NELSON AND SONS, PATERNOSTER ROW;\r\n                       EDINBURGH; AND NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnglishmen have always felt a special interest in the regions of the\r\nicy North, from the days when Dr. Thorne first proposed the search\r\nafter a passage to the Pole, down to these present times, when the\r\nExpedition under Captains Nares and Stephenson has shown that such a\r\npassage is virtually impracticable. The interest originally kindled\r\nby commercial considerations has been maintained by purer and loftier\r\nmotives,--by the thirst after knowledge, and the sympathy with the\r\nbrave deeds of brave men. And it must be admitted that our national\r\nvirtues of resolute perseverance and patient courage have never been\r\nmore happily displayed than in the prosecution of the great work\r\nof Arctic Discovery. Our explorers have refused to know when they\r\nwere beaten; and in defiance of a terrible climate, of icebergs and\r\nice-floes, of hurricanes and driving snow-storms, of obstacles,\r\ndangers, and difficulties, have pressed onward, until the latest\r\nadventurers have crossed the Threshold of the Unknown Region, and\r\nconfronted the immense plain of ice that extends for four hundred miles\r\nfrom the Pole. Their labours, indeed, have been attended by the shadows\r\nof melancholy disasters, and the long Arctic night closes over the\r\ngraves of many whom England was loath to lose; but in their successful\r\nissue they have brought us acquainted with the phenomena of a strange\r\nand wonderful world, and opened up to us a succession of scenes of the\r\nmost remarkable character.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question that in the frozen wastes and snowy\r\nwildernesses lurks a powerful fascination, which proves almost\r\nirresistible to the adventurous spirit. He who has once entered the\r\nArctic World, however great his sufferings, is restless until he\r\nreturns to it. Whether the spell lies in the weird magnificence of\r\nthe scenery, in the splendours of the heavens, in the mystery which\r\nstill hovers over those far-off seas of ice and remote bays, or in\r\nthe excitement of a continual struggle with the forces of Nature, or\r\nwhether all these influences are at work, we cannot stop to inquire.\r\nBut it seems to us certain that the Arctic World has a romance and an\r\nattraction about it, which are far more powerful over the minds of men\r\nthan the rich glowing lands of the Tropics, or the\r\n\r\n    “Summer-isles of Eden lying in dark-purple spheres of sea,”\r\n\r\nwhich are crowned with the bread-fruit and the palm, the spontaneous\r\ngifts of a liberal soil. We follow with far deeper interest the\r\nfootprints of a Parry and a Franklin than those of a Wallis, a\r\nCarteret, or even a Cook.\r\n\r\nThe general reader, therefore, may not be displeased at the attempt of\r\nthe present writer to put before him, with bold touches, and in outline\r\nrather than in detail, a picture of that Polar World which is so\r\nawful and yet so fascinating. In the following pages he will find its\r\nprincipal features sketched, its chief characters legibly and clearly\r\ntraced. They are not intended for the scientific,--though it is hoped\r\nthe scientific, if they fall in with them, will find no ground for\r\ncensure. They aim at describing the wonders of sky and sea and land;\r\nthe glories of the aurora; the beauty of the starry Arctic night; the\r\nmajesty of iceberg and glacier; the rugged dreariness of the hummocky\r\nfields of ice; the habits of the Polar bear, the seal, and the walrus;\r\nand the manners and customs of the various tribes which frequent the\r\nshores of the Polar seas and straits, or dwell on the border-land of\r\nthe Frigid Zone. In a word, it has been the writer’s object to bring\r\ntogether just such particulars as might enable the intelligent reader\r\nto realize to himself the true character of the world which extends\r\naround the North Pole. In carrying out this object, he has necessarily\r\nhad recourse to the voyages of numerous explorers and the narratives of\r\nsundry scientific authorities; and he believes that not a statement has\r\nbeen ventured which could not claim their support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n    Various routes

It is to the North Pole, and the\r\nregions surrounding it, that the following pages will be devoted.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Western Europe, and more particularly those of the\r\nBritish Isles, have a peculiar interest in the North Polar Regions.\r\nDeriving their wealth and importance from their commercial enterprise,\r\nand that commercial enterprise leading their ships and seamen into the\r\nfurthest seas, they have necessarily a vital concern in the discovery\r\nof the shortest possible route from that side of the Earth which they\r\ninhabit to the other, or eastern side; and this, more particularly,\r\nbecause the East is rich in natural productions which are of high value\r\nto the peoples of the West.\r\n\r\nNow a glance at the map will show the reader that the traders\r\nof Western Europe--the British, the French, the Dutch, the\r\nScandinavians--are situated on the northern shores of the Atlantic\r\nOcean, and that, to reach the Pacific Ocean or the Indian, only\r\ntwo routes are at present open. For instance, they may cross the\r\nAtlantic to the American coast, and, keeping southward, strike through\r\nMagellan’s stormy Strait or round the bleak promontory of Cape Horn\r\ninto the Pacific, and then, over some thousands of miles of water,\r\nproceed to Australia or Hindustan or China; or they may keep along\r\nthe African coast to the Cape of Good Hope, its southernmost point,\r\nand so stretch across the warm Tropical seas to India and the Eastern\r\nArchipelago. A third, an _artificial_ route, has indeed of late\r\nyears been opened up; and ships, entering the Mediterranean, may pass\r\nthrough the Suez Canal into the Red Sea. But this last-named route is\r\nunsuitable for sailing-ships, and all three routes are laborious and\r\nslow. How greatly the distance would be shortened were it possible\r\nto navigate the Northern Seas, and, keeping along the north coast of\r\nthe American continent, to descend Behring’s Strait into the Pacific!\r\nIn other words, were that North-West Passage practicable, which, for\r\nthree centuries, our geographers and explorers so assiduously and\r\ncourageously toiled to discover! But a still shorter route would be\r\nopened up, if we could follow a line drawn from the British Islands\r\nstraight across the North Pole to Behring’s Sea and the Aleutian\r\nArchipelago. This line would not exceed 5000 miles in length, and would\r\nbring Japan, China, and India within a very short voyage from Great\r\nBritain. We should be able to reach Japan in three or four weeks, to\r\nthe obvious advantage of our extensive commerce.\r\n\r\nHitherto, however, all efforts to follow out this route, and to throw\r\nopen this great ocean-highway between Europe and Asia, have failed. Man\r\nhas been baffled by Nature; by ice, and frost, and winds, and climatic\r\ninfluences. With heroic perseverance he has sought to gain the open\r\nsea which, it is believed, surrounds the Pole, but a barrier of ice\r\nhas invariably arrested his progress. His researches have carried him\r\nwithin about 500 miles of the coveted point; but he is as yet unable\r\nto move a step beyond this furthest limit of geographical discovery.\r\nImmediately around the North Pole, within a radius of eight to ten\r\ndegrees or more, according to locality, still lies an Unknown Region,\r\non the threshold of which Science stands expectant, eagerly looking\r\nforward to the day when human skill and human courage shall penetrate\r\nits solitudes and reveal its secrets.\r\n\r\nThis Unknown Region comprises an area of 2,500,000 square miles; an\r\nimmense portion of the terrestrial surface to be shut out from the\r\nknowledge of Civilized Man. Its further exploration, if practicable,\r\ncannot but be rich in valuable results. Not only would it furnish the\r\nshortest route from the West to the East, from progressive Europe to\r\nconservative Asia, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, but it could not\r\nfail to add in a very important degree to our stores of scientific\r\ninformation. Sir Edward Sabine is surely right when he says, that it is\r\nthe greatest geographical achievement which can be attempted, and that\r\nit will be the crowning enterprise of those Arctic researches in which\r\nEngland has hitherto had the pre-eminence.\r\n\r\nWe may briefly indicate to the reader some of the advantages which\r\nmight be expected from exploration in the Unknown Region. It would\r\nunquestionably advance the science of hydrography, and lead to a\r\nsolution of some of the more difficult problems connected with the\r\nEquatorial and Polar ocean-currents, those great movements of the\r\nwaters of which, as yet, we know so little.\r\n\r\nA series of pendulum observations, it is said, at and near the North\r\nPole, would be of essential service to the science of geology. We are\r\nunable, at present, for want of sufficient data, to form a mathematical\r\ntheory of the physical condition of the Earth, and to ascertain its\r\nexact configuration. No pendulum observations have been taken nearer\r\nthan 600 or 620 miles to the North Pole.\r\n\r\nAgain: what precious information respecting the strange and wonderful\r\nphenomena of magnetism and atmospheric electricity would certainly be\r\nacquired! How much we have yet to learn in reference to the Aurora,\r\nwhich can be learned only in high latitudes, and at or near the point\r\nwhich apparently represents a magnetic focus or centre!\r\n\r\nIt has also been pointed out by Mr. Markham that the climate of Europe\r\nis largely affected by the atmospheric conditions of the Polar area, in\r\nwhich the development of extremely low temperatures necessarily leads\r\nto corresponding extreme changes of pressure, and other atmospheric\r\ndisturbances, whose influence extends far into the Temperate Zone. For\r\nthe satisfactory appreciation of these phenomena, says Mr. Markham, a\r\nprecise knowledge is required of the distribution of land and water\r\nwithin the Polar Region; and any addition to our knowledge of its\r\nunknown area, accompanied by suitable observations of its meteorology,\r\ncannot fail to afford improved means of understanding the meteorology\r\nof our own country, and of the Earth generally.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt, too, that geology would profit, if we could\r\npush our researches nearer to the Pole, and force our way through the\r\ngreat barrier of the Polar ice. It is highly desirable, too, that we\r\nshould know more of that interesting class of animals, the Mollusca,\r\nboth terrestrial and aquatic, fresh-water and salt-water. Again: what\r\na wide field of inquiry is opened up by the Polar glaciers; their\r\nextent, their elevation, their range, and the effects produced by the\r\nslow but continuous motion of those huge ice-rivers over the surface\r\nof the country. And the botanist has a right to calculate upon the\r\ndiscovery of many precious forms of vegetable life in the Unknown\r\nRegion. The Arctic flora is by no means abundant, but it is peculiarly\r\ninteresting. In Greenland, besides numerous mosses, lichens, algæ, and\r\nthe like, flourish three hundred kinds of flowering plants, all of\r\nwhich are natives of the Scandinavian peninsula; and Dr. Joseph Hooker\r\nremarks that they exhibit scarcely any admixture of American types,\r\nthough these are found on the opposite coast of Labrador. It would seem\r\nprobable that in the warm period which preceded the Glacial Age, the\r\nScandinavian flora spread over the entire area of the Polar Regions;\r\nbut that during the Age of Ice it was gradually driven within its\r\npresent limits, only the hardier types surviving the blight of the long\r\nlingering winter.\r\n\r\nAnd what would be the gain to the zoologist? Why, it is a well-known\r\nfact that life abounds in the Arctic waters, and especially those\r\nminute organisms which play so important a part in the formation of\r\nsedimentary deposits, and help to build up the terrestrial crust. We\r\nhave much to learn, moreover, of the habits and habitats of the fish,\r\nthe echinoderms, the molluscs, the corals, the sponges of the extreme\r\nNorthern Seas.\r\n\r\nThere are questions connected with the migrations of birds which can\r\nbe elucidated only by an exploration of the Unknown Region. Multitudes\r\nwhich annually visit our shores in the winter and spring, return in\r\nsummer to the far North. This is their regular custom, and obviously\r\nwould not have become a custom unless it had been found beneficial.\r\nTherefore we may assume that in the zone they frequent they find some\r\nwater which is not always frozen; some land on which they can rest\r\ntheir weary feet; and an adequate supply of nourishing food.\r\n\r\nFrom Professor Newton we adopt, in connection with this consideration,\r\na brief account of the movements of one class of migratory birds,--the\r\nKnots.[1]\r\n\r\nThe knot, or sandpiper, is something half-way between a snipe and a\r\nplover. It is a very active and graceful bird, with rather long legs,\r\nmoderately long wings, and a very short tail. It swims admirably, but\r\nis not often seen in the water; preferring to assemble with its fellows\r\non the sandy sea-shores, where it gropes in the sand for food, or\r\nfishes in the rock-pools and shallow waters for the small crustaceans.\r\nIt is known both as the red and the ash-coloured sandpiper, because\r\nit changes the colour of its plumage according to the season of the\r\nyear; a bright red in summer, a sober ashen-gray in winter. Now, in the\r\nspring the knot seeks our island in immense flocks, and after remaining\r\non the coasts for about a fortnight, can be traced proceeding gradually\r\nnorthwards, until it finally takes leave of us. It has been noticed\r\nin Iceland and Greenland, but not to stay; the summer there would be\r\ntoo rigorous for its liking, and it goes further and further north.\r\nWhither? Where does it build its nest, and hatch its young? We lose all\r\ntrace of it for some weeks: what becomes of it?\r\n\r\nTowards the end of summer back it comes to us in larger flocks than\r\nbefore, and both old birds and young birds remain upon our coasts until\r\nNovember, or, in mild seasons, even later. Then it wings its flight\r\nto the south, and luxuriates in blue skies and balmy airs until the\r\nfollowing spring, when it resumes the order of its migrations.\r\n\r\nCommenting upon these facts, Professor Newton infers that the lands\r\nvisited by the knot in the middle of summer are less sterile than\r\nIceland or Greenland; for certainly it would not pass over these\r\ncountries, which are known to be the breeding-places for swarms of\r\nwater-birds, to resort to regions not so well provided with supplies of\r\nfood. The _food_, however, chiefly depends on the _climate_.\r\nWherefore we conclude that beyond the northern tracts already explored\r\nlies a region enjoying in summer a climate more genial than they\r\npossess.\r\n\r\nDo any races of men with which we are now unacquainted inhabit the\r\nUnknown Region? Mr. Markham observes that although scarcely one-half\r\nof the Arctic world has been explored, yet numerous traces of former\r\ninhabitants have been found in wastes which are at present abandoned\r\nto the silence and solitude. Man would seem to migrate as well as the\r\ninferior animals, and it is possible that tribes may be dwelling in the\r\nmysterious inner zone between the Pole and the known Polar countries.\r\n\r\nThe extreme points reached by our explorers on the ice-bound Greenland\r\ncoast are in about 82° on the west, and 76° on the east side; these\r\ntwo points lying about six hundred miles apart. As man has dwelt at\r\nboth these points, and as they are separated from the settlements\r\nfurther south by a dreary, desolate, uninhabitable interval, it is\r\nnot an extravagant conjecture that the unknown land to the north has\r\nbeen or is inhabited. In 1818 a small tribe was discovered on the\r\nbleak Greenland coast between 76° and 79° N.; their southward range\r\nbeing bounded by the glaciers of Melville Bay, and their northward by\r\nthe colossal mass of the Humboldt Glacier, while inland their way is\r\nbarred by the _Sernik-sook_, a great glacier of the interior.\r\nThese so-called Arctic Highlanders number about one hundred and forty\r\nsouls, and their existence “depends on open pools and lanes of water\r\nthroughout the winter, which attract animal life.” Wherever such\r\nconditions as these are found, man may be found.\r\n\r\nWe know that there are or have been inhabitants north of the Humboldt\r\nGlacier, on the very threshold of the Unknown Region; for Dr. Kane’s\r\nexpedition discovered the runner of a sledge made of bone lying on the\r\nbeach immediately to the north of it. The Arctic Highlanders, moreover,\r\ncherish a tradition that herds of musk-oxen frequent an island situated\r\nfar away to the north in an iceless sea. Traces of these animals were\r\nfound by Captain Hall’s expedition, in 1871–72, as far north as 81°\r\n30′; and similar indications have been noted on the eastern side of\r\nGreenland. In 1823, Captain Clavering found twelve natives at Cape\r\nBorlase Warren, in lat. 79° N.; but when Captain Koldewey, of the\r\nGerman expedition, wintered in the same neighbourhood, in 1869, they\r\nhad disappeared, though there were traces of their occupancy, and ample\r\nmeans of subsistence. Yet they cannot have gone southward, owing to\r\ninsuperable natural obstacles; they must have moved towards the North\r\nPole.\r\n\r\nWe have thus indicated some of the results which may be anticipated\r\nfrom further researches in the Unknown Region. It is not to be\r\nforgotten, however, that “the unexpected always happens,” and it is\r\nimpossible to calculate definitely the consequences which may ensue\r\nfrom a more extensive investigation. “Columbus,” it has been justly\r\nsaid, “found very few to sympathize with him, or perceive the utility\r\nof the effort on his part to go out into the unknown waste of waters\r\nbeyond the Strait of Gibraltar, in search of a new country. Who can,\r\nat this time, estimate the advantages which have followed upon that\r\nadventure? If now it should be possible to reach the Pole, and to make\r\naccurate observations at that point, from the relation which the Earth\r\nbears to the sun and to the whole stellar universe, the most useful\r\nresults are very likely to follow, in a more thorough knowledge of our\r\nglobe.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader has now before him the particulars which will enable him to\r\nform an idea of the extent and character of the undiscovered region\r\nof the Pole. Roughly speaking, it is bounded by the 80th parallel of\r\nlatitude on the European side, except at a few points where our gallant\r\nexplorers have succeeded in crossing the threshold; on the Asiatic side\r\nit descends as low as 75°; and to the west of Behring Strait as low\r\nas 72°. Thus, it varies from 500 or 600 to 1400 or 1500 miles across.\r\nBelow these parallels, and bounded by the Arctic Circle, or, in some\r\nplaces, by the 60th parallel, extends a vast belt of land and water\r\nwhich is generally known as the Arctic or Circumpolar Regions. These\r\nhave been more or less thoroughly explored; and it is to a description\r\nof their principal features, their forms of animal and vegetable life,\r\nand their natural phenomena, that we propose to devote the present\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A DESERT OF ICE IN THE ARCTIC REGION.]\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember that the northern shores of Europe, Asia,\r\nand America are skirted by the parallel of 70°, and that the belt\r\nbetween the 70th and 80th parallels, having been partially explored\r\nby the seamen and travellers of various nations, intervenes as a kind\r\nof neutral ground between the known and the unknown. We may, indeed,\r\nformulate our statement thus; from the Pole to the 80th degree\r\nstretches the unknown; from the 80th to the 70th, the partially known;\r\nwhile, south of the 70th, we traverse the lands and seas which human\r\nenterprise has completely conquered.\r\n\r\nThe Circumpolar Zone includes the northernmost portions of the three\r\ngreat continents, Europe, Asia, and America; and by sea it has three\r\napproaches or gateways: one, through the Northern Ocean, between Norway\r\nand Greenland; another, through Davis Strait,--both these being from\r\nthe Atlantic; and a third, through Behring Strait,--the entrance from\r\nthe Pacific.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the Circumpolar Regions, as they are now\r\nunderstood, and as we shall describe them in the following pages,\r\nextend to the south of that imaginary line drawn by geographers round\r\nthe North Pole, at a distance from it equal to the obliquity of the\r\necliptic, or 23° 30’. Within this circle, however, there is a period of\r\nthe year when the sun does not set; while there is another when he is\r\nnever seen, when a settled gloom spreads over the face of nature,--this\r\nperiod being longer or shorter at any given point according as that\r\npoint is nearer to or further from the Pole.\r\n\r\nBut as animal and vegetable life are largely affected by climate,\r\nit may be justly said that wherever an Arctic climate prevails\r\n_there_ we shall find an Arctic or Polar region; and, hence, many\r\ncountries below even the 60th parallel, such as Kamtschatka, Labrador,\r\nand South Greenland, fall within the Circumpolar boundary.\r\n\r\nThe waters surrounding the North Pole bear the general designation\r\nof the Arctic Ocean. But here again it is almost impossible to\r\nparticularize any uniform limit southward. It joins the Pacific at\r\nBehring Strait in about lat. 66° N., and consequently in this quarter\r\nextends fully half a degree _beyond_ the Arctic Circle. At\r\nScoresby Sound, as at North Cape, where it meets the Atlantic, it is\r\nintersected by the parallel of 71°, and consequently falls short of the\r\nArctic Circle by about 4° 30’.\r\n\r\nIn the Old World, the Polar Ocean, if we include its gulfs, extends, in\r\nthe White Sea, fully two degrees _beyond_ the Arctic Circle; while\r\nat Cape Severo, the northernmost point of Asia, in lat. 78° 25’ N., it\r\nis 11° 55’ distance from it. Finally, in the New World it is everywhere\r\nconfined _within_ the Circle; as much as 5° at Point Barrow, about\r\n7° 30’ at Barrow Strait, and about 3° at the Hecla and Fury Strait.\r\n\r\nWe may add that, so far as temperature is concerned, the great gulfs\r\nknown, in memory of their discoverers, as Davis Strait, Baffin Bay, and\r\nHudson Bay, are portions of the Arctic Ocean.\r\n\r\nOf the more southerly area of this great ocean, the only section which\r\nhas been adequately explored to a distance from the continent, and\r\nin the direction of the Pole, is that which washes the north-east\r\nof America. Here we meet, under the collective name of the Polar\r\nArchipelago, with the following islands:--Banks Land, Wollaston Land,\r\nPrince Albert Land, Victoria Land, Prince Patrick Island, Princess\r\nRoyal Islands, Melville Island, Cornwallis Island, North Devon, Beechey\r\nIsland, Grinnell Land, and North Lincoln. Further to the east lie\r\nSpitzbergen, Jan Mayen Island, Novaia Zemlaia, New Siberia, and the\r\nLiakhov Islands. The chief straits and inlets are Lancaster Sound,\r\nBarrow Strait, Smith Sound, Regent Inlet, Hecla and Fury Strait,\r\nWellington Channel, and Cumberland Sound; while further westward are\r\nBelcher Channel, Melville Sound, M’Clintock Channel, Banks Strait, and\r\nPrince of Wales Strait.\r\n\r\nThe Arctic Lands comprehend two well-defined sections, or zones; that\r\nof the forests, and the treeless wastes.\r\n\r\nTo the latter belong the islands within the Arctic Circle, and also a\r\nconsiderable tract of the northern continents, forming the “barrens” of\r\nNorth America, and the “tundras” and “steppes” of European Russia and\r\nSiberia.\r\n\r\nThe treeless character of this vast area of wilderness is owing to\r\nthe bleak sea-winds which drive, without let or hindrance, across the\r\nislands and level shores of the Polar Ocean, compelling even the most\r\nvigorous plant to bend before them and creep along the ground.\r\n\r\nDrearier scenes are nowhere presented than these stony tundras, or\r\ntheir boundless swamps. Almost the only vegetation are a few gray\r\nlichens, a few dull blackish-looking mosses; the stunted flowers or\r\ncrawling grasses that here and there occur do not relieve the uniform\r\ndesolation,--they serve simply to enhance its gloomy character. In\r\nsummer, indeed, the tundras are full of life; for the spawning instinct\r\nof the salmon and the sturgeon impels them to enter their rivers\r\nand seek the quiet recesses of their mysterious lakes. The reindeer\r\nassemble in numerous herds to feed on the herbage warmed into temporary\r\nvitality by the upward-slanting sun; the whirr of countless wings\r\nannounces the coming of the migratory birds to breed, and feed their\r\nyoung, on the river-banks and the level shores; and in their trail\r\narrive the eagle and the hawk, intent on prey.\r\n\r\nBut with the first days of September a change passes over the scene.\r\nAnimal life hastens to the more genial south; the birds abandon the\r\nfrozen wastes; the reindeer retires to the shelter of the forests;\r\nthe fish desert the ice-bound streams; and a terrible silence reigns\r\nin the desolate wilderness, broken only by the harsh yelp of a fox or\r\nthe melancholy hooting of a snow-owl. For some eight or nine months a\r\ndeep shroud or pall of snow lies on the whitened plains. No cheerful\r\nsunbeams irradiate it with a rosy glow; the sky is dull and dark; and\r\nit seems as if Nature had been abandoned to eternal Night.\r\n\r\nBut blank and dreary as the limitless expanse of snow appears, it is\r\nthe security of man in these far northern regions. It affords the\r\nnecessary protection to the scanty vegetable life against the rigour\r\nof the long winter season. In Rensselaer Bay, Dr. Kane found, when the\r\nsurface temperature had sunk to -30°, a temperature at two feet deep\r\nof -8°, at four feet deep of +2°, and at eight feet deep of +26°, or\r\nno more than 6° below freezing-point. Hence, underneath their thick\r\nfrozen pall, the Arctic grasses and lichens maintain a struggling\r\nexistence, and are able to maintain it until thoroughly resuscitated\r\nby the summer sun. It is owing to this wise and beneficent provision\r\nthat, in the highest latitudes, the explorer discovers some feeble\r\nforms of vegetation. Thus, as Hartwig reminds us, Morton gathered a\r\ncrucifer at Cape Constitution, in lat. 80° 45’ N.; and Dr. Kane, on the\r\nbanks of the Minturn River, in lat. 78° 52’, met with a flower-growth\r\nwhich, though fully Arctic in its type, was gaily and richly\r\ncoloured--including the purple lychnis, the starry chickweed, and the\r\nhesperis, among the festuca and other tufted grasses.\r\n\r\nIn the tundras, the most abundant vegetable forms, next to the\r\nlichens and mosses, are the grasses, the crucifers, the saxifrages,\r\nthe caryophyles, and the compositæ. These grow fewer and fewer as we\r\nmove towards the north, but the number of individual plants does not\r\ndecrease. Where the soil is fairly dry, we shall find an extensive\r\ngrowth of lichens; in moister grounds, these are intermingled with\r\nthe well-known Iceland moss. Lichens are everywhere, except in the\r\nsparse tracts of meadow-land lying at the foot of sheltering hills,\r\nor in those alluvial inundated hollows which are thickly planted with\r\n“whispering reeds” and dwarf willows.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to trace exactly the boundary between the tundras and\r\nthe forest zone. The former descend to the south, and the latter\r\nadvances to the north, according to the climatic influences which\r\nprevail; following the isothermic lines of uniform temperature, and\r\nnot the mathematical limits of the geographical parallels of latitude.\r\nWhere the ground undulates, and hilly ridges break the fury of the\r\nicy blasts, the forests encroach on the stony treeless region; but\r\nthe desolate plains strike into the wooded zone in places where the\r\nocean-winds range with unchecked sway.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE SWAMPS OF THE OBI.]\r\n\r\nThe southernmost limit of the “barrens” is found in Labrador, where\r\nthey descend to lat. 57°; nor is this to be wondered at, when we\r\nremember the peculiar position of that gloomy peninsula, with icy seas\r\nwashing it on three sides, and cold winds sweeping over it from the\r\nnorth. On the opposite coasts of Hudson Bay they do not strike lower\r\nthan 60°; and they continue to rise as we proceed westward, until in\r\nthe Mackenzie Valley we find the tall forest growth reaching as far\r\nnorth as 68° or even 70°. Thence they recede gradually, until, on the\r\nbleak shore of Behring Sea, they do not rise higher than 65°. Crossing\r\ninto the eastern continent, we find them beginning, in the land of the\r\nTuski (or Tchuktche), in 63°, and from thence encroaching gradually\r\nupon the tundras until, at the Lena, they reach as high as 71°. From\r\nthe Lena to the Obi the tundras gain upon the forests, and in the\r\nObi Valley descend below the Arctic Circle; but from the Obi to the\r\nScandinavian coast the forests gain upon the tundras, terminating,\r\nafter many variations, in lat. 70°.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: IN THE FOREST ZONE OF THE NORTH.]\r\n\r\nThe result to which this rapid survey brings us is, that the “tundras”\r\nor “barrens” of Europe, Asia, and America occupy an area larger than\r\nthe whole of Europe. The Siberian wilderness is more extensive than the\r\nAfrican Sahara or the South American Pampas. But of still vaster area\r\nare the Arctic forest regions, which stretch in an “almost continuous\r\nbelt” through three quarters of the world, with a breadth of from\r\n15° to 20°--that is, of 1000 to 1400 miles. And it is a peculiarity\r\nof these Circumpolar woods, that they are almost wholly composed of\r\nconifers, and that frequently a wide space of ground is covered for\r\nleagues upon leagues with a single kind of fir or pine.\r\n\r\n    “This is the forest primeval. The murmuring pines and the hemlocks,\r\n    Blended with moss, and in garments green, indistinct in the twilight,\r\n    Stand like Druids of eld, with voices sad and prophetic,\r\n    Stand like harpers hoar, with beards that rest on their bosoms.”\r\n\r\nThe American species, however, differ from the Asiatic or European.\r\nWhile in the Hudson Bay territories grow the white and black spruce,[2]\r\nthe Canadian larch,[3] and the gray pine[4]; in Scandinavia and\r\nSiberia, the Siberian fir and larch,[5] the _Picea olovata_, and\r\nthe _Pinus umbra_ flourish. But both in the Old World and the\r\nNew the birch advances beyond the fir and pine, and on the banks of\r\nthe rivers and the shores of the lakes dwarf willows form immense and\r\nalmost impenetrable thickets. The Arctic forests also include various\r\nkinds of ash, elder, and the service tree; and though orchard trees are\r\nwholly wanting, both man and beast find a great boon in the bilberries,\r\ncranberries, bog-berries, and the like, which grow plentifully in many\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\nThe area of the Arctic flora comprises Greenland, in the western\r\nhemisphere, and extends considerably to the south of the Arctic Circle,\r\nespecially on the coasts, where it reaches the parallel of 60° N. lat.,\r\nand even overpasses it.\r\n\r\nIn Greenland the vegetation is more truly of an Arctic character than\r\neven in Iceland. The valleys are covered with marsh-plants and dingy\r\nmosses; the gloomy rocks are encrusted with lichens; while the grasses\r\non the meadow-lands that border the fiords and inlets are nearly four\r\ntimes less varied than those of Iceland.\r\n\r\nThe flora of Iceland is approximative to that of Great Britain; yet\r\nonly one in every four of British plants is included in it. The total\r\nnumber of species may be computed at eight hundred and seventy, of\r\nwhich more than half blossom; this proportion is greater than prevails\r\nin Scotland, but then only thirty-two are of woody texture. They are\r\nscattered about in groups according as they prefer a marshy, volcanic,\r\ndry, or marine soil. Many bloom in the immediate vicinity of the hot\r\nsprings; some not far from the brink of the basin of the Great Geyser,\r\nwhere every other plant is petrified; and several species of confervæ\r\nflourish in a spring the waters of which are hot enough, it is said, to\r\nboil an egg.\r\n\r\nFrom the nature of the Arctic forests, the reader will be prepared to\r\nlearn that they are not inhabited, like those of the Tropics, by swarms\r\nof animals; or made musical by the songs of birds, like our European\r\nwoods. Even the echoes are silent, except when the hoarse wind bears\r\nto them the peculiar cry of the reindeer, the howl of the wolf, or the\r\nsharp scream of some bird of prey. Insect life, however, is active and\r\nabundant; and our Arctic travellers have suffered greatly from the\r\nlegions of gnats which haunt their swampy recesses.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPassing from the forest region into the treeless wastes, we may glance\r\nonce again at their strikingly impressive features. North of the 62nd\r\nparallel no corn can ripen, on account of the fatal power of the winds\r\nwhich pour down from the Arctic Ocean. As we advance to the northward,\r\na wide-spread area of desolation stretches before us: salt steppes,\r\nstony plains, boundless swamps, and lakes of salt and fresh water. So\r\nterrible is the cold that the spongy soil is perpetually frozen to the\r\ndepth of some hundred feet below the surface; and the surface itself,\r\nthough not thawed until the end of June, is again ice-bound by the\r\nmiddle of September. One of the most graphic sketches with which we are\r\nacquainted of the extreme Siberian desert is furnished by Admiral von\r\nWrangel, who travelled during the winter from the mouth of the Kolyma\r\nto Behring Strait.\r\n\r\nHere, he says, endless snows and ice-crusted rocks bound the horizon;\r\nNature lies shrouded in all but perpetual winter; life is a constant\r\nconflict with privation and with the terrors of cold and hunger; the\r\ngrave of Nature, containing only the bones of another world. The\r\npeople, and even the snow, throw off a continual vapour; and this\r\nevaporation is instantly changed into millions of needles of ice, which\r\nmake a noise in the air like the sound of torn satin or the rustle of\r\nthick silk. The reindeer take to the forest, or crowd together for\r\nheat; and the raven alone, the dark bird of winter, still smites the\r\nfrosty air with heavy laborious wing, leaving behind him a long trail\r\nof thin vapour to mark the course of his solitary flight. The trunks\r\nof the thickest trees are rent with a loud clang, masses of rock\r\nare torn from their sites, the ground in the valleys is split into\r\na myriad fissures, from which the waters that are underneath bubble\r\nup, throwing off a cloud of smoke, and immediately congealing into\r\nice. The atmosphere grows dense; the glistening stars are dimmed. The\r\ndogs outside the huts of the Siberians burrow in the snow, and their\r\nhowling, at intervals of six or eight hours, interrupts the general\r\nsilence of winter.\r\n\r\nThe abundance of fur-bearing animals in the less rigorous parts of the\r\ntundras has induced the hardy Russians to colonize and build towns on\r\nthese confines of the Frozen World. Yakutsk, on the river Lena, in\r\n62° 1′ 30″ N., may be regarded, perhaps, as the coldest town on the\r\nEarth. The ground is perpetually frozen to the depth of more than 400\r\nfeet, of which three feet only are thawed in summer, when Fahrenheit’s\r\nthermometer frequently marks 77° in the shade. Yet in winter the rigour\r\nof the climate is so extreme that mercury is constantly frozen for two\r\nand occasionally even for three months.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the data set forth in the preceding pages, the reader will\r\nconclude that, as indeed results from physical laws, the line of\r\nperpetual snow will be found to descend lower and lower on advancing to\r\nthe Pole. By the line of perpetual snow we mean, of course, the limit\r\nabove which a continual frost endures. Now, this limit varies according\r\nto climate. The lower the temperature, the lower the snow-line; the\r\nhigher the temperature, the higher the snow-line. In the Tropics it\r\ndoes not sink below the summits of the loftiest mountains. Thus, at\r\n1° from the Equator, where the mean temperature at the sea-level is\r\n84°.2, the snow-line must be sought at the elevation of 15,203 feet;\r\nin 51° 30’ lat., the latitude of London, it is usually found at about\r\n5900 feet; in lat. 80°, where the mean temperature is 33°.6, it sinks\r\nto 457 feet. These figures, however, represent its _normal_\r\nelevations; but temperature, as we all know, is greatly affected by\r\nlocal circumstances, and therefore the perpetual snow-line varies\r\ngreatly in height. Owing to causes already explained, the snow-line\r\nin the Circumpolar Regions sinks to a very low level; and, therefore,\r\nmany mountainous regions or elevated table-lands, such as Spitzbergen,\r\nGreenland, and Novaia Zemlaia, which, in a more temperate climate,\r\nwould bloom with emerald slopes and waving woods, are covered with\r\nhuge glaciers and fields of ice, with apparently interminable reaches\r\nof untrodden snow.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted, however, that nowhere does the perpetual snow-line\r\ndescend to the water’s edge; nowhere has the spell of winter absolutely\r\ncrushed the life out of all vegetation. Lichens and grasses, on which\r\nthe reindeer gains its hardy subsistence, are found near lat. 80°; even\r\non the awful plains of Melville Island the snow melts at midsummer;\r\nand the deserts of New Siberia afford food for considerable numbers of\r\nlemmings. As far as man has reached to the north, says a popular and\r\naccurate writer, vegetation, when fostered by a sheltered situation\r\nand the refraction of solar heat from the rocks, has everywhere been\r\nfound to rise to a considerable altitude above the level of the sea;\r\nand should there be land at the North Pole, we may reasonably suppose\r\nthat it is destitute neither of animal nor vegetable life. It would be\r\nquite wrong to conclude that the cold of winter invariably increases\r\nas we approach the Pole, the temperature of a land being controlled\r\nby many other causes besides its latitude. Even in the most northern\r\nregions visited by man, the influence of the sea, particularly where\r\nfavoured by warm currents, considerably mitigates the severity of the\r\nwinter, while at the same time it diminishes the heat of summer. On the\r\nother hand, the large continental tracts of Asia or America that slope\r\ntowards the Pole, possess a more rigorous winter and a fiercer summer\r\nthan many coast lands or islands situated far nearer to the Pole. For\r\nexample: the western shores of Novaia Zemlaia, fronting a wide expanse\r\nof sea, have an average winter temperature of only -4°, and a mean\r\nsummer temperature which rises very little above the freezing-point of\r\nwater (+ 36° 30’); while Yakutsk, situated in the centre of Siberia,\r\nand 20° nearer to the Equator, has a winter temperature of -36° 6’, and\r\na summer of + 66° 6’.\r\n\r\nBut though such are the physical conditions of the Polar Regions, it\r\nmust not be supposed that Nature wears only a severe and repellent\r\naspect. There is something beautiful in the vast expanse of snowy plain\r\nwhen seen by the light of a cloudless moon; something majestic in the\r\ncolossal glaciers which fill up the remote Arctic valleys; something\r\npicturesque in the numerous icebergs which grandly sail down the dark\r\nPolar waters; something mysterious and wonderful in the coruscations of\r\nthe Aurora, which illuminates the darkness of the winter nights with\r\nthe glory of the celestial fires. The law of compensation prevails in\r\nthe far North, as in the glowing and exuberant regions of the Tropics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n        THE ARCTIC HEAVENS: ATMOSPHERIC AND METEORIC PHENOMENA.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet the reader fancy himself--should he be reading these pages on a\r\nwarm summer’s day, the fancy will not be unpleasant!--let the reader\r\nfancy himself on board a well-found, stoutly-built whaling-vessel,\r\nand rapidly approaching the coast of Greenland. But the heavy mist\r\nhangs over the legend-haunted shores, and we can but catch the sound\r\nof the clanging surf as it rolls upon them. All around us spreads the\r\nmist,--dense, impenetrable. What is that before us? The dead white mass\r\nof an iceberg, slowly drifting with the current, and almost upon us\r\nbefore the look-out man discovered it. But the helm has been sharply\r\nhandled; our good ship has put about; and we sail clear of the mighty\r\npyramid. Fully one hundred and fifty feet high, we can assure you, and\r\ntwice as broad at its base. A sudden break in the mist reveals its\r\nradiant spire, with white cloud-wreaths circling and dancing round it\r\nin the sunlight.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as we steadily move forward, the fog is lifted up like a\r\ncurtain, and before us, like a scene in a panorama, looms the Greenland\r\ncoast in all its austere magnificence: yonder are its broad ice-filled\r\nvalleys, its snow-clad ravines, its noble mountains, its iron-bound\r\nrange of cliffs, its general aspect of solemn desolation.\r\n\r\nAway over the westward sea fly the scattered vapours, disclosing\r\niceberg after iceberg, like the magical towers in some of Turner’s\r\npictures. We seem to have been drawn by some irresistible spell into\r\na world of enchantment, and all the old Norse romance comes back\r\nupon the memory, with its picturesque associations. Yonder lies the\r\nValhalla of the ancient ocean-rovers; yonder the dazzling city of the\r\nsun-god Freya, one of the most popular of the Scandinavian divinities,\r\nas well he might be; yonder the elfin caves of Alfheim; and Glitner,\r\nwith its walls of gold and roofs of silver; and the radiant Gimele,\r\nthe home of the blessed; and there, too, towering above the clouds,\r\nthe bridge Bifrost, by which the heroes ascended from earth to heaven.\r\nHeimdall, who can see for fully a hundred leagues, as well by night as\r\nby day, stands sentinel upon it, prepared to sound his horn Gjallar, if\r\nintruders should attempt to cross it!\r\n\r\nThe sea is smooth as glass; not a ripple breaks the wonderful calmness\r\nof its surface. It is midnight, but in this strange Arctic world the\r\nsun still hangs close upon the northern horizon; the icebergs rear\r\ntheir dazzling crests around, like floating spires, and turrets, and\r\nmany-towered minsters; the dark headlands are boldly outlined against\r\nthe sky; and sea, and sky, and mountains, and icebergs are suffused\r\nin a wildly beautiful atmosphere of crimson, gold, and purple. The\r\npicture is like a poet’s vision; and so startlingly unreal, that it is\r\ndifficult for the unaccustomed spectator to believe it other than an\r\nillusion.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE MIDNIGHT SUN.]\r\n\r\nWe adopt the following description from the vivid language of Dr.\r\nHayes, who displays a keen feeling for the beauties of the Polar world.\r\n\r\nThe air was warm, he says, almost as a summer’s night at home, and\r\nyet there were the icebergs and the bleak mountains, with which the\r\nfancy, in our own land of green hills and waving woods, can associate\r\nnothing but what is cold and repellent. Bright was the sky, and soft\r\nand strangely inspiring as the skies of Italy. The bergs had wholly\r\nlost their chilly aspect, and, glittering in the blaze of the brilliant\r\nheavens, seemed, in the distance, like masses of burnished metal or\r\nsolid flame. Nearer at hand they were huge blocks of Parian marble,\r\nencrusted with colossal gems of pearl and opal. One in particular\r\nexhibited the perfection of grandeur. Its form was not unlike that of\r\nthe Coliseum, and it lay so far away that half its height was buried\r\nbeneath the line of blood-red waters. The sun, slow moving along its\r\npath of glory, passed behind it, and the old Roman ruin seemed suddenly\r\nto break into flame.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: OFF THE COAST OF GREENLAND.]\r\n\r\nNothing, indeed, but the pencil of the artist could depict the\r\nwonderful richness of this combined landscape and seascape. Church, in\r\nhis great picture of “The Icebergs,” has grandly exhibited a scene not\r\nunlike that we have attempted to describe.\r\n\r\nIn the shadows of the bergs the water was a rich green, and nothing\r\ncould be more soft and tender than the gradations of colour made by the\r\nsea shoaling on the sloping tongues of some of these floating masses.\r\nThe tint increased in intensity where the ice overhung the waters,\r\nand a deep cavern in one of them exhibited the solid colour of the\r\nmalachite mingled with the transparency of the emerald, while, in\r\nstrange contrast, a broad belt of cobalt blue shot diagonally through\r\nits body.\r\n\r\nThe enchantment of the scene was heightened by a thousand little\r\ncascades which flashed into the sea from the icebergs, the water being\r\ndischarged from basins of melted snow and ice which tranquilly reposed\r\nfar up in the hollows of their topmost surface. From other bergs large\r\nboulders were occasionally detached, and these plunged into the water\r\nwith a deafening din, while the roll and rush of the ocean resounded\r\nlike the music of a solemn dirge through their broken archways.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe contrasts and combinations of colour in the Polar world are,\r\nindeed, among its particular attractions, and of their kind they cannot\r\nbe surpassed or imitated even in the gorgeous realms of the Tropics.\r\nThe pale azure gleam of the ice, the dazzling whiteness of the snow,\r\nthe vivid verdure of the sunlit plains, the deep emerald tints, crossed\r\nwith sapphire and ultramarine, of the waters, would in themselves\r\nafford a multiplicity of rich and beautiful effects; but to these we\r\nmust add the magical influences of the coruscations of the Arctic\r\nheavens, with the glories of the midnight sun and the wonders of the\r\nAurora.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MOONLIGHT IN THE POLAR WORLD.]\r\n\r\nEven moonlight in the Polar world is unlike moonlight anywhere else; it\r\nhas a character all its own,--strange, weird, supernatural. Night after\r\nnight the sky will be free from cloud or shadow, and the radiant stars\r\nshine out with a singular intensity, seeming to cut the air like keen\r\nswords. The moonbeams are thrown back with a pale lustre by ice-floe\r\nand glacier and snow-drift, and the only relief to the brightness is\r\nwhere the dark cliffs throw a shadow over the landscape. Gloriously\r\nbeautiful look the snow-clad mountains, as the moonlight pours upon\r\nthem its serene splendour, interrupted only by the occasional passage\r\nof a wreath of mist, which is soon transformed into sparkling silver.\r\nThe whole scene produces an impression of awe on the mind of the\r\nthoughtful spectator, and he feels as if brought face to face with the\r\nvisible presence of another world.\r\n\r\nThe prolonged winter night is in itself well calculated to affect the\r\nimagination of the European. He reads of it in travels and books of\r\nastronomy; but to know what it _is_, and what it _means_, he\r\nmust submit himself to its influence,--he must “winter” in the Polar\r\nRegions. Not to see sunrise and sunset, and the changes they bring with\r\nthem, day after day, enlivening, inspiriting, strengthening, is felt\r\nat first as an intolerable burden. The stars shining at all hours with\r\nequal brilliancy, and the lasting darkness which reigns for twenty\r\ndays of each winter month when the moon is below the horizon, become a\r\nweariness and a discomfort. The traveller longs for the reappearance\r\nof the moon; and yet before she has run her ten days’ course, he feels\r\nfatigued by the uniform illumination.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes a relief is supplied by the phenomenon of the Aurora\r\nBorealis. We inhabitants of the United Kingdom know something of the\r\nrare beauty of the “northern lights,” when the heavens kindle with\r\na mysterious play of colours which reminds us of the strange weird\r\nradiance that occasionally kindles in our dreams; yet these are poor\r\nand trivial when compared with the auroral display. Let us endeavour\r\nto realize it from the glowing description painted by one of the most\r\neloquent and observant of Arctic explorers.\r\n\r\nHe was groping his way among the ice-hummocks, in the deep obscurity\r\nof the mid-winter, when suddenly a bright ray darted up from behind\r\nthe black cloud which lay low down on the horizon before him. It\r\nlasted but an instant, and, having filled the air with a strange\r\nillumination, it died away, leaving the darkness even greater darkness\r\nthan before. Presently an arc of coloured light sprang across the\r\nsky, and the aurora became gradually more fixed. The space enclosed\r\nby the arc was very dark, and was filled with the cloud. The play of\r\nthe rays which rose from its gradually brightening border was for some\r\ntime very capricious, modifying the burst of flame from what seemed a\r\nconflagration of the heavens to the soft glow of early morn.\r\n\r\nGradually the light grew more and more intense, and from irregular\r\nbursts it settled into an almost steady sheet of splendour. This sheet,\r\nhowever, was far from uniform, and may best be described as “a flood of\r\nmingling and variously-tinted streaks.”\r\n\r\nThe exhibition, at first tame and quiet, developed by degrees into\r\nstartling brilliancy. The broad dome of night seemed all ablaze. Lurid\r\nfires, fiercer than those which reddened the heavens from burning\r\nTroy, flashed angrily across the zenith. The stars waned before the\r\nmarvellous outburst, and seemed to recede further and further from the\r\nEarth; “as when the chariot of the sun, driven by Phaeton, and carried\r\nfrom its beaten track by the ungovernable steeds, rushed madly through\r\nthe skies, parching the world and withering the constellations. The\r\ngentle Andromeda flies trembling from the flame; Perseus, with his\r\nflashing sword and Gorgon shield, retreats in fear; the Pole-Star is\r\nchased from the night; and the Great Bear, faithful sentinel of the\r\nNorth, quits his guardian watch, following the feeble trail.”\r\n\r\nThe colour of the light was chiefly red, but this was not permanent,\r\nand every hue mingled in the wonderful display.\r\n\r\nBlue and yellow streamers shot athwart the lurid fire; and, sometimes\r\nstarting side by side from the wide expanse of the illumined arc,\r\nthey melted into each other, and flung a weird glare of green over the\r\nlandscape.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE AURORA BOREALIS.]\r\n\r\nAgain this green overcame the red; blue and yellow blended with each\r\nother in their swift flight; violet-tinted arrows flashed through a\r\nbroad glow of orange, and countless tongues of white flame, formed of\r\nthese uniting streams, rushed aloft and clasped the skies. The effect\r\nof the many-coloured lustre upon the surrounding objects was singularly\r\nwonderful. The weird forms of innumerable icebergs, singly and in\r\nclusters, loomed above the sea, and around their summits hovered the\r\nstrange gleam, like the fires of Vesuvius over the villas and temples\r\nof Pompeii. All along the white surface of the frozen sea, upon the\r\nmountain-peaks and the lofty cliffs, the light glowed and dimmed\r\nand glowed again, as if the air were filled with graveyard meteors,\r\nflitting wildly above some vast illimitable city of the dead. The scene\r\nwas noiseless, yet the senses were deceived, for sounds not of earth or\r\nsea seemed to follow the swift coruscations, and to fall upon the ear\r\nlike\r\n\r\n            “The tread\r\n      Of phantoms dread,\r\n    With banner, and spear, and flame.”\r\n\r\nThough the details, so to speak, are not always the same, the general\r\ncharacter of the aurora changes very slightly, and, from a comparison\r\nof numerous accounts, the gradation of the phenomenon would seem to be\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\nThe sky slowly assumes a tint of brown, on which, as on a background,\r\nis soon developed a nebulous segment, bordered by a spacious arc of\r\ndazzling whiteness, which seems incessantly agitated by a tremulous\r\nmotion. From this arc an incredible number of shafts and rays of light\r\nleap upwards to the zenith. These luminous columns pass through all\r\nthe hues of the rainbow,--from softest violet and intensest sapphire\r\nto green and purple-red. Sometimes the rays issue from the resplendent\r\narc mingled with darker flashes; sometimes they rise simultaneously at\r\ndifferent points of the horizon, and unite in one broad sea of flame\r\npervaded by rapid undulations. On other occasions it would seem as if\r\ninvisible hands were unfurling fiery dazzling banners, to stream, like\r\nmeteors, in the troubled air. A kind of canopy, of soft and tranquil\r\nlight, which is known as the _corona_, indicates the close of the\r\nmarvellous exhibition; and shortly after its appearance the luminous\r\nrays begin to decrease in splendour, the richly-coloured arcs dissolve\r\nand die out, and soon of all the gorgeous spectacle nothing remains but\r\na whitish cloudy haze in those parts of the firmament which, but a few\r\nminutes before, blazed with the mysterious fires of the aurora borealis.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE AURORA BOREALIS--THE CORONA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe arc of the aurora is only part of a broad circle of light, which is\r\nelevated considerably above the surface of our globe, and the centre\r\nof which is situated in the vicinity of the Pole. It is not difficult,\r\ntherefore, to account for the different aspects under which it is\r\npresented to observers placed at different angles to the focus of the\r\ndisplay. A person some degrees _south_ of the ring necessarily\r\nsees but a very small arc of it towards the north, owing to the\r\ninterposition of the earth between him and it; if he stood nearer the\r\nnorth, the arc would appear larger and higher; if immediately below\r\nit, he would see it apparently traversing the zenith; or if within\r\nthe ring, and still further north, he would see it culminating in the\r\nsouth. It has been supposed that the centre of the ring corresponds\r\nwith the magnetic north pole in the island of Boothia Felix.\r\n\r\nGenerally the phenomenon lasts for several hours, and at times it\r\nwill be varied by peculiar features. Now it will seem to present the\r\nhemispherical segment of a colossal wheel; now it will wave and droop\r\nlike a rich tapestry of many-coloured light, in a thousand prismatic\r\nfolds; and now it exhibits the array of innumerable dazzling streamers,\r\nwaving in the dark and intense sky.\r\n\r\nThe arc varies in elevation, but is seldom more than ninety miles above\r\nthe terrestrial surface. Its diameter, however, must be enormous,\r\nfor it has been known to extend southward to Italy, and has been\r\nsimultaneously visible in Sardinia, Connecticut, and at New Orleans.\r\n\r\nAccording to some authorities, the phenomenon is accompanied by noises\r\nresembling the discharge of fireworks, or the crackling of silk when\r\none piece is folded over another; but this statement is discredited by\r\nthe most trustworthy observers.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Somerville’s description is worth quoting, as taking up more\r\nemphatically some points to which we have already alluded:--\r\n\r\nThe aurora, she says, is decidedly an electrical (or, more strictly\r\nspeaking, a magneto-electrical) phenomenon. It generally appears\r\nsoon after sunset in the form of a luminous arc stretching more or\r\nless from east to west, the most elevated point being always in the\r\nmagnetic meridian of the place of the observer; across the arc the\r\ncoruscations are rapid, vivid, and of various colours, darting like\r\nlightning to the zenith, and at the same time flitting laterally with\r\nincessant velocity. The brightness of the rays varies in an instant;\r\nthey sometimes surpass the splendour of stars of the first magnitude,\r\nand often exhibit colours of admirable transparency,--blood-red at\r\nthe base, emerald-green in the middle, and clear yellow towards\r\ntheir extremity. Sometimes one, and sometimes a quick succession of\r\nluminous currents run from one end of the arc or bow to the other, so\r\nthat the rays rapidly increase in brightness; but it is impossible\r\nto say whether the coruscations themselves are actually affected by\r\na horizontal motion of translation, or whether the more vivid light\r\nis conveyed from ray to ray. The rays occasionally dart far past the\r\nzenith, vanish, suddenly reappear, and, being joined by others from the\r\narc, form a magnificent corona or immense dome of light. The segment of\r\nthe sky below the arc is quite black, as if formed by dense clouds; yet\r\nM. Struve is said to have seen stars in it, and so it would appear that\r\nthe blackness of which several observers speak must be the effect of\r\ncontrast. The lower edge of the arc is evenly defined; its upper margin\r\nis fringed by the coruscations, their convergence towards the north,\r\nand that of the arc itself, being probably an effect of perspective.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aurora exercises a remarkable influence on the magnetic needle,\r\neven in places where the display is not visible. Its vibrations seem\r\nto be slower or quicker according as the auroral light is quiescent or\r\nin motion, and the variations of the compass during the day show that\r\nthe aurora is not peculiar to night. It has been ascertained by careful\r\nobservations that the disturbances of the magnetic needle and the\r\nauroral displays were simultaneous at Toronto, in Canada, on thirteen\r\ndays out of twenty-four, the remaining days having been clouded; and\r\ncontemporaneous observations show that in these thirteen days there\r\nwere also magnetic disturbances at Prague and Tasmania; so that the\r\noccurrence of auroral phenomena at Toronto on these occasions may be\r\nviewed as a local manifestation connected with magnetic effects, which,\r\nwhatever may have been their origin, probably prevailed _on the same\r\nday over the whole surface of the globe_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the _atmospheric_ phenomena of the outer world we are\r\njustified in reckoning the Winds, which are remarkable for their\r\nvariability. Their force is considerably diminished when they pass over\r\na wide surface of ice; sometimes the ice seems even to beat back the\r\nbreeze, and turn it in a contrary direction. The warm airs from the\r\nsouth grow cool as they sweep across the frozen expanse, and give up\r\ntheir moisture in the form of snow. In a region so bleak and chill it\r\nis not often that clouds are created, the atmospheric vapours being\r\ncondensed into snow or hail without passing through any intermediate\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nWhirlwinds of frozen snow are formidable enemies to the seaman forced\r\nto traverse the ice on foot, or in a sledge drawn by Eskimo dogs. Dense\r\nshowers lash and sting the unfortunate traveller’s face, penetrate his\r\nmouth and nostrils, freeze together his very eyelids, and almost blind\r\nhim. His skin assumes a bluish tint, and burns as if scarred by the\r\nkeen thongs of a knout.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn optical illusion of frequent occurrence in the Polar Regions makes\r\nobjects appear of dimensions much larger than they really possess. A\r\nfox assumes the proportions of a bear; low banks of ice are elevated\r\ninto lofty mountains. The eye is fatigued by dwelling upon the horizon\r\nof lands which are never approached. Just as in the sandy deserts of\r\nthe Sahara the distances of real objects are apparently diminished, so\r\nthe Arctic explorer, misled by the aërial illusion, advances towards a\r\ngoal which seems always near at hand, but is never attained.\r\n\r\nAnother source of error, common both to the Arctic and the Tropical\r\ndeserts, is the mirage, a phenomenon of refraction, which represents\r\nas suspended in air the images of remote objects, and thus gives rise\r\nto the most curious illusions and fantastic scenes. Dr. Scoresby one\r\nday perceived in the air the reversed representation of a ship which he\r\nrecognized as the _Fame_, commanded by his father. He afterwards\r\ndiscovered that it had been lying moored in a creek about ten leagues\r\nfrom the point where the mirage had played with his imagination.\r\n\r\nAgain, in approaching a field of ice or snow, the traveller invariably\r\ndescries a belt of resplendent white immediately above the horizon.\r\nThis is known as the “ice-blink,” and it reveals to the Arctic\r\nnavigator beforehand the character of the ice he is approaching. At\r\ntimes, too, a range of icebergs, or of broken masses of ice, will be\r\nreflected in colossal shadows on the sky, with a strange and even weird\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, the special distinction between the Arctic lands and\r\nthe other regions of the globe is their long day and longer night.\r\nDescribing an immense spiral curve upon the horizon, the sun gradually\r\nmounts to 30°, the highest point of its course; then, in the same\r\nmanner, it returns towards the horizon, and bids farewell to the\r\nwildernesses of the North, slowly passing away behind the veil of a\r\ngloomy and ghastly twilight.\r\n\r\nWhen the navigator, says Captain Parry, finds himself for the first\r\ntime buried in the silent shadows of the Arctic night, he cannot\r\nconquer an involuntary emotion of dread; he feels transported out of\r\nthe sphere of ordinary, commonplace existence. The deadly and sombre\r\ndeserts of the Pole seem like those uncreated voids which Milton has\r\nplaced between the realms of life and death. The very animals are\r\naffected by the profound melancholy which saddens the face of Nature.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENON IN THE ARCTIC\r\n  REGIONS:--REFLECTION OF ICEBERGS.]\r\n\r\nWho can read without emotion the following passages from Dr. Kane’s\r\nJournal?--\r\n\r\n“_October 28, Friday._--The moon has reached her greatest northern\r\ndeclination of about 25° 35’. She is a glorious object; sweeping around\r\nthe heavens, at the lowest part of her curve she is still 14° above the\r\nhorizon. For eight days she has been making her circuit with nearly\r\nunvarying brightness. It is one of those sparkling nights that bring\r\nback the memory of sleigh-bells and songs and glad communings of hearts\r\nin lands that are far away.\r\n\r\n“The weather outside is at 25° below zero.”\r\n\r\nA few days later, and the heroic explorer writes:--\r\n\r\n“_November 7, Monday._--The darkness is coming on with insidious\r\nsteadiness, and its advances can be perceived only by comparing one\r\nday with its fellow of some time back. We still read the thermometer\r\nat noonday without a light, and the black masses of the hills are\r\nplain for about five hours with their glaring patches of snow; but all\r\nthe rest is darkness. Lanterns are always on the spar-deck, and the\r\nlard-lamps never extinguished below. The stars of the sixth magnitude\r\nshine out at noonday.\r\n\r\n“Our darkness has ninety days to run before we shall get back again\r\neven to the contested twilight of to-day. Altogether, our winter will\r\nhave been sunless for one hundred and forty days.”\r\n\r\nHere is another significant passage; yet all its significance can\r\nscarcely be appreciated by the dwellers in temperate climes:--\r\n\r\n“_November 27, Sunday._--The thermometer was in the neighbourhood\r\nof 40° _below zero_, and the day was too dark to read at noon.”\r\n\r\n“_December 15, Thursday._--We have lost the last vestige of our\r\nmid-day twilight. We cannot see print, and hardly paper: the fingers\r\ncannot be counted a foot from the eyes. Noonday and midnight are alike;\r\nand, except a vague glimmer on the sky that seems to define the hill\r\noutlines to the south, we have nothing to tell us that this Arctic\r\nworld of ours has a sun.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of January (1854), Dr. Kane’s thermometer stood at 49°\r\nbelow zero; and on the 20th the range of those at the observatory\r\nwas at -64° to -67°. On the 5th of February they began to show an\r\nunexampled temperature. They ranged from 60° to 75° below zero, and one\r\nvery admirable instrument on the taffrail of the brig stood at -65°.\r\nThe reduced mean of the best spirit-standards gave -67°, or 97° below\r\nthe freezing-point of water.\r\n\r\nAt these temperatures chloric ether became solid, and carefully\r\nprepared chloroform exhibited a granular film or pellicle on its\r\nsurface. Spirit of naphtha froze at -54°, and oil of sassafras at -49°.\r\nThe oil of winter-green assumes a flocculent appearance at -56°, and\r\nsolid at -63° and -65°.\r\n\r\nSome further details, borrowed from Dr. Kane’s experiences, will\r\nillustrate still more powerfully the singular atmospheric conditions of\r\nthe Arctic winter.\r\n\r\nThe exhalations from the surface of the body invested any exposed or\r\npartially-clad part with a wreath of vapour. The air had a perceptible\r\npungency when inspired, but Dr. Kane did not undergo the painful\r\nsensation described by some Siberian travellers. When breathed for any\r\nlength of time it imparted a sensation of dryness to the air-passages;\r\nand Dr. Kane observed that all his party, as it were involuntarily,\r\nbreathed gradually, and with compressed lips.\r\n\r\nIt was at noon on the 21st of January that the first glimmer of\r\nreturning light became visible, the southern horizon being touched\r\nfor a short time with a distinct orange hue. The sun had, perhaps,\r\nafforded them a kind of illumination before, but if so, it was not to\r\nbe distinguished from the “cold light of stars.” They had been nearing\r\nthe sunshine for thirty-two days, and had just reached that degree of\r\nmitigated darkness which made the extreme midnight of Sir Edward Parry\r\nin lat. 74° 47’.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already alluded to the depressing influence exercised by\r\nthe prolonged and intense darkness of the Arctic night, and we have\r\nreferred to the singular effect it has upon animals. Dr. Kane’s dogs,\r\nthough most of them were natives of the Arctic Circle, proved unable\r\nto bear up against it. Most of them died from an anomalous form of\r\ndisease, to which the absence of light would seem to have contributed\r\nas much as the extreme cold. This circumstance seems worthy of fuller\r\nnotice, and we quote, therefore, Dr. Kane’s observation upon it:--\r\n\r\n“_January 20._--This morning at five o’clock--for I am so\r\nafflicted with the _insomnium_ of this eternal night, that I\r\nrise at any time between midnight and noon--I went upon deck. It was\r\nabsolutely dark, the cold not permitting a swinging lamp. There was not\r\na glimmer came to me through the ice-crusted window-panes of the cabin.\r\nWhile I was feeling my way, half puzzled as to the best method of\r\nsteering clear of whatever might be before me, two of my Newfoundland\r\ndogs put their cold noses against my hand, and instantly commenced\r\nthe most exuberant antics of satisfaction. It then occurred to me how\r\nvery dreary and forlorn must these poor animals be, at atmospheres\r\n+10° in-doors and -50° without,--living in darkness, howling at an\r\naccidental light, as if it reminded them of the moon,--and with\r\nnothing, either of instinct or sensation, to tell them of the passing\r\nhours, or to explain the long-lost daylight.”\r\n\r\nThe effect of the prolonged darkness upon these animals was most\r\nextraordinary. Every attention was paid to their wants; they were kept\r\nbelow, tended, fed, cleansed, caressed, and _doctored_; still they\r\ngrew worse and worse. Strange to say, their disease was as clearly\r\n_mental_ as in the case of any human being. There was no physical\r\ndisorganization; they ate voraciously; they slept soundly, they\r\nretained their strength. But first they were stricken by epilepsy, and\r\nthis was followed by true lunacy. They barked frenziedly at nothing;\r\nthey walked in straight and curved lines with anxious and unwearying\r\nperseverance. They fawned on the seamen, but without seeming to\r\nappreciate any caresses bestowed upon them; pushing their head against\r\nthe friend who noticed them, or oscillating with a strange pantomime of\r\nfear. Their most intelligent actions seemed of an automatic character;\r\nsometimes they clawed at their masters, as if seeking to burrow into\r\ntheir seal-skins; sometimes they preserved for hours a moody silence,\r\nand then started off howling, as if pursued, and ran to and fro for a\r\nconsiderable period.\r\n\r\nWhen spring returned Dr. Kane had to mourn the loss of nine splendid\r\nNewfoundland and thirty-five Eskimo dogs; of the whole pack only six\r\nsurvived, and one of these was unfit for draught.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving dwelt at some length on the characteristics of the Arctic\r\nwinter, we now turn to consider those of the Arctic spring. This\r\nbegins in April, but does not exhibit itself in all the freshness of\r\nits beauty until May. The temperature rises daily in the interval; the\r\nwinter fall of snow, which has so long shrouded the gaunt hills and\r\nlain upon the valleys, rolls up before the rays of the rising sun;\r\nand the melted snow pours in noisy torrents and flashing cascades\r\nthrough the rugged ravines and over the dark sides of the lofty cliffs:\r\neverywhere the air resounds with the din of falling waters. Early in\r\nJune the traveller sees with delight the signs of returning vegetation.\r\nThe willow-stems grow green with the fresh and living sap; mosses,\r\nand poppies, and saxifrages, and the cochlearia, with other hardy\r\nplants, begin to sprout; the welcome whirr of wings is brought upon the\r\nbreeze; the cliffs are alive with the little auks; flocks of stately\r\neider-ducks sail into the creeks and sounds; the graceful terns scream\r\nand dart over the sea; the burgomasters and the gyrfalcons move to and\r\nfro with greater dignity; the long-tailed duck fills the echoes with\r\nits shrill voice; the snipes hover about the fresh-water pools; the\r\nsparrows chirp from rock to rock; long lines of cackling geese sail in\r\nthe blue clearness overhead on their way to a remoter north; the walrus\r\nand the seal bask on the ice-floes which have broken up into small\r\nrafts, and drift lazily with the currents; and a fleet of icebergs move\r\nsouthwards in solemn and stately procession, their spires and towers\r\nflashing and coruscating in the sunlight.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ADVENT OF SPRING IN THE POLAR REGIONS.]\r\n\r\nWe transcribe a sketch of a spring landscape in the Polar world from\r\nthe pages of Dr. Hayes:--\r\n\r\nWe arrived at the lake, he says, in the midst of a very enlivening\r\nscene. The snow had mainly disappeared from the valley, and, although\r\nno flowers had yet appeared, the early vegetation was covering the\r\nbanks with green, and the feeble growths opened their little leaves\r\nalmost under the very snow, and stood alive and fresh in the frozen\r\nturf, looking as glad of the spring as their more ambitious cousins of\r\nthe warm South. Numerous small herds of reindeer had come down from the\r\nmountains to fatten on this newly budding life. Gushing rivulets and\r\nfantastic waterfalls mingled their pleasant music with the ceaseless\r\nhum of birds, myriads of which sat upon the rocks of the hill-side,\r\nor were perched upon the cliffs, or sailed through the air in swarms\r\nso thick that they seemed like a dark cloud passing before the sun.\r\nThese birds were the little auk, a water-fowl not larger than a quail.\r\nThe swift flutter of their wings and their constant cry filled the air\r\nwith a roar like that of a storm advancing among the forest trees.\r\nThe valley was glowing with the sunlight of the early morning, which\r\nstreamed in over the glacier, and robed hill, mountain, and plain in\r\nbrightness.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpring passes into summer, and all nature seems endowed with a new\r\nlife. The death-like silence, the oppressive darkness, the sense of\r\nfear and despondency, all have passed away; and earth and water echo\r\nwith cheerful voices, the landscape is bathed in a glorious radiance,\r\nthe human soul is conscious of a sentiment of hope and expectation. The\r\nwinter is past and gone; the flowers appear on the earth; the time of\r\nthe singing of birds is come. The snow has melted from the hills, and\r\nthe streams run with a merry music, and the scanty flora of the far\r\nnorthern world attains its full development. By day and night the sun\r\npours forth its invigorating rays, and even the butterfly is encouraged\r\nto sport among the blossoms. The Aurora no longer exhibits its\r\nmany-coloured fires, and the sky is as clear and cloudless as in genial\r\nItaly. But this season of life and warmth is of short duration, and\r\nwhen July has passed the sun begins to sink lower and lower, as if to\r\nvisit another world; a shadow gradually steals over the sky; winds blow\r\nfiercely, and bring with them blinding showers of sleet and icicles;\r\nthe fountains and the streams cease their pleasant flow; the broad\r\ncrust of ice spreads over the imprisoned sea; the snow-mantle rests on\r\nthe hill-sides and the valleys; the birds wing their way to the warmer\r\nSouth; and the Polar world is once more given over to the silence, the\r\nloneliness, and the gloom of the long Arctic night.\r\n\r\n\r\nTurning our attention now to the “starry heavens,” we observe that\r\nconspicuous among the glorious host is the North Star, which, from\r\nearliest times, has been the friend and guide of the navigator.\r\n\r\nThe Pole-Star, or Polaris, is the star α in the constellation of\r\n_Ursa Minor_, and is the nearest large star to the north pole\r\nof the celestial equator. We say the “nearest,” because it does not\r\nactually mark the position of the pole, but is about 1° 30’ from it.\r\nOwing, however, to the motion of the pole of the celestial equator\r\nround that of the ecliptic, it will, in about 2000 A.D.,\r\napproach within 28’ of the north pole; but after reaching this point\r\nof approximation it will begin to recede. At the time of Hipparchus it\r\nwas 12° distant from it (that is, in 156 B.C.); in 1785, 2°\r\n2’. You may easily find its place in the “stellar firmament,” for a\r\nline drawn between the stars α and β (hence called the “Pointers”) of\r\nthe constellation _Ursa Major_, or the Great Bear, and produced in\r\na northerly direction for about four and a half times its own length,\r\nwill almost touch the Pole-Star. Two thousand years this post of\r\nhonour, so to speak, was occupied by the star β of _Ursa Major_;\r\nwhile, in about twelve thousand years, it will be occupied by the star\r\nVega in _Lyra_, which will be within 5° of the north pole.\r\n\r\nThe constellation of _Ursa Major_ is always above the horizon of\r\nEurope, and hence it has been an object of curiosity to its inhabitants\r\nfrom the remotest antiquity. Our readers may easily recognize it by\r\nthree stars which form a triangle in its tail, while four more form\r\na quadrangle in the body of the imaginary bear. In the triangle,\r\nthe first star at the tip of the tail is Benetnasch of the second\r\nmagnitude; the second, Mizar; and the third, Alioth. In the quadrangle,\r\nthe first star at the root of the tail is named Megrez; the second\r\nbelow it, Phad; the third, in a horizontal direction, Merak; and the\r\nfourth, above the latter, Dubhe, of the first magnitude.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: URSA MAJOR AND URSA MINOR.]\r\n\r\nIn _Ursa Minor_ the only conspicuous star is Polaris, of which we\r\nhave recently spoken.\r\n\r\nWe subjoin a list of the northern constellations, including the names\r\nof those who formed them, the number of their visible stars, and the\r\nnames of the most important and conspicuous.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NORTHERN CONSTELLATIONS.\r\n\r\n +----------------------------------|-----------+--------+----------------------+\r\n |      CONSTELLATIONS.             | AUTHOR.   | NO.

It has borne\r\ndifferent names, at different times, and among different peoples.\r\nIt was the Ἄρκτος μεγάλη of the Greeks; the “Septem triones” of the\r\nLatins. It is known in some parts as David’s Chariot; the Chinese call\r\nit, _Tcheou-pey_.\r\n\r\nNight and day this constellation watches above the northern horizon,\r\nrevolving, with slow and majestic march, around Polaris, in four\r\nand twenty hours. The quadrangle of stars in the body of the Great\r\nBear forms the wheels of the chariot; the triangle in its tail, the\r\nchariot-pole. Above the second of the three latter shines the small\r\nstar Alcor, also named the Horseman. The Arabs call it Saidak, or “the\r\nTest,” because they use it to try the range and strength of a person’s\r\nvision.\r\n\r\nThis brilliant northern constellation, composed, with the exception of\r\nδ, of stars of the second magnitude, has frequently been celebrated by\r\npoets. We may paraphrase, for the advantage of our readers, a glowing\r\napostrophe from the pen of the American Ware:--\r\n\r\nWith what grand and majestic steps, he says, it moves forward in its\r\neternal circle, following among the stars its regal way in a slow\r\nand silent splendour! Mighty creation, I salute thee! I love to see\r\nthee wandering in the shining paths like a giant proud of his strong\r\ngirdle--severe, indefatigable, resolved--whose feet never lag in the\r\nroad which lies before them. Other tribes abandon their nocturnal\r\ncourse and rest their weary orbs under the waves; but thou, thou\r\nnever closest thy burning eyes, and never suspendest thy determined\r\nsteps. Forward, ever forward! While systems change, and suns retire,\r\nand worlds fall to sleep and awake again, thou pursuest thy endless\r\nmarch. The near horizon attempts to check thee, but in vain. A watchful\r\nsentinel, thou never quittest thy age-long duty; but, without allowing\r\nthyself to be surprised by sleep, thou guardest the fixed light of the\r\nuniverse, and preventest the north from ever forgetting its place.\r\n\r\nSeven stars dwell in that shining company; the eye embraces them all\r\nat a single glance; their distances from one another, however, are\r\nnot less than the distance of each from Earth. And this again is the\r\nreciprocal distance of the celestial centres or foci. From depths of\r\nheaven, unexplored by thought, the piercing rays dart across the void,\r\nrevealing to our senses innumerable worlds and systems. Let us arm\r\nour vision with the telescope, and let us survey the firmament. The\r\nskies open wide; a shower of sparkling fires descends upon our head;\r\nthe stars close up their ranks, are condensed in regions so remote\r\nthat their swift rays (swifter than aught else in creation) must\r\ntravel for centuries before they can reach our Earth. Earth, sun, and\r\nye constellations, what are ye among this infinite immensity and the\r\nmultitude of the Divine works!\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we face towards the Pole-Star, which, as we have seen, preserves\r\nits place in the centre of the northern region of the sky, we have the\r\nsouth behind us, the east is on our right, the west upon our left. All\r\nthe stars revolving round the Pole-Star, from right to left, should be\r\nrecognized according to their mutual relations rather than referred\r\nto the cardinal points. On the other side of Polaris, as compared\r\nwith the Great Bear, we find another constellation which is easily\r\nrecognized. If from the central star δ we carry a line to the Pole, and\r\nthen prolong it for an equal distance, we traverse the constellation\r\nof _Cassiopeia_, composed of five stars of the third magnitude,\r\ndisposed somewhat like the outer jambs of the letter M. The small star\r\nχ, terminating the square, gives it also the form of a chair. This\r\ngroup occupies every possible situation in revolving round the Pole,\r\nbeing at one time above it, at another below, now on the left, and then\r\non the right; but it is always readily found, because, like _Ursa\r\nMajor_, to which it is invariably opposite, it never sets. The\r\nPole-Star is the axle round which these two constellations revolve.\r\n\r\nIf we now draw, from the stars α and δ in _Ursa Major_, two\r\nlines meeting at the Pole, and afterwards extend them beyond\r\n_Cassiopeia_, they will abut on the square of _Pegasus_,\r\nwhich is bounded on one of its sides by a group, or series, of three\r\nstars resembling the triangle in _Ursa Major_. These three belong\r\nto the constellation of _Andromeda_ (α, β, and γ), and themselves\r\nabut on another three-orbed group, that of _Perseus_.\r\n\r\nThe last star in the square of _Perseus_ is also the first α of\r\n_Andromeda_: the other three are named, Algenib, γ; Markab, α;\r\nand Scheat, β. To the north of _Andromeda_ β, and near a small\r\nstar, ν, the Arctic traveller will discern an oblong nebula, which\r\nmay be compared to the light of a taper seen through a sheet of horn;\r\nthis is the first nebula to which any allusion occurs in the annals\r\nof astronomy. In _Perseus_ α, an orb of great brilliancy, on the\r\nprolonged plane of the three principal stars of _Andromeda_,\r\nshines with steady lustre between two less dazzling spheres, and forms\r\nin conjunction with them a concave arc very easily distinguished.\r\nOf this arc we may avail ourselves as a new point of departure. By\r\nprolonging it in the direction of δ, we come to a very bright star of\r\nthe first magnitude, the _Goat_. By forming a right angle to this\r\nprolongation in a southerly direction we come to that glorious mass of\r\nstars, not very frequently above the Polar horizon, the _Pleiads_.\r\nThese were held in evil repute among the ancients. Their appearance was\r\nsupposed to be ominous of violent storms, and Valerius Flaccus speaks\r\nof them as fatal to ships.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: NEBULA IN ANDROMEDA.]\r\n\r\nAlgol, or Medusa’s Head, known to astronomers as Perseus β, belongs\r\nto the singular class of Variable Stars. Instead of shining with a\r\nconstant lustre, like other orbs, it is sometimes very brilliant,\r\nand sometimes very pale; passing, apparently, from the second to the\r\nfourth magnitude. According to Goodricke, its period of variation is 2\r\ndays 20 hours 48 minutes. This phenomenal character was first observed\r\nby Maraldi in 1694; but the duration of the change was determined by\r\nGoodricke in 1782. For two days and fourteen hours it continues at\r\nits brightest, and shines a glory in the heavens. Then its lustre\r\nsuddenly begins to wane, and in three hours and a half is reduced to\r\nits minimum. Its weakest period, however, does not last more than about\r\nfifteen minutes. It then begins to increase in brightness, and in\r\nthree hours and a half more it is restored to its full splendour; thus\r\npassing through its succession of changes in 2 days 20 hours 48 minutes.\r\n\r\nThis singular periodicity suggested to Goodricke the idea of some\r\nopaque body revolving around the star, and by interposing between it\r\nand the Earth cutting off a portion of its light. Algol is one of the\r\nmost interesting of the welcome stars which kindle in the long Arctic\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nThe star ζ in _Perseus_, situated above the “stormy Pleiads,” is\r\ndouble; that is, a binary star. ξ in Ursa Major is also a twin-star;\r\nand so is Polaris, the second and smaller star appearing a mere speck\r\nin comparison with its companion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese are the principal stars and starry groups in the Circumpolar\r\nRegions of the heavens, on one side; let us now turn our attention to\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose we must again take the Great Bear as our\r\nstarting-point. Prolonging the tail in its curvature, the Arctic\r\ntraveller notes, at some distance from it, a star of the first\r\nmagnitude, Arcturus, or Boötes α. This star, though without any\r\nauthority, was at one time considered the nearest to the Earth of all\r\nthe starry host. About 10° to the north-east of it is Mirac, or ε\r\nBoötes; one of the most beautiful objects in the heavens, on account of\r\nthe contrasted hues, yellow and azure, of the two stars composing it.\r\nUnfortunately, the twin-orbs cannot be distinctly seen except with a\r\ntelescope of two hundred magnifying power.\r\n\r\nA small ring of stars to the left of Boötes is appropriately known as\r\n_Corona Borealis_, or the Northern Crown.\r\n\r\nThe constellation of _Boötes_ forms a pentagon; and the stars\r\ncomposing it are all of the third magnitude, with the exception of\r\nα, which is of the first. Arcturus, as we have said, was anciently\r\nconsidered the star nearest to the Earth. It is, at all events,\r\n_one_ of the nearest, and belongs to the small number of those\r\nwhose distance our astronomers have succeeded in calculating. It is 61\r\ntrillions, 712,000 millions of leagues from our planet; a distance of\r\nwhich we can form no appreciable conception. Moreover, it is a coloured\r\nstar; on examining it through a telescope we see that it is of the same\r\nhue as the “red planet Mars.”\r\n\r\nBy carrying a line from the Polar Star to Arcturus, and raising\r\na perpendicular in the middle of this line, opposite to _Ursa\r\nMajor_, the observer of the Arctic skies will discover one of the\r\nmost luminous orbs of night, _Vega_, or α Lyra, near the Milky\r\nWay. The star β Lyra, or Sheliak, is a variable star, changing from\r\nthe third to the fifth magnitude, and accomplishing its variation in 6\r\ndays 10 hours and 34 minutes. β and ε Lyra are quadruple systems, each\r\ncomposed of binary or twin-stars.\r\n\r\nThe line drawn from Arcturus to Vega cuts the constellation of Hercules.\r\n\r\nBetween Ursa Major and Ursa Minor may be observed a prolonged series\r\nof small stars, coiling, as it were, in a number of convolutions,\r\nand extending towards Vega: these belong to the constellation of the\r\n_Dragon_.\r\n\r\nSuch are the principal objects which attract the attention of the\r\ntraveller, when contemplating the star-studded firmament of the Arctic\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n     THE POLAR SEAS: ICEBERGS--ICE-FLOES--THE SEAL--THE WALRUS THE\r\n           NARWHAL--THE WHALE--SUNDRY FORMS OF MARINE LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose masses of ice which, towering to a considerable elevation\r\nabove the surface of the water, are carried hither and thither by\r\nthe currents of the Polar Sea, are known as _Icebergs_. They\r\nare fresh-water formations, originating in the great glaciers of the\r\nnorthern highlands. For as the rivers continuously pour their waters\r\ninto the ocean, so do the glaciers incessantly glide downward from the\r\nhead of the valleys which they occupy, until, arriving on the coast,\r\nthey throw off their terminal projections, to be carried afar by the\r\naction of the tidal waves.\r\n\r\nThese bergs, or floating mountains, are sometimes 250 to 300 feet above\r\nthe level of the sea, and their capacity or bulk is invariably equal\r\nto their height. From their specific gravity it has been calculated\r\nthat the volume of an iceberg _below_ the water is eight times\r\nthat of the portion rising above it. They are frequently of the most\r\nimposing magnitude. Ross, in his first expedition, fell in with one\r\nin Baffin Bay, at a distance of seven leagues from land, which had\r\ngone aground in sixty-one fathoms water. Its dimensions, according to\r\nLieutenant Parry, were 4,169 yards in length, 3,869 yards in breadth,\r\nand 51 feet in height. Its configuration is described as resembling\r\nthat of the back of the Isle of Wight, while its cliffs recalled those\r\nchalky ramparts which stretch their glittering line to the west of\r\nDover. Its weight was computed at 1,292,397,673 tons. Captain Graab\r\nexamined a mass, on the west coast of Greenland, which rose 120 feet\r\nout of the water, measured 4,000 feet in circumference at the base,\r\nand was calculated to be equal in bulk to upwards of 900,000,000 cubic\r\nfeet. Dr. Hayes took the measurements of a berg which had stranded off\r\nthe little harbour of Tessuissak, to the north of Melville Bay. The\r\nsquare wall which faced towards his base of triangulation was somewhat\r\nmore than three-quarters of a mile in length, and 315 feet in height.\r\nAs it was nearly square-sided above the sea, it would be of the same\r\nshape beneath it; and, according to the ratio already given, must have\r\ndrifted aground in a depth of fully half a mile. In other words, from\r\nbase to summit it must have stood as high as the peak of Snowdon. Its\r\ncubical contents cannot have been less than about 27,000,000,000 feet,\r\nnor its weight than 2,000,000,000 tons!\r\n\r\nWhen seen from a distance, the spectacle of any considerable number\r\nof these slowly-moving mountains is very impressive, and it becomes\r\nparticularly magnificent if it should be lit up by the splendour of\r\nthe midnight sun. They are not only majestic in size, but sublime in\r\nappearance, at one time assuming the likeness of a grand cathedral\r\nchurch, at another, of a lofty obelisk; now of a dazzling pyramid, and\r\nnow of a cluster of lofty towers. Nature would seem to have lavished\r\nupon them all her architectural fancy; and as they are grandly swept\r\nalong, one might be pardoned for supposing them to be the sea-washed\r\npalaces of a race of ocean Titans.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ARCHED ICEBERG OFF THE GREENLAND COAST.]\r\n\r\nIn Melville Bay, Dr. Kane’s ship anchored to an iceberg, which\r\nprotected it from the fury of a violent gale. But he had not long\r\nenjoyed the tranquil shelter it afforded, when a din of loud crackling\r\nsounds was heard above; and small fragments of ice, not larger\r\nthan a walnut, began to dot the water, like the first big drops\r\nof a thunder-shower. Dr. Kane and his crew did not neglect these\r\nindications; they had barely time to cast off, however, before the face\r\nof the icy cliff fell in ruins, crashing like near artillery.\r\n\r\nAfterwards he made fast to a larger berg, which he describes as a\r\nmoving breakwater, and of gigantic proportions; it kept its course\r\nsteadily towards the north.\r\n\r\nWhen he got under weigh, and made for the north-east, through a\r\nlabyrinth of ice-floes, he was favoured with a gorgeous spectacle,\r\nwhich hardly any excitement of peril could have induced him to\r\noverlook. The midnight sun came out over the northern crest of the huge\r\nberg, kindling variously-coloured fires on every part of its surface,\r\nand making the ice around one sublime transparency of illuminated\r\ngem-work, blazing carbuncles, and rubies and molten gold.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: AMONG THE BERGS--A NARROW ESCAPE.]\r\n\r\nDr. Hayes describes an immense berg which resembled in its general\r\naspect the Westminster Palace of Sir Charles Barry’s creation. It went\r\nto ruin before his eyes. First one tall tower tumbled headlong into\r\nthe water, starting from its surface an innumerable swarm of gulls;\r\nthen another followed; and at length, after five hours of terrible\r\ndisruption and crashing, not a fragment that rose fifty feet above the\r\nwater remained of this architectural colossus of ice.\r\n\r\nThese floating isles of ice are carried southward fully two thousand\r\nmiles from their parent glaciers to melt in the Atlantic, where they\r\ncommunicate a perceptible coldness to the water for thirty or forty\r\nmiles around, while their influence on the atmospheric temperature may\r\nbe recognized at a greater distance. Their number is extraordinary. As\r\nmany as seven hundred bergs, each loftier than the dome of St. Paul’s,\r\nsome than the cross of St. Peter’s, have been seen at once in the\r\nPolar basin; as if the Frost King had despatched an armada to oppose\r\nthe rash enterprise of man in penetrating within his dominions. The\r\nwaves break against them as against an iron-bound coast, and often the\r\nspray is flung over their very summits, like the spray of the rolling\r\nwaters of the Channel over the crest of the Eddystone Lighthouse. The\r\nice crumbles from their face, and tumbles down into the sea with a roar\r\nlike that of artillery; and as they waste away, through the combined\r\naction of air and water, they occasionally lose their equilibrium and\r\ntopple over, producing a swell and a violent commotion which break\r\nup the neighbouring ice-fields: the tumult spreads far and wide, and\r\nthunder seems to peal around.\r\n\r\nThe fractures or rents frequently visible in the glittering cliffs\r\nof the icebergs are of an emerald green, and look like patches of\r\nbeautiful fresh sward on cliffs of chalk; while pools of water of the\r\nmost exquisite sapphirine blue shine resplendent on their surface, or\r\nleap down their craggy sides in luminous cascades. Even in the night\r\nthey are readily distinguished from afar by their effulgence; and in\r\nfoggy, hazy weather, by a peculiar blackness in the atmosphere. As the\r\nGreenland Current frequently drifts them to the south of Newfoundland,\r\nand even to the 40th or 39th parallel of latitude, the ships and\r\nsteamers crossing between Europe and America sometimes meet them on\r\ntheir track. To come into collision with them is certain destruction;\r\nand it is probable that some of those ill-fated vessels which have left\r\ntheir harbours in safety, but have never since been heard of,--as, for\r\nexample, the steamer _President_,--have perished through this\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nBut if they are sometimes dangerous to the mariner, they often prove\r\nhis security. As most of their bulk lies below the water-surface, they\r\nare either carried along by under-currents against the wind, or else\r\nfrom their colossal size they are able to defy the strongest gale, and\r\nto move along with majestic slowness when every other kind of ice is\r\ndriven swiftly past them. And hence it happens that, when the wind is\r\ncontrary, the whaler is glad to bring his ship into smooth water under\r\ntheir lee. In describing the difficulties of his passage through the\r\nloose and drifting ice near Cape York, and the broken ice-fields, Dr.\r\nKane records the assistance he derived from the large icebergs, to\r\nwhich he moored his vessel, and thus was enabled, he says, to hold his\r\nown, however rapidly the surface-floes were passing by him to the south.\r\n\r\nYet anchoring to a berg brings with it an occasional peril. As we have\r\nalready said, large pieces frequently loosen themselves from the summit\r\nor sides, and fall into the sea with a far-resounding crash. When\r\nthis operation, “calving,” as it is called, takes place, woe to the\r\nunfortunate ship which lies beneath!\r\n\r\nAll ice becomes excessively brittle under the influence of the sun or\r\nof a temperate atmosphere, and a single blow from an axe will suffice\r\nto split a huge berg asunder, burying the heedless adventurer beneath\r\nthe ruins, or hurling him into the yawning chasm.\r\n\r\nDr. Scoresby records the adventure of two sailors who had been sent to\r\nattach an anchor to a berg. They set to work to hew a hole in the ice,\r\nbut scarcely had the first blow been struck, when the colossal mass\r\nrent from top to bottom and fell asunder, the two halves falling in\r\nopposite directions with a tremendous uproar. One of the sailors, with\r\nremarkable presence of mind, instantly clambered up the huge fragment\r\non which he was sitting, and remained rocking to and fro on the dizzy\r\nsummit until its equilibrium was restored; the other, falling between\r\nthe masses, would probably have been crushed to death if the current\r\ncaused by their commotion had not swept him within reach of the boat\r\nthat was waiting for them.\r\n\r\nFastening to a berg, says Sherard Osborn, has its risks and dangers.\r\nSometimes the first stroke of the man setting the ice-anchor, by its\r\nconcussion, causes the iceberg to break up, and the people so employed\r\nrun great risk of being injured; at another time, vessels obliged to\r\nmake fast under the steep side of a berg have been seriously damaged by\r\npieces detaching themselves from overhead; and, again, the projecting\r\nmasses, called tongues, which form under water the base of the berg,\r\nhave been known to break off, and strike a vessel so severely as to\r\nsink her. All these perils are duly detailed by every Arctic navigator,\r\nwho is always mindful, in mooring to an iceberg, to look for a side\r\nwhich is low and sloping, without any tongues under water.\r\n\r\nCaptain Parry was once witness of that sublime spectacle, which, though\r\nof frequent occurrence, is seldom seen by human eyes, the entire\r\ndissolution of an enormous iceberg.\r\n\r\nIts huge size and massiveness had been specially remarked, and men\r\nthought that it might well resist “a century of sun and thaw.” It\r\nlooked as large as Westminster Abbey. All on board Captain Parry’s\r\nship described as a most wonderful spectacle this iceberg, without any\r\nwarning, completely breaking up. The sea around it became a seething\r\ncaldron, from the violent plunging of the masses, as they broke and\r\nre-broke in a thousand pieces. The floes, torn up for a distance of\r\ntwo miles around it, by the violent action of the rolling waters,\r\nthreatened, from the agitation of the ice, to destroy any vessel that\r\nhad been amongst them; and Captain Parry and his crew congratulated\r\nthemselves that they were sufficiently far from the scene to witness\r\nits sublimity without being involved in its danger.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ICEBERG AND ICE-FIELD, MELVILLE BAY, GREENLAND]\r\n\r\nIcebergs chiefly abound in Baffin Bay, and in the gulfs and inlets\r\nconnected with it. They are particularly numerous in the great\r\nindentation known as Melville Bay, the whole interior of the country\r\nbordering upon it being the seat of immense glaciers, and these are\r\nconstantly “shedding off” icebergs of the largest dimensions. The\r\ngreater bulk of these is, as we have explained, below the water-line;\r\nand the consequent depth to which they sink when floating subjects them\r\nto the action of the deeper ocean-currents, while their broad surface\r\nabove the water is, of course, acted on by the wind. It happens,\r\ntherefore, as Dr. Kane remarks, that they are found not infrequently\r\nmoving in different directions from the floes around them, and\r\npreventing them for a time from freezing into a united mass. Still,\r\nin the late winter, when the cold has thoroughly set in, Melville\r\nBay becomes a continuous mass of ice, from Cape York to the Devil’s\r\nThumb. At other times, this region justifies the name the whalers have\r\nbestowed upon it of “Bergy Hole.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Beechey, in his voyage with Buchan, in 1818, had an opportunity\r\nof witnessing the formation of a “berg,” or rather of two of these\r\nimmense masses. In Magdalena Bay he had taken the ship’s launch near\r\nthe shore to examine a magnificent glacier, when the discharge of a\r\ngun caused an instantaneous disruption of its bulk. A noise resembling\r\nthunder was heard in the direction of the glacier, and in a few seconds\r\nmore an immense piece broke away, and fell headlong into the sea.\r\nThe crew of the launch, supposing themselves beyond the reach of its\r\ninfluence, quietly looked upon the scene, when a sea arose and rolled\r\ntowards the shore with such rapidity that the boat was washed upon the\r\nbeach and filled. As soon as their astonishment had subsided, they\r\nexamined the boat, and found her so badly stove that it was necessary\r\nto repair her before they could return to their ship. They had also\r\nthe curiosity to measure the distance the boat had been carried by the\r\nwave, and ascertained that it was ninety-six feet.\r\n\r\nA short time afterwards, when Captain Beechey and Lieutenant Franklin\r\nhad approached one of these stupendous walls of ice, and were\r\nendeavouring to search into the innermost recess of a deep cavern that\r\nlay near the foot of the glacier, they suddenly heard a report, as of\r\na cannon, and turning to the quarter whence it proceeded, perceived\r\nan immense section of the front of the glacier sliding down from the\r\nheight of two hundred feet at least into the sea, and dispersing the\r\nwater in every direction, accompanied by a loud grinding noise, and\r\nfollowed by an outflow of water, which, being previously lodged in the\r\nfissures, now made its escape in innumerable tiny flashing rills and\r\ncataracts.\r\n\r\nThe mass thus disengaged at first disappeared wholly under water, and\r\nnothing could be seen but a violent seething of the sea, and the ascent\r\nof clouds of glittering spray, such as that which occurs at the foot of\r\na great waterfall. But after a short time it reappeared, raising its\r\nhead fully a hundred feet above the surface, with water streaming down\r\non every side; and then labouring, as if doubtful which way it should\r\nfall, it rolled over, rocked to and fro for a few minutes, and finally\r\nbecame settled.\r\n\r\nOn approaching and measuring it, Beechey found it to be nearly a\r\nquarter of a mile in circumference, and sixty feet out of the water.\r\nKnowing its specific gravity, and making a fair allowance for its\r\ninequalities, he computed its weight at 421,660 tons.\r\n\r\nIn Parry’s first voyage he passed in one day fifty icebergs of large\r\ndimensions, just after crossing the Arctic Circle; and on the following\r\nday a still more extended chain of ice-peaks of still larger size,\r\nagainst which a heavy southerly swell was violently driven, dashing the\r\nloose ice with tremendous force, sometimes flinging a white spray over\r\nthem to the height of more than one hundred feet, and accompanied by a\r\nloud noise “exactly resembling the roar of distant thunder.”\r\n\r\nBetween one of these bergs and a detached floe the _Hecla_,\r\nParry’s ship, had nearly, as the whalers say, been “nipped,” or\r\ncrushed. The berg was about one hundred and forty feet high, and\r\naground in one hundred and twenty fathoms, so that its whole height\r\nmust have exceeded eight hundred feet; that is, it was of a bulk equal\r\nto St. Catherine’s Down in the Isle of Wight.\r\n\r\nIn his second voyage Parry speaks of fifty-four icebergs visible at one\r\ntime, some of which were not less than two hundred feet above the sea;\r\nand again of thirty of these huge masses, many of them whirled about by\r\nthe tides like straws on a mill-stream.\r\n\r\nIcebergs can originate only in regions where glaciers abound: the\r\nformer are the offspring of the latter, and where land unsuitable to\r\nthe production of the latter does not exist, the former are never\r\nfound. Hence, in Baffin Bay, where steep cliffs of cold granite frown\r\nover almost fathomless waters, the “monarch of glacial formations”\r\nfloats slowly from the ravine which has been its birthplace, until\r\nfairly launched into the depths of ocean, and, “after long years,”\r\ndrifts into the warmer regions of the Atlantic to assist in the\r\npreservation of Nature’s laws of equilibrium of temperature of the air\r\nand water.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when men of science, and, amongst others, the French\r\nphilosopher St. Pierre, believed that icebergs were the snow and ice\r\nof ages accumulated upon an Arctic sea, which, forming at the Poles,\r\ndetached themselves from the parent mass. Such an hypothesis naturally\r\ngave rise to many theories, not less ingenious than startling, as to\r\nthe effect an incessant accumulation of ice must produce on the globe\r\nitself; and St. Pierre hinted at the possibility of the huge “domes\r\nof ice”--which, as he supposed, rose to an immense height in the keen\r\nfrosty heavens of the Poles--suddenly launching towards the Equator,\r\ndissolving under a tropical sun, and resulting in a second deluge!\r\n\r\nIn simple language Professor Tyndall furnishes an explanation of\r\nthe origin of icebergs, which we may transfer to these pages as\r\nsupplementary to the preceding remarks.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ORIGIN of ICEBERGS--EXTENSION OF A GLACIER\r\n  SEAWARDS.]\r\n\r\nWhat is their origin? he asks; and he replies, as we have done, the\r\nArctic glaciers. From the mountains in the interior the indurated snows\r\nslide into the valleys, and fill them with ice. The glaciers thus\r\ncreated move, like the Swiss ones, incessantly downward. But the Arctic\r\nglaciers descend to the sea, and even enter it, frequently ploughing up\r\nits bottom into submarine moraines. Undermined by the continuous action\r\nof the waves, and unable to resist the pressure of their own weight,\r\nthey break across, and discharge enormous masses into the ocean. Some\r\nof these drift on the adjacent shores, and often maintain themselves\r\nfor years. Others float away to the southward, and pass into the broad\r\nAtlantic, where they are finally dissolved. But a vast amount of heat\r\nis demanded for the simple liquefaction of ice, and the melting of\r\nicebergs is on this account so slow that, when large, they sometimes\r\nmaintain themselves till they have been drifted two thousand miles from\r\ntheir place of birth.\r\n\r\nIcebergs, then, are fresh-water formations, and though they are found\r\non a colossal scale only in the Polar seas, yet they are by no means\r\nuncommon among the lofty Alpine lakes.\r\n\r\nThe monarch of European ice-rivers is the great Aletsch glacier, at\r\nthe head of the valley of the Rhone. It is about twenty miles in\r\nlength, and collects its materials from the snow-drifts of the grandest\r\nmountains of the Bernese Oberland--the Jungfrau, the Mönch, the\r\nTrugberg, the Aletschhorn, the Breithorn, and the Gletscherhorn.\r\n\r\nFrom the peak of the Æggischhorn the Alpine traveller obtains a fine\r\nview of its river-like course, and he sees beneath him, on the right\r\nhand, and surrounded by sheltering mountains, an object of almost\r\nstartling beauty. “Yonder,” says Tyndall,[6] “we see the naked side of\r\nthe glacier, exposing glistening ice-cliffs sixty or seventy feet high.\r\nIt would seem as if the Aletsch here were engaged in the vain attempt\r\nto thrust an arm through a lateral valley. It once did so; but the\r\narm is now incessantly broken off close to the body of the glacier, a\r\ngreat space formerly covered by the ice being occupied by its water of\r\nliquefaction. In this way a lake of the loveliest blue is formed, which\r\nreaches quite to the base of the ice-cliffs, saps them, as the Arctic\r\nwaves sap the Greenland glaciers, and receives from them the broken\r\nmasses which it has undermined. As we look down upon the lake, small\r\nicebergs sail over the tranquil surface, each resembling a snowy swan\r\naccompanied by its shadow.”\r\n\r\nThis lake is the Märjelen Sea of the Swiss.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE ALETSCH GLACIER, SWITZERLAND, FROM THE\r\n  ÆGGISCHHORN, SHOWING ITS MORAINES.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE MÄRJELEN SEA, SWITZERLAND.]\r\n\r\nProfessor Tyndall goes on to describe a spectacle which he witnessed,\r\nand which, as we have seen, is of frequent occurrence in the Arctic\r\nSeas. A large and lonely iceberg was floating in the middle of the\r\nlake. Suddenly he heard a sound like that of a cataract, and on\r\nlooking towards the iceberg could see the water teeming from its\r\nsides. Whence came the water? The berg had become top-heavy through\r\nthe melting underneath; it was in the act of performing a somersault,\r\nand in rolling over carried with it a vast quantity of water, which\r\nrushed like a waterfall down its sides. And the iceberg, which, but a\r\nmoment before, was snowy white, now exhibited the delicate blue colour\r\ncharacteristic of compact ice. It would soon, however, be rendered\r\nwhite again by the action of the sun.\r\n\r\nWe may contrast this picture of the solitary iceberg in the centre\r\nof the dark-blue lake with one which Dr. Hayes describes in his\r\npicturesque voyage in the open Polar Sea.\r\n\r\nAfter passing Upernavik he saw a heavy line of icebergs lying across\r\nhis course, and having no alternative, shot in among them. Some of\r\nthem proved to be of immense size--upwards of two hundred feet in\r\nheight, and a mile in length; others were not larger than the schooner\r\nwhich wound her way amongst them. Their forms were as various as their\r\ndimensions, from solid wall-sided masses of dead whiteness, with\r\nwaterfalls tumbling from them, to an old weather-worn accumulation\r\nof Gothic spires, whose crystal peaks and sharp angles melted into\r\nthe blue sky. They seemed to be endless and innumerable, and so close\r\ntogether that at a little distance they appeared to form upon the sea\r\nan unbroken canopy of ice.\r\n\r\nDr. Hayes records an adventure which may serve to give the reader an\r\nidea of the nature of the perils encountered by the Arctic explorer.\r\nThe ocean-current was carrying his schooner towards a labyrinth of\r\nicebergs at an uncomfortably rapid rate. A boat was therefore lowered,\r\nto moor a cable to a berg which lay grounded at about a hundred yards\r\ndistant. While this was being done the schooner absolutely grazed the\r\nside of a berg which rose a hundred feet above her topmasts, and then\r\nslipped past another of smaller dimensions. But a strong eddy at this\r\nmoment carried her against a huge floating mass, and though the shock\r\nwas slight, it proved sufficient to disengage some fragments of ice\r\nlarge enough to have crushed the vessel had they struck her. The berg\r\nthen began to revolve, slowly and ponderously, and to settle slowly\r\nover the threatened ship, whose destruction seemed a thing of certainty.\r\n\r\nFortunately, she was saved by the action of the berg. An immense mass\r\nbroke off from that part which lay beneath the water-surface, and this\r\ncolossal fragment, a dozen times larger than the schooner, came rushing\r\nup within a few yards of them, sending a vast volume of foam and water\r\nflying from its sides. This rupture arrested the rotatory motion of the\r\nberg, which then began to settle in another direction, and the schooner\r\nwas able to sheer off.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the crew were startled by a loud report. Another and\r\nanother followed in quick succession, until the din grew deafening,\r\nand the whole air seemed a reservoir of chaotic sounds. The opposite\r\nside of the berg had split off, piece after piece, toppling a vast\r\nvolume of ice into the sea, and sending the berg revolving back upon\r\nthe ship. Then the side nearest to them underwent the same singular\r\nprocess of disruption, and came plunging wildly down into the sea,\r\nsending over them a shower of spray, and raising a swell which rocked\r\nthe ship to and fro as in a gale of wind, and left her grinding in the\r\n_débris_ of the crumbling ruin.\r\n\r\n    “The ice was here,\r\n    The ice was there,\r\n      The ice was all around;\r\n    It creaked and growled,\r\n    And roared and howled,\r\n      Like demons in a swound.”\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, we should say, for any one who has not had actual\r\nexperience of the conditions of the Arctic world, to comprehend\r\nor imagine the immense quantity of ice upborne on its cold bleak\r\nwaters. The mere enumeration of the floating bergs at times defies the\r\nnavigator. Dr. Hayes once counted as far as five hundred, and then\r\ngave up in despair. Near by they stood out, he says, in all the rugged\r\nharshness of their sharp outlines; and from this, softening with the\r\ndistance, they melted away into the clear gray sky; and there, far\r\noff upon the sea of liquid silver, the imagination conjured up the\r\nstrangest and most wonderful groups and objects. Birds and beasts and\r\nhuman forms and architectural designs took shape in the distant masses\r\nof blue and white. The dome of St. Peter’s was recognizable here; then\r\nthe spire of a village church rose sharp and distinct; and under the\r\nshadow of the Pyramids nestled a Byzantine tower and a Grecian temple.\r\n\r\n“To the eastward,” says Dr. Hayes, describing a similar scene, “the\r\nsea was dotted with little islets--dark specks upon a brilliant\r\nsurface. Icebergs, great and small, crowded through the channels which\r\ndivided them, until in the far distance they appeared massed together,\r\nterminating against a snow-covered plain that sloped upward until it\r\nwas lost in a dim line of bluish whiteness. This line could be traced\r\nbehind the serrated coast as far to the north and south as the eye\r\ncould carry. It was the great _Mer de Glace_[7] which covers the\r\nlength and breadth of the Greenland continent. The snow-covered slope\r\nwas a glacier descending therefrom--the parent stem from which had been\r\ndischarged, at irregular intervals, many of the icebergs which troubled\r\nus so much.”\r\n\r\nWe have now brought together a sufficient number of data to assist\r\nthe reader in forming a vivid conception of those monsters of the\r\nPolar Seas, the icebergs; and to enable him, unless he is very slow\r\nof imagination, to realize to himself what they _are_, and what\r\ntheir general aspect _is_. But we may add one interesting detail,\r\nnoticed by Mr. Lament, the persevering seal-hunter, which is very\r\ngenerally overlooked.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the brief Arctic summer the increased solar warmth\r\nhas a perceptible effect upon the solid ice, and it becomes undermined\r\nand honeycombed, or, as the sailors call it, “rotten,” like a chalk\r\ncliff. It decays fastest, apparently, “between wind and water,” so that\r\nenormous caverns are excavated in the sides of the bergs.\r\n\r\nPoets never dreamed of anything more beautiful than these crystal\r\nvaults, which sometimes appear of a deep ultramarine blue, and at\r\nothers of an emerald-green tint. One could fancy them the favourite\r\nhaunts of mermaids and mermen, and of every kind of sea monster;\r\nbut, in truth, no animal ever enters them; the water dashing in and\r\nout through their icy caves and tunnels makes a sonorous but rather\r\nmonotonous and melancholy sound. In moderately calm weather many of\r\nthese excavated bergs assume the form of gigantic mushrooms, and all\r\nkinds of fantastic outlines; but as soon as a breeze of wind arises\r\nthey break up into little pieces with great rapidity.\r\n\r\nIcebergs are met with on every side of the Southern Pole, and on every\r\nmeridian of the great Antarctic Ocean. But such is not the case in the\r\nNorth. In the 360th meridian of longitude which intersects the parallel\r\nof 70° N., icebergs spread over an extent only of about fifty-five\r\ndegrees, and this is immediately in and about Greenland and Baffin Bay.\r\nOr, as Admiral Osborn puts it, for 1,375 miles of longitude we have\r\nicebergs, and then for 7,635 geographical miles none are met with. This\r\nfact is, as the same writer calls it, most interesting, and points\r\nstrongly to the probability that no extensive area of land exists about\r\nthe North Pole; a supposition strengthened by another fact, that the\r\nvast ice-fields off Spitzbergen show no signs of ever having been in\r\ncontact with land or gravel.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FALL OF AN ICEBERG.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty which besets the Arctic navigator is the “pack-ice.”\r\n\r\nIn winter, the ice from the North Pole descends so far south as to\r\nrender the coast of Newfoundland inaccessible; it envelops Greenland,\r\nsometimes even Iceland, and always surrounds and blocks up Spitzbergen\r\nand Novaia Zemlaia. But as the sun comes north this vast frozen\r\nexpanse, which stretches over several thousands of square miles,\r\nbreaks up into enormous masses. When these extend horizontally for a\r\nconsiderable distance they are called _ice-fields_. A _floe_\r\nis a detached portion of a field; a large area of floes, closely\r\ncompact together, is known as _pack-ice_; while _drift-ice_\r\nis loose ice in motion, and not so firmly welded as to prevent a ship\r\nfrom forcing her way through the yielding fragments.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: IN AN ICE-PACK, MELVILLE BAY.]\r\n\r\nThis “pack-ice,” however, is the great obstacle to Arctic exploration;\r\nand frequently it presents a barrier which no human enterprise or skill\r\ncan overpass. At times, it has been found possible to cut a channel\r\nthrough it, or it breaks up and opens a water-way through which the\r\nbold adventurer steers. In 1806, Captain Scoresby forced his ship\r\nthrough two hundred and fifty miles of pack-ice, in imminent peril,\r\nuntil he reached the parallel of 81° 50’,--his nearest approach to the\r\nPole. In 1827, Sir Edward Parry gained the latitude of 82° 45’, by\r\ndragging a boat over the ice-fields, but was then compelled to abandon\r\nhis daring and hazardous attempt, because the current carried the ice\r\nsouthward more rapidly than he could traverse it to the north.\r\n\r\nIn warm summers this mass of ice will suddenly clear away and leave an\r\nopen streak of silver sea along the west coast of Spitzbergen, varying\r\nin width from sixty to one hundred and fifty miles, and reaching as\r\nhigh as 80° or 80° 30’ N. latitude. It was through this channel that\r\nScoresby bore his ship on the expedition to which we have just alluded.\r\nA direct course from the Thames, across the Pole, to Behring Strait is\r\n3,570 geographical miles; by Lancaster Sound it is 4,660 miles. The\r\nRussians would be saved a voyage of 18,000 geographical miles could\r\nthey strike across the Pole and through Behring Strait to British\r\nColumbia, instead of going by Cape Horn.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: CHANNEL IN AN ICE-FIELD.]\r\n\r\nIce-fields, twenty to thirty miles across, are of frequent occurrence\r\nin the great Northern Ocean; sometimes they extend fully one hundred\r\nmiles, so closely and solidly packed that no opening, even for a boat,\r\nintervenes between them; they vary in thickness from ten to forty\r\nor even fifty feet. At times these fields, which are many thousand\r\nmillions of tons in weight, acquire a rapid rotatory motion, and dash\r\nagainst one another with a fury of which no words can give an accurate\r\nidea. The reader knows what awful results are produced by the collision\r\nof two railway trains, and may succeed, perhaps, in forming some feeble\r\nconception of this still more appalling scene when he remembers the\r\nhuge dimensions and solidity of the opposing forces. The waters seethe\r\nand foam, as if lashed by a tremendous tempest; the air is smitten\r\ninto stillness by the chaos of sounds, the creaking, and rending, and\r\ncracking, and heaving, as the two ice-fields are hurled against each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: “NIPPED” IN AN ICE-FIELD.]\r\n\r\nWoe to the ship caught between these grinding masses! No vessel ever\r\nbuilt by human hands could resist their pressure; and many a whaler,\r\nnavigating amid the floating fields, especially in foggy weather, has\r\nthus been doomed to destruction. Some have been caught up like reeds,\r\nand flung helplessly upon the ice; others have been overrun by the ice,\r\nand buried beneath the accumulated fragments; others have been dashed\r\nto pieces, and have gone down suddenly with all on board.\r\n\r\nThe records of Arctic exploration are full of stories of “hairbreadth\r\nescapes” from the perils of the ice-field and the ice-floe. Here is\r\none which we borrow from the voyage of the _Dorothea_ and the\r\n_Trent_, under Captain Buchan and Lieutenant Franklin.\r\n\r\nThe two vessels were making for Magdalena Bay, when they were caught in\r\na violent storm, and compelled to heave-to under storm stay-sails. Next\r\nmorning (June 30) the ice was seen along the lee, with a furious sea\r\nbreaking upon it. Close-reefed sails were out in the hope of weathering\r\nthe danger. When Buchan found that this could not be effected by his\r\nship, a slow and heavy sailer, he resolved on the desperate expedient\r\nof “taking the pack,” in preference to falling, broadside on, among\r\nthe roaring breakers and crashing ice. “Heaven help them!” was the\r\ninvoluntary cry of those on board the _Trent_, and the prayer was\r\nall the more earnest from the conviction that a similar fate would soon\r\nbe their own.\r\n\r\nThe _Dorothea_ wore, and, impelled by wind and sea, rushed towards\r\nwhat seemed inevitable destruction; those in the _Trent_ held\r\ntheir breath while they watched the perilous exploit. The suspense\r\nlasted but a moment, for the vessel, like a snow-flake before the\r\nstorm, drove into the awful scene of foam, and spray, and broken ice,\r\nwhich formed a wall impenetrable to mortal eyesight. Whether she was\r\nlost or saved, the gallant hearts on board the _Trent_ would\r\nnever know until they too were forced into a manœuvre which appeared\r\nlike rushing into the jaws of death. But it was inevitable; and when\r\nFranklin had made all his preparations, he gave, in firm, decisive\r\ntones, the order to “put up the helm.”\r\n\r\nNo language, says Admiral Beechey, who was then serving as a lieutenant\r\non board the _Trent_, can convey an adequate idea of the terrific\r\ngrandeur of the effects produced by the collision of the ice and the\r\ntempestuous ocean. No language, on the other hand, can convey an idea\r\nof the heroic calmness and resolution of Franklin and his crew. As\r\nthey approached the terrible scene, Franklin watched for one opening\r\nless hazardous than another; but there was none. Before them stretched\r\none long line of frightful breakers, immense blocks of ice heaving,\r\nrearing, and hurtling against one another with a din which rendered the\r\nloud voice of the gallant commander almost inaudible. On the crest of a\r\nhuge billow the little _Trent_ rushed into the horrible turmoil; a\r\nshock, which quivered through the ship from stem to stern, and the crew\r\nwere flung upon the deck, and the masts bent like willow wands.\r\n\r\n“Hold on, for your lives, and stand to the helm, lads!” shouted\r\nFranklin. “Ay, ay, sir,” was the steady response from many a heroic\r\nheart. A billow came thundering against the stern of the brig; would\r\nthe brig be engulfed, or would she drive before it? Happily, she\r\nforged ahead, though shaking like a spent race-horse, and with every\r\ntimber straining and creaking. Now, thrown broadside on, her side was\r\nremorselessly battered by the floe pieces; then, tossed by the sea over\r\nice-block after ice-block, she seemed like a plaything in the grasp of\r\nan irresistible power. For some hours this severe trial of strength and\r\nfortitude endured; then the storm subsided as rapidly as it had arisen,\r\nand their gratitude for their own escape was mingled with joy at the\r\nsafety of the _Dorothea_, which they could see in the distance,\r\nstill afloat, and with her crew in safety.\r\n\r\nOn Captain Parry’s second expedition, in 1822, his ships, the\r\n_Hecla_ and the _Fury_, were placed in a position of scarcely\r\nless danger.\r\n\r\nThus we read of the _Hecla_, which at the time had been made fast\r\nby means of cables to the land-ice, that a very heavy and extensive\r\nfloe caught her on her broadside, and, being backed by another large\r\nbody of ice, gradually lifted her stern as if by the action of a wedge.\r\nThe weight every moment increasing, her crew were obliged to veer on\r\nthe hawsers, whose friction was so great as nearly to cut through\r\nthe bitt-heads, and ultimately set them on fire, so that it became\r\nrequisite to pour upon them buckets of water. At length the pressure\r\nproved irresistible; the cables snapped; but as the sea was too full of\r\nice to allow the ship to drive, the only way in which she could yield\r\nto the enormous burden brought to bear upon her was by leaning over the\r\nland-ice, while her stern at the same time was lifted clean out of the\r\nwater for fully five feet.\r\n\r\nHad another floe backed the one which lifted her, the ship must\r\ninevitably have rolled broadside over, or been rent in twain. But the\r\npressure which had been so dangerous eventually proved its safety; for,\r\nowing to its increasing weight, the floe on which she was carried burst\r\nupwards, unable to resist its force. The _Hecla_ then righted, and\r\na small channel opening up amid the driving ice, she was soon got into\r\ncomparatively smooth water.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, shortly before noon, a heavy floe, measuring\r\nsome miles in length, came down towards the _Fury_, exciting the\r\ngravest apprehensions for her safety. In a few minutes it came in\r\ncontact, at the rate of a mile and a half an hour, with a point of the\r\nland-ice, breaking it up with a tremendous roar, and forcing numberless\r\nimmense masses, perhaps many tons in weight, to the height of fifty or\r\nsixty feet; whence they again rolled down on the inner or land side,\r\nand were quickly succeeded by a fresh supply. While they were compelled\r\nto remain passive spectators of this grand but terrific sight, being\r\nwithin five or six hundred yards of the point, the danger they incurred\r\nwas twofold: first, lest the floe should swing in and serve the ship in\r\nthe same unceremonious manner; and, secondly, lest its pressure should\r\ndetach the land-ice to which they were secured, and cast them adrift\r\nat the mercy of the tides. Fortunately, neither of these terrible\r\nalternatives occurred, the floe remaining stationary for the rest of\r\nthe tide, and setting off with the ebb when the tide soon afterwards\r\nturned.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader must not imagine that an ice-field is a smooth and uniform\r\nplain, as level as an English meadow; it is, on the contrary, a\r\nrugged succession of hollows, and of protuberances called “hummocks,”\r\ninterspersed with pools of water, and occasionally intersected by\r\ndeep fissures. In many parts it can be compared only to a promiscuous\r\naccumulation of rocks closely packed together, and piled up over the\r\nextensive dreary space in great heaps and endless ridges, leaving\r\nscarcely a foot of level surface, and compelling the traveller to\r\nthread his way as best he can among the perplexing inequalities;\r\nsometimes mounting unavoidable obstructions to an elevation of ten, and\r\nagain more than a hundred feet, above the general level.\r\n\r\nThe interspaces between these closely accumulated ice-masses are filled\r\nup to some extent with drifted snow.\r\n\r\nNow, let the reader endeavour to form a definite idea of the scene\r\npresented by an ice-field. Let him watch the slow progress of the\r\nsledges as they wind through the labyrinth of broken ice-tables,\r\nthe men and dogs pulling and pushing up their respective loads, as\r\nNapoleon’s soldiers may have done when drawing their artillery through\r\nthe rugged Alpine passes, or Lord Napier’s heroes when they scaled\r\nthe steep Abyssinian heights. He will see them clambering over the\r\nvery summit of lofty ridges, where no gap occurs, and again descending\r\non the other side, the sledge frequently toppling over a precipice,\r\nsometimes capsizing, and sometimes breaking.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: AMONG THE ICE-HUMMOCKS.]\r\n\r\nAgain: he will see the adventurous party, when baffled in their attempt\r\nto cross or find a pass, breaking a track with shovel and handspike;\r\nor, again, unable even with these appliances to accomplish their end,\r\nthey retreat to seek an easier route. Perhaps they are fortunate enough\r\nto discover a kind of gap or gateway, and upon its winding and uneven\r\nsurface accomplish a mile or so with comparative ease. The snow-drifts\r\nsometimes prove an assistance, but more frequently an obstruction;\r\nfor though their surface is always hard, it is not always firm to the\r\nfoot. Then the crust gives way, and the foot sinks at the very moment\r\nwhen the other is lifted. But, worse than this, the chasms between the\r\nhummocks may be overarched with snow in such a manner as to leave a\r\nconsiderable space at the bottom void and empty; then, when everything\r\nlooks auspicious, down sinks one of the hapless explorers to his waist,\r\nanother to the neck, a third is “lost to sight,” the sledge gives way,\r\nand all is confusion worse confounded! To educe order out of the chaos\r\nis probably the work of hours; especially if the sledge, as is often\r\nthe case, must be unloaded. Not unfrequently it is necessary to carry\r\nthe cargo in two or three loads; the sledges are coming and going\r\ncontinually; and the day is one “endless pull and haul.”\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Hayes speaks of an ice-floe, crested with hummocks, and covered\r\nwith crusted snow, the solid contents of which lie estimated, in round\r\nnumbers, at 6,000,000,000 of tons, its depth being about one hundred\r\nand sixty feet. All around its border was banked up a kind of rampart\r\nof last year’s ice, the loftiest pinnacle of which rose fully one\r\nhundred and twenty feet above the sea-level. This ice-tower consisted\r\nof blocks of ice of every shape and size, piled one upon another in the\r\ngreatest disorder. Numerous other towers, or bastions, equally rugged,\r\nthough of less elevation, sprang from the same ridge, and from every\r\npart of this desolate area; and “if a thousand Lisbons were crowded\r\ntogether and tumbled to pieces by the shock of an earthquake, the scene\r\ncould hardly be more rugged, nor to cross the ruins a severer task.”\r\n\r\nWe must date the origin of a floe like this back to a very remote\r\nperiod. Probably it was cradled, at the outset, in some deep recess of\r\nthe land, where it remained until it had accumulated to a thickness\r\nwhich defied the summer’s sun and the winter’s winds. Then it would\r\ngrow, as the glacier grows, from above; for, like the glacier, it is\r\nwholly composed of fresh ice--that is, of frozen snow. Thus it will be\r\nseen, to quote Dr. Hayes once more, that the accumulation of ice upon\r\nthe mountain-tops is in nowise different from the accumulation which\r\ntakes place upon these floating fields, where every recurring year\r\nmarks an addition to their depth. Vast as they are to the sight, and\r\npigmies as they are compared with the inland Mer de Glace, yet, in all\r\nthat concerns their growth, they are truly glaciers, dwarf floating\r\nglaciers. That only in this manner can they grow to so great a depth\r\nwill at once be conceded by the reader, if he recollects that ice soon\r\nreaches a maximum thickness by direct freezing, and that its growth\r\nis arrested by a natural law. Necessarily, this maximum thickness\r\nvaries according to the temperature of the locality: but the ice is\r\nin itself the sea’s protection. The cold air cannot absorb the warmth\r\nof the water through more than a certain thickness of ice, and that\r\nthickness attains a final limit long before the winter has reached its\r\nclose. The depth of ice formed on the first night is greater than that\r\nformed on the second; on the second is greater than on the third; on\r\nthe third greater than on the fourth; and so it continues, until the\r\nincrease no longer takes place. In other words, the ratio of increase\r\nof the thickness of ice is in inverse proportion to the duration of the\r\nperiod of freezing. There comes a time when the water beneath the ice\r\nno longer congeals, because the ice-crust above it protects it from the\r\naction of the atmosphere. Dr. Hayes asserts that he never saw an Arctic\r\nice-table _formed by direct freezing_ that exceeded eighteen\r\nfeet; and he justly adds, that were it not for this all-wise provision\r\nof the Deity,--this natural law, as our men of science term it,--the\r\nArctic waters would, ages ago, have been solid seas of ice to their\r\nprofoundest depths.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving said thus much about the various forms which the ice assumes\r\nin the Polar seas,--about their icebergs and ice-fields, pack-ice and\r\ndrift-ice, and the thick belt of ice which surrounds their shores,--we\r\nmay now direct the reader’s attention to their Animal Life; to the\r\ncreatures which inhabit them, walrus and seal and whale, the fishes,\r\nthe molluscs, and even minuter organisms.\r\n\r\nAnd first we shall begin with the Walrus, which finds a congenial home\r\nin the Arctic wildernesses.\r\n\r\n\r\nWalrus-hunting is the principal, or at all events the most lucrative,\r\noccupation of the Norse fishermen, who annually betake themselves to\r\nthe cheerless shores oi Spitzbergen in search of booty. Their life is\r\na terribly hard and dangerous one; and Mr. Lamont, who has had much\r\nexperience of them, observes that they all have a restless, weary\r\nlook about the eyes,--a look as if contracted by being perpetually in\r\nthe presence of peril. They are wild, rough, and reckless; but they\r\nare also bold, hardy, and enduring of cold, hunger, fatigue; active\r\nand energetic while at sea, though sadly intemperate during their\r\nwinter-holiday.\r\n\r\nThe vessels engaged in the seal-fishery and walrus-hunting are fitted\r\nout by the merchants of Tromsöe and Hammerfest, who have, of late\r\nyears, adopted the system of sharing their proceeds with their crews,\r\nthus giving them a direct interest in the prosperity of the expedition.\r\nThe ship is fitted out and provisioned by the owners, who also advance\r\nto the men what money they may require to purchase clothing and to make\r\nprovision for their families during their absence. Then they allot\r\none-third of the gross receipts of the adventure to the crew, dividing\r\nit into shares, three for the captain, two for the harpooneer, and one\r\neach for the common men. So that if a fairly successful voyage should\r\nrealize in skins, blubber, and ivory a sum of two thousand dollars, and\r\nthe number of hands amounts to ten, the usual strength of a seal-ship’s\r\ncrew, each will receive forty-seven and a half dollars, or about\r\n£10,--a very considerable sum for a Norwegian.\r\n\r\nEach ship carries a couple of boats, and a walrus-boat, capable of\r\nholding five men, which measures twenty-one feet in length by five feet\r\nbeam, having her main breadth at about seven feet from the bow. She\r\nis bow-shaped at both ends, and so built as to turn easily on her own\r\ncentre, besides being strong, light, and easy to row. Each man plies\r\na pair of oars hung in “grummets” to stout thole-pins; the steersman\r\ndirects the boat by also rowing a pair of oars, but with his face to\r\nthe bow; and as there are six thwarts, he can, if necessary, sit and\r\nrow like the others. By this arrangement the strength of the men is\r\neconomized, and the boat is more swiftly turned when in pursuit of the\r\nwalrus.\r\n\r\nThe steersman also acts as harpooneer, and, of course, sits in the bow.\r\nThe strongest man in the boat is usually placed next to him, to hold\r\nand haul in the line when a walrus is struck, and it is his duty to\r\nhand the harpoons and lances to the harpooneer as required.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: HUNTING THE WALRUS.]\r\n\r\nEach boat--which, by the way, is painted white, so as to resemble\r\nthe ice amongst which it moves--is usually provided with three\r\nharpoon-heads inside the bow, on each side: these fit into little racks\r\nof painted canvas, so that their keen points and edges may not be\r\nblunted, and to prevent them from injuring the men. The harpoons serve\r\nequally well for seal and walrus, and, simple as they seem and are,\r\nanswer admirably the purpose for which they are designed. The weapon\r\nis thrust into the animal; its struggles tighten the line; the large\r\nouter barb then catches up a loop of its tenacious hide, or the tough\r\nreticulated fibres containing its blubber; while the small inner barb,\r\nlike that of a fish-hook, prevents it from being detached or loosened.\r\nWhen a walrus has been properly struck, and the line hauled taut, it\r\nrarely escapes. To each harpoon a line of twelve or fifteen fathoms\r\nlong is attached: a sufficient length, as the walrus is seldom found\r\nin water more than fifteen fathoms deep; and even if the water should\r\nexceed that depth, it cannot drag the boat under, because it is unable\r\nto exert its full strength when subjected to the pressure of twelve or\r\nfifteen fathoms of water.\r\n\r\nBesides the harpoons, each boat is provided with four or five enormous\r\nlances; the shaft being made of pine-wood, nine feet long, and one\r\ninch and a half thick at the handle, increasing upwards to a thickness\r\nof two inches and a half where it enters the iron socket. This would\r\nseem a formidable weapon, and formidable it is in the stout hands of\r\na Norse harpooneer; yet, frequently, the iron shank is bent double,\r\nor the strong shaft snapped like a reed, in the violent resistance of\r\nthe sea-horse; and, therefore, to prevent the head being lost, it is\r\nfastened to the shaft by a double thong of raw seal-skin, tied round\r\nthe shank and nailed to the handle for about three feet up. The shaft\r\nmay seem of disproportionate length, but it is necessary to give the\r\nbuoyancy sufficient for floating the heavy iron spear if it should fall\r\ninto the water. This spear, or lance, is not used for seals, because it\r\nwould spoil the skins.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the destruction effected by the yearly expeditions\r\nof the walrus-hunters, the sea-horses are still found in large herds\r\nin many parts of the Polar world. Mr. Lamont describes a curious and\r\nexciting spectacle, where four large flat icebergs were seen to be so\r\nclosely packed with these animals that they were sunk almost level with\r\nthe water, and presented the appearance of “solid islands of walrus!”\r\nThe walrus lay with their heads reclining on one another’s backs and\r\nhind-quarters, just as rhinoceroses lie asleep in the dense shade\r\nof the African forests, or, to use a more commonplace but familiar\r\ncomparison, as hogs slumber and wallow in a British farmyard.\r\n\r\nSuch a sight was a temptation not to be withstood by a walrus-hunter,\r\nand Mr. Lamont and his harpooneer speedily disturbed the repose of\r\nthe monsters, which chiefly consisted of cows and young bulls. After\r\nslaying their victims, and getting them on board, came the disagreeable\r\nbut necessary task of separating the blubber from the skins to stow it\r\nin the barrels; a process which is performed in the following manner:--\r\n\r\nAcross the ship’s deck, immediately aft the hatchway, is erected a\r\nkind of framework or stage of stout timber, about four feet in height,\r\nbut sloping down at an angle of about sixty degrees, with the deck at\r\nthe forward side: on the other side it is perpendicular, and there the\r\ntwo _specksioneers_ (or “blubber-cutters”) post themselves, clad,\r\nnot in armour, but in oil-skin from top to toe, and armed with large\r\nkeen knives, curved on the edge. Then the skins are hoisted out of the\r\nhold, and, two at a time, are suspended across the frame, with the\r\nblubber side uppermost: the fat, or blubber, is next removed by a kind\r\nof _mowing_ motion of the knife, which is held in both hands, and\r\nswayed from left to right. Only long practice, and great steadiness of\r\nwrist, can give the dexterity requisite for the due performance of this\r\ndifficult operation. Even in skinning a walrus, skill is imperative.\r\n\r\nAs the blubber is mown off, it is divided into slabs, weighing twenty\r\nor thirty pounds each, and flung down the hatchway, where two men are\r\nstationed to receive it, and pack it into the casks, which when full\r\nare securely fastened up.\r\n\r\nThe skin, which is taken off the animal in two longitudinal halves, is\r\na valuable commodity, and sells at the rate of from two to four dollars\r\nper half skin. The principal purchasers are the Russian and Swedish\r\nmerchants, and its principal uses are for harness and sole leather. It\r\nis also twisted into tiller ropes, and employed to protect the rigging\r\nof ships from friction. The blubber is valued on account of the oil;\r\nbut neither has the walrus so much blubber, in proportion to its size,\r\nas the seal, nor does the blubber afford so good an oil. A seal of 600\r\nlbs. will carry 200 to 250 lbs. weight of fat; an ordinary walrus,\r\nweighing 2000 lbs., will not carry any more.\r\n\r\nThe most profitable portion of the unfortunate sea-horse is its tusks,\r\nwhich are composed of very hard, dense, and white ivory. This ivory\r\nis not so good, and consequently does not command so high a price,\r\nas elephant ivory, but is in high repute for the manufacture of false\r\nteeth, chessmen, umbrella handles, whistles, and other small articles.\r\n\r\nThe tusks are not an extra pair of teeth, but a development and\r\nmodification of the canines. For about six or seven inches of their\r\nlength they are solidly set in the mass of hard bone which forms the\r\nanimal’s upper jaw. So far as they are imbedded in the head they\r\nare hollow, but mostly filled up with a cellular osseous substance\r\ncontaining much oil; the remainder of the tusk is hard and solid\r\nthroughout.\r\n\r\nThe young walrus, or calf, has no tusks in its first year of existence;\r\nbut in its second, when it is about the size of a large seal, it has a\r\npair of much the same size as the canines of a lion. In the third year\r\nthe tusks measure about six inches in length.\r\n\r\nIn size and shape they vary greatly, according to the animal’s age and\r\nsex. A good pair of bull’s tusks, says Mr. Lamont, will be twenty-four\r\ninches each in length, and four pounds each in weight; but larger\r\nand heavier specimens are of frequent occurrence. Cows’ tusks, it is\r\nsaid, will average fully as long as those of the bulls, because less\r\nliable to be broken, but seldom weigh more than three pounds. They are\r\ngenerally set much closer together than the bull’s tusks, sometimes\r\neven overlapping one another at the points; while those of the bull\r\nwill often diverge as much as fifteen inches.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn scientific language the walrus, morse, or sea-horse (_Trichecus_),\r\nbelongs to a genus of amphibious mammals of the family _Phocidæ_,\r\na family including the well-known seals. It agrees with the other\r\nmembers of that family in the general configuration of the body\r\nand limbs, but distinctly differs from them in the head, which is\r\nremarkable,--as we have seen,--for the extraordinary development of\r\nthe canine teeth of the upper jaw, as also for the protuberant or\r\nswollen appearance of the muzzle,--due to the size of their sockets\r\nand the thickness of the upper lip. This upper lip is thickly set with\r\nstrong, transparent, bristly hairs, which measure about six inches in\r\nlength, and are as thick as a crow-quill. The terrific moustache, with\r\nthe long white curving tusks, the thick projecting muzzle, and the\r\nfierce and bloodshot eyes, give _Rosmarus trichecus_ a weird and almost\r\ndemoniacal aspect as it rears its head above the waves, and goes far\r\nto account for some of the legends of sea-monsters which embellish the\r\nScandinavian mythology.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE WALRUS, OR MORSE.]\r\n\r\nThe walrus has no canine teeth in the lower jaw. Its incisors are\r\nsmall, and ten in number; six in the upper and four in the lower jaw.\r\nThe molars, at first five on each side in each jaw, but fewer in the\r\nadult, are simple and not large; their crowns are obliquely worn. The\r\nnostrils would seem to be displaced by the sockets of the tusks; at\r\nleast they both open almost directly upwards at some distance from the\r\nmuzzle. The eyes are small, but savage; there are no external ears.\r\n\r\nThe Arctic walrus is the sole known species of the genus. It is a\r\ngregarious animal, always assembling in large herds, which occasionally\r\nleave the water to take their rest upon the shore or on the ice; and it\r\nis at such times the hunters chiefly attack them, since their movements\r\n_out_ of the water are very laborious and awkward.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A WALRUS FAMILY.]\r\n\r\nThey defend themselves against their enemies, of which the Polar bear\r\nis chief, with their formidable tusks; and these they also use in their\r\nfierce combats with one another. They fight with great determination\r\nand ferocity, using their tusks much in the same manner as game-cocks\r\nuse their beaks. From the unwieldy appearance of the animal, and the\r\nposition of its tusks, an inexperienced spectator would suppose that\r\nthe latter could be employed only in a _downward_ stroke; but, on\r\nthe contrary, it turns its neck with so much ease and rapidity that it\r\ncan strike in all directions with equal force...\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGHT BETWEEN WALRUS AND A POLAR BEAR.]\r\n\r\nOld bulls very frequently have one or both of their tusks broken;\r\nwhich may arise either from fighting or from using them to assist in\r\nscaling the rocks and ice-floes. But these broken tusks are soon worn\r\ndown again and sharpened to a point by the action of the sand, as the\r\nwalrus, like the elephant, employs its tusks in digging its food out\r\nof the ground,--that is, out of the ocean-bed. Its food principally\r\nconsists of starfish, shrimps, sandworms, clams, cockles, and algæ; and\r\nScoresby relates that he has found the remains of young seals in its\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: BOAT ATTACKED BY WALRUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reference to the gradual decay, or, more correctly speaking,\r\nextermination of the walrus, the following particulars seem to be\r\nauthentic.\r\n\r\nWhen the pursuit of the walrus was first systematically organized from\r\nTromsöe and Hammerfest, much larger vessels were employed than are\r\nnow in vogue; and it was usual for them to obtain their first cargo\r\nabout Bear Island early in the season, and two additional cargoes at\r\nSpitzbergen before the summer passed away. This regular and wholesale\r\nslaughter drove away the sea-horse herds from their haunts about Bear\r\nIsland; but even afterwards it was not a rare occurrence to procure\r\nthree cargoes in a season at Spitzbergen, and less than two full\r\ncargoes was regarded as a lamentable mishap. Now, however, more than\r\none cargo in a season is very seldom obtained, and many vessels return,\r\nafter four months’ absence, only half full.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that about one thousand walrus and twice that number of\r\nbearded seals (_Phoca barbata_) are annually captured in the seas\r\nabout Spitzbergen, exclusive of those which sink or may die of their\r\nwounds. Some idea, therefore, may be formed of the number of sea-horses\r\nwhich still ride the waves of the Polar seas. But it is quite clear\r\nthat they are undergoing a rapid diminution of numbers, and also that\r\nthey are gradually withdrawing into the inaccessible solitudes of the\r\nremotest North.\r\n\r\nWe learn from the voyage of Ohthere, which was undertaken ten centuries\r\nago, that the walrus then abounded even on the very coast of Finmarken.\r\nThey have abandoned that region, however, for some centuries, though\r\nindividual stragglers were captured up to within the last forty years.\r\nAfter their desertion of Finmarken, they retreated to Bear Island;\r\nthence they were driven to the Thousand Islands, Hope Island, and\r\nRyk-Yse Island; and thence, again, to the banks and skerries to the\r\nnorth of Spitzbergen. It is fortunate for the persecuted walrus that\r\nthe latter districts are accessible only in open seasons, or perhaps\r\nonce in every three or four summers; so that they obtain a respite and\r\ntime to breed and replenish their numbers. Otherwise the end of the\r\npresent century would mark also the total extinction of the walrus on\r\nthe island-shores of Northern Europe.\r\n\r\nWe agree with Dr. Kane that the resemblance of the walrus to man has\r\nbeen absurdly overstated. Yet the notion is put forward in some of our\r\nsystematic treatises, and accompanied by the suggestion that we are\r\nto look for the type of the merman and mermaid in this animal. If we\r\nlook we shall not find. The walrus has a square-shaped head, with a\r\nfrontal bone presenting a steep descent to the eyes, and any likeness\r\nto humanity must exist in the imagination of the spectator. Some of\r\nthe seals exhibit a much greater resemblance: the size of the head,\r\nthe regularity of the facial oval, the drooping shoulders, even the\r\nmovements of the seal, remind us impressively of man. And certainly,\r\nwhen seen at a distance, with head raised above the waves, it affords\r\nsome justification for the fanciful conception of the nymphs of ocean,\r\nthe mermaids who figure so attractively in song and legend.\r\n\r\nDr. Kane remarks that the instinct of attack, which is strong in\r\nthe walrus, though so feeble in the seal, and is a well-known\r\ncharacteristic of the pachyderms, is interesting to the naturalist,\r\nas assisting to establish the affinity of the walrus to the latter.\r\nWhen wounded, it rears its body high out of the water, plunges heavily\r\nagainst the ice, and strives to raise itself upon the surface by means\r\nof its fore-flippers. As the ice gives way under its weight, its\r\ncountenance assumes a truly ferocious expression, its bark changes to a\r\nroar, and the foam pours out from its jaws till it froths its beard.\r\n\r\nEven when not excited, the walrus manages its tusks bravely. So strong\r\nare they that they serve as grappling-irons with which to hold on to\r\nthe surface of the steep rocks and ice-banks it loves to climb; and\r\nthus it can ascend rocky islands that are sixty and a hundred feet\r\nabove the sea-level. It can deal an opponent a fearful blow, but it\r\nprefers to charge, like a veteran warrior; and man, unless well armed,\r\noften comes off second best in the contest.\r\n\r\nGovernor Flaischer told Dr. Kane that, in 1830, a brown walrus--and the\r\nEskimos say that the brown walrus are the fiercest--after being speared\r\nand wounded near Upernavik, put to flight its numerous assailants, and\r\ndrove them in fear to seek help from the Danish settlement. So violent\r\nwere its movements as to jerk out the harpoons that were launched\r\ninto its body. The governor slew it with much difficulty after it had\r\nreceived several rifle-shots and lance-wounds from his whale-boat.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGHT WITH A WALRUS.]\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, a young and adventurous Innuit plunged his\r\n_nalegeit_ into a brown walrus; but, alarmed by the savage\r\ndemeanour of the beast, called for help before using the lance. In\r\nvain the older and more wary hunters advised him to forbear. “It is a\r\nbrown walrus!” they cried; “_Aúvok-Kaiok_! Hold back!” Finding the\r\ncaution disregarded, his only brother rowed forward, and hurled the\r\nsecond harpoon. Almost instantaneously the infuriated beast charged,\r\nlike the wild boar, on the unfortunate young Innuit, and ripped open\r\nhis body.\r\n\r\nHere is a description of a walrus-hunt:--\r\n\r\nOn first setting out, the hunters listen eagerly for some sounds by\r\nwhich to discover the habitat of the animal. The walrus, like amateur\r\nvocalists, is partial to its own music, and will lie for hours enjoying\r\nthe monotonous vocalization in which it is accustomed to indulge.\r\nThis is described as something between the mooing of a cow and the\r\ndeepest baying of a mastiff; very round and full, with its “barks”\r\nor “detached notes” repeated seven to nine times in rather quick\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\nThe hunters hear the bellow, and press forward in single file; winding\r\nbehind ice-hummocks and ridges in a serpentine approach towards a group\r\nof “pond-like discolorations,” recently frozen ice-spots, which are\r\nsurrounded by older and firmer ice.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes they come in sight of the walrus. There they are, five\r\nin number, rising at intervals through the ice in a body, and breaking\r\nit up with an explosion which sounds like the report of heavy ordnance.\r\nConspicuous as the leaders of the herd are two large and fierce-looking\r\nmales.\r\n\r\nNow for a display of dexterity and skill. While the walrus remains\r\nabove water, the hunter lies flat and motionless; when it begins\r\nto sink, behold, the hunter is alert and ready to spring. In fact,\r\nscarcely is the tusked head below the water-line before every man is in\r\na rapid run; while, as if by instinct, before it returns all are prone\r\nbehind protecting knolls of ice. They seem to guess intuitively, not\r\nonly how long it will be absent, but the very point at which it will\r\nreappear. And, in this way, hiding and advancing by turns, they reach\r\na plate of thin ice, scarcely strong enough to bear a man’s weight, on\r\nthe very brink of the dark pool in which the walrus are gambolling.\r\n\r\nThe phlegmatic Eskimo harpooneer now wakens into a novel condition\r\nof excitement. His coil of walrus-hide, a well-trimmed line of many\r\nfathoms length, lies at his side. He attaches one end to an iron barb,\r\nand this he fastens loosely, by a socket, to a shaft of unicorn’s horn;\r\nthe other end is already loosed. It is the work of a second! He has\r\ngrasped the harpoon. The water eddies and whirls; puffing and panting,\r\nup comes the unwieldy sea-horse. The Eskimo rises slowly; his right arm\r\nthrown back, his left hanging close to his side. The walrus looks about\r\nhim, and throws the water off his crest; the Eskimo launches the fatal\r\nweapon, and it sinks deep into the animal’s side.\r\n\r\nDown goes the wounded _awak_, but the Eskimo is already speeding\r\nwith winged feet from the scene of combat, letting his coil run out\r\nfreely, but clutching the final loop with a desperate grip. As he runs,\r\nhe seizes a small stick of bone, roughly pointed with iron, and by\r\na swift strong movement thrusts it into the ice; he twists his line\r\naround it, and prepares for a struggle.\r\n\r\nThe wounded walrus plunges desperately, and churns the ice-pool into\r\nfoam; meantime, the line is hauled tight at one moment, and loosened\r\nthe next; for the hunter has kept his station. But the ice crashes;\r\nand a couple of walrus rear up through it, not many yards from the\r\nspot where he stands. One of them, a male, is excited, angry, partly\r\nalarmed; the other, a female, looks calm, but bent on revenge. Down,\r\nafter a rapid survey of the field, they go again into the ocean-depths;\r\nand immediately the harpooneer has chosen his position, carrying with\r\nhim his coil, and fixing it anew.\r\n\r\nScarcely is the manœuvre accomplished before the pair have once more\r\nrisen, breaking up an area of ten feet in diameter about the very spot\r\nhe left. They sink for a second time, and a second time he changes his\r\nplace. And thus continues the battle between the strength of the beast\r\nand the address of the man, till the former, half exhausted, receives a\r\nsecond wound, and gives up the contest.\r\n\r\nThe Eskimos regard the walrus with a certain degree of superstitious\r\nreverence, and it is their belief that it is under the guardianship of\r\na special representative or prototype, who does not, indeed, interfere\r\nto protect it from being hunted, but is careful that it shall be hunted\r\nunder tolerably fair conditions. They assert that near a remarkable\r\nconical peak, which rises in the solitudes of Force Bay, a great walrus\r\nlives all alone, and when the moon is absent, creeps out to the brink\r\nof a ravine, where he bellows with a voice of tremendous power.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe walrus-hunter, unless he keeps to the sea-shore, and the ice-floes\r\nwithin reach of a boat, must be prepared to undergo many hardships, and\r\nto confront with a calm heart the most baffling and terrible dangers.\r\nHe may be overtaken by a gale; and a gale in the wild remote North,\r\nfar from any shelter,--a gale which drives before it the blinding snow\r\nand pitiless icicles,--a gale which sweeps unresisted and irresistible\r\nover leagues of frozen snow,--a gale which comes down from the\r\nmountain-recesses where the glaciers take their rise,--is something so\r\ndread, so ghastly, that the dweller in temperate regions can form no\r\nidea of it.\r\n\r\nWe remember that one of the gallant seekers after Franklin describes\r\nan Arctic gale, and its effects. He says that the ice, at a short\r\ndistance from the shore, had in many places been swept bare of snow by\r\nthe driving blast; and over the glassy sheet he and his companions were\r\nhelplessly carried along before the gale. The dogs, seldom stretching\r\ntheir traces, ran howling in front of the sledges, which pressed upon\r\ntheir heels.\r\n\r\nWild was the scene, and dark. The moon had sunk far behind the\r\nsnow-shrouded mountains, and the travellers had no other light than the\r\nshimmer of stars. The deep shadows of the cliffs, towering a thousand\r\nfeet above their heads, lay heavily upon them, and enhanced the\r\nmidnight gloom. The patches of snow clinging to the sharp angles of the\r\ncolossal wall; the white shroud lying on its lofty summit; the glaciers\r\nwhich here and there protruded through its clefts, brought out into\r\nstriking relief the blackness of its cavernous recesses. The air was\r\nfilled with clouds of drift, which sometimes completely hid the land,\r\nand swept relentlessly before the explorers, as they tottered across\r\nthe frozen plain.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a dark line became visible across their path; its true nature\r\nrevealed by circling wreaths of “frost-smoke.” “_Emerk! emerk!_”\r\n(Water! water!) shouted the drivers, checking as suddenly as possible\r\nthe headway of the sledges, but not until the party were within a few\r\nfeet of a recently opened and rapidly widening crack,--a fissure in the\r\nice-crust, already twenty feet across.\r\n\r\nSome of the travellers now clambered to the summit of a pile of\r\nhummocks, and endeavoured to pierce the obscurity. A headland, laid\r\ndown on the map as Cape Alexander, lay only a few miles in advance. The\r\nice in the shallow bay on its southern side was rent in all directions;\r\nwhile beyond, from the foot of the cape, a broad sheet of water\r\nextended westward. The wind diversified its dark surface with ridges\r\nof snowy spray; while here and there a frosty surf tumbled in breakers\r\nover a small berg or drifting floe. The pieces of ice lying along its\r\nmargin were in motion, and the crash of their hard surfaces could be\r\nheard as they came into constant collision. Their strident clamour, the\r\nceaseless washing of the surface, the moaning of the wind, the steely\r\nrush of the drift, the piteous wail of the dogs, and all the strange\r\nnoises and voices of the storm, added to the gloom and awful melancholy\r\nof that moonless night.\r\n\r\nWe need not wonder that the Eskimos of the Arctic wilderness are as\r\nfearful of a tempest as are the Bedouins of the African desert. It\r\noverwhelms the one with a cloud of snow, and it buries the other in a\r\ncloud of sand; and each demands and receives its quota of victims.\r\n\r\nThat seal-hunting should be more extensively pursued than\r\nwalrus-hunting is natural; for if less exciting, it is also less\r\ndangerous; and the seal is not only a more valuable prey than the\r\nwalrus, but is more easily captured.\r\n\r\nThe Phocidæ are well represented in the Arctic waters. In Behring\r\nSea we encounter the sea-lion and the sea-bear; while from the Parry\r\nIslands to Novaia Zemlaia extends the range of the harp seal (_Phoca\r\nGrœnlandica_), the bearded seal (_Phoca barbata_), and the\r\nhispid seal (_Phoca hispida_). The skins of all these species are\r\nmore or less valuable; their oil is much esteemed; and their flesh\r\nsupplies the wild northern tribes with one of their principal articles\r\nof subsistence.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: HERD OF SEALS, NEAR THE DEVIL’S THUMB, BAFFIN SEA,\r\n  GREENLAND.]\r\n\r\nThe structure of the seal is admirably adapted in every detail to an\r\naquatic life. It lives chiefly in the water, where its motions are\r\nalways easy and graceful; but it spends a part of its time in enjoying\r\nthe sunshine on ice-fields, open shores, rocks, and sandy beaches; and\r\nthe female brings forth her young on land.\r\n\r\nThe body of the seal is elongated, and tapers considerably from the\r\nchest to the tail. The head has been compared to that of the dog; the\r\nbrain is generally voluminous. The feet are short, and little more than\r\nthe paw extends beyond the integument of the body; they are webbed, and\r\npentadactylous, or five-toed: the fore feet are set like those of other\r\nquadrupeds; but the hind feet are directed backwards, with toes which\r\ncan be spread out widely to act as paddles. The tail is short.\r\n\r\nThe motions of the seal on land are constrained and peculiar. The\r\nfore feet are but little used, and the body is thrown forward in a\r\nsuccession of jerks produced by a contraction of the spine. Awkward as\r\nthis mode of progression seems, it is, nevertheless, exceedingly rapid.\r\nThe seal, however, never ventures far from the shore, and the moment it\r\nis disturbed or alarmed it plunges into the water.\r\n\r\nThe physiognomy of the animal is in perfect accord with its character,\r\nand expresses a considerable degree of intelligence combined with much\r\nmildness of disposition. The eyes are large, black, and brilliant; the\r\nnose is broad, with oblong nostrils; and there are large whiskers.\r\nThe seal has no external ears, but in the auricular orifices exists a\r\nvalve which can be closed at will, and protects the internal organism\r\nfrom the water; the nostrils possess a similar valve. The body is\r\nthickly garnished with stiff glossy hairs, very closely set against the\r\nskin, and plentifully lubricated with an oily secretion, so that the\r\nsurface is always smooth, and unaffected by water. The teeth differ\r\nin different genera, but in all are specially adapted for the seizure\r\nof fish and other slippery prey, though the seals are omnivorous in\r\ntheir habits, and will partake both of vegetable and animal food. There\r\nare either six or four incisors in the upper, and four or two in the\r\nlower jaw; the canines are invariably large and strong; and the molars,\r\nusually five or six on either side, in each jaw, are sharp-edged or\r\nconical, and bristle with points. The seal is fond of swallowing large\r\nstones; for what purpose is not certain, but, probably, to assist\r\ndigestion.\r\n\r\nSeals live in herds, more or less numerous, along the frozen shores of\r\nthe Arctic seas; and on the lonely deserted coasts they bring forth\r\ntheir young, over which they watch with singular affection. They swim\r\nwith much rapidity, and can remain a considerable time under water.\r\nThey are migratory in their habits, and at least four species visit our\r\nBritish waters. On the northern coasts of Greenland they are observed\r\nto take their departure in July and to return again in September. They\r\nproduce two or three young at a time, and suckle them for six or seven\r\nweeks in remote caverns and sequestered recesses; after which they take\r\nto the sea. The young exhibit a remarkable degree of tractability;\r\nwill recognize and obey the maternal summons; and assist each other in\r\ndistress or danger. Many, if not all, of the species are polygamous,\r\nand the males frequently contend with desperate courage for the\r\npossession of a favourite female.\r\n\r\nThere is not much difference in the habits of the different genera\r\nor species of the Phocidæ; but while the great Arctic seal dives\r\nlike the walrus, making a kind of semi-revolution as it goes down,\r\nthe common seal (_Phoca vitulina_), called by the hunters the\r\n_stein-cobbe_, from its custom of basking on the rocks, dives by\r\nsuddenly dropping under water, its nose being the last part of its body\r\nwhich disappears, instead of its tail.\r\n\r\nThe common seal has a very fine spotted skin, and weighs about sixty\r\nor seventy pounds. It is much fatter, in proportion to its size, than\r\nthe bearded seal, and its carcass, consequently, having less specific\r\ngravity, floats much longer on the water after death.\r\n\r\nA third kind of seal found in the Spitzbergen seas is, probably, the\r\nPhoca hispida, though the hunters know it only by the names of the\r\n“springer,” and Jan Mayen seal. In the spring months it is killed in\r\nlarge numbers by the whalers among the vast ice-fields which encircle\r\nthe solitary rocks of Jan Mayen Island.\r\n\r\nMr. Lamont observes that these seals, though existing in such enormous\r\nnumbers to the west, are not nearly so numerous in Spitzbergen as\r\nthe great, or even as the much less abundant common seal. They are\r\ngregarious, which neither of the other varieties are, and generally\r\nconsort in bands of fifty to five hundred. They are extremely difficult\r\nto kill, as during the summer months they very seldom go upon the\r\nice; they seem much less curious than the other seals, and go at\r\nsuch a rapid pace through the water as to defy pursuit from a boat.\r\nOn coming up to breathe, these seals do not, like their congeners,\r\ntake a deliberate breath and a leisurely survey, but the whole troop\r\nmake a sort of simultaneous flying leap through the air like a shoal\r\nof porpoises, as they go along, and reappear again at an incredible\r\ndistance from their preceding breathing-place. Hence the name of\r\n“springers” given to them by the whalers.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE COMMON SEAL.]\r\n\r\nThe Jan Mayen seal weighs from 200 to 300 lbs., and is described as the\r\nfattest and most buoyant of the Arctic mammals.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of seal’s flesh as an important article of subsistence\r\nto the Eskimo tribes. Our Arctic voyagers and explorers have frequently\r\nbeen glad to nourish themselves upon it, and speak of it as somewhat\r\nresembling veal in flavour. Not once or twice, but several times, it\r\nhas saved the hardy pioneer of civilization from destruction, and the\r\ndiscovery of a stray seal has been the means of preserving a whole\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nThere is a very striking incident of this kind in the narrative of\r\nDr. Kane. He and his party had reached Cape York on their way to the\r\nDanish settlements, after their long but fruitless search for Sir John\r\nFranklin. They were spent with fatigue, and half-dead from hunger. A\r\nkind of low fever crippled their energies, and they were unable to\r\nsleep. In their frail and unseaworthy boats, which were scarcely kept\r\nafloat by constant bailing, they made but slow progress across the open\r\nbay; when, at this crisis of their fortunes, they descried a large seal\r\nfloating, as is the wont of these animals, on a small patch of ice, and\r\napparently asleep,--a seal so large that at first they mistook it for a\r\nwalrus.\r\n\r\nTrembling with anxiety, Kane and his companions prepared to creep down\r\nupon the monster.\r\n\r\nOne of the men, Petersen, with a large English rifle, was stationed\r\nin the bow of the boat, and stockings were drawn over the oars as\r\nmufflers. As they approached the animal, their excitement became so\r\nintense that the men could hardly keep stroke. That no sound might be\r\nheard, Dr. Kane communicated his orders by signal; and when about three\r\nhundred yards off the oars were taken in, and they moved on, stealthily\r\nand silently, with a single scull astern.\r\n\r\nThe seal was not asleep, for he reared his head when his enemies were\r\nalmost within rifle-shot; and long afterwards Dr. Kane could remember\r\nthe hard, careworn, almost despairing expression of the men’s haggard\r\nfaces as they saw him move; their lives depended on his capture. Dr.\r\nKane lowered his hand, as a signal for Petersen to fire. M’Gorry,\r\nwho was rowing, hung, he says, upon his oar, and the boat slowly but\r\nnoiselessly forging ahead, did not seem within range. Looking at\r\nPetersen, he saw that the poor fellow was paralyzed by his anxiety, and\r\nwas vainly seeking to find a rest for his gun against the cut-water of\r\nthe boat. The seal rose on his flippers, gazed at his antagonists for\r\na moment with mingled curiosity and alarm, and coiled himself for a\r\nplunge. At that moment, simultaneously with the crack of the rifle, he\r\nrelaxed his huge bulk on the ice, and, at the very brink of the water,\r\nhis head fell helplessly on one side.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SHOOTING A SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDr. Kane would have ordered another shot, but no discipline could have\r\ncontrolled his men. With a wild yell, each vociferating according to\r\nhis own impulse, they urged both boats upon the floes. A crowd of hands\r\nseized the precious booty, and bore it up to safer ice. The men seemed\r\nhalf crazy, they had been so reduced by famine. They ran over the floe,\r\ncrying and laughing, and brandishing their knives. Before five minutes\r\nhad elapsed, each man was sucking his streaming fingers or mouthing\r\nlong strips of raw blubber.\r\n\r\nNot an ounce of this seal was wasted!\r\n\r\nThe intestines found their way into the soup-kettles without any\r\nobservance of the preliminary home-processes. The cartilaginous parts\r\nof the fore-flippers were cut off in the _mêlée_, and passed\r\nround for the operation of chewing; and even the liver, warm and raw\r\nas it was, bade fair to be eaten before it had seen the pot. That\r\nnight, on the large halting-floe to which, in contempt of the dangers\r\nof drifting, the happy adventurers had hauled their boats, two entire\r\nplanks of the _Red Eric_ were devoted to the kindling of a large\r\ncooking-fire, and they enjoyed a bountiful and savage feast.\r\n\r\nSuch is an experience of Arctic life; of the hardships endured by the\r\nheroic men who go forth to do the work of Science and Civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\nReturning to the seals, we may remark that, according to a scientific\r\nauthority, the angle of weedy rock on which a phoca is accustomed to\r\nrest with his family comes to be regarded as his property, and no other\r\nindividuals of his species are entitled to lay claim to it. Although\r\nin the water these animals congregate together in numerous herds,\r\nand protect and courageously defend one another, yet, when they have\r\nonce emerged from their favourite element, they regard themselves on\r\ntheir own space of rock as in a sacred domicile, where no comrade has\r\na right to intrude on their domestic tranquillity. If any stranger\r\napproach this family centre, the chief--or shall we call him the\r\nfather?--prepares to repel by force what he considers an unwarrantable\r\nencroachment; and a terrible combat invariably ensues, which terminates\r\nonly with the death of the lord of the rock, or the compulsory retreat\r\nof the intruder.\r\n\r\nBut a family never seizes upon a larger tract than it absolutely\r\nrequires, and lives peaceably with neighbouring families, from which it\r\nis seldom separated by a greater interval than forty or fifty paces. If\r\ncompelled by necessity, they will even live on amicable terms at much\r\ncloser quarters. Three or four families will share a rock, a cavern, or\r\nan ice-floe; but each occupies the place allotted to it at the original\r\napportionment, and shuts himself within it, so to speak, nor ever\r\nmeddles with individuals of another family.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE OTARY.]\r\n\r\nOur modern naturalists divide the Phocidæ into two distinct orders: the\r\n_Phocæ_ properly so called, which have no external ears, but only\r\nan auditory orifice on the surface of the head; and the _Otariæ_,\r\nwhich are provided with external organs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe remarks we have been making apply more particularly to the common\r\nseal (_Phoca vitulina_), or small Spitzbergen seal, which\r\nmeasures from four to five feet in length. The Greenland or harp\r\nseal (_Phoca Grœnlandica_), to which we have already alluded,\r\nis larger and fatter, and is distinguished by the changes of colour\r\nit undergoes before it reaches maturity. We have also spoken of the\r\nbearded seal (_Phoca barbata_), which sometimes attains a length\r\nof ten feet, and is known, not only by its size, but its thick and\r\nstrong moustaches. The hooded seal (_Stemmatopus cristatus_) is\r\ndistinguished by the globular and expansible sac situated on the summit\r\nof the head of the males. This species grows to the length of seven or\r\neight feet, and inhabits the waters of Newfoundland and Greenland.\r\n\r\nThe value of the seal to the Eskimo tribes will best be understood from\r\na description of the uses to which various parts of the animal are\r\napplied in an Eskimo hut.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE HOODED SEAL.]\r\n\r\nWe will suppose this hut to measure about five or five and a half\r\nfeet in height, and about ten feet in diameter. The walls are made\r\nof stones, moss, and the bones of seals, narwhals, whales, and other\r\nocean-creatures. They are not arched, but recede inward gradually from\r\nthe foundation, and are capped by long oblong slabs of slate-stone\r\nextending from side to side. We enter: the flooring consists of thin\r\nflat stones. At the back part of the hut the floor rises about a foot,\r\nand this _breck_, as the elevation is called, serves both as couch\r\nand seat, being covered with a thick layer of dried moss and grass,\r\nunder seal-skins, dog-skins, and bear-skins. Similar elevations are\r\nplaced at the corners in front; under one of which will lie, perhaps,\r\na litter of pups, with their mother, and under the other a portion of\r\nseal’s meat. In the square front of the hut, above the passage-way, a\r\nwindow is inserted; the light being admitted through a square sheet\r\nof strips of dried intestines, sewed together. The entrance is in\r\nthe floor, close to the front wall, and is covered with a piece of\r\nseal-skin. Seal-skins are hung about the walls to dry. At the edge of\r\nthe _breck_, on either side, sits a woman, each busily engaged\r\nin attending to a smoky lamp, fed with seal’s oil. These lamps are\r\nmade of soapstone, and in shape resemble a clam-shell, being about\r\neight inches in diameter. The cavity is filled with oil obtained from\r\nseal’s blubber; and on the straight edge the flame burns quite vividly,\r\nthe wick which furnishes it being made of moss. The business of the\r\nwomen is apparently to prevent the lamps from smoking, and to keep\r\nthem supplied with blubber, large pieces of which are placed in the\r\ncavity, the heat drawing out the oil. About three inches above this\r\nflame hangs, suspended from the ceiling, an oblong square pot made of\r\nthe same material as the lamp, in which a joint of seal is simmering\r\nslowly. Above this hangs a rack, made of bare rib-bones, bound together\r\ncrosswise, on which stockings and mittens, and various garments made of\r\nseal-skin, are laid to dry. No other fire can be seen than that which\r\nthe lamps supply, nor is any other needed. So many persons are crowded\r\ninto the confined interior that it is insufferably hot, while the whole\r\nplace reeks with the smell of seal-flesh, seal-oil, and seal-skin!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is natural enough that we should here introduce an account of the\r\nEskimo mode of catching seals. The great season of the seal-hunt is the\r\nspring, when the inoffensive _phocæ_ gambol and sport in the open\r\nwater-ways near the coasts, or clamber on the ice-floes to enjoy the\r\nrays of the tardy sun. They are of a wary and timid disposition, and\r\nwe may suppose that their traditions have taught them to be on their\r\nguard against man; but as all their habits and ways are well known to\r\nthe Eskimo, they do not succeed in eluding his dexterous perseverance.\r\nSometimes the hunter attires himself in a seal-skin, and so exactly\r\nimitates their appearance and movements that he approaches within\r\nspear-range of them before the disguise is detected; or else he creeps\r\ninto their haunts behind a white screen, which is propelled in front\r\nof him by means of a sledge. As the season verges upon midsummer less\r\nprecaution becomes necessary; the eyes of the seals being so congested\r\nby the fierce radiance of the sun that they are often nearly blind. In\r\nwinter they are assailed while labouring at their breathing-holes, or\r\nwhen they rise for the purpose of respiration.\r\n\r\nIf an Eskimo satisfies himself that a seal is working away beneath the\r\nice, he takes up his station at the suspected point, and seldom quits\r\nit, however severe the weather, until he has captured the animal. To\r\nprotect himself from the freezing blast, he throws up a snow-wall\r\nfour feet in height, and seating himself in its shade, he rests his\r\nspears, lines, and other appliances on a number of little forked sticks\r\ninserted into the snow, in order that he may move them, when wanted,\r\nwithout making the slightest noise. He carries his caution to such\r\nan excess, that he even ties his own knees together with a thong to\r\nprevent his garments from rustling! about\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: AN ESKIMO SEAL-HUNTER.]\r\n\r\nTo discover whether the seal is still gnawing at the ice, our patient\r\nwatcher makes use of his _keep-kuttuk_; a slender rod of bone, no\r\nthicker than ordinary bell-wire, cleverly rounded, with a knob at one\r\nend and a sharp point at the other.\r\n\r\nThis implement he thrusts into the ice, and the knob, which remains\r\nabove the surface, informs him by its motion whether the animal is\r\nstill engaged in making his hole; if it does not move, the attempt\r\nis given up in that place, and the hunter betakes himself elsewhere.\r\nWhen he supposes the hole to be nearly completed, he stealthily raises\r\nhis spear, and as soon as he can hear the blowing of the seal, and\r\nknows therefore that the ice-crust is very thin, he drives it into the\r\nunsuspecting animal with all his might; and then hacks away with his\r\nsharp-edged knife, or _panna_, the intervening ice, so as to\r\nrepeat his blows, and secure his victim. The _neituk_, or Phoca\r\nhispida, being the smallest seal, is held while struggling, either\r\nby the hand, or by a line one end of which is twisted round a spear\r\ndriven into the ice. In the case of the bearded seal, or _oguka_,\r\nthe line is coiled round the hunter’s leg or arm; for a walrus, round\r\nhis body, the feet being at the same time firmly planted against a\r\nhummock of ice, so as to increase the capability of resistance. A boy\r\nof fifteen can kill a _neituk_, but the larger animals can be\r\nmastered only by a robust and experienced adult.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe come now to speak of the Whale, which, in size, is the sovereign of\r\nthe Arctic seas, and the grandest type of marine life.\r\n\r\nWhales (_Cetacea_) are, as most persons now-a-days know, an\r\norder of aquatic mammals, distinguished by their fin-like anterior\r\nextremities, and by the peculiarity that the place of the posterior\r\nextremities is supplied by a large horizontal caudal fin, or tail;\r\nwhile the cervical bones are so compressed that the animal, externally\r\nat least, seems to have no neck.\r\n\r\nThe general form of the whale, notwithstanding its position among\r\nthe Mammalia, is similar to that of the fishes, and the horizontal\r\nelongation of the body, the smooth and rounded surface, the gradual\r\nattenuation of the extremities of the trunk, and the magnitude of\r\nthe fins and tail, are specially adapted to easy and swift motion in\r\nthe water. The arrangement of the bones composing the anterior limb\r\nis very curious. The whole of the fin consists of exactly the same\r\nparts as those which we find in the human hand and arm; but they are\r\nso concealed beneath the thick cutaneous or integumentary envelope,\r\nthat not a trace of bone is visible. In this respect an intermediate\r\norganization is shown by the fore limbs of the seal.\r\n\r\nThe posterior extremity, in all the Cetacea, is either absolutely\r\ndeficient, or else rudimentary. If rudimentary, its sole vestige\r\nconsists of certain small bones, the imperfect representation of a\r\npelvis, suspended, as it were, in the flesh, and unconnected with the\r\nspinal column. Here we may observe a remarkable difference between the\r\nwhale and the seal: in the latter, as we have seen, there is a short\r\ntail, and the posterior extremities perform the office of a true caudal\r\nfin; in the former this important organ of progression consists, to use\r\nMr. Bell’s words, of “an extremely broad and powerful horizontal disc,\r\nvarying in figure in the different genera, but in all constituting\r\nthe principal instrument of locomotion.” In fishes the tail is set\r\nvertically, but in whales horizontally; and it has been well said that\r\nthe admirable adaptation of such a peculiarity in its position to the\r\nrequirements of the animal forms a fresh and beautiful illustration of\r\nthe infinite resource and foresight of the Creative Wisdom.\r\n\r\nThus: the fishes, respiring only the air contained in the dense liquid\r\nmedium in which they live, require no access to the atmosphere; and,\r\ntherefore, their progression is chiefly confined to the same region.\r\nBut the whales, breathing atmospheric air, must necessarily come to the\r\nsurface for each respiration; and hence they need a powerful instrument\r\nor lever, the position of which shall apply its impulse in a vertical\r\ndirection, so as to impel their colossal bulk from the lowest depths\r\nof ocean to the surface every time the lungs require to receive a\r\nfresh supply of atmospheric air. The greatest rapidity of motion is\r\neffected by alternate strokes of the tail against the water, upwards\r\nand downwards; but the usual progression is accomplished by an oblique\r\nlateral and downward impulse, first on one side and then on the other,\r\njust as a boat is propelled by a man with a single oar in the art of\r\n“sculling.” The extent of the tail in some of the larger species is\r\nreally immense; the superficies being no less than about a hundred\r\nsquare feet, and its breadth considerably exceeding twenty feet.\r\n\r\nThe common, right, or Greenland whale (_Balæna mysticetus_) has\r\nbeen, for centuries, the object of man’s systematic pursuit, on account\r\nof its valuable oil and scarcely less valuable baleen.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE GREENLAND WHALE.]\r\n\r\nThis whale seldom exceeds fifty to sixty feet in length, or thirty to\r\nforty in girth, and, therefore, is by no means the head of its family.\r\nAs in other species, the body is thick and bulky forwards, largest\r\nabout the middle, and tapers suddenly towards the tail. The head is\r\ncolossal; broad, flat, and rounded beneath, and narrow above; it forms\r\nabout a third of the animal’s entire length, and is about ten or twelve\r\nfeet broad. Its lips--such lips!--are five or six feet thick. They do\r\nnot cover any teeth, but they protect a pair of very formidable jaws.\r\nThe cavernous interior of the mouth is filled up with two series of\r\nwhalebone laminæ, about three hundred in each, which require particular\r\ndescription. The whalebone, or baleen, as it is called, consists of\r\nnumerous parallel plates, layers, or laminæ, each of which is formed of\r\na central coarse fibrous layer lying between two that are compact and\r\nexternally polished. But this outer part does not completely cover the\r\ninner; a kind of edge is exposed, and this edge terminates in a loose\r\nfringed or fibrous extremity. Moreover, at the base of each plate of\r\nbaleen lies a conical cavity, covering a pulp which corresponds with\r\nit; and this pulp is sunk within the substance of the gum or buccal\r\nmembrane stretched over the palate and upper jaw.\r\n\r\nThe compact _outer_ layers of the baleen plate are continuous\r\nwith a white horny layer of the gum, which passes on to the surface of\r\neach plate; and the pulp may be regarded, therefore, as the secreting\r\norgan of the internal coarse structure only. The filaments of the\r\nfringe are exceedingly numerous, and so fill up the mouth-cavity as\r\nto form a very efficient and ingenious sieve or strainer; and as the\r\nesophagus, or “swallow,” of the whale is so confined as to be unable\r\nto admit of the passage even of the smaller fish, and the food of the\r\nwhale consequently is limited to minute organisms, such as the medusæ,\r\nthis skilfully devised construction is absolutely requisite in order to\r\nretain the whole of those which are taken into the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe mode in which the whale feeds may be thus described:--\r\n\r\nThe broad waters of the Arctic seas teem with innumerable shoals of\r\nmolluscous, radiate, and crustaceous animals, and these are frequently\r\nso numerous as absolutely to colour the wave-surface.\r\n\r\nWhen a whale, therefore, desires food, it opens its colossal mouth, and\r\na host of these organisms is, as it were, swept up by the great expanse\r\nof the lower jaw: as the mouth closes, the water is ejected, and the\r\nlife it contained is imprisoned by the appliance we have attempted to\r\ndescribe.\r\n\r\nIf we consider the number of whales found in the Northern seas, and\r\nthe mighty bulk of each individual, our imagination entirely fails to\r\nappreciate the countless myriads of minute organisms which must be\r\nsacrificed to their due nourishment.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal products of the Greenland whale is its baleen,\r\nor whalebone, with the domestic uses of which our readers will be\r\nfamiliar; but the large quantities of oil which it yields are still\r\nmore valuable. A whale sixty feet in length will supply fully twenty\r\ntons of pure oil.\r\n\r\nBesides the common whale, our hunters find in the seas of the North the\r\nrazor-backed whale, or northern rorqual (_Balænoptera physalis_),\r\ncharacterized by the prominent ridge which extends along its mighty\r\nback. This monster of the deep attains a length, it is said, of\r\none hundred feet, and measures from thirty to thirty-five feet in\r\ncircumference. But its yield of oil and baleen is less than that of the\r\nright or Greenland whale, and as its capture is a task of difficulty\r\nand danger, the whalers seldom attack it. In its movements it is more\r\nrapid and restless, and when harpooned it frequently plunges downward\r\nwith such force and velocity as to break the line. In several respects\r\nit differs from the Greenland species; and particularly in the nature\r\nof its food, for it feeds upon fishes of considerable size.\r\n\r\nSome of our naturalists affirm that several species of rorquals exist\r\nin the Arctic seas; and the pike whale, so called from the resemblance\r\nof its mouth to that of a pike, is frequently described as an\r\nindependent species. Others, however, are of opinion that the pike is\r\nsimply the young of the monster we have been describing. The rorqual\r\nis very voracious, and preys extensively upon fishes; as many as six\r\nhundred cod, to say nothing of smaller “fry,” having been found in the\r\nstomach of a single individual.\r\n\r\nWhile the Greenland whale is being rapidly driven back into the icy\r\nwildernesses beyond Behring Strait, on the west, and the creeks\r\nand gulfs beyond Baffin Bay, on the east, the rorquals, including\r\nthe _Balænoptera rostratus_ (or beaked whale), _Balænoptera\r\nmusculus_, and _Balænoptera boöps_, still frequent the open\r\nwaters,--their pursuit being, as we have shown, more difficult and\r\nless profitable. They are generally found in attendance on the\r\nherring-shoals, of which they are the assiduous and destructive\r\nenemies. Off Greenland, Spitzbergen, and Novaia Zemlaia they are found\r\nin considerable numbers.\r\n\r\nOur whalers go forth every year in well-provided ships, and supplied\r\nwith the best and most formidable weapons which scientific ingenuity\r\ncan devise. Still they find the enterprise one of peril and hardship,\r\nand it is universally recognized as requiring in those who embark in\r\nit no ordinary powers of endurance, as well as courage, patience,\r\nand perseverance. Yet the Asiatic and American tribes do not fear to\r\nconfront the ocean-leviathan with the simplest of arms. The Aleüt\r\nembarks in his little skiff, or _baidar_, and catching sight of\r\nhis prey, stealthily approaches it from behind until he nearly reaches\r\nthe monster’s head. Then he suddenly and dexterously drives his short\r\nspear into the huge flank, just under the fore fin, and retreats as\r\nswiftly as his well-plied oars can carry him. If the spear has sunk\r\ninto the flesh, the whale is doomed; within the next two or three days\r\nit will perish, and the currents and the waves will hurl the vast bulk\r\non the nearest shore, to be claimed by its gallant conqueror. And as\r\neach spear bears its owner’s peculiar mark, the claim is never disputed.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the baidar does not escape in time, and the exasperated\r\nleviathan, furiously lashing the waters with its tail, hurls the frail\r\nboat high up into the air, as if it were a reed, or sinks it with\r\none crushing blow. No wonder that those of their race who undertake\r\nso hazardous a calling are held in high repute among the Aleüts. To\r\nsally forth alone, and encounter the whale in the icy waters of the\r\nPolar Sea, is a task demanding the utmost intrepidity and the utmost\r\ntranquillity of nerve.\r\n\r\nMany of the whales thus daringly harpooned are lost. It is on record\r\nthat, in the summer of 1831, one hundred and eighteen whales were\r\nstruck near Kadjack, and of these only forty-three were found. The\r\nothers either drifted to far-off shores and lonely unknown isles, or\r\nbecame the prey of sharks and ocean-birds. Wrangell states that of late\r\nyears the Russians have introduced the use of the harpoon, and engaged\r\nsome English harpooneers to teach the Aleüts the secret of their craft;\r\nand, therefore, the older and more hazardous method, which the Aleüts\r\nhad learned from their forefathers, will soon be a thing of the past.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Eskimos devote the month of August to the whale-fishery, and for\r\nthis purpose they assemble in companies, and plant a colony of huts\r\non some bold headland of the Polar coast, where the water is of depth\r\nsufficient to float their destined victim.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a whale’s colossal bulk is seen outstretched on the water,\r\na dozen kayaks or more cautiously paddle up in the rear, until one of\r\nthem, shooting ahead, comes near enough on one side for the men to\r\ndrive the spear into its flesh with all the force of both arms. To the\r\nspear are attached an inflated seal-skin and a long coil of thong. The\r\nwhale dives immediately it is stricken. After awhile it reappears, and\r\nthe signal being given by the floating seal-skin buoy, all the canoes\r\nagain paddle towards their prey. Again the opportunity is seized for\r\nlaunching the fatal spears; and this process is repeated until the\r\nexhausted whale rises more and more frequently to the surface, is\r\nfinally killed, and towed ashore.\r\n\r\nCaptain M’Clure fell in with an Eskimo tribe off Cape Bathurst which\r\nhunted the whale in this primitive fashion, but the females, as well as\r\nthe men, engaged in the pursuit. An _omaiak_, or woman’s boat, he\r\nsays, is “_manned_ by ladies,” having as harpooneer a chosen man\r\nof the tribe; and a shoal of small fry, in the form of _kayaks_,\r\nor single-men canoes, are in attendance. The harpooneer singles out “a\r\nfish,” drives into its flesh his weapon, to which an inflated seal-skin\r\nis attached by means of a walrus-hide thong. The wounded fish is then\r\nincessantly harassed by the men in the kayacks with weapons of a\r\nsimilar description; and a number of these, driven into the unfortunate\r\nwhale, baffle its efforts to escape, and wear out its strength, until,\r\nin the course of a day, it dies from exhaustion and loss of blood.\r\n\r\nSherard Osborn tells us that the harpooneer, when successful, becomes\r\na very great personage indeed, and is invariably decorated with the\r\nEskimo order of the Blue Ribbon; that is, a blue line is drawn across\r\nhis face over the bridge of his nose. This is the highest honour\r\nknown to the heroes of Cape Bathurst; but it carries along with it\r\nthe privilege of the decorated individual being allowed to take unto\r\nhimself a second wife!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the waters of Novaia Zemlaia, Greenland, and Spitzbergen is found\r\nthe narwhal, or sea unicorn (_Monodon monoceros_), which was at\r\none time the theme of so many extravagant legends. It belongs to the\r\nCetacea, but differs from the whale in having no teeth, properly so\r\ncalled, and in being armed with a formidable horn, projecting straight\r\nforward from the upper jaw, in a direct line with the body. This horn,\r\nor tusk, the use of which has not been satisfactorily ascertained, is\r\nharder and whiter than ivory, spirally striated from base to point,\r\ntapers throughout, and measures from six to ten feet in length. Mr.\r\nBell remarks that it would be a strange anomaly if the apparent\r\nsingleness of this weapon were real. In truth, _both_ teeth are\r\ninvariably found in the jaw, not only of the male, but of the female\r\nalso; but in ordinary (though not in all) cases one only, and this in\r\nthe male, is fully developed, the other remaining in a rudimentary\r\ncondition--even as both do in the female.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: NARWHALS, MALE AND FEMALE.]\r\n\r\nThe narwhal, from mouth to tail, is about twenty feet long, though\r\nindividuals measuring thirty feet are sometimes met with. Its head\r\nis short, and the upper part convex; its mouth small; its spiracle,\r\nor respiratory vent, duplicate within; its tongue long; the pectoral\r\nfins small. The back, which is convex and rather wide, has no fins,\r\nand sharpens gradually towards the tail, which, as in other Cetacea,\r\nis horizontal. The food of the narwhal, whose habits are remarkably\r\npacific, consists of medusæ, the smaller kinds of flat fish, and other\r\nmarine animals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA striking spectacle which frequently greets the eye of the voyager in\r\nthe Arctic seas is that of a shoal of dolphins gambolling and leaping,\r\nas if in the very heyday of enjoyment. The beluga, sometimes called\r\nthe white whale (_Delphinus leucos_), attracts attention by the\r\ndazzling whiteness of its body and the swiftness of its movements. It\r\nfrequents the estuaries of the Obi and the Irtish, the Mackenzie and\r\nthe Coppermine, which it sometimes ascends to a considerable distance\r\nin pursuit of the salmon. Its length varies from twelve to twenty feet;\r\nit has no dorsal fin; and its head is round, with a broad truncated\r\nsnout.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A SHOAL OF DOLPHINS.]\r\n\r\nThe black dolphin (_Globicephalus globiceps_) is also an\r\ninhabitant of the Polar seas, both beyond Behring Strait, and between\r\nGreenland and Spitzbergen. It is, however, frequently met with in\r\nwaters further south. Its length averages about twenty-four feet, and\r\nits circumference ten feet. Its smooth oily skin is bluish-black on the\r\nupper, and an obscure white on the lower, parts of the body. Twenty-two\r\nor twenty-four strong interlocking teeth in each jaw form its\r\nformidable apparatus of offence and defence; its dorsal fin is about\r\nfifteen inches high; its tail five feet broad; the pectoral fins are\r\nlong and narrow, and well adapted to assist their owner in its rapid\r\nmovements. It consorts with its kind in herds of several hundreds,\r\nunder the guidance of some old and wary males, whom the rest follow as\r\ndocilely as a flock of sheep their bell-wether; hence the Shetlanders\r\nterm it the “ca’ing whale.” Large shoals are frequently stranded on the\r\nshores of Norway, Iceland, and the Orkney, Faroe, and Shetland Isles,\r\nfurnishing the inhabitants with a welcome booty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo the same latitudes belong the ferocious orc or grampus (_Delphinus\r\norca_), the tiger of the seas, which not only attacks the porpoise\r\nand dolphin, but even the colossal whale. Its broad deep body is black\r\nabove and white beneath; the sides are marbled with black and white.\r\nThere are thirty teeth in each jaw, those in front being blunt, round,\r\nand slender, while those behind are sharp and thick; and between each\r\nis a space fitted to receive those of the opposite jaw when the mouth\r\nis closed. The back fin of the grampus is of great size; sometimes\r\nmeasuring as much as six feet in length, from the base to the tip.\r\nThe grampus generally voyages in small squadrons of four or five\r\nindividuals, following each other in single file, and alternately\r\nrising and sinking in such a manner as to resemble the undulatory\r\nmotions of a huge kraken or sea-serpent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the inhabitants of the Polar Ocean must certainly be included the\r\nPolar bear (_Thalassarctos maritimus_), since it swims and dives\r\nwith great dexterity, and, moreover, is often found on the drifting\r\nice-floes at a distance of eighty to one hundred miles from land. It\r\nis a creature of great strength, great fierceness, and great courage,\r\nthough we may not accept the exaggerated accounts of it which enliven\r\nthe narratives of the earlier voyagers.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: POLAR BEARS.]\r\n\r\nA noble creature is the Polar bear, says Sherard Osborn, whether we\r\nspeak of him by the learned titles of “Ursus maritimus,” “Thalassarctos\r\nmaritimus,” or the sailors’ more expressive nomenclature of “Jack\r\nRough!” With all her many wonders, continues this lively writer,\r\nnever did Nature create a creature more admirably adapted to the\r\nlife it has to lead. Half flesh, half fish, the seaman wandering in\r\nthe inhospitable regions of the North cannot but be struck with the\r\nappearance of latent energy and power its every action attests, as\r\nit rolls in a lithe and swaggering way over the rough surface of the\r\nfrozen sea; or, during the brief Arctic summer, haunts the broken and\r\ntreacherous “pack” in search of its prey.\r\n\r\nWhen not too loaded with fat--and it seems to fatten readily--the pace\r\nof the bear is leisurely and easy, yet at its slowest it is equal to\r\nthat of a good pedestrian; and when alarmed or irritated, its speed\r\nis surprising, though not graceful. On level ice, it flings itself\r\nahead, as it were, by a violent jerking motion of the powerful fore\r\npaws, in what has been described as an “ungainly gallop;” but it always\r\nmakes, when it can, for rough ice, where its strength and agility are\r\nbest displayed, and where neither man nor dog can overtake it. In the\r\nQueen’s Channel, during Captain M’Clure’s expedition, more than one\r\nbear was seen making its way over broken-up ice, rugged and precipitous\r\nas the mind can picture, with a truly wonderful facility; their\r\npowerful fore paws and hind legs enabling them to spring from piece to\r\npiece, scaling one fragment and sliding down another with the activity\r\nof a huge quadrumane rather than that of a quadruped. Evidently it is\r\nconscious of its superiority in such rough and perilous ground, and\r\nis generally found at the edge of the belts of hummocks or broken ice\r\nwhich intersect most ice-fields, or else amongst the frozen pack-ice of\r\nchannels such as Barrow’s and the Queen’s.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another reason why bears keep among hummocks and\r\npack-ice--namely, that near such spots water usually first makes its\r\nappearance in the summer. Seals, consequently, are most numerous\r\nthere; while the inequalities of the floe afford shelter to the bears\r\nin approaching their prey. During summer the colour of the Polar bear\r\nis of a dull yellowish hue, closely resembling that of decaying snow\r\nor ice. The fur is then thin, and the hair on the soles of their feet\r\nalmost wholly rubbed off, as with the other animals of Arctic climes;\r\nbut in the autumn, when the body has recovered from the privations\r\nof the previous winter, and a thick coating of blubber overlays his\r\ncarcass to meet the exigencies of another season of scanty fare, the\r\nfeet, as the season advances, are beautifully incased and feathered\r\nwith hair, and the animal’s colour usually turns to a very pale straw,\r\nwhich, from particular points of view, as the light strikes it, looks\r\nwhite, or nearly so. The nose and lips are of a jetty black; the eyes\r\nvary in colour. Brown is common, but some have been seen with eyes of\r\na pale gray. Their sense of smell is peculiarly acute, facilitated no\r\ndoubt by the peculiar manner in which the pure keen air of the North\r\ncarries scent to very considerable distances.\r\n\r\nSherard Osborn states that bears have been seen to follow up a scent,\r\nexactly as dogs would do; and the floes about Lowther Island, in 1851,\r\nlooked as if the bears had quartered there in search of seals, after\r\nthe fashion of a pointer in the green fields of England. The snorting\r\nnoise which they make as they approach near indicates how much more\r\nconfidence they place in their scent than in their vision; though both,\r\nwhen the hunter is concerned, are apt to deceive them.\r\n\r\nThe Polar bear attains to very formidable proportions; but when seamen\r\nspeak of monsters fifteen feet in length, their auditors may be excused\r\nfor withholding their belief. _Ten_ feet would seem to be a\r\nmaximum; and the bear need be large, strong, and muscular to master\r\nthe large Arctic seal, especially the saddle-back and bladder-nose\r\nspecies. For though it swims well and dives well, it neither swims nor\r\ndives as well as the seal, and would therefore have but little chance\r\nof obtaining a sufficient livelihood if it could not attack and capture\r\nits victim on the ice-floes.\r\n\r\nThe seal, on the other hand, fully aware of its danger, and of the only\r\nmeans of escaping from it, always keeps close to the water, whether it\r\nbe the hole it has gnawed and broken through the ice, or the open sea\r\nat the floe edge.\r\n\r\nAnd when it lies basking on the floating ice, and apparently apathetic\r\nand lethargic, nothing can exceed its vigilance. With its magnificent\r\neyes it is able to sweep a wide range of the horizon, however slightly\r\nit turns its head; its keenness of hearing adds to its security. There\r\nis something peculiarly striking in its continuous watchfulness. Now\r\nit raises its head and looks around; now it is intent on the slightest\r\nsound that travels over the crisp surface of the ice; now it gazes\r\nand listens down its hole, a needful precaution against so subtle a\r\nhunter as old Bruin! It would seem impossible to surprise an animal\r\nso vigilant and so wary; and, indeed, in circumventing its prey the\r\nbear exhibits an astuteness and a skill which overpass the bounds of\r\ninstinct, and approach closely to those of reason.\r\n\r\nFrom its scent and by its quick strong vision the bear apprehends the\r\nposition of the seal. Then it throws itself prone upon the ice, and\r\nprofiting by inequalities which are invisible to human eyes, gradually\r\nsteals upon its destined victim by a soft and scarcely perceptible\r\nmovement of the hind feet. To hide its black muzzle, it constantly\r\nuses its fore feet; and thus, only the dingy white of its coat being\r\nvisible, it is scarcely to be distinguished from the general mass of\r\nthe floe. Patiently it draws nearer and nearer; the seal, mistaking it\r\nfor one of its own congeners, or else yielding to a fatal curiosity,\r\ndelaying until its assailant, with one spring, is upon it.\r\n\r\nYet, as the old adage says, there is many a slip; and even in these\r\ncircumstances the bear does not always secure its feast. It is\r\ndisappointed sometimes just as the prey seems within its grasp; and how\r\nkeen the disappointment is can be appreciated only, we are told, by\r\nhapless Arctic travellers, “who have been hours crawling up, dreaming\r\nof delicious seal’s fry and overflowing fuel bags, and seen the prey\r\npop down a hole when within a hundred yards of it.” The great muscular\r\npower of the seal frequently enables it to fling itself into the water\r\nin spite of the bear’s efforts to hold it on the floe; Bruin, however,\r\nretains his grip, for his diving powers are not much inferior to those\r\nof the seal, and down they go together! Sometimes the bear proves\r\nvictorious, owing to mortal injuries inflicted upon the seal before it\r\nreaches the water; sometimes it may be seen reappearing at another hole\r\nin the floe, or clambering up another loose piece of ice, apparently\r\nmuch mortified by its want of success.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: BEAR CATCHING A SEAL.]\r\n\r\nAs we have said, the bear dives well, and is nearly as much at home\r\nin the water as upon the ice. If it catches sight of a seal upon a\r\ndrifting floe, it will slide quietly into the sea, swim with only the\r\ntip of its nose above the water, and, diving under the floe, reach the\r\nvery spot which the hapless seal has regarded as an oasis of safety. It\r\nis this stratagem of its enemy which has taught the seal to watch its\r\nhole so warily. Even on extensive ice-fields fast to the land, where\r\nthe bear cannot conceal its approach by taking advantage of hummocks\r\nor other inequalities, the seal is not safe; for then Bruin drops\r\ndown a hole, and swims along under the ice-crust until it reaches the\r\none where the poor seal is all unwittingly enjoying its last rays of\r\nsunshine.\r\n\r\nThe bear’s season of plenty begins with the coming of the spring. In\r\nFebruary and March the seal is giving birth to her young, who are born\r\nblind and helpless, and for ten days are unable to take to the water.\r\nThe poor mothers use every effort to protect them, but, in spite of\r\ntheir affectionate exertions, a perfect massacre of the innocents takes\r\nplace, in which, not improbably, the Arctic wolf is not less guilty\r\nthan the Arctic bear.\r\n\r\nVoracity, however, frequently proves its own Nemesis, and the bear, in\r\nits eager pursuit of prey, often involves itself in serious disaster.\r\nThe seal instinctively breeds as close as possible to the open\r\nwater. But the ice-floes, during the early equinoctial gales, will\r\nsometimes break up and drift away in the form of pack-ice; a matter\r\nof indifference, says Osborn, to the seal, but a question of life and\r\ndeath to the bear. Borne afar on their little islets of ice, rocked by\r\ntempestuous waters, buffeted by icy gales, numbers of these castaways\r\nare lost along the whole area of the Polar Sea. It is said that when\r\nthe gales blow down from the north, bears are sometimes stranded in\r\nsuch numbers on the shores of Iceland as to endanger the safety of the\r\nflocks and herds of the Icelandic peasants; and they have been known to\r\nreach the coasts of Norway.\r\n\r\nBears drifting about at a considerable distance from the land are often\r\nenough seen by the whalers. They have been discovered fully sixty miles\r\nfrom shore, in Davis Strait, without any ice in sight, and utterly\r\nexhausted by long swimming. It is thus that Nature checks their too\r\nrapid increase; for beyond the possibility of the wolf hunting it in\r\npacks and destroying the cubs, there seems no other limitation of their\r\nnumbers. The Eskimos are too few, and too badly provided with weapons,\r\nto slaughter them very extensively. Wherever seals abound, so do bears;\r\nin Barrow Strait and in the Queen’s Channel they have been seen in\r\nvery numerous troops. The Danes assert that they are plentiful about\r\nthe northern settlement of Upernavik in Greenland, for nine months\r\nin the year; and from the united testimony of the natives inhabiting\r\nthe north-eastern portion of Baffin Bay, and that of Dr. Kane, who\r\nwintered in Smith Sound, it is evident that they are plentiful about\r\nthe _polynias_, or open pools, formed there by the action of the\r\ntides.\r\n\r\nIn the summer months, when the bear is loaded with fat, it is easily\r\nhunted down, for then it can neither move swiftly nor run long; but in\r\ndeep winter its voracity and its great strength render it a formidable\r\nenemy to uncivilized and unarmed man. Usually it avoids coming into\r\ncontact with our British seamen, though instances are on record of\r\nfiercely contested engagements, in which Bruin has with difficulty been\r\ndefeated.\r\n\r\nIt is folly, says Sherard Osborn, to talk of the Polar bear\r\nhibernating: whatever bears may do on the American continent, there\r\nis only one Arctic navigator who ever saw a bear’s nest! Bears were\r\nseen at all points visited by our sailors in the course of M’Clure’s\r\nexpedition; at all times and in all temperatures; males or females,\r\nand sometimes females with their cubs. In mid-winter, as well as in\r\nmidsummer, they evidently frequented spots where tides or currents\r\noccasioned either water to constantly exist, or only allowed such a\r\nthin coating of ice to form that the seal or walrus could easily break\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nThat the Polar bear does not willingly attack man, except when hotly\r\npursued or when suffering from extreme want, is asserted by several\r\ngood authorities, and confirmed by an experience which Dr. Hayes\r\nrelates. He was strolling one day along the shore, and observing with\r\nmuch interest the effect of the recent spring-tides upon the ice-foot,\r\nwhen, rounding a point of land, he suddenly found himself confronted in\r\nthe full moonlight by an enormous bear. It had just sprung down from\r\nthe land-ice, and met Dr. Hayes at full trot, so that they caught sight\r\nof each other, man and brute, at the same moment. Being without a\r\nrifle or other means of defence, Dr. Hayes suddenly wheeled towards his\r\nship, with much the same reflections, probably, about discretion and\r\nvalour as occurred to old Jack Falstaff when the Douglas set upon him;\r\nbut discovering, after a few lengthy strides, that he was not “gobbled\r\nup,” he looked back over his shoulder, when, to his gratification as\r\nwell as surprise, he saw the bear speeding towards the open water\r\nwith a celerity which left no doubt as to the state of its mind. It\r\nwould be difficult to determine which, on this occasion, was the more\r\nfrightened, the bear or Dr. Hayes!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA curious illustration of the combined voracity and epicureanism of\r\nBruin is recorded by Dr. Kane. A _cache_, or depôt of provisions,\r\nwhich had been constructed by one of his exploring parties with great\r\ncare, and was intended to supply them with stores on their return\r\njourney, they found completely destroyed. It had been built, with\r\nevery possible precaution, of rocks brought together by heavy labour,\r\nand adjusted in the most skilful manner. So far as the means of the\r\nbuilders permitted, the entire construction was most effective and\r\nresisting. Yet these “tigers of the ice” seemed to have scarcely\r\nencountered an obstacle. Not a morsel of pemmican (preserved meat)\r\nremained, except in the iron cases, which, being round, with conical\r\nends, defied both claw and teeth. These they had rolled and pawed in\r\nevery direction,--tossing them about like footballs, although upwards\r\nof eighty pounds in weight. An alcohol-case, strongly iron-bound, was\r\ndashed into small fragments; and a tin can of liquor twisted almost\r\ninto a ball. The bears’ strong claws had perforated the metal, and torn\r\nit up as with a chisel.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: BEARS DESTROYING A CACHE.]\r\n\r\nBut the burglars were too dainty for salt meats. For ground coffee\r\nthey had evidently a relish; old canvas was also a favourite,--_de\r\ngustibus non est disputandum_; even the flag which had been reared\r\n“to take possession” of the icy wilderness, was gnawed down to the very\r\nstaff. It seemed that the bears had enjoyed a regular frolic; rolling\r\nthe bread-barrels over the ice-foot and into the broken outside ice;\r\nand finding themselves unable to masticate the heavy India-rubber\r\ncloth, they had amused themselves by tying it up in unimaginable hard\r\nknots.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe she-bear displays a strong affection for her young, which she will\r\nnot desert even in the extremity of peril. The explorer already quoted\r\nfurnishes an interesting narrative of a pursuit of mother and cub, in\r\nwhich the former’s maternal qualities were touchingly exhibited.\r\n\r\nOn the appearance of the hunting party and their dogs, the bear fled;\r\nbut the little one being unable either to keep ahead of the dogs or\r\nto maintain the same rate of speed as its mother, the latter turned\r\nback, and, putting her head under its haunches, threw it some distance\r\nforward. The cub being thus safe for the moment, she would wheel round\r\nand face the dogs, so as to give it a chance to run away; but it always\r\nstopped where it had alighted, until its mother came up, and gave\r\nit another forward impulse; it seemed to expect her aid, and would not\r\ngo forward without it. Sometimes the mother would run a few yards in\r\nadvance, as if to coax her cub up to her, and when the dogs approached\r\nshe would turn fiercely upon them, and drive them back. Then, as they\r\ndodged her blows, she would rejoin the cub, and push it on,--sometimes\r\nputting her head under it, sometimes seizing it in her mouth by the\r\nnape of its neck.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGHT WITH A WHITE BEAR.]\r\n\r\nFor some time she conducted her retreat with equal skill and celerity,\r\nleaving the two hunters far in the rear. They had sighted her on the\r\nland-ice; but she led the dogs in-shore, up a small stony valley which\r\npenetrated into the interior. After going a mile and a half, however,\r\nher pace slackened, and, the little one being spent, she soon came to a\r\nhalt, evidently determined not to desert it.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the men were only half a mile behind; and, running at\r\nfull speed, they soon reached the spot where the dogs were holding her\r\nat bay. The fight then grew desperate. The mother never moved more than\r\ntwo yards ahead, constantly and affectionately looking at her cub.\r\nWhen the dogs drew near, she sat upon her haunches, and taking the\r\nlittle one between her hind legs, she fought her assailants with her\r\npaws, roaring so loudly that she could have been heard a mile off. She\r\nwould stretch her neck and snap desperately at the nearest dog with her\r\nshining teeth, whirling her paws like the sails of a windmill. If she\r\nmissed her aim, not daring to pursue one dog lest the others should\r\npounce upon her cub, she uttered a deep howl of baffled rage, and on\r\nshe went, pawing and snapping, and facing the ring, grinning at them\r\nwith wide-opened jaws.\r\n\r\nWhen the hunters came up, the little one apparently had recovered its\r\nstrength a little, for it was able to turn round with its dam, however\r\nquickly she moved, so as always to keep in front of her belly. Meantime\r\nthe dogs were actively jumping about the she-bear, tormenting her like\r\nso many gadflies; indeed, it was difficult to fire at her without\r\nrunning the risk of killing the dogs. But Hans, one of the hunters,\r\nresting on his elbow, took a quiet, steady aim, and shot her through\r\nthe head. She dropped at once, and rolled over dead, without moving a\r\nmuscle.\r\n\r\nImmediately the dogs sprang towards her; but the cub jumped upon her\r\nbody and reared up, for the first time growling hoarsely. They seemed\r\nquite afraid of the little creature, she fought so actively, and made\r\nso much noise; and, while tearing mouthfuls of hair from the dead\r\nmother, they would spring aside the minute the cub turned towards them.\r\nThe men drove the dogs off for a time, but were compelled to shoot the\r\ncub at last, as she would not quit the body.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA still more stirring episode is recorded by Dr. Kane, which will fitly\r\nconclude our account of the Polar bear.\r\n\r\n“_Nannook! nannook!_” (A bear! a bear!) With this welcome shout,\r\nHans and Morton, two of his attendants, roused Dr. Kane one fine\r\nSaturday morning.\r\n\r\nTo the scandal of his domestic regulations, the guns were all\r\nimpracticable. While the men were loading and capping anew, Dr. Kane\r\nseized his pillow-companion six-shooter, and ran on deck, to discover\r\na medium-sized bear, with a four-months’ cub, in active warfare with\r\nthe dogs. They were hanging on her skirts, and she, with remarkable\r\nalertness, was picking out one victim after another, snatching him by\r\nthe nape of the neck, and flinging him many feet, or rather yards, by a\r\nscarcely perceptible movement of her head.\r\n\r\nTudea, the best dog, was already _hors de combat_; he had been\r\ntossed twice. Jenny, another of the pack, made an extraordinary\r\nsomerset of nearly fifty feet, and alighted senseless. Old Whitey, a\r\nveteran combatant, stanch, but not “bear-wise,” had been foremost in\r\nthe battle; soon he lay yelping, helplessly, on the snow.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if the battle were at an end; and _nannook_ certainly\r\nthought so, for she turned aside to the beef-barrels, and began with\r\nthe utmost composure to turn them over, and nose out their fatness. A\r\nbear more innocent of fear does not figure in the old, old stories of\r\nBarents and the Spitzbergen explorers.\r\n\r\nDr. Kane now lodged a pistol-ball in the side of the cub. At once the\r\nmother placed her little one between her hind legs, and, shoving it\r\nalong, made her way to the rear of the store or “beef-house.” As she\r\nwent she received a rifle-shot, but scarcely seemed to notice it. By\r\nthe unaided efforts of her fore arms she tore down the barrels of\r\nfrozen beef which made the triple walls of the store-house, mounted the\r\nrubbish, and snatching up a half barrel of herrings, carried it down in\r\nher teeth, and prepared to slip away. It was obviously time to arrest\r\nher movements. Going up within half pistol-range, Dr. Kane gave her six\r\nbuck-shot. She dropped, but instantly rose, and getting her cub into\r\nits former position, away she sped!\r\n\r\nAnd this time she would undoubtedly have effected her escape, but for\r\nthe admirable tactics of Dr. Kane’s canine Eskimo allies. The Smith\r\nSound dogs, he says, are educated more thoroughly than any of their\r\nmore southern brethren. Next to the seal and the walrus, the bear\r\nsupplies the staple diet of the tribes of the North, and, except the\r\nfox, furnishes the most important element of their wardrobe. Unlike the\r\ndogs Dr. Kane had brought with him from Baffin Bay, the Smith Sound\r\ndogs were trained, not to attack, but to embarrass. They revolved in\r\ncircles round the perplexed bear, and when pursued would keep ahead\r\nwith regulated gait, their comrades accomplishing a diversion at the\r\ncritical moment by a nip at the _nannook’s_ hind-quarters. This\r\nwas done in the most systematic manner possible, and with a truly\r\nwonderful composure. “I have seen bear-dogs elsewhere,” says Dr. Kane,\r\n“that had been drilled to relieve each other in the _mêlée_,\r\nand avoid the direct assault; but here, two dogs, without even a\r\ndemonstration of attack, would put themselves before the path of the\r\nanimal, and retreating right and left, lead him into a profitless\r\npursuit that checked his advance completely.”\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate animal was still fighting, and still retreating,\r\nembarrassed by the dogs, yet affectionately carrying along her wounded\r\ncub, and though wounded, bleeding, and fatigued, gaining ground upon\r\nher pursuers, when Hans and Dr. Kane secured the victory, such as it\r\nwas, for their own side, by delivering a couple of rifle-balls. She\r\nstaggered in front of her young one, confronted her assailants in\r\ndeath-like defiance, and did not sink until pierced by six more bullets.\r\n\r\nWhen her body was skinned, no fewer than nine balls were discovered.\r\nShe proved to be of medium size, very lean, and without a particle of\r\nfood in her stomach. Hunger, probably, had stimulated her courage to\r\ndesperation. The net weight of the cleansed carcass was 300 pounds;\r\nthat of the entire animal, 650 pounds; her length, only 7 feet 8 inches.\r\n\r\nIt is said that bears in this lean condition are more palatable and\r\nwholesome than when fat; and that the impregnation of fatty oil\r\nthrough the cellular tissues makes a well-fed bear nearly uneatable.\r\nThe flesh of a famished beast, though less nutritious as body-fuel\r\nor as a stimulating diet, is rather sweet and tender than otherwise.\r\n_Moral_: starve your bear before you eat him!\r\n\r\nThe little cub was larger than the qualifying adjective would imply.\r\nShe was taller than a dog, and her weight 114 lbs. She sprang upon\r\nthe corpse of her slaughtered mother, and rent the air with woful\r\nlamentations. All efforts to noose her she repelled with singular\r\nferocity; but at last, being completely muzzled with a line fastened\r\nby a running knot between her jaws and the back of her head, she was\r\ndragged off to the brig amid the uproar of the dogs.\r\n\r\nDr. Kane asserts that during this fight, and the compulsory somersets\r\nwhich it involved, not a dog suffered seriously. He expected, from\r\nhis knowledge of the hugging propensity of the plantigrades, that the\r\nanimal would rear, or it she did not rear, would at least use her\r\nfore arms; but she invariably seized the dogs with her teeth, and\r\nafter disposing of them for a time, refrained from following up her\r\nadvantage,--probably because she had her cub to take care of. The\r\nEskimos state that this is the habit of the hunted bear. One of the\r\nSmith Sound dogs made no exertion whatever when he was seized, but\r\nallowed himself to be flung, with all his muscles relaxed, a really\r\nfearful distance; the next instant he rose and renewed the attack.\r\nAccording to the Eskimos, the dogs soon learn this “possum-playing”\r\nhabit.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the higher the latitude, the more ferocious the\r\nbear, or that he increases in ferocity as he recedes from the usual\r\nhunting-fields.\r\n\r\nAt Oominak, one winter day, an Eskimo and his son were nearly killed by\r\na bear that had housed himself in an iceberg. They attacked him with\r\nthe lance, but he boldly turned on them, and handled them severely\r\nbefore they could make their escape.\r\n\r\nThe continued hostility of man, however, has had, in Dr. Kane’s\r\nopinion, a modifying influence upon the ursine character in South\r\nGreenland; at all events, the bears of that region never attack, and\r\neven in self-defence seldom inflict injury upon, the hunters. Many\r\ninstances have occurred where they have defended themselves, and even\r\ncharged after having been wounded, but in none of them was life lost.\r\n\r\nA stout Eskimo, an assistant to a Danish cooper of Upernavik, fired at\r\na she-bear, and the animal closed at the instant of receiving the ball.\r\nThe man had the presence of mind to fling himself prone on the ground,\r\nextending his arm to protect his head, and afterwards lying perfectly\r\nmotionless. The beast was deceived. She gave the arm a bite or two, but\r\nfinding her enemy did not stir, she retired a few paces, and sat upon\r\nher haunches to watch. But her watch was not as wary as it should have\r\nbeen, for the hunter dexterously reloaded his rifle, and slew her with\r\nthe second shot.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt has been pointed out that in approaching the bear the hunters should\r\ntake advantage of the cover afforded by the inequalities of the frozen\r\nsurface, such as its ridges and hillocks. These vary in height, from\r\nten feet to a hundred, and frequently are packed so closely together\r\nas to leave scarcely a yard of level surface. It is in such a region\r\nthat the Polar bear exhibits his utmost speed, and in such a region his\r\npursuit is attended with no slight difficulty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd after the day’s labour comes the night’s rest; but what a night! We\r\nknow what night is in these temperate climes, or in the genial southern\r\nlands; a night of stars, with a deep blue sky overspreading the happy\r\nearth like a dome of sapphire: a night of brightness and serene glory,\r\nwhen the moon is high in the heaven, and its soft radiance seems to\r\ntouch tree and stream, hill and vale, with a tint of silver; a night of\r\nstorm, when the clouds hang low and heavily, and the rain descends, and\r\na wailing rushing wind loses itself in the recesses of the shuddering\r\nwoods; we know what night is, in these temperate regions, under all\r\nits various aspects,--now mild and beautiful, now gloomy and sad, now\r\ngrand and tempestuous; the long dark night of winter with its frosty\r\nairs, and its drooping shadows thrown back by the dead surface of the\r\nsnow; the brief bright night of summer, which forms so short a pause\r\nbetween the evening of one day and the morning of another, that it\r\nseems intended only to afford the busy earth a breathing-time;--but we\r\ncan form no idea of what an _Arctic Night_ is, in all its mystery,\r\nmagnificence, and wonder. Strange stars light up the heavens; the forms\r\nof earth are strange; all is unfamiliar, and almost unintelligible.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: STALKING A BEAR.]\r\n\r\nIt is not that the Arctic night makes a heavy demand on our physical\r\nfaculties. Against its rigour man is able to defend himself; but it is\r\nless easy to provide against its strain on the moral and intellectual\r\nfaculties. The darkness which clothes Nature for so long a period\r\nreveals to the senses of the European explorer what is virtually a\r\nnew world, and the senses do not well adapt themselves to that world.\r\nThe cheering influences of the rising sun, which invite to labour;\r\nthe soothing influences of the evening twilight, which beguile to\r\nrest; that quick change from day to night, and night to day, which\r\nso lightens the burden of existence in our temperate clime to mind\r\nand soul and body, kindling the hope and renewing the courage,--all\r\nthese are wanting in the Polar world, and man suffers and languishes\r\naccordingly. The grandeur of Nature, says Dr. Hayes, ceases to give\r\ndelight to the dulled sympathies, and the heart longs continually\r\nfor new associations, new hopes, new objects, new sources of interest\r\nand pleasure. The solitude is so dark and drear as to oppress the\r\nunderstanding; the imagination is haunted by the desolation which\r\neverywhere prevails; and the silence is so absolute as to become a\r\nterror.\r\n\r\nThe lover of Nature will, of course, find much that is attractive in\r\nthe Arctic night; in the mysterious coruscations of the aurora, in\r\nthe flow of the moonlight over the hills and icebergs, in the keen\r\nclearness of the starlight, in the sublimity of the mountains and the\r\nglaciers, in the awful wildness of the storms; but it must be owned\r\nthat they speak a language which is rough, rugged, and severe.\r\n\r\nAll things seem built up on a colossal scale in the Arctic world.\r\nColossal are those dark and tempest-beaten cliffs which oppose their\r\ngrim rampart to the ceaseless roll and rush of the ice-clad waters.\r\nColossal are those mountain-peaks which raise their crests, white with\r\nunnumbered winters, into the very heavens. Colossal are those huge\r\nice-rivers, those glaciers, which, born long ago in the depths of the\r\nfar-off valleys, have gradually moved their ponderous masses down to\r\nthe ocean’s brink. Colossal are those floating islands of ice, which,\r\noutrivalling the puny architecture of man, his temples, palaces, and\r\npyramids, drift away into the wide waste of waters, as if abandoned\r\nby the Hand that called them into existence. Colossal is that vast\r\nsheet of frozen, frosty snow, shimmering with a crystalline lustre,\r\nwhich covers the icy plains for countless leagues, and stretches away,\r\nperhaps, to the very border of the sea that is supposed to encircle the\r\nunattained Pole.\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Hayes’ account of his voyage of discovery towards the North\r\nPole occurs a fine passage descriptive of the various phases of the\r\nArctic night. “I have gone out often,” he says, “into its darkness,\r\nand viewed Nature under different aspects. I have rejoiced with her\r\nin her strength, and communed with her in her repose. I have seen the\r\nwild burst of her anger, have watched her sportive play, and have\r\nbeheld her robed in silence. I have walked abroad in the darkness when\r\nthe winds were roaring through the hills and crashing over the plain.\r\nI have strolled along the beach when the only sound that broke the\r\nstillness was the dull creaking of the ice-floes, as they rose and fell\r\nlazily with the tide. I have wandered far out upon the frozen sea, and\r\nlistened to the voice of the icebergs bewailing their imprisonment;\r\nalong the glacier, where forms and falls the avalanche; upon the\r\nhill-top, where the drifting snow, coursing over the rocks, sung its\r\nplaintive song; and again, I have wandered away to some distant valley\r\nwhere all these sounds were hushed, and the air was still and solemn as\r\nthe tomb.”\r\n\r\nWhoever has been overtaken by a winter night, when crossing some snowy\r\nplain, or making his way over the hills and through the valleys, in the\r\ndeep drifts, and with the icicles pendent from the leafless boughs,\r\nand the white mantle overspreading every object dimly discernible in\r\nthe darkness, will have felt the awe and mystery of the _silence_\r\nthat then and there prevails. Both the sky above and the earth beneath\r\nreveal only an endless and unfathomable quiet. This, too, is the\r\npeculiar characteristic of the Arctic night. Evidence there is none of\r\nlife or motion. No footfall of living thing breaks on the longing ear.\r\nNo cry of bird enlivens the scene; there is no tree, among the branches\r\nof which the wind may sigh and moan. And hence it is that one who had\r\ntravelled much, and seen many dangers, and witnessed Nature in many\r\nphases, was led to say that he had seen no expression on the face of\r\nNature so filled with terror as the silence of the Arctic night.\r\n\r\nBut by degrees the darkness grows less intense, and the coming of\r\nthe day is announced by the prevalence of a kind of twilight, which\r\nincreases more and more rapidly as winter passes into spring. There are\r\nsigns that Nature is awakening once more to life and motion. The foxes\r\ncome out upon the hill side, both blue and white, and gallop hither and\r\nthither in search of food,--following in the track of the bear, to feed\r\non the refuse which the “tiger of the ice” throws aside. The walrus\r\nand the seal come more frequently to land; and the latter begins to\r\nassemble on the ice-floes, and select its breeding-places. At length,\r\nearly in February, broad daylight comes at noon, and then the weary\r\nexplorer rejoices to know that the end is near. Flocks of speckled\r\nbirds arrive, and shelter themselves under the lee of the shore;\r\nchiefly _dove-kies_, as they are called in Southern Greenland--the\r\n_Uria grylle_ of the naturalist. At last, on the 18th or 19th of\r\nFebruary, the sun once more makes its appearance above the southern\r\nhorizon, and is welcomed as one welcomes a friend who has been long\r\nlost, and is found again. Upon the crests of the hills light clouds are\r\nfloating lazily, and through these the glorious orb is pouring a stream\r\nof golden fire, and all the southern sky quivers, as it were, with\r\nthe shooting, shifting splendours of the coming day. Presently a soft\r\nbright ray breaks through the vaporous haze, kindling it into a purple\r\nsea, and touches the silvery summits of the lofty icebergs until they\r\nseem like domes and pinnacles of flame. Nearer and nearer comes that\r\nauspicious ray, and widens as it comes; and that purple sea enlarges\r\nin every direction; and those domes and pinnacles of flame multiply\r\nin quick succession as they feel the passage of the quickening light;\r\nand the dark red cliffs are warmed with an indescribable glow; and a\r\nmysterious change passes over the face of the ocean; and all Nature\r\nacknowledges the presence of the sun!\r\n\r\n“The parent of light and life everywhere,” says Dr. Hayes, “he is the\r\nsame within these solitudes. The germ awaits him here as in the Orient;\r\nbut there it rests only through the short hours of a summer night,\r\nwhile here it reposes for months under a sheet of snows. But after a\r\nwhile the bright sun will tear this sheet asunder, and will tumble it\r\nin gushing fountains to the sea, and will kiss the cold earth, and give\r\nit warmth and life; and the flowers will bud and bloom, and will turn\r\ntheir tiny faces smilingly and gratefully up to him, as he wanders over\r\nthese ancient hills in the long summer. The very glaciers will weep\r\ntears of joy at his coming. The ice will loose its iron grip upon the\r\nwaters, and will let the wild waves play in freedom. The reindeer will\r\nskip gleefully over the mountains to welcome his return, and will look\r\nlongingly to him for the green pastures. The sea-fowls, knowing that\r\nhe will give them a resting-place for their feet on the rocky islands,\r\nwill come to seek the moss-beds which he spreads for their nests; and\r\nthe sparrows will come on his life-giving rays, and will sing their\r\nlove-songs through the endless day.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the sun return the Arctic birds, and before we quit the realm of\r\nwaters we propose to glance at a few of those which frequent the cliffs\r\nand shores during the brief Polar summer.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the first-comers is the dove-kie or black guillemot (_Uria\r\ngrylle_), which migrates to the temperate climates on the approach\r\nof winter, visiting Labrador, Norway, Scotland, and even descending as\r\nfar south as Yorkshire. In fact, we know of no better place where to\r\nobserve its habits than along the immense range of perpendicular cliffs\r\nstretching from Flamborough Head to Filey Bay. Here, on the bare ledges\r\nof this colossal ocean-wall, the guillemot lays its eggs, but without\r\nthe protection of a nest; some of them parallel with the edge of the\r\nshelf, others nearly so, and others with their blunt and sharp ends\r\nindiscriminately pointing to the sea. They are not affixed to the rock\r\nby any glutinous matter, or any foreign substance whatever. You may see\r\nas many as nine or ten, or sometimes twelve, old guillemots in a line,\r\nso near to each other that their wings almost touch. The eggs vary\r\ngreatly in size and shape and colour. Some are large, others small;\r\nsome exceedingly sharp at one end, others rotund and globular. It is\r\nsaid that, if undisturbed, the guillemot never lays more than one egg;\r\nbut if that be taken away, she will lay another, and so on. But Audubon\r\nasserts that he has seen these birds sitting on as many as three eggs\r\nat a time.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SEA-BIRDS IN THE POLAR REGIONS.]\r\n\r\nThe black guillemot differs from the foolish guillemot (_Uria\r\ntroile_) only in the colour of its plumage, which, with the\r\nexception of a large white patch on the coverts of each wing, is\r\nblack, silky, and glossy; the feathers appearing to be all unwebbed,\r\nlike silky filaments or fine hair. The bill, in all the species, is\r\nslender, strong, and pointed; the upper mandible bending slightly near\r\nthe end, and the base covered with soft short feathers. The food of the\r\nguillemot consists of fish and other marine products.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Alcidæ_, or auks, are also included amongst the Arctic birds.\r\nThe little auk (_Arctica alca_) frequents the countries stretching\r\nnorthwards from our latitudes to the regions of perpetual ice, and is\r\nfound in the Polar Regions both of the Old World and the New. Here,\r\nindeed, they congregate in almost innumerable flocks. At early morn\r\nthey sally forth to get their breakfast, which consists of different\r\nvarieties of marine invertebrates, chiefly crustaceans, with which the\r\nArctic waters teem. Then they return to the shore in immense swarms.\r\nIt would be impossible, says an Arctic voyager, to convey an adequate\r\nidea of the numbers of these birds which swarmed around him. The slope\r\non both sides of the valley in which he had pitched his camp rose at\r\nan angle of about forty-five degrees to a distance of from 300 to 500\r\nfeet, where it met the cliffs, which stood about 700 feet higher. These\r\nhill-sides are composed of the loose rocks detached from the cliffs by\r\nthe action of the frost. The birds crawl among these rocks, winding far\r\nin through narrow places, and there deposit their eggs and hatch their\r\nyoung, secure from their great enemy, the Arctic fox.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE AUK.]\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, they were congregated along a slope, fully a mile in\r\nlength, and over this slope rushed a constant stream of birds, only a\r\nfew feet above the stones; and, after making in their rapid flight the\r\nwhole length of the hill, they returned higher in the air, performing\r\nover and over again the complete circuit. Occasionally a few hundreds\r\nor thousands of them would drop down, as if following some leader; and\r\nin an instant the rocks, for a space of several rods, would swarm all\r\nover with them, their black backs and pure white breasts speckling the\r\nhill very prettily.\r\n\r\nThough quantities are destroyed by the crews of vessels as well as\r\nby the Eskimos, their numbers never seem to decrease. Their flesh is\r\nboth wholesome and delicate, and affords a welcome change of diet to\r\nthe mariner weary of salt meat and pemmican. They are very tame, and\r\neasily captured,--in some places being actually caught in hand-nets,\r\nlike moths or butterflies; and they pass a great portion of their\r\ntime on the ocean, where they disport themselves with equal grace and\r\nself-possession.\r\n\r\nThe starakis (_Phaleridinæ_) inhabit the archipelagoes which lie\r\nbetween China and North America. They assemble in small flocks, and\r\nswim about in quest of the crustaceans, molluscs, and other marine\r\nanimals on which they feed. At nightfall they return to land, where\r\nthey find shelter under the ledges of the rocks, or in burrows dug with\r\ntheir bill and feet, The female lays a solitary egg.\r\n\r\nThe auks abound in the high northern latitudes. They are all\r\nocean-birds, and are never found, like the divers, in fresh-water\r\nstreams and lakes. Those species which possess the power of flight\r\nnestle on the rocky cliffs and icebergs, where they lay a single egg,\r\nof conical form; a shape which prevents it from rolling away, or\r\nmoving, except within a very narrow circle, on the bare rocky ledge\r\nwhere it is deposited.\r\n\r\nThe puffins (_Fratercola_), which in winter abound on our own\r\nshores, live chiefly on the water. They dive and swim with dexterity,\r\nbut, owing to the shortness of their wings, are capable only of\r\nlimited flight. Their plumage is thick, smooth, and dense, and so\r\ncompletely throws off the water that it is quite impervious to wet;\r\nwhile their deep, compressed, and pointed beak, resembling exactly a\r\ndouble keel, is admirably adapted as an instrument for cutting the\r\nwaves when the bird wishes to dive.\r\n\r\nThe puffins live principally upon sprats and other small fishes; and\r\nthe food intended for their young they retain until partially digested,\r\nwhen they disgorge it into their mouths. Like all the auks, the\r\nmother-bird lays but one egg.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of an island or iceberg frequented by these birds is\r\nvery vividly sketched by Audubon, than whom no naturalist has ever more\r\ncompletely attained a thorough acquaintance with the Bird-World.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PUFFINS.]\r\n\r\nHe tells us that on every crag or stone stood a puffin, at the entrance\r\nof every hole another, and yet the sea was covered and the air filled\r\nwith them. The burrows were all inhabited by young birds, of different\r\nages and sizes; and clouds of puffins flew over us, each individual\r\nholding a small fish by the head. The burrows all communicated with\r\neach other in various ways, so that the whole island seemed to be\r\nperforated by a multitude of subterranean labyrinths, over which it was\r\nimpossible to run without the risk of falling at almost every step. The\r\nvoices of the young sounded beneath the traveller’s foot like voices\r\nfrom the grave, and the stench was exceedingly disagreeable.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomething must next be said of the mergansers (_Merginæ_), a\r\nsub-family of the palmipeds, which also belong to the Polar world.\r\nTheir principal characters may thus be stated: a straight bill, much\r\ncompressed on the sides, and convex towards the tip, which is furnished\r\nwith a broad and much-hooked nail; the wings are moderate, and pointed;\r\nthe tail is short and rounded; the tarsi are short, and the toes\r\nmoderate, the outer being as long as the middle, the three anterior\r\nones united by a full web, while the hind toe is moderate, elevated,\r\nand provided with a broad web on its margin.\r\n\r\nFrom these characters it is easy to infer that the bird is aquatic in\r\nits habits; that it can swim and dive well; that it is also capable of\r\nstrong, swift flight; and that its food will consist chiefly of fishes.\r\n\r\nThe dun diver or goosander (_Mergus merganser_) is widely\r\ndistributed throughout the Polar Regions both of the eastern and\r\nwestern continents. During its southern migration, it visits the\r\nUnited States, as well as France, Holland, and Germany; but on the\r\napproach of summer it retires to Siberia and Kamtschatka, Iceland,\r\nGreenland, and the Arctic shores of North America.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE GOOSANDER].]\r\n\r\nIn these localities it constructs its nest--always near the edge of\r\nthe water; building it up of grass, roots, and similar materials,\r\nwith little regard to symmetry, and lining it with down. It is placed\r\nsometimes among the mossy, weedy stones; and sometimes it is concealed\r\nin the long grass, or under the cover of bushes, or in the stumps or\r\nhollows of decayed trees. The female lays from twelve to fourteen eggs,\r\nof a cream-yellow colour; their form is a long oval, both ends being\r\nequally obtuse. The goosander may be said to spend its time in the air\r\nand on the water; and, in truth, on the land it moves but laboriously\r\nand awkwardly, owing to the backward position of its legs. It rises\r\nwith difficulty from the ground; but when once on the wing, its course\r\nis swift, strong, and steady. As it lives mainly upon fish, its flesh\r\nis oily and ill-flavoured; a circumstance which goes far to compensate\r\nthe sportsman for the frequent failure of his attempts to capture it.\r\nIt is a wild and wary bird, and as it swims with rapidity and dives\r\nwith ease, it generally effects its escape from all but the most\r\nexperienced hunters.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother species which abounds in northern latitudes is the smew\r\n(_Mergus albellus_), also known as the white nun or white\r\nmerganser. This palmiped is about the size of a widgeon; is of elegant\r\nform; and its plumage beautifully coloured with black and white. Its\r\nbill is of a dusky blue, nearly two inches long, thickest at the base,\r\nand tapering into a slenderer and more narrow shape towards the point.\r\nAn oval black patch, glossed with green, marks each side of the head;\r\nthe under part of the crest is black; but all the rest of the head and\r\nneck, as well as the graceful breast and the belly, are white as snow,\r\nwith the exception of a curved black line on each side of the upper\r\npart of the breast, and similar marks on the lower part; the back, the\r\ncoverts on the ridge of the wings, and the primary quills are black;\r\nthe secondaries and greater coverts are white-tipped; while the sides\r\nof the body, under the wings to the tail, exhibit a curious variegation\r\nof dark wavy lines. The legs and feet are of a leaden blue.\r\n\r\nThe range of the smew is very extensive, for it migrates as far\r\nsouthward as the Mediterranean, while it is found everywhere in the\r\nArctic Regions.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A BIRD “BAZAAR” IN NOVAIA ZEMLAIA.]\r\n\r\nOn the shores of Novaia Zemlaia, as on those of Spitzbergen, the\r\nsea-birds arrive in countless hosts as soon as the summer sun has\r\nremoved the long and dreary spell under which Nature labours through\r\nthe winter months. The narrow rock-ledges on which they congregate,\r\nand where auks and guillemots assemble in thousands, the Russians\r\ncall “a bazaar.” The large gray sea-mew (_Larus glaucus_),\r\nthe “burgomaster” of the Dutch whalers, prefers the lonely summits of\r\nisolated cliffs, where it can reign the monarch of all it surveys.\r\nThe ivory gull (_Larus eburneus_) is seldom found in high\r\nnorthern latitudes; but the common gull (_Larus canus_) and the\r\nblack-backed gull (_Larus marinus_) are almost as abundant as\r\nguillemots.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE BLACK-BACKED GULL.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Iceland one of the most useful, and certainly not the\r\nleast beautiful, of the birds is the eider-duck (_Somateria\r\nmollissima_), which also frequents the shores of Baffin and Hudson\r\nBays, Lapland, Greenland, and Spitzbergen. It loves to breed on the\r\nsmall flat islands which lie off the coast, such as Akeney, Flutry,\r\nand Videy, where it is secure from the attacks of the Arctic fox. Its\r\nbreeding-places in Iceland are private property, and some of them\r\nhave been for centuries in the possession of the same families, which\r\nowe to the birds all their wealth and prosperity. Hence they are very\r\nvigilantly guarded. Whoever kills one is fined thirty dollars; and to\r\nsecrete an egg, or pocket a few downs, is an offence punishable by law.\r\nThe chief occupation of some of the proprietors is to examine through\r\ntheir telescopes all the boats that approach, so as to be sure that\r\nthere are no guns on board.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE EIDER-DUCK.]\r\n\r\nAs the birds on these islands are quite tame, the eider-down is easily\r\ncollected. The female having laid five or six pale greenish-olive eggs,\r\nin a nest fashioned with marine plants, and thickly lined with down of\r\nthe most exquisite delicacy, the collectors carefully remove her, rob\r\nthe nest of its precious lining, and then replace the bird. Immediately\r\nshe begins to lay afresh, and again has recourse to the down on her\r\nbody to protect her eggs; and should her own stock be exhausted, as is\r\nnot unfrequently the case, she is furnished with an auxiliary supply\r\nby the male. Even this second lining is often taken away, and the poor\r\nbird a third time repeats the process, both as regards the eggs and\r\nthe down; but if the plunderers do not spare her now, she afterwards\r\nabandons the nest, and seeks a home in some more sequestered nook.\r\n\r\nAs it comes to the European markets, this down, which is highly valued\r\non account of its lightness, elasticity, and warmth, occurs in balls\r\nabout the size of a man’s fist, and weighing from three to four pounds.\r\nSuch is its fineness and elastic quality, that when a ball is opened,\r\nand cautiously laid near the fire to expand, it will completely fill a\r\nquilt five feet square. It should be noted, however, that the down from\r\ndead birds is of comparatively little value, having lost its elasticity.\r\n\r\nAn interesting account of a visit to Vigr in the Isafjardardjufs,\r\na favourite resort of the eider-duck in the north of Iceland, is\r\nfurnished by Mr. Shepherd:--\r\n\r\nAs he approached the island, he says, he could see flocks upon flocks\r\nof the sacred birds, and could hear their cooings at a great distance.\r\nLanding on a rocky wave-worn shore, against which the waters scarcely\r\nrippled, he set off to survey the island. The shore he describes as\r\n“the most wonderful ornithological sight imaginable.” The ducks and\r\ntheir nests were everywhere. Great brown ducks started up under his\r\nfeet at every step; and it was with difficulty that he avoided treading\r\non some of the nests. As the island is but three-quarters of a mile\r\nacross, the opposite shore is soon reached. On the coast was a wall\r\nbuilt up of large stones, just above the high-water mark, about three\r\nfeet high, and of considerable thickness. At the bottom, on both sides\r\nof it, alternate stones had been left out, forming a series of square\r\ncompartments in which the ducks might make their nests. Almost every\r\ncompartment was occupied; and as the human intruder walked along the\r\nshore, a long line of startled ducks flew out one after the other. The\r\nsurface of the water also was white with ducks, who welcomed their\r\n“brown wives” with loud and clamorous cooing.\r\n\r\nMr. Shepherd, on arriving at the farm-house, was received in the most\r\nhospitable manner, hospitality being one of the special virtues of the\r\nIcelander. He was much impressed by the appearance of the house, which\r\nseemed to be converted into one large _duckery_. The earthen wall\r\nsurrounding it, and the window-embrasures, were filled with ducks; on\r\nthe ground, encircling the house, was a ring of ducks; on the sloping\r\nroof were seated ducks; and a duck was perched on the door-scraper!\r\n\r\nA grassy bank close by had been cut into square patches like a\r\nchess-board (a square of turf of about eighteen inches being removed,\r\nand a hollow excavated), and all these squares were occupied by ducks.\r\nA windmill was infested with them, and so were all the out houses,\r\nmounds, rocks, and crevices. In fact, the ducks were everywhere. Many\r\nof them were so tame as to allow the stranger to stroke them on their\r\nnests; and their mistress said there was scarcely a duck on the island\r\nwhich would not allow her to take its eggs without flight or fear. When\r\nshe first became possessor of the island, the produce of down from the\r\nducks did not exceed fifteen pounds weight in the year, but under her\r\ncareful nurture it had risen, in twenty years, to nearly one hundred\r\npounds annually. About a pound and a half are required to make a\r\ncoverlet for a single bed; and the down is worth from twelve to fifteen\r\nshillings per pound. Most of the eggs are taken and pickled for winter\r\nconsumption, one or two only being left to hatch.\r\n\r\n\r\nEider-ducks congregate in numerous flocks, generally in deep water;\r\nthey dive with wonderful force, and thus are enabled to capture the\r\nshell-fish which form their principal food. If a storm threatens, they\r\nretire to the rocky shores where they love to breed and rest. The\r\nGreenlanders kill them with darts, pursuing them in their little boats,\r\nwatching their course by the air-bubbles that come floating upward when\r\nthey dive, and dexterously aiming at them as soon as they rise to the\r\nsurface wearied. Their flesh is eaten by the Greenlanders, but it is\r\nnot well-flavoured; their eggs, however, are held in high esteem.\r\n\r\nThe king eider (_Somateria spectabilis_) belongs to the same genus\r\nas the former.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe suppose that every reader is acquainted with the beautiful lines in\r\nwhich Tennyson has embodied the fable of the dying swan singing its own\r\ndirge:--\r\n\r\n    “With an inner voice the river ran,\r\n    Adown it floated a dying swan,\r\n      And loudly did lament....\r\n    The wild swan’s death-hymn took the soul\r\n    Of that waste place with joy\r\n    Hidden in sorrow: at first, to the ear\r\n    The warble was low, and full, and clear;...\r\n    But anon her awful jubilant voice,\r\n    With a music strange and manifold,\r\n    Flowed forth on a carol free and bold....\r\n    And the creeping mosses and clambering weeds,\r\n    And the willow-branches hoar and dank,\r\n    And the wavy swell of the soughing reeds,\r\n    And the wave-worn horns of the echoing bank,\r\n    And the silvery marish-flowers that throng\r\n    The desolate creeks and pools among,\r\n    Were flooded over with eddying song.”\r\n\r\nBut the wild swan’s voice, even in its death-hour, has no such\r\nmusical sweetness as the poet here sets forth. It is always harsh\r\nand dissonant, and when it breaks on the silence of the Arctic skies\r\ncarries with it an almost painful impression.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE HAUNT OF THE WILD SWAN.]\r\n\r\nThe lakes of Iceland, and its streams, abound with these beautiful\r\nbirds. They are very numerous on the Myvatn, or Great Lake, as well\r\nas the wild duck, the scoter, the common goosander, the red-breasted\r\nmerganser, the scaup duck, and other anserines. The wild swan is shot\r\nor caught for its feathers, which are highly prized for ornamental\r\npurposes. It is sometimes found in large flocks, sometimes in single\r\npairs; and besides the lakes and streams, it frequents the salt and\r\nbrackish waters along the coast. It is chiefly at the pairing season,\r\nor at the approach of winter, that it assembles in multitudes; and as\r\nthe winter advances it mounts high in air, and shapes its course in\r\nsearch of milder climates.\r\n\r\nThe female builds her nest of the withered leaves and stalks of reeds\r\nand rushes, in lonely and sequestered places. She usually lays six or\r\nseven thick-shelled eggs, which are hatched in about six weeks, when\r\nboth parents assiduously guard and feed the cygnets. When full-grown,\r\nthis fine bird measures nearly five feet in length, and above seven in\r\nbreadth across its extended wings; it weighs about fifteen pounds. The\r\nentire plumage is of a pure white, and next to the skin lies a coat of\r\nthick fine down.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wealth of the Arctic and sub-Arctic seas is apparently\r\ninexhaustible. In many parts cod are plentiful, and supply the\r\nGreenlanders with a valuable article of food. The capelin (_Mullotus\r\nvitlosus_), which in May and June frequents the Greenland waters,\r\nis eaten both fresh and dried; in the latter case forming a useful\r\nwinter provision. The halibut is found of a large size; and ocean\r\nalso contributes the Norway haddock, the salmon-trout, the lump-fish,\r\nand the bull-head. Nor are the crustacea unrepresented: long-tailed\r\ncrabs being abundant, while the common mussel may be gathered almost\r\neverywhere at ebb-tide. The seas, however, grow poorer as we advance\r\ntowards the Pole, and many important species of fish do not penetrate\r\nfurther north than the Arctic Circle.\r\n\r\nYet even where these are wanting, the ocean-waters teem with life;\r\nand a recent writer is fully justified in remarking that the vast\r\nmultitudes of animated beings which people them form a remarkable\r\ncontrast to the nakedness of their bleak and desolate shores. The\r\ncolder surface-waters are, as he says, almost perpetually exposed to\r\na cold atmosphere, and being frequently covered, even in summer, with\r\nfloating ice, they are not favourable to the development of organic\r\nlife; but this adverse influence is modified by the higher temperature\r\nwhich constantly prevails at a greater depth. Contrary to the rule\r\nin the Equatorial seas, we find in the Polar-ocean an increase of\r\ntemperature from the surface downwards, in consequence of the warmer\r\nunder-currents, flowing from the south northwards, and passing beneath\r\nthe cold waters of the superficial Arctic current.\r\n\r\nHence the awful rigour of the Arctic winter, which strikes the earth\r\nwith a death-blight, is not perceptible in the ocean-depths, where\r\nmyriads of organisms find a secure retreat from the frost, and whence\r\nthey emerge during the long summer’s day, either to haunt the shores\r\nor ascend the broad rivers of the Polar world. Between the parallels\r\nof 74° and 80°, Dr. Scoresby observed that the colour of the Greenland\r\nsea varies from the purest ultramarine to olive-green, and from\r\ncrystalline transparency to striking opacity; and these appearances are\r\nnot transitory, but permanent.[8] The aspect of this green semi-opaque\r\nwater, which varies in its locality with the currents,--often forming\r\nisolated stripes, and sometimes spreading over two or three degrees of\r\nlatitude,--is mainly due to small medusæ and nudibranchiate molluscs.\r\nMany thousands of square miles must literally run riot with life, since\r\nthe coloured waters we speak of are calculated to form one-fourth of\r\nthe sea between the 74th and 80th parallels.\r\n\r\nOn the Greenland coast, where the transparency of the waters is so\r\ngreat that the bottom and every object upon it are clearly discernible,\r\neven at a depth of eighty fathoms, the ocean-bed is covered with\r\ngigantic tangles, so as to remind the spectator of the ocean-gardens\r\nof the Tropical Zone. Alcyonians, sertularians, ascidians, nullipores,\r\nmussels, and a variety of other sessile animals incrust every stone, or\r\ncongregate in every fissure and hollow of the rocky ground. A dead seal\r\nor fish flung into the sea is soon converted into a skeleton, it is\r\nsaid, by the myriads of small crustaceans which infest these northern\r\nwaters, and, like the ants in the equatorial forests, perform the part\r\nof scavengers of the deep.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is evident, from the observations of Professor Forbes, that\r\n_depth_ has a very considerable influence in the distribution of\r\nmarine life. From the surface to the depth of 1380 feet eight distinct\r\nzones or regions have been mapped out in the sea, each of which has\r\nits own vegetation and inhabitants; and the number of these regions\r\nmust now he increased, after the astonishing results of the deep-sea\r\nsoundings of Dr. Carpenter and Professor Wyville Thomson. The changes\r\nin the different zones are not abrupt: some of the creatures of an\r\nunder region always appear before those of the region above it vanish;\r\nand though there are a few species the same in some of the eight zones,\r\nonly two are common to all. It is to be observed that those near the\r\nsurface have forms and colours analogous to the inhabitants of southern\r\nlatitudes, while those at a greater depth are analogous to the animals\r\nof northern waters. Hence, in the sea, _depth_ corresponds\r\nwith latitude, as _height_ does on land. Mrs. Somerville adds,\r\nin language of much terseness, that the extent of the geographical\r\ndistribution of any species is proportioned to the depth at which it\r\nlives. Consequently, those which live near the surface are less widely\r\ndispersed than those inhabiting deep water.\r\n\r\nThe larger and more active inhabitants of the seas obey the same laws\r\nwith the rest of creation, though their provinces, or regions, are in\r\nsome instances very extensive. Above the 44th parallel the Atlantic\r\nspecies frequently correspond with those of the Pacific. The salmon\r\nof America is identical with that of the British Isles, and the\r\ncoasts of Sweden and Norway; the same is true of the _Gadidæ_,\r\nor cod. The _Cottas_, or bull-head tribe, are also the same\r\non both sides of the Atlantic; increasing in numbers and specific\r\ndifferences on approaching the Arctic seas. The same law holds good in\r\nthe North Pacific, but the _generic_ forms differ from those in\r\nthe Atlantic. From the propinquity of the coasts of America and Asia\r\nat Behring Strait, the fish on both sides are nearly alike, down to\r\nAdmiralty Inlet on the one side, and the Sea of Okhotsk on the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                             THE GLACIERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs introductory to a description of the Arctic Glaciers, a few words on\r\nthe formation of snow seem necessary. Briefly, it may be said that snow\r\nis the result of the crystallization of water.\r\n\r\nThe molecules and atoms of all substances, when not constrained by some\r\nexternal power, build themselves up into crystals. This is true of the\r\nmetals and minerals, if, after having been melted, they are allowed\r\nto cool gradually. Bismuth develops the process in a very impressive\r\nmanner, and when properly fused and solidified exhibits large-sized\r\ncrystals of singular beauty.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, sugar dissolved in water produces, after evaporation\r\nhas taken place, crystals of sugar-candy. The ready crystallization\r\nof alum is known to every school-boy who has dabbled in “chemical\r\nexperiments.” Chalk dissolved and crystallized becomes Iceland spar,\r\nand assumes a variety of fanciful and graceful shapes. The diamond is\r\ncrystallized carbon; and the crystallizing power is inherent in all our\r\nprecious stones,--sapphire, topaz, emerald, beryl, amethyst, ruby.\r\n\r\nIn the process of crystallization, it is found that the minutest\r\nparticle of matter is possessed of an attractive and a repellent pole,\r\nand that by their natural action the form and structure of the crystal\r\nare determined.\r\n\r\nThe attracting poles, in the solid condition of any given substance,\r\nare firmly interlocked; but dissolve the cohesion by the application of\r\nsufficient heat, and the poles will recede so far as to be practically\r\nbeyond each other’s range. And thus the natural tendency of the\r\nmolecules to build themselves together is neutralized.\r\n\r\nWater, for example, as a liquid is, to all appearance, without form;\r\nbut when sufficiently cooled, its molecules are brought under the\r\ninfluence of the crystallizing force, and then arrange themselves in\r\nthe most varied and beautiful shapes. When snow falls in calm air,\r\nthe icy particles present themselves in the form of six-rayed stars.\r\nFrom this type there is no departure, though the appearance of the\r\nsnow-stars in other respects is infinitely varied.\r\n\r\nIt is worth pausing, as Professor Tyndall remarks, to think what\r\nwonderful work is going on in the atmosphere during the formation and\r\ndescent of every snow-shower: what “building power” is brought into\r\nplay! and how imperfect seem the productions of human minds and hands\r\nwhen compared with those produced by the forces of Nature!\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of attracting and repelling poles; but a few words of\r\nexplanation seem desirable. Every magnet possesses two such poles;\r\nand if iron filings be scattered over a magnet, each particle becomes\r\nalso endowed with two poles. Now suppose that similar particles, devoid\r\nof weight, and floating in the atmosphere, come together, what will\r\nhappen? Obviously, the repellent poles will retreat from each other,\r\nwhile the attractive will approach, and ultimately interlock. Further:\r\nif the particles, instead of a single pair, possess several pairs of\r\npoles arranged at definite points over their surfaces, you can then\r\npicture them, in obedience to their mutual attractions and repulsions,\r\nbuilding themselves together in masses of definite shape and structure.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: VARIOUS FORMS OF SNOW-CRYSTALS.]\r\n\r\nYou have, then, only to imagine the aqueous particles in cold calm\r\nair to be gifted with poles of this description, compelling the said\r\nparticles to assume certain definite aggregates, and you have before\r\nyour mind’s eye the invisible architecture which creates the visible\r\nand beautiful crystals of the snow.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe important part played by this crystallizing force in ice as well\r\nas snow, will be understood from the following remarks by Professor\r\nTyndall, who may justly be described as the most eminent living\r\nauthority on the subject:--\r\n\r\nAt any temperature below 32° F.,--that is, freezing-point,--the\r\nmovement of heat is sufficient to loosen the molecules of water from\r\ntheir rigid bonds of cohesion. But at 32° the movement is so diminished\r\nthat the atoms lock themselves together, and unite in a solid. This\r\nact of union, however, is controlled by well-known laws. To the\r\nunintelligent eye a block of ice seems neither more interesting nor\r\nmore beautiful than a sheet of glass; but to the instructed mind the\r\nice is to the glass what an oratorio of Handel is to the scream of a\r\nballad-singer. Ice is music, glass is noise; ice represents order,\r\nglass confusion. In the latter, the molecular forces have brought about\r\nan inextricable intertangled network; in the former, they have woven\r\na rich and regular embroidery, the designs of which are infinitely\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose ourselves examining a block of ice. In what way shall\r\nwe get at its structure? A sunbeam, or if that be wanting, a ray of\r\nelectric light is the anatomist to which we must confide the work of\r\ndissection. We direct this ray straight from our lamp across the plate\r\nof transparent ice.\r\n\r\nIt shivers into pieces the icy edifice, exactly reversing the order of\r\nits architecture.\r\n\r\nThe crystallizing force, for example, had silently and systematically\r\nbuilt up atom after atom; the electric ray dislocates them (so to\r\nspeak) just as silently and systematically.\r\n\r\nWe elevate the ice-block in front of the lamp, so that the light may\r\nnow pass through its substance. Compare the ray as it enters with\r\nthe ray as it makes its exit; to the eye there is no perceptible\r\ndifference, and its intensity seems scarcely diminished. But not so\r\nwith its heat. As a thermic agent, the ray was more powerful before\r\nits entrance than it was after its emergence. A portion of its heat is\r\narrested, is detained in the ice, and of this portion we now proceed to\r\navail ourselves. What will it effect?\r\n\r\nWe place a lens in front of the ice upon the screen. Now, observe this\r\nimage (see Illustration), the beauty of which is still very far from\r\nthe real effect. Here is one star; yonder is another; and in proportion\r\nas the action continues, the ice appears to resolve itself more and\r\nmore into stars, all of six rays, like snow-crystals, and resembling\r\na beautiful flower. By moving the lens in and out, we bring new stars\r\ninto sight; and while the action continues, the edge of the petals is\r\ncovered with indentations like those of the leaf of a fern. Probably,\r\nfew of our readers have any conception of the magical beauties\r\nconcealed in a block of ice! Let them remember that prodigal Nature\r\nworks in this way throughout the whole world. Every atom of the solid\r\ncrust which covers the frozen waters of the North, has been wrought\r\nout in obedience to the law we have enunciated. Nature is always and\r\neverywhere harmonious; and it is the mission of Science to awaken us to\r\nan appreciation of its concords.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: EXHIBITION OF ICE-FLOWERS BY PROJECTION.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ICE-FLOWERS.]\r\n\r\nThere is another point of our experiment to which the reader’s\r\nattention must be directed. He sees the flowers illuminated by the\r\nray which traverses them. But if he examines them, while turning upon\r\nthem a ray which they will reflect and send back to his own eye, he\r\nwill see in the centre of each a spot with the brightness of burnished\r\nsilver. He will be tempted to think that this spot is a bubble of\r\nair; but, by immersing the ice in hot water, you can melt the ice all\r\naround the spot,--and when it alone remains, you will see it diminish\r\nand disappear without any trace of air. The spot is a vacuum. Such is\r\nthe faithfulness to herself with which Nature operates; thus, in all\r\nher operations, does she submit to her own laws. We know that ice, in\r\nmelting, contracts; and here we arrest the contraction, as it were, in\r\nthe very act. The water of the flowers cannot fill the space occupied\r\nby the ice which by its fusion has given birth to them; hence the\r\nproduction of a vacuum, the inseparable companion of each liquid flower.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fragment of compact ice whose elements assume such beautiful\r\ncrystalline forms is itself a crystal. This was shown by Sir David\r\nBrewster, who employed for the purpose of analysis that modified\r\nform of light which we call _polarised light_. It is singularly\r\nwell adapted to bring out the peculiarities of the main structure\r\nof substances, owing to the coloured figures which it outlines on a\r\nscreen after passing through them. All crystals with an axis--such, for\r\ninstance, as Iceland spar--yield a series of brilliantly-tinted rings,\r\ntraversed by a regularly-formed cross entirely black. As ice produces\r\nthe same figures, we are justified in attributing to it the same kind\r\nof crystallization. We must note, however, that we are referring now\r\nto the thick ice formed on our canals and lakes. If we examined the\r\nfirst film formed on the surface of the water, we should discover in\r\nit a completely irregular crystallization, the ray of polarised light\r\nproducing only a mosaic of varied tints, distributed without any order.\r\nBut it is easy to explain the way in which this primary crust or film\r\nis produced. Those portions of the fluid mass in contact with the air\r\nare the first to freeze, but each molecule of ice abandons its heat to\r\nthe contiguous water, which thereby is slightly raised in temperature,\r\nand the result is a partial congelation. The surface we are examining\r\nthen presents a network of fine needles intercrossed in every\r\ndirection, and forming a kind of delicate lace, the meshes or intervals\r\nof which are gradually filled up. When the network is transformed into\r\na continuous sheet, the loss of heat is diminished more and more as\r\nthis external crust grows thicker and thicker; but the development of\r\nthe ice invariably takes place by means of long interlaced needles,\r\nas the reader may see for himself by breaking off a portion from the\r\nnearest pond (in winter), and examining the sectional surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving said thus much in reference to the crystallization of ice and\r\nsnow, we proceed to explain the _regelation_ and _moulding of\r\nice_. Some years ago, Faraday astonished the scientific world by\r\na very curious experiment. Splitting into two parts a piece of ice,\r\nhe brought together the parts at the moment that fusion took place on\r\ntheir surfaces, and they united immediately. How are we to account for\r\nthis effect, which can be produced even in hot water?\r\n\r\nWhen the temperature of water rises, the surface molecules first\r\nbecome liquid, then gaseous; being placed beyond the coercitive action\r\nof the surrounding particles, they are easily set free; transported,\r\non the contrary, into the centre of the mass, they are brought\r\nabsolutely under the influence of this action, which induces a new\r\nsolidification,--or, to use the scientific term, a _regelation_.\r\nIn this way it becomes easy to understand how very various forms can be\r\ncommunicated by simple pressure to a fragment of ice. If the observer\r\nsuccessively places a straight bar in moulds of increasing curvature,\r\nhe may easily compel it to assume the shape of a ring or even of a\r\nknot. In each mould, it is true, the ice breaks; but if the pressure is\r\nkept up, the surfaces of the fragments are brought into contact, and\r\nadhere so as to re-establish a condition of continuity. A snowball may\r\nthus be converted into a sphere of ice, and the sphere, by constant\r\npressure, into a cup or a statue.\r\n\r\nProfessor Tyndall refers to a remarkable instance of regelation which\r\nhe observed one day in early spring. A layer of snow, not quite two\r\ninches thick, had fallen on the glass roof of a small conservatory, and\r\nthe internal air, warming the panes, had melted the snow so far as it\r\nwas in immediate contact with them. The entire layer had slipped down\r\nthe pane, and projected beyond the edge of the roof, without falling,\r\nand had bent and curved as required, just like a flexible body.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MOULDING ICE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe snow-fields which overspread the upper part of every glacier,\r\nwhether in the Arctic Regions or elsewhere, are composed of\r\ncrystallized snow, whose fragile, delicate, and fairy-like architecture\r\nendures so long as it remains dry, but undergoes a great transformation\r\nwhen the sun, melting the upper stratum, allows the water to\r\ninterpenetrate its substance. The fluid, congealing anew during the\r\nnight, transforms the snow into the condition technically known as\r\n_névé_; a term given by the Swiss physicists to a granular mass\r\ncomposed of small rounded icicles, disaggregated, but more adhesive\r\nthan snow-flakes, and of a density intermediate between that of snow\r\nand that of ice. Under the pressure of new layers, and as a result of\r\ninfiltrations of water, the _névé_ unites, and solders into ice of\r\nconstantly increasing compactness.\r\n\r\nBut glacier-ice presents some other curious peculiarities. Every\r\nabundant snow-fall on the summit of the mountains forms a layer easily\r\ndistinguishable from preceding layers--which, in most cases, have\r\nalready passed into the _névé_ condition. This stratification\r\nbecomes more apparent when the whiteness of the surface has been\r\nsullied by dirt or dust wafted on “the wings of the wind.” It is\r\nperceptible also in ice; but here we must not confound it with another\r\nphenomenon of which the cause is different, the _veined structure_.\r\n\r\nIn places where glaciers have been accidentally cut down in an almost\r\nvertical direction, the section is found to exhibit a series of\r\nparallel veins, formed by a beautiful and very transparent azure ice\r\nin the midst of the general mass, which is of a whitish colour, and\r\nslightly opaque.\r\n\r\nIn different glaciers, and in different parts of the same glacier,\r\nthese blue veins will vary in number and intensity of colouring. They\r\nare specially beautiful in crevasses of recent formation, and on the\r\nsides of channels excavated in the ice by tiny rills resulting from\r\nsuperficial fusion. Not a few glaciers exhibit this remarkable veined\r\nstructure throughout their entire extent. When a vertical cutting\r\nexposes the delicate azure network to atmospheric influences, the\r\nsofter ice melts prior to the fusion of the blue ice which then remains\r\nin their detached leaflets. On examining these attentively, we cannot\r\nfail to remark the absence, or, at all events, the extreme rarity, of\r\nair-bubbles, though they are so plentiful in the coarser ice.\r\n\r\nProfessor Tyndall’s explanation of this phenomenon is as interesting as\r\nit is ingenious. While on a visit of inspection to the slate-quarries\r\nof Wales, he had occasion to study the _cleavage_ of the rocks\r\nwhich compose them; in other words, their faculty of dividing\r\nnaturally, a property inherent in all crystals. The schistous slate\r\nseparates easily into sheets, and in traversing different quarries one\r\nsees that all the planes of cleavage are parallel in each. From this\r\ncircumstance our men of science were at first induced to look upon\r\nslates as the products of the stratification of different deposits.\r\nSuch an explanation, however, could not be accepted by Tyndall, when\r\nhe observed that the minute fossils embedded in them were constantly\r\nmisshapen and flattened in the direction of the plane of cleavage,\r\nbecause the great modification they had undergone could not have taken\r\nplace in superimposed strata at the bottom of the primeval sea. He\r\nconcluded that these schists, therefore, must have been subjected to a\r\nconsiderable pressure; and further, that this pressure must have been\r\nexercised at right angles with the plane of separation of the different\r\nlayers.\r\n\r\nA long series of experiments proved that many bodies, when forcibly\r\ncompressed, exhibit in their structure a very distinctly marked\r\nlamination, and frequently veins of very great beauty.\r\n\r\nHe carefully examined iron which had passed under the steam-hammer, or\r\nthrough the rolling-mill; clay and wax were subjected to the hydraulic\r\npress. In all cases he detected signs of cleavage; and hence we are\r\njustified in the inference that the phenomenon is invariably produced\r\nby pressure in all bodies of irregular internal structure. Such is the\r\nresult with glacier-ice, from whose mass the air-bubbles introduced\r\nby the snow are gradually expelled. At first of brilliant whiteness,\r\nit assumes, in the parallel layers corresponding to the planes of\r\ncleavage, those beautiful azure tints which characterize the veined\r\nstructure. So little has it to do with stratification, that in places\r\nwhere this is apparent it has given rise to a series of horizontal\r\nlines, while the parallel veinings, in the same masses of ice, are all\r\ninclined at an angle of about 60°.\r\n\r\nThe tendency to cleavage in compact ice would seem to explain the\r\nregular form of those fragments or detached pieces with which some\r\nparts of the glaciers are covered. Usually they occur as cubes, or\r\nas rectangular parallelopipeds. The Alpine mountaineers name them\r\n_séracs_,--in allusion to their resemblance to certain cheeses\r\nwhich bear this name, and which are manufactured in rectangular boxes.\r\nThey have been found in many parts of a really colossal size, measuring\r\nfifty feet in length, breadth, and depth, and as regular in shape as if\r\nthey had been hewn with a chisel.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many interesting points connected with the formation and\r\nconstitution of glaciers which we should gladly discuss, but we are\r\nconfined by our limits to remarks of a general character, and we must\r\nnow pass on to speak of the phenomena attendant upon their motion.\r\nNo doubt, the traveller who for the first time comes in sight of one\r\nof these huge ice-rivers, and sees the mighty mass apparently rooted\r\nto its valley-bed, solid, unchangeable, adamantine, finds it hard to\r\nbelieve that it moves onward with a certain and an unresting, though a\r\ngradual progress. It looks like a noble river, suddenly petrified by\r\nsome overwhelming force: congealed, as it flowed, in a moment, by some\r\nirresistible spell! Such, indeed, is the conception of the poet:--\r\n\r\n    “Ye ice-falls! ye that from the mountain’s brow\r\n    Adown enormous ravines slope amain....\r\n    Torrents, methinks, that heard a mighty voice,\r\n    And stopped at once amid their maddest plunge!\r\n    Motionless torrents! silent cataracts!”\r\n\r\nAnd this conception is justified by the _aspect_ of the glacier.\r\nThus, of the Glacier du Géant, Professor Tyndall says:--“It stretches\r\nsmoothly for a long distance, then becomes disturbed, and then changes\r\nto a great frozen cascade, down which the ice appears to tumble in\r\nwild confusion. Above the cascade you see an expanse of shining snow,\r\noccupying an area of some square miles.” But we shall see that here, as\r\nin the world of man, appearances are deceitful, and that the glacier\r\nwell deserves to be called an ice-river, in allusion to its regular and\r\ncontinuous motion.\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween the snow-fall in the higher regions of the globe, and the\r\nquantity of snow which every summer disappears through liquefaction,\r\nthe difference is very considerable. The supply, so to speak, exceeds\r\nthe demand, and a residuum is annually left. It is only below the\r\nperpetual snow-line that the snow created and accumulated in winter\r\nis wholly melted in the warm season. And, therefore, if for any\r\nconsiderable period the excess upon any particular mountain continued\r\nto accumulate, immense masses of ice would gradually rise to the\r\nextreme height in the atmosphere affected by aqueous phenomena.\r\n\r\nRendu, the Roman Catholic prelate, who first led the way to the\r\ndiscovery of the true nature of glaciers, says, very justly,--“The\r\neconomy of the world would be soon destroyed, if at certain points\r\naccumulations of matter prevailed. The centre of gravity of the globe\r\nwould be insensibly displaced, and the admirable regularity of its\r\nmovements would be succeeded by disorder and perturbation. If the Poles\r\ndid not send back to the Equatorial seas the waters which, reduced\r\ninto vapour, issue daily from these burning regions, to be converted\r\ninto ice in the Arctic and Antarctic Zones, ocean would be drained\r\ndry, and life would cease, as well as water, to circulate throughout\r\nour world. The Creator, however, in order to ensure the permanence of\r\nHis almighty work, has called into existence the vast and powerful law\r\nof circulation, and this law the careful observer sees reproduced in\r\nall the economy of Nature. The water circulates from the ocean into\r\nthe air, from the air it spreads over the earth, and from the earth\r\nit passes into the seas. The rivers return from whence they came, in\r\norder that they may issue forth anew; the air circulates around the\r\nglobe, and, as it were, upon itself, passing and repassing successively\r\nat all the altitudes of the atmospheric column. The elements of every\r\norganic substance circulates in changing from the solid to the liquid\r\nor aëriform state, and in returning from the latter to the state of\r\nsolidity or organization. It is not improbable that the universal\r\nagent which we designate under the name of fire, light, electricity,\r\nand magnetism, has probably also a circle of _circulation_ as\r\nextensive as the universe. Should its movements ever be known to us\r\nmore than they now are, it is probable that they would afford the\r\nsolution of a host of problems which still defy the intellect of man.\r\nCirculation is the law of life, the method of action employed by\r\nProvidence in the administration of the universe. In the insect, as\r\nin the plant, as in the human body, we find a circulation, or rather\r\nseveral circulations,--blood, humours, elements, fire, all which enter\r\ninto the composition of the individual.”\r\n\r\nHowever fanciful may be some of the amiable prelate’s speculations,\r\nit is certain that the glaciers obey this law of circulation. The\r\nsnow-accumulations in the upper regions are to some extent reduced by\r\nthe descent of the avalanches,--that is, of masses of snow and ice\r\nwhich detach themselves from the mountain-sides and dash headlong\r\ninto the valleys below, where they are rapidly melted by the warmer\r\natmosphere. But this would, in itself, be wholly insufficient. Another\r\nmovement, at once more efficacious and more regular, is necessary; a\r\nmovement which embraces the entire system of the ice-masses, and which\r\ncarries the glaciers below the perpetual snow-line, so that every year\r\nthey may give up a portion of their terminal extremities. The discovery\r\nof this general progression is one of the most fertile with which, of\r\nlate years, the physics of the globe have been enriched.\r\n\r\nProfessor Tyndall rightly observes that there are numerous obvious\r\nindications of the existence of glacier-motion, though it is too slow\r\nto catch the eye at once. The crevasses change within certain limits\r\nfrom year to year, and sometimes from month to month; and this could\r\nnot be if the ice did not move. Rocks and stones also are observed,\r\nwhich have been plainly torn from the mountain-sides. Blocks seen to\r\nfall from particular points are afterwards noticed lower down. On the\r\nmoraines rocks are found of a totally different mineralogical character\r\nfrom those composing the mountains right and left; and in all such\r\ncases strata of the same character are found bordering the glacier\r\nhigher up. Hence the conclusion that the foreign _boulders_ have\r\nbeen _floated_ down by the ice. Further, the ends or “snouts”\r\nof many glaciers act like ploughshares on the land in front of them,\r\noverturning with irresistible energy the huts and châlets that lie in\r\ntheir path. Facts like these have been long known to the inhabitants\r\nof the High Alps, who were thus made acquainted in a vague and general\r\nway with the motion of the glaciers. But Science cannot deal with\r\ngeneralities: it requires precise and accurate information; and this\r\ninformation, so far as the progression of the glaciers is concerned,\r\nhas been obtained through the patient labours of Rendu, Charpentier,\r\nAgassiz, Desor, Vogt, Professor Forbes, Bravais, Charles Martins,\r\nHopkins, Professor Tyndall, Colomb, John Ball, and Schlagintweit. Their\r\nexperiments and observations have established the truth of certain\r\nimmutable principles, and proved the existence of a general law of\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accumulation of the débris hurled headlong by the mountains forms\r\non the glacier-surface long lines of stone and earth, which are called\r\n_moraines_; these diverge in certain directions, according to the\r\ncircumstances we now come to explain.\r\n\r\nThe landslips which occur on the banks or edges of the glacier give\r\nrise to the _lateral moraines_, which are enlarged and extended\r\ndaily by the twofold effect of the fall of stones and débris, and the\r\nprogressive movement which carries them along with the whole mass of\r\nice. Towards the centre of the great glaciers, in almost every case,\r\nis found a _medial moraine_; the result of the encounter of the\r\nlateral moraines of two glaciers which have united into one. These\r\nsuperficial moraines participating in the movement of the glacier, each\r\nof their blocks eventually rolls to the foot of the terminal precipice,\r\nand thus a _frontal moraine_ is formed on the very soil of the\r\nvalley, like an embankment raised to prohibit the further advance of\r\nthe ice. And, lastly, the bed of sand, gravel, pebbles, and detritus\r\nwhich is found beneath the glacier, and over which it glides, is called\r\nthe _profound moraine_.\r\n\r\nThe furrows wrought by this last-named stratum on the bottom of the\r\nglacier-channels show the wonderful force of friction which the\r\nglacier exercises during its descent. The depths of these furrows\r\ndepends entirely on the hardness of the débris carried down by the\r\nglacier, and the nature of the rocks submitted to the friction. The\r\npolish assumed by these rocks when they are sufficiently solid to\r\nresist the thunderous march of the glacier, indicates the enormous\r\npressure which it exercises on the slopes of the valley through which\r\nit forces its way. This effort, bearing principally on the side of the\r\nrocks turned in the direction of their crests, impresses upon them\r\na peculiar rounded form, so like the appearance of a flock of sheep\r\n(_moutons_) that De Saussure gave them the name of _roches\r\nmoutonnées_.\r\n\r\nConnected with the scientific evidence of the progressive movement of\r\nglaciers, a glacier in the Bernese Oberland will for ever be memorable.\r\nTwo branch glaciers, the Lauteraar and the Finsteraar, unite at a\r\npromontory called the Abschwung to form the trunk-glacier of the\r\nUnteraar, which carries a great medial moraine along its colossal back.\r\n\r\nHere in 1827, an “intrepid and enthusiastic” Swiss professor, Hugi, of\r\nSolothurm (or Soleure), erected a small cabin of stones for the purpose\r\nof observations upon the glacier. The hut moved, and he took steps to\r\nmeasure its motion. In three years, 1827 to 1830, it moved 330 feet\r\ndownwards. In 1836 it had descended 2354 feet; and in 1841, it had\r\naccomplished a journey of 4712 feet. [This was at the rate of about 336\r\nfeet a year.]\r\n\r\nIn 1840, M. Agassiz, with some scientific friends, Messrs. Desor,\r\nVogt, and Nicolieb, established themselves under a great overhanging\r\nslab of rock on the same moraine, and by means of side walls, and\r\nother appliances, constructed a rough abode which, because some of\r\nthese men of science came from Neufchâtel, they named the “Hôtel des\r\nNeuchâtelois.”\r\n\r\nIn two years after its erection, Agassiz discovered that it had moved\r\ndownwards no less a distance than 486 feet.\r\n\r\nThese and some similar measurements brought to light a very important\r\nfact. The reader will observe that the _middle numbers_,\r\ncorresponding to the central portion of the glacier, are the\r\n_largest_: hence it was obvious that the _centre of a glacier,\r\nlike that of a river, moves more rapidly than the sides_.\r\n\r\n\r\nOwing to the greater central motion of a glacier, its crevasses\r\ninvariably assume a curved outline, of which the convexity advances\r\ntowards the bottom of the valley.\r\n\r\nIt has also been ascertained that the superficial part of a glacier\r\nmoves more rapidly than its base.\r\n\r\nAgain: Tyndall and Hirst, by employing instruments of great precision,\r\nhave demonstrated that the maximum of motion is not to be found exactly\r\nin the centre, but that, according to the windings of the valley\r\nthrough which the glacier flows, it moves sometimes to the right of\r\nthe centre, and sometimes to the left. Now, the progression of a river\r\nexhibits all the characters we have just enumerated, and the truth\r\nforeshadowed by Rendu has been confirmed in every detail. The glacier\r\n_is_ a “river of ice.”\r\n\r\nThe reader will naturally ask, How can a substance of such apparent\r\nrigidity as ice obey, as it _does_ obey, the same laws which\r\nregulate the movement of fluids? I can understand, he may say, how\r\nwater flows in such and such a manner: it is a liquid, and its\r\nmolecules are deficient in the property of cohesion; but that so solid,\r\nand firm, and unimpressible a substance as ice should be capable of\r\nmotion seems impossible. I can understand very easily that a mass of\r\nice, when loosened or detached from its resting-place, will glide\r\ndownwards until arrested by some adequate obstacle; but this is not\r\nthe kind of motion you are describing. According to your explanations,\r\nevery constituent portion of the glacier moves, and the central faster\r\nthan the lateral, and the surface faster than the base.\r\n\r\nThese objections were advanced by men of science when the motion of\r\nglaciers was first put forward as a theory; and the answer given by\r\nScheuchzer was, that a glacier might be compared, in the summer\r\nseason, to a sponge saturated with water, which, when afterwards\r\ncongealed by the cold temperature of autumn and winter, expanded, and\r\nproduced a dilatation of the mass in every direction. Then, as it could\r\nnot recede, as it could not _reascend_ its valley-slope, the\r\naugmentation of size would necessarily take place in its lower portion.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary for us to explain why this answer was unsatisfactory.\r\nSubsequent observations, however, proved its impossibility, and\r\nProfessor Forbes then put forward his ideas of the _viscous\r\ncharacter_ of ice. But these, too, did not meet the conditions of\r\nthe phenomenon; and the view now adopted is that of Professor Tyndall,\r\nwho has shown that it is the result of the regelation we have already\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nProfessor Forbes enunciated his theory in words to the following\r\neffect: “A glacier is an imperfect fluid or viscous body, which is\r\nurged down slopes of certain inclination by the natural pressure of\r\nits parts.” But we know the exceeding brittleness of ice, and how is\r\nviscosity compatible with brittleness? We know, too, that crevasses and\r\nfissures will suddenly form on a glacier, like the cracks on a pane of\r\nglass. But if ice were viscous, and could expand, dilate, or stretch\r\nas viscous substances do, these crevasses would be impossible. They\r\nwould gradually close up, like an indent in a mass of jelly. And yet it\r\ncannot be denied that a glacier _does_ move like a viscous body;\r\nthe centre flowing past the sides, the top flowing over the bottom,\r\nwhile the motion through a curved valley corresponds to fluid motion.\r\nHow are we to reconcile these apparently conflicting circumstances?\r\n\r\nBy Professor Tyndall’s regelation theory, which is founded on a fact\r\nalready mentioned; namely, that when two pieces of thawing ice are\r\nbrought in contact, they freeze together.\r\n\r\nThis _fact_, and its application irrespective of the _cause_\r\nof regelation, may be thus illustrated: “Saw two slabs from a block\r\nof ice, and bring their flat surfaces into contact; they immediately\r\nfreeze together. Two plates of ice, laid one upon the other, with\r\nflannel round them overnight, are sometimes so firmly frozen in the\r\nmorning that they will rather break elsewhere than along their surface\r\nof junction. If you enter one of the dripping ice-caves of Switzerland,\r\nyou have only to press for a moment a slab of ice against the roof of\r\nthe cave to cause it to freeze there and stick to the roof.\r\n\r\n“Place a number of fragments of ice in a basin of water, and cause them\r\nto touch each other; they freeze together where they touch. You can\r\nform a chain of such fragments; and then, by taking hold of one end of\r\nthe chain, you can draw the whole series after it. Chains of icebergs\r\nare sometimes formed in this way in the Arctic seas.”\r\n\r\nFrom these observations we deduce the following result:--Snow consists\r\nof small particles of ice. Now, if by pressure we squeeze out the air\r\nentangled in thawing snow, and bring the little ice-granules into close\r\ncontact, they may be expected, as they do, to freeze together; and\r\nshould the expulsion of the air be complete, the squeezed snow will\r\nassume the appearance of compact ice.\r\n\r\nIt is in this way that the consolidation of the snows takes place in\r\nthe Arctic as in the higher Alpine regions. The deeper layers of the\r\n_névé_ are converted into more or less perfect ice by the pressure\r\nof the superjacent layers; and further, they are made to assume the\r\nshape of the valley which they fill, by the slow and continuous\r\npressure of its sides.\r\n\r\nIn glaciers, as Professor Tyndall points out, we have ample\r\nillustrations of rude fracture and regelation; as, for example, in\r\nthe opening and closing of crevasses. The glacier is broken on the\r\ncascades, and mended at their bases. When two branch glaciers lay their\r\nsides together, the regelation is so firm that they begin immediately\r\nto flow in the trunk glacier as in a single stream. The medial moraine\r\ngives no indication by its slowness of motion that it is derived from\r\nthe sluggish ice of the sides of the branch glaciers.\r\n\r\nWe may sum up the regelation theory in few words. The ice of glaciers\r\nchanges its form and retains its continuity under _pressure_ which\r\nkeeps its particles together. But when subjected to _tension_,\r\nsooner than stretch, it _breaks_, and behaves no longer as a\r\nviscous body.\r\n\r\nThese are Professor Tyndall’s words, and the fact which they embody it\r\nwould be difficult to set forth more clearly or more concisely.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A POLAR GLACIER.]\r\n\r\nHaving said thus much of the structure, causes, characteristics,\r\nand movement of glaciers, we proceed to consider some of the more\r\nremarkable of those which are situated in the Arctic World.\r\n\r\nThe glaciers of the Polar Regions do not differ in structure or mode\r\nof formation from those of other countries. Yet they possess some\r\npeculiar features, and to a superficial observer might seem independent\r\nof the physical laws we have attempted to explain. That this is not\r\nthe case has been shown by Charles Martins, who carefully studied the\r\nglaciers of Spitzbergen on the occasion of the exploring voyage of\r\nthe _Recherche_ to that island, and has demonstrated that their\r\ndifferences are but a particular case of the general phenomenon.\r\n\r\nAs special characters he points out, first, the rarity of needles and\r\nprisms of ice, which he attributes to the slight inclination and the\r\nuniformity of the slopes, as well as to the diminution of the solar\r\nheat, which, even in the long summer days, does not melt the surface.\r\nThere are no rills or streams capable of hollowing out crevasses and\r\nmoulding protuberances or projections. But transversal crevasses\r\nproduced by the movement of the glaciers are numerous, and these are\r\noften very wide and very deep.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: GLACIER, ENGLISH BAY, SPITZBERGEN.]\r\n\r\nIn the terminal escarpment, which melts in proportion as it plunges\r\ninto the sea, immense caverns are sometimes seen; caverns so immense\r\nthat the azure-gleaming grottoes of the Arveiron and Grindelwald, so\r\nmuch admired by European travellers, are but miniatures. “One day,”\r\nsays Charles Martins, “after having ascertained the temperature of the\r\nsea off the great glacier of Bell Sound, I proposed to the sailors\r\nwho accompanied me to carry our boat into its cavern. I explained to\r\nthem the risk we should incur, being unwilling to attempt anything\r\nwithout their consent. When our boat had crossed the threshold, we\r\nfound ourselves in an immense Gothic cathedral; long conical-pointed\r\ncylinders of ice descended from the roof; the recesses seemed so many\r\nchapels opening out of the principal nave; broad fissures divided\r\nthe walls, and the open intervals, like arches, sprang towards the\r\nsummits; azure gleams played over the icy surface, and were reflected\r\nin the water. The sailors, like myself, were dumb with admiration.\r\nBut a too prolonged contemplation would have been dangerous; we soon\r\nregained the narrow opening through which we had penetrated into this\r\nwinter temple, and, returning on board our vessel, preserved a discreet\r\nsilence respecting an escapade which might have been justly blamed. In\r\nthe evening, we saw from the shore our cathedral of the morning slowly\r\nbend forwards, detach itself from the parent glacier, crash into the\r\nwaves, and reappear in a thousand blocks and fragments of ice, which\r\nthe retiring tide carried slowly out to sea.”\r\n\r\nThe Spitzbergen glaciers do not exhibit those numerous moraines which\r\nare observed on the majority of those of Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThe mountains, not being very lofty, are buried, as it were, under\r\ntheir burden of glaciers, instead of preponderating over them, and seem\r\nwith difficulty to lift their peaks out of the mass of ice and snow\r\nsurrounding them. Consequently, there are no considerable landslips\r\nor falls of earth and stone, which, accumulating along the borders\r\nof the glaciers, might form moraines. Martins is of opinion that the\r\nSpitzbergen glaciers correspond to the upper part of the glaciers of\r\nSwitzerland; to so much, that is to say, as lies above the perpetual\r\nsnow-line.\r\n\r\nNow, he says, the higher we ascend on an Alpine glacier, the more do\r\nthe lateral and medial moraines diminish in width and form, until\r\nthey taper away and finally disappear under the high _névés_ of\r\nthe amphitheatres from which the glacier issues, just as the mountain\r\ntorrents often take their rise in one or in several lakes terraced one\r\nabove the other.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: GLACIER, BELL SOUND, SPITZBERGEN.]\r\n\r\nFor all these reasons, he adds, the medial and lateral moraines are\r\nscarcely conspicuous on the glaciers of Spitzbergen; a number of stones\r\nand boulders may be seen along their sides, and sometimes in their\r\ncentre, but the ice is never hidden, as in the Alps, under the mass of\r\ndébris accumulated upon it. As for the terminal moraines, they must be\r\nsought at the bottom of the sea, since the terminal escarpment nearly\r\nalways overhangs it. Hence, the blocks of stone fall simultaneously\r\nwith the blocks of ice, and form a submarine frontal moraine, of which\r\nthe two extremities are occasionally visible upon the shore.\r\n\r\nIn a previous chapter we have alluded to the manner in which icebergs\r\nare formed by the detachment from the seaward extremity of the glacier\r\nof huge masses of ice, which the current carries out into the open\r\nsea. To the description already given, we may here add that which\r\nCharles Martins furnishes in his valuable and interesting record of\r\npersevering scientific enterprise, “Du Spitzberg au Sahara”:--In\r\nSpitzbergen, he says, the glacier, after a traject of more or less\r\nconsiderable duration, reaches the sea. If the shore be rectilineal,\r\nit advances no further; but, in the recess of a bay, where the shore\r\nis curved, it continues its progression, supporting its bulk on the\r\nsides of the bay, and advancing above the water, which it overhangs.\r\nThis is easily understood. In summer the sea-water at the bottom of\r\nthe bays is always at a temperature a little above 32°; on coming in\r\ncontact with this comparatively warm water the glacier melts, and, at\r\nlow tide, an interval is perceptible between the ice and the surface of\r\nthe water. The glacier being no longer supported, partially crumbles\r\nand gives way; immense blocks detach themselves, fall into the sea,\r\ndisappear beneath the water, reappear revolving on their own axes, and\r\noscillate for a few moments until they have taken up their position of\r\nequilibrium. The blocks thus detached from the floating masses, of all\r\nsizes and shapes, are called icebergs.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: STEAMER “CHARGING” AN ICEBERG, UPERNAVIK,\r\n  GREENLAND.]\r\n\r\nOur traveller records that twice a day, in Magdalena Bay and Bell\r\nSound, he was an eye-witness of this partial ruin of the extremity\r\nof the glaciers. Their fall was accompanied by a noise like that\r\nof thunder; the swollen sea rushed upon the shore in a succession of\r\ngigantic waves; the gulf was covered with icebergs, which, caught in\r\nthe swirl and eddy, issued out of the bay, like immense fleets, to gain\r\nthe sea beyond, or were stranded here and there at points where the\r\nwater was shallow. The icebergs seen by M. Martins were not, however,\r\nof any surprising magnitude; he estimates their average height at\r\nthirteen to sixteen feet. We have seen that those of Baffin Bay are\r\ntenfold more considerable and imposing; but then, in that bay the\r\ntemperature of the sea is below 32°; the glacier does not melt when it\r\nenters the water; it sinks to the bottom of the sea; and the portions\r\ndetached from it are all of greater height than even the submerged\r\npart of the icebergs which drift to and fro in the bays and gulfs of\r\nSpitzbergen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe may follow up this description with some observations by Lieutenant\r\nBellot, the chivalrous young Frenchman who perished in one of the\r\nexpeditions despatched in search of Sir John Franklin and his\r\ncompanions. He is speaking of the masses of ice his ship encountered\r\nsoon after doubling Cape Farewell, the south point of Greenland,\r\nand he remarks, that as Baffin Bay narrows towards the south, the\r\nicebergs, first set in motion higher up the bay by the northern gales,\r\nnecessarily tend to accumulate in the gorge thus formed, and so to\r\nimpede and block up Davis Strait, even when the higher waters are quite\r\nfree. It is only through a series of alternate movements of advance and\r\nrecession that the bergs finally pass beyond the barrier, and float out\r\ninto the Atlantic, to undergo a slow process of dissolution.\r\n\r\nThe mobility of the bergs, though necessary to navigation, forms at\r\nthe same time its peculiar danger, since a vessel is often placed\r\nbetween the shore and the colossal masses driven forward by the wind,\r\nor between these and the solid ice which as yet has not broken up. It\r\nis useless to dwell upon the immense force possessed by masses which\r\nare frequently several square leagues in extent, and which, once in\r\nmovement, cannot be stayed by any human resistance. A sailing-vessel\r\nfinds herself placed in conditions all the more unfavourable, because\r\nthe winds blow from the very direction which she is bound to take in\r\norder to open up a way through the floes. Now, if the gale is violent,\r\nit is perilous indeed to push forward in the midst of a labyrinth of\r\nbergs, which form so many floating rocks; if a calm prevails, a ship\r\ncan move forward only by laborious hauling or towed by the boats.\r\nThe application of the screw-propeller to steam-ships has given to\r\nthem a great superiority, because they are not liable to any accident\r\nto paddle-wheels, exposed as such must be to collision with the\r\nfloating ice. It is recorded that, on one occasion, a screw-steamer,\r\nnear Upernavik, on the coast of Greenland, actually _charged_\r\nan iceberg, and drove right through it, as a railway-engine might\r\ncrash through a fence or hurdle. Of course, the berg was of no great\r\nelevation; but its solid mass yielded to the immense force of the\r\nsteamship, and split into large fragments.\r\n\r\nIn the convulsions caused by furious tempests, which are far from\r\nbeing so rare within the Arctic Circle as is popularly supposed, the\r\nshape of the bergs becomes very irregular, and the configuration of\r\nthe ice-fields is constantly undergoing modification. Hence it often\r\nhappens that the voyager sees before him an open basin of water of\r\ngreater or less extent, from which he is separated only by a narrow\r\nstrip of ice. In such a case he endeavours to effect an opening, either\r\nby driving his ship at full speed against the weakest part of the ice,\r\nor with the help of immense saws, twenty feet in length, which are\r\nworked with a rope and pulley placed at the top of a triangle formed\r\nof long poles; or, finally, by exploding a mine. When the ice is not\r\nvery solid, the ship is forced into the opening, against the sides of\r\nwhich it acts like a wedge. It will sometimes occur, in the course of\r\nthe operation, that the ice-fields, set in motion by the wind or the\r\ncurrents, close in together, after having treacherously separated for\r\na moment, and the vessel is then subjected to a dangerous pressure.\r\nUnhappy the mariner who does not foresee or sufficiently note the\r\nwarning signs of this accident, which is almost always accompanied\r\nby fatal consequences. The ice, which nothing can check, passing\r\nunderneath the ship, capsizes it,--or, if it resists, crushes it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have alluded to the colossal bergs of Baffin Bay. These are thrown\r\noff from the northern glaciers, and particularly from the enormous\r\nice-river named after Humboldt, which cumbers the declivities of the\r\nGreenland Alps, beyond the 79th parallel. It has been a frequent\r\nsource of surprise to navigators that these mighty masses should\r\nfloat in a contrary direction to that of the ice-fields which descend\r\nwith the Polar current towards the Atlantic. They reascend with such\r\nrapidity that they shatter the so-called “ice-foot,” or belt of ice,\r\nstill adhering to the shore. Captain Maury has collected numerous\r\nobservations on this important subject, and he quotes the case of a\r\nship which was being laboriously hauled against the current, when an\r\nenormous floating mountain coming up from the south steered against\r\nit, but fortunately did not come into collision with it, and forging\r\nahead, very quickly disappeared. How is such an incident to be\r\nexplained? By the existence of a submarine counter-current, acting on\r\nthe lower extremity of the submerged portion of the berg, which, as\r\nwe have stated, is always seven or eight times larger than the bulk\r\n_above_ the surface of the waves.\r\n\r\nOur whalers, in their hazardous expeditions, often derive assistance\r\nfrom these moving islands. They seek shelter under their lee when\r\nsudden storms arise; for the huge bergs are scarcely affected by the\r\nmost violent gales. They find their shelter valuable also during\r\ncertain operations of the fishery for which rest and quiet are\r\nnecessary. Yet it is not absolutely exempt from danger. The seeming\r\nfriend may prove to be a concealed foe. The iceberg may collapse,\r\nor be capsized; or formidable fragments, loosened from their sides\r\nor summits, may topple headlong and threaten to overwhelm the ship\r\nbeneath: but as on these and other accidents we have already dwelt at\r\nlength, we refrain from wearying our readers with a twice-told tale.\r\nThe repetition in which, to some extent, we have indulged, was needful,\r\nin order to show the reader in what way the dissolution of the lower\r\nextremity of the glaciers is effected in the Arctic world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Cape Alexander, one of the headlands of Smith\r\nStrait, Dr. Hayes met with a glacier, of which he gives an interesting\r\ndescription in his narrative of an “Arctic Boat Journey,” (1854):--\r\n\r\nIt was the first, protruding into the ocean, which he had had an\r\nopportunity of inspecting closely; and though small, compared with\r\nother similar formations, it had nevertheless all their principal\r\ncharacteristics. It presented to the sea a convex mural face, seventy\r\nfeet in height and about two miles in length, its centre projecting\r\ninto the water beyond the general line of the coast to the east and\r\nwest of it. The surface rose abruptly to the height of about two\r\nhundred feet, and, sloping thence backward with a gentle inclination,\r\nseemed to be connected with an extensive _mer de glace_ above.\r\nSeveral fissures or crevasses, apparently of great depth, struck\r\nvertically through its body, and extended far up into its interior;\r\nand others, more shallow, which seemed to have been formed by the\r\nstreams of melted snow that poured in cataracts down into the sea. Dr.\r\nHayes remarks that he was impressed by its viscous appearance; but we\r\nhave shown that a certain amount of viscosity naturally appertains to\r\nglacier ice.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FORCING A PASSAGE THROUGH THE ICE.]\r\n\r\nParallel with its convex face ran a succession of indistinctly marked\r\nlines, which gave it the aspect of a semi-fluid mass moving downward\r\nupon an inclined surface; and this idea was confirmed by its appearance\r\nabout the rocks on either side. Over these it seemed to have flowed;\r\nand, fitting accurately into all their inequalities, it gave the effect\r\nof a huge moving mass of partially solidified matter suddenly congealed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf still greater interest is the same adventurous explorer’s\r\ndescription of the great Arctic _Mer de Glace_ which lies inland\r\nfrom Rensselaer Bay, in about lat. 79° N., and long. 68° W.\r\n\r\nDr. Hayes and his party had set out on an expedition into the interior,\r\nand after passing through a really picturesque landscape, enriched with\r\nbeds of moss and turf, patches of purple andromeda, and the trailing\r\nbranches of the dwarf-willow, they emerged upon a broad plain or\r\nvalley, in the heart of which reposed a frozen lake, about two miles in\r\nlength by half a mile in width. They traversed its transparent surface.\r\nOn either side of them rose rugged bluffs, that stretched off into long\r\nlines of hills, culminating in series in a broad-topped mountain-ridge,\r\nwhich, running away to right and left, was cut by a gap several miles\r\nwide that opened directly before them. Immediately in front was a low\r\nhill, around the base of which flowed on either side the branches\r\nof a stream whose course they had followed. Leaving the river-bed\r\njust above the lake, they climbed to the summit of this hillock; and\r\nthere a sight burst upon them, grand and imposing beyond the power of\r\nwords adequately to describe. From the rocky bed, only a few miles\r\nin advance, a sloping wall of pure whiteness rose to a broad level\r\nplain of ice, which, apparently without limits, stretched away toward\r\nthe unknown east. It was the great _mer de glace_ of the Arctic\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nHere then was, in reality, the counterpart of the river-systems of\r\nother lands. From behind the granite hills the congealed drainings of\r\nthe interior water-sheds, the atmospheric precipitations of ages, were\r\nmoving in a mass, which, though solid, was plastic, moving down through\r\nevery gap in the mountains, swallowing up the rocks, filling the\r\nvalleys, submerging the hills: an onward, irresistible, crystal tide,\r\nswelling to the ocean. The surface was intersected by numerous vertical\r\ncrevasses, some of considerable depth, which had drained off the melted\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\nIt was midnight when the explorers approached this colossal reservoir.\r\nThe sun was several degrees beneath the horizon, and afforded a faint\r\ntwilight-gleam. Stars of the second magnitude were dimly perceptible in\r\nthe cold, steel-blue Arctic heavens. When they were within about half\r\na mile of the icy wall, a brilliant meteor fell before them, and, by\r\nits reflection upon the glassy surface beneath, greatly increased the\r\nmagical effect of the scene; while loud reports, like distant thunder\r\nor the roll of artillery, broke at intervals from the depths of the\r\nfrozen sea.\r\n\r\nOn closer inspection it was found that the face of the glacier ascended\r\nat an angle of from 30° to 35°. At its base lay a high bank of snow,\r\nand the wanderers clambered up it about sixty feet; but beyond this\r\ntheir efforts were defied by the exceeding smoothness of the ice.\r\nThe mountains, which stood on either hand like giant-warders, were\r\noverlapped, and to some extent submerged, by the glacier. From the\r\nface of the huge ice-river innumerable little rivulets ran down the\r\nchannels their action had gradually excavated, or gurgled from beneath\r\nthe ice; forming, on the level lands below, a sort of marsh, not twenty\r\nyards from the icy wall. Here, in strange contrast, bloomed beds of\r\nverdurous moss; and in these, tufts of dwarf-willows were wreathing\r\ntheir tiny arms and rootlets about the feebler flower-growths; and\r\nthere, clustered together, crouching among the grass, and sheltered\r\nby the leaves, and feeding on the bed of lichens, flourished a tiny,\r\nwhite-blossomed draba and a white chickweed. Dotting the few feet of\r\ngreen around might be seen the yellow flowers of the more hardy poppy,\r\nthe purple potentilla, and saxifrages yellow, purple, and white.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe great glacier of Sermiatsialik is one of the arms, or outlets, of\r\nthis immense reservoir of ice. It occupies the bed of a valley, varying\r\nfrom three and a half to five miles in width, and attaining at certain\r\npoints a depth of upwards of three hundred and seventy feet. This\r\nvalley opens upon the fiord of Sermiatsialik, which is separated from\r\nthat of Julianshaab by the range of mountains culminating in the peak\r\nof Redkammen.\r\n\r\nWe owe to Dr. Hayes a lively description of the Sermiatsialik glacier,\r\nwhich he thinks must at some places be more than seven hundred and\r\nfifty feet in depth, overflowing the borders of the valley like a\r\nswollen torrent. For upwards of four leagues, the icebergs which throng\r\nthe fiord, or gulf, are those of the glacier itself, and terminating\r\nin a wedge-like outline, disappear in the vast sea of ice expanding to\r\nright and left above the loftiest summits, and drawing irresistibly the\r\neye to its rippled surface,--boundless, apparently, like that of ocean.\r\nAs the voyager sails up the gulf, he gradually loses sight of the\r\nfrozen slope, and then of the white line of the _mer de glace_:\r\nhe finds himself in front of an immense cliff, from one hundred to\r\ntwo hundred feet in height, diaphanous as the purest crystals, and\r\nreflecting all the hues of heaven.\r\n\r\nOne almost shudders as one approaches this vast domain of Winter.\r\nCollecting in copious streams, the ice and snow melted on the surface\r\nof the glacier pour over its brink, forming floating clouds of spray,\r\nirradiated by rainbow colours. The din of these cascades fills the\r\nair. At intervals, the loud reports of the internal convulsions of the\r\nglacier are repeated by every echo.\r\n\r\nThe cliff is entirely vertical; but its face, far from being smooth,\r\nis broken up into an infinite variety of forms: into unfathomable\r\ncavernous hollows, symmetrical spires, ogives, pinnacles, and deep\r\nfissures, where the eye plunges into a transparent blue, which changes\r\nevery second its fleeting, opaline tints; tints so soft, and yet so\r\nvivid, that they defy the skill of the artist to reproduce them. The\r\nlustre of the “dark eye of woman” is not more difficult to seize. A\r\ndeep dark green, less delicate but not less splendid, colours all the\r\nrecesses where the ice overhangs the waters. In the sunlight one sees\r\nthe surface of these huge crystals shining with the whiteness of the\r\npurest snow; except, indeed, where recent fractures have taken place.\r\nThey suggest to the mind the idea of the gleams and reflections of\r\na piece of satin; the undulatory lustre and shifting sparkle being\r\nproduced by the different angles under which the light is reflected.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut let us suppose that we have landed; with much difficulty have\r\nascended the cliffs; and have clambered up the glacier to its very\r\nsummit. The scene before us, how shall we convey to the mind of the\r\nreader?\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE GLACIER OF SERMIATSIALIK, GREENLAND.]\r\n\r\nImagine, if you can, the rapids of the Upper Niagara congealed even\r\nto their lowest depths; imagine the falls, and the broad river, and\r\nthe great Lake Erie all frozen into solid ice; with bergs above the\r\ncataract towering as high as the lower banks: suppose that you, the\r\nspectator, having taken your stand upon the rapids, with the Erie so\r\nnear that you can see its crystallized surface, and you will have a\r\npicture, on a reduced scale, of the sea of ice now spreading far before\r\nus. The rapids will represent the glacier; the Great Fall the cliff\r\nwhich it projects into the sea (only that the celebrated “horse-shoe”\r\nis here turned outwards); the river which broadens into the Ontario\r\nwill be the fiord; and the Ontario, that dark grim ocean into which the\r\ngigantic bergs detached from the mighty ice-cascade are slowly making\r\ntheir way!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe must indicate, however, one remarkable dissimilarity, for which our\r\nprevious observations on the nature of glaciers will have prepared the\r\nreader. From one bank to the other, the surface of a river is always\r\n_horizontal_, but that of a glacier is slightly _convex_.\r\n\r\nThrough the narrow glen, or ravine, formed by this curvature of the\r\nglacier, a kind of lateral trough or gully, bounded by the escarpment\r\nof the soil, we reach the sea. The descent is not without its dangers,\r\nfor at every point crevasses open, separated by slippery projections.\r\nThese deep gashes, at some points, are only a few yards apart; and they\r\nincessantly cross each other, and run into one another, so as to form a\r\nperfect labyrinth, in the windings of which the adventurous traveller\r\nis apt to feel bewildered.\r\n\r\nThe border of the glacier once crossed, the way becomes less difficult;\r\nfor a mile and a half the level is almost perfect, and the ice but\r\nlittle broken up. The frozen desert, however, impresses us with\r\nan almost solemn feeling, and there is something terrible in the\r\ndesolation of such a Sahara of snow!\r\n\r\nMoreover, the traveller is irresistibly affected by the continual roar\r\nor growling of the enormous mass, which seems to stir and shake under\r\nour very feet. He would not be surprised if a vast chasm suddenly\r\nyawned before him! These harsh deep voices of the glacier, however, are\r\nnot the only sounds we hear. On every side rises the murmur of brooks\r\nwhich trace their furrows across the crystalline plain. Some of these\r\ngradually converge, and, uniting, form a considerable torrent, which\r\nleaps with a clang from icy crag to icy ledge, until it is lost in a\r\ncrevasse, or precipitated over the frozen cliff into the waters of\r\nthe fiord. The _solitude_ of the scene is complete, but not the\r\n_silence_. The air is as full of “noises” as ever was Prospero’s\r\nisle.\r\n\r\nSuch are the principal features of the glacier of Sermiatsialik.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAbout ninety miles north-east of Rensselaer Bay lies the great Humboldt\r\nGlacier, which seems to serve as a connecting-link between the Old\r\nWorld and the New.\r\n\r\nIt lies between the 79th and 80th parallels north, and between the 64th\r\nand 65th meridians west, skirting the shore of Peabody Bay, which is a\r\nbold indentation of the east coast of Kane Sea.\r\n\r\nIt was discovered in Dr. Kane’s expedition, and is probably one of the\r\ngrandest spectacles in the Arctic world. Dr. Kane acknowledges himself\r\nunable to do justice to its magnificent aspect. He can speak only of\r\nits “long, ever-shining line of cliff diminished to a well-pointed\r\nwedge in the perspective;” of its “face of glistening ice, sweeping\r\nin a long curve from the low interior, the facets in front intensely\r\nilluminated by the sun.”\r\n\r\nThis line of cliff rises, like a solid wall of glass, three hundred\r\nfeet above the water-level, with an unknown, unfathomable depth below\r\nit; and its curved face, _sixty miles in length_, disappears into\r\nunknown space at not more than a single day’s railroad-travel from\r\nthe Pole. The interior with which it communicates, and from which\r\nit issues, is an unexplored _mer de glace_, an ice-ocean, of\r\napparently boundless dimensions.\r\n\r\nSuch is the “mighty crystal bridge” which connects the two continents\r\nof America and Greenland. We say, continents; for Greenland, as Dr.\r\nKane remarks, however insulated it may ultimately prove to be, is in\r\nmass strictly continental. Its least possible axis, measured from Cape\r\nFarewell to the line of the Humboldt Glacier, in the neighbourhood\r\nof the 80th parallel, gives a length of upwards of twelve hundred\r\nmiles,--not materially less than that of Australia from its northern to\r\nits southern cape.\r\n\r\nImagine the centre of such a continent, says Dr. Kane, occupied through\r\nnearly its whole extent by a deep, unbroken sea of ice, that gathers\r\nperennial increase from the watershed of vast snow-covered mountains\r\nand all the precipitations of the atmosphere upon its own surface.\r\nImagine this, moving onward like a great glacial river, seeking outlets\r\nat every fiord and valley, rolling icy cataracts into the Atlantic and\r\nGreenland seas; and, having at last reached the northern limit of the\r\nland that has borne it up, pouring out a mighty frozen torrent into\r\nunknown Arctic space.\r\n\r\n“It is thus,” remarks Dr. Kane, “and only thus, that we must form a\r\njust conception of a phenomenon like this great glacier. I had looked\r\nin my own mind for such an appearance, should I ever be fortunate\r\nenough to reach the northern coast of Greenland. But now that it was\r\nbefore me, I could hardly realize it. I had recognized, in my quiet\r\nlibrary at home, the beautiful analogies which Forbes and Studer have\r\ndeveloped between the glacier and the river; but I could not comprehend\r\nat first this complete substitution of ice for water.\r\n\r\n“It was slowly the conviction dawned on me that I was looking upon the\r\ncounterpart of the great river-system of Arctic Asia and America. Yet\r\nhere were no water-feeders from the south. Every particle of moisture\r\nhad its origin within the Polar Circle, and had been converted into\r\nice. There were no vast alluvions, no forest or animal traces borne\r\ndown by liquid torrents. Here was a plastic, moving, semi-solid mass,\r\nobliterating life, swallowing rocks and islands, and ploughing its way\r\nwith irresistible march through the crust of an investing sea.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen, at a later period, Dr. Kane made a closer examination of this\r\ngreat natural wonder, he found that previously he had not realized\r\nthe full grandeur of the spectacle. He noted that the trend of the\r\nglacier was a few degrees to the west of north; and he remarks, as the\r\npeculiarity of its aspect, that it did not indicate _repose_, but\r\nactivity, energy, movement.\r\n\r\nIts surface seemed to follow that of the basis-country over which\r\nit flowed. It was undulating on and about the horizon, but as it\r\ndescended towards the sea it represented a broken plain with a general\r\ninclination of some nine degrees, still diminishing toward the\r\nforeground. Crevasses, which in the distance seemed like mere wrinkles,\r\nexpanded as they came nearer, and were intersected almost at right\r\nangles by long continuous lines of fracture parallel with the face of\r\nthe glacier.\r\n\r\nThese lines, too, scarcely perceptible in the far distance, widened\r\nas they approached the sea until they formed a gigantic stairway. It\r\nseemed as though the ice had lost its support below, and that the mass\r\nwas let down from above in a series of steps; and such an action is\r\nthe necessary result of the heat thrown out by the soil, the excessive\r\nsurface-drainage, and the constant abrasion of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe indication of a great propelling agency seemed to be just\r\ncommencing at the time that Dr. Kane visited the great glacier. The\r\nsplit-off lines of ice were evidently in motion, pressed on by those\r\nbehind, but still broadening their fissures, as if the impelling action\r\ngrew more and more energetic nearer the water, till at last they\r\nfloated away in the form of icebergs. Long files of these detached\r\nmasses might be seen, like the ranks of a stately armada, slowly\r\nsailing out into the remote sea, their separation marked by dark\r\nparallel shadows; broad and spacious avenues near the eye, but narrowed\r\nin the perspective to mere furrows. A more impressive illustration of\r\nthe forces of nature it would be difficult to conceive.\r\n\r\nDr. Kane’s view of the formation of icebergs differs considerably from\r\nthat which most physicists entertain.\r\n\r\nHe does not believe that the berg falls into the sea, broken by its\r\nweight from the parent glacier; he is of opinion that it _rises\r\nfrom_ the sea. The process is at once gradual and comparatively\r\nquiet. “The idea of icebergs being discharged, so universal among\r\nsystematic writers, seems to me at variance with the regulated and\r\nprogressive actions of Nature. Developed by such a process, the\r\nthousands of bergs which throng the Polar seas should keep the air\r\nand water in perpetual commotion, one fearful succession of explosive\r\ndetonations and propagated waves. But it is only the lesser masses\r\nfalling into deep waters which could justify the popular opinion. The\r\nenormous masses of the great glacier are propelled, step by step and\r\nyear by year, until, reaching water capable of supporting them, they\r\nare floated off to be lost in the temperatures of other regions.”\r\n\r\nThe Humboldt Glacier did not differ in structure from the Alpine\r\nand Norwegian ice-growths; and its face presented nearly all the\r\ncharacteristic features of the latter. The _overflow_, or viscous\r\noverlapping of the surface, was very strongly marked. “When close to\r\nthe island rocks,” says Kane, “and looking out upon the upper table of\r\nthe glacier, I was struck with the homely analogy of the batter-cake\r\nspreading itself out under the ladle of the housewife, the upper\r\nsurface less affected by friction, and rolling forward in consequence.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe crevasses bore the marks of direct fracture, as well as of the\r\nmore gradual action of surface-drainage. The extensive watershed\r\nbetween their converging planes gave to the icy surface most of the\r\nhydrographic features of a river-system. The ice-born rivers which\r\ndivided them were margined occasionally with spires of discoloured\r\nice, and generally lost themselves in the central areas of the glacier\r\nbefore reaching its foreground. Occasionally, too, the face of the\r\nglacier was cut by vertical lines, which, as in the Alpine examples,\r\nwere evidently outlets for the surface drainage.\r\n\r\nThe height of this ice-wall at the nearest point was about three\r\nhundred feet, measured from the water’s edge; and the unbroken\r\nright line of its diminishing perspective showed that this might be\r\nregarded as its constant measurement. It seemed, in fact, a great icy\r\ntable-land, abutting with a clean precipice against the sea. This,\r\nindeed, is the great characteristic of all those Arctic glaciers which\r\nissue from central reservoirs or _mers de glace_ upon the fiords\r\nor bays, and is strikingly in contrast with the dependent or hanging\r\nglacier of the ravines, where every line and furrow and chasm seem to\r\nindicate the movement of descent and the mechanical disturbances which\r\nhave impeded and delayed it.\r\n\r\nDr. Kane named this monster glacier after Alexander Von Humboldt,\r\nto whose labours Physical Science is so largely indebted; and the\r\ncape which flanks it on the Greenland coast after the distinguished\r\nnaturalist, whom the world has so recently lost, Professor Agassiz.\r\n\r\nThe point at which the Humboldt Glacier enters the “Land of Washington”\r\naffords even at a distance very clear indications of its plastic or\r\nsemi-solid character. The observer finds it impossible to resist the\r\nimpression of fluidity conveyed by its peculiar markings. Dr. Kane\r\nvery appropriately named it Cape Forbes, in honour of the illustrious\r\nson of Scotia who contributed so largely to our true knowledge of the\r\nstructure and mode of progression of glaciers.\r\n\r\nAs the surface of the glacier, adds its discoverer, receded to the\r\nsouth, its face seemed broken with piles of earth and rock-stained\r\nrubbish, until far back in the interior it was concealed from view by\r\nthe slope of a hill. But even beyond this point its continued extension\r\nwas shown by the white glare or ice-blink in the sky above.\r\n\r\nIts outline to the northward could not be so easily traced, on account\r\nof the enormous discharges at its base. The talus of its descent from\r\nthe interior, looking far off to the east, ranged from 7° to 15°; so\r\ninterrupted by the crevasses, however, as only in the distance to\r\nproduce the effect of an inclined plane. A few black protuberances rose\r\nabove the glittering surface of the snow, like islands in a foamy sea.\r\n\r\nIt could be seen, from the general inequalities of its surface,\r\nhow well the huge mass adapted itself to the inequalities of the\r\nbasis-country beneath. The same modifications of hill and dale were\r\ndiscernible as upon land. Thus grand and various in its imposing\r\naspect, it stretches to the north until it touches the new Land of\r\nWashington, cementing together by an apparently indissoluble tie the\r\nGreenland of the Norse Vikings and the America of the Anglo-Saxon\r\ncolonists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n      THE ARCTIC LANDS--FAUNA--FLORA--GREENLAND--ICELAND--NOVAIA\r\n                           ZEMLAIA--SIBERIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already pointed out that in the northernmost regions of the\r\nArctic lands the year is divided into one prolonged and bitterly cold\r\nnight of several months’ duration, and one glorious summer’s day\r\nextending over nine or ten weeks, which brings the scanty vegetation\r\nto a sudden maturity. We have indicated that even within the limits of\r\nperpetual snow the life of Nature is not altogether crushed out; and in\r\nsupport of this statement we may refer to the “red snow” which figures\r\nso often in the pages of our Arctic voyagers, though its true character\r\nwas not at first apprehended.\r\n\r\nThis so-called “red snow” was found by Sir John Ross, in his first\r\nArctic expedition in 1808, on a range of cliffs rising about 800 feet\r\nabove the sea-level, and extending eight miles in length (lat. 75° N.).\r\nIt was also discovered by Sir W. E. Parry in his overland expedition in\r\n1827. The snow was tinged to the depth of several inches. Moreover, if\r\nthe surface of the snow-plain, though previously of its usual spotless\r\npurity, was crushed by the pressure of the sledges and of the footsteps\r\nof the party, blood-like stains instantly arose; the impressions being\r\nsometimes of an orange hue, and sometimes more like a pale salmon tint.\r\n\r\nIt has been ascertained that this singular variation of colour is\r\ndue to an immense aggregation of minute plants of the species called\r\n_Protococcus nivalis_; the generic name alluding to the extreme\r\nprimitiveness of its organization, and the specific to the peculiar\r\nnature of its habitat. If we place a small quantity of red snow on a\r\npiece of white paper, and allow it to melt and evaporate, there will be\r\nleft a residuum of granules sufficient to communicate a faint crimson\r\ntint to the paper. Examine these granules under a microscope, and\r\nthey will prove to be spherical purple cells of almost inappreciable\r\nsize, not more than the three-thousandth to one-thousandth part of\r\nan inch in diameter. Look more closely, and you will see that each\r\ncell has an opening, surrounded by indented or serrated lines, the\r\nsmallest diameter of which measures only the five-thousandth part of\r\nan inch. When perfect, the plant, as Dr. Macmillan observes, bears a\r\nresemblance to a red-currant berry; as it decays, the red colouring\r\nmatter fades into a deep orange, which is finally resolved into a\r\nbrownish hue. The thickness of the wall of the cell is estimated at the\r\ntwenty-thousandth part of an inch, and three hundred to four hundred\r\nof these cells might be grouped together in a smaller space than a\r\nshilling would cover. Yet each cell is a distinct individual plant;\r\nperfectly independent of others with which it may be massed; fully\r\ncapable of performing for and by itself all the functions of growth and\r\nreproduction; possessing “a containing membrane which absorbs liquids\r\nand gases from the surrounding matrix or elements, a contained fluid\r\nof peculiar character formed out of these materials, and a number of\r\nexcessively minute granules equivalent to spores, or, as some would\r\nsay, to cellular buds, which are to become the germs of new plants.”\r\nDr. Macmillan adds: “That one and the same primitive cell should thus\r\nminister equally to absorption, nutrition, and reproduction, is an\r\nextraordinary illustration of the fact that the smallest and simplest\r\norganized object is in itself, and, for the part it was created to\r\nperform in the operations of nature, as admirably adapted as the\r\nlargest and most complicated.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PROTOCOCCUS NIVALIS.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first vegetable forms to make their appearance at the limits of\r\nthe snow-line, whether in high latitudes or on mountain-summits, are\r\nlichens; which flourish on rocks, or stones, or trees, or wherever\r\nthey can obtain sufficient moisture to support existence. Upwards of\r\ntwo thousand four hundred species are known. The same kinds prevail\r\nthroughout the Arctic Regions, and the species common to both the\r\nEastern and Western Hemispheres are very numerous. They lend the\r\nbeauty of colour to many an Arctic scene which would otherwise be\r\ninexpressibly dreary; the most rugged rock acquiring a certain air\r\nof picturesqueness through their luxuriant display. Their forms are\r\nwonderfully varied; so that they present to the student of Nature\r\nan almost inexhaustible field of inquiry. In their most rudimentary\r\naspects they seem to consist of nothing more than a collection of\r\npowdery granules, so minute that the figure of each is scarcely\r\ndistinguishable, and so dry and so deficient in organization that we\r\ncannot but wonder how they live and maintain life. Now they are seen\r\nlike ink-spots on the trunks of fallen trees; now they are freely\r\nsprinkled in white dust over rocks and withered tufts of moss, others\r\nappear in gray filmy patches; others again like knots or rosettes of\r\nvarious tints; and some are pulpy and gelatinous, like aërial sea-weeds\r\nwhich the receding tide leaves bare and naked on inland rocks. A\r\ngreater complexity of structure, however, is visible in the higher\r\norder of lichens,--and we find them either tufted and shrubby, like\r\nminiature trees; or in clustering cups, which, Hebe-like, present their\r\n“dewy offerings to the sun.”\r\n\r\nIn the Polar World, and its regions of eternal winter, where snow and\r\nice, and dark drear waters, huge glacier and colossal berg, combine to\r\nform an awful and impressive picture, the traveller is thankful for the\r\nabundance of these humble and primitive forms, which communicate the\r\nfreshness and variety of life to the otherwise painful and death-like\r\nuniformity of the frost-bound Nature. It is true that here,\r\n\r\n        “Above, around, below,\r\n        On mountain or in glen,\r\n    Nor tree, nor shrub, nor plant, nor flower,”\r\n\r\nmay be found in the lands beyond the line of perpetual snow; it is true\r\nthat\r\n\r\n    “All is rocks at random thrown,\r\n    Black waves, bare crags, and banks of stone;\r\n    As if were here denied\r\n      The summer’s sun, the spring’s sweet dew,\r\n      That clothe with many a varied hue\r\n    The bleakest mountain-side;”\r\n\r\nbut vegetation is not absolutely wanting, and the lichens are so\r\nlargely developed and so widely distributed as to impart quite a\r\npeculiar and distinctive character to the scenery.\r\n\r\nA lichen which is discovered in almost every zone of altitude and\r\nlatitude, which ranges from the wild shores of Melville Island in the\r\nArctic to those of Deception Island in the Antarctic circle,--which\r\nblooms on the crests of the Himalayas, on the lofty peak of Chimborazo,\r\nand was found by Agassiz near the top of Mont Blanc,--is the _Lecidea\r\ngeographica_, a beautiful bright-green lichen, whose clusters assume\r\nalmost a kaleidoscopic appearance.\r\n\r\nA lichen of great importance in the Arctic world is the well-known\r\n_Cladonia rangiferina_, or reindeer moss, which forms the staple\r\nfood of that animal during the long Arctic winter. In the vast tundras,\r\nor steppes, of Lapland it flourishes in the greatest profusion,\r\ncompletely covering the ground with its snowy tufts, which look like\r\nthe silvery sprays of some magic plant. According to Linnæus, it\r\nthrives more luxuriantly than any other plant in the pine-forests\r\nof Lapland, the surface of the soil being carpeted with it for many\r\nmiles in extent; and if the forests are accidentally burned to the\r\nground, it quickly reappears, and grows with all its original vigour.\r\nThese plains, which seem to the traveller smitten with the curse of\r\ndesolation, the Laplander regards as fertile pastures; and here vast\r\nherds of reindeer roam at will, thriving where the horse, the elephant,\r\nand even the camel would perish. This useful animal is dependent almost\r\nentirely on a lichen for support. What a deep interest is thus attached\r\nto it! That vast numbers of families, living in pastoral simplicity\r\nin the cheerless and inhospitable Polar Regions, should depend for\r\ntheir subsistence upon the uncultured and abundant supply of a plant\r\nso low in the scale of organization as this, is, says Dr. Macmillan, a\r\nstriking proof of the great importance of even the smallest and meanest\r\nobjects in nature.\r\n\r\nWhen the ground is crusted with a hard and frozen snow, which prevents\r\nit from obtaining its usual food, the reindeer turns to another\r\nlichen, called rock-hair (_Alectoria jubata_), that grows in long\r\nbearded tufts on almost every tree. In winters of extreme rigour, the\r\nLaplanders cut down whole forests of the largest trees, that their\r\nherds may browse freely on the tufts which clothe the higher branches.\r\nHence it has been justly said that “the vast dreary pine-forests of\r\nLapland possess a character which is peculiarly their own, and are\r\nperhaps more singular in the eyes of the traveller than any other\r\nfeature in the landscapes of that remote and desolate region. This\r\ncharacter they owe to the immense number of lichens with which they\r\nabound. The ground, instead of grass, is carpeted with dense tufts of\r\nthe reindeer moss, white as a shower of new fallen snow; while the\r\ntrunks and branches of the trees are swollen far beyond their natural\r\ndimensions with huge, dusky, funereal branches of the rock-hair,\r\nhanging down in masses, exhaling a damp earthy smell, like an old\r\ncellar, or stretching from tree to tree in long festoons, waving with\r\nevery breath of wind, and creating a perpetual melancholy sound.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn regions furthest north are found various species of lichens\r\nbelonging to the genera _Gyrophora_ and _Umbilicuria_, and\r\nknown in the records of Arctic travel as rock tripe, or _tripe de\r\nroche_; a name given to them in consequence of their blistered\r\nthallus, which bears a faint resemblance to the animal substance so\r\ncalled. They afford a coarse kind of food, and proved of the greatest\r\nservice to the expeditions under Sir John Franklin; though their\r\nnutritious properties are not considerable, and, such as they are, are\r\nunfortunately impaired by the presence of a bitter principle which is\r\napt to induce diarrhœa. In Franklin and Richardson’s terrible overland\r\njourney from the Coppermine River to Fort Enterprise it was almost the\r\nsole support, at one time, of the heroic little company. Dr. Richardson\r\nsays they gathered four species of _Gyrophora_,[9] and used them\r\nall as articles of food; “but not having the means of extracting the\r\nbitter principle from them, they proved nauseous to all, and noxious\r\nto several of the party, producing severe bowel complaints.” Franklin\r\non one occasion remarks: “This was the sixth day since we had enjoyed\r\na good meal; the _tripe de roche_, even when we got enough, only\r\nserving to allay the pangs of hunger for a short time.” Again, we read:\r\n“The want of _tripe de roche_ caused us to go supperless to bed.”\r\n\r\nDr. Hayes, in the course of his “Arctic Boat Journey,” was compelled\r\nto have recourse to the same unsatisfactory fare. The rock-lichen, or\r\nstone-moss, as he calls it, he describes as about an inch in diameter\r\nat its maximum growth, and of the thickness of a wafer. It is black\r\nexternally, but when broken the interior appears white. When boiled it\r\nmakes a glutinous fluid, which is slightly nutritious.\r\n\r\n“Although in some places it grows very abundantly,” writes Dr. Hayes,\r\n“yet in one locality it, like the game, was scarce. Most of the rocks\r\nhad none upon them; and there were very few from which we could collect\r\nas much as a quart. The difficulty of gathering it was much augmented\r\nby its crispness, and the firmness of its attachment.\r\n\r\n“For this plant, poor though it was, we were compelled to dig. The\r\nrocks in every case were to be cleared from snow, and often our pains\r\nwent unrewarded. The first time this food was tried it seemed to\r\nanswer well,--it at least filled the stomach, and thus kept off the\r\nhorrid sensation of hunger until we got to sleep; but it was found to\r\nproduce afterwards a painful diarrhœa. Besides this unpleasant effect,\r\nfragments of gravel, which were mixed with the moss, tried our teeth.\r\nWe picked the plants from the rock with our knives, or a piece of\r\nhoop-iron; and we could not avoid breaking off some particles of the\r\nstone.”\r\n\r\nThese lichens are black and leather-like, studded with small black\r\npoints like “coiled wire buttons,” and attached either by an umbilical\r\nroot or by short and tenacious fibres to the rocks. Some of them may\r\nbe compared to a piece of shagreen, while others resemble a fragment\r\nof burned skin. They are met with in cold bleak localities, on Alpine\r\nheights of granite or micaceous schist, in almost all parts of the\r\nworld,--on the Scottish mountains, on the Andes, on the Himalayas; but\r\nit is in the Polar World that they most abound, spreading over the\r\nsurface of every rock a sombre Plutonian vegetation, that seems to have\r\nbeen scathed by fire and flame, until all its beauty and richness were\r\nshrivelled up.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome of the lichens in the less remote latitudes--as, for instance, in\r\nSweden--are far superior in usefulness to any of those we have hitherto\r\ndescribed. The Swedish peasant finds in them his pharmacy, his dyeing\r\nmaterials, his food. With the various lichens that grow upon the trees\r\nand rocks, says Frederika Bremer, he cures the virulent diseases which\r\nsometimes afflict him, dyes the articles of clothing which he wears,\r\nand poisons the noxious and dangerous animals which annoy him. The\r\njuniper and cranberry give him their berries, which he brews into\r\ndrink; he makes a conserve of them, and mixes their juices with his\r\ndry salt-meat, and is healthful and cheerful with these and with his\r\nlabour, of which he makes a pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe only lichen which has retained its place in modern pharmacy is\r\nthe well-known “Iceland moss.” It is still employed as a tonic and\r\nfebrifuge in ague; but more largely, when added to soups and chocolate,\r\nas an article of diet for the feeble and consumptive. In Iceland the\r\n_Cetraria Islandica_ is highly valued by the inhabitants. What\r\nbarley, rye, and oats are to the Indo-Caucasian races of Asia and\r\nWestern Europe; the olive, the fig, and the grape to the inhabitants of\r\nthe Mediterranean basin; rice to the Hindu; the tea-plant to the native\r\nof the Flowery Land; and the date palm to the Arab,--is Iceland moss to\r\nthe Icelander, the Lapp, and the Eskimo.\r\n\r\nIt is found on some of the loftiest peaks of the Scottish Highlands;\r\nbut in Iceland it overspreads the whole country, flourishing more\r\nabundantly and attaining to a larger growth on the volcanic soil of\r\nthe western coast than elsewhere. It is collected triennially, for\r\nit requires three years to reach maturity, after the spots where it\r\nthrives have been cleared. We are told that the meal obtained from\r\nit, when mixed with wheat-flour, produces a greater quantity, though\r\nperhaps a less nutritious quality, of bread than can be manufactured\r\nfrom wheat-flour alone. The great objection to it is its bitterness,\r\narising from its peculiar astringent principle, cetraria. However, the\r\nLapps and Icelanders remove this disagreeable pungency by a simple\r\nprocess. They chop the lichen to pieces, and macerate it for several\r\ndays in water mixed with salt of tartar or quicklime, which it absorbs\r\nvery readily; next they dry it, and pulverize it; then, mixed with the\r\nflour of the common knot-grass, it is made into a cake, or boiled, and\r\neaten with reindeer’s milk.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Mosses_ are abundant in the Arctic Regions, increasing in number\r\nand beauty as we approach the Pole, and covering the desert land with\r\na thin veil of verdure, which refreshes the eye and gladdens the heard\r\nof the traveller. On the hills of Lapland and Greenland, they are\r\nextensively distributed; and the landscape owes most of its interest\r\nto the charming contrasts they afford. Of all the genera, perhaps the\r\nbog-mosses, _Sphagna_, are the most luxuriant; but at the same\r\ntime they are the least attractive, and the plains which they cover are\r\neven drearier than the naked rock. In Melville Island these mosses form\r\nupwards of a fourth part of the whole flora. Much finer to the sight is\r\nthe common hair-moss (_Polytrichum commune_), which extends over\r\nthe levels of Lapland, and is used by the Lapps, when they are bound on\r\nlong journeys, for a temporary couch. We may mention also the fork-moss\r\n(_Dieranum_), which the Eskimos twist into wicks for their rude\r\nlamps.\r\n\r\nWe have not space to dwell upon the grasses and fungi, though these\r\nare numerous, and some of them interesting. The _cochlearia_, or\r\nscurvy-grass, has often proved of great utility to Arctic explorers;\r\nand Dr. Kane on more than one occasion availed himself of its\r\nmedicinal properties. Fungi extend almost to the very limits of Arctic\r\nvegetation. The Greenlanders and Lapps make use of them for tinder,\r\nor as styptics for stopping the flow of blood, and allaying pain. In\r\nSiberia they abound. Frequently, in the high latitudes, they take the\r\nform of “snow mould,” and are found growing on the barren and ungenial\r\nsnow. These species are warmed into life only when the sun has grown\r\nsufficient to melt the superficial snow-crust, without producing a\r\ngeneral thaw, and then they spread far and wide in glittering wool-like\r\npatches, dotted with specks of red or green. When the snow melts, they\r\noverspread the grass beneath like a film of cobweb, and in a day or two\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\nIn Siberia grows the fly-agaric (_Agaricus muscarius_), from which\r\nthe inhabitants obtain an intoxicating liquor of peculiarly dangerous\r\ncharacter. It has a tall white stem, surmounted by a dome of rich\r\norange scarlet, studded with white scaly tubercles, and in some parts\r\nof Kamtschatka and the northern districts of Siberia is so abundant\r\nthat the ground sparkles and shines as if covered with a scarlet\r\ncarpet. The natives collect it during the hot summer months, and dry\r\nit. Steeped in the juice of the whortleberry, it forms a powerful\r\nintoxicating wine; or rolled up like a bolus, and swallowed without\r\nchewing, it produces much the same effect as opium. On some, however,\r\nit acts as an excitant, and induces active muscular exertion. A\r\ntalkative person, under its influence, cannot keep silence or secrets;\r\none fond of music, sings incessantly; and if a person who has partaken\r\nof it wishes to step over a straw or small stick, he takes a stride or\r\njump sufficient to clear the trunk of a tree!\r\n\r\nThe Koriaks and Kamtschatkans personify this fungus, under the name of\r\n_Mocho Moro_, as one of their _penates_, or household gods;\r\nand if they are impelled by its effects to commit any dreadful crime,\r\nthey pretend they act only in obedience to commands which may not be\r\ndisputed. To qualify themselves for murder or suicide, they drink\r\nadditional doses of “this intoxicating product of decay and corruption.”\r\n\r\nDuring Captain Penny’s voyage in search of Sir John Franklin, he picked\r\nup two pieces of floating drift-wood, far beyond the usual limit of\r\nEskimo occupation, which, from their peculiar appearance, excited a\r\nlively curiosity. The one was found in Robert Bay, off Hamilton Island,\r\nlat. 76° 2’ north, and long. 76° west,--that is, in the route which\r\nFranklin’s ships, it is supposed, had followed,--and was plainly a\r\nfragment of wrought elm plank, which had been part of a ship’s timbers.\r\nIt exhibited three kinds of surface,--one that had been planed and\r\npitched, one roughly sawn, and the third split with an axe. The second\r\npiece of drift-wood was picked up on the north side of Cornwallis\r\nIsland, in lat. 75° 36’ north, and long. 96° west. It was a branch of\r\nwhite spruce, much bleached in some places, and in others charred and\r\nblackened as if it had been used for fuel.\r\n\r\nOn both fragments traces of microscopic vegetation were discovered;\r\nand as it was thought they might, if carefully examined, afford some\r\nclue to the fate of Franklin’s expedition, they were submitted to Mr.\r\nBerkeley, a well-known naturalist. In the report which he addressed to\r\nthe Admiralty, he stated that the vegetation in both cases resembled\r\nthe dark olive mottled patches with which wooden structures in this\r\ncountry, if exposed to atmospheric influences, are speedily covered.\r\nThe bleached cells and fibres of the fragment of elm were filled up\r\nwith slender fungoid forms, _myceliæ_; while on its different\r\nsurfaces appeared several dark-coloured specks, belonging to the genus\r\n_Phoma_. As it was not probable that plants so minute could have\r\nretained, through the terrible severity of an Arctic winter, their\r\ndelicate naked spores in the perfect condition in which they were\r\nfound, Mr. Berkeley concluded that they must have been developed\r\nthrough that same summer; while from three to four years, in those high\r\nlatitudes and amid the rigour of stormy ice-covered seas, would suffice\r\nto produce the bleached appearance of the wood. Hence he inferred that\r\nthe plank had not been long exposed.\r\n\r\nOn the other fragment of drift-wood he discovered some deeply-embedded\r\nminute black fungoid forms, called _Sporidesmium lepraria_. Unlike\r\nthe _phomas_, which are very ephemeral, these plants possess the\r\nlongevity of the lichens, and the same patches last for years unchanged\r\non the same pieces of wood, while their traces are discernible for\r\na still longer period. From their condition, Mr. Berkeley inferred\r\nthat the fungi on the drifted wood had not been recently developed,\r\nbut that, on the contrary, they were the remains of the species which\r\nexisted on the drift-wood when used for fuel by the unfortunate crews\r\nof Franklin’s ships, the _Erebus_ and the _Terror_.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt whatever, as Dr. Macmillan remarks, considering\r\nthe circumstances in which they were discovered, and the remarkable\r\nappearances they presented--there can be no reasonable doubt that\r\nboth fragments of drift-wood belonged to, or were connected with, the\r\nlost ships; and the curious information regarding the course they\r\npursued at a certain time, furnished by witnesses so extraordinary\r\nand unlikely as a few tiny dark specks of cryptogamic vegetation on\r\nfloating drift-wood, was confirmed, in a wonderful manner, by the\r\nafter-discovery of the first authentic account ever obtained of the sad\r\nand pathetic history of Franklin’s expedition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe reader will not expect to find the tundras of Northern Asia or\r\nthe shores of the Polar Sea rich in bud and bloom, yet even these\r\ndreary wastes are not absolutely without floral decoration. Selinum\r\nand cerathium, as well as the poppy and sorrel, andromeda, and several\r\nspecies of heath, are mentioned by Dr. Kane as blooming in the\r\nneighbourhood of Smith Strait. On the south coast of the Polar Sea Dr.\r\nRichardson found a considerable variety of vegetation. We noticed, he\r\nsays, about one hundred and seventy phænogamous or flowering plants;\r\nbeing one-fifth of the number of species which exist fifteen degrees\r\nof latitude further to the southward. He adds:--The grasses, bents,\r\nand rushes constitute only one-fifth of the number of species on the\r\ncoast, but the two former tribes actually cover more ground than\r\nall the rest of the vegetation. The _cruciferæ_, or cross-like\r\ntribe, afford one-seventh of the species, and the compound flowers are\r\nnearly as numerous. The _shrubby plants_ that reach the sea-coast\r\nare the common juniper, two species of willow, the dwarf-birch,\r\nthe common alder, the hippophaë, a gooseberry, the red bear berry\r\n(_arbutus uva ursi_), the Labrador tea-plant, the Lapland rose,\r\nthe bog-whortleberry, and the crowberry. The kidney-leaved oxyria\r\ngrows in great abundance there, and occasionally furnished us with an\r\nagreeable addition to our meals, as it resembles the garden-sorrel in\r\nflavour, but is more juicy and tender. It is eaten by the natives, and\r\nmust, as well as many of the cress-like plants, prove an excellent\r\ncorrective of the gross, oily, rancid, and frequently putrid meat on\r\nwhich they subsist. The small balls of the Alpine bistort, and the\r\nlong, succulent, and sweet roots of many of the astragaleæ, which grow\r\non the sandy shores, are eatable; but it does not seem that the Eskimos\r\nare acquainted with their use. A few clumps of white spruce-fir, with\r\nsome straggling black spruces and canoe-birches, grow at the distance\r\nof twenty or thirty miles from the sea, in sheltered situations on the\r\nbanks of rivers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt has been pointed out that the principal characteristic of the\r\nvegetation of the Arctic Regions is the predominance of perennial and\r\ncryptogamous plants; but further southward, where night begins to\r\nalternate with day, or in what may be called the sub-arctic zone, a\r\ndifference of species appears which greatly enhances the beauty of the\r\nlandscape. A rich and vividly-coloured flora adorns these latitudes in\r\nEurope as well as in Asia during their brief but ardent summer, with\r\nits intense radiance and intense warmth,--consisting of potentillas,\r\ngentians, starry chick-weeds, spreading saxifrages and sedums, spiræas,\r\ndrabas, artemisias, and the like. The power of the sun is so great,\r\nand the consequent rapidity of growth so extraordinary, that these\r\nplants spring up, and blossom, and germinate, and perish in six weeks.\r\nIn a lower latitude many ligneous plants are found,--as berry-bearing\r\nshrubs, the glaucous kalmia, the trailing azalea, the full-blossomed\r\nrhododendron. The Siberian flora differs from the European in the\r\nsame latitudes by the inclusion of the North American genera, phlox,\r\nmitella, and claytonia, and by the luxuriance of its asters, spiræas,\r\nmilk-vetches, and the saline plants goosefoot and saltwort.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Novaia Zemlaia and other northern regions the vegetation is so\r\nstunted that it barely covers the ground, but a much greater variety of\r\nminute plants of considerable beauty are aggregated there in a limited\r\nspace than in the Alpine climes of Europe where the same genera occur.\r\nThis is due to the feebleness of the vegetation; for in the Swiss\r\nAlps the same plant frequently usurps a large area, and drives out\r\nevery other,--as the dark blue gentian, the violet-tinted pansy, and\r\nthe yellow and pink stone-crops. But in the far north, where vitality\r\nis weak and the seeds do not ripen, thirty different species, it has\r\nbeen observed, may be seen “crowded together in a brilliant mass,” no\r\none being powerful enough to overcome its companions. In these frozen\r\nclimates plants may be said to live between the air and the earth, for\r\nthey scarcely raise their heads above the soil, and their roots, unable\r\nto penetrate it, creep along the surface. All the woody plants--as the\r\nbetula nava, the reticulated willow, andromeda tetragona, with a few\r\nbacciferous shrubs--trail upon the ground, and never rise more than an\r\ninch or two above it. The _Salix lanata_, the giant of the Arctic\r\nforests, is about five inches in height; while its stem, ten or twelve\r\nfeet long, lies hidden among the moss, and owes shelter, almost life,\r\nto its humble neighbour.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom Novaia Zemlaia we pass to Spitzbergen, whose flora contains about\r\nninety-three species of flowering or phænogamous plants, which, like\r\nthose already mentioned, generally grow in tufts or patches, as if\r\nfor the sake of mutual protection. The delicate mosses which clothe\r\nthe moist lowlands, and the hardy lichens which incrust the rocks\r\nup to the remotest limits of vegetation, are very numerous. Some of\r\nthe Spitzbergen plants are found on the Alps, at elevations varying\r\nfrom 9000 to 10,000 feet above the sea-level; such as the _Arenaria\r\nbiflora_, the _Cerastium alpinum_, and the _Ranunculus glacialis_. The\r\nonly esculent plant is the _Cochlearia fenestrata_, which here loses\r\nits bitter principles, so much complained of by our Arctic explorers,\r\nand may be eaten as a salad. Iceland moss and several grasses afford\r\nsustenance for the reindeer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA very different description is given of Kamtschatka, to which we are\r\nonce more brought in the course of our rapid survey. Its climate is\r\nmuch more temperate and uniform than that of Siberia, and as the air\r\nis humid, the herbaceous vegetation is extraordinarily luxuriant.\r\nNot only along the banks of the rivers and lakes, but in the avenues\r\nand copses of the woodlands, the grass attains a height of fully\r\ntwelve feet, while the size of some of the compositæ and umbelliferæ\r\nis really colossal. For example, the _Heraclium dulce_ and the\r\n_Senecio cannabifolius_ frequently grow so tall as to overtop a\r\nrider upon horseback. The pasturage is so rich that the grass generally\r\nyields three crops every summer. A species of lily, the dark purple\r\n_Fritallaria sarrana_, is very abundant, and the inhabitants use\r\nits tubers instead of bread and meal. If the fruits of the bread-fruit\r\ntree are pre-eminent among all others, as affording man a perfect\r\nsubstitute for bread, the roots of the sarrana, which are very similar\r\nin taste, rank perhaps immediately after them. The collection of\r\nthese tubers in the meadows is an important summer occupation of the\r\nwomen, and one which is rather troublesome, as the plant never grows\r\ngregariously, so that each root has to be dug out separately with a\r\nknife. Fortunately the work of gathering the tubers is much lightened\r\nby the activity of the Siberian field-vole, which excavates an ample\r\nburrow, and stores it for winter provision with a large supply of\r\nroots, chiefly those of the sarrana.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo sum up:--\r\n\r\nWhat may be called the Arctic climate extends over nearly the whole\r\nof Danish America, the newly-acquired possessions of the United\r\nStates, the original Hudson Bay Territory, and Labrador, down to that\r\nunimportant watershed which separates from the tributaries of Hudson\r\nBay the three great basins of the St. Lawrence, the five great lakes,\r\nand the Mississippi. This line of watershed undulates between the 52nd\r\nand 49th parallels of latitude, from Belle Isle Strait to the sources\r\nof the Saskatchewan, in the Rocky Mountains, where it inflects towards\r\nthe Pacific Ocean, skirting on the north the basin of the Columbia.\r\n\r\nThus bounded on the south, the Arctic lands of America, including the\r\ngroups of islands lying to the north and north-east, cannot occupy less\r\nthan 560,000 square leagues. They exceed, therefore, the superficial\r\narea of the European lands, estimated at about 490,000 square leagues.\r\n\r\nWe propose to divide these lands into two zones or regions, the wooded\r\nand the desert zones: the former, in America, includes the basins of\r\nthe Upper Mackenzie, the Churchill, the Nelson, and the Severn.\r\n\r\nIn the wooded zone the thermometer does not rise above zero until the\r\nmonth of May. Then, under the influence of a more genial temperature,\r\nthe breath of life passes into the slumbering, inert vegetation. Then\r\nthe reddish shoots of the willows, the poplars, and the birches hang\r\nout their long cottony catkins; a pleasant greenness spreads over copse\r\nand thicket; the dandelion, the burdock, and the saxifrages lift their\r\nheads in the shelter of the rocks; the sweet-brier fills the air with\r\nfragrance, and the gooseberry and the strawberry are put forth by a\r\nkindly nature; while the valleys bloom and the hill-sides are glad with\r\nthe beauty of the thuja, the larch, and the pine.\r\n\r\nThe boundary between the wooded zone and the barren would be shown by a\r\nline drawn from the mouth of the Churchill in Hudson Bay to Mount St.\r\nElias on the Pacific coast, traversing the southern shores of the Bear\r\nand the Slave Lakes. To the north, this barren zone touches on eternal\r\nsnow, and includes the ice-bound coasts of the Parry Archipelago; to\r\nthe east and the north-east, identity of climate and uniform character\r\nof soil bring within it the greatest part of Labrador and all Greenland.\r\n\r\nIn Asia the isothermal line of O° descends towards the 55th parallel of\r\nlatitude, one lower than in America,--though to the north of it some\r\nimportant towns are situated, as Tobolsk, lat. 58° 11’; Irkutsk, lat,\r\n58° 16’; and Yakutsk, lat. 62°.\r\n\r\nIn Continental Europe, the only Arctic lands properly so called,\r\nand distinguished by an Arctic flora, are Russian Lapland and the\r\ndeeply-indented coast of Northern Russia. Far away to the north, and\r\nseparated from the continent by a narrow arm of the sea, lie the three\r\nalmost contiguous islands known as Novaia Zemlaia (lat. 68° 50’ to 76°\r\nN.). And still further north, almost equidistant from the Old World and\r\nthe New, lies the gloomy mountainous archipelago of Spitzbergen (lat.\r\n77° to 81°, and long. 10° to 24°).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have now only to recapitulate the general characters of the Arctic\r\nflora, as they would present themselves to a traveller advancing from\r\nthe wooded zone into the desert, and thence to the borders of the Polar\r\nSea.\r\n\r\nOn the southern margin of the wooded region, as in Sweden, Russia,\r\nand Siberia, extend immense forests, chiefly of coniferous trees.\r\nAs we move towards the north these forests dwindle into scattered\r\nwoods and isolated coppices, composed chiefly of stunted poplars\r\nand dwarf birches and willows. The sub-alpine myrtle, and a small\r\ncreeping honeysuckle with rounded leaves, are met with in favourable\r\nsituations. Continuing our northerly progress, we wholly leave behind\r\nthe arborescent species; but the rocks and cliffs are bright with\r\nplants belonging to the families of the ranunculaceæ, saxifragaceæ,\r\ncruciferæ, and gramineæ. To the dwarf firs and pigmy willows succeed\r\na few scattered shrubs--such as the gooseberry, the strawberry, the\r\nraspberry, pseudo-mulberry (_Rubus chamæmorus_)--indigenous to\r\nthis region, and the Lapland oleander (_Rhododendron laponicum_).\r\n\r\nStill advancing northward, we find, at the extreme limits of the\r\nmainland, some drabas (_Cruciferæ_), potentillas (_Rosaceæ_), burweeds\r\nand rushes (_Cyperaceæ_), and lastly a great abundance of mosses and\r\nlichens. The commonest mosses are the _Splechnum_, which resembles\r\nsmall umbels; and, in moist places, the _Sphagnum_, or bog-moss, whose\r\nsuccessive accumulations, from a remote epoch, have formed, with the\r\ndetritus of the _Cyperaceæ_, extensive areas of peat, which at a future\r\nday will perhaps be utilized for fuel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe come now to examine the forms of Animal Life which exist under the\r\nconditions of climate and vegetation we have been describing.\r\n\r\nForemost we must place the animal which, in the Arctic World, occupies\r\nmuch the same position as the camel in the Tropical,--the reindeer\r\n(_Cervus turandus_).\r\n\r\nIn size the reindeer resembles the English stag, but his form is less\r\ngraceful and more compressed. He stands about four feet six inches\r\nin height. Long, slender, branching horns embellish his head. The\r\nupper part of his body is of a brown colour, the under part is white;\r\nbut as the animal advances in years his entire coat changes to a\r\ngrayish-white, and, in not a few cases, is pure white. The nether part\r\nof the neck, or dewlap, droops like a pendent beard. The hoofs are\r\nlarge, long, and black; and so are the secondary hoofs on the hind\r\nfeet. The latter, when the animal is running, make by their collision a\r\ncurious clattering sound, which may be heard at a considerable distance.\r\n\r\nThe reindeer anciently invaded Europe and Asia to a comparatively low\r\nlatitude; and Julius Cæsar includes it among the animals of the great\r\nHercynian forest. Even in our own time large herds traverse the wooded\r\nheights of the southern prolongation of the Ouralian range. Between the\r\nVolga and the Don they descend to the 46th parallel; and they extend\r\ntheir wanderings as far as the very foot of the Caucasus, on the banks\r\nof the Kouma. Still, the proper habitat of the reindeer is that region\r\nof ice and snow bounded by the Arctic Circle,--or, more exactly, by the\r\nisothermal line of 0° C.\r\n\r\nBoth the wild and the tame species change their feeding-grounds with\r\nthe seasons. In winter they come down into the plains and valleys; in\r\nsummer they retire to the mountains, where the wild herds gain the\r\nmost elevated terraces, in order to escape the pertinacious attacks of\r\ntheir insect-enemies. It is a fact worthy of note that every species\r\nof animal is infested by a parasitical insect. The œstre so terrifies\r\nthe reindeer that the mere appearance of one in the air will infuriate\r\na troop of a thousand animals. In the moulting season these insects\r\ndeposit their eggs in the skin of the unfortunate animal, and there\r\nthe larvæ lodge and multiply _ad infinitum_, incessantly renewing\r\ncentres of suppuration.\r\n\r\nTo the natives of North America the reindeer is invaluable. There is\r\nhardly a part of the animal not made available for some useful purpose.\r\nClothing made of its skin is, according to Sir J. Richardson, so\r\nimpervious to cold, that, with the addition of a coverlet made of the\r\nsame material, any one so protected may bivouac on the snow with safety\r\nin the most intense cold of the Arctic night. The venison, when in high\r\ncondition, has several inches of fat on the haunches, and is said to\r\nequal that of the fallow-deer in our English parks; the tongue, and a\r\nportion of the tripe, are reckoned most delicious morsels. Pemmican\r\nis made by pouring one-third part of fat over two-third parts of the\r\npounded meat, and mixing fat and meat thoroughly together. The Eskimos\r\nand Greenlanders consider the stomach, or paunch, with its contents,\r\na special delicacy; and Captain Sir James Ross says that the contents\r\nform the only vegetable food ever tasted by the natives of Boothia. For\r\nthe reindeer is a herbivorous animal, and feeds upon the mosses and\r\ngrasses.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: WILD REINDEER.]\r\n\r\nThe reindeer is by no means a graceful animal; its joints are large,\r\nand powerful in proportion to its size; the divided hoofs are very\r\nlarge, and as the animal is compelled to lift its feet high when going\r\nover the snow, its gallop has none of that beautiful elastic spring\r\nwhich characterizes the deer of our own islands, though its pace is\r\n“telling,” and soon carries it ahead of everything but the long-winded,\r\nlong-legged wolf.\r\n\r\nThe stags cast their antlers, and the does drop their young, in May or\r\nJune, about the time of the first thaw. The males and females are then\r\nvery seldom found together; the female deer collecting in small herds\r\nwith their young; the little creatures, which seem all eyes, ears,\r\nand legs, taking alarm at any unaccustomed sound or the slightest\r\nappearance of danger. The summer vegetation fattens the bucks and does\r\namazingly, and the fawns thrive and develop; all three, says Osborn,\r\nhaving a comparative holiday, and getting into condition to face the\r\ntrials of the coming winter; while the wolf and the fox, their sworn\r\nenemies, are pursuing the infant seals and bears, or attending to their\r\nown little domestic duties. But when the autumn frost sets in, and\r\nhardens the ground, and the dense snow once more overspreads the dreary\r\nnorthern landscape, the wolves resume their attacks on the unfortunate\r\ndeer.\r\n\r\nFor warmth or protection, and following the natural instincts of\r\ngregarious animals, they now begin to collect together in large herds\r\nof bucks, does, and fawns, numbering as many as sixty and seventy head.\r\nThe stags seem to undertake the discipline of these large companies, as\r\nwell as to be responsible for their safety.\r\n\r\nCaptain Mecham relates that, in October 1852, when crossing that part\r\nof Melville Island which intervenes between Liddon Gulf and Winter\r\nHarbour, he fell in with as many as three hundred head of deer; and he\r\nadds that reindeer were always in sight, in herds varying from ten to\r\nsixty in number. One of these herds, containing twenty males, he tried\r\nto stalk up to on the 7th of October, but failed in getting a shot at\r\nthem; for although the does, with the inherent weakness of their sex,\r\nshowed an excessive curiosity, and made one or two efforts to desert\r\nthe herd and examine the stranger, the stags would in nowise tolerate\r\nsuch conduct, but chastised them smartly with their antlers, and kept\r\nthe herd together and in motion by running rapidly round and round,\r\nuttering at the same time a strange noise which seemed to alarm the\r\nherd, and keep it flying from the suspected danger.\r\n\r\nThe coat of the reindeer in summer-time is remarkably thin, and adapted\r\nadmirably in colour to that of the snow-denuded soil; but as winter\r\napproaches, it thickens, and gradually resumes its snowy whiteness.\r\nThough not, strictly speaking, a _fur_, it forms an admirable\r\nnon-conducting substance.\r\n\r\nAs winter, “ruler of the inverted year,” extends his sway over the\r\nPolar World, and food grows scarce and indifferent, and has to be\r\nsought over larger areas, the herds break up into companies of ten\r\nor twenty animals; the lichens, the reindeer moss already described\r\n(_Cetraria Islandica_), and the sprouts of the creeping willow\r\nforming their principal food.\r\n\r\nOn this branch of our subject Admiral Sherard Osborn makes two\r\nsuggestive remarks.\r\n\r\nArctic vegetation, he observes, has no time in the autumn to wither\r\nor decay--while in full bloom, and before the juices have time to\r\nreturn into the parent root or be otherwise dissipated, the “magic\r\nhand of the frost king” strikes them; and thus the wisdom of the\r\nCreator has provided for the nourishment of his creatures a fresh and\r\nwarmth-creating food, lying hid under a mantle of snow, which the\r\ninstinct of those Arctic animals teaches them to remove and reach the\r\nstores so beneficently preserved beneath.\r\n\r\nMoreover, most herbivorous animals have a slow system of digestion,\r\neven in a domestic state; as, for instance, our cattle and sheep. This\r\nappears to be more conspicuously the case in the musk-ox, the reindeer,\r\nand the Arctic hare, and is of great utility in lands where vegetation\r\nis scanty and wide-spread, and the weather occasionally so severe as to\r\ncompel these creatures, for two or three days at a time, to think only\r\nof their safety by seeking shelter from the snow-storms in deep ravines\r\nor under lofty cliffs. It appears in their case as if Nature extracted\r\nfrom their food a greater quantity of nourishment than she does from\r\nthat of animals in more southern latitudes; or possibly, the food,\r\nby the mere act of remaining in the stomach or intestines, serves to\r\ncheck the cravings of appetite, though no further nutriment should be\r\nextracted.\r\n\r\nMost of the musk-oxen and deer shot in Captain M’Clintock’s expedition,\r\nand especially the musk-oxen, had their entrails distended with food\r\napparently quite digested, while the surrounding country in many cases\r\nwas absolutely barren and lifeless,--inducing the conclusion that these\r\ncreatures had been a long time collecting their supplies, as also that\r\nit had been a long time swallowed, and necessitated the full activity\r\nof the vital principle to prevent the food from proving a source of\r\ndisease. This, indeed, was clearly proved in the case of the musk-oxen,\r\nwhich, if shot, and left twelve hours without being disembowelled,\r\ngrew tainted throughout with a strong musky odour, rendering the flesh\r\nuneatable.\r\n\r\nIt may also be stated, as an illustration of the facility with which\r\nthe reindeer can winter in high latitudes, that in Lapland, where they\r\nare used as beasts of draught, a daily supply of four pounds of lichen\r\n(_Cenomyce rangiferina_) is considered ample for a working animal;\r\nand on this dietary a reindeer will be in sufficiently good condition\r\nto go without food occasionally for two or three days, and yet, to all\r\nappearance, not to be distressed.\r\n\r\nThus, as regards its stores of food, and its provision against the\r\nseverity of the Arctic winter, the reindeer would seem to be suitably\r\nand amply endowed; and its greatest trial is the incessant rapacity of\r\nthe wolves that follow its track throughout the winter season. As that\r\nseason advances, the unfortunate animal apparently resigns itself to an\r\nevil which it cannot avoid or avert; and the calm composure with which\r\na small troop of these creatures will graze with an _entourage_\r\nof half a dozen wolves is not less curious to the observer than\r\nphilosophical on the part of the reindeer!\r\n\r\n“A herd of deer,” says an eye-witness, “thus surrounded by the wolves,\r\nwho were too great cowards to rush in upon their prey, would be\r\nstartled every now and then by the long-drawn unearthly howl of the\r\nhungry brutes; sometimes a frightened deer, horror-stricken at the\r\nabominable chant, dashes madly away from the herd,--away all, or a\r\nportion, of the wolfish fraternity go after it. In many cases the scene\r\nmay be briefly summed up with the old three-volume _denouement_\r\nof--a rush, a shriek, a crunching of bones, and snarling of beasts of\r\nprey, and all is over! for the wonderful powers of swallow and horrid\r\nvoracity of an Arctic wolf must be seen to be understood; no writer\r\nwould peril his reputation for veracity by repeating what has been seen\r\non that head. But sometimes the frightened deer gains the open country,\r\nand goes wonderful distances dogged by the persevering wolf, who\r\nassuredly has it, unless another herd is met which admits the hunted\r\ndeer into its ranks.\r\n\r\n“Occasionally, whilst a herd of deer are grazing, one of them may\r\nhappen to hit upon a spot where the food is plentiful; it naturally\r\nlingers there, while the herd is moving slowly on against the wind.\r\nThe wolves immediately mark the straggler, and stealthily crawl on,\r\ntheir object being to cut him off from the herd; that effected, there\r\nis a howl and a rush, which if the deer does not evade by extraordinary\r\nexertions, his fate is instantly sealed.”\r\n\r\nThese scenes are enacted throughout the long Arctic winter. When sight\r\nis rendered useless, scent comes to the aid of the rapacious destroyer;\r\nand we can well believe that many an explorer, in the December darkness\r\nof the frozen wastes, has often wished his olfactory nerves were as\r\nsensitively organized as those of the wolf. For although he can then\r\nhear the reindeer, it is impossible to see them, except when they hurry\r\nacross the dark but snowy landscape; and many a bad shot has been made\r\nby a hungry seaman at a large pair of melancholy eyes which peered out\r\nof the enveloping mist, because he could not tell, for the life of him,\r\nwhether the animal was distant two or twenty yards.\r\n\r\nIn the dreadful winter of 1852–53, the deer approached close to the\r\nexploring-ship _Investigator_, having quitted the land and\r\ntraversed the belt of ice. It is difficult to say whether this was\r\ndone with a view of seeking the warmth which instinct, if not scent,\r\ntold them radiated from the vessels,--the vessels, compared with the\r\ntemperature everywhere prevailing (namely, 9·5° below freezing-point),\r\nbeing complete volcanoes of heat; or whether it was for security\r\nagainst their wolfish enemies. Probably, it was for the first-named\r\nreason; inasmuch as it is recorded that the foxes of Leopold Harbour,\r\nin 1848, soon became aware of the warmer atmosphere produced by the\r\npresence of Sir James Ross’s squadron, and sagaciously burrowed and\r\nbred in the embankments thrown up around the ships.\r\n\r\nBut, at length, winter and its sorrows pass away, and early in the new\r\nyear a happier life dawns on the much-tried reindeer. In February and\r\nMarch the seals begin to breed, and as the attention of the wolves and\r\nother beasts of prey is then drawn to the helpless young, which are\r\ntruly “delicious morsels,” the holidays of the reindeer may be said to\r\ncommence. We may remind the reader also that the Arctic hare and the\r\nlemming winter in the icy north, and yield occasional meals to wolf and\r\nfox.\r\n\r\nThe spring returns, and as the sun rises above the horizon, the great\r\nherds gradually break up and scatter abroad; and the deer may then\r\nbe seen in wandering groups of three or four, until once more the\r\nautumn-twilight deepens, and they reassemble in numerous companies.\r\n\r\nAs the reindeer is the camel of the Polar World, so the Arctic wolf may\r\nbe said to occupy the place of the tiger; so daring is its courage,\r\nand so fierce its lust of blood. Assembling in large packs, they are\r\nnot afraid to haunt the immediate neighbourhood of man. In Captain\r\nM’Clintock’s expedition, they gathered round the _Investigator_\r\nat such close quarters, that it was unsafe for the crew to leave the\r\nship, unless in companies, and well-armed; and with their melancholy\r\nhowls they made night hideous. Five of them attempted to pounce on an\r\nEskimo dog which had long been the pet of the _Investigator_. One\r\nof these brutes is described as a “perfect giant,” standing nearly four\r\nfeet high at the shoulder, and having a footmark as big as a reindeer’s.\r\n\r\nOur English seamen planned many a clever scheme to entrap these wary\r\ncreatures, but all failed, while some of the encounters with them\r\nwere unpleasantly close, and the risk very considerable. One day, the\r\nboatswain, while out shooting, broke by a shot two of the legs of a\r\nfine buck reindeer. Evening coming on, and he knowing the animal could\r\nnot drag itself far, returned to the ship. Next morning, he started\r\nat an early hour to secure his prize. What was his disgust, when he\r\narrived at the place, to find his booty in the possession of five large\r\nwolves and several foxes! Determined to have, at all events, a share,\r\nthe boatswain advanced, shouting with all his might, and hurling at the\r\nthieves every opprobrious phrase he could invent, yet afraid to fire\r\nhis single-barrelled gun at any one of them, for fear the rest should\r\nserve him as they were serving the buck; more particularly as they\r\nappeared inclined to show fight, and made no sign of retreat until he\r\nwas within four yards. Even then only four had the grace to move away,\r\nsitting down a pistol-shot off, and howling most lamentably.\r\n\r\nThe boatswain picked up a leg of the deer, which had been dismembered,\r\nand then grasped one end of the half-devoured carcass, while a large\r\nshe wolf tugged against him at the other.\r\n\r\nIt must be owned that this position was a disagreeable one, and had the\r\nhowling of the four wolves brought others of their kind to the rescue,\r\nthe consequences of this affray between hungry wolves and a no less\r\nhungry sailor might have proved serious. Fortunately, the interpreter,\r\nwho chanced likewise to be out shooting on a neighbouring hill, had his\r\nattention attracted by the noise of the brutes, and made his appearance\r\non the scene. He afterwards described it as the strangest he had ever\r\nwitnessed. So close were the boatswain and the carnivora in their\r\nstruggle for the meat, that he fancied the latter had actually attacked\r\nthe former. On the arrival of this reinforcement the wolves decamped,\r\nleaving the gallant boatswain with only twenty pounds weight of meat,\r\ninstead of the one hundred and twenty his prize must have originally\r\nweighed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe identities between the Arctic dog and the Arctic wolf are so\r\nimportant that Dr. Kane agrees with Mr. Broderip in assigning to these\r\nanimals a family origin. The oblique position of the wolf’s eye is not\r\nuncommon among the Eskimo dogs. Dr. Kane had a slut, one of the tamest\r\nand most affectionate of his team, who had the long legs, the compact\r\nbody, the drooping tail, and the wild scared expression of the eye,\r\nwhich some naturalists have supposed to distinguish the wolf alone.\r\nWhen domesticated early--and it is easy to domesticate him--the wolf\r\nfollows and loves you like a dog. “That they are fond of wandering\r\nproves nothing; many of our pack will stray for weeks,” says Kane,\r\n“into the wilderness of ice; yet they cannot be persuaded, when they\r\ncome back, to inhabit the kennel we have built for them only a few\r\nhundred yards off. They crouch around for the companionship of men.”\r\nBoth animals howl in unison alike; and, in most parts, their footprint\r\nis the same.\r\n\r\nThe musk-ox (_Ovibos moschatus_) is one of the largest of\r\nthe Polar ruminants. As its zoological name indicates, it is an\r\nintermediary between the ox and the sheep. Smaller than the former,\r\nlarger than the latter, it reminds us of both in its shape and general\r\nappearance. It has an obtuse nose; horns broad at the base, covering\r\nthe forehead and crown of the head, and curving downwards between\r\nthe eye and ear until about the level of the mouth, where they turn\r\nupwards; the tail is short, and almost hidden by the thickness of the\r\nshaggy hair, which is generally of a dark brown, and of two kinds, as\r\nwith all the animals of the Polar Regions; a long hair, which on some\r\nparts of the body is thick and curled, and, underneath, a fine kind of\r\nsoft, ash-coloured wool; the legs are short and thick, and furnished\r\nwith narrow hoofs, like those of the moose. The female is smaller than\r\nthe male, and her horns are smaller. Her general colour is black,\r\nexcept that the legs are whitish, and along the back runs an elevated\r\nridge or mane of dusky hair.\r\n\r\nThe musk-ox, as his name implies, throws out a strong odour of\r\nmusk,--with which, indeed, his very flesh is impregnated, so that the\r\nscent is communicated to the knife used in cutting up the animal. Not\r\nthe less is he regarded as a valuable booty by the Indians and the\r\nEskimos, who hunt him eagerly. He wanders in small troops over the\r\nrocky prairies which extend to the north of the great lakes of North\r\nAmerica. He is a fierce-tempered animal, and in defence of his female\r\nwill fight desperately.\r\n\r\nHis general habits resemble strongly those of the reindeer; but his\r\nrange appears to be principally limited to Melville Island, Banks Land,\r\nand the large islands to the south-east of the latter.\r\n\r\nOne of our Arctic explorers describes the musk-oxen as all very wild\r\nin April, and as generally seen in large herds from ten to seventy in\r\nnumber. In June they were stupidly tame, and seemed to be oppressed\r\nby their heavy coats of wool, which were hanging loosely down their\r\nshoulders and hind-quarters in large quantities; the herds much\r\nsmaller, and generally composed of cows and calves.\r\n\r\nThe heavy coat of wool with which the musk-oxen are provided, is a\r\nperfect protection against any temperature. It consists of a long fine\r\nblack hair, and in some cases white (for it is not ascertained that\r\nthese oxen change their colour during the winter), with a beautiful\r\nfine wool or fur underneath, softer and richer than the finest alpaca\r\nwool, as well as much longer in the staple. This mantle apparently\r\ntouches the ground; and the little creature looks, it is said, like a\r\nbale of black wool, mounted on four short nervous goat-like legs, with\r\ntwo very bright eyes, and a pair of sharp “wicked-shaped” horns peering\r\nout of one end of it.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE MUSK-OX.]\r\n\r\nThey seem to be of very uncertain temper, sometimes standing stupidly\r\nglaring at their assailants, whetting their horns against their fore\r\nlegs; at other times, they will rush furiously against their hunters.\r\n\r\nCaptain Mecham discovered very great numbers of musk-oxen near the\r\nhead of Hardy Bay, Melville Island. On one plain he observed as many\r\nas seventy grazing within a circuit of two miles; on his approach,\r\nthey divided into herds of about fifteen each, headed by two or three\r\nenormous bulls. Their manœuvres, he says, were so quick and regular\r\nthat they might be more fittingly compared to squadrons of cavalry than\r\nanything else he could think of. One herd moved forward at a gallop,\r\nseveral times within rifle-shot, and formed in perfect line with bulls\r\nin the van, presenting a formidable array of horns. The last time they\r\nadvanced at a gallop until within about sixty yards, when they formed\r\nin line, the bulls snorting wildly, and tearing up the snow. But as\r\nsoon as Captain Mecham fired they wheeled round promptly, rejoined the\r\nmain body, and made off out of sight, only waiting occasionally for the\r\nwounded animal.\r\n\r\nThe following graphic account of an encounter with a musk-ox is given\r\nby Captain M’Clintock:--\r\n\r\n“We saw and shot two very large bulls--a well-timed supply, as the last\r\nof the venison was used up; we found them to be in better condition\r\nthan any we had ever seen. I shall never forget the death-struggle\r\nof one of these noble bulls; a Spanish bull-fight gives no idea of\r\nit, and even the slaughter of the bear is tame in comparison. This\r\nanimal was shot through the lungs, and blood gushed from his nostrils\r\nupon the snow. As it stood fiercely watching us, prepared yet unable\r\nto charge, its small but fixed glaring eyes were almost concealed by\r\nmasses of shaggy hair, and its whole frame was fearfully convulsed with\r\nagony; the tremulous motion was communicated to its enormous covering\r\nof tangled wool and hair; even the coarse thick mane seemed to rise\r\nindignant, and slowly waved from side to side. It seemed as if the very\r\nfury of its passion was pent up within it for one final and revengeful\r\ncharge. There was no roaring; the majestic beast was dumb; but the\r\nwild gleam of savage fire which shot from his eyes, and his menacing\r\nattitude, were far more terrible than the most hideous bellow. We\r\nwatched in silence, for time was doing our work, nor did we venture to\r\nlower our guns until, his strength becoming exhausted, he reeled and\r\nfell.\r\n\r\n“I have never witnessed such an intensity of rage, nor imagined for one\r\nmoment that such an apparently stupid brute, under any circumstances\r\nof pain and passion, could have presented such a truly appalling\r\nspectacle. It is almost impossible to conceive a more terrific sight\r\nthan that which was presented to us in the dying moments of this\r\nmatchless denizen of the northern wilds.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt seems doubtful whether the wolf, which is naturally a most cowardly\r\ncreature, can act on the offensive against the musk-ox; and most Arctic\r\nnavigators seem of opinion that it attacks only lame or sickly cattle.\r\n\r\nThe activity of these oxen, and-their goat-like power of climbing, is\r\nvery remarkable, and much at variance with their clumsy appearance.\r\nThey have been seen making their way, when frightened, up the face of\r\na cliff which defied all human efforts, and going down the precipitous\r\nsides of ravines by alternately sliding upon their hams, or pitching\r\nand arresting their downward course, as Sherard Osborn remarks, by\r\nthe use of the magnificent shield of horn which spreads across their\r\nforeheads, in a manner to excite the liveliest astonishment of the\r\nspectator.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Arctic Fox (_Canis lagopus_) cannot compare with either of\r\nthe preceding animals in importance or interest, yet it figures very\r\nlargely in the journals of our Arctic explorers. It is smaller than the\r\ncommon European fox; has a sharp nose, and short rounded ears, almost\r\nconcealed in its fur; the legs are short, and the toes covered both\r\nabove and below with a thick soft fur; the tail is shorter than that\r\nof the common fox, but more bushy. Its range is very extensive, for it\r\nis found in the lands bordering on the Polar Sea in both continents.\r\nAs winter approaches, its coat of hair grows thick and ragged; until\r\nat length it becomes as white as snow--the change of colour taking\r\nplace last on the ridge of the back and the tip of the tail. Its food\r\nconsists of various small quadrupeds,--such as the Arctic hare and the\r\nlemming,--on all kinds of water-fowl and their eggs, on the carcasses\r\nof fish, shell-fish, and the refuse of the young seals killed and\r\ndevoured by the Polar bear. In the track of the latter it seems to hunt\r\nsystematically. It swims with dexterity, and will cross from island to\r\nisland in search of prey. Its fur is light and warm, though not very\r\ndurable, and for the sake of this fur it is pursued both in Arctic\r\nAsia, Greenland, and Hudson Bay. It is a wary animal, however, and not\r\neasily caught.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ARCTIC FOXES.]\r\n\r\nDr. Hayes affords us an illustration of this statement.\r\n\r\nAs he and a follower, named Bonsall, on one occasion were exploring\r\nin Northumberland Island, they discovered a fox scampering away over\r\nthe plain. Bonsall gave chase, but could not arrive within shooting\r\ndistance. Another was then heard barking overhead at them. Dr. Hayes\r\nseized his gun, and climbing over some huge boulders which filled\r\nthe bottom of the gorge, endeavoured, by crawling behind a rock, to\r\novertake or approach the animal; but it seemed to be aware of his\r\nintentions, and scampering away, led him a wild chase across the plain.\r\nThe astute Reynard first made off, so that his assailant “could not\r\ncover him upon the cliff;” and when out of danger, perched upon a\r\nstone, and barked at him in the most tantalizing manner. The doctor\r\napproached within long range. Immediately, as he was about to bring his\r\ngun to his shoulder, it dropped behind the stone and fled to another,\r\nwhere it set up the same rapid chatter,--a shrill “Huk! huk! huk!”\r\nsounding like a mixture of anger and defiance. Again Dr. Hayes tried\r\nto approach it, but with no better success; round and round it ran,\r\nuntil at length, weary of following it, Dr. Hayes fired. Some of the\r\nshot probably touched it, for it screamed loudly; but it fled with\r\nremarkable rapidity, and finally baffled its pursuer.\r\n\r\nAs the flesh of the fox is by no means to be despised, and, indeed,\r\nranks as a dainty in the bill of fare of an Arctic navigator, a hot\r\npursuit of it is often maintained, and traps are constructed to ensure\r\nits capture. These are usually built on much the same principle as a\r\nrabbit-trap. Selecting a smooth level rock, the trappers arrange some\r\nflat stones of about six inches thick, so as to enclose on three sides\r\nan area of six inches by two feet and a half. Over this enclosure other\r\nflat stones are laid; and between the two used to close up one of the\r\nends a peg is inserted, so as to project about an inch within the trap.\r\n\r\nTo this peg, by means of a loop, is loosely hung a small piece of meat;\r\nand to the same peg, outside, is attached another loop made at the end\r\nof a cord, the cord being carried up through the rear of the trap, and\r\nover the top to the front, where it is fastened round a thin flat flag\r\nof slate, which moves freely up and down, being guided and held by a\r\ncouple of large blocks placed one on either side of the entrance.\r\n\r\nThe way in which this machinery works is very simple:--\r\n\r\nThe fox enters under the slide or trap-door, advances to the rear,\r\nseizes the bait, and attempts to back out. The bait, of course, is\r\npulled from the peg, and with it the loop supporting the door comes\r\noff. As soon as its support is removed down comes the door, and Master\r\nReynard is entrapped. Everything now depends on the manner in which the\r\ncracks have been closed up; for if the animal can thrust its little\r\nnose between a couple of stones, it will assuredly effect its escape.\r\nNor is it less important that the enclosure should not be sufficiently\r\nlarge to enable the fox to turn round; for in that case it generally\r\ncontrives to loosen the door, and depart in infinite glee.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A FOX TRAP.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Arctic fox is described by Dr. Hayes as the prettiest and most\r\nprovoking of living creatures. One which he unsuccessfully chased for\r\nfully three hours was about the size of a domestic cat, round and\r\nplump, white as the snow, with a long pointed nose, and a trailing\r\nbushy tail, which seemed to be its particular pride. It was quite\r\nevident that it enjoyed the perplexities of its hunters, as it leaped\r\nfrom rock to rock, or circled round and about them, and showed the\r\nutmost indifference to the miseries of their famished condition. It\r\nrolled and tossed about among the loose drift, now springing into the\r\nair, now bounding away, now stopping short, and now cocking its head to\r\none side and elevating one foot, as if listening, seeming all the time\r\nto be intent on exhibiting its “points” to its enemies, for whom it did\r\nnot care the value of the minutest part of its very pretty tail. Weary\r\nand exhausted, Dr. Hayes abandoned the pursuit, and returned to his\r\ncamp, followed by the fox, though always at a safe distance; and when\r\nthey last caught sight of it, as they looked back from the rocks above\r\nthe hut, it was mounted on an elevation, uttering its shrill sharp cry,\r\nin apparent mockery of their defeat.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf the supposed relations between the bear and the fox, Dr. Kane\r\nremarks that he once thought his observations had confirmed them. It\r\nis certain that they are frequently found together; the bear striding\r\non ahead with his prey, the fox behind gathering in the crumbs as they\r\nfall; and Dr. Kane often saw the parasite licking at the traces of a\r\nwounded seal which his champion had borne off over the snow. The story\r\nis that the two hunt in couples. This may well be doubted, though it\r\nis clear that the inferior animal rejoices in his association with\r\nthe superior, at least for the profits, if not the sympathy it brings\r\nto him. “I once wounded a bear,” says Dr. Kane, “when I was out with\r\nMorton, and followed him for twelve miles over the ice. A miserable\r\nlittle fox travelled close behind his patron, and licked up the blood\r\nwherever he lay down. The bear at last made the water; and as we\r\nreturned from our fruitless chase, we saw the fox running at full speed\r\nalong the edge of the thin ice as if to rejoin him.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA welcome addition to the meagre fare of the Arctic navigator is\r\nfurnished by the Arctic Hare (_Lepus glacialis_), which, like\r\nthe reindeer, collects in herds or troops as winter approaches. As\r\nmany as two hundred have been seen at a time; and at one of their\r\nfavourite haunts--Cape Dundas, Melville Island--might be seen a\r\ncomplete highway, three yards broad, which the tread of their numbers\r\nhad beaten through the snow. In winter they seek their food and burrow\r\nfor protection under the snow-crust. Captain M’Clintock states that\r\nthey are ubiquitous in the Polar Regions, but that, of course, they\r\nare most numerous where the pasture is most abundant, as on Banks\r\nLand and Melville Island. The sportsmen of the two discovery ships,\r\n_Resolute_ and _Intrepid_, shot one hundred and sixty-one\r\nhares in a twelvemonth on Melville Island; their average weight, when\r\nfit for the table, was seven pounds, and from ten to twelve pounds\r\nincluding skin and offal.\r\n\r\nIn the warm brief summer the hare takes refuge from the pursuit of\r\nbeasts of prey under large boulders, or in the steep face of rocky\r\nravines. It is then found in groups of from twelve to twenty. So\r\ndelicate is their skin, that though the winter fur is of exceeding\r\nbeauty and brilliant whiteness, it cannot be applied to any purpose of\r\nutility. They do not hibernate; and our explorers generally found them\r\namongst the heavy hummocks of the floe-ice, as if they fled to that\r\nrugged ground from the wolves or foxes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the range of the Altaï, and extending even into Kamtschatka, we\r\nmeet with the Alpine Hare (_Lagomys Alpinus_); a small rodent,\r\nscarcely exceeding a guinea-pig in size, and measuring in length nine\r\ninches only: it has a long head, with short, broad, and rounded ears.\r\nIts favourite places of sojourn are among the rocks and cataracts of\r\nwild wooded regions, where it forms burrows beneath the rocks, or\r\ninhabits their fissures. When the sky is bright, and the sunshine\r\ngenial, they seldom leave their holes in the daytime; but in dull\r\nweather they may be seen bounding among the rocks, and making the\r\nechoes resound with their low whistle or bird-like chirp. In the autumn\r\nthey make ready against winter need by collecting a large assortment\r\nof the most nutritious herbs and grasses, which, after drying in the\r\nsun, they arrange in heaps of various sizes, according to the number\r\nof animals engaged in the task; and as these heaps are often several\r\nfeet in height and breadth, they may be easily distinguished even\r\nthrough the deep snow, and frequently prove of great service to the\r\nSiberian sable-hunters, whose horses would perish but for the supplies\r\nthus strangely afforded. Hence, wherever a Siberian or a Tartar\r\ntribe is found, the Alpine hare possesses a distinctive name,--and,\r\nnotwithstanding its diminutiveness, is highly valued.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother rodent which deserves to be remembered in these pages, is the\r\nArctic or Hudson Bay Lemming (_Myodus lemmus_), which is found in\r\nLabrador, and on all the American mainland washed by the cold waters of\r\nthe Arctic Ocean. It has been described as “a perfect diamond edition\r\nof the guinea-pig.” In habits it resembles the hare very closely,\r\nexcept that it is more gregarious, and is generally found in large\r\nfamilies. In summer it is of an ashy colour, with a tawny tinge on the\r\nback, a dusky streak along its middle, and a pale stripe on either\r\nside. It has the repute of being exceedingly inoffensive; and is tamed\r\nso easily that, when caught, it becomes reconciled to its captivity\r\nin a day or two, and will soon show itself sensible of its master’s\r\ncaresses. In winter it is perfectly white,--white as snow, from which\r\nit can be distinguished only by the keen scent of the fox or the Eskimo\r\ndog.\r\n\r\nAbout the end of May, or early in June, it leaves the land and\r\nseeks the floating ice; for what purpose does not seem as yet to be\r\naccurately ascertained. Is it due to an instinct of migration, such\r\nas the Norwegian lemming so powerfully exhibits? It may be that the\r\nthaws force them from the land, or that, as the seamen say, “Them\r\nblessed little lemmings must be arter salt!” They have often been found\r\nsteering off shore from the north coast of Melville Island, leaving\r\ncomparative plenty in their rear; and, so far as could be made out,\r\non a clear day, from land of considerable height, there was nothing\r\nin the shape of _terra firma_ in the direction they were taking.\r\nWhen thus exposed upon the open floe, owls, gulls, and foxes pick them\r\nup for food. Can it be that Providence occasions, or has ordained this\r\nexodus for the purpose of feeding these creatures, and of thinning down\r\nthe numbers of an animal which would otherwise multiply exceedingly,\r\nand devour all the vegetation of a naturally barren region?\r\n\r\nFrom an Arctic journal it would appear that the lemmings are preyed\r\nupon by the Polar bear. We transcribe a graphic passage in further\r\nillustration of the habits of that remarkable carnivore:--\r\n\r\n“Seeing some drift-wood lying about,” says a gallant navigator, “which\r\nit was important should be examined, I halted and encamped, dispersing\r\nthe men along the beach to bring all in they could find. Walking\r\nlandward to obtain a view from a hill, I was startled to see a she-bear\r\nand two cubs some distance inland. Watching them carefully, I was not\r\na little interested to see the mother applying her gigantic muscular\r\npower to turning over the large blocks of sandstone which strewed\r\nthe plain, and under which the unlucky lemmings at this season take\r\nshelter. Directly the she-bear lifted the stones, which she did by\r\nsitting upon her hams and pulling them towards her with her fore paws,\r\nthe cubs rushed in and seized their prey, tossing them up in the air\r\nin their wantonness. After repeating this operation until the young\r\nfry must have made a very good meal, I was glad to witness the bear’s\r\nmode of suckling her young--a sight, I should think, rarely seen.\r\nSeated on her haunches, with the backbone arched, so as to bring the\r\nbreasts (which were situated between the shoulders) as low as possible,\r\nthe youngsters sucked away in a standing attitude. Anxious to secure\r\nthis family-party, we proceeded to burn all sorts of strong-smelling\r\narticles; and at last she brought her babes down, though very warily,\r\nand when more than one hundred yards off turned away, evidently\r\nsuspicious.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the sub-Arctic regions are found some of those animals which furnish\r\ncommerce with the costliest furs. They all belong, however, to the\r\nfamily _Mustelidæ_, represented in temperate climes by the common\r\nweasel (_Musteles_).\r\n\r\nThe marten of North America is, in fact, the cousin-german of the\r\nweasel, and not less ferocious in its habits. In the forests of fir\r\nand birch which it loves to frequent, it preys upon the small rodents,\r\nthe birds, and, if its appetite is very keen, upon the reptiles. It\r\nscales trees as nimbly as the cat; and its flexible body enables it\r\nto insinuate itself into the smallest openings, where a cat could\r\nnot pass, and into the burrows and hollows of the trees or rocks in\r\nwhich its victims seek shelter. It is, however, a pretty animal, with\r\nvivacious ways, an astute physiognomy, and a rich coat of fur.\r\n\r\nIn the wooded zone which borders on the desert region of the Polar\r\nWorld are found both the Pine Marten (_Mustela martes_) and\r\nPennant’s Marten (_Mustela Canadensis_). The fur of the former\r\nis of a very superior quality, and its skin forms a great article of\r\ncommerce. It burrows in the ground, and feeds upon mice, rabbits, and\r\npartridges. The Canadian marten is larger than the preceding; longer\r\nand stronger. It lives in the woods, preferring damp places to dry; and\r\nclimbs with a remarkable amount of ease and dexterity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Sable (_Mustela zibellina_) is much more highly esteemed for\r\nits fur than any other of the weasel tribe. It has long whiskers,\r\nrounded ears, large feet (the soles of which are covered with fur),\r\nwhite claws, and a long bushy tail. The general colour of the fur is\r\nbrown, more or less brilliant, but the lower parts of the throat and\r\nneck are grayish.\r\n\r\nA vivacious and nimble animal is the sable, which dwells in the\r\nremotest recesses of the forests, beneath the roots of trees, and in\r\nholes of the earth, and penetrates to the very borders of the realm\r\nof perpetual snow. Prodigious numbers are killed in Siberia, during\r\nthe months of November, December, and January. The hunters assemble in\r\nlarge companies, and make their way down the great rivers in boats,\r\ncarrying sufficient supplies of provisions for a three months’ absence.\r\nOn reaching the appointed place of rendezvous, the different companies,\r\neach under the direction of a leader, fix upon their respective\r\nquarters, erect huts of trees, and build up the snow around them. In\r\nthe neighbourhood of these they lay their snares; and then, advancing\r\nanother mile or so, they set a further quantity; and thus they proceed,\r\nuntil they have covered a considerable area of ground; building huts\r\nin each locality, and returning in due order to each set of snares to\r\ncollect their prey. These snares are of the simplest construction;\r\nnothing more than small pits or cavities, loosely covered with rough\r\nplanks or branches of trees, and baited with fish or flesh. When the\r\ngame grows scarce, the trappers follow the sable to their retreats by\r\ntracking their footprints over the fresh-fallen snow; place nets at\r\ntheir entrances; and quietly wait, if it be for two or three days,\r\nuntil the animals make their appearance.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE ERMINE AND SABLE MARTEN.]\r\n\r\nThe fur of the sable is distinguished from all other furs by this\r\nsingular property: the hair has no particular inclination, but may be\r\nlaid down indifferently in any direction whatever.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe genus Polecat (_Mustela putarius_) comprehends the smallest\r\nof all known carnivores,--namely, the weasel, the ferret, and the\r\nermine. The temperate countries of Europe possess a variety of the\r\nlatter species; but the ermines of the remote North yield the fullest\r\nand softest fur. These animals, like many others in high latitudes,\r\nchange the colour of their coat according to the season. They have been\r\nadopted by poets, on account of the spotless whiteness of their fur, as\r\nemblematic of purity; but, in truth, they merit that honour only in the\r\nwinter: in the summer their colour is a clear maroon. The tail, at all\r\ntimes, is of a beautiful brilliant black.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE GLUTTON, OR WOLVERINE.]\r\n\r\nAnother carnivorous quadruped which haunts the northern forests is\r\nthe Glutton (_Gulo Arcticus_), or Wolverine; it owes its former\r\nand more popular name to its extreme voracity. But it is at least as\r\nremarkable for its strength and fierceness, inasmuch as it does not\r\nfear to dispute their prey with the wolf and bear; and for its cunning,\r\nsince it baffles again and again the most carefully devised stratagems\r\nof the hunter. It is a slow and somewhat unwieldy animal; but it is\r\ndetermined and persevering, and will proceed at a steady pace for miles\r\nin search of prey, stealing unawares upon hares, marmots, and birds;\r\nand surprising even the larger quadrupeds, such as the elk and the\r\nreindeer, when asleep.\r\n\r\nThe stories told of this remarkable animal’s shrewdness, which far\r\nexceeds that commonly attributed to the fox, would seem incredible,\r\nwere they not confirmed by good authority. It is in allusion to its\r\nextraordinary cunning that the Indians call it _Kekwaharkess_, or\r\nthe “Evil One.” With an energy that never flags it hunts day and night\r\nfor the trail of men, which, when found, it follows up unerringly.\r\nOn coming to a lake, where the track is generally drifted over, it\r\ncontinues its steady gallop round the shores, to discover the point at\r\nwhich the track re-enters the woods, when it again pursues it until it\r\narrives at one of the wooden traps set for the marten or the mink,\r\nthe ermine or the musk-rat. Cautiously avoiding the door, it effects\r\nviolent entrance at the back, and seizes the bait with impunity;\r\nor, if the trap contains an animal, drags it out, and, with wanton\r\nmalevolence, mauls it, and hides it at some distance in the underwood\r\nor at the top of some lofty pine. If hard pressed by hunger, it\r\ndevours the victim. And in this manner it demolishes the whole series\r\nof traps; so that when once a wolverine has established itself on a\r\ntrapping-walk, the hunter’s only chance of success is to change his\r\nground, and build a fresh lot of traps, in the hope of securing a few\r\nfurs before the new path is discovered by his industrious enemy.\r\n\r\nSome interesting particulars of the habits and ways of the glutton are\r\nrecorded by Lord Milton and Dr. Cheadle in their lively narrative of an\r\nexpedition from the Atlantic to the Pacific (“The North-West Passage by\r\nLand”). They tell us that it is never caught in the ordinary pit-fall.\r\nOccasionally one is poisoned, or caught in a steel trap; but so great\r\nis the creature’s strength, that many traps strong enough to hold\r\nsecurely a large wolf will not retain the wolverine. When caught in\r\nthis way, it does not, like the fox and the mink, proceed to amputate\r\nthe limb, but, assisting to carry the trap with its mouth, hastens to\r\nreach a lake or river, where its progress will be unimpeded by trees or\r\nfallen wood. After travelling to a sufficient distance to be safe from\r\npursuit for a time, it sets to work to extricate its imprisoned limb,\r\nand very frequently succeeds in the attempt.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the glutton is killed by a gun placed so as to bear on a\r\nbait, to which is attached a string communicating with the trigger.\r\nBut a trapper assured Lord Milton and his companion, that very often\r\nthe animal had proved too cunning for him, first approaching the gun\r\nand gnawing in two the cord communicating with the trigger, and then\r\nsecurely devouring the bait.\r\n\r\nIn one instance, when all the trapper’s devices to beguile his enemy\r\nhad been seen through, and clearly foiled, he adopted the plan of\r\nplacing the gun in a tree, with the muzzle pointing vertically\r\ndownwards upon the bait. This was suspended from a branch, at such\r\na height that the animal could not secure it without jumping;\r\nand, moreover, it was completely screened by the boughs. Now,\r\nthe wolverine’s curiosity almost equals its voracity. It shows a\r\ndisposition to investigate everything; an old moccasin flung aside\r\nin the bushes, or a knife lost in the snow, must be ferreted out and\r\nexamined, and any object suspended almost out of reach generally proves\r\nirresistible as a temptation. In this instance, however, the caution\r\nof the glutton exceeded its curiosity and restrained its hunger; it\r\nclimbed the tree, cut the fastenings of the gun, which then tumbled to\r\nthe ground, and, descending, it secured the bait with impunity.\r\n\r\nLord Milton’s party were personal sufferers by, and witnesses to, the\r\nanimal’s cunning. One day, when setting out to visit their traps, they\r\nobserved the footprints of a very large wolverine which had followed\r\ntheir trail, and La Ronde, their trapper, at once exclaimed, “C’est\r\nfini, monsieur; il a cassé toutes nôtres étrappes, vous allez voir;”\r\nand so it proved. As they came to each in succession, they found it\r\nbroken open at the back, and the bait taken; and, where an animal had\r\nbeen caught, it was carried off. Throughout the whole line every one\r\nhad been demolished; and the tails were discovered of no fewer than ten\r\nmartens, the bodies of which had apparently been devoured by the hungry\r\nand astute wolverine.\r\n\r\nWith one more illustration we must be content, and turn to another\r\nbranch of our subject, though we do not suppose that our readers\r\nwill weary of the relation of facts which throw so vivid a light on\r\nthe intelligence, as distinct from, and superior to, the instinct of\r\nanimals. And, certainly, the manner in which the glutton foils the\r\ningenious stratagems of the trappers must be ascribed to intelligence\r\nrather than to instinct. In the following anecdote we think it is\r\nplainly shown that the latter could not have sufficed to guard the\r\nanimal against the machinations of its persevering foes.\r\n\r\nDr. Cheadle, accompanied by an Indian boy, named Misquapasnayoo,\r\nstarted off for the woods, bent upon proving his superior acuteness\r\nto the wolverine. They found that the latter had renewed his visits\r\nalong the line of traps, and broken all which had been reconstructed,\r\ndevouring the animals found in them. Dr. Cheadle thereupon adopted a\r\ndevice which could not fail, he thought, to catch his enemy in his own\r\ntoils. All the broken traps were repaired and set again, and poisoned\r\nbaits substituted for the ordinary ones in the traps; not in every\r\ninstance, but here and there along the line.\r\n\r\nThe forest was here of great extent, and seemed to stretch away to the\r\nfrozen North without let or hindrance, the mass of timber being broken\r\nonly by numerous lakes and swamps, or clearances which had been caused\r\nby conflagrations. The traveller always seeks the lakes; not only\r\nbecause they enable him to travel more rapidly, and penetrate further\r\ninto the less hunted regions, but also because the edges of the lakes,\r\nand the portages between them, are favourite haunts of the fox, the\r\nfisher, and the mink. On one of these lakes a curious circumstance was\r\nnoted. The lake was about half a mile in length, and of nearly equal\r\nbreadth, but of no great depth. The water had seemingly frozen to the\r\nbottom, except at one end, where a spring bubbled up, and a hole of\r\nabout a yard in diameter existed in the ice-crust, which was there only\r\na few inches thick. In this hole the water was crowded with myriads\r\nof small fish, most of them not much larger than a man’s finger, and\r\nso closely packed that they could not move freely. On thrusting in an\r\narm, it seemed like plunging it into “a mass of thick stir-about.” All\r\naround the snow had been trodden down hard and level by the feet of the\r\nnumerous animals attracted to this Lenten banquet; and tracks converged\r\nto it from every side. The footprints could be recognized of the cross\r\nor silver fox, delicately impressed in the snow as he trotted daintily\r\nalong with light and airy tread; the rough marks of the clumsier\r\nfisher; the clear and sharply-defined track of the nimble mink; and the\r\ngreat cross trail of the ubiquitous glutton. On the trees around scores\r\nof crows were sleepily digesting their abundant meals.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Cheadle and his companion turned homewards, they found that\r\ntheir enemy had been in active pursuit. Along the ground they had\r\ntraversed on the previous day, every trap was already demolished, and\r\nall the baits were abstracted. Dr. Cheadle at first imagined that he\r\nhad at last outwitted and destroyed his enemy; but the Indian’s keener\r\neyes discovered each of the baits which had been poisoned, lying\r\nclose at hand, bitten in two and rejected, while all the others had\r\ndisappeared. The baits, nevertheless, had been very carefully prepared;\r\nthe strychnine being inserted into the centre of the meat by a small\r\nhole, and when frozen it was impossible to distinguish them from the\r\nharmless ones by any peculiarity of appearance. It seemed as if the\r\nanimal suspected poison, and bit in two and tasted every morsel before\r\nswallowing it. The baits had purposely been made very small, so that\r\nin the ordinary course they would have been swallowed whole. That the\r\nsame wolverine had followed up their path from the first, they knew\r\nperfectly well, because it was one of unusually large size, as shown\r\nby its tracks, which were readily distinguished from those of smaller\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of Birds in the Polar Regions, is a subject on which\r\nit seems desirable to offer a few remarks, so that our readers may be\r\nable to form an accurate conception of the character and variety of the\r\nanimal life peculiar to them.\r\n\r\nOf the birds of Greenland and Iceland, it may be affirmed that fully\r\nthree-fourths of the species, and a still larger proportion of\r\nindividuals, are more or less aquatic, and many of the remainder are\r\nonly summer visitors. The largest bird that ventures far north is the\r\n_Aquila albicilla_, or fishing-eagle, which builds its eyrie on\r\nthe loftiest crags of the ocean-cliffs, and feeds on salmon and trout.\r\nThe _Falco Islandicus_, or gyrfalcon, though a native of Iceland,\r\nis now very rarely met with. The snowy owl inhabits the glaciers which\r\nfill the deep inland valleys of Greenland, and its range extends as\r\nfar southwards as the Orkneys. Particular kinds of grouse are confined\r\nto the high latitudes; and more particularly the ptarmigan, or white\r\ngrouse, which supplies a welcome addition to the scanty bill of fare\r\nof the Arctic navigators. It is found, even in the depths of winter,\r\non Melville Island; burrowing under the snow, perhaps, for warmth,\r\nprotection, and food. But it appears to be most numerous in April, when\r\nit is found in pairs; in September it collects in coveys, sometimes\r\nof as many as fifteen or twenty birds, preparatory to their southern\r\nmigration.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PTARMIGAN.]\r\n\r\nOf the _Corvidæ_, the only species which ventures beyond the\r\nArctic Circle is the Royston crow, and that only in summer.\r\n\r\nThe raven, however, is found in all the wide Polar realm, and is\r\nlarger, stronger, and more voracious in the Arctic Islands than\r\nelsewhere. It drives the eider-ducks from their nests in order to prey\r\non their young or feast on their eggs, and it unites in flocks to expel\r\nintruding birds from their abode.\r\n\r\nThe _Grallatores_ are more numerous than land-birds in the Arctic\r\nWorld. The snipe and the golden plover are only visitors; but the\r\noyster-catcher is a denizen of Iceland, where, building its nest on\r\nthe reedy banks of the streams, it wages war with the crow tribe.\r\nThe heron, curlew, plover, and most of the other waders, emigrate;\r\nsand-pipers and the water-ousel remain “all the year round.”\r\n\r\nThe _Cygnus musicus_, or whistling swan, is specially famous for\r\nits migrations. It measures five feet from the tip of the bill to the\r\nend of the tail, and eight feet across its noble extended wings; its\r\nplumage is white as snow, with a slight tinge of orange or yellow on\r\nthe head. Some of these swans winter in Iceland; and in the long Arctic\r\nnight their song, as they pass in flocks, falls on the ear of the\r\nlistener like the notes of a violin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe distribution of animals is, of course, regulated by laws analogous\r\nto those which regulate the distribution of plants, insects, birds,\r\nand fishes. Each continent, and even different portions of the same\r\ncontinent, are the centres of zoological families, which have always\r\nexisted there, and nowhere else; each group being almost always\r\nspecifically different from all others. As the Arctic World includes\r\na district common to Europe, Asia, and America, with uniform climatic\r\nconditions, the animals inhabiting the high latitudes of these\r\ncontinents are frequently very similar and sometimes identical; and,\r\nin fact, no genus of quadrupeds exists in the Arctic regions that is\r\nnot found in all three continents, though there are only twenty-seven\r\nspecies common to all, and these mostly fur-bearing animals. The\r\ncarnivores, as we have seen, are very few in number, and of these the\r\nmost important is the Polar bear. Of the herbivores the reindeer is\r\nthe most valuable; its southern limit in Europe is the Baltic Sea, in\r\nAmerica the latitude of Quebec.\r\n\r\nThere are fully eight varieties of American dogs, several of which\r\nare natives of the far North. The _lagopus_, or isatis, a native\r\nof Spitzbergen and Greenland, extends over all the Arctic regions of\r\nAmerica and Asia, and is found in some of the Kurile Islands. Dogs are\r\nemployed to draw sledges in Newfoundland and Canada; and the Eskimo\r\ndogs, used for this purpose by the Arctic explorers, are famous for\r\ntheir strength, their docility, and power of endurance. They were mute,\r\nuntil they learned to bark from European dogs on board the discovery\r\nships.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                      ICELAND AND THE ICELANDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust within the Arctic region, but nearly on the limits of what\r\ngeographers call the Atlantic Ocean, lies an island which, since\r\nits colonization in the ninth century, has not ceased to excite the\r\ninterest of the explorer and the man of science.\r\n\r\nIceland--which measures about 300 miles at its greatest length, from\r\neast to west, and about 200 miles at its greatest breadth, from north\r\nto south--is situated in lat. 63° 23’-66° 33’ N., and long. 13° 22’-24°\r\n35’ W.; at a distance of 600 miles from the nearest point of Norway,\r\n250 from the Faröe Isles, 250 from Greenland, and above 500 miles from\r\nthe northern extremity of Scotland. As early as the eighth Christian\r\ncentury it was discovered by some European emigrants; though, indeed,\r\nthe Landnana Book, one of the earliest of the island-records, asserts\r\nthat they found the memorials of a yet earlier settlement in various\r\nChristian relics, such as wooden crosses, which appeared to be of\r\nIrish origin. At all events, the first really successful attempt at\r\ncolonization was made by Ingolf, a Norwegian, who planted himself and\r\nhis followers at Reikiavik in 874. In the following century a somewhat\r\nextensive immigration took place of Norwegians who resented the changes\r\nof polity introduced by Harold Haarfager, and all the habitable\r\npoints on the coast were occupied by about 950 A.D. Fifty\r\nyears afterwards, though not without much opposition, Christianity\r\nwas legally established, and the bishoprics of Holar and Skalholt\r\nwere founded. The government assumed the character of an aristocratic\r\nrepublic, with a popular assembly, called the Althing, meeting every\r\nsummer in the valley of Thingvalla. Commerce was encouraged, and the\r\nIcelanders early distinguished themselves by the boldness of their\r\nmaritime enterprise, and the extent of their ocean fisheries.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 932 they discovered Greenland, and about 986 a portion\r\nof the North American coast, which they called “Vineland.” They did not\r\nconfine their voyages to the north, but sent their ships even as far\r\nsouth as the Mediterranean. From 1150 to 1250 is rightly considered the\r\nmost flourishing period of Icelandic literature and commerce. After the\r\nconquest of the island by Haco VI. of Norway, much of the old spirit\r\nseemed to die out. When Norway was united to Denmark in 1380, Iceland\r\nwas included in the bond, and it is still regarded as a dependency of\r\nthe latter kingdom. In 1540 it embraced the principles of Lutheran\r\nProtestantism. Its population at one time numbered 100,000, but it\r\ngradually diminished until, in 1840, it was reduced to 57,094; but a\r\nslow increase has taken place of late years, and it now amounts to\r\nabout 70,000. The language spoken is the old Norse.\r\n\r\nIceland is a fifth part larger than Ireland, and its superficial\r\narea is estimated at 39,207 square miles. Not more than 4000 miles,\r\nhowever, are habitable, all the rest being ice and lava; for the island\r\nseems to be little more than a mass of trachyte, snow-shrouded and\r\nfrost-bound, resting on a sea of fire. It consists of two vast parallel\r\ntable-lands, the foundations of ranges of lofty mountains, most of\r\nwhich are active volcanoes; and these table-lands strike across the\r\ncentre of the island, from north-east to south-west, at a distance from\r\none another of ninety to one hundred miles. Their mountainous summits\r\nare not pyramidal, as is generally the case in Europe, but rounded like\r\ndomes, as in the Andes of South America. Their sides, however, are\r\nbroken up by precipitous masses of tufa and conglomerate, intersected\r\nby deep ravines of the gloomiest character. They are covered with a\r\nthick shroud of ice and snow, but in their wombs seethe the fiery\r\nelements which ever and anon break forth into terrible activity. The\r\neastern table-land and its mountain range is the most extensive, and\r\ncontains Oërafa, the culminating point of Iceland. It is visible from a\r\ngreat distance at sea, like a white cloud suspended above the island.\r\nIts height is 6426 feet, and it springs from a vast mountain-mass; no\r\nfewer than 3000 square miles being perpetually burdened with ice and\r\nsnow, at an altitude varying from 3000 to 6000 feet.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: AN ICELANDIC LANDSCAPE.]\r\n\r\nA very considerable portion of the island is occupied by the large\r\nglaciers which descend from the mountains, like frozen torrents,\r\npushing forward into the lowlands, and even to the margin of the sea.\r\nThese act as almost impassable barriers to communication between the\r\nvarious inhabited districts.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of the two ranges of table-lands as about ninety to\r\none hundred miles apart. The interspace forms a low broad valley,\r\nwhich opens at either extremity on the sea--an awful waste, a region\r\nof desolation, where man is utterly powerless; where the elements of\r\nfire and frost maintain a perpetual antagonism; where blade of grass\r\nis never seen, nor drop of water; where bird never wings its way, and\r\nno sign of life can be detected. It seems a realization of Dante’s\r\n“circle of ice” in the “Inferno.” The surface consists of lava streams,\r\nfissured by innumerable crevices; of rocks piled on rocks; of dreary\r\nglaciers, relieved by low volcanic cones. It is supposed that some\r\nremote portions of the inaccessible interior are less barren, because\r\nherds of reindeer have been seen feeding on the Iceland moss that\r\nfringes the borders of this dreary region. But there is no reason to\r\nbelieve that it can ever be inhabited by man.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MOUNT HEKLA, FROM THE VALLEY OF HEVITA.]\r\n\r\nThe extremities of the valleys, where they approach the ocean, are\r\nthe principal theatres of volcanic activity. At the northern end the\r\nbest-known volcano is that of Hekla, which has attained a sinister\r\nrepute from the terrific character of its eruptions. Of these\r\nsix-and-twenty are recorded, the last having occurred in 1845–46. One\r\nlasted for six years, spreading devastation over a country which had\r\nformerly been the seat of a prosperous colony, burying the fields\r\nbeneath a flood of lava, scoriæ, and ashes. During the eruption of\r\nSeptember 2, 1845, to April 1846, three new craters were formed,\r\nfrom which columns of fire sprang to the height of 14,000 feet. The\r\nlava accumulated in formidable hills, and fragments of scoriæ and\r\npumice-stone, weighing two hundredweight, were thrown to a distance\r\nof a league and a half; while the ice and snow which had lain on the\r\nmountain for centuries were liquefied, and poured down into the plains\r\nin devastating torrents.\r\n\r\nBut the eruption of another of these terrible volcanoes, the Skaptá\r\nJokul, which broke out on the 8th of May 1783, and lasted until\r\nAugust, was of a still more awful character. At that time the volcanic\r\nfire under Europe must have raged most violently, for a tremendous\r\nearthquake shattered a wide extent of Calabria in the same year, and\r\na submarine volcano had flamed fiercely for many weeks in the ocean,\r\nthirty miles from the south-west cape of Iceland.\r\n\r\nIts fires ceased suddenly; a series of earthquakes shook the island;\r\nand then Skaptá broke forth into sudden and destructive activity.\r\n\r\nFor months the sun was hidden by dense clouds of vapour, and clouds of\r\nvolcanic dust were carried many hundreds of miles to sea, extending\r\neven to England and Holland. Sand and ashes, raised to an enormous\r\nheight in the atmosphere, spread in all directions, and overwhelmed\r\nthousands of acres of fertile pasturage. The sulphurous exhalations\r\nblighted the grass of the field, and tainted the waters of river, lake,\r\nand sea, so that not only the herds and flocks perished, but the fish\r\ndied in their poisoned element.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of matter ejected by the rent and shivered mountain was\r\ncomputed at fifty or sixty thousand millions of cubic yards. The molten\r\nlava flowed in a stream which in some places was twenty to thirty\r\nmiles in breadth, and of enormous thickness; a seething, hissing\r\ntorrent, which filled the beds of rivers, poured into the sea nearly\r\nfifty miles from its points of eruption, and destroyed the fishing\r\non the coast. Some of the island-rivers were heated, it is said, to\r\nebullition; others were dried up; the condensed vapour fell in whirls\r\nof snow and storms of rain. But dreadful as was the eruption itself,\r\nwith its sublime but awful phenomena, far more dreadful were its\r\nconsequences. The country within its range was one wide ghastly desert,\r\na fire-blighted wilderness; and, partly from want of food, partly owing\r\nto the unwholesome condition of the atmosphere, no fewer than 9336\r\nmen,[10] 28,000 horses, 11,461 cattle, and 190,000 sheep, were swept\r\naway in the short space of two years. Even yet Iceland has scarcely\r\nrecovered from the blow.\r\n\r\nAt the northern end of the great central valley the focus of igneous\r\nphenomena is found in a semicircle of volcanic heights which slope\r\ntowards the eastern shore of the Lake Myvatr. Two of these are very\r\nformidable,--namely, Leirhnukr and Krabla on the north-east. After\r\nyears of inaction, they suddenly broke out with tremendous fury,\r\npouring such a quantity of lava into the Lake Myvatr, which measures\r\ntwenty miles in circuit, that the water was in a state of ebullition\r\nfor many days. On the sides of Mount Krabla, and at the base of this\r\ngroup of mountains, are situated various caldrons of boiling mineral\r\npitch, the ruined craters of ancient volcanoes; and from their depths\r\nare thrown up jets of the molten matter, enveloped in clouds of steam,\r\nand accompanied by loud explosions at regular intervals.\r\n\r\nBut the most singular phenomena in this singular country, where\r\nfrost and fire are continually disputing the pre-eminence, are the\r\n_Geysers_, or eruptive boiling springs. These all occur in the\r\ntrachytic formation, are characterized by their high temperature, by\r\nholding siliceous matter in solution, which they deposit in the form\r\nof siliceous sinter, and by evolving large quantities of sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen gas.\r\n\r\nUpwards of fifty geysers have been counted in the space of a few acres\r\nat the southern end of the great valley. Some are constant, some\r\nperiodical, some stagnant, some only slightly agitated. The grandest\r\nand most celebrated are the Great Geyser and Strokr, thirty-five miles\r\nnorth-west from Hekla. These, at regular intervals, hurl into the air\r\nimmense columns of boiling water, to the height of one hundred feet,\r\naccompanied by clouds of steam and deafening noises. In the case of\r\nthe Great Geyser, the jet issues from a shaft about seventy-five feet\r\ndeep, and ten in diameter, which opens into the centre of a shallow\r\nbasin, about one hundred and fifty feet in circumference. The basin is\r\nalternately emptied and filled: when filled, loud explosions are heard,\r\nthe ground quivers, and the boiling water is forced upwards in gigantic\r\ncolumns. Thus the basin is emptied, and the explosions cease until it\r\nis refilled.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Descloiseaux and Bunsen, who, according to Mrs. Somerville,\r\nvisited Iceland in 1846, found the temperature of the Great Geyser, at\r\nthe depth of seventy-two feet, to equal 260° 30’ F. prior to a great\r\neruption, reduced, after the eruption, to 251° 30’ F.; an interval of\r\ntwenty-eight hours passing in silence.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE GREAT GEYSER.]\r\n\r\nAbout one hundred and forty yards distant is the Strokr (from\r\n_stroka_, to agitate), a circular well, forty-four feet deep,\r\nwith a tube eight feet wide at its mouth, diminishing to little more\r\nthan ten inches at a depth of twenty-seven feet. The surface of the\r\nwater is in constant ebullition, while at the bottom the temperature\r\nexceeds that of boiling water by about twenty-four degrees. It appears,\r\nfrom experiments made by Donny, that water, long boiled, becomes more\r\nand more free from air, and that thus the cohesion of the particles\r\nis so much increased, that when the heat is sufficiently increased to\r\novercome that cohesion, the production of steam is so considerable and\r\nso instantaneous as to induce an explosion. In this circumstance M.\r\nDonny finds an explanation of the phenomena of the Geysers, which are\r\nin constant ebullition for many hours, until, being almost purified\r\nfrom air, the intense internal or subterranean heat overcomes the\r\ncohesion of the particles, and thus an explosion takes place.\r\n\r\nLord Dufferin describes an eruption which he witnessed on the occasion\r\nof his visit to the Geysers, but for which he waited three days. Like\r\npilgrims round some ancient shrine, he says, he and his friends kept\r\npatient watch; but the Great Geyser scarcely deigned to vouchsafe the\r\nslightest manifestation of its latent energies. Two or three times they\r\nheard a sound as of subterranean cannonading, and once an eruption to\r\nthe height of about ten feet occurred. On the morning of the fourth\r\nday a cry from the guides made them start to their feet, and with one\r\ncommon impulse rush towards the basin. The usual underground thunder\r\nhad already commenced. A violent agitation was disturbing the centre\r\nof the pool. Suddenly a dome of water lifted itself up to the height\r\nof eight or ten feet, then burst, and fell; immediately after which\r\na shining liquid column, or rather a sheaf of columns, wreathed in\r\nrobes of vapour, sprang into the air, and in a succession of jerking\r\nleaps, each higher than the last, flung their silver crests against\r\nthe sky. For a few minutes the fountain held its own, then all at once\r\nappeared to lose its ascending power. The unstable waters faltered,\r\ndrooped, fell, “like a broken purpose,” back upon themselves, and were\r\nimmediately sucked down into the recesses of their pipe.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle was one of great magnificence; but no description can\r\ngive an accurate idea of its most striking features. The enormous\r\nwealth of water, its vitality, its hidden power, the illimitable\r\nbreadth of sunlit vapour, rolling out in exhaustless profusion,--these\r\ncombine to impress the spectator with an almost painful sense of the\r\nstupendous energy of nature’s slightest movements.\r\n\r\nThe same traveller furnishes a very humorous account of the Strokr (or\r\n“churn”).\r\n\r\nIt is, he says, an unfortunate Geyser, with so little command over its\r\ntemper and stomach, that you can get a _rise_ out of it whenever\r\nyou like. Nothing more is necessary than to collect a quantity of sods\r\nand throw them down its funnel. As it has no basin to protect it from\r\nthese liberties, you can approach to the very edge of the pipe, which\r\nis about five feet in diameter, and look down at the boiling water\r\nperpetually seething at the bottom. In a few minutes the dose of turf\r\njust administered begins to disagree with it; it works itself up into\r\n“an awful passion;” tormented by the qualms of incipient sickness,\r\nit groans and hisses, and boils up, and spits at you with malicious\r\nvehemence, until at last, with a roar of mingled pain and rage, it\r\nthrows up into the air a column of water forty feet high, carrying with\r\nit all the sods that have been thrown in, and scattering them, scalded\r\nand half-digested, at your feet. So irritated has the poor thing’s\r\nstomach become by the discipline it has undergone, that even long\r\nafter all foreign matter has been thrown off, it continues retching\r\nand sputtering, until at last nature is exhausted, when, sobbing and\r\nsighing to itself, it sinks back into the bottom of its den.\r\n\r\nThe ground around the Geysers, for about a quarter of a mile, looks\r\nas if it had been “honeycombed by disease into numerous sores and\r\norifices;” not a blade of grass grew on its hot, inflamed surface,\r\nwhich consisted of unwholesome-looking red livid clay, or crumpled\r\nshreds and shards of slough-like incrustations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA region, corresponding in character to the desert mountain-mass we\r\nhave been describing, stretches westward from it to the extremity of\r\nthe ridge of the Snaefield Syssel, and terminates in the remarkable\r\ncone of Snaefield Jokul.\r\n\r\nThe island coasts exhibit a singularly broken outline, and the deep\r\nlochs or fiords, like those of Norway, only less romantic, dip into the\r\ninterior for many miles, and throw off numerous branches. These fiords\r\nare wild and gloomy; dark, still inlets, with precipices on either\r\nside, a thousand feet in height, and the silence unbroken, save by the\r\noccasional wash of the waters, or the scream of a solitary ocean-bird.\r\nInland, however, they assume a gentler character: they end in long\r\nnarrow valleys, watered by pleasant streams, and bright with pasture.\r\nIn these bits of Arcadia the inhabitants have built their towns and\r\nvillages.\r\n\r\nIn the valleys on the north coast, which are adorned by clumps of\r\nwillow and juniper, the soil is comparatively fertile; but the most\r\ngenial scenery is found on the east, where, in some places, the\r\nbirch-trees reach a height of twenty feet, and are of sufficient size\r\nto be used in house-building. The fuel used by the Icelanders is the\r\ndrift-wood which the Gulf Stream brings from Mexico, the Carolinas,\r\nVirginia, and the River St. Lawrence.\r\n\r\nIn the south of the island the mean temperature is about 39°; in the\r\ncentral districts, 36°; in the north it rarely rises above 32°, or\r\nfreezing-point. Thunder-storms, though rare in high latitudes, are not\r\nuncommon in Iceland; a circumstance which is due, no doubt, to the\r\natmospheric disturbances caused by the volcanic phenomena. Hurricanes\r\nare frequent, and the days are few when the island is free from\r\nsea-mists. At the northern end the sun is always above the horizon\r\nin the middle of summer, and under it in the middle of winter; but\r\nabsolute darkness does not prevail.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting places in Iceland is Thingvalla, where of\r\nold the “Althing,” or supreme parliament, was wont to hold its annual\r\nassemblies, under the “Logmathurman,” or president of the republic.\r\n\r\nIt is nothing more than a broad plain on the bank of the River Oxerá,\r\nnear the point where the swift waters, after forming a noble cascade,\r\nsweep into the Lake of Thingvalla. Only a plain; but the scenery around\r\nit is indescribably grand and solemn. On either side lies a barren\r\nplateau, above which rises a range of snowy mountains, and from the\r\nplateaus the plain is cut off by deep chasms,--that of Almanna Gja\r\non the east, and the Hrafna Gja on the west. It measures eight miles\r\nin breadth, and its surface is covered by a network of innumerable\r\nfissures and crevices of great depth and breadth. At the foot of the\r\nplain lies a lake, about thirty miles in circumference, in the centre\r\nof which two small crater-islands, the result of some ancient eruption,\r\nare situated. The mountains on its south bank have a romantic aspect,\r\nand that their volcanic fires are not extinct is shown by the clouds\r\nof vapour evolved from the hot springs that pour down their rugged\r\nsides. The actual meeting-place of the Althing was an irregular oval\r\narea, about two hundred feet by fifty, almost entirely surrounded by a\r\ncrevice so broad and deep as to be impassable, except where a narrow\r\ncauseway connected it with the adjacent plain, and permitted access\r\nto its interior. At one other point, indeed, the encircling chasm is\r\nso narrow that it may possibly be cleared at a leap; and the story\r\nruns that one Flosi, when hotly pursued by his enemies, did in this\r\nway escape them; but as falling an inch short would mean sure death in\r\nthe green waters below, the chasm may be regarded as a tolerably sure\r\nbarrier against intruders.\r\n\r\nThe ancient capital of the island was Skalholt, where, in the eleventh\r\ncentury, was founded the first school; an episcopal seat; the\r\nbirthplace of a long line of Norse worthies, Islief the chronicler,\r\nGissur the linguist, and Finnur Johnson the historian. But its glories\r\nhave passed away; its noble cathedral has ceased to exist; and three or\r\nfour cottages alone perpetuate the name of the once flourishing city.\r\n\r\nThe present capital is Reikiavik, to which, in 1797, were transferred\r\nthe united bishoprics of Stoolum and Skalholt. It consists of a\r\ncollection of wooden sheds, one story high, rising here and there into\r\na gable end of greater pretensions, extending along a tract of dreary\r\nlava, and flanked at either end by a suburb of turf huts. On every side\r\nof it stretches a dreary lava-plain, and the gloom of the scorched and\r\nghastly landscape is unrelieved by tree or bush. The white mountains\r\nare too distant to serve as a background to the buildings, but before\r\nthe door of each merchant’s house, facing the sea, streams a bright\r\nlittle pennon; and as the traveller paces the silent streets, whose\r\ndust no carriage-wheel has ever desecrated, the rows of flower-pots\r\npeeping out of the windows, between white muslin curtains, at once\r\nconvince him that, notwithstanding their unostentatious appearance,\r\nwithin each dwelling reign “the elegance and comfort of a woman-tended\r\nhome.”\r\n\r\nThe prosperity of Reikiavik is chiefly due to its excellent harbour,\r\nand to the fish-banks in its neighbourhood, which supply it with an\r\nimportant commercial staple. In the summer and early autumn it is much\r\nvisited by tourists, who start from thence to admire the wonders of\r\nHekla, Skapta, and the Geysers; but its busiest time is in July, when\r\nthe annual fair draws thither a crowd of fisher-folk and peasants. From\r\na distance of forty and fifty leagues they come, with long trains of\r\npack-horses, their stock-fish slung loose across the animals’ backs,\r\nand their other wares packed closely in boxes or bags of reindeer-skin.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: HARBOUR OF REIKIAVIK.]\r\n\r\nThe Icelander is honest, temperate, hospitable, possessed with a\r\nfervent spirit of patriotism, and strongly wedded to the ancient\r\nusages. He is also industrious; and though his industry is but\r\nscantily remunerated, he earns enough to satisfy his simple tastes.\r\nIn the interior his chief dependence is on his cattle; and as grass\r\nis the main produce of his farm, his anxiety during the haymaking\r\nseason is extreme. A bad crop would be almost ruin. He is, however,\r\nwofully ignorant of agriculture as a science, does but little for the\r\nimprovement of the soil, and employs implements of the most primitive\r\ncharacter. The process of haymaking in Iceland is thus described:--\r\n\r\nThe best crops are gathered from the “tún,” a kind of home-park or\r\npaddock, comprising the lands contiguous to the farmstead--the only\r\nportion of his demesne to which the owner gives any special attention,\r\nand on the improvement of which he bestows any labour. This “tún” is\r\nenclosed within a wall of stone or turf, and averages an extent of\r\ntwo or three acres, though sometimes it reaches to ten. Its surface\r\nis usually a series of closely-packed mounds, like an overcrowded\r\ngraveyard, with channels or water-runs between, about two feet deep.\r\nHither every person employed on the farm, or whom the farmer can\r\nengage, resorts, with short-bladed scythe and rake, and proceeds to cut\r\ndown the coarse thick grass, and rake it up into little heaps.\r\n\r\nAfterwards the mowers hasten to clear the neighbouring hill sides and\r\nundrained marshes.\r\n\r\nThis primitive haymaking, so unlike the systematic operation which\r\nbears that name in England, is carried on throughout the twenty-four\r\nhours of the long summer day. The hay, when sufficiently dried, is\r\nmade up into bundles, and tied with cords and thongs, and packed on\r\nthe back of ponies, which carry it to the clay-built stalls or sheds\r\nprepared for it. And a curious sight it is to see a long string of\r\nhay-laden ponies returning home. Each pony’s halter is made fast to the\r\ntail of his predecessor; and the little animals are so overshadowed\r\nand overwhelmed by their burdens, that their hoofs and the connecting\r\nropes alone are visible, and they seem like so many animated haycocks,\r\nfeeling themselves sufficiently made up, and leisurely betaking\r\nthemselves to their resting-places.\r\n\r\nDuring the protracted winter the Icelander, of course, can attend to no\r\nout-of-door labour, and passes his time within his hut, which, in many\r\nparts of the island, is not much superior to an Irish “cabin.”\r\n\r\nThe lower part is built of rough stones up to a height of four feet,\r\nand between each course a layer of turf is placed, which serves instead\r\nof mortar, and helps to keep out the cold. The roof, made of any\r\navailable wood, is covered with turf and sods. On the southern side\r\nthe building is ornamented with doors and gable-ends, each of which\r\nis crowned by a weathercock. These doors are the entrances to the\r\ndwelling-rooms and various offices, such as the cow-shed, store-house,\r\nand smithy. The dwelling-rooms are connected by a long, dark, narrow\r\npassage, and are separated from each other by strong walls of turf.\r\nAs each apartment has its own roof, the building is, in effect, an\r\naggregate of several low huts, which receive their light through small\r\nwindows in the front, or holes in the roof, covered with a piece of\r\nglass or skin. The floors are of stamped earth; the fireplace is made\r\nof a few stones, rudely packed together, while the smoke escapes\r\nthrough a hole in the roof, or through a cask or barrel, with the ends\r\nknocked out, which acts as chimney.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the island lava is used instead of stones, and instead\r\nof wood the rafters are made of the ribs of whales. A horse’s skull is\r\nthe best seat provided for a visitor. Too often the same room serves\r\nas the dining, sitting, and sleeping place for the whole family, and\r\nthe beds are merely boxes filled with feathers or sea-weed. There\r\nare, however, a few houses of a superior character, in which the\r\narrangements are not much unlike those of a good old-fashioned English\r\nfarm-house; the walls being wainscotted with deal, and the doors and\r\nstaircase of the same material. A few prints and photographs, some\r\nbook-shelves, one or two little pictures, decorate the sitting-room,\r\nand a neat iron stove, and massive chests of drawers, furnish it\r\nsufficiently.\r\n\r\nFrom the houses we turn to the churches. In Reikiavik the church is\r\na stone building, the only stone building in the town; but this is\r\nexceptional: most of the churches are not much better than the houses.\r\nWe will be content, therefore, with a visit to the Reikiavik sanctuary,\r\nwhich is a neat and unpretending erection, capable of accommodating\r\nthree or four hundred persons. The Icelanders are not opposed to a\r\n“decent ritual,” and the Lutheran minister wears a black gown with\r\na ruff round his neck. The majority of the congregation, here as\r\neverywhere else, consists of women; some few dressed in bonnets, and\r\nthe rest wearing the national black silk skull-cap, set jauntily on one\r\nside of the head, with a long black tassel drooping to the shoulder, or\r\nelse a quaint mitre-like structure of white linen, almost as imposing\r\nas the head-dress of a Normandy peasant. The remainder of an Icelandic\r\nlady’s costume, we may add, consists of a black bodice, fastened in\r\nfront with silver clasps, over which is drawn a cloth jacket, gay with\r\ninnumerable silver buttons; round the neck goes a stiff ruff of velvet,\r\nembroidered with silver lace; and a silver belt, often beautifully\r\nchased, binds the long dark wadmal petticoat round the waist. Sometimes\r\nthe ornaments are of gold, instead of silver, and very costly.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the Lutheran service, the preacher descends from the\r\npulpit, and attiring himself in a splendid crimson velvet cope, turns\r\nhis back to the congregation, and chants some Latin sentences.\r\n\r\nThough still retaining in their ceremonies, says a recent traveller,\r\na few vestiges of the old religion, though altars, candles, pictures,\r\nand crucifixes yet remain in many of their churches, the Icelanders are\r\nstanch Protestants, and singularly devout, innocent, and pure-hearted.\r\nCrime, theft, debauchery, cruelty are unknown amongst them; they have\r\nneither prison, gallows, soldiers, nor police; and in the manner of\r\ntheir lives mingles something of a patriarchal simplicity, that reminds\r\none of the Old World princes, of whom it has been said, that they were\r\n“upright and perfect, eschewing evil, and in their hearts no guile.”\r\n\r\nIn the rural districts, if such a phrase can properly be applied\r\nto any part of Iceland, the church is scarcely distinguishable\r\nfrom any other building, except by the cross planted on its roof.\r\nIt measures, generally, from eight to ten feet in width, and from\r\neighteen to twenty-four feet in length; but of this space about eight\r\nfeet are devoted to the altar, which is divided off by a wooden\r\npartition stretching across the church, just behind the pulpit. The\r\ncommunion-table is nothing more than a small wooden chest or cupboard,\r\nplaced at the end of the building, between two small square windows,\r\neach formed by a single common-sized pane of glass. Over the table\r\nis suspended a sorry daub, on wood, intended to represent the Last\r\nSupper. The walls, which are wainscotted, are about six feet high; and\r\nstout beams of wood stretch from side to side. On these are carelessly\r\nscattered a number of old Bibles, psalters, and loose leaves of soiled\r\nand antiquated manuscripts. The interior of the roof, the rafters of\r\nwhich rest on the walls, is also lined with wood. Accommodation, in the\r\nshape of a few rough benches, is provided for a congregation of thirty\r\nor forty souls.\r\n\r\nPoor as are the churches, the pastors are still poorer. The best\r\nbenefice in the island is worth not much more than £40 per annum; the\r\naverage value is £10. The bishop himself does not receive more than\r\n£200. The principal support of the clergy, therefore, is derived from\r\ntheir glebe-land, eked out by the small fees charged for baptisms,\r\nmarriages, and funerals.\r\n\r\nSuch being the case, the reader will not be surprised to learn that\r\nthe Icelandic clergy live miserably and work hard. They assist in\r\nthe haymaking; they hire themselves out as herdsmen; they act as the\r\nleaders of the caravans of pack-horses which carry the produce of the\r\nisland to the ports, and return loaded with domestic necessaries; and\r\nthey distinguish themselves as blacksmiths, as veterinarians, and\r\nshoers of horses.\r\n\r\nDr. Henderson gives an interesting and graphic account of a visit\r\nhe paid to one of these “poor parsons,” John Thorlukson, who, while\r\nsupporting himself by drudgery of this painful kind, translated\r\nMilton’s “Paradise Lost” and Pope’s “Essay on Man” into Icelandic.\r\n\r\n“Like most of his brethren, at this season of the year,” says Dr.\r\nHenderson, “we found him in the meadow assisting his people at\r\nhaymaking. On hearing of our arrival he made all the haste home which\r\nhis age and infirmity would allow, and bidding us welcome to his lowly\r\nabode, ushered us into the humble apartment where he translated my\r\ncountrymen into Icelandic. The door was not quite four feet in height,\r\nand the room might be about eight feet in length by six in breadth. At\r\nthe inner end was the poet’s bed; and close to the door, over against\r\na small window, not exceeding two feet square, was a table where he\r\ncommitted to paper the effusions of his muse. On my telling him that\r\nmy countrymen would not have forgiven me, nor could I have forgiven\r\nmyself, had I passed through this part of the island without paying him\r\na visit, he replied that the translation of Milton had yielded him many\r\na pleasant hour, and often given him occasion to think of England.”\r\n\r\nIt is true that this passage was written some fifty-five years ago, but\r\nthe condition of the clergy of Iceland has not much improved in the\r\ninterval.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTravelling in Iceland, even under the more favourable conditions\r\nbrought about by a constant influx of tourists, is not to be achieved\r\nwithout difficulty and discomfort. Not only is the country destitute,\r\nnecessarily, of inns and the usual arrangements for the convenience\r\nof travellers, but much, very much, depends upon the weather. With a\r\nbright sky overhead, it is possible to regard as trivial and unworthy\r\nof notice the small _désagréments_ which, in bad weather, develop\r\ninto very serious annoyances. The only mode of travelling is on\r\nhorseback, for as there are no roads, carriages would be useless; while\r\nthe distances between the various points of interest are too great,\r\nthe rivers too violent, and the swamps too extensive for pedestrian\r\ntours to be undertaken. Even the most moderate-minded tourist requires\r\na couple of riding-horses for himself, a couple for his guide, and a\r\ncouple of pack-horses; and when a larger company travels, it expands\r\ninto a cavalcade of from twenty to thirty horses, tied head to tail,\r\nwhich slowly pick their way over rugged lava-beds or dangerous boggy\r\nground.\r\n\r\nIt is one thing, as Lord Dufferin remarks, to ride forty miles a day\r\nthrough the most singular scenery in the world, when a glorious sun\r\nbrings out every feature of the landscape into startling distinctness,\r\ntransmuting the dull tormented earth into towers, domes, and pinnacles\r\nof shining metal, and clothes each peak in a robe of many-coloured\r\nlight, such as the “Debatable Mountains” must have been in Bunyan’s\r\ndream; and another to plod over the same forty miles, wet to the skin,\r\nseeing nothing but the dim gray bases of the hills, which rise you\r\nknow not how, and care not where. “If, in addition to this, you have\r\nto wait, as very often must be the case, for many hours after your own\r\narrival, wet, tired, hungry, until the baggage-train, with the tents\r\nand food, shall have come up, with no alternative in the meantime but\r\nto lie shivering inside a grass-roofed house, or to share the quarters\r\nof some farmer’s family, whose domestic arrangements resemble in every\r\nparticular those which Macaulay describes as prevailing among the\r\nScottish Highlanders a hundred years ago; and if, finally, after vainly\r\nwaiting for some days to see an eruption which never takes place, you\r\njourney back to Reikiavik under the same melancholy conditions, it will\r\nnot be unnatural that, on returning to your native land, you should\r\nproclaim Iceland, with her geysers, to be a sham, a delusion, and a\r\nsnare!”\r\n\r\nThere are no bridges in Iceland; no bridges, except, indeed, a few\r\nplanks flung across the Bruera, and a swing-bridge, or kláfe, which\r\nspans the Jokülsa; and, as is still the case in some parts of the\r\nScottish Highlands, the traveller must ford the streams, which are\r\nalways rapid, and sometimes inconveniently deep. The passage of a river\r\nis, therefore, a formidable enterprise, as may be inferred from the\r\nexperiences of Mr. Holland and other travellers.\r\n\r\nThe guide leads the way, and the caravan follow obediently in his\r\nwake, stemming, as best they can, the swift impetuous torrent. Often\r\nthe boiling water rises high against the horse’s shoulders, and dashes\r\nclouds of spray in the face of the riders. The stream is so furiously\r\nfast that it is impossible to follow the individual waves as they sweep\r\nby, and to look down at it almost makes one dizzy. Now, if ever, is the\r\ntime for a firm hand, a sure seat, and a steady eye: not only is the\r\ncurrent strong, but its bed is full of large stones, which the horse\r\ncannot see through the dark waters; and should he fall, the torrent\r\nwill carry you down to the sea, whose white breakers are plainly\r\nvisible as they crawl along the resounding beach at a mile’s distance.\r\nHappily, though hungry for prey, they will not be satisfied. Swimming\r\nwould be of no use, but an “Icelandic water-horse” seldom blunders or\r\nmakes a false step. But another danger lies in the masses of ice swept\r\ndown by the whirling waves, many of which are sufficiently large to\r\ntopple over horse and rider.\r\n\r\nHow the horses are able to stand against such a stream is every\r\ntraveller’s wonder; nor would they do so unless they were inured to\r\nthe enterprise from their very youth. The Icelanders who live in the\r\ninterior keep horses known for their qualities in fording difficult\r\nrivers, and never venture to cross a dangerous stream unless mounted on\r\nan experienced “water-horse.”\r\n\r\nThe action of the Icelandic horses in crossing a swift river is very\r\npeculiar. They lean all their weight _against_ the current,\r\nso as to oppose it as much as possible, and move onwards with a\r\ncharacteristic side-step. This motion is not agreeable. It feels as if\r\nyour horse were marking time, like soldiers at drill, without gaining\r\nground, and as the progress made is really very slow, the shore from\r\nwhich you started seems to recede from you, while that to which you are\r\nbound does not seem to draw nearer.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-stream the roar of the waters is frequently so great that\r\nthe travellers cannot make their voices audible to one another. There\r\nis the swirl of the torrent, the seething of the spray, the crunching\r\nof the floating ice, the roll of stones and boulders against the\r\nbottom,--and all these sounds combine in one confused chaotic din.\r\nUp to this point, a diagonal line, rather down stream, is cautiously\r\nfollowed; but when the middle is reached, the horses’ heads are turned\r\nslightly _towards_ the current, and after much effort and many\r\nrisks the opposite bank is reached in safety.\r\n\r\nLord Dufferin says, with much truth, that the traveller in Iceland is\r\nconstantly reminded of the East. From the earliest ages the Icelanders\r\nhave been a people dwelling in tents. In the days of the ancient\r\nAlthing, the legislators, during the entire session, lay encamped\r\nin movable booths around the place of council. There is something\r\npatriarchal in their domestic polity, and the very migration of their\r\nancestors from Norway was a protest against the antagonistic principle\r\nof feudalism. No Arab could be prouder of his high-mettled steed than\r\nthe Icelander of his little stalwart, sure-footed pony: no Oriental\r\ncould pay greater attention to the duties of hospitality; while the\r\nsolemn salutation exchanged between two companies of travellers, as\r\nthey pass each other in what is universally called “the desert,” is not\r\nunworthy of the stately courtesy of the gravest of Arabian sheikhs.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to imagine anything more multifarious than the cargo\r\nwhich these caravans import into the inland districts: deal boards,\r\nrope, kegs of brandy, sacks of rye or wheaten flour, salt, soap, sugar,\r\nsnuff, tobacco, coffee; everything, in truth, which is necessary for\r\ndomestic consumption during the dreary winter season. In exchange for\r\nthese commodities the Icelanders give raw wool, knitted stockings,\r\nmittens, cured cod, fish-oil, whale-blubber, fox-skins, eider-down,\r\nfeathers, and Iceland moss. The exports of the island in wool amount\r\nto upwards of 1,200,000 lbs. of wool yearly, and 500,000 pairs of\r\nstockings and mittens.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ICELANDERS FISHING FOR NARWHAL.]\r\n\r\nIceland offers abundant sport to the enthusiast in fishing. The streams\r\nare well supplied with salmon; while the neighbouring seas abound in\r\nseals, torsk, and herrings. The narwhal-fishery is also carried on, and\r\nhas its strange and exciting features. The implement used is simply a\r\nthree-pronged harpoon, like a trident, with which the fisherman strikes\r\nat the fish as they rise to the surface; and his dexterity and coolness\r\nare so great that he seldom misses his aim.\r\n\r\nNumerous works, in English, have been written upon Iceland and the\r\nIcelanders; the most trustworthy are those by Dr. Henderson, Professor\r\nForbes, Holland, Chambers, and Lord Dufferin. The King of Denmark\r\nvisited Iceland in 1874.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n                             THE ESKIMOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe land of the Eskimos is of very wide extent. From Greenland and\r\nLabrador they range over all the coasts of Arctic America to the\r\nextreme north-eastern point of Asia. Several of the Eskimo tribes are\r\nindependent; others acknowledge the rule of Great Britain, Denmark,\r\nRussia, and more recently of the United States. The whaler meets\r\nwith them on the shores of Baffin Bay, and in the icy sea beyond\r\nBehring Straits; the explorer has tracked them as far as Smith Sound,\r\nthe highway to the North Pole; and while they descend as low as the\r\nlatitude of Vienna, they rove as far north as the 81st and 82nd\r\nparallels. They are the aborigines of the deserts of ice and snow, the\r\nancient masters of the Arctic wilderness, and all Polar America is\r\ntheir long-acknowledged domain. To a certain extent they are nomadic\r\nin their habits; compelled to migrate by the conditions of the climate\r\nin which they live, and forced to seek their scanty sustenance in a\r\nnew locality when they have exhausted the capabilities of any chosen\r\nhabitat. As Mr. Markham tells us, traces of former inhabitants are\r\nfound throughout the gloomiest wastes of the Arctic regions, in sterile\r\nand silent tracts where now only solitude prevails. These wilds, it\r\nis known, have been uninhabited for centuries; yet they are covered\r\nwith memorials of wanderers or of sojourners of a bygone age. Here and\r\nthere, in Greenland, in Boothia, on the American coast, where life is\r\npossible, the descendants of former nomads are still to be found.\r\n\r\nArctic discovery, as yet, has stopped short at about 82° on the west\r\ncoast, and 76° on the east, of Greenland. These two points are about\r\nsix hundred miles apart. There have been inhabitants at both points,\r\nthough they are separated by an uninhabitable interval from the\r\nsettlements further south; we may conclude, then, that the _terra\r\nincognita_ further north is also or has been inhabited. In 1818 it\r\nwas discovered that a small tribe of Eskimos inhabited the bleak west\r\ncoast of Greenland between 76° and 79° N. They could not penetrate\r\nto the south on account of the glaciers of Melville Bay; they could\r\nnot penetrate to the north, because all progress in that direction\r\nis forbidden by the great Humboldt glacier; while the huge interior\r\nglacier of the _Sernik-sook_ pent them in upon the narrow belt of\r\nthe sea-coast. These so-called “Arctic Highlanders” number about one\r\nhundred and forty souls, and throughout the winter their precarious\r\nlivelihood depends on the fish they catch in the open pools and\r\nwater-ways. Under similar conditions, it is probable that Eskimo tribes\r\nmay be existing still further north; or if, as geographers suppose, an\r\nopen sea really surrounds the Pole, and a warmer atmosphere prevails,\r\nthe conditions of their existence will necessarily be more favourable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore we come to speak of the characteristics of the Eskimos, we must\r\nbriefly notice the Danish settlements in Greenland, which are gradually\r\nattracting no inconsiderable number of them within the bounds of\r\ncivilization. These are dotted along the coast, like so many centres\r\nof light and life; but the most important, from a commercial point of\r\nview, are Upernavik, Jacobshav’n, and Godhav’n.\r\n\r\nUpernavik is the chief town of a district which extends from the 70th\r\nto the 74th degree of north latitude, and enjoys the distinction of\r\nbeing the most northerly civilized region in the world. Its northern\r\nboundary represents the furthest advance of civilization in its long\r\nwarfare against the Arctic climate.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: UPERNAVIK, GREENLAND.]\r\n\r\nThe town of Upernavik is situated on the summit of a mossy hill which\r\nslopes to the head of a small but sheltered harbour. It contains\r\na government-house, plastered with pitch and tar; a shop or two;\r\nlodging-houses for the Danish officials; some timber huts, inhabited\r\nby Danes; and a number of huts of stone and turf, intermingled with\r\nseal-skin tents, which accommodate the natives. Its principal evidences\r\nof civilization are its neat little church and parsonage.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants are chiefly occupied in fishing and hunting, and in\r\nthe manufacture of suitable clothing for the protection of the human\r\nframe against the winter cold. Reindeer, seal, and dog skins are deftly\r\nconverted into hoods, jackets, trousers, and boots. The last-named\r\nare triumphs of ingenuity. They are made of seal-skin, which has\r\nbeen tanned by alternate freezing and thawing; are sewed with sinew,\r\nand “crimped” and fitted to the foot with equal taste and skill. Dr.\r\nHayes informs us that the Greenland women, not exempt from the love of\r\nfinery characteristic of their sex, trim their own boots in a perfectly\r\nbewitching manner, and adopt the gayest of colours. Red boots, or\r\nwhite, trimmed with red, he says, seemed most generally worn, though\r\nthere was no more limit to the variety than to the capriciousness of\r\nthe fancy which suggested it. And it would be difficult to imagine a\r\nmore grotesque spectacle than is presented by the crowd of red, and\r\nyellow, and white, and purple, and blue-legged women who crowd the\r\nbeach whenever a strange ship enters the harbour.\r\n\r\nThe population of Upernavik numbers now about two hundred and fifty\r\nsouls; comprising some forty or fifty Danes, a larger number of\r\nhalf-breeds, the remainder being native Greenlanders,--that is, Eskimos.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DISCO ISLAND, GREENLAND.]\r\n\r\nIn describing _one_ Danish settlement we describe all, for they\r\npresent exactly the same characteristics, the difference between them\r\nbeing only a question of population.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: GODHAV’N, DISKO ISLAND, GREENLAND.]\r\n\r\nJacobshav’n and Godhav’n are situated on the island of Disko, which is\r\nseparated from the west coast of Greenland by Weygat Strait, and has\r\nbeen described as one of the most remarkable localities in the Arctic\r\nWorld. The tradition runs that it was translated from a southern region\r\nto its present position by a potent sorcerer; and an enormous hole\r\nin the rock is pointed out as the gully through which he passed his\r\nrope. It is a lofty island, and its coast is belted round by high trap\r\ncliffs, of the most imposing aspect. Near its south-west extremity,\r\nin lat. 69° S., a low rugged spur or tongue of granite projects into\r\nthe sea for about a mile and a half,--a peninsula at low water, and an\r\nisland at high water,--and forms the snug little recess of Godhav’n,\r\nor Good Harbour. To the north of the bay, in face of rocky cliffs,\r\nwhich rise perpendicularly from the sea to a height of 2000 feet, lies\r\nthe town of the same name, which our English whalers know as Lievely,\r\nprobably a corruption of the adjective _lively_; for the tiny\r\ncolony is the metropolis of Northern Greenland; and since the beginning\r\nof the present century has been the favourite rendezvous of the fishing\r\nfleets and expeditions of discovery.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFurther to the north lies Jacobshav’n, which possesses a celebrity of\r\nits own as one of the most ancient of the Moravian mission-stations in\r\nthe north of Greenland. Besides a church, it boasts of a college for\r\nthe education and training of natives who desire to be of service to\r\ntheir fellow-countrymen in the capacity of catechists or teachers. So\r\ngreat has been the industry, and so well deserved is the influence of\r\nthe missionaries, that it is difficult now to find an Eskimo woman in\r\nthis part of Greenland who cannot read and write. Prior to the Danish\r\ncolonisation of Greenland, the language of the natives was exclusively\r\noral. Only through the medium of speech could they represent their\r\nsimplest ideas; and the picture-writing of the North American Indians\r\nwas beyond their skill. But the missionaries have raised the Eskimo\r\ntongue into the rank of written languages. At Godthaab a printing-press\r\nis in full operation, and has already produced some very interesting\r\nhistorical narratives and Eskimo traditions.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DANISH SETTLEMENT OF JACOBSHAV’N, GREENLAND.]\r\n\r\nAs is the case with all the Greenland colonies, Jacobshav’n owes its\r\nprosperity to the seal-fishing. Moreover, the Greenland, or “right”\r\nwhale, in its annual migrations southward, enters the neighbouring\r\nwaters during the month of September, and furnishes employment to the\r\nfishing population.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Jacobshav’n an enormous glacier, one of the\r\noffshoots of the great central _mer de glace_ of Greenland, finds\r\nits way to the sea. Yet the temperature is said to be milder than at\r\nGodhav’n.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following remarks apply, of course, to those Eskimos who still lead\r\na nomadic life, and have profited little or nothing by the Christian\r\ncivilization of the Danish settlements and Moravian missions.\r\n\r\nAmong themselves the Eskimos are known as _Inuits_, or “men;”\r\nthe seamen of the Hudson Bay ships have long been accustomed to call\r\nthem _Seymos_ or _Suckemos_--names derived from the cries of\r\n_Seymo_ or _Teymo_ with which they hail the arrival of the\r\ntraders; while the old Norsemen designated them, in allusion to their\r\ndiscordant shouts, or by way of expressing their infinite contempt,\r\n_Skraelingers_, “screamers” or “wretches.”\r\n\r\nThe European feels impelled to pity the hard fate which condemns them\r\nto inhabit one of the dreariest and most inhospitable regions of the\r\nglobe, where only a few mosses and lichens, or plants scarcely higher\r\nin the scale of creation, can maintain a struggling existence; where\r\nland animals and birds are few in number; and where human life would be\r\nimpossible but for the provision which the ocean waters so abundantly\r\nsupply. As they live in a great degree upon fish and the cetaceans,\r\nthey dwell almost always near the coast, and never penetrate inland to\r\nany considerable distance.\r\n\r\nIn the east the Eskimos, for several centuries, have been subjected\r\nto the civilizing influences of the English and the Dutch; in the\r\nwest, they have long been under the iron rule of the Muscovite. In the\r\nnorth and the centre their intercourse with Europeans has always been\r\ncasual and inconsiderable. It will therefore be understood that the\r\ndifferent branches of this wide-spread race must necessarily exhibit\r\nsome diversity of character, and that the same description of manners\r\nand mode of life will not in all points apply with equal accuracy to\r\nthe savage and heathen Eskimos of the extreme northern shores and\r\nislands, the Greek Catholic Aleüts, the faithful servants of the Hudson\r\nBay Company, and the disciples of the Moravian Brethren in Labrador\r\nor Greenland. Yet the differences are by no means important, and it\r\nmay be doubted whether any other race, living under such peculiar\r\nconditions, and extending over so vast an area, can show so few and\r\nsuch inconsiderable specific varieties. When one thinks of an Eskimo,\r\none naturally calls up a certain image to one’s mind: that of a man of\r\nmoderate stature or under medium size, with a broad flat face, narrow\r\ntapering forehead, and narrow or more or less oblique eyes; and this\r\nimage or type will be found to be realized throughout the length and\r\nbreadth of Eskimo America. The Eskimo, generally speaking, would seem\r\nto have sprung from a Mongol stock; at all events, he can claim no\r\nkinship with the Red Indians. Happily for Europeans, if inferior to\r\nthe latter in physical qualities, he is superior in generosity and\r\namiability of disposition.\r\n\r\nThe Eskimos are sometimes spoken of as if they were dwarfs or\r\nLilliputians, but such is not the case. They are shorter than the\r\naverage Frenchman or Englishman, but individuals measuring from\r\nfive feet ten inches to six feet have been found in Camden Bay. Dr.\r\nKane speaks of Eskimos in Smith Strait who were fully a foot taller\r\nthan himself. It is true of the females, however, that they are\r\ncomparatively little.\r\n\r\nThe Eskimos are a stalwart, broad-shouldered race, considerably\r\nstronger than any other of the races of North America. In both sexes\r\nthe hands and feet are small and well-shaped. Their muscles are\r\nstrongly developed, owing to constant exercise in hunting the seal and\r\nthe walrus. They are also powerful wrestlers, and on no unequal terms\r\ncould compete with the athletic celebrities of Devon and Cornwall.\r\nTheir physiognomy, notwithstanding its lack of beauty, is far from\r\ndispleasing; its expression is cheerful and good-tempered, and the\r\nlong winter night does not seem to sadden their spirits or oppress\r\ntheir energies. The females are well made, and though not handsome,\r\nare scarcely to be stigmatized as ugly. Their teeth are very white and\r\nregular; and their complexion is warm, clear, and good. It is true that\r\nit cannot be seen to advantage, owing to the layers of dirt by which it\r\nis obscured; but it is not much darker than a dark brunette, and as for\r\nthe dirt--well, perhaps, it is preferable to cosmetics!\r\n\r\nEven in the Arctic World, woman seems conscious of the influence of her\r\ncharms, and man seems willing to recognize it. They plait their black\r\nand glossy hair--these Eskimo beauties!--with much care and taste; and\r\nthey tattoo their forehead, cheeks, and chin with a few curved lines,\r\nwhich produce a not altogether unpleasant effect.\r\n\r\nFrom Behring Straits eastward, as far as the river Mackenzie, the\r\nmales pierce the lower lip near each angle of the mouth, in order to\r\nsuspend to it ornaments of blue or green quartz, or of ivory, shaped\r\nlike buttons. Some insert a small ivory quill or dentalium shell in\r\nthe cartilage of the nose. They decorate themselves, moreover, with\r\nstrings of glass beads; or when and where these cannot be obtained,\r\nwith strings of the teeth of the musk-ox, wolf, or fox; hanging them to\r\nthe tail of the jacket, or twining them round the waist like a girdle.\r\n\r\nThe influence of climate upon dress is a subject which we commend\r\nto the notice of art-critics and æsthetic philosophers. Within the\r\nArctic Circle the problem to be solved is, how to obtain the greatest\r\namount of protection for the person, without rendering the costume\r\ntoo heavy or cumbrous; and the Eskimos have succeeded in solving it\r\nsatisfactorily. They can defy the rigour of the Arctic winter, its\r\nextreme cold, its severest gales, and pursue their avocations in the\r\nopen air even in the dreariness of the early winter twilight, so\r\ncleverly adapted is their garb to the conditions under which they live.\r\nTheir boots, made of seal-skin, and lined with the downy skins of\r\nbirds, are thoroughly waterproof; their gloves are large, but defend\r\nthe hands from frost-bite: they wear two pair of breeches, made of\r\nreindeer or seal-skin, of which the under pair has the close, warm,\r\nstimulating hair close to the flesh; and two jackets, of which the\r\nupper one is provided with a large hood, completely enveloping the head\r\nand face, all but the eyes. The women are similarly attired, except\r\nthat their outer jacket is a little longer, and the hood, in which they\r\ncarry their children, considerably larger; and that, in summer, they\r\nsubstitute for the skin-jacket a water-tight shirt, or _kamleika_,\r\nmade of the entrails of the seal or walrus. They sew their boots\r\nso tightly as to render them impervious to moisture, and so neatly\r\nthat they may almost be included in the category of works of art. In\r\nLabrador the women carry their infants in their boots, which have a\r\nlong pointed flap in front for the purpose.\r\n\r\nIn a preceding chapter we have spoken incidentally of the Eskimo\r\nhuts. These, like the Eskimo dress, are admirably adapted to the\r\ncircumstances of the country and the nature of the climate. The\r\nmaterials used are either frozen snow, earth, stones, or drift-wood.\r\nThe snow-hut is a dome-shaped edifice, constructed in the following\r\nmanner:--\r\n\r\nFirst, the builders trace a circle on the smooth level surface of the\r\nsnow, and the snow gathered within the area thus defined is cut into\r\nslabs, and used for building the walls, leaving the ice underneath to\r\nserve as the flooring.\r\n\r\nThe crevices between the slabs, and any accidental fissures, are closed\r\nup by throwing a few shovelfuls of loose snow over the building. Two\r\nmen are generally engaged in the work; and when the dome is completed,\r\nthe one within cuts a low door, through which he creeps. As the walls\r\nare not more than three or four inches thick, they admit a soft subdued\r\nlight into the interior, but a window of transparent ice is generally\r\nadded. Not only the hut, but the furniture inside it, is made of snow;\r\nsnow seats, snow tables, snow couches--the latter rendered comfortable\r\nby coverings of skins. To exclude the cold outer air, the entrance\r\nis protected by an antechamber and a porch; and for the purposes of\r\nintercommunication, covered passages are carried from one hut to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: BUILDING AN ESKIMO HUT.]\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which these snow-huts are raised is quite surprising,\r\nand certainly affords a vivid illustration of the old saying that\r\n“practice brings perfection.” Captain M’Clintock for a few nails hired\r\nfour Eskimos to erect a hut for his ship’s crew; and though it was\r\ntwenty-four feet in circumference, and five and a half feet in height,\r\nit was erected in a single day.\r\n\r\nMuch ingenuity is frequently displayed in their construction.\r\n\r\nDr. Scoresby, in 1824, found some deserted huts on the east coast of\r\nGreenland, which showed no little constructive skill on the part of\r\ntheir builders.\r\n\r\nA horizontal tunnel, about fifteen feet in length, and so low that\r\na person entering it was compelled to crawl on his hands and knees,\r\nopened with one end to the south, while the other end terminated in the\r\ninterior of the hut. This rose but slightly above the surface of the\r\nearth, and being generally overgrown with moss or grass, could scarcely\r\nbe distinguished from the neighbouring soil. It resembled, indeed, a\r\nlarge ant-hill, or the work of a mammoth mole! In some cases the floor\r\nof the tunnel was on a level with that of the hut; but more frequently\r\nit slanted downwards and upwards, so that the colder, and consequently\r\nheavier, atmospheric air was still more completely prevented from\r\nmixing too quickly with the warmer air within. The other arrangements\r\nexhibited the same ingenuity in providing against the inconveniences of\r\na rigorous climate.\r\n\r\nFrom the huts of the Eskimos we pass to their boats.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE ESKIMO KAYAK.]\r\n\r\nThe _kayak_ or _baidar_ is as good in its way as the light\r\nand swift canoe of the Polynesian islanders. It consists of a narrow,\r\nlong, and light wooden framework, covered water-tight with seal-skin,\r\nwith a central aperture for the body of the rower. Sometimes the\r\nframe is made of seal or walrus bone. The Eskimo takes his seat in\r\nhis buoyant craft, with legs outstretched, and binds a sack--which is\r\nmade from the intestines of the whale, or the skins of young seals--so\r\ntightly round his waist, that even in a rolling sea the boat remains\r\nwater-tight. Dexterously and rapidly using his paddle, with his spear\r\nor harpoon before him, and preserving his equilibrium with marvellous\r\nsteadiness, he darts over the waves like an arrow; and even if upset,\r\nspeedily rights himself and his buoyant skiff. The _oomiak_, or\r\nwoman’s boat, consists in like manner of a framework covered with\r\nseal-skins; but it is large enough to accommodate ten or twelve people,\r\nwith benches for the women who row or paddle. The mast supports a\r\ntriangular sail, made of the entrails of seals, and easily distended by\r\nthe wind.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed that a similar degree of inventive and executive\r\nskill is displayed by the Eskimos in their spears and harpoons, their\r\nfishing and hunting implements. Their oars are tastefully inlaid with\r\nwalrus teeth; they have several kinds of spears or darts, according to\r\nthe character of the animal they intend to hunt; and their bows, with\r\nstrings of seal-gut, are so strong and elastic as to drive a six-foot\r\narrow a really considerable distance. The harpoons and spears used\r\nin killing whales or seals have long shafts of wood or bone, and the\r\nbarbed point is so constructed that, when lodged in the body of an\r\nanimal, it remains imbedded, while the shaft attached to it by a string\r\nis loosened from the socket, and acts as a buoy. Seal-skins filled with\r\nair, like bladders, are also employed as buoys for the whale-spears,\r\nbeing stripped from the animal with such address that all the natural\r\napertures are easily made air-tight.\r\n\r\nFish-hooks, knives, and spear or harpoon heads, the Eskimos make of\r\nthe horns and bones of the deer. In constructing their sledges, and\r\nroofing their huts, they have recourse to the ribs of the whale,\r\nwhen drift-wood is not available. Strips of seal-skin hide are a\r\ncapital substitute for cordage, and cords for nets and bow-strings are\r\nmanipulated from the sinews of musk-oxen and deer.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE ESKIMO OOMIAK.]\r\n\r\nA strange and deadly antagonism prevails between the Eskimos and the\r\nRed Indians. On the part of the latter it would seem to originate\r\nin jealousy, for the Eskimos are superior in skill, social habits,\r\ngeneral intelligence, personal courage, and strength; on the part of\r\nthe former, in the necessity for self-defence and the provocations they\r\nhave received from a sanguinary enemy.\r\n\r\nHence, the Indians inhabiting the borders of the Polar World seek every\r\nopportunity of surprising and massacring the inoffensive Eskimos.\r\nHearne relates that, in the course of his expedition to the Coppermine\r\nRiver, the Indians who accompanied him obtained information that a\r\nparty of Eskimos had raised their summer huts near the river-mouth. In\r\nspite of his generous efforts, they resolved on destroying the peaceful\r\nsettlement. Stealthily they made their approach, and when the midnight\r\nsun touched the horizon, they swooped down, with a frightful yell, on\r\ntheir unfortunate victims, not one of whom escaped. With that love of\r\ntorture which seems inherent in the Red Indian, they did their utmost\r\nto intensify and prolong the agonies of the sufferers; and one aged\r\nwoman had both her eyes torn out before she received her death-blow.\r\nThe scene where this cruel slaughter took place is known to this day as\r\nthe “Bloody Falls.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Kane supplies some interesting particulars of a party of Eskimos\r\nwith whom he became acquainted during his memorable expedition. The\r\nintimacy began under unfavourable circumstances, for three of the party\r\nhad been detected in a scandalous theft, had attempted to carry off\r\ntheir plunder, were pursued, overtaken, and punished. Soon afterwards,\r\nMetek, the head man or chief, arrived on the scene, and a treaty of\r\npeace was concluded.\r\n\r\nOn the part of the _Inuit_, or Eskimos, it ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n“We promise that we will not steal. We promise we will bring you fresh\r\nmeat. We promise we will sell or lend you dogs. We will keep you\r\ncompany whenever you want us, and show you where to find the game.”\r\n\r\nOn the part of the _Kablunah_, or white men, it ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n“We promise that we will not visit you with death or sorcery, nor do\r\nyou any hurt or mischief whatsoever. We will shoot for you on our\r\nhunts. You shall be made welcome aboard ship. We will give you presents\r\nof needles, pins, two kinds of knife, a hoop, three bits of hard wood,\r\nsome fat, an awl, and some sewing-thread; and we will trade with you\r\nof these and everything else you want for walrus and seal meat of the\r\nfirst quality.”\r\n\r\nThe treaty, says Dr. Kane, was not solemnized by an oath; but it was\r\nnever broken.\r\n\r\nThe Eskimo settlement at Anatoak, lat. 73° N, on the shore of Smith\r\nStrait, near Cape Inglefield, seems to merit description.\r\n\r\nThe hut or igloë was a single rude elliptical apartment, built not\r\nunskilfully of stone, the outside lined with sods. At its further\r\nend, a rude platform, also of stone, was raised about a foot above\r\nthe entering floor. The roof was irregularly curved. It was composed\r\nof flat stones, remarkably large and heavy, arranged so as to overlap\r\neach other, but apparently without any intelligent application of\r\nthe principle of the arch. The height of this cave-like abode barely\r\npermitted one to sit upright. Its length was eight feet, its breadth\r\nseven feet, and an expansion of the tunnelled entrance made an\r\nappendage of perhaps two feet more.\r\n\r\nThe true winter-entrance is called the _tossut_. It is a walled\r\ntunnel, ten feet long, and so narrow that a man can hardly crawl along\r\nit. It opens outside below the level of the igloë, into which it leads\r\nby a gradual ascent.\r\n\r\nThus the reader will see that the hut at Anatoak was constructed on the\r\nsame principles as the huts discovered by Dr. Scoresby.\r\n\r\nTime had done its work, says Dr. Kane, on the igloë of Anatoak, as\r\namong the palatial structures of more southern deserts. The entire\r\nfront of the dome had fallen in, closing up the _tossut_, or\r\ntunnel, and forcing visitors and residents to enter at the solitary\r\nwindow above it. The breach was wide enough to admit a sledge-team; but\r\nthe Eskimos showed no anxiety to close it up. Their clothes saturated\r\nwith the freezing water of the floes, these men of iron gathered round\r\na fire of hissing and flaring whale’s blubber, and steamed away in\r\napparent comfort. The only departure from their usual routine was\r\nsuggested probably by the open roof and the bleakness of the night;\r\nand therefore they refrained from stripping themselves naked before\r\ncoming into the hut, and hanging up their dripping vestments to dry,\r\nlike a votive offering to the god of the sea.\r\n\r\nTheir kitchen implements were remarkable for simplicity. “A rude\r\nsaucer-shaped cup of seal-skin, to gather and hold water in, was the\r\nsolitary utensil that could be dignified as table-furniture. A flat\r\nstone, a fixture of the hut, supported by other stones just above the\r\nshoulder-blade of a walrus,--the stone slightly inclined, the cavity of\r\nthe bone large enough to hold a moss-wick and some blubber; a square\r\nblock of snow was placed on the stone, and, as the hot smoke circled\r\nround it, the seal-skin saucer caught the water that dripped from\r\nthe edge. They had no vessel for boiling; what they did not eat raw\r\nthey baked upon a hot stone. A solitary coil of walrus-line, fastened\r\nto a movable lance-head (_noon-ghak_), with the well-worn and\r\nwell-soaked clothes on their backs, completed the inventory of their\r\neffects.”\r\n\r\nThe Eskimos entertained Dr. Kane and his companions with a choral\r\nperformance, singing their rude, monotonous song of “Amna Ayah” till\r\nthe unfortunate white men were almost maddened by the discord. They\r\nimprovised, moreover, a special chant in their honour, which they\r\nrepeated with great gravity of utterance, invariably concluding with\r\nthe sonorous and complimentary refrain of “_Nalegak! nalegak!\r\nnalegak-soak!_”--“Captain! captain! great captain!” The chant ran as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Am-na-yah! Am-na-yah! Am-na-yah! Am-na-yah!]\r\n\r\nIn the early spring the Eskimos resume their hunting expeditions, and\r\ntheir snow-covered huts are transformed into scenes of the liveliest\r\nactivity. Stacks of jointed meat, chiefly walrus, are piled upon the\r\nice-foot; the women stretch the hide for sole-leather, and the men\r\ncollect a store of harpoon-lines for the winter. Tusky walrus heads\r\nstare at the spectacle from the snowbank, where they are stowed for\r\ntheir ivory; the dogs are tethered to the ice; and the children, each\r\none armed with the curved rib of some big walrus or seal, play ball and\r\nbat among the snow-drifts.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of walrus meat which the Eskimos accumulate during a\r\nseason of plenty should certainly raise them above all risk of winter\r\nwant; but other causes than improvidence render their supplies scanty.\r\nThey are never idle; they hunt incessantly without the loss of a day.\r\nWhen the storms prevent the use of the sledge, they occupy themselves\r\nin stowing away the spoils of previous hunts. For this purpose they\r\ndig a pit either on the mainland, or, which is preferred, on an island\r\ninaccessible to foxes, and the jointed meat is stacked inside, and\r\ncovered with heavy stones.\r\n\r\nThe true explanation of the scarcity from which these people so\r\nfrequently suffer is the excessive consumption in which they indulge\r\nduring the summer season. By their ancient laws all share in common;\r\nand since they migrate in numbers when their necessities press them,\r\nthe tax on each separate settlement is excessive. The quantity which\r\nthe members of a family consume seems excessive to a stranger; yet\r\nit is not the result of inconsiderate gluttony, but due to their\r\npeculiarities of life and organization. In active exercise, and under\r\nthe influence of exposure to a severe temperature, the waste of carbon\r\nmust be enormous.\r\n\r\nWhen in-doors, and at rest, engaged upon their ivory harness-rings,\r\nfowl-nets, or other household gear, they eat, as many eat in more\r\ncivilized lands, for mere animal enjoyment, and to pass away the time.\r\nBut when engaged in the chase, they take but one meal a day, and that\r\nnot until the day’s labour is ended. They go out upon the ice without\r\nbreakfast, and seldom eat anything until their return. Dr. Kane\r\nestimates the average ration of an Eskimo in a season of plenty at\r\neight to ten pounds of meat a day, with soup and water to the extent\r\nof half a gallon. Such an allowance might almost have satisfied the\r\nappetite of Gargantua!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Hayes, in the course of his adventurous Arctic boat-journey, held\r\nmuch intercourse with the Eskimos, and his impressions, on the whole,\r\nwould seem to have been highly favourable.\r\n\r\nHis sketch of a couple whom he met in the neighbourhood of the Eskimo\r\ncolony of Netlik is very amusing.\r\n\r\nHe describes them as a most _un_human-looking pair. Everything\r\non and about them told of the battle they fought so gallantly and\r\npatiently with the elements. From head to foot they were invested in\r\na coat of ice and snow. Shapeless lumps of whiteness, they resembled\r\nthe snow-kings or statues which boys delight in making, except that\r\nthey possessed the faculty of motion. Their long, heavy fox-skin coats,\r\nreaching nearly to the knees, and surmounted by a hood, covering, like\r\na round lump, all of the head but the face, the bear-skin pantaloons\r\nand boots and mittens were saturated with snow. Their long, black hair,\r\nwhich fell from beneath their hoods over their eyes and cheeks, their\r\neyelashes, the few hairs growing upon their chins, the rim of fur\r\naround their faces, all glittered with white frost--the frozen moisture\r\nof their breath. Each carried in his right hand a whip, and in his left\r\na lump of frozen meat and blubber. The meat they flung down on the\r\nfloor of Dr. Hayes’ hut; then, without pausing for an invitation, they\r\nthrust their whipstocks under the rafters, and divesting themselves of\r\ntheir mittens and outer garments, hung them thereon. Underneath their\r\nfrosty coats they wore a warm, close shirt of bird-skins.\r\n\r\nIn the same bold explorer’s narrative of his voyage of discovery in\r\n1860, two other Eskimos figure very conspicuously; and one of these,\r\nnamed Hans, would seem to have been a very fair type of the Eskimo\r\ncharacter. Hans, we may observe, had originally served in Dr. Kane’s\r\nexpedition, and had then gained the confidence of Dr. Hayes; so that\r\nwhen the latter undertook his own memorable voyage, he became anxious\r\nto secure the Eskimo’s services.\r\n\r\nWhen his ship had crossed Melville Bay, and lay in the grim shadows\r\nof Cape York, Dr. Hayes bethought himself of the Eskimo hunter. He\r\nremembered to have heard that Hans had fallen in love, and taken a\r\nwife, and repaired, with her at his side, to share the fortunes of the\r\nwild Eskimos who inhabit the remote northern shores of Baffin Bay.\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Hayes felt confident that the hunter, having known something of\r\nthe superior comfort and happiness of the social life of civilization,\r\nwould soon weary of his voluntary banishment, and of the penury and\r\nhardships of the existence of the Eskimo nomads. He made up his mind\r\nthat Hans would return to Cape York, and there take up his residence,\r\nin the hope of being picked up by some passing ship.\r\n\r\nSo Dr. Hayes stood close in-shore, to find that his conjectures were\r\ncompletely realized. As he sailed along the coast he discovered a group\r\nof human beings eagerly endeavouring by signs and gestures to attract\r\nattention. Heaving the schooner to, he and his second in command,\r\nMr. Sountag, went ashore in a boat, and there was Hans! The Eskimo\r\nrecognized both of them immediately, and called them by name.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DR. HAYES FALLS IN WITH HANS THE HUNTER.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe may adopt the remainder of Dr. Hayes’ interesting little\r\nepisode, because it illustrates the ingrained selfishness, or\r\nself-concentration, of the Eskimo character.\r\n\r\nHans had deteriorated greatly during his residence with the wild\r\nEskimos, and he had sunk to their level of filthy ugliness. He was\r\naccompanied by his wife, who carried her first-born in a hood upon her\r\nback; his wife’s brother, a quick-eyed boy of twelve years; and his\r\nwife’s mother, “an ancient dame with voluble and flippant tongue.”\r\nThey were all attired in the usual Eskimo dress of skins; objects of\r\ninterest and curiosity, but not “things of beauty.”\r\n\r\nHans led his visitors, over rough rocks and through deep drifts\r\nof snow, to his rude hut, which stood on the cold hill-top, about\r\ntwo hundred feet above the sea-level. An excellent position for a\r\n“look-out,” but as inconvenient for a hunter as can well be imagined.\r\nHere he had watched and waited for many a dreary month; surveying the\r\nsea day after day, in the faint hope of discovering some European\r\nvessel. But none came; summer passed into winter, and winter lengthened\r\ninto summer; and still Hans watched and waited, yearning after his\r\nsouthern home and the friends of his youth.\r\n\r\nHis tent--for it was rather a tent than a hut--was made of seal-skins,\r\nand its capacity was scarcely sufficient to accommodate his little\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nDr. Hayes asked him if he would accompany the expedition.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nWould he take his wife and baby?\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nWould he go without them?\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nThis last answer reveals the curious unimpressionableness of the\r\nEskimo, who endures with calmness, nay, even with indifference, those\r\npartings which try the heartstrings of the European. It is, perhaps, a\r\nresult of the constant warfare he maintains against an uncongenial and\r\naustere Nature that he comes to regard himself as his first and chief,\r\nas almost his only concern. So long as his wife and children surround\r\nhim, he shows no evident want of affection; but he has no objection to\r\npart from them, if the separation will prove to his individual interest.\r\n\r\nAs Dr. Hayes had no leisure to examine critically into the state of his\r\nmind, and as he cherished a conviction that the permanent separation of\r\nhusband and wife was to be regarded as a painful event, he determined\r\non giving the Eskimo mother the benefit of this conventional suspicion.\r\nBoth husband and wife, therefore, were carried on board the schooner,\r\nas well as their baby, their tent, and all their household goods. The\r\nbright-eyed boy and the ancient dame cried to accompany them; but\r\nDr. Hayes had no further room, and was compelled to leave them to\r\nthe care of their tribe, who, about twenty in number, had discovered\r\nthe schooner, and with a merry shout had come across the hill. After\r\nbestowing upon them some useful gifts, Dr. Hayes returned to his vessel.\r\n\r\nHe adds that Hans was the only unconcerned person in the party. At a\r\nlater period the thought crossed his commander’s mind that he would\r\nby no means have been displeased had wife and child been left to the\r\ncharity of their savage kin: while Dr. Hayes had abundant reason,\r\nduring the course of the expedition, to wish that he had left the\r\nselfish and indolent Eskimo to linger in his seal-skin tent among the\r\nhills and rocks of Cape York.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe same traveller describes the hunting equipment of a party of\r\nEskimos setting out in pursuit of bears.\r\n\r\nFirst, the dogs. These were picketed, each team separately, on a\r\nconvenient area of level ground; and on the approach of Dr. Hayes and\r\nhis companions they sprang up from the knotted heap, in which they\r\nhad been lying through the night, with a wild, fierce yell, which\r\ndied away into a low whine and impatient snarl. They evidently were\r\nhungry, and their masters seemed desirous of feeding them; for, going\r\nto their sledges, each one brought up a flat piece of something which\r\nlooked singularly like plate-iron, but, upon examination, was found to\r\nbe walrus-hide, three-quarters of an inch thick, and frozen intensely\r\nhard. Throwing it upon the snow a few feet in advance of their\r\nrespective teams, they drew their knives from their capacious boots,\r\nand attempted to cut up the skin; but its hardness defied all their\r\nefforts, and Dr. Hayes had to fetch hatchet and saw before the work of\r\ndivision could be completed.\r\n\r\nDuring the few minutes thus occupied, the dogs had become almost\r\nfrantic. They endeavoured to break loose; pulling on their traces,\r\nrunning back and springing forward, straining and choking themselves\r\nuntil their eyes shot fire, and the foam flew from their mouths. The\r\nsight of food had stimulated their wolfish passions, and they seemed\r\nready to eat each other. Not a moment passed that two or more of them\r\nwere not flying at each other’s throats, and, grappling together,\r\nrolled, and tossed, and tumbled over the snow.\r\n\r\nThe Eskimos looked on apparently unconcerned, except when there\r\nappeared a risk of one of the dogs being injured, and then they secured\r\na temporary calm by uttering an angry nasal “Ay! Ay!”\r\n\r\nWhen at length the food was thrown, the dogs uttered a greedy scream,\r\nwhich was followed by a moment’s silence while the pieces were falling,\r\nthen by a scuffle, and the hard, frozen chunks had vanished. How they\r\nwere swallowed, or how they were digested, was, to the spectator,\r\ninexplicable! Enough to say that “the jaws of darkness did devour them\r\nup,” and calm instantaneously succeeded to the storm.\r\n\r\nThe Eskimo dog is of medium size, and squarely built; in fact, he is\r\na reclaimed wolf, and exhibits that variety of colour which, after a\r\nfew generations, generally characterizes tame animals. Gray, which is\r\noften seen, was probably at one time the predominating colour. Some of\r\nthe dogs are black, with white breasts; some are wholly white; others\r\nare reddish or yellowish; but, indeed, almost every shade may be seen\r\namongst them. Their skin is covered with a coarse, compact fur, and is\r\nmuch valued by the natives for the purposes of clothing. In the form\r\nof the animals the variety is considerable; but the general characters\r\nwould seem to be a pointed nose, short ears, a cowardly, treacherous\r\neye, and a hanging tail. But exceptions occasionally occur, and one\r\nfigures in Dr. Hayes’ narrative under the name of _Toodlamik_, or,\r\nmore briefly, _Toodla_.\r\n\r\nHe differed from his kind in having a more compact head, a less\r\npointed nose, an eye denoting affection and reliance, and an erect,\r\nbold, fearless carriage. Dr. Hayes, however, expresses some doubt\r\nas to his purity of blood. From the beginning to the end of the\r\ncruise he was master of all the dogs that were brought to the ship.\r\nIn this connection it is worthy of remark, that in every pack one\r\ndog invariably attains the mastership of the whole--a kind of\r\nmajor-generalship; and in each team, one who is master of his\r\ncomrades, a general of brigade. Once master, always master; but the\r\npost of honour is gained at the cost of many a lame leg and ghastly\r\nwound, and is held only by doing daily battle against all comers. These\r\ncould easily gain the ascendancy in every case, but for their own petty\r\njealousies, which often prevent their union for such a purpose. If a\r\ncombination, however, does happen to be brought about, and the leader\r\nis hopelessly beaten, he is never worth anything afterward; his spirit\r\nis completely prostrated, the poor fellow pines away, and dies at last\r\nof a broken heart.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ESKIMO DOGS.]\r\n\r\nToodla, says Dr. Hayes, was a character in his way. He was a tyrant\r\nof no mean pretension. Apparently he thought it his special duty to\r\nattack every dog, great or small, that was added to the pack: if the\r\nanimal was a large one, in order, probably, that he might at once be\r\nforced to feel that he had a master; if a small one, in order that\r\nthe others might hold him in the greater awe. It was sometimes quite\r\namusing to see him set off in pursuit of a strange dog, his head erect,\r\nhis tail curled gracefully over his back; slowly and deliberately he\r\nwent straight at his mark, with the confident, defiant air of one\r\nwho recognizes the power and importance of his office. Leagues and\r\nconspiracies were not unfrequently formed against him, induced, no\r\ndoubt, by a feeling of despair; but he always succeeded in overthrowing\r\nthem,--not, it is true, without occasional assistance from “without;”\r\nfor the sailors, who petted him greatly, would sometimes take his part\r\nwhen the struggle was manifestly unequal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut we must leave the dogs, and turn to the sledge.\r\n\r\nThis was, in very truth, an ingenious specimen of native mechanical\r\nskill. It was made wholly of bone and leather. The runners, which were\r\nsquare behind and rounded upward in front, and about five feet long,\r\nseven inches high, and three-fourths of an inch thick, were slabs of\r\nbone; not solid, but made up of a number of pieces of various shapes\r\nand sizes, dexterously fitted and tightly lashed together. Some of\r\nthese were not larger than one’s two fingers; some were three or four\r\ninches square; others were as large as one’s hand, and triangular in\r\nshape; others, again, were several inches in length, and two or three\r\nin breadth. They all fitted into their several places as exactly as\r\nthe blocks of a Chinese puzzle. Near their margins ran rows of little\r\nholes, and through these strings of seal-skin were inserted, by which\r\nthe blocks were fastened together, until the whole was as firm as a\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nThe marvel of the thing is that all these pieces are flattened and cut\r\ninto the required shape, not with nicely contrived instruments and\r\ntools, but with stones. The labour must be immense. The grinding needed\r\nto make a single runner must be the work of months. The construction\r\nof an entirely new sledge would probably occupy the lifetime of a\r\ngeneration; and hence a vehicle of this kind becomes a family heirloom,\r\nand is handed down from father to son, and son to grandson, and is\r\nconstantly undergoing repair and restoration; a new piece here, another\r\nthere, until as little remains of the original structure as of the\r\nsailor’s old knife, when it had had a new blade and a new handle! The\r\norigin of some of the Eskimo sledges is lost in the mists of a remote\r\nantiquity.\r\n\r\nThe runners are usually shod with ivory from the tusk of the walrus.\r\nThe said ivory had likewise been ground flat, and its corners made\r\nsquare, with stones; and it was fastened to the runner by a string\r\nlooped through two counter-sunk holes. The pieces of which it was\r\ncomposed were numerous; but the surface was wonderfully uniform, and as\r\nsmooth as glass.\r\n\r\nThe runners stood about fourteen inches apart, and were fastened\r\ntogether by bones, tightly lashed to them; the bones used being the\r\nfemur of the bear, the antlers of the reindeer, and the ribs of the\r\nnarwhal. Two walrus-ribs, lashed one to the after-end of each runner,\r\nserved as upstanders, and were braced by a piece of reindeer antler,\r\nsecured across the top.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving thus disposed of the team and the sledge, we now come to the\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\nFirst, one of the Eskimo hunters spread a piece of seal-skin over the\r\nsledge, fastening it securely by little strings attached to its margin.\r\nOn this he placed a small piece of walrus-skin, as a provision for\r\nthe dogs; a piece of blubber for fuel; and of meat for his own lunch.\r\nDuring his absence he would cook no food, but he would want water; and\r\ntherefore he carried his _kotluk_, or lamp--namely, a small stone\r\ndish; a lump of _mannek_ or dried moss, designed for the wick;\r\nand some willow-blossoms (_na-owinals_) for tinder. To ignite the\r\ntinder, he had a piece of iron-stone and a small sharp fragment of\r\nflint.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ESKIMO SLEDGE AND TEAM.]\r\n\r\nWe may follow him on his route, and ascertain the use he makes of these\r\nappliances. When he grows thirsty, he halts; scrapes away the snow\r\nuntil he lays bare the solid ice beneath; and painfully scoops in it\r\na small cavity. Next, he fetches a block of fresh-water ice from a\r\nneighbouring berg, lights his lamp, and, using the blubber for fuel,\r\nproceeds to place the block on the edge of the cavity. As it slowly\r\nthaws, the water trickles down into the hole; and when the Eskimo\r\nthinks the quantity collected is sufficient to quench his thirst, he\r\nremoves the rude apparatus, and, stooping down, drinks the soot-stained\r\nfluid. If he feels hungry, he breaks off a few chips from his lump of\r\nfrozen walrus-beef, cuts a few slices from the blubber, and enjoys his\r\nunsatisfactory meal. The inhabitant of the Arctic desert knows nothing\r\nof epicurean tastes; and if he did, he has no means of gratifying them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo return to the equipment. The hunter carried with him an extra pair\r\nof boots, another of dog-skin stockings, and another of mittens, to be\r\nused in case he should be unfortunate enough to get on thin ice, and\r\nthe ice should break through.\r\n\r\nThe entire equipment being placed upon the sledge, he threw over them a\r\npiece of bear-skin, which was doubled, so that, when opened, it would\r\nbe large enough to wrap about his body and protect it from the snow,\r\nif he wished to lie down and rest. Then he drew forth a long line,\r\nfastened an end of it through a hole in the fore part of one of the\r\nrunners, ran it across diagonally to the opposite runner, passed it\r\nthrough a hole there, and so continued, to and fro, from side to side,\r\nuntil he reached the other end of the sledge. There he made fast the\r\nline, and thus the cargo was secured against all risk of loss from an\r\nupset. Next he hung to one upstander a coil of heavy line, and to the\r\nother a lighter coil, tying them fast with a small string. The former\r\nwas his harpoon-line for catching walrus; the latter, for catching\r\nseal. His harpoon staff was made from the tusk of the narwhal; measured\r\nfive feet in length, and two inches in diameter at one end, tapering to\r\na point at the other.\r\n\r\nAll being ready, the team, consisting of seven dogs, was brought up.\r\nThe harness was of a very primitive description. It consisted of two\r\ndoubled strips of bear-skin, one of which was placed on either side\r\nof the animal’s body, the two being fastened together on the top of\r\nthe neck and at the breast, so as to form a collar. Thence they passed\r\ninside of the dog’s fore legs and up along his flanks to the tail,\r\nwhere the four ends meeting together were attached to a trace eighteen\r\nfeet in length.\r\n\r\nThe trace was connected with the sledge by a line four feet long, of\r\nwhich one end was attached to each runner. And to the middle of the\r\nline a stout string was fastened, running-through bone rings at the\r\nends of the traces, and secured by a slip-knot, easily untied--an\r\narrangement designed with the view of ensuring safety in bear-hunting.\r\nThe bear is hotly pursued until the sledge arrives within about fifty\r\nyards; the hunter then leans forward and slips the knot; the dogs, set\r\nloose from the sledge, quickly bring the brute to bay. If the knot gets\r\nfouled, serious accidents are not unlikely to occur. The hunter vainly\r\nendeavours to extricate it, and before he can draw his knife to cut\r\nit--supposing he is fortunate enough to have such an instrument--man,\r\nand dogs, and sledge are all among the bear’s legs, in a huddled and\r\ntangled heap, and at the mercy of the enraged monster.\r\n\r\nThe dogs were cold, and eager to start. In a moment they were yoked\r\nto the sledge; the hunter with his right hand threw out the coils\r\nof his long whip-lash, with his left he seized an upstander, and\r\npropelling the sledge a few paces, he uttered at the same moment the\r\nshrill starting-cry, “Ka! ka!--ka! ka!” which sent the dogs in a\r\nbound to their places, and away they dashed over the rugged ice. The\r\nhunter skilfully guided his sledge among the hummocks, moderating the\r\nimpetuosity of his team with the nasal “Ay! ay!” which they perfectly\r\nunderstand. On reaching the smooth ice, he dropped upon the sledge,\r\nallowed his whip-lash to trail after him on the snow, shouted “Ka!\r\nka!--ka! ka!” to his savage team, and disappeared in as wild a gallop\r\nas ever was taken by the demon huntsman of German legend!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that the Eskimos have magistrates or laws, yet the\r\nutmost good order prevails in their communities, and quarrels are\r\nrare. When these do occur, one or other of the dissatisfied parties\r\ncollects his little store, and migrates to a different settlement. The\r\nconstitution of their society is rightly described as patriarchal, but\r\nthe ruler does not seem to be elected: he attains his post by proving\r\nhis possession of superior strength, address, and courage. As soon\r\nas his physical powers give way, or old age enfeebles his mind, he\r\ndeposes himself, takes his seat in the _oomiak_, or woman’s boat,\r\nand is relegated by common consent to female companionship. Like all\r\nsavage tribes, the Eskimos have their mystery-men, or _angekoks_,\r\nwho resort to the usual deceptions to acquire and retain supremacy,\r\nswallowing knives, resorting to ventriloquial artifices, and conversing\r\nin a mysterious jargon, unintelligible to “the common herd.” They\r\nprofess to hold intercourse with certain potent spirits, and to\r\nemploy their agency in rewarding or punishing their dupes; and even\r\nthe influence of the Christian missionaries has hardly rooted out the\r\nbelief in the superstitions originated and fostered by these men.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the hard conditions of their life, and the dreariness\r\nof the region which they inhabit, the Eskimos are a cheerful people.\r\nThey are keenly sensible of the charms of music, though their own\r\nvocalization is inconceivably melancholy; and they are partial to many\r\nrude pastimes, mostly of a gymnastic character.\r\n\r\nTheir good nature has been praised by many travellers; but they show\r\nthe usual inhumanity of the savage towards the aged and infirm.\r\nWeakness is no title to the sympathy of the Eskimo; he respects\r\nstrength, but he utterly disregards and cruelly oppresses the feeble.\r\nHe is ungrateful towards his benefactors, and in his intercourse with\r\nstrangers his fidelity can be relied upon only so long as he knows that\r\nany breach of faith will be severely punished. He does not steal from\r\nhis own people, and “Tiglikpok,” “he is a thief,” is a reproach among\r\nthe Eskimos as among ourselves; but no shame attaches to him if he robs\r\nthe white man, though the latter may have loaded him with favours.\r\n\r\nIf we add that they display a strong affection for their children, and\r\nthat the children are singularly docile and obedient to their parents,\r\nwe shall have said enough to assist the reader in forming an accurate\r\nconception of the characteristics of the inhabitants of the Eskimo\r\nLand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n                        LAPLAND AND THE LAPPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLapland, or the Land of the Lapps, which the Lapps themselves call\r\nSameanda or Somellada, forms the north and north-eastern portions of\r\nthe Scandinavian peninsula, and is divided between Sweden and Russia.\r\nNorwegian Lapland includes the provinces of Norrland and Finmark;\r\nSwedish, of North and South Bothnia; and Russian, of Kola and Kemi.\r\nThe last-named has an area of 11,300 square miles, with a population\r\nof 9000; Swedish Lapland, an area of 50,600 square miles, with 4000\r\ninhabitants; and Norwegian, an area of 26,500 square miles, with a\r\npopulation of 5000. We are here referring to the number of true Lapps;\r\nin each division the population would be largely increased if we\r\nincluded Finns, Russians, Swedes, Norwegians.\r\n\r\nLapland, for nine months in the year, is blighted by the rigour of\r\na winter climate. The summer months, when the sun does not set for\r\nseveral weeks, are July and August; and these are preceded by a brief\r\nspring, and followed by even a briefer autumn. Cereals do not thrive\r\nhigher than the sixty-sixth parallel, with the exception of barley,\r\nwhich is cultivated as far north as the seventieth. The greater part\r\nof the country comes within that wooded zone which we described in an\r\nearlier chapter, and the forests, consisting of birch, pine, fir, and\r\nalder, spread over a very extensive area. On the mosses and lichens\r\nwhich grow abundantly in their shelter, are fed the immense herds of\r\nreindeer which constitute the principal wealth of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe Lapps may almost be regarded as a nation of Lilliputians. Their men\r\nseldom exceed five feet in height, while the majority are some inches\r\nbelow that very moderate stature; and the women are even shorter. They\r\nare, however, a robust race, with muscular limbs, and unusual girth\r\nof body, the circumference of their chest being nearly equal to their\r\nheight. Their complexion is dark, tawny, or copper-coloured; their\r\ndark, piercing, deep-sunken eyes are set very wide apart, so as to\r\ncommunicate a peculiar character to the physiognomy. The wild, strange\r\neffect is further increased by the unkempt masses of dark, lank,\r\nstraight hair which droop on either side of the whiskerless, beardless\r\nface. The cheek-bones are prominent, like those of a Celtic Highlander;\r\nthe nose is flat; the mouth wide, with thin compressed lips. It may\r\nbe supposed that the Lapps, from these indications, are not models of\r\nmasculine or feminine beauty; and Dr. Clarke asserts that, when aged,\r\nmany of them, if exposed in a menagerie, might be mistaken for the\r\nlong-lost transitional form intermediate between man and ape. And,\r\ncertainly, there is something repulsive in the constant blinking of\r\neyes rendered sore by the pungent smoke of their huts, or the white\r\nglare of the snow, as well as in the expression of obstinacy and low\r\ncunning which one reads in every feature.\r\n\r\nAn aristocrat might be proud of their small and finely-shaped hands;\r\nbut their arms, like their legs, are disproportionately short, clumsy,\r\nand thick. Clumsy, we mean, in shape; certainly not in movement, for\r\nthe extraordinary flexibility of their limbs is one of the traits by\r\nwhich a Lapp is easily distinguished.\r\n\r\nOf the dress of the Lapps it is needless to say much. In winter it\r\nconsists of bears’ skins, in which both male and female wrap themselves\r\nup, with the fur outward. In summer the men wear a sort of tunic, the\r\n_poesk_, made of coarse light-coloured woollen cloth, depending\r\nto the knee, but bound about the waist with a belt or girdle. Their\r\nhead-gear consists of a kind of fez, made of wool, and adorned with a\r\nred worsted band round the rim, and a bright red tassel. Their boots\r\nor shoes are cut from the raw skin of the reindeer, with the hair\r\noutwards, and they are peaked in shape. They are thin, and they have\r\nno lining; but the Lapp defends his feet and ankles from the cold by\r\nstuffing the vacant space of the boot with the broad leaves of the\r\n_Carex vesicaria_, or Cyperus grass, which he cuts in summer, rubs\r\nin his hands, and dries before using. The female costume resembles that\r\nof the males, but their girdles are gayer with rings and chains.\r\n\r\nThe Lapps are a superstitious race. Like all the Norse tribes, they\r\nbelieve in witchcraft; and of old the Lapland witches had a reputation\r\nwhich extended to England, for being able to ward off rain or disperse\r\nstorms. The English seamen trading to Archangel frequently visited\r\ntheir coast in order to buy a favourable wind.\r\n\r\nMany of the Lapps claim the ability to foretell future events, and\r\nfall, or pretend to fall, into a trance or ecstasy, during which they\r\nsee visions, utter prophecies, and unlock the secrets of those who\r\ntrust to their divination. They also read the fortunes of inquiring\r\ndupes by means of a cup of liquor, or by the vulgarest jargon of\r\npalmistry. Superstition is the daughter of Ignorance. It is also the\r\nsister of Fear, for the superstitious are invariably prone to see\r\nsupernatural signs and wonders in the appearances of the heavens, or to\r\nhear unearthly voices borne upon the midnight wind, and in everything\r\nthey cannot understand to imagine the presence of some antagonistic\r\npower. As the American natives were panic-stricken at the occurrence of\r\nan eclipse, so the Lapps are filled with dread when the sky glows with\r\nthe coruscations of the aurora.\r\n\r\nThese superstitions prevail in spite of the exertions of priests and\r\nschoolmasters. They are nourished in secret even when they are not\r\nopenly proclaimed; and the Lapp, after listening devoutly to the\r\nharangue of his pastor, will return home to offer homage to his saidas,\r\nor wooden idols; to cower at the name of Trolls, the evil spirit of the\r\nforest; and to be deluded by the artifices of any so-called witch or\r\nfortune-teller.\r\n\r\nThere are Lapps, and Lapps; each, according to the region he inhabits,\r\nbearing his distinctive characteristics, and preserving his individual\r\nhabits. Thus, there are the Fjälllappars, or Mountain Lapps; the\r\nSkogslappars, or Wood Lapps; and the Fisherlapps.\r\n\r\nFrom the nature of the country the reader will expect, and will be\r\nright in expecting, that the Fjälllappars form the most numerous\r\nsection. They are the nomads of Lapland, and their mode of life is\r\nentirely pastoral. As the Arabs with their flocks move from one oasis\r\nto another, or the Tartars with their cattle, so the Lapps migrate from\r\nplace to place, compelled by the necessity of finding sustenance for\r\ntheir herds of reindeer. The mosses and lichens on which these animals\r\nfeed are soon exhausted, and some time elapses before the half-frozen\r\nsoil replaces them. The same cause operates to prevent the Lapps from\r\nassembling in large communities. Seldom more than three, four, or five\r\nfamilies encamp in the same neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nIt will not be supposed that the temporary abode of a nomad exhibits\r\nany architectural completeness. Their _tuguria_, or huts, are of\r\nthe rudest construction. They raise a conical framework, composed of\r\nthe flexible stems of trees, and this they cover with a coarse kind of\r\ncanvas, and in winter with the skins of reindeer and other animals. No\r\ndoorway is required, and egress and ingress are provided for by turning\r\nup a portion of the canvas at the bottom, so as to form a triangular\r\ngap; and the portion so turned up is let down again at night. In the\r\ncentre of the interior some large stones are piled together for a\r\nfireplace, and a square opening in the roof above carries off the\r\nsmoke, and lets in the light and air--not to say rain, snow, and fog,\r\nwhen these prevail.\r\n\r\nThe tent or hut we have described generally measures about six feet in\r\ndiameter, and eighteen to twenty in circumference. It does not exceed\r\nten feet in height. There is no floor, but the ground is covered with\r\nreindeer skins, and upon these the inhabitants sit or crouch by day,\r\nand huddle themselves up at night. The household utensils, implements,\r\nand weapons are suspended from the sides of the hut; and the clothing\r\nof the family, no very extensive stock, is preserved in a chest.\r\n\r\nOn a shelf or platform, raised high above the reach of dogs and wolves,\r\nbetween two neighbouring trees, the Lapp keeps his store of dried\r\nreindeer flesh, and cheese, and curds; for his diet is as plain as his\r\ngeneral habit of living. His herd of reindeer he puts up at night, or\r\nwhen they are required for milking, in a large enclosure, about four\r\nhundred to five hundred feet in circuit, formed by a barrier of posts\r\nand stumps of trees, supporting a row of horizontal poles. Against the\r\nlatter birch poles and branches of trees are placed diagonally, forming\r\na kind of abattis, which is found to be a sufficient security against\r\nthe attacks of wolves.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the milking of a herd of reindeer affords a lively and\r\npicturesque spectacle. When they have been driven within the area, and\r\nall the outlets closed, a Lapp, selecting a long cord or thong, twists\r\nboth ends round his left hand, and then in his right gathers the thong\r\nitself in loose coils. Fixing on a reindeer, he flings the coils over\r\nits antlers. Sometimes the latter offers no resistance; but generally,\r\non feeling the touch of the thong, it darts away, and its pursuer, in\r\norder to secure it, is called upon for the most vigorous efforts. And\r\nthe scene is animated indeed, when half-a-dozen reindeer, pursued by as\r\nmany Lapps, sweep round and round the enclosure, until the former are\r\nfinally overcome, or, as now and then happens, wrest the cord from the\r\nhands of the discomfited Lapp, and leave him prostrate on the ground.\r\nWhen the animal is secured, his master takes a dexterous hitch of the\r\nthong round his muzzle and head, and then fastens him to the trunk of a\r\nprostrate tree. The operation of milking is performed by both men and\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the pasture in the neighbourhood is exhausted, the\r\nencampment is broken up, and the little company migrate to some fresh\r\nstation. The rude tuguria are dismantled in less than half an hour, and\r\npacked with all the household furniture on the backs of the reindeer,\r\nwho, by long training, are inured to serve as beasts of burden. On\r\nthe journey they are bound together, five and five, with leather\r\nthongs, and led by the women over the mountains; while the father of\r\nthe family precedes the march to select a suitable site for the new\r\nencampment, and his sons or servants follow with the remainder of the\r\nherd.\r\n\r\nAs spring verges upon summer, the Lapps abandon their mountain\r\npastures, and move towards the shore. No sooner do the reindeer\r\nscent the keen sea-air than, breaking loose from all control, they\r\ndash headlong into the briny waves of the fiord, and drink long\r\ndraughts of the salt sea-water. The Lapps consider this sea-side\r\nmigration essential to the health of their herds. When summer reaches\r\nits meridian, and the snow melts, they return to the pleasant\r\nmountain-solitudes, ascending higher and higher, according to the\r\nincrease of temperature. Then, on the approach of winter, they retire\r\ninto the woods, where their great difficulty is to defend their herds\r\nand themselves from the attacks of the wolves. In this incessant\r\nwarfare they derive much assistance from the courage of their dogs.\r\nThese are about the size of a Scotch terrier, with long shaggy hair,\r\nand a head bearing a curiously close resemblance to that of a lynx.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: REINDEER IN LAPLAND.]\r\n\r\nIn the winter the Lapp accomplishes his journeys either by sledging or\r\nskating.\r\n\r\nTheir skates are not exactly things of beauty, but they answer their\r\npurpose admirably. One is as long as the person who wears it; the other\r\nis about a foot shorter. The feet of the wearer are placed in the\r\nmiddle, and the skates, or _skidas_, fastened to them by thongs\r\nor withes. They are made of fir-wood, and covered with the skins of\r\nreindeer, which check any backward movement by acting like bristles\r\nagainst the snow. It is astonishing with what speed the Lapp, thus\r\nequipped, can traverse the frozen ground. The most dexterous skater on\r\nthe canals of Holland could not outstrip him. He runs down the swiftest\r\nwild beasts; and the exercise so stimulates and warms his frame that,\r\neven in mid-winter, when pursuing one of these lightning-like courses,\r\nhe can dispense with his garment of furs. When he wishes to stop, he\r\nmakes use of a long pole, which is provided with a round ball of wood\r\nnear the end, to prevent it from sinking too deep into the snow.\r\n\r\nHe is no less expert as a sledger. His vehicle, or _pulka_, is\r\nfashioned like a boat, with a convex bottom, so as to slip over the\r\nsnow with all the greater ease; the prow is sharp and pointed, but\r\nthe hind part flat. Perhaps it may better be compared to a punt than\r\na boat. At all events, in this curious vehicle the Lapp is bound and\r\nswathed, like an infant in its cradle. To preserve its equilibrium, he\r\ntrusts to the dexterity with which he moves his body to and fro, and\r\nfrom side to side, as may be needed; and he guides it by means of a\r\nstout pole. His steed, a reindeer, is fastened to it by traces attached\r\nto its collar, and connected with the fore part of the sledge; the\r\nreins are twisted round its horns; and all about its trappings are hung\r\na number of little bells, in the tintinnabulation of which the animal\r\ngreatly delights. Thus accoutred, it will perform a journey of fifty or\r\nsixty miles a day; sometimes travelling fifty miles without pause, and\r\nwith no other refreshment than an occasional mouthful of snow.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: TRAVELLING IN LAPLAND.]\r\n\r\nWith wonderful accuracy the Lapp will guide himself and his steed\r\nthrough a seemingly labyrinthine wilderness, when the usual signs and\r\ncharacters of the landscape are buried deep in snow. But his memory is\r\ntenacious, and a blighted tree, or a projecting crag, or a clump of\r\nfirs, affords him a sufficient indication of the correctness of his\r\ncourse. He frequently continues his rapid journey throughout the night,\r\nwhen the moon invests the gleaming plains with a strange brilliancy,\r\nor the aurora fills both earth and heaven with the reflection of its\r\nwondrous fires.\r\n\r\nA French traveller, M. de Saint-Blaize, is of opinion that the Lapps,\r\nlike all savage and semi-civilized races, are rapidly diminishing in\r\nnumbers. Yet this diminution is hardly owing to the conditions under\r\nwhich they live. Their life, to the civilized European, seems severe\r\nand almost intolerable; but though it is marked by privation and\r\nfatigue, it is not without its charms. It is free and independent, and\r\nwithout anxiety. As for the privation and fatigue, the Lapp is hardly\r\nconscious of them, because his capacity of endurance is great, and he\r\nis accustomed to them from his earliest years. Temperate, active, and\r\ninured to exertion, his physical frame is wonderfully vigorous, and he\r\nknows nothing of the majority of maladies which afflict the dweller in\r\ncities. One terrible disease, indeed, he does not escape, and this may\r\nhave had much to do with their decline,--the smallpox. Otherwise, they\r\nare a healthy as well as a hardy race. If during a journey a Lapp woman\r\ngives birth to a child, she places the new-born in a frame of hollow\r\nwood, in which a hole has been cut to receive the little one’s head;\r\nthen slings this rude cradle on her back, and continues her march.\r\nWhen she halts, she suspends the infant and its cradle to a tree, the\r\nwirework with which it is covered affording a sufficient protection\r\nagainst wild beasts.\r\n\r\nProfessor Forbes, however, describes a more comfortable cradle, which\r\nis cut out of solid wood, and covered with leather, in flaps so\r\narranged as to lace across the top with leathern thongs; the inside\r\nis lined with reindeer moss, and a pillow, also of reindeer moss, is\r\nprovided for the head of the infant, who fits the space so exactly that\r\nit can stir neither hand nor foot.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Lapp is a bold hunter, and will encounter the bear single-handed.\r\nLike the Siberian, he entertains a superstitious reverence for this\r\npowerful animal, which he regards as the wisest and most acute of all\r\nthe beasts of the field, and supposes to know and hear all that is said\r\nabout it; but as its fur is valuable and its flesh well-favoured, he\r\ndoes not refrain from pursuing it to the death, though careful, so to\r\nspeak, to kill it with the highest respect.\r\n\r\nEarly in winter the bear retires to a rocky cave, or a covert of\r\nbranches, leaves, and moss, and there remains, without food, and in a\r\nstate of torpidity, until the spring recalls him to active life. After\r\nthe first snow-fall, the Lapp hunters seek the forest, and search for\r\ntraces of their enemy. These being found, the spot is carefully marked,\r\nand after a few weeks they return, arouse the slumbering brute, and\r\nstimulate it to an attack; for to shoot it while asleep, or, indeed, to\r\nuse any weapon but a lance, is considered dishonourable.\r\n\r\nHogguer, whose narrative is quoted by Hartwig, accompanied a couple of\r\nLapps, well armed with axes and stout lances, on one of these dangerous\r\nexpeditions. When about a hundred paces from the bear’s den, the party\r\nhalted, and one of the Lapps advanced shouting, and his comrades made\r\nall the din they could. He ventured within twenty paces of the cavern,\r\nand then threw stones into it. For awhile all was quiet, and Hogguer\r\nbegan to think they had come upon an empty den; but suddenly an angry\r\ngrowl was heard.\r\n\r\nThe hunters now renewed and redoubled their clamour, until slowly,\r\nlike an honest citizen roused from his virtuous sleep by a company of\r\nroisterers, the animal came forth from his lair.\r\n\r\nAt first he seemed indifferent and lethargic; but, catching sight\r\nof his nearest enemy, he was filled with rage, uttered a short but\r\nterrible roar, and rushed headlong upon him. The Lapp, with his lance\r\nin rest, awaited the onset calmly, while the bear, coming to close\r\nquarters, reared himself on his haunches, and struck at his antagonist\r\nwith his fore paws.\r\n\r\nTo avoid these powerful strokes, the daring huntsman crouched, and\r\nthen, with a sudden spring, drove his lance, impelled by a sturdy arm,\r\nand guided by a sure eye, into the creature’s heart.\r\n\r\nThe victor escaped with only a slight wound on the hand, but the marks\r\nof the bear’s teeth were found deeply impressed on the iron spear-head.\r\n\r\nAccording to an old custom, the wives of the hunters assemble in one\r\nof their huts, and as soon as they hear them returning, raise a loud\r\ndiscordant chant in honour of the bear. When the men, loaded with\r\ntheir booty of skin and flesh, draw near, it is considered necessary\r\nto receive them with words of reproach and insult, and they are not\r\nallowed to enter through the door; they are compelled, therefore, to\r\nobtain admission through a hole in the wall. But when the animal’s\r\n_manes_ have been thus propitiated, the women are not less eager\r\nthan the men to make the most of its carcass; and after the skin, fat,\r\nand flesh have been removed, they cut up the body, and bury it with\r\ngreat ceremony, the head first, then the neck, next the fore paws, and\r\nso on, down to the animal’s “last,”--its tail. This is done from a wild\r\nbelief that the bear rises from the dead, and if it has been properly\r\ninterred, will kindly allow itself to be killed a second time by the\r\nsame hunter!\r\n\r\nThe principal article of food of the Lapps is reindeer venison. This\r\nthey boil, and it supplies them both with meat and broth. In summer\r\nthey vary their bill of fare with cheese and reindeer milk; and the\r\nrich eat a kind of bread or cake, baked upon hot iron plates or\r\n“girdles.” For luxuries they resort to brandy and tobacco; and these\r\nare not less appreciated by the women than by the men. As for the\r\nlatter, they are never seen without a pipe, except at meals; and the\r\nfirst salutation which a Lapp addresses to a stranger is a demand for\r\n“tabak” or “braendi.” Dr. Clarke tells us that on paying a visit to\r\none of their tents, he gave the father of the family about a pint of\r\nbrandy, and as he saw him place it behind his bed, near the margin of\r\nthe tent, he concluded it would be economically used. In a few minutes\r\nthe daughter entered, and asked for a dram, on the ground that she had\r\nlost her share while engaged upon domestic duties outside. The old Lapp\r\nmade no reply, but slily crept round the exterior of the tent until he\r\ncame to the place where the brandy was concealed. Then, thrusting in\r\nhis arm, he drew forth the precious bottle, and emptied its contents at\r\na draught.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe find no great difference of habits existing between the Mountain\r\nLapp and the Skogs or Forest Lapp, except that the latter takes up\r\nfishing as a summer pursuit, and devotes the winter months to his herds\r\nand the chase. But in course of time his herds demanding more attention\r\nthan he can give to them, he is transformed into a Fisher Lapp, who\r\ndwells always upon the sea-coast, and is at once the filthiest and\r\nleast civilized of the race. He resembles the Mountain Lapp in his love\r\nof tobacco and brandy. He differs from him in never migrating, and in\r\nwholly abandoning the pastoral life.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FISHER LAPPS.]\r\n\r\nA picture of what the artists call a Lapland “interior,” of the\r\ndomestic economy of a Lapp hut, is painted for us by the author of a\r\nrecent book of travel, entitled “Try Lapland.”\r\n\r\nAfter a long day’s journey, in the neighbourhood of Lake Randejaur,\r\nweary and cold, he and his companions came upon a small hut, and had\r\nvisions of obtaining a night’s rest; but a closer acquaintance with the\r\nhut convinced them that such a proceeding would be undesirable.\r\n\r\nFor, knocking at the door, and pulling up the latch, they entered, to\r\nsee before them a family scene!\r\n\r\nIn an inconceivably dirty room stood a still dirtier beldame, making\r\ncoffee. Her husband, an old man of seventy, sat on one side; while a\r\nhideous, deformed little Lapp, whether man or woman they could hardly\r\ntell, squatted on the floor on the other, in full costume, consisting\r\nof high-peaked blue cloth cap, and reindeer-skin dress, ornamented\r\nwith beads and spangles. Her face was brown as a berry, long lanky\r\nblack hair streamed down her cheeks; and, staring at the intruders, she\r\nbegged for “penge” (money). Two young men were snoring in one bed, and\r\ntwo boys in another placed opposite to it, each being covered with a\r\nfew reindeer-skins.\r\n\r\nThe entrance of the strangers aroused the sleepers to give one hasty\r\nlook, and then they snored again.\r\n\r\nThe lady of the house offered coffee; and though everything looked so\r\ndirty as to create a positive feeling of disgust, the travellers could\r\nnot afford to be particular, and accepted her offer, which put her in a\r\nperfect ecstasy of delight.\r\n\r\nQuickly she scuttled off to the well for water, and, filling her\r\nkettle, set to work to roast fresh coffee.\r\n\r\nThe old man got up and endeavoured to rouse the sleepers, when he\r\nunderstood that the strangers were in immediate want of boats and\r\nrowers.\r\n\r\nLeaving him to make the necessary preparations, they went out to take\r\na look at the surrounding scenery; and returning in a quarter of an\r\nhour, expected to find them preparing the boats, which lay two or three\r\nhundred yards off. But, to their surprise, not the slightest change had\r\noccurred in the position of the sleepers; and, after drinking their\r\ncoffee out of the one cup the Lapps possessed, they grew impatient, and\r\nstormed at the young men, trying even to pull them out of bed--but they\r\nwould not budge.\r\n\r\n“The father,” says our authority, “who protested great love for the\r\nEnglish, but turned out the biggest rascal we had come across, was as\r\nanxious as we were that his sons should get up and row us;--but not\r\na bit of it! He told us that they had been out three days and three\r\nnights on the Fells, and were thoroughly exhausted. What was to be\r\ndone, we could not think. It was getting serious; we certainly could\r\nnot sleep in this dreadful hole, and there was no other shelter near.\r\n\r\n“Money had no power: though I showed the almighty dollar to the weary\r\nslumberers, (they had surely never been in America!) they turned away\r\nwith a grunt.\r\n\r\n“Then, O happy thought, I recollected the _brandy_; and bringing\r\nmy keg to the bedside, I tapped it, and offered them a glass if they\r\nwould get up. This was quite another thing; they yawned, stretched\r\ntheir limbs, and stood upon the floor. Poor fellows! we then saw how\r\nill and fagged they looked, though they were splendid specimens of the\r\nhuman race.\r\n\r\n“Pouring a glass of the fiery compound down their throats, they put on\r\ntheir coats, and followed us like sleepy dogs; but in a few moments\r\nwere rowing us like heroes.”\r\n\r\nAll travellers agree in bearing witness to the passion of the Lapps for\r\nalcoholic liquors. If we could spare our apostles of temperance and\r\nadvocates of Good Templarism, which, alas! we cannot afford to do, few\r\nbetter fields could be found for their admirable labours than Lapland.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCaptain Hutchinson, however, has more pleasant experiences to relate,\r\nand more agreeable “interiors” to sketch, than the preceding. Let us\r\naccompany him, for instance, on a visit to the island of Bjorkholm.\r\n\r\nThe settlement here is very small, consisting of only two or three\r\nhouses, and a few barns and sheds. The inhabitants, after the usual\r\nmanner of the Lapps, support themselves by fishing in summer, and by\r\nthe reindeer in winter. Not a tree or shrub grows upon the island; only\r\ngrass.\r\n\r\nThe hostess, on this occasion, was an active, good-natured little\r\nwoman, not more than four feet high, who flew to and fro with a really\r\nwonderful agility. At one moment she was mounted on the dresser,\r\nsearching for forks and spoons; at another, almost buried in a deep\r\nbox, diving for sheets and table-cloth. Crockery was decidedly scarce;\r\nand a china slop-basin, with a wreath of prettily painted little\r\nflowers round the margin, had really a hard time of it.\r\n\r\nIt was first presented to Captain Hutchinson and his party for the\r\npurpose of washing their hands; at supper it appeared filled with\r\nchocolate; in the morning it reappeared as their joint washing-basin.\r\n\r\nHowever, the little Lapp entertained them right royally, with hot\r\nkippered salmon, pancakes, dried reindeer, and eggs.\r\n\r\nThe beds were very comfortable, the mattresses of hay, with the whitest\r\nof sheets. And though the hostess and her family seemed very poor,\r\nrelics of former grandeur were visible in the silver spoons, teapot,\r\ngoblet, and cream-jug.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA recent writer observes that the inferiority of the Lapp race is\r\nas conspicuous from the intellectual as from the physical point of\r\nview. This is evident from the most cursory glance at their lives\r\nand manners. The Lapp is, on the whole, a simple, timid, regular,\r\nhonest creature. To his great defect we have already adverted,--that\r\nexcessive partiality for strong liquors, which would be sufficient\r\nto bring about the annihilation of his race within a more or less\r\nlimited period, even if his days were not numbered from every other\r\nconcurrent cause. He is essentially nomadic. He is perfectly free and\r\nindependent throughout the solitary wastes which extend from the North\r\nCape to the sixty-fourth degree of latitude; he plants his tent where\r\nhe pleases, generally close to a wood or lake; and he moves on when\r\nthe moss all around it has been eaten up. Such a mode of life is, of\r\ncourse, incompatible with the progress of Swedish, Norwegian, and even\r\nFinlandish civilization, which, year by year, curtails the territory\r\ngiven up to the migration of the nomadic Lapps.\r\n\r\nThere is about the life of the Lapps, in summer, says Count D’Almeida,\r\na certain charm of independence, which might prove seductive to\r\ncertain minds, weary of civilization and unwitting of mosquitoes.\r\nBut in winter, no being of any other race could with impunity endure\r\nsuch privations and sufferings as they undergo. They are compelled to\r\nkeep a careful watch upon their herds, which are in constant danger\r\nfrom the snow-storms and the wolves. In the hard frosts, when the\r\nsnow is upwards of three feet in depth, they are compelled to dig it\r\nup with their axes, so as to obtain access for their reindeer to the\r\nmoss, which constitutes their only food in winter. Their vigorous\r\nconstitutions and their power of enduring privation and climatic\r\nrigour, explain how it was that man, in the Glacial Age, though without\r\nany of the appliances of civilization, could endure its tremendous\r\nseverity. What the Lapps can bear in point of toil and want is almost\r\nincredible. They suffer, and are strong, in a sense the poet never\r\ncontemplated. It frequently happens that they are surprised by a\r\nsnow-hurricane; they sleep on the ground, covered with snow-flakes,\r\nwhich, on awaking, they simply shake off, and pursue their way. In an\r\nexcess of cold which would chill our blood, even if we were running\r\nat the top of our speed, they will fall, in a fit of intoxication, on\r\nthe ground, and lie there with impunity for hours. It is said that in\r\nmid-winter, women, suddenly seized with the pains of childbirth while\r\non the road, are delivered in the snow, without any ill result, either\r\nto them or their offspring.\r\n\r\nBut, as the same writer remarks, human strength cannot exceed certain\r\nlimits. The Lapp ages early in life, and dies young. When he attains an\r\nadvanced age, his fate is still more lamentable. It is said that if an\r\nold man falls sick while a tribe is accomplishing one of its customary\r\nmigrations, his children frequently abandon him,--leaving him with some\r\nprovisions at the foot of a tree, or on the bank of a stream, with the\r\nterrible prospect before him of dying of starvation, or falling a prey\r\nto wild beasts. The Lapp is always poor even when he may be called\r\nrich; for it is calculated that to maintain a family of four persons,\r\na herd of fully four hundred reindeer is necessary, representing a\r\ncapital of about £160.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Lapp dialect is described as resembling the Finnish. When we\r\nremember that the Lapps and the Quénes, or Finns, wear a similar\r\ncostume, are distinguished by very similar customs, and that the\r\ntwo people call themselves by the same generic name, Suomi, we can\r\nunderstand why some travellers persist in regarding them as sprung\r\nfrom the same common stock. But a careful investigation shows the\r\nabsolute distinctness of the Lapps from the Finns, notwithstanding\r\nthis similarity of name and language--a similarity due, as in many\r\nother countries, to the influences of conquest or colonization. Some\r\nethnologists, and among them M. D’Omalins, include the Finns among\r\nthe white, or Caucasian race, and leave the Lapps among the inferior\r\nbranches of the great Mongol family. It seems certain that a greater\r\ndifference exists between the Quénes and the Lapps of Northern Norway\r\nthan between the Quénes and the Scandinavians of the same region.\r\n\r\nThe Quénes have adapted themselves completely to sedentary and\r\nagricultural habits, while the Lapps, as yet, have not made a single\r\nadvance in the direction of raising themselves above a pastoral and\r\nnomadic life. On the other hand, Finns constantly intermarry with the\r\nSwedes or Norwegians; while unions between Lapps and Scandinavians,\r\nor even between Lapps and Finns, are regarded throughout the entire\r\ncountry as monstrous anomalies. Lastly: laying aside the arguments\r\nfounded upon the physical conformation of the Lapps and the Finns,\r\nan important historical consideration seems to prove their distinct\r\nco-existence from a period far anterior to the settlement of the\r\nSuiones and the Goths in the peninsula; it is that in the Finnish\r\nmythology we constantly meet with legends of battles between dwarfs and\r\ngiants. It is impossible that these can refer to the warfare between\r\nthe Finns and the Scandinavians, for the latter were of the same\r\nstature as the former; and it is in comparison with the Lapps only that\r\nthe Finns could relatively be called _giants_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe borrow from Count D’Alviella a few particulars relating to\r\nthe stationary Lapps, who inhabit the region of West Bothnia, or\r\nWesterbotten, a long, narrow strip of land dividing the Gulf of Bothnia\r\nfrom Lapland proper. These Lapps seem to be the product of a mixture of\r\nraces in which the Scandinavian element predominates. They are of an\r\nordinary stature, robust, with regular features, light hair, and clear\r\ngray eyes.\r\n\r\nThe country in which they dwell has a strange, an original, but a\r\nmonotonous character. It is its monotony which wearies the traveller,\r\nthough at first he will be impressed by its fresh yet severe beauty.\r\nThe forests of birch and fir seem endless, and the great lakes\r\nin their depths fatigue the eye with their wastes of cold, drear\r\nwater. Occasionally, however, the traveller comes upon a smiling\r\nplain, enamelled with myosotis, and brightened by a silver-shining,\r\nmusic-murmuring stream. Here and there the wood is thinner, and lean\r\ncows may be seen feeding among the half-stripped stems. Next comes a\r\nclearing, where the forest has been swept away by fire; a clearing with\r\nfields of rye and barley; a palisade enclosure, and a group of châlets,\r\nwith a comparatively spacious and undilapidated building in the centre.\r\n\r\nThese _gârds_, as they are called, closely resemble each other\r\nthroughout the North. Neither material nor space is begrudged to the\r\nWest Bothnian architects. Even the smallest farm comprises three or\r\nfour buildings, which generally form a square on the four sides of\r\nan inner court. These buildings--how unlike the wretched, filthy\r\nhut of the nomadic Lapp!--comprise three living-rooms, kitchen, and\r\nstables; and are divided from each other only by a partition of\r\nhorizontally-laid planks, the interstices being filled up by moss.\r\nThe furniture is simple, convenient, suitable, and shining with\r\ncleanliness, like a Dutch kitchen. Around the hearth is hung a series\r\nof brightly-coloured prints, representing either a Scriptural scene\r\nor events in the life of an illustrious personage,--King Charles\r\nXV., or the bishop of the diocese, side by side with the universal\r\nlegendary figures, Napoleon I. and Garibaldi. Close by stands the old\r\nhereditary locker, in which the husband accumulates his money and the\r\nwife deposits her trinkets; to the wall is suspended a complete trophy\r\nof knives, pipes, belts with silver buckles, sledge-bells, and a whip\r\nwith a carved horn handle. The whole scene is one of order and the\r\nproprieties of family life.\r\n\r\nAll these dwellings, it may be added, do not wear the same aspect\r\nof prosperous neatness; but even where poverty is present, it is\r\nunaccompanied by that sullen gloom and melancholy squalidness which, in\r\nother countries, is the painful indication and result of long-endured\r\nprivation. And here, we must also remember, poverty and famine are not\r\nalways inseparable companions. The shadow of hunger frequently darkens\r\nthe rich man’s door, and a man might perish for want of food on a sack\r\nof gold. One winter, the wealthiest members of the community were\r\nreduced to the necessity of eating bread made of bark mixed with moss.\r\n\r\nStill, we see how wide a difference separates the stationary from the\r\nnomadic Lapp, and how impossible it is for a wandering population to\r\nacquire or appreciate the comforts of civilized life. A pastoral race,\r\nin the present age of the world, is, and must be, a decaying, because a\r\nbarbarous race. If it touches the borders of civilization, it is only\r\nto become infected with its vices, and thus to hasten its inevitable\r\ndecay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n            THE SAMOJEDES AND OTHER TRIBES OF ARCTIC ASIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Samojedes are the immediate neighbours of the Lapps. Like them,\r\nthey are nomads; but they are even less civilized, and have profited\r\nless by the arduous and enthusiastic labours of the Christian\r\nmissionaries. They range over the forests and stony tundras of Northern\r\nRussia and Western Siberia; driving their reindeer herds from the banks\r\nof the Chatanga to the icy shores of the White Sea, or hunting the wild\r\nbeasts in the dense woods which extend between the Obi and the Yenisei.\r\n\r\nThey are sunk far deeper than the Lapps in a coarse and debasing\r\nsuperstition. It is true that they believe in a supreme deity--Num,\r\nor Jilibeambaertje, who resides in the air, and, like the Greek Zeus,\r\nsends down thunder and lightning, rain and snow; and they evince that\r\nlatent capacity for poetical feeling which is indicated even by the\r\nmost barbarous tribes in their description of the rainbow as “the\r\nhem of his garment.” They regard him, however, as so elevated above\r\nthe world of man, and so coldly indifferent to humanity, that it is\r\nuseless to seek to propitiate him either by prayer or sacrifice; and\r\nthey have recourse, accordingly, to the inferior gods,--who, as they\r\nbelieve, have the direction of human affairs, and are influenced by\r\nincantations, vows, or special homage.\r\n\r\nThe chief of all the Samojede idols is still supposed to consecrate\r\nwith its presence, as in the days of the adventurous Barentz, the bleak\r\nand ice-bound island of Waigatz. It is a block of stone, pointed at\r\nthe summit, and bearing some rude resemblance to a human head, having\r\nbeen fashioned after this likeness by a freak of nature. This has\r\nformed the model for the Samojede sculptors, who have multiplied its\r\neffigy in wood and stone; and the idols thus easily created they call\r\n_sjadæi_, because they wear a human (or semi-human) countenance\r\n(_sja_). They attire them in reindeer-skins, and embellish them\r\nwith innumerable coloured rags. In addition to the _sjadæi_,\r\nthey adopt as idols any curiously contorted tree or irregularly\r\nshaped stone; and the household idol (Hahe) they carry about with\r\nthem, carefully wrapped up, in a sledge reserved for the purpose, the\r\nhahengan. One of the said penates is supposed to be the guardian of\r\nwedded happiness, another of the fishery, a third of the health of his\r\nworshippers, a fourth of their herds of reindeer. When his services are\r\nrequired, the Hahe is removed from his resting-place, and erected in\r\nthe tent or on the pasture-ground, in the wood or on the river’s bank.\r\nThen his mouth is smeared with oil or blood, and before him is set a\r\ndish of flesh or fish, in return for which repast it is expected that\r\nhe will use his power on behalf of his entertainers. His aid being no\r\nlonger needed, he is returned to the hahengan.\r\n\r\nBesides these obliging deities, the Samojede believes in the existence\r\nof an order of invisible spirits which he calls _Tadebtsios_.\r\nThese are ever and everywhere around him, and bent rather upon his\r\ninjury than his welfare. It becomes important, therefore, to propitiate\r\nthem; but this can be done only through the interposition of a\r\n_Tadibe_, or sorcerer; who, on occasion, stimulates himself into\r\na state of wild excitement, like the frenzy of the Pythian or Delphic\r\npriestess. When his aid is invoked by the credulous Samojede, his first\r\ncare is to attire himself in full magician’s costume--a kind of shirt,\r\nmade of reindeer leather, and hemmed with red cloth. Its seams are\r\ntrimmed in like manner; and the shoulders are also decorated with red\r\ncloth tags, or epaulettes. A piece of red cloth is worn over the face\r\nas a mask, and a plate of polished metal gleams upon his breast.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SAMOJEDE HUTS ON WAIGATZ ISLAND.]\r\n\r\nThus costumed, the Tadibe takes his drum of reindeer-skin, ornamented\r\nwith brass rings, and, attended by a neophyte, walks round and round\r\nwith great stateliness, while invoking the presence of the spirits\r\nby a discordant rattle. This gradually increases in violence, and is\r\naccompanied by the droning intonation of the words of enchantment. The\r\nspirits in due time appear, and the Tadibe proceeds to consult them;\r\nbeating his drum more gently, and occasionally pausing in his doleful\r\nchant,--which, however, the novice is careful not to interrupt,--to\r\nlisten, as is supposed, to the answers of the aerial divinities. At\r\nlength the conversation ceases; the chant breaks into a fierce howl;\r\nthe drum rattles more and more loudly; the Tadibe seems under a\r\nsupernatural influence; his body quivers, and foam gathers on his lips.\r\nThen suddenly the frenzy ceases, and the Tadibe utters the will of the\r\nTadebtsios, and gives advice how a straying reindeer may be recovered,\r\nor the disease of the Samojede worshipper relieved, or the fisherman’s\r\nlabour rewarded with an abundant “harvest of the sea.”\r\n\r\nThe office of the Tadibe is usually transmitted from father to son;\r\nbut occasionally some individual, predisposed by nature to fits of\r\nexcitement, and endowed with a vivid imagination, is initiated into\r\nits mysteries. His morbid fancy is worked upon by long solitary\r\nself-communings and protracted fasts and vigils, and his frame by the\r\nuse of pernicious narcotics and stimulants, until he persuades himself\r\nthat he has been visited by the spirits. He is then received as a\r\nTadibe with many ceremonies, which take place at midnight, and he is\r\ninvested with the magic drum. It will be seen, therefore, that the\r\nTadibe, if he deceives others, partly deceives himself. But he does not\r\ndisdain to have recourse to the commonest tricks of the conjuror, with\r\nthe view of imposing upon his ignorant countrymen. Among these is the\r\nfamous rope-trick, introduced into England by the Davenport Brothers,\r\nand since repeated by so many professional necromancers. With his hands\r\nand feet fastened, he sits down on a carpet of reindeer-skin, and, the\r\nlights being put out, invokes the spirits to come to his assistance.\r\nSoon their presence is made known by strange noises; squirrels seem to\r\nrustle, snakes to hiss, and bears to growl. At length the disturbance\r\nceases, the lights are rekindled, and the Tadibe steps forward unbound;\r\nthe spectators, of course, believing that he has been assisted by the\r\nTadebtsios.\r\n\r\nAs barbarous, says Dr. Hartwig--to whose pages we are here indebted--as\r\nbarbarous as the poor wretches who submit to his guidance, the Tadibe\r\nis incapable of improving their moral condition, and has no wish\r\nto do so. Under various names,--_Schamans_ among the Tungusi,\r\n_Angekoks_ among the Eskimos, _Medicine-men_ among the Crees\r\nand Chepewyans,--we find similar magicians or impostors assuming a\r\nspiritual dictatorship over all the Arctic nations of the Old and the\r\nNew World, wherever their authority has not been broken by Christianity\r\nor Buddhism; and this dreary faith still extends its influence over at\r\nleast half a million of souls, from the White Sea to the extremity of\r\nAsia, and from the Pacific to Hudson Bay.\r\n\r\nThe Samojedes, like the Siberian tribes, offer up sacrifices to the\r\ndead, and perform various ceremonies in honour of their memory. Like\r\nthe North American Indians, they believe that the desires and pursuits\r\nof the departed continue to be the same as they were on earth; and\r\nhence, that they may not be in want of weapons or implements, they\r\ndeposit in or about their graves a sledge, a spear, a cooking-pot,\r\na knife, an axe. At the funeral, and for several years afterwards,\r\nthe kinsmen sacrifice reindeer over the grave. When a prince dies,\r\na Starschina, the owner, perhaps, of several herds of reindeer, his\r\nnearest relatives fashion an image, which is kept in the tent of the\r\ndeceased, and to which as much respect is paid as was paid to the man\r\nhimself in his lifetime. It occupies his usual seat at every meal;\r\nevery evening it is undressed, and laid down in his bed. For three\r\nyears these honours are kept up, and then the image is buried, from\r\na belief that the body by that time must have decayed, and lost all\r\nrecollection of the past. Only the souls of the Tadibes, and of those\r\nwho have died a violent death, are privileged with immortality, and\r\nhover about the air as disembodied spirits.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A SAMOJEDE FAMILY.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Samojedes are scattered--to the number of about a thousand\r\nfamilies--over their wild and inhospitable region. Ethnologists\r\ngenerally consider them to have a common origin with the Finns of\r\nEurope. In stature they are somewhat taller than the Lapps, and their\r\ncolour is more of a tawny. The marked features of their countenance\r\nrecall the Hindu type. The forehead is high, the hair black, the nose\r\nlong, the mouth well-formed; but the sunken eye, veiled by a heavy\r\nlid, expresses a cruel and perfidious nature. The manners of the\r\nSamojedes are brutal; and in character they are fierce and cunning.\r\nThey are shepherds, hunters, traders--and when opportunity serves,\r\nrobbers. Like the other Arctic peoples, they clothe themselves in\r\nreindeer-skins. They shave off their hair, except a tolerably large\r\ntuft which they allow to flourish on the top of the head, and they\r\npluck out the beard as fast as it grows. The women decorate their\r\npersons with a belt of gilded copper, and with a profusion of glass\r\nbeads and metallic ornaments.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nContinuing our progress eastward, we come to the Ostiaks, a people\r\nspreading over the northernmost parts of Siberia, from the Oural\r\nMountains to Kamtschatka.\r\n\r\nSome interesting particulars of their habits and customs are recorded\r\nby Madame Felinska, a Polish lady whom the Russian Government condemned\r\nto a long exile in Siberia.\r\n\r\nOne day, when she was seeking a pathway through a wood, she fell in\r\nwith a couple of Ostiaks on the point of performing their devotions.\r\nThese are of the simplest kind: the worshipper places himself before a\r\ntree (the larch, by preference) in the densest recess of the forest,\r\nand indulges in a succession of extravagant gestures and contortions.\r\nAs this form of worship is prohibited by the Russian Government, the\r\nOstiak can resort to it only in secret. He professes, indeed, to have\r\naccepted Christianity, but there is too much reason to fear that the\r\nmajority of the race are still attached to their heathen creed.\r\n\r\nNearly every Ostiak carries about his person a rude image of one of the\r\ndeities which he adores under the name of _Schaïtan_; but this\r\ndoes not prevent him from wearing a small crucifix of copper on his\r\nbreast. The _Schaïtan_ is a rough imitation of the human figure,\r\ncarved out of wood. It is of different sizes, according to the various\r\nuses for which it is intended: if for carrying on the person, it is a\r\nminiature doll; but for decorating the Ostiak’s hut an image can be\r\nhad on a larger scale. It is always attired in seven pearl-embroidered\r\nchemises, and suspended to the neck by a string of silver coins. The\r\nwooden deity occupies the place of honour in every hut,--sometimes in\r\ncompany with an image of the Virgin Mary or some saint,--and before\r\nbeginning a repast the Ostiaks are careful to offer it the daintiest\r\nmorsels, smearing its lips with fish or raw game; this sacred duty\r\nperformed, they finish their meal in contentment.\r\n\r\nThe priests of the Ostiaks are called _Schamans_; their immense\r\ninfluence they employ to promote their own personal interests, and\r\nmaintain the meanest superstitions.\r\n\r\nIn summer the Ostiak fixes his residence on the banks of the Obi or\r\none of its tributaries. It is generally square in form, with low stone\r\nwalls, and a high pointed roof made of willow-branches, and covered\r\nwith pieces of bark. These having been softened by boiling, are sewn\r\ntogether so as to form large mats or carpets, which are easily rolled\r\nup and carried from place to place. The hearth is in the centre; it\r\nconsists of a few stones set round a cavity in the soil. Here the\r\nOstiak lives; supporting himself on fish, which he frequently eats\r\nwithout cooking--and purchasing a few occasional luxuries, such as\r\ntobacco and drink, with the salmon and sturgeon caught by his dexterity.\r\n\r\nIn winter he withdraws into the woods, to hunt the sable or the\r\nsquirrel, or to pasture the herds of reindeer which some of them\r\npossess. He builds his jurt on a small eminence near the bank of a\r\nstream, but out of reach of its spring inundations. It is low, small,\r\nsqualid; its walls plastered with clay; its window made of a thin sheet\r\nof ice.\r\n\r\nThe Ostiaks are generally of small stature, dark-complexioned, and with\r\nblack hair, like the Samojedes; but this is not invariably the case.\r\nThey seem to belong to the same family as the Samojedes and Finns.\r\nThey are honest, good-natured, inert, and extremely careless and dirty\r\nin their habits; though it may be conceded that their huts are not\r\nfilthier than the “interiors” of the Icelandic fishermen. Their women\r\nare not much better treated than African slaves, and are given in\r\nmarriage to the highest bidder. The price necessarily varies according\r\nto the condition of the parent; the daughter of a rich man sells for\r\nfifty reindeer, of a poor man for half-a-dozen dried sturgeon and a\r\nhandful of squirrel-skins.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: JAKUT HUNTER AND BEAR.]\r\n\r\nThe Ostiaks and the Samojedes are great hunters of the white bear.\r\nIt is the same with the Jakuts (or Yakouts), a people dwelling near\r\nthe Bouriats, and, like them, approximating to the Mongol type. Their\r\nobject in the chase, however, is not always to kill the animal, but\r\nto take it alive. Madame Felinska asserts that, one day, she saw a\r\nconsiderable herd of bears conducted to Bérézov, like a herd of tame\r\ncattle, and apparently quite as inoffensive. She does not inform us,\r\nhowever, by what means they had been reduced to such a desirable\r\nstate of subjection. Frequently the Ostiaks and the Jakuts attack the\r\nwhite bears body to body, without any other weapon than a hatchet or\r\nlong cutlass. They require to strike their formidable antagonist with\r\nimmense vigour, and to slay it at the first blow, or their own danger\r\nis extreme. Should the hunter miss his stroke, his sole resource is to\r\nfling himself on the ground and lie motionless, until the bear, while\r\nsmelling his body and turning him over, incautiously offers himself\r\nagain to his attack.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe now reach the peninsula of Kamtschatka. In area it is equal to Great\r\nBritain, and its natural resources are abundant; yet, owing to the\r\nravages of smallpox, and excessive brandy-drinking, its population does\r\nnot exceed seven or eight thousand souls. Its climate is much milder\r\nthan that of the interior of Siberia, being favourably affected by the\r\nwarm breezes from the sea; and though cereals do not flourish, its\r\npasture-grounds are rich and ample, and its herbaceous vegetation is\r\nexceedingly abundant.\r\n\r\nThe fisheries of Kamtschatka enjoy a well-deserved reputation. In\r\nspring the salmon ascend its rivers in such astonishingly numerous\r\nlegions, that it you plunge a dart into the water you will surely\r\nstrike a fish; and Steller asserts that the bears and dogs in this\r\nfortunate region catch on the banks with their paws and mouths more\r\nfish than in less favoured countries the most skilful anglers can\r\nensnare by all the devices of piscatorial science. Hermann also refers\r\nto the teeming myriads of the Kamtschatka waters. In a stream only six\r\ninches deep he saw countless hosts of chackos (_Slagocephalus_),\r\ntwo or three feet in length, partly stranded on the grassy banks,\r\npartly attempting to force a passage through the shallows.\r\n\r\nThe coasts of Kamtschatka swarm in like manner with aquatic birds,\r\nwhich roost and breed on every crag and ledge, in every niche and\r\nhollow, and at the slightest alarm rise from their resting-places with\r\na whirr of wings and a clamour of voices repeated by a thousand echoes.\r\n\r\nThe Kamtschatkans display in the pursuit of these birds and their eggs\r\na skill and a daring not inferior to the intrepidity and dexterity of\r\nthe inhabitants of the Faroe Isles or the Hebrides. Barefooted, and\r\nwithout even the aid of ropes, they venture to descend the most awful\r\ndeclivities, which the foaming waters render inaccessible from below.\r\nOn the left arm hangs a basket, to be filled with eggs as they advance;\r\nin the right hand they carry a short iron hook, with which to drag the\r\nbirds from their rocky roosts. When a bird is caught, the fowler wrings\r\nits neck, slings it to his girdle, and lowers himself still further\r\ndown the rugged precipice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Kamtschatkans are of small stature, but strong-limbed and\r\nbroad-shouldered. Their cheek-bones are high, their jaws massive,\r\nbroad, and prominent, their eyes small and black, their noses small,\r\ntheir lips very full. The prevailing colour of the men is a dark brown,\r\nsometimes approaching to tawny; the complexion of the women is fairer;\r\nand to preserve it from the sun, they embellish it with bears’ guts,\r\nadhering to the face by means of fish-lime. They also paint their\r\ncheeks a brilliant red with a sea-weed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: KAMTSCHATKANS.]\r\n\r\nKamtschatka boasts of a very valuable domestic animal in its dog.\r\nMr. Hill is of opinion that he must be considered indigenous to the\r\ncountry, where he roves wild upon the hills, and obtains his existence\r\nin exactly the same manner as the wolf. In his nature, both physically\r\nand in respect to his temper and disposition, he seems about equally to\r\nresemble that tameless animal and the mastiff; yet not altogether in\r\nthe same manner that might be supposed to arise from the cross breed\r\nof the two species, but rather as possessing some of the qualities\r\nof both, neither confounded nor modified, but distinctly marked, and\r\nperhaps in equal perfection to the same qualities possessed severally\r\nby those animals. He is about the size of the ordinary mastiff, and\r\nhis colour is usually buff or silver-gray, with the several darker or\r\nlighter shades of these colours as an invariable basis. In the form\r\nof his body, too, he resembles the mastiff, but his head is more like\r\nthat of the wolf. Still more do we recognize the wolfish character\r\nin the eye, which is cruel and furtive, as well as in his habits and\r\ndisposition. Like his fellow-rover, he sleeps more by day than by\r\nnight, and he sees better through the scanty light afforded by the\r\nstars or moon than in the full radiance of the sun: this has given\r\nrise to the same vulgar error concerning his vision which, in Britain,\r\nprevails respecting that of the cat,--that he can see in the dark.\r\n\r\nIf there be any exception, says Mr. Hill, to the distinct manner in\r\nwhich the dog of Kamtschatka possesses the character and qualities of\r\nboth the wolf and mastiff, it is in regard to his voice, which is heard\r\nin loud cries and undistinguishable sounds, something between the bark\r\nof the one and the howl of the other.\r\n\r\nIn all things connected with the labour in which he is engaged, the\r\nKamtschatka dog displays a more than ordinary intelligence. He is very\r\neager to work, and obedient, like the canine species generally, to one\r\nmaster only; but he gives no indications of that attachment which, more\r\nor less, in all other species of the dog, enables man to sympathize\r\nwith them, and sometimes even excites a degree of friendship which\r\nnot every one of his own species is able to inspire. Thus, every pack\r\nor team of dogs must always be driven by the same hand and guided by\r\nthe same voice, which the whip, and not caresses, has taught them to\r\nremember and obey.\r\n\r\nWith these qualities, the dog becomes in this country a very\r\nserviceable animal. Whatever, indeed, our horses and bullocks perform\r\nfor us here in Britain, if we except carrying us on their backs and\r\nploughing our arable land, the dogs perform for the Kamtschatkans.\r\nThere is not much employment for them, however, in the summer; and at\r\nthat season they are allowed to range about and secure their food,\r\nwhich they usually find in the rivers, in the best way they can. Some\r\npains are at all times necessary to keep them in good temper and at\r\npeace with their neighbours, whether canine or human. And therefore all\r\nKamtschatkans who keep a team near their houses are careful, when the\r\nsnow is on the ground, to drive a number of stakes into the earth, or\r\npoles set up in the same manner as the frame of a hut or wigwam; and\r\nto these the dogs are attached singly or in pairs. But when paired,\r\nwhether at the stakes or in harness, it is requisite that those yoked\r\ntogether should be not only of the same family, but of the same litter,\r\nor at all events they should have been paired when they were puppies.\r\nIt is at no time safe to leave the greater part of them loose; and the\r\nyounger dogs are described as the most dangerous in this way. They will\r\nnot only at all times kill domestic fowls,--which the Kamtschatkans,\r\ntherefore, are unable to breed,--and dogs of the smaller species that\r\nmay chance to be brought to the place, but they have been known to\r\ndestroy children. While they do not work they are tolerably fat, and\r\nhave usually an allowance of half a dried salmon, or a portion weighing\r\nabout two pounds, a day; but when they labour they are worse treated\r\nand more stinted than the Siberian horses, and receive only half the\r\nquantity of food apportioned to them when at rest; yet they will, under\r\nthis treatment, perform journeys of three or four weeks’ duration with\r\nmuch less repose than the horses require. Nay, they will even, upon a\r\njourney of four or five days’ duration, work for fourteen or sixteen\r\nhours out of the twenty-four without tasting any food whatsoever,\r\nand without appearing to suffer any diminution of strength; and the\r\nuniversal opinion seems to be, that the less food they receive on this\r\nside of starvation, when travelling, the better.\r\n\r\nFive of these dogs will draw a sledge carrying three full-grown persons\r\nand sixty pounds weight of luggage. When lightly loaded, such a sledge\r\nwill travel from thirty to forty versts in a day over bad roads and\r\nthrough the deep snow, while on even roads it will accomplish eighty\r\nto one hundred and twenty. And herein lies the inestimable value of\r\nthe Kamtschatkan dogs, for the horse would be useless in sledging: in\r\nthe deep snow it would sink; and it would be unable, on account of its\r\nweight, to cross the rivers and streams which are covered only with a\r\nthin sheet of ice.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A KAMTSCHATKAN SLEDGE AND TEAM.]\r\n\r\nBut travelling with dogs is by no means easy. Instead of the whip, the\r\ndriver uses a crooked stick with iron rings, which, by their jingling,\r\nsupply the leader of the team with the necessary signals. If the dogs\r\nshow symptoms of relaxing in their efforts, the stick is cast among\r\nthem to rouse them to greater speed; and the driver dexterously picks\r\nit up again as his sledge shoots by. In a snow-storm they keep their\r\nmaster comfortably warm, and will lie round about him quietly for\r\nhours. They are experienced weather-prophets too, for if, when resting,\r\nthey dig holes in the snow, it is a certain sign of a storm.\r\n\r\nThe training of these dogs begins at a very early age. Soon after their\r\nbirth they are placed with their mother in a deep pit, so as to see\r\nneither man nor beast; and after being weaned, they are still condemned\r\nto a total exclusion from “the madding crowd.” A probation of six\r\nmonths having expired, they are attached to a sledge with older dogs,\r\nand being extremely shy, they run at their very fastest. On returning\r\nhome they undergo another period of pit-life, until they are considered\r\nperfectly trained, and capable of performing a long journey. They are\r\nthen allowed to enjoy their summer freedom. Such a mode of training\r\nmay render them docile and obedient, but it renders them also gloomy,\r\nmistrustful, and ill-tempered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSiberia, so far as the valley of the Lena is concerned, and even\r\neastward to the Kolima and westward to the Yenisei, is inhabited by\r\nthe bold and vigorous race of the Jakuts. Their number is computed at\r\nabout 200,000, and they inhabit the extensive but dreary province of\r\nJakutsk, with a chief town of the same name.\r\n\r\nThe Jakuts are to a great extent a pastoral people, but as they trade\r\nin horses and cattle, and also carry on a brisk fur-trade with the\r\nRussians, they have attained a far higher level of civilization than\r\nis common among pastoral races. In summer they live in light conical\r\ntents (“urossy”), which are fixed upon poles, and covered with birch\r\nrind. These they pitch in the open plains and valleys, and then devote\r\nthemselves to gathering supplies of hay against the coming winter. This\r\nis with them a very important labour, for their chief wealth is in\r\ntheir herds of cattle, and to find a sufficient provision for them in\r\nthe bleak climate of the Lena basin, and on the borders of the Arctic\r\nWorld, is a task of great difficulty. Often, indeed, the supply fails\r\nbefore the return of spring, and the oxen must then be fed upon the\r\nyoung shoots and saplings of the birch and willow.\r\n\r\nWhen winter approaches, the Jakut removes from his tent into a warm,\r\ntimber-built hut, or _jart_, which assumes the form of a truncated\r\npyramid, and has an exterior covering of turf and clay. Its windows\r\nare made of thin sheets of ice; which, as soon as a thaw sets in, are\r\nreplaced by fish-bladders or paper steeped in oil. The floor is of\r\nearth, very rarely boarded, and generally sunk two or three feet below\r\nthe surface of the ground. The seats and sleeping-berths are arranged\r\nalong the sides; the hearth, or _tscherwal_, occupies the centre,\r\nand its smoke finds an exit through an aperture in the roof. Clothes\r\nand weapons are suspended from the walls, and the general appearance of\r\nthe interior is squalid and disorderly.\r\n\r\nNear the jart are stalls for the cows; but when the cold is very\r\nintense, they, like the Irishman’s pigs, find accommodation in-doors.\r\nAs for the horses, they remain night and day in the open air, though\r\nthe weather may be so severe that even mercury freezes; and they have\r\nno other food than the decayed autumn grass, which they find under the\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\nThe capacity of endurance which the Jakut horses exhibit is almost\r\nincredible. Like other quadrupeds in the Arctic regions, they change\r\ntheir hair in summer. Traversing, month after month, the dreary\r\nwilderness where the only vegetation is a scanty and half-rotten grass,\r\nthey still retain their strength and energy; and notwithstanding the\r\nhard conditions of their lives, they do not age so quickly as our own\r\nmore carefully-tended steeds. To aim at improving the Jakut horse\r\nwould be, in the opinion of many travellers, to gild refined gold, and\r\nperfume “thrown on the violet.” He will continue a steady trot for\r\nhours, over roads of which no Englishman can form an idea, and stop to\r\ntake his rest with no other food but the bark of the larch and willow,\r\nor a little hard grass, no covering protecting his foaming sides from\r\nthe cold, and the temperature down at 40°.\r\n\r\nAs the horse, so the master. The Jakut is the very personification of\r\nhardiness. He seems able to endure anything, and to attempt everything.\r\nOn the longest winter-journey he carries neither tents nor extra\r\ncoverings with him, not even one of the large fur-dresses, such as\r\nthe Siberians generally use. He contents himself, in fact, with his\r\nusual dress; in this he generally sleeps in the open air: his bed, a\r\nhorse-rug stretched upon the snow; his pillow, a wooden saddle. With\r\nthe same fur jacket which serves him by daytime as a dress, and which\r\nhe pulls off when he lies down for the night, he defends his back and\r\nshoulders, while the front part of his body is turned towards the fire,\r\nalmost without any covering. He then stops his nose and ears with\r\nsmall pieces of skin, and covers his face so as to leave only a small\r\naperture for breathing; these are all the precautions he takes against\r\nthe severest cold. Even in Siberia the Jakuts are known as “iron men.”\r\n\r\nThe horse to the Jakut is as valuable and as important as the camel to\r\nthe Arab or the reindeer to the Lapp. It is not only his steed, which\r\nseems incapable of weariness,--his beast of draught, patient under\r\nheavy loads,--but its skin provides him with articles of dress; with\r\nits hair he makes his fishing-nets; boiled horse meat is his favourite\r\nfood, and sour mare’s milk, or _koumis_, his principal beverage.\r\nBy mixing this milk with rye flour, or the inner rind of the fir or\r\nlarch, he makes a thick porridge, which he flavours with berries, or\r\ndried fish, or rancid fat.\r\n\r\nBefore commerce had been diverted into the valley of the Amur,\r\nthousands of pack-horses, under the guidance of Jakuts, annually\r\ncrossed the Stanowoi hills on the way to Ochotsk; a journey of terrible\r\ndifficulty, which might appal the stoutest nerves. But the Jakut\r\nendures the extremes of cold and hunger with a wonderful equanimity.\r\nHe fears neither the stormy winds, the darkened heavens, the depth of\r\nthe treacherous morass, nor the darkness and silence of the forest.\r\nNothing appals him but the unseen presence of “Ljeschei,” the spirit\r\nof the mountain and the forest. The traveller frequently comes upon a\r\nfir-crowned hillock, and from the branches of one of the oldest firs\r\nsees suspended innumerable tufts of horse-hair. What does it mean? He\r\nneeds not to inquire, for, lo! his Jakut driver, dismounting from his\r\nsteed, hastens to pluck a few hairs from his horse’s mane, and then,\r\nwith much reverence, attaches them to the nearest bough, in order to\r\npropitiate the terrible Ljeschei. Even Jakuts who have been baptized,\r\nand are nominally enrolled among the Christian population, are guilty\r\nof this silly bit of superstition; while it is suspected, on good\r\ngrounds, that they still cherish their belief in Schamanism, and their\r\nancient dread of evil spirits. When we remember, however, the absurd\r\nbeliefs and vulgar errors still lingering in many parts of our own\r\nland, we are unable to pass a very severe verdict on the credulity of\r\nthe Jakuts.\r\n\r\nWhen on the road they beguile the tedium of the way by singing songs of\r\nthe most doleful character, corresponding to the habitual melancholy\r\nwhich they seem to have inherited from their forefathers; a melancholy\r\nsuggested, probably, by the gloom of the landscape, the chilling aspect\r\nof the sky, the inclemency of the climate, and the prolonged battle\r\nin which their lives are passed. Their songs, not the less, are songs\r\nworthy of a bold and intelligent people, and, like the poetry of the\r\nNorsemen, are replete with images borrowed from nature. They constantly\r\ndescribe in glowing language the lofty magnificence of the snow-crowned\r\nmountains, the starry beauty of the night, the roll and rush of the\r\nriver, the wail of the wind as it streams through a forest of pines.\r\nThe Jakut minstrels are mostly improvisatores; and, to secure the\r\nfavour of the Ljeschei, they will extol the charms of the wilderness\r\nover which it rules, as if that wilderness were a portion of Elysium.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Jakut merchants are remarkable for their enterprise. Their capital\r\nis Jakutsk, on the Lena, and thence they extend their operations in all\r\ndirections. In the rigour of winter they will lead their caravans to\r\nOchotsk, or Kjachta, or Ostrownoje.\r\n\r\nYet the country they traverse is at all times a desert. The mean\r\ntemperature of the year is only +14°. In November the thermometer sinks\r\nto -40°, or 72° below freezing-point. The Yana, at Nishni Kolymsk,\r\nfreezes early in September; and lower down, where the current is\r\nsluggish, loaded horses can cross its frozen surface as early as\r\nthe middle of August: yet the ice does not melt before June. The sun\r\nremains, it is true, about fifty-two days above the horizon; but its\r\nlight, shrouded by almost continual mists, is attended by but little\r\nheat,--and its orb, compressed by refraction into an elliptical form,\r\nmay be examined by the naked eye without inconvenience.\r\n\r\nAs the climate, so the vegetation. Dwarfish willow-shrubs, stunted\r\ngrass, moss, and a few berry-bearing plants compose the flora of the\r\ncheerless tundras. There is greater abundance and more variety in the\r\nneighbouring and better sheltered valleys of the Aniuj; the poplar,\r\nbirch, thyme, absinth, and low creeping cedar enliven their slopes; but\r\neven in these places Nature is most niggardly of her gifts. Such is not\r\nthe case, however, with the fauna of Arctic Siberia. The forests are\r\ntenanted by numbers of reindeer, elks, bears, foxes, sables, and gray\r\nsquirrels; while in the low grounds stone foxes make their burrows.\r\nWith the return of spring come immense flights of swans, geese, and\r\nducks, which build their nests in the most sequestered corners. The\r\nsea-coast is frequented by eagles, owls, and gulls; the brushwood by\r\nthe white ptarmigan; the brooks by hundreds of little snipes. Even the\r\nsongs of the finch are not wanting in spring, nor is the thrush wholly\r\nsilent in autumn.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSumming up the details recorded by Admiral Wrangell, a recent writer\r\ndraws an impressive picture of the mode of life of the people of this\r\ndesolate waste, and observes: “All denotes that here the limits of the\r\nhabitable earth are passed; and one asks with astonishment, What could\r\ninduce human beings to take up their abode in so comfortless a region?”\r\n\r\nThe chief resource of the Sullaheris of the River Aniuj is, he says,\r\nthe reindeer chase,--the success of which mainly determines whether\r\nfamine or some degree of plenty is to be their lot during the coming\r\nwinter. The passage of the reindeer takes place twice a year: in\r\nspring, when the mosquito-swarms drive them to the sea-coast, where\r\nthey feed on the moss of the tundra; and in autumn, when the increasing\r\ncold forces them to retire inland. The spring migration, which begins\r\nabout the middle of May, is not very profitable; partly because the\r\nanimals are then in poor condition, and partly because it is more\r\ndifficult to kill them as they dash across the frozen rivers. The chief\r\nhunting takes place in August and September, when the herds, each\r\nnumbering several thousand deer, return to the forests. They invariably\r\ncross the river at a particular spot, where a flat sandy bank enables\r\nthem to land with comparative ease; and here they close up their ranks,\r\nas it were, under the guidance of the stalwart veterans of the herd.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief pause of hesitation the herd plunge into the waters, and\r\nin a few minutes the surface of the river seems alive with swimming\r\nreindeer. Now is the hunter’s time; and out from his concealment in\r\nthe reedy creek he darts in his little boat, wounding as many animals\r\nas he can. While he and his comrades are thus engaged, they run some\r\nrisk of being capsized in the turmoil, for the bucks gallantly defend\r\nthemselves with horns, and teeth, and hind legs, while the roes usually\r\nattempt to spring with their fore feet upon the gunwale of the boat. If\r\nthe hunter should be overset, his sole chance of safety is to cling to\r\na strong animal, which will carry him securely across the stream. Such\r\nan accident, however, is of rare occurrence. A good hunter will kill a\r\nhundred reindeer, or even more, in half an hour. Meantime, the other\r\nboats seize the slaughtered animals, which become the property of their\r\ncrews; while those that are merely wounded and swim ashore belong to\r\nthe hunters, who, in the midst of the uproar, when all their strength\r\nis tasked to the uttermost, so aim their strokes as only to wound\r\nseverely the larger animals. The noise of the horns striking against\r\neach other, the “incarnadined” waters, the shouts of the hunters, the\r\ncries of pain, rage, and alarm of the struggling animals, all form a\r\nscene which, once seen, is not easily forgotten.\r\n\r\nWhile the men of Kolymsk are thus engaged during the brief summer-time\r\nin hunting, fishing, and haymaking, the women wander over the country,\r\nand climb the sides of the mountains, for the purpose of gathering\r\nedible roots, aromatic herbs, and various kinds of berries--though the\r\nlast do not ripen every year. The berry-plucking season at Kolymsk,\r\nlike the vintage in France or Italy, is a season of mirth, a holiday\r\ninterval in a hard and laborious life. The young women and girls form\r\nlarge parties, and spend whole days and nights in the open air. When\r\nthe berries are collected, cold water is poured over them, and they\r\nare preserved in a frozen state as an addition to the scanty winter\r\nfare. We are told that “social parties” are not unknown at Kolymsk,\r\nand probably afford as much or as little entertainment there as in\r\nmore favoured and more civilized communities. The staple luxury is a\r\ndeluge of weak tea--very weak, for the aromatic leaves which cheer but\r\nnot inebriate are very dear at Kolymsk; and as sugar is also a costly\r\narticle, every guest takes a lump of candy in his mouth, lets the tea\r\nwhich he sips flow by, and then replaces it upon the saucer. It would\r\nbe considered a breach of courtesy if he consumed the entire lump,\r\nwhich thus is made to do duty at more than one soiree. Next to tea, but\r\nnot less esteemed, the principal requisite for a Kolymsk entertainment\r\nis brandy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother important Siberian people are the Tungusi, who spread from\r\nthe basins of the Upper, Middle, and Lower Tunguska to the western\r\nshores of the Sea of Ochotsk, and from the Chinese frontiers and\r\nthe Baikal to the Polar Ocean. Their number does not exceed thirty\r\nthousand. According to their avocations, and the domestic animals which\r\nconstitute their wealth, they are known as the Reindeer, Horse, Dog,\r\nForest, and River Tungusi. Those who keep or rear horses and cattle\r\nare but a few; the majority depend on the reindeer. The condition of\r\nall is deplorably wretched. The Tungusi has no resource but fishing\r\nor hunting. When the rivers are frozen, he withdraws into the forest.\r\nHere his misery is so great and his need so extreme that he frequently\r\nbecomes a cannibal, and attacks the wives and children of his more\r\nfortunate countrymen. In happier circumstances he is remarkable for the\r\nreadiness of his wit, the vivacity of his manner, and the blithesome\r\ncarelessness of his disposition. It is asserted, however, that he is\r\nboth malignant and deceitful. He is vain; and loves to decorate his\r\nperson with strings and ornaments of glass beads, from his small Tartar\r\ncap to the tips of his shoes. When hunting the reindeer, or travelling\r\nthrough the forests, however, he puts on large water-tight boots, or\r\n_sari_, well greased with fat; and he carries, on these occasions,\r\na small axe, a kettle, a leathern wallet containing some dried fish,\r\nand a short gun, or a bow and a sling. He is always accompanied by his\r\nfaithful dog.\r\n\r\n“With the assistance of his long and narrow snow-shoes, he flies over\r\nthe dazzling plain; and protects his eyes, like the Jakut, with a\r\nnet made of black horse-hair. He never hesitates to attack the bear\r\nsingle-handed, and generally masters him. The nomad Tungusi naturally\r\nrequires a movable dwelling. His tent is covered with leather, or large\r\npieces of pliable bark, which are easily rolled up, and transported\r\nfrom place to place. The _jart_ of the sedentary Tungusi resembles\r\nthat of the Jakut, and is so small that it can be very quickly and\r\nthoroughly warmed by a fire kindled on the stone hearth in the centre.\r\nIn his food the Tungusi is by no means dainty. One of his favourite\r\ndishes consists of the contents of a reindeer’s stomach mixed with wild\r\nberries, and spread out in thin cakes on the rind of trees, to be dried\r\nin the air or in the sun. Those who have settled on the Wilnj and in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Nertschinsk likewise consume large quantities of\r\nbirch tea, which they boil with fat and berries into a thick porridge;\r\nand this unwholesome food adds, no doubt, to the yellowness of their\r\ncomplexion.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe shall now, and lastly, take a glance at the Tchuktche (or Tuski),\r\nwho inhabit the north-eastern point of Asia, with the ice-covered\r\nwaters of the Polar Sea on one side, and those of Behring Sea on\r\nthe other. Their land is but seldom visited; all, however, who have\r\nventured thither agree in describing it as one of the most melancholy\r\nregions of the earth. The soil is barren, and half-frozen, yielding\r\nno other vegetation than mosses and lichens, the vaccinium, and the\r\ndwarf birch and willow,--except in the low grounds, where the reedy\r\nmarshes are frequented in the summer by geese, and swans, and ducks,\r\nand wading-birds. The climate is so rigorous that one wonders man can\r\nmake up his mind to endure it. There is no summer earlier than the 20th\r\nof July; and on the 20th of August the shadow of winter comes upon the\r\nearth. Animal life, however, if not very varied, is abundant: walruses,\r\nsea-lions, and seals inhabit the coasts; and the reindeer, the wolf,\r\nthe argali, and the Arctic fox are found in the interior.\r\n\r\nThe Tchuktche are an enterprising people, and fond of independence.\r\nUnlike their neighbours, the Koriaks, they have always maintained\r\ntheir freedom against the encroachments of Russia. They are active and\r\nspirited traders. In skin-covered boats they cross Behring Straits,\r\nand barter furs and walrus-teeth with the natives of America. In\r\nlong caravans, their sledges drawn by reindeer, they repair to the\r\ngreat fair of Ostrownoje, and carry on a vigorous commerce with the\r\nRussian merchants. In their train follow sledges laden with supplies\r\nof lichen and moss for the reindeer, as in their wanderings, however\r\ncircuitous these may be, they are compelled to traverse broad spaces\r\nof stony desert, where even these abstemious animals can obtain no\r\nfood. As their movements are regulated by the necessities of their\r\nherds, they occupy five or six months in a journey which, in a straight\r\nline, would not exceed a thousand versts in length; they are almost\r\nalways migrating from place to place, yet, as they invariably carry\r\ntheir dwellings with them, they never leave home. A caravan generally\r\nconsists of fifty or sixty families; and as soon as one fair is at an\r\nend, they depart to make their preparations for the next.\r\n\r\nThe great staple of the trade at Ostrownoje is tobacco. To secure a\r\nsmall supply of the narcotic which forms the sole luxury of their\r\ndreary lives, the Eskimos of North America, extending from the Icy Cape\r\nto Bristol Bay, send their articles of barter from hand to hand as far\r\nas the Gwosdus Islands in Behring Strait, where the Tchuktche purchase\r\nthem with tobacco bought at Ostrownoje. Thus, in the icy regions of\r\nthe extreme north, tobacco is the source and support of considerable\r\ncommerce; and the narcotic weed which Raleigh and his contemporaries\r\nintroduced from America into Europe, and which from Europe made its way\r\ninto Asia, is exported from Asia for the use of American tribes.\r\n\r\nThe balance of trade, however, seems entirely against the latter.\r\nWe are told that the skins which a Tchuktche purchases of an Eskimo\r\nfor half a pood (eighteen pounds) of tobaccoleaves, he sells to the\r\nRussian for two poods (seventy-two pounds); and these skins, costing\r\nthe Russian about one hundred and sixty roubles, the latter sells at\r\nJakutsk for two hundred and sixty, and at St. Petersburg for upwards of\r\nfive hundred roubles.\r\n\r\nThe furs sold at Ostrownoje are chiefly those of stone foxes, black\r\nand silver-gray foxes, gluttons, lynxes, otters, beavers, and martens.\r\nOther products brought thither by the Tchuktche are bear-skins,\r\nwalrus-teeth, and thongs, sledge-runners (made of whale ribs), and\r\ndresses of reindeer-skin. The Russians, besides tobacco, dispose of\r\nkettles, axes, knives, guns, tea, and sugar.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA visit to the family of a Tchuktche chief is thus described by one of\r\nAdmiral Wrangell’s companions:--\r\n\r\nWe entered the outer tent, or _namet_, consisting of tanned\r\nreindeer-skins outstretched on a slender framework. An opening at the\r\ntop to give egress to the smoke, and a kettle on the hearth in the\r\ncentre, showed that antechamber and kitchen were here harmoniously\r\nblended into one. But where might be the inmates? Most probably in that\r\nlarge sack made of the finest skins of reindeer calves, which occupied,\r\nnear the kettle, the centre of the _namet_. To penetrate into this\r\n“sanctum sanctorum” of the Tchuktch household, we raised the loose\r\nflap which served as a door, crept on all fours through the opening,\r\ncautiously refastened the flap by tucking it under the floor-skin,\r\nand found ourselves in the _polog_--that is, the reception or\r\nwithdrawing-room. A snug box, no doubt, for a cold climate, but rather\r\nlow, as we were unable to stand upright in it; nor was it quite so\r\nwell ventilated as a sanitary commissioner would require, as it had\r\npositively no opening for light or air. A suffocating smoke met us\r\non entering: we rubbed our eyes; and when they had at length got\r\naccustomed to the pungent atmosphere, we perceived, by the gloomy light\r\nof a train-oil lamp, the worthy family sitting on the floor in a state\r\nof almost complete nudity. Without being in the least embarrassed,\r\nMadame Leütt and her daughter received us in their primitive costume;\r\nbut to show us that the Tchuktche knew how to receive company, and to\r\ndo honour to their guests, they immediately inserted strings of glass\r\nbeads in their hair.\r\n\r\nTheir hospitality equalled their politeness; for, instead of a cold\r\nreception, a hot dish of boiled reindeer flesh, copiously irrigated\r\nwith rancid train-oil by the experienced hand of the mistress of the\r\nhousehold, was soon after smoking before them. The culinary taste of\r\nthe Russians, however, could not appreciate this work of art, and the\r\nLeütt family were left to do justice to it unaided.\r\n\r\nThe Tchuktche are polygamous. Their women are regarded as slaves, but\r\nare not badly treated. Most of the Tchuktche have been baptized, but\r\nthey cling in secret to their heathen creed, and own the power of the\r\nshamans, or necromancers. They form two great divisions: the reindeer,\r\nor wandering Tchuktche, who call themselves Tennygk; and the stationary\r\nTchuktche, or Oukilon, who exhibit affinities with the Eskimos, and\r\nsubsist by hunting the whale, the walrus, and the seal. The Oukilon are\r\nsupposed to number 10,000, and the Tennygk about 20,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n                HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ARCTIC DISCOVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Henry VIII., Dr. Robert Thorne declared that “if he had\r\nfacultie to his will, the first thing he would understande, even to\r\nattempt, would be if our seas northwarde be navigable to the Pole or\r\nno.” And it is said that the king, at his instigation, “sent two fair\r\nships, well-manned and victualled, having in them divers cunning men,\r\nto seek strange regions; and so they set forth out of the Thames, the\r\n20th day of May, in the nineteenth year of his reign, which was the\r\nyear of our Lord 1527.” Of the details of this expedition, however, we\r\nhave no record, except that one of the vessels was wrecked on the coast\r\nof Newfoundland.\r\n\r\nIn 1536, a second Arctic voyage was undertaken by a London gentleman,\r\nnamed Hore, accompanied by thirty members of the Inns of Law, and\r\nabout the same number of adventurers of a lower estate. They reached\r\nNewfoundland, which, according to some authorities, was discovered by\r\nSebastian Cabot in 1496, and here they suffered terrible distress;\r\nin the extremity of their need being reduced to cannibalism. After\r\nthe deaths of a great portion of the crew, the survivors captured by\r\nsurprise a French vessel which had arrived on the coast, and navigated\r\nher in safety to England.\r\n\r\nBut the true history of Arctic Discovery dates, as Mr. Markham\r\nobserves, from the day when the veteran navigator, Sebastian Cabot,\r\nexplained to young Edward VI. the phenomena of the variation of the\r\nneedle. On the same day the aged sailor received a pension; and\r\nimmediately afterwards three discovery-ships were fitted out by\r\nthe Muscovy Company under his direction. Sir Hugh Willoughby was\r\nappointed to their command, with Richard Chancellor in the _Edward\r\nBonadventure_ as his second. The latter, soon after quitting\r\nEngland, was separated from the squadron, and sailing in a northerly\r\ndirection, gained at last a spacious harbour on the Muscovy coast. Sir\r\nHugh’s ship, and her companion, the _Bona Confidentia_, were cast\r\naway on a desolate part of the Lapland coast, at the mouth of the river\r\nArzina. They entered the river on September 18, 1563, and remained\r\nthere for a week; and “seeing the year far spent, and also very evil\r\nweather, as frost, snow, and hail, as though it had been the deep of\r\nwinter, they thought it best to winter there.” But as day followed day,\r\nand week followed week, in those grim solitudes of ice and snow, the\r\nbrave adventurers perished one by one; and many months afterwards their\r\nbleached bones were discovered by some Russian fishermen.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1556, Stephen Burrough, afterwards chief pilot of\r\nEngland, fitted out the “Search-thrift” pinnace, and sailed away for\r\nthe remote north. He discovered the strait leading into the sea of\r\nKara, between Novaia Zemlaia and the island Waigatz; but he made up\r\nhis mind to return, because, first, of the north winds, which blew\r\ncontinually; second, “the great and terrible abundance of ice which\r\nwe saw with our eyes;” and third, because the nights waxed dark. He\r\narrived at Archangel on September 11, wintered there, and returned to\r\nEngland in the following year.\r\n\r\nTwenty years later, on a bright May morning, Queen Elizabeth waved\r\na farewell to Martin Frobisher and his gallant company, as they\r\ndropped down the Thames in two small barks, the _Gabriel_ and\r\nthe _Michael_, each of thirty tons, together with a pinnace of\r\nten tons. They gained the shores of Friesland on the 11th of July;\r\nand sailing to the south-west, reached Labrador. Then, striking\r\nnorthward, they discovered “a great gut, bay, or passage,” which they\r\nnamed Frobisher Strait (lat. 63° 8’ N.), and fell into the error of\r\nsupposing that it connected the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific. Here\r\nthey came into contact with some Eskimos; and Frobisher describes them\r\nas “strange infidels, whose like was never seen, read, nor heard of\r\nbefore: with long black hair, broad faces and flat noses, and tawny\r\nin colour, wearing seal-skins, the women marked in the face with blue\r\nstreaks down the cheeks, and round about the eyes.”\r\n\r\nFrobisher’s discoveries produced so great an impression on the public\r\nmind, that in the following year he was placed at the head of a larger\r\nexpedition, in the hope that he would throw open to English enterprise\r\nthe wealth of “far Cathay.” About the end of May 1577, he sailed from\r\nGravesend with the _Ayde_ of one hundred tons, the _Gabriel_\r\nof thirty, and the _Michael_ of thirty, carrying crews of ninety\r\nmen in all, besides about thirty merchants, miners, refiners, and\r\nartisans. He returned in September with two hundred tons of what\r\nwas supposed to be gold ore, and met with a warm reception. It was\r\nconsidered almost certain that he had fallen in with some portion of\r\nthe Indian coast, and Queen Elizabeth, naming it _Meta Incognita_,\r\nresolved to establish there a colony. For this purpose, Frobisher\r\nwas dispatched with fifteen well-equipped ships, three of which were\r\nto remain for a twelvemonth at the new settlement, while the others,\r\ntaking on board a cargo of the precious ore, were to return to England.\r\n\r\nIn the third week of June Frobisher arrived at Friesland, of which he\r\ntook possession in the queen’s name. Steering for Frobisher Strait,\r\nhe found its entrance blocked up with colossal icebergs; and the bark\r\n_Dennis_, which carried the wooden houses and stores for the\r\ncolony, coming in collision with one of these, unfortunately sank.\r\nThen, in a great storm, the fleet was scattered far and wide,--some of\r\nthe vessels drifting out to sea, some being driven into the strait;\r\nand when most of them rejoined their admiral, it was found they had\r\nsuffered so severely that no help remained but to abandon the project\r\nof a colony. They collected fresh supplies of ore, however, and then\r\nmade their way back to England as best they could. Here they were met\r\nwith the unwelcome intelligence that the supposed gold ore contained no\r\ngold at all, and was, in truth, mere dross and refuse.\r\n\r\nThe dream of a northern passage to Cathay was not to be dissipated,\r\nhowever, by an occasional misadventure. Even a man of the keen\r\nintellect of Sir Humphrey Gilbert felt persuaded that through the\r\nnorthern seas lay the shortest route to the treasures of the East;\r\nand having obtained from Queen Elizabeth a patent authorizing him to\r\nundertake north-western discoveries, and to acquire possession of\r\nany lands not inhabited or colonized by Christian princes or their\r\nsubjects, he equipped, in 1583, with the help of his friends, a\r\nsquadron of five small ships, and sailed from England full of bright\r\nvisions and sanguine anticipations. On board his fleet were smiths, and\r\ncarpenters, and shipwrights, and masons, and refiners, and “mineral\r\nmen;” not to speak of one Stephen Parmenio, a learned Hungarian, who\r\nwas bound to chronicle in sonorous Latin all “gests and things worthy\r\nof remembrance.”\r\n\r\nSir Humphrey formed a settlement at Newfoundland; and then, embarking\r\non board the _Squirrel_, a little pinnace of ten tons burden,\r\nand taking with him the _Golden Hind_ and the _Delight_, he\r\nproceeded on a voyage of exploration. Unhappily, the _Delight_\r\nran ashore on the shoals near Sable Land, and all her crew except\r\ntwelve men, and all her stores, were lost. The disaster determined\r\nSir Humphrey to return to England; and his companions implored him\r\nto embark on board the _Golden Hind_, representing that the\r\n_Squirrel_ was unfit for so long a voyage. “I will not forsake,”\r\nreplied the chivalrous adventurer, “the brave and free companions with\r\nwhom I have undergone so many storms and perils.” Soon after passing\r\nthe Azores, they were overtaken by a terrible tempest, in which the\r\ntiny pinnace was tossed about by the waves like a straw. The _Golden\r\nHind_ kept as near her as the rolling billows permitted; and her\r\ncaptain has left on record that he could see Sir Humphrey sitting\r\ncalmly in the stern reading a book. He was heard to exclaim--“Courage,\r\nmy lads; we are as near heaven by sea as by land!” Then night came on,\r\nwith its shadows and its silence, and next morning it was perceived\r\nthat the pinnace and her gallant freight had gone to swell the sum of\r\nthe irrecoverable treasures of the deep.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE LOSS OF THE “SQUIRREL.”]\r\n\r\nBut neither Frobisher’s mishap nor Sir Humphrey Gilbert’s melancholy\r\nfate could check that current of English enterprise which had set\r\nin for the North. There was an irresistible attraction in these\r\nremote northern seas and distant mist-shrouded lands, with all their\r\npossibilities of wealth and glory; and Arctic Discovery had already\r\nbegun to exercise on the mind of the English people that singular\r\nfascination which the course of centuries has not weakened, which\r\nendures even to the present day. So, in 1585, Sir Adrian Gilbert\r\nand some other gentlemen of Devonshire raised funds sufficient to\r\nfit out a couple of vessels--the _Sunshine_ of fifty, and the\r\n_Moonshine_ of thirty-five tons--for the great work of discovery;\r\nand they gave the command to a veteran mariner and capable navigator,\r\nCaptain John Davis, a countryman, or county-man, of their own. Towards\r\nthe end of July he reached the west coast of Greenland, and its\r\ncheerless aspect induced him to christen it the “Land of Desolation.”\r\nHis intercourse with the Eskimos, however, was of the friendliest\r\ncharacter. Standing away to the north-west, he discovered and crossed\r\nthe strait which still bears his name; and to the headland on its\r\nwestern coast he gave the name of Cape Walsingham. Having thus opened\r\nup, though unwittingly, the great highway to the Polar Sea, he sailed\r\nfor England, where he arrived on the 20th of September.\r\n\r\nIn his second voyage, in 1586, when, in addition to the _Sunshine_\r\nand the _Moonshine_, he had with him the _Mermaid_ of one\r\nhundred and twenty tons, and the _North Star_ pinnace of ten, he\r\nretraced his route of the previous year. The _Sunshine_ and the\r\n_North Star_, however, he employed in cruising along the east\r\ncoast of Greenland; and they ascended, it is said, as high as lat. 80°\r\nN.\r\n\r\nDavis in his third voyage pushed further to the north, reaching as far\r\nas the bold promontory which he named Cape Sanderson. He also crossed\r\nthe great channel afterwards known as Hudson Bay.\r\n\r\nThe next Englishman who ventured into the frozen seas was one Captain\r\nWaymouth, in 1602; but he added nothing to the scanty information\r\nalready acquired. An Englishman, James Hall, was the chief pilot of an\r\nexpedition fitted out in 1605 by the King of Denmark, which explored\r\nsome portion of the Greenland coast. He made three successive voyages;\r\nbut while exhibiting his own courage and resolution, he contributed\r\nnothing to the stores of geographical knowledge.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe now arrive at a name which deservedly ranks among the foremost of\r\nArctic explorers--that of Henry Hudson. He contributed more to our\r\nacquaintance with the Polar seas than any one who had preceded him, and\r\nfew of his successors have surpassed him in the extent and thoroughness\r\nof his researches.\r\n\r\nHe first appears, says Mr. Markham, fitting out a little cock-boat for\r\nthe Muscovy Company, called the _Hopewell_ (of eighty tons), to\r\ndiscover a passage by the North Pole. On the 1st of May 1607 he sailed\r\nfrom Greenwich. “When we consider the means with which he was provided\r\nfor the achievement of this great discovery, we are astonished at the\r\nfearless audacity of the attempt. Here was a crew of twelve men and\r\na boy, in a wretched little craft of eighty tons, coolly talking of\r\nsailing right across the Pole to Japan, and actually making as careful\r\nand judicious a trial of the possibility of doing so as has ever been\r\neffected by the best equipped modern expeditions.... Imagine this\r\nbold seaman sailing from Gravesend, bound for the North Pole, in a\r\ncraft about the size of one of the smallest of modern collier brigs.\r\nWe can form a good idea of her general appearance, because three such\r\nvessels are delineated on the chart drawn by Hudson himself. The\r\n_Hopewell_ was more like an old Surat buggalow than anything else\r\nthat now sails the seas, with high stern, and low pointed bow; she had\r\nno head-sails on her bowsprit, but, to make up for this, the foremast\r\nwas stepped chock forward. There was a cabin under the high and narrow\r\npoop, where Hudson and his little son were accommodated; and the crew\r\nwere crowded forward.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SHIP OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.]\r\n\r\nHudson first sighted land beyond the Arctic Circle in lat. 70°. It was\r\nthe cold, grim coast of East Greenland. Three degrees further north\r\na chain of lofty peaks, all bare of snow, rose upon the horizon, and\r\nHudson’s men noted that the temperature daily increased in mildness.\r\nSteering to the north-east, the great navigator arrived off the shores\r\nof Spitzbergen, where some of his men landed and picked up various\r\nfragments of whalebone, horns of deer, walrus-teeth, and relics of\r\nother animals. To the north-west point of Spitzbergen he gave the name\r\nwhich it still bears--Hakluyt’s Headland. At one time he found himself\r\nas far north as 81°; and it seems probable that he discovered the Seven\r\nIslands: he remarked that the sea was in some places green, in others\r\nblue; and he says, “Our green sea we found to be freest from ice, and\r\nour azure-blue sea to be our icy sea;” an observation not confirmed by\r\nlater navigators. The greenness was probably due to the presence of\r\nminute organisms.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SCENERY OF JAN MAYEN.]\r\n\r\nHaving completed a survey of the west coast of Spitzbergen, he resolved\r\non sailing round the north end of Greenland, which he supposed to be\r\nan island, and returning to England by Davis Strait. With this view\r\nhe again examined the sea between Spitzbergen and Greenland, but from\r\nthe strong ice-blink along the northern horizon felt convinced that\r\nthere was no passage in that direction. After sighting Spitzbergen,\r\ntherefore, he determined to return to England; and on his homeward\r\nvoyage discovered an island in lat. 71° N., which he named Hudson\r\nSutches, and which has since been improperly named Jan Mayen. The\r\n_Hopewell_ arrived in the Thames on the 15th of September.\r\n\r\nThe results of this voyage, says Mr. Markham, were very important, both\r\nin a geographical and a commercial point of view. Hudson had discovered\r\na portion of the east coast of Greenland; he had examined the edge of\r\nthe ice between Greenland and Spitzbergen twice--in June and in the end\r\nof July; and he had sailed to the northward of Spitzbergen until he was\r\nstopped by the ice, reaching almost as high a latitude as Scoresby in\r\n1806, which was 81° 12′ 42″ N. Hudson’s highest latitude by observation\r\nwas 80° 23’, but he sailed for two more days in a north-easterly\r\ndirection. The practical consequence of his voyage was that his account\r\nof the quantities of whales and sea-horses in the Spitzbergen seas led\r\nto the establishment of a rich and prosperous fishery, which continued\r\nto flourish for two centuries.\r\n\r\nIn the following year Hudson made a second voyage, in the hope of\r\ndiscovering a north-eastern passage to China between Spitzbergen and\r\nNovaia Zemlaia. He exhibited his characteristic resolution, and forced\r\nhis way to the very gate of the unknown region, which is still closed\r\nagainst human enterprise by an impenetrable barrier of ice; but all his\r\nefforts proved in vain, and he returned to Gravesend on the 26th of\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\nIn 1610, in a vessel of fifty-five tons, he once more entered the Polar\r\nseas, and gained the extreme point of Labrador, which he named Cape\r\nWolstenholm. Here burst upon him the view of that magnificent sea which\r\nhas since been associated with his name; and there can be no doubt\r\nthat his enterprise would have anticipated the discoveries of later\r\nnavigators, but for the mutiny which broke out among his crew, and\r\neventually led to his being sent adrift, with nine faithful companions,\r\nin a small open boat. He was never again heard of.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe spirit of commercial enterprise and the love of maritime adventure\r\nwere still strong enough in England to induce the equipment of\r\nfurther expeditions. In 1612 sailed Captain Button,--who discovered\r\na stream, and named it Nelson River; where, at a later date, the\r\nHudson Bay Company planted their first settlement. Here he wintered.\r\nIn April 1613, on the breaking up of the ice, he resumed his work of\r\nexploration, and discovered, in lat. 65°, an island group, which he\r\nnamed Manuel, now known as Mansfield, Islands. Then he bore away for\r\nEngland, arriving in the Thames early in September.\r\n\r\nRobert Bylot and William Baffin undertook a voyage in 1615. The latter\r\nhad had some previous experience of Arctic navigation, which he turned\r\nto advantage in 1616, when he accompanied Bylot on a second expedition.\r\nTheir ship, the _Discovery_, of fifty-five tons, reached Cape\r\nHope Sanderson, the furthest point attained by Davis, on the 30th of\r\nMay; and after meeting with some obstruction from the ice, proceeded\r\nnorthwards to 72° 45’, where she dropped anchor for awhile among the\r\nWomen’s Islands. Baffin kept to the north until he found ice in 74°\r\n15’ N., and he then ascended Melville Bay, touching the head of the\r\ngreat basin now known by his name, and sailing down its western coast.\r\nHe arrived in Dover Roads on the 30th of August, after a brilliantly\r\nsuccessful voyage, which had opened up the principal north-west\r\nchannels into the Arctic Sea.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is necessary here to interpolate a few remarks in explanation of the\r\ndifficulties which beset the Baffin Bay route of Arctic exploration.\r\nGeographers assert, and the assertion seems confirmed by the experience\r\nof navigators, that a surface-current is constantly flowing down this\r\nbay, and carrying great fleets of icebergs and shoals of ice-floes into\r\nthe Atlantic from its southern channels--Lancaster, Jones, and Smith\r\nSounds. Hence, at the head of the bay there exists a considerable open\r\nand navigable expanse, which extends for some distance up Lancaster\r\nand Smith Sounds during the summer and early winter, and is known as\r\nthe “North Water.” But between this open expanse and Davis Strait lies\r\nan immense mass of ice, averaging from one hundred and seventy to two\r\nhundred miles in width, and blocking up the centre of Baffin Bay, so\r\nas to interrupt the approach to the north-west end. This is known as\r\nthe “middle pack,” and consists of some ancient floe-pieces of great\r\nthickness, which may have been brought down from a distant part of the\r\nArctic seas; of a wide extent of ice accumulated during each winter,\r\nabout six or eight feet in thickness; and of the grand and gigantic\r\nicebergs which are so characteristic a feature of the Melville Bay\r\nscenery. A very large quantity of this pack is destroyed in each\r\nsucceeding summer by the thaws, or by the swell and warm temperature of\r\nthe Atlantic as the ice drifts southward.\r\n\r\nIt is remarked of the Baffin Bay ice, that it is much lighter than\r\nthat found in the Spitzbergen seas. The latter often occurs in single\r\nsheets, solid, transparent, and from twenty to thirty, and even forty,\r\nfeet in thickness. In Baffin Bay the average thickness of the floes\r\ndoes not exceed five or six feet, and eight or ten feet is of very rare\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nFrom Baffin’s voyage, in 1616, until 1817, no attempt was made to force\r\nthis “middle pack” and enter the North Water; but now the voyage is\r\nmade every year, and three routes have been opened up. The first is\r\ncalled the “North-about Passage,” and lies along the Greenland coast;\r\nthe second, or “Middle Passage,” only possible late in the season, is\r\nby entering the drift-ice in the centre of the bay; and the third, or\r\n“Southern Passage,” also only possible late in the season, along the\r\nwest side of Baffin Bay. Once in the North Water, whichever route be\r\nattempted, all obstacles to an exploration of the unknown region may be\r\nconsidered at an end. From Cape York to Smith Sound the sea is always\r\nnavigable in the summer months.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that the great highways to the Pole were\r\ndiscovered by William Baffin.\r\n\r\nOur limits compel us to pass over the voyages of Stephen Bennet\r\n(1603–1610), Jonas Poole (1610–1613), and Captain Luke Fox (1631). In\r\n1631 the merchants of Bristol despatched Captain Thomas James, but he\r\nmade no additions to the discoveries of his predecessors. And then\r\nfor nearly two centuries England abandoned her efforts to open up a\r\ncommunication between the Atlantic and the Pacific.\r\n\r\nIn 1818, however, the question of the existence of a North-West\r\nPassage once more occupied the public mind; and the British Government\r\naccordingly fitted out an exploring expedition, the _Isabella_ and\r\nthe _Alexander_, under the command of Captain Ross and Lieutenant\r\nParry.\r\n\r\nThey sailed from England on the 18th of April, reached the southern\r\nedge of the Baffin Bay ice on the 2nd of July, and, after a detention\r\nof thirty-eight days, reached the North Water on August 8th. The capes\r\non each side of the mouth of Smith Sound, Ross named after his two\r\nships; and having accomplished this much, he affirmed that he saw land\r\nagainst the horizon at a distance of eight leagues, and then retraced\r\nhis course, and sailed for England.\r\n\r\nThe British Government, however, refused to be discouraged by the\r\nfailure of an expedition which had obviously been conducted with an\r\nentire absence of vigour and enterprise. They therefore equipped the\r\n_Hecla_ and the _Griper_, and gave the command to Lieutenant\r\nParry; who sailed from the Thames on the 5th of May 1819, and on the\r\n15th of June sighted Cape Farewell. Striking northward, up Davis Strait\r\nand Baffin Bay, he found himself checked by the ice-barrier in lat.\r\n73° N. A man of dauntless resolution, he came to the determination of\r\nforcing a passage at all hazards; and in seven days, by the exercise of\r\na strong will, great sagacity, and first-rate seamanship, he succeeded\r\nin carrying his ships through the pack of ice, which measured eighty\r\nmiles in breadth.\r\n\r\nHe was then able to enter Sir James Lancaster Sound; and up this\r\nnoble inlet he proceeded with a fair wind, hopeful of entering the\r\ngreat Polar Sea. But after advancing a considerable distance, he was\r\nonce more met by the frozen powers of the North, and this time he was\r\nforced to own himself vanquished. He accordingly returned towards the\r\nsouth, discovering Barrow Strait; and, more to the westward, an inlet\r\nwhich has since figured conspicuously in Arctic voyages--Wellington\r\nChannel. Bathurst Island he also added to the map; and afterwards he\r\ncame in sight of Melville Island. On the 4th of September he attained\r\nthe meridian of 110° W. long., and thus became entitled to the\r\nParliamentary grant of £5000. A convenient harbour in the vicinity was\r\nnamed the “Bay of the _Hecla_ and the _Griper_,” and here\r\nLieutenant Parry resolved upon passing the winter.\r\n\r\nIn the following spring he resumed his adventurous course, and\r\ncompleted a very careful survey of the shores of Baffin Sea; after\r\nwhich he repaired to England, and reached the Thames in safety, with\r\nhis crews in good health, and his ships in excellent condition, about\r\nthe middle of November 1820.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE “HECLA” AND “FURY” WINTERING AT WINTER ISLAND.]\r\n\r\nHaving done so much and so well, it was natural that Captain Parry\r\nshould again be selected for employment in the Arctic seas in the\r\nfollowing year. He hoisted his flag in his old ship, the _Hecla_,\r\nand was accompanied by the _Fury_; both vessels being equipped\r\nin the most liberal manner. He sailed from the Nore on the 8th of May\r\n1821; he returned to the Shetland Islands on the 10th of October 1823.\r\nIn the interval, a period of seven-and-twenty months, he discovered\r\nthe Duke of York Bay, the numerous inlets which break up the northern\r\ncoast-line of the American continent, Winter Island, the islands of\r\nAnatoak and Ooght, the Strait of the _Fury_ and _Hecla_,\r\nMelville Peninsula, and Cockburn Island. During their winter sojourn\r\non Winter Island, the English crews were surprised by a visit from a\r\nparty of Eskimos, whose settlement Captain Parry visited in his turn.\r\nHe found it an establishment of five huts, with canoes, sledges, dogs,\r\nand above sixty men, women, and children, as regularly, and, to all\r\nappearance, as permanently fixed as if they had occupied the same spot\r\nthe whole winter. “If the first view,” says Parry, “of the exterior of\r\nthis little village was such as to create astonishment, that feeling\r\nwas in no small degree heightened on accepting the invitation soon\r\ngiven us to enter these extraordinary houses, in the construction of\r\nwhich we observed that not a single material was used but snow and\r\nice. After creeping through two low passages, having each its arched\r\ndoorway, we came to a small circular apartment, of which the roof was\r\na perfect arched dome. From this three doorways, also arched, and of\r\nlarger dimensions than the outward ones, led into as many inhabited\r\napartments--one on each side, and the other facing us as we entered.\r\nThe interior of these presented a scene no less novel than interesting:\r\nthe women were seated on the beds at the sides of the huts, each having\r\nher little fireplace or lamp, with all her domestic utensils about her.\r\nThe children crept behind their mothers, and the dogs shrank past us in\r\ndismay. The construction of this inhabited part of the hut was similar\r\nto that of the outer apartment,--being a dome, formed by separate\r\nblocks of snow laid with great regularity and no small art, each being\r\ncut into the shape requisite to form a substantial arch, from seven to\r\neight feet high in the centre, and having no support whatever but what\r\nthis principle of building supplies. Sufficient light was admitted into\r\nthese curious edifices by a circular window of ice, neatly fitted into\r\nthe roof of each apartment.”\r\n\r\nIn 1824–25 Captain Parry undertook a third voyage, but with less than\r\nhis usual success. The _Fury_ was driven ashore by the pressure of\r\nthe pack-ice, and so damaged, that Parry found it needful to abandon\r\nher, and remove her crew and stores to the _Hecla_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE “FURY” ABANDONED BY PARRY--1824.]\r\n\r\nSir John Parry’s fourth and last expedition, in 1827, was characterized\r\nby his bold attempt to cross the icy sea in light boats and sledges;\r\nresorting to the former when his progress was interrupted by pools of\r\nwater, and to the latter in traversing the unbroken surface of the\r\nice-fields. He was soon compelled, however, to abandon the sledges, on\r\naccount of the hummocks and irregularities of the ice.\r\n\r\nWe agree with Mr. Cooley, that voluntarily to undertake the toil and\r\nbrave the danger of such an expedition, required a zeal little short of\r\nenthusiasm. When the travellers reached a water-way, they were obliged\r\nto launch their boats and embark. On reaching the opposite side, their\r\nboats were then to be dragged, frequently up steep and perilous cliffs,\r\ntheir lading being first removed. By this laborious process, persevered\r\nin with little intermission, they contrived to accomplish eight miles\r\nin five days. They travelled only during the night, by which means they\r\nwere less incommoded with snow-blindness; they found the ice more firm\r\nand consistent; and had the great advantage of lying down to sleep\r\nduring the warmer portion of the twenty-four hours. Shortly after\r\nsunset they took their breakfast; then they laboured for a few hours\r\nbefore taking their principal meal. A little after midnight, towards\r\nsunrise, they halted as if for the night, smoked their pipes, looked\r\nover the icy desert in the direction in which the journey was to be\r\nresumed; and then, wrapping themselves in their furs, lay down to rest.\r\nAdvancing as far north as 82° 40’, they were then compelled by the\r\ndrifting of the snow-fields to retrace their steps. They regained their\r\nships on the 21st of August, and sailed for England.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe must now go back a few years. In May 1819, an overland expedition\r\nwas despatched to ascertain the exact position of the Coppermine River,\r\nto descend it to its mouth, and to explore the coast of the Arctic\r\nSea on either hand. The command was given to Lieutenant Franklin, who\r\nwas accompanied by Dr. Richardson the naturalist, by Messrs. Hood and\r\nBack, two English midshipmen, and two picked seamen. The expedition was\r\nspread over a period of two years and a half, and the narrative of what\r\nwas accomplished and endured by its members reads like a romance. They\r\nreached the mouth of the Coppermine, and then launched their little\r\nbarks on the chill waters of the Polar Sea. With much perseverance, and\r\nafter encountering some serious obstacles, they made their way along\r\nits shores in a westerly direction as far as Point Turnagain, in lat.\r\n68° 30’ N. Between this headland on the east, and Cape Barrow on the\r\nwest, opens a deep gulf, stretching inland as far as the Arctic Circle,\r\nFranklin named it George the Fourth’s Coronation Gulf; and describes it\r\nas studded with numerous islands, and indented with sounds affording\r\nexcellent harbours, all of them supplied with small rivers of fresh\r\nwater, abounding with salmon, trout, and other fish.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPassing over Franklin’s after-labours in the great cause of Arctic\r\nDiscovery, labours which secured him the well-merited reward of\r\nknighthood, we come to that last voyage, which helped, as we shall see,\r\nto solve the problem of a North-West Passage, but was the cause of one\r\nof the saddest chapters in the history of Maritime Enterprise.\r\n\r\nIt was in the spring of 1845 that Sir John Franklin, in command of\r\nthe _Erebus_ and the _Terror_, with Captain Crozier, an experienced\r\nArctic navigator, as his lieutenant, and at the head of one hundred\r\nand thirty-seven picked seamen, brave, resolute, and hardy, once more\r\nsailed for the Polar waters.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of June he left the Orkneys, and a month later arrived in\r\nBaffin Bay. About the end of July some whaling-ships in Melville Bay\r\nsaw the _Erebus_ and _Terror_ contending gallantly with the\r\nice which impeded their progress to Lancaster Sound. On the evening of\r\nthe 26th the ice opened up, and the two discovery-ships sailed away\r\ninto the north-western seas.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo years passed, and no news reached England of Franklin and his\r\ncompanions. As day succeeded day, and week followed week, and still no\r\ntidings came, men grew anxious, and then alarmed; “expectation darkened\r\ninto anxiety, anxiety into dread.” At last, it was determined to\r\ninstitute a search for the missing heroes. An expedition was sent out\r\nunder Sir James Ross; another under Sir John Richardson; but neither\r\nobtained any information. By many all hope was then abandoned; and\r\nthe fate of Franklin was regarded as one of those mysteries which the\r\nhistorian in vain attempts to unravel. He and his men had perished; of\r\n_that_ there could be no reasonable doubt. Yet a few were sanguine\r\nenough to believe that they had taken refuge among the Eskimos, or\r\nwere dragging out a weary existence in some remote wilderness, in\r\nexpectation of help from home. Franklin’s brave and noble wife was\r\none of those who, whatever they feared or hoped, were, at all events,\r\ndetermined not to rest until some accurate information had been gained.\r\nAnd round her gathered the most eminent scientific men of the day,\r\nwhose influence combined with the general sympathy of the people to\r\nencourage the Government in a further effort.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1850 that the first clue to the position of the _Erebus_\r\nand _Terror_ was secured in Beechey Island, through the accidental\r\ndetention there of the searching expeditions of Captains Austin and\r\nPenny.\r\n\r\nThey were bound for Melville Island, but on reaching the entrance of\r\nWellington Channel (August 1850), were met by such immense fields of\r\nice sweeping down it and out of Barrow Strait, that they were glad to\r\nseek shelter in a great bay at the eastern end of the channel,--a bay\r\nalmost bisected, as it were, by Beechey Island. On the 23rd, a boat\r\nfrom Captain Ommaney’s ship, the _Assistance_, happened to land\r\non one of the extreme points of the bay; and the crew, in the course\r\nof their wanderings, were not a little surprised to discover traces\r\nof a former visit from Europeans. Under the lofty cliff of Cape Riley\r\nthey came upon the groundwork of a tent, scraps of canvas and rope, a\r\nquantity of birds’ bones and feathers, and a long-handled rake which,\r\napparently, had been used for collecting the rich rare weeds that cover\r\nthe bottom of the Arctic waters.\r\n\r\nThat Europeans had been encamped there, was certain, but not a name\r\nor record associated the remains with Franklin’s expedition. News of\r\nthe discovery, however, reached Captain Penny, an Aberdeen seaman, who\r\nhad been employed by the British Admiralty as leader of a separate\r\nexpedition; and in conjunction with Lieutenant de Haven, of the United\r\nStates Navy, who was in command of the expedition liberally equipped\r\nby Mr. Grinnell, of New York, he resolved to examine the east coast of\r\nWellington Channel with minute care, in the belief that some memorials\r\nof Franklin would thus be discovered.\r\n\r\nFrom a point called Cape Spenser, the Americans, on foot, pursued the\r\ntrail of a sledge up the east side of Wellington Channel, until, at\r\none day’s journey beyond Cape Innis, it suddenly ceased, as if the\r\nparty had there turned back again. A bottle and a piece of _The\r\nTimes_ newspaper were the only relics which fell into the hands of\r\nthe searchers. Meantime, Captain Penny had anchored his ships under\r\nthe western point of Beechey Island, and despatched a boat to take up\r\nthe clue at Cape Riley, and follow it to the eastward, in the event of\r\nthe traces being those of a party retreating from the ships, supposing\r\nthem to have been ice-bound in the north-west, to Baffin Bay. This\r\nboat-party eventually returned unsuccessful; but, one afternoon, some\r\nmen belonging to the _Lady Franklin_ asked leave, and obtained\r\nit, for the purpose of a ramble over Beechey Island. They sauntered\r\nalong towards the low projecting portion of the island which extends\r\nnorthward, choosing a convenient spot to cross the huge ridges of\r\nice which lay piled up along the beach; they were seen to mount the\r\nacclivity or backbone of the point. In a minute afterwards their\r\nfriends on board the ships (says Admiral Sherard Osborn) saw the party\r\nrush simultaneously towards a dark object, round which they collected,\r\nwith signs of great excitement. Presently one ran hither, one thither.\r\nFeverish with anxiety, those on board knew immediately that some fresh\r\ntraces had been found, and a general sortie took place to Beechey\r\nIsland. “Eh, sir,” said a gallant Scotch mariner, when relating the\r\ndiscovery--“eh, sir, my heart was in my mouth, and I didna ken I could\r\nrin so fast afore.”\r\n\r\nAnd what had been found?\r\n\r\nA cairn, of a pyramidal form, which had evidently been constructed\r\nwith much care. The base consisted of a series of preserved-meat\r\ntins, filled with gravel and sand; and more tins were so arranged as\r\nto taper gradually upwards to the summit of the cairn, in which was\r\nplanted the fragment of a broken boarding-pike. To all appearance it\r\nhad been purposely raised for the reception of some documental record,\r\nyet nothing could be found in or about the spot, in spite of the most\r\npersevering efforts. But presently looking along the northern slope\r\nof the island, other strange objects caught the eye. Another rush of\r\nanxious excited beings, and they stood before three graves; and many\r\nof them brushed away the unwonted tear as they read upon their humble\r\ntablets the words _Erebus_ and _Terror_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCaptain Austin followed up Captain Penny in his explorations of the\r\nArctic wastes, but no further information was obtained of Franklin’s\r\nmovements. It was impossible to determine whether on his way home he\r\nhad perished in Baffin Bay; whether he had struck to the north-west\r\nby Wellington Channel; or whether he was haply imprisoned in Melville\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have no space, nor is it necessary, to dwell on the records of the\r\nvarious searching expeditions fitted out by the Government, or by\r\nLady Franklin and her friends. It must be noted, however, that one of\r\nthese, led by Captain (afterwards Sir) Robert M’Clure, succeeded in\r\naccomplishing the enterprise in which Franklin perished, and, entering\r\nthe Northern Ocean by Behring Strait, actually forced its way, through\r\nsnow and ice, into the Atlantic. The North-West Passage, so long\r\nsought, was thus discovered; but the discovery, though interesting\r\nand valuable from a geographical point of view, was followed by no\r\ncommercial results. In truth, it proved that the route along the\r\nnorth-west of the American Continent could never be practicable for\r\nordinary vessels.\r\n\r\nIt may be asserted that nearly all men had abandoned hope and\r\nexpectation of ascertaining any exact particulars of the fate of\r\nFranklin and his followers, when, towards the close of the autumn of\r\n1854, Dr. Rae, a well-known traveller and Arctic explorer, suddenly\r\nappeared in England, bringing with him the most curious evidence of\r\nthe disasters which had overwhelmed a party that had evidently been\r\ntravelling from the ice-bound _Erebus_ and _Terror_ towards the Great\r\nFish River. Dr. Rae had ascertained from some Eskimos with whom he\r\nhad been travelling that this party numbered forty persons, and that\r\nall had died of starvation four years prior to Dr. Rae’s visit. The\r\nunfortunate “white men” had been first seen on King William’s Land;\r\nlater in the same year their dead bodies had been observed near or\r\nabout the mouth of the Great Fish River (1850). Dr. Rae brought home\r\nnumerous pieces of silver plate obtained from the Eskimos, which were\r\nmarked with the names of officers of the two ships. Lady Franklin\r\nwas encouraged by this intelligence to urge upon the Government the\r\npropriety of despatching an expedition to the points indicated by\r\nthe Eskimos; but the Government contented themselves with applying\r\nto the Hudson Bay Company. The result was an overland expedition in\r\n1855 to the mouth of the Great Fish River, by Mr. Anderson, one of the\r\nCompany’s chief officers. He had no boat with him capable of reaching\r\nKing William’s Land, though it was only sixty miles distant from the\r\npoint he attained, nor was he accompanied by an Eskimo interpreter. He\r\nascertained, however, that only a portion of the officers and men of\r\nthe _Erebus_ and _Terror_ had reached the Great Fish River--some forty\r\nof them, very possibly, as Dr. Rae had been informed; these forty, with\r\nthe three graves upon Beechey Island, still leaving ninety-five persons\r\nunaccounted for.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLady Franklin and her friends continued to press upon Government\r\nthe need for further inquiry; but finding the responsible ministers\r\nunwilling to interfere in what they had come to consider a hopeless\r\nenterprise, they contrived, with some help from the public, to\r\npurchase and fit out a strongly-built screw-schooner, of which Captain\r\nM’Clintock volunteered to take the command.\r\n\r\nHe sailed from England in the summer of 1857; reached Melville Bay\r\nin safety, but was then held fast by the floating ice. The winter,\r\nhowever, came and went without any injury to him and his gallant band;\r\nand on the 27th of July 1858, the _Fox_ stretched across to\r\nLancaster Sound. On the 11th of August she arrived at Beechey Island,\r\nand replenished her diminished stores from the depôts left there by\r\nprevious expeditions. Then she pushed to the westward, past Cape Hotham\r\nand Griffith Island, southward through Sir Robert Peel Channel, and so\r\ninto Prince Regent Inlet. Having arrived off the eastern entrance of\r\nBellot Strait, she found it blocked up by a wall of ice, and from the\r\n20th of August to the 6th of September she watched for an opportunity\r\nof breaking through it. On the 6th she made the passage, but only to\r\nfind the other end obstructed by an impassable ice-barrier; and, after\r\nfive fruitless attempts, her captain brought her to anchor for the\r\nwinter in Port Kennedy, on the northern side of the strait.\r\n\r\nWhen the new year opened, M’Clintock resolved on undertaking sledge\r\nexcursions in various directions, with the view of obtaining some\r\ninformation of Franklin and his expedition. In one of them, at Cape\r\nVictoria, on the west coast of Boothia (lat. 69° 50’ N., long. 96°\r\nW.), he ascertained from the natives that, several years previously, a\r\nship had been wrecked off the northern shores of King William’s Land;\r\nthat all her crew landed safely, and set off on a journey to the Great\r\nFish River, where they died. Again: in April, falling in with the same\r\nparty of Eskimos, they learned further, that besides the ship which had\r\nsunk in deep water, another had been driven ashore by the ice. Captain\r\nM’Clintock thereupon crossed to Montreal Island, travelled round the\r\nestuary of the Great Fish River, and visited Point Ogle and Barrow\r\nIsland. On May 7, he fell in with an old Eskimo woman, who told him\r\nthat many of the white men dropped by the way as they made towards the\r\nGreat Fish River; that some were buried, and some were not. Proceeding\r\nin what he conceived to have been the route of the retreating crews, he\r\ndiscovered, near Point Herschel, a bleached skeleton; evidently that of\r\none who had fallen behind the main body, from weakness and fatigue, and\r\nhad died where he had fallen.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DISCOVERY OF THE CAIRN CONTAINING SIR JOHN\r\n  FRANKLIN’S PAPERS.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: RELICS OF THE FRANKLIN EXPEDITION BROUGHT BACK TO\r\n  ENGLAND.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Lieutenant Hobson, who had started with another sledging\r\nparty, had made the important discovery of a record, giving a brief\r\naccount of the Franklin expedition up to the time when the ships were\r\nlost. It was found within a cairn constructed on Point Victory, and it\r\nset forth the following particulars:--\r\n\r\nThe _Erebus_ and _Terror_ spent their first winter at Beechey\r\nIsland, in the spot discovered by Penny and Austin’s expedition; but\r\nthey had previously explored Wellington Channel as far as 73° N.,\r\nand passed down again into Barrow Strait, between Cornwallis and\r\nBathurst Land. In 1846 the two ships seem to have sailed through Peel\r\nChannel, until caught in the ice off King William’s Land, on the\r\n12th of September. In May 1847, Lieutenant Graham Gore and Mr. des\r\nVœux landed, and erected a cairn a few miles south of Point Victory,\r\nand deposited in it a document which stated that, on that day, all\r\nwere well, with Sir J. Franklin in command. Within a month, however,\r\nthat illustrious navigator died (June 11), and thus was spared the\r\nterrible trials which afflicted his followers. The ice did not move,\r\nand the winter of 1847–48 closed in upon them. It proved fatal to nine\r\nofficers and fifteen men. On April 22, 1848, the two ships, which had\r\nbeen imprisoned for upwards of nineteen months, were deserted, and the\r\nofficers and crews, one hundred and five in number, under the command\r\nof Captains Crozier and Fitzjames, started for the Great Fish River.\r\n\r\nAt the cairn and all about it lay a great quantity of clothing and\r\nother articles, which the sufferers had found from experience of three\r\ndays to be a heavier weight than their enfeebled strength was able to\r\ndrag.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DISCOVERY OF ONE OF THE BOATS OF THE FRANKLIN\r\n  EXPEDITION.]\r\n\r\nFrom this point to a spot about midway between Point Victory and Point\r\nHerschel nothing of much importance was discovered, and the skeletons\r\nas well as relics were deeply embedded in snow. At this midway station,\r\nhowever, the top of a piece of wood projecting out of the snow was seen\r\nby Lieutenant Hobson, and on digging round it a boat was discovered. It\r\nstood on a very heavy sledge, and within it were a couple of skeletons.\r\nThe one in the bottom of the stern-sheets was covered with a great\r\nquantity of thrown-off clothing; the other, in the bows, seemed to have\r\nbeen that of some poor fellow who had crept there to look out, and in\r\nthat position fallen into his last sleep. A couple of guns, loaded and\r\nready cocked, stood upright to hand, as it they had been prepared for\r\nuse against wild animals. Around this boat was another accumulation of\r\ncast-off articles; and it was the belief of M’Clintock that the party\r\nin charge of her were returning to the ships, as it they discovered\r\ntheir strength unequal to the terrible journey before them. It may\r\nbe assumed, however, that the stronger portion of the crews still\r\npushed on with another boat, and that some reached Montreal Island and\r\nascended the Great Fish River.\r\n\r\nThe point, says Sherard Osborn, at which the fatal imprisonment of the\r\n_Erebus_ and _Terror_ in 1846 took place, was only ninety\r\nmiles from the spot reached by Dease and Simpson in their boats in\r\n1838–39, coming from the east. Ninety miles more of open water, and\r\nFranklin and his gallant crew would have not only won the prize they\r\nsought, but reached their homes to wear their well-earned honours. “It\r\nwas not to be so. Let us bow in humility and awe to the inscrutable\r\ndecrees of that Providence who ruled it otherwise. They were to\r\ndiscover the great highway between the Pacific and the Atlantic. It\r\nwas given them to win for their country a discovery for which she had\r\nrisked her sons and lavishly spent her wealth through many centuries;\r\nbut they were to die in accomplishing their last great earthly task:\r\nand, still more strange, but for the energy and devotion of the wife\r\nof their chief and leader, it would in all probability never have been\r\nknown that they were indeed the _First Discoverers of the North-West\r\nPassage_.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have thought it for the convenience of our readers to set before\r\nthem an uninterrupted narrative of the exertions made to ascertain the\r\nfate of Franklin and his companions by English seamen under English\r\ninfluence; but we must now return to 1853, to chronicle the American\r\nexpedition under Dr. Kane--which did not, indeed, succeed in its\r\nprimary object, but made some remarkable additions to our knowledge of\r\nthe Polar Regions.\r\n\r\nDr. Elisha Kane sailed from Boston in 1853, in command of the\r\n_Advance_, with a crew of seventeen officers and men, to whom two\r\nGreenlanders were subsequently added.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of August he passed the two great headlands which guard\r\nthe entrance of Smith Sound,--Cape Isabella and Cape Alexander,\r\ndiscovered and named in the preceding year by Captain Inglefield,--and\r\nafter a voyage of equal difficulty and danger reached Rensselaer Bay\r\non the east coast of the sound, where he passed the winter. A few\r\nextracts from his diary will show under what conditions, and in what\r\ncircumstances, Kane and his followers passed the long and dreary winter\r\nmonths:--\r\n\r\n“_October 28th._--The moon has reached her greatest northern\r\ndeclination of about 25° 35’. She is a glorious object; sweeping around\r\nthe heavens, at the lowest part of her curve, she is still 14° above\r\nthe horizon. For eight days she has been making her circuit with nearly\r\nunvarying brightness. It is one of those sparkling nights that bring\r\nback the memory of sleigh-bells and songs, and glad communings of\r\nhearts in lands that are far away.\r\n\r\n“_November 7th._--The darkness is coming on with insidious\r\nsteadiness, and its advances can only be perceived by comparing one\r\nday with its fellow of some time back. We still read the thermometer\r\nat noonday without a light, and the black masses of the hills are\r\nplain for about five hours, with their glaring patches of snow; but\r\nall the rest is darkness. The stars of the sixth magnitude shine out\r\nat noonday. Except upon the island of Spitzbergen, which has the\r\nadvantages of an insular climate, and tempered by ocean-currents,\r\nno Christians have wintered in so high a latitude as this. They are\r\nRussian sailors who made the encounter there--men inured to hardships\r\nand cold. Our darkness has ninety days to run before we shall get back\r\nagain even to the contested twilight of to-day. Altogether our winter\r\nwill have been sunless for one hundred and forty days.\r\n\r\n“_December 15th._--We have lost the last vestige of our mid-day\r\ntwilight. We cannot see print, and hardly paper; the finger’s cannot\r\nbe counted a foot from the eyes. Noonday and midnight are alike;\r\nand, except a vague glimmer in the sky that seems to define the hill\r\noutlines to the south, we have nothing to tell us that this Arctic\r\nworld of ours has a sun. In the darkness, and consequent inaction, it\r\nis almost in vain that we seek to create topics of thought, and, by a\r\nforced excitement, to ward off the encroachments of disease.”\r\n\r\nBut in due time the long Arctic night passed away, and the season came\r\nround for undertaking the sledge journeys which were the main object\r\nof the expedition. But Dr. Kane was then met by a new difficulty. Out\r\nof the nine splendid Newfoundland and thirty-five Eskimo dogs which he\r\nhad originally possessed, only six had survived a peculiar malady that\r\nhad seized them during the winter; and though some fresh purchases were\r\nmade from the Eskimos who visited Rensselaer Harbour early in April,\r\nhis means of transport remained wholly inadequate.\r\n\r\nKane, moreover, who though strong of heart was weak of body, had\r\nsuffered much from the rigour of the climate, and was in a sadly\r\nfeeble condition when, on the 25th of April 1854, he started on his\r\nnorthward journey. He found the Greenland coast, as he ascended Kane\r\nSea, full of romantic surprises; the cliffs rising to a height of ten\r\nhundred and eleven hundred feet, and presenting the boldest and most\r\nfantastic outlines. This character is continued as far as the Great\r\nHumboldt Glacier. The coast is indented by four great bays, all of them\r\ncommunicating with deep gorges, which are watered by streams from the\r\ninterior ice-fields. The mean height of the table-land, till it reaches\r\nthe bed of the Great Glacier, Dr. Kane estimated, in round numbers, at\r\n900 feet; its tallest summit near the water at 1300, and the rise of\r\nthe background above the general level at 600 more. The face of this\r\nstupendous ice-mass, as it defined the coast, was everywhere an abrupt\r\nand threatening precipice, only broken by clefts and deep ravines,\r\ngiving breadth and interest to its wild expression.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE “THREE BROTHER TURRETS.”]\r\n\r\nDr. Kane informs us that the most picturesque portion of the coast\r\noccurs in the neighbourhood of Dallas Bay. Here the red sandstones\r\ncontrast very favourably with the blank whiteness, and associate the\r\nwarm colours of more southern lands with the cold tints of the Arctic\r\nscenery. The seasons have acted on the different layers of the cliff so\r\nas to give them all the appearance of jointed masonry, and the narrow\r\nstratum of greenstone at the top surmounts them with boldly-designed\r\nbattlements. To one of these “interesting freaks of Nature” Kane gave\r\nthe name of the “Three Brother Turrets.” The crumbled ruin at the foot\r\nof the coast-wall led up, like an artificial causeway, to a ravine that\r\nblazed at noonday with the glow of the southern sun, when everywhere\r\nelse the rock lay in blackest shadow. Just at the edge of this lane\r\nof light rose the semblance of a castle, flanked with triple towers,\r\ncompletely isolated and defined. These were the Three Turrets.\r\n\r\nStill further to the north, a solitary cliff of greenstone, marked by\r\nthe slaty limestone that once encased it, sprang from a mass of broken\r\nsandstone, like the rough-hewn rampart of an ancient city. At its\r\nnorthern extremity, on the brink of a deep ravine, wrought out among\r\nthe ruin, stood a solitary column, or minaret-tower, the pedestal of\r\nwhich was not less than 280 feet in height, while the shaft was fully\r\n480 feet. Dr. Kane associated this remarkable beacon with the name of\r\nthe poet Tennyson.\r\n\r\nDr. Kane continued his advance, and on the 4th of May approached the\r\nGreat Glacier. This progress, however, was dearly earned. Owing to the\r\nexcessive cold and labour, most of his party suffered from painful\r\nprostration; three were attacked with snow-blindness; and all were\r\ntroubled with dropsical swellings. Off Cape Kent, while taking an\r\nobservation for latitude, Kane himself was seized with a sudden pain,\r\nand fainted. His limbs became rigid. He was strapped upon the sledge,\r\nand insisted that the march should be continued. But, on the 5th, he\r\ngrew delirious, and fainting every time that he was taken from the tent\r\nto the sledge, he succumbed entirely.\r\n\r\n“My comrades,” writes this heroic man, than whom no braver or more\r\nresolute spirit ever ventured into the dreary Northern wilds, “would\r\nkindly persuade me that, even had I continued sound, we could not have\r\nproceeded on our journey. The snows were very heavy, and increasing as\r\nwe went; some of the drifts perfectly impassable, and the level floes\r\noften four feet deep in yielding snow. The scurvy had already broken\r\nout among the men, with symptoms like my own; and Morton, our strongest\r\nman, was beginning to give way. It is the reverse of comfort to me that\r\nthey shared my weakness. All that I should remember with pleasurable\r\nfeeling is, that to five brave men, themselves scarcely able to travel,\r\nI owe my preservation.”\r\n\r\nThey carried him back to the brig at Rensselaer Harbour, and for\r\nseveral days he lay fluctuating between life and death. As the summer\r\ncame on, however, his health slowly improved; and though unable to\r\nundertake any sledge excursions in person, he organized a series of\r\nexpeditions in which his stronger companions took part. Dr. Hayes\r\ncrossed the strait in a north-easterly direction, reached the opposite\r\ncoast of Grinnell Land, where the cliffs varied from 1200 to 2000 feet\r\nin height, and surveyed it as far as Cape Fraser, in lat. 79° 45’.\r\n\r\nHe returned on June 1st, and, a few days later, Morton departed to\r\nsurvey the Greenland shore beyond the Humboldt Glacier. His journey was\r\na difficult one, for the obstacles offered by the ice hummocks were\r\nsometimes almost insurmountable, and the ice-field was intersected by\r\nchasms and water-lanes frequently four feet in width. After skirting\r\nthe coast of what is now known as Morris Bay, Morton’s party came\r\nupon easier ground; and presently a long low country opened on the\r\nland-ice, a wide plain between large headlands, with rolling hills\r\nthrough it. A flock of brent geese came down this valley, with a whirr\r\nof wings, and ducks were seen in crowds upon the open water. Eiders\r\nand dove-kies also made their appearance; and tern were very numerous,\r\nand exceedingly tame. Flying high overhead, their notes echoing\r\nfrom the rocks, were large white birds, which Morton supposed to be\r\nburgomasters. There were also ivory gulls and mollemokes; the former\r\nflying very high, and the latter winging their way far out to sea.\r\n\r\nThe channel (Kennedy Channel) was here unobstructed by ice, and its\r\nwaves rolled freely and noisily on the shore. Along its verdant margin\r\nMorton proceeded warily, and on the 26th of June, 1854, reached the\r\nstriking headland of Cape Constitution, about 2000 feet in height. Its\r\nbase was washed by a tremendous surf, through which it was impossible\r\nto pass--the _ne plus ultra_, as it seemed, of human enterprise.\r\nClimbing from rock to rock, he contrived to reach an elevation of 300\r\nfeet; from which he was able to trace the outline of the coast for\r\nfifty miles to the north. In the distance rose a range of mountains,\r\nvery lofty, and rounded at their summits. To the north-west might be\r\nseen a bare peak, striated vertically with protruding ridges, and\r\nsoaring to an altitude of between 2500 and 3000 feet. This peak, the\r\nmost remote northern land then known upon the globe, was named after\r\nthe great pioneer of Arctic travel, Sir Edward Parry.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MORTON ON THE SHORE OF THE SUPPOSED POLAR OCEAN.]\r\n\r\nThe range (Victoria and Albert Mountains) with which it was connected\r\nwas much higher, Morton thought, than any they had seen on the southern\r\nor Greenland side of the bay. The summits were generally rounded,\r\nresembling a succession of sugar-loaves and stacked cannonballs\r\ndeclining slowly in the perspective.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll the sledge-parties were now once more aboard the brig, and the\r\nseason of Arctic travel had ended. The short summer was rapidly wearing\r\naway, and yet the ice remained a rigid and impenetrable barrier. It was\r\nevident that the ship could not be liberated, and Kane found himself\r\ncompelled to decide between two equally dismal alternatives,--the\r\nabandonment of the ship, or another winter among the Polar snows.\r\nFor himself, he resolved to remain; but to those who were willing to\r\nventure on the attempt to reach the Danish settlement at Upernavik,\r\nhe left the choice open. Out of the seventeen survivors of the party,\r\neight, like Dr. Kane, decided to stand by the brig; the others, to push\r\nsouthward to Upernavik. These were provided with all the provisions and\r\nappliances that could be spared, and took their departure on Monday,\r\nAugust 28th; carrying with them a written assurance of a brother’s\r\nwelcome should they be driven back--an assurance amply redeemed when\r\nsevere trials had prepared them to share again the fortunes of their\r\ncommander.\r\n\r\nDr. Kane confronted the winter with equal sagacity and resolution. He\r\nhad carefully studied the Eskimos, and concluded that their form of\r\nhabitation and peculiarities of diet, without their unthrift and filth,\r\nwere the safest that could be adopted. He turned the brig, therefore,\r\ninto a kind of _igloë_, or hut. The quarter-deck was well padded\r\nwith moss and turf, and the cabin below, a space some eighteen feet\r\nsquare, was enclosed and packed from floor to ceiling with inner walls\r\nof the same material. The floor itself was carefully calked with\r\nplaster of Paris and common paste, and covered two inches deep with\r\nManilla oakum and a canvas carpet. The entrance was from the hold by a\r\nlow, moss-lined tunnel, the _tossut_ of the native huts, with as\r\nmany doors and curtains to close it up as ingenuity could devise. This\r\nwas their sitting-room, dining-room, sleeping-room; but there were only\r\nten of them, and the closer the warmer.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DR. KANE PAYING A VISIT TO AN ESKIMO HUT AT ETAH.]\r\n\r\nWhile they were engaged in these defences against the enemy, they\r\ncontrived to open up a friendly intercourse with the Eskimos, visiting\r\nthem in their snow-huts at the settlements of Etah and Anatoak, distant\r\nabout thirty and seventy miles from the brig; and, in return for\r\npresents of needles, pins, and knives, they undertook to show the white\r\nstrangers where game was to be procured, as well as to furnish walrus\r\nand fresh seal meat. The assistance rendered by the Eskimos was of the\r\ngreatest value, and we may infer that, without it, Dr. Kane and his\r\nfollowers must have succumbed to the hardships of that dreadful winter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of December, the party which had abandoned the ship\r\nsuddenly reappeared, finding it impossible to penetrate to the\r\nsouth. They had suffered severely; were covered with rime and snow,\r\nand fainting with hunger. It was necessary to use much caution in\r\nconveying them below; for after an exposure of such fearful intensity\r\nand duration as they had undergone, the warmth of the cabin would have\r\nprostrated them completely. They had journeyed three hundred and fifty\r\nmiles; and their last run from the bay near Etah, some seventy miles\r\nin a right line, was through the hummocks with the thermometer at\r\n-50°. “One by one,” says Kane, “they all came in and were housed. Poor\r\nfellows! as they threw open their Eskimo garments by the stove, how\r\nthey relished the scanty luxuries which we had to offer. The coffee,\r\nand the meat-biscuit soup, and the molasses, and the wheat-bread, even\r\nthe salt pork, which our scurvy forbade the rest of us to touch--how\r\nthey relished it all! For more than two months they had lived on frozen\r\nseal and walrus meat.”\r\n\r\nWe cannot dwell on the various little incidents which marked that sad\r\nand terrible winter, but an extract or two from Dr. Kane’s journal will\r\nshow the reader how much the imprisoned explorers endured, and in what\r\nspirit they bore their trials:--\r\n\r\n“_December 1, Friday._--I am writing at midnight. I have the watch\r\nfrom eight to two. It is day in the moonlight on deck, the thermometer\r\ngetting up again to 36° below zero. As I come down to the cabin--for\r\nso we still call this little moss-lined igloë of ours--every one is\r\nasleep, snoring, gritting his teeth, or talking in his dreams. This is\r\npathognomonic; it tells of Arctic winter, and its companion, scurvy.\r\nTom Hickey, our good-humoured, blundering cabin-boy, decorated with the\r\ndignities of cook, is in that little dirty cot on the starboard side;\r\nthe rest are bedded in rows. Mr. Brooks and myself chock aft. Our bunks\r\nare close against the frozen moss-wall, where we can take in the entire\r\nfamily at a glance. The apartment measures twenty feet by eighteen; its\r\nheight six feet four inches at one place, but diversified elsewhere by\r\nbeams crossing at different distances from the floor. The avenue by\r\nwhich it is approached is barely to be seen in the moss-wall forward;\r\ntwenty feet of air-tight space make misty distance, for the puff of\r\noutside temperature that came in with me has filled our atmosphere with\r\nvesicles of vapour. The avenue--Ben-Djerback is our poetic name for\r\nit--closes on the inside with a door well-patched with flannel, from\r\nwhich, stooping upon all fours, you back down a descent of four feet\r\nin twelve through a tunnel three feet high, and two feet six inches\r\nbroad. Arrived at the bottom, you straighten yourself, and a second\r\ndoor admits you into the dark and sorrowing hold, empty of stores, and\r\nstripped to its naked ceiling for firewood. From this we grope our way\r\nto the main hatch, and mount by a rude stairway of boxes into the open\r\nair.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_February 21, Wednesday._--To-day the crests of the north-east\r\nheadland were gilded by true sunshine, and all who were able ascended\r\non deck to greet it. The sun rose above the horizon, though still\r\nscreened from our eyes by intervening hills. Although the powerful\r\nrefraction of Polar latitudes heralds his direct appearance by\r\nbrilliant light, this is as far removed from the glorious tints of\r\nday as it is from the mere twilight. Nevertheless, for the past ten\r\ndays we have been watching the growing warmth of our landscape, as it\r\nemerged from buried shadow, through all the stages of distinctness of\r\nan India-ink washing, step by step, into the sharp, bold definition\r\nof our desolate harbour scene. We have marked every dash of colour\r\nwhich the great Painter in his benevolence vouchsafed to us; and now\r\nthe empurpled blue, clear, unmistakable, the spreading lake, the\r\nflickering yellow; peering at all these, poor wretches! everything\r\nseemed superlative lustre and unsurpassable glory. We had so grovelled\r\nin darkness, that we oversaw the light.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Wilson has caught cold, and relapsed. Mr. Ohlsen, after a\r\nsuspicious day, startles me by an attack of partial epilepsy; one of\r\nthose strange, indescribable spells, fits, seizures, whatever name the\r\njargon gives them, which indicate deep disturbance. I conceal his case\r\nas far as I can; but it adds to my heavy pack of troubles to anticipate\r\nthe gloomy scenes of epileptic transport introduced into our one\r\napartment.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_February 28, Wednesday._--February closes: thank God for the\r\nlapse of its twenty-eight days! Should the thirty-one of the coming\r\nMarch not drag us further downward, we may hope for a successful close\r\nto this dreary drama. By the 10th of April we should have seal; and\r\nwhen they come, if we remain to welcome them, we can call ourselves\r\nsaved.\r\n\r\n“But a fair review of our prospects tells me that I must look the lion\r\nin the face. The scurvy is steadily gaining on us. I do my best to\r\nsustain the more desperate cases; but as fast as I partially build up\r\none, another is stricken down. The disease is perhaps less malignant\r\nthan it was, but it is more diffused throughout our party. Except\r\nWilliam Morton, who is disabled by a frozen heel, not one of our\r\neighteen is exempt. Of the six workers of our party, as I counted them\r\na month ago, two are unable to do out-door work, and the remaining four\r\ndivide the duties of the ship among them. Hans musters his remaining\r\nenergies to conduct the hunt. Petersen is his disheartened, moping\r\nassistant. The other two, Bonsall and myself, have all the daily\r\noffices of household and hospital. We chop five large sacks of ice, cut\r\nsix fathoms of eight-inch hawser into junks of a foot each (for fuel),\r\nserve out the meat when we have it, hack at the molasses, and hew out\r\nwith crowbar and axe the pork and dried apples, pass up the foul slops\r\nand cleansings of our dormitory; and, in a word, cook, _scullionize_,\r\nand attend the sick. Added to this, for five nights running I have kept\r\nwatch from 8 P.M. to 4 A.M., catching cat-naps as I could in the day\r\nwithout changing my clothes, but carefully waking every hour to note\r\nthermometers.\r\n\r\n“Such is the condition in which February leaves us, with forty-one days\r\nmore ahead of just the same character in prospect as the twenty-eight\r\nwhich, thank God! are numbered now with the past. It is saddening to\r\nthink how much those twenty-eight days have impaired our capacities of\r\nendurance. If Hans and myself can only hold on, we may work our way\r\nthrough. All rests upon destiny, or the Power which controls it.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is useless, however, to dwell longer on this melancholy record. Kane\r\nsaw that to abandon the brig was now the only resource: the ice held\r\nit fast, there was no probability of its being released, and a third\r\nwinter in Rensselaer Bay would have been death to the whole party. As\r\nsoon, therefore, as the return of spring in some measure recruited\r\nthe health of his followers, he made the necessary preparations for\r\ndeparture; and on the 20th of May the entire ship’s company bade\r\nfarewell to the _Advance_, and set out on their homeward route.\r\nWith considerable difficulty and arduous labour they hauled their\r\nboats across the rough, hummocky ice, and reached the open sea. On the\r\n17th of June they embarked, and steered for Upernavik, which port they\r\ncalculated upon reaching in fifty-six days. When they got fairly clear\r\nof the land, and in the course of the great ice-drift southward, they\r\nfound their boats so frail and leaky that they could be kept afloat\r\nonly by constant bailing; a labour which told heavily on men already\r\nweakened with disease and want. Starvation stared them in the face,\r\nwhen happily they fell in with and captured a large seal, which they\r\ndevoured voraciously; and this opportune help recruited their failing\r\nenergies. Thenceforth they were in no lack of food, as seals were\r\nplentiful; and early in August, after living for eighty-four days in\r\nthe open air, they found themselves under the comfortable roofs of\r\nUpernavik, enjoying the hospitable welcome of the generous Danes.\r\n\r\nDr. Kane returned to New York on the 11th of October 1855, after an\r\nabsence of thirty months. His discoveries had been important, his\r\nheroism worthy of the race from which he sprung, and none can deny that\r\nhe had well merited the honours he received. Unfortunately, a frame\r\nnever very robust had been broken down by the trials of two Arctic\r\nwinters; and this gallant explorer passed away on the 16th of February\r\n1857, in the thirty-seventh year of his age.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1860, Dr. Hayes, the companion of Dr. Kane, took the command of an\r\nexpedition intended to complete the survey of Kennedy Channel, and to\r\nreach, if it were possible, the North Pole. His schooner, the _United\r\nStates_, was brought up for the winter at Port Foulke, about twenty\r\nmiles south of Rensselaer Harbour; and early in the following April,\r\nDr. Hayes set out on a sledge and boat journey across the sound, and\r\nalong the shores of Grinnell Land.\r\n\r\nFrom the eloquent record of his adventures, which does so much credit\r\nto his literary skill, “An Arctic Boat Journey,” we have already quoted\r\nsome stirring passages; but the following extract we may be allowed to\r\nrepeat, on account of the clear light it throws upon the nature of the\r\ndifficulties Hayes encountered on his northward advance:--\r\n\r\n“The track,” he says, “was rough, past description. I can compare it\r\nto nothing but a promiscuous accumulation of rocks closely packed\r\ntogether, and piled up over a vast plain in great heaps and endless\r\nridges, leaving scarcely a foot of level surface. The interstices\r\nbetween these closely accumulated ice-masses are filled up, to some\r\nextent, with drifted snow. The reader will easily imagine the rest. He\r\nwill see the sledges winding through the tangled wilderness of broken\r\nice-tables, the men and dogs pulling and pushing up their respective\r\nloads. He will see them clambering over the very summit of lofty\r\nridges, through which there is no opening, and again descending on\r\nthe other side--the sledge often plunging over a precipice, sometimes\r\ncapsizing, and frequently breaking. Again he will see the party,\r\nbaffled in their attempt to cross or find a pass, breaking a track with\r\nshovel and handspike; or, again, unable even with these appliances to\r\naccomplish their end, they retreat to seek a better track: and they may\r\nbe lucky enough to find a sort of gap or gateway, upon the winding and\r\nuneven surface of which they will make a mile or so with comparative\r\nease. The snow-drifts are sometimes a help and sometimes a hindrance.\r\nTheir surface is uniformly hard, but not always firm to the foot.\r\nThe crust frequently gives way, and in a most tiresome and provoking\r\nmanner. It will not quite bear the weight, and the foot sinks at the\r\nvery moment when the other is lifted. But, worse than this, the chasms\r\nbetween the hummocks are frequently bridged over with snow in such a\r\nmanner as to leave a considerable space at the bottom quite unfilled;\r\nand at the very moment when all looks promising, down sinks one man\r\nto his middle, another to the neck, another is buried out of sight;\r\nthe sledge gives way,--and to extricate the whole from this unhappy\r\npredicament is probably the labour of hours. It would be difficult to\r\nimagine any kind of labour more disheartening, or which would sooner\r\nsap the energies of both men and animals.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter encountering difficulties like these, which wore out the strength\r\nof most of his party, so that they were compelled to return to the\r\nschooner, Dr. Hayes succeeded in crossing the sound, and began his\r\njourney along the coast. But the difficulties did not abate, and made\r\nsuch demands on the powers of endurance of the travellers, that the\r\nstrongest among them broke down, and had to be left behind in charge of\r\nanother of the party. The resolute Hayes then pushed on, accompanied\r\nby Knorr, and on the 18th of May reached the margin of a deep gulf,\r\nwhere further progress was rendered impossible by the rotten ice and\r\nbroad water-ways. From this point, however, he could see, on the other\r\nside of the channel, and immediately opposite to him, the lofty peak\r\nof Mount Parry, discovered in 1854 by the gallant Morton; and more to\r\nthe north, a bold conspicuous headland, which he named Cape Union, the\r\nmost northern known land upon the globe. Beyond it, he thought he saw\r\nthe open sea of the Pole, which, from Cape Union, is not distant five\r\nhundred miles; but the voyage of the _Polaris_, at a later date,\r\nhas shown that what he saw was only a land-locked bay.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of July, the schooner was set free from the ice, but she\r\nproved to be too much damaged to continue her dangerous voyage; and\r\nsatisfied with having proved that a direct and not impracticable route\r\nto the Pole lies up Smith Sound and Kennedy Channel, Dr. Hayes returned\r\nto Boston.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is the opinion, however, of some geographers, though scarcely\r\nwarranted by ascertained facts, that the Pole may more easily be\r\nreached by what is known as the Spitzbergen route. They argue that\r\nto the east of this snow-crowned archipelago the influence of the\r\nGulf Stream makes itself felt; and they conclude that this great warm\r\ncurrent possibly strikes as far as the Pole itself. It is known that\r\nParry, to the north of Spitzbergen, attained the latitude of 82° 45’;\r\nand it is recorded that a Hull whaler, the _True-Love_, in 1837,\r\nnavigated an open sea in lat. 82° 30’ N., and long. 15° E.; so that she\r\nmight probably have solved the problem and have gained the Pole, had\r\nshe continued on her northerly course.\r\n\r\nHolding this belief, the illustrious German geographer, Dr. Petermann,\r\nsucceeded in raising funds for a German expedition in 1868; and the\r\n_Germania_, a brig of eighty tons, under the command of Captain\r\nKoldewey, sailed from Bergen on the 24th of May, for Shannon Island,\r\nin lat. 75° 14’ N., the furthest point on the Greenland coast reached\r\nby Sabine in 1823. She was accompanied by the _Hansa_, Captain\r\nHegemann; and both ships were equipped in the most careful manner, and\r\nliberally supplied with appliances and stores.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of July the expedition was off the island of Jan Mayen, and\r\nat midnight on that day was sailing direct to the northward. A heavy\r\nfog came on, and the two ships, even when sailing side by side, could\r\nnot see one another, and communication could be maintained only by the\r\nuse of the speaking-trumpet. Their crews might then conceive an idea\r\nof that impenetrable chaos which, according to Pythias, terminated the\r\nworld beyond Thule, and which is neither air, nor earth, nor sea. It is\r\nimpossible to imagine anything more melancholy than this gray, uniform,\r\ninfinite veil or canopy; ocean itself, far as the eye can reach, is\r\ngray and gloomy.\r\n\r\nFor five successive days the weather remained in this condition, the\r\nfog alone varying in intensity, and growing thicker and thicker. On\r\nthe 14th a calm prevailed, and the _Germania_ lowered a boat to\r\npick up drift-wood and hunt the sea-gulls. The ice-blink on the horizon\r\nshowed that the ships were drawing near the great ice-fields of the\r\nPolar Ocean; and another sign of their proximity was the appearance of\r\nthe ivory gull (_Larus eburneus_), which never wanders far from\r\nthe ice. Occasionally the ships fell in with a rorqual, or nord-caper,\r\nas the seamen call it,--a species of whale distinguished by the\r\npresence of a dorsal fin.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 15th of July a light breeze blew up from the\r\nsouth, and the two ships sailed steadily on their north-western course\r\nthrough a sea covered with floating ice. An accustomed ear could\r\nalready distinguish a distant murmur, which seemed to draw nearer\r\nand yet nearer; it was the swell of the sea breaking on the far-off\r\nice-field. Nearer and yet nearer! Everybody gathered upon deck; and,\r\nsuddenly, as if in virtue of some spell, the mists cleared away, and\r\nthe adventurers saw before them, within a few hundred yards, the ice!\r\nIt formed a long line, like a cliff-wall of broken and rugged rocks,\r\nwhose azure-tinted precipices glittered in the sun, and repelled,\r\nunmoved, the rush of the foamy waves. The summit was covered with a\r\ndeep layer of blinding snow.\r\n\r\nThey gazed on the splendid panorama in silence. It was a solemn moment,\r\nand in every mind new thoughts and new impressions were awakened, in\r\nwhich both hope and doubt were blended.\r\n\r\nThe point where the _Germania_ had struck the ice was lat. 74° 47’\r\nN. and long. 11° 50’ E., and the icy barrier stretched almost directly\r\nfrom north to south. The _Hansa_ touched the ice on the same day,\r\nbut in lat. 74° 57’ N., and long. 9° 41’ E.\r\n\r\nThe two ships, which had separated in the fog, effected a union on the\r\n18th, and the _Germania_ taking the _Hansa_ in tow, they made\r\ntowards Sabine Island. After awhile, the towing-rope was thrown off,\r\nthe _Germania_ finding it necessary to extinguish her fires and\r\nproceed under canvas. They then followed up, in a southerly direction,\r\nthe great icy barrier, seeking for an opening which might afford them a\r\nchance of steering westward.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th, the _Germania_ found the ice so thick in the\r\nsouth-west that she adopted a westerly Course, and hoisted a signal\r\nfor the captain of the _Hansa_ to come on board to a conference.\r\nThe latter, however, misinterpreted it, and instead of reading the\r\nsignal as “Come within hail,” read it as “Long stay a peak;” crowded on\r\nall sail, and speedily disappeared in the fog, which grew wonderfully\r\nintense before the _Germania_ could follow her. Through this\r\ncurious error the two ships were separated, and for fourteen months the\r\ncrew of the _Germania_ remained in ignorance of the fate of their\r\ncomrades’.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore following the _Germania_ on her voyage of discovery, we\r\npropose to see what befell the _Hansa_ among the Arctic ice.\r\n\r\nCaptain Hegemann had understood the signal of his senior officer to\r\nmean that the ships were to push on as far as possible to the westward,\r\nand, as we have seen, he crowded on all sail. But when the fog closed\r\nin, and he found himself out of sight of the _Germania_, he\r\nlay-to, in the hope that the latter might rejoin him. Disappointed in\r\nthis, he kept on his way, and on the 28th of July sighted the rocky and\r\ngloomy coast of East Greenland, from Cape Bröer-Ruys to Cape James.\r\n\r\nThe weather continued fine. By the light of the midnight sun, which\r\nilluminated the fantastic outlines of the bergs, the adventurers\r\nengaged in a narwhal-hunt. Nothing is more extraordinary than the\r\neffect of the rays of the midnight sun penetrating into an ocean\r\ncovered with floating ice. The warm and cold tones strike against\r\neach other in all directions; the sea is orange, leaden-gray, or dark\r\ngreen; the reefs of ice are tinged with a delicate rose-bloom; broad\r\nshadows spread over the snow, and the most varied effects of mirage are\r\nproduced everywhere in the tranquil waters.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE CREW OF THE “HANSA” TRYING TO LASSO A BEAR.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE MIDNIGHT SUN, GREENLAND.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A BEAR AT ANCHOR.]\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of September, the _Hansa_ found the channel of free\r\nwater in which she had been navigating closed by a huge mass of ice,\r\nand to protect her against the drift of the floating bergs she was\r\nmoored to it with stout hawsers. A few days later, the ice was broken\r\nup by a gale of wind from the north-east, and the hawsers snapped. The\r\nice accumulating behind the ship raised it a foot and a half. On a\r\ncontiguous sheet of ice, the explorers discovered a she-bear with her\r\ncub, and a boat was despatched in pursuit. The couple soon caught sight\r\nof it, and began to trot along the edge of the ice beside the boat, the\r\nmother grinding her teeth and licking her beard. Her enemies landed,\r\nand fired, and the bear fell in the snow, mortally wounded. While\r\nthe cub was engaged in tenderly licking and caressing her, several\r\nattempts were made to capture it with a lasso; but it always contrived\r\nto extricate itself, and at last took to flight, crying and moaning\r\nbitterly. Though struck with a bullet, it succeeded in effecting its\r\nescape.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the 12th they again saw a couple of bears coming from the east,\r\nand returning from the sea towards the land. The mother fell a victim\r\nto their guns, but the cub was captured, and chained to an anchor\r\nwhich they had driven into the ice. It appeared exceedingly restless\r\nand disturbed, but not the less did it greedily devour a slice of its\r\nmother’s flesh which the sailors threw to it. A snow wigwam was hastily\r\nconstructed for its accommodation, and the floor covered with a layer\r\nof shavings; but the cub despised these luxuries of civilization, and\r\npreferred to encamp on the snow, like a true inhabitant of the Polar\r\nRegions. A few days afterwards it disappeared with its chain, which it\r\nhad contrived to detach from the anchor; and the weight of the iron, in\r\nall probability, had dragged the poor beast to the bottom of the water.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SKATING--OFF THE COAST OF GREENLAND.]\r\n\r\nThe _Hansa_ was now set fast in the ice, and no hope was\r\nentertained of her release until the coming of the spring. Her crew\r\namused themselves with skating, and, when the weather permitted, with\r\nall kinds of gymnastic exercises. It became necessary, however, to\r\nconsider what preparations should be made for encountering the Arctic\r\nwinter, one of the bitterest enemies with which man is called upon to\r\ncontend. The _Hansa_ was strongly built, but her commander feared\r\nshe might not be able to endure the more and more frequent pressure of\r\nthe ice. At first, it was proposed to cover the boats with sail-cloth\r\nand convert them into winter-quarters; but it was felt that they would\r\nnot afford a sufficient protection against the rigour of the Polar\r\nclimate, its furious winds, its excess of cold, its wild whirlwinds of\r\nsnow. And therefore it was resolved to erect on the ice-floe a suitable\r\nwinter-hut, constructed of blocks of coal. Bricks made of this material\r\nhave the double advantage of absorbing humidity, and reflecting the\r\nheat which they receive. Water and snow would serve for mortar; and a\r\nroof could be made with the covering which protected the deck of the\r\n_Hansa_ from the snow.\r\n\r\nThe ground-plan of the house was designed by Captain Hegemann; it\r\nmeasured twenty feet in length, and fourteen feet in width; the ridge\r\nof the roof was eight feet and a half, and the side walls four feet\r\neight inches in elevation. These walls were composed of a double row\r\nof bricks nine inches wide up to a height of two feet, after which a\r\nsingle row was used. They were cemented in a peculiarly novel fashion.\r\nThe joints and fissures were filled up with dry snow, on which water\r\nwas poured, and in ten minutes it hardened into a compact mass, from\r\nwhich it would have been exceedingly difficult to extract a solitary\r\nbrick. The roof consisted of sails and mats, covered with a layer of\r\nsnow. The door was two and a half feet wide, and the floor was paved\r\nwith slabs of coal. Into this house, which was completed in seven days,\r\nprovisions for two months were carried, including four hundred pounds\r\nof bread, two dozen boxes of preserved meat, a flitch of bacon, some\r\ncoffee and brandy, besides a supply of firing-wood, and some tons of\r\ncoal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of October, after the completion of the house, a violent\r\nsnow-storm broke out, which would assuredly have rendered its\r\nconstruction impossible, and which, in five days, completely buried\r\nboth the ship and the hut. Such immense piles of snow accumulated on\r\nthe deck of the _Hansa_, that it was with the greatest difficulty\r\nthe seamen could reach their berths.\r\n\r\nFrom the 5th to the 14th of October the drift of the current was so\r\nstrong, that the ice-bound ship was carried no fewer than seventy-two\r\nmiles towards the south-south-east.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the pressure of the ice continued to increase, and the\r\n_Hansa_ seemed held in the tightening grasp of an invincible\r\ngiant. Huge masses rose in front, and behind, and on both sides,\r\nand underneath, until she was raised seventeen feet higher than\r\nher original position. Affairs seemed so critical, that Captain\r\nHegemann hastened to disembark the stores of clothing, the scientific\r\ninstruments, charts, log-book, and diaries. It was found that through\r\nthe constant strain on her timbers the ship had begun to leak badly,\r\nand on sounding, two feet of water were found in the pumps. All hands\r\nto work! But after half an hour’s vigorous exertions, the water\r\ncontinued to rise, slowly but surely; and the most careful search\r\nfailed to indicate the locality of the leak. It was painfully evident\r\nthat the good ship could not be saved.\r\n\r\n“Though much affected,” says the chronicler of the expedition, “by\r\nthis sad catastrophe, we endured it with firmness. Resignation was\r\nindispensable. The coal hut, constructed on the shifting ice-floe, was\r\nthenceforward our sole refuge in the long nights of an Arctic winter,\r\nand was destined, perhaps, to become our tomb.\r\n\r\n“But we had not a minute to lose, and we set to work. At nine o’clock\r\nP.M. the snow-fall ceased; the sky glittered with stars, the\r\nmoon illuminated with her radiance the immense wilderness of ice, and\r\nthe rays of the Aurora Borealis here and there lighted up the firmament\r\nwith their coloured coruscations. The frost was severe; during the\r\nnight the thermometer sank to -20° R. One half the crew continued to\r\nwork at the pumps; the other was actively engaged in disembarking on\r\nthe ice the most necessary articles. There could be no thought of\r\nsleep, for in our frightful situation the mind was beset by the most\r\nconflicting apprehensions. What would become of us at the very outset\r\nof a season which threatened to be one of excessive rigour? In vain\r\nwe endeavoured to imagine some means of saving ourselves. It was not\r\npossible to think seriously of an attempt to gain the land. Perhaps we\r\nmight have succeeded, in the midst of the greatest dangers, in reaching\r\nthe coast by opening up a way across the ice-floes, but we had no\r\nmeans of transporting thither our provisions; and it appeared, from\r\nthe reports of Scoresby, that we could not count on finding any Eskimo\r\nestablishments,--so that our only prospect then would have been to die\r\nof hunger.”\r\n\r\nThe sole resource remaining to the explorers was to drift to the\r\nsouth on their moving ice-floe, and confine themselves, meantime, to\r\ntheir coal hut. If their ice-raft proved of sufficient strength, they\r\nmight hope to reach in the spring the Eskimo settlement in the south\r\nof Greenland, or come to gain the coast of Iceland by traversing its\r\ncincture of ice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was on the 22nd of October, in lat. 70° 50’ N., and long. 21° W.,\r\nthat the _Hansa_ sank beneath the ice. Dr. Laube writes: “We\r\nmade ourselves as snug as possible, and, once our little house was\r\ncompletely embanked with snow, we had not to complain of the cold.\r\nWe enjoyed perfect health, and occupied the time with long walks and\r\nwith our books, of which we had many. We made a Christmas-tree of\r\nbirch-twigs, and embellished it with fragments of wax taper.”\r\n\r\nTo prevent attacks of disease, and to maintain the cheerfulness of the\r\nmen, the officers of the expedition stimulated them to every kind of\r\nactive employment, and laid down strict rules for the due division of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nAt seven in the morning, they were aroused by the watch. They rose,\r\nattired themselves in their warm thick woollen clothing, washed in\r\nwater procured by melting snow, and then took their morning cup of\r\ncoffee, with a piece of hard bread. Various occupations succeeded:\r\nthe construction of such useful utensils as proved to be necessary;\r\nstitching sail-cloth, mending clothes, writing up the day’s journal,\r\nand reading. When the weather permitted, astronomical observations and\r\ncalculations were not forgotten. At noon, all hands were summoned to\r\ndinner, at which a good rich soup formed the principal dish; and as\r\nthey had an abundance of preserved vegetables, the bill of fare was\r\nfrequently changed. In the use of alcoholic liquors the most rigid\r\neconomy was observed, and it was on Sunday only that each person\r\nreceived a glass of port.\r\n\r\nThe ice-floe on which their cabin stood was assiduously and carefully\r\nexplored in all directions. It was about seven miles in circuit, and\r\nits average diameter measured nearly two miles.\r\n\r\nThe out-of-door amusements consisted chiefly of skating, and building\r\nup huge images of snow--Egyptian sphynxes and the like.\r\n\r\nThe borders of the ice-floe, especially to the west and south-west,\r\npresented a curious aspect; the attrition and pressure of the floating\r\nice had built up about it high glittering walls, upwards of ten feet\r\nin elevation. The snow-crystals flashed and radiated in the sun like\r\nmyriads of diamonds. The red gleam of morning and evening cast a\r\nstrange emerald tint on the white surface of the landscape. The nights\r\nwere magnificent. The glowing firmament, and the snow which reflected\r\nits lustre, produced so intense a brightness, that it was possible\r\nto read without fatigue the finest handwriting, and to distinguish\r\nremote objects. The phenomenon of the Aurora Borealis was of constant\r\noccurrence, and on one occasion was so wonderfully luminous that it\r\npaled the radiance of the stars, and everything upon the ice-floe cast\r\na shadow, as if it had been the sun shining.\r\n\r\nNear the coal-cabin stood two small huts, one of which served for\r\nablutions, the other as a shed. Round this nucleus of the little\r\nshipwrecked colony were situated at convenient points the piles of\r\nwood for fuel, the boats, and the barrels of patent fuel and pork. To\r\nprevent the wind and snow from entering the dwelling-hut, a vestibule\r\nwas constructed, with a winding entrance.\r\n\r\nThe greatest cold experienced was -29° 30’ F., and this was in\r\nDecember. After Christmas the little settlement was visited by several\r\nsevere storms, and their ice-raft drifted close along the shore,\r\nsometimes within eight or nine miles, amidst much ice-crushing,--which\r\nso reduced it on all sides, that by the 4th of January 1870 it did not\r\nmeasure more than one-eighth of its original dimensions.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of January, when they had descended as far south as 66° 45’\r\nN. lat., the sun reappeared, and was joyfully welcomed.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 15th of January, the colony was stricken by a\r\nsudden and terrible alarm. The ice yawned asunder, immediately beneath\r\nthe hut, and its occupants had but just time to take refuge in their\r\nboats. Here they lay in a miserable condition, unable to clear out\r\nthe snow, and sheltered very imperfectly from the driving, furious\r\ntempest. But on the 17th the gale moderated, and as soon as the weather\r\npermitted they set to work to reconstruct out of the ruins of the old\r\nhut a new but much smaller one. It was not large enough to accommodate\r\nmore than half the colony; and the other half took up their residence\r\nin the boats.\r\n\r\nFebruary was calm and fine, and the floe still continued to drift\r\nsouthward along the land. The nights were gorgeous with auroral\r\ndisplays. Luminous sheaves expanded themselves on the deep blue\r\nfirmament like the folds of a fan, or the petals of a flower.\r\n\r\nMarch was very snowy, and mostly dull. On the 4th, the ice-raft passed\r\nwithin twenty-five miles of the glacier Kolberger-Heide. A day or two\r\nlater, it nearly came into collision with a large grounded iceberg. The\r\nportion nearest to the drifting colony formed an immense overhanging\r\nmass; its principal body had been wrought by the action of the sun\r\nand the waves into the most capricious forms, and seemed an aggregate\r\nof rocks and pinnacles, towers and gateways. The castaways could have\r\nseized its projecting angles as they floated past. They thought their\r\ndestruction certain, but the fragments of ice which surrounded the raft\r\nserved as “buffers,” and saved it from a fatal collision.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of March, they found themselves in the latitude of\r\nNukarbik, the island where Graab, the explorer, wintered, from\r\nSeptember 3rd, 1827, to April 5th, 1830. They had cherished the hope\r\nthat from this spot they might be able to take to their boats, and\r\nstart for Friedrichstal, a Moravian missionary station on the south\r\ncoast of Greenland. However, the ice was as yet too compact for any\r\nsuch venture to be attempted.\r\n\r\nFor four weeks they were detained in the bay of Nukarbik, only two\r\nor three miles from the shore, and yet unable to reach it. Their\r\nraft was caught in a kind of eddy, and sometimes tacked to the south,\r\nsometimes to the north. The rising tide carried it towards the shore,\r\nthe ebbing tide floated it out again to sea. During this detention they\r\nwere visited by small troops of birds, snow linnets and snow buntings.\r\nThe seamen threw them a small quantity of oats, which they greedily\r\ndevoured. They were so tame that they allowed themselves to be caught\r\nby the hand.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SNOW LINNETS AND BUNTINGS VISITING THE CREW OF THE\r\n  “HANSA.”]\r\n\r\nFrom the end of March to the 17th of April, the voyagers continued\r\ntheir dreary vacillation between Skieldunge Island and Cape Moltke; a\r\nstorm then drove them rapidly to the south. The coast, with its bold\r\nlittoral mountain-chain, its deep bays, its inlets, its islands, and\r\nits romantic headlands, offered a succession of novel and impressive\r\nscenes; and specially imposing was the great glacier of Puisortok, a\r\nmighty ice-river which skirts the shore for upwards of thirty miles.\r\n\r\nEarly in May they had reached lat. 61° 12’.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th, some water-lanes opened for them a way to the shore; and\r\nabandoning the ice-raft, they took to their boats, with the intention\r\nof progressing southward along the coast. At first they met with\r\nconsiderable difficulty, being frequently compelled to haul up the\r\nboats on an ice-floe, and so pass the night, or wait until the wind was\r\nfavourable. As this necessitated a continual unloading and reloading of\r\nthe boats, the work was very severe. At one time they were detained\r\nfor six days on the ice, owing to bad weather, violent gales, and heavy\r\nsnow-showers. The temperature varied from +2° during the day to -5° R.\r\nduring the night.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE CREW OF THE “HANSA” BIVOUACKING ON THE ICE.]\r\n\r\nTheir rations at this period were thus distributed:--In the morning, a\r\ncup of coffee, with a piece of dry bread. At noon, for dinner, soup and\r\nbroth; in the evening, a few mouthfuls of cocoa, of course without milk\r\nand sugar.\r\n\r\nThey were compelled to observe the most rigid economy in the use of\r\ntheir provisions, lest, before reaching any settlement, they should be\r\nreduced to the extremities of famine. Yet their appetite was very keen;\r\na circumstance easily explained, for they were necessarily very sparing\r\nin their allowance of meat and fat, which in the rigorous Arctic\r\nclimate are indispensable as nourishment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs no change took place in the position of the masses of ice which\r\nsurrounded them, they resolved to drag their boats towards the\r\nisland of Illiudlek, about three marine miles distant. They began\r\nthis enterprise on the evening of the 20th, making use of some stout\r\ncables which they had manufactured during the winter, and harnessing\r\nthemselves by means of a brace passed across the shoulders. That\r\nevening they accomplished three hundred paces. Snow fell heavily, and\r\nmelted as fast as it fell, so that during their night-bivouac they\r\nsuffered much from damp.\r\n\r\nThe next day they found before them such a labyrinth of blocks and\r\nfragments of ice, floating ice-fields, and water-channels, that they\r\nwere constrained to give up the idea of hauling their boats across\r\nit, and resolved to wait for the spring tide--which, they knew, would\r\noccur in a few days. The delay was very wearisome. To beguile the time,\r\nsome of the seamen set to work at wood-carving, while the officers\r\nand scientific gentlemen manufactured the pieces for a game of chess.\r\nOthers prepared some fishing-lines, eighty fathoms long, in the hope of\r\ncatching a desirable addition to their scanty bill of fare.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th, the weather was splendid. The sun shone in a cloudless\r\nsky, and wherever its genial radiance fell the thermometer marked +\r\n28° 5’ R. This was an excellent opportunity for drying their clothes,\r\nwhich, as well as their linen, had been thoroughly soaked innumerable\r\ntimes. The coverings were removed from the boats, which, in the warm\r\nsunshine, exhaled great clouds of vapour. The cook endeavoured to\r\nadd to his stores of provisions; but the seals churlishly refused to\r\nmake their appearance, the fish disdained to nibble at the fat-baited\r\nhooks, and the stupid guillemots were cunning enough to escape the best\r\ndirected shots.\r\n\r\nM. Hildebrandt, with two seamen, made an attempt--in which they\r\nsucceeded--to reach the island of Illiudlek, which lay about three\r\nmiles off, and is from 450 to 500 feet in height. They found it a\r\ndesert; not a trace of vegetation; its shores very steep, and at some\r\npoints precipitous; its surface torn with crevasses and ravines. The\r\nonly accessible part seemed on the north; but as the evening was\r\ndrawing in, they had no time for exploration, and made haste to return\r\nto the boats.\r\n\r\nThe castaways now came to a resolution to seek a temporary refuge on\r\nthis desolate isle. As the heat of the sun was sufficient to render\r\ntheir labour very painful, and they suffered much from the effects of\r\nthe snow upon their eyes, they went to work at night, dragging their\r\nboats forward with many a weary effort, and rested during the daytime.\r\nIn this way they reached the island on the 4th of June.\r\n\r\nHere they moored their boats in a small bay sheltered by a wall of\r\nrocks from the north wind, which they named _Hansa-Hafen_. Next\r\nday they shot two-and-twenty divers, which provided them with a\r\ncouple of good dinners. The supply was very valuable, as the stock of\r\nprovisions on hand would not last above a fortnight.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief rest, the adventurers resumed their voyage, keeping\r\nclose in-shore, and struggling perseveringly amidst ice and\r\nstones--and further checked by an inaccurate chart, which led them\r\ninto a deep fiord, instead of King Christian IV. Sound. On the 13th\r\nof June, however, they arrived at the Moravian missionary station of\r\nFriedrichstal, where their countrymen received them with a hearty\r\nwelcome. For two hundred days they had sojourned upon a drifting\r\nice-field, experiencing all the hardships of an Arctic winter,\r\naggravated by an insufficiency of food.\r\n\r\nThey reached Julianshaab on the 21st of June; embarked on board the\r\nDanish brig _Constance_; and were landed at Copenhagen on the 1st\r\nof September.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe must now return to the _Germania_.\r\n\r\nCaptain Koldewey made several bold attempts to penetrate the pack-ice,\r\nbut proved unsuccessful in all until, on the 1st of August, he reached\r\nlat. 74°, where he contrived to effect a passage; and though much\r\ndelayed by a succession of fogs and calms, he made his way to Sabine\r\nIsland,--and dropped anchor on its southern side, in lat. 74° 30’ N.,\r\nand long. 29° W., on the 5th of August.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th he again passed towards the north, keeping along the\r\nGreenland shore until, in lat. 75° 31’ N., his advance was checked by\r\na mass of closely-packed ice, which stretched from the coast of the\r\nmainland out to Shannon Island, a long unbroken line of fourteen miles.\r\nIt presented a very formidable appearance, being edged in some places\r\nwith a fringe of broken ice, boulders, and blocks, rising in heaps and\r\nhummocks forty feet high.\r\n\r\nThe _Germania_ remained in this position for several days. As\r\nnothing but ice was visible to the northward, and no prospect opened\r\nup of further progress in that direction, Captain Koldewey moved his\r\nship to the south side of the island on the 16th of August, and dropped\r\nanchor close to Cape Philip Broke.\r\n\r\nEleven days were spent in a careful exploration of Shannon Island,\r\nduring which time a musk-ox was shot, and close watch was kept from an\r\nelevated point on the ice lying to the northward. But as it continued\r\nsolid and immovable, and the end of the season was at hand, Captain\r\nKoldewey returned northward, and brought his vessel to anchor on the\r\nsouth side of Pendulum Island on the 27th of August.\r\n\r\nWhen it became necessary to make preparations for facing the coming\r\nwinter, Captain Koldewey moved his ship on the 13th of September\r\ninto the little harbour he had occupied on the 5th of August. Their\r\nsubsequent experience showed it to be the only secure one between the\r\nparallels of 74° and 77°. A few days later the ship was frozen in.\r\n\r\nThe first sledging-party was despatched on the 14th of September,\r\nand remained out for eight days. After reaching the mainland,\r\nthey travelled for four days up a newly-discovered fiord, finding\r\nmany petrifactions and much lignite. They also saw large herds of\r\nmusk-oxen. Vegetation was abundant, but chiefly composed of species of\r\n_Andromeda_. In the course of this excursion, our explorers had\r\none or two adventures with bears. First, a female, with her two cubs,\r\npaid them a visit, but being received with some volleys of musketry,\r\nquickly beat a retreat. On another occasion, a daring intruder found\r\nhis way into their tent. His temerity, however, cost him his life;\r\nand the Germans banqueted gaily on the fat and flesh with which he\r\nincontinently supplied them.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A RASH INTRUDER.]\r\n\r\nWhen the winter preparations were completed, Captain Koldewey organized\r\nseveral shooting parties, who made good booty of reindeer and musk-oxen\r\nand added most satisfactorily to the provision-supplies; no fewer than\r\nfifteen hundred pounds of good beef and venison attesting the skill\r\nand good fortune of the hunters. But after the beginning of November,\r\nneither musk-oxen, reindeer, nor bears were visible.\r\n\r\nA second sledge journey was undertaken towards the end of October in a\r\nsoutherly direction. The party discovered another fiord, and returned\r\non the 4th of November. On the following day the sun disappeared\r\naltogether, and the dreary Arctic night of three months’ duration\r\novertook them.\r\n\r\nThe close of the year was marked by a succession of violent storms, and\r\nthe temperature rose to 25° F. It soon fell again to zero, however; but\r\nit was not until 1870 that it indicated the maximum of cold experienced\r\nthroughout the winter,--namely, -40° F. Of the December gales, the\r\nmost furious broke out on the 16th, and lasted until the 20th. It set\r\nfree the ice in the harbour, and even to within three hundred yards of\r\nthe ship; but fortunately she had been anchored in the most sheltered\r\npart of the bay, and close to the shore, in only ten feet of water;\r\notherwise the crushed-up ice, moving with the currents, would probably\r\nhave carried her away to almost certain destruction.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: BEAR-HUNTING--GREENLAND.]\r\n\r\nThe heroic little company, however, were nowise disheartened by the\r\ngloom and hardship of their situation. From Captain Koldewey’s account,\r\nthey would seem to have spent a right merry Christmas, after the hearty\r\nGerman fashion. They danced by starlight upon the ice; they celebrated\r\nChristmas Eve with open doors, the temperature being 25° F.; with the\r\nevergreen _Andromeda_ they made a famous Christmas-tree; they\r\ndecorated the cabin with flags, and spread out upon their tables the\r\ngifts prepared for the occasion by kindly hands: each received his\r\nshare, and each joined in and contributed to the general merriment.\r\n\r\nThe Yule-tide festivities over, they made ready the equipments for\r\ntheir sledging expeditions in the ensuing spring,--the object of the\r\nmost important of these being to attain the highest possible degree of\r\nnorth latitude.\r\n\r\nIn February the sun returned, and with it the bears; and the daily\r\nexcursions upon the island, undertaken by the scientific members of\r\nthe expedition, were rendered dangerous by their audacity. Every one\r\nwas required to go armed, yet some accidents occurred. One of the\r\n“scientists” was severely wounded in the head, and dragged upwards of\r\nfour hundred paces before his comrades rescued him from the bear. After\r\nthe lapse of a few weeks, however, he recovered from his wounds.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of March, the first sledge-party left the ship, and\r\ntravelled northward until, on the 15th of April, they reached 77° 1’\r\nN. lat. Then the wild northerly gales compelled them to retrace their\r\nsteps. On their return they were fortunate enough to shoot some bears,\r\nwhose blubber supplied them with fuel to warm their food; and the\r\nwind filling the sails which they had hoisted on their sledges, they\r\nprogressed with such rapidity as to reach the ship on the 27th of April.\r\n\r\nAt the northernmost point attained by this party,--lat. 77° 1’,--the\r\nbelt of land-ice which skirted the shore seemed to the travellers to\r\nbe four miles in width and several years old. They speak of it as a\r\n“bulwark built for eternity.” Out to seaward, the ice, which was very\r\nhummocky, stretched in an unbroken expanse.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: “INTO A WATER-GAP.”]\r\n\r\nTwo other sledge-parties were sent out early in May: one of these\r\nwas employed in making geographical and scientific explorations of\r\nthe neighbouring coast of Greenland; the other in attempting the\r\nmeasurement of an arc of the meridian. Their journeys were difficult\r\nenough and troublesome enough, and made large demands on the energies\r\nof those who undertook them. Crossing hummocks and rugged ice was\r\nweary work, and sometimes the whole party plunged into deep drifts of\r\nsnow. On one occasion, the sledge was precipitated into a water-gap,\r\nor crevasse; and before it could be recovered and hauled up on the\r\nice-floe, they were compelled to unload it, and remove each article,\r\none by one. Then again they would have to make their way through a\r\nstorm of pitiless violence; the north wind driving the frozen snow into\r\ntheir faces with a fury that almost blinded them. Up to their knees in\r\nthe new snow, they pressed forward with a dogged intrepidity; enduring\r\nhardships and triumphing over obstacles of which the “mob of gentlemen\r\nwho stay at home at ease” can form no adequate conception.\r\n\r\nThe bears now increased in numbers and in boldness, as if they had\r\ndetermined to besiege the small company now left on board the ship. The\r\ngreatest caution was necessary to prevent accidents; and though several\r\nwere shot, their death did not appear to terrify the survivors.\r\n\r\nThe thaw began about the middle of May, and towards the close of the\r\nmonth the sledge-parties were forced to wade through the water which\r\nflooded the surface of the sea-ice.\r\n\r\nIn June, large portions of land-ice were continually breaking off, and\r\nmuch open water could be descried in the south-east. But it was not\r\nuntil the 10th of July that the ice around the ship broke up. Four days\r\nlater, boating became practicable, and a voyage was made to the Eskimo\r\nvillage on Clavering Island. It ended in disappointment,--the village\r\nhaving been deserted, and the huts having fallen into ruin.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of July, the _Germania_ once more steamed to\r\nthe northward, to renew the attempt of the preceding year. Her\r\nboiler-tubes, however, leaked so seriously, that it was evident\r\nthe boiler would speedily fail altogether. After some delay it was\r\ntemporarily patched up; and by following a narrow channel between\r\nthe loose pack-ice and the firm ice-belt of the coast, she contrived\r\nto push forward to the north-east cape of Shannon Island, in lat.\r\n75° 29’ N. Here the ice barrier showed itself compact, solid, and\r\ninsuperable. The _Germania_, therefore, on the 30th of July, made\r\nfor the southward, and continued her explorations in that direction.\r\nThe “Mackenzie Inlet,” which Captain Clavering discovered in 1823, was\r\nfound to have disappeared; its place being occupied by a low, flat\r\nplain, on which herds of reindeer were pasturing. So unaccustomed were\r\nthey to the sight of man, and so fearless of danger, that five of them\r\nwere speedily shot.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of August, the _Germania_ discovered and entered a\r\nbroad, deep fiord in lat. 73° 13’. It was perfectly free from ice; but\r\na fleet of huge icebergs was sailing out of it with the current. It was\r\nsoon noticed that the farther they ascended this picturesque sea-arm,\r\nthe warmer became the temperature of the air and of the surface water.\r\nIt threw off several branches, and these wound in and out among lofty\r\nmountains. Their declivities were washed by cascades, and their ravines\r\nfilled with glaciers; so that the prospect thus unexpectedly opened up\r\nof the interior of Greenland was singularly romantic and impressive.\r\n\r\nSome of the adventurers ascended a mountain 7000 feet in height;\r\nbut even from this lofty watch-tower no limit could be discerned to\r\nthe western or principal arm of the fiord. In about 32° W. long.\r\nthe mountain-range rose, it was ascertained, to an elevation of\r\n14,000 feet. The _Germania_ penetrated for seventy-two miles\r\ninto this remarkable inlet, and reached 26° W. long.; but her boiler\r\nacting irregularly, and Captain Koldewey being apprehensive of the\r\nconsequences if it wholly failed, commenced his homeward voyage on\r\nthe 17th of August. He re-entered the pack-ice at the mouth of the\r\nfiord, and was occupied until the 24th in forcing his way through\r\nit,--reaching the open, iceless sea in lat. 72° N. and long. 14° W.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE CREW OF THE “GERMANIA” IN A SNOW-STORM.]\r\n\r\nThe _Germania_, owing to the uselessness of her boiler, made the\r\nrest of her voyage under sail, and arrived at Bremen in safety on\r\nthe 11th of September, with all well on board. It is worth notice\r\nthat, with the exception of two accidental wounds, this interesting\r\nexpedition was accomplished without any kind of sickness,--a\r\ncircumstance which speaks highly for the forethought and carefulness of\r\nthose engaged in equipping and conducting it.\r\n\r\nWe have been indebted for our brief notice of the voyage of the\r\n_Germania_ to a paper by Captain Sir Leopold M’Clintock, who\r\nsums up its results in a condensed and intelligible form; and to the\r\nnarratives by Captain Koldewey and his officers, translated by Mr.\r\nMercier, and published under the direction of Mr. H. W. Bates.\r\n\r\nThe Greenland shore, under the seventy-fifth parallel of latitude, is\r\nnot the frozen desert which it has hitherto been supposed to be. It is\r\nfrequented by large herds of reindeer, as many as fifty having been\r\nsighted at a time. Musk-oxen were by no means rare, but made their\r\nappearance in troops of fifteen or sixteen; while smaller animals, such\r\nas ermines and lemmings, were also met with. Birds were not numerous;\r\nshoals of walruses were noticed, but no whales.\r\n\r\nGeographically speaking, the voyage was valuable from the observations\r\nobtained in reference to a region which previously was almost unknown.\r\n\r\nThe absence of natives, and of all recent traces of them, is a\r\nremarkable fact. In 1829, Captain Graab found the northern Greenlanders\r\nranging as high as 64° 15’ N. lat.; but they knew nothing of any human\r\nbeings living further north; nor could they themselves travel in that\r\ndirection, the way being blocked up by huge impassable glaciers.\r\n\r\nIn 1822, when Scoresby partially explored the Greenland coast between\r\nthe parallels of 70° and 72° 30’, he discovered many ruined habitations\r\nand graves, but no recent indications of human beings.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, Captain Clavering met with a party of Eskimos\r\nin 74°; but neither he nor Scoresby found reindeer or musk-oxen; and\r\nthe fact ascertained by the _Germania_ that, in 1869, these\r\nanimals were numerous, and devoid of any fear of man, gives reason to\r\nsuppose that few, if any, of this isolated tribe of Eskimos are now in\r\nexistence. Now, as the musk-oxen, and also the reindeer, seem to have\r\nwandered hither from the _northward_, we may conjecture that the\r\nnatives followed the same route.\r\n\r\n“If it be true,” says M’Clintock, “that this migration of men and\r\nanimals was effected from west to east along the northern shore of\r\nGreenland, we naturally assume that it does not extend far towards the\r\nPole; that, probably, its most northern point is at the eastern outlet\r\nof Kennedy Channel, and that it turns from thence sharply towards the\r\neast and north-east,--the distance, in a straight line, to the most\r\nnorthern point reached by Koldewey, is not more than six hundred miles.\r\nIt is not less strange than sad to find that a peaceable and once\r\nnumerous tribe, inhabiting a coast-line of at least 7° of latitude in\r\nextent, has died out, or has almost died out, whilst at the same time\r\nwe find, by the diminution of the glaciers and increase of animal life,\r\nthat the terrible severity of the climate has undergone considerable\r\nmodification. We feel this saddening interest with greater force when\r\nwe reflect that the distance of Clavering’s village from the coast of\r\nScotland is under one thousand miles! They were our nearest neighbours\r\nof the New World.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReturning suddenly to the sixteenth century, we find the names of\r\nsome Dutch seamen of eminence inscribed in the record of early Arctic\r\nDiscovery, and amongst these the most illustrious is that of William\r\nBarents. We refer to him here, because he is connected with Carlsen’s\r\nvoyage in 1869, which went over much the same ground as that which the\r\nDutch explorer had surveyed nearly three hundred years before.\r\n\r\nThe merchants of Amsterdam having fitted out a ship--the\r\n_Mercurius_, of one hundred tons--to attempt a passage round\r\nthe northern end of Novaia Zemlaia, the command was given to William\r\nBarents; who accordingly sailed from the Texel on the 4th of June 1594.\r\n\r\nHe sighted Novaia Zemlaia, in lat. 73° 25’ N., on the 4th of July,\r\nsailed along its grim, gaunt coast, doubled Cape Nassau on the 10th,\r\nand struck the edge of the northern ice on the 13th. For several days\r\nhe skirted this formidable barrier, vainly seeking for an opening; and\r\nin quest of a channel into the further sea, he sailed perseveringly\r\nfrom Cape Nassau to the Orange Islands. He went over no fewer than\r\nseventeen hundred miles of ground in his assiduous search, and put\r\nhis ship about one-and-eighty times. He discovered also the long line\r\nof coast between the two points we have named, laying it down with\r\nan exactness which has been acknowledged by later explorers. His men\r\nwearying of labour which seemed to yield no positive results, Barents\r\nwas under the necessity of returning home.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MATERIALS FOR THE HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nIn 1596 the Amsterdammers fitted out another expedition, consisting\r\nof two strongly-built ships, under Jacob van Heemskerch and Jan\r\nCornelizoon Rijp, with Barents as pilot, though really in command.\r\n\r\nIn this voyage the adventurers kept away from the land, in order to\r\navoid the pack-ice, and sailing to the westward, discovered Bear Island\r\non the 9th of June. Then they steered to the northward, and hove in\r\nsight of Spitzbergen exactly ten days later. They supposed, however,\r\nthat it was only a part of Greenland, and were led to bear away to the\r\nnorth-west--a course which was speedily arrested by the eternal icy\r\nbarrier. Barents then coasted along the western side of Spitzbergen;\r\nand the north-western headland being frequented by an immense number of\r\nbirds, he called it Vogelsang.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of July he again made Bear Island, and here he and Rijp\r\nagreed to separate. Of the latter we know only that he was unsuccessful\r\nin an attempt to find an opening in the ice on the east of Greenland,\r\nand that he returned to Holland in the same year. Of the former the\r\nnarrative is painfully full and interesting.\r\n\r\nQuitting Bear Island, he reached Novaia Zemlaia on the 17th of\r\nJuly, sighting the coast in lat. 74° 40’ N. Keeping along it with\r\ncharacteristic perseverance until the 7th of August, he passed Cape\r\nComfort; but only to find himself once more face to face with the\r\ndreary spectacle of the far-reaching Polar ice. It so hemmed and fenced\r\nhim in on every side, that he was unable to extricate his vessel from\r\nit; and being driven into a bay, which he named Ice Haven, “there they\r\nwere forced, in great cold, poverty, misery, and griefe, to stay all\r\nthe winter.” For the heavy pack-ice drifting into the bay closed it up,\r\nand closed around the ship until she was held fast as in iron bonds.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ATTACK ON A BEAR.]\r\n\r\nBarents and his sixteen followers now prepared to encounter with a good\r\nheart the trials of the long Arctic winter-night. They displayed, in\r\ntruth, a courage, a patience, and a good fellowship which were heroic.\r\nFinding a large supply of drift-wood, they constructed, with the help\r\nof planks from the poop and forecastle of the vessel, a sufficiently\r\ncommodious house, into which they removed all their stores and\r\nprovisions. They fixed a chimney in the centre of the roof; a Dutch\r\nclock was set up and duly struck the weary hours; the sleeping-berths\r\nwere ranged along the walls; a wine-cask was converted into a bath.\r\nAll these ingenious devices, however, availed but little against the\r\nterrible feeling of depression which is induced by the continuance for\r\nso many weeks of a blank and cheerless darkness.\r\n\r\nThe sun disappeared on the 4th of November, and the cold thereafter\r\nincreased until it was almost intolerable. Their wine and beer were\r\nfrozen, and lost all their strength. By means of great fires, by\r\napplying heated stones to their feet, and by wrapping themselves up in\r\ndouble fox-skin coats, they barely contrived to keep off the deadly\r\ncold. In searching for drift-wood they endured the sharpest pain,\r\nand often braved imminent danger. To add to their troubles, they had\r\nmuch ado to defend themselves against the bears, which made frequent\r\nassaults on their hut. However, they contrived to slaughter some of\r\nthe audacious animals, and their fat provided them with oil for their\r\nlamps. When the sun disappeared the bears departed, and then the white\r\nfoxes came in great numbers. They were much more welcome visitors, and\r\nbeing caught in traps, set in the vicinity of the house, supplied the\r\nice-bound voyagers with food and clothing.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SETTING FOX-TRAPS.]\r\n\r\nWhen the 19th of December arrived, they found some comfort in the\r\nreflection that half the dreary season of darkness had passed away,\r\nand that they could now count every day as bringing them nearer to\r\nthe joyful spring. They suffered much, but endured their sufferings\r\nbravely; and celebrated Twelfth Night with a little sack, two pounds of\r\nmeat, and some merry games. The gunner drew the prize, and became King\r\nof Novaia Zemlaia, “which is at least two hundred miles long, and lyeth\r\nbetween two seas.”\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of January every heart rejoiced, for the glowing disc of\r\nthe sun reappeared above the horizon. But it brought with it their old\r\nenemies the bears, against whom they found it necessary to exercise the\r\ngreatest vigilance.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of February they again saw “much open water in the sea,\r\nwhich in long time they had not seene.” During the whole month violent\r\nstorms broke out, and the snow fell in enormous quantities.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of March a gale from the north-east brought back the ice,\r\nand the open water disappeared; the ice driving in with much fury and\r\na mighty noise, the pieces crashing against each other, “fearful to\r\nhear.” Up to the 8th of May the ice was everywhere, and their sad eyes\r\ncould look forth on no pleasant or hopeful scene. Then it began to\r\nbreak up, and the gaunt, weary explorers prepared to tempt the sea once\r\nmore. They set to work to repair their two boats, for their ship was\r\nso crippled and strained by the ice that she was injured beyond their\r\nability to repair.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: RELIEVED.]\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of June they quitted the place of their long captivity;\r\nBarents, before they set out, drawing up in writing a list of their\r\nnames, with a brief record of their experiences, and depositing it in\r\nthe wooden hut. He himself was so reduced with sickness, want, and\r\nanxiety that he was unable to stand, and had to be carried into the\r\nboat. On the 16th, the captain, hailing from the other boat, inquired\r\nhow the pilot fared. “Quite well, mate,” Barents replied; “I still hope\r\nto mend before we get to Wardhouse,”--Wardhouse being an island on the\r\ncoast of Lapland. But he died on the 19th (or, as some authorities say,\r\non the 20th), to the great grief of his comrades, who appreciated his\r\nmanly character, and placed great reliance on his experience and skill.\r\n\r\nThe adventurers met with many difficulties from the ice,--sometimes\r\nbeing carried out far from the ice-belt, and at others being compelled\r\nto haul the boats for long distances over the rough surface of the\r\nfloes to reach open water. It has been well observed that there are\r\nmany instances on record of long ocean-voyages performed in open boats,\r\nbut that, perhaps, not one is of so extraordinary a character as that\r\nwhich we are describing,--when two small and crazy craft ventured to\r\ncross the frozen seas for eleven hundred miles, continually endangered\r\nby huge floating ice-masses, threatened by bears, and exposed for forty\r\ndays to the combined trials of sickness, famine, cold, and fatigue.\r\n\r\nAt length they arrived at Kola, in Lapland, towards the end of August;\r\nand, strangely enough, were taken on board a Dutch vessel commanded by\r\nthe very Cornelizoon Rijp who had commanded the sister discovery-ship\r\nin the previous year. They reached the Maas in safety in October 1597.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo voyager appears to have sailed in the track of Barents, or, at all\r\nevents, to have visited the place where he wintered, until 1871. No\r\none but he had rounded the north-east point of bleak Novaia Zemlaia.\r\nIn 1869, however, and on the 16th of May, Captain Carlsen, a Norwegian\r\nof much experience in the North Sea trade, sailed from Hammerfest in a\r\nsloop of sixty tons, called the _Solid_. On the 7th of September\r\nhe reached Ice Haven, and on the 9th discovered a rude wooden house\r\nstanding at the head of the bay. Its dimensions were 32 feet by 20,\r\nand it was constructed of planks measuring from 14 to 16 inches in\r\nbreadth, and 1½ inches thick. These, it was evident, had belonged to\r\na ship, and amongst them were several oak beams. Heaps of bones of\r\nseal, bear, reindeer, and walrus, as well as several large puncheons,\r\nwere collected round the hut. It was the winter-prison of Barents and\r\nhis companions, and had never been entered by human foot since they\r\nhad abandoned it. The cooking-pans stood over the fireplace, the old\r\nclock hung against the wall; there were the books, and implements, and\r\ntools, and weapons which had been of so much service two hundred and\r\nseventy-eight years before. It was an Arctic reproduction of the legend\r\nof the hundred years’ sleep of the fairy princess.\r\n\r\nCaptain Carlsen gives the following list of articles found in the lone\r\nhut on the shore of Novaia Zemlaia:--\r\n\r\n   Iron frame over the fireplace, with shifting bar; two ship\r\n   cooking-pans of copper, found standing on the iron frame, with\r\n   the remains of a copper scoop; copper bands, probably at one\r\n   time fastened round pails; bar of iron; iron crowbar; one long\r\n   and two small gun-barrels; two bores or augers, each three\r\n   feet in length; chisel, padlock, caulking-iron, three gouges,\r\n   and six files; plate of zinc; earthenware jar; tankard, with\r\n   zinc lid; lower half of another tankard; six fragments of\r\n   pepper-pots; tin meat-strainer; pair of boots; sword; fragments\r\n   of old engravings, with Latin couplets underneath them; three\r\n   Dutch books; a small piece of metal; nineteen cartridge cases,\r\n   some still full of powder; iron chest, with lid, and intricate\r\n   lock-work; fragments of metal handle of same; grindstone; an\r\n   eight-pound iron weight; small cannon-ball; gun-lock, with\r\n   hammer and flint; clock, bell of clock, and striker; rasp; small\r\n   auger; small narrow strips of copper band; two salt and pepper\r\n   pots, about eight inches high; two pairs of compasses; fragment\r\n   of iron-handled knife; three spoons; borer; hone; one wooden,\r\n   and one bronze tap; two wooden stoppers for gun muzzles; two\r\n   spear or ice-pole heads; four navigation instruments; a flute;\r\n   lock and key; another lock; sledge-hammer head; clock weight;\r\n   twenty-six pewter candlesticks and fragments, six in a complete\r\n   state of preservation; pitcher of Etruscan shape, beautifully\r\n   engraved; upper half of another pitcher; wooden trencher,\r\n   coloured red; clock alarum; three scales; four medallions,\r\n   circular, about eight inches in diameter, three of them mounted\r\n   in oak frames; a string of buttons; hilt of sword, and a foot of\r\n   its blade; halberd head; and two carved pieces of wood, one with\r\n   the haft of a knife in it.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of September Captain Carlsen sailed from the Ice Haven,\r\nand kept along the east coast of Novaia Zemlaia, encountering bad\r\nweather and contrary winds, but succeeding in his chief object, the\r\ncircumnavigation of the island, which he accomplished on the 6th of\r\nOctober. He returned to Hammerfest early in November.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur chronological summary now brings us to the Austrian Polar\r\nexpedition of 1872. The command was intrusted to Lieutenant Payer, an\r\naccomplished seaman who had served under Captain Koldewey; Carlsen was\r\nengaged as pilot; and the steamer _Tegethoff_ was carefully and\r\nabundantly equipped for the voyage. The plan laid down by Lieutenant\r\nPayer was well-conceived; namely, to round the north-eastern point of\r\nNovaia Zemlaia, and sail eastward until he made the extreme north of\r\nSiberia, where he proposed to winter. In the spring, travelling-parties\r\nwould be sent out on exploring journeys; and the voyage, in summer,\r\nwould be continued as far as Behring Strait.\r\n\r\nThe _Tegethoff_ steamed out of Tromsö Harbour on the 13th of\r\nJuly; first fell in with the ice on the 25th, in lat. 74° 15’ N.; and\r\non the 29th sighted the coast of Novaia Zemlaia. Here she was caught\r\nin the pack; but steam being got up, repeated charges were made at\r\nthe enemy, and she was carried bravely into an open water-way, about\r\ntwenty miles wide, to the north of the Matochkia Strait. On the 12th\r\nof August she was joined by the _Isbyörn_ yacht, with Count\r\nWilczck and some friends on board. The two vessels anchored close to\r\nthe shore, in lat. 76° 30’ N., and on the 18th celebrated the Emperor\r\nof Austria’s birthday. Daily excursions were made by sledge-parties\r\nto the adjoining islands, resulting in an accumulation of botanical\r\nand geological specimens, besides slaughtered bears and foxes, and\r\nquantities of drift-wood. On the 23rd the vessels parted company,--the\r\n_Tegethoff_ steaming to the northward, and the _Isbyörn_\r\nendeavouring to push southward along the coast. On reaching the mouth\r\nof the Petchora, Count Wilczck and his friends left her to proceed on\r\nthe return voyage to Tromsö, while they ascended the Petchora in small\r\nboats to Perm, and returned to Vienna by way of Moscow.\r\n\r\nThe _Tegethoff_ spent the winters of 1872 and 1873 in the Icy Sea,\r\nand made some discoveries of interest. It returned in safety in the\r\nsummer of 1874.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1871 an American expedition was fitted out under the command of\r\nCaptain Charles Francis Hall, who had already gained distinction by\r\nhis explorations in the Polar regions and his long residence among the\r\nEskimos. Through the liberality of Mr. Grinnell, assisted by the United\r\nStates Government, he was provided with a stout and well-found steamer,\r\nthe _Polaris_, which sailed from Brooklyn on the 29th of June. She\r\ncarried a crew of seventeen officers and men,--Mr. Buddington being\r\nsailing and ice master, and Mr. Tyson assistant navigator,--besides six\r\nadult Eskimos and two children; and a scientific staff consisting of\r\nDr. Emil Bessel, Mr. Bryan, and Mr. Frederick Meyers.\r\n\r\nA few days previous to the sailing of the expedition, Mr. Grinnell\r\npresented Hall with the historic flag which Lieutenant Wilkes, in 1838,\r\nhad borne nearer to the South Pole than any American flag had been\r\nbefore,--which Lieutenant De Haven, and afterwards Dr. Kane, and lastly\r\nDr. Hayes, had carried further north than any other ensign. Captain\r\nHall, in receiving it, expressed his conviction that, in the spring of\r\n1872, “it would float over a new world, in which the North Pole Star is\r\nthe crowning jewel.”\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of July the _Polaris_ entered the land-locked\r\nharbour of St. John’s, Newfoundland, where she remained a week while\r\nher machinery underwent some repairs. Then she proceeded north to\r\nHolsteinberg, in Greenland; but failed in procuring a supply of coal\r\nor a stock of reindeer furs, both of which were much desiderated. On\r\nthe 4th of August she arrived at the Danish settlement of Godhaven, and\r\nhappily found the United States steamer _Congress_, which had been\r\ndespatched with extra stores and supplies. Thence she steamed northward\r\nto Upernavik, which was reached on the 18th. So far her progress seemed\r\nto have been peculiarly fortunate; but already dissensions had broken\r\nout among the officers, which augured ill for the eventual success of\r\nthe expedition. In his despatches home, however, Captain Hall made\r\nno allusion to this discouraging circumstance; and his biographer\r\nexplains this silence by “his idiosyncrasy, which enabled him to sink\r\neverything else in the one idea of pushing on to the far north.”\r\n\r\nUpernavik, with its little colony of Danish officials and Eskimo\r\nnatives, was left behind on the 21st of August, and the _Polaris_\r\ncontinued her adventurous course. Six days later, she arrived at Kane’s\r\nwinter-quarters in 1853–55, and at the point where he abandoned his\r\nlittle vessel, the _Advance_. Next day her crew found a huge\r\nwall of ice in front of them, and doubled round it by steering to\r\nthe west-north-west. Then again putting their vessel’s head to the\r\nnorthward, they made their way up Kennedy Channel, and gained the\r\nthreshold of what Dr. Kane had supposed to be the Open Polar Sea. They\r\ndiscovered, however, that it was bounded by land on either side, with\r\na vast expanse of ice stretching far beyond it. Careful observation\r\nshowed that it was, in reality, a _bay_, which Kane had mistaken\r\nfor the open sea when its land-boundaries were hidden by fog. It is\r\nabout forty-five miles wide.\r\n\r\nThence they entered a channel similar to that of Kennedy, which\r\nmeasured about seventeen miles in breadth, and was obstructed by heavy\r\nice. Their progress now was slow and difficult, and many of the crew\r\nwore rueful countenances, as if they were going “to sail off the edge\r\nof the world.” A more serious obstacle was the timidity of Captain\r\nBuddington, who showed himself opposed to pushing further northward.\r\nHall, therefore, resolved to carry the steamer in-shore, land some of\r\nhis stores, and prepare for wintering at this advanced point of “Ultima\r\nThule.”\r\n\r\nAt midnight, on the 4th of September, Captain Hall raised an American\r\nflag on this land, the northernmost site on which any civilized flag\r\nhad been planted. When it was waving in the breeze, he proclaimed that\r\nhe took possession of the surrounding region of snow and ice “in the\r\nname of the Lord, and for the President of the United States.” He then\r\nreturned on board the _Polaris_, and her anchor was let go. The\r\nplace was only a bend in the coast, and afforded no protection as a\r\nharbour; they therefore steamed through the open water, and searched\r\nfurther to the southward; but finding no more sheltered quarters, they\r\nreturned to their former anchorage, and began to land provisions,--the\r\nwind moaning sadly, and the snow falling in heavy showers.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th, they weighed anchor and steamed in nearer to the shore;\r\nbringing the ship round behind an iceberg, which lay aground in\r\nthirteen fathoms of water. This huge mass of ice proved to be about 450\r\nfeet in length, 300 feet in breadth, and 60 feet in height; lat 81°\r\n38’ N., long. 61° 45’ W. The berg was named “Providence Berg,” and the\r\ncove in which they had established themselves, “Thank God Harbour.”\r\nOn surveying the surrounding country they found nothing calculated to\r\nbrighten the prospects of the coming winter. The coast-hills rose from\r\nnine to thirteen hundred feet in height, and were furrowed and scarred\r\nwith great cracks and fissures, which bore witness to the rough usage\r\nof frost and ice, wind and weather. To the south lay a large glacier,\r\nwhich swept round in a wide circuit, and fell into the bay immediately\r\nnorth of their anchorage. Traces of Eskimos were discernible here and\r\nthere; circles of stones, indicating where they had pitched their\r\ntents. The landscape was all of a dull neutral tint, a kind of cold\r\ngray; for, as yet, the winter snow had not clothed it with its mantle\r\nof dazzling whiteness. For this, however, the adventurers had not long\r\nto wait. A snow-storm began on the 27th of September, and lasted for\r\nsix-and-thirty hours.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FUNERAL OF CAPTAIN HALL.]\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of October Captain Hall organized a sledging expedition,\r\nas a preliminary to an extended journey in the spring. There were two\r\nsledges, each drawn by seven dogs; Captain Hall and Eskimo Joe in\r\none sledge, and Mr. Chester and Eskimo Hans in the other. They were\r\nabsent until the 24th, but owing to the roughness of the ice had\r\naccomplished only fifty miles, and had made no discovery.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the crew had been engaged in banking up the ice around the\r\nship, in order to protect it from collision with drifting floes;\r\nthe deck was partly roofed over, and covered with canvas; and other\r\npreparations were made to resist the terrible inclemency of an Arctic\r\nwinter. These, however, were temporarily suspended by the sudden\r\nillness of Captain Hall. On the 1st of November he was a little better,\r\nbut on the 3rd his malady, which appears to have been a form of\r\nparalysis, took a turn for the worse; and the end came so rapidly that\r\nthe eager-hearted, enthusiastic explorer, who had braved so many harsh\r\nexperiences in the Polar World, “fell asleep” early on the morning of\r\nthe 8th. A grave was immediately prepared for the reception of his\r\nremains about half a mile inland; a shallow grave, for the ground was\r\nfrozen so hard that it was scarcely possible to break it up, even with\r\npicks; and on the 11th, the funeral took place. The time chosen was\r\nhalf-past eleven in the morning; yet it was so dark that Mr. Bryan\r\nread prayers by the light “of a lantern dimly burning.” All the ship’s\r\ncompany were present. The coffin was hauled on a sledge, over which, by\r\nway of pall, was spread the American flag with its stars and stripes.\r\nThe captain and officers, Dr. Bessel, and Mr. Meyers, followed as\r\nmourners; and strange and picturesque must the melancholy procession\r\nhave appeared, as it wound its way through ice and snow, while a weird\r\nboreal light or gleam in the air revealed the outlines of the distant\r\nhills, rising like a rampart on the edge of the snow-covered plain, and\r\nflickered every now and then over the frozen expanse of the ice-bound\r\nbay.\r\n\r\nThus, says Captain Tyson, thus ended poor Hall’s ambitious projects;\r\nthus was stilled the effervescing enthusiasm of his ardent nature.\r\n“Wise he might not always have been, but his soul was in his work; and\r\nhad he lived till spring, I think he would have gone as far as mortal\r\nman could go to accomplish his mission. But with his death, I fear that\r\nall hopes of further progress will have to be abandoned.” That Tyson\r\nwas right in his conjecture, our narrative will show.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCaptain Buddington succeeded to the command, and one of his first\r\nmeasures was to discontinue the Sunday service, for reasons which he\r\ndoes not seem to have explained, and we are unable to imagine. So far\r\nas we can gather from the published records of the expedition, he was\r\na man unfitted to bear responsibility,--a man without enthusiasm in\r\nhimself, and incapable, therefore, of stimulating it in others. Nor\r\ncould he secure the obedience of his inferiors. Seamen are always\r\nprompt to detect the weakness of their officers; and the crew of the\r\n_Polaris_ soon assured themselves that their new captain was\r\ndeficient both in courage and resolution.\r\n\r\nHowever, the winter gradually closed in upon the little ice-bound\r\ncompany of the _Polaris_, and they were called upon to endure,\r\nwith such patience as was at their command, the severities of the\r\nlong Arctic night. It was very dark, yet not totally dark. For an\r\nhour or two at noon it was possible to wander a short distance from\r\nthe snow-roofed vessel; but, once away from it, the gloom and silence\r\nof everything around settled down on the wanderer like a pall. There\r\nwere none of the usual sounds of Nature to relieve the deep oppression\r\nof the scene. “The other evening,” says Tyson, “I had wandered away\r\nfrom the ship, disgusted with the confusion and noise, and longing for\r\na moment’s quiet. Once beyond range of the men’s voices, there was\r\nabsolutely no other sound whatever. It was quite calm--no wind, no\r\nmovement of any living creature; nothing but a leaden sky above, ice\r\nbeneath my feet, and _silence everywhere_. It hung like a pall\r\nover everything. So painfully oppressive did it become at last, that I\r\nwas frequently tempted to shout aloud, to break the spell. At last I\r\ndid; but no response came, not even an echo.\r\n\r\n    ‘The space was void; there I stood,\r\n    And the sole spectre was the solitude.’”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: AN ARCTIC SNOW-STORM.]\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of January 1872, it is recorded that eighty days had elapsed\r\nsince the adventurers had seen the sun. The internal economy of the\r\n_Polaris_, meantime, was pitiably disorganized. There was no\r\ndiscipline, no order, no method. The men did what they pleased, and\r\nconsequently made night hideous by their prolonged carousals. The\r\nofficers disagreed among themselves, and the object of the expedition\r\nappeared to have been lost sight of, or no longer to excite any deep\r\nor permanent interest. It was even discussed as a proper and probable\r\ncourse to abandon the proposed northward exploration, and, as soon as\r\nthe ice broke up, to make all haste back to New York.\r\n\r\nEarly in February, the daylight began to gain upon the night a little,\r\nand the Eskimos hunted for seals, as they could be heard under the\r\nice making their breathing holes. Storms were very frequent--storms\r\nwhich drove the snow afar in dense, blinding clouds; and false moons\r\nand other atmospheric phenomena attracted the attention of the curious\r\nobserver. On the 28th, after an absence of one hundred and thirty-five\r\ndays, the sun reappeared; and never was royal guest more eagerly\r\nwelcomed by a loyal people. Its rays seemed to bring with them a\r\npromise of new life. Men’s hearts grew lighter in spite of themselves,\r\nand all felt as if they had been relieved from a heavy and intolerable\r\nburden. Not that the temperature showed any perceptible difference. The\r\nthermometer indicated 37° below zero on the 1st of March!\r\n\r\nPassing over a couple of months which present no incidents of\r\nimportance, we find that on the 9th of May the monotonous dulness of\r\nthe expedition was broken by a sledge-journey to the north, undertaken\r\nby Captain Tyson, with Meyers, Joe, and Hans as companions. They were\r\nabsent from the ship six days; striking inland, in an east-north-east\r\ndirection, to Newman Bay, and thence keeping more to the north, until\r\nthey reached lat. 82° 9’. Mr. Meyers surveyed the shores of Newman Bay,\r\nand Captain Tyson endeavoured to secure some game. One day they came\r\non a large herd of musk-oxen. These animals act very curiously when an\r\nattack is made upon them. They form a circle, stern to stern, and await\r\nthe assault of their enemies. The dogs surround them, and keep them at\r\nbay. Not unfrequently a dog gets tossed. Though Joe and the captain\r\nfired and reloaded as fast as they could, the poor brutes offered no\r\nresistance; but when eight had fallen, the remainder took to flight.\r\nThe slaughtered oxen were then flayed, and the best pieces cut up for\r\nconveyance to the ship.\r\n\r\nThese cattle develop their great size and weight on what might be\r\nsupposed to form a very slender diet. Their food is the mosses and\r\nlichens which grow on the rocks; and to obtain it, they must first\r\nscrape away the snow with their hoofs. At the first sign of danger, the\r\ncalves shelter themselves under their parents’ body; and their hair is\r\nso long as to afford the young a very complete and satisfactory screen.\r\nThe musk-ox is an animal of considerable bulk. Several of those shot by\r\nTyson and the Eskimos weighed from 500 to 600 lbs. each. In proportion\r\nto their size and weight, their legs are very short.\r\n\r\nEarly in June, Captain Buddington resolved to despatch a couple of\r\nboats, for the purpose of exploring the neighbouring coast, and\r\ndiscovering, if possible, an open water channel to the north. One\r\nof these was placed under the command of Mr. Chester; the other, of\r\nCaptain Tyson. Mr. Chester’s boat was nipped in an ice-floe, and\r\ncrushed to pieces. The crew escaped with difficulty, but the historical\r\nflag was lost. Captain Tyson pushed forward to Newman Bay, where some\r\neider-ducks, gulls, and dove-kies were shot. Joined by Mr. Chester--who\r\nhad returned to the ship, and secured the safety-boat--he found his\r\nfurther progress arrested by that compact, insuperable field of ice\r\nwhich is the despair of Arctic navigators. All attempts to get further\r\nto the north proved in vain; and orders to return having arrived from\r\nCaptain Buddington, there was nothing to be done but to rejoin the\r\n_Polaris_.\r\n\r\nThe summer passed away, and still the _Polaris_ lay beset among\r\nthe ice; or, rather, drifted slowly to the southward, along with the\r\nfloe to which it was attached. No sledge-expeditions were organized;\r\nand Captain Buddington’s sole concern was to watch for an opportunity\r\nof getting out into the open channel, and returning to New York. Some\r\nslight progress southward was occasionally made; but towards the end\r\nof October it became evident that the explorers would have to spend a\r\nsecond winter in their frozen captivity. They had been carried beyond\r\nRensselaer Harbour, where Dr. Kane wintered during 1853–55, and began\r\nthe construction of a store-house for provisions, in case the ship\r\nshould be endangered by the drifting ice.\r\n\r\nThis dreaded catastrophe did indeed occur, on the night of the 15th.\r\nThe pressure of the floe was tremendous, but the _Polaris_ bore\r\nit bravely, though groaning and creaking in every timber. After awhile,\r\nhowever, it was found that she had started a leak aft, and that the\r\nwater was gaining on the pumps. The discovery seems to have startled\r\nBuddington out of all coolness or reflection. He threw up his arms,\r\nand cried out to “throw everything on the ice.” Immediately all was\r\nchaos. The men seized whatever lay near to their hands, and threw it\r\noverboard. A quantity of stores had been previously placed on the deck,\r\nin anticipation of such an event; but these were now hurled on the floe\r\nin indiscriminate confusion, and with considerable loss. Captain Tyson\r\nand some of the men got overboard, with the view of arranging things\r\nin, at least, a semblance of order; but while he was thus engaged, the\r\nice commenced cracking. Shortly afterwards it exploded under his feet,\r\nand broke in many places; the ship drove away in the darkness, and\r\nTyson and his companions immediately lost sight of her.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a terrible night. The wind blew a hurricane, and the snow fell\r\nheavily in drifting, whirling masses. “We did not know,” says Tyson,\r\n“who was on the ice, or who was on the ship;” but seeing some musk-ox\r\nskins lying across a wide crack in the ice, he pulled them towards him\r\nto save them--and behold, rolled up in one of them were two or three of\r\nthe children of Hans the Eskimo! Some of the men were afloat on small\r\npieces of ice, but by means of the whale-boat these were rescued; and\r\nwhen the gray light of morning dawned on the scene, Tyson ascertained\r\nthat eighteen persons, besides himself, were castaways. These were--Mr.\r\nMeyers, meteorologist; Heron, steward; Jackson, cook; six seamen; Joe\r\nand Hans, the Eskimos, and their wives and children.\r\n\r\nThe piece of the floe on which they were cast was nearly circular,\r\nand about four miles in circumference. It was not level, but full of\r\nhillocks, and of ponds or small lakes, which had been formed by the\r\nmelting of the ice during the short summer. The ice varied greatly in\r\nthickness. Some of the mounds, or hills, were probably thirty feet\r\nthick; the flat parts not more than ten or fifteen. The surface was\r\nexceedingly rugged, and the hummocks were white with snow.\r\n\r\nTyson’s first task was to inspect the stock of provisions that had\r\nbeen collected on the floe. It consisted of fourteen cans of pemmican,\r\neleven and a half bags of bread, one can of dried apples, and fourteen\r\nhams; and if the ship did not return for them, they might have to\r\nsupport themselves upon this supply all through the dreary winter,\r\nor die of starvation. Fortunately, they had a couple of boats; and\r\nTyson’s second care was to load these, embark his little company, and\r\nendeavour to reach the shore. In this attempt they were balked by the\r\ndrifting ice; and before they could repeat it they caught sight of\r\nthe _Polaris_. Immediately they ran up a rough and ready signal;\r\nbut no one seemed to be keeping a look-out, and the castaways had the\r\nmortification of seeing her drop away behind Littleton Island, without\r\nundertaking any search for her missing crew.\r\n\r\nTyson therefore resolved to cross to the other side of the floe, and\r\nmake for the land, perhaps lower down than the _Polaris_ was, so\r\nas to intercept her. Everything was thrown away, except two or three\r\ndays’ provisions, and the boats were got ready. But the men were slow\r\nand reluctant; oars were wanting; a violent gale arose; and as night\r\nwas coming on, Tyson found himself compelled to abandon his intention.\r\nOn the following day, the ice again broke; and now the adventurers were\r\ndrifting with one boat on one piece of ice, while the other boat, a\r\npart of their provisions, and an extemporized hut of poles, remained on\r\nthe main part of the original floe. The ice-raft which carried Tyson\r\nand his companions measured about 150 yards each way.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE CASTAWAYS ON THE ICE.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ADRIFT ON THE ICE-FLOE.]\r\n\r\nOn the 21st, however, the boat and provisions were recovered. Joe,\r\nwith the keen eye of an Eskimo, caught sight of the bow of the boat,\r\nprojecting from a fragment of the broken ice. Followed by his faithful\r\nally, Tyson went in search of it, leaping like a chamois-hunter\r\nfrom crag to crag. Six of the dogs had accompanied him. These were\r\nharnessed to the boat, and with the help of sturdy arms dragged it\r\nover the disrupted floe. The whole party then removed to the large\r\nfloe, where some snow-houses were speedily erected. They formed quite\r\nan encampment: one hut, or rather a sort of half-hut, for Mr. Meyers\r\nand Captain Tyson; Joe’s hut for himself, his wife, and their adopted\r\ndaughter; a hut for the men; a store-house for provisions, and a\r\ncook-house,--all united by arched galleries, built of consolidated\r\nsnow, with one main entrance, and smaller ones branching off to the\r\nseveral apartments or huts. Hans built his _igloë_ separately,\r\nbut close by. All were constructed after the Eskimo fashion--that is,\r\nthe ground being levelled off, one half of the floor toward the end\r\nfurthest from the entrance was slightly raised above the other or front\r\nhalf. The raised part, as we have previously explained, serves as\r\nparlour and bedroom; the lower area, as workshop and kitchen. The walls\r\nand arched roof were built up of square blocks of hard snow, packed\r\nhard and close by the force of the wind. A square of about eighteen\r\ninches of this compressed snow or ice served for window.\r\n\r\nThis good work done, Tyson took stock. Successive expeditions\r\nhad gathered together nearly all that was on the ice when the\r\n_Polaris_ drifted from them, and he found that their stores\r\nincluded two boats--one of which, however, was being broken up for\r\nfuel--and one kayack, a good supply of powder and shot, eleven and a\r\nhalf bags of bread, fourteen cans of pemmican, fourteen hams, ten dozen\r\ncans of meats and soups, one can of dried apples, and about twenty\r\npounds of chocolate and sugar mixed. The pemmican cases were large,\r\neach weighing forty-five pounds; the meats and soups were only one and\r\ntwo pound cans; the hams were small; the dried-apple can counted for\r\ntwenty-two pounds. Evidently, when divided among nineteen people, this\r\nsupply could not last many weeks; and unless they reached the land, or\r\ncould catch seals, starvation seemed their probable ultimate fate. The\r\nallowance was reduced to eleven ounces for each adult, and half that\r\namount for the children,--rations painfully inadequate to the proper\r\nsupport of the human frame in a Polar region and during an Arctic\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: RECOVERY OF THE BOAT BY CAPTAIN TYSON.]\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of October they lost sight of the sun. At this time they\r\nwere about eight or ten miles off-shore, and forty to fifty miles west\r\nof Northumberland Island, in lat. 77° 30’ nearly. The Eskimos were on\r\nthe watch for seals day after day, but without success. In truth, it\r\nis not easy to find the seal in winter, as they live principally under\r\nthe ice, and can be seen only when it cracks. A warm-blooded animal, it\r\ncannot always remain beneath the frozen surface without breathing, and\r\nfor this purpose they make air-holes through the ice and snow. These,\r\nhowever, are so small at the surface, not exceeding two and a half\r\ninches across, that they are not easily distinguished, especially in\r\nthe twilight-gloom of an Arctic winter day.\r\n\r\nThe floe, or ice-raft, on which the crew of the _Polaris_ had\r\nfound shelter, continued to drift slowly to the southward, impelled\r\nby wind and current. The weather was so severe that it was worse than\r\nuseless to attempt to reach the shore. The castaways therefore huddled\r\nthemselves together in their _igloes_, or huts of snow, or took\r\nsuch diversion as hunting for fox or seal afforded. Or when a gleam of\r\nfair weather afforded an opportunity, Tyson took a short drive in his\r\nsledge, and explored as much as he dared of the ice lying towards the\r\nshore. On the 1st of November an attempt was made to reach the land,\r\nthe dogs being harnessed to the sledge, and the boat loaded with the\r\nmost essential articles; but the state of the ice rendered all efforts\r\nof this kind fruitless.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: IGLOES CONSTRUCTED BY THE CASTAWAYS.]\r\n\r\nOne day, Joe and Hans, the Eskimos, went out in quest of game. In\r\nwandering through the hummocks they lost one another, and Joe, after\r\ntrying his luck alone, made his way back towards the hut before night\r\ncame on; he fully anticipated to find that Hans had preceded him, and\r\nwas much alarmed when he heard that he had not returned. Accompanied\r\nby Robert, he started in search of him. As they sped along through the\r\nrapidly-gathering darkness, they saw what appeared to be a Polar bear\r\napproaching them; loaded their pistols, and prepared to give him a\r\nwarm reception, when, fortunately, the creature throwing up his arms,\r\nand standing erect, they perceived that it was their missing comrade.\r\nHe had used both hands and feet in climbing the rough hummocks, and\r\nhis fur clothing being covered with snow, the deception was tolerably\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of November, Captain Tyson writes in his diary: “We\r\nare living now on as little as the human frame can endure without\r\nsuccumbing; some tremble with weakness when they try to walk. Mr.\r\nMeyers suffers much from this cause; he was not well when he came on\r\nthe ice, and the regimen here has not improved him. He lives with the\r\nmen now; they are mostly Germans, and so is he, and the affinity of\r\nblood draws them together, I suppose. Since he has housed with the\r\nmen, I have lived in the hut with Joe, Hannah, and Puney. Puney, poor\r\nchild, is often hungry; indeed, all the children often cry with hunger.\r\nWe give them all that it is safe to use. I can do no more, however\r\nsorry I may feel for them.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut it is unnecessary to trace the misfortunes and sufferings\r\nof Captain Tyson’s little company day by day. Their wretched\r\ncondition--adrift on a raft of ice, insufficiently clothed,\r\ninsufficiently fed, poorly housed, without any of the comforts that\r\ngenerally make an Arctic expedition endurable, buffeted by snow-storm\r\nand tempest, in constant apprehension lest their insecure raft\r\nshould break up--requires no exaggeration of colouring to produce\r\nits full impression on the reader. In January 1873, it was found\r\nthat the provisions were diminishing with terrible rapidity; and\r\nthis was due not so much to the regular daily consumption as to the\r\nsecret pilferings of the crew, who were not controlled by any bonds\r\nof discipline, and yielded Captain Tyson an imperfect and reluctant\r\nobedience. They were all Germans, except Heron, an Englishman, and\r\nthe cook, a man of colour, and their conduct was a disgrace to their\r\nnationality. They seem to have thought that their raft was carrying\r\nthem swiftly towards Disco in Greenland, where abundant supplies could\r\neasily be obtained; but, in truth, they were drifting in the direction\r\nof Labrador, and the safety of all demanded the sternest economy of\r\ntheir small stock of provisions.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: HANS MISTAKEN FOR A BEAR.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DIFFICULT TRAVELLING.]\r\n\r\nThe cold was now excessive,--35° below zero at noon, and 37° at\r\nmidnight. On the 13th, it sank below 40°. On the following day,\r\nhowever, a strong westerly gale blew up; the cold became more\r\nmoderate--the temperature rose to -14°. Under the influence of the\r\ngale, the ice began to crack and grind and break up; the natives\r\nlaunched a kayack; a seal was hunted down, and the castaways feasted\r\ngloriously. This, however, was but a transient gleam of good fortune.\r\nOn the 17th the glass again sank to 38°, and no more seals were\r\nvisible. The men were now reduced to less than twelve ounces of food\r\ndaily, which was not sufficient to furnish internal warmth, or to\r\nstrengthen the system against the terrible effects of the Arctic\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nThe 19th was, to some extent, a day of hope; for, after an absence of\r\neighty-three days, the sun once more rose above the misty horizon.\r\nEskimo Joe took advantage of the burst of daylight to undertake a\r\nhunting expedition. About five miles from the hut he found open water,\r\nand shot two seals, but could land only one; the young ice carried the\r\nother away. Encouraged by the cheerful glow of the sun, he stayed out\r\nlater than usual, and it was very dark before he returned. A light of\r\nburning blubber was kindled to guide him to the hut. It shone out upon\r\nthe gloom of the night like a pharos.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE GUIDING LIGHT.]\r\n\r\nThe 25th of January marked the one hundred and third day of the\r\ncastaways’ voyage on the ice-raft, and they severely felt the\r\nmonotonous wretchedness of their existence. It was a beautiful day,\r\nand perfectly calm; but the thermometer indicated 40° below zero.\r\nAt midnight the heavens were illuminated with all the glories of a\r\nbrilliant aurora. They seemed to be ablaze: from the south-west to\r\nthe north-east, from the horizon to the zenith, the magnetic fires\r\nshot here and there, and wavered and undulated, like flame driven by a\r\nstrong wind. At one time the splendour was almost overpowering, and the\r\nstraining eye was fain to seek relief in darkness.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of February a violent gale arose, blowing from the\r\nnorth-west, and the ice, rolling and rocking beneath its influence,\r\nsplit up into great cracks and fissures which threatened the safety of\r\nthe castaways. Huge blocks fell off from the floe; and the vast bergs\r\nwhich had hitherto accompanied, and partly sheltered it, moved rapidly\r\nbefore the wind. Everything acknowledged the might of the storm; but\r\nas yet the adventurers had not been disturbed, though surrounded by\r\nmountains of ice heavy enough, if driven against their encampment,\r\nto have crushed them to atoms. Thus far they had floated safely, but\r\nthe position was one to cause reflection: at some time or other the\r\nice must break up, they knew; but whether they would survive the\r\ncatastrophe was beyond conjecture. They could only wait and hope.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DRAGGING A SEAL.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere is a picture of the interior of one of the _igloes_, or\r\nsnow-huts:--\r\n\r\n“Joe and Hannah are sitting in front of the lamp, playing checkers\r\non an old piece of canvas, the squares being marked out with Tyson’s\r\npencil. They use buttons for men, as they have nothing better. The\r\nnatives easily learn any sort of game; some of them can even play a\r\nrespectable game of chess; and cards they understand as well as the\r\n‘heathen Chinee.’ Cards go wherever sailors go, and the first lessons\r\nthat the natives of any uncivilized country get are usually from\r\nsailors.\r\n\r\n“Little Puney, Joe and Hannah’s adopted child, a little girl, is\r\nsitting wrapped in a musk-ox skin; every few minutes she says to her\r\nmother, ‘I am _so_ hungry!’ The children often cry with hunger. It\r\nmakes one’s heart ache, but they are obliged to bear it with the rest.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe gale continued on the 2nd, with blinding showers of snow--fine,\r\npenetrating, pungent. Next day the weather moderated, and the glass\r\nrose to 15° below zero. Dark clouds lowered in the horizon, preventing\r\nthe land from being seen, if any shore were near. But the rapid rise\r\nin the temperature, after so strong a north-west gale, allowed Tyson\r\nto hope that the wind had mastered the current, and was forcing them\r\ntowards the Greenland shore.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: RETURN OF THE SUN.]\r\n\r\nThough all around nothing was visible but ice and icebergs, the scene\r\nhad a certain beauty of its own--a strange weird beauty, like that\r\nof a dream-picture. When the sun shone on the bergs, and lighted up\r\ntheir massive or fantastic forms, all the prismatic colours of the\r\nrainbow flashed through the “crystal pendants” or “projecting peaks.”\r\nThe interest of the scene was enhanced by the variety of its forms.\r\nEvery berg appeared to have had its individual history, and its broken\r\noutline and furrowed surface bore witness to the experiences it had\r\nundergone--storm and rain, wind and water. Some rose up around the\r\ncastaways like solid ramparts; others represented the spire of a Gothic\r\ncathedral, the pinnacle of a Turkish minaret, the glittering walls of a\r\npalace: all were beautiful, yet terrible in their beauty, conveying a\r\nprofound feeling of might and destructive power.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SHOOTING NARWHAL.]\r\n\r\nOn the 5th, and again on the 7th, a seal was caught, and the little\r\ncompany enjoyed a plentiful meal. On the latter day a couple of\r\nnarwhals were shot, but both sank before they could be reached. These\r\nnarwhals are sometimes called sea-unicorns, or monodons, in allusion\r\nto the long horn, six to eight feet in measurement--or, rather, the\r\nelongated tooth--which projects from the upper jaw; a formidable\r\nweapon, tapering from base to point, with a spiral twist from left to\r\nright. Strange stories were told of these sea-unicorns by the early\r\nnavigators; but science has made short work of legend and fable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDay after day, the history of _our_ navigators was the same; no\r\nstirring romance, but harsh reality:--wind and snow, snow and wind--a\r\nwind which almost froze the life-blood of those exposed to it, and\r\nsnow which fell so fast and thick as to wrap the scene in the gloom of\r\ndesolation. Still, the ice-raft drifted southward; slowly but surely\r\ndrifted through the darkness of the night and the twilight obscurity\r\nof the day; while the little company it carried suffered much from\r\nincreasing weakness, though better provided with food than formerly,\r\nowing to the frequent capture of narwhal and seal. Occasionally the\r\nmists cleared off, and the sun streamed out in meridian splendour,\r\nlighting up every feature of the “ice-scape”--may we coin the\r\nword?--around them. But, too frequently, “snow and blow, blow and\r\nsnow,” was, as Tyson remarks, “the order of the day.”\r\n\r\nHope lives eternal in the human breast; and though it had sunk very low\r\nin the hearts of our adventurers, it suddenly rekindled on the 19th\r\nof February, when they caught sight of the west coast, at no greater\r\ndistance than thirty-eight or forty miles. Its flame was kept alive on\r\nthe 21st by the discovery that the thermometer had risen to 3° above\r\nzero. Next day it had risen to 20°, or within 12° of freezing-point;\r\nand men inured to the rigour of an Arctic winter spoke of such weather\r\nwith cheeriness as “very comfortable.” The cloud upon the prospect now\r\nwas the want of food, for the game had begun to fail. The hunters went\r\nforth every morning, but returned empty-handed. The feebleness of the\r\nparty increased in an alarming degree. It took several men to carry a\r\nlight Eskimo kayack, which for an ordinary man is not even a burden.\r\nWhat was to be done? The only chance of life seemed to lie in reaching\r\nthe shore; but how were these gaunt, frail skeletons to convey their\r\nboat across the rugged ice until they reached the open water?\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DRAGGING THE OOGJOOK (SEE PAGE 295).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SUNLIGHT EFFECT IN THE ARCTIC REGION (SEE PAGE\r\n  291).]\r\n\r\nThey decided, however, on making the attempt, in the hope of reaching\r\na place called Shaumen, a little to the north of Cape Mercy, in lat.\r\n65° N., where game, and sometimes Eskimos, were to be found. In spite\r\nof all their efforts, they were foiled by a succession of blinding,\r\nlashing, beating snow-storms. The mercury sank again to 24° below zero,\r\nand their position grew desperate. They were reduced to one meal--and\r\nsuch a meal!--_per diem_. Great was their joy on the 28th when\r\nthe hunters brought in thirty-seven dove-kies, or two apiece. They\r\nwere cooked without delay, and eaten up to the last morsel, except\r\nthe feathers. Greater still was their joy on the 2nd (of March), when\r\nEskimo Joe shot a monster oogjook (a large kind of seal), the largest\r\nthey had ever seen--such a monster that it took all hands to drag\r\nits carcass to the huts. Peter danced and sung in the exuberance of\r\nhis delight, and everybody felt that for a time they were saved from\r\nstarvation. On measurement, this glorious oogjook proved to be seven\r\nfeet nine inches in length, or fully nine feet including the tail.\r\n\r\nThe ice-raft was now approaching Cumberland Gulf, and Tyson calculated\r\nthat they had reached lat. 65° N. They drifted more and more rapidly;\r\nand if they did not die of famine,--if the ice did not break up too\r\nsuddenly,--there was a probability of their reaching the whaling\r\nground, and falling in with some friendly ship. The gales, however,\r\nwere frequent and severe; the thermometer continued very low--32° to\r\n34° below zero; and the sufferings of the whole company were intense.\r\nEven the Eskimos were sorely afflicted; though without these bold and\r\npatient hunters, the white men must certainly have perished.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIRST SIGHT OF A WHALE.]\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of March there were indications of the breaking up of the\r\nfloe. It cracked and snapped beneath them, with a sound like that of\r\ndistant thunder. So far as the surface was concerned, however, no signs\r\nof fracture were visible; the eye, straining in every direction, saw\r\nnothing but an unbroken expanse of ice. And thus it continued until the\r\n12th, when, during a terrible storm, the threatened catastrophe took\r\nplace, the ice-raft being shattered suddenly into hundreds of pieces,\r\non one of which, not more that one hundred yards by seventy-five, the\r\nadventurers found themselves adrift! Oh, what a night of dread anxiety\r\nthey passed, expecting every moment that this piece too would give\r\nway, and plunge them into ruin! But it held together; and when the\r\nwind abated, and the snow ceased to fall, and the wild hurtling of the\r\nbroken ice was hushed, they could look around them, and realize their\r\nposition. The condition of the ice had undergone an absolute change;\r\nthe “floes” were driven up into a “pack,” and huge blocks, of all\r\nshapes and sizes, were heaped up and jammed together in inextricable\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FACE TO FACE WITH A POLAR BEAR.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: AN ARCTIC ICE-SCAPE (SEE PAGE 292).]\r\n\r\nNoting that on the 21st of March seven seals replenished the empty\r\nlarder of our adventurers, and that on the 26th whales were visible for\r\nthe first time,--a welcome sign, as indicating their approach to the\r\nfishing-grounds,--we pass on to the 29th, which was marked by a curious\r\nincident. Shortly after dark, Tyson heard a noise outside his hut; he\r\nhad just taken off his boots, preparing for rest; Joe, too, was on the\r\npoint of retiring, but thinking the ice was breaking up, he went out\r\nto view the “situation.” In a few seconds he hastily returned, pallid\r\nand frightened, and exclaiming, “There is a bear close to my kayack!”\r\nThe kayack lay within ten feet of the entrance to the hut. Both Joe\r\nand Tyson’s rifles were outside; Joe’s within the kayack, and Tyson’s\r\nlying close to it; but Joe had his pistol in the hut. The captain\r\nput on his boots, and then both crept cautiously out. Seal-skins and\r\nlumps of blubber were lying about in all directions; and Bruin, having\r\ndragged some of these about thirty feet from the kayack, was banqueting\r\nat his ease. Joe crept into the sailors’ hut to alarm them. Meantime\r\nTyson crawled stealthily to his rifle, but in taking it knocked down\r\na shot-gun standing by. The bear heard it, but Tyson’s rifle already\r\ncovered him; he growled; Tyson pulled the trigger, but the gun would\r\nnot go off; a second, and a third time--it did not go; but Tyson did,\r\nfor the bear now rushed full upon him. Retiring to the hut, he put\r\nanother cartridge in, and then again crept out into the open, taking up\r\na position where he could see the animal, although the night was dark.\r\nThe bear, too, saw his assailant, and faced towards him; but this time\r\nthe rifle-ball went straight to its mark; the bear ran about two rods,\r\nand fell dead.\r\n\r\nThe victim was a “sea-bear,” _Ursus maritimus_, and supplied the\r\ncompany on the ice-raft with a welcome change of diet.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ON BOARD THE BOAT.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: BREAKING UP OF THE ICE.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: JOE CAPTURES A SEAL.]\r\n\r\nAs the piece of ice was gradually wearing away, the adventurers of\r\nthe _Polaris_ resolved on an effort to regain the main pack,\r\nwhich would necessarily be safer. With their sleeping-gear, tent, and\r\na supply of shot and powder, they embarked on board the boat, and\r\nstood to the westward; and on the 4th of April, after a succession of\r\nrough experiences, reached the “pack.” Here they were not much better\r\noff, for a violent gale blowing from the north-east, the ice began to\r\nbreak off in huge fragments; and soon the area at the command of the\r\nnavigators was so small, that they were compelled to reload the boat,\r\nand prepare for a hurried departure. The wind, however, subsided, the\r\npack closed up, and things returned to their normal condition.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A NIGHT OF FEAR (SEE PAGE 296).]\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of April the castaways were somewhat reinvigorated by the\r\ncapture of a seal, which Joe brought ashore in his kayack, and by the\r\nappearance of land to the south-west. But in this wild Arctic region\r\nthe weather in spring is subject to surprising changes, and on the\r\n20th another gale began to blow. Such was its fury that it drove a\r\nheavy swell of sea across the ice-raft, which washed away every article\r\nthat was loose. Billow after billow followed with ever-increasing\r\nviolence; and tent, and skins, and nearly all the bed-gear, were swept\r\ninto the boiling waters. Only a few articles were saved, which, along\r\nwith the women and children, had been stowed in the boat. To save the\r\nboat tasked the energies of all the party, who had to hold on to it,\r\nwith might and main, to prevent it from being carried out to sea. All\r\nthrough the dreadful night the men were on the watch against this\r\ncrowning disaster; all through the dreary night, from 9 P.M.\r\nuntil 7 A.M., straining every nerve, calling into play every\r\nresource of energy. Ever and anon, one of the tremendous billows would\r\nplunge downward, and lift the boat bodily, and the men with it, and\r\ncarry it and them forward on the ice, almost to the opposite edge of\r\nthe floating raft; several times the boat heeled partly over, and was\r\nhauled back only by the more than human strength which the crew derived\r\nfrom a knowledge of their position. The boat gone, all was lost!\r\nTerrible was the work; had the waters been smooth, the task would not\r\nhave been easy; but they were filled with loose ice, which rolled about\r\nin blocks of all shapes and sizes, and with almost every wave these\r\ncame toppling and rolling and driving forward like an avalanche, and\r\nfell about the heads and limbs of the men as they clung desperately\r\nto the boat. But God mercifully supplied them with the strength they\r\nneeded; and so, labouring to the uttermost, they waited and watched\r\nfor the day. For twelve hours scarcely a sound was uttered except the\r\ncrying of the children, and Tyson’s stern command to “Hold on,” or\r\n“Bear down,” with the responsive “Ay, ay, sir” of the men.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A “HELL OF WATERS.”]\r\n\r\nDay dawned at last, with a dull gray light over the restless sea, and\r\nTyson saw with indescribable thankfulness a large raft of ice floating\r\nwithin reach. He determined to make for it, though the men hesitated\r\nto launch the boat into such a “hell of waters.” But it was done;\r\nthe women and children were first got on board, and then all the men\r\nembarked in safety. By dint of hard pulling, they gained the ice,\r\nlanded, refreshed themselves with a morsel of food, and then, on this\r\nnew ice-raft, laid down to rest. The following morning found them “safe\r\nand sound,” after all their trials, with the exception of a few bruises\r\nand contusions.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of April another bear was killed; and just in time, for\r\nthe whole party were without a morsel of food. This lasted them for\r\nthree or four days; and then, on the 25th, as starvation once more\r\nstared them in the face, they resolved on a desperate effort to make\r\nthe land. What else were they to do? The rain fell in torrents; the\r\nwind blew a hurricane; the ice-raft was constantly wasting away; they\r\nhad no provisions. True, the boat was frail and leaky, and the sea ran\r\nhigh; but as the ice would not much longer afford them even a footing,\r\na decision was forced upon them.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DRAGGING THE BOAT ON TO A FLOE.]\r\n\r\nSo in their crippled, overloaded boat they set out, the wind blowing\r\na gale, and a tremendous sea running, full of small knife-like blades\r\nof ice. After eight hours’ labour at the oars, they came to a piece of\r\nfloe, and encamped upon it for the night. At daylight on the 28th they\r\nagain launched their boat; and after much weary work in threading their\r\nway through a fleet of icebergs, they got into comparatively open water.\r\n\r\nAt half-past four, a joyful sight!--a steamer right ahead, and bearing\r\nnorth of them. The castaways hoisted their colours, and pulled towards\r\nher. She was a sealer, going south-west, and making her way through the\r\nfloating ice. The hearts of the castaways beat with joy at the prospect\r\nof speedy relief; but, alas, they were doomed to disappointment! She\r\ndid not see the miserable little company in the overloaded boat; and it\r\nwas impossible for them to overtake her. Night gathered over the sea,\r\nand she disappeared.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: CLINGING TO THE BOAT (SEE PAGE 308).]\r\n\r\nReaching a suitable piece of floe, they boarded it, and again encamped\r\nfor the night, under a sky which was clear and calm, and shone with the\r\nglory of stars. The sea, too, was tranquil, and, notwithstanding their\r\ndisappointment, they felt more hopeful than before; it was evident they\r\nhad reached the borders of civilization, and might rely upon obtaining\r\nhelp. With seals’ blubber they kindled beacon-fires on the ice; and\r\ndivided their men into two watches.\r\n\r\nThe next day they sighted another steamer, launched their boat, and\r\npulled lustily towards her. In vain: she did not see them, and after a\r\ncouple of hours’ hard work they were hemmed in by the ice, and could\r\nmake no progress. They landed on a floe, and hoisted their colours;\r\ncollected and loaded all their rifles and pistols, and filled the\r\nechoes with the ringing report of three simultaneous volleys. They\r\nheard three shots in reply, and--glorious sight!--saw the steamer\r\ndirecting her course towards them. They shouted with all their might;\r\nbut in the keen air their voices seemed to pass away soundlessly.\r\nPresently the steamer changed her course, tacking south, then north,\r\nthen west, as if she were vainly endeavouring to force a passage\r\nthrough the accumulated ice. Yet there seemed no insuperable obstacle\r\nin her path. The fugitives fired again, and again; but she came no\r\nnearer, and late in the afternoon steamed away to the south west.\r\n\r\nAt sunset they descried land in the same direction, about thirty-five\r\nmiles distant.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the 30th of April, Tyson was lying in the boat,\r\nhis watch having just ended, when the look-out raised a sudden shout:\r\n“There’s a steamer! there’s a steamer!” As if fresh life had been\r\npoured into his veins, Tyson sprang to his feet, ordered all the guns\r\nto be fired, joined his companions in a loud simultaneous cry, and\r\nraised their colours to the head of the boat’s mast. Hans leaped into\r\nhis kayack, and was despatched to intercept the ship, if possible,\r\nas there was some danger of losing sight of her in the fog which\r\nprevailed; but, happily, she bore down towards them. Hans paddled on,\r\nand in his broken English shouted, “American steamer.” He was not\r\nunderstood by those on board, but they kept their course, and in a\r\nfew minutes lay alongside of the ice-isle which sheltered Tyson and\r\nhis company. Oh, what three loud, hearty, joyful cheers acknowledged\r\ntheir deliverance! These were immediately returned by the crew of the\r\nsteamer, which proved to be the sealer _Tigress_, of Conception\r\nBay, Newfoundland.\r\n\r\nWe quote from Captain Tyson’s simply-worded narrative:--\r\n\r\n“Two or three of their small seal-boats were instantly lowered. We,\r\nhowever, now that relief was certain, threw everything from our own\r\nboat, and in a minute’s time she was in the water; while the boats of\r\nthe _Tigress_ came on, and the crews got on our bit of ice, and\r\npeeped curiously into the dirty pans we had used over the oil-fires. We\r\nhad been making soup out of the blood and entrails of the last little\r\nseal which Hans had shot. They soon saw enough to convince them that we\r\nwere in sore need. No words were required to make _that_ plain.\r\n\r\n“Taking the women and children in their boats, we tumbled into our\r\nown, and were soon alongside of the _Tigress_. We left all we had\r\nbehind, and our all was simply a few battered smoky tin pans and the\r\n_débris_ of our last seal. It had already become offal in our\r\neyes, though we had often been glad enough to get such fare.\r\n\r\n“On stepping on board, I was at once surrounded by a curious lot of\r\npeople--I mean men filled with curiosity to know our story, and all\r\nasking questions of me and the men. I told them who I was, and where\r\nwe were from. But when they asked me, ‘How long have you been on the\r\nice?’ and I answered, ‘Since the 15th of last October,’ they were so\r\nastonished that they fairly looked blank with wonder.\r\n\r\n“One of the party, looking at me with open-eyed surprise, exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n“‘_And was you on it night and day?_’\r\n\r\n“The peculiar expression of the tone, with the absurdity of the\r\nquestion, was too much for my politeness. I laughed in spite of\r\nmyself, and my long unexercised risibles thrilled with an unwonted\r\nsensation.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTyson and his party were picked up in lat. 53° 35’ N.; a fact which\r\nwill give the reader some idea of the wonderful voyage they had\r\naccomplished on their various ice-rafts.\r\n\r\nThey were treated with thoughtful kindness on board the _Tigress_,\r\nwhich on the 7th of May turned her head towards Newfoundland. On the\r\nfollowing day she put into Conception Bay, where the Americans landed,\r\nand remained until the 12th. They then started for St. John’s; and\r\nthe news of their remarkable experiences having preceded them, found\r\nthemselves on their arrival the objects of a very general and lively\r\ncuriosity. After a short stay, they were conveyed to Washington on\r\nboard the United States steamship _Frolic_. And here ends their\r\nstrange, eventful history.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must now return to the _Polaris_.\r\n\r\nWhen she drifted away in the darkness of that stormy night, she had\r\non board fourteen persons: Captain Buddington, Dr. Emil Bessel,\r\nMessrs. Bryan and Chester, and ten officers and seamen. What had\r\nbecome of them and their vessel? Such was the natural question which\r\narose on the safe arrival at Washington of Tyson and his companions;\r\nand the American Government quickly came to the determination of\r\norganizing a relieving party to seek for and bring back the survivors\r\nand remains, if any, of the _Polaris_ expedition. The steamship\r\n_Juniata_ was immediately despatched to form a depôt of supplies\r\non the coast of Greenland in advance. She reached Upernavik on the\r\n31st of July, and there brought into use her steam-launch, the\r\n_Little Juniata_; which, manned by a gallant crew, pushed forward\r\ninto the icy waters of Melville Bay, but without coming upon any\r\ntraces of the missing explorers. Meantime, the American Government\r\npurchased the _Tigress_, and fitted her up for a thorough cruise\r\nin the Arctic seas. With Captain Greer in command, and Mr. Tyson as\r\nacting-lieutenant, and a crew of eleven officers and forty-two men,\r\n“all told,” the _Tigress_ set sail on the evening of July 14th,\r\nand dropped anchor at St. John’s on the morning of the 23rd.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of August we find her at Upernavik, where she took on board\r\na supply of coal from the _Juniata_. She then proceeded northward,\r\nfalling in with the heavy pack-ice near Cape York. The 14th saw her off\r\nthe Eskimo settlement of Netlik. She was now approaching Northumberland\r\nIsland, in the neighbourhood of which, or of Littleton Island, it was\r\nsupposed the _Polaris_ had parted from the ice-floe. Captain\r\nGreer carefully examined Northumberland Island, but without success.\r\nHe then made for Littleton Island; and a boat was lowered to go on\r\nshore, carrying Lieutenant White, Captain Tyson, and other officers.\r\nWhat was their surprise, as they approached, to discover some human\r\nfigures and a couple of tents on the mainland, near Littleton Island.\r\nThe figures proved to be Eskimos; and through the agency of Eskimo\r\nJoe, who was on board the _Tigress_, it was soon ascertained that\r\nCaptain Buddington had deserted the _Polaris_ on the day after\r\nher separation from the floe; that he and his companions had erected\r\na house on the mainland, and wintered therein; had fitted it up with\r\nsleeping-berths for fourteen men, the full number, and furnished\r\nit with stove, table, chairs, and other articles removed from the\r\nabandoned ship; that during the winter the party had built and equipped\r\na couple of sailing-boats; and that “about the time when the ducks\r\nbegin to hatch” they had departed for the south.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SAVED!]\r\n\r\nThe Eskimo chief, or leader, added that Captain Buddington had made him\r\na present of the _Polaris_; but that the gift proved of no effect,\r\nfor in a violent gale she broke loose from the ice, drifted out into\r\nthe channel, and foundered.\r\n\r\nFurther search brought the crew of the _Tigress_ to the winter-camp\r\nof the _Polaris_ crew. It was situated in lat. 78° 23’ N., and long.\r\n73° 46’ W. Some manuscripts were found there, with the log-book, the\r\nmedical stores, and remains of instruments; and these, with whatever\r\nelse that seemed of intrinsic value, having been removed on board the\r\n_Tigress_, the expedition bore away to the southward, and on the 16th\r\nof October reached St. John’s, Newfoundland, where they received the\r\nwelcome intelligence of the rescue of the _Polaris_ party under the\r\ncircumstances we shall now relate.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe return to the eventful night of the 15th of October 1872. During the\r\ntremendous gale that then raged along the Arctic coast, the bow-hawser\r\nof the _Polaris_ snapped like a “pack-thread,” the anchors\r\nslipped, and the ship drifted away into the darkness. The wind forced\r\nher in a north-easterly direction; and next morning those on board\r\nfound her “a little north of Littleton Island, in Smith Sound, having\r\nbeen exactly abreast of Sutherland Island during a portion of the\r\nnight.”\r\n\r\nAs she was leaking rapidly the pumps were set to work; and the fires\r\nwith much difficulty being lighted, the ship was got to obey her helm.\r\nIt was then found that the following officers and men remained on\r\nboard:--Captain Buddington; Mr. Chester, chief mate; William Merton,\r\nsecond mate; Emil Schuman, chief engineer; Odell, assistant-engineer;\r\nCampbell and Booth, firemen; Coffin, carpenter; Sieman, Hobby, Hays,\r\nand Manch, seamen; Dr. Emil Bessel, meteorologist; and Mr. Bryan,\r\nastronomer and chaplain.\r\n\r\nA look-out was kept, it is said, for the nineteen who were missing,\r\nbut no signs of them being discovered, Captain Buddington came to\r\nthe comfortable conclusion that they had saved themselves in the\r\nboats. Doubting the feasibility of carrying the _Polaris_ to the\r\nsouthward, he determined to abandon her, and winter on shore. With this\r\nview she was run in as near land as possible, and finally grounded\r\nin Kane’s Life-boat Cove, lat. 78° 23’ 30″ N., and long. 73° 21’ W.\r\nHere, on the 17th of October, Captain Buddington prepared to establish\r\na winter-camp; and the next few days were occupied in removing from\r\nthe stranded vessel all the food and fuel, and such articles as could\r\nconduce to the comfort and sustenance of the party through the ensuing\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith spars, bulk-heads, and canvas brought from the _Polaris_ a\r\ncommodious house was erected, measuring twenty-two feet in length,\r\nand fourteen feet in width. It was thoroughly water-tight; warmed\r\ninside by a stove; and banked outside with masses of compact snow. In\r\nthe interior the sides were lined with fourteen sleeping-berths. A\r\ntable and chairs and lamps added to the general comfort; so that our\r\nexplorers were prepared to brave a Polar winter under more favourable\r\nconditions than those experienced by most Arctic navigators.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a few days a party of native Eskimos, with five\r\nsledges, made their appearance, and their friendly labours were\r\nfound of no little value. They considered themselves amply repaid by\r\na few presents of knives, needles, and the like, and after a short\r\nstay returned to their settlement at Etah. However, others soon\r\ntook their place; and eventually two or three families built their\r\n_igloes_ in the neighbourhood of the American camp. The Eskimo\r\nwomen made themselves very useful by making and repairing clothing, and\r\nrendering other feminine courtesies; while the men, when game became\r\nplentiful, supplied the little settlement with a welcome abundance of\r\nfresh meat. Nor was this the only advantage derived from the presence\r\nof the Eskimos; on the contrary, it had an excellent effect on the\r\n_morale_ of the men, who did not feel that utter isolation, that\r\nsense of being cut off from human companionship, and separated from the\r\nrest of the world, which is one of the severest trials of wintering in\r\nthe Arctic regions. The heavy pressure of the long, dark Polar night\r\nwas wonderfully lightened by the kindly attentions and mirthful society\r\nof the Eskimos.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that some of the _Polaris_ crew never spent a\r\nhappier winter. There was no want of food, no suffering from cold;\r\ntheir quarters were warm, cheerful, and well-lighted. Time did not hang\r\nheavily on their hands; for when the house-work was done, when the\r\nfires were replenished, the lamps trimmed, and the day’s provisions\r\ncooked, they amused themselves with reading or writing, or played at\r\nchess, draughts, and cards. It is true they had no communication with\r\nthe world without, and no intelligence could reach them from friends\r\nor kinsmen; but, _surgit amari aliquid_--in the cup of human\r\nhappiness a bitter drop is always found!\r\n\r\nWhen the worst of the winter was past, they began, under the direction\r\nof the carpenter, to construct a couple of boats, with the view of\r\nreturning homeward as soon as the ice broke up. Each was twenty-five\r\nfeet long, square fore and aft, and five feet beam; capable, that\r\nis, of carrying seven men, with provisions for about two months, in\r\nwhich time they might reasonably calculate on reaching the civilized\r\nsettlements. It was the end of May before the condition of the ice\r\nenabled them to set out. Then they broke up their camp, rewarded their\r\nEskimo friends, carried on board stores and provisions; and, finally,\r\nearly on the morning of the 1st of June they bade farewell to their\r\nwinter-home, and sailed out into the waters of Smith Sound.\r\n\r\nTheir voyage was unmarked by any disastrous incident, and presents\r\na strange contrast to the dangerous experiences of Tyson and his\r\ncompanions. Wherever they landed, they obtained an abundant supply of\r\naquatic birds, seal, and other game. They were all in good health,\r\nwell-fed, well-clothed. Their boats were sound and strong. The winter\r\nhad long passed away, and the glorious summer sun poured its full\r\nradiance on the calm surface of the Arctic sea. Sailing pleasantly\r\nalong, they touched at Hakluyt Island, and subsequently landed on the\r\nwest shore of Northumberland Island. The pack-ice detained them there\r\nuntil the 10th. They then entered a water-way toward Cape Parry, but\r\nwere subsequently forced back by the ice to the place whence they had\r\nstarted. On the 12th the channel was clearer. They set sail again;\r\ncrossed the southern part of Murchison Sound; doubled Cape Parry; and\r\nhalted for rest and refreshment on Blackwood Point, near Fitz Clarence\r\nRock. Thence they made, in due succession, for Wolstenholme Island, and\r\nCape York,--names which recall the adventures of the earlier explorers.\r\n\r\nTheir course now assumed a more difficult character, as they had come\r\nface to face with the ice of Melville Bay,--that great expanse of\r\nArctic waters which is surrounded by glacier-loaded shores, and has\r\nalways been a favourite “whaling-ground.” Here they encountered some\r\ndifficulty with the “pack;” the “leads,” or water-ways, curiously\r\nintersecting one another, and striking far into the ice, and so closing\r\nup that it was often necessary to haul their boats across a kind of\r\npromontory, or tongue, from one lead to another. Their troubles,\r\nhowever, were of brief duration. On the twentieth day after leaving\r\nLife-boat Cove, they sighted a steamer, beset in the ice, at a distance\r\nof thirty or thirty-five miles from Cape York. She could not come to\r\n_them_, it was true, but they could go to her; and this they\r\nprepared to do. They had not traversed half the distance, however,\r\nbefore they met a body of eighteen men from the ship; for they too\r\nhad been seen, and recognized as white men, and relief immediately\r\ndespatched. The friendly vessel proved to be the _Ravenscraig_ of\r\nDundee, Captain Allen, lying in lat. 75° 38’ N., and long. 65° 35’ W.\r\n\r\nIt was now found, according to the narrative of the expedition,\r\nthat the relief did not come much too soon, for the boats had been\r\nconsiderably injured by contact with the rough hummocky ice. And the\r\nfatigue of hauling them over such a surface may be inferred from\r\nthe fact that it took the _Polaris_ crew, with their eighteen\r\nrelief-men from the _Ravenscraig_, six hours to reach the latter\r\nvessel. The difficulty was increased by a deep slushy snow, which lay\r\nthick upon the ice, and which was not only heavy and disagreeable to\r\nthe wayfarer, but exceedingly dangerous, as more than one found by\r\nsinking into the pitfalls it treacherously concealed.\r\n\r\nBut they reached the _Ravenscraig_ at midnight, and received a\r\nhearty welcome from Captain Allen, who was able also to communicate\r\nthe grateful intelligence that their comrades, the little company sent\r\nadrift on the ice-raft, were all in safety.\r\n\r\nIt has been well said that the _Polaris_ expedition proved\r\ncuriously prolific of startling and exciting incidents. From the time\r\nwhen Captain Bartlett of the _Tigress_ rescued the “exhausted\r\nwaifs” of the ice-floe, until the last scene in this romantic drama\r\nwas enacted, the public mind had been kept in a condition of continual\r\nexpectancy by the progress of events connected with the story of these\r\nArctic explorers. The lamentable death of Captain Hall,--the long\r\nvoyage on the ice-floe through the gloom of the Polar night,--the\r\nreturn of the nineteen castaways after so many hairbreadth escapes\r\nand wonderful adventures,--the departure of the _Tigress_,--the\r\ndiscovery of Buddington’s winter-camp,--and now the rescue of him\r\nand his crew by the Dundee whaler, formed a series of surprising and\r\nexciting events, which, if not of epical interest, would certainly seem\r\nto furnish matter for a poet’s song. Even the early annals of Arctic\r\nexploration, with their narratives of the achievements and sufferings\r\nof Hudson, Davis, Barentz, present no incidents of a more remarkable\r\ncharacter. As men dwelt upon them, they came to acknowledge that the\r\n“age of romance” was not ended yet.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of September 1873, the _Arctic_ whaling-steamer arrived at\r\nDundee with eleven of the _Polaris_ survivors, who had been transferred\r\nto her from the _Ravenscraig_, as the latter was not homeward bound.\r\nThree others reached America in the _Intrepid_; and thus the expedition\r\nof the _Polaris_ terminated without any loss of life, if we except the\r\nunfortunate death of her enthusiastic commander, Captain Hall.\r\n\r\nIt added nothing, it is true, to our geographical knowledge of the\r\nArctic World; and yet it was not without some useful results. The\r\n_Polaris_, at all events, approached nearer to the North Pole\r\nthan any one of her predecessors; and men of science were thenceforth\r\njustified in asserting that the hope of complete success was no longer\r\nchimerical. The distance to the pole from the point reached by the\r\n_Polaris_ was comparatively so trivial, as to afford good reason\r\nfor believing that it would not long baffle human resolution and\r\nenterprise. Then, again, it was established as a fact beyond doubt that\r\nEuropeans could securely winter in a latitude of 81° 38’; that a ship\r\nwell built and well equipped might push northward as far as 82° 16’;\r\nand that no insuperable obstacles to its further advance could then be\r\ndetected. It was also shown that the temperature, even in lat. 82°, was\r\nnot of a nature to overcome the energy and enthusiasm of men accustomed\r\nto life and adventure in the Arctic World. These data, so conclusively\r\nestablished by experience, constituted a source of great encouragement\r\nto future navigators, and permit the conclusion that the _Polaris_\r\nexpedition, with all its disasters and mismanagement, helped forward\r\nthe great work of discovering the North Pole.\r\n\r\n“We now know,” says Mr. Markham, “that the American vessel commanded by\r\nCaptain Hall passed up the strait, in one working season, for a direct\r\ndistance of two hundred and fifty miles, without a check of any kind,\r\nreaching lat. 82° 16’ N.; and that at her furthest point the sea was\r\nstill navigable, with a water-sky to the northward.”\r\n\r\nThe _Polaris_, however, was nothing better than a river-steamer\r\nof small power, ill adapted for encountering the perils of Arctic\r\nnavigation,--with a crew, all told, of thirty men, women, and children,\r\nincluding eight Eskimos. If she could accomplish such a voyage without\r\ndifficulty, and could attain so high a latitude, it was reasonable to\r\nanticipate that a properly equipped English expedition, under equally\r\nfavourable circumstances, would do, not only as much, but much more,\r\nand carry the British flag into the waters of the circumpolar sea, if\r\nsuch existed. With this view, the Admiralty fitted out the _Alert_\r\nand the _Discovery_, under Captains Nares and Stephenson. Every\r\nprecaution that science could suggest was adopted to ensure the\r\ncompleteness of their equipment; and the two ships, accompanied as far\r\nas Disco by H.M.S. _Valorous_ as a tender, left England on the\r\n29th May 1875.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe British Expedition, consisting of the _Alert_ and the\r\n_Discovery_, did not succeed in all it was intended to accomplish;\r\nand yet it can hardly be spoken of as a failure. It did not reach that\r\nconventional point of geographers, the North Pole, but it penetrated\r\nwithin four hundred miles of it; and it ascertained the exact nature of\r\nthe obstacles which render access impossible, except under conditions\r\nnot at present in existence. We agree with a thoughtful writer in the\r\n_Spectator_ that this was a most important service rendered both\r\nto Science and the State. We now know that by the Smith Sound route a\r\nship may attain to within 450 miles of the Pole; and that, afterwards,\r\na journey about as long as from London to Edinburgh must be undertaken,\r\nin a rigorous climate, with the thermometer 50° below zero, over ice\r\npacked up into hillocks and hummocks which render sledge-travelling\r\nalmost impracticable, or practicable only by hewing out a path with\r\nthe pickaxe at the rate of a mile and a half a day. And further: the\r\nwork would have to be begun and completed in four months, or, from lack\r\nof light and warmth, it could not be done at all. These are serious\r\ndifficulties, and whether it is worth while for men to encounter them,\r\nwhere the gain would be problematical, we need not here inquire.\r\nBefore any attempt can be made, some provision must be discovered\r\nfor protecting those who make it against the excessive cold, and for\r\na surer and swifter mode of conveyance than the sledge affords. The\r\njournalist to whom we have referred speculates that science may furnish\r\nfuture expeditions with undreamt-of resources,--with portable light\r\nand heat, for instance, from the newly-discovered mines at Disco;\r\npreventives against scurvy; electric lights; supplies of dynamite for\r\nblowing up the ice; and a traction-engine to traverse the road thus\r\nconstructed; but, in the meantime, these appliances are not at our\r\ncommand. We must be content with the measure of success achieved by\r\nCaptain Nares and his gallant followers.\r\n\r\nAnd these well deserve the gratitude of all who think the fame and\r\nhonour of a nation are precious possessions. They have shown clearly\r\nthat the “race” has not degenerated; that Englishmen can do and suffer\r\nnow as they did and suffered in the old time. They displayed a courage\r\nand a fortitude of truly heroic proportions. And the experiences of\r\nArctic voyaging are always of a nature to require the highest courage\r\nand the sternest fortitude. The long Arctic night is in itself as\r\nsevere a test of true manhood as can well be devised. The miner works\r\nunder conditions for less laborious than those to which the Arctic\r\nexplorer submits, for he enjoys an alternation of light and darkness;\r\nhis underground toil lasts but for a few hours at a time. Yet we know\r\nthat it tries a man’s manly qualities sorely! What, then, must it be to\r\nkeep brave and cheerful and true throughout a prolonged night of one\r\nhundred and forty-two days--that apparently endless darkness, almost\r\nthe darkness of a sunless world?\r\n\r\nWe know, too, that continuous work, without relaxation, for month\r\nafter month, will break down the nerves and shatter the intellect of\r\nthe strongest. Yet we read that the men of the _Alert_ toiled\r\nlike slaves, on one occasion, for seventy-two days, in cold so extreme\r\nthat the reader can form no conception of its severity, and with the\r\ndread constantly hanging over them of that terrible and most depressing\r\ndisease, scurvy. Owing to their inability to procure any fresh game, as\r\nmost former expeditions had done, each of the extended sledge-parties,\r\nwhen at their farthest distance from any help, was attacked by it.\r\nThe return-journeys were, therefore, a prolonged homeward struggle of\r\nmen who grew weaker at every step, the available force to draw the\r\nsledge continually decreasing, and the weight to be dragged as steadily\r\nincreasing, as, one after another, the men stricken down had to be\r\ncarried by their enfeebled comrades.\r\n\r\nIt has been well said that in such exploits as these there is a\r\nsustained heroism which we cannot fully appreciate, because we cannot\r\nfully realize the terrible character of the sacrifices involved. But it\r\nis comparatively easy for us to understand, and therefore to admire,\r\nthe courage of Lieutenant Parr, when he started alone on a journey\r\nof thirty-five miles, with no other guide for his adventurous steps\r\nthan the fresh track of a wandering wolf over the ice and snow, in\r\norder to carry help and comfort to his failing comrades. It is easy\r\nto understand, and therefore to admire, the devotion of Mr. Egerton\r\nand Lieutenant Rawson, when, at the imminent risk of their own lives,\r\nthey nursed Petersen, the interpreter, while travelling from the\r\n_Alert_ to the _Discovery_, with the temperature 40° below\r\nzero. Petersen, who had accompanied them with the dog-sledge, fell ill;\r\nand with a noble unselfishness they succeeded in retaining heat in the\r\npoor fellow’s body by alternately lying one at a time alongside of him,\r\nwhile the other by exercise was recovering his own vital warmth. We\r\ncan also acknowledge and admire the constancy of Captain Nares, who,\r\nin that horrible climate, lived thirty-six days in the “crow’s-nest,”\r\nwhile his ship laboured among the grinding, shivering, crushing ice,\r\nuntil exhaustion overcame him. And we can acknowledge and admire the\r\nbravery and faithfulness of the men of the sledge-parties who, for days\r\nand weeks, drew the sledges and their comrades, with gloom above and\r\naround them, ice and snow everywhere bounding the prospect, and in a\r\ntemperature which seemed to freeze the blood and benumb the heart.\r\n\r\nWhat a tale, says a writer in the _Times_, what a tale of\r\nunrequited suffering it is! Surely not “unrequited;” for those who\r\nsuffered, suffered at the call of duty, and have been rewarded by the\r\napproval of their countrymen, and by the consciousness of having done\r\nsomething great, of not having lived in vain. “How lightly do all talk\r\nof glory; how little do they know what it means! The little army had to\r\ncut its way through the ice-barriers, dragging heavily-laden sledges,\r\nand going to and fro, the whole force being often required for each\r\nsledge, content to make a mile and a quarter a day, in pursuit of an\r\nobject still four hundred miles off, through increasing difficulties,\r\nand with barely five months, or one hundred and fifty days, wherein\r\nto go and return. The labour is a dreadful reality; the scheme itself\r\na nightmare, the phantasy of a disordered brain. Even the smaller and\r\nsubsidiary expedition for planting a depôt last autumn cost three\r\namputations. The cold was beyond all former experience for intensity\r\nand length, and the physical effect of a long winter spent in the ships\r\nunder such conditions is particularized as one reason why the men\r\nwere less able to endure cold, labour, and the want of proper food.\r\nEvery one of the expeditions, whatever the direction, came back in the\r\nsaddest plight,--some dragging the rest, and in one case only reaching\r\nthe ship through the heroism of an officer pushing on many miles alone\r\nto announce his returning comrades, and to procure the aid by which\r\nalone they were saved from destruction. These are episodes, but they\r\nare the matter which redeems the story and makes its truest value. They\r\ntell us what Englishmen will do on occasions beyond our feeble home\r\napprehensions, when once they have accepted a call, and are in duty\r\nbound.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the time we write no elaborate record of the expedition has been\r\npublished, and the materials of the following sketch are collected\r\ntherefore from various narratives which have appeared in the daily\r\njournals. We shall begin by endeavouring to place before the reader,\r\nwith the assistance of Mr. Clements R. Markham, a rapid summary of\r\nwhat the expedition accomplished. And then we shall describe its more\r\ninteresting incidents.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe object of Captain Nares and his followers was to discover\r\nand explore as considerable a portion of the unknown area in the\r\nPolar Regions as was possible with reference to the means at their\r\ndisposal, and to the positions the vessels succeeded in reaching as\r\nstarting-points. The theories about open Polar basins and navigable\r\nwaters which once obtained have long been discarded by practical Arctic\r\ngeographers. A coast-line, however, is needful as a means of progress\r\nto “the threshold of work;” and it is needful, too, in order to secure\r\nthe desired results of Arctic discovery in the various departments of\r\nscientific inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe expedition, then, in the first place, had to force its way through\r\nthe ice-encumbered channel which connects Baffin Bay with the Polar\r\nOcean; a channel which successively bears the names of Smith Sound,\r\nKane Basin, Kennedy Channel, Hall Basin, and Robeson Strait. Smith\r\nSound opens out of Baffin Bay between Capes Alexander and Isabella. The\r\n_Alert_ and the _Discovery_ passed these famous headlands and\r\nentered the Sound on July 29, 1875; and from that date until September\r\n1, when the _Alert_ crossed the Threshold of the Unknown Region,\r\nthey fought one continuous battle with the ice. The _Polaris_,\r\nit is true, had made a rapid passage on the occasion of its memorable\r\nvoyage; but the circumstances were exceptional. Generally the Sound is\r\nblocked up by heavy floes, with winding waters caused by the action\r\nof wind and tide. With great difficulty our two ships forced the\r\nbarrier; but their success was due in no small measure to the skill\r\nand vigilance of Captain Nares, who allowed himself no rest until\r\nthey were out of danger. At length, after many hairbreadth escapes,\r\nand many laborious nights and days, and much energy and devotion on\r\nthe part of the officers, and equal courage and industry on the part\r\nof the men, the expedition reached the north shore of Lady Franklin\r\nInlet, and found a safe, commodious harbour in lat. 81° 44’ N. Here\r\nthe _Discovery_ took up her winter quarters, as had previously\r\nbeen arranged; and the _Alert_, after a brief interval of repose,\r\ncontinued her northward progress.\r\n\r\nThis she was enabled to do through the opportune opening up of a\r\nwater-lane between the shore and the ice. Bravely she dashed ahead,\r\nrounded Cape Union, so named by the men of the _Polaris_\r\nexpedition, and entered the open Polar Ocean. Then, in lat. 82° 20’\r\nN., the white ensign was hoisted on board a British man-of-war in a\r\nlatitude further north than the ship of any nation had reached before.\r\nSoon afterwards the solid masses of the Polar pack-ice began to close\r\naround the adventurous vessel; and on the 3rd of September 1875, the\r\n_Alert_ was fast fixed in her winter quarters, on the ice-bound\r\nshore of the inhospitable Polar Sea in lat. 82° 27’ N.\r\n\r\nThis, says Mr. Markham,[11] was the first grand success; and it\r\nassured the eventual completion of the work. For, owing to the\r\nadmirable seamanship of Captain Nares, and to the zeal and devotion\r\nof the officers and crew, the _Alert_ had been carried across\r\nthe Threshold, and was _within_ the Unknown Region. A point of\r\ndeparture was thus obtained, which rendered certain the achievement of\r\ncomplete success; inasmuch as in whatever direction the sledge-parties\r\ntravelled, valuable discoveries could not fail to be the result.\r\n\r\nThe autumnal excursions, during which depôts of provisions were\r\nestablished for use in the work of the coming spring, were not\r\nperformed without a very considerable amount of suffering. Lieutenant\r\nMay and two seamen were so severely frost-bitten, that, to save their\r\nlives, amputation was found necessary.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen from the latitude given, the ships wintered further\r\nnorth than any ships had ever previously wintered. The cold exceeded\r\nanything previously registered, and darkness extended over a dreary\r\nperiod. The winter, however, was not spent idly: observatories\r\nwere erected, and a mass of valuable scientific data industriously\r\naccumulated.\r\n\r\n“But the crowning glories of this ever-memorable campaign were,”\r\nas Mr. Markham exclaims, “achieved during the spring.” Three main\r\nsledge-expeditions were organized: one, under Commander Markham and\r\nLieutenant Parr, instructed to keep due north, as far as possible,\r\ninto the newly-discovered Polar Ocean; another, under Lieutenant\r\nAldrich, to explore the American coast, westward; and the third, under\r\nLieutenant Beaumont of the _Discovery_, to survey the north coast\r\nof Greenland, facing eastward. Each party consisted of two sledges; and\r\nthe six, with their gallant crews, set out on the 3rd of April 1876,\r\ndetermined to vindicate and maintain the reputation of British seamen.\r\nThey separated at Cape Joseph Henry; and before they again met, this\r\nwas what they achieved:--\r\n\r\nCommander Markham and Lieutenant Parr pushed northward as far as lat.\r\n83° 20’ 26″ N.; being the most northerly point which any explorers have\r\nattained. They may therefore be fairly and justly regarded as “the\r\nChampions” of Arctic Discovery, until some successors, more fortunate\r\nthan they, shall surpass their glorious feat.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Aldrich struck westward; rounded Cape Colombia in lat. 83°\r\n7’ N.; and explored 220 miles of the American coast-line, previously\r\nnot laid down on any map.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Beaumont crossed Robeson Strait, and surveyed the northern\r\ncoast of Greenland for about seventy miles.\r\n\r\n“In order,” it is said, “that these three main parties might do their\r\nwork successfully, every soul in the two ships was actively employed.\r\nThe depôt and relieving parties did most arduous work, and the officers\r\nvied with each other in promoting the objects of the expedition, while\r\nthe most perfect harmony and unanimity prevailed. Captain Feilden and\r\nMr. Hart were especially active in making natural history collections;\r\nand Lieutenants Giffard, Archer, Rawson, Egerton, and Conybeare did\r\nadmirable work in exploring and keeping open communications.” When\r\nthe sledge-parties returned to the ships, Captain Nares found that\r\nthey had suffered terribly; but he also found that their success had\r\nbeen complete. They had solved a geographical problem; no open sea\r\nsurrounded the Pole, as so many sanguine spirits had anticipated. The\r\nway northward was over a waste of ice--of ice broken up into hummocks\r\nand ponderous masses. And with the appliances they possessed further\r\nprogress was impossible; the expedition had reached its _ne plus\r\nultra_.\r\n\r\nThe work was done, and Captain Nares perceived that nothing more could\r\nbe gained, while valuable lives might be lost by remaining longer\r\nin the Polar Ocean. He decided upon returning to England, with the\r\nfollowing rich results to show as the reward of an heroic enterprise:--\r\n\r\nFirst, the expedition had discovered a great Polar Ocean, a knowledge\r\nof which cannot fail to prove of exceeding value to the hydrographer.\r\nNext, the shores of this ocean had been explored along fifty degrees of\r\nlongitude, and important collections formed of specimens of the Arctic\r\nfauna, flora, and geology. The channel connecting the Polar Ocean\r\nwith Smith Sound had also been carefully surveyed, and an accurate\r\ndelineation effected of either shore. Geological discoveries of high\r\nvalue had also been made; as, for example, that of the former existence\r\nof an evergreen forest in lat. 82° 44’ N.,--a fact significant of vast\r\nclimatic changes. And, lastly, interesting observations in meteorology,\r\nmagnetism, tidal and electric phenomena, and spectrum analysis had\r\nbeen carefully recorded. The expedition of 1875–76 must, therefore, in\r\nview of these results, be classed among the most successful which ever\r\nadventured into Arctic waters; though it failed, like its predecessors,\r\nto gain the North Pole.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Alert_ and the _Discovery_ left the shores of England\r\nin May 1875. After a voyage of five weeks’ duration they arrived at\r\nLievely, the port of Disco Island, on the west coast of Greenland.\r\nThis small settlement numbers about ninety-six inhabitants, Danes and\r\nEskimos,--generally speaking, a mixed race. The Danish Inspector of\r\nNorth Greenland resides here, and he received the expedition with a\r\nsalute from three brass cannon planted in front of his house. There\r\nis a well-conducted school, attended by about sixteen children; and\r\na small church, where the schoolmaster reads the Lutheran service\r\non Sundays,--the priest coming over from Upernavik occasionally, to\r\nperform marriages, christenings, and other religious services.\r\n\r\nThe _Alert_ having taken on board thirty Eskimo dogs and a driver,\r\nthe expedition left Disco at one o’clock on July 16th, and next morning\r\nreached Kiltenbunto, about thirty miles further north.\r\n\r\nKiltenbunto is a little island in the Strait of Weigattet, between\r\nDisco and the mainland. Here the _Discovery_ took on board thirty\r\ndogs; and shooting-parties from both ships made a descent on a\r\n“loomery,” or “bird-bazaar,” frequented by guillemots, kittiwakes, and\r\nother ocean-birds. Two or three days later the expedition arrived at a\r\nsettlement named Proven, where it was joined by the Eskimo dog-driver,\r\nHans Christian, the attendant of Kane, Hayes, and Hall, in their\r\nseveral expeditions. At Proven the adventurers received and answered\r\ntheir last letters from “home.”\r\n\r\nStriking northward through Baffin Bay, they reached Cape York on\r\nthe 25th of July, and met with a company of the misnamed Arctic\r\nHighlanders, who traversed the ice-floes in their dog-sledges, and\r\nsoon fraternized with the seamen. A narwhal having been harpooned,\r\na quantity of the skin and blubber was given to these Eskimos. Mr.\r\nHodson, the chaplain of the _Discovery_, describes them as\r\nexceedingly greedy and barbarous, eating whatever fell in their way,\r\nbut living chiefly upon seals. They were not so far advanced in\r\ncivilization as to be able to construct kayacks, and apparently they\r\nhad never before seen Europeans. They wore trousers of bear-skin, and\r\nan upper garment of seal-skin.\r\n\r\nProceeding northward by Dr. Kane’s Crimson Cliffs, they soon reached\r\nthat brave explorer’s celebrated winter quarters, Port Foulke, and took\r\nadvantage of a day’s delay to visit the Brother John Glacier. They\r\nfound Dr. Kane’s journal, but no relics; shot a reindeer, and a large\r\nnumber of birds.\r\n\r\nBetween Melville Bay and the entrance to Smith Sound no ice was met\r\nwith; but on the 30th of July the “pack” was sighted, off Cape Sabine,\r\nin lat. 78° 41´ N. Here, at Port Payer, the ships were fast held by\r\nthe ice for several days. An attempt to proceed further northward was\r\nmade to the west of the islands in Hayes Sound; but the water-way\r\nnot leading in the right direction, the ships returned. On the 6th\r\nof August they made a fresh start, and thenceforward maintained an\r\nuninterrupted struggle with the ice. The _Alert_ led the way,\r\nwith Captain Nares in her “crow’s-nest,” anxiously looking out for\r\npracticable channels. At Cape Frazer the huge solid mass again delayed\r\nthem. Then they succeeded in crossing Kennedy Channel to the east\r\nside, and taking shelter in Petermann Fiord--so named after the great\r\nGerman geographer. After a few days they again pushed northward; and\r\non the 25th of August, after many narrow escapes from being crushed\r\nin the ice, a well-sheltered harbour received them, on the west side\r\nof Hall Basin, north of Lady Franklin Sound, in lat. 81° 44´ N. This\r\nwas at once selected as the winter quarters of the _Discovery_.\r\nHer sister-ship, continuing her course, rounded the north-east point\r\nof Grant Land; but instead of falling in with a continuous coast-line,\r\nstretching one hundred miles further towards the north, as all had\r\nanticipated, found herself on the border of what was evidently a very\r\nextensive sea, with impenetrable ice on every side. As no harbour could\r\nbe found, the ship was secured as far north as possible, inside a kind\r\nof embankment of grounded ice close to the land. There she passed the\r\nwinter; and during the eleven months of her detention no navigable\r\nwater-way, through which she could move further to the north, presented\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nFar from meeting with the “great Polar Sea” dreamed of by Kane and\r\nHayes, our adventurers discovered that the ice-barrier before them\r\nwas unusually thick and solid. It looked as if composed of floating\r\nicebergs which had gradually been jammed and welded together.\r\nHenceforth it will be known on our maps as the Palæocrystic Sea, or Sea\r\nof Ancient Ice; and a stranded mass of ice disrupted from an ice-floe\r\nis to be termed a floeberg.\r\n\r\nOrdinary ice does not exceed ten feet in thickness; but in the Polar\r\nSea, generation after generation, layer has been superimposed on\r\nlayer, until the whole mass measures from eighty feet to one hundred\r\nand twenty feet; it floats with its surface nowhere less than fifteen\r\nfeet above the water-line. It was this wonderful thickness which\r\nprevented the _Alert_ from driving ashore. Owing to its great\r\ndepth of flotation, sixty feet to one hundred feet, the mass grounded\r\non coming into shallow water, and formed a breakwater within which the\r\nship was comparatively secure. “When two pieces of ordinary ice are\r\ndriven one against the other, and the edges broken up, the crushed\r\npieces are raised by the pressure into a high, long, wall-like hedge\r\nof ice. When two of the ancient floes of the Polar Sea meet, the\r\nintermediate lighter broken-up ice which may happen to be floating\r\nabout between them alone suffers; it is pressed up between the two\r\nclosing masses to a great height, producing a chaotic wilderness of\r\nangular blocks of all shapes and sizes, varying in height up to fifty\r\nfeet above water, and frequently covering an area upwards of a mile in\r\ndiameter.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe must now return to the _Discovery_. As soon as she had taken\r\nup her winter quarters, her crew began to unload her, landing the\r\nboats, stores, and spare spars, and otherwise preparing for the\r\nwinter. The first day ashore they shot a herd of eleven musk-oxen. A\r\nfew days afterwards the sea was frozen all round the ship, so that\r\nthey could freely move to and fro about the ice. A week later they saw\r\na large number of musk-oxen, and shot about forty--thus laying in a\r\nconsiderable supply of provisions.\r\n\r\nTheir winter port, which was surrounded by snow-clad hills, about two\r\nthousand feet high, they christened Discovery Harbour.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the sea was completely frozen over, the sledging-parties\r\nwere organized and duly despatched; but as the autumn was rapidly\r\npassing, very little could be done in this direction. The usual\r\npreparations on the part of Arctic explorers were then made for\r\n“hybernating.” Houses were built; also a magnetic observatory and\r\na theatre of ice--recalling the glittering edifice constructed by\r\nCatherine II. of Russia on the Neva, and celebrated by Cowper in the\r\nwell-known lines,--\r\n\r\n                      “No forest fell\r\n    When thou wouldst build, no quarry sent its stores\r\n    To enrich thy walls; but thou didst hew the floods,\r\n    And make thy marble of the glassy wave.”\r\n\r\nA smithy was erected on the 11th of November, being the first the\r\nArctic ice had ever borne. Its roof was made of coal-bags, cemented\r\nwith ice. The ship’s stoker reigned supreme in it as blacksmith; and\r\nwhen we consider the accessories,--the ice, the snow, the darkness,--we\r\nmust admit that his blazing forge must have made a curious picture. The\r\nchaplain tells us, humorously, that the smith adorned the interior wall\r\nwith a good many holes, as each time that his iron wanted cooling he\r\nsimply thrust it into the ice!\r\n\r\nAs for the theatre, which, as we know, has always been a favourite\r\nsource of amusement with Arctic explorers when winter-bound, it\r\nwas sixty feet long and twenty-seven feet broad; and, in honour of\r\nthe Princess of Wales, was named “The Alexandra.” Her birthday was\r\nselected as the day of opening--December 1st; and the opening piece\r\nwas a popular farce--“My Turn Next.” As sailors are generally adepts\r\nat dramatic personations, we may conceive that the piece “went well,”\r\nand that the different actors received the applause they merited. It\r\nis recorded that foremost among them was the engineer, Mr. Miller, who\r\nappears to have been, emphatically, the _Polar Star_. Several of\r\nthe men sung songs; and recitations, old and new, were occasionally\r\nintroduced; the result of the whole being to divert the minds and keep\r\nup the spirits of the ship’s company during the long, long Arctic night.\r\n\r\nThe Fifth of November and its time-honoured associations were not\r\nforgotten. A huge bonfire blazed on the ice; a “Guy Fawkes” was\r\nmanufactured and dressed in the most approved fashion; and the silence\r\nof the frozen solitudes was broken by the sounds of a grand display of\r\nfireworks and the cheering of the spectators.\r\n\r\nA fine level promenade had been constructed on the ice, about a mile in\r\nlength, by sweeping away the snow; and this served as a daily exercise\r\nground. A skating-rink was also constructed. A free hole in the ice,\r\nfor the sake of better ventilation, was carefully kept up. Whenever it\r\nclosed, through a process of gradual congelation, the ice-saws were set\r\nin motion to open it up again, or it was blasted with gunpowder. The\r\ndogs lived on the ice-floe all the winter. It must not be thought that\r\nthe cold was uniform day after day. Probably it is not the _low_\r\ntemperature so much as the _variable_ temperature that makes an\r\nArctic winter so very trying to the European. In a few hours the change\r\nwould be no less than 60°. The cold reached its height--or depth--in\r\nwinter, when the thermometer marked 70½° below zero; the greatest cold\r\never experienced by any Polar expedition. It is difficult for the human\r\nframe to bear up against this excess of rigour, even with the help of\r\ngood fires, good food, and good clothing. Not only the physical but the\r\nmental faculties are debilitated and depressed.\r\n\r\nOur ice-bound seamen, however, managed to keep Christmas merrily.\r\nEarly on the day so dear to Christian memories “the waits” went their\r\nusual rounds,--a sergeant of marines, the chief boatswain’s mates,\r\nand three other volunteers,--singing Christmas carols, and making “a\r\nspecial stay outside the captain’s cabin.” In the forenoon prayers\r\nwere said on the lower deck; after which the captain and officers\r\nvisited the men’s mess, tasting the Christmas pudding, and examining\r\nthe tasteful decorations which had been improvised. Then the gifts\r\nwhich, in anticipation of the day, had been sent out by kindly English\r\nhearts, were distributed by the captain,--to each gift the name of the\r\nrecipient having been previously attached. This was an affecting scene;\r\nand hearty, though not without a touch of pathos in them, were the\r\ncheers given as the distribution took place; a distribution recalling\r\nso many “old familiar faces,” and all the sweet associations and gentle\r\nthoughts of home! Cheers were also raised for the captain and men of\r\nthe far-away _Alert_. Next, a choir was formed, and echo resounded\r\nwith the strains of “O the Roast Beef of Old England!” of which, no\r\ndoubt, many of the singers entertained a very affectionate remembrance.\r\nThe men dined at twelve and the officers at five, and the day seems in\r\nevery respect to have been most successful as a festival.\r\n\r\nA few particulars of the “situation” may here be given in the\r\nchaplain’s own words:--“We had brought fish, beef, and mutton from\r\nEngland,” he says, “all of which we hung up on one of the masts, and\r\nit was soon as hard as a brick, and perfectly preserved. We had also\r\nbrought some sheep from England with us, and they were killed from time\r\nto time. When we arrived in Discovery Bay, as we called it, six of them\r\nwere alive; but on being landed they were worried by the dogs, and had\r\nto be slaughtered. During the winter the men had to fetch ice from a\r\nberg about half a mile distant from the ship, in order to melt it for\r\nfresh water.”\r\n\r\nAt last the long Arctic night came to an end. It was with emotions of\r\nhope and gratitude and joy that the explorers welcomed the first rays\r\nof the returning sun on the last day of February. For four months they\r\nhad lived in obscurity and gloom, with the exception of such relief as\r\nthe stars and the moon had occasionally afforded. On the day of the\r\nsun’s return to the Polar World, it was known that it would rise at\r\nabout twelve o’clock, and everybody ascended the hills for the purpose\r\nof hailing the glorious spectacle. The mists and fogs, however, baffled\r\ntheir expectations; and though they _felt_ its influence, they did\r\nnot see it for some days after it had mounted above the horizon.\r\n\r\nNews was brought from the _Alert_ by two officers and two men\r\ntowards the end of March. They had accomplished the journey with the\r\nthermometer at 40° below zero, and had occupied six days in making\r\nit. The officers were Lieutenant Rawson and Mr. Egerton, who had\r\nstarted at first in company with Petersen, the interpreter, but had\r\nbeen compelled to return with him, as already narrated, because he was\r\nseverely frost-bitten. Directly they returned to the _Discovery_,\r\npreparations were made for sending out the sledge-parties. Two officers\r\nand three men, with a dog-sledge, started across Robeson Channel to\r\nHall’s Rest, the winter quarters of the _Polaris_, to report\r\non the stores left by the American vessel, which the United States\r\nGovernment had placed at the disposal of the British expedition. They\r\nreappeared on the fifth day, with the information that they had found\r\nbiscuit, pemmican, preserved meat, molasses, and other articles. They\r\nhad lived in a wooden observatory that they found erected there.\r\nCaptain Hall’s grave was in excellent preservation; and they set up a\r\nhead-board, with an inscription on it, to mark its situation.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Beaumont and Mr. Coppinger, the surgeon, each\r\nwith an eight-man sledge--or, rather, with seven men besides\r\nthemselves--started for the _Alert_, in quest of the other\r\nsledge which had wintered with that vessel; their design being to\r\ncross Robeson Channel, and explore the North Greenland coast. In this\r\njourney, owing to the “hummocky” character of the ice, they spent\r\ntwelve days.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, a third party, consisting of a twelve-man sledge and\r\nan eight-man sledge, with two officers, proceeded to survey the shores\r\nof Lady Franklin Sound. The captain accompanied them in the eight-man\r\nsledge, and was absent about a week; but the twelve-man sledge, which\r\nhad gone merely to carry stores and provisions for the other, did not\r\nreturn for a fortnight, the sledge having been damaged, and one of the\r\nmarines severely frost-bitten in the heel. The other sledge, after an\r\nabsence of about four weeks, returned in safety,--having discovered\r\nthat Lady Franklin Strait, as the Americans call it, was a sound or\r\nfiord about sixty miles long. They had fallen in with some musk-oxen,\r\nwhich were too wild to be got at; and had seen three or four glaciers,\r\nand hills three thousand feet in height.\r\n\r\nAbout June the warm summer began to assert itself, and in the rays\r\nof the sun their icehouses melted away, like the baseless fabric of\r\na vision. So the sledging-party last spoken of adventured across the\r\nice to Polaris Bay, taking with them a life-boat as a precaution (for\r\nthe ice might at any time have broken up), and a supply of provisions\r\nfor the use of the North Greenland expedition. This work done, they\r\nreturned to the ship, leaving behind them two officers and three men,\r\nwho pushed up Petermann Fiord for about eight miles, until arrested by\r\nthe impenetrable barrier of a huge glacier.\r\n\r\nOn returning from their explorations they found that Lieutenant\r\nNewsome, with four men, of whom one had died of scurvy on the way,\r\nhad accidentally separated from the North Greenland party, and reached\r\nPetermann Fiord on the 3rd of June. All were seriously ill of scurvy,\r\nexcept Mr. Rawson and a marine. Under Dr. Coppinger’s skill and\r\ncare, however, they recovered. As soon as possible, the doctor, with\r\nMr. Newsome and the Eskimos, started in a dog-sledge to gather some\r\ninformation about the other members of the North Greenland party. In\r\na day or two they fell in with them; and not too soon, for all were\r\nthoroughly exhausted. They had abandoned everything, and when the\r\ndoctor arrived were without food. Four of them, who were accommodated\r\non the sledge, were broken down with scurvy, and two others had been\r\nattacked slightly. What was to be done in this critical position of\r\naffairs? At first it was thought advisable to remain on the spot\r\nfor a while, and see if the Eskimos could shoot a seal. But a day’s\r\nexperience showed that this plan would not answer; and they then\r\nresolved to carry the two worst invalids on the dog-sledge to Hall’s\r\nRest. This was accomplished, and the poor fellows seemed to grow better\r\nwhen nourished by seal-soup and proper food; but on the following\r\nmorning one of them sank and died. The life of the other hung for some\r\ntime in the balance. The whole company were now invalided; and Hall’s\r\nRest might fitly have been termed Hall’s Hospital.\r\n\r\nA few days--weary, melancholy days--having elapsed, an officer, with\r\na couple of men, was sent across to the ship to report the serious\r\ncondition of affairs. As it was the end of June, the ice had broken\r\nup in many places, and the traject of the strait was not accomplished\r\nwithout difficulty, and frequent immersions in the water. No sooner did\r\nCaptain Stephenson learn how the party were situated, than he set out,\r\nwith seven men, to carry a supply of medicines, provisions, and various\r\ncomforts. They had with them a boat and a sledge on a four-wheeled car,\r\nand in this they crossed the land to the margin of the sea, a distance\r\nof about six miles. Sometimes the boat was called into requisition to\r\ncarry themselves and the sledge from floe to floe. With half of the men\r\nthey returned in a few days, leaving the rest in charge of Lieutenant\r\nBeaumont and Dr. Coppinger, until they had made more progress towards\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\nEarly in August an officer arrived from the _Alert_, to report\r\nthat she had moved southward, and was only about ten miles distant;\r\nand that Captain Nares, considering the main objects of the expedition\r\nsecured, had decided on returning to England. About the same time\r\nreturned the North Greenland party, their provisions having failed\r\nthem. A few days later, and, having made her way through the broken\r\nice, the _Alert_ joined the _Discovery_ in Discovery Bay.\r\nMr. Beaumont’s party next arrived; and both vessels prepared for the\r\nhomeward voyage. They left Discovery Bay, as we shall see, on the 28th\r\nof August.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet us now return to the _Alert_, which we left embedded in the\r\nice of the North Polar Ocean.\r\n\r\nHer crew made shift to spend a tolerably merry winter, availing\r\nthemselves of the usual resources of Arctic explorers under similar\r\nconditions. The day’s order was much as follows:--At 6.45 A.M.\r\nthe commander was called, and all hands were piped up on deck; and the\r\nhammocks having been previously stowed away and the decks cleansed,\r\neverybody sat down, with vigorous appetite, to breakfast. The\r\nsteerage and lower deck were afterwards cleared up, and soon after 9\r\nA.M. the men were told off for their respective daily duties.\r\nAt 10 A.M. another general parade of the crew was summoned,\r\nand, as a preventive against scurvy, the day’s dose of lime juice\r\nwas administered. Then the crew went to quarters; the usual careful\r\ninspection took place; and the chaplain read prayers. At one o’clock\r\nthe deck was cleared, and “dinner smoked upon the board.” On days when\r\nthe darkness was not too intense the crew turned out to work upon the\r\nice, or took their turn at walking exercise and amusements. They were\r\nthus occupied until supper, which was served at about five o’clock;\r\nand followed by evening school, the duties of which proved equally\r\nagreeable to the officers who taught and the men who learned. Soon\r\nafter nine the officers in charge inspected the ship to see that all\r\nwas quiet for the night. At ten out went the lights of the chief petty\r\nofficers, and at eleven those of the wardroom.\r\n\r\nThis daily routine was freely interrupted on festival occasions.\r\nGuy Fawkes’ Day was celebrated as hilariously as by the men of the\r\n_Discovery_; and it is a curious illustration of the strength of\r\nold English traditions, that the merry-making customs of the Fifth of\r\nNovember should be thus closely observed by both the ice-bound vessels.\r\nDue honours were also paid to Father Christmas; nor was New-Year’s Day\r\nforgotten. Dramatic talent existed among the men of the _Alert_\r\nin sufficient force to provide a regular dramatic company. The “Royal\r\nArctic Theatre” was erected in Funnel Row, and entertainments given\r\nweekly. The programmes of the “Thursday Pops,” as they were commonly\r\ncalled, were thrown off at a printing-press established in Trap Lane\r\nby Messrs. Giffard and Simmons; and from one of these we gather that\r\nthe Royal Arctic Theatre opened for the season “under the distinguished\r\npatronage of Captain Nares, the members of the Arctic Expedition, and\r\nall the nobility and gentry of the neighbourhood,” on the 18th of\r\nNovember 1875. The orchestra consisted of one eminent pianist, Signor\r\nAldrichi (Lieutenant Aldrich); and the scenic artist was Dr. Moss.\r\nThe performances commenced at 7.30; and “sledges” might be ordered at\r\nnine o’clock. They were by no means wholly dramatic. The bill of fare\r\nincluded scientific and historical lectures, readings and recitations,\r\nsongs and instrumental music, ranging from grave to gay, from lively to\r\nsevere; and now and then, to draw a bumper house, some such attraction\r\nas feats of legerdemain by “the real Wizard of the North, on his way\r\nto the Hyperborean Regions;” acrobatic feats by “the Bounding Brothers\r\nof the Frigid Zone;” or the vocal performances of the “Pale-o’-Christy\r\nMinstrels,” who “never sing in London.” The plays produced were an\r\noriginal burlesque operetta, “The Vulgar Little Boy; or, Weeping Bill”\r\n(founded on Barham’s popular “Misadventures at Margate”), written\r\nexpressly by the ship’s chaplain, the Rev. W. H. Pullen, author of the\r\nwell-known political squib, “Dame Europa’s School;” “Aladdin; or, The\r\nWonderful Scamp;” “Boots at the Swan;” and “The Area Belle.” The last\r\nand grand night was March 2nd, 1876,--when Captain Nares lectured on\r\n“The Palæocrystic Sea, and Sledging Experiences;” and after a variety\r\nof songs and readings, the company and audience sang a grand choral\r\nstrain, “The Palæocrystic Chorus,” which we borrow from the pages of\r\nthe _Graphic_:--\r\n\r\n        “Not very long ago,\r\n        On the six-foot floe\r\n    Of the Palæocrystic Sea,\r\n        Two ships did ride\r\n        ’Mid the crushing of the tide,\r\n    The _Alert_ and the _Discovery_.\r\n\r\n        “The sun never shone\r\n        Their gallant crews upon\r\n    For a hundred and forty-two days;\r\n        But no darkness and no hummocks\r\n        Their merry hearts could flummox,\r\n    So they set to work and acted plays.\r\n\r\n        “There was music and song\r\n        To help the hours along,\r\n    Brought forth from the good ship’s store;\r\n        And each man did his best\r\n        To amuse and cheer the rest,\r\n    And ‘nobody can’t do more.’\r\n\r\n        “Here’s a health to _Marco Polo_;\r\n        May he reach his northern goal oh!\r\n    And advance the flag of England into realms unknown;\r\n        May the _Challenger_ be there\r\n        All courses bold to dare,\r\n    And _Victoria_ be victorious in the Frozen Zone.\r\n\r\n        “May our _Poppie_ be in sight\r\n        With her colours streaming bright;\r\n    And the _Bulldog_ tug on merrily from strand to strand;\r\n        And the _Alexandra_ brave\r\n        See our banner proudly wave,\r\n    O’er the highest cliffs and summits of the northernmost land.\r\n\r\n        “Here’s a health to Hercules,\r\n        Whom the autumn blast did freeze,\r\n    And all our gallant fellows by the frost laid low.\r\n        Just wait a little longer,\r\n        Till they get a trifle stronger,\r\n    And they’ll never pull the worse for having lost a toe.\r\n\r\n        “Here’s a health with three times three\r\n        To the brave _Discovery_,\r\n    And our merry, merry guests so truly welcome here;\r\n        And a brimming bumper yet\r\n        To our gallant little pet,\r\n    The lively _Clements Markham_ with its bold charioteer.\r\n\r\n        “Here’s a health to all true blue,\r\n        To the officers and crew,\r\n    Who man this expedition neat and handy oh!\r\n        And may they ever prove,\r\n        Both in Sledging and in Love,\r\n    That the tars of old Britannia are the dandy oh!”\r\n\r\nIn explanation of some passages in the foregoing spirited effusion,\r\nwe may state that the six sledges belonging to the _Alert_ were named\r\nrespectively, _Marco Polo_, _Victoria_, _Challenger_, _Poppie_,\r\n_Bulldog_, and _Alexandra_. “Hercules” appears to have been the\r\nnickname of one of the strong men of the ship.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Alert_ wintered so far north, that its officers and\r\nmen failed to meet with some of the usual accessories of a Polar\r\nexpedition. There were no Polar bears; no Eskimos; even auroral\r\ndisplays were infrequent. On the other hand, the darkness is described\r\nas not having been particularly dense. The reflection of the snow, and\r\nthe keen “light of stars,” considerably mitigated the “deep obscure;”\r\nand once in every fourteen days the splendour of the moon illuminated\r\nthe weird outlines of the monotonous Arctic scenery.\r\n\r\nSome sledging was done in the autumn, though spring is the season when\r\nit can best be undertaken. The _Alert_ was no sooner made all snug\r\nin her winter quarters, than sledging-parties carried provisions and\r\nboats along the shore both northward and westward, ready for use by\r\nexpeditions in the following spring; the depôt being planted within a\r\nmile of the farthest northern position hitherto attained by civilized\r\nman. After a terrible journey of twenty days’ duration, the travellers\r\nreturned on the 14th of October, just two days after the disappearance\r\nof the sun. The snow fell heavily, and, by protecting the sloppy ice\r\nfrom the intense frost, rendered travelling difficult. The men’s shoes\r\ngot thoroughly wet; hence several were frost-bitten, and one officer\r\nand two men, on their return, were compelled to undergo amputation.\r\nBeneath the cliffs lay great dense, deep snow-wreaths, and in many\r\nplaces a road had to be excavated to the depth of six feet. The men\r\nsunk to their waists. The sledge was often completely buried. It needed\r\nall Lieutenant Rawson’s resolution and patience to bring back his\r\nlittle company in safety.\r\n\r\nThe main sledging-party, under Commander Markham, with Lieutenants\r\nParr and May, and twenty-five men, left the _Alert_ on the 25th\r\nof September, for the purpose of establishing a depôt at Cape Joseph\r\nHenry. They advanced three miles beyond Sir Edward Parry’s northernmost\r\npoint, and, from a mountain 2000 feet high, sighted land towards\r\nthe west-north-west, as far as lat. 83° 7’ N., but saw none to the\r\nnorthward.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the return of the sun on the 29th of February, Captain Nares began\r\nhis preparations for the spring sledging-expeditions, organizing two\r\nmain detachments: one, bound northward, under Commander Markham and\r\nLieutenant Parr, with fifteen men, supported by Dr. Moss and Mr. White,\r\nwith two seven-man sledges; and another, bound westward, consisting of\r\ntwo seven-man sledges, led by Lieutenants Aldrich and Giffard.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of March, Lieutenant Rawson and Mr. Egerton, as\r\nalready narrated, started off to open up communication with the\r\n_Discovery_, but were compelled to return by the illness of\r\nPetersen, whom they nursed on the way with womanlike tenderness and\r\ndevotion. In the following week, accompanied by Simmons, of the\r\n_Alert_, and Regan, of the _Discovery_, they resumed their\r\nadventurous track across the hummocky ice, with the temperature 40°\r\nbelow zero, enduring much, but pushing forward undauntedly. When their\r\ncomrades of the _Discovery_ condoled with them on account of\r\nfrost-bitten cheeks, and noses, and fingers, it was with the frank,\r\nblithe heroism of the true British seaman that Lieutenant Rawson\r\nreplied,--“Well, at least we feel that the cheers from Southsea beach\r\nhave been fairly earned.”\r\n\r\nThe sledging-expeditions began in earnest in the first week of April,\r\nonly a few men being left on board each ship. Captain Stephenson,\r\nof the _Discovery_, paid a visit to the _Alert_, and also\r\ncrossed Hall’s Basin twice to Greenland. Captain Nares, with Captain\r\nFeilden, was not less energetic; and for a considerable area round the\r\ntwo ships all was activity and motion. When at Polaris Bay, Captain\r\nStephenson, in memory of the gallant and unfortunate Hall, hoisted the\r\nAmerican ensign, and erected a brass tablet above the explorer’s lonely\r\ngrave. It bears the following inscription:--\r\n\r\n“Sacred to the memory of Captain C. F. Hall, of the U.S. ship\r\n_Polaris_, who sacrificed his life in the advancement of science\r\non November 8, 1871. This tablet has been erected by the British Polar\r\nExpedition of 1875, who, following in his footsteps, have profited by\r\nhis experience.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be noted here, in illustration of the labour attendant on the\r\nequipment of an Arctic sledge-party, and the despatch of provisions\r\nfor their sustenance, that, in order to support the expeditions on the\r\nnorth coast of Greenland and in Petermann Fiord, “Robeson Channel was\r\ncrossed eleven times from the position of the _Alert_ to a depôt\r\nestablished north of Cape Brevoort, and Hall’s Basin eleven times\r\nbetween Discovery Bay and Polaris Bay; making a total of twenty-two\r\nsledge-parties crossing the straits, including the transporting of\r\ntwo boats. The main depôt at Cape Joseph Henry, for the support of\r\nthe northern and western divisions, thirty-seven miles from the\r\n_Alert_, was visited by sixteen different sledges.”\r\n\r\nOur travellers did not fail to examine the various cairns erected by\r\nthe seamen of the _Polaris_. At one place a box chronometer was\r\nfound to be in excellent order, though it had undergone the test of\r\nfour Arctic winters. And some wheat, which the _Polaris_ had\r\nbrought out in order to ascertain the effect upon it of exposure to\r\nextreme cold, was successfully cultivated under a glass shade by Dr.\r\nNinnis--almost as interesting an experiment in its way as the sowing\r\nand successful harvesting of Mummy wheat, the grains found in ancient\r\nEgyptian sepulchres.\r\n\r\nThe British expedition had advanced so far north that it was beyond the\r\nlife-limit of bears, birds, and even seals; and the sledging-parties,\r\nunable therefore to obtain any fresh game, were severely attacked by\r\nscurvy. This fell disease invariably broke out when its victims were\r\nfarthest from any assistance. The journeys back to the ships were\r\nconsequently undertaken, as we have already pointed out, by men whose\r\nstrength decreased daily; and the burden became all the greater as man\r\nafter man was smitten down, and, to save his life, placed upon the\r\nsledge. Great was the alarm on board the _Alert_, when, towards\r\nthe close of the 8th of June, Lieutenant Parr suddenly presented\r\nhimself. He was alone. Where were his comrades? What calamity had\r\nbefallen them? He soon explained that he had undertaken a journey\r\nof thirty-five miles, toiling for twenty-two hours through mist and\r\ndrift and snow, and guided only by the fresh track of a stray wolf,\r\nto convey the news of the prostrated condition of the members of the\r\nnorthern expedition. Preparations were immediately made for hastening\r\nto their assistance. With the help of the officers, who all volunteered\r\nto drag the sledges, Captain Nares was able by midnight to start with\r\ntwo strong relief-parties--Messrs. Egerton, Conybeare, Wootton, and\r\nWhite, the officers who could best be spared from the ship, taking\r\ntheir places at the drag-ropes; and Lieutenant May and Dr. Moss pushing\r\nforward with a supply of medicines in the dog-sledge.\r\n\r\nSuch was the alacrity and energy of the two latter, that they contrived\r\nto reach Commander Markham’s encampment within fifty hours of the\r\ndeparture of Lieutenant Parr; though, unfortunately, not in time to\r\nsave the life of one of the marines, who but a few hours before had\r\nexpired and been buried in the floe. On the remainder of the stricken\r\ncompany, their arrival, however, had a most beneficial influence; and\r\nwhen, early the next day, Captain Nares came up to their relief, their\r\ncourage and resolution, which had never deserted them, were quickened\r\nto the utmost, and even the invalids threw off that dread depression an\r\nattack of scurvy invariably produces. On the morning of the 14th all\r\nwere once more safe on board the ship, and offering up their heartfelt\r\nthanksgiving to God.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nares furnishes some particulars which illustrate very vividly\r\nthe terrible experiences of the adventurous sledge-party, and also\r\nthe ravages which scurvy never fails to commit. He says that of the\r\nseventeen officers and men who originally left the _Alert_, only\r\nfive--namely, three officers and two men--were able to drag the sledges\r\nalongside. Three others--heroes as true as any of those whom Homer has\r\nmade famous!--manfully kept on their feet to the last, enduring the\r\nextreme of pain and fatigue rather than, by riding on the sledges,\r\nincrease the burden their weakened companions had to drag. They were\r\njust able to crawl on board ship without assistance. The remaining\r\neight had struggled gallantly, but the disease had proved too much for\r\nthem, and they were carried on the sledges. Out of the whole number,\r\nonly two officers escaped the ravages of scurvy. After due rest and\r\nmedical attention, the chief carpenter’s mate returned to his duty,\r\nand three others recovered so as to be able to wait on their sick\r\ncomrades; but Jolliffe, a petty officer, who had nobly borne up against\r\nthe disease while actively employed, when his legs became cramped from\r\nresting on board proved to be one of the most lingering cases.\r\n\r\nSurely the nation will never begrudge the cost of expeditions which\r\ngive such occasion for the display of the most generous unselfishness\r\nand the noblest devotion!\r\n\r\nThese sledge-journeys were performed in the face of tremendous\r\ndifficulties. Beyond the mere coast-belt, there was little smooth ice;\r\nthe tolerably level floes or fields, usually about six feet above the\r\nneighbouring ice, seldom measured a mile across. Their surfaces were\r\nthickly covered with rounded blue-topped ice-humps, averaging twenty\r\nfeet high; which lay sometimes in ranges, and sometimes a hundred to\r\ntwo hundred yards apart, the intervening spaces being filled with\r\nwind-driven snow, and the whole resembling a gusty ocean suddenly\r\nstiffened into rest.[12] Between these floes, like an embankment\r\nof rude formation, extended a vast pile of the wreck and refuse of\r\nprevious summers’ broken-up pack-ice, regelated during the winter into\r\none rugged and confused mass of angular blocks of various heights up to\r\nforty and fifty feet, and of every imaginable variety of configuration,\r\nlike the disrupted lava at the mouth of a crater. These were\r\ninterspersed with a continuous series of “steep-sided snow-drifts,”\r\nwhich stretched downwards from the highest summit of the ice-chaos\r\nuntil lost in the general level at a distance of about one hundred\r\nyards. It may be conceived that it was not easy to find a passage for\r\nthe sledges through these labyrinths of ice and snow. The snow-slopes\r\nwere by no means an assistance, for the winter-winds coming chiefly\r\nfrom the west, and the course of the sledges being due north, they had\r\nto be encountered almost at right angles. Consequently, the journey was\r\nan incessant struggle with ever-recurring obstacles; as fast as one had\r\nbeen conquered, another presented itself. The pickaxes were in constant\r\nrequisition, either to cut a way through the packed-up ice, or out of\r\nthe perpendicular side of the high floes. Instead of a steady advance,\r\nthe whole party were frequently detained half a day by the necessity of\r\nfacing the sledge and hauling it forward a few feet at a time. These\r\nconsiderations will enable the reader to judge how great must have been\r\nthe “pluck,” persistence, and energy which could accomplish a journey\r\nof seventy miles in such exceptional circumstances.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nares observes--and his eulogium will be endorsed by the\r\nreader--that no two officers could have accomplished this laborious\r\nenterprise with greater ability or courage than Commander Markham and\r\nLieutenant Parr. And it is but just that the services of Rawlings and\r\nLawrence, the captains of the two sledges, should be put on record.\r\nIn addition to their general cheerfulness and good-humour,--qualities\r\nwhich always help to lighten difficult work,--to their care and skill\r\nwere due the safe return of the sledges, on which the lives of all\r\ndepended--safe, uninjured, and in as serviceable a state as when\r\nthey left the ship, notwithstanding the terrible character of the\r\nroad they had travelled. To such men as these, and to the brave,\r\npatient, resolute sledge-crews generally, we owe the tribute of our\r\npraise. However severe their privations, they never complained. During\r\nthis memorable journey to penetrate to the north over the rugged\r\nPolar Oceanic ice, a journey in which the “pluck” and determination\r\nof the British seaman were most conspicuously displayed, day after\r\nday, against obstacles which might well have been regarded as\r\ninsurmountable, the two officers and their brave followers succeeded in\r\nadvancing the Union Jack to latitude 83° 20’ 26″ N.,--or within four\r\nhundred miles of the North Pole.\r\n\r\nIn order to attain this advanced post, the present boundary-mark of\r\ngeographical research in that direction, the total distance travelled\r\nwas two hundred and seventy-six miles on the outward, and two hundred\r\nand forty-five miles on the homeward journey, though the farthest\r\ndirect distance from the ship did not exceed seventy-three miles. The\r\nresult of labour so colossal and sufferings so severe would seem to\r\nbe, that we must consider a long journey over the Polar pack-ice, with\r\nsledge and boat, to be impracticable at any season of the year. As the\r\nsledges were necessarily advanced each stage singly, we are able to\r\ncalculate the exact rate of progression which may be expected, if it\r\nshould be thought desirable to push forward with light sledges, without\r\nany additional means of returning later in the season in the event of\r\na disruption of ice in the rear. The maximum attained by Commander\r\nMarkham was two and three-quarter miles a day; the mean rate being one\r\nmile and a quarter.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of scurvy rendered Captain Nares very anxious as to the\r\nwelfare of Lieutenant Aldrich’s company on their return from the\r\nwestward; and the more so, when it was found that the cairn erected\r\nover his depôt of provisions, thirty miles to the north-west, remained\r\nuntouched on the day appointed for his arrival there. Lieutenant\r\nMay, with the dog-sledge, and three robust men, were therefore sent\r\nto meet him. On the 20th of June the two parties met at the depôt,\r\nand signalled the welcome fact to Captain Nares. It was fortunate\r\nthat Lieutenant Aldrich returned when he did, for on the following\r\nday a rapid thaw set in, with the wind from the southward, and the\r\nsnow-valleys were rendered impassable for sledges for the rest of the\r\nseason. His party, like Commander Markham’s, were stricken with scurvy,\r\nfour of them lying helpless on the dog-sledge; and Lieutenant May’s\r\narrival proved most opportune.\r\n\r\nHaving now assembled all his company on board the _Alert_, Captain\r\nNares was called upon to decide whether it was possible to carry the\r\nwork of exploration further, or whether the expedition should return to\r\nEngland. Owing to the absence of any land with a northward trend, and\r\nthe innavigable character of the Polar pack-ice, he concluded that on\r\nneither side of Smith Sound could any ship advance further northward\r\nthan the _Alert_ had done; and also, that from no secure position\r\nin Smith Sound was it possible for sledges to advance nearer to the\r\nPole. If the expedition remained in the vicinity for another season,\r\nthe exploration of the shores of Grant Land might be pursued to the\r\nsouth-west, and of Greenland to the north-east, but not more than fifty\r\nmiles beyond the points already attained. In the weakened condition of\r\nthe crew, and for so small an additional gain, Captain Nares decided\r\nthat it would be unwise to risk another winter. As soon as the ice\r\nbroke up, “Ho for merry England!”\r\n\r\n\r\nA regular thaw did not set in until the last week of June. Water\r\nflowed in the ravines on the 1st of July. After that date the thaw\r\ngradually extended, and increased in rapidity; and on the 23rd a\r\nstrong south-west wind drove the pack a mile away from the shore. On\r\nthe 26th a cairn was erected on the shore, and a record of the work of\r\nthe expedition deposited in it; and on the 31st, a passage having been\r\ncleared through the winter-barrier of icebergs, the _Alert_, with\r\na strong south-west wind filling her canvas, pushed out into Robeson\r\nChannel on her homeward voyage. After a run of two miles along-shore,\r\nthrough a fairly open way between the pack-ice and what Dr. Kane calls\r\n“the ice-foot,” she was checked in her course by a heavy floe one and\r\na half mile in diameter, which almost touched the land; and no other\r\nshelter being available, she lay up in a small cove or creek, among a\r\ngroup of icebergs that had gone ashore in the shallows.\r\n\r\nThe obstructive floe showed signs of movement early on the morning of\r\nAugust 1st; and soon afterwards went away to the northward at the rate\r\nof a mile and a half an hour, grinding along the ice-foot somewhat\r\nalarmingly as it advanced towards the ship. Steam being up, however,\r\nthe _Alert_ cast off her moorings, and succeeded in edging between\r\nthe land and the floe; while the latter swung round in-shore with a\r\nviolent jerk, close to the position which the ship had previously\r\noccupied.\r\n\r\nWe may note here the difference which Captain Nares insists upon\r\nbetween an ordinary floe, such as is commonly met with in Arctic\r\nwaters, and the ancient Polar Sea ice. The former seldom exceeds six\r\nfeet in thickness, and breaks into fragments against an obstruction,\r\nor may be charged by a steamship; but the latter, being some eighty or\r\none hundred feet thick, lifts all impediments out of its course,--or,\r\nso to speak, throws them disdainfully away. “Such was the case on this\r\noccasion: the Polar floe, which,” says Captain Nares, “we only escaped\r\nby a few yards, on nipping against the heavy breastwork of isolated\r\nfloebergs lining the coast, some of them forty feet high and many\r\nthousand tons in weight, which had lately formed our protection from\r\nthe smaller ice-pieces, tilted them over one after another, and forced\r\nthem higher up the land-slope, like a giant at play, without receiving\r\nthe slightest harm itself--not a piece breaking away. It was most\r\nprovidential that, by its twisting round, the _Alert_ was enabled\r\nto escape out of the trap in which she was enclosed.”\r\n\r\nThe shore here presented a formidable line of ice-cliff, from twenty\r\nto forty feet in height, striking down into clear blue water ten to\r\ntwenty fathoms deep. The _Alert_ kept onward, so close to the\r\ncliff that the boats hung at her quarter frequently touched it, until\r\nagain brought to a stop near Cape Union by the accumulation of the\r\npack. Her captain, however, was able here to secure her abreast of a\r\nlarge stream, the current of which had undermined the ice-cliff for\r\nsome fifty yards, and floated it off to sea, leaving a kind of cove\r\nor harbour where the ship could be laid alongside the beach in such a\r\nmanner that, if the pack struck her, it could only force her on shore.\r\nThe reader of Arctic voyages will remember that a somewhat similar\r\nposition was once occupied by Sir Edward Parry’s ship, under somewhat\r\nsimilar circumstances.\r\n\r\nWhen the tide had turned, and began to flow southward, it broke up\r\nthe ice all around Cape Union, and formed a narrow water-way, which\r\noffered Captain Nares a chance of escape. Steam was got up immediately,\r\nbut, owing to unavoidable delay in shipping the rudder, the ice closed\r\nin before the ship could be carried round. Her last stage was worse\r\nthan her first; for she was now cut off from her safe little port,\r\nand no better shelter was available than a slight hollow or break in\r\nthe ice-cliff. Here, however, she was brought-to, with the ice-blocks\r\nswirling past her at a distance of twenty yards. At low water Captain\r\nNares cast off, and bored some way into the pack, so that the\r\n_Alert_ might drift round the cape with the southern tide. At\r\nabout a quarter of a mile from the land, she drove along with the ice;\r\nand when the tide slackened, steamed out of the pack before it began\r\nto set to the northward. Then, keeping close in to the ice-foot, she\r\nkept slowly on her course to the southward, the water-way broadening\r\nas she approached Lincoln Bay, which was crossed without difficulty.\r\nWhen within five miles of Cape Beechey, the tide turned; but after a\r\nshort delay a channel opened, allowing the ship to round the cape.\r\nAt this point the ice-cliff ends, and the land slopes gently to the\r\nshore--which is protected by a barrier of floebergs, similar to, but\r\nsmaller than, those which line the shore of the Polar Sea. Here the\r\nship was made fast in three fathoms water, within twenty yards of the\r\nshore, about a mile to the south of the cape.\r\n\r\nWe dwell on these particulars in order that our readers may form some\r\nidea of the difficulties of Arctic voyaging. The words, “She forced her\r\nway through the ice,” afford no conception whatever of the obstacles\r\nthat have to be overcome, and the dangers that have to be avoided, by a\r\nship navigating in the midst of pack-ice and ice-floes; or of the skill\r\nand vigilance and patience on the part of officers and men, by which\r\nonly can the enterprise be brought to a successful issue.\r\n\r\nWe are told that on August the 4th snow-squalls blew from the\r\nsouth-west. As the ice had closed in around the ship, holding it in a\r\nvice, the sportsmen of the party landed, and visited some neighbouring\r\nlakes in search of game. They found a number of wild geese, and killed\r\nfifty-seven, which supplied a welcome addition to the ordinary bill of\r\nfare. Mr. Egerton and a seaman were sent off to the _Discovery_,\r\nthen about twenty miles distant, with orders for her to prepare for the\r\nhomeward voyage. We have already related how they reached the ship in\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nWhile the _Alert_ was thus imprisoned, the huge pack-ice in the\r\noffing was carried up and down the strait by the tidal movement, the\r\nwind having the effect of increasing the velocity of the current\r\nand the duration of its flow both northward and southward. The ice\r\ngenerally was of a lighter character than that in the Polar Sea; but\r\nmany heavy Polar floes were driven southward by the gale, and set into\r\nLady Franklin Sound and Archer Fiord rather than down Kennedy Channel.\r\nLady Franklin Sound, indeed, seems to be the receptacle of all the\r\nheavy ice that comes south through Robeson Channel; retaining it until\r\nthe prevailing westerly winds carry it once more to the northward,\r\nand empty the Sound, previous to its being refilled on the return of\r\nthe northerly gales. It is only, says Captain Nares, in seasons when\r\nnortherly winds occur more frequently than westerly ones, that any\r\nconsiderable quantities of the huge Polar ice are drifted into Smith\r\nSound and Baffin Bay.\r\n\r\nThe gale of the 6th of August was very violent. The tide rushing\r\nsouthward, drove a succession of heavy floe-pieces against the small\r\nbergs that protected the ship, and capsized one of them completely. It\r\nwas firmly aground when struck by the point of a large floe; but such\r\nwas the force of the collision that it was reared erect in the air\r\nto its full height of at least sixty feet above water, when, turning\r\na complete somersault, like a practised gymnast, it came down on its\r\nback with a shock that shattered it into pieces, and raised a wave\r\nsufficient to roll the ship considerably. Into the gap thus caused\r\nmoved the ice, until at last it nipped the _Alert_, though not\r\ndangerously.\r\n\r\nThat same evening Lieutenant Rawson and two seamen arrived from the\r\n_Discovery_, with news of the ill-fortune that had overtaken the\r\nGreenland sledge-party.\r\n\r\nIt soon became apparent that there was no chance of releasing the\r\nice-bound ship except by cutting down the heavy floe that held her\r\nprisoner; and accordingly all hands were set to work. After three\r\ndays’ toil, so much of the floe was hewn away that at high water it\r\nfloated and set the ship free; at the same time the main pack moved\r\noff, and the _Alert_ steamed onward, rejoining her consort, the\r\n_Discovery_, on the 11th of August.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the invalids on board the _Alert_ were now removed to the\r\n_Discovery_, and Captain Nares remained at the entrance to\r\nthe harbour, prepared to cross to Polaris Bay, as soon as the ice\r\npermitted, to relieve Lieutenant Beaumont. As before stated, however,\r\nhe arrived on the 14th, and relieved the commander of the expedition\r\nof a serious anxiety. Both vessels were now ready to start, but the\r\nstate of the ice detained them until the 20th, when, a “lead” offering\r\nthrough the pack, away they steamed, and arrived close to Cape Lawrence\r\nwithout encountering any serious obstacle. Here their old enemy, the\r\nice, again opposed them; and Captain Nares found only the famous “three\r\ncourses” of a well-known statesman open to him: either to return\r\nnorth, to drive ahead into the pack, or make fast the ships to some\r\nof the grounded floebergs. This last expedient was adopted, and in a\r\nland-locked inner basin the _Alert_ and the _Discovery_ were\r\naccordingly secured. But, unfortunately, at the fall of high water a\r\npiece of ice pressed against the _Alert_, and at the same time its\r\nprotecting floeberg drove ashore. Result: the _Alert_ was aground\r\nforward, but with deep water under the stern. And before she could be\r\nreleased, the tide had fallen fourteen feet, so that the ship lay over\r\nat an angle of 22°, with fore-foot and keel exposed as far aft as the\r\nfore-channels. Nothing could be done until the tide rose. Then the ship\r\nwas lightened, and afterwards hauled off without having undergone any\r\ndamage.\r\n\r\nA passage again opened on the 22nd of August, and the two ships\r\nsteamed as far southward as Cape Collinson, with no other troubles\r\nthan dense snow-storms, mists, and strong head-winds. But off the\r\ncape, the _Alert_ having to back to escape a nip, she fouled the\r\n_Discovery_ for a moment; the latter escaping, however, with\r\nnothing worse than the loss of a boat’s davit.\r\n\r\nThe ice gradually breaking up before a strong south-west wind, the two\r\nships crossed Scoresby Bay, which was perfectly clear, but rolled with\r\na heavy sea. As they approached Cape Frazer, they were buffeted by a\r\nterrible gale, and put in to Maury Bay, anchoring among a quantity of\r\ngrounded ice. Three days were spent in arduous efforts to double Cape\r\nFrazer,--one of the _bêtes noires_ of Arctic navigators, because\r\nit is the meeting-point of the flood-tides, north and south, one from\r\nthe Polar Ocean and the other from the Atlantic,--and Cape Hayes, the\r\nboundary-mark of the channel. Then the voyagers, with glad hearts,\r\npassed into Smith Sound; and hugging the shore as closely as was safe,\r\narrived on the 29th at Prince Imperial Island, in Dobbin Bay, “every\r\none heartily thankful to be out of the pack, clear of the straggling\r\nicebergs, and for the ships to be secured to fixed ice once more.”\r\n\r\nThe temperature now sunk again below freezing-point. The brief\r\nArctic summer was over, and day and night the young sea-ice formed\r\ncontinuously. The mists that had hitherto accompanied the ships cleared\r\naway before a brisk northerly wind, and revealed a magnificent panorama\r\nof lofty mountains, white with shrouds of snow, and deep valleys filled\r\nwith colossal glaciers. One of these stretched downwards to the shore,\r\nand threw off great icebergs which floated or stranded in Dobbin Bay.\r\nIt was named after the Empress Eugénie, who had taken a lively personal\r\ninterest in the expedition.\r\n\r\nCrossing Dobbin Bay on the 1st of September, the voyagers came within a\r\nquarter of a mile of a depôt of provisions established near Cape Hawks\r\nin the previous autumn, and succeeded in removing a portion. A day or\r\ntwo later Captain Nares landed on Washington Island, and visited a\r\ncairn which he had raised there on the 12th of August 1865. He visited,\r\nalso, two old cairns erected by former explorers; the lichens with\r\nwhich they were gray proved that they were of earlier date than Dr.\r\nHayes’ expedition.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of September, by dint of steaming assiduously, the ships\r\nrammed their way through a lane of water to the westward of Cape Hawks,\r\nwhich was inconveniently obstructed by loose pieces of old ice. After\r\nrounding the cape, says the captain, the pack by drifting away from\r\nthe land had left unfrozen water and numerous detached small floes,\r\nwhich forced them to make a very serpentine course, and occasionally to\r\npass within thirty yards of the low ice-foot on the shore, fortunately\r\nalways finding deep water. In this way they reached Allman Bay,\r\nhalf-way between Cape Hawks and Franklin Pierce Bay. Meeting here with\r\na belt of new ice, the _Discovery_ was sent ahead; and under full\r\nsteam she forced a canal through the ice, which was from one to three\r\ninches thick. From the lofty hills in the interior a huge glacier leads\r\ndown to Allman Bay; and it is a noticeable fact that always in the\r\nneighbourhood of a glacier-stream the water was found nearly fresh, and\r\nof the temperature of 32°.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th our homeward-bound ships reached Norman Lockyer Island, on\r\nthe margin of Princess Marie Bay. The season was now far advanced, and\r\nas the slightest mistake might have led to the vessels being ice-bound\r\nfor the winter, the two captains ascended to the highest point of the\r\nisland to obtain some idea of the prospect before them. They were\r\nmuch relieved by seeing a large area of open water some twenty miles\r\ndistant, which they conjectured would extend to the mouth of Smith\r\nSound. No time was lost in getting under way; and the ships crossed\r\ntwo-thirds of the distance before they fell in with ice. By charging\r\nit under full steam, they cleared the obstacle, and then, through an\r\nopen-water channel, ran on to Cape Sabine.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of September they arrived off Cape Isabella, where they\r\nfound a small packet of letters and newspapers which had been left at\r\nthe depôt by the _Pandora_. The weather was now calm, and the wind\r\nfavourable. Sail was hoisted, therefore, as the supply of coal began\r\nto run short, and on the evening of the 12th the expedition reached\r\nBardin Bay. During the 13th and the 14th they worked southward into\r\nWolstenholm Sound; and thence, with a south-easterly wind, crossed to\r\nCape Byam Martin, which they reached on the 16th. Two days later they\r\nentered the well-known waters of Melville Bay; on the 25th they arrived\r\nat Disco, where, and afterwards at Egedesminde, they obtained some\r\nsmall supplies of coal.\r\n\r\nEgedesminde was left behind on the 2nd of October, and on the 4th the\r\ntwo ships recrossed the Arctic Circle--exactly fifteen months from\r\nthe time of crossing it on the outward voyage. Experiencing adverse\r\nwinds, they made but slow progress to the southward; and as the weather\r\nbecame warmer and damper, a few of the men suffered from rheumatism and\r\ncatarrhs. During a heavy gale on the 19th, the two ships separated;\r\nbut both, as we have seen, reached the shores of England in safety,\r\nwhere their gallant officers and crews met with the hearty welcome so\r\nthoroughly merited by their courage, perseverance, and heroic industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome notes on the general results obtained by the expedition in\r\nzoology, botany, and geology, have appeared in the _Academy_.\r\nThe two naturalists under whose care these departments were\r\nplaced,--Captain Feilden, in the _Alert_, and Mr. Hart, in the\r\n_Discovery_,--worked with unflagging energy and no small success.\r\n\r\nOf mammals, the species found farthest north were the Arctic fox, the\r\nwolf, the ermine, the Polar hare, the lemming, and the musk-ox,--all of\r\nwhich were seen on the shores of the great Polar Basin or Palæocrystic\r\nSea. No cetaceans were sighted north of Payer Harbour, near Cape\r\nSabine; a fact which renders all the more serious the gradual process\r\nof extermination of the Greenland (or right) whale in more southern\r\nlatitudes. The only seal found beyond Cape Union, in lat. 82° 15’ N.,\r\nwas the little ringed seal or “floe-rat” (_Phoca hispida_).\r\n\r\nSo far as the land extended, bird life prevailed; the species being the\r\nsnowy owl, the snow-bunting, and the ptarmigan. Full collections were\r\nmade of all the birds frequenting Smith Sound; and our naturalists had\r\nthe satisfaction of discovering the long-sought-for breeding-haunts of\r\nthe knott and sanderling.[13]\r\n\r\nFew species of marine fish were obtained, but “an interesting small\r\nsalmonoid” was met with in fresh-water lakes as far north as lat. 82°\r\n35’. A fine collection of marine invertebrates was secured by dredging\r\nand trawling; and the character of the sea-bottom from Baffin Bay up\r\nto lat. 83° 19’ N. was accurately ascertained by a series of careful\r\nsoundings.\r\n\r\nIn the department of botany our naturalists were rewarded by the\r\ndiscovery of between twenty and thirty species of phanerogamic plants\r\nbetween the parallels of 82° and 83°. Much richer and more varied\r\nresults were obtained in the cryptogamic flora.\r\n\r\nGeologically, the facts arrived at were of the utmost value. “The\r\nwhole west coast of Smith Sound, from Cape Isabella to Cape Union,\r\nhas been fully surveyed and mapped, and large collections have been\r\nmade both of fossils and rock-specimens; while the sledge-parties\r\nwhich explored the shore of the Polar Basin, both to east and west,\r\nbrought back sufficient material to determine the geological character\r\nof the country. Silurian limestones, richly fossiliferous, were the\r\nprevailing rocks along Smith Sound. Miocene deposits, _including a\r\ntwenty-foot seam of coal_, were found as far north as lat. 81° 44’.\r\nFrom the shales and sandstones of this formation a beautiful series\r\nof leaf-impressions were collected, illustrating the characteristic\r\nflora of the epoch, and presenting a remarkable demonstration of the\r\nexistence of a temperate climate within five hundred miles of the\r\npresent Pole at a comparatively recent geological time. Not less\r\nimportant are the indications of great recent changes in the elevation\r\nof the land afforded by the discovery of thick post-pliocene deposits,\r\nlying at a considerable elevation above the sea-level, and containing\r\nfossils similar to the existing marine fauna. Lastly, very interesting\r\nand suggestive observations have been made on glaciation and ice-action\r\nin general.”\r\n\r\nThis, of course, is but a summary, and a very brief and condensed one,\r\nof researches which have evidently been of the highest importance.\r\nAnd it might almost be said of the late expedition, that even had its\r\ngeographical discoveries been less valuable, its scientific results\r\nwould have entitled it to a foremost place in the annals of Arctic\r\nEnterprise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur record of Arctic expeditions will fitly close with a sketch of the\r\ncruise of the _Pandora_, a screw-yacht commanded by Captain Allen\r\nYoung, which left England in the summer of 1876, in order to open up\r\ncommunications with the Admiralty expedition.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    CHART\r\n    SHOWING THE DISCOVERIES\r\n    OF THE\r\n    BRITISH POLAR EXPEDITION\r\n    1875–76.\r\n\r\n   [_From Map accompanying Official Report published in\r\n   “Nature.”_]]\r\n\r\nCaptain Young left Upernavik on the evening of the 19th of July, and\r\nstood away to the northward--in bad weather, and with the wind blowing\r\na gale. Through vast fields of ice he threaded his way, sometimes under\r\nsail, sometimes under steam, until, on the morning of the 24th, he\r\nfound his ship completely surrounded, in lat. 75° 10’ N.\r\n\r\nNo time was lost in endeavouring to effect an escape by charging\r\nthe ice at full speed,--again and again returning to the onset; and\r\na slow but steady progress was being made, when the field in which\r\nthey were held fast, drifting before the gale, “collided” with a\r\ngroup of grounded bergs, and exposed the little vessel to such severe\r\npressure, that preparations were made for abandoning her. Provisions,\r\nammunition, camping and travelling gear, all were made ready, and the\r\nboats were lowered as far as possible at the davits. Meantime, heavy\r\ncharges of gunpowder were used to blast the ice where it pressed the\r\nship most severely; and the bergs taking a different direction, the\r\n_Pandora_ began to recover herself, and before night settled down\r\nnearly to her usual level. In the darkness of the night, with the wind\r\nhowling, and the snow and sleet driving in heavy showers, she moved\r\nahead with the pack; and in this way continued her progress until the\r\n27th, when the weather cleared, and Captain Young discovered that he\r\nhad advanced right into the heart of Melville Bay, with no water in\r\nsight. Full in view were Capes Walker and Melville, the Peaked Hill,\r\nand huge glacier-streams embedded in the intervening valleys. All\r\naround was one vast monotonous sheet of rugged ice. It was not until\r\nthe 29th that the _Pandora_, after many hairbreadth escapes, got\r\ninto open water, in lat. 75° 50’ N., and long. 64° 55’ W. While thus\r\nimprisoned in the grasp of the floe, the explorers killed only one\r\nPolar bear, four seals, and a few little auks.\r\n\r\nIn a clear sea they now stood away to the westward, passing Capes\r\nDudley, Digges, and Athol, and other headlands familiar in the records\r\nof Arctic adventure. At noon on the 31st, when off Wolstenholm Island,\r\nanother gale overtook them, increasing rapidly to almost hurricane\r\nfury. This was an unpleasant experience; for the deck was washed by\r\nheavy seas, and it was with the greatest difficulty they avoided coming\r\ninto collision with the icebergs which drifted rapidly through the snow\r\nand spray.\r\n\r\nReaching Cary Island, they landed to examine Captain Nares’ depôt of\r\nprovisions, and found it in good preservation. The cairn had not been\r\nvisited since Young’s call at the island on the 10th of September in\r\nthe previous year. Afterwards they made for Sutherland Island, where\r\nthey found a record of the American explorer, Captain Hartstene, dated\r\nAugust 16, 1855. It is with a curious feeling that, in these regions of\r\nalmost perpetual winter, the voyager comes upon such faint memorials of\r\nmen who, like him, have dared all the perils of ice-floes and icebergs,\r\nand adventured into seas far beyond the track of ordinary commercial\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nOn Littleton Island, a record of the expedition was found. The document\r\nwas dated July 28, 1875, and signed by Captain Nares; and it indicated\r\nthe course about to be taken by the ships under his orders. Owing to\r\nthe ice-encumbered condition of the straits, however, Captain Young\r\ncould not follow it up; and instead of crossing to Cape Isabella, he\r\nresolved to examine the coast in Hartstene Bay, in order to seek a\r\nharbour for the relief-ship which the Admiralty had intended to send\r\nout in 1877, in case of the non-return of the Polar Expedition. This\r\nwas found on the 4th of August, not far from the Eskimo settlement\r\nof Etah, and named after the _Pandora_. It would seem to offer\r\nevery advantage as winter quarters for Arctic discovery-ships; the\r\nsurrounding hills are “dotted with Arctic hares, appearing like\r\nsnow-balls on the luxurious vegetation.” The little auk breeds in\r\nthousands on the cliffs, eider fowl and guillemots haunt the waters,\r\nand the adjacent valleys and pastures are frequented by reindeer.\r\n\r\nCaptain Young next made for Cape Isabella, which he reached on the\r\n6th of August. Watchful eyes soon discovered a large cairn on the\r\nsummit of this headland. A boat was lowered, and the contents of the\r\ncairn soon obtained, while despatches and letters for Captain Nares’\r\nexpedition were left in their stead. Then the _Pandora_ steamed\r\nto the northward; but, owing to the adverse winds and the accumulated\r\nice, could make no way, and was forced back to Cape Isabella. Another\r\nattempt was made to the eastward, and for several days the gallant\r\nlittle ship crossed and recrossed the straits, through the pack, always\r\nbeset with ice, and frequently enshrouded in impenetrable fogs. No\r\nfewer than three times was she compelled to take shelter in Pandora\r\nHarbour. On the 19th she was driven back to the northward of Littleton\r\nIsland, and Captain Young and some of his officers took the opportunity\r\nof visiting the _Polaris_ camp. Nothing remained of the house\r\nerected by Captain Buddington except a few broken boards. The rocks\r\nwere strewn with pieces of metal, fragments of clothing, and other\r\nwaifs and strays. The _cache_ in which the retreating party had\r\ndeposited their books and instruments was also examined; but the only\r\nrelics were a brass bowl of a seven-inch compass, a tin tube, and parts\r\nof a telescope. Some cases and casks, containing records for the use\r\nof Captain Nares, were securely placed among the rocks on the western\r\npoint of the island; and Captain Young then returned to Cape Isabella.\r\n\r\nFinding nothing here of any interest, and convinced that no travelling\r\nor boat party had reached that position from the Polar ships, the\r\n_Pandora_ bore away to the northward under canvas. “It was very\r\ndark and thick,” says Captain Young, “but sufficiently clear to enable\r\nus to avoid the heavy ice. By nine A.M. we were up to Lecomte\r\nIsland, when we were stopped by a fog until eleven o’clock, when I\r\ncould see from aloft that the main pack extended across the straits\r\ninto Rosse Bay. We were in a lake of land water, with close-packed and\r\nheavy ice all round, from south to north, and again closing on the\r\nland from the eastward. Our only chance of moving seemed to be through\r\na narrow lead or slack place, running first to the east-north-east,\r\nand then again apparently towards the east coast. We entered the pack,\r\nand succeeded by five P.M. in again escaping into the land\r\nwater in Hartstene Bay.” Such are the experiences of twelve hours\r\nin the ice-clogged waters of the North! But we need not delay the\r\nreader with these minute particulars, notwithstanding their interest\r\nas illustrative of the nature of the struggle waged with so much\r\npersistency of purpose by the Arctic explorer. The sea was now covered\r\neverywhere with ice and bergs. Storms were of frequent occurrence; and\r\nthe wind and wave beaten _Pandora_ was forced back into Baffin Bay.\r\n\r\nHere, on the 28th of August, her captain could see that the solid ice\r\nhad filled the straits and the head of the bay right across to Cape\r\nAlexander. The way north being thus obstructed, Captain Young resolved\r\non proceeding towards Upernavik, in North Greenland, hoping to find\r\nthat the last ship had not already sailed for Denmark, and in that\r\ncase to send an officer home with despatches, while the _Pandora_\r\nreturned to Smith Strait.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th she was off Hakluyt Island, and steered for Bardin Bay in\r\nWhale Sound. On entering the bay, a summer tent could be seen, and some\r\nEskimos, with their dogs, running to and fro, evidently with the view\r\nof attracting the attention of the visitors. Captain Young accordingly\r\nlanded, with some of his officers, and accompanied by Christian, his\r\nEskimo interpreter. The natives met them with the utmost confidence\r\nand fearlessness, assisting to haul their boat up on the shore. They\r\nwere ten in number, and all members of one family. Food appeared to be\r\nplentiful with them, but they were profuse in their thanks for some\r\nwalrus-flesh given by Captain Young. Their manners were frank and\r\ncommunicative, and they showed considerable vivacity, rejoicing over\r\nthe results of a very good hunting season. Neither European ships nor\r\nwhite men had they seen for years; but they said that an old man, who,\r\nwith his family, inhabited Northumberland Island, told of two ships\r\nwhich had passed to the northward “last summer.” How lonely must be the\r\nlife led by these poor savages! Never gladdened by the sight of a sail;\r\nbut, year after year, shut up in their frozen solitudes, and without\r\nany other object or purpose before them than to obtain just enough food\r\nto avoid a premature and miserable death!\r\n\r\nAmong their treasures Captain Young observed a ship’s bucket, half\r\nthe top of a mahogany table, the paddle of a Greenlander’s kayack,\r\nmuch ice-worn, and a piece of packing-case marked “Lime juice--Leith;”\r\nall of which, they said, had drifted into the bay at different times\r\nfrom the southward. These people seemed to Captain Young of a kind\r\nand simple disposition, while they were evidently robust and healthy.\r\nAll that they had--and it was little enough--they freely pressed upon\r\ntheir visitor; and when asked what present they would like, their chief\r\nselected only some gimlets and a fifteen-foot ash oar. The latter, he\r\nsaid, would split up into spear-shafts; the former he wanted for boring\r\nbone and ivory. Captain Young, however, gave them several other useful\r\narticles; accepting in return some narwhal horns, specimens of their\r\npot-stone cooking-kettles, and of the iron pyrites which they used for\r\nstriking fire. An exchange of dogs also took place; five of the dogs\r\nbelonging to the _Pandora_ being given for three of the finest\r\nbear-hunting and tame dogs of the Eskimos.\r\n\r\nAt Upernavik, the _Pandora_, after a stormy and dangerous passage,\r\narrived on the evening of September the 7th, but found that the last\r\nship had sailed for Europe. As there were no means, therefore, of\r\ncommunicating with England, and as, without such communication, Captain\r\nYoung did not feel authorized to winter in the North, a supply of fresh\r\nwater wars taken on board, and the ship steered for home. From the 15th\r\nto the 21st she tarried at Goodhav’n, in Disco Island. In Davis Strait\r\nshe encountered large quantities of heavy Spitzbergen drift-ice, and\r\nweathered a severe south-easterly gale. On the 16th of October, in\r\nlat. 54° 38’ N., and long. 44° 30’ W., she sighted the Arctic ships,\r\n_Alert_ and _Discovery_, and hastened to communicate with\r\nthem. They kept together until the 19th. On the following day, the\r\n_Pandora_ was buffeted by another hurricane; but the rest of her\r\nvoyage was accomplished in safety, and was marked by no incidents of\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, for the present, terminates the record of British enterprise and\r\nadventure in the Arctic World. It is difficult to believe, however,\r\nthat the nation will rest until the “heart of the mystery has been\r\nplucked out,” the Secret finally mastered, and the British flag hoisted\r\non that remote point which is conventionally known as the NORTH\r\nPOLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Agaricus muscarius, 139.\r\n\r\n    Agassiz, experiments of,
