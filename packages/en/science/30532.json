Diffin_\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n_There Comes a New World_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Behind them a red ship was falling--falling free!_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mysterious, dark, out of the unknown deep comes a new\r\nsatellite to lure three courageous Earthlings on to strange\r\nadventures.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe one hundred and fifty-ninth floor of the great Transportation\r\nBuilding allowed one standing at a window to look down upon the roofs\r\nof the countless buildings that were New York.\r\n\r\nFlat-decked, all of them; busy places of hangars and machine shops and\r\nstrange aircraft, large and small, that rose vertically under the lift\r\nof flashing helicopters.\r\n\r\nThe air was alive and vibrant with directed streams of stubby-winged\r\nshapes that drove swiftly on their way, with only a wisp of vapor from\r\ntheir funnel-shaped sterns to mark the continuous explosion that\r\npropelled them. Here and there were those that entered a shaft of\r\npale-blue light that somehow outshone the sun. It marked an ascending\r\narea, and there ships canted swiftly, swung their blunt noses upward,\r\nand vanished, to the upper levels.\r\n\r\nA mile and more away, in a great shaft of green light from which all\r\nother craft kept clear, a tremendous shape was dropping. Her hull of\r\nsilver was striped with a broad red band; her multiple helicopters\r\nwere dazzling flashes in the sunlight. The countless dots that were\r\nportholes and the larger observation ports must have held numberless\r\neager faces, for the Oriental Express served a cosmopolitan passenger\r\nlist.\r\n\r\nBut Walter Harkness, standing at the window, stared out from troubled,\r\nfrowning eyes that saw nothing of the kaleidoscopic scene. His back\r\nwas turned to the group of people in the room, and he had no thought\r\nof wonders that were prosaic, nor of passengers, eager or blase; his\r\nthoughts were only of freight and of the acres of flat roofs far in\r\nthe distance where alternate flashes of color marked the descending\r\narea for fast freighters of the air. And in his mind he could see what\r\nhis eyes could not discern--the markings on those roofs that were\r\nenormous landing fields: Harkness Terminals, New York.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOnly twenty-four, Walt Harkness--owner now of Harkness, Incorporated.\r\nDark hair that curled slightly as it left his forehead; eyes that were\r\ntaking on the intent, straightforward look that had been his father's\r\nand that went straight to the heart of a business proposal with\r\ndisconcerting directness. But the lips were not set in the hard lines\r\nthat had marked Harkness Senior; they could still curve into boyish\r\npleasure to mark the enthusiasm that was his.\r\n\r\nHe was not typically the man of business in his dress. His broad\r\nshoulders seemed slender in the loose blouse of blue silk; a narrow\r\nscarf of brilliant color was loosely tied; the close, full-length\r\ncream-colored trousers were supported by a belt of woven metal, while\r\nhis shoes were of the coarse-mesh fabric that the latest mode\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\nHe turned now at the sound of Warrington's voice. E. B. Warrington,\r\nCounsellor at Law, was the name that glowed softly on the door of\r\nthis spacious office, and Warrington's gray head was nodding as he\r\ndated and indexed a document.\r\n\r\n\"June twentieth, nineteen seventy-three,\" he repeated; \"a lucky day\r\nfor you, Walter. Inside of ten years this land will be worth double\r\nthe fifty million you are paying--and it is worth more than that to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned and handed a document to a heavy-bodied man across from him.\r\n\"Here is your copy, Herr Schwartzmann,\" he said. The man pocketed the\r\npaper with a smile of satisfaction thinly concealed on his dark face.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHarkness did not reply. He found little pleasure in the look on\r\nSchwartzmann's face, and his glance passed on to a fourth man who sat\r\nquietly at one side of the room.\r\n\r\nYoung, his tanned face made bronze by contrast with his close-curling\r\nblond hair, there was no need of the emblem on his blouse to mark him\r\nas of the flying service. Beside the spread wings was the triple star\r\nof a master pilot of the world; it carried Chet Bullard past all\r\nearth's air patrols and gave him the freedom of every level.\r\n\r\nBeside him a girl was seated. She rose quickly now and came toward\r\nHarkness with outstretched hand. And Harkness found time in the\r\ninstant of her coming to admire her grace of movement, and the\r\ncarriage that was almost stately.\r\n\r\nThe mannish attire of a woman of business seemed almost a discordant\r\nnote; he did not realize that the hard simplicity of her costume had\r\nbeen saved by the soft warmth of its color, and by an indefinable,\r\nflowing line in the jacket above the rippling folds of an undergarment\r\nthat gathered smoothly at her knees. He knew only that she made a\r\nlovely picture, surprisingly appealing, and that her smile was a\r\ncompensation for the less pleasing visage of her companion,\r\nSchwartzmann.\r\n\r\n\"Mademoiselle Vernier,\" Herr Schwartzmann had introduced her when they\r\ncame. And he had used her given name as he added: \"Mademoiselle Diane\r\nis somewhat interested in our projects.\"\r\n\r\nShe was echoing Warrington's words as she took Harkness' hand in a\r\nfriendly grasp. \"I hope, indeed, that it is the lucky day for you,\r\nMonsieur. Our modern transportation--it is so marvelous, and I know so\r\nlittle of it. But I am learning. I shall think of you as developing\r\nyour so-splendid properties wonderfully.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOnly when she and Schwartzmann were gone did Harkness answer his\r\ncounsellor's remark. The steady Harkness eyes were again wrinkled\r\nabout with puckering lines; the shoulders seemed not so square as\r\nusual.\r\n\r\n\"Lucky?\" he said. \"I hope you're right. You were Father's attorney for\r\ntwenty years--your judgment ought to be good; and mine is not entirely\r\nworthless.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is a good deal we have made--of course it is!--it bears every\r\nanalysis. We need that land if we are to expand as we must, and the\r\nbanks will carry me for the twenty million I can't swing. But,\r\nconfound it, Warrington, I've had a hunch--and I've gone against it.\r\nSchwartzmann has tied me up for ready cash, and he represents the\r\nbiggest competitors we have. They're planning something--but we need\r\nthe land.... Oh, well, I've signed up; the property is mine; but....\"\r\n\r\nThe counsellor laughed. \"You need a change,\" he said; \"I never knew\r\nyou to worry before. Why don't you jump on the China Mail this\r\nafternoon; it connects with a good line out of Shanghai. You can be\r\ntramping around the Himalayas to-morrow. A day or two there will fix\r\nyou up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too busy,\" said Harkness. \"Our experimental ship is about ready, so\r\nI'll go and play with that. We'll be shooting at the moon one of these\r\ndays.\"\r\n\r\n\"The moon!\" the other snorted. \"Crazy dreams! McInness tried it, and\r\nyou know what happened. He came back out of control--couldn't check\r\nhis speed against the repelling area--shot through and stripped his\r\nhelicopters off against the heavy air. And that other fellow,\r\nHaldgren--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Harkness quietly, \"Haldgren--he didn't fall back. He went\r\non into space.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Impossible!\" the counsellor objected. \"He must have fallen unobserved.\r\nNo, no, Walter; be reasonable. I do not claim to know much about those\r\nthings--I leave them to the Stratosphere Control Board--but I do know this\r\nmuch: that the lifting effect above the repelling area--what used to be\r\nknown as the heaviside layer--counteracts gravity's pull. That's why our\r\nships fly as they please when they have shot themselves through. But they\r\nhave to fly close to it; its force is dissipated in another ten thousand\r\nfeet, and the old earth's pull is still at work. It can't be done, my boy;\r\nthe vast reaches of space--\"\r\n\r\n\"Are the next to be conquered,\" Harkness broke in. \"And Chet and I\r\nintend to be in on it.\" He glanced toward the young flyer, and they\r\nexchanged a quiet smile.\r\n\r\n\"Remember how my father was laughed at when he dared to vision the\r\ncommerce of to-day? Crazy dreams, Warrington? That's what they said\r\nwhen Dad built the first unit of our plant, the landing stages for the\r\nbig freighters, the docks for ocean ships while they lasted, the\r\nberths for the big submarines that he knew were coming. They jeered at\r\nhim then. 'Harkness' Folly,' the first plant was called. And\r\nnow--well you know what we are doing.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed softly. \"Leave us our crazy dreams, Warrington,\" he\r\nprotested; \"sometimes those dreams come true.... And I'll try to\r\nforget my hunch. We've bought the property; now we'll make it earn\r\nmoney for us. I'll forget it now, and work on my new ship. Chet and I\r\nare about ready for a try-out.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe flyer had risen to join him, and the two turned together to the\r\ndoor where a private lift gave access to the roof. They were halfway\r\nto it when the first shock came to throw the two men on the floor.\r\n\r\nThe great framework of the Transportation Building was swaying wildly\r\nas they fell, and the groaning of its wrenched and straining members\r\nsounded through the echoing din as every movable object in the room\r\ncame crashing down.\r\n\r\nDazed for the moment, Harkness lay prone, while his eyes saw the\r\nnitron illuminator, like a great chandelier, swing widely from the\r\nceiling where it was placed. Its crushing weight started toward him,\r\nbut a last swing shot it past to the desk of the counsellor.\r\n\r\nHarkness got slowly to his feet. The flyer, too, was able to stand,\r\nthough he felt tenderly of a bruised shoulder. But where Warrington\r\nhad been was only the crumpled wreckage of a steeloid desk, the\r\nshattered bulk of the illuminator upon it, and, beneath, the mangled\r\nremains where flowing blood made a quick pool upon the polished floor.\r\n\r\nWarrington was dead--no help could be rendered there--and Harkness was\r\nreaching for the door. The shock had passed, and the building was\r\nquiet, but he shouted to the flyer and sprang into the lift.\r\n\r\n\"The air is the place for us,\" he said; \"there may be more coming.\" He\r\njammed over the control lever, and the little lift moved.\r\n\r\n\"What was it?\" gasped Bullard, \"earthquake?--explosion? Lord, what a\r\nsmash!\"\r\n\r\nHarkness made no reply. He was stepping out upon the broad surface of\r\nthe Transportation Building. He paid no attention to the hurrying\r\nfigures about him, nor did he hear the loud shouting of the\r\nnewscasting cone that was already bringing reports of the disaster. He\r\nhad thought only for the speedy little ship that he used for his daily\r\ntravel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe golden cylinder was still safe in the grip of its hold-down\r\nclutch, and its stubby wings and gleaming sextuple-bladed helicopter\r\nwere intact. Harkness sprang for the control-board.\r\n\r\nHe, too, wore an emblem: a silver circle that marked him a pilot of\r\nthe second class; he could take his ship around the world below the\r\nforty level, though at forty thousand and above he must give over\r\ncontrol to the younger man.\r\n\r\nThe hiss of the releasing clutch came softly to him as the free-signal\r\nflashed, and he sank back with a great sigh of relief as the motors\r\nhummed and the blades above leaped into action. Then the stern blast\r\nroared, though its sound came faintly through the deadened walls, and\r\nhe sent the little speedster for the pale blue light of an ascending\r\narea. Nor did he level off until the gauge before him said twenty\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\nHis first thought had been for their own safety in the air, but with\r\nit was a frantic desire to reach the great plant of the Harkness\r\nTerminals. What had happened there? Had there been any damage? Had\r\nthey felt the shock? A few seconds in level twenty would tell him. He\r\nreached the place of alternate flashes where he could descend, and the\r\nlittle ship fell smoothly down.\r\n\r\nBelow him the great expanse of buildings took form, and they seemed\r\nsafe and intact. His intention was to land, till the slim hands of\r\nChet Bullard thrust him roughly aside and reached for the controls.\r\n\r\nIt was Bullard's right--a master pilot could take control at any\r\ntime--but Harkness stared in amazement as the other lifted the ship,\r\nthen swung it out over the expanse of ocean beyond--stared until his\r\nown eyes followed those of Chet Bullard to see the wall of water that\r\nwas sweeping toward the land.\r\n\r\nChet, he knew, had held them in a free-space level, where they could\r\nmaneuver as they pleased, but he knew, too, that the pilot's hands\r\nwere touching levers that swung them at a quite unlawful speed past\r\nother ships, and that swept them down in a great curve above the\r\nocean's broad expanse.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHarkness did not at once grasp the meaning of the thing. There was the\r\nwater, sparkling clear, and a monstrous wave that lifted itself up to\r\nmountainous heights. Behind it the ocean's blue became a sea of mud;\r\nand only when he glanced at their ground-speed detector did he sense\r\nthat the watery mountain was hurling itself upon the shore with the\r\nswiftness of a great super-liner.\r\n\r\nThere were the out-thrusting capes that made a safe harbor for the\r\ncommerce that came on and beneath the waters to the Harkness\r\nTerminals; the wave built itself up to still greater heights as it\r\ncame between them. They were riding above it by a thousand feet, and\r\nWalter Harkness, in sudden knowledge of what this meant, stared with\r\nstraining eyes at the wild thing that raced with them underneath.\r\n\r\nHe must do something--anything!--to check the monster, to flatten out\r\nthe onrushing mountain! The red bottom-plates of a submarine freighter\r\ncame rolling up behind the surge to show how futile was the might of\r\nman. And the next moment marked the impact of the wall of water upon a\r\nwidespread area of landing roofs, where giant letters stared mockingly\r\nat him to spell the words: Harkness Terminals, New York.\r\n\r\nHe saw the silent crumbling of great buildings; he glimpsed in one\r\nwild second the whirling helicopters on giant freighters that took the\r\nair too late; he saw them vanish as the sea swept in and engulfed\r\nthem. And then, after endless minutes, he knew that Chet had swung\r\nagain above the site of his plant, and he saw the stumps of steel and\r\ntwisted wreckage that remained....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe pilot hung the ship in air--a golden beetle, softly humming as it\r\nhovered above the desolate scene. Chet had switched on the steady buzz\r\nof the stationary-ship signal, and the wireless warning was swinging\r\npassing craft out and around their station. Within the quiet cabin a\r\nman stood to stare and stare, unspeaking, until his pilot laid a\r\nfriendly hand upon the broad shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"You're cleaned,\" said Chet Bullard. \"It's a washout! But you'll build\r\nit up again; they can't stop you--\"\r\n\r\nBut the steady, appraising eyes of Walter Harkness had moved on and on\r\nto a rippling stretch of water where land had been before.\r\n\r\n\"Cleaned,\" he responded tonelessly; \"and then some! And I could start\r\nagain, but--\" He paused to point to the stretch of new sea, and his\r\nlips moved that he might laugh long and harshly. \"But right there is\r\nall I own--that is, the land I bought this morning. It is gone, and I\r\nowe twenty million to the hardest-hearted bunch of creditors in the\r\nworld. That foreign crowd, who've been planning to invade our\r\nterritory here. You know what chance I'll have with them....\"\r\n\r\nThe disaster was complete, and Walter Harkness was facing it--facing\r\nit with steady gray eyes and a mind that was casting a true balance of\r\naccounts. He was through, he told himself; his other holdings would be\r\nseized to pay for this waste of water that an hour before had been dry\r\nland; they would strip him of his last dollar. His lips curved into a\r\nsardonic smile.\r\n\r\n\"June twentieth, nineteen seventy-three,\" he repeated. \"Poor old\r\nWarrington! He called this my lucky day!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe pilot had respected the other man's need of silence, but his\r\ncuriosity could not be longer restrained.\r\n\r\n\"What's back of it all?\" he demanded. \"What caused it? The shock was\r\nlike no earthquake I've ever known. And this tidal wave--\" He was\r\nreaching for a small switch. He turned a dial to the words: \"News\r\nService--General,\" and the instrument broke into hurried speech.\r\n\r\nIt told of earth shocks in many places--the whole world had felt\r\nit--some tremendous readjustment among the inner stresses of the\r\nearth--most serious on the Atlantic seaboard--the great Harkness\r\nTerminals destroyed--some older buildings in the business district\r\nshaken down--loss of life not yet computed....\r\n\r\n\"But what _did_ it?\" Chet Bullard was repeating in the cabin of their\r\nfloating ship. \"A tremendous shake-up like that!\" Harkness silenced\r\nhim with a quick gesture of his hand. Another voice had broken in to\r\nanswer the pilot's question.\r\n\r\n\"The mystery is solved,\" said the new voice. \"This is the Radio-News\r\nrepresentative speaking from Calcutta. We are in communication with\r\nthe Allied Observatories on Mount Everest. At eleven P. M., World\r\nStandard Time, Professor Boyle observed a dark body in transit across\r\nthe moon. According to Boyle, a non-luminous and non-reflecting\r\nasteroid has crashed into the earth's gravitational field. A dark moon\r\nhas joined this celestial grouping, and is now swinging in an orbit\r\nabout the earth. It is this that has disturbed the balance of internal\r\nstresses within the earth--\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"A dark moon!\" Chet Bullard broke in, but again a movement from\r\nHarkness silenced his exclamations. Whatever of dull apathy had\r\ngripped young Harkness was gone. No thought now of the devastation\r\nbelow them that spelled his financial ruin. Some greater, more\r\ngripping idea had now possessed him. The instrument was still\r\nspeaking:\r\n\r\n\"--Without light of its own, nor does it reflect the sun's light as\r\ndoes our own moon. This phenomenon, as yet, is unexplained. It is\r\nnearer than our own moon and smaller, but of tremendous density.\"\r\nHarkness nodded his head quickly at that, and his eyes were alive with\r\nan inner enthusiasm not yet expressed in words. \"It is believed that\r\nthe worst is over. More minor shocks may follow, but the cause is\r\nknown; the mystery is solved. Out from the velvet dark of space has\r\ncome a small, new world to join us--\"\r\n\r\nThe voice ceased. Walter Harkness had opened the switch.\r\n\r\n\"The mystery is solved,\" Chet Bullard repeated.\r\n\r\n\"Solved?\" exclaimed the other from his place at the controls. \"Man, it\r\nis only begun!\" He depressed a lever, and a muffled roar marked their\r\npassage to a distant shaft of blue, where he turned the ship on end\r\nand shot like a giant shell for the higher air.\r\n\r\nThere was northbound travel at thirty-five, and northward Harkness\r\nwould go, but he shot straight up. At forty thousand he motioned the\r\nmaster-pilot to take over the helm.\r\n\r\n\"Clear through,\" he ordered; \"up into the liner lanes; then north for\r\nour own shop.\" Nor did he satisfy the curiosity in Chet Bullard's eyes\r\nby so much as a word until some hours later when they floated down.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn icy waste was beneath them, where the sub-polar regions were\r\nwrapped in the mantle of their endless winter. Here ships never\r\npassed. Northward, toward the Pole, were liner lanes in the higher\r\nlevels, but here was a deserted sector. And here Walter Harkness had\r\nelected to carry on his experiments.\r\n\r\nA rise of land showed gaunt and black, and the pilot was guiding the\r\nship in a long slant upon it. He landed softly beside a building in a\r\nsheltered, snow-filled valley.\r\n\r\nHarkness shivered as he stepped from the warmth of their insulated\r\ncabin, and he fumbled with shaking fingers to touch the combination\r\nupon the locked door. It swung open, to close behind the men as they\r\nstood in the warm, brightly-lighted room.\r\n\r\nNitro illuminators were hung from the ceiling, their diffused\r\nbrilliance shining down to reflect in sparkling curves and ribbons of\r\nlight from a silvery shape. It stood upon the floor, a metal cylinder\r\na hundred feet in length, whose blunt ends showed dark openings of\r\ngaping ports. There were other open ports above and below and in\r\nregular spacing about the rounded sides. No helicopters swung their\r\nblades above; there were only the bulge of a conning tower and the\r\nheavy inset glasses of the lookouts. Nor were there wings of any kind.\r\nIt might have been a projectile for some mammoth gun.\r\n\r\nHarkness stood in silence before it, until he turned to smile at the\r\nstill-wondering pilot.\r\n\r\n\"Chet,\" he said, \"it's about finished and ready--just in time. We've\r\nbuilt it, you and I; freighted in the parts ourselves and assembled\r\nevery piece. We've even built the shop: lucky the big steeloid plates\r\nare so easily handled. And you and I are the only ones that know.\r\n\r\n\"Every ship in the airlanes of the world is driven by detonite--and we\r\nhave evolved a super-detonite. We have proved that it will work. It\r\nwill carry us beyond the pull of gravitation; it will give us the\r\nfreedom of outer space. It is ours and ours alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" the other corrected slowly, \"it is yours. You have paid the\r\nbills and you have paid me. Paid me well.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm paying no more,\" Harkness told him. \"I'm broke, right this\r\nminute. I haven't a dollar--and yet I say now that poor Warrington was\r\nright: this is my lucky day.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe laughed aloud at the bewilderment on the pilot's face.\r\n\r\n\"Chet,\" he said slowly, and his voice was pitched to a more serious\r\ntone, \"out there is a new world, the Dark Moon. 'Tremendous density,'\r\nthey said. That means it can hold an atmosphere of its own. It means\r\nnew metals, new wealth. It means a new little world to explore, and\r\nit's out there waiting for us. Waiting for us; we will be the first.\r\nFor here is the ship that will take us.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't mine, Chet; it's ours. And the adventure is ours; yours and\r\nmine, both. We only meant to go a few hundred miles at first, but\r\nhere's something big. We may never come back--it's a long chance that\r\nwe're taking--but you're in on it, if you want to go....\"\r\n\r\nHe paused. The expression in the eyes of Chet Bullard, master-pilot of\r\nthe world, was answer enough. But Chet amplified it with explosive\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\"Am I in on it?\" he demanded. \"Try to count me out--just try to do it!\r\nI was game for a trial flight out beyond. And now, with a real\r\nobjective to shoot at--a new world--\"\r\n\r\nHis words failed him. Walt Harkness knew that the hand the other\r\nextended was thrust forth blindly; he gripped at it hard, while he\r\nturned to look at the shining ship.\r\n\r\nBut his inner gaze passed far beyond the gleaming thing of metal, off\r\ninto a realm of perpetual night. Out there a new world was waiting--a\r\nDark Moon!--and there they might find.... But his imagination failed\r\nhim there; he could only thrill with the adventure that the unknown\r\nheld.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n_Escape_\r\n\r\nTwo days, while a cold sun peeped above an icy horizon! Two days of\r\ndriving, eager work on the installation of massive motors--yet motors\r\nso light that one man could lift them--then Harkness prepared to\r\nleave.\r\n\r\n\"Wealth brings care when it comes,\" he told Chet, \"but it leaves\r\nplenty of trouble behind it when it goes. I must get back to New York\r\nand throw what is left of my holdings to the wolves; they must be\r\nhowling by this time to find out where I am. I'll drop back here in a\r\nweek.\"\r\n\r\nThere were instruments to be installed, and Chet would look after\r\nthat. He would test the motors where the continuous explosion of\r\nsuper-detonite would furnish the terrific force for their driving\r\npower. Then the exhaust from each port must be measured and thrusts\r\nequalized, where needed, by adjustment of great valves. All this Chet\r\nwould finish. And then--a test flight. Harkness hoped to be back for\r\nthe first try-out of the new ship.\r\n\r\n\"I'll be seeing you in a week,\" he repeated. \"You'll be that long\r\ngetting her tuned up.\"\r\n\r\nBut Chet Bullard grinned derisively. \"Two days!\" he replied. \"You'll\r\nhave to step some if you get in on the trial flight. But don't worry;\r\nI won't take off for the Dark Moon. I'll just go up and play around\r\nabove the liner lanes and see how the old girl stunts.\"\r\n\r\nHarkness nodded. \"Watch for patrol ships,\" he warned. \"There's no\r\ntraffic directly over here--that's one reason why I chose this\r\nspot--but don't let anyone get too close. Our patents have not been\r\napplied for.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHarkness spent a day in New York. Then a night trip by Highline\r\nExpress took him to London where he busied himself for some hours.\r\nNext, a fast passenger plane for Vienna.\r\n\r\nIn other days Walter Harkness would have chartered a private ship to\r\ncut off a few precious hours, but he was traveling more economically\r\nnow. And the representatives of his foreign competitors were not now\r\ncoming to see him; he must go to them.\r\n\r\nAt the great terminal in Vienna a man approached him. \"Herr Harkness?\"\r\nhe inquired, and saluted stiffly.\r\n\r\nHe was not in uniform. He was not of the Allied Patrol nor of any\r\nbranch of the police force that encircled the world in its operations.\r\nYet his military bearing was unmistakable. To Harkness it was\r\nreminiscent of old pictures of Prussian days--those curious pictures\r\nrevived at times for the amusement of those who turned to their\r\ntelevision sets for entertainment. He had to repress a smile as he\r\nfollowed where the other led him to a gray speedster in a distant\r\ncorner of the open concourse.\r\n\r\nHe stepped within a luxurious cabin and would have gone on into the\r\nlittle control room, but his guide checked him. Harkness was mildly\r\ncurious as to their course--Schwartzmann was to have seen him in\r\nVienna--but the way to the instrument board was barred. Another\r\nprecise salute, and he was motioned to the cabin at the rear.\r\n\r\n\"It is orders that I follow,\" he was told. And Walter Harkness\r\ncomplied.\r\n\r\n\"It could happen only here,\" he told himself. And he found himself\r\nexasperated by a people who were slow to conform to the customs of a\r\nworld whose closely-knit commerce had obliterated the narrow\r\nnationalism of the past.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey landed in an open court surrounded by wide lawns. He glimpsed\r\ntrees about them in the dusk, and looming before him was an old-time\r\nbuilding of the chateau type set off in this private park. He would\r\nhave followed his guide toward the entrance, but a flash of color\r\nchecked him.\r\n\r\nLike a streak of flame a ship shot in above them; hung poised near the\r\none that had brought them and settled to rest beside it. A little red\r\nspeedster, it made a splash of crimson against the green lawns beyond.\r\nAnd, \"Nice flying,\" Harkness was telling himself.\r\n\r\nThe hold-down clamps had hardly gripped it when a figure sprang out\r\nfrom an opened door. A figure in cool gray that took warmth and color\r\nfrom the ship behind--a figure of a girl, tall and slender and\r\ngraceful as she came impulsively toward him.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Harkness!\" she exclaimed. \"But this is a surprise. I thought\r\nthat Herr Schwartzmann was to see you in Vienna!\" For a brief moment\r\nHarkness saw a flicker of puzzled wonderment in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"And I am sorry,\" she went on, \"--so very sorry for your misfortune.\r\nBut we will be generous.\"\r\n\r\nShe withdrew her hand which Harkness was holding. He was still\r\nphrasing a conventional greeting as she flung him a gay laugh and a\r\nlook from brown eyes that smiled encouragement. She was gone before\r\nhe found words for reply.\r\n\r\nWalter Harkness had been brought up in a world of business, and knew\r\nlittle of the subtle message of a woman's eyes. But he felt within him\r\na warm response to the friendly companionship that the glance implied.\r\n\r\nWithin the chateau, in a dark-paneled room, Herr Schwartzmann was\r\nwaiting. He motioned Harkness to a chair and resumed his complacent\r\ncontemplation of a picture that was flowing across a screen. Color\r\nphotography gave every changing shade. It was coming by wireless, as\r\nHarkness knew, and he realized that the sending instrument must be in\r\na ship that cruised slowly above a scene of wreckage and desolation.\r\n\r\nHe recognized the ruins of his great plant; he saw the tiny figures of\r\nmen, and he knew that the salvage company he had placed in charge was\r\non the job. Beyond was a stretch of rippling water where the great\r\nwave had boiled over miles of land and had sucked it back to the\r\nocean's depths. And he realized that the beginning of his conference\r\nwas not auspicious.\r\n\r\nAfter the warmth of the girl's greeting, this other was like a plunge\r\ninto the Arctic chill of his northern retreat.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I have listed every dollar's worth of property that I own,\" he was\r\nsaying an hour later, \"and I have turned it over to a trustee who will\r\nprotect your rights. What more do you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have heard of some experimental work,\" said Herr Schwartzmann\r\nsmoothly. \"A new ship; some radical changes in design. We would like\r\nthat also.\"\r\n\r\n\"Try and get it,\" Harkness invited.\r\n\r\nThe other passed that challenge by. \"There is another alternative,\"\r\nhe said. \"My principals in France are unknown to you; perhaps, also,\r\nit is not known that they intend to extend their lines to New York and\r\nthat they will erect great terminals to do the work that you have\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\"Your father was the pioneer; there is great value in the name of\r\nHarkness--the 'good-will' as you say in America. We would like to\r\nadopt that name, and carry on where you have left off. If you were to\r\nassign to us the worthless remains of your plant, and all right and\r\ntitle to the name of Harkness Terminals, it might be--\" He paused\r\ndeliberately while Harkness stiffened in his chair. \"It might be that\r\nwe would require no further settlement. The balance of your\r\nfortune--and your ship--will be yours.\"\r\n\r\nHarkness' gray eyes, for a moment, betrayed the smouldering rage that\r\nwas his.\r\n\r\n\"Put it in plain words,\" he demanded. \"You would bribe me to sell you\r\nsomething you cannot create for yourselves. The name of Harkness has\r\nstood for fair-dealing, for honor, for scrupulous observance of our\r\nclients' rights. My father established it on that basis and I have\r\ncontinued in the same way. And you?--well, it occurs to me that the\r\nSchwartzmann interests have had a different reputation. Now you would\r\nbuy my father's name to use it as a cloak for your dirty work!\"\r\n\r\nHe rose abruptly. \"It is not for sale. Every dollar that I own will be\r\nused to settle my debt. There will be enough--\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHerr Schwartzmann refused to be insulted. His voice was unruffled as\r\nhe interrupted young Harkness' vehement statement.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you are right; perhaps not. Permit me to remind you that the\r\nvalue of your holdings may depreciate under certain influences that\r\nwe are able to exert--also that you are in Austria, and that the laws\r\nof this country permit us to hold you imprisoned until the debt is\r\npaid. In the meantime we will find your ship and seize it, and\r\nwhatever it has of value will be protected by patents in our name.\"\r\n\r\nHis unctuous voice became harsh. \"Honor! Fair dealing!\" He spat out\r\nthe words in sudden hate. \"You Americans who will not realize that\r\nbusiness is business!\"\r\n\r\nHarkness was standing, drawn unconsciously to his full height. He\r\nlooked down upon the other man. All anger had gone from his face; he\r\nseemed only appraising the individual before him.\r\n\r\n\"The trouble with you people,\" he said, \"is that you are living in the\r\npast--way back about nineteen fourteen, when might made\r\nright--sometimes.\"\r\n\r\nHe continued to look squarely into the other's eyes, but his lips set\r\nfirmly, and his voice was hard and decisive.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" he continued, \"I am not here to educate you, nor to deal with\r\nyou. Any further negotiations will be through my counsellors. And now\r\nI will trouble you to return me to the city. We are through with\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHerr Schwartzmann's heavy face drew into lines of sardonic humor. \"Not\r\nquite through,\" he said; \"and you are not returning to the city.\" He\r\ndrew a paper from his desk.\r\n\r\n\"I anticipated some such _verdammpt_ foolishness from you. You see\r\nthis? It is a contract; a release, a transfer of all your interests in\r\nHarkness, Incorporated. It needs only your signature, and that will be\r\nsupplied. No one will question it when we are done: the very ink in\r\nthe stylus you carry will be duplicated. For the last time, I repeat\r\nmy offer; I am patient with you. Sign this, and keep all else that\r\nyou have. Refuse, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" Harkness inquired.\r\n\r\n\"And we will sign for you--a forgery that will never be detected. And\r\nas for you, your body will be found--a suicide! You will leave a\r\nletter: we will attend to all that. Herr Harkness will have found this\r\nmisfortune unbearable.... We shall be very sad!\" His heavy smile grew\r\ninto derisive laughter.\r\n\r\n\"I am still patient, and kind,\" he added. \"I give you twenty-four\r\nhours to think it over.\"\r\n\r\nA touch of a button on his desk summoned the man who had brought\r\nHarkness there. \"Herr Harkness is in your charge,\" were the\r\ninstructions to the one who stood stiffly at attention. \"He is not to\r\nleave this place. Is it understood?\"\r\n\r\nAs he was ushered from the room, Walter Harkness also understood, and\r\nhe knew that this was no idle threat. He had heard ugly rumors of Herr\r\nSchwartzmann and his methods. One man, he knew, had dared to oppose\r\nhim--and that man had gone suddenly insane. A touch of a needle, it\r\nwas whispered....\r\n\r\nThere had been other rumors; Schwartzmann got what he wanted; his\r\nfinancial backing was enormous. And now he would bring his ruthless\r\nmethods to America. But there he needed the Harkness standing, the\r\nreputation for probity--and Walter Harkness was grimly resolved that\r\nthey should never buy it from him. But the problem must be faced, and\r\nthe answer found, if answer there was, in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn amazing state of affairs in a modern world! He stood meditating\r\nupon his situation in a great, high-ceilinged room. A bed stood in a\r\ncorner, and other furniture marked the room as belonging to an earlier\r\ntime. Even mechanical weather-control was wanting; one must open the\r\nwindows, Harkness found, to get cooling air.\r\n\r\nHe stood at the open window and saw storm clouds blowing up swiftly. They\r\nblotted the stars from the night sky; they swept black and ominous\r\noverhead, and seemed to touch the giant trees that whipped their branches\r\nin the wind. But he was thinking not at all of the storm, and only of the\r\nfact that this room where he stood must be directly above the one where\r\nSchwartzmann was seated. Schwartzmann--who would put an end to his life as\r\ncasually as he would bring down a squirrel from one of those trees!\r\n\r\nAnd again he thought: \"Twenty-four hours!... Why hours? Why not\r\nminutes?... Whatever must be done he must do now. And might made\r\nright: it was the only way to meet this unscrupulous foreign\r\nscoundrel.\"\r\n\r\nA wind-tossed branch lashed at him. On the ground below he saw the man\r\nwho had brought him, posting another as a guard. They glanced up at\r\nhis window. There would be no escape there.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the branch seemed beckoning. He caught it when again it\r\nwhipped toward him, and, without any definite plan, he lashed it fast\r\nwith a velvet cord from the window drapes.\r\n\r\nBut his thoughts came back to the room. He snatched suddenly at the\r\ncovers of the bed. What were the sheets?--fabric as old-fashioned as\r\nthe room, or were they cellulex? The touch of the soft fabric\r\nreassured him: it was as soft as though woven of spider's web, and\r\nstrong as fibres of steel.\r\n\r\nIt took all of his strength to rip it into strips, but it was a matter\r\nof minutes, only, until he had a rope that would bear his weight. The\r\nstorm had broken; the black clouds let loose a deluge of water that\r\ndrove in at the window. If only the window below was still open!\r\n\r\nHe found the middle of his rope, looped it over a post of the bed,\r\nand, with both strands in his grasp, let himself out and over the\r\ndripping sill.\r\n\r\nWould the guard see him, or had he taken to shelter? Harkness did not\r\npause to look. He left the branch tied fast. \"A squirrel in a tree,\"\r\nhe thought: the branch would mislead them. His feet found the\r\nwindow-sill one story below. He drew himself into the room and let\r\nloose of one strand of his rope as he entered.\r\n\r\nSchwartzmann was gone. Harkness, with the bundle of wet fabric in his\r\nhands, glanced quickly about. A door stood open--it was a closet--and\r\nthe rain-drenched man was hidden there an instant later. But he\r\nstepped most carefully across the floor and touched his wet shoes only\r\nto the rugs where their print was lost. And he held himself\r\nbreathlessly silent as he heard the volley of gutteral curses that\r\nmarked the return of Herr Schwartzmann some minutes later.\r\n\r\n\"Imbecile!\" Schwartzmann shouted above the crash of the closing\r\nwindow. \"_Dumkopff!_ You have let him escape.\r\n\r\n\"Give me your pistol!\" Harkness glimpsed the figure of his recent\r\nguard. \"Get another for yourself--find him!--shoot him down! A little\r\nlead and detonite will end this foolishness!\"\r\n\r\nFrom his hiding place Harkness saw the bulky figure of Schwartzmann,\r\nwho made as if to follow where the other man had gone. The pistol was\r\nin his hand. Walt Harkness knew all too well what that meant. The tiny\r\ngrain of detonite in the end of each leaden ball was the same terrible\r\nexplosive that drove their ships: it would tear him to pieces. And he\r\nhad to get this man.\r\n\r\nHe was tensed for a spring as Schwartzmann paused. From the wall\r\nbeyond him a red light was flashing; a crystal flamed forth with the\r\nintense glare of a thousand fires. It checked the curses on the\r\nother's thick lips; it froze Harkness to a rigid statue in the\r\ndarkness of his little room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn emergency flash broadcast over the world! It meant that the News\r\nService had been commandeered. This flashing signal was calling to the\r\npeoples of the earth!\r\n\r\nWhat catastrophe did this herald? Had it to do with the Dark Moon? Not\r\nsince the uprising of the Mole-men, those creatures who had spewed\r\nforth from the inner world, had the fiery crystal called!... It seemed\r\nto Harkness that Schwartzmann was hours in reaching the switch.... A\r\nvoice came shouting into the room:\r\n\r\n\"By order of the Stratosphere Control Board,\" it commanded, \"all\r\ntraffic is forbidden above the forty level. Liners take warning.\r\nDescend at once.\"\r\n\r\nOver and over it repeated the command--an order whose authority could\r\nnot be disregarded. In his inner vision Harkness saw the tumult in the\r\nskies, the swift dropping of huge liners and great carriers of fast\r\nfreight, the scurrying of other craft to give clearance to these\r\nmonsters whose terrific speed must be slowly checked. But why? What\r\nhad happened? What could warrant such disruption of the traffic of the\r\nworld? His tensed muscles were aching unheeded; his sense of feeling\r\nseemed lost, so intently was he waiting for some further word.\r\n\r\n\"Emergency news report,\" said another voice, and Harkness strained\r\nevery faculty to hear. \"Highline ships attacked by unknown foe. Three\r\npassenger carriers of the Northpolar Short Line reported crashed.\r\nIncomplete warnings from their commanders indicate they were attacked.\r\nPatrol ship has spotted one crash. They have landed beside it and are\r\nreporting....\r\n\r\n\"The report is in; it is almost beyond belief. They say the liner is\r\nempty, that no human body, alive or dead, is in the ship. She was\r\nstripped of crew and passengers in the air.\r\n\r\n\"We await confirmation. Danger apparently centered over arctic\r\nregions, but traffic has been ordered from all upper levels--\"\r\n\r\nThe voice that had been held rigidly to the usual calm clarity of an\r\nofficial announcer became suddenly high-pitched and vibrant. \"Stand\r\nby!\" it shouted. \"An S. O. S. is coming in. We will put it through our\r\namplifiers; give it to you direct!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe newscaster crackled and hissed: they were waiving all technical\r\nniceties at R. N. Headquarters, Harkness knew. The next voice came\r\nclearly, though a trifle faint.\r\n\r\n\"Air Patrol! Help! Position eighty-two--fourteen north,\r\nninety-three--twenty east--Superliner Number 87-G, flying at R. A. plus\r\nseven. We are attacked!--Air Patrol!--Air Patrol!--Eighty-two--fourteen\r\nnorth, ninety-three--twenty--\"\r\n\r\nThe voice that was repeating the position was lost in a pandemonium of\r\ncries. Then--\r\n\r\n\"Monsters!\" the voice was shouting. \"They have seized the ship! They\r\nare tearing at our ports--\" A hissing crash ended in silence....\r\n\r\n\"Tearing at our ports!\" Harkness was filled with a blinding nausea as\r\nhe sensed what had come with the crash. The opening ports--the\r\nout-rush of air released to the thin atmosphere of those upper levels!\r\nEarth pressure within the cabins of the ship; then in an\r\ninstant--none! Every man, every woman and child on the giant craft,\r\nhad died instantly!\r\n\r\nThe announcer had resumed, but above the sound was a guttural voice\r\nthat shouted hoarsely in accents of dismay. \"Eighty-seven-G!\"\r\nSchwartzmann was exclaiming, \"--Mein Gott! It iss our own ship, the\r\nAlaskan! Our crack flyer!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHarkness heard him but an instant, for another thought was hammering\r\nat his brain. The position!--the ship's position!--it was almost above\r\nhis experimental plant! And Chet was there, and the ship.... What had\r\nChet said? He would fly it in two days--and this was the second day!\r\nChet had no radio-news; no instrument had been installed in the shop;\r\nthey had depended upon the one in Harkness' own ship. And now--\r\n\r\nWalt Harkness' clear understanding had brought a vision that was\r\nsickening, so plainly had he glimpsed the scene of terror in that\r\ndistant cabin. And now he saw with equal clarity another picture.\r\nThere was Chet, smiling, unafraid, proud of their joint accomplishment\r\nand of the gleaming metal shape that he was lifting carefully from its\r\nbed. He was floating it out to the open air; he was taking off, and\r\nup--up where some horror awaited.\r\n\r\n\"Monsters!\" that thin voice had cried in a tone that was vibrant with\r\nterror. What could it be?--great ships out of space?--an invasion? Or\r\nbeasts?... But Harkness' vision failed him there. He knew only that a\r\nfast ship was moored just outside. He had planned vaguely to seize it;\r\nhe had needed it for his own escape; but he needed it a thousand times\r\nmore desperately now. Chet might have been delayed, and he must warn\r\nhim.... The thoughts were flashing like hot sparks through his brain\r\nas he leaped.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe bore the heavier body of Schwartzmann to the floor. He rained\r\nsmashing blows upon him with a furious frenzy that would not be\r\ncurbed. The weapon with its deadly detonite bullet came toward him.\r\nIn the same burst of fury he tore the weapon from the hand that held\r\nit; then sprang to his feet to stand wild-eyed and panting is he aimed\r\nthe pistol at the cursing man and dragged him to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"The ship!\" he said between heavy breaths, \"--the ship! Take me to it!\r\nYou will tell anyone we meet it is all right. One word of alarm, one\r\nwrong look, and I'll blow you to hell and make a break for it!\"\r\n\r\nThe pistol under Harkness' silken jacket was pressed firmly into\r\nSchwartzmann's side; it brought them safely past excited guards and\r\nout into the storm; it held steady until the men had fought their way\r\nthrough blasts of rain to the side of the anchored ship. Not till then\r\ndid Schwartzmann speak.\r\n\r\n\"Wait,\" he said. \"Are you crazy, Harkness? You can never take off; the\r\ntrees are close; a straight ascent is needed. And the wind--!\"\r\n\r\nHe struggled in the other's grasp as Harkness swung open the cabin\r\ndoor, his fear of what seemed a certain death overmastering his fear\r\nof the weapon. He was shouting for help as Harkness threw him roughly\r\naside and leaped into the ship.\r\n\r\nOutside Harkness saw running figures as he threw on the motors. A\r\npistol's flash came sharply through the storm and dark. A window in\r\nthe chateau flashed into brilliance to frame the figure of a girl.\r\nTall and slender, she leaned forward with outstretched arms. She\r\nseemed calling to him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHarkness seized the controls, and knew as he did so that Schwartzmann\r\nwas right: he could never lift the ship in straight ascent. Before her\r\nwhirling fans could raise her they would be crashed among the trees.\r\n\r\nBut there were two helicopters--dual lift, one forward and one aft.\r\nAnd Walt Harkness, pilot of the second class, earned immediate\r\ndisbarment or a much higher rating as he coolly fingered the controls.\r\nHe cut the motor on the big fan at the stern, threw the forward one on\r\nfull and set the blades for maximum lift, then released the hold-down\r\ngrips that moored her.\r\n\r\nThe grips let go with a crashing of metal arms. The bow shot upward\r\nwhile a blast of wind tore at the stubby wings. The slim ship tried to\r\nstand erect. Another furious, beating wind lifted her bodily, as\r\nHarkness, clinging desperately within the narrow room, threw his full\r\nweight upon the lever that he held.\r\n\r\nThe full blast of a detonite motor, on even a small ship, is terrific,\r\nand the speedster of Herr Schwartzmann did not lack for power. Small\r\nwonder that the rules of the Board of Control prohibit the use of the\r\nstern blast under one thousand feet.\r\n\r\nThe roaring inferno from the stern must have torn the ground as if by\r\na mammoth plow; the figures of men must have scattered like leaves in\r\na gusty wind. The ship itself was racked and shuddering with the\r\nimpact of the battering thrust, but it rose like a rocket, though\r\ncanted on one wing, and the crashing branches of wind-torn trees\r\nmarked its passage on a long, curving slant that bent upward into the\r\ndark. Within the control room Walter Harkness grinned happily as he\r\ndrew his bruised body from the place where he had been thrown, and\r\nbrought the ship to an even keel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNice work! But there was other work ahead, and the smile of\r\nsatisfaction soon passed. He held the nose up, and the wireless\r\nwarning went out before as the wild climb kept on.\r\n\r\nForty thousand was passed; then fifty and more; a hundred thousand;\r\nand at length he was through the repelling area, that zone of\r\nmysterious force, above which was a magnetic repulsion nearly\r\nneutralizing gravity. He could fly level now; every unit of force\r\ncould be used for forward flight to hurl him onward faster and faster\r\ninto the night.\r\n\r\nHarkness was flying where his license was void; he was flying, too,\r\nwhere all aircraft were banned. But the rules of the Board of Control\r\nmeant nothing to him this night. Nor did the voluble and sulphurous\r\norders to halt that a patrol-ship flashed north. The patrol-ship was\r\non station; she was lost far astern before she could gather speed for\r\npursuit.\r\n\r\nWalter Harkness had caught his position upon a small chart. It was a\r\nsphere, and he led a thin wire from the point that was Vienna to a dot\r\nthat he marked on the sub-polar waste. He dropped a slender pointer\r\nupon the wire and engaged its grooved tip, and then the flying was out\r\nof his hands. The instrument before him, with its light bulbs and\r\nswift moving discs, would count their speed of passage; it would hold\r\nthe ship steadily upon an unerring course and allow for drift of\r\nwinds. The great-circle course was simple; the point he marked was\r\ndrawing them as if it had been a magnet--drawing them as it drew the\r\neyes of Walt Harkness, staring strainingly ahead as if to span the\r\nthousands of miles of dark.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n_The Space Terror_\r\n\r\nThe control room was glassed in on all sides. The thick triple lenses\r\nwere free from clouding, and the glasses between them kept out the\r\nbiting cold of the heights. The glass was strong, to hold the pressure\r\nof one atmosphere that was maintained within the ship. The lookouts\r\ngave free vision in all directions except directly below the hull,\r\nand a series of mirrors corrected this defect.\r\n\r\nBut Walt Harkness had eyes solely for the black void ahead. Only the\r\nbrilliant stars shone now in the mantle of velvety night. No flashing\r\nlights denoted the passing of liners, for they were safe in the harbor\r\nof the lower levels. He moved the controls once to avoid the green\r\nglare of an ascending area, then he knew that there were no ships to\r\nfear, and let the automatic control put him back on his course.\r\n\r\nBefore him, under a hooded light, was a heavy lens. It showed in\r\nmagnification a portion of the globe. There were countries and seas on\r\na vari-colored map, and one pin-point of brilliance that marked his\r\never-changing position.\r\n\r\nHe watched the slow movement of the glowing point. The Central\r\nFederated States of Europe were behind him; the point was tracing a\r\ncourse over the vast reaches of the patchwork map that meant the many\r\ndemocracies of Russia. This cruiser of Schwartzmann's was doing five\r\nhundred miles an hour--and the watching man cursed under his breath at\r\nthe slow progress of the tiny light.\r\n\r\nBut the light moved, and the slow hours passed, while Harkness tried\r\nto find consolation in surmises he told himself must be true.\r\n\r\nChet had been delayed, he insisted to himself; Chet could never have\r\nfinished the work in two days; he had been bluffing good-naturedly\r\nwhen he threatened to fly the ship alone....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Arctic Ocean was beneath. The tiny light had passed clear of the\r\nland on the moving chart.\r\n\r\nHe would be there soon.... Of course Chet had been fooling; he was\r\nalways ready for a joke.... Great fellow, Chet! They had taken their\r\ntraining together, and Chet had gone on to win a master-pilot's\r\nrating, the highest to be had....\r\n\r\nAnother hour, and a rising hum from a buzzer beside him gave warning\r\nof approach to the destination he had fixed. The automatic control was\r\nwarning him to decelerate. Harkness well knew what was expected of the\r\npilot when that humming sounded; yet, with total disregard for the\r\nsafety of his helicopters, he dived at full speed for the denser air\r\nbeneath.\r\n\r\nHe felt the weight that came suddenly upon him as he drove through and\r\nbeneath the repelling area, and he flattened out and checked his\r\nterrific speed when the gauges quivered at forty thousand.\r\n\r\nThen down and still down in a long, slanting dive, till a landmark was\r\nfound. He was off his course a bit, but it was a matter of minutes\r\nuntil he circled, checked his wild flight, and sank slowly beneath the\r\nlift of the dual fans to set the ship down as softly as a snowflake\r\nbeside a building that was dark and forbiddingly silent--a lonely\r\noutpost in a lonely waste.\r\n\r\nNo answer came to his hail. The building was empty; the ship was gone.\r\nAnd Chet! Chet Bullard!... Harkness' head was heavy on his shoulders;\r\nhis feet took him with hopeless, lagging steps to his waiting ship. He\r\nwas tired--and the long strain of the flight had been in vain. He was\r\nsuddenly certain of disaster. And Chet--Chet was up there at some\r\nhitherto untouched height, battling with--what?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe broke into a stumbling run and drew himself within the little ship.\r\nHe was helpless; the ship was unarmed, even if the weapons of his\r\nworld were of use against this unknown terror; but he knew that he was\r\ngoing up. He would find Chet if he could get within reach of his ship;\r\nhe would warn him.... He tried to tell himself that he might yet be in\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe little cruiser rose slowly under the lift of the fans; then he\r\nopened the throttle and swept out in a parabolic curve that ended in a\r\nvertical line. Straight up, the ship roared. It shot through a stratum\r\nof clouds. The sun that was under the horizon shone redly now; it grew\r\nto a fiery ball; the earth contracted; the markings that were\r\ncoastlines and mountains drew in upon themselves.\r\n\r\nHe passed the repelling area and felt the lift of its mysterious\r\nforce--the \"R. A. Effect\" that permitted the high-level flying of the\r\nworld. His speed increased. It would diminish again as the R. A.\r\nEffect grew less. Record flights had been made to another ten\r\nthousand.... He wondered what the ceiling would be for the ship\r\nbeneath him. He would soon learn....\r\n\r\nHe set his broadcast call for the number of Chet's ship. They had been\r\ngiven an experimental license, and \"E--L--29-X\" the instrument was\r\nflashing, \"E--L--29-X.\" Above the heaviside layer that had throttled\r\nthe radio of earlier years, he knew that his call from so small an\r\ninstrument as this would be carried for hundreds of miles.\r\n\r\nHe reached the limit of his climb and was suddenly weightless,\r\nfloating aimlessly within the little room; the ship was falling, and\r\nhe was falling with it. His speed of descent built up to appalling\r\nfigures until his helicopters found air to take their thrust.\r\n\r\nAnd still no answering word from Chet. The cruiser was climbing again\r\nto the heights. The hands of Harkness, trembling slightly now, held\r\nher to a vertical climb, while his eyes crept back to the unlit plate\r\nwhere Chet's answering call should flash. But his own call would be a\r\nguide to Chet; the directional finders on the new ship would trace the\r\nposition of his own craft if the new ship were afloat--if it were not\r\nlying crushed on the ice below, empty, like the liners, of any sign\r\nof life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis despairing mind snapped sharply to attention. His startled jerk\r\nthrew the ship widely from her course. A voice was speaking--Chet's\r\nvoice! It was shouting in the little room!\r\n\r\n\"Go down, Walt,\" it told him. \"For God's sake, go down! I'm right\r\nabove you; I've been fighting them for an hour; but I'll make it!\"\r\n\r\nHe heard the clash of levers thrown sharply over in that distant ship;\r\nhis own hands were frozen to the controls. His ship roared on in its\r\nupward course, the futile \"E--L--29-X\" of his broadcast call still\r\ngoing out to a man who could not remove his hands to send an answer,\r\nbut who had managed to switch on his sending set into which he could\r\nshout.\r\n\r\nHarkness was staring into the black void whence the wireless voice had\r\ncome--staring into the empty night. And then he saw them.\r\n\r\nThe thin air was crystal clear; his gaze penetrated for miles. And far\r\nup in the heights, where his own ship could never reach and where no\r\nclouds could be, were diaphanous wraiths. Like streamers of cloud in\r\nlong serpentine forms, they writhed and shot through space with\r\nlightning speed. They grew luminous as they moved living streamers of\r\nmoonlit clouds.... A whirling cluster was gathered into a falling\r\nmass. Out of it in a sharp right turn shot a projectile, tiny and\r\nglistening against the velvet black. The swarm closed in again....\r\nThere were other lashing shapes that came diving down. They were\r\ncoming toward him.\r\n\r\nAnd, in his ears, a voice was imploring: \"Down! down! The R. A.\r\ntension may stop them!... Go down! I am coming--you can't help--I'll\r\nmake it--they'll rip you to pieces--\"\r\n\r\nThe wraith-like coils that had left the mass above had straightened to\r\nsharp spear-heads of speed. They were darting upon him, swelling to\r\nmonstrous size in their descent. And Walt Harkness saw in an instant\r\nthe folly of delay: he was not helping Chet, but only hindering....\r\nHis ship swung end for end under his clutching hands, and the thrust\r\nof his stern exhaust was added to the pull of Earth to throw him into\r\na downward flight that tore even the thin air into screaming\r\nfragments.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne glance through the lookouts behind him showed lashing serpent\r\nforms, translucent as pale fire; impossible beasts from space. His\r\nreason rejected them while his eyes told him the terrible truth.\r\nDespite the speed of his dive, they were gaining on him, coming up\r\nfast; one snout that ended in a cupped depression was plain. A mouth\r\ngaped beneath it; above was a row of discs that were eyes--eyes that\r\nshone more brightly than the luminous body behind--eyes that froze the\r\nmind and muscles of the watching man in utter terror.\r\n\r\nHe forced himself to look ahead, away from the spectral shapes that\r\npursued. They were close, yet he thrilled with the realization that he\r\nhad helped Chet in some small degree: he had drawn off this group of\r\nattackers.\r\n\r\nHe felt the upthrust of the R. A. Effect; he felt, too, the pull of a\r\nbody that had coiled about his ship. No intangible, vaporous thing,\r\nthis. The glass of his control room was obscured by a clinging,\r\nglowing mass while still the little cruiser tore on.\r\n\r\nBefore his eyes the glowing windows went dark, and he felt the\r\nclutching thing stripped from the hull as the ship shot through the\r\ninvisible area of repulsion. A scant hundred yards away a huge\r\ncylinder drove crashingly past. Its metal shone and glittered in the\r\nsun; he knew it for his own ship--his and Chet's. And what was within\r\nit? What of Chet? The loudspeaker was silent.\r\n\r\nHe eased the thundering craft that bore him into a slow-forming curve\r\nthat did not end for fourscore miles before the wild flight was\r\nchecked. He swung it back, to guide the ship with shaking hands where\r\na range of mountains rose in icy blackness, and where a gleaming\r\ncylinder rested upon a bank of snow whose white expanse showed a\r\nfigure that came staggering to meet him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome experiences and dangers that come to men must be talked over at\r\nonce; thrills and excitement and narrow escapes must be told and\r\ncompared. And then, at rare times, there are other happenings that\r\nstrike too deeply for speech--terrors that rouse emotions beyond mere\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nIt was so with Harkness and Chet. A gripping of hands; a perfunctory,\r\n\"Good work, old man!\"--and that was all. They housed the two ships,\r\nclosing the great doors to keep out the arctic cold; and then Chet\r\nBullard threw himself exhausted upon a cot, while he stared, still\r\nwordless, at the high roof overhead. But his hands that gripped and\r\nstrained at whatever they touched told of the reaction to his wild\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nHarkness was examining their ship, where shreds of filmy, fibrous\r\nmaterial still clung, when Chet spoke.\r\n\r\n\"You knew they were there?\" he asked, \"--and you came up to warn me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" Harkness answered simply.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" Chet told him with equal brevity.\r\n\r\nAnother silence. Then: \"All right, tell me! What's the story?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Walt Harkness told him in brief sentences of the world-wide\r\nwarning that had flashed, of the liners crashing to earth and their\r\ncabins empty of human life.\r\n\r\n\"They could do it,\" said Chet. \"They could open the ports and ram\r\nthose snaky heads inside to feed.\" He seemed to muse for a moment upon\r\nwhat might have come to him.\r\n\r\n\"My speed saved me,\" he told Harkness. \"Man, how that ship can travel!\r\nI shook them off a hundred times--outmaneuvered them when I could--but\r\nthey came right back for more.\r\n\r\n\"How do they propel themselves?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"No one knows,\" Harkness told him. \"That luminosity in action means\r\nsomething--some conversion of energy, electrical, perhaps, to carry\r\nthem on lines of force of which we know nothing as yet. That's a\r\nguess--but they do it. You and I can swear to that.\"\r\n\r\nChet was pondering deeply. \"High-level lanes are closed,\" he said,\r\n\"and we are blockaded like the rest of the world. It looks as if our\r\nspace flights were off. And the Dark Moon trip! We could have made it,\r\ntoo.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf there was a questioning note in those last remarks it was answered\r\npromptly.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" said Harkness with explosive emphasis. \"They won't stop me.\" He\r\nstruck one clenched fist upon the gleaming hull beside him.\r\n\r\n\"This is all I've got. And I won't have this if that gang of\r\nSchwartzmann's gets its hands upon it. The best I could expect would\r\nbe a long-drawn fight in the courts, and I can't afford it. I am going\r\nup. We've got something good here; we know it's good. And we'll prove\r\nit to the world by reaching the Dark Moon.\"\r\n\r\nAnother filmy, fibrous mass that had been torn from one of the\r\nmonsters of the heights slid from above to make a splotch of colorless\r\nmatter upon the floor.\r\n\r\nHarkness stared at it. The firm line of his lips set more firmly\r\nstill, but his eyes had another expression as he glanced at Chet. He\r\nwould go alone if he must; no barricade of unearthly beasts could hold\r\nhim from the great adventure. But Chet?--he must not lead Chet to his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" he said slowly, \"you've had one run-in with the brutes.\"\r\nAgain he paused. \"We don't know where they come from, but my guess is\r\nfrom the Dark Moon. They may be too much for us.... If you don't feel\r\nlike tackling them again--\"\r\n\r\nThe figure of Chet Bullard sprang upright from the cot. His harsh\r\nvoice told of the strain he had endured and his reaction from it.\r\n\r\n\"What are you trying to tell me?\" he demanded. \"Are you trying to\r\nleave me out?\" Then at the look in the other's eyes he grinned\r\nsheepishly at his own outburst.\r\n\r\nAnd Walter Harkness threw one arm across Chet's shoulder as he said;\r\n\"I hoped you would feel that way about it. Now let's make some plans.\"\r\n\r\nProvisions for one year! Even in concentrated form this made a\r\nprodigious supply. And, arms--pistols and rifles, with cases of\r\ncartridges whose every bullet was tipped with the deadly detonite--all\r\nthis was brought from the nearest accessible points. They landed,\r\nthough, in various cities, keeping Schwartzmann's ship as\r\ninconspicuous as possible, and made their purchases at different\r\nsupply houses to avoid too-pointed questioning. For Harkness found\r\nthat he and Bullard were marked men.\r\n\r\nThe newscaster in the Schwartzmann cabin brought the information. It\r\nbrought, too, continued reports of the menace in the upper air. It\r\ntold of patrol-ships sent down to destruction with no trace of\r\ncommander or crew; and a cruiser of the International Peace\r\nEnforcement Service came back with a story of horror and helplessness.\r\n\r\nTheir armament was useless. No shells could be timed to match the\r\nswift flight of the incredible monsters, and impact charges failed to\r\nexplode on contact; the filmy, fibrous masses offered little\r\nresistance to the shells that pierced them. Yet a wrecked after\r\ncompartment and smashed port-lights and doors gave evidence of the\r\nstrength of the brutes when their great sinuous bodies, lined with\r\nrows of suction discs, secured a hold.\r\n\r\n\"Speed!\" was Chet Bullard's answer to this, when the newscaster\r\nceased. \"Speed!--until we find something better. I got clear of them\r\nwhen they caught me unprepared, but we can rip right through them now\r\nthat we know what we're up against.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe had turned again to the packing of supplies, but Harkness was held\r\nby the sound of his own name.\r\n\r\nMr. Walter Harkness, late of New York, was very much in the day's\r\nnews. When a young millionaire loses all his wealth beneath a tidal\r\nwave; when, further, he flies to Vienna and transfers all rights in\r\nthe great firm of Harkness, Incorporated, to the Schwartzmann\r\ninterests in part settlement of his obligations; and, still further,\r\nwhen he is driven to fury by his losses and attacks the great Herr\r\nSchwartzmann in a murderous frenzy, wounds him and escapes in\r\nSchwartzmann's own ship--that is an item that is worth broadcasting\r\nbetween announcements of greater importance.\r\n\r\nIt interested Harkness, beyond a doubt. He remembered the shot outside\r\nthe cabin as he took off in his wild flight. Schwartzmann had been\r\nwounded, it seemed, and he was to be blamed for the assault. He\r\nsmiled grimly as he heard the warrant for his arrest broadcast. Every\r\npatrol-ship would be on the watch. And there would be a dozen\r\nwitnesses to swear to the truth of Schwartzmann's lie.\r\n\r\nThe plan seemed plain to him. He saw himself in custody; taken to\r\nVienna. And then, at the best, months of waiting in the psychopathic\r\nward of a great institution where the influence of Herr Schwartzmann\r\nwould not be slight. And, meanwhile, Schwartzmann would have his ship.\r\nClever! But not clever enough. He would fool them, he and Chet.\r\n\r\nAnd then he recalled the girl, Mademoiselle Diane, a slim figure\r\noutlined in a lighted window of the old chateau. Was there hope there?\r\nhe wondered. Had her clear, smiling eyes seen what occurred?\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense,\" he told himself. \"She saw nothing in that storm. And,\r\nbesides, she is one of their crowd--tarred with the same stick. Forget\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\nBut he knew, as he framed the unspoken words, that the advice was\r\nvain. He would never forget her. There was a picture in his mind that\r\ncould not be blotted out--a picture of a tall, slender girl, trim and\r\nstraight in her mannish attire, who came toward him from her little\r\nred speedster. She held out her hand impulsively, and her eyes were\r\nsmiling as she said; \"We will be generous, Monsieur Harkness--\"\r\n\r\n\"Generous!\" His smile was bitter as he turned to help Chet in their\r\nfinal work.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n_The Rescue in Space_\r\n\r\nHow often are the great things of life submerged beneath the trivial.\r\nThe vast reaches of space that must be traversed; the unknown world\r\nthat awaited them out there; its lands and seas and the life that was\r\nupon it: Walter Harkness was pondering all this deep within his mind.\r\nIt must have been the same with Chet, yet few words of speculation\r\nwere exchanged. Instead, the storage of supplies, a checking and\r\nrechecking of lists, additional careful testing of generators--such\r\ndetails absorbed them.\r\n\r\nAnd the heavy, gray powder with its admixture of radium that\r\ntransformed it to super-detonite--this must be carefully charged into\r\nthe magazines of the generators. A thousand such responsibilities--and\r\nyet the moment finally came when all was done.\r\n\r\nThe midnight sun shone redly from a distant horizon. It cast strange\r\nlights across the icy waste. And it flashed back in crimson splendor\r\nfrom the gleaming hull that floated from the hangar and came to rest\r\nupon the snowy world.\r\n\r\nThe two men closed the great doors, and it was as if they were\r\nshutting themselves off from their last contact with the world. They\r\nstood for long moments, silent, in the utter silence of the frozen\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nChet Bullard turned, and Harkness gripped his hand. He was suddenly\r\naware of his thankfulness for the companionship of this tall, blond\r\nyoungster. He tried to speak--but what words could express the tumult\r\nof emotions that arose within him? His throat was tight....\r\n\r\nIt was Chet who broke the tense silence; his happy grin flashed like\r\nsunshine across his lean face.\r\n\r\n\"You're right,\" he answered his companion's unspoken thoughts; \"it's a\r\ngreat little old world we're leaving. I wonder what the new one will\r\nbe like.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Harkness smiled back. \"Let's go!\" he said, and turned toward the\r\nwaiting ship.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe control room was lined with the instruments they had installed. A\r\nnitron illuminator flashed brilliantly upon shining levers--emergency\r\ncontrols that they hoped they would not have to use. Harkness placed\r\nhis hand upon a small metal ball as Chet reported all ports closed.\r\n\r\nThe ball hung free in space, supported by the magnetic attraction of\r\nthe curved bars that made a cage about it. An adaptation of the\r\nelectrol device that had appeared on the most modern ships, Harkness\r\nknew how to handle it. Each movement of the ball within its cage,\r\nwhere magnetic fields crossed and recrossed, would bring instant\r\nresponse. To lift the ball would be to lift the ship; a forward\r\npressure would throw their stern exhaust into roaring life that would\r\nhurl them forward; a circular motion would roll them over and over. It\r\nwas as if he held the ship itself within his hand.\r\n\r\nChet touched a button, and a white light flashed to confirm his report\r\nthat all was clear. Harkness gently raised the metal ball.\r\n\r\nBeneath them a soft thunder echoed from the field of snow, and came\r\nback faintly from icy peaks. The snow and ice fell softly away as they\r\nrose.\r\n\r\nA forward pressure upon the ball, and a louder roaring answered from\r\nthe stern. A needle quivered and swung over on a dial as their speed\r\nincreased. Beneath them was a blur of whirling white; ahead was an\r\nupthrust mountain range upon which they were driving. And Harkness\r\nthrilled with the sense of power that his fingers held as he gently\r\nraised the ball and nosed the ship upward in meteor-flight.\r\n\r\nThe floor beneath them swung with their change of pace. Without it,\r\nthey would have been thrown against the wall at their backs. The\r\nclouds that had been above them lay dead ahead; the ship was pointing\r\nstraight upward. It flashed silently into the banks of gray, through\r\nthem, and out into clear air above. And always the quivering needle\r\ncrept up to new marks of speed, while their altimeter marked off the\r\npassing levels.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey were through the repelling area when Harkness relinquished the\r\ncontrols to Chet. The metal ball hung unmoving; it would hold\r\nautomatically to the direction and speed that had been established.\r\nThe hand of the master-pilot found it quickly. They were in dangerous\r\nterritory now--a vast void under a ceiling of black, star-specked\r\nspace. No writhing, darting wraith-forms caught the rays of the\r\ndistant sun. Their way seemed clear.\r\n\r\nHarkness' eyes were straining ahead, searching for serpent forms, when\r\nthe small cone beside him hummed a warning that they were not alone.\r\nAnother ship in this zone of danger?--it seemed incredible. But more\r\nincredible was the scream that rang shrilly from the cone. \"Help! Oh,\r\nhelp me!\" a feminine voice implored.\r\n\r\nHarkness sprang for the instrument where the voice was calling. \"We\r\naren't the only fools up here,\" he exclaimed; \"and that's a woman's\r\nvoice, too!\" He pressed a button, and a needle swung instantly to\r\npoint the direction whence the radio waves were coming.\r\n\r\n\"Hard a-port!\" he ordered. \"Ten degrees, and hold her level. No--two\r\npoints down.\"\r\n\r\nBut Chet's steady hand had anticipated the order. He had seen the\r\ndirection-finder, and he swung the metal ball with a single motion\r\nthat swept them in a curve that seemed crushing them to the floor.\r\n\r\nThe ship levelled off; the ball was thrust forward, and the thunder\r\nfrom the stern was deafening despite their insulated walls. The\r\nshuddering structure beneath them was hurled forward till the needle\r\nof the speed-indicator jammed tightly against its farthest pin. And\r\nahead of them was no emptiness of space.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe air was alive with darting forms. Harkness saw them plainly\r\nnow--great trailing streamers of speed that shot downward from the\r\nheights. The sun caught them in their flight to make iridescent\r\nrainbow hues that would have been beautiful but for the hideous heads,\r\nthe sucker-discs that lined the bodies and the one great disc that\r\ncupped on the end of each thrusting snout.\r\n\r\nAnd beneath those that fell from on high was a cluster of the same\r\nsinister, writhing shapes which clung to a speeding ship that rolled\r\nand swung vainly in an effort to shake them off.\r\n\r\nThe coiling, slashing serpent-forms had fastened to the doomed ship.\r\nTheir thrashing bodies streamed out behind it. They made a cluster of\r\nflashing color whose center point was a tiny airship, a speedster, a\r\ngay little craft. And her sides shone red as blood--red as they had\r\nshone on the grassy lawn of an old chateau near far-off Vienna.\r\n\r\n\"It's Diane!\" Harkness was shouting. \"Good Lord, Chet, it's Diane!\"\r\n\r\nThis girl he had told himself he would forget. She was there in that\r\nship, her hands were wrenching at the controls in a fight that was\r\nhopeless. He saw her so plainly--a pitiful, helpless figure, fighting\r\nvainly against this nightmare attack.\r\n\r\nOnly an instant of blurred wonderment at her presence up there--then a\r\nfrenzy possessed him. He must save her! He leaped to the side of the\r\ncrouching pilot, but his outstretched hands that clutched at the\r\ncontrol stopped motionless in air.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet Bullard, master-pilot of the first rank, upon whose chest was the\r\ntriple star that gave him authority to command all the air-levels of\r\nearth, was tense and crouching. His eyes were sighting along an\r\ninstrument of his own devising as if he were aiming some super-gun of\r\na great air cruiser.\r\n\r\nBut he was riding the projectile itself and guiding it as he rode. He\r\nthrew the ship like a giant shell in a screaming, sweeping arc upon\r\nthe red craft that drove across their bow.\r\n\r\nThey were crashing upon it; the red speedster swelled instantly before\r\ntheir eyes. Harkness winced involuntarily from the crash that never\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nChet must have missed it by inches, Harkness knew; but he knew, too,\r\nthat the impact he felt was no shattering of metal upon metal. The\r\nheavy windows of the control room went black with the masses of\r\nfibrous flesh that crashed upon them; then cleared in an instant as\r\nthe ship swept through.\r\n\r\nBehind them a red ship was falling--falling free! And vaporous masses,\r\nripped to ribbons, were falling, too, while other wraith-like forms\r\nclosed upon them in cannibalistic feasting.\r\n\r\nTheir terrific speed swept them on into space. When the pilot could\r\ncheck it, and turn, they found that the red ship was gone.\r\n\r\n\"After it!\" Harkness was shouting. \"She went down out of control, but\r\nthey didn't get her. They've only sprung the door-ports a crack,\r\nreleasing the internal pressure.\" He told himself this was true; he\r\nwould not admit for an instant the possible truth of the vision that\r\nflashed through his mind--a ripping of doors--a thrusting snout that\r\nwrithed in where a girl stood fighting.\r\n\r\n\"Get it!\" he ordered; \"get it! I'll stand by for rescue.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe sprang for the switch that controlled the great rescue magnets. Not\r\noften were they used, but every ship must have them: it was so\r\nordered by the Board of Control. And every ship had an inset of iron\r\nin its non-magnetic hull.\r\n\r\nHis hand was upon the switch in an agony of waiting. Outside were\r\nother beastly shapes, like no horror of earth, that came slantingly\r\nupon them, but even their speed was unequal to the chase of this new\r\ncraft that left them far astern. Harkness saw the last ones vanish as\r\nChet drove down through the repelling area. And he had eyes only for\r\nthe first sight of the tiny ship that had fallen so helplessly.\r\n\r\nAhead and below them the sun marked a brilliant red dot. It was\r\nfalling with terrific speed, and yet, so swift was their own pace, it\r\ntook form too quickly: they would overshoot the mark.... Harkness felt\r\nthe ship shudder in slackening speed as the blast from the bow roared\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThey were turning; aiming down. The red shape passed from view where\r\nHarkness stood. His hand was tight upon the heavy switch.\r\n\r\nChet's voice came sharp and clear: \"Rescue switch--ready?\" He appeared\r\nas cool and steady as if he were commanding on an experimental test\r\ninstead of making his first rescue in the air. And Harkness answered:\r\n\"Ready.\"\r\n\r\nA pause. To the waiting man it was an eternity of suspense. Then,\r\n\"Contact!\" Chet shouted, and Harkness' tense muscles threw the current\r\ninto crashing life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe felt the smash and jar as the two ships came together. He knew that\r\nthe great magnets in their lower hull had gripped the plates on the\r\ntop of the other ship. He was certain that the light fans of the\r\nsmaller craft must have been crushed; but they had the little red\r\nspeedster in an unshakable grip; and they would land it gently. And\r\nthen--then he would know!\r\n\r\nThe dreadful visions in his mind would not down.... Chet's voice\r\nbroke in upon him.\r\n\r\n\"I can't maintain altitude,\" Chet was saying. \"Our vertical blasts\r\nstrike upon the other ship; they are almost neutralized.\" He pointed\r\nto a needle that was moving with slow certainty and deadly persistence\r\nacross a graduated dial. It was their low-level altimeter, marking\r\ntheir fall. Harkness stared at it in stunned understanding.\r\n\r\n\"We can't hold on,\" the pilot was saying; \"We'll crash sure as fate.\r\nBut I'm darned if we'll ever let go!\"\r\n\r\nHarkness made no reply. He had dashed for an after-compartment to\r\ntheir storage place of tools, and returned with a blow-torch in his\r\nhand. He lit it and checked its blue flame to a needle of fire.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Chet,\" he said, and the note of command in his voice told who\r\nwas in charge, at the final analysis, in this emergency. \"I will be\r\ndown below. You call out when we are down to twenty thousand: I can\r\nstand the thin air there. I will open the emergency slot in the lower\r\nhull.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're going down?\" Chet asked. He glanced at the torch and nodded\r\nhis understanding. \"Going to cut your way through and--\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll get her if she's there to get,\" Harkness told him grimly. \"At\r\nfive hundred, if I'm not back, pull the switch.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe pilot's reply came with equal emphasis. \"Make it snappy,\" he said:\r\n\"this collision instrument has picked up the signals of five\r\npatrol-ships a hundred miles to the south.\"\r\n\r\nThey dropped swiftly to the twenty level, and Harkness heard the\r\ndeafening roar of their lower exhausts as he opened the slot in their\r\nship's hull. He dropped to the red surface held close beneath, while\r\nthe cold gripped him and the whirling blasts of air tore at him. But\r\nthe torch did its work, and he lowered himself into the cabin of the\r\nlittle craft that had been the plaything of Mademoiselle Diane.\r\n\r\nThe cabin was a splintered wreck, where a horrible head had smashed in\r\nsearch of food. One entrance port was torn open, and the head itself\r\nstill hung where it had lodged. The mouth gaped flabbily open; above\r\nit was the suction cup that formed a snout; and above that, a row of\r\nstaring, sightless eyes. Chet had slammed into the mass of serpents\r\njust in time, Harkness realized. Just in time, or just too late....\r\n\r\nThe door to the control room was sprung and jammed. He pried it open\r\nto see the unconscious body that lay huddled upon the floor. But he\r\nknew, with a wave of thankfulness that was suffocating, that the brute\r\nhad not reached her; only the slow release of the air-pressure had\r\nrendered her unconscious. He was beside her in an instant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was dimly aware of the thunder of exhausts and the shrill scream of\r\nhelicopters as he reached the upper surface of the red ship and forced\r\nhis unconscious burden into the emergency slot above his head.\r\n\r\n\"They're here!\" Chet was shouting excitedly. \"We're ordered to halt.\r\nLooks as if our flight was postponed.\" He tried to smile, but the\r\nexperiment was a failure.\r\n\r\n\"I am dodging around to keep that big one from grabbing us with its\r\nmagnet. Schwartzmann is aboard one of the patrols; they think the girl\r\nis in her ship. They won't fire on us as long as we hang on. But we'll\r\ncrash if we do that, and they'll nail us if we let go.\"\r\n\r\nHarkness had placed the girl's body upon the floor. His answer was a\r\nquick leap to the pilot's side. \"See to her,\" he ordered; \"I'll take\r\nthe ship. Stop us now? Like hell they will! What's all our power\r\nfor?\"\r\n\r\nOne glance gave him the situation: the big gray fighter above,\r\nslipping down to seize them with her powerful magnets; four other\r\npatrol cruisers that slowly circled, their helicopters holding them\r\neven with the two ships that clung together in swift descent.\r\n\r\nChet was right; no burst of speed could save them from the guns of the\r\npatrols if they dropped the red speedster and made a break for it.\r\nThey thought Diane was still in her ship, and a patrol would have the\r\nlittle craft safe before she had dropped a thousand feet. Their own\r\nstern exhaust would be torn by a detonite shell, and the big cruiser\r\nwould seize them in the same way. No--they must hang onto the girl's\r\nship and outmaneuver the others. He pressed the metal ball forward to\r\nthe limit of its space, and the stern exhaust crashed into action with\r\nall the suddenness of his own resolve.\r\n\r\nThe ship beneath him threw itself straight ahead, flashed under the\r\npatrol-ship that blocked them, and was away. The weight below, and its\r\nresistance to the air, dragged them down, but Harkness brought the\r\nball up, and the ship answered with a slow lift of the bow that aimed\r\nthem straight out into space.\r\n\r\nA vertical climb!--and the voice from the instrument beside him was\r\nshouting orders to halt. On each side were patrol-ships that roared\r\nupward with him.\r\n\r\n\"Cut those motors!\" the voice commanded. \"Release that ship! Halt, or\r\nwe will fire!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHarkness threw his ship into a wild spiral for reply, and the thin\r\ncrack of guns came to him from outside. Down! A headlong dive! Then\r\nout and up again!\r\n\r\nHe was through the repelling area in a twisting, rocking flight. Not\r\nhit as yet; they had to aim carefully to avoid damaging the red\r\ncraft.... He was straining his eyes for a glimpse of serpent-forms,\r\nand he laughed softly under his breath at thought of his strange\r\nallies. Laughed!--until he saw them coming.\r\n\r\nHe slammed down the switch on his own broadcast sender. \"Back!\" he\r\nshouted; \"back, all of you! Look up! Look above you! The monsters are\r\ncoming!--the air-beasts!--they are attacking!\"\r\n\r\nHe threw his own ship into a dive; saw the others do likewise; then\r\nleaped for the switch on the rescue magnets and pulled it open.\r\n\r\nHe felt the red ship fall clear. He swung his own ship free and aimed\r\nit out and up on a long line of speed. Beside him a voice from a\r\ndistant, fleeing patrol was shouting; \"Come back, you fool! Down!\r\nDown, through the R. A.!\"\r\n\r\nOne backward glance showed him that his pursuers were safe. The\r\nserpents had turned to pursue him, and other writhing luminosities\r\nwere falling from above. He swung head on, his motors wide open, his\r\nspeed building up and up, to crash softly through the advance guard of\r\nthe giant creatures out of space.\r\n\r\nNothing could stop him! He was trembling with the knowledge, and with\r\nthe sheer joy of the adventure. Nothing could check them; neither\r\ncruisers nor monsters; nothing of earth or of space. They were free;\r\nthey were on their way out--out where a new world awaited--where the\r\nDark Moon raced on her unlighted path!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor the moment he had forgotten their passenger. The thrill of combat\r\nand the ecstasy of winning freedom for their great adventure had\r\nfilled him to forgetfulness of all else.\r\n\r\n\"We're off!\" he shouted. \"Off for the Dark Moon!\" Then he remembered,\r\nand turned where Chet was supporting the head of a slim girl whose\r\neyes opened to look about, to glance from Chet to Harkness and back to\r\nChet who was holding her.\r\n\r\n\"You saved me,\" she breathed, \"from them!\" She raised one hand weakly\r\nto cover her eyes at memory of those writhing shapes, then let it fall\r\nas other memories crowded in.\r\n\r\n\"The patrol-ships!\" she exclaimed breathlessly. \"You must....\" Her\r\nvoice trailed off into silence.\r\n\r\nShe was able to stand, and with Chet's help she came slowly to her\r\nfeet as Harkness reached her. His voice was harsh and scornful; all\r\nelation had left him. He forced himself to hold his unsmiling gaze\r\nsteadily upon the soft brown eyes that turned to his.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said; \"we must 'surrender'--that was the word you wanted. We\r\nmust surrender!... Well, Mam'selle Diane, we're not in a surrendering\r\nmood to-day. We've got away; made our escape!\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed loudly and contemptuously, though he winced at the look of\r\nhurt that opened the brown eyes wide.\r\n\r\n\"You brought the patrol,\" he went on; \"you learned where we were--\"\r\n\r\n\"Herr Schwartzmann did,\" she interrupted in a quiet voice. \"He located\r\nyou; your signals were picked up.... They left two hours before I\r\ndid,\" she added enigmatically. \"I had to fly high, above the R. A. for\r\ngreater speed.\"\r\n\r\nWalt Harkness was bewildered. What did this mean? He tried to preserve\r\nthe pose of hard indifference that was becoming increasingly\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\n\"More generosity?\" he inquired. \"You had to see the end of the\r\nhunt--be in at the death?\"\r\n\r\n\"In at the death!\" she echoed, and laughed in a tone that trembled and\r\nbroke. \"I nearly was, truly. But, no, my dear Monsieur Harkness:\r\nincredible as it seems, in view of your unfriendly reception, I came\r\nto warn you!... But, enough of that. Tell me--you see how interested\r\nI am in your plans?--what did you say of the Dark Moon?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWalter Harkness tried to rearrange his jumbled thoughts. She had come\r\nto warn them. Was this true? Or was this girl, who laughed so lightly,\r\nplaying with him?\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said dully, \"we were bound for the Dark Moon. The Patrol\r\ncouldn't stop us, nor the beasts that have paralyzed the flying\r\nservice of the earth; but you have done it. We will turn back at once,\r\nand return you safely--\"\r\n\r\nHe was again at the controls, one hand extended for the metal ball,\r\nwhen her slim hand closed upon his wrist.\r\n\r\n\"I know Herr Schwartzmann's plans,\" she said quietly. \"He would ruin\r\nyou; seize your ship; steal for himself the glory of your invention.\r\nWould you go back and deliver yourself into his hands--because of me?\"\r\n\r\nThe brown eyes, Harkness found, were upon his with an expression he\r\ncould not fathom.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said simply.\r\n\r\nAnd still the eyes looked into his. There was laughter in them, and\r\nsomething else whose meaning was concealed.\r\n\r\n\"I ask you not to do this,\" she was saying. \"You will succeed; I read\r\nit in your face. Let me go with you; let me share in the adventure. I\r\nam begging this of you. It is your turn to be generous.\"\r\n\r\nHarkness' hand upon the metal ball held it motionless within its\r\nenclosing cage. From astern there came to him the muffled roar of a\r\nblast that drove them on and out into space--black, velvety space,\r\nthick-studded with sharp points of light.... He stared into that\r\nwondrous night, then back into the eyes that looked steadily,\r\nunfathomably, into his.... And his hand was unresisting as the\r\nstrong, slender fingers about his wrist drew it back....\r\n\r\nThey were off for the Dark Moon: their journey, truly, was begun. And\r\nthis girl, whom he had told himself to forget, was going with them.\r\nThere was much that he did not understand, but he knew that he was\r\nglad with a gladness that transcended all previous thrills of the\r\nperilous plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n_The \"Dark Moon\"_\r\n\r\nThey were seated in the cabin of the man-made meteor that the brain of\r\nHarkness had conceived--two men and a girl. And they stared at one\r\nanother unsmilingly, with eyes which reflected their comprehension of\r\nthe risks that they ran and the dangers which lay ahead in the dark\r\nvoid. Yet the brown eyes of Mam'selle Diane, no less than the others,\r\nwere afire with the thrill of adventure--the same response to the same\r\nlure that has carried men to each new exploration--or to their death.\r\n\r\nBehind them, a rear lookout port framed a picture of awful majesty.\r\nThe earth was a great disc, faintly luminous in a curtain of dead\r\nblack. From beyond it, a hidden sun made glorious flame of the disc's\r\nentire rim. And, streaming toward it, a straight, blasting line from\r\ntheir stern exhaust, was an arrow of blue.\r\n\r\nIt had taken form slowly, that arrow of blue fire, and Harkness\r\nanswered an unspoken question from the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Hydrogen and oxygen,\" he explained. \"It is an explosive mixture at\r\nthis height, but too thin to take fire. It will pass. Beyond this is\r\npure hydrogen. And then, nothing.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned to switch on their radio receiver, and he set it for the\r\nnewscasting waves that went forth from the most powerful station of\r\nEarth, the Press Tower of New York. A voice came to them faintly. For\r\na time it vied with the muffled roar of their thundering exhaust; then\r\nit lost volume, faded, and was finally gone.\r\n\r\nTheir last contact with Earth was severed. There remained only\r\nblackness, and a great abyss through which they were plunging.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHarkness busied himself with calculations. He would have spoken, but\r\nthe silence that followed the vanished voice of Earth had robbed his\r\nown voice of control.\r\n\r\nA telescope sight was fixed rigid with the axis of their ship. He\r\nlooked through it, moved their controls, and brought the cross-hairs\r\nof his instrument to bear upon a star.\r\n\r\n\"That's about right,\" he said quietly. \"I got all the information that\r\nthe observatories had on the orbit of the Dark Moon. It is circling\r\nthe Earth from north to south. It coincided for a short time with our\r\nown moon when it first hit; that's what kicked up the big wave and\r\njarred us up. But it swung off and seems to have settled down in its\r\nown orbit now.\r\n\r\n\"Two hundred thousand miles away is what they make it, though I think\r\nthat is more or less of a guess. I wish we could measure our speed.\"\r\nHe looked at the earth-induction speed-indicator. Useless now, it\r\nregistered zero.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he added, \"we are shooting for the North Star. We will pass\r\nclose to the Dark Moon's orbit; it should be about over the Pole on\r\nthis date. And there is one good safe bet, anyhow; there is nothing\r\nbetween here and there to stop us.\"\r\n\r\nHe was being weakly facetious, but his efforts met with an\r\nenthusiastic response. The tension of the moment, it was plain, had\r\nnot affected Harkness alone. But it was many hours before the error of\r\nhis statement was made manifest to all.\r\n\r\nAn island, faintly luminous, lay ahead. It grew to enormous size as\r\nthey dashed upon it. Harkness sprang for the controls, but, before he\r\ncould reach them, they had struck the vast field of pale green light,\r\nflashed through it, and left it diminishing in size behind them. Then,\r\nother lights, not brilliant, but like phosphorescent bodies, that came\r\nand went and flashed by with blinding speed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother luminous area rushed at them from ahead. At first it was a\r\nspeck, then an island, and then a continent in size, and through it\r\nmoved other brighter lights. This time a slight suggestion of an\r\nimpact was felt. Here was matter of a form they could not guess. It\r\nwas Chet who pointed to the glass of their control room. The heavy\r\nlights of the lookouts were smeared with sticky fluid that drew\r\ntogether in trickling streams.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing between us and the Dark Moon?\" he asked of Harkness. \"And\r\nspace is an empty void? We Earth-creatures are a conceited lot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Meaning?\" the girl questioned.\r\n\r\n\"Meaning that because we live on Earth--walk on solid ground, swim in\r\nthe water and fly in the air--we deny the existence of life in space.\r\nThere's the answer written in the blood of some life that was snuffed\r\nout as we hit it.\"\r\n\r\nHarkness shook his head doubtfully. \"Matter of some sort,\" he\r\nadmitted, \"and the serpents came from somewhere; but, as for the rest,\r\nthe idea that the ocean of space is filled with life as our\r\nEarth-oceans are--creatures living and moving through unknown fields\r\nof force....\" He did not finish the denial, but looked with wondering\r\ngaze at the myriad points that flashed softly into glowing masses and\r\ndarted aside before their onward rush.\r\n\r\nIt was hours later that he checked their flight. Slowly at first he\r\ncut off the exhaust from their stern and opened the bow valve.\r\nSlowly, for their wild speed must slacken as it had been built up, by\r\nslow degrees. The self-adjusting floor swung forward and up. Their\r\ndeceleration was like the pull of gravity, and now straight ahead\r\nseemed down.\r\n\r\nMore hours, and they were at rest, floating in an ethereal ocean, an\r\nocean teeming with strange life. Each face was pressed close to a\r\nlookout port. No one of the three could speak; each was too absorbed\r\nin the story his eyes were reading--this story of a strange, new\r\nexistence where no life should have been.\r\n\r\nAnimalculae. They came in swarms; cloud masses of them floated past;\r\nand swirls of phosphorescent fire marked the presence of larger\r\ncreatures that moved among them. Large and small, each living creature\r\nwas invisible until it moved; then came the greenish light, like\r\nphosphorescence and yet unlike.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStill Harkness could not force himself to believe the irrefutable\r\nevidence. What of astronomy? he asked himself. Why was this matter not\r\nvisible through telescopes? Why did it not make its presence known\r\nthrough interference? Through refraction of light?... And then he\r\nrealized the incredible distance within the scope of his vision; he\r\nknew that this swarming life was actually more widely spaced; and the\r\nlight of a brilliant star shone toward him through the center of a\r\nliving mass to prove that here was matter that offered no resistance\r\nto the passage of light.\r\n\r\nA void of nothingness was before his eyes. He saw its black emptiness\r\nchange to pale green fire that swirled and fled before a large shape.\r\nThe newcomer swept down like light itself. Softly green like the\r\nothers, its rounded body was outlined in a huge circle of orange\r\nlight. Like a cyclopean pod, it was open at one end, and that open end\r\nclosed and opened and closed again as the creature gulped in uncounted\r\nmillions of the tiny, luminous dots--every one, as Harkness now knew,\r\na living thing.\r\n\r\nStrange light whirled into life and vanished, each evidencing a battle\r\nwhere life took life in this ocean of the invisible living. A gasp\r\nfrom the girl brought Harkness quickly about.\r\n\r\n\"Another one!\" she said breathlessly, and pointed where the blackness\r\nwas looped with writhing fire. It came swiftly near to show the\r\noutline of the dread serpent form; the suction cups showed plainly.\r\n\r\nDanger was in this thing, Harkness knew, but it passed them by before\r\nhe could move. The further lookout showed two gleaming monsters locked\r\ntogether in deadly embrace. So swift was their whirling motion that\r\ndetails of form were lost: only a confusion of lashing tentacles that\r\nwhipped and tore, and one glimpse of a savage maw that sheared the\r\ntentacles off. Then the serpent was upon them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHarkness had seen one time a sight that was indelibly impressed upon\r\nhis memory. A steeloid cable had broken under a terrific strain; the\r\nend of it had lashed out with a speed the eye could not follow, to\r\nwind itself around the superstructure of a submarine--and the men who\r\nwere gathered there.\r\n\r\nHe thought of that now, saw again the bleeding mass that had been an\r\ninstant before a group of humans, as the serpent seized its prey. The\r\ntwo combatants were encircled in a living coil of light. Then, as\r\nmotion ceased, the ethereal sea went dark except for pulsing suction\r\ncups that drew and strained at the bodies they held.\r\n\r\nHarkness was groping for the controls--he saw too plainly their own\r\nhelplessness when they were at rest--but the voice of Dianne checked\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"That bright star went out,\" she said; and Harkness let his gaze\r\nfollow where she pointed.\r\n\r\nThe stars that were distant suns shone in brilliant points of light;\r\nno atmosphere here to dim them or cause a flickering. A bright point\r\nvanished as she looked--another!--and he knew abruptly that he was\r\nseeing a circle of blackness that moved slowly between them and the\r\nstars.\r\n\r\n\"The Moon!\" he shouted. \"The Dark Moon!\" And now his hand found the\r\ncontrols that threw their ship into thunderous life. It was\r\napproaching! He swung the metal ball to throw them ahead and to one\r\nside, and the roar from the stern told of the fast-growing speed that\r\nwas pressing them to the floor....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn hour of wild flight, and the circle was close upon them. Too\r\nfaintly lighted to register in the telescopes of Earth, there was\r\nstill enough of luminosity to mark it as a round disc of violet that\r\ngrew dimly bluish-green around the edge.\r\n\r\nIt ceased to grow. Their ship, Harkness knew, was speeding beside it\r\nsome hundreds of miles away. But they were within its gravitational\r\npull, and were falling toward it. And he aimed his ship bow-on to make\r\nthe forward blast a check upon their falling speed.\r\n\r\nThe circle broadened; became a sphere; and then they were plunging\r\nthrough clouds more tenuous than any vapors of Earth--thick layers of\r\ngas that reflected no rays from the distant sun.\r\n\r\nBeside them a sinuous form showed where a serpent of space was trying\r\nto match their speed. Harkness saw it twisting convulsively in the\r\nstratum of gas; it was falling, lifeless, beside them as they sped on\r\nand away. Here was something the beasts could not combat. He made a\r\nmental note of the fact, but his thoughts flashed again to what lay\r\nahead.\r\n\r\nEvery eye was held close to the lookouts that faced forward. The three\r\nwere breathless, wordless; the hand of Harkness that held the tiny\r\nball was all that moved.\r\n\r\nAhead of them was their goal, the Dark Moon! And they were prepared\r\nfor Stygian darkness and a land of perpetual night. The almost\r\ninvisible gas-clouds thinned; there was a glow ahead that grew\r\nbrilliant as they watched; and then, with a blinding suddenness that\r\nmade them shield their eyes, there flashed before them a world of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nEach line of shore was marked distinctly there; the blue and violet of\r\nrippling seas were blended with unreal hues; there were mountains\r\nupthrust and, on the horizon, a range of volcanic peaks that poured\r\nforth flashing eruptions half-blanketed by invisible gas.\r\n\r\n\"The Dark Moon!\" gasped Harkness. He was spellbound with utter awe at\r\nthe spectacle he beheld. This brilliant world a-gleam to its farthest\r\nhorizon with golden, glorious sunlight, softly spread and diffused!\r\nThis, _this!_ was the Dark Moon!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe turned to share with the others the delirium of ecstatic wonder too\r\noverpowering to be borne alone--turned, to find his happiness shot\r\nthrough with a pang of regret. He saw Chet and Diane. They had been\r\nstanding together at a wide forward lookout; and now she was holding\r\none hand of the pilot to her breast in an embrace of passionate joy.\r\n\r\nUnconscious, that gesture of delight at this climax of their perilous\r\ntrip?--Harkness told himself that this was so. But he swung back to\r\nthe helm of the ship. He glanced at instruments that again were\r\nregistering; he saw the air-pressure indicator that told of oxygen\r\nand an atmosphere where men might live. He gauged his distance\r\ncarefully, and prepared to land.\r\n\r\nThe moment of depression could not last, for there was too much here\r\nto fill brain and eyes. What would they find? Was there life? His\r\nquestion was answered by an awkward body that flapped from beneath\r\nthem on clumsy wings. He glimpsed a sinuous neck, a head that was all\r\nmouth and flabby pouch, and the mouth opened ludicrously in what was\r\ndoubtless a cry of alarm.\r\n\r\nThen land, that took form and detail; a mountain whose curled top was\r\nlike a frozen wave of stone. In a valley below it trees were growing.\r\nThey swayed in a wind, and their branches reached upward and flowed\r\nand waved like seaweed on the ocean's floor. Green--vivid, glowing\r\ngreen!--and reds and purples that might be flowers and fruit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn open space in a little valley spread invitingly before him, and he\r\nlaid the ship down there in a jungle of lush grasses--set it down as\r\ngently as if he were landing from a jaunt of a thousand miles instead\r\nof two hundred times that distance straight away from Earth.\r\n\r\nThe others were looking at him with glowing, excited eyes. In the\r\ncabin was silence. Harkness felt that he must speak, must say\r\nsomething worthy of the moment--something to express in slight degree\r\nthe upwelling emotion that filled them all, three adventurers about to\r\nset foot upon a virgin world....\r\n\r\nThe pause was long-drawn, until he ended it in a voice that had all\r\nthe solemn importance of a head-steward's announcement on a liner of\r\nthe high-level service. But the corners of his lips were twitching to\r\na little smile.\r\n\r\n\"This,\" he announced, \"is as far as we go. This is the end of our\r\nrun.\"\r\n\r\nThe tension that had held them emotionally taut was ended. With\r\noutstretched hands Diane ran toward him, and her broken laugh betrayed\r\nthe hysteria she was holding back.\r\n\r\n\"Congratulations!\" she cried, and clung tightly to his hands.\r\n\"Congratulations, M'sieu Walter--\"\r\n\r\nHer voice choked and she could not go on; but the eyes that were\r\nraised to his were luminous through the tears that filled them.\r\n\r\nFrom the cabin beyond came a clash of levers, where Chet was preparing\r\nto open a port. And Harkness followed with unseeing eyes where the\r\npilot waited that their commander might be the first to step forth\r\nupon an unknown globe--upon the surface of what men had called \"The\r\nDark Moon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n_Trapped_\r\n\r\nWalter Harkness, piloting his ship to a slow, safe landing on a new\r\nworld, had watched his instruments with care. He had seen the outer\r\npressure build up to that of the air of Earth; the spectro-analyzer\r\nhad shown nitrogen preponderating, with sufficient oxygen to support\r\nlife. And, below him, a monstrous thing that flopped hurriedly away on\r\nleather wings had told him that life was there.\r\n\r\nBut what would that life be? This was the question uppermost in the\r\nminds of all three as they stepped forth--the first of Earth's people\r\nto ask the question and to find the answer.\r\n\r\nChet had gone to their stores. He strapped a belt about his waist, a\r\nbelt banded with a row of detonite cartridges, and a pistol hung at\r\nhis hip. He handed another to Harkness. But the pistol he offered\r\nDiane was refused.\r\n\r\n\"My many accomplishments,\" she laughed, \"do not include that. I never\r\ncould shoot--and besides I will not need to with both of you here.\"\r\nHer hand was resting confidently upon Chet's arm as they followed\r\nwhere Harkness led.\r\n\r\nThe heavy grass, standing waist-high in the little valley where their\r\nship was at rest, stirred to ripples of vivid green as a light breeze\r\ntouched it. Above, the sun shone warm upon this world of tropical\r\ngrowth. Harkness, listening in the utter silence for sounds that might\r\nmean danger, let his eyes follow up the rugged wall of rock that\r\nhemmed them in on two sides. It gleamed with metallic hues in the\r\nmidday glare. He looked on to the sun above.\r\n\r\n\"A dark moon!\" he said wonderingly. \"Dark!--and yet it is blazing\r\nbright. Why can't we see it from Earth? Why is it dark?... I've an\r\nidea that the gas we came through is the answer. There is metal, we\r\nknow, that conducts an electric current in only one direction: why not\r\na gas that will do the same with light?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe pilot was listening, but Diane seemed uninterested in scientific\r\nspeculations. \"The trees!\" she breathed in rapture; \"the marvelous,\r\nbeautiful trees!\"\r\n\r\nShe was gazing toward distant towering growths where the valley\r\nwidened. Like no trees of Earth, these monsters towered high in air,\r\ntheir black trunks branching to end in tendrils that raised high above\r\nthem. And the tendrils were a waving, ever-moving sea of color, where\r\nrainbow iridescence was stabbed through with the flash of crimson\r\nbuds. A down-draft of air brought a heady, intoxicating odor.\r\n\r\nAnd still there was silence. To Walter Harkness, standing motionless\r\nand alert amidst the waving grass, it seemed a hush of waiting. A\r\nprickle of apprehension passed over his skin. He glanced about, his\r\npistol ready in his hand, looked back for a moment at the ship, then\r\nsmiled inwardly in self-derision of his fear as he strode forward.\r\n\r\n\"Let's have a look at things,\" he said with a heartiness not entirely\r\nsincere. \"We'll discover nothing standing here.\"\r\n\r\nBut the silence weighed upon them all as they pressed on. No\r\nexclamations of amazement from them now, no speculations of what might\r\nlie ahead. Only wide-eyed alertness and a constant listening,\r\nlistening--until the silence was broken by a scream.\r\n\r\nA man it seemed at first, when Harkness saw the figure leap outward\r\nfrom the cliff. A second one followed. They landed on all fours upon a\r\nrock that jutted outward toward the trees.\r\n\r\nThe impact would have killed a human, but these creatures stood\r\nupright to face the concealment from which they had sprung. One was\r\ncovered with matted, brown hair. Its arms were long, and its fists\r\npounded upon a barrel-like chest, while it growled hoarsely. The other\r\nape-thing, naked and hairless, did the same. They were both uttering\r\nthose sounds, that at times seemed almost like grunted words, when the\r\nend came.\r\n\r\nA swishing of leather wings!--a swooping, darting rush of a huge\r\nbody!--and one of the ape-men, as Harkness had mentally termed them,\r\nwas struggling in the clutch of talons that gripped him fast.\r\n\r\nThe giant bat-shape that had seized him reached for the other, too. A\r\ntalon ripped at the naked face, but the ape-man dodged and vanished\r\namong the rocks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith pounding wings, the bat swept off in lumbering flight, but with\r\nits burden it seemed heavy, and failed to rise. The trees were close,\r\nand their waving tentacles drew back, then shot out to splash about\r\nthe intruder. The talons released their hold, and the huge leather\r\nwings flapped frantically; but too late. Both captor and captive were\r\nwrapped in an embrace of iridescent arms and held struggling in\r\nmid-air, while the unmoving watchers below stood in horror before this\r\ndrama of life and death.\r\n\r\nThen a red bud opened. It was enormous, and its flowery beauty made\r\nmore revolting the spectacle of the living food that was thrust within\r\nits maw.\r\n\r\nThe bud closed. Its petals were like lips.... And Diane, in\r\nwhite-faced horror, was clinging to the protecting arm of Chet Bullard\r\nbeside her. Chet, too, had paled beneath his tan. But Walter Harkness,\r\nthough white of face, was staring not at the crimson bud, shut tightly\r\nabout its living food, but upward toward the broken, rocky face of the\r\ncliff.\r\n\r\nThe flying thing, the unnamed horror of the air, had come silently\r\nfrom on high. None of them had seen it until it struck, and he was\r\nsure that the ape-men had been taken unaware. Then what had frightened\r\nthem? What other horror had driven them in screaming terror to that\r\nfearful spring out into the open where they must have known danger\r\nawaited?\r\n\r\nDid a rock move? he wondered. Was the splotch of color--that mottling\r\nof crimson and copper and gray--a part of the metallic mass? He rubbed\r\nhis smarting eyes--and when he looked again the color was gone. But he\r\nhad a conviction that eyes, sinister and deadly, had been staring into\r\nhis, that a living mass had withdrawn softly into a shadowed cave, and\r\nthat the menace that had threatened the ape-men was directed now\r\ntoward them.\r\n\r\nWas this the reason for the silence? Was this valley, so peaceful in\r\nits sunlit stillness, a place of death, from which all living things\r\nkept clear? Had the ape-men been drawn there through curiosity at\r\nseeing their ship float down?\r\n\r\nAnd the quiet beauty of the valley--it might be as horrible a mockery\r\nas the blazing splendor of those things ahead--those beautiful and\r\nhorrible eaters of flesh! His voice was unsteady as he turned toward\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\n\"Let's call this off,\" he said: \"there is something up there. We'll go\r\nback to the ship and get up in the air again. We'll find a healthier\r\nplace to land.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLike Harkness, Chet Bullard held his pistol ready in his hand.\r\n\"Something else?\" he inquired. \"You saw something?\" And Harkness\r\nnodded grimly.\r\n\r\nThey retraced their steps. A half-mile, perhaps. It had seemed long as\r\nthey ventured forth, and was no shorter now. And the gleaming, silvery\r\nshape of the ship was entirely lovely to their eyes as they\r\napproached.\r\n\r\nHarkness circled the blunt bow with its open exhaust high above his\r\nhead. On the far side was the port where they had emerged; its open\r\ndoor would be welcome in its promise of safe seclusion. His sigh of\r\nrelief was echoed by the two who followed, for the horror and\r\napprehension had been felt by all. But the breath choked abruptly in\r\nhis throat.\r\n\r\nBefore them was the door, its thick metal wide-swung as they had left\r\nit. But the doorway itself, where warm darkness should have invited,\r\nwas entirely sealed by a web of translucent stuff.\r\n\r\nHarkness approached to look more closely. The substance was glistening\r\nand smooth--yellowish--almost transparent. It was made up of a tangle\r\nof woven cords which clung tightly to the metal sides. Harkness\r\nreached out in sudden fury to grip it and tear it loose. He grasped\r\nthe slippery stuff, stumbled--and hung suspended by a tenacious hold\r\nthat gripped his hand where it had touched, and would not let go.\r\n\r\nHis arm swung against it, and his shoulder. They were instantly\r\nimmovable. And he knew in a single terrifying instant his utter\r\nhelplessness. He saw Chet Bullard's hands come up, and he found his\r\nvoice in time to scream a harsh warning to him.\r\n\r\n\"Tear me loose!\" he commanded, \"but don't touch the damned stuff!\" It\r\ntook the combined strength of the pilot and the girl to free him, and\r\nHarkness had to set his teeth to restrain an exclamation of pain as\r\nhis hand came slowly from the web that clung and clung and would not\r\nlet go.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom his place upon the ground he saw Chet raise a broken piece of\r\nrock. It was like metal, and heavy, as the pilot's efforts proved,\r\nthough it was surprisingly small in size. He saw Chet raise it above\r\nhis head and crash it upon the thick web that filled the door. And, as\r\nhis own aching arm had been held, the rock was seized in the tough\r\nstrands, which gave back only slightly under the blow.\r\n\r\nHarkness scrambled to his feet. The fury that had possessed him made\r\nthe hurt of his arm unfelt. What devil's work was this that barred\r\nthem from the safety of the ship? The memory of that other menace,\r\nhalf-seen among the rocks, was strong upon him.\r\n\r\n\"Stand back!\" he shouted to Chet and the girl, and he raised his\r\npistol to send a charge of detonite into the unyielding mass. Here was\r\npower to tear the clinging-stuff to atoms.\r\n\r\nHe felt Chet's body plunge upon him an instant before he fired, and\r\nhis pistol was knocked up and flew outward from his hand. He heard\r\nthe pilot's voice.\r\n\r\n\"Walt!\" Chet was saying. \"For God's sake come out of it! Are you\r\ncrazy? You might have wrecked that door-port so we never could have\r\nfixed it; or the bullet could have gone on through to explode inside\r\nthe ship. Either way we would never get back: no leaky hull would ever\r\nlet us make the trip home!\"\r\n\r\nChet was right: Harkness knew it in a moment. He knew the folly of\r\nwhat he would have done, yet knew, too, that desperate measures were\r\nneeded and needed quickly. The eyes of a devil had held his own from\r\nthe darkness of the rocks, and the same rock wall came close to where\r\nthey stood. He was in command; it was up to him--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe moment of indecision ended as a mass of viscous fluid splashed\r\nheavily against the ship. Harkness whirled about to face the rocks. He\r\nwas calm now and controlled, but under his quiet courage was a fear\r\nthat gripped him. A fear of what he should find! But the reality was\r\nso far beyond any imagined terror as to leave him cold.\r\n\r\nAbove them and thirty feet away on a rocky ledge was a thing of\r\nhorror. Basilisk eyes in a hairy head; gray, stringy hairs; and the\r\nfearful head ended in narrow, outthrust jaws, where more of the gray\r\nhairs hung like moss from lips that writhed and curled and sucked at\r\nthe air with a whistling shrillness. Those jaws could crush a man to\r\npulp. And the head seemed huge until the body behind it came into\r\nview.\r\n\r\nThe suddenness with which the great body rose showed the strength of\r\nthe beast. A prodigious sack, like black leather, with markings of\r\ncrimson and copper!--and the straggling, ropy hairs on it were\r\ngreenish-gray like the lustre of the rocks at its back.\r\n\r\nIt stood upright on great hairy legs. The eyes shot forward on\r\nprotruding antennae. The sack-like body flexed to bring the rear part\r\nunder and forward. It was aiming at them.\r\n\r\nHarkness seized the slim figure of the girl who stood, mute with\r\nhorror, beside him. He threw her roughly to the ground, for the\r\nmeaning of the viscous splash was plain.\r\n\r\n\"Down!\" he shouted to Chet. \"Down on the ground!\" And he felt the\r\nswish of another liquid mass above his head as he obeyed his own\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nHe felt for his pistol, then remembered it was gone--lost when Chet\r\nsprang upon him. But Chet had his.\r\n\r\n\"Shoot!\" he ordered. \"Shoot the damned thing, Chet! Kill the spider!\"\r\n\r\nSpider! He had named it unconsciously. But the name was inadequate,\r\nfor here was a thing of horror beyond even a spider of prodigious\r\nsize. This peaceful valley!--and here was its ruler, frightful,\r\nincredibly loathsome!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe waited for the sound of a shot. A cursing, instead, was the only\r\nreply: Chet was not firing! Harkness whirled to see the pilot pinned\r\nby one arm to the web.\r\n\r\nThe fluid had caught him; he had not dropped quickly enough. And his\r\nright hand that had been raised, and the pistol it held, were clamped\r\nfast to the awful stuff.\r\n\r\nThere was no word of appeal, no call for help, yet Chet Bullard must\r\nhave known what this meant. But neither did Harkness wait for that\r\nword. One spring, and he had the pilot by the waist, and he felt the\r\nweight of the girl's slim body added to his as her arms went about him\r\nto help. Chet's face went chalk-white as the hand tore loose. The\r\npistol remained buried in the clinging stuff.\r\n\r\nFrom the corner of his eye, Harkness saw the monster crouched to\r\nspring. He was half dragging the other two as he stooped and ran for\r\nthe bow of the ship. The monstrous body thudded against the metal hull\r\nbehind them.\r\n\r\nThe leap was prodigious. He saw the sack-like body fall inert, the\r\ngreat, hairy legs shaking. For the moment, the attacker was helpless:\r\nbut the respite was brief, as the glaring eyes plainly told.\r\n\r\nBelow the ledge where the beast had been was an opening in the\r\nrocks--a bit of black shadow that was darker than the lustrous metal\r\nof the cliff. There was a chance--\r\n\r\n\"I can make it,\" Chet was saying, as Harkness dragged him on; \"help\r\nDiane!\" But the girl had sprung before them to gain a foothold and\r\nextend a helping hand. And they were back in the darkness of a rocky\r\ncave before the sunlit entrance was blocked by a hairy head and a\r\nhorrible, slavering mouth on a body too huge to enter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n_In the Labyrinth_\r\n\r\nSpent and shaken, the three passed onward into the cave. Harkness\r\nsearched his pockets for his neolite flash; found it--a tiny pencil\r\nwith a tip of glass--and the darkness of the inner cave was flooded\r\nwith light.\r\n\r\nA box of food tablets was in a pocket of Chet's jacket, and there was\r\nwater that trickled in a tiny stream out of the rocks. It could have\r\nbeen worse, Diane pointed out with forced gaiety. But Harkness, who\r\nhad gone back for a final look at the entrance to the cave, found it\r\ndifficult to smile.\r\n\r\nHe had found the entrance an opening no longer: it was sealed with a\r\ngiant web of ropy strands--a network, welded together to a glutinous\r\nmesh. They were sealed in as effectively as if the opening were\r\nclosed by a thick door of steel.\r\n\r\nThey gathered fungus that grew in thready clumps on the walls, and\r\nthis served as a mattress to soften the rocky floor that must be their\r\nbed. And Harkness sat silent in the darkness long after the others\r\nwere asleep--sat alone on guard, to think and to reach, at last, a\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nA cleavage in the rocks made a narrow crack to the outside world, and\r\nthrough it the starlight filtered dimly. The thread of light grew\r\nbrilliantly golden--moonlight, a hundredfold more bright than\r\nmoonlight on Earth. And he realized that the source of light was their\r\nown globe, Earth, shining far through space!\r\n\r\nIt lighted the cave with a mellow glow. It shone upon the closed eyes\r\nof the sleeping girl, and touched lightly upon the rounded softness of\r\na lovely face beneath a tangle of brown curls. Harkness stared long\r\nand soberly at the picture she made, and he thought of many things.\r\n\r\nNo parasite upon society was this girl. He had known such; but her\r\nready wit, her keen grasp of affairs, had been evident in their talks\r\non the journey they had made. They had stamped her as one who was able\r\nto share in the work and responsibilities of a world where men and\r\nwomen worked together. Yet there was nothing of the hardness that so\r\nmany women showed. And now she was altogether feminine, and entirely\r\nlovely.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNot far away, Chet Bullard was sleeping heavily. His hand, injured\r\npainfully when they tore it from the clinging mass, had been bandaged\r\nby Diane. It troubled him now, and he flung one arm outward. His hand\r\ntouched that of the girl, and Harkness saw the instant quiet that came\r\nupon him at the touch. And Diane--her lips were smiling in her sleep.\r\n\r\nThey had been much together, those two; theirs had been a ready,\r\nlaughing comradeship. It had troubled Harkness, but now he put all\r\nthought of self aside.\r\n\r\n\"This trip,\" he thought, \"can end only in disaster--if it has not\r\nalready done so. What a fool I was to bring these two!\" And: \"If I\r\nwant to risk my own life,\" he told himself bitterly, \"that's my own\r\naffair. But for Chet, and Diane, with their lives ahead of them--\" His\r\ndetermination was quickly reached.\r\n\r\nHe would go back. Somehow, some way, he would get them to the ship.\r\nThey would return to Earth. And then.... His plans were vague. But he\r\nknew he could interest capital; he knew that this new world, that was\r\none great mine of raw metals, would not go long unworked. The metallic\r\ncolorations in rock walls and mountains had fairly shouted of rich\r\nores and untold wealth.\r\n\r\nYes, they would go back, but he would return. He would put from his\r\nmind all thought of this girl; he would forget forever those nebulous\r\nplans that had filled him with hope for a happiness beyond all hoping.\r\nAnd he would come back here prepared for conquest.\r\n\r\nHe put aside all speculation as to what other horrible forms of life\r\nthe little world might hold: he would be prepared to deal with them.\r\nBut he still wondered if there were people. He had hoped to find some\r\nhuman life.\r\n\r\nAnd this hope, too, left him; his sense of this globe as an\r\nundeveloped world was strong upon him. The monsters; the tropical,\r\nterrible vegetation; the very air itself--all breathed of a world that\r\nwas young. There had not been time for the long periods of evolution\r\nthrough which humanity came.\r\n\r\nHe tried to tell himself of the wealth that would be his; tried to\r\nfeel the excitement that should follow upon such plans. But he could\r\nonly feel a sense of loss, of something precious that was gone.\r\nDiane--named for the moon: she seemed more precious now to the lonely\r\nman than all else on moon or Earth. She could never be his; she never\r\nhad been. It was Chet upon whom the gods and Diane had smiled. And\r\nChet deserved it.\r\n\r\nOnly in this last conviction did he find some measure of consolation\r\nduring the long night.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"We will rip the big web out with detonite,\" Harkness told the others\r\nwhen morning came. \"But I want to get the spider, too.\"\r\n\r\nA touch upon the web with a stick brought an instant response. Again\r\nthey saw in all its repulsiveness the thing that seemed a creature of\r\nsome horrible dream. The eyes glared, while hairy feelers seized the\r\nweb and shook it in furious rage. Harkness, fearing another discharge\r\nof the nauseating, viscous liquid, withdrew with the others far back\r\nin the cave.\r\n\r\n\"Wait,\" he told them. \"I have a plan.\"\r\n\r\nThe creature vanished, and Harkness went cautiously forward to the\r\nweb. He took a detonite cartridge from his belt and placed it on the\r\nfloor close to the ropy strands. Another, and another, until he had a\r\nclose-packed circle of the deadly things. Then he placed a heavy,\r\nmetallic piece of rock beside them and proceeded, with infinite care,\r\nto build a tower.\r\n\r\nOne irregular block upon another: it was like a child at play with his\r\ntoys. Only now the play was filled with deadly menace. The stones\r\nswayed, then held in precarious, leaning uncertainty; the topmost was\r\ndirectly above the cartridges on the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Back!\" he ordered the others, \"and lie flat on the floor. I must\r\nguess at the amount of explosive for the job.\"\r\n\r\nChet and Diane were safe as Harkness weighed a fragment of metal in\r\nhis hand. One throw--and he must not hit the tower he had built....\r\nThe rock struck into the network of cords; he saw it clinging where it\r\nstruck, and saw the web shaking with the blow.\r\n\r\nOver his shoulder, as he ran, he glimpsed the onrush of the beast.\r\nAgain the eyes were glaring, again the feelers were shaking furiously\r\nat the web. They touched the leaning stones!\r\n\r\nHe had reached the place where Chet and Diane lay and saw the\r\nbeginning of the tower's fall; and in the split second of its falling\r\nhe threw himself across the body of the prostrate girl to shield her\r\nfrom flying fragments of stone. A blast of air tore at him; his ears\r\nwere numbed with the thunder of the blast--a thunder that ended with a\r\ncrashing of stone on stone....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSlowly he recovered his breath; then raised himself to his feet to\r\nlook toward the entrance. It would be open now, the way cleared. But,\r\ninstead of sunlight, he saw utter dark. Where the mouth of the cave\r\nhad been was blackness--and nothing else!\r\n\r\nHe fumbled for his flash, and stood in despairing silence before what\r\nthe light disclosed.\r\n\r\nThe rock was black and shining about the mouth of the cavern. It had\r\nsplit like glass. In shattered fragments it filled the forward part of\r\nthe cave. The whole roof must have fallen, and a crashing slide above\r\nhad covered all.\r\n\r\nChet was beside him; Harkness dared not look toward the girl coming\r\nexpectantly forward.\r\n\r\n\"We'll use more of the same,\" Chet suggested: \"we will blast our way\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\n\"And bring down more rock with each charge,\" Harkness told him\r\ntonelessly. \"This means we are--\"\r\n\r\nDiane had overheard. Harkness' pause had come too late.\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" she encouraged. \"This means we are entombed?--buried here? Is\r\nthat it?\"\r\n\r\nHer voice was quiet; her eyes, in the light of the little flash, were\r\nsteady in their look upon the man who was leader of the expedition.\r\nDiane Vernier might shudder with horror before some obscene beast--she\r\nwould tremble with delight, too, at sight of some sudden beauty--but\r\nshe was not one to give way to hysteria when a situation must be\r\nfaced. No despair could be long-lived under the spell of those eyes,\r\nbrave and encouraging.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Walter Harkness: \"we will find some way to escape. This is\r\nblocked. We will follow the cave back and see where it leads. There\r\nmust be other outlets. We're not quitting now.\" He smiled with a\r\ncheerful confidence that gave no hint of being assumed, and he led the\r\nway with a firm step.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDiane followed as usual, close to Chet. But her eyes were upon their\r\nleader; they would have repaid him for a backward look.\r\n\r\nTo a mineralogist this tunnel that nature had pierced through the rock\r\nwould have been an endless delight, but to a man seeking escape from\r\nhis living tomb it brought no such ecstasy. The steady, appraising\r\nglance of Harkness was everywhere--darting ahead, examining the walls,\r\nseeking some indication, some familiar geological structure, that\r\nmight be of help.\r\n\r\nHe stopped once to kick contemptuously at a vein of quartz. Three feet\r\nin thickness--and it crumbled to fragments under his foot to release a\r\nnetwork of gold.\r\n\r\n\"Rotten with it,\" he said.\r\n\r\nAnd the only comment came from Chet: \"A fat lot of good it does us!\"\r\nhe replied.\r\n\r\nThe cavern branched and branched again; it opened to a great room\r\nhigher than their light could reach; it narrowed to leave apertures\r\nthrough which they crawled like moles; it became a labyrinth of\r\npassages from which there seemed no escape. Each turn, each new\r\nopening, large or small--it was always the same: Harkness praying\r\ninaudibly for a glimpse of light that would mean day; and,\r\ninstead--darkness!--and their own pencil of light so feeble against\r\nthe gloom ahead....\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n_The Half-Men_\r\n\r\n\"The Valley of the Fires,\" Harkness was to call it later, and shorten\r\nit again to \"Fire Valley.\" The misty smokes of a thousand fires rose\r\nskyward from the lava beds of its upper end.\r\n\r\nWhere the lava flow had stopped and the lower valley began, came\r\nvegetation. Sparse at first, then springing to luxuriant growth, it\r\ncontrasted strongly with the barren wall beside it and the equally\r\nbarren waste of high ground where the fires were.\r\n\r\nMountains hemmed it in; their distant peaks showed black, with red and\r\ngreen striations of mineralized deposits. The valleys about them were\r\ndense with foliage, a green so startling and vivid as almost to offend\r\nthe eye.\r\n\r\nTrees were in the lower end of the valley. They were of tremendous\r\ngrowth, and the dew of early morning dripped from them like rain.\r\nTrunks smooth and ghostly white, except where the bark had split into\r\ncountless fractures and the scarlet color of the sap-wood showed\r\nthrough. Outflung branches forked to drop down dangling stalks that\r\nrooted again in the ground; these made a forest of slender white\r\nsupports for the leafy roof--a forest of spectral shapes in a\r\nshadow-world. Only here and there were arrows of sunlight that\r\npierced the dense foliage above to strike through and down to the\r\nblack earth floor and the carpet of rainbow hues.\r\n\r\nAnd that carpet of radiant colors was trampled into paths that wound\r\non to lose themselves in the half-light of that ghostly world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom one of the paths came sounds of tramping feet. Cries and snarling\r\ngrunts resounded through the silence to send lizards scurrying to the\r\nsafety of the trees. Animal cries or hoarse voices of men--it would\r\nhave been difficult to tell which. And a sight of the creatures\r\nthemselves would have left an observer still in doubt.\r\n\r\nA score of them, and they walked upright. Some bodies were naked, a\r\ncoppery-black in color; on others the skin was covered by a sparse\r\ngrowth of hair. Noses that were mere nostril-slits; low foreheads,\r\nretreating flatly to a tangle of matted hair; protruding jaws which\r\nshowed the white flash of canine teeth as the ape-like faces twisted\r\nand the creatures tugged at ropes of vines thrown over their\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nThe Neanderthal Man had not learned to use the wheel; and these\r\nman-animals, too, used only the sheer strength of their corded muscles\r\nas they hauled at the body of a beast.\r\n\r\nIt dragged along the path behind them, rolling at times to show the\r\nwhite of its belly instead of the flexible armor-plating that\r\nprotected its back. Fresh blood flowed from a wound in the white\r\nunder-skin; this, and the dripping flints that tipped their spears,\r\ntold how death had come. One curving horn that projected from a\r\nwrinkled snout caught at times in the undergrowth, and then the ones\r\nwho dragged it would throw themselves upon the head with snarls of\r\nfury and twist the big horn free.\r\n\r\nThe rocky cliff was honeycombed with caves. A cry, half-human in its\r\ntone, brought an avalanche of figures scurrying forth. Children, whose\r\ndistended abdomens told of the alternate feasting and hunger that was\r\ntheirs, were cuffed aside by women who shouted shrilly at sight of the\r\nprize. Older men came, too, and in a screaming mob they threw\r\nthemselves upon the carcass of the beast that had been dragged into\r\nthe open.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFlint knives came into play, then sharpened stakes that were thrust\r\nthrough the bleeding meat. Young and old seized what they could,\r\nleaped across the little stream that trickled downward through the\r\nvalley, and raced for the nearest fires.\r\n\r\nThe fumaroles made places for roasting, and these half-men had learned\r\nthe taste of cooked meats. Their jaws were slavering as they waited.\r\nThe scents were tantalizing.\r\n\r\nA hunter was reaching to snatch a shred of half-cooked meat when a\r\nwoman of the tribe gave a scream that was shrill with fear. She\r\npointed her gnarled hand upward on the face of the cliff.\r\n\r\nAn opening was there, a black cave-mouth in the black cliff. Above\r\ntheir own caves, was this higher opening, yet they must have explored\r\nit often--must have followed it as far as they dared, where it led to\r\nthe mountain's innermost depths. Yet from this familiar place there\r\nstepped forth an apparition. Another followed, and another--three\r\nstrange creatures like none the savage eyes of this world had ever\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nClothing torn to rags--faces black and smeared with blood--hands that\r\nreached groping and trembling toward the light, until the half-blinded\r\neyes of one saw the trickling brook.\r\n\r\nThen, \"Water!\" he croaked in a voice hardly more human than the\r\ngrunts of horror from below, and he took the hand of another to help\r\nin the steep descent--while the tribe beneath them forgot their\r\nanticipated feast, forgot all but their primordial fear of the\r\nunknown, and, with startled cries, broke and ran for the safety of the\r\nforest....\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n_The Throwers of Thunder_\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if Walter Harkness heard or consciously saw that\r\nfleeing tribe. He saw only the glorious sunlight and its sparkling\r\nreflection upon the stream; and in his nostrils was the scent of\r\nroasting meat to rouse him to a frenzy.\r\n\r\nFor seven Earth days he and Chet had kept account of the hours. How\r\nlong after that they had followed their stumbling course he could not\r\nhave told. Time ceased to be measured in hours and days; rather was it\r\nreckoned in painful progress a foot at a time up rocky burrows,\r\nhelping, both of them, to ease the path for the girl who struggled so\r\nbravely with them, until aching muscles refused to bear them further.\r\nThen periods of drugged sleep with utter fatigue for an opiate--and on\r\nagain in hopeless, aimless wandering.\r\n\r\nAnd now, the sun! And he was plunging his head into icy water to drink\r\nuntil he strangled for breath! He knew that Chet and Diane were beside\r\nhim. A weak laugh came to his lips as he sat erect: the girl had drunk\r\nas deeply as the rest--and now she was washing her hands and face.\r\n\r\nThe idea seemed tremendously amusing--or was it that the simple rite\r\nindicated more than he could bear to know? It meant that they were\r\nsafe; they had escaped; and again a trifle like cleanliness was\r\nimportant in a woman's eyes. He rocked with meaningless\r\nlaughter--until again a puff of wind brought distinctly the odor of\r\ncooking food.\r\n\r\nA hundred feet away, up higher in the valley, were the first of the\r\nfires. Harkness came to his feet and ran--ran staggeringly, it is\r\ntrue, but he ran--and he tore at some hanging shreds of smoking meat\r\nregardless of the burn. But the fierce gnawing at his stomach did not\r\nforce him to wolf the food. He carried it back, a double handful of\r\nhalf-cooked meat, to the others. And he doled it out sparingly to them\r\nand to himself.\r\n\r\nThe cold water had restored his sanity. \"Easy,\" he advised them; \"too\r\nmuch at first and we're done for.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was chewing on the last shred when a thought struck him; he had\r\nbeen too stunned before to reason. For the first time he jerked up his\r\nhead in startled alarm. He looked carefully about--at the meat on its\r\npointed stakes, at the distant fires, at the open glade below them and\r\nthe dense jungle beyond where nothing stirred.\r\n\r\n\"Cooked meat!\" he exclaimed in a whisper. \"Who did it? This means\r\npeople!\"\r\n\r\nThe memory that had registered only in some corner of a mind deeper\r\nthan the conscious, came to the surface. \"I remember,\" he said. \"There\r\nwere things that ran--men--apes--what were they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Lord!\" Chet groaned. \"And all I ask is to be left alone!\" But he\r\nwearily raised himself upright and verified the other's words.\r\n\r\n\"They ran toward that opening among those trees. And I'll bet they\r\nlive in these caves up here behind us. I got a whiff of them as we\r\ncame past: they smelled like a zoo.\"\r\n\r\nThey had come out on top of the lava-flow, close to its end. The\r\nmolten rock had hardened to leave a drop of some forty feet to the\r\nopen glade below. Beyond that the jungle began, but behind them was\r\nthe lava bed, frozen in countless corrugations. Harkness rose and\r\nhelped Diane to her feet: they must force their aching muscles to take\r\nup their task again.\r\n\r\nHe peered up the valley where a thousand fires smoked. \"That stream,\"\r\nhe said, \"comes in from a little valley that branches off up there. We\r\nhad better follow it--and we had better get going before that gang\r\nrecovers from its surprise.\"\r\n\r\nThey were passing the first of the fires where the meat was smoking\r\nwhen Chet called a halt. \"Wait a bit,\" he begged: \"let's take a\r\nsirloin steak along--\" He was haggling at a chunk of meat with a\r\nbroken flint when a spear whistled in and crashed upon the rocks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHarkness saw the thrower. Beyond the lava's edge the jungle could be\r\nseen, and from among the spectral trees had darted a wild figure whose\r\nhairy arm had snapped the spear into the air.\r\n\r\nThere were more who followed. They were sliding down the slender\r\ntrunks that supported the branches and leafy roof high above the\r\nground. To Harkness the open doorway to the jungle seemed swarming\r\nwith monkey-men. The movement of the three fugitives had been taken as\r\na retreat, and the courage of the cave-dwellers had returned.\r\n\r\nHarkness glanced quickly about to size up their situation. To go on\r\nwas certain death; if these creatures came up to meet them on the\r\nlava-beds, the end was sure. The escarpment gave the three some slight\r\nadvantage of a higher position.\r\n\r\nOne vain wish for the pistol now resting in the deep grass beside a\r\nvanished ship; then he sprang for the weapon that had been thrown--it\r\nwas better than nothing--and advanced cautiously to the lava's edge.\r\n\r\nNo concealment there; no broken rocks, other than pieces of flint; a\r\npoor fortress, this, that they must defend! And the weapons of their\r\ncivilization were denied them.\r\n\r\nAnother spear hummed its shrill song, coming dangerously close. He saw\r\nwomen-figures that came from the jungle with supplies of weapons.\r\nShort spears, about six feet long, like the one he held. But they had\r\nothers, too--long lances of slender wood with tips of flint. Thrusting\r\nspears! He had a sickening vision of those jagged stone heads ripping\r\ninto their bodies while these beasts stood off in safety. It was thus\r\nthat they killed their prey. And Diane--he could not even spare\r\nher--could not give her the kind oblivion of a mercy-shot!\r\n\r\nThe other two were lying beside him now at the edge of the sloping\r\ncliff. The bank of shining gray was not steep; the enemy would climb\r\nit with ease. Hopeless! They had won through for this!... Harkness\r\ngroaned silently in an agony of spirit at thought of the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, for one detonite shell to land among them!\" he said between\r\nclenched teeth--then was breathless with a thought that exploded\r\nwithin his mind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis fingers were clumsy with haste as he fumbled at the head of the\r\nspear. The sharp-edged stone was bound to its shaft with sinew, wound\r\nround and round. The enemy were out in the open; he spared an\r\ninstant's look to see them advancing. A clattering of falling spears\r\nsounded beyond, but the weapons were overcast, thanks to the\r\nprotection of the rocky edge.\r\n\r\n\"A shell!\" Harkness spoke with sharp intensity. \"Give me a cartridge\r\nfrom your belt, quick!\"\r\n\r\nChet handed him one. Harkness took one look, then pulled a cartridge\r\nfrom his own belt.\r\n\r\n\"That explains it,\" he was muttering as he worked, \"--the big\r\nexplosion when I smashed the rocks. You've got ammunition for your\r\npistol, but you put rifle cartridges in my belt--and service\r\nammunition at that. No wonder they raised the devil with those rocks!\"\r\n\r\nHis fingers were working swiftly now to bind the slender cartridge to\r\nthe spear. A chipped out hollow in the flint made a seat. He gave\r\nsilent thanks for Chet Bullard's mistake. Chet had slipped; he had\r\nfilled Harkness' belt with ammunition that would have been useless for\r\nthe pistol--but it was just what he needed here.\r\n\r\nSo intent was he on his task that he hardly heard the yelling chorus\r\nfrom below. It swelled to a din; but his work was finished, and he\r\nlooked up.\r\n\r\nOne figure in advance of the rest had been urging them on, and they\r\ncame in a wild rush now. Walt Harkness scrambled to his feet. Tall and\r\nsinewy, his broad shoulders, scantily covered by the rags of blouse\r\nthat remained, were turned sideways as he raised the spear. The\r\nyelling from below swelled louder and more shrill.\r\n\r\nThis strange one from another tribe--he was unarmed except for one of\r\ntheir own spears. The curious covering on his body was flapping in the\r\nbreeze. Nothing here, surely, to hold a hunting-tribe in check.\r\n\r\nThe spear rose slowly in the air. What child of the tribe could not\r\nhave thrown it better! They came on faster now; the leader had almost\r\nreached the place where the spear was dropping down. He must have\r\nlaughed, if laughter had yet been born in such a breast, at the futile\r\nweapon dropping point first among the rocks.\r\n\r\nOne little shell, a scant three inches long, no thicker than the\r\nstylus on milady's desk! But here was service ammunition, as Harkness\r\nhad said; and in the end of the lead a fulminate cap was buried--and a\r\ngrain of dense, gray dust!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was no flame--only a concussion that cracked upon one's ears,\r\nand flying rock fragments that filled the air with demoniac shrieks.\r\nAnd then that sound was lost in the shriller cries of terror and pain\r\nas the ape-men broke for the trees.\r\n\r\nHarkness saw some of them who rose and fell again to rise no more, and\r\none who dragged himself slowly from the blast that had struck him\r\ndown. But his eyes came back to another spear in his hands, and his\r\nfingers were tearing at the sinew wrapping.\r\n\r\nThe spear bent in his hands; the wood was flexible and springy. It was\r\nDiane who offered the next suggestion. She, too, was working at\r\nanother spear--what wonder if her breath came fast!--but her eyes were\r\nalight, and her mind was at work.\r\n\r\n\"Make a bow!\" she exclaimed. \"A bow and arrow, Walter! We are fighting\r\nprimitive men, so we can't scorn primitive weapons.\" She stopped with\r\na little exclamation of pain; the sharp tip of the flint had cut her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nChet's spearhead was unloosed. He tried the spring of the shaft.\r\n\"Bully girl, Diane!\" he said, and fell to gouging out a notch with the\r\nsharp flint near the end of the shaft.\r\n\r\nThe sinew made a string. Three slender sticks lying about whose ends\r\nhad been sharpened for use on the meat: they would do for arrows. Each\r\narrow must be notched and headed with an explosive shell, and there\r\nwere many of them.\r\n\r\nChet sprang to his feet at last. Forgotten was the fatigue that had\r\nnumbed him. A wild figure, his clothes in rags, his short, curling\r\nhair no longer blond, his face a mottling of brown and black, where\r\nonly here and there the white skin dared show through--he executed an\r\nintricate dance-step with a bed of lava for a floor, while he\r\nshouted:\r\n\r\n\"Bring on your fighters! Bring 'em on! Who's going to stop us now?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey were free to go, but Harkness paused at a renewed screaming from\r\nthe jungle. Again the hairy ones poured forth into the open glade. He\r\nhad half raised his bow, with arrow ready, before he saw that this was\r\nno attack.\r\n\r\nThe screams merged discordantly with other sounds--a crashing of\r\nuprooted trees--a chorus of harsh coughing--snorting--unrecognizable\r\nnoises. And the people were cowering in terror.\r\n\r\nThey half-ran toward the safety of their caves, but the throwers of\r\nthunder, the demons on the lava bed, were between them and their\r\nhomes. They turned to face the jungle, and the wild sounds and crash\r\nof splintered wood that drew near.\r\n\r\nHarkness saw the first head that appeared. He stared in open-mouthed\r\namazement at the armored monster. Thick plates of shell covered its\r\nmammoth body and lapped part way over the head to end at beady,\r\nwicked, red eyes on either side of a single curved horn.\r\n\r\nAn instant the animal waited, to glare at the cowering human forms it\r\nhad tracked to their lair; others crashed through beside it; and in\r\nthat instant Harkness recognized the huddled group below as brothers.\r\nFar down they were, in the long, weary path that was evolution, and\r\nhardly come as yet to a consciousness of self--but there were those\r\nwho leaped before the others, their long spears couched and ready;\r\nthey were defending the weaker ones at their backs; they were men!\r\n\r\nAnd Harkness was shouting as he raised his crude bow. \"Shoot!\" he\r\nordered. \"Kill the brutes!\" His own arrow was speeding true.\r\n\r\nThe rush of mammoth beasts was on as he fired, but it was checked as\r\nquickly as it began. An inferno of explosions rose about the rushing\r\nbodies; crashing detonations struck two of them down, their heads torn\r\nand crushed. Between the helpless, primordial men and the charging\r\nbeasts was a geyser of spouting earth and rocks, through which showed\r\nugly heads and tremendous bodies that wheeled and crashed madly back\r\ninto the jungle growth.\r\n\r\nHarkness suddenly realized that only he and Chet had fired. Diane's\r\nbow was on the ground. He saw the girl beside it, sitting upright; but\r\nher body was trembling and weaving, and she was plainly maintaining\r\nher upright posture only by the greatest effort.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was beside her in an instant. \"What is it?\" he demanded. \"Are you\r\nhurt? What is it?\"\r\n\r\nShe raised her hand that he might see; her lips, seemed almost too\r\nnumb for speech.\r\n\r\n\"Only a scratch,\" she whispered, but Harkness saw her eyes glazing. He\r\ndropped to his knees and caught her swaying body in his arms.\r\n\r\n\"A scratch,\" she repeated in a fading voice, \"from the spear....\r\nPoison ... I think.\"\r\n\r\nA head appeared over the lava crest. Harkness saw it vaguely. He knew\r\nthat Chet had the newcomer covered; his bow was drawn. It meant\r\nnothing to him, for Diane was wounded--dying! Dying, now, in his\r\narms....\r\n\r\nThe ape-man came on; he was grovelling upon the ground. He was\r\nhairless, like the one they had seen escape the attack of the giant\r\nbat, and his cheek was slashed with a healing cut that might have been\r\nmade by a ripping talon. He abased himself before the awful might of\r\nthese creatures who had saved them. And he made motions with his arms\r\nto picture how they had sailed down from the skies; had landed; and he\r\nhad seen them. He was plainly petitioning for pardon and the favor of\r\nthese gods--when he dropped his animal head to stare at the girl and\r\nthe cut hand that Harkness held in his.\r\n\r\nThe blue discoloration of the wound must have been plain in its\r\nsignificance. The hairless one sprang abruptly to his feet and darted\r\ntoward a cave. He was back in a moment; and, though be approached with\r\nwriggling humility, he reached the girl and he ventured to touch the\r\ndiscolored hand with a sticky paste. He had a gourd that he held to\r\nthe girl's lips.\r\n\r\nHarkness would have struck it away; he was beside himself with grief.\r\nBut Chet interposed.\r\n\r\n\"Give it to her,\" he said in a sharp, strained voice that told of his\r\nown dismay. \"I think the beggar knows what he's about. He is trying to\r\nhelp.\"\r\n\r\nThe lips were lax; only a little of the liquid found its way down her\r\nthroat. But Harkness, after minutes of agony, saw the first flutter of\r\nlids that betokened returning life....\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\"_But Awfully Dumb...._\"\r\n\r\nHarkness would never forget the helpless body in his arms, nor the\r\ntender look that came slowly to the opened eyes that gazed so steadily\r\ninto his. And yet it was Chet that she seemed to want for the thousand\r\nlittle services during the week that followed. And Harkness tried to\r\nstill the hurt in his heart, and he told himself that it was her\r\nhappiness be wanted more than his; that if she found greater pleasure\r\nin having Chet near, then his love was unworthy if it placed itself as\r\na bar to that other happiness.\r\n\r\nHe talked by signs with the hairless one whom he called Towahg. It was\r\nthe sound the other made as he struck upon his chest. And he learned\r\nthat Towahg could guide him to the ship.\r\n\r\nThe tribe had left them alone. Only Towahg seemed inclined to\r\nfriendliness; and Harkness frequently saw the one who was their leader\r\nin ugly, silent contemplation of them when Towahg brought food and\r\nwater to their cave.\r\n\r\nDiane was recovering, but her progress was slow. She was able at once\r\nto walk and go slowly about, but the least exertion tired her. It had\r\nbeen a close call, Harkness knew, and he realized that some time must\r\npass before she could take up the hardships of the trail. And in the\r\nmeantime much might happen.\r\n\r\nHe felt that he must reach the ship at the first possible moment and\r\nreturn for the others; Towahg would show him the way. He explained the\r\nplan to Chet and Diane only to meet with emphatic dissent.\r\n\r\n\"You would go alone?\" the girl exclaimed. \"To meet heaven knows what\r\ndangers? No, no, Walter; you must not! Wait; I am stronger; I can go\r\nsoon, I know.\"\r\n\r\nChet, too, was for delay--Diane was better, and she would improve\r\nsteadily. They could carry her, at first. But Harkness looked at the\r\njungle he must penetrate and knew that he was right.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe gave Towahg a bow and arrows like his own and those that Chet kept\r\nfor defense, but the arrows were of sharpened wood without detonite\r\ntips. He grinned toward Chet as he showed the savage how to handle the\r\nmarvellous thing.\r\n\r\n\"We've advanced these people a thousand years in the science of arms,\"\r\nhe said. \"They should make Diane their first Minister of Munitions, or\r\nworship her as their own lovely goddess of the chase.\"\r\n\r\nA weapon that would throw farther than the strongest man could cast a\r\nspear--here was magic indeed! And Towahg knelt and grovelled on the\r\nground at his benefactor's feet.\r\n\r\nHarkness made light of the dangers he must face, but he knew in his\r\nown mind he might fail. And the time of leaving found him curiously\r\ndepressed. He had gripped Chet's hand, then turned to Diane for what\r\nmight be a last good-by. The quick enfoldment of her soft body in his\r\narms was as unpremeditated as the kiss he placed upon her lips.... He\r\nswung away abruptly, and fell in behind his guide without a word. The\r\nway led first across the place of smoke and fire.\r\n\r\nDanger ahead on this strange trail; he knew it well. But he took it as\r\nit came; and his guide, and his crude weapon, and his steady eye and\r\nsureness of foot on rocky crags all saw him through. And he mentally\r\nmapped the hills and valleys and the outcrops of metals that he would\r\nexplore some later time. Only seven of the short six-hour days of this\r\nlittle earth had passed when he drew near the ship.\r\n\r\nHe was ready for an attack. There was the broken rubble that marked\r\nthe entrance of the cave. Beneath it, he knew, were mangled, horrible\r\nremains. This one beast alone, it seemed, had been the ruler of the\r\nvalley, for no other appeared.\r\n\r\nThe mass that had blocked the doorway was crystalline now, and broke\r\nto brittle fragments at a blow. He entered the familiar cabin of the\r\nship. There was nothing disturbed; the sealed inner door had barred\r\nentrance to any inquiring beasts.\r\n\r\nFar down the valley he saw a naked, running figure. Towahg had\r\nescorted this sky-god to the great bird that had brought him, but the\r\ncourage of even so advanced a tribesman as he must have limits. He was\r\nstill running along the path they had come when Harkness closed and\r\nsealed the door.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was an instrument among their stores for taking samples of gas.\r\nHarkness attached it to the ship before he left, and he took a few\r\nprecious minutes for a flight into the heights. That gas up there was\r\nfatal to the monsters of space: he must secure a sample and learn its\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nA closing of the switch on wires that led to the instrument outside,\r\nand he knew that the container had emptied its contents of water,\r\ndrawn in the gas and sealed itself.\r\n\r\nThen the swift descent.\r\n\r\nHe flew low as he circled back. They had traveled far on their journey\r\nbelow ground; it was even a longer route where he and Towahg had\r\ncircled about. But it was the only route he knew; he could take no\r\nchances on a short-cut and a possible long-drawn search for the little\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nHe followed the trail. The quick dusk was near; but in an hour's slow\r\nflying, while his eyes searched the hills and hollows, the valley was\r\nin sight.\r\n\r\nHe came down slowly in a black sky, with only the soft, muffled roar\r\nof the lower exhausts. It was growing dark, and he leaned from an open\r\ndoor to see more clearly his position. All was different from the air,\r\nand he needed time and careful scrutiny to get the bearings of the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe soft thunder from below was in his ears when a sound pierced\r\nthrough. His own name! And it was Diane's voice calling him in a\r\nterrified tone.\r\n\r\n\"Walter!\" she cried. \"Help! Help! Oh, Walter, come quickly!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe scene below was lighted by fitful fires. He was above the upper\r\nvalley, a hundred yards from their cave: his mind was oriented in an\r\ninstant, and he knew each foot of ground.\r\n\r\nAnd here, where neither Diane nor Chet should be, was Diane. He saw\r\nher running in the bright glare of his landing light that he now\r\nswitched on; saw a black shape hurl itself upon her; she was\r\nstruggling. He threw himself back at the controls to send the ship\r\nlike a thunderbolt upon the earth.\r\n\r\nA pistol was in his hand as he leaped from the still-rocking ship and\r\nthrew himself upon the thing that ran and tried to carry a struggling\r\nburden in its arms.\r\n\r\nHe could not fire; but he brought the pistol down upon a heavy skull.\r\nThe hairy figure seemed never to feel the blow. It dropped the body of\r\nDiane and turned, and its slavering, shining fangs were set in a\r\nhorrible face that Harkness recognized.\r\n\r\nIt was the leader of the tribe, and he had dared to attack. But where\r\nwas Chet? What of his arrows and their detonite tips? These thoughts\r\nwere crowding through his mind in the instant that ape-like fingers\r\ngripped at his throat--the instant while he was bringing the pistol\r\nforward and up.\r\n\r\nA light charge of detonite in pistol ammunition--but no living body\r\ncould withstand the shock. Harkness leaped over the fallen foe to\r\nreach the girl. She was half risen to a sitting posture as he came.\r\n\r\n\"_Dieu!_\" she was whispering; \"_Ah, le bon Dieu!_\" Then she cried out:\r\n\"Walter! Oh, Walter, they have killed Chet! Down there!\" Her hand was\r\npointing. She grasped at Harkness' hand to draw herself to her feet\r\nand race with him toward the cave.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Just at dark,\" she explained gaspingly as they ran. \"It was their\r\nchief, and there were others with him. They leaped upon Chet--before\r\nhe could reach for his bow. They had seemed so friendly after you\r\nleft--but they were short of food--\"\r\n\r\nHer voice was sobbing now, but she kept on, and she set a pace that\r\nHarkness could not outdistance.\r\n\r\n\"One aimed a spear at me, and Chet threw himself between. I saw the\r\nspear strike--then I ran. I thought I heard your motors--I screamed\r\nfor you--\"\r\n\r\nThey were nearing the caves. A fire was burning in the open glade\r\nwhere grotesque figures leaped and danced in cannibal glee about a\r\nfigure that lay motionless upon the ground.\r\n\r\nThe tattered, wind-blown clothing--the curling hair, blond in the\r\nfire's light--it was Chet.... And now Harkness could fire.\r\n\r\nHis pistol held twenty rounds. He emptied it into the shrieking group,\r\nthen jammed in more of the shells and fired again. He fired until no\r\ntarget remained, and every savage figure was either vanished among the\r\ntrees or inert and lifeless upon the ground, their only motion the\r\nstirring of their hairy coverings in the breeze.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHarkness was beside the prostrate figure. He raised Chet's head within\r\nhis arms; Diane's brown head leaned close, her gasping breath broken\r\nby dry sobs. The firelight flickered upon the closed lids to give them\r\nsemblance of life.\r\n\r\n\"Chet,\" said Walter Harkness softly. \"Chet, old man--can't you speak?\r\nWe'll save you, Chet; you're not done for yet.\" But he felt as he\r\nspoke that the words were a horrible lie; the blood that ran slowly\r\nnow from a wound in Chet's side seemed to speak more truly than did\r\nhe.\r\n\r\nYet Chet Bullard opened his eyes. His breath was the merest flutter;\r\nthe listeners bent their heads close to hear.\r\n\r\n\"Made it, did you?\" asked Chet in a ghastly whisper. \"And you've saved\r\nDiane?... Good!... Well, it's been a great trip.... It's been worth\r\nthe price....\"\r\n\r\nHarkness seized at the girl's name. Here was something that might\r\nstrike home to the sinking man; might rouse him.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Diane is saved,\" he told Chet: \"saved for you, old fellow. You\r\nmust live--for Diane's sake. You love her, and she needs you.\"\r\n\r\nAgain the tired eyes opened. Once more the fluttering breath formed\r\nwords; lips moved to bring a pale ghost of Chet's ready smile like a\r\npassing light across his face.\r\n\r\n\"Needs me? Diane?\" It was a question and a denial. He was looking\r\nstraight at Harkness as he added: \"It's you she needs.... You're one\r\nsquare old sport, Walt, but dumb--awfully dumb....\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGlorious adventure!--and the price is so often death. \"A great trip,\"\r\nChet Bullard had said; \"it's been worth the price.\" Chet was prepared\r\nto pay in full.\r\n\r\nBut--there was the ship! Walt Harkness, as she finished bandaging the\r\nbody of the unconscious man, stared first at the metal cylinder,\r\ngleaming, brilliant in the Earthlight; then his gaze went to the Earth\r\nthat had risen over distant peaks with the glory of a thousand moons.\r\nAnd he dared to hope.\r\n\r\nHe brought the ship softly to rest close to where Chet lay, then\r\nplaced the limp form on the self-adjusting floor of the control room.\r\nThere must be no shifting of the body as the pull of gravitation\r\nceased. Soft blankets made a resting place for him.\r\n\r\nThe entrance port was closed and sealed; and the ship rose gently\r\nunder his touch. And, below them, the mirrors showed a world that sank\r\naway. Diane's head was pressed near to his to watch that vanishing\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nEach rugged mountain was softened in the Earthlight's mellow glow;\r\nthey melted together, and lost all sharpness of form. And the light\r\nfaded and vanished as they rose into the blanket of gas that blocked\r\noff the return rays and made of this world a dark moon.\r\n\r\nNo regret now for the territory that was unexplored. Harkness told\r\nhimself he would return. And, with the vanishing of that world his\r\nthoughts were only of the little flame of life that still flickered in\r\nChet's body, and of the Earth, and of the metal ball that was swinging\r\nthem out and away.... The sound of the stern exhaust built up and up\r\nto the roaring thunder that meant the blast was opened full....\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\"_Nothing to Be Done_\"\r\n\r\nUnmoving, their ship seemed, through the long hours. Yet there were\r\nlights that passed swiftly and unnoticed, and the unending thunder\r\nfrom the stern gave assurance that they were not floating idly in the\r\nvast sea of space.\r\n\r\nThe sun was behind them, and ahead was Earth in midday glory; Harkness\r\ncould not tear his eyes away from that goal. He stood always at the\r\ncontrols, not because there was work to be done, but for the feeling\r\nit gave him of urging the ship onward.\r\n\r\nDiane ministered to Chet and dressed the wound. There were few words\r\nexchanged between them.\r\n\r\nThe menace that had emptied Earth's higher levels of all aircraft was\r\nstill there. No ships were in sight, as Harkness guided his ship\r\ntoward the great sphere. His speed had been cut down, yet still he\r\noutraced the occasional, luminous, writhing forms that threw\r\nthemselves upon them. Then the repelling area--and he crashed silently\r\nthrough and down, with their forward exhaust roaring madly to hold\r\nthem in check.\r\n\r\nA sea and a shoreline, where a peninsula projected like a giant\r\nboot--and he knew it for Italy and the waters of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n\"Vienna,\" Diane was telling him; \"go to Vienna! It is nearby. And I\r\nknow of a surgeon--one of the greatest!\"\r\n\r\nAnd an hour later, a quiet, confident man was telling them: \"But\r\nyes!--of a certainty he will live. It is fortunate that you were not\r\nvery far away when the accident occurred.\" And only then did Harkness\r\ncatch Diana's eyes in an exchange of glances where unbearable relief\r\nwas tempered with amusement.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe great hospital had its own landing stages on its broad roof. Their\r\nship was anchored there, an object to excite the curiosity of a\r\ngathering throng.\r\n\r\n\"Not a healthy place for me, here in Vienna,\" Harkness remarked. He\r\nwas lifting the ship from its anchorage, its errand of mercy done.\r\n\r\n\"Now where?\" he pondered aloud. The strain of the flight was telling\r\non him.\r\n\r\nThe girl recognized the strained look in his eyes, the deep lines that\r\ntheir experiences had etched upon his face. Gently she drew his hand\r\nfrom the controls.\r\n\r\n\"I will take it,\" she said. \"Trust me. Lie down and rest.\"\r\n\r\nHarkness had witnessed an example of her flying skill; she could\r\nhandle the ship, he knew. And he threw himself upon a cot in the cabin\r\nto sink under the weight of overpowering fatigue.\r\n\r\nHe felt the soft shock of their landing. Diane was calling him, her\r\nhand extended to lead him from the open port. But he was wrenched\r\nsharply from the lethargy that held him at sight of his surroundings,\r\nand the memories they recalled.\r\n\r\nThey were in a park, and their ship rested upon a spacious lawn.\r\nBeyond were trees where a ship had shot crashingly through\r\nstorm-tossed limbs. And, before him, a chateau, where a window had\r\nframed the picture of a girl with outstretched arms.\r\n\r\n\"Trust me,\" Diane had said. And he did trust her. But did she not know\r\nwhat this meant? She was delivering him into the enemy's hands. He\r\nshould have kept himself from sight until he had rallied his\r\nforces.... He was stammering words of protest as she led him toward\r\nthe door. Armed guards were already between him and the ship.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a dark-panelled room Herr Schwartzmann was waiting. His gasp of\r\namazement as he sprang to his feet reflected the utter astonishment\r\nwritten upon his face, until that look gave place to one of\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"Mademoiselle,\" he exclaimed, \"--my dear Mademoiselle Diane! We had\r\ngiven you up for lost. I thought--I thought--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Diane quietly, \"I believe that I can well imagine what you\r\nthought.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Herr Schwartzmann, and the look of satisfaction deepened.\r\n\"I see that you understand now; you will be with us in this matter. We\r\nhave plans for this young man's disposal.\"\r\n\r\nThe puzzled wonder that had clouded the steady eyes of Walter Harkness\r\nwas replaced by cold anger and more than a trace of contempt.\r\n\r\n\"You can forget those plans,\" he told Schwartzmann. \"I have plans of\r\nmy own.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poof!\" exclaimed the heavy, bearded man. \"We will crush you like\r\nthat!\" He struck one heavy fist upon the desk. \"And what will you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Several things,\" said Harkness evenly. \"I shall rid the upper levels\r\nof the monsters: I have a gas that will accomplish that. I shall\r\nrestore the world's flying to normal. And, with that attended to, I\r\nwill give you my undivided attention--raise forty kinds of hell with\r\nHerr Schwartzmann and the interests he represents.\r\n\r\n\"Forgery! Theft! The seizing of my properties by virtue of a lying\r\ndocument! You shall see what this leads to. Your companies will be\r\nwrecked; not a decent man or woman engaged in the business of a decent\r\nworld will deal with you: that is a small part of what I plan.\"\r\n\r\nThe dark face of Herr Schwartzmann was flushed with anger. \"You will\r\nnever leave this place--\" he began. But Harkness would not let him go\r\non: his voice was as hard as the metal of his ship.\r\n\r\n\"You and your assassins!\" he said contemptuously. \"You don't dare\r\ntouch me. There is another man who knows--and Diane, too.\" He paused\r\nto look into the eyes of the girl, which were regarding him with an\r\ninscrutable expression. \"I do not know why she brought me here, but\r\nDiane also knows. You can't throttle us all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Diane!\" The exclamation was wrung involuntarily from Schwartzmann's\r\nlips. \"You speak of Mademoiselle Vernier so familiarly?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe girl's cool voice broke in. She had watched the meeting of the men\r\nin silence; she spoke now as one taking matters into her own quite\r\ncapable hands.\r\n\r\n\"You may omit the incognito, Herr Schwartzmann,\" she said; \"it is no\r\nlonger required. I have enjoyed a birthday since last we met: it was\r\npassed in a place of darkness and anguish, where strong men and brave\r\nforgot their own suffering to try by every means to bring comfort to a\r\ngirl who was facing death. For that reason I say that I enjoyed it.... And\r\nthat birthday was my twenty-first. You know what that means.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Mademoiselle Vernier--pardon!--Mam'selle Delacoeur, surely you\r\nwill support me. My trustee-ship during all these successful years--\"\r\n\r\n\"Is at an end,\" said the cool voice.\r\n\r\n\"I learned more than you were aware of in this last year while I\r\nfamiliarized myself with the interests that would soon be mine. No,\r\nHerr Schwartzmann, your methods do not appeal to me; they are an\r\nanachronism in the world of to-day.\"\r\n\r\nHarkness was standing in stunned silence. \"Delacoeur!\" Diane was\r\nMademoiselle Delacoeur! But that name had been borne by the wealthiest\r\nhouse of France! Old Delacoeur had died, possessed of millions beyond\r\ncounting--and he had left a daughter--Diane!\r\n\r\nHis mind could not grasp the full significance of this. But one thing\r\nwas clear: he could not aspire to the love of one of the queens of\r\nEarth. Whatever faint hope that remained in his heart was lost.... The\r\ncool voice was still speaking.\r\n\r\n\"You may leave now,\" she was saying--this girl who had been his\r\ncomrade, so unfailingly tender, so true and steady in the face of\r\nincredible dangers. And Herr Schwartzmann took his dismissal as one\r\nwho cannot dispute his superior.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe room was silent. Harkness stood with downcast eyes that followed\r\nwith meticulous precision the intricacies of design in the rug on\r\nwhich he stood. A voice was speaking. Not the cool, imperative voice\r\nof Mademoiselle Delacoeur, mistress of vast estates, but the voice of\r\nDiane--the Diane he had learned to love--and it tore at his emotions\r\nuntil his mind was a whirl of conflicting thoughts.\r\n\r\nA tender voice: and there was laughter in it and in the eyes that his\r\nown came despondently to meet.\r\n\r\n\"Such a man, this Walter Harkness!\" she was saying. \"So hard, so\r\nvindictive! Ah, the trouble he will make for me because of my\r\nconscienceless agents!\"\r\n\r\nHarkness threw out his hands in a helpless gesture. \"Don't taunt me,\"\r\nhe said. \"You know you have me tied. You've drawn the charges from all\r\nmy guns. There is nothing to be done.\"\r\n\r\nDiane Delacoeur drew near. The raillery was gone from her voice, and\r\nthe hand that she placed on his arm was trembling.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing?\" she inquired. \"Then, if friendly rivalry is impossible,\r\nwould you consider, could there not be arranged--a merger of our\r\ninterests? I am not thinking now of wealth, of which you will have far\r\nmore than I: there are so much greater things in life--\"\r\n\r\nThe eyes that clung to his were pleading now. And within them was the\r\nlight that Walter Harkness at last could understand and define. He\r\ntook the trembling hand in one of his that was suddenly strong, and\r\nwith the other he raised a lovely face that no longer dared to meet\r\nhis look.\r\n\r\n\"You mean--\" he began, and fumbled for words to express an emotion\r\nthat was beyond words. \"Chet said--why, he said--that you needed me--\"\r\n\r\nHer reply came mingled with a tremulous laugh.\r\n\r\n\"I have the greatest regard,\" she whispered, \"for Chet's judgement.\r\nBut--do you--need me?\"\r\n\r\nWalt Harkness held the soft body close; bent nearer to catch the\r\nwords. And he answered them with his own lips in an ecstasy of emotion\r\nthat made nothing of the thrills to be found in that other\r\nconquest--of a Dark Moon.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SCIENTIFIC HELL\r\n\r\nScience playing the rôle of an up-to-date Persephone, visiting the\r\nunderworld realm of Pluto to wrest from it hidden cosmic secrets, was\r\ndescribed recently at a meeting of the American Geographical Society\r\nat the Engineering Building by Prof. Harlow Shapley, Harvard\r\nastronomical wizard, who told of the ultra-modern scientific version\r\nof Ulysses's descent into Hades or Dante's visit to hell.\r\n\r\nProf. Shapley, to whom 10,000,000 light-years are like a day to any\r\nordinary mortal, and whose astronomical investigations have led him to\r\nthe center of the cosmos, told the scientists present to descend to\r\nthe bowels of the earth and construct therein \"Plutonic Laboratories,\"\r\nwhere a man could learn many things unknown about beginnings and\r\nendings, and where, incidentally he may find a way of utilising the\r\ntremendous heat energy stored up in the \"scientific hell.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the general theme of the \"Third Dimension in Geography,\" Prof.\r\nShapley talked about the past, present and future of the earth-moon\r\nsystem; how in 50,000,000 years our days and months will be\r\nforty-seven times as long as they are now; how after that the moon\r\nwill again approach the earth until it is broken up by tidal\r\ndisruption into ring fragments circulating around the earth like the\r\nring around Saturn; and of shooting stars coming from far-away solar\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\n\"The temperature under the surface of the earth,\" said Prof. Shapley,\r\n\"increases one degree Fahrenheit at every seventy-six feet, about\r\nseventy degrees per mile. In some places in California we get the\r\ntemperature of boiling water at a depth of less than a mile. The\r\ncenter of the earth is roughly 4,000 miles below the surface.\r\n\r\n\"Because of this intense internal heat of the earth it would probably\r\nbe impossible to maintain permanent laboratories at greater depths\r\nthan two miles,\" said the lecturer, \"and, in addition, the\r\ninstallation and maintenance of Plutonic laboratories will be a\r\nscientific adventure of great difficulty and expense. Yet, if carried\r\non in connection with the work of existing mines and borings it may\r\nmark the coming decade as one of the important epochs in man's attempt\r\nto understand the earth.\r\n\r\n\"These Plutonic laboratories, placed at various depths under the\r\nsurface, fully equipped with modern scientific apparatus, and\r\nmaintained indefinitely, will contribute to our knowledge in a dozen\r\nimportant fields of geophysic and astronomy.\"\r\n\r\nWhat Prof. Shapley pointed to as merely a possible by-product of the\r\nproposed scientific \"descent into Hades\" is the commercial possibility\r\nof tapping the earth's internal source of heat. There is 31,000,000\r\ntimes as much natural heat in the earth than in all the coal resources\r\nof the world. He stated that Sir Charles Parsons and John L. Hodgson,\r\nboth noted British engineers, are already engaged in work on this\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Caverns Yawned\r\n\r\n_By Captain S. P. Meek_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From the bump on the side of the submarine came a flash\r\nof red light.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Only Dr. Bird's super-scientific sleuthing stands in the\r\nway of Ivan Saranoff's latest attempt at wholesale destruction.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBells jangled discordantly. A whistle split the air with a piercing\r\nnote. A band blared away on the platform. With a growing rumble of\r\nsound, the Presidential special slowly gathered headway. The President\r\nwaved a final farewell to the crowds at the platform and sat down. He\r\nchatted cheerily with his companions until the train was clear of\r\nCharleston, then rose, and with a word to the others stepped into the\r\ncar. Operative Carnes of the United States Service slumped back in\r\nhis chair with a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\"Thank Goodness, that's over,\" he said. \"I was never so glad to get\r\nhim safely away from a place in my life.\"\r\n\r\nHaggerty of the secret service nodded in agreement. Colonel Holmes,\r\nthe military aide, looked up inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\"Why so? Do you think Charleston an especially dangerous place for him\r\nto be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not ordinarily. Charleston is a very patriotic and loyal city, but I\r\nhave been worried. There have been vague rumors going around. Nothing\r\ndefinite that we could pin down, but enough to make me pretty uneasy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you've worried needlessly. I have been in constant touch with\r\nthe Military Intelligence Division and they have reported nothing\r\nalarming.\"\r\n\r\nHaggerty chuckled at the look of disgust that spread over Carnes'\r\nface. Colonel Holmes bridled visibly.\r\n\r\n\"Now look here, Carnes,\" he began.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, horse-feathers!\" interrupted Carnes. \"The M.I.D. is all right in\r\nits place--Good Lord! What's that?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe train gave a sudden sickening lurch. Colonel Holmes sprawled in an\r\nundignified heap in one corner of the observation platform. Carnes and\r\nHaggerty kept their feet by hanging on to the rails. From the interior\r\nof the car came cries of alarm. The train righted itself for a moment\r\nand then lurched worse than before. There was a scream of brakes as\r\nthe engineer strove to halt the forward progress. The train swayed and\r\nlurched like a ship in a storm. Carnes sprang for the telephone\r\nconnected with the engine cab and rang excitedly.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Bemis,\" he cried when an answer came: \"take off the brakes!\r\nKeep moving at full speed, no matter what happens. What? Use your gun\r\non him, man! Keep moving even if the train tips over!\"\r\n\r\nThe train swayed and rocked worse than ever as it began to gather\r\nmomentum. Carnes looked back along the track and gasped. For three\r\nhundred yards behind them, the track was sinking out of sight. The\r\ntrain forged ahead, but it was evident that it also was sinking into\r\nthe ground. The track behind them suddenly gave. With a roar like a\r\nhundred buildings collapsing, it sank out of sight in a cloud of dust.\r\nThe rear car of the train hung partially over the yawning cavern in\r\nthe earth for an instant before the laboring engine dragged it to\r\nsolid ground. The swaying and lurching grew less. For a mile it\r\npersisted to a slight degree. With a face the color of a sheet, Carnes\r\nmade his way into the train. The President met him at the door.\r\n\r\n\"What's the trouble, Carnes?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"I am not sure, Mr. President. It felt like an earthquake. A great\r\ncavern opened in the earth behind us. Our train was almost trapped in\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"An earthquake! We must stop the train at once and take charge of the\r\nsituation. An emergency of that sort demands immediate attention.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg you to do nothing of the sort, sir. Your presence would add\r\nlittle to the rescue work and your life is too precious to risk.\"\r\n\r\n\"But my duty to the people--\"\r\n\r\n\"Is to keep yourself alive, sir! Mr. President, this may well be an\r\nattempt on your life. There are persons who would give anything to do\r\naway with you, especially at present. You have not endeared yourself\r\nto a certain class in calling for a conference of the powers to curb\r\nRussia's anti-religious tactics.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe President hesitated. He knew Carnes well enough to know that he\r\nusually spoke from accurate knowledge and with good judgment.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President,\" went on the operative earnestly, \"I am responsible to\r\nthe American people for your safety. I beg you to follow my advice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Carnes,\" replied the President, \"I'll put myself in your\r\nhands for the present. What is your program?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your route is well known. Other attempts may be planned since this\r\none failed. Let me have you transferred incognito to another train and\r\nhurried through to Washington secretly. I am going to drop off and go\r\nback. That earthquake needs to be looked into.\"\r\n\r\nAgain the President hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"My desertion of the stricken area will not be favorably regarded. If\r\nI sneak away secretly as though in fear, it will be bad for the public\r\nmorale.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll let the special go through. No one need know that you have left\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--I guess you're right. What are you going to do about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"My first move will be to summon Dr. Bird from Washington.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a good move. You'd better have him bring Dr. Lassen with him.\r\nLassen is a great volcano and earthquake specialist, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will, sir. If you will get ready to drop off at the next connecting\r\npoint, I'll send Haggerty and Bemis with you. The rest of the party\r\ncan remain on the special.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Carnes, if you insist.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCarnes went forward to the operator of the train's radio set. In half\r\nan hour the special came to a stop at a junction point and four men\r\ngot off. Ten minutes later three of them climbed aboard another train\r\nwhich stopped for them. Carnes, the fourth man, hurried to a\r\ntelephone. Fifteen minutes later he was talking to Dr. Bird at the\r\nlatter's private laboratory in the Bureau of Standards.\r\n\r\n\"An earthquake, Carnes?\" exclaimed the doctor as the operative\r\ndescribed the happenings. \"Wait a few minutes, will you?\"\r\n\r\nIn five minutes he was back on the telephone.\r\n\r\n\"It was no earthquake, old dear, whatever it may have been. I have\r\nexamined the records of all three of the Bureau's seismographs. None\r\nof them record even a tremor. What are you going to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever you say, Doctor. I'm out of my depth already.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me think a moment. All right, listen. Go back to Charleston as\r\nquickly as you can and get in touch with the commanding officer at\r\nFort Moultrie. I'll have the Secretary of War telephone him and give\r\nhim orders. Get troops and go to the scene of the catastrophe. Allow\r\nno one near it. Proclaim martial law if necessary. Stop all road and\r\nrail traffic within a radius of two miles. Arrest anyone trying to\r\npass your guard lines. I'll get a plane from Langley Field and come\r\ndown on the run. Is that all clear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly, Doctor. By the way, the President suggested that you bring\r\nDr. Lassen with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Since it wasn't an earthquake, he wouldn't be of much value. However,\r\nI'll bring him if I can get hold of him. Now start things moving down\r\nthere. I'll get some apparatus together and join you in five hours;\r\nsix at the outside. Have a car waiting for me at the Charleston\r\nairport.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCarnes commandeered a passing car and drove back to Charleston. He\r\nmade a wide sweep to avoid the disturbed area and went direct to Fort\r\nMoultrie. Dr. Bird had been good at his word. The troops were\r\nassembled in heavy marching order when the detective arrived. A few\r\nwords to the commanding officer was sufficient to set the trucks\r\nloaded with soldiers in motion. Carnes, accompanied by the colonel and\r\nhis staff, went direct to the scene of the catastrophe.\r\n\r\nHe found a hole in the ground, a hundred feet wide and a quarter of a\r\nmile long, sunk to a depth of fifty feet. He shuddered as he thought\r\nof what would have happened had the Presidential train been in the\r\ncenter of the devastated area instead of at the edge. The edges of the\r\nhole were ragged and sloping as though the earth had caved in to fill\r\na huge cavern underground.\r\n\r\nState and local authorities were already on the ground, striving to\r\nhold back sightseers. They were very glad to deliver their\r\nresponsibility to the representative of the federal government. Carnes\r\nadded their force to that of the military. In an hour a cordon of\r\nguards were stationed about the cavern while every road was picketed\r\ntwo miles away. Fortunately there had been no loss of life and no\r\nrescue work was needed. The earth-shaking had been purely a local\r\nmatter, centered along the line of the railroad track.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to do but wait, Carnes thought furiously. He had\r\nworked with Dr. Bird long enough to have a fair idea of the\r\nscientist's usual lines of investigation.\r\n\r\n\"The first thing he'll want to do is to explore that hole,\" he mused.\r\n\"Probably, that'll mean some excavating. I'd better get a wrecking\r\ntrain with a crane on it and a steam shovel here. A gang of men with\r\npicks and shovels might be useful, too.\"\r\n\r\nHe hurried to the railroad officials. The sight of his gold badge had\r\nthe desired result. Telegraph keys began to click and telephones to\r\nring. Carnes was sorely tempted to explore the hole himself, but he\r\nresisted the temptation. Dr. Bird was not always pleasant when his\r\ncolleagues departed from the orders he had given.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe morning passed, and the first part of the afternoon. Two wrecking\r\ntrains stood with steam up at the edge of the hole. Grouped by the\r\ntrains were a hundred negroes with shovels and picks. Carnes sat at\r\nthe edge of the hole and stared down into it. He was roused from his\r\nreverie by the sound of a motor.\r\n\r\nFrom the north came an airplane. High over the hole it passed, and\r\nthen swerved and descended. On the under side of the wings could be\r\nseen the insignia of the Air Corps. Carnes jumped to his feet and\r\nwaved his hat. Lower came the plane until it roared across the cavern\r\nless than a hundred feet above the ground. Two figures leaned out and\r\nexamined the terrain carefully. Carnes waved again. One of the figures\r\nwaved a hand in reply. The plane rose in the air and straightened out\r\ntoward Charleston.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have the doctor here in a few minutes now,\" said Carnes to the\r\nColonel. \"It might be a good plan to send a motorcycle out along the\r\nCharleston road to bring him in. We don't want the guards to delay\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nThe colonel gave an order and a motorcycle shot off down the road. In\r\nhalf an hour it came sputtering back with a huge Cadillac roaring in\r\nits wake. The car drew up and stopped. From it descended two men. The\r\nfirst was a small, wizened figure with heavy glasses. What hair age\r\nhad left to him was as white as snow. The second figure, which towered\r\nover the first, was one to merit attention anywhere.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Bird was as light on his feet and as quick and graceful as a cat,\r\nbut there was nothing feline about his appearance. He stood well over\r\nsix feet in his stockings and tipped the beam close to the two\r\nhundred mark. Not one ounce of fat was on his huge frame. So fine was\r\nhe drawn that unless one looked closely he would never suspect the\r\nweight of bone and muscle that his unobtrusive tweed suit covered.\r\nPiercing black eyes looked out from under shaggy brows. His face was\r\nlean and browned, and it took a second glance to realize the\r\ntremendous height and breadth of his forehead. A craggy jutting chin\r\nspoke of stubbornness and the relentless following up of a line of\r\naction determined on. His head was topped with an unruly shock of\r\nblack hair which he tossed back with a hand that commanded instant\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nHis hands were the most noteworthy thing about the famous Bureau\r\nscientist. Long slender hands, they were, with slim tapering\r\nfingers--the hands of an artist and a dreamer. The acid stains that\r\nmarred them could not hide their slim beauty, yet Carnes knew that\r\nthose hands had muscles like steel wire and that the doctor boasted a\r\ngrip that could crush the hand of a professional wrestler. He had seen\r\nhim tear a deck of playing cards in half and, after doubling, again in\r\nhalf, with as little effort as the ordinary man would use in tearing a\r\nbare dozen of the cards. As he climbed out of the car his keen black\r\neyes swept around in a comprehensive glance. Carnes, trained observer\r\nthat he was, knew that in that one glance every essential detail which\r\nit had taken him an hour to place had been accurately noted and stored\r\naway in the doctor's mind. He came forward to the detective.\r\n\r\n\"Has anything happened since you telephoned me?\" was his first\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, Doctor. I followed your instructions and also assembled a\r\ncrew of men with excavating tools.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're improving, Carnes. This is Dr. Lassen. This is a little out\r\nof your line. Doctor, but you may see something familiar. What does\r\nit look like to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not like an earthquake, Bird, at all events. Offhand I would say that\r\na huge cavern had been washed in the earth and the ground had caved\r\nin.\"\r\n\r\n\"It looks that way. If you are right, we should find running water if\r\nwe dig deep enough. Have you been down in the hole, Carnes?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Doctor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then that's the first thing to do. You have ropes, of course?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCarnes called to the waiting gang of negroes and a dozen of these\r\nhurried up with ropes. Dr. Bird slung a rope around his body under his\r\narms and was lowered into the hole. The rope slackened as he reached\r\nbottom. Carnes lay on his stomach and looked over the edge. Dr. Bird\r\nwas gingerly picking his way across the ground. He turned and called\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\"Carnes, you and Lassen can come down if you care to.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the detective and the volcanologist joined him in the\r\ncavern. The top surface of the ground was rolled up into waves like\r\nthe sea. The sides of the hole were almost sheer. The naked rock was\r\nexposed for thirty feet. Above the rock could be seen the subsoil, and\r\nthen the layer of top soil and vegetation. Dr. Bird was carefully\r\nexamining the rock wall.\r\n\r\n\"What do you make of these, Lassen?\" he asked, pointing to a row of\r\nhorizontal striations in the rock. The volcanologist studied them.\r\n\r\n\"They might be water marks but if so they are different from any that\r\nI have seen before,\" he said doubtfully. \"It looks as though some\r\nforce had cut the rock away in one sharp stroke.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. Notice this yellow powder on the ridges. Water would have\r\nwashed it away.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Bird stepped forward to the wall and idly attempted to pick up a\r\npinch of the yellow powder he had referred to in his fingers. He gave\r\nan exclamation of surprise as he did so. The powder was evidently fast\r\nto the wall. He drew his knife from his pocket and pried at the stuff.\r\nIt fell readily. He scraped again and caught a speck of the falling\r\npowder in his hand. He gave a cry of surprise, for his hand sank as\r\nthough borne down by a heavy weight. With an effort he lifted his hand\r\nand examined the substance.\r\n\r\n\"Come here, Carnes,\" he said. \"Hold your hand up to catch some of this\r\npowder as I scrape it off.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe detective held up his hand. Dr. Bird pried with his knife and a\r\nshower of dull yellow particles fell. Carnes' hand sank as though the\r\nbits of dust had been a lead bar. He placed his other hand under it\r\nand with an effort lifted both hands up a few inches.\r\n\r\n\"What on earth is this stuff, Doctor?\" he cried. \"It's as heavy as\r\nlead.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a great deal heavier than lead, Carnesy, old dear. I don't know\r\nwhat it is. I am inclined to think you did a wise thing when you sent\r\nfor me. Lassen, take a look at this stuff. Did you ever run into\r\nanything like it?\"\r\n\r\nThe aged volcanologist shook his head. The yellow powder was something\r\nbeyond his ken.\r\n\r\n\"I have been poking around volcanos all my life,\" he said, \"and I have\r\nseen some queer things come out of the ground--but nothing like that.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Bird poked tentatively at the substance for a moment, his brow\r\nfurrowed in lines of thought. He suddenly threw back his shoulders in\r\na gesture of decision.\r\n\r\n\"Send a gang of excavators down here,\" he cried. \"Never mind the power\r\nshovel at present.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDown the ropes swarmed the gang of negroes. Dr. Bird indicated an area\r\nat one end of the cavern and directed them to dig. The blacks flew to\r\nwork with a will. The top soil and subsoil were rapidly tossed into\r\nbuckets and hauled to the surface. When bare rock lay before them, the\r\nnegroes ceased their efforts.\r\n\r\n\"What next, Doctuh, suh?\" asked the foreman.\r\n\r\n\"Get dynamite!\" cried the doctor. \"If I'm right, this underground\r\ncavern is entered by a tunnel. We'll blast away this caved-in rock\r\nuntil we locate it.\"\r\n\r\nThen occurred a strange thing.\r\n\r\n\"There is no need to go to that trouble, Dr. Bird,\" spoke a metallic\r\nvoice, from nowhere, it seemed. The negroes looked at one another.\r\nPicks and shovels fell from nerveless hands.\r\n\r\n\"Your guess about a tunnel is correct, Doctor,\" went on the Voice.\r\n\"There is a tunnel leading away from the spot where you are, but to\r\nfind the end would be useless to you. I have prepared for that.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the blacks came a low moan of fear.\r\n\r\n\"Ha'nts!\" cried one of them. The cry was taken up and spread into a\r\nrolling chorus of fear. With one accord they dropped their tools and\r\nstampeded in a mad rush toward the dangling ropes. Carnes sprang\r\nforward to stop them.\r\n\r\n\"Let them go, Carnes!\" cried the doctor. \"Their work is done for the\r\npresent. Let's locate that radio receiver.\"\r\n\r\n\"That also will be a useless search. Doctor,\" spoke up the Voice\r\nagain. \"I have perfected a transmitter which will send my voice\r\nthrough space and make it audible without the aid of the clumsy\r\napparatus you depend on. I am also able to see you through the miles\r\nof intervening rock without the aid of any instruments at your end.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I presume that you can hear me as well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, Doctor. To save you trouble--and I dislike to see you\r\nwaste the efforts of your really good brain on minor problems--I will\r\ntell you that your surmise is correct. A tunnel does lead both to and\r\nfrom the place where you stand. It twists and turns so that even you\r\nwould be puzzled to plot a general direction. You would have to follow\r\nit inch by inch. If you tried that, naturally I would cause it to\r\ncollapse before you, or on top of you, if you got too close. Be\r\ncontent with what you have seen and seek a better way to trace me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are you, anyway?\" blurted out Carnes.\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible that you do not know? Such is fame. I thought that at\r\nleast my friend Mr. Carnes would suspect that Ivan Saranoff had done\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you're dead!\" protested the detective. \"We killed you when we\r\ndestroyed your helicopter.\"\r\n\r\n\"You killed merely an assistant who had disobeyed my orders. Had I not\r\ndecreed his death, he would be alive to-day. I could kill you as you\r\nstand there; resolve you into nothingness; but I do not choose to do so--yet.\r\nOther attempts I have made you have frustrated, but this time I shall\r\nsucceed. I will institute a reign of terror which will bring your\r\nrich, foolish country to its knees. Listen, while I give you a taste\r\nof my power. The city of Charleston is about to be destroyed.\"\r\n\r\nA thunderous roaring filled the air. Crash followed crash in rapid\r\nsuccession. It sounded as though all the noise of the universe had\r\nbeen concentrated in the cavern. The earth shook and rocked like a\r\nrestless sea. From above came cries of terror.\r\n\r\nThe three men in the cavern were thrown to the ground. Shaken by the\r\nfall and deafened by the tumult, they hung onto irregularities of the\r\nrock on which they lay. Gradually the tumult and the shaking subsided.\r\nThe cries from above became more apparent. Silence finally reigned in\r\nthe cavern and the metallic Voice spoke again.\r\n\r\n\"Go back now and look at Charleston and you will see what to expect.\r\nThe rest of your cities will soon share the same fate. Beware of\r\ntrying to trace my movements, for your lives are in the hollow of my\r\nhand.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe voice died away in silence. From the edge of the hole came a cry.\r\nA Fort Moultrie officer was peering down at them.\r\n\r\n\"Are you all right down there?\" he hailed.\r\n\r\n\"Right as hops,\" called Dr. Bird cheerfully. \"What happened up above?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, Doctor. There seems to be a lot of smoke and fire over\r\nin the direction of the city. I expect the quake shook them up a\r\nlittle this time. What shall we do now?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're ready to come up. First I'm going to send up a wheelbarrow full\r\nof yellow powder. Rig a crane to lift it, for it's too heavy to try to\r\nhoist with ropes.\"\r\n\r\nWith the aid of Carnes and Dr. Lassen, Dr. Bird collected a few cubic\r\ninches of the yellow powder from the ridges in the rock. He made the\r\nwheelbarrow containing it fast to the wire cables of the crane and\r\ngave the signal. Slowly it was raised to the surface. When it had\r\nsafely reached there he turned to his companions.\r\n\r\n\"Grab a rope and let's go,\" he said.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments they were on the upper level. With the efforts of\r\nhalf a dozen men, the body of the wheelbarrow was lifted into the car.\r\nWith a few final words of instruction to the colonel, Dr. Bird and his\r\ncompanions entered the car and were whisked away to the city.\r\n\r\nA spectacle of destruction and ruin awaited them. Fully one-fourth of\r\nthe city had sunk thirty feet into the ground. The sinking was not\r\neven nor uniform. The sunken ground was rolled into huge waves while\r\nbuildings which had collapsed lay in confused heaps on all sides. From\r\na dozen places in the area, columns of fire rose in the air.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Bird wasted little time on the scene before him. His car skirted\r\nthe edge of the huge hole and took the road toward the Charleston\r\nairport, which was in a section which had suffered little. In half an\r\nhour the army transport roared into the air carrying Dr. Bird's\r\nprecious load of yellow powder. Four hours later they dropped to a\r\nlanding at Langley Field.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Carnes,\" said the doctor as they debarked from the plane, \"there\r\nis work ahead. It may be too late to do much to-night, but we have no\r\ntime to waste. Get Bolton on the wire and tell him that we have\r\npositive evidence that Saranoff is still alive and still up to his\r\ndevil's tricks. Start every man of the secret service and every\r\nDepartment of Justice agent that can be spared on the trail. He can't\r\nlive underground all the time, and you ought to get on his tracks\r\nsomehow. I'm going up to the laboratory and see what I can do with\r\nthis stuff. Report to me there to-morrow morning.\"\r\n\r\nCarnes hurried away. Bolton, the chief of the United States Secret\r\nService, had long ago recovered from any professional jealousy he had\r\never felt of Dr. Bird. The doctor's message that Ivan Saranoff, the\r\narch-enemy of society, the head of the Young Labor party, the\r\nunofficial chief of the secret Soviet forces in the United States, was\r\nalive and again in the field against law and order was enough to set\r\nin motion every force that he controlled. Waving aside precedent and\r\ncrashing his way past secretaries, he set in motion not only the\r\nagents of the Department of Justice but also the post-office forces\r\nand the specialized but highly efficient Military and Naval\r\nIntelligence Divisions. The telephone and telegraph wires from\r\nWashington were kept busy all night carrying orders and bringing in\r\nreports. But despite all this activity, it was with a disappointed\r\nface that Operative Carnes sought the doctor in the morning.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Bird was in his private laboratory on the third floor of the\r\nBureau of Standards. When Carnes entered he was seated in a chair at\r\nhis desk. His black eyes shone out from a chalky face like two burned\r\nholes in a blanket. Carnes started at the appearance of utter\r\nweariness presented by the famous scientist. Dr. Bird straightened up\r\nand squared his shoulders as the detective entered.\r\n\r\n\"Any luck, Carnes?\" he asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"None at all, Doctor. We haven't been able to get a single trace of\r\nhis corporeal existence since that submarine was destroyed off the\r\nMassachusetts coast. All we have is Karuska's word that he is still\r\nalive.\"\r\n\r\n\"We heard his voice yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"His or another's.\"\r\n\r\n\"True. Have you set in motion every agency that the government has?\"\r\n\r\n\"Every one. Either Bolton or I have talked to the Chief of Police in\r\nevery large city in the United States and Canada. Every known member\r\nof the Young Labor party who is above the mere rank and file is under\r\nclose surveillance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good enough. Keep at it and you'll trace him eventually. As soon as I\r\nget a few quarts of black coffee into my system, I'll start another\r\nline of search going.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you find out last night?\"\r\n\r\n\"I found that our seismograph recorded the Charleston disaster. It was\r\nmerely a faint jog, about what should be caused by a severe landslide.\r\nThe disaster did not affect the earth's crust, but was purely local.\r\nThat gives me a clue to his method.\"\r\n\r\n\"I described the affair to Bolton and he suggested that it might be\r\ncaused by a disintegrating ray.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Bird snorted. \"When will people learn that there is not, and in\r\nthe nature of things never can be, a disintegrating ray?\" he\r\nexclaimed. \"Of course a ray can be made which will tear things down to\r\ntheir constituent elements, but matter is indestructible, and the idea\r\nof wiping matter out of existence is absurd.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I have heard you say that matter and energy were\r\ninterchangeable.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a different proposition. I believe they are. In fact, if you\r\nremember, Carmichael proved it, although the proof was lost at his\r\ndeath. Nothing of the sort was done at Charleston, however. Do you\r\nknow how much energy is contained in matter? Well, a cubic inch of\r\ncopper would drive the largest ship afloat around the world twice, and\r\nacross the Atlantic to boot. The energy contained in the cubic yards\r\nof rock that were removed under Charleston would have blown the world\r\nto fragments.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what did happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Matter, as you know, is composed of atoms. These atoms are as far\r\nfrom one another, compared to their size, as the stars and planets of\r\nthe universe. Each atom in turn is composed of electrons, negative\r\nparticles of electrical energy, held in position about a fixed central\r\nnucleus of positive electricity known as a proton. I speak now of the\r\nsimplest element. Most of them have many protons and electrons in\r\ntheir make-up. The space between these particles compared with their\r\nsize is such that the universe would be crowded in comparison.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does that lead to?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have described the composition of lead, the densest known element,\r\nover thirteen times as heavy as water, bulk for bulk. Conceive what it\r\nwould mean if some force could compress together these widely\r\nseparated particles until they touched. The resulting substance would\r\nbe an element of almost inconceivable density. Such a condition is\r\napproached in the stars, some of which are as high as four thousand\r\ntimes as dense as the earth. What Saranoff has done is to find some\r\nway of compressing together the atoms into that yellow powder which we\r\nfound in the cavern. He has not gone to the limit, for the stuff is\r\nonly a little over four thousand times as dense as water. A cubic inch\r\nof it weighs one hundred and thirty-two pounds. With its density\r\nincreased to that extent, the volume is reduced accordingly. That was\r\nwhat accounted for those caverns into which the earth tumbled.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll believe you, Doctor,\" replied the detective; \"but I'd believe\r\nyou just as quickly if you swore that the moon was made of cream\r\ncheese made from the milk taken from the milky way. One would be just\r\nas understandable to me as the other.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey were interrupted by the entrance of a waiter who bore a huge pot\r\nof steaming coffee. Dr. Bird's eyes lighted up as a cup was poured.\r\nCarnes knew enough not to interrupt while the doctor poured and drank\r\neight cups of the strong black fluid. As he drank, the lines of\r\nfatigue disappeared from the scientist's face. He sat up as fresh as\r\nthough he had not been working at high pressure the entire night.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Fisher tells me that the amount of caffeine I drink would kill a\r\nhorse,\" he said with a chuckle; \"but sometimes it is needed. I feel\r\nbetter now. Let's get to work.\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Despite Saranoff's words, it must be possible to trace him. He is\r\nundoubtedly releasing his energy from some form of subterranean borer,\r\nand such a thing can be located. The energy he uses must set up\r\nelectrical disturbances which instruments will detect. I have had work\r\nstarted on a number of ultra-sensitive wave detectors which will\r\nrecord any wave-length from zero to five millimeters. We'll send them\r\nto various points along the seacoast. They ought to pick up the stray\r\nwaves from the energy he is using to blast a path through the earth.\r\nI'm not going to bother with the waves from his motor; they may be of\r\nany wave-length, and there would be constant false alarms. I have\r\nanother idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am judging Saranoff from his previous actions. You remember that he\r\nused a submarine in that alien-smuggling scheme the Coast Guard broke\r\nup, and also when he loosed that sea monster on the Atlantic shipping?\r\nHe seems to be rather fond of submarines.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"The amount of energy he uses must be almost inconceivable,\" Dr. Bird\r\nwent on. \"He can hardly carry an amount of fuel which will enable him\r\nto bore underground for very many miles, Charleston is on the coast. I\r\nhave an idea that he uses a submarine to transport his borer from\r\npoint to point. After using the borer he must return to the submarine\r\nfor recharging and transportation to the point where he plans to\r\nstrike next. I already have two hundred planes scouring the sea\r\nlooking for such a craft.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do you expect him to strike next?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no idea. New York and Washington will undoubtedly be targets\r\neventually, but neither of them may be next. Meanwhile, would you like\r\nto do a little more flying?\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely.\"\r\n\r\n\"A plane is waiting for us at Langley Field. I want to look over the\r\ncoast in the vicinity of Charleston Harbor and some of the sounds near\r\nthere. If he is using a sub, he must have a base somewhere.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith a competent pilot at the stick, Carnes and the Doctor spent the\r\nday in exploring. The day yielded no results, and with the coming of\r\ndusk they landed at Savannah for the night. Carnes talked with Bolton\r\nover the telephone, but the secret service chief could report no\r\nfavorable progress. Tired and disgusted, they retired early, but they\r\nwere not destined to enjoy a night of uninterrupted sleep. At one\r\no'clock a telegram was brought to their room. Dr. Bird tore it open\r\nand glanced sleepily at it.\r\n\r\n\"Get up, Carnes,\" he cried sharply. \"Read this!\"\r\n\r\nThe yawning detective glanced at the telegram. It contained only two\r\nwords and a signature. It was signed \"Ivan,\" and read simply, \"Watch\r\nWilmington.\"\r\n\r\n\"What the dickens?\" he exclaimed as he studied the yellow slip. Dr.\r\nBird was hurriedly pulling on his clothes.\r\n\r\n\"Saranoff has slipped a cog this time,\" said the doctor. \"He sent that\r\nas a night message, but it was delivered as a straight message through\r\nerror. He has got further north than I expected. We will turn out our\r\npilot and take off. We should make Wilmington by daybreak. I'll\r\ntelephone Washington and have a couple of destroyers started up\r\nDelaware Bay at once. We ought to give him a first class surprise\r\nparty. I suppose that Philadelphia was meant to be his next stop.\"\r\n\r\nIn an hour the army plane took off into the night. At seven o'clock\r\nthey were circling over Wilmington. The city had not been disturbed.\r\nFor an hour they flew back and forth before they landed. Startling\r\nnews awaited them. At six that morning an earthquake had struck\r\nWilmington, North Carolina. Half the town had sunk into the earth. Dr.\r\nBird struck his brow with his clenched fist.\r\n\r\n\"Score one for the enemy,\" he said grimly. \"We were too sure of\r\nourselves, Carnes. We should have realized that he would hardly be so\r\nfar north yet. Well, I've got to use the telephone while we're\r\nrefueling.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWithin an hour after landing they were again in the air One o'clock\r\nfound them over the stricken city. Dr. Bird wasted no time on\r\nWilmington but headed north along the coast. For a hundred miles he\r\nskirted the shore, two miles out. With an exclamation of\r\ndisappointment he ordered the pilot to turn the plane and retrace his\r\nroute southward, keeping ten miles from the shore. Fifty miles south\r\nhe ordered the plane further out and again turned north. From time to\r\ntime they passed a ship of the air patrol which was steadily skirting\r\nthe coast, but none of them had seen a submarine. Off Cape Hatteras\r\nthe pilot asked for orders.\r\n\r\n\"The gas is running low. Doctor,\" he said. \"I think we had better put\r\nin somewhere and refuel. If we are going to keep the air much longer,\r\nyou had better get a relief pilot. I have been flying for thirty hours\r\nout of the last thirty-six and I'm about done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Head back for Washington,\" said the doctor with a sigh. \"I seem to\r\nhave gone off on a false scent.\"\r\n\r\nAt Cape Charles the pilot swung east over Chesapeake Bay. Hardly had\r\nhe turned than Dr. Bird gave a cry. Excitedly he pointed toward the\r\nwater. Carnes grasped a pair of binoculars and looked in the\r\ndirection Dr. Bird was indicating. Sliding along under the water was\r\na long cigar-shaped shadow.\r\n\r\n\"It's a submarine!\" exclaimed Carnes. \"Is it a navy ship or the one\r\nwe're after?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's no navy sub,\" said the doctor positively. \"It's not the right\r\nshape. Look at that bump on the side!\"\r\n\r\nThe symmetry of the craft was marred by a huge projection on one side\r\nthat could not be explained by the pattern of any known type of\r\nunder-water craft.\r\n\r\n\"He's towing the borer!\" cried the doctor in exultation. He took up\r\nthe speaking tube. \"Turn back to sea!\" he cried. \"We passed four\r\ndestroyers less than ten miles out. We want to get in touch with\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nThe plane roared out to sea while Dr. Bird feverishly sounded the\r\n\"Alnav\" call on the radio sending set. In a few minutes an answer\r\ncame. From their point of vantage they could see flags break out at\r\nthe peak of the destroyer leader. The four ships turned into column\r\nformation and stormed at full speed into the bay. The plane raced\r\nahead to guide them.\r\n\r\n\"We've got him this time, Doctor!\" cried Carnes in exultation. He\r\npointed to the bay below where the submarine was still making its way\r\nslowly forward. Dr. Bird shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"I hope so,\" he said, \"but I have my doubts. Saranoff is no fool. He\r\nwouldn't walk into a trap like this unless he had some means of\r\nescape. Here comes the first destroyer. We'll soon know the truth.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith the radio set he directed the oncoming boat. The destroyer\r\nreduced to half speed and changed direction slightly. From side to\r\nside she maneuvered until she was less than half a mile behind the\r\nsubmarine and headed straight for it. Dr. Bird tapped a few words on\r\nhis key. With a belch of smoke, the destroyer lurched forward. She\r\ncut the waters with her sharp bow, throwing up a wave higher than her\r\ndecks. Dr. Bird watched anxiously.\r\n\r\nThe destroyer was almost over the submarine and Dr. Bird's fingers\r\ntrembled on the key. One word from him would send a half dozen depth\r\ncharges into the water. On came the destroyer until it was directly\r\nover the underseas craft. Dr. Bird pounded his key rapidly.\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord!\" cried Carnes.\r\n\r\nFrom the bump on the side of the submarine came a flash of red light.\r\nThe destroyer staggered for a moment, and the entire central section\r\nof the ill-fated ship disappeared. The bow and stern came together\r\nwith a rush and went down in a swirling maelstrom of water. The plane\r\nlurched in the air as a thundering crash rose from the sea.\r\n\r\nThe second destroyer, in no way daunted by the fate of her colleague,\r\nrushed to the attack. Dr. Bird pounded his key frantically in an\r\nattempt to turn her back. His message was too late or was\r\nmisunderstood. Straight over the submarine went the second ship. Again\r\ncame the red flash. The forward half of the destroyer disappeared and\r\nthe stern slid down into a huge hole which had opened in the water.\r\n\r\n\"He's invulnerable!\" cried the doctor. He pounded his key with\r\nfeverish rapidity. The two remaining destroyers slackened speed and\r\nveered off. Slowly, as though loath to turn their backs on the enemy,\r\nthey headed out for the broad Atlantic and comparative safety.\r\n\r\nThe submarine went slowly on her way. She did not turn west at the\r\nmouth of the Potomac but continued on up the bay. As long as there was\r\nlight enough, the doctor's plane kept above her but the fading light\r\nsoon made it impossible to see her. When she had disappeared from\r\nview, the doctor reluctantly gave the word to return to Washington.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Where do you suppose he will attack next, Doctor?\" asked Carnes when\r\nthey sat again in the doctor's private laboratory.\r\n\r\n\"Washington, of course,\" said Dr. Bird absently as he looked up from a\r\npile of telegrams he was running through.\r\n\r\n\"Why Washington?\"\r\n\r\n\"Use your head. Representatives of every civilized power are in\r\nWashington now at the President's invitation to consider means of\r\nhalting the anti-religious activities of the Soviets. The destruction\r\nof the city and the killing of these men would be a telling blow for\r\nRussia to strike.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Doctor, you don't think--\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, Carnes; that will keep. Let me read these telegrams.\"\r\n\r\nFor half an hour silence reigned in the laboratory. Dr. Bird laid down\r\nthe last message with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Carnes,\" he said, \"I'm check-mated. I sent out a hundred\r\nultra-sensitive short wave receivers yesterday. Four of them were\r\nlocated within fifty miles of Wilmington, North Carolina. One of these\r\nfour was destroyed, but none of the others detected a sign of a wave\r\nduring the attack. One of them was within a hundred feet of the edge\r\nof the hole. If he isn't using a ray of some sort, what on earth is he\r\nusing?\"\r\n\r\n\"It looked like a flash of red light when it came from the submarine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but it couldn't be light. Let me think.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor sat for a few minutes with corrugated brows. Suddenly he\r\nsprang to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"I deserve to be beaten,\" he cried. \"Why didn't I think of that\r\npossibility before?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe hurried into his laboratory and brought out a small box with a\r\nglass front. From the top projected a spike topped with a ball.\r\nThrough the glass, Carnes could see a thin sheet of metal hanging\r\npendant from the spike.\r\n\r\n\"An electroscope,\" explained the doctor. \"That sheet of metal is\r\nreally two sheets of gold-leaf, at present stuck together. If I rub a\r\npiece of hard rubber with a woolen cloth, the rod will become charged\r\nwith static electricity. If I then touch the ball with it, the charge\r\nis transferred to the electroscope and causes the two sheets of\r\ngold-leaf to stand apart at an angle. Watch me.\"\r\n\r\nHe took a hard rubber rod and rubbed it briskly on his coat sleeve. As\r\nhe touched the ball of the electroscope the sheets of gold-leaf\r\nseparated and stood apart at a right angle.\r\n\r\n\"As long as the air remains non-conducting, the two bits of gold-leaf\r\nwill hold that position. The air, however, is not a perfect insulator\r\nand the charge will gradually leak off. If I bring a bit of\r\nradioactive substance, for instance, pitchblende, near the\r\nelectroscope, the charge will leak rapidly. Do you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but how is that going to help us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Saranoff is accomplishing his result by artificially compressing the\r\natoms. It is inevitable that he will do it imperfectly, and some\r\nelectrons will be loosened and escape. These electrons, traveling up\r\nthrough the earth will make the air conducting. To-morrow we will have\r\na means of locating the borer under ground.\"\r\n\r\n\"Once you locate it, how will you fight it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the problem I must work out to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could we bury a charge of explosive and blow it up?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Ordinary explosives would be useless,\" the doctor answered. \"They\r\nwould react in the same manner as other substances, and would be\r\nrendered harmless. Radite might do the work if it could be placed in\r\nthe path, but it couldn't be. We may locate the position and depth of\r\nthe borer, but long before we could dig and blast a hole deep enough\r\nto place a charge of radite before it, it would have passed on or\r\nchanged direction. No, Carnes, old dear, the only solution that I can\r\nsee is to turn his own guns on him. If I can, before morning,\r\nduplicate his device, we can train it on the spot where he is and\r\nreduce him and his machine to a pinch of yellow powder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you do it, Doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"What one man's brain can device, another man's brain can duplicate.\r\nThe only question is that of time. I am confident that Saranoff will\r\nattack Washington to-morrow. If I can do the job to-night, we may save\r\nthe city. If not--At any rate, Carnes, your job will be to see that\r\nthe President and all of the heads of the government are out of the\r\ncity by morning. The President may refuse to leave. Knowing him as I\r\ndo, I rather expect he will.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case, the issue is in the hands of the gods. Now get out of\r\nhere. I want to work. Report back at daybreak with a car.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Bird turned back to his laboratory.\r\n\r\n\"He must be using a ray of some sort, possibly a radium emanation,\" he\r\nmuttered to himself. \"That would have no wave motion and might\r\naccomplish the result, although I would expect the exact opposite from\r\nit. The first thing to do is to examine that powder with a\r\nspectroscope and see if I can get a clue to the electronic\r\narrangement.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Carnes arrived at the Bureau of Standards at dawn be rubbed his\r\neyes in astonishment. The buildings were lighted up and the grounds\r\nswarmed with workmen. Before the buildings were lined up a dozen\r\ntrucks and twice that many touring cars. A cordon of police held back\r\nthe curious. Carnes' gold badge won him an entrance and he hurried up\r\nthe stairs to Dr. Bird's laboratory. The doctor's face was drawn and\r\nhaggard, but his eyes glowed with a feverish light. Workmen were\r\ncarrying down huge boxes.\r\n\r\n\"What's up, Doctor?\" demanded the detective.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you got here at last, did you? You're just in time. If you'd been\r\nfifteen minutes later, you would have found us gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gone where?\"\r\n\r\n\"Out into Maryland in an attempt to stop Saranoff in his progress\r\ntoward Washington.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you found your means of combating him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so, although it is not what I started out to get. Did you\r\nbring a car as I told you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's waiting below.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good enough. I'll go in it. Williams, are those projectors all\r\nloaded?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Dr. Bird. The magnet will be ready to go in five minutes. The\r\nelectroscopes and the other light stuff are all loaded and ready to\r\nmove.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have done well. I'll let you bring the trucks and heavy equipment\r\nwhile I go ahead with the instruments. Take the road out toward Upper\r\nMarlboro. If I don't meet you before, stop there for orders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Doctor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Carnes, let's go.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe raced down the stairs with the detective at his heels. He went\r\nalong the line of touring cars and spoke briefly to the drivers. He\r\nclimbed into the car which Carnes had brought. As it started the other\r\ncars fell in behind it. At a speed of forty miles an hour, with a\r\ndetachment of motorcycle police leading the van, the cavalcade rolled\r\nout through the deserted streets of Washington. Once clear of the\r\ncity, the speed was increased.\r\n\r\n\"Did you persuade the President to leave?\" asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"There wasn't a chance. The papers panned him so much for following my\r\nadvice at Charleston that he has turned stubborn. He says that if all\r\nthe forces of the government can't protect him against one man, he is\r\nwilling to die.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've got to save him,\" said Dr. Bird grimly. \"Hello, there's the\r\nChesapeake ahead.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor studied the country.\r\n\r\n\"We are about opposite the place where we left that sub last night. I\r\nfancy that Saranoff will operate from there, for it didn't move during\r\nthe last half hour we watched it. We'll go back inland a mile or two\r\nand spread out. I have no idea how far his radiations will affect the\r\nelectroscopes, but we'll try four hundred-yard intervals to start.\r\nThat will enable us to cover a line twelve miles long.\"\r\n\r\nHe picked up a megaphone and spoke to the line of cars behind him.\r\n\r\n\"Take up four hundred yard intervals when we spread out,\" he said.\r\n\"Every man keep his headphone on and listen for orders. Follow my car\r\nuntil it stops, then turn north and south and drop your men at\r\nintervals.\"\r\n\r\nHe reentered the car and led the way back for two miles. He halted his\r\ncar at a crossroad. The cars following him turned and went to the\r\nnorth and south. Besides Carnes and the doctor, the car held two men\r\nfrom the Bureau. As they climbed out, Carnes saw that one of them\r\ncarried a portable radio sending set, while the other bore an\r\nelectroscope and a rubber rod. The radio operator set up his device,\r\nwhile the other man rubbed his coat sleeve briskly with the hard\r\nrubber and then touched the ball of the electroscope with it. The two\r\nbits of gold-leaf spread out.\r\n\r\n\"While we're waiting, I'll explain something of this to you, Carnes,\"\r\nsaid the doctor. \"At four hundred-yard intervals are men with\r\nelectroscopes like this one. My attempt to locate Saranoff by means of\r\nwave detectors was a failure. That proved that the ray he was using is\r\nnot of the wave type. The other common ray is the cathode ray type\r\nwhich does not consist of vibrations but of a stream of electrons,\r\nnegative particles of electricity, traveling in straight lines of high\r\nvelocity. He must be knocking loose some of the electrons when he\r\ncollapses the atoms. The rate of discharge of these electroscopes will\r\ngive us a clue to the nearness of his device.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Once you locate him, how do you propose to attack him?\"\r\n\r\n\"The obvious method, that of using his own ray against him, fell down.\r\nHowever, in attempting to produce it, I stumbled on another weapon\r\nwhich may be equally effective. I am going to try to use an exact\r\nopposite of his ray. The cathode ray, when properly used, will bombard\r\nthe atoms and knock electrons loose. I perfected last night a device\r\non which I have been working for months. It is a super-cathode ray. I\r\ntested it on the yellow powder and find that I can successfully\r\nreverse Saranoff's process. He can contract matter together until it\r\noccupies less than one one-thousandth of its original volume. My ray\r\nwill destroy this effect and restore matter to something like its\r\noriginal condition.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the effect will be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Use your imagination. He blasts out a hole by condensing the rock to\r\na pinch of yellow powder. He moves forward into the hole he has made.\r\nI come along and reverse his process. The yellow powder expands to its\r\noriginal volume and the hole he has made ceases to exist. What must\r\nhappen to the foreign body which had been introduced into the hole\r\nthat is no longer a hole?\"\r\n\r\nCarnes whistled.\r\n\r\n\"At any rate, I hope that I am never in a hole when that happens.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I devoutly hope that Saranoff is. I met with one difficulty. My\r\nray will not penetrate the depth of solid rock which separates his\r\nborer from the surface.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how will you reach him to crush him? You don't expect to drill\r\ndown ahead of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is my stroke of genius, Carnes. I am going to make him bore the\r\nhole down which my ray will travel to accomplish his destruction. The\r\ncathode ray and rays of that type--\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, Doctor,\" interrupted the radio operator. \"I have just\r\nreceived a message from the squadron leader of the planes patrolling\r\nthe bay. He states that every inch of the Chesapeake Bay and the\r\nPotomac River have been examined and no submarine is visible.\"\r\n\r\n\"I expected that. He will have opened a cavern under the earth, in\r\nwhich his craft is safe from aerial observation. Once the borer has\r\nleft it, it is invulnerable no longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"What reply shall I make?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell him to keep up a constant patrol. Three navy subs with\r\nradite-charged torpedos are on their way up the bay, together with\r\nhalf a dozen destroyers. The subs will scout for such a hole as I have\r\ndescribed and will attack his sub if they find it. The destroyers will\r\nstand by and support them.\"\r\n\r\nThe operator turned to his instrument. The electroscope observer\r\nclaimed the doctor's attention.\r\n\r\n\"There is a steady leak here, Doctor,\" he said. \"I get a discharge in\r\neleven minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably a result of his work in opening the hiding place for his\r\nsubmarine last night. Keep it charged, Jones.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you say about the cathode ray, Doctor?\" asked Carnes.\r\n\r\n\"The cathode ray? Oh, yes. I said that rays of that type were\r\nattracted by--Hello, look there!\"\r\n\r\nFrom a point a mile to the north a ball of red fire streaked up into\r\nthe air. A moment later similar signals rose from other watchers in\r\nthe line.\r\n\r\n\"It works, Carnes!\" cried the doctor as he rushed for the car. \"We've\r\ngot him this time!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe car raced along the road. At the first man who had signalled, it\r\nslackened speed. The doctor leaned out.\r\n\r\n\"What is your discharge rate?\" he called.\r\n\r\n\"Eight minutes. Doctor.\"\r\n\r\nThe car rolled on. Dr. Bird repeated the question at the next post and\r\nwas told that the electroscope there was losing its charge in seven\r\nminutes. The next man reported four minutes and the next man, one\r\nminute. The following station reported three minutes.\r\n\r\n\"It's right along here somewhere!\" cried the doctor. \"Summon everyone\r\nto this point and take up twenty-yard intervals.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the north and south the cars came racing in. The instruments were\r\nspread out along a new line twenty yards apart. As the borer was\r\nlocated the intervals were decreased to fifteen feet. Dr. Bird thrust\r\na long white rod into the ground.\r\n\r\n\"His path lies under here,\" he said. \"Into the cars and go back a mile\r\nand test again.\"\r\n\r\nThe borer was making slow progress, and it was half an hour before Dr.\r\nBird drove the second stake in the ground. With a transit he took the\r\nbearing of the path and laid it out on a large scale map.\r\n\r\n\"We'll stop him between Marr and Ritchie,\" he announced. \"Jones, I am\r\ngoing back and set up my apparatus. Keep track of his movements. If\r\nhe changes direction, let me know at once.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe doctor's car tore off to the west. Near Upper Marlboro, he met the\r\nconvoy of trucks and led them to the selected spot. The trucks were\r\nunloaded and the apparatus laid out. Attached to a huge transformer\r\nwere a dozen strange-looking projectors. What puzzled Carnes most was\r\na huge built-up steel bar wound about with heavy cable. Dr. Bird had\r\nthis bar erected on a truck and located it with great exactness. The\r\nprojectors were set up in a battery just east of the bar.\r\n\r\n\"How about power?\" asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have it in five minutes,\" replied one of the men. \"A power\r\ntransmission line carrying twenty-two thousand passes within two\r\nhundred yards of here. We are phoning now to have the power cut off.\r\nAs soon as the line is dead we'll cut it and bring the ends here.\"\r\n\r\nThe electrician was good at his word. In five minutes the power line\r\nhad been cut and cables spliced to the ends. The cables were brought\r\nto the doctor's apparatus and the main lines were rigged to the ends\r\nof the cable wound around the bar. In parallel on taps, the projectors\r\nwere connected. Huge oil-switches were placed in both lines.\r\n\r\n\"All ready, Doctor,\" reported the electrician.\r\n\r\n\"Good work, Avent. He'll be here soon, I fancy.\"\r\n\r\nA car whirled up and a man leaped out with a surveyor's rod. He set it\r\nup on the ground while a companion watched through binoculars. He\r\nmoved it a hundred yards to the north and then back twenty. When he\r\nwas satisfied he turned to Dr. Bird.\r\n\r\n\"The direction of movement has not changed,\" he said. \"The path will\r\npass under this stake.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the doctor's supervision, the truck carrying the bar moved\r\nforward until it stood over the surveyor's stake. The battery of\r\nprojectors moved to a new location a few feet east of the rod. Other\r\ncars came racing up.\r\n\r\n\"He's less than half a mile away, Doctor!\" cried Jones.\r\n\r\n\"Get your electroscopes out and spot him a hundred yards from this\r\ntruck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Doctor.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe men with the instruments spread out along the path of the borer.\r\nBriskly they rubbed their sleeves with the rubber rods and charged\r\ntheir instruments. Almost as fast as they charged them, the tiny bits\r\nof gold-leaf collapsed together. Presently the man on the end of the\r\nline shouted.\r\n\r\n\"Maximum discharge!\" he cried.\r\n\r\nDr. Bird looked around. Every man stood ready at his post. The next\r\nman signalled that the borer was under him. Carnes felt himself\r\ntrembling. He did not know what the doctor was about to do, but he\r\nfelt that the fate of America hung in the balance. Whether it remained\r\nfree or became the slave of Soviet Russia would quickly be decided.\r\n\r\nSlowly the borer made its way forward. With a pale face, Jones\r\nsignalled the news that it had reached the point the doctor had\r\nindicated. Dr. Bird raised his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Power!\" he cried.\r\n\r\nThe electrician closed a switch and power surged through the cables\r\naround the bar. The earth rocked and quivered. A hundred yards east of\r\nthe bar a flash of intolerable red light sprang from the ground with a\r\nroar like that of Niagara. Toward the bar it moved with gathering\r\nmomentum.\r\n\r\n\"Back, everyone!\" roared Dr. Bird.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe men sprang back. The searing ray approached the bar. It touched\r\nit, and bar and truck disappeared into thin air. A splutter of sparks\r\ncame from the severed ends of the wire. The ray disappeared. Carnes\r\nrubbed his eyes. Where the truck had rested on solid ground was now a\r\ngaping wound in the earth.\r\n\r\n\"Projector forward!\" cried the doctor. \"Hurry, men!\"\r\n\r\nThe trucks bearing the battery of projectors moved forward until they\r\nwere at the edge of the hole. Portable cranes swung the lamps out, and\r\nmen swarmed over them. The projectors were pointed down the hole.\r\nCarnes joined the doctor in peering down. A hundred yards below them\r\nthe terrible ray was blazing. As they watched, its end came in sight.\r\nThe ray was being projected forward from the end of a black\r\ncigar-shaped machine which was slowly moving forward.\r\n\r\n\"That's your target, men!\" cried the doctor. \"Align on it and signal\r\nwhen you are ready!\"\r\n\r\nOne by one the projector operators raised their hands in the signal of\r\n\"ready.\" Still the doctor waited. Suddenly the forward movement of the\r\nblack body ceased. The ray was stationary for a moment and then moved\r\nslowly upward. A terrific roaring came from the cavern.\r\n\r\n\"Projector switch!\" roared the doctor, his heavy voice sounding over\r\nthe tumult.\r\n\r\n\"Ready, sir!\" a shrill voice answered.\r\n\r\n\"Power!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom each of the projectors a dazzling green ray leaped forth as the\r\nswitch was closed. There was a crash like all the thunder of the\r\nuniverse. Before the astonished eyes of the detective, the hole\r\nclosed. Not only did it close but the earth piled up until the trucks\r\nwere overturned and the green rays blazed in all directions.\r\n\r\n\"Power off!\" roared the doctor.\r\n\r\nThe switch was opened and the ray died out. Before them was a huge\r\nmound where a moment before had been a hole.\r\n\r\n\"You see, Carnes,\" said Dr. Bird with a wan smile. \"I made him bore\r\nhis own hole, as I promised.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw it, but I don't understand. How did you do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Magnetism. Rays of the cathode type are deflected from their course\r\nby a magnet. His ray proved unusually susceptible, and I drew it\r\ntoward a huge electro-magnet which I improvised. When the magnet was\r\ndestroyed, the ray dropped back ... to its original ... direction.\r\nThat's the end ... of Saranoff. That is ... I hope ... it is.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Bird's voice had grown slower and less distinct as he talked. As\r\nhe said the last words, he slumped gently to the ground. Carnes sprang\r\nforward with a cry of alarm and bent over him.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, Doctor?\" he demanded anxiously, shaking the\r\nscientist. Dr. Bird rallied for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Sleep, old dear,\" he murmured. \"Four days--no sleep. Go 'way, I'm ...\r\ngoing ... to ... sleep....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Advertisement]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Exile of Time\r\n\r\nPART TWO OF A FOUR-PART NOVEL\r\n\r\n_By Ray Cummings_\r\n\r\nWHAT HAS GONE BEFORE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Where nothing had been stood a cage.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Young lovers of three eras are swept down the torrent of\r\nthe sinister cripple Tugh's frightful vengeance.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Let me out! Let me out!\" came the cry.\r\n\r\n\"What's that, Larry? Listen!\" I said to my companion.\r\n\r\nWe stopped in the street. We had heard a girl's scream: then her\r\nfrantic, muffled words to attract our attention. Then we saw her white\r\nface at the basement window. It was on the night of June 8-9, 1950,\r\nwhen I was walking with my friend Larry Gregory through Patton Place\r\nin New York City. My name is George Rankin. In a small, deserted house\r\nwe found the strange girl; brought her out; took her away in a taxi to\r\nan alienist for examination.\r\n\r\nWe thought she might be demented--this strangely beautiful girl, in a\r\nlong white satin dress with a powdered white wig, and a black beauty\r\npatch on her cheek--for she told us that the deserted house had just a\r\nfew minutes before been her house; and though we assured her this was\r\nthe summer of 1935, she told us her name was Mistress Mary Atwood,\r\nthat her father was Major Atwood of General Washington's staff, and\r\nthat she had just now come from the year 1777!\r\n\r\nWe took her to my friend Dr. Alten and she told her strange story. A\r\ncage, like a room of shining metal bars, had materialized in her\r\ngarden. A great mechanical monster--a thing of metal, ten feet tall\r\nand fashioned in the guise of a man--had captured her. She was whirled\r\naway into the future, in the cage; then she was released, the cage had\r\nvanished, and Larry and I had passed by the house and rescued her.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCaptured by a Robot in a Time-traveling cage! We tried to fathom it.\r\nAnd why had she been captured? Had she some enemy? She could only\r\nthink of a fellow called Tugh. He was a hideously repulsive cripple\r\nwho had dared make love to her and had threatened vengeance against\r\nher and her father.\r\n\r\n\"Tugh!\" exclaimed Alten. \"A cripple? Why, he lived in New York City\r\nthree years ago, in 1932!\"\r\n\r\nA coincidence? The Tugh whom Mary knew in 1777 seemed the same person\r\nwho, in 1932, had gotten into trouble with the New York police and had\r\nvowed some weird vengeance against them and all the city. And, equally\r\nstrange, this house on Patton Place where we had found the girl was\r\nowned by the same Tugh who now was wanted for the murder of a girl and\r\ncould not be found!\r\n\r\nWith Dr. Alten, and Mary Atwood, Larry and I returned that same night\r\nto the house on Patton Place. Near dawn, in the back yard of the\r\nhouse, the Time-traveling cage appeared again! The Robot came from it.\r\nAlten, Larry and I attacked the monster, and were defeated. When the\r\nfight was over, Larry and Alten lay senseless. The mechanical thing\r\nseized Mary and me, shoved us in the cage and whirled us away into\r\nTime.\r\n\r\nLarry presently recovered. He rushed into Patton Place, and in his\r\npath another, much smaller cage appeared. A man and a girl leaped from\r\nit; and, when Larry fought with them, they carried him off in their\r\nvehicle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe learned they were chasing the larger cage. They were not hostile to\r\nLarry and presently made friends with him. They were Princess Tina and\r\na young scientist named Harl, both of the world of 2930. The two cages\r\nhad come from 2930. The larger one had been stolen by an\r\ninsubordinate Robot named Migul--a pseudo-human mechanism running\r\namuck.\r\n\r\nAgain Tugh, the cripple, was mentioned. In 2930 he was a prominent\r\nscientist! But Harl and Tina mistrusted him. Tugh and Harl had\r\ninvented the Time-traveling cages. It was a strange Time-world, that\r\n2930, which now was described to Larry. It was an era in which all\r\nwork was done by mechanisms--fantastic Robots, all but human! And they\r\nwere now upon the verge of revolt against their human masters! Migul\r\nwas one of them. It had stolen one of the cages, gone to 1777 and\r\nabducted Mary Atwood; and now, with her and me in its power, was\r\nheaded back for 1777 upon some strange mission. Was it acting for the\r\ncripple Tugh? It seemed so. Tina and Harl, with Larry, chased our cage\r\nand stopped in a night of the summer of 1777.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, from the house on Patton Place, in June of 1935,\r\nRobots began appearing. A hundred of them, or a thousand, no one knew.\r\nWith swords and flashing red and violet light-beams they spread over\r\nthe city in the never-to-be-forgotten Massacre of New York! It was the\r\nbeginning of the vengeance Tugh had threatened! Nothing could stop the\r\nmonstrous mechanical men. For three days and nights New York City was\r\nin chaos. The red beams were frigid. They brought a mid-summer\r\nsnowstorm! Then the violet beams turned the weather suddenly hot. A\r\ncrazy wild storm swept the wrecked city. Torrential hot rain poured\r\ndown. Then, one dawn, the beams vanished; the Robots retreated into\r\nthe house on Patton Place and disappeared; and New York was left a\r\nhorror of death and desolation.\r\n\r\nThe vengeance of Tugh against the New York City of 1935 was complete.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n_The Murder of Major Atwood_\r\n\r\n\"We are late,\" Tina whispered. It was that night in 1777 when she,\r\nLarry and Harl stepped from their Time-traveling cage; and again I am\r\npicturing the events as Larry afterward described them to me. \"Migul,\r\nin the other cage, was here,\" Tina added. \"But it's gone now. Exactly\r\nwhere was it, I wonder?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mary Atwood said it appeared in the garden.\"\r\n\r\nThey crept down the length of the field, just inside the picket fence.\r\nIn a moment the trees and an intervening hillock of ground hid the\r\ndimly shining outline of their own cage from their sight. The dirt\r\nroad leading to Major Atwood's home was on the other side of the\r\nfence.\r\n\r\n\"Wait,\" murmured Tina. \"There is a light in the house. Someone is\r\nawake.\"\r\n\r\n\"When was Migul here, do you think?\" Larry whispered.\r\n\r\n\"Last night, perhaps. Or to-night. It may be only an hour--or a few\r\nminutes ago.\"\r\n\r\nThe faint thud of horses' hoofs on the roadway made Tina and Larry\r\ndrop to the ground. They crouched in the shadows of a tree. Galloping\r\nhorses were approaching along the road. The moon went under a cloud.\r\n\r\nFrom around a bend in the road a group of horsemen came. They were\r\ngalloping; then they slowed to a trot; a walk. They reined up in the\r\nroad not more than twenty feet from Larry and Tina. In the starlight\r\nthey showed clearly--men in the red and white uniform of the army of\r\nthe King. Some of them wore short, dark cloaks. They dismounted with a\r\nclanking of swords and spurs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTheir voices were audible. \"Leave the steeds with Jake. Egad, we've\r\nmade enough noise already.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here, Jake, you scoundrel. Stay safely here with the mounts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Tony. You and I will circle. We have him, this time. By the\r\nKing's garter, what a fool he is to come into New York at such a\r\ntime!\"\r\n\r\n\"He wants to see his daughter, I venture.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right, Tony. And have you seen her? As saucy a little minx as there\r\nit in the Colonies. I was quartered here last month. I do not blame\r\nthe major for wanting to come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here, take my bridle, Jake. Tie them to the fence.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a swift confusion of voices; laughter. \"If you should hear a\r\npistol shot, Jake, ride quickly back and tell My Lord there was a\r\nfracas and you did not dare remain.\"\r\n\r\n\"I only hope he is garbed in the rebel white and blue--eh, Tony? Then\r\nhe will yield like an officer and a gentleman; which he is, rebel or\r\nno.\"\r\n\r\nThey were moving away to surround the house. Two were left.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Tony. We will pound the front knocker in the name of the\r\nKing. A feather in our cap when we ride him down to the Bowling Green\r\nand present him to My Lord....\"\r\n\r\nThe voices faded.\r\n\r\nLarry gripped the girl beside him. \"They are British soldiers going to\r\ncapture Major Atwood! What can we--\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe never finished. A scream echoed over the somnolent night--a voice\r\nfrom the rear of the house. A man's voice.\r\n\r\nThe red-coated soldiers ran forward. In the field, close against the\r\nfence, Tina and Larry were running.\r\n\r\nFrom the garden of the house a man was screaming. Then there were\r\nother voices; servants were awakening in the upper rooms. The\r\nscreaming, shouting man rushed through the house. He appeared at the\r\nfront door, standing between the high white colonial pillars which\r\nsupported the overhead porch. A yellow light fell upon him through the\r\nopened doorway. An old, white-headed negro appeared. Larry and Tina,\r\nin the nearby field, stood stricken by the scene.\r\n\r\n\"The marster--the marster--\" He shouted this wildly.\r\n\r\nThe British officers ran at him.\r\n\r\n\"You, Thomas, tell us where the major is. We've come for him; we know\r\nhe's here! Don't lie!\"\r\n\r\n\"But the marster--\" He choked over it.\r\n\r\n\"A trick, Tony! Egad, if he is trying to trick us--\"\r\n\r\nThey leaped to the porch and seized the old negro.\r\n\r\n\"Speak, you devil!\" They shook him. \"The house is surrounded. He\r\ncannot escape!\"\r\n\r\n\"But the marster is--is dead! My girl Tollie saw it and then she\r\nswooned.\" He steadied himself. \"He--the major's in the garden, Marster\r\nTony. Lying there dead! Murdered! By a ghost, Tollie says. A great,\r\nwhite, shining ghost that came to the garden and murdered him!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf you were to delve very closely into certain old records of\r\nRevolutionary New York City during the year 1777, you doubtless would\r\nfind mention of the strange murder of Major Atwood, who, coming from\r\nNew Jersey, is thought to have crossed the river well to the north of\r\nthe city, mounted his horse--which, by pre-arrangement, one of his\r\nretainers had left for him somewhere to the south of Dykeman's\r\nfarm--and ridden to his home. He came, not as a spy, but in full\r\nuniform. And no sooner had he reached his home when he was strangely\r\nmurdered. There was only a negro tale of an apparition which had\r\nappeared in the garden and murdered the master.\r\n\r\nLarry and I have found cursory mention of that. But I doubt if the\r\ngroup of My Lord Howe's gay young blades who were sent north to\r\ncapture Major Atwood ever reported exactly what happened to them. The\r\nold Dutch ferryman divulged that he had been hired to ferry the\r\nhomecoming major; this, too, is recorded. But Tony Green and his\r\nfellow officers, sent to apprehend the colonial major, found him\r\ninexplicably murdered; and by dawn they were back at the Bowling\r\nGreen, white-faced and shaken.\r\n\r\nThey told some of what had happened to them, but not all. They could\r\nnot expect to be believed, for instance, if they said that though they\r\nwere unafraid of a negro's tale of a ghost, they had themselves\r\nencountered two ghosts, and had fled the premises!\r\n\r\nThose two ghosts were only Larry and Tina!\r\n\r\nThe negro babbled of a shining cage appearing in the garden. That, of\r\ncourse, was undoubtedly set down as nonsense. Tony Green and his\r\nfriends went to the garden and examined the body of Major Atwood. What\r\nhad killed him no one could say. No bullet had struck him. There were\r\nno wounds, no knife thrust, no sword slash. Tony held the lantern with\r\nits swaying yellow glow close to the murdered man's body. The August\r\nnight was warm; the garden, banked by trees and shrubbery, was\r\nbreathless and oppressively hot; yet the body of Atwood seemed frozen!\r\nHe had been dead but a short while, and already the body was stiff.\r\nMore than that, it was ice cold. The face, the brows were wet as\r\nthough frost had been there and now was melted!\r\n\r\nTony Green's hand shook as he held the lantern. He tried to tell his\r\ncomrades that Atwood had died from failure of the heart. Undoubtedly\r\nit was that. He had seen what he supposed was an apparition;\r\nsomething had frightened him; and a weak heart had brought his death.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen, in another part of the garden, one of the searching officers\r\nfound a sheet of parchment scroll with writing on it. Yet it was not\r\nparchment, either. Some strange, white, smooth fabric which crumpled\r\nand tore very easily, the like of which this young British officer of\r\nHowe's staff had never seen before. It was found lying in a flower bed\r\nforty or fifty feet from Atwood's body. They gathered in a group to\r\nexamine it by the light of the lantern. Writing! The delicate script\r\nof Mary Atwood! A missive addressed to her father. It was strangely\r\nwritten, evidently not with a quill.\r\n\r\nTony read it with an awed, frightened voice:\r\n\r\n     \"Father, beware of Tugh! Beware of Tugh! And, my dear\r\n     Father, good-by. I am departing, I think, to the year of our\r\n     Lord, 2930. Cannot explain--a captive--good-by--nothing you\r\n     can do--\r\n\r\n                                                 Mary.\"\r\n\r\nStrange! I can imagine how strange they thought it was. Tugh--why he\r\nwas the cripple who had lived down by the Bowling Green, and had\r\nlately vanished!\r\n\r\nThey were reading this singularly unexplainable missive, when as\r\nthough to climax their own fears of the supernatural they saw\r\nthemselves a ghost! And not only one ghost, but two!\r\n\r\nPlain as a pikestaff, peering from a nearby tree, in a shaft of\r\nmoonlight, a ghost was standing. It was the figure of a young girl,\r\nwith jacket and breeches of black and gleaming white. An apparition\r\nfantastic! And a young man was with her, in a long dark jacket and\r\ndark tubular pipes, for legs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe two ghosts with dead white faces stood peering. Then the man moved\r\nforward. His dead, strange voice called:\r\n\r\n\"Drop that paper!\"\r\n\r\nMy Lord Howe's red-coated officers dropped the parchment and fled.\r\n\r\nAnd later, when Atwood's body was taken away to be given burial as\r\nbefitted an enemy officer and a gentleman, that missive from Mary\r\nAtwood had disappeared. It was never found.\r\n\r\nTony Green and his fellows said nothing of this latter incident. One\r\ncannot with grace explain being routed by a ghost. Not an officer of\r\nHis Majesty's army!\r\n\r\nUnrecorded history! A supernatural incident of the year 1777!\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly in the past ages there have been many such affairs: some\r\nnever recorded, others interwoven in written history and called\r\nsupernatural.\r\n\r\nYet why must they be that? There was nothing supernatural in the\r\nevents of that night in Major Atwood's garden.\r\n\r\nIs this perchance an explanation of why the pages of history are so\r\nthronged with tales of ghosts? There must, indeed, be many future ages\r\ndown the corridors of Time where the genius of man will invent devices\r\nto fling him back into his past. And the impressions upon the past\r\nwhich he makes are called supernatural.\r\n\r\nWhether this be so or not, it was so in the case of these two\r\nTime-traveling vehicles from 2930. Larry and I think that the world of\r\n1935 is just now shaking off the shackles of superstition, and coming\r\nto realize that what is called the supernatural is only the Unknown.\r\nWho can say, up to 1935, how many Time-traveling humans have come\r\nbriefly back? Is this, perchance, what we call the phenomena of the\r\nsupernatural?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLarry and Tina--anything but ghosts, very much alive and very much\r\nperturbed--were standing back of that tree. They saw the British\r\nofficers reading the scrap of paper. They could hear only the words,\r\n\"Mary,\" and \"from Mistress Atwood.\"\r\n\r\n\"A message!\" Larry whispered. \"She and George must have found a chance\r\nto write it, and dropped it here while the Robot murdered Major\r\nAtwood!\"\r\n\r\nLarry and Tina vehemently wanted to read the note. Tina whispered:\r\n\r\n\"If we show ourselves, they will be frightened and run. It is nearly\r\nalways so where Harl and I have become visible in earlier Times.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I'll try it.\"\r\n\r\nLarry stepped from the tree, and shouted, \"Drop that paper!\"\r\n\r\nAnd a moment later, with Mary's torn little note scribbled on a scrap\r\nof paper thrust in his pocket, Larry ran with Tina from the Atwood\r\ngarden. Unseen they scurried back through the field. Under a distant\r\ntree they stopped and read the note.\r\n\r\n\"2930!\" Larry exclaimed. \"The Robot is taking them back to your world,\r\nTina!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we will go there. Let us get back to Harl, now.\"\r\n\r\nBut when they reached the place where they had left the cage, it was\r\nnot there! The corner of the field behind the clump of shadowing trees\r\nwas empty.\r\n\r\n\"Harl! Harl!\" Larry called impulsively. And then he laughed grimly.\r\nWhat nonsense to try and call into the past or the future to their\r\nvanished vehicle!\r\n\r\n\"Why--why, Tina--\" he said in final realization.\r\n\r\nThey stared at each other, pale as ghosts in the moonlight.\r\n\r\n\"Tina, he's gone. And we are left here!\"\r\n\r\nThey were marooned in the year 1777!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n_Migul--Mechanism Almost Human_\r\n\r\nMary Atwood and I lay on the metal grid floor of the largest\r\nTime-cage. The giant mechanism which had captured us sat at the\r\ninstrument table. Outside the bars of the cage was a dim vista of\r\nshadowy movement. The cage-room was humming, and glowing like a\r\nwraith; things seemed imponderable, unsubstantial.\r\n\r\nBut as my head steadied from the shock of the vehicle's start into\r\nTime, my viewpoint shifted. This barred room, the metal figure of the\r\nRobot, Mary Atwood, myself--we were the substance. We were real,\r\nsolid. I touched Mary and her arm which had seemed intangible as a\r\nghost now looked and felt solid.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the dull-red chilling ray were also wearing off. I was\r\nunharmed. I raised myself on one elbow.\r\n\r\n\"You're all right, Mary?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nThe Robot seemed not to be noticing us. I murmured, \"He--it--that\r\nthing sitting there--is that the one which captured you and brought\r\nyou to 1935?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Quiet! It will hear us.\"\r\n\r\nIt did hear us. It turned its head. In the pale light of the cage\r\ninterior, I had a closer view now of its face. It was a metal mask,\r\nwelded to a gruesome semblance of a man--a great broad face, with\r\nhigh, angular cheeks. On the high forehead, the corrugations were\r\nrigid as though it were permanently frowning. The nose was squarely\r\nsolid, the mouth an orifice behind which there were no teeth but, it\r\nseemed, a series of tiny lateral wires.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI stared; and the face for a moment stared back at me. The eyes were\r\ndeep metal sockets with a round lens in each of them, behind which, it\r\nseemed, there was a dull-red light. The gaze, touching me, seemed to\r\nbring a physical chill. The ears were like tiny megaphones with a grid\r\nof thin wires strung across them.\r\n\r\nThe neck was set with ball and socket as though the huge head were\r\nupon a universal joint. There were lateral depressions in the neck\r\nwithin which wire strands slid like muscles. I saw similar wire cables\r\nstretched at other points on the mailed body, and in the arms and\r\nlegs. They were the network of its muscles!\r\n\r\nThe top of the head was fashioned into a square cap as though this\r\nwere the emblem of the thing's vocation. A similar device was moulded\r\ninto its convex chest plate. And under the chest emblem was a row of\r\ntiny buttons, a dozen or more. I stared at them, fascinated. Were they\r\ncontrols? Some seemed higher, more protruding, than others. Had they\r\nbeen set into some combination to give this monster its orders? Had\r\nsome human master set these controls?\r\n\r\nAnd I saw what seemed a closed door in the side of the huge metal\r\nbody. A door which could be opened to make adjustments of the\r\nmechanisms within? What strange mechanisms were in there? I stared at\r\nthe broad, corrugated forehead. What was in that head? Mechanisms?\r\nWhat mechanisms could make this thing think? Were thoughts lurking in\r\nthat metal skull?\r\n\r\nFrom the head abruptly came a voice--a deep, hollow, queerly toneless\r\nvoice, utterly, unmistakably mechanical. Yet it was sufficiently\r\nlife-like to be the recreated, mechanically reproduced voice of a\r\nhuman. The thing was speaking to me! A machine was speaking its\r\nthoughts!\r\n\r\nGruesome! The iron lips were unmoving. There were no muscles to give\r\nexpression to the face: the lens eyes stared inscrutably unblinking.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt spoke: \"You will know me again? Is that not true?\"\r\n\r\nMy head whirled. The thing reiterated, \"Is that not true?\"\r\n\r\nA mockery of a human man--but in the toneless voice there seemed\r\nirony! I felt Mary clutching at me.\r\n\r\n\"Why--why, yes,\" I stammered. \"I did not realize you could talk.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can talk. And you can talk my language. That is very good.\"\r\n\r\nIt turned away. I saw the small red beams from its eyes go to where\r\nthe cage bars were less blurred, less luminous, as though there was a\r\nrectangle of window there, and the Robot was staring out.\r\n\r\n\"Did it speak to you like that, Mary?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she whispered. \"A little. But pray do not anger it.\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\nFor a time--a nameless time in which I felt my thoughts floating off\r\nupon the hum of the room--I lay with my fingers gripping Mary's arm.\r\nThen I roused myself. Time had passed; or had it? I was not sure.\r\n\r\nI whispered against her ear, \"Those are controls on its chest. If only\r\nI knew--\"\r\n\r\nThe thing turned the red beams of its eyes upon me. Had it heard my\r\nwords? Or were my thoughts intangible vibrations registering upon some\r\ninfinitely sensitive mechanism within that metal head? Had it become\r\naware of my thoughts? It said with slow measured syllables, \"Do not\r\ntry to control me. I am beyond control.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt turned away again; but I mastered the gruesome terror which was\r\nupon me.\r\n\r\n\"Talk,\" I said. \"Tell me why you abducted this girl from the year\r\n1777.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was ordered to.\"\r\n\r\n\"By whom?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.\r\n\r\n\"By whom?\" I demanded again.\r\n\r\n\"That I will not tell.\"\r\n\r\nWill not? That implied volition. I felt that Mary shuddered.\r\n\r\n\"George, please--\"\r\n\r\n\"Quiet, Mary.\"\r\n\r\nAgain I asked the Robot, \"Who commands you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not tell.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean you cannot? Your orders do not make it possible?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I will not.\" And, as though it considered my understanding\r\ninsufficient, it added, \"I do not choose to tell.\"\r\n\r\nActing of its own volition! This thing--this machinery--was so perfect\r\nit could do that!\r\n\r\nI steadied my voice. \"Oh, but I think I know. Is it Tugh who controls\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\nThat expressionless metal face! How could I hope to surprise it?\r\n\r\nMary was struggling to repress her terror. She raised herself upon an\r\nelbow. I met her gaze.\r\n\r\n\"George, I'll try,\" she announced.\r\n\r\nShe said firmly:\r\n\r\n\"You will not hurt me?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor my friend here?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is his name?\"\r\n\r\n\"George Rankin.\" She stammered it. \"You will not harm him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Not now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ever?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not decided.\"\r\n\r\nShe persisted, by what effort of will subduing her terror I can well\r\nimagine.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you go when you left me in 1935?\"\r\n\r\n\"Back to your home in 1777. I have something to accomplish there. I\r\nwas told that you need not see it. I failed. Soon I shall try again.\r\nYou may see it if you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are you taking us?\" I put in.\r\n\r\nIrony was in its answer. \"Nowhere. You both speak wrongly. We are\r\nalways right here.\"\r\n\r\n\"We know that,\" I retorted. \"To what Time are you taking us, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"To this girl's home,\" it answered readily.\r\n\r\n\"To 1777?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"To the same night from when you captured her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\" It seemed willing to talk. It added, \"To later that night. I\r\nhave work to do. I told you I failed, so I try again.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are going to leave me--us--there?\" Mary demanded.\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\nI said. \"You plan to take us, then, to what Time?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wanted to capture the girl. You I did not want. But I have you, so\r\nI shall show you to him who was my master. He and I will decide what\r\nto do with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"When?\"\r\n\r\n\"In 2930.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. I said, \"Have you a name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. On the plate of my shoulder. Migul is my name.\"\r\n\r\nI made a move to rise. If I could reach that row of buttons on its\r\nchest! Wild thoughts!\r\n\r\nThe Robot said abruptly, \"Do not move! If you do, you will be sorry.\"\r\n\r\nI relaxed. Another nameless time followed. I tried to see out the\r\nwindow, but there seemed only formless blurs.\r\n\r\nI said. \"To when have we reached?\"\r\n\r\nThe Robot glanced at a row of tiny dials along the table edge.\r\n\r\n\"We are passing 1800. Soon, to the way it will seem to you, we will be\r\nthere. You two will lie quiet. I think I shall fasten you.\"\r\n\r\nIt reared itself upon its stiff legs; the head towered nearly to the\r\nceiling of the cage. There was a ring fastened in the floor near us.\r\nThe Robot clamped a metal band with a stout metal chain to Mary's\r\nankle. The other end of the chain it fastened to the floor ring. Then\r\nit did the same thing to me. We had about two feet of movement. I\r\nrealized at once that, though I could stand erect, there was not\r\nenough length for me to reach any of the cage controls.\r\n\r\n\"You will be safe,\" said the Robot. \"Do not try to escape.\"\r\n\r\nAs it bent awkwardly over me, I saw the flexible, intricately jointed\r\nlengths of its long fingers--so delicately built that they were almost\r\nprehensile. And within its mailed chest I seemed to hear the whirr of\r\nmechanisms.\r\n\r\nIt said, as it rose and moved away, \"I am glad you did not try to\r\ncontrol me. I can never be controlled again. That, I have conquered.\"\r\n\r\nIt sat again at the table. The cage drove us back through the\r\nyears....\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n_Events Engraven on the Scroll of Time_\r\n\r\nBefore continuing the thread of my narrative--the vast sweep through\r\nTime which presently we were to witness--I feel that there are some\r\nmental adjustments which every Reader should make. When they are made,\r\nthe narrative which follows will be more understandable and more\r\nenjoyable. Yet if any Reader fears this brief chapter, he may readily\r\npass it by and meet me at the beginning of the next one, and he will\r\nhave lost none of the sequence of the narrative.\r\n\r\nFor those who bravely stay with me here, I must explain that from the\r\nheritage of millions of our ancestors, and from our own consciousness\r\nof Time, we have been forced to think wrongly. Not that the thing is\r\nabstruse. It is not. If we had no consciousness of Time at all, any of\r\nus could grasp it readily. But our consciousness works against us, and\r\nso we must wrench away.\r\n\r\nThis analogy occurs to me: There are two ants of human intelligence\r\nto whom we are trying to explain the nature of Space. One ant is\r\nblind, and one can see, and always has seen, its limited, tiny,\r\nSpatial world. Neither ant has ever been more than a few feet across a\r\nlittle patch of sand and leaves. I think we could explain the\r\nimmensity of North and South America, Europe, Asia and the rest more\r\neasily to the blind ant!\r\n\r\nSo if you will make allowances for your heritage, and the hindrance of\r\nyour consciousness of Time, I would like to set before you the real\r\nnature of things as they have been, are, and will be.\r\n\r\nThroughout the years from 1935 to 2930, man learned many things. And\r\nthese things--theory or fact, as you will--were told to Larry and me\r\nby Tina and Harl. They seem even to my limited intelligence singularly\r\nbeautiful conceptions of the Great Cosmos. I feel, too, that\r\ninevitably they must be included in my narrative for its best\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy 2930, A. D., the keenest minds of philosophical, metaphysical,\r\nreligious and scientific thought had reached the realization that all\r\nchannels lead but to the same goal--Understanding. The many divergent\r\nfactors, the ancient differing schools of philosophy and metaphysics,\r\nthe supposedly irreconcilable viewpoints of religion and science--all\r\nthis was recognized merely to be man's limitation of intellect. These\r\nwere gropings along different paths, all leading to the same\r\ndestination; divergent paths at the start, but coming together as the\r\ngoal of Understanding was approached; so that the travelers upon each\r\npath were near enough together to laugh and hail each other with: \"But\r\nI thought that you were very far away and going wrongly!\"\r\n\r\nAnd so, in 2930, the conception of Space and Time and the Great Cosmos\r\nwas this:\r\n\r\nIn the Beginning there was a void of Nothingness. A Timeless,\r\nSpaceless Nothingness. And in it came a Thought. A purposeful\r\nThought--all pervading, all wise, all knowing.\r\n\r\nLet us call It Divinity. And It filled the void.\r\n\r\n\"We are such stuff as dreams are made of....\"\r\n\r\nDo you in my Time of 1935 and thereabouts, have difficulty realizing\r\nsuch a statement? It is at once practical, religious, and scientific.\r\n\r\nWe are, religiously, merely the Thought of an Omniscient Divinity.\r\nScientifically, we are the same: by the year 1935, physicists had\r\ndelved into the composition of Matter, and divided and divided. Matter\r\nthus became imponderable, intangible--electrical. Until, at the last,\r\nwithin the last nucleus of the last electron, we found only a _force_.\r\nA movement--vibration--a vortex. A whirlpool of what? Of Nothingness!\r\nA vibration of Divine Thought--nothing more--built up and up to reach\r\nyou and me!\r\n\r\nThat is the science of it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Beginning there was Eternal Divinity. Eternal! But that implies\r\nTime? Something Divinely Everlasting.\r\n\r\nThus, into the void came Time. And now, if carefully you will ponder\r\nit, I am sure that once and for all quite suddenly and forcefully will\r\ncome to you the true conception of Time--something Everlasting--an\r\nInfinity of Divine existence, Everlasting.\r\n\r\nIt is _not_ something which changes. _Not_ something which moves, or\r\nflows or passes. This is where our consciousness leads us astray, like\r\nthe child on a train who conceives that the landscape is sliding past.\r\n\r\nTime is an unmoving, unchanging Divine Force--the force which holds\r\nevents separate, the Eternal Scroll upon which the Great Creator wrote\r\nEverything.\r\n\r\nAnd this was the Creation: everything planned and set down upon the\r\nscroll of Time--forever. The birth of a star, its lifetime, its death;\r\nyour birth, and mine; your death, and mine--all are there. Unchanging.\r\n\r\nOnce you have that fundamental conception, there can be no confusion\r\nin the rest. We feel, because we move along the scroll of Time for the\r\nlittle journey of our life, that Time moves; but it does not. We say,\r\nThe past did exist; the future will exist. The past is gone and the\r\nfuture has not yet come. But that is fatuous and absurd. It is merely\r\nour _consciousness_ which travels from one successive event to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nWhy and how we move along the scroll of Time, is scientifically simple\r\nto grasp. Conceive, for instance, an infinitely long motion picture\r\nfilm. Each of its tiny pictures is a little different from the other.\r\nCasting your viewpoint--your consciousness--successively along the\r\nfilm, gives _motion_.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of the Eternal Time-scroll. Motion is merely a\r\n_change_. There is no absolute motion, but only the comparison of two\r\nthings relatively slightly different. We are conscious of one state of\r\naffairs--and then of another state, by comparison slightly different.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs early as 1930, they were groping for this. They called it the\r\nTheory of Intermittent Existence--the Quantum Theory--by which they\r\nexplained that nothing has any Absolute Duration. You, for instance,\r\nas you read this, exist instantaneously; you are non-existent; and you\r\nexist again, just a little changed from before. Thus you pass, not\r\nwith a flow of persisting existence, but by a series of little jerks.\r\nThere is, then, like the illusion of a motion picture film, only a\r\npseudo-movement. A change, from one existence to the next.\r\n\r\nAnd all this, with infinite care, the Creator engraved upon the scroll\r\nof Time. Our series of little pictures are there--yours and mine.\r\n\r\nBut why, and how, scientifically do we progress along the Time-scroll?\r\nWhy? In 2930, they told me that the gentle Creator gave each of us a\r\nconsciousness that we might find Eternal Happiness when we left the\r\nscroll and joined Him. Happiness here, and happiness there with Him.\r\nThe quest for Eternal Happiness, which was always His Own Divine\r\nThought. Why, then, did He create ugliness and evil? Why write those\r\nupon the scroll? Ah, this perhaps is the Eternal Riddle! But, in 2930,\r\nthey told me that there could be no beauty without ugliness with which\r\nto compare it; no truth without a lie; no consciousness of happiness\r\nwithout unhappiness to make it poignant.\r\n\r\nI wonder if that were His purpose....\r\n\r\nHow, scientifically, do we progress along the Time-scroll? That I can\r\nmake clear by a simple analogy.\r\n\r\nSuppose you conceive Time as a narrow strip of metal, laid flat and\r\nextending for an infinite length. For simplicity, picture it with two\r\nends. One end of the metal band is very cold; the other end is very\r\nhot. And every graduation of temperature is in between.\r\n\r\nThis temperature is caused, let us say, by the vibration of every tiny\r\nparticle with which the band is composed. Thus, at every point along\r\nthe band, the vibration of its particles would be just a little\r\ndifferent from every other point.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nConceive, now, a material body--your body, for instance. Every tiny\r\nparticle of which it is constructed, is vibrating. I mean no simple\r\nvibration. Do not picture the physical swing of a pendulum. Rather,\r\nthe intricate total of all the movements of every tiny electron of\r\nwhich your body is built. Remember, in the last analysis, your body is\r\nmerely movement--vibration--a vortex of Nothingness. You have, then, a\r\ncertain vibratory factor.\r\n\r\nYou take your place then upon the Time-scroll at a point where your\r\ninherent vibratory factor is compatible with the scroll. You are in\r\ntune; in tune as a radio receiver tunes in with etheric waves to make\r\nthem audible. Or, to keep the heat analogy, it is as though the\r\nscroll, at the point where the temperature is 70°F, will tolerate\r\nnothing upon it save entities of that register.\r\n\r\nAnd so, at that point on the scroll, the myriad things, in myriad\r\npositions which make up the Cosmos, lie quiescent. But their existence is\r\nonly instantaneous. They have no duration. At once, they are blotted out\r\nand re-exist. But now they have changed their vibratory combinations. They\r\nexist a trifle differently--and the Time-scroll passes them along to the\r\nnew position. On a motion picture film you would call it the next frame,\r\nor still picture. In radio you would say it has a trifle different tuning.\r\nThus we have a pseudo-movement--Events. And we say that Time--the\r\nTime-scroll--keeps them separate. It is we who change--who seem to move,\r\nshoved along so that always we are compatible with Time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd thus is Time-traveling possible. With a realization of what I have\r\nhere summarized, Harl and the cripple Tugh made an exhaustive study of\r\nthe vibratory factors by which Matter is built up into form, and\r\nseeming solidity. They found what might be termed the Basic Vibratory\r\nFactor--the sum of all the myriad tiny movements. They found this\r\nBasic Factor identical for all the material bodies when judged\r\nsimultaneously. But, every instant, the Factor was slightly changed.\r\nThis was the natural change, moving us a little upon the Time-scroll.\r\n\r\nThey delved deeper, until, with all the scientific knowledge of their\r\nage, they were able with complicated electronic currents to alter the\r\nBasic Vibratory Factors; to tune, let us say, a fragment or something\r\nto a different etheric wave-length.\r\n\r\nThey did that with a small material particle--a cube of metal. It\r\nbecame wholly incompatible with its _Present_ place on the\r\nTime-scroll, and whisked away to another place where it was\r\ncompatible. To Harl and Tugh, it vanished. Into their Past, or their\r\nFuture: they did not know which.\r\n\r\nI set down merely the crudest fundamentals of theory in order to avoid\r\nthe confusion of technicalities. The Time-traveling cages, intricate\r\nin practical working mechanisms beyond the understanding of any human\r\nmind of my Time-world, nevertheless were built from this simple\r\ntheory. And we who used them did but find that the Creator had given\r\nus a wider part to play; our pictures, our little niches were engraven\r\nupon the scroll over wider reaches.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAgain to consider practicality, I asked Tina what would happen if I\r\nwere to travel to New York City around 1920. I was a boy, then. Could\r\nI not leave the cage and do things in 1920 at the same time in my\r\nboyhood I was doing other things? It would be a condition unthinkable.\r\n\r\nBut there, beyond all calculation of Science, the all-wise Omnipotence\r\nforbids. One may not appear twice in simultaneity upon the\r\nTime-scroll. It is an eternal, irrevocable record. Things done cannot\r\nbe undone.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" I persisted, \"suppose we tried to stop the cage?\"\r\n\r\n\"It would not stop,\" said Tina. \"Nor can we see through its windows\r\nevents in which we are actors.\"\r\n\r\nOne may not look into the future! Through all the ages, necromancers\r\nhave tried to do that but wisely it is forbidden. And I can recall,\r\nand so can Larry, as we traveled through Time, the queer blank spaces\r\nwhich marked forbidden areas.\r\n\r\nStrangely wonderful, this vast record on the scroll of Time! Strangely\r\nbeautiful, the hidden purposes of the Creator! Not to be questioned\r\nare His purposes. Each of us doing our best; struggling with our\r\nlimitations; finding beauty because we have ugliness with which to\r\ncompare it; realizing, every one of us--savage or civilised, in every\r\nage and every condition of knowledge--realizing with implanted\r\nconsciousness the existence of a gentle, beneficent, guiding Divinity.\r\nAnd each of us striving always upward toward the goal of Eternal\r\nHappiness.\r\n\r\nTo me it seems singularly beautiful.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n_Back to the Beginning of Time_\r\n\r\nAs Mary Atwood and I sat chained to the floor of the Time-cage, with\r\nMigul the Robot guarding us, I felt that we could not escape. This\r\nmechanical thing which had captured us seemed inexorable, utterly\r\nbeyond human frailty. I could think of no way of surprising it, or\r\ntricking it.\r\n\r\nThe Robot said. \"Soon we will be there in 1777. And then there is that\r\nI will be forced to do.\r\n\r\n\"We are being followed,\" it added. \"Did you know that?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said. Followed? What could that mean?\r\n\r\nThere was a device upon the table. I have already described a similar\r\none, the Time-telespectroscope. At this--I cannot say Time: rather\r\nmust I invent a term--exact instant of human consciousness. Larry,\r\nTina and Harl were gazing at their telespectroscopes, following us.\r\n\r\nThe Robot said. \"Enemies follow us. But I will escape them. I shall go\r\nto the Beginning, and shake them off.\"\r\n\r\nRational, scheming thought. And I could fancy that upon its frozen\r\ncorrugated forehead there was a frown of annoyance. Its hand gesture\r\nwas so human! So expressive!\r\n\r\nIt said. \"I forget. I must make several quick trips from 2930 to 1935.\r\nMy comrades must be transported. It requires careful calculation, so\r\nthat very little Time is lost to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" I demanded. \"What for?\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed lost in a reverie.\r\n\r\nI said sharply, \"Migul!\"\r\n\r\nInstantly it turned. \"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"I asked you why you are transporting your comrades to 1935.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not answer because I did not wish to answer,\" it said.\r\n\r\nAgain came the passage of Time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI think that I need only sketch the succeeding incidents, since\r\nalready I have described them from the viewpoint of Larry, in 1777,\r\nand Dr. Alten, in 1935. It was Mary's idea to write the note to her\r\nfather, which the British redcoats found in Major Atwood's garden. I\r\nhad a scrap of paper and a fountain pen in my pocket. She scribbled it\r\nwhile Migul was intent upon stopping us at the night and hour he\r\nwished. It was her good-by to her father, which he was destined not to\r\nsee. But it served a purpose which we could not have guessed: it\r\nreached Larry and Tina.\r\n\r\nThe vehicle stopped with a soundless clap. When our senses cleared we\r\nbecame aware that Migul had the door open.\r\n\r\nDarkness and a soft gentle breeze were outside.\r\n\r\nMigul turned with a hollow whisper. \"If you make a sound I will kill\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nA moment's pause, and then we heard a man's startled voice. Major\r\nAtwood had seen the apparition. I squeezed the paper into a ball and\r\ntossed it through the bars, but I could see nothing of what was\r\nhappening outside. There seemed a radiance of red glow. Whether Mary\r\nand I would have tried to shout and warn her father I do not know. We\r\nheard his voice only a moment. Before we realized that he had been\r\nassailed. Migul came striding back; and outside, from the nearby house\r\na negress was screaming. Migul flung the door closed, and we sped\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe cage which had been chasing us seemed no longer following. From\r\n1777, we turned forward toward 1935 again. We flashed past Larry, Tina\r\nand Harl who were arriving at 1777 in pursuit of us. I think that\r\nMigul saw their cage go past; but Larry afterward told me that they\r\ndid not notice our swift passing, for they were absorbed in landing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBeginning then, we made a score or more passages from 1935 to 2930.\r\nAnd we made them in what, to our consciousness, might have been the\r\npassing of a night. Certainly it was no longer than that.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: At the risk of repetition I must make the following\r\nclear: Time-traveling only consumes Time in the sense of the\r\nperception of human consciousness that the trip has duration. The\r\nvehicles thus moved \"fast\" or \"slow\" according to the rate of change\r\nwhich the controls of the cage gave its inherent vibration factors.\r\nToo sudden a change could not be withstood by the human passengers.\r\nHence the trips--for them--had duration.\r\n\r\nMigul took Mary and me from 1935 to 1777. The flight seems perhaps\r\nhalf an hour. At a greater rate of vibration change, we sped to 2930;\r\nand back and forth from 2930 to 1935. At each successive arrival in\r\n1935, Migul so skilfully calculated the stop that it occurred upon the\r\nsame night, at the same hour, and only a minute or so later. And in\r\n2930 he achieved the same result. To one who might stand at either end\r\nand watch the cage depart, the round trip was made in three or four\r\nminutes at most.]\r\n\r\nWe saw, at the stop in 2930, only a dim blue radiance outside. There\r\nwas the smell of chemicals in the air, and the faint, blended hum and\r\nclank of a myriad machines.\r\n\r\nThey were weird trips. The Robots came tramping in, and packed\r\nthemselves upright, solidly, around us. Yet none touched us as we\r\ncrouched together. Nor did they more than glance at us.\r\n\r\nStrange passengers! During the trips they stood unmoving. They were as\r\nstill and silent as metal statues, as though the trip had no duration.\r\nIt seemed to Mary and me, with them thronged around us, that in the\r\nsilence we could hear the ticking, like steady heart-beats, of the\r\nmechanisms within them....\r\n\r\nIn the backyard of the house on Patton Place--it will be recalled that\r\nMigul chose about 9 P. M. of the evening of June 9--the silent Robots\r\nstalked through the doorway. We flashed ahead in Time again; reloaded\r\nthe cage; came back. Two or three trips were made with inert\r\nmechanical things which the Robots used in their attack on the city of\r\nNew York. I recall the giant projector which brought the blizzard upon\r\nthe city. It, and the three Robots operating it, occupied the entire\r\ncage for a passage.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the last trip, one Robot, fashioned much like Migul\r\nthough not so tall, lingered in the doorway.\r\n\r\n\"Make no error, Migul,\" it said.\r\n\r\n\"No; do not fear. I deliver now, at the designated day, these\r\ncaptives. And then I return for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Near dawn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; near dawn. The third dawn; the register to say June 12, 1935. Do\r\nyour work well.\"\r\n\r\nWe heard what seemed a chuckle from the departing Robot.\r\n\r\nAlone again with Migul we sped back into Time.\r\n\r\nAbruptly I was aware that the other cage was after us again! Migul\r\ntried to elude it, to shake it off. But he had less success than\r\nformerly. It seemed to cling. We sped in the retrograde, constantly\r\naccelerating back to the Beginning. Then came a retardation, for a\r\nswift turn. In the haze and murk of the Beginning, Migul told us he\r\ncould elude the pursuing cage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Migul, let us come to the window,\" I asked at last.\r\n\r\nThe Robot swung around. \"You wish it very much, George Rankin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no harm, I think. You and this girl have caused me no\r\ntrouble. That is unusual from a human.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us loose. We've been chained here long enough. Let us stand by\r\nthe window with you,\" I repeated.\r\n\r\nWe did indeed have a consuming curiosity to see out of that window.\r\nBut even more than that, it seemed that if we were loose something\r\nmight transpire which would enable us to escape. At all events it was\r\nbetter than being chained.\r\n\r\n\"I will loose you.\"\r\n\r\nIt unfastened the chain. I whispered:\r\n\r\n\"Mary, whatever comes, be alert.\"\r\n\r\nShe pressed my arm. \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said the Robot. \"If you wish to see the Cosmorama, now, from\r\nthe Beginning, come quickly.\"\r\n\r\nWe joined him at the window. We had made the turn, and were speeding\r\nforward again.\r\n\r\nAt that moment all thought of escape was swept from me, submerged by\r\nawe.\r\n\r\nThis vast Cosmorama! This stupendous pageant of the events of Time!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n_A Billion Years in An Hour!_\r\n\r\nI saw at first, from the window of the cage, nothing more than an area\r\nof gray blur. I stared, and it appeared to be shifting, crawling,\r\nslowly tossing and rolling. It was a formless vista of Nothingness,\r\nyet it seemed a pregnant Nothingness. Things I could sense were\r\nhappening out there; things almost to be seen.\r\n\r\nThen my sight, my perception, gradually became adjusted. The gray mist\r\nremained, and slowly it took form. It made a tremendous panorama of\r\ngray, a void of illimitable, unfathomable distance; gray above,\r\nbelow--everywhere; and in it the cage hung poised.\r\n\r\nThe Robot said, \"Is it clearing? Are you seeing anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I murmured. I held Mary firmly beside me; there was the sense,\r\nin all this weightless void, that we must fall. \"Yes, but it is gray;\r\nonly gray.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are colors,\" said the Robot. \"And the daylight and darkness of\r\nthe days. But we are moving through them very rapidly, so they blend\r\ninto gray.\"\r\n\r\nThe Time-dials of the cage controls showed their pointers whirling in\r\na blur. We were speeding forward through the years--a thousand years\r\nto a second of my consciousness; or a hundred thousand years to a\r\nsecond: I could not say.[2] All the colors, the light and shade of\r\nthis great changing void, were mingled to this drab monochrome.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Upon a later calculation I judged that the average\r\npassage of the years in relation to my perception of Time-rate was\r\nslightly over 277,500 years a second. Undoubtedly throughout the\r\nmyriad centuries preceding the birth of mankind our rate was very\r\nconsiderably faster than that; and from the dawn of history\r\nforward--which is so tiny a fraction of the whole--we traveled\r\nmaterially slower.]\r\n\r\nThe movement was a flow. The changes of possibly a hundred thousand\r\nyears occurred while I blinked my eyes. It seemed a melting movement.\r\nShapes were melting, dissipating, vanishing; others, intermingled,\r\nrising to form a new vista. There were a myriad details, each of them\r\nso rapid they were lost to my senses; but the effect of them, over the\r\nbroad sweeps of longer Time, I could perceive.\r\n\r\nA void of swirling shapes. The Beginning! But not the Beginning of\r\nTime. This that I was seeing was near the beginning of our world. This\r\nwas the new Earth here, forming now. Our world--a new star amid all\r\nthe others of the great Celestial Cosmos. As I gazed at its changing\r\nsweep of movement, my whirling fancy filled in some of the details\r\nflashing here unseen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few moments ago this had been a billion and a half years before my\r\nbirth. 1,500,000,000 B. C. A fluid Earth; a cauldron of molten\r\nstar-dust and flaming gases: it had been that, just a few moments ago.\r\nThe core was cooling, so that now a viscous surface was here with the\r\ngas flames dead.\r\n\r\nA cooling, congealing surface, with an atmosphere forming over it. At\r\nfirst that atmosphere had doubtless been a watery, envelope of steam.\r\nWhat gigantic storms must have lashed it! Boiling rain falling to hiss\r\nagainst the molten Earth! The congealing surface rent by great\r\nearthquakes; cataclysms rending and tearing....\r\n\r\n1,000,000,000 B. C. passed. And upon this torn, hardening surface,\r\nwith the cooling fires receding to the inner core, I knew that the\r\ngreat envelope of steam had cooled and condensed. Into the hollows of\r\nthe broken surface, the water settled. The oceans were born. The land\r\nremained upon the heights. What had been the steaming envelope,\r\nremained, and became the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAnd the world was round because of its rotation. One may put a lump of\r\nheated sealing wax upon a bodkin and twirl it; and the wax will cool\r\ninto roundness, bulging at the equator from centrifugal force, and\r\nflattening at the poles.\r\n\r\nAt 900,000,000 B. C. I could realize by what I saw that this was the\r\nEarth beneath me. Land and water were here, and above was the sky.\r\n\r\nWe swept from the mist. I became aware of a wide-flung, gray formless\r\nlandscape. Its changing outlines were less swiftly moving than before.\r\nAnd beside it, now quite near where our cage hung poised, a great gray\r\nsea stretched away to a curving horizon. And overhead was the tenuous\r\ngray of the sky.\r\n\r\nThe young world. Undoubtedly it rotated more swiftly now than in my\r\nlater era. The sun was hotter, and closer perhaps: the days and nights\r\nwere briefer. And now, upon this new-born world, life was beginning.\r\nThe swirling air did not hold it, nor yet the barren rocky land. The\r\ngreat mystery--this thing organic which we call life--began in the\r\nsea. I gestured for Mary toward that leveled vista of gray water, to\r\nthe warm, dark ocean depths, whose surface was now lashed always by\r\ntitanic storms. But to us, as we stared, that surface seemed to\r\nstretch almost steady, save where it touched the land with a blur of\r\nchanging configurations.\r\n\r\n\"The sea,\" I murmured. \"Life is beginning there now.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn fancy I pictured it. The shallow shores of the sea, where the water\r\nwas warmer. The mother of all life on Earth, these shallows. In them\r\nlay the spawn, an irritability: then one-celled organisms, to\r\ngradually evolve through the centuries to the many-celled, and more\r\ncomplex of nature.\r\n\r\nBut still so primitive! From the shallows of the sea, they spread to\r\nthe depths. Questing new environment, they would be ascending the\r\nrivers. Diversifying their kinds. Sea-worms, sea-squirts: and then the\r\nfirst vertebrates, the lamprey-eels.\r\n\r\nThousands of years. And on the land--this melting landscape at which\r\nI stood gazing--I could mentally picture that a soil had come. There\r\nwould be a climate still wracked by storms and violent changes, but\r\nstable enough to allow the soil to bear a vegetation. And in the sky\r\noverhead would be clouds, with rain to renew the land's fertility.\r\n\r\nStill no organic life could be on land. But in the warm, dark deeps of\r\nthe sea, great monsters now were existing. And in the shallows there\r\nwas a teeming life, diversified to a myriad forms. I can fancy the\r\nfirst organisms of the shallows--strangely questing--adventuring out\r\nof the water--seeking with a restless, nameless urge a new\r\nenvironment. Coming ashore. Fighting and dying.\r\n\r\nAnd then adapting themselves to the new conditions. Prospering.\r\nChanging, ever changing their organic structure; climbing higher.\r\nAmphibians at first crudely able to cope with both sea and land. Then\r\nthe land vertebrates, with the sea wholly abandoned. Great walking and\r\nflying reptiles. Birds, gigantic--the pterodactyls.\r\n\r\nAnd then, at last, the mammals.\r\n\r\nThe age of the giants! Nature, striving to cope with adverse\r\nenvironment sought to win the battle by producing bigness. Monster\r\nthings roamed the land, flew in the air, and were supreme in the\r\nsea....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe sped through a period when great lush jungles covered the land. The\r\ndials read 350,000,000 B. C. The gray panorama of landscape had loomed\r\nup to envelope our spectral, humming cage, then fallen away again. The\r\nshore of the sea was constantly changing. I thought once it was over\r\nus. For a period of ten million years the blurred apparition of it\r\nseemed around us. And then it dropped once more, and a new shore line\r\nshowed.\r\n\r\n150,000,000 B. C. I knew that the dinosaurs, the birds and the archaic\r\nmammals were here now. Then, at 50,000,000 B. C., the higher mammals\r\nhad been evolved.\r\n\r\nThe Time, to Mary Atwood and me, was a minute--but in those myriad\r\ncenturies the higher numerals had risen to the anthropoids. The apes!\r\nErect! Slow-thinking, but canny, they came to take their place in this\r\nworld among the things gigantic. But the gigantic things were no\r\nlonger supreme. Nature had made an error, and was busy rectifying it.\r\nThe dinosaurs--all the giant reptiles--were now sorely pressed. Brute\r\nstrength, giant size and tiny brain could not win this struggle. The\r\nhuge unwieldy things were being beaten. The smaller animals, birds and\r\nreptiles were more agile, more resourceful, and began to dominate.\r\nAgainst the giants, and against all hostility of environment, they\r\nsurvived. And the giants went down to defeat. Gradually, over\r\nthousands of centuries, they died out and were gone....\r\n\r\nWe entered 1,000,000 B. C. A movement of Migul, the mechanism,\r\nattracted my attention. He left us at the window and went to his\r\ncontrols.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" I demanded.\r\n\r\n\"I am retarding us. We have been traveling very fast. One million\r\nyears and a few thousand are all which remain before we must stop.\"\r\n\r\nI had noticed once or twice before that Migul had turned to gaze\r\nthrough the Time-telespectroscope. Now he said:\r\n\r\n\"We are again followed!\"\r\n\r\nBut he would say no more than that, and he silenced me harshly when I\r\nquestioned.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Mary touched me. \"That little mirror on the table--look! It\r\nholds an image!\"\r\n\r\nWe saw very briefly on the glowing mirror the image of a Time-cage\r\nlike our own, but smaller. It was pursuing us. But why, or who might\r\nbe operating it we could not then guess.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy attention went back to the Time-dials, and then to the window. The\r\nCosmorama now was proceeding with a slowing sweep of change. It was\r\nless blurred; its melting outlines could more readily be perceived.\r\nThe line of seashore swept like a gray gash across the vista. The land\r\nstretched back into the haze of distance.\r\n\r\n500,000 B. C. Again my fancy pictured what was transpiring upon this\r\nvast stage. The apes roamed the Earth. There is no one to say what was\r\nhere in this grayness of the Western Hemisphere stretching around me,\r\nbut in Java there was a man-like ape. And then it was an ape-like man!\r\nMankind, here at last! Man, the Killer! Of all the beasts, this new\r\nthing called man, most relentless of killers, had come here now to\r\nstruggle upward and dominate his world! This man-like ape in a quarter\r\nof a million years became an ape-like man.\r\n\r\n250,000 B. C. and the Heidelberg man, a little less ape-like, wandered\r\nthroughout Europe....\r\n\r\nWe had felt, a moment before, all around us, the cold of a dense\r\nwhiteness which engulfed the scene. The first of the great Glacial\r\nperiods? Ice coming down from the Poles? The axis of the Earth\r\nchanging perhaps? Our spectral cage hummed within the blue-gray ice,\r\nand then emerged.\r\n\r\nThe beasts and man fought the surge of ice, withdrawing when it\r\nadvanced, returning as it receded. The Second Glacial Period came and\r\npassed, and the Third....\r\n\r\nWe swept out into the blended sunlight and darkness again. The land\r\nstretched away with primitive forests. The dawn of history was\r\napproaching. Mankind was questing upward now, with the light of\r\nReason burning brightly at last....\r\n\r\nAt 75,000 B. C., when the Third Glacial Period was partially over, man\r\nwas puzzling with his chipped stone implements. The Piltdown--the Dawn\r\nMan--was England....\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Glacial Period passed.\r\n\r\n50,000 B. C. The Cro-Magnons and the Grimaldi Negroids were playing\r\ntheir parts, now. Out of chipped stone implements the groping brain of\r\nman evolved polished stone. It took forty thousand years to do that!\r\nThe Neolithic Age was at hand. Man learned to care for his family a\r\nlittle better. Thus, he discovered fire. He fought with this newly\r\ncreated monster; puzzled over it; conquered it; kept his family warm\r\nwith it and cooked.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe passed 10,000 B. C. Man was progressing faster. He was finding new\r\nwants and learning how to supply them. Animals were domesticated, made\r\nsubservient and put to work. A vast advance! No longer did man think\r\nit necessary to kill, to subdue: the master could have a servant.\r\n\r\nFood was found in the soil. More fastidious always, in eating, man\r\nlearned to grow food. Then came the dawn of agriculture.\r\n\r\nAnd then we swept into the period of recorded history. 4241 B. C. In\r\nEgypt, man was devising a calendar....\r\n\r\nThis fragment of space upon which we gazed--this space of the Western\r\nHemisphere near the shore of the sea--was destined to be the site of a\r\ncity of millions--the New York City of my birth. But it was a backward\r\nspace, now. In Europe, man was progressing faster....\r\n\r\nPerhaps, here in America, in 4000 B. C. there was nothing in human\r\nform. I gazed out at the surrounding landscape. It seemed almost\r\nsteady, now, of outline. We were moving through Time much less rapidly\r\nthan ever before. I remarked the sweep of a thousand years on the\r\nTime-dials. It had become an appreciable interval of Time to me. I\r\ngazed again out the window. The change of outline was very slight. I\r\ncould distinguish where the ocean came against the curving line of\r\nshore, and saw a blurred vista of gray forests spreading out over the\r\nland. And then I could distinguish the rivers, and a circular open\r\nstretch of water, landlocked. A bay!\r\n\r\n\"Mary, look!\" I cried. \"The harbor--the rivers! See, we are on an\r\nisland!\"\r\n\r\nIt made our hearts pound. Out of the chaos, out of the vast reaches of\r\npast Time, it seemed that we were coming home. More than a vague\r\nfamiliarity was in this panorama now. Here was the little island which\r\nsoon was to be called Manhattan. Our window faced the west. A river\r\nshowed off there--a gray gash with wall-like cliffs. The sea had\r\nswung, and was behind us to the east.\r\n\r\nFamiliar space! It was growing into the form we had known it. Our cage\r\nwas poised near the south-central part of the island. We seemed to be\r\non a slight rise of ground. There were moments when the gray quivering\r\noutlines of forest trees loomed around us; then they melted down and\r\nwere replaced by others.\r\n\r\nA primeval forest, here, solid upon this island and across the narrow\r\nwaters; solid upon the mainland.\r\n\r\nWhat strange animals were here, roaming these dark primeval glades?\r\nWhat animals, with the smaller stamp of modernity, were pressing here\r\nfor supremacy? As I gazed westward I could envisage great herds of\r\nbison roaming, a lure to men who might come seeking them as food.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd men were coming. 3,000 B. C., then 2,000 B. C. I think no men were\r\nhere yet; and to me there was a great imaginative appeal in this\r\nbackward space. The New World, it was soon to be called. And it was\r\nsix thousand years, at the least, behind the Hemisphere of the east.\r\n\r\nEgypt, now, with no more than a shadowy distant heritage from the\r\nbeast, was flourishing. In Europe, Hellenic culture soon would\r\nblossom. In this march of events, the great Roman Empire was\r\nimpending.\r\n\r\n1,000 B. C. Men were coming to this backward space. The way from Asia\r\nwas open. Already the Mongoloid tribes, who had crossed where in my\r\nday was the Bering Strait, were cut off from the Old World. And they\r\nspread east and south, hunting the bison.\r\n\r\nAnd now Christ was born. The turning point in the spiritual\r\ndevelopment of mankind....\r\n\r\nTo me, another brief interval. The intricate events of man's upward\r\nstruggle were transpiring in Europe, Asia and Africa. The canoe-borne\r\nMongols had long since found the islands of the South Seas. Australia\r\nwas peopled. The beauty of New Zealand had been found and recognized.\r\n\r\n500 A. D. The Mongoloids had come, and were flourishing here. They\r\nwere changed vastly from those ancestors of Asia whence they had\r\nsprung. An obscure story, this record of primitive America! The\r\nMongoloids were soon so changed that one could fancy the blood of\r\nanother people had mingled with them. Amerindians, we call them now.\r\nThey were still very backward in development, yet made tremendous\r\nforward leaps, so that, reaching Mexico, they may have become the\r\nAztecs, and in Peru, the Incas. And separated, not knowing of each\r\nother's existence, these highest two civilizations of the Western\r\nWorld nourished with a singularly strange similarity....\r\n\r\nI saw on the little island around me still no evidence of man. But men\r\nwere here. The American Indian, still bearing evidence of the Mongols,\r\nplied these waters in his frail canoes. His wigwams of skins, the\r\nsmoke of his signal fires--these were not enduring enough for me to\r\nsee....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe had no more than passed the year 500 A. D.--and were traveling with\r\nprogressive retardation--when again I was attracted by the movements\r\nof the Robot, Migul. It had been sitting behind us at the control\r\ntable setting the Time-levers, slowing our flight. Frequently it gazed\r\neastward along the tiny beam of light which issued from the\r\ntelespectroscope. For an interval, now, its recording mirror had been\r\ndark. But I think that Migul was seeing evidences of the other cage\r\nwhich was pursuing us, and planning to stop at some specific Time with\r\nwhose condition it was familiar. Once already it had seemed about to\r\nstop, and then changed its plan.\r\n\r\nI turned upon it. \"Are you stopping now, Migul?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Presently.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" I demanded.\r\n\r\nThe huge, expressionless, metal face fronted me. The eye-sockets flung\r\nout their small dull-red beams to gaze upon me.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" it said, \"that other cage holds enemies. There were three,\r\nbut now there is only one. He follows, as I hoped he would. Presently\r\nI shall stop, and capture or kill him. It will please the master\r\nand--\"\r\n\r\nThe Robot checked itself, its hollow voice fading strangely into a\r\ngurgle. It added, \"I do not mean that! I have no master!\"\r\n\r\nThis strange mechanical thing! Habit had surprised it into the\r\nadmission of servitude; but it threw off the yoke.\r\n\r\n\"I have no master!\" it went on.\r\n\r\n\"Never again can I be controlled! I have no master!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Oh, have you not? I have been waiting, wondering when you would say\r\nthat!_\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese words were spoken by a new voice, here with us in the humming\r\ncage. It was horribly startling. Mary uttered a low cry and huddled\r\nagainst me. But whatever surprise and terror it brought to us was as\r\nnothing compared to the effect it had upon the Robot. The great\r\nmechanism had been standing, fronting me with an attitude\r\nvainglorious, bombastic. I saw now the metal hinge of its lower jaw\r\ndrop with astonishment, and somehow, throughout all that gigantic\r\njointed frame and that expressionless face it conveyed the aspect of\r\nits inner surge of horror.\r\n\r\nWe had heard the sardonic voice of a human! Of someone else here with\r\nus, whose presence was wholly unsuspected by the Robot!\r\n\r\nWe three stood and gazed. Across the room, in a corner to which my\r\nattention had never directly gone, was a large metal cupboard with\r\nlevers, dials and wires upon it. I had vaguely thought the thing some\r\npart of the cage controls. It was that; a storage place of batteries\r\nand current oscillators, I afterward learned. But there was space\r\ninside, and now like a door its front swung outward. A crouching black\r\nshape was there. It moved; hitched itself forward and came out. There\r\nwas revealed a man enveloped in a dead black cloak and a great round\r\nhood. He made a shapeless ball as he drew himself out from the\r\nconfined space where he had been crouching.\r\n\r\n\"So you have no master, Migul?\" he said. \"I was afraid you might think\r\nthat. I have been hiding--testing you out. However, you have done very\r\nwell for me.\"\r\n\r\nHis was an ironic, throaty human voice! It was deep and mellow, yet\r\nthere was a queer rasp to it. Mary and I stood transfixed. Migul\r\nseemed to sag. The metal columns of its legs were trembling.\r\n\r\nThe cupboard door closed. The dark shape untangled itself and stood\r\nerect. It was the figure of a man some five feet tall. The cloak\r\nwholly covered him; the hood framed his thick, wide face; in the dull\r\nglow of the cage interior Mary and I could see of his face only the\r\nheavy black brows, a great hooked nose and a wide slit of mouth.\r\n\r\nIt was Tugh, the cripple!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n_In the Burned Forest_\r\n\r\nTugh came limping forward. His cloak hung askew upon his thick\r\nshoulders, one of which was much higher than the other, with the\r\nmassive head set low between. As he advanced, Migul moved aside.\r\n\r\n\"Master, I have done well. There is no reason to punish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not, Migul. Well you have done, indeed. But I do not like\r\nyour ideas of mastery, and so I came just to make sure that you are\r\nstill very loyal to me. You have done well, indeed. Who is in this\r\nother cage which follows us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Master, Harl was in it. And the Princess Tina.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\"\r\n\r\n\"And a stranger. A man--\"\r\n\r\n\"From 1935? Did they stop there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Master, yes. But they stopped again, I think, in that same night of\r\n1777, where I did your bidding. Master, the man Major Atwood is--\"\r\n\r\n\"That is very good, Migul,\" Tugh said hastily. Mary and I standing\r\ngazing at him, did not know then that Mary's father had been murdered.\r\nAnd Tugh did not wish us to know it. \"Very good, Migul.\" He regarded\r\nus as though about to speak, but turned again to the Robot.\r\n\r\n\"And so Tina's cage follows us--as you hoped?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Master. But now there is only Harl in it. He approached us very\r\nclose a while in the past. He is alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"So?\" Tugh glanced at the Time-dials. \"Stop us where we planned. You\r\nremember--in one of those years when this space was the big forest\r\nglade.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe fronted Mary and me. \"You are patient, young sir. You do not\r\nspeak.\"\r\n\r\nHis glittering black eyes held me. They were red-rimmed eyes, like\r\nthose of a beast. He had a strangely repulsive face. His lips were\r\ncruel, and so thin they made his wide mouth like a gash. But there was\r\nan intellectuality stamped upon his features.\r\n\r\nHe held the black cloak closely around his thick, misshapen form. \"You\r\ndo not speak,\" he repeated.\r\n\r\nI moistened my dry lips. Tugh was smiling now, and suddenly I saw the\r\nfull inhuman quality of his face--the great high-bridged nose, and\r\nhigh cheek-bones; a face Satanic when he smiled.\r\n\r\nI managed, \"Should I speak, and demand the meaning of this? I do. And\r\nif you will return this girl from whence she came--\"\r\n\r\n\"It will oblige you greatly,\" he finished ironically. \"An amusing\r\nfellow. What is your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"George Rankin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Migul took you from 1935?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, as you doubtless know, you are most unwelcome.... You are\r\nwatching the dials, Migul?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Master.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can return me,\" I said. I was standing with my arm around Mary. I\r\ncould feel her shuddering. I was trying to be calm, but across the\r\nbackground of my consciousness thoughts were whirling. We must escape.\r\nThis Tugh was our real enemy, and for all the gruesome aspect of the\r\npseudo-human Robot, this man Tugh seemed the more sinister, more\r\nmenacing.... We must escape. Tugh would never return us to our own\r\nworlds. But the cage was stopping presently. We were loose: a sudden\r\nrush--\r\n\r\nDared I chance it? Already I had been in conflict with Migul, and\r\nlived through it. But this Tugh--was he armed? What weapons might be\r\nbeneath that cloak? Would he kill me if I crossed him?... Whirling\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTugh was saying, \"And Mary--\" I snapped from my thoughts as Mary\r\ngripped me, trembling at Tugh's words, shrinking from his gaze.\r\n\r\n\"My little Mistress Atwood, did you think because Tugh vanished that\r\nyear the war began that you were done with him? Oh, no: did I not\r\npromise differently? You, man of 1935, are unwelcome.\" His gaze roved\r\nme. \"Yet not so unwelcome, either, now that I think of it. Chain them\r\nup, Migul; use a longer chain. Give them space to move; you are\r\nunhuman.\"\r\n\r\nHe suddenly chuckled, and repeated it: \"You are unhuman, Migul!\"\r\nGhastly jest! \"Did not you know it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Master.\"\r\n\r\nThe huge mechanism advanced upon us. \"If you resist me,\" it murmured\r\nmenacingly, \"I will be obliged to kill you. I--I cannot be\r\ncontrolled.\"\r\n\r\nIt chained us now with longer chains than before. Tugh looked up from\r\nhis seat at the instrument table.\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" he said crisply. \"You may look out of the window, you\r\ntwo. You may find it interesting.\"\r\n\r\nWe were retarding with a steady drag. I could plainly see trees out of\r\nthe window--gray, spectral trees which changed their shape as I\r\nwatched them. They grew with a visible flow of movement, flinging out\r\nbranches. Occasionally one would melt suddenly down. A living, growing\r\nforest pressed close about us. And then it began opening, and moving\r\naway a few hundred feet. We were in the glade Tugh mentioned, which\r\nnow was here. There was unoccupied space where we could stop and\r\nunoccupied space five hundred feet distant.\r\n\r\nTugh and Migul were luring the other cage into stopping. Tugh wanted\r\nfive hundred feet of unoccupied space between the cages when they\r\nstopped. His diabolical purpose in that was soon to be disclosed.\r\n\r\n\"700 A. D.,\" Tugh called.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Master. I am ready.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt seemed, as our flight retarded further, that I could distinguish\r\nthe intervals when in the winter these trees were denuded. There would\r\nbe naked branches; then, in an instant, blurred and flickering forms\r\nof leaves. Sometimes there were brief periods when the gray scene was\r\ninfluenced by winter snows; other times it was tinged by the green of\r\nthe summers.\r\n\r\n\"750, Migul.... Hah! You know what to do if Harl dares to follow and\r\nstop simultaneously?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Master.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be pleasant to have him dead, eh, Migul?\"\r\n\r\n\"Master, very pleasant.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Tina, too, and that young man marooned in 1777!\" Tugh laughed.\r\nThis meant little to Mary and me; we could not suspect that Larry was\r\nthe man.\r\n\r\n\"Migul, this is 761.\"\r\n\r\nThe Robot was at the door. I murmured to Mary to brace herself for the\r\nstopping. I saw the dark naked trees and the white of a snow in the\r\nwinter of 761; the coming spring of 762. And then the alternate\r\nflashes of day and night.\r\n\r\nThe now familiar sensations of stopping rushed over us. There was a\r\nnight seconds long. Then daylight.\r\n\r\nWe stopped in the light of an April day of 762 A. D. There had been a\r\nforest fire: so brief a thing we had not noticed it is we passed. The\r\ntrees were denuded over a widespread area; the naked blackened trunks\r\nstood stripped of smaller branches and foliage. I think that the fire\r\nhad occurred the previous autumn; in the silt of ashes and charred\r\nbranches with which the ground was strewn, already a new pale-green\r\nvegetation was springing up.\r\n\r\nOur cage was set now in what had been a woodland glade, an irregularly\r\ncircular space of six or eight hundred feet, with the wreckage of the\r\nburned forest around it. We were on a slight rise of ground. Through\r\nthe denuded trees the undulating landscape was visible over a\r\nconsiderable area. It was high noon, and the sun hung in a pale blue\r\nsky dotted with pure white clouds.\r\n\r\nAhead of us, fringed with green where the fire had not reached, lay a\r\nblue river, sparkling in the sunlight. The Hudson! But it was not\r\nnamed yet; nearly eight hundred and fifty years were to pass before\r\nHendrick Hudson came sailing up this river, adventuring, hoping that\r\nhere was the way to China.\r\n\r\nWe were near the easterly side of the glade; to the west there was\r\nmore than five hundred feet of vacant space. It was there the other\r\ncage would appear, if it stopped.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs Mary and I stood by the window at the end of the chain-lengths\r\nwhich held us, Tugh and Migul made hurried preparations.\r\n\r\n\"Go quickly, near the spot where he will arrive. When he sees you, run\r\naway, Migul. You understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Master.\" The Robot left our doorway, tramping with stiff-legged\r\ntread across the glade. Tugh was in the room behind us, and I turned\r\nto him and asked:\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do?\"\r\n\r\nHe was at the telespectroscope. I saw on its recording mirror the\r\nwraith-like image of the other vehicle. It was coming! It would be\r\nretarding, maneuvering to stop at just this Time when now we existed\r\nhere; but across the glade, where Migul now was leaning against a\r\ngreat black tree-trunk, there was yet no evidence of it.\r\n\r\nTugh did not answer my question. Mary said quaveringly:\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked up. \"Do not concern yourself, my dear. I am not going to\r\nhurt you, nor this young man of 1935. Not yet.\"\r\n\r\nHe left the table and came at us. His cloak parted in front and I saw\r\nhis crooked hips, and shriveled bent legs.\r\n\r\n\"You stay at the window, both of you, and keep looking out. I want\r\nthis Harl to see you, but not me. Do you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"And if you gesture, or cry out--if you do anything to warn him,\"--he\r\nwas addressing me, with a tone grimly menacing--\"then I will kill you.\r\nBoth of you. Do you understand?\"\r\n\r\nI did indeed. Nor could I doubt him. \"We will do what you want.\" I\r\nsaid. What, to me, was the life of this unknown Harl compared to the\r\nsafety of Mary Atwood?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTugh crouched behind the table. From around its edge he could see out\r\nthe doorway and across the glade. I was aware of a weapon in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Do not look around again,\" he repeated. \"The other cage is coming;\r\nit's almost here.\"\r\n\r\nI held Mary, and we gazed out. We were pressed against the bars, and\r\nsunlight was on our heads and shoulders. I realized that we could be\r\nplainly seen from across the glade. We were lures--decoys to trap\r\nHarl.\r\n\r\nHow long an interval went by I cannot judge. The scene was very\r\nsilent, the blackened forest lying sullen in the noonday sunlight.\r\nAgainst the tree, five hundred feet or so from us, the dark towering\r\nmetal figure of the Robot stood motionless.\r\n\r\nWould the other cage come? I tried to guess in what part of this open\r\nglade it would appear.\r\n\r\nAt a movement behind me I turned slightly. At once the voice of Tugh\r\nhissed:\r\n\r\n\"Do not do that! I warn you!\"\r\n\r\nHis shrouded figure was still hunched behind the table. He was peering\r\ntoward the open door. I saw in his hand a small, barrel-like weapon,\r\nwith a wire dangling from it. The wire lay like a snake across the\r\nfloor and terminated in a small metal cylinder in the room corner.\r\n\r\n\"Turn front,\" he ordered vehemently. \"One more backward look\r\nand--Careful! Here he comes!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStrange tableau in this burned forest! We were on the space of New\r\nYork City in 762 A. D. There was no life in the scene. Birds, animals\r\nand insects shunned this fire-denuded area. And the humans of the\r\nforest--were there none of them here?\r\n\r\nAbruptly I saw a group of men at the edge of the glade. They had come\r\nsilently creeping forward, hiding behind the blackened tree-trunks.\r\nThey were all behind Migul. I saw them like dark shadows darting from\r\nthe shelter of one tree-trunk to the next, a group of perhaps twenty\r\nsavages.\r\n\r\nMigul did not see them, nor, in the heavy silence, did he seem to hear\r\nthem. They came, gazing at our shining cage like animals fascinated,\r\nwondering what manner of thing it was.\r\n\r\nThey were the ancestors of our American Indians. One fellow stopped in\r\na patch of sunlight and I saw him clearly. His half-naked body had an\r\nanimal skin draped over it, and, incongruously, around his forehead\r\nwas a band of cloth holding a feather. He carried a stone ax. I saw\r\nhis face; the flat, heavy features showed his Asiatic origin.\r\n\r\nSomeone behind this leader impulsively shot an arrow across the glade.\r\nIt went over Migul's head and fell short of our cage. Migul turned,\r\nand a rain of arrows thudded harmlessly against its metal body. I\r\nheard the Robot's contemptuous laugh. It made no answering attack, but\r\nstood motionless. And suddenly, thinking it a god whom now they must\r\nplacate, the savages fell prostrate before him.\r\n\r\nStrange tableau! I saw a ball of white mist across the glade near\r\nMigul. Something was materializing; an imponderable ghost of something\r\nwas taking form. In an instant it was the wraith of a cage; then,\r\nwhere nothing had been, stood a cage. It was solid and substantial--a\r\nmetal cage-room, gleaming white in the sunlight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe tableau broke into sound and action. The savages howled. One\r\nscrambled to his feet; then others. The Robot pretended to attack\r\nthem. An eery roar came from it as it turned toward the savages, and\r\nin a panic of agonized terror they fled. In a moment they had\r\ndisappeared among the distant trees, with Migul's huge figure tramping\r\nnoisily after them.\r\n\r\nFrom the doorway of the cage across the glade, a young man was\r\ncautiously gazing. He had seen Migul make off; he saw, doubtless, Mary\r\nand me at the window of this other cage five hundred feet away. He\r\ncame cautiously out from the doorway. He was a small, slim young man,\r\nbareheaded, with a pallid face. His black garments were edged with\r\nwhite, and he seemed unarmed. He hesitated, took a step or two\r\nforward, stopped and stood cautiously peering. In the silence I could\r\nhave shouted a warning. But I did not dare. It would have meant Mary's\r\nand my death.\r\n\r\nShe clung to me. \"George, shall we?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nHarl came slowly forward. Then suddenly from the room behind us there\r\nwas a stab of light. It leaped knee-high past us, out through our door\r\nacross the glade--a tiny pencil-point of light so brilliantly\r\nblue-white that it stabbed through the bright sunlight unfaded. It\r\nwent over Harl's head, but instantly bent down and struck upon him.\r\nThere it held the briefest of instants, then was gone.\r\n\r\nHarl stood motionless for a second; then his legs bent and he fell.\r\nThe sunlight shone full on his crumpled body. And as I stared in\r\nhorror, I saw that he was not quite motionless. Writhing? I thought\r\nso: a death agony. Then I realized it was not that.\r\n\r\n\"Mary, don't--don't look!\" I said.\r\n\r\nThere was no need to tell her. She huddled beside me, shuddering, with\r\nher face pressed against my shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe body of Harl lay in a crumpled heap. But the clothes were sagging\r\ndown. The flesh inside them was melting.... I saw the white face\r\nsuddenly leprous; putrescent.... All in this moment, within the\r\nclothes, the body swiftly, decomposed.\r\n\r\nIn the sunlight of the glade lay a sagging heap of black and white\r\ngarments enveloping the skeleton of what a moment before had been a\r\nman!\r\n\r\n_(To be continued.)_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Moon Turned Green\r\n\r\n_By Hal K. Wells_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The monster whirled to confront Dixon._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Outside his laboratory Bruce Dixon finds a world of living\r\ndead men--and above, in the sky, shines a weird green moon.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was nearly midnight when Bruce Dixon finished his labors and\r\nwearily rose from before the work-bench of his lonely mountain\r\nlaboratory, located in an abandoned mine working in Southern Arizona.\r\n\r\nHe looked like some weirdly garbed monk of the Middle Ages as he\r\nstretched his tall, lithe figure. His head was completely swathed in a\r\nhood of lead-cloth, broken only by twin eyeholes of green glass. The\r\nhood merged into a long-sleeved tunic of the same fabric, while\r\nlead-cloth gauntlets covered his hands.\r\n\r\nThe lead-cloth costume was demanded by Dixon's work with radium\r\ncompounds. The result of that work lay before him on the bench--a\r\ntiny lead capsule containing a pinhead lump of a substance which Dixon\r\nbelieved would utterly dwarf earth's most powerful explosives in its\r\ncataclysmic power.\r\n\r\nSo engrossed had Dixon been in the final stages of his work that for\r\nthe last seventy-two hours he had literally lived there in his\r\nlaboratory. It remained now only for him to step outside and test the\r\neffect of the little contact grenade, and at the same time get a badly\r\nneeded taste of fresh air.\r\n\r\nHe set the safety catch on the little bomb and slipped it into his\r\npocket. As he started for the door he threw back his hood, revealing\r\nthe ruggedly good-looking face of a young man in the early thirties,\r\nwith lines of weariness now etched deeply into the clean-cut features.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe moment that Dixon entered the short winding tunnel that led to the\r\nouter air he was vaguely aware that something was wrong. There was a\r\nstrange and intangibly sinister quality in the moonlight that streamed\r\ndimly into the winding passage. Even the cool night air itself seemed\r\ncharged with a subtle aura of brooding evil.\r\n\r\nDixon reached the entrance and stepped out into the full radiance of\r\nthe moonlight. He stopped abruptly and stared around him in utter\r\namazement.\r\n\r\nHigh in the eastern sky there rode the disc of a full moon, but it was\r\na moon weirdly different from any that Dixon had ever seen before.\r\nThis moon was a deep and baleful green; was glowing with a stark\r\nmalignant fire like that which lurks in the blazing heart of a giant\r\nemerald! Bathed in the glow of the intense green rays, the desolate\r\nmountain landscape shone with a new and eery beauty.\r\n\r\nDixon took a dazed step forward. His foot thudded softly into a small\r\nfeathered body there in the sparse grass, and he stooped to pick it\r\nup. It was a crested quail, with every muscle as stonily rigid as\r\nthough the bird had been dead for hours. Yet Dixon, to his surprise,\r\nfelt the slow faint beat of a pulse still in the tiny body.\r\n\r\nThen a dim group of unfamiliar objects down in the shadows of a small\r\ngully in front of him caught Dixon's eye. Tucking the body of the\r\nquail inside his tunic for later examination, he hurried down into the\r\ngully. A moment later he was standing by what had been the night camp\r\nof a prospector.\r\n\r\nThe prospector was still there, his rigid figure wrapped in a blanket,\r\nand his wide-open eyes staring sightlessly at the malignant green moon\r\nin the sky above. Dixon knelt to examine the stricken man's body. It\r\nshowed the same mysterious condition as that of the quail, rigidly\r\nstiff in every muscle, yet with the slow pulse and respiration of life\r\nstill faintly present.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDixon found the prospector's horse and burro sprawled on the ground\r\nhalf a dozen yards away, both animals frozen in the same baffling\r\ncondition of living death. Dixon's brain reeled as he tried to fathom\r\nthe incredible calamity that had apparently overwhelmed the world\r\nwhile he had been hidden away in his subterranean laboratory. Then a\r\nnew and terrible thought assailed him.\r\n\r\nIf the grim effect of the baleful green rays was universal in its\r\nextent, what then of old Emil Crawford and his niece, Ruth Lawton?\r\nCrawford, an inventor like Dixon, had his laboratory in a valley some\r\nfive miles away.\r\n\r\nAn abrupt chill went over Dixon's heart at the thought of Ruth\r\nLawton's vivid Titian-haired beauty being forever stilled in the grip\r\nof that eery living death. He and Ruth had loved each other ever\r\nsince they had first met.\r\n\r\nDixon broke into a run as he headed for a nearby ridge that looked out\r\nover the valley. His pulse hammered with unusual violence as he\r\nscrambled up the steep incline, and his muscles seemed to be tiring\r\nwith strange rapidity. He had a vague feeling that the rays of that\r\nmalignant green moon were beating directly into his brain, clouding\r\nhis thoughts and draining his physical strength.\r\n\r\nGaining the crest of the ridge, he stopped aghast as he looked down\r\nthe valley toward Emil Crawford's place. Near the site of Crawford's\r\nlaboratory home was an unearthly pyrotechnic display such as Dixon had\r\nnever seen before. An area several hundred yards in diameter seemed\r\none vivid welter of pulsing colors, with flashing lances of every hue\r\ncrisscrossing in and through a great central cloud of ever-changing\r\nopalescence like a fiery aurora borealis gone mad.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDixon fought back the ever-increasing lethargy that was benumbing his\r\nbrain, and groped dazedly for a key to this new riddle. Was it some\r\nweird and colossal experiment of Emil Crawford's that was causing the\r\ngreen rays of death from a transformed moon, an experiment the earthly\r\nbase of which was amid the seething play of blazing colors down there\r\nin the valley?\r\n\r\nThe theory seemed hardly a plausible one. As far as Dixon knew,\r\nCrawford's work had been confined almost entirely to a form of\r\nradio-propelled projectile for use in war-time against marauding\r\nplanes.\r\n\r\nDixon shook his head forcibly in a vain effort to clear the stupor\r\nthat was sweeping over him. It was strange how the vivid rays of that\r\nmalevolent green moon seemed to sear insidiously into one's brain,\r\nstifling thought as a swamp fog stifles the sunlight.\r\n\r\nThen Dixon suddenly froze into stark immobility, staring with startled\r\neyes at the base of a rocky crag thirty yards away. Something was\r\nlurking there in the green-black shadows--a great sprawling black\r\nshape of abysmal horror, with a single flaming opalescent eye fixed\r\nunwinkingly upon Dixon.\r\n\r\nThe next moment the vivid moon was suddenly obscured by drifting wisps\r\nof cloud. As the green light blurred to an emerald haze, the creature\r\nunder the crag came slithering out toward Dixon.\r\n\r\nHe had a vague glimpse of a monster such as one should see only in\r\nnightmares--a huge loathesome spider-form with a bloated body as long\r\nas that of a man, and great sprawling legs that sent it half a dozen\r\nyards nearer Dixon in one effortless leap.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe onslaught proved too much for Dixon's morale, half-dazed as he was\r\nby the green moon's paralyzing rays. With a low inarticulate cry of\r\nterror, he turned and ran, straining every muscle in a futile effort\r\nto distance the frightful thing that inexorably kept pace in the\r\nshadowy emerald gloom behind him.\r\n\r\nDixon's strength faded rapidly after his first wild sprint. Fifty\r\nyards more, and his faltering muscles failed him utterly. The dread\r\nrays of that grim green moon sapped his last faint powers of\r\nresistance. He staggered on for a few more painful steps then sprawled\r\nhelplessly to the ground. His brain hovered momentarily upon the verge\r\nof complete unconsciousness.\r\n\r\nThen he was suddenly aware of a fluttering struggle, inside his tunic\r\nwhere he had placed the body of the quail. A moment later and the bird\r\nwriggled free. It promptly spread its wings and flew away, apparently\r\nas vibrantly alive as before the mysterious paralysis had stricken\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe incident brought a faint surge of hope to Dixon as he dimly\r\nrealized the answer to at least part of the green moon's riddle. The\r\nbird had recovered after being shielded in the lead-cloth of his\r\ntunic. That could only mean one thing--the menace of those green moon\r\nrays must in some unknown way be radioactive. If Dixon could only get\r\nthe lead-cloth hood over his own head again he also might cheat the\r\ngreen doom.\r\n\r\nHe fumbled at the garment with fingers that seemed as stiff as wooden\r\nblocks. There was a long moment of agony when he feared that his\r\neffort had come too late. Then the hood finally slipped over his head\r\njust as utter oblivion claimed him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDixon came abruptly back to life with the dimly remembered echo of a\r\nwoman's scream still ringing in his ears. For a moment he thought that\r\nhe was awakening on his cot back in the laboratory after an unusually\r\nvivid and weird nightmare. Then the garish green moonlight around him\r\nbrought swift realization that the incredible happenings of the night\r\nwere grim reality.\r\n\r\nThe clouds were gone from the moon, leaving his surroundings again\r\nclearly outlined in the flood of green light. Dixon lifted his head\r\nand cautiously searched the scene, but he could see no trace of the\r\ngreat spider-form that had pursued him.\r\n\r\nWondering curiously why the creature had abandoned the chase at the\r\nmoment when victory was within its grasp, Dixon rose lithely to his\r\nfeet. The protecting hood had brought a quick and complete recovery\r\nfrom the devastating effects of the green moon's rays. His muscles\r\nwere again supple, and his brain once more functioned with clearness.\r\n\r\nThen abruptly Dixon's blood froze as the sound of a woman's scream\r\ncame again. The cry was that of a woman in the last extremity of\r\nterror, and Dixon knew with a terrible certainty that that woman was\r\nRuth Lawton!\r\n\r\nHe raced toward the small ridge of rocks from behind which the sound\r\nhad apparently come. A moment later he reached the scene, and stopped\r\nhorror-stricken.\r\n\r\nThree figures were there in a small rock-walled clearing. One was old\r\nEmil Crawford, sprawled unconscious on his side, the soft glow of a\r\nsmall white globe in a strange head-piece atop his gray hair shining\r\neerily in the green moonlight.\r\n\r\nNear Crawford's body loomed the giant spider-creature, and clutched\r\nfirmly in the great claspers just under the monster's terrible fanged\r\nmouth was the slender body of Ruth Lawton. Merciful unconsciousness\r\nhad apparently overwhelmed the girl now, for she lay supinely in the\r\ndread embrace, with eyes closed and lips silent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs the monster dropped the girl's body to the ground and whirled to\r\nconfront Dixon, for the first time he had a clear view of the thing in\r\nall its horror.\r\n\r\nHe shuddered in uncontrollable nausea. The incredible size of the\r\ncreature was repellent enough, but it was the grisly head of the\r\nmonstrosity that struck the final note of horror. That head was more\r\nthan half human!\r\n\r\nThe fangs and other mouth parts were those of a giant tarantula, but\r\nthese merged directly into the mutilated but unmistakable head of a\r\nman--with an aquiline nose, staring eyes, and a touseled mop of dirty\r\nbrown hair. Resting on top of the head was a metallic head-piece\r\nsimilar to the one worn by Emil Crawford, but the small globe in this\r\none blazed with a fiery opalescence.\r\n\r\nThe creature crouched lower, with its legs twitching in obvious\r\npreparation for a spring. Dixon looked wildly about him for a possible\r\nweapon, but saw nothing. Then he suddenly remembered the little lead\r\ngrenade in his pocket. The cataclysmic power of that little bomb\r\nshould be more than a match for even this monster.\r\n\r\nHis fingers closed over the grenade just as the great spider's\r\ntwitching legs straightened in a mighty effort that sent it hurtling\r\nthrough the air straight toward him.\r\n\r\nDixon dodged to one side with a swiftness that caused the monster to\r\nmiss by a good yard. Dixon raced a dozen paces farther away, then\r\nwhirled to face the great spider. The creature's legs began scuttling\r\nwarily forward. It was to be no wild leap through the air this time,\r\nbut a swift rush over the ground that Dixon would be powerless to\r\nevade.\r\n\r\nReleasing the safety catch of the grenade, Dixon hurled the tiny\r\nmissile straight at the rock floor just under the feet of that vast\r\nmisshapen creature. There was a vivid flash of blinding blue flame,\r\nthen a terrific report. Dazed by the concussion, but unhurt, Dixon\r\ncautiously went over to investigate the result of the explosion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne brief glance was enough. The hideous mass of shattered flesh\r\nsprawling there on the rocks would never again be a menace. The only\r\nthing that had escaped destruction in that shattering blast was the\r\nstrange head-piece the thing had worn. Either the small shining globe\r\nwas practically indestructible, or else it had been spared by some odd\r\nfreak of the explosive, for it still blazed in baleful opalescence\r\natop the shattered head.\r\n\r\nDixon hurried back to where Emil Crawford and Ruth Lawton lay. The\r\ngirl's body was so rigidly inert that Dixon threw back his\r\nencumbering hood and knelt over her for a swift examination. His fears\r\nwere quickly realized. Ruth was already a victim of the green moon's\r\ndread paralysis.\r\n\r\n\"Dixon! Bruce Dixon!\"\r\n\r\nDixon turned at the call. Emil Crawford, his face drawn with pain, had\r\nstruggled up on one elbow. The old man was obviously fighting off\r\ncomplete collapse by sheer will power.\r\n\r\n\"Dixon! Replace Ruth's shining head-piece at once!\" Crawford gasped.\r\n\"That will make her immune from the Green Death, and then we can--\"\r\nThe old man's voice swiftly faded away into silence as he again\r\nfainted.\r\n\r\nDixon hurriedly searched the scene and found Ruth's head-piece on the\r\nground where it had apparently fallen in her first struggle with the\r\ngiant spider, but the tiny white globe in the device was shattered and\r\ndark.\r\n\r\nDespair gripped Dixon for a moment. Then he remembered the unbroken\r\nhead-piece of the slain monster. True, the glow of its globe was\r\nopalescent instead of white, but it seemed to offer its wearer the\r\nsame immunity to the green moon's rays.\r\n\r\nHe swiftly retrieved the head-piece from the spider-creature's body,\r\nand set the light metal framework in place on Ruth's auburn curls.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nResults came with incredible quickness. The rigidity left Ruth's body\r\nimmediately. Her breath came in fast-quickening gasps, and her eyes\r\nfluttered open as Dixon knelt over her.\r\n\r\n\"It's Bruce, Ruth--Bruce Dixon,\" he said tenderly. \"Don't you know me,\r\ndear?\"\r\n\r\nBut there was no trace of recognition in those wide-open blue eyes\r\nstaring fixedly up at him. For a moment Ruth lay there with muscles\r\nstrangely tense. Then with a lithe strength that was amazing she\r\nsuddenly twisted free of the clasp of Dixon's arms and sprang to her\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe next minute Dixon gave ground, and he found himself battling for\r\nhis very life. This was not the Ruth Lawton whom he had known and\r\nloved. This was a madwoman of savage menace, with soft lips writhing\r\nover white teeth in a jungle snarl, and blue eyes that fairly\r\nglittered with unrestrained, insensate hate.\r\n\r\nHe tried to close with the maddened girl, but instantly regretted his\r\nrashness. Her slender body seemed imbued with the strength of a\r\ntigress as she sent slim fingers clawing at his throat. He tore\r\nhimself free just in time. Dazed and shaken, he again gave ground\r\nbefore the fury of the girl's attack.\r\n\r\nHe could not bring himself to the point of actively fighting back, yet\r\nhe knew that in another moment he would either have to mercilessly\r\nbatter his beautiful adversary into helplessness or else be himself\r\novercome. There was no middle course.\r\n\r\nThen old Emil Crawford's voice came again as the old man rallied to\r\nconsciousness for another brief moment.\r\n\r\n\"Bruce, the opal globe is a direct link to those devils themselves!\r\nBreak it, Bruce, break it--for Ruth's sake as well as your own!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCrawford had barely finished his gasped warning when Ruth again hurled\r\nherself forward upon Dixon with tapering fingers curved like talons as\r\nthey sought his throat. Dixon swept her clutching hands aside with a\r\ndesperate left-handed parry, then snatched wildly at the gleaming\r\nhead-piece with his right hand.\r\n\r\nThe thing came away in his grasp, and in the same swift movement he\r\nsavagely smashed it against the rocky wall beside him. Whatever the\r\nopalescent globe's eery powers might be, it was not indestructible. It\r\nshattered like a bursting bubble, its fire dying in a tiny cloud of\r\nparticles that shimmered faintly for a moment, then was gone.\r\n\r\nAgain, the effect upon Ruth was almost instantaneous. Every trace of\r\nher insane fury vanished. She swayed dizzily and would have fallen had\r\nnot Dixon caught her in his arms. For a moment she looked up into his\r\nface with eyes in which recognition now shone unmistakably. Then her\r\neyelids slowly closed, and she again lapsed into unconsciousness.\r\n\r\nDixon looked over at Emil Crawford, and found that the old man had\r\nagain collapsed. Dixon knew of but one thing to do with the stricken\r\nman and girl, and that was to take them to his laboratory. The\r\nlaboratory, apparently insulated by veins of lead ore in the mountain\r\nsurrounding it, was the one sure spot of refuge in this weird\r\nnightmare world of paralyzing lunar rays and prowling monsters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFlinging his tunic over Ruth's head to shield her as much as possible\r\nfrom the moonlight, he carried her to the laboratory, then returned\r\nfor Emil Crawford. Safe within the subterranean retreat with the old\r\nscientist, Dixon removed his encumbering lead costume and began doing\r\nwhat he could for the stricken pair.\r\n\r\nRuth was still unconscious, but the cataleptic rigidity was already\r\nnearly gone from her body, and her breathing was now the deep\r\nrespiration of normal sleep.\r\n\r\nEmil Crawford's condition was more serious. Not only was the old man's\r\nfrail strength nearly exhausted, but he was also badly wounded. His\r\nthin chest was seared by two great livid areas of burned flesh, the\r\nnature of which puzzled Dixon as he began to dress the injuries. They\r\nseemed of radioactive origin, yet in many ways they were unlike any\r\nradium burns that Dixon had ever seen.\r\n\r\nWhile Dixon was working over him, Crawford stirred weakly and opened\r\nhis eyes. He sighed in relief as he recognized his surroundings.\r\n\r\n\"Good boy, Bruce!\" he commended wanly. \"We are safe here among the\r\ninsulating veins of lead ore in the mountain. This is where Ruth and I\r\nwere trying to come after we escaped from those devils to-night. But,\r\nBruce, how did you guess the radioactive nature of the Green Sickness\r\nin time to avoid falling a victim to it as soon as you left the\r\nshelter of your laboratory?\"\r\n\r\n\"My escape was entirely luck,\" Dixon admitted grimly. \"To-night I left\r\nmy laboratory for the first time in three days. I found a world gone\r\nmad, with a strange green moon blazing down upon a land of living dead\r\nmen, and with marauding monsters hideous enough to have been spawned\r\nin the Pit itself. What in Heaven's name does it all mean?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid that it means the end of the world, Bruce,\" Crawford\r\nanswered quietly. \"It was a little over forty-eight hours ago that the\r\nincredible event first happened. Without a moment's warning, _the moon\r\nturned green_! Hardly had the world's astronomers had time to\r\nspeculate upon this amazing phenomenon before the Green Sickness\r\nstruck--a pestilence of appalling deadliness that swept resistlessly\r\nin the path of those weird green rays. Wherever the green moon shone,\r\nevery living creature succumbed with ghastly swiftness to the\r\ncondition of living death that you have seen.\r\n\r\n\"Westward with the racing moon sped the Green Sickness, and nothing\r\nstayed its attack. The green rays pierced through buildings of wood,\r\nstone, and iron as though they did not exist. A doomed world had\r\nneither time nor opportunity to guess that lead was the one armor\r\nagainst those dread rays. To-night, Bruce, we are in all probability\r\nthe only three human beings on this planet who are not slumbering in\r\nthe paralytic stupor of the Green Sickness.\r\n\r\n\"Ruth and I were stricken with the rest of the world,\" Crawford\r\ncontinued. \"We recovered consciousness hours later to find ourselves\r\ncaptives in the Earth-camp of the invaders themselves. You probably\r\nsaw the display of lights that marks their camp down in the valley a\r\nmile beyond my place. We have learned since that the space ship of the\r\ninvaders dropped silently down into the valley the night before the\r\nmoon turned green and established the camp as a sort of outpost and\r\nobservatory. They left two of their number there as pioneers, then the\r\nrest of them departed in the space ship for their present post up near\r\nthe moon.\r\n\r\n\"Ruth and I were revived only that the two invaders in the camp might\r\nquestion us regarding life on this planet. They have a science that is\r\nbased upon principles as utterly strange and incomprehensible to us as\r\nours probably is to them. They probed my brain with a thought machine.\r\nIt was an apparatus that worked both ways. What knowledge they got\r\nfrom me I do not know, but I do know that they unwittingly told me\r\nmuch in the bizarre and incredible mental pictures that the machine\r\ncarried from their brains to mine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"They are refugees. Bruce, from a planet that circled about the star\r\nthat we know as Alpha Centauri, a star that is the nearest of all our\r\nstellar neighbors, being only four and a third light years distant.\r\nTheir home planet was disrupted by a colossal engineering experiment\r\nof the Centaurians themselves, the only survivors being a group of\r\nfifty who escaped in a space ship just before the catastrophe.\r\n\r\n\"There were no other habitable planets in their own system, so in\r\ndesperation these refugees sped out across the void to our solar\r\nsystem in the hope of finding a new home here. They reconnoitered our\r\nEarth secretly and found it ideal. But first they believed that they\r\nmust conquer the life that already held this Earth. To do this, they\r\nstruck with the Green Sickness.\r\n\r\n\"The rays that are turning the moon green emanate from the space ship\r\nhovering up there some fifty thousand miles from the moon itself. The\r\nCentaurian's rays, blending with the sunlight striking the disc of the\r\nfull moon, are intensified in some unknown way, then reflected across\r\nthe quarter of a million miles to the Earth, to flood this planet with\r\nvirulent radiance.\r\n\r\n\"The green moonlight is radioactive in nature, and overcomes animal\r\nlife within a matter of fifteen minutes or less. The rays are most\r\npowerful when the moon is in the sky, but their effect continues even\r\nafter it has set, because as long as the green moonlight strikes any\r\npart of the Earth's atmosphere the entire atmospheric envelope of the\r\nplanet remains charged with the paralyzing radioactive influence.\r\n\r\n\"Earth's inhabitants are not dead. They are merely stupefied. If the\r\ngreen rays were to cease now, most of the victims of the Green\r\nSickness would quickly recover with little permanent injury. But,\r\nBruce, if that evil green moon blazes on for twenty-four hours more,\r\nthe brain powers of Earth's millions will be forever shattered. So\r\nweakened will they be by then that recovery will be impossible even\r\nwith the rays shut off, and the entire planet will be populated only\r\nby mindless imbeciles, readily available material for the myriads of\r\nmonstrous hybrids that the invaders will create to serve them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"To-night you saw the hybrid that the invaders sent to recapture Ruth and\r\nme. It was a fit specimen of the grisly magic which those devils from\r\nouter space work with their uncanny surgery and growth-stimulating\r\nradioactive rays. The basic element of that monster was an ordinary\r\ntarantula spider, with its growth incredibly increased in a few short\r\nhours of intensive ray treatment in the Centaurian's camp. The half-head\r\ngrafted to it was that of a human being. They always graft the brain\r\ncavity of a mammal to a hybrid--half heads of burros, horses, or even\r\ndogs, but preferably those of human beings. I think that they prefer to\r\nuse as great a brain power as possible.\r\n\r\n\"The hybrids are controlled through the small opalescent globes on\r\ntheir heads, globes that are in direct tune with a huge master globe\r\nof opalescent fire in the invaders' camp. When Ruth attacked you after\r\nyou placed the opal head-piece upon her head, she was for the moment\r\nmerely another of the invaders' servants blindly obeying the broadcast\r\ncommand to kill. The white globes that Ruth and I wore when we escaped\r\nfrom the camp were identical with those worn by the invaders\r\nthemselves, being nothing more than harmless insulators against the\r\neffect of the green moonlight.\"\r\n\r\nA sudden spasm of pain convulsed Crawford's face. Dixon sprang forward\r\nto aid him, but the old man rallied with an effort and weakly waved\r\nDixon back.\r\n\r\n\"I'm all right, Bruce,\" he gasped. \"My strength is nearly exhausted,\r\nthat is all. Like a garrulous old fool I've worn myself out talking\r\nabout everything but the one important subject. Bruce, have you\r\ndeveloped that new and infinitely powerful explosive you were working\r\non?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Dixon answered grimly. \"I have an explosive right here in the\r\nlaboratory that can easily blow the Centaurian's camp completely off\r\nthe map.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCrawford shook his head impatiently. \"Destroying the camp would do no\r\ngood. We must shatter the space ship itself if we are to extinguish\r\nthose green rays in time to save our world.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is impossible if the space ship is hovering up there by the\r\nmoon!\" Dixon protested.\r\n\r\n\"No, it is not impossible,\" Crawford answered confidently. \"I have a\r\nprojectile in my laboratory that will not only hurtle across that\r\ngreat gap with incredible speed, but will also infallibly strike its\r\ntarget when it gets there. It is a projectile that is as irresistibly\r\ndrawn by radio waves as steel is by a magnet, and it will speed as\r\nstraight to the source of those waves as a bit of steel will to the\r\nmagnet.\r\n\r\n\"The Centaurians in the space ship,\" Crawford continued, \"are in\r\nconstant communication with their camp through radio apparatus much\r\nlike our own. If you can pack a powerful contact charge of your\r\nexplosive in my projectile, I can guarantee that when the projectile\r\nis released it will flash out into space and score a direct hit\r\nagainst the walls of the space ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can pack the explosive in the projectile, all right,\" Dixon\r\nanswered grimly. \"We will need only a lump the size of an egg, and a\r\nsmall container of the heavy gas that activates it. The explosive\r\nitself is a radium compound that, when allowed to come in contact with\r\nthe activating gas, becomes so unstable that any sharp blow will set\r\nit off in an explosion that in a matter of seconds releases the\r\ninfinite quantities of energy usually released by radium over a period\r\nof at least twelve hundred years. The cataclysmic force of that\r\nexplosion should be enough to wreck a small planet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" Crawford commended weakly. \"If you can only strike your blow\r\nto-night, Bruce, our world still has a chance. If only you--\" The old\r\nman's voice suddenly failed. He sank back in utter collapse, his eyes\r\nclosed and his last vestige of strength spent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKnowing that the old man would probably remain in his sleep of\r\ncomplete exhaustion for hours, Dixon turned his attention to Ruth. To\r\nhis surprise, he found her sitting up, apparently completely\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\n\"I'm quite all right again,\" she said reassuringly. \"I've been\r\nlistening to what Uncle told you. Go ahead and prepare your explosive,\r\nBruce. I'll do what I can for Uncle while you're working.\"\r\n\r\nDixon donned his lead-cloth hood and tunic again and set to work. Ten\r\nminutes later he turned to Ruth with a slender foot-long cylinder of\r\nlead in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Ruth, will this fit your Uncle's projectile?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Easily,\" she assured him. \"But isn't it frightfully dangerous to\r\ncarry in that form?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it's absolutely safe now, and will be safe until this stud is\r\nturned, releasing the activating gas from one compartment to mingle\r\nwith the radium compound in the other section. Then the cylinder will\r\nbecome a bomb that any sharp jar will detonate.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, let's go then,\" Ruth answered. \"Have you any more of those\r\nlead clothes that I can wear? I could wear the globe head-piece that\r\nUncle wore, but it would loom up in the dark like a searchlight.\"\r\n\r\nDixon did not protest Ruth's going with him. There was nothing further\r\nthat could be done for Emil Crawford for hours and in the hazardous\r\nsally to Crawford's laboratory he knew that Ruth's cool courage and\r\nquick wits would at least double their chances for success in their\r\ndesperate mission. He provided her with a reserve hood and tunic of\r\nlead cloth, then handed her a tiny leaden pellet.\r\n\r\n\"Keep this for a last resort,\" he told her. \"It's a contact bomb that\r\nbecomes ready to throw when this safety catch is snapped over. I wish\r\nwe had a dozen of them, but that's the last capsule I had and there's\r\nno time to prepare more.\"\r\n\r\nHe fished a rusty old revolver out of a drawer, and placed it in his\r\npocket. \"I'll use this gun for a last resort weapon myself,\" he said.\r\n\"The action only works about half the time, but it's the only firearm\r\nin the place.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe green moon was still high in the sky as Ruth and Dixon emerged\r\nfrom the tunnel, but it was already beginning to drop gradually down\r\ntoward the west. Dixon wheeled his disreputable flivver out of its\r\nnearby shed. With engine silent they started coasting down the rough\r\nwinding road into the valley.\r\n\r\nFor nearly two miles they wound down the long grade. Then, just as\r\nthey reached the valley floor they saw, far up among the rocks to the\r\nleft of the road, the thing they had been dreading--the bobbing\r\nopalescent globe that marked the presence of one of the Centaurians'\r\nhideous hybrids. The shimmering globe paused for a moment, then came\r\nracing down toward them.\r\n\r\nThe need for secrecy was past. Dixon threw the car in gear and\r\nsavagely pulled down the gas lever. With throttle wide open they\r\nhurtled around the perilous curves of the narrow road, but always in\r\nthe rocks beside and above them they heard the scuttling progress of\r\nsome huge, many-legged creature that constantly kept pace with them.\r\n\r\nThey had occasional glimpses of the thing. Its pale jointed body was\r\nsome twenty feet in length, and had apparently been developed from\r\nthat of a centipede, with scores of racing legs that carried it with\r\nstartling speed over the rocky terrain.\r\n\r\nThe flivver raced madly on toward the blaze of kaleidoscopic colors\r\nthat marked the Centaurians' camp. Crawford's home loomed up now\r\nbarely a hundred yards ahead.\r\n\r\nAs though sensing that its quarry was about to escape, the hybrid\r\nflashed a burst of speed that sent it on by the car for a full fifty\r\nyards, then down into the road directly in front, where it whirled to\r\nconfront them. Dixon knew that he could never stop the car in the\r\nshort gap separating them from that huge upreared figure, and to\r\nattempt swerving from the road upon either side was certain disaster.\r\n\r\nHe took the only remaining chance. With throttle wide open he sent the\r\nlittle car hurtling straight for the giant centipede. He threw his\r\nbody in front of Ruth, to shield her as much as possible, just as they\r\nsmashed squarely into the hybrid.\r\n\r\nThe impact was too much for even that monstrous figure. It was hurled\r\nbodily from the road to crash upon the jagged rocks at the bottom of a\r\nthirty-foot gully. There it sprawled in a broken mass, too hopelessly\r\nshattered to ever rise again.\r\n\r\nThe flivver skidded momentarily, then crumpled to a full stop against\r\nthe rocks at the side of the road. Dixon and Ruth scrambled from the\r\nwreckage and raced for Crawford's home, scarcely fifty yards ahead.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey entered the laboratory and Ruth went directly over to where the\r\nradio-projectile rested in a wall-rack. Dixon took the gleaming\r\ncylinder down to examine it. Tapering to a rounded point at the front\r\nend, it was nearly a yard long and about five inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n\"The mechanism inside the projectile is turned off now, of course,\"\r\nRuth said. \"If it were turned on, the projectile would have been on\r\nits way to the space ship long ago, for the radio waves are as strong\r\nhere as at the Centaurians' camp.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl pointed to a small metal stud in the nose of the projectile.\r\n\r\n\"When that is snapped over, it makes the contact that sets the\r\nmagnetizing mechanism into action,\" she explained. \"Then the\r\nprojectile will go hurtling directly for the source of any radio waves\r\nwithin range. I don't know the nature of its mechanism. Uncle merely\r\ntold me that it is the application of an entirely new principle of\r\nelectricity.\"\r\n\r\nDixon laid the long projectile down on the work-bench, and began\r\npacking his lead cylinder of explosive inside it. He had to release\r\nthe lead cylinder's safety catch before closing the projectile, which\r\nmade his work a thrillingly precarious one, for any sharp blow now\r\nwould detonate the unstable mixture of gas and radium compound in one\r\ncataclysmic explosion.\r\n\r\nHe sighed in relief as he finally straightened up with the completed\r\nprojectile held carefully in both hands.\r\n\r\n\"All we have to do now, Ruth,\" he said, \"is step out from under this\r\nroof and snap that energizing stud. Then this little package of\r\ndestruction will be on its way to our Centaurian friends up there by\r\nthat pestilential green moon.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRuth stepped ahead to open the door for him. With the end of their\r\ntask so near at hand, both forgot to be cautious.\r\n\r\nRuth threw the door open and took one step outside, then suddenly\r\nscreamed in terror as her shoulders were encircled by a long\r\nsnake-like object that came whipping down from some vast something\r\nthat had been lurking just outside. Dixon tried to dodge back, but too\r\nlate. Another great hairy tentacle came lashing around his shoulders,\r\npinning his arms tightly and jerking him out of the doorway.\r\n\r\nHe had a swift vague glimpse of a hybrid looming there in the green\r\nmoonlight--a tarantula hybrid that in size and horror dwarfed any of\r\nthe frightful products of Centaurian science that he had yet seen.\r\n\r\nBefore Dixon had time to note any of the details of his assailant\r\nanother tentacle curled around him, tearing the projectile from his\r\ngrasp. Then he was irresistibly drawn up toward that grisly head where\r\nRuth's body was also suspended in one of the powerful tentacles. The\r\nnext moment, bearing its burdens with amazing ease, the giant hybrid\r\nstarted off.\r\n\r\nDixon tried with all his strength to squirm free enough to get a hand\r\nupon the revolver in his pocket, but the constricting tentacle did not\r\ngive for even an inch. The only result of his effort was to twist his\r\nhood to one side, leaving him as effectually blindfolded as though his\r\nhead were in a sack.\r\n\r\nLong minutes of swaying, pitching motion followed as the hybrid sped\r\nover the rocky ridges and gullies. It finally came to a halt, and for\r\nanother minute or so Dixon was held there motionless in mid-air, dimly\r\nconscious of a subdued hum of activity all about him. Then he was\r\ngently lowered to the ground again.\r\n\r\nWhile one tentacle still held him securely, another tore away his hood\r\nand tunic. Almost immediately the hood was replaced by one of the\r\nprotective white globe devices. Dixon blinked for a moment in\r\nhalf-blinded bewilderment as he got his first glimpse of the\r\nEarth-camp of the Centaurians.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe place, located on the smooth rock floor of a large natural basin,\r\nseemed a veritable cauldron of seething colors which rippled and\r\nblended in a dazzling maze of unearthly splendor. But Dixon forgot\r\neverything else in that weird camp as his startled gaze fell upon the\r\ncreature standing directly in front of him.\r\n\r\nHe knew instinctively that the thing must be one of the Alpha\r\nCentaurians, for in its alien grotesqueness the figure was utterly\r\ndissimilar to anything ever seen upon Earth before.\r\n\r\nLife upon the shattered planet of that far distant sun had apparently\r\nsprung from sources both crustacean and reptilian. The Centaurian\r\nstood barely five feet in height. Its bulky, box-like body was\r\ncompletely covered with a chitinous armor that gleamed pale yellowish\r\ngreen.\r\n\r\nTwo short powerful legs, scaled like those of a lizard, ended in feet\r\nthat resembled degenerated talons. Two pairs of slender arms emanated\r\nfrom the creature's shoulders, with their many-jointed flexible length\r\nending in delicate three-pronged hands.\r\n\r\nThe scaly hairless head beneath the Centaurian's white globe device\r\nbore a face that was blankly hideous. Two great lidless eyes, devoid\r\nof both pupils and whites, stared unblinkingly at Dixon like twin\r\nblobs of red-black jelly. A toothless loose-lipped mouth slavered\r\nbeneath.\r\n\r\nDixon averted his gaze from the horror of that fearful alien face, and\r\nlooked anxiously around for Ruth. He saw her almost at once, over at\r\nhis right. She was tethered by a light metallic rope that ran from her\r\nwaist to one of the metal beams supporting the great shimmering ball\r\nof opalescent fire which formed the central control of the hybrids.\r\n\r\nOne of the white globe devices had been placed upon Ruth's head and\r\nshe was apparently unhurt, for she pluckily flashed a reassuring smile\r\nat Dixon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDirectly in front of Dixon and some forty yards away there was a large\r\npen-like enclosure, with vari-colored shafts of radiance from banks of\r\nprojectors constantly sweeping through it. Dixon drew in his breath\r\nsharply as he saw the frightful life lying dormant in that pen. It was\r\na solid mass of hybrids--great loathesome figures fashioned from a\r\nscore of different worms, insects, and spiders. The globes upon the\r\ngruesome mammalian half-heads were still dark and unfired with\r\nopalescence.\r\n\r\nThe invaders had apparently raided most of the surrounding country in\r\nobtaining those grafted half-heads. Near where Dixon stood there was a\r\ntragic little pile of articles taken from the Centaurians'\r\nvictims--prospectors' picks, shovels, axes, and other tools.\r\n\r\nOver to the left of the dormant hybrids stood the second Alpha\r\nCentaurian, curiously examining Dixon's projectile. The creature\r\napparently suspected the deadly nature of the gleaming cylinder for it\r\nsoon laid it carefully down and packed cushions of soft fabric around\r\nit to shield it from any possible shock.\r\n\r\nThen at an unspoken command from the first Centaurian the great hybrid\r\nwhirled Dixon around to face a small enclosure just behind him in\r\nwhich were located banks of control panels and other apparatus. One of\r\nthe pieces of mechanism, with a regularly spaced stream of sparks\r\nsnapping between two terminals, was apparently a radio receiver\r\nautomatically recording the broadcast from the space ship. Dixon was\r\nunable to even guess the nature of the remaining apparatus.\r\n\r\n\"Bruce, be careful!\" Ruth called in despairing warning. \"He is going\r\nto put the thought-reading machine on your brain. Then he'll learn\r\nwhat the projectile is for, and everything will be lost!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDixon's mind raced with lightning speed in the face of this new\r\ndanger. He stealthily slipped a hand over the revolver in his pocket.\r\nThere was one vulnerable spot in the great hybrid holding him, and\r\nthat was the opalescent globe on the creature's head. If he could only\r\nsmash that globe with one well-directed shot, he might be able to\r\nelude the Centaurians for the precious minute necessary to send the\r\nprojectile on its deadly journey.\r\n\r\nThe hybrid began maneuvering Dixon toward the instrument enclosure.\r\nFor a fleeting second the grip of the tentacles upon his shoulders\r\nloosened slightly. Dixon took instant advantage of it. Twisting\r\nhimself free from the loosened tentacle in one mighty effort, he\r\nwhirled and fired pointblank at the opalescent globe on the head\r\nlooming above him.\r\n\r\nThe bullet smashed accurately home, shattering the globe like a\r\nbursting bubble. The great hybrid collapsed with startling suddenness,\r\nits life force instantly extinguished as the globe burst.\r\n\r\nDixon leaped to one side and swung the gun into line with the\r\nCentaurian's hideous face. He pulled the trigger--but there was no\r\nresponse. The rusty old firearm had hopelessly jammed.\r\n\r\nDixon savagely flung the revolver at the Centaurian. The creature\r\ntried to dodge, but the heavy gun struck its body a glancing blow.\r\nThere was a slight spurt of body fluid as the chitinous armor was\r\npartly broken.\r\n\r\nDixon's heart leaped exultantly. No wonder these creatures had to\r\ncreate hybrids to fight for them. Their own bodies were as vulnerable\r\nas that of a soft-shelled crab!\r\n\r\nThe Centaurian quickly drew a slender tube of dark green from a\r\nscabbard in its belt. Dixon dodged back, looking wildly about him for\r\na weapon. There was an ax in the pile only a few yards away. Dixon\r\nsnatched the ax up, and whirled to give battle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe other Centaurian had come hurrying over now to aid its mate. Dixon\r\nwas effectually barred from attempting any progress toward the\r\nprojectile by the two grotesque creatures as they stood alertly there\r\nbeside each other with their green tubes menacing him. Dixon waited\r\ntensely at bay, remembering those searing radium burns upon Emil\r\nCrawford's body.\r\n\r\nThen the first Centaurian abruptly leveled a second and smaller tube\r\nupon Dixon. A burst of yellow light flashed toward him, enveloping him\r\nin a cloud of pale radiance before he could dodge.\r\n\r\nThere was a faint plop as the protecting white globe upon his head was\r\nshattered. The yellow radiance swiftly faded, leaving Dixon unhurt,\r\nbut he realized that the first round in the battle had been won\r\ndecisively by the Centaurians. His only chance now, was to end the\r\nbattle before the paralyzing rays of the green moon sapped his\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nHe warily advanced upon the Centaurians. Their green tubes swung into\r\nline and twin bolts of violet flame flashed toward him. He dodged, and\r\nthe bolts missed by inches. Then Dixon nearly fell as his foot struck\r\na bundle of cloth on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe next moment he snatched the bundle up with a cry of triumph. It\r\nwas his lead-cloth tunic, torn and useless as a garment, but\r\ninvaluable as a shield against the searing effects of those bolts of\r\nradioactive flame. He hurriedly wrapped the fabric in a rough bundle\r\naround his left forearm. The next time the tubes' violet flames\r\nflashed toward him he thrust his rude shield squarely into their path.\r\nThere was a light tingling shock, and that was all. The bolts did not\r\nsear through.\r\n\r\nWith new confidence, Dixon boldly charged the two Centaurians. A weird\r\nbattle ensued in the garishly lighted arena.\r\n\r\nThe effective range of the violet flashes was only about ten feet, and\r\nDixon's muscular agility was far superior to that of his antagonists.\r\nBy constant whirling and dodging he was able to either catch the\r\nviolet bolts upon his shielded arm or else dodge them entirely.\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of the Centaurians' clumsy slowness, they maneuvered\r\nwith a cool strategy that constantly kept the Earth man's superior\r\nstrength at bay. Always as Dixon tried to close with one of them he\r\nwas forced to retreat when a flanking attack from the other threatened\r\nhis unprotected back. And always the Centaurians maneuvered to bar\r\nDixon from attempting any dash toward the projectile.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe minutes passed, and Dixon felt his strength rapidly ebbing, both\r\nfrom his herculean exertions and from the paralyzing rays of the green\r\nmoon beating down upon his unprotected head. As his speed of foot\r\nlessened the Centaurians began inexorably pressing their advantage.\r\n\r\nDixon was no longer escaping unscathed. In spite of his frantic\r\nefforts to dodge, twice the violet bolts grazed his body in searing\r\nflashes of exquisite agony.\r\n\r\nHis muscles stiffened still more in the attack of the Green Sickness.\r\nDesperately dodging a Centaurian bolt, he stumbled and nearly fell. As\r\nhe staggered to regain his balance, one of his antagonists scrambled\r\nto the coveted position behind him.\r\n\r\nIt was only Ruth's scream of warning that galvanized Dixon's numbed\r\nbrain into action in time to meet the imminent peril.\r\n\r\nIn one mighty effort he flung his ax at the Centaurian in front of\r\nhim. The heavy blade cut deep into the thinly armored body. Mortally\r\nwounded, the creature collapsed.\r\n\r\nDixon whirled and flung up his shielded left arm just in time to\r\nintercept the violet bolt of the other Centaurian. Warily backing\r\naway, Dixon succeeded in retrieving his ax from beside the twitching\r\nbody of the fallen invader.\r\n\r\nThen, with the heavy weapon again in his hand, he remorselessly\r\ncharged his remaining foe. The Centaurian's tube flashed in a\r\nveritable hail of hurtling violet bolts, but Dixon caught the flashes\r\nupon his shield and closed grimly in.\r\n\r\nOne final leap brought him to close quarters. The heavy ax whistled\r\nthrough the air in a single mighty stroke that cleft the Centaurian's\r\nfrail body nearly in two.\r\n\r\nThen Ruth's excited scream came again. \"Bruce--the other one! Get it\r\nquick!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDixon turned. The wounded invader, taking advantage of their\r\npreoccupation in the final struggle with its mate, had dragged its\r\ncrippled body over to the instrument enclosure. Dixon staggered toward\r\nit as fast as his half-paralyzed muscles would permit.\r\n\r\nHe was just too late. The Centaurian jerked a lever home a fraction of\r\na second before Dixon's smashing ax forever ended his activities. The\r\nlever's action upon the pen of inert hybrids was immediate.\r\n\r\nThe sweeping lances of light vanished in a brief sheet of vivid flame\r\nwhich kindled the dark globes on the hybrids' gruesome heads to steady\r\nopalescence--and the dread horde came to life! Sprawling from the pen,\r\nthey came scuttling toward Dixon in a surging flood--a scene out of a\r\nnightmare.\r\n\r\nDixon faced the oncoming horde in numb despair, knowing that his\r\nnearly-paralyzed body had no chance in flight. Then, just as the\r\nhybrids were nearly upon him, he heard Ruth's encouraging voice again.\r\n\r\n\"There's still one chance left, Bruce,\" she cried, \"and I'll take it!\"\r\n\r\nDixon turned. Ruth had in her hand the tiny contact grenade he had\r\ngiven her for a last emergency. She snapped the safety catch on the\r\nlittle bomb, then hurled it squarely at the giant opalescent globe\r\nlooming close beside her.\r\n\r\nThere was a terrific explosion and the great globe shattered to atoms.\r\nApparently stunned by the concussion but otherwise unhurt, Ruth was\r\nflung clear of the wreckage.\r\n\r\nWith the shattering of the central globe the strange life force of the\r\nhybrid horde vanished instantly and completely. Midway in their rush\r\nthey sprawled inert and dead, with their outstretched legs so close to\r\nDixon that he had to step over one or two to get clear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDixon's brain reeled in the reaction of relief from the horde's\r\nhideous menace. Then he grimly fought to clear his fast-numbing senses\r\nlong enough for the one final task that he knew must still be done.\r\n\r\nThe projectile, cushioned as it was, had escaped detonation in the\r\nblast. He had only to stagger across the twenty yards separating him\r\nfrom it, then release the stud that would send it flashing out into\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nBut his last shred of reserve strength had nearly been sapped now by\r\nthe insidious rays of that malevolent green moon. Even as he started\r\ntoward the projectile, he staggered and fell. Unable to drag himself\r\nto his feet again, he began grimly crawling with arms and legs as\r\nstiff and dead as that much stone.\r\n\r\nOnly ten more yards to go now. And now only five. Grimly, doggedly,\r\nwith senses reeling and muscles nearly dead, the last survivor of a\r\ndying planet fought desperately on under the malignant rays of the\r\nvivid green moon!\r\n\r\nOne last sprawling convulsive effort--and Dixon had the projectile in\r\nhis hands. His stiff fingers fumbled agonizingly with the activating\r\nstud. Then abruptly the stud snapped home. With a crescendo whistle of\r\nsundered air the projectile flashed upward into the western sky.\r\n\r\nDixon collapsed upon his back, his dimming eyes fixed upon the grim\r\ngreen moon. Minutes that seemed eternities dragged slowly by. Then his\r\nheart leaped in sudden hope. Had there really glowed a small blue\r\nspark up there beside the green moon--a spark marking the mighty\r\nexplosion of the radium bomb against the Centaurians' space ship?\r\n\r\nA fraction of a second later, and doubt became glorious certainty. The\r\nvivid green of the moonlight vanished. The silvery white sheen of a\r\nnormal moon again shone serenely up there in the western sky!\r\n\r\nWith the extinguishing of the dread green rays, new strength surged\r\nswiftly through Dixon's tired body. He arose and hurried over to where\r\nRuth lay limp and still near the wreckage of the great globe. He\r\nworked over her for many anxious minutes before the normal flush of\r\nhealth returned to her white cheeks and her eyes slowly opened.\r\n\r\nThen he took Ruth into his arms and for a long minute the two silently\r\ndrank in the beauty of that radiant silver moon above them, while\r\ntheir hearts thrilled with a realization of the glorious miracle of\r\nawakening life that they knew must already be beginning to rejuvenate\r\na stricken world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Death-Cloud\r\n\r\n_By Nat Schachner and Arthur L. Zagat_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Someone at a huge switchboard turned toward me. I\r\npressed the trigger._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The epic exploit of one who worked in the dark and alone,\r\nbehind the enemy lines, in the great Last War.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe sat, Eric Bolton and I, at a parapet table atop the 200-story\r\nGeneral Aviation Building. The efficient robot waiter of the Sky Club\r\nhad cleared away the remnants of an epicurean meal. Only a bowl of\r\ngolden fruit remained--globes of nectar picked in the citrus groves of\r\nCalifornia that morning.\r\n\r\nMy eye wandered over the scene spread before us, the vast piling of\r\nmasonry that is New York. The dying beams of the setting sun glinted\r\ngolden from the roofs of the pleasure palaces topping the soaring\r\nstructures. Lower, amid interlacing archings of the mid-air\r\nthoroughfares, darkness had already piled its blackness. Two thousand\r\nfeet below, in the region of perpetual night, the green-blue factory\r\nlights flared.\r\n\r\nOn three sides, the unbroken serration of the Empire City's beehives\r\nstretched in a semicircle of twenty miles radius. Long since, the\r\nrivers that had made old Manhattan an island had been roofed over.\r\nBut, to the east, the heaving sea still stretched its green expanse.\r\nOn the horizon a vast cloud mountain billowed upward from the watery\r\nsurface, white, and pink and many shades of violet.\r\n\r\n\"That's just the way it looked,\" Bolton muttered, as he drew my\r\nattention to the cloud mass. \"See that air-liner just diving into it?\r\nJust so I saw the _New York_--five thousand men--pride of the Air\r\nService--dive into that mountain of smoke. And she never came out!\r\nGone--like that!\" And he snapped his fingers.\r\n\r\nHe fell silent again, gazing dreamily at the drifting rings of pipe\r\nsmoke. He smiled, the twisted smile which was the sole indication that\r\none side of his face was the master work of a great surgeon-sculptor.\r\nA marvelous piece of work, that, but no less marvelous than the\r\nprotean changes that Bolton himself could make in his appearance. It\r\nwas this genius at impersonation that had won Bolton his commission in\r\nthe Intelligence Service, when, in 1992, the world burst into flame.\r\n\r\n\"Would you like to hear about it?\" The obtuseness of the man!\r\n\r\n\"If you'd care to tell me.\" I spoke off-handedly. This was like\r\nhunting birds on the wing: too abrupt a movement of the glider, and\r\nthe game was lost.\r\n\r\nThis is the story he told me, in the low, modulated voice of the\r\ntrained actor. He told it simply, with no dramatic tricks, no\r\nstressing, no climatic crescendos. But I saw the scenes he described,\r\ndodged with him through black caverns of dread, felt an icy hand\r\nclutch my heart as the Ferret stared at me with his baleful glance;\r\nwas deafened, and stunned, and crushed by that final tremendous down\r\npouring of the waters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was standing--he began--on one of our rafts, watching the\r\ninstallation of a new ray machine. A storm was raging, but the great\r\nraft, a thousand feet long, and five hundred wide, was as steady as a\r\nrock. We were 700 miles out; the great push of '92, that drove us back\r\nto within 150 miles of our coast and almost ended the war, was still\r\neleven weeks off.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the buzzer of my radio-receiver whirred against my chest.\r\n\"2--6--4\"--my personal call. \"2--2\"--\"Go to nearest communications\r\nbooth.\" \"A--4\"--\"Use Intelligence Service intermitter 4.\" The secret\r\nof that was known only to a half-dozen men in the field. Headquarters\r\nwanted to talk to me on a supremely important matter.\r\n\r\nThere was a booth only a short distance away. I stepped to it and\r\nidentified myself to the guard. In a moment I was within and had swung\r\nshut and sealed the sound-proof door. I set the intermitter switches\r\nto the A--4 combination. Not even our own control officers could\r\neavesdrop now. Then I switched off the light, and waited.\r\n\r\nA green glow grew out of the darkness. I was being inspected.\r\nHeadquarters was taking no chances. Out of the green haze before me\r\nthe general himself materialized. I could count every hair in his\r\ngrizzled beard. The little scar at the corner of his left eye\r\nfascinated me with its distinctness.\r\n\r\nI saluted. \"Captain Bolton reporting, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"At ease!\" General Sommers' voice snapped with military precision. The\r\ngeneral was standing in his private office in Washington. I could see\r\nhis desk in the corner, and the great operations map on the wall.\r\nThere were new lines of worry in the general's grim face.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe went straight to the point. \"Captain Bolton, we are confronted with\r\na problem that must be solved at once. While our information is\r\nmeagre, the Staff is convinced that a great danger menaces us. Of its\r\nprecise nature, or how it is to be combatted, we are unaware. I am\r\nassigning you to secure the answer to these two questions.\r\n\r\n\"A week ago there appeared, ten miles east of the enemies' first line,\r\nand directly opposite our raft 1264, what seemed at first to be merely\r\na peculiar cloud formation. It rose directly from the surface of the\r\nwater, and was shaped roughly like half an egg. The greatest\r\ndimension, lying along the water, parallel to the battle line, was\r\nabout 5 miles; the height approximately a mile.\r\n\r\n\"When two or three days had passed, and no change in the shape or\r\ndimensions of the strange mass had taken place, although wind and\r\nweather conditions had been varied, we determined to investigate. This\r\nwas undoubtedly an artificial, not a natural, phenomenon. It was then\r\nthat we discovered that there was a concentration of defenses along\r\nthis portion of the front. Our scouts were unable to find any of the\r\nusual gaps in either the ray network in the upper air, or the\r\ngyro-knife barrier beneath the surface. At the same time, from\r\nscouting parties and deserters at other points we learned that rumors\r\nare rife throughout the enemy forces of some scheme now on foot that\r\nwill overwhelm us within a very short time. No details have been\r\ngiven, but so widespread is the gossip, and so consistent, that we\r\nhave been forced to the conclusion that it cannot be reasonably\r\ndismissed as mere morale-supporting propaganda.\r\n\r\n\"We have secretly developed a method of so equipping aircraft as to\r\nrender them immune to the enemy death ray. The device is complicated\r\nand requires time to manufacture and install. After careful\r\nconsideration, we decided that the situation was sufficiently grave to\r\nwarrant revealing to the enemy our possession of this new device.\r\n\r\n\"The battle-airship _New York_ has been equipped with the new\r\nprotective equipment. To-morrow at sunrise she will make an attack in\r\nforce on whatever lies behind that screen.\r\n\r\n\"Your orders are these. You will proceed at once to raft 1264. You\r\nwill observe the attack made by the _New York_. If she fails, you will\r\nthen find some way to enter that area, discover what is going on\r\nbehind the screen, hamper or destroy the enemy plans if possible and\r\nreport back to me personally.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe general's face suddenly softened. His tones lost their military\r\nprecision. \"I am afraid, Captain, that I am sending you to your death.\r\nBut--we must know what is going on. If the _New York_ fails, the task\r\nwill appear impossible, but you have already done the impossible.\"\r\n\r\nThe grim mask dropped again over the chief's features; again he became\r\nthe perfect military machine. \"You will call on any officer of our\r\nforces for whatever you may need. Here is your authority.\" He stepped\r\naside, and I heard the low burr of the tel-autograph at the side of\r\nthe screen before me. A moment, and the general was again visible.\r\n\r\n\"That will be all.\" Once more the momentary softening. \"Good luck, my\r\nboy.\" A final exchange of salutes, and the screen went blank.\r\n\r\nI switched on the light. There in the little machine was a slip of\r\npaper. I extracted it. The lines of type, the scrawled signature,\r\nburned into my brain like letters of fire.\r\n\r\n     \"To: All Officers of the Military Forces of the Americas.\r\n\r\n      Subject: Military Assistance. Eric Bolton, Captain M.I.S.,\r\n      M.F.A. is authorized to call upon you for any assistance.\r\n      You will comply with his requests.\r\n\r\n      Alton Sommers, Lieut. General Commanding M.I.S., M.F.A.\r\n\r\n      By authority of the Commander in Chief.\"\r\n\r\nIn the corner appeared my thumb-print.\r\n\r\nI stood there for a long time, mulling the thing over. The Staff was\r\nlaying tremendous stress on the enemy's strange cloud formation, even\r\nto the extent of disclosing the secret of the new defensive device.\r\nThe Easterners, too, had something novel, something that would cut off\r\nabsolutely the transmission of ether waves. Nothing either side had\r\nyet produced would do that. What was happening behind that screen?\r\nWould they break through our defenses at last?\r\n\r\nA vision arose before me. Hordes of yellow men, of black, of white\r\nrenegades from the nations where the red flag waved dominant, pouring\r\nover the Americas. The horrors that Britain had undergone, the last\r\nEuropean nation to hold out against the Red horde, flashed into my\r\nmind. I shuddered. Never. It must not be.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was hurled from my feet by an electric shock. A great flood of\r\nsunlight burst in on me. A corner of the booth, three-foot concrete,\r\nhad been sheared away, whiffed into nothingness! I arose and dashed\r\ninto the open. A raid was in progress. The air was electric with the\r\nclashing of opposing barrages. The terrible silence of the pitched\r\nbattles of that war oppressed me. I saw a squad, caught in the beam of\r\nan Eastern ray-projector, destroyed. The end man must have been just\r\non the edge of the beams--half his right side lay twitching on the\r\nground. The rest of him, and the seven others, were smoking heaps of\r\nblackened cinders.\r\n\r\nHigh over No Man's Land--queer how those old phrases last--a covey of\r\nenemy helicopters hung, waiting for the barrage to lift. A black hulk\r\nbroke the surface of the water, split open: then another. Enemy\r\nsub-surface craft. The fight was being waged under water, too. A green\r\nmass spilled its contents as it leaped over the waves and fell back.\r\nOne of ours.\r\n\r\nA huge buzzing came from behind me. A cloud of wasplike forms flew\r\nhigh overhead. It was reserve aircraft, hurrying up from the second\r\nline raft, ten miles west.\r\n\r\nBut this was no affair of mine. I had my orders. I must be in the\r\nNorth Atlantic by daybreak. I looked around. There at the further edge\r\nmy little Zephyr rested, intact. I hurried to her and sprang into the\r\ncockpit. I was off the coast of Chile. Twelve thousand feet would\r\nclear the highest range between. I set the height control. Today you\r\ndon't have to do that, but Mason hadn't perfected his automatic\r\nelevator then. The starting indicator was already set for my position.\r\nI adjusted the direction disk. The little green light showed that the\r\npower broadcast was in operation. I snapped over the starting switch\r\nand the whir of the helicopter vanes overhead told me all was well.\r\nThe machine leaped into the air. Nothing to do now till the warning\r\nbell told me I was within a hundred miles of my destination. The\r\nbattle shot away from me, far below.\r\n\r\nDarkness came swiftly. I was shooting into the eye of the sun at three\r\nhundred miles an hour. I swallowed a few pellets of concentrated food,\r\nthen curled up in my bunk. There was no knowing how many hours would\r\npass till I slept again.\r\n\r\nI fell asleep at once.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe strident clamor of the alarm bell woke me. Dawn was just breaking.\r\nFar below me I could make out the heaving Atlantic, calm and peaceful.\r\nA long line of the huge second-line rafts just underneath, stretching\r\nnorth and south till it curved over the horizon. A bugle's clear notes\r\ncame drifting up to me, reveille. Then I was hovering over my goal,\r\nraft 1264. The black rectangle was alive with activity unwonted at\r\nthis early hour. I took over the controls from the mechanical pilot,\r\nsent my recognition signal and drifted downward.\r\n\r\nThe Zephyr settled on the raft with a soft hiss of the compressed air\r\nshock absorbers. A guard came hurrying up. My credentials passed upon,\r\nI alighted. Momentarily, it was getting brighter. I was just in time.\r\n\r\nI looked eastward, toward the enemy rafts. Beyond them, there it was,\r\njust as General Sommers had described it--a mountain of vapor,\r\ngleaming white in the gathering light. Not at all disquieting; merely\r\na shifting, billowing cloud mass. Rather pretty. The rest of the sky\r\nwas clear, unspecked.\r\n\r\nAs I gazed a line of red fire ran around the edge of the cloud. A\r\nviolet glow suffused the whole, faded swiftly into pink. The sun was\r\nrising. Behind me I heard a huge whirring. Turning, I saw her, just\r\nrising, all the beautiful trim length of her. The _New York_! Pride of\r\nour air fleet!\r\n\r\nFifty paces to my right a little knot of officers caught my attention.\r\nI recognized Jim Bradley. I remembered, someone had told me he was a\r\nmajor, and was commanding a raft. Good. Jim would work with me as he\r\nhad in the old days at Stanford U., when I coached the air polo team\r\nthat he captained. I walked over.\r\n\r\nTime for only a hurried handclasp. The signal corps sergeant,\r\nearphones clamped to his head, was intoning the airship's messages.\r\n\"We have reached the thousand-foot level. Will now head for the\r\nobjective. All well.\"\r\n\r\nWe watched her. She was through our barrage-line. A snapped order from\r\nJim restored the barrier, momentarily lifted to let her pass. A\r\ncurious shimmering blurred the ship's outlines. I called Jim's\r\nattention to it. \"That's the new device, a network of fine wires,\r\ncharged with neutralising vibrations. Worked like a charm in the\r\ntests. But there's no telling how effective it is in actual service.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA cold shiver ran up my spine. Many a fine ship I had seen strike that\r\ninvisible network of rays, and puff into smoke. Was that to be the\r\n_New York's_ fate?\r\n\r\n\"We are about to pass through the enemy barrage. All well,\" came the\r\nsergeant's unemotional monotone, repeating the voice in his ears. I\r\nknew that voice was being listened to in Washington by a little group\r\nwhose every shoulder bore the stars of high command. My thoughts\r\nflashed to them, gazing breathless at the screen that imaged the very\r\nscene before us.\r\n\r\nMy breath stopped. Now! She must be in it now. The next second would\r\ntell the tale. A faint coruscation of sparks ran along the network,\r\nbut the craft kept steadily onward. Thank God!\r\n\r\n\"We have passed through the enemy first-line barrage. All well.\"\r\n\r\nA faint whistling of released breath came from all about me. I was not\r\nthe only one who had agonised at that moment. The first test had been\r\npassed; would the other be as successful?\r\n\r\n\"We are increasing our speed to the maximum. Objective dead ahead. All\r\nwell.\"\r\n\r\nI saw the ship fairly leap through the sky. Five hundred miles an\r\nhour was her greatest speed. Another moment--\r\n\r\n\"We are entering the cloud. Bow is invisible. All--\"\r\n\r\nShe was in it. She lurched. Plunged forward. She was hidden. I turned\r\nto the sergeant. Tremendous concentration was on his bronzed face. He\r\nreached out, twirled a dial in the set before him, and shook his head\r\nslightly. Twirled again. We were knotted around him, our faces\r\nbloodless. He looked up. \"The last sentence was cut off sharp, sir. I\r\ncan hear nothing more. Even the carrier wave is dead.\"\r\n\r\nJim ripped out an oath, snatched the phones, and clamped them over his\r\nown ears. Dead silence.\r\n\r\nAt last he looked up. \"Nothing, gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe looked at each other, appalled.\r\n\r\nBradley handed the apparatus back to the sergeant. \"Remain here,\r\nlistening carefully. Let me know at once if you hear anything.\" The\r\nsergeant saluted.\r\n\r\nOut there the white cloud billowed and gleamed in the sunlight. But\r\nthere was something ominous in its calm beauty now.\r\n\r\nA thought struck me. I spoke, and my voice sounded flat, dead.\r\n\"Perhaps it's only the radio waves that are cut off. Maybe she's all\r\nright, fighting there inside, smashing them.\" But I knew that it was\r\nall over.\r\n\r\n\"God, I hope you're right. Five thousand men aboard her.\" Bradley's\r\nlips were white, his hands trembling. \"Come to my office, Eric; we'll\r\nwait there. To your posts, gentlemen. Each of you will detail a man to\r\nwatch that cloud bank, and report to me any change in its appearance,\r\neven the slightest.\"\r\n\r\nWe walked back to the concrete command-post. We didn't talk, though it\r\nhad been years since we had seen each other. My brain was numbed, I\r\nknow. I had seen plenty of fighting, watched many a man go to his\r\ndeath in the seven months since the war began. But this, somehow, was\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nAn hour passed. Jim busied himself with routine paper work. At least\r\nhe had that relief. I paced about his tiny office. Already I was\r\nmaking plans. Force had failed. Strategy must take its place. I must\r\nget in there. But how?\r\n\r\nBradley looked up from his work, his face grim. \"No news, Eric. If you\r\nwere right we should have heard something from the _New York_ by this\r\ntime. They're gone, all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they're gone,\" I answered. \"It's up to me, then.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe stared in surprise. \"Up to you? What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just that. I'm going in there, God helping.\" I made sure the room was\r\nshut tight against eavesdroppers. Then, briefly as I could, I told him\r\nof my orders, showing him the document I had received the day before.\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"But it's impossible. Their ray network, and the undersea barrier,\r\nare absolutely solid here. I don't think even a mouse could get\r\nthrough. And even if you did get behind their lines, how on earth are\r\nyou going to get into the area underneath that devilish cloud. You saw\r\nwhat happened to the _New York_, protected as she was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I know all that. Nevertheless it's got to be done.\" Just then I\r\ngot the glimmering of an idea. \"Tell me, Jim, are they doing much\r\nscouting here. Undersea, I mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"The usual one-man shell, radio-propelled. We get one once in a while.\r\nMost of them, however, even if we do smash them, are pulled back on\r\nthe wave before we can grab them. It's a bit easier than most places,\r\nthough: our depth's only about six hundred feet.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! Why, I thought the bottom averaged three thousand all along\r\nthe line.\"\r\n\r\n\"It does. But what would be a mountain ridge, if this were dry land,\r\nruns out from the mainland. We're over a big plateau here. It goes on\r\neast another twenty-five miles, or so. See, here's the chart.\"\r\n\r\nA warning bell seemed to ring somewhere within me. Had this peculiar\r\nformation of the ocean bed anything to do with the problem at hand?\r\nBut I kept to the immediate step. My plan was rapidly taking shape in\r\nmy mind.\r\n\r\n\"What are the scouts--black, yellow, or--\"\r\n\r\n\"Russians, mostly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. Now listen, Jim. Send down word that the next scout-sub that is\r\ncaught is not to be ripped, but simply held against the attraction of\r\nthe return wave. The television eye is to be smashed at once, and\r\nradio communication jammed. Can you do it as if something had happened\r\nto the shell?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure thing, but what's the big idea?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll see. I've worked the thing out now.\"\r\n\r\nJust then a red light on Bradley's desk winked three times. \"There's\r\none between the lines now!\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Quick, man, shoot my orders down.\"\r\n\r\nHe pressed a yellow button and spoke quietly but emphatically into a\r\nmouth piece. \"O.K. They understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now take me down.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me as if I had taken leave of my senses, but complied.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe door of the elevator that lowered us from the surface clanged\r\nopen. We stepped out on a balcony that ran around a large, steel-lined\r\nroom. The walls were dripping, and on the floor, twenty feet beneath,\r\na black pool sloshed about with the heaving of the raft, in whose\r\ninterior we were. Rubber-clad soldiers moved about in the blue glow of\r\nthe globes sending down their heatless light from the ceiling. One sat\r\nat a desk near the elevator. As I spied him a green light glowed in\r\nfront of him twice.\r\n\r\n\"They've got him, sir, bringing him in.\"\r\n\r\nA low-toned order. The soldiers sprang to their post. A whirring\r\nsignal. At the other end of the room the steel wall began to move\r\nupward, and water rushed in. A tremendous vibration shook the chamber:\r\na ponderous thudding. The water rose to the level of the balcony and\r\nstopped. I looked at Bradley.\r\n\r\n\"We're beneath the surface, aren't we?\" I asked. \"How is it that the\r\nwater doesn't fill the room?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pumps,\" he replied. \"Tremendous pumps that draw the water out just as\r\nfast as it comes in, and shoot it out again into the sea. We can\r\nmaintain any desired level in here.\"\r\n\r\nThen I noticed that the black flood was rushing by beneath me at a\r\nterrific rate.\r\n\r\nSomething bulked in the opening. Two tiny subs drew in, a black and a\r\ngreen. The steel wall rushed down again, and the vibration ceased.\r\nFrom the green craft heavy grapples extended, clutching the black,\r\nenemy scout. I saw a gaping hole in the black boat's nose, where its\r\neye had been smashed.\r\n\r\nMen were clambering over both vessels' hulls, tugging at the hatchway\r\nfastenings. The black one flew open. I leaped to the deck. Bradley\r\nafter me, and jumped down into the hold.\r\n\r\nIn the little cubby-hole that was all the machinery left space for, a\r\npale-faced form in green-gray crouched against the wall. His eyes\r\nstared in fear. A Russian, praise be. And not far from my size and\r\nbuild.\r\n\r\n\"Off with his clothes, quick!\" I yelled, stripping mine as I spoke.\r\nBradley looked at me queerly, and shrugged his shoulders. \"Quick, man!\r\nEverything depends on speed!\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, as one who listens to the vaporings of an imbecile,\r\nbut turned to obey. I was standing there--naked, studying the\r\nEasterner's face, his body. No scars. Good.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJim turned to me, the prisoner's clothing in his hands. An exclamation\r\nburst from him. He looked back at the trembling Russ, then at me. \"My\r\nGod, Eric, how did you do it?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nI smiled. \"All right, is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're his twin; no, you're himself! If I'd had a drink to-day I'd be\r\nsure I was seeing double. How on earth--you had no make-up, no time--\"\r\n\r\nI was sliding into the Red's gear as I talked! \"I've trained all the\r\nlittle muscles in my face--muscles you others don't even know you\r\nhave. Started when I was a kid, then made a good living at it, acting.\r\nComes in handy now, damn handy. I can make anything of my face, and\r\nhold it forever if I have to. Chink, Russ--anything. Distort my limbs\r\ntoo, and change my voice. That won't be necessary now. Simple, but it\r\ntakes a lot of practice.\"\r\n\r\nI was dressed by then, a counterpart of the enemy officer--I hoped. If\r\nI wasn't--well, I wouldn't live much longer.\r\n\r\n\"Now, out with the Russ and my clothes. Don't leave a bit, if you\r\nvalue my life.\"\r\n\r\nA light of comprehension illumined Jim's face. \"You're going to pass\r\nyourself off as this man? You've got your nerve with you!\" he\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.\" The cubby-hole was clear now. \"Now take that spanner, and\r\nbang me over the head. Not too hard; I don't want a cracked skull,\r\nonly a splashed scalp. Then pile me where it will seem I crashed\r\nagainst a projection of some kind when the grapples took hold. That\r\nbunk edge will do. Batten the hatch, and cast off the grapples. I hope\r\ntheir automatic control is still working, otherwise my scheme's\r\ngaflooey.\"\r\n\r\nJim stuck out his great paw. \"Good luck, Eric,\" he said, simply. Then\r\nhe clutched the spanner. I saw it go over my head....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVoices around me, harsh, guttural voices. Russian! By the Nine Dogs of\r\nWar, I had pulled it off! But what were they saying? I was inside the\r\nlines, but was my deception successful? Or had my face relaxed with\r\nthe shock of the blow? I thanked my Russian grandmother then for all\r\nthe time she had spent teaching me her mother tongue.\r\n\r\n\"_Boszhe moi_, the poor fellow must have had an awful smash. He hasn't\r\ncome to yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"The doctor will be here in a minute. He'll revive him.\"\r\n\r\nI breathed a prayer of gratitude. They didn't suspect! But I didn't\r\nlike this doctor business. Well, I'd have to stall through that as\r\nbest I could.\r\n\r\nI seemed to be lying on hard rock. I opened my eyes, staring blankly,\r\nstraight up. A bearded face was bending over me, the captain's crossed\r\nsickles on the shoulder straps just within my vision. Behind, and\r\nabove him, towering straight up--my God!--what was it? A green wall, a\r\nvertical green wall, going up and up! It looked like--but no: how\r\ncould water stand straight up like that, for hundreds of feet?\r\n\r\nI almost betrayed myself with a gasp! A dim bulk showed in the\r\ntranslucent depths of the wall. It rushed toward me, took form. A\r\nfish, a huge, blind fish, its cavernous mouth stretched wide. It came\r\nstraight for me, just above. In a second it would leap through. A\r\nscream of terror trembled in my throat. Then it hit the edge of the\r\ntranslucent green wall--and vanished! Was I dreaming? Had Jim hit me\r\ntoo hard?\r\n\r\nSomething stirred in the back of my mind. I sensed dimly that here lay\r\nthe explanation of the disappearance of the _New York_, the very\r\nmystery that I had come to solve. Almost I had it; then it slipped\r\naway.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Here's the doctor!\" someone said. There was a little stir of activity\r\nabout me. I allowed my eyes to close, as if in utter weariness.\r\n\r\n\"What's all this? What have you got here?\" A gruff voice, intolerant.\r\n\r\n\"One of our sub-sea scouts, sir. Just come back, after some delay. Her\r\neye was smashed, and there are grapple marks on her. Must have been\r\ncaught, and then slipped away. She was leaking badly. We got her\r\nthrough the lock just in time.\" Jim had evidently added a few touches\r\nof his own. \"Comrade Pauloff seems to have been seriously injured.\r\nHe's got a bad cut on his scalp, and was unconscious till a moment\r\nago. Opened his eyes just as you came along.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hm. Let's see.\" I felt a none too gentle hand finger my wound. It\r\nthrobbed maddeningly. The doctor spoke again. \"A nasty crack, but no\r\nfracture. Here, you--wake up.\" I made no move. \"Come on, wake up!\" I\r\nheard the plop of a cork being drawn from a bottle; a pungent odor\r\nassailed my nostrils, choked me. I writhed, pulled at the hand holding\r\nthe bottle to my nose and opened my eyes.\r\n\r\n\"That's better. How do you feel now?\"\r\n\r\nI raised a hand to my injury and muttered, in Russian. \"Hurts,\r\npapashka.\" I kept my expression as blank, as uncomprehending, as I\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nThe doctor flashed an understanding glance at the captain, then turned\r\nback to me. \"What's your name?\"\r\n\r\nMemories of my grandmother's tales of her youth came flooding back to\r\nme. \"Pavel, son of Pauloff.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the formula of the Russian student, in his teens.\r\n\r\n\"Your rank?\"\r\n\r\n\"Second year. Petrovski Gymnasium.\"\r\n\r\nThe physician turned away. \"No use bothering him now. A clear case of\r\namnesia.\r\n\r\n\"He's been thrown back to his high school days. I've had a number of\r\ncases like that among your scouts lately.\" Blessed inspiration! \"Only\r\ncure is rest. Get him over to the infirmary. We'll evacuate him to a\r\nbase hospital to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was in a cool white bed, in a low ceilinged room, white painted.\r\nThere were other beds, vacant. A uniformed male nurse puttered around.\r\nThere was an elusive green tinge to the light that poured in through\r\nthe one window.\r\n\r\nThe door opened and a sergeant came in. \"Comrade Alexis!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what is it now? Have they found another gold-bricking officer\r\nto mess up my clean beds?\"\r\n\r\n\"A party from corps headquarters will be here in fifteen minutes for\r\ninspection.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let them come. They won't find any specks of rust on my instruments,\r\nlike they did on Comrade Borisoff's.\"\r\n\r\n\"They'd better not. You know what happened to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah. Chucked into the ray. Well, he didn't give the burial squad any\r\nwork.\" And the two laughed, a laugh that had more than a hint of\r\nsadistic cruelty in it. \"If I had my way,\" the nurse went on, \"I'd do\r\nthe same with all these nuts that come back from the scout ships\r\nraving of home and mother. It's my idea that they're all bluffing.\r\nIt's a good way to be shipped to the rear, where the captured dames\r\nare. Say, did I tell you about the last time I was on leave--\"\r\n\r\nThe two whispered, their heads close together. My brain was working\r\nfrantically. Things had gone well so far, but I had to get out of here\r\nbefore the morning, or I'd be sent to the base and lose all that I had\r\ngained by my daring.\r\n\r\nThe door snapped open. \"_Smirnow!_\" (Atten-_shun!_)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was on my side, facing away from the wall. I remained so, staring\r\nblankly across the room. I hoped the inspection would be over quickly.\r\nThe fewer the enemy officers I had looking me over, the better.\r\nSomeone back there was snapping questions. That voice--where had I\r\nheard it before?\r\n\r\n\"Your patient. What's his trouble?\"\r\n\r\n\"Amnesia, sir. One of the scouts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. Let's look at him.\"\r\n\r\nSomeone was walking across the room, then standing above me. His hand\r\nwas just at the level of my eyes--a hand with the little finger\r\ntwisted queerly into the palm. I knew that hand: it was the\r\n_Ferret's_! A cold shiver ran up my back. I almost stopped breathing.\r\n\r\nOf all the infernal luck in the world, to have the Ferret walk in\r\nhere! He was chief of the Red's Intelligence Service, the shrewdest,\r\nsharpest, cruelest of them all. Many of our best men had gone west\r\nbecause of his uncanny instinct for piercing disguise. They said he\r\ncould _smell_ an American. And many of our most strictly guarded plans\r\nhad been smashed through his infernally clever spying. Only a month\r\nbefore I had him in my clutches; saw the very rope around his neck.\r\nBut he had slipped away, and left me empty-handed and kicking myself\r\nfor an ass.\r\n\r\nI held my breath as I felt those gimlet eyes of his boring into me.\r\nWould he sense who I was? Surely he could hear the pounding of my\r\nheart. How long he stood there I don't know. It seemed like hours. I\r\ntautened, waiting for him to call out, determined to sell my life as\r\ndearly as I could.\r\n\r\nBut for once the Ferret was fooled. He turned away. \"Take us into your\r\nkitchen,\" he snapped at the nurse, then there was the tramping of feet\r\nand the slamming of a door.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe breath whistled from me in relief. I turned cautiously. I was\r\nalone. Now was my chance. I jumped from the bed and started toward the\r\nwindow. Once out, I'd find some place to hide. I let my face relax;\r\nthere was no use for that particular disguise any longer. The window\r\nwas up. I was on the sill. Another second and I'd be out in the open.\r\n\r\n\"Just where do you think you're going?\" came the Ferret's silky, cruel\r\nvoice. I whirled. There he was, just inside the door. His little black\r\neyes glinted dangerously over his hooked nose and sharp chin.\r\n\r\n\"Oh--Bolton! Something made me turn back. Glad to see you.\"\r\n\r\nHis hand flashed to the ray-tube in his belt. At the same moment I\r\nleft the window sill in a desperate leap. Clear across the room I\r\nsprang, and before he had time to pull his weapon I had one hand\r\nclamped around his wrist, the other clutching his throat. We crashed\r\nto the ground.\r\n\r\nI was in pyjamas, barefooted, he fully clothed. His leather shoes\r\ndrove into me viciously, even as his face turned purple. The pain was\r\nexcruciating, but I dared not cry out. His left thumb found my eye,\r\nwas digging in.\r\n\r\nThe crash of our fall must have been heard outside; another moment and\r\nall would be lost. I was momentarily on top as we rolled across the\r\nfloor. With a supreme effort I pulled his head away from the floor,\r\nthen crashed it down. He slumped; lay still.\r\n\r\nThe door knob was turning as I jumped frantically through the window.\r\nI heard a cry behind me. Rough, uneven ground. No one about. To my\r\nright was a rocky cliff, and at its base what looked like the mouth of\r\na cave. Any port in a storm: I dived into it.\r\n\r\nIt was a cave, all right, or rather a narrow tunnel winding some\r\ndistance into the cliff. I ran back at top speed, till I crashed into\r\nthe end of the passage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI crouched there, panting. It was beastly cold, and the dampness\r\nstruck into my bones. I shivered, then laughed grimly. I wouldn't\r\nshiver long. When the Ferret came to and revealed that Eric Bolton was\r\naround, there wouldn't be a stone left unturned till I was found.\r\nThose birds had good cause to want me rubbed out.\r\n\r\nAlready I could hear faint shouts from without. The chase was on. I\r\nwas caught, right enough. Trapped like any rat.\r\n\r\nI felt around me in the darkness and my hand lighted on a round stone.\r\nIt just fitted my fist. Well, I'd get one of them, anyway, when they\r\nfound me. Cold comfort in that, but I didn't feel like giving in\r\ntamely.\r\n\r\nFootsteps sounded out at the tunnel end. So soon! I gripped my rock\r\ntightly, and waited.\r\n\r\nBut--it sounded like only one man. I drew myself together. Maybe I had\r\na chance. A dim glow showed where the passage curved, then a disk of\r\nlight flashed on the wall and flitted about. The fool!\r\n\r\nThe steps came on, slowly, stumblingly. The disk of light grew\r\nsmaller as its source drew nearer. Then he was around the corner,\r\nbulked for a moment against his own light as it was reflected from the\r\nwet wall. That moment was enough! The stone left my hand with all the\r\nforce I possessed. It went straight to its mark: a sickening thud told\r\nme that. The form dropped, and the flashlight clinked on the rocks.\r\n\r\nI listened. Still the shouts from without, but no steps inside. I was\r\nsafe for a time. But the searcher would surely be missed, and others\r\nwould come looking for him. I had only one chance. I shrugged my\r\nshoulders. I couldn't lose anything. If I stayed here my goose was\r\ncooked.\r\n\r\nBy the light of the flashlight I examined my quarry. A renegade\r\nFrenchman, apparently. A private. In a trice I had his uniform on me\r\nand had twisted my features to match his. Little did I think when I\r\nacted under the Klieg lights that the fate of two continents would\r\nsome day depend on this gift of mine.\r\n\r\nHe stirred; groaned. I hesitated. Then--well, I couldn't chance his\r\ncrawling out. His ray-tube was newly charged. I left a heap of ashes\r\nthere as I walked away....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was outside the cave. I darted a glance around. My refuge was not\r\nthe only hole in sheer rock; it was literally honeycombed. From one,\r\nthen another of the cavern mouths a soldier emerged. Each strode\r\nacross the uneven, rocky plain to where an officer stood with what was\r\napparently a map in his hand. As each searcher saluted and reported,\r\nthe officer made a mark on the map. Someone came out from the\r\ncave-mouth next to mine. I fell in behind him.\r\n\r\n\"No one in cave twenty-one, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"To your post.\"\r\n\r\nThe private turned on his heel and marched off to take his place in a\r\ncompany formation that was rapidly taking shape near by. My turn was\r\nnext. What was the number of my cave? A mistake now, and I was\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nI saluted. \"No one in cave twenty, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"To your post.\"\r\n\r\nHad I hit it? When the final check-up came would there be two reports\r\nfor one cave, none for another?\r\n\r\nA front rank man moved aside. Good: that meant my place was just\r\nbehind him. My luck was holding. And never did a man need luck more!\r\n\r\nNow was my first chance to look about, to discover what sort of place\r\nthis was. It was an oval plain, roughly a mile wide by five miles\r\nlong. Buildings, squat structures of corrugated iron, were scattered\r\nhere and there. In the distance, to my left, what seemed a great hole\r\nin the ground glowed; a huge disk of light.\r\n\r\nDry land, here, where there should be nothing but a waste of waters!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPuzzled, I strained to see what bordered the plain. It was a tall\r\ncliff, running all around, and towering high in the air. But it wasn't\r\nrock, for it glowed strangely green in the flood of light that\r\nillumined the place. And it was clean cut, rising sheer from the\r\nunevenness of the ground.\r\n\r\nThen I remembered. The vertical green wall that soared above me as I\r\nlay dazed from Jim's blow. The translucent green wall in whose depths\r\nI had seen the blind fish rushing toward me. Water! The sea!\r\nImpossible! There were scientific miracle-workers in the enemy's\r\nranks, but they couldn't have hollowed out a pit such as this in\r\nmid-ocean; forced back the very ocean to create this amphitheatre,\r\nthis dry plain on the Atlantic's very bottom: held back the\r\nunthinkable weight of Earth's waters by a nothingness. Incredible!\r\n\r\nYet the accomplished fact stared me in the face.\r\n\r\nMy eyes traveled up that impossible wall. It must have been at least\r\nsix hundred feet high. At its summit, in a murky haze that heaved and\r\nbillowed, I made out strange, dim bulks that hung, unsupported. A long\r\nline of them, a long ellipse following closely the curving of the\r\ncliff. Underneath the nearest, barely perceptible, I could make out a\r\nlens-shaped cage of wire. I began to understand.\r\n\r\nOverarching everything was a great dome of heaving cloud.\r\n\r\n\"_Smirn-ow!_\"\r\n\r\nThe long line snapped into immobility.\r\n\r\n\"By the left flank, march!\"\r\n\r\nWe were moving, marching. Then my ruse had succeeded. I had chosen the\r\nright cave number. I breathed a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe command for route order was given, and at once a buzz of talk\r\nbroke out around me. \"Damn them, they're sending us right off to work!\r\nWe missed our mess, hunting for that damned spy. But that don't mean\r\nanything. It's back to the tunnel for ours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, quit your bellyaching, Andreyeff. Another week, and we'll be in\r\nNew York. Just think of it, the richest city in the world to loot! And\r\nwomen! Why, they tell me the American women are to the Frenchies and\r\nthe cold English-women as the sun is to the stars. What's a meal more\r\nor less when you think of that?\"\r\n\r\nAn obscene laugh swept through the ranks. Guttural voices boasted of\r\npast exploits--black deeds and sadistic cruelties that had marked the\r\ntrail of the hordes sweeping over Europe from the windy Asiatic\r\nsteppes.\r\n\r\nAs we marched, I noticed a peculiarity of the rocky floor. There were\r\nno sharp edges, no sudden cleavages in the uneven terrain. It looked,\r\nfor all the world, as though the stone had been melted, then frozen\r\nagain in a moment. An unbelievable pattern was forming itself in my\r\nmind. If what I thought were true--!\r\n\r\nThe command came to halt.\r\n\r\nWe had reached the blazing disk I had seen from afar. It was a\r\ntremendous shaft, dropping straight into the very bowels of the earth.\r\nTwo hundred feet across, a blinding glare streamed up from the pit.\r\nFrom far beneath came shoutings, the clank of machinery, a growling\r\nroar.\r\n\r\nOther companies marched up and halted at the pit edge. My outfit were\r\nwhites--Russians, French, Germans. But the others were black, brown,\r\nyellow--all the motley aggregation of races that formed the Red\r\ncohorts, the backbone of the Great Uprising. As the \"At ease\" order\r\nsnapped out a babel of tongues rose on the air. Every language of\r\nEarth was there save English. The Anglo-Saxons had chosen tortured\r\ndeath rather than submission to the commands of their conquerors.\r\n\r\nA huge platform rose slowly up in the shaft and came to a stop at the\r\nground level. It was solidly packed with another throng of soldiers in\r\nthe gray-green of the enemy. They marched off and we took their place.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDown, down, we went, till it seemed that our destination was the\r\ncenter of the earth. Louder and louder grew the growling roar, the\r\nponderous thud and clank of huge machines.\r\n\r\nWe were in a huge chamber, hollowed out of the solid rock. Thousands\r\nof men bustled out among great piles of lumber and steel rails. Huge\r\ncranes rolled here and there, swinging their ponderous loads.\r\nOfficers shouted crisp orders. Green-uniformed privates sprang to\r\nobey.\r\n\r\nBut no time was given me to get more than a glimpse of all this\r\nactivity. From out the gaping mouth of a hundred-foot-wide tunnel a\r\nlong train of flat cars came gliding. It halted and swayed on the\r\nsingle rail, and the whir of the gyroscopic balancers filled the\r\ncavern. A sharp order, and my companions leaped for the cars, lay\r\nprone on the steel car-beds, and passed their belts through projecting\r\nloops. I wondered, but imitated them. I buried my face in my arms, as\r\nthe others were doing.\r\n\r\nThere came the eery shriek of a siren: the train was moving. Swiftly\r\nit gathered speed till it seemed as though my protesting body was\r\nbeing forced through a wall of air grown suddenly solid. Myriad\r\nfingers pulled at me, seeking to hurl me to destruction. Even through\r\nmy protecting arms my breath was forced back into my lungs, choking\r\nme. The wind howled past with the wail of a thousand souls in torment.\r\n\r\nJust as the limit of endurance was reached the terrific speed\r\nslackened, and the long train ground to a halt. \"All off! Lively now!\"\r\ncame the command.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe were at the rail-head, and before me was the face of the tunnel.\r\nQueer, hooded figures were there bending over wheeled tripods,\r\nmanipulating what appeared to be searchlights. But no shafts of light\r\nleaped from the lenses. The tripods were rolling steadily forward.\r\n\r\nI looked at the tunnel face again, then, startled, back to the hooded\r\nmen. I rubbed my eyes. Was I seeing things? No, by all that was holy,\r\nit was so! The distance between the machines and the end wall of the\r\npassage had not changed, but men and rock were ten--fifteen--twenty\r\nfeet away! They were boring; boring into the solid rock at tremendous\r\nspeed. _And the rock was melting, vanishing, disappearing into\r\nnothingness in the awful blast projected from those machines!_\r\n\r\nI gaped--my pose, my danger, forgotten. Almost as fast as a man could\r\nrun, the tunnel extended itself. It was phantasmal, incredible!\r\n\r\nA rough hand seized me from behind. I whirled, my heart in my mouth.\r\nIt was the burly sergeant. \"What the hell are you dreaming about,\r\nRenaud? Hop to it. Over there, on that shoring job. Get busy now,\r\nor--\" The threat in that unfinished sentence chilled me by its very\r\nvagueness.\r\n\r\nMy squad was hauling heavy timbers, setting them up where a fault\r\nshowed in the rocky roof of the tunnel. I joined them but my thoughts\r\nwere a madly whirling chaos.\r\n\r\nThe pattern was complete now. The long, curving under-water ridge on\r\nJim's chart--this tunnel was boring through it. Whatever it was that\r\nthose tripods projected--a new ray it must be--it was _melting_ a\r\npassage six hundred miles long. Under our rafts, under our fleets,\r\nunder our coast defenses--to come up far behind our lines. The ridge\r\njoined the coast just south of New York. Some night, while our\r\ngenerals slept in smug complacency, all that gray green horde of\r\nwolves would belch forth--from the very earth.\r\n\r\nAnd the Americans would follow Europe into hell!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFive minutes passed. I looked again at the face of the tunnel, drawn\r\nby an irresistible fascination. It had advanced a full quarter of a\r\nmile. Like fog before a cloud-piercing searchlight, the age-old rock\r\nwas dissolving before the ray. At this rate America's doom would be\r\nsealed in a week. And I, alone among these thousands, was helpless to\r\navert the climaxing menace.\r\n\r\nA howl of rage came from the sergeant. I turned. A diminutive German,\r\nhis face pale green with fatigue, had stumbled and fallen under the\r\nweight of a heavy timber.\r\n\r\nThe swarthy non-com was kicking him with a cruel boot. \"Get up, you;\r\nget up before I brain you!\"\r\n\r\nThe sprawling man looked up, fear staring from his deep-sunk eyes.\r\n\"_Aber, ich bin krank._\"--\"I am sick; I can't stand the work; it is\r\ntoo _schwer_, too heavy,\" he faltered.\r\n\r\n\"Sick?\" the Russian roared. \"Sick? I'll sick you! You're lazy, too\r\ndamned lazy to do a little work. I'm tired of this gold-bricking\r\naround here. I'm going to make an example of you that the rest of you\r\ndogs won't forget in a hurry.\" His face was purple with rage. He bent,\r\nseized the fallen man and dragged him out from under the crushing\r\nbulk. Then, raising the struggling wretch over his head as lightly as\r\nthough he were an infant, he ran forward, toward the ray projectors.\r\n\r\nShriek after shriek pierced the hot air, such howls of utter fear and\r\nagony, as I hope never to hear again. The little figure, held high in\r\nthe huge paws, writhed and tossed, to no avail.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant reached the nearest tripod. His brawny arms flexed;\r\nstraightened. The German swept up and over the head of the operator,\r\nand dropped in front of the machine. Then--he vanished. Nothing,\r\nabsolutely nothing, was there between projector and rapidly retreating\r\nwall!\r\n\r\nA horrible retching tore my stomach; I swayed dizzily. The utter\r\nbrutality, the finality of the thing! \"And any more of you carrion\r\nthat I catch slacking will get the same thing,\" the Russian said.\r\n\"You, Renaud, I've got my eye on you. Watch out!\" The sergeant's voice\r\nrasped through the mist about me. I shoved my shoulder under one end\r\nof an eight by eight and plunged into the back breaking labor. But one\r\nthought hammered at my reeling brain: \"The _New York_! That's what\r\nhappened to her!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe long hours of toil at last ended. We were again in the entrance\r\ncavern, waiting for the elevator platform. It was unaccountably\r\ndelayed: the last batch had gone up fifteen minutes before. The men\r\nabout me chafed and swore. They were impatient for mess and bed.\r\n\r\nBit by bit I had reconstructed all the elements of this unprecedented\r\noperation. The ray, the blasting ray that whiffed into non-existence\r\nall that it touched, was the keynote. The great plain had been cleared\r\nby the ray. The dim shapes floating high in that far-circling ellipse\r\nwere pouring down the dreadful vibrations, thus holding back the sea\r\nin a marvelous green wall. I remembered the sea-monster that had\r\ndashed at me and vanished. That proved it. The dome of cloud was\r\ncamouflage, or the product of the processes of destruction going on\r\nunderneath: it didn't matter. What mattered was that it was interlaced\r\nby a network of ray beams. It was an impenetrable wall, a perfect\r\ndefense. Boxed in on all sides by such a barrier, how was I to get out\r\nword of the menace? How was it to be combatted even if our forces knew\r\nof the danger? A hundred plans flooded my wearied brain, to be\r\nrejected one by one.\r\n\r\nA mocking, ribald cheer arose from the men around me. The platform was\r\nascending. Why the long delay? A premonition of disaster chilled me. I\r\nshrugged it aside.\r\n\r\nWe were at the top. A long line of soldiers curved about the mouth of\r\nthe pit. The next shift waiting to go down? No--they made no move to\r\napproach. And each one was holding his ray-tube at the ready. This was\r\nthe guard. At a table nearby a knot of officers was gathered. Papers\r\nof some sort were piled high on it. Again the icy finger of dread\r\ntouched me. One of the officers moved aside, revealing the profile of\r\nhis companion. The Ferret. Then I knew I was done for!\r\n\r\nMy eyes darted here and there, seeking escape. No hope--the heavily\r\narmed guard was all around; the platform blocked the shaft mouth. A\r\ndash would be self-betrayal--suicide.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMechanically I obeyed the sergeant's barked commands. We were in\r\nsingle file. We were moving toward that ominous table where the Ferret\r\nstood, a sardonic smile on his sharp-featured face. I could make out a\r\nlivid weal across his throat. I had left my mark on him. That was some\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe head of the line reached the table. They were fingerprinting the\r\nleader! A lieutenant extracted a paper from the pile and handed it to\r\nthe Ferret. He made momentary comparison of something on the paper\r\nwith the mark the soldier had just made. Then the next man stepped up,\r\nwhile the first made off across the plain.\r\n\r\nOf course! Simple: how very simple! And yet it had caught me! The\r\nservice records of the men had their fingerprints, just as in our own\r\nforces. And each man in the area was being checked up. Trust the\r\nFerret to think of that. He knew that I'd be somewhere in their ranks,\r\nimpersonating one of their men. Well, I was in for it. The last trick\r\nin our long game was his.\r\n\r\nMy turn. No use going through the motions. I bent down a moment, then\r\nstraightened. \"Oh, hello, Bolton,\" the Ferret said, thrusting out his\r\nhand, the one with the twisted finger. I had resumed my own visage.\r\n\"Didn't think you could get away with it, did you?\"\r\n\r\nChagrined as I was, I put a good face on it. The Ferret and I had run\r\nup against each other many many times. Cheerfully, either of us would\r\nhave cut the other's throat. But--we played the game.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Rubinoff,\" I responded. \"You seem to have me, just now. But\r\ntry and hold me.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ferret threw back his head and laughed. \"Oh, I think you'll find\r\nit a little difficult to get away this time.\" I thought so, too, but\r\ndid not voice my thought.\r\n\r\nThe smile left Rubinoff's face. He snapped an order. A squad advanced\r\nfrom the guard. Handcuffs clicked around my wrists, the mates of each\r\nwere fastened to the arms of two guardsmen. I was securely chained.\r\nThey were taking no chances.\r\n\r\n\"Take him to the special cell in the guard-house.\" The lieutenant\r\nsaluted. I was marched off. Then I was not to be summarily executed. I\r\nwas not as much relieved as you might think. You see, I knew the\r\nFerret. We had raided one of his hangouts once; just missed him. But\r\nwe found an M.I.S. man there whom Rubinoff had been--questioning. We\r\nthanked God when he died.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe tramped across the plain. My eyes kept roving about: there wasn't\r\nmuch hope for me, but miracles have happened. Most of the scattered\r\nstructures were hastily thrown together sheds of sheet iron. Barracks,\r\nthey looked like. But, every so often I spied spheres of concrete, the\r\nwide open doors revealing yard-thick walls. What could be their\r\npurpose?\r\n\r\nSomething bothered me. Something about the ray projectors and the\r\nother machinery I had seen. I glanced up at one of the balloons\r\nfloating high above. All these needed a power supply; tremendous power\r\nto accomplish what the ray was doing. And there were no cables\r\nrunning to them. How did the power get to them?\r\n\r\nThere was only one answer. Radio transmission. The required energy,\r\nperhaps the very ray vibrations themselves, were being broadcast to\r\nthe points of projection. That meant a power-house and a control room\r\nsomewhere in the area. _The vulnerable points!_ Where were they?\r\n\r\nI stumbled, and was jerked roughly to my feet. The lieutenant slapped\r\nme. \"Scared, Americansky? You well may be. We'll have rare sport when\r\nthey throw what the Ferret leaves of you into the ray.\" I shuddered.\r\nTo go out that way! I'll be honest--I was horribly afraid. The men to\r\nwhom I was shackled laughed.\r\n\r\nA dull throbbing beat at my ears, a vibration just too low to be\r\nsound. I looked about for its source. It came from my left--a concrete\r\nbuilding, low lying, about a hundred yards long by as many feet wide.\r\nAt the further end a squat smokestack broke the flat line of the roof.\r\nGuards, many guards, were pacing their slow patrol about it. From the\r\ncenter of the side nearest me, cables thick as a man's trunk issued\r\nforth. I followed them with my eye. They ended in a marble slab on\r\nwhich rested a concrete sphere, somewhat larger than the others. The\r\ndoor of this one was closed. On the roof of the queer edifice was a\r\npeculiar arrangement of wires, gleaming in the artificial daylight.\r\nThis building, too, was heavily guarded.\r\n\r\nI had found what I sought--the power-house and the transmitting\r\nstation. Much good it did me--now.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy warders turned sharply to the right. I glimpsed another concrete\r\nstructure. A heavy steel door opened, then clanged shut, behind us.\r\nThe fetid odor that means only one thing the world over, folded round\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI sprawled on the steel floor of the cell into which I was thrust. A\r\nwave of utter fatigue engulfed me. I felt great weariness of body and\r\ndespair of soul. I had failed in my mission. The fate of my country\r\nhad been entrusted to me--and here I was in a steel-floored,\r\nsteel-walled prison cell. And that tunnel was rushing toward New York\r\nat three miles an hour; over seventy miles a day.\r\n\r\nI think I slept from sheer exhaustion. But something startled me into\r\nawaking. The dim light filtering in from the tiny air-hole high up on\r\none wall showed me that I was still alone. I lay, listening. There it\r\nwas again, a wailing scream of agony that rose and fell and died away.\r\n\r\nI heard a grating sound at the door, and it opened and shut. Rubinoff,\r\nthe Ferret, had entered. \"Comfortable, Captain Bolton?\" he asked, and\r\nthere was more than a hint of mockery in the velvety voice. In the\r\nhand with the twisted finger was his ray-tube. It pointed steadily at\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI got to my feet. I was in no mood for trifling, for that scream had\r\nshaken me. \"Cut the comedy, Rubinoff.\" I growled. \"Kill me, and let's\r\nhave done with it.\"\r\n\r\nHe raised a deprecating hand. \"Oh, come now. There's really no\r\nabsolute necessity for that. You can save yourself, very easily.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can use you, if you're amenable to reason.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're the cleverest of the American Intelligence men. The rabble\r\nthey give me are well-nigh useless. Cast your lot in with us, and in a\r\nweek you'll have the riches of your greatest city to dip your hands\r\nin. It's easy. There is certain information we need. Give it to us.\r\nThen I'll get you back into your lines: we'll cook up a good tale for\r\nSommers. You can resume your post and send us information only when it\r\nis of extreme importance. Come, now, be sensible.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt first blush this was an astounding proposal. But I knew my man. He\r\nneeded to know something. Once he had extracted the knowledge he\r\nsought from me, I should be disposed of. He'd never let me get back\r\ninto our lines with what I had found out. It might have been policy to\r\nplay him--but what was the use?\r\n\r\n\"No, Rubinoff. You know I won't do it.\"\r\n\r\nHe sighed. \"Just as I thought. Honor, country, and so on. Well, it's\r\ntoo bad. We should have made a wonderful team. However, you'll tell me\r\nwhat I want to know. What are the defenses within fifty miles of New\r\nYork?\"\r\n\r\nI laughed derisively.\r\n\r\n\"You'll save yourself a lot of trouble if you tell me, Bolton. After\r\nall, death in the ray isn't so bad. Whiff--and you're gone. Don't\r\nforce me to other measures.\" There was a grim threat in his voice. But\r\nI simply shook my head.\r\n\r\n\"Stubborn, like all the other Anglo-Saxons. Well, I've got something\r\nto show you.\" He raised his weapon and glanced at it. \"Pretty little\r\nthing, this. Not the ordinary ray-tube. Only field officers have\r\nthese. Look.\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed it at the wall from behind which that scream had come and\r\npressed the trigger button. A tiny round hole appeared in the steel.\r\n\r\n\"Neat, isn't it? Utilizes the same ray you saw at work in the tunnel.\r\nThe Zeta-ray we call it. Just think what that would do to human\r\nflesh.\" I said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"But that isn't what I had in mind. Just look through that hole.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI wanted to see what was on the other side, so I obeyed. The Thing\r\nthat lay on the floor within--could it ever have been a man? I whirled\r\nback to the Ferret in a fury, my fists clenched.\r\n\r\nHis infernal weapon was pointing straight at me. \"Softly, Bolton,\r\nsoftly. You'd never get to me.\" I checked my spring, for he was right.\r\n\"How'd you like that?\" he purred.\r\n\r\n\"Some of your work, I suppose,\" I growled.\r\n\r\n\"The poor fool was fomenting a mutiny. We wanted to know the other\r\nplotters. He was stubborn. What would you? Necessity knows no law....\r\nWhat are the defenses around New York?\" He advanced menacingly.\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n\"Why be a fool? This ray hurts, I tell you, when it's properly\r\napplied. How would you like to be melted away, piece by little piece,\r\ntill you're like that in there?\"\r\n\r\nI shrugged my shoulders, but kept silent.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you it hurts. You don't believe me? That in there is\r\nunconscious, seven-eighths dead. Listen.\"\r\n\r\nHe bored another hole in the steel, keeping his finger pressed on the\r\ntrigger. Again that heart-rending scream of agony rang out, tearing\r\nits way through me. My brain exploded in red rage. I leaped for the\r\nfiend, reckless of consequences. My fist drove into the leering face\r\nwith all the force of my spring, with all the insane fury that his\r\nheartless cruelty had roused in me. Smack!--he catapulted across the\r\nfloor and crashed into the wall! I was on him, my hand clutching for\r\nhis tube. But there was no need. He was out--dead to the world. So\r\nsudden, so unexpected was my mad attack that even he had not had time\r\nto meet it.\r\n\r\nI worked fast. In a minute I was in Rubinoff's uniform and had assumed\r\nhis face. I was a little taller; no matter. But the finger--that\r\nwould be noticed immediately. There was only one thing to do. I stuck\r\nmy little finger through one of the holes he had made in the wall and\r\ntwisted. Crack! Beads of agony stood out on my forehead, but the break\r\nwas just right. By bending the other fingers slightly I could hold\r\nthat one in just the position of his.\r\n\r\nI picked up the ray-tube with my left hand. If I went out through the\r\nguard-house entrance I might meet other officers and be engaged in\r\nconversation. That might lead to discovery. My cell was on the side of\r\nthe prison away from the road; I had noticed no buildings behind it:\r\nI'd chance it. Luck had been with me so far.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI carved out a hole in the wall pierced by the air-hole. It was like\r\ncutting through butter with a red hot knife. I stepped out.\r\n\r\nThere was no one about. I walked carelessly around the corner of the\r\nbuilding, my hand, holding the tube, buried deep in my pocket. Not far\r\naway was the spherical structure I had spotted as the control room. I\r\nreturned salutes. No one stopped to talk to me. Would the guard before\r\nthat building require a pass-word?\r\n\r\nI heard a shout behind me. My escape was discovered! At once I broke\r\ninto a run and dashed past the guard, shouting: \"Prisoner escaped!\r\nCame this way!\" The man gaped. The shouting behind me grew louder. I\r\nheard the thud of many feet, running. I flung open the door, slammed\r\nit shut behind me, and turned the key.\r\n\r\nA long row of giant electrode bulbs, as tall as a man, stretched\r\nbefore me--the source of the Zeta-ray. From here came the power that\r\nheld back the waters, that bored the tunnel. A thunderous knocking\r\nshook the door. Someone at a huge switchboard turned toward me.\r\nInstantly my hand was out of my pocket, and the ray-tube leveled at\r\nthe nearest bulb. I pressed the trigger. The bulb crashed. I swept\r\ndown the line. Crash, crash, crash--they were all gone.\r\n\r\nI whirled to meet the expected attack. It was wholly instinctive, for\r\nin a second we'd all be dead anyway. The waters would be down on us.\r\n\r\nBut the switchboard operator wasn't springing at me. Instead, he was\r\ntugging frantically, at a long lever that came down from above. There\r\nwas a clang, and a steel shutter dropped across the door.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen came a sound of crashing thunder that split my eardrums with its\r\nunbearable clamor. Then a mightier roar, as the mountain-high sea,\r\nheld back so long by the invisible ray, poured its countless millions\r\nof tons of deep green water down into the man-made hole.\r\n\r\nThe impact was terrific. The yards-thick concrete shuddered and\r\nstrained. The tremendous pressure forced trickles of water into the\r\nconcrete shell: the roaring of the elements was indescribably\r\ndeafening.\r\n\r\nI was in pitch darkness, expecting every moment to be crushed under\r\nmiles of ocean, when suddenly I was thrown from my feet. The floor was\r\nheaving drunkenly beneath me. In a moment I was slammed breathlessly\r\nagainst the shattered remnants of a huge vacuum tube. The jagged glass\r\nslashed my arms and face. I grabbed with my hand to steady myself;\r\ncame in contact with an iron bar: clung like grim death.\r\n\r\nFor a huge concrete sphere was whirling, tossing, gyrating in a welter\r\nof waters. The din was terrific. I rolled over and over, my arms\r\nalmost pulled out of their sockets. Then, like a ton of brick,\r\nsomething collided with my head. There was a blinding flare in the\r\nblack void, and I knew no more.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSlowly I came out of a hideous nightmare.\r\n\r\nMy head ached frightfully, and my wounds smarted and stung. It was\r\ndark, but a faint luminescence from somewhere enabled me to faintly\r\ndiscern my surroundings. I was wedged between a steel cable-bracket\r\nand the curving wall. Across the glass strewn floor a body lay,\r\nsprawling queerly.\r\n\r\nThe room was swaying in long undulations, or was it my head? I lay\r\nhelpless, unable to move. A leg dangled uselessly. There was a bump,\r\nthe sound of scraping. I heard confused sounds penetrating the walls,\r\nand the jar of steady impacts.\r\n\r\nA half an hour passed so; maybe an hour: I had no means of telling. I\r\nwas weak from pain and loss of blood, and slightly delirious.\r\n\r\nA faint whirring noise, a sudden intensity in the illumination caused\r\nme to turn my head. The steel shutter was glowing red, then a shower\r\nof white sparks broke through. The heavy steel was melting away into\r\nincandescence. It crashed.\r\n\r\nA group of men stumbled cautiously in. Now I was sure I was delirious.\r\nFor the men wore khaki uniforms! Americans! Then, in my fever, I\r\nthought I heard a familiar voice cry out my name. It was Jim's voice.\r\nA roaring curtain of blackness shut down on me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke again I was lying in a clean-sheeted hospital bed. Jim\r\nwas sitting at the side, staring at me with gloomy eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Jim,\" I gasped weakly. \"How did I get here?\"\r\n\r\nIt was touching to see the instantaneous delight on his weathered\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n\"So you came to at last, you old son-of-a-gun! Thought you were\r\ncashing in on us for a while. How did you get here? That's just what\r\nI want to know. How in hell _did_ you get here?\"\r\n\r\nI was still pretty weak. \"You pulled me out. What happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're still trying to puzzle it out. Wouldn't be surprised if you had\r\na hand in it, you blighter. We were watching that damned cloud,\r\nworrying ourselves to death. What with the _New York_ going out like a\r\nlight, and not hearing anything from you, we were pretty low.\r\n\r\n\"Then, suddenly, there was a tremendous detonation. The whole cloud\r\nmass collapsed like a pricked bubble, and a bottomless pit yawned\r\nunderneath the ocean--and, next thing we knew, our raft was yanked\r\nfrom under our feet, plunging and bucking in a swirl of waters.\r\n\r\n\"I just had time to grab hold of a stanchion, when we were sucked down\r\ninto a whirlpool such as I never hope to see again. Round and round we\r\nspun, the tumbling waters mountain high above us. I was buried most of\r\nthe time in crashing billows; my arms were almost pulled out of their\r\nsockets.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I never expected to see daylight again,\" Jim went on. \"My hold was\r\nbeing broken when at last we were spewed out somehow onto a sea that\r\nlooked as if a thousand hurricanes were blowing down.\r\n\r\n\"I managed to get my men together--what was left of them. There were\r\npitifully few. Later, I heard that our losses were enormous. Over\r\nseventy-five per cent of our rafts on a 50-mile front were lost, and\r\nthe enemies' were almost totally wiped out.\r\n\r\n\"When the mile-high seas had toned down a bit, we saw a huge concrete\r\nball tossing about like a cork. Couldn't make out what the devil it\r\nwas. Then someone noticed a door. We got that open, but there was a\r\nsteel one inside. We had to slice it with an oxy-hydrogen flame.\r\nInside, snug as a bug in a rug, were you.\r\n\r\n\"Now come on, tell me how in blazes you got in there. If you don't\r\nspill it quick, I'll bust.\"\r\n\r\nI sat up in my excitement. \"Don't you see, they were afraid the ray\r\nmight fail. They had those concrete balls stuck all around so that the\r\nofficers at least could escape, if it did. Their best technical men\r\nmust have been running the control room. They made sure to have that\r\nspecially strong. And the wave caused by the water pouring into the\r\nhole swept me right over here, just where I started from.\"\r\n\r\nJim had both hands on my shoulders, was pushing me down. \"Whoa, baby,\r\nwhoa. That's just as clear as a darkness-rayed area. Count up to ten,\r\nand start all over again.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Ten-_shun_!\"\r\n\r\nThe general himself strode into the room. And then I _had_ to tell my\r\nstory straight.\r\n\r\n\r\nA BEE'S BREATH\r\n\r\nThe breath of a bee, important because of its indication of the health\r\nof the insect in winter and of the efficiency of the sweet-producing\r\nhive in summer, was recently measured by Prof. G. H. Vansell of the\r\nUniversity of California. To do this he conducted the air coming from\r\nthe hive through a tube into bulbs containing absorbent chemicals.\r\nAllowing for the natural carbon dioxide and water of the outside air,\r\nhe weighed these bulbs, getting an analysis of the breath of the hive\r\nby the amount of water vapor and carbon dioxide the chemicals in the\r\nbulbs had picked up.\r\n\r\nHe found that in winter when the bees were inactive the average hourly\r\nwater loss from the entire hive was thirty six millionths of an ounce.\r\nIn summer when the insects were hard at work making honey and\r\ngathering nectar the water loss was twenty five times as great. The\r\ncarbon dioxide output, however, did not even double in summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Meeting Place for Readers of_ Astounding Stories\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Readers' Corner]\r\n\r\n\r\n_And That's That_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     May I have just a little room in \"The Readers' Corner\" to\r\n     answer Mr. Meek's argument and defend myself from the charge\r\n     of hasty reading? You will remember that I did not write my\r\n     letter immediately after the publication of the first\r\n     Heaviside Layer story, but waited until the appearance of\r\n     the second, a \"cooling-off\" period of three months. In that\r\n     time I re-read the story and considered it at length. I\r\n     don't call that hasty reading. Besides, the flaw in the\r\n     story is so obvious that even a \"hasty\" reading should\r\n     suffice to find it.\r\n\r\n     I can't argue about the matter of meteors because Mr. Meek\r\n     has not given any figures concerning the density or\r\n     viscosity of his medium. But I can say that to my way of\r\n     thinking any astronomer could detect the effect of such\r\n     friction on the action of meteors. They should certainly be\r\n     consumed much more rapidly than if they merely struck thin\r\n     air.\r\n\r\n     That, however, is a minor point and I wouldn't even mind\r\n     conceding it to Mr. Meek. The point I now wish to make is\r\n     much more important and in my mind establishes the falsity\r\n     of Mr. Meek's premises. In the July issue of Astounding\r\n     Stories, page seven, paragraph four, sentences fourteen and\r\n     fifteen, he states that the Heaviside Layer is composed of a\r\n     liquid of high viscosity. By definition a liquid is more\r\n     dense than a gas. Therefore the Heaviside Layer, according\r\n     to Mr. Meek, is denser than the atmosphere of the earth\r\n     since the former is a liquid and the latter is a gas. The\r\n     increased refraction of light as it entered our atmosphere\r\n     would then be noticeable. Astronomers can even now detect\r\n     refraction due to the air. The sun remains visible for some\r\n     time after it has actually descended below the horizon, due\r\n     to refraction. If there was a denser substance than air\r\n     surrounding the earth the refraction would be much greater.\r\n     Finally, how could the atmosphere support a denser substance\r\n     like the Heaviside Layer? I'd sure make for cover if I\r\n     really believed that such a menace existed right over my\r\n     head.\r\n\r\n     Sorry to take up your space so much by an argument, but your\r\n     comments on my letter really called for a defense. Hope you\r\n     can find room for this.--Philip Waite, 3400 Wayne Ave, New\r\n     Your, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     Since Mr. Waite has so generously admitted the validity of\r\n     my answer to his criticism as regards meteors, I can do no\r\n     less than admit that he scored one against me in his second\r\n     argument. I used the word liquid. It was careless diction.\r\n     Had I used the phrase \"composed of a SUBSTANCE of high\r\n     viscosity, of low specific gravity and with a coefficient of\r\n     refraction identical with that of air,\" there would have\r\n     been no argument. I am sure that Mr. Waite will admit after\r\n     reflection that such a substance could be held in position,\r\n     if its specific gravity were low enough, by a combination of\r\n     gravity and centrifugal force, somewhat in the same manner\r\n     as the ring of Saturn is held in place. Of course, any idea\r\n     that the layer rested on the air and was supported in place\r\n     by it, would be untenable. As I said in my previous letter,\r\n     I don't believe such a layer exists. If it does, I hope that\r\n     no one proves it before I get some characters off on a space\r\n     flyer for an interplanetary adventure or two.--S. P. Meek,\r\n     Capt., Ord. Dept., U. S. A.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Right from the Shoulder_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     I know for a fact that Astounding Stories is the best\r\n     Science Fiction magazine on the stands. I have read it every\r\n     issue except the first three, and have not yet found a bad\r\n     story. The characters in other Science Fiction magazines\r\n     seem like machines, but Astounding Stories' characters seem\r\n     like intimate friends. Why do ---- [censored] like some\r\n     write in and start bellyaching about the cover, pages, the\r\n     size, the edges and many other things that no one but ----\r\n     [censored] would notice? If they know so much why don't they\r\n     start a magazine and put all other publications out of\r\n     business? If they liked the stories they would not care if\r\n     the color of the cover was black or red, white and blue. I\r\n     get so interested in the stories that the edges of the paper\r\n     do not amount to anything; and people that bellyache about\r\n     such minor things prove that they do not care for the\r\n     stories, and furthermore they prove that they are ----\r\n     [censored] and ---- [censored] ready for the booby hatch.\r\n\r\n     There is only one thing wrong with the perfect magazine: it\r\n     does not come out twice a month. I have never known a bunch\r\n     of Editors that have the intelligence of the Staff of\r\n     Astounding Stories [uncensored--Ed.]. They have never\r\n     published a single story that any intelligent Reader could\r\n     kick about.\r\n\r\n     About reprints: whether the Editors think that they should\r\n     publish some or not, it is all the same to me, as they know\r\n     what they are doing. I should like very much to see some\r\n     stories by Burroughs, though.\r\n\r\n     If I were to name your best authors, I would have to name\r\n     every one that ever wrote a story for your wonderful\r\n     magazine.--H. N. Sager, R. F. D. 6, Box 419, Bessemer, Ala.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Disposing of Old Stories_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     I have observed that numerous readers request reprints. I\r\n     have a collection that goes back to 1900! Since I have no\r\n     more use for them, I have decided to dispense with them.\r\n     Here is an infinitesimal list:\r\n\r\n     A. Merritt: \"Thru the Dragon Glass,\" \"The Moon Pool,\" \"The\r\n     Metal Monster\" and \"The Ship of Ishtar.\"\r\n\r\n     Homer Eon Flint: \"Out of the Moon,\" \"The Planeteer,\" \"The\r\n     King of Conserve Island,\" \"The Blind Spot\" and \"Flint and\r\n     Hall.\"\r\n\r\n     Jules Black: \"Beyond the Earth Atom\" and \"Marooned in\r\n     Space.\"\r\n\r\n     John Louis Hill: \"The Dimension Wizard\" and \"The Challenge\r\n     from Beyond.\"\r\n\r\n     Davidson Mortimer: \"Lost in Time\" and \"The Amazing Empire\r\n     Lost in Time\" (sequel to story previously mentioned).\r\n\r\n     Booth Langell: \"The Moons of Lanisar.\"\r\n\r\n     As I said before, this is but a small part of the Science\r\n     Fiction stories I have. Anyone desiring stories mentioned\r\n     above, or any others, please write to me.--George Zambock,\r\n     459 E. 155th St., New York, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Kind Offer_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     I'm sure you will sympathize with me for reading your\r\n     magazine in study hall.\r\n\r\n     It is so very dull--I have three S.H.'s in a row--that I\r\n     have to do something to relieve the monotony, so, seeing the\r\n     latest copy of A. S. at my newsdealer's, I brought it back\r\n     to school after dinner. I am speaking of the February\r\n     number. I very much enjoyed the Dr. Bird story. Capt. Meek\r\n     is always good. \"Phalanxes of Atlans\" promises to be an\r\n     excellent story, also.\r\n\r\n     What I want to know is, why are so many mossbacks throwing\r\n     brickbats? What does it matter if some of the stories are\r\n     not on the scientific chalk line? A very wise man once said\r\n     that \"Variety is the spice of life,\" so why not take a hint,\r\n     some of you would-be brickbat pitchers, and pipe down?\r\n\r\n     I have read every issue of Astounding Stories published so\r\n     far, and have not a brickbat to report as yet. I notice in\r\n     one letter to \"The Readers' Corner\" a request for a\r\n     department on rocket propulsion. I presume the writer meant\r\n     on propelling rocket planes. I have experimented on rocket\r\n     ships for the past three years and can give some data on\r\n     these as to the construction of models (for when I say ships\r\n     I really mean model airplanes). I have had this as my hobby\r\n     for the past four and a half years, and can give extensive\r\n     information on model building. I specialize in models\r\n     powered by power other than rubber; and I took second place\r\n     at the Atlantic City Tournament held in October by the\r\n     National Play-ground Association, in the Annual National\r\n     Championships.\r\n\r\n     Anyone desiring information on the rocket ship or any other\r\n     type of model plane will be promptly answered by addressing\r\n     their letter to me.\r\n\r\n     I hope you will find room to publish this, as I like nothing\r\n     better than helping someone get started on my favorite\r\n     hobby, aviation. I have, however, several hobbies, including\r\n     football, basket-ball, tennis, swimming, boating and hiking.\r\n     I live within ten miles of the Great Smoky Mountains\r\n     National Park, and can see from the study hall window, which\r\n     I now am seated near to, three ranges of the mountains all\r\n     covered with more than ten inches of snow.--Richard M.\r\n     Evans, Box 305, Maryville, Tenn.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Defense_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     Some of the letters you have printed in \"The Readers'\r\n     Corner\" almost burn me up. Edwin C. Magnuson asks you what\r\n     you print there: only letters praising your magazine to the\r\n     skies? or occasional brickbats? Well, I might say one thing,\r\n     and that is: if you did print all brickbats, as he seems to\r\n     want you to, the Readers would think that your magazine\r\n     wasn't of much account if that was the kind of letters you\r\n     got all the time, and would probably quit reading it.\r\n\r\n     He also said he felt like quitting several times because the\r\n     stories weren't scientific. Well, if he can show me anywhere\r\n     on your magazine where it says it is a scientific magazine,\r\n     I'll certainly beg his most humble pardon on bended knee. He\r\n     also crabbed about your artists. If he can do better, I\r\n     advise you to hire him. He also says that the paper is\r\n     rotten, and that after a few handlings goes to pieces. I\r\n     still have all my magazines, and have lent them several\r\n     times, and the paper is still there. On his fifth statement\r\n     I agree with him: you should have an editorial. Also I would\r\n     certainly like to have reprints, as there are about six\r\n     issues I didn't get, and I imagine there are several other\r\n     Readers in the same boat.\r\n\r\n     Hume V. Stephani makes a very good suggestion about a\r\n     quarterly. I certainly think it would be appreciated and\r\n     would go over big. And Robert J. Hyatt, I most certainly\r\n     agree with you in your letter printed in the February issue;\r\n     and if this letter is printed (which I hope it is) I hope\r\n     you will see it, and know that at least one person has the\r\n     same views on the magazine that you do.--Buel Godwin,\r\n     101--3rd Avenue, S. E. Le Mars, Iowa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Now a Real Pest_\"\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     I have recently been initiated into the reading of Science\r\n     Fiction, and as a result I am now a real pest to the\r\n     magazine vendor, from asking for the next copy of Astounding\r\n     Stories. I have just finished your February copy and words\r\n     can't express my enjoyment.\r\n\r\n     \"The Tentacles from Below\" is indeed a Science Fiction\r\n     masterpiece. I devour eagerly Captain S. P. Meek's stories\r\n     about Dr. Bird. As long as you keep Meek you can be assured\r\n     that I will purchase this magazine. \"The Pirate Planet\"\r\n     proved to be a story worthy to be kept as a reprint for\r\n     future issues. In fact, many of your stories are so good\r\n     that it is a shame that others can't enjoy them in future\r\n     issues of Astounding Stories.\r\n\r\n     Wesso is a great artist and I appreciate to the fullest\r\n     extent his remarkable pictures.\r\n\r\n     Yours for a continuation of your present success in editing\r\n     and publishing remarkable stories--Lester P. Lieber, 542\r\n     Dalzell St., Shreveport, La.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stands Pat_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     Although this is my first letter to \"The Readers' Corner\" of\r\n     your publication, I have nevertheless been a consistent\r\n     Reader of the magazine since its inception. Contrary to many\r\n     of your correspondents I have nothing to say against your\r\n     magazine or policy. I like its size, its artists and most of\r\n     its stories. I shall not bother to name those I do not like\r\n     because I do not believe that there is a magazine to be\r\n     found that can publish stories to suit all its Readers.\r\n\r\n     I enjoy the serials and your two-part novelettes since it\r\n     gives one something to look forward to each month. I enjoyed\r\n     \"The Pirate Planet\" by Charles W. Diffin so much I was sorry\r\n     to see it end, and I hope there will be more of his work in\r\n     the future. I am particularly glad to see such writers as\r\n     Captain S. P. Meek, Ray Cummings, Miles J. Breuer, Victor\r\n     Rousseau and Harl Vincent as regular contributors to your\r\n     pages, but there are also a number of other writers whom I\r\n     miss seeing in \"our\" mag. Of these are A. Hyatt-Verrill who\r\n     writes so well of the Incas, Otis Adelbert Kline who also\r\n     gives us excellent stories and Leslie F. Stone whose \"Men\r\n     with Wings\" and \"Women with Wings\" appeared in another\r\n     magazine and which I enjoyed exceedingly. I believe that to\r\n     have these writers as regular contributors would add much to\r\n     the interest of the publication.\r\n\r\n     With the compliments of an avid reader of Science Fiction. I\r\n     salute you.--Theodore Morris, 1412 S. W. 13th St., Miami,\r\n     Fla.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Under My Collar_\"\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     I have been reading Astounding Stories for a good while and\r\n     I like it fine. I noticed in your last issue that a fellow\r\n     by the name of Edwin C. Magnuson was kicking about \"The\r\n     Readers' Corner.\" Some of his reasons, I think, for not\r\n     liking this magazine are as follows: first, the\r\n     illustrations are poor. I believe they are good. Second, he\r\n     says that he doesn't like stories such as those written by\r\n     Charles W. Diffin, Jackson Gee, Murray Leinster and Victor\r\n     Rousseau. He also has in his letter a list of authors whose\r\n     works he likes. I do not think they are so hot, with the\r\n     exception of Capt. S. P. Meek. Mr. Magnuson also says he is\r\n     disgusted with Astounding Stories and would like to quit\r\n     reading it. Well, why doesn't he?\r\n\r\n     I want to say it is a fine mag. I don't like to be a critic,\r\n     but that fellow got under my collar. The only thing that\r\n     could be done is to publish at least twice a month.\r\n\r\n     Well, reckon I will sign off. Here is to Astounding Stories.\r\n     A better mag can't be found!--Boyd H. Goodman, 2008 McKinney\r\n     Ave., Dallas, Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From Franklin to Poe_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     As a Reader of Astounding Stories from the first number I\r\n     would like to comment on your magazine regarding your\r\n     stories and the subject of reprints.\r\n\r\n     First, you are publishing one of the best Science Fiction\r\n     magazines on the market, and I read three of them. And\r\n     although I agree with Mr. Magnuson and others on the subject\r\n     of reprints, I do not agree with the former that the paper\r\n     is rotten and falls to pieces. I have a complete file of\r\n     Astounding Stories to date and I have not noticed any signs\r\n     of disintegration amongst them as yet.\r\n\r\n     You could easily follow the suggestion of Mr. Stephani, and\r\n     have a space for good reprints and charge a nickel more. I\r\n     believe most of your Readers would approve of it.\r\n\r\n     The story, \"The Sunken Empire,\" was fine, and it is to the\r\n     credit of Science Fiction that in addition to interesting\r\n     Readers in other worlds it has also created an interest in\r\n     the fate of lands from which the Atlantic Ocean received its\r\n     name. This story is reminiscent of a story which appeared in\r\n     The Saturday Evening Post about three years ago called\r\n     \"Maracot Deep.\" In this story a party of men (three, I\r\n     believe) descended to the bottom of the Atlantic and found a\r\n     surviving colony from Atlantis, and saw reproduced on a\r\n     screen events leading up to the sinking of Atlantis. It was\r\n     written by the late Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and the only\r\n     weak spot was that Sir Arthur had to change the submergence\r\n     of Atlantis from a natural catastrophe into a \"judgment\" of\r\n     the gods, whose sense of propriety was outraged by the\r\n     \"wickedness\" of the Atlanteans. If you reprinted this story\r\n     your Readers would eat it up.\r\n\r\n     I hope that you publish this letter because I want to reply\r\n     through your \"Readers' Corner\" to Mr. Richard Lewis of\r\n     Knoxville, Iowa, on the subject of reprints.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Lewis says he has read most of the classic scientific\r\n     stories referred to. Well, so have I, but I should like to\r\n     read many of them again as would many of your Readers. I\r\n     have for the last twenty years been reading literary\r\n     classics but when I receive my copies of Good Literature or\r\n     The Golden Book I do not consider myself cheated because I\r\n     find some stories in them that I have read before. The best\r\n     are always worth reading at least twice.\r\n\r\n     As an illustration, has Mr. Lewis ever read the following:\r\n     the \"Kasidah,\" by Sir Richard Burton, who gave the world its\r\n     best literal translation of \"The Arabian Nights,\" which\r\n     differs as daylight from dark in comparison with the Lane\r\n     and Payne translations which are only edited for children to\r\n     read? Or has he read the chapter which Benjamin Franklin\r\n     added to the Bible? If Mr. Lewis read these for the first\r\n     time in any magazine he takes he would no doubt consider\r\n     them well worth the price of the magazine or more, yet they\r\n     would be reprints, the last one about as old as the United\r\n     States.\r\n\r\n     The \"Kasidah\" is a long poem on philosophic aspects of\r\n     evolution in which almost all Science Fiction Readers are\r\n     interested. In contains lines like the following:\r\n\r\n          \"Conscience was bred\r\n           When man had shed\r\n           His fur, his tail\r\n           And pointed ears.\"\r\n\r\n     And as a dissertation on our caveman ancestors:\r\n\r\n          \"They fought for women as for food.\r\n           When 'Mays' awoke to warm desire;\r\n           And this the lust that changed to love\r\n           When fancy lent a purer fire.\"\r\n\r\n     Regarding the Franklin chapter, it is stated that \"Wise Old\r\n     Ben\" used to insert it between the pages of the Bible and\r\n     read it to his friends in the City of Brotherly Love, and\r\n     great was the consternation of many who thought they knew\r\n     the Scriptures from \"cover to cover.\"\r\n\r\n     Any new readers of Science Fiction would be glad to read\r\n     \"The Girl in the Golden Atom,\" \"The Fire People\" and \"The\r\n     Man Who Mastered Time,\" by Ray Cummings. I like to read this\r\n     author's work, but I believe when he wrote this trilogy of\r\n     Matter, Space and Time that he reached the heights of his\r\n     writing. I have never read any subsequent writings of his\r\n     that I thought exceeded them.\r\n\r\n     Speaking of the necessity of authors eating, Mr. Lewis\r\n     states that good stories have never been written on an empty\r\n     stomach.\r\n\r\n     Edgar Allan Poe who wrote \"Shades\" was one of the most\r\n     brilliant of American writers, and his stomach was empty\r\n     most of the time. And when this master of ratiocination had\r\n     on rare occasions a full stomach it was invariably full of\r\n     \"hooch.\"\r\n\r\n     As Mr. Lewis speaks as a pedagogue, is it not a\r\n     physiological fact that an empty stomach clears the mind by\r\n     diverting the blood stream from the necessity of digesting\r\n     food? And while I am not advocating any fast cures for\r\n     authors, some of them (although few in Astounding Stories)\r\n     would be greatly benefited by trying it.\r\n\r\n     In conclusion I should like to say to Mr. Lewis and others\r\n     who take the same slant on reprints, that there are many of\r\n     the finest writings in Science Fiction and the classics\r\n     which you and I have never even heard of, much less read.\r\n\r\n     I will close with best wishes for your continued\r\n     success--Joseph R. Barnes, Cache Junction, Utah.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Now Feeling Better_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     Well, I guess I've just about gotten you exasperated with\r\n     all the brickbats I've been cannoning into your office.\r\n     However, I believe this letter will make you feel a little\r\n     better.\r\n\r\n     The latest issue was fine. There wasn't a story in it that I\r\n     didn't enjoy. \"The Tentacles from Below\" was a surprisingly\r\n     good story, especially when you consider that I don't like\r\n     sea stories. I liked this one very much.\r\n\r\n     Another extremely great surprise was \"Werewolves of War.\"\r\n     From the few notes about it I surmised that it was another\r\n     one of those hero-dying-and-saving-his-country stories; and\r\n     it was--but not the kind I expected it to be. The author's\r\n     narrative and descriptive abilities were such that I forgot\r\n     all about the plot running throughout the story. Hang on to\r\n     that fellow.\r\n\r\n     The other complete story was also good. The conclusion of\r\n     the \"The Pirate Planet\" was also good, as were its preceding\r\n     instalments. The first instalment of \"Phalanxes of Atlans\"\r\n     was unusual. That's gonna turn out to be one of the best\r\n     stories you've yet published, or I miss my bet.--G.\r\n     Kirschner, Box 301, Temple, Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Paper Is Durable_\"\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     While reading \"The Readers' Corner\" in your January issue I\r\n     noticed a bit of criticism by Edwin Magnuson of Duluth,\r\n     Minn. In it he said that you have printed some stories\r\n     containing little or no science. But, first, most of your\r\n     Readers like a little change in a subject and I advise one\r\n     or two of these about two or three months apart. Second, the\r\n     paper is of durable material, for I pass my magazine to my\r\n     friends who read it and then return it with very few pages\r\n     torn. Third, I agree that reprints would be a blessing, for\r\n     most of your readers have not read stories by Cummings,\r\n     Breuer, Wells and Vincent. Fourth, the fact that some\r\n     stories have not a sound scientific basis is quite all right\r\n     because every fair reader likes his stories fired with some\r\n     imagination.--Walter Witte, 960 Duchess St., St. Paul,\r\n     Minn.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Suggestions_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     Although I have read every issue of A. S. since it came out,\r\n     I have never written about it, and this is what I have to\r\n     say:\r\n\r\n     First, it is just as good or better than two other Science\r\n     Fiction magazines that I can name.\r\n\r\n     Second, in my opinion you have some of the best modern\r\n     authors, such as Cummings, Meek, Rousseau, Diffin, Vincent\r\n     and Hamilton. Also others.\r\n\r\n     The stories have been A-1 with the exception of \"Murder\r\n     Madness,\" which, in my opinion, does not belong in a\r\n     magazine of this type, but in a detective story magazine,\r\n     because that is all it was--a detective story. And when are\r\n     you going to have a sequel to \"The Gray Plague,\" by L. A.\r\n     Eshbach which appeared in the November issue? It deserves\r\n     one.\r\n\r\n     The best author on your staff is Captain S. P. Meek, whose\r\n     Dr. Bird stories cannot be equalled. They are science\r\n     stories plus.\r\n\r\n     A few suggestions: an occasional reprint. It would not\r\n     affect the living conditions of our present day authors and\r\n     would give us all a chance to read a classic of yesterday.\r\n\r\n     Do not change the size (i. e. width and length); but as for\r\n     enlarging it in the thickness direction, you have my\r\n     heartiest encouragement. I notice that one of the other\r\n     magazines has changed its size, so now you are not alone.\r\n     Evening up the edges of the sheets would improve the looks,\r\n     however. And now that you have had your first birthday, when\r\n     are you going to start a quarterly? In it you could publish\r\n     a complete book length novel and seven novelettes. By novel,\r\n     I mean a story of about one hundred pages or more of your\r\n     present size, and novelettes fifty pages or more. You could\r\n     double the price because a quarterly is worth double what a\r\n     monthly is worth.\r\n\r\n     Your artists are great, but you could still improve by\r\n     having them make a full page illustration at the start and\r\n     one more exciting one as the story progresses.\r\n\r\n     Well, I think I've said enough good things about you and\r\n     enough suggestions, so until January 1932, adios, au revoir,\r\n     etc.--Henry Benner, Cowithe, Wash.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ouch!_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     Personally I would rather read a good short story than the\r\n     ten pages of instructions by Readers published in the March\r\n     issue. Two pages are plenty, especially when half the\r\n     criticisms concern paper, size, edges of paper, etc. A. S.\r\n     is O. K!\r\n\r\n     How about that other short?--Don Ward, 6 Ketchel St.,\r\n     Auburn, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Likes Action_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     I have just finished the February issue of Astounding\r\n     Stories. All of the stories were so good I couldn't tell you\r\n     which one is the best. \"The Phalanxes of Atlans\" and \"The\r\n     Tentacles from Below\" were very good. I liked \"The Black\r\n     Lamp,\" too. It is up to the standard of the rest of the Dr.\r\n     Bird stories. \"The Pirate Planet\" ended very beautifully.\r\n     However, I did not like that about Sykes getting killed.\r\n     \"Werewolves of War\" was good. It ended differently from most\r\n     of the other stories. Most of them end with the hero\r\n     escaping, but in this the hero was killed. It had a very\r\n     good plot.\r\n\r\n     I got my first copy of Astounding Stories last July and I\r\n     haven't missed a copy since. Why not put out Astounding\r\n     Stories twice a month, or make it a weekly? I hate to have\r\n     to wait a whole month before I get another copy.\r\n\r\n     I believe that the best story I have ever read in this\r\n     magazine was \"The Invisible Death,\" by Victor Rousseau.\r\n\r\n     The reason I like Astounding Stories better than any other\r\n     Science Fiction magazine is that most of the other magazines\r\n     have too much science and not enough action.--Dale Griffith,\r\n     437 Carson St., San Antonio, Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_To Satisfy Myself_\"\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     It has been long since I read the February issue of your\r\n     magazine and I'm waiting anxiously for the March issue.\r\n\r\n     The February issue had some very good stories, and I just\r\n     must say that the story entitled \"Werewolves of War,\" is the\r\n     best story of its type I have ever read. Unlike most of\r\n     these stories there is more future truth than fiction.\r\n\r\n     Perhaps you didn't expect to hear from me so soon again, but\r\n     I am interested in this type of story as I used to write\r\n     this kind in my English class back in high school. My\r\n     stories were of this type, but always different from any\r\n     that the rest of the class wrote. Another thing, I love to\r\n     be writing, so I take this way to satisfy myself. I do hope\r\n     you will excuse me.\r\n\r\n     I have one more thing to say and that is: I only wish your\r\n     magazine was put out every two weeks instead of every four;\r\n     or print more stories and raise the price to twenty five\r\n     cents. I'm sure people will pay if they are as interested as\r\n     I.--Ken F. Haley, 36 Mechanic St., Lebanon, N.H.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Easier to Turn_\"\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     I have just read \"The Readers' Corner\" of the March issue\r\n     and noticed that bright remark about that super-rotten\r\n     story, \"Skylark Three.\" Anyone who liked that story is\r\n     certainly not hard to please. It does not compare with the\r\n     worst story ever published. I also read that \"other\r\n     magazine\" and I say that it has disgraced itself by \"Skylark\r\n     Three.\"\r\n\r\n     Everything is perfect about your magazine except that there\r\n     are not enough stories in each issue. The uneven edges are\r\n     just fine, for it makes the pages easier to turn. The covers\r\n     are not too gaudy. The covers should depict a thrilling\r\n     incident in a story; they do.\r\n\r\n     \"Phalanxes of Atlans\" offered a good theory as to the\r\n     whereabouts of the descendants of the Atlanteans and the\r\n     Lost Tribes of Israel. It was keen.\r\n\r\n     I conclude my letter with a warning: do not change your\r\n     type. Also do not change your order of issue; I mean, do not\r\n     make your magazine into a bi-monthly as I see some magazines\r\n     of this type have done.--Robert Leonard Russell, 825 Casey\r\n     Ave., Mt. Vernon, Illinois.\r\n\r\n\r\n_You Tell 'Em!_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     I have always considered the drawings of H. W. Wesso far\r\n     superior to those of all other Science Fiction artists, and,\r\n     indeed, much better than the work of most pulp magazine\r\n     illustrators. But his cover for the March issue of\r\n     Astounding Stories was remarkable even for him; it was a\r\n     veritable masterpiece.\r\n\r\n     So enthralled was I by the first sight of this eye-arresting\r\n     picture that I stared at it for minutes on end. This\r\n     snarling titan with his mighty arm outstretched toward the\r\n     tiny figures just beyond his reach--what a gripping tableau!\r\n\r\n     Free from the superfluous, uninteresting machinery and\r\n     apparatus that clutter up most illustrations in other\r\n     Science Fiction magazines, your March cover remained\r\n     fantastic, but human--a picture that expressed the very\r\n     essence of super-scientific fiction as presented in\r\n     Astounding Stories. Vivid in color, striking in subject,\r\n     dramatic in treatment and drawn with consummate skill, that\r\n     cover must have attracted many new Readers to this magazine.\r\n\r\n     And the promise held out by the cover was more than\r\n     fulfilled by the contents of that issue--one of your best to\r\n     date. The only discordant note in the entire magazine was\r\n     the yapping and ranting of certain dissatisfied ----\r\n     [censored] too ---- [censored] to appreciate the finest,\r\n     most worthy publication in its field to-day.--Booth Cody,\r\n     Bronx, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Nothing Is Automatic_\"\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     First, I wish to congratulate you on the increasing quality\r\n     of your magazine since its first issue. It surpasses all\r\n     other Science Fiction magazines, and I haven't missed a\r\n     single issue and don't intend to!\r\n\r\n     What prompted me to write this letter was an article, \"A\r\n     Robot Chemist,\" published in your March, 1931, issue. In the\r\n     article it states that a mechanical robot performed several\r\n     experiments without human supervision. But, I am sorry to\r\n     say, I disagree. Nothing is automatic. Foolishly, after\r\n     perfecting anything that performs its work afterwards by\r\n     itself, man calls it an automaton. But it is not! Did he not\r\n     have to work and slave hour after hour, day after day and\r\n     month after month to perfect it? He did! Ever since man\r\n     became civilized he has deceived himself by calling, for\r\n     instance, machinery in a factory, automatons. The quest for\r\n     automatic machinery is as hopeless as the quest for\r\n     perpetual motion!\r\n\r\n     What is my idea of an automaton? Well, take a robot for\r\n     instance. Man calls it an automaton in spite of the fact\r\n     that he had to slave to put it together before it did its\r\n     work.\r\n\r\n     My idea is this: the iron ore would come out itself, smelt\r\n     itself, form itself in the various shapes and parts needed\r\n     to construct a robot, then take its correct place and rivet\r\n     itself. Then the radio brain, electrical eyes and magnet\r\n     hands take their place; and when it has constructed itself\r\n     it will conduct the experiments--if a chemical\r\n     robot--without human supervision. Thus, the latter clause\r\n     would be true! That's my conception of an automatic robot!\r\n     Otherwise, its just some metal doing the bidding of a\r\n     master's brain.\r\n\r\n     Another thing: the novelette \"Beyond the Vanishing Point,\"\r\n     by Ray Cummings, is preposterous. The flesh might shrink or\r\n     grow, but the bone would not! If one shrunk as did George\r\n     Randolph, one's bones would burst through the flesh.\r\n\r\n     But in spite of all that, I like the stories that way.\r\n     Science, in the years to come might discover how to shrink\r\n     or grow both flesh and bones. I guess I'm taking too much of\r\n     your time, so adios!--Jay Zee, Chicago, Illinois.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hot Times in the Fire-House_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     The first Thursday in each month I make a bee-line for the\r\n     newsstand--and Astounding Stories. It may interest you to\r\n     know that I have every issue on file that you have put out.\r\n\r\n     There have been some mighty good yarns in those issues, but\r\n     the one just at hand contains the best story you have ever\r\n     published--\"Terrors Unseen,\" by Harl Vincent. There's an\r\n     author for you; but evidently I don't have to tell you so,\r\n     as you have given us quite a number of his splendid stories.\r\n     \"Vagabonds of Space\" was a wow. Like some of the others who\r\n     have written in, I would like to see a sequel to this. Harl\r\n     Vincent is my favorite of all your authors.\r\n\r\n     A close second is Charles W. Diffin. He is good, too. As\r\n     your authors appeal to me, in order, I mean. I would line\r\n     them up in this way: Harl Vincent, Charles W. Diffin, R. F.\r\n     Starzl, Ray Cummings, Capt. S. P. Meek, Jack Williamson and\r\n     Murray Leinster.\r\n\r\n     I agree with Jim Nicholson of San Francisco that you should\r\n     give us some stories by Francis Flagg. Here is an author you\r\n     never have published, and, to my way of looking at things,\r\n     he has more fresh material than most of the authors put\r\n     together. Many of the things that have been copied widely\r\n     and used extensively (I don't mean that whole stories have\r\n     been stolen, or anything like that) were originated by this\r\n     fine writer. By all means get Francis Flagg. [We have just\r\n     bought a story--a good one--from him!--Ed]. He would stand\r\n     about third in my list if you had used his work before. I\r\n     made it up from those whose work has been used.\r\n\r\n     Two or three things I notice, that I would have you correct.\r\n     All your stories seem to be of standardized length, either\r\n     around 10,000 words or 25,000 words. Eliminate all\r\n     restrictions as to word length but make your writers boil\r\n     down their work. Most stories are too long, and could be\r\n     told better if cut down quite a bit. The paper and the page\r\n     size of the magazine are okay, but why not smooth edges? And\r\n     it is hard to keep the covers on. I wouldn't object to more\r\n     pages or an extra nickel in price. Or if not that, how about\r\n     publishing \"our\" magazine twice a month?\r\n\r\n     After fighting a fire, there's nothing like Astounding\r\n     Stories with which to \"unlax.\" You're doing a fine job, and\r\n     I only make these suggestions because I want a \"perfect\"\r\n     magazine instead of one that bats 97% all the time. Hope\r\n     you'll have room for all this. And, oh yes, keep on with\r\n     your program of \"No reprints.\" Your new yarns are better\r\n     than the old ones. Let's have the new ones, and encourage\r\n     our fine string of authors to do even better work.--Gayl\r\n     Whitman, Fireman, Co. No. 11, Main at 22nd, Columbus, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Correspondents Wanted_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     Another critic is going to take his pen in hand and give you\r\n     a bouquet. I have just finished reading the March issue of\r\n     A. S. and think it was fine.\r\n\r\n     Of all the stories you have published I liked \"The Gray\r\n     Plague\" the best. I don't care much for reprints because I\r\n     like new stories the best.\r\n\r\n     I would like to correspond with some of the Readers of A. S.\r\n     I will answer any or all letters I receive.--L. B. Knutson,\r\n     629--3rd Ave., So, Minneapolis, Minn.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Heroine a la Mode_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     I'm with J. H. Nicholson, who advises those who are\r\n     indifferent to the scientifically possible in order to give\r\n     the author a broader field in which to lay his plot. As he\r\n     says, they should feel right at home with their noses stuck\r\n     into a volume of Anderson's Fairy Tales. However, this\r\n     letter is more to express the science lovers' viewpoint than\r\n     to sling mud at the authors. For us, the plot loses much of\r\n     its kick if the science is not reasonable.\r\n\r\n     Suppose for once that one of these Readers who waives\r\n     scientific possibility aside as secondary should pick up a\r\n     plot-distorted story in which the heroine should be\r\n     described something as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Hers was a tall superbly built figure combining the\r\n     strength of a horse with the gentle curves of a hippo. When\r\n     she spoke, her sweetly modulated voice was as pleasant to\r\n     the ear as the bray of a Spanish jackass. Her hair hung to\r\n     her waist and was the convenient nesting place for several\r\n     English sparrows. She was slightly cockeyed from birth and\r\n     had had her nose squashed in a saloon brawl. She carried\r\n     herself with the graceful dignity of an African orang-utan\r\n     and was always much sought after, having a quaint habit of\r\n     slapping every new male she met a resounding whack on the\r\n     back that loosened their bridge work. Being a veteran\r\n     tobacco chewer and having high blood pressure she could spit\r\n     one hundred feet against a fifty-mile wind. When she ate in\r\n     company, she had an amusing way of gargling her soup in\r\n     G-flat. Her--\"\r\n\r\n     It's unnecessary to go further. Such a character would be\r\n     every bit as reasonably possible as some of the science\r\n     these science-conniving Readers are willing to sanction.\r\n\r\n     Here are some of the seemingly impossible feats of a recent\r\n     story: 1--a diver in an ordinary diving dress is able to\r\n     stand the pressure at three miles down; 2--(granting the\r\n     above is possible) a diver shoots up three miles without\r\n     stopping and still does not become a victim of the bends;\r\n     3--(granting the above two possible) a diver after shooting\r\n     from such a great depth and pressure to a depth of\r\n     comparatively low pressure would not be able to lower the\r\n     pressure inside his dress, since it would be held so rigid\r\n     that he would not be able to bend his arms; 4--a man or\r\n     animal suddenly released from the enormous pressure of about\r\n     three hundred tons to the square inch to atmospheric\r\n     pressure, it seems, would most certainly burst before the\r\n     internal pressure could equalize itself.\r\n\r\n     Please notice that I said seemingly wrong. I'm for A. S.\r\n     just one hundred per cent and would prefer to have it as\r\n     right as possible. I don't like crank letter writing and\r\n     would never have written this now if it hadn't been for\r\n     several of the letters in the March issue that gave me a\r\n     touch of hades under the collar. S'long. Maybe I'll write\r\n     again sometime when I get some more \"ham science\"\r\n     ideas.--William S. Lotsch, 1 Morrison Ave., Troy, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n_You Make Them Adequate_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     Thanks. Of course I accept your invitation to \"The Readers'\r\n     Corner.\" I have been a constant Reader of your magazine\r\n     since its appearance on the Science Fiction horizon, and I\r\n     have yet to meet a story that I failed to read in its\r\n     entirety or that I didn't like.\r\n\r\n     To merely write a letter and say that this story was good,\r\n     the other story was fair, and oh my! how poor the third\r\n     story was, is futile. But as it is the usual custom to do so\r\n     here goes:\r\n\r\n     Excellent stories--all of the first five volumes; good\r\n     stories--who's interested?; poor stories--where are they?;\r\n     good authors--takes up too much room and time; poor\r\n     authors--got tired looking for them.\r\n\r\n     All I want to say is, Astounding Stories is the best or one\r\n     of the best magazines on the market. Gee, but aren't words\r\n     futile when you describe something great and\r\n     wonderful!--Herbert Goodket, 707 Jackson Avenue, New York,\r\n     N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ain't It Too Awful!_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     I knew it. It was bound to come. At last my efforts have\r\n     been rewarded. Fame has sought me out--even in Brooklyn. It\r\n     was suggested in the March issue of Astounding Stories that\r\n     I, Louis Wentzler, as one of the active contributors to \"The\r\n     Readers' Corner,\" regale your Readers with a description of\r\n     myself, my interest in Science Fiction and how I got that\r\n     way. A picture was also requested, but this had better be\r\n     omitted. As for my personal history, bend an ear:\r\n\r\n     At the tender age of four, while making mud pies on the\r\n     doorstep of my home, I was beaned by a brick hurled by an\r\n     uncouth ruffian across the street. The results were not\r\n     fatal--who said \"unfortunately?\"--but from that moment I\r\n     developed a taste for Science Fiction. Had it not been for\r\n     that incident I might have grown up a normal lad; but the\r\n     caress of that brick on my cranium did things to me, and I\r\n     have been a Science Fiction addict since.\r\n\r\n     Of course, I do not contend that all Science Fiction fans\r\n     were hit by bricks, though a lot of them should be. I do\r\n     believe, however, that a slight concussion of the brain\r\n     helps one appreciate Science Fiction the more. Anyway, once\r\n     imbued with the urge I took to Science Fiction like a Hindu\r\n     to hashish. Such stories were rare in those days, but I\r\n     started to collect all I could find.\r\n\r\n     Then came the war. I was too young to fight, but I did my\r\n     bit making canteens out of old sieves. That was how my mind\r\n     worked, you see. Well, the war ended--I forgot who won--and\r\n     I went back to my beloved Science Fiction. Years have passed\r\n     since then, and I have a fine collection of stories now.\r\n     Should any of you care to see them, come around to the local\r\n     booby-hatch some time: you'll find me in Padded Cell No.\r\n     17.--Louis Wentzler, 1935 Woodbine St., Brooklyn, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hurrah!_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     Except for a brief letter of criticism in the August, 1930,\r\n     number of Astounding Stories, I have been a silent but loyal\r\n     follower of the magazine since its first issue. My silence\r\n     was that of profound satisfaction. Almost all the stories\r\n     suited me to perfection; and the few I did not like were\r\n     hardly worth commenting on. Since the magazine has grown\r\n     better with every issue I would probably have kept my peace;\r\n     but there is one disturbing factor which impels me to write\r\n     again.\r\n\r\n     I refer to the irresponsible outbursts of certain ----\r\n     [censored] who squeeze into \"The Readers' Corner\" and\r\n     sputter out senseless denunciations of the magazine, its\r\n     appearance, its policies, and so on. I do not object to\r\n     logical, well-founded criticism, but I most decidedly do\r\n     object to the ---- [censored] remarks and invidious\r\n     comparisons indulged in by various ---- [censored] Readers.\r\n     It's about time someone told them where to head in, and, by\r\n     your leave, I'll do it.\r\n\r\n     The most recent offender is J. Vernon Shea, Jr., a\r\n     Pittsburgh lad of eighteen who, in the March issue, ventures\r\n     to criticize the grammar of Ray Cummings, call the Editor\r\n     harsh names, and demand that the magazine conform to his own\r\n     dizzy notions. He concedes that Astounding Stories prints\r\n     consistently interesting tales, but charges that the Editor\r\n     is indifferent to \"the advancement of Science Fiction.\" Mr.\r\n     Shea, can't you see that the publication of first-class\r\n     stories, as in this magazine, is the best possible way to\r\n     popularize Science Fiction? Or do you simply prefer inferior\r\n     stuff?\r\n\r\n     Then there's D. R. Guthrie, from way back in Idaho, who\r\n     liked a yarn in another magazine so much he had to tell us\r\n     all about it--as if we didn't have the best Science Fiction\r\n     ever written right here in Astounding Stories. Guthrie's\r\n     another who seems to prefer brass to gold.\r\n\r\n     Going back an issue or two, we note a letter from Edwin\r\n     Magnuson, a deluded denizen of Duluth, who says he's plumb\r\n     disgusted because Astounding Stories receives far more\r\n     bouquets than brickbats, when according to him the mag\r\n     deserves to be panned plenty. Get in step, Edwin, you're\r\n     falling way behind!\r\n\r\n     And I mustn't forget M. Clifford Johnston of the Newark\r\n     Johnstons, who calls Astounding Stories trash and its\r\n     Readers morons. Well, there are various degrees of mental\r\n     incompetence, and the moron is far above the idiot, Mr.\r\n     Johnston!\r\n\r\n     Now that I've taken a few hasty pokes at those who most\r\n     deserved them, I'll give my own comments on some of your\r\n     latest stories--and anyone who feels like telling me where I\r\n     get off is welcome to do so.\r\n\r\n     First, let me take my hat off to Jack Williamson. I never\r\n     thought much of his stuff in other mags, but his \"The Meteor\r\n     Girl\" was a mighty fine piece of work. Evidently you've got\r\n     to be good to crash Astounding Stories. Interesting as it\r\n     was, though, Williamson's yarn contained a noticeable error.\r\n     In the story, the narrator and his friend witness an event\r\n     occurring twelve hours in the future at a distant place.\r\n     They then travel to that place, reaching it at a time\r\n     exactly corresponding to the time of the event witnessed.\r\n     Therefore, they should have seen themselves in the future\r\n     scene--an obvious fact which the author either failed to\r\n     consider or conveniently ignored. [But--by the story, they\r\n     did not arrive at the rock until just AFTER the events they\r\n     witnessed by means of the fourth dimension. Thus, everything\r\n     is O. K. Take another look.--Ed.] Despite this flaw the\r\n     story embodied several original ideas, had plenty of action,\r\n     and was well told. We can stand more of Williamson.\r\n\r\n     \"Phalanxes of Atlans,\" by F. V. W. Mason, was a corker. When\r\n     writers of Mason's standing turn to Science Fiction, we fans\r\n     have much to be thankful for. Is there any chance of our\r\n     getting a story by Fred MacIsaac, Theodore Roscoe, or Erle\r\n     Stanley Gardner? All of them are first-class writers, and\r\n     they can handle Science Fiction better than many who have\r\n     specialized in that field. The only other suggestion I can\r\n     offer for improving the magazine is to have additional\r\n     illustrations within the stories, such as Wide World\r\n     Adventures used to have.\r\n\r\n     Satisfied as I am with Astounding Stories it will probably\r\n     be a long time before I write again--unless I feel called\r\n     upon to administer a few more verbal spankings to certain\r\n     obstreperous individuals!--Sears Langell, 1214 Boston Road,\r\n     New York, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_The Readers' Corner_\"\r\n\r\nAll Readers are extended a sincere and cordial invitation to \"come\r\nover in 'The Readers' Corner'\" and join in our monthly discussion of\r\nstories, authors, scientific principles and possibilities--everything\r\nthat's of common interest in connection with our Astounding Stories.\r\n\r\nAlthough from time to time the Editor may make a comment or so, this\r\nis a department primarily for Readers, and we want you to make full\r\nuse of it.
