  "content": "Color Images from Mars Rovers\r\n\r\nby Bob Webster\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to Bob Webster for making these images available. They are\r\nrecombinations of images with different colored filters. All images are\r\ncourtesy of NASA/JPL and in the public domain in the United States.\r\n\r\nMars Attacks!\r\n\r\nI was browsing the NASA web site for photos from the Mars rovers, but\r\nmost of them are black and white. Then I noticed they have the raw\r\nimages posted that can be combined into color photos, so I combined a\r\nbunch of them into \"living color.\" Here they are:\r\n\r\n Mars in Color, from “Opportunity”\r\n Opportunity Photos\r\n Mars in Color, from “Spirit”\r\n Spirit Photos\r\n\r\nThe color is not perfect on these, but it should be in the\r\nneighborhood. There are a lot of variables. The cameras are calibrated\r\ndifferently from time to time, there are different bandwidths available\r\nin different images, and the sun is at different angles.\r\n\r\nIn these photos, 3 to 6 images were taken, one after another, using\r\ndifferent bandwidth filters. There may be 5 minutes pass from the first\r\nto the last image, so a shadow may move a little bit during that time.\r\nAn interesting effect of this is an occasional rainbow strip on the\r\nedge of shadows.\r\n\r\nThe image file names include information such as camera type, time\r\ntaken, location, etc. Here is the full info:\r\n\r\nhttp://origin.mars5.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/edr_filename_key.html\r\n\r\nThe image on this site have the filter and sometimes the Left or Right\r\ndesignator removed. If L or R is missing, then they were taken with the\r\nLeft camera, which uses visible light filters.\r\n\r\nThese images were taken with the panoramic camera, because it's the one\r\nthat uses color filters. The filters used vary from image to image. The\r\navailable filters are:\r\n\r\n        Left Camera\r\n        Right Camera\r\n\r\n        1 = EMPTY (clear)\r\n        1 = 436nm (37nm Short-pass)\r\n\r\n        2 = 753nm (20nm bandpass)\r\n        2 = 754nm (20nm bandpass)\r\n\r\n        3 = 673nm (16nm bandpass)\r\n        3 = 803nm (20nm bandpass)\r\n\r\n        4 = 601nm (17nm bandpass)\r\n        4 = 864nm (17nm bandpass)\r\n\r\n        5 = 535nm (20nm bandpass)\r\n        5 = 904nm (26nm bandpass)\r\n\r\n        6 = 482nm (25nm bandpass)\r\n        6 = 934nm (25nm bandpass)\r\n\r\n        7 = 432nm (32nm Short-pass)\r\n        7 = 1009nm (38nm Long-pass)\r\n\r\n        8 = 440nm (20) Solar ND 5.0\r\n        8 = 880nm (20) Solar ND 5.0\r\n\r\nSome bandwidths of visible light are:\r\n\r\n        red\r\n        650\r\n\r\n        orange\r\n        590\r\n\r\n        yellow\r\n        570\r\n\r\n        green\r\n        510\r\n\r\n        blue\r\n        475\r\n\r\n        indigo\r\n        445\r\n\r\n        violet\r\n        400\r\n\r\nEverything gets kind of fuzzy from this point on. The visible light\r\nbandwidths are not even sharply delimited. The bandwidths in the\r\nMartian cameras don't necessarily match the color bandwidths on\r\nEarthling computers. In a lot of the images some of the bandwidths are\r\nmissing. For example, this image:\r\n\r\nonly uses filters 4, 5, and 7, which more or less correspond to\r\nreddish-orange, yellow-green, and violet. There is a hole or two in the\r\nspectrum, notably red and blue, so it ends up looking a little weird.\r\nBut it's still much better than black and white.\r\n\r\nSome of the images from Mars use filters 2, 5, and 7, or some wide\r\nrange like that. This provides more information for scientific\r\nanalysis, but it doesn't look normal when combined. That is, if there\r\nis a \"normal\" for pictures from Mars. I skipped most of these.\r\n\r\nThe right pan camera filters are mainly longer wavelength in the\r\nultraviolet range. I only included one of those pictures, mostly\r\nbecause I wondered what it would look like:\r\n\r\nI used Photo Mud to merge the separate images. In fact, I wrote the\r\nMerge Color Separation function in Photo Mud so I could do this. You\r\ncan download a test version here:\r\n\r\nhttp://xpda.com/photomudsetup.exe\r\n\r\nWhen Photo Mud version 3.0 is released in a few days, I'll replace this\r\nfile with a 30-day trial version. If you download the test version\r\nbefore then, you can have a free update to the release version without\r\na 30-day limit. Let me know if you find any \"design considerations\" or\r\nother things that don't work.\r\n\r\nHere's where to get the latest raw images from Mars:\r\n\r\nhttp://origin.mars5.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/all\r\n\r\nSome of the NASA pictures show mainly red on Mars, such as this\r\npanorama:\r\n\r\nBut the colors in the corners of this sundial in the base of the photo\r\nfrom looks quite a bit different on earth than on the landscape photo.\r\nThere is a lack of blue in the Mars photo, or maybe even a translation\r\nof blue to red. There's probably a good reason for this, since NASA has\r\nbetter software and spent more time on it.\r\n\r\nIt looks to me like NASA included filter 2, infrared light, in their\r\nred color composition. In this image with filter 2, you can see how\r\nbright the lower right color tab is:\r\n\r\nThis one is filter 3, is visible red. The blue tab in the lower right\r\nis not nearly as bright:\r\n\r\nHere is a composition I did using infrared as red, and shifting the\r\ncolors toward that end of the spectrum. This is kind of like the\r\nsundial in the color landscape.\r\n\r\nHere's the image with \"normal color\" composition:\r\n\r\nThe second one looks a lot closer to the original photo above. In these\r\ntwo images, the background dirt looks about the same, but these\r\nsettings make a big difference sometimes.\r\n\r\nPhotos Courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMars in Color, from “Opportunity”\r\n\r\n\r\n4/9/2004\r\n\r\n4/8/2004\r\n\r\n4/7/2004\r\n\r\n4/6/2004\r\n\r\n4/5/2004\r\n\r\n4/5/2004\r\n\r\n4/4/2004\r\n\r\n4/4/2004\r\n\r\n4/4/2004\r\n\r\n4/3/2004\r\n\r\n3/30/2004\r\n\r\n3/28/2004\r\n\r\n3/28/2004\r\n\r\n3/27/2004\r\n\r\n3/24/2004\r\n\r\n3/23/2004\r\n\r\n3/22/2004\r\n\r\n3/22/2004\r\n\r\n3/21/2004\r\n\r\nInfrared used for red\r\n3/20/2004\r\n\r\nfilter 2 (infrared) used for red\r\n3/20/2004\r\n\r\nfilter 2 (infrared) used for red\r\n3/20/2004\r\n\r\n3/20/2004\r\n\r\n3/20/2004\r\n\r\n3/20/2004\r\n\r\n3/19/2004\r\n\r\n3/18/2004\r\n\r\n3/18/2004\r\n\r\n3/17/2004\r\n\r\n3/17/2004\r\n\r\nDubbed \"Carousel,\" the rock in this image was the target of the Mars\r\nExploration Rover Opportunity science team's outcrop \"scuff test.\" On\r\nsol 51 (March 15, 2004), Opportunity slowly rotated its left front\r\nwheel on the rock, abrading it in the same way that geology students\r\nuse a scratch test to determine the hardness of minerals. The image on\r\nthe right, taken by the rover's navigation camera on sol 51, shows the\r\nrock post-scuff. In this image, it is apparent that Opportunity\r\nscratched the surface of \"Carousel\" and deposited dirt that it was\r\ncarrying in its wheel rims.\r\n3/16/2004\r\n\r\n3/16/2004\r\n\r\n3/15/2004\r\n\r\n3/15/2004\r\n\r\n\"Shoemaker's Patio\" near the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity's\r\nlanding site, shows finely layered sediments, which have been\r\naccentuated by erosion. The sphere-like grains or \"blueberries\"\r\ndistributed throughout the outcrop can be seen lining up with\r\nindividual layers. This observation indicates that the spherules are\r\ngeologic features called concretions, which form in pre-existing wet\r\nsediments. Other sphere-like grains, such as impact spherules or\r\nvolcanic lapilli (fragments of material between 2 and 64 millimeters or\r\n.08 and 2.5 inches in maximum dimension that are ejected from a\r\nvolcano) are thought to be deposited with sediments and thus would form\r\nlayers distinct from those of the rocks. This image was captured by the\r\nrover's panoramic camera on the 50th martian day, or sol, of the\r\nmission.\r\n3/15/2004\r\n\r\n3/14/2004\r\n\r\n3/14/2004\r\n\r\nThis image is of the exceptional rock called \"Berry Bowl\" in the \"Eagle\r\nCrater\" outcrop. The study of this \"blueberry-strewn\" area and the\r\nidentification of hematite as the major iron-bearing element within\r\nthese sphere-like grains helped scientists confirm their hypothesis\r\nthat the hematite in these martian spherules was deposited in water. To\r\nseparately analyze the mineralogical content of three main features\r\nwithin this area -- blueberries, dust and rock -- it was important that\r\nthe rock abrasion tool's brush was able to rest on a relatively\r\nberry-free spot. The rock's small size and crowd of berries made the\r\n10-minute brushing a challenge to plan and execute. The successful\r\nbrushing on the target whimsically referred to as \"Near Empty\" on the\r\nrover's 48th sol on Mars left a dust-free impression for subsequent\r\nexamination by the rover's spectrometers. No grinding was necessary on\r\nthe rock because spectral data obtained on the dust-free surface were\r\nsufficient to verify that the rock's chemical composition differs\r\nsignificantly from the hematite-rich berries.\r\n3/13/2004\r\n\r\n3/13/2004\r\n\r\n3/12/2004\r\n\r\n3/12/2004\r\n\r\nThe sphere-like grains or \"blueberries\" distributed throughout the\r\noutcrop can be seen lining up with individual layers. This observation\r\nindicates that the spherules are geologic features called concretions,\r\nwhich form in pre-existing wet sediments. Other sphere-like grains,\r\nsuch as impact spherules or volcanic lapilli (fragments of material\r\nbetween 2 and 64 millimeters or .08 and 2.5 inches in maximum dimension\r\nthat are ejected from a volcano) are thought to be deposited with\r\nsediments and thus would form layers distinct from those of the rocks.\r\n3/11/2004\r\n\r\n3/11/2004\r\n\r\n3/11/2004\r\n\r\nthe 3.1 millimeter-deep (just over one-tenth of an inch) hole ground by\r\nthe Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity's rock abrasion tool in the\r\ntarget called \"Mojo 2\" on \"Flatrock\" was taken on the 44th martian day,\r\nor sol, of the mission. It will help complete the chemical analysis of\r\nthe lowest layer of the outcrop in the crater where the rover now\r\nresides. After a brief brushing on sol 45, the science team plans to\r\nplace Opportunity's spectrometers on the hole to collect data vital to\r\ntheir understanding of this impressive outcrop.\r\nScientists believe that the spherule or \"blueberry\" in the upper right\r\narea of the circular impression was sliced in half by the rock abrasion\r\ntool. \"Blueberries\" are a known obstruction to the grinding tool that\r\ncause it to terminate its sequence. Despite the stall, the rock\r\nabrasion tool abraded \"Flatrock\" for one hour and five minutes,\r\nproducing a cavity ripe for investigation.\r\n3/10/2004\r\n\r\n3/10/2004\r\n\r\n3/9/2004\r\n\r\n3/8/2004\r\n\r\n3/7/2004\r\n\r\n3/7/2004\r\n\r\nThis hole was made by the rover's rock abrasion tool, located on its\r\ninstrument deployment device, or \"arm.\" The hole is located on a target\r\ncalled \"McKittrick\" at the \"El Capitan\" region of the Meridiani Planum,\r\nMars, rock outcrop.

There are also more\r\nabundant, scattered vugs, or small cavities, that are shaped like\r\ndiscs. These are about 1 centimeter (0.4 inches) long.\r\n2/20/2004\r\n\r\n2/20/2004\r\n\r\nThe \"El Capitan\" region of the rock outcrop at Meridiani Planum, Mars.\r\n2/20/2004\r\n\r\nThe \"capture magnet,\" which attracts atmospheric dust particles from\r\nthe front deck of the rover. The lighter-colored areas in the image are\r\nclean sections of the magnet virtually free of dust, and the dark areas\r\nare places where dust has collected. Dust particles in the martian\r\natmosphere are estimated to be about 1 micrometer in size (1/1000th of\r\na millimeter or 1/1000th of .04 inches).\r\nThe material below the magnet's aluminum surface is laid out in\r\nconcentric rings, giving the image a bull's-eye appearance. The magnet\r\nwas designed in this configuration to collect as much atmospheric dust\r\nas possible. Spirit and Opportunity each carry seven magnets.\r\n2/19/2004\r\n\r\nThe Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity dragged one of its wheels back\r\nand forth across the sandy soil at Meridiani Planum to create a hole\r\n(bottom left corner) approximately 50 centimeters (19.7 inches) long by\r\n20 centimeters (7.9 inches) wide by 9 centimeters (3.5 inches) deep.\r\nThe rover's instrument deployment device, or arm, will begin studying\r\nthe fresh soil at the bottom of this trench later today for clues to\r\nits mineral composition and history.

In this image, Spirit's\r\npanoramic camera mast assembly, or camera head, can be seen shadowing\r\nMazatzal's surface. The center of the two brushed spots are\r\napproximately 10 centimeters (3.9 inches) apart and were aggressively\r\nanalyzed by the instruments on the robotic arm on sol 80. On sol 81,\r\nthe rover drilled into the New York target to expose the original rock\r\nunderneath.\r\nNote: The raw images are under the pan camera with color filters. ???\r\n3/24/2004\r\n\r\nNASA's Mars Exploration Rover Spirit took this panoramic camera image\r\nof the rock target named \"Mazatzal\" on sol 77 (March 22, 2004). It is a\r\nclose-up look at the rock face and the targets that will be brushed and\r\nground by the rock abrasion tool in upcoming sols.\r\nMazatzal, like most rocks on Earth and Mars, has layers of material\r\nnear its surface that provide clues about the history of the rock.\r\nScientists believe that the top layer of Mazatzal is actually a coating\r\nof dust and possibly even salts. Under this light coating may be a more\r\nsolid portion of the rock that has been chemically altered by\r\nweathering. Past this layer is the unaltered rock, which may give\r\nscientists the best information about how Mazatzal was formed.\r\nBecause each layer reveals information about the formation and\r\nsubsequent history of Mazatzal, it is important that scientists get a\r\nlook at each of them. For this reason, they have developed a multi-part\r\nstrategy to use the rock abrasion tool to systematically peel back\r\nMazatzal's layers and analyze what's underneath with the rover's\r\nmicroscopic imager, and its Moessbauer and alpha particle X-ray\r\nspectrometers.\r\nThe strategy began on sol 77 when scientists used the microscopic\r\nimager to get a closer look at targets on Mazatzal named \"New York,\"\r\n\"Illinois\" and \"Arizona.\" These rock areas were targeted because they\r\nposed the best opportunity for successfully using the rock abrasion\r\ntool; Arizona also allowed for a close-up look at a range of tones. On\r\nsol 78, Spirit's rock abrasion tool will do a light brushing on the\r\nIllinois target to preserve some of the surface layers. Then, a\r\nbrushing of the New York target should remove the top coating of any\r\ndust and salts and perhaps reveal the chemically altered rock\r\nunderneath. Finally, on sol 79, the rock abrasion tool will be\r\ncommanded to grind into the New York target, which will give scientists\r\nthe best chance of observing Mazatzal's interior.\r\nThe Mazatzal targets were named after the home states of some of the\r\nrock abrasion tool and science team members.\r\n3/23/2004\r\n\r\nused violet for blue\r\n3/22/2004\r\n\r\n3/22/2004\r\n\r\n3/22/2004\r\n\r\n3/22/2004\r\n\r\n3/22/2004\r\n\r\nThis image of the rock called \"Mazatzal\" was taken by the Mars\r\nExploration Rover Spirit. It reveals some interesting features on this\r\nfuture rock abrasion tool target, including variants in tone, a sugary\r\nsurface texture and scalloped areas where parts of the rock seem to\r\nhave been worn away. Mazatzal's uniqueness is made even more obvious\r\nwhen it is compared to the more typical, basaltic rock in the lower\r\nright of the image.\r\n3/21/2004\r\n\r\n3/17/2004\r\n\r\n3/17/2004\r\n\r\nThe Mars Exploration Rover Spirit acquired this navigation camera image\r\non the 72nd martian day, or sol, of its mission (March 15, 2004), after\r\ndigging its wheel into the drift dubbed \"Serpent.\" Creating the\r\ncommands that would generate this \"scar\" was not an easy task for rover\r\ncontrollers. Essentially, they had to choreograph an intricate dance\r\nfor Spirit, maneuvering it up the side of the dune, shimmying its left\r\nfront wheel a number of times to create the scuff, and then reversing\r\nto attain proper positioning for miniature thermal emission\r\nspectrometer observations. Before the task was finished, Spirit moved\r\nforward to put the scuff within proper reach of the rover's arm.\r\nThis scar allows the rover's instruments to see below the drift\r\nsurface, to determine the composition of the materials. Initial results\r\nindicate that the drift material is similar to the basaltic sands that\r\nhave been seen throughout Spirit's journey to the large crater dubbed\r\n\"Bonneville.\" The material does not seem to be the same as that inside\r\nthe crater.\r\nScientists are now looking to answer two questions: Why is the dark\r\nsand in the crater not the same as the dark sand in the drift? And why\r\nare there two different dark soil-type deposits in such a small place?\r\n3/17/2004\r\n\r\n3/17/2004\r\n\r\n3/15/2004\r\n\r\n3/15/2004\r\n\r\n3/14/2004\r\n\r\n3/14/2004\r\n\r\n3/12/2004\r\n\r\n3/11/2004\r\n\r\n3/9/2004\r\n\r\n3/9/2004\r\n\r\n2/28/2004\r\n\r\n2/27/2004\r\n\r\n\"Humphrey\" at Gusev Crater, Mars, the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit's\r\nlanding site. Spirit examined the lumpy rock with its suite of\r\nscientific instruments both before and after it drilled a hole into the\r\nrock surface on the 60th martian day, or sol, of its mission.\r\n\"Humphrey\" was one of several stops on the rover's way to the large\r\ncrater dubbed \"Bonneville.\"\r\n2/27/2004\r\n\r\n2/27/2004\r\n\r\nThe large, shadowed rock in the foreground is nicknamed \"Sandia\" for a\r\nmountain range in New Mexico. An imposing rock, \"Sandia\" is about 33\r\ncentimeters high and about 1.7 meters long. When lightened, this image\r\nreveals much about the pictured rocks, which the science team believes\r\nare ejected material, or ejecta, from the nearby crater called\r\n\"Bonneville.\" Scientists believe \"Sandia\" is a basaltic rock that\r\nlanded on its side after being ejected from the crater. The vertical\r\nlines on the side of the rock facing the camera are known by geologists\r\nas \"flow banding\" and typically run horizontally, indicating that\r\n\"Sandia\" is on its side. What look like small holes on the two visible\r\nsides of the rock are called vesicles; they were probably once gas\r\nbubbles within the lava. Many smaller rocks can be seen in the\r\nbackground of the image. Some rocks are completely exposed, while\r\nothers are only peeking out of the surface. Scientists believe that two\r\nprocesses might be at work here: accretion, which occurs when winds\r\ndeposit material that slowly buries many of the rocks; and deflation,\r\nwhich occurs when surface material is removed by wind, exposing more\r\nand more of the rocks.\r\n\r\n2/26/2004\r\n\r\n2/18/2004\r\n\r\n2/18/2004\r\n\r\n2/17/2004\r\n\r\n2/14/2004\r\n\r\n2/14/2004\r\n\r\n2/14/2004\r\n\r\n2/14/2004\r\n\r\n2/13/2004\r\n\r\n2/13/2004\r\n\r\n2/13/2004\r\n\r\n2/13/2004\r\n\r\n2/13/2004\r\n\r\n2/13/2004\r\n\r\n2/13/2004\r\n\r\n2/13/2004\r\n\r\nMagnetic dust collector\r\n2/12/2004\r\n\r\n2/10/2004\r\n\r\nWhite Boat is the first rock target that Spirit drove to after\r\nfinishing a series of investigations on the rock Adirondack.
