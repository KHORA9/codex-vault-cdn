To attempt even a complete outline of the methods used in\r\nmaking commercial apparatus would involve more than could be undertaken\r\nwithout omitting the essential details of manipulation that a novice\r\nneeds. I have, therefore, confined myself as far as possible to such\r\nwork as will find practical application in the laboratory and will, I\r\nhope, prove of value to those whose interests lie therein.\r\n\r\nThe method of treatment and somewhat disjointed style of writing have\r\nbeen chosen solely with the view to economy of space without the undue\r\nsacrifice of clearness.\r\n\r\n                                              BERNARD D. BOLAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHandbook of Laboratory Glass-Blowing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n     Introduction and Preliminary Remarks--General Principles to\r\n     be observed in Glass Working--Choice of Apparatus--Tools and\r\n     Appliances--Glass.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlass-blowing is neither very easy nor very difficult; there are\r\noperations so easy that the youngest laboratory boy should be able to\r\nrepeat them successfully after once having been shown the way, there are\r\noperations so difficult that years are needed to train eye and hand and\r\njudgment to carry them out; but the greater number of scientific needs\r\nlie between these two extremes. Yet a surprisingly large number of\r\nscientific workers fail even to join a glass tube or make a T piece that\r\nwill not crack spontaneously, and the fault is rather one of\r\nunderstanding than of lack of ability to carry out the necessary\r\nmanipulation.\r\n\r\nIn following the scheme of instruction adopted in this handbook, it will\r\nbe well for the student to pay particular attention to the reason given\r\nfor each detail of the desirable procedure, and, as far as may be, to\r\nmemorise it. Once having mastered the underlying reason, he can evolve\r\nschemes of manipulation to suit his own particular needs, although, as a\r\nrule, those given in the following pages will be found to embody the\r\nresult of many years' experience.\r\n\r\nThere is a wide choice of apparatus, from a simple mouth-blowpipe and a\r\ncandle flame to a power-driven blower and a multiple-jet heating device.\r\nAll are useful, and all have their special applications, but, for the\r\npresent, we will consider the ordinary types of bellows and blowpipes,\r\nsuch as one usually finds in a chemical or physical laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe usual, or Herepath, type of gas blowpipe consists of an outer tube\r\nthrough which coal gas can be passed and an inner tube through which a\r\nstream of air may be blown. Such a blowpipe is shown in section by Fig.\r\n1. It is desirable to have the three centring screws as shown, in order\r\nto adjust the position of the air jet and obtain a well-shaped flame,\r\nbut these screws are sometimes omitted. Fig. 1, _a_ and _b_ show the\r\neffects of defective centring of the air jet, _c_ shows the effect of\r\ndirt or roughness in the inside of the air jet, _d_ shows a satisfactory\r\nflame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 1]\r\n\r\nFor many purposes, it is an advantage to have what is sometimes known\r\nas a \"quick-change\" blowpipe; that is one in which jets of varying size\r\nmay be brought into position without stopping the work for more than a\r\nfraction of a second. Such a device is made by Messrs. Letcher, and is\r\nshown by _e_, and in section by _f_ Fig. 1. It is only necessary to\r\nrotate the desired jet into position in order to connect it with both\r\ngas and air supplies. A small bye-pass ignites the gas, and adjustment\r\nof gas and air may be made by a partial rotation of the cylinder which\r\ncarries the jets.\r\n\r\nFor specially heavy work, where it is needed to heat a large mass of\r\nglass, a multiple blowpipe jet of the pattern invented by my father,\r\nThomas Bolas, as the result of a suggestion derived from a study of the\r\njet used in Griffin's gas furnace, is of considerable value. This jet\r\nconsists of a block of metal in which are drilled seven holes, one being\r\ncentral and the other six arranged in a close circle around the central\r\nhole. To each of these holes is a communication way leading to the gas\r\nsupply, and an air jet is arranged centrally in each. Each hole has also\r\nan extension tube fitted into it, the whole effect being that of seven\r\nblowpipes. In order to provide a final adjustment for the flame, a\r\nperforated plate having seven holes which correspond in size and\r\nposition to the outer tubes is arranged to slide on parallel guides in\r\nfront of these outer tubes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2]\r\n\r\nThe next piece of apparatus for consideration is the bellows, of which\r\nthere are three or more types on the market, although all consist of two\r\nessential parts, the blower or bellows proper and the wind chamber or\r\nreservoir. Two patterns are shown in Fig. 2; _a_, is the form which is\r\ncommonly used by jewellers and metal workers to supply the air blast\r\nnecessary for heating small furnaces. Such a bellows may be obtained at\r\nalmost any jewellers' supply dealer in Clerkenwell, but it not\r\ninfrequently happens that the spring in the wind chamber is too strong\r\nfor glass-blowing, and hence the air supply tends to vary in pressure.\r\nThis can be improved by fitting a weaker spring, but an easier way and\r\none that usually gives fairly satisfactory results, is to place an\r\nordinary screw-clip on the rubber tube leading from the bellows to the\r\nblowpipe, and to tighten this until an even blast is obtained.\r\n\r\nAnother form of bellows, made by Messrs. Fletcher and Co., and common in\r\nmost laboratories, is shown by _b_; the wind chamber consists of a disc\r\nof india-rubber clamped under a circular frame or tied on to a circular\r\nrim. This form is shown by Fig. 2, _b_.\r\n\r\nThe third form, and one which my own experience has caused me to prefer\r\nto any other, is cylindrical, and stands inside the pedestal of the\r\nblowpipe-table. A blowpipe-table of this description is made by Enfer of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nThere is no need, however, to purchase an expensive table for laboratory\r\nuse. All the work described in this book can quite well be done with a\r\nsimple foot bellows and a quick-change blowpipe. Nearly all of it can be\r\ndone with a single jet blowpipe, such as that described first, or even\r\nwith the still simpler apparatus mentioned on page 84, but I do not\r\nadvise the beginner to practise with quite so simple a form at first,\r\nand for that reason have postponed a description of it until the last\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nGlass-blowers' tools and appliances are many and various, quite a number\r\nof them are better rejected than used, but there are a few essentials.\r\nThese are,--file, glass-knife, small turn-pin, large turn-pin, carbon\r\ncones, carbon plate, rubber tube of small diameter, various sizes of\r\ncorks, and an asbestos heat reflector. For ordinary work, an annealing\r\noven is not necessary, but one is described on page 60 in connection\r\nwith the special cases where annealing is desirable.\r\n\r\nFig. 3 illustrates the tools and appliances. _a_ is an end view of the\r\ndesirable form of file, and shows the best method of grinding the edges\r\nin order to obtain a highly satisfactory tool. _b_ is a glass knife,\r\nshown both in perspective and end view, it is made of glass-hard steel\r\nand should be sharpened on a rough stone, such as a scythe-stone, in\r\norder to give a slightly irregular edge. _c_ is a small turn-pin which\r\nmay be made by flattening and filing the end of a six-inch nail. _d_ is\r\nthe large turn-pin and consists of a polished iron spike, about five\r\ninches long and a quarter of an inch diameter at its largest part. This\r\nshould be mounted in a wooden handle. _e_ and _f_ are carbon cones. A\r\nthin rubber tube is also useful; it may be attached to the work and\r\nserve as a blowing tube, thus obviating the necessity of moving the work\r\nto the mouth when internal air pressure is to be applied. In order to\r\navoid undue repetition, the uses of these tools and appliances will be\r\ndescribed as they occur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3]\r\n\r\nGlass, as usually supplied by chemical apparatus dealers is of the\r\ncomposition known as \"soda-glass.\" They also supply \"hard\" or\r\n\"combustion\" glass, but this is only used for special purposes, as it is\r\ntoo infusible for convenient working in the ordinary blowpipe flame.\r\n\r\nSoda-glass consists primarily of silicate of sodium with smaller\r\nquantities of silicate of aluminum and potassium. Its exact composition\r\nvaries. It is not blackened, as lead glass is, by exposure to the\r\nreducing gases which are present in the blue cone of a blowpipe flame,\r\nand hence is easier for a beginner to work without producing\r\ndiscolouration.\r\n\r\nFurther notes on glasses will be found on page 55, but for ordinary\r\npurposes soda-glass will probably be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n     Easy Examples of Laboratory Glass-Blowing--Cutting and\r\n     Sealing Tubes for Various Purposes; Test-Tubes,\r\n     Pressure-Tubes, Tubes for High Temperature\r\n     Experiments--Thermometer-Bulbs, Bulbs of Special Glass,\r\n     Pipettes, Absorption-Bulbs or Washing-Bulbs--Joining Tubes;\r\n     Branches, Exhaustion-Branches, Branches of Dissimilar\r\n     Glass--Blowing Bulbs; A Thistle Funnel; Cracking and\r\n     Breaking Glass; Leading and Direction of Cracks--Use of\r\n     Glass Rod or Strips of Window-Glass; Joining Rod, Feet and\r\n     Supports--Gripping Devices for use in Corrosive\r\n     Solutions--The Building Up of Special Forms from Solid\r\n     Glass.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most common need of the glass-blower whose work is connected\r\nwith that of the laboratory is for a sealed tube; and the sealing of a\r\ntube is an excellent preliminary exercise in glass-blowing.\r\n\r\nWe will assume that the student has adjusted the blowpipe to give a\r\nflame similar to that shown in _d_, Fig. 1, and that he has learned to\r\nmaintain a steady blast of air with the bellows; further, we will assume\r\nthat the tube he wishes to seal is of moderate size, say not more than\r\nhalf an inch in diameter and with walls of from one-tenth to one-fifth\r\nof an inch thick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4]\r\n\r\nA convenient length of tube for the first trial is about one foot; this\r\nshould be cut off from the longer piece, in which it is usually\r\nsupplied, as follows:--lay the tube on a flat surface and make a deep\r\ncut with the edge of a file. Do not \"saw\" the file to and fro over the\r\nglass. If the file edge has been ground as shown in _a_, Fig. 3, such a\r\nprocedure will be quite unnecessary and only involve undue wear; one\r\nmovement with sufficient pressure to make the file \"bite\" will give a\r\ndeep cut. Now rotate the tube through about one-eighth of a turn and\r\nmake another cut in continuation of the first. Take the tube in the\r\nhands, as shown in _a_, Fig. 4, and apply pressure with the thumbs, at\r\nthe same time straining at the ends. The tube should break easily. If it\r\ndoes not, do not strain too hard, as it may shatter and cause serious\r\ninjuries to the hands, but repeat the operation with the file and so\r\ndeepen the original cuts. In holding a tube for breaking, it is\r\nimportant to place the hands as shown in sketch, as this method is least\r\nlikely to cause shattering and also minimises the risk of injury even if\r\nthe tube should shatter. To cut a large tube, or one having very thick\r\nwalls, it is better to avoid straining altogether and to break by\r\napplying a small bead of intensely heated glass to the file cut. If the\r\nwalls are very thin, a glass-blower's knife should be used instead of a\r\nfile. The tube and glass-blower's knife should be held in the hand, and\r\nthe tube rotated against the edge of the knife; this will not produce a\r\ndeep cut, but is less likely to break the tube. A bead of hot glass\r\nshould be used to complete the work.\r\n\r\nThe next operation is to heat the glass tube in the middle; this must be\r\ndone gradually and evenly; that is to say the tube must be rotated\r\nduring heating and held some considerable distance in front of the flame\r\nat first; otherwise the outer surface of the glass will expand before\r\nthe interior is affected and the tube will break. From two to five\r\nminutes, heating at a distance of about eight inches in front of the\r\nflame will be found sufficient in most cases, and another minute should\r\nbe taken in bringing the tube into the flame. Gradual heating is\r\nimportant, but even heating is still more important and this can only be\r\nobtained by uniform and steady rotation. Until the student can rotate a\r\ntube steadily _without thinking about it_, real progress in\r\nglass-blowing is impossible.\r\n\r\nWhen the tube is in the flame it must be held just in front of the blue\r\ncone and rotated until the glass is soft enough to permit the ends to be\r\ndrawn apart. Continue to separate the ends and, at the same time, move\r\nthe tube very slightly along its own axis, so that the flame tends to\r\nplay a little more on the thicker part than on the drawn-out portion. If\r\nthis is done carefully, the drawn-out portion can be separated off,\r\nleaving only a slight \"bleb\" on the portion it is desired to seal. This\r\nis illustrated by _b_, Fig. 4.\r\n\r\nTo convert the seal at _b_, Fig. 4., into the ordinary form of test-tube\r\nseal, it is only necessary to heat the \"bleb\" a little more strongly,\r\nblow gently into the tube until the thick portion is slightly expanded,\r\nre-heat the whole of the rounded end until it is beginning to collapse,\r\nand give a final shaping by careful blowing after it has commenced to\r\ncool. In each case the glass must be removed from the flame before\r\nblowing. The finished seal is shown by _c_, Fig. 4. If desired, the open\r\nend may now be finished by heating and rotating the soft glass against\r\nthe large turn-pin, as illustrated in _d_, but the turn-pin must not be\r\nallowed to become too hot, as if this happens it will stick to the\r\nglass. After turning out the end, the lip of glass must be heated to\r\nredness and allowed to cool without coming in contact with anything;\r\notherwise it will be in a condition of strain and liable to crack\r\nspontaneously. The finished test-tube is shown by _e_.\r\n\r\nWhen it is necessary to seal a substance inside a glass tube, the bottom\r\nof the tube is first closed, as explained above, and allowed to cool;\r\nthe substance, if a solid, is now introduced, but should not come to\r\nwithin less than two inches of the point where the second seal is to be\r\nmade. If the substance is a liquid it can more conveniently be\r\nintroduced at a later stage.\r\n\r\nNow bring the tube into the blowpipe flame gradually, and rotate it,\r\nwhile heating, at the place where it is to be closed. Allow the glass to\r\nsoften and commence to run together until the diameter of the tube is\r\nreduced to about half its original size. Remove from the flame and draw\r\nthe ends apart, this should give a long, thick extension as shown by\r\n_f_, Fig. 4. If any liquid is to be introduced, it may now be done by\r\ninserting a thin rubber or other tube through the opening and running\r\nthe liquid in. A glass tube should be used with caution for introducing\r\nthe liquid, as any hard substance will tend to scratch the inside of the\r\nglass and cause cracking. The final closure is made by melting the\r\ndrawn-out extension in the blowpipe flame; the finished seal being shown\r\nby _g_, Fig. 4.\r\n\r\nIf the sealed tube has to stand internal pressure, it is desirable to\r\nallow the glass to thicken somewhat more before drawing out, and the\r\nbottom seal should also be made thicker. For such a tube, and especially\r\nwhen it has to stand heating, as in a Carius determination of chlorine,\r\neach seal should be cooled very slowly by rotating it in a gas flame\r\nuntil the surface is covered with a thick layer of soot, and it should\r\nthen be placed aside in a position where the hot glass will not come in\r\ncontact with anything, and where it will be screened from all draughts.\r\n\r\n_Joining Tube._--We will now consider the various forms of join in glass\r\ntubing which are met with in the laboratory. First, as being easiest, we\r\nwill deal with the end-to-end joining of two tubes of similar glass.\r\n_a_, _b_, and _c_, Fig. 5, illustrate this. One end of one of the tubes\r\nshould be closed, a lip should be turned out on each of the ends to be\r\njoined, and both lips heated simultaneously until the glass is\r\nthoroughly soft. Now bring the lips together gently, until they are in\r\ncontact at all points and there are no places at which air can escape;\r\nremove from the flame, and blow slowly and very cautiously until the\r\njoint is expanded as shown in _b_, Fig. 5. Reheat in the flame until\r\nthe glass has run down to rather less than the original diameter of the\r\ntube, and give a final shaping by re-blowing. The chief factors of\r\nsuccess in making such a join are, thorough heating of the glass before\r\nbringing the two tubes together, and avoidance of hard or sudden blowing\r\nwhen expanding the joint. The finished work is shown by _c_, Fig. 5.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5]\r\n\r\nTo join a small glass tube to the end of a large one, the large tube\r\nshould first be sealed, a small spot on the extreme end of the seal\r\nheated, and air pressure used to expand the heated spot as shown in _d_.\r\nThis expanded spot is then re-heated and blown out until it bursts as\r\nshown in _e_, the thin fragments of glass are removed and the end of the\r\nsmall tube turned out as shown in _f_. After this the procedure is\r\nsimilar to that used in jointing two tubes of equal size.\r\n\r\nWhen these two forms of joint have been mastered, a T piece will present\r\nbut little difficulty. It is made in three stages as shown in Fig. 5,\r\nand the procedure is similar to that used in joining a large and small\r\ntube. Care should be taken to avoid softening the top of the \"T\" too\r\nmuch, or the glass will bend and distort the finished work; although a\r\nslight bend can be rectified by re-heating and bending back. Local\r\nre-heating is often useful in giving the joint its final shape.\r\n\r\nAn exhaustion branch is often made by a totally different method. This\r\nmethod is shown by _g_, _h_, and _i_, Fig. 5; _g_ is the tube on which\r\nthe branch is to be made. The end of a rod of similar glass should be\r\nheated until a mass of thoroughly liquid glass has collected, as shown,\r\nand at the same time a spot should be heated on that part of the tube\r\nwhere it is desired to make the branch. The mass of hot glass on the rod\r\nis now brought in contact with the heated spot on the tube and expanded\r\nby blowing as shown by _h_. The air pressure in the tube is still\r\nmaintained while the rod is drawn away as shown by _i_. This will give a\r\nhollow branch which may be cut off at any desired point, and is then\r\nready for connection to the vacuum pump.\r\n\r\nIf the rod used is of a dissimilar glass, the branch should be blown\r\nmuch thinner. Such a branch will often serve as a useful basis for\r\njoining two tubes of different composition, as the ordinary type of\r\nbranch is more liable to crack when made with two glasses having\r\ndifferent coefficients of expansion.\r\n\r\n_Blowing Bulbs._--A bulb may be blown on a closed tube such as that\r\nshown by _c_, Fig. 5, by rotating it in the blowpipe flame until the end\r\nis softened, removing it from the flame and blowing cautiously. It is\r\ndesirable to continue the rotation during blowing. In the case of a very\r\nsmall tube, it is sufficient to melt the end without previous sealing,\r\nrotate it in the flame until enough glass has collected, remove from the\r\nflame and blow while keeping the tube in rotation.\r\n\r\n_Thermometer Bulbs._--If the thermometer is to be filled with mercury,\r\nit is desirable to use a rubber bulb for blowing, as moisture is liable\r\nto condense inside the tube when the mouth is used, and this moisture\r\nwill cause the mercury thread to break. In any case, a slight pressure\r\nshould be maintained inside the thermometer tube while it is in the\r\nflame; otherwise the fine capillary tube will close and it will be very\r\ndifficult to expand the heated glass into a bulb.\r\n\r\n_Large Bulbs._--When a large bulb is needed on a small or medium sized\r\ntube, it is often necessary to provide more glass than would be obtained\r\nif the bulb were blown in the ordinary way. One method is to expand the\r\ntube in successive stages along its axis, as shown by _a_, Fig. 6. These\r\nexpanded portions are then re-heated, so that they run together into one\r\nhollow mass from which the bulb is blown; _b_ and _c_, illustrate this.\r\nAnother method, and one which is useful for very large bulbs, is to\r\nfuse on a length of large, thick-walled, tubing. The heat reflector,\r\n_g_, Fig. 3, should be used, if necessary, when making large bulbs. It\r\nconsists of a sheet of asbestos mounted in a foot, and is used by being\r\nplaced close to the mass of glass on the side away from the blowpipe\r\nflame while the glass is being heated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6]\r\n\r\n_Bulbs of Dissimilar Glass._--These may be made by the second method\r\ngiven under \"Large Bulbs,\" but the joint should be blown as thin as\r\npossible. Further instructions in the use of unlike glasses are given on\r\npage 94.\r\n\r\n_A Bulb in the Middle of a Tube._--Unless the bulb is to be quite small,\r\nit will be necessary to join in a piece of thick glass tubing, or to\r\ndraw the thin tube out from a larger piece, thus leaving a thick mass in\r\nthe middle as shown by _d_, Fig. 6. This mass of glass should now be\r\nrotated in the blowpipe flame until it is quite soft and on the point of\r\nrunning together. Considerable practice will be necessary before the two\r\nends of the tube can be rotated at the same speed and without\r\n\"wobbling,\" but this power must be acquired. When the glass is\r\nthoroughly hot, remove from the flame, hold in a horizontal position,\r\nand expand by blowing. It is essential to continue the rotation while\r\nthis is done. Should one part of the bulb tend to expand more than the\r\nother, turn the expanded part to the bottom, pause for about a second,\r\nboth in rotating and blowing, in order that the lower portion may be\r\ncooled by ascending air-currents; then continue blowing and turning as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n_Absorption Bulbs or Washing Bulbs._--These are made by an elaboration\r\nof the processes given in the last paragraph, _g_, _h_, and _i_, Fig. 6,\r\nillustrate this.\r\n\r\n_A Thistle Funnel._--This is made by blowing a fairly thick-walled bulb\r\non a glass tube, bursting a hole by heating and blowing, and enlarging\r\nthe burst-out part by heating and rotating against a turn-pin.\r\n\r\n_Bending Glass Tube._--Small tubing may be bent in a flat flame gas\r\nburner and offers no special difficulty. Large or thin-walled tubing\r\nshould be heated in the blowpipe flame and a slight bend made; another\r\nzone of the tube, just touching the first bend, should now be heated and\r\nanother slight bend made. In this way it is possible to avoid flattening\r\nand a bend having any required angle can gradually be produced. A final\r\nshaping of the bend may be made by heating in a large blowpipe flame and\r\nexpanding slightly by air pressure.\r\n\r\n_Glass Spirals._--If a tube is heated by means of a long, flat-flame\r\nburner, the softened tube may be wound on to an iron mandrel which has\r\npreviously been covered with asbestos. The mandrel should be made\r\nslightly conical in order to facilitate withdrawal. It is desirable to\r\nheat the surface of the asbestos almost to redness by means of a second\r\nburner, and thus avoid undue chilling of the glass and the consequent\r\nproduction of internal strain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7]\r\n\r\n_A Thermo-Regulator for Gas._--Fig. 7, _a-e_, shows an easily\r\nconstructed thermo-regulator. The mercury reservoir, _a_, and the upper\r\npart, _b_, are made by joining two larger pieces of tubing on to the\r\ncapillary. The gas inlet passes through a rubber stopper, in order to\r\nallow of adjustment for depth of insertion, and the bye-pass branches,\r\n_d_ and _e_, are connected by a piece of rubber tubing which can be\r\ncompressed by means of a screw clip, thus providing a means of\r\nregulating the bye-pass.\r\n\r\n_Use of Glass Rod._--Apart from its most common laboratory use for\r\nstirring; glass rod may be used in building up such articles as\r\ninsulating feet for electrical apparatus or acid-resisting cages for\r\nchemical purposes. Such a cage is shown by _f_, _g_ and _h_, Fig. 7.\r\nFurther, by an elaboration of the method of making an exhaustion branch,\r\ngiven on page 18, blown articles may also be constructed from rod. Note\r\nthe added parts of _e_, Fig. 9.\r\n\r\n_A Simple Foot._--The form of foot shown by Fig. 7, _k_, is easy to make\r\nand has many uses. First join a glass rod to a length of glass tubing as\r\nshown (the joint should be expanded slightly by blowing), cut off the\r\ntube and heat the piece remaining on the rod until it can be turned out\r\nas shown by _i_. This should be done with the large turn-pin, and care\r\nshould be taken not to heat the supporting rod too strongly, otherwise\r\nthe piece of tube will become bent and distorted; it is better to\r\ncommence by heating the edge of the piece of tube and turn out a lip,\r\nthen extend the heating by degrees and turn out more and more until the\r\nfoot looks like that shown by _i_.\r\n\r\nWe now need to make three projections of glass rod. These are produced\r\nas follows:--Heat the end of the glass rod until a thoroughly melted\r\nmass of glass has accumulated (the rod must be rotated while this is\r\nbeing done, otherwise the glass will drop off); when sufficient melted\r\nglass has been obtained, the edge of the turned-out foot should be\r\nheated to dull redness over about one-third of its circumference, and\r\nthe melted glass on the rod should be drawn along the heated portion\r\nuntil both are so completely in contact as to form one mass of\r\nsemi-fluid glass. The rod should now be drawn away slowly, and, finally,\r\nseparated by melting off, thus producing a flat projection. A repetition\r\nof the process will give the other two projections, and the finished\r\nfoot may be adjusted to stand upright by heating the projections\r\nslightly and standing it on the carbon plate mentioned on page 7. After\r\nthe foot is adjusted it should be annealed slightly by heating to just\r\nbelow the softening point of the glass and then rotating in a smoky gas\r\nflame until it is covered with a deposit of carbon, after which it\r\nshould be allowed to cool in a place free from draughts and where the\r\nhot glass will not come in contact with anything. The finished foot is\r\nshown by _k_, Fig. 7.\r\n\r\n_Building up from Glass Rod._--A glass skeleton-work can be constructed\r\nfrom rod without much difficulty, and is sometimes useful as a container\r\nfor a substance which has to be treated with acid, or for similar\r\npurposes. The method is almost sufficiently explained by the\r\nillustration in Fig. 7; _f_ shows the initial stage, _g_ the method of\r\nconstruction of the net-work, and _h_ the finished container. It is\r\nconvenient to introduce the substance at the stage indicated by _g_. The\r\nimportant points to observe in making this contrivance are that the\r\nglass rod must be kept hot by working while it is actually in the flame,\r\nand that the skeleton must be made as thin as possible with the\r\navoidance of heavy masses of glass at any place. If these details are\r\nneglected it will be almost certain to crack.\r\n\r\n_Stirrers._--These are usually made from glass rod, and no special\r\ninstructions are necessary for their construction, except that the glass\r\nshould be in a thoroughly fused condition before making any joins and\r\nthe finished join should be annealed slightly by covering with a deposit\r\nof soot, as explained on page 16. The flat ends shown in _a_, Fig. 8,\r\nare made by squeezing the soft glass rod between two pieces of carbon,\r\nand should be re-heated to dull redness after shaping. Fig. 8 also shows\r\nvarious forms of stirrer.\r\n\r\nIn order to carry out stirring operations in the presence of a gas or\r\nmixture of gases other than air, some form of gland or seal may be\r\nnecessary where the stirrer passes through the bearing in which it runs.\r\nA flask to which is fitted a stirrer and gas seal is shown in section by\r\n_b_, Fig. 8. The liquid used in this seal may be mercury, petroleum, or\r\nany other that the experimental conditions indicate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8]\r\n\r\nIf the bearing for a stirrer is made of glass tube, it is desirable to\r\nlubricate rather freely; otherwise heat will be produced by the\r\nfriction of the stirrer and the tube will probably crack. Such\r\nlubrication may be supplied by turning out the top of the bearing tube\r\nand filling the turned-out portion with petroleum jelly mixed with a\r\nsmall quantity of finely ground or, better, colloidal graphite, and the\r\nbearing should also be lubricated with the same composition. Care\r\nshould be taken not to employ so soft a lubricant or so large an excess\r\nas to cause it to run down the stirrer into the liquid which is being\r\nstirred.\r\n\r\n_Leading a Crack._--It sometimes happens that a large bulb or specially\r\nthin-walled tube has to be divided. In such a case it is scarcely\r\npracticable to use the method recommended for small tubes on page 12,\r\nbut it is quite easy to lead a crack in any desired direction. A\r\nconvenient starting point is a file cut; this is touched with hot glass\r\nuntil a crack is initiated. A small flame or a bead of hot glass is now\r\nused to heat the article at a point about a quarter of an inch from the\r\nend of the crack and in whatever direction it has to be led. The crack\r\nwill now extend towards the source of heat, which should be moved\r\nfarther away as the crack advances. In this manner a crack may be caused\r\nto take any desired path and can be led round a large bulb.\r\n\r\n_Cutting Glass with the Diamond._--Slips of window-glass can be used in\r\nplace of glass rod for some purposes, and as cutting them involves the\r\nuse of the glaziers' diamond or a wheel-cutter, they may well be\r\nmentioned under this heading.\r\n\r\nIn cutting a sheet of glass with the diamond, one needs a flat surface\r\non which to rest the glass, and a rule against which to guide the\r\ndiamond. The diamond should be held in an almost vertical position, and\r\ndrawn over the surface of the glass with slight pressure. While this is\r\nbeing done the angle of the diamond should be changed by bringing the\r\ntop of the handle forward until the sound changes from one of scratching\r\nto a clear singing note. When this happens the diamond is cutting. A few\r\ntrials will teach the student the correct angle for the diamond with\r\nwhich he works, and the glass, if properly cut, will break easily. If\r\nthe cut fails it is better to turn the glass over and make a\r\ncorresponding cut on the other side rather than make any attempt to\r\nimprove the original cut. The diamond is seldom used for cutting small\r\nglass tubes.\r\n\r\nThe use of the wheel-cutter calls for no special mention as it will cut\r\nat any angle, although the pressure required is somewhat greater than\r\nthat needed by most diamonds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n     Internal Seals, Air-Traps, Spray Arresters,\r\n     Filter-Pumps--Sprays, Condensers; Plain, Double Surface, and\r\n     Spherical--Soxhlet Tubes and Fat Extraction\r\n     Apparatus--Vacuum Tubes, Electrode Work, Enclosed\r\n     Thermometers, Alarm Thermometers, Recording Thermometers,\r\n     \"Spinning\" Glass.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Internal Seals._--It is convenient to class those cases in which a\r\nglass tube passes through the wall of another tube or bulb under the\r\nheading of \"Internal Seals.\" These are met with in barometers, spray\r\narresters, and filter pumps, in condensers and some forms of vacuum\r\ntube. The two principal methods of making such seals will be considered\r\nfirst and their special application afterwards.\r\n\r\n_An Air Trap on a Barometer Tube._--This involves the use of the first\r\nmethod, and is perhaps the simplest example that can be given. Fig. 9,\r\n_a_, _a1_ and _a2_, show the stages by which this form of internal seal\r\nis made. For the first trials, it is well to work with fairly\r\nthick-walled tubing, which should be cut into two pieces, each being\r\nabout eight inches long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9]\r\n\r\nFirst seal the end of one tube as described on page 13, heat the sealed\r\nend and expand to a thick walled bulb. Fuse the end of the other tube,\r\nattach a piece of glass rod to serve as a handle, and draw out; cut off\r\nthe drawn-out portion: leaving an end like _a_.\r\n\r\nNow heat a small spot at the end of the bulb, blow, burst out, and\r\nremove the thin fragments of glass. Heat a zone on the other tube at the\r\npoint where the drawn-out portion commences and expand as shown by _a1_.\r\n\r\nThe next stage is to join the tubes. Heat the ragged edges of the\r\nburst-out portion until they are thoroughly rounded. At the same time\r\nheat the drawn-out tube to just below softening point. Then, while the\r\nrounded edges of the burst-out portion are still soft, insert the other\r\ntube; rotate the join in the blowpipe flame until it is quite soft, and\r\nexpand by blowing. If necessary, re-heat and expand again. The finished\r\nseal, which should be slightly annealed by smoking in a sooty flame, is\r\nshown by _a2_.\r\n\r\n_A Spray Arrester._--This is made by the second method, in which the\r\npiece of tube which projects inside the bulb is fused in position first\r\nand the outer tube is then joined on. The various stages of making are\r\nillustrated by _b_, _b1_ and _b2_, Fig. 9.\r\n\r\nA bulb is blown between two tubes by the method given on page 22, the\r\nlarger tube is then cut off and the small piece of tube introduced into\r\nthe bulb after having been shaped as shown in by _b_, Fig. 9. The\r\nopening in the bulb is sealed as shown by _b1_. The sealed part is now\r\nheated and the bulb inclined downwards until the inner tube comes in\r\ncontact with the seal and is fused in position. This operation requires\r\nsome practice in order to prevent the inner tube either falling through\r\nthe soft glass or becoming unsymmetrical. The end of the bulb, where the\r\ninner tube comes in contact with it, is now perforated by heating and\r\nblowing, thus giving the form shown by _b2_, and the outer tube is\r\njoined on. The finished spray arrester is shown by _b3_. Practice alone\r\nwill give the power to produce a symmetrical and stable piece of work.\r\n\r\n_Two Forms of Filter Pump._--That illustrated by _d_, Fig. 9, is made by\r\nthe method explained under \"An Air Trap on a Barometer Tube.\" That\r\nillustrated by _c_ is made by the method explained under \"A Spray\r\nArrester.\" No new manipulation is involved, and the construction should\r\nbe clear from a study of the drawings.\r\n\r\n_Multiple and Branched Internal Seals._--A fuller consideration of these\r\nwill be found on page 39, but one general principle may well be borne in\r\nmind; that, as far as is possible, a tube having both ends fastened\r\ninside another tube or bulb should be curved or have a spiral or bulb at\r\nsome point in its length, otherwise any expansion or contraction will\r\nput great strain on the joints.\r\n\r\n_Sprays._--A spray which is easy to make, easy to adjust, and easy to\r\nclean after use is shown by _e_, Fig. 9. The opening on the top of the\r\nbulb is made by melting on a bead of glass, expanding, bursting, and\r\nfusing the ragged edges. The two branches which form the spray producing\r\njunction are made by the method used for an exhaustion branch and\r\ndescribed on page 18.\r\n\r\nA spray which can be introduced through the neck of a bottle is shown by\r\n_h_, Fig. 9. The various stages in making this are illustrated by _f_,\r\nand _g_. If the inner tube is made by drawing out from a larger piece of\r\nglass so that two supporting pieces are left on each side of the place\r\nwhere it is intended to make the final bend, that bend can be made in a\r\nflat-flame gas burner without causing the inner tube to come in contact\r\nwith the walls of the outer tube. Care must be taken when joining on the\r\nside piece that the inner tube is not heated enough to fuse it. The\r\nsmall hole in the side of the outer tube is produced by heating and\r\nbursting.\r\n\r\n_A Liebig's Condenser._--This consists of a straight glass tube passing\r\nthrough an outer cooling jacket. In practice it is better to make the\r\njacket as a separate piece, and to effect a water-tight junction by\r\nmeans of two short rubber tubes. It may, however, be made with two\r\ninternal seals of the class described under \"A Spray Arrester.\" There is\r\nmuch less risk of these seals cracking if the inner tube is made in the\r\nform of a spiral or has a number of bulbs blown on it in order to give a\r\ncertain amount of elasticity.\r\n\r\n_A Double-Surface Condenser._--Fig. 10 shows a condenser of this nature\r\nwhich is supplied by Messrs. Baird and Tatlock. It may be built up in\r\nstages as shown by _a_, _b_, and _c_, but the work involved requires\r\nconsiderable skill, and the majority of laboratory workers will find it\r\ncheaper to buy than to make.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10]\r\n\r\n_A Spherical Condenser._--Such a condenser as that shown by _f_, Fig 10,\r\ninvolves a method which may find application in a number of cases. The\r\nouter bulb is blown from a thick piece of tubing which has been inserted\r\nin a smaller piece (see _d_, Fig. 6); then the inner bulb by similar\r\nmethod. It is now necessary to introduce the smaller bulb into the\r\nlarger, and for this purpose the larger bulb must be cut into halves. A\r\nsmall but deep cut is made with the file or glass-blowers' knife in the\r\nmiddle of the larger bulb, and at right angles to the axis of the tube\r\non which it is blown. A minute bead of intensely heated glass is now\r\nbrought in contact with the cut in order to start a crack. This crack\r\nmay now be led round the bulb as described on page 30. If the work is\r\ncarried out with care, it is possible to obtain the bulb in two halves\r\nas shown by _d_, and these two halves will correspond so exactly that\r\nwhen the cut edges are placed in contact they will be almost air-tight.\r\nThe two tubes from the smaller bulb should be cut to such a length that\r\nthey will just rest inside the larger, and the ends should be expanded.\r\nPlace the inner bulb in position and fit the two halves of the outer\r\nbulb together, taking great care not to chip the edges. If the length of\r\nthe tubes on the inner bulb has been adjusted properly, the inner bulb\r\nwill be supported in position by their contact with the tubes on the\r\nouter bulb. Now rotate the cracked portion of the outer bulb in front\r\nof a blowpipe flame and press the halves together very gently as the\r\nglass softens. Expand slightly by blowing if necessary. If a small\r\npin-hole develops at the joint it is sometimes possible to close this\r\nwith a bead of hot glass; but if the bulb has been cut properly there\r\nshould be no pin-holes formed. The condenser is finished by joining on\r\nthe side tubes and sealing the inner tube through by the methods already\r\ngiven. In order to blow bulbs large enough to make a useful condenser,\r\nit will be convenient to employ the multiple-jet blowpipe described on\r\npage 4.\r\n\r\n_A Soxhlet-Tube or Extraction Apparatus._--This involves the\r\nconstruction of a re-entrant join where the syphon flows into the lower\r\ntube. It is of considerable value as an exercise and the complete\r\napparatus is easy to make.\r\n\r\nA large tube is sealed at the bottom and the top is lipped, as in making\r\na test-tube. A smaller tube is then joined on by a method similar to\r\nthat given on page 18, but without making a perforation in the bottom of\r\nthe large tube. Heating and expanding by air pressure, first through the\r\nlarge tube, then through the smaller tube and then again through the\r\nlarge tube, will give a satisfactory finish to this part of the work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11]\r\n\r\nThe syphon tube is now joined on to the large tube as shown by _a_, Fig.\r\n11, care being taken to seal the other end of the syphon tube before\r\njoining. The details of the final and re-entrant joint of the syphon\r\ntube are shown at the lower part of _a_. This join is made by expanding\r\nthe sealed end of the syphon tube into a small, thick-walled bulb, and\r\nthe bottom of this bulb is burst out by local heating and blowing; the\r\nfragments of glass are removed and the edges made smooth by melting. A\r\nsimilar operation is carried out on the side of the tube to which the\r\nsyphon tube is to be joined. This stage is shown by _a_. Now heat the\r\nsyphon tube at the upper bend until it is flexible, and press the bulb\r\nat its end into the opening on the side of the other tube. Hold the\r\nglass thus until the syphon is no longer flexible. The final join is\r\nmade by heating the two contacting surfaces, if necessary pressing the\r\nedges in contact with the end of a turn-pin, fusing together and\r\nexpanding. The finished apparatus is shown by _c_.\r\n\r\n_Electrodes._--A thin platinum wire may be sealed into a capillary tube\r\nwithout any special precautions being necessary. The capillary tube may\r\nbe drawn out from the side of a larger tube by heating a spot on the\r\nglass, touching with a glass rod and drawing the rod away; or the\r\nexhaustion branch described on page 18 may be used for the introduction\r\nof an electrode. It is convenient sometimes to carry out the exhaustion\r\nthrough the same tube that will afterwards serve for the electrode. The\r\nelectrode wire is laid inside the branch before connecting to the\r\nexhaustion pump. When exhaustion is completed the tube is heated until\r\nthe soft glass flows round the platinum and makes the seal air-tight.\r\nThe branch is now cut off close to the seal on the pump side, a loop is\r\nmade in the projecting end of the platinum wire, and the seal is\r\nfinished by melting the cut-off end.\r\n\r\nPlatinum is usually employed for such work, but if care is taken to\r\navoid oxidation it is not impossible to make fairly satisfactory seals\r\nwith clean iron or nickel wire. Hard rods of fine graphite, such as are\r\nused in some pencils, may also be sealed into glass, but it seems\r\nprobable that air would diffuse through the graphite in the course of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAnother method for the introduction of an electrode is illustrated by\r\n_d_, _e_, _f_ and _g_, Fig. 11. In this case the bulb or thin-walled\r\ntube into which the electrode is to be sealed is perforated by a quick\r\nstab with an intensely heated wire--preferably of platinum--which is\r\nthen withdrawn before the glass has had time to harden, and thus a\r\nminute circular hole is made. The electrode is coated with a layer of\r\nsimilar glass, or of the specially made enamel which is sold for this\r\npurpose, inserted into the bulb or tube by any convenient opening, and\r\nadjusted by careful shaking until the platinum wire projects through the\r\nsmall hole. The bulb or tube is then fused to the coating of the\r\nelectrode and the whole spot expanded slightly by blowing. The\r\nappearance of the finished seal is shown by _g_. It is well to anneal\r\nslightly by smoking.\r\n\r\n_Thermometers._--Apart from the notes on page 20 with respect to the\r\nblowing of a suitable bulb on capillary tubing there is little to say in\r\nconnection with the glass working needed in making a plain thermometer.\r\nThe size desirable for the bulb will be determined by the bore of the\r\ncapillary tube, the coefficient of expansion of the liquid used for\r\nfilling, and the range of temperature for which the thermometer is\r\nintended.\r\n\r\nFilling may be carried out as follows:--Fit a small funnel to the open\r\nend of the capillary by means of a rubber tube, and pour into the funnel\r\nrather more than enough of the liquid to be used than is required to\r\nfill the bulb. Mercury or alcohol will be used in practice, most\r\nprobably. Warm the bulb until a few air bubbles have escaped through\r\nthe liquid and then allow to cool. This will suck a certain amount of\r\nliquid into the bulb. Now heat the bulb again, and at the same time heat\r\nthe capillary tube over a second burner. The liquid will boil and sweep\r\nout the residual air, but it is necessary to heat the capillary tube as\r\nwell in order to prevent condensation. Allow the bulb and tube to cool,\r\nthen repeat the heating once more. By this time the bulb and tube should\r\nbe free from air, and cooling should give a completely filled\r\nthermometer. Remove the funnel and heat the thermometer to a few degrees\r\nabove the maximum temperature for which it is to be used; the mercury or\r\nother filling liquid will overflow from the top, and, as the temperature\r\nfalls, will recede, thus allowing the end of the capillary to be drawn\r\nout. Reheat again until the liquid rises to the top of the tube, then\r\nseal by means of the blowpipe flame. The thermometer is now finished\r\nexcept for graduation; this is dealt with on page 75.\r\n\r\n_An Alarm Thermometer._--A thermometer which will complete an electric\r\ncircuit when a certain temperature is reached may be made by sealing an\r\nelectrode in the bulb and introducing a wire into the top, which in this\r\ncase is not sealed. Naturally, this thermometer will be filled with\r\nmercury. There is considerable difficulty in filling such a bulb without\r\ncausing it to crack.\r\n\r\nSeveral elaborations of this form are made, in which electrodes are\r\nsealed through the walls of the capillary tube, thus making it possible\r\nto detect electrically the variation of temperature when it exceeds any\r\ngiven limits.\r\n\r\n_An Enclosed or Floating Thermometer._--The construction of this type of\r\nthermometer is shown by _h_ and _i_, Fig 11. It is made in the following\r\nstages:--A bulb is blown on the drawn-out end of a thin-walled tube as\r\nshown by _h_. A small bulb is blown on the end of a capillary tube,\r\nburst, and turned out to form a lip which will rest in the drawn-out\r\npart of the thin-walled tube but is just too large to enter the bulb.\r\nThe capillary tube is introduced and sealed in position, care being\r\ntaken to expand the joint a little. The thermometer is filled and the\r\ntop of the capillary tube closed by the use of a small blowpipe flame. A\r\npaper scale having the necessary graduations is inserted, and the top\r\nof the outer tube is closed as shown by _i_.\r\n\r\n_A Maximum and Minimum Thermometer._--If a small dumb-bell-shaped rod of\r\nglass or metal is introduced into the capillary tube of a horizontally\r\nplaced, mercury-filled thermometer in such a position that the rising\r\nmercury column will come in contact with it, the rod will be pushed\r\nforward. When the mercury falls again the rod will be left behind and\r\nthus indicate the maximum temperature attained. If a similar\r\ndumb-bell-shaped rod is introduced into an alcohol-filled thermometer\r\nand pushed down until it is within the alcohol column, it will be drawn\r\ndown by surface tension as the column falls; but the rising column will\r\nflow passed it without causing any displacement; thus the minimum\r\ntemperature will be recorded.\r\n\r\nSix's combined maximum and minimum thermometer is shown by _b_, Fig. 11.\r\nIn this case both maximum and minimum records are obtained from a\r\nmercury column, although the thermometer bulb is filled with alcohol. It\r\nis an advantage to make the dumb-bell-shaped rods of iron, as the\r\nthermometer can then be reset by the use of a small magnet, another\r\nadvantage consequent on the use of metal being that the rods can be\r\neasily adjusted, by slight bending, so as to remain stationary in the\r\ntubes when the thermometer is hanging vertically, and yet to move with\r\nsufficient freedom to yield to the pressure of the recording column.\r\n\r\nThe thermometer may be filled by the following method:--When the\r\nstraight tube has been made the first dumb-bell is introduced and shaken\r\ndown well towards the lower bulb, the tube is now bent to its final\r\nshape and the whole thermometer filled with alcohol as described on page\r\n44. Now heat the thermometer to a little above the maximum temperature\r\nthat it is intended to record, and pour clean mercury into the open bulb\r\nwhile holding the thermometer vertically. Allow to cool, and the mercury\r\nwill be sucked down. The second dumb-bell is now introduced, sufficient\r\nalcohol being allowed to remain in the open bulb to about half fill it,\r\nand the alcohol in this bulb is boiled to expel air. The tube through\r\nwhich the bulb was filled in now sealed.\r\n\r\n_Clinical Thermometers._--The clinical thermometer is a maximum\r\nthermometer of a different type. In this case there is a constriction\r\nof the bore at a point just above the bulb. When the mercury in the bulb\r\ncommences to contract, the mercury column breaks at the constriction and\r\nremains stationary in the tube, thus showing the maximum temperature to\r\nwhich it has risen.\r\n\r\n_Vacuum Tubes._--There are so many forms of these that it is scarcely\r\npracticable or desirable to give detailed instructions for making them;\r\nbut an application of the various methods of glass-working which have\r\nalready been explained should enable the student to construct most of\r\nthe simpler varieties. An interesting vacuum tube is made which has no\r\nelectrodes, but contains a quantity of mercury. When the tube is rocked\r\nso as to cause friction between the mercury and the glass sufficient\r\ncharge is produced to cause the tube to glow.\r\n\r\n_A Sprengel Pump._--This, in its simplest form, is illustrated by _a_,\r\nFig. 12. Such a form, although highly satisfactory in action, needs\r\nconstant watching while in action, as should the mercury funnel become\r\nempty air will enter the exhausted vessel. Obviously, the fall-tube must\r\nbe made not less than thirty inches long; the measurement being taken\r\nfrom the junction of the exhaustion branch with the fall-tube to the top\r\nof the turned-up end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12]\r\n\r\n_A Macleod Pump._--One form of this is illustrated by _b_, Fig. 12. It\r\nhas the advantage that the mercury reservoir may be allowed to become\r\nempty without affecting the vacuum in the vessel being exhausted.\r\n\r\n_\"Spinning\" Glass._--By the use of suitable appliances, it is quite\r\npossible to draw out a continuous thread of glass, which is so thin as\r\nto have almost the flexibility and apparent softness of woollen fibre; a\r\nmass of such threads constitutes the \"glass wool\" of commerce.\r\n\r\nThe appliances necessary are:--a blowpipe capable of giving a\r\nwell-formed flame of about six or eight inches in length, a wheel of\r\nfrom eighteen inches to three feet in diameter and having a flat rim of\r\nabout three inches wide, and a device for rotating the wheel at a speed\r\nof about three hundred revolutions per minute.\r\n\r\nA very satisfactory arrangement may be made from an old bicycle; the\r\nback wheel having the tyre removed and a flat rim of tin fastened on in\r\nits place. The chain drive should be retained, but one of the cranks\r\nremoved and a handle substituted for the remaining pedal. The whole\r\ndevice is shown by Fig. 13.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13]\r\n\r\nThe procedure in \"spinning\" glass is as follows:--First melt the end of\r\na glass rod and obtain a large mass of thoroughly softened glass, now\r\nspin the wheel at such a speed that its own momentum will keep it\r\nspinning for several seconds. Touch the end of the melted rod with\r\nanother piece of glass and, without withdrawing the original rod from\r\nthe blowpipe flame, draw out a thread of molten glass and twist it round\r\nthe spinning wheel. If this is done properly, the thread of glass will\r\ngrip on the flat rim, and by continuing to turn the wheel by hand it is\r\npossible to draw out a continuous thread from the melted rod, which must\r\nbe advanced in the blowpipe flame as it is drawn on the wheel. If the\r\nrod is not advanced sufficiently the thread will melt off, if it is\r\nadvanced too much, so as to heat the thick part and allow the glass to\r\nbecome too cool at the point of drawing out, then the thread will become\r\ntoo thick, but it is easy after a little practice to obtain the right\r\nconditions. Practice is necessary also in order to find the right speed\r\nfor the wheel.\r\n\r\nWhen sufficient glass has been \"spun,\" the whole \"hank\" of thin thread\r\nmay be removed by drawing the thumb-nail across the wheel at any point\r\non its flat rim, thus breaking the threads, and allowing the \"hank\" to\r\nopen.\r\n\r\n_Brushes for Use with Strong Acids._--Glass wool, if of fine enough\r\ntexture to be highly flexible, can be used to make acid-resisting\r\nbrushes. A convenient method for mounting the spun glass is to melt the\r\nends of the threads together into a bead, and then to fuse the bead on\r\nto a rod; thus giving a brush. If a pointed brush is necessary, the\r\npoint may be ground on an ordinary grindstone or carborundum wheel by\r\npressing the loose end of the spun glass against the grinding wheel with\r\na thin piece of cardboard.\r\n\r\nWhen using brushes of this description, it is well to bear in mind the\r\nfact that there is always a liability of a few threads of glass breaking\r\noff during use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n     Glass, Its Composition and Characteristics. Annealing.\r\n     Drilling, Grinding, and Shaping Glass by methods other than\r\n     Fusion. Stopcocks. Marking Glass. Calibration and Graduation\r\n     of Apparatus. Thermometers. Exhaustion of Apparatus. Joining\r\n     Glass and Metal. Silvering Glass.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are three kinds of glass rod and tubing which are easily\r\nobtainable; these are soda-glass, which is that usually supplied by\r\nchemical apparatus dealers when no particular glass is specified;\r\ncombustion-glass, which is supplied for work requiring a glass that does\r\nnot so easily soften or fuse as soda-glass; and lead-glass, which is\r\nless common. There are also resistance-glass, made for use where very\r\nslight solubility in water or other solutions is desirable, and a number\r\nof other special glasses; but of these soda-glass, combustion-glass,\r\nlead-glass, and resistance-glass are the most important to the\r\nglass-blower whose work is connected with laboratory needs.\r\n\r\n_Soda-Glass._--Consists chiefly of sodium silicate, but contains\r\nsmaller quantities of aluminum silicate, and often of calcium silicate;\r\nthere may also be traces of several other compounds.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary soda-glass tubing melts easily in the blowpipe flame, it\r\nhas not a long intermediate or viscous stage during fusion, but becomes\r\nhighly fluid rather suddenly; it does not blacken in the reducing flame.\r\nBad soda-glass or that which has been kept for many years, tends to\r\ndevitrify when worked. That is to say the glass becomes more or less\r\ncrystalline and infusible while it is in the flame; and in this case it\r\nis often impossible to do good work with that particular sample of\r\nglass; although the devitrification may sometimes be remedied by heating\r\nthe devitrified glass to a higher temperature. The presence of aluminum\r\ncompounds appears to have some influence on the tendency of the glass to\r\nresist devitrification. Soda-glass, as a rule, is more liable to crack\r\nby sudden heating than lead-glass, and articles made from soda-glass\r\noften tend to crack spontaneously if badly made or, in the case of\r\nheavier and thicker articles, if insufficiently annealed.\r\n\r\n_Combustion-Glass._--Is usually a glass containing more calcium silicate\r\nand potassium silicate than the ordinary \"soft\" soda-glass. It is much\r\nless fusible than ordinary soda-glass, and passes through a longer\r\nintermediate or viscous stage when heated. Such a glass is not very\r\nsuitable for use with the blowpipe owing to the difficulty experienced\r\nin obtaining a sufficiently high temperature. If, however, a certain\r\namount of oxygen is mixed with the air used in producing the blowpipe\r\nflame this difficulty is minimised.\r\n\r\n_Resistance-Glass._--May contain zinc, magnesium, and other substances.\r\nAs a rule it is harder than ordinary soda-glass, and less suitable for\r\nworking in the blowpipe flame. It should have very little tendency to\r\ndissolve in water, and hence is used when traces of alkali or silicates\r\nwould prove injurious in the solutions for which the glass vessels are\r\nto be used.\r\n\r\n_Lead-Glass._--This, or \"flint\" glass as it is often called from the\r\nfact that silica in the form of crushed and calcined flint was often\r\nused in making the English lead-glasses, contains a considerable\r\nproportion of lead silicate. Such a glass has, usually, a particularly\r\nbright appearance, a high refractive index, and is specially suitable\r\nfor the production of the heavy \"cut-glass\" ware.\r\n\r\nLead-glass tubing is easy to work in the blowpipe flame, melts easily,\r\nbut does not become fluid quite so suddenly as most soda-glasses;\r\narticles made from it are remarkably stable and free from tendency to\r\nspontaneous cracking, although, as is essential for all the heavy or\r\n\"glass-house\" work, the massive articles need annealing in the oven.\r\n\r\nThe two chief disadvantages of lead-glass for laboratory work are that\r\nit is blackened by the reducing gases if held too near to the blue cone\r\nof the blowpipe flame, and that it is rather easily attacked by chemical\r\nreagents; thus ammonium sulphide will cause blackening.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the reducing flame on lead is not altogether a\r\ndisadvantage, however; because a little care in adjusting the blowpipe\r\nand a little care in holding the glass in the right position will enable\r\nthe student to work lead-glass without producing the faintest trace of\r\nblackening. This, in addition to being a valuable exercise in\r\nmanipulation, will teach him to keep his blowpipe in good order, and\r\nprove a useful aid in his early efforts to judge as to the condition of\r\nthe flame. It prevents discouragement if the student does his\r\npreliminary work with the soda-glass, but he should certainly make\r\nexperiments with lead-glass as soon as he has acquired reasonable\r\ndexterity with soda-glass.\r\n\r\n_Annealing._--Annealing is a process by which any condition of strain\r\nwhich has been set up in a glass article, either by rapid cooling of one\r\npart while another part still remains hot, or by the application of\r\nmechanical stress after cooling is relieved. Annealing is carried out by\r\nsubjecting the article to a temperature just below the softening point\r\nof the glass, maintaining that temperature until the whole article has\r\nbecome heated through the thicker part, and then reducing the\r\ntemperature very gradually; thus avoiding any marked cooling of the\r\nthinner and outer parts first.\r\n\r\nFor thin glass apparatus of the lamp-blown or blowpipe-made variety in\r\nwhich there are no marked difference of thickness, such as joins on\r\ntubes, ordinary seals, bulbs, etc., there is little need for annealing;\r\nand even those having rather marked changes of thickness, such as\r\nfilter pumps, can be annealed sufficiently by taking care that the last\r\nstep in making is heating to just below visible redness in the blowpipe\r\nflame and then rotating in a sooty gas flame until covered with a\r\ndeposit of carbon. The article should then be allowed to cool in a place\r\nfree from draughts and where the hot glass will not come in contact with\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nA few of the blowpipe-made articles, such, for example, as glass\r\nstopcocks, need more careful annealing, and for this purpose a small\r\nsheet-iron oven which can be heated to dull redness over a collection of\r\ngas burners will serve. Better still, a small clay muffle can be used.\r\nIn either case, the article to be annealed should be laid on a clean,\r\nsmooth, fireclay surface, the temperature should be maintained at a very\r\ndull red for two or three hours and then reduced steadily until the oven\r\nis cold. This cooling should take anything from three to twelve hours,\r\naccording to the nature of the article to be annealed. A thick article,\r\nor one having great irregularities in thickness will need much longer\r\nannealing than one thinner or more regular. As a rule, soda-glass will\r\nneed more annealing than lead-glass.\r\n\r\n_Drilling Glass._--Small holes may be drilled in glass by means of a rod\r\nof hard steel which has been broken off, thus giving a more or less\r\nirregular and crystalline end.\r\n\r\nThere are several conditions necessary to enable the drilling of small\r\nholes to be carried out successfully:--the first of these is that the\r\n\"drill\" should be driven at a high speed. This may be done by means of a\r\ngeared hand-drill such as the American pattern drill, although a\r\nsomewhat higher speed than this will give is even more satisfactory. The\r\nsecond condition is that the pressure on the drill is neither too light\r\nnor too heavy; this is conveniently regulated by hand. The third\r\ncondition is that the drill be prevented from \"straying\" over the\r\nsurface of the glass; for this purpose a small metal guide is useful.\r\nThe fourth condition is that a suitable lubricant be used; a strong\r\nsolution of camphor in oil of turpentine is perhaps the most suitable.\r\nFor commercial work, a diamond drill is often used, but this is scarcely\r\nnecessary for the occasional work of a laboratory.\r\n\r\n_Larger Holes in Glass._--The method of drilling with a hard steel rod\r\nis not highly satisfactory for anything but small holes. When a larger\r\nhole, say one of an eighth of an inch or more, is needed it is better to\r\nuse a copper or brass tube. This tube may be held in an American\r\nhand-drill, but a mixture of carborundum or emery and water is supplied\r\nto the rotating end. Tube or drill must be lifted at frequent intervals\r\nin order to allow a fresh supply of the grinding material to reach the\r\nend. In this case, also, a guide is quite essential in the early stages\r\nof drilling; otherwise the end of the tube will stray. The speed of\r\ncutting may be increased slightly by making a number of radial slots in\r\nthe end of the tube; these serve to hold a supply of the grinding\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\n_Grinding Lenses._--This is scarcely within the scope of a book on\r\nglass-blowing for laboratory purposes, but it may be said that the lens\r\nmay be ground by means of a permutating mould of hard lead or\r\ntype-metal. The rough shaping is done with coarse carborundum or emery,\r\nand successive stages are carried on with finer and finer material. The\r\nlast polishing is by the use of jewellers' rouge on the mould, now\r\nlined with a fine textile.\r\n\r\n_Filing Glass._--If a new file, thoroughly lubricated with a solution of\r\ncamphor in oil of turpentine, is used, there is but little difficulty in\r\nfiling the softer glasses. A slow movement of the file, without\r\nexcessive pressure but without allowing the file to slip, is desirable.\r\nAfter a time the cutting edges of the file teeth will wear down and it\r\nwill be necessary to replace the file by another.\r\n\r\n_Grinding Stoppers._--This is, perhaps, the most common form of grinding\r\nthat the laboratory worker will need to perform, and for that reason,\r\nrather full details of the procedure are desirable.\r\n\r\nA very crude form of ground-in stopper may be made by drawing out the\r\nneck and the mass of glass which is intended to form the stopper to\r\napproximately corresponding angles, wetting the surfaces with a mixture\r\nof the abrasive material and water, and grinding the stopper in by hand.\r\nFrequent lifting of the stopper is necessary during grinding, in order\r\nto allow fresh supplies of abrasive material to reach the contacts. When\r\nan approximate fit is obtained, the coarse abrasive should be washed\r\noff, care being taken that the washing is complete, and a finer abrasive\r\nsubstituted. After a while, this is replaced in its turn by a still\r\nfiner grinding material.\r\n\r\nSuch a method of grinding may give a satisfactory stoppering if the\r\nangles of the plug and socket correspond very closely before grinding is\r\ncommenced; but if there is a wide difference in the original angles,\r\nthen no amount of grinding by this method will produce a good result.\r\nThe reason for this is that the plug will become so worn in the\r\npreliminary grinding as to assume the form of a highly truncated cone;\r\nthe socket will assume a reverse form, and the end result will be a\r\nloose-fitting plug and socket.\r\n\r\nSatisfactory grinding may be carried out by the use of copper or\r\ntype-metal cones for the preliminary shaping. Such cones should be\r\nmounted on a mandrel which will fit into the chuck of the American\r\nhand-drill and turned on the lathe to the desirable angle for\r\nstoppering. A number of these cones will be necessary. A number of\r\nsimilar moulds, that is to say blocks of type-metal or hard lead in\r\nwhich is a hole corresponding in size and angle to the plug desired,\r\nshould be made also. These must be rotated, either in the lathe or by\r\nother means, and are used for the preliminary shaping of the plug. If\r\nbut few plugs are to be ground it is unnecessary to provide a means of\r\nrotating the moulds, as the plug may be held in the hand and ground into\r\nthe mould in a manner similar to that used in the first method of\r\nstoppering.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14]\r\n\r\nWhen the socket and plug have been ground, by the successive use of\r\ncones and moulds, to the desired angle, so that they correspond almost\r\nexactly, the plug is given its final fitting into the socket by\r\ngrinding-in with a fine abrasive, in the manner first described.\r\n\r\n_Stopcocks._--Although it would be more strictly in keeping with the\r\nform of this book to divide the making of stopcocks into two parts;\r\nshaping by heat and grinding, we will consider the whole operation here,\r\nand take for our example a simple stopcock such as that illustrated by\r\nFig. 14.\r\n\r\nThe \"blank,\" _f_, that is the socket before grinding, is made by drawing\r\nout a piece of fairly thick-walled tubing into the form shown by _a_.\r\nTwo zones on this tube are then heated by means of a small, pointed\r\nflame, and the tube is compressed along its axis, thus producing two\r\nraised rings as shown by _b_. Two zones, slightly towards the outer\r\nsides of these two raised rings are heated and the tube is drawn while\r\nair pressure is maintained within. This produces two thin-walled bulbs\r\nor extensions similar to those shown by _c_. One of these extensions is\r\nnow broken off by means of a sharp blow with the edge of a file or\r\nother piece of metal, and the edges of the broken glass are rounded in\r\nthe flame. The other extension is left to serve as a handle. We have now\r\na piece of glass like that shown by _d_. Now heat a spot on the side of\r\nthis, medially between the raised rings, until the glass is on the point\r\nof becoming deformed, and bring the intensely heated end of a smaller\r\ntube in contact with the heated spot. Without disturbing the relative\r\npositions of the two tubes, press the smaller tube down on a thin steel\r\nwire, so that the wire passes along the tube and enters the soft glass;\r\nthus forming a projection inside the sockets as shown by _e_. The wire\r\nmust be withdrawn, again immediately. When the wire has been withdrawn,\r\nheat the place where it entered to dull redness, in order to relieve any\r\nstrain; break off the thin extension, which up to the present has served\r\nas a handle, round off the broken edges in the flame, and join on and\r\nindent a similar piece of small tubing to the opposite side of the\r\nsocket; the socket at this stage being shown by _f_. The \"blank\" for the\r\nsocket is now completed, but it must be heated to dull redness in order\r\nto relieve strain and be placed in an annealing oven, where it should\r\nbe annealed for some hours.\r\n\r\nThe \"blank\" for the plug offers no special difficulty; it is made by\r\nheating a glass rod and compressing it axially until a mass having the\r\nform shown by _g_, Fig. 14, is produced; the end of this is heated\r\nintensely and brought in contact with the rather less heated side of a\r\nglass tube which has been drawn to the shape desired for the handle;\r\nwhen contact is made a slight air pressure is maintained in the glass\r\ntube, thus producing a hollow join. The ends of the tube are sealed and\r\nthe bottom of the plug is drawn off, thus giving the finished \"blank\" as\r\nshown by _h_. This blank is now held in a pair of asbestos-covered\r\ntongs, heated to dull redness all over, and transferred to the annealing\r\noven.\r\n\r\nWhen cold, the socket is ground out by the second method given under\r\n\"Grinding Stoppers\"; that is to say, by means of type-metal or copper\r\ncone, and the plug is ground to fit in a corresponding mould. When the\r\nfit is almost perfect, the transverse hole is drilled in the plug, and\r\nthe final finishing is made with fine abrasive powder. Great care must\r\nbe taken in the final grinding that there is no accumulation of\r\nabrasive material in the transverse hole of the plug; if this is allowed\r\nto occur there will be a ring ground out of the socket where the holes\r\nmove, and the tightness of the finished stopcock will be lost.\r\n\r\n_Marking Glass._--As a preliminary to a consideration of the methods of\r\ngraduating and calibrating glass apparatus, it is convenient to consider\r\nthe various methods which are available for marking glass. Among these\r\nare, the writing diamond, the carborundum or abrasive pencil, the\r\ncutting-wheel, and etching by means of hydrofluoric acid. Each produces\r\na different class of marking and each is worthy of independent\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n_The Writing Diamond._--This is the name given to a small irregular\r\nfragment of \"bort\" which is usually mounted in a thin brass rod. Such a\r\ndiamond, if properly selected, has none of the characteristics of a\r\ncutting diamond; although one occasionally finds so-called \"writing\r\ndiamonds\" which will produce a definite cut. These should be rejected.\r\n\r\nThe writing diamond is used in much the same way as a pencil, but is\r\nheld more perpendicularly to the object, and a certain amount of\r\npressure is necessary. The mark produced is a thin scratch which,\r\nalthough fairly definite, lacks breadth, and this is a disadvantage\r\nwhere the marking has to be read at a distance. This disadvantage may to\r\nsome extent be overcome by making a number of parallel scratches.\r\n\r\n_The Abrasive Pencil._--A rod of carborundum composition may be ground\r\nor filed to a point, and this forms a very useful pencil for general\r\nwork. The marking produced is rather less definite than that produced by\r\na writing diamond, but has the advantage of being broader.\r\n\r\n_The Cutting Wheel._--\"Cutting\" in this case is scarcely the ideal\r\nexpression, it should rather be \"grinding,\" but \"cutting\" is more\r\ncommonly used. Exceedingly good graduations may be made by the edge of a\r\nsmall, thin, abrasive wheel which is mounted on the end of a small\r\nmandrel and driven by a flexible shaft from an electric motor or any\r\nother convenient source of power. The depth of the mark can be\r\ncontrolled, and very light pressure will suffice.\r\n\r\n_Etching._--This is often the quickest and easiest way of marking glass\r\napparatus. The object to be marked should first be warmed and coated\r\nvery thoroughly with a thin film of paraffin wax. When cold, the marking\r\nis made through the paraffin wax by means of a needle point, and the\r\nobject is then exposed to the action of hydrofluoric acid. If a shallow\r\nbut clearly visible marking is desired, it is well to use the vapour of\r\nthe acid; this may be done by bending up a sheet-lead trough on which\r\nthe object can rest with the marked surface downwards. A little of the\r\ncommercial hydrofluoric acid, or a mixture of a fluoride and sulphuric\r\nacid, is distributed over the bottom of the trough, and the whole\r\narrangement is allowed to stand for about an hour. The object is washed\r\nthoroughly and the paraffin wax removed, either by melting and wiping\r\noff or by the use of a solvent, and the marking is finished.\r\n\r\nIf a deep marking is desired, in order that it may afterwards be filled\r\nwith some pigment, a better result is obtained by the use of liquid\r\ncommercial hydrofluoric acid, which is a solution of hydrogen fluoride\r\nin water. The acid is mopped on to the object after the markings have\r\nbeen made on the paraffin wax film, and allowed to remain in contact for\r\na few minutes. It is advantageous to repeat the mopping-on process at\r\nintervals during the etching.\r\n\r\nIn all cases where hydrofluoric acid is used, or stored, it is of great\r\nimportance to keep it well away from any optical instruments, as the\r\nmost minute trace of vapour in the air will produce a highly destructive\r\ncorrosion of any glass surfaces.\r\n\r\n_Methods of Calibration._--In the case of apparatus for volumetric work,\r\nthis is usually carried out by weighing, although some of the smaller\r\nsubdivisions are often made by measurement. When the subdivisions are\r\nmade in this way it is of importance to see that the walls of the tube\r\nor vessel to be calibrated are parallel. Great errors arise in some of\r\nthe commercial apparatus from neglect of this precaution. A convenient\r\nmethod of testing for parallelism, in the case of a wide tube, is to\r\nclose one end and to weigh in successive quantities of mercury. An\r\nobservation of the length occupied by each successive quantity will\r\nindicate any change in the bore. In the case of capillary tubes, it is\r\nconvenient to introduce an unweighed quantity of mercury, measure its\r\nlength accurately, and then to move it along the tube in stages, either\r\nby tilting the tube or by the application of air pressure. A measurement\r\nof the length at each stage will indicate whether the bore is\r\napproximately parallel or not. Neither of these methods is to be relied\r\non without a careful examination of the tube, as it may happen that\r\nthere are local irregularities in the bore which compensate for each\r\nother, and do not, therefore, affect the volume of a given length.\r\nObviously, the smaller the quantity of mercury with which the test is\r\ncarried out and the greater the number of observations made, the less\r\nrisk will there be of such an error. A liquid, such as water or alcohol,\r\nwhich wets the glass is not suitable for such a test, unless special\r\nprecautions are taken.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, a pipette or burette has to be calibrated to deliver a\r\ncertain volume of water, the final calibration must be made with this\r\nliquid. Thus, the burette would first be calibrated by weighing in\r\ndefinite quantities of mercury of say 13.54 grammes (1 cc at 15°C.),\r\neach of the 1 cc divisions should be marked by some temporary marking.\r\nThe burette is now filled with a solution of potassium bichromate and\r\nsulphuric acid and allowed to soak for some time; the bichromate is\r\nwashed out and distilled water is put in. Successive quantities of water\r\nare run out of the jet, a fixed time being allowed for draining, and the\r\nweights of the quantities delivered are noted. This procedure will give\r\nthe necessary data for altering the marking so that it may correspond to\r\n1 cc _delivered_. Each 1 cc division is now divided into tenths by the\r\nmethod described below. A final verification of the markings should be\r\nmade when the subdivision is completed.\r\n\r\n_Subdivision of Graduations._--Mark out the spaces to be subdivided on a\r\nsheet of paper. Take a reliable ruler on which any convenient length is\r\ndivided into the desired number and place it across the lines at such an\r\nangle that the limits noted on the rule exactly bridge the gap. Now draw\r\nparallel lines through the markings.\r\n\r\n_Copying a Scale._--When a scale has been prepared on paper and it is\r\nnecessary to copy that scale on the waxed-glass surface for etching, a\r\nconvenient method is to employ a long wooden bar having a sharp needle\r\npassing through it at either end. The scale and object to be marked are\r\nfastened in line with one another, and the caliper bar is used from step\r\nto step. The mark is made by moving the bar through a minute portion of\r\na circle, which provided that the bar is two or three feet in length,\r\nwill not introduce any perceptible error in a scale of say a quarter of\r\nan inch in width. The arrangement is shown by Fig. 15.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15]\r\n\r\n_Graduating a Thermometer._--Assuming that the thermometer has been made\r\nof carefully selected tubing in which the bore is parallel and free from\r\nany small irregularities, we have only to fix the freezing point and\r\nboiling point. The intervening space may then be divided into 100 (if\r\nthe thermometer is to be Centigrade) or 180 (if Fahrenheit). This\r\ndivision may be carried out by the method given under \"Subdivisions of\r\nGraduations.\" A thermometer should not be calibrated until some weeks\r\nafter making, as the glass bulb tends to contract.\r\n\r\n_Joining Glass and Metal._--It sometimes happens that one needs to make\r\na more permanent and less flexible joint between a glass and metal tube\r\nthan can be obtained by means of a rubber tube. To this end, any one of\r\nthree slightly different methods may be employed. In the method of\r\nChatelier one first coats the glass with platinum or silver, which may\r\nbe done by moistening the glass with platinum chloride or silver nitrate\r\nand then heating to redness; a layer of copper is then deposited\r\nelectrolytically on the treated surface of the glass, and soldering is\r\ncarried out in the usual manner.\r\n\r\nMcKelvy and Taylor call attention to two other methods in the _Journal\r\nof the Chemical Society_ for September, 1920. In one of these methods\r\nthe glass is coated with platinum by covering it with a suspension of\r\nplatinum chloride in oil of lavender and heating until the oil is burnt\r\noff. The metal tube is then tinned on its inner side and soldered to the\r\nprepared glass, slightly acid zinc chloride being used as a flux.\r\n\r\nIn the second method, a joint is made by means of the Kraus flux, which\r\nconsists of equal weights of zinc oxide, borax, and powdered soda-glass\r\nfused together. This is coated on the inner surface of the metal tube,\r\nand the hot glass tube, which has had the end slightly flanged to give\r\nsupport, is inserted. Fusion of the flux is completed by heating the\r\noutside of metal tube.\r\n\r\n_Silvering Glass._--In all cases where it is intended to deposit a\r\nsilver mirror on a glass surface, thorough cleaning is essential.\r\nProlonged soaking in a hot solution of potassium bichromate which has\r\nbeen acidified with sulphuric acid will often prove useful. The glass\r\nshould then be washed thoroughly, rinsed in distilled water, and the\r\nsolution should then be used.\r\n\r\nThere are many formulæ for the silvering solution, but that used in\r\nMartin's method may be given:--\r\n\r\n        A--Nitrate of Silver      40 grammes\r\n           Distilled Water      1000 c. cm.\r\n\r\n        B--Nitrate of Ammonium    60 grammes\r\n           Distilled Water      1000 c. cm.\r\n\r\n        C--Pure Caustic Potash   100 grammes\r\n           Distilled Water      1000 c. cm.\r\n\r\n        D--Pure Sugar Candy      100 grammes\r\n           Distilled Water      1000 c. cm.\r\n\r\n     Dissolve and add:--\r\n\r\n           Tartaric Acid          23 grammes\r\n\r\n     Boil for ten minutes, and when cool add:--\r\n\r\n           Alcohol               200 c. cm.\r\n           Distilled Water to   2000 c. cm.\r\n\r\nFor use take equal parts of A and B. Mix together also equal parts of C\r\nand D in another vessel. Then mix both liquids together in the silvering\r\nvessel and suspend the glass to be silvered face downwards in the\r\nsolution. Or if a vessel has to be silvered on the inside, the solution\r\nis poured in. In this case, the deposition of silver may be hastened by\r\nimmersing the vessel to be silvered in warm water.\r\n\r\nIn working with a silver solution containing ammonia or ammonium salts\r\nthere is sometimes the possibility of forming an explosive silver\r\ncompound. It is well, therefore, to avoid keeping such solutions longer\r\nthan is necessary, and to bear in mind that any deposit formed by\r\nsolutions containing both silver and ammonia may have explosive\r\nproperties, especially when dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n     Extemporised Glass-Blowing Apparatus--The Use of Oil or\r\n     other Fuels--Making Small Rods and Tubes from Glass\r\n     Scrap--The Examination of Manufactured Apparatus with the\r\n     View to Discovering the Methods Used in Manufacture--Summary\r\n     of Conditions Necessary for Successful Glass-Blowing.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf, in the early stages of his study of glass-blowing, the student\r\nshould attempt to work with the very simplest appliances, it is probable\r\nthat his progress will be hindered; the use of the apparatus will\r\nrequire an undue amount of care and his attention will be distracted\r\nfrom the actual manipulation of the glass. The case is widely different\r\nafter he has acquired a certain facility in glass-blowing.\r\n\r\n_A Simple Form of Blowpipe._--Although there are even more simple forms\r\nthan that described here, we are not concerned with them. The form\r\ndescribed is the simplest with which any considerable amount of\r\nglass-blowing can be carried out with certainty.\r\n\r\nThis form consists of a tube through which air may be blown with the\r\nmouth, a condensation chamber in which any moisture from the breath can\r\ncondense, a blowpipe jet, a supporting piece and a source of flame.\r\n\r\nThe tube, condensation chamber, and jet are combined in the ordinary\r\nBlack's blowpipe, such as is used for blowpipe tests in qualitative\r\nanalysis; it consists of a conical tin tube having a mouthpiece at the\r\nsmall end and a side tube which carries a brass jet. A support for such\r\na blowpipe may be cut out of a piece of brass or tin-plate, and should\r\nbe fastened to a small, flat, wooden board. A source of flame may\r\nconsist of an ordinary brass elbow, such as is used on gas fittings, and\r\ninto which a piece of thin brass tube (the body of a fish-tail burner\r\nfrom which the perforated non-metallic plug has been removed will serve\r\nquite well) has been fitted. It is an advantage to flatten the brass\r\ntube somewhat and to file the flattened end to a slope which corresponds\r\nwith the angle at which the blowpipe jet enters the burner. The whole\r\nsource of the flame should be mounted on a separate base, in order that\r\nit may be moved while adjusting the apparatus to the best relative\r\npositions of flame and blowpipe jet. The complete apparatus is shown by\r\n_a_, Fig. 16.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16]\r\n\r\nIn order to take full advantage of this blowpipe, it is desirable that\r\nthe student should learn to maintain a steady steam of air with his\r\nmouth and, at the same time, be able to breathe. This requires a little\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nAs a first exercise in breathing, before trying to breathe while using\r\nthe mouth blowpipe, the student should close his mouth and inflate his\r\ncheeks with air; now, still keeping his cheeks tightly inflated, he\r\nshould attempt to breathe through the nose. At first, this may be found\r\nrather difficult, but it becomes remarkably easy after a little\r\npractice. When he has mastered this, the student may practise the same\r\noperation, but with the blowpipe. It is important to bear in mind that\r\nthe cheeks, not the lungs, form the reservoir for air used in\r\nmaintaining the blowpipe flame. After a while, the student will find\r\nthat he can maintain a steady air pressure and yet breathe with complete\r\ncomfort.\r\n\r\nIn adjusting the flame, care should be taken not to blow so hard as to\r\nproduce a ragged and noisy cone of fire. A small jet, such as that\r\ncommonly used on a mouth blowpipe, will with care give a pointed and\r\nquiet flame, having an appearance similar to that shown in the\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nWith a blowpipe like this, it is quite easy to seal glass tubes up to an\r\ninch in diameter, to join tubes up to half an inch in diameter, to bend\r\ntubes, to blow small bulbs, and to make the simpler forms of internal\r\nseal; but the provision for condensation of moisture is not ideal, and\r\nprolonged use of such a blowpipe also tends to produce undue fatigue.\r\n\r\n_A Mouth Blowpipe With an Expanding Reservoir._--This form of blowpipe\r\ncan be made to give most excellent results; it is highly portable, and\r\ndoes not produce nearly so much fatigue when used continuously as the\r\nblowpipe described in the last section. Various slight modifications\r\nhave been made in its construction during the last eighty years, but\r\nthat described below will be found quite satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus consists of a tube through which air is blown from the\r\nmouth, a valve through which the air passes into an expanding reservoir,\r\nand a blowpipe jet in communication with the reservoir.\r\n\r\nIn making the valve, several essentials have to be remembered; it must\r\nallow a free passage of air into the reservoir, it must open easily, and\r\nmust close quickly. A satisfactory form of valve is that shown by _b_,\r\nFig. 16. The moving part consists of a light glass bulb of about\r\nthree-eights of an inch diameter and having a glass stem of rather under\r\none-eighth diameter and about an inch and a half long. This stem rests\r\nin a guide at the end of a brass tube, the bulb contacting against the\r\nother end which is approximately shaped. The bulb and its seating are\r\nground air-tight. A very light spring holds the bulb in position.\r\n\r\nThis valve is fitted into a metal or glass T piece, one limb of which\r\nleads to the air reservoir and the other limb leads to the blowpipe jet;\r\nthe limb containing the valve leads to the tube through which the air is\r\nblown in.\r\n\r\nA convenient reservoir may be made from a fairly large football bladder.\r\nA network of string should be fitted over the outside of the bladder and\r\nthe strings should terminate in a hook on which a weight can be hung, in\r\norder to provide a means of adjusting the pressure at which the air is\r\ndelivered to the jet. This bladder should be washed out and allowed to\r\ndrain after use.\r\n\r\nThe air tube which passes from the valve to the mouth may conveniently\r\nbe made of brass, but, in order to avoid the continued contact of metal\r\nwith the lips of the operator, it should be fitted with a non-metallic\r\nmouthpiece. It is an advantage from the point of view of portability to\r\nhave the air tube easily detachable from the T piece containing the\r\nvalve.\r\n\r\nThe blowpipe jets, of which there may be several with advantage, may be\r\nmade of glass tubing, bent to the most convenient angle and having an\r\nenlargement or bulb at some point in the tube. This bulb serves as a\r\nfinal condensing place for any traces of moisture that may escape from\r\nthe larger reservoir.\r\n\r\nThe whole device, blowing tube, reservoir, and T piece may be fastened\r\nto a clamp, so that it can be secured on the edge of any table where\r\nblowpipe work is to be carried out. If the blowpipe is to be used with\r\ngas, the form of burner described under. \"A Simple Form of Blowpipe\"\r\nwill be found quite satisfactory.\r\n\r\n_The Use of Oil, or Other Non-Gaseous Fuels._--Although gas, when\r\navailable, is usually preferred on account of its convenience, there are\r\nseveral other fuels which give a hotter flame. They have, also, the\r\nadditional advantage of not requiring any connecting pipes; but each has\r\nits own disadvantage.\r\n\r\nOne liquid fuel deserves special mention as being rather less desirable\r\nthan the others; this is alcohol. Although very convenient in use, it\r\nhas the disadvantage of being rather too highly inflammable and capable\r\nof burning without a wick, thus involving a certain fire risk; the flame\r\nis scarcely visible in a bright light, and the heat given by either the\r\nordinary flame or the blowpipe flame produced from alcohol is\r\nconsiderably less than that from a similar flame in which coal gas is\r\nused. For small work, however, the facility with which a spirit lamp may\r\nbe lighted may more than counterbalance these disadvantages at times.\r\n\r\n_Paraffin Wax._--Where there is no coal gas available and the blowpipe\r\nis only required at intervals, and especially where high portability is\r\nrequired, there are few fuels so convenient as paraffin wax. This may be\r\nobtained in pieces of a satisfactory size by cutting paraffin candles,\r\nfrom which the wick has been withdrawn, into lengths of about half an\r\ninch. These cut pieces have the advantage over any oily fuel, such as\r\ncolza oil, that they can be wrapped in paper or carried in a cardboard\r\nbox; further they will keep indefinitely, even in the presence of air,\r\nwithout undergoing any perceptible change.\r\n\r\n_Forms of Lamp for Paraffin Wax._--Probably, the best form is that\r\ndevised by Thomas Bolas, and described by him in the _Journal of the\r\nSociety of Arts_, December 2nd, 1898. This lamp consists of a small open\r\ntray of iron, through which pass three or more flat tubes, and between\r\nthese tubes are placed small flat pieces of wick, the fit being such\r\nthat the pieces of wick may be adjusted easily by means of a pair of\r\npointed tweezers.\r\n\r\nThe flame thus obtained, instead of having one large hollow, is broken\r\nor divided so that the combustion is concentrated into a smaller area,\r\nand the air blast, which is directed across the flame, carries the flame\r\nwith it in a more complete manner than is the case with the ordinary\r\nflame; a more thorough combustion being realised by this arrangement.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage is the ease with which the wick may be changed and a\r\nlarger or smaller wick inserted to suit the flame to any size of air\r\njet.\r\n\r\nThis form of lamp may be used for oily fuel, although it is specially\r\nsuitable for paraffin wax.\r\n\r\nTwo small pieces of bent tin-plate may be used as side covers, and these\r\nserve to adjust the flame within certain limits. A tin-plate cover which\r\nfits easily over the whole lamp serves as an extinguisher. The complete\r\nlamp is shown by _d_, Fig. 16, and this figure shows also a quick-change\r\nair-jet device, the whole arrangement forming a blowpipe for use where a\r\nnon-gaseous fuel is to be employed.\r\n\r\nAlthough the lamp just described is desirable when complete control over\r\nthe size of the flame is necessary, and if the ideal conditions and\r\nmaximum heat are to be obtained, yet a simpler form of lamp will be\r\nfound to give very good results. Such a lamp may consist of a flat tin\r\ntray, having a diameter of about three and a half inches and a depth of\r\nabout one inch. In this tray is a tin support for the wick, and the wick\r\nitself may consist of a bundle of soft cotton, for example, a loosely\r\nrolled piece of cotton cloth, but in either case the top of the wick\r\nshould be cut to approximately the same angle as that at which the\r\nblowpipe jet meets the flame.\r\n\r\nIn using paraffin wax as a fuel, it is necessary to see that sufficient\r\nwax reaches the wick to prevent charring during the first few minutes\r\nbefore the bulk of the wax is melted.\r\n\r\n_Animal and Vegetable Oils._--Almost any oil may be used as a fuel, but\r\nmany tend to become hard and gummy if allowed to stand in the air for\r\nany considerable time. When this happens, the wick becomes clogged and\r\nit is impossible to obtain a good flame. A number of the oils tend,\r\nalso, to produce rather strongly smelling smoke.\r\n\r\n_A Flame-Guard for Use With Non-Gaseous Fuels._--In order to avoid the\r\neye-strain produced by the luminous base of the flame from a wick\r\nburning paraffin wax or oil, it is often advantageous to make a small\r\ntunnel of tin-plate, which can be rested on the sides of the lamp and\r\nrises over the top of the wick. Such a flame guard is shown by _e_, Fig.\r\n16.\r\n\r\n_Small Rods and Tubes from Glass Scrap_:--It is scarcely practicable to\r\nmake small quantities of good glass with the blowpipe flame as the only\r\nsource of heat, but it is less difficult to make small rods or tubes\r\nfrom glass scrap, and the ability to do this is sometimes of\r\nconsiderable value when a small tube has to be joined on to some special\r\npiece of apparatus made of glass of unknown composition. It may be\r\npossible to obtain some fragments of similar glass, either from a broken\r\npart of the apparatus or from a similar piece, and from these fragments\r\nsmall tubes or rods can be made.\r\n\r\nThe fragments of glass may be melted together on the end of a clay\r\npipe-stem, care being taken to avoid trapping air bubbles as fresh\r\nfragments are added to the molten mass. When a sufficient quantity of\r\nglass has been accumulated, the viscous mass may be drawn out into a rod\r\nby bringing another pipe-stem into contact with the hot mass, rotating\r\nboth pipe-stems steadily, and separating them until a rod of the desired\r\nsize has been obtained.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, it is desired to produce a tube from the mass of\r\nheated glass, the mass should be blown hollow before the pipe-stems\r\nsupporting it are separated.\r\n\r\n_Methods of Manufacture._--When the student has familiarised himself\r\nwith the more common operations and processes used in glass-blowing, he\r\nwill be in a position to increase his skill and knowledge of special\r\nmethods by a critical examination of various examples of commercial\r\nwork. There are few exercises more valuable than such an examination,\r\ncombined with an attempt to reconstruct the stages and the methods by\r\nwhich the article chosen for examination was made.\r\n\r\nObviously, it is impossible to give full details of all constructions in\r\na small text-book; but it is easy to give an example of the\r\nconstructional methods employed in the making of almost any piece of\r\nlight blown-glass apparatus, and these methods should prove of special\r\nvalue when apparatus of a new pattern has to be evolved for the purposes\r\nof research. That is to say, one designs the apparatus required, applies\r\nknown methods of construction as far as possible, and, by the\r\nexamination of commercial apparatus having similar features, evolves the\r\nnew methods required. For an exercise in such a process of\r\nreconstruction we may well take an ordinary commercial vacuum tube, such\r\nas that shown by _a_, Fig. 17.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17]\r\n\r\nIn the tube from which this drawing was made, it was found that the\r\nspiral in the middle bulb was of a slightly yellowish colour and gave a\r\ngreen fluorescence when the electric discharge was passed through the\r\ntube; that is to say, the spiral is made of uranium-glass, which is\r\nusually a soda-glass containing trace of uranium, and hence differing\r\nslightly in composition from the ordinary glasses. The two enclosed\r\ntubes which are bent into a series of S bends gave a pink fluorescence,\r\nwhich indicates lead-glass; and the remainder of the tube fluoresced\r\nwith an apple-green colour; this suggests ordinary soda-glass. We have,\r\ntherefore, a piece of apparatus in which three dissimilar glasses are\r\njoined, while, at the same time, that apparatus contains a number of\r\ninternal seals, and it is not probable that the dissimilar glasses will\r\nhave their coefficients of expansion so nearly alike as to permit of a\r\nstable internal seal being made if one part of the seal consists of a\r\nglass differing from that of the other part.\r\n\r\nThese considerations lead us to a closer examination of the joins where\r\nthe dissimilar glasses are introduced, and we find that in no case is\r\nthe internal seal made between dissimilar glasses, but that a soda-glass\r\nextension is joined on to both the uranium-glass tube and the lead-glass\r\ntubes at a point about half an inch before the internal seal commences.\r\nCareful examination of these joins shows that the change from one glass\r\nto another is not abrupt but gradual. Such a transitional joint may be\r\nmade by taking a length of soda-glass tubing, sealing the end and fusing\r\na minute bead of the other glass on to the sealed end, the end is then\r\nexpanded and another bead of the other glass added, this bead is\r\nexpanded and the operation is repeated, thus building up a tube, and,\r\nfinally, the tube of the other glass is joined on to the end of this.\r\n\r\nWe are now concerned with the question of the insertion of the\r\nuranium-glass spiral into the bulb (see p. 38). Obviously the spiral is\r\ntoo large to pass through the necks of the bulb, and it is difficult to\r\nimagine that the spiral was obtained by the insertion of a length of\r\nstraight tubing which was bent after entering the bulb; therefore, the\r\nonly remaining method is that the spiral was made first and the\r\nsoda-glass extensions fastened on, and that the bulb was blown, cut in\r\nhalves and the spiral inserted, and the two halves were then rejoined.\r\nThat this was actually the case is confirmed by traces of a join which\r\nare just visible round the middle of the bulb. The insertion of the\r\nspiral and the making of the first internal seal are shown by _b_, and\r\n_c_.\r\n\r\nThere is one detail in making the second join of the spiral to the bulb\r\nwhich calls for attention, and the small branch, similar to an\r\nexhaustion branch, at the side of the bulb provides a clue to this. If\r\nan attempt were made to complete the second internal seal through a\r\nclosed bulb it would be impossible to obtain a good result, as the\r\nair-pressure in the bulb would not be under control when once union was\r\neffected, and further heating of the air in the bulb would cause\r\nexpansion and perforate the wall near the second internal seal; we\r\ntherefore make a small branch which can be left open and through which\r\nsuch air-pressure as may be found necessary can be maintained.\r\n\r\nThe third join, by which the lead-glass tube is joined to the soda-glass\r\nis made in stages similar to those in which the soda-glass and\r\nuranium-glass were joined; but the internal seal is most conveniently\r\nmade by sliding a length of tubing over the lead-glass and fusing this\r\ntubing to the large diameter soda-glass tube to which the lead-glass is\r\nalready joined. The first stage of this operation is illustrated by _d_.\r\nWhen this seal is completed, the end of the soda-glass tube is drawn off\r\nand sealed as shown in _e_, and at this stage a side tube or branch is\r\njoined on. The sealed end of the outer and large diameter soda-glass\r\ntube is heated until it contracts and fuses to the enlargement that has\r\npreviously been joined to the lead-glass tube, and the end is burst out\r\nas shown in _f_. Another length of soda-glass is then joined on to the\r\nburst-out end, and this length of soda-glass tubing is drawn out to a\r\nthin-walled contraction; the non-contracted part is expanded to form the\r\nbulb, and a small exhaustion branch made on the side, the drawn-out\r\nportion being cut off, and an electrode, previously prepared by coating\r\na part of its length with a suitable enamel, is introduced. The tube is\r\ntilted to keep the electrode away from the drawn-out end, which is\r\nmelted off and sealed. A small perforation is made with a hot platinum\r\nor iron wire in the sealed end, the electrode is shaken into position,\r\nand the sealing is completed as explained on page 42.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the tube, that is to say the lead-glass tube and the\r\nbulb on the other side of the middle bulb, is completed in a similar\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR SUCCESS IN GLASS-BLOWING.\r\n\r\nFor the convenience of the student, it may be well to summarise the\r\nchief essentials for success in glass-blowing, and at the same time to\r\nadd such brief notes on the various methods as may seem desirable.\r\n\r\n_Adjustment of Blowpipe._--The air jet should be clean internally, and\r\nso centered as to give a flame having a well-defined blue portion, the\r\ntip of the flame should not be only slightly luminous but purple in\r\ncolour. In the case of a blowpipe burning oil or wax fuel the flame may\r\nbe a trifle more ragged without disadvantage.\r\n\r\n_Bellows and Blowing._--The bellows should be adjusted to deliver air at\r\nconstant pressure, either by insertion of a tap or, better, by attention\r\nto the wind reservoir if necessary. The movement of the foot in blowing\r\nshould be steady, not jerky.\r\n\r\n_Heating Glass._--The tube or rod should be heated cautiously until it\r\nhas reached its softening point in its thickest part. Steady rotation of\r\nthe glass during the heating is almost essential.\r\n\r\n_Blowing a Bulb or Expanding a Join._--Prolonged heating is necessary in\r\norder that the thick parts may be heated completely through. Blowing\r\nshould take place by stages, in order that the thin parts, which tend\r\nto expand first, have time to cool. The thick parts can then be expanded\r\nby further blowing and thus a bulb or expansion of even thickness can be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n_Cutting Glass._--The most useful method for general use is by means of\r\nthe file or glass-blowers' knife. Either file or knife must be kept\r\nsharp by grinding. Neither file nor knife should be used on hot glass.\r\nThe diamond and wheel cutter are useful for cutting sheet-glass, and\r\nwhen the diamond is employed a singing noise is an indication of a\r\nsatisfactory cut.\r\n\r\n_Leading a Crack._--A crack may be led in any desired direction by means\r\nof a bead of hot glass or a small gas flame. The glass which it is\r\ndesired to crack should be heated at a point slightly in advance of the\r\ncrack, which will extend in the direction of the source of the heat.\r\n\r\n_Turning Out the End of a Tube._--This is done by heating the end of the\r\ntube and rotating it against an iron rod. The rod must be kept polished\r\nand free from rust, and it must not be allowed to become too hot while\r\nin use, otherwise the glass will stick to it.\r\n\r\n_Joining Unlike Glasses._--Joints between unlike glasses are often\r\nunstable. When such joints are made it is desirable to blow them as thin\r\nas possible, and to avoid the junction of unlike glasses in any complex\r\njoint, such as an internal seal. A transitional portion of tubing may be\r\nbuilt up by the successive addition and interfusion of beads of one of\r\nthe glasses to the end of a sealed tube consisting of the other glass.\r\n\r\n_Joining a Tube to a Very Thin Bulb._--The bulb may be thickened at the\r\npoint of union by fusing on a bead of glass and expanding this slightly.\r\nA small central portion of the expanded part may then be perforated by\r\nbursting and the tube joined on.\r\n\r\n_Insertion of One Bulb Within Another._--A bulb may be divided into two\r\nhalves by leading a crack round it and the inner bulb is then\r\nintroduced. The two halves of the outer bulb may be fitted together\r\n(care being taken to avoid any damage to the edges), and the bulb may be\r\ncompleted by rotating the contacting edges before the blowpipe until\r\nthey are soft, and then expanding slightly by means of air-pressure.\r\n\r\n_Annealing._--For most purposes, in the case of thin, blowpipe-made or\r\nlamp-blown glass apparatus, it is sufficient to cool slowly by rotating\r\nthe finished article over a smoky flame and setting it aside in a place\r\nfree from draughts, and where the hot glass will not come in contact\r\nwith anything.\r\n\r\nSimple bulbs and joints do not even need this smoking; but thick\r\narticles, and especially those that are to be subjected to the stress of\r\ngrinding, need more prolonged annealing in a special oven.\r\n\r\n_Use of Lead-Glass._--When lead-glass is to be used, the blowpipe flame\r\nshould be in good adjustment and the glass should not be allowed to\r\napproach so near to the blue cone as to be blackened. Slight blackening\r\nmay often be removed by heating the glass in the extreme end of the\r\nflame.\r\n\r\nLead-glass articles tend to be rather more stable than similar articles\r\nof soda-glass.\r\n\r\n_Combustion-Glass._--This may be worked more easily if a small\r\npercentage of oxygen is introduced into the air with which the blowpipe\r\nflame is produced. If the air is replaced entirely by oxygen there is a\r\nrisk of damaging the blowpipe jet, unless a special blowpipe is\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\n_Internal Seal._--There are two ways of making these, one, in which the\r\ninner portion of the tube is fused on to the inside of the bulb or tube\r\nthrough which it is to pass, an opening is made by bursting and the\r\nouter tube is joined on. This is a quick and in some ways more\r\nsatisfactory method than the other, in which there is no separate inner\r\npiece.\r\n\r\n_Rubber Blowing Tube._--In complicated work it is often convenient to\r\nuse a thin rubber blowing-tube which is connected with the work either\r\nby a cork and piece of glass tubing or by fitting over a drawn-out end.\r\nThe use of such a blowing-tube avoids the inconvenience of raising the\r\nwork to the mouth when internal air-pressure is required. One end of the\r\nrubber tube is retained in the mouth during work.\r\n\r\n_General Notes._--A large amount of glass-blowing is spoiled through\r\ncarelessness in arranging the work beforehand. The student should have\r\nevery detail of his manipulation clearly in mind before he commences the\r\nwork; he should not trust to evolving the method during the actual\r\nmanipulation.\r\n\r\nUndue haste is another fruitful source of failure. Practically every\r\noperation in glass-blowing can be carried out in a perfectly leisurely\r\nmanner, and it is better to err rather on the side of deliberation than\r\non the side of haste.\r\n\r\nIf, as will doubtless happen at times, a piece of work gives trouble and\r\nit is necessary to pause and consider the whole question, or if for any\r\nother reason it is necessary to stop during the construction of a\r\npartially finished join or other operation, great care should be taken\r\nnot to allow the work to cool. A large, brush-like flame may be produced\r\nby increasing the amount of gas admitted to the blowpipe, and the work\r\nshould be held just in front of the current of hot air produced by such\r\na flame.\r\n\r\nIt will then be possible to continue work on this without causing it to\r\ncrack when further heat is applied.\r\n\r\nAs time goes on, the student will find an increasing confidence in his\r\nability to manipulate the soft glass, and with increasing confidence\r\nwill come rapidly increasing power of manipulation. Perhaps the greatest\r\nobstacle to success in glass-blowing is undue haste in manipulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAbsorption bulbs, 21, 23.\r\n\r\nAirtube, flexible, 8, 102.\r\n\r\nAlarm thermometer, 45.\r\n\r\nAnnealing, 7, 60.\r\n\r\n\r\nBellows, adjusting pressure of, 5, 6.\r\n\r\nBellows, foot, 5, 6.\r\n\r\nBending tubes, 23.\r\n\r\nBlackening, 58, 101.\r\n\r\nBranching, 18, 19.\r\n\r\nBrushes of spun glass, 53.\r\n\r\nBlowpipe flame, quality of, 3.\r\n\r\nBlowpipe for mouth blast, 80, 82, 84.\r\n\r\nBlowpipe, for paraffin wax, 82, 88.\r\n\r\nBlowpipe, Herepath's, 2.\r\n\r\nBlowpipe jet, centring, 3, 98.\r\n\r\nBlowpipe jet, dirt in, 3.\r\n\r\nBlowpipe jet, multiple, 4, 40.\r\n\r\nBlowpipe, Letcher's, change, 4.\r\n\r\nBlowpipe, simple form of, 80.\r\n\r\nBulb, medially on tube, 22.\r\n\r\nBulbs, 19, 20, 22, 38, 98.\r\n\r\nBulbs, absorption, (Liebig's), 21, 23.\r\n\r\nBulbs, dividing, 39, 95.\r\n\r\nBulbs from rod, 25.\r\n\r\nBulbs, internal, 38.\r\n\r\nBulbs, thick, 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nCages, from glass rod, 24, 25, 27.\r\n\r\nCalibration, 72.\r\n\r\nCarius tubes, 16.\r\n\r\nCondenser, Liebig's, 37.\r\n\r\nCondensers, various, 37, 38.\r\n\r\nCone, carbon, 8.\r\n\r\nCrack, leading, 30, 99.\r\n\r\nCracking, subversive, 103.\r\n\r\nCutting glass with diamond, 30.\r\n\r\nCutting tubes, 11, 99.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiamond (glazier's), use of, 30.\r\n\r\nDissimilar glass, joining of, 22, 94.\r\n\r\nDrilling, 61.\r\n\r\n\r\nElectrodes, sealing in, 42, 97.\r\n\r\nEtching glass, 70.\r\n\r\nExtemporised appliances, 80.\r\n\r\nExamination of apparatus, 93.\r\n\r\n\r\nFailure, Haste chief Source of, 103.\r\n\r\nFailures, Notes as to, 97.\r\n\r\nFile, with oblique ground edge, 7.\r\n\r\nFiling glass, 63.\r\n\r\nFilter pumps, 35\r\n\r\nFoot, 25\r\n\r\nFuels various, 82, 86, 87, 89.\r\n\r\nFunnel, thistle, 23.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral principles and precautions, 1, 97\r\n\r\nGlass, varieties of, 9, 55, 91-97.\r\n\r\nGraduation, 72-76\r\n\r\n\r\nHaste, Source of Failure, 103\r\n\r\nHeat reflector, asbestos, 7.\r\n\r\nHeating, intensive, 7, 57.\r\n\r\nHeating precautions, 12, 98\r\n\r\n\r\nJoining dissimilar glass, 22.\r\n\r\nJoining glass to metal, 76.\r\n\r\nJoining tubes, 16, 94, 100.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnife, Glass blower's, 7, 99.\r\n\r\n\r\nLenses, grinding, 63.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarking glass, 69.\r\n\r\nMethods, analytic study of, 91, 93.\r\n\r\n\r\nOxygen for intensive heating, 57, 101.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrecautions and General Principles, 1, 97.\r\n\r\nPumps, Filter, 35.\r\n\r\nPumps, Sprengel, 49, 50.\r\n\r\n\r\nRe-entering branch, 40.\r\n\r\nReflector of heat, asbestos, 7.\r\n\r\nRod, uses and articles from, 17, 25, 27, 28.\r\n\r\nRod, blowing to hollow, 17, 25, 26, 91.\r\n\r\n\r\nScrap glass, working, 90.\r\n\r\nSealing tubes, 12, 13, 14.\r\n\r\nSealed tubes for pressure, 15, 16.\r\n\r\nSealing in of Electrodes, 42, 97.\r\n\r\nSeals, internal (airtraps), 32, 102.\r\n\r\nSilvering glass, 77.\r\n\r\nSoldering glass, 76.\r\n\r\nSoxhlet-tube, 40.\r\n\r\nSpirals, 23, 95.\r\n\r\nSpray arrester, 34.\r\n\r\nSpray producers, 36.\r\n\r\nSprengel pumps, 49, 50.\r\n\r\nSpinning glass, 51.\r\n\r\nStopcocks, 60, 66.\r\n\r\nStoppering, 63.\r\n\r\nStirrers, 28, 29.\r\n\r\nSummary as to precautions and failures, 97.\r\n\r\n\r\nTaps, 60, 66.\r\n\r\nThermometers, Various, 44-49.\r\n\r\nThermo-regulator, 24.\r\n\r\nThistle Funnel, 23.\r\n\r\nTools, Various small, 7.\r\n\r\nTurn-pins, 7, 8, 99.\r\n\r\nTurning out open ends, 14, 99.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINTED IN GREAT BRITAIN BY\r\nW.
