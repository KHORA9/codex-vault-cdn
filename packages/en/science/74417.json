In these experiments, the reflecting plates were\r\nnecessarily inclined to each other during the operation of placing\r\ntheir surfaces in parallel planes; and I was therefore led to remark\r\nthe circular arrangement of the images of a candle round a centre,\r\nand the multiplication of the sectors formed by the extremities of\r\nthe plates of glass. In consequence, however, of the distance of the\r\ncandles, &c., from the ends of the reflectors, their arrangement was\r\nso destitute of symmetry, that I was not induced to give any farther\r\nattention to the subject.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of February 1815, when I discovered the development of the\r\ncomplementary colours, by the successive reflexions of polarized light\r\nbetween two plates of gold and silver, the effects of the Kaleidoscope,\r\nthough rudely exhibited, were again forced upon my notice; the\r\nmultiplied images were, however, coloured with the most splendid tints;\r\nand the whole effect, though inconceivably inferior to the creations\r\nof the Kaleidoscope, was still far superior to anything that I had\r\npreviously witnessed.\r\n\r\nIn giving an account of these experiments to M. Biot on the 6th of\r\nMarch 1815, I remarked to him, “that when the angle of incidence (on\r\nthe plates of silver) was about 85° or 86°, and the plates almost\r\nin contact, and inclined at a very small angle, the two series of\r\nreflected images appeared at once in the form of two curves; and that\r\nthe succession of splendid colours formed a phenomenon which I had no\r\ndoubt would be considered, by every person who saw it to advantage, as\r\none of the most beautiful in optics.” These experiments were afterwards\r\nrepeated with more perfectly polished plates of different metals, and\r\nthe effects were proportionally more brilliant: but notwithstanding\r\nthe beauty arising from the multiplication of the images, and the\r\nadditional splendour which was communicated to the picture by the\r\nrichness of the polarized tints, it was wholly destitute of symmetry,\r\nas I was then ignorant of those positions for the eye and the objects,\r\nwhich are absolutely necessary to produce that magical union of parts,\r\nand that mathematical symmetry throughout the whole picture, which,\r\nindependently of all colouring, give to the visions of the Kaleidoscope\r\nthe peculiar charm which distinguishes them from all artificial\r\ncreations.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] An account of the experiments above alluded to was given in\r\nthe _Analyse des Travaux de la Classe des Sciences Mathématiques\r\net Physiques de l’Institut Royal de France, pendant l’année 1815_,\r\npar M. le Chev. Delambre, p. 29, &c. The colours produced by\r\nrepeated reflexions from plates of silver are those of _Elliptical\r\nPolarization_, and are explained at great length in my paper on that\r\nsubject, published in the _Philosophical Transactions_ for 1830.\r\n\r\nAlthough I had thus combined two plain mirrors, so as to produce highly\r\npleasing effects, from the multiplication and circular arrangement of\r\nthe images of objects placed at a distance from their extremities, yet\r\nI had scarcely made a step towards the invention of the Kaleidoscope.\r\nThe effects, however, which I had observed, were sufficient to prepare\r\nme for taking advantage of any suggestion which experiment might\r\nafterwards throw in the way.\r\n\r\nIn repeating, at a subsequent period, the very beautiful experiments\r\nof M. Biot, on the action of homogeneous fluids upon polarized light,\r\nand in extending them to other fluids which he had not tried, I found\r\nit most convenient to place them in a triangular trough, formed by two\r\nplates of glass cemented together by two of their sides, so as to form\r\nan acute angle. The ends being closed up with pieces of plate glass\r\ncemented to the other plates, the trough was fixed horizontally, for\r\nthe reception of the fluids. The eye being necessarily placed without\r\nthe trough, and at one end, some of the cement, which had been pressed\r\nthrough between the plates at the object end of the trough, appeared\r\nto be arranged in a manner far more regular and symmetrical than I\r\nhad before observed when the objects, in my early experiments, were\r\nsituated at a distance from the reflectors. From the approximation to\r\nperfect symmetry which the figure now displayed, compared with the\r\ngreat deviation from symmetry which I had formerly observed, it was\r\nobvious that the progression from the one effect to the other must\r\ntake place during the passage of the object from the one position to\r\nthe other; and it became highly probable, that a position would be\r\nfound where the symmetry was mathematically perfect. By investigating\r\nthis subject optically, I discovered the leading principles of the\r\nKaleidoscope, in so far as the inclination of the reflectors, the\r\nposition of the object, and the position of the eye, were concerned.\r\nI found, that in order to produce perfectly beautiful and symmetrical\r\nforms, three conditions were necessary.\r\n\r\n1. That the reflectors should be placed at an angle, which was an\r\n_even_ or an _odd_ aliquot part of a circle, when the object was\r\nregular, and similarly situated with respect to both the mirrors; or\r\nthe _even_ aliquot part of a circle when the object was irregular, and\r\nhad any position whatever.\r\n\r\n2. That out of an infinite number of positions for the object, both\r\nwithin and without the reflectors, there was _only one_ where perfect\r\nsymmetry could be obtained, namely, when the object was placed in\r\ncontact with the ends of the reflectors. This was precisely the\r\nposition of the cement in the preceding experiment with the triangular\r\ntrough.\r\n\r\n3. That out of an infinite number of positions for the eye, there was\r\n_only one_ where the symmetry was perfect, namely, as near as possible\r\nto the angular point, so that the circular field could be distinctly\r\nseen; and that this point was the _only one_ out of an infinite number\r\nat which the uniformity of the light of the circular field was a\r\nmaximum, and from which the direct and the reflected images had the\r\nsame form and the same magnitude, in consequence of being placed at the\r\nsame distance from the eye. This, also, was the position in which the\r\neye was necessarily placed when looking through the fluid with which\r\nthe glass trough was partially filled.\r\n\r\nUpon these principles I constructed an instrument, in which I fixed\r\n_permanently_, across the ends of the reflectors, pieces of coloured\r\nglass, and other irregular objects; and I showed the instrument in this\r\nstate to some members of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, who were much\r\nstruck with the beauty of its effects. In this case, however, the forms\r\nwere nearly permanent; and slight, though beautiful, variations were\r\nproduced by varying the position of the instrument with respect to the\r\nsource of light.\r\n\r\nThe great step, however, towards the completion of the instrument\r\nremained yet to be made; and it was not till some time afterwards that\r\nthe idea occurred to me _of giving motion to objects, such as pieces\r\nof coloured glass, &c., which were either fixed or placed loosely in\r\na cell at the end of the instrument_. When this idea was carried into\r\nexecution, and the reflectors placed in a tube, and fitted up on the\r\npreceding principles, the Kaleidoscope, in its _simple form_, was\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nIn this form, however, the Kaleidoscope could not be considered as\r\na general philosophical instrument of universal application. The\r\nleast deviation of the object from the position of symmetry at the\r\nend of the reflectors, produced a deviation from beauty and symmetry\r\nin the figure, and this deviation increased with the distance of the\r\nobject. The use of the instrument was therefore limited to objects in\r\ncontact with the ends of the reflectors, or held close to them, and\r\nconsequently to objects, or groups of objects, whose magnitudes were\r\nless than its triangular aperture.\r\n\r\nThe next, and by far the most important step of the invention, was\r\nto remove this limitation, and to extend indefinitely the use and\r\napplication of the instrument. This effect was obtained by employing a\r\ndraw tube, containing a convex lens, or, what is better, an achromatic\r\nobject-glass of such a focal length, that the images of objects, of\r\nall magnitudes and at all distances, might be distinctly formed at the\r\nend of the reflectors, and introduced into the pictures created by the\r\ninstrument in the same manner as if they had been reduced in size, and\r\nplaced in the true position in which alone perfect symmetry could be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nWhen the Kaleidoscope was brought to this degree of perfection, it was\r\nimpossible not to perceive that it would prove of the highest service\r\nin all the ornamental arts, and would, at the same time, become a\r\npopular instrument for the purposes of rational amusement. With these\r\nviews I thought it advisable to secure the exclusive property of it\r\nby a Patent;[2] but in consequence of one of the patent instruments\r\nhaving been exhibited to some of the London opticians, the remarkable\r\nproperties of the Kaleidoscope became known before any number of them\r\ncould be prepared for sale. The sensation excited by this premature\r\nexhibition of its effects is incapable of description, and can be\r\nconceived only by those who witnessed it. “It very quickly became\r\npopular,” says Dr. Roget, in his excellent article on the KALEIDOSCOPE\r\nin the _Encyclopædia Britannica_, “and the sensation it excited in\r\nLondon throughout all ranks of people was astonishing. It afforded\r\ndelight to the poor as well as the rich; to the old as well as the\r\nyoung. Large cargoes of them were sent abroad, particularly to the East\r\nIndies. They very soon became known throughout Europe, and have been\r\nmet with by travellers even in the most obscure and retired villages in\r\nSwitzerland.” According to the computation of those who were best able\r\nto form an opinion on the subject, no fewer than two hundred thousand\r\ninstruments were sold in London and Paris during three months. Out of\r\nthis immense number there were perhaps not one thousand constructed\r\nupon scientific principles, and capable of giving anything like a\r\ncorrect idea of the power of the Kaleidoscope; and of the millions who\r\nhave witnessed its effects, there is perhaps not a hundred individuals\r\nwho have any idea of the principles upon which it is constructed, who\r\nare capable of distinguishing the spurious from the real instrument, or\r\nwho have sufficient knowledge of its principles to be able to apply it\r\nto the numerous branches of the useful and ornamental arts.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances I have thought it necessary to draw up\r\nthe following short treatise, for the purpose of explaining, in as\r\npopular a manner as I could, the principles and construction of the\r\nKaleidoscope; of describing the different forms in which it is fitted\r\nup; of pointing out the various methods of using it as an instrument\r\nof recreation; and of instructing the artist how to employ it in the\r\nnumerous branches of the useful and ornamental arts to which it is\r\napplicable.\r\n\r\n[2] As this Patent, in so far as the simple Kaleidoscope is concerned,\r\nwas to a great extent infringed, it has been supposed that it was\r\nreduced in a Court of Law. The validity of the Patent was never\r\nquestioned by any lawyer, or any philosopher acquainted with its theory\r\nand construction, as will appear from the opinion of four competent\r\njudges, given in the _Appendix_.\r\n\r\nIn a trial for the infringement of a Patent several years ago, a\r\ndistinguished judge (we believe it was Judge Alderson) stated it as\r\na fact, that the Patent for the Kaleidoscope had been set aside in a\r\nCourt of Law. The party whose case was prejudiced by this erroneous\r\nassertion, applied to me for an affidavit, by which he was enabled to\r\ncontradict it in Court, and remove any unfavourable impression it might\r\nhave made upon the jury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PRINCIPLES RESPECTING THE EFFECTS OF COMBINING TWO PLAIN\r\nMIRRORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal parts of the Kaleidoscope are two reflecting planes, made\r\nof glass, or metal, or any other reflecting substance ground perfectly\r\nflat and highly polished. These reflectors, which are generally made\r\nof plate glass, either rough ground on their outer side, or covered\r\nwith black varnish, may be of any size, but in general they should be\r\nfrom four or five to ten or twelve inches long; their greatest breadth\r\nbeing about an inch when the length is six inches, and increasing in\r\nproportion as the length increases. When these two plates are put\r\ntogether at an angle of 60°, or the sixth part of a circle, as shown\r\nin Fig. 1, and the eye placed at the narrow end =E=, it will observe\r\nthe opening =A O B= multiplied six times, and arranged round the centre\r\n=O=, as shown in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nIn order to understand how this effect is produced, let us take a\r\nsmall sector of white paper of the shape =A O B=, Fig. 2, and having\r\nlaid it on a black ground, let the extremity =A O= of one of the\r\nreflectors be placed upon the edge =A O= of the sector. It is then\r\nobvious that an image =A O _b_= of this white sector of paper will be\r\nformed behind the mirror =A O=, and will have the same magnitude and\r\nthe same situation behind the mirror as the sector =A O B= had before\r\nit. In like manner, if we place the edge =B O= of the other reflector\r\nupon the other side =B O= of the paper sector, a similar image =B O\r\n_a_= will be formed behind it. The origin of three of the sectors seen\r\nround =O= is therefore explained: the first, =A O B=, is the white\r\npaper sector seen by direct vision; the second, =A O _b_=, is an image\r\nof the first formed by _one_ reflexion from the mirror =A O=; and the\r\nthird is another image of the first formed by _one_ reflexion from the\r\nother mirror =B O=. But it is well known, that the reflected image of\r\nany object, when placed before another mirror, has an image of itself\r\nformed behind this mirror, in the very same manner as if it were a new\r\nobject. Hence it follows, that the image =A O _b_= being, as it were, a\r\nnew object placed before the mirror =B O=, will have an image =_a_ O α=\r\nof itself formed behind =B O=; and for the same reason the image =B O\r\n_a_= will have an image =_b_ O β= of itself, formed behind the mirror =A\r\nO=, and both these new images will occupy the same position behind the\r\nmirrors as the other images did before the mirrors.\r\n\r\nA difficulty now presents itself in accounting for the formation of the\r\nlast or sixth sector, =α O β=. Mr. Harris, in the XVIIth Prop. of his\r\nOptics, has evaded this difficulty, and given a false demonstration of\r\nthe proposition. He remarks, that the last sector, =α O β= is produced\r\n“by the reflexion of the rays forming either of the two last images”\r\n(namely, =_b_ O β= and =_a_ O α=); but this is clearly absurd, for the\r\nsector =α O β= would thus be formed of two images lying above each\r\nother, which is impossible. In order to understand the true cause of\r\nthe formation of the sector =α O β=, we must recollect that the line =O\r\nE= is the line of junction of the mirrors, and that the eye is placed\r\nany where in the plane passing through =O E= and bisecting =A O B=.\r\nNow, if the mirror, =B O=, had extended as far as =O β=, the sector =α\r\nO β= would have been the image of the sector =_b_ O β=, reflected from\r\n=B O=; and in like manner, if the mirror =A O= had extended as far as\r\n=O α=, the sector =α O β= would have been the image of the sector =_a_\r\nO α= reflected from =A O=; but as this overlapping or extension of the\r\nmirrors is impossible, and as they must necessarily join at the line\r\n=O E=, it follows, that an image =α O _e_=, of only half the sector\r\n=_b_ O β=, viz., =_b_ O _r_=, can be seen by reflexion from the mirror\r\n=B O=; and that an image =β O _e_=, of only half the sector =_a_ O α=,\r\nviz., =_a_ O _s_=, can be seen by reflexion from the mirror =A O=.\r\nHence it is manifest, that the last sector, =α O β=, is not, as Mr.\r\nHarris supposes, _a reflexion from either of the two last images_, =_b\r\no_ β=, =_a o_ α=, but is composed of the images of two half sectors,\r\none of which is formed by the mirror =A O=, and the other by the mirror\r\n=B O=.\r\n\r\nMr. Harris repeats the same mistake in a more serious form, in his\r\nsecond Scholium, § 240, where he shows that the images are arranged\r\nin the circumference of a circle. The two images =D=, _d_, says he,\r\ncoincide and make but one image. Mr. Wood has committed the very same\r\nmistake in his second Corollary to Prop. XIV., and his demonstration\r\nof that Corollary is decidedly erroneous. This Corollary is stated in\r\nthe following manner:—“When _a_ (the angle of the mirrors) is a measure\r\nof 180° _two images coincide_,” and it is demonstrated, that _since\r\ntwo images of any object_ =X= (Fig. 2) _must be formed_, viz., one by\r\neach mirror, and since these two images must be formed at 180° from\r\nthe object =X=, placed between the mirrors, that is, at the same point\r\n_x_, it follows that the two images must coincide. Now, it will appear\r\nfrom the simplest considerations, that the assumption, as well as the\r\nconclusion, is erroneous. The image _x_ is seen by the last reflexion\r\nfrom the mirror =B O E=, and another image _would be seen at x_, if the\r\nmirror =A O E= had extended as far as _x_; but as this is impossible,\r\nwithout covering the part of the mirror =B O E=, which gives the first\r\nimage _x_, there can be only one image seen at _x_. When the object =X=\r\nis equidistant from =A= and =B=, then one-half of the last reflected\r\nimage _x_ will be formed by the last reflexion from the mirror =B O=,\r\nand the other half by the last reflexion from the mirror =A O=, and\r\nthese two half images will join each other, and form a whole image at\r\n_e_, as perfect as any of the rest. In this last case, when the angle\r\n=A O B= is a little different from an even aliquot part of 360°, the\r\neye at =E= will perceive at _e_ an appearance of two incoincident\r\nimages; but this arises from the pupil of the eye being partly on one\r\nside of =E= and partly on the other; and, therefore, the apparent\r\nduplication of the image is removed by looking through a very small\r\naperture at =E=. As the preceding remarks are equally true, whatever be\r\nthe inclination of the mirrors, provided it is an even aliquot part of\r\na circle, it follows,—\r\n\r\n1. That when =A O B= is ¼, ⅙, ⅛, ⅒, ¹/₁₂, etc., of a circle, the number\r\nof reflected images of any object =X=, is 4 - 1, 6 - 1, 8 - 1, 10 - 1,\r\n12 - 1.\r\n\r\n2. That when =X= is nearer one mirror than another, the number of\r\nimages seen by reflexion from the mirror to which it is nearest will\r\nbe ⁴/₂, ⁶/₂, ⁸/₂, ¹⁰/₂, ¹²/₂, while the number of images formed by the\r\nmirror from which =X= is most distant will be ⁴/₂ - 1, ⁶/₂ - 1, ⁸/₂ -\r\n1, ¹⁰/₂ - 1; that is, an image more always reaches the eye from the\r\nmirror nearest =X=, than from the mirror farthest from it.\r\n\r\n3. That when =X= is equidistant from =A O= and =B O=, the number of\r\nimages which reaches the eye from each mirror is equal, and is always\r\n\r\n    4 - 1, 6 - 1, 8 - 1, 10 - 1, 12 - 1\r\n    -----  -----  -----  ------  ------\r\n      2      2      2       2       2\r\n\r\nwhich are fractional values, showing that the last image is composed of\r\ntwo half images.\r\n\r\nWhen the inclination of the mirrors, or the angle =A O B=, Fig. 3,\r\nis an _odd_ aliquot part of a circle, such as ⅓, ⅕, ⅐, ⅑, etc., the\r\ndifferent sectors which compose the circular image are formed in the\r\nvery same manner as has been already described; but as the number of\r\n_reflected sectors_ must in this case always be _even_, the line =O E=,\r\nwhere the mirrors join, will separate the two last reflected sectors,\r\n=_b_ O _e_=, =_a_ O _e_=. Hence it follows,—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\n1. That when =A O B= is ⅓, ⅕, ⅐, ⅑, etc., of a circle, the number of\r\nreflected images of any object is 3 - 1, 5 - 1, 7 - 1, etc., and,—\r\n\r\n2. That the number of images which reach the eye from each mirror is\r\n\r\n    3 - 1  5 - 1  7 - 1,\r\n    -----, -----, -----,\r\n      2      2      2\r\n\r\nwhich are always even numbers.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have supposed the inclination of the mirrors to be\r\n_exactly_ either an even or an odd aliquot part of a circle. We shall\r\nnow proceed to consider the effects which will be produced when this is\r\nnot the case.\r\n\r\nIf the angle =A O B=, Fig. 2, is made to increase from being an _even_\r\naliquot part of a circle, such as ⅙th, till it becomes an _odd_\r\naliquot part, such as ⅐th, the last reflected image =β O α=, composed\r\nof the two halves =β O _e_=, =α O _e_=, will gradually increase, in\r\nconsequence of each of the halves increasing; and when =A O B= becomes\r\n⅐th of the circle, the sector =β O α= will become double of =A O B=,\r\nand =α O _e_=, =β O _e_= will become each complete sectors, or equal to\r\n=A O B=.\r\n\r\nIf the angle =A O B= is made to vary from ⅙th to ⅕th of a circle, the\r\nlast sector =β O α= will gradually diminish, in consequence of each of\r\nits halves, =β O _e_=, =α O _e_=, diminishing; and just when the angle\r\nbecomes ⅙th of a circle, the sector =β O α= will have become infinitely\r\nsmall, and the two sectors, =_b_ O β=, =_a_ O α=, will join each other\r\nexactly at the line =O _e_=, as in Fig. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n    ON THE PRINCIPLES OF THE KALEIDOSCOPE, AND THE\r\n        FORMATION OF SYMMETRICAL PICTURES BY THE\r\n        COMBINATION OF DIRECT AND INVERTED IMAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principles which we have laid down in the preceding chapter must\r\nnot be considered as in any respect the principles of the Kaleidoscope.\r\nThey are merely a series of preliminary deductions, by means of which\r\nthe principles of the Instrument may be illustrated, and they go no\r\nfarther than to explain the formation of an apparent circular aperture\r\nby means of successive reflexions.\r\n\r\nAll the various forms which nature and art present to us, may be\r\ndivided into two classes, namely, _simple_ or _irregular_ forms, and\r\n_compound_ or _regular_ forms. To the first class belong all those\r\nforms which are called picturesque, and which cannot be reduced to two\r\nforms similar, and similarly situated with regard to a given point; and\r\nto the second class belong the forms of animals, the forms of regular\r\narchitectural buildings, the forms of most articles of furniture and\r\nornament, the forms of many natural productions, and all forms, in\r\nshort, which are composed of two forms, similar and similarly situated\r\nwith regard to a given line or plane.\r\n\r\nNow, it is obvious that all compound forms of this kind are composed\r\nof a direct and an inverted image of a simple or an irregular form;\r\nand, therefore, every simple form can be converted into a compound\r\nor beautiful form, by skilfully combining it with an inverted image\r\nof itself, formed by reflexion. The image, however, must be formed\r\nby reflexion from the first surface of the mirror, in order that the\r\ndirect and the reflected image may join, and constitute one united\r\nwhole; for if the image is reflected from the posterior surface, as\r\nin the case of a looking-glass, the direct and the inverted image can\r\nnever coalesce into one form, but must always be separated by a space\r\nequal to the thickness of the mirror-glass.\r\n\r\nIf we arrange simple forms in the most perfect manner round a centre,\r\nit is impossible by any art to combine them into a symmetrical and\r\nbeautiful picture. The regularity of their arrangement may give some\r\nsatisfaction to the eye, but the adjacent forms can never join, and\r\nmust therefore form a picture composed of disunited parts.\r\n\r\nThe case, however, is quite different with compound forms. If we\r\narrange a succession of similar forms of this class round a centre, it\r\nnecessarily follows that they will all combine into one perfect whole,\r\nin which all the parts either are or may be united, and which will\r\ndelight the eye by its symmetry and beauty.\r\n\r\nIn order to illustrate the preceding observations, we have represented\r\nin Figs. 4 and 5 the effects produced by the multiplication of single\r\nand compound forms. The line _a b c d_, for example, Fig. 4, is a\r\nsimple form, and is arranged round a centre in the same way as it would\r\nbe done by a perfect multiplying glass, if such a thing could be made.\r\nThe consecutive forms are all disunited, and do not compose a whole.\r\nFig. 5 represents the very same simple form, _a b c d_, converted into\r\na compound form, and then, as it were, multiplied and arranged round a\r\ncentre. In this case every part of the figure is united, and forms a\r\nwhole, in which there is nothing redundant and nothing deficient; and\r\nthis is the precise effect which is produced by the application of the\r\nKaleidoscope to the simple form _a b c_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\nThe fundamental principle, therefore, of the Kaleidoscope is, that\r\nit produces symmetrical and beautiful pictures, by converting simple\r\ninto compound or beautiful forms, and arranging them, by successive\r\nreflexions, into one perfect whole.\r\n\r\nThis principle, it will be readily seen, cannot be discovered by any\r\nexamination of the luminous sectors which compose the circular field of\r\nthe Kaleidoscope, and is not even alluded to in any of the propositions\r\ngiven by Mr. Harris and Mr. Wood. In looking at the circular field\r\ncomposed of an even and an odd number of reflexions, the arrangement\r\nof the sectors is perfect in both cases; but when the number is odd,\r\nand the form of the object simple, and when the object is not similarly\r\nplaced with regard to the two mirrors, a symmetrical and united picture\r\ncannot possibly be produced. Hence it is manifest, that neither the\r\nprinciples nor the effects of the Kaleidoscope could possibly be\r\ndeduced from any practical knowledge respecting the luminous sectors.\r\n\r\nIn order to explain the formation of the symmetrical picture shown in\r\nFig. 5, we must consider that the simple form _m n_, Fig. 2, is seen\r\nby direct vision through the open sector =A O B=, and that the image\r\n_n o_, of the object _m n_, formed by one reflexion in the sector =B\r\nO _a_=, is necessarily an inverted image. But since the image _o p_,\r\nin the sector =_a_ O α=, is a reflected and consequently an inverted\r\nimage of the _inverted image_, _m t_, in the sector =A O _b_=, it\r\nfollows, that the whole _n o p_ is an inverted image of the whole _n\r\nm t_. Hence the image _n o_ will unite with the image _o p_, in the\r\nsame manner as _m n_ unites with _m t_. But as these two last unite\r\ninto a regular form, the two first will also unite into a regular or\r\ncompound form. Now, since the half =β O _e_= of the last sector =β O α=\r\nwas formerly shown to be an image of the half sector =_a_ O _s_=, the\r\nline _q v_ will also be an image of the line _o z_, and for the same\r\nreason the line _v p_ will be an image of _t y_. But the image _v p_\r\nforms the same angle with =B O= or _n q_ that _t y_ does, and is equal\r\nand similar to _t y_; and _q v_ forms the same angle with =A O= that\r\n_o z_ does, and is equal and similar to _o z_. Hence, =O _o_ =\r\n_o q_=, and =O _y_ O _v_=, and therefore _q v_ and _v p_ will form\r\none straight line, equal and similar to _t q_, and similarly situated\r\nwith respect to =B O=. The figure _m n o p q t_, therefore, composed of\r\none direct object, and several reflected images of that object, will\r\nbe symmetrical. As the same reasoning is applicable to every object\r\nextending across the aperture =A O B=, whether simple or compound, and\r\nto every angle =A O B=, which is an even aliquot part of a circle, it\r\nfollows,—\r\n\r\n1. That when the inclination of the mirror is an _even_ aliquot part of\r\na circle, the object seen by direct vision across the aperture, whether\r\nit is simple or compound, is so united with the images of it formed by\r\nrepeated reflexions, as to form a symmetrical picture.\r\n\r\n2. That the symmetrical picture is composed of a series of parts, the\r\nnumber of which is equal to the number of times that the angle =A O B=\r\nis contained in 360°. And—\r\n\r\n3. That these parts are alternately direct and inverted pictures of the\r\nobject; a direct picture of it being always placed between two inverted\r\nones, and, _vice versa_, so that the number of direct pictures is equal\r\nto the number of inverted ones.\r\n\r\nWhen the inclination of the mirrors is an _odd_ aliquot part of 360°,\r\nsuch as ⅕th, as shown in Fig. 3, the picture formed by the combination\r\nof the direct object and its reflected images is symmetrical only under\r\nparticular circumstances.\r\n\r\nIf the object, whether simple or compound, is similarly situated with\r\nrespect to each of the mirrors, as the straight line 1, 2 of Fig. 6,\r\nthe compound line 3, 4, the inclined lines 5, 6, the circular object 7,\r\nthe curved line 8, 9, and the radial line 10, =O=, then the images of\r\nall these objects will also be similarly situated with respect to the\r\nradial lines that separate the sectors, and will therefore form a whole\r\nperfectly symmetrical, whether the number of sectors is odd or even.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\nBut when the objects are not similarly situated with respect to each of\r\nthe mirrors, as the compound line 1, 2, Fig. 8, the curved line 3, 4,\r\nand the straight line 5, 6, and, in general, as all irregular objects\r\nthat are presented by accident to the instrument, then the image formed\r\nin the last sector =_a_ O _e_=, Fig. 7, by the mirror =B O=, will not\r\njoin with the image formed in the last sector =_b_ O _e_=, by the\r\nmirror =A O=. In order to explain this with sufficient perspicuity, let\r\nus take the case where the angle is 72°, or ⅕th part of the circle,\r\nas shown in Fig. 7. Let =A O=, =B O=, be the reflecting planes, and\r\n_m n_ a line, _inclined to the radius which bisects the angle_ =A O\r\nB=, so that =_o m_ > _o n_=; then _m nʹ_, _n mʹ_, will be the images\r\nformed by the first reflexion from =A O= and =B O=, and _nʹ mʺ_, _mʹ\r\nnʺ_, the images formed by the second reflexion; but by the principles\r\nof catoptrics, =o _m_ = o _mʹ_ = O _mʺ_=, and =O _n_ = O _nʹ_\r\n= O _nʺ_=, consequently since =O _m_= is by hypothesis greater than\r\n=O _n_=, we shall have =O _mʺ_= greater than =O _nʺ_=; that is, the\r\nimages _mʹ nʺ_, _nʹ mʺ_, will not coincide. As =O _n_= approaches to\r\nan equality with =O _m_=, =O _nʺ_= approaches to an equality with =O\r\n_mʺ_=, and when =O _m_ = O _n_=, we have =O _nʺ_ = O _mʺ_=, and at\r\nthis limit the images are symmetrically arranged, which is the case\r\nof the straight line 1, 2 in Fig. 6. By tracing the images of the\r\nother lines, as is done in Fig. 8, it will be seen, that in every case\r\nthe picture is destitute of symmetry when the object has not the same\r\nposition with respect to the two mirrors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\nThis result may be deduced in a more simple manner, by considering\r\nthat the symmetrical picture formed by the Kaleidoscope contains half\r\nas many pairs of forms as the number of times that the inclination\r\nof the mirrors is contained in 360°; and that each pair consists of\r\na direct and an inverted form, so joined as to form a compound form.\r\nNow the compound form made up by each pair obviously constitutes a\r\nsymmetrical picture when multiplied any number of times, whether even\r\nor odd; but if we combine so many pair and half a pair, two direct\r\nimages will come together, the half pair cannot possibly join both with\r\nthe direct and the inverted image on each side of it, and therefore\r\na symmetrical whole cannot be obtained from such a combination. From\r\nthese observations we may conclude,—\r\n\r\n1. That when the inclination of the mirrors is an _odd_ aliquot part\r\nof a circle, the object seen by direct vision through the aperture\r\nunites with the images of it formed by repeated reflexions, and forms\r\na complete and symmetrical picture, only in the case when the object\r\nis similarly situated with respect to both the mirrors; the two last\r\nsectors forming, in every other position of the object, an imperfect\r\njunction, in consequence of these being either both direct or both\r\ninverted pictures of the object.\r\n\r\n2. That the series of parts which compose the symmetrical as well as\r\nthe unsymmetrical picture, consists of direct and inverted pictures of\r\nthe object, the number of direct pictures being always equal to half\r\nthe number of sectors increased by one, when the number of sectors is\r\n5, 9, 13, 17, 21, etc., and the number of inverted pictures being equal\r\nto half the number of sectors diminished by one, when the number of\r\nsectors is 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, etc., and _vice versa_. Hence, the number\r\nof direct pictures of the object must always be odd, and the number of\r\ninverted pictures even, as appears from the following table:—\r\n\r\n    Inclination   Number     Number of   Number of\r\n      of the        of        Inverted    Direct\r\n     Mirrors.    Sectors.    Pictures.   Pictures.\r\n\r\n      120°         3          2           1\r\n       72          5          2           3\r\n       51³/₇       7          4           3\r\n       40          9          4           5\r\n       32⁸/₁₁      11          6           5\r\n       27⁹/₁₃      13          6           7\r\n       24          15          8           7\r\n       21³/₁₇      17          8           9\r\n       18¹⁸/₁₉     19         10           9\r\n       17⅐         21        10          11\r\n\r\n3. That when the number of sectors is 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, etc., the two\r\nlast sectors are inverted; and when the number is 5, 9, 13, 17, 21,\r\netc., the two last sectors are direct.\r\n\r\nWhen the inclination of the mirrors is not an aliquot part of 360°,\r\nthe images formed by the last reflexions do not join like every other\r\npair of images, and therefore the picture which is created must be\r\nimperfect. It has already been shown at the end of Chap. I. that when\r\nthe angle of the mirrors becomes greater than an even or less than an\r\nodd aliquot part of a circle, each of the two incomplete sectors which\r\nform the last sector becomes greater or less than half a sector. The\r\nimage of the object comprehended in each of the incomplete sectors\r\nmust therefore be greater or less than the images in half a sector;\r\nthat is, when the last sector =β O α=, Fig. 2, is greater than =A O\r\nB=, the part _q v_ in one half must be the image of more than _o z_,\r\nand _v p_ the image of more than _t y_, and _vice versa_, when =β O α=\r\nis less than =A O B=. Hence it follows that the symmetry is imperfect\r\nfrom the image in the last sector being greater or less than the other\r\nimages. But besides this cause of imperfection in the symmetry, there\r\nis another, namely, the disunion of the two images _q v_ and _v p_.\r\nThe angles =O _q v_= and =O _o p_= are obviously equal, and also the\r\nangles =O _p v_=, =O _p o_=; but since the angle =β O α=, or= _q_ O\r\n_p_=, is by hypothesis greater or less than =_p_ O _o_=, it follows\r\nthat the angles of the triangle =_q_ O _p_= are either greater or less\r\nthan two right angles, because they are greater or less than the three\r\nangles of the triangle =_p_ O _o_=. But as this is absurd, the lines _q\r\nv_, _v p_, cannot join so as to form one straight line, and therefore\r\nthe completion of a perfect figure by means of two mirrors, whose\r\ninclination is not an aliquot part of a circle, is impossible. When the\r\nangle =β O α= is greater than =_p_ O _o_=, or =A O B=, the lines _q v_,\r\n_v p_, will form a re-entering angle towards =O=, and when it is less\r\nthan =A O B=, the same lines will form a salient angle towards =O=.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nON THE EFFECTS PRODUCED BY THE MOTION OF THE OBJECT AND THE MIRRORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto we have considered both the object and the mirrors as\r\nstationary, and we have contemplated only the effects produced by the\r\nunion of the different parts of the picture. The variations, however,\r\nwhich the picture exhibits, have a very singular character, when either\r\nthe objects or the mirrors are put in motion. Let us, first, consider\r\nthe effects produced by the motion of the object when the mirrors are\r\nat rest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\nIf the object moves from =X= to =O=, Fig. 9, in the direction of\r\nthe radius, all the images will likewise move towards =O=, and the\r\npatterns will have the appearance of being absorbed or extinguished in\r\nthe centre. If the motion of the object is from =O= to =X=, the images\r\nwill also move outwards in the direction of the radii, and the pattern\r\nwill appear to develop itself from the centre =O=, and to be lost or\r\nabsorbed at the circumference of the luminous field. The objects that\r\nmove parallel to =X O= will have their centre of development, or their\r\ncentre of absorption, at the point in the lines =A O=, =B O=, _a_ =O=,\r\n_b_ =O=, etc. where the direction in which the images move cuts these\r\nlines. When the object passes across the field in a circle concentric\r\nwith =A B=, and in the direction =A B=, the images in all the sectors\r\nformed by an even number of reflexions will move in the same direction\r\n=A B=, namely, in the direction β _b_, _a_ α; while those that have\r\nbeen formed by an odd number of reflexions will move in an opposite\r\ndirection, namely, in the directions _a_ =B=, =A= _b_. Hence, if the\r\nobject moves from =A= to =B=, the points of absorption will be in the\r\nlines =B O=, α =O=, and _b_ =O=, and the points of development in the\r\nlines =A O=, _a_ =O=, and β =O=, and _vice versa_, when the motion of\r\nthe object is from =B= to =A=.\r\n\r\nIf the object moves in an oblique direction _m n_, the images will move\r\nin the directions _m t_, _o n_, _o p_, _q t_, _q p_, and _m_, _o_, _q_,\r\nwill be the centres of development, and _n_, _p_, _t_, the centres of\r\nabsorption; whereas, if the object moves from _n_ to _m_, these centres\r\nwill be interchanged. These results are susceptible of the simplest\r\ndemonstration, by supposing the object in one or two successive points\r\nof its path _m n_, and considering that the image must be formed at\r\npoints similarly situated behind the mirrors; the line passing through\r\nthese points will be the path of the image, and the order in which the\r\nimages succeed each other will give the direction of their motion.\r\nHence, we may conclude in general,\r\n\r\n1. That when the path of the object cuts both the mirrors =A O= and =B\r\nO= like _m n_, the centre of absorption will be in the radius passing\r\nthrough the section of the mirror to which the object moves, and in\r\nevery alternate radius; and that the centre of development will be in\r\nthe radius passing through the section of the mirror from which the\r\nobject moves, and in all the alternate radii: and,\r\n\r\n2. That when the path of the object cuts any one of the mirrors and\r\nthe circumference of the circular field, the centre of absorption will\r\nbe in all the radii which separate the sectors, and the centre of\r\ndevelopment in the circumference of the field, if the motion is towards\r\nthe mirror, but _vice versa_ if the motion is towards the circumference.\r\n\r\nWhen the objects are at rest, and the Kaleidoscope in motion, a new\r\nseries of appearances is presented. Whatever be the direction in which\r\nthe Kaleidoscope moves, the object seen by direct vision must always\r\nbe stationary, and it is easy to determine the changes which take\r\nplace when the Kaleidoscope has a progressive motion over the object.\r\nA very curious effect, however, is observed when the Kaleidoscope has\r\na rotatory motion round the angular point, or rather round the common\r\nsection of the two mirrors. The picture created by the Instrument\r\nseems to be composed of two pictures, one in motion round the centre\r\nof the circular field, and the other at rest. The sectors formed by an\r\nodd number of reflexions are all in motion in the same direction as\r\nthe Kaleidoscope, while the sector seen by direct vision, and all the\r\nsectors formed by an even number of reflexions, are at rest. In order\r\nto understand this, let =M=, Fig. 10, be a plane mirror, and =A= an\r\nobject whose image is formed at _a_, so that =_a_ M = A M=. Let the\r\nmirror =M= advance to =N=, and the object =A=, which remains fixed,\r\nwill have its image _b_ formed at such a distance behind =N=, that =_b_\r\nN = A N=; then it will be found that the space moved through by the\r\nimage is double the space moved through by the mirror; that is, =_a b_\r\n= 2 M N=. Since =M N = A M - A N=, and since =A M = _a_ M=, and\r\n=A N = _b_ N=, we have =M N = _a_ M - _b_ N=; and adding =M N= or\r\nits equal =_b_ M + _b_ N= to both sides of the equation, we obtain\r\n=2M N = _a_ M - _b_ N + _b_ N + _b_ M=; but =-_b_ N + _b_N = 0=,\r\nand =_a_ M + _b_ M = _a b_=; hence =2M N = _a b_=. This result may be\r\nobtained otherwise, by considering, that if the mirror =M= advances\r\n_one inch_ towards =A=, one inch is added to the distance of the image\r\n_a_, and one subtracted from the distance of the object; that is, the\r\ndifference of these distances is now two inches, or twice the space\r\nmoved through by the mirror; but since the new distance of the object\r\nis equal to the distance of the new image, the difference of these\r\ndistances, which is the space moved through by the image, must be two\r\ninches, or twice the space described by the mirror.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\nLet us now suppose that the object A advances in the same direction as\r\nthe mirror, and with twice its velocity, so as to describe a space =A\r\nα = 2 M N = _a b_=, in the same time that the mirror moves through =M\r\nN=, the object being at α when the mirror is at =N=. Then, since =A\r\nα = _a b_= and =_b_ N = A N=, the whole =α N= is equal to the whole\r\n=_a_ N=, that is, =_a_= will still be the place of the image. Hence it\r\nfollows, _that if the object advances in the same direction as the\r\nmirror, but with twice its velocity, the image will remain stationary_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\nIf the object =A= moves in a direction opposite to that of the mirror,\r\nand with double its velocity, as is shown in Fig. 11; then, since _b_\r\nwould be the image when =A= was stationary, and when =M= had moved to\r\n=N=, in which case =_a b_ = 2 M N=, and _bʹ_ the image when =A= had\r\nadvanced to =α= through a space =A α = 2 M N=, we have =_b_ N = A N=, and\r\n=_bʹ_ N = α N=, and, therefore,= _b bʹ_ = A N - α N = A α = 2 M N=, and\r\n=_a b_ + _b bʹ_= or its equal =_a bʹ_ = 4 M N=. Hence it follows, _that\r\nwhen the object advances towards the mirror with twice its velocity,\r\nthe image will move with four times the velocity of the mirror_.\r\n\r\nIf the mirror =M= moves round a centre, the very same results will be\r\nobtained from the very same reasoning, only the angular motion of the\r\nmirror and the image will then be more conveniently measured by parts\r\nof a circle or degrees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.]\r\n\r\nNow, in Fig. 12, let =X= be a fixed object, and =A O=, =B O=, two\r\nmirrors placed at an angle of 60° and moveable round =O= as a centre.\r\nWhen the eye is applied to the end of the mirrors (or at =E=, Fig. 1),\r\nthe fixed object =X=, Fig. 12, seen by direct vision will, of course,\r\nbe stationary, while the mirrors describe an arch =X= of 10° for\r\nexample; but since =A O= has approached =X= by 10°, the image of =X=\r\nformed behind =A O= must have approached =X= by 20°, and consequently\r\nmoves with twice the velocity in the same direction as the mirrors.\r\nIn like manner, since =B O= has receded 10° from =X=, the image of\r\n=X= formed by =B O= must have receded 20° from =X=, and consequently\r\nmust have moved with twice the velocity in the same direction as the\r\nmirrors. Now, the image of =X= in the sector =_b_ O β= is, as it were,\r\nan image of the image in =B O _a_= reflected from =A O=. But the image\r\nin =B O _a_= advances in the same direction as the mirror =A O= and\r\nwith twice its velocity, hence the image of it in the sector =_b_ O β=\r\nwill be stationary. In like manner it may be shown, that the image in\r\nthe sector =_a_ O α= will be stationary. Since =α O _e_= is an image of\r\n=_b_ O _r_= reflected from the mirror =B O=, and since all images in\r\nthat sector are stationary, the corresponding images in =α O _e_= will\r\nmove in the same direction =α β= as the mirrors; and for the same reason\r\nthe images in the other half-sector =β O _e_= will move in the same\r\ndirection; hence, the image of any object formed in the last sector =α\r\nO β= will move in the same direction, and with the same velocity as the\r\nimages in the sectors =A O _b_=, =B O _a_=.\r\n\r\nBy a similar process of reasoning, the same results will be obtained,\r\nwhatever be the number of the sectors, and whether the angle =A O B= be\r\nthe even or the odd aliquot part of a circle. Hence we may conclude,\r\n\r\n1. That during the rotatory motion of the mirrors round =O=, the\r\nobjects in the sector seen by direct vision, and all the images of\r\nthese objects formed by an even number of reflexions are at rest.\r\n\r\n2. That all the images of these objects, formed by an odd number of\r\nreflexions, move round =O= in the same direction as the mirrors, and\r\nwith an angular velocity double that of the mirrors.\r\n\r\n3. That when the angle =A O B= is an _even_ aliquot part of a circle,\r\nthe number of moving sectors is equal to the number of stationary\r\nsectors, a moving sector being placed between two stationary sectors,\r\nand _vice versa_.\r\n\r\n4. That when the angle =A O B= is an _odd_ aliquot part of a circle,\r\nthe two last sectors adjacent to each other are either both in motion\r\nor both stationary, the number of moving sectors being greater by one\r\nwhen the number of sectors is 3, 7, 11, 15, etc., and the number of\r\nstationary sectors being greater by one when the number of sectors is\r\n5, 9, 13, 17, etc. And,\r\n\r\n5. That as the moving sectors correspond with those in which the images\r\nare inverted, and the stationary ones with those in which the images\r\nare direct, the number of each may be found from the table given in\r\npage 24.\r\n\r\nWhen one of the mirrors, =A O=, is stationary, while the other, =B O=,\r\nis moved round, and so as to enlarge the angle =A O B=, the object =X=,\r\nand the image of it seen in the stationary mirror =A O=, remain at\r\nrest, but all the other images are in motion receding from the object\r\n=X=, and its stationary image; and when =B O= moves towards =A O=, so\r\nas to diminish the angle =A O B=, the same effect takes place, only\r\nthe motion of the images is towards the object =X=, on one side, and\r\ntowards its stationary image on the other. These images will obviously\r\nmove in pairs; for, since the fixed object and its stationary image are\r\nat an invariable distance, the existence of a symmetrical arrangement,\r\nwhich we have formerly proved, requires that similar pairs be arranged\r\nat equal distances round =O=, and each of the images of these pairs\r\nmust be stationary with regard to the other. Now, as the fixed object\r\nis placed in the sector =A O B=, and its stationary image in the\r\nsector =A O _b_=, it will be found that in the semicircle =M _b e_=,\r\ncontaining the fixed mirror, the\r\n\r\n    1st reflected image and direct object,      }\r\n    2d                      3d reflected image  }\r\n    4th                     5th                 } are stationary with\r\n    6th                     7th                 } respect to each other.\r\n    8th                     9th                 }\r\n\r\nwhile in the same semicircle =M _b e_=, the\r\n\r\n    1st reflected image and 2d reflected image  }\r\n    3d                      4th                 }\r\n    5th                     6th                 } are movable with\r\n    7th                     8th                 } respect to each other.\r\n    9th                    10th                 }\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the semicircle =M _a e_=, containing the movable\r\nmirror, the phenomena are reversed, the images which were formerly\r\nstationary with respect to each other being now movable, and _vice\r\nversa_.\r\n\r\nIn considering the velocity with which each pair of images revolves,\r\nit will be readily seen that the pair on each side, and nearest the\r\nfixed pair, will have an angular velocity _double_ that of the mirror\r\n=B O=; the next pair on each side will have a velocity _four_ times as\r\ngreat as that of the mirror; the next pair will have a velocity _eight_\r\ntimes as great, and the next pair a velocity _sixteen_ times as great\r\nas that of the mirror, the velocity of any pair being always double the\r\nvelocity of the pair which is adjacent to it on the side of the fixed\r\npair. The reason of this will be manifest, when we recollect what has\r\nalready been demonstrated, that the velocity of the image is always\r\ndouble that of the mirror, when the mirror alone moves towards the\r\nobject, and quadruple that of the mirror when both are in motion, and\r\nwhen the object approaches the mirror with twice the velocity. When =B\r\nO= moves from =A O=, the image in the sector =B O _a_= moves with twice\r\nthe velocity of the mirror; but since the image in =_b_ O β= is an\r\nimage of the image in =B O _a_= reflected from the fixed mirror =A O=,\r\nit also will move with the same velocity, or twice that of the mirror\r\n=B O=. Again, the image in the sector =_a_ O α=, being a reflexion of\r\nthe stationary image in =A O _b_= from the moving mirror, will itself\r\nmove with double the velocity of the mirror. But the image in the next\r\nsector =α O β= is a reflexion of the image in =_b_ O β= from the moving\r\nmirror =B O=; and as this latter image has been shown to move in the\r\ndirection =_b_ β=, with twice the velocity of the mirror =B O=, while\r\nthe mirror =B O= itself moves towards the image, it follows that the\r\nimage in =α O β= will move with a velocity four times that of the\r\nmirror. The same reasoning may be extended to any number of sectors,\r\nand it will be found that in the semicircle =M _b e_=, containing the\r\nfixed mirror,\r\n\r\n    The      {2 and 3}                           2} times the\r\n    images   {4 and 5}   reflexions, move with   4} velocity of\r\n    formed   {6 and 7}                           8} the mirror;\r\n    by       {8 and 9}                          16}\r\n\r\nwhereas in the semicircle =M _a e_=, containing the movable mirror,—\r\n\r\n    The      {1 and 2}                           2 { times the\r\n    images   {3 and 4}  reflexions, move with    4 { velocity of\r\n    formed   {5 and 6}                           8 { the mirror;\r\n    by       {7 and 8}                           16{\r\n\r\na progression which may be continued to any length.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding this chapter, it may be proper to mention a very\r\nremarkable effect produced by moving the two plain mirrors along one of\r\ntwo lines placed at right angles to each other. When the aperture of\r\nthe mirrors is crossed by each of the two lines, the figure created by\r\nreflexion consists of two polygons with salient and re-entering angles.\r\nBy moving the mirrors along one of the lines, so that it may always\r\ncross the aperture at the same angle, and at the same distance from the\r\nangular point, the polygon formed by this line will remain stationary,\r\nand of the same form and magnitude; but the polygon formed by the\r\nother line, at first emerging from the centre, will gradually increase\r\ntill its salient angles touch the re-entering angles of the stationary\r\npolygon; the salient angles becoming more acute, will enclose the\r\napices of the re-entering angles of the stationary polygon, and at last\r\nthe polygon will be destroyed by truncations from its salient angles.\r\n\r\nWhen the lines cross each other at a right angle, the salient angles\r\nof the opening polygon can never touch the salient angles of the\r\nstationary polygon, but always its re-entering angles. If the lines,\r\nhowever, form a less angle than the complement of the angle formed\r\nby the mirrors, then the salient angles of the opening polygon may\r\ntouch the salient angles of the stationary polygon, by placing the\r\nmirrors so as to form re-entering angles in the polygon. When the\r\nlines form an angle between 90° and the complement of the angle formed\r\nby the mirrors, the salient angle of the opening polygon may be made\r\nto touch the salient angles of the stationary one, but in this case\r\nthe stationary polygon can have no re-entering angles. The preceding\r\neffects are finely exemplified by the use of a Kaleidoscope with a\r\ndraw-tube and lens described in Chapter X., and by employing the\r\nvertical and horizontal bars of a window, which may be set at different\r\nangles, by viewing them in perspective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n    ON THE EFFECTS PRODUCED UPON THE SYMMETRY OF THE\r\n        PICTURE BY VARYING THE POSITION OF THE EYE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been taken for granted in the preceding chapters, not only that\r\nthe object seen by direct vision is in a state of perfect junction\r\nwith the images of it formed by reflexion; but that the object and\r\nits images have the same apparent magnitude, and nearly the same\r\nintensity of light. As these conditions are absolutely necessary to the\r\nproduction of symmetrical and beautiful forms, and may be all effected\r\nby particular methods of construction, we shall proceed to investigate\r\nthe principles upon which these methods are founded, in so far as the\r\nposition of the eye is concerned.\r\n\r\nWhen any object is made to touch a common looking-glass in one or more\r\npoints, the reflected image does not touch the object in these points,\r\nbut is always separated from it by a space equal to the thickness\r\nof the glass, in consequence of the reflexion being performed by\r\nthe posterior surface of the mirror. The image and the object must\r\ntherefore be always disunited; and as the interval of separation must\r\nbe interposed between all the reflected images, there cannot possibly\r\nexist that union of forms which constitutes the very essence of\r\nsymmetry. In mirror-glass there is a series of images reflected from\r\nthe _first_ surface, which unite perfectly with the object, and with\r\none another. When the angles of incidence are not great, this series\r\nof images is very faint, and does not much interfere with the more\r\nbrilliant images formed by the metallic surface. As the angles of\r\nincidence increase, the one series of images destroys the effect of the\r\nother, from their overlapping or imperfect coincidence—an effect which\r\nincreases with the thickness of the glass; but when the reflexions are\r\nmade at very oblique incidences, the images formed by the metallic\r\nsurface become almost invisible, while those formed by the first\r\nsurface are as brilliant and nearly as perfect as if the effect of the\r\nposterior metallic surface had been entirely removed. In the following\r\nobservations, therefore, it is understood that the images are reflected\r\neither from a polished metallic surface, or from the first surface of\r\nglass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.]\r\n\r\nIn order to explain the effects produced upon the symmetry of the\r\npicture by a variation in the position of the eye, we must suppose the\r\nobject to be placed at a small distance from the end of the mirror.\r\nThis position is represented in Fig. 13, where =A E= is a section of\r\nthe mirror in the direction of its length; =M N O P= an object placed\r\nat a distance from the extremity =A= of the mirror, and _m n o p_,\r\nits image seen by an eye to the right hand of =E=, and which, by the\r\nprinciples of catoptrics, will be similar to the object and similarly\r\nsituated with respect to the mirror =A E=. Now, if the eye is placed at\r\nε, it will see distinctly the whole object =M N O P=, but it will only\r\nsee the portion _n r s o_ of the image cut off by drawing the line =ε\r\nA _r_= through the extremity of the mirror, so that there cannot be a\r\nsymmetrical form produced by observing at the same time the object =M\r\nN O P= and this portion of its image; and the deviation from symmetry\r\nwill be still greater, if =M N O P= is brought nearer the line =B A=,\r\nfor the image _m n o p_ will be entirely included between the lines =A\r\n_r_= and =A B=, so that no part whatever of the image will be visible\r\nto an eye at =ε=. As the eye of the observer moves from ε to _e_, the\r\nline =ε A _r_= will move into the position =_e_ A _x_=, and when it has\r\nreached the point =e=, the whole of the image _m n o p_ will be visible.\r\nThe symmetry, therefore, arising from the simultaneous contemplation\r\nof the object and its image will be improved; but it will still be\r\nimperfect, as the image will appear to be distant from the plane of the\r\nmirror, only by the space _m x_, while the distance of the object is\r\n=M _x_=. As the eye moves from =_e_= to =E=, the line =_e_ A _x_= will\r\nmove into =E A B=, and the object and its image will seem to be placed\r\nat the equal distances =M B=, =_m_ B= from the plane of the mirror,\r\nand will therefore form a symmetrical combination. When the object is\r\nmoved, and arrives at =B A= the image will touch the object, and they\r\nwill form one perfect and united whole, whatever be the shape of the\r\nline =M P=. Hence we conclude, _that when an object is placed at a\r\nlittle distance from the extremity of a plain mirror, its image formed\r\nby reflexion from the mirror cannot unite with the object in forming a\r\nconjoined and symmetrical picture, unless the eye is in the plane of\r\nthe mirror_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.]\r\n\r\nWhen two mirrors, therefore, are combined, as in Fig. 14, the eye\r\nmust be in the plane of both, in order that the object and its image\r\nmay have a symmetrical coincidence, and therefore it must be at the\r\npoint =E= where the two planes cut each other. The necessity of this\r\nposition, and the effects of any considerable deviation from it, will\r\nbe understood from Fig. 14, where =A O B= is the angle formed by the\r\nmirrors, and =M N= the place of the object. Then if the eye is placed\r\nat ε, the aperture =A O B= will be projected into =_a b_ ω= upon a\r\nplane passing through =M N= and at right angles to =E Oʹ=; but the\r\northographic projection of =A B O= upon the same plane is =Aʹ Bʹ Oʹ=,\r\nor, what is the same thing, the reflecting surfaces of which =A O=, =B\r\nO= are sections, will, when prolonged, cut the plane passing through\r\n=M N= in the lines =Aʹ Oʹ=, =Bʹ Oʹ=; hence, rays from the objects\r\nsituated between =Aʹ Oʹ Bʹ= and =_a_ ω _b_= cannot fall upon the\r\nmirrors =A O E=, =B O E=, or images of these objects cannot be formed\r\nby the mirrors. The images, therefore, in the different sectors formed\r\nby reflexion round =O= as a centre, cannot include any objects without\r\n=Aʹ Oʹ Bʹ=; and since the eye at ε sees all the objects between =Aʹ Oʹ\r\nBʹ= and =_a_ ω _b_=, there can be no symmetry and uniformity in the\r\npicture formed by the combination of such an object with the images\r\nin the sectors. When the eye descends to _e_, the aperture =A O B=\r\nis projected into =_aʹ oʹ bʹ_=, which approaches nearer to =A O B=;\r\nbut for the reasons already assigned, the symmetry of the picture is\r\nstill imperfect. As the eye descends, the lines =_aʹ oʹ_, _bʹ oʹ_=\r\napproach to =Aʹ Oʹ=, =Bʹ Oʹ=, and when the eye arrives at =E=, a point\r\nin the plane of both the reflecting surfaces, the projection of the\r\naperture =A O B= will be =Aʹ Oʹ Bʹ=, and the images in all the sectors\r\nwill be exactly similar to the object presented to the aperture.\r\nHence we conclude in general, _that when an object is placed at any\r\ndistance before two mirrors inclined at an angle, which is an even\r\naliquot part of 360°, the symmetry of the picture is perfect, when the\r\neye, considered as a mathematical point, is placed at_ =E=, and that\r\n_the deviation from symmetry increases as the eye recedes from_ =E=\r\n_towards_ =ε=.\r\n\r\nIf the object were a mathematical surface, all the parts of which were\r\nin contact with the extremities =A O=, =B O= of the mirrors, then it is\r\neasy to see that the symmetry of the picture will not be affected by\r\nthe deviation of the eye from the point =E=, and, in consequence of the\r\nenlargement of the sector, seen by direct vision. The symmetry of the\r\npicture, is, however, affected in another way, by the deviation of the\r\neye from the point =E=.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen, that, in order to possess perfect symmetry, an\r\nobject must consist of two parts in complete contact, one of which is\r\nan inverted image of the other. But in order that an object possessing\r\nperfect symmetry may appear perfectly symmetrical, four conditions\r\nare required. The two halves of the object must be so placed with\r\nrespect to the eye of the observer, that no part of the one half shall\r\nconceal any part of the other; that whatever parts of the one half\r\nare seen, the corresponding parts of the other must also be seen;\r\nand that the corresponding parts of both halves, and both halves\r\nthemselves, must subtend the same angle at the eye. When we stand\r\nbefore a looking-glass, and hold out one hand so as to touch it, the\r\nhand will be found to conceal various parts of its image; and, in\r\nsome positions of the eye, the whole image will be concealed, so that\r\na symmetrical picture cannot possibly be formed by the union of the\r\ntwo. If the eye is placed so obliquely to the looking-glass, that the\r\nhand no longer interferes with its image, it will still be seen, that\r\nparts of the hand which are not directly visible, are visible in its\r\nreflected image, and therefore that a symmetrical picture cannot be\r\ncreated by the union of two parts apparently dissimilar. If the eye of\r\nthe observer is placed near his hand, so that he can see distinctly\r\nboth the hand and its image, the angular magnitude of his hand is much\r\ngreater than that of its image; and therefore, when the two are united,\r\nthey cannot form a symmetrical object. This will be better understood\r\nfrom Fig. 15. When the eye is placed at ε, the object =M N O P= is\r\nobviously nearer than its image _m n o p_, and must therefore appear\r\nlarger; and this difference in their apparent magnitudes will increase\r\nas the eye rises above the plane of the mirror =A E=. As the eye\r\napproaches to =E=, the distances of the object and its image approach\r\nto an equality; and when the eye is at =E=, the object =M N O P=, and\r\nits image _m n o p_, are situated at exactly the same distance from the\r\neye, and therefore have the same angular magnitude. Hence it follows,\r\nthat when they are united, they will form a perfectly symmetrical\r\ncombination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.]\r\n\r\nWhen the eye is placed in the plane of both the mirrors, the field of\r\nview arising from the multiplication of the sector =A O B=, Fig. 14,\r\nwill be perfectly circular; but as the eye rises above the plane of\r\nboth the mirrors, this circle will become a sort of ellipse, becoming\r\nmore and more eccentric as the eye comes in front of the mirrors, or\r\nrises in the direction =E ε=. If the observer were infinitely distant,\r\nthese figures would be correct ellipses; but as the eye, particularly\r\nwhen the mirrors are broad, must be nearly twice as far from the last\r\nreflected sector as from the sector seen by direct vision, the field\r\nof view, and consequently every pattern which it contains, must be\r\ndistorted and destitute of beauty, from this cause alone.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have alluded only to symmetry of form, but it is manifest\r\nthat before the union of two similar forms can give pleasure to the\r\neye, there must be also a symmetry of light. If the object =M N O P=,\r\nFig. 15, is white, and its image _m n o p_ black, they cannot possibly\r\nform, by their combination, an agreeable picture. As any considerable\r\ndifference in the intensity of the light will destroy the beauty of the\r\npatterns, it becomes a matter of indispensable importance to determine\r\nthe position of the eye, which will give the greatest possible\r\nuniformity to the different images of which the picture is composed.\r\n\r\nIt has been ascertained by the accurate experiments of Bouguer, that\r\nwhen light is reflected perpendicularly from good plate glass, only 25\r\nrays are reflected out of 1000; that is, the intensity of the light of\r\nany object seen perpendicularly in plate glass, is to the intensity\r\nof the light of its image as 1000 to 25, or as 40 is to 1. When the\r\nangle of incidence is 60°, the number of reflected rays is 112, and the\r\nintensities are nearly as 9 to 1.—When the angle of incidence is 87½°,\r\nthe number of reflected rays is 584, and the intensities are nearly\r\nas 17 to 10, so that the luminousness of the object and its image\r\napproach rapidly to an equality. It is therefore clear, that, in order\r\nto have the greatest uniformity of light in the different images which\r\ncompose the figure, the eye must be placed as nearly as possible in the\r\nplane of both the mirrors, that is, as near as possible to the angular\r\npoint.—But as it is impracticable to have the eye exactly in the plane\r\nof both mirrors, the images formed by one reflexion must always be\r\nless bright than the direct object, even at the part nearly in contact\r\nwith the object. The second and third reflexions, etc., where the rays\r\nfall with less obliquity, will be still darker than the first; though\r\nthis difference will not be very perceptible when the inclination of\r\nthe mirrors is 30° or upwards, and the eye placed in the position\r\nalready described.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious circumstance, that the positions of the eye which are\r\nnecessary to effect a complete union of the images—to represent similar\r\nparts of the object and its images—to observe the object and its image\r\nunder the same angular magnitude, and to give a maximum intensity of\r\nlight to the reflected images—should all unite in the same point. Had\r\nthis not been the case, the construction of the Kaleidoscope would have\r\nbeen impracticable, and hence it will be seen how vain is the attempt\r\nto produce beautiful and symmetrical forms from any combination of\r\nplain mirrors in which this position of the eye is not a radical and\r\nessential principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n    ON THE EFFECTS PRODUCED UPON THE SYMMETRY OF THE\r\n        PICTURE BY VARYING THE POSITION OF THE OBJECT.\r\n\r\nHaving ascertained the proper position of the eye, we shall now proceed\r\nto determine the position of the object.\r\n\r\nIf the object is placed within the reflectors at any point =D=, Fig.\r\n16, between their object end =O=, and their eye-end =E=, a perfectly\r\nsymmetrical picture will obviously be formed from it; but the centre of\r\nthis picture will not be at =O=, the centre of the luminous sectors,\r\nbut at the point =D=, where the object is placed, or its projection\r\n_d_, so that we shall have a circular luminous field enclosing an\r\neccentric circular pattern. Such a position of the object is therefore\r\nentirely unfit for the production of a symmetrical picture, unless the\r\nobject should be such as wholly to exclude the view of the circular\r\nfield, formed by the reflected images of the aperture =A O B=.\r\n\r\nAs the point =D= approaches to =O=, the centre _d_ of the symmetrical\r\npicture will approach to =O=, and when =D= coincides with =O=, the\r\ncentre of the picture will be at =O=, and all the images of the\r\nobject placed in the plane =A O B= will be similarly disposed in all\r\nthe sectors which compose the circular field of view. Hence we may\r\nconclude, that a perfectly symmetrical pattern cannot be exhibited\r\nin the circular field of view, when the object is placed between =O=\r\nand =E=, or anywhere within the reflectors. If the eye could be placed\r\nexactly at the angular point =E=, so that every point of the line =E O=\r\nshould be projected upon =O=, then the images would be symmetrically\r\narranged round =O=; but this is obviously impossible, for the object\r\nwould, in such circumstances, cease to become visible when this\r\ncoincidence took place. But independent of the eccentricity of the\r\npattern, the position of the object within the mirrors prevents that\r\nmotion of the objects, without which a variation of the pattern cannot\r\nbe produced. An object between the reflectors must always be exposed\r\nto view, and we cannot restrict our view to one-half, one-third, or\r\none-fourth of it, as when we have it in our power to move the objects\r\nacross the aperture, or the aperture over the objects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.]\r\n\r\nAnother evil arising from the placing of the objects within the\r\nmirrors, is, that we are prevented from giving them the proper degree\r\nof illumination which is so essential to the distinctness of the last\r\nreflexions. The portions of the mirrors, too, beyond the objects, or\r\nthose between =D= and =O=, are wholly unnecessary, as they are not\r\nconcerned in the formation of the picture. Hence it follows, that the\r\neffects of the Kaleidoscope cannot be produced by any combination of\r\nmirrors, in which the objects are placed within them.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider what will happen, by removing the object beyond\r\nthe plane passing through =A O B=. In this case the pattern will lose\r\nits symmetry from two causes. In the first place, it is manifest, as\r\nalready explained, that as the eye is necessarily raised a little above\r\nthe point =E=, and also above the planes =A O E=, =B O E=, it must see\r\nthrough the aperture =A O B= a portion of the object situated below\r\nboth of these planes. This part of the object will therefore appear\r\nto project beyond the point, or below the plane where the direct and\r\nreflected images meet. If we suppose, therefore, that all the reflected\r\nimages were symmetrical, the whole picture would lose its symmetry in\r\nconsequence of the irregularity of the sector =A O B= seen by direct\r\nvision. But this supposition is not correct; for since the image _m\r\nn_, Fig. 3, seen by direct vision does not coincide with the first\r\nreflected images _mnʹ_, _nmʹ_, it is clear that all the other images\r\nwill likewise be incoincident, and, therefore, that the figure formed\r\nby their combination must lose its symmetry, and, consequently, its\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nAs the eye must necessarily be placed above a line perpendicular to the\r\nplane =A B O= at the point =O=, it will see a portion of the object\r\nsituated below that perpendicular continued to the object. Thus, in\r\nFig. 16, if the eye is placed at _e_ above =E=, and if =M N= is the\r\nobject placed at the distance =P O=, then the eye at _e_ will observe\r\nthe portion =P Oʹ= of the object situated below the axis =P O E=, and\r\nthis portion, which may be called the aberration, will vary with the\r\nheight =E _e_= of the eye, and with the distance =O P= of the object.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.]\r\n\r\nLet us now suppose =E _e_= and =O P= to be constant, and that a\r\npolygonal figure is formed by some line placed at the point =Q= of the\r\nobject =M N=. Then if =P Q= is very great compared with =P Oʹ=, the\r\npolygonal figure will be tolerably regular, though all its angles will\r\nexhibit an imperfect junction, and its lower half will be actually,\r\nthough not very perceptibly, less than its upper half. But if =Q=\r\napproaches to =P=, =P Oʹ= remaining the same, so that =P Oʹ= bears a\r\nconsiderable ratio to =P Q=, then the polygonal figure will lose all\r\nsymmetry, the upper sectors being decidedly the largest, and the lowest\r\nsectors the smallest. When =Q= arrives near =P=, the aberration becomes\r\nenormous, and the figure is so distorted, that it can no longer be\r\nrecognised as a polygon.\r\n\r\nThe deviation from symmetry, therefore, arising from the removal\r\nof the object from the extremity of the reflectors, increases as\r\nthe object approaches to the centre of the luminous sectors or the\r\ncircular field, and this deviation becomes so perceptible, that an eye\r\naccustomed to observe and admire the symmetry of the combined objects,\r\nwill instantly perceive it, even when the distance of the object or =P\r\nO= is less than the twentieth part of an inch. When the object is very\r\ndistant, the defect of symmetry is so enormous, that though the object\r\nis seen by direct vision, and in some of the sectors, it is entirely\r\ninvisible in the rest.\r\n\r\nThe principle which we have now explained is of primary importance\r\nin the construction of the Kaleidoscope, and it is only by a careful\r\nattention to it that the instrument can be constructed so as to give\r\nto an experienced and fastidious eye that high delight which it never\r\nfails to derive from the exhibition of forms perfectly symmetrical.\r\n\r\nFrom these observations it follows, that a picture possessed of\r\nmathematical symmetry, cannot be produced unless the object is placed\r\nexactly at the extremity of the reflectors, and that even when this\r\ncondition is complied with, the object itself must consist of lines\r\nall lying in the same plane, and in contact with the reflectors. Hence\r\nit is obvious, that objects whose thickness is perceptible, cannot\r\ngive mathematically symmetrical patterns, for one side of them must\r\nalways be at a certain distance from =O=. The deviation in this case\r\nis, however, so small, that it can scarcely be perceived in objects of\r\nmoderate thickness.\r\n\r\nIn the simple form of the Kaleidoscope, the production of symmetrical\r\npatterns is limited to objects which can be placed close to the\r\naperture =A O B=; but it will be seen in the sequel of this treatise,\r\nthat this limitation may be removed by an optical contrivance, which\r\nextends indefinitely the use and application of the instrument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n    ON THE INTENSITY OF THE LIGHT IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF\r\n        THE FIELD, AND ON THE EFFECTS PRODUCED BY VARYING\r\n        THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF THE REFLECTORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we look through a Kaleidoscope in which the mirrors are placed\r\nat an angle of 18° or 22½°, the eye will perceive a very obvious\r\ndifference in the intensity of the light in different parts of the\r\nfield. If the inclination of the mirrors be about 30°, and the eye\r\nproperly placed near the angular point, the intensity of the light is\r\ntolerably uniform; and a person who is unaccustomed to the comparison\r\nof different lights, will find it extremely difficult to distinguish\r\nthe direct sector from the reflected ones. This difficulty will be\r\nstill greater if the mirrors are made of finely polished steel, or\r\nof the best speculum metal, and the observer will not hesitate in\r\nbelieving that he is looking through a tube whose diameter is equal to\r\nthat of the circular field. This approximation to uniformity in the\r\nintensity of the light in all the sectors, which arises wholly from the\r\ndetermination of the proper position of the eye, is one of the most\r\ncurious and unexpected properties of the Kaleidoscope, and is one which\r\ncould not have been anticipated from any theoretical views, or from\r\nany experimental results obtained from the ancient mode of combining\r\nplain mirrors. It is that property, too, which gives it all its value;\r\nfor, if the eye observed the direct sector with its included objects\r\ndistinguished from all the rest by superior brilliancy, not only would\r\nthe illusion vanish, but the picture itself would cease to afford\r\npleasure, from the want of symmetry in the light of the field.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.]\r\n\r\nBefore we proceed to investigate the effects produced by a variation in\r\nthe length of the reflecting planes, it will be necessary to consider\r\nthe variation of the intensity of the light in different parts of the\r\nreflected sectors. In the direct sector =A O B=, Fig. 2, the intensity\r\nof the light is uniform in every part of its surface; but this is far\r\nfrom being the case in the images formed by reflexion. In Fig. 17, take\r\nany two points _m_, _o_, and draw the lines _m n_, _o p_, perpendicular\r\nto =A O=, and meeting =β O= in _n_ and _p_. Let =O E=, Fig. 18, be a\r\nsection of the reflector =A O= seen edgewise, and let =O _p_=, =O _n_=,\r\nbe taken equal to the lines _m n_, _o p_, or the height of the points\r\n_n_, _p_, above the plane of the reflector =A O=. Make =O R= to =R E=\r\nas =O _p_= is to =E _e_= the constant height of the eye above the\r\nreflecting plane, and =O _r_= to =_r_ E= as =O _n_= to =E _e_=, and the\r\npoints =R, _r_=, will be the points of incidence of the rays issuing\r\nfrom _p_ and _n_; for in this case =O R _p_ = E R _e_=, and =O _r n_ =\r\nE _r e_=. Hence it is obvious, that =E R _e_= is less than =E _r e_=,\r\nand that the rays issuing from _p_, by falling more obliquely upon\r\nthe reflecting surface, will be more copiously reflected. It follows,\r\ntherefore, that the intensity of the light in the reflected sector =A\r\nO β= is not uniform, the lines of equal brightness, or the _isophotal_\r\nlines, as they may be called, being parallel to the reflecting surface\r\n=A O=, and in every sector parallel to the radius, between the given\r\nsector and the reflecting surface by which the sector is formed.\r\n\r\nAs it is easy from the preceding construction to determine the angles\r\nat which the light from any points _m_, _n_, is reflected, when the\r\nlength =O E= of the reflectors, and the position of the eye at =E= is\r\ngiven, we may calculate the intensity of the light in any point of\r\nthe circular field by means of the following table, which shows the\r\nnumber of rays reflected at various angles of incidence, the number\r\nof incident rays being supposed to be 1000. Part of this table was\r\ncomputed by Bouguer for plate glass not quicksilvered, by means of a\r\nformula deduced from his experiments. By the aid of the same formula I\r\nhave extended the table considerably.\r\n\r\n_Table showing the quantity of light reflected at various angles of\r\nincidence from plate glass._\r\n\r\n    +---------------+---------------+\r\n    | Complement of | Rays Reflected|\r\n    |  the Angles   |      out      |\r\n    | of Incidence. |    of 1000.   |\r\n    +---------------+---------------+\r\n    |     2½°       |      584      |\r\n    |     5         |      543      |\r\n    |     7         |      474      |\r\n    |     10        |      412      |\r\n    |     12½       |      356      |\r\n    |     15        |      299      |\r\n    |     20        |      222      |\r\n    |     21        |      210      |\r\n    |     25        |      157      |\r\n    |     26        |      149      |\r\n    |     30        |      112      |\r\n    |     31        |      105      |\r\n    |     34        |       85      |\r\n    |     35        |       79      |\r\n    |     36        |       74      |\r\n    |     37        |       69      |\r\n    |     38        |       65      |\r\n    |     39        |       61      |\r\n    |     40        |       57      |\r\n    |     46        |       40      |\r\n    |     50        |       34      |\r\n    |     55        |       29      |\r\n    |     60        |       27      |\r\n    |     70        |       25      |\r\n    |     80        |       25      |\r\n    |     90        |       25      |\r\n    +---------------+---------------+\r\n\r\nIn order to explain the method of using the table, let us suppose that\r\nthe angle of incidence, or =O R _p_=, Fig. 19, is 85°: then the number\r\nof rays in the corresponding point π of the reflected sector =A O _b_=\r\n(Fig. 17) will be 543. By letting fall perpendiculars from the points\r\nμ, π, upon the mirror =B O=, and taking =O _p_=, =O _n_=, Fig. 19,\r\nequal to these perpendiculars, we may ascertain the angles at which the\r\nlight from the points μ, π, suffer a second reflexion from the mirror\r\n=B O=. Let the angle for the point π be 10°, then the number of rays\r\nout of 1000 reflected at this angle, according to the table, is 412;\r\nbut as the number of rays emanating from π, and incident upon =B O=, is\r\nnot 1000, but only 543, we must say as 1000: 412 = 543: 224, the number\r\nof rays reflected from =B O=, or the intensity of the light in a point\r\nin the line =O _bʹ_= corresponding to π.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.]\r\n\r\nThe preceding method of calculation is applicable only with strictness\r\nto the two sectors =A O _b_=, =B O _a_=, formed by one reflexion, for\r\nthe intensity of the light in the other sectors which are formed by\r\nmore than one reflexion, must be affected by the polarization which\r\nthe light experiences after successive reflexions; for light which has\r\nacquired this property is reflected according to laws different from\r\nthose which regulate the reflexion of direct light.\r\n\r\nWhen the mirrors are metallic, the quantity of reflected light is also\r\naffected by its polarization, but it is regulated by more complicated\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nIn Kaleidoscopes made of plates of glass, the last reflected image\r\n=β O ω=, Fig. 2, is more polarized than any of the rest, and is\r\npolarized in a plane perpendicular to =X E=, or in the same manner as\r\nif it had been reflected at the polarizing angle from a vertical plane\r\nparallel to =X E=.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.]\r\n\r\nLet us now consider what will take place by a variation in the length\r\nof the reflecting planes, the angular extent of the field of view\r\nremaining always the same. If =A O E=, =A O Eʹ=, Fig. 20, be two\r\nreflecting plates of the same breadth =A O=, but of different lengths,\r\nit is manifest that the light which forms the direct sector must be\r\nincident nearer the perpendicular, or reflected at less obliquities in\r\nthe short plate than in the long one, and, therefore, that a similarly\r\nsituated point in the circular field of the shorter instrument, will\r\nhave less intensity of light than a similarly situated point in a\r\nlarger instrument. But in this case, the field of view in the short\r\ninstrument is proportionally enlarged, so that the comparison between\r\nthe two is incorrect. When the long and the short instrument have equal\r\napparent apertures, which will be the case when the plates are =A O E=,\r\n=Aʹ O Eʹ=, then similarly situated points of the two fields will have\r\nexactly the same intensity of light.\r\n\r\nThis will be better understood from Fig. 19, where =O E= may represent\r\nthe long reflector and =Oʹ E= the short one. Then, if these two have\r\nexactly the same aperture, or a circular field of the same angular\r\nmagnitude, the rays of light which flow from two given points, _p_,\r\n_n_, of the long instrument, will be reflected at a certain angle\r\nfrom the points =R=, _r_; but as the points _pʹ_, _nʹ_, are the\r\ncorresponding points in the field of the shorter instrument, the rays\r\nwhich issue from them will be reflected at the same angles from the\r\npoints =R=, _r_, the eye being in both cases placed at the same point\r\n_e_. Hence it is obvious, that the quantity of reflected light will\r\nin both cases be the same, and, therefore, that there is no peculiar\r\nadvantage to be derived, in so far as the light of the field is\r\nconcerned, by increasing the length of the reflectors, unless we raise\r\nthe eye above _e_, till every part of the pupil receives the reflected\r\nrays.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one advantage, and a very important one, to be\r\nderived from an increase of length in the mirrors, namely a diminution\r\nof the deviation from symmetry which arises from the small height of\r\nthe eye above the plane of the mirrors, and of the small distance\r\nof the objects from the extremity of the mirrors. As the height of\r\nthe eye must always be a certain quantity, =E _e_=, Fig. 17, above\r\nthe angular point =E=, whatever be the length of the reflectors, it\r\nis obvious, that when the length of the reflectors is =_e_ O=, the\r\ndeviation from symmetry will be only =P _oʹ_=, whereas when the length\r\nof the reflectors is reduced to =_eʹ_ O=, the height of the eye =_eʹ_\r\nEʹ= being still equal to =_e_ E=, the aberration will be increased\r\nto =P _o_=. This advantage is certainly of considerable consequence;\r\nbut in practice the difficulty of constructing a perfect instrument,\r\nincreases with the length of the reflectors. When the plates are long,\r\nit is more difficult to get the surface perfectly flat; the risk of a\r\nbending in the plates is also increased, which creates the additional\r\ndifficulty of forming a good junction, on which the excellence of the\r\ninstrument so much depends. By augmenting the length of the reflectors,\r\nthe quantity of dust which collects between them is also increased,\r\nand it is then very difficult to remove this dust, without taking the\r\ninstrument to pieces. From these causes it is advisable to limit the\r\ngreatest length of the reflectors to seven or eight inches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nON THE CONSTRUCTION AND USE OF THE SIMPLE KALEIDOSCOPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to construct the Kaleidoscope in its most simple form, we\r\nmust procure two reflectors, about five, six, seven, or eight inches\r\nlong. These reflectors may be either rectangular plates, or plates\r\nshaped like those represented in Fig. 1, having their broadest ends\r\n=A O=, =B O=, from one to two inches wide, and their narrowest ends\r\n=_a_ E=, =_b_ E=, half an inch wide. If the reflectors are of glass,\r\nthe newest plate glass should be used, as a great deal of light is\r\nlost by employing old plate glass, with scratches or imperfections\r\nupon its surface. The plate glass may be either quicksilvered or not,\r\nor its posterior surface may be ground, or covered with black wax, or\r\nblack varnish, or anything else that removes its reflective power.\r\nThis, however, is by no means absolutely necessary, for if the eye\r\nis properly placed, the reflexions from the posterior surface will\r\nscarcely affect the distinctness of the picture, unless in very intense\r\nlights. If it should be thought necessary to extinguish, as completely\r\nas possible, all extraneous light that may be thrown into the tube\r\nfrom the posterior surface of the glass plates, that surface should be\r\ncoated with a varnish of the same refractive and dispersive power as\r\nthe glass.\r\n\r\nIf the plates of glass have been skilfully cut with the diamond, so as\r\nto have their edges perfectly straight, and free from chips, two of\r\nthe edges may be placed together, as in Fig. 17 (p. 49), or one edge\r\nof one plate may be placed against the surface of the other plate, as\r\nshown in the section of Mr. Bates’s Kaleidoscope. But if the edges are\r\nrough and uneven, one of them may be made quite straight, and freed\r\nfrom all imperfections, by grinding it upon a flat surface, with very\r\nfine emery, or with the powder scraped from a hone. When the two plates\r\nare laid together, so as to form a perfect junction, they are then to\r\nbe placed in a brass or any other tube, so as to form an angle of 45°,\r\n36°, 30°, or any even aliquot part of a circle. In order to do this\r\nwith perfect accuracy, direct the tube containing the reflectors to\r\nany line, such as _m n_, Fig. 2, placed very obliquely to one of the\r\nreflectors =A O=, and open or shut the plates till the figure of a star\r\nis formed, composed of 8, 10, or 12 sectors, or with 4, 5, or 6 points,\r\ncorresponding to angles of 45°, 36°, and 30°. When all the points of\r\nthe star are equally perfect, and none of the lines which form the\r\nsalient and re-entering angles disunited, the reflectors must be fixed\r\nin that position by small arches of brass or wood =A B=, =_a b_=, Fig.\r\n21, filed down till they exactly fit the space between the open ends of\r\nthe plates. The plates must then be kept in this position by pieces or\r\nwedges of cork or wood, or any other substance pushed between them and\r\nthe tube. The greatest care, however, must be taken that these wedges\r\npress lightly upon the reflectors, for a very slight force is capable\r\nof bending and altering the figure even of very thick plates of glass.\r\n\r\nWhen the reflectors are thus placed in the tube, as in Fig. 21, their\r\nextremities =_a_ E=, =_b_ E=, next the eye, must reach to the very end\r\nof the tube, as it is of the greatest importance that the eye get as\r\nnear as possible to the reflectors. The other ends of the reflectors\r\n=A O=, =B O=, must also extend to the other extremity of the tube, in\r\norder that they may be brought into contact with the objects which are\r\nto be applied to the instrument. In using transparent objects the cell\r\nor box which contains them may be screwed into the end of the tube, so\r\nas to reach the ends of the reflectors, if they happen to terminate\r\nwithin the tube; but an instrument thus constructed is incapable of\r\nbeing applied to opaque objects, or to transparent objects seen by\r\nreflected light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.]\r\n\r\nIf the plates are narrower at the eye-end, as in Fig. 21, the angular\r\npoint =E= should be a little on one side of the axis of the tube, in\r\norder that the aperture in the centre of the brass cap next the eye\r\nmay be brought as near as possible to =E=. When the plates have the\r\nsame breadth at both ends, the angular point =E= will be near the\r\nlower circumference of the tube, as it is at =O=; and in this case it\r\nis necessary to place the eye-hole out of the centre, so as to be a\r\nlittle above the angular point =E=. This construction is less elegant\r\nthan the preceding; but it has the advantage of giving more room for\r\nthe introduction of a feather, or a piece of thin wood covered with\r\nleather, for the purpose of removing the dust which is constantly\r\naccumulating between the reflectors. In some instances the plates have\r\nbeen put together in such a manner that they may be taken out of the\r\ntube, for the purpose of being cleaned; but though this construction\r\nhas its advantages, yet it requires some ingenuity to replace the\r\nreflectors with facility, and to fix them at the exact inclination\r\nwhich is required. One of the most convenient methods is to support the\r\nreflector in a groove cut out of a solid cylinder of dry wood of nearly\r\nthe same diameter as the tube; and after a slip of wood, or any other\r\nsubstance, is placed along the open edges of the plates, to keep them\r\nat the proper angle given by the groove, the whole is slipped into the\r\ntube, where it remains firm and secure from all accident.\r\n\r\nIf the length of the reflectors is less than the shortest distance at\r\nwhich the eye is capable of seeing objects with perfect distinctness,\r\nit will be necessary to place at the eye-end =E= a convex lens, whose\r\nfocal length is equal to, or an inch or two greater than, the length\r\nof the reflectors. By this means the observer will see with perfect\r\ndistinctness the objects placed at the object end of the Kaleidoscope.\r\nThis lens, however, must be removed when the instrument is to be used\r\nby persons who are short-sighted.\r\n\r\nThe proper application of the objects at the end of the reflectors\r\nis now the only step which is required to complete the simple\r\nKaleidoscope. The method of forming, selecting, and mixing the objects,\r\nwill be described in the next chapter. At present, we shall confine our\r\nattention to the various methods which may be employed in applying them\r\nto the end of the reflectors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.]\r\n\r\nThe first and most simple method consists in bringing the tube about\r\nhalf an inch beyond the ends of the reflectors. A circular piece of\r\nthin plane glass of the same diameter as the tube, is then pushed into\r\nthe tube, so as to touch the reflectors. The pieces of coloured glass\r\nbeing laid upon this piece of glass when the tube is held in a vertical\r\nposition, another similar disc of plane glass, having its outer surface\r\nground with fine emery, is next placed above the glass fragments, being\r\nprevented from pressing upon them, or approaching too near the first\r\nplane glass by a ring of copper or brass; and is kept in its place\r\nby burnishing down the end of the tube. The eye being placed at the\r\nother end of the instrument, the observer turns the whole round in\r\nhis hand, and perceives an infinite variety of beautiful figures and\r\npatterns, in consequence of the succession of new fragments, which are\r\nbrought opposite the aperture by their own gravity, and by the rotatory\r\nmotion of the tube. In this rude state, however, the instrument is by\r\nno means susceptible of affording very pleasing exhibitions. A very\r\ndisagreeable effect is produced by bringing the darkest sectors, or\r\nthose formed by the greatest number of reflexions, to the upper part\r\nof the circular field, and though the variety of patterns will be very\r\ngreat, yet the instrument is limited to the same series of fragments,\r\nand cannot be applied to the numerous objects which are perpetually\r\npresenting themselves to our notice. These evils can be removed only\r\nby adopting the construction shown in Fig. 22, in which the reflectors\r\nreach the very end of the tube. Upon the end of the tube _a b_, _c\r\nd_, Fig. 22, is placed a ring of brass, _m n_, which moves easily upon\r\nthe tube _a b c d_, and is kept in its place by a shoulder of brass\r\non each side of it. A brass cell, =M N=, is then made to slip tightly\r\nupon the moveable ring _m n_, so that when the cell is turned round by\r\nmeans of the milled end at =M N=, the ring _m n_ may move freely upon\r\nthe tube. The fragments of coloured glass, etc., are now placed in a\r\nsmall object-box, as it may be called, consisting of two glasses, the\r\ninnermost of which, _m n_, is transparent, and the other ground on\r\nthe outside =P=, and kept at the distance of ⅛th or ⅒th of an inch by\r\na brass rim: this brass rim generally consists of two pieces, which\r\nscrew into one another, so that the object-plate can be opened by\r\nunscrewing it, and the fragments changed at pleasure. This object-box\r\nis placed at the bottom of the cell =M N=, as shown at =O P=, and the\r\ndepth of the cell is such as to allow the side =O= to touch the end\r\nof the reflectors, when the cell is slipped upon the ring _m n_. When\r\nthis is done, the instrument is held in one hand with the angular point\r\n=E=, Fig. 21, downwards, which is known by a mark on the upper side\r\nof the tube between _a_ and _b_, and the cell is turned round with\r\nthe other hand, so as to present different fragments of the included\r\nglass before the aperture =A O B=. The tube may be directed to the\r\nbrightest part of the sky in the day-time, or in the evening to a\r\ncandle, or an Argand Lamp, so as to transmit the light directly through\r\nthe coloured fragments; but it will always be found to give richer and\r\nmore brilliant effects if the tube is directed to the window-shutter,\r\na little to one side of the light, or is held to one side of the\r\ncandle—or, what is still better, between two candles or lamps placed\r\nas near each other as possible. In this way the picture created by the\r\ninstrument is not composed of the harsh tints formed by transmitted\r\nlight; but of the various reflected and softened colours which are\r\nthrown into the tube from the sides and angles of the glass fragments.\r\nWhen the pattern remains fixed in any position of the instrument, a\r\nvariety of beautiful changes may be effected by making the end of the\r\ntube revolve round a candle or a bright gas flame, placed near the\r\nobject-plate. The general pattern remains the same, but its colours\r\nvary both in their position and intensity, as the light falls upon\r\ndifferent sides of the fragments of glass.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding method of applying the objects to the reflectors,\r\nthe fragments of coloured glass are introduced before the aperture,\r\nand pass across it in concentric circles; and as the fragments always\r\ndescend by their own gravity, the changes in the picture, though\r\ninfinite in number, constantly take place in a similar manner. This\r\ndefect may be remedied, and a great degree of variety exhibited in\r\nthe motion of the fragments, by making the object-plates rectangular\r\ninstead of circular, and moving them through a groove cut in the cell\r\nat =M N=, in the same manner as is done with the pictures or sliders\r\nfor the magic lantern and solar microscope. By this means the different\r\nfragments that present themselves to the aperture may be made to pass\r\nacross it in every possible direction, and very interesting effects may\r\nbe produced by a combination of the rotatory and rectilineal motions of\r\nthe object-plate. When the object or objects are fixed, and the tube\r\nwith the reflectors moved round a centre, as described in Chapter\r\nII.,[3] we have the same succession of symmetrical pictures; but in\r\nthis case every alternate sector is stationary, and the same number in\r\nmotion, the moving figures always changing their form, and assuming\r\nthat of the figures in the stationary sectors, which of course change,\r\nwhile the ends of the mirror pass over the fixed objects.\r\n\r\n[3] See Chapter X.\r\n\r\nWhen the simple Kaleidoscope is applied to opaque objects, such as a\r\nseal, a watch-chain, the seconds hands of a watch, coins, pictures,\r\ngems, shells, flowers, leaves, and petals of plants, impressions\r\nfrom seals, etc., the object, instead of being held between the eye\r\nand the light, must be viewed in the same manner as we view objects\r\nthrough a microscope, being always placed as near the instrument as\r\npossible, and so as to allow the light to fall freely upon the object.\r\nThe object-plates, and all transparent objects, may be viewed in this\r\nmanner; but the most splendid exhibition of this kind is to view minute\r\nfragments of coloured glass, and objects with opaque colours, etc.,\r\nplaced in a flat box, the bottom of which is made of mirror-glass. The\r\nlight reflected from the mirror-glass, and transmitted through the\r\ntransparent fragments, is combined with the light reflected both from\r\nthe transparent and opaque fragments, and forms an effect of the finest\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nAs dust is apt to collect in the angle formed by the reflectors, it may\r\nbe removed when the reflectors are fixed, either by the end of a strong\r\nfeather, or blown away with a pair of bellows. When the dust is lodged\r\nupon the face of the reflectors, it should be removed by a piece of\r\nsoft leather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n    ON THE SELECTION OF OBJECTS FOR THE KALEIDOSCOPE, AND\r\n        ON THE MODE OF CONSTRUCTING THE OBJECT-BOX.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Kaleidoscope is capable of creating beautiful forms\r\nfrom the most ugly and shapeless objects, yet the combinations which\r\nit presents, when obtained from certain shapes and colours, are so\r\nsuperior to those which it produces from others, that no idea can be\r\nformed of the power and effects of the instrument, unless the objects\r\nare judiciously selected.\r\n\r\nWhen the inclination of the reflectors is great, the objects, or the\r\nfragments of coloured glass, should be larger than when the inclination\r\nis small; for when small fragments are presented before a large\r\naperture, the pattern which is created has a spotted appearance, and\r\nderives no beauty from the inversion of the images, in consequence of\r\nthe outline of each separate fragment not joining with the inverted\r\nimage of it.\r\n\r\nThe objects which give the finest outlines by inversion, are those\r\nwhich have a curvilineal form, such as circles, ellipses, looped\r\ncurves like the figure 8, curves like the figure 3 and the letter S;\r\nspirals, and other forms, such as squares, rectangles, and triangles,\r\nmay be applied with advantage. Glass, both spun and twisted, and\r\nof all colours, and shades of colours, should be formed into the\r\npreceding shapes; and when these are mixed with pieces of flat coloured\r\nglass, blue vitriol, native sulphur, yellow orpiment, differently\r\ncoloured fluids, enclosed and moving in small vessels of glass, etc.,\r\nthey will make the finest transparent objects for the Kaleidoscope.\r\nWhen the objects are to be laid upon a mirror plate, fragments of\r\nopaquely-coloured glass should be added to the transparent fragments,\r\nalong with pieces of brass wire, of coloured foils, and grains of\r\nspelter. In selecting transparent objects, the greatest care must be\r\ntaken to reject fragments of opaque glass, and dark colours that do\r\nnot transmit much light; and all the pieces of spun glass, or coloured\r\nplates, should be as thin as possible.\r\n\r\nWhen the objects are thus prepared, the next step is to place them\r\nin the object-box. The distance between the interior surfaces of the\r\ntwo plane glasses, of which the object-plates are generally composed,\r\nshould be as small as possible, not exceeding ⅛th of an inch. The\r\noutermost of these glasses has its external surface rough ground, or\r\nis what is called a _grey glass_, the principal use of which is to\r\nprevent the lines of external objects, such as the bars of the window,\r\nor the outlines of the illuminating flame from being introduced into\r\nthe picture. When a strong light is used, a circular disk of fine thin\r\npaper placed outside of the object-box may be advantageously employed\r\nin place of the ground glass. The thickness of the transparent glass\r\nplate next the reflectors should be just sufficient to keep the glass\r\nfrom breaking; and the interior diameter of the brass rings into which\r\nthe transparent and the grey or ground plates of glass are burnished,\r\nshould be so great that no part of the brass rim may be opposite the\r\nangular part of the reflectors during the rotatory motion of the\r\ncell. If this precaution is not attended to, the central part of the\r\npattern, where the development of new forms is generally the most\r\nbeautiful, will be entirely obliterated by the interposition of the\r\nbrass rim. Instead of using transparent or grey glasses on the sides\r\nof every object-box, some of the boxes should be made with disks of\r\nflint glass, the interior surface of which have been stamped while in\r\na state of fusion with a sort of pattern, or with curved lines of a\r\npleasing form. In others, the outer surface alone of the plate next the\r\nreflectors might be thus formed. An object-box might also be formed\r\nof disks of glass, one side of which is colourless, and the other\r\ncoloured, some of the coloured portions being ground away irregularly,\r\nas in certain Bohemian articles of glass; and the colour in one disk\r\nmay be complementary to that in the other. In object-boxes of this\r\nkind, pieces of coloured glass may also be placed. When the two parts\r\nof the object-boxes thus constructed are screwed or fixed together,\r\nthe box should be nearly two-thirds filled with the mixture of regular\r\nand irregular objects, already mentioned. If they fall with difficulty\r\nduring the rotation of the cell, two or three turns of the screw\r\nbackward, when there is a screw, will relieve them; and if they fall\r\ntoo easily, and accumulate, by slipping behind one another, the space\r\nbetween the glasses may be diminished by placing within the box another\r\nglass in contact with the grey glass.\r\n\r\nWhen the object-box, now described, is placed in the cell, and examined\r\nby the Kaleidoscope, the pictures which it forms are in a state\r\nof perpetual change, and can never be fixed, and shown to another\r\nperson. To obviate this disadvantage, an object-box with fixed objects\r\ngenerally accompanies the instrument; the pieces of spun and coloured\r\nglass are fixed by a transparent cement to the inner side of the\r\nglass of the object-plate, next the eye, so that the patterns are all\r\npermanent, and may be exhibited to others. After the cell has performed\r\na complete rotation, the same patterns again recur, and may therefore\r\nbe at any time recalled at the pleasure of the observer. The same\r\npatterns, it is true, will have a different appearance, if the light\r\nfalls in a different manner upon the objects, but its general character\r\nand outline will, in most cases, remain the same.\r\n\r\nThe object-boxes which have now been described, are made to fit\r\nthe cell, but at the same time to slip easily into it, so that\r\nthey themselves have no motion separate from that of the cell. An\r\nobject-plate, however, of a less diameter, called the vibrating\r\nobject-plate, and containing loose objects, is an interesting addition\r\nto the instrument. When the Kaleidoscope is held horizontally, this\r\nsmall object-plate vibrates on its lower edge, either by a gentle\r\nmotion of the tube, or by striking it slightly with the finger; and the\r\neffect of this vibration is singularly fine, particularly when it is\r\ncombined with the motion of the coloured fragments.\r\n\r\nAnother of the object-boxes, in several of the instruments, contains\r\neither fragments of colourless glass, or an irregular surface of\r\ntransparent varnish or indurated Canada balsam. This object-box gives\r\nvery fine colourless figures when used alone; but its principal use\r\nis to be placed in the cell between an object-box with bright colours\r\nand the end of the instrument. When this is done, the outline of the\r\npieces of coloured glass are softened down by the refraction of the\r\ntransparent fragments, and the pattern displays the finest effects of\r\nsoft and brilliant colouring. The colourless object-box supplies the\r\noutline of the pattern, and the mass of colour behind fills it up with\r\nthe softest tints.\r\n\r\nSome of the object-boxes are filled with iron or brass wires, twisted\r\ninto various forms, and rendered broader and flatter in some places by\r\nhammering. These wires, when intermixed with a few small fragments of\r\ncoloured glass, produce a very fine effect. Other object-plates have\r\nbeen made with pitch, balsam of tolu, gum lac, and thick transparent\r\npaints; and when these substances are laid on with judgment, they\r\nform excellent objects for the Kaleidoscope. Lace has been introduced\r\nwith considerable effect, and also festoons of beads strung upon wire\r\nor thread; but pieces of glass, with cut and polished faces, are ill\r\nfitted for objects. When the object-box is wide, certain insects may\r\nbe introduced temporarily, without killing or injuring them, and\r\nthe crystallization of certain salts from their solution, and other\r\nchemical changes, may be curiously exhibited.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have supposed all colours to be indiscriminately adopted in\r\nthe selection of objects; but it will be found from experience, that\r\nthough the eye is pleased with the combination of various objects,\r\nyet it derives this pleasure from the beauty and symmetry of the\r\noutline, and not from the union of many different tints. Those who are\r\naccustomed to this kind of observation, and who are acquainted with the\r\nprinciples of the harmony of colours, will soon perceive the harshness\r\nof the effect which is produced by the predominance of one colour, by\r\nthe juxtaposition of others, and by the accidental union of a number;\r\nand even those who are ignorant of these principles, will acknowledge\r\nthe superior effect which is obtained by the exclusion of all other\r\ncolours except those which harmonize with each other.\r\n\r\nIn order to enable any person to find what colours harmonize with each\r\nother, I have drawn up the following table, which contains the harmonic\r\ncolours.\r\n\r\n    Deepest Red,       Blue and Green equally mixed.\r\n    Red,               Blue and Green, with most Blue, mixed.\r\n    Orange Red,        Blue mixed with much Indigo.\r\n    Orange,            Blue and Indigo, the Indigo predominating.\r\n    Orange-Yellow,     Indigo unmixed.\r\n    Yellow,            Violet and Indigo nearly in equal portions.\r\n    Greenish Yellow,   Pale Violet.\r\n    Green,             Violet.\r\n    Greenish Blue,     Violet and Red in equal portions.\r\n    Blue,              Orange Red, Red.\r\n    Indigo,            Orange-Yellow.\r\n    Violet,            Green.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the preceding table that _Bluish Green_ harmonizes with\r\n_Red_, or, in other words, _Red_ is said to be the _accidental colour_\r\nof _Bluish Green_, and _vice versa_. These colours are also called\r\n_complementary colours_, because the one is the complement of the\r\nother, or what the other wants of white light; that is, when the two\r\ncolours are mixed, they will always form white by their combination.[4]\r\n\r\n[4] See the article _Accidental Colours_, in the EDINBURGH\r\nENCYCLOPÆDIA, vol. i. p. 88.\r\n\r\nThe following general method of finding the harmonic colours will\r\nenable the reader to determine them for tints not contained in the\r\npreceding table. Let =A B=, Fig. 23, be the prismatic spectrum,\r\ncontaining all the seven colours, namely, _Red_, _Orange_, _Yellow_,\r\n_Green_, _Blue_, _Indigo_, and _Violet_, in the proportion assigned to\r\nthem by Sir Isaac Newton, and marked by the dotted lines. Bisect the =A\r\nB= at _m_, so that =A _m_= is equal to =B _m_=, and let it be required\r\nto ascertain the colour which harmonizes with the colour in the Indigo\r\nspace at the point _p_. Take =A _m_=, and set it from _p_ to _o_,\r\nand the colour opposite _o_, or an orange-yellow, will be that which\r\nharmonizes with the indigo at _p_. If _p_ is between _m_ and =A=, then\r\nthe distance =A _m_= must be set off from _m_ towards _n_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23]\r\n\r\nIn order to show the method of constructing object-boxes on the\r\npreceding principles, we shall suppose that the harmonic colours of\r\norange-yellow and indigo are to be employed. Four or five regular\r\nfigures, such as those already described, must be made out of\r\nindigo-coloured glass, some of them being plain, and others twisted.\r\nThe same number of figures must also be made out of an orange-yellow\r\nglass; and some of these may be drawn of less diameter than others,\r\nin order that tints of various intensities, but of the same colour,\r\nmay be obtained. Some of these pieces of spun glass, of an indigo\r\ncolour, may be intertwisted with fibres of the orange-yellow glass. A\r\nfew pieces of white flint-glass, or crystal spun in a similar manner,\r\nand intertwisted, some with fibres of orange-yellow, and others with\r\nfibres of indigo glass, should be added; and when all these are joined\r\nto some flat fragments of orange-yellow glass, and indigo-coloured\r\nglass, and placed in the object-plate, they will exhibit, when applied\r\nto the Kaleidoscope, the most chaste combinations of forms and colours,\r\nwhich will not only delight the eye by the beauty of their outline,\r\nbut also by the perfect harmony of their tints. By using the thin and\r\nhighly-coloured films or flakes of decomposed glass, very brilliant and\r\nbeautiful patterns are produced. These films may be placed either upon\r\na mirror plate or upon black wax, and they may be placed among other\r\nobjects, or fixed in movable cells. By applying the Kaleidoscope to\r\ncrystals in the act of formation, shooting out in different directions,\r\nsymmetrical patterns are instantaneously created.\r\n\r\nThe effect produced by objects of only one colour is perhaps even\r\nsuperior to the combination of two harmonic colours. In constructing\r\nobject-plates of this kind, various shades of the same colour may be\r\nadopted; and when such objects are mixed with pieces of colourless\r\nglass, twisted and spun, the most chaste and delicate patterns are\r\nproduced; and those eyes which suffer pain from the contemplation of\r\nvarious colours, are able to look without uneasiness upon a pattern in\r\nwhich there is only one.\r\n\r\nIn order to show the power of the instrument, and the extent to which\r\nthese combinations may be carried, I have sometimes constructed a\r\nlong object-plate, like the slider of the magic lantern, in which\r\ncombinations of all the principal harmonic colours followed one another\r\nin succession, and presented to the eye a series of brilliant visions\r\nno less gratifying to some persons, and to some others even more\r\ngratifying, than those successions of musical sounds from which the ear\r\nderives such intense delight.\r\n\r\nWe cannot conclude this chapter without noticing the fine effects which\r\nare produced by the introduction of carved gems, and figures of all\r\nkinds, whether they are drawn or engraved on opaque, or transparent\r\ngrounds. The particular mode of combining these figures will be pointed\r\nout in a subsequent chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nON THE ILLUMINATION OF TRANSPARENT OBJECTS IN THE KALEIDOSCOPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Kaleidoscope is directed to the sky, or to a luminous object,\r\nsuch as a gas flame, or the flame of a candle, a uniform tint is seen\r\nthrough the pieces of glass, or other transparent fragments that\r\nhave flat surfaces, and there is a certain degree of hardness in\r\ntheir outlines. When the instrument is not opposite the flame, but\r\ndirected to one side of it, the light enters the transparent fragments\r\nobliquely, and a much finer effect is produced. The pattern, indeed,\r\nchanges very considerably by making the Kaleidoscope move round the\r\nflame. An excellent effect is obtained, as we have already stated,\r\nby directing the tube between two bright lights; and the richness of\r\nthe symmetrical pattern increases with the number of lights which\r\nilluminate the objects. As it would be inconvenient to adopt such a\r\nmode of illumination, it becomes of importance to have some contrivance\r\nattached to the instrument, by which we can illuminate the objects by\r\nlight falling upon them in different directions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.]\r\n\r\nThe simplest method of thus illuminating the objects, is to fix on the\r\nend of the Kaleidoscope the portion of a metallic or silvered-glass\r\ncone. The light of a bright flame, placed in front of the cone, will\r\nbe reflected from its interior surface, and fall obliquely on the\r\nfragments of coloured glass. In many cases the effect will be increased\r\nby placing in the base or mouth of the cone a circular stop, or opaque\r\ndisk, in order to prevent any light from falling directly upon the\r\nobjects, their oblique illumination being produced solely by the\r\nrays reflected from the interior surface of the cone. This will be\r\nunderstood from the annexed figure, where =M A N C= is a portion of\r\nthe cone, fixed to the end =E F= of the Kaleidoscope, and _m n o p_\r\nthe object-box. If the angle formed by the sides of the cone is such\r\nthat a ray of the sun’s light falling upon =M=, the upper margin of the\r\nreflecting surface of the cone, is reflected to _o_, the lower side\r\nof the object-box, then all the rays of a beam of the sun’s light\r\nincident upon the upper half of the conical surface, will be reflected\r\nupon the object-box; and, for the same reason, if a ray falling on\r\n=N= is reflected to _m_, all the other rays falling on the lower half\r\nof the conical surface will be reflected upon the object-box, and\r\nilluminate obliquely the objects which it contains.\r\n\r\nIn the Kaleidoscopes of more recent construction, the object-box is\r\nmade transparent throughout,—the plates of glass _m n_, _o p_ being\r\nfixed in a cylindrical case of glass _m n o p_, so that rays =R R=,\r\neither parallel or diverging, may be reflected from the cone =A B C D=,\r\nand after passing through the transparent cylindrical rim _m n o p_,\r\nilluminate the objects. Another cone =A M N C=, with its angle less\r\nthan a right angle, may be joined to =A B D C=, so as to throw the rays\r\nobliquely, into _m n_ and _o p_, and also, if desired, upon the front\r\nglass _m o_ of the object-box, the direct rays being excluded by an\r\nopaque disk =S S=. In this construction, the outer face of the glass\r\n_m o_ should not be ground, as it would prevent the admission of the\r\nlight to the objects, the exclusion of external objects, the purpose\r\nfor which the grey glass is required, being effected by the stop =S\r\nS=. The illuminating cone may be of tin, or, what is much better, of\r\nplated copper, which reflects more light than any other metal, and it\r\nmust be so attached to the tube containing the reflectors, as to have a\r\nrotatory motion.\r\n\r\nThe same kind of lateral illumination may be obtained from polyhedral\r\ncones or hemispheres of solid glass. If =A B C D=, Fig. 25, is the\r\nsection of a polyhedral cone of flint or plate glass, a portion _m\r\nn o p_ is cut out of its base =A B=, to form an object-box for the\r\nreception of the pieces of coloured glass, or other objects. The sides\r\n_m n_, _m o_, _o p_, being highly polished, rays of light, either\r\nparallel, as emanating from the sun, or diverging from artificial\r\nsources of light, will be refracted and fall obliquely upon the faces\r\nof the object-box, and illuminate its contents with the irregular\r\nprismatic spectra which are formed by refraction. The apex =D C E= may,\r\nin some cases, be cut off, and the polygonal section =D E= blackened in\r\norder to prevent the introduction of direct light, and act as the stop\r\n=S S= in the preceding figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.]\r\n\r\nA similar effect will be obtained from a polyhedral solid, of a\r\nhemispherical form, as shown in Fig. 26, where =A C=, =C D=, =D E=, =B\r\nF=, =F G=, =G E=, are polished facets, by which parallel or diverging\r\nrays immediately before it, or incident in any lateral direction, may\r\nbe refracted so as to illuminate by the prismatic rays the objects in\r\nthe box _m n o p_. The front =D E C= may have an apex, as in Fig. 25,\r\nor may be made spherical to act as a condensing lens, the surface of\r\nwhich may be blackened when necessary, for the purpose of excluding\r\nthe direct light. These illuminators may be attached in various ways\r\nto the tube containing the reflectors, so to have a rotatory motion in\r\nfront of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.]\r\n\r\nWhen the light is strong, a circular disk of fine grained white\r\npaper may be advantageously placed upon the outer face _m o_ of the\r\nobject-box.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n    ON THE CONSTRUCTION AND USE OF THE TELESCOPIC\r\n        KALEIDOSCOPE, FOR VIEWING OBJECTS AT A DISTANCE.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen, in explaining the principles of the Kaleidoscope,\r\nthat a symmetrical picture cannot be formed from objects placed at\r\nany distance from the instrument. If we take the simple Kaleidoscope,\r\nand holding an object-box in contact with the reflectors, gradually\r\nwithdraw it to a distance, the picture, which is at first perfect in\r\nevery part, will, at the distance of one-tenth of an inch, begin to be\r\ndistorted at the centre, from the disunion of the reflected images;\r\nthe distortion will gradually extend itself to the circumference, and\r\nat the distance of eighteen inches, or less, from the reflectors, all\r\nthe symmetry and beauty of the pattern will disappear. An inexperienced\r\neye may still admire the circular arrangement of the imperfect and\r\ndissimilar images; but no person acquainted with the instrument could\r\nendure the defects of the picture, even when the slightest distortion\r\nonly is visible at the centre.\r\n\r\nAs the power of the Kaleidoscope, therefore, in its simple form, is\r\nlimited to transparent objects, or to the outline of opaque objects\r\nheld close to the aperture of the reflectors, it becomes a matter of\r\nconsequence to extend its power by enabling it to produce perfectly\r\nsymmetrical patterns from opaque objects, from movable or immovable\r\nobjects at a distance, or from objects of such a magnitude that they\r\ncannot be introduced before the opening of the reflectors. Without such\r\nan extension of its power, the Kaleidoscope might only be regarded as\r\nan instrument of amusement; but when it is made to embrace objects of\r\nall magnitudes, and at all distances, it takes its place as a general\r\nphilosophical instrument, and becomes of the greatest use in the fine,\r\nas well as the useful arts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.]\r\n\r\nIn considering how this change might be effected, it occurred to\r\nme, that if =M N=, Fig. 27, were a distant object, either opaque or\r\ntransparent, it might be introduced into the picture by placing a lens\r\n=L L=, single or achromatic, at such a distance before the aperture =A\r\nO B=, that the image of the object may be distinctly formed in the air,\r\nor upon a plate of glass, the inner side of which was finely ground,\r\nand in contact with the ends =A O=, =B O= of the reflectors, the plane\r\npassing through =A O B=. By submitting this idea to experiment, I found\r\nit to answer my most sanguine expectations. The image formed by the\r\nlens at =A O B= became a new object, as it were, and was multiplied\r\nand arranged by successive reflexions in the very same manner as if\r\nthe object =M N= had been reduced in the ratio of =M L= to =L A=, and\r\nplaced close to the aperture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.]\r\n\r\nThe Compound or Telescopic Kaleidoscope is therefore fitted up as\r\nshown in Fig. 28, with two tubes, =A B=, =C D=. The inner tube, =A B=,\r\ncontains the reflectors as in Fig. 27, and at the extremity =C=, of the\r\nouter tube =C D=, is placed a lens which, along with the tube, may be\r\ntaken off or put on at pleasure. The focal length of this lens should\r\nalways be much less than the length of the outer tube =C D=, and should\r\nin general be such that it is capable of forming an image at the end\r\nof the reflectors, when =A B= is pulled out as much as possible, and\r\nwhen the object is within three or four inches of the lens. When it is\r\nrequired to introduce into the picture very large objects placed near\r\nthe lens, another lens of a less focal length should be used; and when\r\nthe objects are distant, and not very large, a lens, whose principal\r\nfocal length is nearly equal to the greatest distance of the lens from\r\nthe reflectors, should be employed.\r\n\r\nWhen this compound Kaleidoscope is used as a simple instrument for\r\nviewing objects held close to the aperture, the tube =A B= is _pushed\r\nin as far as it will go_, the cell with the object-plate is slipped\r\nupon the end =C= of the outer tube, and the instrument is used in the\r\nsame way as the simple Kaleidoscope.\r\n\r\nIn applying the compound Kaleidoscope to distant objects, the cell is\r\nremoved and the lens substituted in its place. The instrument is then\r\ndirected to the objects, and the tube =A B= drawn out till the inverted\r\nimages of the objects are seen perfectly distinct, or in focus, and\r\nthe pattern consequently perfectly symmetrical. When this is done, the\r\npattern is varied, both by turning the instrument round its axis, and\r\nby moving it in any direction over the object to which it is pointed.\r\n\r\nWhen the object is about four inches from the lens, the tube requires\r\nto be pulled out as far as possible, and for greater distances it must\r\nbe pushed in. The points suited to different distances can easily\r\nbe determined by experiment, and marked on the inner tube, if it\r\nshould be found convenient. In most of the instruments there is, near\r\nthe middle of the tube =A B=, a mark which is nearly suited to all\r\ndistances beyond _three feet_. The object-plates held in the hand, or\r\nthe mirror-box placed upon a table, at a distance greater than five\r\nor six inches, may be also used when the lens =L= is in the tube. The\r\nfurniture of a room, books and papers lying on a table, pictures on\r\nthe wall, a blazing fire, the moving branches and foliage of trees and\r\nshrubs, bunches of flowers, horses and cattle in a park, carriages in\r\nmotion, the currents of a river, waterfalls, moving insects, the sun\r\nshining through clouds or trees, and, in short, every object in nature\r\nmay be introduced by the aid of the lens into the figures created by\r\nthe instrument.\r\n\r\nThe patterns which are thus presented to the eye are essentially\r\ndifferent from those exhibited by the simple Kaleidoscope. Here the\r\nobjects are independent of the observer, and all their movements are\r\nrepresented with the most singular effect in the symmetrical picture,\r\nwhich is as much superior to what is given by the simple instrument,\r\nas the sight of living or moving objects is superior to an imperfect\r\nportrait of them. When the flame of a blazing fire is the object, the\r\nKaleidoscope creates from it the most magical fireworks, in which the\r\ncurrents of flame which compose the picture can be turned into every\r\npossible direction.\r\n\r\nIn order to mark with accuracy the points on the tube =A B=, suited to\r\ndifferent distances, the instrument should be directed to a straight\r\nline, inclined like _m n_, Fig. 3, to the line bisecting the angular\r\naperture =A O B=, and brought nearer to the centre =O= of the field.\r\nThe perfect junction of the reflected images of the line at the points\r\n_mʹ nʹ_, &c., so as to form a star, or a polygon with salient and\r\nre-entering angles, will indicate with great nicety, that the tube has\r\nbeen pulled out the proper length for the given distance. In this way,\r\na scale for different distances, and scales for different lenses, may\r\nbe marked on the tube.\r\n\r\nIn the construction of the Tele-Kaleidoscope, as it may be called, the\r\ngreatest care must be taken to have the lens of sufficient magnitude.\r\nIf it is too small, the field of view will not coincide with the\r\ncircular pattern, that is, the centre of the circular pattern will\r\nnot coincide with the centre of the field; and this eccentricity will\r\nincrease as the distance of the lens from the reflectors is increased,\r\nor as the object introduced into the picture approaches to the\r\ninstrument. The boundary of the luminous field is also an irregular\r\noutline, consisting of disunited curves. These irregularities are\r\neasily explained. When the lens is too small, the luminous field is\r\nbounded by the brass rim in which the glass is fixed; and as this brass\r\nrim is at a distance from the reflectors, the portion of it presented\r\nto the angular aperture cannot be formed by successive reflexions into\r\na continuous curve; and for the same reason, the upper sectors of the\r\nluminous field are larger than the lower ones, and consequently the\r\ncentre of the pattern cannot coincide with that of the field. In order\r\nto avoid these defects, therefore, the diameter of the lens should be\r\nsuch, that when it is at its greatest distance from the reflectors, the\r\nfield of view may be bounded by the arch =A B=, Fig. 13, and not by the\r\nbrass rim which holds the lens. This may be readily known by removing\r\nthe eye-glass, and applying the eye at =E= when the lens is at its\r\ngreatest distance. If the eye cannot see the brass rim, then the lens\r\nis sufficiently large; but if the brass rim is visible, the lens is too\r\nsmall, and must be enlarged till it ceases to become visible. Sometimes\r\nthe lens has been made so small that the brass rim is seen not only at\r\n=A B=, but appears also above the angular point =O=, and produces a\r\ndark spot in the centre of the picture.\r\n\r\nInstead of using two tubes, a lens is sometimes fitted into a tube\r\nabout an inch longer than the focal length of the glass, and this tube\r\nis slipped upon the object end =A B O=, Fig. 21. This mode of applying\r\nthe lens is, however, inferior to the first method, as there is little\r\nroom for adjusting it to different distances; whereas with the long\r\ntube all objects at a greater distance than four inches from the lens\r\nmay be introduced into the picture—a property which possesses very\r\npeculiar advantages.\r\n\r\nThe extension of the instrument to distant objects is not the only\r\nadvantage which is derived from the use of the lens. As the position\r\nfor giving perfect symmetry is rather within the extremities of the\r\nreflectors than without them; and as it is impossible to place movable\r\nobjects within the reflectors, we are compelled to admit a small\r\nerror, arising principally from the thickness of the objects, and from\r\nthe thickness of the plate of glass which is necessarily interposed\r\nbetween the objects and the reflectors. The compound Kaleidoscope,\r\nhowever, is entirely free from this defect. The image of a distant,\r\nor even of a near object, can be formed within the reflectors, and in\r\nthe mathematical position of symmetry; while, at the same time, the\r\nsubstitution of the image for the object itself, enables us to produce\r\nall the changes in the picture which the motion of the object could\r\nhave effected, merely by turning the instrument round its axis, or by\r\nmoving it horizontally, or in any other direction across the object.\r\nThis instrument may be advantageously placed upon a stand like a\r\ntelescope, and may either have a partial motion of rotation by means\r\nof a ball and socket, as shown in the figure, or what is better, a\r\ncomplete motion of rotation round the axis of the tube =C D=, within a\r\nbrass ring, occupying the place of the ball and socket.[5]\r\n\r\n[5] An instrument called _The Improved Kaleidoscope_ has been recently\r\nbrought out in Paris. It is merely the Telescopic Kaleidoscope\r\n_deteriorated_. It consists of a lens _fixed_ at the distance of\r\nabout two inches in front of the reflectors, and can therefore give\r\nsymmetrical pictures of objects only at _one distance_, while it cannot\r\nbe used as an ordinary Kaleidoscope. The instrument described in the\r\npreceding page, with a lens that can be slipped off, is a much better\r\nKaleidoscope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n    ON THE CONSTRUCTION AND USE OF POLYANGULAR\r\n        KALEIDOSCOPES, IN WHICH THE REFLECTORS CAN BE FIXED\r\n        AT ANY ANGLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all the preceding instruments, the reflecting planes are fixed at\r\nan invariable angle, which is some even aliquot part of 360°; and\r\ntherefore, though the forms or patterns which they create are literally\r\ninfinite in number, yet they have all the same character, in so far\r\nas they are composed of as many pairs of direct and inverted images\r\nas half the number of times that the inclination of the reflectors is\r\ncontained in 360°.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore of the greatest importance, in the application of the\r\nKaleidoscope to the arts, to have it constructed in such a manner, that\r\npatterns composed of any number of pairs of direct and inverted images\r\nmay be created and drawn. With this view, the instrument may be fitted\r\nup in various ways, with paper, cloth, and metallic joints, by means\r\nof which the angle can be varied at pleasure; but the most convenient\r\nmethods are shown in the Figures from Fig. 29 to 35, inclusive, which\r\nrepresent two different kinds of Polyangular Kaleidoscopes, as made by\r\nthe late Mr. R. B. Bate, Optician, London, who had devoted much time\r\nand attention to the perfection of this species of Kaleidoscope.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bate’s Polyangular Kaleidoscope with Metallic Reflectors._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.]\r\n\r\nThe three Figures, viz., 29, 30, and 31, represent the Polyangular\r\nKaleidoscope with metallic reflectors, as made by Mr. Bate. Fig. 29\r\nshows the complete instrument, when mounted upon a stand; Fig. 30\r\nis a section of it in the direction of its length; Fig. 31 is a\r\ntransverse section of it through the line =S T=, Fig. 30, and Fig. 32\r\nshows the lens of the eye-hole =E=. The tube of this instrument is\r\ncomposed of two cones, =M M=, =N N=, Fig. 30, connected together by a\r\nmiddle piece or ring, =R R=, into which they are both screwed. These\r\ntwo cones enclose two highly polished metallic reflectors, =A O=, =B\r\nO=, Fig. 31, only one of them, viz., =B O E=, being seen in Fig. 30.\r\nOne of these reflectors, =B O E=, is fixed to the ring =R R=, by the\r\nintermediate piece =K G L=. The reflector is screwed to this piece by\r\nthe adjustable screws =K=, =L=; and the piece =K G L= is again fixed\r\nto the ring =R R=, by two screws seen above and below =G=, in Fig. 31.\r\nHence the tube, consisting of the cones =M M=, =N N=, and the ring =R\r\nR=, are immovably connected with the mirror =B O E=. The surface of the\r\nreflector =B O E= is adjusted by the screws at =K= and =L=, till it\r\npasses accurately through the axis of the cones and ring as seen in\r\nFig. 31. The other reflector =A O=, is fixed to an outer ring _r r_,\r\nby means of an intermediate piece, similar to =K G L=, the arm =F= of\r\nwhich, corresponding to =G=, passes through an annular space or open\r\narch, of more than 90°, cut out of the circumference of the inner ring\r\n=R R=. The arm =F= is fixed to the outer ring _r r_ by two screws,\r\nseen above and below =F=; and the reflector =A O= is fixed to the bar\r\ncorresponding to =K L=, Fig. 30, by similar screws, for the purpose of\r\nadjusting it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.]\r\n\r\nThe lower edge =O E= of the reflector =B O E= extends about the 15th of\r\nan inch below the axis of the cones, as represented by the dotted line\r\nin Fig. 30; but the lower edge =O E= of the other reflector =A O E=,\r\nwhich is finely ground to an acute angle, forming a perfectly straight\r\nand smooth line, is placed exactly in the axis of the cones, so as just\r\nto touch a line in the reflector =A O E=, which coincides with the axis\r\nof the cone, and to form a junction with that line in every part of\r\nthe two meeting planes. The very nice adjustments which are necessary\r\nto produce so exact a motion are effected by the screws corresponding\r\nto =K= and =L=.\r\n\r\nIf we now fix the outer ring _r r_ into the ring of a stand =S T=,\r\nso as to be held fast, and turn the cones with the hand, we shall\r\ngive motion to the reflector =B O=, so as to place it at any angle\r\nwe please, from 0° to 90°; and during its motion through this arch,\r\nthe junction of the two reflectors must remain perfect, if the\r\ntouching lines are adjusted, as we have described them, to the axis\r\nof motion, which must also be the axis of the cones and rings. If, on\r\nthe contrary, we take away the stand, and, holding the instrument in\r\nthe hand by either of the cones =M=, =N=, turn the ring =R R= with\r\nthe other, we shall give motion to its reflector =A O=, and produce a\r\nvariation in the angle in the same manner as before. The same effect\r\nmay be produced by an endless screw working in teeth, cut upon the\r\ncircumference of the outer ring _r r_.\r\n\r\nIn order to enable the observer to set the reflectors at once to any\r\neven aliquot part of a circle, or so as to give any number of pairs of\r\ndirect and inverted images, the most convenient of the even aliquot\r\nparts of the circle are engraven upon the ring _r r_; so that we have\r\nonly to set the index to any of these parts, to the number 12, for\r\nexample, and the reflectors will then be placed at an angle of 30° (12\r\n× 30 = 360°), and will form a circular field with _twelve_ luminous\r\nsectors, or a star with _six_ points, and consequently a pattern\r\ncomposed of _six_ pairs of direct and inverted images.\r\n\r\nAs the length of the plates is only about five inches, it is\r\nnecessary, excepting for persons very short-sighted, to have a convex\r\nlens placed in front of the eye-hole =E=, as shown in Figs. 30 and\r\n32. A brass ring containing a plane glass screws into the outer ring\r\n=C D=, when the instrument is not in use; and there is an object-box\r\ncontaining fragments of differently coloured glass. This object-box\r\nconsists of two plates of glass, one ground and the other transparent,\r\nset in brass rims. The transparent one goes nearest the reflector, and\r\nthe brass rim which contains it screws into the other, so as to enclose\r\nbetween them the coloured fragments, and regular figures of coloured\r\nand twisted glass. A loose ring surrounds this object-box; and when\r\nthis ring is screwed into the circular rim =C D=, the object-box can be\r\nturned round so as to produce a variety of patterns, without any risk\r\nof its being detached from the outer cone.\r\n\r\nIn applying this instrument to opaque objects, such as engravings,\r\ncoins, gems, or fragments of coloured glass laid upon a mirror, the\r\naperture of the mirrors is laid directly over them, the large cone\r\n=M M= having been previously unscrewed, for the purpose of allowing\r\nthe light to fall freely upon the objects. This property of the\r\nKaleidoscope is of great importance, as in every other form of the\r\ninstrument opaque objects must be held obliquely, and therefore at\r\nsuch a distance from the reflectors as must affect the symmetry of the\r\npattern.\r\n\r\nAs the perfection of the figures depends on the reflectors being kept\r\ncompletely free of dust, particularly at their junction, where it\r\nnaturally accumulates, the greatest facility is given by the preceding\r\nconstruction in keeping them clean. For this purpose, the large cone\r\nmust be unscrewed; the reflectors having been previously closed, by\r\nturning the index to 60 on the ring. They are next to be opened to\r\nthe utmost, and the dust may in general be removed by means of a fine\r\npoint wrapped in clean and dry wash-leather. If any dust, however,\r\nstill adheres, the small screw in the side of the ring opposite\r\nto the index should be removed, and the smaller cone, =N N=, also\r\nunscrewed. By easing the supporting screws of either of the reflectors,\r\ntheir touching sides will separate, so as to allow a piece of dry\r\nwash-leather to be drawn between them. When every particle of dust has\r\nbeen thus removed, the metals should be re-adjusted and closed before\r\nthe cones are replaced; both of which should be screwed firmly into the\r\nring =R R=.\r\n\r\nAs the axis of motion in the preceding construction is necessarily the\r\naxis of the cones and rings, the diameter of these cones and rings must\r\neverywhere be double the breadth of the reflectors. From this cause,\r\nthe tube, and consequently the object-box, are wide, and the instrument\r\nis, to a certain degree, not very portable. This defect is completely\r\navoided in another Polyangular Kaleidoscope constructed by Mr. Bate,\r\nupon entirely different principles, which we shall now proceed to\r\ndescribe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bate’s Polyangular Kaleidoscope with Glass Reflectors._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.]\r\n\r\nA section of the whole of this instrument, in the direction of its\r\nlength, is shown in Fig. 33. A section through =M N= or =O P=, near\r\nthe eye-end, is shown in Fig. 35, Fig. 34 representing the mode of\r\nsupporting the fixed reflector, and Fig. 36 the mode of supporting\r\nthe movable reflector. The tube of the Kaleidoscope, in Fig. 33, is\r\nrepresented by _b c d e f g h_, and consists of two parts, _b c g h_,\r\nand _c d e f g_. The first of these parts unscrews from the second,\r\nand the second contains all the apparatus for holding and moving the\r\nreflectors. At the parts =M N O P=, of the tube, are inserted a short\r\ntube, a section of which is shown in Fig. 34. The object of these tubes\r\nis to support the fixed mirror =A O=, which rests with its lower end\r\n=O= upon the piece of brass _t_. It is kept from falling forwards by\r\nthe tongue _r_, connected with the upper part _s s_, and from falling\r\nbackward by the piece of cork =Q=, which may be removed at any time,\r\nfor the purpose of taking out and cleaning the reflectors. This\r\nlittle tube is fixed to the outer tube by the screws _s_, _s_. The\r\ncontrivance for supporting and moving the second reflector =B O=, is\r\nshown in Fig. 36, in section; and a longitudinal view of it is given\r\nin Fig. 33. The mirror =B O= lies in an opening, cut into two pieces\r\nof brass, =_v_ B _p_=, one of which is placed at =M N=, and the other\r\nat =O P=. These two pieces of brass are connected by a rod _m n_,\r\nFig. 33; and in the middle of this rod there is inserted a screw _k_,\r\nwhich passes through the main tube _c d e f g_, into a broad milled\r\nring _w w_, which revolves upon the tube. As the screw _k_, therefore,\r\nfastens the ring _w w_ to the rod _m n_, the reflector =B O= will be\r\nsupported in the tube by the ring _w w_. The lower part of the mirror\r\n=B O=, or rather of the brass piece =_v_ B _p_=, rests at _y_, upon\r\nthe piece of watch-spring _x y z_, fastened to the main tube at _z_.\r\nThis spring presses the face of the reflector =B O= against the ground\r\nand straight edge of the other reflector =A O=, so as always to effect\r\na perfect junction in every part of their length:—The apparatus for\r\nboth reflectors is shown in Fig. 35. An arch of about 45° is cut out\r\nof the main tube, so as to permit the screw _k_ to move along it; and\r\nhence, by turning the broad ring _w w_, the reflector =B O= may be\r\nbrought nearly to touch the reflector =A O=, and to be separated from\r\nit by an arch of 45°, so as to form every possible angle from nearly\r\n0° to 45°, which is a sufficient range for the Kaleidoscope. The main\r\ntube terminates in a small tube at =E=, upon which may be screwed, when\r\nit is required, a brass cap _e f_, containing a convex lens. A short\r\ntube, or cell, _a a a a_, for containing the object-boxes, slips upon\r\nthe end of the tube, and should always be moved round from right to\r\nleft, in order that the motion may not unscrew the portion of the tube\r\n_b c g h_, upon which it moves. When the instrument is used for opaque\r\nobjects, the end piece, _b c g h_ of the tube, screws off, so as to\r\nadmit the light freely upon the objects.\r\n\r\nThe advantages which the Polyangular Kaleidoscopes possess over all\r\nothers are—\r\n\r\n    1st, That patterns of any number of sectors, from the\r\n        simplest to the most complicated, can be easily\r\n        obtained.\r\n\r\n    2d, That the reflectors can be set, with the most\r\n        perfect accuracy, to an even aliquot part of a\r\n        circle.\r\n\r\n    3d, That the reflectors can be at any time completely\r\n        cleaned and freed from all the dust that\r\n        accumulates between them, and the instrument\r\n        rendered as perfect as when it came from the hands\r\n        of the maker.\r\n\r\nIn order to apply this Kaleidoscope to distant objects, or make it\r\ntelescopic,[6] a piece of tube with a lens at the end of it is put upon\r\nthe end piece, _b c g h_, and may be suited to different distances\r\nwithin a certain range.\r\n\r\n[6] See Chapter X.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nON THE CONSTRUCTION AND USE OF ANNULAR AND PARALLEL KALEIDOSCOPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the instruments already described, the pictures which they create,\r\nthough they may be made of various outlines, have all a centre to which\r\nthe reflected images are symmetrically related. The same instruments\r\ngive an annular pattern, or a pattern returning into itself, and\r\nincluded between two concentric circles, by keeping the objects from\r\nthe central part of the aperture; but as such a pattern can never have\r\nits greatest radius more than the breadth of the mirror, and as annular\r\npatterns of a very great radius, where the eye can see only a portion\r\nof them at a time, are often required, it becomes of importance to\r\nadapt the Kaleidoscope for this species of ornament.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.]\r\n\r\nLet =A C B D=, Fig. 37, be two plane mirrors, and let their\r\ninclination be measured by the angle =A O B=; then, if the eye is\r\nplaced between =C= and =D=, it will observe the reflected images of the\r\nobjects which are placed before the aperture =A C B D=, arranged, in\r\nthe annular segment =M A B N=, round =O=, as a centre. The effect is\r\nexactly the same as if the reflectors had been continued to =O=, with\r\nthis difference only, that the annular segment can never be complete.\r\nThis defect in the segment arises from two causes: When the centre =O=\r\nis near =C D=, the defect is occasioned by the want of a reflecting\r\nsurface to complete the ring, and not from any want of light in the\r\nreflected images; but when the centre =O= is remote from =C D=, the\r\ndefect arises from the want of light in the last reflexions, as well as\r\nfrom the want of a reflecting surface.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the Annular Kaleidoscope is exactly the same as that of\r\nthe common instrument; and therefore all the contrivances for producing\r\nsymmetrical pictures, from near and distant objects, are applicable to\r\nthis instrument. As the picture, however, never can return into itself,\r\nit is of no importance that the angle =A O B= be the aliquot part of a\r\ncircle, the picture being equally complete at all angles. In order to\r\nhave the most perfect symmetry with this Kaleidoscope, the eye should\r\nbe placed at =E=, between the nearest ends of the reflectors, as it\r\nwill there be nearer the plane of both reflectors than in any other\r\nposition. If the two mirrors are brought nearer each other, so that\r\ntheir surfaces always pass through the point O, the deviation from\r\nperfect symmetry will diminish as the eye becomes more and more in the\r\nplane of both; and for the same reason the light of the field will be\r\nmore brilliant.\r\n\r\nWhen the point =O= is infinitely distant, the two reflectors become\r\nparallel to each other, as in Fig. 38, and the series of reflected\r\nimages extends in a straight line, forming beautiful rectilineal\r\npatterns for borders, &c. In this position of the reflectors the eye\r\nshould be placed in the centre at =E=, and the symmetry of the picture\r\nand the light of the field will increase as the distance of the\r\nreflectors diminishes, or as their length is increased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.]\r\n\r\nTwo different kinds of instruments have been constructed on the\r\npreceding principles, the one by Mr. Dollond, and the other by Mr. John\r\nRuthven, both of which possess very valuable properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Dollond’s Universal Kaleidoscope._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.]\r\n\r\nThe instrument constructed by Mr. Dollond is represented in Figs. 39,\r\n40, and 41, in section, and is intended to unite the properties of a\r\ncommon Kaleidoscope, in which the reflectors are inclined at an angle\r\nof 30°, and also those of an Annular and a Parallel Kaleidoscope.\r\nFig. 39 represents the reflectors, etc., when they act as a common\r\nKaleidoscope; and Fig. 40 shows them when they form a parallel\r\nKaleidoscope, an annular Kaleidoscope being formed when they have an\r\nintermediate position. The tube of the instrument is shown, in section,\r\nby =T T=; and to this tube is fixed, by the screws _s s_, a frame of\r\nmetal, _a b_, to which the reflectors are fastened. The reflectors,\r\nwhich are made of the finest speculum metal, are shown at =A O=, =B\r\nO=, and are attached to plates of brass, _c d_, _c d_, whose breadth\r\nexceeds that of the reflectors so as to allow their extremities to\r\ndescend below the point =O=, Fig. 39. A double spring, _y x x y_, is\r\nplaced in the tube, so as to press upon the back of the reflectors, and\r\nkeep them in contact, as shown in Fig. 39, and is sufficiently elastic\r\nas to allow them to open, as in Fig. 40. The milled head =M N=, which\r\npasses through the lower part of the tube, carries, at its lower end, a\r\nvery eccentric button or wheel, the least diameter of which is seen at\r\n_m_, Fig. 39, and the greatest at _m_, Fig. 40. In the first position\r\nit has allowed the reflectors to come into contact at =O=. In the other\r\nposition it has forced them open into the position of parallelism. By\r\nturning the milled head, the lower ends (=O O=) of the reflectors may\r\nbe brought to any distance less than =O O=, so as to form an annular\r\nKaleidoscope. The eye-end of the instrument is shown in Fig. 41. The\r\nlens =E= is placed in a slider, =C D=, which is to be moved according\r\nto the position of the reflectors, being a little above =O=, in Fig.\r\n39, opposite the centre of the tube in Fig. 40, and at an intermediate\r\nposition in the intermediate position of the reflectors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.]\r\n\r\nThis instrument is attached to a stand with a draw-tube, which screws\r\ninto the bottom of a mahogany box. The object-plates, and the lens for\r\nintroducing distant objects, are placed at the end of the instrument,\r\nin the same manner as those of the usual construction. Particular kinds\r\nof objects are selected for giving rectilineal borders.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ruthven’s Universal Kaleidoscope._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.]\r\n\r\nThe instrument constructed by Mr. Ruthven is also a Universal\r\nKaleidoscope, which unites the properties of a Polyangular one with\r\nthose of Annular and Parallel Kaleidoscopes. Its construction will be\r\nunderstood from Figs. 42, 43, and 44, where =A B E F G H= represents a\r\nframe of iron or brass, which slips into the tube. The two sides =A B=,\r\n=F H=, of this frame, are kept together by _four_ cross pieces, _a b_,\r\n_c d_, etc., the other two corresponding to these being invisible in\r\nthe figure. The two reflectors, the ends of which are seen at =Aʹ O=,\r\n=Bʹ O=, are each fixed to a plate of metal _p p_, a section of which is\r\nseen in Fig. 44. Each plate of metal has four cylindrical pins, _p_,\r\n_p_, etc., both on its upper and under edge. The two pins nearest the\r\nends of the reflectors pass through openings in the cross pieces _a b_,\r\n_c d_. On the top of the frame is placed a plate of brass =M N Q P=, in\r\nwhich are cut grooves _e f_, _g h_, _k l_, _m n_; _e f_ and _k l_, and\r\nalso _g h_ and _m n_, being parallel to each other. This plate can be\r\nmoved forwards and backwards between the cross pieces _a b_, _c d_,\r\nby means of a small screw =S S=, working in a female screw fixed upon\r\nthe edge =N O= of the plate, and as the middle pins _p p_, attached to\r\nthe plates which carry the reflectors, pass through the grooves, any\r\nchange in the position of the plate =M Q=, produces a change in the\r\ndistance, _p p_, of the pins, and consequently in the distance of the\r\nupper edges of the reflectors. By turning the screw =S S=, therefore,\r\nthe upper edges of the reflectors may be either brought into contact,\r\nor separated to a distance regulated by the inclination of the grooves\r\n_e f g h_. A similar plate with a similar screw is placed upon the\r\nlower edges of the reflectors, so that we are furnished with the means\r\nof giving the plates any inclination to each other, or placing them at\r\nany distance within certain limits. For example, if the lower edges of\r\nthe plates are in contact, we can vary the angle of their inclination\r\nby separating or closing their upper edges by means of the upper screw.\r\nBy separating the lower edges, we give them the position for annular\r\npatterns, and by making the distance of the lower and upper edges the\r\nsame, we obtain from them rectilineal patterns; and the figures of\r\nthese annular and rectilineal patterns may be either contracted or\r\nexpanded, by altering the distance of the plates when in this parallel\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nON THE CONSTRUCTION AND USE OF POLYCENTRAL KALEIDOSCOPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto we have considered the effects of combining two reflectors,\r\nby means of which the reflected images are arranged around one\r\ncentre, either visible or invisible; but it must be obvious, from\r\nthe principles already explained, that very singular effects will\r\nbe obtained from the combination of three or more reflectors. As\r\nin instruments of this kind the reflected images are arranged\r\nround several centres, we have distinguished them by the name of\r\n_Polycentral_.\r\n\r\nAs 90° is the greatest angle which is an even aliquot part of 360°,\r\nand as all regular polygons, with a greater number of sides than four,\r\nmust have their interior angles greater than 90°, it follows, that\r\nsymmetrical pictures cannot be created by any number of reflectors\r\ngreater than four, arranged like the sides of a regular polygon. If the\r\npolygon is irregular, and consists of four sides, or more, then one of\r\nits angles must exceed 90°, and consequently it cannot give symmetrical\r\npatterns. In constructing Polycentral Kaleidoscopes, we are limited to\r\ncombinations of four or three reflectors.\r\n\r\nThe only modes in which we can combine four reflectors, are so as\r\nto form a hollow square, or a hollow rectangle; but though these\r\ncombinations afford regular patterns, from their angles being even\r\naliquot parts of 360°, yet these figures are composed merely of a great\r\nnumber of squares, or rectangles, the point where every four squares\r\nor rectangles meet being the centre of a pattern. Those, however, who\r\nmay wish to construct such instruments, must make the plates as narrow\r\nas possible at the eye-end, so as to bring the eye, as much as can be\r\ndone, into the plane of all the four reflectors.\r\n\r\nIn combining three reflectors, the limitation is nearly as great; but\r\nthe effect of the combination is highly pleasing. Since the angles at\r\nwhich the reflectors must be placed are even aliquot parts of 360°,\r\nsuch as 90°, 60°, 45°, 36°, 25-¹⁰/₁₄° 22½°, 20°, 18°, etc., which are\r\nthe quotients of 360°, divided by the even numbers, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12,\r\n14, 16, 18, 20, etc.; and since the reflectors are combined in the\r\nform of a prism, the section of which is everywhere a triangle, the\r\nsum of whose angles is 180°, we must select any three of the above\r\neven aliquot parts which amount to 180°; and when the reflectors are\r\ncombined at these angles, they will afford forms perfectly symmetrical.\r\nNow, it is obvious, that these conditions will be complied with when\r\nthe angles are—\r\n\r\n    90° + 45° + 45° = 180°\r\n    90° + 60° + 30° = 180°\r\n    60° + 60° + 60° = 180°\r\n\r\nThe Polycentral Kaleidoscopes are therefore limited to _five_ different\r\ncombinations, namely,—\r\n\r\n    1. Four reflectors of equal breadth, forming a square.\r\n\r\n    2. Four reflectors, two of which are broader than the other\r\n       two, and form, a rectangle.\r\n\r\n    3. Three reflectors at angles of 90°, 45°, and 45°.\r\n\r\n    4. Three reflectors at angles of 90°, 60°, and 30°.\r\n\r\n    5. Three reflectors at angles of 60°, 60°, and 60°.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _On combinations of four mirrors forming a square._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.]\r\n\r\nThe first of these Kaleidoscopes is represented in Fig. 45, where =A\r\nB=, =B C=, =C D=, =D A=, are the four equal and similar reflectors\r\nplaced accurately at right angles to each other. If we consider the\r\neffect only of the two reflectors =A B=, =B C=, and regard =A D=, =D C=\r\nas only the limits of the aperture, it is obvious, from the principles\r\nexplained in Chap. II., that we shall have a regular figure =D _m k\r\nh_ D=, composed of four squares, one of which =D B= is seen by direct\r\nvision; other two =A _l_=, =C _i_= formed by one reflexion from each\r\nmirror; and the fourth =B _k_= composed of two half squares, each half\r\nbeing formed by a second reflexion from each mirror. In like manner,\r\nif we suppose =A D=, =D C= to act alone, they will form a square\r\npattern =B _b d f_=, composed like the last; and the same result will\r\nbe obtained by supposing =B A=, =A D=, and =B C=, =C D= to act alone.\r\nThe combination of these effects will produce a square _a d g k_,\r\ncomposed of nine squares, four of which, formed by second reflexions,\r\nare placed at the angles; other four formed by first reflexions in\r\nthe middle; and one, seen by direct vision, in the centre. Hence,\r\nit follows, that the light of the different squares is symmetrical\r\nas well as the patterns, a property which does not belong to all\r\npolycentral instruments. The pattern, however, does not terminate with\r\nthe square _a d g k_, but extends indefinitely on all sides till the\r\nsquares become invisible, from the extinction of the light by repeated\r\nreflexions. In order to discover the law according to which the squares\r\nsucceed each other, we shall examine in what manner a still larger\r\nsquare =E F G H= is completed round the central square, seen by direct\r\nvision. By considering every square in the large square _a d g k_ as\r\nan object placed before the four reflectors, and recollecting that the\r\nreflected images must be similarly situated behind the reflectors, we\r\nshall find that the larger square =E F G H= is completed by images that\r\nhave suffered two, three, and four reflexions, as marked in the figure,\r\nand that all these are symmetrically arranged with regard to the\r\ncentral square. The squares which are crossed with a dotted diagonal\r\nline, are those composed of two halves, each half being formed by a\r\ndifferent reflector. When a Kaleidoscope is formed out of the preceding\r\ncombination, the aperture, or the breadth of the plates next the eye,\r\nshould not exceed one-sixth of an inch. The effect is very pleasing\r\nwhen the reflectors are accurately joined and nicely adjusted, and when\r\ndistant objects are introduced by means of a lens.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _On combinations of four mirrors forming a rectangle._\r\n\r\nWhen the reflectors are of different breadths, so as to form a\r\nrectangle, the very same effects are produced as in the preceding\r\ncombination, with this difference only, that the images are all\r\nrectangular, in place of being square.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _On combinations of three reflectors at angles of 60°._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.]\r\n\r\nWhen three reflectors are combined at angles of 60°, as shown at =A O\r\nB=, Fig. 46, they form an equilateral triangle, and therefore all the\r\nimages will also be equilateral triangles. The figure =C D E F G H=,\r\nwhich is a truncated equilateral triangle, is obviously composed of\r\nthree hexagonal patterns, of which the sectors, or rather triangles,\r\nare arranged round the three centres =A=, =O=, =B=; the triangle =A O\r\nB= being common to all the three. The three triangles, adjacent to the\r\nsides of =A O B=, are formed by one reflexion from each mirror. The\r\nthree which spring from the vertices =A=, =O=, =B=, of the triangle,\r\nconsist of two halves, each of which is formed by three reflexions,\r\nthe last reflexion of the one half being made from one of the nearest\r\nmirrors, and that of the other half from the other nearest mirror. If\r\nwe consider the formation of a more extended figure, =I L M P N K=,\r\nwhich is also a truncated equilateral triangle, with its truncations\r\ncorresponding to the sides of the former figure, we shall find that it\r\nhas been completed by an addition, to each side of the former, of three\r\nequilateral triangles, two of which are formed by three reflexions, and\r\nthe third, consisting of two halves, formed by four reflexions. This\r\nfigure consists of three entirely separate hexagons, =I C A O H K=, =L\r\nD A B E M=, and =B O G N P F=, all of which are formed of reflected\r\nimages;—of one triangle =A O B= seen by direct vision,—and of three\r\ntriangles =A C D=, =B E F=, =O G H=, consisting of half sectors.\r\n\r\nIn constructing this Kaleidoscope, which, like the two former, has the\r\nequally luminous images symmetrically arranged round the aperture =A O\r\nB=, it is unnecessary to shape all the reflectors with accuracy. When\r\ntwo of them, both of which have a greater breadth than is wanted, are\r\nplaced together, with the edge of the one resting upon the face of the\r\nother, the third reflector, which must be ground with great accuracy to\r\nthe desired shape of the tapering equilateral prism, may then be placed\r\nso that each of its edges rests upon the faces of the other two. When\r\nthis instrument is nicely executed with metallic plates, and when all\r\nthe junctions are perfect, the effects which it produces are uncommonly\r\nsplendid.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _On combinations of three reflectors at angles of 90°, 45°, and 45°._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.]\r\n\r\nThe effect produced by the combination of three reflectors at angles\r\nof 90°, 45°, and 45°, is shown in Fig. 47. The two reflectors =A O=,\r\n=A B= produce a pattern =C D B I=, composed of eight triangles; the\r\nreflectors =B O=, =B A=, likewise give a pattern =A F G H=, composed of\r\neight triangles; and the reflectors =A O=, =O B=, give a pattern =A B H\r\nI=, composed of four triangles. The triangle =I H K= is an image formed\r\nby three reflexions, one half of it being a reflexion of half of =A I\r\n_a_=, from the mirror =B O=, and the other half a reflexion of half of\r\n=B H _b_=, from the mirror =A O=; and the triangle =D E F= consists of\r\ntwo half images, which are reflexions of the two half images in =I O\r\nH=. The remaining triangle =D L F= is a reflexion of =I K H=, from the\r\nmirror =A B=, and is therefore formed by four reflexions.\r\n\r\nAs the three mirrors are not symmetrically placed, with regard to each\r\nother, the equally luminous images are not arranged symmetrically\r\nround the open triangle =A O B=, as in the preceding combinations.\r\nThe effect is, however, very pleasing, and all the reflected images\r\nincluded in the figure =C L G K= are sufficiently bright.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _On combinations of three reflectors at angles of 90°, 60°, and 30°._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.]\r\n\r\nThe most complicated combinations of three reflectors is represented\r\nin Fig. 48. In the first combination, all the angles were equal; in\r\nthe second, two of the angles only were equal; but in the present\r\ncombination, none of them are equal. The field of view, represented in\r\nthe figure by =D E H L M P=, is a truncated rhomb, consisting of no\r\nfewer than _thirty-one_ images of the aperture =A O B=. The figure is\r\ncomposed of two hexagons =D E F B R C=, =R B K L M N=, every division\r\nof the hexagon consisting of two reflected images, and of two rhombs =C\r\nR N P=, =F B K H=, each of which is composed of four reflected images.\r\n\r\nIn this combination, as in the last, the equally luminous sectors\r\nare not symmetrically arranged round the centre =O= of the figure.\r\nIn the rhomb =C R N P=, for example, the four images are formed by\r\nthree, four, and five reflexions; whereas in the corresponding rhomb\r\n=F H K B=, they are formed by two, three, and four reflexions. The\r\neffects produced by a Kaleidoscope constructed in this manner are very\r\nbeautiful, particularly when the reflectors are metallic. In the four\r\nfigures which represent the different combinations of the reflectors,\r\nthe small figures indicate the number of reflexions by which each image\r\nis produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n    ON KALEIDOSCOPES IN WHICH THE EFFECT IS PRODUCED BY\r\n        TOTAL REFLEXION FROM THE INTERIOR SURFACES OF\r\n        TRANSPARENT SOLIDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen light is incident upon the most perfectly polished metals, a very\r\nconsiderable quantity of it is absorbed, and even when the reflexion is\r\nmade at the greatest obliquities, there is a very manifest difference\r\nin the intensity of the direct and the reflected pencil. In the total\r\nreflexion of light from the second surfaces of transparent bodies, the\r\nloss of light is very inconsiderable, and the reflexion is made with a\r\ndegree of brilliancy far surpassing that of the most resplendent metals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.]\r\n\r\nIn constructing a Kaleidoscope upon this principle, we must procure\r\na piece of glass entirely free from veins, and cut it into the form\r\nshown in Fig. 49.[7] The two surfaces =B O E=, =A O E=, must be\r\ninclined at an angle which is the even aliquot part of a circle. They\r\nmust be ground perfectly flat and highly polished, and the junction\r\n=O E= must be made as fine as possible. The upper surface =A B E=\r\nshould be rough-ground, and the side =A B O=, and the side at =E=,\r\nshould be parallel and well polished. If the glass is colourless and\r\ngood, the eye, when placed at =E=, will see the very same appearance\r\nas in the simple Kaleidoscope; and objects placed at =A B O= will be\r\narranged into the same beautiful figures. The only defects attending\r\nthis form of the Kaleidoscope, are the loss of light occasioned by its\r\npassing through a mass of solid glass, not perfectly transparent, and\r\nthe difficulty of obtaining a perfect junction of the two reflecting\r\nplanes. The first of these evils is, however, counterbalanced by\r\nthe great intensity of the light which suffers total reflexion; and\r\nthe second does not exist when the Kaleidoscope is intended to give\r\nrectilineal or annular patterns.\r\n\r\n[7] When this chapter was written (1818), it was very difficult to\r\nprocure glass sufficiently homogeneous for this purpose: but it can now\r\nbe procured from the Glass Works of Messrs. Chance & Co., at Smethwick,\r\nnear Birmingham.\r\n\r\nIn the construction of instruments of this kind, it is necessary to\r\nmake the prism of glass longer than the distance at which the eye\r\ncan see objects with perfect distinctness; that is, if the eye is\r\ncapable of seeing objects distinctly at the distance of five inches,\r\nit will not perceive the same objects distinctly when they are placed\r\nat the end of a prism of glass five inches long. This singular effect\r\narises from a property of plain lenses or pieces of plain glass, in\r\nconsequence of which, they cause divergent rays to diverge from a point\r\nnearer the lens or plate, than that from which they radiated. It will\r\ntherefore be more convenient, for many reasons, to make the glass prism\r\nonly two or three inches long, and obtain distinct vision by means\r\nof a lens placed at the eye-end of it; but, for the reason already\r\nmentioned, the focal length of the lens must be less than the length of\r\nthe glass prism. The lens may even be joined to the prism, by grinding\r\nthe eye-end into a spherical form, but the degree of convexity must be\r\ncalculated upon the principles already stated.\r\n\r\nThe solid form of the Kaleidoscope is peculiarly fitted for polycentral\r\ninstruments, as we have only to polish the side, which would otherwise\r\nhave been left rough, the prism being supposed to be cut to the angles\r\nwhich are necessary to give symmetrical forms, according to the\r\nprinciples stated in Chapter XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n    ON THE APPLICATION OF THE KALEIDOSCOPE TO THE MAGIC\r\n        LANTERN, SOLAR MICROSCOPE, AND CAMERA OBSCURA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.]\r\n\r\nIn the various forms of the Kaleidoscope which have been described\r\nin the preceding chapters, the pictures which it creates are visible\r\nonly to one person at a time; but it is by no means difficult to fit\r\nit up in such a manner as to exhibit them upon a wall to any number of\r\nspectators. The necessary limitation of the aperture at the eye-end\r\nof the instrument, however, is hostile to this species of exhibition,\r\nas it requires a very intense light for the purpose of illuminating\r\nthe objects. The general principle of the apparatus requisite for this\r\npurpose is shown in Fig. 50, where =C D G F= is the tube containing\r\nthe reflectors =A O E=, etc. The objects from which the pictures are\r\nto be created are placed in the cell =C D=, which may be made either\r\nto have a rotatory movement round the axis of the tube, or to slide\r\nthrough a groove, like the sliders of a magic lantern. These objects\r\nare powerfully illuminated by a lens =B=, which concentrates upon them\r\nthe direct light of the lamp or candle =H=, and also the part of the\r\nlight which is reflected from the mirror =M N=. At the eye-end =E=\r\nof the Kaleidoscope, is placed a lens =L L=, close to the end of the\r\nreflectors, and having its centre coincident with the centre of the\r\naperture at =E=. In order that this lens may form behind it an image =P\r\nP= of the objects placed in the object-plate =C D=, its focal length\r\nmust be less than the length =A E= of the plates. If the focal length\r\nof =L L= is so small as one-half of =A E=, then it follows, from the\r\nprinciples of optics, that the distance =L P= at which the image is\r\nformed behind the lens, will be precisely equal to the distance =A E=\r\nof the object; but this is obviously too small a distance, for the\r\ndiameter of =P P= would be equal only to the apparent diameter of the\r\ncircular aperture of the Kaleidoscope, or to twice =A O=. Hence it is\r\nnecessary, that the focal length of the lens =L L= be less than =A E=,\r\nand greater than half of =A E=. Two-thirds, or three-fourths of =A E=\r\nwill be found to be a suitable focal length; for if it is larger than\r\nthis, the image will be formed upon the wall or screen at too great a\r\ndistance from the instrument.\r\n\r\nWhen the instrument is thus fitted up, an enlarged image of the pattern\r\nwill be thrown upon the wall, which must be covered with white paper,\r\nor some white ground, in order to exhibit the colours to advantage. By\r\nturning the object-plate round its centre, or, if it is a rectilineal\r\none, by pushing it through the groove, and at the same time giving it\r\na rotatory motion, the pattern on the wall will undergo every possible\r\ntransformation, and exhibit to the spectators, in a magnified form,\r\nall those variations which have been observed by applying the eye to\r\nthe Kaleidoscope.\r\n\r\nWhen the preceding apparatus is used in daylight, so that the\r\nobjects are illuminated by the rays of the sun, the mirror =M N= is\r\nunnecessary. The Kaleidoscope, etc., must, however, be attached to the\r\npart of the frame of a Solar Microscope, which goes into the aperture\r\nin the window-shutter.\r\n\r\nAs the most brilliant light is obtained from the burning of oxygen,\r\neither by itself, or along with coal gas, as in the Bude light,[8] a\r\nlamp of this kind is peculiarly fitted for displaying the pictures\r\nof the Kaleidoscope to a number of spectators. One of Mr. Bate’s\r\nPolycentral Kaleidoscopes was, many years ago, fitted up with a lamp\r\nof this kind, for exhibition, at the lectures on natural philosophy,\r\ndelivered at Guy’s Hospital, by that eminent chemist, the late William\r\nAllen, Esq., F.R.S.\r\n\r\nThe patterns which are created by the Telescopic Kaleidoscope from\r\nnatural objects, or from objects independent of the instrument, may, in\r\nlike manner, be exhibited to several spectators at once. If the objects\r\nare in a room, such as bunches of flowers, statues, human figures, or\r\nlarge pictures, they must be placed in one apartment, and strongly\r\nilluminated. The lens must then be placed upon the end =A O= of the\r\nKaleidoscope, the object-plate =C D= having been removed, and must be\r\nso adjusted that the images of the objects may fall exactly upon the\r\nend =A O= of the reflectors. The objects may be placed at any distance\r\nfrom the lens, from six inches to twelve feet, according to their\r\nmagnitude, and the pictures will be exhibited with great distinctness\r\nand effect upon the wall of the other apartment. If a blazing fire is\r\nemployed, the most brilliant display of fireworks may be exhibited.\r\nWhen the objects are out of doors, such as trees, shrubs, etc., the\r\nKaleidoscope, with its two lenses, must be fixed in the circular\r\nopening of a window-shutter, and the picture received upon white paper,\r\nor any other suitable ground, as in the Camera Obscura.\r\n\r\n[8] This light was first proposed by myself. See _Edinburgh Review_,\r\nApril 1833, vol. lvii. p. 192.\r\n\r\nSimilar effects may be produced in a portable Camera Obscura, by\r\nplacing the apparatus =C F L L G D= in the moveable drawer of that\r\ninstrument. If the lens =L L= is of such a focal length as to admit\r\nthe formation of the image within the instrument, the picture will\r\nbe finely displayed upon the ground glass, and may be copied with\r\nconsiderable exactness.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding applications of the Kaleidoscope, the great difficulty\r\nto be overcome arises from the smallness of the aperture which can\r\nbe obtained at the eye-end of the reflectors. If we take a larger\r\naperture, for the purpose of gaining more light, the light of the\r\nreflected images is diminished by this very circumstance, and the\r\npicture loses its symmetry at the centre. The only method by which we\r\ncan remove this evil is to lengthen the reflectors, and consequently\r\nincrease their breadth in the same proportion. Let us suppose, for\r\nexample, that when the reflectors are five inches long, we can safely\r\nemploy an aperture _one-fourth_ of an inch in diameter; then if the\r\nplates are made ten inches long, we may use an aperture _two-fourths_\r\nin diameter, the symmetry continuing as complete, and the light of\r\nthe reflected images as intense, as when their length was only five\r\ninches. By increasing the length of the reflectors, therefore, we\r\nincrease also the quantity of light; but, unfortunately, this increase\r\nof length is unfavourable to the other properties of the instrument;\r\nfor we must now use a lens =L L= of a great focal length, which will\r\nrender it necessary to receive the image at a great distance from the\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nIn order to render the effect as brilliant as possible, the inclination\r\nof the reflectors should, in the present case, never exceed 30°, and\r\nmight be even 36° or 45°. The objects should be selected as thin as\r\npossible, and none with dark tints ought to be admitted into the\r\nobject-boxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n    ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF KALEIDOSCOPES WHICH COMBINE THE\r\n        COLOURS AND FORMS PRODUCED BY POLARIZED LIGHT.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapters we have supposed that the objects are\r\nilluminated by common light, and that the forms which compose the\r\nsymmetrical figure are those of material bodies. If we employ polarized\r\nlight we may introduce into the Kaleidoscopic figures, the splendid\r\ncolours produced by crystallized bodies, and also the forms which\r\nthese colours assume, round the optical axes of crystals, or through\r\ndifferent thicknesses of the doubly-refracting substance. The part of\r\nthe polarizing apparatus which polarizes the light, may be a large\r\nNicol’s prism, or a bundle of thin glass plates, or a single plate of\r\nblack glass, fixed at the object end of the Kaleidoscope. The analysing\r\npart of the apparatus may be a Nicol’s prism, or plates of the sulphate\r\nof iodo-quinine, discovered by Dr. William Herapath, of Bristol.\r\nOwing to the thickness of a Nicol’s prism, it is not well fitted for\r\nthe analyser, as it prevents the eye of the observer from getting\r\nsufficiently near the small eye-hole of the Kaleidoscope. The plates\r\nof the sulphate of the iodo-quinine, are therefore peculiarly adapted\r\nfor analysers; and when they can be obtained of the same size as the\r\nangular aperture of the Kaleidoscope, with fixed reflectors, or of the\r\nwhole circular aperture when the reflectors are movable, they will also\r\nform the best polarizers.\r\n\r\nThe crystals which are to give the colours and forms produced by\r\npolarized light and its subsequent analysis, may be either _uniaxal_\r\ncrystals, such as calcareous spar, or quartz, or beryl, or _biaxal_\r\ncrystals, such as selenite, topaz, mica, arragonite, nitre, etc.[9]\r\nThese crystals must be placed at the end of the reflectors, and when\r\nthey transmit polarized light, their brilliant colours and forms will\r\nvary by turning the cell which contains them, or by giving a motion\r\nof rotation to the analyser. Thin films, or laminæ of selenite of\r\ndifferent thicknesses, and generally of such a thickness as gives the\r\nbright rings of the _second_ order of colours in Newton’s scale, may\r\nbe placed in a narrow cell or object-box, and may have their outlines\r\nof various curvatures, so as to combine both form and colour in the\r\nKaleidoscopic figure. Different forms may also be obtained by using\r\npieces of colourless glass of different shapes, or pieces of thin wire\r\nbent into a variety of curves. If the outlines of the pattern are to be\r\nobtained from pieces of glass or wire, the films of selenite might be\r\ncemented to one of the glass plates of the object-box, so as to have\r\ntheir axes lying in different directions.\r\n\r\n[9] See my _Treatise on Optics_, Edit. 1853, Chaps. XXVIII, XXIX.\r\n\r\nThe coloured figures produced by glass quickly cooled, might also\r\nbe advantageously employed, and, likewise, the remarkable forms of\r\ncircular crystals and crystalline groups, when they are sufficiently\r\nlarge to be seen by the naked eye.\r\n\r\nVery beautiful objects may be made by cementing a plate of sulphate of\r\nlime (_selenite_), 0.01818 of an inch thick, to a plate of glass, and\r\ncutting out, upon a turning-lathe, grooves or bands of such different\r\ndepths, as to give different colours by polarized light. Beautiful\r\npatterns may be thus executed in bands or lines of different colours;\r\nbut for the purposes of the Kaleidoscope, it will be sufficient to have\r\ncurves or portions of curves of such different forms and curvatures, as\r\nwill produce agreeable figures by their combination. These curves and\r\nirregular forms of any kind, may be scratched or excavated in the plate\r\nof selenite by the point of a sharp knife, and afterwards polished, or\r\neven deepened, by the action of water, which has the property of slowly\r\ndissolving the selenite.\r\n\r\nIn order to observe the effects produced by polarized light, it is\r\nnot necessary to have the polarizing and analysing apparatus attached\r\nto the Kaleidoscope. The polarizer, in the form of a plate of black\r\nglass, or a bundle of plates of common window-glass, may be laid on\r\nthe table so as to reflect the light into the Kaleidoscope at an angle\r\nof 56°, and the analyser may be held in one hand, and the Kaleidoscope\r\nin the other. In this case, however, it would be better to have the\r\nKaleidoscope fixed, in order that the observer may have the use of his\r\nleft hand, to turn the object-box, which contains the doubly-refracting\r\ncrystal.\r\n\r\nWithout the use of polarized light, very fine forms, and these\r\nsplendidly coloured, may be obtained by means of the coloured rings\r\nexhibited in the _Iriscope_.[10] When two such systems of rings are\r\nformed by breathing through a tube upon black glass, over which soap\r\nhas been rubbed and subsequently wiped off, by a piece of chamois\r\nleather, they form a double system, similar to the biaxial system in\r\nmica and topaz, with curves of various shapes, which exhibit beautiful\r\ncombinations in the Kaleidoscope.\r\n\r\n[10] _Treatise on Optics_, p. 120.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nON THE CONSTRUCTION OF STEREOSCOPIC KALEIDOSCOPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we apply the Kaleidoscope to any statue or architectural ornament,\r\nor any other solid object represented, photographically, on a\r\ntransparent binocular slide, the figures will be combined into a\r\nflat symmetrical pattern, as shown in a future chapter. But if, in\r\nthe lenticular stereoscope, we place a Kaleidoscope between each of\r\nthe two semi-lenses and the statue, or other object in the binocular\r\nslide, we shall then see the statue or other object in full relief\r\nin the symmetrical figure. This, in a rude form, is the Stereoscopic\r\nKaleidoscope.\r\n\r\nIn order to construct the instrument independently of the stereoscope,\r\nwe have only to combine two equal Kaleidoscopes, with their reflecting\r\nmirrors equally inclined to each other, and place at the eye-end of\r\nthem two semi-lenses or quarter lenses, at the distance of two and a\r\nhalf inches, and having their focal lengths equal to the length of the\r\nstereoscope. If the two right and left eye photographs, to which we\r\napply them, are opaque, upon paper or silver plate, an opening must\r\nbe left above the object end of the reflectors, of sufficient size to\r\nallow light to be thrown upon the photographs. When the figures are\r\ntransparent, this aperture must be closed.\r\n\r\nIf the objects in the binocular slides represent either bas-reliefs\r\nor alto-relievos, or statues, or vases, or portions of any solid\r\nbodies, such as animals, plants, or flowers, which can be combined into\r\nsymmetrical patterns, they will appear in their true relief in the\r\nStereoscopic Kaleidoscope. In this way the artist may avail himself\r\nof the instrument in designing circular Gothic windows, the circular\r\ndecorations of ceilings, and rectilineal or curvilineal belts, that\r\nare to be cut out of metals, marble, freestone, or wood, or formed of\r\nplaster of Paris, or metals susceptible of fusion.[11]\r\n\r\n[11] See my _Treatise on the Stereoscope_, Chap. xi. p. 86.\r\n\r\nIf we combine two Telescopic Kaleidoscopes, in the manner already\r\ndescribed, so that the centres of their object-lenses are distant two\r\nand a half inches, and receive the right and left eye pictures of real\r\nobjects upon disks of ground glass, with the ground side touching\r\nthe ends of the reflectors, these objects, though themselves in true\r\nrelief, will be reduced to plane pictures on the ground glass, and\r\nagain brought into stereoscopic relief, and combined into symmetrical\r\npatterns by the instrument. The effect thus produced is different from\r\nwhat we should see were the ground glass removed, and the image of the\r\nobject formed in the air at the end of the reflectors, for the same\r\nreason that the picture of an object in the stereoscope is different\r\nfrom what it appears if viewed directly by the eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nON THE CONSTRUCTION OF MICROSCOPIC KALEIDOSCOPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of _Microscopic Kaleidoscope_ may be given to the instrument,\r\nunder two forms, namely, when it is made to produce symmetrical\r\npatterns from microscopic objects, or when it is made so short that a\r\nlens of a high power is necessary at one end of the reflectors, to see\r\ndistinctly, and magnify the objects at the other end. In both these\r\nforms I have often constructed them so small as one inch and one inch\r\nand a half in length. As the Kaleidoscope, in this minute state, has\r\nbeen applied both in this country and abroad, as a female ornament, we\r\nshall proceed to point out the best method of constructing it.\r\n\r\nSince the aberration from symmetry increases, as the length of the\r\nreflectors is diminished, and since the light of the field diminishes\r\nfrom the same cause, it becomes extremely difficult to obtain correct\r\nfigures, and uniformity of light in small instruments. In order to\r\novercome these difficulties, as far as possible, the reflectors should\r\nbe metallic, and may be either made of polished steel or polished\r\nspeculum metal. The inclination at which they are fixed should not be\r\nless than 36° or 45°; and the eye-hole, which should not exceed ¹/₁₅th\r\nof an inch in diameter, must be placed as near as possible to the\r\nangular point. Since the aberration from symmetry increases with the\r\ndistance of the object from the reflectors, and is much augmented in\r\nsmall instruments, the greatest care must be taken to have the objects\r\nat the least possible distance from the reflectors. To accomplish this,\r\nthe objects themselves should be as thin and slender as they can be\r\nmade; the colours should be brilliant and not gloomy; and they should\r\nbe separated from the reflectors by a thin film of the most transparent\r\nmica, which is superior to glass of equal thickness, even if it could\r\nbe got, from its extreme toughness and elasticity. The mica, indeed,\r\nis easily scratched, but if this should take place to any extent, it\r\ncan easily be replaced by a new film. It would even be of consequence\r\nto bend the mica into a slight concavity, so as to permit the objects\r\nto lie rather within than without the extremity of the reflectors. In\r\norder to see the pattern with perfect distinctness, a lens must be\r\nplaced at the end of the instrument; the focal length of this lens,\r\nhowever, must not be exactly equal to the distance of the objects from\r\nthe eye, but as much greater as possible, so that the eye, by a little\r\nexertion, may be able to obtain distinct vision. The reason of this\r\nwill be understood, by considering that the images of the objects,\r\nseen by reflexions, are thrown to a greater distance, as it were, from\r\nthe eye, and could not therefore be seen distinctly by using a lens\r\nadjusted exactly to the nearest part of the picture. Consequently,\r\nthe focal length of the lens must be a mean between the distances of\r\ndifferent parts of the picture, that is, a little greater than that\r\nwhich is suited to the sector seen by direct vision.\r\n\r\nWhen small Kaleidoscopes are made with four or with three mirrors, the\r\npreceding directions are equally applicable, the greatest care being\r\ntaken that the reflectors taper nearly to a point at the eye-end, so\r\nas not to leave an aperture greater than ⅟₁₅th of an inch in diameter.\r\nWhen they are made of solid glass, the focal length of the lens must be\r\ndetermined from the principles contained in the last chapter.\r\n\r\nThe preceding instruments may be fitted up with a draw-tube and lens,\r\nand when it is required to introduce drawings of pictures and statues,\r\nsmall microscopic photographs may be employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nON THE CHANGES PRODUCED BY THE KALEIDOSCOPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe property of the Kaleidoscope, which has excited more wonder,\r\nand therefore more controversy than any other, is the number of\r\ncombinations or changes which it is capable of producing from a small\r\nnumber of objects. Many persons, entirely ignorant of the nature of the\r\ninstrument, have calculated the number of forms which may be created\r\nfrom a certain number of pieces of glass, upon the ordinary principles\r\nof combination. In this way it follows, that twenty-four pieces of\r\nglass may be combined 1,391,724,288,887,252,999,425,128,493,402,200\r\ntimes—an operation, the performance of which would require hundreds of\r\nthousands of millions of years, even upon the supposition that twenty\r\nof them were performed every minute. This calculation, surprising as\r\nit appears, is quite false, not from being exaggerated, but from being\r\nfar inferior to the reality. It proceeds upon the supposition that\r\n_one_ piece of glass can exhibit only _one_ figure, and that _two_\r\npieces can exhibit only _two_ figures, whereas it is obvious that the\r\ntwo pieces, though they can only be combined in two ways, _in the same\r\nstraight line_, yet the one can be put _above_ and _below_ the other,\r\nas well as upon its right side and its left side, and may be joined,\r\nso that the line connecting their centres may have an infinite number\r\nof positions with respect to a horizontal line. It follows, indeed,\r\nfrom the principles of the Kaleidoscope, that _if only one object is\r\nused, and if that object is a mathematical line without breadth, the\r\ninstrument will form an infinite number of figures from this single\r\nline_. The line may be placed at an infinite number of distances from\r\nthe centre of the aperture, and equally inclined to the extremities\r\nof the reflectors. It may be inclined at an infinite variety of\r\nangles to the radii of the circular field, and it may be placed in an\r\ninfinite variety of positions parallel to any radius. In all these\r\ncases, the Kaleidoscope will form a figure differing in character and\r\nin magnitude. In the first case, all the figures are polygons of the\r\nsame character, but of different sizes. In the second case, they are\r\nstars, differing from each other in the magnitude of their salient and\r\nre-entering angles; and in the third case, they form imperfect figures,\r\nin which the lines unite at one extremity and are open at the other.\r\n\r\nIf, instead of supposing a mathematical line to be the object, we\r\ntake a _single piece_ of coloured glass, with an irregular outline,\r\nwe shall have no difficulty in perceiving, from experiment, that an\r\ninfinite variety of figures may be created from it alone. This system\r\nof endless changes is one of the most extraordinary properties of\r\nthe Kaleidoscope. With a number of loose objects, it is impossible\r\nto reproduce any figure which we have admired. When it is once lost,\r\ncenturies may elapse before the same combination returns. If the\r\nobjects, however, are placed in the cell, so as to have very little\r\nmotion, the same figure, or one very near it, may, without difficulty,\r\nbe recalled; and if they are absolutely fixed, the same pattern will\r\nrecur in every revolution of the object-plate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n    ON THE APPLICATION OF THE KALEIDOSCOPE TO THE FINE AND\r\n        USEFUL ARTS.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the various objects of art which have exercised the\r\nskill and ingenuity of man, we shall find that they derive all their\r\nbeauty from the symmetry of their form, and that one work of art excels\r\nanother in proportion as it exhibits a more perfect development of this\r\nprinciple of beauty. Even the forms of animal, vegetable, and mineral\r\nbodies, derive their beauty from the same source. The human figure\r\nconsists of two halves, one of which is the reflected image of the\r\nother; and the same symmetry of form presents itself in the shapes of\r\nalmost all the various tribes of animated beings. In the structure of\r\nvegetables, the principle of symmetry is less perfectly developed. From\r\nthe extreme delicacy and elasticity of its parts, a plant, regularly\r\nconstructed, would have lost all its symmetry from the influence of\r\ngravitation, or from the slightest breath of wind; and therefore a\r\nsymmetrical combination of parts has been effected only in its leaves\r\nand flowers. When the laws of crystallization are allowed to perform\r\ntheir functions uncontrolled, the beautiful geometrical forms which\r\nthey create are marked with the most perfect regularity. Even their\r\nphysical properties are symmetrically related to some axis or fixed\r\nline; and though all their functions are performed in utter silence and\r\nrepose, yet their physiology, if we may apply that name to the actions\r\nof apparently dead matter, is not less wonderful than that which\r\nembraces the busy agencies of animal and vegetable bodies.\r\n\r\nThe irregular forms which are the foundation of picturesque beauty\r\nconstitute a single exception to the general law, and therefore the\r\nlandscape painter is the only artist who is not professionally led to\r\nthe study of that species of beauty which arises from the inversion and\r\nmultiplication of simple forms.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the immense variety of professions connected both with\r\nthe fine and the useful arts, in which the creation of symmetrical\r\nornaments forms a necessary part, we cannot fail to attach a high\r\ndegree of utility to any instrument by which the operations of the\r\nartist may be facilitated and improved. We are disposed to imagine\r\nthat no machine is really useful, unless it is directly employed in\r\nproviding for our more urgent wants. This, however, is a vulgar error.\r\nAn engine which forms the head of a pin, has, in reality, as much\r\nimportance as an engine for raising water, or for manufacturing cloth;\r\nfor in these cases the three machines have the same object, which\r\nis merely that of abridging manual labour. The water would still be\r\nraised, and the cloth and pins manufactured, if the machines did not\r\nexist; but the machinery insures us a more regular supply of these\r\narticles, and enables us to receive them at a cheaper rate.\r\n\r\nThe operations of machinery have, however, a still higher character in\r\ncomparison with those of individual exertion, when they enable us to\r\nobtain any article, either of necessity or of luxury, in a more perfect\r\nstate. In this case, the machine effects what is beyond the reach of\r\nmanual labour; and instead of being the mere representative of animal\r\nforce, it exhibits a concentration of talent and skill which could not\r\nhave been obtained by uniting the separate exertions of living agents.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider, that in this busy island thousands of individuals are\r\nwholly occupied with the composition of symmetrical designs, and that\r\nthere is scarcely any profession into which these designs do not enter\r\nas a necessary part, so as to employ a portion of the time of every\r\nartist, we shall not hesitate in admitting, that an instrument must\r\nhave no small degree of utility which abridges the labour of so many\r\nindividuals. If we reflect further on the nature of the designs which\r\nare thus composed, and on the methods which must be employed in their\r\ncomposition, the Kaleidoscope will assume the character of the highest\r\nclass of machinery, which improves at the same time that it abridges\r\nthe exertions of individuals. There are few machines, indeed, which\r\nrise higher above the operations of human skill. It will create, in a\r\nsingle hour, what a thousand artists could not invent in the course of\r\na year; and while it works with such unexampled rapidity, it works also\r\nwith a corresponding beauty and precision.\r\n\r\nThe artist who forms a symmetrical design, is entirely ignorant of\r\nthe effect till it is completed—and if the design is to be embodied\r\nin coloured materials, or in stone, or any other solid substance, he\r\nhas no means of predicting the final effect which it is to produce.\r\nEvery result, in short, is a matter of uncertainty: and when the work\r\nis completed, it must remain as it is. The art of forming designs,\r\ntherefore, is in a state of extreme imperfection; and a more striking\r\nproof of this could not be obtained than from the servility with which\r\nwe copy, at the present moment, the mouldings and ornaments of Greek\r\nand Gothic architecture, and the decorations which embellish the\r\nfurniture, the dresses, and the utensils of the Romans.\r\n\r\nIf the Kaleidoscope had been an instrument which merely enabled us to\r\nproject upon a plane surface a variety of designs of the same character\r\nas those which the artist forms with his pencil, it would still have\r\nbeen an instrument of great utility. But it does much more than this.\r\nWhen properly constructed, and rightly applied, it exhibits the _final_\r\neffect of the design, when executed in the best manner; and it does\r\nthis, not only by embodying the very materials out of which the reality\r\nis to be produced; but by exhibiting, instead of lights and shades, the\r\nvery eminences and depressions which necessarily exist in every design\r\nthe parts of which lie in various planes.\r\n\r\nIn proceeding to point out the practical methods of obtaining these\r\neffects from the Kaleidoscope, we take it for granted that the artist\r\nhas one or other of the correct instruments described in the preceding\r\nchapters, and that they are mounted upon a stand, and furnished with\r\nDr. Wollaston’s Camera Lucida, for enabling him to copy the designs\r\nwhich he wishes to perpetuate.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Architectural Ornaments._\r\n\r\nAlmost every public and private edifice, with the exception of\r\npicturesque cottages, and buildings erected for the purposes of\r\ndefence, has a regular form, consisting of two halves, one of which is\r\nthe inverted image of the other. The inferior parts of the building,\r\nsuch as the doors and windows, have the same regular character; and\r\nhence it necessarily follows, that all the decorations, whether in\r\nthe form of rectilineal borders, circular patterns, or groups of\r\nfigures, should not only have the same symmetry, but should also\r\nbe symmetrically related to the bisecting line which separates the\r\nbuilding into two halves. If, for example, a rectilineal border,\r\nsurrounding a building like a belt, consists of a pattern, or of\r\nlines inclined in one direction, such a border is not symmetrically\r\nrelated to the vertical and horizontal lines of which the building\r\nconsists. Hence it will follow, that sculptures, representing an\r\naction of any kind, or statues representing living objects, when\r\nthey are sufficiently large to be seen at the same time with the\r\nwhole building, can never connect themselves with its regular\r\noutline. If these sculptures, or statues, are inverted so as to form\r\na Kaleidoscope pattern, like the beautiful sculpture in the door of\r\nthe temple of Jun-wassa,[12] they may then be employed without the\r\nrisk of destroying the general symmetry of the edifice. These remarks\r\nare equally applicable to every object which derives its beauty from\r\nsymmetry; and it is curious to observe the numerous deviations from\r\nthis principle, and the bad effects they produce on some of the finest\r\nvases and ornaments of the Romans.[13] If Mr. Cockerell’s ingenious\r\ntheory[14] of the original composition of the statues of Niobe and her\r\nchildren be correct, the mode of grouping the figures will show how\r\nmuch the artist was disposed to sacrifice every other kind of effect,\r\nto obtain something like a symmetrical group within the pediment. The\r\ngradual increase in the height of the statues towards the middle of the\r\ntympanum, and their inclination on both sides towards the same point,\r\nform strong proofs of Mr. Cockerell’s hypothesis, and afford a singular\r\nexample, the only one with which we are acquainted, of an attempt to\r\nreconcile the apparently incongruous effect of a real picture and a\r\nsymmetrical group. Had the statues been confined to one-half of the\r\ntympanum, while the other half was a reflected image of the first,\r\nwe are persuaded, that though the effect, as a picture, would have\r\nbeen diminished, yet the effect, as a part of the temple, would have\r\nbeen greatly increased. A very remarkable example of this species of\r\nsymmetry is shown in the fine painting of the Four Sibyls, by Raphael,\r\nwhich is now in the church of Santa Maria della Pace, at Rome.\r\n\r\n[12] See _Edinburgh Encyclopædia_, Art. Civil Architecture, plate CLI.\r\n\r\n[13] See Hope’s _Costume of the Ancients_, vol. ii. plates 230, 264,\r\n278, figs 1 and 298, fig. 2.\r\n\r\n[14] See _Journal of the Royal Institution_, vol. v. p. 99.\r\n\r\nAfter the architect has fixed upon the nature and character of his\r\nornaments, he must cut, upon the surface of a large stone, or place in\r\nrelief upon it, the elements of a variety of patterns. These elements\r\nneed not be exact representations of any object, or any portion of\r\nit, though, in some cases, an approximation to this may be desirable.\r\nWhen this stone is set in a vertical position, and so that the light\r\nmay fall obliquely upon its surface, for the purpose of giving light\r\nand shade to the pattern, the Kaleidoscope should be placed exactly\r\nopposite the stone, and at a distance from it corresponding to the\r\nmagnitude of the pattern which is wanted. The tube containing the\r\nlens or lenses, being put on, or the inner tube being drawn out, if\r\nthe instrument consists of two complete tubes, it must be adjusted\r\nto the distance of the stone, or till an image of the stone is formed\r\nat the end of the reflectors. When this adjustment is perfect, the\r\nKaleidoscope must be directed to the carved part of the stone, out of\r\nwhich it is proposed to form the pattern; and by slight changes in its\r\nposition, by turning it round its axis, and by varying the inclination\r\nof the reflectors, an immense variety of the most beautiful designs\r\nwill be exhibited, in the finest relief, and as perfect as if they had\r\nbeen carved out of the stone by the most skilful workman. The architect\r\nhas therefore only to select from the profusion of designs which are\r\nthus presented to him; and when he has made his choice, he may either\r\ncopy it photographically, or with his eye, or by means of the Camera\r\nLucida; or he may trace upon the stone the projection of the angular\r\naperture of the instrument, in order that, in the execution of his\r\nwork, he may have constantly before his eyes the real element out of\r\nwhich the picture is created. If, in the course of this selection, the\r\npicture should become capable of improvement, either by giving it depth\r\nin particular parts, or by altering the outline, this alteration can\r\nbe easily made, and its effect throughout the whole ornament will be\r\ninstantly seen.\r\n\r\nIf the architect is desirous to introduce into his ornament a natural\r\nobject, such as a leaf, he may first try the effect which it will\r\nproduce when applied in its natural state to the instrument, and he\r\nmay then carve either the whole or the half of it in stone, and then\r\nexamine what will be its final effect. If one half of the leaf is an\r\ninverted image of the other half, it is necessary only to carve one\r\nhalf of it, and place the reflectors at an angle contained as many\r\ntimes in a circle as twice the number of times that he wishes the\r\nwhole leaf to be multiplied: for example, if the whole leaf is to be\r\nmultiplied six times, the angle of the mirrors must be ¹/₁₂th of 360°,\r\nor 30°. The very same effect would be obtained by applying the whole\r\nleaf to the instrument when the inclination of the reflectors is 60°,\r\nor ⅙th of 360°. But when the whole leaf is not symmetrical in itself,\r\nor consists of two dissimilar halves, it must be applied in its entire\r\nstate to the instrument.\r\n\r\nIn the formation of circular Gothic windows, the architect will find\r\nthe Kaleidoscope a most important auxiliary. By applying it to a\r\nmullion drawn upon paper, with a portion of the curves which he wishes\r\nto introduce, or by placing it upon various ornamental parts of the\r\ndrawing of a Gothic cathedral, he will obtain combinations to which he\r\nhas never observed the slightest approximation.\r\n\r\nIn designing the decorations for ceilings, which are generally made of\r\nplaster of Paris, the same method should be followed as that which we\r\nhave described for architectural ornaments.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Ornamental Painting._\r\n\r\nIn ornaments carved out of stone or marble, or formed from plaster of\r\nParis, the idea of colour does not enter into the consideration of\r\nthe architect. The forms, however, which are necessary in ornamental\r\npainting, are always associated with colour; and therefore, in the\r\ninvention and selection of these forms, the Kaleidoscope performs a\r\ndouble task. While it creates the outline, it at the same time fills it\r\nup with colour; and by representing the effect of the two in a state\r\nof combination, it enables the artist to judge of the harmony of his\r\ntints, as well as of the proportion of his forms.\r\n\r\nIn the decoration of public halls and galleries, there is no species of\r\nornament more appropriate than those which consist in the combination\r\nof single figures, or of groups of heads, which are either directly\r\nor metaphorically associated with the history or object of the\r\ninstitution. Regular historical paintings on the ceiling of a room are\r\nquite incompatible with the symmetrical character of a public gallery.\r\nIf they are well executed, they can never be seen to advantage, and\r\ntherefore their individual effect is lost, while, from their very\r\nnature, they cannot possibly produce that general effect as an ornament\r\nwhich good taste imperiously requires. In employing regularly combined\r\ngroups of figures, there is sufficient scope given to the powers of\r\nthe artist, while the systematic arrangement of his work prevents it\r\nfrom interfering with the general character of the place which it is to\r\nembellish.\r\n\r\nThe effects which the Kaleidoscope develops, when applied to the\r\nrepresentations of living objects, will, we have no doubt, give very\r\ngreat surprise to those who have not previously examined them. In\r\norder to enable the reader to form some notion of them, we have given,\r\nin the annexed Plate, a series of reduced figures, taken principally\r\nfrom the antique. In order to separate an individual figure from the\r\nrest, we have only to cut an opening of nearly the same size in a\r\npiece of paper, and lay it upon the surface of the plate, so as to\r\nconceal all the adjoining figures, and permit the required figure to\r\nbe seen through the aperture. By applying a Kaleidoscope, in which the\r\ninclination of the mirrors does not exceed 30°, the figure will be\r\ncombined into a fine pattern, exhibiting, perhaps, the head and a part\r\nof the body in every sector; while the hands, or the lower extremities,\r\nare thrown into the stiff part of the design. The singular ease and\r\ngrace with which the figure necessarily rises out of the formal part\r\nof the pattern, and with which it connects itself with the general\r\npicture, produces a new effect, which, so far as we can learn, no\r\nartist had ever attempted to produce.\r\n\r\nIn order to group these single figures with perfect accuracy, the\r\nKaleidoscopes constructed by Mr. Bate should be employed, as both his\r\ninstruments have a contrivance which allows the light to fall freely\r\nupon the surface of the picture.[15]\r\n\r\n[15] See p. 93.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.]\r\n\r\nWhen the figures which we wish to introduce are larger than the\r\naperture of the Kaleidoscope, we must use the lens, and place them at\r\nsuch a distance as to reduce them to the proper magnitude.\r\n\r\nThe effect which is produced by these simple outlines will convey some\r\nidea of the beauty which must characterize the designs when the figures\r\nare finely shaded, or chastely coloured.\r\n\r\nBy the application of the lens, paintings or statues of any size may be\r\nreduced and admitted into the figure.\r\n\r\nIn order to convey to the reader some idea of the effect produced by\r\nthe Kaleidoscope in grouping figures, we have given in Fig. 51 a design\r\ncreated by the instrument. The inclination of the mirrors by which the\r\nfigures were arranged is 36°, or ⅒th of a circle; and therefore the\r\nobject is multiplied _ten_ times, so as to give _five_ pair of direct\r\nand inverted images.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Designs for Carpets._\r\n\r\nThere is none of the useful arts to which the creations of the\r\nKaleidoscope are more directly applicable than the manufacture of\r\ncarpets. In this case, the manufacturer requires not merely the outline\r\nof a design, but a design filled up with the most brilliant colours;\r\nand upon the nature of the figure which he selects, and the tints with\r\nwhich he enriches it, will depend the beauty of the effect which is\r\nproduced. A carpet, indeed, is in general covered with a number of\r\nKaleidoscope designs, arranged in lines parallel to the sides of the\r\napartment; and while this instrument creates an individual pattern, it\r\nmay also be employed, by the assistance of the lens, in exhibiting the\r\neffect or arranging or grouping these individual patterns, according\r\nto the form of the apartment, and other circumstances which should\r\ninvariably be attended to.\r\n\r\nWhen a plasterer ornaments the ceiling of a room, the figure which\r\nhe chooses is always related to the shape of the ceiling, and varies\r\naccording as it is circular, elliptical, square, or rectangular. In\r\nlike manner, a carpet should always have a relation to the form of\r\nthe apartment, not only in the shape and character of the individual\r\ndesigns, but in the mode in which they are combined into a whole.\r\nAlthough the designs given by the Kaleidoscope are in general circular,\r\nyet, when they are once drawn, their outline may be made either\r\ntriangular, square, rectangular, elliptical, or of any other form that\r\nwe please, without destroying their beauty. The outline of the pattern\r\nmay be varied in the instrument, by varying the shape of the part of\r\nthe tube or aperture which bounds the field of view at the widest\r\nend of the angular aperture; but it is only at certain inclinations\r\nof the reflectors that any of the regular figures can be produced in\r\nthis way. If the bounding line is circular, the field of view will be\r\na circle; if the bounding line is rectilineal, and equally inclined\r\nto the reflectors, the field of view will be a regular polygon, of as\r\nmany sides as the number of times that the angle of the reflectors is\r\ncontained in 360°; if the bounding line is rectilineal, but placed\r\nat right angles to one of the reflectors, the figure will still be\r\na regular polygon, but its number of sides will be equal to _half_\r\nthe number of times that the angle of the reflectors is contained in\r\n360°. Hence it follows, that a square field may be obtained in two\r\nways, either by placing the mirrors at an angle of 45°, and making the\r\nbounding line perpendicular to one of the reflectors; or by inclining\r\nthe mirrors 90°, and making the bounding line equally inclined to\r\nboth reflectors;—and that a triangular field may be obtained, either\r\nby inclining the mirrors 60°, and setting the bounding line at right\r\nangles to one of the reflectors, or by making the inclination 120°, and\r\nplacing the bounding line at an angle of 60° and 30° to the reflectors.\r\nAn elliptical field may be obtained, by giving the bounding line the\r\nshape of one quarter of an ellipse, and placing it in such a manner\r\nthat the vertex of the conjugate axis falls upon one of the reflectors,\r\nand the vertex of the transverse axis upon the other.\r\n\r\nThe form of the pattern being determined, the next step is to select\r\nan outline, and the colours which are to enter into its formation. In\r\norder to do this to the greatest advantage, the differently coloured\r\nworsteds which the manufacturer proposes to employ should be placed\r\nupon a plane surface, either in the state of thread, or, what is\r\nmuch better, when they are wrought into cloth. These differently\r\ncoloured pieces of carpet, which we may suppose to be blue, green, and\r\nyellow, must then be placed at the distance of a few feet from the\r\nKaleidoscope, so that their image may, by means of the lens, be formed\r\nat the end of the reflectors. In this state a very perfect pattern will\r\nbe created by the instrument, and the blue, green, and yellow colour\r\nwill predominate according as a greater or a lesser portion of these\r\ncolours happens to be opposite to the angular aperture. By shifting\r\nthe position of the Kaleidoscope, any one of the colours may be made\r\nto predominate at pleasure; and the artist has it thus in his power,\r\nnot only to produce any kind of outline that he chooses, but regulate\r\nthe masses of colour by which it is to be filled up; and to try the\r\neffects which will be produced by the juxtaposition of two colours, by\r\nthe separation of others, or by the transference of the separate or\r\ncombined masses to different parts of the design. It would be foreign\r\nto our object to describe the apparatus by which these changes in the\r\nquantities of colour, and in their relative position, may be most\r\neasily and conveniently effected; the artist can have no difficulty in\r\nconstructing such an apparatus for himself, and by means of it he will\r\nbe enabled to obtain results from the Kaleidoscope which he would have\r\nsought for in vain from any other method.\r\n\r\nAs the methods we have described of using the Kaleidoscope in\r\nornamental architecture, or ornamental painting, and in the manufacture\r\nof carpets, will apply to the various other professions in which\r\nthe formation of symmetrical designs is a necessary part, I shall\r\nmerely state, that it will be found of the greatest advantage to the\r\njeweller in the arrangement of precious stones; to the bookbinder, the\r\nwire-worker, the paper-stainer, and the artist who forms windows of\r\npainted glass. In this last profession, in particular, the application\r\nof the Kaleidoscope cannot fail to indicate combinations far superior\r\nto anything that has yet been seen in this branch of art. From the\r\nuniformity of tint in the separate pieces of glass which are to be\r\ncombined, the effect produced by the instrument from portions of the\r\nvery same glass that is to be used for the windows, may be considered\r\nas a perfect fac-simile of the window when well executed on a large\r\nscale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n    ON THE PHOTOGRAPHIC DELINEATION OF THE PICTURES\r\n        CREATED BY THE KALEIDOSCOPE.\r\n\r\nIn a preceding chapter we have referred to the delineation of the\r\npictures created by the Kaleidoscope, when they are received on the\r\nground glass of a camera obscura, or when a camera lucida is placed\r\nat the eye-end of the instrument. Both of these methods are very\r\nimperfect, and when the pictures have been copied for useful purposes,\r\nwe believe that they have generally been executed by a skilful\r\ndraughtsman, who delineated carefully one of the sectors of which the\r\nfigure is composed, and then repeated it so as to complete the picture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.]\r\n\r\nSince the invention of the Kaleidoscope, the discovery of the\r\nphotographic art—of the Daguerreotype and Talbotype processes, has\r\ngiven a new value to the instrument. By means of a Kaleidoscope Camera,\r\nthe most complex figures can be almost instantaneously transferred to\r\npaper, or to plated copper, and hundreds of designs offered to the\r\nchoice of the artist who is to employ them. The very same figure which\r\nis obtained by one mode of illumination, may be altered indefinitely,\r\nby merely changing the direction or the intensity of the light, all\r\nthe objects which give the figure remaining fixed in the object-box.\r\nThe optical arrangement by which these figures may be copied,\r\nphotographically, is substantially the same as that which is shown in\r\nFig. 52, where =C G D F= is the Kaleidoscope, =A O= the object-box,\r\nand =L L= a small achromatic lens, of rock crystal or glass, a quarter\r\nof an inch in diameter, placed in contact with the extremities of the\r\nglass or metallic reflectors, and having its centre immediately behind\r\nthe small opening at =E=. When the rays of the sun, or any other strong\r\nlight, containing the actinic rays, are thrown obliquely upon the\r\nobject-box =A O=, an image of the Kaleidoscopic figure, produced by the\r\nobjects in the object-box, will be formed at =P P=, in the focus of the\r\nlens =L L=. If the focal length of the lens =L L= is equal to one-half\r\n=C G=, the length of the Kaleidoscope, the image will be formed behind\r\n=L L=, at a distance equal to =C G=, and of the same size as the\r\nobject-box; but if the focal length of =L L= is greater than the half\r\nof =C G=, the image will be formed at a greater distance than =C G=,\r\nbehind the lens, and the size of it will be greater than that of the\r\nobject-box, the distance and the size of the picture increasing as the\r\nfocal length of the lens increases; and when it becomes equal to =C G=,\r\nthe size and the distance of the picture will be infinitely great. When\r\nthe focal length of the lens is less than half =C G=, the figure will\r\nbe smaller than the object-box, and nearer the lens.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Kaleidoscope Camera._\r\n\r\nEvery camera employed for the purposes of photography may be readily\r\nadapted for taking the pictures formed by the Kaleidoscope. We have\r\nonly to take out the lens or lenses which belong to it, and place the\r\nKaleidoscope furnished with its lens =L L=, Fig. 52, in the inner tube,\r\nwhich is movable by means of the rack and pinion. If the picture can\r\nbe made distinct on the grey glass by the rack and pinion, a negative\r\nor positive copy of it may be taken on collodion or paper, in the same\r\nmanner as other photographs. In some cameras the end of the box which\r\ncontains the grey glass is movable, backwards and forwards, so that the\r\nadjustment for rendering the picture distinct may be effected, though\r\nthe Kaleidoscope is fixed in the front portion of the box.\r\n\r\nWhen the camera is made for the express purpose of taking Kaleidoscope\r\npictures, it becomes a very simple instrument and may be constructed\r\neasily and cheaply. It requires no lens excepting the small one =L\r\nL= of rock crystal or of glass, a quarter of an inch in diameter.\r\nThe aperture required for this lens is so small that the spherical\r\nand chromatic aberration cannot injure, in any sensible manner, the\r\ndistinctness of the picture. The difference between the chemical and\r\nluminous focus, which cannot be made to coincide with a single lens,\r\nmay be easily determined by experiment, or in order to avoid this, the\r\nsmall lens may be made achromatic.[16]\r\n\r\n[16] A thin lens of rock crystal will transmit more of the actinic rays\r\nthan one rendered achromatic.\r\n\r\nThe form of the camera as fitted up with one of Mr. Bate’s\r\nKaleidoscopes, with metallic reflectors, is shown in the annexed\r\nfigure, where =M C D N= is the body of the camera, _m n o p_ the tube\r\nwhich is moved out and in by a milled head attached to the pinion which\r\ndrives the rack on the tube _m n o p_. The Kaleidoscope =A B L L=,\r\nexhibiting the figure which is to be copied, is temporarily fixed in\r\nthis tube by pieces of cork or wood, so that its axis, or the line of\r\njunction of the reflectors, may be perpendicular to the surface of the\r\ngrey glass _p q_, which can be taken out, so as to allow the collodion\r\nor paper slide to be placed in the same groove.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.]\r\n\r\nThe pictures should always be taken, when it is possible, by sunlight\r\nincident obliquely upon the object-box, or with the illuminators\r\nalready described. When this cannot be done, artificial light,\r\ncontaining the actinic or chemical rays, may be thrown upon the object,\r\nas shown in Fig. 52. The light of coal gas, which may be condensed for\r\nany length of time upon the objects in the object-box, will be found\r\nto answer the purpose; but if a more rapid process is required, we\r\nmay, as proposed by Mr. Moule, use the Bengal lights, which contain a\r\nlarge quantity of the actinic rays.[17] These lights are composed of\r\n_six_ parts of _nitre_, _two_ of _sulphur_, and _one_ of _the sulphuret\r\nof antimony_. The powder is made up in the shape of a cone, which is\r\nignited at the top; but it would be better to spread it out widely, in\r\norder that it may be condensed upon the object-box. The lime-ball light\r\nmay also be employed, but the Bude light, which is a coal gas flame,\r\nrendered more intensely luminous by a stream of oxygen, is preferable\r\nto any other artificial flame. In using it, or any other of the lights\r\nalready mentioned, for obtaining Kaleidoscope figures, it must either\r\nbe placed very near the object-box, or condensed upon it by a large\r\nlens, on account of the small size of the aperture at the eye-end of\r\nthe Kaleidoscope.\r\n\r\n[17] See the _Journal of the Photographic Society_, vol. iv. p. 137.\r\n\r\nIn the formation of the Kaleidoscope figures, it is necessary to pay\r\nparticular attention to the colour of the objects of which they are to\r\nbe composed, _red_, _orange_, and _dark yellow_ objects, which transmit\r\nfew, if any, actinic rays, should not be employed. Blue glasses, which\r\ntransmit no red rays, are actinically more luminous than colourless\r\nglasses, and therefore pale blue, pale green, and pale yellow glasses\r\nmay be advantageously combined with colourless glasses as objects for\r\nthe object-box.\r\n\r\nWhen we wish to copy photographically the pictures obtained from\r\nexternal objects, we must use the Telescopic Kaleidoscope of Mr. Bates,\r\nby which the images of these objects are formed at the extremity of\r\nthe reflectors. These objects may be flowers, plants, architectural\r\nornaments, or parts of them, paintings, photographs, statues, or loose\r\nand irregularly placed materials of any kind. In the figures created\r\nby the common Kaleidoscope, we must trust to chance for the formation\r\nof the figures, and can only choose those which we like out of a\r\nlarge number accidentally formed; but when we make use of external\r\nobjects, we can group them and illuminate them in any manner we choose,\r\nselecting those forms and colours which, when combined, produce the\r\neffect that we desire.\r\n\r\nThis power, of arranging the objects, when in contact with the ends of\r\nthe reflectors, may be obtained with the Kaleidoscope of Mr. Bates,\r\nshown in Fig. 29, by removing the anterior half of the cone when the\r\nobjects are opaque, and placing the camera in a vertical position.\r\nThe objects being placed upon a horizontal plate, may, if opaque, be\r\nilluminated, by reflected light, and the picture of them, when combined\r\nby the Kaleidoscope, taken in the same manner as when the instrument\r\nwas in the position shown in Fig. 52. If the figure is not what we\r\nlike, we can shift any individual object, or remove it, or replace it\r\nby another, till we are satisfied with the combination.\r\n\r\nThe very same power of altering the combination, may be obtained\r\nfor transparent objects. We have only to place these objects on a\r\nhorizontal plate of glass, not connected with the Kaleidoscope, but\r\ncapable of being removed from it, and again brought close to the ends\r\nof the reflectors. When the objects on the glass plate have been put\r\ninto their proper place, so as to give the desired picture, the plate\r\nis brought as near as possible to the ends of the reflectors, and\r\nthe objects are illuminated either by solar or other light reflected\r\nupwards upon the object-box.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nON THE ADVANTAGES OF THE KALEIDOSCOPE AS AN INSTRUMENT OF AMUSEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe splendid discoveries which have been made with the telescope and\r\nmicroscope have invested them with a philosophical character which can\r\nnever be attached to any other instrument. It is only, however, in the\r\nhands of the astronomer and naturalist that they are consecrated to the\r\ngreat objects of science; their ordinary possessors employ them solely\r\nas instruments of amusement, and it is singular to remark how soon they\r\nlose their novelty and interest when devoted to this inferior purpose.\r\nThe solar microscope, the camera obscura, and the magic lantern, are\r\nequally shortlived in their powers of entertainment; and even the\r\nwonders of the electrical and galvanic apparatus are called forth, at\r\nlong intervals, for the occasional purposes of instructing the young,\r\nor astonishing the ignorant. A serenity of sky very uncommon in our\r\nnorthern climate, is absolutely necessary for displaying the powers\r\nof some of the preceding instruments; and the effects of the rest can\r\nonly be exhibited after much previous preparation. From these causes,\r\nbut principally from a want of variety in their exhibitions, they have\r\nconstantly failed to excite, in ordinary minds, that intense and\r\ncontinued interest which might have been expected from the ingenuity of\r\ntheir construction and the splendour of their effects.\r\n\r\nThe pleasure which is derived from the use of musical instruments is\r\nof a different kind, and far more intense in its effects, and more\r\ngeneral in its influence than that which is obtained from any of the\r\npreceding instruments. There are, indeed, few minds that are not alive\r\nto the soothing and exhilarating influence of musical sounds, or that\r\ndo not associate them with the dearest and most tender sympathies of\r\nour nature. But the ear is not the only avenue to the heart; and though\r\nsorrow and distress are represented by notes of a deep and solemn\r\ncharacter, and happiness and gaiety by more light and playful tones,\r\nthe same kind of feelings may also be excited by the exhibition of dark\r\nand gloomy colours, and by the display of bright and aërial tints.\r\nThe association, indeed, is not so powerful in the one case as in the\r\nother, for we have been taught from our infancy, in consequence of the\r\nconnexion of music and poetry, to associate particular sentiments with\r\nparticular sounds; but there can be no doubt that the association of\r\ncolour is naturally as powerful as that of sound, and that a person who\r\nhas never listened to any other music but that of nature, nor seen any\r\nother colours but those of the material world, might have his feelings\r\nas powerfully excited through the medium of the eye as through that of\r\nthe ear.\r\n\r\nThe first person who attempted to supply the organ of vision with the\r\nluxuries of light and colour, was Father Castel, a learned Jesuit, who\r\nhad distinguished himself chiefly by his opposition to the splendid\r\noptical discoveries of Newton. About the year 1725 or 1726, he\r\npublished in the _Mercure de Paris_, his first ideas of an organ, or\r\nocular harpsichord. A full account of this curious instrument was\r\nafterwards published at Hamburgh, in 1739, by M. Tellemann, a German\r\nmusician, who had seen one of the harpsichords in the possession of the\r\ninventor, when he was on a visit to Paris. This account was afterwards\r\ntranslated into French, and printed at the end of Castel’s _L’Optique\r\ndes Couleurs_,[18] which appeared at Paris in 1740. The ocular\r\nharpsichord is a common harpsichord, fitted up in such a manner, that\r\nwhen a certain sound is produced by striking the keys, a colour related\r\nto that sound is at the same instant exhibited to the eye in a box or\r\nframe connected with the harpsichord; so that when a piece of music\r\nis played for the gratification of the ear, the eye is simultaneously\r\ndelighted by the display of corresponding colours.\r\n\r\n[18] This work is entitled, _L’Optique des Couleurs, fondée sur les\r\nsimples observations et tourné surtout à la pratique de la peinture,\r\nde la teinture, et des autres arts coloristes_. Par le R. P. Castel,\r\nJesuite. Paris, 1740.\r\n\r\nIn adjusting the colours and the sounds, Castel lays down the following\r\nsix propositions:—\r\n\r\n_1st_,—There is a fundamental and primitive sound in nature, which may\r\nbe called _ut_, and there is also an original and primitive colour,\r\nwhich is the foundation of all other colours, namely, _blue_.\r\n\r\n_2d_,—There are three chords, or essential sounds, which depend upon\r\nthe primitive sound _ut_, and which compose with it a primitive and\r\noriginal accord, and these are _ut_, _mi_, _sol_. There are also three\r\noriginal colours depending on the _blue_, which, while they are not\r\ncomposed of any other colours, produce them all, namely, _blue_,\r\n_yellow_, and _red_. The _blue_ is here the note of the tone, the _red_\r\nis the fifth, and the _yellow_ is the third.\r\n\r\n_3d_,—There are five tonic chords, _ut_, _re_, _mi_, _sol_, _la_, and\r\ntwo semitonic chords, _fa_ and _si_. There are also five tonic colours,\r\nto which all the rest are ordinarily related, namely, _blue_, _green_,\r\n_yellow_, _red_, and _violet_, and two semitonic or equivocal colours,\r\nnamely, _aurora_ and _violant_ (related to the _orange_ and _indigo_ of\r\nNewton).\r\n\r\n_4th_,—Out of these five entire tones, and two semitones, is formed the\r\ndiatonic scale, _ut_, _re_, _mi_, _fa_, _sol_, _la_, and _si_; and,\r\nin like manner, out of the five entire or tonic colours, and the two\r\ndemi-colours, are formed the gradation of colours, _blue_, _green_,\r\n_yellow_, _aurora_, _red_, _violet_, and _violant_; for the _blue_\r\nleads to _green_, which is _demi-blue_; the _yellow_ to _aurora_, which\r\nis _gilded yellow_; the _aurora_ leads to _red_, the _red_ to _violet_,\r\nwhich is two-thirds of _red_, and one-third of _blue_; and the _violet_\r\nto _violant_, which has more _blue_ than _red_.\r\n\r\n_5th_,— The entire tones divide themselves into semitones; and the\r\nfive entire tones of the scale or gamut, comprehending in this the\r\ntwo natural semitones, make twelve semitones, viz., _ut_ natural,\r\n_ut_ dieze, _re_, _re_ dieze, _mi_, _fa_, _fa_ dieze, _sol_, _sol_\r\ndieze, _la_, _la_ dieze, and _si_. In like manner there are twelve\r\ndemi-colours, or demi-tints, and there can be neither more nor less,\r\naccording to the opinion of painters themselves, and as may be\r\ndemonstrated by other means. These colours are _blue_, _sea-green_,\r\n_green_, _olive_, _yellow_, _aurora_, _orange_, _red_, _crimson_,\r\n_violet_, _agathe_, and _violant_. _Blue_ leads to _sea-green_,\r\nwhich is a _greenish blue_; _sea-green_ leads to _green_; _green_ to\r\n_olive_, which is a _yellowish green_; _olive_ to _yellow_; _yellow_\r\nto _aurora_; _aurora_ to _orange_; _orange_ to _red_, the colour\r\nof fire; _red_ to _crimson_, which is _red_ mixed with a little\r\n_blue_; _crimson_ to _violet_, which is still more _blue_; _violet_ to\r\n_agathe_, or _bluish violet_; and _agathe_ to _violant_.\r\n\r\n_6th_,—The progression of sounds is in a circle, setting out from _ut_,\r\nand returning back: thus, _ut_, _mi_, _sol_, _ut_, or _ut_, _re_, _mi_,\r\n_fa_, _sol_, _la_, _si_, _ut_. This is called an octave, when the last\r\n_ut_ is one-half more acute than the first. The colours also have their\r\nprogression in a circle.\r\n\r\n_7th_,—After an octave, _ut_, _re_, _mi_, _fa_, _sol_, _la_, _si_,\r\nthere recommences a new one, which is one-half more acute, and the\r\nwhole circle of music produces several octaves.\r\n\r\nSuch are the principles upon which the ocular harpsichord was founded;\r\nbut though the instrument, from its singularity, excited great\r\nattention when it was first constructed, we have not been able to learn\r\nthat it was ever supposed to possess the power of affording pleasure to\r\nthe eye. It must be obvious, indeed, to any person who considers the\r\nsubject, that colour, independent of form, is incapable of yielding a\r\ncontinued pleasure. Masses of rich and harmonious tints, following one\r\nanother in succession, or combined according to certain laws, would no\r\ndoubt give satisfaction to a person who had not been familiar with the\r\ncontemplation of colours; but this satisfaction would not be permanent,\r\nand he would cease to admire them as soon as they ceased to be new.\r\nColour is a mere accident of light, which communicates richness and\r\nvariety to objects that are otherwise beautiful; but perfection of form\r\nis a source of beauty, independent of all colours; and it is therefore\r\nonly from a combination of these two sources of beauty that a sensation\r\nof pleasure can be excited.\r\n\r\nThose who have been in the habit of using a correct Kaleidoscope,\r\nfurnished with proper objects, will have no hesitation in admitting\r\nthat this instrument realizes, in the fullest manner, the formerly\r\nchimerical idea of an ocular harpsichord. The combination of fine\r\nforms, and ever-varying tints, which it presents in succession to\r\nthe eye, have already been found, by experience, to communicate\r\nto those who have a taste for this kind of beauty, a pleasure as\r\nintense and as permanent as that which the finest ear derives from\r\nmusical sounds. An eye for admiring and appreciating the effect of\r\nfine forms, seems, indeed, to be much more general than an ear for\r\nmusic; and we have heard of many cases where the tedium of severe and\r\ncontinued indisposition has been removed, and where many a dull and\r\nsolitary hour has been rendered cheerful, by the unceasing variety of\r\nentertainment which the Kaleidoscope afforded. In one respect, indeed,\r\nthis instrument is superior to all others. When it is once properly\r\nconstructed, its effects are exhibited without either skill or labour;\r\nand so numerous are its applications, and so inexhaustible its stores,\r\nthat the observer is constantly flattered with the belief that he has\r\nobtained results which were never seen before, and that he has either\r\nimproved the instrument, or extended its power, by new applications.\r\n\r\nSuch are the advantages, as an instrument of amusement, which the\r\nKaleidoscope possesses, even in its present imperfect state. To what\r\ndegree of perfection it may yet arrive, it is not easy to anticipate;\r\nbut we may venture to predict, because we see the steps by which\r\nthe prediction is to be fulfilled, that combinations of forms and\r\ncolours may be made to succeed each other in such a manner as to\r\nexcite sentiments and ideas with as much vivacity as those which are\r\nexcited by musical composition. If it be true that there are harmonic\r\ncolours which inspire more pleasure by their combination than others;\r\nthat dull and gloomy masses, moving slowly before the eye, excite\r\nfeelings of sadness and distress; and that the aërial tracery of light\r\nand evanescent forms, enriched with lively colours, are capable of\r\ninspiring us with cheerfulness and gaiety; then it is unquestionable,\r\nthat, by a skilful combination of these passing visions, the mind may\r\nderive a degree of pleasure far superior to that which arises from the\r\nimmediate impression which they make upon the organ of vision. A very\r\nsimple piece of machinery is alone necessary for introducing objects of\r\ndifferent forms and colours, for varying the direction of the motion\r\nacross the angular aperture, and for accommodating the velocity of\r\ntheir motion to the effect which it is intended to produce.\r\n\r\nThese combinations of colours and forms may be adapted to a piece of\r\nmusic, and their succession exhibited on a screen by means of the\r\nelectric, or lime-ball, or other lights to which we have already had\r\noccasion to refer. The coloured objects might be fixed between long\r\nstripes of glass, moved horizontally or obliquely across the ends of\r\nthe reflectors; and the effects thus obtained might be varied by the\r\noccasional introduction of revolving object-boxes, containing objects\r\nof various colours and forms, partly fixed and partly movable. Similar\r\nforms in different colours, and in tints of varying intensity, losing\r\nand resuming their peculiar character with different velocities, and in\r\ndifferent times, might exhibit a distinct relation between the optical\r\nand the acoustic phenomena simultaneously presented to the senses.\r\nFlashes of light, coloured and colourless, and clouds of different\r\ndepths of shadow, advancing into, or emerging from the centre of\r\nsymmetry, or passing across the radial lines of the figure at different\r\nobliquities, would assist in marking more emphatically the gay or the\r\ngloomy sounds with which they are accompanied.\r\n\r\nA slight idea of the effects which might be expected from an ingenious\r\npiece of mechanism for creating and combining the various optical\r\nphenomena, and exhibiting them in connexion with musical sounds, may\r\nbe obtained by a single observer, who looks into a fine Kaleidoscope,\r\nfirmly fixed upon a stand, and produces with his two hands all the\r\nvariations in form and colour which he can effect by such inadequate\r\nmeans, and which he considers appropriate to the musical piece that\r\naccompanies them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n    HISTORY OF THE COMBINATIONS OF PLANE MIRRORS WHICH HAVE\r\n        BEEN SUPPOSED TO RESEMBLE THE KALEIDOSCOPE.\r\n\r\nIt has always been the fate of new inventions to have their origin\r\nreferred to some remote period; and those who labour to enlarge the\r\nboundaries of science, or to multiply the means of improvement, are\r\ndestined to learn, at a very early period of their career, that the\r\ndesire of doing justice to the living is a much less powerful principle\r\nthan that of being generous to the dead. This mode of distributing\r\nfame, injurious as it is to the progress of science, by taking away one\r\nof the strongest excitements of early genius, has yet the advantage of\r\nerring on the side of generosity; and there are few persons who would\r\nreclaim against a decision invested with such a character, were it\r\npronounced by the grave historian of science, who had understood and\r\nstudied the subject to which it referred.\r\n\r\nThe apparent simplicity, both of the theory and the construction of the\r\nKaleidoscope, has deceived very well-meaning persons into the belief\r\nthat they understood its mode of operation; and it was only those that\r\npossessed more than a moderate share of optical knowledge, who saw that\r\nit was not only more difficult to understand, but also more difficult\r\nto execute, than most of the philosophical instruments now in use. The\r\npersons who considered the Kaleidoscope as an instrument consisting\r\nof two reflectors, which multiplied objects, wherever these objects\r\nwere placed, and whatever was the position of the eye, provided that\r\nit received only the reflected rays, were at no loss to find numerous\r\ncandidates for the invention. All those, indeed, who had observed the\r\nmultiplication and circular arrangement of a fire blazing between two\r\npolished plates of brass or steel; who had dressed themselves by the\r\naid of a pair of looking-glasses, or who had observed the effects of\r\ntwo mirrors placed upon the rectangular sides of a drawing-room, were\r\nentitled, upon such a definition, to be constituted inventors of the\r\nKaleidoscope. The same claim might be urged for every jeweller who had\r\nerected in his window two perpendicular mirrors, and placed his wares\r\nbefore them, in order to be multiplied and exhibited to advantage;\r\nand for every Dutch toy-maker, and dealer in optical wonders, who had\r\nmanufactured show-boxes, for the purpose of heaping together, in some\r\nsort of order, a crowd of images of the same object, of different\r\nintensities, seen under different angles, and presenting different\r\nsides to the eye. This mode of grouping images, dissimilar in their\r\ndegree of light, dissimilar in their magnitude, and dissimilar in\r\ntheir very outlines, produced such a poor effect, that the reflecting\r\nshow-boxes have for a long series of years disappeared from among the\r\nnumber of philosophical toys.\r\n\r\nFrom these causes, the candidates for the merit of inventing the\r\nKaleidoscope have been so numerous, that they have started up in every\r\npart of the world; and many individuals, who are scarcely acquainted\r\nwith the equality of the angles of incidence and reflexion, have not\r\nscrupled to favour the world with an account of the improvements which\r\nthey fancy they have made upon the instrument.[19]\r\n\r\n[19] It would be an easy matter to amuse the reader with an account\r\nof these improvements. One of the most notable of them consists\r\nin covering the back of the reflectors with white paint, for the\r\npurpose of increasing the light of the circular field. This scheme\r\nis identically the same as if the author had proposed to improve the\r\nmagnificent telescopes of Herschel, when rendered dark with a high\r\nmagnifying power, by _white-washing_ the interior of the tube.\r\n\r\nThe earliest writer who appears to have described the use of two plane\r\nmirrors, was Baptista Porta, who has given an account of several\r\nexperiments which he performed with them, in the second chapter of the\r\nseventh book of his _Magia Naturalis_.\r\n\r\nAs the combination of plane mirrors which he there describes has been\r\nrepresented as the same as the Kaleidoscope, we shall give the passage\r\nat full length:—\r\n\r\n         _Speculum è planis multividum construere._\r\n\r\n    “Speculum construitur, quod _polyphaton_ id est multorum\r\n    visibilium dicitur, illud enim aperiendo et claudendo solius\r\n    digiti viginti et plura demonstrat simulacra. Sic igitur id\r\n    parabis. Ærea duo specula vel crystallina rectangula super\r\n    basim eandem erigantur, sintque in hemiolia proportione,\r\n    vel alia, et secundum longitudinis latus unum simul colligentur,\r\n    ut libri instar apte claudi et aperiri possint, et anguli\r\n    diversentur, qualia Venetiis factitari solent: faciem\r\n    enim unam objiciens, in utroque plura cernes ora, et hoc\r\n    quanto arctius clauseris, minorique fuerint angulo: aperiendo\r\n    autem minuentur; et obtusiori cernes angulo, pauciora numero\r\n    conspicientur. Sic digitum ostendens, non nisi digitos\r\n    cernes, dextra insuper dextra, et sinistra sinistra convisuntur;\r\n    quod speculis contrarium est: mutuaque id evenit\r\n    reflexione, et pulsatione, unde imaginum vicissitudo.”\r\n                                   —_Edit. Amstelod_, 1664.\r\n\r\nThe following is an exact and literal translation of this passage:—\r\n\r\n    _How to construct a multiplying speculum out of plane ones._\r\n\r\n    A speculum is constructed, called _polyphaton_, that is,\r\n    _which shows many objects_, for by opening and shutting it,\r\n    it exhibits twenty and more images of the finger alone.\r\n    You will therefore prepare it in the following manner:—Let\r\n    two rectangular specula of brass or crystal be erected\r\n    upon the same base, and let their length be one and a half\r\n    times their width, or in any other proportion; and let two\r\n    of their sides be placed together, so that they may be opened\r\n    and shut like a book, and the angles varied, _as they are\r\n    generally made at Venice_. For by presenting your face,\r\n    you will see in both more faces the more they are shut, and\r\n    the less that the angle is; but they will be diminished by\r\n    opening it, and you will see fewer as you observe with a\r\n    more obtuse angle. If you exhibit your finger, you will\r\n    see only fingers, the right fingers being seen on the right\r\n    side, and the left on the left side, which is contrary to\r\n    what happens in looking-glasses, and this arises from the\r\n    mutual reflexion and repulsion which produce a change of\r\n    the images.[20]\r\n\r\n[20] We request that the reader will take the trouble of comparing with\r\nthe original the following translation of Baptista Porta’s description,\r\nwhich was published in London, and copied into all the foreign\r\nnewspapers, etc. We hope the translator of it had no improper motive\r\nin altering the obvious meaning of the original; yet it is singular,\r\nthat in the journal where this translation appeared, the specification\r\nof the patent was published under the title of Directions for making\r\nthe Kaleidoscope, purporting to be an original communication to that\r\njournal, the name of the patentee, and the technical parts of the\r\nspecification having been left out, apparently to promote the belief\r\nthat there was no patent, and that every person might make them with\r\nimpunity. The following is the translation alluded to:—\r\n\r\n“In the following manner we may construct a mirror for seeing a\r\nmultitude of objects on a plain surface. This kind of mirror,\r\nwhen constructed, is what is called _polyphaton_, that is to say,\r\nmultiplying, for by opening and shutting, it shows twenty and more\r\nimages of one single finger. If, therefore, you wish to prepare it, let\r\ntwo brazen or crystal rectangular mirrors be erected on the same base,\r\nand let the proportion of length be one and a half of the width, or any\r\nother proportion; and let each side for the whole of its length be so\r\nconnected together that they may easily be shut and opened like a book,\r\nand that the angles may be varied, as they are usually constructed at\r\nVenice; for if you place _one object opposite to the face of each_,\r\nyou will see _several figures_; and this in proportion as you shut it\r\ncloser, and the angle shall be less. But, by opening, _the objects_\r\nwill be reduced in number, and the more obtuse the angle under which\r\nyou see it, the _fewer objects_ will be seen. So if you exhibit your\r\nfinger _as the object_, you will see nothing but fingers. The right\r\nfingers will be seen on the right side, and the left on the left side,\r\nwhich is contrary to the usual custom with looking-glasses; but this\r\nhappens from the mutual reflexion and repulsion which produce a change\r\nof the images.”\r\n\r\nIt is quite obvious, from the preceding passage, that the multiplying\r\nspeculum described by Porta was not an invention of his own, but had\r\nbeen long made at Venice. In the very next chapter, indeed, where he\r\ndescribes a _speculum theatrale_ or _amphitheatrale_ (the _show-box_\r\nof Harris and other modern authors), he expressly states, that a\r\nmultiplying speculum was invented by the ancients.—“Speculum autem\r\nè planis compactum, cui si unum spectabile demonstrabitur, plura\r\nillius rei simulachra demonstrabit, _prudens invenit vetustas_; ut ex\r\nquibusdam Ptolemæi scriptis quæ circumferuntur percipitur;” that is, “a\r\nspeculum consisting of plane ones, which, when one object is presented\r\nto it, will exhibit several images of it, was invented by skilful\r\nantiquity, as appears from some of the writings of Ptolemy.” This\r\nspeculum, which consists of several mirrors arranged in a polygon, with\r\nthe object within it, is characterized by Porta as puerile, and much\r\nless wonderful and agreeable than one of his own, which he proceeds to\r\ndescribe. This new speculum consists of ten mirrors, placed within a\r\nbox, in a sort of polygonal form, with one of the sides of the polygon\r\nopen. Architectural columns, pictures, gems, pearls, coloured birds,\r\netc., are all placed within the box, and their images are seen heaped\r\ntogether in inextricable disorder, as a whole, but so as to astonish\r\nthe spectator by their number, and by the arrangement of individual\r\ngroups. Porta speaks of this effect as so beautiful, “_ut nil jucundius\r\nnil certe admirabilius oculis occurset nostris_,”—that nothing more\r\nagreeable, and certainly nothing more admirable, was ever presented to\r\nour eyes.\r\n\r\nIt would be an insult to the capacities of the most ordinary readers\r\nto show that the instruments here described by Baptista Porta have no\r\nfarther connexion with the Kaleidoscope than that they are composed of\r\nplane mirrors.\r\n\r\nThe sole purpose of these instruments was to _multiply_ objects by\r\nreflexion; and so little did the idea of producing a symmetrical\r\npicture enter into Baptista Porta’s contemplation, that he directs the\r\nmirrors to be placed at any angle, because the multiplying property\r\nof the mirrors is equally developed, whatever be the angle of their\r\ninclination.\r\n\r\nThe show-box of which Porta speaks with such admiration, has so many\r\nmirrors, and these are placed at such angles, that not one of the\r\neffects of the Kaleidoscope can be produced from them. Its beauty is\r\nentirely derived from the accumulation of individual images.\r\n\r\nThe next competitor for the invention of the Kaleidoscope is the\r\ncelebrated Kircher, who describes, as an invention of his own, the\r\nconstruction of two mirrors which can be opened and shut like the\r\nleaves of a book. This instrument is represented in Fig. 54, and is\r\ndescribed in the following passage:—\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.]\r\n\r\nPARASTASIS I.\r\n\r\n_Specula plana multiplicativa sunt specierum unius rei._\r\n\r\nVide Fig. 54.\r\n\r\nMira quædam et a nemine, quod sciam observata proprietas elucescit in\r\nduobus speculis ita constructis, ut ad instar libri claudi et aperiri\r\npossint; ponantur illa in plano quopiam, in quo semicirculum in gradus\r\nsuos descriptum habeas. Si enim punctum, in quo specula committuntur,\r\nin centro semicirculi statuas, ita ut utrumque speculi latus diametro\r\ninsistat, semel tantam videbitur rei imago, apparebuntque duæ res, una\r\nextra speculum vera, altera intra, phantastica: Si vero specula ita\r\nposueris, ut divaricatio laterum 120 gradus intercipiat, videbis rei\r\nintra latera est, quia angulus reflexionis et incidentiæ tantus est,\r\nquantus est angulus interceptus a lateribus, videlicet 120 grad. qui\r\ncum obtusius sit, non nisi binam imaginem causare potest, ut in Propos.\r\nv. fol. 848, ostensum est. Si vero specula interceperint angulum 90\r\ngraduum, videbis in plano circulum in quatuor partes divisum, in\r\nquibus totidem simulacra rei positæ comparabunt, tria phantastica,\r\net unum verum; cum enim reflectio fiat ad angulos rectos utrumque\r\nlatus reflectens formam causabit intra se alias duas formas, unde et\r\nconsequentur pro multiplicatione laterum formæ multiplicabuntur, quæ\r\net in reflectione laterum normam servabunt uti in Propos. v. fol.\r\n848, ostendimus. Porro si speculorum latera interceperint angulum 72\r\ngraduum, videbis in plano horizontali efformari perfectum et regulare\r\npentagonum, in quo totidem formæ apparebunt, item, si sexaginta\r\ngraduum interceperint angulum, videbis hexagonum totidemque formas\r\nquinque nimirum phantasticas unam veram. Ita, si speculorum angulus\r\ninterceperit 51 gradus cum ³/₇ comparebit perfectum heptagonum,\r\ncum totidem rei intra specula collocatæ formis; non secus angulus\r\nspeculorum 45 graduum dabit octogonum; 40 graduum dabit enneagonum;\r\n36 graduum decagonum; 32 graduum angulus cum ⁸/₁₁ dabit endecagonum\r\net denique angulus 30 graduum referet dodecagonum cum totidem formis,\r\net sic in infinitum; ita ut semper tot laterum sit futurum polygonum\r\nanacampticum totidemque formarum, quot polygonum cuivis latus\r\nspeculorum intercipit divaricatio, latera habuerit: quorum omnium\r\nrationes dependent a Propos. v. precedentis distinctionis. —Kircheri,\r\n_Ars Magna Lucis et Umbræ_. Rom. 1646, p. 890.\r\n\r\nThe following is a translation of the preceding passage:—\r\n\r\nPARASTASIS I.\r\n\r\n_Plane specula may be made to multiply the images of one object._ See\r\nFig. 54.\r\n\r\nA wonderful, and, so far as I know, a new property, is exhibited by\r\ntwo specula, so constructed that they may be opened and shut like a\r\nbook. If they are placed upon any plane, in which there is a semicircle\r\ndivided into degrees, in such a manner that the point where the\r\nspecula meet is in the centre of the circle, and the edge of each\r\nspeculum stands upon the diameter of the semicircle, one image only\r\nwill be visible, and there will appear two things, namely, a real one,\r\nwithout the specula, and another formed by reflexion behind them,[21]\r\nand so on, as in the following table, where the first column shows\r\nthe inclination of the specula, and the second the figure which is\r\nproduced:—\r\n\r\n[21] I have thrown the rest of the passage into a tabular form, that\r\nthe reader may see, more readily, the effect produced by the variation\r\nof the angle.\r\n\r\n    _Angle of Specula._    _Effect produced._\r\n       180°                one image and one object,\r\n      *120°                two images and one object,\r\n        90°                four images,\r\n       *72°                a pentagon and five forms,\r\n        60°                a hexagon and six forms,\r\n       *51³/₇°             a heptagon and seven forms,\r\n        45°                an octagon and eight forms,\r\n       *40°                an enneagon and nine forms,\r\n       36°                 a decagon and ten forms,\r\n      *32⁸/₁₁°             an endecagon and eleven forms,\r\n       30°                 a dodecagon and twelve forms,\r\n\r\nand so on, _ad infinitum_, the polygon formed by reflexion having\r\nalways as many sides as the number of times that the angle of the\r\nspecula is contained in 360°.\r\n\r\nThe combination of plane mirrors, which Kircher describes in the\r\npreceding extract, is precisely the same as that which is given by\r\nBaptista Porta. The latter, indeed, only mentions, that the number of\r\nimages increases by the diminution of the angle, whereas Kircher gives\r\nthe number of images produced at different angles, and enumerates the\r\n_regular polygons_ which are thus formed.\r\n\r\nIt must be quite obvious to any person who attends to Kircher’s\r\ndescription, that the idea never once occurred to him of producing\r\nbeautiful and symmetrical forms by means of plane mirrors. His _sole\r\nobject_ was to multiply a given regular form a certain number of times;\r\nand he never imagined that, when the mirrors were placed at the angles\r\nmarked with an asterisk, there could be no symmetry in the figure, and\r\nno union of the two last reflected images, unless in the case where\r\na regular object was placed, either by design or by accident, in a\r\nposition symmetrically related to both the reflectors.\r\n\r\nIn Kircher’s mirrors the eye was placed in front of them. The object\r\ntherefore was much nearer the eye than the images, and the light of\r\nthe different reflected images was not only extremely unequal, but\r\nthe difference in their angular magnitude was such that they could\r\nnot possibly be united into a symmetrical whole. From the accidental\r\ncircumstance of his using _lines upon paper_ as an object, the\r\ndistortion of the pictures arising from the erroneous position of the\r\neye was prevented; but if the same combination of mirrors were applied\r\nto the object-plates of the Kaleidoscope, it would be found utterly\r\nincapable of producing any of the fine forms which are peculiar to that\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nIf it were necessary to prove that Kircher and his pupils were entirely\r\nignorant of the positions of the eye and the object which are necessary\r\nto the production of a picture, symmetrical in all its parts, and\r\nuniformly illuminated, and that they went no farther than the mere\r\nmultiplication of forms that were previously regular and symmetrical,\r\nwe would refer the reader to Schottus’ _Magia Universalis Naturæ et\r\nArtis_, printed at Wurtzbourg in 1657, where he repeats, almost word\r\nfor word, the description of Kircher, and adds the following curious\r\nobservation:—“But it is not only the objects placed in the semicircle\r\nin the angle of the glasses that are seen and _multiplied_, but also\r\nthose which are more distant; for example, a wall, with its windows,\r\nand in this case the multiplication produced by the mirrors will create\r\nan immense public place, adorned with edifices and palaces.” This\r\npassage shows, in the clearest manner, not only that the multiplication\r\nof an object, independent of the union of the multiplied objects into\r\na symmetrical whole, was all that Kircher and his followers proposed\r\nto accomplish; but also that they were entirely unacquainted with\r\nthe effects produced by varying the distance of the object from the\r\nmirrors. If any person should doubt the accuracy of this observation,\r\nwe would request him to take Kircher’s two mirrors, to direct them to\r\na “wall with its windows,” either by Kircher’s method, or even by any\r\nother way that he chooses, and to contemplate “the public place adorned\r\nwith edifices and with palaces.” He will see heaps of windows and of\r\nwalls, some of the heaps being much larger than others; and some being\r\nfarther from, and others nearer to, the centre; and some being dark,\r\nand others luminous; while all of them are disunited. Let him now take\r\na Telescopic Kaleidoscope, and direct it to the same object; he will\r\ninstantly perceive the most perfect order arise out of confusion, and\r\nhe will not scruple to acknowledge, that no two things in nature can\r\nbe more different than the effects which are produced by these two\r\ncombinations of mirrors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.]\r\n\r\nWe come now to consider the claims of Mr. Bradley, Professor of\r\nBotany in the University of Cambridge. In a work, entitled, _New\r\nImprovements in Planting and Gardening_, published in 1717, this\r\nauthor has drawn and described Kircher’s apparatus as an invention of\r\nhis own; and, instead of having in any respect improved it, he has\r\nactually deteriorated it, in so far as he has made the breadth of the\r\nmirrors greater than their height. An exact copy of the mirrors used\r\nby Bradley is shown in Fig. 55, from which it will be at once seen,\r\nthat it is precisely the same as Kircher’s, shown in Fig. 54. We are\r\nfar from saying that Bradley stole the invention from Kircher, or that\r\nKircher stole it from Baptista Porta, or that Baptista Porta stole it\r\nfrom the ancients. There is reason, on the contrary, to think that the\r\napparatus had been entirely forgotten, in the long intervals which\r\nelapsed between these different authors, and there can be no doubt that\r\neach of them added some little improvement to the instrument of their\r\npredecessors. Baptista Porta saw the superiority of two mirrors, as a\r\nmultiplying machine, to a greater number used by the ancients. Kircher\r\nshowed the relation between the number of images and the inclination\r\nof the mirrors; and Bradley, though he rather injured the apparatus,\r\nyet he had the merit of noticing, that figures upon paper, which had a\r\ncertain degree of irregularity, like those in Fig. 56, could still form\r\na regular figure.\r\n\r\nIn order that the reader may fully understand Bradley’s method of using\r\nthe mirrors, we shall give it in his own words:—\r\n\r\n“We must choose two pieces of looking-glass (says he), of equal\r\nbigness, of the figure of a long square, _five_ inches in length, and\r\n_four_ in breadth; they must be covered on the back with paper or silk,\r\nto prevent rubbing off the silver, which would else be too apt to crack\r\noff by frequent use. This covering for the back of the glasses must be\r\nso put on, that nothing of it may appear about the edges on the bright\r\nside.\r\n\r\n“The glasses being thus prepared, they must be laid face to face, and\r\nhinged together, so that they may be made to open and shut at pleasure,\r\nlike the leaves of a book; and now the glasses being thus fitted for\r\nour purpose, I shall proceed to _explain the use of them_.\r\n\r\n“Draw a large circle upon paper; divide it into three, four, five, six,\r\nseven, or eight equal parts; which being done, we may draw in every one\r\nof the divisions a figure, at our pleasure, either for garden-plats or\r\nfortifications; as, for example, in Fig. 55, we see a circle divided\r\ninto six parts, and upon the division marked =F= is drawn part of a\r\ndesign for a garden. Now, to see that design entire, which is yet\r\nconfused, we must place our glasses upon the paper, and open them to\r\nthe sixth part of the circle, _i.e._, one of them must stand upon the\r\nline _b_, to the centre, and the other must be opened exactly to the\r\npoint _c_; so shall we discover an entire garden-plot in a circular\r\nform (if we look into the glasses), divided into six parts, with as\r\nmany walks leading to the centre, where we shall find a basin of an\r\nhexagonal figure.\r\n\r\n“The line =A=, where the glasses join, stands immediately over the\r\ncentre of the circle, the glass =B= stands upon the line drawn from the\r\ncentre to the point =C=, and the glass =D= stands upon the line leading\r\nfrom the centre to the point =E=: the glasses being thus placed, cannot\r\nfail to produce the complete figure we look for; and so whatever equal\r\npart of a circle you mark out, let the line =A= stand always upon the\r\ncentre, and open your glasses to the division you have made with your\r\ncompasses. If, instead of a circle, you would have the figure of a\r\nhexagon, draw a straight line with a pen from the point _c_ to the\r\npoint _b_, and, by placing the glasses as before, you will have the\r\nfigure desired.\r\n\r\n“So likewise a pentagon may be perfectly represented, by finding the\r\nfifth part of a circle, and placing the glasses upon the outlines of\r\nit; and the fourth part of a circle will likewise produce a square, by\r\nmeans of the glasses, or, by the same rule, will give us any figure\r\nof equal sides. I easily suppose that a curious person, by a little\r\npractice with these glasses, may make many improvements with them,\r\nwhich, perhaps, I may not have yet discovered, or have, for brevity\r\nsake, omitted to describe.\r\n\r\n“It next follows that I explain how, by these glasses, we may, from the\r\nfigure of a circle, drawn upon paper, make an oval; and also, by the\r\nsame rule, represent a long square from a perfect square. To do this,\r\nopen the glasses, and fix them to an exact square; place them over a\r\ncircle, and move them to and fro till you see the representation of\r\nthe oval figure you like best; and so, having the glasses fixed, in\r\nlike manner move them over a square piece of work till you find the\r\nfigure you desire of a long square. In these trials you will meet with\r\nmany varieties of designs. As for instance, Fig. 56, although it seems\r\nto contain but a confused representation, may be varied into above\r\ntwo hundred different representations, by moving the glasses over it,\r\nwhich are opened and fixed to an exact square. In a word, from the most\r\ntrifling designs, we may, by this means, produce some thousands of good\r\ndraughts.\r\n\r\n“But that Fig. 56 may yet be more intelligible and useful, I have drawn\r\non every side of it a scale, divided into equal parts, by which means\r\nwe may ascertain the just proportion of any design we shall meet within\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“I have also marked every side of it with a letter, as =A=, =B=, =C=,\r\n=D=, the better to inform my reader of the use of the invention, and\r\nput him in the way to find out every design contained in that figure.\r\n\r\n“Example I.—Turn the side =A= to any certain point, either to the\r\nnorth, or to the window of your room; and when you have opened your\r\nglasses to an exact square, set one of them on the line of the side\r\n=D=, and the other on the line of the side =C=, you will then have a\r\nsquare figure four times as big as the engraved design in the plate:\r\nbut if that representation should not be agreeable, move the glasses\r\n(still open to a square) to the number 5 of the side =D=, so will one\r\nof them be parallel to =D=, and the other stand upon the line of the\r\nside =C=, your first design will then be varied; and so by moving your\r\nglasses, in like manner, from point to point, the draughts will differ\r\nby every variation of the glasses, till you have discovered at least\r\nfifty plans, differing from one another.\r\n\r\n“Example II.—Turn the side marked =B=, of Fig. 56, to the same point\r\nwhere =A= was before, and by moving your glasses as you did in the\r\nformer example, you will discover as great a variety of designs as\r\nhad been observed in the foregoing experiment; then turn the side\r\n=C= to the place of =B=, and, managing the glasses in the manner I\r\nhave directed in the first example, you may have a great variety of\r\ndifferent plans, which were not in the former trials; and the fourth\r\nside, =D=, must be managed in the same manner with the others; so that\r\nfrom one plan alone, not exceeding the bigness of a man’s hand, we\r\nmay vary the figure at least two hundred times; and so, consequently,\r\nfrom _five_ figures of the like nature, we might show about a thousand\r\nseveral sorts of garden-plats; and if it should happen that the reader\r\nhas any number of plans for parterres or wilderness-works by him, he\r\nmay, by this method, alter them at his pleasure, and produce such\r\ninnumerable varieties, that it is not possible the most able designer\r\ncould ever have contrived.”\r\n\r\nIn reading the preceding description, the following conclusions cannot\r\nfail to be drawn by every person who understands it.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Dr. Bradley, like Kircher, considers his mirrors as applicable to\r\nregular figures, such as are represented in Fig. 55, and was entirely\r\nunacquainted with the fact, that the inclination of the mirrors must\r\nbe an _even_ aliquot part of a circle. This is obvious, from his\r\nstating that the mirrors may be set at the _third_, fourth, _fifth_,\r\nsixth, _seventh_, or eighth part of a circle; for if he had tried to\r\nset an irregular object between the mirrors when placed at the _third_,\r\n_fifth_, or _seventh_ part of 360°, he would have found that a complete\r\nfigure could not possibly be produced.\r\n\r\n2. From the erroneous position of the eye in front of the mirrors,\r\nthere is such an inequality of light in the reflected sectors, that the\r\nlast is scarcely visible, and therefore cannot be united into a uniform\r\npicture with the real objects.\r\n\r\n3. As the place of the eye in Bradley’s instrument is in front, and\r\ntherefore much nearer the object, or sector, seen by direct vision,\r\nthe angular magnitudes of all the different sectors are different,\r\nand hence they cannot unite into a symmetrical figure. This is so\r\nunavoidable a result of the erroneous position of the eye—a position\r\ntoo, rendered necessary from the absurd form of the mirrors—that\r\nBradley actually employs his mirrors to convert a circle into an\r\nellipse, and a square into a rectangle!\r\n\r\n4. In Bradley’s instrument, the sectors thus unequally shaped, and\r\nunequally illuminated, are all separated from one another, by a space\r\nequal to the thickness of the glass plates; and from the same cause,\r\nthe images reflected from the first surface interfere with those\r\nreflected from the second, and produce a confusion or overlapping of\r\nimages entirely incompatible with a symmetrical picture.\r\n\r\nThese results are deduced upon the supposition that the object\r\nconsists of lines drawn upon the surface of paper, the only purpose\r\nto which Bradley ever applied his mirrors; but when we attempt to use\r\nthese mirrors as a Kaleidoscope, and apply them to the objects which\r\nare usually adapted to that instrument, we shall fail entirely, as\r\nthe mirrors are utterly incapable of producing the beautiful and\r\nsymmetrical forms which belong to that instrument.\r\n\r\nWe come now to consider the method of applying the mirrors to the\r\nobject shown in Fig. 55, which is an exact, but reduced copy of\r\nBradley’s figure. Because the angles of this figure are 90°, he directs\r\nthat the mirrors “be opened and fixed to an exact square; and that the\r\nedge of one of the mirrors must always be placed so as to coincide\r\nexactly with one of the sides of the rectangle, and carefully kept\r\nin this line when the position of the mirrors is changed.” Hence it\r\nis manifest, that Bradley was entirely ignorant of the fundamental\r\nprinciple of the Kaleidoscope, namely, that if the inclination of the\r\nmirrors is an even aliquot part of a circle, and if they are _set in\r\nany position upon any object or set of objects, however confused,\r\nor distorted, or irregular, they will create the most perfect and\r\nsymmetrical designs_. But even if Bradley had been aware of this\r\nprinciple in theory, neither he nor any other person was acquainted\r\nwith the mode of constructing and fitting up the reflectors, in order\r\nto render them capable of producing the effect. The position of the\r\neye, for symmetry of light, and for symmetry of form;—the position of\r\nthe mirrors, to produce a perfect junction of the last sectors;—the\r\nposition of the object necessary to produce an equality and perfect\r\njunction between the object and the reflected images;—and the method\r\nof accomplishing this for objects at all distances, were fundamental\r\npoints, in the combination of plane mirrors, which, so far as I\r\nknow, have never been investigated by any author. But even though a\r\nknowledge of these theoretical points had been obtained, numerous\r\ndifficulties in the practical construction of the instrument remained\r\nto be surmounted; and it required no slight degree of labour and\r\nattention to enable the instrument to develop, in the most simple and\r\nefficacious manner, the various effects which, in theory, it was found\r\nsusceptible of producing.\r\n\r\nAs the combination of mirrors, described by Kircher and Bradley, had\r\nbeen long known to opticians, and had excited so little attention that\r\nthey had even ceased to be noticed in works on optical instruments, it\r\nbecame necessary to discover some other origin for the Kaleidoscope.\r\nThe thirteenth and fourteenth Propositions of Wood’s _Optics_, and\r\nsome analogous propositions in Harris’s _Optics_, were therefore\r\npresumed to be an anticipation of the invention. Professor Wood gives a\r\nmathematical investigation of the number and arrangement of the images\r\nformed by two reflectors, either inclined or parallel to each other.\r\nThese theorems assign no position to the eye, or to the object, and do\r\nnot include the principle of inversion, which is absolutely necessary\r\nto the production of symmetrical forms. The theorems, indeed, which\r\nhave no connexion whatever with any instrument, are true, whatever\r\nbe the position of the eye or the object; and Mr. Wood has frankly\r\nacknowledged, “that the effects produced by the Kaleidoscope were never\r\nin his contemplation.”[22]\r\n\r\n[22] See Appendix, p. 185.\r\n\r\nThe propositions in Harris’s _Optics_ relate, like Professor Wood’s,\r\nmerely to the multiplication and circular arrangement of the apertures\r\nor sectors formed by the inclined mirrors, and to the progress of a\r\nray of light reflected between two inclined or parallel mirrors; and\r\nno allusion whatever is made, in the propositions themselves, to any\r\ninstrument. In the propositions respecting the multiplication of the\r\nsectors, the eye of the observer is never once mentioned; and the\r\nproposition is true, if the eye has an infinite number of positions;\r\nwhereas, in the Kaleidoscope, the eye can only have one position. In\r\nthe other proposition (Prop. XVII.) respecting the progress of the\r\nrays, the eye and the object are actually stated to be placed _between\r\nthe reflectors_; and even if the eye had been placed without the\r\nreflectors, as in the Kaleidoscope, the position assigned it, at a\r\ngreat distance from the angular point, is a demonstration that Harris\r\nwas _entirely ignorant of the positions of symmetry, either for the\r\nobject or the eye_, and could not have combined two reflectors so as to\r\nform a Kaleidoscope for producing beautiful or symmetrical forms.[23]\r\nIt is important also to remark, that all Harris’s propositions relate\r\neither to sectors or to small circular objects; and that he supposes\r\nthe very same effects to be produced when the inclination of the\r\nmirrors is an _odd_, as when it is an _even_, aliquot part of a\r\ncircle. It is clear, therefore, that he was neither acquainted with\r\nthe fundamental point in the theory of the Kaleidoscope, nor with\r\nany of its practical effects. The _only practical part_ of Harris’s\r\npropositions is the fifth and sixth scholia to Prop. XVII. In the\r\nfifth scholium he proposes a sort of catoptric box, or cistula,\r\nknown long before his time, composed of four mirrors, arranged in\r\na most unscientific manner, and containing opaque objects _between\r\nthe speculums_. “Whatever they are,” says he, when speaking of the\r\nobjects, “the upright figures between the speculums should be slender,\r\nand not too many in number, otherwise they will too much _obstruct the\r\nreflected rays from coming to the eye_.” This shows, in a most decisive\r\nmanner, that Harris knew nothing of the Kaleidoscope, and that he has\r\nnot even improved the common catoptric cistula, which had been known\r\nlong before. The principle of inversion, and the positions of symmetry,\r\nwere entirely unknown to him. In the sixth scholium, he speaks of rooms\r\nlined with looking-glasses, and of luminous amphitheatres, which were\r\nknown even to the ancients, and have been described and figured by all\r\nthe old writers on optics.\r\n\r\n[23] See Chap. I. pp. 11, 12, where we have shown that Harris was not\r\neven acquainted with the way in which the last sector is formed by\r\nreflexion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough I have no doubt that the observations contained in the\r\npreceding Chapters are sufficient to satisfy every candid and\r\nintelligent person respecting the true nature of all the combinations\r\nof plane mirrors that preceded the invention of the Kaleidoscope, yet\r\nas there are many who are incapable, from want of optical knowledge,\r\nto understand the comparison which has been made between them, I shall\r\nhere present the opinions of four of the most eminent mathematicians\r\nand natural philosophers.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is contained in a note from the late Professor\r\nWood, Master of St. John’s College, Cambridge, written in reply to a\r\nletter, in which I requested him to say, if he had any idea of the\r\neffects of the Kaleidoscope when he wrote the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\nPropositions of his works on Optics.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      “ST. JOHN’S, _May 19, 1818_.\r\n    “SIR,—The propositions I have given relating to the\r\n    number of images formed by plane reflectors, inclined to\r\n    each other, contain merely the mathematical calculation of\r\n    their number and arrangement. _The effects produced by\r\n    the Kaleidoscope were never in my contemplation._ My\r\n    attention has for some years been turned to other subjects,\r\n    and I regret that I have not time to read your Optical\r\n    Treatise, which I am sure would give me great pleasure.—I\r\n    am, Sir, your obedient humble servant,\r\n\r\n                                          “J. WOOD.”\r\n\r\nThe following is the opinion of the late celebrated Mr. James Watt:—\r\n\r\n    “It has been said here,” says Mr. Watt, “that you\r\n    took the idea of the Kaleidoscope from an old book on\r\n    gardening. My friend, the Rev. Mr. Corrie, has procured\r\n    me a sight of the book. It is Bradley’s Improvements of\r\n    Planting and Gardening. London, 1731, Part II. Chap. I.\r\n    It consists of two pieces of looking-glass, of equal bigness,\r\n    of the figure of a long square, five inches long, and four\r\n    inches high, hinged together upon one of the narrow sides,\r\n    so as to open and shut like the leaves of a book, which,\r\n    being set upon their edges upon a drawing, will show it\r\n    multiplied by repeated reflexions. This instrument I have\r\n    seen in my father’s possession seventy years ago, and frequently\r\n    since, but what has become of it I know not. In\r\n    my opinion, the application of the principle is very different\r\n    from that of your Kaleidoscope.”\r\n\r\nThe following is the opinion of the late Mr. Playfair, Professor of\r\nNatural Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh:—\r\n\r\n                         “EDINBURGH, _May 11, 1818_.\r\n\r\n    “I have examined the Kaleidoscope invented by Dr.\r\n    Brewster, and compared it with the description of an\r\n     instrument which it has been said to resemble, constructed\r\n    by Bradley in 1717. I have also compared its effect with\r\n    an experiment to which it may be thought to have some\r\n    analogy, described by Mr. Wood in his _Optics_, Prop. XIII.\r\n    and XIV.\r\n\r\n    “From both these contrivances, and from every optical\r\n    instrument with which I am acquainted, the Kaleidoscope\r\n    appears to differ essentially, both in its effect and in the\r\n    principles of its construction.\r\n\r\n    “As to the effect, the thing produced by the Kaleidoscope\r\n    is a series of figures presented with the most perfect\r\n    symmetry, so as always to compose a whole, in which\r\n    nothing is wanting and nothing redundant. It matters not\r\n    what the object be to which the instrument is directed; if\r\n    it only be in its proper place, the effect just described is\r\n    sure to take place, and with an endless variety. In this\r\n    respect the Kaleidoscope appears to be quite singular among\r\n    optical instruments. Neither the instrument of Bradley,\r\n    nor the experiment or theorem in Wood’s book, have any\r\n    resemblance to this; they go no further than the multiplication\r\n    of the figure.\r\n\r\n    “Next, as to the principle of construction, Dr. Brewster’s\r\n    instrument requires _a particular position of the eye of the\r\n    observer, and of the object looked at_, in order to produce its\r\n    effect. If either of these is wanting, the symmetry vanishes,\r\n    and the figures are irregular and disunited. In the other\r\n    two cases, no particular position, either for the eye or the\r\n    object, is required.\r\n\r\n    “For these reasons, Dr. Brewster’s invention seems to\r\n    me quite unlike the other two. Indeed, as far as I know,\r\n    it is quite singular among optical instruments; and it will\r\n    be matter of sincere regret, if any imaginary or vague analogy,\r\n    between it and other optical instruments, should be\r\n    the means of depriving the Doctor of any part of the reward\r\n    to which his skill, ingenuity, and perseverance, entitle him\r\n    so well.\r\n\r\n                                     “JOHN PLAYFAIR,\r\n\r\n                        _Professor of Natural Philosophy in\r\n                              the University of Edinburgh_.”\r\n\r\n    “_P.S._—Granting that there were a resemblance between\r\n    the Kaleidoscope and Bradley’s instrument, in any of the\r\n    particulars mentioned above, the introduction of coloured\r\n    and movable objects, at the end of the reflectors, is quite\r\n    peculiar to Dr. Brewster’s instrument. Besides this, a circumstance\r\n    highly deserving of attention, is the use of two\r\n    lenses and a draw-tube; so that the action of the Kaleidoscope\r\n    is extended to objects of all sizes, and at all distances\r\n    from the observer, and united, by that means, to the\r\n    advantages of the telescope.\r\n\r\n                                                     “J. P.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Pictet’s opinion is stated in the following letter:—\r\n\r\n    “SIR,—Among your friends, I have not been one of the\r\n    least painfully affected by the shameful invasion of your\r\n    rights as an inventor, which I have been a witness of lately\r\n    in London.
