O. Lawrence to\r\npropose a much more powerful accelerator, one which could produce new\r\ntypes of nuclear rearrangements and even create particles. Grants\r\ntotaling $1,225,000 permitted work to start on the 184-inch cyclotron in\r\nAugust 1940.[1] It was designed to accelerate atomic particles to an\r\nenergy of 100 million electron volts (Mev), five times that possible\r\nwith the 60-inch machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. The electromagnet under construction during the\r\nperiod 1940 to 1942.]\r\n\r\nBefore the new cyclotron could be finished World War II began.\r\nConstruction on the cyclotron was therefore halted. However, because of\r\ninterest in separating the isotopes of uranium by the electromagnetic\r\nmethod, work on the giant magnet continued at an even faster pace. This\r\nmagnet would contain 3700 tons of steel in its yoke and pole pieces, and\r\n300 tons of copper in its exciting coils (Fig. 1). By May 1942 the\r\nmagnet was completed. During that summer it was used in a pilot plant to\r\nseparate the first significant amounts of U^{235} ever obtained. The\r\n184-inch magnet remained in use in a research and development program at\r\nBerkeley until the end of the war, supplying information to Oak Ridge,\r\nTennessee, where a large separation plant had been erected.\r\n\r\nConstruction on the rest of the cyclotron was resumed in 1945. By that\r\ntime a new principle had been discovered which made it possible to\r\nobtain ion beams of much higher energy than originally hoped for. Yet a\r\nconsiderably lower accelerating voltage could be used. This important\r\ndiscovery was made independently by Dr. V. Veksler in Russia and by\r\nDr. Edwin M. McMillan, present Director of the Lawrence Radiation\r\nLaboratory. Before attempting to discuss this principle, we should first\r\nreview the operation of a conventional cyclotron.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPLE OF OPERATION OF A CONVENTIONAL CYCLOTRON\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. Basic parts of a cyclotron.]\r\n\r\nThe main parts of a cyclotron are represented in Fig. 2. Charged\r\nparticles (ions) are accelerated inside an evacuated tank. This is to\r\nprevent the beam from colliding with air molecules and being scattered.\r\nThe vacuum tank is placed between the poles of an electromagnet, whose\r\nfield bends the ion beam into a circular orbit.\r\n\r\nThe operation begins when the ions are introduced into the region\r\nbetween two accelerating electrodes, or \"dees.\"[2] Because the ions\r\ncarry a positive electric charge, they are attracted toward that dee\r\nwhich is electrically negative at the moment. Were it not for the\r\nmagnetic field, the ions would be accelerated in a straight line;\r\ninstead they are deflected into a circular path back toward the dee gap.\r\nBy the time the ions again reach the dee gap, the sign of the electric\r\npotential on the dees is reversed, so that now the ions are attracted\r\ntoward the opposite dee.\r\n\r\nAs this process of alternating the electric potential is repeated, the\r\nions gain speed and energy with each revolution. This causes them to\r\nspiral outward. Finally they strike a target inserted into their path or\r\nare extracted from the cyclotron for use as an external beam.\r\n\r\nThe time required for an ion to complete one loop remains constant as it\r\nspirals outward. This is because its velocity increases sufficiently to\r\nmake up for the increased distance it travels during each turn. This\r\nmeans that the electric potential applied to the dees must alternate at\r\na constant frequency, called the \"resonant frequency.\"\r\n\r\nThe resonant frequency f is given by the relationship\r\n\r\n            He\r\n    f = --------- ,                                      (1)\r\n         2[pi]mc\r\n\r\nwhere H, e, [pi], c, and m are constants. H is the strength of the\r\nmagnetic field of the cyclotron, e is the electric charge carried by the\r\nion, [pi] equals 3.14, c is a conversion factor, and m is the mass of\r\nthe ion. For example, the resonant frequency for protons accelerated in\r\na 15,000-gauss magnetic field is 23.7 megacycles (Mc).[3] We call such a\r\nrapidly alternating potential a \"radiofrequency voltage\" and the\r\nelectronic circuit for producing it a \"radiofrequency oscillator.\"\r\n\r\nThe energy E of an ion emerging from the cyclotron is given by\r\n\r\n        H^2 R^2   e^2\r\n    E = -------  ---- ,                                  (2)\r\n           2     mc^2\r\n\r\nwhere H, e, and m are as defined above, and R is the radius at which the\r\nbeam is extracted. From this equation we see that for a given type of\r\nion (where e and m are constant), the energy depends on the diameter and\r\nstrength of the magnet, but not directly upon the voltage applied to the\r\ndees.\r\n\r\nThe number of revolutions that an ion can make in a conventional\r\ncyclotron is limited to about 70 to 100. This is due to a very curious\r\neffect: as an ion is accelerated, its mass increases! [This phenomenon\r\nis explained by Einstein's special theory of relativity (see Fig. 3).]\r\nReferring back to Eq. (1), we see that if the ion mass (m) does not\r\nremain constant, but rather increases, then the resonant frequency (f)\r\ndecreases. But since the dee potential continues alternating at a\r\nconstant frequency, an ion soon begins to arrive \"late\" at the dee gap.\r\nBy the time it has made about 70 to 100 turns an ion is so badly out of\r\nphase that it is no longer accelerated.\r\n\r\nSuppose now that we want to obtain an energy of 10 Mev. Because an ion\r\ncan make a maximum of about 100 turns, the accelerating potential would\r\nhave to be about 100,000 volts. However, Professor Lawrence hoped to\r\nreach 100 Mev with the new 184-inch cyclotron. This meant that the\r\naccelerating voltage would have to be about 1,000,000 volts. Preventing\r\nsuch a high voltage from sparking promised to be one of many formidable\r\nengineering problems.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. Graph showing how the mass of an object increases\r\nas its velocity approaches that of light.]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The grants were as follows: Rockefeller Foundation--$1,150,000; John\r\nand Mary Markle Foundation--$25,000; The Research Corporation--$50,000.\r\nThe University of California added a guarantee of $175,000 to bring the\r\ntotal building fund to $1,400,000.\r\n\r\n[2] In the first cyclotrons the electrodes were shaped like the letter\r\n\"D.\"\r\n\r\n[3] We have the values H = 15,000 gauss, e = 4.8 x 10^{-10}\r\nelectrostatic units, and m = 1.6 x 10^{-24} gram. To find f, we write\r\n\r\n        15,000 (4.8) 10^{-10}\r\n    f = ---------------------------------- ,\r\n        2 (3.14)(1.6) 10^{-24} (3) 10^{10}\r\n\r\n    f = 23.7 Mc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCIPLE OF PHASE STABILITY\r\n\r\n\r\nFortunately, Drs. Veksler and McMillan showed that relatively low dee\r\nvoltages can be used to accelerate ions to very high energies. This is\r\npossible if the oscillator frequency is continuously decreased to keep\r\nit in synchronism with the decreasing rotational frequency of the ions.\r\nThis would allow an ion to make many revolutions without becoming out of\r\nphase. This principle of phase stability was experimentally verified\r\nwith the 37-inch cyclotron before being incorporated into the design of\r\nthe 184-inch machine. Because it utilizes this principle, this machine\r\nhas usually been referred to as a \"synchrocyclotron\" or\r\n\"frequency-modulated cyclotron.\" However, it is sometimes called simply\r\na \"cyclotron.\"\r\n\r\nThe 184-inch synchrocyclotron was first operated in November 1946. With\r\na maximum dee voltage of only 20,000 volts, it accelerated deuterons to\r\n190 Mev and alpha particles to 380 Mev.[4] In 1949 it was modified to\r\npermit production of 350-Mev protons also.\r\n\r\nBetween 1955 and 1957 the synchrocyclotron was rebuilt so that now the\r\nfollowing energies can be obtained:\r\n\r\n    Protons  Deuterons  Alpha Particles  Helium-3 nuclei[5]\r\n    -------  ---------  ---------------  ---------------\r\n    730 Mev   460 Mev       910 Mev         1140 Mev\r\n\r\nIn reaching an energy of 730 Mev a proton, for example, makes 75,000\r\nrevolutions in just 6 milliseconds (msec). It travels a distance of 450\r\nmiles and attains a velocity of 152,000 miles per second, or 82% of the\r\nspeed of light! During this brief journey its mass increases 75%, giving\r\nvery convincing evidence for the validity of Einstein's theory. Similar\r\ndata for other ions may be found in the appendix.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] A deuteron is the nucleus of an atom of heavy hydrogen and contains\r\none proton and one neutron; it carries a single positive electric\r\ncharge. An alpha particle is the nucleus of a helium atom and is made up\r\nof two protons and two neutrons; it carries two positive charges.\r\n\r\n[5] The machine is equipped for helium-3 operation, but to date it has\r\nnot been used for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE 184-INCH SYNCHROCYCLOTRON\r\n\r\n\r\n_Magnet_\r\n\r\nDuring the rebuilding of the cyclotron, the diameter of the magnet pole\r\npieces was increased from 184 to 188-3/4 inches. Also, the pole gap at\r\nthe center was reduced from 21 to 14 inches. These changes increased the\r\nweight of steel in the magnet from 3700 to 4000 tons.\r\n\r\nThe main exciting coils, which contain 1300 turns of copper-bar\r\nconductor each, were not altered. Two auxiliary coils containing 425\r\nturns each were added. This brought the total weight of copper from 300\r\nto 340 tons. The coils are layer-wound around the pole pieces close to\r\nthe pole gap. Other data about the coils are given in the appendix.\r\n\r\nThe effect of these modifications was to increase the field strength at\r\nthe center of the pole gap from 15,000 to 23,400 gauss. This increase\r\nmade it possible to obtain the higher-energy ions.\r\n\r\nPower is supplied to the coils by two motor generator sets, which\r\nproduce the direct current required for a steady magnetic field. The\r\ndirect current from the motor generators is regulated so that the\r\nmagnetic-field fluctuation is less than one part in 10,000. This is\r\nnecessary if one wants an external beam of nearly uniform energy.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent the beam from becoming unstable and striking the\r\ndee, the magnetic field must be strongest at the center and decrease\r\nradially (Fig. 4a). With flat pole faces the field does not decrease\r\nuniformly. To give the desired rate of decrease, the pole faces are\r\nshimmed with concentric steel rings of varying thickness, as shown in\r\nFig. 4b. In a radially decreasing magnetic field, the lines of magnetic\r\nflux bow outward, as represented in Fig. 4b. Ions moving in a magnetic\r\nfield are deflected at right angles to these flux lines. Ions above the\r\nmidplane of the cyclotron are directed downward; those below the\r\nmidplane are directed upward. In this way an ion oscillates about the\r\nmidplane and vertical focusing is achieved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.\r\n\r\n(a) Plot of magnetic-field strength vs radius. The field strength\r\ndecreases gradually out to a radius of about 83-in., after which it\r\nfalls off sharply. This point marks the maximum usable radius for\r\nparticle orbits. Further out they are unstable.\r\n\r\n(b) Magnetic flux lines are represented as broken arrows, and focusing\r\nforces as solid arrows. An ion above the midplane is directed downward,\r\nwhile an ion below the midplane is directed upward.]\r\n\r\nRadial focusing is accomplished in a somewhat analogous manner. If the\r\nmagnetic field decreases with radius, radial restoring forces are\r\nestablished. An ion at too large a radius is directed inward, and an ion\r\nat too small a radius is directed outward. In this fashion, the ion\r\noscillates about the synchronous orbit. Thus, radial focusing is\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vacuum System_\r\n\r\nThe vacuum tank (acceleration chamber) is a steel box 20 x 25 ft and 4 ft\r\nhigh. It is evacuated to a pressure of 10^{-5} millimeter of mercury\r\n(about one 100-millionth of atmospheric pressure). The pumping equipment\r\nconsists of six oil-diffusion pumps and four mechanical vacuum pumps.\r\nThe pumping speed of the six 20-in. oil-diffusion pumps is a total of\r\n20,000 liters/sec.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ion Source_\r\n\r\nThe ion source is a simple arc-type. Hydrogen gas is allowed to leak\r\ninto the ion-source enclosure near a tungsten filament, which is heated\r\nto incandescence. Electrons emitted by the filament knock off electrons\r\nfrom hydrogen atoms, leaving free protons. The protons then escape into\r\nthe acceleration chamber through a hole in the ion-source housing. Once\r\ninside, the protons are accelerated by the dee potential.\r\n\r\nDeuterons or alpha particles are obtained in a similar fashion using\r\ndeuterium or helium gas in place of hydrogen.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Radiofrequency System_\r\n\r\nThe 184-inch synchrocyclotron has a single dee instead of the double-dee\r\narrangement described above for illustrative purposes. The accelerating\r\nelectric field is developed between the dee and a dummy dee which is\r\ngrounded to the vacuum tank. Using a single dee does not change the\r\nprinciple of operation, yet it offers the advantage of allowing more\r\nspace for auxiliary equipment inside the vacuum tank. Also, the\r\nconstruction is much simpler. The dummy dee is not essential for\r\noperation, but it does improve performance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. Radiofrequency cycle for accelerating protons.\r\nSixty-four such cycles are repeated each second.]\r\n\r\nRadiofrequency power is supplied to the dee by a vacuum-tube\r\noscillator. The frequency of oscillation must decrease during the\r\nacceleration cycle, as indicated above. For protons, the frequency at\r\nthe start of acceleration is 36 megacycles (Mc). At the end of\r\nacceleration the frequency is only 18 Mc (see Fig. 5). This change in\r\nfrequency is achieved by varying the electrical capacitance in the tuned\r\ncircuit of the oscillator. (This is what you do when you dial a\r\ndifferent station on a radio.) This tuned circuit, which is called the\r\ncyclotron resonator, is shown in Fig. 6.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. Cyclotron resonator.]\r\n\r\nBecause the frequency must change over such a wide range (from 36 to 18\r\nMc), the electrical capacitance must be varied by a factor of 20 to 1.\r\nThis is done by a variable capacitor of unique design. It resembles two\r\ngiant tuning forks. As the blades of the tuning forks vibrate, the\r\ncapacitance is alternately increased and decreased by the required\r\namount.\r\n\r\nThese two tuning forks must be kept in step with great precision. This\r\nis to prevent the oscillator from exciting lateral rf resonances. With a\r\ncyclotron of this size, this is a problem. These resonances, if excited,\r\nwould cause loss of beam. The method for keeping the blades moving\r\ntogether is as follows: The blades are made to vibrate at their resonant\r\nfrequency, which is approximately 64 cycles per second. One set of\r\nblades operates at its natural frequency as a tuning-fork oscillator.\r\nThe second set of blades is driven from an amplified sample of the\r\nsignal from the first; its natural period is adjusted automatically to\r\nequal that of the first. The amplitude of each set is regulated to\r\nwithin 0.003 in.; the phase angle between the blades is regulated to\r\nwithin 1 deg.\r\n\r\nIons are accelerated only when the radiofrequency is decreasing (Fig. 5).\r\nThe remaining portion of the cycle is \"dead time.\" Thus, 64 pulses, each\r\nof about 500 microseconds' duration, are obtained every second. The\r\naverage ion current of a pulsed beam is much less than for a continuous\r\nbeam, such as that obtained from a conventional cyclotron (see Table I).\r\nThis is part of the price paid for higher energies.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Internal Targets and Beam Extractor_\r\n\r\nThe simplest target is one placed inside the vacuum tank where the\r\ncirculating beam will strike it. The target may be any substance that\r\nthe physicist or chemist wants to irradiate. The target material is\r\nattached to a movable probe. If the experimenter wants to use the\r\nfull-energy beam, he places the target at the maximum usable radius of\r\nthe circulating beam (82 inches). However, if he desires to use ions\r\nhaving less than the maximum energy, he inserts the target further into\r\nthe cyclotron so that it is intercepted sooner.\r\n\r\nTABLE I\r\n\r\n=============================================================\r\n   Comparison of external-beam energy and current for a\r\n     synchrocyclotron and a conventional cyclotron\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                  184-Inch Synchrocyclotron\r\n                  -------------------------\r\n\r\n                          Protons  Deuterons  Alpha particles\r\n                          -------  ---------  ---------------\r\nBeam energy --\r\n  maximum (Mev)              730       460           910\r\n\r\nBeam intensity --\r\n  peak current ([mu]a)[6]    120       120            40\r\n\r\nBeam intensity --\r\n  average current ([mu]a)   0.75      0.75          0.25\r\n\r\n                      60-Inch Cyclotron\r\n                      -----------------\r\nBeam energy --\r\n  maximum (Mev)               12        24            48\r\n\r\nBeam intensity --\r\n  peak current ([mu]a)       100       150           100\r\n\r\nBeam intensity --\r\n  average current ([mu]a)     70        80            60\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    [6] [mu]a = microampere\r\n=============================================================\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. Plan view of the cyclotron, showing the method\r\nfor obtaining an external beam of protons, deuterons, or alpha\r\nparticles.]\r\n\r\nSome experiments require an external beam of protons, deuterons, or\r\nalpha particles. A beam of this type can be brought out of the machine\r\nby means of a LeCouteur regenerator (Fig. 7). The construction of the\r\nregenerator is very simple. It is made of a number of steel laminations\r\nof various sizes. What the regenerator does is perturb the magnetic\r\nfield of the cyclotron at one radial position. Each time the beam passes\r\nthrough the regenerator it receives a kick. With each kick the beam\r\nbuilds up its radial amplitude, until finally it enters a magnetic\r\nchannel. This channel focuses the beam and steers it outside the main\r\nmagnetic field. Once outside, the beam travels through an evacuated\r\ntube, which is integral with the main vacuum tank. By means of a\r\nsteering magnet, the beam can be sent into either the physics cave or\r\nthe medical cave. (These experimental areas are called \"caves\" because\r\nthey are rooms inside the massive concrete shielding wall.)\r\n\r\nOther experiments may require an external beam of mesons.[7] A meson\r\nbeam is obtained in the following way (Fig. 8): A movable target such as\r\na block of carbon is placed inside the cyclotron near the end of the\r\noutward-spiraling proton beam. When the proton beam hits this target, a\r\nshower of mesons is produced. These mesons are bent in various\r\ndirections by the main magnetic field. Some of them pass through a thin\r\nmetal window in the vacuum-tank wall and are focused by a magnetic lens\r\ninto a beam. This meson beam then travels through a hole in the concrete\r\nshielding wall into the meson cave. The maximum intensity of this\r\nextracted meson beam depends on both the charge and energy desired.\r\nBeams of more than 100,000 mesons per second have been obtained through\r\nan aperture 4 x 4 in. in the shielding wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCYCLOTRON EXPERIMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nuclear Physics_\r\n\r\nAbout 86% of the operating time of the 184-inch synchrocyclotron is\r\ndevoted to experiments in nuclear physics. Most of the experiments study\r\nthe production and interaction of [pi] mesons. These particles are\r\nconsidered to be essential factors in the intense but short-range forces\r\nthat bind the nucleus together. The three types of [pi] mesons are\r\ndesignated according to their electric charge as [pi]^+, [pi]^0, and\r\n[pi]^-.[8] These mesons materialize only in high-energy nuclear\r\ncollisions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. Method for obtaining external meson beam.]\r\n\r\nOf great importance are those experiments that determine the\r\nprobability of producing each of the three types of mesons in a nuclear\r\ncollision. This type of experiment is repeated for different beam\r\nenergies and target elements. Other experiments measure the energy and\r\ndirection of emission of [pi] mesons from a target.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. A typical experiment. Scintillation counters at\r\nA, B, C, D, and E record the passage of charged particles.]\r\n\r\nA typical [pi]-meson experiment is represented in Fig. 9. The purpose\r\nof this experiment was to detect the spin directions of protons as they\r\nare knocked out of a liquid hydrogen target by a [pi]-meson beam. (Like\r\nthe earth, a proton spins on its axis.) An extracted proton beam from\r\nthe cyclotron enters the physics cave from the left, striking a\r\npolyethylene target and producing [pi] mesons. A beam of these mesons is\r\nformed by a series of two bending magnets and three focusing magnets.\r\nThis beam passes through a carbon absorber to remove unwanted particles.\r\nThe meson beam then strikes the liquid hydrogen target. A few of the\r\nincoming mesons scatter, knocking protons out of the liquid hydrogen.\r\nScintillation counters at A and B record the passage of a proton, thus\r\ndefining its direction. The scattered mesons are counted by a\r\nscintillation counter at C. A few of the protons scatter off the carbon\r\ntarget and are detected by counters at E and D. From the detection of\r\nsuch events, the spin directions (polarization) of the recoil protons\r\ncan be analyzed. In this way, more is learned about the fundamental\r\n[pi]-proton interaction.\r\n\r\nFurther studies of the interactions of [pi] mesons are made in the meson\r\ncave. Other experiments performed there are concerned with [mu] mesons.\r\nThe [mu] meson (muon) is a particle created in the decay of a [pi] meson\r\nand is the principal constituent of cosmic rays striking the surface of\r\nthe earth. The muon is unstable, eventually undergoing a radioactive\r\ndecay into an electron. Although the muon does not experience nuclear\r\nforces, it can interact weakly with nuclei. The behavior of the muon is\r\nwell understood, but its role as one of the elementary particles is\r\nunknown. That is, if the muon did not exist, what effect would this have\r\non the structure of matter? The answer to this question, among others,\r\nis being sought by physicists using the 184-inch cyclotron.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Biophysics_\r\n\r\nExperiments in biophysics are conducted in the medical cave. In these\r\nthe interest lies not in nuclear interactions but in the effect of\r\nionizing radiation on living tissue. High-energy beams of particles can\r\nbe used for selective destruction of specific areas of the brain. This\r\npermits physiological mapping of the functions of the brain in\r\nexperimental animals. It further offers a therapeutic approach to the\r\ntreatment of brain tumors. One of the important investigational programs\r\nis concerned with the relationship of the pituitary gland to the growth\r\nrate of certain cancers and to some endocrine disorders.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nuclear Chemistry_\r\n\r\nFor techniques of radiochemistry to be employed successfully, high\r\ninteraction rates (and therefore high beam intensities) are needed. For\r\nthis reason, chemistry targets are usually inserted right into the\r\ncyclotron so that they can be bombarded directly by the circulating\r\nbeam. After the bombardment is completed the target is removed from the\r\ncyclotron. It is then taken to a chemistry laboratory and subjected to\r\ndetailed chemical procedures. Individual elements are removed, and the\r\nradioactive isotopes of each element are identified by quantitative\r\ncounting techniques. In some cases a mass spectrometer is used to\r\nanalyze the products. Many deductions about the nature of the breakup of\r\nthe target nucleus can be drawn from the pattern of the observed\r\nradioactive products. Sometimes the nucleus splits almost in half. This\r\nis called fission. More frequently smaller parts of the nucleus are\r\nsplit off. Two general types of reactions, known as spallation and\r\nfragmentation, are distinguished. One of the goals of this research is\r\nto learn more about the constitution of the nucleus and of the forces\r\nwhich bind the particles in the interior of the nucleus.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] Mesons are elementary particles intermediate in mass between the\r\nelectron and proton.\r\n\r\n[8] It may be interesting to note that the [pi]^0 meson was discovered\r\nwith this cyclotron in 1950. This was the first particle to be\r\ndiscovered with an accelerator. All particles that had been previously\r\ndiscovered were observed first in cosmic rays or some other form of\r\nnatural radiation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Gerald A.
