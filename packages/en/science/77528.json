He has been copy or managing editor of the\r\n  Salem, Oregon, Statesman, Portland Journal, Tacoma Times, Seattle\r\n  Star and the Santa Rosa, California, Press-Democrat. His stories\r\n  have appeared in_ COLLIER’S _and_ ESQUIRE, _and a number of science\r\n  fiction magazines. There’s prophetic magic in this star-bright tale\r\n  of tomorrow._\r\n\r\n  =The Nothings stemmed from the future’s tragic lack of courage. But\r\n  one man and woman dared to shape a more audacious tomorrow.=\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it hadn’t been for the fight with my father I’d never have gone\r\ndown to the Tavern and then I wouldn’t have met the _Nothing_. This\r\n_Nothing_ was really just an ordinary looking guy. He wasn’t worth\r\nspecial attention unless, like me, you were pretending you were Marla\r\nGraim, the feelies star, and him Sidney Harch meeting you in the bar to\r\ngive you a spy capsule.\r\n\r\nIt was all my father’s fault. Imagine him getting angry because I\r\nwouldn’t take a job burning brush. What kind of work is that for an\r\neighteen-year-old girl anyway? I know my folks were hard pressed for\r\nmoney but that was no excuse for the way he lit into me.\r\n\r\nWe had the fight over lunch but it was after six o’clock before I got\r\nthe chance to sneak out of the house. I went down to the Tavern because\r\nI knew the old man would be madder than a tele in a lead barrel when\r\nhe found out. There was no way I could keep it from him, of course. He\r\npried me every time I came home.\r\n\r\nThe Tavern is a crossroads place where the talent gets together to\r\ncompare notes, and talk about jobs. I’d only been in there once before,\r\nand that time with my father. He warned me not to go there alone\r\nbecause a lot of the jags used the place. You could smell the stuff all\r\nover the main room. There was pink smoke from a hyro bowl drifting up\r\naround the rafters. Someone had a Venusian Oin filter going. There was\r\na lot of talent there for so early in the evening.\r\n\r\nI found an empty corner of the bar and ordered a blue fire because I’d\r\nseen Marla Graim ask for one in the feelies. The bartender stared at me\r\nsharply and I suspected he was a tele, but he didn’t pry. After awhile\r\nhe floated my drink up to me and ’ported away my money. I sipped the\r\ndrink the way I’d seen Marla Graim do, but it was too sweet. I tried\r\nnot to let my face show anything.\r\n\r\nThe bar mirror gave me a good broad view of the room and I kept\r\nlooking into it as though I was expecting somebody. Then this big\r\nblond young man came through the front door. I saw him in the mirror\r\nand immediately knew he was going to take the seat beside me. I’m not\r\nexactly a prescient, but sometimes those things are obvious.\r\n\r\nHe came across the room, moving with a gladiator ease between the\r\npacked tables. That’s when I pretended I was Marla Graim waiting at a\r\nPort Said bar to pick up a spy capsule from Sidney Harch like in the\r\nfeelie I’d seen Sunday. This fellow did look a little like Harch--curly\r\nhair, dark blue eyes, face all sharp angles as if it had been chiseled\r\nby a sculptor who’d left the job uncompleted.\r\n\r\nHe took the stool beside me as I’d known he would, and ordered a blue\r\nfire, easy on the sugar. Naturally, I figured this was a get-acquainted\r\ngambit and wondered what to say to him. Suddenly, it struck me as an\r\nexciting idea to just ride along with the Marla Graim plot until it\r\ncame time to leave.\r\n\r\nHe couldn’t do anything to stop me even if he was a ’porter. You see,\r\nI’m a pyro and that’s a good enough defense for anyone. I glanced down\r\nat my circa-twenty skirt and shifted until the slit exposed my garter\r\nthe way I’d seen Marla Graim do it. This blond lad didn’t give it a\r\ntumble. He finished his drink, and ordered another.\r\n\r\nI whiffed him for one of the cokes, but he was dry. No jag. The other\r\nstuff in the room was getting through to me, though, and I was feeling\r\ndizzy. I knew I’d have to leave soon and I’d never get another chance\r\nto be a Marla Graim type; so I said, “What’s yours?”\r\n\r\nOh, he knew I was talking to him all right, but he didn’t even look up.\r\nIt made me mad. A girl has some pride and there I’d unbent enough to\r\nstart the conversation! There was an ashtray piled with scraps of paper\r\nin front of him. I concentrated on it and the paper suddenly flamed.\r\nI’m a good pyro when I want to be. Some men have been kind enough to\r\nsay I could start a fire without the talent. But with a prying father\r\nlike mine how would I ever know?\r\n\r\nThe fire got this fellow’s attention. He knew I’d started it. He just\r\nglanced at me once and turned away. “Leave me alone,” he said. “I’m a\r\n_Nothing._”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI don’t know what it was. Maybe I have a little of the tele like that\r\ndoctor said once, but I knew he was telling the truth. It wasn’t one\r\nof those gags like you see in the feelies. You know--where there are\r\ntwo comedians and one says, “What’s yours?” And the other one answers,\r\n“Nothing.”\r\n\r\nOnly all the time he’s levitating the other guy’s chair and juggling\r\nhalf a dozen things behind his back, no hands. You know the gag. It’s\r\nbeen run into the ground. Well, when he said that, it kind of set me\r\nback. I’d never seen a real-life _Nothing_ before. Oh, I knew there\r\nwere some. In the government preserves and such, but I’d never been\r\nlike this--right next to one.\r\n\r\n“Sorry,” I said. “I’m a pyro.”\r\n\r\nHe glanced at the ashes in the tray and said, “Yeah. I know.”\r\n\r\n“There’s not much work for pyros any more,” I said. “It’s the only\r\ntalent I have.” I turned and looked at him. Handsome in spite of being\r\na _Nothing_. “What did you do?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“I ran away,” he said. “I’m a fugitive from the Sonoma Preserve.”\r\n\r\nThat made my blood tingle. Not only a _Nothing_, but a fugitive, too.\r\nJust like in the feelies. I said, “Do you want to hide out at my place?”\r\n\r\nThat brought him around. He looked me over and he actually blushed.\r\nActually! I’d never seen a man blush before. That fellow certainly was\r\nloaded with firsts for me.\r\n\r\n“People might get the wrong idea when I’m caught,” he said. “I’m sure\r\nto be caught eventually. I always am.”\r\n\r\nI was really getting a feeling for that woman-of-the-world part. “Why\r\nnot enjoy your freedom then?” I asked.\r\n\r\nI let him see a little more through the circa-twenty slit. He actually\r\nturned away! Imagine!\r\n\r\nThat’s when the police came. They didn’t make any fuss. I’d noticed\r\nthese two men standing just inside the door watching us. Only I’d\r\nthought they were watching me. They came across the room and one of\r\nthem bent over this fellow.\r\n\r\n“All right, Claude,” he said. “Come quietly.”\r\n\r\nThe other took my arm and said, “You’ll have to come, too, sister.”\r\n\r\nI jerked away from him. “I’m not your sister,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Oh, leave her alone, fellows,” said this Claude. “I didn’t tell her\r\nanything. She was just trying to pick me up.”\r\n\r\n“Sorry,” said the cop. “She comes, too.”\r\n\r\nThat’s when I began to get scared. “Look,” I said. “I don’t know what\r\nthis is all about.”\r\n\r\nThe man showed me the snout of a hypo gun in his pocket. “Stop the\r\ncommotion and come quietly, sister, or I’ll have to use this,” he said.\r\n\r\nSo who wants to go to sleep? I went quietly, praying we’d run into my\r\nfather or someone I knew so I could explain things. But no such luck.\r\n\r\nThe police had a plain old jet buggy outside with people clustered\r\naround looking at it. A ’porter in the crowd was having fun jiggling\r\nthe rear end up and down off the ground. He was standing back with his\r\nhands in his pockets, grinning.\r\n\r\nThe cop who’d done all the talking just looked toward this ’porter and\r\nthe fellow lost his grin and hurried away. I knew then the cop was a\r\ntele, although he hadn’t touched my mind. They’re awfully sensitive\r\nabout their code of ethics, some of those teles.\r\n\r\nIt was fun riding in that old jet buggy. I’d never been in one before.\r\nOne of the cops got in back with Claude and me. The other one drove.\r\nIt was the strangest feeling flying up over the bay on the tractors.\r\nUsually, whenever I wanted to go someplace, I’d just ask, polite like,\r\nwas there a ’porter around and then I’d think of where I wanted to go\r\nand the ’porter would set me down there quick as a wink.\r\n\r\nOf course, I wound up in some old gent’s apartment now and then. Some\r\n’porters do that sort of thing for a fee. But a pyro doesn’t have to\r\nworry about would-be Casanovas. No old gent is going to fool around\r\nwhen his clothes are on fire.\r\n\r\nWell, the jet buggy finally set down on an old hospital grounds way\r\nback up in the sticks and the cops took us to the main building\r\nand into a little office. Walking, mind you. It was shady in the\r\noffice--not enough lights--and it took a minute for my eyes to adjust\r\nafter the bright lights in the hall. When they did adjust and I saw\r\nthe old codger behind the desk I did a real double take. It was Mensor\r\nWilliams. Yeah. The _Big All_. Anything anybody else can do he can do\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nSomebody worked a switch somewhere and the lights brightened. “Good\r\nevening, Miss Carlysle,” he said and his little goatee bobbled.\r\n\r\nBefore I could make a crack about ethics against reading minds, he\r\nsaid, “I’m not intruding into your mental processes. I’ve merely\r\nscanned forward to a point where I learn your name.”\r\n\r\nA prescient, too!\r\n\r\n“There really wasn’t any need to bring her,” he told the cops. “But\r\nit was inevitable that you would.” Then he did the funniest thing.\r\nHe turned to Claude and nodded his head toward me. “How do you like\r\nher, Claude?” he asked. Just like I was something offered for sale or\r\nsomething!\r\n\r\nClaude said, “Is she the one, Dad?”\r\n\r\nDad! That one smacked me. The _Big All_ has a kid and the kid’s a\r\n_Nothing_!\r\n\r\n“She’s the one,” said Williams.\r\n\r\nClaude kind of squared his shoulders and said, “Well, I’m going to\r\nthrow a stick into the works. I won’t do it!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you will,” said Williams.\r\n\r\nThis was all way over my head and I’d had about enough anyway. I said,\r\n“Now wait a minute, gentlemen, or I’ll set the place on fire! I mean\r\nliterally!”\r\n\r\n“She can do it, too,” said Claude, grinning at his father.\r\n\r\n“But she won’t,” said Williams.\r\n\r\n“Oh, won’t I?” I said. “Well, you just try and stop me!”\r\n\r\n“No need to do that,” said Williams. “I’ve seen what’s going to happen.”\r\n\r\nJust like that! These prescients give me the creeps. Sometimes I wonder\r\nif they don’t give themselves the creeps. Living for them must be like\r\nrepeating a part you already know. Not for me. I said, “What would\r\nhappen if I did something different from what you’d seen?”\r\n\r\nWilliams leaned forward with an interested look in his eyes. “It’s\r\nnever happened,” he said. “If it did happen once, that’d be a real\r\nprecedent.”\r\n\r\nI can’t be sure, but looking at him there, I got the idea he’d really\r\nbe interested to see something happen different from his forecast. I\r\nthought of starting a little fire, maybe in the papers on his desk. But\r\nsomehow the idea didn’t appeal to me. It wasn’t that any presence was\r\nin my mind telling me not to. I don’t know exactly what it was. I just\r\ndidn’t _want_ to do it. I said, “What’s the meaning of all this double\r\ntalk?”\r\n\r\nThe old man leaned back and I swear he seemed kind of disappointed. He\r\nsaid, “It’s just that you and Claude are going to be married.”\r\n\r\nI opened my mouth to speak and nothing came out. Finally, I managed to\r\nstammer, “You mean you’ve looked into the future and seen us _married_?\r\nHow many kids we’re going to have and everything like that?”\r\n\r\n“Well, not everything,” he said. “All things in the future aren’t clear\r\nto us. Only certain main-line developments. And we can’t see too far\r\ninto the future for most things. The past is easier. That’s been fixed\r\nimmovably.”\r\n\r\n“And what if we don’t want to?” asked Claude.\r\n\r\n“Yeah,” I said. “What about that?” But I have to admit the idea wasn’t\r\ntotally repulsive. As I’ve said, Claude looked like Sidney Harch, only\r\nyounger. He had something--you can call it animal magnetism if you wish.\r\n\r\nThe old man just smiled. “Miss Carlysle,” he said, “do you honestly\r\nobject to--”\r\n\r\n“As long as I’m going to be in the family you can call me Jean,” I said.\r\n\r\nI was beginning to feel fatalistic about the whole thing. My great aunt\r\nHarriet was a prescient and I’d had experience with them. Now I was\r\nremembering the time she told me my kitty was going to die and I hid\r\nit in the old cistern and that night it rained and filled the cistern.\r\nNaturally the kitty drowned. I never forgave her for not telling me how\r\nthe kitty was going to die.\r\n\r\nOld Williams looked at me and said, “At least _you’re_ being\r\nreasonable.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not,” said Claude.\r\n\r\nSo I told them about my great aunt Harriet.\r\n\r\n“It’s the nature of things,” said Williams. “Why can’t you be as\r\nreasonable as she’s being, son?”\r\n\r\nClaude just sat there with the original stone face.\r\n\r\n“Am I so repulsive?” I asked.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me then. Really looked. I tell you I got warm under it. I\r\nknow I’m not repulsive. Finally, I guess I blushed.\r\n\r\n“You’re not repulsive,” he said. “I just object to having my whole life\r\nordered out for me like a chess set up.”\r\n\r\nStalemate. We sat there for a minute or so, completely silent.\r\nPresently Williams turned to me and said, “Well, Miss Carlysle, I\r\npresume you’re curious about what’s going on here.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not a moron,” I said. “This is one of the _Nothing_ Preserves.”\r\n\r\n“Correct,” he said. “Only it’s more than that. Your education includes\r\nthe knowledge of how our talents developed from radiation mutants. Does\r\nit also include the knowledge of what happens to extremes from the\r\nnorm?”\r\n\r\nEvery schoolkid knows that, of course. So I told him. Sure I knew\r\nthat the direction of development was toward the average. That genius\r\nparents tend to have children less smart than they are. This is just\r\ngeneral information.\r\n\r\nThen the old man threw me the twister. “The talents are disappearing,\r\nmy dear,” he said.\r\n\r\nI just sat there and thought about that for awhile. Certainly I knew\r\nit’d been harder lately to get a ’porter, even one of the old gent kind.\r\n\r\n“Each generation has more children without talents or with talents\r\ngreatly dulled,” said Williams. “We will never reach a point where\r\nthere are absolutely none, but what few remain will be needed for\r\nspecial jobs in the public interest.”\r\n\r\n“You mean if I have kids they’re liable to be _Nothings_?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Look at your own family,” he said. “Your great aunt was a prescient.\r\nHave there been any others in your family?”\r\n\r\n“Well, no, but--”\r\n\r\n“The prescient talent is an extreme,” he said. “There are fewer than a\r\nthousand left. There are nine of us in my category. I believe you refer\r\nto us as the _Big All_.”\r\n\r\n“But we’ve got to do something!” I said. “The world’ll just go to pot!”\r\n\r\n“We _are_ doing something,” he said. “Right here and on eight other\r\npreserves scattered around the world. We’re reviving the mechanical\r\nand tool skills which supported the pretalent civilization and we’re\r\nstoring the instruments which will make a rebirth of that civilization\r\npossible.”\r\n\r\nHe raised a warning hand. “But we must move in secrecy. The world’s not\r\nyet ready for this information. It would cause a most terrible panic if\r\nthis were to become known.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you’re prescient. What does happen?” I asked him.\r\n“Unfortunately, none of us are able to determine that,” he said.\r\n“Either it’s an unfixed line or there’s some interference which we\r\ncan’t surmount.” He shook his head and the goatee wiggled. “There’s a\r\ncloudy area in the near future beyond which we can’t see. None of us.”\r\n\r\nThat scared me. A prescient may give you the creeps, but it’s nice to\r\nknow there’s a future into which someone can see. It was as if there\r\nsuddenly wasn’t any future--period. I began to cry a little.\r\n\r\n“And our children will be _Nothings_,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Well, not exactly,” said Williams. “Some of them, maybe, but we’ve\r\ntaken the trouble of comparing your gene lines--yours and Claude’s.\r\nYou’ve a good chance of having offspring who will be prescient or\r\ntelepathic or both. A better than seventy percent chance.”\r\n\r\nHis voice got pleading. “The world’s going to need that chance.”\r\n\r\nClaude came over and put a hand on my shoulder. It sent a delicious\r\ntingle up my spine. Suddenly, I got a little flash of his thoughts-a\r\npicture of us kissing. I’m not really a tele, but like I said,\r\nsometimes I get glimmers.\r\n\r\nClaude said, “Okay. I guess there’s no sense fighting the inevitable.\r\nWe’ll get married.”\r\n\r\nNo more argument. We all traipsed into another room and there was\r\na preacher with everything ready for us, even the ring. Another\r\nprescient. He’d come more than a hundred miles to perform the ceremony,\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfterward, I let Claude kiss me once. I was having trouble realizing\r\nthat I was married. Mrs. Claude Williams. But that’s the way it is with\r\nthe inevitable, I guess. The old man took my arm then and said there\r\nwas one small precaution. I’d be going off the grounds from time to\r\ntime and there’d always be the chance of some unethical tele picking my\r\nbrains.\r\n\r\nThey put me under an anesthetube and when I came out of it I had a\r\nsilver grid in my skull. It itched some, but they said that it would go\r\naway. I’d heard of this thing. They called it a blanket.\r\n\r\nMensor Williams said, “Now go home and get your things. You won’t need\r\nto tell your parents any more than that you have a government job. Come\r\nback as soon as you’re able.”\r\n\r\n“Get me a ’porter,” I said.\r\n\r\n“The grounds are gridded against teleporters,” he said. “I’ll have to\r\nsend you in a jet buggy.”\r\n\r\nAnd so he did. I was home in ten minutes. I went up the stairs to my\r\nhouse. It was after nine o’clock by then. My father was waiting inside\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n“A fine time for an eighteen-year-old girl to be coming home!” he\r\nshouted and he made a tele stab at my mind to see what I’d been up to.\r\nThese teles and their ethics! Well, he ran smack dab into the blanket\r\nand maybe you think that didn’t set him back on his heels. He got all\r\nquiet suddenly.\r\n\r\nI said, “I have a government job. I just came back for my things.” Time\r\nenough to tell them about the marriage later. They’d have kicked up a\r\nfine rumpus if I’d said anything then.\r\n\r\nMama came in and said, “My little baby with a government job! How much\r\ndoes it pay?”\r\n\r\nI said, “Let’s not be vulgar.” Papa sided with me.\r\n\r\n“Of course not, Hazel,” he said. “Leave the kid alone. A government\r\njob! What do you know! Those things pay plenty. Where is it, baby?”\r\n\r\nI could see him wondering how much he could tap me for to pay his bills\r\nand I began to wonder if I’d have any money at all to keep up the\r\npretense. I said, “The job’s at Sonoma Preserve.”\r\n\r\nPapa said, “What they need with a pyro up there?”\r\n\r\nI got a brilliant inspiration. I said, “To keep the _Nothings_ in line.\r\nA little burn here, a little burn there. You know.”\r\n\r\nThat struck my father funny. When he could stop laughing he said, “I\r\nknow you, honey. I’ve watched your think tank pretty close. You’ll take\r\ncare of yourself and no funny business. Do they have nice safe quarters\r\nfor you up there?”\r\n\r\n“The safest,” I said.\r\n\r\nI felt him take another prod at my blanket and withdraw. “Government\r\nwork is top secret,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Sure. I understand,” he said.\r\n\r\nSo I went to my room and got my things packed. The folks made some more\r\nfuss about my going away so sudden, but they quieted down when I told\r\nthem I had to go at once or lose the chance at the job.\r\n\r\nPapa finally said, “Well, if the government isn’t safe, then nothing\r\nis.”\r\n\r\nThey kissed me goodbye and I promised to write and to visit home on my\r\nfirst free weekend.\r\n\r\n“Don’t worry, Papa,” I said.\r\n\r\nThe jet buggy took me back to the preserve. When I went into the\r\noffice, Claude, my husband, was sitting across the desk from his father.\r\n\r\nThe old man had his hands to his forehead and there were beads of\r\nperspiration showing where the fingers didn’t cover. Presently, he\r\nlowered his hands and shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Well?” asked Claude.\r\n\r\n“Not a thing,” said the old man.\r\n\r\nI moved a little bit into the room but they didn’t notice me.\r\n\r\n“Tell me the truth, Dad,” said Claude. “How far ahead did you see us?”\r\n\r\nOld Mensor Williams lowered his head and sighed. “All right, son,”\r\nhe said. “You deserve the truth. I saw you meet Miss Carlysle at the\r\nTavern and not another thing. We had to trace her by old-fashioned\r\nmethods and compare your gene lines like I said. The rest is truth. You\r\nknow I wouldn’t lie to you.”\r\n\r\nI cleared my throat and they both looked at me.\r\n\r\nClaude jumped out of his chair and faced me. “We can get an annulment,”\r\nhe said. “No one has the right to play with other peoples’ lives like\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\nHe looked so sweet and little-boy-like standing there. I knew suddenly\r\nI didn’t want an annulment. I said, “The younger generation has to\r\naccept its responsibilities sometime.”\r\n\r\nMensor Williams got an eager look in his eyes. I turned to the old man,\r\nsaid, “Was that seventy percent figure correct?”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely correct, my dear,” he said. “We’ve checked every\r\nmarriageable female he’s met because he carries my family’s dominant\r\nline. Your combination was the best. Far higher than we’d hoped for.”\r\n\r\n“Is there anything else you can tell us about our future?” I asked.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. “It’s all cloudy,” he said. “You’re on your own.”\r\n\r\nI got that creepy feeling again and looked up at my husband. Little\r\nlaugh wrinkles creased at the corners of Claude’s eyes and he smiled.\r\nThen another thought struck me. If we were on our own, that meant we\r\nwere shaping our own future. It wasn’t fixed. And no nosey prescient\r\ncould come prying in on us, either. A woman kind of likes that idea.\r\nEspecially on her wedding night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Note:\r\n\r\n\r\nThis etext was produced from Fantastic Universe, January 1956 (Vol. 4,\r\nNo. 6).
