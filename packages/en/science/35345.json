NEW-YORK, APRIL 1, 1852. No. IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM GILMORE SIMMS, LL.D.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nA steadily growing reputation for almost twenty years, justified by the\r\ngradually increasing evidence of those latent, exhaustless,\r\never-unfolding energies which belong to genius, has inwoven the name of\r\nSimms with the literature of America, and made it part of the heirloom\r\nwhich our age will give to posterity. Asking and desiring nothing to\r\nwhich he could not prove himself justly entitled, he has wrested a\r\nreputation from difficulty and obstacle, and conquered an honorable\r\nacknowledgment from opposition and indifference. Even if we had not\r\nproofs of genius in the treasury of thought and imagination constituted\r\nby his writings, still the nobility of the example of energy,\r\nperseverance, and high-toned hopefulness, which he has given, would\r\ndeserve a grateful homage.\r\n\r\nWilliam Gilmore Simms is the second, and only surviving, of three\r\nbrothers, sons of William Gilmore Simms, and Harriet Ann Augusta\r\nSingleton. His father was of a Scotch-Irish family, and his mother of a\r\nVirginia stock, her grandparents having removed to South Carolina long\r\nbefore the Revolution, in which they took an active part on the Whig\r\nside. He was born on the 17th of April, 1806. His mother died when he\r\nwas an infant. His father, failing in business as a merchant, removed\r\nfirst to Tennessee, and then to Mississippi. While in Tennessee he\r\nvolunteered and held a commission in the army of Jackson (in Coffee's\r\nbrigade of mounted men), which scourged the Creeks and Seminoles after\r\nthe massacre of Fort Mims. Our author, left to the care of a\r\ngrandmother, remained in Charleston, where he received an education\r\nwhich circumstances rendered exceedingly limited. He was denied a\r\nclassical training, but such characters stand little in need of the\r\nordinary aids of the schoolmaster, and, with indomitable application, he\r\nhas not only stored his mind with the richest literature, but has\r\nreceived an unsolicited tribute to his diligence and acquisitions, in\r\nthe degree of Doctor of Laws, conferred upon him by the respectable\r\nUniversity of Alabama.\r\n\r\nAt first it was designed that he should study medicine, but his\r\ninclination led him to the law. He was admitted to the bar of South\r\nCarolina when twenty-one, practised for a brief period, and became part\r\nproprietor of a daily newspaper, which, taking ground against\r\nnullification, ruined him--swallowing up a small maternal property, and\r\ninvolving him in a heavy debt which hung upon and embarrassed him for a\r\nlong time after. In 1832, he first visited the North, where he published\r\nAtalantis. Martin Faber followed in 1834, and periodically the long\r\ncatalogue of his subsequent performances.\r\n\r\nThere are few writers who have exhibited such versatility of powers,\r\ncombined with vigor, originality of copious and independent ideas, and\r\nthat faculty of condensation which frequently by a single pregnant line\r\nsuggests an expansive train of reflection. As a poet, he unites high\r\nimaginative powers with metaphysical thought--by which we mean that\r\nlarge discourse of reason which generalizes, and which seizes the\r\nuniversal, and perceives its relations to individual phenomena of nature\r\nand psychology. His poems abound in appropriate, felicitous, and\r\noriginal similes. His keen and fresh perception of nature, furnishes him\r\nwith beautiful pictures, the truthfulness and clearness of which are\r\nadmirably presented in the lucid language with which they are painted,\r\nand, in his expression of deep personal feelings, we find a noble union\r\nof sad emotion and manliness of tone. He draws from a full treasury of\r\nvaried experience, active thought, close observation, just and original\r\nreflection, and a spirit which has drank deeply and lovingly from the\r\ngushing founts of nature. His inspiration is often kindled by the sunny\r\nand luxuriant scenery of the beautiful region to which he was born, and\r\nbesides the freshness and glow which this imparts to his descriptive\r\npoetry, it makes him emphatically the poet of the South. Not only has he\r\nsung her peculiar natural aspects with the appreciation of a poet and\r\nthe feeling of a son, but he has a claim to her gratitude for having\r\nenshrined in melodious verse her ancient and fading traditions.\r\n\r\nMr. Simms commenced writing verses at a very early period. At eight\r\nyears of age he rhymed the achievements of the American navy in the last\r\nwar with Great Britain. At fifteen, he was a scribbler of fugitive verse\r\nfor the newspapers, and before he was twenty-one he had published two\r\ncollections of miscellaneous poetry, which his better taste and prudence\r\nsubsequently induced him to suppress. Two other volumes of poems\r\nfollowed, in a more ambitious vein, which are also now beyond the reach\r\nof the collector, and were issued while he was engaged in the\r\noccupations of a newspaper editor and a student and practitioner of law.\r\nThese volumes were followed by Atalantis, a poem which has been highly\r\npraised by the best critics of our time.\r\n\r\nAs a prose writer, his vigorous, copious, and original ideas are clothed\r\nin a manly, flexible, pure, and lucid style. His first production,\r\nMartin Faber, succeeded Atalantis. It was the initial of a series of\r\ntales, which we may describe as of the metaphysical and passionate or\r\nmoral imaginative class. These, with two or more volumes of shorter\r\ntales, are numerous, and perhaps among the most original of his\r\nwritings. They comprise Martin Faber and other Tales, Castle Dismal,\r\nConfessions, or the Blind Heart, Carle Werner and other Tales, and the\r\nWigwam and Cabin. There are other compositions belonging to this\r\ncategory, and, it may be, not inferior in merit to any of these, which\r\nhave appeared in periodicals and annuals, but have not yet been\r\ncollected by their author.\r\n\r\nThe first novel of Mr. Simms belonged to our border and domestic\r\nhistory. This was Guy Rivers; and to the same class he has contributed\r\nlargely, in Richard Hurdis, Border Beagles, Beauchampe, Helen Halsey,\r\nand other productions. In historical romance, he has written The\r\nYemassee, the Damsel of Darien, Pelayo, and Count Julian, each in two\r\nvolumes. The scenes of the two last are laid in Europe. His romances\r\nfounded on our revolutionary history, are The Partisan, Mellichampe, and\r\nThe Kinsmen. In biography and history, he is the author of The Life of\r\nMarion; The Life of Captain John Smith, founder of Virginia; a History\r\nof South Carolina; a Geography of the same State; a Life of Bayard; and\r\na Life of General Greene.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to enumerate accurately his poetical productions, as\r\nmany, published in periodicals, have never been printed together; but\r\nthe collection of his poems now in course of publication at Charleston,\r\nwill supply a desideratum to the lovers of genuine American letters and\r\nart. Atalantis, Southern Passages and Pictures, Donna Florida, Grouped\r\nThoughts and Scattered Fancies, Areytos, Lays of the Palmetto, The\r\nCassique of Accube and other Poems, Norman Maurice, and The City of the\r\nSilent, constituting distinct volumes, are, however, well known.\r\n\r\nThe orations of Mr. Simms, which have been published, comprise one\r\ndelivered before the Erosophic Society of the Alabama University,\r\nentitled, The Social Principle--the true source of National Permanence;\r\nanother before the town council and citizens of Aiken, South Carolina,\r\non the Fourth of July, 1844, entitled, The Sources of American\r\nIndependence; and one delivered before literary societies in Georgia,\r\nentitled Self-development.\r\n\r\nAs a writer of criticism, Mr. Simms is known by numerous articles\r\ncontributed to periodicals; by a review of Mrs. Trolloppe, in the\r\nAmerican Quarterly, and of Miss Martineau in the Southern Literary\r\nMessenger (both subsequently republished in pamphlets, and received with\r\ngeneral approval), as well as by many others of equal merit--a selection\r\nfrom which, wholly devoted to American topics, has been published in two\r\nvolumes, under the title of Views and Reviews in American History and\r\nFiction.\r\n\r\nScarcely a production of Mr. Simms has been unmarked by a cordial\r\nreception from the best literary journals; and the praise of the London\r\n_Metropolitan_ and _Examiner_--the former when under the conduct of\r\nThomas Campbell, the latter of Albany Fonblanque--was generously\r\nbestowed, especially on _Atalantis_; of which the _Metropolitan_ said,\r\n\"What has the most disappointed us is, that it is so thoroughly English:\r\nthe construction, the imagery, and, with a very few exceptions, the\r\nidioms of the language, are altogether founded on our own scholastic and\r\nclassical models;\" and Fonblanque, in reviewing a tale by Simms,\r\nentitled, _Murder will Out_, said, \"But all we intended to say about the\r\noriginality displayed in the volume has been forgotten in the interest\r\nof the last story of the book, _Murder will Out_. This is an American\r\nghost story, and, without exception, the best we ever read. Within our\r\nlimits, we could not, with any justice, describe the whole course of its\r\nincident, and it is in that, perhaps, its most marvellous effect lies.\r\nIt is the _rationale_ of the whole matter of such appearances, given\r\nwith fine philosophy and masterly interest. We never read any thing more\r\nperfect or more consummately told.\"\r\n\r\nBut the testimony of the critical press, or even of the successful sale\r\nof an author's works, is not so suggestive of merit as the fact that his\r\nproductions have entered into the popular mind; and this tribute Mr.\r\nSimms has received in the fact that in regions which he has identified\r\nwith legends created for them by his own genius, localities of his\r\ndifferent incidents are pointed out with a sincere belief in their\r\nhistorical verity. The dramatic powers manifested in his novels, have\r\nbeen still more largely displayed in his _Norman Maurice_, a play of\r\nsingular originality, in design, character, and execution, the nervous\r\nlanguage and felicitous turns of expression in which remind us of the\r\nbest of the old dramatists. We have heretofore expressed in the\r\n_International_ a conviction that Norman Maurice is the best American\r\ndrama that has yet been published--the most American, the most dramatic,\r\nthe most original.\r\n\r\nAs a member of the Legislature of his native State, and on various\r\npublic occasions, Mr. Simms has vindicated a title to fame as an orator;\r\nand a recent nomination for the presidency of the South Carolina\r\nCollege, although he declined being a candidate, is an evidence of the\r\nimpression which his ability, information, and high character have\r\nproduced on his fellow citizens.\r\n\r\nHis intense intellectual activity, united with a habitually reflective\r\nand philosophical mode of thought, and unwearied laboriousness, enable\r\nhim to accomplish an almost incredible amount of literary labor. The\r\ncatalogue of his works which is subjoined, gives but an inadequate idea\r\nof what he has really performed; for multifarious productions, many of\r\nthem of the highest order in their respective classes, are scattered in\r\nthe pages of periodicals, or still in manuscript; while the unceasing\r\ndemands on his pen, with his arduous editorship, prevent him from\r\naccomplishing many fruitful designs, whose inception he has hinted in\r\nvarious ways. To his intellectual gifts, he unites a brave, generous\r\nnature, a kindly, and strong heart, a genial, impulsive, yet faithful\r\nand determined disposition, warm affection and friendship, a spirit to\r\ndo and to endure, and a soul as much elevated above the petty envies and\r\njealousies which too often deform the _genus irritabile_, as it is in\r\nlarge sympathy with the beautiful, the true, the just--with humanity and\r\nwith nature.

Astor, Stephen Whitney, the heirs of\r\nPeter Stuyvesant (of blessed memory), and others who own real estate in\r\nthis city, and likewise all mayors, common councilmen, and others in\r\nauthority, were endued with more taste, with a higher regard to the\r\ngeneral interest, and a juster sense of the matters that pertain to a\r\ngood administration, so that it might be said in after times that the\r\nbeneficence of the Creator (who in things natural has done more for ours\r\nthan for any other city), had been seconded by the pious wisdom of the\r\ncreature, and Manhattan pointed to as in all respects the metropolis of\r\nthe world. Why not? If the very stones in the streets of London, Paris,\r\nand Vienna, were turned to pure gold, they would not purchase for those\r\ncities advantages that should be compared with such as we already\r\npossessed by our beautiful island--a giant mosaic, set in emerald,\r\nstudding the bosom of Nature.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be said by our excellent neighbor, the minister of the\r\ndingy-looking red brick meeting-house round the corner, it is not less a\r\nwork of piety to create any work of beauty--a beautiful house, or shop,\r\nor poem, for example--than to teach a class in the Sunday school,--which\r\ndoctrine may be incidentally fortified from Jonathan Edwards's Theory of\r\nTrue Virtue, and more directly from the best philosophies of later\r\nyears. It is ordered that the dignity of human nature shall in a great\r\ndegree be dependent upon a sympathetic association with what is\r\nadmirable. It was Hazlitt, we believe,--certainly it was some one who\r\nappreciatingly recognized the highest earthly ministry,--who said it was\r\nimpossible to entertain an angry feeling in the presence of a lovely\r\nwoman's portrait,--which, done fitly, is the highest accomplishment of\r\nart. Whatever is beautiful or sublime has the same purifying and\r\nennobling tendency. The beggars do shrewdly who sit in _front_ of\r\nStewart's. The same person who would give a shilling there, would as\r\nlikely as not steal a penny from the hat of the blind man round the\r\ncorner, where those detestable red bricks so outrage every principle\r\nknown to a builder fit to handle the trowel. There is nothing more\r\noffensive than this custom of making of different materials the various\r\nfronts of the same edifice. It may be allowable to construct the _rear_\r\nof a house, or a side that is to be built against speedily, of a cheaper\r\nstone; but to make the face upon one street of marble, and the face\r\naround the corner of brick, as in the case of Stewart's store, and the\r\nSociety Library, is an outrage as ridiculous as it would be to make\r\nalternate gores of a woman's skirt of Petersham and Brussels lace.\r\nBricks are very respectable; we say nothing in their dispraise; but to\r\nany man of taste, an edifice is much more beautiful built entirely of\r\nbricks than it is with but one of two exposed parts of marble; and let\r\nus say to the affluent merchant to whom New-York is indebted for the\r\nstructure just mentioned, that until he paints his bricks on\r\nReade-street, so that they correspond as nearly as may be with his\r\nfronts on Chambers-street and Broadway, his store will indicate but a\r\nshabby gentility, an unnatural association of tow cloth and satin,\r\ncopper and silver, poverty and riches, which should blush in the face of\r\nthe most inferior exhibition of consistency. With the abolition of this\r\nstrong contrast, the observer who goes down Broadway will contemplate\r\nwith delight the classical air of this most imposing Palace of Trade\r\nthat has yet been erected in the cities of the United States. How easily\r\nBroadway, for the money that its piles of brick and stone will have cost\r\nin ten years, might be made the most splendid street in Christendom, by\r\na mere observance of the principles of taste and unity!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRINCIPAL HALL OF PETERSON & HUMPHREY'S CARPET HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nIn a little hamlet of five or fifteen hundred inhabitants, great\r\nbuildings are out of place. In a city like ours, every thing should be\r\nin keeping, and the predominant principle should be the _gigantesque_.\r\nIf the lot-holders from Bowling Green to the New Park would but consider\r\nthe matter, with intelligent reference not only to the glory of the city\r\nbut to their own profit; if each separate square were built as if it\r\nwere _one_ edifice (as, without any blending of property, it might be\r\nvery easily), though these squares were all of plain brick, and no more\r\ncostly than the well-known row of stores in William-street, what an\r\nimposing spectacle they would present! But if one block were like the\r\nAstor House, the next like Stewart's (except only the Reade street\r\nfront), the next a row of free-stone, the next one of brick, the next\r\none of granite,--here a Gothic, there a Byzantine, then a Corinthian,\r\nthen, if you please, as plain a front as that of the New-York\r\nHotel--with here and there a church, library, lyceum, or art gallery, of\r\na style less suitable for shops or dwellings,--and there would be\r\nnothing in the world to compare with Broadway. But this running of\r\ndemocracy into the ground, this whim of every vulgar fellow who owns a\r\nfront of twenty feet, that he must illustrate his independence by\r\nbuilding on it in his own peculiar way, is baulking Providence, and for\r\nthe full cost of magnificence confining us to tricksy meanness. Two or\r\nthree years ago rose the chaste and simple front of 349 Broadway, in a\r\nrow of decayed brick shops, which, it was hoped would give place to an\r\nentire range in imitation of the initial structure. But since then, the\r\nowner of a couple of adjoining lots--a Connecticut man probably--has\r\ncaused to be put up two stores of a different style, not of half the\r\nvalue of continuations of the less expensive edifice which they join. If\r\ninstead of this patchwork, now planted here for half a century, there\r\nhad been an extension of uniform stores from corner to corner--though\r\neither Beck's or the building we have mentioned had been the model--the\r\nsingle splendid edifice would have been a pride and boast of the city,\r\nand the separate stores would have been of much greater value than the\r\nbest can be now. It is as revolting (and much more vexatious, for its\r\npublicity) as the worst case of Saxon and Congo amalgamation. A\r\nmagnificent pile has been erected in Wall-street on the corner west of\r\nthe Exchange; but some person, ignorant, it is to be hoped for his\r\nsoul's sake, of the true obligations of morality applicable in the case,\r\nhas built, at the same time, at the same cost, of the same height, and\r\nwithout any conceivable justifying reason, an utterly incongruous basket\r\nof offices, as if for the special purpose of vexing the eyes of men who\r\nhave instincts of decency.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMPSON'S SALOON.]\r\n\r\nThe imposing edifice on the corner of Broadway and White-street, of\r\nwhich a view is presented on a preceding page, is one of the\r\nimprovements of the city made during the last year. In the great\r\ncarpet-house of Peterson & Humphrey are offered the productions of the\r\nbest looms in the world, in a variety and profusion probably unequalled\r\nelsewhere in America. The principal saloon is like a street, and it is\r\nalmost always thronged with people.\r\n\r\nNot far from the store of Peterson & Humphrey--at 359 Broadway--is the\r\nnew and beautiful building erected by the well-known confectioners,\r\nThompson & Son. This was opened to the public but a few weeks ago, and\r\nit is the most splendid establishment of the kind in America. The\r\nseveral sales during the last three quarters of a century of the ground\r\nupon which it is built, illustrate the rapid increase of value in real\r\nestate in this city during that period. The lot formed a part of the De\r\nPeyster farm, and was called pasture ground. On the death of Major De\r\nPeyster, the farm was divided, and this lot, then thirty-two feet wide,\r\nwas on the 13th of December, 1784, sold for L100 New-York currency; in\r\n1789 it was sold for L150; in 1805 for $1500; in 1820 for $4000; in 1825\r\nfor $11,000; and in 1850 it was bought by Mr. Thompson for $60,000, and\r\nhe has expended $50,000 in the erection of the building with which it is\r\nnow occupied, and which is twenty-eight feet wide, one hundred and\r\nninety feet deep, and sixty-two feet high. It is built in a very rich\r\nstyle, of Paterson stone, similar to that used in Trinity church. The\r\narchitects were Field and Correja, and the decorations in fresco are by\r\nRossini. Mr. Thompson, senior, has been a quarter of a century in the\r\nbusiness for which he has erected this new edifice, and in which he has\r\naccumulated his fortune. In 1820 there were but one or two houses of\r\nthe kind in New-York, and these were of limited capacity and in every\r\nway inferior to Taylor's, Weller's, or Thompson's, of the present day.\r\nThese are among the most luxurious and comfortable resorts for ladies\r\nand gentlemen who visit the city but for a part of a day, or who have\r\nnot time or inclination to go to houses in distant parts of the town, to\r\nlunch or dine, or for those who come down Broadway to do shopping, and\r\nneed a resting place, or enjoy an exchange for gossip.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRINCIPAL SALOON AT THOMPSON'S.]\r\n\r\nThe next of the Palaces of Trade recently erected in the city, for which\r\nwe have now room for any description, is the great silk house of the\r\nwell-known merchants, Bowen & McNamee, constituting one of the most\r\nattractive features of the lower part of Broadway. It is built of white\r\nmarble, and the style of architecture is Elizabethan, and peculiarly\r\nelaborate and effective. The building is thirty-seven and a half feet\r\nwide, one hundred and forty-seven deep, and four stories high; and each\r\nstory consists of a single unbroken hall, lined with the richest\r\nEnglish, German, French, Italian and Indian goods. The architect was Mr.\r\nJoseph C. Wells, and his plans were used in all the minutest details of\r\nornament and furniture. It is regarded, we believe, as the greatest\r\ntriumph of its kind of which our commercial metropolis has to boast;\r\nindeed in magnificence of design, beauty of execution, and perfect\r\nadaptation to its purposes, there is nothing superior to it, probably,\r\namong the buildings devoted to trade in all the world.\r\n\r\nIt was said by Jefferson that the genius of Architecture would never\r\nmake her abode in America; but the new edifices in New-York, of which we\r\nhave described some prominent specimens, may lead others to a different\r\nconclusion. And we are of opinion that the progress of this country, in\r\nthe last quarter of a century, has been less conspicuous in any thing\r\nelse than in this noble art, little as it is now understood, much as it\r\nis still disregarded. In some recent speculations on the subject, the\r\n_Tribune_ observes:\r\n\r\n\"There is no American architecture, unless the Lowell factories may be\r\nregarded as such. Our churches are small and imperfect imitations of a\r\nmiscellaneous Gothic, and our exchanges, colleges, lyceums, banks and\r\ncustom-houses affect the Greek, with as much propriety as our merchants,\r\nprofessors and clerks would indue themselves with the Athenian costume.\r\nThere is no hope of the churches and banks. They are nothing if not\r\nGothic and Grecian. We shall not discuss the probable character of our\r\narchitecture. It is clear that New-York will build brick houses, and in\r\nblocks. But beauty costs no more than ugliness, and although every man\r\nhas the right to build a house of that appearance which best pleases\r\nhimself, yet every citizen is bound to have at heart the beauty of the\r\ncity. He cannot escape it. His pride compels it; and therefore every man\r\nwho builds a house ought to consult, to some extent, the general effect\r\nof his building, and as he would not paint it blue or black, he should\r\nno less consider its form than its color.\r\n\r\n\"Cheapness and convenience will, of course, be the first principles in\r\nour building, beauty and picturesqueness will be secondary. The point is\r\nto combine these without much compromising either. At present our cities\r\nare the unhandsomest in the world. The street architecture is monotonous\r\nand heavy. The houses, compared with those of other capitals, are low,\r\nbut they are not light. Paris and the Italian cities have always a\r\nfestal air. Vienna is brilliant. Even grim old Rome seems waiting to be\r\ngay. You do not immediately see the reason of this. The houses are high,\r\nthe streets narrow, shutting out the sky, and the swarms of passengers\r\ndo not explain the charm. But if you look narrowly you will see that the\r\ndifference of effect produced, arises, not so much from any essential\r\narchitectural superiority; because the mass of building in any city is\r\nof about the same general character--but that it is due to the \"broken\r\nand various lines which every where meet the eye, relieving the heavy\r\ngravity of the smooth fronts which with us are entirely unrelieved.\r\nSometimes, indeed, a street is built with regard to its architectural\r\nbeauty, as the _Rue de Rivoli_, in Paris, of which the harmony is\r\nuniformity and not monotony. One side of this street is the garden of\r\nthe Tuileries, and the other is like a prolonged palace front. The\r\nnorthern side of the _Boulevards des Italiens_ is truly picturesque, but\r\nfor directly the contrary reason--the infinite variety of line\r\npresented.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOWEN & M'cNAMME'S SILK HOUSE.]\r\n\r\n\"It is to these lines of gallery and balcony which break and lighten the\r\nmass of building, that we must look for a hint of very feasible\r\nimprovement. If any city reader wishes an illustration of this fact, let\r\nhim observe how the iron verandah upon the Collamore House redeems the\r\notherwise bald, dead weight of that building. Then let him cast his eye\r\nup Broadway to the long front of Niblo's Hotel--unrelieved and\r\nblank--and consider the cheerful effect of a continuous gallery along\r\neach story, or separate balconies at every window, as on the beautiful\r\n_Chiaja_ at Naples. On the other hand let him ask his Metropolitan pride\r\nhow it would like a street of such edifices as the City Assembly Rooms\r\non the site of Tattersalls? So, also, in dwelling-houses, the balcony\r\nwhich is now confined to the parlor floor might occasionally be carried\r\nup through the other stories, and this, in narrow streets, with a\r\npeculiarly happy effect, as is seen in such streets of foreign cities,\r\nwhere the style, if elaborated in lattices and bay-windows, becomes\r\nromantic and poetic.\r\n\r\n\"Greater variety in the mouldings of doors and windows, and in the\r\ndesigns of porticoes, might easily be obtained, with an infinite gain of\r\ngrace to the city. The Broadway Theatre illustrates this, for it is\r\ncertainly one of the most impressive buildings upon that street. The\r\nquestion, it must be remembered, is not one of art, so much as of\r\npicturesqueness and effect. The galleries and balconies, &c., are only a\r\nsubterfuge. If an edifice is intrinsically beautiful and\r\nwell-proportioned, it claims no such accessories, as Stewart's building,\r\nwhich, although a simple square mass, yet from the admirable proportion,\r\nrather than the material, is as stately and imposing as many a foreign\r\npalace. But where there is no regard--as is the usual case--to the\r\ndignity or propriety of form, there we must take advantage of an\r\nalleviation, and obtain lightness, gayety, and variety as we best can.\r\n\r\n\"There is, however, one point peculiar to American, or more properly to\r\nNew-York building, which calls for the determined and constant censure\r\nof every man who values human life. We mean the flimsy style of building\r\narising from the frenzied haste with which we do every thing. This has\r\nlong been our reproach. Scarcely a year passes that we do not record\r\nsome disaster of this kind, often involving a melancholy waste of life.\r\n'_Is it strong?_' is a question constantly asked of a new building, and\r\na question which, in any civilized community, it should be as\r\nunnecessary to ask, as whether the public wells are poisoned.\r\n\r\n\"We know many who will not pass under buildings now going up or recently\r\nerected. A friend walked down Broadway one morning, while a building\r\nwas in course of erection on the site of the present Waverly House, and\r\nreturning in the afternoon found that it had all tumbled down. Our\r\nreaders have not forgotten the frightful fall of a block in Twenty-first\r\nstreet last spring. One is curious to know if nothing is ever to be\r\ndone--if the city means to take no security for the lives of the\r\ncitizens in this matter. It would be very easy to prevent this flimsy\r\nbuilding, and even were it very difficult it should be effectually done.\r\nThis, too, is a matter in which every citizen is interested.\r\n\r\n\"Stores and Warehouses have their own proprieties. Warehouses properly\r\navoid even the _appearance_ of lightness. They are devoted to heavy\r\nstorage. No life, save of bales and boxes,--and not of the contents of\r\nbales and boxes--is associated with them. Security is the first and only\r\nthing we demand of them, provided the structures are not painfully\r\ndisproportioned. So with Prisons. In fact, in architecture, the ornament\r\nmust depend upon the use, must be developed from the use. For the same\r\nreason that balconies become a dwelling-house they disfigure a\r\nwarehouse. Stores again should partake, in their appearance, of the\r\nintrinsic character and associations of shops. When shop-keeping becomes\r\nroyal, it should be royally housed, as in Stewart's building.\r\n\r\n\"The theme unravels itself endlessly. It is one of those common\r\ninterests of constantly recurring importance which it is always worth\r\nwhile to talk about. Because there is no American architecture, there is\r\nno occasion for making our buildings mere piles of brick and mortar,\r\npunctured here and there for light--and because we are a commonsense,\r\ngo-ahead people, there is no need that our houses should offend the eye;\r\nbut--for that reason--great need that they should please it.\r\n\r\n\"Lorenzo of Florence was the magnificent, not because he was rich, but\r\nbecause he knew the use of riches.\"\r\n\r\nDespite all drawbacks, our city is growing wonderfully in splendor as\r\nwell as in size; and perhaps no previous season has promised so many\r\nimprovements in Broadway, uptown, or by the different parks, as the\r\npresent. Surpassing already any metropolis in the world in the number\r\nand magnificence of our hotels, we are to have in occupancy within a few\r\nweeks the splendid St. Nicholas and the gigantic Metropolitan, besides\r\nhalf a dozen of inferior pretensions, which will yet surpass the best in\r\nother cities; and new churches, and galleries, and public halls, are\r\ntalked of, in number and capacity, as in beauty, sufficient for all the\r\npossible contingencies of a great capital, increasing in wealth, and\r\npower, and beauty, with such unexampled rapidity. The power and\r\nmagnificence of New-York have been built up by her merchants, whose\r\nprivate enterprise, public spirit, and intelligence and taste, are\r\nespecially conspicuous in the new edifices devoted to trade, of which we\r\nhave given descriptions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF BOWEN & M'cNAMEE'S SILK HOUSE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERMAN HOOKER, D.D.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nHerman Hooker is one of the most able and peculiar writers in religion\r\nand religious philosophy now living in America. Indeed, we are inclined\r\nto doubt whether the Episcopal Church in the United States embraces\r\nanother author whose name will be as long or as respectfully remembered\r\nin the Christian world. If he is not mentioned in \"every day's report,\"\r\nit is because he adds to genius an unobtrusive modesty, as rare as are\r\nthe admirable qualities with which in his case it is associated.\r\n\r\nDr. Hooker is a native of Poultney, Rutland county, Vermont. He was\r\ngraduated at Middlebury College in 1825, and soon after entered upon the\r\nstudy of divinity at the Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Princeton.\r\nHe subsequently took orders in the Episcopal Church, and acquired\r\nconsiderable reputation as a preacher; but at the end of a few years ill\r\nhealth compelled him to abandon the pulpit, and he has since resided in\r\nPhiladelphia. The distinction of Doctor in Divinity was conferred upon\r\nhim three or four years ago by Union College.\r\n\r\nDr. Hooker published in 1835 _The Portion of the Soul, or Thoughts on\r\nits Attributes and Tendencies as Indications of its Destiny_; in the\r\nsame year _Popular Infidelity_, which in later editions is entitled,\r\n_The Philosophy of Unbelief, in Morals and Religion, as discernible in\r\nthe Faith and Character of Men_; in 1846, _The Uses of Adversity and the\r\nProvisions of Consolation_; in 1848, _The Christian Life a Fight of\r\nFaith_; and soon after, _Thoughts and Maxims_, a book worthy of\r\nRochefoucauld for point, of Herbert for piety, and Bacon for wisdom.\r\n\r\nUpon meeting with qualities like Dr. Hooker's in one not known among the\r\npopular authors of the country, we are prompted to say with Wordsworth,\r\n\"Strongest minds are often those of whom the world hears least,\" or in\r\nthe bolder words of Henry Taylor, \"The world knows nothing of its\r\ngreatest men.\" It is surprising that a voice like his should have\r\nawakened no echoes. He deserves a place among the first religious\r\nwriters of the age: for he has been faithful to the great mission laid\r\nupon the priesthood, which is, not to labor upon \"forms, modes, shows,\"\r\nof devotion, nor to dispute of systems, schools, and theories of faith,\r\nbut to be witnesses of a law above the world, and prophets of a\r\nconsolation that is not of mortality. When we take up one of his books,\r\nwe could imagine that we had fallen upon one of those great masters in\r\ndivinity, who in the seventeenth century illustrated the field of moral\r\nrelations and affections with a power and splendor peculiar to that age.\r\nThese great writers possessed an apprehension of spiritual subjects,\r\nsensitive, yet profoundly rational; a vision on which the rays of a\r\nhigher consciousness streamed in lustre so transcending that the light\r\nof earth seemed like a shadow thrown across its course; which differed\r\nfrom inspiration in degree rather than in kind. The resemblance of Dr.\r\nHooker to these great authors is obviously not an affectation. It is not\r\nconfined to style, but reaches to the constitution and tone of the mind.\r\nHis productions indicate the same temper of deep thoughtfulness upon\r\nman's estate and destiny; the same union of a personal sympathy with a\r\njudicial superiority, which suffers in all the human weaknesses which it\r\ndetects and condemns; the same earnest sense of their subjects as\r\nrealities, clear, present and palpable; the same quick feeling, toned\r\ninto dignity by pervading, essential wisdom; and that direct cognizance\r\nof the substances of religion, which does not deduce its great moral\r\ntruths as consequences of an assumed theory, but seizes them as primary\r\nelements that verify themselves and draw the theories after them by a\r\nnatural connection. Fretted and wearied with metaphysical theologies;\r\nvexed by the self-illustration, the want of candor, the fierceness, the\r\nungenial and unsatisfying hollowness of popular religionism, we turn\r\nwith a grateful relief to this soothing and impressive system which\r\nspeculates not, wrangles not, reviles not, but, while it every where\r\ntestifies of the degradation we are under, touches our spirits to power\r\nand purity by the constant exhortation of \"sursem corda!\"\r\n\r\nThe style of Dr. Hooker abounds in spontaneous interest and unexpected\r\ngraces. It seems to result immediately from his character, and to be an\r\ninseparable part of it. It is free from all the commonplaces of fine\r\nwriting; has nothing of the formal contrivance of the rhetorician, the\r\nbalanced period, the pointed turn, the recurring cadence. Yet the charms\r\nof a genuine simplicity, of a directness almost quaint, of primitive\r\ngravity, and calm, native good sense, renders it singularly agreeable to\r\na cultivated taste. Undoubtedly there is in spiritual sensibility\r\nsomething akin to genius, and like it tending to utterance in language\r\nsignificant and beautiful. We meet at times in Dr. Hooker's writings\r\nwith phrases of the rarest felicity and of great delicacy and\r\nexpressiveness; in which we know not whether most to admire the vigor\r\nwhich has conceived so striking a thought, or the refinement of art\r\nwhich has fixed it in words so beautifully exact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNSET.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nBY R.

HENRY COPE has lately published in London a _Ride across the\r\nRocky Mountains, to California_--a book abounding in striking adventure\r\nand description, and illustrating in its general tone the spirit of an\r\nEnglish gentleman. Its temper and good sense may be inferred from the\r\nfollowing specimen, on the never-failing subject of Society in New-York:\r\n\r\n     \"Any observations I might be tempted to make on New-York, or\r\n     even, I am inclined to think, on any of the civilized parts\r\n     of the states, would probably be neither novel nor\r\n     interesting. I am not ambitious of circulating more\r\n     'American notes,' nor do I care to follow in the footsteps\r\n     of Mrs. Trollope. Enough has been written to illustrate the\r\n     singularities of second-rate American society. Good society\r\n     is the same all over the world. General remarks I hold to be\r\n     fair play. But to indulge in personalities is a poor return\r\n     for hospitality; and those Americans who are most willing to\r\n     be civil to foreigners, receive little enough encouragement\r\n     to extend that civility, when, as is too often the case,\r\n     those very foreigners afterwards attempt to amuse their\r\n     friends on one side of the Atlantic, at the expense of a\r\n     breach of good faith to their friends on the other. Every\r\n     one has his prejudices: I freely confess I have mine. I like\r\n     London better than New-York, but it does not, therefore,\r\n     follow that I dislike New-York, or Americans either. I have\r\n     a great respect for almost every thing American--I do not\r\n     mean to say that I have any affection for a thorough bred\r\n     Yankee, in our acceptation of the term; far from it, I think\r\n     him the most offensive of all bipeds in the known world.\r\n     Yankee snobs too I hate--such as infest Broadway, for\r\n     instance, genuine specimens of the genus, according to the\r\n     highest authorities. The worst of New-York is its\r\n     superabundance of snobbism. The snob here is a snob \"_sui\r\n     generis_\" quite beyond the capacities of the old world.\r\n     There is no mistaking him. He is cut out after the most\r\n     approved pattern. If he differs from the original, or\r\n     whatever that might have been, it must be in a surpassing\r\n     excellence of snobbism which does credit to the progressive\r\n     order of things. Tuft-hunting is a sport he pursues with\r\n     delight to himself, but without remorse or pity for his\r\n     victim. It is necessary for the object of his persecutions\r\n     to be constantly on the alert. He is frequently seen\r\n     prowling about in white kid gloves, patent leather boots,\r\n     and Parisian hat. Whenever this is the case, he must be\r\n     considered dangerous and bloody-minded, for in all\r\n     probability he is meditating a call. Often he has been known\r\n     to run his prey to ground in the Opera or other public\r\n     places, and there to worry them within less than an inch of\r\n     their good temper. Offensive as he is, generally speaking,\r\n     he sometimes acts on the defensive; for, not very well\r\n     convinced of his own infallibility, he is particularly\r\n     susceptible of affronts, to which his assumed consequence\r\n     not unfrequently makes him liable. Baits are often proffered\r\n     by these swell-catchers to lure the unwary. Such as an\r\n     introduction to the nymphs of the _corps de ballet_; the\r\n     _entre_ to all the theatres, private gambling-houses, &c.,\r\n     &c. But beware of such seductions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMILIE DE COIGNY.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nBY RICHARD B. KIMBALL.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EMILIE DE COIGNY AND THE STUDENTS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nA morning at _La Morgue_ is hardly as agreeable as a day at the Louvre,\r\nyet it is not without a certain fascination. Let but the influence once\r\nfasten on you, and it will be very hard to shake it off. At one period I\r\nconfess it was to me almost irresistible, and I shudder sometimes when I\r\nrecollect how punctually every morning at the same hour I took my place\r\non one side of that fearful room--not for the purpose of inspecting the\r\nbodies of the suicides (I rarely turned to look at them), but to regard\r\nthe countenances of the anxious ones who came to realize the worst, or\r\nto take hope till the morrow. Literally there are no spectators in that\r\ndismal solitude--if we except an occasional visit from the foreign\r\nsight-hunter, who comes in charge of a valet, and passes in and out and\r\naway to the \"next place.\" In London or in New-York, an establishment so\r\npublic would be thronged with persons eager to gratify a prurient\r\ncuriosity. Not so in Paris. The French possess a sensibility so\r\nrefined--it may be called a species of delicacy--that they cannot enjoy\r\nsuch a spectacle, can scarcely endure it: and if the tourist will bring\r\nthe subject to mind, he will recollect that while his guide pointed out\r\nthe entrance, he himself declined going into the apartment.\r\n\r\nI know not how it happened, but, as I have remarked, the habit of\r\nvisiting this spot every morning, was fastened on me. Never shall I\r\nforget some of the faces I encountered there. One image is impressed on\r\nme indelibly; it is that of a woman of middle age, with a very pale\r\nface, and having the appearance of one struggling with some wearing\r\nsorrow, who for two weeks in succession came in daily, and walking\r\npainfully up to the partition, looked intently through the lattice work,\r\nand turned and went away. I never before felt so strong an impulse to\r\naccost a person, without yielding to it. Indeed I had resolved to speak\r\nto her on the morning of the fifteenth day, but she did not come and I\r\nnever saw her again. Who was she? did her fears prove groundless? what\r\nbecame of her? An old man I remember to have seen--a very old man,\r\nfeeble and decrepit, who came once only, looked at the dead, shook his\r\nhead despairingly, and tottered away: I know not if he discovered the\r\nobject of his search. Young girls who had quarrelled with their lovers,\r\nand lovers who in moments of jealousy had been cruel to their\r\nsweethearts, would look anxiously in, and generally with relieved\r\nspirits pass out, almost smilingly, resolving no doubt to make all up\r\nbefore night should again tempt to suicide. Another incident I cannot\r\nomit, although it is impossible to recall it without a dreadful pang.\r\nOne morning a pretty fair-haired child, not more than four years old,\r\ncame running in, and clasping the wooden bar with one hand, pointed with\r\nher little finger through the opening, and with a tone of innocent\r\ncuriosity said, \"There's mamma!\" The same moment two or three rushed in,\r\nand seizing the unconscious orphan, carried her hastily away. She had\r\nwandered after some of the family, and heard enough as they came from\r\nthe fatal place to lead her to suppose her lost mamma was there, and so\r\nshe ran to see. What could be the circumstances so untoward, that even\r\nthe child could not bind the mother to life?\r\n\r\nA long chapter might be written of the occurrences at my singular\r\nrendezvous, but I had no design, when I began, of alluding to them, and\r\nI will only remark here that, leaving Paris some time after for the\r\nsouth of Europe, I got rid of this nightmare impulse, and although I\r\nreturned the following season I never again entered _La Morgue_....\r\n\r\nIt was in the spring when I came back. The foliage was deep and green,\r\nand in the _Jardin des Plants_, which was near my quarters, the various\r\nflowers and shrubs and trees filled the atmosphere with fragrance, and\r\ntempted us to frequent strolls along its avenues.\r\n\r\n\"Come with me at six o'clock,\" said my friend Partridge, \"and you shall\r\nsee an apparition.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not tell you, till we are on the Spot.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will go, but hope the rendezvous will be an agreeable one.\" Just\r\nthen, I know not why, I thought of _La Morgue_, and shuddered.\r\n\r\n\"The most agreeable in all Paris.\"\r\n\r\nThis conversation took place in the Hospital _de Notre Dame de Pitie_,\r\njust as we were finishing our morning occupation of following the\r\ncelebrated LOUIS through the fever wards. Partridge was my room-mate,\r\nand generally a fellow traveller, but I had left him behind in my late\r\ntour, to devote himself more entirely to his medical pursuits, while I,\r\nto my shame be it spoken, began to tire of the lectures of Broussais,\r\nand the teachings of Majendie; and, even now that I had returned, was\r\ntempted every day to slip across to the _Rue Vivienne_, where were\r\nstaying some fascinating strangers, whose acquaintance I had made _en\r\nroute_, and who had begun to engross me too much for any steady progress\r\nin my studies; at least so thought Partridge, who shook his head and\r\nsaid it would not do for a student to cross the Seine--he ought to stay\r\nin his own _quartier_; that I had had too much recreation as it was--I\r\nshould forget the little I know, and as for the _Rue Vivienne_, and the\r\n_Boulevard des Italiens_, the _Rue de la Paix_, &c., I must break off\r\nall such associations or be read out of the community. I was glad,\r\ntherefore, to appease my friend by consenting to go with him--I knew not\r\nwhere--and see an apparition.\r\n\r\nAccordingly a few minutes before six, we started together on the strange\r\nadventure. We passed down the street which leads to the _Jardin des\r\nPlants_, and entering through the main avenue, walked nearly its entire\r\nlength, when my companion turned into a narrow path, almost concealed by\r\nthe foliage, which brought us into a small open space. Here he motioned\r\nme to stop, and pointing to a rustic bench we both sat down. At the same\r\nmoment, the chimes from a neighboring chapel pealed the hour of six, and\r\nwhile I was still listening to them, my friend seized my arm and\r\nexclaimed in a whisper, \"Look!\" I cast my eyes across to the other side,\r\nand beheld a figure advancing slowly toward us. It was that of a young\r\ngirl, in appearance scarcely seventeen. Her form was light and graceful,\r\nsimply draped in a loose robe of white muslin. On her head she wore a\r\nstraw hat, in which were placed conspicuously a bunch of fresh spring\r\nblossoms. The gloves and mantelet seemed to have been forgotten. Her\r\ndemeanor was one of gentleness and modesty. She cast her eyes around as\r\nif expecting to meet a companion, and then quietly sat down on a rude\r\nseat not very far from where we were. I remained for ten minutes\r\npatiently waiting a demonstration of some kind, either from my companion\r\nor the strange appearance near us. But now I began to yield to the\r\ninfluence of the scene. The sun was declining, and cast a mellow and\r\nsaddening light over the various objects around. Gradually as I gazed on\r\nthe motionless form of the maiden, I felt impressed with awe, which was\r\nheightened by the solemn manner of my friend, who appeared as much under\r\nthe charm as myself. At length I whispered to him, \"For Heaven's sake\r\ntell me what does all this mean?\" A low \"Hush,\" with an expressive\r\ngesture to enforce quiet, was the only response. I made no further\r\nattempt to interrupt the silence, but sat spell-bound, always looking at\r\nthe figure, until I was positively afraid to take my eyes from it. Again\r\nthe chimes began their peal for the completion of the last quarter. It\r\nwas seven o'clock. The moment they ceased, the girl rose from her seat,\r\nglanced slowly, sadly, earnestly around, pressed her hand across her\r\neyes, and proceeded in the path toward us. We both stood up as she came\r\nnear; my friend lifted his hat from his head in the most respectful\r\nmanner as the maiden passed, while she in return gazed vacantly on him,\r\nand walking slowly by, disappeared in the direction opposite that from\r\nwhich she came. We did not remain, but proceeded with a quickened pace\r\nto our lodgings. Arrived there, I asked for an explanation of what we\r\nhad witnessed.\r\n\r\n\"Do you remember,\" said Partridge, \"Alfred Dervilly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly well. He was your room-mate after I left you last summer, and\r\ntwenty times I have been on the point of inquiring for him, but\r\nsomething at each moment prevented. Where is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dead! How, when?\"\r\n\r\n\"Killed by the apparition yonder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! Do not talk any more in riddles. Out with what you have to\r\nsay about Dervilly and the apparition, as you call it, and this\r\nafternoon's adventure.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Bien_, let us light the candles, fasten the doors, close the windows,\r\nand take a fresh cigar.\"\r\n\r\nThis was soon done, and accommodating himself to his seat in a\r\ncomfortable manner, my companion commenced:\r\n\r\n\"Yes--you recollect Dervilly of course, and must remember that before\r\nyou left us we used to joke him about a fair unknown, who was engaging\r\nso much of his time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had forgotten--but I now recall the circumstance; I remember, I was\r\nwalking with him near the 'Garden,' and he made some trivial excuse to\r\nleave me and turn into it. You afterwards told me he had an appointment\r\nthere, but I thought little of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I will give you the story as I now have it, quite complete, for I\r\nwas partly in Dervilly's confidence, and was with him during his illness\r\nand when he died. He was born in Louisiana, of French parents, who,\r\nafter spending some years in America, returned to their native country.\r\nHe spoke English fluently, as you know, and when you deserted me we\r\nbecame very intimate. Then it was I learned how deeply the poor fellow\r\nwas in love, actually _in love_. No mere transitory emotion--no\r\nmomentary passion for an adventure--no affair of gallantry, was this:\r\nhis very being was absorbed--he became wholly changed--it seemed as if\r\nhe had bound himself, body and soul, to some spirit of another world. I\r\nnever saw, never read, of so engrossing a feeling. At last he confessed\r\nto me. He said he had met, a few months before, at the house of a former\r\nfriend of his family, who had been of considerable consequence under the\r\nprevious reign, but was now reduced, and lived in obscurity, a creature\r\nof most exquisite shape and feature, who proved on acquaintance to be\r\npossessed with a loveliness of character, a modesty, an irresistible\r\ncharm of manner, which took him captive. Dervilly became completely\r\nenamored with Emilie de Coigny. This he discovered to be her name, but\r\non inquiring of the persons at whose house he first met her, he could\r\nget no satisfactory information; indeed a very singular reserve, as poor\r\nDervilly thought, was maintained whenever her name was mentioned, so\r\nthat he could not, in fact, glean the slightest particulars about her.\r\nThis did not prevent him from confessing his passion, for the girl came\r\nfrequently to this house, and their acquaintance ripened very fast.\r\nEmilie de Coigny felt for the first time that her heart was occupied,\r\nand all that restlessness of spirit caused by the unconscious longing of\r\nthe affections laid at rest, and Alfred Dervilly became the sole object\r\nof her thoughts and of her hopes, if hopes she had. All this, I repeat,\r\nEmilie de Coigny felt; but, singular to say, she hesitated to confess\r\nwhat was in her heart, even when her lover passionately entreated; it\r\nseemed as if something stood between her and happiness, to which she\r\nfeared to allude. It is not easy to deceive the _heart_, and Dervilly\r\nknew, despite the apparent calmness of Emilie, despite her sometimes\r\ncold demeanor, that he was loved in return. But one thing troubled and\r\nperplexed him; one thing filled him with vague fears and apprehensions,\r\nand checked the ecstatic feelings which were ready to overflow his\r\nheart. A mystery hung about this beautiful girl; she claimed no one for\r\nher friend, she spoke of no acquaintances, she never alluded to parents,\r\nor to brother or sister, or other relation; she made no mention of her\r\nhome. Besides, a strange sadness, strange in one so young, seemed to\r\npossess her, and to pervade her spirit, and while contemplating that\r\nimperturbable countenance, Dervilly at times felt an awe come over him\r\nfor which he could not account, and which for moments subdued even the\r\nforce of his passion. It appeared to him then, as if he were under a\r\nspell; but presently, when a gentle smile illumined her face, her eyes\r\nwould be turned on him so lovingly, and her look express, as plainly as\r\nlook could, that all her trust was in him and in him only. Dervilly\r\nwould forget every thing in the raptures of such moments; indeed in his\r\necstasy he would be driven almost to madness; for of all characters,\"\r\ncontinued Partridge, \"hers was the one to set a youth of ardent\r\ntemperament absolutely crazy. So matters advanced, or rather I should\r\nsay, so time advanced, while affairs did not. It was at this period,\"\r\nsaid my friend, \"that Dervilly gave me his confidence. Our intimacy had\r\ngradually increased from the hour of your leaving us, and at length he\r\nunbosomed himself completely. My first impression, after hearing his\r\nstory, was that the pretty mademoiselle was no more nor less than an\r\narrant flirt; that her charms were magnified to a lover's vision, and\r\nthat the mystery which attended her would turn out to be no mystery at\r\nall--so I treated the case lightly, laughed at his description, called\r\nMademoiselle Emilie a coquette, and added, a little seriously, that it\r\nwas a shame for her to trifle with so warm-hearted a fellow. You know\r\nhow grating are the disparaging remarks of a friend about one in whom we\r\nconfess to ourselves a deeper interest than we care to acknowledge. What\r\nI had said was kindly intended, but it touched Dervilly to the quick. 'I\r\ndid not think you capable,' he exclaimed, 'of thus making light of my\r\nconfidence--I find I was deceived--you are at liberty to make as much\r\nsport of me as you will. I have learned a lesson which I shall take care\r\nto remember.' 'You must not speak so,' I said,' I really was not\r\nserious. I take back every word. I would not wound you for the\r\nworld--forgive me.' Then we shook hands, and Dervilly assured me I had\r\nmisjudged his Emilie; he would ask her permission to introduce me, and I\r\nshould see for myself. The permission was never accorded, although\r\nDervilly urged to Mademoiselle de Coigny, that I was his best and almost\r\nhis only friend. She was unyielding; she would not see me. Meanwhile his\r\npassion increased with every impediment--yet he gained no assurance of\r\nits being returned, save what his heart whispered to him. In the\r\n_Jardin des Plants_ they were accustomed to meet daily, when the weather\r\nwas propitious--so much Emilie yielded to her lover--and spend an hour\r\ntogether; and if they could not meet in the open air, they repaired to\r\nthe house where they first became acquainted. On one occasion Dervilly,\r\nunable to bear suspense any longer, seized her hand, and passionately\r\npledged himself, his existence, his soul, his all to Emilie de Coigny;\r\nhe swore his fate was indissolubly linked with hers, that their destiny\r\ncould not be severed, and he demanded from her an avowal of the truth of\r\nwhat he said. The violence of Dervilly alarmed her; she drew her hand\r\nfrom his, and looking him steadily in the face, inquired:\r\n\r\n\"'What has prompted Monsieur to this sudden show of feeling?'\r\n\r\n\"'Do you ask what?' exclaimed Dervilly; 'it is _you_. Are you not\r\nanswered? How can I resist what is inevitable? how curb myself when\r\n_all_ hold is lost? Are you then so cruel? _Dieu merci!_ be not so\r\ndeadly calm--it means the worst for me--be angry, vexed, any thing, but\r\nlook not on me with that glazed look--it maddens me.'\r\n\r\n\"'Monsieur Dervilly,' said Emilie, without change of tone or manner,\r\n'what you have said, if it means any thing, means every thing; it means\r\nall a maiden longs to hear from lips that are beloved. To respond, I\r\nmust be assured how far your judgment will confirm what now seems to be\r\na mere passionate ebullition. Excuse me,' she continued, as Dervilly\r\nmade an impatient gesture; 'I have heard and read of similar\r\nprotestations which had little true significance.'\r\n\r\n\"'I accept any conditions,' interrupted the young man, 'and will bless\r\nyou from the depths of my soul for naming any, even the hardest; yes,\r\nthe hardest--I care not what, so that they are from you.' The girl\r\nregarded Dervilly as if she would search his very nature. 'You are\r\nsilent--speak; I can no longer contain myself,' exclaimed he, wildly.\r\n\r\n\"'Monsieur,' once more observed Mademoiselle de Coigny, 'you know not to\r\nwhom you address yourself; should I tell you, you would retract all\r\nthose strong words, and hasten to escape in the least humiliating way\r\npossible.'\r\n\r\n\"'Never. Heaven is my witness, never! I care not who you are; I will\r\nnever seek to know; when you choose, you shall inform me. You need never\r\ntell me. I say, I care not, so that you are mine.'\r\n\r\n\"'And you will be _mine_ for ever?' said the girl, slowly.\r\n\r\n\"'For ever.'\r\n\r\n\"'I am yours--yours,' and Emilie de Coigny sunk into the arms of her\r\nlover.\r\n\r\n\"In one instant the fortunes of Dervilly were changed--from despair he\r\nwas raised to a condition of delicious joy. His raptures were so\r\nunnatural, that I cautioned him against such violent indulgence of them.\r\nBut he was too excited to listen to me. Indeed, I feared he would lose\r\nhis reason. It seemed as if more than ordinary passion had possession of\r\nhim, and that it was inspired by something unearthly; and, without ever\r\nhaving seen the girl, I began to attribute to her a supernatural\r\ninfluence. Besides, Dervilly confessed he knew as little of his\r\naffianced as before, and that occasionally the same icy look would be\r\nturned on him, as it were quite inadvertently, and hold him spell-bound\r\nwith horror, while it still served to increase his frenzy beyond all\r\nbounds. Then, her endearing smiles, her truthful and confiding love, her\r\nabsolute reliance, her entire dependence, on Dervilly, made him so\r\nfrantic with happiness, that he lost all capacity to reason.\r\n\r\n\"The summer passed away, but Dervilly had learned nothing more of the\r\nhistory of his betrothed; she still avoided the subject, and, when he\r\nalluded to it, she would beg him to desist, and hide her face in his\r\nbosom and weep.\r\n\r\n\"Strange thoughts at last found their way into his brain, fearful\r\nsurmises began to disturb his peace, and, when absent from Emilie, he\r\nwould resolve at their next interview, to insist on knowing all. But\r\nwhen the time came, and he met, turned on him, the open and innocent\r\nlook of the maiden's clear eyes, which expressed so earnestly how\r\nentirely her soul rested on his, all courage failed him, and he could\r\nnot go on.....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"One evening,\" continued Partridge, after a pause, and with the tone of\r\na person approaching an unpleasant subject, \"One evening, after\r\ndinner--I think it was the first week in September--when the day had\r\nbeen excessively sultry, I strolled into the large garden, which you\r\nrecollect belonged to our old lodgings in the _Rue d' Enfer_ and after a\r\nwhile sat down in the summer-house. Presently little Sophie Lecomte came\r\nrunning out to me, and I remained amusing myself with the child's\r\nprattle till it was dark. The moon shone brightly, and I did not\r\nperceive how late it was, until reminded of the hour by finding that\r\nSophie was fast asleep in my lap. I rose and carried her into the house,\r\nand went quietly to my room. I seated myself near the window without\r\nlighting the candles, feeling that the glare would not just then\r\nharmonize with my feelings. The truth is, I was thinking of you, and of\r\nthat romantic passage across the Apennines, and of the fair stranger,\r\nand so forth. I sat by the window, the moonlight streaming across the\r\nroom, over the top of the old chapel, the windows and doors open, and\r\nevery thing still except the monotonous chirping of a single cricket,\r\nlouder than that of any French cricket I ever heard before, and which\r\nsung the very same song I used to hear when a boy from under the large\r\nkitchen hearthstone at home. I began to feel a little lonely, and so\r\nstarted up, and stamped with my feet in order to silence the solitary\r\ninsect, or arouse the rest of the family, but the old one only sung the\r\nharder, and the others would not wake, and I sat down again, and half\r\nclosed my eyes in order to lose myself, if I could, in some pleasant\r\nrevery. My eyes _were_ half closed, the perfume from the graperies\r\nfilled the room, and had a pleasant effect upon my senses, and thus I\r\nbegan to forget where I was and what was about me. Presently I heard a\r\nrapid unsteady step along the corridor; it grew more rapid and more\r\nunsteady; I raised my head, and at that instant Dervilly hurried into\r\nthe room. 'I knew it--I knew it,' he exclaimed, wildly; 'one of the\r\nsirens sent from hell! I have sold myself, body and soul!--I am\r\nlost--lost. Ah! I knew it--I knew it.' Shocked and surprised as I was by\r\nsuch an extraordinary scene, I did not forget that Dervilly was of a\r\nmost nervous and excitable temperament. I rose, took hold of him kindly,\r\nand asked him what had happened. As I placed my hand on his head, I\r\nperceived that the veins were distended, and that the carotid and\r\ntemporal arteries were throbbing violently. I hastened to strike a\r\nlight, while he continued to repeat nearly the words I have just\r\nmentioned, in a wild and incoherent manner. I could now see his\r\ncountenance, and it seemed as if the destroyer had been ravaging it. His\r\ncap was gone. His hair, which was usually so neatly arranged, was tossed\r\nover his face in twisted locks; his eyes were fixed, and bloodshot, and\r\nsparkling.\r\n\r\n\"'My dear friend, you are ill--you are excited--let me bring you to your\r\nbed' (we occupied the large room in common, with a small bedroom for\r\neach, leading from it); with this I took his arm, and gently urged him\r\nto his apartment.\r\n\r\n\"'Not there, not there!' he cried vehemently; 'Have I not lain _there_,\r\nnight after night, thinking of her?--have I not dreamed there happy\r\ndreams, and seen dear delightful visions? Not there--never--never\r\nagain!'\r\n\r\n\"'You shall not,' I said, endeavoring to humor him; 'you shall lie in my\r\nbed, and I will watch by you till you are better.'\r\n\r\n\"The young man burst into tears. This action evidently relieved him, and\r\nmade him more rational, for he took my arm and I assisted him to bed,\r\nand tried to soothe him; but he soon relapsed into an excited fever.\r\nShortly after, he called me to him, and throwing his arms closely around\r\nme, exclaimed, 'Partridge, we were born in the same land; I implore you,\r\nby that one common tie, not to leave me an instant; I am a doomed\r\nwretch; but save me, save me from the fiend, as long as it is possible.'\r\n\r\n\"I now became very much alarmed. My first impulse was to administer an\r\nopiate; but the case seemed so critical that I determined to send at\r\nonce for Louis, whose sympathy for the students, you know, is universal.\r\nI called to young Stabb, who occupied the next room, and he set off\r\nimmediately. After a few minutes Dervilly dozed a little; and then he\r\nstarted up, and gazed around, as if attempting to discern some object.\r\n\r\n\"'Do you wish for any thing?' I said. He took no notice of my question,\r\nbut continued to glance piercingly in every direction.\r\n\r\n\"'What do you see?' I asked.\r\n\r\n\"'_La Morgue!_' he exclaimed, with a shudder, and pointing into the\r\nother room--'_La Morgue!_'\r\n\r\n\"He continued to gaze madly in the same way, still holding his arm\r\noutstretched, while his whole frame seemed convulsed with terror; but I\r\ncould gain no clue to the catastrophe which had fallen so terribly on\r\nthe ill-fated sufferer.\r\n\r\n\"It seemed to me an age--it really was but an hour--before Stabb\r\nreturned. He was accompanied by Louis. It was the great Louis whose\r\nskill as a physician, and especially in the treatment of fevers, is\r\nworld renowned. I had 'followed' him during the whole of your absence;\r\nhad become, as a matter of course, one of his warmest admirers; and was\r\nfortunate enough to secure his friendship. He also knew Dervilly.\r\nHearing them enter, I stepped into the principal room, to meet him.\r\n'_Mon Dieu! Monsieur Partridge, quel est le mal?_' said Louis, with\r\ngreat feeling. 'Monsieur Dervilly was at the hospital in the morning,\r\nand I met him as late as six o'clock this afternoon, passing into the\r\n_Jardin des Plants_.'\r\n\r\n\"'God only knows,' I replied. 'Something horrible has suddenly befallen\r\nhim.' And I gave an account of what had occurred since Dervilly came to\r\nhis rooms. Louis was silent for a moment, and then began to question me\r\nvery minutely about him, while Stabb went in to keep watch over the poor\r\nfellow.--Among other things, I mentioned his love affair; and believing\r\nit to be my duty to do so, I told Louis, briefly, all Dervilly had\r\nconfided to me. He listened with great attention, and after I had\r\nconcluded, we passed into the little chamber where Dervilly lay. He\r\nstarted up with violence as we came in, as if a severe paroxysm were\r\nabout to follow. He stared wildly on seeing Louis, and seizing his hand,\r\nhe exclaimed, 'Ah, _mon Professeur_, you are a very great man, and you\r\nare very kind to come to me, but your knowledge avails nothing here,'\r\ntouching his forehead. Suddenly he extended his finger, and cried again,\r\n'_La Morgue--La Morgue._'\r\n\r\n\"'What see you in _La Morgue_?' said Louis, tenderly.\r\n\r\n\"'See? _Her, her!_' screamed Dervilly.\r\n\r\n\"'Who, _mon enfant_? said the Professor, very gently.\r\n\r\n\"'Who, but the fiend--the fiend! She has my soul--lost, lost for ever.'\r\n\r\n\"'You should not speak so harshly of Mademoiselle de Coigny,' continued\r\nLouis, in a soothing tone.\r\n\r\n\"'Pronounce not that name: a bait, a trap, a wile of Satan; repeat it,\r\nand I will tear you piecemeal!' cried the maniac.\r\n\r\n\"'But, _mon pauvre enfant_, what does she at La Morgue?'\r\n\r\n\"'_She?_ the fiend--the fiend--sits perched on the top of the wooden\r\nrail all night, watching--watching--and when some of the corpses show\r\nsigns of life, sails down, and sits upon, and strangles them. Keep me\r\naway from there. Ah, _mon Professeur_, do not let me go there, to lie on\r\nthe board, and have her bending over me, eyeing me, watching me, ready\r\nto strangle me. There again! keep those glazed eyes away--keep them\r\naway, I say--'\r\n\r\n\"All this time Louis was making a minute examination of Dervilly's\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\n\"The latter presently seemed aware of what he was doing, for he\r\nexclaimed, 'The usual symptoms, _eh, mon Professeur_; strongly marked,\r\n_n'est ce pas_? Act promptly and decisively, as you say sometimes. Let\r\nblood--let blood--_appliquez des sangsues_--ha, ha, ha! that's what we\r\ncall bleeding, both general and local, ha, ha, ha! then come on with\r\nyour cold applications: ice, ice, a mountain of ice piled round about\r\nthe head! follow up with cathartics, refrigerant diaphoretics, after\r\ndepleting blister!--say you not so?--blisters to the nape of the\r\nneck--blisters behind the ears--shave the scalp--I forgot that--shave\r\nthe scalp--strange I had not thought of it,--and the hair. _Mon\r\nProfesseur_, I know you will think me very foolish, but--save the\r\nhair--I shan't have another growth--save the hair. Where was I?--ah, the\r\nblisters--that will pretty nearly do for me--keep every thing quiet,\r\nvery quiet--after a while, digitalis and nitre--digitalis and nitre,\r\n_mon Professeur_--have I not said my lesson well?'\r\n\r\n\"Louis stood perfectly still, regarding the poor fellow with a mournful\r\ninterest. As Dervilly paused, he took off his spectacles, and wiped his\r\neyes. 'Ah, Monsieur Louis, you talk very eloquently about medical\r\nscience, but I baffle you; I am sure of it. Call the class\r\ntogether--_Ah, Notre Dame de Pitie_--call the class together; _voila la\r\nclinique_. Thus being thus, it must necessarily be thus. That's a wise\r\nsaying, _mon Professeur_. Call the class together; propound why of\r\nnecessity you can do nothing? because of a necessity nothing can be\r\ndone. Call the class together; be active--vigorously antiphlogistic;\r\ntime is precious--the patient in danger. Purgatives--I doubt as to\r\npurgatives. What think you?' And Dervilly paused, and cast on Louis a\r\nlook so naturally inquiring, that the latter replied, as it were,\r\ninvoluntarily, '_Moi aussi je doute._' And it was so; with all his\r\ngenius, all his knowledge, all his experience, and all his skill, the\r\ngreat practitioner stood, while minute after minute was lost, apparently\r\nhesitating what to do. At last he called me into the other room. 'Is it\r\nnot possible to find Mademoiselle de Coigny?' he inquired.\r\n\r\n\"'I have no means of knowing where to seek her,' I replied. At the same\r\ntime I remembered she was in the habit of visiting the house in which\r\nDervilly first met her, and fortunately knew the street and number.\r\n\r\n\"'Let her be sent for instantly,' said Louis. 'Do not go yourself; you\r\nmay be of service here.' Accordingly I gave Stabb the direction, and\r\ninstructed him to procure Mademoiselle de Coigny's address, if possible;\r\nbut if he were unsuccessful in this, to communicate the fact of\r\nDervilly's alarming illness, and beg that Mademoiselle might be\r\nimmediately summoned.\r\n\r\n\"We returned to the sick room, and Louis, seating himself in a chair,\r\nremained lost in thought for nearly a quarter of an hour, while I did\r\nwhat I could, to pacify the sufferer. I could not help wondering that a\r\nman, so prompt and so efficient, should lose a moment when the least\r\ndelay was to be avoided; and as I was reflecting on this, Louis rose so\r\nsuddenly from his seat that I was startled. 'There is but one course,\r\nand the poor boy has very accurately defined it. Let his head be shaved,\r\nand pillowed in ice; bleed him at once--if he faints, all the better.'\r\n'No danger of that,' shouted Dervilly. 'No syncope with me but the\r\n_last_ syncope--no syncope--ha, ha, ha! double the ounces--you are\r\ntimid--no syncope, I say--' He continued the whole time raving, much in\r\nthe manner I have described. The room was kept quite dark, and no one\r\nwas permitted to come in. Louis did not leave the bedside the entire\r\nnight. Dervilly never slept for an instant. On one occasion he threw\r\nhimself close on one side, and screamed, 'Take her away--take her away!'\r\n\r\n\"'What is it?' I asked.\r\n\r\n\"'Do you not see her?' he shrieked, 'sitting on the bed, looking into my\r\neyes; take her away, take her away!'\r\n\r\n\"I need not detail to you,\" continued Partridge, \"the whole of these\r\nfearful scenes. Late in the evening Stabb returned; he had found the\r\nhouse; and although he could not obtain Mademoiselle de Coigny's\r\naddress, he was promised that his message should be communicated early\r\nin the morning.\r\n\r\n\"'It will be too late,' said Louis, mournfully.\r\n\r\n\"What a long night it was. The morning dawned at last, but it brought no\r\nchange to poor Dervilly. I had sent for his nearest relative, who lived\r\nover on the _Boulevard Poissonniere_, and was awaiting his arrival with\r\nconsiderable anxiety. It was not later than nine. Stabb, the good\r\nfellow, had relieved me from my watch, and I was in the sitting-room, in\r\nmy large arm-chair, still anxious and fearful, when there came a slight\r\ntap at the door; it opened--and Emilie de Coigny stood before me. Ah,\r\nhow beautiful she was, yet how terrified! It was not terror of\r\nexcitement--mere surface passion--but from the depths of her soul. She\r\nwas stirred by intense emotion. 'Tell me,' she said, coming earnestly up\r\nto me, 'tell me where he is, and what has happened to him!' I put my\r\nfinger on my lips to prevent her from saying more, and led her to the\r\nfurther corner of the room; but she would not sit down; she begged to be\r\ntold every thing at once; and I, in a low voice, gave Mademoiselle do\r\nCoigny a minute account of all I had witnessed. When I came to\r\nDervilly's exclamation, '_La Morgue--La Morgue_,' the young girl became\r\nsuddenly very pale, her fortitude forsook her, and she murmured faintly,\r\n'He saw me go in--he saw me go in.' I must admit I was, for the moment,\r\nnot a little tremulous. I recollected stories of devils taking\r\npossession of the dead bodies of virgins, in order to lure young men to\r\nperdition. I thought of the tale of the German student, who, on retiring\r\nwith his bride, beheld her head roll from her body (she had been\r\nguillotined that morning), leaving him wedded to the foul fiend. In\r\nspite of me, I looked on the pale stricken creature before me as in one\r\nway or another connected with the adversary, and holding a commission\r\nfrom the Prince of the Power of the Air. I had little time for thought\r\non the subject, for Mademoiselle de Coigny insisted on seeing Dervilly.\r\nI hesitated, but she was decided. She threw aside her pretty straw hat,\r\nand a light shawl, and stepped toward the apartment where her lover lay.\r\nShe passed the threshold before he saw her. She called him by his name,\r\n'Alfred.' He turned, and as his eyes fell on her, he uttered mad\r\nexclamations; crouching frantically in the furthest corner of the bed.\r\n'Avaunt,' he screamed; 'vampyre--devil--owl of hell--come no nearer,\r\n(she still advanced, calling to him tenderly); I know that syren voice;\r\nit has damned and double damned me.--Partridge! Stabb! take her away,\r\nor,' he continued, in a fierce tone, 'I will do second execution on\r\nher.'\r\n\r\n\"Poor girl--it was too much--she swooned away....\r\n\r\n\"You may imagine that it was a terrible scene,\" continued Partridge. \"I\r\nset to work immediately for her recovery, having first carried her out\r\nof the room where Dervilly lay. She opened her eyes at last, but what a\r\nlook of anguish was in them! 'Is he better?' she asked in a faint tone.\r\nI shook my head. 'Tell me,' she exclaimed, 'will he die? oh, will he,\r\n_must_ he die?'\r\n\r\n\"'He is very sick, Mademoiselle.'\r\n\r\n\"'I have killed him, I have killed him,' she cried.\r\n\r\n\"'Pardon me', said I, 'Monsieur Dervilly is in great danger; still if we\r\nknew the cause of this dreadful attack we might gain some advantage by\r\nit.'\r\n\r\n\"'Ah, it is my work,' murmured the fair mystery to herself, without\r\nheeding my observation; 'I have done it, and if he dies, I am a\r\nmurderer--_his_ murderer.' She appeared no way disposed to betray her\r\nsecret, and I did not press the subject. Presently Louis came in. He\r\nmade his inquiries of me, and then went to the patient. There was no\r\nchange, except in the increase of fatal symptoms. The delirium was more\r\nfurious, the pulse hard, full, frequent, and vibrating. The most\r\nvigorous course was adopted; two other students were called in to assist\r\nStabb and myself, and every means used to give effect to the prescribed\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n\"As for Mademoiselle de Coigny, she remained in the sitting-room, the\r\npicture of intense anguish. I urged her to retire, but she shook her\r\nhead. I now begged her to tell me what had caused this strange attack,\r\nbut she was silent. At length I went and called Madame Lecomte--you\r\nrecollect what a kind-hearted creature she was--and told her briefly the\r\nlittle I knew of the unfortunate girl. She answered the summons at once,\r\nand in the most gentle manner endeavored to persuade Mademoiselle de\r\nCoigny to go with her. It was in vain. She would not leave the room.\r\nOccasionally, through the day, she would step to Dervilly's bedside, and\r\nin the softest, sweetest, gentlest tone I ever heard, say, 'Alfred.' The\r\neffect was always the same as at first--exciting the poor fellow to\r\nstill deeper paroxysms, and more violent exclamations. On the fourth day\r\nhe died; the symptoms becoming more and more aggravating, until _coma_\r\nsupervened to delirium. During the whole period of his sickness\r\nMademoiselle de Coigny never left the house--scarcely the room--Madame\r\nLecomte on two or three occasions almost forcing the wretched girl away\r\nto her own apartments. When poor Dervilly sunk into that deep lethargic\r\nslumber, so much dreaded by the physician, because so fatal, she came\r\nalmost joyfully into his chamber, and threw her arms tenderly around\r\nhim, 'He sleeps at last,' she said, 'is it not well?'\r\n\r\n\"I would have given the world for the freedom of bursting into tears, so\r\ndeeply was I affected by that hopeful, trustful question. What could I\r\ndo, but shake my head mournfully and hasten out of the place.... He\r\ndied, and made no sign; not a word, not a look, not the slightest\r\npressure of the hand, for the one he loved so tenderly, and who watched\r\nso anxiously for some slight token. 'Oh,' I exclaimed to myself, as the\r\nhardness of such a fate was impressed on me, 'God is just, there is a\r\nhereafter, these two _must_ meet again.' ... Emilie de Coigny left the\r\nroom where her dead lover lay, only when he himself was borne to his\r\nlast resting-place. She followed him to the spot where he was buried in\r\n_Pere la Chaise_, and remained standing by it after every one else had\r\ncome away. In this position she was found--standing over the grave--late\r\nat night by her friends--some members of the family I have\r\nmentioned--who sought her out. She left that splendid city of the dead\r\nbereft of reason, and so she has ever since continued. When the day is\r\nfine, she invariably keeps her fancied engagement with her lover at the\r\nappointed place in the _Jardin des Plants_; she patiently sits the hour,\r\nand retires sadly, as you saw her. When the weather is forbidding, she\r\ngoes to her friend's house and waits the same period, never showing the\r\nleast symptom of impatience, but, on the contrary, evincing the signs of\r\na bruised but most gentle spirit.\" ...\r\n\r\nHere Partridge paused, as if at the end of his story.\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"That is all,\" he responded.\r\n\r\n\"Surely not,\" I continued; \"you have said nothing about the strange\r\nmystery which killed our poor friend, and which, as it seems to me, is\r\nthe main point, in the story.\"\r\n\r\n\"True enough--it is singular I should have left it out, but it is\r\nexplained in a word. These same friends of Mademoiselle de Coigny gave\r\nme the information. It appears that on one inclement night, as the\r\n_keeper of the Morgue_ was returning from an official visit to the Chief\r\nof Police, toward his own quarters, which are adjoining and over the\r\n_dead room_--he stumbled over something which a flash of lightning at\r\nthe instant showed to be the body of a man. He was quite dead, but,\r\nnestled down close by his side, with one of her little hands on his\r\nface, was a child, about two years of age. Jean Maurice Sorel, although\r\nlong inured to repulsive sights, had not grown callous to misery. By\r\nbirth he was considerably above his somewhat ignominious office; he had\r\nnarrowly escaped with his life when Louis XVI. was brought to the\r\nscaffold, for some indiscreet expressions that savored too much of\r\nroyalty; but in the tumults which succeeded, he had, he scarcely knew\r\nhow, through some influence with the chief of one of the departments,\r\nbeen appointed to this repulsive duty. But as I have said, his heart was\r\njust as kind as ever, after many years discharge of it; and Jean Maurice\r\nSorel, instead of repining at his lot, blessed God daily that he had the\r\nmeans of supporting a wife and children, while so many of his old\r\nfriends had literally starved to death. Such was the person who stumbled\r\nover the body of the dead man, and discovered the living child beside\r\nit. He called at once for assistance, and had the corpse conveyed to his\r\nhouse, while he carried the little girl in his arms. She was too young\r\nto give any information about herself, but on searching the pockets of\r\nthe deceased, several papers were found which disclosed enough to\r\nsatisfy Jean Maurice Sorel that in the wasted, attenuated form before\r\nhim, he beheld his once friend and benefactor the Marquis de Coigny,\r\nwho, he supposed, had perished by the guillotine in the revolution. The\r\npapers permitted no doubt of the fact that the little girl was his\r\ngranddaughter and only descendant, and she was commended to the care of\r\nthe kind-hearted when death should overtake him.\r\n\r\n\"The old Marquis was buried, and the little Emilie adopted into the\r\nfamily of the good Jean Maurice. Her education was conducted in a manner\r\nfar superior to that of his own children, and the choicest garments of\r\nthose which fell to him were selected to be made over for her. Perhaps\r\nunwisely, her history was explained to her, so that she lived all her\r\nlife with the sense that she belonged in a different sphere--not that\r\nshe was ungrateful or unamiable--quite the contrary--she was sweet\r\ntempered, affectionate and gentle, and loved by Jean Maurice and all his\r\nfamily with a devoted fondness: but the world had charms for her which\r\nthe world withheld; she felt that she never could become an object of\r\nlove where she could love in return, and so she repined at her destiny.\r\nBy accident she made the acquaintance of the family where Dervilly first\r\nmet her. They had known her father and her grandfather, and she loved\r\nthem for that. She resisted for a long time the feeling for her lover\r\nwhich she perceived was taking strong hold of her, and when she could\r\nresist no longer, she yet delayed to tell him what a home she inhabited.\r\nThis was her pride--her weakness--and how terribly did she pay the\r\npenalty! Day after day (so I was told), she resolved to explain all, but\r\nshe procrastinated, till her lover, no longer able to restrain his\r\nanxiety, and full of excitements and fears and perturbations, followed\r\nher at some little distance, just at twilight, and saw or fancied he saw\r\nher enter _La Morgue_. It was too much for his nervous temperament. His\r\nbrain caught fire--he came home raving with delirium--and DIED! Now you\r\nhave the whole.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LEGEND.\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED FOR THE INTERNATIONAL FROM THE SPANISH,\r\n\r\nBY MRS. M. E. HEWITT.\r\n\r\n    \"Sin vos, y sin Dios y mi.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    The motto that with trembling hand I write,\r\n      And deep is traced upon this heart of mine,\r\n    In olden time a loyal Christian knight\r\n      Bore graven on his shield to Palestine.\r\n\r\n    \"_Sin vos_,\" it saith, \"if I am without thee,\"\r\n      Beloved! whose thought surrounds me every where--\r\n    \"_Sin Dios_,\" I am without God, \"_y mi_,\"\r\n      And in myself I have no longer share.\r\n\r\n    Where pealed the clash of war, the mighty din,\r\n      Where trump and cymbal crashed along the sky;\r\n    High o'er the \"Il Allah!\" of the Moslemin,\r\n      \"God and my lady!\" rang his battle-cry.\r\n\r\n    His white plume waved where fiercest raged the flight,\r\n      His arm was strong the Paynim's course to stem:\r\n    His foot was foremost on the sacred height,\r\n      To plant the Cross above Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n    False proved the lady, and thenceforth the knight,\r\n      Casting aside the buckler and the brand,\r\n    Lived, an austere and lonely anchorite,\r\n      In a drear mountain-cave in Holy Land.\r\n\r\n    There, bowed before the Crucifix in prayer,\r\n      He would dash madly down his rosary,\r\n    And cry \"Beloved!\" in tones of wild despair,\r\n      \"I have lost God, and self, in losing thee!\"\r\n\r\n    And I, if thus my life's sweet hope were o'er,\r\n      An echo of the knight's despair must be;\r\n    Thus I were lost, if loved by thee no more,\r\n      For, ah! myself and heaven are merged in thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAGLIOSTRO, THE MAGICIAN.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES WYLLYS ELLIOT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Know, then, that in the year 1743, in the city of Palermo, the family\r\nof Signor Pietro Balsamo, a shopkeeper, were exhilarated by the birth of\r\na boy. Such occurrences have now become so frequent, that, miraculous as\r\nthey are, they occasion little astonishment;\" and, it may be well to\r\nadd, that, except in some curious cases, there is no longer that\r\nexhilaration now felt, but, as in Ireland, a leaden sense of future woe.\r\nWe are not told by the parents that any strange or miraculous appearance\r\nattended or preceded this advent, though one cannot but believe that the\r\nfuture Archimagus and his followers must have had a more or less\r\ndistinct opinion upon this point. Not to lose time in speculation, we\r\nlearn that \"we have here found in the Count Alessandro di Cagliostro\r\n(the above-named boy), pupil of the sage, Altholas--foster-child of the\r\nScherif of Mecca--probable son of the last king of Trebizond; named also\r\nAcharat, and unfortunate child of nature; by profession, healer of\r\ndiseases, abolisher of wrinkles, friend of the poor and impotent,\r\ngrand-master of the Egyptian Mason lodge of High Science, spirit\r\nsummoner, gold cork, grand cophta, prophet, priest, and thaurmaturgic\r\nmoralist and swindler; really a LIAR of the first magnitude;\r\nthorough-paced in all provinces of lying, what one may call their king.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the common tent, the great canopy of life, it would not be fair to\r\nprejudge the mind of the reader upon so grave a thing as character,\r\nwhich we are now considering--it might be best to let each come to an\r\nafter-thought respecting it--upon our caustic and noble author let the\r\nblame, if any, hang, while we now proceed to dip in, here and there, to\r\nhis magic page.\r\n\r\nAs the boy grows, we learn, that \"as he skulks about there, plundering,\r\npilfering, playing dog's-tricks, with his finger in every mischief, he\r\nalready gains character. Shrill housewives of the neighborhood, whose\r\nsausages he has filched, whose weaker sons maltreated, name him Beppo\r\nMaldetto, and indignantly prophecy that he will be hanged--a prediction\r\nwhich the issue has signally falsified.\" We also may learn, what, in the\r\ntreatment of our whole subject it is extremely important to remember,\r\nthat, in the \"boy,\" a \"brazen impudence developes itself, the crowning\r\ngift,\" &c. \"To his astonishment,\" though, \"he finds that even here he is\r\nin a conditional world, and if he will employ his capability of eating\r\n(or enjoying) must first, in some measure, work and suffer. Contention\r\nenough hereupon; but now dimly arises, or reproduces itself, the\r\nquestion. Whether there were not a _shorter_ road--that of stealing!\"\r\n\r\nBut how he was entered into the convent, and under the convent\r\napothecary proceeded to learn certain arts and mysteries of the retorts\r\nand alembics (which lucky knowledge, after that, came to use), while he\r\nwas learning his other trade of monkery and mass-chanting, we will omit.\r\nIt is enough to know, that he would not answer for the convent, and was\r\nagain afloat on the wide sea of existence. That he floated is certain;\r\nfor \"he has a fair cousin living in the house with him, and she again\r\nhas a lover. Beppo stations himself as go-between; delivers letters;\r\nfails not to drop hints that a lady to be won or kept must be generously\r\ntreated; that such and such a pair of ear-rings, watch, or sum of money,\r\nwould work wonders: which valuables, adds the wooden Roman biographer,\r\nhe then appropriated furtively.\" Slowly but certainly he makes his way:\r\n\"tries his hand at forging\" theatre tickets--a will even, \"for the\r\nbenefit of a certain religious house;\" and, further on, can tell\r\nfortunes, and show visions in a small way--all these inspirations are\r\nvouchsafed him, or, rather, these things he is permitted to do, and\r\nothers not to be mentioned here.\r\n\r\nIt is well to note, that in all times, and among all peoples, there is a\r\ndeep and profound conviction that there _is_ not only a \"short and\r\ncertain\" way of getting to heaven, and to know the eternal truths, but\r\nalso that these earthly treasures do exist, in untold quantity, in the\r\nelements; and if one could only discover the secret by which the gases\r\ncould be condensed into solid gold, or the gnomes be persuaded or\r\ncompelled to give them up, ready solidified to hand, it would at least\r\nsave time and be satisfactory. It is only curious, as a matter of\r\nspeculation, to know what we shall eat when the lucky age arrives, and\r\nspirits will do our bidding in this matter of gold and diamonds. The\r\n\"boy,\" as he grew, discovered this world-wide capacity; and who should\r\nhave this power of setting the \"spirits\" to work but he?\r\n\r\n\"Walking one day in the fields with a certain ninny of a goldsmith,\r\nnamed Marano, Beppo begins in his oily voluble way to hint that\r\ntreasures often lay hid; that a certain treasure lay hid there (as he\r\nknew by some pricking of his thumbs, divining rod, or other talismanic\r\nmonition), which treasure might, by the aid of science, courage,\r\nsecrecy, and a small judicious advance of money, be fortunately lifted.\r\nThe gudgeon takes--advances, by degrees, to the length of 'sixty gold\r\nounces'--sees magic circles drawn in the wane or the full of the moon,\r\nblue (phosphorous) flames arise--split twigs auspiciously quiver--and at\r\nlength demands, peremptorily, that the treasure be dug!\"\r\n\r\nAlas! why is it that the \"spirits\" so often fail us at our sorest need?\r\nDo _they_ deceive us; and, if not, who does? The treasure vanishes, or\r\ndoes not appear, \"the conditions are imperfect,\" and the \"ninny of a\r\ngoldsmith\" being roughly handled by these spiritual visitants,\r\nthreatens to stiletto the adept; who, overcome with the ingratitude of\r\nthe world, concludes to quit;--at least, in the words of his Inquisition\r\nbiographer, \"he fled from Palermo, and overran the whole earth.\"\r\n\r\nWe may see how he has grown--how, as in ordinary mortals, he advances\r\nstep by step--even he, the favorite son of the higher intelligences,\r\nlearns as he goes. How is it, then, that we can have no full-grown\r\ninspiration; that we know of no perfection--that we only go on towards\r\nit? Can it be that prophets and priests really do _learn_, and that even\r\nnow, men may grow into the future? Might not a more thorough and\r\nscientific seminary for this purpose be established than any we now\r\nhave--theologic, thaumaturgic, theosophic, or other variety? It is a\r\nquestion easier asked than answered.\r\n\r\n\"The Beppic Hegira brings us down in European history to somewhere about\r\nthe period of the peace of Paris\"--(A.D. ----), supervening upon which\r\nis a portentous time--\"the multitudinous variety of quacks that, along\r\nwith Beppo, overran all Europe during that same period--the latter half\r\nof the last century. It was the very age of impostors, cut-purses,\r\nswindlers, double gaugers, enthusiasts, ambiguous persons, quacks\r\nsimple, quacks compound, crack-brained or with deceit prepense, quacks\r\nand quackeries of all colors and kinds. How many mesmerists (so speaks\r\nthis strange author), magicians, cabalists, Swedenborgians, illuminati,\r\ncrucified nuns, and devils of Loudun! To which the Inquisition\r\nbiographer adds vampyres, sylphs, rosicrucians, free-masons, and an _et\r\ncetera_. Consider your Schropfers, Cagliostros, Casanovas, Saint\r\nGermains, Dr. Grahams, the Chevalier d'Eon, Psalmanazar, Abbe Paris, and\r\nthe Ghost of Cock-lane!--as if Bedlam had broken loose!\"\r\n\r\nThe great, the inexplicable, the mysterious Beppo, being now fairly\r\nafloat, let us try to comprehend how he has begun to touch upon the edge\r\nof those trade winds, which shall drive him along toward the golden\r\nIndies, Ophir, and the land of promise, for which the men of this world\r\ndo so hunger and thirst.\r\n\r\nHe married a beautiful Seraphina, afterward countess, graceful and\r\nlady-like, once the daughter of a girdle-maker, and named Lorenza\r\nFeliciani. Every one, simple or sedate, knows that it is best to hunt in\r\ncouples. What one has not the other may have. So Seraphina had beauty,\r\nlightness, buoyancy, and could float up her count when the demons and\r\nharpies of a certain troublesome devil, called law or justice, seemed\r\nbent upon his swift destruction. Could she not, too, \"enlist the\r\nsympathies of admiring audiences\"--by her sweet smiles and \"artless\r\nways,\" gain belief, and \"a wish to believe?\" More than that, could she\r\nnot turn the heads of young and old? \"noble\" perhaps, perhaps\r\n\"ignoble\"--\"moneyed do-nothings\" (so says this writer), whereof in this\r\nvexed earth there are many, ever lounging about such (?) places--scan\r\nand comment on the foreign coat-of-arms--ogle the fair foreign woman,\r\nwho timidly recoils from their gaze, timidly responds to their\r\nreverences, as in halls and passages they obsequiously throw themselves\r\nin her way. Ere long, one moneyed do-nothing (from amid his tags,\r\ntassels, sword-belts, fop-tackle, frizzled hair, without brains beneath\r\nit) is heard speaking to another--\"Seen the countess?--divine creature\r\nthat!\" Indeed, one cannot but wonder that any should question the unity\r\nof the race, at least, of those known as \"civilized.\" In a small way, or\r\nin a large way, how this thing ever goes on--on church steps, on\r\nBroadways, in Metropolitan Halls, Congresses, the Palais-Royal, at home\r\nand abroad! And men do yet call _this_ \"reverence for the sex,\" and holy\r\nsentiment; and indulge in hallelujahs to that hoary myth, \"a gentleman\r\nof the old school;\" while women--God help us--women loving it, hate\r\nthose who, hating it, hate hollowness and hell. With slight imagination,\r\nthen, one may see how important an element this \"divine creature\" must\r\nhave become in any conjuration or mystic \"renovation of the universe,\"\r\nwhich the high mystagogue might be impressed to set on foot. Enough,\r\nthat _she_ helped and learned the arts of prophecy and perfection faster\r\nthan her master! But we read--alas! alas!--\"As his seraphic countess\r\ngives signs of withering, and one luxuriant branch of industry will die\r\nand drop off, others must be pushed into budding.\" He, the indefatigable\r\ncount, is not idle. \"Faded dames of quality (over all Europe, all\r\ncreation) have many wants: the count has not studied in the convent\r\nlaboratory, or pilgrimed to the Count St. Germain, in Westphalia, to no\r\npurpose. With loftiest condescension he stoops to impart somewhat of his\r\nsupernatural secrets--for a _consideration_. Rowland's Kalydor is\r\nvaluable; but what to the beautifying water of Count Alessandro! He that\r\nwill undertake to smooth wrinkles, and make withered, green parchment\r\ninto a fair carnation skin, is he not one whom faded dames of quality\r\nwill delight to honor? Or, again, let the beautifying-water succeed or\r\nnot, have not such dames (if calumny may in aught be believed) another\r\nwant? This want, too, the indefatigable Cagliostro will supply--for a\r\nconsideration. For faded gentlemen of quality the count likewise has\r\nhelp. Not a charming countess alone, but a \"wine of Egypt\" (Cantharides\r\nnot being unknown to him), sold in drops, more precious than nectar;\r\nwhich, what faded gentlemen of quality will not purchase with any thing\r\nshort of life. Consider, too, what may be done with potions, washes,\r\ncharms, love-philters, among a class of mortals idle from their mother's\r\nwomb,\" &c., &c.\r\n\r\nIt is well to know, once for all, that the count, chief-priest of his\r\norder--which yet thrives, and if not great, deserves to be called for\r\nits number, Legion--made money out of this his enterprising trade; that\r\nhe was enabled to pay his way; to ride post with the ever potent\r\n\"voucher of respectability, a coach-and-four,\" with out-riders and\r\nbeef-eaters, and couriers and lackeys, and the other paraphernalia which\r\nthe greedy tooth of man desires--which helps one forward so far toward\r\nhappiness, provided always that \"there _is_ no heaven above and no hell\r\nbeneath,\" of which let each first make sure; and more than all, let such\r\nas wish to travel this road, take great courage from the contemplation\r\nof this one model.\r\n\r\nWe must hasten to the year 1776, a year rather noted in our annals, and\r\nin that of England, perhaps, independently of this the \"first visit\" of\r\nthe famed Count Cagliostro to its shores, which happened then. Should it\r\nhave so chanced that he had lived now, would he have stopped there does\r\nthe reader think? Having an insight into _their_ national character, and\r\nfinding \"great greed and need,\" and but small heed, what might he not\r\nhave done on this transatlantic shore, whose free people can so nobly\r\ncherish even its Barnum, its----, its----! But let names go. We make the\r\nmost of what we have, and if not equal to the greatest, the fault rests\r\nnot on our shoulders. We are not responsible for the past, if for the\r\npresent or future.\r\n\r\n'Twas in England that the master developed most bravely the art of\r\nprophecy; perhaps finding there a demand for his supply--such, according\r\nto some, being the only law of God or man. It is enough to know that he\r\ndoes a trade in foretelling the lucky lottery numbers by means of his\r\n\"occult science,\" whereby at least he put money in _his_ purse, and\r\nsatisfied good-natured men that as there were gulls, and necessarily a\r\nguller, he above all others deserved praise and not blame; the whole\r\nthing, this life, being really a juggle, and the smartest fellow of\r\ncourse the best juggler. As man goes on he developes, so many think--so\r\ndid Cagliostro, and in his growth he reaches to masonry--Egyptian\r\nmasonry--and in \"sworn secrecy\" finds a new Talisman, for which men will\r\npay five guineas each. He resolves to \"free it from all vile\r\ningredients, and make it a new Evangile.\" \"No religion is excluded from\r\nthe Egyptian society\"--for is it not certain that religion _pays_?\r\nCharity too, pays, as we shall see by-and-by. No religion is\r\ntabooed--none--all who admit the existence of a God, and the immortality\r\nof the soul, may, for the small sum of five guineas, be certain to gain\r\n\"perfection by means of a physical and moral regeneration.\" He promises\r\nthem by the former or physical to find the _prime matter_ or\r\nphilosopher's stone, and the _acacia_ which consolidates in man the\r\nforces of the most vigorous youth, and renders him immortal; and by the\r\nlatter or moral, to procure them a Pentagon which shall restore man to\r\nhis primitive state of innocence, lost by his original sin. It must be\r\nunderstood that this masonry was founded by Enoch and Elias, had been\r\ncorrupted by the Egyptian priests, but was now restored to its pristine\r\nvigor by its last and greatest Grand Cophta, and includes not only men\r\nbut women, of whom the Countess Seraphina is Cophtess.\r\n\r\nWe cannot do better than to gain some insight into the forms and\r\nsymbolic practices of these worshippers; and especially will those who\r\ndesire to practise this or any short and easy way to perfection or\r\nhappiness, be glad to learn what has been done, and thus be encouraged\r\nto begin.\r\n\r\nIn the _Essai sur les Illumines_, printed in Paris in 1789, are the\r\nfollowing details quoted by this before-mentioned known author.[1] These\r\nbear an air of truth and probability which will win for them easy\r\nadmission. Many of them are not unlike what we have seen amongst us\r\nduring the few past years.\r\n\r\n\"They take a young lad or a girl who is in the state of innocence: such\r\nthey call the _Pupil_ or _Colomb_: the Venerable communicates to him the\r\npower he would have had before the fall of man; which power consists\r\nmainly in commanding the pure spirits: these spirits are to the number\r\nof seven. It is said they surround the shrine, and that they govern the\r\nseven planets. Their names are Arael, Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, Uriel,\r\nZobiachel, Anachiel.\" Nothing certainly can begin more favorably. We\r\nlearn that \"she the Colomb,\" can act in two ways, either behind a\r\ncurtain, behind a hieroglyphically-painted screen with table and three\r\ncandles, or before the Caraffe and showing face. If the _miracle fail_\r\nit can only be because she is not \"in the state of innocence.\" _An\r\naccident must be guarded against._ Surely our mystic professors, both\r\nclerical and lay, will take heed to these things. Much may be learned.\r\n\r\nCagliostro accordingly (it is his own story) brought a little boy into\r\nthe lodge, son of a nobleman there. He placed him on his knees before a\r\ntable, whereon stood a bottle of pure water, and behind this some\r\nlighted candles. He made an exorcism round the boy, put his hand on\r\nhead, and both in this attitude addressed their prayers to God for the\r\nhappy accomplishment of the work. Having then bid the child look into\r\nthe bottle, directly the child cried that he saw a garden. Knowing\r\nhereby that Heaven assisted him [why this is so proven he does not\r\nexplain], Cagliostro took courage, and bade the child ask of God the\r\ngrace to see the Archangel Michael. At first the child said, \"I see\r\nsomething white; I know not what it is.\" Then he began jumping and\r\nstamping like a possessed creature, and cried, \"Now, I see a child like\r\nmyself, which seems to have something angelical (!)\" _All the assembly\r\nand Cagliostro himself remained speechless with emotion...._ [How like\r\nthis is to what we at this day have seen.] The child being anew\r\nexorcised with the hands of the Venerable on his head, and the customary\r\nprayers addressed to Heaven, he looked into the bottle, and said he saw\r\nhis sister at that moment coming down stairs, and embracing one of her\r\nbrothers. That appeared impossible, the brother in question being then\r\nhundreds of miles off. However Cagliostro felt not disconcerted; said\r\nthey might send to the country-house, where the sister was, and see--if\r\nthey chose!\r\n\r\nDo some still doubt? Time nor paper will allow us to allay that doubt.\r\nWe must, as rapidly as we can, introduce what may yet be useful in\r\ncertain cases of the like kind, either in whole or in part. It is the\r\nintroduction of a novice into the holy Mysteries.\r\n\r\n\"The recipiendary is led by a darksome path into a large hall, the\r\nceiling, the walls, the floor of which are covered by a black cloth,\r\nsprinkled over with red flames and menacing serpents; three sepulchral\r\nlamps emit from time to time a dying glimmer, and the eye half\r\ndistinguishes, in this lugubrious den, certain wrecks of mortality\r\nsuspended by funeral crapes; a heap of skeletons forms in the centre a\r\nsort of altar; on both sides of it are piled books; some contain menaces\r\nagainst the perjured; others the deadly narrative of the vengeance which\r\nthe invisible spirit has exacted; of the infernal evocations for a long\r\ntime pronounced in vain.\r\n\r\n\"Eight hours elapse. Then phantoms, trailing mortuary vails, slowly\r\ncross the hall and sink in caverns, without audible noise of trapdoors\r\nor of falling. You notice only that they are gone by a fetid odor\r\nexhaled from them.\r\n\r\n\"The novice remains four and twenty hours in this gloomy abode, in the\r\nmidst of a freezing silence. A rigorous fast has already weakened his\r\nthinking faculties. Liquors prepared for the purpose first weary and at\r\nlength wear out his senses. At his feet are placed three cups, filled\r\nwith a drink of a greenish color. Necessity lifts them to his lips:\r\ninvoluntary fear repels them.\r\n\r\n\"At last appear two men: looked upon as the ministers of Death. These\r\ngird the pale brow of the recipiendary with an auroral-colored-ribbon\r\ndipped in blood, and full of silvered characters mixed with our lady of\r\nLoretto. He receives a copper crucifix, of two inches length: to his\r\nneck are hung a sort of amulets wrapped in violet cloth. He is stripped\r\nof his clothes; which two ministering brethren deposit on a funeral\r\npile, erected at the other end of the hall. With blood on his naked body\r\nare traced crosses. In this state of suffering and humiliation, he sees\r\napproaching with large strides five Phantoms armed with swords, and clad\r\nin garments dropping blood. Their faces are vailed: they spread a velvet\r\ncarpet on the floor; kneel there, pray; and remain with outstretched\r\nhands crossed on their breasts, and faces fixed on the ground in deep\r\nsilence. An hour passes in this painful attitude. After which fatiguing\r\ntrial, plaintive cries are heard; the funeral pile takes fire, yet casts\r\nonly a pale light; the garments are thrown on it and burnt. A colossal\r\nand almost transparent figure rises from the very bosom of the pile. At\r\nsight of it the five prostrated men fall into convulsions insupportable\r\nto look on: the too faithful image of those foaming struggles wherein a\r\nmortal, at hand-grips with a sudden pain, ends by sinking under it.\r\n\r\n\"Then a trembling voice pierces the vault, and articulates the formula\r\nof those execrable oaths that are to be sworn: my pen falters: I think\r\nmyself almost guilty to retrace them.\"\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, we stop here with Monsieur the Author. Strange\r\ntoo that some deny the reality of all this--and tell of magic lanterns\r\nand science--stranger still that men are who believe all--all--'tis to\r\nthem a spasmodic miracle, and he is an infidel of course who doubts.\r\nStrange too is it, that men do not see here the monstrous power of what\r\nis called Symbolism, and that they should not help nor hinder; who say,\r\nLet the world go--who cares! Men live and women too who say, \"There's\r\n_something_ in it\"--there must be! and is there not? Figure now all this\r\nboundless cunningly devised agglomerate of royal arches, deaths' heads,\r\nhieroglyphically painted screens, \"columns in the state of innocence,\r\nwith spacious masonic halls--dark, or in the favorablest theatrical\r\nlight-and-dark: Kircher's magic lantern, Belshazzar handwritings (of\r\nphosphorus), plaintive tones, gong-beatings, hoary head of a\r\nsupernatural Grand Cophta emerging through the gloom--and how it all\r\nacts, not only directly through the foolish senses of men, but also\r\nindirectly connecting itself with Enoch and Elias, with philanthropy,\r\nimmortality,\" &c. Let such as _will_ now say there is nothing in\r\nit--something there is, for a thoughtful man to consider well of, asking\r\nhimself what also does this of clairvoyance, and spiritual knockings,\r\nand Jenny-Lind manias, and Jerkers--truly mean? and what kind of a\r\nperson am _I who have had_ part and lot with these?\r\n\r\nBut the lofty science of Egyptian Masonry flourishes, lodges are\r\nestablished over Europe, and the Grand Master travels hither and\r\nthither, \"mounts to the seat of the Venerable, and holds high discourse,\r\nhours long, on masonry, morality, universal science, divinity, and\r\nthings in general,\" with a \"sublimity, and emphasis and unction,\"\r\nproceeding it appears \"from the special inspiration of the Holy Ghost.\"\r\nHe is received with shouts and exultation--every where the great heart\r\nof man thrills at the coming of this mystic symbol, which\r\ncontains--cunningly enfolded, as their eyes can and do see--every\r\nvirtue, every greatness--is he not indeed the Incarnation of these, and\r\ntherefore to be worshipped; such gift of reverence is in the heart of\r\nman, and to such things does he again and again bow down!\r\n\r\nTo go on. Cheers, and the ravishment of thronging audiences can make him\r\nmaudlin; render him louder in eloquence of theory; and \"philanthropy,\"\r\n\"divine science,\" \"depth of unknown worlds,\" \"finer feelings of the\r\nheart\"--and so shall draw tears from most asses of sensibility. \"The few\r\nreasoning mortals scattered here and there, that see through him,\r\ndeafened in the universal hub-bub, shut their lips in sorrowful disdain,\r\n_confident in the grand remedy, Time_.\" So says our author, and can we\r\nblame him? Will the reader allow the current of this prosperity to be\r\nchecked for one moment by a certain Count M.? One of the chosen few at\r\nWarsaw, who having spent the night with the \"dear Master,\" in conversing\r\nwith spirits, had returned to the country to transmute metals\r\nperhaps--perhaps to do other mighty works. Count M. seems to have been\r\nafflicted with doubts, to have supposed that by sleight-of-hand the\r\n\"sweet Master\" had substituted the crucible with melted ducats, for the\r\nother--carefully filled with red lead, \"smelted and set to cool,\" \"and\r\nnow found broken and hidden among these bushes\"--the whole golden\r\ncrucible standing in its place. \"Neither does the Plenagon or Elixir of\r\nLife, or whatever it was, prosper better--our sweet master enters into\r\nexpostulation--swears by his great God, and his honor, that he will\r\nfinish the work and make us _happy_.\" In vain--\"the shreds of the broken\r\ncrucible lie there before your eyes\"--and the usurper has its place.\r\nThat \"resemblance of a sleeping child, grown visible in the magic\r\ncooking of our Elixir, proves to be an inserted rosemary leaf. The Grand\r\nCophta cannot be gone too soon.\"\r\n\r\nAlready it has been said that \"Charity pays,\" philanthropy, benevolence,\r\nall these--sometimes? if one sows his bread on the waters shall he not\r\nexpect its return after many or after few days?--the sooner the better\r\nfor your Cagliostros, your Barnums. Shout it daily to an envious\r\nworld--\"Am I not a charitable man? If I have done wrong myself (as who\r\nhas not?) has not a great deal of good _grown out_ of my wickedness? I\r\nhave therefore done my share, for which if the world has paid me in\r\n'praise and pudding,' it is no more than it has done before, and will do\r\nagain!\" Take courage!\r\n\r\nCagliostro doctors--heals--the poor, for nothing!--even gives them\r\nalms--does a great deal of good--who but he? At Strasburg in the year\r\n1783 (year of our peace with England), he \"appears in full bloom and\r\nradiance, the envy and admiration of the world. In large hired\r\nhospitals, he with open drug-box (containing 'Extract of Saturn'), and\r\neven with open purse, relieves the suffering poor; unfolds himself\r\nlamblike, angelic, to a believing few, of the rich classes. Medical\r\nmiracles have at all times been common, but what miracle is this of an\r\noccidental or oriental Serene-highness that 'regardless of expense,'\r\nemploys himself in curing sickness, in illuminating ignorance?\" We at\r\nthe present day know nothing like it; the mere giving of a few surplus\r\nhundreds or thousands to certain Slavery, Anti-Slavery, Peace,\r\nTemperance or other societies, is benevolence of the \"rocking chair\"\r\nspecies--is not to be mentioned with this, of the self-denying\r\nCagliostro's diving into cellars, and mounting into garrets, to seek and\r\nto save--at the risk of not only life but comfort--the first of which\r\nhappily was not thus sacrificed:--nor indeed on the whole was comfort\r\nlost sight of, as the \"coach-and-four with liveries and sumptuosities\r\nbears witness.\" There is often profound wisdom in this thing called\r\n_public_ or newspaper charity. Does it--or does it not--pay?\r\n\r\nThe favorite of the gods, he who holds high discourse with spirits, and\r\nto whom is opened the hidden secret of earth and heaven, finds ready\r\nacceptance--backed as he is by charities, by elegancies: finds\r\nacceptance with the poor, the ignorant to whom he ministers--but also\r\n\"with a mixture of sorrow and indignation\" it is recorded, among the\r\ngreat--and not only they, but among the learned, \"even physicians and\r\nnaturalists.\" It does not seem worth while to expend sorrow and\r\nindignation upon this fact, not at all new, as we now fifty years\r\nfarther along have discovered; for we can show our physicians and\r\nnaturalists, and also our priests and prophets, in small crowds with\r\nwhom marvels find acceptance. We shall see more of them by and by.\r\n\r\nBut one among the rich and great, was the Cardinal Prince Count Rohan,\r\nArchbishop of Strasburg. \"Open-handed dupe,\" as some term him--now out\r\nof favor with the Queen Marie Antoinette (after that beheaded and called\r\nunfortunate). Banished from his beloved Paris and the sunshine of\r\nroyalty, what should he do but to regain his pedestal? necessary no\r\ndoubt, for the glory of God, and his church; necessary at least for the\r\nCount Rohan. Cagliostro is all powerful--he will help the Cardinal\r\nPrince--not only by philters and charms, but by prophecies from the\r\ngods, who speaking through their earthly oracle, will of course (it\r\npaying best), promise success and not failure. The Archbishop tries all\r\nthings, and at last the far-famed \"diamond necklace,\" upon the queen,\r\nwhich no woman's heart can withstand, not even the queen's. Sad to tell,\r\nthe miserable queen knew nothing of the necklace; and only the Md'lle De\r\nla Motte, styled countess, by superior arts had outjuggled Cagliostro\r\nhimself, Cardinal Rohan, queen and all: the diamonds were gone--the\r\nqueen's character blackened, cardinal, cophta, and countess, all in the\r\nBastille, where they lay some nine months (year 1781), disastrous\r\nmonths, when \"high science\" wasted itself in eating out its own heart.\r\nCagliostro escaped, was let go--but a plundered, banished, suspected\r\nhigh priest, was quite another thing from a golden cophta, with the\r\nforeign coat-of-arms, serene countess--and open purse relieving the\r\nunfortunate.\r\n\r\nCagliostro now flits to England, to Bale, to Brienne, to Aix, to Turin,\r\nhe wanders hither and thither; we cannot follow him. The end of all, the\r\nlofty and the low, must come--that seems drawing near to Cagliostro\r\ntoo--but how? not in ruddy splendor as of departing day, not quiet,\r\nserene, as of nature sinking to rest--rather like the disastrous death\r\nof the bleeding shark it seems: his brethren, his friends--- sharks of\r\nhis own kind, of all kinds, high and low--rush upon the wounded shark,\r\nas to a banquet to which they were bidden. He is exiled here, he is\r\npersecuted there--imprisonment, despair, degradation haunt him--the\r\nhouseless, unfortunate--now vagabond, once renovator of the human race,\r\nand friend of lords and friend of gods and princes. Such is gratitude!\r\nsuch is popular favor! a thing to be bought and bargained for, to be\r\ngiven when _not needed_. Such, no doubt, Cagliostro decided!\r\n\r\nHe is sore bested, and begins \"to confess himself to priests,\" for a man\r\nmust do something in his extremity. It avails him not; he is at last in\r\nthe gripe of the holy Inquisition at Rome, \"in the year of our Lord,\r\n1789, December 29,\" and must match himself with a power which this world\r\nknows something of: face to face, hand to hand, at last. Have they\r\njuggles equal to his juggles, miracles equal to his--high science equal\r\nto his--legions of angels equal to his?--enough that they have dungeons,\r\nand sbirri--and in his case, hearts harder than the nether\r\nmill-stone--not to be softened \"by demands for religious\r\nbooks\"--assertions of the divinity of the Egyptian Masonry--promises of\r\nwonderful revelations--oaths, flatteries, or any of the mystic\r\nparaphernalia of the now powerless professor and prophet: they will not\r\nlet him out! but rather will introduce him to a new art, that of\r\nbecoming a Christian, and get him, the toughest in a tough time, into\r\nheaven as they best can. Did they find Loyola's twenty days sufficient,\r\nand was the article then turned out of hand complete for that other\r\nstate? The Inquisition biographer does not dwell upon this, it was\r\nperhaps as well. We learn at last that he died in the year 1795, and\r\nwent, the writer says, \"_Whither_ no man knows!\" So ended a Magician!\r\n\r\nNEW HAVEN, Feb., 1852.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] T.

W. H. STILES.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cabinet remained in deliberation at the Ministry of War, situated at\r\nthe corner of the square called the Hof. The tide of insurrection now\r\nrose to an unconquerable height. The nearest shots of the retiring\r\ncannons, the advancing shouts of the infuriated people, warned the\r\nministers that all defence was rapidly becoming hopeless. The building\r\nitself still offered some means of resistance, and there were two\r\ncannons in the court; but at that crisis was issued a written order,\r\nsigned by Latour and Wessenberg, \"to cease the fire at all points,\" and\r\ngiven to officers for distribution.[3] It was in vain. The popular\r\ntorrent rolled on toward the seat of government, which was destined ere\r\nlong to be disgraced by atrocious crime. The minister of war, Count\r\nLatour, prepared for defence. The military on guard in front of the war\r\noffice were withdrawn into the yards, with two pieces of artillery\r\nloaded with grape. The gates were closed, the military distributed to\r\nthe different threatened points, and the cannons directed towards the\r\ntwo gates; soon the scene of battle had reached the Bogner Gasse,\r\nimmediately under the windows of the war department; the ministers in\r\nconsultation heard the cry, \"The military retreat.\" The great square of\r\nthe Hof was soon cleared, the soldiers retiring by the way of the\r\nFreyung. The guards and academic legion pursuing; the military\r\ncommander's quarters in the Freyung are soon captured. The retiring\r\nmilitary not being able to escape through the Schotten-Thor, as they had\r\nexpected, that gate being closed and barricaded, they cut their way\r\nthrough the Herrn Gasse.\r\n\r\nSo intent were the respective combatants, either in retreat or pursuit,\r\nthat the whole tempest of war swept over the Hof, and left that square,\r\nfor a short time, deserted and silent.\r\n\r\nBut that stillness was but of short duration; a few moments only had\r\nelapsed, when a number of straggling guards, students, and people, came\r\nstealing silently from the Graben, through the Bogner, Naglus, and\r\nGlosken Gasse, on to the Hof, and removed the dead and the wounded into\r\nthe neighboring dwellings, and into the deserted guard-house in the war\r\ndepartment. These were soon followed by a fierce and noisy mob, armed\r\nwith axes, pikes, and iron bars, which halted before the war office, and\r\nbegan to thunder at its massive doors.\r\n\r\nThe officer of ordnance in vain attempted to communicate to the crowd\r\nthe order of the ministry, that all firing should cease. A member of the\r\nacademic legion, from the window, over the gateway, waved with a white\r\nhandkerchief to the tumultuous masses, and, exhibiting the order signed\r\nby Latour and Wessenberg, read its contents to the crowd.\r\n\r\nBut a pacification was not to be thought of; the people were too\r\nexcited, their fury could only be appeased by blood; that delayed\r\nmeasure was not sufficient; they made negative gesticulations, and\r\nsummoned the student to come down and open the portals to their\r\nadmission. The tumult increased from minute to minute; the closed doors\r\nat length gave way under the axes of the mob, and the people streamed\r\nin, led by a man \"in a light gray coat.\"\r\n\r\nThe secretary of war, having by this time abandoned the idea of defence,\r\non the ground either that it was useless or impolitic, no shots were\r\nfired or active resistance offered; but the orderlies with their horses\r\nretired to the stables, and the grenadiers into an inner court. At first\r\nonly single individuals entered, and their course was not characterized\r\nby violence; then groups, proceeding slowly, listening, and searching;\r\nand, at last the tumultuous masses thundered in the rear.\r\n\r\nEre long the cry rung on the broad staircase, \"Where is Latour? he must\r\ndie!\" At this moment the ministers and their followers in the building,\r\nwith the exception of Latour himself, found means to escape, or mingled\r\nwith the throng. The deputies, Smolka, Borrosch, Goldmark, and\r\nSierakowski, who had undertaken to guarantee protection to the\r\nthreatened ministers, arrived in the hope of restraining the mob. The\r\nnumerous corridors and cabinets of the war office (formerly a monastery\r\nof the Jesuits) were filled with the crowd; the tide of insurrection now\r\nrose to an uncontrollable height; and the danger of Latour became every\r\nmoment more imminent.\r\n\r\nThe generals who were with him, perceiving the peril, entreated him to\r\nthrow himself upon the Nassau regiment or the Dutch Meister grenadiers,\r\nand retreat to their barracks. He scorned the proposal, denied the\r\ndanger, and even refused, for some time, to change his uniform for a\r\ncivilian's dress, until the hazard becoming more evident, he put on\r\nplain clothes, and went up into a small room in the roof of the\r\nbuilding, where he soon after signed a paper declaring that, with his\r\nmajesty's consent, he was ready to resign the office of minister of war.\r\nA Tecnicker, named Ranch,[4] who, it was said, had come to relieve the\r\nsecretary of war, was seized and hung in the court by his own scarf, but\r\nfortunately cut down by a National Guard before life was extinct. The\r\nmob rushed into the private apartment of the minister, but plundered it\r\nmerely of the papers, which were conveyed to the university. They came\r\nwith a sterner purpose. The act of resignation, exhibited to the crowd\r\nby the deputy Smolka, was scornfully received by the people, while the\r\nfreshness of the writing, the sand adhering still to the ink, betrayed\r\nthe proximity of the hand which had just traced it. Meanwhile, the crowd\r\nhad penetrated the corridors of the fourth story, and were not long in\r\ndiscovering the place of Latour's concealment. Hearing their approach,\r\nand recognizing the voice of Smolka, vice-president of the assembly, who\r\nwas doubtless anxious to protect him, Latour came out of his retreat.\r\n\r\nThey descended together from the fourth story by a narrow stairway, on\r\nthe right-hand side of the building, and entered the yard by the pump.\r\nAt each successive landing place, the tumult and the crowd increased;\r\nbut the descent was slow, and rendered more and more difficult by the\r\nnumbers which joined the crowd at every turn of the stairs. At length\r\nthey reached the court below, and Count Latour, although he had been\r\nseverely pressed, was still unhurt; but here the populace, which awaited\r\nthem, broke in upon the group that still clustered around Latour, and\r\ndispersed it. In vain did the deputies, Smolka and Sierakowski, endeavor\r\nto protect the minister; in vain did the Count Leopold Gondrecourt\r\nattempt to cover him by the exposure of his own body. A workman struck\r\nthe hat from his head; others pulled him by his gray locks, he defending\r\nhimself with his hands, which were already bleeding. At length a\r\nruffian, disguised as a Magyar, gave him, from behind, a mortal blow\r\nwith a hammer, the man in the gray coat cleft his face with a sabre, and\r\nanother plunged a bayonet into his heart. A hundred wounds followed,\r\nand, with the words, \"I die innocent!\" he gave up his loyal and manly\r\nspirit. A cry of exultation from the assembled crowd rent the air at\r\nthis event. Every indignity was offered to his body; before he had\r\nceased to breathe even, they hung him by a cord to the grating of a\r\nwindow in the court of the war office. He had been suspended there but a\r\nfew minutes when, from the outrages committed on it, the body fell.\r\n\r\nThey then dragged it to the Hof, and suspended it to one of the bronze\r\ncandelabras that adorn that extensive, and much frequented square, and\r\nthere treated it with every indignity; it remained for fourteen hours\r\nexposed to the gaze of a mocking populace.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] A chapter from Mr. Stiles's forthcoming work on Austria, which we\r\nhave mentioned elsewhere in this number of the International.\r\n\r\n[3] The last order issued by the unfortunate Latour was instructed to\r\nColonel Gustave Schindler, of the imperial engineers, an efficient\r\nofficer, as well as a most amiable and accomplished gentleman, and one\r\nwell and favourably known in the United States, from his kind attention\r\nto Americans who have visited the Austrian capital. The colonel was in\r\nthe act of passing out of the great door of the war office, which opens\r\non the Hof, when the mob reached that spot. Recognized by his imperial\r\nuniform, he was instantly surrounded and attacked. He received many\r\nblows on the head, inflicted by the crowd with clubs and iron bars; was\r\nmost severely wounded, and would probably have been killed but for the\r\ntimely interference of one of the rabble, who, riding up on horseback\r\nbetween the colonel and the mob, shielded him from further blow, and\r\nfinally effected his escape.\r\n\r\n[4] A student of the Polytechnic school, for brevity, usually called\r\nTecnickers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME SMALL POEMS.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE,\r\n\r\nBY R.

In Great\r\nBritain, where he was well known and highly esteemed by literary men,\r\nthere have been many feeling and apparently just tributes to his memory,\r\none of the most interesting of which is a memoir in the _Dublin\r\nUniversity Magazine_, from which we transcribe the following paragraphs:\r\n\r\n     \"It was during an extended tour in the Mediterranean about\r\n     ten years ago, that Mr. Warburton sent some sheets of\r\n     manuscript notes to Mr. Lever, at that time Editor of the\r\n     _Dublin University Magazine_. These at once caught that\r\n     gentleman's attention, and he gladly gave them publicity,\r\n     under the title of \"Episodes of Eastern Travel,\" in\r\n     successive numbers of the magazine, where they were\r\n     universally admired for the grace and liveliness of their\r\n     style. Mr. Lever, however, soon saw that though for the\r\n     purposes of his periodical these papers were extremely\r\n     valuable, the author was not consulting his own best\r\n     interests by continuing to give his travels to the world in\r\n     that form; and, with generous disinterestedness, advised him\r\n     to collect what he had already published, and the remainder\r\n     of his notes, and make a book of the whole. Mr. Warburton\r\n     followed his advice, entered into terms with Mr. Colburn,\r\n     and published his travels under the title of 'The Crescent\r\n     and the Cross.'\r\n\r\n     \"Of this book it is needless for us to speak. In spite of\r\n     the formidable rivalry of an 'Eothen,' which appeared about\r\n     the same time, it sprang at once into public favor, and is\r\n     one of the very few books of modern travels of which the\r\n     sale has continued uninterrupted through successive editions\r\n     to the present time. Were we to pronounce upon the secret of\r\n     its success, we should lay it to its perfect\r\n     _right-mindedness_. A changeful truth, a versatile propriety\r\n     of feeling initiates the author, as it were, into the heart\r\n     of each successive subject; and we find him as profoundly\r\n     impressed with the genius of the Holy Land, as he is\r\n     steeped, in the proper place, in the slumberous influences\r\n     of the dreamy Nile, upon whose bosom he rocks his readers\r\n     into a trance, to be awakened only by the gladsome\r\n     originality of these melodies which come mirthfully on their\r\n     ears from either bank. And, we may observe in passing, it is\r\n     precisely the _want_ of this, which prevents the\r\n     indisputable power and grace of 'Eothen' from having their\r\n     full effect with the public.\r\n\r\n     \"Passages of beauty, almost of sublimity, stand isolated\r\n     from our sympathies by the interposed cynicism of a few\r\n     caustic remarks; and scenes of the world's most ancient\r\n     reverence and worship become needlessly disenchanted under\r\n     the spell of some skeptical sneer.\r\n\r\n     \"But we must not turn aside to criticise. Since the\r\n     publication of the 'Crescent and the Cross,' Mr. Warburton\r\n     has written, or edited, a number of works, some historical,\r\n     others of fiction, of which his last romance, 'Darien,' only\r\n     appeared as he was on the eve of departing on the fatal\r\n     voyage. It has been remarked as a singular circumstance,\r\n     that in this tale has prefigured his own fate. A burning\r\n     ship is described in terms which would have served as a\r\n     picture of the frightful reality he was himself doomed to\r\n     witness. The coincidence, casual as it is, has imparted a\r\n     melancholy interest to that story, which will long be wept\r\n     over as the parting and presaging legacy of a gifted spirit,\r\n     prematurely snatched away.\r\n\r\n     \"These lighter effusions most probably grew out of the\r\n     craving of the publishers for the _prestige_ of his name,\r\n     already found to be valuable even on title-pages; and the\r\n     ready market they commanded could not but prove an\r\n     excitement to continue and multiply them. This might be\r\n     considered in an ulterior sense unfortunate; for we are\r\n     inclined to think that the true bent of Mr. Warburton's\r\n     mind, if not of his talents, was towards graver and less\r\n     imaginative studies; and we know that this propensity was\r\n     growing upon him with maturer years and soberer reflections.\r\n\r\n     \"It is not exclusively from the bearing of his researches\r\n     and the general drift of his correspondence that we infer\r\n     this; though both set latterly in that direction. He had for\r\n     some time been actually at work with definite objects in\r\n     view. One subject which he took up warmly was a _British_\r\n     History of Ireland; that is, a history intended to deal\r\n     impartial justice between the Irish people on the one side,\r\n     and the British empire on the other; reviewing the politics\r\n     of successive periods, neither from the Irish nor the\r\n     English side of the question, but with reference to the\r\n     general interests of the whole.\r\n\r\n     \"The task, would have proved an arduous one, under any\r\n     circumstances--perhaps an invidious one; but what was worse,\r\n     even when accomplished, the book might have turned out a\r\n     dull affair. So, with a view to lightening the reading, he\r\n     had proposed to embody with it memoirs of the Viceroys, thus\r\n     keeping the British connection prominent, while enlivening\r\n     the pages with biographical touches.\r\n\r\n     \"Acting on these ideas, he had actually begun a 'History of\r\n     the Viceroys' in conjunction with a literary friend, and was\r\n     only deterred from prosecuting it by the apathy, or rather\r\n     discouragement, of the London publishers, who felt no\r\n     inclination to venture upon an Irish historical speculation.\r\n     Unfortunately, neither he nor his friend could afford to\r\n     pursue the task gratuitously, and it was accordingly\r\n     abandoned.\r\n\r\n     \"Still later, he employed himself in collecting materials\r\n     for a History of the Poor--a vast theme; perhaps too vast\r\n     for a single intellect to grasp. To him, however, it was a\r\n     labor of love; and he had succeeded in getting together a\r\n     considerable mass of curious and valuable material _pour\r\n     servir_. His last visit to his native country had researches\r\n     of this nature for one of its objects; and we are sure many\r\n     persons connected with the charitable institutions of\r\n     Dublin, will recollect the persevering zeal with which he\r\n     visited the haunts of poverty, as well as the asylums for\r\n     its relief, noting down every thing which might prove\r\n     afterwards serviceable on that suggestive topic.\r\n\r\n     \"With an upwelling of philanthropy so pure and perennial as\r\n     this, the preliminary investigations could have been only a\r\n     delight to him. Other men might be forced to them as a\r\n     revolting duty; he chose the inquiry, with very dubious\r\n     hopes of bettering himself by prosecuting it, because his\r\n     heart was full of compassion, and he thought he might do\r\n     good. We repeat, what we can state from personal knowledge,\r\n     that the bent of Mr. Warburton's mind was latterly towards\r\n     works of general utility; and it is with great satisfaction\r\n     we learn, what we had not been aware of until the public\r\n     papers announced it, that his projected visit to the New\r\n     World was a mission, in which the interests of humanity were\r\n     to have in him an advocate and champion.\r\n\r\n     \"Into his private life we feel that, under present\r\n     circumstances, it would be indelicate, as well as out of\r\n     place, to enter. Surrounded as he was with all the blessings\r\n     which the domestic relations can bestow, beloved by his\r\n     intimates, caressed by the gifted and the good, Eliot\r\n     Warburton lived the centre of a radiating circle of\r\n     happiness. His personal qualities were of no common order.\r\n     His society was eagerly sought after. With a fastidious\r\n     lassitude of air, and an apparent disinclination to\r\n     exertion, he possessed remarkable force of thought and\r\n     fluency of diction; and it was no uncommon thing to see him,\r\n     when he had begun to relate passages from his experience in\r\n     foreign countries, or adventures in his own, the centre of a\r\n     gradually increasing audience, amidst which he sat,\r\n     improvisating a sort of romantic recitation, until he was\r\n     completely carried away on the current of his own eloquence,\r\n     and lost every sense of where he was or what he was doing,\r\n     in the enthusiasm he had fanned up and saw reflected around\r\n     him. This power was a peculiar gift; and he loved to\r\n     exercise it. In this form many of his happiest effusions\r\n     have been given utterance to; and every body who has heard\r\n     him at such inspired moments has felt regret that the\r\n     brilliant bursts which so delighted him, should have been\r\n     stamped upon no more retentive tablets than the ears of\r\n     ordinary listeners.\r\n\r\n     \"Of this amiable, refined and gifted individual, we are\r\n     afraid to speak as warmly as our heart would dictate. Before\r\n     us lie the few hasty lines--but not too hurried to be the\r\n     channel of a parting kindness--scrawled to us on the first\r\n     day of this year--the last day the writer was ever to pass\r\n     in England. They are, perhaps, amongst the latest words he\r\n     ever wrote. 'I am off,' they run 'for the West Indies\r\n     to-morrow. _But I have accomplished your affair._' Oh,\r\n     vanity of human purpose! Man proposes--God disposes. We were\r\n     next to hear of him, standing on the deck of the burning\r\n     vessel in the Atlantic, alone with the captain, after every\r\n     other soul had disappeared, surveying--we feel convinced,\r\n     with a courage of a lion--the awful twofold death close\r\n     before him, and which he had in probability deliberately\r\n     preferred to an early relinquishment of his companions to\r\n     their fate. It is a fine picture--one that shall every hang\r\n     framed with his image in our memory; helping us to believe\r\n     that\r\n\r\n    \"'-----Lycidas our sorrow is not dead.\r\n    Sunk though he be beneath the watery flood,'--\r\n\r\n     But that he hath mounted to a higher sphere--\r\n\r\n    \"'Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR OF \"THE FOOL OF QUALITY.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the interesting papers in the February Dublin University Magazine, we\r\nhave read none with more satisfaction than the biographical sketch and\r\nportrait of one of the most distinguished Irishmen of his own or any\r\nage, the gifted and pure minded author of _Gustavus Vasa_ and _The Fool\r\nof Quality_, HENRY BROOKE. Of his literary fate it might be said that\r\nthe most unfortunate thing he did was to assert the patriotism of Dean\r\nSwift; and the most unfortunate thing was to be left out of Doctor\r\nJohnson's \"Lives of the Poets.\" Trials had he to undergo, although not\r\nabsolutely driven to the wall, like many children of \"the fatal dowry,\"\r\nand those of Irish complexion, in particular; but he bravely bore up\r\nagainst them. Those who deem that relatives may live more happily apart,\r\nand that friendship is best preserved in full dress, may look at the\r\npicture of Henry Brooke, the poet and politician, and Robert Brooke, the\r\npainter, with their wives and children, not less than twenty, living\r\ntogether in perfect peace and amity at Daisy Park, in the flattest part\r\nof Kildare, where, in those dull seats and distant times, a family\r\nbreeze might now and then have been looked on in the Irish sense as a\r\n\"convenience and a comfort.\" \"While Henry wrote,\" says the biographer,\r\n\"Robert painted, and sold his pictures; and thus these two loving\r\nbrothers, having lost their property, made a right and manful use of\r\ntheir intellectual gifts, and supported their large families by the\r\nsweat of their brows.\"\r\n\r\n     \"In his politics, Brooke was of the old whig school; and,\r\n     had he lived in 1829, he would probably have been an\r\n     emancipator. He was a right-minded, ardent Irishman in his\r\n     love for fatherland; hated oppression; idolized liberty;\r\n     wrote most keenly against Poyning's infamous laws; mourned\r\n     over the misrule and misgovernment of his country, under the\r\n     tyranny and rapacity of the Stuart dynasty; admired King\r\n     William, and was an exulting Protestant; yet greatly loved\r\n     his Roman Catholic neighbors, and would preserve to them\r\n     their properties, though he disliked their principles, and\r\n     deprecated their ascendency.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Johnson's feelings respecting Brooke are accounted for, not\r\nimprobably, as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"It may be asked why did Dr. Johnson exclude Brooke from his\r\n     'Lives of the Poets,' where so many names of little note are\r\n     to be found? In 1739, Johnson had written in Brooke's praise\r\n     in his 'Complete Vindication,' and twenty years afterwards,\r\n     when the learned Dr. Campbell showed a spirited 'Prospectus\r\n     of a History of Ireland' written by him, to the great\r\n     moralist, he read it with much pleasure and praise, saying\r\n     that 'every line breathed the true fire of genius.' It is\r\n     recorded that, on this occasion, Johnson lamented that 'the\r\n     vanity of Irishmen, even if their patriotism were extinct,\r\n     did not enable Brooke to carry his design into execution.'\r\n     In Johnson's letter to Charles O'Connor we have his mind on\r\n     the subject. To Brooke he appears never to have written;\r\n     there had been an ancient quarrel between them. They had\r\n     argued and disagreed; and the traditionary story in Brooke's\r\n     family bears _so_ heavily on the manner of the philosopher,\r\n     and is _so_ flattering to the courtesy of the poet, that we\r\n     should prefer not to write it down. Brooke was at all times\r\n     strangely careless of fame; independent to a fault, and more\r\n     proud than vain; and though much urged by his friends to\r\n     humble himself, yet he could not be induced to 'bow down' to\r\n     the cap of this literary Gesler, much as he regarded his\r\n     learning and noble intellect. This dislike of the Doctor\r\n     continued during his life; and Boswell narrates that on the\r\n     occasion of a play being read to him (it was Brooke's\r\n     _Gustavus Vasa_) and a circle of friends, on coming to the\r\n     line--\r\n\r\n    \"Who rules o'er free men should himself be free!'\r\n\r\n     the company applauded, but Johnson said it might as well be\r\n     said--\r\n\r\n    \"'Who drives fat oxen should himself be fat--'\r\n\r\n     a stupid and inapt verbal sophism, and unworthy of his great\r\n     and good mind; but such was often his way. In this fashion\r\n     one might string endless parodies on the line, and equally\r\n     inapplicable; for example:--\r\n\r\n    \"'Who keeps a madhouse should himself be mad!'\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Brooke's elegant and honest mind probably had in view\r\n     that word of Scripture which saith, 'he that ruleth his own\r\n     spirit is better than he who taketh a city'--(Prov. xvi.\r\n     32.)\r\n\r\n\"By this unhappy difference Brooke lost his Johnsonian niche in the\r\ntemple of biographical fame. Yet we must remember that a better fate was\r\nhis,--'his record is on high,'--and his spirit with that Saviour who\r\nloved him and made him what he was. Faults and inconsistency were in\r\nhim, no doubt, but still we know not of any of whom it could be so well\r\nand suitably said--\r\n\r\n    \"'His life was gentle, and the elements\r\n    So mixed him, that Nature might stand up\r\n    And say to all the world, 'This was a man.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBANCROFT'S AMERICAN REVOLUTION.[5]\r\n\r\nFrom the Westminster Review.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the historians who have attained a high and deserved reputation in\r\nthe United States, within the last few years, we are inclined to yield\r\nthe first place to George Bancroft. His great work on the history of the\r\nUnited States has been brought down from the commencement of American\r\ncolonization to the opening of the Revolutionary War, to which subject\r\nit is understood that he intends devoting the three succeeding volumes.\r\nHis researches in the public offices of England, while he was Minister\r\nof the United States at the Court of St. James, have brought to light a\r\ngreat mass of documentary evidence on the antecedents and course of the\r\nRevolution, which have not yet been made public. With his critical\r\nsagacity in sifting evidence, his hound-like instinct in scenting every\r\nparticle of testimony that can lead him on the right-track, and his\r\nplastic skill in moulding the most confused and discordant materials\r\ninto a compact, symmetrical, and truthful narrative, he cannot fail to\r\npresent the story of that great historical drama with a freshness,\r\naccuracy, and artistic beauty, worthy of the immortal events which it\r\ncommemorates. Mr. Bancroft is now exclusively occupied in the\r\ncompletion of this work. He pursues it with the drudging fidelity of a\r\nmechanical laborer, combined with the enthusiasm of a poet and the\r\ncomprehensive wisdom of a statesman. With strong social tastes, he gives\r\nlittle time to society. His favorite post is in his library, where he\r\nlabors the live-long day in the spirit of the ancient artist, _Nulla\r\ndies sine linea_. His experience in political and diplomatic life, no\r\nless than his rare and generous culture, and his singular union of the\r\nhighest mental faculties, enable us to predict with confidence that this\r\nwork will be reckoned among the genuine masterpieces of historical\r\ngenius. The volumes of the History of the United States already\r\npublished, are well known to intelligent readers both in Great Britain\r\nand America. They are distinguished for their compact brevity of\r\nstatement, their terse and vigorous diction, their brilliant panoramic\r\nviews, and the boldness and grace of their sketches of personal\r\ncharacter. A still higher praise may be awarded to this history for the\r\ntenacity with which it clings to the dominant and inspiring idea of\r\nwhich it records the development. Whoever reads it without comprehending\r\nthe standpoint of the author, is liable to disappointment. For it must\r\nbe confessed that as a mere narrative of events, the preference may be\r\ngiven to the productions of far inferior authors. But it is to be\r\nregarded as an epic in prose of the triumph of freedom. This noble\r\nprinciple is considered by Mr. Bancroft as an essential attribute of the\r\nsoul, necessarily asserting itself in proportion to the spiritual\r\nsupremacy which has been achieved. The history, then, is devoted to the\r\nillustration of the progress of freedom, as an out-birth of the\r\nspontaneous action of the soul. It is in this point of view that the\r\nremarkable chapters on the Massachusetts Pilgrims, the Pennsylvania\r\nQuakers, and the North American Indians, were written; and their full\r\npurport, their profound significance, can only be appreciated by readers\r\nwhose minds possess at least the seeds of sympathy and cognateness with\r\nthis sublime philosophy. The chapter on the Quakers is a pregnant\r\npsychological treatise. Sparkling all over with the electric lights of a\r\nrich humanitary philosophy, it invests the theologic visions of Fox and\r\nBarclay with a radiance and beauty which have been ill-preserved in the\r\nformal and lifeless organic systems of their successors. The parallel\r\nrun by the historian between William Penn and John Locke is one of the\r\nmost characteristic productions of his peculiar genius. Original,\r\nsubtle, suggestive, crowded with matter and frugal of words, it brings\r\nout the distinctive features of the spiritual and mechanical schools in\r\nthe persons of two of their 'representative men,' with a breadth and\r\nreality which is seldom found in philosophical portraitures. Mr.\r\nBancroft was the son of an eminent Unitarian clergyman in Worcester,\r\nMassachusetts. He was born about the beginning of the present century,\r\nand is consequently a little more than fifty years of age. He graduated\r\nat Harvard University, with distinguished honors, before he had\r\ncompleted his fifteenth year. Soon after he sailed for Europe, and\r\ncontinued his studies at the German Universities, returning to his own\r\ncountry just before the attainment of his majority. Devoting himself for\r\nseveral years to literary and educational pursuits, he acquired a\r\nbrilliant reputation as a poet, critic, and essayist; and at a\r\nsubsequent period, entering the career of politics, he has signalized\r\nhimself by his attachment to democratic ideas, and the eloquence and\r\nforce with which on all occasions he has sustained the principles with\r\nthe prevalence of which he identifies the progress of humanity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the Athenaeum.\r\n\r\nThe further this work proceeds, the more do we feel that it must take\r\nits place as an essentially satisfactory history of the United States.\r\nMr. Bancroft is thoroughly American in thought and in feeling, without\r\nceasing to have those larger views and nobler sympathies which result\r\nfrom cosmopolitan rather than from local training. His style is original\r\nand national. It breathes of the mountain and the prairie--of the great\r\nlakes and wild savannahs of his native land. A strain of wild and\r\nforest-like music swells up in almost every line. The story is told\r\nrichly and vividly. It has hitherto been thought by Americans\r\nthemselves, even more than by Europeans, that the story of the English\r\ncolonies presented but a dreary and lifeless succession of petty\r\nsquabbles between the settlers and the crown officers--of unintelligible\r\npersecutions of each other on the ground of differences of opinion in\r\nreligion. Mr. Bancroft has shown how ill founded has been this\r\nimpression. In his hands American history is full of fine effects.\r\nSteeped in the colors of his imagination, a thousand incidents hitherto\r\nthought dull appear animated and pictorial. Between Hildreth and\r\nBancroft the difference is immense. In the treatment of the former,\r\ndates, facts, events are duly stated--the criticism is keen, the\r\nchronology indisputable,--but the figures do not live, the narrative\r\nknows no march. The latter is all movement. His men glow with human\r\npurposes,--his story sweeps on with the exulting life of a procession.\r\n\r\nYet because Mr. Bancroft contrives to bring out the more romantic\r\naspects of his theme, it is not to be supposed that he fails in that\r\nstrict regard to truth--truth of character as well as of incident--which\r\nis the historian's first duty, and without which all other qualities are\r\nuseless. Of all American writers who have written on the history of\r\ntheir own country, we would pronounce him to be the most conscientious.\r\nHis former volumes were remarkable for the amplitude and accuracy of\r\ntheir references. The authorities cited were often recondite and\r\nobscure,--yet it was evident that they had been sifted carefully and\r\ncritically. The same may be said of the volume before us.\r\n\r\nCareful research had enabled Mr. Bancroft to throw new light on several\r\npoints connected with the settlement and early history of his country.\r\nAs his dates approach nearer to the present time, the sources of new\r\ninformation open on him in abundance. The MS, additions to our knowledge\r\nof the times treated of in these volumes are considerable; but they are\r\nspread pretty fairly over the entire narrative--lending a new light to\r\nthe events and adding a new trait to the characters--rather than thrown\r\ninto masses. The effect produced is more that of greater roundness and\r\ncompletion than of absolute change in old historical verdicts. We quote\r\none out of innumerable instances of these minute but characteristic\r\nadditions. The historian is speaking of the Duke of Newcastle,--whose\r\nignorant government of the colonies was one of the chief sources of\r\ntheir discontent:--\r\n\r\n     \"For nearly four-and-twenty years he remained minister for\r\n     British America; yet to the last, the statesman, who was\r\n     deeply versed in the statistics of elections, knew little of\r\n     the continent of which he was the guardian. He addressed\r\n     letters, it used to be confidently said, to 'the island of\r\n     New England,' and could not tell but that Jamaica was in the\r\n     Mediterranean. Heaps of colonial memorials and letters\r\n     remained unread in his office; and a paper was almost sure\r\n     of neglect unless some agent remained with him to see it\r\n     opened. His frivolous nature could never glow with\r\n     affection, or grasp a great idea, or analyze complex\r\n     relations. After long research, I cannot find that he ever\r\n     once attended seriously to an American question, or had a\r\n     clear conception of one American measure.\"\r\n\r\nWalpole had told us that Newcastle did not know where Jamaica was:--the\r\namusing address \"Island of New England\" Mr. Bancroft finds referred to\r\nin a manuscript letter of J. Q. Adams. It serves to suggest that what is\r\nusually thought to be a joke of Walpole's was probably the literal\r\ntruth:--the man who is sufficiently innocent of geography to make New\r\nEngland an island, would have no difficulty in confounding the East and\r\nWest Indies.\r\n\r\nIn this volume we first meet with the great character who is to be the\r\nhero of the Revolution now looming before the reader. Mr. Bancroft\r\ntreats us to no full-length portrait of George Washington:--instead of a\r\npicture he presents us with the man. Washington comes before us at\r\ntwenty-one,--in the chamber of Governor Dinwiddie, of Virginia; from\r\nwhom he is accepting a perilous but most important mission--to cross the\r\nforests, rivers, and mountains which separate Williamsburg and Lake\r\nErie, in the depths of a severe winter, and there endeavor to detach the\r\nDelaware Indians from the French alliance. All the elements of\r\nWashington's greatness--his courage, hardihood, military prescience, and\r\nmerciful disposition--are stamped indelibly on this the first act of his\r\npublic life:--\r\n\r\n     \"In the middle of November, with an interpreter and four\r\n     attendants, and Christopher Gist as a guide, he left Will's\r\n     Creek, and following the Indian trace through forest\r\n     solitudes, gloomy with the fallen leaves, and solemn sadness\r\n     of late autumn, across mountains, rocky ravines, and\r\n     streams, through sleet and snows, he rode in nine days to\r\n     the fork of the Ohio. How lonely was the spot, where, so\r\n     long unheeded of men, the rapid Allegheny met nearly at\r\n     right angles 'the deep and still' water of the Monongahela!\r\n     At once Washington foresaw the destiny of the place. 'I\r\n     spent some time,' said he, 'in viewing the rivers;' 'the\r\n     land in the Fork has the absolute command of both.' 'The\r\n     flat, well-timbered land all around the point lies very\r\n     convenient for building.' After creating in imagination a\r\n     fortress and a city, he and his party swam their horses\r\n     across the Allegheny, and wrapt their blankets around them\r\n     for the night, on its northwest bank. From the Fork the\r\n     chief of the Delawares conducted Washington through rich\r\n     alluvial fields to the pleasing valley at Logstown. There\r\n     deserters from Louisiana discoursed of the route from New\r\n     Orleans to Quebec, by way of the Wabash and the Maumee, and\r\n     of a detachment from the lower province on its way to meet\r\n     the French troops from Lake Erie, while Washington held\r\n     close colloquy with the half-king; the one anxious to gain\r\n     the west as a part of the territory of the ancient dominion,\r\n     the other to preserve it for the Red Men. 'We are brothers,'\r\n     said the half-king in council; 'we are one people; I will\r\n     send back the French speech-belt, and will make the Shawnees\r\n     and the Delawares do the same.' On the night of the\r\n     twenty-ninth of November, the council-fire was kindled an\r\n     aged orator was selected to address the French the speech\r\n     which he was to deliver was debated and rehearsed; it was\r\n     agreed that, unless the French would heed this third warning\r\n     to quit the land, the Delawares also would be their enemies;\r\n     and a very large string of black and white wampun was sent\r\n     to the Six Nations as a prayer for aid. After these\r\n     preparations, the party of Washington, attended by the\r\n     half-king, and envoys of the Delawares, moved onwards to the\r\n     post of the French at Venango. The officers there avowed the\r\n     purpose of taking possession of the Ohio; and they mingled\r\n     the praises of La Salle with boasts of their forts at Le\r\n     Boeuf and Erie, at Niagara, Toronto, and Frontenac. 'The\r\n     English,' said they, 'can raise two men to our one; but they\r\n     are too dilatory to prevent any enterprise of ours.' The\r\n     Delawares were intimidated or debauched; but the half-king\r\n     clung to Washington like a brother, and delivered up his\r\n     belt as he had promised. The rains of December had swollen\r\n     the creeks. The messengers could pass them only by felling\r\n     trees for bridges. Thus they proceeded, now killing a buck\r\n     and now a bear, delayed by excessive rains and snows, by\r\n     mire and swamps, while Washington's quick eye discerned all\r\n     the richness of the meadows. At Waterford, the limit of his\r\n     journey, he found Fort Le Boeuf defended by cannon. Around\r\n     it stood the barracks of the soldiers, rude log-cabins,\r\n     roofed with bark. Fifty birch-bark canoes, and one hundred\r\n     seventy boats of pine, were already prepared for the descent\r\n     of the river, and materials were collected for building\r\n     more. The Commander, Gardeur de St. Pierre, an officer of\r\n     integrity and experience, and, for his dauntless courage,\r\n     both feared and beloved by the Red Men, refused to discuss\r\n     questions of right. 'I am here,' said he, 'by the orders of\r\n     my general, to which I shall conform with exactness and\r\n     resolution.' And he avowed his purpose of seizing every\r\n     Englishman within the Ohio Valley. France was resolved on\r\n     possessing the great territory which her missionaries and\r\n     travellers had revealed to the world. Breaking away from\r\n     courtesies, Washington hastened homewards to Virginia. The\r\n     rapid current of French Creek dashed his party against\r\n     rocks; in shallow places they waded, the water congealing on\r\n     their clothes; where the ice had lodged in the bend of the\r\n     rivers, they carried their canoe across the neck. At\r\n     Venango, they found their horses, but so weak, the\r\n     travellers went still on foot, heedless of the storm. The\r\n     cold increased very fast; the paths grew 'worse by a deep\r\n     snow continually freezing.' Impatient to get back with his\r\n     despatches, the young envoy, wrapping himself in an Indian\r\n     dress, with gun in hand and pack on his back, the day after\r\n     Christmas quitted the usual path, and, with Gist for his\r\n     sole companion, by aid of the compass, steered the nearest\r\n     way across the country for the Fork. An Indian, who had lain\r\n     in wait for him, fired at him from not fifteen steps'\r\n     distance, but, missing him, became his prisoner. 'I would\r\n     have killed him,' wrote Gist, 'but Washington forbade.'\r\n     Dismissing their captive at night, they walked about half a\r\n     mile, then kindled a fire, fixed their course by the\r\n     compass, and continued travelling all night, and all the\r\n     next day, till quite dark. Not till then did the weary\r\n     wanderers 'think themselves safe enough to sleep,' and they\r\n     encamped, with no shelter but the leafless forest-tree. On\r\n     reaching the Allegheny, with one poor hatchet and a whole\r\n     day's work, a raft was constructed and launched. But before\r\n     they were half over the river, they were caught in the\r\n     running ice, expecting every moment to be crushed, unable to\r\n     reach either shore. Putting out the setting-pole to stop the\r\n     raft, Washington was jerked into the deep water, and saved\r\n     himself only by grasping at the raft-logs. They were obliged\r\n     to make for an island. There lay Washington, imprisoned by\r\n     the elements; but the late December night was intensely\r\n     cold, and in the morning he found the river frozen. Not till\r\n     he reached Gist's settlement, in January, 1754, were his\r\n     toils lightened.\"\r\n\r\nWashington reported the state of affairs on the Lakes,--and active\r\nmeasures were consequently adopted. Of the rapid and brilliant\r\ndevelopment of his military genius, we are not now to trace the\r\nprogress; but it is scarcely possible to read without a shudder of \"the\r\nhair-breadth 'scapes\" of the young man whose life was of such\r\ninestimable consequence to his country. Thus, in the battle fought by\r\nBraddock--to whom Washington acted as aide-de-camp--against the French\r\nand Indians in 1755, he appeared to others as well as to himself to bear\r\na charmed life. In this action, says Mr. Bancroft,--\r\n\r\n     \"Of eighty-six officers, twenty-six were killed--among them,\r\n     Sir Peter Halket,--and thirty-seven were wounded, including\r\n     Gage and other field officers. Of the men, one half were\r\n     killed or wounded. Braddock braved every danger. His\r\n     secretary was shot dead; both his English aids were disabled\r\n     early in the engagement, leaving the American alone to\r\n     distribute his orders. 'I expected every moment,' said one\r\n     whose eye was on Washington, 'to see him fall.' Nothing but\r\n     the superintending care of Providence could have saved him.\r\n     An Indian chief--I suppose a Shawnee--singled him out with\r\n     his rifle, and bade others of his warriors do the same. Two\r\n     horses were killed under him; four balls penetrated his\r\n     coat. 'Some potent Manitou guards his life,' exclaimed the\r\n     savage. 'Death,' wrote Washington, 'was levelling my\r\n     companions on every side of me, but, by the all-powerful\r\n     dispensations of Providence, I have been protected.' 'To the\r\n     public,' said Davis, a learned divine, in the following\r\n     month, 'I point out that heroic youth, Colonel Washington,\r\n     whom I cannot but hope Providence has preserved in so signal\r\n     a manner for some important service to his country.' 'Who is\r\n     Mr. Washington?' asked Lord Halifax, a few months later. 'I\r\n     know nothing of him,' he added, 'but that they say he\r\n     behaved in Braddock's action as bravely as if he really\r\n     loved the whistling of bullets.'\"\r\n\r\nThus opened that career of glory, moderation, and success--thus, at the\r\nperiod of nascent manhood were exhibited the marking traits of that\r\nserene and devoted character--which have placed the name of Washington\r\non the noblest and loftiest pedestal in the Temple of Fame.\r\n\r\nLeaving for a while the only figure in that scene of miserable and\r\nsavage warfare on which the mind can dwell with any degree of trust and\r\nsatisfaction, we will move to the north-east of the English settlements,\r\nand follow the story of the unhappy people of Acadia. Mr. Bancroft has\r\ndrawn a touching picture of the homely virtues and obscure happiness of\r\nthis rural population before the interference of the British officers\r\nchanged their joy into wailing, and endowed their simple annals with a\r\ndark and tragic interest:--\r\n\r\n     \"After repeated conquests and restorations, the treaty of\r\n     Utrecht conceded Acadia, or Nova Scotia, to Great Britain.\r\n     Yet the name of Annapolis, the presence of a feeble English\r\n     garrison, and the emigration of hardly five or six English\r\n     families, were nearly all that marked the supremacy of\r\n     England. The old inhabitants remained on the soil which they\r\n     had subdued, hardly conscious that they had changed their\r\n     sovereign. They still loved the language and the usages of\r\n     their forefathers, and their religion was graven upon their\r\n     souls. They promised submission to England; but such was the\r\n     love with which France had inspired them, they would not\r\n     fight against its standard or renounce its name. Though\r\n     conquered they were French neutrals. For nearly forty years\r\n     from the peace of Utrecht they had been forgotten or\r\n     neglected, and had prospered in their seclusion. No\r\n     tax-gatherer counted their folds, no magistrate dwelt in\r\n     their hamlets. The parish priests made their records and\r\n     regulated their successions. Their little disputes were\r\n     settled among themselves, with scarcely an instance of an\r\n     appeal to English authority at Annapolis. The pastures were\r\n     covered with their herds and flocks; and dikes, raised by\r\n     extraordinary efforts of social industry, shut out the\r\n     rivers and the tide from alluvial marshes of exuberant\r\n     fertility. The meadows, thus reclaimed, were covered by\r\n     richest grasses, or fields of wheat, that yielded fifty and\r\n     thirty fold at the harvest. Their houses were built in\r\n     clusters, neatly constructed and comfortably furnished, and\r\n     around them all kinds of domestic fowls abounded. With the\r\n     spinning-wheel and the loom, their women made, of flax from\r\n     their own fields, of fleeces from their own flock, coarse,\r\n     but sufficient clothing. The few foreign luxuries that were\r\n     coveted could be obtained from Annapolis or Louisburgh, in\r\n     return for furs, or wheat, or cattle. Thus were the Acadians\r\n     happy in their neutrality and in the abundance which they\r\n     drew from their native land. They formed, as it were, one\r\n     great family. Their morals were of unaffected purity. Love\r\n     was sanctified and calmed by the universal custom of early\r\n     marriages. The neighbors of the community would assist the\r\n     new couple to raise their cottage, while the wilderness\r\n     offered land. Their numbers increased, and the colony, which\r\n     had begun only as the trading station of a company, with a\r\n     monopoly of the fur trade, counted, perhaps, sixteen or\r\n     seventeen thousand inhabitants.\"\r\n\r\nThe transfer of this colony from French to English rule could not fail\r\nto be productive of some untoward results. The native priests feared the\r\nintroduction among them of heretical opinions:--the British officers\r\ntreated the people with insolent contempt. \"Their papers and records\"\r\nsays our historian, \"were taken from them\" by their new masters:--\r\n\r\n     \"Was their property demanded for the public service? 'they\r\n     were not to be bargained with for the payment.' The order\r\n     may still be read on the Council records at Halifax. They\r\n     must comply, it was written, without making any terms,\r\n     'immediately,' or 'the next courier would bring an order for\r\n     military execution upon the delinquents.' And when they\r\n     delayed in fetching firewood for their oppressors, it was\r\n     told them from the governor, 'If they do not do it in proper\r\n     time, the soldiers shall absolutely take their houses for\r\n     fuel.' The unoffending sufferers submitted meekly to the\r\n     tyranny. Under pretence of fearing that they might rise in\r\n     behalf of France, or seek shelter in Canada, or convey\r\n     provisions to the French garrisons, they were ordered to\r\n     surrender their boats and their firearms; and, conscious of\r\n     innocence, they gave up their barges and their muskets,\r\n     leaving themselves without the means of flight, and\r\n     defenceless. Further orders were afterwards given to the\r\n     English officers, if the Acadians behaved amiss to punish\r\n     them at discretion; if the troops were annoyed, to inflict\r\n     vengeance on the nearest, whether the guilty one or\r\n     not,--'taking an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.'\"\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to believe that these atrocious orders were not\r\nexecuted in the spirit in which they had been conceived. But worse\r\nremained to come:--\r\n\r\n     \"The Acadians cowered before their masters, hoping\r\n     forbearance; willing to take an oath of fealty to England;\r\n     in their single-mindedness and sincerity, refusing to pledge\r\n     themselves to bear arms against France. The English were\r\n     masters of the sea, were undisputed lords of the country,\r\n     and could exercise clemency without apprehension. Not a\r\n     whisper gave a warning of their purpose till it was ripe for\r\n     execution. But it had been 'determined upon' after the\r\n     ancient device of Oriental despotism, that the French\r\n     inhabitants of Acadia should be carried away into captivity\r\n     to other parts of the British dominions. * * France\r\n     remembered the descendants of her sons in the hour of their\r\n     affliction, and asked that they might have time to remove\r\n     from the peninsula with their effects, leaving their lands\r\n     to the English; but the answer of the British Minister\r\n     claimed them as useful subjects, and refused them the\r\n     liberty of transmigration. The inhabitants of Minas and the\r\n     adjacent country pleaded with the British officers for the\r\n     restitution of their boats and their guns, promising\r\n     fidelity, if they could but retain their liberties, and\r\n     declaring that not the want of arms, but their conscience,\r\n     should engage them not to revolt. 'The memorial,' said\r\n     Lawrence in Council, 'is highly arrogant, insidious and\r\n     insulting.' The memorialists, at his summons, came\r\n     submissively to Halifax. 'You want your canoes for carrying\r\n     provisions to the enemy,' said he to them, though he knew no\r\n     enemy was left in their vicinity. 'Guns are no part of your\r\n     goods,' he continued, 'as by the laws of England all Roman\r\n     Catholics are restrained from having arms, and are subject\r\n     to penalties if arms are found in their houses. It is not\r\n     the language of British subjects to talk of terms with the\r\n     Crown, or capitulate about their fidelity and allegiance.\r\n     What excuse can you make for your presumption in treating\r\n     this government with such indignity as to expound to them\r\n     the nature of fidelity? Manifest your obedience by\r\n     immediately taking the oaths of allegiance in the common\r\n     form before the Council.' The deputies replied that they\r\n     would do as the generality of the inhabitants should\r\n     determine; and they merely entreated leave to return home\r\n     and consult the body of their people. The next day, the\r\n     unhappy men, foreseeing the sorrows that menaced them,\r\n     offered to swear allegiance unconditionally.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was now too late. The savage purpose had been formed. That the\r\ncruelty might have no excuse, it happened that while the scheme was\r\nunder discussion letters arrived leaving no doubt that all the shores of\r\nthe Bay of Fundy were in the possession of the British. It only remained\r\nto be fixed how the exportation should be effected:--\r\n\r\n     \"To hunt them into the net was impracticable; artifice was\r\n     therefore resorted to. By a general proclamation, on one and\r\n     the same day, the scarcely conscious victims, 'both old men\r\n     and young men, as well as all the lads of ten years of age,'\r\n     were peremptorily ordered to assemble at their respective\r\n     posts. On the appointed 5th of September, they obeyed. At\r\n     Grand Pre, for example, 418 unarmed men came together. They\r\n     were marched into the church, and its avenues were closed,\r\n     when Winslow, the American commander, placed himself in\r\n     their centre, and spoke:--'You are convened together to\r\n     manifest to you His Majesty's final resolution to the\r\n     French inhabitants of this his province. Your lands, and\r\n     tenements, cattle of all kinds, and live stock of all sorts,\r\n     are forfeited to the crown, and you yourselves are to be\r\n     removed from this his province. I am, through his Majesty's\r\n     goodness, directed to allow you liberty to carry off your\r\n     money and household goods, as many as you can, without\r\n     discommoding the vessels you go in.' And he then declared\r\n     them the King's prisoners. Their wives and families shared\r\n     their lot; their sons, 527 in number, their daughters, 576;\r\n     in the whole, women and babes and old men and children all\r\n     included, 1,923 souls. The blow was sudden; they had left\r\n     home but for the morning, and they never were to return.\r\n     Their cattle were to stay unfed in the stalls, their fires\r\n     to die out on their hearths. They had for that first day\r\n     even no food for themselves or their children, and were\r\n     compelled to beg for bread. The 10th of September was the\r\n     day for the embarkation of a part of the exiles. They were\r\n     drawn up six deep, and the young men, 161 in number, were\r\n     ordered to march first on board the vessel. They could leave\r\n     their farms and cottages, the shady rocks on which they had\r\n     reclined, their herds and their garners; but nature yearned\r\n     within them, and they would not be separated from their\r\n     parents. Yet of what avail was the frenzied despair of the\r\n     unarmed youth? They had not one weapon; the bayonet drove\r\n     them to obey; and they marched slowly and heavily from the\r\n     chapel to the shore, between women and children, who\r\n     kneeling, prayed for blessings on their heads, they\r\n     themselves weeping, and praying, and singing hymns. The\r\n     seniors went next; the wives and children must wait till\r\n     other transport vessels arrived. The delay had its horrors.\r\n     The wretched people left behind were kept together near the\r\n     sea, without proper food or raiment, or shelter, till other\r\n     ships came to take them away; and December with its\r\n     appalling cold had struck the shivering, half-clad,\r\n     broken-hearted sufferers before the last of them were\r\n     removed. 'The embarkation of the inhabitants goes on but\r\n     slowly,' wrote Monckton, from Fort Cumberland, near which he\r\n     had burned three hamlets, 'the most part of the wives of the\r\n     men we have prisoners are gone off with their children, in\r\n     hopes I would not send off their husbands without them.'\r\n     Their hope was vain. Near Annapolis, a hundred heads of\r\n     families fled to the woods, and a party was detached on the\r\n     hunt to bring them in. 'Our soldiers hate them,' wrote an\r\n     officer on this occasion, 'and if they can but find a\r\n     pretext to kill them, they will.' Did a prisoner seek to\r\n     escape, he was shot down by the sentinel. Yet some fled to\r\n     Quebec; more than 3,000 had withdrawn to Miramichi and the\r\n     region south of the Ristigouche; some found rest on the\r\n     banks of the St. John's and its branches; some found a lair\r\n     in their native forests; some were charitably sheltered from\r\n     the English in the wigwams of the savages. But 7,000 of\r\n     these banished people were driven on board ships, and\r\n     scattered among the English colonies, from New Hampshire to\r\n     Georgia alone; 1,020 to South Carolina alone. They were cast\r\n     ashore without resources; hating the poor-house as a shelter\r\n     for their offspring, and abhorring the thought of selling\r\n     themselves as laborers. Households, too, were separated; the\r\n     colonial newspapers contained advertisements of members of\r\n     families seeking their companions, of sons anxious to reach\r\n     and relieve their parents, of mothers mourning for their\r\n     children. The wanderers sighed for their native country; but\r\n     to prevent their return, their villages, from Annapolis to\r\n     the isthmus, were laid waste. Their old homes were but\r\n     ruins. In the district of Minas, for instance, 250 of their\r\n     houses, and more than as many barns, were consumed. The live\r\n     stock which belonged to them, consisting of great numbers of\r\n     horned cattle, hogs, sheep, and horses, were seized as\r\n     spoils and disposed of by the English officials. A beautiful\r\n     and fertile tract of country was reduced to a solitude.\r\n     There was none left round the ashes of the cottages of the\r\n     Acadians but the faithful watch-dog, vainly seeking the\r\n     hands that fed him. Thickets of forest-trees choked their\r\n     orchards; the ocean broke over their neglected dikes, and\r\n     desolated their meadows.\"\r\n\r\nNor were the woes of this ill-treated people ended:\r\n\r\n     \"Relentless misfortune pursued the exiles whereever they\r\n     fled. Those sent to Georgia, drawn by a love for the spot\r\n     where they were born as strong as that of the captive Jews,\r\n     who wept by the side of the rivers of Babylon for their own\r\n     temple and land, escaped to sea in boats, and went coasting\r\n     from harbor to harbor; but when they had reached New\r\n     England, just as they would have set sail for their native\r\n     fields, they were stopped by orders from Nova Scotia. Those\r\n     who dwelt on the St. John's were torn once more from their\r\n     new homes. When Canada surrendered, hatred with its worst\r\n     venom pursued the 1,500 who remained south of the\r\n     Ristigouche. Once more those who dwelt in Pennsylvania\r\n     presented a humble petition to the Earl of Loudoun, then the\r\n     British Commander in-Chief in America; and the cold-hearted\r\n     peer, offended that the prayer was made in French, seized\r\n     their five principal men, who in their own land had been\r\n     persons of dignity and substance, and shipped them to\r\n     England, with the request that they might be kept from ever\r\n     again becoming troublesome by being consigned to service as\r\n     common sailors on board ships of war.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it was throughout:--\"We have been true,\" said they in one of\r\ntheir petitions, \"to our religion, and true to ourselves; yet nature\r\nappears to consider us only as the objects of public vengeance.\"--\"I\r\nknow not,\" writes Mr. Bancroft, \"if the annals of the human race keep\r\nthe records of wounds so wantonly inflicted, so bitter and so perennial\r\nas fell upon the French inhabitants of Acadia.\"\r\n\r\nAmerican history has at least one element of peculiar character. The\r\nvoyage of the Pilgrim Fathers--the settlement of the Virginia\r\ncavaliers--the foundation of Pennsylvania,--though all events of\r\nprofound moral interest, as well as productive of fine pictorial\r\neffects, are not without parallels more or less close in the varied tale\r\nof ancient and modern colonization. But that which is distinctive and\r\npeculiar in the story of American civilization is, its struggle against\r\nthe Red Men. Settlers, it is true, have often found themselves in\r\nstrange company. In Africa the Greek colonizer elbowed the swarthy\r\nEthiop. In South America the Spaniard stood beside the Peruvian and the\r\nCarib. Dutchmen have encountered the Malay and the Dyak. For two\r\ncenturies English settlers have had to deal with the uncivilized races\r\nof the East and West--from the Bushmen of the Cape to the savages of New\r\nZealand. But none of these races present the same attractive features as\r\nthe brethren of the Iroquois and the Mohicans. About these latter there\r\nare points of romantic and chivalric interest. Though not free from the\r\nvices of the savage, they often exhibit virtues which might shame the\r\nEuropean. There is something of dignity in their aspect and bearing.\r\nThey are seldom without a natural and original poetic sense,--and their\r\nlanguage has a wild Ossianic music. They are bold in metaphor and apt in\r\nnatural illustration. A group of actors on the scene having\r\ncharacteristics so peculiar and so attractive as the Red Skin is\r\ninvaluable to a historian whose tendency is to see events and note\r\ncharacter under their most pictorial aspects.\r\n\r\nThe part taken by the Indians in that war between the French and English\r\nin America which ended in the conquest of Quebec and the expulsion of\r\nthe Lilies from Canada is narrated at great length by Mr. Bancroft,--and\r\nthe atrocious nature of the conflict is well brought out. At the\r\ncommencement of the war, we are allowed a glimpse at a curious\r\nwar-council:\r\n\r\n     \"'Brothers,' said the Delawares to the Miamis, 'we desire\r\n     the English and the Six Nations to put their hands upon your\r\n     heads, and keep the French from hurting you. Stand fast in\r\n     the chain of friendship with the Government of Virginia.'\r\n     'Brothers,' said the Miamis to the English, 'your country is\r\n     smooth; your hearts are good; the dwellings of your\r\n     governors are like the spring in its bloom.' 'Brothers,'\r\n     they added to the Six Nations, holding aloft a calumet\r\n     ornamented with feathers, 'the French and their Indians have\r\n     struck us, yet we kept this pipe unhurt;' and they gave it\r\n     to the Six Nations, in token of friendship with them and\r\n     with their allies. A shell and a string of black wampum were\r\n     given to signify the unity of heart; and that, though it was\r\n     darkness to the westward, yet towards the sun-rising it was\r\n     bright and clear. Another string of black wampum announced\r\n     that the war-chiefs and braves of the Miamis held the\r\n     hatchet in their hand, ready to strike the French. The\r\n     widowed Queen of the Piankeshaws sent a belt of black shells\r\n     intermixed with white. 'Brothers,' such were her words, 'I\r\n     am left a poor, lonely woman, with one son, whom I commend\r\n     to the English, the Six Nations, the Shawnees, and the\r\n     Delawares, and pray them to take care of him.' The Weas\r\n     produced a calumet. 'We have had this feathered pipe,' said\r\n     they, 'from the beginning of the world; so that when it\r\n     becomes cloudy, we can sweep the clouds away. It is dark in\r\n     the west, yet we sweep all clouds away towards the\r\n     sun-rising, and leave a clear and serene sky.' Thus, on the\r\n     alluvial lands of Western Ohio, began the contest that was\r\n     to scatter death broadcast through the world. All the\r\n     speeches were delivered again to the Deputies of the\r\n     Nations, represented at Logstown, that they might be\r\n     correctly repeated to the head Council at Onondaga. An\r\n     express messenger from the Miamis hurried across the\r\n     mountains, bearing to the shrewd and able Dinwiddie, the\r\n     Lieutenant-Governor of Virginia, a belt of wampum, the scalp\r\n     of a French Indian, and a feathered pipe, with letters from\r\n     the dwellers on the Maumee and on the Wabash. 'Our good\r\n     brothers of Virginia,' said the former, 'we must look upon\r\n     ourselves as lost, if our brothers, the English, do not\r\n     stand by us and give us arms.' 'Eldest brother,' pleaded the\r\n     Picts and Windaws, 'this string of wampum assures you, that\r\n     the French King's servants have spilled our blood, and eaten\r\n     the flesh of three of our men. Look upon us and pity us, for\r\n     we are in great distress. Our chiefs have taken up the\r\n     hatchet of war. We have killed and eaten ten of the French\r\n     and two of their negroes. We are your brothers; and do not\r\n     think this is from our mouth only; it is from our very\r\n     hearts.' Thus they solicited protection and revenge.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Newcastle was unequal to the task of driving the soldiers of\r\nFrance from Canada or from the valley of the Mississippi. The North and\r\nSouth were both in the hands of France. The route of the Ohio and the\r\nMississippi had been discovered by adventurers and missionaries of that\r\nnation; and a few years of quiet possession of the territory would have\r\nallowed French statesmen to consolidate their power in those regions,\r\nand to draw a strong cordon around the entire group of English colonies\r\non the Atlantic sea-board. But Pitt's genius was brought to bear at a\r\ncritical moment on the arrangement of this great question--and he\r\nconceived the project of breaking the Mississippi line and attacking the\r\nenemy in their strongholds on the St. Lawrence. Three expeditions were\r\nfitted out. Amherst and Wolfe were ordered to join the fleet under\r\nBoscawen, destined to act against Louisburgh--Forbes was sent to the\r\nOhio Valley--Abercrombie was intrusted with the command against Crown\r\nPoint and Ticonderoga, though Lord Howe was sent out with the last named\r\nas the real soul of the enterprise. Mr. Bancroft writes:\r\n\r\n     \"None of the officers won favor like Lord Howe and Wolfe.\r\n     Both were still young. To high rank and great connections\r\n     Howe added manliness, humanity, capacity to discern merit,\r\n     and judgment to employ it. As he reached America, he entered\r\n     on the simple austerity of forest warfare. James Wolfe, but\r\n     thirty-one years old, had already been eighteen years in the\r\n     army; was at Dettingen and Fontenoy, and had won laurels at\r\n     Laffeldt. Merit made him at two-and-twenty a\r\n     lieutenant-colonel, and his active genius improved the\r\n     discipline of his battalion. He was at once authoritative\r\n     and humane, severe, yet indefatigably kind; modest, but\r\n     aspiring and secretly conscious of ability. The brave\r\n     soldier dutifully loved and obeyed his widowed mother, and\r\n     his gentle nature saw visions of happiness in scenes of\r\n     domestic love, even while he kindled at the prospect of\r\n     glory, as 'gunpowder at fire.'\"\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of May the expedition reached Halifax.--\r\n\r\n     \"For six days after the British forces on their way from\r\n     Halifax to Louisburgh, had entered Chapeau Rouge Bay, the\r\n     surf, under a high wind, made the rugged shore inaccessible,\r\n     and gave the French time to strengthen and extend their\r\n     lines. The sun still dashed heavily, when, before daybreak,\r\n     on the 8th of June, the troops, under cover of a random fire\r\n     from the frigates, attempted disembarking. Wolfe, the third\r\n     brigadier, who led the first division, would not allow a gun\r\n     to be fired, cheered on the rowers, and, on coming to shoal\r\n     water, jumped into the sea; and, in spite of the surf, which\r\n     broke several boats and upset more, in spite of the\r\n     well-directed fire of the French, in spite of their\r\n     breastwork and rampart of felled trees, whose interwoven\r\n     branches made one continued wall of green, the English\r\n     landed, took the batteries, drove in the French, and on the\r\n     same day invested Louisburgh. At that landing, none was more\r\n     gallant than young Richard Montgomery; just one-and-twenty;\r\n     Irish by birth; an humble officer in Wolfe's brigade; but\r\n     also a servant of humanity, enlisted in its corps of\r\n     immortals. The sagacity of Wolfe honored him with\r\n     well-deserved praise, and promotion to a lieutenancy. On the\r\n     morning of the 12th, an hour before dawn, Wolfe, with light\r\n     infantry and Highlanders, took by surprise the light-house\r\n     battery on the north-east side of the entrance to the\r\n     harbor; the smaller works were successively carried. On the\r\n     23d, the English battery began to play on that of the French\r\n     on the island near the centre of the mouth of the harbor.\r\n     Science, sufficient force, union among the officers,\r\n     heroism, pervading mariners and soldiers, carried forward\r\n     the siege, during which Barre by his conduct secured the\r\n     approbation of Amherst and the confirmed friendship of\r\n     Wolfe. Of the French ships in the port, three were burned on\r\n     the 21st of July; in the night following the 25th, the boats\r\n     of the squadron, with small loss, set fire to the Prudent, a\r\n     seventy-four, and carried off the Bienfaisant. Boscawen was\r\n     prepared to send six English ships into the harbor. But the\r\n     town of Louisburgh was already a heap of ruins; for eight\r\n     days, the French officers and men had had no safe place for\r\n     rest; of fifty-two cannon opposed to the English batteries\r\n     forty were disabled. The French had but five ships of the\r\n     line and four frigates. It was time for the Chevalier de\r\n     Drucour to capitulate. The garrison became prisoners of war,\r\n     and, with the sailors and marines, in all 5,637, were sent\r\n     to England. On the 27th of July, the English took possession\r\n     of Louisburgh, and, as a consequence, of Cape Breton and\r\n     Prince Edward's Island. Thus fell the power of France on our\r\n     eastern coast. Halifax being the English naval station,\r\n     Louisburgh was deserted. The harbor still offers shelter\r\n     from storms; the coast repels the surge: but a few hovels\r\n     only mark the spot which so much treasure was lavished to\r\n     fortify, so much heroism to conquer. Wolfe, whose heart was\r\n     in England, returned home with the love and esteem of the\r\n     army. His country was full of exultation; the trophies were\r\n     deposited with pomp in the cathedral of St. Paul's; the\r\n     churches gave thanks; Boscawen, himself a member of\r\n     parliament, was honored by a unanimous tribute from the\r\n     House of Commons. New England, too, triumphed; for the\r\n     praises awarded to Amherst and Wolfe recalled the heroism of\r\n     her own sons.\"\r\n\r\nThis success inspired Pitt to still greater efforts. He resolved to\r\nannex the \"boundless north,\" as it was then called, to the British\r\nempire in America; and early in the spring Wolfe again went out,--this\r\ntime, to conquer Quebec and find a soldier's grave. Many of his\r\ncompanions in arms were then and afterwards famous men:--Jervis,\r\nafterwards the renowned Earl St. Vincent, James Cook, the navigator,\r\nGeorge Townshend, Barre, and Colonel Howe.\r\n\r\n     \"On the 26th of June, the whole armament arrived, without\r\n     the least accident, off the Isle of Orleans, on which, the\r\n     next day, they disembarked. A little south of west the cliff\r\n     of Quebec was seen distinctly, seemingly impregnable, rising\r\n     precipitously in the midst of one of the grandest scenes in\r\n     nature. To protect this guardian citadel of New France,\r\n     Montcalm had of regular troops no more than six wasted\r\n     battalions; of Indian warriors few appeared, the wary\r\n     savages preferring the security of neutrals; the Canadian\r\n     militia gave him the superiority in numbers; but he put his\r\n     chief confidence in the natural strength of the country.\r\n     Above Quebec, the high promontory on which the upper town is\r\n     built expands into an elevated plain, having towards the\r\n     river the steepest acclivities. For nine miles or more above\r\n     the city, as far as Cape Rouge, every landing-place was\r\n     intrenched and protected. The river St. Charles, after\r\n     meandering through a fertile valley, sweeps the rocky base\r\n     of the town, which it covers by expanding into sedgy\r\n     marshes. Nine miles below Quebec, the impetuous Montmorenci,\r\n     after fretting itself a whirlpool route, and leaping for\r\n     miles down the steps of a rocky bed, rushes with velocity\r\n     towards the ledge, over which, falling two hundred and fifty\r\n     feet, it pours its fleecy cataract into the chasm. As Wolfe\r\n     disembarked on the Isle of Orleans, what scene could be more\r\n     imposing? On his left lay at anchor the fleet with the\r\n     numerous transports; the tents of his army stretched across\r\n     the island; the intrenched troops of France, having their\r\n     centre at the village of Beanport, extended from the\r\n     Montmorenci to the St. Charles; the city of Quebec,\r\n     garrisoned by five battalions, bounded the horizon. At\r\n     midnight on the 28th, the short darkness was lighted up by a\r\n     fleet of fire-ships, that, after a furious storm of wind,\r\n     came down with the tide in the proper direction. But the\r\n     British sailors grappled with them and towed them free of\r\n     the shipping. The river was Wolfe's; the men-of-war made it\r\n     so; and, being master of the deep water, he also had the\r\n     superiority on the south-shore of the St. Lawrence. In the\r\n     night of the 29th, Monckton, with four battalions, having\r\n     crossed the south channel, occupied Point Levi; and where\r\n     the mighty current, which below the town expands as a bay,\r\n     narrows to a deep stream of but a mile in width, batteries\r\n     of mortars and cannon were constructed. The citizens of\r\n     Quebec, foreseeing the ruin of their houses, volunteered to\r\n     pass over the river and destroy the works; but, at the\r\n     trial, their courage failed them, and they retreated. The\r\n     English, by the discharge of red-hot balls and shells, set\r\n     on fire fifty houses in a night, demolished the lower town,\r\n     and injured the upper. But the citadel was beyond their\r\n     reach, and every avenue from the river to the cliff was too\r\n     strongly intrenched for an assault.\"\r\n\r\nThe summer was going rapidly, and as yet no real progress had been made.\r\nWolfe was eager for action,--and he pursued his researches into the\r\nnature of the formidable position with extraordinary eagerness:--\r\n\r\n     \"He saw that the eastern bank of the Montmorenci was higher\r\n     than the ground occupied by Montcalm, and, on the 9th of\r\n     July, he crossed the north channel and encamped there; but\r\n     the armies and their chiefs were still divided by the river\r\n     precipitating itself down its rocky way in impassable eddies\r\n     and rapids. Three miles in the interior, a ford was found;\r\n     but the opposite bank was steep, woody, and well intrenched.\r\n     Not a spot on the line of the Montmorenci for miles into the\r\n     interior, nor on the St. Lawrence to Quebec, was left\r\n     unprotected by the vigilance of the inaccessible Montcalm.\r\n     The General proceeded to reconnoitre the shore above the\r\n     town. In concert with Saunders, on the 18th of July, he\r\n     sailed along the well-defended bank from Montmorenci to the\r\n     St. Charles: he passed the deep and spacious harbor, which,\r\n     at four hundred miles from the sea, can shelter a hundred\r\n     ships of the line; he neared the high cliff of Cape Diamond,\r\n     towering like a bastion over the waters, and surmounted by\r\n     the banner of the Bourbons; he coasted along the craggy wall\r\n     of rock that extends beyond the citadel; he marked the\r\n     outline of the precipitous hill that forms the north bank of\r\n     the river,--and every where he beheld a natural fastness,\r\n     vigilantly defended, intrenchments, cannon, boats, and\r\n     floating batteries guarding every access. Had a detachment\r\n     landed between the city and Cape Rouge, it would have\r\n     encountered the danger of being cut off before it could\r\n     receive support. He would have risked a landing at St.\r\n     Michael's Cove, three miles above the city, but the enemy\r\n     prevented him by planting artillery and a mortar to play\r\n     upon the shipping. Meantime, at midnight, on the 28th of\r\n     July, the French sent down a raft of five-stages, consisting\r\n     of nearly a hundred pieces; but these, like the fire-ships a\r\n     month before, did but light up the river, without injuring\r\n     the British fleet. Scarcely a day passed but there were\r\n     skirmishes of the English with the Indians and Canadians,\r\n     who were sure to tread stealthily in the footsteps of every\r\n     exploring party. Wolfe returned to Montmorenci. July was\r\n     almost gone, and he had made no effective advances. He\r\n     resolved on an engagement. The Montmorenci, after falling\r\n     over a perpendicular rock, flows for three hundred yards,\r\n     amidst clouds of spray and rainbow glories, in a gentle\r\n     stream to the St. Lawrence. Near the junction, the river\r\n     may, for a few hours of the tide, be passed on foot. It was\r\n     planned that two brigades should ford the Montmorenci at the\r\n     proper time of the tide, while Monckton's regiments should\r\n     cross the St. Lawrence in boats from Point Levi. The signal\r\n     was made, but some of the boats grounded on a ledge of rocks\r\n     that runs out into the river. While the seamen were getting\r\n     them off, and the enemy were firing a vast number of shot\r\n     and shells, Wolfe, with some of the navy officers as\r\n     companions, selected a landing-place; and his desperate\r\n     courage thought it not yet too late to begin the attack.\r\n     Thirteen companies of grenadiers, and two hundred of the\r\n     second battalion of the Royal Americans, who got first on\r\n     shore, not waiting for support, ran hastily towards the\r\n     intrenchments, and were repulsed in such disorder that they\r\n     could not again come into line; though Monckton's regiment\r\n     had arrived, and had formed with the coolness of invincible\r\n     valor. But hours hurried by; night was near; the clouds of\r\n     midsummer gathered heavily, as if for a storm; the tide\r\n     rose; and Wolfe, wiser than Frederic at Colin, ordered a\r\n     timely retreat.\"\r\n\r\nIn this unsuccessful attempt Wolfe lost 400 men. On the tortures of a\r\nbody wasted by fever and a mind preyed on by its own restless energy, we\r\nwill not dwell. Wolfe reckoned on assistance from the corps of\r\nAmherst,--but this did not arrive. At last he perceived that his fate\r\nrested in his own hands alone,--and he conceived the daring plan of\r\nattack which has given to his name the soldier's immortality. We extract\r\nMr. Bancroft's account of the brilliant attack which cost our young hero\r\nhis life and the French their dominions in Northern America:--\r\n\r\n     \"Every officer knew his appointed duty, when, at one o'clock\r\n     in the morning of the 13th September, Wolfe, with Monckton\r\n     and Murray, and about half the forces, set off in boats, and\r\n     without sail or oars, glided down with the tide. In\r\n     three-quarters of an hour the ships followed, and, though\r\n     the night had become dark, aided by the rapid current, they\r\n     reached the cove just in time to cover the landing. Wolfe\r\n     and the troops with him leaped on shore; the light infantry,\r\n     who found themselves borne by the current a little below the\r\n     intrenched path, clambered up the steep hill, staying\r\n     themselves by the roots and boughs of the maple and spruce\r\n     and ash trees that covered the precipitous declivity, and,\r\n     after a little firing, dispersed the picket which guarded\r\n     the height. The rest ascended safely by the pathway. A\r\n     battery of four guns on the left was abandoned to Colonel\r\n     Howe. When Townshend's division disembarked, the English had\r\n     already gained one of the roads to Quebec, and, advancing in\r\n     front of the forest, Wolfe stood at daybreak with big\r\n     invincible battalions on the plains of Abraham, the\r\n     battle-field of empire. 'It can be but a small party come to\r\n     burn a few houses and retire,' said Montcalm, in amazement,\r\n     as the news reached him in his intrenchments the other side\r\n     of the St. Charles; but, obtaining better\r\n     information,--'Then,' he cried, 'they have at last got to\r\n     the weak side of this miserable garrison; we must give\r\n     battle and crush them before mid-day.' And before ten, the\r\n     two armies, equal in numbers, each being composed of less\r\n     than five thousand men, were ranged in presence of one\r\n     another for battle. The English, not easily accessible from\r\n     intervening shallow ravines, and rail fences, were all\r\n     regulars, perfect in discipline, terrible in their fearless\r\n     enthusiasm, thrilling with pride at their morning's success,\r\n     commanded by a man whom they obeyed with confidence and\r\n     love. The doomed and devoted Montcalm had what Wolfe had\r\n     called but 'five weak French battalions,' of less than two\r\n     thousand men, 'mingled with disorderly peasantry,' formed on\r\n     ground which commanded the position of the English. The\r\n     French had three little pieces of artillery, the English one\r\n     or two. The two armies cannonaded each other for nearly an\r\n     hour; when Montcalm, having summoned Bougainville to his\r\n     aid, and despatched messenger after messenger for De\r\n     Vaudreuil, who had fifteen hundred men at the camp, to come\r\n     up, before he should be driven from the ground, endeavored\r\n     to flank the British and crowd them down the high bank of\r\n     the river. Wolfe counteracted the movement by detaching\r\n     Townshend with Amherst's regiment, and afterwards a part of\r\n     the Royal Americans, who formed on the left with a double\r\n     front. Waiting no longer for more troops, Montcalm led the\r\n     French army impetuously to the attack. The ill-disciplined\r\n     companies broke by their precipitation and the unevenness of\r\n     the ground; and fired by platoons, without unity. The\r\n     English, especially the forty-third and forty-seventh, where\r\n     Monckton stood, received the shock with calmness; and after\r\n     having, at Wolfe's command, reserved their fire till their\r\n     enemy was within forty yards, their line began a regular,\r\n     rapid, and exact discharge of musketry. Montcalm was present\r\n     every where, braving danger, wounded, but cheering by his\r\n     example. The second in command, De Sennezergues, an\r\n     associate in glory at Ticonderoga, was killed. The brave but\r\n     untried Canadians, flinching from a hot fire in the open\r\n     field, began to waver; and, so soon as Wolfe, placing\r\n     himself at the head of the twenty-eighth and the Louisburgh\r\n     grenadiers, charged with bayonets, they every where gave\r\n     way. Of the English officers, Carleton was wounded; Barre,\r\n     who fought near Wolfe, received in the head a ball which\r\n     destroyed the power of vision of one eye, and ultimately\r\n     made him blind. Wolfe, also, as he led the charge, was\r\n     wounded in the wrist, but still pressing forward, he\r\n     received a second ball; and, having decided the day, was\r\n     struck a third time, and mortally, in the breast. 'Support\r\n     me,' he cried to an officer near him: 'let not my brave\r\n     fellows see me drop.' He was carried to the rear, and they\r\n     brought him water to quench his thirst. 'They run, they\r\n     run,' spoke the officer on whom he leaned. 'Who run?' asked\r\n     Wolfe, as his life was fast ebbing. 'The French,' replied\r\n     the officer, 'give way every where.' 'What,' cried the\r\n     expiring hero, 'do they run already? Go, one of you, to\r\n     Colonel Burton; bid him march Webb's regiment with all speed\r\n     to Charles River to cut off the fugitives.' Four days\r\n     before, he had looked forward to early death with dismay.\r\n     'Now, God be praised, I die happy.' These were his words as\r\n     his spirit escaped in the blaze of his glory. Night,\r\n     silence, the rushing tide, veteran discipline, the sure\r\n     inspiration of genius had been his allies; his battle-field,\r\n     high over the ocean-river, was the grandest theatre on earth\r\n     for illustrious deeds; his victory, one of the most\r\n     momentous in the annals of mankind, gave to the English\r\n     tongue and the institutions of the Germanic race the\r\n     unexplored and seemingly infinite West and North. He crowded\r\n     into a few hours actions that would have given lustre to\r\n     length of life; and filling his day with greatness,\r\n     completed it before its noon.\"\r\n\r\nIn that terrible action fell also \"the hope of New France.\" In\r\nattempting to rally a body of fugitive Canadians in a copse near St.\r\nJohn's Gate, Montcalm was mortally wounded.\r\n\r\nWe have quoted enough from this volume to show how varied and stirring\r\nare the subjects with which Mr. Bancroft here deals.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] _History of the American Revolution._ By George Bancroft. Vol. I.\r\nBoston, Little & Brown, 1852.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the London Literary Gazette\r\n\r\nLIFE IN CANADA.\r\n\r\nBY MRS. MOODIE.[6]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there be one of life's affairs in which woman has a peculiar right to\r\nhave her wishes considered and her veto respected, it is that of\r\nemigration. For, in the arduous task of establishing a new home in a\r\nhalf-settled country, let man do what he will to alleviate, on her fall\r\nthe burthen and heat of the day. Hers are the menial toils, the frequent\r\nanxieties, the lingering home-sickness, the craving after dear friends'\r\nfaces and a beloved native land. Hers, too, the self-imposed duty and\r\nunselfish effort to hide regret under cheerful smiles, when the weary\r\nbrother or husband returns at evening from toil in field and forest.\r\nBlessed and beautiful are the smiles of the sad-hearted, worn to wile\r\naway another's cares!\r\n\r\nLove in a cottage has long been jeered at, and depicted as flying out of\r\nthe window. It seems miraculous to behold the capricious little deity\r\nsteadfastly braving, for many a long year, the chilly atmosphere of a\r\nlog-hut in an American forest. In the year 1832, Mrs. Moodie (here\r\nbetter remembered as Miss Susanna Strickland, sister of the well-known\r\nhistorian of the English and Scottish Queens) accompanied her husband, a\r\nhalf-pay subaltern, to the backwoods of Canada. Many were her\r\nmisgivings, and they did not prove unfounded. Long and cruel was the\r\nprobation she underwent, before finding comparative comfort and\r\nprosperity in the rugged land where at first she found so much to\r\nembitter her existence. Nobly did she bear up under countless\r\ndifficulties and sufferings, supported by an energy rare in woman, and\r\nby her devoted attachment to the husband of her choice. For some years\r\nher troubles were not occasional, but continual and increasing. Her\r\nfirst installation in a forest home could hardly have been more\r\ndiscouraging and melancholy than it was:\r\n\r\n     \"The place we first occupied was purchased of Mr. C----, a\r\n     merchant, who took it in payment of sundry large debts,\r\n     which the owner, a New England loyalist, had been unable to\r\n     settle. Old Joe H--, the present occupant, had promised to\r\n     quit it with his family at the commencement of sleighing;\r\n     and as the bargain was concluded in the month of September,\r\n     and we were anxious to plough for fall wheat, it was\r\n     necessary to be upon the spot. No house was to be found in\r\n     the immediate neighborhood save a small dilapidated log\r\n     tenement, on an adjoining farm (which was scarcely reclaimed\r\n     from the bush), that had been some months without an owner.\r\n     The merchant assured us that this could be made very\r\n     comfortable until such time as it suited H--to remove.\"\r\n\r\nWith singular want of caution, Mr. and Mrs. Moodie neglected to visit\r\nthis \"log tenement\" before signing an agreement to rent it. On a rainy\r\nSeptember day they proceed to take possession:\r\n\r\n     \"The carriage turned into a narrow, steep path, overhung\r\n     with lofty woods, and after laboring up it with considerable\r\n     difficulty, and at the risk of breaking our necks, it\r\n     brought us at length to a rocky upland clearing, partially\r\n     covered with a second growth of timber, and surrounded on\r\n     all sides by the dark forest. 'I guess,' quoth our Yankee\r\n     driver, 'that at the bottom of this 'ere swell, you'll find\r\n     yourself _to hum_;' and plunging into a short path cut\r\n     through the wood, he pointed to a miserable hut, at the\r\n     bottom of a steep descent, and cracking his whip, exclaimed,\r\n     'It's a smart location that. I wish you Britishers may enjoy\r\n     it.' I gazed upon the place in perfect dismay, for I had\r\n     never seen such a shed called a house before. 'You must be\r\n     mistaken; that is not a house, but a cattle-shed, or\r\n     pig-sty.' The man turned his knowing keen eye upon me, and\r\n     smiled, half humorously, half maliciously, as he said, 'You\r\n     were raised in the old country, I guess; you have much to\r\n     learn, and more perhaps than you'll like to know, before the\r\n     winter is over.'\"\r\n\r\nThe prophet of evil spoke truly. It was a winter of painful instruction\r\nfor the inexperienced young woman, and her not very prudent husband. We\r\nmight fill columns with a bare list of their vexations and disasters.\r\nAmongst the former, not the least arose from the borrowing propensities\r\nof their neighbors. They had 'located' in a bad neighborhood, in the\r\nvicinity of a number of low Yankee squatters, \"ignorant as savages,\r\nwithout their courtesy and kindness.\" These people walked\r\nunceremoniously at all hours into their wretched dwelling, to criticise\r\ntheir proceedings, make impertinent remarks, and to borrow--or rather to\r\nbeg or steal, for what they borrowed they rarely returned. The most\r\nextraordinary loans were daily solicited or demanded; and Mrs. Moodie,\r\nstrange and timid in her new home, and amongst, these\r\nsemi-barbarians--her husband, too, being much away at the farm--for some\r\ntime dared not refuse to acquiesce in their impudent extortions. Here is\r\na specimen of the style of these miscalled 'borrowings.' On the first\r\nday of their arrival, whilst they were yet toiling to exclude wind and\r\nrain from the crazy hovel, which their baggage and goods filled nearly\r\nto the roof, a young Yankee 'lady' squeezed herself into the crowded\r\nroom:\r\n\r\n     \"Imagine a girl of seventeen or eighteen years of age, with\r\n     sharp, knowing-looking features, a forward impudent carnage,\r\n     and a pert flippant voice, standing upon one of the trunks,\r\n     and surveying all our proceedings in the most impertinent\r\n     manner. The creature was dressed in a ragged, dirty, purple\r\n     stuff gown, cut very low in the neck, with an old red cotton\r\n     handkerchief tied over her head; her uncombed, tangled locks\r\n     falling over her thin, inquisitive face in a state of\r\n     perfect nature. Her legs and feet were bare, and in her\r\n     coarse, dirty, red hands she swung to and fro an empty glass\r\n     decanter.\"\r\n\r\nThe mission of this squalid nymph was not to borrow but to lend. She\r\n\"guessed the strangers were fixin' there,\" and that they'd want a glass\r\ndecanter to hold their whisky, so she had brought one over. \"But\r\nmind--don't break it,\" said she; \"'tis the only one we have to hum, and\r\nfather says it's so mean to drink out of green glass\"--a sentiment\r\nworthy of a colonel of hussars. Although quite pleased by such\r\ndisinterested kindness and attention, Mrs. Moodie declined the decanter,\r\non the double ground of having some of her own, and of not drinking\r\nwhisky. The refusal was unavailing. The lady in ragged purple set down\r\nthe bottle on a trunk, as firmly as if she meant to plant it there, and\r\ntook herself off. The next morning cleared up the mystery of her\r\nperseverance. \"Have you done with that 'ere decanter I brought across\r\nyesterday?\" said the 'cute damsel, presenting herself before Mrs. Moodie\r\nwith her bare red knees peeping through her ragged petticoats, and with\r\nface and hands innocent of soap. The English lady returned the bottle,\r\nwith the remark that she had never needed it.\r\n\r\n     \"'I guess you won't return it empty,' quoth the obliging\r\n     neighbor; 'that would be mean, father says. He wants it\r\n     filled with whisky.'\"\r\n\r\nThe hearty laugh which this solution of the riddle provoked from the\r\ninmates of the log-house offended the female Yankee, who tossed the\r\ndecanter from hand to hand and glared savagely about her. But the\r\nridicule was insufficient to deter her from the whisky hunt. When\r\nassured there was none in the place, she demanded rum, and pointed to a\r\nkeg, in which she said she smelt it. Her keen olfactories had not\r\ndeceived her. The rum, she was told, was for the workmen:\r\n\r\n     \"'I calculate,' was the reply, 'when you've been here a few\r\n     months, you'll be too knowing to give rum to helps. But\r\n     old-country folks are all fools, and that's the reason they\r\n     get so easily sucked in, and be so soon wound up. Cum, fill\r\n     the bottle, and don't be stingy. In this country we all live\r\n     by borrowing. If you want any thing, why, just send and\r\n     borrow from us.'\"\r\n\r\nWhen the decanter was filled and delivered to this saucy mendicant, Mrs.\r\nMoodie ventured to petition for a little milk for her infant, but\r\nImpudence in purple laughed in her face, and named an exorbitant price\r\nat which she would _sell_ it her, for cash on delivery. It seems\r\nincredible that, after this ingratitude, Mrs. Moodie continued her\r\n'lendings' to the family of which her new acquaintance was a\r\ndistinguished ornament.\r\n\r\n     \"The very day our new plough came home, the father of this\r\n     bright damsel, who went by the familiar name of _Old Satan_,\r\n     came over to borrow it (though we afterwards found out that\r\n     he had a good one of his own). The land had never been\r\n     broken up, and was full of rocks and stumps, and he was\r\n     anxious to save his own from injury; the consequence was,\r\n     that the borrowed implement came home unfit for use, just at\r\n     the very time we wanted to plough for fall wheat. The same\r\n     happened to a spade and trowel, bought in order to plaster\r\n     the house. Satan asked the loan of them for _one_ hour, for\r\n     the same purpose, and we never saw them again.\"\r\n\r\nThe other neighbors were no better. One Yankee dame used to send over\r\nher son, a hopeful youth, Philander by name, almost every morning, to\r\nborrow the bake-kettle, in which hot cakes were cooked for breakfast.\r\nOne day, when Mrs. Moodie was later than usual in rising, she heard from\r\nher bedroom the kitchen latch lifted. It was Philander, come for the\r\nkettle.\r\n\r\n     \"_I (through the partition):_ 'You can't have it this\r\n     morning. We cannot get our breakfast without it,'\r\n     _Philander:_ 'No more can the old woman to hum,' and,\r\n     snatching up the kettle, which had been left to warm on the\r\n     hearth, he rushed out of the house, singing at the top of\r\n     his voice, 'Hurrah for the Yankee boys!' When James (the\r\n     servant) came home for his breakfast, I sent him across to\r\n     demand the kettle, and the dame very coolly told him, that\r\n     when she had done with it I might have it; but she defied\r\n     him to take it out of her house with her bread in it.\"\r\n\r\nSince the request of the drover who begged his comrade to lend him a\r\nbark of his dog, we have not heard of queerer loans than some of those\r\nsolicited of Mrs. Moodie:--\r\n\r\n     \"Another American squatter was always sending over to borrow\r\n     a small-tooth comb, which she called a _vermin destroyer_;\r\n     and once the same person asked the loan of a towel, as a\r\n     friend had come from the States to visit her, and the only\r\n     one she had, had been made into a best 'pinny' for the\r\n     child: she likewise begged a sight in the looking-glass, as\r\n     she wanted to try on a new cap, to see if it were fixed to\r\n     her mind. This woman must have been a mirror of neatness\r\n     when compared with her dirty neighbors. One night I was\r\n     roused up from my bed for the loan of a pair of\r\n     'steelyards.' For what purpose, think you, gentle reader? To\r\n     weigh a new-born infant. The process was performed by tying\r\n     the poor squalling thing up in a small shawl, and suspending\r\n     it to one of the hooks. The child was a fine boy, and\r\n     weighed ten pounds, greatly to the delight of the Yankee\r\n     father. One of the drollest instances of borrowing I have\r\n     ever heard of was told me by a friend. A maid-servant asked\r\n     her mistress to go out on a particular afternoon, as she was\r\n     going to have a party of her friends, and _wanted the loan\r\n     of the drawing-room_.\"\r\n\r\nTraits such as these exhibit, more vividly than volumes of description,\r\nthe sort of savages amongst whom poor Mrs. Moodie's lot was cast. They\r\nhad all the worst qualities of Yankee and Indian--the good ones of\r\nneither. They had neither manners, heart, nor honesty. The basest\r\nselfishness, cunning, and malignity were their prominent\r\ncharacteristics. A less patient and good-tempered person than Mrs.\r\nMoodie would, however, have had little difficulty in getting rid of the\r\ntroublesome and intrusive borrowers. They could not bear a sharp rebuke,\r\nand, more than once, a happy and pointed retort rid her, for weeks, or\r\neven for ever, of the pestilent presence of one or other of them. An\r\nEnglish farmer, settled near at hand, to whom she mentioned her\r\nannoyances, laughed--as well he might--at her easy-going toleration.\r\n\"Ask them sharply what they want,\" he said, \"and, failing a satisfactory\r\nanswer, bid them leave the house. Or--a better way still--buy some small\r\narticle of them, and bid them bring the change.\" Mrs. Moodie tried the\r\nlatter plan, and with no slight success.\r\n\r\n     \"That very afternoon, Miss Satan brought me a plate of\r\n     butter for sale. The price was three and nine pence; twice\r\n     the sum, by-the-bye, that it was worth. 'I have no\r\n     change,'--giving her a dollar--'but you can bring it to me\r\n     to-morrow.' Oh! blessed experiment! for the value of one\r\n     quarter dollar I got rid of this dishonest girl for ever.\r\n     Rather than pay me, she never entered the house again.\"\r\n\r\nThe strange names of some of the farmers and squatters in Mrs. Moodie's\r\nneighborhood exceed belief. Amongst the substantial yeomen thereabouts\r\nwere Solomon Sly, Reynard Fox, and Hiram Dolittle. Ammon and Ichabod\r\nwere two hopeful Canadian youths, the former of whom--a child of tender\r\nyears--was in the habit of hideously swearing at his father, and then\r\nscampering across the meadow, and defying the pursuit of his pursy\r\nprogenitor. This is another family of which Mrs. Moodie gives amusing\r\nglimpses, in a style sufficiently masculine, but therefore all the\r\nbetter adapted to the subject:--\r\n\r\n     \"The conversation was interrupted by a queer-looking urchin\r\n     of five years old, dressed in a long-tailed coat and\r\n     trowsers, popping his black shock head in at the door and\r\n     calling out, 'Uncle Joe! You're wanted to hum.' 'Is that\r\n     your nephew?' 'No! I guess it's my woman's eldest son,' said\r\n     uncle Joe, rising; 'but they call me Uncle Joe. 'Tis a spry\r\n     chap that--as cunning as a fox. I tell you what it is--he\r\n     will make a smart man. Go home, Ammon, and tell your ma that\r\n     I am coming.' 'I won't,' said the boy; 'you may go hum and\r\n     tell her yourself. She has wanted wood cut this hour, and\r\n     you'll catch it!' Away ran the dutiful son, but not before\r\n     he had applied his forefinger significantly to the side of\r\n     his nose, and, with a knowing wink, pointed in the direction\r\n     of hum. Uncle Joe obeyed the signal, drily remarking that he\r\n     could not leave the barn door without the old hen clucking\r\n     him back. At this period we were still living in Old Satan's\r\n     log house, and anxiously looking out for the first snow to\r\n     put us in possession of the good substantial log dwelling\r\n     occupied by Uncle Joe and his family, which consisted of a\r\n     brown brood of seven girls and this highly-prized boy.\"\r\n\r\nThe names of the squatter ladies were of a far superior description to\r\nthose to which their brothers answered. Looking down upon the Old\r\nTestament, their godfathers had resorted for suggestions to the Italian\r\nOpera, the heathen mythology, and the Minerva press. She of the purple\r\ngarment was called Emily. This was quiet enough. But her associates were\r\nCinderellas, Minervas, and Almerias; and Amanda was the baptismal\r\nappellation of one of Ammon's sisters.\r\n\r\nOld Joe, it will be remembered, had agreed to quit, when winter set in,\r\nthe house belonging to the farm which Mr. Moodie had purchased. But even\r\nin civilized and lawyer-ridden England possession is held to be nine\r\npoints of the law, and in Canada the other tenth is thrown in. Old Joe's\r\nmother, an abominable Yankee Hecate, grinned like a whole bag-full of\r\nmonkeys when informed that her son was expected to dis-locate as soon as\r\nsleighing began.\r\n\r\n     \"'Joe,' she guessed, 'would take his own time. The house was\r\n     not built which was to receive him; and he was not the man\r\n     to turn his back upon a warm hearth to camp in the\r\n     wilderness. It was neither the first snow nor the last frost\r\n     that would turn Joe out of his comfortable home.'\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hecate spoke a true word. Frost came, sledges ran, thaw began--not\r\nan inch budged Joe. The sun gained power, a soft south wind fanned the\r\nfrozen earth, the snow disappeared--still the reckless, dishonest scamp\r\nmade no sign of removing, and replied with abuse to the remonstrances of\r\nthose to whom his dwelling belonged. In the States, and with a brother\r\nYankee, his obstinacy might have led to revolver and rifle work. The\r\nEnglish emigrants patiently waited, to their own great inconvenience.\r\nJoe reckoned he shouldn't move till his 'missus' was confined--an\r\ninteresting event which was expected to come off in May. About the\r\nmiddle of that month the Joe family was increased by a sturdy boy,\r\nwhereupon its chief declared his intention of turning out in a\r\nfortnight, if all went well. Mrs. Moodie did not believe him--he had\r\nlied so often before; but he was determined to take her in at last, as\r\nhe had done at first, for this time he was as good as his word. On the\r\nlast day of May they went, bag and baggage, and Mrs. Moodie sent over\r\nher Scotch maid-servant and Irish serving-man to clear out the dwelling,\r\nwhich she justly expected would be in bad enough condition. But her\r\nexpectations were far exceeded by the reality. The malignity of these\r\npeople, who from her had received nothing but kindness and good offices,\r\nwas degrading to human nature. Presently the Irishman returned, panting\r\nwith indignation:\r\n\r\n     \"'The house,' he said, 'was more filthy than a pig-sty.' But\r\n     that was not the worst of it; Uncle Joe, before he went, had\r\n     undermined the brick chimney, and let all the water into the\r\n     house. 'Oh! but if he comes here agin,' he continued,\r\n     grinding his teeth and doubling his fist, 'I'll thrash him\r\n     for it. And thin, Ma'arm, he has girdled round all the best\r\n     graft apple-trees, the murtherin' owld villain, as if it\r\n     would spile his digestion our ating them.'\r\n\r\n     \"John and Bell scrubbed at the house all day, and in the\r\n     evening they carried over the furniture, and I went to\r\n     inspect our new dwelling. It looked beautifully clean and\r\n     neat. Bell had whitewashed all the black, smoky walls, and\r\n     boarded ceilings, and scrubbed the dirty window-frames, and\r\n     polished the fly-spotted panes of glass, until they actually\r\n     admitted a glimpse of the clear air and the blue sky.\r\n     Snow-white-fringed curtains, and a bed with furniture to\r\n     correspond, a carpeted floor, and a large pot of green\r\n     boughs on the hearthstone, gave an air of comfort and\r\n     cleanliness to a room which, only a few hours before, had\r\n     been a loathsome den of filth and impurity. This change\r\n     would have been very gratifying, had not a strong,\r\n     disagreeable odor almost deprived me of my breath as I\r\n     entered the room. It was unlike any thing I had ever smelt\r\n     before, and turned me so sick and faint, that I had to cling\r\n     to the door-post for support.\r\n\r\n     \"'Where does this dreadful smell come from?'\r\n\r\n     \"'The guidness knows, ma'am; John and I have searched the\r\n     house from the loft to the cellar, but we canna find out the\r\n     cause of the stink.'\r\n\r\n     \"'It must be in the room, Bell, and it is impossible to\r\n     remain here, or to live in the house, until it is removed.'\r\n\r\n     \"Glancing my eyes all round the place, I spied what seemed\r\n     to me a little cupboard, over the mantel-shelf, and I told\r\n     John to see if I was right. The lad mounted upon a chair,\r\n     and pulled open a small door, but almost fell to the ground\r\n     with the dreadful stench which seemed to rush from the\r\n     closet.\r\n\r\n     \"'What is it, John?' I cried from the open door.\r\n\r\n     \"'A skunk! ma'arm, a skunk! Sure, I thought the devil had\r\n     scorched his tail, and left the grizzled hair behind him.\r\n     What a strong perfume it has!' he continued, holding up the\r\n     beautiful but odious little creature by the tail.\r\n\r\n     \"'By dad! I know all about it now. I saw Ned Layton, only\r\n     two days ago, crossing the field with Uncle Joe, with his\r\n     gun on his shoulder, and this wee bit baste in his hand.\r\n     They were both laughing like sixty. 'Well, if this does not\r\n     stink the Scotchman out of the house,' said Joe, 'I'll be\r\n     content to be tarred and feathered;' and thin they both\r\n     laughed until they stopped to draw breath.'\r\n\r\n     \"I could hardly help laughing myself; but I begged Monaghan\r\n     to convey the horrid creature away, and putting some salt\r\n     and sulphur into a tin plate, and setting fire to it, I\r\n     placed it on the floor in the middle of the room, and closed\r\n     all the doors for an hour, which greatly assisted in\r\n     purifying the house from the skunkification. Bell then\r\n     washed out the closet with strong ley, and in a short time\r\n     no vestige remained of the malicious trick Uncle Joe had\r\n     played off upon us.\"\r\n\r\nThe smell of skunk and Yankee eradicated, there still was much to be\r\ndone before the house could be deemed habitable. It swarmed with mice,\r\nwhich all the night long performed fantastical dances over the faces and\r\npillows of the new comers. The old logs which composed the walls of the\r\ndwelling were alive with bugs and large black ants, and the fleas upon\r\nthe floor were as thick as sand-grains in the desert. With the warm\r\nweather, then just setting in, came legions of mosquitoes, that rose in\r\nclouds from the numerous little streams intersecting the valley. But in\r\nspite of all these discomforts, summer was felt to be a blessing, and\r\n\"roughing it\" in the woods was far less painful than in the season of\r\nsnow, and frost, and storm.\r\n\r\n     \"The banks of the little streams abounded with wild\r\n     strawberries, which, although small, were of a delicious\r\n     flavor. Thither Bell and I, and the baby, daily repaired to\r\n     gather the bright red berries of nature's own providing.\r\n     Katie, young as she was, was very expert at helping herself,\r\n     and we used to seat her in the middle of a fine bed, whilst\r\n     we gathered farther on. Hearing her talking very lovingly to\r\n     something in the grass, which she tried to clutch between\r\n     her white hands, calling it 'pitty, pitty,' I ran to the\r\n     spot and found it was a large garter-snake that she was so\r\n     affectionately courting to her embrace. Not then aware that\r\n     this formidable looking reptile was perfectly harmless, I\r\n     snatched the child up in my arms, and ran with her home,\r\n     never stopping until I reached the house and saw her safely\r\n     seated in her cradle.\"\r\n\r\nSixteen years elapsed after the departure of Joe and his brood from her\r\nneighborhood before Mrs. Moodie heard any thing of their fate. A winter\r\nor two ago, tidings of them reached her through one who had lived near\r\nthem. Hecate, almost a centenarian, occupied a corner of her son's barn.\r\nShe could not dwell in harmony under the same roof with her\r\ndaughter-in-law. The lady in purple and her sisters were married and\r\nscattered abroad. Joe himself, who could neither read nor write, had\r\nturned itinerant preacher. No account was given of the hopeful Ammon.\r\n\r\nMrs. Moodie's work, unaffectedly and naturally written, though a little\r\ncoarse, will delight ladies, please men, and even amuse children. On our\r\nreaders' account we regret our inability to make further extracts from\r\nits amusing pages. The book is one of great originality and interest.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] _Roughing it in the Bush; or, Life in Canada._ 2 vols. Bentley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the London Literary Gazette.\r\n\r\nMR. SQUIER ON NICARAGUA.[7]\r\n\r\n\r\nMany causes are combining to give great importance to the States of\r\nCentral America. Their own fertility and natural advantages, the\r\ncommerce of the Pacific, and the gold of California, unite to attract\r\nthe earnest attention of enterprising men and politicians towards them.\r\nAt the present moment, the appearance of this full and able account of\r\nNicaragua is peculiarly well-timed. The writer of it describes himself\r\nas \"late _charge d'affaires_ of the United States to the Republics of\r\nCentral America.\" His official position has evidently enabled him to get\r\nat much information that would otherwise have been inaccessible. His\r\nname is well and favorably known to ethnologists and antiquarians by his\r\nresearches into the history of the aboriginal monuments of the United\r\nStates, and by his very curious, though somewhat fanciful, essay on \"The\r\nSerpent Symbol, and the Worship of the Reciprocal Principles of Nature\r\nin America.\" The bias and extent of his studies make him a very\r\ncompetent person to investigate the antiquities of Nicaragua. The\r\nchapters devoted to this subject in the work before us are full of\r\ninterest, and highly to be valued for the abundance of fresh\r\nobservations they contain. Like many American archaeologists and\r\nhistorians, Mr. Squier is inclined to over-estimate the peculiarities\r\nand antiquity of the aborigines of the New World. If we understand\r\nrightly, he claims for them an independent origin. His ethnology is of\r\nthe romantic school, and rather loose. His imagination gets the better\r\nof his reasoning, and his \"organ of wonder,\" to speak in the manner of\r\nphrenologists, is over-developed. His habits of mind and training do not\r\nseem to be such as to qualify him for strict scientific research. He is\r\nmore of the _litterateur_ than the philosopher. His writings are, in\r\nconsequence, very amusing, but require to be dealt with cautiously. The\r\nfacts must be winnowed from the fancies with which they are mingled, if\r\nwe wish to use them for scientific purposes.\r\n\r\nImaginative men are usually warm lovers and fierce haters. Our American\r\nenvoy's appreciation of female charms is so intense, that he cannot pass\r\na pretty woman without inscribing a memorandum respecting her in his\r\nnote-book, afterwards to be printed more at length with additional\r\nexpressions of admiration. A pair of black eyes cannot sparkle behind a\r\nlattice without being duly recorded. His affection for the ladies is\r\nonly equalled by his dislike of the \"Britishers.\" The handsomest girl\r\nand the ugliest idol could scarcely distract his thought from the vices\r\nand crimes of England and the English. If he is to be trusted, the whole\r\npopulation of Central America regards every Englishman as a bitter\r\nenemy. He paints us in the blackest hues, and prophesies the fall of\r\nEngland with undisguised delight. Bluster about Britain is the prominent\r\nfault of the book, and one for which the writer will, when he knows more\r\nabout us, be ashamed of himself. Every day it is becoming more and more\r\nthe interest of Englishmen and Americans to pull together. Consanguinity\r\nand the love of constitutional liberty are strong ties. They may be\r\nforgotten for a time, but in the end must work uppermost. Recent events\r\nhave done much to remind us of our near relationship with our\r\ntransatlantic cousins, and them of the Anglo-Saxon blood to which they\r\nowe their pre-eminence among the nations of the New World. The grasping\r\nand interfering qualities that bring down upon us the unmitigated\r\ncensures of Mr. Squier are quite as prominently manifested in the doings\r\nof his countrymen; and whilst in one chapter he censures our meddlings\r\nwith, and claims upon, the Mosquito shore, in another he anticipates\r\nsomething very like the annexation of all Central America to the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe Mosquito country, about which we have seen of late so many very\r\nunsatisfactory paragraphs in our newspapers, is a thinly populated and\r\nmost unhealthy tract on the Atlantic sea-board of Central America. It is\r\ninhabited by a mixed breed of Indians and Negroes, supposed to be ruled\r\nby a semi-civilized individual, who rejoices in the entomological title\r\nof King of the Mosquitoes, one by no means inappropriate, considering\r\nthe amount of small annoyance we have endured through disputes about his\r\nterritory. He is supposed to be under British protection; it is\r\ndifficult to understand exactly why. The main purpose we have in view\r\nseems to be the securing a proper supply of the peculiar hard woods of\r\nthis region. Britons at home generally make peace over their mahogany;\r\nabroad they seem to pick quarrels over it.\r\n\r\nCentral America includes an era of 150,000 square miles. Under Spanish\r\ndominion it was divided into the provinces of Guatemala, Honduras, San\r\nSalvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. These became independent states in\r\n1821, and subsequently united to form the \"Republic of Central America.\"\r\nThey separated again, in 1839, into so many distinct republics.\r\nNicaragua, Honduras, and San Salvador have recently confederated. The\r\nentire region of Central America presents very marked and important\r\nphysical features. These are the great plain, six thousand feet above\r\nthe sea, upon which stands the city of Guatemala; the high plain forming\r\nthe centre of Honduras and part of Nicaragua; and the elevated country\r\nof Costa Rica. Between the two latter lies the basin of the Nicaraguan\r\nLakes, with broad and undulating verdant slopes broken by steep volcanic\r\ncones, and a few ranges of hills along the shores of the Pacific,\r\nintermingled with undulating plains. Of the two great lakes, the lesser,\r\nManagua, is one hundred and fifty-six feet, and the larger, Nicaragua,\r\none hundred and twenty-eight feet above the Pacific ocean. The former is\r\nfifty or sixty miles in length by thirty-five wide, the latter above a\r\nhundred miles long by fifty wide. On or near their western borders are\r\nthe chief cities of the country. Enormous isolated volcanic cones rise\r\nto the height of from 4000 to 7000 feet in their neighborhood or on the\r\nislands that stud them. Numerous remains of antiquity, ruins of temples,\r\nand deserted monolithic idols, give interest to their precincts, whilst\r\nthe scenery is described as being surpassingly grand and beautiful. The\r\nsole outlet is the river San Juan, a magnificent stream flowing from the\r\nsoutheastern extremity of Lake Nicaragua, for a length of about ninety\r\nmiles, into the Atlantic. The climate is generally healthy, more\r\nespecially towards the Pacific side. Nicaragua is inhabited by a\r\npopulation of about 260,000, one-half of which, or more, is composed of\r\nmixed breeds, Indians, in great part civilized, coming next in number,\r\nthen whites, of whom there are about 25,000, and, lastly, some 15,000\r\nNegroes. They live chiefly in towns, and cultivate the soil, which is\r\nvery productive, and capable of supporting a much larger population. The\r\nnatural resources of Nicaragua appear to be very great. Sugar, cotton,\r\ncoffee, indigo, tobacco, rice, and maize, are the chief productions.\r\nThere is, besides, great mineral wealth. In ancient times the aborigines\r\nappear to have occupied considerable cities, and to have attained a\r\ncivilization comparable with that of the Mexicans. Indeed, Mr. Squier\r\nhas proved, by philological and other evidence, that a Mexican colony\r\ndid exist in Nicaragua at the period of the discovery of the country in\r\nthe fifteenth century. This had been surmised before, but not clearly\r\nmade out.\r\n\r\nMuch interest attaches to the population of Nicaragua, on account of the\r\nlarge proportion of families of Indian blood, pure and mixed, of whom it\r\nis made up. The qualities which enabled the ancient Indian people of\r\nMexico, Central America, and Peru, to become civilized nations after a\r\npeculiar fashion, are not extinct, and seem to be retained and\r\nre-developed in proportion to the prevalence of Indian over Spanish\r\nblood. The Indians of Nicaragua are remarkable for industry and\r\ndocility; they are unobtrusive, hospitable, and brave, although,\r\nfortunately for themselves, not warlike. They make good soldiers, yet\r\nhave no morbid taste for the military profession. The men are\r\nagriculturists; the women occupy themselves with the weaving of cotton,\r\nand make fabrics of good quality and tasteful design. It is interesting\r\nto find the Tyrian dye still employed in their manufactures. They\r\nprocure it from a species of _Murex_ inhabiting the shores of the\r\nPacific. They take the cotton thread to the sea-side, where, having\r\ngathered together a sufficient quantity of shell-fish, they patiently\r\nsqueeze over the cotton the coloring fluid, at first pellucid and\r\ncolorless, from the animals, one by one. At first the thread is pale\r\nblue, but on exposure to the atmosphere becomes of the desired purple.\r\nThis color is so prized that purple thread dyed by cheaper and speedier\r\nmethods, imported from Europe, cannot supplant the native product. With\r\nmingled humanity and thrift they replace the whelks in their native\r\nelement, after these shell-fish have yielded up the precious liquor for\r\nwhich they were originally gathered. The Indian population also\r\nexclusively manufacture variegated mats and hammocks from the Pita, a\r\nspecies of Agave, and are as skilful as their ancient ancestors in the\r\nmaking of pottery. They do not use the potter's wheel. Politically they\r\nenjoy equal privileges with the whites, and all positions in church and\r\nstate are open to them. Among them are men of decided talent. Physically\r\nthey are a smaller and paler race than the Indians of the United States,\r\nbut are well developed and muscular. Their women are not unfrequently\r\npretty, and when young are often very finely formed.\r\n\r\nHappily in Nicaragua no distinctions of caste are recognized, or, at any\r\nrate, they have no influence. Such of the people as claim to be of pure\r\nSpanish blood are, in most instances, evidently partly of Indian\r\ndescent. The Sambos, or offspring of Indian and Negro parents, are a\r\nfine race of people, taller and stronger than the Indians.\r\n\r\nMr. Squier's admiration for the gentler (in Nicaragua we can scarcely\r\nsay the _fair_) sex, has led him to picture very vividly the charms and\r\nappearance of the ladies he encountered during his travels. The\r\nfollowing is a precise and tempting description:\r\n\r\n     \"The women of pure Spanish stock are very fair, and have the\r\n     _embonpoint_ which characterizes the sex under the tropics.\r\n     Their dress, except in a few instances where the stiff\r\n     costume of our own country had been adopted, was exceedingly\r\n     loose and flowing, leaving the neck and arms exposed. The\r\n     entire dress was often pure white, but generally the skirt,\r\n     or _nagua_, was of some flowered stuff, in which case the\r\n     _guipil_ (_anglice_, vandyke) was white, heavily trimmed\r\n     with lace. Satin slippers, a red or purple sash wound\r\n     loosely round the waist, and a rosary sustaining a little\r\n     golden cross, with a narrow golden band or a string of\r\n     pearls extending around the forehead and binding the hair,\r\n     which often fell in luxuriant waves upon their shoulders,\r\n     completed a costume as novel as it was graceful and\r\n     picturesque. To all this, add the superior attractions of an\r\n     oval face, regular features, large and lustrous black eyes,\r\n     small mouth, pearly white teeth, and tiny hands and feet,\r\n     and withal a low but clear voice, and the reader has a\r\n     picture of a Central American lady of pure stock. Very many\r\n     of the women have, however, an infusion of other families\r\n     and races, from the Saracen to the Indian and the Negro, in\r\n     every degree of intermixture. And as tastes differ, so many\r\n     opinions as to whether the tinge of brown, through which the\r\n     blood glows with a peach-like bloom, in the complexion of\r\n     the girl who may trace her lineage to the caziques upon one\r\n     side, and the haughty grandees of Andalusia and Seville on\r\n     the other, superadded, as it usually is, to a greater\r\n     lightness of figure and animation of face,--whether this is\r\n     not a more real beauty than that of the fair and more\r\n     languid senora, whose white and almost transparent skin\r\n     bespeaks a purer ancestry. Nor is the Indian girl, with her\r\n     full, little figure, long, glossy hair, quick and\r\n     mischievous eyes, who walks erect as a grenadier beneath her\r\n     heavy water-jar, and salutes you in a musical, impudent\r\n     voice as you pass--nor is the Indian girl to be overlooked\r\n     in the novel contrasts which the 'bello sexo' affords in\r\n     this glorious land of the sun.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nicaraguan ladies occupy themselves with smoking and displaying\r\nlittle feet in satin slippers when daily they go to church and back. In\r\nthe early evening they occasionally pay visits, and if a number of both\r\nsexes happen to assemble at the same house a dance is improvised, though\r\nregular parties or balls are rare and ceremonial.\r\n\r\nAt festival seasons the Nicaraguans have some curious customs,\r\napparently derived from their ancient heathen worship.\r\n\r\nIn some of the Nicaraguan towns, especially in Leon, the pernicious\r\npractice of burying the dead within the walls of city churches is\r\npersisted in, even as in London, and, just as with us, against the\r\nopposition of all sensible persons, including the government itself.\r\nFees to the church and attendant officials are at the root of the evil,\r\nand give it a vitality that defies all attempts at eradication. The\r\npriests of Leon have evaded all edicts about this nuisance, and have\r\nimproved upon the practice of our metropolitan parishes; for, not\r\ncontent with the revenues they derive from funerals, they charge\r\naccording to the length of time (from ten to twenty-five years) the dead\r\nare to be permitted by them to rest in their graves. When the purchased\r\ntime is up, the bones and the earth derived from the decomposed corpses\r\nare removed and sold to the manufacturers of nitre! The least warlike of\r\ncitizens may thus in the end become a defender of his country, when\r\nconverted into a constituent of gunpowder. The most quiet and\r\nunambitious of mortals may complete his career by making a noise in the\r\nworld, when fired off from a mortar. Assuredly this is a very novel and\r\noriginal method of shooting churchyard rubbish, and we recommend a fair\r\nconsideration of it to our vested parochial authorities.\r\n\r\nMr. Squier claims to be the first person who has described the ancient\r\nmonuments of Nicaragua, or, indeed, to have indicated their existence.\r\nExcellent and numerous plates and cuts of these very interesting though\r\nrather frightful relics are given in his work. Hitherto the antiquities\r\nof the northern portion of Central America only have been explored, and\r\nare familiar to us through the researches of Stephens and of Catherwood.\r\nThe Indians still reverence the shrines and statues of their ancient\r\ngods, and are apt to conceal their knowledge about their localities and\r\nexistence. Those described by our traveller have mostly suffered\r\ndilapidation through the religious zeal of the conquerors. They appear\r\nto differ among themselves somewhat in degree of antiquity, but there is\r\nno good reason--this is the conclusion to which Mr. Squier comes--for\r\nsupposing that they were not made by the nations found in possession of\r\nthe country. The structures in or about which, they were originally\r\nplaced were probably of wood, and great mounds and earthworks, like the\r\nteocallis of Mexico, were associated with them.\r\n\r\nA section of Mr. Squier's work is devoted to an elaborate dissertation\r\non the proposed interoceanic canal, illustrated by an excellent map. We\r\nrecommend these chapters to the consideration of all who are interested\r\nupon this important subject. Like most parts of his book it is defaced\r\nby not a few sneers at, and misstatements about, the English. About the\r\nbad taste of these outbursts we shall not say more. That they should\r\ncome from a man who is professionally a diplomatist, is evidence of his\r\nindiscretion and unfitness for his political calling. As an amusing\r\ntraveller and diligent antiquarian, however, we can do Mr. Squier full\r\nhonor, and were glad to see the just compliment lately paid to him in\r\nLondon, when our Antiquarian Society elected him an honorary member.\r\n\r\n[This interesting and important work of our countryman is reviewed in a\r\nflattering manner in most of the great organs of critical opinion in\r\nEngland, and its sale there, as well as in this country, has been very\r\nlarge for one so costly.]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] Nicaragua; its People, Scenery, Monuments, and the Proposed\r\nInter-oceanic Canal.

THE MIDNIGHT VOICE AND ITS ANSWERED CALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Randolph took leave of Lilias at the door of her room, and she\r\nhaving, with infinite trepidation, declined the services of the lady's\r\nmaid, who seemed to her rather more awful and stately than the lady\r\nherself, soon remained alone in the magnificent apartment which had been\r\nassigned to her. She looked all around it with a glance of some\r\ndisquietude, for the vastness of the room, and the dark oak furniture,\r\nmade it look very gloomy. She contemplated the huge bed, which bore an\r\nunpleasant resemblance to a hearse, with the utmost awe; it seemed to\r\nher that there was room for a dozen concealed robbers within the massive\r\nfolds of the sombre curtains, and the reflection of her own figure in\r\nthe tall mirrors, looked strangely like a white ghost wandering\r\nstealthily to and fro; the only gleam of comfort that shone in upon her,\r\nwas from the glimpse of the midnight sky that could be seen through the\r\nchinks of the window-shutters. As the night was not cold she went and\r\nthrew the window open, feeling that the companionship of the stars would\r\ndestroy all these fantastic fancies; and very soon her sense of\r\nloneliness and oppression passed away, for there came a soft wind that\r\nlifted the curls of her long fair hair, and kissed her cheek\r\ncaressingly, and she could not help believing it was a breeze from the\r\nIrish hills that bore to her the blessing of her kind old grandfather;\r\ngayly as ever she closed the window and went to sit down, wondering if\r\never she should feel inclined to sleep again after the excitement of the\r\nlast two days. She had unbound her hair and let it fall around her like\r\na golden veil, when, suddenly, a sound came floating towards her, on the\r\nstill night air, which irresistibly attracted her attention.\r\n\r\nIt was a sound of music, deep solemn music, rising with a power and\r\nrichness of melody she had never heard before; whence it came, or how it\r\nwas produced, she could not conceive, for it seemed to her unpractised\r\near not to proceed from one instrument, but from many, and yet there was\r\nthrough it all a unity of harmony which could result from the influence\r\nof a single mind alone: now, it swelled out into soft thunders that\r\nvibrated through the long passages up to the very roof of her vaulted\r\nroom, and deep into her beating heart, then it died away to a whisper\r\nfaint as the sigh of a child, only to rise again more glorious than\r\nbefore; and, over all, heard distinct as the lark in heaven at morning's\r\ndawn, there thrilled a voice of such unearthly sweetness that she could\r\nnot believe it belonged to an inhabitant of this world.\r\n\r\nLilias had one of those sensitive passionate souls over whom music has\r\nan uncontrollable power; but as yet she had heard no other instrument\r\nthan an antique harpsichord of her grandmother's, and such singing as\r\nthe village girls regaled her with when they stood at work in the\r\nfields. No wonder, then, that this wonderful strain had an effect upon\r\nher like that of enchantment; it seemed to take possession of her whole\r\nsoul, and absorb every faculty. She became, as she listened, utterly\r\nunconscious of all things, save that this entrancing melody drew her\r\ntowards it with an irresistible attraction; the sound was so distant,\r\nyet so clear, she could not tell if even it were within the house at\r\nall; but she did not ponder on its position, or on the nature of it;\r\nonly, like one who walks in sleep, she rose mechanically on her feet to\r\ngo to it. If her mind, steeped in that marvellous melody, could reflect\r\nat all, it was to conclude that she had fallen asleep and was dreaming,\r\nso that she had no thought but the longing not to awake from a dream so\r\nbeautiful. Slowly drawn by the sweet sounds, as by invisible chains, she\r\nmoved towards the door and opened it; then, sweeter, louder than before,\r\nfloating into her very soul, came that angel voice, with the full\r\nswelling chords that seemed, as it were, to clothe it, filling her with\r\na sense of enjoyment so intense, that she would have felt constrained to\r\nfollow after it, even had she known it would lure her to some murderous\r\nprecipice, like the dangerous sirens in the haunted woods of Germany.\r\n\r\nTruly there was a strange fascination in this soft and sublime music,\r\nfilling the quiet night as with a soul, whose breathing was melody. And\r\nLilias yielded without a thought, or effort, to the entrancing power,\r\nwhich, like a mesmeric influence, drew her imperiously towards it,\r\npanting and breathless, as though she feared the sounds would die before\r\nshe reached them--every faculty concentrated in the sense of hearing.\r\nShe hastened rapidly along the passages down the wide staircase, and,\r\nguided by the deepening, volume of the strain, reached the door of the\r\ngreat hall, which stood open. She passed within it, and at once\r\ndiscerned, that from this room proceeded the wonderful harmony, which\r\nhad so allured her, the instrument whose solemn tones formed the\r\naccompaniment was evidently the magnificent organ, which stood at the\r\nfurther end of the hall; and, as she had never heard one before, it is\r\nnot to be wondered at that now, when a hand endowed with extraordinary\r\nskill drew forth its full power, she should have been enraptured; but it\r\nwas not so much the majesty of sound, swelling from the noblest\r\ninstrument in the world, that had so won the very soul within her as the\r\nvoice, sounding almost celestial to her ears, which still was thrilling\r\nwith unutterable sweetness through the echoing hall. However glorious\r\nthose deep low chords, it was yet only the metal which gave them forth;\r\nbut there was a spirit in that voice which touched her own spirit, and\r\nnever again could her young soul be free and independent as it had been\r\nbefore that mysterious contact.\r\n\r\nA little while only does the new-created child of dust stand lonely upon\r\nearth, as Adam stood in Eden before he woke from his deep sleep to meet\r\nthe living glance of Eve--a little while in the passionless ignorance of\r\nyouth, and then is the mortal being free--free from thought, from\r\naffection, from desire; but soon, through all the wild tumult and\r\nturmoil of the world, he hears the voice calling to him, which demands\r\nthe surrender of his whole being in one deep human love, and no sooner\r\nis that whisper heard echoing in the depths of his heart than,\r\nstraightway, he yields up the sweet empire of his life's affections; and\r\nhenceforward, whether he is blest in close companionship, or divided by\r\nsome gulf impassable, over which, most vain and mournfully, he stretches\r\nout the longing arms that only grasp the vacant air, still never more is\r\nhe alone, or free, for he must live in another's life, and, even in\r\ndeath, desire another's grave.\r\n\r\nAnd was it to be thus with Lilias! the gentle, single-hearted child?\r\n\r\nAs she stood at the door of the hall, the words which that angel voice\r\nwas breathing into music came with a strange, deep meaning on her ears.\r\nThere was no light save that of the moon, which streamed in long, soft\r\nrays from the one large window, and reached even the gilded fluting of\r\nthe organ, yet, through the dim shadows, she could perceive that a\r\nmusician sat before it. The face only was visible to her in that half\r\nlight; the upturned face, with the dark hair falling round it, and the\r\ndeep gray eyes made luminous by the living soul that was shining through\r\nthem. Never had she looked on him who sat there before, nor could she\r\ntell if in truth that countenance had any beauty; only there was upon it\r\nnow a spiritual loveliness emanating from the solemn thoughts that moved\r\nhim, which entered into her heart and there abode, to fade only when\r\nitself should moulder beneath the coffin lid.\r\n\r\nAnd now, still drawn onwards by the voice, her noiseless feet went down\r\nthe hall, till, by the side of the unconscious musician, she knelt down\r\nmeekly, for it seemed to her as though adoring reverence were the\r\nneedful homage of one who could create such harmony; and there, in\r\nbreathless rapture, with parted lips, and folded hands, she remained all\r\nmotionless, till the soft music died away, as if those sounds had been\r\nwithdrawn again into the heaven to which they belonged.\r\n\r\nThen he turned, and his eyes fell upon the kneeling figure by his side;\r\nhe started violently, and remained mute with surprise, his heart well\r\nnigh stopping in its beating with astonishment; almost it seemed to him\r\nas if his music had drawn down an angel from the regions of perpetual\r\nmelody; so fair and spotless did she seem, the moonlight falling on her\r\nsoft white robes, and weaving her floating hair into a golden tissue\r\nwith the mingling of its own bright rays. Speechless he remained gazing\r\nwith the earnest wish that this pure vision might not pass away into a\r\ndream. But meantime the cessation of music had unbound the chains that\r\nheld her young soul captive, and when the sweet face turned towards him\r\nthe childlike features, solemn with intensity of feeling, he saw that\r\nthey were human eyes which met his own, eyes that could weep for sorrow,\r\nand grow beautiful with tenderness, for now a timid glance stole into\r\nthem, and a faint smile to the parted lips. Unconsciously, he let his\r\nhands fall softly on her head and said:\r\n\r\n\"Where have you come from? who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lilias,\" she answered, simply, as a child that tells its name when\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"Lily, indeed,\" he said, \"most fair and lovely as the snow-white lilies\r\nare; but no such gentle vision ever came to me before in these dark\r\nhours, though I have been here lonely, night by night. I thought at\r\nfirst it was a spirit kneeling there; and it is scarce less marvellous\r\nto me that a human being should visit me in my solitude, than that some\r\nmerciful angel should come to cheer me. How is it, then, that you are\r\nhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"The music seemed to call me and I came,\" she said; \"it was so very\r\nbeautiful it drew my whole soul after it; but I know I should not have\r\nventured here at such an hour, and now I will go back, only----\"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, and looked up pleadingly into the eyes that were turned\r\nwith such admiring wonder on her----\r\n\r\n\"You live in this house?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" he replied, and then bowed his head as though the answer were\r\none of shame.\r\n\r\n\"Then will you promise me,\" she said, \"that I shall hear these glorious\r\nsounds once more? I feel as though I could have no rest till I may\r\nlisten to them yet again, and to the voice that was as a soul within\r\nthem. May I come here to-morrow, and will you bestow on me the greatest\r\npleasure I have ever known, for, indeed, I never felt such deep\r\nenjoyment as in hearing that solemn strain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most gladly would I--most gladly see you again, sweet Lily; since that\r\nis your sweet name; but do you know who I am?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, excepting that I think you will be my friend,--at least I shall\r\nhope it,--for the soul that could utter that divine song must be so\r\nworthy of all friendship.\"\r\n\r\nThese gentle words seemed literally to make him tremble, as another\r\nmight to hear the ravings of passion.\r\n\r\n\"Oh do not speak so softly to me,\" he said, \"I am unused to kindness,\r\nand it unmans me; besides, soon you will know all, and then you will\r\nneither have the will nor power to befriend me, and it were better for\r\nme not to have the hope of your future sympathy, thus given for a\r\nmoment and then withdrawn.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why withdrawn?\" she said, with her gaze of innocent surprise.\r\n\r\n\"You are Sir Michael's niece, are you not, the child of his favorite\r\nbrother--his heiress probably?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am his niece, but not his heiress surely; there are so many worthier\r\nheirs, are you not one of them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I! I am Hubert Lyle.\" He seemed to expect that at the sound of that\r\nname she would recoil in fear or indignation, but she only repeated the\r\nwords \"Hubert Lyle,\" and then shook her head gently to intimate that it\r\nwas an unknown sound to her; he smiled with pleasure to hear his name so\r\nsoftly spoken by the lips of one who seemed to him the purest, sweetest\r\nvision that ever had blest his eyes on earth. \"I see you have not yet\r\nlearned all the secrets of this house,\" he said, \"but it will not be\r\nlong before Sir Michael's niece shall have been taught that there is one\r\nbeneath this roof whom she must hate, hate even with a deadly animosity.\r\nI think it will be a hard lesson for such a gentle nature;\" he added\r\nalmost pityingly. A new light seemed to break in upon her.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, is it possible?\" she exclaimed; \"was it then of you that my uncle\r\nspoke with such a bitter animosity, as it makes me shiver to think one\r\nhuman being should ever have the power to feel towards another?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am, indeed, the object of his abhorrence.\"\r\n\r\n\"But unjustly,\" she exclaimed, fixing her candid eyes steadily on his\r\nface. \"I know, I feel, you have not deserved this cruel hatred.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at your uncle's hands, indeed, not, I think, at those of any human\r\nbeing, for I know that wilfully I have injured none; but, doubtless,\r\nthis discipline is all too little for my deserts, as I must seem unto no\r\nmortal sight, and so it must be borne patiently.\" This humanity touched\r\nLilias to the very heart, her voice trembled with eagerness as she said:\r\n\r\n\"But do not speak as though I or any other could ever share in the wrong\r\nhe does you; rather is it our part to make you forget it, as you have\r\nforgiven it, by our friendship justly and gladly granted to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Most innocent child,\" he said, \"it is plain you never yet have listened\r\nto the voice of your worldly interest; but when that world shall have\r\ntaught you the value of Sir Michael's favor, then will even this\r\nguileless heart be moved to feel or simulate a due abhorrence for his\r\nenemy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" she exclaimed, lifting up her childlike head with a noble\r\ndignity, and throwing back the long hair that she might stand face to\r\nface with him to whom she spoke. \"Listen, I do not know you; as yet I\r\ncannot tell if in very deed you are worthy of the loyal true-hearted\r\nfriendship, which it is a blessing to give and to receive from our\r\nfellow-creatures; but my heart tells me you are so, even to the very\r\nuttermost, for I think that none could be otherwise, and dare to sing\r\nsuch solemn strains before high heaven at dead of night; and if it be\r\nso--if indeed you are worthy of the esteem and sympathy of all who can\r\ndistinguish between right and wrong--then is it your lawful due, of\r\nwhich I would not dare defraud you, for it were high treason against the\r\ntruth and majesty of goodness. If we are bound to adore perfection in\r\nits eternal Source and Essence, so is it our very duty and service to\r\npay tribute to the faint reflection of that spirit in the frail human\r\ncreature; and neither my uncle, nor any other on this earth, has a right\r\nto ask of me, or shall compel me, to act a lie against the sovereign\r\nvirtue I am sworn to worship loyally, by withholding the homage of my\r\nfriendship to all that are good and true of heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray heaven no taint from this bad world may ever reach your soul,\"\r\nwere the words that burst from the lips of Hubert Lyle. \"Yes, keep--keep\r\nyour pure wisdom and your noble principle; blessed is he who taught them\r\nto you; but, alas! if ever I were worthy of the gift of your esteem on\r\nthe basis of that rectitude of which you speak, could even your\r\nbeautiful philosophy stand the test to which it would be put before you\r\ncould give to _me_ the name of friend. The darkness covers me and you do\r\nnot yet know what I am--how smitten of heaven as well as hunted down of\r\nmen; how, by the very decree of nature, repugnant in their sight, not\r\nless than hated for another's sake. But I will not deceive you; none\r\ncould look upon your face and hide one shadow of the bitterest truth:\r\ncome, and let me show you what I am, and do not fear to shrink away from\r\nme when you have seen that sight. I hope for nothing else from any on\r\nthis earth, for the gentlest look that human eyes have ever had for me,\r\nhas been one of sorrowing pity.\"\r\n\r\nHe took her by the hand, and led her slowly down the hall towards the\r\nwindow, where the moonlight was streaming with a full clear radiance.\r\nThrough the shadows they went solemnly hand in hand, and a sensation of\r\nawe took possession of her; she felt as if he were leading her to the\r\nthreshold of a new life; strange and unknown feelings were stirring at\r\nher heart, and a deep instinct whispering there, seemed to tell her that\r\nwhat he was about to reveal would have an influence on her whole future\r\nexistence. He dropped her hand when they passed within the circle of\r\nlight, and, placing himself where the beams fell brightest, he turned\r\nand looked upon her. Then she saw that he was smitten indeed, and that\r\nheaven had laid a load upon his mortal frame, heavy, as that which man\r\nhad built upon his shrinking soul. Hubert Lyle was hopelessly and\r\nfearfully deformed. It would seem as though it were designed for him\r\nthat he should be crushed both in body and in spirit, for his neck was\r\nbowed as by an iron power, and the sadness of a life's long humiliation\r\nwas stamped on that upturned face; unlike the countenance of many who\r\nare deformed in body, there was no beauty on it save in the deep,\r\nthoughtful eyes, and the pale forehead, whence dark masses of hair were\r\nswept aside.\r\n\r\nOh, how the heart of Lilias trembled as she looked upon him and read the\r\nmeasure of his twofold suffering. An outcast, by deformity, from the\r\ncommon race of man, and trodden down in soul by unmerited contumely or\r\nhate. How to the very depths was stirred within her that well of\r\ntenderness and pity for the oppressed which gushes in every woman's\r\nheart, as she saw in his whole aspect the evidence of a resolute and\r\nnoble endurance, a patient meekness, untinged by a trace of bitterness!\r\nShe could have wept over him, for she was one of those unhappily gifted\r\nwhose soul is like a sensitive plant, and shrinks from the touch of\r\nsufferings in others with an exquisite susceptibility. Her natural\r\ndelicacy, however, taught her that she must hide from him how deeply his\r\ninfirmity had moved her; he must see in her no evidence of the insulting\r\npity to which alone he seemed accustomed. He had spoken of her shrinking\r\naway from him; she drew nearer, and lifting up her eyes, smiled one\r\nquiet, gentle smile, as though in token that she had seen nought to\r\nsurprise or grieve her; that look was balm to him, used only to the\r\nhalf-averted glance of sad repugnance which we are wont to cast on an\r\nunsightly object. His voice shook with mingled eagerness and delight as\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n\"Could you indeed take such a deformed wretch as I am by the hand, and\r\nstand forth before all the world to acknowledge him your friend?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it, then, the perishable, mortal body that we love and hold\r\ncommunion with, in those who are mercifully given to be our friends?\"\r\nshe answered; \"the frame that shall be a thing of dust and worms so\r\nsoon? Is it not the indestructible soul to which we give our sympathy,\r\nand is not that sympathy immortal as itself? for nothing good and pure\r\nthat ever was created can have power to perish, though it be only the\r\nsubtle feeling of a human heart; and so the friendship which is given by\r\none deathless spirit to another is a link between them for their\r\neternity of life, and what has it to do with the outward circumstances\r\nof our brief sojourn here?\" She paused, and then anxious to dispel the\r\nsort of solemnity which had gained on both of them, she said, playfully:\r\n\r\n\"You have not yet found a good reason why I should not some day be your\r\nfriend; but I think I shall soon give you little cause to wish for my\r\nacquaintance, if I keep you any longer in conversation at this strange\r\nhour of the night. I must go; for, indeed, I have lingered too long;\r\nbut, no doubt, we shall meet again.\" He did not seek to detain her; he\r\nfelt that he ought not; but he knew that the smile so sweet and kindly\r\nwith which she had looked on his unsightly frame would linger like a\r\nsunbeam in his memory; and that, yet more, the words of pure, calm\r\nwisdom she had uttered would never depart from his sad heart; for the\r\nfaith she had shown in that one deep truth, that all things good, and\r\nbeautiful, and worth the having, are created for eternity, and in no\r\nsense to be influenced by the accidents (so to speak) of this mere\r\noutward life, had suddenly lightened the load of his deformity, which so\r\nlong had crushed down his entire being, and made him feel that it was\r\nhis undying soul which stood face to face with hers--no less\r\nimmortal--and that he, the actual _ego_ the very self, had nought to do\r\nwith this poor frame, the magnet, as he long had deemed it, of the\r\nworld's hate and scorn, but, in truth, only the temporary clothing, soon\r\nto be put off, and now unworthy of a thought: he had felt this, as\r\nregards the life which was to come, when he should be disembarrassed of\r\nhis mortal body; but he had not understood what a deep joy the truth of\r\nthis principle could cast even into this present existence. None had\r\ntaught him, by the sweet teaching of entire sympathy, that all true\r\naffection is but planted in the germ here, and has its full fruition\r\nonly in eternity.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts rose like morning light on his soul, as he stood gazing,\r\nthoughtfully, upon her; whilst she, now that the enthusiasm, which had\r\nbeen called forth by the expression of her own bright faith had died\r\naway, had yielded to her womanly timidity, and stood half shy, half\r\nembarrassed, not knowing how to take leave of the companion she had so\r\nstrangely encountered. He saw this, and, with a ready courtesy, opened\r\nthe door for her, and bade her good night, thanking her gently for the\r\nsweet words of comfort she had spoken. She expressed a hope once more\r\nthat they should meet again, and so vanished from his sight. The white\r\nfigure passing away into the shadows, like some fair dream into the\r\ndarkness of a deeper sleep. He remained standing on the spot where she\r\nleft him, clasping his hands tightly on his breast. \"Meet again!\" he\r\nrepeated thoughtfully, echoing the words she had uttered. \"I will not\r\ndesire it; I will not seek it: surely it were the greatest peril that\r\never has crossed my path. How have I labored for peace these many years,\r\nand have attained it only by stripping my life of every hope and wish\r\nconnected with this world. I have so veiled my eyes to its allurements,\r\nfrom which I am for ever exiled, that all the living things within it\r\nhave become to me as moving shadows in the twilight; whilst my own soul\r\nhas been bathed in the sunlight of an eternal hope; but if the smile of\r\nthese sweet eyes came falling on my heart again--if the spirit that\r\nlooked through them be, indeed, as beautiful as I believe it--if, day\r\nby day, I saw the outward loveliness, and felt the inward beauty,\r\ninfinitely fairer, it could not fail, but I should grow to love her.\r\nI--I--the deformed outcast! Oh! could my worst enemy--could even he who\r\nhates the very ground on which I walk, desire for me a deeper curse than\r\nthat I should bring upon myself, if ever I made room in this my soul for\r\nhuman love. It must not be; I can and will avoid her. I will believe\r\nthat I have slept and woke again; and this night shall be to me but as\r\none in which I have dreamt a brighter dream than usual.\"\r\n\r\nHe resumed his habitual composure as these thoughts passed through his\r\nmind; the resolute calm, which was the habitual expression of his face,\r\nreturned to it, and quietly he left that old hall where the first scene\r\nin the drama of Lilias Randolph's life had been enacted.\r\n\r\nShe soon was lying in a tranquil slumber--the deep sleep of an innocent\r\nheart that is altogether at rest; but through all her dreams that night,\r\nthere went a voice whose echo was to haunt her soul for evermore.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. A MEETING FOR THE DISSECTION OF SOULS.\r\n\r\nLilias, like most blythe young spirits, never could sleep after the\r\nmorning beams came to visit her eyelids; and, despite the unusual\r\nexcitement of the preceding night, she was roaming through the house at\r\na very early hour, looking bright and fresh as the day-dawn itself. She\r\npassed through the old hall with timid steps, though it was now deserted\r\nby the musician, with whom her thoughts had been busy ever since she\r\nawoke. Deep was the pity that had sprung to life, never more to die in\r\nher young heart for him: not a barren pity, but active, tender,\r\n_woman-like_, that would take no rest till it had found some means of\r\nministering to his happiness. For the present it expended itself in an\r\nearnest desire to discover all concerning him, and most especially\r\nwhether, amongst all the inhabitants of Randolph Abbey, he had no friend\r\nto counterbalance the animosity of his one known enemy. To see him again\r\nlikewise, not once but often, was a determination which she could not\r\nfail to form after the conversation she had held with him; her generous\r\nspirit was in some sense bound to this, and it did but deepen her\r\nlonging to draw near to one so doubly stricken. Occupied with these\r\nthoughts, Lilias passed through the drawing-room to a verandah which\r\nopened from it, and where she could enjoy the fresh air whilst sheltered\r\nfrom the sun. There were couches placed there, and as Lilias moved\r\ntowards one of them, she was startled by perceiving a motionless figure\r\nextended upon it.\r\n\r\nIt was Aletheia, apparently in a profound slumber; but to Lilias she\r\nseemed like a corpse laid out for burial, so pale, so rigid was her\r\nface. The cold, white hands were folded on her breast as in dumb\r\nsupplication, and they were scarce stirred by her slow breathing, or the\r\ndull, heavy beating of her heart. Her countenance bore an expression of\r\nextreme fatigue, and it seemed plain to Lilias that she had been walking\r\nto a great distance. Her hair, matted with dew, was clinging wet to her\r\ntemples, and her bonnet lay on the ground beside her. Lilias gazed at\r\nher with a feeling almost of awe, wondering what was the secret of this\r\nstrange cousin's life, and a slight movement which she made awoke\r\nAletheia. Slowly the eyelids rose over those sad eyes, and revealed, as\r\nthe power of thought stole into them, a depth of pain, of mute entreaty,\r\nwhich seemed to indicate an imploring desire that she might not be\r\ncommanded to take up the burden of returning life. She tried to close\r\nthem again, but in vain; the light sleep was altogether broken, and,\r\nraising herself up, with a heavy sigh she turned a look of involuntary\r\nreproach on Lilias.\r\n\r\n\"I am so sorry I awoke you,\" said the latter, breathlessly. \"I did not\r\nmean it, indeed; you were not resting well; but I am afraid you did not\r\nwish to be awakened.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the low voice of Aletheia, which seemed ever to come from her\r\nlips without stirring them, \"for it is the only injury any one can do to\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"An injury!\" said Lilias, in her innocent surprise, \"to wake on this\r\nbright morning and beautiful world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bright and beautiful,\" said Aletheia, musingly, \"how these words are\r\nlike dreams of long, long ago. My days have no part in them now; but\r\nthink no more of having awakened me, it matters nothing; and it would\r\nhave been strange, indeed, if such as you had known how many are roused\r\nto the morning light with the one cry in their heart--'must I, must I\r\nlive again?'\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot conceive it,\" said Lilias; \"I always wish there were no night,\r\nit seems so sad to go away and shut one's eyes on all one loves and\r\nadmires.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet, believe me, to some sleep is precious--more precious even than\r\ndeath, for all it seems so like an angel of rest and mercy; the brief\r\nforgetfulness of sleep is certain, whilst in death the soul feels there\r\nis no oblivion.\"\r\n\r\nIt was to the gay, young Lilias, as though Aletheia were speaking in an\r\nunknown tongue; her unclouded spirit understood none of these things;\r\nbut in spite of her prejudice against this strange person, she felt\r\nstruck with pity as she saw her sitting there with the wet hair clinging\r\nto her cold, white cheek.\r\n\r\n\"You are very tired; I am afraid,\" she said, \"you have walked a long\r\ndistance.\"\r\n\r\nAletheia started, and the pale lips grew paler, as she exclaimed, almost\r\npassionately--\r\n\r\n\"You have been watching me!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed,\" said Lilias, distressed at the idea, \"how could you think\r\nme capable of it? I did not see you until I came into the verandah; but\r\nI guessed you had gone out early, because your clothes are all wet with\r\ndew.\"\r\n\r\nAletheia rose up.\r\n\r\n\"Lilias, you are come to live in the same house with me, and therefore\r\nis it necessary I should make to you one prayer. I do beseech you, as\r\nyou hope that men will deal mercifully with your life, grant me the only\r\nmercy they can give to mine--leave me alone; forget that I exist; live\r\nas if I did not, or were dead. I ask nothing but this, to be unmolested\r\nand forgotten.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned to go into the room as she spoke, but she was stopped by the\r\nappearance of Gabriel, who was creeping, with his quiet, stealthy step,\r\ntowards her; his blue eyes, usually so soft, glowing with the intensity\r\nof his ardent gaze. She paused and looked at him sadly.\r\n\r\n\"Gabriel, you heard what I said to Lilias just now; it is nothing new to\r\nyou; you know well and deeply what is my one desire--the petition I make\r\nto all. Why, then, will you live, as it were in my shadow--why will you\r\npersecute me?\" He made no answer, but by folding his hands in mute\r\nappeal and bowing his head humbly over them. She passed him in silence,\r\nand went into the house. He followed softly after her, and Lilias was\r\nleft alone.\r\n\r\nThe poor child drew a long breath, and felt at the moment an intense\r\ndesire to be at liberty amongst the Connaught hills again, where the\r\nthoughts and words of the rough country people seemed free and fresh as\r\nthe winds that blew there; all seemed so strange and mysterious in this\r\nhouse; she had been brought suddenly into contact with that deep human\r\npassion of which she knew nothing, and felt as if she were in the midst\r\nof some entangled web, where nothing plain or regular was to be seen.\r\nHer momentary wish to escape, however, died away, as the recollection\r\ncame upon her, borne as it were, by the wings of memory, of the one\r\nsweet haunting voice, and solemn strain. Nor was she long left to her\r\nown reflections; Sir Michael, who so rarely left his own rooms, came in\r\nsearch of her, and fairly monopolized her during the whole of the day.\r\nHe persuaded her to stay with him in his laboratory, and seemed to take\r\ninfinite pleasure in hearing her talk of all that had been joy to her in\r\nher past life.\r\n\r\nAnd truly it was a strange sight to see her in that dark little den,\r\nwith her innocent face and her fair white robes, sitting so fearlessly\r\nat the feet of the old man, telling him stories of Irish banshees, and\r\nsunny nooks in her native valley, where her nurse said the fairies\r\ndanced all night long. To hear her talk, and to have her sweet presence,\r\nwas to Sir Michael as though some fresh breeze were passing over his\r\nwithered soul; and the tones of her voice were so like those of his\r\nlong-lost brother, that at times he could dream they were side by side\r\nagain, both young, full of hope that was to bear fruit, for him at\r\nleast, in bitterest despair, and with passions yet unchained from the\r\ndepth of his heart. The first pleasure he had tasted for years was in\r\nLilias's society, and he inwardly determined to enjoy as much of it\r\nhenceforward as was possible--a resolution which we may so far\r\nanticipate as to mention he rigidly kept, to the sore discomfiture of\r\npoor little Lilias.\r\n\r\nHe had a deeper motive for it in the movement of jealousy he had\r\nwitnessed in his beautiful wife, when he took his niece in his arms the\r\nday before. Indifferent as she was to him, she was too thorough a woman\r\nto relish the idea, that the sole and undivided dominion she had\r\nmaintained over his heart was to be diminished by the entrance even of\r\nthe most natural affection. She need have had no fears; the passion of a\r\nlife was not now to be tempered by any such influence. Lilias was to him\r\nsimply an occupation for his restless mind; she preserved him from\r\nthinking, better than his chemical experiments, and, above all, she gave\r\nhim the exquisite delight of feeling that he had power to move his\r\nscornful wife even yet; so Lilias was doomed from that day to be his\r\nconstant companion.\r\n\r\nHe did not suppose she would like it, though he did not guess, as she\r\nsat by his side, how restlessly her poor little feet were longing to be\r\naway bounding on the soft, green grass; but he resolved to compensate\r\nher for her daily imprisonment by making her his heiress: a\r\ndetermination subject to any change of circumstances that might cause\r\nhim to alter it, which he did not conceal either from her or the rest of\r\nthe family.\r\n\r\nWe are anticipating, however; the first day of Lilias's probation is not\r\nyet over. Very wearily it passed, because her eager mind was bent on\r\nseeing Hubert Lyle; and not only did her uncle never mention his name,\r\nbut she found no opportunity of asking any one who and what he was, and\r\nwhere she could meet with him again. It was not till the evening that\r\nshe found the family once more assembled, and as she gazed round amongst\r\nthem all with this object in her thoughts, she felt there was but one\r\nwho inspired her with any confidence, or to whom she could speak freely.\r\nThis was Walter, with his fine frank countenance and winning smile; and\r\nshe was very glad when they found themselves accidentally alone in the\r\nmusic-room, where Sir Michael left them, after listening, with evident\r\npleasure, to her sweet voice singing like a bird in the sky.\r\n\r\nLilias turned round hastily to Walter, with such a pair of speaking\r\neyes, that he laughed gayly, and answered them at once----\r\n\r\n\"How can I help you? I see you have a great deal to say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, cousin Walter; I have been longing to speak to you; you are\r\nthe only one in all this house I am not afraid of. I want you to tell me\r\nso many things!\"\r\n\r\n\"And what things, dear Lilias? This is rather vague.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, every thing about every body, they are all so mysterious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, so they are,\" he said laughing: \"I find them so myself. I can\r\nquite fancy how you feel, like a poor little fly, caught in some great\r\nweb, and surrounded by spiders of all kinds and dimensions, each weaving\r\ntheir separate snares.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely; and now I want you to explain all the spiders to me; you\r\nmust classify them, and tell me which are venomous, and which are not,\"\r\nshe said, laughing along with him.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could,\" answered Walter, \"but they are quite beyond me--they\r\nare not in my line at all, I assure you. I never could keep a secret in\r\nmy life; but I will do my best to enlighten you. I can tell you certain\r\npeculiarities at all events. Suppose we make a sort of catechism of it;\r\nyou shall question and I shall answer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Lilias, entering into the spirit of his gayety, \"and\r\nso to begin--Why does Lady Randolph look so strangely at Sir Michael,\r\nand always seem anxious to go out of the room whenever he comes in?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because she hates him,\" replied Walter.\r\n\r\n\"How very strange; people seem to hate a good deal at Randolph Abbey;\r\nbut is it always their nearest relations, as in this case?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why no; as you proceed in your catechism I doubt not we shall have\r\noccasion to mention certain hatreds in this household, which are in no\r\nsense affected by natural ties.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well to proceed,\" said Lilias; \"why does Gabriel hour after hour keep\r\nhis eyes fixed on Aletheia, with a strange look which makes me fancy he\r\nthinks she would die if he were to cease gazing on her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he loves her,\" answered Walter.\r\n\r\n\"But she does not love him,\" exclaimed Lilias, with a woman's instinct.\r\n\r\n\"Most certainly not.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is so much I have to ask about her. Tell me why it is that she\r\nhas such imploring eyes. I never, on a human face, saw an expression of\r\nsuch mute entreaty; I saw it once in the wistful look of a poor deer\r\nwhich they killed on our Irish hills. I remember so well when it lay\r\nwounded, and the gamekeeper came near with the knife, it lifted up its\r\ngreat brown eyes with just such a dumb beseeching gaze, but that was\r\nonly for a moment. It soon died, poor thing; and with Aletheia, that\r\nmournful supplication seems stamped on her countenance, as though her\r\nvery life were to be spent in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! if you ask me about Aletheia,\" said Walter, \"I am powerless at\r\nonce. I can tell you nothing of her; she is a greater mystery in herself\r\nthan all the rest put together; this only seems plain to me, that her\r\nexistence is, for some unexplicable reason, one living agony.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I thought so I should be so angry with myself for having felt\r\nprejudiced against her, which, I confess, I have done, for a reason I\r\ncould not name to you. She is so cold and statue-like, I thought she\r\nseemed lost to all human feeling; but if it be suffering, and not\r\ninsensibility, which makes her move about amongst us as if she had been\r\ndead, and forced unwillingly to live again, I should try to overcome the\r\nsort of awe with which she has inspired me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe it matters little how you feel respecting her, for you will\r\nnever conquer her impenetrable reserve; even poor Gabriel, who seems\r\nfascinated by her to a marvellous extent, has ever struggled vainly\r\nagainst her implacable calm. It is seldom, I think, that one human being\r\ncan so lavish all his sympathies upon another, as he has done on her,\r\nwithout gaining some sign of life at least; but he tells me it is as\r\nthough the living soul within her were cased in iron; he cannot draw it\r\nout of the dungeon where she seems to have buried it, to meet even for a\r\nmoment his own ardent spirit.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I hardly wonder at this, if she does not love him,\" said Lilias.\r\n\r\n\"You mistake me,\" replied Walter: \"I do not expect that she should\r\nreturn his affection; but she seems utterly unaware of its existence;\r\nshe appears ever to be so intent in listening to some voice we cannot\r\nhear, that all human words are unheeded by her; those deep, beseeching\r\neyes of hers are ever gazing out, as though the world and all the things\r\nof it, were but moving shadows for her, because of the greatness of some\r\none thought which is alone reality to her; yet that there lives a most\r\nburning soul within that statue of ice, I can no more doubt than that\r\nthe snows of Etna hide, but do not quench its fiery heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"And does no one know the secret of her life?\" asked Lilias.\r\n\r\n\"No one, that I am aware of--none at least, now living; that her father\r\ndid, whose idol she was, I have reason to think from some remarks of Sir\r\nMichael's; he himself knows possibly somewhat more than we do, though\r\nassuredly not the real truth, nor more than some external peculiarities\r\nof her position. I have heard, however, that before she would consent to\r\ncome here, even for six months, and that with the chance of being chosen\r\nas the heiress, she made certain conditions with her uncle respecting\r\nthe liberty she was to be allowed. I presume this to refer chiefly to a\r\nstrange visit which she receives one day in every month, on which day\r\nalone I believe has any human being seen her moved.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who is this visitor?\" exclaimed Lilias.\r\n\r\n\"That is more than I can tell you; and all I know of him is that I have\r\nheard his sharp quick step, which certainly is the step of a man, going\r\nacross the hall to the library, where Aletheia receives him; and an hour\r\nor so later I have heard the same tread as he leaves the house; then\r\nthe galloping of his horse sounds for a moment on the gravel, and that\r\nis all that any one at Randolph Abbey hears of the only friend she seems\r\nto possess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does even Gabriel not know him?\"\r\n\r\n\"He may have seen him; but he does not know him, I am sure; it is quite\r\nwonderful how little knowledge he has acquired concerning Aletheia,\r\nconsidering the means he has taken to penetrate her secret--means which,\r\nI confess to you, I should have scorned to employ, even though, like\r\nhim, my dearest interests were at stake; for instance, he has actually\r\nmore than once tracked her in her mysterious morning walks.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! does she walk every day,\" said Lilias, in astonishment; \"I found\r\nher this morning lying quite exhausted in the verandah. She must have\r\nbeen to a great distance; surely she does not do the same every day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Every day, so far as I know, she does walk to precisely the same spot,\r\nand that several miles distance; it is certainly beyond her strength,\r\nfor she is often in a state of frightful exhaustion when she returns;\r\nbut even in the coldest spring mornings she used to leave the house,\r\nlong before it was light, to make this pilgrimage; it seems she wishes\r\nto avoid the observation she would incur later in the day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it was cruel of Gabriel to follow her.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was; but I think he is often maddened to find how his great love\r\ncomes beating up against the rock of her impenetrable calm, like waves\r\nupon the shore, leaving no trace behind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know,\" said Lilias, with a wondering look in her cloudless eyes,\r\n\"I think Gabriel has his mysteries too, like every one else in this\r\nstrange house. I can understand his watching Aletheia, if his whole\r\nheart is for ever turning to her, as you describe; but it is not her\r\nalone, for in the short time I have know him, I am sure he has managed\r\nto find out more about me than ever I knew myself; those soft blue eyes\r\nof his seem to look so stealthily into one's soul. I am convinced he\r\ncould tell you every thing I have done and said the whole of this day.\r\nYou know Sir Michael made me stay with him ever since morning, but I\r\nnever passed out of this room without meeting Gabriel in the passage.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I can easily believe. I always feel as if Gabriel acted in this\r\ndelectable abode the part of a cat watching innumerable mice; he has an\r\nanomalous sort of character; but one of his qualities is sufficiently\r\ndistinct, which is a very acute penetration; he can divine the most\r\nintricate affairs from the smallest possible indications. For my own\r\npart, I make not the slightest attempt to conceal my innermost thoughts\r\nfrom him; happily I have nothing to hide, but if I had, I should let him\r\nknow it at once; it would save all trouble, as he would infallibly find\r\nit out.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what do you mean by an anomalous character?\" asked Lilias.\r\n\r\n\"A sort of double nature; he seems to me to have naturally good impulses\r\non which some guiding hand has ingrafted a calculating disposition that\r\nsorely warps them; he has no control whatever over his passions, yet the\r\nmost perfect over his outward words and actions, whereby he effectually\r\nconceals them when he so pleases. Certain it is, that he has an\r\nindomitable will to which every thing else is subservient; but much of\r\nthis inconsistency of his character may be attributed to his position;\r\nhere he is the nephew of Sir Michael Randolph--the possible heir of\r\nRandolph Abbey; but he was educated by a person whom we know to be of\r\nlow station, and I believe must be equally so in mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"His mother?\" asked Lilias.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I know nothing of her, nor does he ever allude to his past life. I\r\ndo not even know where she lives; he is simply ashamed of her, I\r\npresume, and I sometimes think we should have the key-stone to Gabriel's\r\ncharacter in a violent ambition, were it not so neutralized by his not\r\nless violent love for Aletheia. Dear Lilias, why do you start so, what\r\ndo you see?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is there,\" she said, half frightened, and glancing to the open door\r\nthrough which, with his soft steps, Gabriel was gliding.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, considering whom we were speaking of,\" said Walter,\r\nlaughingly, \"it is an invariable rule, you know. Come along, Gabriel,\"\r\nhe added, turning to his cousin, \"I need not mention that we were\r\ndiscussing you, as by the simple rule of cause and effect, it was that\r\ncircumstance which produced your appearance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not by my overhearing you,\" said Gabriel, quickly.\r\n\r\n\"My dear fellow, there was not the least occasion for that; you were\r\nobeying a mysterious law, which is summarily stated in a proverb quite\r\nunfit for ears polite; but your arrival is most opportune; your services\r\nwill be very available to Lilias and myself; allow me to offer you a\r\nchair, and invest you at once with your office.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how am I to be made useful?\" said Gabriel, attempting, by a forced\r\nsmile, to sympathize in Walter's playful manner of viewing the subject.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you must know,\" and he laid an emphasis on the word _must_, for\r\nLilias's behoof, \"that Miss Lilias Randolph and I have begun a course of\r\nmoral dissection of the inhabitants of this house, in which she acts the\r\npart of a young and very inexperienced surgeon, and I that of a most\r\ngrave and potent doctor. We had just finished you off, and were\r\nproceeding to the dismemberment of the rest of the family; in this\r\ninteresting study I think you can materially assist us, seeing you have\r\nsome very sharp and subtle instrument for this species of anatomy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was not aware I possessed any such,\" said Gabriel; \"it would ill\r\nbefit me in my position to make myself a judge of any here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now don't begin to be humble and make us ashamed of ourselves. I\r\nconsider it quite an important matter to Lilias that she should know her\r\nground here so far as possible; so let us parade the remainder of our\r\ndear relations before her as fast as we can.\"\r\n\r\nA strange smile passed over Gabriel's face, as if he doubted that the\r\ngentle Lilias, and the frank-hearted Walter, would discover much\r\nconcerning that intricate ground on which they stood; but he made no\r\nremark, and simply said--\r\n\r\n\"And who stands next on the list after my unworthy self?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is for Lilias to determine; we wait your orders, lady dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are learning to speak Irish,\" she said, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"A most likely consummation,\" murmured Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I could say better things than that in Irish,\" said Walter,\r\ncoughing off the slight confusion his cousin's remark had produced; \"but\r\nyou must really tell us whom you mean to propose for our inspection, or\r\nthis council of war will last till midnight.\"\r\n\r\n\"This council for the preliminaries of war,\" said the low voice of\r\nGabriel, giving an unpleasant aspect of truth to an expression which\r\nWalter had carelessly used with no special meaning.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Lilias made no answer; the thought which had been present\r\nwith her throughout the whole of this conversation, and that which had\r\nalone, indeed, given it any interest for her, was, that she might obtain\r\nsome information respecting Hubert Lyle; yet now that the time was come\r\nwhen she must name him or lose her opportunity, she felt, in a lower\r\ndegree, something of that unwillingness to broach the subject, which we\r\nhave to mention any secret act of self-devotion. The solemn music which\r\nhad been the means of leading her into his presence; the unearthly\r\nserenity with which his soul had looked at her through those eyes that\r\nreminded her of the still waters of some unruffled lake, where only the\r\nglory of heaven is reflected; and above all, his infirmity, so meekly\r\nborne, had invested him with a sacredness in her mind which made her\r\nfeel as if it was almost a profanation to speak of him to indifferent\r\nears. With a slight trembling in the voice, which did not escape the\r\nquick perception of Gabriel, she said, \"There is yet one of whom I would\r\ninquire--Hubert Lyle.\" Both her cousins started at the name, but Gabriel\r\ninstantly repressed his astonishment, while Walter as freely gave vent\r\nto his.\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible you have heard of him already? who can have been bold\r\nenough to mention him?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I have not only heard of him, I have seen him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seen him!\" even Gabriel exclaimed at this. Lilias looked up with a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"I think he must be the most mysterious of all,\" she said, \"you seem so\r\nsurprised.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would not wonder at that if you knew more of the 'secrets of this\r\nprison-house,'\" said Walter, \"which you must know is no inapt quotation\r\nas regards Hubert Lyle, for he certainly acts, in some sense, the part\r\nof Hamlet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Without Hamlet's soul,\" said Gabriel, softly.\r\n\r\n\"Without Hamlet's madness, rather, I should say; for I cannot doubt,\r\nfrom all I have heard, that Hubert has a noble soul, though not one\r\nwhich would lead him, like the Prince of Denmark, to make to himself an\r\nidol of the principle of vengeance.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Lilias is waiting meanwhile to tell us where she saw him,\" said\r\nGabriel.\r\n\r\n\"Is it Lilias or you who are waiting?\" said Walter, laughing; \"for my\r\npart, I frankly confess that my curiosity is greatly excited, so pray\r\ntell us.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she did so at once, for there was not a thought of guile in this\r\nyoung girl's heart. She told how, in the quiet night, she had heard a\r\nsolemn voice of music that had called her spirit with an irresistible\r\nallurement; and how she had risen up and followed where it led, till it\r\nhad brought her into the presence of him of whom they spoke; but she\r\nwent no farther; she said nothing of the conversation which had drawn\r\nthose stranger souls more closely together than weeks of ordinary\r\nintercourse could have done; for she felt that Lyle had been surprised\r\ninto speaking of his private feelings; and the subject of his infirmity\r\nwas one she could not have brought herself to mention; the sympathy with\r\nwhich he had inspired her was of that nature which made her feel as\r\nsensitive as she would have done had the affliction been her own. Yet,\r\nthough she did not enter into details, the deep interest she felt for\r\nhim gave a soft tremulousness to her voice, which was duly noticed by\r\nGabriel, as he sat looking intently at her with the keen gaze which his\r\nmeek eyes knew so well how to give from under their long lashes.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said she, \"tell me who and what he is, he seems to occupy so\r\nstrange a position in this house?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not more strange than cruel,\" said Walter; \"he is the son of Lady\r\nRandolph, by her first husband; she had been engaged to Sir Michael\r\nbefore she met Mr. Lyle, who was his first cousin, but she had never\r\ncared for him, and yielded at once to the intense passion which sprung\r\nup between Mr. Lyle and herself; she married him, and from that hour Sir\r\nMichael hated him with such a hate, I believe, as this world has rarely\r\nseen. When his rival died, he transferred this miserable, bitter feeling\r\nto the son, Hubert, simply because the widow had, in like manner, turned\r\nall the deep love she had felt for the dead husband on the living\r\nson--not for his own merits, for poor Hubert has few attractions, but\r\nsolely because he bears his father's name, and looks at her with his\r\nfather's eyes. I believe she has even the cruelty to tell him so. She\r\nworships so the memory of her early love, that she will not have it\r\nthought her heart could spare any affection, even to her child, were he\r\nnot his son also. It has always seemed to me the saddest fate for her\r\nunhappy son, to be thus the object of such vehement hate, and no less\r\npowerful love, and yet to feel that he has neither deserved the one, nor\r\ngained the other, in his own person, but solely as the representative of\r\na dead man who can feel no more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miserable, indeed,\" said Lilias, folding her hands as though she would\r\nhave asked mercy for him; \"how cruel! how cruel! but his mother, how\r\ncould she marry Sir Michael when she so loved, and still loves, another?\r\nthis seems to me a fearful thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Starvation is more so,\" muttered Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\"Starvation!\" exclaimed Lilias.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Walter; \"Mrs. Lyle and her son were actually left in such\r\ndestitution at her husband's death, that she certainly married Sir\r\nMichael for no other purpose but to procure a home for herself and her\r\nchild. How it came to pass that she was in this extreme poverty, I know\r\nnot; report says that it was the result of Sir Michael's persecution of\r\nMr. Lyle in his lifetime; but I can hardly believe this of our uncle.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed,\" said Lilias.\r\n\r\n\"One thing is certain, that it sorely diminished Sir Michael's delight\r\nin marrying the woman he had loved so long, to find that he must submit\r\nto the continual presence of her son in the house; but she forced him to\r\nenter into a solemn agreement that Hubert was always to reside with\r\nthem, and he agreed, on condition that he crossed his path as seldom as\r\npossible. This part of the arrangement is almost overdone by poor Lyle,\r\nwho is, I believe, like most persons afflicted with personal infirmity,\r\nsingularly sensitive and full of delicate feeling. He never leaves his\r\nown rooms except to go to his mother's apartments, unless Sir Michael\r\nhappens to be absent, when Lady Randolph generally forces him to make\r\nhis appearance among us. I believe his only amusement is playing on the\r\norgan half the night, as you found him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do none of you ever go to see him, and try to comfort him,\"\r\nexclaimed Lilias; \"do none befriend him in all this house?\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget,\" said Gabriel, hastily, evidently desirous to prevent\r\nWalter from answering till he had spoken himself, \"that any one who\r\nsought out Hubert Lyle, and made a friend of him, would incur Sir\r\nMichael's displeasure to such a degree that he would strike him at once\r\noff the list of his heirs, and the penalty of his philanthropy would be\r\nnothing less than the loss of Randolph Abbey.\" As he said this he bent\r\nhis eyes with the most ardent gaze on Lilias, that he might read to her\r\ninmost soul the effect of his speech; but it needed not so keen a\r\nscrutiny; the indignation with which it had filled her sent the color\r\nflying to her cheek, and kindled a fire in her clear eyes seldom seen\r\nwithin them.\r\n\r\n\"And who,\" she exclaimed, \"could dare withhold their due tribute of\r\ncharity and sympathy to a suffering fellow-creature for the sake of the\r\nfairest lands that ever the world saw! who could be so base, for the\r\nlove of his own interest, as to pander to an unjust hatred, the evil\r\npassion of another, and join with the oppressor in persecuting one who\r\nis guiltless of all save deep misfortune! Can there be any such?\" she\r\nadded, in her turn fixing her gaze upon Gabriel. A triumphant smile\r\npassed over his lips; her answer seemed precisely what he had hoped it\r\nwould be; but Walter anxiously exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Pray do me the justice to believe that I would not act so, Lilias; I\r\nnever should have thought of the motive Gabriel assigned as a reason for\r\nnot visiting Hubert; but, to tell the truth, I have no desire to do so,\r\nbecause I believe him, from all I have heard, to be a poor morbid\r\nvisionary, who desires nothing so much as solitude, and with whom I\r\nshould not have an idea in common.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor should I be deterred from showing him any kindness for this reason,\r\nI trust,\" said Gabriel, with his meekest voice; \"I merely wished to\r\nplace you in possession of facts with which I thought it right you\r\nshould be acquainted in case Hubert should afford you the opportunity of\r\nintercourse which he has not granted to us; for it is one of the noble\r\ntraits of his fine character, that he will not risk our incurring Sir\r\nMichael's displeasure for his sake. He is the more generous in this,\r\nthat, from his relationship to our uncle, he would be heir-at-law after\r\nus four. But in fact I believe there exists not a more high-minded and\r\namiable man than he is, in no sense meriting the misfortunes that have\r\nfallen upon him; and his dignified, unmurmuring endurance of them could\r\nnever be attributed to insensibility, for he is singularly gifted; his\r\nwonderful musical talent is the least of his powers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Gabriel,\" said Walter, looking round in great surprise, \"I never\r\nheard you say so much in praise of Hubert before;--or, indeed, of any\r\none,\" he added, _sotto voce_.\r\n\r\n\"I know him, perhaps, better than you do,\" said Gabriel, watching, with\r\ndelight the softened expression of Lilias's face, which proved to him\r\nhow artfully his words had been calculated to produce the effect he\r\ndesired. He read in her thoughtful eyes, as easily as he would have done\r\nin a page of fair writing, how she was quietly determining in that hour\r\nthat she would seek by every means in her power to become the friend of\r\nthis unfortunate man, and teach him how sweet a solace there may be even\r\nin human sympathy, and that, all the more, because her worldly\r\nprospects would be endangered thereby. It would prove to Hubert that her\r\nfriendship had at least the merit of sincerity, since, in her humility,\r\nshe imagined it could possess no other;--but Gabriel had no time to say\r\nmore, for Sir Michael at this moment joined them, and Lilias, rising up,\r\nsaid she believed it was late, and turned to go into the other\r\ndrawing-room. Sir Michael looked sharply at the trio, and, as Walter\r\nfollowed his cousin, he turned to Gabriel with considerable irritation--\r\n\r\n\"How came you here, sir; I left those two together?\"\r\n\r\n\"They invited me to join them, or I should not have intruded,\" said\r\nGabriel, with his customary meekness, but a smile curled his lips, which\r\nhe could not repress. Sir Michael saw and understood it at once; he\r\npaused for a moment in thought, and then deciding, apparently like\r\nWalter, that it was no use to conceal any thing from Gabriel, and more\r\nadvantageous to be open with him at once, he said--\r\n\r\n\"Gabriel, understand me, if your quick eyes have divined any of my\r\nplans, it will work you no good to thwart them.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, possibly, it might avail me were I to further them,\" said the\r\nnephew, very softly.\r\n\r\n\"It might,\" said Sir Michael; \"the broad lands of Randolph Abbey could,\r\nwith little loss, furnish a handsome compensation to the person who\r\nshould assist me in placing therein, the heirs I desire to choose.\"\r\n\r\nGabriel's reply was merely a significant look of acquiescence, and the\r\nold man, bestowing on him a smile of approbation such as he had never\r\nbefore vouchsafed him, went away well pleased. He was firmly convinced\r\nthat he had enlisted in support of the plan that was already a favorite\r\none with him, the individual amongst all his heirs who he was the most\r\npositively resolved should never inherit the Abbey, both because he\r\nrather disliked him personally, and because he could not forgive him his\r\nmother's low birth. Could he have seen the sneer with which Gabriel\r\nlooked after him, he would have been somewhat unpleasantly enlightened\r\nas to the real value of the ally he had obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. THE DEAD FATHER IS MADE THE PERSECUTOR OF THE LIVING SON.\r\n\r\nVery strange was the contrast between the splendid drawing-room, blazing\r\nwith light and heat, where the Randolph family were assembled, and the\r\nsmall room in the other wing of the house which was occupied by Hubert\r\nLyle. It contained barely the furniture necessary for his use, and this\r\nwas by his own desire, for it was already sufficiently bitter to him to\r\neat the bread dealt out so grudgingly, and at least he would not be\r\nbeholden to his stepfather for more than the actual necessaries of\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nSorely against his proud mother's wish, he had chosen for his\r\nsitting-room one of the very meanest and poorest in the house, with a\r\nsingle window, low and narrow, which looked out on a deserted part of\r\nthe grounds. Hubert liked it all the better for this, as there was no\r\nflower-garden or green-house near to bring the head-gardener, with his\r\ntrim, mathematical mind, amongst the wild beauties of nature. The grass\r\nwas left in this part to come up against the very wall of the house, and\r\nthe ivy and honeysuckle which grew round the window were allowed to\r\npenetrate almost into the room. Fortunately, the noble trees which\r\nfilled the park stood somewhat apart in this place, and their arching\r\nbranches formed at this moment a sort of framework to the most glorious\r\npicture that ever is given to mortal eyes to look upon--the lucid sky of\r\nnight, filled as it were to overflowing with radiant worlds, each\r\nhanging in its own atmosphere of glory.\r\n\r\nIt was no wonder that Hubert turned from the low, dark room, so dimly\r\nlit with its single candle, to look upon this the bright landscape of\r\nthe skies. Within, the scene was certainly uninviting. The heavy deal\r\ntable, the scanty supply of chairs, the plain writing-desk, evidently\r\nmany years in use, were the only objects on which the eye could rest,\r\nexcepting a few books and a small piano, the gift of Aletheia, with\r\nwhich, greatly to his astonishment, she had presented him one day--for\r\nshe was as completely a stranger to him as she was to all the rest of\r\nthe family, and had always avoided intercourse with him as much as she\r\ndid with every one else. This thoughtful act of kindness on her part,\r\nhowever, produced no increased acquaintance between them, as she shrank\r\nfrom hearing his expressions of gratitude on that occasion, and, indeed,\r\nthey seldom met. Aletheia was never in Lady Randolph's rooms, where\r\nalone Hubert was to be met, excepting at rare intervals, when Sir\r\nMichael was absent.\r\n\r\nHubert sat now at the window; he had laid down his heavy head upon the\r\nwooden ledge, and his hands fell listlessly on his knee. He seemed full\r\nof anxious thoughts, and sighed very deeply more than once. From time to\r\ntime, apparently with a violent effort, he looked up and gazed fixedly\r\non the tranquil stars, seeming to drink in their pure glory, as though\r\nhe sought to steep his soul in this light of higher spheres; but ever a\r\nsort of trembling passed over his frame, and he would sink down again\r\noppressed and weary. This was most unlike Hubert Lyle's usual condition.\r\nHe was a man of the most ardent and sensitive feelings; but, at the\r\nsame, possessed of that moral strength and _truthfulness of soul_ which\r\ncan only belong to a great character--by this last expression, we mean\r\nthat he was what few are in this world, neither a deceiver nor deceived.\r\nHe did not deceive himself in any case, nor would he allow life to\r\ndeceive him; he saw things as they really were, and he permitted not the\r\nbright coloring of hope or imagination to deck them with false apparel;\r\nhe did not live as most men do, figuring to himself that he was as it\r\nwere the centre of the universe, and that all around him thought of him\r\nand felt for him as he did for himself. He weighed himself in the\r\nbalance not of his own self-love, but of other men's judgment, and rated\r\nhimself accordingly. Thus, in the earlier days of his maturity, he\r\nconstrained his spirit to rise up and look his position in the face. And\r\ntruly it was one which might have appalled a less feeling heart than\r\nhis.\r\n\r\nHis outward circumstances were as bitter as could well be to a\r\nhigh-minded man. He was a dependent on the grudging charity of one who\r\nabhorred him; and though he would right thankfully have gone out from\r\nthese inhospitable doors, even to starve, in preference, yet was he\r\nbound to endure existence within them, by a promise which his mother had\r\nextorted from him as a condition of their marriage, that he never would\r\nleave Randolph Abbey without her consent. This marriage he knew was to\r\nsave her from a blighting penury which was killing her; and, moreover,\r\nshe concealed from him that cruel hatred of Sir Michael, which was the\r\nonly heritage his dead father left him, and, thinking no evil, he had\r\ngiven them the promise which bound him as with an iron chain to abide\r\nunder the roof of his unprovoked enemy. But heavier even than unjust\r\nhatred was the weight upon soul and body of his own deformity; for if\r\nthe first shut up one human heart from him, and turned its power of\r\naffection to gall for his sake, the other cast him out for ever from the\r\nlove of all human kind. He knew that his unsightly frame could call\r\nforth no other feeling from them but a cold, most often a contemptuous\r\npity.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, when he looked out into the world--the dark, tumultuous,\r\nagonizing world--that very sea of human hearts, all beating up upon the\r\nstony shores of a life, against which they are for ever broken and\r\nshattered, he saw passing through the midst of it all a soft, pure\r\nlight, shedding warmth and brightness even on the dreariest scenes, and\r\ncausing men to forget all pain, and privation, and misery--a light to\r\nwhich the saddest eyes turned with a joyous greeting, and on which the\r\ngaze of the dying lingered mournfully, till the coffin-lid for ever shut\r\nit out from their fond longing. And he knew that this one blessed thing,\r\nwhich could overcome the strong, fierce evils of life, like the maid in\r\nthe pride of her purity, before whom the lion would turn and flee, was\r\ncalled Human Love in the doting hearts of men--Human Love--the one sole,\r\nunfailing joy of our merely mortal existence. And was it for him? Should\r\nhe ever have any share in it? Was its sweetness ever to be for his\r\nhungry and thirsty heart? Never! The seal was set upon him in his\r\nrepulsive appearance, that he was to be an outcast from his fellow-men;\r\nhis deformity was as a burden bound upon his back, with which he was\r\ndriven out into the wilderness, there to abide in utter solitude of\r\nsoul. The promise of life was abortive for him ere yet he had begun it.\r\n\r\nHubert Lyle understood all this at once; he saw how it stood with him,\r\nand how it was to be, on to the very door of the grave; so he folded his\r\nhands upon his breast and bowed down his head; he accepted his destiny,\r\nfor he felt that this was not the all of existence. He knew how\r\nstrangely sweet beyond the tomb shall seem all the bitterness of this\r\nlife; he saw that the earth was to be to his soul what it is to the\r\noutward eyes on a starry winter's night. We know what a contrast there\r\nis in that hour between the world above and the world below: the one\r\nlies so dark and cold, full only of black shadows and the howling of\r\nmournful winds, while the lucid sky that overhangs it, replete with\r\nbrightness and glory, teems with radiant stars, which are the type of\r\nthose eternal and glorious hopes that cluster for us on the outskirts of\r\nthe heaven of revelation. And so it was to be for him: his spirit was to\r\nwalk in this world as in a bleak and sunless desert; but it was to be\r\nfor ever canopied over with one bright and boundless thought, wherein\r\nwere set immutable and numberless, the starlike hopes of one eternity.\r\n\r\nThus was he to live, wholly independent of earth, and indifferent to it.\r\nBut no man can walk free while there are chains upon his hands and feet,\r\nand he felt that he was bound to his fellow-creatures by two ropes, as\r\nit were, of iron: the longing to love, and to be beloved. Of these he\r\nmust free himself, tearing them off his shrinking flesh as a prisoner\r\nwould his manacles. And he did so. He taught himself to look upon all\r\nhuman beings as not of his kind. Even when every nerve and fibre in his\r\nframe cried out that they were bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh,\r\nhe learned to consider them inaccessible for him as the angels in\r\nheaven. Yes, even far more; for he trusted that yet a little while, and\r\nthese holy ones should be his dear companions; and so he held communion\r\nwith them now. But with men he dared not hazard so much as to give them\r\na place in his thoughts, for he knew that the dream of their friendship\r\nwould become the longing for it, and the longing in his case must turn\r\nto agony; so it came to pass that his strong will, his stern\r\nresignation, compassed that which one might have believed well nigh\r\nunattainable to flesh and blood. He divested himself of all earthly\r\ninclinations and desires, all natural wishes and sympathies, and lived\r\nin this world as though he were utterly alone in it, and sole\r\nrepresentative of a race, differing from those angelic friends whom only\r\nhe consented to know as the living population of the universe--a\r\nsolitary being placed on this earth as in a desert place, where he was\r\ncommanded, for his own needful discipline, to abide, till the world of\r\nspirits should be revealed to him, and he entering there should find a\r\nhome and loving friends.\r\n\r\nIt was for this cause that Hubert shunned all intercourse with the\r\nRandolph family, as he did with all others--a resolution strengthened in\r\ntheir case by the generous motives Gabriel had assigned to him; for\r\nwhatever might have been the reasons of this latter for pronouncing his\r\neulogium, he had said no more than the truth in his account of his\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nWhen Hubert Lyle had gone through the mental process we have detailed,\r\nvery deep was the calm that entered into his soul. It became like the\r\npure waters of a deep still well, walled in and protected from all\r\nsights and sounds of the world without, and with the light and the glory\r\nof heaven alone mirrored within it.\r\n\r\nAnd why, then, was the quiet now gone from his heart, and the repose\r\nfrom his eyes? Why did he look up with that earnest gaze to the evening\r\nsky, as though some shadow had come over its brightness? It was because\r\nthe terror had come upon him, that the greatest enemy he ever could know\r\nin this life was about to rise up from its deathlike torpor and assail\r\nhim--even his own human nature; he felt that all those natural feelings\r\nand passions which he had crushed down deep into his heart as unto a\r\ngrave, were now stirring themselves like men that had been buried alive,\r\nand were waking in torture; they _would_ live, they were bursting the\r\ncerements of that strong heart. How were they to be beaten to death\r\nagain? There--rampant and fierce was the craving for sympathy, for love.\r\nThere, sickening in its intensity, was the yearning to give and to\r\nreceive that greatest of earthly gifts, the blessing of a mutual pure\r\naffection; the heart moulded from dust reasserted its birthright, and\r\ncried out for its kindred dust. It was not that these feelings were as\r\nyet at work with any definite object within Hubert Lyle, it was but the\r\nshadow and the prophecy of them that lay upon him, like a thick cloud\r\ncharged with lightning.\r\n\r\nAnd all this had been done by the murmur of one voice, one sweet voice,\r\nspeaking in the accents of that tender sympathy which never before had\r\nsounded in the cold, joyless region of his life, whispering hope to him.\r\nHe was not so mad as to love Lilias Randolph, whom he had seen but for\r\none half-hour, but her tenderness, her generous, loving kindness, had\r\naroused the slumbering nature within him, and he felt that were he much\r\nin contact with one so pure, so gentle, so noble, as she seemed to him,\r\nhe might come to love. Oh! how madly, how miserably to love! he, the\r\ndeformed cripple! Was not this a frenzy against which he had armed all\r\nthe powers of his being? what tyrant, what enemy could be more fearful\r\nto him than an earthly love? what would it do for him but crush and\r\ntorture him, and hold up far off the cup of this world's joy, where his\r\nparched lips could not reach, and he dying of thirst? Was it a\r\npresentiment that made him feel as if the spirit he had so chained down\r\nwere rebelling against him, and required but the master-touch of some\r\nkindly and winning child of earth to abandon itself to unutterable\r\nmadness? But, at all events, whatever were the source of this terror\r\nwhich had come upon him, whether it were a foreshadowing of future evil,\r\nor the warning of his good angel, it cannot pass unheeded. He must, with\r\na strong will, compel his spirit to realize in all the bitterness of\r\ndetail the truth of his exile from mankind, his needful isolation, as\r\ndecreed by the seal of that deformity which made him an unsightly object\r\nin their eyes.\r\n\r\nHe would force himself to remember that the music of human voices,\r\nhowever softly they might greet him, must be for him like those melodies\r\nof nature when wind and stream make the air musical, to which we listen\r\nwith pleasure, but in which we have no part; and the aspect of goodness\r\nand gentleness, so lovely in the fallen child of Adam, must be to him\r\nlike the light of a star shining far off in regions unattainable. Yet,\r\nwhile he felt within himself the courage thus to act, were he brought in\r\ncontact again with her, whose sweet face had come beaming in so\r\nstrangely on the darkness of his perpetual solitude, his very soul\r\nshrank from the struggle, and the longing so often before experienced to\r\nquit this house, where he was so unwelcome, returned upon him with\r\nredoubled force.\r\n\r\nWhilst he was still sitting thinking on these things, his head resting\r\non his clasped hands, there was a sound of rustling silks in the\r\npassage--the door opened, a measured, stately step went through the\r\nroom, and Lady Randolph stood by the side of her deformed son. He looked\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\"Dear mother, I am so glad you have come, I was wishing at this very\r\nmoment to speak to you.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an expression of displeasure and annoyance on her beautiful\r\nface as she looked at him.\r\n\r\n\"It cost me no small effort to come, I can tell you, Hubert; it is so\r\nwretched to find you here in this miserable room, with every thing so\r\nmean and neglected round you. You seem ever to do what you can to render\r\nyour own appearance uninviting, crouching down there with your matted\r\nhair and melancholy face.\"\r\n\r\nThere was little of the accents of love in these words, and a slight\r\nshiver seemed to agitate the frame of Hubert as he felt at that moment\r\nthat he was repulsive even to the mother who bore him; but he lifted his\r\ndark gray eyes to her face with the sweet, patient smile which filled\r\nhis countenance at times with a spiritual beauty, and said gently:\r\n\r\n\"I did not expect you at this hour, or I should have tried to make both\r\nmy little den and myself look more cheerful in your honor.\"\r\n\r\nThere was something in his expression which touched with an intense\r\npower a never-slumbering memory. She flung her arms round his neck and\r\nbent over him.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my Henry--my Henry--it was his eyes that looked at me just now, as\r\nthey have often looked in their tenderness, for ever perished--his eyes\r\nthat I kissed in death with my poor heart broken--broken--as it is to\r\nthis day--his eyes sealed up now with the horrible clog of his deep\r\ngrave--oh, my Henry--my Henry--come back to me!\"\r\n\r\nShe pressed the head of her son close to her beating heart and wept. He\r\nwaited till she was more composed; then, gently disengaging himself, he\r\nmade her sit down beside him, and held her hand in both his own.\r\n\r\n\"Dear mother,\" he said very gently, \"it is my father whom you love in me\r\nand not myself; when I do not wear this passing likeness of him, which\r\nat times only draws your heart to me, there remains nothing in myself to\r\nwin your affections, and you do not love me.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" she answered calmly; \"living I loved him only--dead, it is\r\nhis memory alone which I adore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I think you cannot refuse the prayer I have to make to you this\r\nday,\" said Hubert, not the least flush of indignation tinging his pale\r\ncheek at this unfeeling announcement; \"I think it cannot in truth be any\r\npleasure to you to see in me the marred and hateful resemblance of that\r\nwhich was so beautiful, and so dear; better surely to feed on his image\r\npure and unchanged in the depths of your heart, and never have it\r\nbrought so painfully before you in my miserable person.\" He paused a\r\nmoment whilst she looked wondering at him, and then, suddenly, he\r\nexclaimed, with a passionate burst of feeling, \"Mother, let me go--let\r\nme go--from this house, where my presence is abhorred by some and sought\r\nby none; nothing has kept me here but my fatal promise to you: I would I\r\nhad died ere I made it; but it will cost you nothing to part from me,\r\nand you know not what it may cost me to stay here; it is cruel to keep\r\nme--let me go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let you go! Hubert think what you are saying, you would go to starve!\"\r\n\r\n\"It matters not! better so than to live on here. Mother, you would have\r\nhad no power to detain me in this place but for that rash promise; not\r\neven your wishes should have kept me. I beseech you release me from it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\"\r\n\r\nHe almost writhed as she spoke, yet he went on--\r\n\r\n\"Do not keep me because you fancy I should starve; no man does who has\r\nenergy and perseverance. I have a head and hands to labor with, and how\r\nfar sweeter were the worst of toil than the bitter bread of charity.\"\r\n\r\n\"But do you know,\" said Lady Randolph almost fiercely, \"that I could not\r\ngive you the means of buying that bread one day, I am so utterly in Sir\r\nMichael's power. He succeeded in laying hold of me because I was\r\npoverty-stricken beyond what flesh and blood could bear, and now by the\r\nsame means he binds me down; he never has relaxed his hold; every thing\r\nis his; I could not command a shilling. These very baubles with which he\r\nloads me are not my own.\" And she tore the bracelets from her arms and\r\nflung them down. \"He calls them family jewels on purpose to keep me to\r\nthe veriest trifle in his power.\r\n\r\n\"Mother, mother,\" exclaimed Hubert, \"do you think, though he placed the\r\nwealth of millions in your hands, that I would not rather perish than\r\ntouch it; it is too much already that I have been so long indebted to\r\nhim for the roof that shelters me; but I do not fear that I could gain\r\nenough for my own living, if only you will let me go from this Egyptian\r\nbondage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hubert, what is it that has excited you in this manner? I never saw you\r\nso unlike yourself; you are usually so calm and so enduring. Was it your\r\nunfortunate meeting with Sir Michael last night? Was he more than\r\nusually insulting?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it was not that,\" said Hubert gently. \"I am so used to his bitter\r\nwords that I could not feel more pained than I have ever been; but it\r\nmatters not that you should be wearied with the detail of all the\r\nthoughts that have made me at this time so desirous to leave Randolph\r\nAbbey; dear mother, let it suffice you that I do implore you to release\r\nme from my promise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hubert, I tell you NO a thousand times. I will not see you starved to\r\ndeath for any Quixotic fancy; and, besides, do you think any power on\r\nthis earth would induce me to gratify my worst enemy, my life-long\r\nenemy, whom chiefly I hate because he has the power to call me\r\n_wife_--that dear name I so loved to hear from the beloved lips that are\r\nchoked up with dust? Do you think I would gratify him by giving him that\r\nwhich he has labored for, by the persecution of my own dearest husband,\r\neven to the death, and of myself to worse than death, a life with him?\r\nDo you know that the one thing he has always desired has been to obtain\r\npossession of me without having you for ever before his eyes as the\r\nliving monument of that buried love which was his torturer, and to which\r\nI am faithful still? And do you think that to brighten even your life,\r\nmuch less to peril it, I would grant him this his heart's desire, and\r\nput it out of my power to show him, in every caress I lavish upon you,\r\nmy poor deformed son, how I adored your father?\"\r\n\r\nHubert let her hand fall, and his features assumed an expression of\r\nseverity.\r\n\r\n\"Mother, forgive me that as your son I venture to judge you; but this is\r\nunworthy, most unworthy.\"\r\n\r\nShe seemed almost awed by his rebuke, but hastily throwing her arms\r\nround him, she said more gently:\r\n\r\n\"Hubert, forgive me; but I cannot--cannot part with you, the last\r\nshattered fragment of my ruined happiness. You do not know what it is to\r\nme to see you; to hear your voice coming to me like an echo from the\r\ngrave, telling of departed love; to find in your eyes at times a glance\r\nas from the light of the past. It was such joy, such deep, deep joy when\r\nhe lived, and my happiness was hid in his true heart, that often I think\r\nI never, never could have been so blest: and in truth that it is all a\r\ndream, too unutterably sweet to have been true; life seems to faint\r\nwithin me at that thought, for it is something to feel, barren and\r\ndesolate as my existence is now, that I _have_ loved and been loved as\r\nonce I was; and, Hubert, it is your presence alone that makes all this\r\nreality to me. His kiss has been upon your lips--his voice has called\r\nyou his dear son. Ah! take not from me those last relics of him.\"\r\n\r\nShe laid her head upon his breast in a passion of weeping. He raised her\r\ntenderly, and said with a calm voice:\r\n\r\n\"Mother, it is not my vocation in this world to give pain to others for\r\nthe sake of my own will or pleasure: take comfort, I will never more\r\ntrouble you concerning this matter; I will not ask again to leave you.\"\r\n\r\nSilently she pressed her lips to his forehead, and then, as if ashamed\r\nthat even her own son should have seen her so moved, she rose up without\r\nspeaking and left the room.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] Continued from page 387.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Bentley's Miscellany.\r\n\r\nSEQUEL TO THE JEWISH HEROINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA magnificent saloon, dazzling with oriental splendor, and brilliant\r\nwith Arabic decorations, was allotted to Sol's reception; and there she\r\nwas immediately attended by six Moorish damsels, who came to receive her\r\norders. Fatigued by the length of her journey, and covered with the dust\r\nof the road, she begged for water to refresh herself, and a room where\r\nshe might repose. Scarcely were the words pronounced when she beheld\r\naround her vessels of silver, brought to her by six other damsels,\r\nclothed in white, and offering her that for which she had asked with\r\nrespect and humility. They brought her clothes of the finest cambric,\r\nfragrant essences of Arabia, and exquisitely-worked garments of divers\r\ncolors, and of the highest value, all of which the humble Sol rejected,\r\nscarcely accepting from them even those things which were indispensable\r\nto her, and declining to change her dress. But one of the ladies of the\r\ncourt, seeing this, told her that she had received orders to clothe her\r\naccording to the custom of the country, for which purpose she had\r\ncollected together these garments for her choice. Sol, nevertheless,\r\nafter expressing her gratitude, endeavored to excuse herself, but the\r\nrequest was pressed upon her with so much urgency, that she found it\r\nimpossible to decline; and, at length, among the many varieties of dress\r\nprepared for her express use, selected one of a black hue, bordered with\r\nwhite, as indicative of the sadness of her heart; when, after a place of\r\nrest had been pointed out to her, she was left alone.\r\n\r\nAll the women who had been employed about the young Hebrew repeated to\r\nthe wives of the imperial prince the warmest praises of her extreme\r\nbeauty and amiability. The emperor himself visited the house of his son,\r\nand inquiring with minute curiosity into all the incidents that have\r\nbeen related, and listening with delight to the praises heaped upon his\r\nyoung captive, he renewed his commands that she should be treated with\r\ngentleness, that every thing which could flatter her sight, or gratify\r\nher wishes, should be given her, and that nothing should be denied her\r\nby which her mind could be favorably impressed previously to the\r\ninterview which he proposed to have with her on the day\r\nfollowing,--saying, as he departed, that the moment of her conversion by\r\nhis means would be an epoch in his life, which he would mark by the most\r\nprincely magnificence to all that had contributed to it. All promised\r\nthe most punctual compliance with the commands of the emperor and the\r\nprince, and all vied with one another in inventing every expedient to\r\neffect the object which the most subtle arts could have recourse to.\r\nDuring the night the wearied maiden slept profoundly, while the Moorish\r\nwomen in attendance watched her in silence, anxious not to disturb her\r\nslumbers, and not venturing to move from their posts.\r\n\r\nMorning dawned at last. The nightingale, the goldfinch, and the\r\nswift-flying bunting, announced the rising of the orb of day; the\r\nflowers unclosed their buds in the transparent morning ray, wafting\r\nforth their delicious odors, and perfuming with their fragrance the\r\ntranquil abode where breathed this innocent and lovely maiden. This\r\nabode was within a small gallery, decorated with crystal; and surrounded\r\nby vast shrubberies of the laurel, cypress, and myrtle, whose dark\r\nfoliage mingled with the fragrant boughs of the citron and lemon.\r\nThrough occasional vistas might be remarked, amid these labyrinths of\r\neternal green, the deep mulberry-colored branches of the towering\r\nspice-tree, while the rose, the jessamine, and the mallow, crowned the\r\nraised terraces in sweet luxuriance, seeming to vie with the tall\r\ncassia, and darkening the bowers where the sunlight had been allowed to\r\npenetrate by the abundance of their white and crimson bloom. The\r\nblue-bell, the white lily, and the lily of the valley, blossomed\r\nbeneath, shedding their perfume on the lower earth, as though too lowly\r\nto mingle with the clouds of fragrance emitted by the loftier plants,\r\nabove which in their turn the ambitious woodbine exalted its gay\r\nfestoons; and in the more distant shades of the garden, the green sward\r\nspread a soft and variegated carpet over the ground, spangled with\r\nplants of the dwarf violet, and aromatic spikenard. It was upon these\r\nscenes that the eyes of the fair Hebrew unclosed, after her long and\r\nprofound sleep. So fair a sight filled her with a tranquil and serene\r\npleasure; the warbling of the singing birds that fluttered amid the\r\nbranches around her, or flew here and there amid the flowery mazes of\r\nthe garden, were heard with delight, and while she watched them she\r\nenvied them their liberty.\r\n\r\nIt was with surprise and admiration that the young Jewess examined the\r\nembellishments of this gallery, which were, indeed, a triumph of art and\r\ningenuity. Again and again did she admire it, reclining on her couch.\r\nOne of the Moorish ladies, seeing her attention thus engaged, addressed\r\nher, with an affectionate salutation. Sol replied in accents of\r\nkindness, and entered into conversation with her, speaking with innocent\r\nadmiration of the picturesque beauty of the landscape she beheld from\r\nthis gallery.\r\n\r\nA black slave, clothed in white, came to give notice to Sol that the\r\nkaidmia[9] waited to receive her. With haste, therefore, she took leave\r\nof the Moorish ladies, and placed herself under the conduct of that\r\nofficer. She was at once conducted into the presence of the emperor, who\r\nreceived her in a magnificent hall, sitting on an ottoman of crimson\r\nvelvet, richly fringed with gold. Opposite to him was a cushion, which\r\nhe desired the young Hebrew to occupy, and commanded his slaves to serve\r\n_esfa_,[10] and tea with the herb _luisa_.[11] Having thus, by every\r\ndemonstration of kindness and affability, prepared her to converse with\r\nhim--the emperor told Sol, he had long since heard of her mental\r\nacquirements and talents, and was not ignorant of the arguments she had\r\nused in the palace of his son, nor of her obstinate refusal to embrace\r\nthe Law of the Prophet; but that he looked upon that merely as a morbid\r\nfeeling of her mind, arising from delusion, and trusted that when _he_\r\nshould have argued awhile with her, she would not long continue in her\r\npresent opinion.\r\n\r\n\"Thou art called Sol,\" proceeded the emperor, \"is it not so?\"\r\n\r\nThe young Jewess replied in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, beloved Sol,\" said he, \"I have prepared a boon beyond all\r\nthe powers of thine imagination to conceive. Since first I heard of thy\r\nbeauty and virtue from Arbi Esid, the governor of Tangier, I decided\r\nthat thou shouldst become the enchantress of my court. I saw thee enter\r\nFez; and was delighted with all I saw; I heard thee speak in the palace\r\nof my son, and was charmed with all I heard. I was beside thee, though\r\nunseen, and I rejoiced with the Prophet, over so fair a captive. This\r\nmorning, while thou wast conversing upon the state of men by birth, I\r\nwas in the garden; the Tolva,[12] who accompanied me, said to me, 'this\r\nJewess will indeed be a noble Mahometan!' At that moment, I had decided\r\nto reward thy beauty by giving thee in marriage to my nephew,--a\r\nhandsome, rich, and brave youth; I had determined to bestow upon thee a\r\ndiamond, whose value exceeds all the riches that any prince can possess;\r\nsee, beautiful Sol, these are indeed gifts worthy to be appreciated, and\r\nthou wilt not, I am certain, disappoint me.\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" replied Sol, \"I must confess, that in my present condition,\r\nnothing can attract or fix my attention: and my mind is tormented by the\r\nremembrance of my parents and of my brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thy parents and thy brother,\" said the emperor, \"shall be sent for\r\nimmediately after thy recantation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say, rather,\" exclaimed Sol, \"after my death, for never can I become a\r\nMahometan!\"\r\n\r\n\"Innocent creature!\" said the emperor, \"who has urged you to this\r\ntemerity? Reflect but for an instant; then consider if you would\r\nrenounce my favor, and embrace Death as an alternative! Resolve quickly;\r\nor I would even grant delay, if you desire it.\"\r\n\r\n\"My Lord,\" said Sol, \"I am well aware that you have distinguished me in\r\na manner of which I am undeserving; the offers that you have made me\r\nare, indeed, worthy of so great a prince; but I, a miserable Jewess,\r\ncannot accept them. I have determined never to change my creed; if this\r\nresolve should merit death, I will patiently submit; order, then, my\r\nexecution, and the God of justice, knowing my innocence, will avenge my\r\nblood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unhappy girl!\" exclaimed the emperor; \"you were not born to be so\r\nbeautiful, yet so unfortunate! From this moment I abandon you: my pride\r\nforbids me to persuade you further; yet I leave you with sorrow--the\r\nlaws of my realm must judge you, and already I foresee that your blood\r\nwill be poured out upon the earth!\"\r\n\r\nSo speaking, and casting a compassionate glance upon Sol, the monarch\r\ndeparted with a measured and thoughtful step.\r\n\r\nThe afflicted Sol remained immovable, but gave way to a torrent of\r\ntears. Before long the kaidmia appeared and desired her to follow him,\r\nwhich she did without opposition. The emperor, although he had decreed\r\nthat the cadi, as superior judge of the law, should try her cause, had\r\nurged upon him to withhold the extreme penalties of the law till every\r\nmeans had been tried that persuasion and mildness could suggest. To the\r\nhouse of this magistrate she was now conducted, with this especial\r\nrecommendation from the emperor, in consequence of which, instead of\r\nbeing sent to the prison, a room in the cadi's own house was set apart\r\nfor her, where he could be near her continually, and frequently engage\r\nher in conversation; yet all these marks of kindness did the young Sol\r\nreceive as part of her martyrdom, and now thought on nothing but death,\r\nas the means of her wished-for release.\r\n\r\nThe Jew who had accompanied the captive maiden at the request of her\r\nparents, had written news of all these events to Tangier. In Fez they\r\nexcited a very great sensation; and, especially among the resident Jews,\r\nwho showed their interest in all that passed whenever they could do so\r\nwithout injuring the success of the means devised to save the victim, of\r\nwhich they never lost sight for a moment. But they were now, although\r\nthey knew it not, engaged in a hopeless undertaking; for the Moors had\r\nentered into a compact, having for its object the conversion of Sol, and\r\nfrom this there was no escape. The cadi, a zealous servant of the\r\nemperor, conducted his task with masterly subtlety; six hours were\r\nalmost daily occupied by him in arguments and entreaties to the young\r\nJewess; but all was vain, the steadfast maiden, firm in her resolution,\r\nadhered to the law of her fathers, and listened with reluctance to all\r\nthe exhortations of the cadi. He admired her fortitude of spirit, while\r\nhe pitied her fate, knowing that unless she became a proselyte, her\r\nsentence must inevitably be pronounced. In order to hasten the crisis,\r\nhowever, he concerted a scheme to surprise her into a decision by which\r\nshe might either escape, or fall into his snare.[13]\r\n\r\nOne morning early, after nine days had been spent in useless persuasion,\r\nthe cadi entered the apartment of Sol: \"My daughter,\" said he, \"I bring\r\nyou news of consolation; I, that have beheld you with eyes of\r\ncompassion, that would weep over your death as for that of a daughter,\r\nhave sought the Jajamins[14] of your creed; with them I have considered\r\nyour present position; they assure me that your fear of forfeiting the\r\nglories which are to come, which causes you to reject the laws of the\r\nProphet, is groundless; they ensure you that future glory, on the word\r\nof their conscience, provided that your life is not thus forfeited. I\r\nwish the emperor to remain unacquainted with the step I have thus taken\r\nfor your sole benefit, my dear daughter, and from motives of kindness\r\nand affection only. You will be visited by the Jajamins, who will repeat\r\nwhat you now hear from my lips; and thus, convinced of the truth, you\r\nwill give me the delight of your conversion, and of your rescue from\r\ndeath. But I perceive you are but little affected by this news!\"\r\n\r\nSol had not ceased, during this conversation, to regard the cadi with a\r\nserious expression of countenance, which very clearly indicated the\r\nstate of mental vacillation produced by his words; nevertheless, she\r\nanswered only, that she was beyond measure anxious to speak to the\r\nJajamins, on whose judgment would probably depend her final\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\nNow this plot, so far from being undertaken without the knowledge of the\r\nemperor, had been concerted between himself and the cadi; and by his\r\ndesire the latter informed the Jajamins, that unless they succeeded in\r\nthe conversion of the young Hebrew, she would suffer death, and they\r\nwould be exposed to the emperor's rigorous displeasure. This threat\r\nproduced the desired effect upon the Jajamins, who came to Sol prepared\r\nby every means in their power to change her resolution.\r\n\r\nOn the ensuing day, when she received their visit, they professed to her\r\ntheir wish to console her in her affliction, and to hear from her own\r\nlips the reasons why she had negatived the urgent wishes of the emperor;\r\nadding, that this mission was a part of their duty, to which they much\r\ndesired to conform.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful Jewess listened with attention to this exordium; and\r\nreplied, though with many sighs, in the following terms:--\"God, who was\r\nconcealed from our view by the dense cloud which no human sight could\r\npenetrate, delivered the Tables of the Law to Moses on the Mountain of\r\nthe Desert. He prompts my heart to remain faithful to those laws,\r\nimposed on the people of Israel. More than once have I read in those\r\nsacred books of the horrible persecutions endured by the Israelites who\r\nviolated that law; I have studied the prophecies of our Patriarchs, and\r\nhave observed their gradual fulfilment. Mahomet was but a false\r\ninnovator, a renegade from the primitive law;[15] neither to his laws\r\nnor to the future pleasures of his paradise, can I lend an ear; faithful\r\nto my own rites, the name of the only true God remains engraven on my\r\nheart; to whom Abraham offered his son Isaac in sacrifice; and I, a\r\ndaughter of Abraham, would make sacrifice of my life to the same God. He\r\nordains fidelity, and I will keep His commandments as a faithful Hebrew\r\nought to keep them. Can any one on earth oppose the decree written by\r\nthe right hand of the Most High?\"\r\n\r\nThe Jajamins listened attentively to the reasons of the youthful Sol,\r\nand urged, in reply, arguments full of hope; but perceiving that Sol,\r\nwith an indescribable firmness, set these all aside, one of them at\r\nlength addressed her as follows: \"Our law imposes on us, as a duty,\r\nafter God, to respect the king. The king's will is that you should wear\r\nthe turban; and his will is sacred upon earth. I dare not advise\r\notherwise, for I should then lift up my counsel against the law of the\r\ncountry that gives us a home. Besides, there are certain circumstances\r\nof human life which are of such exigency, that the God of Abraham looks\r\nupon them with leniency and toleration. As, for instance, young maiden,\r\nthe unforeseen and impending danger of your present situation. You have\r\nparents--a brother; Jews, in great numbers, reside in this vast empire;\r\nand all these will, on your account, be exiled, persecuted, and\r\nill-used. While, on the contrary, your conversion will not only liberate\r\nyourself from death, but will avert these threatening ills to them, and\r\nwill bring down upon them honors and privileges; and we will, in the\r\nname of God, insure your future glory, and save your conscience, by\r\ntaking on ourselves the responsibility of the act.\"\r\n\r\nThe young Jewess listened in expressive silence, but without any visible\r\nemotion, to the foregoing address. At the close of it she arose, and\r\nexpressed herself thus:\r\n\r\n\"I respect your words, wise men of our faith; but if our laws impose\r\nrespect--after God, to the king--the king cannot violate the precepts of\r\nthe One God. I am resolved to sacrifice my life on the altar of my\r\nfaith. To myself only can this resolve be fatal: my parents and kindred\r\nwill be strengthened, and protected, and freed from the fury of that\r\nfanaticism by which I suffer. I will not, even in outward appearance,\r\naccede to the terms proposed. I will lay down my head to receive the axe\r\nof the executioner, and the remembrance of my death and constancy will\r\nexcite only remorse in those who have oppressed me. Pardon me, if I have\r\noffended you; and, I pray you, tell my parents that they live in my\r\nheart. Entreat the cadi to molest me by no further importunities. My\r\ndetermination is fixed, and all further attempts to shake it will be\r\nvain.\"\r\n\r\nThe tone of firmness in which she spoke convinced the jajamins that\r\nthere was no hope; and they left her, overwhelmed with surprise.\r\n\r\nThe cadi, who had listened to the whole conference from another\r\napartment, went to meet the anxious and unsuccessful jajamins.\r\n\r\n\"I know all,\" said he; \"I have heard every thing. Your mission is\r\nfulfilled, and I shall report your fidelity to the emperor. Fear\r\nnothing, therefore, but rely upon my word.\"\r\n\r\nHe then dismissed them, and going at once to his office, he took the\r\npapers that related to the cause of the young Sol, and added to them a\r\ntranscript of her late contumelious expressions respecting the Law of\r\nthe Prophet, which he represented as being blasphemed by her, and\r\nsentenced her, in consequence, to public execution. He next repaired to\r\nthe palace of the emperor, and after reporting to him the result of the\r\nlate conference with the jajamins, he handed to him the sentence of\r\ndeath. The emperor was much moved, and showed symptoms of surprise and\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\n\"How!\" said he; \"is there no remedy? Must this Jewess die?\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" answered the cadi, \"by the law she stands condemned; and\r\nthere is no remedy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" said the emperor, \"but one more hope remains. I command\r\nthat preparations for the execution be made with the utmost publicity;\r\nthat all the troops of Fez, and at the intermediate stations, be\r\nassembled, and that nothing may be omitted which can make the spectacle\r\nan imposing one. Let her be awe-stricken; let her even be partially\r\nwounded before her head be finally severed. Perchance the sight of her\r\nown blood, flowing down, may produce some effect upon her, and we may,\r\nat the last moment, accomplish her conversion by intimidation. Leave me;\r\nI am sorely displeased at the fate of this young Hebrew--lovely as her\r\nname. And, mark me, strain every point, neglect nothing. We may yet gain\r\nher over. Alas! may Ala protect her!\" And the emperor turned away with\r\nmanifest signs of heavy displeasure.\r\n\r\nThe cadi well perceived how greatly his royal master was grieved at the\r\nidea of Sol's death: but there was now no remedy. The law, barbarous and\r\nunjust as it was, was final; and her death was, therefore, inevitable.\r\nBefore her execution, nevertheless, he paid her a final visit, when he\r\nfound her kneeling in prayer, and displayed to her the writ of\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\n\"Behold,\" said he, \"your sentence. Your head will roll on the ground,\r\nand the dust of the earth shall be dyed with your blood. Your tomb shall\r\nbe covered with maledictions, and amidst them will your last end be\r\nremembered. Yet, fair Sol, there is a remedy; think yet upon it.\r\nTo-morrow, at this very hour, I will return, either to present you,\r\ncrowned with the jessamine flowers, to the emperor, or to lead you to\r\nyour death.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words he departed, leaving the young Hebrew still in the\r\nposition in which he had found her upon his entrance, and from which she\r\nstirred not, but remained in a contemplative ecstasy commending her soul\r\nfervently to her Creator.\r\n\r\nIt was soon publicly known in Fez that the day approached when the\r\nbeautiful young Jewess was to be beheaded for blaspheming the name of\r\nthe Prophet. The Moors, whose religious fanaticism is great beyond\r\ncomparison, looked upon this execution as an occasion for rejoicings.\r\nThe Jews, powerless to remedy it, were overcome by the deepest feelings\r\nof despondency: unwilling to remain entirely passive, they commenced a\r\nsubscription, ready to be invested in any way that might best suit the\r\nemergency. The parents and relations, who were in Tangier, whose efforts\r\nto save this beloved victim would have been unavailing, even had they\r\nbeen capable of devising any means for her rescue, were plunged into\r\ndespair; their hopes had suffered shipwreck upon the rock of a\r\nrelentless fatality, and they, like the young maiden herself, had no\r\nconsolation but those imparted from heaven. The afflicted Sol spent the\r\nwhole day in meditation, she refused all food, and looked anxiously for\r\nthe hour which would end her life. That fatal hour arrived at length.\r\nWith a trembling step, the cadi entered her apartment, and found her, as\r\nbefore, in prayer. He was much agitated, and could speak to her only\r\nwith the utmost difficulty. At length he said:--\r\n\r\n\"Sol--beautiful Sol! the arbiters of life and death may meet together.\r\nBehold me here! Know you wherefore I am come?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do know it,\" replied the maiden.\r\n\r\n\"And have you determined upon your fate?\" asked the cadi.\r\n\r\nRising from the ground, and with firmness, Sol answered:--\"I have\r\ndetermined. Lead me to the place where I am to shed my blood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unhappy girl!\" said the cadi, \"never, till my death, will thine image\r\nleave my memory!\" He then desired a soldier to handcuff and lead her to\r\nthe prison.\r\n\r\nThe authorities of Fez, at the emperor's desire, having determined to\r\ngive the scene as much publicity as possible, resolved that the\r\nexecution should take place upon the Soco--a large square in Fez, where\r\nthe market is held. The previous day, too, having been one of the weekly\r\nmarket days, when the concourse of persons was always very considerable,\r\nthe news had circulated far and wide, and but little else was talked of.\r\nVery early in the morning, a strong picquet of soldiers had been posted\r\non the Soco, in order to excite attention, and attract more spectators;\r\nbut so numerous was the crowd that this precaution was scarcely\r\nnecessary. The Jews who resided in Fez, when they saw that hope was at\r\nan end, went to the emperor and proffered the large sum they had\r\ncollected, as was previously stated, in exchange for the permission to\r\ninter the remains of the young Sol after her execution; to which the\r\nemperor offered no opposition.\r\n\r\nThe dreadful moment had now arrived, when the fair victim was to be\r\nconducted from her prison to the place of execution. Till it arrived,\r\nher devotions had been uninterrupted, and the executioners, sent to\r\nfetch her, found her still praying to that Eternal Being in whom her\r\nfaith was centred, that He would endow her with strength and fortitude\r\nto receive the bitter cup that awaited her. When the door of her prison\r\nopened, she saw the executioners enter without manifesting any emotion\r\nor surprise, but looked meekly towards them, waiting for the fulfilment\r\nof their mission. But these men, whose nature is hardened to the most\r\nsavage cruelty, after intimating to her that they were come to conduct\r\nher to death, tied around her neck a thick rope, by which they commenced\r\ndragging her along as though she were a wild beast. The lovely young\r\ngirl, wrapped in her haique,[16] her eyes fixed on the earth, which she\r\nmoistened with her bitter tears, followed them with faltering steps. As\r\nshe passed, compassion, grief, tenderness, and every painful emotion of\r\nthe heart, might be traced in the countenances of the Jews; but among\r\nthe Mahometans there were no visible relentings of humanity. The Moors,\r\nof all sects and ages, who crowded the streets, rent the air with their\r\ndiscordant rejoicings. \"She comes!\" they cried; \"she comes, who\r\nblasphemed the name of the Prophet. Let her die for her impiety!\"\r\n\r\nFrom the prison to the Soco, the crowds every minute augmented, though\r\nthe square formed by the troops prevented their penetrating to the\r\nscaffold. Every alley and lane was crowded, and amid the most extreme\r\nconfusion the executioner arrived with Sol at the appointed spot. The\r\npen refuses to describe the incidents of the few succeeding moments.\r\nSome few, even amongst the Moors, were moved, and wept freely and\r\nbitterly. The executioner[17] unsheathed his sharp scimetar, and whirled\r\nit twice or thrice in the air, as a signal for silence, when the uproar\r\nof the Moors was hushed. The beautiful Sol was then directed to kneel\r\ndown,--at which moment she begged for a little water to wash her hands.\r\nIt was immediately brought, when she performed the ablution required by\r\nthe Jewish custom before engaging in prayer. The spectators were\r\nanxiously observant of all the actions of the victim. Lifting her eyes\r\nto heaven, and amid many tears, she recited the Sema (the prayer offered\r\nby those of her nation before death), and then, turning to the\r\nexecutioners, \"I have finished,\" said she, \"dispose of my life;\" and,\r\nfixing her gaze upon the earth, she knelt to receive the fatal stroke.\r\n\r\nThe scene had by this time begun to change its aspect. The vast\r\nconcourse of people, seeing Sol's meek gentleness, could not but be\r\nmoved; many wept, and all felt a degree of compassion for her faith. The\r\nexecutioner, then, seizing the arms of the victim, and twisting them\r\nbehind her back, bound them with a rope, and whirling his sword in the\r\nair, laid hold of the long hair of Sol's head, and wounded her slightly,\r\nas he had been commanded, yet so that the blood flowed instantly from\r\nthe wound, dyeing her breast and garments.\r\n\r\nBut Sol, turning her face to the cruel executioner, replied--\r\n\r\n\"There is yet time,\" said they to her; \"be converted, your life may yet\r\nbe spared.\"\r\n\r\n\"Slay me, and let me not linger in my sufferings; dying innocently, as I\r\ndo, the God of Abraham will judge my cause.\"\r\n\r\nThese were her last words, at the close of them the scimetar descended\r\nupon her fair neck, and the courageous maiden was no more.\r\n\r\nThe Jews had paid six Moors to deliver to them the corpse with the\r\nblood-stained earth on which it lay, immediately after the execution of\r\nthe sentence. This was accordingly done, and the remains, wrapped in a\r\nfine linen cloth, were deposited in a deep sepulchre of the Jewish\r\ncemetery by the side of those of a learned and honored sage of the law\r\nof Moses. Amidst tears and sighs was the Hebrew martyr buried. Even some\r\nof the Moors followed her, mourning to her grave, and still visit her\r\ntomb, and venerate her resting place as that of a true and faithful\r\nmartyr to the creed she held.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] Or \"captain of a hundred,\" centurion.

The cadi\r\ncould not, therefore, condemn Sol to death, because she refused to\r\nbecome a Mahometan, unless she had made use of some expressions\r\nimpugning the law of Mahomet.

He received his education first at the\r\nbarony school of Wandon, and afterwards under the care of Mr. Wilson, a\r\nteacher of considerable local celebrity at Crawford, one of the wildest\r\nspots in the Southern Highlands. He was subsequently apprenticed to Mr.\r\nWilliam Baillie, in Biggar; and in 1766 proceeded, for the completion of\r\nhis professional training, to the university of Edinburgh, at that time\r\nillustrated and adorned by the genius and learning of such men as the\r\nMonros, the Cullens, and the Blacks.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing his studies at this favored abode of science and literature,\r\nyoung Jackson is said to have evinced all that purity of morals and\r\nsingleness of heart which characterised him in after-life, and to have\r\nresisted the allurements of dissipation by which, in those days\r\nespecially, the youthful student was tempted to wander from the paths of\r\nvirtuous industry. His circumstances were, however, distressingly\r\nnarrow; and not only was he forced to forego the means of professional\r\nimprovement open only to the more opulent student; but in order to meet\r\nthe expenses of the winter-sessions, he was obliged to employ the\r\nsummer, not in the study but in the practice of his profession. He\r\nengaged himself as medical officer to a Greenland whaler, and in two\r\nsuccessive summers visited, in that capacity, \"the thrilling regions of\r\nthick-ribbed ice;\" returning on each occasion with a recruited purse and\r\na frame strengthened and invigorated by exposure and exercise. During\r\nthese expeditions he occupied his leisure with the study of the Greek\r\nand Roman languages, and the careful and repeated perusal of the best\r\nauthors in both.\r\n\r\nHis third winter-sessions at Edinburgh having passed away, he was\r\ninduced to go out and seek his fortune in Jamaica, and accordingly\r\nproceeded thither in a vessel commanded by one Captain Cunningham, who\r\nhad previously been employed as master of a transport at the siege of\r\nHavannah. It is far from improbable that it was from his conversations\r\nwith this individual that Jackson derived those hints, of which at a\r\nfuture time he availed himself, respecting the transmission of troops by\r\nsea without injury to their health; but it is quite certain his\r\nconviction of the enormous value of cold-water affusions as a curative\r\nagent in the last stage of febrile affections, was imbibed from this\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nArriving in Jamaica, he in 1774 became assistant to an eminent general\r\npractitioner at Savana-la-Mar, Dr. King, who was also in medical charge\r\nof a detachment of the first battalion of the 50th regiment. This latter\r\nhe consigned to Jackson's care; and well worthy of the trust did our\r\nyoung adventurer, though but twenty-four years of age, approve\r\nhimself--visiting three or four times a day the quarters of the troops\r\nto detect incipient disease, and studying with ardor and intelligent\r\nattention the varied phenomena of tropical maladies. Four years thus\r\npassed profitably away, and they would have been as pleasant as\r\nprofitable, but for one circumstance. The existence of slavery and its\r\nconcomitant horrors, appears to have made a deep impression on Jackson's\r\nmind, and, at last, to have produced in him such sentiments of disgust\r\nand abhorrence, that he resolved on quitting the island altogether, and,\r\nas the phrase is, trying his luck in North America, where the\r\nrevolutionary war was then raging. This resolution--due perhaps, as much\r\nto his love of travel as to the motive assigned--was not altogether\r\nunfortunate, for shortly after his departure, October 3, 1780,\r\nSavana-la-Mar was totally destroyed, and the surrounding country for a\r\nconsiderable distance desolated, by a terrible hurricane and sweeping\r\ninroad of the sea, in which Dr. King, his family and partner, together\r\nwith numbers of others, unhappily perished.\r\n\r\nThe law of Jamaica forbade any one to leave the island without having\r\ngiven previous notice of his intention, or having obtained the bond of\r\nsome respectable person as security for such debts as he might have\r\noutstanding. Jackson, when he embarked for America, had no debts\r\nwhatever, and was, moreover, ignorant of the law, with whose\r\nrequirements therefore he did not comply. Nor did he become aware of his\r\nmistake until, when off the easternmost point of the island, the master\r\nof the vessel approached him and said: \"We are now, sir, off\r\nPoint-Morant; you will therefore have the goodness to favor me with your\r\nsecurity-bond. It is a mere legal form, but we are obliged to respect\r\nit.\" Finding this \"legal form\" had not been complied with, the master\r\nthen, in spite of Jackson's protestations and entreaties, set him on\r\nshore, and the vessel continued on her voyage. What was to be done?\r\nAlmost penniless, landed on a part of the coast where he knew not a\r\nsoul, Jackson well-nigh gave himself up to despair. There was a vessel\r\nfor New-York loading, it was true, at Lucea; but Lucea was 150 miles\r\ndistant, on the westernmost side of the island, and not to be reached by\r\nsea, whilst our adventurer's purse would not suffer him to hire a horse.\r\nNo choice was left him but to walk, and that in a country where the\r\nexigencies of the climate make pedestrianism perilous in the extreme to\r\nthe white man. Having reached Kingston, which was in the neighborhood,\r\nin a boat, and obtained the necessary certificate, he started on his\r\ndangerous expedition, and on the first day walked eighteen miles, being\r\nsheltered at night in the house of a benevolent planter. The next day he\r\npushed on for Rio Bueno, which he had almost reached, when, overcome by\r\nthirst, he stopped by the way to refresh himself, and imprudently\r\nstanding in an open piazza exposed to a smart easterly breeze, whilst\r\nhis lemonade was preparing, contracted a severe chill that almost took\r\nfrom him the power of motion, and left him to crawl along the road\r\nslowly and with pain, until he reached his destination.\r\n\r\nHaving finally arrived, friendless and moneyless, in New-York, then in\r\nthe occupation of the British, he endeavored first to obtain a\r\ncommission in the New-York volunteers, and afterwards employment as mate\r\nin the Naval Hospital. In his endeavors, he was kindly assisted by a\r\nJamaica gentleman, a fellow-passenger, whose regard during the voyage he\r\nhad succeeded in conciliating by his amiable manners and evident\r\nabilities; but his efforts were all in vain, and poor Jackson, familiar\r\nwith poverty from childhood, began now to experience the misery of\r\ndestitution. In truth, starvation stared him in the face, and a sense of\r\ndelicacy withheld him from seeking from his Jamaica friend the most\r\ntrifling pecuniary assistance. In this, his state of desperation, he\r\ndetermined upon passing the British lines, and endeavoring to obtain\r\namongst the insurgents the food he had hitherto sought in vain;\r\nresolving, however, under no circumstances to bear arms against his\r\nnative country. Whilst moodily and slowly walking towards the British\r\noutposts to carry into execution this scheme, having in one pocket a\r\nshirt, and in another a Greek Testament and a Homer, he was met half-way\r\nby a British officer, who fixed his eyes steadily on him in passing.\r\nJackson in his agitation thought he read in the glance a knowledge of\r\nhis purpose and a disapprobation of it. Struck by the incident, he\r\nturned back, and, after a moment's reflection, resolved on offering\r\nhimself as a volunteer in the first battalion of the 71st regiment\r\n(Sutherland Highlanders), then in cantonment near New-York. Arriving at\r\nthe place, he presented himself to the notice of Lieutenant-Colonel\r\n(afterwards Sir Archibald) Campbell, who, having first ascertained that\r\nhe was a Scotsman, inquired to whom he was known at New-York. Jackson\r\nreplied, to no one; but that a fellow-passenger from Jamaica would\r\nreadily testify to his being a gentleman. \"I require no testimony to\r\nyour being a gentleman,\" returned the kind-hearted colonel. \"Your\r\ncountenance and address satisfy me on that head. I will receive you into\r\nthe regiment with pleasure; but then I have to inform you, Mr. Jackson,\r\nthat there are seventeen on the list before you, who are of course\r\nentitled to prior promotion.\" The next day, at the instance of Colonel\r\nCampbell, the regimental surgeon, Dr. Stuart, appointed Jackson acting\r\nhospital or surgeon's mate--a rank now happily abolished in the British\r\narmy; for those who filled it, whatever might be their competency or\r\nskill, were accounted and treated no better than drudges. Although\r\ndischarging the duties that now devolve on the assistant-surgeon, they\r\nwere not, like him, commissioned, but only warrant-officers, and\r\ntherefore had no title to half-pay.\r\n\r\nDr. Stuart, who appears to have been a man superior to vulgar prejudice,\r\nand to have appreciated at once the extent of Jackson's acquirements and\r\nthe vigor of his intellect, relinquished to him, almost without control,\r\nthe charge of the regimental hospital. Here it was that this able young\r\nofficer began to put in practice that amended system of army medical\r\ntreatment which since his time, but in conformity with his teachings,\r\nhas been so successfully carried out as to reduce the mortality amongst\r\nour soldiery from what it formerly was--about fifteen per cent--to what\r\nit is now, about two and a half per cent.\r\n\r\nIn the army hospitals, at the period Jackson commenced a career that was\r\nto eventuate so gloriously, there was no regulated system of diet, no\r\nclassification of the sick. What are now well known as \"medical\r\ncomforts,\" were things unheard of; the sick soldier, like the healthy\r\nsoldier, had his ration of salt-beef or pork, and his allowance of rum.\r\nThe hospital furnished him with no bedding; he must bring his own\r\nblanket. Any place would do for a hospital. That in which Jackson began\r\nhis labors had originally been a commissary's store; but happily its\r\nroof was water-tight--an unusual occurrence--and its site being in close\r\nproximity to a wood, our active surgeon's mate managed, by the aid of a\r\ncommon fatigue party, to surround the walls with wicker-work platforms,\r\nwhich served the patients as tolerably comfortable couches. A further\r\nand still more important change he effected related to the article of\r\ndiet. He suggested, and the suggestion was adopted--honor to the\r\ncourageous humanity which did not shrink from so righteous an\r\ninnovation!--that instead of his salt ration and spirits, which he could\r\nnot consume, the sick soldier should be supplied with fresh meat,\r\nbroth, &c.; and that, as the quantity required for the invalid would be\r\nnecessarily small, the quarter-master should allow the saving on the\r\ncommuted ration to be expended in the common market on other comforts,\r\nsuch as sago, &c., suitable for the patient. Thus proper hospital diet\r\nwas furnished, without entailing any additional expense on the\r\nstate.[18]\r\n\r\nIndefatigable in the discharge of his interesting duties, Mr. Jackson\r\nspeedily obtained the confidence of his military superiors, who remarked\r\nwith admiration not only his intelligent zeal in performing his hospital\r\nfunctions, but his calmness, quickness of perception, and generous\r\nself-devotion when in the field of battle. On one occasion, although\r\nsuffering at the time from severe indisposition, he remained, under a\r\nheavy fire, succoring the wounded, in spite of the remonstrances of the\r\nofficers present. On another, having observed the British commander,\r\nColonel (afterwards General) Tarleton, in danger of falling into the\r\nhands of the enemy, who had routed the royalist troops, he galloped up\r\nto the colonel--whom a musket-ball had just dismounted-pressed him to\r\nmount his own horse and escape, whilst he himself, with a white\r\nhandkerchief displayed, quietly proceeded in the direction of the\r\nadvancing foe, and surrendered himself at once. The American commander,\r\nwho did not know what to make of such conduct, asked him who he was? He\r\nreplied: \"I am assistant surgeon in the 71st regiment. Many of the men\r\nare wounded, and in your hands. I come, therefore, to offer my services\r\nin attending them.\" He was accordingly sent to the rear as a prisoner;\r\nbut was well treated, and spent the first night of his captivity in\r\ndressing his soldiers' wounds, taking off his shirt, and tearing it up\r\ninto bandages for the purpose. He afterwards did the same good office\r\nfor the American sufferers; and when the wounded English could be\r\nexchanged, Washington sent him back, not only without exchange, but even\r\nwithout requiring his parole. At a subsequent period during the same\r\nunhappy war, when the British under Lord Cornwallis were in full\r\nretreat, the sick and wounded were placed in a building--which the\r\ncolonists, on their approach, began to riddle with shot. Several\r\nsurgeons, not caring to incur the risk of entering so exposed an\r\nedifice, agreed to cast lots who should go in and see to the invalids;\r\nbut Jackson, with characteristic nerve and simplicity, at once stepped\r\nforward: \"No, no,\" said he, \"I will go and attend to the men!\" He did\r\nso, and returned unhurt.\r\n\r\nAfter this we find him a prisoner in the hands of the Americans and\r\nFrench at Yorktown, Virginia. As on the former occasion, he was treated\r\nwith all imaginable kindness; and, being released on parole, returned to\r\nEurope early in 1782, and proceeded by way of Cork, Dublin, and Greenock\r\nto Edinburgh, where he abode for a short time. Thence he started for\r\nLondon: and, desirous of testing the best way of sustaining physical\r\nstrength during long marches, and urged perhaps also by economical\r\nconsiderations, he resolved to make the journey on foot. His West Indian\r\nand American experience had taught him that spare diet consisted best\r\nwith pedestrian efficiency, and it was accordingly his practice, during\r\nthis long walk, to abstain from animal food until the close of day, nor\r\noften then to partake of it. He would walk some fourteen miles before\r\nbreakfast--a meal of tea and bread; rest then for an hour or an hour and\r\na half; then pace on until bedtime--a salad, a tart, or sometimes tea\r\nand bread, forming his usual evening fare. He found that on this diet he\r\narose every morning at dawn with alacrity, and could prosecute without\r\ninconvenience his laborious undertaking. By way of experiment he twice\r\nor thrice varied his plan--dining on the road off beefsteaks, and having\r\na draught of porter in the course of the afternoon; but the result\r\njustified his anticipations. The stimulus of the beer soon passing off,\r\nlassitude succeeded the temporary strength it had lent him; and, worse\r\nthan all, his disposition to early rising sensibly diminished.\r\n\r\nHis stay in London, which he reached in this primitive fashion, was not\r\nlong. His kind friend Dr. Stuart, who had exchanged into the Royal\r\nHorse-Guards, gave him the shelter of his roof; but so poor was Mr.\r\nJackson, that, although ardently desirous of improving himself in his\r\nprofession, he was unable to attend any one of the medical schools with\r\nwhich London abounds.\r\n\r\nThe peace of 1783 having opened the continent to the curiosity of the\r\nBritish traveller, Jackson curtly announced to his friends, that \"he was\r\ngoing to take a walk.\" His poverty allowed him no other mode of\r\nlocomotion; so off he set on the grand tour, carrying with him a map of\r\nFrance, a bundle of clothes, and a scanty supply of money. Crossing the\r\nChannel, he reached Calais, a place which Horace Walpole, writing from\r\nRome, declared had astonished him more than any thing he had elsewhere\r\nseen, but in which our adventurer found nothing more astonishing than a\r\nsuperb Swiss regiment. He proceeded to Paris, and thence through\r\nSwitzerland, by Geneva and Berne, into Germany, at a town of which--Guenz\r\nin Suabia--he met with a comical enough adventure.\r\n\r\nOn entering the town he was challenged by a soldier, who, having learned\r\nhe had no passport, carried him before a magistrate, by whom he was\r\nforthwith condemned as a vagabond, and remitted to the custody of a\r\nrecruiting sergeant. This worthy, in turn, introduced him to the\r\ncommanding officer, who politely gave our traveller the choice of\r\nserving his Imperial and Apostolic Majesty, the Emperor of Germany,\r\neither in his cavalry or his infantry forces. But Jackson, strangely\r\ninsensible to the honor, flatly refused to serve his Majesty in these or\r\nany other ways, and desired to be at once set free, and suffered to\r\ncontinue his journey. The officer, doubtless, amazed at such\r\npresumption, desired the sergeant to convey him to the barracks, where\r\nhe was placed in a large room, in which were congregated some two\r\nhundred or so involuntary recruits like himself--harmless travellers,\r\nwho, being destitute of passports, the emperor forcibly enlisted into\r\nhis service. Jackson found his co-mates in misfortune very dirty, very\r\nragged, but perfectly civil and good-tempered. Having a little recovered\r\nhis serenity--for it is easy to see, though our hero is described as a\r\nman of placid demeanor and somewhat Quakerly appearance, he could be not\r\na little fiery at times--he sat down and wrote to the commanding\r\nofficer, entreating leave to sleep at an inn, and proffering the deposit\r\nof all his money as a pledge for his reappearance next morning. The\r\nreply was an order that he should surrender his writing materials. At\r\nseven o'clock, the appointed sleeping hour, the sergeant returned and\r\ngave the signal for bed by rapping with his cane on the floor, which was\r\nspeedily covered by a number of dirty bags of mouldy straw--the\r\nregulation mattresses, it would seem, for involuntary recruits.\r\nJackson--peppery again--refused to lie down, but was at last compelled\r\nto do so, and between two of the dirtiest fellows of the lot, each of\r\nwhom had a leg chained to an arm. The next morning, at his own request,\r\nhe was brought before the commandant of the town, who had only arrived\r\nlate the preceding evening, and whom he found seated in his bedroom,\r\n\"with all his officers standing round him receiving orders,\" says\r\nJackson, \"with more humility than orderly-sergeants.\" The commandant\r\nrepeated the offer of \"cavalry or infantry;\" adding that a war was about\r\nto commence with the Turks, and that good-behavior would insure\r\npromotion. However, finding Jackson obstinately persistent in his\r\nrefusal, he quietly observed, in conclusion, that the emperor, as a\r\nmatter of rule and of right, \"impressed\" into his army all such as\r\nentered his dominions without certificates of character. \"The order was\r\nso tyrannical,\" declares our _detenu_, \"that I could not contain myself.\r\n'Put me in chains, if you please,' I said, 'but I tell you, all Germany\r\nshall not make me carry a musket for the emperor.'\" This impetuous burst\r\nof indignation seems to have alarmed the pglegmatic commandant, who\r\naccordingly let our adventurer go, counselling him, however, to write to\r\nthe English ambassador at Vienna for a passport, lest he should get into\r\nfurther trouble.\r\n\r\nJackson passed through the Tyrol into Italy, every where indulging his\r\nlove of scenery and still greater love of adventure; studying with all\r\nthe acuteness of his countrymen the varied characters of the people he\r\nmet with, and in his correspondence with home friends, sketching them in\r\nlanguage striking for its force, its propriety, and originality. Some of\r\nhis remarks on men and manners are conceived in a truly Goldsmithian\r\nvein, whilst all testify at once to the goodness of his heart and the\r\nquickness of his perceptions. At Venice he says that he felt it to be\r\n\"such a feast of enjoyment as seldom falls to the lot of man, and never\r\nto the lot of any but a poor man, who has nothing conspicuous about him\r\nto attract the notice of the crowd,\" to possess such facilities as he\r\ndid for learning what the people of foreign countries really were.\r\n\r\nAt Albenga, in Piedmont, Jackson arrived one night, tired, hungry, and\r\ndrenched with rain. Intending to put up at the \"Albergo di San\r\nDominico,\" which he had been informed was the best inn, he went by\r\naccident to the convent of the same name, and entering, called loudly to\r\nbe shown to a private room. \"Instead of telling me I was wrong,\" he\r\nsays, \"the young brethren looked waggish, and began to laugh: when a man\r\nis cold and hungry, he can ill brook being the sport of others;\" so\r\naccordingly--peppery again--he shook his stick angrily at the young\r\nmonks. And at last one of the most courteous and demure of the number,\r\ncoming forward, said that although theirs was not exactly a public\r\nhouse, still the stranger was heartily welcome to walk in, rest, and\r\nrefresh himself. Discovering his mistake, Jackson of course lost no time\r\nin making his bow, his apologies, and acknowledgments.\r\n\r\nHe returned to England by way of France, having but six sous in his\r\npockets when he reached Bordeaux, where an English merchant, a total\r\nstranger, advanced him a few pounds. On the road, he was frequently\r\ntaken for an Irishman, and not seldom for an Irish priest; under which\r\nimpression, many civilities were paid him by the simple inhabitants of\r\nthe country he traversed. Ultimately he landed at Southampton, with just\r\nfour shillings in his possession: his once black coat having turned a\r\nrusty brown, his hat shovel-shaped by ill-usage, and his whole aspect so\r\ncomical, that the mob hooted him, under the belief that he was a\r\nMethodist preacher. Proceeding inland on foot, in the direction of\r\nSouthampton, he overtook a poor man walking along the road, whose looks\r\nof unutterable misery induced our traveller to stop and inquire what\r\nailed him. He told Jackson he had a son and daughter dying of a disorder\r\napparently contagious, and that no physician would attend them, as he\r\nwas too poor to pay the fees. Jackson at once offered his services,\r\nwhich were gratefully accepted. He saw his patients, and prescribed for\r\nthem, and his heart was touched by their simple expressions of\r\ngratitude. \"Their thankfulness,\" he says, \"for a thing that would\r\nperhaps do them no good, gave me more pleasure than a fee of, I believe,\r\ntwenty guineas, much in need of it as I was.\" The night had gathered in\r\nbefore he reached Winchester, where, at a respectable inn, he partook of\r\nsuch refreshment as his means afforded, and then desired to be shown to\r\nhis bedroom. The answer was, that the house contained no bedroom for\r\nsuch as he, and he was finally driven out with the coarsest abuse into\r\nthe streets. The hour was ten o'clock, the month December, and the\r\nseverity of the weather may be guessed from the fact, that the snow lay\r\ndeep on the ground. After wandering about for some time, he at last\r\nobtained shelter in a small house in the outskirts of the city. The next\r\nday he fared little better. \"On Sunday morning,\" he relates, \"I was\r\nsixty-four miles from London, and had only one shilling in my pocket. I\r\nwas hungry, but durst not eat; thirsty, and I durst not drink, for fear\r\nof being obliged to lie all night at the side of a hedge in a cold night\r\nin December. After dark, I travelled over to Bagshot; was denied\r\nadmittance into some of the public-houses, ill used in others.\" He\r\nsought in vain permission even to lie in a barn; but a laborer he\r\nfortunately fell in with conducted him to a house, where, at the\r\nsacrifice of his last shilling, he secured at length a bed. The next\r\nday--foot-sore, penniless and starving--he entered London. After\r\nremaining there a brief space--January, 1784--in spite of the inclement\r\nseason, he set off, again on foot, to Perth--a journey that occupied him\r\nthree weeks, as he was detained on the way by some friends whom he\r\nvisited. At Perth, where his old regiment then lay previous to its\r\ndisbandment, he amused himself by studying Gaelic, and the controversy\r\nrespecting Ossian and his poems. Quitting Perth, he travelled, still on\r\nfoot, through the Highlands, the inhabitants of which he was, in the\r\nfirst instance, disposed to class with savages; but when he had observed\r\nthe originality of conception, the breadth of humor, and the elevated\r\nsentiments which mark the Celt, his opinions underwent a total\r\nrevolution. He was especially delighted with a ragged old reiver or\r\ncattle-lifter whom he encountered, and who had given shelter to the\r\nYoung Chevalier in the braes of Glenmoriston after the battle of\r\nCulloden.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Edinburgh, Jackson married a lady of fortune, the\r\ndaughter of Dr. Stephenson, and niece of his old friend Colonel Francis\r\nShelley, of the 71st regiment; and was enabled by this accession to his\r\nmeans once again to visit Paris, where he not only resumed his medical\r\nstudies, but acquired the mastery of several languages, Arabic amongst\r\nthe rest. Having graduated M. D. at Leyden, he came back again to\r\nEngland, and commenced practice at Stockton-upon-Tees, in Durham.\r\nAlthough his reputation speedily became considerable, especially in\r\ncases of fever, he seems scarcely to have liked his new avocation. He\r\nfound solace, however, in his favorite study of language, which he\r\npursued with unremitting ardor--constantly reading through the Greek and\r\nLatin classics, and not only rendering himself familiar with the best\r\nworks of the modern continental authors, but also with the literature of\r\nthe Arabic, Persian, Hebrew, and Gaelic tongues. The _Bostan_ of Saadi\r\nis said to have been one of his most favorite poems.\r\n\r\nOn the war breaking out in 1793, Dr. Jackson--who, in 1791, had\r\npublished a valuable work on the fevers of Jamaica and continental\r\nAmerica--applied for employment as army-physician; but Mr. Hunter, the\r\ndirector-general of the medical department of the army, considering none\r\neligible for such employment who had not served as staff or regimental\r\nsurgeon, or apothecary to the forces, Jackson agreed to accept, in the\r\nfirst instance, the surgeoncy of the 3d Buffs, on the understanding,\r\nthat at a future time, he should be nominated physician as he desired.\r\nMr. Hunter, however, ever, died soon after this; and his promise was not\r\nfulfilled by the Board which succeeded him in the medical direction of\r\nthe army, and which appears to have pursued Dr. Jackson with uniform\r\nhostility.\r\n\r\nReturning to England with the troops, it was offered to him to\r\naccompany, in the capacity of chief medical officer, Sir Ralph\r\nAbercromby's expedition against some of the West India islands; and\r\nalthough no employment could possibly have been more agreeable to his\r\ntaste, he, much to Sir Ralph's chagrin, declined the flattering\r\nproposal, on the grounds, that lower terms had been offered to him than\r\nto another professional man. Nothing but a sense of professional\r\ndelicacy, it is plain, governed him in this transaction, for he\r\nimmediately afterwards embarked (April, 1796) as _second_ medical\r\nofficer in another expedition to San Domingo. During his abode in this\r\nisland, he was unwearied in enlarging his acquaintance with tropical\r\ndiseases--observing the rule he had followed in Holland of noting down\r\nby the patient's bedside the minutest particulars of every case he\r\nattended, the effects of the treatment pursued, and whatever else might\r\nshed light on the intricacies of pathological science. He also gave a\r\nlarger practical operation to the scheme he had years before devised of\r\namending the dietaries of military hospitals.\r\n\r\nAfter the evacuation of San Domingo in 1798, our physician paid a visit\r\nto the United States, where he was received with signal distinction, his\r\nreputation having preceded him. The latter part of the year found him\r\nagain at Stockton, publishing a work on contagious and endemic fevers,\r\n\"more especially the contagious fever of ships, jails, and hospitals,\r\nvulgarly called the yellow-fever of the West Indies;\" together with \"an\r\nexplanation of military discipline and economy, with a scheme for the\r\nmedical arrangements of armies.\" He undertook, about this time, by\r\ndesire of Count Woronzow, the Russian ambassador, the medical charge of\r\nseventeen hundred Russian soldiers, who were stationed in the Channel\r\nIslands in a sad state of disease and disorganization; and so admirably\r\ndid he acquit himself, and so perfect were the hospital provisions he\r\nmade, that (1800) the commander-in-chief nominated him physician and\r\nhead of the army-hospital depot at Chatham--as he says, \"without any\r\napplication or knowledge on his part.\" This appointment was the cause of\r\nhis subsequent misfortunes.\r\n\r\nAt Chatham, with the warm approbation of Major-General Hewett,\r\ncommanding the depot, he introduced that system of hospital reform form\r\nwhich had elsewhere operated so successfully. The changes he effected,\r\nas soon as they were made, became known to the Medical Board, and were\r\npublicly approved of by one of its members. However, shortly afterwards,\r\nan epidemic broke out in the depot (then removed to the Isle of Wight),\r\narising from the fact, that the barracks were overcrowded with young\r\nrecruits, but which the medical board ascribed to Jackson's innovations,\r\nand reported so to the Horse-Guards. The commander-in-chief directed an\r\ninquiry to take place before a medical board impannelled for the\r\npurpose, and the result of that inquiry may be guessed from a\r\ncommunication made by the War-Office to the commandant of the depot.\r\nThis states \"the unanimous opinion of the board to have exculpated Dr.\r\nJackson from all improper treatment of diseases in the sick,\" and the\r\ncommander-in-chief's gratification, \"than an opportunity has thus been\r\ngiven to that most zealous officer of proving his fitness for the\r\nimportant situation in which he is placed.\" The result of this wretched\r\nintrigue, however, was that Jackson, disgusted with the whole affair,\r\nrequested to be placed on half-pay, to which request the Duke of York,\r\nwith marked reluctance, at last (March 1803) acceded.\r\n\r\nIn his retirement at Stockton, Jackson put forth two valuable works, one\r\non the medical economy of armies, and another on that of the British\r\narmy in particular, and was much gratified by an offer to accompany, as\r\nmilitary secretary, General Simcoe, just appointed commander-in-chief in\r\nIndia. The general's sudden death, however, put an end to this plan; and\r\nJackson continued at Stockton, addressing frequent representations to\r\ngovernment on the defective medical arrangements in the military\r\nservice--representations the very receipt of which were not acknowledged\r\nby Mr. Pitt, to whom they were forwarded. The Peninsular war commencing,\r\nDr. Jackson was again named Inspector of Hospitals, but was not, thanks\r\nto the persevering enmity of the Medical Board, sent on foreign service,\r\nalthough he volunteered to sink his rank, and go in any capacity. The\r\nBoard even succeeded, by calumnious statements, that he had purchased\r\nhis diploma--statements he readily confuted--in preventing his\r\nappointment to the Spanish liberating army; although the British\r\ngovernment had formally requested him to accept such an appointment, and\r\nagreed to give credentials testifying to his capacity and\r\ntrustworthiness. This last appointment led him, in an unguarded\r\nmoment--peppery to the last--to inflict a slight personal chastisement\r\non the surgeon-general, for which he was imprisoned six months in the\r\nKing's Bench.\r\n\r\nBut the triumph of his enemies was not of long duration. In 1810 the\r\nBoard was dissolved, and the control of the medical department vested in\r\na director-general, with three principal inspectors subordinate to him.\r\nThen did Jackson return to active service, and from 1811 to 1815 was\r\nemployed in the West Indies; his reports from whence embracing every\r\ntopic relating to medical topography, to sanitary arrangements, and to\r\nthe observed phenomena of tropical disease, are, it is not too much to\r\nsay, invaluable. His hints as to the choice of sites for barracks, the\r\npropriety of giving to soldiers healthy employment and recreation, as a\r\nmeans of averting sickness, his suggestions as to the treatment of\r\nfevers and other endemic diseases, may be found in the various works he\r\nhas published, embodying the fruits of his West Indian experience.\r\n\r\nIn 1819, he was sent by government to Spain, where the yellow-fever had\r\nbroken out, and his report upon its characteristics has been universally\r\nadmitted to supply the fullest information on the subject that had\r\nhitherto been communicated to the public. He availed himself of his\r\npresence in that part of Europe to pay a visit to Constantinople and the\r\nLevant; and, retaining his energy to the last, when a British force was\r\nsent to Portugal in 1827, he desired permission to accompany it. The\r\nsands of his life, however, were then fast running out, and on the 6th\r\nof April in the same year he died, after a short illness, at Thursby,\r\nnear Carlisle, in the seventy-seventh year of his age. Thus closed a\r\nlong career of usefulness; for it is not too much to say, that few men\r\nof his time labored harder to benefit his fellow-creatures than did Dr.\r\nRobert Jackson.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSPANISH NAMES.--A Spanish journal gives the following singular names as\r\nthose of two _employes_ in the Finance department at Madrid:--Don\r\nEpifanio Mirurzururdundua y Zengotita, and Don Juan Nepomuceno de\r\nBurionagonatotorecagogeazcoecha. The journal would have done well to\r\nhave given some directions as to the pronunciation.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[18] The late Admiral Sir Edward Codrington, when in command, during the\r\nwar, of a frigate on the coast of Calabria, finding sickness appear\r\namongst his crew, purchased on his own responsibility some bullocks, for\r\nthe purpose of supplying them with fresh meat. Lord Collingwood having\r\nheard of this, and considering it a breach of discipline, sent for\r\nCodrington, and addressed him: \"Captain Codrington, pray have you any\r\nidea of the price of a bullock In this place?\" \"No, my lord,\" was the\r\nreply, \"I have not; but I know well the value of a British sailor's\r\nlife!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Dicken's Household Words.\r\n\r\nSTRINGS OF PROVERBS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a saying has passed into a national proverb, it is regarded as\r\nhaving received the \"hall-mark\" of the people, with respect to its\r\nprudence or practical wisdom. Proverbs deal only with realities,\r\ngenerally of the most homely and every-day kind, and are always supposed\r\nto comprise the most sage advice, or the most broad worldly truth,\r\nwithin the least possible compass.\r\n\r\nNow, while we admit that proverbs are for the most part true, and useful\r\nin their teaching, and that they very often inculcate excellent maxims,\r\nwe must at the same time enter our protest against the infallibility of\r\nmost of them. Numbers will be found, on the least examination (which is\r\nseldom given to them) to be one-sided truths; others, inculcate an\r\nutterly selfish conduct, under the guise of prudence or worldly wisdom;\r\nand some of them are absolutely false, or only of the narrowest\r\napplication. The majority of the proverbs, of all modern nations,\r\noriginate with the people, and with the humbler classes (we must except\r\nthe Chinese and Arabic, which are evidently the product of their sages),\r\nas witnessed by the homeliness of the allusions, and the frequent\r\nvulgarity, but, in all cases, the actual experience of life and its\r\nordinary occurences with regard to men and things. They are full of\r\ncorn, with a proportionate quantity of chaff and straw. Let us no\r\nlonger, therefore, take all these \"sayings\" for granted; let us rather\r\ntake them to task a little, for their revision and our own good.\r\n\r\nProverbs being the common property of all mankind, and often to be\r\ntraced to very remote geographical sources, we shall observe no national\r\nclassification; but string a few together now and then from Arabia and\r\nChina, from Spain, Italy, France, or England, just as they may occur.\r\nSo, now to our first string.\r\n\r\n_Honesty is the best policy._ This is true in the higher sense; but\r\ndoubtful in the sense usually intended. It is true as to the general\r\ngood, but not usually for the individual, except in the long run. (We\r\npass over the obvious truth, that it is better policy to earn a guinea,\r\nthan to steal one, because the proverb has a far wider range of meaning\r\nthan that.) To be a \"politic,\" clever fellow, a vast deal more humoring\r\nof prejudices, errors, and follies, is requisite, than at all assorts\r\nwith true honesty of character. If, however, we regard this proverb only\r\non its higher moral ground, then, of course, we must at once admit its\r\ntruth. The reader will probably be surprised, as we were, to find that\r\nit comes from the Chinese, and will be found in the translation of the\r\nnovel of \"_Iu-Kiao-Li_.\"\r\n\r\n_A leap from a hedge is better than a good man's prayer._ (Spanish.) The\r\nleap (of a robber) from his lurking-place, being preferable to asking\r\ncharity, and receiving a blessing, is one of those proverbs, the\r\nimpudent immorality of which is of a kind that makes it impossible to\r\nhelp laughing. Its frank atrocity amounts to the ludicrous. It is an old\r\nSpanish proverb, and occurs in \"Don Quixote\"--of course in the mouth of\r\nSancho.\r\n\r\n_A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush._ The extreme caution\r\nridiculed by this proverb is of a kind which one would hardly have\r\nexpected to be popular in a commercial country. If this were acted upon,\r\nthere would be an end of trade and commerce, and all capital would lie\r\ndead at the banker's--as a bird who was held safe. The truth is, our\r\nwhole practice is of a directly opposite kind. We regard a bird in the\r\nhand as worth only a bird; and we know there is no chance of making it\r\nworth two birds--not to speak of the hope of a dozen--without letting it\r\nout of the hand. Inasmuch, however, as the proverb also means to exhort\r\nus not to give up a good certainty for a tempting uncertainty, we do\r\nmost fully coincide in its prudence and good sense. It is identical with\r\nthe French \"_Mieux vaut un_ 'tiens' _que deux_ 'tu l'auras,'\"--one \"take\r\nthis\" is better than two \"thou shalt have it;\"--identical also with the\r\nItalian: _E meglio un uovo oggi, che una gallina domani_; an egg to-day\r\nis better than a hen to-morrow. It owes its origin to the Arabic--\"A\r\nthousand cranes in the air, are not worth one sparrow in the fist.\"\r\n\r\n_Enough is as good as a feast._ The best comment on this proverb that\r\noccurs to us was the reply made by Rooke, the composer (a man who had a\r\nfund of racy Irish wit in him), at a time when he was struggling with\r\nconsiderable worldly difficulties. \"How few are our real wants!\" said a\r\nconsoling friend; \"of what consequence is a splendid dinner? Enough is\r\nas good as a feast.\"--\"Yes,\" replied Rooke, \"and therefore a feast is as\r\ngood as enough--and I think I prefer the former.\"\r\n\r\n_Love me, love my dog._ At first sight this has a kindly appearance, as\r\nof one whose interest in a humble friend was as great as any he took in\r\nhimself; but, on looking closer into it, we fear it involves a curious\r\namount of selfish encroachment upon the kindness of others--a sort of\r\ndoubling of the individuality, with all its exactions. My dog (in\r\nwhatever shape) may be an odious beast; or, at best, one who either\r\nmakes himself, or, whose misfortune it is to be, very disagreeable to\r\ncertain people; but, never mind--what of that, if he is _my_ dog?\r\nSociety could not go on if this were persisted it.\r\n\r\n_Set a beggar on horseback, and he'll ride to the devil._ The direction\r\nin which he will ride depends entirely on the character of the\r\nbeggar--or poor man suddenly risen to power. Some sink over the other\r\nside of the horse, and drop into utter sloth and pampered sensualism;\r\nbut others do their best to ride well, and sometimes succeed. Masaniello\r\nand Rienzi did not ride long in the best way; but several patriots, who\r\nhave rapidly risen from obscurity to power, have set noble examples.\r\n\r\n_Throw him into a river, and he will rise with a fish in his mouth._\r\n(Arabic.) Some men are so fortunate that nothing can sink them. Where\r\nanother man would drown they find fish or pearls.\r\n\r\n_The monkey feared transmigration, lest he should become a gazelle._\r\n(Arabic.) The matchless conceit of some people, and utter ignorance of\r\nthemselves, either as to appearance or abilities, are finely expressed\r\nin the above.\r\n\r\n_The baker's wife went to bed hungry._ (Arabic.) How often is it seen,\r\nthat those who follow a profession or trade, are among the last to\r\ndisplay a special benefit from their calling! Our proverb, that\r\n\"Shoemakers' wives are the worst shod,\" seems to be derived from the\r\nsame source.\r\n\r\n_Chat echaude craint l'eau froide_; the scalded cat fears (even) cold\r\nwater. This is a better version of the English proverb of \"A burnt child\r\ndreads the fire.\" That the proverb is by no means of general\r\napplication, the experience of every one can avouch. It would be the\r\nsaving of many a child, of whatever age, who having been burnt should\r\nentertain a salutary dread of the fire ever after. But it is not so;\r\nwitness how many are burnt--_i.e._, ruined, wounded, shot, drowned, made\r\nridiculous, who had all been previously well warned by \"burning their\r\nfingers\" with losses, injuries by land and sea, and failures in attempts\r\ninvolving dangerous chances.\r\n\r\n_Crom a boo_; I will burn. This Irish proverb, or saying, may serve in\r\nmany respects as an adverse commentary on the preceding. There are\r\npeople who are never at rest when they are out of hot water--nor\r\ncontented when they are in. \"I will burn\" is the motto of the Duke of\r\nLeinster. It would do capitally for Mr. Smith O'Brien. Perhaps, however,\r\nit should not be read as a resolution to suffer, but as a threat to\r\ninflict a burning. Still, the vagueness of this threat--a dreadful\r\nannouncement with no definite object--would render it equally\r\napplicable.\r\n\r\n_Bis dat qui cito dat_; he gives double who gives promptly. The truth of\r\nthis is well illustrated by the converse it suggests; that he who long\r\ndelays and tantalizes before giving, earns less gratitude than scorn. It\r\nrequires more generosity and a finer mind to confer a favor in the best\r\nway, than to confer double the amount of the favor in itself.\r\n\r\n_What I gain afore I lose ahint._ (Scotch.) To be engrossed with a fixed\r\nobject, is to forget what is going on all around us. I am closely\r\nengaged with what is passing before my eyes, while I am deceived and\r\ninjured behind my back. This quaint old proverb has been ludicrously\r\nillustrated by a characteristic story. A Highlander, in a somewhat\r\nscanty kilt, was crossing a desolate moor one winter's night, and being\r\nvery cold, he hastened to a light he saw at no great distance. It turned\r\nout to be a decomposed cod's head, which sent forth phosphoric gleams.\r\nHe stooped down to try and warm his hands at it; but finding the bleak\r\nwinds whistling all round his legs, he made the sage observation above,\r\nwhich has passed into a proverb.\r\n\r\n_Entfloh'nes Wort, geworf'ner Stein, die kommen nimmermehr herein_; the\r\nhasty word, and hasty stone, can never be recalled. How truthful, how\r\nhome to the mark, does this proverb fly; how excellent is the warning\r\nand the self-command it inculcates!\r\n\r\n_To-day a fire, to-morrow ashes._ (Arabic.) Violent passions are the\r\nsoonest exhausted; to-day all-powerful, to-morrow nothing, or the\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\n_Reading the psalms to the dead._ (Arabic.) This is the original of our\r\n\"Preaching to the dead,\" to express the fruitlessness of exhortations,\r\napplications, or petitions, to certain insensible people.\r\n\r\n_Follow the owl, she will lead thee to ruin._ (Arabic.) A most\r\npicturesque proverb, giving its own scenery with it. But it strikes one\r\nas curious that this should come from the East which seems so familiar\r\nto our apprehensions. Not only are the habits of the owl the same, but\r\nthe owl is equally regarded as the symbol of a purblind fool. Yet, on\r\nthe other hand, the owl of classic times was a type of wisdom.\r\n\r\n_Two of a trade can never agree._ It is curious, and, in most instances,\r\nhighly gratifying, to see how many of these sayings of our ancestors are\r\nbecoming falsified by the great advances made, of late years, in social\r\nfeelings and arrangements. Trades' unions, co-operative societies--in\r\nfact, all our great companies prove how well two of a trade can agree;\r\nand so do all combinations of masters or of workmen. Yes, it will be\r\nsaid, but they \"agree,\" and co-operate for their mutual interests, and\r\nthey do not agree with those opposed to them. Of course not; the\r\nsensible thing, therefore, is obvious, to enlarge the sphere of good\r\nunderstanding and reciprocal fair dealing in matters of business, and\r\nthus to supersede the bad feeling and injury of greedy rivalries and\r\nselfish antagonisms.\r\n\r\n_There was a wife who always took what she had, and never wanted._\r\n(Scotch.) A good practical advice, showing the importance of using what\r\nyou possess, instead of hoarding it, or reserving it, even when most\r\nneeded, for some possible contingency, which may never occur. It seems\r\nto refer chiefly to articles of dress, clothing, domestic utensils, or\r\nother household matters.\r\n\r\n_Dat Deus immiti cornua curta bovi_; God curtails the power to do evil\r\nin those who desire to do it.\r\n\r\n_There is honor among thieves._ This is, no doubt, quite true, though\r\nyou must be a thief yourself to derive much benefit from it. They stand\r\nby their order. The suggestion is--since there is honor towards each\r\nother among the most unprincipled classes, surely Mr. Sweepstakes, and\r\nMr. Moses Battledore, who are both respectable members of society, and\r\nbelong to clubs, would not cheat me. But this does not logically follow;\r\nfor we by no means know how far the respectable individual makes his\r\nview of his own interest an excuse to himself for an occasional\r\nexception to the code of morality he professes. There's honor among\r\nthieves; and there are thieves (here and there) among\r\nhonorably-connected men, \"all honorable men.\" Life is a \"mingled yarn\"\r\nof good and evil; and society is a motley aggregate of all sorts of\r\nyarns.\r\n\r\n_A rose-bud fell to the lot of a monkey._ (Arabic.) The monkey\r\nappreciated the rose-bud quite as much as swine appreciate the pearls\r\nwhich are said to be cast before them.\r\n\r\n_Of what use to a fool is all the trouble he gives himself?_ (Chinese.)\r\nNone whatever; but his folly may cause a vast deal of trouble to people\r\nof sense. One false move of an utterly incompetent man in office, and\r\nthe force of the saying becomes very expansive.\r\n\r\n_There are no lies so wicked as those which have some foundation._\r\n(Chinese.) A saying which is but too true, and which ought to be\r\nuniversally understood in society, as some protection against slander.\r\n\r\n_Many preparations before the sour plum sweetens._ (Chinese.) Great\r\nresults do not hastily ripen; great and important changes must undergo a\r\ngradual process.\r\n\r\n_Spare the rod and spoil the child._ This seems to be derived from the\r\nold Spanish proverb, which we find in Don Quixote, \"He loves thee well\r\nwho makes thee weep.\" They are unkindly and dangerous maxims, which tend\r\nto inculcate severity, and to justify harsh treatment upon the plea of\r\nfuture advantage. We readily admit that nothing can well be worse than a\r\n\"spoilt child,\" nor can a more injurious system exist than that of\r\npampering or spoiling--except the direct opposite, that of frequently\r\ncausing tears.\r\n\r\n_A tea-spoonful of honey is worth a pound of gall._ An indiscriminate\r\nuse of the sweets of life is a stupidity and an injury; but the\r\njudicious use of them is of far more service in the production of good\r\nresults, than the bitter lessons which are often considered to be of\r\nmost advantage. It is better to soften the heart than to harden it. \"A\r\nsoft word turneth away wrath.\"\r\n\r\n_What the ant collects in a year, the priest eats up in a night._\r\n(Arabic.) The tithe-taxes, and other revenues of the state-clergy,\r\nderived from the industry of the working classes, are not very tenderly\r\ndealt with in this proverb.\r\n\r\n_The walls have ears._ (Arabic.) This is one of the many instances of\r\nour homeliest proverbs in every-day use, being derived from the East. No\r\ndoubt the saying, that \"Little pitchers have great ears\" (in allusion to\r\nthe sharpness of hearing in children), is also derived from the domestic\r\nutensils of foreign countries in ancient times. The British Museum\r\ncontains many such little pitchers, as well as the Foundling Hospital.\r\n\r\n_The ox that ploughs must not be muzzled._ (Arabic.) The laborer ought\r\nto be allowed freedom of speech, or at least free breathing. We have a\r\nnautical saying akin to this--\"A sailor never works well if he does not\r\ngrumble.\"\r\n\r\n_Three united men will ruin a town._ (Arabic.) The power of combination\r\nwas never more excellently expressed.\r\n\r\n_He begins the quarrel who gives the second blow._ (Spanish.) There are\r\nbut few who possess the requisite degree of wise and kindly forbearance\r\nand magnanimous self-command implied in this saying. To strike again, or\r\nrather (as the _blow_ is figurative) to retort an angry word, is natural\r\nto most men; to preserve a reproving silence, or administer a dignified\r\nrebuke, is in the power only of great characters, and not with them at\r\nall times. But it is quite possible, as we live in a very pugnacious\r\nworld, that such forbearance should not be thrown away upon every one,\r\nor the small majority of the magnanimous would soon be beaten out of\r\nexistence. The above proverb, we believe, is originally Spanish, and,\r\ncoming from a people so proverbially revengeful, seems very\r\nextraordinary, and only to be accounted for as the result of an abstract\r\nthought of some lofty-minded hidalgo, speculating on friendship. Don\r\nQuixote might have said it.\r\n\r\n_A stitch in time saves nine._ One of the most sensible and practical of\r\nall proverbs, as every body's experience can avouch. Yet, in defiance of\r\nall their own experience, how many people we often see who constantly\r\nneglect the stitch in time! They do not forget it, or overlook it; and\r\nwhen they do, if you point it out to them, they still neglect it.\r\n\r\n_Chi non sa niente, non dubita di niente_; he who knows nothing, doubts\r\nof nothing. The converse is equally true. He who knows much, is careful\r\nhow he doubts of any thing. This is peculiarly inculcated, at the\r\npresent time, by the extraordinary discoveries and success of science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Ladies' Companion.\r\n\r\nA CHAPTER ON WATCHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have no means of telling how long a period elapsed from that primal\r\ntime when the \"evening and the morning made the first day,\" ere man's\r\ningenuity devised a means of calculating the passing by of those\r\nprecious moments of which his duration is composed, in order to\r\neconomize them to the purposes of life. Shadows by day and stars at\r\nnight appear to have indexed the flight of time for the ancient Hebrews;\r\nthough it is very evident that long before the sun-dial of Ahaz was made\r\nmemorable by the Prophet Isaiah, the Chaldeans, accustomed to calculate\r\neclipses, and other astronomical phenomena, must have been in possession\r\nof some much more accurate instrument for its computation.\r\n\r\nDays, months, and years, are constantly referred to in the books of the\r\nOld Testament, but nothing is said of more minute divisions of time,\r\nsave that of the day into the natural ones of morning, noon, eventide,\r\nand night, until Judea became tributary to Rome, when three of the\r\nEvangelists, in describing the crucifixion, and the supernatural\r\ndarkness subsequent to that event, remark that it lasted from the sixth\r\n_hour_ to the ninth; and it is on record, that the Clepsydra, or\r\nwater-clock, (said by Vitrivius to have been invented by one Ctesibius\r\nof Alexandria, in the reign of Ptolemy Evergetes), was introduced at\r\nRome by P. Cornelius Scipio Nasica, in the 595th year of the city, and\r\nconsequently many years before the birth of Christ. This simple\r\ntime-keeper was so constructed, that the water issued, drop by drop,\r\nthrough a hole in the vessel, and fell into another, in which a light\r\nfloating body marked the height of the water as it rose, and by this\r\nmeans the time that had elapsed. These instruments, we are told, were\r\nset full of water in the courts of judicature, and by them the lawyers\r\npleaded; in order, as Phavorinus tells us, to prevent babbling, and\r\ncause those who spoke to be brief in their speeches. Hour, or\r\nsand-glasses, are also said to have originated at Alexandria, and to\r\nhave been introduced into domestic use amongst the Romans eight years\r\nafterwards, or 158 years before the Christian era.\r\n\r\nThe earliest attempt at measuring time in this country appears to have\r\nbeen on the part of Alfred the Great, by means of waxen tapers. The\r\nexact period when those direct ancestors of our subject, clocks, or, as\r\nthey were primitively called, horologes, came into use, is one of those\r\nthings over which time has cast so thick a veil, that not even the\r\nresearches of the encyclopaedists can penetrate it. By some, the\r\ninvention of clocks with wheels is ascribed to Pacificus, archdeacon of\r\nVerona, as early as the ninth century. And though we read that clocks\r\n(without water) were set up in churches toward the end of the twelfth,\r\nthe author of the \"Divina Commedia\" is the first writer on record, who\r\ndistinctly applies the term horologium to a clock that struck the hours;\r\nand he was born 1265, and died 1321.\r\n\r\nIn 1288, during the reign of the 1st Edward, the _English Justinian_, as\r\nhe has been called, it is said that a fine levied on a lord chief\r\njustice was applied to the purpose of furnishing the famous clock-house\r\nnear Westminster Hall with an horologe, which it is farther stated was\r\nthe work of an English artist.\r\n\r\nMention is also made of the setting up of a clock in Canterbury\r\nCathedral about the same period, and in that of Wells in 1325. So that\r\nthose three Dutch horologiers, from Delft, who came over (as Rymer tells\r\nus) at the invitation of Edward III. in 1368, were not, as some\r\nimagined, the introducers of the art, though they very possibly helped\r\nus to improve it. Up to the time when Henry de Wic astonished the\r\nEmperor Charles V. with those seemingly living toys with which he was\r\nwont to surround himself after dinner, and watch the beating and\r\nrevolving of their curious machinery, those rude prototypes of our\r\nsubject, which are said to have resembled small table clocks rather than\r\nwatches, and yet were true specimens, we imagine, since they continued\r\ngoing in a horizontal position, which is the only mechanical distinction\r\nbetween a watch and clock--up to this period, we were about to say,\r\nclocks appear to have endured a very ascetic existence, living in tall\r\nhouses, built on purpose for them, or shut up in church towers and\r\nmonastic buildings--\r\n\r\n    \"Fell sickerer[19] was his crowning in his loge,\r\n    As is a clock, or any _abbey orloge_,\"\r\n\r\nwrote Chaucer in the fourteenth century. And it is not until nearly the\r\nend of the fifteenth that we find them domesticated in houses.\r\n\r\nFrom a description of some, which appear in an inventory of articles in\r\nthe king's palaces of Westminster and Hampton Court, copied by Strutt,\r\nthe pendules of the period must have been equally ornate with those in\r\nmodern drawing-rooms, and much more curious. Thus one, we are told, not\r\nonly showed the course of the planets, and the days of the year, but was\r\nrichly gilt, and enamelled, and ornamented with the king's (Henry the\r\nEighth's) coat of arms; it also possessed a chime.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of this monarch reminds us, that previous to the scattering of\r\nthe treasures of Strawberry Hill, there was preserved in the library\r\nthere a little clock, of silver gilt, the gift of Henry, on the morning\r\nof his marriage, to the ill-fated Anne Boleyn. It was elaborately chased\r\nand engraved, and adorned with fleurs-de-lys, and other heraldic\r\ndevices, and had on the top a lion supporting the arms of England. The\r\ngilded weights represented _true-lovers-knots_, inclosing the initials\r\nof Henry and Anne; and one bore the inscription, \"The most happye,\" the\r\nother the royal motto. Though more than three hundred years had passed\r\nsince the tragic ending of time with its original possessor, it was\r\nstill going when the ivory hammer of the famous Robins struck it down to\r\nanother new and more fortunate owner, About this period watches are said\r\nto have been in use; and in the Holbein chamber of the collection just\r\nmentioned, a bust of the royal _wife-slayer_, carved in box-wood,\r\nrepresented him with a dial suspended on his breast. The earliest watch\r\nknown was one in Sir Ashton Lever's Museum, which bore date 1541; but\r\nfrom various imperfections in the workmanship, they were not very\r\ngenerally used till towards the end of Elizabeth's reign.\r\n\r\nShakspeare frequently mentions the clock, and in \"Twelfth Night\" he\r\nmakes Malvolio--\"While exclaim, in his babblings of fancied greatness\r\nI, perchance, _wind up my watch_, or play with some rich jewel,\" an\r\nexpression that would lead us to suppose that they were even then\r\nregarded rather as toys or ornaments than things of necessary use.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Parker, in 1575, left by will to the Bishop of Ely his staff\r\nof Indian cane, with a _watch_ in the top of it; a position that savors\r\nmore of whim than utility. Yet the excellence of some of these ancient\r\ntimekeepers is remarkable; for Derham, in his \"Artificial Clockmaker,\"\r\nmentions a watch of Henry VIII., which was in order in 1714, and of\r\nwhich Dr. Demanbray had often heard Sir Isaac Newton and Demoivre speak;\r\nand the old wooden-framed clock of Peterborough Cathedral, which,\r\ninstead of the usual key or winch, is wound up by long handles or\r\nspikes--a sufficient proof of its antiquity--still strikes, says\r\nDenison, upon a bell of considerable size.\r\n\r\nGuy Fawkes carried a watch in a more practical spirit than Malvolio or\r\nArchbishop Parker; Stowe tells us, one was found upon him which he and\r\nPercy had bought the day before, \"to try conclusions for the long and\r\nshort burning of the touch-wood with which he had prepared to give fire\r\nto the train of powder;\" a proof that even in the third year of the\r\nreign of James I. watches were not commonly worn, or the circumstance\r\nwould not have been mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn the next reign, however, we find the London \"Clock-Makers' Company,\"\r\nincorporated 1631--a sign of the increased use of these instruments, and\r\nthe growing importance of their manufacture; and as this charter\r\nprohibits the importation of clocks, watches, and alarms, it proves that\r\nwe had even then artists sufficiently skilful in the various\r\nmanipulations requisite in the construction of these articles, to render\r\nus independent of foreign workmanship.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular feature in the history of this branch of art, that it\r\nhas remained until very lately concentrated in the metropolis; besides\r\nwhich, Liverpool and Coventry are said to be the only places in England\r\nwhere a complete watch can be manufactured. At the latter place the\r\nbusiness has only been introduced since the commencement of the present\r\ncentury, but the number of persons employed are said to equal the number\r\nin London.\r\n\r\nBut before passing from this event in the history of our subject (the\r\nincorporation of a company for the protection of their manufacture in\r\nthe reign of Charles I.), we may as well describe a watch of the period,\r\nwhich a few years before the publication of the \"Encyclopaedia\r\nLondinensis\" (in 1811) had been in the possession of the proprietor. It\r\nwas dug up but a few years previously, near the site of the ancient\r\ncastle of Winchester, where it had probably lain from the time of\r\nCromwell, who, it is well known, destroyed that edifice. It was of an\r\noctagon form, and had no minute hand; a piece of catgut supplied the\r\nplace of a chain; it required winding up every twelve hours, had no\r\nbalance spring, and appeared never to have had one; and it shut like a\r\nhunting-watch without any glass.\r\n\r\nBut to compensate for this interior rudeness in its construction, the\r\nlid and bottom of the case, as well as the dial-plate, were of silver,\r\nvery neatly engraved, with pieces of Scripture history in the centre,\r\nand in the compartments the four Evangelists, and St. Peter, St. Paul,\r\nSt. James, and St. Jude: it had no date.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Charles II., who (like his namesake the emperor, in whose\r\ntime they first appeared) is said to have been very partial to these\r\ninstruments, was remarkable for the improvements made in them. Spring\r\npocket-watches were invented by Hooke, 1658; and repeaters were\r\nintroduced, one of the first of which Charles sent as a present to Louis\r\nXIV. of France. According to some authorities, _reproduced_ would be the\r\njuster phrase here, for it is stated in \"Memoirs of Literature,\" that\r\nsome of the most ancient watches were strikers, and that such having\r\nbeen stolen both from Charles V. and Louis XI. whilst they were in a\r\ncrowd, the thief was detected by their striking the hour!\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable repeating watch extant, is that in the\r\nAcademy of Sciences at St. Petersburg, and which, like the old Nuremberg\r\nwatches, is about the size of an egg: within is represented the holy\r\nsepulchre, with the sentinels, and the stone at the mouth; and while the\r\nspectator is admiring this curious piece of mechanism, the stone is\r\nsuddenly removed, the sentinels drop down, the angels appear, the women\r\nenter the tomb, and the same chant is heard which is performed in the\r\nGreek Church on Easter Eve.\r\n\r\nGermany, by the way, has always been famous for the manufacture of\r\nclocks and watches, these latter claiming Nuremberg for their\r\nbirthplace; and from this circumstance, and their oval shape,\r\nDopplemayer tells us they were originally known as Nuremberg _animated\r\neggs_.\r\n\r\nAt present this branch of horometry is chiefly to be found on the other\r\nside of the Alps, at or near Geneva, and at Chaux de Fond, in the\r\nprincipality of Neufchatel, where vast numbers of watches are\r\nmanufactured. But the wooden clocks, which tick on every cottage wall,\r\nand which are erroneously called Dutch, are in fact German, and are\r\nnearly all made in the Black Forest, the village of Freyburg being the\r\ncentre of the manufacture, whence it is said 180,000 wooden clocks on an\r\naverage are yearly exported.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss, or _Geneva_ watches, as they are commonly called, owing to\r\nthe poverty of the workmen, the employment of women, and the subdivision\r\nof labor, which is carried to even a greater extent than with us, sell\r\nat a much lower price than those made in England; but an English watch\r\nhas hitherto been a desideratum in every part of the world. Here, at\r\npresent, the term watch-maker is no longer applicable, every portion of\r\nthe instrument being the work of a different artisan, and the separate\r\nparts are often sent hundreds of miles, to meet in the metropolis, and\r\nmake a whole of excellent workmanship. There are innumerable places in\r\nwhich some branch or other of the manufacture is carried on; but the\r\nbest movements are made at Prescot, in Lancashire, while the town of\r\nWhitchurch, in Hampshire, is employed wholly in making hands. In London,\r\nClerkenwall Green has long been the resort of artificers employed in the\r\nvarious nice and delicate manipulations requisite in the construction of\r\nour subject: here, slide-makers, jewellers, motion-makers,\r\nwheel-cutters, cap-makers, dial-plate-makers, the painter, the\r\ncase-maker, the joint-finisher, the pendent-maker, the engraver, the\r\npiercer, the escapement-maker, the spring-maker, the chain-maker, the\r\nfinisher, the gilder, the fusee-cutter, the hand-maker, the glass-maker,\r\nand pendulum spring wire-drawer, are all located; for, owing to the\r\nminute division of labor, which tends greatly to facilitate its\r\nexecution after the movements (which have previously passed through\r\nthirteen workmen's hands in the provinces) are received in town, the\r\nwatch progresses through those of these other twenty-one artificers\r\nbefore it comes forth complete.\r\n\r\nOwing to this delicate and varied workmanship, materials originally not\r\nworth sixpence are frequently converted into watches worth a hundred\r\npounds and more, so costly may their appendages be made. But in all\r\nthese different branches of a business which maintains thousands of\r\nfamilies, the only part of it which falls to women in this country is\r\nthe polishing of the cases, which the casemakers' wives are sometimes\r\nemployed to do.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no object of man's ingenuity has been made the exponent of so\r\nmany grave morals as the _watch_. Poets and philosophers have managed\r\nthat its beatings should be only a little less gloomy to the imagination\r\nthan the associations of a passing bell; but Paley has thrown a glory\r\nround this gloom, and aggrandized it from a peevish reminder of passing\r\ntime into a fair argument of a Creator's presence, in the delicate and\r\nwonderful machinery of nature, which could no more come by chance than\r\ncould this little instrument have been formed without a contriver.\r\n\r\nWhat the author of the \"Old Church Clock\" has said of that branch of our\r\nsubject, may be equally applied to this--\"there is no dead thing so like\r\na living one.\" Day by day, year by year, its iron heart throbs on, some\r\nof them surviving, as we have seen, for centuries, though they are said\r\nto beat 17,160 times in an hour. Well would it be for us if the\r\ntime-keeper in our bosoms, beating momently the escape of our allotted\r\nterm, acted as lightly on the frame; but all its emotions help to wear\r\nthis out.\r\n\r\nIn the dawn of its appearance, in an age when every science that set men\r\nwondering was in some degree regarded as the work of magic, what a\r\nsensation must these \"animated eggs\" have occasioned, and how\r\nsuggestive! unless the fanciful belief of some of the early fathers of\r\nthe church, who averred that gems and precious metals were first made\r\nknown to mortals by fallen angels, who also inspired the desire to\r\nprofit by, and be adorned with them, had any thing to do with the\r\ntabooing of evil by holy signatures--how suggestive are the quaint\r\ngravings of saints and scriptural subjects on the cover of the watch dug\r\nup at Winchester, of the antique custom of inscribing trinkets with\r\nsacred symbols, and so converting them into amulets; a custom which the\r\nGreeks and Romans borrowed from the Egyptians, and which the early\r\nChristians perpetuated after them.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the watch, originally oval, take an octagon form; after\r\nwhich it subsided into its present shape, the only variation being in\r\nsize, and degrees of roundness.\r\n\r\nAt present watches are frequently made not thicker than a crown piece,\r\nand yet perform their functions with exactness; nay, there are some with\r\nperfect works, compressed into a smaller compass than a shilling! A\r\nfriend of the writer's saw one, not long since, set in a ring, the hands\r\nand figures being composed of brilliants, upon a dial of blue enamel;\r\nand at the recent exhibition one filled the place usually occupied by a\r\nseal at the end of a pencil-case, and another appeared as an appendage\r\nto a lady's bracelet. There was also a large silver watch, such as\r\nmariners are fond of wearing, immersed in a vase of water, and yet\r\nimpervious to any ill effects.\r\n\r\nOur subject is one which grows under our hands, and we might go on _ad\r\nlibitum_ describing their different idiosyncracies; for watches, like\r\nindividuals, have their several temperaments and ways of going. We have\r\nall met with _fast watches_ and slow ones, and some (a disposition they\r\nare apt to contract from their wearers) are very irregular--varieties of\r\ncharacter, which so puzzled their first owner, the Emperor Charles V.,\r\nwho amused himself on his retirement to the monastery of St. John, by\r\nendeavoring to keep in order these by-gone companions of his\r\ndinner-table, that they produced a reflection on the absurdity of his\r\nattempts to keep together the powers of Europe, when even these little\r\npieces of mechanism baffled him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmerican women have less courtesy than any others in the world. A\r\nthousand rules of deference are established by concessions of the other\r\nsex, which they enforce with ungracious arrogance, as if they were but\r\nrecognitions of \"inalienable rights.\" This is their offence to all\r\nwell-bred Europeans.--_Correspondent London Morning Post._\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[19] Sickerness--steady, secure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Sharpe's Magazine.\r\n\r\nFETE DAYS AT ST. PETERSBURG.\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH OF ALEXANDER DUMAS\r\n\r\nBY JANE STRICKLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew-Year's day and the Benediction of the Waters provide the inhabitants\r\nof St. Petersburg with two great national festivals, in which all\r\nclasses share in the pleasures and devotion of the sovereign. The first\r\nis an imperial fete, the second an imposing religious ceremony.\r\n\r\nOn New-Year's day, in virtue of an old and touching custom by which the\r\nEmperor and Empress of Russia are designated by their poorest subjects\r\nFather and Mother, these potentates at the commencement of the year\r\nreceive their children as their own invited guests. Their family being\r\ntoo vast to invite by name, they adopt the simple but efficacious plan\r\nof scattering about the streets of their capital twenty-five thousand\r\ncards of invitation, indicative that they will be at home to such a\r\nnumber of their children. These cards bear no address, but they give\r\nadmission to the bearers to the splendid saloons of the Winter Palace\r\nwithout the slightest distinction of rank or wealth.\r\n\r\nIt was thus that the Emperor Alexander, according to custom, kept the\r\nfirst day of the year 1825, the last he was ever destined to see. The\r\nrumor of the conspiracy that embittered the closing months of his life\r\nand reign, though it had reached his ears and troubled his repose, did\r\nnot appear to him any reason for depriving his subjects of their annual\r\nvisit to their sovereign. From these unknown guests the Russian Autocrat\r\nfelt assured he had nothing to fear. With them he was not only popular\r\nbut adored. He therefore directed the Master of the Police to order no\r\nalteration in the usual costume of the male part of the company, whom he\r\nwas to admit in masks according to custom on these occasions. In the\r\ndarkest annals of barbarism, despotic sovereigns dreaded and often found\r\nthe dagger of the assassin in the hands of some member of their own\r\nfamily. Civilization, however limited, changes the objects of suspicion\r\nto the aristocracy, who are always, under these unfortunate\r\nconstitutions, of the military profession. Now the want of the\r\ncounterpoise of the middle classes creates this secret but perpetual\r\nwarfare between the absolute monarch and the nobility--the nobility who\r\nin free countries are the natural bulwark of the throne. In Russia the\r\nAutocrat is never afraid of the multitude, with whom he holds a twofold\r\nclaim to their veneration, as supreme pontiff, or head of the Church,\r\nand Czar.\r\n\r\nThe cards of invitation, being transferable, are, as a matter of course,\r\npurchaseable; and among his masked guests who were privileged to shake\r\nhands with Alexander, some cowardly assassin might take that opportunity\r\nto murder the sovereign; yet he, with a firm but touching reliance on\r\nGod, ordered at seven o'clock on the New-Year's evening, the gates of\r\nthe Winter Palace to be thrown open as usual, to his motley company.\r\n\r\nNo extra precautions were taken by the police; the sentinels were on\r\nduty, according to custom, at the palace gates, but the Emperor was\r\nwithout any guards in the interior of the imperial residence, vast as\r\nthe Tuileries. In the absence of all precaution or even regulations for\r\nthe behavior of an undisciplined crowd, it was surprising what natural\r\npoliteness effected. Veneration for the presence of the sovereign was\r\nalone sufficient to produce good breeding; there was no pushing nor\r\nstriving, nor clamor, and the entrance was made with as little noise as\r\nif gratitude for the favor accorded to the guests had induced each to\r\ngive a precautionary admonition to his neighbor.\r\n\r\nWhile the thronging thousands were gaining admission to his palace, the\r\nEmperor Alexander was seated by the Empress in the Hall of St. George in\r\nthe midst of the imperial family, when the door was opened to the sound\r\nof music, for the saloons were filled with his visitors, and a grand\r\n_coup d'oeil_ of grandees, peasants, princesses, and grisettes was\r\ndiscerned. At this moment the Emperor advanced and gave his hand to the\r\nEnglish, French, Spanish, and Austrian ambassadors, the representatives\r\nof their several sovereigns. He then moved alone to the door, that his\r\nguests might behold in their sovereign and host the father of his\r\npeople. It was a moment anarchy was said to have dedicated to his\r\nassassination, and that parricidal and regicidal act could have been\r\neasily effected at such a juncture had it really been in contemplation.\r\nAlexander was no longer in appearance a melancholy and suffering\r\ninvalid, he looked happy and smiling; and if his smile was\r\ncounterfeited, he wore the mask ably and well. The instant the Autocrat\r\nappeared, the motley group made a forward movement, and then a\r\nprecipitate retreat. The danger vanished with them. The Emperor regarded\r\nthe retiring waves of this human sea with imperturbable serenity, a\r\nremarkable feature in his character, a moral re-action, which a\r\ncourageous mind can alone bestow, and which he had shown on several\r\ntrying occasions. One of these was at a ball given by M. Caulincourt,\r\nDuke of Vicenza, the French Ambassador; the other was at a fete at\r\nZakret, near Wilna.\r\n\r\nThe ball was at its height, when the ambassador was informed that the\r\nhouse was on fire; fearful that the news of the conflagration might\r\noccasion more ill consequences than the fire itself, he posted an\r\naide-de-camp at every door, and ordered his people to keep the\r\nmisfortune a profound secret, after which he communicated the accident\r\nin a low voice to the Emperor, and assured him that no one should be\r\npermitted to withdraw till he and the imperial family were in perfect\r\nsafety; he was going to see the fire extinguished, and he hoped the\r\nefforts made to get it under would be successful; adding, that even if a\r\nreport should circulate in the saloons as to this startling fact, no one\r\nwould credit it while they saw the Emperor and his family still there.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then, I will remain,\" coolly remarked the Emperor; and when\r\nCaulincourt returned some time after to announce the extinction of the\r\nfire, he found the Russian Autocrat dancing a polonaise.\r\n\r\nThe guests of the ambassador heard on the morrow that their festivities\r\nhad been kept over the mouth of a volcano.\r\n\r\nAt the fete held at Zakret not only the life but the empire of Alexander\r\nwas at stake. In the middle of the dance he was apprised that the\r\nadvanced guard of a guest he had forgotten to invite had passed the\r\nNiemen. This was the Emperor Napoleon, his old host at Erfurth, who\r\nmight momentarily be expected to enter the hall, followed by six hundred\r\nthousand dancers. Alexander gave his orders with great coolness,\r\nchatting while he issued them with his aide-de-camps. He walked about,\r\npraised the manner in which the saloons were lighted, which he declared\r\nwas only second to the beautiful moonlight, supped, and remained till\r\ndawn. His gay manner and the serenity of his countenance prevented the\r\nguests from even suspecting the nature of the communication he had\r\nreceived, and the entrance of the French into the city was the first\r\nintimation the inhabitants had received of their approach.\r\n\r\nHe was in imminent peril in this Polish city, from which his great\r\nself-command delivered him. His retreat at early morning was made before\r\nthe approach of an enemy he had hitherto found invincible. Very\r\ndifferent might have been the result of Napoleon's campaign in Russia,\r\nif the inhabitants of Wilna had known during the fete of Zakret of his\r\nvicinity.\r\n\r\nThese incidents naturally occurred to the guests of the Emperor\r\nAlexander, during this New-Year's day festival, when they beheld him\r\napproach alone to show himself to the multitude, amongst whom he had\r\nreason to believe many conspirators, or even assassins lurked. If such\r\nindeed were there, the calm serenity of his countenance disarmed them,\r\nand none dared raise an arm against the life he fearlessly trusted, if\r\nnot to their loyalty at least to their honor.\r\n\r\nIndeed the suffering and melancholy Emperor, the last time he received\r\nhis people, seemed to have shaken off his lassitude and depression, and\r\nappeared full of life and energy, traversing with rapidity the immense\r\nsaloons of the Winter Palace. He led off the sort of galoppe peculiar to\r\nthe Russian Court, which, however, terminated about nine o'clock.\r\n\r\nAt ten, the illuminations of the Hermitage being finished, those persons\r\nwho had cards for the spectacle went there. Twelve negroes, superbly\r\narrayed in rich oriental costumes, kept the doors of the theatre, to\r\nadmit or restrain the crowd, and examine the authenticity of the\r\nvouchers of the guests. Here the admission was not promiscuous, a\r\ncertain number alone being allowed to be present at the banquet.\r\n\r\nUpon entering the theatre, the spectators found themselves in a land of\r\nenchantment--a vast hall encircled with tubes of crystal, bent in every\r\npossible way, meeting at top in order to form the ceiling, united by\r\nsilver threads of imperceptible fineness, behind which hung 10,000\r\ncolored lamps, whose light, reflected and refracted by these transparent\r\ncolumns, illuminated the gardens, groves, flowers, cascades, and\r\nfountains, like an enchanted landscape, which seen across this veil of\r\nlight resembled the poetical phantasm of a dream. The splendid\r\nilluminations cost twelve thousand roubles, and lasted two months.\r\n\r\nAt eleven a flourish of musical instruments announced the arrival of the\r\nEmperor, who entered with the Empress and the imperial family, the\r\nambassadors, the ambassadresses, the officers of the household, and the\r\nladies in waiting, who all took their places at the middle supper-table;\r\ntwo other tables were filled by six hundred guests, mostly composed of\r\nthe first-class nobility. The Emperor alone remained standing, moving\r\nabout the tables, conversing by turns with his numerous guests.\r\n\r\nNothing could exceed the magnificent effect produced by the banquet, and\r\nthe appearance of the court; the sovereign and his officers and nobility\r\ncovered with gold and embroidery, the Empress and her ladies glittering\r\nwith diamonds and splendid velvets, tissues, and satins. No other fete\r\nin Europe could produce such a grand _coup d'oeil_ as the New-Year's\r\nfete at the Hermitage. At the conclusion of the banquet the Court\r\nreturned to the Saloon of St. George, where the music struck up a\r\npolonaise, which was led off by the Emperor. This dance was his farewell\r\nto his guests, for as soon as it was finished he withdrew. The departure\r\nof their sovereign gave pleasure to those loyal subjects who trembled\r\nfor his personal safety; but the courageous and ever paternal confidence\r\nreposed in his subjects by Alexander, turned away from him every\r\nmurderous weapon. No one could resolve to assassinate a kind father in\r\nthe midst of his children, for as such the Emperor had received his\r\nnumerous guests.\r\n\r\nThe second annual fete was of a religious character, \"The Benediction of\r\nthe Waters,\" to which the recent disastrous calamity of the most\r\nterrible inundation on record in Russia, the preceding year, had given\r\ndeeper solemnity. The preparations were made with an activity tempered\r\nby care, which denoted the national character to be essentially\r\nreligious. Upon the Neva a great pavilion was erected of a circular\r\nform, pierced with eight openings, decorated by four paintings, crowned\r\nwith a cross; to this pavilion access was given by a jetty forming the\r\nhermitage. The temporary edifice, on the morning of the ceremony, was to\r\nhave its pavement of ice cut through in order to permit the Patriarch to\r\nreach the water. The cold was already twenty degrees below zero, when at\r\nnine o'clock in the morning the whole population of St. Petersburg\r\nassembled themselves on the frozen waters of the Neva, then a solid mass\r\nof crystal. At half-past eleven the Empress and Grand-Duchesses took\r\ntheir places in the glass balcony of the Hermitage, and their appearance\r\nannounced to the crowd that the _Te Deum_ was concluded. The whole corps\r\nof the Imperial Guards, amounting to forty thousand men, marched to the\r\nsound of martial music and formed in line of battle on the river, from\r\nthe hotel of the French embassy to the fortress. The palace gates opened\r\nas soon as this military evolution was effected, and the banners, sacred\r\npictures, and the choristers of the chapel, appeared preceding the\r\nPatriarch and his clergy; then came the pages and the colors of the\r\ndifferent regiments of guards, borne by their proper officers; then the\r\nEmperor, supported by the Grand-Dukes Nicholas and Michael, followed by\r\nthe officers of his household, his aide-de-camps and generals. As soon\r\nas the Emperor reached the door of the pavilion, which was nearly filled\r\nwith priests and banners, the Patriarchs gave the signal, and the sweet\r\nsolemn chant of more than a hundred voices rose to heaven, unaccompanied\r\nby music indeed, yet forming a divine harmony hardly to be surpassed on\r\nearth. During the prayer, which lasted twenty minutes, the Emperor stood\r\nbareheaded, dressed in his uniform, without fur or any defence from the\r\npiercing cold, running more risk by this disregard to climate, than if\r\nhe had faced the fire of a hundred pieces of artillery in the front of\r\nbattle. The spectators, enveloped in fur mantles and caps, presented a\r\ncomplete contrast to the religious imprudence of their rash sovereign,\r\nwho had been bald from his early youth.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the second _Te Deum_ was concluded, the Patriarch took a\r\nsilver cross from the hand of the young chorister, and encircled by the\r\nkneeling crowd, plunged it through the opening made in the ice into the\r\nwaters below. He then filled a vase up with the consecrated element,\r\nwhich he presented to the Emperor. After this ceremonial of blessing the\r\nwaters, came the benediction of the standards, which were reverently\r\ninclined towards the Patriarch for that purpose. A sky-rocket was\r\nimmediately let off from the pavilion, and its silvery smoke was\r\nanswered by a terrible explosion, for the whole artillery of the\r\nfortress gave from their metallic throats a loud _Te Deum_, and these\r\nsalvos were heard three times during the benediction of the standards;\r\nat the third, the Emperor commenced his return to the palace.\r\n\r\nHe was more melancholy than usual, for during this religious ceremony he\r\nfelt no need of courage or presence of mind; he was secured by the\r\nnatural veneration of a superstitious people. He knew it, and,\r\ntherefore, wore no mask in the semblance of a joyless smile.\r\n\r\nOn the same day, this imposing ceremonial is used at Constantinople,\r\nonly the winter is a mere name and the water has no ice. The Patriarch\r\nstands on the deck of a vessel, and drops his silver cross into the calm\r\nblue waves of the Bosphorus, which a skilful diver restores to him\r\nbefore it reaches the bottom. To these religious ceremonies succeed\r\nsports and pastimes of all kinds. Booths and barracks are erected on the\r\nfrozen Neva from quay to quay, Russian mountains, down which sledges\r\nslide with inconceivable velocity, and the Carnival commences with as\r\nmuch zest as in cities enjoying a southern temperature. Plays are\r\nperformed on the ice, and curious pantomimes, in which a marmot performs\r\nthe part of a baby very cleverly, while the man who shows him off under\r\nthe character of the good father of the family, finds resemblances in\r\nthis black-nosed imp to all his supposed human relatives, to the\r\ninfinite delight of the spectators.\r\n\r\nSleighing on the ice is, as in Canada, a favorite diversion with the\r\nRussians, whose sledges are lined with fur and ornamented with silver\r\nbells and ribbons of every color. Sometimes a wind loaded with vapor\r\nputs an end to these diversions by rendering the ice unsafe, in which\r\ncase they are interdicted by the police, and the sports and pastimes of\r\nthe people are transferred to _terra firma_; but the Carnival is\r\nconsidered to come to an abrupt conclusion if this misfortune occurs at\r\nits commencement, for the Neva is to the inhabitants of St. Petersburg\r\nwhat Vesuvius is to the Neapolitans, and the absence of the ice robs\r\ntheir Saturnalia of its greatest attraction. In countries where the\r\nGreek religion is the national standard of faith, Lent is preceded by\r\nthe same unbounded festivity as in those which are Roman Catholic; but\r\nthe Court does not display in these days so much barbarous magnificence\r\nas in those earlier times when civilization was unknown. The Carnival\r\nwas, however, held during the last century by Anna Ivanovna, in a style\r\nsurpassing that of her ancestors. This pleasure-loving princess, the\r\ndaughter of the elder brother of Peter the Great, covered her usurpation\r\nof a throne she had snatched not only from the decendants of her mighty\r\nuncle, but also from her own elder sister and niece, by conducing to the\r\npopular amusements of her people, who in their turn forgot her defective\r\ntitle to the throne. This popular female sovereign founded the largest\r\nbell in the world, and gave the most magnificent Carnival ever held in\r\nRussia. Thus she maintained her sway by the aid of pleasure and\r\ndevotion, a twofold cord her subjects never broke. In 1740 Anna\r\nIvanovna resolved to surpass every preceding Carnival by her unique\r\nmanner of providing her people with amusement during this merry season.\r\nIt was customary for the sovereign of Russia to be attended by a dwarf,\r\nwho united the privileged character of a jester to the tiny proportions\r\nof a little child. This empress possessed two of these diminutive\r\npersonages, and she chose for her own amusement and that of her loving\r\nsubjects, that they should be married during this Carnival, and \"whether\r\nnature did this match contrive,\" or it was the consequence of her own\r\ndespotic will, cannot be known without a peep into the jealously guarded\r\narchives of Russia; but the nuptials of these sports of nature was the\r\nostensible cause of the fete. This the Autocrat gave on a new and\r\nsplendid scale. She directed her governors to send her two natives of\r\nthe hundred districts they ruled in her name, clothed in their national\r\ncostume, and with the animals they were accustomed to use on their\r\njourneys. The idea was certainly a brilliant one, and worthy of the\r\nsovereign lady of so many nations, tongues, and languages.\r\n\r\nAnna Ivanovna was punctually obeyed, and at the appointed time a motley\r\nprocession, including the purest types of the Caucasian race and the\r\nugliest of the Mongolian, astonished the eyes of the Empress, who had\r\nscarcely known the greater part of these distant tribes by name. There\r\nshe beheld the Kamtchadale with his sledge drawn by dogs, the Russian\r\nLaplander with his reindeer, the Kalmuck with his cows, the Tartar on\r\nhis horse, and the native of Bochara with his camel, the Ostiak on his\r\nclogs. Then for the first time, the beautiful Georgian and Circassian,\r\nwith their dark ringlets and unrivalled features, looked with\r\nastonishment upon the red hair of the Finlander. The gigantic Cossack of\r\nthe Ukraine eyed with contempt the pigmy Samoiede--and in fact, for the\r\nfirst time were brought into contact by the will of their sovereign\r\nlady, who classed each race under one of four banners, representing\r\nspring, summer, autumn, and winter; and these two hundred persons,\r\nduring eight days, paraded the streets of St. Petersburg, to the\r\ninfinite delight of the population, who had never seen the power of the\r\nthrone displayed in a manner so agreeable to their taste before.\r\n\r\nUpon the wedding day of her dwarfs, these important personages had been\r\nattended to the altar by this singular national procession, where they\r\nplighted their faith in the presence of the Empress and all her Court,\r\nafter which they heard Mass, and then, accompanied by their numerous\r\nescort, took possession of the palace prepared for them by the direction\r\nof their imperial mistress. This palace was not the least fanciful part\r\nof the fete. It was entirely composed of ice, and resembled crystal in\r\nits brilliancy and fine cutting and polish. This beautiful fabric was\r\nfifty-two feet in length and twenty in width; the roof, the floor, the\r\nfurniture, chandeliers, and even the nuptial bed, were formed of the\r\nsame cold, glittering, and transparent materials. The doors, the\r\ngalleries, and the fortifications,--even the six pieces of cannon that\r\nguarded this magical palace, were of ice; one of these, charged with a\r\nsingle ice-bullet, and fired by the aid of a pound of powder, perforated\r\nat seventy paces a plank of twelve inches thickness. This was done to\r\nsalute the bridal party, and welcome them home. The most curious piece\r\nof mechanism, and which pleased the Russians the most, was a colossal\r\nelephant, mounted by an armed Persian, and led by twelve slaves. This\r\ngigantic beast threw from his trunk a column of water by day, and at\r\nnight a stream of fire, uttering from time to time roars which were\r\nheard from one end of St. Petersburg to the other. These noble roars\r\nwere produced by twelve Russians concealed in the body and legs of the\r\nphantom elephant, whose costly housings hid the men whose noise so\r\ndelighted their countrymen. This Carnival of the fete-loving feany male\r\nusurper has never been surpassed by Russian sovereign, though, with the\r\nexception of the assembly of her distant subjects, its taste was\r\nbarbarous enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Household Words.\r\n\r\nRAINBOW MAKING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a great idea--too large to be arrived at but by degrees--that the\r\nfleece of sheep can clothe nations of men. The fleece of a sheep, when\r\npulled and spread out, looks much larger than while covering the mutton;\r\nbut still it is with a sort of despair that we think of the quantity\r\nrequired, and of the dressing and preparation necessary, for clothing\r\nfifteen million of men in one country, and double the number in another\r\n(to say nothing of the women), and of the number of countries, each\r\ncontaining its millions, which are incessantly demanding the fleeces of\r\nsheep to clothe their inhabitants. We remember the hill-sides of our own\r\nmountainous districts; and the wide grassy plains of Saxony; and the\r\nboundless table lands of Thibet, and the valleys of Cashmere, all\r\nspeckled over with flocks; we think of the Australian sheep-walks, where\r\nthere are flocks of such unmanageable size, that the whole sheep is\r\nboiled down for tallow; we think of Prince Esterhazy's reply to the\r\nquestion of an English nobleman, when shown vast flocks, and asked how\r\nhis sheep in Hungary would compare in number with these,--that his\r\nshepherds outnumbered the Englishman's sheep; we think of these things,\r\nand by degrees begin to understand how wool enough may be produced to\r\nfurnish the broadcloths and flannels of the world. But the most strong\r\nand agile imagination is confounded when the material of silk is\r\nconsidered in the same way. Compare a caterpillar with a sheep; compare\r\nthe cocoon of a silkworm (the achievement of its life) with the annual\r\nfleece of a sheep; and the supply of silk for the looms of Europe, Asia,\r\nand America, seems a mere miracle. The marvel is the greater, not the\r\nless, when one is in a silk-growing region, attending to the facts and\r\nappearances, than when trying to conceive of them at home. In Lombardy,\r\nwe travel from day to day, during the whole month of May, between rows\r\nof mulberry trees, where the peasants are busy providing food for the\r\nworms; a man in the tree stripping off the leaves, and two women below\r\nwith sacks, to carry home the foliage. We see what tons of leaves per\r\nmile must be thus gathered daily for weeks together; we go into houses\r\nin every village to inspect the worm; we mount to the flat roofs of the\r\ndwellings, and find in each countless multitudes of the worms; we pass\r\non, from country to country, till we mount to the hamlets, perched on\r\nthe rocky shelves of the Lebanon; and we find every where the insect\r\nsecreting its gum, or spinning it forth as silk; we remember that the\r\nsame process is going forward in the heart of our Indian Peninsula, and\r\nthroughout China; we look at the broad belt round the globe where the\r\nlittle worm is forming its cocoons; and still we find it impossible to\r\nimagine how enough silk is produced to supply the wants of the world,\r\nfrom the brocade of the Asiatic potentate to the wedding ribbon of the\r\nEnglish dairy-maid. Nowhere is the speculation more difficult than in a\r\ndye-house at Coventry.\r\n\r\nProbably there was as much wonder excited by the same thought, when King\r\nHenry VIII. wore the first pair of silk stockings brought to England\r\nfrom Spain; and when Francis I. looked after the mulberry trees in\r\nFrance, and fixed some silk weavers at Lyons; and when our Queen Mary\r\npassed a law forbidding servant-maids to wear ribbons on bonnets; and\r\nwhen monarch after monarch passed acts to teach how silk should be\r\nboiled, and whence it should be brought, and who should, and who should\r\nnot, wear it when wrought; but the perplexity and amazement of king,\r\nlords, and commons could hardly, at any time, have exceeded that of the\r\nhumblest visitor of to-day in any dye-house at Coventry. We know\r\nsomething of the fact of this astonishment; for we have been noting the\r\nwonders that are to be found on the premises of Messrs. Leavesley and\r\nHands at Coventry.\r\n\r\nOn entering, we see, ranged along the counters, half round the room,\r\nbundles of glossy silk, of the most brilliant colors. Blues,\r\nrose-colors, greens, lilacs, make a rainbow of the place. It is only two\r\ndays since this silk was brought in in a very different condition. The\r\nthrowster (to throw, means to twist or twine), after spinning the raw\r\nsilk, imported from Italy, Turkey, Bengal, and China, into thread fit\r\nfor the loom, sent it here in bundles, gummy, harsh, dingy; except,\r\nindeed, the Italian, which looks, till washed, like fragments of Jason's\r\nfleece. If bundles, and regiments of bundles, like these, come into one\r\ndye-house every few days, to be prepared for the weaving of ribbons\r\nalone, and for the ribbon-weaving of a single town, it is overwhelming\r\nto think of the amount of production required for the broad silk-weaving\r\nof England, of Europe, of the world. Of the silk dyed at Coventry, about\r\neighty per cent. is used for the ribbon-weaving of the city and\r\nneighborhood; and the quantity averages six tons and a half weekly. Of\r\nthe remaining twenty per cent., half is used for the manufacture of\r\nfringes; and the other half goes to Macclesfield, Congleton, and Derby.\r\n\r\nThe harsh gummy silk that comes in from the throwing mills is boiled,\r\nwrung out, and boiled again. If it wants bleaching, there is a sort of\r\nopen oven of a house; a vault in the yard where it is \"sulphured.\" The\r\nheat, and the sensation in the throat, inform us in a moment where we\r\nhave got to. When the hanks come forth from this process, every thread\r\nis separated from its neighbor, and the whole bundle is soft, dry, and\r\nglossy. Then follows the dyeing. To make the silk receive the colors, it\r\nis dipped in a mordant in some diluted acid, or solution of metal which\r\nenables the color to bite into the fibre. To make pinks of all shades,\r\nthe silk is dipped in diluted tartaric acid for the mordant, and then in\r\na decoction of safflower for the hue. To make plum-color or puce, indigo\r\nis the dye, with a cochineal. To make black, nitrate of iron first; then\r\na washing follows; and then a dipping in logwood dye, mixed with soap\r\nand water. For a white, pure enough for ribbons, the silk has to pass\r\nthrough the three primary colors, yellow, red, and blue. The dipping,\r\nwringing, splashing, stirring, boiling, drying, go on vigorously, from\r\nend to end of the large premises, as may be supposed, when the fact is\r\nmentioned that the daily consumption of water amounts to one hundred\r\nthousand gallons. A reservoir, in the middle of the yard, formerly\r\nsupplied the water; but it proved insufficient, or uncertain; and now it\r\nis about to be filled up, and an Artesian well is opened to the depth of\r\none hundred and ninety-five feet. The dyeing sheds are paved with\r\npebbles or bricks, crossed with gutters, and variegated with gay\r\npuddles. Stout brick-built coppers are stationed round the place. Above\r\neach copper are cocks, which let in hot and cold water from the pipes\r\nthat travel round the walls of the sheds. There are wooden troughs for\r\nthe dye; and to these troughs the water is conveyed by spouts. The silk\r\nhangs down into the dye from poles, smoothly turned and uniform, which\r\nare laid across the troughs by the dozen or more at once. These staves\r\nare procured from Derby. They cost from six shillings to twenty-four\r\nshillings per dozen, and constitute an independent subsidiary\r\nmanufacture. The silk hanks being suspended from those poles, two men,\r\nstanding on either side the trough, take up two poles, souse, and shake,\r\nand plunge the silk, and turn that which had been uppermost under the\r\nsurface of the liquor, and pass on to the next two. When done enough,\r\nthe silk is wrung out and pressed, and taken to the drying-house. The\r\nheat in that large chamber is about one hundred degrees. On entering it,\r\neverybody begins to cough. The place is lofty and large. The staves,\r\nwhich are laid across beams, to contain the suspended silk, make little\r\nmovable ceilings here and there. This chamber contains five or six\r\nhundred-weights of silk at once. Our minds glance once more towards the\r\nspinning insects on hearing this; and we ask again, how much of their\r\nproduce may be woven into fabrics in Coventry alone? We think we must\r\nhave made a mistake in setting down the weekly average at six tons and a\r\nhalf. But there was no mistake. It is really so.\r\n\r\nWhile speaking of weight, we heard something which reminded us of King\r\nCharles I.'s opinions about some practices which were going forward\r\nbefore our eyes. It appears, that the silk which comes to the dye-house\r\nis heavy with gum, to the amount of one-fourth of its weight. This gum\r\nmust be boiled out before the silk can be dyed. But the manufacturers of\r\ncheap goods require that the material shall not be so light as this\r\nprocess would leave it. It is dipped in well-sugared water, which adds\r\nabout eight per cent. to its weight. Many tons of sugar per year are\r\nused as (what the proprietor called) \"the silk-dyer's devil's dust.\" It\r\nwas this very practice which excited the wrath of our pious King\r\nCharles, in all his horror of double-dealing. A proclamation of his, of\r\nthe date of 1630, declares his fears of the consequences of \"a deceitful\r\nhandling\" of the material, by adding to its weight in dyeing, and\r\nordains that the whole shall be done as soft as possible; that no black\r\nshall be used but Spanish black, \"and that the gum shall be fair boiled\r\noff before dyeing.\" He found, in time, that he had meddled with a matter\r\nthat he did not understand, and had gone too far. Some of the fabrics of\r\nhis day required to be made of \"hard silk;\" and he took back his orders\r\nin 1638, having become, as he said, \"better-informed.\"\r\n\r\nFrom trough to trough we go, breathing steam, and stepping into puddles,\r\nor reeking rivulets rippling over the stones of the pavement; but we are\r\ntempted on, like children, by the charm of the brilliant colors that\r\nflash upon the sight whichever way we turn. What a lilac this is! Is it\r\npossible that such a hue can stand? It could not stand even the drying,\r\nbut for the alkali into which it is dipped. It is dyed in orchil first,\r\nand then made bluer, and somewhat more secure, by being soused in a\r\nwell-soaped alkaline mixture. That is a good red brown. It is from\r\nBrazil wood, with alum for its mordant. This is a brilliant blue;\r\nindigo, of course? Yes, sulphate of indigo, with tartaric acid. Here are\r\ntwo yellows: how is that? One is much better than the other; moreover,\r\nit makes a better green; moreover, it wears immeasurably better. But\r\nwhat is it? The inferior one is the old-fashioned turmeric, with\r\ntartaric acid. And the improved yellow? Oh! we perceive. It is a secret\r\nof the establishment, and we are not to ask questions about it. But\r\namong all these men employed here, are there none accessible to a bribe\r\nfrom a rival in the art? There is no saying; for the men cannot be\r\ntempted. They do not know, any more than ourselves, what this mysterious\r\nyellow is. But why does it not supersede the old-fashioned turmeric? It\r\nwill, no doubt; and it is gaining rapidly upon it; but it takes time to\r\nestablish improvements. The improvement in greens, however, is fast\r\nrecommending the new yellow. This deep amber is a fine color. We find it\r\nis called California, which has a modern sound in it. This Napoleon blue\r\n(not Louis Napoleon's) is a rich color. It gives a good deal of trouble.\r\nThere is actually a precipitation of metal, of tin, upon every fibre, to\r\nmake it receive the dye; and then it has to be washed; and then dipped\r\nagain, before it can take a darker shade; and afterwards washed again,\r\nover and over, till it is dark enough; when it is finally soused in\r\nwater which has fuller's earth in it, to make it soft enough for working\r\nand wear. What is doing with that dirty-white bundle? It is silk of a\r\nthoroughly bad color. Whether it is the fault of the worm, or of the\r\nworm's food, or what, there is no saying--that is the manufacturer's\r\naffair. He sent it here. It is now to be sulphured, and dipped in a very\r\nfaint shade of indigo, curdled over with soap. This will improve it, but\r\nnot make it equal to a purer white silk. Next, the wet hanks have to be\r\nsqueezed in the Archimedean press, and then hung up in that large, hot\r\ndrying-room.\r\n\r\nOne serious matter remains unintelligible to us. Plaid ribbons--that is,\r\nall sorts of checked ribbons--have been in fashion so long now, that we\r\nhave had time to speculate (which we have often done), on how they can\r\npossibly be made. About the colors of the warp (the long way of the\r\nribbon), we are clear enough. But how, in the weft, do the colors duly\r\nreturn, so as to make the stripes, and therefore the checks, recur at\r\nequal distances? We are now shown how this was done formerly, and how it\r\nis done now. Formerly, the hanks were tied very tightly, at equal\r\ndistances, and the alternate spaces closely wrapped round with paper, or\r\nwound round with packthread. This took up a great deal of time. We were\r\nshown a much better plan. A shallow box is made, so as to hold within it\r\nthe halves of several skeins of silk; these halves being curiously\r\ntwisted, so as to alternate with the other halves when the hanks are\r\nshaken back into their right position for winding. One half being\r\nwithin the box, and the other hanging out, the lid is bolted down so\r\ntight that the dye cannot creep into the box; and the out-hanging silk\r\nis dipped. So much can be done at once, that the saving of time is very\r\ngreat, and, judging by the prodigious array of plaid ribbons that we saw\r\nin the looms afterwards, the value of the invention is no trifle. The\r\nname of this novelty is the Clouding Box.\r\n\r\nWe see a bundle of cotton. What has cotton to do here? It is from\r\nNottingham--very fine and well twisted. It is a pretty pink, and it\r\ncosts one shilling and sixpence per pound to dye. But what is it for?\r\nAh! that is the question! It is to mix in with silk, to make a cheap\r\nribbon. Another pinch of devil's dust!\r\n\r\nThere is a calendering process employed in the final preparation of the\r\ndried silk, by which, we believe, its gloss is improved; but it was not\r\nin operation at the time of our visit. We saw, and watched with great\r\ncuriosity, a still later process--more pretty to witness than easy to\r\nachieve--the making up of the hanks. This is actually the most difficult\r\nthing the men have to learn in the whole business. Of course, therefore,\r\nit is no matter for description. The twist, the insertion of the arm,\r\nthe jerk, the drawing of the mysterious knot, may be looked at for hours\r\nand days, without the spectator having the least idea how the thing is\r\ndone. We went from workman to workman--from him who was making up the\r\nblue, to him who was making up the red--we saw one of the proprietors\r\nmake up several hanks at the speed of twenty in four minutes and a half,\r\nand we are no more likely to be able to do it, than if we had never\r\nentered a dye-house. Peeping Tom might spy for very long before he would\r\nbe much the wiser; when done, the effect is beautiful. The snaky coils\r\nof the polished silk throw off the light like fragments of mirrors.\r\n\r\nAnother mysterious process is the marking of the silk which belongs to\r\neach manufacturer. The hanks and bundles are tied with cotton string;\r\nand this string is knotted with knots at this end, at that end, in the\r\nmiddle, in ties at the sides, with knots numbering from one to fifteen,\r\ntwenty, or whatever number may be necessary; and the manufacturer's\r\nparticular system of knots is posted in the books with his name, the\r\nquantity of silk sent in, the dye required, and all other particulars.\r\n\r\nWe were amused to find that there is a particular twist and a particular\r\ndye for the fringe of brown parasols. It is desired that there should be\r\na claret tint on this fringe, when seen against the light; and here,\r\naccordingly, we find the claret tint. The silk is somewhat dull, from\r\nbeing hard twisted; it is to be made more lustrous by stretching, and we\r\naccompany it to the stretching machine. There it is suspended on a\r\nbarrel and movable pin; by a man's weight applied to a wheel, the pin is\r\ndrawn down, the hank stretches, and comes out two or more inches longer\r\nthan it went in, and looking perceptibly brighter. A hank of bad silk\r\nsnaps under this strain; a twist that will stand it is improved by it.\r\n\r\nLooking into a little apartment, as we return through the yard, we find\r\na man engaged in work which the daintiest lady might long to take out of\r\nhis hands. He is making pattern-cards and books. He arranges the shades\r\nof all sorts of charming colors, named after a hundred pretty flowers,\r\nfruits, and other natural productions,--his lemons, lavenders, corn\r\nflowers, jonquils, cherries, fawns, pearls, and so forth; takes a pinch\r\nof each floss, knots it in the middle, spreads it at the ends, pastes\r\ndown these ends, and, when he has a row complete, covers the pasted part\r\nwith slips of paper, so numbered as that each number stands opposite its\r\nown shade of color. A pattern-book is as good as a rainbow for the\r\npocket. This looks like a woman's work; but there are no women here. The\r\nmen will not allow it. Women cannot be kept out of the ribbon-weaving;\r\nbut in the dye-house they must not set foot, though the work, or the\r\nchief part of it, is far from laborious, and requires a good eye and\r\ntact, more than qualities less feminine. We found many apprentices in\r\nthe works, receiving nearly half the amount of wages of their qualified\r\nelders. The men earn from ten shillings to thirty shillings a week,\r\naccording to their qualifications. Nearly half of the whole number earn\r\nabout fifteen shillings a week at the present time.\r\n\r\nAnd, now, we are impatient to follow these pretty silk bundles to the\r\nfactory, and see the weaving. It is strange to see, on our way to so\r\nthoroughly modern an establishment, such tokens of antiquity, or\r\nreminders of antiquity, as we have to pass. We pass under St. Michael's\r\nChurch, and look up, amazed, to the beauty and loftiness of its tower\r\nand spire; the spire tapering off at a height of three hundred and\r\ntwenty feet. The crumbling nature of the stone gives a richness and\r\nbeauty to the edifice, which we would hardly part with for such clear\r\noutlines as those of the restored Trinity Church, close at hand. And\r\nthen, at an angle of the market-place, there is Tom, peeping past the\r\ncorner,--looking out of his window, through his spectacles, with a\r\nstealthy air, which, however ridiculous, makes one thrill, as with a\r\nwhiff of the breeze which stirred the Lady Godiva's hair, on that\r\nmemorable day, so long ago. It is strange, after this, to see the\r\nfactory chimney, straight, tall, and handsome, in its way, with its\r\ninlaying of colored bricks, towering before us, to about the height of a\r\nhundred and thirty feet. No place has proved itself more unwilling than\r\nCoventry to admit such innovations. No place has made a more desperate\r\nresistance to the introduction of steam power. No place has more\r\nperseveringly struggled for protection, with groans, menaces, and\r\nsupplications. Up to a late period, the Coventry weavers believed\r\nthemselves safe from the inroads of steam power. A Macclesfield\r\nmanufacturer said, only twenty years ago, before a Committee of the\r\nHouse of Commons, that he despaired of ever applying power-looms to\r\nsilk. This was because so much time was employed in handling and\r\ntrimming the silk, that the steam power must be largely wasted. So\r\nthought the weavers, in the days when the silk was given out in hanks or\r\nbobbins, and woven at home, or, when the work was done by handloom\r\nweavers in the factory--called the loom-shop. The day was at hand,\r\nhowever, when that should be done of which the Macclesfield gentleman\r\ndespaired. A small factory was set up in Coventry by way of experiment,\r\nin the use of steam power, in 1831. It was burned down during a quarrel\r\nabout wages,--nobody knows how or by whom. The weavers declared it was\r\nnot their doing; but their enmity to steam power was strong enough to\r\nrestrain the employers from the use of it. It was not till every body\r\nsaw that Coventry was losing its manufacture,--parting with it to places\r\nwhich made ribbons by steam,--that the manufacturers felt themselves\r\nable to do what must be done, if they were to save their trade. The\r\nstate of things now is very significant. About seventy houses in\r\nCoventry make ribbons and trimmings, (fringes and the like.) Of these,\r\nfour make fringes and trimmings, and no ribbons; and six or eight make\r\nboth. Say that fifty-eight houses make ribbons alone. It is believed\r\nthat three-fourths of the ribbons are made by no more than twenty houses\r\nout of these fifty-eight. There are now thirty steam powerloom factories\r\nin Coventry, producing about seven thousand pieces of ribbons in the\r\nweek, and employing about three thousand persons. It seems not to be\r\nascertained how large a proportion of the population are employed in the\r\nribbon manufacture: but the increase is great since the year 1838, when\r\nthe number was about eight thousand, without reckoning the outlying\r\nplaces, which would add about three thousand to the number. The total\r\npopulation of the city was found, last March, to amount to nearly\r\nthirty-seven thousand. So, if we reckon the numbers employed in\r\nconnection with the throwing-mills and dye-houses, we shall see what an\r\nascendency the ribbon manufacture has in Coventry.\r\n\r\nAt the factory we are entering, the preparatory processes are going\r\nforward at the top and the bottom of the building. In the yard is the\r\nboiler fire, which sets the engine to work; and, from the same yard, we\r\nenter workshops, where the machinery is made and repaired. The ponderous\r\nwork of the men at the forge and anvils contrasts curiously with the\r\ndelicacy of the fabric which is to be produced by the agency of these\r\nmasses of iron and steel. Passing up a step-ladder, we find ourselves in\r\na long room, where turners are at work, making the wooden apparatus\r\nrequired, piercing the \"compass boards,\" for the threads to pass\r\nthrough, and displaying to us many ingenious forms of polished wood.\r\nWhile the apparatus is thus preparing below, the material of the\r\nmanufacture is getting arranged, four stories overhead. There, under a\r\nskylight, women and girls are winding the silk from the hanks, upon the\r\nspools, for the shuttles. Here we see, again, the clouded silk, which is\r\nto make plaid ribbons, and the bright hues which delighted our eyes at\r\nthe dyeing-house. This is easy work,--many of the women sitting at their\r\nreels; and the air is pure and cool. The great shaft from the engine,\r\npassing through the midst of the building, carries off the dust, and\r\naffords excellent ventilation. Besides this, the whole edifice is\r\ncrowned by an observatory, with windows all round; and no complete\r\nceilings shut off the air between this chamber and the rooms of two\r\nstories below. In clear weather, there is a fine view from this\r\npinnacle, extending from the house, gardens, and orchard of the Messrs.\r\nHamerton below, over the spires of Coventry, to a wide range of country\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\nDescending from the long room, where the winding is going on, we find\r\nourselves in an apartment which it does one good to be in. It is\r\nfurnished with long narrow tables, and benches put there for the sake of\r\nthe work-people, who may like to have their tea at the factory, in peace\r\nand quiet. They can have hot water, and make themselves comfortable\r\nhere. Against the door hangs a list of books, read, or to be read, by\r\nthe people: and a very good list it is. Prints, from Raffaelle's Bible,\r\nplainly framed, are on the walls. In the middle of the room, on, and\r\nbeside, a table, are four men and boys, preparing the \"strapping\" of a\r\nJacquard loom for work. The cords, so called, are woven at Shrewsbury.\r\nWe next enter a room where a young man is engaged in the magical work of\r\n\"reading in from the draught.\" The draught is the pattern of the\r\nintended ribbon, drawn and painted upon diced paper,--like the patterns\r\nfor carpets that we saw at Kendal, but a good deal larger, though the\r\narticle to be produced here is so much smaller. The young man sits, as\r\nat a loom. Before him hangs the mass of cords he is to tie into pattern,\r\nclose before his face, like the curtain of a cabinet piano. Upreared\r\nbefore his eyes is his pattern, supported by a slip of wood. He brings\r\nthe line he has to \"read in\" to the edge of this wood, and then, with\r\nnimble fingers, separates the cords, by threes, by sevens, by fives, by\r\ntwelves, according to the pattern, and threads through them the string\r\nwhich is to tie them apart. The skill and speed with which he feels out\r\nhis cords, while his eyes are fixed on his pattern, appear very\r\nremarkable; but when we come to consider, it is not so complicated a\r\nprocess as playing at sight on the piano. The reader has to deal thus\r\nwith one chapter, or series, or movement, of his pattern. A _da capo_\r\nensues: in other words, the Jacquard cards are tied together, to begin\r\nagain; and there is a revolution of the cards, and a repetition of the\r\npattern, till the piece of ribbon is finished. In the same apartment is\r\nthe press in which the Jacquard cards are prepared; just in the way\r\nwhich may be seen wherever silk or carpet weaving, with Jacquard looms,\r\ngoes forward.\r\n\r\nAll the preparations having been seen--the making of the machinery, the\r\nfilling of the spools, the drawing and \"reading in\" of the pattern, and\r\nthe tying of the cords or strapping, we have to see the great process of\r\nall, the actual weaving. We certainly had no idea how fine a spectacle\r\nit might be. Floor above floor is occupied with a long room in each,\r\nwhere the looms are set as close as they can work, on either hand,\r\nleaving only a narrow passage between. It may seem an odd thing to say;\r\nbut there is a kind of architectural grandeur in these long lofty rooms,\r\nwhere the transverse cords of the looms and their shafts and beams are\r\nso uniform, as to produce the impression that symmetry, on a large\r\nscale, always gives. Looking down upon the details, there is plenty of\r\nbeauty. The light glances upon the glossy colored silks, depending, like\r\na veil, from the backs of the looms, where women and girls are busy\r\npiercing the imperfect threads with nimble fingers. There seems to be\r\nplenty for one person to do; for there are thirteen broad ribbons, or a\r\ngreater number of narrow ones, woven at once, in a single loom; yet it\r\nmay sometimes be seen that one person can attend the fronts, and another\r\nthe backs of two looms. In the front we see the thirteen ribbons getting\r\nmade. Usually, they are of the same pattern, in different colors. The\r\nshuttles, with their gay little spools, fly to and fro, and the pattern\r\ngrows, as of its own will. Below is a barrel, on which the woven ribbon\r\nis wound. Slowly revolving, it winds off the fabric as it is finished,\r\nleaving the shuttles above room to ply their work.\r\n\r\nThe variety of ribbons is very great, though in this factory we saw no\r\ngauzes, nor, at the time of our visit, any of the extremely rich ribbons\r\nwhich made such a show at the Exhibition. Some had an elegant and\r\ncomplicated pattern, and were woven with two shuttles (called the\r\ndouble-batten weaving) which came forward alternately, as the details of\r\nthe rich flower or leaf required the one or the other. There were satin\r\nribbons, in weaving which only one thread in eight is taken up,--the\r\ngloss being given by the silk loop which covers the other seven. On\r\nentering, we saw some narrow scarlet satin ribbons, woven for the Queen.\r\nWondering what Her Majesty could want with ribbon of such a color and\r\nquality, we were set at ease by finding that it was not for ladies, but\r\nhorses. It was to dress the heads of the royal horses. There were\r\nbride-like, white-figured ribbons, and narrow flimsy black ones, fit for\r\nthe wear of the poor widow who strives to get together some mourning for\r\nSundays. There were checked ribbons, of all colors and all sizes in the\r\ncheck. There were stripes of all varieties of width and hue. There were\r\ndiced ribbons, and speckled, and frosted. There were edges which may\r\nintroduce a beautiful harmony of coloring; as primrose with a lilac\r\nedge, green with a purple edge, rose color and brown, puce and amber,\r\nand so on. The loops of pearl or shell edges are given by the silk being\r\npassed round horse-hairs, which are drawn out when the thing is done.\r\nThere are belts,--double ribbons,--which have other material than silk\r\nin them; and there are a good many which are plain at one edge, and\r\nornamented at the other. These are for trimming dresses. One reason why\r\nthere are so few gauzes, is that the French beat us there. They grow the\r\nkind of silk that is best for that fabric, and labor is cheap with them;\r\nso that any work in which labor bears a large proportion to the\r\nmaterial, is peculiarly suitable for them.\r\n\r\nWe have spent so much time among the looms, that it is growing dusk in\r\ntheir shadows, though still light enough in the counting house for us to\r\nlook over the pattern-book, and admire a great many patterns, most, till\r\nwe see more. Young women are weighing ribbons in large scales; and a man\r\nis measuring off some pieces, by reeling. He cuts off remnants, which he\r\ncasts into a basket, where they look so pretty that, lest we should be\r\nconscious of any shop-lifting propensities, we turn away. There is a\r\nglare now through the window which separates us from the noisy weaving\r\nroom. The gas is lighted, and we step in again, just to see the effect.\r\nIt is really very fine. The flare of the separate jets is lost behind\r\nthe screens of silken threads, which veil the backs of the looms, while\r\nthe yellow light touches the beams, and gushes up to the high ceiling in\r\na thousand caprices. Surely the ribbon manufacture is one of the\r\nprettiest that we have to show.\r\n\r\nIf the Coventry people were asked whether their chief manufacture was in\r\na flourishing state, the most opposite answers would probably be given\r\nby different parties equally concerned. Some exult, and some complain,\r\nat this present time. As far as we can make out, the state of things is\r\nthis. From the low price of provisions, multitudes have something more\r\nto spare from their weekly wages than formerly, for the purchase of\r\nfinery: and the demand for cheap ribbons has increased wonderfully. As\r\nalways happens when any manufacture is prosperous, the operatives engage\r\ntheir whole families in it. We may see the father weaving; his wife, on\r\nthe verge of her confinement, winding in another room, or, perhaps,\r\nstanding behind a loom, piecing the whole day long. The little girls\r\nfill the spools; the boys are weaving somewhere else. The consequences\r\nof this devotion of whole households to one business, are as bad here as\r\namong the Nottingham lace-makers, or the Leicester hosiers. Not only is\r\nthere the misery before them of the whole family being adrift at once,\r\nwhen bad times come, but they are doing their utmost to bring on those\r\nbad times. Great as is the demand, the production has, thus far, much\r\nexceeded it. The soundest capitalists may be heard complaining that\r\ntheirs is a losing trade. Less substantial capitalists have been obliged\r\nto get rid of some of their stock at any price they could obtain: and\r\nthose ribbons, sold at a loss, intercept the sales of the fair-dealing\r\nmanufacturer. This cannot go on. Prosperous as the working-classes of\r\nCoventry have been, for a considerable time, a season of adversity must\r\nbe within ken, if the capitalists find the trade a bad one for them. We\r\nfind the case strongly stated, and supported by facts, in a tract, on\r\nthe Census of Coventry, which has lately been published there. It might\r\nsave a repetition of the misery which the Coventry people brought upon\r\nthemselves formerly--by their tenacity about protective duties, and\r\ntheir opposition to steam power--if they would, before it is too late,\r\nponder the facts of their case, and strive, every man in his way, to\r\nyield respect to the natural demand for the great commodity of his city;\r\nand to take care that the men of Coventry shall be fit for something\r\nelse than weaving ribbons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Examiner.\r\n\r\nBARTHOLD NIEBUHR, THE HISTORIAN.[20]\r\n\r\n\r\nNiebuhr was born pre-eminently gifted, was trained by intellectual and\r\ntender parents, and his whole career is one story of the progress made\r\nby a mind which united extraordinary powers with untiring industry. But\r\nNiebuhr was not only born to achieve greatness. He achieved love and\r\nfriendship in every relation of his life, he was a high-minded and in\r\nthe purest sense of the word an earnest man. In intellect he was a giant\r\namong us; but in him the intellect was not a statue raised above the\r\nmoral life, on which it trod as on a pedestal, a block of mere\r\nstone-mason's work; his heart had not been used up in the making of his\r\nbrains, or his soul cleared out a sacrifice to make room for a new stock\r\nof understanding. We may yield our minds up to admire Niebuhr\r\nunreservedly, and it is pleasant therefore to get a _Life_ of him in\r\nEnglish, so full as this is of the actual man, as he poured out portions\r\nthereof to his bosom friends, and wherein the large lumps of true\r\nNiebuhr gold are contained in a biographic deposit which itself is a\r\nlong way removed from dross. The quiet, unaffected way in which this\r\nwork has been done by the English writer of the book before us, her\r\nelegant simplicity of style, her thorough mastery of the subject, enable\r\nus to pass from Life to Letters, and from Letters back to Life, without\r\nany sense but of a perfect harmony between both. The two volumes are of\r\na kind that can be read through from the beginning to the end with\r\nunremitting pleasure. We strongly suspect that Niebuhr, at the age of\r\ntwelve, would have bewildered with his knowledge some few of our\r\nuniversity professors. Here is part of a sketch, representing him when\r\nhe was not very far removed from long clothes:\r\n\r\n     How keenly alive he was to poetical impressions appears from\r\n     a letter of Boje's written in 1783: \"This reminds me of\r\n     little Niebuhr. His docility, his industry, and his devoted\r\n     love for me procure me many a pleasant hour. A short time\r\n     back I was reading 'Macbeth' aloud to his parents without\r\n     taking any notice of him, till I saw what an impression it\r\n     made upon him. Then I tried to render it all intelligible to\r\n     him, and even explained to him how the witches were only\r\n     poetical beings. When I was gone, he sat down (he is not yet\r\n     seven years old), and wrote it all out on seven sheets of\r\n     paper without omitting one important point, and certainly\r\n     without any expectation of receiving praise for it; for,\r\n     when his father asked to see what he had written, and showed\r\n     it to me, he cried for fear he had not done it well. Since\r\n     then he writes down every thing of importance that he hears\r\n     from his father or me. We seldom praise him, but just\r\n     quietly tell him where he has made any mistake, and he\r\n     avoids the fault for the future.\r\n\r\n     \"The child's character early exhibited a rare union of the\r\n     faculty of poetical insight with that of accurate practical\r\n     observation. The amusements he contrived for himself afford\r\n     an illustration of this. During the periods of his\r\n     confinement to the house, before he was old enough to have\r\n     any paper given him, he covered with his writings and\r\n     drawings the margins of the leaves of several copies of\r\n     Forskaal's works, which were used in the house as waste\r\n     paper. Then he made copy books for himself, in which he\r\n     wrote essays, mostly on political subjects. He had an\r\n     imaginary empire called Low-England, of which he drew maps,\r\n     and he promulgated laws, waged wars, and made treaties of\r\n     peace there. His father was pleased that he should occupy\r\n     himself with amusements of this kind, and his sister took an\r\n     active part in them. There still exist among his papers many\r\n     of his childish productions; among others, translations and\r\n     interpretations of passages of the New Testament, poetical\r\n     paraphrases from the classics, sketches of little poems, a\r\n     translation of Poncet's Travels in Ethiopia, an historical\r\n     and geographical description of Africa, written in 1787 (the\r\n     two last were undertaken as presents to his father on his\r\n     birth-day), and many other things mostly written during\r\n     these years.\"\r\n\r\nHere is Niebuhr, at the age of thirty-four, Professor in Berlin, after\r\nhe had retired from official trusts which had imposed as many toils upon\r\nhim as would have made an enormously active life for one of the most\r\nancient tenants of our English pension list to look back upon:\r\n\r\n     \"Niebuhr's relinquishment of office, in 1810, forms an\r\n     important epoch in his life. He was now thirty-four years of\r\n     age, and since his twentieth year (with the exception of the\r\n     sixteen months passed in England and Scotland), had been\r\n     actively engaged in the public service. During this period\r\n     he had indeed never lost sight of his philological\r\n     researches, but he had only been able to devote to them his\r\n     few hours of leisure; now, it was to be seen whether he\r\n     could find satisfaction in the life of a student, after\r\n     years passed in the midst of the great world, and surrounded\r\n     by exciting circumstances. How far he had, however, turned\r\n     these leisure hours to account, may be judged by the\r\n     following memorandum, found, with many others of a similar\r\n     kind, among his papers, and written most probably in\r\n     Copenhagen about 1803:\r\n\r\n     \"Works which I have to complete: 1. Treatise on Roman\r\n     Domains. 2. Translation of El Wakidi 3. History of Macedon.\r\n     4. Account of the Roman Constitution at its various Epochs.\r\n     5. History of the Achaean Confederation, of the Wars of the\r\n     Confederates, and of the Civil Wars of Marius and Sylla, 6.\r\n     Constitutions of the Greek States. 7. Empire of the\r\n     Caliphs.\"\r\n\r\n\"No detailed outlines of these, or any of his other literary\r\nundertakings are to be found; but it must not be inferred that such\r\nmemoranda contain mere projects, towards whose execution no steps were\r\never taken. That Niebuhr proposed any such work to himself, was a\r\ncertain sign that he had read and thought deeply on the subject, but he\r\nwas able to trust so implicitly to his extraordinary memory, that he\r\nnever committed any portion of his essays to paper, till the whole was\r\ncomplete in his own mind. His memory was so wonderfully retentive, that\r\nhe scarcely ever forgot any thing which he had once heard or read, and\r\nthe facts he knew remained present to him at all times, even in their\r\nminutest details.\r\n\r\n\"His wife and his sister once playfully took up Gibbon, and asked him\r\nquestions from the table of contents about the most trivial things, by\r\nway of testing his memory. They carried on the examination till they\r\nwere tired, and gave up all hope of even detecting him in a momentary\r\nuncertainty, though he was at the same time engaged in writing on some\r\nother subject. He was once conversing with a party of Austrian officers\r\nabout Napoleon's Italian campaigns. Some dispute arose respecting the\r\nposition of different corps in the battle of Marengo. Niebuhr described\r\nexactly how they were placed, and the progress of the action. The\r\nofficers contradicted him; but on maps being brought he was found to be\r\nin the right, and to know more of the details of the conflict than the\r\nvery officers who had been present. One day, when he was talking with\r\nProfessor Welcker of Bonn, the conversation happened to turn on the\r\nweather, and Niebuhr quoted the results of barometrical observations in\r\nthe different years, as far back as 1770, with perfect accuracy. This\r\npower was not a merely mechanical faculty; it was intimately connected\r\nwith the power of instantaneously seizing on all the relations of any\r\nfact placed before him, and with his wonderful imagination; his\r\nimagination, however, was that of an historian, not of a poet--it was\r\nnot creative, but enabled him to form from the most various, and\r\napparently inadequate sources, distinct and truthful pictures of scenes,\r\nactions, and characters. Hence his keen delight in travels: hence, too,\r\nhis habit of pronouncing judgment on the men of other countries and of\r\npast times, with all the warmth of a fellow-countryman and a\r\ncontemporary.\r\n\r\n\"With his warm affections, and clear-sighted moral sense, it was\r\nimpossible for him to form such opinions on past or present history,\r\ncoolly standing aloof, as it were, and regarding the subject with calm\r\nsuperiority; he could not but condemn and despise all that was\r\npernicious and base; he could not but love and reverence, with his whole\r\nheart, whatever was noble and beautiful. Such opinions and feelings he\r\nexpressed with the utmost frankness, sometimes even with vehemence, when\r\nprudence would have counselled more guarded language.\"\r\n\r\nHere is Professor Niebuhr holding up a bright example to our friends who\r\nfear to look ridiculous in rifle clubs:\r\n\r\n     \"On the evacuation of Berlin by the French in February,\r\n     1813, Niebuhr shared in the national rejoicings, and not\r\n     less in the enthusiasm displayed in the preparations for the\r\n     complete re-conquest of freedom. When the Landwehr was\r\n     called out, he refused to evade serving in it, as he could\r\n     take no other part in the war. His wish was to act as\r\n     secretary to the general staff; but if this were not\r\n     possible, he meant to enter the service as a volunteer with\r\n     some of his friends. For this purpose he went through the\r\n     exercises, and when the time came for those of his age to be\r\n     summoned, sent in his name as a volunteer to the Landwehr.\r\n     He would have preferred entering a regular regiment, and\r\n     applied to the King for permission to do so; but this\r\n     request was refused by him, and he added that he would give\r\n     him other commissions more suited to his talents.\r\n\r\n     \"Niebuhr's friends in Holstein could hardly trust their eyes\r\n     when he wrote them word that he was drilling for the army,\r\n     and that his wife entered with equal enthusiasm into his\r\n     feelings. The greatness of the object had so inspired Madame\r\n     Niebuhr, who was usually anxious, even to a morbid extent,\r\n     at the slightest imaginable peril for the husband in whom\r\n     she might truly be said to live, that she was willing and\r\n     ready to bring even her most precious treasure as a\r\n     sacrifice to her country.\"\r\n\r\nHitherto we have quoted the biography, but on this point, and at a time\r\nwhen we are seeking to forearm ourselves against the chance of evil, it\r\nmay edify us to hear Niebuhr himself speak on the theme of ball\r\npractice. Niebuhr, it should be remembered, writes at a time when two\r\nvolumes of his great work, the \"History of Rome,\" had been appreciated\r\nby the public:\r\n\r\n     \"I come from an employment in which you will hardly be able\r\n     to fancy me engaged--namely, exercising. Even before the\r\n     departure of the French, I began to go through the exercise\r\n     in private, but a man can scarcely acquire it without\r\n     companions. Since the French left, a party of about twenty\r\n     of us have been exercising in a garden, and we have already\r\n     got over the most difficult part of the training. When my\r\n     lectures are concluded, which they will be at the beginning\r\n     of next week, I shall try to exercise with regular recruits\r\n     during the morning, and as often as possible practice\r\n     shooting at a mark..... By the end of a month I hope to be\r\n     as well drilled as any recruit who is considered to have\r\n     finished his training. The heavy musket gave me so much\r\n     trouble at first, that I almost despaired of being able to\r\n     handle it; but we are able to recover the powers again that\r\n     we have only lost for want of practice. I am happy to say\r\n     that my hands are growing horny; for as long as they had a\r\n     delicate bookworm's skin, the musket cut into them\r\n     terribly.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now let us give a view of Niebuhr as Professor in Bonn, together\r\nwith a few well-written notes upon his character:\r\n\r\n     \"We have seen that, at Berlin, Niebuhr delivered his\r\n     lectures _verbatim_ from written notes. At Bonn, on the\r\n     contrary, his only preparation consisted in meditating for a\r\n     short time on the subject of his lecture, and referring to\r\n     authorities for his data, when he found it necessary, and he\r\n     brought no written notes with him to the lecture-room. His\r\n     success in imparting his ideas varied greatly at different\r\n     times, as it depended almost entirely on his mental and\r\n     physical condition at the moment. He always felt a certain\r\n     difficulty in expressing himself. He grasped his subject as\r\n     a whole, and it was not easy to him to retrace the steps by\r\n     which he had arrived at his results. Hence his style was\r\n     harsh and often disjointed; and yet he possessed a species\r\n     of eloquence whose value is of a high order--that of making\r\n     the expression the exact reflection of the thought--that of\r\n     embodying each separate idea in an adequate, but not\r\n     redundant form. The discourse was no dry, impersonal\r\n     statement of facts and arguments, or even opinions; the\r\n     whole man, with his conceptions, feelings, moral sentiments,\r\n     nay passions too, was mirrored forth in it. Hence Niebuhr\r\n     not merely informed and stimulated the minds of his hearers,\r\n     but attracted their affections. That he did this in an\r\n     eminent degree, was not indeed owing to his lectures alone,\r\n     but also to his kind and generous conduct. All who deserved\r\n     it were sure of his sympathy and assistance, whether\r\n     oppressed by intellectual difficulties, or pecuniary cares.\r\n     During the first year, he delivered his lectures without\r\n     remuneration; afterwards, on its being represented to him\r\n     that this would be injurious to other professors who could\r\n     not afford to do the same, he consented to take fees, but\r\n     employed them in assisting poor scholars and founding\r\n     prizes. He often, however, still remitted the fee privately,\r\n     when he perceived that a young man could not well afford it,\r\n     and never took any from friends.\r\n\r\n     \"But those who were admitted to his domestic circle were the\r\n     class most deeply indebted to him. His interest in all\r\n     subjects of scientific or moral importance was always\r\n     lively; and it was impossible to be in his company without\r\n     deriving some accession of knowledge and incentive to good.\r\n     From his associates he only required a warm and pure heart\r\n     and a sincere love of knowledge, with a freedom from\r\n     affectation or arrogance. Where he found these, he willingly\r\n     adapted himself to the wants and capacities of his\r\n     companions; would receive objections mildly, and take pains\r\n     to answer them, even when urged by mere youths, and weigh\r\n     carefully every new idea presented to him. He was fond of\r\n     society, and while his irritability not seldom gave rise to\r\n     slight misunderstandings and even temporary estrangements in\r\n     the circle of his acquaintance, there were some friends with\r\n     whom he always remained on terms of unbroken intimacy, among\r\n     whom may be named Professors Brandis, Arndt, Nitzsch, Bleek,\r\n     Naeke, Welcker, and Hollweg. He enjoyed wit in others, and in\r\n     his lighter moods racy and pointed sayings escaped him not\r\n     unfrequently.\r\n\r\n     \"His intercourse was not confined to literary circles. In\r\n     all the civil affairs of the town and neighborhood he took\r\n     an active interest from principle as well as inclination,\r\n     for he considered a man as no good citizen who refused to\r\n     take his share of the public business of the neighborhood in\r\n     which he lived; and the loss which left so great a blank in\r\n     the world of letters, was also deeply regretted by his\r\n     fellow-townsmen of Bonn. Niebuhr's mode of life at Bonn was\r\n     very regular, and his habits simple. He hated show and\r\n     unnecessary luxury in domestic life. He loved art in her\r\n     proper place, but could not bear to see her degraded into\r\n     the mere minister of outward ease. His life in his own\r\n     family showed the erroneousness of the assertion that a\r\n     thorough devotion to learning is inconsistent with the\r\n     claims of family affection. He liked to hear of all the\r\n     little household occurrences, and his sympathy was as ready\r\n     for the little sorrows of his children as for the\r\n     misfortunes of a nation. He was in the habit of rising at\r\n     seven in the morning, and retiring at eleven. At the simple\r\n     one o'clock dinner, he generally conversed cheerfully upon\r\n     the contents of the newspapers which he had just looked\r\n     through. The conversation was usually continued during the\r\n     walk which he took immediately afterwards. The building of a\r\n     house, or the planting of a garden, had always an attraction\r\n     for him, and he used to watch the measuring of a wall, or\r\n     the breaking open of an entrance, with the same species of\r\n     interest with which he observed the development of a\r\n     political organization. The family drank tea at eight\r\n     o'clock, when any of his acquaintance were always welcome.\r\n     But during the hours spent in his library, his whole being\r\n     was absorbed in his studies, and hence he got through an\r\n     immense amount of work in an incredibly short time.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, here is the death of the immortal historian:\r\n\r\n     \"The last political occurrence in which Niebuhr was strongly\r\n     interested, was the trial of the ministers of Charles the\r\n     Tenth; it was indirectly the cause of his death. He read the\r\n     reports in the French journals with eager attention; and as\r\n     these newspapers were much in request at that time, from the\r\n     universal interest felt in their contents, he did not in\r\n     general go to the public reading-rooms where he was\r\n     accustomed to see the papers daily, until the evening. On\r\n     Christmas Eve and the following day, he was in better health\r\n     and spirits than he had been for a long while, but on the\r\n     evening of the 25th of December he spent a considerable time\r\n     waiting and reading in the hot news-room, without taking off\r\n     his thick fur cloak, and then returned home through the\r\n     bitter frosty night air, heated in mind and body. Still full\r\n     of the impression made on him by the papers, he went\r\n     straight to Classen's room, and exclaimed, 'That is true\r\n     eloquence! You must read Sauzet's speech; he alone declares\r\n     the true state of the case; that this is no question of law,\r\n     but an open battle between hostile powers! Sauzet must be no\r\n     common man! But,' he added immediately, 'I have taken a\r\n     severe chill, I must go to bed.' And from the couch which he\r\n     then sought, he never rose again, except for one hour, two\r\n     days afterwards, when he was forced to return to it quickly\r\n     with warning symptoms of his approaching end.\r\n\r\n     \"His illness lasted a week, and was pronounced, on the\r\n     fourth day, to be a decided attack of inflammation on the\r\n     lungs. His hopes sank at first, but rose with his increasing\r\n     danger and weakness; even on the morning of the last day he\r\n     said, 'I may still recover.' Two days before, his faithful\r\n     wife, who had exerted herself beyond her strength in nursing\r\n     him, fell ill and was obliged to leave him. He then turned\r\n     his face to the wall, and exclaimed with the most painful\r\n     presentiment, 'Hapless house! To lose father and mother at\r\n     once!' And to the children he said, 'Pray to God, children!\r\n     He alone can help us!' And his attendants saw that he\r\n     himself was seeking comfort and strength in silent prayer.\r\n     But when his hopes of life revived, his active and powerful\r\n     mind soon demanded its wonted occupation. The studies that\r\n     had been dearest to him through life, remained so in death;\r\n     his love to them was proved to be pure and genuine by its\r\n     unwavering perseverance to the last. While he was on his\r\n     sick bed, Classsen read aloud to him for hours the Greek\r\n     text of the Jewish History of Josephus, and he followed the\r\n     sense with such ease and attention, that he suggested\r\n     several emendations in the text at the moment; this may be\r\n     called an unimportant circumstance, but it always appeared\r\n     to us one of the most wonderful proofs of his mental powers.\r\n     The last learned work in which he was able to testify his\r\n     interest, was the description of Rome by Bunsen and his\r\n     friends, which had just been sent to him; the preface to the\r\n     first volume was read aloud to him, and called forth\r\n     expressions of pleasure and approbation. He also asked for\r\n     light reading to pass the time, but our attempts to satisfy\r\n     him were unsuccessful. A friend proposed the 'Briefe eines\r\n     Verstorbenen,' which was then making a great sensation; but\r\n     he declined it, faying he feared that its levity would jar\r\n     upon his feelings. One of Cooper's novels was recommended to\r\n     him, and excited his ridicule by its extraordinary verbiage;\r\n     he was much amused by trying an experiment he proposed,\r\n     which consisted in taking one period at hap-hazard on each\r\n     page; and by the discovery that this mode of reading did\r\n     little violence to the connection of the story. The\r\n     'Colnishe Zeitung' was read aloud to him up to the last day,\r\n     with extracts from the French and other journals. He asked\r\n     for them expressly, only twelve hours before his death, and\r\n     gave his opinion half in jest about the change of ministry\r\n     in Paris. But on the afternoon of the 1st of January, 1831,\r\n     he sank into a dreamy slumber; once on awakening, he said\r\n     that pleasant images floated before him in sleep; now and\r\n     then he spoke French in his dreams; probably he felt himself\r\n     in the presence of his departed friend De Serre. As the\r\n     night gathered, consciousness gradually faded away; he woke\r\n     up once more about midnight, when the last remedy was\r\n     administered; he recognized in it a medicine of doubtful\r\n     operation, never resorted to but in extreme cases, and said\r\n     in a faint voice, 'What essential substance is this? Am I so\r\n     far gone?' These were his last words; he sank back on his\r\n     pillow, and within an hour his noble heart had ceased to\r\n     beat.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Niebuhr's wife died nine days after him, on the 11th of the\r\n     same month, about the same hour of the night. She died, in\r\n     fact, of a broken heart, though her disease was, like his,\r\n     an inflammation of the chest. She could shed no tears,\r\n     though she longed for them, and prayed God to send them;\r\n     once her eyes grew moist, when his picture was brought to\r\n     her at her own request, but they dried again, and her heavy\r\n     heart was not relieved. She had her children often with her,\r\n     particularly her son, and gave them her parting counsels.\r\n     And so her loving and pure soul went home to God. Both rest\r\n     in one grave, over which the present King of Prussia has\r\n     erected a monument to the memory of his former instructor\r\n     and counsellor.

Chapman & Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Household Words.\r\n\r\nPICTURE ADVERTISING IN SOUTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe concentrated wisdom of nations used formerly to be sought for in\r\ntheir proverbs; we look for it now-a-days in their newspapers. Whether\r\nwe always find what we seek, in this respect, may be a question; but\r\nsomething is sure to turn up in them that will repay the search, though\r\nthe leading article, the records of parliament and of law, or even the\r\nletters of \"our own correspondent,\" may fail to disclose it. The\r\n\"intelligent\" reader will at once see that we point to the advertising\r\ncolumns, but we are not going to inflict an epitome of the first and\r\nsecond pages of the _Times_, or present an abstract of its Supplement,\r\ncharacteristic of our country as the result might prove. We purpose to\r\ngo somewhat further afield, and tread upon ground hitherto unbroken. A\r\nfile of South American newspapers has suggested to us that it might\r\nprove amusing, if not instructive, to describe the wants and wishes, the\r\nhabits of life, and something of the pervading tone of society, in\r\ncertain parts of that hemisphere, as shown in the advertisements of the\r\nperiodical journals. We have selected the city of Buenos Ayres for this\r\nillustration, and turn at once to our file.\r\n\r\nThe political feature is absent here, for where men have always arms in\r\ntheir hands to establish a new \"Constitution,\" or destroy an old one,\r\nthey look elsewhere than to a newspaper advertisement for the arena\r\nwherein to exhibit their valor or patriotism. Their \"London Tavern,\"\r\ntheir \"Town Hall,\" their \"Copenhagen Fields,\" or \"Bull-ring,\" are to be\r\nfound on their wide-spreading Pampas, or in the fastnesses of their\r\nSierras, with the _lasso_ at the saddle-bow, the sharp spur on the heel,\r\nthe _trabrigo_ (carbine) in the holster, and the lance or sabre in the\r\ngrasp. These politicians have no time for reading or writing\r\nadvertisements, nor would it answer any very useful purpose if they did.\r\nThe only attempt that is ever made to catch the patriotic eye, is where\r\na formal notice is issued by the authorities, touching taxes, or a\r\nmuster of militia for some peaceful end; on these occasions, a \"_Viva la\r\nFederation!_\" (Long live the Confederation!) appears at the head of the\r\nadvertisement announcing the fact; and when it has a quasi-military\r\ncharacter attached to it, the portrait of an infantry soldier under\r\narms, in white tights, Hessian boots, crossbelts, stiff stock, and\r\nponderous chako (none of them very pleasant things to think of in\r\nlatitude thirty-four degrees south, with the thermometer ninety-six in\r\nthe shade), is invariably added. But the confederation is not appealed\r\nto merely because the nature of the advertisement may seem to require\r\nit; we find the same heart-stirring refresher associated with ass's\r\nmilk, live turtle, runaway slaves--with everything, indeed, that has an\r\ninterest for the community, portable or edible, necessary to its\r\ncomfort, or serviceable to its desires.\r\n\r\nBut if liberty has very little claim on the advertising columns of a\r\nnewspaper in Buenos Ayres, there is a large set-off in favor of slavery.\r\nThe papers teem with notices concerning that portion of the people who\r\nhave the misfortune not to belong to themselves. And here it may be\r\ndesirable to advert to a feature which is essential to the success of an\r\nadvertisement in South America; it must be pictorial. Our own country\r\nnewspapers, and most of the continental ones,--those of our Parisian\r\nfriends in particular,--show us what can be done in this way; but they\r\ndo not elaborate their subject after the manner of the Buenos-Ayreans.\r\nWith them the advertisement must have a double chance; they who can read\r\nmay enjoy the advantages of a liberal education in plain type;--they who\r\nhave not been introduced to the schoolmaster may gather the meaning of\r\nthe \"noticia\" from the greater or less striking resemblance of the\r\nobject advertised to the woodcut which illustrates it. It is true, a\r\ndifficulty may sometimes arise in the latter case, owing to an\r\neconomical employment of the same block to represent a great variety of\r\nactions; the same slave is always in the attitude of a fugitive, whether\r\nhe be described as running away with all his might, or quietly standing\r\nstill to be sold; the same horse is always in a high trotting condition,\r\nwhether he be supposed to career across the plain, or hold up a foot to\r\nbe shod; the same bull has always his head bent down, with the same\r\nmischievous poke of the horns, whether he be advertised for slaughter or\r\nrecommended for sport.\r\n\r\nA cook who might make a pudding with quick-lime instead of flour, and\r\ninstead of a bath-brick send in a real one, would not accord with the\r\nnotions of an English housewife. Female slaves who are to be sold, are\r\nrepresented as like to Atalanta, as the males are to Hippomenes. They,\r\ntoo, attired in a long night-gown, which has very much the look of\r\nimpeding their flight, are always bolting with a bundle, which probably\r\ncontains the bonnet they never appear in, or the shoes they are not\r\nsupposed to wear. In like manner, if you wish to buy (_se desca\r\ncomprar_) a slave, of either sex, you do so with your eyes open; for the\r\ngreat probability that the new purchase will vanish on the first\r\nfavorable opportunity, is vividly get forth in the woodcut that speaks\r\nfor all. The prices are tolerably high,--a boy, as we have seen, fetches\r\nnine hundred dollars; a woman-servant (_una criada_), fifteen hundred;\r\nand a man in the prime of his age,--for manual labor,--eighteen hundred,\r\nor two thousand. What a fortune Louis Napoleon might make, if he could\r\nestablish a market-value for those whom he proscribes! M. Thiers would\r\nthen be worth four hundred pounds!\r\n\r\nThe next step is to religion,--or, at least, to its forms and\r\nceremonies. We see the vignette of an altar-table, covered with a fair\r\ncloth, whereon stand a crucifix, and a pair of long waxen tapers, in\r\nfull blaze, a holy-water pot, and a sprinkling-brush, are placed beside\r\nthe table, beneath which is spread a handsome carpet. So much for the\r\nemblem; now for the text:\r\n\r\n     \"Dona Agustina Lopez de Rosas, the citizens Don Prudencio\r\n     and Don Gervacio Ortiz de Rosas, and others, brothers, wife,\r\n     and sons of the deceased Don Leon Ortiz de Rosas (Q.E.P.D.),\r\n     invite those gentlemen who, by accident, have not received\r\n     notes of invitation, to accompany them to pray to God for\r\n     mercy on the soul of the aforesaid deceased, in the\r\n     Cathedral Church, at ten o'clock of the 20th of March\r\n     current, by which they will feel under infinite obligation.\"\r\n\r\nThe next is a more than half-obliterated impression of an image of the\r\nsun, partly obscured by clouds, with the obligato crucifix in the midst,\r\nheaded \"Ave Maria;\"--it is the third advertisement (_tercer aviso_), and\r\nis addressed by the Superiors (Mayordomos) of the most Holy Rosary to\r\nall faithful and devout sons of the most holy Mary.\r\n\r\nThe text of this address we need not give; the substance will be\r\nsufficient. It tells the history of the completion of the two naves and\r\nother parts of the church of the Patriarch San Domingo, which have been\r\npainted, whitewashed, and otherwise decorated, in the sight of all the\r\nfaithful (_a la vista de todos los fieles_), and--to make a long story\r\nshort--money is wanted to make it what the priests wish it, and'\r\ntherefore the superiors intend to stand daily in the chief porch to\r\nreceive subscriptions, the smallest sums being--as in England, and every\r\nwhere else--most gratefully received.\r\n\r\nThe mortuary advertisements are not absolutely a transition \"from\r\npraying to purse-taking;\" only a variety of the same general mode of\r\ndealing. We select two of these:--In the first, we behold a lady in the\r\nfull-dress evening costume of the Empire, with a very short waist, and\r\nvery little drapery above it, leaning pensively against a funereal\r\nmonument; an embroidered pocket-handkerchief being placed beneath one\r\nelbow, to protect it from the cold marble; in her left hand she carries\r\na substantial wooden cross, which is held so as to fall over the\r\nshoulder; a weeping willow on the opposite side to the mourning lady\r\nbalances the composition. Below the picture is the announcement that\r\n\"Funereal letters (_Esquelas de Funerales_) of every tasteful\r\ndescription, engraved as well as lithographic, and at a very moderate\r\nprice, are to be obtained at the printing-office of the Mercantile\r\nGazette, in the street of Cangallo, No. 75, where designs of all kinds\r\nmaybe seen.\" The second is more sombre in outward show, but less\r\napplicable to the general business of the advertiser. It is headed,\r\n\"Interesting to all whom it may concern.\" (_Interesante a quienes\r\nconguenga._) We have here a very black tree, a very black tombstone, and\r\na very black sky; the outline of the two former relieved by gleams of\r\nlight from a very full moon; and having gazed our fill on these\r\nmelancholy objects, are told that--\"In the street of Victory, at No.\r\n63-1/2, at all hours of the day, an individual is to be met with who\r\nundertakes to supply every description of cards or notes of invitation,\r\nwhether for funerals or any other kind of entertainment; he undertakes\r\nat the same time to serve those gentlemen who may honor him with their\r\norders, with the very best goods, &c.,\" after the approved fashion of\r\nadvertisers all over the globe.\r\n\r\nNatural history affords the Buenos-Ayreans great scope for their\r\nartistical genius. Don Federico Costa announces a grand spectacle of\r\nwild beasts; and that there may be no mistake about what he has to show,\r\nhe heralds his collections with the full-length portrait of an Uran-utan\r\n(_Orangutan_), which he describes as a native of Africa. This\r\ninteresting animal is seated on a bank, with a large stick in one hand,\r\nlooking over his shoulder, and displays an endless amount of fingers and\r\ntoes; the greater the number, the nearer, in Don Federico's opinion, the\r\ncreature's approach to humanity. There is a wonderful bit of shadow\r\nthrown from one of the Uran-utan's legs, which puts one in mind of the\r\nfootprint that so startled Robinson Crusoe; and, indeed, the general\r\nappearance of the animal is not unlike some of the earlier portraits of\r\nthat renowned mariner, only nature has done for the Uran-utan what art\r\nand goat-skins accomplished for the solitary of Juan Fernandez.\r\n\r\nThe moral attributes of Don Federico's pet are strongly insisted upon in\r\nthe advertisement,--his excellent disposition, the ingenuity of his\r\nmind, and (included in \"_la moral_\") the surprising dexterity with which\r\nhe scoops out the contents of a cocoa-nut \"in a manner most pleasing\r\n(_muy agradable_) to the beholders.\" His companions in captivity are\r\nporcupines, tiger-cats, ounces, armadillos, and a number of animals\r\nbearing local names, besides divers snakes of different colors, two\r\nthousand well-preserved insects, and, finally, (_por ultimo_,) a\r\ncollection of antiquities from Mexico. The price of admission is two\r\n_reales_--the universal shilling; and children, in Buenos Ayres, as in\r\nLondon, are admitted for half-price.\r\n\r\nA livelier turtle than that which is figured for the edification of the\r\ngourmands who frequent the Hotel of Liberty in the street of the 25th of\r\nMay, it would be difficult to find even in the celebrated cellars of\r\nLeadenhall-street. If we were wholly unacquainted with the domestic\r\nhabits of these scaly delicacies, we might easily imagine, from the\r\npicture here given, that the way a turtle gets over the ground is by\r\nflying, his outstretched feet and flippers serving him for wings. This\r\nadvertisement is brief,--on the principle that good wine needs no bush.\r\nWe are merely informed that turtle-soup, cutlets, and broiled fins, are\r\nto be had from mid-day till sunset. There is no occasion for the hotel\r\nproprietor to waste his money in commending wares such as these. The\r\npicture and the hour of consummation would have been enough.\r\n\r\nIt is well that invalids should be told, that at No. 76, in the Street\r\nof Maipu, the milk of an ass \"recently confined\" is always on sale; but\r\nthe woodcut attached to the advertisement makes the fact appear\r\ndoubtful; for a sturdier male animal than the \"burro\" there depicted,\r\nwas never painted by Morland or Gainsborough. This, however, may arise\r\nfrom the necessity which exists for one of a sort doing duty for all.\r\nBut there is another singularity in this advertisement. With no line to\r\nindicate a fresh subject, as is the case in every other instance, the\r\nportrait of the ass is always followed by the words \"Long live the\r\nConfederation! Death to the Unitarians!\" These lines have puzzled us;\r\nand we hesitate to give the only explanation that strikes us: something\r\ndisrespectful, in short, to the Confederation of Buenos Ayres.\r\n\r\nIt is not only the slaves that run away in that part of South America:\r\nthe infection extends to dogs, horses, and oxen, all of which, like\r\nCaliban, seem for ever on the look out to \"have a new master, get a new\r\nman,\" to hunt, ride, or drive them. There is a daily column, headed\r\n\"Perdida,\" in which long-tailed horses, with flowing manes, pointers in\r\nimmovable attitudes, for ever pointing, and sinister-looking\r\nbulls--thorough-paced gamblers, always ready for pitch-and-toss--are\r\nadvertised as having left their owners, who strive to win them back by\r\nrewards varying twenty to fifty dollars. In all these cases the missing\r\nanimals are described as having \"disappeared\" (_desaparecido_)--a mild\r\nterm for \"stolen;\" it being the Spanish custom to refrain from \"wounding\r\nears polite\"--except when the blood is up; then, indeed, they may take\r\nthe field against Uncle Toby's army, that swore so terribly in Flanders.\r\n\r\nThis delicate mode of appealing to the consciences of thieves--which,\r\ncarried fairly out, would probably bear a strong resemblance in the end\r\nto the politeness of Mr. Chucks--is extended to property of all kinds. A\r\nlarge watch, of the genus turnip, the hands pointing to half-past\r\neleven, the time, perhaps, when the robbery is supposed to have taken\r\nplace, and accompanied by the expressive word \"Ojo\" (look sharp) thrice\r\nrepeated, indicates, what the advertisement soon plainly tells, that\r\nfrom No. 69, in Emerald-street, there have \"disappeared\" a valuable lot\r\nof articles, which give a very good idea of the turn-out of a\r\nwell-mounted horseman in South America. There are, first, several pairs\r\nof large silver spurs--and a pair of Spanish spurs, when melted down,\r\nwould make a decent service of plate,--quite enough for a \"testimonial\"\r\nto ourselves; and then come braided headstalls and bridles, with twisted\r\nchains and cavessons of silver; the reins hung with silver-bells, and\r\ndecorated with silver bosses, and the bits and curbs heavily mounted\r\nwith the same costly metal. This robbery has been evidently \"a put-up\r\nthing,\" for there is no word of housebreaking,--merely a disappearance;\r\nand all silversmiths, pawnbrokers, and the public in general, are\r\nentreated (_se suplica a los, &c._) to detain the article, if offered,\r\nand a reward of two hundred dollars will be given. Perhaps the gentlemen\r\nwho caused the horses to disappear have taken this mode of procuring\r\ncaparisons!\r\n\r\nQuack-medicine vendors are not wanting in Buenos Ayres to render\r\nimportant services to humanity. Two magnificent cut-glass decanters,\r\ngigantic in proportion to a tree of wondrous virtues which stands\r\nbetween them, are stated to be full of a healing medicine, which will do\r\nthe business of all whom the faculty have given up or are otherwise\r\nincurable, as effectually as Parr's Life Pills or Holloway's Ointment.\r\nThe chief establishment for the sale of this elixir is very carefully\r\npointed out; and for the benefit of future travellers we may mention,\r\nthat it is to be found at No. 496 in the street of Cangallo, and in the\r\nvery last door on the left-hand side, behind the windmill; and that in\r\nthe court-yard of the house there is a garden filled with statues, of\r\nwhich the originals are probably defunct; but whether the elixir out of\r\nthe two large decanters had any thing to do with this apotheosis, we\r\nrefrain from conjecturing.\r\n\r\nThe preceding advertisements are the most noticeable for embellishment\r\nand style. The ordinary kind of wants are set forth with woodcuts and\r\ntext of a less striking kind, but almost all are illustrated. Wine has a\r\nbarrel for its sign; music, a violin; travelling, a carriage; gardening,\r\na flower-pot; upholstery, a chair; the cobbler's mystery, a top-boot;\r\nthe hatter's, a beaver; and the letter of lodgings, a house full of\r\nwindows. Not all of them are confined to the Spanish language, for there\r\nare many English merchants and traders; and to accommodate the last, a\r\nnotice like the following recommends the aforementioned Street of Piety:\r\n\r\n     \"To Det. To roms in altos one Squaz from the Place of\r\n     Victory.\"\r\n\r\nThe author of this announcement certainly had not achieved a victory\r\nover the English language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the London Examiner.\r\n\r\nGUIZOT AND MONTALEMBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greatest novelty now in Paris is a speech. Any specimen of oratory\r\nthat the police will first allow to be spoken, and then to be printed,\r\nis quite an attraction. Indeed there is but one remaining chance of\r\nperpetrating a speech, and that is by achieving your election as a\r\nmember of the Institute, or being appointed as an old member to welcome\r\nthe newly-elected academician. These are the only legitimate\r\nopportunities for making one's voice heard in public that M. Bonaparte's\r\ncode has left to the Frenchman.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this solitary permission on the part of the authorities,\r\nthe Paris journals have contained reports of two remarkable speeches,\r\nthe one uttered by Count Montalembert on his being elected to the seat\r\nin the Academy, rendered vacant by the death of M. Droz; the other\r\nspoken by M. Guizot, in the form of an address of welcome to the new\r\nacademician, M. de Montalembert. Now in the speeches of these, the first\r\nauthorized orators of the new despotic _regime_, we find so little to\r\nawaken the susceptibilities of even M. Bonaparte's police, that we have\r\nheard with unaffected wonder of the scissors of the censorship having\r\nbeen applied even to them. The philosophy of the speeches is terribly\r\nConservative. M. Bonaparte himself could have desired no other. If his\r\nhighness the President had embraced the two academicians after their\r\nspeeches, and decorated them with the Grand Cordon of his new Order, it\r\nwould have been but a tribute justly due to these lay preachers of\r\nabsolutism.\r\n\r\nEulogy of Droz was the theme which afforded Count Montalembert the\r\nopportunity to ventilate his opinions, as M. Guizot's theme was the\r\neulogy of Montalembert. Montalembert depicted how Droz, who had reached\r\nyouth at the commencement of the great revolution, joined in all its\r\ntheories, its hopes, and its excesses, anathematizing kings and priests,\r\nand believing in the happy and final reign of pure democracy; and how\r\nall this the same Droz lived to unlearn and to correct, and to settle\r\ndown as quiet and as arrant a Conservative as ever supported monarchic\r\ngovernment and a restored church. This is the true path of repentance,\r\nexclaimed Montalembert, and the only road to wisdom.\r\n\r\nThe compliment to tergiversation, which M. Montalembert thus paid to\r\nDroz, M. Guizot applied to Montalembert himself, whom he (M. Guizot) had\r\nremembered commencing his political career in full opposition,\r\nthundering against corrupt majorities, against kingly influence, and\r\neven against that want of spirit which preferred being at peace with\r\nneighbors to provoking them. But all that sort of constitutional\r\nopposition leads, as the people have seen, to the triumph of socialism;\r\nand so all wise people, like M. Montalembert, naturally become sick of\r\nit, and abandon it, betaking themselves for a preference to the old\r\npolitical religion of legitimacy and worship of absolutism. Of all the\r\nnational disgraces inflicted upon France by M. Bonaparte's triumph, we\r\nknow of none greater than such a hymn to servility, such anathemas and\r\nfarewells to constitutional freedom, uttered by these two Talleyrands of\r\nthe professorial and ecclesiastical schools, who have been changing\r\nprinciples all their lives, and now proclaim at last that absolutism is\r\nthe only anchor to hold by.\r\n\r\nOn one point M. Montalembert impugned the philosophy of M. Droz, and in\r\ndoing so impugned not less the opinion of M. Thiers, and most of the\r\neminent men who have written histories or judgments upon the great\r\nevents of the Revolution. Droz, relating these events in after life, saw\r\nin their march and series the influence of stern necessity. Such was the\r\ncongregated mass of evils of all kinds produced by the long\r\nmisgovernment of the despotism and corrupt regime of the Bourbons, that\r\na catastrophe like that of the Great Revolution was, according to Droz,\r\nnot to be avoided. No human power could stop it, no moderation, no\r\nwisdom. In its path men were like the mere vegetable growth of a valley\r\ndown which a torrent comes in inundation, sweeping all before it.\r\n\r\nBut M. Montalembert, for his own part, has another way of viewing the\r\nevents of the Revolution. He denies the doctrine of fatalism or of\r\nnecessity. He will not allow that the follies of the monarchy drew down\r\nafter them the crimes of the Republic as a natural consequence. He sees\r\nin all those events, on the contrary, a direct intervention of\r\nProvidence, who inflicted the sufferings of the Revolution upon the\r\nFrench simply as retribution for their crimes and a punishment for their\r\nsins. Providence, in the imagination of Count Montalembert, is a Nemesis\r\nwith sword and scourge in hand, exercising its chief duty in castigating\r\nhumanity; and thus doth the French Academy in the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century proclaim the philosophy of history.\r\n\r\nM. Guizot avoided the recognition of any assertion so extravagant as\r\nthis, and so very unfair to poor Jaques Bonhomme. The crimes of the old\r\nmonarchy were confined to the court, the clergy, the aristocracy, and\r\nthe financiers; whereas the poor peasant was ground to poverty, yet a\r\nproverbially honest and cheerful fellow amidst his ignorance and\r\nprivations. But, according to Montalembert, Providence sent the\r\nRevolution to punish the crimes of duchesses; and this Revolution\r\ndecimated, arrested, and sent to perish all over the world poor Jaques\r\nBonhomme. Was this justice? M. Guizot did not, as we say, endorse this\r\nportion of the Montalembert philosophy. But he warned the Count of\r\nhaving in his early life made one grand mistake, in allying religion\r\nwith liberalism, and putting the names of both combined on the banners\r\nof opposition. M. Guizot could hardly mean that religion, like fortune,\r\nshould be always on the side of the greatest number of battalions. For\r\nshould not this be the creed of M. Bonaparte, rather than of his\r\nillustrious Academicians?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Household Words.\r\n\r\nAN ACCOUNT OF SOME TREATMENT OF GOLD AND GEMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who visit the metal works of Birmingham naturally desire to know\r\nwhere the metals come from; and especially the precious metals. Among\r\nthe materials shown to the visitor, are drawers full of the brightest\r\nand cleanest gold; and ingots of silver, pure, or slightly streaked with\r\ncopper. We have handled to-day an ingot which contains, to ninety-two\r\nounces ten pennyweights of silver, seven ounces ten pennyweights of\r\ncopper. We ask whether the gold comes from California; but we find that\r\nit has just arrived--from a much nearer place--from a refinery next\r\ndoor. We hear high praises of the Californian gold. It is so pure that\r\nsome of it can be used, without refining, for second-rate articles. Some\r\nsmall black specks may be detected in it, certainly, though they are so\r\nfew and so minute, that the native gold is wrought in large quantities.\r\nBut what _is_ this neighboring refinery? Whence does it obtain the\r\nmetals it refines? Let us go and see.\r\n\r\nIt is a strange murky place; a dismal inclosure, with ugly sheds, and\r\nyards not more agreeable to the eye. Its beauties come out by degrees,\r\nas the understanding opens to comprehend the affairs of the\r\nestablishment. In the sheds, are ranges of musty-looking furnaces; some\r\ncold and gaping, others showing, through crevices, red signs of fire\r\nwithin. There are piles of blocks of coal, of burnt ladles and peels,\r\nand rivulets of black refuse, which has flowed out from the furnaces\r\ninto safe beds of red sand. In a special shed, is a black moist-looking\r\nheap of what appears to be filth, battened into the shape of a large\r\ncompost bed. A man is filling a barrow with this commodity, and\r\nsmoothing it down with loving care. And well he may; for this\r\ndespicable-looking dirt is the California of the concern! Here is their\r\ngold mine, and their silver mine, and their copper mine. In another\r\nshed, is a mill-stone on edge, revolving with the post to which it is\r\nfixed, to crush the material which is to be calcined. In the yard, we\r\nsee heaps of scoriae--the shining, heavy, glassy-looking fragments, which\r\ntell tales of the prodigious heat to which they have been subjected. We\r\nsee picks, and more ladles, and lanterns, and a most sordid-looking\r\nbonfire. A heap of refuse is burning on the stones; old rags, fragments\r\nof shoes, cinders, dust, and nails--the veriest sweepings that can be\r\nimagined. Something precious is there; but the mass must be burned to\r\nbecome manageable. The ashes will be swept up for the refinery.\r\n\r\nBut what is it that yields gold, and silver, and copper, and brass? What\r\nis that heap of dirt in the special shed? It is the sweepings of the\r\nBirmingham manufactories.\r\n\r\nWhat economy! In all goldsmiths' shops every effort is made to save all\r\nthe filings, and the minutest dust of the metals used. The floors are\r\nswept, and every thing recoverable is picked up. Yet the imperceptible\r\nloss is so valuable to the refiners, that they pay, and pay high, for\r\nthe scrapings, sweepings, and picking of the work-rooms. A cart load of\r\ndirt is taken from a fork-and-spoon manufactory to the refinery, and\r\npaid for on the instant; and the money thus received is one of the\r\nregular items in the books of the concern. Perhaps it pays the wages of\r\none of the workmen. Another establishment receives two hundred pounds a\r\nyear for its sweepings. It is worth noting these methods in concerns\r\nwhich are flourishing, and which have been raised to a prosperous\r\ncondition by pains and care; less flourishing people may be put in the\r\nway of similar methods. For instance, how good it would be for farmers\r\nif, instead of thinking there is something noble in disregard of\r\ntrifling economy, they could see the wisdom and beauty of an economy\r\nwhich hurts nobody, but benefits every body! It would do no one any good\r\nto throw away these scattered particles of precious metal, while their\r\npreservation affords a maintenance to many families. In the same way,\r\nthe waste of dead leaves, of animal manure, of odds and ends of time, of\r\nseed, of space in hedges, in the great majority of farms, does no good,\r\nand gives no pleasure to any body; while the same thrift on a farm that\r\nwe see in a manufactory, would sustain much life, bestow much comfort,\r\nnarrow no hearts, and expand the enjoyment of very many.\r\n\r\nWe must take care of our eyes when the ovens are opened--judging by the\r\nscarlet rays that peep out, here and there, from any small crevice.\r\nProdigious! What a heat it is, when, by the turn of a handle, a door of\r\nthe furnace is raised! The roasting, or calcining, to get rid of the\r\nsulphur, is going on here. The whole inside--walls, roof, embers, and\r\nall--are a transparent salmon-color. As a shovel, inserted from the\r\nopposite side, stirs and turns the burning mass, the sulphur appears\r\nabove--a little blue flame, and a great deal of yellow smoke. We feel\r\nsome of it in our throats. We exclaim about the intensity of the heat,\r\ndeclaring it tremendous. But we are told that it is not so; that, in\r\nfact, \"it is very cold--that furnace;\" which shows us that there is\r\nsomething hotter to come.\r\n\r\nThe Refiner's Test is pointed out to us;--a sort of shovel, with a\r\nspout, lined throughout with a material of burnt bones, the only\r\nsubstance which can endure unchanged the heat necessary for testing the\r\nmetals. Of this material are made the little crucibles that we see in\r\nthe furnaces, which our conductor admits to be \"rather warm.\" There they\r\nare, ranged in rows, so obscured by the mere heat, which confounds every\r\nthing in one glow, that their circular rims are only seen by being\r\nlooked for. Yet, one little orifice, at the back of this furnace, shows\r\nthat even this heat can be exceeded. That orifice is a point of white\r\nheat, revealed from behind. We do not see the metal in the crucibles;\r\nbut we know that it is simmering there.\r\n\r\nOne more oven is opened for us--the assay furnace, which is at a white\r\nheat. As the smallest quantities of metal serve for the assay, the\r\ncrucibles are here on the scale of dolls' tea-things. The whole concern\r\nof that smallest furnace looks like a pretty toy; but it is a very\r\nserious matter--the work it does, and the values it determines.\r\n\r\nThe metals, which run down to the bottom, in the melting furnaces, are\r\nseparated (the gold and silver by aquafortis), and cast in moulds,\r\ncoming out as ingots; or, in fragments, of any shape they may have\r\npleased to run into. Some of the gold fragments are of the cleanest and\r\nbrightest yellow. Other, no less pure, are dark and brownish. They are\r\nfor gilding porcelain. Lastly, we see a pretty curiosity. In the\r\ncounting-house, a little glass chamber is erected upon a counter, with\r\nan apparatus of great beauty--a pair of scales, thin and small to the\r\nlast degree, fastened by spider-like threads to a delicate beam, which\r\nis connected with an index, sensitive enough to show the variation of\r\nthe hundredth part of a grain. The glass walls exclude atmospheric\r\ndisturbance. Behind the rusty-looking doors were the white glowing\r\ncrucibles; within the drawers was the yellow gold; and, hidden in its\r\nglass house, was the fairy balance.\r\n\r\nNow, we will follow some of the gold and silver to a place where skilled\r\nhands are ready to work it curiously.\r\n\r\nFirst, however, we may as well mention, in confidence to our readers,\r\nthat our feelings are now and then wounded by the injustice of the world\r\nto the Birmingham manufacturers. We observe with pain, that the very\r\nvirtues of Birmingham manufacture are made matters of reproach. Because\r\nthe citizens have at their command extraordinary means of cheap\r\nproduction, and produce cheap goods accordingly, the world jumps to the\r\nconclusion that the work must be deceptive and bad. Fine gentlemen and\r\nladies give, in London shops, twice the price for Birmingham jewelry\r\nthat they would pay, if no middlemen stood, filling their pockets\r\nuncommonly fast, between them and the manufacturer; and they admire the\r\nsolid value and great beauty of the work; but, as soon as they know\r\nwhere the articles were wrought, they undervalue them with the term\r\n\"Brummagem.\" In the Great Exhibition there was a certain case of\r\ngold-work and jewelry, rich and thorough in material and workmanship.\r\nThe contents of that case were worth many hundred pounds. A gentleman\r\nand lady stopped to admire their contents. The lady was so delighted\r\nwith them that she supposed they must be French. The gentleman reminded\r\nher that they were in the British department. After a while, they\r\nobserved the label at the top of the case, and instantly retracted their\r\nadmiration. \"Oh!\" said the gentleman, pointing to the label, \"these are\r\nBrummagem ware--shams!\" Whatever may have been Brummagem-gold-beating in\r\nancient times, and in days of imperfect art when long wars impeded the\r\neducation of English taste, it is mere ignorance to keep up the censure\r\nin these times. It is merely accepting and retailing vulgar phrases\r\nwithout any inquiry, which is the stupidest form of ignorance. Perhaps\r\nsome of the prejudice may be removed by a brief account of what a\r\nBirmingham manufacture of gold chains is at this day.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago, the making of gold chains occupied a dozen or twenty\r\npeople in Birmingham. Now, the establishment we are entering, alone,\r\nemploys probably eight times that number. Formerly, a small master\r\nundertook the business in a little back shop: drew out his wire with his\r\nown hands; cut the devices himself; soldered the pieces himself; in\r\nshort, worked under the disadvantage of great waste of time, of effort,\r\nand of gold. Into the same shop more and more machinery has been since\r\nintroduced as it was gradually devised by clever heads. This machinery\r\nis made on the spot, and the whole is set to work by steam. Few things\r\nin the arts can be more striking than the contrast between the murky\r\nchambers where the forging and grinding--the Plutonic processes of\r\nmachine-making--are going on, and the upper chambers, light and quiet,\r\nwhere the delicate fingers of women and girls are arranging and\r\nfastening the cobweb links of the most delicate chain-work. The whole\r\nestablishment is most picturesque. While in some speculative towns in\r\nour island great warehouses and other edifices have sprung up too\r\nquickly, and are standing untenanted, a rising manufacture like this\r\ncannot find room. In the case before us, more room is preparing. A large\r\nsteam-engine will soon be at work, and the processes will be more\r\nconveniently connected. Mean time, house after house has been absorbed\r\ninto the concern. There are steps up here, and steps down there; and\r\ngalleries across courts; and long ranges of low-roofed chambers; and\r\nwooden staircases, in yards;--care being taken, however, to preserve in\r\nthe midst an isolated, well-lighted chamber, where part of the stock is\r\nkept, where some high officials abide, and where there are four counters\r\nor hatches, where the people present themselves outside, to receive\r\ntheir work. All this has grown out of the original little back-shop.\r\n\r\nBelow, there is a refinery. It is for the establishment alone; but, just\r\nlike that we have already described--only on a smaller scale. First, the\r\nrolling-mill shows us its powers by a speedy experiment;--it flattens a\r\nhalfpenny, making it oblong at the first turn, and, by degrees, with the\r\nhelp of some annealing in the furnace, drawing it out into a long ribbon\r\nof shining copper, which is rolled up, tied with a wire, and presented\r\nto us as a curiosity. Next, we see coils of thick round wire, of a dirty\r\nwhite, which we can hardly believe to be gold. It is gold, however, and\r\nis speedily drawn out into wire. Then, there are cutting, and piercing,\r\nand snipping machines--all bright and diligent; and the women and girls\r\nwho work them are bright and diligent too. Here, in this long room,\r\nlighted with lattices along the whole range, the machines stand, and the\r\nwomen sit, in a row--quiet, warm, and comfortable. Here we see sheets of\r\nsoft metal (for solder) cut into strips or squares; here, again, a woman\r\nis holding such a strip to a machine, and snipping the metal very fine,\r\ninto minute shreds, all alike. These are to be laid or stuck on little\r\njoins in the chain-work, or clasps, or swivel hinges, where soldering is\r\nrequired. Next, we find a dozen workwomen, each at her machine, pushing\r\nsnips of gold into grooves, where they are pierced with a pattern, or\r\none or two holes of a pattern, and made to fall into a receiver below.\r\nEach may take about a second of time. Farther on, slender gold wire is\r\ntwisted into links by myriads. At every seat the counter is cut out in a\r\nsemicircle, whereby room is saved, and the worker has a free use of her\r\narms. Under every such semicircle hangs a leathern pouch, to catch every\r\nparticle that falls, and to hold the tools. On shelves every where are\r\nranges of steel dies; and larger pieces of the metal, for massive links\r\nor for clasps, or for watch-keys and other ornaments, are stamped from\r\nthese. On the whole, we may say, that in these lower rooms the separate\r\npieces are prepared for being put together elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThat putting together appears to novices very blinding work; but, we are\r\nassured that it becomes so easy, by practice, that the girls could\r\nalmost do it with their eyes shut. In such a case we should certainly\r\nshut ours; for they ache with the mere sight of such poking and picking,\r\nand ranging of the white rings--all exactly like one another. They are\r\nranged in a groove of a plate of metal, or on a block of pumice-stone.\r\nWhen pricked into a precise row, they are anointed, at their points of\r\njunction, with borax. Each worker has a little saucer of borax, wet, and\r\nstirred with a camel-hair pencil. With this pencil she transfers a\r\nlittle of the borax to the flattened point of a sort of bodkin, and then\r\nanoints the links where they join. When the whole row is thus treated,\r\nshe turns on the gas, and, with a small blow-pipe, directs the flame\r\nupon the solder. It bubbles and spreads in the heat, and makes the row\r\nof links into a chain. There would be no end of describing the loops and\r\nhoops, and joints and embossings, which are soldered at these gas-pipes,\r\nafter being taken up by tiny tweezers, and delicately treated by all\r\nmanner of little tools. Suffice it, that here every thing is put\r\ntogether, and made ready for the finishing. In the middle of one room is\r\na counter, where is fixed the machine for twisting the chains--with its\r\ncog-wheels, and its nippers, whereby it holds one end of a portion of\r\nchain, while another is twisted, as the door-handle fixes the\r\nschoolboy's twine, while he knots or loops his pattern, or twists his\r\ncord. Here, a little girl stands, and winds a plain gold chain into this\r\nor that pattern, which depends upon the twisting.\r\n\r\nThese ornaments of precious metal do not look very ornamental at\r\npresent; being of the color of dirty soap-suds, and tossed together in\r\nheaps on the counters. We are now to see the hue and brightness of the\r\ngold brought out. We take up a chain, rather massive, and reminding us\r\nof some ornament we have somewhere seen; but it is so rough! and its\r\nflakes do not appear to fit upon each other. A man lays it along the\r\nlength of his left hand, and files it briskly; as he works, the soapy\r\nwhite disappears, the polish comes out, the parts fit together, and it\r\nis, presently, one of those flexible, scaly, smooth, glittering chains\r\nthat we have seen all our lives. Of course, the filings are dropped\r\ncarefully into a box, to go to the refinery. There is, here, a\r\nhome-invented and home-made apparatus for polishing and cutting topazes,\r\namethysts, bloodstones and the like, into shield shapes, for seals,\r\nwatch-keys, and ornaments of various kinds. The strongest man's arm must\r\ntire; but steam and steel need no consideration--so there go the wheels\r\nand the emery, smoothing and polishing infallibly; with a workman to\r\napply the article, and a boy to drop oil when screw or socket begins to\r\nscream. This polishing and filing was such severe work, in the lapidary\r\ndepartment, in former days, that the nervous energy of a man's arm was\r\ndestroyed--a serious grief to both worker and employer. At this day, it\r\nis understood that the lapidary is past work at forty, from the\r\ncontraction of the sinews of the wrist, consequent on the nature of his\r\nlabor. The period of disablement depends much on the habits of the men;\r\nbut, sooner or later, it is looked for as a matter of course. Here, the\r\nwear and tear is deputed to that which has no nerve. As the proprietor\r\nobserves, it requires no sympathy.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked how there comes to be any lapidary department here? Do\r\nwe never see gold chains the links whereof are studded with turquoises,\r\nor garnets, or little specks of emerald? Are there no ruby drops to\r\nladies' necklaces?--no jewelled toys hanging from gentlemen's\r\nwatch-guards? We see many of these pretty things here; besides cameos\r\nfor setting.\r\n\r\nAfter the delicate little filings (which must be done by hand) are all\r\nfinished, the articles must be well washed, dried in box-wood sawdust,\r\nand finally hand-polished with rouge. The people in one apartment look\r\ngrotesque enough--two women powdered over with rouge, and men of various\r\ndirty hues, all dressed alike, in an over-all garment of brown holland.\r\nA washerwoman is maintained on the establishment expressly to wash these\r\ndresses on the spot--her soap-suds being preserved, like all the other\r\nwashes, for the sake of the gold-dust contained in them. Her wash-tubs\r\nare emptied, like every thing else, into the refinery.\r\n\r\nIn the final burnishing room, we observe a row of chemists's\r\nglobes--glass vases filled with water, ranged on a shelf. A stranger\r\nmight guess long before he would find out what these are for. They are\r\nto reflect a concentrated blaze from the gas-lights in the evening, to\r\npoint out specks and dimnesses, to the eyes and fingers of the\r\nburnishers. What curious finger-ends they have--those women who chafe\r\nthe precious metals into their last degree of polish! They are\r\nbroad--the joint so flexible that it is bent considerably backwards when\r\nin use; and the skin has a peculiar smoothness: more mechanical, we\r\nfancy, than vital. However that may be, the burnish they produce is\r\nstrikingly superior to any hitherto achieved by friction with any other\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nIn departing, the sense of contrast comes over us once more. We have\r\njust seen all manner of elegancies in ornament, from the classical and\r\ndignified to the minute, fanciful, and grotesque; in going out, we give\r\na look to the unfinished engine-house, and the smiths' shop. All this\r\nhard work; all those many dwellings thrown into one establishment; all\r\nthese scores of men, and women, and children, busy from year's end to\r\nyear's end; all those diggers far away in California; all those\r\nlapidaries in Germany; all those engineers in their studies; all those\r\nironmasters in their markets; all those miners in the bowels of the\r\nearth--all are enlisted in making gold chains; and some of us have no\r\nmore knowledge and no more thought than to call the product \"Brummagem\r\nshams!\" Well! the price charged for them in London shops, where they are\r\nas good as French, is something real; and it is a real comfort to think\r\nhow swingingly some fine folks pay, though the bulk of the profit comes,\r\nnot to the manufacturer, but to the middlemen. Of these middlemen there\r\nare always two; the factor and the shopkeeper--often more. Their\r\nintervention is very useful, of course, or they would not exist; but\r\nsomebody or other makes a prodigious profit of Birmingham jewelry, after\r\nit has left the manufacturer's hands. It was only yesterday that we saw,\r\namong a rich heap of wonderful things, a pair of elegant\r\nbracelets--foreign pebbles, beautifully set. We were told the wholesale\r\nprice they were to be sold for; which was half the shop price. The\r\ntransference to the London shop was to cost as much as the whole of the\r\nprevious processes: from the digging of the silver and the collecting of\r\nthe pebbles, through all the needful voyages and travels, to the\r\nburnishing and packing at Birmingham!\r\n\r\nWe have seen, however, something which may throw a little light on the\r\nprejudice against Birmingham jewelry. It is not conceivable that any one\r\nshould despise such an establishment as we have been describing. But, we\r\nfound ourselves, the other day, passing through a little dwelling where\r\nthe housewife, with a baby on her arm, and where more than half-a-dozen\r\nchildren were housed; and then crossing a little yard, and mounting a\r\nflight of substantial brick steps with a stout hand-rail, and entering\r\nthe most curious little work-room we ever were in. It would just hold\r\nfour or five people, without allowing them room to turn round more than\r\none at a time. In one corner, was a very small stove. A lattice-window\r\nran along the whole front, and made it pleasant, light, and airy. A\r\nwork-bench or counter was scalloped out, in the same way as in larger\r\nestablishments, so as to accommodate three workers in the smallest\r\npossible space. The three workers had each his stool, his leathern pouch\r\non his knees, and his gas-pipe. A row of tools bristled along the whole\r\nlength of the lattice; and there was another row on a shelf behind. The\r\nprincipal workman was the father of those many children below. One son\r\nwas at work at his elbow, and the remaining workman was an apprentice.\r\nThis working jeweller was as thorough a gentleman, according to our\r\nnotions, as anybody we have seen for a long time past. Tall, stout, and\r\nhandsome; collar white and stiff; apron white and sound; his whole dress\r\nin good repair; his voice cheerful as his face; his manner open and\r\ncourteous; his information exactly what we wanted. We could not help\r\nwishing that some rural grandee, who avows that he hates all\r\nmanufacturers, could see this fair specimen of an English\r\nhandicraftsman. As for his work, he told us he supplies the factors to\r\norder. It would not answer for him to keep a stock. The factors would\r\nnot buy what he should offer, but dictate to him what he shall make.\r\nFashions change incessantly, and he has only to keep up with them as\r\nwell as he can. It is not for him to invent new patterns and get steel\r\ndies made for them; but to get the same steel dies that other makers are\r\nprocuring. These dies are, of course, for the metallic part of his work.\r\nThe boxes of lockets and hair brooches (now vehemently in fashion), and\r\ndevices, and colored stones, he procures at \"the French shops\" in the\r\ntown; and he showed us some variety of these, ready for setting. Then\r\ncame out the \"Brummagem\" feature of the case; showing us how the gold\r\nsetting that he was preparing--perforating and filing--was to be backed\r\nby a blue stone. He observed that it was not thought worth while to get\r\ncostly stones for a purpose like that; for blue glass would do as well.\r\nI certainly thought so, considering that the stone was to be only the\r\nback-ground of his work. Of the specimens I saw in that airy little\r\nworkshop, some were in excellent taste, and all, I believe, of good\r\nworkmanship. These small masters are as punctilious about employing only\r\nregularly qualified workmen, as any members of any guild in the country.\r\nTheir journeymen must all have served an apprenticeship; not only\r\nbecause they are thus best fitted for their business, but because the\r\nvalue of apprenticeship is thus kept up; and these small capitalists\r\nwill not part with the advantage of having journeymen, under the name of\r\napprentices, completely under their command during the last two or three\r\nyears of their term.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable sights, to those who knew Birmingham a\r\nquarter of a century ago, is such a manufacture as that of Messrs.\r\nParker and Acott's ever-pointed pencils. Those of us whose fathers were\r\nin business in the days of the war, when the arts were not flourishing,\r\nmay remember the bulky pocket-book, with its leather strap (always\r\nshabby after the first month), and its thick cedar pencil, which always\r\nwanted cutting; always blackening whatever came near it; always getting\r\nused up; the lead turning to dust at the most critical point of a\r\nmemorandum. There was a fine trade in cedar pencils at Keswick in those\r\ndays. It seemed a tale too romantic to be true, when we were told of\r\never-pointed pencils. First, we, of course, refused to believe in their\r\nexistence;--what improvement have we not refused to believe in? Then,\r\nwhen we found there was a screw in the case, and that the pencil was not\r\never-pointed by a vital action of its own, we were sure we should not\r\nlike it. We grew humble, and were certain we could never learn to manage\r\nit. And now, what have we not arrived at? We are so saucy as to look\r\nbeyond our improved pencils; beyond pen and ink; beyond our present\r\nneed of a cumbrous apparatus to carry about with us; ink that will spill\r\nand spot; leads that will break and use up; pens, paper, syllables,\r\nletters, pot-hooks, dots and crossings, and all the process of writing.\r\nPerhaps the electric telegraph has spoiled us: enabling us to imagine\r\nsome process by which thoughts may record themselves; some brief and\r\ncomplete method of making \"mems,\" without the complicated process of\r\nwriting down hundreds of letters, and scores of syllables, to preserve\r\none single idea. All this, however, is as romantic now as ever-pointed\r\npencils seemed to be at first; and instead of dreaming of what is not\r\nyet achieved, let us look at the reality before our eyes.\r\n\r\nHere is something wonderful enough, on our very entrance. Here is a\r\nsilver pencil-case, neat and serviceable, though not of the most elegant\r\nform; handsome enough to have been praised for its looks, thirty years\r\nago. This pencil-case carries two feet of lead. It is intended to be the\r\ncommercial traveller's joy and treasure. It will last him his life,\r\nunless he take an unconscionable amount of orders. Unscrewing the top,\r\nwe see that the upper end of the tube is divided into\r\ncompartments,--which look like the mouth of a revolver; and here,\r\nprotected from each other, the leads are bestowed, safe--despite their\r\ngreat length, through their owner's roughest travelling.\r\n\r\nSome drawers in a counter are pulled out. One is divided into\r\ncompartments, each of which holds a handful of something different from\r\nall the rest. This drawer contains one hundred gross of pencil-cases in\r\nparts; the tube, the rack and barrel, the propelling wire, the slide,\r\nthe top, the various chambers, and screws, and niceties. In another\r\ndrawer, there is a dazzling and beautiful heap of pure amethysts and\r\ntopazes from far countries, of vast aggregate value: and, farther on, we\r\nsee the elegant onyx and white cornelian from South America (a very\r\nrecent importation), and the sardonyx, now in high favor for seals and\r\nthe tops of pencil-cases. Its delicate layer of white upon red, (or the\r\nreverse,) the undermost color coming out in the engraving, makes it\r\nsingularly fit for the purpose. Then, there is a paperful of small\r\nturquoises, which are poured out and handled like a sample of lentils.\r\nThese are from Persia; and they have to be re-cut in England, the\r\nPersian tools being of the roughest. Then, there are bloodstones, and\r\npebbles out of number, and pints of glittering fragments of Californian\r\ngold; rich materials tossed together, to be drawn out for use at the\r\nbidding of capricious fashion; for, fashion seems to be as capricious\r\nhere, among these stones and ores that have required cycles of ages to\r\ncompose, as in the milliner's shop, where the materials are drawn from\r\nthe pods of a season and the insects of a summer. On shelves against the\r\nwalls, are ranged rows and piles of steel dies,--that pretty and costly\r\npiece of apparatus, which we find in almost all these\r\nmanufactories--together with the inexhaustible stamping and cutting\r\nmachines, the blow-pipe, the borax, and soft metal for solder, the\r\npumice-stone and wirebed, the turning wheel, the circular saw, and the\r\nbath of diluted aquafortis, and the pan of box-wood sawdust, in which\r\nthe pretty things are dried when they come out of \"pickle.\" From buttons\r\nto epergnes, we find this apparatus every where. The steel dies are an\r\neverlasting study: the block, like the conical weight of a pair of\r\nwarehouse scales, seeming very large for the little figure indented in\r\nthe upper surface. Here, in this manufactory, the figures are of the\r\nbugle, a favorite form of watch-key--the deer's foot, (a pretty study\r\nfor the same purpose,) and a large variety of patterns--the tulip, the\r\nacanthus, and other foliage, flowers or fruit, climbing up the summit of\r\nthe pencil-case, as if it were a little Corinthian capital.\r\n\r\nAnd now for the process. The silver or gold comes from the rolling-mill,\r\nand is passed in slips through a series of draw-plates, each smaller\r\nthan the last, and finally through the one which is to give it its\r\nfluted or other pattern. Soldering at the joint, filing away the\r\nroughness left by the solder, washing in an aquafortis bath come next. A\r\nslit for the slide is then made; the rims and screws and slides are\r\nadded, and you have a pencil-case complete. We observed that a large\r\nproportion of the tops are hexagonal, or of some angular form, to\r\nprevent their rolling off the table.\r\n\r\nSome of the pencil-cases are so small, and some of the watch-keys are so\r\nelaborate, that it requires a moment's consideration to decide which is\r\nwhich; and again, ladies' crochet-needles, of gold, diversely\r\nornamented, are very like pencil-cases. Some of each kind are specked\r\nover with turquoise or garnets; and all appear to be designed for\r\nornament, rather than for use. It is quite a relief to turn the eye upon\r\na shovelful of the yellow sawdust, where substantial pencil-cases, fit\r\nfor manly fingers, are drying. On the whole, perhaps, the most striking\r\nfeature is the prodigious extent of the production. We ask where all\r\nthese can possibly go; for a pencil-case is a thing which lasts half a\r\ncentury, as the manufacturer himself observes. These do not go to\r\nAmerica; for, in such things, the Americans are our chief rivals. They\r\nsupply their own wants, and a good deal more. We send our pencil-cases\r\nand trinkets over a good part of the world, however; and the caprice of\r\nfashion causes a great adventitious demand at home. In reply to our\r\nremark about this vast production, the manufacturer observes, \"Yes, we\r\ncut up gold and silver as the year comes in, and as the year goes out.\"\r\nSomething of a change, this, since the old days of cedar pencils!\r\n\r\nHere is a steel die with an elegant pyramidal pattern; the half of a\r\nwatch-key. We see the inch of metal stamped; and then another inch, for\r\nthe other half: and then the filing and snipping of the edges; and then\r\nthe laying in of the solder inside; and the binding together of the two\r\nhalves with wire; and the repose on the bed of wire on the pumice-stone,\r\nto be broiled red-hot; and the neat cleaning when cool; the polishing,\r\nand the leaving certain parts of the pattern dead, while others are\r\nburnished; and the firing of the steel cylinder at the point, and the\r\nturning of the rims. All this for a watch-key! But, we are shown\r\nanother, which does not look like anything very studied; and we are\r\ntold, and are at once convinced, that it consists of no less than\r\nthirteen parts. Other keys, which look more fanciful, consist of ten,\r\neight, or seven. None are the simple affair that a novice would suppose,\r\nnow that we require the convenience of being able to wind up our watches\r\nwithout twisting the chain or ribbon with every turn of the key.\r\n\r\nBut we must leave these niceties; the little pistols, the deers feet,\r\nthe bugle-horns, and all the dainty fancies embodied in watch-keys and\r\nknick-knacks. Here, as elsewhere, every atom is saved, of sweeping and\r\nwash; and we now find ourselves, writer and readers, like the materials\r\nof which we have been speaking, brought back, after all these various\r\nprocesses, to the refinery from which we set out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY NOVEL:\r\n\r\nOR, VARIETIES IN ENGLISH LIFE.[21]\r\n\r\nBY PISISTRATUS CAXTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK X.-INITIAL CHAPTER.\r\n\r\nIt is observed by a very pleasant writer--read now-a-days only by the\r\nbrave pertinacious few who still struggle hard to rescue from the House\r\nof Pluto the souls of departed authors, jostled and chased as those\r\nsouls are by the noisy footsteps of the living--it is observed by the\r\nadmirable Charron, that \"judgment and wisdom is not only the best, but\r\nthe happiest portion God Almighty hath distributed amongst men; for\r\nthough this distribution be made with a very uneven hand, yet nobody\r\nthinks himself stinted or ill-dealt with, but he that hath never so\r\nlittle is contented in _this_ respect.\"[22]\r\n\r\nAnd, certainly, the present narrative may serve in notable illustration\r\nof the remark so drily made by the witty and wise preacher. For whether\r\nour friend Riccabocca deduce theories for daily life from the great\r\nfolio of Machiavel; or that promising young gentleman, Mr. Randal\r\nLeslie, interpret the power of knowledge into the art of being too\r\nknowing for dull honest folks to cope with him; or acute Dick Avenel\r\npush his way up the social ascent with a blow for those before, and a\r\nkick for those behind him, after the approved fashion of your strong New\r\nMan; or Baron Levy--that cynical impersonation of Gold--compare himself\r\nto the Magnetic Rock in the Arabian tale, to which the nails in every\r\nship that approaches the influence of the loadstone fly from the planks,\r\nand a shipwreck per day adds its waifs to the Rock: questionless, at\r\nleast, it is, that each of those personages believed that Providence had\r\nbestowed on him an elder son's inheritance of wisdom. Nor, were we to\r\nglance towards the obscurer parts of life, should we find good Parson\r\nDale deem himself worse off than the rest of the world in this precious\r\ncommodity--as, indeed, he had signally evinced of late in that shrewd\r\nguess of his touching Professor Moss;--even plain Squire Hazeldean took\r\nit for granted that he could teach Audley Egerton a thing or two worth\r\nknowing in politics; Mr. Stirn thought that there was no branch of\r\nuseful lore on which he could not instruct the squire; and Sprott, the\r\ntinker, with his bag full of tracts and lucifer matches, regarded the\r\nwhole framework of modern society, from a rick to a constitution, with\r\nthe profound disdain of a revolutionary philosopher. Considering that\r\nevery individual thus brings into the stock of the world so vast a share\r\nof intelligence, it cannot but excite our wonder to find that Oxenstiern\r\nis popularly held to be right when he said, \"See, my son, how little\r\nwisdom it requires to govern states;\"--that is, men! That so many\r\nmillions of persons, each with a profound assurance that he is possessed\r\nof an exalted sagacity, should concur in the ascendency of a few\r\ninferior intellects, according to a few, stupid, prosy, matter-of-fact\r\nrules as old as the hills, is a phenomenon very discreditable to the\r\nspirit and energy of the aggregate human species! It creates no surprise\r\nthat one sensible watch-dog should control the movements of a flock of\r\nsilly grass-eating sheep; but that two or three silly grass-eating sheep\r\nshould give the law to whole flocks of such mighty sensible\r\nwatch-dogs--_Diavolo!_ Dr. Riccabocca, explain _that_, if you can! And\r\nwonderfully strange it is, that notwithstanding all the march of\r\nenlightenment, notwithstanding our progressive discoveries in the laws\r\nof nature--our railways, steam-engines, animal magnetism, and\r\nelectro-biology--we have never made any improvement that is generally\r\nacknowledged, since men ceased to be troglodytes and nomads, in the\r\nold-fashioned gamut of flats and sharps, which attunes into irregular\r\nsocial jog-trot all the generations that pass from the cradle to the\r\ngrave;--still, \"_the desire for something we have not_\" impels all the\r\nenergies that keep us in movement, for good or for ill, according to the\r\nchecks or the directions of each favorite desire.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine once said to a _millionaire_, whom he saw for ever\r\nengaged in making money which he never seemed to have any pleasure in\r\nspending, \"Pray, Mr.----, will you answer me one question: You are said\r\nto have two millions, and you spend L600 a-year. In order to rest and\r\nenjoy, what will content you?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little more,\" answered the _millionaire_.\r\n\r\nThat \"little more\" is the mainspring of civilization. Nobody ever gets\r\nit!\r\n\r\n\"Philus,\" saith a Latin writer, \"was not so rich as Laelius; Laelius was\r\nnot so rich as Scipio; Scipio was not so rich as Crassus: and Crassus\r\nwas not so rich--as he wished to be!\" If John Bull were once contented,\r\nManchester might shut up its mills. It is the \"little more\" that makes a\r\nmere trifle of the National Debt!--Long life to it!\r\n\r\nStill, mend our law-books as we will, one is forced to confess that\r\nknaves are often seen in fine linen, and honest men in the most shabby\r\nold rags; and still, notwithstanding the exceptions, knavery is a very\r\nhazardous game; and honesty, on the whole, by far the best policy.\r\nStill, most of the Ten Commandments remain at the core of all the\r\nPandects and Institutes that keep our hands off our neighbors' throats,\r\nwives, and pockets; still, every year shows that the parson's\r\nmaxim--_quieta non movere_--is as prudent for the health of communities\r\nas when Apollo recommended his votaries not to rake up a fever by\r\nstirring the Lake Camarina; still people, thank Heaven, decline to\r\nreside in parallelograms; and the surest token that we live under a free\r\ngovernment is, when we are governed by persons whom we have a full right\r\nto imply, by our censure and ridicule, are blockheads compared to\r\nourselves! Stop that delightful privilege, and, by Jove! sir, there is\r\nneither pleasure nor honor in being governed at all! You might as well\r\nbe--a Frenchman!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nThe Italian and his friend are closeted together.\r\n\r\n\"And why have you left your home in ----shire? And why this new change\r\nof name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Peschiera is in England.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And bent on discovering me; and, it is said, of stealing from me my\r\nchild.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has the assurance to lay wagers that he will win the hand of your\r\nheiress. I know that too; and therefore I have come to England--first to\r\nbaffle his design--for I do not think your fears are exaggerated--and\r\nnext to learn from you how to follow up a clue which, unless I am too\r\nsanguine, may lead to his ruin, and your unconditional restoration.\r\nListen to me. You are aware that, after the skirmish with Peschiera's\r\narmed hirelings sent in search of you, I received a polite message from\r\nthe Austrian government, requesting me to leave its Italian domains.\r\nNow, as I hold it the obvious duty of any foreigner, admitted to the\r\nhospitality of a state, to refrain from all participation in its civil\r\ndisturbances, so I thought my honor assailed at this intimation, and\r\nwent at once to Vienna to explain to the Minister there (to whom I was\r\npersonally known), that though I had, as became man to man, aided to\r\nprotect a refugee, who had taken shelter under my roof, from the\r\ninfuriated soldiers at the command of his private foe, I had not only\r\nnot shared in any attempt at revolt, but dissuaded, as far as I could,\r\nmy Italian friends from their enterprise; and that because, without\r\ndiscussing its merits, I believed, as a military man and a cool\r\nspectator, the enterprise could only terminate in fruitless bloodshed. I\r\nwas enabled to establish my explanation by satisfactory proof; and my\r\nacquaintance with the Minister assumed something of the character of\r\nfriendship. I was then in a position to advocate your cause, and to\r\nstate your original reluctance to enter into the plots of the\r\ninsurgents. I admitted freely that you had such natural desire for the\r\nindependence of your native land, that, had the standard of Italy been\r\nboldly hoisted by its legitimate chiefs, or at the common uprising of\r\nits whole people, you would have been found in the van, amidst the ranks\r\nof your countrymen; but I maintained that you would never have shared in\r\na conspiracy frantic in itself, and defiled by the lawless schemes and\r\nsordid ambition of its main projectors, had you not been betrayed and\r\ndecoyed into it by the misrepresentations and domestic treachery of your\r\nkinsman--the very man who denounced you. Unfortunately, of this\r\nstatement I had no proof but your own word. I made, however, so far an\r\nimpression in your favor, and, it may be, against the traitor, that your\r\nproperty was not confiscated to the State, nor handed over, upon the\r\nplea of your civil death, to your kinsman.\"\r\n\r\n\"How, I do not understand. Peschiera has the property?\"\r\n\r\n\"He holds the revenues but of one half upon pleasure, and they would be\r\nwithdrawn, could I succeed in establishing the case that exists against\r\nhim. I was forbidden before to mention this to you; the Minister, not\r\ninexcusably, submitted you to the probation of unconditional exile. Your\r\ngrace might depend upon your own forbearance from farther\r\nconspiracies--forgive the word. I need not say I was permitted to return\r\nto Lombardy. I found, on my arrival, that--that your unhappy wife had\r\nbeen to my house, and exhibited great despair at hearing of my\r\ndeparture.\"\r\n\r\nRiccabocca knit his dark brows, and breathed hard.\r\n\r\n\"I did not judge it necessary to acquaint you with this circumstance,\r\nnor did it much affect me. I believed in her guilt--and what could now\r\navail her remorse, if remorse she felt? Shortly afterwards I heard that\r\nshe was no more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" muttered Riccabocca, \"she died in the same year that I left\r\nItaly. It must be a strong reason that can excuse a friend for reminding\r\nme even that she once lived!\"\r\n\r\n\"I come at once to that reason,\" said L'Estrange gently. \"This autumn I\r\nwas roaming through Switzerland, and, in one of my pedestrian excursions\r\namidst the mountains, I met with an accident, which confined me for some\r\ndays to a sofa at a little inn in an obscure village. My hostess was an\r\nItalian; and as I had left my servant at a town at some distance, I\r\nrequired her attention till I could write to him to come to me. I was\r\nthankful for her cares, and amused by her Italian babble. We became very\r\ngood friends. She told me she had been servant to a lady of great rank,\r\nwho had died in Switzerland; and that, being enriched by the generosity\r\nof her mistress, she had married a Swiss innkeeper, and his people had\r\nbecome hers. My servant arrived, and my hostess learned my name, which\r\nshe did not know before. She came into my room greatly agitated. In\r\nbrief, this woman had been servant to your wife. She had accompanied her\r\nto my villa, and known of her anxiety to see me, as your friend. The\r\ngovernment had assigned to your wife your palace at Milan, with a\r\ncompetent income. She had refused to accept of either. Failing to see\r\nme, she had set off towards England, resolved upon seeing yourself; for\r\nthe journals had stated that to England you had escaped.\"\r\n\r\n\"She dared!--shameless! And see, but a moment before, I had forgotten\r\nall but her grave in a foreign soil--and these tears had forgiven her,\"\r\nmurmured the Italian.\r\n\r\n\"Let them forgive her still,\" said Harley, with all his exquisite\r\nsweetness of look and tone. \"I resume. On entering Switzerland, your\r\nwife's health, which you know was always delicate, gave way. To fatigue\r\nand anxiety succeeded fever, and delirium ensued. She had taken with her\r\nbut this one female attendant--the sole one she could trust--on leaving\r\nhome. She suspected Peschiera to have bribed her household. In the\r\npresence of this woman she raved of her innocence--in accents of terror\r\nand aversion, denounced your kinsman--and called on you to vindicate her\r\nname and your own.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ravings indeed! Poor Paulina!\" groaned Riccabocca, covering his face\r\nwith both hands.\r\n\r\n\"But in her delirium there were lucid intervals. In one of these she\r\nrose, in spite of all her servant could do to restrain her, took from\r\nher desk several letters, and reading them over, exclaimed piteously,\r\n'But how to get them to him?--whom to trust? And his friend is gone!'\r\nThen an idea seemed suddenly to flash upon her, for she uttered a joyous\r\nexclamation, sat down, and wrote long and rapidly; inclosed what she\r\nwrote, with all the letters, in one packet, which she sealed carefully,\r\nand bade her servant carry to the post, with many injunctions to take it\r\nwith her own hand, and pay the charge on it. 'For, oh!' said she (I\r\nrepeat the words as my informant told them to me)--'for, oh, this is my\r\nsole chance to prove to my husband that, though I have erred, I am not\r\nthe guilty thing he believes me; the sole chance, too, to redeem my\r\nerror, and restore, perhaps, to my husband his country, to my child her\r\nheritage.' The servant took the letter to the post; and when she\r\nreturned, her lady was asleep, with a smile upon her face. But from that\r\nsleep she woke again delirious, and before the next morning her soul had\r\nfled.\" Here Riccabocca lifted one hand from his face, and grasped\r\nHarley's arm, as if mutely beseeching him to pause. The heart of the man\r\nstruggled hard with his pride and his philosophy; and it was long before\r\nHarley could lead him to regard the worldly prospects which this last\r\ncommunication from his wife might open to his ruined fortunes. Not,\r\nindeed, till Riccabocca had persuaded himself, and half persuaded\r\nHarley, (for strong, indeed, was all presumption of guilt against the\r\ndead,) that his wife's protestations of innocence from all but error had\r\nbeen but ravings.\r\n\r\n\"Be this as it may,\" said Harley, \"there seems every reason to suppose\r\nthat the letters inclosed were Peschiera's correspondence, and that, if\r\nso, these would establish the proof of his influence over your wife, and\r\nof his perfidious machinations against yourself. I resolved, before\r\ncoming hither, to go round by Vienna. There I heard with dismay that\r\nPeschiera had not only obtained the imperial sanction to demand your\r\ndaughter's hand, but had boasted to his profligate circle that he should\r\nsucceed; and he was actually on his road to England. I saw at once that\r\ncould this design, by any fraud or artifice, be successful with\r\nViolante, (for of your consent, I need not say, I did not dream,) the\r\ndiscovery of this packet, whatever its contents, would be useless: his\r\nend would be secured. I saw also that his success would suffice for ever\r\nto clear his name; for his success must imply your consent, (it would be\r\nto disgrace your daughter, to assert that she had married without it,)\r\nand your consent would be his acquittal. I saw, too, with alarm, that to\r\nall means for the accomplishment of his project he would be urged by\r\ndespair; for his debts are great, and his character nothing but new\r\nwealth can support. I knew that he was able, bold, determined, and that\r\nhe had taken with him a large supply of money, borrowed upon usury;--in\r\na word, I trembled for you both. I have now seen your daughter, and I\r\ntremble no more. Accomplished seducer as Peschiera boasts himself, the\r\nfirst look upon her face, so sweet yet so noble, convinced me that she\r\nis proof against a legion of Peschieras. Now, then, return we to this\r\nall-important subject--to this packet. It never reached you. Long years\r\nhave passed since then. Does it exist still? Into whose hands would it\r\nhave fallen? Try to summon up all your recollections. The servant could\r\nnot remember the name of the person to whom it was addressed; she only\r\ninsisted that the name began with a B, that it was directed to England,\r\nand that to England she accordingly paid the postage. Whom, then, with a\r\nname that begins with B, or (in case the servant's memory here misled\r\nher) whom did you or your wife know, during your visit to England, with\r\nsufficient intimacy to make it probable that she would select such a\r\nperson for her confidant?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot conceive,\" said Riccabocca, shaking his head. \"We came to\r\nEngland shortly after our marriage. Paulina was affected by the climate.\r\nShe spoke not a word of English, and indeed not even French as might\r\nhave been expected from her birth, for her father was poor, and\r\nthoroughly Italian. She refused all society. I went, it is true,\r\nsomewhat into the London world--enough to induce me to shrink from the\r\ncontrast that my second visit as a beggared refugee would have made to\r\nthe reception I met with on my first--but I formed no intimate\r\nfriendships. I recall no one whom she could have written to as intimate\r\nwith me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" persisted Harley, \"think again. Was there no lady well acquainted\r\nwith Italian, and with whom, perhaps, for that very reason, your wife\r\nbecame familiar?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, it is true. There was one old lady of retired habits, but who had\r\nbeen much in Italy. Lady--Lady--I remember--Lady Jane Horton.\"\r\n\r\n\"Horton--Lady Jane!\" exclaimed Harley; \"again! thrice in one day--is\r\nthis wound never to scar over?\" Then, noting Riccabocca's look of\r\nsurprise, he said, \"Excuse me, my friend; I listen to you with renewed\r\ninterest. Lady Jane was a distant relation of my own; she judged me,\r\nperhaps harshly--and I have some painful associations with her name; but\r\nshe was a woman of many virtues. Your wife knew her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not, however, intimately--still, better than any one else in London.\r\nBut Paulina would not have written to her; she knew that Lady Jane had\r\ndied shortly after her own departure from England. I myself was summoned\r\nback to Italy on pressing business; she was too unwell to journey with\r\nme as rapidly as I was obliged to travel; indeed, illness detained her\r\nseveral weeks in England. In this interval she might have made\r\nacquaintances. Ah, now I see; I guess. You say the name began with B.\r\nPaulina, in my absence, engaged a companion; it was at my suggestion--a\r\nMrs. Bertram. This lady accompanied her abroad. Paulina became\r\nexcessively attached to her, she knew Italian so well. Mrs. Bertram left\r\nher on the road, and returned to England, for some private affairs of\r\nher own. I forget why or wherefore; if, indeed, I ever asked or learned.\r\nPaulina missed her sadly, often talked of her, wondered why she never\r\nheard from her. No doubt it was to this Mrs. Bertram that she wrote!\"\r\n\r\n\"And you don't know the lady's friends or address?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor who recommended her to your wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably Lady Jane Horton?\"\r\n\r\n\"It may be so. Very likely.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will follow up this track, slight as it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if Mrs. Bertram received the communication, how comes it that it\r\nnever reached--O, fool that I am, how should it! I, who guarded so\r\ncarefully my incognito!\"\r\n\r\n\"True. This your wife could not foresee; she would naturally imagine\r\nthat your residence in England would be easily discovered. But many\r\nyears must have passed since your wife lost sight of this Mrs. Bertram,\r\nif their acquaintance was made so soon after your marriage; and now it\r\nis a long time to retrace--long before even your Violante was born.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! yes. I lost two fair sons in the interval. Violante was born to\r\nme as the child of sorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"And to make sorrow lovely! how beautiful she is!\"\r\n\r\nThe father smiled proudly.\r\n\r\n\"Where, in the loftiest house of Europe, find a husband worthy of such a\r\nprize?\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget that I am still an exile--she still dowerless. You forget\r\nthat I am pursued by Peschiera; that I would rather see her a beggar's\r\nwife--than--Pah, the very thought maddens me, it is so foul. _Corpo di\r\nBacco!_ I have been glad to find her a husband already.\"\r\n\r\n\"Already! Then that young man spoke truly?\"\r\n\r\n\"What young man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Randal Leslie. How! You know him?\" Here a brief explanation followed.\r\nHarley heard with attentive ear, and marked vexation, the particulars of\r\nRiccabocca's connection and implied engagement with Leslie.\r\n\r\n\"There is something very suspicious to me in all this,\" said he. \"Why\r\nshould this young man have so sounded me as to Violante's chance of\r\nlosing fortune if she married an Englishman?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he? O, pooh! excuse him. It was but his natural wish to seem\r\nignorant of all about me. He did not know enough of my intimacy with you\r\nto betray my secret.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he knew enough of it--must have known enough to have made it right\r\nthat he should tell you I was in England. He does not seem to have done\r\nso.\"\r\n\r\n\"No--_that_ is strange; yet scarcely strange--for, when we last met, his\r\nhead was full of other things--love and marriage. _Basta!_ youth will\r\nbe youth.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has no youth left in him!\" exclaimed Harley, passionately. \"I doubt\r\nif he ever had any. He is one of those men who come into the world with\r\nthe pulse of a centenarian. You and I never shall be as old--as he was\r\nin long-clothes. Ah, you may laugh; but I am never wrong in my\r\ninstincts. I disliked him at the first--his eye, his smile, his voice,\r\nhis very footstep. It is madness in you to countenance such a marriage;\r\nit may destroy all chance of your restoration.\"\r\n\r\n\"Better that than infringe my word once passed.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" exclaimed Harley; \"your word is not passed--it shall not be\r\npassed. Nay, never look so piteously at me. At all events, pause till we\r\nknow more of this young man. If he be worthy of her without a dower,\r\nwhy, then, let him lose you your heritage. I should have no more to\r\nsay.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why lose me my heritage?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think the Austrian government would suffer your estates to pass\r\nto this English jackanapes, a clerk in a public office? O, sage in\r\ntheory, why are you such a simpleton in action?\"\r\n\r\nNothing moved by this taunt, Riccabocca rubbed his hands, and then\r\nstretched them comfortably over the fire.\r\n\r\n\"My friend,\" said he, \"the heritage would pass to my son--a dowry only\r\ngoes to the daughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you have no son.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush! I am going to have one; my Jemima informed me of it yesterday\r\nmorning; and it was upon that information that I resolved to speak to\r\nLeslie. Am I a simpleton now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Going to have a son,\" repeated Harley, looking very bewildered; \"how do\r\nyou know it is to be a son?\"\r\n\r\n\"Physiologists are agreed,\" said the sage positively, \"that where the\r\nhusband is much older than the wife, and there has been a long interval\r\nwithout children before she condescends to increase the population of\r\nthe world--she (that is, it is at least as nine to four)--she brings\r\ninto the world a male. I consider that point, therefore, as settled,\r\naccording to the calculations of statistics and the researches of\r\nnaturalists.\"\r\n\r\nHarley could not help laughing, though he was still angry and disturbed.\r\n\r\n\"The same man as ever; always the fool of philosophy.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Cospetto!_\" said Riccabocca, \"I am rather the philosopher of fools.\r\nAnd talking of that, shall I present you to my Jemima?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but in turn I must present you to one who remembers with gratitude\r\nyour kindness, and whom your philosophy, for a wonder, has not ruined.\r\nSome time or other you must explain that to me. Excuse me for a moment;\r\nI will go for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"For him;--for whom? In my position I must be cautious; and--\"\r\n\r\n\"I will answer for his faith and discretion. Meanwhile, order dinner,\r\nand let me and my friend stay to share it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dinner? _Corpo di Bacco!_--not that Bacchus can help us here. What will\r\nJemima say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Henpecked man, settle that with your connubial tyrant. But dinner it\r\nmust be.\"\r\n\r\nI leave the reader to imagine the delight of Leonard at seeing once more\r\nRiccabocca unchanged, and Violante so improved; and the kind Jemima,\r\ntoo. And their wonder at him and his history, his books and his fame. He\r\nnarrated his struggles and adventures with a simplicity that removed\r\nfrom a story so personal the character of egotism. But when he came to\r\nspeak of Helen, he was brief and reserved.\r\n\r\nViolante would have questioned more closely; but, to Leonard's relief,\r\nHarley interposed.\r\n\r\n\"You shall see her whom he speaks of, before long, and question her\r\nyourself.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, Harley turned the young man's narrative into new\r\ndirections; and Leonard's words again flowed freely. Thus the evening\r\npassed away, happily to all save Riccabocca. But the thought of his dead\r\nwife rose ever and anon before him; and yet when it did, and became too\r\npainful, he crept nearer to Jemima, and looked in her simple face, and\r\npressed her cordial hand. And yet the monster had implied to Harley that\r\nhis comforter was a fool--so she was, to love so contemptible a\r\nslanderer of herself, and her sex.\r\n\r\nViolante was in a state of blissful excitement; she could not analyze\r\nher own joy. But her conversation was chiefly with Leonard; and the most\r\nsilent of all was Harley. He sat listening to Leonard's warm, yet\r\nunpretending eloquence--that eloquence which flows so naturally from\r\ngenius, when thoroughly at its ease, and not chilled back on itself by\r\nhard, unsympathizing hearers--listened, yet more charmed, to the\r\nsentiments less profound, yet no less earnest--sentiments so feminine,\r\nyet so noble, with which Violante's fresh virgin heart responded to the\r\npoet's kindling soul. Those sentiments of hers were so unlike all he\r\nheard in the common world--so akin to himself in his gone youth!\r\nOccasionally--at some high thought of her own, or some lofty line from\r\nItalian song, that she cited with lighted eyes and in melodious\r\naccents--occasionally he reared his knightly head, and his lips\r\nquivered, as if he had heard the sound of a trumpet. The inertness of\r\nlong years was shaken. The Heroic, that lay deep beneath all the humors\r\nof his temperament, was reached, appealed to; and stirred within him,\r\nrousing up all the bright associations connected with it, and long\r\ndormant. When he rose to take leave, surprised at the lateness of the\r\nhour, Harley said, in a tone that bespoke the sincerity of the\r\ncompliment, \"I thank you for the happiest hours I have known for\r\nyears.\" His eye dwelt on Violante as he spoke. But timidity returned to\r\nher with his words--at his look; and it was no longer the inspired muse,\r\nbut the bashful girl that stood before him.\r\n\r\n\"And when shall I see you again?\" asked Riccabocca disconsolately,\r\nfollowing his guest to the door.\r\n\r\n\"When? Why, of course, to-morrow. Adieu! my friend. No wonder you have\r\nborne your exile so patiently,--with such a child!\"\r\n\r\nHe took Leonard's arm, and walked with him to the inn where he had left\r\nhis horse. Leonard spoke of Violante with enthusiasm. Harley was silent.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nThe next day a somewhat old-fashioned, but exceedingly patrician,\r\nequipage stopped at Riccabocca's garden-gate. Giacomo, who, from a\r\nbedroom window, had caught sight of it winding towards the house, was\r\nseized with undefinable terror when he beheld it pause before their\r\nwalls and heard the shrill summons at the portal. He rushed into his\r\nmaster's presence, and implored him not to stir--not to allow any one to\r\ngive ingress to the enemies the machine might disgorge. \"I have heard,\"\r\nsaid he, \"how a town in Italy--I think it was Bologna--was once taken\r\nand given to the sword, by incautiously admitting a wooden horse, full\r\nof the troops of Barbarossa, and all manner of bombs and Congreve\r\nrockets.\"\r\n\r\n\"The story is differently told in Virgil,\" quoth Riccabocca, peeping out\r\nof the window. \"Nevertheless, the machine looks very large and\r\nsuspicious; unloose Pompey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Father,\" said Violante, coloring, \"it is your friend, Lord L'Estrange;\r\nI hear his voice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite. How can I be mistaken?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go, then, Giacomo; but take Pompey with thee--and give the alarm if we\r\nare deceived.\"\r\n\r\nBut Violante was right; and in a few moments Lord L'Estrange was seen\r\nwalking up the garden, and giving the arm to two ladies.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said Riccabocca, composing his dressing-robe round him, \"go, my\r\nchild, and summon Jemima. Man to man; but, for Heaven's sake, woman to\r\nwoman.\"\r\n\r\nHarley had brought his mother and Helen, in compliment to the ladies of\r\nhis friend's household.\r\n\r\nThe proud Countess knew that she was in the presence of Adversity, and\r\nher salute to Riccabocca was only less respectful than that with which\r\nshe would have rendered homage to her sovereign. But Riccabocca, always\r\ngallant to the sex that he pretended to despise, was not to be outdone\r\nin ceremony; and the bow which replied to the curtsey would have edified\r\nthe rising generation, and delighted such surviving relicts of the old\r\nCourt breeding as may linger yet amidst the gloomy pomp of the Faubourg\r\nSt. Germain. These dues paid to etiquette, the Countess briefly\r\nintroduced Helen, as Miss Digby, and seated herself near the exile. In a\r\nfew moments the two elder personages became quite at home with each\r\nother; and really, perhaps, Riccabocca had never, since we have known\r\nhim, showed to such advantage as by the side of his polished, but\r\nsomewhat formal visitor. Both had lived so little with our modern,\r\nill-bred age! They took out their manners of a former race with a sort\r\nof pride in airing once more such fine lace and superb brocade.\r\nRiccabocca gave truce to the shrewd but homely wisdom of his\r\nproverbs--perhaps he remembered that Lord Chesterfield denounces\r\nproverbs as vulgar;--and gaunt though his figure, and far from elegant\r\nthough his dressing-robe, there was that about him which spoke\r\nundeniably of the _grand seigneur_--of one to whom a Marquis de Dangeau\r\nwould have offered a _fauteuil_ by the side of the Rohans and\r\nMontmorencies.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Helen and Harley seated themselves a little apart, and were\r\nboth silent--the first from timidity; the second, from abstraction. At\r\nlength the door opened, and Harley suddenly sprang to his feet--Violante\r\nand Jemima entered. Lady Lansmere's eyes first rested on the daughter,\r\nand she could scarcely refrain from an exclamation of admiring surprise;\r\nbut then, when she caught sight of Mrs. Riccabocca's somewhat humble,\r\nyet not obsequious mien--looking a little shy, a little homely, yet\r\nstill thoroughly a gentlewoman, (though of your plain rural kind of that\r\ngenus)--she turned from the daughter, and with the _savoir vivre_ of the\r\nfine old school, paid her first respects to the wife; respects\r\nliterally, for her manner implied respect,--but it was more kind,\r\nsimple, and cordial than the respect she had shown to Riccabocca;--as\r\nthe sage himself had said, here \"it was Woman to Woman.\" And then she\r\ntook Violante's hand in both hers, and gazed on her as if she could not\r\nresist the pleasure of contemplating so much beauty. \"My son,\" she said\r\nsoftly, and with a half sigh--\"my son in vain told me not to be\r\nsurprised. This is the first time I have ever known reality exceed\r\ndescription!\"\r\n\r\nViolante's blush here made her still more beautiful; and as the Countess\r\nreturned to Riccabocca, she stole gently to Helen's side.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Digby, my ward,\" said Harley pointedly, observing that his mother\r\nhad neglected her duty of presenting Helen to the ladies. He then\r\nreseated himself, and conversed with Mrs. Riccabocca; but his bright\r\nquick eye glanced ever at the two girls. They were about the same\r\nage--and youth was all that, to the superficial eye, they seemed to have\r\nin common. A greater contrast could not well be conceived; and, what is\r\nstrange, both gained by it. Violante's brilliant lovelieness seemed yet\r\nmore dazzling, and Helen's fair gentle face yet more winning. Neither\r\nhad mixed much with girls of her own age; each took to the other at\r\nfirst sight. Violante, as the less shy, began the conversation.\r\n\r\n\"You are his ward--Lord L'Estrange's?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you came with him from Italy?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not exactly. But I have been in Italy for some years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! you regret--nay, I am foolish--you return to your native land. But\r\nthe skies in Italy are so blue--here it seems as if nature wanted\r\ncolors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord L'Estrange says that you were very young when you left Italy; you\r\nremember it well. He, too, prefers Italy to England.\"\r\n\r\n\"He! Impossible!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why impossible, fair skeptic?\" cried Harley, interrupting himself in\r\nthe midst of a speech to Jemima.\r\n\r\nViolante had not dreamed that she could be overheard--she was speaking\r\nlow; but, though visibly embarrassed, she answered distinctly--\r\n\r\n\"Because in England there is the noblest career for noble minds.\"\r\n\r\nHarley was startled, and replied with a slight sigh, \"At your age I\r\nshould have said as you do. But this England of ours is so crowded with\r\nnoble minds, that they only jostle each other, and the career is one\r\ncloud of dust.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, I have read, seems a battle to the common soldier, but not to the\r\nchief.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have read good descriptions of battles, I see.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Riccabocca, who thought this remark a taunt upon her\r\ndaughter-in-law's studies, hastened to Violante's relief.\r\n\r\n\"Her papa made her read the history of Italy, and I believe that is full\r\nof battles.\"\r\n\r\n_Harley._--\"All history is, and all women are fond of war and of\r\nwarriors. I wonder why.\"\r\n\r\n_Violante_, (turning to Helen, and in a very low voice, resolved that\r\nHarley should not hear this time.)--\"We can guess why--can we not?\"\r\n\r\n_Harley_, (hearing every word, as if it had been spoken in St. Paul's\r\nWhispering Gallery.)--\"If you can guess, Helen, pray tell me.\"\r\n\r\n_Helen_, (shaking her pretty head, and answering with a livelier smile\r\nthan usual.)--\"But I am not fond of war and warriors.\"\r\n\r\n_Harley_ to Violante.--\"Then I must appeal at once to you,\r\nself-convicted Bellona that you are. Is it from the cruelty natural to\r\nthe female disposition?\"\r\n\r\n_Violante_, (with a sweet musical laugh.)--\"From two propensities still\r\nmore natural to it.\"\r\n\r\n_Harley._--\"You puzzle me: what can they be?\"\r\n\r\n_Violante._--\"Pity and admiration; we pity the weak, and admire the\r\nbrave.\"\r\n\r\nHarley inclined his head, and was silent.\r\n\r\nLady Lansmere had suspended her conversation with Riccabocca to listen\r\nto this dialogue. \"Charming!\" she cried. \"You have explained what has\r\noften perplexed me. Ah, Harley, I am glad to see that your satire is\r\nfoiled: you have no reply to that.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I willingly own myself defeated--too glad to claim the Signorina's\r\npity, since my cavalry sword hangs on the wall, and I can have no longer\r\na professional pretence to her admiration.\"\r\n\r\nHe then rose, and glanced towards the window. \"But I see a more\r\nformidable disputant for my conqueror to encounter is coming into the\r\nfield--one whose profession it is to substitute some other romance for\r\nthat of camp and siege.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our friend Leonard,\" said Riccabocca, turning his eye also towards the\r\nwidow. \"True; as Quevedo says wittily, 'Ever since there has been so\r\ngreat a demand for type, there has been much less lead to spare for\r\ncannon-balls.'\"\r\n\r\nHere Leonard entered. Harley had sent Lady Lansmere's footman to him\r\nwith a note, that prepared him to meet Helen. As he came into the room,\r\nHarley took him by the hand, and led him to Lady Lansmere.\r\n\r\n\"The friend of whom I spoke. Welcome him now for my sake, ever after for\r\nhis own;\" and then, scarcely allowing time for the Countess's elegant\r\nand gracious response, he drew Leonard towards Helen. \"Children,\" said\r\nhe, with a touching voice, that thrilled through the hearts of both, \"go\r\nand seat yourselves yonder, and talk together of the past. Signorina, I\r\ninvite you to renewed discussion upon the abstruse metaphysical subject\r\nyou have started; let us see if we cannot find gentler sources for pity\r\nand admiration than war and warriors.\" He took Violante aside to the\r\nwindow. \"You remember that Leonard, in telling you his history last\r\nnight, spoke, you thought, rather too briefly of the little girl who had\r\nbeen his companion in the rudest time of his trials. When you would have\r\nquestioned more, I interrupted you, and said, 'You should see her\r\nshortly, and question her yourself.' And now what think you of Helen\r\nDigby? Hush, speak low. But her ears are not so sharp as mine.\"\r\n\r\n_Violante_--\"Ah! that is the fair creature whom Leonard called his\r\nchild-angel? What a lovely innocent face!--the angel is there still.\"\r\n\r\n_Harley_, (pleased both at the praise and with her who gave it.)--\"You\r\nthink so, and you are right. Helen is not communicative. But fine\r\nnatures are like fine poems--a glance at the first two lines suffices\r\nfor a guess into the beauty that waits you, if you read on.\"\r\n\r\nViolante gazed on Leonard and Helen as they sat apart. Leonard was the\r\nspeaker, Helen the listener; and though the former had, in his narrative\r\nthe night before, been indeed brief as to the episode in his life\r\nconnected with the orphan, enough had been said to interest Violante in\r\nthe pathos of their former position towards each other, and in the\r\nhappiness they must feel in their meeting again--separated for years on\r\nthe wide sea of life, now both saved from the storm and shipwreck. The\r\ntears came into her eyes. \"True,\" she said very softly, \"there is more\r\nhere to move pity and admiration than in\"--She paused.\r\n\r\n_Harley._--\"Complete the sentence. Are you ashamed to retract? Fie on\r\nyour pride and obstinacy.\"\r\n\r\n_Violante._--\"No; but even here there have been war and heroism--the war\r\nof genius with adversity, and heroism in the comforter who shared it and\r\nconsoled. Ah! wherever pity and admiration are both felt, something\r\nnobler than mere sorrow must have gone before: the heroic must exist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Helen does not know what the word heroic means,\" said Harley, rather\r\nsadly; \"you must teach her.\"\r\n\r\nIs it possible, thought he as he spoke, that a Randal Leslie could have\r\ncharmed this grand creature? No \"Heroic\" surely, in that sleek young\r\nplaceman. \"Your father,\" he said aloud, and fixing his eyes on her face,\r\n\"sees much, he tells me, of a young man, about Leonard's age, as to\r\ndate; but I never estimate the age of men by the parish register; and I\r\nshould speak of that so-called young man as a contemporary of my\r\ngreat-grandfather; I mean Mr. Randal Leslie. Do you like him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like him?\" said Violante slowly, and as if sounding her own mind. \"Like\r\nhim--yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" asked Harley, with dry and curt indignation.\r\n\r\n\"His visits seem to please my dear father. Certainly, I like him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hum. He professes to like you, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\nViolante laughed, unsuspiciously. She had half a mind to reply, \"Is that\r\nso strange!\" But her respect for Harley stopped her. The words would\r\nhave seemed to her pert.\r\n\r\n\"I am told he is clever,\" resumed Harley.\r\n\r\n\"O, certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he is rather handsome. But I like Leonard's face better.\"\r\n\r\n\"Better--that is not the word. Leonard's face is as that of one who has\r\ngazed so often upon heaven; and Mr. Leslie's--there is neither sunlight\r\nnor starlight reflected there.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Violante!\" exclaimed Harley, overjoyed; and he pressed her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nThe blood rushed over the girl's cheek and brow; her hand trembled in\r\nhis. But Harley's familiar exclamation might have come from a father's\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Helen softly approached them, and looking timidly into\r\nher guardian's face, said, \"Leonard's mother is with him: he asks me to\r\ncall and see her. May I?\"\r\n\r\n\"May you! A pretty notion the Signorina must form of your enslaved state\r\nof pupilage, when she hears you ask that question. Of course you may.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you take me there?\"\r\n\r\nHarley looked embarrassed. He thought of the widow's agitation at his\r\nname; of that desire to shun him, which Leonard had confessed, and of\r\nwhich he thought he divined the cause. And, so divining, he too shrank\r\nfrom such a meeting.\r\n\r\n\"Another time, then,\" said he, after a pause.\r\n\r\nHelen looked disappointed, but said no more.\r\n\r\nViolante was surprised at this ungracious answer. She would have blamed\r\nit as unfeeling in another. But all that Harley did was right in her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"Cannot I go with Miss Digby?\" said she, \"and my mother will go too. We\r\nboth know Mrs. Fairfield. We shall be so pleased to see her again.\"\r\n\r\n\"So be it,\" said Harley; \"I will wait here with your father till you\r\ncome back. Oh, as to my mother, she will excuse the--excuse Madame\r\nRiccabocca, and you too. See how charmed she is with _your_ father. I\r\nmust stay to watch over the conjugal interests of _mine_.\"\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Riccabocca had too much good old country breeding to leave the\r\nCountess; and Harley was forced himself to appeal to Lady Lansmere. When\r\nhe had explained the case in point, the Countess rose and said--\r\n\r\n\"But I will call myself, with Miss Digby.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Harley, gravely, but in a whisper. \"No--I would rather not. I\r\nwill explain later.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the Countess aloud, after a glance of surprise at her son,\r\n\"I must insist on your performing this visit, my dear Madam, and you,\r\nSignorina. In truth, I have something to say confidentially to--\"\r\n\r\n\"To me,\" interrupted Riccabocca. \"Ah, Madame la Comtesse, you restore me\r\nto five-and-twenty. Go, quick--O jealous and injured wife; go, both of\r\nyou, quick; and you, too, Harley.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay,\" said Lady Lansmere, in the same tone, \"Harley must stay, for my\r\ndesign is not at present upon destroying your matrimonial happiness,\r\nwhatever it may be later. It is a design so innocent that my son will be\r\na partner in it.\"\r\n\r\nHere the Countess put her lips to Harley's ear, and whispered. He\r\nreceived her communication in attentive silence; but when she had done,\r\npressed her hand, and bowed his head, as if an assent to a proposal.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes, the three ladies and Leonard were on their road to the\r\nneighboring cottage.\r\n\r\nViolante, with her usual delicate intuition, thought that Leonard and\r\nHelen must have much to say to each other; and ignorant, as Leonard\r\nhimself was, of Helen's engagement to Harley, began already, in the\r\nromance natural to her age, to predict for them happy and united days in\r\nthe future. So she took her step-mother's arm, and left Helen and\r\nLeonard to follow.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder,\" she said, musingly, \"how Miss Digby became Lord L'Estrange's\r\nward, I hope she is not very rich, nor very high-born.\"\r\n\r\n\"La, my love,\" said the good Jemima, \"that is not like you; you are not\r\nenvious of her, poor girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"Envious! Dear mamma, what a word! But don't you think Leonard and Miss\r\nDigby seem born for each other? And then the recollections of their\r\nchildhood--the thoughts of childhood are so deep, and its memories so\r\nstrangely soft!\" The long lashes drooped over Violante's musing eyes as\r\nshe spoke. \"And therefore,\" she said after a pause \"therefore I hoped\r\nthat Miss Digby might not be very rich, nor very high-born.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand you now, Violante,\" exclaimed Jemima, her own early\r\npassion for match-making instantly returning to her; \"for as Leonard,\r\nhowever clever and distinguished, is still the son of Mark Fairfield the\r\ncarpenter, it would spoil all if Miss Digby was, as you say, rich and\r\nhigh-born. I agree with you--a very pretty match--a very pretty match,\r\nindeed. I wish dear Mrs. Dale were here now she is so clever in settling\r\nsuch matters.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Leonard and Helen walked side by side a few paces in the rear.\r\nHe had not offered her his arm. They had been silent hitherto since they\r\nleft Riccabocca's house.\r\n\r\nHelen now spoke first. In similar cases it is generally the woman, be\r\nshe ever so timid, who does speak first. And here Helen was the bolder:\r\nfor Leonard did not disguise from himself the nature of his feelings,\r\nand Helen was engaged to another; and her pure heart was fortified by\r\nthe trust reposed in it.\r\n\r\n\"And have you ever heard more of the good Dr. Morgan, who had powders\r\nagainst sorrow, and who meant to be so kind to us--though,\" she added,\r\ncoloring, \"we did not think so then?\"\r\n\r\n\"He took my child-angel from me,\" said Leonard, with visible emotion;\r\n\"and if she had not returned, where and what should I be now? But I have\r\nforgiven him. No, I have never met him since.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that terrible Mr. Burley?\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor, poor Burley! He, too, is vanished out of my present life. I have\r\nmade many inquiries after him; all I can hear is that he went abroad,\r\nsupposed as a correspondent to some journal. I should like so much to\r\nsee him again, now that perhaps I could help him as he helped me.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Helped_ you--ah!\"\r\n\r\nLeonard smiled with a beating heart, as he saw again the dear, prudent,\r\nwarning look, and involuntarily drew closer to Helen. She seemed more\r\nrestored to him and to her former self.\r\n\r\n\"Helped me much by his instructions; more, perhaps, by his very faults.\r\nYou cannot guess, Helen--I beg pardon, Miss Digby--but I forgot that we\r\nare no longer children: you cannot guess how much we men, and, more than\r\nall perhaps, we writers, whose task it is to unravel the web of human\r\nactions, owe even to our own past errors; and if we learn nothing by the\r\nerrors of others, we should be dull indeed. We must know where the roads\r\ndivide, and have marked where they lead to, before we can erect our\r\nsign-posts; and books are the sign-posts in human life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Books!--And I have not yet read yours. And Lord L'Estrange tells me you\r\nare famous now. Yet you remember me still--the poor orphan child, whom\r\nyou first saw weeping at her father's grave, and with whom you burdened\r\nyour own young life, over-burdened already. No, still call me Helen--you\r\nmust always be to me--a brother! Lord L'Estrange feels _that_; he said\r\nso to me when he told me that we were to meet again. He is so generous,\r\nso noble. Brother!\" cried Helen, suddenly, and extending her hand, with\r\na sweet but sublime look in her gentle face--\"brother, we will never\r\nforfeit his esteem; we will both do our best to repay him? Will we\r\nnot--say so?\"\r\n\r\nLeonard felt overpowered by contending and unanalyzed emotions. Touched\r\nalmost to tears by the affectionate address--thrilled by the hand that\r\npressed his own--and yet with a vague fear, a consciousness that\r\nsomething more than the words themselves was implied--something that\r\nchecked all hope. And this word \"brother,\" once so precious and so dear,\r\nwhy did he shrink from it now?--why could he not too say the sweet word\r\n\"sister?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is above me now and evermore,\" he thought, mournfully; and the\r\ntones of his voice, when he spoke again, were changed. The appeal to\r\nrenewed intimacy but made him more distant; and to that appeal itself he\r\nmade no direct answer; for Mrs. Riccabocca, now turning round, and\r\npointing to the cottage which came in view, with its picturesque gable\r\nends, cried out--\r\n\r\n\"But is that your house, Leonard? I never saw any thing so pretty.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not remember it then,\" said Leonard to Helen, in accents of\r\nmelancholy reproach \"there where I saw you last! I doubted whether to\r\nkeep it exactly as it was, and I said, No! the association is not\r\nchanged because we try to surround it with whatever beauty we can\r\ncreate: the dearer the association, the more the Beautiful becomes to it\r\nnatural.' Perhaps you don't understand this--perhaps it is only we poor\r\npoets who do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand it,\" said Helen, gently. She looked wistfully at the\r\ncottage.\r\n\r\n\"So changed--I have so often pictured it to myself--never, never like\r\nthis; yet I loved it, commonplace as it was to my recollection; and the\r\ngarret, and the tree in the carpenter's yard.\"\r\n\r\nShe did not give these thoughts utterance. And they now entered the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fairfield was a proud woman when she received Mrs. Riccabocca and\r\nViolante in her grand house; for a grand house to her was that cottage\r\nto which her boy Lenny had brought her home. Proud, indeed, ever was\r\nWidow Fairfield; but she thought then in her secret heart, that if ever\r\nshe could receive in the drawing-room of that grand house the great Mrs.\r\nHazeldean, who had so lectured her for refusing to live any longer in\r\nthe humble tenement rented of the Squire, the cup of human bliss would\r\nbe filled, and she could contentedly die of the pride of it. She did not\r\nmuch notice Helen--her attention was too absorbed by the ladies who\r\nrenewed their old acquaintance with her, and she carried them all over\r\nthe house, yea, into the very kitchen; and so, somehow or other, there\r\nwas a short time when Helen and Leonard found themselves alone. It was\r\nin the study. Helen had unconsciously seated herself in Leonard's own\r\nchair, and she was gazing with anxious and wistful interest, on the\r\nscattered papers, looking so disorderly (though, in truth, in that\r\ndisorder there was method, but method only known to the owner), and at\r\nthe venerable, well-worn books, in all languages, lying on the floor, on\r\nthe chairs--any where. I must confess that Helen's first tidy woman-like\r\nidea was a great desire to arrange the latter. \"Poor Leonard,\" she\r\nthought to herself--\"the rest of the house so neat, but no one to take\r\ncare of his own room and of him!\"\r\n\r\nAs if he divined her thought, Leonard smiled, and said, \"It would be a\r\ncruel kindness to the spider, if the gentlest hand in the world tried to\r\nset its cobweb to rights.\"\r\n\r\n_Helen._--\"You were not quite so bad in the old days.\"\r\n\r\n_Leonard._--\"Yet even then, you were obliged to take care of the money.\r\nI have more books now, and more money. My present housekeeper lets me\r\ntake care of the books, but she is less indulgent as to the money.\"\r\n\r\n_Helen_, (archly.)--\"Are you as absent as ever?\"\r\n\r\n_Leonard._--\"Much more so, I fear. The habit is incorrigible, Miss\r\nDigby--\"\r\n\r\n_Helen._--\"Not Miss Digby--sister, if you like.\"\r\n\r\n_Leonard_, (evading the word that implied so forbidden an\r\naffinity.)--\"Helen, will you grant me a favor? Your eyes and your smile\r\nsay 'yes.' Will you lay aside, for one minute, your shawl and bonnet?\r\nWhat! can you be surprised that I ask it? Can you not understand that I\r\nwish for one minute to think you are at home again under this roof?\"\r\n\r\nHelen cast down her eyes, and seemed troubled; then she raised them,\r\nwith a soft angelic candor in their dovelike blue, and, as if in shelter\r\nfrom all thoughts of more warm affection, again murmured \"_brother_,\"\r\nand did as he asked her.\r\n\r\nSo there she sat, amongst the dull books, by his table, near the open\r\nwindow--her fair hair parted on her forehead--looking so good, so calm,\r\nso happy! Leonard wondered at his own self-command. His heart yearned to\r\nher with such inexpressible love--his lips so longed to murmur--\"Ah, as\r\nnow so could it be for ever! Is the home too mean?\" But that word\r\n\"brother\" was as a talisman between her and him.\r\n\r\nYet she looked so at home--perhaps so at home she felt!--more certainly\r\nthan she had yet learned to do in that stiff stately house in which she\r\nwas soon to have a daughter's rights. Was she suddenly made aware of\r\nthis--that she so suddenly arose--and with a look of alarm and distress\r\non her face--\r\n\r\n\"But--we are keeping Lady Lansmere too long,\" she said, falteringly. \"We\r\nmust go now,\" and she hastily took up her shawl and bonnet.\r\n\r\nJust then Mrs. Fairfield entered with the visitors, and began making\r\nexcuses for inattention to Miss Digby, whose identity with Leonard's\r\nchild-angel she had not yet learned.\r\n\r\nHelen received these apologies with her usual sweetness. \"Nay,\" she\r\nsaid, \"your son and I are such old friends, how could you stand on\r\nceremony with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Old friends!\" Mrs. Fairfield stared amazed, and then surveyed the fair\r\nspeaker more curiously than she had yet done. \"Pretty, nice spoken\r\nthing,\" thought the widow; \"as nice spoken as Miss Violante, and\r\nhumbler-looking-like--though, as to dress, I never see any thing so\r\nelegant out of a picter.\"\r\n\r\nHelen now appropriated Mrs. Riccabocca's arm; and after a kind\r\nleave-taking with the widow, the ladies returned towards Riccabocca's\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fairfield, however, ran after them with Leonard's hat and gloves,\r\nwhich he had forgotten.\r\n\r\n\"'Deed, boy,\" said she kindly, yet scoldingly, \"but there'd be no more\r\nfine books, if the Lord had not fixed your head on your shoulders. You\r\nwould not think it, marm,\" she added to Mrs. Riccabocca, \"but sin' he\r\nhas left you, he's not the 'cute lad he was; very helpless at times,\r\nmarm!\"\r\n\r\nHelen could not resist turning round, and looking at Leonard, with a sly\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nThe widow saw the smile, and catching Leonard by the arm, whispered,\r\n\"But, where before have you seen that pretty young lady? Old friends!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, mother,\" said Leonard, sadly, \"it is a long tale; you have heard\r\nthe beginning, who can guess the end?\"--and he escaped. But Helen still\r\nleant on the arm of Mrs. Riccobocca, and, in the walk back, it seemed to\r\nLeonard as if the winter had resettled in the sky.\r\n\r\nYet he was by the side of Violante, and she spoke to him with such\r\npraise of Helen! Alas! it is not always so sweet as folks say, to hear\r\nthe praises of one we love. Sometimes those praises seem to ask\r\nironically, \"And what right hast thou to hope because thou lovest? _All_\r\nlove _her_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Lady Lansmere found herself alone with Riccabocca and\r\nHarley than she laid her hand on the exile's arm, and, addressing him by\r\na title she had not before given him, and from which he appeared to\r\nshrink nervously, said--\"Harley, in bringing me to visit you, was forced\r\nto reveal to me your incognito, for I should have discovered it. You may\r\nnot remember me, in spite of your gallantry. But I mixed more in the\r\nworld than I do now, during your first visit to England, and once sat\r\nnext to you at dinner at Carlton House. Nay, no compliments, but listen\r\nto me. Harley tells me you have cause for some alarm respecting the\r\ndesigns of an audacious and unprincipled--adventurer, I may call him;\r\nfor adventurers are of all ranks. Suffer your daughter to come to me, on\r\na visit, as long as you please. With me, at least, she will be safe; and\r\nif you, too, and the--\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop, my dear madam,\" interrupted Riccabocca, with great vivacity,\r\n\"your kindness overpowers me. I thank you most gratefully for your\r\ninvitation to my child; but--\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay,\" in his turn interrupted Harley, \"no buts. I was not aware of my\r\nmother's intention when she entered this room. But since she whispered\r\nit to me, I have reflected on it, and am convinced that it is but a\r\nprudent precaution. Your retreat is known to Mr. Leslie--he is known to\r\nPeschiera. Grant that no indiscretion of Mr. Leslie's betray the secret;\r\nstill I have reason to believe that the Count guesses Randal's\r\nacquaintance with you. Audley Egerton this morning told me he had\r\ngathered that, not from the young man himself, but from questions put to\r\nhimself by Madame di Negra; and Peschiera might, and would, set spies,\r\nto track Leslie to every house that he visits--might and would, still\r\nmore naturally, set spies to track myself. Were this man an Englishman,\r\nI should laugh at his machinations; but he is an Italian, and has been a\r\nconspirator. What he could do, I know not; but an assassin can penetrate\r\ninto a camp, and a traitor can creep through closed walls to one's\r\nhearth. With my mother, Violante must be safe; that you cannot oppose.\r\nAnd why not come yourself?\"\r\n\r\nRiccabocca had no reply to these arguments, so far as they affected\r\nViolante; indeed, they awakened the almost superstitious terror with\r\nwhich he regarded his enemy, and he consented at once that Violante\r\nshould accept the invitation proffered. But he refused it for himself\r\nand Jemima.\r\n\r\n\"To say truth,\" said he simply, \"I made a secret vow, on re-entering\r\nEngland, that I would associate with none who knew the rank I had\r\nformerly held in my own land. I felt that all my philosophy was needed,\r\nto reconcile and habituate myself to my altered circumstances. In order\r\nto find in my present existence, however humble, those blessings which\r\nmake all life noble--dignity and peace--it was necessary for poor, weak\r\nhuman nature, wholly to dismiss the past. It would unsettle me sadly,\r\ncould I come to your house, renew a while, in your kindness and\r\nrespect--nay, in the very atmosphere of your society--the sense of what\r\nI have been; and then (should the more than doubtful chance of recall\r\nfrom my exile fail me) to awake, and find myself for the rest of\r\nlife--what I am. And though, were I alone, I might trust myself perhaps\r\nto the danger--yet my wife: she is happy and contented now; would she be\r\nso, if you had once spoiled her for the simple position of Dr.\r\nRiccabocca's wife? Should I not have to listen to regrets, and hopes,\r\nand fears that would prick sharp through my thin cloak of philosophy?\r\nEven as it is, since in a moment of weakness I confided my secret to\r\nher, I have had 'my rank' thrown at me--with a careless hand, it is\r\ntrue--but it hits hard, nevertheless. No stone hurts like one taken from\r\nthe ruins of one's own home; and the grander the home, why, the heavier\r\nthe stone! Protect, dear madam--protect my daughter, since her father\r\ndoubts his own power to do so. But--ask no more.\"\r\n\r\nRiccabocca was immovable here. And the matter was settled as he decided,\r\nit being agreed that Violante should be still styled the daughter of Dr.\r\nRiccabocca.\r\n\r\n\"And now, one word more,\" said Harley. \"Do not confide to Mr. Leslie\r\nthese arrangements; do not let him know where Violante is placed--at\r\nleast, until I authorize such confidence in him. It is sufficient\r\nexcuse, that it is no use to know unless he called to see her, and his\r\nmovements, as I said before, may be watched. You can give the same\r\nreason to suspend his visits to yourself. Suffer me, meanwhile, to\r\nmature my judgment on this young man. In the mean while also, I think\r\nthat I shall have means of ascertaining the real nature of Peschiera's\r\nschemes. His sister has sought to know me; I will give her the occasion.\r\nI have heard some things of her in my last residence abroad, which make\r\nme believe that she cannot be wholly the Count's tool in any schemes\r\nnakedly villanous; that she has some finer qualities in her than I once\r\nsupposed; and that she can be won from his influence. It is a state of\r\nwar; we will carry it into the enemy's camp. You will promise me, then,\r\nto refrain from all further confidence to Mr. Leslie.\"\r\n\r\n\"For the present, yes,\" said Riccabocca, reluctantly.\r\n\r\n\"Do not even say that you have seen me, unless he first tell you that I\r\nam in England, and wish to learn your residence. I will give him full\r\noccasion to do so. Pish! don't hesitate; you know your own proverb--\r\n\r\n    'Boccha chiusa, ed occhio aperto\r\n    Non fece mai nissun deserto.'\r\n\r\n'The closed mouth and the open eye,' &c.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's very true,\" said the Doctor, much struck. \"Very true. '_In\r\nbocchac hiusa non c'entrano mosche_.' One can't swallow flies if one\r\nkeeps one's mouth shut. _Corpo di Bacco!_ that's very true!\"\r\n\r\nHarley took aside the Italian.\r\n\r\n\"You see if our hope of discovering the lost packet, or if our belief in\r\nthe nature of its contents, be too sanguine, still, in a few months it\r\nis possible that Peschiera can have no further designs on your\r\ndaughter--possible that a son may be born to you, and Violante would\r\ncease to be in danger, because she would cease to be an heiress. Indeed,\r\nit may be well to let Peschiera know this chance; it would, at least,\r\nmake him delay all his plans while we are tracking the document that may\r\ndefeat them for ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no! for heaven's sake, no!\" exclaimed Riccabocca, pale as ashes.\r\n\"Not a word to him. I don't mean to impute to him crimes of which he may\r\nbe innocent. But he meant to take my life when I escaped the pursuit of\r\nhis hirelings in Italy. He did not hesitate, in his avarice, to denounce\r\na kinsman; expose hundreds to the sword, if resisting--to the dungeon,\r\nif passive. Did he know that my wife might bear me a son, how can I tell\r\nthat his designs might not change into others still darker, and more\r\nmonstrous, than those he now openly parades, though, after all, not more\r\ninfamous and vile? Would my wife's life be safe? Not more difficult to\r\nconvey poison into my house, than to steal my child from my hearth.\r\nDon't despise me; but when I think of my wife, my daughter, and that\r\nman, my mind forsakes me: I am one fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, this apprehension is too exaggerated. We do not live in the age of\r\nthe Borgias. Could Peschiera resort to the risks of a murder, it is for\r\nyourself that you should fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"For myself!--I! I!\" cried the exile, raising his tall stature to its\r\nfull height. \"Is it not enough degradation to a man who has borne the\r\nname of such ancestors, to fear for those he loves! Fear for myself! Is\r\nit you who ask if I am a coward?\"\r\n\r\nHe recovered himself as he felt Harley's penitential and admiring grasp\r\nof the hand.\r\n\r\n\"See,\" said he, turning to the Countess with a melancholy smile, \"how\r\neven one hour of your society destroys the habits of years. Dr.\r\nRiccabocca is talking of his ancestors!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nViolante and Jemima were both greatly surprised, as the reader may\r\nsuppose, when they heard, on their return, the arrangements already made\r\nfor the former. The Countess insisted on taking her at once, and\r\nRiccabocca briefly said, \"Certainly, the sooner the better.\" Violante\r\nwas stunned and bewildered. Jemima hastened to make up a little bundle\r\nof things necessary, with many a woman's sigh that the poor wardrobe\r\ncontained so few things befitting. But among the clothes she slipped a\r\npurse, containing the savings of months, perhaps of years, and with it a\r\nfew affectionate lines, begging Violante to ask the Countess to buy her\r\nall that was proper for her father's child. There is always something\r\nhurried and uncomfortable in the abrupt and unexpected withdrawal of any\r\nmember from a quiet household. The small party broke into still smaller\r\nknots. Violante hung on her father, and listened vaguely to his not very\r\nlucid explanations. The Countess approached Leonard, and according to\r\nthe usual mode of persons of quality addressing young authors,\r\ncomplimented him highly on the books she had not read, but which her son\r\nassured her were so remarkable. She was a little anxious to know where\r\nHarley had met with Mr. Oran, whom he called his friend; but she was too\r\nhigh-bred to inquire, or to express any wonder that rank should be\r\nfriends with genius.\r\n\r\nShe took it for granted that they had formed their acquaintance abroad.\r\n\r\nHarley conversed with Helen. \"You are not sorry that Violante is coming\r\nto us? She will be just such a companion for you as I could desire; of\r\nyour own years too.\"\r\n\r\n_Helen_, (ingenuously.)--\"It is hard to think I am not younger than she\r\nis.\"\r\n\r\n_Harley._--\"Why, my dear Helen?\"\r\n\r\n_Helen._--\"She is so brilliant. She talks so beautifully. And I--\"\r\n\r\n_Harley._--\"And you want but the habit of talking, to do justice to your\r\nown beautiful thoughts.\"\r\n\r\nHelen looked at him gratefully, but shook her head. It was a common\r\ntrick of hers, and always when she was praised.\r\n\r\nAt last the preparations were made--the farewell was said. Violante was\r\nin the carriage by Lady Lansmere's side. Slowly moved on the stately\r\nequipage with its four horses and trim postillions, heraldic badges on\r\ntheir shoulders, in the style rarely seen in the neighborhood of the\r\nmetropolis, and now fast vanishing even amidst distant counties.\r\n\r\nRiccabocca, Jemima, and Jackeymo continued to gaze after it from the\r\ngate.\r\n\r\n\"She is gone,\" said Jackeymo, brushing his eyes with his coat-sleeve.\r\n\"But it is a load off one's mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"And another load on one's heart,\" murmured Riccabocca. \"Don't cry,\r\nJemima; it may be bad for you, and bad for _him_ that is to come. It is\r\nastonishing how the humors of the mother may affect the unborn. I should\r\nnot like to have a son who has a more than usual propensity to tears.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor philosopher tried to smile; but it was a bad attempt. He went\r\nslowly in and shut himself up with his books. But he could not read. His\r\nwhole mind was unsettled. And though, like all parents, he had been\r\nanxious to rid himself of a beloved daughter for life, now that she was\r\ngone but for a while, a string seemed broken in the Music of Home.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nThe evening of the same day, as Egerton, who was to entertain a large\r\nparty at dinner, was changing his dress, Harley walked into his room.\r\n\r\nEgerton dismissed his valet by a sign, and continued his toilet.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, my dear Harley, I have only ten minutes to give you. I\r\nexpect one of the royal dukes, and punctuality is the stern virtue of\r\nmen of business, and the graceful courtesy of princes.\"\r\n\r\nHarley had usually a jest for his friend's aphorisms; but he had none\r\nnow. He laid his hand kindly on Egerton's shoulder--\"Before I speak of\r\nmy business, tell me how you are--better?\"\r\n\r\n\"Better--nay, I am always well. Pooh! I may look a little tired--years\r\nof toil will tell on the countenance. But that matters little--the\r\nperiod of life has passed with me when one cares how one looks in the\r\nglass.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, Egerton completed his dress, and came to the hearth,\r\nstanding there, erect and dignified as usual, still far handsomer than\r\nmany a younger man, and with a form that seemed to have ample vigor to\r\nsupport for many a year the sad and glorious burden of power.\r\n\r\n\"So now to your business, Harley.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, I want you to present me, at the first opportunity,\r\nto Madame di Negra. You say she wished to know me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you serious?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, she receives this evening. I did not mean to go; but when\r\nmy party breaks up\"--\r\n\r\n\"You can call for me at 'The Travellers.' Do!\r\n\r\n\"Next--you knew Lady Jane Horton better even than I did, at least in the\r\nlast year of her life.\" Harley sighed, and Egerton turned and stirred\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\n\"Pray, did you ever see at her house, or hear her speak of, a Mrs.\r\nBertram?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of whom?\" said Egerton, in a hollow voice, his face still turned\r\ntowards the fire.\r\n\r\n\"A Mrs. Bertram; but heavens! my dear fellow, what is the matter? Are\r\nyou ill?\"\r\n\r\n\"A spasm at the heart--that is all--don't ring--I shall be better\r\npresently--go on talking. Mrs.---- why do you ask?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why! I have hardly time to explain; but I am, as I told you, resolved\r\non righting my old Italian friend, if Heaven will help me, as it ever\r\ndoes help the just when they bestir themselves; and this Mrs. Bertram is\r\nmixed up in my friend's affairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"His! How is that possible?\"\r\n\r\nHarley rapidly and succinctly explained. Audley listened attentively,\r\nwith his eyes fixed on the floor, and still seeming to labor under great\r\ndifficulty of breathing.\r\n\r\nAt last he answered, \"I remember something of this Mrs.--Mrs.--Bertram.\r\nBut your inquiries after her would be useless. I think I have heard that\r\nshe is long since dead; nay, I am sure of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dead!--that is most unfortunate. But do you know any of her relations\r\nor friends? Can you suggest any mode of tracing this packet if it came\r\nto her hands?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Lady Jane had scarcely any friend that I remember, except my\r\nmother, and she knows nothing of this Mrs. Bertram. How unlucky! I think\r\nI shall advertise. Yet, no. I could only distinguish this Mrs. Bertram\r\nfrom any other of the same name, by stating with whom she had gone\r\nabroad, and that would catch the attention of Peschiera, and set him to\r\ncounterwork us.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what avails it?\" said Egerton. \"She whom you seek is no more--no\r\nmore!\" He paused, and went on rapidly--\"The packet did not arrive in\r\nEngland till years after her death--was no doubt returned to the\r\npost-office--is destroyed long ago.\"\r\n\r\nHarley looked very much disappointed. Egerton went on in a sort of set\r\nmechanical voice, as if not thinking of what he said, but speaking from\r\nthe dry practical mode of reasoning which was habitual to him, and by\r\nwhich the man of the world destroys the hopes of an enthusiast. Then\r\nstarting up at the sound of the first thundering knock at the street\r\ndoor, he said, \"Hark! you must excuse me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I leave you, my dear Audley. Are you better now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Much, much--quite well. I will call for you, probably between eleven\r\nand twelve.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nIf any one could be more surprised at seeing Lord L'Estrange at the\r\nhouse of Madame di Negra that evening than the fair hostess herself, it\r\nwas Randal Leslie. Something instinctively told him that this visit\r\nthreatened interference with whatever might be his ultimate projects in\r\nregard to Riccabocca and Violante. But Randal Leslie was not one of\r\nthose who shrink from an intellectual combat. On the contrary, he was\r\ntoo confident of his powers of intrigue, not to take a delight in their\r\nexercise. He could not conceive that the indolent Harley could be a\r\nmatch for his own restless activity and dogged perseverance. But in a\r\nvery few moments fear crept on him. No man of his day could produce a\r\nmore brilliant effect than Lord L'Estrange, when he deigned to desire\r\nit. Without much pretence to that personal beauty which strikes at first\r\nsight, he still retained all the charm of countenance, and all the grace\r\nof manner which had made him in boyhood the spoiled darling of society.\r\nMadame di Negra had collected but a small circle round her, still it was\r\nof the _elite_ of the great world; not, indeed, those more precise and\r\nreserved _dames du chateau_, whom the lighter and easier of the fair\r\ndispensers of fashion ridicule as prudes; but, nevertheless, ladies were\r\nthere, as unblemished in reputation as high in rank; flirts and\r\ncoquettes, perhaps--nothing more; in short, \"charming women\"--the gay\r\nbutterflies that hover over the stiff parterre. And there were\r\nambassadors and ministers, and wits and brilliant debaters, and\r\nfirst-rate dandies (dandies, when first-rate, are generally very\r\nagreeable men). Amongst all these various persons, Harley, so long a\r\nstranger to the London world, seemed to make himself at home with the\r\nease of an Alcibiades. Many of the less juvenile ladies remembered him,\r\nand rushed to claim his acquaintance, with nods, and becks, and wreathed\r\nsmiles. He had ready compliments for each. And few indeed were there,\r\nmen or women, for whom Harley L'Estrange had not appropriate attraction.\r\nDistinguished reputation as a soldier and scholar, for the grave; whim\r\nand pleasantry for the gay; novelty for the sated; and for the more\r\nvulgar natures, was he not Lord L'Estrange, unmarried, heir to an\r\nancient earldom, and some fifty thousand a-year?\r\n\r\nNot till he had succeeded in the general effect--which, it must be\r\nowned, he did his best to create--did Harley seriously and especially\r\ndevote himself to his hostess. And then he seated himself by her side;\r\nand as if in compliment to both, less pressing admirers insensibly\r\nslipped away and edged off.\r\n\r\nFrank Hazeldean was the last to quit his ground behind Madame di Negra's\r\nchair; but when he found that the two began to talk in Italian, and he\r\ncould not understand a word they said, he too--fancying, poor fellow,\r\nthat he looked foolish, and cursing his Eaton education that had\r\nneglected, for languages spoken by the dead, of which he had learned\r\nlittle, those still in use among the living, of which he had learned\r\nnaught--retreated towards Randal, and asked wistfully, \"Pray, what age\r\nshould you say L'Estrange was? He must be devilish old, in spite of his\r\nlooks. Why, he was at Waterloo!\"\r\n\r\n\"He is young enough to be a terrible rival,\" answered Randal, with\r\nartful truth.\r\n\r\nFrank turned pale, and began to meditate dreadful bloodthirsty thoughts,\r\nof which hair-triggers and Lord's Cricket-ground formed the staple.\r\n\r\nCertainly there was apparent ground for a lover's jealousy. For Harley\r\nand Beatrice now conversed in a low tone, and Beatrice seemed agitated,\r\nand Harley earnest. Randal himself grew more and more perplexed. Was\r\nLord L'Estrange really enamored of the Marchesa? If so, farewell to all\r\nhopes of Frank's marriage with her! Or was he merely playing a part in\r\nRiccabocca's interest; pretending to be the lover, in order to obtain an\r\ninfluence over her mind, rule her through her ambition, and secure an\r\nally against her brother? Was this _finesse_ compatible with Randal's\r\nnotions of Harley's character? Was it consistent with that chivalric and\r\nsoldierly spirit of honor which the frank nobleman affected, to make\r\nlove to a woman in a mere _ruse de guerre_? Could mere friendship for\r\nRiccabocca be a sufficient inducement to a man, who, whatever his\r\nweaknesses or his errors, seemed to wear on his very forehead a soul\r\nabove deceit, to stoop to paltry means, even for a worthy end? At this\r\nquestion, a new thought flashed upon Randal--might not Lord L'Estrange\r\nhave speculated himself upon winning Violante?--would not that account\r\nfor all the exertions he had made on behalf of her inheritance at the\r\ncourt of Vienna--exertions of which Peschiera and Beatrice had both\r\ncomplained? Those objections which the Austrian government might take to\r\nViolante's marriage with some obscure Englishman would probably not\r\nexist against a man like Harley L'Estrange, whose family not only\r\nbelonged to the highest aristocracy of England, but had always supported\r\nopinions in vogue amongst the leading governments of Europe. Harley\r\nhimself, it is true, had never taken part in politics, but his notions\r\nwere, no doubt, those of a high-born soldier, who had fought, in\r\nalliance with Austria, for the restoration of the Bourbons. And this\r\nimmense wealth--which Violante might lose if she married one like Randal\r\nhimself--her marriage with the heir of the Lansmeres might actually tend\r\nonly to secure. Could Harley, with all his own expectations, be\r\nindifferent to such a prize?--and no doubt he had learned Violante's\r\nrare beauty in his correspondence with Riccabocca.\r\n\r\nThus considered, it seemed natural to Randal's estimate of human nature,\r\nthat Harley's more prudish scruples of honor, as regards what is due to\r\nwomen, could not resist a temptation so strong. Mere friendship was not\r\na motive powerful enough to shake them, but ambition was.\r\n\r\nWhile Randal was thus cogitating, Frank thus suffering, and many a\r\nwhisper, in comment on the evident flirtation between the beautiful\r\nhostess and the accomplished guest, reached the ears both of the\r\nbrooding schemer and the jealous lover, the conversation between the two\r\nobjects of remark and gossip had taken a new turn. Indeed, Beatrice had\r\nmade an effort to change it.\r\n\r\n\"It is long, my lord,\" said she, still speaking Italian, \"since I have\r\nheard sentiments like those you address to me; and if I do not feel\r\nmyself wholly unworthy of them, it is from the pleasure I have felt in\r\nreading sentiments equally foreign to the language of the world in which\r\nI live.\" She took a book from the table as she spoke: \"Have you seen\r\nthis work?\"\r\n\r\nHarley glanced at the title-page. \"To be sure I have, and I know the\r\nauthor.\"\r\n\r\n\"I envy you that honor. I should so like also to know one who has\r\ndiscovered to me deeps in my own heart which I had never explored.\"\r\n\r\n\"Charming Marchesa, if the book has done this, believe me that I have\r\npaid you no false compliment--formed no overflattering estimate of your\r\nnature; for the charm of the work is but in its simple appeal to good\r\nand generous emotions, and it can charm none in whom those emotions\r\nexist not!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, that cannot be true, or why is it so popular?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because good and generous emotions are more common to the human heart\r\nthan we are aware of till the appeal comes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't ask me to think that! I have found the world so base.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me a rude question; but what do you know of the world?\"\r\n\r\nBeatrice looked first in surprise at Harley, then glanced round the room\r\nwith significant irony.\r\n\r\n\"As I thought; you call this little room 'the world.' Be it so. I will\r\nventure to say, that if the people in this room were suddenly converted\r\ninto an audience before a stage, and you were as consummate in the\r\nactor's art as you are in all others that please and command--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"And were to deliver a speech full of sordid and base sentiments, you\r\nwould be hissed. But let any other woman, with half your powers, arise\r\nand utter sentiments sweet and womanly, or honest and lofty--and\r\napplause would flow from every lip, and tears rush to many a worldly\r\neye. The true proof of the inherent nobleness of our common nature is in\r\nthe sympathy it betrays with what is noble wherever crowds are\r\ncollected. Never believe the world is base;--if it were so, no society\r\ncould hold together for a day. But you would know the author of this\r\nbook? I will bring him to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said Harley rising, and with his candid winning smile, \"do\r\nyou think we shall ever be friends?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have startled me so, that I can scarcely answer. But why would you\r\nbe friends with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you need a friend. You have none?\"\r\n\r\n\"Strange flatterer!\" said Beatrice, smiling, though very sadly; and\r\nlooking up, her eye caught Randal's.\r\n\r\n\"Pooh!\" said Harley, \"you are too penetrating to believe that you\r\ninspire friendship _there_. Ah, do you suppose that, all the while I\r\nhave been conversing with you, I have not noticed the watchful gaze of\r\nMr. Randal Leslie? What tie can possibly connect you together I know not\r\nyet; but I soon shall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed! you talk like one of the old Council of Venice. You try hard to\r\nmake me fear you,\" said Beatrice, seeking to escape from the graver kind\r\nof impression Harley had made on her, by the affectation, partly of\r\ncoquetry, partly of levity.\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" said L'Estrange, calmly, \"tell you already, that I fear you no\r\nmore.\" He bowed, and passed through the crowd to rejoin Audley, who was\r\nseated in a corner, whispering with some of his political colleagues.\r\nBefore Harley reached the minister, he found himself close to Randal and\r\nyoung Hazeldean.\r\n\r\nHe bowed to the first, and extended his hand to the last. Randal felt\r\nthe distinction, and his sullen, bitter pride was deeply galled--a\r\nfeeling of hate towards Harley passed into his mind. He was pleased to\r\nsee the cold hesitation with which Frank just touched the hand offered\r\nto him. But Randal had not been the only person whose watch upon\r\nBeatrice the keen-eyed Harley had noticed. Harley had seen the angry\r\nlooks of Frank Hazeldean, and divined the cause. So he smiled\r\nforgivingly at the slight he had received.\r\n\r\n\"You are like me, Mr. Hazeldean,\" said he. \"You think something of the\r\nheart should go with all courtesy that bespeaks friendship--\r\n\r\n    \"The hand of Douglas is his own.\"\r\n\r\nHere Harley drew aside Randal. \"Mr. Leslie, a word with you. If I wished\r\nto know the retreat of Dr. Riccabocca, in order to render him a great\r\nservice, would you confide to me that secret?\"\r\n\r\n\"That woman has let out her suspicions that I know the exile's retreat,\"\r\nthought Randal; and with rare presence of mind, he replied at once--\r\n\r\n\"My Lord, yonder stands a connection of Dr. Riccabocca's. Mr. Hazeldean\r\nis surely the person to whom you should address this inquiry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so, Mr. Leslie; for I suspect that he cannot answer it, and that\r\nyou can. Well, I will ask something that it seems to me you may grant\r\nwithout hesitation. Should you see Dr. Riccabocca, tell him that I am in\r\nEngland, and so leave it to him to communicate with me or not; but\r\nperhaps you have already done so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord L'Estrange,\" said Randal, bowing low, with pointed formality,\r\n\"excuse me if I decline either to disclaim or acquiesce in the knowledge\r\nyou impute to me. If I am acquainted with any secret intrusted to me by\r\nDr. Riccabocca, it is for me to use my own discretion how best to guard\r\nit. And for the rest, after the Scotch earl, whose words your lordship\r\nhas quoted, refused to touch the hand of Marmion, Douglas could scarcely\r\nhave called him back in order to give him--a message!\"\r\n\r\nHarley was not prepared for this tone in Mr. Egerton's _protege_, and\r\nhis own gallant nature was rather pleased than irritated by a\r\nhaughtiness that at least seemed to bespeak independence of spirit.\r\nNevertheless, L'Estrange's suspicions of Randal were too strong to be\r\neasily set aside, and therefore he replied, civilly, but with covert\r\ntaunt--\r\n\r\n\"I submit to your rebuke, Mr. Leslie, though I meant not the offence you\r\nwould ascribe to me. I regret my unlucky quotation yet the more, since\r\nthe wit of your retort has obliged you to identify yourself with\r\nMarmion, who, though a clever and brave fellow, was an\r\nuncommonly--tricky one.\" And so Harley, certainly having the best of it,\r\nmoved on, and joining Egerton, in a few minutes more both left the room.\r\n\r\n\"What was L'Estrange saying to you?\" asked Frank. \"Something about\r\nBeatrice, I am sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; only quoting poetry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, what made you look so angry, my dear fellow? I know it was your\r\nkind feeling for me. As you say, he is a formidable rival. But that\r\ncan't be his own hair. Do you think he wears a _toupet_? I am sure he\r\nwas praising Beatrice. He is evidently very much smitten with her. But I\r\ndon't think she is a woman to be caught by _mere_ rank and fortune! Do\r\nyou? Why can't you speak?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you do not get her consent soon, I think she is lost to you,\" said\r\nRandal slowly; and, before Frank could recover his dismay, glided from\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nViolante's first evening at the Lansmeres, had seemed happier to her\r\nthan the first evening, under the same roof, had done to Helen. True\r\nthat she missed her father much--Jemima somewhat; but she so identified\r\nher father's cause with Harley, that she had a sort of vague feeling\r\nthat it was to promote that cause that she was on this visit to Harley's\r\nparents. And the Countess, it must be owned, was more emphatically\r\ncordial to her than she had ever yet been to Captain Digby's orphan. But\r\nperhaps the real difference in the heart of either girl was this, that\r\nHelen felt awe of Lady Lansmere, and Violante felt only love for Lord\r\nL'Estrange's mother. Violante, too, was one of those persons whom a\r\nreserved and formal person, like the Countess, \"can get on with,\" as the\r\nphrase goes. Not so poor little Helen--so shy herself, and so hard to\r\ncoax into more than gentle monosyllables. And Lady Lansmere's favorite\r\ntalk was always of Harley. Helen had listened to such talk with respect\r\nand interest. Violante listened to it with inquisitive eagerness--with\r\nblushing delight. The mother's heart noticed the distinction between the\r\ntwo, and no wonder that the heart moved more to Violante than to Helen.\r\nLord Lansmere, too, like most gentlemen of his age, clumped all young\r\nladies together, as a harmless, amiable, but singularly stupid class of\r\nthe genus-Petticoat, meant to look pretty, play the piano, and talk to\r\neach other about frocks and sweethearts. Therefore this animated,\r\ndazzling creature, with her infinite variety of look and play of mind,\r\ntook him by surprise, charmed him into attention, and warmed him into\r\ngallantry. Helen sat in her quiet corner, at her work, sometimes\r\nlistening with mournful, though certainly unenvious, admiration at\r\nViolante's vivid, yet ever unconscious, eloquence of word and\r\nthought--sometimes plunged deep into her own secret meditations. And all\r\nthe while the work went on the same, under the small noiseless fingers.\r\nThis was one of Helen's habits that irritated the nerves of Lady\r\nLansmere. She despised young ladies who were fond of work. She did not\r\ncomprehend how often it is the resource of the sweet womanly mind, not\r\nfrom want of thought, but from the silence and the depth of it. Violante\r\nwas surprised, and perhaps disappointed, that Harley had left the house\r\nbefore dinner, and did not return all the evening. But Lady Lansmere, in\r\nmaking excuse for his absence, on the plea of engagements, found so good\r\nan opportunity to talk of his ways in general--of his rare promise in\r\nboyhood--of her regret at the inaction of his maturity--of her hope to\r\nsee him yet do justice to his natural powers, that Violante almost\r\nceased to miss him.\r\n\r\nAnd when Lady Lansmere conducted her to her room, and kissing her cheek\r\ntenderly, said, \"But you are just the person Harley admires--just the\r\nperson to rouse him from melancholy dreams, of which his wild humors are\r\nnow but the vain disguise\"--Violante crossed her arms on her bosom, and\r\nher bright eyes, deepened into tenderness, seemed to ask, \"He\r\nmelancholy--and why?\"\r\n\r\nOn leaving Violante's room, Lady Lansmere paused before the door of\r\nHelen's; and, after musing a little while, entered softly.\r\n\r\nHelen had dismissed her maid; and, at the moment Lady Lansmere entered,\r\nshe was kneeling at the foot of the bed, her hands clasped before her\r\nface.\r\n\r\nHer form, thus seen, looked so youthful and childlike--the attitude\r\nitself was so holy and so touching, that the proud and cold expression\r\non Lady Lansmere's face changed. She shaded the light involuntarily, and\r\nseated herself in silence, that she might not disturb the act of prayer.\r\n\r\nWhen Helen rose, she was startled to see the Countess seated by the\r\nfire; and hastily drew her hand across her eyes. She had been weeping.\r\n\r\nLady Lansmere did not, however, turn to observe those traces of tears,\r\nwhich Helen feared were too visible. The Countess was too absorbed in\r\nher own thoughts; and as Helen timidly approached, she said--still with\r\nher eyes on the clear low fire--\"I beg your pardon, Miss Digby, for my\r\nintrusion; but my son has left it to me to prepare Lord Lansmere to\r\nlearn the offer you have done Harley the honor to accept. I have not yet\r\nspoken to my lord; it may be days before I find a fitting occasion to do\r\nso; meanwhile, I feel assured that your sense of propriety will make you\r\nagree with me, that it is due to Lord L'Estrange's father, that\r\nstrangers should not learn arrangements of such moment in his family,\r\nbefore his own consent be obtained.\"\r\n\r\nHere the Countess came to a full pause; and poor Helen, finding herself\r\ncalled upon for some reply to this chilling speech, stammered out,\r\nscarce audibly--\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, madam, I never dreamed of--\"\r\n\r\n\"That is right, my dear,\" interrupted Lady Lansmere, rising suddenly,\r\nand as if greatly relieved. \"I could not doubt your superiority to\r\nordinary girls of your age, with whom these matters are never secret for\r\na moment. Therefore, of course, you will not mention, at present, what\r\nhas passed between you and Harley, to any of the friends with whom you\r\nmay correspond.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no correspondents--no friends, Lady Lansmere,\" said Helen,\r\ndeprecatingly, and trying hard not to cry.\r\n\r\n\"I am very glad to hear it, my dear; young ladies never should have.\r\nFriends, especially friends who correspond, are the worst enemies they\r\ncan have. Good night, Miss Digby. I need not add, by the way, that,\r\nthough we are bound to show all kindness to this young Italian lady,\r\nstill she is wholly unconnected with our family; and you will be as\r\nprudent with her as you would have been with your correspondents--had\r\nyou had the misfortune to have any.\"\r\n\r\nLady Lansmere said the last words with a smile, and pressed a reluctant\r\nkiss (the step-mother's kiss) on Helen's bended brow. She then left the\r\nroom, and Helen sat on the seat vacated by the stately unloving form,\r\nand again covered her face with her hands, and again wept. But when she\r\nrose at last, and the light fell upon her face, that soft face was sad\r\nindeed, but serene--serene, as if with some inward sense of duty--sad,\r\nas with the resignation which accepts patience instead of hope.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[21] Continued from page 411.\r\n\r\n[22] Translation of _Charron on Wisdom_. By G. Stanhope, D.D., late Dean\r\nof Canterbury (1729). A translation remarkable for ease, vigor, and\r\n(despite that contempt for the strict rules of grammar, which was common\r\nenough amongst writers at the commencement of the last century) for the\r\nidiomatic raciness of its English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Household Words.\r\n\r\nCHOICE SECRETS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Light a room with spermaceti, anoint your face with the same substance,\r\nand you will seem to all beholders to have the head of a sperm whale\r\nupon your shoulders.\" \"When you would have men in the house seem to be\r\nwithout heads: take yellow brimstone with oil, and put it in a lamp and\r\nlight it, and set it in the midst amongst men, and you shall see a\r\nwonder.\" These are two out of a large mass of facts which form a compact\r\nbody of ancestral wisdom. They lie before us in a venerable volume,\r\nwhose grave frontispiece is adorned with the portraitures of Alexis,\r\nAlbertus Magnus, Dr. Reade, Raymond Lully, Dr. Harvey, Lord Bacon, and\r\nDr. John Wecker. John Wecker, Doctor in Physic, first compiled the book,\r\nand Dr. R. Read augmented and enlarged it. \"A like work never before was\r\nin the English tongue.\" It was printed in the year 1661, for Simon\r\nMiller, at the Starre in St. Paul's Church Yard, and it is entitled,\r\n\"Eighteen Books of the Secrets of Art and Nature, being the Summe and\r\nSubstance of Naturall Philosophy, Methodically Digested.\" The book is\r\none of considerable size and pretension, written by wise doctors in the\r\ngood old time, two hundred years ago. Let us not be conceited and harp\r\nonly on the strings provided to our fingers in the nineteenth century.\r\nFor a few minutes, at least, it will not do us harm to get a little\r\nscientific information from our ancestors. We shall glean, therefore,\r\nsome random facts out of the harvest-field of Doctors Mead and Wecker,\r\nselecting, of course, most characteristic, those which our forefathers\r\nmay call exclusively their own.\r\n\r\nThe volume opens with scientific information on the subject of Angels\r\nand Devils, including, of course, the fact that \"Witches kill children,\r\nand divers cattle, which we find by various experience, and by relation\r\nof others that are worthy to be believed. But if you will say they are\r\nmere delusions of the Devil, whereby he makes foolish women mad that are\r\nentangled by him, that they believe they do those things which neither\r\nthey nor the devil can do; if we can so avoid it, we may as well deny\r\nany thing else, be it never so evident. \"--If you deny that, you may\r\ndeny any thing--is a phrase not yet dead. Applied two hundred years ago\r\nto the experience concerning witches, it has been industriously employed\r\nto the present day, and is employed still on behalf of a great many\r\nfresh delusions. As for the gentleman, whom truth is said to shame, he\r\nclaimed his distinct chapter in the minds of old physicians, because, as\r\nthe book before us has it, he \"can cause many diseases, of the reasons\r\nwhereof we are ignorant. Also he can do this, or that; being subtile, he\r\ncan easily pass through all parts of the body, which he can bind, pull\r\nback, or torment otherwise.\"\r\n\r\nPassing on now, as we follow the march of high philosophy, to secrets of\r\nthe sun and moon; it may be worth while to understand, as our\r\nforefathers taught, that \"it is easie to guess at the fortune of every\r\nyear by the stars, if a man consider twelve, nineteen, eight, four, and\r\nthirty.\" Somebody wants to know what luck he will have in 1853. Let him\r\nconsider 1841 (twelve years back), let him consider 1834 (nineteen years\r\nback), and, for the eight, four, thirty, let him look back to the years\r\n1845, 1849, and 1823. Let him reflect on the nature of his fortune in\r\neach of those years, look up his old diaries, combine their results, and\r\nthat will give him the character of his fate in 1853. Jupiter is somehow\r\nat the bottom of this, but we are too modern and ignorant to understand\r\nthe author's explanation.\r\n\r\nAmong secrets concerning fire, are those two facts connected with\r\nspermaceti and brimstone already stated. Any one living in the country,\r\nwhom the croaking of the frogs may trouble of a night, will doubtless\r\nbe glad to hear of a remedy: \"Take the fat of a crocodile, and make it\r\nup with wax while in the sun, and make a candle of it, and light it in\r\nthe place where frogs are, and when they see that they will presently\r\ncease crying.\" Where crocodile's fat cannot be had, \"the fat of a\r\ndolphin\" will do. Prescriptions abound, by the use of which men may\r\nappear to wear the heads of asses, horses, dogs, or to resemble\r\nelephants. There is a receipt also for making \"a faire light, that the\r\nhouse may seem all full of serpents so long as the wick doth burn.\" But\r\nwe pass over these pleasant methods of illumination, simply remarking,\r\nthat if our wise ancestors were right, the volume now before us would\r\nprocure a sudden fortune to the lessees of Vauxhall. By the use of some\r\ndozen kinds of cunningly prepared lamps, the Royal Gardens might in good\r\nfaith be chronicled in its bills as a \"scene of enchantment.\" At one\r\nturn of a walk, all visitors would show their heads, and at another,\r\nnone; in another grove they would be elephants, and in another they\r\nwould look like angels. The Rotunda might be lighted for a diabolical\r\neffect, and the Dark Walk illuminated brilliantly with dolphin's fat,\r\nfuneral cloth and Azemat, whose light makes every body invisible. This,\r\nagain, is no bad hint for a country tallow-chandler, who supplies light\r\nto the ladies of a solemn village, where he is annoyed by the neglect of\r\nany gayeties that would create large orders for composite or sperm: \"_To\r\nmake women rejoice mightily._ Make candles of the fat of hares, and\r\nlight them, and let them stand awhile in the middle where women are:\r\nthey will not be so merry as to dance; yet sometimes that falls out\r\nalso.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a wonder that some report how that the tooth of a badger, or his\r\nleft foot bound to a man's right arm will strengthen the memory.\" Boys,\r\nwho have lessons to learn, may like to know that fact; and teachers, who\r\nhave idle pupils, must not flog, but feed them upon cresses. \"Cresses\r\neaten make a man industrious.\" Young ladies, who believe in their\r\nancestors, will thank us for repeating their opinion that the use of a\r\nring, which was lain for a certain time in a sparrow's nest, will\r\nprocure love. Nor need any dread the penalties of matrimony, since the\r\nman who carries with him a hartshorn \"shall alwaies have peace with his\r\nwife:\" and also, \"the heart of a male quail, carried by the man, and the\r\nheart of a female quail, by the woman, will cause that no quarrels can\r\never arise between them.\" The man who carries a quail's heart in his\r\npocket may face his wife, and never have to feel his own heart quailing\r\nunderneath his ribs.\r\n\r\nOld Parr dined probably upon serpents, not, as is commonly reported,\r\nupon pills. \"It is known that stags renew their age by eating serpents;\r\nso the phoenix is restored by the nest of spices shee makes to burn\r\nin. The pelican hath the same virtue, whose right foot, if it be put\r\nunder hot dung, after three months a pelican will be bred from it.\r\nWherefore some physicians, with some confections, made of a viper and\r\nhellebore, and of some of the flesh of these creatures, do promise to\r\nrestore youth, and sometimes they do it.\" If the Zoological Society has\r\nproper respect for our ancestors, they will not delay to sow a hot-bed\r\nwith pelicans' feet. Young shoots of pelican would be much more\r\nappropriate beside the gravel-walks than your mere vegetable\r\npelargonium.\r\n\r\nIn the way of practice of medicine, we moderns say that any thing like\r\nscientific principles, on which one can depend, have only been attained\r\nin our own lifetime. \"Doctors differed,\" and bumped against each other,\r\nonly because all alike were feeling through the dark. In our own day\r\nthere is light enough to keep doctors from differing very\r\ngrossly,--gross difference springing generally more from the want of\r\nknowledge in an individual, than in the profession generally. Although\r\nthere is yet a vast deal to be learned. In the first century,\r\nAsclepiades dubbed the medical system of Hippocrates, \"a cold meditation\r\nof death.\" Under Nero there arose a Dr. Thessalus, who taught that\r\nNature was the guide to follow and obey in all diseases; and, therefore,\r\nunder his system patients were simply to be liberally and rapidly\r\nsupplied with every thing they fancied. Paracelsus, in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, looked for a patient's symptoms in the stars; so we must not be\r\nsurprised if the \"Secrets in Physic and Surgery,\" published among the\r\nother secrets in this volume now before us, contain odd information.\r\nHere is a nice cure for a quartan ague, which might tickle a patient's\r\nstomach sooner than his fancy: \"Seven wig-lice of the bed, wrapped in a\r\ngreat grape husk, and swallowed down alive before the fit.\" Another cure\r\nis effected when the patient eats the parings of his nails and toes,\r\nmingled with wax. There are many remedies against the Plague; but that\r\none which is recommended as \"_The Best Thing against the Plague_,\" is\r\nfor a man to wash his mouth with vinegar and water before he goes out,\r\ndrinking also a spoonful of the liquor; then to press his nose and stop\r\nhis breath, so that \"by the vapor and steam held in your mouth, the\r\nbrain be moistened.\" In the following prescription we believe entirely:\r\n\"_For Melancholy._ It is no small remedy to cure melancholy, to rub your\r\nbody all over with nettles.\"\r\n\r\nBook Five contains secrets for beautifying the human body. The following\r\nreceipt, which comes first, for giving people a substantial look, seems\r\nto be somewhat too efficacious to be often tried: \"_To make men fat._ If\r\nyou mingle with the fat of a lizard, salt-petre and cummin and\r\nwheat-meal, hens fatted with this meat will be so fat, that men that eat\r\nof them, will eat until they burst.\" A degree of fatness in hens equal\r\nto this will never be communicated by our degenerate modern\r\nagriculturists. For the hair-dyes, favored by our forefathers, we\r\ncannot, however, say much, for we must differ in taste very decidedly.\r\nRecipes are given for obtaining, not only black, but white hair, yellow\r\nhair, red hair, and \"To make your hair seem GREEN.\" Nobody in these days\r\nwill use a course of the distilled water of capers to make his hair look\r\nlike a meadow; and even, if any body among us, too fastidious as we now\r\nare, wanted yellow hair, we do _not_ think that he would consent to rub\r\ninto his head for that purpose honey and the yolk of eggs. There are\r\nalso in this part of the work some ungallant recommendations of\r\nsubstances, which a man may chew in order that, presently breathing near\r\na lady's cheek, he may discolor it, and so detect her artifice, if she\r\nshould happen to be painted. Among \"secrets for beautifying the body,\"\r\nwe cannot but think this also indicative of an odd taste; \"If you would\r\nchange the color of children's eyes, you shall do it thus; with the\r\nashes of the small nut-shells, with oil you must anoint the forepart of\r\ntheir head; _it will make the whites of children's eyes black_; DO IT\r\nOFTEN!\"\r\n\r\nConcerning wine, it is worth knowing, that to cure a man of drunkenness,\r\nyou should put eels into his wine. Delightful dreams will visit the\r\ncouch of him who has eaten moderately, for supper, of a horse's tongue,\r\nand taken balm for salad. This is \"A means to make a man sleep sweetly,\"\r\nwhich we recommend to the attention of all restless people, who have\r\nproper faith in their forefathers. As we have passed over a good many\r\npages, and come to the \"secrets of asses,\" we may put down, _a propos_\r\nto nothing, that \"If an ass have a stone bound to his tail he cannot\r\nbray.\"\r\n\r\nThe following may be tried in a few months by ladies in the country, who\r\nrise early on a fine spring morning; they may thus earn the delight of\r\nexhibiting to their friends one of the prettiest balloon ascents that\r\nany body can conceive: \"In May, fill an egg-shell with May-dew, and set\r\nit in the hot sun at noon-day, and the sun will draw it up.\"\r\n\r\nThe secrets of gardening, known to our forefathers, annihilate all claim\r\nin Sir Joseph Paxton to the commonest consideration. They taught how to\r\nget the blue roses by manuring with indigo, or green roses by digging\r\nverdigris about the roots. They taught the whole art of perfuming fruit,\r\nby steeping the seeds of the future tree in oil of spike, or rose-water\r\nand musk. If, say our ancestors, you would have peaches, plums, or\r\ncherries without any stone, you have only, when the tree is a twig, to\r\npick out all the pith before you set it. To get your filbert-trees to\r\nbear you fruit all kernel, you have only to crack a nut, and sow the\r\nkernel only, covered with a little wool. And very much more marvellous,\r\nin the annals of gardening, is the receipt for getting peach-trees that\r\nbear fruit covered with inscriptions: \"When you have eaten the peach,\r\nsteep the stone two or three days in water, and open it gently, and\r\n_take the kernal out of it(!)_ and write something within the shell with\r\nan iron graver, what you please, yet not too deep, then wrap it in paper\r\nand set it; whatever you write in the shell you shall find written in\r\nthe fruit.\" Such shrewd things mingled with the more ordinary knowledge\r\nof our ancestors upon affairs of gardening.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that for many of these \"facts\" there was a \"reason\"\r\nclose at hand. Our forefathers were wise enough to know that every thing\r\nrequired properly accounting for. Thus, for example, in \"the secrets of\r\nmetals:\" \"Some report that a candle lighted of man's fat, and brought to\r\nthe place where the treasures are hid, will discover them with the\r\nnoise; and when it is near them it will go out. If this be true, it\r\nariseth from sympathy; for fat is made of blood, and blood is the seat\r\nof the soul and spirits, and both these are held by the desire of silver\r\nand gold, so long as a man lives; and therefore they trouble the blood;\r\nso here is sympathy.\"\r\n\r\nIf a man would prevent hail from coming down, he is to walk about his\r\ngarden, with a crocodile--stuffed, of course--and hang it up in the\r\nmiddle. Pieces of the skin of a hippopotamus, wherever they are buried,\r\nkeep off storms. A thunder-storm also can be put to rout by firing\r\ncannons at it; \"for by the force of the sound moving the air, the\r\nexhalations are driven upward.\" (In the same way, the plague was said to\r\nyield before a cannonade.) \"Some who observe hail coming on, bring a\r\nhuge looking-glass, and observe the largeness of the cloud, and by that\r\nremedy,--whether objected against, or despised by it, or it is\r\ndispleased with it; or whether, being doubled, it gives way to the\r\nother\" (in some way or other one must find out a reason), \"they suddenly\r\nturn it off and remove it.\" An owl stuck up in the fields, with its\r\nwings spread, served also as a scare-crow to the tempests. As lightning\r\nconductor on a roof, it was thought wise to put an egg-shell, out of\r\nwhich a chicken had been hatched on Ascension-day. Thunderbolt stones\r\nwere said to sweat during a storm, which was not thought a more\r\nwonderful \"fact\" than the perspirations streaming out of glass windows\r\n\"in winter when the stove is hot.\" Our ancestors were far too wise to be\r\nsurprised at any thing.\r\n\r\nSecrets of alchemy, magic, and astrology are, of course, very profound;\r\nwe pass over these and many more; among secrets of cookery we pause,\r\nshuddering. Whipping young pigs to death, to make them tender eating,\r\nused to be quite bad enough; and some of our own hidden devices in the\r\nmeat trade are, even now, equally revolting; but here we meet with a\r\ndevice of the wise ancestors, which may, perhaps, stand at the head of\r\nall culinary horrors. Remembering that these cooks were also apt at\r\nroasting men, we will inflict this illustration on our readers: \"_To\r\nroast a Goose alive._ Let it be a duck or goose, or some such lively\r\ncreature; but a goose is best of all for this purpose; leaving his neck,\r\npull off all the feathers from his body, then make a fire round about\r\nhim, not too wide, for that will not roast him; within the place set\r\nhere and there small pots full of water, with salt and honey mixed\r\ntherewith, and let there be dishes set full of roasted apples, and cut\r\nin pieces in the dish, and let the goose be basted with butter all over,\r\nand larded to make him better meat, and he may roast the better; put\r\nfire to it; do not make too much haste, when he begins to roast, walking\r\nabout, and striving to fly away; the fire stops him in, and he will fall\r\nto drink water to quench his thirst; this will cool his heart, and the\r\nother parts of his body, and, by this medicament, he looseneth his belly\r\nand grows empty. And when he roasteth and consumes inwardly, always wet\r\nhis head and heart with a wet sponge; but when you see him run madding\r\nand stumble, his heart wants moisture, take him away, set him before\r\nyour guests, and he will cry as you cut off any part from him, and will\r\nbe almost eaten up before he be dead; it is very pleasant to behold.\"\r\n\r\nDegenerate moderns would most certainly be unable to enjoy such\r\nhospitality, and would be cured as thoroughly of any appetite as if\r\ntheir host had employed another of the secrets of our ancestors. \"That\r\nguests may not eat at table, do this: You must have a needle that dead\r\npeople are often sewed up in their winding-sheet; and at beginning of\r\nsupper secretly stick this under the table; this will hinder the guests\r\nfrom eating, that they will rather be weary to sit, than desirous to\r\neat; take it away when you have laughed at them awhile.\"\r\n\r\nTake it away, we must say now to the old book. As we have said, our\r\nspecimens, drawn from an immense mass of the same kind, do not represent\r\nthe sole character of the volume. It states, also, a very large number\r\nof facts, confirmed and explained in the present day, being a fair\r\ntranscript of the average standard of opinion among learned doctors upon\r\na great number of things. Have we not made a little progress since those\r\ngood old times, and would it be a pleasant thing to get them back again?\r\nTo come home to every man's breakfast-table, we may ask the public to\r\ndecide between the coffee now made, and the coffee of the good old\r\ntimes. In a somewhat expensive book, addressed only to wealthy readers,\r\nDrs. Read and Weckir disclose this secret of good coffee, for the ladies\r\nand gentlemen of 1660:--\"Take the berry, put it in a tin pudding-pan,\r\nand when bread hath been in the oven about half-an-hour, put in your\r\ncoffee; there let it stand till you draw your bread; then beat it and\r\nsift it; mix it thus: first boyl your water about half-an-hour; to every\r\nquart of water put in a spoonful of the pouder of coffee; then let it\r\nboyl one-third away; clear it off from the setlings; and the next day\r\nput fresh water; and so add every day fresh water, so long as any\r\nsetlings remain. _Often Tryed._\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthors and Books.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTHOR SCHOPENHAUER, of Berlin, has recently published _Parerga und\r\nParalipomena, or little Philosophical Writings_, in which, according to\r\na Leipsic reviewer, \"the author asserts that _his_ philosophy is not\r\nmerely the _only_ advance in that department since the days of Kant, but\r\nthat _his_ system bears the same relation to all earlier philosophy,\r\nthat the New Testament bears to the Old. In addition to this, he\r\nattempts to solve the problem, how can it be possible that he has ever\r\nbeen as unknown to the literary and scientific world as the Man in the\r\nMoon, while the absurdest and most ridiculous theories, such, for\r\nexample, as those of Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, have been so\r\ngenerally accepted. But as he, in spite of the most earnest endeavors,\r\ncan find no internal ground for this unaccountable blindness of the\r\npublic, he seeks it in another direction. These impudent sophists, it\r\nseems, have had no other ground than simply _that of making money_! With\r\nthe hocus-pocus of common charlatans they have carried their wares to\r\nmarket, and as _candidates_ and teachers of philosophy generally spring\r\nup from the same effort, there resulted an alliance of charlatans whose\r\nobject it was on the one side to raise themselves to heaven, and on the\r\nother to suppress all true thinking, so that the public might be\r\nprevented, by a just consideration of their own worthlessness.\" \"Such\r\naccusations as those,\" continues our reviewer, \"awaken an unfavorable\r\nimpression, which is not in the least diminished by continued boasting\r\nand grandiloquence, and a clumsy roughness of style, which not\r\nunfrequently falls into downright burlesque. The work itself is an odd\r\nmixture of actual recollections and arbitrary fancies, of explanations\r\nand superstitions, which force us to regret that many really admirable\r\nthoughts which occasionally surprise the reader in an assembly of\r\ntrivialities and paradoxes, must inevitably be lost. Those philosophers\r\ncertainly provoke sharp criticism when we separate their truly\r\nscientific contents from their visions and dispositions, and it would\r\nperhaps be more in accordance with the spirit of the age to return more\r\nearnestly to _Kant_ than most of the more recent philosophers are\r\naccustomed to do. Still nothing is in the least gained for the negative\r\naim of criticism, when the critic makes it such an easy matter to cast\r\naway, without further consideration, all of the latest advances in\r\nphilosophy, because he believes that he has detected errors in their\r\npretended fundamental thoughts, without first ascertaining whether these\r\nfundamental thoughts are really the leading principle of the system, and\r\nwhen he on his own side falls into suppositions which have certainly\r\nreceived long since a satisfactory refutation from the later philosophy;\r\nas, for example, in the Kantean opposition of things in themselves, and\r\ntheir appearances. The _positive_, with which Herr Schopenhauer believes\r\nthat he has enriched science, the derivation of united spiritual\r\nfunctions from the will, and the correction of the course of the world,\r\nby the idea that the true aim of life is to scorn it, might with greater\r\npropriety be classed in the sphere of 'visions and dispositions,' which\r\nhe so fiercely attacks, than in that of science. The discussions which\r\nfill these two volumes, and are spread out over every imaginable\r\nsubject, even to ghosts, the possibility of whose existence is admitted,\r\nhave naturally a very varied character, and can only, by a continued\r\npolemic, and a fragmentary system of examination harmonizing therewith,\r\nbe brought into unity.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe second part of WACHSMUTH'S _Allgemeine Culturgeschichte_ (History of\r\nCivilization, for so we venture to translate the word Cultur), which\r\nindicates more strictly all referring to those social influences which\r\nrefine, form, and educate society, has recently appeared. The volume\r\nreferred to contains _The Middle Ages_, and is highly spoken of for the\r\nskilful manner in which the author has treated the influence exerted by\r\nthe Byzantine and Mohammedan races. Another historical work of\r\nimportance is the fourth and concluding volume containing the tenth and\r\ntwelfth books of HAMMER PURGSTALL'S _Life of Cardinal Khlesl_, compiled\r\nfrom contemporary documents. In it we have the last diplomatic acts of\r\nthe Cardinal, of the intrigues of the Grand Dukes Ferdinand and\r\nMaximilian relative to him, and of his consequent arrest and abduction.\r\nThe eleventh book details his imprisonment in Innspruck and in the Abbey\r\nSt. Georgenberg, the negotiations with the Pope relative to him, and his\r\ndelivery to the latter on the 24th October, 1622. In the twelfth we have\r\nthe details of his residence in Rome, of the part he took in instituting\r\nthe Propaganda, his return home after an absence of ten years, his\r\nsubsequent clerical exertions, and his testament. The conclusion gives a\r\nparallel drawn between Khlesl, Wolsey, and Ximenes--a description of his\r\npersonal appearance and an explanation of the exertions of power brought\r\nto bear against him, with the final judgment that those truly to blame\r\nwere the grand dukes and not Khlesl, and that the Cardinal, if not\r\nentirely devoid of blame, was still a great character, and one of the\r\nmost illustrious statesmen of Austria. Another new historical work is\r\nthe _Laben des Herzogs von Sachsen-Gotha und Altenburg, Freiderich II.\r\nEin Bei trazzur Geschichte Gotha's beim Wechsel d. 17, und 18, Jahrh.\r\nHerausgegeben nach dessen Tode von Dr._ AD. MORITZ SCHULZE, _Director d.\r\nBurgerschule zu Gotha_ (or Life of the Duke of Saxe Gotha and Altenburg,\r\nFrederic the II.) A contribution to the history of Gotha during the\r\nchanges of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Published after the\r\ndeath of the author by Dr. Ad. Moritz Schulze, director of the Citizen\r\nSchool of Gotha, this work appears to be well and warmly, though\r\nimpartially written.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn theology, we observe the publication, by ALBERT WESSEL VON HENGEL, of\r\n_Commentarius Perpetuus in Prioris Pauli ad Corinthios Epistolae Caput\r\nQuintum Decimum cum Epistola ad Winerum, Theol. Lips. Haag._ (Boedeker\r\nin Rotterdam). In this book we perceive that the important fifteenth\r\nchapter of the Letter to the Corinthians is philologically treated with\r\ntrue Dutch thoroughness and remarkable erudition, but that the results\r\nto which he comes are often untenable, and that a satisfactory decision\r\nas to the proposed dogmatic questions, such as advanced theological\r\nscience requires, is not given. The peculiar views of the author as to\r\nthe aim or object of the chapter have also had an effect on the\r\nexplanation of many passages. It is asserted, for instance, _a la_ Bush,\r\nthat Paul does not speak of the resurrection of the body, but that he\r\nmeans by this resurrection the return of all men into life, or\r\nimmortality; and regarding this, has in view only those who admit\r\nChrist, and their future happiness; and that even verse forty-nine\r\ncontains only a comparison of the _moral_ condition of Christians in\r\nthis and a better life. Yet notwithstanding this he finds himself\r\ncompelled to admit, by the fifty-second verse, that the same bodies\r\nwhich we have here on earth, again return to life. By the [Greek:\r\nparousia] of Christ (v. 23) he understands _earthly life_, and by\r\n[Greek: oi tou Christou en te parousia autou], those Christians who\r\nalready believed on him while yet on earth, and by the [Greek: telos],\r\nnot the end of the world with its universal resurrection and judgment,\r\nbut the resurrection of the later Christians. The oft-repeated [Greek:\r\nspeiretai] (v. 43) he translates by it is begotten or generated, and\r\nunderstands it as referring to an entry into earthly life, and that the\r\n[Greek: choikos] of the forty-seventh verse refers to the earthly\r\n_disposition_ or _inclination_, and the [Greek: ex ournou] and [Greek:\r\nepouranios] to that of the heavenly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong recent books of travel we have _A Journey to Persia and the\r\ncountry of the Koords_, and the preceding sketch, _Souvenirs of the\r\nDanube and Bosphorus_, by MORITZ WAGNER. The Journey to Persia contains\r\nmuch curious information and observation of a country but little known\r\nto the outer world, while in the Souvenirs we have bitter complaints and\r\nmerciless revelations relative to the Metternich policy in the East, and\r\nthe conduct and character of the Austrian diplomatic representative by\r\nthe Porte. Many curious facts are also given relative to the present\r\ncondition of Turkey, the personal appearance of the Sultan and divers\r\nConstantinopolitan dignitaries and foreign ambassadors. The commendatory\r\ncharacteristic of this work appears to consist in the fact, that the\r\nauthor, unlike the great majority of those who are elevated to constant\r\nfamiliarity with men of high standing and influence, is remarkably\r\nindependent and unselfish in his views, and invariably speaks bold plain\r\ntruth, even of individuals in whose power it actually lies to do him\r\nvery decided injury. No person desirous of being _au courant_ as to the\r\ngreat political world of the present day, should be ignorant of this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA work has recently been published at Ratisbon, entitled. _Die\r\nKatholischon Missionen, Geschildert aus der Neuzeit, Miteinem Anhange,\r\nZwei Missionen in dem Jahr 1716 und 1718_ (Catholic Missions, Sketched\r\nfrom recent times, with a supplement; Two Missions in the years 1716 and\r\n1718). Of this performance a German review remarks, that it was once\r\nbelieved that the power of the Jesuits was for ever broken, but lo! they\r\nagain lift their heads in power. \"Missions are one of the means by which\r\nthey act upon the people--a number of Jesuits repair to a certain place,\r\nand day after day its inhabitants are preached to, taught, confessions\r\nheard, and mass read festally.\" The book is a eulogium of Catholicism,\r\nand especially of the Jesuits, as its truest representatives, with\r\noccasional passes at democracy, the unbelievers, the administration, and\r\nbureaucracy. It praises Catholicism as the only means whereby the\r\nrevolution can be restrained; it tells of devotions to the heart of the\r\nVirgin Mary and her medals, and of the plenary remission which the\r\nmissions bring. It exalts the obedience of the Jesuits to their\r\nsuperiors, and praises the principle that they, without any will of\r\ntheir own, should be _perinde ac cadaver_--like a corpse. According to\r\nthis book, the consequences of these missions are incalculable, and the\r\nlove bestowed upon them by the Jesuits truly affecting. It well-nigh\r\nappears the same as if one were reading Chateaubriand's praises of the\r\n_Patres_. Only that history, for the past three hundred years, has given\r\na somewhat strong contrast to this ideal. The best parts of the book are\r\nsketches of life in the _Bagnos_ of Toulon and Brest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt Berlin, the Scientific Society (_Winenschaftlicher Vereins_) have\r\nbeen giving a course of lectures to a large and aristocratic audience,\r\ninvited by members of the society. Their success has brought out the\r\nEvangelical Society, in another course of a more theological and\r\nreligious nature. In the first-named society, Professor Brandes lately\r\nlectured upon the Mormons; but it seems that the majority of the elegant\r\ngentlemen and ladies, did not fully appreciate his efforts for their\r\ninstruction, for want of the necessary elementary knowledge. \"When the\r\ndoctor rose and announced his subject, the question was at once\r\nwhispered in all parts of the hall,\" \"Who are the Mormons?\" The ladies\r\nin the most brilliant costume were generally the most eager in this\r\ninquiry. But unfortunately they got no satisfaction; the common reply of\r\nthe gentleman appealed to being, \"I am sorry to say I have forgotten.\"\r\nSome, more learned than others, however, assured their lovely companions\r\nthat the Mormons were an Indian tribe of America, closely connected\r\nwith, if not directly descended from, the Hurons, so frequently\r\nmentioned in Cooper's novels. Another amusing misunderstanding recently\r\noccurred in the same course. The lectures are not generally announced\r\nbefore-hand, but one day the newspapers got hold of the subject, and\r\ninformed all the world that Professor Diterici would read a lecture upon\r\n_Pera and the desert festivals_. A great crowd of ladies was the\r\nconsequence, all agog to hear about the picturesque costumes and strange\r\nways of Pera, the national festivals of the Bedouins, and, perhaps, to\r\nhave a glimpse at the mysteries of the seraglio. How great was the\r\ndisappointment of the fashionable auditory when the learned doctor rose\r\nand began his discourse upon _Petra, the Fastness of the Desert_. That\r\nevening the ladies went home in very ill humor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA work which political students and legislators may read, with\r\nadvantage, is the _Wesen und Verfassung der Laadgemeinde_ (Nature and\r\nConstitution of the Country Towns, and of the tenure of Real Estate in\r\nLower Saxony and Westphalia, with special regard to the Kingdom of\r\nHanover.) It is by Mr. STUVE, recently the Prime Minister of Hanover,\r\nand is interesting, especially as exhibiting the extent to which the\r\nprinciple of local self-government obtains in Germany, and the\r\nprobabilities and methods of its extension. For its historical view of\r\nthe organization of the _commune_ or township in Germany, it is very\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe second part of the _System of Ethics_, by IMANUEL HERMANN (not\r\nJohann Gottlieb) FICHTE, has recently appeared. The anticipations\r\nawakened by the first historico-critical part of the work do not appear\r\nto be satisfactorily realized by this second dogmatic division.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the most entertaining \"books of autobiography must always be\r\nreckoned _The Memoirs of the Margravine of Bayreuth_, daughter of\r\nFrederic William I., and sister of Frederic the Great of Prussia. They\r\nare among the chief sources of the history of the German states during\r\nthe last century, and they afford the most striking, if not the most\r\npleasing, view we have of aristocratic German manners for the same\r\nperiod. In the London _Literary Gazette_ it is stated that--\r\n\r\n     \"The revelations of the Princess, especially concerning the\r\n     King of Prussia and his court, if true, are at least not\r\n     flattering to the Prussian dynasty; and strenuous attempts\r\n     have for years past been making to represent the 'Memoirs of\r\n     the Margravine of Bayreuth' as a spurious work, concocted by\r\n     the enemies of Prussia, for the express purpose of\r\n     humiliating the descendants of Frederic William I. It so\r\n     happened, that at the first publication of the book, in\r\n     1810, a rival edition was almost immediately given to the\r\n     world in another part of Germany. The publishers of either\r\n     book pretended to be in exclusive possession of the original\r\n     MS. of the unfortunate Princess. These conflicting claims\r\n     furnished the partisans of the court of Berlin with a very\r\n     plausible pretext for doubting the genuineness of either.\r\n     But of late, Dr. Pertz, of Berlin, when engaged in\r\n     collecting still further proofs of the 'literary imposition'\r\n     practised by the editors of the two MS., happened to stumble\r\n     on the original autograph copy of the Princess among the\r\n     books and papers of the Protonotarius Blanet, at Celle, in\r\n     Hanover. Herr Blanet had the MS. from Dr. E. Spangenberg, of\r\n     Celle, who died in 1833, and who bought it from Colonel\r\n     Osten, who, in his turn, had received the MS. from Dr.\r\n     Superville, physician to the Princess, to whom it had been\r\n     presented by that lady. From a paper read by Dr. Pertz, to\r\n     the Royal Academy of Sciences at Berlin, (Berlin: Keimer.\r\n     London: Williams and Norgate,) it appears that, of the two\r\n     existing editions, the one published at Brunswick, in 1810,\r\n     is a copy, though not a faithful or complete one, of the\r\n     original MS. This copy in particular wants several sheets.\r\n     At all events, the question as to the genuineness of the\r\n     'Memoirs of the Margravine of Bayreuth' is now completely\r\n     set at rest; for although Dr. Pertz demonstrates at some\r\n     length that many important phrases and parts of phrases are\r\n     wanting in the Brunswick edition, he has not ventured to\r\n     affirm that any phrases or statements have been added by the\r\n     editor.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA recent book of travels published at Munich is not utterly devoid of\r\ninterest, though it appears to be far inferior to what we should have\r\nexpected from the subject. We refer to the _Errimerungen an Italien,\r\nSicilian and Grieohenland aus den Jahren, 1826-1844_ (Recollections of\r\nGreece, Italy, and Sicily, in the Years 1826-1844), by HEINRICH\r\nFARMBACHER. In company with the king of Bavaria, and as his secretary,\r\nHerr Farmbacher travelled twice to Sicily, once to Greece, and\r\nfrequently through Italy. The descriptions of scenes and events appear\r\nin no instance to rise above mediocrity, nor do we find any of that\r\nartistic spirit and observation which might have been anticipated from\r\nan intelligent attendant of the great royal connoisseur. His anecdotes\r\nrelative to the monarch himself are rare, trivial, and worthless, for it\r\ndoes not seem to have occurred to the royal secretary that in such a\r\nwork his master to the general reader is a far more attractive\r\nindividual than himself. As regards style, the book gives from time to\r\ntime curious glimpses of that court lackey language so habitual to the\r\nupper class _flunkies_ of Herr Farmbacher's description, and which it is\r\nimpossible for him to entirely suppress even in writing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe distinguished and lamented orientalist KLAPROTH has left behind him\r\na large map of Central Asia, in four sheets, engraved at Paris by\r\nBerthe, the geographer. This map is the product of ten years'\r\nresearches, and exhibits the topography of those vast regions, with the\r\ncities it contains, many of which have hitherto been unknown, and the\r\nnames of the tribes inhabiting it. The map is based not only upon the\r\nexplorations of travellers, but on the Chinese maps made by order of the\r\nEmperor Kiang-Long, and by missionaries in China and Tartary. It extends\r\non the north to the frontiers of Siberia, including the great lake\r\nBalaton; on the south to Hindostan; on the west to the sea of Aral and\r\nPersia; and on the east to China.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHAFIS is the title prefixed to a new collection of poems, by G. F.\r\nDAUMER, just published at Nuremberg. Daumer is one of the most original\r\nwriters in the whole scope of the present German literature. His\r\n_Evangelium_ is especially worthy of a far greater degree of attention\r\nthan it has received. It is a volume of brief poems, discussing the\r\ngravest questions with as much warmth and freshness of imagination as\r\nelevation and beauty of style. In this country Daumer is known but to\r\nthe few whose acquaintance with German literature extends beyond the\r\nclassic writers whose names are familiar to all the world. A Catholic\r\ncritic in Germany says of him, that the epitaph once proposed for the\r\ngravestone of Voltaire will suit equally well that of Daumer. It is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    \"In poesi magnus,\r\n    In historia parvus,\r\n    In philosophia minimus,\r\n    In religione nullus.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGUTZKOW'S _Ritter vom Geiste_ has just appeared in a second edition in\r\nGermany--no trifling success for a romance in nine stout volumes;\r\nanother German _litterateur_ has also dramatized a part of it. Gutzkow\r\nis, beyond dispute, one of the foremost among the living writers of\r\nGermany. His collected works, published some years since, in twelve\r\nvolumes, have lately been increased by a thirteenth, containing several\r\nfugitive stories, and one or two plays that he has brought out at\r\nvarious times.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe heard little of Scandinavian literature until the translations of\r\nTegner, Frederica Bremer, Oelenschlager, and Hans Christian Andersen,\r\ncalled our attention to the rich treasures of intellectual activity\r\nproduced under that cold northern sky. Of course constant additions are\r\nbeing made to this literature. Among its recent productions is a comedy\r\nby ANDERSEN, based on a fairy story, called _Hyldemoeer_, which has\r\nlately been performed upon the Danish stage with not very brilliant\r\nsuccess. It is admitted to be inferior to his stories, as have been his\r\nformer attempts at dramatic composition. C. MOLBACH announces, at\r\nCopenhagen, a Danish translation of DANTE'S _Divina Commedia_; the same\r\nauthor has just published a volume of original poems under the title of\r\n_Twilight_. A very industriously-prepared and useful work is J. H.\r\nEOSLEN'S _General Literary Dictionary_, from the year 1814 to 1840, of\r\nwhich the thirteenth part has just appeared. In Norway, F. M. BUGGE\r\nannounces a translation of the _Iliad_ into Norwegian hexameters, to be\r\npublished by subscription. A Norwegian dictionary, by IWAR AASEN is\r\nhighly commended.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA very sharp controversy is now being waged by the scholars of Denmark\r\nand Schleswig. The Danes resort to philology in order to prove the right\r\nof their country to extend its government over the Germans of that\r\nDuchy, and the other party meet their onslaught with weapons equally\r\nkeen, drawn also from the arsenals of dictionaries and grammars. The\r\nbest of the quarrel hitherto seems to be on the side of the\r\nSchleswigers, whose great champion is one Herr Clement, a man of as much\r\nlearning as talent. In a recent essay, he establishes that the original\r\ninhabitants of Schleswig were not Danes but Angles, or Frieslanders,\r\nessentially the same race as the original Saxon stock of England. In\r\nillustration of this doctrine he adduces an immense list of names of\r\nplaces which are the same in Schleswig and England--as, for instance,\r\nRipen and Ripon, Ellum and Elham, Roedding and Reading, Meldorp and\r\nMilthorp, Wilstrup and Wilthorpe, &c., &c. This essay will probably be\r\nexpanded into a book.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe German critics are discussing with high encomiums a volume of poems\r\nby ANNETTE VON DROSTE, a deceased poetess of Westphalia. It is entitled\r\n_Das Religioese Jahr_ (The Religious Year), and is inspired with that\r\nabsolute devotion which lends so great a charm to the poems of\r\nMontgomery, the Moravians, and the mystical writers generally.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBYRON'S _Manfred_, with musical accompaniments, by R. Schumann, is about\r\nto be produced at the Weimar theatre.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJAHN, the well-known Leipsic professor, is engaged in writing a life of\r\nBeethoven.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRICHARD WAGNER, the revolutionist, musical composer, and writer upon\r\naesthetics, has published a new work, entitled _Oper und Drama_ (Opera\r\nand Drama), which the German critics fall upon with considerable\r\nferocity. They complain that while he entirely rejects the old form of\r\nthe opera, he does not indicate what is the new kind of musical drama to\r\nbe substituted for it. Wagner has also published _Three Opera Poems_,\r\nwhich the same critics cannot but praise for their originality, power,\r\nand inspiration. If the music of these operas is adequate to the\r\n_libretti_, say they, they are really new and grand productions. This\r\nwould seem, also, to be proved by the fact that one of them has been\r\nbrought out at Weimar, through the influence and under the direction of\r\nLiszt. The author is living in exile in Switzerland, and is engaged upon\r\na dramatic trilogy with a prelude. He no longer professes to write\r\noperas, but musical dramas.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn attempt has been made in Germany to register the enormous number of\r\nbooks and pamphlets which the Germans themselves have published on their\r\ntwo great poets, Goethe and Schiller. A catalogue of the Goethean\r\nliterature in Germany, from 1793 to 1851, has been published by Balde,\r\nat Cassel, and in London by Williams and Norgate. The Schiller\r\nliterature, from 1781 to 1851, is likewise announced by the same firm.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA very excellent translation of sundry old Scottish and English ballads\r\nhas just made its appearance at Munich, from the pen of W. DOENNIGER. It\r\ncontains sixteen Scotch and seventeen English ballads, from the\r\nfourteenth to the seventeenth centuries, all rendered with great\r\nfidelity, and in the true spirit of the original. So successful is the\r\nbook that a second edition of it is about to appear, with illustrations\r\nby Kaulbach, Voltzen, and other eminent artists.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Augsburg Gazette_ states that the Congregation of the Index has\r\njust prohibited all the works of Eugene Sue and Proudhon; also a\r\nclerical Turin paper, called the _Buona Novella_; a work on animal\r\nmagnetism, by Tomasi; a manual for schoolmasters, printed at Asti in\r\n1850; and all the works of Gioberti.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA book to be read by the students of literature and by critics is\r\nHETTNER'S _Moderne Drama_, just published at Brunswick. We do not know\r\nof a profounder and keener discussion of the principles and laws of\r\ndramatic writing, or of more just and striking dramatic criticisms than\r\nit contains.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLAYARD'S popular account of his excavations and discoveries at Nineveh\r\nhas been translated into German by one of the Meissners (not the poet,\r\nwe believe), and is published at Leipsic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFRAULEIN FRIEDERIKE FRIEDEMANN has published, at Leipsic, a metrical\r\nversion of Lord BYRON'S _Corsair_, which is worthy of all commendation.\r\nThe gloomy hue and passionate vehemence of the original are preserved in\r\nthe translation with surprising fidelity, and the rhythm is hardly less\r\nperfect than in Byron's English itself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe last number of the _Theologische Quartalschrift_ (Theological\r\nQuarterly), published at Tuebingen, by Laupp, contains an interesting\r\npaper on the pretended objections to the historical truth of the\r\nPentateuch, by WELTE; the critical historical examination of the xxxi.\r\nxxxii.

GEORGE STEPHENS, the translator of Tegner's _Frithiof's Saga_, and\r\nwhose intimate acquaintance with the early literature of Sweden has been\r\nshown by the collection of legends of that country which he edited in\r\nconjunction with Hylten-Cavallius, and by various works superintended by\r\nhim for the _Svenska Fornskrift-Salskapet_, (a sort of Stockholm Camden\r\nSociety,) has removed to Copenhagen in consequence of his having been\r\nappointed Professor of the English Language and Literature in the\r\nUniversity there. The subject of his first course of lectures was\r\nChaucer's Canterbury Tales. We have in our possession the MS.\r\ntranslations of some very interesting ancient Swedish poems made by Mr.\r\nStephens some five years ago, and not yet published.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe London _Leader_, socialist and avowedly and industriously infidel,\r\nsays of EUGENE SUE, not long ago the rage of half the world:\r\n\r\n     \"We have to announce the third and last volume of Eugene\r\n     Sue's _Fernand Duplessis_, wherein the memoirs of a husband\r\n     are recounted with a license which only a French public\r\n     could permit. Perhaps the worst thing in Sue is not his\r\n     positive passion for what is criminal and odious, so much as\r\n     the way in which he always contrives to render the good\r\n     people odious. Much as we reprobate his pictures of vice, we\r\n     think them less offensive than his pictures of virtue. How a\r\n     man so essentially vulgar-minded could ever have attained\r\n     the position he had once!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. ALFRED VILLEFORT has published at Paris a treatise on literary and\r\nartistic property in an international point of view. It not only\r\ndiscusses the question as a matter of principle, but gives the history\r\nof the negotiations and treaties which France has made in that respect\r\nwith the nations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the pleasant books recently published in France is ARSENE\r\nHOUSSAYE'S volume of stories, _Les Filles d'Eve_, very piquant and\r\nFrench in its treatment. A translation is announced in this city by\r\nRedfield.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe literary event of the month at Paris is the publication of the third\r\nvolume of LOUIS BLANC'S _History of the French Revolution_. Of all the\r\nworks written upon that memorable epoch, none is more marked by\r\noriginality of thought and power of treatment than this, and we can only\r\nhope that the present volume, which we have not yet seen, may prove\r\nequal to its predecessors. Its table of contents is as follows: Attitude\r\nof Property toward the Revolution, Attitude of the Gospel toward the\r\nRevolution, Tableau of the Constituent Assembly, First Labors of the\r\nConstituent Assembly, Administration of Necker, People Starving,\r\nTreasury Empty, A New Power, Journalism, Faction of the Count de\r\nProvence, The Fifteen Complots, The Women of Versailles, The King\r\nbrought to Paris, The Court at the Tuileries, Municipal and Military\r\nOrganization of the Bourgeoisie, The Wealth of the Clergy Denounced, War\r\nof the Bourgeoisie on the Clergy, The Authority of the Parliaments\r\nDiscussed, War of the Bourgeoisie on the Parliaments, The Ambition of\r\nMirabeau, Complots of the Luxembourg, New Organization of the Kingdom.\r\nThe _Leader_ mentions that Mr. Blanc undertakes to _prove_ that Egalite\r\nwas not at the bottom of those conspiracies with which his name has been\r\nassociated, but that the real culprit was the Comte de Provence,\r\nafterwards Louis XVIII.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. EDMOND TEXIER, one of the most fresh and agreeable of that race of\r\nliterary butterflies, the _feuilletonists_ of Paris, is publishing a\r\nlarge work upon that great capital, which promises to be as readable as\r\nits exterior is splendid. It is to be ornamented with some two thousand\r\nengravings on wood, representing all the prominent and famous public\r\nedifices and places which not only figure so largely in history, but are\r\nso splendid in themselves. The title of M. Texier's work is the _Tableau\r\nde Paris_. It appears in parts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe publication of the magnificent work, the _Catacombs de Rome_, for\r\nwhich the French National Assembly voted $40,000, will shortly commence,\r\nunder the direction of a commission nominated by the Government,\r\nconsisting of Messrs. Ampere (now in the United States), Ingres,\r\nProsper, Merinice, and Vitel, all members of the Institute. The work\r\nwill contain exact copies of the architecture, mural paintings,\r\ninscriptions, figures, symbols, sepulchres, lamps, vases, rings,\r\ninstruments, in a word, of every thing belonging to, or connected with,\r\nthe primitive Christians, which by the most diligent search, exercised\r\nduring many years, have been brought to light in the catacombs of\r\nancient Rome. Its enormous price, between $250 and $300, will, however,\r\nkeep it out of the hands of all but the wealthy. Another work on the\r\nsame subject and of similar character is announced in Rome, under the\r\ndirection of the ecclesiastical government.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA volume purporting to contain thirty hitherto unpublished Letters of\r\nSHELLEY, appeared a few weeks ago from the press of Moxon, in London,\r\nedited by Robert Browning. It appears from an article in the _Athenaeum_\r\nthat these--letters, and many others recently sold to publishers and\r\nautograph collectors, are forgeries. The book referred to is of course\r\nsuppressed. The _Athenaeum_ inquires:\r\n\r\n     \"From whom did Mr. Moxon buy these letters? They were bought\r\n     at Sotheby & Wilkinson's, at large prices. From whom did\r\n     Messrs. Sotheby and Wilkinson receive them for sale? 'We had\r\n     them from Mr. White, the bookseller in Pall Mall, over\r\n     against the Reform Club.' Off runs the gentle man-detective.\r\n     'From whom did you, Mr. White, obtain these letters?' 'I\r\n     bought them of two women--I believed them to be genuine, and\r\n     I paid large prices for them in that belief.' Such are the\r\n     words supposed to have been spoken by Mr. White. The two\r\n     women would appear to have been like the man in a\r\n     clergyman's band, but with a lawyer's gown, who brought\r\n     Pope's letters to Curll.\r\n\r\n     \"It is proper to say thus early that there has been of late\r\n     years, as we are assured, a most systematic and wholesale\r\n     forgery of letters purporting to be written by Byron,\r\n     Shelley, and Keats,--that these forgeries carry upon them\r\n     such marks of genuineness as have deceived the entire body\r\n     of London collectors,--that they are executed with a skill\r\n     to which the forgeries of Chatterton and Ireland can lay no\r\n     claim,--that they have sold at public auctions, and by the\r\n     hands of booksellers, to collectors of experience and\r\n     rank--and that the imposition has extended to a large\r\n     collection of books bearing not only the signature of Lord\r\n     Byron, but notes in many of their pages--the matter of the\r\n     letters being selected with a thorough knowledge of Byron's\r\n     life and feelings, and the whole of the books chosen with\r\n     the minutest knowledge of his tastes and peculiarities.\r\n\r\n     \"But the 'marvel' of the forgery is not yet told. At the\r\n     same sale at which Mr. Moxon bought the Shelley letters were\r\n     catalogued for sale a series of (unpublished) letters from\r\n     Shelley to his wife, revealing the innermost secrets of his\r\n     heart, and containing facts, not wholly dishonorable facts\r\n     to a father's memory, but such as a son would wish to\r\n     conceal. These letters were bought in by the son of Shelley,\r\n     the present Sir Percy Shelley--and are now proved, we are\r\n     told, to be forgeries. To impose on the credulity of a\r\n     collector is a minor offence compared with the crime of\r\n     forging evidence against the dead, and still minor as, in\r\n     one instance, against the fidelity of a woman.\r\n\r\n     \"The forgery of Chatterton injured no one but an imaginary\r\n     priest; the forgery of Ireland made a great poet seem to\r\n     write worse than Settle could have written; but this forgery\r\n     blackens the character of a great man, and, worse still,\r\n     traduces female virtue.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Moxon is not the only publisher taken in. Mr. Murray\r\n     has been a heavy sufferer, though not to the same extent.\r\n     Mr. Moxon has printed his Shelley purchases; Mr.\r\n     Murray--wise through Mr. Moxon's example--_will not_ publish\r\n     his Byron acquisitions.\"\r\n\r\nThese forgeries seem to us to have been very clumsily executed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe London _Athenaeum_ contains a very interesting letter from Mr. PAYNE\r\nCOLLIER, in which he gives an account of the discovery of a copy of the\r\nsecond folio edition of Shakspeare, with numerous important corrections\r\nof the text, apparently by some learned contemporary actor, whose memory\r\nof parts, or access to original MSS., enabled him to restore all the\r\nreadings vitiated by careless transcription or printing. Mr. Collier has\r\nsuch faith in these _errata_ that he does not hesitate to avow that he\r\nwould have adopted a large portion of them in his own edition of\r\nShakspeare, had they been known to him when that was printed. Of the\r\nseveral instances he offers, this will serve as a specimen:\r\n\r\n     \"An embarrassment meets us in the very outset of _Measure\r\n     for Measure_,--where the Duke, addressing Escalus, observes,\r\n     in the ordinary reading:\r\n\r\n    \"'Of government the properties to unfold\r\n    Would seem in me t' affect speech and discourse;\r\n    Since I am put to know, that your own science\r\n    Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice\r\n    My strength can give you: then, no more remains,\r\n    But that to your sufficiency as your worth is able,\r\n    And let them work.'\r\n\r\n     --The meaning is pretty evident; but the expression of that\r\n     meaning is obscure and corrupt,--as indeed the measure alone\r\n     would establish. Various conjectural modes of setting the\r\n     passage right have been proposed; and perhaps what follows\r\n     from my corrected folio of 1632 has no better\r\n     foundation,--but, at all events, it restores both the sense\r\n     and the metre, and may, for aught we know, give the very\r\n     words of Shakspeare:\r\n\r\n    \"'Of government the properties to unfold\r\n    Would seem in me t' affect speech and discourse;\r\n    Since I am _apt_ to know, that your own science\r\n    Exceeds (in that) the lists of all advice\r\n    My strength can give you; Then, no more remains\r\n    But _add_ to your sufficiency your worth,\r\n    And let them work.'\r\n\r\n     --How 'that' in the old editions came to be printed for\r\n     _add_ and how 'is able' came to be foisted in, most\r\n     unnecessarily and awkwardly, at the end of the same line, it\r\n     is not easy to explain. The third line is also much cleared\r\n     by the substitution of _apt_ for 'put,'--which was an easy\r\n     misprint: 'Apt to know' is an expression of every-day\r\n     occurrence.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSIR JAMES STEPHEN, whose excellent _Lectures on the History of France_\r\nhave been so well received, proposes to deliver, at Cambridge, a series\r\nof twenty lectures on the _Diplomatic History of France during the reign\r\nof Louis XIV._, comprising a review of the treaties of Westphalia, of\r\nthe Pyrenees, of Breda, of the Triple Alliance, of Aix-la-Chapelle, of\r\nNimeguen, of Ryswick, and of Utrecht.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMISS CHARLOTTE VANDENHOFF, whose professional tour in the United States\r\nwill be remembered by old play-goers, has written a piece under the\r\ntitle of _Woman's Heart_, possessing considerable poetical merits, and\r\nherself sustained the character of the heroine in its representation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR. CARLYLE, is engaged upon a new work in history, but its subject is\r\nnot disclosed, nor its extent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMRS. ROBINSON, who left New-York several months ago to visit her\r\nrelations in Germany, writes from Berlin to the _Athenaeum_, under date\r\nof February 2, as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"A work appeared in London last summer with the following\r\n     title: _Talvi's History of the Colonization of America_,\r\n     edited by William Hazlitt, in two volumes. It seems proper\r\n     to state that the original work was written under favorable\r\n     circumstances _in German_, and published in Germany. It\r\n     treated only of the colonization of _New England_: and that\r\n     only stood on its title-page. The above English publication,\r\n     therefore, is a mere translation, and it was made without\r\n     the consent or knowledge of the author. The very title is a\r\n     misnomer; all references to authorities are omitted; and the\r\n     whole work teems with errors, not only of the press, but\r\n     also of translation,--the latter such as could have been\r\n     made by no person well acquainted with the German and\r\n     English tongues. For the work in this form, therefore, the\r\n     author can be in no sense whatever responsible.\r\n\r\n                                        TALVI.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a more recent number of the _Athenaeum_ it appears that Mr. Hazlitt\r\nis not himself the translator of the original work; and the\r\nresponsibility, not only of the translation, but of all the faults\r\ncharged which might seem more especially editorial, is transferred by\r\nhim to another. Mr. Hazlitt, we believe, is a son of the great critic of\r\nthe last age.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are connected with the newspapers a considerable number of\r\nweak-minded and absurd persons, who delight in strange coincidences and\r\nthe most inconceivable relations, and who, for a certain consciousness\r\nthey have of their own slight claims to consideration are anxious to\r\nfind on every occasion, some indication of regard for their vocation, as\r\nif credit won by any journalist or writer were portion of a common fund\r\nof respectability from which they could draw a dividend. In no other way\r\ncan we account for the thousand-and-one articles in which the\r\nappointments of Dr. LAYARD and Mr. D'ISRAELI have been referred to as\r\n\"honor,\" \"homage,\" &c., to literature. Dr. Layard was selected by Lord\r\nGranville to be an Under-Secretary of State, because he had shown\r\nhimself in the admirable manner in which he discharged certain important\r\ndiplomatic functions in the East, better fitted, in Lord Granville's\r\nopinion, than any other person for the new duties to which it was\r\nproposed to summon him. Mr. D'Israeli has long been one of the most\r\nconspicuous and astute politicians in England, and owes his present\r\noffice solely to his activity and eminence in affairs. There was as\r\nlittle of \"recognition of the claims of literature\" in either case, as\r\nthere was praise of fiddlesticks or Carolina potatoes. It would not be a\r\nwhit more ridiculous to say that the French people, remembering the\r\nhappy genius displayed by Napoleon Bonaparte in his \"Supper of\r\nBeaucaire,\" chose him to be their emperor.\r\n\r\nIn the new British ministry are an unusual number of book-makers. The\r\nmost conspicuous in authorship is the now Right Honorable Benjamin\r\nD'Israeli, \"the wondrous boy who wrote _Alroy_, in rhyme and prose, only\r\nto show how long ago victorious Judah's lion banner rose.\" Sir Emerson\r\nTennent, Sir Edward Sugden, Lord John Manners, Mr. Whiteside, the Earl\r\nof Malmesbury, Lord de Roos, are all known as authors, as well as\r\npoliticians. The Duke of Northumberland also is favorably known as a\r\nzealous promoter of arts and learning.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe author of _Life in Bombay and the Neighboring Stations_, pays the\r\nfollowing testimony to the abilities of the manoeuvring mammas of\r\nBombay: \"The bachelor civilians are always the grand aim; for, however\r\nyoung in the service they may be, their income is always vastly above\r\nthat of the military man, to say nothing of the noble provision made by\r\nthe fund for their widows and children. We remember being greatly\r\namused, soon after our arrival in the country, at overhearing a lady\r\nsay, in reference to her daughter's approaching marriage with a young\r\ncivilian: 'Certainly, I could have wished my son-in-law to be a little\r\nmore steady; but then it is L300 a-year for my girl, dead or alive!'\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA volume of brilliant French criticism will be published in a few days\r\nby Charles Scribner, under the title of _Anglo-American Literature and\r\nManners_, by PHILARETE CHASLES, Professor in the College of France. Mr.\r\nChasles, in a book of five hundred pages, considers the literature and\r\nmanners of the people of the United States--their institutions, capacity\r\nfor self-government, actual condition and probable future--with all the\r\nsprightly grace of a Frenchman, and with a great deal of cleverness\r\nprosecutes his industrious researches from the landing of the Mayflower\r\nto the present day. He finds in the United States neither an Utopia, nor\r\na land worthy merely of ridicule. He does not simply condemn, like some\r\ntravellers, nor give us universal and unreasonable praise, as our\r\negotism and contentment lead us to desire, but takes a fair view of the\r\ncountry, its claims, position, and prospects. In the beginning of his\r\nperformance he considers that the most essential thing for the founding\r\nof a new commonwealth, is moral force; this he finds in the Puritans,\r\nwho possessed \"sincerity, belief, perseverance, courage;\" they could\r\n\"wait, fight, suffer.\" Their energy, he thinks, comes from their\r\nTeutonic or Saxon blood; their indomitable perseverance is a fruit of\r\nCalvinism, added to which they are clannish, or mutual helpers one of\r\nanother. This is the key to the philosophical, political and prophetic\r\nportion of his work. The literary part is honest criticism, freely\r\nspoken, by the aid of such light as happened to be around him. He begins\r\nwith the landing of the Pilgrims, speaks of their literature, which,\r\nlike all other American literature down to the present day, he regards\r\nas destitute of originality. Franklin, Jonathan Edwards, and others, all\r\nlack this quality. The author of the _American Cultivator_ has the most\r\nof it; but Franklin is made up of Fenelon, Banyan, and Addison; Edwards\r\npartakes of Hobbes, Priestley, and in his better moments of the close\r\nreasoning Descartes. He gives us then a politician, a journalist, and a\r\ngentleman, \"the American Aristocrat\" as he calls him, Gouverneur Morris,\r\nour minister at Paris during the old revolution. Brockden Brown is\r\ncharacterized as a copyist of Monk Lewis; and he comes then to\r\nWashington Irving, but while all the charms of this delightful writer\r\nare thoroughly appreciated and minutely described, it is denied that he\r\nhas originality. \"In some square house in Boston, he sees in thought St.\r\nJames's Park: in reveries he is led through the umbrageous alleys of\r\nKensington--he talks with Sterne--he shakes hands with Goldsmith.\" \"It\r\nis a copy, somewhat timid, of Addison, of Steele, of Swift.\" You would\r\nthink of him as of \"a young lady of good family, a slave to propriety,\r\nnever elevating her voice, never exaggerating the _ton_, never\r\ncommitting the sin of eloquence;\" \"a refined continuation of the style\r\nof Addison,\" &c. Nevertheless a dawn of freshness appears in his\r\nwritings when they treat of forest scenes. This dawn advances into day\r\nin Cooper, upon whom we have an admirable critique. The author of _The\r\nSpy_, M. Chasles thinks, has a native vigor unknown to Irving. Paulding\r\nis dismissed with but very little consideration. Channing occupies the\r\ncritic longer, but is found to be an unsatisfactory and too general\r\nreasoner. Audubon furnishes the most attractive chapter in the book,\r\nwhich closes with what is called the First Literary Epoch of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe next division is of the _Literature of the People, and the falsely\r\npopular Literature of England and the States_. One thoughtful chapter is\r\ngiven to the infancy and future of America; the age and despair of\r\nEurope, of emigration, and colonization. Then, the popular movements in\r\nFrance and England are treated of, and the education of the masses.\r\nCrabbe, Burns, Elliott, Thomas Cooper and others serve as a text.\r\nPopular literature is found to be less anarchical in America than in\r\nEurope. We have a chapter on Herman Melville; and then the Americans are\r\nviewed through the spectacles of Marryatt, Trolloppe, Dickens, and their\r\nexaggerations are noted. The force of public opinion and of the press\r\nconclude the section. Our poets have two chapters: I. Barlow, Dwight,\r\nColton, Payne, Sprague, Dana, Drake, Pierrepont; Female Poets; and\r\nStreet and Halleck. II, Bryant, Emerson, and Longfellow. _Tom\r\nStapleton_, by an Irish Sunday newspaper reporter, and _Puffer Hopkins_,\r\nby Mr. Cornelius Matthews, one chapter; Stephens, Silliman, and others\r\nrepresent the travellers; a chapter is dedicated to Arnold and Andre;\r\nHaliburton's _Sam Slick_ concludes the criticism; and the book ends with\r\n_The Future of Septentrional America and the United States_--what a\r\n\"Bee\" is, how an American village is got up, the aggregative principles\r\nof Americans, the Lowell Lectures, Democrats and Whigs--and then,\r\nfar-seeing prophetic talking, conclude what the author has to say about\r\nus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe well-known school book publishers of Philadelphia, THOMAS,\r\nCOWPERTHWAIT, & CO., have just published a large duodecimo of five\r\nhundred and fifty-eight pages. _The Standard Speaker, containing\r\nExercises in Prose and Poetry, for Declamation in Schools, Academies,\r\nLyceums, and Colleges, newly Translated or Compiled from celebrated\r\nOrators, Authors, and Popular Debaters, Ancient and Modern; a Treatise\r\non Oratory and Elocution; and Notes Explanatory and Biographical_--by\r\nEPES SARGENT. This book bears abundant evidences of editorial research\r\nand labor. The original translations would form a volume of respectable\r\nsize, and they are all strikingly adapted to the purpose of elocutionary\r\npractice. Some passages of fervid eloquence from Mirabeau, Robespierre\r\nand Victor Hugo are given. Ancient eloquence is also well represented in\r\nnew and spirited translations. The department of British Parliamentary\r\noratory, shows extracts from Pym, Chatham, Barre, Wilkes, Thurlow,\r\nGrattan, Pitt, Fox, Sheridan, Curran, Canning, Brougham, O'Connell,\r\nSheil, Macaulay, Croker, Talfourd, Palmerston, Cobden, and many others,\r\nand in nine instances out of ten the exercises are compiled originally\r\nfor this volume. The American department is quite rich, and while the\r\nold masterpieces of Patrick Henry, Ames, Randolph, Clay, Calhoun,\r\nWebster, Hayne, and others are retained, a large number of fresh and\r\nstriking pieces are introduced from the eloquence of Congress and the\r\nAmerican lecture room.\r\n\r\nIn its dramatic and poetical novelties the work is of course amply\r\nsupplied. Mr. Sargent's editorial experience here has enabled him to add\r\nmuch that other compilers have entirely overlooked. In the adaptation of\r\nthe exercises, great discrimination has been shown. They are of the\r\nright length, pithy, and calculated to engage the attention of the\r\nyoung. A new and valuable feature of the work is the introduction of\r\nnotes, biographical and explanatory. In the instances of authors not\r\ncontemporary the dates of their birth and death are given. An\r\nintroductory treatise, comprising much practical information on the\r\nsubject of elocution, gives completeness to the volume. Such is the\r\nStandard Speaker; and while it will be found to justify its title in the\r\nretention of all the standard specimens of rhetoric suitable for its\r\npurposes, it presents in its large proportion of new exercises of a high\r\ncharacter, fresh and enduring claims to popularity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Memoirs of Margaret Fuller Ossoli_, by RALPH WALDO EMERSON, WILLIAM\r\nELLERY CHANNING, and JAMES FREEMAN CLARKE, published a few weeks ago by\r\nPhillips, Sampson & Co., of Boston, are generally praised in the\r\ncritical journals, but in this country, where the subject was generally\r\nknown in literary circles, there is a common feeling of surprise at the\r\nartistic and successful _exaggeration_ of her capacities and virtues.\r\nThe book, however, is in parts delightfully written, and the melancholy\r\nfate of the heroine gives it a character of romance apart from its\r\nmerits as a biographical and critical composition. The _Athenaeum_ thus\r\nrefers to some additional _material_ for her memoirs, which, it strikes\r\nus, should have been communicated to the custodians of her reputation at\r\nan earlier day:\r\n\r\n     \"We have received permission to state that poor Margaret\r\n     Fuller, on the eve of that visit to the Continent which was\r\n     to prove so eventful and disastrous, left in the hands of a\r\n     friend in London a sealed packet, containing, it is\r\n     understood, the journals which she kept during her stay in\r\n     England. Margaret Fuller--as they who saw her here all\r\n     know--contemplated at that time a return to England at no\r\n     very distant date;--and the deposit of these papers was\r\n     accompanied by an injunction that the packet should then be\r\n     restored with unbroken seal into her hands. No provision was\r\n     of course made for death:--and here we believe the lady in\r\n     possession feels herself in a difficulty, out of which she\r\n     does not clearly see her way. The papers are likely to be of\r\n     great interest, and were doubtless intended for publication;\r\n     but the writer had peremptorily reserved the right of\r\n     revision to herself, and forbidden the breaking of the\r\n     seals, on a supposition which fate has now made impossible.\r\n     It seems to us, that the equity of the case under such\r\n     circumstances demands only a reference to Margaret Fuller's\r\n     heir, whoever that may be; and with his or her concurrence,\r\n     the lady to whom these MSS. were intrusted--and who probably\r\n     knows something of the author's feeling as to their\r\n     contents--may very properly constitute herself literary\r\n     executor to her unfortunate friend.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf BAYARD TAYLOR _The Tribune_ said a few days ago:\r\n\r\n     \"By the Niagara's mail we have had the pleasure of receiving\r\n     letters from our friend and associate Bayard Taylor,--or as\r\n     he his known among the Arabs, Taylor Bey,--dated at\r\n     Khartoum, the chief city of Sennaar, situated at the\r\n     confluence of the White and the Blue Nile, about half way\r\n     between Cairo and the Equator. He arrived there on the 12th\r\n     of January in excellent health and spirits, after a journey\r\n     on camels across the Nubian Desert, during which he had\r\n     sundry fortunate adventures, and received every friendly\r\n     attention from the native chieftains. He was the first\r\n     American ever seen so far toward Central Africa, and like a\r\n     good patriot never slept without the stars and stripes\r\n     floating above his tent. Every where good luck had attended\r\n     him,--in truth he seems to have been born to it,--but at\r\n     Khartoum especially he was received with unexpected honors.\r\n     The governor of the city had presented him with a horse, and\r\n     had entertained him in a banquet of genuine Ethiopic\r\n     magnificence, while the commander of the troops had\r\n     stationed a nightly guard of honor around his tent. In\r\n     company with Dr. Knoblecher, the venerable Catholic\r\n     missionary bound for the equatorial regions whom he had\r\n     overtaken at Khartoum, and of Dr. Deitz, the Austrian\r\n     Counsel, Mr. Taylor had also attended a banquet at the\r\n     palace of the daughter of the late king of Sennaar, a very\r\n     stately and ebon princess, who entertained her guests\r\n     chiefly upon sheep roasted whole. Others of the first\r\n     families among the Ethiopian aristocracy had also welcomed\r\n     the strangers with distinguished civilities. Mr. Taylor\r\n     expected to reach Cairo on his return about the 1st of\r\n     April, though we should not be surprised to learn that he\r\n     had changed his mind, and, in company with the Jesuit\r\n     mission, plunged still farther into the mysterious country\r\n     about the equator and the sources of the Nile.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeveral new works by our literary women are on the eve of publication.\r\nRedfield has nearly ready _Lyra and other Poems_, by ALICE CAREY--a book\r\ncontaining more illustrations of unquestionable genius than any other\r\nwritten by a woman in America; and he will also publish soon, _Isa, a\r\nPilgrimage_, a romance by Miss Caroline CHEESEBRO', which is likely to\r\nattract a great deal of attention. Putnam has in press, _The Shield, a\r\nStory of the New World_, by Miss FENIMORE COOPER, whose _Rural Hours_,\r\nlast year, commanded every where so much well-merited praise, and a new\r\nstory by Miss WARNER, of whose _Wide, Wide World_ (edited in London by a\r\n\"Clergyman of the Church of England\"), a recent number of the _Literary\r\nGazette_ says:\r\n\r\n     \"This American tale has met with extraordinary success\r\n     across the Atlantic. Within a very short time several large\r\n     impressions were disposed of, and the sale still continues\r\n     to be rapid. Of the causes of this popularity, there is one\r\n     which will rather operate against a similar run of favor on\r\n     this side of the water. A large part of the book refers to\r\n     'the old country,' and American readers eagerly seek what\r\n     pertains to English life or history. But the book has many\r\n     merits, apart from the incidents of its scenery and\r\n     character. The authoress writes with liveliness and\r\n     elegance; her power of discriminating and presenting\r\n     character is great; in describing the feelings and ways of\r\n     young people, she is especially happy, and an air of\r\n     cheerful piety pervades the whole work. We shall not attempt\r\n     to give any idea of the story, or of its principal\r\n     personages, but content ourselves with commending it as a\r\n     book which will please and instruct others than the young,\r\n     for whom it is chiefly intended. The authoress seems herself\r\n     young, and if so, we may expect other works from a spirit so\r\n     lively and communicative. Who the editor is we have no\r\n     knowledge, but he has taken liberties with the original not\r\n     always warranted, and to an extent greater than can be\r\n     approved without previous consultation. On the whole,\r\n     however, he has done his part well, and in his prefatory\r\n     note justly characterizes the merits of the writer, of whom\r\n     we shall gladly hear more.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Warner's new book is entitled _Queechy_--the name of its scene, we\r\nsuppose--and it is said to be very different in character from her first\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. DUNGLISON'S _Medical Dictionary_, of which a new and much enlarged\r\nedition has been published by Blanchard & Lea, is one of those\r\nprofessional works which are almost indispensable in a gentleman's\r\nlibrary. Every person has sometimes occasion to consult a work of this\r\nkind, and there is no other in English so masterly in treatment, or so\r\nperspicuous in style. Dr. Dunglison keeps up with all the departments of\r\nthe literature of his science, and, through his quick, comprehensive,\r\nand practical understanding, we have in this volume the best results of\r\nthe world's experiment and study in medicine down to the beginning of\r\nthe present half century.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA new and complete edition of the Poetical Works of GEORGE P. MORRIS\r\nwill be published in October, amply and most elaborately illustrated\r\nwith engravings after original designs by Robert W. Weir. The\r\ndistinction of Gen. Morris is, that he is a great song writer. The\r\nnaturalness, simplicity, unity, and pervading grace of his pieces, do\r\nnot so much constitute their characteristic, as the exquisite music of\r\ntheir cadences, justifying the praise of Braham, that they sing\r\nthemselves. The new edition will surpass any other in completeness, and\r\nin artistic execution will not be inferior to any volume ever published\r\nin the United States.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. C.

The personal history of an American in Hungary, who\r\nenjoyed rare opportunities of intimate intercourse with the inhabitants,\r\nwill be a very valuable addition to our literature, and will make a most\r\nreadable and seasonable book. Of the quality of Mr. BRACE'S ability, and\r\nof the faithfulness of his observation and record, his letters to the\r\nNew-York _Tribune_ are satisfactory evidence.

It contains a\r\ncomplete history of the revolutionary proceedings in the Austrian empire\r\nin 1848. Mr. Stiles witnessed much that he describes. Each section is\r\nintroduced by an historical survey of the country where the events\r\ndescribed occurred. Thus Venice, Prague, and Vienna are brought before\r\nthe reader in all their past glory and recent political vicissitudes.\r\nThe Hungarian war is amply chronicled. The work is moderate in tone,\r\nauthentic, fresh, and abounding in interesting facts. It will be\r\nillustrated by engravings, executed in Germany, of the Emperor, Archduke\r\nJohn, Kossuth, and other chief characters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. A. K.

It is most\r\nconclusive upon the point of the unfitness of women for any of the more\r\ndelicate and important duties in obstetrics, and is a sufficient\r\nargument for the immediate abolition of the so-called \"Female Colleges.\"\r\nWe recommend it to the attention of readers who feel any interest in the\r\nsubject.--(Stringer & Townsend.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMrs. H.

It is needless to\r\npraise the great German, and it will readily be believed, by those who\r\nare acquainted with the fine abilities and thorough scholarship of Mrs.\r\nConant, that this translation is in all respects admirable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe are soon to have a new dramatic poem from Mr. GEORGE H.

We do not think any sonnets written in this country are to be\r\npreferred to Mr. Boker's, and his _Ballad of Sir John Franklin_,\r\npublished a few months ago in this magazine, is full of imagination, and\r\nis marked throughout with the nicest skill in execution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe last work of the late Professor STUART, a _Commentary on the Book of\r\nProverbs_, has been published by M.

No one among our\r\nyounger authors has risen more rapidly in the public regard, or\r\nestablished a good reputation in literature upon a surer basis.\r\nImagination, scholarship, and profound reflection, characterize nearly\r\nall his performances. The admirable story written by him for the present\r\nnumber of the _International_, we believe, is true in every essential\r\nbut the name of the heroine. It is a reminiscence of Mr. Kimball's\r\nstudent life in Paris, where, for a time, he walked the hospitals with\r\nhis friend, the well-known Dr. O. H. Partridge, now one of the most\r\ndistinguished physicians of Philadelphia, who is one of the dramatis\r\npersonae of _Emilie de Coigny_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. JOHN P.

The occasion was also\r\nimproved in Philadelphia by the Rev. Dr. BOARDMAN, who, in a discourse\r\nentitled _Washington or Kossuth_ (published by Lippincott, Grambo, &\r\nCo.), discusses the same great subjects in a masterly argument for the\r\nobservance of the principles of the Farewell Address.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn elaborate attack on the Society of Friends appeared lately in Dublin,\r\nand has been republished in Philadelphia, under the title of _Quakerism,\r\nor the Story of My Life_. It was written by a Mrs. GREER, the daughter\r\nof an eminently respectable Irish Quaker, who was herself connected with\r\nthe society for forty years, and so had abundant opportunities of\r\nbecoming familiar with the peculiarities of the system. But the book is\r\nvulgar, malignant, and evidently altogether undeserving of credit in\r\nregard to facts. The points obnoxious to ridicule are broadly\r\ncaricatured, and the most distinguished and blameless characters are\r\nintroduced in the most offensive manner, as if to gratify personal\r\nspleen or a disposition to slander.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Neander Library, recently purchased by the University of Rochester,\r\nconsists of 4,500 volumes, and the price paid was only $2,300. About 350\r\nof the volumes are large folios, and many of the works in the collection\r\nare of the choicest and rarest editions. We observe that an attempt to\r\nshow that there was even the slightest possible degree of unfairness on\r\nthe part of the Rochester faculty in obtaining this library, which was\r\nmuch desired by a western college, has most signally failed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe commend to our readers as the best literary journal in this country,\r\nthe _To Day_, recently established in Boston by CHARLES HALE, a\r\nthoroughly educated and judicious editor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Recent Deaths_\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM WARE was born at Hingham, in Massachusetts, on the third of\r\nAugust, 1797. He was a descendant in the fifth generation from Robert\r\nWare, one of the earliest settlers of the colony, who came from England\r\nabout the year 1644. His father was Henry Ware, D. D., many years\r\nhonorably distinguished by his connection with the Divinity School at\r\nCambridge, and the late Henry Ware, jr., D. D., was his elder brother.\r\nHis only living brother is Dr. John Ware, who also shares of the\r\nliterary tastes and talents of his family, and has written its history.\r\n\r\nWilliam Ware was graduated at Harvard University in 1816. After reading\r\ntheology the usual term he was on the 18th of December, 1821, settled\r\nover the Unitarian society of Chambers street, New-York, where he\r\nremained about sixteen years. He gave little to the press except a few\r\nsermons, and four numbers of a religious miscellany called _The\r\nUnitarian_, until near the close of this period, when he commenced the\r\npublication in the Knickerbocker Magazine of those brilliant papers\r\nwhich in the autumn of 1836 were given to the world under the title of\r\n_Zenobia, or the Fall of Palmyra, an Historical Romance_. Before the\r\ncompletion of this work he had resigned his pastoral office and removed\r\nto Brookline, near Boston. The romance of Zenobia is in the form of\r\nletters to Marcus Curtius, at Rome, from Lucius Manlius Piso, a senator,\r\nwho is supposed to have been led by circumstances of a private nature to\r\nvisit Palmyra toward the close of the third century, to have become\r\nacquainted with the queen and her court, to have seen the City of the\r\nDesert in its greatest magnificence, and to have witnessed its\r\ndestruction by the Emperor Aurelian. For the purposes of romantic\r\nfiction the subject is perhaps the finest that had not been appropriated\r\nin all ancient history; and the treatment of it, which is highly\r\npicturesque and dramatic throughout, shows that the author had been a\r\nsuccessful student of the institutions, manners and social life of the\r\nage he attempted to illustrate.\r\n\r\nMr. Ware's second romance, _Probus, or Rome in the Third Century_, was\r\npublished in the summer of 1838. It is a sort of sequel to the Zenobia,\r\nand is composed of letters purporting to be written by Piso from Rome to\r\nFausta, the daughter of Gracchus, one of the old Palmyrene ministers. In\r\nthe first work Piso meets with Probus, a Christian teacher, and is\r\npartially convinced of the truth of his doctrine; he is now a disciple,\r\nand a sharer of the persecutions which marked the last days of the reign\r\nof Aurelian. The characters in Probus are skilfully drawn and\r\ncontrasted, and with a deeper moral interest, from the frequent\r\ndiscussions of doctrine which it contains, the romance has the classical\r\nstyle and spirit which characterized its predecessor.\r\n\r\nMr. Ware's third work is entitled _Julian, or Scenes in Judea_, and was\r\npublished in 1841. The hero is a Roman, of Hebrew descent, who visits\r\nthe land of his ancestors, to gratify a liberal curiosity, during the\r\nlast days of the Saviour. Every thing connected with Palestine at this\r\nperiod is so familiar that the ground might seem to be sacred to History\r\nand Religion; but it has often been invaded by the romancer, and perhaps\r\nnever with more success than in the present instance. Although Julian\r\nhas less freshness than Zenobia, it has an air of truth and sincerity\r\nthat renders it scarcely less interesting.\r\n\r\nAbout the time of the publication of Julian, Mr. Ware was attacked with\r\nEpilepsy, while in his pulpit, at Lexington, near Boston, and he\r\nsuffered all the residue of his life from disease and apprehension; but\r\nhis illness did not affect his intelligence or its activity, and he\r\ncontinued to devote himself to congenial studies, for several years,\r\nchiefly as editor of _The Christian Examiner_. For a short period he was\r\npastor of the Unitarian society at West Cambridge, but the condition of\r\nhis health did not permit a regular discharge of his functions, for\r\nwhich, indeed, he was scarcely fitted in any thing but a spirit of\r\nhumility and piety. His tastes and capacities would have secured for him\r\ngreater triumphs in any department of pictorial or plastic art, to which\r\nhe was always insensibly drawn by instinct and congenial studies.\r\n\r\nIn 1848 Mr. Ware passed several months abroad, and after his return he\r\ndelivered in _Lectures on European Capitals_ the best fruits of his\r\ntravel. These Lectures have recently been published in a very attractive\r\nvolume, which has been favorably received in this country and in\r\nEngland. Among his unprinted writings is a series of Lectures on the\r\n_Life, Works, and Genius of Washington Allston_. He died on the 19th of\r\nFebruary.\r\n\r\nThe romances of Mr. Ware betray a familiarity with the civilization of\r\nthe ancients, and are written in a graceful, pure and brilliant style.\r\nIn our literature they are peculiar, and they will bear a favorable\r\ncomparison with the most celebrated historical romances relating to the\r\nsame scenes and periods which have been written abroad. They have passed\r\nthrough many editions in Great Britain, and have been translated into\r\nGerman and other languages of the continent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOHN FRAZEE, the sculptor, died at the age of sixty, on the--th of\r\nMarch, at the house of his daughter, in New Bedford, Massachusetts. The\r\n_Evening Post_ remarks that \"he was a man of decided talent for\r\nsculpture, but the necessity of employing himself in other occupations,\r\nprevented his attaining that skill which, under more auspicious\r\ncircumstances, would have been within his reach.\" Mr. Frazee was born in\r\nBrunswick, N.J., and in early life was a farmer and stone-cutter. One of\r\nhis first attempts at sculpture which attracted notice, was a clever\r\nfemale bust, a likeness of one of his own family, exhibited in the\r\ngallery of the Academy of Design. He afterwards, at the request of the\r\nbar of New-York, was employed in the mural tablet and bust of John\r\nWelles, which fills a conspicuous place in St Paul's Church. This\r\nproduction, with others subsequently executed, attracted the attention\r\nof the Trustees of the Boston Athenaeum, and at their request, in 1834,\r\nhe proceeded to Boston, and modelled a series of busts of eminent men in\r\nthat city--Webster, Bowditch, Prescott, Story, J. Lowell, and T. H.\r\nPerkins. Afterwards he went to Richmond, where he produced the likeness\r\nof John Marshall, copies of which adorn the Court rooms of New York,\r\nNew-Orleans, and the Capitol of Virginia. On his return he visited\r\nPresident Jackson, at whose house he executed an inimitable head of that\r\nextraordinary man. Among his other productions were heads of General\r\nLafayette, in 1824, De Witt Clinton, John Jay, Bishop Hobart, Dr.\r\nMilnor, Dr. Stearns, Nathaniel Prime, George Griswold, Eli Hart, &c. The\r\nmonument, however, which is destined to perpetuate his fame, is the New\r\nYork Custom-House. This edifice was commenced in 1834 by another\r\ngentleman, who, when he had finished the base, abandoned the work and\r\nwithdrew his plans. Mr. Frazee was obliged to commence _de novo_, and in\r\n1843 had completed the work. During the erection of the Custom-House,\r\nfrom the dampness of its material and concomitant causes, he contracted\r\na disorder which caused paralysis, from which he never recovered. For\r\nseveral years he held a subordinate post under the Collector. His last\r\neffort with the chisel was in giving the finishing touch to the bust of\r\nGeneral Jackson, which had remained in his studio seventeen years,\r\nwithout an order for completion. This was in November last, and while\r\nassiduously at work, his mallet fell from his hand, and his worn-out\r\nbody followed it to the floor.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOHN PARK, M. D., died in Worcester, Massachusetts, on the 2d of March,\r\naged seventy-eight. He was an active member of the old Federal party in\r\nMassachusetts, during the administration of Jefferson and Madison, and\r\nexerted a wide and important influence by his well-known journal, _The\r\nBoston Repertory_. At a subsequent period, he established a private\r\nschool for young women, which acquired a celebrity second to that of no\r\nsimilar educational institution in the old Commonwealth. He was\r\ndistinguished for his cultivated literary tastes, his uncommon purity of\r\ncharacter, his fine social qualities, and his cordial and attractive\r\nmanners. Dr. Park was the father of Mrs. L. G. Hall, wife of the Rev.\r\nDr. Hall, of Providence, the authoress of _Miriam_, and other successful\r\nproductions, and of Mr. John C. Park, an eminent lawyer in Boston. Mrs.\r\nOsgood and several other distinguished literary women were among his\r\npupils.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWILLIAM THOMPSON, of Belfast, the naturalist of Ireland, died in London\r\non the 17th February. Mr. Thompson was born in 1805, and from earliest\r\nyouth was attached to scientific and literary studies. For the last\r\nfifteen years his name has been before the world of science in\r\nconnection with arduous researches on the natural history of Ireland.\r\nThe numerous memoirs published by him, chiefly in scientific\r\nperiodicals, and latterly in the _Annals of Natural History_, of which\r\nhe was a warm supporter, extend in their subjects over all departments\r\nof zoology, and several are devoted to botanical investigations. He was\r\nconstantly on the watch for new facts bearing on the natural history of\r\nhis native island, which could boast of no more truly patriotic son. At\r\nthe meeting of the British Association, at Cork, he read an elaborate\r\nreport on the _Fauna of Ireland_, since published _in extenso_ in the\r\nAssociation _Transactions_; and it was his intention to communicate a\r\ncontinuation of that report at the Belfast meeting. He did not confine\r\nhis inquiries to Irish subjects, but added considerably to the natural\r\nhistory of several parts of England and Scotland; and when Professor\r\nForbes proceeded to the AEgean at the invitation of Captain Graves, Mr.\r\nThompson, himself an intimate friend of that distinguished officer,\r\naccompanied him, and devoted the short time he was in the Archipelago to\r\nzoological observations, since published, chiefly on the migration of\r\nbirds. His love of ornithology was intense, and the results of his\r\nlabors in that department are narrated with charming details in the\r\nvolumes that have been published of his great work on _The Natural\r\nHistory of Ireland_. His name is associated with many discoveries, and\r\nnumerous species of new creatures have been named after him. His\r\nreputation stood equally high on the Continent and in America, and he\r\nhad been elected an honorary member of several foreign societies. He\r\nnumbered among his intimate friends and correspondents all the eminent\r\nnaturalists of the day. His love of the fine arts was second only to his\r\nlove of science, and for many years he was one of the most active\r\npromoters of tasteful pursuits, especially of painting, in Ireland. He\r\nwas a gentleman of independent means, and of no profession.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nROBERT REINICK, deservedly the most popular of recent song writers in\r\nGermany, died at Dresden early in February. He was born at Dantzic, in\r\n1805, and was educated an artist, but he never painted more than one\r\npicture which attained any considerable reputation. His sketches were,\r\nhowever, remarkable for great delicacy of feeling, and of touch, a\r\ngenial humor and an endless variety of fancy. But it was his songs that\r\nfirst and most widely made him known to the public. Without any\r\nsurprising features of genius, they were so natural, so replete with\r\ntrue and happy sentiment, and flowed so sweetly and melodiously in a\r\nspontaneous beauty of language, that they were every where taken up, and\r\nstill remain the intimate favorites of the people, but especially of\r\nartists, to whose peculiar life and customs many of them are devoted.\r\nOne of the most pleasing books ever published in Germany, was his _Songs\r\nof a Painter_, which was illustrated with designs from all the prominent\r\nartists of Duesseldorf. Its appearance made an epoch in the book trade,\r\nand introduced the many splendid illustrated works that have succeeded\r\nit. It is some years since we read these songs, but their naivete,\r\ntenderness, and frolic humor are still fresh in our memory. Reinick also\r\nhad a great skill in the writing of story books for children, and\r\nillustrating them with his own drawings. One of these, the _Black Aunt_,\r\nhas been translated into English, and was published in this city some\r\nthree or four years since. The poet died quite suddenly, and was\r\nsnatched from a life full of happiness, amid constant artistic activity,\r\nand the love of his family, and a boundless circle of friends. All\r\nDresden sorrowed at his death, and his funeral procession seemed to\r\nembrace the entire city.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HENRY OXBERRY, comedian, was the son of the once eminent actor\r\nOxberry, and was born in Brownlow-street, Bloomsbury, on the 21st of\r\nApril, 1808. He was educated at Merchant Tailors' school; and\r\nsubsequently studied with an artist and in a lawyer's office. At length\r\nhe was apprenticed to a surgeon: and was asked by Sir Astley Cooper,\r\nduring an examination, whether, \"when he saw his father convulse the\r\naudience with laughter, he felt no ambition to tread in his shoes?\" No\r\ndoubt he did, for he soon after made his essay at the Rawstone-street\r\nprivate theatre, in the character of _Abel Day_, which he performed to\r\nthe _Captain Careless_ of Mr. F. Matthews. His public commencement was\r\ndeferred till the 17th March, 1825, for the Olympic, in the part of _Sam\r\nSwipes_, in \"The High Road to Marriage.\" He remained not long there, but\r\ntook a situation under Mr. Leigh Hunt, on the _Examiner_. Shortly\r\nafterwards he returned to the stage, and went on a provincial tour, and\r\nfinally appeared in 1832 at the Strand Theatre, as _Fathom_, in \"The\r\nHunchback.\" Since that period he was seen with credit in turn at every\r\ntheatre in the metropolis. On the 11th December, 1831, he married Ellen\r\nMalcombe Lancaster. He also became manager of the English Opera-House,\r\nbut was not successful. The loss of his wife was a misfortune, and his\r\nsubsequent career was not prosperous. He died on the 28th of February.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe REV. CHRISTOPHER ANDERSON, died at Edinburgh, on the 7th of\r\nFebruary, aged seventy. He was best known as the author of _Annals of\r\nthe English Bible and The History of Irish Literature_. He was educated\r\nat Bristol, at the college of which Dr. Ryland was president. He\r\nintended in early life to accompany Drs. Carey, Marshman, and Ward, to\r\nIndia, when the Baptist Societies' Mission was established in the east;\r\nbut being prevented by the state of his health he settled in Edinburgh,\r\nwhere he has for nearly half a century been the respected pastor of a\r\nBaptist church. In missionary work, both at home and abroad, he always\r\ntook deep and active interest. He travelled much through Ireland, and\r\nknew well the state of the people. His historical narration of the\r\nvarious attempts to educate the Irish in their own tongue is referred to\r\nby all who are engaged in Irish education and missions. He visited\r\nCopenhagen many years ago in order to obtain the protection of the\r\nDanish Government for the Serampore mission. The king granted him an\r\ninterview, received him cordially, and granted a charter of\r\nincorporation. It is from the Serampore press that the Scriptures first\r\nbegan to be issued in the languages of the east, and the names of Carey\r\nand the other superintendents of the Serampore mission are memorable in\r\nthe records of literature as well as of the church. He published in 1845\r\nthe _Annals of the English Bible_, an historical account of the\r\ndifferent English translations and editions of the Bible, a work of\r\nlearning and research, lately reprinted in New-York by the Carters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe mother of M. Thiers has expired at Batignolles, where she has long\r\nresided on a pension allowed her by her son. M. Thiers was the only\r\nchild of this woman, although his father had other children by a former\r\nmarriage, one of whom keeps a restaurant in Paris.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe some time expected death of THOMAS MOORE occurred on the 26th of\r\nFebruary, at Sloperton Cottage, near Devizes. Like Southey and Scott,\r\nthe British Anacreon had for several years before his decease, quite\r\nlost his intelligence, and he lingered in seclusion, and in half\r\nslumbering unconsciousness, personally well nigh forgotten by the world.\r\nHis history is little more than a history of his writings. He was\r\ndeservedly popular in society, for his amiable qualities, and\r\nfascinating manners; he shared the intimacy of the greatest men and\r\ngreatest writers of his age, more prolific of eminent characters than\r\nany other since that of Shakspeare, Raleigh, and Sidney; and dividing\r\nhis time between the quiet charms of domestic ease, and the smiles of\r\nthe most elevated classes, he may be said to have been a fortunate and\r\nhappy man. As a song writer, he was doubtless unrivalled. His\r\nversification is exquisitely finished, harmonious, and musically toned.\r\nThe sense is never obviously sacrificed to the sound; on the contrary,\r\nhe delighted in that species of antithetical and epigramatic turn, which\r\nis generally held to excuse some roughness, and to be scarcely\r\ncompatible with perfect melody of rhythm. In grace, both of thought and\r\ndiction, in easy, fluent wit, in melody, in brilliancy of fancy, in\r\nwarmth (but scarcely depth) of sentiment, and even in purity and\r\nsimplicity, when he chose to be pure and simple, no one has been\r\nsuperior to Moore; but in grandeur of conception, power of thought, and\r\nabove all, unity of purpose, and a high aim, he was singularly\r\ndeficient, and these are necessary to the character, not of a sweet\r\nminstrel, but of a great poet.\r\n\r\nThe London _Morning Chronicle_ furnishes a biography of Moore, which we\r\nslightly abridge. With him, says the _Chronicle_, is snapped the last\r\ntie, save perhaps one, represented by the veteran Rogers, which connects\r\nthe present generation with the outburst of \"all the talents\" which\r\nsignalized the opening of the century. That great kindling of\r\ngenius--embracing almost all sides of imaginative literature, of\r\ncriticism and philosophy--is becoming more a thing of history than of\r\nfact. Year by year, the lights are going out. Wordsworth was the last\r\nextinguished before Moore; and now, to all intents and purposes, the\r\ngreat galaxy which poured such a flood of light on the literature of\r\nfifty years ago--which extinguished Rosa Matilda fiction and Delia\r\nCruscan poetry--substituted true criticism for technical carping upon\r\nphilological points, and established new styles in every branch of the\r\n_belles-lettres_--this great constellation may now be said to have\r\ndisappeared. One of the brightest, if not of the largest stars, has long\r\nbeen obscured, and is now quite put out. The fame of Moore is fairly a\r\nmatter of discussion. It cannot, we believe, be denied that much of his\r\nserious and more ambitious verse, founded on promptings of a more\r\nluscious and florid fancy than the present tastes incline to admit, and\r\nno inconsiderable portion even of his lyric pieces,--refined to\r\nattenuation--are less read and admired than they were a score or thirty\r\nyears ago. A severer and sterner school of poetry has succeeded--one of\r\ndeeper feeling and more sober thought; and the representatives of those\r\nwho revelled in _Lalla Rookh_, and delighted in the strains of Mr.\r\nLittle, now generally address themselves to more staid and philosophic\r\nmusings. The _Irish Melodies_, too--exquisite as is their\r\nword-music--fanciful as is their conception--delightful as is their\r\nplayfulness, and touching as is their pathos--even the _Irish Melodies_,\r\nwe believe are declining in popular estimation. The reasons are obvious.\r\nIn the first place, the _Irish Melodies_ are not particularly Irish;\r\nthey have grace, sparkling fancy, delicious feeling; but they are too\r\nfine-spun to do the work-a-day duty of popular songs. As literary\r\nperformances, nine-tenths of Burns's are inferior to Moore's; and all\r\nDibdin's are immeasurably beneath them. Yet the probability is that\r\n_When Willie Brewed_, and _Poor Tom Bowling_, will be in the full tide\r\nof popularity, where _Rich and Rare_, and _Oh Breathe not His Name_,\r\nwill be unsung and forgotten. In a certain circle, and among people of a\r\ncertain reading and appreciation, Moore will live as long as the\r\nlanguage; but his genius was delicate and acute rather than catholic and\r\nstrong. He had a rich play of fancy, but none of the soaring imagination\r\nof Shelley or Byron. His mind, in fact, was a first-class second-rate.\r\nIt had no pretensions to stand in the line of the giants of his time.\r\nBrightly fanciful, rather than continuously imaginative--teeming with\r\npoetic imagery--loving to sparkle along the floweriest paths, and\r\nbeneath the balmiest skies--revelling always in fays and flowers--in\r\nlove, and mingled intellectual and sensual pleasures--playful in the\r\nextreme, and always ready to stop to make mirth as joyous and as\r\ndelightful as the passion--his muse, in his great romantic poems, is the\r\nincarnation of a charming Epicureanism; and the mirth and jolity could\r\ngo a long step further. He had wit, which sparkled as brightly as it\r\ncould cut deeply; and humor, and sense of the ludicrous, which could be\r\nas well, if not more effectually applied to living persons and actual\r\nthings than to the creations of his own fancy; and accordingly we find\r\nhim loving to turn from the etherealized voluptuousness of _Loves of the\r\nAngels_, or the mystic imaginings of the _Epicurean_, to the sharp and\r\nbrilliant hittings of political and social squibs--the restless satire\r\nwith which, in the _Fudge Family_ and hundreds of ephemeral but not the\r\nless clever lays, he quizzed his political and literary opponents,\r\nabolished the Earl of Mountcashell, or shot stinging shafts through the\r\nheart of the Benthamites. It is, indeed, far from probable that Moore's\r\npolitical and satiric poetry, little perhaps as he thought of it at the\r\ntime, will live after his more ambitious works have sunk into that\r\nchronic state of classicism, in which books are labelled with an\r\nexcellent character, and shelved--turned into the category of works\r\nwithout which no gentleman's library is complete, and doomed, not to\r\nactual obscurity, but to honorable retirement. The last of his political\r\nsquibs and short poems were given to the world in the columns of the\r\n_Morning Chronicle_; and referred principally to the earlier struggles\r\nof the Anti-Corn Law League--the verses having in most cases been\r\nsuggested by pasting political events.\r\n\r\nThomas Moore died at the ripe age of seventy-two. He was born on the\r\n28th of May, 1780, in Angier-street, Dublin, where his father, a strict\r\nRoman Catholic, carried on a grocery and spirit business. As a child, he\r\nis said to have been remarkable for personal beauty; but his appearance\r\nin after life hardly carried out the promise of infancy. He was short,\r\nwith a heavy, expressive, but not handsome face, which, however,\r\nlightened up wonderfully when conversing or singing his own ballads. He\r\nwas educated at Dublin, and one of big first noted peculiarities was a\r\nfondness and a talent for private theatricals. Taking advantage of the\r\nboon, as it was then considered, the young Roman Catholic was entered at\r\nTrinity College. He could not, of course, obtain a degree; but some\r\nEnglish verses tendered at an examination, in lieu of the usual Latin\r\ncomposition, procured a copy of the _Travels of Anacharsis_, as a\r\nreward. The wild times of the Irish rebellion were approaching, and the\r\npoet was naturally to be found in the ranks led by the Emmetts and\r\nArthur O'Connor; but his treasonable lucubrations, though, as his own\r\nsister remarked, \"rather strong,\" were passed over without any measures\r\nagainst the enthusiastic young champion of liberty. Politics, however,\r\nwere by no means the only subject of his muse. At the age of fourteen he\r\npublished poetry in a Dublin magazine, and afterwards composed many\r\nsemi-burlesque pieces for private representation.\r\n\r\nIn his twentieth year, giving up republicanism for ever, Moore came to\r\nLondon to study at the Middle Temple, and publish his translations, or\r\nrather paraphrases, of _Anacreon_. As may be imagined, he attended much\r\nmore to the Greek than to Coke upon Lyttleton, and permission, obtained\r\nthrough the friendship of Lord Moira, to dedicate the work to the Prince\r\nRegent, was the means of his introduction to those elevated circles in\r\nwhich he was afterwards to move and shine. His _Anacreon_ was highly\r\nsuccessful, and was succeeded, in 1801, by _Poems and Songs, by Thomas\r\nLittle_. Whatever objections may be raised by the present generation to\r\neither of these works, there can be no doubt of their vivid play of\r\nfancy, their singular grace, even when verging on improprieties, and\r\ntheir exquisite melody of versification. His translations of the _Old\r\nGreek Lover_, and of _Women and Wine_, are probably the finest and\r\nrichest versions of these often rendered songs in the English\r\nlanguage--always excepting the rough but thoroughly racy version of the\r\nlast, by quaint old Mr. Donne.\r\n\r\nIn the days of the regency, poets came in for patronage, and Mr. Moore,\r\nmade registrar to the Court of Admiralty at Bermuda--as singularly\r\nappropriate an appointment as some we have seen in our own day--went out\r\nto the islands, appointed a deputy, took a glance at the United States,\r\nand came home again. He then published _Sketches of Travel and Society\r\nbeyond the Atlantic_--a satiric work in heroic verse, vigorously\r\nwritten, but politically evincing a miserable short-sightedness. Soon\r\nafterwards, a savage review in the _Edinburgh_, of a republication of\r\n_Juvenile Songs, &c._, led to the celebrated rencontre between Moore and\r\nJeffrey, at Hampstead, when the great critic, as Byron asserted, stood\r\nvaliantly up:\r\n\r\n    \"When Little's leadless pistol met his eye\r\n    And Bow-street myrmidons stood laughing by.\"\r\n\r\nThe affair was ultimately arranged, mainly through the intervention of\r\nMr. Rogers, and at his house Moore shortly afterwards made his first\r\nacquaintance with Byron and Campbell. The long and affectionate intimacy\r\nbetween Moore and the author of _Childe Harold_, we need here only\r\nallude to. Moore had about this time married. His wife was a Miss Dyke,\r\na woman, of strong sense and character, as well as great beauty and\r\namiability. Their children are all dead.\r\n\r\nA couple of political satires of no great merit--one setting forth a\r\nsober and earnest panegyric upon ignorance--were followed by the famous\r\n_Two-penny Post Bag_, a bundle of rollicking satire and humor. It made a\r\ngreat hit. Not so its author's next venture, a farce called the _Blue\r\nStocking_, damned at the Lyceum. Moore's intimacy with Byron and Hunt\r\nwas broken off by the outspoken tone of the _Liberal_, and especially by\r\nthe _Vision of Judgment_. Moore thought his friends had gone too far.\r\nWhat would Carlton House say! For if, as Byron said, \"Little Tommy\r\ndearly loved a lord,\" with how much more affection did he worship a\r\nprince of the blood royal?\r\n\r\nThe _Melodies_ were his next, and perhaps most popular compositions.\r\nCharming as they are, and exquisitely finished as is their lyrical\r\nworkmanship, we doubt whether they have the stamina and heart-rooted\r\nearnestness, which are requisite to make songs immortal. Only the\r\nstrongest heart and the manliest brain produce offspring to suit all\r\ntastes and to last all time.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1812 that Moore determined to write an Indian poem. Mr. Perry,\r\nof the _Morning Chronicle_, accompanied the poet to the Messrs. Longman,\r\nand through his intervention the great sum of 3,000 guineas was settled\r\non as the price of a piece of which not one word was yet written. Moore\r\nthen retired to Mayfield Cottage, a desolate place in Derbyshire, and\r\nafter a long and hard struggle with a coquettish muse--after a three\r\nyears' retirement--he sent forth _Lalla Rookh_. Its success was immense;\r\nthe poem ran rapidly through several editions, and Moore's fame stood\r\nupon a higher and surer pedestal than ever. The tales were the triumph\r\nof poetic lusciousness; but not a few old judges stigmatized their taste\r\nby preferring Fadladeen and his criticisms, even to the Fireworshippers,\r\nor the tribulations of the Peri. We need hardly say that the judgment of\r\nthese tough critics has now a far greater number of adherents than it\r\nonce commanded.\r\n\r\nAfter a continental tour, Moore wrote the clever and popular _Fudge\r\nFamily_. In the following year he met Byron in Italy, and then the\r\nlatter intrusted to him his memoirs for publication. These memoirs Moore\r\nsold to Murray for two thousand guineas; but, as is well known and a\r\ngood deal regretted, the purchase money was refunded, and the papers\r\nregained, and destroyed. Pecuniary difficulties connected with the\r\nmisconduct of his Bermuda deputy, about this time, compelled Moore to\r\nseek a temporary refuge in Paris, and there he led a pleasant social\r\nlife, such as he loved, and composed the _Loves of the Angels_, which is\r\nnot much more than an elaborate and carefully wrought repetition of all\r\nhis previous love-and-flower poetry. The whole thing is dreamy, lulling,\r\nand beautiful, but vague and misty. The words tinkle like falling\r\nfountains, and the essence of the closing fancy floats about one like\r\nperfume; but this enervating species of composition is far from high or\r\ntrue poetry, and accordingly the work is now far oftener alluded to than\r\nit is read. In Paris he occupied the same hotel for a long time with his\r\nintimate friend Washington Irving.\r\n\r\nIn 1825 Moore paid a visit to Scott, who pronounced the Irish melodist\r\nthe \"prettiest warbler\" he had ever heard. One evening Scott and his\r\nguest visited the theatre at Edinburgh. Soon after their unmarked\r\nentrance, the attention of the audience, which had been engrossed by the\r\nDuchess of St. Albans, was directed towards the new comers; and,\r\naccording to a newspaper report, copied and published by Mr. Moore in\r\none of his last prefaces, considerable excitement ensued. \"Eh!\"\r\nexclaimed a man in the pit, \"eh, yon's Sir Walter, wi' Lockhart and his\r\nwife; and wha's the wee body wi' the pawkie een? Wow, but it's Tarn\r\nMoore, just.\" \"Scott, Scott! Moore, Moore!\" immediately resounded\r\nthrough the house. Scott would not rise; Moore did, and bowed several\r\ntimes, with his hand on his heart. Scott afterwards acknowledged the\r\nplaudits of his countrymen; and the orchestra, during the rest of the\r\nevening, played alternately Scotch and Irish airs.\r\n\r\nSoon after this period, Moore was established, by the kind offices of\r\nhis old and stanch friend the Marquis of Lansdowne, in Sloperton\r\nCottage, where he passed the remainder of his days, and where he ended\r\nthem. It was here that he commenced his career as a biographer, and\r\nproduced successively the memoirs of Lord Edward Fitzgerald, Lord Byron,\r\nand Sheridan. The two latter are well known and highly appreciated. It\r\nwas in the previous year that the poet first came out as a prose writer\r\nin the _Memoirs of Captain Rock_, a bitter and unfair account of--or\r\nrather commentary on--the English government of Ireland, and a curious\r\ninstance of warped and twisted views in a man of the world like Moore,\r\nalmost unavoidable in an Irishman writing of his country. His next\r\nserious work--he continued his squibs and sparkles of occasional\r\nverse--was the _Travels of an Irish Gentleman in Search of a\r\nReligion_--in which he attempted to show that the doctrines and\r\npractises of the Roman Catholic Church date from the apostolic period.\r\nThe last of his prose works, and that which has attained a greater sale,\r\nwe believe, than any of them, was the romance of _The Epicurean_. Here\r\nMoore's style, always too florid, is occasionally redeemed by passages\r\nof eloquence and natural feeling. There is much out-of-the-way learning\r\nin the book, but a pompous and cumbrous ornament overlays every thing.\r\nThe book had great success, but of what Mr. Carlyle calls the \"wind-bag\"\r\nnature. The wind inside was very highly perfumed, and sighed with very\r\npleasing murmurs, but it was only wind, and, as such, will ooze out\r\npresently, and the Epicurean bag will be little regarded.\r\n\r\nFrom this time political and social squibs were the only literary\r\noccupations to which Mr. Moore devoted himself until, gradually and\r\nfitfully mental darkness came down on him. Of critical estimates of\r\nMoore, we have seen none to which we more perfectly agree, than one\r\n(sometimes attributed to Richard H. Dana, but) written by Professor\r\nEdward T. Channing, for the _North American Review_ soon after that\r\nReview was established.\r\n\r\nThe best edition of Moore's works ever published in this country, is the\r\nvery beautiful one in octavo, from the press of the Appletons, embracing\r\nall the revisions, introductions, notes, &c., of the author's recent ten\r\nvolume edition, printed in London.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe well-known artist, SAMUEL PROUT, died in London on the 10th of\r\nFebruary. The _Athenaeum_ remarks that he was long and popularly known by\r\na style of Art which he may be said to have originated,--and to the\r\ninfluence of his example may be ascribed the distinctive character and\r\nthe successes of the English school of painters of architectural\r\nsubjects. Born at Plymouth about the year 1784, like his townsmen\r\ndistinguished in art, he owed little to the patronage of his native\r\ntown, unless their share in the praises which he ultimately commanded\r\nmay be counted to them as encouragement. In the metropolis his first\r\npatron, was Mr. Palser, the printseller, who used to take all his water\r\ncolor drawings at low prices, and had a ready sale for them. When Mr.\r\nProut had arrived at distinction, he never omitted grateful mention of\r\nthe advantages he had derived from the acquaintance and transactions.\r\nMr. Prout early gained the notice of the late Mr. Ackermann; and the\r\nmany drawing-books for learners, and other prints which he undertook for\r\nthat gentleman, soon gave currency to his name. His transcripts of\r\nGothic architecture at home it is superfluous to commend; and when the\r\nallied armies had made it safe to venture to the Continent, he was among\r\nthe earliest of the English to travel there. His love of the picturesque\r\nwas gratified amid the new and remarkable combinations of form which met\r\nhis eye at Nuernberg and in many of the adjacent cities. He was among the\r\nfirst English artists to add to what had been already made known of\r\nVenice by Canaletto. Nor must it be forgotten that he was among the\r\nfirst when Senefelder's newly discovered process was imported to try his\r\nhand at it. The powers of the art of Lithography, though its processes\r\nmay have been improved and amplified since,--were never better exhibited\r\nthan in Mr. Prout's broad and vigorous touch. The _Landscape Annual_ is\r\nanother record of his powers. Other books of the class testify to his\r\nunwearied industry and graphic skill. For many years suffering from\r\nill-health, Mr. Prout, in convalescent intervals, labored cheerfully at\r\nthe vocation which he had so illustrated in better times.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe venerable Dr. MURRAY, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, died at\r\nhis residence in that city on the 25th of February. The death of this\r\nexcellent prelate, whose life has been a model of Christian forbearance\r\nin a country where such an example is invaluable, the journals say is\r\ndeeply regretted by moderate men of all the religious denominations of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. M'NICHOLAS, titular Bishop of Achonry, died about the middle of\r\nFebruary. He was regarded as one of the ripest scholars among the Roman\r\nCatholic hierarchy of Ireland, and belonged to the advanced school of\r\n\"educationists.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe London papers announce the death of Mr. HOLCROFT, son of the more\r\nfamous Thomas Holcroft, the dramatist,--who was for many years connected\r\nwith the press, and, perhaps, in that capacity most prominently known as\r\nthe musical and dramatic critic of one of the leading daily papers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. BENCHOT, the editor of Voltaire's works, lately died at Paris. He\r\ndevoted thirty years to studies preparatory to the execution of his\r\nundertaking, which he finally completed in 1834. He also published in\r\n1811 a laborious work on French bibliography, which is still a standard\r\nmanual.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOHANN KOLLAR, Professor of Slavonian antitiquities at the University of\r\nVienna, died on January 24th, last, in his sixtieth year. He was born at\r\nMursotz, in Hungary, and was educated as a Protestant clergyman; he was\r\nappointed Professor in 1849. He contributed greatly to the intellectual\r\nmovement of recent years among the Austrian and Prussian Slavonians. His\r\nliterary reputation was first established by _Slavy dcera_ (The Daughter\r\nof Fame) a lyrical epic poem, published in 1824. His ideal end was the\r\ncreation of an independent Slavonic literature, which should preserve\r\nhis race from the ever increasing influence of German culture, by which\r\nhe foresaw that it must be absorbed, unless it could be aroused to a\r\ndevelopment strictly its own. During the Hungarian war he remained an\r\nadherent of the Austrian side. He leaves two nearly finished works; the\r\none is _Slavonic Italy in Early Times_; the other is upon Slavonic\r\nMythology, and is entitled _The Gods of Retra_. They are written in the\r\nBohemian or Tschechic language.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe widow of VON KOTZEBUE, the author of _The Stranger_ and _Pizarro_\r\n(the former of which still keeps possession of the German provincial\r\nstage), who was assassinated at Mannheim by the student Sand, died at\r\nHeidelberg, on the 4th of February, at the age of 73. She was Kotzebue's\r\nthird wife, and had lived for many years in strict retirement.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBARON KRUDENER, Russian Minister in Stockholm since 1844, died early in\r\nFebruary.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. LUCAS DE MONTIGNY, the adopted son of Mirabeau, died in Paris, early\r\nin February. On his death-bed Mirabeau took him in his arms, and called\r\non his friends to protect him. He left him all his papers and\r\ncorrespondence, and some years ago M. Lucas compiled from them eight\r\nvolumes of _Memoires Biographiques_ of _le grand homme_. He naturally\r\nentertained a profound veneration for the memory of his benefactor; and,\r\nit is said, spent not less than 100,000 francs ($20,000), of his private\r\nfortune, in buying up letters and documents calculated to cast dishonor\r\nupon it. These papers he of course destroyed, and it does not appear\r\nthat he left behind him any calculated to throw new light on the\r\ncharacter or career of the tribune.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBelgian journals announce the death of a M. SMITS, a great compiler of\r\nstatistics, and a poet: two vocations rather dissimilar. He wrote three\r\ntragedies, called _Marie de Bourgogne_, _Jeanne de Flandre_, _Elfrida,\r\nou la Vengeance_, which were applauded by his countrymen; also several\r\npoems on different subjects, and especially on the rising of the\r\nSpaniards and Greeks for liberty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDR.

Among the chief novelties we notice _La\r\nVivandiere_, which, with various styles of the _gilet_, or waist, has\r\nbeen introduced into New-York by Bulpin of Broadway. The waistcoat will\r\nremain in vogue. The Parisiennes, who had begun to turn it into\r\nridicule, still patronize it; and the provinciales need not fear to\r\nadopt it. But some conditions are necessary in order to render it\r\nbecoming and stylish. The figure of the wearer should be thin, tall, and\r\nsylph-like; all others should avoid the style. Rounded, white shoulders\r\nappear to much more advantage in toilette Pompadour than in toilet Louis\r\nXIII. The corsage Louis XIII., and the waistcoat accord so well together\r\nthat they are scarcely ever separated. However, some bodies a basquines\r\nare made to be worn without the waistcoat. They are then trimmed with\r\nvelvet or ribbon bands, which cross the chest and fasten with buttons;\r\nthe chemisette being composed of frills of English point or\r\nValenciennes, separated by embroidered insertion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INFANT'S STRAW BEDFORD HAT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BATEMAN CAP.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CLEMENTINE RIDING HAT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ST. NICHOLAS CAP.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOY'S STRAW BRUSSELS HAT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MISSES LEGHORN HATS.]\r\n\r\nThe recent fine bright weather has brought out many very elegant spring\r\nbonnets. The most fashionable are of Leghorn, which, during the\r\napproaching season, is likely to recover the favor it enjoyed some years\r\nago. The shape of new Leghorn bonnets is elegant and becoming--the brim\r\nis wide and circular, and the crown gently sloping backwards. The\r\n_bavolet_ at the back is made of the Leghorn itself, instead of being\r\ncomposed of silk or ribbon, as in bonnets of straw or other materials.\r\nThe favorite style of trimming Leghorns is with fancy straw, tastefully\r\nintermingled with velvet or ribbon, of some dark rick color. On one side\r\nmay be placed a small ostrich feather, of the color of the Leghorn, or\r\nshaded in the hues of the bird of Paradise. As the season advances,\r\nflowers will be employed for trimming these bonnets. Genin has\r\nintroduced a great variety of new and fanciful styles from the recent\r\nParis modes, for children, and for ladies' riding dresses. They are of\r\nLeghorn, felt, and beaver, all of which will be in vogue through April,\r\nand they are generally very tasteful and elegant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the above figure we have a _Promenade or Carriage Costume_, of rich\r\nfigured silk; the sleeves open at the ends, with under sleeves of white\r\nmuslin; with a Leghorn bonnet, trimmed with fancy straw and\r\nviolet-colored ribbon, tastefully intermingled; on one side a Leghorn\r\ncolored feather, waving spirally. Under-trimming, loops of narrow ribbon\r\nin various shades of violet; and gloves of pale yellow kid. The\r\n_taffetas d'Athenes_ is appropriate for ball dresses, and obtains\r\ngenerally; the ground is white, blue, or pale pink, brochees in silk of\r\nall colors in wreaths, or bouquets, forming undulating festoons round\r\nthe bottoms of the triple skirts. The upper skirt is flowered over in\r\nsmall designs to the waist, as is also the body and sleeves. The\r\n_taffetas flore_ has a white ground, covered with small bouquets of wild\r\nfield flowers. The _taffetas rose_ has wreaths of large roses, brochees\r\nin white silk round each skirt, and rose-buds over the top skirt and\r\nbody. This toilet should be accompanied with a coiffure, of a wreath of\r\nwhite roses, fixed behind by a bow and long floating ends of satin\r\nribbon, forming an elegant evening toilette for a bride. The manteaux,\r\nwith hoods, continue in fashion; they are generally made of cloth. The\r\nmantelet-echarpe has been cited for its elegance and taste. It is more\r\ndressy than the manteaux, marking the waist, and descending in front in\r\nsquare ends. Sorties de bal, are very fanciful. Some of white cachemire,\r\ntrimmed with beads, silk, and jet, with magnificent lace or deep fringe.\r\nOthers of white or pink satin, edged with ruches of guipure lace, or\r\nrouleaux of marabouts. They have hoods and large Venetian sleeves.",
