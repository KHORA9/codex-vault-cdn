will not include a definition of an\r\ninsect. Why should it? Everybody knows what he thinks an insect is, and\r\nthose who may be willing to have their ideas on such a fundamental\r\nsubject disturbed will rightly consult some work of greater authority\r\nthan this can pretend to. So instead of worrying myself, and others,\r\nabout what insects really are, or what are not really insects, as, for\r\ninstance, spiders, centipedes, scorpions, and the like, all which I\r\npropose to include in my tale—should they happen to present themselves—I\r\nshall confine myself to saying something about what some insects do, and\r\nI shall let one suggest and lead to the discussion of another, quite at\r\nhaphazard, and without any attempt at system or classification whatever.\r\nThis, in fact, is my own idea as to what is “the natural system,” and\r\nthe only trouble about it is knowing where to begin, because, as there\r\nare some 300,000 known insects,[1] and any one of them will do as well\r\nto start from as any other, there is a great _embarras de richesses_. In\r\nsuch cases the usual thing to do is to take either the head or the tail\r\nof the series—to commence with the _Hymenoptera_, which include the\r\nhighest and most intelligent forms, such as the ants and bees, or else\r\nwith the _Collembola_ or _Thysanura_, which are understood to contain\r\nthe lowest. I shall not adopt either of these methods. The _Neuroptera_,\r\nas far as I can make out (and if they don’t it doesn’t matter), stand\r\nsomewhere about the middle, and with them accordingly—as being between\r\nthe two extremes—I decide to break ground. Having done so, as I said\r\nbefore, I may go anywhere—absolute freedom will be mine. Like Plato, I\r\ncan follow the argument whithersoever it leads; inspired with which\r\nreflection I hasten to begin it.\r\n\r\nThough the order of neuropterous—which, by the way, means\r\nnerve-winged—insects does not contain any ants, yet the so-called white\r\nants or termites—which are very like ants in their ways, and almost, or\r\nquite, as interesting to talk about—are included in it. They are\r\ncommonest in tropical or, at any rate, very hot countries, such as\r\nAfrica, Australia, and South America, and here the conical, or\r\ndome-shaped structures, made of red earth, which they erect above the\r\nsurface of the ground, and which contain the greater part of the nest,\r\nare of such dimensions as to take a very prominent part in the features\r\nof the landscape. Often they are covered with vegetation, including\r\nbushes, or even small trees, on which, in Africa, antelopes are\r\naccustomed to browse. In Australia there is no reason, that I can see,\r\nwhy kangaroos should not, at least upon the grass which must often\r\nclothe them, and which is their staple of food.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHITE ANT HEAPS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    These great mounds are made by the white ants, and contain\r\n      their nests; but large and strong as they are, the ant-eater\r\n      breaks them down and devours the ants. A queen white ant is\r\n      shown at the right-hand corner with the extraordinary\r\n      development in which the eggs are carried.\r\n\r\nThese great mounds are pierced in every direction with innumerable\r\ngalleries, leading to and from the various cells and chambers in which\r\nthe domestic economy of the white ants is principally performed, one of\r\nwhich, known as the royal cell, contains the king and queen, and is\r\nsituated beneath all the others. Not all white ants, however—for there\r\nare several species—are governed or presided over in this way. Grassi,\r\nwho studied them in Sicily,[2] declares that the whole of the Termitidæ,\r\nwhether belonging to Southern Europe or the still hotter countries from\r\nwhich they have, no doubt, been unknowingly imported, fall into two\r\nprimary types. In the first of these the colony is presided over by a\r\nking and queen, representing the fully developed male and female forms,\r\nwhich have once, unlike the workers and soldiers—for, like ants, these\r\ninsects are divided into castes—possessed fully developed wings, which\r\nthey have subsequently got rid of in the same way that the queen ant\r\ndoes hers. In the second type the colony possesses several kings and\r\nqueens, but these, though they marry and produce offspring, are not\r\nperfect males and females, and never possess wings. They are, in fact,\r\nproduced artificially by the working termites, just as the hive-bees are\r\nable to make themselves a new queen—should they require one—by feeding\r\nan ordinary worker with royal jelly, and by a method somewhat similar\r\nthough not precisely the same, the royal substitutes being fed, not on\r\nany extraneous substance, but on a salivary fluid secreted by the\r\nworkers themselves—saliva, in fact. The colony, however, is, in this\r\ncase, not founded by the royalties thus bred up, but by a portion of a\r\npre-existent colony which, migrating from the parent nest, takes this\r\nmethod of augmenting its numbers.[3]\r\n\r\nIn the termite nest, as amongst ants, all members work for the good of\r\nall. The soldiers, which are furnished with large heads and long\r\nscythe-like jaws, take upon themselves the duties of attack and defence,\r\nthough in some species they only do so when the enemy is of a formidable\r\nnature, leaving unimportant foes to their less specialised companions.\r\nThese are equal to such inglorious tasks, but when the colony is invaded\r\nby hostile members of their own race, or by some fierce ant enemy, they\r\nretreat into the inner recesses, leaving the danger and honour to\r\nothers. Such an enemy is _Cremastogaster scutellaris_—or call him\r\nCremas—who, though never invaded by the white ants, enters their nest—or\r\ntermitary, to use the learned word—intent upon massacre. Under such\r\ncircumstances “the soldiers place themselves, with gaping mandibles,\r\nwaiting for any ant that may come within reach. They then snap their\r\njaws rapidly, shearing off antennæ and legs, tearing the abdomen, or\r\neven cutting the ants in two. The soldiers’ mandibles are seen to act\r\nlike extremely sharp shears.”[3] This should be somewhat discouraging\r\nfor the ants, and, indeed, they seem rather shy of the soldiers,\r\navoiding their heads, and “only daring occasionally to attempt to lop\r\noff their mandibles.” Their more considered method, which they adopt\r\nwhenever practicable, is to approach them from behind, and bite their\r\nabdomens, the soldiers, on their part, endeavouring to protect this\r\nvulnerable portion—and it is a fairly large one—of their anatomy by\r\ncreeping backwards under pieces of wood or stones, from which the head,\r\nwith its murderous jaws, is alone allowed to project.\r\n\r\nIn these encounters the advantage does not seem to lie so decidedly with\r\nthe ants as to explain their conduct in making the invasion, since\r\npeace, according to Professor Grassi’s observations, is usually\r\nconcluded “after about an hour’s conflict, with a certain number of\r\nkilled and wounded on both sides.”[3] As a result, however, it would\r\nappear that the ants often remain in possession of a portion of the\r\nnest, whilst the original occupants have to be contented with what\r\nremains. If this, therefore, is their object, the invaders have carried\r\nthe day, but if, as seems likely under natural conditions, they should\r\nprefer to return to their own home, they can hardly be said to have done\r\nso. Information seems wanting on these points.\r\n\r\nAs with ants, war is also waged between the various species of\r\nTermitidæ. _Termes lucifuga_, for instance—for where there is no English\r\nname there is nothing for it but to speak Latin—is, though much smaller,\r\na terrible enemy of _Calotermes_. The soldiers of the latter can,\r\nindeed, without much difficulty, cut their own in two, but their greater\r\nactivity is often more than a match for the superior strength of their\r\nopponents. The workers are more easily disposed of, but with these the\r\nsoldiers of _Calotermes_ do not often concern themselves. They are left\r\nto the nymphs[4] and larvæ, the equivalents, with the latter species, of\r\na true worker caste which has not yet been developed amongst them, as it\r\nhas with others of the family. When Professor Grassi placed a worker of\r\nTermes in one of his Calotermite tube-nests[5] it was at once placed\r\n_hors de combat_ by a nymph (somewhat a shrewish one) of the latter,\r\nwhich, rushing upon it, cut off a portion of its mouth. Other nymphs, as\r\nwell as several large larvæ, then hurried up and proceeded to further\r\nthe good work by severing the unfortunate creature’s legs, and tearing\r\nopen its abdomen. In all this the soldiers took no part until one,\r\ntowards the end of the struggle, advanced and added his single bite to\r\nthose which had been so plentifully bestowed. Similar observations were\r\nmade upon various other occasions, from which it appears plain that, as\r\nbefore remarked, the soldiers of this—very probably of all the\r\ntermites—are accustomed, purposely, to reserve their strength for foemen\r\nworthy of their steel.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the above account that termites differ from true\r\nants in one very important particular, namely, that they are as active\r\nand free-moving in the larval and pupal states as in the mature, or\r\nimago, one. “The termite society,” indeed, “consists, for the most part,\r\nof wingless sexually immature individuals, children potentially of both\r\nsexes, which do not grow up.”[6] Out of the majority of these the worker\r\ncaste, when it exists, is formed, whilst a much lesser number develop\r\ninto the large-headed, long-jawed soldiers. Both of these castes,\r\napparently, are produced independently of sex, that is to say, they are\r\npotentially either males or females, and not composed exclusively, as is\r\nthe case with ants and bees, of undeveloped females. Only the genuine\r\nking and queen of the termitary would seem to have attained the true\r\nimago state; such substitute royal forms as the workers, by feeding the\r\nlarvæ with saliva, are able to produce, retaining larval\r\ncharacteristics, though sexually mature—a phenomenon scientifically\r\nknown as _neoteinia_. As with the bees, these potential future royalties\r\nare bred up by the working termites to meet possible future emergencies.\r\nThey are never allowed to leave the nest, and, should any accident\r\nbefall the reigning king and queen, a pair of them are chosen to rule\r\nand produce offspring.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  The Concise Natural History, p. 551.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  In conjunction with Dr. Sandias, whose name must be understood as\r\n  accompanying Grassi’s—for the most part—when the latter is referred\r\n  to.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science, vols. 39 and 40.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  A nymph is the free-moving active equivalent of the chrysalis amongst\r\n  moths and butterflies.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  Nests built in chemical glass tubes and thus under close observation.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  Chambers’s Encyclopædia.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ant language—Stridulatory organs—How white ants\r\n      communicate—Conversation through convulsions—Nests\r\n      in tubes—Detection of a “crepitus”—Mutual\r\n      recognition—Cannibalistic propensities—Royal jealousy—Loyal\r\n      assassins—A kingly feast—Methods of feeding—Foundation of\r\n      colonies—Swarming habits.\r\n\r\nIT used to be supposed that such communication as ants are capable of\r\nholding with one another took place entirely, or almost entirely,\r\nthrough the mutual stroking of the antennæ, and Sir John Lubbock (now\r\nLord Avebury) was unable to satisfy himself, after numerous experiments,\r\nthat they could either hear or utter any sound. It is now known,\r\nhowever, that not only can some ants emit various sounds at their\r\npleasure—as, indeed, is sufficiently obvious in the case of one or two\r\nspecies—but also that they possess special structures enabling them to\r\ndo so, and the existence of which is inconceivable, except on the\r\nsupposition that they both hear and attach a meaning to the notes thus\r\nevolved. Thus at a meeting of the Entomological Society held in the year\r\n1893, Dr. David Sharp (author of the “Insects” portion of _The Cambridge\r\nNatural History_) declared that “examination revealed the existence in\r\nants of the most perfect stridulating or sound-producing organs yet\r\ndiscovered in insects, these being situated on the second and third\r\nsegments of the abdomen in certain species. The sounds produced were of\r\nthe greatest delicacy, and it appeared doubtful whether the microphone\r\nwould be able to assist the human ear in their detection”—which, indeed,\r\nit has not yet done.[7] Later, in the work above mentioned, Dr. Sharp\r\nremarks, “In many ants these parts”—that is to say the abdominal\r\nsegments—“bear highly developed stridulating organs, and the delicacy\r\nand perfection of the articulations allow the parts to be moved, either\r\nwith or without producing stridulation.”[8]\r\n\r\nAs these ant utterances are not sufficiently loud to be audible to our\r\nhuman ears, they must, I suppose, be inferred from the existence of the\r\norgans above-mentioned, and the way in which they work; but this is\r\nsurely sufficient data to go upon, since it is hardly possible for one\r\nhard substance to grate upon another silently. Forel, accordingly, as\r\nwell as Janet and other observers, now believe sound to be one of the\r\nprincipal means by which ants hold converse with each other, and it is\r\ninteresting to find that Grassi and Sandias have arrived at the same\r\nconclusion in regard to white ants, or termites. Their opinion, together\r\nwith the facts upon which it has been founded, is thus expressed:—\r\n\r\n“Several writers have mentioned the convulsive movements characteristic\r\nof Termites. These movements, or quiverings, are easily observed in\r\nCalotermes, and may be repeated periodically at very short intervals,\r\nalmost at the frequency of the pulse-rate. In the act of quivering, the\r\nlegs are held motionless, whilst the body is shaken forwards and\r\nbackwards. Sometimes a white ant may stop, whilst running, in order to\r\nquiver one or more times. Occasionally these convulsive movements are\r\nrepeated a few times only, and then stop altogether; but at other times\r\nthey recur after a few seconds’ or, at most, a few minutes’ rest, and\r\nmay thus be continued, sometimes, for hours, at regular or irregular\r\nintervals. In the intervals between successive convulsions the insect\r\nremains still, or progresses for a short distance only. These movements\r\nare executed by all members of the colony except the newly hatched ones.\r\nI have satisfied myself,” continues Professor Grassi, “by careful\r\nobservation of the phenomena exhibited in tube-nests, that these\r\nconvulsions serve as a cry to summon help or give alarm, or as a lament:\r\nin short as a mode of intercommunication.”[9]\r\n\r\nThe same observers then go on to tell us that if white ants are\r\ndisturbed in any sudden way, as by the too rough shaking of their nest,\r\nor by a light being suddenly flung upon it, or if otherwise annoyed,\r\n“all the members of the colony begin to quiver, except those that are\r\nrunning briskly about in search of a better situation.”[9] When dying,\r\ntoo, they will sometimes quiver in this way, at intervals of a few\r\nminutes, for as much as an hour or two, or even longer. Should an\r\nenemy—such as those we have been speaking of—be introduced of a sudden\r\ninto the nest, the less valiant members of it prefer to run away, but in\r\nthe midst of their retreat they may often be seen to stop and quiver\r\nwith unusual energy. Their object in these cases seems to be to raise a\r\ngeneral alarm, nor is it long before they are successful. Again, if\r\nwhilst one insect is burrowing into wood another outside should quiver\r\nin this way, the burrower quickly comes out, as though in response to\r\nsome signal of alarm. From all this it seems evident that these curious\r\nmovements must be accompanied by some sound, or sounds, inaudible to our\r\nhuman ears, and perhaps having a varied range, and with considerable\r\npower of modulation. To produce them, however, some stridulating or\r\nother organs would seem to be necessary, and of these, though they must,\r\nif there, be visible under the microscope, Professor Grassi says\r\nnothing. Possibly, however, sounds may be produced by the rubbing\r\ntogether of various parts of the body without any special apparatus\r\nhaving been developed, in which case the language, if we may call it so,\r\ncannot be so rich or copious.\r\n\r\nThe above remarks apply more especially to the larger of the two white\r\nants of Southern Europe. In regard to the smaller one, Professor Grassi\r\nmakes the following interesting remarks: “Termes makes the same\r\nconvulsive movements as does Calotermes, but the soldier of this species\r\nis able to produce a special creaking sound, which arises, whenever the\r\nhead is held horizontally, during the act of quivering, by friction\r\nbetween the back of the head and the front part of the thorax. But\r\nwhenever the head, during this act, is held in the usual position, which\r\nis not quite horizontal, no perceptible sound is produced, owing to the\r\nabsence of such friction. The soldiers of Termes, therefore, possess two\r\ndistinct modes of communication, whilst those of Calotermes have only\r\none, in which no perceptible sound is produced. This characteristic\r\n_crepitus_,” continues the Professor, “may be heard, at frequent\r\nintervals, by applying the ear to a tube containing a nest of Termites.\r\nThis proves that the quivering motions are a constant feature in\r\nundisturbed nests, so that they cannot be employed only as signals of\r\nalarm or distress. I conclude, therefore, that besides such special\r\nsignifications these convulsive movements must also have the value of\r\nordinary speech; that they constitute, in short, a means of\r\nintercommunication. The same conclusion holds good for Calotermes (the\r\none we have hitherto been talking about), and I imagine that the\r\nquivering of both species produces a sound which is perceptible to the\r\ninsects themselves, but inaudible to the human ear.”[9]\r\n\r\nMembers of the same ant community are known to recognise each other, and\r\nthis is no less the case with the white ants, or termites. Thus when a\r\nfew of the latter were removed from the termitary and returned to it\r\nafter five or six hours, the population showed no signs of alarm—not\r\nscurrying wildly about as they would have done had strangers been\r\nintroduced—but remained quiet and orderly. It was objected, however,\r\nthough I cannot see the force of such an objection, that the exiles, on\r\ntheir return, would have instantly recognised their old nest, and thus,\r\nknowing exactly where to go and what to do, they would have created no\r\ndisorder, and consequently roused no suspicion, amongst the other\r\nmembers of the colony. To meet this theory Professor Grassi provided one\r\nof his colonies with a new nest from which he excluded a certain number\r\nof individuals, so that when these were introduced into it, an hour or\r\ntwo after their companions had settled down in their fresh abode, it\r\nwas, of course, quite unfamiliar to them. In spite of this, however,\r\nthey caused no disturbance, but were clearly recognised as friends.\r\nWhen, however, a few strangers of the same species were introduced, they\r\ncreated great alarm amongst the rightful proprietors, who scattered in\r\nall directions. In a little while, however, all was again quiet, and as\r\nno fighting was observed, it would appear that, amongst the termites,\r\nstrangers from different nests soon become friendly with one another.\r\nThis, however, applies to the commoners only, it is not the same where\r\nroyalty is concerned. Thus when a second king and queen were introduced\r\ninto a termitary already provided with a pair, they were at once\r\nattacked by the subjects of the latter, who loyally bit off their legs.\r\nTwo days afterwards the reigning queen was herself seen to attack the\r\nmale pretender, or rather unfortunate victim of scientific curiosity.\r\nHe, however, though without legs to assist him, managed to drag himself\r\naway, but was afterwards found dead, with the outraged queen nibbling\r\nvindictively at his mutilated stumps. Next day the stranger queen was\r\nalso found dead, and the same thing always happened whenever the\r\nexperiment was repeated. Sometimes, indeed, the supernumerary royal\r\npair, or pairs, had disappeared altogether, from which it seems clear\r\nthat they must have been not only killed, but eaten.\r\n\r\nCannibalism, indeed, is rather an institution than a vice in the\r\ntermitary. To begin with, the cast skin of every member is eaten by the\r\nothers as a matter of course. With this view, any individual who is\r\nready to moult receives the skilled aid of two or more assistants, who\r\neither eat the outer portion of their friend, bit by bit, as they shred\r\nit off, or else carry it away whole and devour it at their leisure.\r\nSometimes, moreover, one, after licking another affectionately, in the\r\nway that ants do, may be seen to give it a covert bite, as though\r\ndesirous of something more filling, whilst any sick member is eaten by\r\nits companions before it is dead. Royalty is not exempt from this\r\ntreatment, and, on one occasion, nine individuals, including one\r\nsoldier, were observed by Professor Grassi in the act of enjoying a meal\r\non the body of a substitute king who was in process of moulting. The\r\nwretched animal was still alive, and writhed all over its body, to free\r\nitself from the torture. The nine assassins were probably annoyed at the\r\nlight, for they at once stopped eating, and jointly carried off the\r\nvictim to a darker part of the nest. Meanwhile many others crowded up to\r\npartake in this feast of royal flesh.[9]\r\n\r\nA soldier, too, has been observed to kill and partially eat one of its\r\nworker companions, nor is it altogether uncommon for an individual of\r\nany class, after licking, for some little while, the leg of another,\r\nsuddenly to snap it off. The bond of union, therefore, though\r\nsufficiently developed to allow of an elaborate social organisation, is\r\nnot so strong between members of the same termitary as it is in the case\r\nof ants, amongst which latter such unseemly conduct is never known to\r\noccur. So, too, unless a particular chemical substance, which seems to\r\nhave a maddening effect, be flung amongst them, ants of one community\r\nnever attack each other. Amongst white ants, however, warfare will\r\noccasionally break out within the nest, more especially if this be\r\ndisturbed, in which case the soldiers are apt to turn savagely on those\r\nnearest to them, perhaps considering them as the cause of the calamity.\r\nStill, upon the whole, order, and, if not friendship, at least\r\nco-operation, is conspicuously displayed, and the majority often\r\ninterfere to put a stop to such individual or partial combats as may\r\nfrom time to time break out.\r\n\r\nThere is more excuse for the soldier termites in their cannibalistic\r\npropensities, since owing to the special development of their jaws,\r\nwhich are long and slender, they are unable to triturate wood, which is\r\nthe basis of diet of these insects. They might die, therefore, but for\r\nsuch occasional lapses, were it not the common practice for all members\r\nof the community to feed one another, though the soldiers, for the above\r\nreason, are much more dependent on such aid. The food thus administered\r\nhas just been swallowed by the individual who parts with it. Such\r\ntransfer is performed in two ways, the first of which is familiar\r\nenough—that process, namely, known as regurgitation—but the second and\r\nmore staple one is too peculiar to be dealt with in a non-scientific\r\nwork. When a termite regurgitates, an exceedingly small round pellet of\r\nreddish-brown colour may be seen, by attentive observation, to form\r\nabout the mouth, and gradually to increase in size till it becomes\r\nplainly apparent, and is seen to consist of food—that is to say,\r\nwood—which has previously been swallowed, in a moistened and softened\r\ncondition. Sometimes this pellet is used for building purposes, but\r\noften another termite comes forward, receives, and swallows it.\r\n\r\nAnother article of diet which has a peculiar efficacy, and is used for a\r\ncertain purpose, has been already alluded to—viz. saliva. This, we are\r\ntold, “issues,” when required to do so, “as a colourless and distinctly\r\nalkaline liquid. It collects on the labium (the insect equivalent of\r\nlips) as a small drop, which may be employed either as a cement in\r\nbuilding or as food for others. These may either possess themselves of\r\nthe drop and then retreat a little way in order to swallow it gradually,\r\nor they may receive it from the one which secretes it and clearly\r\nprovides it for them as an article of diet. The assimilation of a drop\r\nrequires a certain number of acts of deglutition, which may be counted,\r\nand are usually four or five.”[9] Very young larvæ (the whole community,\r\nit must be remembered, are either in this or the pupal state) are fed\r\nafter this fashion, until sufficiently advanced to be able to swallow\r\nwood-meal. Under this course of diet the abdomen becomes remarkably\r\ntransparent, and this, in older individuals, is an indication that they\r\nare being bred up by the workers to become royal substitutes. The\r\ndevelopment, therefore, of termites from the larval to the perfect, or,\r\nat least, the sexually perfect form, seems to be wholly dependent on\r\ntheir being fed with this substance.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, the body of the queen termite, in the African and\r\nother tropical species, swells, when about to lay, to an enormous size,\r\nbut this is not nearly so noticeably the case with her European\r\nrepresentatives. Neither is a cell, in this case, constructed for her\r\naccommodation, but the royal pair, whether they are true king and queen,\r\nor only substitutes, “remain, in close proximity, in the heart of the\r\nnest, where the inmates are always most crowded.” They are not\r\nimprisoned, therefore; but can go from one place to another, should\r\nthey, as sometimes happens, wish to change their situation. In this they\r\nwould seem to be happier than their more specially accommodated royal\r\ncousins, but no doubt, with the latter, or at any rate with the queen,\r\nthe instinct of locomotion ceases with the capacity to indulge in it.\r\nThe purpose of the specially made cell is probably rather to guard than\r\nto restrain the queen.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the swarming of white ants—another habit in which we are\r\nreminded both of ants and bees—with the subsequent founding of a new\r\ncolony, Professor Grassi has the following remarks to make. They apply\r\nmore especially to the larger of the two European species, viz.\r\nCalotermes. “Before swarming,” he tells us, “they collect near one of\r\nthe exit-holes of the termitary, and when the proper time comes, issue\r\nfrom it in ones or twos, so that the twenty or thirty members who are\r\nready to take flight emerge in perhaps a quarter of an hour. Once\r\noutside, they run upwards, if the locality admits of it, for a few\r\nmetres, and then only do they take wing. In a room they fly towards the\r\nlight, and if a wind is blowing they follow its direction. Some,\r\nbecoming tired, settle soon upon trunks of trees, and all may do this\r\neventually. Here they group themselves into pairs, the males and females\r\nof which must frequently be derived from separate nests, since the sexes\r\nswarm separately; this acts as a safeguard by which Calotermes\r\nhabitually avoids in and in breeding. Matrimonial alliances having been\r\nthus formed, the work of excavation commences, each pair seeking for\r\nsome decayed spot in which to bury themselves and become, in time, the\r\nparents of a fresh community. The wings, by this time, have been got rid\r\nof. They may be shed by coming into contact with an obstacle, or by\r\ngetting damp and adhering to some spot, while the insect continues to\r\nmove. But, if not favoured by chance, the Calotermite purposely rids\r\nitself of these now useless encumbrances. Thus four perfect insects were\r\ncaptured after flying about the room, and put under a piece of rotten\r\nwood. Hardly had they settled when they stripped off their wings by\r\nresting the tips against some projecting corner of the wood, and then\r\nmoving backwards a little, so that the wings bent near the base, broke,\r\nand dropped off. When rid of them they began to gnaw the wood, at first\r\nalong and then across the grain. When they encountered each other by\r\nchance they first threatened to bite one another, and then ran off in\r\nopposite directions. This was because they were of the same sex. Had\r\nthey been of opposite ones, an attachment, under such circumstances,\r\nwould no doubt have been formed between them.”[9]\r\n\r\nThis is all the space which I can afford to these interesting insects.\r\nThere are many other points in connection with them which I might have\r\ntouched upon, but I thought it better to say less about what may be read\r\nby anyone in a score or so of works, and select as my text-book a series\r\nof the closest and most interesting observations, which lie buried in\r\nthe pages of a scientific journal not at all likely to meet the public\r\neye. Where possible, I shall be guided by the same or a similar\r\nprinciple throughout this small work.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  Nature, March 23rd, 1893.\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  The Cambridge Natural History, vol. 6, p. 134.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  Quarterly Journal of Microscopic Science, vols. 39 and 40.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ants and white ants—Guest insects—Ants’-nest beetles—Doubtful\r\n      relations—A strange forbearance—Yellow ants and white\r\n      wood-lice—Beetles fed by ants.\r\n\r\nFROM what has been said about the Termites in the last chapter, it is\r\nclear that they very much resemble ants in their habits, so that it is\r\nno wonder that they have long passed for ants in popular estimation.\r\nSuch a similarity is quite enough to justify one part of the name, as\r\nnames go; and as for the word white, which entomologists are always\r\ncomplaining about, that is quite near enough too, for though their\r\nbodies are not white, but yellow, yet the greater part of them—the soft\r\nfat abdomen, which particularly catches the eye—is of such a light\r\nyellow that it suggests white in contrast to the darker colouring of\r\nmost ants. Scientific men—unless their particular science is\r\nphilology—are dreadful pedants in regard to names, and always want to\r\nsubstitute their own manufactured ones, which have no real life in them,\r\nfor what has sprung up naturally on the lips of the people. Thus,\r\ninstead of hedge-sparrow—a name that explains itself to anyone who has\r\nseen the bird and knows something of its ways—ornithologists would have\r\nus say “hedge-accentor”—a preposterous concoction—and stormy petrel\r\nshould, according to them, be “storm-petrel,” because the bird itself\r\ncannot be stormy, whatever the sea may be. No imagination behind the\r\ncommon use of language, then. No poetic transference of attributes. All\r\nis to be as prosy as professors can make it, and “we must speak by the\r\ncard, or equivocation will undo us.” But names, which are a part of\r\nlanguage, come into being as language itself does—spontaneously, that is\r\nto say, and by a natural growth. They are right because they exist; and\r\nthe very errors contained in them—telling, as they do, of popular\r\nbeliefs and superstitions—are of greater and wider interest than the\r\nrectitudes of a few pedants. Could they play with substance as they can\r\nwith breath, these wise simpletons would first draw up a theory of\r\nanatomy, and then annul all bodies that did not conform to it. Such and\r\nsuch a word or name is wrong, in their eyes, though it exists quite as\r\nnaturally as any nerve or muscle, and is quite as tough though only made\r\nof air. This last they will find if they live long enough, and\r\n“hedge-sparrow” and “stormy petrel” will survive all their lifeless\r\nsubstitutions, though embalmed in many dull paragraphs of many dull\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nBut let us come back from words to things. Much as the white ants\r\nresemble real ones in many of their habits, the more remarkable ones\r\nthat distinguish the latter are not practised by them. They make no\r\nslaves and keep no domestic animals—at least I have never heard of their\r\ndoing so, though in natural history one must always be prepared for new\r\ndiscoveries. Many insects do, in fact, live with them in the termitary,\r\njust as others live in the formicaries of ants, and it is quite possible\r\nthat, when these have been better studied, some of them will be found to\r\nhave special relations—involving mutual intelligent action—with their\r\nlandlords.\r\n\r\nAt present, however, we seem to have little or no information on this\r\nhead. With ants it is different, and perhaps one of the most interesting\r\nchapters in their history is that which has to do with these\r\n_myrmecophilous_, or guest insects, as they are called.[10] Take, for\r\ninstance, the ants’-nest beetles, and especially one family—the\r\n_Paussidæ_—which numbers some 200 species, every one of which passes the\r\nwhole of its life, when not flying by night, within the nest of some\r\nspecies of ant. These beetles are small, as might be expected, the\r\nlargest being not more than half an inch in length, but present an\r\nextraordinary appearance owing to the antennæ ending in two broad\r\npalmated surfaces, like the horns of a moose deer, which project\r\noutwards, one on each side, at right angles with two short stalks,\r\nforming the only serviceable joints of these strangely modified feelers.\r\nAll the other ones (in some species, at any rate) have been fused and\r\nwelded together to form these flattened club-like structures, the use of\r\nwhich is not at first-sight apparent, and may not be fully understood.\r\nIf, however, a _paussus_ is laid on its back upon a flat surface, a\r\npredicament which would be as embarrassing to many beetles as it is to a\r\nturtle, one of their special functions is at once seen. Turning back the\r\ntwo clubs till they rest on the ground, and making the joint rigid, the\r\ninsect uses the one most conveniently placed as a lever, and soon gets\r\non to its legs again. Could we imagine that such an expedient would\r\noften need to be resorted to, the curious modification of the antennæ is\r\nat once explained; but it probably rarely happens that any small beetle\r\nfinds itself on its back in a place where there are no irregularities to\r\naid it in righting itself. Possibly, however, the smooth galleries or\r\nchambers of some of the larger ants might expose these _Myrmicophilæ_ to\r\nsuch a catastrophe, though, for my part, I suppose that the antennæ are\r\nused in some other special way which is of far more importance to their\r\nowners.\r\n\r\nThe relations existing between the ants and these curious beetles has\r\nnot yet been fully made out. It is true that the various species of\r\n_Paussidæ_ have upon some part of their bodies a smooth downy\r\nsubstance—a _pubescence_, to use the word dear to entomologists—which in\r\nother ants’-nest beetles is known to exude a sweet honey-like dew which\r\nthe ants, not unnaturally, are very fond of, and for which they\r\nassiduously lick them. As they have also been seen to lick their\r\n_Paussi_, we seem, here, to have at least the root of the matter, nor\r\ndoes the fact that, at other times, when perhaps these have ceased to\r\nsupply the attraction, they pay little attention to them, seem of much\r\nimportance, since we are all neglected when we have given what we have\r\nto give. But there are other circumstances not of so straightforward a\r\nnature. It has been lately discovered by a French observer—M.\r\nPéringuey—that these _Paussidæ_, welcome guests as they generally are,\r\nwill yet, sometimes, eat the larvæ of the ants with whom they live, when\r\nany small worker is engaged in carrying them from one place to another.\r\nThe ants resent this, and occasionally a large one, who feels himself\r\nequal to the undertaking, will attack and even kill a _Paussus_ that he\r\nsees behaving in such a manner. Yet, with all this, so valued are these\r\nbeetles by the ants that they often drag them back into their nests,\r\nwhen they have approached, or emerge from, the entrance. On such\r\noccasions, and also when the ants attack and even dismember them, the\r\n_Paussidæ_ make no sort of resistance. Yet they are extremely well able\r\nto do so, being armed with a weapon of tremendous efficiency, by which\r\nin a moment they could kill or stun a whole crowd of ants round about\r\nthem. For they are bombardier beetles, having the power at any moment of\r\ndischarging a fluid of a highly acrid nature, and so volatile that, on\r\ncoming in contact with the air, it explodes with a puff of blue smoke,\r\nexhaling at the same time a very pungent and unpleasant odour. When they\r\nare tickled with a straw, even, this bombardment at once takes place,\r\nand ants all round are seen to stagger or drop to the earth. Small\r\nworkers are killed, large ones retreat in confusion; yet the owner of\r\nthis deadly battery, which can only have been developed for the express\r\npurpose of overwhelming an enemy, will not, even to save life or limb,\r\ndischarge it against an ant—not one, at least, to whom it stands in\r\nthese somewhat doubtful relations.\r\n\r\nHow have these relations—whatever in their entirety they may be—come\r\nabout? My own idea is that these beetles, like some other\r\ncreatures—amongst them the little white wood-louse that lives with our\r\nown _Formica flava_—found ants’ nests very comfortable places of\r\nretirement, since, by reason of their peculiar weapon of defence, they\r\ncould defy any attempt to interfere with them, on the part of the ants.\r\nThe ants, on their side, would soon have given up molesting them, so\r\nthat, never requiring to defend themselves against the creatures by whom\r\nthey were surrounded, the intruders got to associate them with quite\r\nother ideas, and, having first lost the habit, at length lost the power\r\nof turning their artillery in this direction. Meanwhile _Paussus_, owing\r\nto its sweet secretion, which, after relations had once become amicable,\r\nthe ants would soon have discovered, had got to be a very welcome guest,\r\nso much so that, even when it took to eating their larvæ, they retained\r\ntheir love for it, as a species, though resenting such conduct upon the\r\nindividual. And now the once redoubtable invader could be punished with\r\nimpunity, for the habit of never discharging against an ant had become a\r\nfixed, inherited instinct, not to be got rid of even though life were at\r\nstake. Thus, as it appears to me, it may have come about that, though\r\narmed with dynamite, and carrying bombs, no living _Paussus_ has ever\r\ndefended itself against an ant, and no living ant, perhaps, ever seen a\r\n_Paussus_ discharge its artillery. Of course these are only conjectures,\r\nand the last, especially, may be opposed to fact, since it has been\r\nsuggested that one way in which _Paussus_ may make itself useful within\r\nthe nest of its hosts, may be by bombarding certain obnoxious parasites,\r\nor other would-be invaders. This does not, however, appear to me to be\r\nlikely, for how could these explosion take place, under such\r\ncircumstances, without doing damage to the ants themselves? In one’s own\r\nhouse one would hardly wish a bomb to be thrown, even against one’s\r\ngreatest enemy—at any rate not in the drawing-room. That the ants\r\nshould, by this means, be able, or, if able, willing to rid themselves\r\nof the mites which infest them, as has been conjectured, seems\r\nespecially unlikely—indeed, hardly possible. On the whole, it seems to\r\nme that the relations at present existing between the two insects could\r\nonly have grown up through _Paussus_ having ceased to discharge, not\r\nonly at an ant, but even—owing, probably, to there never being any\r\noccasion for it—in an ants’ nest. The experimental tickling with a straw\r\nwas, of course, an artificial stimulus. In spite of its sweet secretion,\r\nI cannot see how a beetle with such a power at its command as _Paussus_\r\nhas, can have been originally selected by the ants for domestication,\r\nbut, on the other hand, an armed invader might easily, by coincidence,\r\npossess some property which would make it, in time, of use and value to\r\nthe population on which it forced itself.\r\n\r\nAn example of an invader having no such merit, but harmless, and that\r\nhas become tolerated through necessity, is, in my opinion, the little\r\nwhite wood-louse before mentioned. It apparently has now lost the power\r\nof rolling itself into a ball, but when it first began to penetrate into\r\nthe galleries of _Formica flava_—our little yellow ant—it may very well\r\nhave had it, and this would have rendered it impervious to attack,\r\nwhilst its weight and round scaly surface would have made the task of\r\nremoving it almost an impossible one. Thus, perforce, it stayed where it\r\nwished to stay, penetrating, perhaps, deeper and deeper into the\r\nlabyrinth of galleries, as successive generations of cave animals have\r\nretreated farther and farther from the light of day, until at length,\r\nfinding the wherewithal to live, it became wholly subterranean in its\r\nhabits, lost the power of doing what it never required to do—namely, of\r\nrolling itself into a ball—and, through the absence of all sunlight,\r\nlost, too, its colouring matter, and became of its present dead,\r\nbleached white. Whether its eyesight, if it ever had any, is also gone,\r\nI do not know; but it can hardly, under present conditions, have any use\r\nfor it, whereas its antennæ are constantly moving, and seem to be of\r\nextreme delicacy. I could never observe—for I have kept nests of\r\n_Formica flava_—the smallest sign of any kind of relations between these\r\nwood-lice and their hosts; and if any scavenger work is done by the\r\nformer, from which the latter derive benefit, I believe that this is\r\nmerely incidental, and that the ants know nothing about it. But they\r\nhave got accustomed to the wood-lice being there, and put up with them\r\nbecause they cannot help it.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, in regard to _Paussidæ_, that the family is\r\nrepresented by some two hundred species, all of which pass the greater\r\npart of their lives with ants. In regard to this Mr. Kirby remarks: “The\r\nobservations made upon the family are so contradictory that the\r\ndiscrepancies can only be accounted for by supposing that different\r\nspecies have very different habits. Possibly some species may perform\r\nvarious useful services to the ants, while others are hostile; or they\r\nmay be so useful that the ants are willing to pay toll of a certain\r\nnumber of their offspring, in return.”[11]\r\n\r\nThis last, however, does not seem very well to accord with recorded\r\nobservations as to ants attacking any individual _Paussus_ whom they may\r\nchance to see devouring their larvæ, nor with the latter refusing to\r\nbombard, under these circumstances, even when in danger of their lives.\r\nIt is impossible to imagine a hostile _Paussus_ not bombarding, in such\r\na case, unless, indeed, we suppose it to have first lost its hostility,\r\nand then again to have become hostile, without, however, regaining the\r\npower of using its natural weapon. But this is a state of affairs hardly\r\nto be conceived.\r\n\r\nWe probably do not know the whole round of occupations which make up the\r\nlife by day, of the _Paussidæ_; of their life by night, we know nothing\r\nat all. The nefarious raids upon the larvæ or eggs (for both are\r\nappreciated) of the ants can hardly be of frequent occurrence, or the\r\npartnership, one would think, must come to an end. Other ant-guests,\r\nhowever, including sometimes smaller members of their own family, are\r\nlikewise preyed upon by these curious beetles, but very frequently, when\r\nobserved, they seem to be asleep, nor do they appear then to be taken\r\nmuch notice of by the ants. Where or under what conditions their eggs\r\nare hatched, or what is the larval and pupal history of each species, we\r\ndo not know, but only the perfect insect has as yet been found in any\r\nants’ nest.\r\n\r\nOther beetles that live with ants are either indifferent or hostile to\r\nthem, but others, again, are kept and tended in the same manner as are\r\nthe aphides, and for a similar purpose. All or most of these secrete\r\nsome sweet substance, which their hosts lick up, and, in return, offer\r\nthem an asylum from all enemies, and are ready to give them their\r\npersonal protection, should this be necessary. They go even further than\r\nthis, and actually feed them as they do their own larvæ, with honey, or\r\nsomething of a similar nature, which they regurgitate from their crops.\r\nOne little beetle—_Atemeles_ by name—is extremely fond of such a meal,\r\nand solicits it from the ants by stopping in front of them and assuming\r\na certain attitude, accompanied with insinuating motions of the antennæ.\r\nWhether _Atemeles_ is able to feed itself, or must live wholly upon\r\nthese ministrations, I am not quite sure; but another beetle—poor\r\n_Clavigertestaceus_—is, according to Janet, so entirely dependent upon\r\nthe ants for subsistence that, if separated from them, he has nothing to\r\ndo but to die.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  Others call them _inquilines_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  Kirby, Marvels of Ant Life, p. 100.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ant parasites—Fleet-footed brigands—Honey-stealing mites—A\r\n      strange table companion—Privileged cockroaches—Ants and\r\n      their riders—A fly-ride on beetle-back.\r\n\r\nLEAVING the beetles—though as there are probably some thousands that\r\nlive habitually in ants’ nests, we have said very little about them—we\r\nmay glance at an extraordinary little creature, in appearance something\r\nlike a wood-louse with a fish’s tail, that resides with certain ants on\r\nthe footing of a freebooter, constantly stealing from them, and eluding\r\ntheir resentment by extreme activity, living, as it were, in a state of\r\nperpetual motion. The legs of these persistent yet withal timid brigands\r\nare many and long, which, together with their shape and general\r\nlightness of build, enables them to run with great speed, so that they\r\neasily outdistance the ants, and, escaping to some less frequented part\r\nof the nest, with which they are always well acquainted, remain there\r\nquiet for a time. Should a single ant approach them, however, they\r\nimmediately run away, or, if forced by circumstances to be near one or\r\nmore—which, in an ants’ nest, must be often difficult to avoid—make a\r\npoint, apparently, of never keeping still, as though to confuse them,\r\nor, perhaps, to be the better able to dash off at any instant.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN INSECT FREEBOOTER, AND AN INSECT BEGGAR.]\r\n\r\n    The extraordinary looking insect shown towards the top is the\r\n      lepismid, or fleet-foot, who lives by stealing food from\r\n      ants when they are in the act of passing it from one to the\r\n      other. The atemeles beetle shown below is begging food,\r\n      which will not be refused, from the ant in front of him.\r\n\r\nThe way in which these fleet-foots secure their food is highly\r\nremarkable, each little theft—which has about it more of the parasite\r\nthan the brigand—occasioning a group of three. The ants upon which they\r\nlive are of the species known as _Lasius umbratus_, and, like many other\r\nkinds, often feed one another, the hungry asking of the full, by whom he\r\nis rarely, if ever, denied. In the process of regurgitation—with which\r\nwe are now familiar—the two stand fronting each other, with mandibles\r\ninterlocked, and a drop of honey passes from mouth to mouth. For an\r\ninstant it trembles between the two, resting on both, and that instant\r\nis the opportunity of the _Lepismid_. Darting forward, he interposes his\r\nown, and having absorbed some portion of the drop _in transitu_, speeds\r\nswiftly away to make a third elsewhere. Such a life, however great may\r\nbe the thief’s agility, is full of danger, and, from time to time, an\r\nindividual is captured and killed. In nests under observation such\r\nexecutions may be witnessed, and _Lepismid_ corpses—or, as various\r\nprofessors prefer calling them, _cadavers_—are sometimes noted. Under\r\nartificial conditions, however, opportunities of escape are much more\r\nlimited, unless, indeed, some special provision is made. Thus, when\r\nProfessor Wheeler first introduced a colony of _Lasius umbratus_ into\r\none of his _formicariums_, he found, after a couple of _dies_,[12] five\r\n_Lepismid cadavers_. But having, by the addition to the said\r\n_formicarium_ of a _refugium_, or asylum, made it more as _in natura_,\r\nthis mortality ceased, and the remaining _Lepismids_ continued\r\nhenceforth _existentes_.\r\n\r\nA similar mode of feeding, but under circumstances of much greater\r\nsecurity, is indulged in by _Antennophorus_, another ant-guest, whose\r\nrelations with its host are of a still closer description.\r\n_Antennophorus_ is a mite which, according to M. Janet, fixes itself on\r\nto the head, or the sides of the abdomen, of the ant which it affects,\r\nand clings there as long as it sees fit. This it is enabled to do owing\r\nto a special adaptation of the feet, which end in little horny cups\r\n(_cornicula_ is the word here) furnished with some substance of so\r\nadhesive a quality that it might well be called “stickphast,” if no\r\nLatin word were at hand. Not all the feet, however, are of this\r\ndescription, for the anterior ones are transformed into a pair of long\r\nwaving antennæ, which contain olfactory organs of the greatest\r\nsensibility. With these their owner makes up for the want of eyes, and,\r\nsmelling and feeling its way, walks, when it wishes to, along the bodies\r\nof its hosts, passing from one to another. Sometimes, either by accident\r\nor otherwise, it becomes detached, and is then helpless as far as\r\nlocomotion is concerned, but by no means so in other respects. Its\r\nobject, now, is to reaffix itself: nor is it long before it succeeds in\r\ndoing so. As it “lies upon the soil in one of the galleries of the nest\r\nit raises and stretches forward its first pair of ambulatory feet, and,\r\nat the same time, explores the space around it with its long antenniform\r\nones. These appendages are much more agitated when an ant passes close\r\nby. Should it pass near enough, the _Acarid_ (which has a finer sound\r\nthan ‘mite’) glues itself on to its body by means of the cup of sticky\r\nmaterial at the end of one of its ambulatory feet, which it holds up\r\nready for this operation, and it can, in this way, soon climb up and fix\r\nitself in a good position on its host. The latter is surprised, and\r\nseeks to rid itself of its strange companion, but failing in this, it\r\nbecomes resigned very quickly (as we do to increased taxation) as soon\r\nas the _Acarid_ has taken up one of its normal positions.”[13] It will\r\ncarry two indeed, or even three, without complaining. An ant with one of\r\nthese burdens fixed, like the income-tax, to the under side of its head,\r\nand two others, which may stand for a rise in tea and sugar, is a very\r\ncommon sight.\r\n\r\nThe feeding of _Antennophorus_ has been closely observed by M. Janet in\r\nhis artificial nests, and is thus described by him: “The ants had\r\nacquired a habit of placing themselves, crowded one against another, in\r\none corner of the nest, and thither came such as had their crops well\r\nfilled, after a meal of honey, and disgorged it before the mouths of\r\ntheir comrades who had none. While the fasting ant was eating the honey\r\nthus disgorged, _Antennophorus_, riding on its head, took its share. To\r\ndo this, it pushed itself forward, and thrust its rostrum into the\r\ndroplet, and generally, whilst holding itself in position by means of\r\nthe two hinder pairs of legs, it attached itself by means of the forward\r\npair (which in this case, however, would represent antennæ) to the head\r\nof the disgorging ant.”[13] Perhaps there is some little mistake\r\nhere—possibly I have not copied the passage correctly. There has been no\r\nhint before as to the modified antenniform legs of the parasite\r\nperforming any other office than that of feeling and smelling, whilst\r\nthe word “attach” or “affix” is that always used to describe the working\r\nof the sticky, cup-footed ones. In the position described the antennæ\r\nmight very well act as supports, but hardly, one would think, in such a\r\nway as that their owner could be described as attaching himself through\r\ntheir means. Possibly it is the first pair of true legs that act in this\r\nway, but the matter is of no great consequence—not more than a war, say,\r\nor the fall of a ministry, in the general run of things. Suffice it that\r\nwe have our picture, the little parasite stretched, like a bridge,\r\nbetween the heads of the feeding and disgorging ants, and taking its\r\nshare with the latter.\r\n\r\n_Lasius something_ is the name of the ant which _Antennophorus_ utilises\r\nin this way, and it is, I think, a European species. Another\r\none—_Pachycondyla harpax_—the large, black ant of America—wears its\r\nparasite round its neck, like an Elizabethan ruff. In this case both\r\nhost and guest are in the larval state, and the involuntary partnership\r\nbetween them—involuntary probably on the part of either—is not dissolved\r\nuntil both have attained full maturity. The position of affairs is this:\r\nthe ant larva apparently lies on its back upon earth a little hollowed,\r\nto receive it, by the workers of the nest. The parasitic larva—that of\r\nan unknown species of fly—has a long, slender neck, as we may call the\r\nanterior part of the body, and whilst this is wound about the\r\ncorresponding portion of its host, the body, which broadens out after\r\nthe manner of an oil-flask, is affixed by a disc at its end to some part\r\nof the back of the latter. When the ants feed the larvæ, they place the\r\nfood—which consists either of grain that has been stored, or of insects\r\ncaptured and torn up by them—on the broad surface of the abdomen, which\r\nforms a sort of trough for its reception. Immediately upon feeling the\r\nwelcome load, the hungry larva stretches down its head to the banquet,\r\nbut that of the parasite moves with it, and its small, sharp jaws take\r\neager toll of each dish. Thus the two feed together, cheek by jowl, and\r\nshould what has been provided prove insufficient for this double\r\nonslaught, the unbidden guest will stretch its snake-like neck, and move\r\nit ceaselessly until the ever-ready jaws come into contact with a second\r\nfeast, upon the table next it. Should none, however, be within reach,\r\nthe guest will give vent to its irritated feelings by biting the bodies\r\nof such unbounteous Timons, or even that of its own host. They wriggle\r\nwith pain, and this may possibly induce the ants to bring them fresh\r\nsupplies, under the impression that they are hungry, as indeed they may\r\nbe, with meals shared in this way. If so, we can hardly suppose a\r\nparasitic larva to act with such a motive, but as the best biters would\r\nin this case get the most food, natural selection may possibly have\r\nhelped to develop the habit, which would have a compensating advantage\r\nfor the wrigglers too. As the French say, “_Il y a compensation en\r\ntout._”\r\n\r\nThe parasite, whilst stretching out as far as it can from the body of\r\nits host, in quest of food, remains, all the while, attached to the\r\nlatter by the disc in which its body ends. It can, however, leave one\r\nant larva for another, though Professor Wheeler, to whom we owe this\r\ninteresting discovery, believes that it does this “with great\r\nreluctance, and only under urgent circumstances, such as extreme hunger,\r\nthe death of the larva to which it is attached, and perhaps, when fully\r\nmature, and about to pupate.”[14] So long, indeed, as its original host,\r\non whose body, when quite young, it was probably hatched from the egg,\r\ncontinues well and is well fed, it has no reason to seek farther, since\r\nall its wants are provided for. It is not only fed by the worker ants,\r\nbut shares in any other of the benefits which these may bestow upon the\r\nrising generation of the nest. Thus, if they move larvæ, as is\r\ncustomary, to give them change of temperature, and produce the requisite\r\nhygienic conditions, the parasite is moved along with them, and it is\r\ncleaned also—a still more important advantage possibly—at the same time\r\nas they are. At such times the ants never seem to notice the uncouth\r\nincubus upon the bodies of their infant sisters, though one would\r\nsuppose the difficulty would be not to do so. They are, it is true,\r\nblind, or nearly so, but it seems strange that their sense of touch,\r\nwhich is no doubt delicate, should not be able to inform them, since the\r\nparasite, though small enough, absolutely, is of great size regarded as\r\nan excrescence on its host’s body. This probably is the way in which the\r\nmatter presents itself to the ants, if they think about it at all, for\r\nsince the two lives are passed constantly together, and are subjected to\r\nthe same conditions, it is likely that they share one smell between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut this curious parasitic relation between ant and fly is not confined\r\nto the larval stage of each. Continued observation led to a further\r\ndiscovery which I give in Professor Wheeler’s own words: “As the days\r\npassed, the mature ant-larvæ spun their brown cocoons one by one, and\r\none by one the mature commensals (the larval parasites, that is to say)\r\ndisappeared. No traces of them could be discovered. The only remaining\r\nresource was to open the cocoons. Five were opened, and in two of recent\r\nformation commensals were found! Having shared the table of their host,\r\nthey had come to share its bed as well. The dipteron (the parasite, as I\r\nhave said, is a fly) had pupated after the manner of its kind, forming a\r\npuparium, that is, instead of spinning a cocoon like the ant larva: the\r\ndead larval skin, somewhat shrivelled and contracted, was used as an\r\nenvelope, and within this the pupa proper was found. In all cases the\r\npuparium was located in the caudal pole (at the bottom) of the ant\r\ncocoon, and was immovably stuck to the wall of the cocoon, its anterior\r\nend directed towards the cephalic pole”[14] (the top). But what, asks\r\nProfessor Wheeler, does the commensal larva do “while the ant-larva is\r\nweaving its cocoon? Does it move about to avoid the swaying jaws of the\r\nspinning larva? or does it take up its position, from the first, at the\r\nposterior end of the larval ant, and there remain motionless while the\r\nposterior pole of the cocoon is being completed? It is very difficult to\r\nanswer these questions.”[14]\r\n\r\nOne might think that young ants thus deprived, day by day, of a portion\r\nof every meal, would be stunted in their growth, and not make such large\r\nand healthy workers as those who had never been encumbered with a\r\nparasite. This, however, does not seem to be the case, and no difference\r\ncan be detected between the one and the other. Perhaps, therefore, ants\r\nhabitually eat, if not more than is good for them, at least more than\r\nthey require. This is the case almost universally amongst civilised men,\r\nat least in Northern Europe, and with savages to a still greater extent\r\nwhenever the wherewithal is at hand. In the above case we have, as\r\nProfessor Wheeler remarks, a very perfect example of what is termed\r\ncommensalism, in the original meaning of the word—that is to say, of two\r\nor more individuals dining together at the same table. As applied to\r\nnatural history, the individuals in question must be of different\r\nspecies, but it is not often that the definition otherwise is so\r\nrigorously adhered to.\r\n\r\nThis curious parasite inhabits the nests, or, more strictly speaking,\r\nthe bodies, of an ant, native to Texas, that has long been famous as a\r\nstorer of grain, but whose supposed still further achievements in an\r\nagricultural direction would now seem open to doubt. In the nest of\r\nanother American ant, which most certainly does grow mushrooms, the same\r\nobserver found another “_myrmecophile_,” or ants’ nest insect, viz. a\r\nminute species of cockroach that lives its life amongst the caves and\r\ngalleries of the great vegetable mass which forms, and is designed to\r\nform, the mushroom bed, upon the product of which it feeds. Here again\r\nthe ants have become thoroughly reconciled to the presence amongst them\r\nof a guest from which, as far as can be seen, they derive no benefit,\r\nwhilst having to submit to a loss, through its agency, of some part of\r\nthe fruits of their labours. These little cockroaches are fairly\r\nnumerous, and have become so adapted to living in darkness that their\r\neyes have almost disappeared. Another loss, or partial loss, is of a\r\nmore curious nature, and, one might think, would be a great privation to\r\nthem. Their antennæ, namely, are always incomplete, but this does not\r\nseem to have come about by a gradual process of atrophy, but rather to\r\nhave been caused by mutilation during their owners’ lifetime. But how\r\nhas this happened, and what has been the mutilating agency? Professor\r\nWheeler’s explanation, which he believes to be the only one, is that\r\ntheir antennæ have been unconsciously sheared off by the ants, whilst\r\nengaged either in clipping their mushrooms or in cutting up the pieces\r\nof leaves which they are continually bringing into the nest, to add to\r\nthe bed on which they grow. “It is easy,” he says, “to understand how an\r\ninsect like a cockroach, living in the midst of thousands of ants which\r\nare continually opening and closing their scissor-like mandibles, should\r\nbe certain, sooner or later, to have its long antennæ cropped. One\r\nwonders how the tarsi (the legs, that is to say) of the cockroach escape\r\nthe same treatment.”[15] This wonder, however, if there is really any\r\nreason for it, suggests a doubt as to the sufficiency of the explanation\r\nhere offered. The antennæ, one would think, might be held high, in which\r\ncase, if sheared at all, it could only be at the base, but if here (as\r\nwould not, however, seem to be the case) why should not the legs be\r\nsheared too? Again, it seems possible that the insects themselves may be\r\nin the habit of gnawing one another’s antennæ. As the cockroaches live\r\nand flourish it would seem that this mutilation of their antennæ, if\r\nthat, indeed, be the explanation, can do them no great injury. Yet these\r\norgans are supposed to be of great importance to insects, and, judging\r\nby their length and delicacy, one would think that they were especially\r\nso to the members of the cockroach family. In this case they would\r\nprobably be extremely careful of them, and the fact that these\r\nants’-nest cockroaches do not seem to be so, may show that subterranean\r\nconditions, contrary to what one might have expected, have affected\r\ntheir efficacy.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A RIDE ON BEETLE-BACK, AND A LIVING SWEET-SHOP.]\r\n\r\n    Enjoyment seems to be the only motive the fly has for riding\r\n      on the back of the African beetle shown in the upper part of\r\n      this illustration. Beneath is shown the well named honey-pot\r\n      ant with its distended body full of honey, which it gives\r\n      away to any hungry working ant.\r\n\r\nA diet of mushrooms, or fungus, is not the only thing for which these\r\nlittle blind, light-shunning cockroaches are indebted to their\r\nlandlords, the ants, for often one of them may be seen to mount upon one\r\nof the latter, and take a ride on its back. They seem especially fond of\r\nthe soldiers, as horses, and will sit perched on their enormous heads,\r\nas they walk up and down in a stately sort of way, sometimes for quite a\r\nlong time. Enjoyment seems here to be the only motive, and perhaps it is\r\na natural one, since there is a fly in Africa which seems to have quite\r\na passion for riding on the back of a beetle. “Across the mouth of the\r\nSeyhouse,” says the Rev. Mr. Eaton, “on sandy pasture-land bordering the\r\nseashore, big _coprophagous_ beetles—it sounds abusive, but no harm is\r\nmeant—are common, sheltering in large holes in the soil, when at rest,\r\nand running about on business. A small species of _Borborinæ_ (that is\r\nthe fly) may often be seen riding on their backs, chiefly on the\r\npronotum and about the bases of the elytra, sometimes half a dozen\r\nfemales on one beetle. The beetles occasionally throw themselves on\r\ntheir backs, and try to get rid of them by rolling; but the flies elude\r\nall their efforts to dislodge them, dodging out of harm’s way into the\r\njointures of the thorax, and darting from back to breast, and back\r\nagain, in a way that drives the beetle nearly mad. In vain she scrapes\r\nover them with her legs, in vain does she roll over, or delve down\r\namongst the roots of the herbage: the flies are as active as monkeys\r\n(not perhaps a very striking simile here), and there is no shaking them\r\noff. It is difficult (such is their strange predilection) to get them\r\noff into the killing-bottle. Nothing (not even the killing-bottle)\r\npersuades them to fly, and they would very much rather stick to the\r\nbeetle than——” what? Not go to heaven, but “be driven off it down the\r\ntube.”[16] The tube must be the neck of that same bottle. This, surely,\r\nis a case of infatuation if ever there was one. Eccentric fly! And what\r\nmust be the charms of a beetle that can prevail over those of cyanide of\r\npotassium! But the beetle, it must be remembered, is a _coprophagous_\r\none. There may be a world of explanation in a word like that.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  If _cadaver_ for corpse or carcase, why not _dies_ for day, which is\r\n  just as good English?

The fly, we may almost feel\r\ncertain, was endeavouring to lay its eggs, and the reason why she took\r\nso long about it was that she required a certain spot upon the beetle in\r\norder to do so, and that the beetle’s efforts, though appearing futile,\r\nwere more or less successful in guarding this spot. At any rate, if this\r\nwas not the case here, it is so in many other instances, various flies\r\nbeing parasitic on various other insects. Not all of these are fatal to\r\nthe object of their choice, which, if it affords them board as well as\r\nlodgings, may only do so to the extent of its blood. Such are the\r\ncurious family of _Hippoboscidæ_, or Bird Ticks, who begin life with\r\nwings, but are so little appreciative of the powers which these confer\r\nthat, having found the creature upon whom they elect to live, they bite\r\nthem off, or otherwise wilfully rid themselves of them, after the manner\r\nof ants and termites, thus offering yet another example in the insect\r\nworld of\r\n\r\n                        “one whose hand,\r\n                  Like the poor Indian, flung a pearl away\r\n                  Richer than all his tribe.”\r\n\r\nFor what can be imagined more glorious to possess, speaking of physical\r\nattributes, than the power of flight?\r\n\r\nThe course of life of these flies—if all be truth that is spoken of\r\nthem—is, indeed, very extraordinary, for during the first or winged\r\nstage of their adult life they live on birds, but migrate from them to\r\nsome quadruped—as, say, a deer—as soon as they find themselves within\r\neasy reach of it, and then, as having reached their final place of\r\nabode, do away with their wings. Thus, being too lazy or lethargic to\r\nfly themselves, they choose rather to stand indebted to another being\r\nfor a power which they no doubt once possessed in perfection, and which\r\nthey are still quite capable of exercising. What the larval stage of\r\nthese flies is, whether they lay their eggs upon their first or last\r\nhabitation—or on both, and if not, where or in what manner the larva\r\npasses its life, I do not know, and as my authority, who should be up to\r\ndate, holds his peace upon the matter, I conclude that it is not yet\r\nmade out. Possibly the grub is a vegetable feeder, or possibly, again,\r\nit is as fatal to some other insect as is that of a little fly with a\r\nbig name—_Apocephalus pergandei_ to wit—to ants. The victim here\r\nchosen—if there be not others also—is a black tree-climbing ant, common\r\nin Pennsylvania. As it runs over the ground or up and down the trunks of\r\ntrees, the fly darts after it on tiny wings, intent on laying her egg\r\nupon its neck. The ant tries to elude her endeavours, but\r\n_Apocephalus_—or Sit-o’-my-head—has a mission to fulfil, and will take\r\nno denial. The egg is laid, it cannot be detached, and, when hatched,\r\nthe issuing grub bores, with enthusiasm, into the head of the ant.\r\nComing to the brain he has nothing to do but to eat it, and he does so\r\nuntil the whole cavity of the skull has become an empty chamber, except\r\nfor his own presence there. The movements of the ant during this\r\nprocess—of its feelings we have no record—have become more and more\r\nerratic, and it feels itself less and less capable of performing its\r\nduties as a member of an active and industrious community. At length it\r\nfalls down, and not long afterwards its head falls off, giving to the\r\nmaggot inside it its first opportunity of looking out into the world\r\nthrough the window of the neck-hole. Hitherto its life, however easy and\r\npleasant, has been of a sedentary nature, but now it can enjoy the\r\npleasures of a walk, and moves about something after the manner of a\r\nsnail, dragging its cephalic shell behind it. But this active state is\r\nnot of long duration. The time of change is at hand, and snug within the\r\nant’s head and its own last larval skin, which, as is the way with fly\r\ncaterpillars, serves it in lieu of a cocoon, the fortunate little\r\ncreature turns into a chrysalis, and dreams away its time till, on some\r\nsunny day, it issues from its cradle a happy, active fly, feeling\r\nstrangely attracted by ants.\r\n\r\nAnother little fly belonging to this same family group—the hump-backed\r\nflies or _Pharidæ_—has it fate linked with that of bees, in whose hive\r\nit is hatched and on whose eggs and larvæ it feeds; nor does the grown\r\nbee itself, though armed with its sting, escape from the more rapacious\r\nmembers of the order. These are known by the name of Robber Flies,\r\nthough as the robbery involves the death of the victim, and consists of\r\nthe juices of its body, murder would seem to be the better word. These\r\nflies, though of somewhat slender build, which the better fits them for\r\ntheir swift and darting flight, are excessively strong, as might be\r\nexpected from their long muscular-looking legs and rough hairy bodies.\r\nAll sorts of insects are their prey, for the despatch of which they are\r\nfurnished with a hard tubular beak, enclosing, as in a sheath, a\r\nlancet-like instrument, which, being protruded at will, severely\r\nlacerates the body of the captive. The beak, or sheath, is also struck\r\nsome way into the wound, and being tipped with bristles, these serve as\r\nso many barbs to keep it in position, whilst the blade continues to\r\nprobe and hack the victim, on whose back the fly has descended,\r\nembracing it with its powerful legs. “These flies,” says Dr. Fitch—who\r\nseems strangely unalive to the moral beauty underlying the mere\r\nmechanical expression of it—“are inhuman murderers, they are savages of\r\nthe insect world, putting their captives to death with merciless\r\ncruelty. Their large eyes, divided into such a multitude of facets,\r\nprobably give them the most acute and accurate vision for espying and\r\nseizing their prey; and their long, stout legs, their bearded and\r\nbristly head, their whole aspect indicates them to be of a predatory and\r\nferocious character. Like the hawk, they swoop upon their prey, and\r\ngrasping it securely between their fore feet, they violently bear it\r\naway.”[17] Bees, beetles, butterflies, moths, even grasshoppers are thus\r\ntreated, and sometimes, by a beautiful retributive arrangement—enough to\r\nthrow one into ecstasies—they turn cannibals, and prey upon each other.\r\nNay, there is even more than this to arouse our admiration, for so stern\r\nand unbending is the law of eternal justice, that even the softest\r\nfeelings of nature are not allowed to interfere with it, and the female,\r\nwooed by the male, is frequently compelled to eat him. Thus the noble\r\nmaxim of _fiat justitia ruat cælum_, though, for a time, it may seem to\r\nbe in abeyance, finds, at last, unconscious expression, if not in the\r\nbreast, at least in the appetite of a cruel and murderous insect; and\r\nthus in the animal world, not less than in our human one, “the whirligig\r\nof time brings in his revenges.”\r\n\r\nTo bee-keepers—and to bees perhaps still more so—these terrible\r\nbuccaneer flies are especially obnoxious. Poised in air, in the\r\nneighbourhood of some hive, they watch the issuing and returning stream,\r\nand, making swift choice of a victim, sweep, like the wingéd furies that\r\nthey are, upon him. There is a sharp, shrilly sound, as the bee’s wings\r\nvibrate, for a moment, more rapidly, then the fatal legs wrap her round,\r\nand, pressed tightly to the oppressor’s body, she is borne to some shrub\r\nor flower, in the shade or pleasant fragrance of which the juices of her\r\nbody are sucked out, through a hole specially made to allow of their\r\npassage. When nothing remains but the empty shell, the fly drops this,\r\nand returns to the scene of its labours. Through all the hot sunny hours\r\nthese raids are continued, till hundreds of empty bee-shells strew the\r\nground. As the sun declines the sport flags and gradually ceases, but it\r\nbegins again the following morning as merrily as ever. America seems to\r\nbe the home _par excellence_ of these flies, but they are represented,\r\nunder various forms, in many parts of the world. The United States has\r\nbeen accorded its fair share of them, and according to their numbers,\r\neach season, the labours of the bee-farmer are rewarded or otherwise. So\r\nmuch is this the case that the fact that “during certain seasons, in a\r\nbee-raising district of New York, not a single hive threw off a\r\nswarm”[17] has been attributed to this cause alone.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BUCCANEER FLY, AND A LEAF-RESEMBLING INSECT.]\r\n\r\n    Poised in the air, the buccaneer fly selects its victim from\r\n      the bees issuing from a hive, pounces on it like a winged\r\n      fury, and kills its hapless prey. The insect depicted\r\n      beneath is protected from its enemies by its strange\r\n      resemblance to a dead leaf.\r\n\r\nIt would appear from these facts either that no bee ever succeeds in\r\nstinging its assailant, or else that the latter is proof against the\r\ninjection of poison. The former seems to me the most probable, since the\r\nsystem of the bee itself has no such immunity. It seems strange that so\r\ndeadly a weapon should fail thus constantly, at a pinch, and it would be\r\ninteresting to know if these redoubtable adversaries attack wasps as\r\nwell as bees. As it is not stated that they do so—as wasps are pointedly\r\nomitted from the list made out of their victims—the contrary may, I\r\nthink, be assumed, and also, as a corollary, that if wasps were attacked\r\nthey would be able to use their sting, probably with fatal effect. This\r\nsuperior capability is, no doubt, owing to the superior flexibility of a\r\nwasp’s abdomen over that of a bee; and if we ask ourselves what is the\r\ncause of this—how and for what reason the superiority has been\r\nacquired—the answer seems “as ready as a borrower’s cap,” viz. “as a\r\nmeans of self-defence through a process of natural selection.” Nothing\r\ncould be better adapted to bring this process into play than the very\r\nordeal through which the bee is passing; for if some could only succeed,\r\nthrough superior flexibility, in stinging the flies, they ought to\r\nincrease at the expense of those unable to do so. As far as it goes,\r\nthis seems to point to the wasp having gone through a longer course of\r\ndevelopment than the bee—to its ancestry dating farther back in time;\r\nbut when we think of the latter’s more elaborate social organisation and\r\nthe greater perfection of its cells, one feels inclined to reverse this\r\nopinion. As no bees possess such powers of twisting about and doubling\r\nround their abdomens as do wasps, though some can do so in a very fair\r\ndegree, it seems probable that the common ancestor of all the species\r\nwas more thickly built than that of the wasps, or at least that the\r\npotential capacity handed down by it of development in this direction\r\nwas less. But precisely the same argument may be used in regard to the\r\nbrain of the ancestral wasp, and thus we see that unless we have\r\ngeological evidence on the subject it is very difficult to say which of\r\ntwo species has the more ancient descent.\r\n\r\nThe Robber Flies—whose scientific name I have forgotten—however\r\ndisagreeable they may be, are at least not parasites. They attack their\r\nprey and kill it quickly, instead of handing it over to prolonged\r\ntorture at the hands of the next generation. This last is what the\r\nTachina flies—to say nothing of other kinds—do, who, as they principally\r\nattack caterpillars, may be considered beneficial to man. In the United\r\nStates of America there is no greater destroyer of all sorts of trees\r\nthan the so-called army-worm caterpillar, or rather grub—for it\r\nrepresents a fly merely—which gathers together in enormous numbers when\r\nabout to enter the pupal state. “I have seen,” says Mr. Leland Howard,\r\n“vast armies of the army-worm, comprising, unquestionably, millions of\r\nindividuals, and have been unable to find a single specimen which did\r\nnot bear the characteristic eggs of a Tachina fly. These flies were\r\npresent in such numbers that their buzzing as they flew over the army of\r\ncaterpillars could be heard at some distance, and the farmers were\r\nunnecessarily alarmed, since they conceived the idea that the flies were\r\nthe parents of the caterpillars, and were flying everywhere and laying\r\ntheir eggs in the grass and wheat. As a matter of fact, one great\r\noutbreak of the army-worm in northern Alabama in the early summer of\r\n1881 was completely frustrated by the Tachina flies, aided by a few\r\nother parasites and predatory insects. They also attack grasshoppers,\r\nbugs, beetles, saw-flies and saw-fly larvæ, humble bees, and wasps. (How\r\nthey avoid the sting of the latter we are not told; perhaps their\r\ninsignificant size is a protection.) The eggs are stuck by some sort of\r\ngummy substance to the surface of the preyed-on insect; and the small\r\nwhite eggs are frequently seen sticking to the back of some unfortunate\r\ncaterpillar. From the under side of each egg there hatches a little\r\nmaggot, which bores its way through the skin of the host, and penetrates\r\ninto its body, where it lives, nourishing itself upon the fatty matter\r\nand lymph until it reaches full growth, usually, if not always,\r\ndestroying before it emerges some vital organ, so as to cause the death\r\nof the host insect. It almost invariably issues, when full grown, from\r\nthe body of the insect attacked, and pupates, at or near the surface of\r\nthe ground, within the last larval skin, which hardens into a brown oval\r\npuparium.”[17] There are some points of special interest about the\r\nparasitism of these Tachina flies, which seem to be directed by a less\r\nperfect instinct than that which guides other insects of similar habits;\r\nfor instance, the Ichneumon flies, which, however, are such merely in\r\nname, being members of the order _Hymenoptera_, which includes the bees\r\nand ants.\r\n\r\nThese latter, by merely touching an insect with their antennæ, can tell\r\nif it is already occupied—in which case they withdraw—nor do they ever\r\nlay eggs in excess of the number of issuing larvæ that can be supported\r\nby the little world of provender into which they will be born. Neither\r\ndo they choose a caterpillar to lay on, which is just about to cast its\r\nskin, by which manœuvre the host would escape, and the guests be left to\r\nperish. All these mistakes, however, are frequently made by the Tachina\r\nfly, the consequence being that many poor children die of starvation;\r\nwhilst others, from wanting their necessary complement of food, have\r\ntheir growth checked and become poor pitiable objects, less than half\r\nthe size that, with a more generous diet, they would certainly have\r\nattained to. It is painful to know that such privation exists and to\r\nhave no means of relieving it; but nature is full of sadness, and it is\r\nbest to look truth in the face. Some comfort may perhaps be derived by\r\nlooking forward to a distant future, when the instinct which is now\r\nliable to these errors shall have been perfected. Such comfort, at any\r\nrate, lives in Mr. Leland Howard’s views that “the parasitic mode of\r\nlife in the Tachina fly is one of comparatively recent acquirement, and\r\nthat sufficient time has not elapsed since they began to take on this\r\nhabit”[17] to allow of its having reached the final goal towards which\r\nit is always advancing. It is difficult, however, to console oneself for\r\nthe imperfections of a work-a-day world in a far distant prospect of\r\nElysium.\r\n\r\nIn the somewhat numerous list of insects distinguished by the attentions\r\nof the Tachina fly, grasshoppers have been mentioned. In Africa they,\r\nor, at any rate, one species of the family, attack the terrible plague\r\nlocust, that has from time to time committed, and still apparently\r\ncommits, such terrible devastations. The latter seems quite aware of the\r\nfate in store for it, and makes vigorous efforts to evade its destiny.\r\nBuzzing in the air, above the ravenous horde, the fly waits for one to\r\nhop or rise on the wing, and then darts swiftly upon it. To avoid her,\r\nthe locust rises or sinks, tacks suddenly to right or left, scudding\r\nthis way and that like a ship to meet a varying breeze. The Tachina, in\r\nthe meanwhile, circles about her quarry, awaiting a favourable\r\nopportunity, which generally arises just as the locust alights, or is on\r\nthe point of alighting, when, descending upon it before the lost impetus\r\ncan be renewed, she clings lovingly, and deposits her eggs, either on\r\nthe neck or under one of the wings,\r\n\r\n                       “——and with a little pin\r\n             Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king.”\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, as a rule, till after the grub or grubs have made\r\ntheir exit from the body that the locust dies, though it has drooped and\r\nbecome languid for some time. Of the vast swarms that darken the sky and\r\ndescend upon the country, like a mantle, a very small proportion would\r\nseem to perish in this way, since everywhere the females may be seen\r\ndrilling with their abdomens into the ground, preparatory to laying\r\ntheir eggs. The check upon their numbers, whatever it may be—and on the\r\nwhole it must be very effective—supervenes, for the most part, at this\r\nearly stage, before the egg is hatched, that is to say.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  Leland O. Howard, The Insect Book.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\n    The burden of the locusts—Classical nonsense—Address\r\n      to Mahomet—Locusts in Europe—Succumb to the English\r\n      climate—Described by Darwin—Locusts in Africa—The wingless\r\n      host do greatest damage—Hoppers and jumpers—“An army on the\r\n      march.”\r\n\r\nLOCUSTS are insects famous in story, and when one reads about them in\r\nvarious entomological or other writings, one might imagine that the\r\nwhole world had been doing little else, ever since it began, than play a\r\nlosing match with these creatures. It is only after one has gone a\r\nlittle about the world, and lived for some time in regions noted as\r\ntheir head-quarters without seeing anything whatever of them, that one\r\nbegins to doubt this view, and lean towards another one, viz. that they\r\nare fabulous animals; but truth, as in other cases where two extreme\r\nviews are held, lies somewhere betwixt and between. The whole matter is\r\nthis, that when one reads one narrative after another, with its burden\r\nof a darkened sun, devastated territories, strong winds, drownings in\r\nthe sea, and pestilences engendered by innumerable carcases cast up\r\nalong hundreds of miles of beach, the intervals, as well as the\r\ncountries, between each one of these occurrences, are annihilated in the\r\nimagination, and the dates, if seen, are forgotten. Thus, to use the\r\nKaffir expression—which has not yet lost its meaning for a civilised\r\nEuropean—one sees everything red; locusts are very convincing—“you may\r\nalmost hear the beating of their wings.”\r\n\r\nHowever, there is no doubt that these insects, in relation to man, have\r\nplayed what the Germans call “_eine bedeutende Rolle_” in the world, and\r\nare worth saying something about, if only one has something not too\r\ndesperately antique to say, and this, by virtue of a work which I, at\r\nany rate, have never seen quoted, and a paper in a certain Antipodean\r\norgan, which for the majority of people here might as well be in the\r\n_Faerie Queene_ or _Paradise Lost_, I think I may have. But first let us\r\nturn to what, though it be antique, is also classical, and—though this\r\nwould not be a corollary for everyone—very delightful: “To look,” say\r\nthe authors of the famous _Introduction_, “at a locust in a cabinet of\r\ninsects, you would not, at first sight, deem it capable of being the\r\nsource of so much evil to mankind as stands on record against it. ‘This\r\nis but a small creature,’ you would say, ‘and the mischief which it\r\ncauses cannot be far beyond the proportion of its bulk. The locusts so\r\ncelebrated in history must surely be of the Indian kind mentioned by\r\nPliny, which were three feet in length, with legs so strong that the\r\nwomen used them as saws. I see, indeed, some resemblance to the horse’s\r\nhead, but where are the eyes of the elephant, the neck of the bull, the\r\nhorns of the stag, the chest of the lion, the belly of the scorpion, the\r\nwings of the eagle, the thighs of the camel, the legs of the ostrich,\r\nand the tail of the serpent, all of which the Arabians mention as\r\nattributes of this widely dreaded insect destroyer, but of which, in the\r\ninsect before me, I discern little or no likeness?’” Personally, I do\r\nnot for a moment imagine that even in 1815, the date of the first\r\nedition of the work in question, any reasonably educated person would\r\nhave spoken or thought in this way, without any conception, apparently,\r\nof what numbers can effect, but it is interesting to know what the Arabs\r\nthink, or say, about the locust, and especially that they represent\r\nit—as we are told a few lines on—as thus addressing Mahomet: “We are the\r\narmy of the Great God; we produce ninety-nine eggs; if the hundred were\r\ncompleted, we should consume the whole earth and all that is in it.”\r\n\r\nThe authors then proceed to give a short résumé of the various locust\r\nplagues under which the earth, over a large part of its surface, has at\r\ndifferent times groaned. The first and best authenticated goes back to a\r\nvery early period—about 4000 B.C.—after which the evidence does not\r\nconform quite so strictly to the test demanded of it by the modern\r\nscientific spirit. Pliny, however, we are told, “mentions a law in\r\nCyrenaica by which the inhabitants were enjoined to destroy the locusts\r\nin three different states, three times in the year—first their eggs,\r\nthen their young, and lastly the perfect insect. And not without reason\r\nwas such a law enacted; for Orosius tells us that in the year of the\r\nworld 3800 Africa was infested by such infinite myriads of these animals\r\nthat having devoured every green thing, after flying off to sea they\r\nwere drowned, and being cast upon the shore, they emitted a stench\r\ngreater than could have been produced by the carcases of 100,000 men (a\r\nvery confident statement, surely). St. Augustine also mentions a plague\r\nas having arisen in that country from the same cause, which destroyed no\r\nless than 800,000 persons (_octingenta_ _hominum millia_) in the kingdom\r\nof Masanissa alone, and many more in the territories bordering upon the\r\nsea.” After this we make a jump to A.D. 591, and find the locusts in\r\nEurope. In that year “an infinite army of them, of a size unusually\r\nlarge, grievously ravaged part of Italy; and, being at last cast into\r\nthe sea, from their stench arose a pestilence which carried off near a\r\nmillion of men and beasts. In the Venetian territory also, in 1478, more\r\nthan 30,000 persons” (but this seems pitiful) “are said to have perished\r\nin a famine occasioned by these terrific scourges.”\r\n\r\nMany other instances of their devastations in Europe, in France, Spain,\r\nItaly, Germany, etc., are recorded by the same authors. “In 1650 a cloud\r\nof them was seen to enter Russia in three different places, which from\r\nthence passed over into Poland and Lithuania, where the air was darkened\r\nby their numbers. In some places they were seen lying dead, heaped one\r\nupon another to the depth of four feet; in others they covered the\r\nsurface, like a black cloth, the trees bent with their weight, and the\r\ndamage they did exceeded all computation.” Nay, “even this happy island\r\n(_lucus a non lucendo_), so remarkably distinguished by its exemption\r\nfrom most of those scourges to which other nations are exposed (as fog,\r\nsunshine, etc.), was once alarmed by the appearance of locusts. In 1748\r\nthey were observed here in considerable numbers, but providentially they\r\nsoon perished without propagating”—the “happy island” apparently having\r\nbeen too much for them. These unfortunates would appear to have been\r\nstragglers from far vaster numbers which a year before had devastated\r\nEastern Europe, one swarm of which, “entering Transylvania in August,\r\nwas several hundred fathoms in width. At Vienna the breadth of one of\r\nthem was three miles, and extended to so great a length as to be four\r\nhours in passing over the Red Tower: and such was its density that it\r\ntotally intercepted the solar light, so that when they flew low one\r\nperson could not see another at the distance of twenty paces.” Another\r\nhost that appeared in India is said to have formed a column five hundred\r\nmiles long, and “so compact was it when on the wing that, like an\r\neclipse, it completely hid the sun, so that no shadow was cast by any\r\nobject, and some lofty tombs not more than 200 yards off were rendered\r\nquite invisible.”\r\n\r\nDr. Clarke in his _Travels_ speaks of locusts covering “his carriage and\r\nhorses, and says the Tartars assert that people are sometimes suffocated\r\nby them.” He mentions two species, “the first of which is almost twice\r\nthe size of the second, and, because it precedes it, is called by the\r\nTartars the herald or messenger.” From 1778 to 1780 a dreadful curse of\r\nlocusts, alluded to by Southey in his “Thalaba”—or, perhaps, forming the\r\nsubject of that poem—I really don’t know—fell upon the Empire of\r\nMorocco. “Everything green was eaten up, not even the bitter bark of the\r\norange and pomegranate escaping. A most dreadful famine ensued. The poor\r\nwere seen to wander over the country deriving a miserable subsistence\r\nfrom the roots of plants; and women and children followed the camels,\r\nfrom whose dung they picked the undigested grains of barley, which they\r\ndevoured with avidity; in consequence of which numbers perished, and the\r\nroads and streets exhibited the unburied carcases of the dead.” Again,\r\n“From Mogador to Tangier, before the plague of 1799, the face of the\r\nearth was covered by them. At that time a singular incident occurred at\r\nEl Araiche. The whole region from the confines of the Sahara was ravaged\r\nby them; but on the other side of the river, El Kos, not one was to be\r\nseen, though there was nothing to prevent their flying over it. Till\r\nthen they had proceeded northwards; but upon arriving at its banks they\r\nturned to the east, so that all the country north of El Araiche was full\r\nof pulse, fruits, and grain—exhibiting a most striking contrast to the\r\ndesolation of the adjoining district.” Lastly—that is to say, to make a\r\nlast quotation from the classics—“The Arabs of the Desert, whose hands\r\nare against every man, and who rejoice in the evil that befalls other\r\nnations, when they behold the clouds of locusts proceeding from the\r\nnorth, are filled with gladness, anticipating a general mortality, which\r\nthey call _El Khere_ (the benediction), for when a country is thus laid\r\nwaste they emerge from their arid deserts and pitch their tents in the\r\ndesolated plains.”\r\n\r\nDarwin, in his _Journal of Researches_, gives the following account of a\r\nflight of locusts: “Shortly before we arrived at the village of Luxan we\r\nobserved to the south a ragged cloud of a dark reddish-brown colour. At\r\nfirst we thought that it was smoke from some great fire on the plains;\r\nbut we soon found that it was a swarm of locusts. They were flying\r\nnorthward, and with the aid of a slight breeze they overtook us at a\r\nrate of ten or fifteen miles an hour. The main body filled the air from\r\na height of twenty feet to that, as it appeared, of two or three\r\nthousand above the ground; ‘and the sound of their wings was as the\r\nsound of chariots of many horses running to battle,’ or rather, I should\r\nsay, like a strong breeze passing through the rigging of a ship. The\r\nsky, seen through the advanced guard, appeared like a mezzotinto\r\nengraving, but the main body was impervious to sight; they were not,\r\nhowever, so thick together but that they could escape a stick waved\r\nbackwards and forwards. When they alighted, they were more numerous than\r\nthe leaves in the field, and the surface became reddish instead of being\r\ngreen: the swarm having once alighted, the individuals flew from side to\r\nside in all directions.” At that time—the year was 1835—locusts were\r\n“not an uncommon pest in this country: already during this season\r\nseveral smaller swarms had come up from the south, where, as,\r\napparently, in all other parts of the world, they are bred in the\r\ndeserts. The poor cottagers in vain attempted by lighting fires, by\r\nshouts, and by waving branches to avert the attack.” This locust, Darwin\r\ntells us, closely resembled the famous _Gryllus migratorius_ of the\r\nEast—the one that spoke to the Prophet—if, indeed, it was not identical\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nThough these accounts are all interesting in their way, they none of\r\nthem tell us much—or, indeed, anything—about the locusts themselves, for\r\nwhich reason I will supplement them with some which have that advantage,\r\nand are also, in some sort, a check or commentary upon the others. It is\r\nto be noted that, in all these, we hear only of flying locusts, and\r\nanyone would imagine by reading of them that it was by such, and no\r\nothers, that all the damage was done. In Africa, however, and also in\r\nCyprus—from which we may assume that it is the same elsewhere—the case\r\nis widely different. Writing evidently as a locust expert of the former\r\ncountry, Dr. Æneas Munro tells us that it is in their early wingless\r\nstate—answering to the caterpillar one, though far less differentiated\r\nfrom the perfect form—that the most terrible, the overwhelming, injury\r\nis inflicted by these insects. Of the full-grown flying locusts he says,\r\n“To a certain extent, they do injure here and there, where they select\r\nto settle and feed; but they do not devour everything clean before them,\r\nlike the army of the larval stage or jumpers.”[18] Of the latter and its\r\ndoings _ab ovo_ we have the following interesting account: “When the\r\ntiny creatures issue from their nest they are of a greenish white or\r\ncreamy colour, about an eighth of an inch in length,” and on the day\r\nthat they do so “the very dust of the ground, which was so still before,\r\nnow seems to waken into life. They begin to move by a process of\r\ntwisting or rolling over one another, so that, for the first few days,\r\nthey receive the name of twisters. Within eight or ten days, however,\r\nthey can jump four or six inches, and at the age of three or four weeks\r\na new characteristic makes its appearance. A desire to explore manifests\r\nitself, and in a surprising manner. The whole company moves in a body in\r\none general direction, and more or less in a straight line, as if by one\r\ncommon instinct, without apparently having any recognised leader or\r\ncommander,”[18] which is just the way, in my opinion, that rooks and\r\nstarlings move.[19]\r\n\r\nMarching in this way they spread themselves out over the country,\r\n“eating everything that comes in their way—wheat (if sufficiently young\r\nand tender), maize (even if strong and old), corn, sugar-cane, linseed,\r\nalfalfa (lucerne), pasture of all kinds, vegetables of all kinds\r\n(tomatoes and celery), and all garden produce, potatoes (ordinary and\r\nsweet), the leaves and sometimes even the bark of the trees, causing\r\ntheir ruin. The fruit, of course, is lost for the season. Orange,\r\nwillow, poplar, palm, banana, peach, pear, plum, vine, acacia, roses,\r\netc., are stripped,” but not “the gum and paradise trees, which seem to\r\nbe poisonous to them. They make everything ‘clean bare’; sometimes they\r\nwill enter houses, and eat the very clothes and curtains at the\r\nwindows.”[20] They will even eat the wool off the backs of the sheep,\r\nand “last stage of all that ends this strange, eventful history,” on a\r\npressing occasion they will eat one another. Continuing his interesting\r\naccount—the graphic and convincing one of an eye-witness— Dr. Munro\r\ntells us that “when these hoppers and jumpers (_voetgangers_, as the\r\nBoers call them) are on the march, they sometimes appear so determined\r\nand bent on the fearful execution of their work, that they resemble and\r\nhave got the name of ‘an army on the march.’ They move in open file, and\r\ncarry themselves in a proud, haughty way, with heads high up and fixed.\r\nIt is beautiful and interesting to see them on the march, if we only\r\ndivest ourselves for the moment of the idea of their devastating\r\nobject.”[20] And again, “The whole of the company begin to walk at the\r\nsame time, as if by order; the head is kept erect, and the neck is as if\r\nstiffened. They go straight on, irrespective of danger,”[20] and are\r\ndeterred, as is well known, by hardly any obstacle. “The sight of this\r\narmy is a very impressive one, and once seen will never be forgotten. In\r\nsome respects it is an awful sight; the spectacle strikes you with pity\r\nand sorrow to see at once before you that the toil and the labour for\r\nthe season, or, indeed, the year, is lost.”[20]\r\n\r\n“It is in this marching stage,” continues Dr. Munro, “that the\r\n_voetgangers_ do enormous damage and eat every edible thing in their\r\npath, and completely destroy the work of the husbandman. They are not\r\ncontent with levying toll merely, but they will have all, and will leave\r\nnothing behind but desolation. They are therefore unlike the flying\r\ncompany of locusts, which only levy toll here and there, but these, when\r\nthey pass, leave nothing.”\r\n\r\nSome curious facts are then given in regard to the uniform\r\ndirection—varying according to the country—in which these wingless\r\nlocusts march. The account will be remembered of how a flying host came\r\nto the banks of a river which they refrained from crossing. One might\r\nalmost think that a mistake had here been made, and that the locusts\r\nwere really _voetgangers_, but had they been so, the river, unless a\r\nlarge one, need not have deterred them—at least, they will pass streams,\r\nthough doubtless great numbers are sacrificed in doing so. If, however,\r\nthe stream had run parallel to the direction in which the swarm was\r\nadvancing, we can understand, in the light of what seems to be now\r\nestablished, their not crossing it.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Æneas Munro, The Locust Plague and its Suppression.\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  E.

In certain\r\ncountries the direction may be known. In this country (South Africa) it\r\nwill be found that they march towards the south, and not towards the\r\nnorth, east, or west, though either of these directions might have been\r\nbetter for them. The direction may not be true south; it may incline at\r\none time to the south-east, at another to the south-west; but, taken as\r\na whole, it will be southwards.” And he adds: “If proof be needed that\r\nthe ‘_saltonas_,’ another name—perhaps the Portuguese one—for these\r\nwingless armies, march in one direction, it is abundantly found in the\r\nexperience of the screen and trap, or Cypriote system of destroying\r\nlocusts, which is based on this fact, and on this alone. This is\r\nconclusive demonstration.”[21]\r\n\r\nThe distance that these footgangers—to translate, almost without\r\nchanging, the Dutch word—go in a day depends upon the amount of food\r\nthey find upon the road, but fluctuates, as a rule, between one mile and\r\ntwo. They start about eight o’clock, when the sun begins to get hot; and\r\nhalt for the night a little before the sun sets. Dr. Munro describes the\r\nway in which the female locust, before laying her eggs, drills a hole in\r\nthe hard ground with the disc-like extremity of her abdomen, but he\r\nmentions nothing very peculiar in connection with the laying of the eggs\r\nsuch as characterises the performance of that ceremony by the Australian\r\nplague locust, as will be mentioned shortly.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PLAGUE OF LOCUSTS]\r\n\r\n    The dark cloud is entirely composed of locusts, which\r\n      sometimes fill the air from twenty feet to two or three\r\n      thousand feet above the ground. The poor people attempt in\r\n      vain, by shouts, by lighting fires, and waving branches, to\r\n      avert the attack.\r\n\r\nThe first appearance of these locusts is in enormous hosts, which may\r\nsometimes be seen at a distance of from seven to ten miles, and then\r\nappear as a black cloud in the clear and rarefied air of South Africa.\r\n“It is impossible,” says Dr. Munro, “to estimate the number of locusts\r\nin these clouds, but some idea may be formed from the fact that when\r\nthey are driven, as sometimes is the case in a storm, into the sea, so\r\nmany are washed ashore that they lie on the beach as a bank from three\r\nto four feet thick and from fifty to one hundred miles in length, and\r\nthe stench from the corruption of their bodies, it is affirmed, is\r\nsensibly perceived for a hundred and fifty miles inland.”[22] The aerial\r\nmovements of the locusts, when they fairly surround one, are described\r\nas “curious, interesting, and pretty.” Distant vision (more especially\r\noverhead) is impeded on account of their numbers. The effect when you\r\nlook on them in the sun’s rays resembles “snow falling thickly and\r\ngently,” and the sun is only seen as though it were in eclipse. “Its\r\nlight is darkened and shadows cannot then be cast from it.”[23] The\r\nheight at which the swarm flies may be anything between forty feet and\r\ntwo miles from the ground, but as a rule it is not greater than 400\r\nfeet, though from 500 to 800 is not uncommon. Sometimes they fly by\r\nmoonlight, but this is not their usual practice. As in their earlier\r\nwingless state, they seem to act by one common impulse, which prevents\r\nconfusion. It is obvious, indeed, that with such myriads filling the\r\nwhole air, a leader could neither be perceived nor followed, and from my\r\nown observations I am convinced that the same difficulty applies to this\r\nway of explaining the movements of flocks of birds. I have never,\r\nmyself, seen any evidence of birds being led by one or more of their\r\nnumber, but much to convince me that when banded together, in numbers,\r\ntheir movements are governed by a totally different principle, viz. that\r\nof thought transference or thought-unity—collective thinking, as I have\r\nelsewhere called it—for that is what it most suggests. If this is not\r\nthe case with locusts, what, I would ask, is the alternative\r\nexplanation? If great hosts of men be neither led nor of one mind where\r\nto go, they must fall into confusion, impeding one another’s movements,\r\nand this is a law which has to do with numbers merely, without respect\r\nto the species of which they are composed. It has often been noticed,\r\nhowever, that large crowds seem liable to be swayed suddenly by some\r\ncommon impulse.\r\n\r\nLocusts may fly about a district all day doing but little harm, “and at\r\nsundown,” says Dr. Munro, “the sight becomes interesting beyond\r\ndescription, for the whole company then appear to vie with one another\r\nin order to roost quickly.”[23] When all have found a resting-place,\r\n“every twig, branch, bush, or separate stalk of the corn or wheat or\r\nflax are completely covered, and sometimes they stick to each\r\nother”[23]—three or four deep even. “As far as the eye can see, the\r\nsurface assumes a brownish-red hue. Pillars, posts, or the walls of\r\nhouses are all alike to them at the time of roosting for the night.”[23]\r\n\r\nSuch, then, is the Plague Locust of South Africa, which is, when at\r\nmaturity, about three inches long. Some years ago, however—the exact\r\ndate is not given—a larger and handsomer species made its appearance,\r\nand is thus referred to in a letter which was sent by “A Disgusted\r\nFarmer” of Grahamstown to one of the South African papers: “The new red\r\nlocust, which, during the last month, has spread from the Orange River\r\nto the sea, coming apparently from the north as well as from Natal, is\r\ndoing terrible damage. Everywhere fruit-trees are being\r\ndestroyed—quince, apricot, fig, orange, lemon, naartje trees. Not only\r\nare the leaves eaten, but young branches are all barked, so that they\r\nare probably killed. A splendid crop of mealies, covering the whole of\r\nPeddie, Lower Albany, Alexandria, and other districts, has been entirely\r\ndestroyed. Pumpkin plants are being eaten too. Vegetables of all\r\nkinds—lucerne, cattle-cabbage, and kale—are also swept away. The locusts\r\nare laying everywhere, and, no doubt, the plague will continue some\r\nyears. What is the agricultural farmer to do?”[23] I do not know, but\r\nhere, probably, were there locusts, he would pick out all such birds as\r\nfed on them and try to get them taken off the list of protected species,\r\nshooting them illegally all the while he was petitioning.\r\n\r\nDr. Munro’s work was published in 1900, and its principal object was to\r\ninduce the South African Government to adopt the system of dealing with\r\nthe locust plague which had been practised with such entire success in\r\nthe isle of Cyprus. Whether this has since been done, and with what\r\nresults, I am unable to say. In Cyprus, however, the locusts, which from\r\nthe year 1600, especially, have changed the country from a garden into a\r\nwilderness, were in one season almost entirely swept away. The method by\r\nwhich so great a result was effected is the invention of an Italian\r\ngentleman—Signor Matthei by name—resident in the island, and is based\r\nupon the inability of the immature locusts, the footgangers—probably the\r\ngrown ones too, but this is immaterial—to crawl up a smooth\r\nperpendicular, still more an overhanging surface. Such a surface was\r\nsupplied by a long band of leather, glazed and polished, surmounting a\r\nstrip of calico, which was made about four feet high, but need not, as\r\nit was afterwards found, have been more than two. This insurmountable\r\nobstacle, supported at intervals by sticks set in the ground—not\r\nupright, but slanting a little towards the path of the locusts—was set\r\nup over a large area of country like a miniature Chinese Wall, and\r\nproved even more insurmountable. At intervals along the inner side of\r\nthe barrier deep pits were dug, whilst at wider ones stood men provided\r\nwith brooms, spades, brushwood, and all else requisite. When the locusts\r\narrived at the Chinese Wall they climbed up the canvas part of it, but\r\nbeing unable to pass the smooth band of leather they fell down in heaps,\r\nand their ever-increasing multitudes soon filled the pits, in which they\r\nwere buried, burnt, stamped down, or otherwise provided for. Afterwards\r\ntheir carcases were dug out and heaped on carts, and the pits, being\r\nempty again, were ready for more. In this way two hundred million\r\nquadrillion billions—or something of that sort—of locusts were\r\ndestroyed, and next year when everything was again ready for them hardly\r\nany appeared. By this invention, as simple as it is ingenious and\r\ninexpensive, the locust plague in Cyprus has become a thing of the past,\r\nand if the conferrer of so great a benefit was ever not a man of large\r\nfortune, let us hope that that has become a thing of the past, too, for\r\nhe must have saved several to the British Government. If the locusts,\r\nafter coming to the Chinese Wall and finding themselves unable to climb\r\nit, had turned round and walked in another direction, this would have\r\nmade a capital instance of intelligence shown by insects—but they did\r\nnot do so.\r\n\r\nWith native labour, the above system, which has been so entirely\r\nsuccessful in Cyprus, could, Dr. Munro makes no doubt, be put in\r\noperation in Africa; but Mr. W. W. Froggatt, the Government entomologist\r\nof Australia, does not think it adapted for that country. Writing in\r\n_The Agricultural Gazette_ of New South Wales (March, 1901), Mr.\r\nFroggatt says, “Though they have been successfully dealt with in Cyprus,\r\nEgypt, Algeria, and India by means of trenches, traps, and burning in\r\nthe hopper state, and digging up and destroying the eggs in the earlier\r\nstage, in nearly all cases the areas infested were comparatively small;\r\nthe labour employed was so cheap that small armies of natives could be\r\nemployed at a small cost to destroy them, while in several instances an\r\nautocratic government made the natives, whether they were inclined or\r\nnot, work at their plan of destruction.” In Australia, where, “whether\r\nthey were inclined or not,” the natives have been got rid of, very much\r\nas though they were locusts—or some less stubborn insects—themselves,\r\nthis would not do.\r\n\r\nIt was in the summer of 1899 that Mr. Froggatt, in consequence of\r\nreports received of the advent of locusts in various parts of the\r\ncountry, left Sydney for Condobolin. On the way there many “mobs”—to use\r\nthe Australian word—were encountered, and numbers of locusts flew in at\r\nthe railway carriage windows. Upon alighting, Mr. Froggatt became the\r\nwitness of a very interesting spectacle—a ceremony, as it may well be\r\ncalled, in which vast numbers of the insects were engaged—of which he\r\ngives the following description:—\r\n\r\n“In the open red soil we found them laying their eggs in thousands, and\r\nthe operation was very remarkable. The female set to work by pressing\r\nthe tip of her abdomen into the soil, and working the plates at the\r\napex, so that she gradually bored a regular circular shaft, slightly\r\nover an inch in depth and under a quarter of an inch in diameter, the\r\nsegments of the abdomen extending and stretching as the work progressed.\r\nBut the most extraordinary part of the operation was that each female,\r\nwhile boring the chamber to deposit the eggs, was attended by two males,\r\neach of which rested his head against hers, with his antennas resting\r\nover her head, and the inner foreleg clasped over the prothorax behind\r\nthe base of the head. Resting like this, with the tails of the two\r\nattendant males pointing outwards, the three formed a three-rayed star.\r\nWherever the business of egg-laying was going on, each female and her\r\nattendants were surrounded by a cluster of admiring males, averaging\r\nfrom thirty to fifty in number, generally in bunches of fours or fives,\r\nforming an irregular ring round them, but separated from her by a clear\r\nspace of three or four inches. In no instance were there ever more than\r\ntwo males touching the female, though we examined thousands of them at\r\nwork.”[24]\r\n\r\nWhat is the meaning of this odd performance?—this ceremony, as it\r\nappears to me, though Mr. Froggatt takes a utilitarian view of it. “The\r\nprobable and only reason,” he remarks, “that I can see for the\r\nattendance of the two males upon the egg-laying female is that it\r\nenables her to get a firmer grip of the ground, and, in fact, holds her\r\nin position till she completes her task.”[24] But why, then, should the\r\nfemales of no other species of locust, as far as we are aware, require\r\nthis aid, and should not the soil of Africa be as hard as that of\r\nAustralia? “I can find,” says Mr. Froggatt, “no record of this habit in\r\nany of our described species, which have the same habits.”[24] Again,\r\nbesides the two chief actors, we have the admiring ring of from thirty\r\nto fifty males, who can be of no possible service, but whose conduct\r\nshows that they take a strong interest in what the female is doing. What\r\nis it, too, that regulates the number, or, at any rate, the personality\r\nof the assistant males? If it is a matter of rendering assistance only,\r\nand the two males who do so are bound to the female by no more special\r\ntie than the crowd of interested spectators, why do not these, or some\r\nof them, push forward? Why is there never any contention between them?\r\nThese considerations make me think that there is something of a formal\r\nand ceremonious character about these queer proceedings, and that they\r\nare governed by the same general law as are certain antics or set\r\nfigures amongst birds, wherein three individuals take a part. What one\r\nrequires to know is the courting and marital relations of the male and\r\nfemale locust before the egg-laying takes place.\r\n\r\nThese little locusts—_Epacromia terminalis_ is the specific name—are\r\nonly about an inch in length, and the male, from the description, seems\r\na little brighter than the female, which may be due to sexual selection.\r\nThe female appears to lay nineteen eggs only, neither more nor less,\r\nwhich is not so many as one would have expected from the Arabian legend.\r\nWith some other species, however, the number more conforms to the\r\nstatement said to have been made to Mahomet.\r\n\r\nThere is no vanity at all in my thinking that this has been an\r\ninteresting account of locusts, since I myself have had nothing to do\r\nwith it. In giving a general description, from general reading, of\r\nthings generally known, and that have been described scores of times\r\nbefore, one is entitled to use one’s own language, and to think,\r\nperhaps, that one stands at no particular disadvantage in doing so. But\r\nwhen, in regard to something specially curious or interesting, the\r\ngraphic words of an eye-witness are before one, the best thing one can\r\ndo, in my opinion, is to copy them out. If it be suggested that this is\r\nbut a lazy way of writing a book, my reply is that a compiler best shows\r\nhis industry in the searching out of material. The late Professor\r\nRomanes was alive to this fact, and has left us in consequence his\r\n_Animal Intelligence_—one of the most interesting books that exist, in\r\nmy opinion—about one-eighth of which, or perhaps a little more, is\r\nwritten by himself.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Æneas Munro, The Locust Plague and its Suppression.\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\n  The Agricultural Gazette of New South Wales, March, 1900.\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Æneas Munro, The Locust Plague and its Suppression.\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  The Agricultural Gazette of New South Wales, March, 1900.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\n    Locusts and _locustidæ_—The most musical grasshoppers—Katydid\r\n      concerts—A much-resembling note—Cricket thermometers—Cicadas\r\n      and sounding-boards—Admired musicians—An appreciative\r\n      audience.\r\n\r\nLOCUSTS, as everybody knows, belong to the grasshopper family, but it\r\nmay surprise some who have read the grumblings of the learned over\r\npopular names—white ants, hedge-sparrows, etc.—to find that\r\nentomologists have so managed matters that they do not belong to the\r\n_locustidæ_—which is one of the two groups into which all grasshoppers\r\nare divided—but to the other group. There are long-horned grasshoppers\r\nand short-horned grasshoppers. The long-horned ones, which are not\r\nlocusts, are all of them _locustidæ_, but none of the _locustidæ_ are\r\nlocusts, because locusts have short horns. Entomologists think it would\r\nbe absurd to alter this, after it has gone on so long, a view in which\r\nornithologists, with their _storm_-petrels and hedge-_accentors_, no\r\ndoubt agree with them. A mere popular name, with its roots in the Saxon\r\nor Celtic, can be changed, and there an end, but scientific nonsense, in\r\nLatin, and begun by Linnæus, as is generally the case, let no man\r\npresume to meddle with.\r\n\r\nIt is amongst the _locustidæ_ that we find the most musical of the\r\ngrasshoppers, the Katydids—so well known and highly appreciated in the\r\nUnited States—standing on a far higher level in this respect than the\r\ncomparatively unmusical locusts. Not that the _locustidæ_—however\r\nmusical—use their long horns for blowing purposes. Properly speaking,\r\nthese are only antennæ, and function as such, the musical apparatus\r\nbeing situated elsewhere. The Katydids, for instance, rasp their fore\r\nwings against each other, according to the general idea, three times in\r\nsuccession, producing the three syllables, Ka—ty—did, which have given\r\nthe insect its name, but according to Mr. Scudder[25] only twice, which\r\nmakes either “Katy,” or “She did”; that is to say, as a general rule,\r\nfor he admits the three on occasions. The notes are uttered with great\r\nemphasis, and at the rate of some two hundred in the minute, the\r\nperformance continuing, at least in the case of some species, all day\r\nand all night long.\r\n\r\nA number of grasshoppers go by the name of Katydids in America, but the\r\ngeneral type of the insect is a graceful, green, fragile-looking\r\ncreature, with very long, slender antennæ, and, in the female, a long\r\novipositor at the other end, as if to balance matters. There are many\r\nspecies, and all, or most of them, sing both by night and day, and what\r\nis very remarkable, or, at least, very interesting, they have a\r\ndifferent note for either. Speaking of one—or, rather, of a long-horned\r\ngrasshopper nearly related to the Katydids, but not actually a member of\r\nthe sisterhood—which he had been watching in the sunshine, Mr. Scudder\r\nsays: “As a cloud passed over the sun he suddenly changed his note to\r\none with which I was already familiar, but without knowing to what\r\ninsect it belonged. At the same time, all the individuals around, whose\r\nsimilar day-song I had heard, began to respond with the night-cry. The\r\ncloud passed away, and the original note was resumed on all sides.”[26]\r\n_Scudderia angustifolia_ is the name of this little musician, so called,\r\nperhaps, because so sensitive to scudding clouds. But the Katydids do\r\nmore than merely play an individual tune, each on his own instrument.\r\nThey hold concerts, at which many join together to make an elaborate\r\nmusical display, a certain number commencing on one note, and others\r\njoining in harmoniously on another. There are leaders, whose business it\r\nis to hold the time-measure, and, by a steady insistence on the right\r\nnote, to draw back any who may happen for a moment to get out of tune.\r\nThe orchestra is divided into so many companies, who support and assist\r\none another, so that the whole makes a concerted harmony, in which there\r\nare many different movements. As a rule the performance is most\r\ncreditable, though occasionally the effect is marred by a careless\r\nplayer. Before commencing, the company always tunes up.\r\n\r\nPossibly it may be thought that there is some mistake here—that things\r\ncannot be quite like this. Personally I have no knowledge on the\r\nsubject—never having been to America—but here is what Dr. George M.\r\nGould says, writing in _Science_ for October or November, probably 1895,\r\nsince the number is referred to as “recent” in _Nature_ for December 5th\r\nof that year. “As soon as the sun has set and twilight is advancing, the\r\nKatydids in the trees begin to ‘tune up.’ The first notes are scattered,\r\nawkward and without rhythm, but if no wind is blowing thousands soon\r\njoin in, and from time to time, until daylight breaks, there is no\r\nintermission.... In order to make my description clearer, let us suppose\r\na thousand Katydids, scattered through the trees, to utter their several\r\nnotes all at once, and call them Company A. Another thousand—Company\r\nB—at once answers them, and this swing-swong is kept up, as I say, all\r\nnight. Company A’s note is the emphatic or accented note, and is more\r\ndefinitely and accurately a precise musical note, whilst the note of\r\nCompany B varies from one to five half-tones below, the most conspicuous\r\nnote being five. In the old-fashioned musical terms I learned as a boy,\r\nCompany A is, e.g., clearly and definitely _do_, while the note of\r\nCompany B is either _la_, or more certainly _sol_. Not only is Company\r\nA’s note more unisonal and definite, but it is firmer, more accented,\r\nand it seems to me that more insects join in this note than in the\r\nsecond. Careful observation has convinced me that no insect of Company A\r\nor Company B ever joins in the other company’s note. The rhythm is\r\nusually perfect, unless there is a disturbance by a breeze. A sharp gust\r\nupsets the whole orchestra, and confusion results, but the measured beat\r\nis soon refound. In the instants of confusion one can detect the steady\r\nsee-saw of certain ones, as it were, ‘leaders,’ or first violinists, who\r\nhold the time-measure, despite the wind, and who soon draw the lost\r\nnotes of the others once more into the regular measure or beat. I do not\r\nmean to say that by diligent attention one may not at times detect\r\nindividuals sawing out of tune, stray fellows that are indifferent or\r\ncareless, but the vast majority, usually even without a single\r\nexception, if there is no wind or rain, thus swing along, hour after\r\nhour, in perfect time. I have counted the beats several times, and find\r\nthe number is always identical: thirty-four double beats, or sixty-eight\r\nsingle ones, in sixty seconds. The effect of the rhythm upon the mind is\r\nnot unlike that of the woodman’s cross-cut saw, handled by two steady,\r\ntireless pairs of hands, although the Katydids give a larger volume of\r\nsound, and the _timbre_ is harsher.” Such is the account, and upon it\r\nDr. Gould asks two questions: “What function does the orchestration\r\nsubserve?” and “Is there anything comparable to it among other animals?”\r\n\r\nIn view of these performances of the Katydids one may perhaps question\r\nthe statement, often made, that crickets are _the_ most musical of all\r\ninsects. The Snowy Cricket, however, of the United States, and no doubt\r\nelsewhere in America, is a very striking performer, especially at night,\r\nwhen it emits sounds which Nathaniel Hawthorne has likened to “audible\r\nstillness,” and of which he says: “If moonlight could be heard it would\r\nsound like that.” Thoreau describes it as a “slumbrous breathing,” but\r\naccording to the State Entomologist of the United States, this\r\n“slumbrous breathing,” or “audible stillness,” consists of “a shrill\r\nre-teat, re-teat, re-teat,” which Mr. Leland Howard,[26] indeed, thinks\r\nthe best description, but is not quite my idea—nor probably\r\nHawthorne’s—of how moonlight would sound. Harrington—who I suppose is\r\nanother entomologist—does not interfere with any of these opinions, but\r\ndescribes something which he has seen, and can find nothing about in\r\nbooks. “While the male,” he says, “is energetically shuffling together\r\nhis wings, raised almost vertically, the female may be seen standing\r\njust behind him, and with her head applied to the base of the wings,\r\nevidently eager to get the full benefit of every note produced.”[26] No\r\ndoubt the female likes the notes—that, indeed, is the _rationale_ of\r\ntheir utterance—but what they are really like it is impossible to make\r\nout from these various descriptions, another of which, by the way, is “a\r\nrhythmic beat.” Possibly they are no more extraordinary (at any rate,\r\n“re-teat” is not) than those of our own, and cheerful, house-cricket,\r\nwhich to my ear have always sounded very pretty, but which Cowper\r\nevidently did not care about except as a matter of association, since he\r\nthus alludes to them in the _Task_:—\r\n\r\n          “Sounds inharmonious in themselves and harsh,\r\n           Yet heard in scenes where peace for ever (sic) reigns,\r\n           And only there, please highly for their sake.”\r\n\r\nNo doubt there are associations, though these, belonging to the kitchen,\r\nappear to me to be of another and blither description, but the “sounds”\r\nthemselves, in my opinion, are neither harsh nor inharmonious, as far as\r\nany unpleasantness to the ear is conveyed by the last word.\r\n\r\nOne interesting point about the song of crickets is that the number of\r\nnotes uttered in any given space of time—per minute, say—varies\r\naccording to the temperature, the two rising together. Professor\r\nDolbeare was the first, as far as I know, to call attention to this\r\nfact, and he is thus confirmed by a lady: “One cool evening a cricket\r\nwas caught and brought into a warm room. In a few minutes it began to\r\nchirp nearly twice as rapidly as the out-of-door crickets. Its rate very\r\nnearly conformed to the observed rate maintained on other evenings under\r\nthe same temperature conditions (as now indoors). From this series of\r\nobservations we found that the rate of chirping was, as Professor\r\nDolbeare says, very closely dependent on the temperature.”[27] So the\r\ncrickets are little thermometers—sixty-three degrees Fahrenheit to one\r\nhundred chirps per minute.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the Katydids give concerts, and we may therefore infer\r\nthat they like their own music in a musically appreciative way; that\r\nthey listen to each other as critical connoisseurs, whether they have\r\nother feelings or not, and that it is not a mere matter of the female\r\nalone admiring the sounds made by the male, just because _he_ makes\r\nthem. In all this, however, the admiration is confined—at least, as far\r\nas we know—to one species—that to which the musician belongs. Katydids\r\nappreciate the performances of Katydids. But there is one group of\r\nperformers whose music gives satisfaction, not merely to individuals of\r\nother species than their own, but to such as are not even included in\r\nthe same order with them, so that racial pride or family prejudice\r\ncannot be the reason of it. Towards these stars we will now turn our\r\ngaze.\r\n\r\nAll who have lived in the more southern parts of the world, including\r\nthe southern countries of Europe, must have made the acquaintance of the\r\ncicadas, for in these regions they are large insects, conspicuous by\r\ntheir appearance when once seen, and by their song long before they are\r\nnoticed. There is something very uncouth—one might almost say\r\ngrotesquely humorous—yet at the same time pleasing and lovable about the\r\nbroad flat heads and great goggle eyes of these insects, in the which it\r\nis easy to imagine some quaint sort of expression that seems to mean or\r\nsuggest something for which the language supplies no word. Their wings,\r\nboth long and broad, which, when folded, project far beyond the\r\nextremity of the abdomen, concealing everything save the great head and\r\nthe wide shield or boss of the thorax, help also in giving them a most\r\nsalient and characteristic appearance, and make them look more aerial\r\nthan they really are. Their legs, whilst they retain their ordinary\r\nresting attitude, are entirely hidden, and so too are the organs of the\r\nmouth, which combine to make a sharp-pointed beak. Thus their appearance\r\nis typical of air and sunshine, and anything so gross as mere feeding or\r\nterrestrial locomotion seems foreign to their nature. The ancients, who\r\nloved and admired the cicadas extremely, thinking them the most\r\nfortunate of creatures, supposed that they lived entirely on dew.\r\n\r\n                    “Oh Tettix, drunk with sipping dew,\r\n                     What musician equals you?”\r\n\r\nsings Anacreon, or someone who imitated him and wrote very gracefully,\r\nfor Tettix was a common Greek name for the cicada. Really they live on\r\nthe sap of the trees on which they sit, and there may even be two\r\nopinions about their music. To me it is pleasant enough—full of the joy\r\nof the sunshine, as it were, and its loudness and the continuous way in\r\nwhich it goes on excites one’s wonder. In regard to the way in which it\r\nis produced, Darwin says, at page 351 of his immortal work, _The Descent\r\nof Man_: “The sound, according to Laudois, who has recently studied the\r\nsubject, is produced by the vibration of the lips of the spiracles,\r\nwhich are set in motion by a current of air emitted by the tracheæ. It\r\nis increased by a wonderfully complex resounding apparatus, consisting\r\nof two cavities covered with scales. Hence the sound may truly be called\r\na voice. In the female the musical apparatus is present, but very much\r\nless developed than in the male, and is never used for producing sound.”\r\nAs the Greeks, who must have had their observers, used to say—\r\n\r\n                   “Happy the cicadas’ lives,\r\n                    Since they all have voiceless wives.”\r\n\r\nThis sounds all right—I mean the account of the apparatus—but according\r\nto Dr. Powell, of New Zealand, it is all wrong. Writing in the\r\n_Transactions of the New Zealand Institute_,[28] Dr. Powell, after\r\nquoting the above passage, says, “I am, of course, ignorant of the\r\ndetails of his description; but unless the cicada which he describes\r\ndiffers essentially in the nature of its musical organs from those found\r\nin New Zealand, and also from those described more or less correctly by\r\nother authors, especially Réaumur, he is most certainly in error.” Dr.\r\nPowell, then, after telling us that the stridulating organs of the\r\ncicada are constructed on a principle unique in nature, viz. a vibrating\r\nmembrane, continues: “In the male, on the upper surface of the first\r\nring of the abdomen, on either side, may be seen a crescent-shaped\r\nopening, and on examining this opening with a magnifying-glass it will\r\nbe seen to lead into a shallow cavity, closed in by a horny membrane.\r\nThis membrane is highly elastic, and the sound is produced by the\r\ncontraction of the muscle straightening out the folds of the membrane;\r\nthis produces a click and, on the muscle relaxing, the membrane, from\r\nits elasticity, springs back with another click.” That this is really\r\nthe way in which the sounds are produced seems proved by the fact that\r\n“if a live insect be caught, and these membranes be observed during the\r\nact of stridulation, they will be seen to be vibrating rapidly in time\r\nwith the beats of the shrill sound.”\r\n\r\nBut what about the “wonderfully complex resounding apparatus, consisting\r\nof two cavities covered with scales”? After a full examination and\r\nvarious experiments, Dr. Powell arrives at the unexpected conclusion\r\nthat the sound is in no way dependent upon these “large transparent,\r\ndrum-like membranes,” as he calls the cavities in question. I was “much\r\nsurprised,” he says, “to find that the large drums seemed to take no\r\npart in the production of the sound, and the idea occurred to me that\r\nthey might be hearing organs; but on examining the females, which are\r\ndumb and do not possess the stridulating organs, I found that the drums\r\nexist, indeed, but are quite rudimentary instead of being large, as we\r\nshould expect to find them, were they subservient to the sense of\r\nhearing.” If, however, the drums did answer the purpose of a resounding\r\napparatus in the male, we should expect to find them exactly as they are\r\nin the female, and so strong does the evidence of their suppression in\r\nher appear to me, that I cannot help thinking that, in spite of all Dr.\r\nPowell’s observations and experiments, he was somehow mistaken, and that\r\nin nature they do act in this way.\r\n\r\nAs to the quality of the sound produced by the cicada—of its song, as we\r\nmay call it—this varies greatly in the different species, for there are\r\nmany cicadas. Speaking of that of the largest—the great _Pomponia\r\nimperatoria_ of Borneo—as big as a mouse, one may almost say, Mr.\r\nAnnandale remarks, “The sound produced by this species is, at the\r\nbeginning of the song, like the winding up of a large clock, and ends by\r\nbeing comparable to the notes of a penny whistle. Between these extremes\r\nit rises in a series of trills, each of which concludes with a kind of\r\nclick. Each section of the song is faster, louder, and clearer than the\r\none which preceded it, until, almost five minutes after the cicada’s\r\nsettling, the noise suddenly comes to an end as the insect flies off to\r\nanother tree, where it commences again.”[29] This great pompous imperial\r\ninsect—to give it a free rendering of its Latin name—sits shrouded in\r\nthe mysteries of the deeper jungle, while smaller and less majestic\r\nbabblers haunt its skirtings and the village groves. “Another species,\r\ncommonly heard at night in the jungle, has a clear, loud, clarion-like\r\ncall, which can be heard for a great distance.”[29]\r\n\r\nOf the three New Zealand species of cicada—or those found in\r\nCanterbury—a large and small green, and a black one, the two first, Dr.\r\nPowell tells us, say “crrrk-crrrk-crrrk,” the second “r-r-r-r-r-r,” and\r\nthe third “crrrk-rrrrr,” _ad infinitum_. “Many persons,” he adds, “are\r\ntotally unable to hear the voice of the small green cicada, or any very\r\nacute sounds, and inasmuch as the entire range of the human ear is,\r\naccording to Helmholtz, eleven octaves, it has been justly remarked that\r\nthe air may be filled with shrill insect sounds, which may be perfectly\r\naudible to the insects themselves, but absolutely inaudible to our\r\ngrosser senses.”[30]\r\n\r\nIt is in Natal—at least, the fact has been observed there—that the\r\ncicadas, as they sing, are listened to by admiring groups of other\r\ninsects. These appear to be beautiful creatures, having wings of a\r\nsoft, gauzy texture, but iridescent, and shot with the colours of the\r\nrainbow. A band of these radiant attendants, consisting sometimes of a\r\ndozen or fifteen, fly to the tree where a cicada is sitting and\r\narrange themselves in a semicircle around it, facing its head. They\r\nare “all ear” evidently, and, as the sweet sounds continue, one or\r\nother of the listeners will advance and touch the antennæ or legs of\r\nthe object of its admiration. Such marks of appreciation, however,\r\nthough flattering in proportion to their undoubted sincerity, are not\r\nto the taste of the cicada, who will sometimes, whilst in the midst of\r\nits song, strike out vigorously with a foot or so—for, of course, it\r\nhas six—causing its too obtrusive admirers to retreat to a more\r\nrespectful distance, where they continue to listen with every sign of\r\nbeing extremely pleased.[31] Some years ago we did not even know the\r\nname of these musical-connoisseur-like, and withal very beautiful\r\ninsects, but now they have been identified by Mr. Kirby, at the\r\nBritish Museum, as _Nothochrysa gigantea_, so we are all much the\r\nwiser, and have a weight lifted from our minds.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 25:\r\n\r\n  Leland O.

All is in order, as it now appears:\r\nthe cicada’s case has been considered, and a very handsome wasp provided\r\nfor it. At least, I think it is handsome. It is large and strong, I\r\nknow, as is necessary for the part it has to perform, but I cannot quite\r\nremember the colours it flies under; an expression which, though\r\nmetaphorical, may be pardoned, since flags have much to do with such\r\ndramas as that now to be described. For as the joyous, sun-loving\r\ncreature sits in its accustomed place, chirupping forth those shrill yet\r\nmusical notes which I, at least, have never wearied of, the destroyer is\r\nat hand, and settling on its broad back, curves its abdomen beneath that\r\nof the poor blithe singer, and in a moment has done its work. As the\r\nsting enters, the happy note that has been sounding regularly for the\r\nlast hour, perhaps, is changed to a discordant scream of pain, and with\r\na spasmodic spring or flutter—the last, or near the last, that it will\r\never make—the cicada, with the wasp still clinging to it, falls to the\r\nground. This is awkward for the wasp, who doubtless considers herself\r\naggrieved in the matter, since the cicada is so bulky that, powerful as\r\nshe is, she can neither lift it from the ground in flight, nor is she\r\nprepared to drag it all the way to her burrow. What, then, is she to do,\r\nor of what use to her is the prize she has obtained with such\r\nadroitness? But she has her plan, and though the captious behaviour of\r\nthe cicada has, for the moment, a little deranged it, it is not\r\npermanently frustrated. Slowly, but with firm insistence, she drags her\r\nvictim to the tree on which a moment before it was so happily seated,\r\nand then exerting all her force, begins to mount the trunk with it.\r\nOften she has to pause and rest, often it seems as though the task would\r\nbe beyond her, but she continues the laborious ascent, sometimes for\r\nupwards of an hour, until at last a height has been reached at which it\r\nis possible for her to put her great project into execution. This is no\r\nother than to fly down obliquely, with her victim clasped in her arms,\r\nto the pleasant little sarcophagus which she has previously prepared for\r\nit, for though flight upwards, or in a straight line, with such a\r\nburden, is out of the question, her strength is equal to this. It is\r\nnecessary, however, that she should balance the body nicely, and make a\r\nfair and uninterrupted start, in order not to be overweighted and again\r\nfall. Her enterprise is “full of poise and difficult weight,” and cannot\r\nbe successfully carried out in face of the rude struggles of a tiresome\r\nobstructive not “in tune with the infinite.” These struggles, however,\r\nhave now ceased; the cicada is in a comatose condition, and, having\r\nadjusted it properly, and assumed the requisite attitude and position,\r\nour wasp—whose scientific name, by the way, is _Sphecius\r\nspeciosus_—launches herself, with “the white man’s burden” she has\r\n“taken up,” from her coign of vantage, and reaches home with it in\r\nsafety. How high she has previously ascended the tree I cannot say,\r\nsince my informant does not, but it would be interesting to ascertain\r\nboth this and the average distance which she has to fly to her nest, and\r\nto compare the one with the other. Unless the latter is very much\r\ngreater than the former—and as the journey is constantly downwards it\r\ncannot, one would think, be very far—then we must see in the wasp’s\r\nchoice of a toilsome ascent up a perpendicular tree-trunk, in preference\r\nto a horizontal journey along the ground, a triumph of instinct over\r\nintelligence, and it is, indeed, quite possible that, having always been\r\naccustomed to fly back with her prize, which perhaps was not always so\r\nheavy, she should go through as much labour to enable her to do this as,\r\ndifferently directed, would attain the end for which it is employed.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A WASP BEARING OFF A CICADA.]\r\n\r\n    After the wasp has killed the cicada, they both fall to the\r\n      ground. Strong as the wasp is it is not easy for her to\r\n      carry such a heavy insect to her nest. But she has her plan.\r\n      Slowly but persistently she drags her victim to a tree-trunk\r\n      and up it, though it may take her an hour to reach the\r\n      requisite height. Then she sails off for her nest on an\r\n      inclined plane, with wings extended, and her victim clasped\r\n      in her arms.\r\n\r\nThe burrow of this wasp consists, we are told, “of a gently sloping\r\nentrance, extending for about six inches, when, ordinarily, a turn is\r\nmade at right angles, and the excavation is continued for six or eight\r\ninches farther, ending in a globular cell an inch and a half in\r\ndiameter. Frequently a number of branches leave the main burrow at about\r\nthe same point, each terminating in a round cell.”[32] In each of these\r\ncells either one or two cicadas are deposited, and it would seem that\r\nwhen there are two, only one of these is provided with an egg, so that\r\nsome of the wasp-larvæ have double rations. As the female _speciosus_\r\n(her arguments, I think, would need to be specious to make one in love\r\nwith a scheme in which she plays such a part) is very much larger than\r\nthe male, it seems more than probable that the female eggs are laid in\r\nthe chambers which contain two cicadæ, and the male ones in those which\r\naccommodate a single one only. If so, then these solitary wasps must\r\nhave the same control over the sex of the eggs laid by them as the queen\r\nbee has. The social ones, should this be the case, no doubt have, too,\r\nbut as the former must have preceded the latter, it would appear that\r\nthis power has not been developed to meet the needs of a complex state\r\nof society—as has been generally supposed—but in accordance with much\r\nmore simple conditions. The fact, however, if it be one, has not yet\r\nbeen demonstrated.\r\n\r\n“The delicate white, elongate egg of the wasp is laid under the middle\r\nleg of the cicada, and when it hatches, the larva protrudes its head and\r\nbegins at once to draw nourishment from between the segments of its\r\nvictim. The egg hatches in two or three days, and the larva attains full\r\ngrowth in a week, or a little more. It feeds entirely from the outside,\r\nand, when full-grown, spins a white silken cocoon (mixed with much\r\nearth, however), which is finished at the expiration of two days. It\r\nremains in the cocoon, unchanged, through the winter, transforming to\r\npupa only in the following spring, and shortly before the appearance of\r\nthe true insect. When the adult hatches it gnaws its way out of the\r\ncocoon, and so on up through the burrow to the surface of the ground,\r\nthus completing its life-round in a full year.”[32] How long, exactly,\r\nthe life of the cicada lasts after it has entered into hospitable\r\nrelations with the _speciosus_ I am unable to say.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, is the end of the cicada, in spite of the love of Apollo,\r\nwho, according to the Anacreontic ode, bestowed upon it its shrill song.\r\nThus it dies, though “cherished by the Muses, painless and fleshless,\r\nalmost equal to the gods.” Whether it be fleshless _speciosus_, in the\r\nlarval state, best knows (on the latter point there will have been no\r\nmeans of comparison), that it is painless one can only hope. It is\r\nsomething, however, to be so known to fame. Homer himself alludes to the\r\ncicada in terms of respect, calling its shrill song “delicate music,”\r\nwhilst Hesiod tells of “the dark-winged Tettix, when he begins to sing\r\nto men of the coming summer; he whose meat and drink is of the\r\nrefreshing dew, and who all day long and at break of day pours forth his\r\nvoice.”\r\n\r\nThere was no end, apparently, to the love of the ancients—especially the\r\nGreeks—for the cicadas, or tettiges—for they were known by both names—or\r\nto the graceful things they said of them. From poets and philosophers\r\ndown to ploughmen, all were equally fond of them. “We bless thee,\r\nTettix,” says a poet whose name has been merged in that of one who is\r\nnow a name only, though a great one—Anacreon, namely—“We bless thee for\r\nthat seated on the tree-tops, sipping the dew, thou singest royally....\r\nOh, sweetest of summer prophets! honoured by mortals, thou art cherished\r\nby the Muses. Phœbus himself loves thee, and gave thee thy shrill song”;\r\nand Plato tells us that “as music soothes the mind and dissipates\r\nfatigue, so the ploughman loves and cherishes the cicada for its song.”\r\nThe Greek ploughman, apparently, was a less gross embodiment than the\r\none of the present day, after twenty-five centuries or so of\r\nimprovement. To Apollo the cicadas were sacred, because they\r\n“everlastingly sang to the sun,”[33] and, for the Muses, they had once\r\nsupplied their place. “As the story goes,” says Plato, “before the Muses\r\nlived the cicadas were men on earth, and so loved song and singing that,\r\nto lose no time from it, they left off eating, and so died of that dear\r\ndelight. But, in death, they became cicadas, and this boon was granted\r\nthem by the Muses, lately born, that on earth they should eat no more,\r\nbut only sing until they died again, and that then they should return to\r\nthe Muses to tell them who, amongst mortals, loved and worshipped them\r\nmost.” “A lover of music like yourself,” says Socrates in the “Phædrus”\r\nof Plato, addressing one of _his_ worshippers, “ought surely to have\r\nheard this story of the cicadas, how they were once human beings, but\r\ndied through forgetting to eat. But now, dear to the Muses, they hunger\r\nno more, thirst no more, but sing only, from their birth. And in heaven\r\nthey tell Terpsichore of the dancers, Erato of the lovers, Calliope,\r\neldest of the nine, and Urania, of those whose heart is in\r\nphilosophy—and thus they whisper to them all.”\r\n\r\nSo established were these and similar stories that, in Greece, a cicada\r\nperched on a harp was often engraved upon gems as the symbol of the\r\nMuses, and, were there a musical contest, one had only to settle on the\r\nlyre or pipe of the competitor it favoured, for the prize to be\r\ninstantly adjudged to that one—since Apollo was then held to have\r\nspoken. Only in the absence of such indication were other methods of\r\nforming a conclusion resorted to. In common with other graceful\r\ncreatures, cicadas were often kept as pets by the Greeks, and that\r\nmausoleums were sometimes raised to these favourites we know from the\r\nfollowing epigram of the poetess Anytie—written probably for the friend\r\nit celebrates:—“For a grasshopper, a nightingale of the fields, and for\r\nan oak-haunting cicada Myro has built one common tomb. There the maiden\r\nsits and weeps for three pets, torn from her by unrelenting Hades.”\r\n\r\nAmongst the Athenians the cicadas were looked upon as children of the\r\nsoil of Attica, and those only who, like them, had been born upon it,\r\nwere permitted to twist the golden tettix, or bodkin, amidst their\r\nflowing locks, thus forming the knot in which they were accustomed to\r\nwear them. This privileged bodkin received its name through being\r\nsurmounted with the head, in gold, of a cicada, or tettix, and the\r\nwearers—or bearers—of these insignia—which were strictly forbidden to\r\nstrangers—were known for this reason as Tettigophori. They were most\r\nproud of the distinction, and, indeed, as it showed them to be\r\nAthenians, they had a somewhat better right to be than is common in such\r\ncases. Yet, amidst all this praise, we meet, here and there, with a\r\ndissentient note. Hercules, for instance, feeling inclined to sleep,\r\nonce, on the banks of the river, opposite where the town of Locris\r\nstood, and not being able to, on account of the perpetual singing of the\r\ncicadas, took it so seriously that he prayed to the gods to put a stop\r\nto their disturbing him. The gods, with whom Hercules was always a\r\nfavourite, heard his prayer, and cicadas, from that time, ceased to sing\r\nopposite Locris, though they swarmed all round about that town. Here it\r\nseems just to be hinted that Hercules was not very fond of the cicadas’\r\nsong, and Virgil—but he was a Roman—has called it (_infandum!_) a\r\n_creaking_ note. On the whole, however, when he mentions these insects,\r\nhe gives us a pleasing picture.\r\n\r\n              “_Sole sub ardenti, resonant arbusta cicadis_,”\r\n\r\nhe sings; a line which seems bathed in sunlight, and makes one see the\r\ngreen lizards too. On the whole I cannot help thinking that Virgil loved\r\nthe cicadas.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to find that in modern Italy, generally, but\r\nespecially in Tuscany, the old ideas and legends in regard to the\r\ncicadas have not yet died out. Still, according to the Tuscan peasant,\r\nthey were maids—not men—before the Muses, till Apollo, as a mark of his\r\nfavour, promoted them into insects. Now, however, but little distinction\r\nseems to be drawn between cicadas and crickets, or grasshoppers, and,\r\nindeed, this was to some extent the case in classical times—the three\r\noften figuring together on ancient coins or rings. Amongst all of\r\nthese—and together they supply a number of species—the greatest\r\nfavourite with the Tuscan peasant of to-day—as perhaps it was in days\r\nlong gone by—is a beautiful grey-green grasshopper, which the Americans\r\nwould call a Katydid, but is, here, the cavalletta. This insect is\r\nlooked upon as the special patron of children, upon whom it has the\r\npower of conferring musical and poetic genius, as well as more general\r\nmental endowments. To perform this properly, however, it must enter the\r\nroom where its little favourite lies asleep, and this it seems often to\r\ndo. The mother, should she see it, has her own part to play in the\r\nmatter, which she does by tying the beneficent insect, by a long thread,\r\nto the bed-post, and chanting the following verses, with the idea,\r\nprobably, that “then the charm is firm and good.”\r\n\r\n                  “Cavalletta, good and fair,\r\n                   You bring good fortune everywhere,\r\n                   Then since into this house you’ve come,\r\n                   Oh, bring good fortune to our home,\r\n                   Unto me and everyone,\r\n                   But bring it mostly to my son.\r\n                   Cavalletta, this I pray,\r\n                   Bring, and do not take away.\r\n                   In life you were a lady, full\r\n                   Of talent, good, and beautiful,\r\n                   Let me pray, as this is true,\r\n                   You’ll give my child some talent too.\r\n                   And when you fly from east to west,\r\n                   May you, in turn, be truly blest,\r\n                   For though an insect form you bear,\r\n                   You’re still a spirit good and fair.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A LUCK-BRINGING GRASSHOPPER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    In Tuscany, if this insect comes into a child’s room whilst\r\n      asleep, it is the mother’s duty to attach the grasshopper by\r\n      a thread to the child’s bed to bring good fortune. The\r\n      grasshopper is shown in the right-hand corner.\r\n\r\nAs the child grows older, and learns to talk, he is instructed in the\r\ntruth of the matter, and taught by heart the following verses, which he\r\nmust repeat whenever he sees a Cavalletta:—\r\n\r\n                   “I am but little, as you see,\r\n                    But yet I may a genius be;\r\n                    And if, when grown, I shall be great\r\n                    And make a name in Church and State,\r\n                    I’ll not forget that one fine day,\r\n                    As I in cradle sleeping lay,\r\n                    A Cavalletta blessed me there,\r\n                    In answer to my mother’s prayer.”[34]\r\n\r\nWe are not told what happens to the Cavalletta that has been tied up,\r\nafter “the charm’s wound up.” The proper thing for the mother to do\r\nwould certainly be to let it go, but I can’t help thinking that what she\r\nreally does do is to put her foot on it, under the idea that only that\r\ncan make the thing quite certain. That would be so like the peasantry—of\r\nany country.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 32:\r\n\r\n  Leland O.

Since, however, Mr. George Bowdler Buckton, F.R.S.,\r\nhas written a monograph of the British _Cicadæ_, or _Tettigidæ_, in two\r\nvolumes, each of which has a number of plates giving figures of the\r\nvarious species, all with their Latin names, there would seem to be a\r\nconflict of learned opinion; and I, for my part—since one of these\r\nspecies has relations with a nice little parasite which I should like to\r\ndescribe—am of opinion, after profound investigation and impartial\r\nweighing of the evidence on both sides, that Mr. Buckton is right. What\r\nstrikes one at first sight as curious is that numbers of creatures, as\r\nlarge sometimes as humble bees, or larger, and of very striking\r\nappearance—often quite brilliantly coloured—should for so long have\r\nescaped observation; for certainly one has never seen them oneself, and,\r\non making inquiries, one soon finds that nobody else has. But there is\r\nan explanation of this seeming miracle, and that of a not very\r\nsatisfactory nature. One may have noticed, whilst going through the\r\nplates, that in the neighbourhood of each striking figure there are two\r\nlittle irrelevant-looking black lines, drawn soft and fine, very\r\nunobtrusive, looking as though they wished to elude observation; and\r\ngradually it begins to dawn upon you that these lines represent the real\r\nsize in linear measurement of the very salient, _outré_-looking creature\r\nyou are looking at. This, then, is the key to the mystery. England is\r\nfull of cicadas, but they are all so small that nobody can see them—at\r\nleast without taking some trouble. So our poets have been silent, our\r\nphilosophers have made no reflections, and our ploughmen, to this day,\r\nare without a proper objective for those appreciative perceptions of\r\nlife around them which, if it only existed, there might be some evidence\r\nof their possessing. Our aristocracy too, or old county families, have\r\nnever been able to “think gold of themselves,” as the saying is, on\r\naccount of their golden tettix-pins, though the feeling itself has not\r\nbeen entirely denied them. In a word, our national character has been\r\nuninfluenced by cicadas, and, on this, two questions arise: first—for it\r\nis no use to start on an assumption—whether faults exist in it, and\r\nthen, if they do, whether all or any of them are due to this cause. But\r\nsuch matters are for the historian to deal with, and would be out of\r\nplace in the pages of a work like this.\r\n\r\nThough cicadas are so small in England—whilst their voices, if they have\r\nany, as there seems no particular reason to doubt, are too attenuated to\r\nbe audible to our human ears—yet they are not quite invisible. When\r\nseen, however, they are known by some other name, such as frog-hoppers,\r\ntree-hoppers, or the like. Some of these, in their larval stage, which\r\nmuch resembles the adult, take a great deal of pains to conceal\r\nthemselves, though in this they have another reason than that of wishing\r\nto elude observation. Our common cuckoo-spit is a good instance of this,\r\nand also of how a wrong explanation of a common and easily observed\r\nphenomenon may for a long time be given, not only in popular works, but\r\nalso in scientific text-books or monographs, or within the supposedly\r\nup-to-date pages of various encyclopædias. The cuckoo-spit, as everyone\r\nknows, sits in the midst of a little bower of froth (allied to that\r\nother of bliss perhaps) which, on being examined, resolves itself into\r\nan accumulation of bubbles, having a somewhat sticky consistency. We had\r\nalways been told—and still are now very often, though the contrary has\r\nbeen well made out—that these bubbles proceeded from the insect itself,\r\nafter the manner of any other secretion. But this is not the case. The\r\nsecretion here is only a clear fluid, and into this the insect\r\nafterwards blows bubbles by a mechanical process, and through the\r\naddition of air. It is Professor E. S. Morse who, in the pages of\r\n_Appleton’s Popular Scientific Monthly_,[35] has thus revolutionised all\r\nour ideas on this subject. His account is as follows: “The so-called\r\nfrog-spittle or cuckoo-spit appears as little flecks of froth on grass,\r\nbuttercups, and many other plants during the early summer. Immersed in\r\nthis froth is found a little green insect, sometimes two or three of\r\nthem concealed by the same moist covering. This little creature\r\nrepresents the early stage of an insect which, in its full growth, still\r\nlives upon grass, and is easily recognised by its triangular shape and\r\nits ability of jumping like a grasshopper.”\r\n\r\n“If the insect is cleared from the mass of froth it will crawl quite\r\nrapidly along the stem of the plant, stopping, at times, to pierce the\r\nstem for the purpose of sucking the juices within, and finally settling\r\ndown in earnest, clutching the stem with its legs. After sucking for\r\nsome time, a clear fluid is seen to exude from the end of the abdomen,\r\nflowing over the body first, and gradually filling up the spaces between\r\nthe legs and the lower part of the body and the stem upon which it\r\nrests. During all this time not a trace of an air-bubble appears; simply\r\na clear, slightly viscid fluid is exuded, and this is the only matter\r\nthat escapes from the insect. This state of partial immersion continues\r\nfor an hour or more. During this time, and even when walking, the\r\nposterior segments of the insect’s abdomen are extended at intervals,\r\nthe abdomen turning upwards at the same time. It is a kind of\r\nreaching-up movement, but whether this action accompanies a discharge of\r\nfluid, or is an attempt at reaching for air, I have not ascertained.\r\nSuddenly the insect begins to make bubbles by turning its tail out of\r\nthe fluid, opening the posterior segment, and grasping, as with a pair\r\nof claspers, a moiety of air, then turning the tail down into the fluid,\r\nagain, and instantly allowing the enclosed air to escape. These\r\nmovements go on at the rate of seventy or eighty times a minute. The\r\ntail is moved alternately to the right and left in perfect rhythm, so\r\nthat the bubbles are distributed on both sides of the body, and these\r\nare crowded towards the head, till the entire fluid is filled with\r\nbubbles, and the froth thus made runs over the back and around the stem.\r\nIn half a minute some thirty or forty bubbles are made in this way—a\r\nbulk of air two or three times exceeding that of the body—without the\r\nslightest diminution in the size of the body.”\r\n\r\nIt seems clear, therefore, that the air which is put to this purpose is\r\nabstracted directly from the atmosphere, and that neither it nor the\r\nbubbles manufactured through it have ever been within the body of the\r\ninsect. Moreover, if the little bubble-maker be thoroughly dried—which,\r\naccording to Professor Morse, is a matter of difficulty—it will continue\r\nto secrete such spare fluid as it still has, but not the tiniest bubble\r\nis seen to issue with this. If set in a drop of water it struggles to\r\nthe surface, and then goes through the same process of blowing bubbles\r\nas it has done when immersed in fluid of its own distilling. The result,\r\nhowever, is not the same, for the water will not hold the bubbles, which\r\nconstantly disappear. Such, then, is the manner in which the frothy pool\r\nis made. What purposes does it answer? That of a pond, apparently, for\r\nit would appear that in their larval state these little frog-, or\r\ntree-hoppers, are to some extent aquatic insects. If kept dry and not\r\nallowed to renew their supply of fluid, their body shrivels, and before\r\nlong they die. This is not through suffocation, since they can breathe\r\nair, by means of spiracles, in the ordinary way. If, however, they are\r\nexamined closely, certain leaf-like appendages may be detected upon each\r\nside of the seventh and eighth segments of the abdomen, and Professor\r\nMorse suggests that these may be of the nature of branchiæ, or gills,\r\nenabling the insect to breathe, also, in water or fluid, by abstracting\r\nthe air from it, after the manner of a fish, as some other aquatic larvæ\r\ndo. “As many of these,” he says, “respire in two ways, either inhaling\r\nair through the spiracles, or by means of branchial leaflets, so\r\n_Aphrophora_ (for that is the classic name of our insect) may likewise\r\nutilise its branchial tufts for the same purpose. Thus we may see the\r\nreason for this bubble-blowing, since each fresh bubble added to the\r\nmass may aerate the fluid, so to speak, and thus secure at intervals a\r\nfresh supply of oxygen.”[36]\r\n\r\nIn early spring, if one examines the leaf-buds of rose trees, which now\r\nbegin to swell, one may often see tiny little black specks, like grains\r\nof gunpowder, scattered over their surface, especially within any fold\r\nor crevice which it presents. These are the eggs of the Aphides, insects\r\nwhich, if not cicadas, are not so very far removed from them, and which,\r\nlooked at from various points of view, are extremely interesting little\r\ncreatures. One of these points of view, which we may conveniently start\r\nfrom, is their extraordinary rate of increase, which exceeds even that\r\nof the Chinese. “A single insect,” says Mr. Buckton, “hatched from one\r\nof these shining black ova may be the mother of many billions of young,\r\neven during her lifetime. Réaumur calculated that one Aphis may be the\r\nmother of the enormous number of 5,904,900,000 individuals during the\r\nmonth or six weeks of her existence. But neither Tongard nor Morren is\r\nsatisfied with this estimate, both declaring that quintillions are\r\nwithin the capabilities of a single mother’s efforts. Professor Huxley\r\n(who, by the way, was not interested in the alleged phenomena of\r\nspiritualism, _even if true_) makes a curious calculation which, at any\r\nrate, affords some approximate idea of what a quintillion of Aphides\r\nmight mean. Assuming that an Aphis weighs as little as one-thousandth of\r\na grain (which is less than I should ever have thought), and that it\r\nrequires a man to be very stout to weigh more than two million grains,\r\nhe shows that the tenth brood of Aphides alone, without adding the\r\nproduct of all the generations which precede the tenth, if all the\r\nmembers survive the perils to which they are exposed, contains more\r\nponderable substance than 500,000,000 of stout men: that is, more than\r\nthe whole population of China.”[37] This, it appears, is an\r\nunder-estimate, which is rather annoying, for one would like to call it\r\na gross exaggeration. But facts are facts—in whatever degree they may\r\ninterest one—and it is impossible not to feel respect for an insect like\r\nthis, especially in these days, when the diminished returns of the\r\ncensus are beginning to cause alarm as to the future destinies even of\r\nour own once proudly fecund race. It is a wonderful record for a single\r\nindividual—to have weighed down China—and when Mr. Buckton remarks that\r\nfacts like these regarding the prolific nature of Aphides “afford\r\nsufficient explanation of the occurrence of the extraordinary swarms so\r\noften noticed by authors,”[37] nobody is likely to disagree with him.\r\nWith billions a certainty, and quintillions in the air, swarms seem\r\namply accounted for.\r\n\r\nOne of the authors here alluded to is our homely immortal, White of\r\nSelborne. “I shall here mention,” he says, “an emigration of small\r\nAphides, which was observed in the village of Selborne no longer ago\r\nthan August 1st, 1785. At about three o’clock in the afternoon of that\r\nday, which was very hot, the people of this village were surprised by a\r\nshower of Aphides, or smother-flies, which fell in these parts. Those\r\nthat were walking in the streets at that juncture found themselves\r\ncovered with these insects, which settled, also, on the hedges and\r\ngardens, blackening all the vegetables where they alighted. My annuals\r\nwere discoloured with them, and the stalks of a bed of onions were quite\r\ncoated over for six days after. These armies were then, no doubt, in a\r\nstate of emigration and shifting their quarters; and might have come, as\r\nfar as we know, from the great hop-plantations of Kent or Sussex, the\r\nwind being, all that day, in the easterly quarter. They were observed,\r\nat the same time, in great clouds about Farnham, and all along the vale\r\nfrom Farnham to Alton.”[38]\r\n\r\nOther great migrations of Aphides have at various times been observed.\r\nIn the autumn of 1834 the city of Gand was invaded, and, one may almost\r\nsay, taken by a vast army of them, and at Bruges and Antwerp the same\r\nswarm is said to have darkened the sun,[39] a result of such gatherings\r\nmore noticeable elsewhere than in England, since our sun usually is\r\ndarkened. Insects, though their movements are not so regular, nor, as a\r\nrule, so noticeable as those of birds, yet often migrate—how often or\r\nhow regularly it is difficult to say. Locusts are, of course, the stock\r\nexample as well as the most terrific one, but perhaps dragon-flies, were\r\nthey as destructive, would have been as much noted in this connexion.\r\nTheir migrations seem to be tolerably frequent, and a record of them\r\nbetween 1494 and 1868 has been published by Koppen, a German\r\nentomologist. In 1881 a great flight of them took place in Illinois.\r\n“The air,” we are told, “for miles around seemed literally alive with\r\nthese dragon-flies, from a foot above ground to as far as eye could\r\nreach, all flying in the same direction, a south-westerly course, and\r\nthe few that would occasionally cross the track of the majority could\r\nall the more easily be noticed from the very regular and swift course\r\nthey generally pursued; but even these few stray ones would soon fall in\r\nwith the rest again. Very few were seen alighting and all carefully\r\navoided any movable obstacles.”[40] This migration took place during a\r\nvery dry season, and may have been caused by it owing to the drying up\r\nof swamps, ponds, etc., in which the insects would otherwise have laid\r\ntheir eggs, obliging them to seek other suitable places.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1900 a great migration of dragon-flies was observed in\r\nBelgium. “All the observers agree that the insects flew rather low, with\r\nastonishing regularity, and without resting; that they kept close to the\r\nearth, where there were no obstacles, but that they mounted to a height\r\nof 10 to 12 mètres when houses or trees were in the way. They did not go\r\nround obstacles in their line of route, but surmounted them, and\r\ndescended on the other side. According to some observers, their flight\r\nwas very slow, others again asserting that it was very swift. When the\r\nvelocity could be estimated, however, it was found to be at 5 mètres per\r\nsecond or 18 kilometres (11¼ miles) per hour (so that the slows have\r\nit). In general they went in groups, more or less isolated, and more or\r\nless dense.” The writer of the above account—a Belgian—concludes thus:\r\n“All the facts point to the following conclusions: The dragon-flies of\r\nthe 5th came from regions situated to the east of the country, which\r\nthey entered in several columns, flying at a great altitude: between 7\r\nand 8 a.m. they descended towards the earth, continuing their route\r\ntowards the west. But we remain in ignorance of their point of\r\ndeparture. The swarm probably quitted its usual habitation early in the\r\nmorning, and immediately flew to a great height. It was only on arriving\r\nnear the earth that they flew against the wind”[41] (which, however,\r\nthey then continued to do).\r\n\r\nWhat Mr. Hudson calls “dragon-fly storms” are a special phenomenon of\r\nthe Pampas. In this case the cause of the migration—for such movements\r\nseem to come under this heading—is a special wind called the _pampero_,\r\nthat blows south-west from the interior of the Pampas. It is very\r\nviolent, cold, and dry, and the dragon-flies evidently fear it. The\r\n“storm” is thus described by Mr. Hudson: “It is in summer and autumn\r\nthat the large dragon-flies appear; not _with_ the wind, but—and this is\r\nthe most curious part of the matter—in advance of it; and inasmuch as\r\nthese insects are not seen in the country at other times, and frequently\r\nappear in seasons of prolonged drought, when all the marshes and\r\nwatercourses for many hundreds of miles are dry, they must, of course,\r\ntraverse immense distances, flying before the wind at a speed of 70 or\r\n80 miles an hour. On some occasions they appear almost simultaneously\r\nwith the wind, going by like a flash, and instantly disappearing from\r\nsight. You have scarcely time to see them before the wind strikes you.\r\nAs a rule, however, they make their appearance from 5 to 15 minutes\r\nbefore the wind strikes; and when they are in great numbers, the air, to\r\na height of 10 or 12 feet above the surface of the ground, is all at\r\nonce seen to be full of them, rushing past with extraordinary velocity\r\nin a north-easterly direction. In very oppressive weather, and when the\r\nswiftly advancing _pampero_ brings no moving mountains of mingled cloud\r\nand dust, and is, consequently, not expected, the sudden apparition of\r\nthe dragon-fly is a most welcome one, for then an immediate burst of\r\ncold wind is confidently looked for. In the expressive vernacular of the\r\ngauchos the large dragon-fly is called ‘_hijo del pampero_,’ son of the\r\nsouth-west wind.”[42]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 35:\r\n\r\n  Vol. 57.\r\n\r\nFootnote 36:\r\n\r\n  Appleton’s Popular Scientific Monthly, vol. v.\r\n\r\nFootnote 37:\r\n\r\n  Buckton, Monograph of the British Cicadæ or Tettigidæ.\r\n\r\nFootnote 38:\r\n\r\n  White’s Natural History of Selborne, Letter liii. p. 283 (stereotyped\r\n  edition).\r\n\r\nFootnote 39:\r\n\r\n  Buckton, Monograph of the British Cicadæ or Tettigidæ.\r\n\r\nFootnote 40:\r\n\r\n  Leland O.

Were all of these, or perhaps were any one of them,\r\nentirely removed, the whole world apparently might find itself deep\r\nburied beneath a “star-y-pointing pyramid” of insect organisms, for what\r\ncannot quintillions, in the hands of a competent mathematician, achieve?\r\nThe wonder certainly seems that any kind of check should be sufficient.\r\nWe owe our safety, in part, as might have been surmised, to a small\r\nIchneumon Fly, the traces of whose work may generally be seen in a\r\nnumber of brown lifeless corpses, which are dotted about like so many\r\nskeletons at the feast, amongst any collection of living Aphides. These,\r\nif examined more closely, are seen to be mere empty sacs, each one\r\nhaving at some part of it a quite circular aperture, through which the\r\nissuing guest has escaped. But the amount of the good thus effected is\r\nnot to be estimated by the number of these shells, these nests from\r\nwhich the bird has flown. Such are only in the last stage of things,\r\nwhilst almost all, including the healthiest-looking of the living\r\nAphides, are probably travelling along the same road, to arrive at the\r\nsame goal. All, or almost all, have within them a guest whose energies\r\nare unceasingly devoted to absorbing the whole of their interior\r\narrangements into itself, and gradually taking their place. “In June,”\r\nsays Mr. Buckton, “during the hot weather, I have seen, at the same\r\ntime, as many as three of these flies on one rose sprig, each poised on\r\nthe back of an Aphis, which throws itself into many contortions for the\r\npurpose of throwing off its enemy. The Ichneumon, however, remains fixed\r\non the back for ten or more minutes (as though enjoying the situation)\r\nbefore the ovipositor is thrust under the skin of the victim and the egg\r\nis laid. The Aphis appears to suffer at first but little, since it soon\r\nresumes its occupation of pumping up the sap. A worm-like, or more\r\ncommonly, a maggot-like creature, according to the species of the\r\nparasite, hatches from this egg, which revels in the organised\r\nnutritious fluid elaborated by the Aphis. The greater part of the\r\nabdomen is occupied by this maggot when it becomes full fed, and then it\r\nmay often be seen through the transparent integument, as a grub curled\r\ninto a semicircle. Finally, the Aphis dies, the grub ceases to feed, and\r\nafter a certain period of rest cuts out of the roof of its prison a\r\ncircular plate, like a trap-door, as regular in form as if a carpenter’s\r\ncentre-bit had been used. The emerging fly has four wings, long antennæ\r\ncomposed of numerous joints, a wasp-like body and legs, and is in every\r\nway suited for its marauding expeditions.”[43]\r\n\r\nOther and more interesting dramas can take place within the body of an\r\nAphis; wheels within wheels, one masterpiece of economic contrivance\r\nenclosing another, perfection more perfected. Along what path, indeed,\r\ncan the beauty and wisdom of Nature—those endless steps from endless\r\nseeming halting-places that become, when reached, but so many points of\r\nfresh departure—be run to earth, so to speak? The brain becomes, at\r\nlast, almost weary in the pursuit of wisdom’s ways, and even the\r\ndelighted spirit would fain cry, “Hold! Enough!” Thoughts like these are\r\npowerfully excited by the following picture.\r\n\r\nIt is spring, early spring, and already the young Aphides have begun,\r\nwith gladness born of the opening year, to absorb the sweet sap from the\r\nstems of the immature wheat-crop. Later, however, when July’s sun shines\r\nbrightly behind its cooling screen of clouds—for in England all climatic\r\nextremes are tempered—they ascend in “numbers numberless” to attack the\r\near itself. What, then, can save the hope of the husbandman? What but\r\n_Ephedrus plagiator_, a small black-winged Ichneumon Fly that even now\r\nis at work? As each individual Aphis clings to the wheat, it becomes, in\r\nspite of its efforts to fill itself, hollower and hollower; its appetite\r\nflags, and ere it can fatally affect the plant on which man’s life and\r\nthe machinations of the protectionist depend, it has become a mere brown\r\npupa-case for a body other than its own to develop in. A day or two, and\r\nalmost on every grain of the wheat hangs an insect, lifeless, but—oh,\r\nfloweret springing from the tomb!—life-filled. Hardly a living Aphis is\r\nto be seen feeding amongst them. The wheat-crop has been saved. But the\r\nmarch of events, thus unfolded, does not end here. Another drama has to\r\nbe played out ere the full life issues from the once living cradle whose\r\ncontents it has absorbed and become, nor will it bear the image of that\r\nparticular Ichneumon Fly that laid its little egg, some weeks ago, in\r\nthe body that seemed so designed for it. Like the Aphis, the Ichneumon,\r\ntoo, must learn to live for others, thus rising through selfishness to a\r\npurer and higher embodiment. If we pass a little later through the same\r\ncornfield, another insect, differing from, yet of the same general type\r\nas the prior parasite, may be seen running to and fro over the\r\nwheat-ears, tapping each tenanted abode with tremulously quivering\r\nantennæ, which, as well as the whole body, seem to vibrate with\r\nexcitement. It is looking for lodgings, but not every house so touched\r\ncan be utilised, for _Ceraphrus Carpenteri_—such is the new tenant’s\r\nname—must first be satisfied that none of its own species have already\r\ntaken possession. Once assured on this point, however, its duty lies\r\nplain before it, and bending its antennæ against the wheat-ear, so as to\r\nform a fulcrum, it turns the tip of its abdomen towards that of the dead\r\nAphis, and with its ovipositor commences to saw through the skin. As\r\nmuch as ten minutes may be occupied in the accomplishment of this task,\r\nfor the sarcophagus that has thus to be pierced is hard, and the\r\novipositor, though short, is not stout, but slenderly formed. But there\r\nis no flagging of energy, and at length, when efforts steadily continued\r\nhave been crowned with success, the same deft instrument is again\r\nemployed to pierce the sleeping _ephedrus_, and a second egg is\r\ndeposited in this second cradle. To this new tenant the former one must\r\nnow yield up the juices of its body, even as those of the Aphis were\r\nfreely rendered unto it. It must die in its turn, but by its death\r\nanother lives, and thus the physical act of aggression, which we call\r\nselfishness, becomes the seed-bed, as it were, or forcing-house—the\r\nfood-plant, to use an entomological simile—of a moral altruism. True,\r\nthe Aphis may at first struggle, the maggot, pierced by the ovipositor,\r\nmay flinch for a moment, but after that there is complete passivity,\r\nwithout which there can be no complete acquiescence. Self-absorption,\r\nthat is the moral of it all; for the true self of the Aphis, which is\r\nnot represented by the outer husk, is absorbed into the Ichneumon, and\r\nso in regard to the latter. Thus, throughout the animal kingdom we must\r\nlook to the inner, and not to the outer, significance. What matters it,\r\nthough Nature be “red in tooth and claw,” if the fierce rendings of the\r\nouter integuments are but as the first gropings towards interior rest\r\nand calm? And should we not, in the lower walks of life, look to the\r\nsoul through the body, and see in processes which, with ourselves, might\r\nseem to represent the flesh only, a blending which but anticipates the\r\nmore complete separation? Thus, and thus only, as it appears to me, can\r\nwe impart beauty to a scheme which, without this key, must appear\r\nselfish and unsatisfactory. The key may be hard to find, but when we\r\nonce hold it we need no longer repine.\r\n\r\nBesides the Wheat Aphis, which but for such arrangements as have here\r\nbeen glanced at, would almost deprive us of bread, we have the Hop\r\nAphis, a species the dread of which is still more strongly disseminated\r\namongst the masses of this country, inasmuch as its interference would\r\nbe with the supply of beer. No wonder, then, that the little ladybird is\r\nbeloved by all, since, but for its efforts, many a poor man might have\r\nto live in a state of enforced sobriety, which, in its turn, must\r\ndeleteriously affect that position of respect and esteem which many\r\nillustrious and highly placed individuals now hold in the hearts of the\r\npeople, so that a general disturbal of habits and ideas, amounting\r\nalmost to moral chaos, would attend any serious diminution in the\r\nnumbers of this insect, England’s true guardian angel. But it were\r\nunjust to claim an undue share in the merit of recognising work like\r\nthis. Appreciation of such services is, as one might expect, widely\r\nspread, and is expressed in such popular names as, for instance, in\r\nLombardy “Bestioline del Signore,” in Tuscany “Madonnine” or\r\n“Marioline,” in France “Bête” or “Vache à Dieu,” and in Germany\r\n“Sonnenkäfer.” The first-named countries, indeed, are not, or used not\r\nto be, beer-drinking, so that unless this little madonna is a patroness\r\nof the vine too, they are not so easy to understand. It may, however, be\r\nincidentally mentioned that the ladybirds are good friends to the\r\norchards, and destroy many thousands of apple- or plum-eating Aphides.\r\n\r\nAphides, in fact, of some kind or other, are what they have come into\r\nthe world to destroy. It is their mission, their epos.\r\n\r\nThe following account of the habits of these beneficent creatures,\r\nprincipally in the above connection, is given by Mr. Buckton, a profound\r\nstudent of insect life-histories: “The food of Coccinella (the ladybird)\r\nconsists almost exclusively of Aphides. Their marvellous voracity is\r\nshown equally in their larval and their winged condition. The former\r\nstage may be commonly seen throughout early summer as slaty-grey or\r\nbrown six-footed creatures, covered with tufted tubercles, and provided\r\nwith mandibles efficient both for holding and sucking out the juices of\r\ntheir victims. In some years the imagos (or grown insects) are\r\nwonderfully numerous, and when they take wing form vast swarms which\r\ntravel great distances. In the year 1869 such a cloud passed over a\r\nlarge part of Kent, Sussex, and Surrey,” and their effect (of the same\r\ngenial nature as that of Bacchus wandering through the earth) was soon\r\nseen in the good hop crop of the following year. “Although the\r\nCoccinella is not restricted to the Hop Aphis for its food, it\r\nfrequently follows its migrations, and travels on the same winds. Whilst\r\nfeeding, the Aphis is held and manipulated by the jaws or palpi of the\r\nCoccinella, and the devouring operation proceeds amidst the struggles of\r\nthe victims from the apex of the abdomen to the thorax, which parts,\r\ntogether with the head and legs, are finally rejected.”[43] This\r\nprocess—which is by no means confined to insect life, but extends\r\nupwards from it even into the highly organised mammalia—does not seem to\r\nbe a pleasant one to witness, for Mr. Buckton remarks upon it: “We may\r\nexpress some hope, in sympathy with the Aphis, that the automatic theory\r\nof animal life may here find some place, and that reflex action may\r\nexplain the fact that, under the microscope, the mutilated remains of\r\nthe Aphis, without stomach and without internal organs, have been seen\r\nto walk away and live after the operation for a considerable time!\r\nAutomatically the Coccinella furbishes up its jaws and antennæ in\r\nreadiness for another meal. From thirty to forty Aphides may thus be\r\nconsumed in one hour.”[43]\r\n\r\nAutomatically perhaps—that is to say, between the lines—we may gather\r\nMr. Buckton’s opinion of the automatic theory. There are some theories\r\nwhich seem held, like dykes or barriers, to prevent the sea from getting\r\nin. One doesn’t want the sea to get in, because it would swamp such a\r\nlot of things, which, although quite artificial, one is not prepared to\r\npart with, but one doesn’t believe in the barrier except for that\r\nparticular purpose to which it is applied. The automatic theory in\r\nregard to animals is a case in point. Scientific men make use of it in\r\norder to keep out another, which they don’t want to have to admit,\r\nthough they do, as a fact, believe in it. This, again, one can read\r\nbetween the lines whenever they give any account of their observations\r\non this or that animal, whether it be dog or elephant, ants or something\r\nmuch lower down in the scale—rotifers, for instance, or amœba in the\r\nocean of a watch-glass. One sees what they really mean very well then,\r\nthough they may not themselves be aware of it, but they are never in the\r\nleast _convincing_ when they air their automatic theory. Aphides, as may\r\nhave been gathered incidentally, feed wholly upon the juices or sap of\r\nplants. Active _ab ovo_ (which means from the egg), “their occupation,”\r\nsays Mr. Buckton, “is to grow as fast as possible,” and with a view to\r\nthis end the rostrum or beak, with its enclosed sucking or pumping\r\napparatus, is fully developed from the very commencement, “often,\r\nindeed, to such an abnormal extent that it forms an awkward appendage,\r\ntrailing behind the body whilst walking.”[43] The insect does not,\r\nhowever, walk much, but, settling itself down on the twig or stem where,\r\nperhaps, it first saw the light, pierces the bark with the instrument\r\nthus provided for it, and commences to suck up the sap into its mouth.\r\nThis is not a process which can be indulged in with impunity to the\r\nplant, especially since Aphides reside in great societies upon the same\r\none, and turn their attention to every part of it, not even excepting\r\nthe roots. Troops of small Aphides, in fact, have sometimes been found\r\nin the pips of large codling apples. In consequence of this excessive\r\ndrain upon their fluids, which is as though our own blood were to be\r\nsucked, plants thus invaded by Aphides become greatly weakened, and\r\ntheir young shoots and leaves have a distorted appearance in\r\nconsequence. Others, either through this cause alone, or in consequence\r\nof some poison or acid injected by the Aphis, have gall-like excresences\r\nproduced upon them. These have a hollow interior, into which the Aphides\r\npenetrate, and there take up their residence. Such swellings thus become\r\ntheir houses, and therefore, since it is a great advantage to the\r\nAphides to be sheltered in this way, it is possible that some special\r\ninstinct through the exercise of which the tree is thus affected, may\r\nhave been implanted in them by the action of natural selection.\r\n\r\nAphides are often spoken of by entomologists as if a very high degree of\r\ninterest attached to them, and, no doubt, in many respects this is the\r\ncase. As we have seen, they exhibit certain phenomena of _corporealism_\r\n(which _did_ interest Professor Huxley) to a greater extent perhaps than\r\nany other creature, though of this I am not at all sure; but after all\r\none soon gets over the wonder of that, especially since there is no\r\nrealising it, and then it does not seem to raise a creature to a very\r\nhigh level of interest. Again, to quote authority, “there is a most\r\ncurious alternation of broods in these insects, some forms being winged\r\nand with separate sexes, and others wingless or apterous and capable of\r\nproducing their kind for an indefinite number of generations before a\r\nsexual brood is again developed. In fact, the anomalies of members of\r\nthis family are endless, and it would require volumes to epitomise even\r\nthe comparatively little which has already been discovered with\r\nreference to their habits and transformations.”[44] Still, for all this,\r\nit is difficult to look long at an Aphis, or a collection of Aphides\r\nupon a rose tree or any other of the plants they affect, without getting\r\nheartily tired of them, and for me, as perhaps for most people, the\r\nprincipal interest about these sluggish creatures lies in the relations\r\nwhich have become established, without any intelligent efforts on their\r\nown part, between them and ants—but it will be best to reserve the\r\ndiscussion of this subject for the following chapter.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 43:\r\n\r\n  Buckton, Monograph of the British Aphides, vol. i\r\n\r\nFootnote 44:\r\n\r\n  The Concise Knowledge Library, Natural History, pp. 601, 602.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ants and their honey-cows—A mutual benefit—Unity of motive—The\r\n      end and the means—Two ways of getting honey—Insect\r\n      cattle—Wasps as cow-milkers—A cow-keeping bee—Ant\r\n      cow-sheds—Aphides in ants’ nests—Children of light and\r\n      darkness—Forethought extraordinary.\r\n\r\nA drop of honey, or something like it, is the connecting bond between\r\nthe ant and the Aphis.

This honey, or honey-dew, to use the more\r\nspecial name bestowed on it, the ants want, but they are not content\r\nwith drinking it whenever it issues from its manufacturers, in natural\r\ncourse. This is not sufficient, and they have learned to increase the\r\nflow of so valued a beverage by their own efforts—in other words, they\r\nmilk the Aphides, which thus become their cows. To do this they tap them\r\nwith their antennæ, softly and gently, on the sides of the abdomen—a\r\nquick little shower of touches. Under the influence of this probably\r\npleasant sensation the Aphis becomes willing to part, and, raising the\r\nabdomen, “teems her refreshing dew” in a drop from the tip of it. This\r\naction of the ants cannot, in Europe, be successfully imitated, at least\r\nit has not been, and if an ant is not forthcoming the fluid is contained\r\nin the body of the Aphis until necessity compels its being ejected.\r\nProbably the ants, if delayed in their visits, are missed by the\r\nAphides, as a cow misses her milker, and long before they do excrete, as\r\nthe process is called, they would perhaps have done so had they felt\r\nable. The sensation no doubt of the ant’s antennæ on the abdomen has\r\nbecome, through usage, the almost necessary stimulus to the act produced\r\nby it.\r\n\r\nThe above remarks are best illustrated by a quotation from Darwin,\r\nwhich, in my opinion, should always be given in any general account of\r\nthe relations of ants and Aphides. “I removed,” says Darwin, “all the\r\nants from a group of about a dozen Aphides on a dock plant, and\r\nprevented their attendance during several hours. After this interval I\r\nfelt sure that the Aphides would want to excrete. I watched them for\r\nsome time through a lens, but not one excreted. I then tickled and\r\nstroked them with a hair in the same manner, as well as I could, as the\r\nants do with their antennæ; but not one excreted. Afterwards I allowed\r\nan ant to visit them, and it immediately seemed, by its eager way of\r\nrunning about, to be well aware what a rich flock it had discovered; it\r\nthen began to play with its antennæ on the abdomen first of one Aphis\r\nand then of another; and each, as soon as it felt the antennæ, lifted up\r\nits abdomen and excreted a limpid drop of sweet juice, which was eagerly\r\ndevoured by the ant. Even the quite young Aphides behaved in this\r\nmanner, showing that the action was instinctive, and not the result of\r\nexperience. It is certain, from the observations of Huber, that the\r\nAphides show no dislike to the ants: if the latter be not present, they\r\nare at last compelled to eject their excretion. But, as the excretion is\r\nextremely viscid it is no doubt a convenience to the Aphides to have it\r\nremoved; therefore, probably, they do not excrete solely for the good of\r\nthe ants.”[45]\r\n\r\nIf the reverse of this were the case, if the Aphides did excrete for the\r\nsole benefit of the ants, then, in Darwin’s own opinion, the case for\r\nnatural selection would be broken down, and with this there would be\r\nsome better ground of reason for those who would see in relations of\r\nthis sort a set-off, as it were, against the never-ending bloodshed and\r\nrapine, accompanied with suffering in varied—often in an intense—degree,\r\nwhich is the very stuff out of which Nature has woven her mantle. But\r\nthere can be no essential difference where the principle at work is\r\nprecisely the same. So long as a creature does benefit itself, the way\r\nin which it does it, and the incidental effects of its doing so, are of\r\nno consequence; it is the motive power that the philosopher has to\r\nconsider, and there is little comfort—if comfort be needed—in knowing\r\nthat an animal, to do itself good, is doing good to some other, when one\r\nalso knows that, governed by the same incentive, it would as cheerfully\r\nprey upon that other’s eye. As Hamlet says, in such a case “the\r\nreadiness is all.”\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of this truth here is another picture of how ants\r\nprocure honey from a weaker creature that may happen to have swallowed\r\nit, when it is not to be obtained by the soft methods of persuasion.\r\n“Once upon a time,” says Dr. Lincecum, “there dwelt in my yard a\r\nflourishing colony of the very smallest species of black ant,” and\r\nhaving described how these Lilliputians found and ate some syrup\r\nbelonging to the household, and were in consequence attacked by a larger\r\nand stronger species, he continues, “They”—that is the attacking\r\nparty—“grabbed up the heavily burdened little fellows, doubled them, and\r\nbiting open the abdomen, drew out the full sac, and seemed to swallow\r\nit. Then, casting the lacerated carcase aside, they furiously sprung\r\nupon another of the panic-stricken crowd and repeated the horrid\r\noperation.”[46] Clearly, then, Nature, so long as she can attain her\r\nend, cares not by what means she attains it.\r\n\r\nIndependently of any feeling of comfort which the Aphides may experience\r\nin being milked by the ants, observation at once shows that they benefit\r\nlargely, in a general way, by the attentions of the latter. It is not\r\nenough for the ants to milk their cows when they happen to meet them.\r\nThey go very much farther than this, and cow-keeping is of as much\r\nimportance with them as with us. Lucky the Aphis who has a guard of ants\r\nround it, fiery warriors prepared to defend their property against all\r\nfoes. None need be feared now. Let but an Ichneumon buzz, and a dozen\r\nstalwarts start to the rescue.\r\n\r\n          “I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.”\r\n\r\n          “Fear not, sweet wench, they shall not touch thee, Kate,\r\n           I’ll buckler thee against a million.”\r\n\r\nAnd so they do indeed, or against any reasonable number. But there is no\r\ncombination amongst these banditti. Each comes but to eat his own Aphis,\r\nand no one thinks of helping a friend. All therefore are powerless\r\nbefore the organised attack of so fierce a bodyguard. Whilst the ants\r\nare with them the Aphides are quite safe, and they are often permanently\r\nguarded in this way. Other ants take even more elaborate precautions for\r\nthe safety of their property, placing them in stalls, where they stand,\r\nby plastering earth, etc., about the plant on which they are feeding.\r\nLastly, others still conduct them into their own nest, where they keep\r\nthem, sometimes, in a chamber specially prepared for their reception,\r\nevery necessary measure being taken for their proper nourishment, and,\r\nas one may say, comfort. Nay, the very eggs of the Aphides are tended by\r\nthe ants, and hatch out in their own nurseries. Nor is it little for\r\nwhich they do all this, since, taking their size into consideration, the\r\nyield of these ant-cows each day must be much greater than that of our\r\nown—at least, I should imagine so.\r\n\r\nIt is not all ants who do these things, nor do any do all of them, but\r\nwhere there are Aphides and also ants, it would seem to be the exception\r\nrather than the rule for the latter to neglect them.\r\n\r\nBut Aphides, though the principal ant-cows of Europe, are not the only\r\nones even there, whilst elsewhere various other species that have this\r\nhoney-excreting property become their substitutes. “In the tropics,”\r\nsays Belt, in his much-observing work, “their place is taken in a great\r\nmeasure by species of _coccidæ_ and genera of _Homoptera_, such as\r\n_Membracis_ and its allies. My pineapples were greatly subject to the\r\nattacks of a small, soft-bodied, brown coccus, that was always guarded\r\nby a little black stinging ant (_Solenopsis_). This ant took great care\r\nof the scale-insects, and attacked savagely any one interfering with\r\nthem, as I often found to my cost when trying to clear my pines by being\r\nstung severely by them. Not content with watching over their cattle, the\r\nants brought up grains of damp earth, and built domed galleries over\r\nthem, in which, under the vigilant guard of their savage little\r\nattendants, the scale insects must, I think, have been secure from the\r\nattacks of all enemies.”[47] And again, the same naturalist tells us,\r\n“The pawpaw trees growing in my garden were infested by a small brown\r\nspecies of _Membracis_—one of the leaf-hoppers that laid its eggs in a\r\ncottony nest on the under part of the leaves. The hopper would stand\r\ncovering the nest until the young were hatched. These were little\r\nsoft-bodied, dark-coloured insects, looking like Aphides, but more\r\nrobust, and with the hind segments turned up. From the end of these the\r\nlittle larvæ exuded drops of honey, and were assiduously attended by\r\nsmall ants belonging to two species of the genus _Pheidole_. A third\r\nant—a species of _Hypoclinea_—which I have mentioned before as a\r\ncowardly species, whenever it found any young hoppers unattended, would\r\nrelieve them of their honey, but would scamper away on the approach of\r\nany of the _Pheidole_. The latter do not sting, but they attack and bite\r\nthe hand if the young hoppers are interfered with.”[47] The latter “are,\r\nwhen young, so soft-bodied and sluggish in their movements, and there\r\nare so many enemies ready to prey upon them, that I imagine that in the\r\ntropics many species would be exterminated if it were not for the\r\nprotection of the ants.”[47]\r\n\r\nBut these leaf-hoppers had not only ants, but wasps to protect them, and\r\nthere were constant skirmishes and bickerings on their account between\r\nthe two. The wasp obtained the honey just in the same way as the\r\nants—namely, by stroking the hoppers with its antennæ, and its\r\npossession of wings, more than its greater size, gave it a clear\r\nadvantage over its rival. It did not grapple with the latter, even when\r\nthere was only a single one to dispute its right, but, rising on the\r\nwing, and hovering about till a good opportunity presented itself, it\r\nwould dart down suddenly on the impertinent little dwarf, and strike it\r\nfrom the leaf or stem. So quick was this action that Mr. Belt could not\r\ndetermine whether it was with the feet or the mandibles that the wasp\r\ndelivered its blow, but he thinks it was with the former; that is to\r\nsay, the front pair of them. But in spite of its superiority in single\r\ncombat, the wasp could not prevail against the numbers of the ants. If,\r\nindeed, it was first in the field, there was not much difficulty, for\r\nthough the leaf would before long be found by some or other of the ants,\r\nyet the first arrivals were only pioneers, and when once they were\r\nknocked off it it had to be found again, only for a similar fate to\r\nbefall the new discoverers. Often, however, the wasp would try to clear\r\na leaf already in possession of the ants, and the way to which was\r\nknown. But in this it was never successful, for though many fell,\r\nstreams of others came rushing up, so that the wasp had no time to enjoy\r\nthe fruits of its labours, but was obliged to keep constantly fighting,\r\nand before long was tired out. Though a giant amongst pigmies, and\r\nhaving wings—a sort of flying-dragon contending with an army of\r\nknights—yet it did not despise its small enemies, and evidently dreaded\r\nlest any of them should succeed in fastening on it. No doubt it\r\nknew—from inheritance, or experience, or both—that an ant clinging to a\r\nleg was a difficult thing to get rid of, and to avoid being placed in\r\nthis position it never fought upon the ground—that is, the leaf—but only\r\non the wing, in the manner described. Had it used its mandibles to bite\r\nwith, the ants would have seized them, and some might have got on its\r\nbody. Its sting played no part, doubtless because the small size and\r\nhard bodies of the ants would have rendered it ineffective.\r\n\r\nWe see from the above account that ants are not the only insects that\r\ncan make discreet use of honey-yielding creatures, though they excel all\r\nothers in this respect. Wasps have also learnt to milk, if not to stall,\r\ntheir kine, and to wasps, it would seem, must be added—which need not\r\nsurprise us—at least one species of bee. A correspondent, whose name and\r\ndate of communication I cannot now remember, says, writing to _Nature_:\r\n“Fritz Muller has observed in Brazil a larva of a leaf-hopper—_Umbonia\r\nindicator_—which is used, like the Aphides by the ants, as milch cattle\r\nby a species of stingless bee—_Trigonia Cagafogo_. This bee is fond of\r\noily matters, and feeds on carrion, old stinking cheese, and oil\r\nsecreted by various plants. Although stingless, it possesses a very\r\nintense venom, which causes a most lively irritation of the skin.” I\r\nwish I could give the details of a fact so interesting, but have not had\r\nthe opportunity of reading the original account from which this bald\r\nstatement is taken. The ants, therefore, have rivals in this industry,\r\nand possibly such rivalry may exist to an extent hitherto unsuspected.\r\n\r\nThough the protection of these insects by the ants architecturally—by\r\nmoist earth placed round them, that is to say—is mentioned in the above\r\naccount, it is not dwelt upon, and seems to play but a small part in the\r\ngeneral drama. Some ants, however, rely solely on this method. Mr.\r\nGaudie, writing in the _Victorian Naturalist_,[48] gives the following\r\naccount of one of these: “A small species of ant, commonly distributed\r\nin the Mallee, has a curious habit of keeping in close confinement a\r\nrather large mealy Aphis, which feeds on the stems of young eucalyptus\r\ngum trees. Round and over these Aphides the ants construct a domed\r\ncovering of particles of bark, grass, etc., which serves the double\r\npurpose of imprisoning the aphides and excluding other ants. Some of\r\nthese coverings appear to be entirely closed, whilst others have an\r\nopening left in the edges. This doorway is, however, constantly guarded\r\nby a pair of ants, which continually move about in the open space, and\r\nseem much impressed with the importance of the duty assigned to them.\r\nEach enclosure contains generally from three to a dozen Aphides, and\r\nabout the same number of ants. Upon making a breach in some of these\r\nstructures for the purpose of observation, I have noticed that many of\r\nthe live stock were immediately seized by the ants and forcibly removed\r\nto a place of safety. The ant under notice is about a quarter of an inch\r\nin length, and is of a uniform dark, reddish-brown colour, and forms its\r\nordinary habitation under logs, or in old rotten stumps, and sometimes\r\nin the ground. Several other species of ants are very assiduous in their\r\nattendance on the various aphides, _tettigonidæ_, and coccids, but the\r\nabove is the only kind I have noticed that uses such extraordinary means\r\nto secure a monopoly of the much-prized ‘honey-dew.’”\r\n\r\nFor ants that keep and rear Aphides in their nests we need not go\r\nfarther than our own little yellow one—_Lasius flavus_. They guard and\r\nlook after the eggs of their protégés, which form little black shiny\r\nclusters, with the same care that they bestow on their own, and when\r\nthey are hatched set about providing food for the young aphides. This,\r\nit would appear, does not consist of the roots of various plants\r\npenetrating the nest itself, for Sir John Lubbock found that the first\r\nbusiness of the ants, after the young aphides had appeared, was to\r\nconduct or carry them out of the nest, evidently in order that they\r\nshould find their natural food. None being at hand under these\r\nartificial conditions, and the plants required not being known, the poor\r\naphides all died, and this happened again the following year. In the\r\nyear succeeding to this, however, Sir John was more fortunate, and this\r\nis the account he gives of his interesting discovery: “The eggs\r\ncommenced to hatch the first week in March. Near one of my nests of\r\n_Lasius flavus_, in which I had placed some of the eggs in question, was\r\na glass containing living specimens of several species of plants\r\ncommonly found on or around ants’ nests. To this some of the aphides\r\nwere brought by the ants. Shortly afterwards I observed on a plant of\r\ndaisy, in the axils of the leaves, some small aphides very much\r\nresembling those from my nest, though we had not actually traced them\r\ncontinuously. They seemed thriving, and remained stationary on the\r\ndaisy. Moreover, whether they had sprung from the black eggs or not, the\r\nants evidently valued them, for they built up a wall of earth round and\r\nover them. So things remained throughout the summer, but on the 9th of\r\nOctober I found that the aphides had laid some eggs exactly resembling\r\nthose found in the ants’ nests; and on examining daisy-plants from\r\noutside I found on many of them similar aphides and more or less of the\r\nsame eggs.”[49]\r\n\r\nAs the young aphides had been brought by the ants to the daisies, and as\r\nthey had subsequently laid their eggs there, it would certainly seem\r\nthat the ants are accustomed to collect these eggs from without, and\r\nthat the aphides do not lay them in the nest. When they are hatched the\r\nyoung aphides, as we have seen, are taken out to feed and lay, and these\r\nnew eggs laid by them are, in their turn, brought in and tended by the\r\nants. This, as Sir John Lubbock remarks, is a much more remarkable thing\r\nthan if the aphides, living in the nest with the ants, simply laid their\r\neggs there. In that case they would probably hatch out whether they were\r\ntended or not, and it could not be long before the ants would become\r\naware of their value. Here, however, we see this knowledge—how first\r\nobtained we know not—exhibited in a more striking manner, and also a\r\ngreat degree of foresight displayed, since as the eggs, except for\r\naccidents, would hatch where they were, it can only be with the idea of\r\nproviding against these that the ants bring them into their nest. There\r\nthey are safe from many dangers which threaten them above ground, and\r\nare not exposed to the rigours of winter or other climatic vicissitudes.\r\n\r\nWhat are we to say of this act? I think there might be one or two things\r\nto say, but Sir John Lubbock says this: “Our ants may not, perhaps, lay\r\nup food for the winter; but they do more, for they keep, during six\r\nmonths, the eggs which will enable them to procure food during the\r\nfollowing summer—a case of prudence unexampled in the animal\r\nkingdom.”[49] There is a slight national note here which should,\r\nperhaps, make us suspicious. At least, I am always suspicious when a\r\nFrenchman praises anything French, an Englishman anything English—even\r\nants or the climate—a Tierra del Fuegian anything in Tierra del Fuego,\r\nand so on. No doubt if prudence really induces the act, it is very\r\ngreat, but if we could imagine any other cause through which the habit\r\nmight have begun, natural selection would have brought about the rest,\r\nsince those ants which stored aphides’ eggs would have had more aphides,\r\nand consequently more honey-dew to nourish them than those which did\r\nnot. Now the eggs might at first have been eaten, and so carried down,\r\nas provisions, or aphides, brought into the nest, might have laid before\r\nthey got out again. However the act originated, it is probably a\r\nprudential one now, but if the growth of prudence has been aided by that\r\nof an inherited habit, having nothing to do with this, it is not quite\r\nso remarkable. But what, exactly, does “our” in the above passage mean?\r\n_Lasius flavus_ is not confined to England—at least, I suppose not—and\r\nif other countries have a claim on its mental powers, our cue should\r\nrather be to undervalue them—at least, the note of national vanity\r\nshould be held in check by the all as powerful one of national\r\nprejudice.\r\n\r\nBesides these particular aphides, which leave the nest directly after\r\nleaving the egg, there are four or five other species which live in it\r\naltogether, and feed on the roots of various growing plants. Some nests\r\nwhich I had contained a few, but under natural conditions they are to be\r\nfound, I believe, in abundance. Special chambers, it would seem, are\r\ngiven up to them, and in Kirby’s _Marvels of Ant Life_ there is a\r\npicture of such a “subterranean cow-house.” The question arises, where\r\ndo these aphides lay their eggs, and, if in the nest, does not it\r\nlargely discount the intelligence, or prudence, attributed to _Lasius\r\nflavus_ in bringing the other ones into it? In that case, since the eggs\r\nof the various species probably resemble one another, any found outside\r\nwould be brought in by the ants, just as their own larvæ or pupæ would\r\nbe—or anything else which they value—nor need we ascribe greater\r\nforesight to the one act than to the other.\r\n\r\nAnts, however, do more wonderful things in relation to aphides than this\r\nthat Sir John Lubbock has recorded, and if that act is unexampled, as an\r\nexhibition of prudence, elsewhere in the animal kingdom, it is not, I\r\nthink, in this particular branch of it. First it must be remarked that\r\namongst the aphides we have what is called the “alternation of\r\ngenerations,” that is to say a light-loving generation that feeds on the\r\nstems and leaves of upper earth, produces one that loves darkness, whose\r\nfood is only the underground roots of the plants their parents lived on.\r\nThis brood in its turn gives birth to another, which forthwith seeks the\r\nsun, and so the round goes on. There is this difference in the two\r\nbroods, that the light-lovers, nevertheless, seek out darkness when the\r\ntime comes to lay their eggs, whilst the children of darkness lay theirs\r\nin the caves where they have, all their lives, lived. That ants should\r\nbe aware of all this, and habitually adapt their cow-keeping economy to\r\ncircumstances so recondite, seems very extraordinary, but it would\r\ncertainly appear to be the case. Thus when _Lasius fuliginosus_ (another\r\nFranco-Britannico, etc., species) sees _Schizoneura venusta_—its\r\nparticular Aphis—seated on a grass stem, and evidently wishing to lay\r\nher eggs, it knows at once what to do. Soft and large, with voluminous\r\nwings, such an insect is not well fitted for burrowing. She could hardly\r\ndo it, in fact, so the ants, recognising this, begin to do it for her,\r\nand soon drive a tunnel leading down to the roots of the grass, through\r\nwhich they lead her, first, however, having clipped off her wings, which\r\nare now but a useless encumbrance.\r\n\r\nArrived at the terminus, the ants make a proper apartment for their cow\r\nAphis, and here, in the midst of warm sympathisers, and with every\r\ncomfort and luxury about her, she no longer hesitates to lay her eggs.\r\nIn due time they hatch, producing wingless aphides, and from the brood\r\nthus raised the ants obtain their honey. When, however, this crawling\r\ngeneration have in turn produced another winged one, the ants, far from\r\nseeking to detain these in a place where they would only die, again set\r\nto work to make tunnels, through which they conduct them successively to\r\nthe upper air. One tunnel, one would think, would be sufficient for the\r\npurpose; but Lichtenstein, who observed these facts in the south of\r\nFrance,[50] states that each Aphis, as it issues from the egg, has a\r\nseparate one made for it by the ants. Having reached the surface, these\r\ncave-born Ariels spread their wings and fly away. Where they will settle\r\nno ant knows, but to the community that has freed them they are lost,\r\nprobably—they and their eggs—for ever. Do the ants know this? If they\r\ndo, they do not repine at it, for they know also that the perpetuation\r\nof the species, through which alone they can hope for fresh honey, has\r\nbeen provided for. This seems to me altogether to outdo the prudential\r\nfeat of _Lasius flavus_, and since _Lasius fuliginosus_ is distributed\r\nprobably throughout the greater part of Europe, all the nations that do\r\nhonour to that portion of the earth’s surface are at equal liberty to\r\nthink of it with patriotic complacency as “_our_ ant.” For my part, I\r\nwill only say this, that, whether it is or not, I think it deserves to\r\nbe a Japanese ant—or that the Japanese, nowadays, much more deserve to\r\nhave it than we do: that perhaps is the better way of putting it.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 45:\r\n\r\n  Darwin, Origin of Species, pp. 207, 208.\r\n\r\nFootnote 46:\r\n\r\n  “Letter to the Smithsonian Institute,” The American Naturalist,\r\n  September, 1874, p. 565.\r\n\r\nFootnote 47:\r\n\r\n  Belt, The Naturalist in Nicaragua, 1874, p. 226.\r\n\r\nFootnote 48:\r\n\r\n  February, 1898, vol. 14.\r\n\r\nFootnote 49:\r\n\r\n  Lubbock, Ants, Bees, and Wasps, p. 72.\r\n\r\nFootnote 50:\r\n\r\n  Kirby, Text-book of Entomology, p. 113.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\n    Cow caterpillars—The adventures of Theophrastus—Cave-born\r\n      Ariels—Led to the sky—A strange attraction—Ant slaves and\r\n      slave-holders—Slave-making raids—Feeble masters—An ant\r\n      mystery—Effects of slavery—The decadent’s reply.\r\n\r\nAS we have seen, both in this chapter and a former one, aphides are not\r\nthe only insects which yield the ants honey—or something honey-sweet—and\r\nare cherished by them in consequence. There are, for instance, the\r\ncoccidæ, or scale insects, as mentioned by Belt; but whilst some of this\r\nfamily are milked in the same way as the aphides, to which, indeed, they\r\nbear a strong resemblance, others are simply eaten, as though they were\r\nsweets. To them might be said in warning, “Make yourself all honey, and\r\nthe _ants_ will swallow you,” but who can modify the nature of his own\r\njuices? Then there are the ants’-nest beetles, many of which have a\r\nsweet downiness which the ants enjoy licking, and are for this reason\r\ncarried about with them when they move from one place to another. Not\r\nthat they are always carried, for one little beetle, at any rate, whose\r\nname—it must be a diminutive—is _Formicoxenus nitidulus_, is accustomed\r\nto ride on the backs of its protectors, like the little cockroaches\r\ndiscovered by Professor Wheeler.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most interesting parallel to the aphides, as cows, is to\r\nbe found in certain caterpillars, which are as soft and defenceless as\r\nthey are, and represent a class of creatures which ants habitually prey\r\nupon. A certain family of butterflies, however, commonly known as the\r\nBlues, but entitled to the scholarly name of _Lycænidæ_, produce\r\ncaterpillars which bear, upon the twelfth segment of the body, a certain\r\nhoney-holding reservoir which, when full or nearly so, may be made to\r\nyield its contents through the same treatment which is so effectual in\r\nthe case of the aphides. The ants tap or titillate the body of the\r\ncaterpillar, near where the gland is situated, with their antennæ, and\r\nthe caterpillars, charmed with such affability, overflow in return. This\r\ninteresting fact has been observed in various parts of the Old World,\r\nand also in North America; but the most detailed account which we have\r\nof it comes from India. In this case, as in all the others, the\r\ncaterpillar is a quite small one, and feeds on the leaves of a certain\r\ntree, bearing both “an astringent yellow fruit” and the name of\r\n_Zizyphus jujuba_, though, by the way, jujubes are not, as a rule,\r\nastringent. The name of this little caterpillar—it would scorn to be\r\nbehind the tree it feeds on in such a matter—is _Tarucus theophrastus_,\r\nso now we have something to fix it in the memory. The ant that\r\npatronises it is a large black one—_its_ name I cannot give—and here,\r\ntoo, as in the case of the aphidean relations, we have, in the most\r\nnoteworthy of the actions recorded, a very remarkable instance of what\r\nlooks like foresight, and foresight, too, of a very large and general\r\nkind. In the first place, the ants make a nest at the foot of the trees\r\nin which the caterpillars reside, and here, during the period of their\r\ngrowth and nourishment, they avail themselves of their services. But\r\nwhen this period is over, and the caterpillars are about to change into\r\nchrysalids, then a strange scene takes place. All over the tree, ants\r\nare now to be seen running about in a state of the greatest excitement,\r\nand whenever they meet a caterpillar descending, or preparing to\r\ndescend, the trunk, in order to burrow into the earth at its base, and\r\nthere pass its pupal stage of existence, they conduct it down themselves\r\nand relieve it from the labour of digging, just in the same way as our\r\nEnglish ants do with the aphides.\r\n\r\nStill stranger is the scene which reveals itself if the earth at the\r\nbase of the tree be removed, for then it is seen that chrysalids, and\r\ncaterpillars that are about to turn into chrysalids, are clinging all\r\nround the trunk, whilst all amongst them are the ants, helping to place\r\nthis one or that one in position. The band thus formed round the tree\r\nmay be several inches broad, and it is always remarkably even, as though\r\narranged on æsthetic principles. As the light shines in, the ants become\r\nagitated, and seizing hold of their property—for in this light they\r\nconsider the caterpillars—begin to rebury them, so that in time, if the\r\nannoyance continues, they will form a fresh circle of bodies lower down\r\nthe tree. Here, then, is an ants’ nest, described as temporary by Mrs.\r\nWyllie, from whose interesting account[51] the above facts are taken,\r\nfull of butterfly chrysalids, and in about a week it becomes full of\r\nbutterflies themselves, and amidst the rough, black bodies of hosts of\r\nearth-working Calibans, colours born of the rainbow gleam and flash from\r\nthe fairy wings of delicate insect Ariels. Each one of these was helped\r\nfrom its cradle, thus strangely situated, by a little group of these\r\ngnomes, who then assisted it to unfold its wings, and guided its\r\nuncertain steps. Later, when strength has come to it, and something—it\r\nknows not what—like an upward desire, these same gnomes will lead it to\r\nthe portals of their gloomy Hades, where it will spread its wings and\r\nfly to meet the light. In so strange a way, led by such uncouth guides,\r\ndoes Ariel find the sky. Yet, as though the place of their new\r\nbirth—gloomy though it be and opposed to their light-loving natures—had\r\nyet some nameless attraction for them, crowds of these butterflies may\r\nbe seen, for some time after their exodus, hovering over the nest,\r\nbefore they leave it for ever to dwell in the courts of the sun.\r\n\r\nJust as in the case of the aphides released by _Lasius fuliginosus_,\r\nthese ants will never see their butterflies again, nor will they gain\r\nany after advantage that can with certainty be traced to the particular\r\nindividuals thus set free. But they gain in such a manner as, if the\r\nreflection really occurred to them, would make ants not much below men.\r\nThe process of reasoning would be this: “Though we may very likely not\r\nget any caterpillars from the eggs which these butterflies will lay, yet\r\nwe ought not to kill them, because then there would be so many\r\nbutterflies less in the world, to lay eggs, and if we did this every\r\nyear, and other ants too, caterpillars, as well as butterflies, would\r\nbecome scarce, and at last we should not get enough.” For myself I doubt\r\nif ants really do reason like this, but by what steps this habit of\r\nreleasing butterflies so as to ensure the perpetuation of the species\r\nhas come about, I don’t quite see. In the case of the aphides, perhaps\r\nit has been through actual observation of their habits, and here, too,\r\nthis hypothesis may not be excluded, since the butterflies might well be\r\nseen laying their eggs, nor is it unlikely that these are watched, and\r\nthe issuing caterpillars tended from the beginning. For the purposes of\r\nthe ants, indeed, all aphides, and every theophrastus, would be the\r\nsame, and they might very well think that those which they found laying,\r\nor about to lay their eggs, were the very ones previously liberated by\r\nthem from the nest. Thus the difficulty involved in supposing that they\r\nmust reason in a general and not merely in a particular way does not\r\nreally exist.\r\n\r\nSome of these black caterpillar-tending ants of India are not always so\r\nlucky as to secure stock. They may live far from a _jujube_ tree, and so\r\nnever meet the right species; but if ever they do, even though it be in\r\nthe most unexpected manner, they are not taken by surprise,\r\nnotwithstanding that other caterpillars are habitually devoured by them.\r\nMrs. Wyllie proved this by an experiment. “I took Theophrastus,” she\r\ntells us, “from a tree, and introduced him on the pathway of another\r\ncompany of the same species of ant, which lived in our verandah, but\r\nkept no farm, and it was odd to see the ants come tumbling out headlong\r\nto fight the intruder, and the sudden way in which they cooled down on\r\ninvestigation of the foe. None attempted to harm him, and he was\r\npolitely escorted across the boundary, the ants running alongside and\r\nfeeling him all over with their antennæ. This must have been\r\ninstinctive, as they could have had no former knowledge of him as a\r\n‘milk-giver.’” Mrs. Wyllie adds that “the dead chrysalids in an ants’\r\nnest are carefully removed and thrown away outside; the ants also\r\ndistinguish between the dead and the living.”\r\n\r\nAnyone observing or reading about ants might exclaim, on finding that\r\nthey utilised the natural product of other insects and kept them in\r\ncaptivity in order to do so, “Where will this end? May they not, then,\r\nalso keep slaves?” And in very fact, as all the world now knows, we do\r\nfind what is called slavery amongst ants, though to me it hardly seems\r\nthe right word, since there is perfect willingness on the part of the\r\nslave, and no power of punishment lies with the master. There is\r\nequality, moreover, since this is not a matter of the kind of things\r\nwhich one class of a community does and another does not do, but of the\r\nspirit in which each does them. With the ants we have the Japanese\r\nspirit—or rather the Japanese seem getting nearer to the ants—and so\r\nthere is real equality. However, the first act which makes these\r\ncreatures slaves—for I will use terms as I find them—is one of violent\r\nand deadly hostility, and through it they are, of set purpose, taken\r\npossession of and carried off to the nest. At that period, however, they\r\nare yet in the cradle, have yet to be born into their last and most\r\nperfect state of life. From the moment they are so born they grow up as\r\na part, and indeed the most important part, of the body politic, and of\r\nsuch pleasure and consideration as obtains in ant-life they have their\r\nfull share.\r\n\r\nFrom the above it may be gathered that these ant-slaves are ants\r\nthemselves, and this, indeed, is the case. One species of ant raids the\r\nnest of another, overpowers the able-bodied inhabitants, slays or\r\nincapacitates a certain number, and carries away with it to its own nest\r\nas many of the helpless pupæ as it is able to. For a great many\r\nyears—thousands probably—these combats and carrying off of spoil had\r\nbeen observed, but it had always been imagined that the pupæ—or ants’\r\neggs, as they are commonly called—were taken as provisions, merely to be\r\nstored in the nest of the victor, and there eaten at leisure. The\r\ndiscovery of the real truth was an era in the study of ant-history, and\r\nit was made by a Frenchman—Pierre Huber—a man of whom Darwin says that\r\nhe was a “better observer even than his celebrated father,” for Pierre\r\nwas the son of François Huber, the blind man, who yet found out all\r\nabout bees. I hardly see how he can have been _better_ myself; but the\r\nson was not blind, and, of course, eyesight is an advantage in\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nThe particular species of ant concerning which this discovery was made\r\nis _Formica rufescens_, or _Polyergus rufescens_—the reader may take his\r\nchoice—and Darwin, who impresses the facts of ant-slavery upon the mind\r\nbetter than a dozen books specially devoted to ants or insects, says of\r\nit: “This ant is absolutely dependent on its slaves, and without their\r\naid the species would certainly become extinct in a single year. The\r\nmales and fertile females do no work of any kind, and the workers, or\r\nsterile females, though most energetic and courageous in capturing\r\nslaves, do no other work. They are incapable of making their own nests\r\nor of feeding their own larvæ. When the old nest is found inconvenient,\r\nand they have to migrate, it is the slaves which determine the\r\nmigration, and actually carry their masters (one might just as well call\r\n_them their_ slaves) in their jaws. So utterly helpless are the masters,\r\nthat when Huber shut up thirty of them without a slave, but with plenty\r\nof the food which they like best, and with their own larvæ and pupæ to\r\nstimulate them to work, they did nothing; they could not even feed\r\nthemselves, and many perished of hunger. Huber then introduced a single\r\nslave, and she instantly set to work, fed and saved the survivors, made\r\nsome cells, and tended the larvæ, and put all to rights. What can be\r\nmore extraordinary than these well-ascertained facts?”[52] The slave-ant\r\nin this case is _Formica fusca_, and it is also held in bondage by\r\nanother species of slave-maker, viz. _Formica sanguinea_—or the\r\nBlood-red Ant—as was likewise a discovery of Pierre Huber. This last\r\nspecies is found in the south of England, and its slave-making habits\r\nhave been observed by Darwin, who opened fourteen nests and found a few\r\nslaves in all of them. “The slaves,” he tells us, “are black, and not\r\nabove half the size of their red masters, so that the contrast in their\r\nappearance is great.”[52] The black ants were not often seen by Darwin\r\nto leave the nest, and others who have observed their habits in England\r\nhave considered them as “strictly household slaves.”[52] Huber, however,\r\nwhose observations were carried on in Switzerland, says that “their\r\nchief office is to search for aphides,”[52] and this would take them far\r\nafield. In Switzerland, however, slaves seem to be more numerous in the\r\nnests of the Blood-red Ant, and Darwin attributes the difference in\r\ntheir habits to this account. Huber also tells us that the Swiss slaves\r\n“habitually work with their masters in making the nest, and they alone\r\nopen and close the doors in the morning and evening.”[52] This is done,\r\nI suppose, by placing pellets of earth in the mouth of the\r\nentrance-tunnel and removing them again; but there is one species of ant\r\nwhich would have only to place or remove itself, for this purpose, since\r\nits large head, by being wedged into the passage, stops it up, and thus\r\nfulfils the office of a front door. The ant that does this must be one\r\nbelonging to a certain caste of workers having very large heads, for the\r\nheads of the other ones would not be large enough. The nest of this\r\nspecies is made in decaying wood, and there is always some worker who\r\nthus uses his large head as a stopper, removing it when a\r\nfellow-townsman wishes to enter the nest, but presenting its smooth,\r\nimpenetrable surface, guarded with jaws, to all unauthorised intruders.\r\nIt is Forel, one of the best ant-observers of to-day, who tells us this,\r\nand the ant apparently is _Lasius fuliginosus_, which is a British\r\nspecies, and, according to an account which I have already referred to,\r\ndoes not seem to be always a wood-borer. _Formica sanguinea_, however,\r\ndoes things—or has things done for it—after a more ordinary fashion.\r\n\r\nDarwin was the witness of a slave-raid on the part of _F. sanguinea_\r\nwhich was not, in this instance, very successful. He says: “They\r\napproached, and were vigorously repulsed by an independent community of\r\nthe slave-species (_F. fusca_), sometimes as many as three of these ants\r\nclinging to the legs of the slave-making _sanguinea_. The latter\r\nruthlessly killed their small opponents, and carried their dead bodies\r\nas food to their nest, twenty-nine yards distant; but they were\r\nprevented from getting any pupæ to rear as slaves. I then dug up a small\r\nparcel of the pupæ of _Formica fusca_ from another nest, and put them\r\ndown on a bare spot near the place of combat; they were eagerly seized\r\nand carried off by the tyrants, who perhaps fancied that, after all,\r\nthey had been victorious in their late combat.”[52] In his work, _Ants\r\nand their Ways_,[53] the Rev. Farren White describes a similar raid\r\nwhich was—or rather which had been, for it was nearly over when he\r\narrived on the scene—wholly successful. Here, however, the oppressed\r\nspecies seems to have made a very poor resistance, though very likely it\r\nhad been more vigorous in the earlier stages of the raid. “I watched a\r\n_fusca_,” says Mr. White, “carrying off a pupa from behind the entrance\r\nwhence the _sanguineæ_ were issuing forth. Immediately it saw one of the\r\nenemy approaching, it dropped its charge and left it to its fate. The\r\n_sanguinea_ then gave it a push, and drove it off in double-quick time”;\r\nand, again, “I noticed a _sanguinea_ coming up out of the nest with a\r\npupa, and a _fusca_, observing it, went up a fern-frond with the utmost\r\nexpedition.”[53] Other observations of a similar nature were made, and\r\nthe conclusion arrived at by Mr. White is “that between the _fuscæ_ and\r\nthe _sanguineæ_ there is a well-defined and clearly pronounced\r\nantagonism. In presence of the _sanguineæ_ the _fuscæ_ were\r\nterror-stricken. In fact the depredators had it all their own way, and\r\nwere able in this instance, at least, to carry out their marvellous\r\ninstincts without destroying a single life.”[53] It will be seen how ill\r\nthis accords with the account given by Darwin. My own way of accounting\r\nfor the discrepancy is that, in the first instance, the little _fuscæ_\r\nwere flushed with success, and, in the second, demoralised through\r\ndefeat. The same effects would follow the same causes in all but the\r\nmost splendid human armies.\r\n\r\nThe raids made by the first-mentioned species, _Polyergus rufescens_,\r\nor, as Huber calls them, the Amazon ants, are of an even more determined\r\ndescription, for none are braver, or perhaps so brave. If one of these\r\nshould find herself alone and in the midst of enemies, she makes no\r\neffort to escape, as many, though not all, other species would, but\r\nfights on to the end, making constant agile leaps to this side or that,\r\nat every one of which she transfixes an enemy, and dies at last biting\r\nhard. To fight, indeed, is the whole end, aim, and business of life for\r\nan Amazon, and we have already seen how they do no work, and are washed,\r\nfed, and carried by their servants. It is not quite true, however, that\r\nthey cannot feed themselves, as Pierre Huber thought, and had good\r\nreason to think, for a well-known living observer—Herr Wasmann—has\r\ndiscovered that their mandibles are so constructed as to enable them “to\r\nabsorb nourishment from eggs or pupæ.” Possibly the mandibles are\r\nhollow, and communicate thus with the mouth, as is the case with some\r\nother insects, but I have not Wasmann’s account at hand, and his\r\nexponent says only this. Wasmann tells us also that these Amazons will\r\n“absorb nourishment,” however they do it, even from the eggs of their\r\nown species. They cannot, however, feed on liquid food, and as they had\r\nno other when shut up without servants, that is why they died, or would\r\nhave died, had these not been brought them in time. So too, though their\r\nslaves wash and brush them, yet they are always brushing themselves and\r\nattending generally to their own toilette, and this they do even amidst\r\n\r\n                    “All the currents of a heady fight,”\r\n\r\nso that Wasmann has compared them to the Spartans combing their long\r\nhair before the battle of Thermopylæ, though we are not told that they\r\ncombed it after the fight had begun.\r\n\r\nStill, it seems plain that the habit of keeping slaves has exercised a\r\ndegrading influence on these ants, and this tendency is much more\r\nmarkedly apparent in several other species. One of these with a really\r\ndreadful name, _Strongylognathus_—we might call them Strong Ants, but\r\nthey seem to be weak ones—is described by Forel as “_une triste\r\ncaricature_” of the Amazons, and the extraordinary thing is that,\r\nthough themselves feeble and enervated, they manage to make, or by\r\nsome means obtain as slaves, the workers of a much more robust\r\nspecies—_Tetramorium_, to wit; workers, by the way, are the only class\r\nof ants ever enslaved. These weak ants fight in the same way as the\r\nAmazons themselves; but, though spirited enough, they are so much\r\ninferior in bodily vigour to the _Tetramoriums_, “a courageous species\r\nliving in large communities, that in a battle between the two,\r\nartificially instigated by Forel, almost all the slave-holders were\r\nkilled, without being able to avenge their deaths even on a single one\r\nof those whom they aspired to rule.” Yet they won the day, or rather\r\nthe already enslaved _Tetramoriums_, who marched to do battle for\r\nthem, won it for the few survivors in their ranks. From this we can\r\nsee how, when these decadents once have slaves, they may get more. The\r\ndifficulty is how they are obtained in the first instance—when a nest\r\nis first founded by a queen of the slave-making species, for example.\r\nIt might be supposed, finding two kinds of ants living together, one\r\nweaker and much more helpless than the other, that the former lived a\r\nparasitic existence in the nest of the latter, and was not a\r\nslave-owner at all; but this theory is disproved by the fact that no\r\nmales or females of the _Tetramoriums_ are ever to be found, showing\r\nthat it is not they but the others who are the true founders of the\r\nnest.\r\n\r\nA still more extraordinary instance of a slave-holding species of ant\r\nthan the one just mentioned is _Anergates atratulus_, for in this there\r\nare no workers at all, only kings and queens, who are waited on, and\r\ntheir eggs and larvæ fed and tended, by the slave species—_Tetramorium_,\r\nin this case also—just as though these latter were their true-born\r\nsubjects. Here too the slave species is only represented by workers.\r\nThese male and female _Anergates_—a worker of the species has never been\r\nknown—are both few in number and weak in themselves. When a pair of them\r\n(or a fertilised queen) go off to found a new colony, how do they, or\r\nhow do their few weak descendants, impress a strong fierce species into\r\ntheir service, by whom the nest is built, and every other service\r\nperformed? The question remains unanswered. Nobody knows. Several\r\ntheories have been advanced, one by Sir John Lubbock, who supposes that\r\nthe king and queen of _Anergates_ assassinate the queen of _Tetramorium_\r\nand reign in her stead,[54] and another, more recently, by Wasmann,\r\nwhose idea is that fertile queens of _Anergates_ are sometimes adopted\r\nby a colony of _Tetramoriums_ who have lost their own queen. This last\r\nis the newest suggestion, and is considered just at present, perhaps for\r\nthat reason, the most probable. To me Sir John Lubbock’s view seems\r\nlikelier to be correct, since it is more usual in nature for the weak to\r\nprey, as parasites, upon the strong, than for the strong to seek\r\nassistance of the weak. True, I can form no idea as to how the\r\nassassination of the rightful queen takes place, but Nature is full of\r\nresources, and will do much to promote a really worthy end.\r\n\r\nI will conclude this chapter by quoting some remarks of Sir John Lubbock\r\nas to the ill effects which the institution of slavery exercises, with\r\nants as with men, upon the character of the slave-holder. “These four\r\ngenera,” he says, “offer us every gradation from lawless violence to\r\ncontemptible parasitism. _Formica sanguinea_, which may be assumed to\r\nhave comparatively recently taken to slave-making, has not, as yet, been\r\nmaterially affected. _Polyergus_, on the contrary, already illustrates\r\nthe lowering tendency of slavery. They have lost their knowledge of art\r\nand their natural affection for their young! They are, however, bold and\r\npowerful marauders. In _Strongylognathus_ the enervating influence of\r\nslavery has gone further, and told even on the bodily strength. They are\r\nno longer able to capture their slaves in fair and open warfare. Still,\r\nthey retain a semblance of authority, and, when roused, will fight\r\nbravely, though in vain. In _Anergates_, finally, we come to the last\r\nscene of this sad history. We may safely conclude that in distant times\r\ntheir ancestors lived, as so many ants do now, partly by hunting, partly\r\non honey; that by degrees they became bold marauders, and gradually took\r\nto keeping slaves; that for a time they maintained their strength and\r\nagility, though losing, by degrees, their real independence, their arts,\r\nand even many of their instincts; that gradually even their bodily force\r\ndwindled away under the enervating influence to which they had subjected\r\nthemselves, until they sank to their present degraded condition—weak in\r\nbody and mind, few in numbers, and, apparently, nearly extinct, the\r\nmiserable representatives of far superior ancestors, maintaining a\r\nprecarious existence as contemptible parasites of their former\r\nslaves.”[55]\r\n\r\nSince, however, in all these cases the masters are still truly served by\r\ntheir slaves, who make them comfortable, and have no more sense of their\r\ndegradation than they themselves have, an answer might be made to these\r\nmoralisings. However various the masks behind which true motives lie\r\nhid, happiness, diversely conceived of, is the one end and aim of all.\r\nDoes it, then, really much matter by what means it is attained? Till we\r\ncan show that these slave-holding ants have become less and less happy,\r\nwe are only tilting at shadows, and an _Anergates_ might very well say,\r\nin regard to the above view, “Tut, prut, drop your heroics. I am very\r\ncomfortable; these strong fellows work for me. I like not working, and\r\nwhat I am I wish to be.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 51:\r\n\r\n  It appeared, I think, originally in the _Bombay Journal_ and is\r\n  reproduced in one of the leading entomological magazines.\r\n\r\nFootnote 52:\r\n\r\n  Darwin, Origin of Species, pp. 216, 217, 218.\r\n\r\nFootnote 53:\r\n\r\n  Rev.

Some species of ants,\r\nhowever, inhabit the nests of other species, or build their own amidst\r\ntheirs in such a way as almost to make them one, and thus they live as\r\nperpetual guests, not only without paying for such accommodation by\r\nrendering their hosts any services, but often forcing these latter to\r\nbe of service to them in other ways also. Thus, a small species of\r\nTexan ant whose first or Christian name is _Leptothorax_, but whose\r\nsurname has not yet been fixed upon, lives on these terms in the nests\r\nof a larger one, the celebrated _Myrmica brevinodis_. Whether\r\nProfessor Wheeler was the discoverer of the little ant I am not quite\r\nsure, but he was the first, I think, to observe its relations with the\r\nbig one and those of the big one with it, and his account of them is\r\nexcessively interesting. “A small dish,” he says, “containing a syrup\r\nof sugar and water was placed near the nest (an artificial one under\r\nclose observation). This was soon found by two of the _Myrmica_\r\nworkers, which at once gorged themselves with the liquid and returned\r\ninto the nest.”[56] Soon afterwards a _Leptothorax_ worker entered it\r\nalso, and having run or tracked down one of the two honey-gorged\r\ncreatures, forthwith got up on to its back, and, seated there, began\r\nto lick its head, an attention which it supplemented with a soft,\r\npersuasive titillation with its antennæ, whilst at the same time\r\ncommunicating a motion to its abdomen, which Professor Wheeler is so\r\nconvinced must have been accompanied with certain sounds—known to the\r\nlearned as stridulations—that he does not hesitate to affirm that it\r\nwas thrown “into stridulatory oscillation.” Nor was the _Myrmica_ deaf\r\nto such an appeal. It slackened its pace, hesitated, then paused, and\r\nas though unable longer to resist the influence, folded its antennæ\r\nand appeared to give itself up to the full pleasure of the thing. The\r\ntempter, now, still making soft play with the antennæ, lowered its own\r\nhead, and began to lick the _Myrmica_ first on one cheek and then the\r\nother, including also the mandibles and parts adjoining. Thus\r\nfostered, a dewy moisture, drawn evidently from the reservoir of\r\nlately swallowed nectar, began to glisten on the lips of the large\r\nant, and, increasing rapidly to a droplet, was re-imbibed by the\r\nexpectant little one. “The latter,” says Professor Wheeler, “then\r\ndismounted, ran to another _Myrmica_, climbed on its back, and\r\nrepeated the very same performance. Again it took toll, and passed on\r\nto still another _Myrmica_.”[56] Up to the present the attention of\r\nProfessor Wheeler had been concentrated on the doings of this one\r\nindividual, but now, turning his attention to other parts of the nest,\r\nhe “observed that nearly all the _Leptothorax_ workers were similarly\r\nemployed. In one corner a number of _Myrmica_ workers had formed a\r\ncircle about a few of their small larvæ, which they were cleansing and\r\nfeeding. A _Leptothorax_ soon found its way to this cluster, and\r\nstepped from the back of one ant to that of another, lavishing a\r\nshampoo on each in turn, and apparently filling its crop with the\r\nliquid contributions thus solicited.”\r\n\r\nThe above method of obtaining food appears to be peculiar to these ant\r\nparasites. Beetles, for example, solicit it either by taps or touches\r\nwith the antennæ—which is a similar one indeed, but does not go so far\r\nnor involve a ride—or else by stroking the face of their host with their\r\nfore-feet. Other species of ants, when soliciting food from one another\r\nor demanding it from their slaves, employ a more or less similar method,\r\nwhilst the _Lepismid_ that we have before spoken of is a thief pure and\r\nsimple. Licking seems to be the personal discovery of _Leptothorax_, and\r\nbeing licked the peculiar privilege of _Myrmica brevinodis_. That it is\r\na valued one is clear, but the price asked for it is not always\r\nforthcoming, possibly because there is not always anything to forthcome.\r\nOn such barren occasions _Leptothorax_ makes the best of a bad job, and\r\ndismounting from its first love, runs about looking for another.\r\n\r\nSometimes, after having licked the head and face of its patron, the poor\r\npetitioner turns round and proceeds to do the same by its abdomen. This,\r\nperhaps, is a last effort of persuasion, but Professor Wheeler rather\r\nsupposes the surface of _Myrmica’s_ body to be “covered with some\r\nagreeable secretion.” Queen _Myrmicas_, however, seem to be very rarely\r\ntreated to any sort of licking, and males apparently never. The reason\r\nof this, probably, is that both queens and males are themselves\r\naccustomed to receive their food from the workers by a similar process\r\nof regurgitation, and are probably therefore not in the habit of\r\nregurgitating it. They are therefore neglected by the little parasites,\r\nwho console themselves by being all the more insistent with those who\r\nhave something to give. These—that is to say, the workers—are waylaid\r\nwhenever they enter the nest, as having presumably found something to\r\neat outside it, and, in order to be on the spot, at once their\r\nimportunate lickers, who seem to live in a perpetual state of crying,\r\n“Give! give!” keep in the more or less immediate proximity of the\r\nentrance, or entrances, should there be more than one. Professor\r\nWheeler, indeed, doubts if the _Leptos_ ever feed themselves in the\r\nordinary way, but inasmuch as they were on one occasion seen by him to\r\ndo so, such doubt appears to me to be uncalled for.\r\n\r\nThese little ants make, in regard to the big ones within whose nest they\r\nlive, a sort of _imperium in imperio_. In a small chamber surrounded by\r\nthe large galleries of the _Myrmicas_, and communicating with these by a\r\npassage too narrow for the latter to pass through, lives the queen with\r\na small number of workers; eight of them in the nest observed by\r\nProfessor Wheeler, together with a few larvæ, almost filling the cavity.\r\nThey appear to be on affectionate terms with one another, the workers\r\nfeeding their queen in the most assiduous manner, and she often playing\r\nwith them like a cat with her kittens, throwing them on to their backs,\r\nand then “hugging and kissing them” (as Professor Wheeler describes it)\r\n_con amore_. Not that the Professor himself takes this view of it, for\r\nafter hesitating whether to ascribe such behaviour to maternal\r\naffection, “the play instinct,” or hunger, he decides for the latter—on\r\nwhat grounds, since there was a continual passage of viands from one ant\r\nto another, the queen especially being “assiduously fed,” I am unable to\r\nsee. What, too, is “the play instinct,” except a mere term made use of\r\nin order to suggest the idea of automatism in regard to an act which\r\nhardly seems to admit of such an interpretation? Instincts represent\r\nimperious necessities which, if not attended to, the species must fail\r\nor perish. Such, at any rate, are the grounds on which they must be\r\nsupposed to have been originally built up. But what creature has had to\r\nplay in order to survive? Not ants, surely, who work so hard that they\r\ncannot stand in need of more exercise than their daily life affords\r\nthem. Nor, it would seem, is such an instinct developed amongst other\r\ninsects, which again seems to show that it cannot be of any great\r\nimportance. When, therefore, we find that ants, the most wonderful of\r\nall insects, do play, this strongly suggests their possession of an\r\nintelligence analogous to that of the higher animals. Instinct, however,\r\nis largely independent of intelligence, such as we understand it, and\r\ntherefore, to allude to “the play instinct” in ants before the\r\ninstinctive character of the act has been made out, is to prejudge the\r\nquestion whether ants are automatic or reasoning beings.\r\n\r\nThe smallness of the passages leading from the interior chamber of\r\n_Leptothorax_ to the broad galleries of the _Myrmicas_ suggests that the\r\nlatter were not intended to pass through them; but we cannot really draw\r\nthis inference, since an ant in tunnelling would allow for the size of\r\nits own body, but not for that of another species. Certain it is that\r\nthe big ants constantly force their way through the narrow passages,\r\nthus partly breaking down the wall, and that they are then received by\r\nthe little ones in a quite friendly manner, and persuaded to part with\r\nsome of their interior stores. Still, when this has been effected, their\r\nfriends seem mildly desirous that they should go, and, as soon as they\r\nhave gone, set to work to repair the breaches made by their entrance. No\r\nsooner has this been done, however, than they are broken down again, and\r\nso it may continue, apparently, for an indefinite period, at any rate in\r\nnests constructed for observational purposes, and where the conditions\r\nare, therefore, more or less artificial. Whether it is so to anything\r\nlike the same extent under nature may well be doubted, for that any\r\ncreature should live in a state of never-ending useless labour does not\r\nseem likely; and, moreover, unless the one ant could have made itself\r\ncomfortable within the nest of the other, why should it have become\r\nestablished there at all? But whatever it may be outside the study, this\r\nis Professor Wheeler’s account of what fell under his observation: “At\r\none p.m.,” he tells us, “the _Myrmica_ workers discovered the\r\nhiding-place of their little companions, and two of them, in single\r\nfile, shouldered their way through the narrow passage, enlarging it as\r\nthey proceeded. As soon as the head of the first _Myrmica_ appeared in\r\nthe chamber, the _Leptothoraxes_ which had been attending to their\r\nmorning toilet and that of their larvæ, and to the careful arrangement\r\nof their eggs, turned to meet the intruders.”\r\n\r\n                              “Now dreadful deeds\r\n                          Might have ensued,”\r\n\r\nand for such an upshot, indeed, upon the first occasion, Professor\r\nWheeler was prepared. “For an instant,” he says, “I fully expected to\r\nsee a fierce battle, but I had misjudged the _Leptothorax_ character. To\r\nmy surprise the _Myrmicas_ on entering were received with a profusion of\r\nshampooing, and, though sadly crowding the occupants of the little\r\nchamber, they let themselves down comfortably, and appeared to\r\nexperience all the sensuous satisfaction of a couple of _roués_ who have\r\ndropped into a Turkish bath for the night. Yet the little _Leptos_,\r\nthough behaving in this friendly manner” (their conduct indeed was not\r\nmore disinterested than upon other occasions), “seemed to have some dim\r\ndesire to remove the _Myrmicas_ from their nest, for from time to time\r\none was seen to pull with her mandibles at the fore leg or antenna of\r\none of the intruders, as if to remind her that there are limits to\r\npolite hospitality.” Professor Wheeler adds that “this was the only act\r\neven approaching hostility witnessed between the two species. The\r\n_Myrmicas_ never showed the slightest irritation towards the _Leptos_,\r\nnever seized them in their mandibles or even menaced them. They seemed\r\nrather to look upon the little creatures with gentle benevolence, much\r\nas human adults regard little children. They never passed their little\r\nguests without the antennal greeting, and the _Leptos_ shampooed their\r\nhosts with comical zeal.”[56] The continued breaking down and repair of\r\nthe dividing wall is then described, with the conclusion that “in their\r\nnatural environment the _Leptothoraxes_ would not be cramped for space,\r\nand would probably dig their cell where they would not so frequently be\r\ndisturbed by their inquisitive hosts.”\r\n\r\nAs regards the possible effects upon the _Myrmicas_ of having thus\r\nfrequently to render up food swallowed for their own nourishment, it\r\nmust be remembered that amongst most ants this is a thing of custom;\r\nand, again, it seems probable that there would be an internal sense on\r\nthe part of the regurgitating individual as to concessions of this\r\nnature having gone as far as it was healthy that they should go. As we\r\nhave seen, they are not infrequently refused. Professor Wheeler,\r\nhowever, came to the conclusion that _Myrmica_ colonies suffer very\r\nconsiderably from this cause, and on this he makes the following\r\ncomment: “If I have correctly estimated the influences which may tend to\r\ndiminish the fecundity and prosperity of the _Myrmicas_, we have in this\r\ndouble nest another striking demonstration of the complete absence in\r\nants of any faculty of reason. For if the _Myrmicas_ possessed a glimmer\r\nof this faculty they could easily annihilate the gluttonous little\r\nnest-mates that are for ever roaming about their galleries like so many\r\nanimated stomach-pumps.”[56] Yes, truly a _most_ “striking\r\ndemonstration,” seeing that we human ants can annihilate, all in a\r\nmoment, any evil that has insensibly gained a footing amongst us, and\r\nwith which we have been familiarised from birth. Custom, growing\r\ngradually from unnoticed beginnings, plays no part at all amongst\r\nus—never affects our views in the very slightest degree. In Europe we\r\nhang up all the brewers and distillers; whilst mobs of infuriated\r\nChinamen rend in pieces the vendors of opium and crushers of their\r\nwomen’s feet. There is no such thing in _human_ nature as tolerating an\r\nevil for the pleasure that lives in it; no _man_ ruins his health, and\r\nsinks into an early grave, through being a slave to sensual pleasures.\r\nNor can what is manifestly wrong seem right to _us_; there is no\r\npernicious, obstinate, wilful shutting of _our_ eyes. What a contrast\r\ndoes all this present with such a state of affairs as we are here\r\nconsidering! And how plain it is that there can be no reasoning power in\r\nthe ant, since reason and right conduct are synonymous with man!\r\n\r\nWhat is the origin of these strange co-partnerships—for there are\r\nothers—which we find existing between ants of two different species\r\nliving in the same or in one double nest? As we know, the different\r\nspecies of ants are commonly very hostile to one another; and for any to\r\nenter the nest of some other one is to court destruction, if they be not\r\nthe stronger party. Nay, they dare not even enter a strange nest of\r\ntheir own species. It seems probable, therefore—this, at least, is my\r\nown view of it—that such friendly cohabitation has come about through\r\nthe channel, not of peace, but of war—through successful encroachments\r\nwhich, from being unavoidable, have come gradually to be less and less\r\nresented, till the two parties, mingling freely, have learnt to live on\r\nother terms. Now there are ants which live, like ogres, in the nests of\r\nother species, preying upon their eggs and young. Such a one is\r\n_Solenopsis fugax_—to whom we will come presently—but it is perhaps even\r\nmore interesting to find in species between whom relations of a similar\r\nnature to those which we have been considering exist, occasional slight\r\ntraces of a mutual hostility. As between the _Leptos_ and _Myrmicas_\r\nindeed this has only as yet been noticed, very faintly, on the part of\r\nthe former; but in regard to another pair who live together—our great\r\nwood-ant, namely, _Formica rufa_ and tiny little _Formicoxenus\r\nnitidulus_—Professor Wheeler remarks: “On one occasion in one of my\r\nartificial nests, in which the ants had previously lived on good terms\r\nwith one another, I saw a _Formica_ touching a _Formicoxenus_ with her\r\nantennæ and menacing her with her mandibles, but she departed without\r\neven attempting to seize her. In the same nest I found a _Formicoxenus_\r\nwhich had seized the leg of a _Formica_ in its mandibles and had died in\r\nthis position.”[57] Other observers, too, have from time to time—but\r\nonly very occasionally—noticed facts of the same sort. Through such\r\nexceptional slight indications we may perhaps see, “as in a glass\r\ndarkly,” what things were at the beginning.\r\n\r\nLet us now look at the beginning. _Solenopsis fugax_, Sir John Lubbock\r\ntells us, “makes its chambers and galleries in the walls of the nests of\r\nlarger species, and is the bitter enemy of its hosts. The latter cannot\r\nget at them because they are too large to enter the galleries. The\r\nlittle _Solenopses_, therefore, are quite safe, and, as it appears, make\r\nincursions into the nurseries of the larger ant and carry off the larvæ\r\nas food. It is as if we had small dwarfs about eighteen inches to two\r\nfeet long harbouring in the walls of our houses and every now and then\r\ncarrying off some of our children into their horrid dens.”[58] This is\r\nthe general proposition. Monsieur Janet can add a few particulars. “The\r\n_Solenopsis_,” he says, “may establish itself near almost any other ants\r\nof our country, and is found especially with....” Here follows a list\r\nall in Latin, but our common Wood-ant—the large one that makes those\r\ngreat heaps of pine-needles—and the Amazon, or slave-making ant, are\r\ncontained in it.[59] “The _Solenopsis_ nest,” continues M. Janet, “may\r\npartially surround that of its neighbour’s, or it may even be partly\r\nexcavated in the masses of earth which separate the galleries of the\r\nlatter. In each case—and probably, too, when, as is frequent, there is\r\nnot such close contiguity—fine connecting galleries enable the\r\n_Solenopsis_ to make incursions into the nests of their neighbours,\r\nwhere, as we shall see, they find an abundance of food. The actual nest\r\nconsists of a number of small circular chambers about 8-20 mm. in\r\ndiameter and only 6-8 mm. in height. Most of these chambers are\r\nseparated from one another by several centimetres, and are connected by\r\nslender galleries, often less than two millimetres in diameter, entering\r\nthe chambers at their walls, ceilings, or floors, which latter are\r\nremarkably clean, smooth, and hard.”[59]\r\n\r\nThe food of which these horrid little ants find such an abundance is, of\r\ncourse, the cocoons and larvæ of their unfortunate neighbours, and M.\r\nJanet gives the following account of the way in which they dispose of\r\nthem: “From ten to thirty of them,” he says, “climb up on to a cocoon\r\nand cover it with little perforations which, finally, becoming\r\nconfluent, enable them to reach its contents. If it contains a pupa, the\r\nlegs and antennæ fall an easy prey to the mandibles of the _Solenopses_.\r\nIn this case the victim is cut into, sucked, and torn into very small\r\npieces, which the ants hasten to carry away into the interior of the\r\nnest. The operation is much more difficult in the case of a larva which\r\nhas just spun its cocoon. Such a one I have seen the _Solenopses_ drag\r\ninto the interior of the nest and keep working at for twenty-four hours.\r\nAt the expiration of this period the larva began to look flaccid (as may\r\nbe believed), and was covered with little black dots which were,\r\nsometimes, double, corresponding with the little wounds made by the\r\nmandibles of its assassins. Numbers of the latter were busy lapping up\r\nthe liquid which exuded from the wounds, but it was not until thirty-six\r\nhours had elapsed that the larva was entirely devoured.”[59] This is\r\ncertainly not a pleasant picture, yet, if our surmise is correct, the\r\nremote descendants of these murderous _Solenopses_ may become as\r\nharmless and as pretty in their ways as the little _Leptos_, a\r\nreflection which goes far to discount any uncomfortable feelings we\r\nmight otherwise have been inclined to have in regard to the general plan\r\nor scheme of things. Thus, in nature, though occasionally a slight\r\nshadow may seem to rest upon the landscape, the next moment the very\r\nmemory of it is lost in a blaze of sunlight glory.\r\n\r\nForel believes that when a _Solenopsis_, and one of the larger species\r\nof ants that it plagues, meet, the latter are unable to see it on\r\naccount of its small size, so that, practically, it is invisible. This\r\nseems a strange doctrine, since the same ants can see smaller things;\r\nand yet, from their behaviour under such circumstances, M. Janet is\r\ninclined to think so too. It can hardly be that they shun combat, though\r\nthe _Solenopses_, in spite of their small size, are able, even here, by\r\nvirtue of their numbers, and being armed with stings, to meet their\r\nvictims, as one may almost call them, upon equal terms. M. Janet,\r\nindeed, once saw so strong and warlike a species as the slave-making\r\n_Formica sanguinea_ killed by some half-dozen _Solenopses_, but he adds\r\nthat on such occasions a considerable number of the latter were,\r\ngenerally, killed also. This, however, is not sufficient to abate the\r\nevil, so perhaps the molested species, finding that fighting is of no\r\nuse, accustomed to see _Solenopses_ from their birth, recognising, too,\r\nas a part of their own atmosphere, the distinctive smell which they, no\r\ndoubt, possess, accept them like some disagreeable part of their lives,\r\nand try to make the best of it.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 56:\r\n\r\n  The American Naturalist, vol. 35, No. 419.\r\n\r\nFootnote 57:\r\n\r\n  The American Naturalist, July, 1901.\r\n\r\nFootnote 58:\r\n\r\n  Lubbock, Ants, Bees, and Wasps, pp. 78, 79.\r\n\r\nFootnote 59:\r\n\r\n  Janet, Etudes sur les Fourmis.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ant wonders—Leaves cut for mushroom-growing—How ants plant\r\n      mushrooms—A nest in a mushroom-bed—“Psychic plasticity”—Two\r\n      opinions—Ant stupidity—Unfair comparisons—The ant and\r\n      the servant-maid—Mushroom-growing beetles—Choked by\r\n      ambrosia—Intelligent uselessness—Automatic phraseology—A\r\n      curious insect.\r\n\r\nANTS, as everybody knows, have a special faculty for doing extraordinary\r\nthings. Only a few of these have been mentioned in the last and\r\npreceding chapters, and only a few more can be touched upon in this. To\r\ndo the subject anything like justice, a whole large book would be\r\nrequired, not a few chapters merely of a quite small one. What ants do,\r\nindeed, reminds me of the refrain, constantly repeated, of a certain old\r\nballad lately brought to my notice, viz.—\r\n\r\n           “Wonders, notable wonders! never the like was heard.”\r\n\r\nFor instance, they grow mushrooms (rice, or some cereals, they used to\r\ngrow and reap, but lately they have not been allowed to); they use their\r\nown larvæ as an implement to sew or stick things together with, thus\r\nmaking little shuttles of them; they make bridges of their own bodies,\r\nby which they pass over rivers—even wide ones, it would seem, at least\r\nfor them—which otherwise would be impassable; they allow themselves to\r\nbe made into honey-pots and kept full for the good of the general\r\ncommunity, who take a little of them when they want it; they have\r\ncemeteries, and would appear even to feel something like awe or respect\r\nin the presence of their own dead; they cause certain plants to grow and\r\ncome to maturity, which would otherwise die, in order to make a house in\r\nthem, and so on and so on, many other wonders equally notable, to say\r\nnothing of those which have already been recounted.\r\n\r\nTo take the first on the list—I hardly believe in a classification of\r\nwonders—Belt, who was an engineer, but ought to have given up his whole\r\nlife to observations of this sort, was the first, I believe, to find out\r\nthat ants were mushroom-growers. Like others, when he came to Nicaragua\r\nhe saw the leaf-cutting ants passing in long, double columns backwards\r\nand forwards between their nests and the trees, the homeward-bound\r\ncolumn laden with their little crescent-shaped bits of green leaf, the\r\noutgoing one empty-handed. “The first acquaintance a stranger generally\r\nmakes with them,” says Belt, “is on encountering their paths on the\r\noutskirts of the forest crowded with the ants; one lot carrying off the\r\npieces of leaves, each piece about the size of a sixpence, and held up\r\nvertically between the jaws of the ant; another lot hurrying along in an\r\nopposite direction empty-handed, but eager to get loaded with their\r\nleafy burdens. If he follows this last division, it will lead him to\r\nsome young trees or shrubs, up which the ants mount; and where each one,\r\nstationing itself on the edge of a leaf, commences to make a circular\r\ncut, with its scissor-like jaws, from the edge, its hinder feet being\r\nthe centre on which it turns. When the piece is nearly cut off it is\r\nstill stationed upon it, and it looks as though it would fall to the\r\nground with it, but on being finally detached the ant is generally found\r\nto have hold of the leaf with one foot, and soon righting itself, and\r\narranging its burden to its satisfaction, it sets off at once on its\r\nreturn. Following it again, it is seen to join a throng of others, each\r\nladen like itself, and, without a moment’s delay, it hurries along the\r\nwell-worn path. As it proceeds, other paths, each thronged with busy\r\nworkers, come in from the sides, until the main road often gets to be\r\nseven or eight inches broad, and more thronged than the streets of the\r\ncity of London. Standing near the mounds, one sees from every point of\r\nthe compass ant-paths leading to them, all thronged with the busy\r\nworkers carrying their leafy burdens. As far as the eye can distinguish\r\ntheir tiny forms, troops upon troops of leaves are moving up towards the\r\ncentral point and disappearing down the numerous tunnelled passages. The\r\noutgoing empty-handed hosts are partly concealed amongst the bulky\r\nburdens of the incomers, and can only be distinguished by looking\r\nclosely amongst them.”[60]\r\n\r\nIt used to be supposed that these leaves themselves, in a decaying\r\nstate, were the food of the ants, whilst another theory was that they\r\nwere used to make a sort of underground roof to the nest with. Belt’s\r\ndiscovery took everybody—including himself—completely by surprise. “I\r\nbelieve,” he says, “the real use they make of them is as a manure, on\r\nwhich grows a minute species of fungus, on which they feed: that they\r\nare in reality mushroom growers and eaters”;[60] and he thus narrates\r\nthe circumstances which led him to this conclusion:—\r\n\r\n“When I first began my warfare against the ants that attacked my garden,\r\nI dug down deeply into some of their nests. In our mining operations we\r\nalso, on two occasions, carried our excavations from below up through\r\nvery large formicariums, so that all their underground workings were\r\nexposed to observation. I found their nests below to consist of numerous\r\nrounded chambers, about as large as a man’s head, connected together by\r\ntunnelled passages leading from one chamber to another. Notwithstanding\r\nthat many columns of the ants were continually carrying in the cut\r\nleaves, I could never find any quantity of these in the burrows, and it\r\nwas evident that they were used up in some way immediately they were\r\nbrought in. The chambers were always about three-parts filled with a\r\nspeckled brown flocculent, spongy-looking mass of a light and loosely\r\nconnected substance. This mass, which I have called the ant-food, proved\r\non examination to be composed of minutely subdivided pieces of leaves,\r\nwithered to a brown colour and overgrown and lightly connected together\r\nby a minute white fungus that ramified in every direction throughout\r\nit.”[60] Belt assured himself in many ways, but not through actually\r\nseeing them do so, that this fungus was what the ants fed on, and he\r\nadds, “that they do not eat the leaves themselves I convinced myself;\r\nfor I found near the tenanted chambers deserted ones filled with the\r\nrefuse particles of leaves that had been exhausted as manure for the\r\nfungus, and were now left, and served as food for larvæ of\r\n_Staphylinidæ_ and other beetles.”[60]\r\n\r\nBelt’s conclusions have been since amply verified, and the actual\r\nprocess of preparing the leaves and laying down the mushroom-beds, as\r\nwell as the clipping and—if I mistake not—eating of the mushrooms, has\r\nbeen observed. Herr Möller—a German observer who resided for some years\r\nin tropical America—is usually referred to in this connection; but such\r\nextracts from his writings as I have come across are to me less\r\n_convincing_ than the following account of Mr. Edward Tanner, which is\r\ncontained in the _Journal of the Trinidad Field Club_.[61] The\r\nobservations were made with ants in confinement, as were Herr Möller’s\r\nalso, I believe. “Each forager,” says Mr. Tanner, “drops her portion of\r\nleaf in the nest, which is taken up as required by the small workers,\r\nand carried to a clear space in the nest to be cleaned. This is done\r\nwith their mandibles, and if considered too large, it is cut into\r\nsmaller pieces. It is then taken in hand by the larger workers, who lick\r\nit with their tongues. Then comes the most important part, which is\r\nalmost always done by the larger workers, who manipulate it between\r\ntheir mandibles, the ant using her palpi, tongue, three of her legs, and\r\nher antennæ while doing so. It now becomes a small, almost black ball,\r\nvarying in size from a mustard-seed to the finest dust-shot, according\r\nto the size of the piece of leaf that has been manipulated, which varies\r\nfrom ⅛ by ⅛ to ¼ by ¼ of an inch. These balls, really pulp, are then\r\nbuilt on to an edge of the fungus-bed by the larger workers, and are\r\nslightly smoothed down as the work proceeds. The new surface is then\r\nplanted by the smaller workers with slips of the fungus brought from the\r\nolder part of the nest. Each plant is planted separately, and they know\r\nexactly how far apart the plants should be. It sometimes looks as if the\r\nplants had been put in too scantily in places, yet in about forty hours,\r\nif the humidity is regulated, it is all evenly covered with a mantle as\r\nif of very fine snow. It is this fungus they eat, and with small\r\nportions of it the workers feed the larvæ.”\r\n\r\nThe statement herein contained that the ants plant the new portion of\r\ntheir mushroom-bed with slips or plants taken from the already growing\r\nfungus is, as far as I know, new. I do not remember it in Herr Möller’s\r\npaper,[62] who speaks of the _hyphæ_ of the fungus growing through and\r\nround the little leaf-balls within a few hours, but without reference to\r\ntheir being planted, nor is it alluded to by Professor Wheeler, who has\r\nstudied the mushroom-growing ant—whether the same or a similar species I\r\nknow not—in Texas. Forel, again, speaking of an allied form in Colombia,\r\nsays, “The largest workers triturate the leaves”; and again, “the\r\nmedium-sized workers of the minim caste are for ever clipping the\r\nthreads of the fungus, which then develops the ‘Kohlrabi’ (the little\r\nround swellings, that is to say), on which the ants feed.”[62] Possibly\r\nthis last may allude to the planting, but if so, it is the reverse of\r\nclearly put. Professor Wheeler also alludes to this constant clipping of\r\nthe fungus, and sees in it the probable cause of the mutilation of the\r\nantennæ of the little blind cockroaches that live with these ants and\r\ntake toll of their mushrooms.[63] But as these constitute the sole food\r\nof their insect cultivators, it is natural that the latter should\r\nfrequently clip in order to eat them, and the clipping would, no doubt,\r\nstimulate their growth. All this, however, is different from the actual\r\ndeliberate planting of the fungus on newly laid-down portions of the\r\nbed—an act which would imply a very clear intention, and make the ants\r\nfarmers in the same way that we are. This, however, need not be the case\r\nif they only lay down the beds, for these at one time probably\r\nconstituted their actual food, the crop of fungus being merely\r\nincidental. But if the ants deliberately plant the fungus, then, indeed,\r\nthey must know precisely, in a human way, what they are about.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the leaves, from which, in their state of pulp, the\r\nmushrooms spring, are stored up by the ants in large underground\r\nchambers; but these mushroom-beds, or gardens, as they are often called,\r\nare themselves a sort of nest, containing tunnels and chambers, and not\r\nmerely unformed heaps. It is in one or other of these chambers that the\r\nqueen ant of the nest resides, a majestic creature, almost an inch long,\r\nbut inflated both with pride and eggs to a disproportionate extent. Her\r\nsons and virgin daughters, who will some day be queens themselves, keep\r\nher company, whilst all about in the galleries and all over the broad,\r\nflat surface of the garden, which resembles a large flattened sponge,\r\nwalk the different castes of workers, some large, some small, some\r\nmedium-sized, with a few big-headed soldiers here and there amongst\r\nthem, as though to keep the crowd in order. Whether they have really any\r\nsuch duty assigned them we do not know, but they do not appear to do any\r\nwork, whilst the others are all busy at something, and the smaller\r\nworkers particularly keep threading the stalks and filaments of the\r\nfungus in order to weed out any extraneous useless growth from amongst\r\nit.[63]\r\n\r\nIt is a sad reflection—thus sighs Professor Wheeler—that so much ordered\r\nenergy, such apparent intelligence, should all be really due to—_what_\r\nhe does not seem to be quite certain about, not automatism entirely\r\nperhaps, but if not, then semi- or demi-semi-automatism, tempered with\r\n“psychic plasticity.” Against this view of the matter we have that of\r\nBelt, who, after giving two instances, which came under his own\r\nobservation, of intelligent adaptation, on the part of ants, to meet\r\nparticular circumstances, exclaims, “Can it be contended that such\r\ninsects are not able to determine by reasoning powers which is the best\r\nway of doing a thing, or that their actions are not guided by thought\r\nand reflection?”[64] But then Belt was not provided with the term\r\n“psychic plasticity,” and without it he could only infer intelligence\r\nfrom any intelligent act.\r\n\r\nStill it cannot be denied that a great many instances have been\r\ngiven—noticeably in the case of “_our_ ants” by Sir John Lubbock[65]—in\r\nwhich these paragons of insects have behaved very stupidly, or shall we\r\nsay—for why should a creature that cannot be intelligent be stupid\r\neither?—with great “psychic _rigidity_”? Certainly such contradictions\r\nare very puzzling, but I would suggest one way of trying to estimate\r\nbetter the rigid type of ant intellect, which I believe to be absolutely\r\nnew, and that is to compare it not with one’s own brain—or Darwin’s—but\r\nwith that of a rigid type of person. It is wonderful what a difference\r\nthis might make in our conclusions. An ant, for instance, that is\r\nunable, under some special circumstances, to get a thing down into its\r\nnest, because it persists in holding or pulling it, in the way it has\r\nalways been accustomed to, or another that would rather be blown into\r\nthe water along a known road than leave it for a new one, makes a poor\r\nfigure in presence of the seven sages, or amidst a circle of senior\r\nwranglers mentally called up for its confusion; but we should think,\r\nrather, of some pin-headed servant-maid, setting an article of furniture\r\neach morning in the place that, with evident intention, you have removed\r\nit from overnight, or making up a larger and larger fire as the weather\r\ngets warmer and warmer. One should think of the obstinacy with which\r\nmany people cling to old habits which changed times have made useless,\r\nor even harmful, and of how numbers not only prefer inferior things they\r\nare used to, to the most decisive improvements, but hate and revile such\r\nimprovements as though they were undeniable evils. Instances will occur\r\nto everyone. I would rather not mention any for fear of alienating nine\r\nout of every ten of my readers. We should think, also, of savages or\r\nprimitive, slow-moving peoples. What a great unadaptability, for\r\ninstance, did the Matabele show in their methods of encountering our\r\ncountrymen during the war, and throughout the rising; as also in that\r\nrising itself, since it was against all those well-known blessings which\r\nour empire confers upon savages.[66] It is to these less exalted levels\r\nof human faculty that we should look when we seek to compare an ant’s\r\nmind—when out of its usual set track—with our own, if we wish to do the\r\nant any justice. That we pursue an opposite plan is my own explanation\r\nof many a partial verdict. To every experimenter in these directions\r\n(who should happen to ask my advice) I would say, first, “Do you know,\r\nor have you ever known, a really silly person?” and on his beginning, at\r\nonce, with “Yes, Mrs.” or “Miss” (as the case may be), I would strike in\r\nperemptorily thus: “Then keep _her_—not Newton—in your mind as a\r\nstandard of comparison.”\r\n\r\nThat ants should intentionally cultivate mushrooms will appear wonderful\r\nto everybody, and some will see in it the high-water mark of their\r\nmental development, by whatever path it has been arrived at. It seems\r\nnatural to connect such doings with the fact that “in ants the cerebral\r\nganglia are of extraordinary dimensions, and in all the Hymenoptera\r\nthese ganglia are many times larger than in the less intelligent orders,\r\nsuch as beetles.”[67] Yet the brain of an ant—“one of the most\r\nmarvellous atoms of matter in the world, perhaps more so than the brain\r\nof a man”—is “not so large as the quarter of a small pin’s head.”[67] Of\r\nwhat size, then, can a beetle’s be?—especially that family of beetles\r\nwhich grow and cultivate mushrooms, just in the same way that ants do.\r\nIt would be suggestive—though I hardly know of what—should it be found\r\nthat, comparatively speaking, _they_ have no brain at all.\r\n\r\nThe beetles alluded to have been named, with reference to the particular\r\nkind of mushrooms they grow, ambrosia beetles, though in what the great\r\nsuperiority of these over those raised by the ants lies I do not know,\r\nfor no one appears to have tasted them. It has been agreed, however, to\r\ncall them ambrosia. “One of the most remarkable facts,” says Mr.\r\nFroggatt, “is that each group of these beetles is associated with a\r\ncertain kind of ambrosia or fungus, notwithstanding that they are found\r\nin different timbers. This substance is actually cultivated by the\r\nmother beetle upon a carefully prepared layer or bed of wood-débris,\r\ngenerally at the end of the gallery; but in others the ambrosia is grown\r\nonly in certain brood chambers of peculiar construction, whilst in\r\nothers again it is propagated in beds near the cradles of the\r\nlarvæ!”[68] When the latter hatch, they find a supply of celestial food\r\nawaiting them, and can walk about the various galleries, feeding upon it\r\nto their hearts’ content.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, however—that is to say, with other species—social\r\ndevelopment has gone further, and, besides boring galleries, the\r\nmother-beetle excavates a number of cells in their walls, like rows of\r\nbedrooms opening out of either side of a passage. She does not, however,\r\nquite finish her bedrooms, but, whilst they are still incomplete, lays\r\nan egg in each, and when this hatches, the young beetle, then in its\r\nlarval state, takes up the task where she left off, and in time\r\ncompletes it. All the while they are growing up the mother feeds the\r\nyoung ones, and, between the intervals of doing so, stops up the\r\nentrance to the cell with a “plug”—such is the word employed; “to what\r\nbase uses we may return, Horatio!”—of ambrosia. In time, when they have\r\nacquired the full imago form, each female beetle flies away to make a\r\nburrow and rear a family of her own, and in some species she is\r\naccompanied in this marriage flight, as it may be called, by the male.\r\nIn others, however, the males are wingless, and remain in the burrow,\r\ntill, when their appointed time comes, they die. Whether the male, when\r\nwinged, assists the female in her mining operations I am not quite sure,\r\ninasmuch as that point seems to be avoided in the accounts which I have\r\nbeen able to consult, but the wingless male would not be able to do so,\r\nas he would be left behind in the burrow when the female flew away to\r\nfound another colony.\r\n\r\nThe fungus, when it has once commenced to grow, increases very rapidly,\r\nso that if the number of beetles in the nest is much diminished, as,\r\nsay, by some accident, the rest cannot eat enough to keep it down, and\r\nso, it would appear, are suffocated. It is asserted, however, that when\r\nthe wingless males are deserted by the females, and would otherwise\r\nperish in this way, they all collect together in a few of the galleries\r\nand feast on the ambrosia there growing. By this means, we are told,\r\nthey “prolong for a time their useless existence”—an ungrateful way of\r\nputting it, so it seems to me, as the poor things have already been\r\nuseful in a very indispensable manner, so that their existence as a\r\nwhole is anything but useless, and to separate a part of it from the\r\nrest and carp at that is silly as well as ill-natured. But it is the\r\nfashion to speak in this harsh way of the male insect, beginning with\r\nthe drone bee; whereas when the female has done all that _she_ can\r\ndo—which is often just to lay her eggs—nobody talks of _her_ useless\r\nexistence. Fashion is a curious thing, and ants, even if they be\r\nautomatons, are not the only creatures that do things automatically.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly very curious, if it be true, that the wingless male\r\nbeetles should, by thus congregating together in this way, and so saving\r\ntheir lives, show more intelligence than the winged females, who, under\r\nsimilar circumstances, are choked with their ambrosia, as the Duke of\r\nClarence was with his nectar in a malmsey-butt. It is true that with the\r\nmales the thing happens every year, whereas with the females it is only\r\naccidental; but, in the particular circumstances, it is difficult to see\r\nhow inheritance can have had anything to do with it. Here, then, are a\r\nparticular family of beetles who live the same sort of social life that\r\nants and bees do, which discovery appears to have been made by a Mr.\r\nHubbard not so many years ago, and from whose paper on the subject all\r\nthe above particulars have been taken, though only through the medium of\r\nvarious magazines, since even at the British Museum I was unable to get\r\nthe paper itself. So long ago, however, as 1844 a certain Herr Theo\r\nHartig “published an article on the ambrosia of _Xyleborno (Bostrichus)\r\ndispar_, in which he showed that it was a fungus growth (_pilzrasen_),\r\nand he named the fungus _Monilia candida_.” This statement is made by\r\nMr. Hubbard in his much more recent account. Not feeling perfectly\r\ncertain from it whether the origin, as well as the nature, of the\r\nstrange-named substance was not also divined by the German investigator,\r\nI quote the reference in order not to do him a possible injustice, for\r\nto me it seems that there have been few more interesting discoveries\r\nthan this of these ant-like, ambrosia-growing beetles. But why the ants\r\nonly grow mushrooms, thus allowing themselves to be enormously outdone\r\nby an inferior insect, is more than I can understand.\r\n\r\nAnd now a word of justice to these beetles. It might be supposed that,\r\nby burrowing into trees, they caused the death of the latter, but this\r\nis not really the case. Writing in _The Agricultural Gazette_ of New\r\nSouth Wales for August, 1900, Mr. Froggatt, the Government Entomologist,\r\nmakes the following statement absolving _Xleborus_: “This curious little\r\nbeetle (_X. solidus_) is rather plentiful about Sydney, and is\r\nfrequently sent to us taken out of the trunks of fruit trees, which it\r\nis supposed to have killed; but in all cases that have come under my\r\nnotice it has had nothing to do with the tree dying, but is attracted to\r\nthe tree as soon as it becomes sick, the bark begins to wither, and the\r\nfirst symptoms of decay set in.” Mr. Froggatt adds: “The instinct that\r\nleads these and other wood-boring beetles to a tree as soon as it is\r\nsick is something marvellous; in the tropics I have collected many fine,\r\nrare species upon the freshly cut tent-poles in our camp, attracted to\r\nthe wood, but otherwise seldom found in the bush.” This instinct would\r\nseem to be a remarkably developed scent, though why a severed branch\r\nshould smell differently from the tree of which it but a moment before\r\nmade a part it is not easy to imagine. However, we cannot, without\r\nevidence, attribute clairvoyance to beetles, and perhaps it is the cut\r\nfrom which the scent emanates.\r\n\r\nAnother example of an insect which is neither an ant, bee, wasp, nor\r\nwhite ant, but which yet may be said to live a true social life, is the\r\nlittle creature which, under the name of _Psocus venosus_ and as\r\nbelonging to the order _Carrodentia_, will be familiar to everyone. It\r\nis nearly related to the so-called book-lice, but lives in the open air,\r\n“being seen,” says Mr. Leland Howard, “upon the trunks of trees, in\r\nflocks numbering from twelve to forty or fifty individuals.”[69] These\r\nbrowse together like a herd of miniature cattle on the various lichens\r\nthat embrace the bark, and these they nibble so closely that wherever\r\nthey move they leave a bare track behind them. Sometimes one family and\r\nsometimes several are included in the herd, all ages and stages being\r\nrepresented, from the wingless but free-moving larvæ to the winged imago\r\nform. The latter, however, though they be thus provided, will not\r\nreadily forsake their young, but the whole of them, when alarmed, first\r\nrun all together, and then, if the cause of disquietude continue,\r\nsuddenly scatter as though in panic, and run hither and thither, in all\r\nand every direction. When the danger seems over, they close up their\r\nranks again, and go on browsing as before.\r\n\r\nThe female _Psocus_ lays her eggs in little clusters of from fifteen to\r\ntwenty, and protects each cluster under a sort of dome or shield of\r\ngnawed wood which she presses upon them so that they stick to it. She is\r\nsaid to brood over the eggs, but this does not appear to mean that she\r\nactually incubates them. Rather, she remains about, keeping watchful\r\nguard till they are hatched, and then takes the young to find pasture,\r\nwalking at their head like a hen in front of her chickens. From such\r\nbeginnings as these it seems possible that the social life of ants has\r\nbeen, in the course of ages, evolved and developed.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 60:\r\n\r\n  Belt, The Naturalist in Nicaragua, pp. 72, 73, 79-81.\r\n\r\nFootnote 61:\r\n\r\n  Journal of the Trinidad Field Club, No. 3.\r\n\r\nFootnote 62:\r\n\r\n  As quoted in The American Naturalist for November, 1900.\r\n\r\nFootnote 63:\r\n\r\n  The American Naturalist, November, 1900.\r\n\r\nFootnote 64:\r\n\r\n  Belt, The Naturalist in Nicaragua, pp. 27, 28.\r\n\r\nFootnote 65:\r\n\r\n  Lubbock, Ants, Bees, and Wasps.\r\n\r\nFootnote 66:\r\n\r\n  The greatest being speedy extinction.\r\n\r\nFootnote 67:\r\n\r\n  Darwin, The Descent of Man, p. 54.\r\n\r\nFootnote 68:\r\n\r\n  The Agricultural Gazette of New South Wales, March, 1900.\r\n\r\nFootnote 69:\r\n\r\n  Leland O.

The particular fungus,\r\nthat is to say, which for some unaccountable reason has received this\r\nname, appeared as a natural growth upon the walls of their tunnels, and\r\nin time it came to be thought necessary, and its coming was arranged\r\nfor. By similar steps, probably, the leaves once carried as food to\r\ntheir nests by the sauba ants, or cooshies, have become the soil merely\r\non which that food is grown; and so I have no doubt myself that even if\r\nthe present agricultural ants of Texas do not purposely sow and\r\nafterwards reap the rice that springs up around the circular mound of\r\ntheir domicile, their descendants will do so. Indeed, it seems rather\r\ncurious that, with such facilities for a gradual development, the habit\r\nhas not yet been acquired; and this is the chief reason which inclines\r\nme to suspend judgment on the question, and wait for further\r\nobservations. Far from thinking the thing too wonderful, I wonder if it\r\nbe not the case. Such wonder, however, is for ants and not for beetles,\r\nexcept, indeed, ambrosia beetles, who certainly merit it, though in an\r\nopposite way. No other wood-borers of the order are anything but\r\nwood-eaters, or, at any rate, if a few feed on fungus, as would not be\r\nimprobable, should it happen to appear, they have nothing to do with the\r\ncultivation of it. The words “as far as we know,” however, must be added\r\nto the foregoing statement. Numbers of beetles pass the larval and pupal\r\nstage of their existence within the trunk of a decaying or even of a\r\nperfectly sound tree, from which they issue after the final\r\nmetamorphosis has been made. Amongst these is our own stag-beetle, in\r\nwhom, that is to say in whose caterpillar, some suppose themselves to\r\nsee the _Cossus_ of the ancient Romans, which was as much appreciated by\r\nthem, and, no doubt, justly, as are earthworms by the Chinese. Others,\r\nhowever, believe this to have been the large red meaty-looking\r\ncaterpillar of the goat-moth; and as the one conjecture is quite as\r\nplausible as the other, the only, or, at any rate, the best way of\r\narriving at a conclusion would be to try them both—a simple plan which,\r\nas far as I know, has not yet been adopted.\r\n\r\nThe stag-beetle—when of maximum size, that is to say, for it varies\r\namazingly in this respect—is much the largest beetle which this our\r\nisland possesses, but though, with its huge, antler-like jaws, it makes\r\na good perennial illustration for all books of popular entomology, its\r\nmerits seem to end there, for either there is nothing or nothing has yet\r\nbeen observed particularly interesting about it. No doubt, if we look at\r\nthe matter from an absolute rather than a relative point of view, the\r\nsecond of these two explanations is the correct one, for a creature has\r\nonly to be studied in order to become interesting; but as compared with\r\nants, bees, wasps, and many other insects, beetles, or, at any rate, the\r\nvast majority of them, are not so very entertaining in their habits, and\r\nthe stag-beetle has no superiority in this respect to correspond with\r\nits size and uncommon appearance. This appearance, however, is confined\r\nto the male, who alone possesses the great branching mandibles on which\r\nits greater size also is largely dependent. It would be natural to\r\nsuppose that these formidable weapons, as they certainly appear, stood\r\nin relation to the combats of the males for the possession of the\r\nfemales, yet it is often stated that the short, sharp pincers of the\r\nlatter, which can be made, it would seem—anyone who doubts may try—to\r\nmeet in the flesh, are really the more efficient of the two. Be this as\r\nit may, it is not improbable that the stag-beetle’s jaws, since they are\r\nvery handsome, may have been developed less as weapons than as\r\nornaments, under the laws of sexual selection. Darwin, if I remember,\r\nwas doubtfully of this opinion, and he attributes many strange\r\nprojections and processes on the head or thorax of other beetles—as\r\nnotably that huge one with a snout like a weaver’s beam, called the\r\nHercules beetle—to the same agency. No use for this extraordinary trunk,\r\nas one may term it, has as yet been discovered, but as the under portion\r\nis covered with a thick matting of soft brown hairs, it would seem as\r\nthough it had some office to perform, unless indeed we suppose this\r\n_chevelure_ to be likewise admired. A lesser, though still tremendous,\r\nprojection, starting from the head, as the other one does from the\r\nthorax, is likewise unaccounted for, for though the two together make in\r\nappearance a pair of uncouth and irregular pincers, they neither are,\r\nnor apparently can be used in this way. Nothing appears to be known of\r\nthis strange creature’s habits, and the same may be said in regard to\r\nmost of the more remarkable-looking beetles of the world, as well as\r\nthose which are not so extraordinary in their appearance. The ways of\r\nbeetles, in fact, have been but little studied, and it is perhaps not\r\ntoo much to say that if for every thousand that fill the show-cases in\r\nmuseums we could know the life-history of one, we might with infinite\r\nadvantage, in exchange for this knowledge, throw the whole pin-forest of\r\nthem into the sea. In what light this fact, if true, exhibits the\r\nlabours of those naturalists—as the world calls them—who, living for\r\nyears amidst the life-teeming regions of the earth, have spent their\r\nwhole time in constantly killing and killing, coming home, at last, with\r\nan acre of carcasses, to write a book containing hardly anything of\r\nfirst-hand observation—the soul of natural history—I will not pause to\r\ninquire.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HERCULES BEETLE.\r\nThe enormous beetle from which this illustration was drawn, though not a\r\nparticularly large specimen, is six inches long, and the upper jaw\r\nmeasures three inches and a half.]\r\n\r\nThere are many other species of beetles, the males of which are\r\nornamented about the head and thorax with all sorts of knobs and\r\nprojections, so that, with some, one might think that a one-horned or\r\ntwo-horned rhinoceros had undergone metempsychosis, as it is called,\r\nthat its soul, that is to say, had transmigrated into the body of an\r\ninsect, which latter had been fashioned so as fancifully to resemble its\r\nold one. However, as this would be a downward journey, it is more\r\nsatisfactory to imagine that certain beetles have been “translated” into\r\nrhinoceroses. As to these kinds of excrescences, Darwin believed them to\r\nbe of the nature of adornments, and since their owners—the males—have\r\nnot been seen to use them in warfare, and indeed do not appear to fight,\r\nit is difficult to imagine any other _raison d’être_ for them. This\r\nseems all the more likely because certain flies found in the Malay\r\nArchipelago have likewise excrescences, which we have to call horns, and\r\nthese too are confined to the males, though it is hardly to be imagined\r\nthat they would fight in a manner to make them of service. These flies\r\nmust be most extraordinary creatures to look at. They have long legs,\r\nwhich they draw together underneath them, so as to stand very high, and\r\ntheir horns are not only conspicuous by their size and shape, but also\r\nby being brightly coloured. Thus in one species they are a beautiful\r\npink with a light stripe down the centre, and bordered on each side with\r\nblack. In another the colours are yellow, black, and brown, and though\r\n_Elaphomia cervicornis_ has to be contented with black, and pale tips,\r\nyet his are the finest pair of all, being nearly as long as his body,\r\nand branched so as to look like a pair of slender and delicate stag’s\r\nhorns. The other pairs are not like this, one of them being rather\r\nclub-shaped, and therefore less horn-like, whilst another has an\r\nextraordinary resemblance to the antlers of an elk, which are broad and\r\npalmated, so that _it_ is the _Elaphomia alcicornis_. Here, therefore,\r\nare both horned beetles and horned flies who yet do not fight with their\r\nhorns, so that unless they serve as ornaments it would be a puzzle to\r\nsay what they do serve as; for as the male beetles do not fight, which\r\nis the principal way in which male creatures, including man, show their\r\nvigour, why should we suppose them to be more vigorous than the females?\r\n\r\nIn some other beetles, which do fight, the sexes do not differ\r\nconspicuously, nor do their facial or other peculiarities appear to bear\r\nany special relation to warfare. Thus “those curious little beetles, the\r\n_Brenthidæ_” of the Malay Archipelago, have an extraordinarily long\r\nsnout—or rostrum, to talk entomologically—at the end of which come the\r\njaws and antennæ, and this rostrum is used by the female to bore holes\r\nin decaying wood, where she afterwards deposits her eggs. The males,\r\nhowever, do what they can with them as weapons, and Dr. Wallace has seen\r\ntwo of them fighting together in a very comic manner. “Each,” he tells\r\nus, “had a fore-leg laid across the neck of the other, and the rostrum\r\nbent quite in an attitude of defiance, and looking most ridiculous.”[70]\r\nOn another occasion “two were fighting for a female, who stood close by\r\nbusy at her boring. They pushed at each other with their rostra, and\r\nclawed and thumped, apparently in the greatest rage, although their\r\ncoats of mail must have saved both from injury. The small one, however,\r\nsoon ran away, acknowledging himself vanquished.”[70] _Lethrus\r\ncephalotes_ is another fighting beetle, and here the males, instead of\r\nhorns or anything extraordinary, have merely somewhat larger mandibles\r\nthan the females. “The two sexes,” says Darwin, “inhabit the same\r\nburrow. If, during the breeding season, a strange male attempts to enter\r\nthe burrow he is attacked; the female does not remain passive, but\r\ncloses the mouth of the burrow and encourages her mate by continually\r\npushing him on from behind; and the battle lasts until the aggressor is\r\nkilled or runs away.”[71]\r\n\r\nOf yet another species, the _Ateuchus cicatricosus_, the sexes “live in\r\npairs, and seem much attached to each other; the male excites the female\r\nto roll the balls of dung in which the ova are deposited, and if she is\r\nremoved he becomes much agitated. If the male is removed the female\r\nceases all work, and, as M. Brulerie believes, would remain on the same\r\nspot until she died.”[72] But M. Brulerie was reckoning apparently\r\nwithout M. Fabre, since whose investigations in this last department it\r\nmay be said that “_nous avons changé tout cela_.” For this _Ateuchus_ is\r\nnone other than the celebrated Scarabæus, or sacred beetle, and, in the\r\nfirst place, M. Fabre has shown that the balls of dung, which are rolled\r\nabout by them with so much perseverance and energy, do not contain the\r\nova, as it was always thought that they did, but are merely provender\r\nand nothing more, and though sometimes they are rolled by two beetles\r\ntogether, these are not the male and female, or, at any rate, they need\r\nnot be. They are just as likely to be two males or two females, and in\r\nany case, though the two may be of opposite sexes, they do not represent\r\na mated pair. Simply when the two—if, as is by no means always the case,\r\nmore than one take part in the rolling—have pulled and pushed the ball\r\nto a suitable place, they make a hole in the ground, into which they\r\ndrag it, and, having closed the aperture, sit and feast at their\r\nleisure.\r\n\r\nAccording to Fabre the vital principle contained in the egg would be\r\ndestroyed were it rolled about in this fashion, so when the mother\r\nScarabæus, who, it would appear, works in this matter alone, is ready to\r\nlay her eggs, she first makes an excavation, and then brings the dung\r\ndown into it in pellets, till there is a heap of it, which fills the\r\nwhole concern. Then “the first thing to do is to select very carefully,\r\ntaking what is most delicate for the inner layers, upon which the larva\r\nwill feed, and the coarser for the outer ones, which merely serve as a\r\nprotecting shell. There around a central hollow which receives the egg\r\nthe materials must be arranged layer after layer, according to their\r\ndecreasing fineness and nutritive value; the strata must be made\r\nconsistent, and adhere one to another; and finally the bits of fibre in\r\nthe outside crust, which has to protect the whole thing, must be felted\r\ntogether.”[73]\r\n\r\nThus, when the grub first issues from the egg, it finds light digestible\r\nfood ready to hand, which becomes coarser and more fibrous with its\r\ngrowth and increased capacity of assimilating such stronger diet. As\r\nmore and more is eaten, the ball, which is about the size of an ordinary\r\napple, becomes hollower and hollower, till at last, when only the outer\r\ncrust remains, the grub is ready to enter upon that wonderful series of\r\nchanges—called its metamorphoses—which will bring it forth into this\r\nlarger ball of dirt, a complete beetle, with a useful profession, that\r\nof scavenger, immediately open to it.\r\n\r\nThus a fallacy which, according to Fabre, dates from the time of the\r\nPharaohs, viz. that every ball of dung which one might at any time see a\r\nScarabæus beetle rolling and trundling along contained its egg, has been\r\nfinally disposed of, nor is this the only one. It used to be thought,\r\nnot only that any two beetles rolling a ball between them were male and\r\nfemale, but also that any single one that happened to be in difficulties\r\nwould immediately fly off and summon a comrade or two to its aid. Fabre\r\ndenies this altogether, and maintains that in this rolling away of\r\nprovisions each individual beetle is purely a self-seeker. It is true,\r\nas we have seen, that the _bonne bouche_ will often be eaten by two\r\nScarabæi—never more—in the cavern prepared beforehand for its reception,\r\nbut, according to Fabre, this is only because it is to the mutual\r\ninterest of both to act in this way, since neither can succeed in\r\nappropriating the ball to itself, in spite of efforts—which in other\r\ncases, however, may be successful—to do so.\r\n\r\nIn all such cases the one beetle is the real owner of the ball, whilst\r\nthe other is only there with the intention of stealing it if he can.\r\nThus the thief will often let himself be pushed along by the honest\r\nworker, lying flat on the ball, and doing no work whatever, though at\r\nother times, when a rise in the ground makes it difficult for a single\r\nbeetle to roll it, he will assist with all his power. Again, whilst the\r\none Scarabæus is hollowing out a cave for the approaching banquet to\r\ntake place in, the other, left with the ball, will, after some time,\r\nbegin to go off with it alone, and unless pursued by the owner before he\r\nhas gone too far, he accomplishes his purpose, and eats it all himself.\r\nThus he has associated himself to the maker of the ball with the\r\ndistinct idea of stealing it if he can. He has this plot in his mind, to\r\npretend partnership, to even give real assistance, but to watch his\r\nopportunity and decamp when it occurs. That, at least, is the view\r\nsuggested for our adoption, but I cannot say that it recommends itself\r\nto me. Fabre, in my opinion, has disposed of one error only to fall into\r\nanother of precisely the same kind. He says very justly in regard to the\r\nidea that one beetle would deliberately fly away and summon others to\r\nits assistance, “It is no slight thing to admit that an insect has a\r\ntruly surprising grasp of the situation, and a facility for\r\ncommunicating its ideas to others of its kind more surprising still. Are\r\nwe to suppose that a Scarabæus in distress conceives the idea of begging\r\nfor help, flies off, explores the country round, etc.?” Very true; but\r\nif we are not to suppose this, I certainly will not suppose, either,\r\nthat this same Scarabæus can conceive the idea of pretending to assist\r\nanother in order to rob him of his property. This would be as deep a\r\nlaid scheme as the other, and the facts of the case, as given by Fabre\r\nhimself, do not appear to me to lend themselves to such an explanation.\r\n\r\nThe point of these interesting relations has been, in my opinion,\r\nentirely missed. What we really see in them, or what, at least, is there\r\nfor us to see, is the beginnings of order and social polity, evolving\r\nthemselves out of lawlessness and the strong hand. Further, it has\r\nalready gone some little way, for the fact that two Scarabæi do, as a\r\nmatter of fact, assist each other very materially in rolling the ball,\r\nand that they do sit and eat it together in the same chamber, are not to\r\nbe got over by any such amusing fancy picture as this brilliant writer,\r\nas well as keen observer, has given us. It is no use fixing our eyes\r\nupon that part of the conduct of the beetle which we are invited to call\r\nthe thief, in contradistinction to the owner—I doubt myself if Fabre has\r\nalways kept the two distinct from beginning to end—if we pass over the\r\nother and much more interesting parts of it. Why does this beetle help\r\nto get the ball up a hill, and why does he sit for some considerable\r\ntime with it outside the cave that the other is making, before he begins\r\nto go off with it? Does he say to himself, in the first case, “If we\r\ndon’t get it to the right place, to begin with, he’ll never dig a hole\r\nand leave me outside with it,” and, in the second, “I’ll wait till he\r\nhas come out and found it all right, several times, so that his\r\nsuspicions may be put to sleep”? This would be scheming with a\r\nvengeance; but _serviteur Monsieur Fabre_, I must refer you to your own\r\nincredulity in another matter. I will never accept such an explanation,\r\nand the view which I take of the whole affair is this. The beetle which\r\nFabre calls the thief is under the sway probably of precisely the same\r\nfeeling as the other one—the rightful owner. He has seized a piece of\r\ndung, and as he seizes it, whether another has it at the time or not, it\r\nappears to be his, that being the only idea of rightful ownership which\r\nis not too large for his comprehension. Finding, however, that another\r\nbeetle has exactly the same idea as himself, he is forced, willy\r\nnilly—and the experience is being constantly repeated—to accommodate\r\nhimself to this circumstance and make the best of it. The ball—this is\r\nthe one great advantage—will continue to roll even if he does not push\r\nit. Therefore he can afford to be lazy sometimes, and be pushed along\r\nwith it. The ball stops: in that case he must push it, and, even without\r\nthis incentive, it would appear from Fabre’s account that the two often\r\nwork together. Thus, from the very necessities of the case, it is\r\nevident that a sense of partnership—at least a feeling of doing work in\r\ncombination with another—has begun to dawn in the mind of the Scarabæus.\r\nThe fact that when the one beetle is left alone with the ball, whilst\r\nthe other excavates, it does not immediately go off, but stays a little,\r\nas though waiting to be rejoined, suggests to my mind that this feeling,\r\nfostered by custom, has already gone some way, though it is not\r\nwonderful that, after a time, the primitive individualistic tendency\r\nshould again assert itself. But when the fugitive is overtaken, it\r\nassists the other to roll the ball back, and the end of it all is a meal\r\nshared peacefully between the two, in one common apartment. If we\r\nsuppose that the instinct, or capacity, of working together for some\r\ncommon end has had any beginning, surely we might expect to find it in\r\nsome such state of affairs as this. The result of primitive conceptions\r\nis that two Scarabæi are often obliged to roll one ball between them,\r\nand if there be any advantage in this arrangement, natural selection\r\nwill no doubt do the rest. That it has already begun to do it is, I\r\nthink, very probable; but Fabre was not an evolutionist.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 70:\r\n\r\n  The Malay Archipelago.\r\n\r\nFootnote 71:\r\n\r\n  Darwin, The Descent of Man, p. 300.\r\n\r\nFootnote 72:\r\n\r\n  The Malay Archipelago.\r\n\r\nFootnote 73:\r\n\r\n  Souvenirs Entomologiques.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\n    Do ants sow and reap?—Rival observers—The Texan _v._\r\n      Macaulay’s schoolboy—More evidence wanted—How ants cross\r\n      rivers—Tubular bridges—Ant armies—A world in flight—Living\r\n      nests—Ants and plants—Mutual dependence—Nests in thorns and\r\n      tubers—Ant honey-pots—Business humanity—Burial customs—A\r\n      strange observation—Two views of ants.\r\n\r\nMUSHROOM-GROWING, especially if the ants plant the mushrooms in the way\r\nstated by Mr. Tanner, is just as extraordinary, I think, as their habit\r\nof planting a field with ant-rice and reaping it at the proper time\r\nwould be, did they really practise it. Up to a little while ago it\r\ncertainly seemed as though they did, for there was Dr. Lincecum’s\r\ndefinite statement based upon twelve years’ observation, and this, if\r\nnot confirmed by Mr. McCook, was, at any rate, not contradicted by him.\r\nOn the contrary, McCook mentioned a good many facts pointing in the\r\ndirection of Lincecum’s assertion, and though he did not consider them\r\ndecisive, he could see no reason why the ants should not act in this\r\nway, as indeed there is none: so that as he had only stayed a few months\r\nwhere Lincecum had lived for twelve years, he seemed like a weaker\r\nwitness supporting, according to his opportunities of observation, a\r\nmuch stronger one. Now, however, comes another witness, whose\r\nopportunities have also been great, and in a somewhat heavy-handed way,\r\nin a spirit of myth-slaying and irrelevant reference to supposed\r\nschoolboy knowledge, hardly required in face of all that ants are known\r\nto do, denies the whole thing.\r\n\r\nFirst, however, let us have the assertion as originally made by\r\nLincecum, which is, that on the summit of the mound of their nests, from\r\nwhich they carefully clear away all other vegetation, the harvesting\r\nants sow the seed of a certain plant called ant-rice for the purpose of\r\nsubsequently reaping a harvest of the grain. It is sown in time for the\r\nautumnal rains to bring up, and at the beginning of November a green row\r\nor ring of ant-rice, about four inches wide, is seen springing up round\r\nthe circumference of the _disk_ (as the circular top of the mound is,\r\nfor some reason, always called). In the vicinity of this circular ring\r\nthe ants do not permit a single spire of any other grass or weed to\r\nremain a day, but leave the aristida or ant-rice untouched until it\r\nripens, which occurs in June of the next year. After the maturing and\r\nharvesting of the seed, the dry stubble is cut away and removed from the\r\ndisk, which is thus left unencumbered until the ensuing autumn, when the\r\nsame species of grass again appears as before, and so on.[74] After\r\nstating in a letter to Darwin that he has seen all this taking place\r\nyear after year, Dr. Lincecum adds:—“There can be no doubt of the fact\r\nthat the particular species of grain-bearing grass mentioned above is\r\nintentionally planted. In farmer-like manner the ground upon which it\r\nstands is carefully divested of all other grasses and weeds during the\r\ntime it is growing. When it is ripe the grain is taken care of, the dry\r\nstubble cut away and carried off, the paved area being left unencumbered\r\nuntil the ensuing autumn, when the same ant-rice reappears within the\r\nsame circle and receives the same agricultural attention as was bestowed\r\nupon the previous crop, and so on year after year, as I _know_ to be the\r\ncase in all situations where the ants’ settlements are protected from\r\ngraminivorous animals.”[75] Lincecum also believed that the ants were\r\nable in some way to prevent the seed stored in their nests from\r\ngerminating. This same fact has been asserted, and apparently proved, by\r\nMoggridge, in regard to the harvesting ant of southern Europe, and he\r\nalso states that, if in spite of the precaution any seeds begin to\r\nsprout, the ants by gnawing off the tips of the radicles would prevent\r\nthe germination from proceeding.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the case _for_ the harvesting ant, as we may say; for if\r\nthese things be true they are certainly much to its credit, whereas, if\r\nnot, the scandal is so great that it ought to change its name. Let us\r\nnow hear the case against, as stated by Professor Wheeler, after which\r\nreaders may make up their minds, if they can, for I have not quite done\r\nso yet. I quote in full, so that the two statements may be balanced\r\nagainst each other, and this, I hope, will be more interesting than the\r\nusual “Mr. So and So, however, disputes this and thinks, etc.”—another\r\nline or two in which the contrary proposition of the one before is\r\nstated at about the same length. This is what Professor Wheeler, who\r\n“speaks home—you may relish him more (or at least as much) in the\r\nsoldier as the scholar”—has to say: “It may not be altogether out of\r\nplace in this paper to record a few other observations on _Pogonomyrmex\r\nmolifacieus_, inasmuch as this form has been singled out among all the\r\nknown members of the genus as presenting certain remarkable instincts.\r\nLincecum is responsible for the myth that this _Pogonomyrmex_ sows a\r\ncertain species of grass, the ‘ant-rice’ (_Aristida oligantha_),\r\nprotects it from harm and frees it from weeds while it is growing, for\r\nthe purpose of reaping the grain. This notion, which even the Texan\r\nschoolboy (not Macaulay’s, who probably knew as much about it) has come\r\nto regard as a joke, has been widely cited, largely because the great\r\nDarwin stood sponsor for its publication in the Journal of the Linnean\r\nSociety. McCook, after spending a few weeks in Texas observing the ant\r\nin question and recording his observations in a book of 310 pages,\r\nfailed to obtain any evidence either for or against the Lincecum myth\r\nand merely succeeded in extending its vogue by admitting its\r\nplausibility. Two years of nearly continuous observation enable me to\r\nsuggest the probable source of Lincecum’s and McCook’s misconceptions.\r\nIn either case the observer has started with a few facts, and has then\r\nstopped short to draw inferences before gathering more facts. If the\r\nnests of _Molifacieus_ be studied during the cool winter months—and this\r\nis the only time to study them leisurely and comfortably, since the cold\r\nsubdues the fiery stings of their inhabitants—the seeds which the ants\r\nhave garnered in many of their chambers will often be found to have\r\nsprouted. It is, therefore, certain that these ants are not able to\r\nprevent the seed from germinating, as Moggridge claims for the European\r\nspecies of Messar, except by conveying them to drier chambers; and in\r\nprotracted spells of wet weather even this precaution seems to be of no\r\navail. On sunny days the ants may often be seen removing these seeds\r\nwhen they have sprouted too far to be left for food, and carrying them\r\nto the refuse heap, which is always at the extremity of the cleared\r\nearthern disk or mound. In this place the seeds thus cast away as\r\ninedible often take root, and, somewhat later, form an arc of tall grass\r\nmore or less closely approximating to a complete circle round the nest.\r\nSince these ants feed largely, though by no means exclusively, on\r\ngrass-seeds, and since these particular seeds are a very common and\r\nfavourite article of food, it is easy to see how their grass should\r\noften predominate in the circle. In reality, however, only a small\r\npercentage of the nests, and only those situated in certain localities,\r\npresent such circles. Now to state that the ant, like a provident\r\nfarmer, sows this cereal, and guards and weeds it for the sake of\r\ngarnering its grain, is as absurd as to say that the family cook is\r\nplanting and maintaining an orchard when some of the peach-stones which\r\nshe has carelessly thrown into the backyard, with the other kitchen\r\nrefuse, chance to grow into peach trees.”[75] Certainly such a thing\r\nshould have been observed before the statement was made, and, if it has\r\nnot been, the facts seem more probably accounted for on the above\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nProfessor Wheeler goes on to say that “there are several other facts\r\nwhich show that the special ring of grass about the nest is an\r\nunintentional and inconstant result of the activities of the ant colony.\r\nFor instance, one often finds very flourishing ant-colonies that have\r\nexisted for years in the midst of much-travelled roads, or in stone\r\nside-walls, often a hundred or more feet from any vegetation whatever\r\n(without any ant-rice on their mounds therefore). Again, it is very\r\nevident that even a complete circle of grass like those described by\r\nLincecum and McCook would be entirely inadequate to supply more than a\r\nvery small fraction of the grain necessary for the support of a\r\nflourishing colony of these ants. Hence they are always obliged to make\r\nlong trips into the surrounding vegetation, and thereby wear out regular\r\npaths, which radiate in different directions, often to a distance of\r\nforty to sixty feet from the entrance of the nest. The existence of\r\nthese paths, which are often found in connection with grass-encircled\r\nnests, is alone sufficient to disprove Lincecum’s statements.”[75] It\r\ncertainly seems easier to suppose that Lincecum misinterpreted certain\r\nfacts, not themselves in dispute, than that an explanation on which so\r\nmany considerations seem to throw doubt is the correct one. One thing,\r\nat least, seems certain—if some of these ant communities grow grain of\r\nset purpose, all of them do not. This may be possible, but more proof of\r\nit than Lincecum has brought is demanded. If the ants really sow and\r\nreap the grain that grows upon their mounds, and, more especially, if\r\nthey carefully keep the patch clear, it ought not to be difficult to see\r\nthem doing so. This last would be decisive, whereas the other two are by\r\nno means so.\r\n\r\nThat ants should use their own larvæ like a shuttle, and for the same\r\npurpose, seems as strange a thing as one can well imagine, but there is\r\nno doubt at all about it, the act having been witnessed on various\r\noccasions by competent observers, whose evidence is mutually\r\ncorroborated. The species in question is common in Eastern Asia, and is\r\naccustomed to make little houses or arbours for itself by bending leaves\r\nround so that the edges meet, and then fixing them together, as some\r\ncaterpillars do. Now the larva can do something which the grown ant\r\ncannot, which is to spin a cocoon from a sort of gummy, thread-like\r\nsubstance which issues from the mouth. Whilst one group of ants\r\ntherefore join to keep the leaf bent in the proper position, another\r\ntake each a larva in their jaws, and pass it from edge to edge of the\r\nleaf, applying its mouth to each edge, until the two are bound firmly\r\ntogether.[76] Whether this is a more or less remarkable habit than\r\ngrowing mushrooms it would be difficult, perhaps, to decide, nor is\r\nthere any need to try, since such questions are more interesting left\r\nuncertain.\r\n\r\nIt is well known, or at least credibly asserted, that ants cross rivers\r\nby clinging one to another from the branch of a tree overhanging the\r\nwater, till the end of this living chain, as it becomes longer and\r\nlonger, is carried by the force of the current to the opposite bank,\r\nwhere a bridge is formed, over which the main body marches.[77]\r\nAccording to Du Chaillu the ants in Africa make, not only a bridge, but\r\na tunnel—“a high, safe tubular bridge through which the whole vast\r\nregiment marches in regular order.”[78] These are the celebrated driver\r\nor bashikouay ants, who, when upon their terrible marauding marches, put\r\nevery living creature, including man, to flight, though for many flight\r\nis in vain. Size and strength are here no protection. “The elephant and\r\ngorilla fly before them; the black men run for their lives.” So says Du\r\nChaillu, and, sure enough, when the skins of some of the poor gorillas\r\nhe shot arrived in England, several of these ants were found amongst the\r\nhair.[79] In the forests of equatorial Africa, abounding—if they have\r\nnot all been shot by this time—with large animals, these hunting-raids\r\nmust give rise to some stirring scenes. What crashings through the trees\r\nand undergrowth! What uncouth sounds, perhaps, of mingled pain and rage!\r\nHow a bitten gorilla would express himself! What a subject for a picture\r\nif a herd of elephants, a few families of gorillas, a score or so of\r\nlions, with a few leopards, and baboons, perhaps a rhinoceros, and any\r\nnumber of antelopes, were all to come rushing down together to where an\r\nartist stood ready for them! I should like to see the picture he would\r\ndraw.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PURSUED BY DRIVER ANTS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n The greatest beasts of the forest will fly before these terrible little\r\n                                 insects,\r\n              one of which is shown in the left-hand corner.\r\n\r\nA more remarkable sight even than an ant-bridge is perhaps an ant-nest,\r\nby which I mean, not an ants’ nest in the ordinary sense of the term,\r\nbut a nest made of ants. The following quotation from the\r\nmuch-containing _Naturalist in Nicaragua_, page 25, will explain this\r\nhard saying. “They make their temporary habitations in hollow trees, and\r\nsometimes underneath large fallen trunks that offer suitable hollows. A\r\nnest that I came across in the latter situation was open at one side.\r\nThe ants were clustered together in a dense mass like a great swarm of\r\nbees hanging from the roof, but reaching to the ground below. Their\r\ninnumerable long legs looked like brown threads binding together the\r\nmass, which must have been at least a cubic yard in bulk, and contained\r\nhundreds of thousands of individuals, although many columns were\r\noutside, some bringing in the pupæ of ants, others the legs and\r\ndissected bodies of various insects. I was surprised to see in this\r\nliving nest tubular passages leading down to the centre of the mass,\r\nkept open just as if it had been formed of inorganic materials. Down\r\nthese holes the ants who were bringing in booty passed with their prey.”\r\nOf the many curiously constructed or strangely produced dwellings of\r\nants, this made out of their own bodies is amongst the most remarkable.\r\n\r\nMany ants live in the interior of various plants. The plant generally\r\nbenefits as much as the insect by this arrangement, so that there is a\r\nmutual dependence between the two, which in some cases is carried to\r\nsuch an extent that the life of one or both seems a necessary part of\r\nthat of the other. In Borneo, for instance, a certain large tuber which\r\ngrows on the branches of aged trees is always found inhabited by a\r\ncertain red ant, of small size, but fierce disposition, which rushes out\r\nand attacks anyone who ventures at all near its dwelling. The seed of\r\nthis tuber is disseminated in the same way as is our own mistletoe,\r\nthrough the agency of birds, that is to say, the seed being surrounded\r\nby a similar pulpy mass, which adheres to the branch on which it falls.\r\nSoon after germination the tuber, which is shaped something like a\r\ncarrot, begins to develop, but whilst still quite small its growth\r\nceases and in this state it would remain, and before long, die, if it\r\nshould not happen to be found by the ants in question. If it should be,\r\nhowever, its life is assured. They immediately bore a hole at the base\r\nof the stem, upon which this enlarges to a great degree, so that soon\r\nthere is room for them to excavate galleries in the cellular tissue of\r\nthe interior, and to form a populous colony. The whole tuber is soon\r\nperforated in all directions, and becomes a living and growing\r\nformicarium, the great accretion of cellular tissue which has made this\r\npossible having been caused by the poison—if we may call it so—of the\r\nant’s bite, in the same way as the sting of the gall-fly raises galls\r\nupon the oak.[80] Of course, from the moment that the ants appear the\r\ntuber is safe from any other insect, or small bird, or mammal that might\r\notherwise do it harm. The ants in defending their nest would defend it,\r\nand it is on this principle of mutual advantage that such ant and plant\r\nalliances have been brought about.\r\n\r\nThus the dry, arid plains, called savannahs, of tropical America support\r\na species of acacia of which the thorns, characteristic of the family,\r\ngrow in pairs and are shaped exactly like the horns of some oxen. Every\r\npair of these horns becomes in time an ants’ nest, and if the tree be\r\ntouched or shaken, the ants rush out full of fury in defence of their\r\nhabitations. Thus every tree is tenanted by a large army of retainers,\r\nwho almost more than the thorns themselves, which have been developed\r\nfor the same purpose, protect it against browsing quadrupeds. Its\r\nthorns, however, would be no protection against the leaf-cutting ants in\r\nsearch of materials for their mushroom-beds, whereas these are kept at\r\nbay by a hostile species, smaller indeed, but armed with a powerful\r\nsting. “For these services,” says Belt, “the ants are not only securely\r\nhoused by the plant, but are provided with a bountiful supply of food;\r\nand to secure their attendance at the right time and place, this food is\r\nso arranged and distributed as to effect that object with wonderful\r\nperfection. The leaves are bi-pinnate (double, that is to say), and at\r\nthe base of each pair of leaflets, on the mid-rib, is a crater-formed\r\ngland, which, when the leaves are young, secretes a honey-like liquid.\r\nOf this the ants are very fond; and they are constantly running about\r\nfrom one gland to another to sip up the honey as it is secreted. But\r\nthis is not all; there is a still more wonderful provision of solid\r\nfood. At the end of each of the small divisions of the compound leaflet\r\nthere is, when the leaf first unfolds, a little yellow, fruit-like body,\r\nunited to it by a point at its base. Examined through a microscope, this\r\nlittle appendage looks like a golden pear. When the leaf first unfolds\r\nthe little pears are not quite ripe, and the ants are continually\r\nemployed going from one to another examining them. When an ant finds one\r\nsufficiently advanced it bites the small point of attachment; then,\r\nbending down the fruit-like body, it breaks it off and bears it away in\r\ntriumph to the nest. All the fruit-like bodies do not ripen at once, but\r\nsuccessively, so that the ants are kept about the young leaf for some\r\ntime after it unfolds. Thus the young leaves are always guarded by the\r\nants; and no caterpillar or larger animal could attempt to injure them\r\nwithout being attacked by the little warriors.” Thus, as Mr. Belt very\r\naptly puts it, “the ants are really kept by the acacia as a standing\r\narmy to protect its leaves from the attacks of herbivorous mammals and\r\ninsects.”[81]\r\n\r\nAs for the honey or honey-pot ants, they were first heard of in America,\r\nand various floating stories, which seemed more or less hard to credit,\r\nhaving got into circulation about them, without there being any positive\r\nknowledge to check them, Dr. McCook, to remove this grave reproach to\r\ntransatlantic entomology, started off one day to observe them. He soon\r\nfound that the main fact which had been stated was correct, viz. that a\r\ncertain sect or caste of these ants, disregarding the Italian warning,\r\nwere in the habit of making themselves all honey, to be swallowed in\r\nconsequence by the rest of the community. These are the so-called\r\nhoney-pots, and so well do they deserve their name, that when full the\r\nabdomen becomes almost perfectly circular, like a glass globe, and so\r\nenormously swollen that the body in proportion to it is like a grain of\r\nwheat stuck into a cherry or gooseberry.[82] The legs dangle towards the\r\nground, but hardly, or only by a great effort, reach it, and in this\r\nlast state of distension the insect may find it impossible to get about,\r\nthough as a rule by dragging or pushing herself along sideways, she is\r\nable to do so to a certain extent. These honey-jars have special\r\nchambers for their accommodation, and here they hang in clusters from\r\nthe roof, awaiting the visit of any worker, who upon signifying his\r\nwants—it would seem after climbing up to them—is fed, after the ordinary\r\nant manner, by regurgitation. In the same way the honey-bearers are\r\nthemselves filled, or more properly speaking, feed themselves, since the\r\nmouth arrangement, in spite of the direction in which things seem\r\nhastening, has not yet become so simple as in the case of a real jar.\r\n\r\nThe honey which the rotunds, as McCook calls them, receive from the\r\nworkers is gathered at night, and is obtained almost entirely from the\r\ngalls of oak trees, which, when pierced by the ant’s mandibles, exude a\r\nwhite transparent liquid in minute globules. This is greedily licked up\r\nby the ants and distributed by them after the return home, not only to\r\nthe rotunds, but to such of their fellow-workers as may not have taken\r\npart in the expedition.[83] The honey thus obtained is pleasant to ant\r\nand human taste alike, and the Indians of New Mexico, as no doubt\r\nelsewhere, obtain it by the simple process of squeezing the\r\ninsect—breaking the honey-jar, as one may say. They also make from it a\r\nfermented liquor having intoxicating powers, so that one need not wonder\r\nthat the idea of farming the honey-ant, like the honey-bee, has been\r\nseriously discussed in the United States. McCook, however, has pointed\r\nout that “the limited quantity of the product would prevent a profitable\r\nindustry,” and he adds: “Besides, the sentiment against the use of honey\r\nthus taken from living insects, which is worthy of all respect, would\r\nnot be overcome.”[83] Personally I think it would be overcome, and\r\npretty quickly, too, as are most other sentiments that stand in the way\r\nof pleasure or profit. Women would get it under first, as in the case of\r\nbirds, seals, etc., and the world would soon follow, with “woman’s\r\ninfluence” upon its lips. But let me not be unjust. I do not believe in\r\nsentiment as a working force in the case at all. If the ants are not to\r\nbe squeezed it will be on commercial considerations.\r\n\r\nThat the worker-ants—and for that matter the others also—are extremely\r\nfond of the honey so curiously stored by them, will be easily believed,\r\nand an unpleasant illustration of their greediness in this respect was\r\noften observed by McCook when capturing a nest. The swollen bodies of\r\nthe rotunds, on these occasions, were sometimes unavoidably ruptured,\r\nwhereupon such workers as happened to be near these unfortunates,\r\nforgetting their alarm, which had hitherto been great, and the ruin and\r\nconfusion all around them, paused in their flight, or aimless movements,\r\nand greedily lapped up the overflowing honey.[84] It is all the more\r\ninteresting, therefore, to learn that when the “little life” of these\r\npoor honey-pots is at length “rounded with a sleep,” their contained\r\ntreasure, though so easily obtainable, goes with them to the grave, the\r\nidea of opening the full crop, and imbibing the contents, never seeming\r\nto occur to any ant. This is all the more remarkable in that the\r\nworkers, when they recognise that life is extinct, carefully separate\r\nthe abdomen from the thorax by sawing through, with their mandibles, the\r\nlittle connecting stalk called the petiole. The two parts are then\r\nremoved separately, that representing the head half being carried,\r\nwhilst the “golden bowl” of the body “unbroken,” though with “the spirit\r\nfled for ever,” is rolled along the various chambers and galleries of\r\nthe nest, till it finally finds a resting-place in the cemetery just\r\nbeyond its precincts.[84] To what are we to attribute the\r\nnon-utilisation of the honey in the dead body? Even were it possible\r\nthat the ants could forget that it was there, they cannot be unconscious\r\nof what must be smelt, as well as seen, through the semi-transparent\r\nwalls of the abdomen. Some feeling must restrain them—what, I am not\r\nprepared to say in a work which does not aim at being scientific.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have one most suggestive illustration—“suggestive,” I\r\nthink, is a very useful word—of the funeral habits of ants. Many others\r\ncould be instanced, but I will end this chapter, and small account of\r\nant doings, generally, with the following extract from the _Proceedings\r\nof the Linnæan Society_ (1861). The observer was a Mrs. Hutton, of\r\nSydney; and Romanes, who quotes her account in his _Animal\r\nIntelligence_, remarks that though she is not a well-known observer the\r\nfacts reported were such as scarcely to admit of a mistake. Personally,\r\nI attach no weight whatever to anybody’s not being known as an observer.\r\nWant of leisure, or unpropitious circumstances generally, must prevent\r\nlarge numbers of people from seeing what they would be very well able to\r\nnote accurately if they did, or from recording what they do see; whilst,\r\non the other hand, leisure, joined to taste in a certain direction,\r\nmakes many a quite average observer known as a good one. A good\r\nobserver, in fact, is rather one who is always keeping on, and does not\r\nweary, than one who can see a single salient thing more plainly than\r\nmost other people; and, again, it is easy to set a fictitious value\r\nmerely on being before the public.\r\n\r\nHaving thus defended Mrs. Hutton, I proceed now to quote her account: “I\r\nsaw,” she says, “a large number of ants surrounding the dead ones”\r\n(soldier ants which she had herself killed and left lying on the ground\r\nsome half-hour previously), “and determined to watch their proceedings\r\nclosely. I followed four or five that started off from the rest towards\r\na hillock a short distance off, in which was an ants’ nest. This they\r\nentered, and in about five minutes they reappeared, followed by others.\r\nAll fell into rank, walking regularly and slowly, two by two, until they\r\narrived at the spot where lay the dead bodies of the soldier ants. In a\r\nfew minutes two of the ants advanced and took up the dead body of one of\r\ntheir comrades; then two others, and so on, until all were ready to\r\nmarch. First walked two ants bearing a body, then two without a burden;\r\nthen two others with another dead ant, and so on, until the line was\r\nextended to about forty pairs, and the procession now moved slowly\r\nonwards, followed by an irregular body of about two hundred ants.\r\nOccasionally the two laden ants stopped, and laying down the dead one,\r\nit was taken up by the two walking unburdened behind them, and thus, by\r\noccasionally relieving each other, they arrived at a sandy spot near the\r\nsea. The body of ants now commenced digging with their jaws a number of\r\nholes in the ground, into each of which a dead ant was laid, where they\r\nnow laboured on until they had filled up the graves. This did not quite\r\nfinish the remarkable circumstances attending this funeral of the ants.\r\nSome six or seven individuals had attempted to run off without\r\nperforming their share of the task of digging; these were caught and\r\nbrought back, when they were at once attacked by the body of ants and\r\nkilled upon the spot. A single grave was quickly dug, and they were all\r\ndropped into it.”\r\n\r\n“Prodigious!” as Dominie Sampson would have said, and certainly I think\r\nthis is one of the most remarkable observations upon ants that has ever\r\nbeen made. As far as the burying is concerned, it has been corroborated\r\nby the Rev. W. Farrar White, who, at the same time, corroborates Pliny;\r\nbut how strange are all the circumstances! What was it, one wonders,\r\nthat made just a few of the crowd shirk their share of the labour—for\r\nthis is not like ants. Some strange, uncanny feeling in connection with\r\nthe dead bodies may be suspected; but seeing that, as the Russian\r\nproverb truly says, “Another man’s soul is darkness,” it is not very\r\nlikely that we shall ever know what ants feel.\r\n\r\nOne interesting question is suggested in this connection, though I have\r\nnever known it raised yet. Two views of what ants are, excluding\r\ncompromises, may be taken—the automatic one, tempered with “psychic\r\nplasticity,” of Professor Wheeler, and that formed by Mr. Belt, who,\r\nhaving fully satisfied himself—from the keenest observation, be it\r\nremembered—of their reasoning powers and capacities, remarks, “When we\r\nsee these intelligent insects dwelling together in orderly communities\r\nof many thousands of individuals, their social instincts developed to a\r\nhigh degree of perfection, making their marches with the regularity of\r\ndisciplined troops, showing ingenuity in the crossing of difficult\r\nplaces, assisting each other in danger, defending their nests at the\r\nrisk of their own lives, communicating information rapidly to a great\r\ndistance, making a regular division of work, the whole community taking\r\ncharge of the rearing of the young, and all imbued with the strongest\r\nsense of industry, each individual labouring not for itself alone, but\r\nfor all its fellows, we may imagine that Sir Thomas More’s description\r\nof Utopia might have been applied with greater justice to such a\r\ncommunity than to any human society.”[85] Now, if Belt’s view be the\r\ncorrect one, or if the evidence in favour of it be at all strong, is it\r\nnot time for us to ask ourselves, merely as a moral problem, how far we,\r\nin our clumsy and imperfect human state, have a right to kill ants and\r\ntumble Utopia to pieces, simply for our amusement, intellectual or\r\notherwise? Ought we to do this? Or ought we, like a lady who lives in\r\nAmerica and writes to very scientific papers, to imprison queens who do\r\nno harm, and make ourselves learned at the expense of one, or both of\r\ntheir antennæ, during the term of their natural lives? However simply\r\nand sweetly we may talk of this, however much true womanly feeling may\r\nenter into the narrative, nay, even though we give the queens pet names,\r\nis it really right?\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 74:\r\n\r\n  Romanes, Animal Intelligence, pp. 106-107.\r\n\r\nFootnote 75:\r\n\r\n  The American Naturalist, February, 1902.\r\n\r\nFootnote 76:\r\n\r\n  The Cambridge Natural History, vol. 6.\r\n\r\nFootnote 77:\r\n\r\n  Du Chaillu, Adventures in Equatorial Africa, pp. 312, 313.\r\n\r\nFootnote 78:\r\n\r\n  J.

Wasps are less written about, but even here, in a work\r\nwhich can only deal with a very few insects out of a very great many, a\r\nchoice may be permitted one, so I will merely observe, in regard to the\r\ncommon species, that in my opinion wasps are much less irascible than\r\nbees—in fact, quite good-natured compared to them—but at the same time,\r\nowing to their room-entering, table-pillaging propensities, much greater\r\nnuisances, so that they deserve stern treatment, but a more charitable\r\nestimate of their character. Hornets, again—which seldom offend in this\r\nway—appear to me to be very peaceable insects, as though, wielding a\r\nmighty weapon, they felt that they had no need to use it except on “a\r\nstriking emergency.” Such a definition would apply to the running of a\r\nstage-coach, diligence, omnibus, waggon, etc.—in fact, any large\r\nvehicle—into their nest on the highway, in which case the consequences,\r\none may well believe, would be appalling. Never having been in such a\r\nposition myself, and being without trustworthy information on the\r\nsubject, my powers of description are useless here, but there is a way\r\nof dealing with this emergency also. This reminds me, however, of an\r\naccount which I have read somewhere or other of hornets having once\r\nstopped a Roman army. This may seem surprising nowadays, but we must\r\nremember that in classical times armies did not possess artillery. There\r\nis therefore nothing invidious in the opinion which I here express, that\r\nhowever much they may have stopped the Romans, they would never stop the\r\nJapanese.\r\n\r\nIn both ants and bees we find solitary and social species, so as in ants\r\nwe have been considering the latter only, we will now reverse the\r\nprocess with bees. There are many interesting species of solitary bees,\r\nbut it must be premised that the word “solitary” is to be understood\r\nhere in a special rather than in a general sense. As far as mere numbers\r\nare concerned, there is often a large community of bees building their\r\ncells in close proximity all at the same time, but each builds its cell\r\nfor itself alone, or rather for its family—no one thinks of helping its\r\nneighbour. There is no co-operation, in fact, and that makes all the\r\ndifference. It would be all the same to every one of the bees that are\r\nbuilding so close together if all the rest went away and left it to work\r\nalone. And yet we cannot even quite say this, because, in one case, at\r\nany rate, though every individual bee makes its own cell and thinks only\r\nof that and of its own family, yet, when all the cells are finished, the\r\nwhole community join in making one mud roof over the whole of them. By\r\nthis we see how difficult it is to find quite separate places for allied\r\nanimals, and how the habits of one are apt to slide gradually into those\r\nof another. Still, we must do the best we can, and take words as we find\r\nthem, remembering that the locusts, as already explained, do _not_\r\nbelong to the _locustidæ_.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRIVEN OUT BY HORNETS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    Aelian, in his “Natural History,” says that a city in Crete\r\n      was attacked by such a plague of hornets that the\r\n      inhabitants were driven to abandon it, and build a new city\r\n      on another site. A hornet is shown to the right of this\r\n      inscription.\r\n\r\nAmongst the best known of the solitary species of bees are the Carpenter\r\nBees, the Carding and Tapestry Bees, and the Mason Bees. Of the latter a\r\ngreat French observer, who, though he lives now, belongs really to the\r\ndays of Réaumur and Swammerdam, has something to tell us. Speaking not\r\nof Réaumur’s maison bee—that “splendid Hymenopteron with its dark violet\r\nwings and costume of black velvet”[86]—but of a smaller\r\nspecies—_Chalicodoma sicula_—he says: “You should see the active bee at\r\nwork when the road is dazzling white in the hot sunshine. Between the\r\nneighbouring farm where she is building and the road where the mortar is\r\nprepared there is a deep hum of the bees perpetually crossing each other\r\nas they come and go. The air seems traversed by constant trails of\r\nsmoke, so rapid and direct is their flight. Those who go carry away a\r\npellet of mortar as big as small shot: those who come settle on the\r\nhardest and driest spots. Their whole body vibrates as they scratch with\r\nthe tips of their mandibles and rake with their forefeet to extract\r\natoms of earth and grains of sand, which, being rolled between their\r\nteeth, become moist with saliva, and unite. They work with such ardour\r\nthat they will let themselves be crushed under the foot of a passer-by\r\nrather than move.”[86] Then comes the making of the actual nest, or\r\nlittle collection of cells. “After choosing a boulder,” says Fabre, “she\r\ncomes with a pellet of mortar in her mandibles, and arranges it in a\r\nring on the surface of the pebble. The forefeet, and, above all, the\r\nmandibles, which are her most important tools, work the material, which\r\nis kept plastic by the gradually disgorged saliva. To consolidate the\r\nunbaked clay, angular pieces of gravel as large as a small bean are\r\nworked in singly on the outside of the still soft mass. This is the\r\nfoundation of the edifice. Other layers are added, until the cell has\r\nthe required height of three or four centimetres. The masonry is formed\r\nby stones laid on one another and cemented with lime, and can stand\r\ncomparison with our own. Layers of mortar sparingly used hold them\r\ntogether. The cell completed, the bee sets to work at once to store it.\r\nThe neighbouring flowers, especially those of _Genista scorpius_, which\r\nin May turn the alluviums of the torrents golden, furnish sugared\r\nliquids and pollen. She comes with her crop swelled with honey, and all\r\nyellow underneath with pollen dust, and plunges head first into the\r\ncell, where for some moments one may see her work her body in a way\r\nwhich tells that she is disgorging honey. Her crop emptied, she comes\r\nout, but only to go in again at once, this time backwards. With her two\r\nhind feet she now frees herself from her load of pollen by brushing\r\nherself underneath. Again she goes out, and returns head first. She must\r\nstir the materials with her mandibles for a spoon, and mix all\r\nthoroughly together. When the cell is half full it is stored; an egg\r\nmust be laid on the honey paste, and the door has to be closed. This is\r\nall done without delay. The orifice is closed by a cover of undiluted\r\nmortar, worked from the circumference to the centre. Two days, at most,\r\nseem required for the whole work.”[86] Afterwards several more\r\ncells—making a continuous group of from six to ten—are added, and when\r\nall is completed, the mason bee “builds a thick cover over the whole\r\ngroup, which, being of a material impermeable to water, and almost a\r\nnon-conductor, is at once a defence against heat and cold and damp. This\r\nmaterial is the usual mortar, made of earth and saliva, only with no\r\nsmall stones in it. The nest is now a rude dome, about as big as half an\r\norange; one would take it for a clod of mud flung against a stone, where\r\nit had dried. Nothing outside betrays its contents—no suggestion of\r\ncells, none of labour. To the ordinary eye it is only a chance splash of\r\nmud.”\r\n\r\nOf course, when the eggs are hatched, the bee larvæ feed on the stored\r\npollen and honey, a pleasing picture which suggests another something\r\nlike it, though not altogether the same. I allude to certain species of\r\nsolitary wasps, which, urged by the same feelings of maternal\r\nsolicitude, choose a living caterpillar, grasshopper, spider, etc., for\r\nthe future sustenance of their young. Take, for instance, _Ammophila\r\nurnaria_ of North America, whose habits in this respect have been\r\ncarefully studied. This wasp is about an inch long, with very long legs,\r\nand a waist even exaggeratedly wasp-like. It is black in colour, but\r\nwith a red mark running round the fore part of the abdomen. At the\r\nproper time she—for, of course, we are dealing with the female—may be\r\nseen running about the ground, and eagerly searching the various plants\r\nand grasses that come in her way. Occasionally, as though in lightness\r\nboth of heart and body, she gives a leap off the ground, and at other\r\ntimes will fly up from it more deliberately, to make an examination of\r\nsome overhanging leaf. At last, as a result of these little aerial\r\nexcursions, let us say, she knocks down a certain green caterpillar of\r\nthe kind wanted, and with maternal devotion full upon her, at once sets\r\nto work. The caterpillar, however, though taken by surprise, and\r\nassaulted the instant it has touched the ground, resists strenuously, as\r\nthough instinctively knowing, and highly disapproving of, the fate in\r\nstore for it. It is larger and more bulky than the wasp, and its\r\ncontortions are so powerful that the latter is several times repulsed in\r\nher assaults. She is not discouraged, however, but continues\r\nperseveringly to fly at the caterpillar, till at last she takes it at a\r\ndisadvantage, possibly in a moment of weariness, and alighting with her\r\nlong legs on each side of the large, soft body, seizes it by the neck\r\nwith her mandibles, and holds it fast. Now the caterpillar, stimulated\r\ndoubtless by the painful, or at least unwelcome nip, struggles with\r\nredoubled energy; but it is beneath its oppressor, who, straddling over\r\nit and never relaxing her grasp, lifts it at last, with an effort, a\r\nlittle from the ground, and inserting her curved abdomen like a fish\r\nhook beneath it, strikes in a more effective and certain way than did\r\never the most benevolently contemplative member of all the fishing\r\nfraternity. The result is instantly apparent, for with the entry of that\r\ndeadly sting into its body, all struggles on the part of the caterpillar\r\ncease, and it lies a living corpse at the feet of its cruel oppressor.\r\nThe latter, after remaining still for some moments as though to give her\r\nvictim time to realise and appreciate its situation, stings it again and\r\nthen again, each time choosing, as she has done before, for the locality\r\nof the operation, the junction of two out of the dozen or so segments\r\ninto which the long length of the caterpillar is divided. Then she flies\r\nup, but after circling a little above the scene of her triumph, she\r\ndescends again, and gives her victim, though now helpless and paralysed,\r\na taste or two more of her quality. The first part of her business is\r\nnow done, and well done. She has earned a rest, or rather she may\r\nexchange one form of activity for another. Accordingly she proceeds to\r\nindulge in the pleasures of the toilette, and it is not till this is\r\ncompletely finished that she flies with, or drags, her victim to the\r\nneat little burial-place, representing also her future nursery, which\r\nshe has already provided for it.[87]\r\n\r\nThe above illustration is taken from the account of a particular case\r\nwhich fell under the keen observation of G. W. and E. G. Peckham, two\r\nwell-known American entomologists. On other occasions, however, this\r\nwasp—that is to say, various individuals of the same species—besides\r\nstinging the caterpillar, went through another and more curious process.\r\nThis consisted in biting and squeezing the anterior upper portion—the\r\nneck as we may call it—of their victim.[87] The same operation was also\r\nobserved by Fabre when he watched his good mothers, but though I have\r\ncalled it biting and squeezing, that is not the right term for a\r\n_savant_ to employ. _He_ calls it malaxation, which, perhaps, means\r\ndoing both at the same time. Biting, however, would seem to imply no\r\nless, but, perhaps in order to bite scientifically, it is necessary to\r\ntake a piece out, or at least to make the blood come, though in common\r\nparlance this does not, or did not, hold good, since Sampson bit his\r\nthumb at Abram and Balthasar, in the first scene of _Romeo and Juliet_,\r\nbut it cannot be supposed—nor does the context support such a view—that\r\nhe bit it so hard as that. Malaxation, however, let it be; but why such\r\na process on the part of the wasp should be necessary it is not easy to\r\nsee, since the mandibles are not poisonous like the sting, and the\r\nlatter is all in all sufficient to produce the paralysis required, as is\r\napparent in the instance already given, where the sting alone was\r\nemployed. To me it seems possible that this malaxation may be a\r\nhappiness to the wasp merely, as the shaking of a rat certainly is to a\r\nterrier, whatever other advantages accrue from it. That insects, like\r\nother animals, including man—who, indeed, is the crowning instance—take\r\na savage pleasure in overpowering and killing their prey, I have myself\r\nvery little doubt.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that this wasp stung the caterpillar between the segments\r\nof its body, and, as we will assume—for the result seems to warrant the\r\ninference—in the central part of it, so that the sting, entering the\r\ngreat nervous cord or ganglion, which is situated in this region, with\r\nlittle swellings at each of the segmental rings, produced the described\r\nparalysis. It was Fabre’s view that this must always be the case, and he\r\nthought likewise, in accordance with his own observation, that the\r\ncaterpillar received a sting at the junction of all or nearly all the\r\nsegments of its body. Otherwise it would be imperfectly stung, and in\r\nconsequence not sufficiently paralysed to prevent its struggling, and so\r\ndetaching the young larva, or perhaps the egg, which, as it would seem,\r\nis laid on, and not inside, the body of its living provisions. On the\r\nother hand, were the caterpillar stung too severely, so as to be killed\r\noutright, the grub when hatched would only have putrid meat to feed\r\nupon, and this again, it was assumed, would be fatal to its existence.\r\nOn these grounds Fabre concluded that we had here an instinct which must\r\nhave been perfect from the beginning, since as anything short of such\r\nperfection would be followed by the death of the larva, those gradual\r\nsteps by which, on the theory of natural selection, all excellence\r\neither of structure or instinct has been attained, could not in a case\r\nlike this have had any existence.\r\n\r\nBut all this has been exploded by subsequent observation. What Fabre saw\r\nhe knew, but in all that he inferred without seeing he was entirely\r\nmistaken. As observed by the Peckhams, a caterpillar may be either stung\r\nso slightly as to be quite lively, and yet not succeed in shaking off\r\nthe wasp larva hatched on its body, or so severely as to die almost\r\nimmediately, yet without detriment to the larva who feeds on its\r\ndiscoloured and more or less putrified body, with the same gusto, and\r\napparent benefit, as though it were warm with life.[87] Thus the\r\nquestion seems not so much to be, how can such perfection of instinct as\r\nwas observed by Fabre have been attained through the process of natural\r\nselection, as why it should have been attained; or perhaps we may even\r\ngo further and ask if this supposed perfection exists at all, and\r\nwhether Fabre did not deceive himself. A wasp having secured a\r\ncaterpillar is, of course, at liberty to sting it as often as it\r\npleases. Why, then, should one wasp behave quite like another one in\r\nthis respect? Here, as elsewhere, there would be some amount—perhaps a\r\nconsiderable amount—of variation in individual disposition, and wasps of\r\nmilder or less savage mood would sting less frequently than their\r\nfiercer fellows. There might, therefore, as it appears to me, be a large\r\namount of fluctuation both in the number and degree of severity of the\r\nstings—if indeed there is any regulation in this respect—and also in the\r\nconsequent injury to the caterpillar or other insect, without any\r\nparticular scope being offered for natural selection to play a part.\r\nWhat room, indeed, for such a force can there be if it makes no\r\ndifference to the wasp-grub whether the caterpillar which is to be its\r\nfood, is stung badly or slightly, or whether it lives or dies?\r\n\r\nThat this is really the case seems to be implied in the following\r\nparagraph which I quote from the same interesting work that I have\r\nbefore referred to[87] “The conclusions that we draw from the study of\r\nthis genus differ in the most striking manner from those of Fabre. The\r\none pre-eminent, unmistakable, and ever-present fact” (the invariable\r\nfact, as one might say) “is variability. Variability in every\r\nparticular—in the shape of the nest and the manner of digging it, in the\r\ncondition of the nest (whether closed or open) when left temporarily, in\r\nthe method of stinging the prey, in the degree of malaxation, in the\r\nmanner of carrying the victim, in the way of closing the nest, and last\r\nand most important of all, in the condition produced in the victims of\r\nthe stinging, some of them dying and becoming ‘veritable cadavers,’ to\r\nuse an expressive term of Fabre’s, long before the larva is ready to\r\nbegin on them, while others live long past the time at which they would\r\nhave been attacked and destroyed if we had not interfered with the\r\nnatural course of events. And all this variability we get from the study\r\nof nine wasps and fifteen caterpillars”![87] Fabre’s ideas therefore\r\nseem totally disproved, but though natural selection—the counter-theory\r\nto his own—has no doubt produced the _Sphex_ and _Ammophila_, with their\r\nhabit of stinging and storing caterpillars, to serve as food for their\r\nyoung, it does not follow that it has done anything more than this; for\r\nthough variation be the stuff in which natural selection works, it need\r\nnot always work in it—any more than a tailor need always make clothes\r\nbecause there is an abundance of cloth.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOLITARY WASPS]\r\n\r\n    In the upper part of the picture a solitary wasp is seen\r\n      attacking a caterpillar on a leaf. Beneath is another of the\r\n      same species busy pounding the entrance to its burrow with a\r\n      pebble.\r\n\r\nIn the digging and closing of her burrow—her nesting-habits, as we may\r\ncall them—our _Ammophila_ is almost as interesting to watch as in her\r\nmode of proceeding with caterpillars, though here a certain well-known\r\nstimulus to human enjoyment which I need not enlarge upon is wanting.\r\nHaving found a convenient spot for her nursery, she digs, with her\r\nmandibles and front pair of legs, a little tunnel in the ground, to\r\nabout the length of her own body, and at the end of it hollows out a\r\nround chamber or cavern just large enough to make comfortable quarters\r\nfor a pair of invalid caterpillars—a hospital for incurables, we may\r\ncall it to begin with, but soon to become their tomb. Having dug to\r\nabout her middle, the wasp backs out, with a little pellet of collected\r\nearth held firmly in her mandibles. With this she flies to a little\r\ndistance and then, letting it drop, alights on the ground and takes a\r\nlittle rest before returning to continue her work. She may either fly or\r\nrun back, for her legs are as highly developed as her wings—she is in\r\nfact a very perfect athlete. The process of excavation is now continued,\r\nthere is more burrowing, more flying away with the earth dug out, and\r\nbefore long the nursery-vault is completed. The next thing is to find\r\ncaterpillars for it, but before flying away to look for one, _Ammophila_\r\ncarefully conceals the entrance to her tunnel with pellets of earth,\r\nwhich she often brings from a distance, and will not be satisfied with\r\nunless they seem well adapted for their purpose. At last, when the\r\naperture is both blocked and hidden, she starts off upon the still more\r\nimportant undertaking which has been already described, and after a\r\nlonger or shorter interval—if her quest is successful—returns with a\r\nnicely stung caterpillar. As two are required there must be another\r\njourney and another stopping up of the burrow, before the final one,\r\nwhich is of a more solid nature, occupying, sometimes, as much as twenty\r\nminutes. In thus bringing her labours to a conclusion, _Ammophila_ often\r\nshows a wonderful degree of intelligent foresight—foresight we must term\r\nit if we admit the intelligence; for sometimes she will drag a leaf over\r\nthe entrance to the tunnel, though now filled in, or taking a stone as\r\nlarge as her head in her mandibles, will pound down the earth with it to\r\nmake it firm and compact.[87]\r\n\r\nIt used to be said—and may be still by that large class of people who\r\nare for ever making false parallels and artificial distinctions—that man\r\nwas the only animal that made intelligent use of an instrument, but\r\nDarwin instanced a monkey cracking a nut with a stone, and an elephant\r\nbreaking off a bough to fan itself with. Here, in an insect, we have a\r\ncase which is perhaps even more to the point—more extraordinary, that is\r\nto say; for certainly the idea of flattening and pressing down earth\r\nover a general surface, and of taking something to do it with, seems a\r\nlittle less obvious than that of cracking a nut, in a similar manner,\r\nand therefore to require more thought in the planner of such a process.\r\nNo wonder that the delighted witnesses of this interesting fact flung\r\nthemselves on the ground on each side of the unconscious inspirer of\r\ntheir wonder, in order to have a better sight of it; but that a previous\r\nobserver of the same thing should have waited a year before publishing\r\nwhat he had seen, because he feared such a statement would not be\r\nbelieved,[87] is to my mind a display of prudence almost as wonderful,\r\nthough not nearly so edifying, as that of _Ammophila_ herself. If we are\r\nnot to make known what we see, because people who believe in their own\r\nand nobody else’s eyesight are not likely to credit it, how is evidence\r\nto accumulate for the benefit of the more intelligent part of the\r\ncommunity? It is only of this small minority that we should think, or,\r\nrather, we should not think of anything but the truth, where truth is\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nReturning to bees of the solitary kind, “the operations of the\r\nwood-piercers,” says Bingley, “merit our careful attention.” They shall\r\nhave it for a moment, but space is against them. However, the female of\r\nthe species, _Xylocopa violacea_, which for some reason is disliked by\r\nhouseholders, bores in the springtime, by the aid of her strong\r\nmandibles alone, neat little circular tunnels in such objects as\r\ngarden-seats, gates, front doors, arbours, window-shutters, rustic\r\ntables, and the like. At first, it is stated, she “bores\r\nperpendicularly, but when she has advanced about half an inch she\r\nchanges her direction, and then proceeds nearly parallel with its sides\r\nfor twelve or fifteen inches. If the wood of the seat, door, table,\r\netc., be sufficiently thick, she sometimes forms three or four of these\r\nlong holes in its interior, a labour which for a single insect seems\r\nprodigious, and in the execution of it some weeks are sometimes\r\nemployed. On the ground, for about a foot from the place in which one of\r\nthese bees is working, little heaps of timber-dust are to be seen. These\r\nheaps daily increase in size, and the particles that compose them are\r\nalmost as large as those produced by a hand-saw.”[88] When the tunnels\r\nare finished, the mother bee divides them into some dozen little rooms\r\nabout an inch deep, making the divisions of wood-dust, which she cements\r\ntogether by aid of a glutinous secretion with which she is furnished.\r\nBefore each cell is closed it is filled with a paste composed of the\r\nfarina of flowers, mixed with honey (it makes one envy the grub), and an\r\negg is deposited in it. As each cell takes some time to make and\r\nprovision, it is obvious that the egg in the lower one will hatch a\r\nlittle sooner than the one above it, and so on right up to the top. If,\r\ntherefore, any one of the larvæ “were to force its way upwards, which it\r\ncould easily do, it would not only disturb, but would infallibly destroy\r\nall those lodged in the superior cells.”[88] Here, however, natural\r\nselection (called Providence in Bingley’s time) steps in, and “has\r\nwisely prevented this devastation, for the head of the nymph\r\n(chrysalis), and consequently of the emerging bee, is always placed in a\r\ndownward direction.”[88] Of course, therefore, the insect moves forward\r\nin the direction towards which it looks at birth—its new birth, that is\r\nto say; and, moreover—this is the really astonishing thing—“the mother\r\ndigs a hole at the bottom of the long tube, which makes a communication\r\nbetween the undermost cell and the open air. By this contrivance, as all\r\nthe bees instinctively endeavour to cut their way downward, they find an\r\neasy and convenient passage, for they have only to pierce the floor of\r\ntheir cells in order to make their escape, and this they do with their\r\nteeth very readily.” As regards this communicating passage, however, it\r\nis presumably a mere continuation of the tunnel, and was probably once\r\noccupied with cells, like the upper portion. Why the lower end of the\r\ntunnel should have come in time to be left empty—what advantage, that is\r\nto say, its being so represents—it is not easy to see, but possibly it\r\nstood in danger of being reached by a bird’s beak, through what has now\r\nbecome the exit of escape merely.\r\n\r\nAs there is a leaf-cutting ant, so, too, there is a leaf-cutting bee,\r\nbut here the resemblance ends, since no thought of food or fungus enters\r\nthe mind of the latter insect. Her more simple and direct object is to\r\nmake the severed leaves into cells, and this she does with wonderful\r\nskill and ingenuity. The cells, which are made by rolling the pieces of\r\nleaves round within a tunnel or gallery, previously excavated in the\r\nearth, are separated from one another by a circular piece, which fits\r\ninto the tube with extreme nicety, making at once the ceiling of each\r\nlower compartment and the floor of that above it. As each is finished\r\nthe bee, as in the other instances, fills it with a mixture of honey and\r\npollen, upon which she then lays an egg, and finally closes the mouth of\r\nthe tunnel. The leaf principally used for the manufacture of these\r\npretty cradles is the rose leaf, and the paste which fills them is of a\r\nrose-red colour, owing to the pollen having been collected for the most\r\npart from thistles.\r\n\r\nThe children of the leaf-cutting bee, therefore, are delicately housed,\r\nbut what are they, in this respect, to those of the poppy or tapestry\r\nbee, who are born like the Byzantine princes in a “purple[89] chamber”\r\nmade of the rich leaves of poppies? Here they lie, or crawl, in state,\r\none to each royal apartment, which is filled, almost to the brim, with\r\nthe sweet food of bees. Yet when they come forth, at last, it is not as\r\ngorgeous imperial creatures clothed in “purple and pall,” but only\r\nlittle ordinary-looking black bees covered all over with dirty grey\r\nhair. And their beautiful purple poppy chamber has been seen by no\r\none—not even by themselves probably—buried as it is full three inches\r\ndeep in the earth. Wallace, somewhere in his _Malay Archipelago_,\r\nmoralises over the beautiful little kingbird of paradise, sparkling out\r\nits life amidst the forest solitudes of a remote island, unseen by human\r\neyes, save those of savages, till once or twice, perhaps, in a century,\r\nsome wandering white man, who alone is capable of appreciating its\r\nbeauty, comes to bang its life out and bear away its skin. The thought\r\nof this dainty little crimson-tapestried bower lying in black darkness,\r\nlike a grave beneath one’s feet, rouses a similar train of reflection in\r\nthe mind, but perhaps it would do so more strongly were it associated in\r\nthe same degree with ideas of sport or profitable collecting.\r\n\r\nThe carding-bee is interesting, not so much for the nest which it makes,\r\nas for the wonderful way in which it makes it—or, to express it more\r\njustly, it is more especially interesting on this account. Having either\r\nmade or found a suitable cavity, these bees under-roof it with a thick\r\nthatching of moss. To carry this, bit by bit, to the place, would take\r\nthem a very long time, so, instead of doing so, they stand one behind\r\nanother, with their backs toward the nest, in a line that reaches from\r\nthe moss to its entrance. The furthest bee then pulls out a piece with\r\nher mandibles, cards it with her fore feet, and, with the others, passes\r\nit on, beneath her body, to the second bee, who passes it to the third,\r\nthe third to the fourth, and so on, all down the line, the last bee\r\nentering the nest with it. Thus these bees do with moss exactly what\r\nrats have been seen to do with eggs, when transporting them to their\r\nburrows. A most interesting anecdote of this is quoted by Romanes,[90]\r\nfrom Jesse’s _Gleanings_, but it does not appear to be in my edition,\r\nwhich I had thought was a complete one. All I can find is a bare\r\nreference to their having been known to “convey” eggs from a box, in\r\nthis way—“convey the wise it call.” This is an annoying discovery, for I\r\ndetest all selections, not made by myself, from Palgrave’s _Golden\r\nTreasury_ to any man’s “Hundred Rest Books.” But if my edition _is_ a\r\ncomplete one, then the thing should be looked into, for the anecdote\r\nquoted by Romanes is not there—at least it is untraceable through the\r\nindex.\r\n\r\nLike ants, bees are subject to parasites, and as some belonging to the\r\nformer are ants themselves, so with bees we have the same thing, but\r\ndeveloped to a still more striking extent; for there is no ant that I\r\nknow of that lives with another which it so closely resembles that the\r\nlatter is unable to distinguish it from itself. Such bees, however,\r\nthere are. Some of our humble bees, for instance, go through life thus\r\nattended by a double whose existence it never for one moment suspects.\r\nThe two, indeed, are linked in the closest bonds of social intimacy.\r\nTogether they leave the nest, together they fly from flower to flower,\r\ntogether they re-enter it. Together, too, they seem to glow in\r\nindustry—to emulate each other’s toil. But all the while that the true\r\nindustrious bee is collecting pollen and nectar the double is only\r\npretending to do so—or rather, let us say, seeming—and whilst the former\r\nbustles about, feeding the larvæ and making the cells, the latter only\r\nbustles about, like the shadow of a busy person on the wall. But when\r\nthe true bee lays an egg, the double lays one too, almost at the same\r\nmoment, and in the very same cell. Both are then hatched, together, and\r\nthe two larvæ grow up in the same cradle, nourished by the same food,\r\nmake their transformation side by side, and so creep forth into the\r\nnest. The two, as I say, are hardly to be distinguished one from\r\nanother, yet all the while one is a real true-hearted humble bee, and\r\nthe other a mere show, a stage make-up, an outer shell without any of\r\nthe proper qualities inside. And the best of the joke is, that,\r\nprobably, the false or cuckoo bee, as it is called, is as much deceived\r\nas its foster relatives, and imagines itself a good honest sterling\r\nmember of the community. It is forced by nature to cheat, but the fraud\r\nis unconscious, and the impostor is imposed on in its turn.\r\n\r\nThus in the insect world we have something which can only be brought\r\nabout, amongst ourselves, through a conscious disguise, by means of\r\nwigs, false moustaches, etc.—what we call an impersonation—but here is a\r\nlife-long impersonation which costs the “born actor” no trouble. Why is\r\nthis? What is the meaning of it? Why should one bee—or any other insect\r\nor creature—look just like another one, and yet have a Latin name of its\r\nown, which the other has no right to? Why should the individuals of one\r\nspecies be hardly more like each other than they are like the\r\nindividuals of another species, even though—as is often the case—these\r\ntwo species are widely separated in the system of nature? Such are the\r\nquestions to which a consideration of these cuckoo-bees, as they are\r\ncalled, give rise. They will be answered, if at all, in the following\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 86:\r\n\r\n  Fabre, Insect Life, pp. 275-283.\r\n\r\nFootnote 87:\r\n\r\n  Peckham, The Instincts and Habits of the Solitary Wasps.\r\n\r\nFootnote 88:\r\n\r\n  Bingley, Animal Biography.\r\n\r\nFootnote 89:\r\n\r\n  The real purple of the ancients was a rich red—crimson or vermilion.\r\n\r\nFootnote 90:\r\n\r\n  Romanes, Animal Intelligence, pp. 361, 362.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\n    Natural selection—Protective resemblances—A locust’s\r\n      stratagem—Mock leaf-cutting ants—Flowery dissemblers—A Malay\r\n      explanation—Snake-suggesting caterpillars—A prudent\r\n      lizard—Inconclusive experiments—A bogus ant—Flies that live\r\n      with bees—A caterpillar that dresses up—A portrait-modelling\r\n      caterpillar.\r\n\r\nEVERYBODY knows nowadays how all the different species of animals and\r\nplants, living and extinct, have come into existence. It was quite\r\nsimple. All they had to do was to keep on varying. Some of them varied\r\nin a way that was good for them, some in a way that was bad. The latter\r\ndied, but the others increased and multiplied, and as the process was\r\nalways going on, and it is impossible to vary long without becoming\r\nchanged, it happened that creatures which had started with a certain\r\nappearance got in time to have quite another one, so that they would not\r\nhave been recognised by the people who used to know them, if these same\r\npeople had kept alive. However, as the process was so slow that it took\r\nmillions of years, and is still going on, awkward things of this sort\r\nnever happened, and so, as nobody had ever seen one species of animal\r\nchange into another before their eyes, they found it difficult to\r\nbelieve that they ever had done so; for the ordinary person says\r\n“seeing’s believing,” though he believes in all sorts of things that\r\nneither he nor anyone else ever has seen, or is ever likely to. Still,\r\nfor all that, he thinks his own eyesight must be better than anyone\r\nelse’s.\r\n\r\nThis process of eternal change, with the changes for the better\r\nsurviving, and those for the worse dying out, is what is called natural\r\nselection, and if we understand it—as there are few now who do not—we\r\ncan understand this, that if any kind of creature is so strong and\r\nformidable that it would be an advantage for weaker creatures to be\r\nmistaken for it, then it is not at all unlikely that some of these\r\nweaker creatures will get more and more to resemble it, until at last\r\nthey are so mistaken. For instance, our common wasps, who are armed with\r\na formidable sting, and are very skilful in using it, are not attacked\r\nby any other insect, excepting hornets, which are not common. Any fly or\r\nmoth, therefore, that resembles a wasp will be generally left alone, and\r\nthe more so the more it resembles it. Accordingly we do find flies and\r\nmoths that look very like wasps, and live safely in consequence. Still\r\nmore would it be of advantage to look like a hornet, and there is a moth\r\nso like one that it is called the Hornet-clear-wing.\r\n\r\nOn this same principle of being mistaken for something that is safe from\r\nattack or annoyance, all sorts of animals, and in a special degree\r\ninsects, have come to look like various objects around them, and amidst\r\nwhich they live, such as stems of grass, pieces of moss or stick,\r\nleaves, flowers, and so on—some of the resemblances being more special\r\nand extraordinary. These are things which, though the eye may see, it\r\ndoes not as a rule dwell upon, because there are so many others round\r\nabout. Who, for instance, would look at any particular blade of grass?\r\nSo a bird that would pounce down upon an insect that it saw moving\r\namongst the leaves of a tree, if there was no doubt that it was an\r\ninsect, would not take any pains to examine what only looked like one\r\nleaf amongst many.\r\n\r\nThus, throughout nature we have these curious resemblances of certain\r\ncreatures to certain other creatures, or to the plants or inanimate\r\nobjects around them, but it is principally amongst insects that the\r\nphenomenon is met with, probably because they increase and multiply so\r\nquickly that there has been more time both for the laws of inheritance\r\nand for the great controlling one of natural selection to have come into\r\nplay. Whatever is the reason, there is no doubt about the fact, which\r\nwill be best illustrated by one or two salient instances.\r\n\r\nAnts, though they fall a prey to various animals larger than\r\nthemselves—such as birds or ant-eaters—yet in their relations with other\r\ninsects occupy a position of comparative safety, on account of their\r\nweapons and pugnacity, and, still more, of their numbers. The driver\r\nants of equatorial Africa, and their South American representatives, the\r\n_ecitons_, are indeed, when they set out on their foraging expeditions,\r\nthe terror, not only of insects, but of all animal life. “Wherever they\r\nmove,” says Bates, referring to the latter, “the whole animal world is\r\nset in commotion, and every creature tries to get out of their way.”[91]\r\nThis, however, as they climb trees, and send out encircling columns\r\nwhich enclose a considerable extent of ground, is difficult, or rather,\r\nimpossible, for all such as cannot fly some distance without alighting;\r\nfor if an ant or two once seize upon them all is over. An insect,\r\ntherefore, that cannot evade the onset of such an enemy is lucky if it\r\nhas some such means of ensuring its safety as has been above referred\r\nto. One at least thus specially favoured inhabits Nicaragua. “I was much\r\nsurprised,” says Mr. Belt, “with the behaviour of a green leaf-like\r\nlocust. This insect stood immovably amongst a host of ants, many of\r\nwhich ran over its legs, without ever discovering there was food within\r\ntheir reach. So fixed was its instinctive knowledge that its safety\r\ndepended on its immovability, that it allowed me to pick it up and\r\nreplace it amongst the ants without making a single effort to escape. It\r\nmight easily have escaped from the ants by using its wings, but it would\r\nonly have fallen into as great a danger, for the numerous birds that\r\naccompany the army of ants are ever on the outlook for any insect that\r\nmay fly up, and the heavy flying locusts, grasshoppers, and cockroaches\r\nhave no chance of escape.”[92] This locust resembled a green leaf which,\r\nas we have seen, was a very protective resemblance indeed. It might,\r\nhowever, had it been a smaller insect, have resembled one of the ants\r\nthemselves, and in that case could have run about with them, pretending\r\nor appearing to forage, also with perfect impunity. Whether the _Eciton_\r\nhas such a double I know not, but various ants have. With some it is a\r\nspider that assumes their form. With others, as we have seen to a\r\npartial extent, a caterpillar, but the _Sauba_, or leaf-cutting\r\nant—which is also the mushroom-growing one—is understudied, leaf and\r\nall, by an insect which, though the order to which it belongs has been\r\ndetermined, has not yet apparently received a name. “An example,” says\r\nProfessor Poulton, “of protective mimicry, which I believe to be more\r\nwonderful in its detail and complexity than any which has been hitherto\r\ndescribed, was observed and interpreted by my friend Mr. W. L. Sclater,\r\nin 1886, during his investigations in British Guiana. Mr. Sclater and\r\nhis native servant had been collecting insects by shaking the branches\r\nof a tree over a sheet. The servant, although described as a very acute\r\nobserver, saw an insect on the sheet which he mistook for one of the\r\nabundant Cooshie ants (perhaps the native name), carrying its little\r\njagged segment of leaf over its back. Mr. Sclater looked more closely,\r\nand saw that it was an entirely different insect belonging to the order\r\n_Homoptera_. Its length was about that of an ant carrying its leaf. The\r\nleaf was represented by the thin flattened body of the insect which in\r\nits dorsal part is so compressed laterally that it is no thicker than a\r\nleaf” (or as we would say, which along the back is no thicker than a\r\nleaf), “and terminates in a sharp, jagged edge. The head and legs were\r\nbrown, and suggested the appearance of that part of an ant which is\r\nuncovered by the piece of leaf. The jagged dorsal line, when seen in\r\nprofile, evidently corresponds to the roughly gnawed edge of the\r\nfragment of leaf, for Mr. Sclater tells me that the contour of the\r\nlatter is generally shaped by the mandibles of the ant rather than due\r\nto the natural margin.”[93]\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned insect is a dweller in trees, and one might have\r\nsupposed that a general resemblance to the leaves among which it moves\r\nwould have been a sufficient protection for it. This probably was the\r\nbeginning of the deception, which became more complex as time went on.\r\nIn the leaf-like back of the insect we see probably the original\r\ndisguise, but as the eyes of birds became more acute they began to\r\npierce through it, more especially when the creature walked. Round about\r\nthe would-be leaf, however, the leaf-cutting ants—distasteful to the\r\nbirds that so affected it—were constantly moving and walking. If only it\r\ncould get to resemble one of these it might be as active as it pleased,\r\nand especially if its motions, as well as its appearance, became ant- or\r\nant and leaf-like. And this, indeed, was what gradually began to take\r\nplace. Variation was always going on, and natural selection was always\r\nat hand to mould and shape its results. The two insects were, to begin\r\nwith, of much the same size, and the general leaf-like appearance of the\r\none was a good basis on which the more particular resemblance to the cut\r\npiece of leaf, carried by the other, might be founded. A few deeper\r\nwashes of brown, some not very profound modifications of contour, and an\r\nant-suggesting legs and body began to appear beneath it. Meanwhile,\r\nhowever, hundreds of thousands—nay, millions—of bad or mediocre copies\r\nwere swept away, the species became rarer and rarer—trembled, perhaps,\r\non the verge of extinction; but just when it might have appeared to the\r\nbirds, who were no longer able to obtain a once much-enjoyed morsel,\r\nthat it really was extinct, it was saved; nature’s object had been\r\ngained. A certain number of individuals were left, were close at hand\r\neven; even now, at that very moment, one might be crawling on the same\r\ntwig where a despondent bird sat, only it was not to be distinguished\r\nfrom a leaf-cutting ant. Such are the ways of nature, such the slaughter\r\nthat attends her victories.\r\n\r\nIn Borneo, and the Malay Archipelago generally, there is a pretty pink\r\nflower known as the “Straits Rhododendron.” Once a gentleman was looking\r\nat one of these flowers and admiring it, when all at once it turned\r\nround and stared him in the face. It was not a flower, but a mantis; its\r\nflattened legs—pink like them—made the petals; its abdomen, turned up\r\nover the back and held thus motionless, resembled an opening bud. “When\r\nI held the branch on which the insect had established itself in my hand\r\nI could not tell exactly where animal tissue commenced and where flower\r\nended, so perfectly was the one assimilated to the other, both in colour\r\nand surface-texture.”[94] When once established on a flower this mantis\r\nwould remain there quite motionless, if undisturbed, until it had\r\noccasion to leave it; and of course, in nature, had any insect settled\r\non or near it, it would have instantly been seized. The ways of the\r\nmantis are well known. “Under a most sanctimonious aspect,” says Fabre,\r\nspeaking of the little green one of Provence, “it hides the morals of a\r\ncannibal”;[95] and, indeed, the female, which is larger and stronger\r\nthan the male, will often turn upon the latter and devour it in the very\r\nmidst of a love-passage. This it does, as in all other cases, by\r\nsuddenly launching forward one or both of its fore-arms—which have been\r\npreviously held in an attitude of prayer—and enclosing the body of the\r\nvictim between their first and second segments, each of which is toothed\r\nalong the edge like a saw. The double row of teeth meet in the body,\r\nwhich, held aloft, and writhing on either side of the trap, is devoured\r\npiecemeal by the mantis, who, with its sharp jaws, tears little\r\nmouthfuls out of it as long as it, or its appetite, lasts. This process,\r\nmade more interesting by the way in which it was brought about, was\r\nwitnessed in the case of the above-mentioned species. Small flies\r\nfrequently settled upon it as it sat motionless, flower-like amidst\r\nflowers. “These it made no attempt either to drive off or to capture;\r\nits motions seeming rather to attract than repel them. After a short\r\ntime a larger _Dipteron_, as big as a common house-fly, alighted on the\r\ninflorescence within reach of the predatory limbs. Then the mantis\r\nbecame active immediately; the fly was seized, torn in pieces, and\r\ndevoured.”[96] Such are the real propensities of the seeming flower, and\r\nsuch, too, it may be observed, are those of some actual flowers—to wit,\r\ninsectivorous ones.\r\n\r\nTo the Malays, however, whose minds are not yet open to the doctrines of\r\nprotective or aggressive resemblance, or to evolution generally, this\r\nmantis _is_ a flower, they “know not seems.” The blossoms of “the\r\n_sendudok_” have become alive, and perhaps some analogies suggested by\r\ntheir own life-experience temper their surprise at such an apparent\r\nchange of disposition. They say, too, that few men ever see more than\r\none flower-mantis in the whole course of their lives, so rare a creature\r\nis it. In this, no doubt, they are right; yet it would be possible,\r\nperhaps, even for a Malay to see several without knowing anything about\r\nit. Native eyes are almost always sharper and better than those of the\r\nEuropeans who come amongst them; but, on the other hand, no native goes\r\nabout like a modern entomologist, with his eyes specially open in one\r\ndirection and the possibilities of protective resemblance in his mind.\r\n\r\nThe same naturalist, during the same expedition, was singularly\r\ndelighted to secure a larva, whose resemblance to a snake was “so\r\nstartlingly accurate that I was, for a moment, completely deceived.”[96]\r\nA description follows which, as it is of that kind which deals longly\r\nand learnedly in details without producing any particular general\r\neffect, may be left out. It would seem, however, that this caterpillar,\r\nlike many others, has the power of withdrawing its actual head into a\r\nfold or two of its skin, which is here so marked that it performs the\r\noffice of a mask, obscuring and taking the place of the real head thus\r\nobliterated. The mask is furnished with two spots, which at once become\r\nthe creature’s eyes, and both in colour, shape, and general appearance\r\nbear a remarkable resemblance to those of a snake; whilst a wrinkled\r\nfold, running back on either side from what appears to be the snout,\r\nsuggests the mouth, and the flattened head with its characteristic\r\narrangement of broad, flattened scales is also indicated by certain\r\nmarkings and colours on the required part of the caterpillar’s body. An\r\napparent head like this, thrown suddenly up as though threatening to\r\ndart forward with a hiss and distended jaws, might alarm anyone, and\r\nsuch a mock demonstration is evidently required to give full effect to\r\nthe disguise. Thus we are told that “when the larva was moving about\r\nwith the anterior segments well expanded the resemblance to a snake was\r\nnot so startling; but directly it was touched the terrifying attitude\r\nwas assumed, the anterior segments being drawn in and the front of the\r\nbody turned towards the aggressor. When, at the same time, the hinder\r\npart of the body was hidden by leaves the deception became complete, and\r\nif effective enough to deceive, even temporarily, a human being, it must\r\nsurely be equally effective in deterring less highly organised and timid\r\nfoes.”\r\n\r\nFor the “timid” certainly, but for the “less highly organised” the\r\nconclusion does not seem so plain. No sight is better than a bird’s,\r\nand it is practice that makes perfect in any particular direction.\r\nStill, unless we suppose the disguise to be accidental merely—and this\r\nno one with a knowledge of the whole subject can do—the object of it\r\nseems clearly apparent, and we may, therefore, assume that, on the\r\nwhole, it is successful—to the extent, at any rate, of keeping the\r\nspecies in existence. In such matters, however, there is nothing like\r\npractical experiments, if one has the chance of making them, as the\r\nfinder of the caterpillar in question must have had, since he says,\r\n“Unfortunately I was unable to test the efficacy of the disguise, for\r\nfear of losing the larva, which I was anxious to rear for the purpose\r\nof identification.”[96] To me this appears a false judgment. Such a\r\ntest would have been much more interesting, surely, especially if\r\nresulting in the way anticipated, than a dry pinned specimen and a\r\nLatin name.\r\n\r\nAnother large snake-resembling caterpillar was found by Bates in the\r\nforests of Brazil, and the likeness was sufficiently striking to alarm\r\nseveral people to whom he showed it. But it is not necessary to go so\r\nfar afield, for here in England, according to Professor Poulton, we have\r\nan excellent example of this kind of protective resemblance. This is no\r\nother than the caterpillar of the elephant hawk-moth, which by\r\nwithdrawing its head into its body—just as does the Bornean\r\nspecies—produces a similar false face, with a pair, or, indeed, two\r\npairs of fierce-looking eyes.[97] This caterpillar feeds on the great\r\nwillow herb, and when at rest keeps amongst the dead brown leaves at the\r\nbase of the stem. “As soon,” says Professor Poulton, “as the leaves are\r\nrustled by an approaching enemy, the caterpillar swiftly draws its head\r\nand the three first body-rings into the two next rings, bearing the\r\neye-like marks. These two rings are thus swollen, and look like the head\r\nof the animal, upon which four enormous, terrible-looking eyes are\r\nprominent. The effect is greatly heightened by the suddenness of the\r\ntransformation, which endows an innocent-looking and inconspicuous\r\nanimal with a terrifying and serpent-like appearance.”[98]\r\n\r\nWith this caterpillar, since naturalists know what to call it, and there\r\nis no chance of its handing down any of their names in Latin to\r\nposterity, it has been possible to make experiments, and on the whole\r\nperhaps they have been in favour of the protective resemblance theory.\r\nThe most interesting one—that I have read, that is to say—was made by\r\nProfessor Poulton with a full-sized green lizard, and is thus described\r\nby him: “The lizard was evidently suspicious, and yet afraid to attack\r\nthe caterpillar, which maintained the terrifying attitude in the most\r\ncomplete manner throughout. The lizard kept boldly advancing, and then\r\nretreating in fright; but at each advance it approached rather nearer to\r\nthe caterpillar. After this had taken place many times and nothing had\r\nhappened, the lizard grew bolder and ventured to gently bite what\r\nappeared to be the head of the caterpillar; it then swiftly retired, but\r\nfinding that there was no retaliation it again advanced and gave it a\r\nrather harder bite. After a few bites had been given in this cautious\r\nmanner, the lizard appeared satisfied that the whole thing was a fraud,\r\nand devoured the caterpillar in the ordinary manner.”[98] Professor\r\nPoulton has no doubt as to the lizard having been alarmed at first by\r\nthe appearance of the caterpillar, and adds that he has never seen one\r\nact in the same way on any other occasion; other large hawk-moth\r\ncaterpillars being eaten at once with entire _sang-froid_. It may be\r\nobserved, however, that if every lizard were to act in the way recorded,\r\nunder natural conditions, the advantage to the caterpillar would be nil,\r\nsince though a species may survive through not being eaten, it certainly\r\nwill not through being eaten with hesitation. And why should a lizard be\r\nmore timid in the open air than in a box or a fern-case? Unless we\r\nassume, therefore, that this particular one was bolder than most others\r\nwould be, the result of the experiment was not for, but against, the\r\ntheory it was designed to test; and since we have no business to assume,\r\nthe only thing to do is to get more caterpillars, and give them to more\r\nlizards. Small birds, however—and this in a country like England is more\r\nto the point—seem really to fear these pseudo-snakes to the extent of\r\nflying away from them.[99] But would an ordinary large caterpillar of\r\nthe _Sphingidæ_—say, of a privet hawk or death’s-head moth—frighten them\r\nin the same way? If so, then again we are nowhere.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a still more extraordinary instance of protective resemblance\r\nthan any of the foregoing is that of a caterpillar which pretends to be\r\nan ant—one provided with an efficient sting, and of an irritable\r\ndisposition. Here, as in the snake cases, it is by one portion of the\r\nbody only that the fraud is perpetrated, but this, instead of being the\r\nfront, is the hind part, in which, perhaps, it offers a unique example\r\nof the sort. The colour of the caterpillar is exactly that of the ant,\r\nand whilst its extremity represents the latter’s head, two black spots\r\nwhich are there situated bear an equally close resemblance to the eyes.\r\nThe jaws are represented by the last pair of false legs or claspers,\r\nwhich are of disproportionate size, and can upon occasion be stretched\r\nwidely apart, whilst a number of thin, tentacle-like processes, attached\r\nin pairs to the segments of the body, have all the appearance of an\r\nant’s legs and antennæ. Armed with these properties, which, however, in\r\na state of quiescence are not very recognisable, the caterpillar waits,\r\nas one may say, to have its feelings ruffled, when, by flinging the\r\nhinder part of its body into the air, each separate appurtenance begins\r\nat once to act the part assigned it, and the whole becomes a startling\r\nmake-up. The head, with eyes, is jerked from side to side, the jaws\r\ngape, the legs move, the antennæ quiver, and an angry, threatening ant\r\nstarts, as by magic, into being. “When,” says Mr. Annandale, “the\r\ncaterpillar is seen in an end-on position, or when the anterior\r\ntwo-thirds of the body are hidden, the resemblance is positively\r\nstartling,” so that “it is difficult to imagine how a lizard or a frog\r\nwith a previous experience of the ant could fail to be deterred.”[100]\r\n\r\nIn the light of the above cases, that of the cuckoo-bees does not seem\r\nso very wonderful, since both the species are bees, and all or most of\r\nthe members of any group or family of animals as a rule bear some\r\nresemblance to one another, since they descend from a common and not\r\nvery remote ancestor. Many flies, however, have almost as close a\r\nresemblance to various bees and wasps, whilst one of the latter is even\r\nthe model for a species of cricket, which would otherwise fall a victim\r\nto it and others of its family. There is a beetle, too, so like a wasp,\r\nnot only in its appearance, but in the way in which it runs about and\r\nmoves its antennæ, that anyone almost would be taken in. Whether, under\r\nthis disguise, it enters wasps’ nests and preys upon the larvæ, as the\r\nbee-like _Volucella_ flies enter the nests of the humble-bees they\r\nimitate, I do not know, nor, I think, does anyone, but this might very\r\nwell be the case. These flies, however, now I come to think of it, do\r\nnot really injure the bees. It used to be the idea that they did, but\r\nlately it has been discovered that they are only scavengers, feeding on\r\nall the waste products of their hosts, and even on their dead bodies\r\nshould such opportunities arise.[101] The humble-bees, on their part,\r\nseem to appreciate these services, though we are not entitled to say\r\nthat they admit the flies into their nests on this account, since they\r\nprobably do so owing to their likeness to themselves.\r\n\r\nOf the walking-stick insects, which are hardly to be distinguished, even\r\nwith close attention, from the grass or twigs on which they cling,\r\neveryone has heard or read, and the caterpillars, common enough in\r\nEngland, which remain motionless, projecting like a twig from its stem,\r\nand looking just the same as one, are almost as good instances of\r\nunconscious deception. But neither these caterpillars, nor any of the\r\nother insects that have been mentioned, do anything, except through the\r\nattitudes they assume, to produce their wonderful disguises. They have\r\nnothing to do with the cutting out of the material. They do not dress up\r\nfor the part themselves. That, however, is what some caterpillars do.\r\nThere is one, for instance, in Borneo, that has a number of spines\r\narranged in pairs down its back, and on each of these spines it fixes\r\nseveral little buds of the plant on which it is feeding, such buds, and\r\nnot the leaves of the plant, being the actual food it eats. Consequently\r\nthe caterpillar, which is quite a small one, looks like a spray of tiny\r\nbuds itself, and can hardly, by possibility, be noticed amidst its\r\nflowery chaplet. The buds are not impaled on the spines, as might be\r\nsupposed, but are attached to them with silk, which the caterpillar\r\nweaves for the purpose, and the whole process of the thing has been\r\nobserved by the gentleman who gives the account, and who is no less\r\ncompetent a person than the curator of the Sarawak Museum. This is what\r\nhe says: “A bud would be shorn off with the mandibles, then held in the\r\ntwo front pairs of legs, and covered all over with silk issuing from the\r\nmouth of the caterpillar. The caterpillar then twisted the front part of\r\nits body round, and attached with silk the bud to one of the spinous\r\nprocesses, and another bud would then be attached to this, and so on\r\nuntil a sufficiently long string—generally three or four buds—was made,\r\nwhen operations on another spine would be commenced. The caterpillar fed\r\non these buds, scooping out the interior, and when not hurried, using\r\nthe empty shells in preference to whole buds for its covering. When\r\nirritated it curled up, and remained thus for fifteen or twenty minutes.\r\nAt other times it would sway about, looking like a branchlet blown by\r\nthe breeze.”[102]\r\n\r\nIn time this caterpillar made “a silk cocoon covered with buds,” but it\r\nnever turned into a butterfly, for ants attacked it, and its life was\r\nnipped in the bud. It appears to be a very rare caterpillar, and nobody\r\nknows what butterfly it belongs to, or what is its full Latin name.\r\nSince it is a _Geometer_, however, why not _Geometer ignota_ under a\r\nsketch (as given in _Nature_, June 25th, 1903), in the cabinet—which\r\nwould, in all cases, be the better plan?\r\n\r\nI really do not know whether this or another caterpillar of South\r\nAmerica be the more extraordinary, for if the one makes itself like\r\nsomething, the other makes something like itself. _Anæa_ (_sp?_)—I give\r\nthe name as I find it—is a little green caterpillar having a very funny\r\nnondescript sort of shape—as much like a little piece of gnawed-out\r\nleaf, left hanging to the midrib, as anything else. Such an object,\r\nhowever, is not one of the common ones of nature, and if it stood alone\r\nmight be unrecognised or misinterpreted. The caterpillar, therefore,\r\nfeeding along the midrib of the leaf, gnaws out a number of such little\r\npieces, more or less like itself, and leaves them sticking upright along\r\nit, attached by a point or two. All the rest of the leaf at that part of\r\nthe midrib, it apparently eats, or bites away, so that there remains\r\nonly the slender, bare stalk, with several bits of leaf upon it, one of\r\nwhich is the caterpillar. To say which bit is he is now very difficult,\r\nand it looks as if none of them were. This caterpillar is, of course,\r\ngreen, like the leaf he feeds on, but he is not the same colour all\r\nover. He is light above and dark below, and this exactly suits—I have it\r\non authority—the chiaroscuro of the situation, so that, both in light\r\nand shadow, he looks for all the world like a little elongated bit of\r\ngreen leaf attached to the midrib by a couple of stalks.[103] One would\r\nsay, “Some caterpillars must have been eating that leaf”; but one would\r\nnever think the caterpillar that had been eating it was still there.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 91:\r\n\r\n  Bates, The Naturalist on the River Amazon (second edition, 1864), p.\r\n  420.\r\n\r\nFootnote 92:\r\n\r\n  Belt, The Naturalist in Nicaragua, pp. 19, 20.\r\n\r\nFootnote 93:\r\n\r\n  Proc.

This is the\r\nworld-renowned leaf butterfly of Sumatra, and elsewhere in the Malay\r\nArchipelago. Of the great purple emperor family, it is purple on the\r\nupper surface, and gleams like a meteor as it shoots about in the rich,\r\nsun-bathed atmosphere of the tropics, its conspicuousness being enhanced\r\nby a sort of miniature, sharp-pointed swallow-tail, in which the hinder\r\npair of wings end, and a broad, orange bar, like a sash or scarf of\r\nhonour, running right across the anterior wings. It flies boldly and\r\nstrongly, and when it descends upon a bush or shrub it is as though a\r\nlittle purple torch had shot through the foliage; but all at once, even\r\nthough you see it come down just in front of you, it has vanished\r\nutterly—the torch has gone out. You may look and look, but unless you\r\nknow the trick, and have seen the settling, and never taken your eyes\r\noff the exact spot, you will never find the butterfly, or see anything\r\nmore of it until, all at once, it gleams in the air again. For the under\r\npart of the leaf butterfly’s lovely purple wings is like the leaf\r\nindeed—“the sere, the yellow leaf”—with a midrib running down the centre\r\nveinings on either side, a curled tip at the top, a stalk at the bottom,\r\nand everything proper to leaves, but not as a rule to butterflies. All\r\nfour wings join in this effect, for being thrown up in the usual way\r\nwhen the insect settles, the leaf-like shape is thus brought about,\r\none-half of the under surface being seen on each side in clear profile,\r\nwhilst the purple now lies hid within, like the pictures on a folded\r\nscreen. As for the body of the butterfly, that is hidden inside the\r\nwings too; the legs are all but invisible, and the two little pointed\r\nswallow-tails, just touching the plant’s stem with their mutual tip,\r\nmake the stalk of the leaf. Even on the wall of a room or a curtain it\r\nwould seem as though a dead leaf were sticking there; how much more\r\nwhen, as is always the case, the butterfly flies into some bush or\r\nthicket crowded with dry, brown leaves, and settles all amongst them. It\r\nis not that you don’t see it there that makes you miss it, but that you\r\nsee it and scores of brown leaves all about it, every one of which looks\r\njust the same as itself.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROTECTIVE MIMICRY]\r\n\r\n    The picture at the top shows birds pursuing butterflies, while\r\n      in the one below the same birds have lost their prey, as the\r\n      butterflies have alighted and show only the underside of\r\n      their wings, which are practically indistinguishable from\r\n      the neighbouring leaves.\r\n\r\nTo make the matter plainer, in case this is not a very accurate\r\ndescription, here is the account of an eye-witness: “This species,” says\r\nDr. Wallace, “was not uncommon in dry woods and thickets, and I often\r\nendeavoured to capture it without success, for after flying a short\r\ndistance it would enter a bush among dry or dead leaves, and however\r\ncarefully I crept up to the spot, I could never discover it till it\r\nwould suddenly dart out again, and then disappear in a similar place. At\r\nlength I was fortunate enough to see the exact spot where the butterfly\r\nsettled, and though I lost sight of it for some time, I at length\r\ndiscovered that it was close before my eyes, but that in its position of\r\nrepose it so closely resembled a dead leaf attached to a twig as almost\r\ncertainly to deceive the eye, even when gazing full upon it.” Then\r\nfollows a minute explanation of the imposture. “The end of the upper\r\nwings terminates in a fine point, just as the leaves of many tropical\r\nshrubs and trees are pointed, while the lower wings are somewhat more\r\nobtuse, and are lengthened out into a short, thick tail. Between these\r\ntwo points there runs a dark, curved line exactly representing the\r\nmidrib of a leaf, and from this radiate on each side a few oblique\r\nmarks, which well imitate the lateral veins. The tint of the under\r\nsurface varies much, but it is always some ashy brown or reddish colour,\r\nwhich matches with those of dead leaves. The habit of the species is\r\nalways to rest on a twig and among dead or dry leaves, and in this\r\nposition, with the wings closely pressed together, their outline is\r\nexactly that of a moderately-sized leaf, slightly curved or shrivelled.\r\nThe tail of the hind wings forms a perfect stalk, and touches the stick,\r\nwhile the insect is supported by the middle pair of legs, which are not\r\nnoticed among the twigs and fibres that surround it. The head and\r\nantennæ are drawn back between the wings, so as to be quite concealed,\r\nand there is a little notch hollowed out at the very base of the wings,\r\nwhich allows the head to be retracted sufficiently. All these varied\r\ndetails combine to produce a disguise that is so complete and marvellous\r\nas to astonish everyone who observes it, and the habits of the insect\r\nare such as to utilise all these peculiarities, and render them\r\navailable in such a manner as to remove all doubt of the purpose of this\r\nsingular case of mimicry, which is undoubtedly a protection to the\r\ninsect. Its strong and swift flight is sufficient to save it from its\r\nenemies when on the wing, but if it were equally conspicuous when at\r\nrest it could not long escape extinction, owing to the attacks of the\r\ninsectivorous birds and reptiles that abound in the tropical\r\nforests.”[104]\r\n\r\nDr. Wallace then speaks of another closely allied species which is\r\ncommon in India, on the under surface of whose wings there are\r\nsometimes, to the boot of all that has been described, in the way of\r\ndisguise, “patches and spots formed of small black dots, so closely\r\nresembling the way in which minute fungi grow on leaves that it is\r\nalmost impossible, at first, not to believe that fungi have grown on the\r\nbutterflies themselves.”[104] The minuteness of a resemblance like this\r\nis really very surprising, for it seems as though the butterfly-hunting\r\nbird or insect—some powerful wasp may represent the latter—was capable\r\nof minutely examining the object in question, and saying to itself, as\r\nit were, “I don’t think that can be a leaf, because there are no black\r\nspots upon it,” or _vice versâ_. In reality, however, it is no doubt the\r\ngeneral effect, to which every detail contributes, that tells. What such\r\nresemblances do seem to me to show—and this, I think, is a new idea—is\r\nthe accuracy and precision of some insects’ sight. How insects see\r\nthings has long been a question, and many, I suppose, think it quite\r\nuncertain whether a leaf, for instance, throws the same picture on their\r\nretina that it does on ours. But if, to deceive them, the copy must be\r\nsuch that it also deceives us, is it not clear that it does? Otherwise\r\nthe effect of the original could probably be reproduced by a less\r\naccurate copy. How little, after all, does the finest painting really\r\nresemble nature! The effect alone does so, not the means by which it is\r\narrived at. Surely, then, if an insect, looking at a leaf or any other\r\nobject, received but a general impression of colour, with an outline\r\nmore or less blurred, or ill-defined, these copies of nature by\r\nnature—made to deceive—would bear witness to the fact. A study of\r\nprotective resemblances is perhaps the best way of forming an idea as to\r\nhow creatures, other than ourselves, see the world. It is even possible\r\nthat such resemblances exist, which we, because we see things\r\ndifferently, are totally incapable of detecting.\r\n\r\nI do not know if any other striking case of resemblance to an inanimate\r\nobject (if plant life can be included under this term) is offered by the\r\nbutterfly world, though there are several more of the same kind, but I\r\ncannot remember one just now. No doubt there are many which have not yet\r\nbeen discovered. We have, however, various instances of concealment even\r\nhere in England, as, for instance, the peacock butterfly; but these, as\r\nwell as special resemblances, are, for the most part, more marked in\r\nmoths. The lappet moth, indeed, though it does not quite get the shape,\r\nlooks very like a dead brown leaf, whilst in the buff-tip moth we are\r\nsupposed to have a special resemblance to a piece of rotting wood,\r\nclothed with moss or lichen, and broken at each end. Personally, I have\r\nnever received the impression of such a definite object, but only a\r\ngeneral one of rot and decay. Even here, however, I do not believe I\r\ncould ever be taken in, for the yellow head and tips of the wings, which\r\nare supposed to offer a perfect resemblance to the two broken ends of\r\nthe piece of wood, are to me the tell-tale parts, and instantly cry out,\r\n“Moth!” In fact, soft as is the colouring of the buff-tip, it still\r\nseems to me a salient object, and I do not think very much of that\r\nbird’s eyesight who fails to detect it under anything like favourable\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nAnother moth that flies by day, and is not uncommon in the United\r\nStates, bears, when sitting on a leaf, a much stronger resemblance to a\r\nbird-dropping, but in this not uncommon form of imitation moths, and all\r\nother insects, are outdone by spiders, who use it aggressively against\r\nthem, and particularly, it would seem, against butterflies, as the\r\nfollowing instances will show. Mr. Forbes once, whilst travelling in\r\nJava, saw a butterfly settled upon a bird-dropping. He watched it for\r\nsome time, and then, wondering at its long stay, approached cautiously,\r\nand, slowly extending his hand, actually caught it by its wings, between\r\nhis finger and thumb—no mean feat, as it seemed, yet there was nothing\r\nto boast of. As he lifted the butterfly only the wings came away, the\r\nrest of it staying with the supposed bird-dropping, which was now seen\r\nto be a spider, who, having caught the butterfly by means of this\r\nshameful imposture, was quietly occupied in eating it. The disguise in\r\nthis case was of the most wonderful perfection. “Such excreta,” says Mr.\r\nForbes, who discovered this one, “consist of a central and denser\r\nportion of a pure white, chalk-like colour, streaked here and there with\r\nblack, and surrounded by a thin border of the dried-up, more fluid\r\npart.”[105] The appearance of each of these constituent parts was\r\nsuccessfully counterfeited by the spider in question, who, in its own\r\nperson, represented the more solid material, and spun the rest with its\r\nweb.\r\n\r\nAs I know from early experience, when a naturalist makes a prize, all at\r\nonce, of some interesting specimen, for some time afterwards he expects,\r\nor, rather, feels as if he would see some other on every leaf or twig;\r\nbut time went by and no more of these “vain, delusive” spiders presented\r\nthemselves. At length, years afterwards, the same naturalist found\r\nhimself by the banks of the Moesi river, in Sumatra (which sounds much\r\nmore interesting than the Thames, for instance), and this was his second\r\nexperience. “I was,” he says, “rather dreamily looking on the shrubs\r\nbefore me, when I became conscious of my eyes resting on a\r\nbird-excreta-marked leaf. How strange, I thought, it is that I have\r\nnever got another specimen of that curious spider I found in Java, which\r\nsimulated a patch just like this! I plucked the leaf by the petiole\r\nwhile so cogitating and looked at it half-listlessly for some moments,\r\nmentally remarking how closely that other spider had copied nature,\r\nwhen, to my delighted surprise, I discovered that I had actually secured\r\na second specimen, but the imitation was so exquisite that I really did\r\nnot perceive how matters stood for several moments. The spider never\r\nmoved while I was plucking or twirling the leaf, and it was only when I\r\nplaced the tip of my little finger on it that I observed that it was a\r\nspider, when it, without any displacement of itself, flashed its falces\r\ninto my flesh.”[105] (He means it bit him.)\r\n\r\nNot all butterflies are entrapped by the kind of simulacrum here\r\nnoticed. Nature can adapt herself to every taste, and in South Africa\r\nthere are spiders who make themselves attractive by appearing to be\r\nflowers. Of some of these and their _modus operandi_ Mr. Rowland Trimen,\r\nwho was curator of the Cape Town Museum, gives the following interesting\r\naccount: “Many species of spiders,” he says, “are well adapted to\r\nsucceed by being coloured in resemblance to the flowers in or on which\r\nthey await the arrival of their victims. One that inhabits Cape Town is\r\nof the exact rose-red of the flowers of the oleander, and, to more\r\neffectually conceal it, the palpi, top of the cephalothorax, and four\r\nlateral stripes on the abdomen, are white, according remarkably with the\r\nirregular white markings so frequent on the petals of _Nerium_.”[106]\r\nThese, indeed, must be beautiful spiders, and one would like to hear a\r\nlittle more of them, but Mr. Trimen goes at once from red to yellow. “I\r\nwas led,” he continues, “to notice a yellow spider of the same group in\r\nconsequence of seeing that two of a number of butterflies on the flowers\r\nof _Senecio pulugera_ did not, on my approach, fly off with their\r\ncompanions. Each of these unfortunates turned out to be in the clutches\r\nof a spider, and when I released them I observed their captors very\r\nnarrowly, and I found that the latter’s close resemblance to the\r\n_Senecio_ flowers was not one of colour alone, but due also to attitude.\r\nThis spider, holding on to the flower stalk by the two hinder pairs of\r\nlegs, extended the two long front pairs upward and laterally. In this\r\nposition it was scarcely possible to believe that it was not a flower\r\nseen in profile, the rounded abdomen representing the central mass of\r\nflorets and the extended legs the ray florets, while to complete the\r\nillusion the femora of the front pair of legs, adpressed to the thorax,\r\nhave each a longitudinal red stripe, which represents the ferruginous\r\nstripe on the sepals of the flower.”[106]\r\n\r\nLater on, Mr. Trimen was so fortunate as actually to see a butterfly\r\ncaught by another flowery impostor:—“The butterfly,” he tells us, “was\r\nengaged in honey-sucking on a white flower-head of _Lantana_, and\r\nexplored each individual flower with its proboscis. While I was watching\r\nit, the butterfly touched and partly walked over what looked like a\r\nslightly folded or crumpled flower about the middle of the cluster. This\r\nturned out to be a spider, which instantly seized the butterfly,\r\nthrowing forward its front legs, somewhat after the fashion of a mantis.\r\nIn this spider the effect of the little depressions on the limb of the\r\ncorolla was given by some depressed lines on the back of its smooth\r\nwhite abdomen.”[106]\r\n\r\nOther spiders resemble snail-shells, others ants, and one, at least, is\r\nlike a small scorpion, but we will return to the butterflies. As I have\r\nsaid, except for that wonderful copy of a leaf, already described, I\r\ncannot think of any very extraordinary resemblances amongst them,\r\nbelonging to that class, but there are others which form a little class\r\nof their own. In the last chapter we have seen bees imitating bees, and\r\nin this we will make the acquaintance of certain butterflies which, as\r\nit were, pretend to be of a species which they do not really belong to.\r\nThus in Brazil, by the great River Amazons, a number of large showy\r\nbutterflies are found which belong to the family of the _Heliconea_, and\r\nwherever these fly they are accompanied by various other butterflies,\r\nbelonging to quite different families, which are nevertheless so\r\nextremely like them that even Mr. Bates, who, for eleven years, ran up\r\nand down the Amazons with a butterfly-net in his hand, could never be\r\nquite sure which kind it was that he was going to catch. Often, when he\r\nthought he had got a _Heliconea_ he was perfectly thunderstruck to find\r\nit was really a _Papilio_, _Pieris_, _Euterpe_, _Leptalis_,\r\n_Protogonius_, _Ithoneis_, _Dioptis_, _Pericopis_, _Hyelosia_, or\r\nsomething of that sort; or again, when it was one of these he was after,\r\nand at last he thought he had it in the net, he would be petrified, on\r\nlooking more closely, to find that what he had really caught was a\r\n_Heliconea_.\r\n\r\nBut now, as all these butterflies were alike or nearly alike, how could\r\nMr. Bates tell—or how had anybody been able to tell before him—that they\r\nwere really not all the same species—that a _Heliconea_ was not a\r\n_Papilio_, or that a _Papilio_, _Pieris_, _Euterpe_, etc., were not all\r\nof them _Heliconeas_? This, at first sight, seems a difficult question\r\nto answer, but really it is not, because, in all these families of\r\nbutterflies, the various species composing them bear a kind of\r\ngeneralised resemblance to one another: there is a family likeness, in\r\nfact, and this is not only the case in regard to their outward\r\nappearance—the shape and colour of their wings, etc.—but it applies, in\r\na still greater degree, to their structure and internal economy. Thus,\r\nhowever strongly a _Pieris_, or one of those others, might resemble a\r\n_Heliconea_, the trained eye of an entomologist could easily see that it\r\nreally was a member of another family, and since, in resembling the\r\n_Heliconea_, it departed from the general type of pattern and colouring\r\nexhibited by the family to which it belonged, whilst this one species of\r\n_Heliconea_ it resembled was like the others, it might be inferred that\r\nthe latter was the imitated and not the imitating form. Again—and this\r\nis still more decisive evidence in the cases where it applies—the\r\nresemblance is often confined to one sex of the copying species, viz.\r\nthe female, so that whilst she is hardly to be distinguished from the\r\nmodel on which she has founded herself, the male retains the appearance,\r\ntogether with all the other characteristics, of the race to which both\r\nhe and she belong.\r\n\r\nBut now came a further question, the most puzzling or, at any rate, the\r\nmost important one of all, viz. Why should the one butterfly imitate, or\r\nrather resemble the other, in such an extraordinary degree—a degree\r\nseeming to preclude the possibility of mere chance having brought it\r\nabout? This question Mr. Bates is supposed to have been the first to\r\nanswer, though I cannot help thinking, myself, that he has only extended\r\nan explanation, which, in some cases, was so obvious that no one had\r\nthought of pointing it out, to these other cases where it was not nearly\r\nso easy to see. For what can be plainer, as Mr. Bates himself remarks,\r\nthan that a moth, for instance, by closely resembling a hornet, would\r\nescape the attacks of birds that might otherwise have devoured it? I\r\ncannot think but that so patent an explanation had been in the minds of\r\nmany long before 1862, and though no one previous to that date may have\r\napplied the principle of natural selection to such cases, it must be\r\nremembered that natural selection had been established by Darwin some\r\nten or twelve years before.\r\n\r\nBates, however, besides making an ingenious application of the above\r\nprinciple to a special case, gave a real reason for something which was\r\nnot at all obvious, viz. why one butterfly should be a gainer by closely\r\nresembling another; and this no one had hitherto been able to do. His\r\nsurmise, which has since in many instances been confirmed, is as\r\nfollows. Having first pointed out that the _Heliconea_ butterflies are a\r\nnumerous, flourishing race, whilst those species that imitate them are\r\npoor in numbers, he says, “What advantages the _Heliconidæ_ possess to\r\nmake them so flourishing a group, and, consequently, the object of so\r\nmuch mimetic resemblance, it is not easy to discover. There is nothing\r\napparent in their structure or habits which could render them safe from\r\npersecution by the numerous insectivorous animals which are constantly\r\non the watch in the same parts of the forest which they inhabit. It is\r\nprobable they are unpalatable to insect enemies. Some of them have\r\nglands near the end of the abdomen which they protrude when roughly\r\nhandled; it is well known that similar organs in other families secrete\r\nfetid liquids or gases and that these serve as a protection to the\r\nspecies. They have all a peculiar smell. I never saw the flocks of\r\nslow-flying _Heliconidæ_ in the woods persecuted by birds or\r\ndragon-flies, to which they would have been easy prey; nor when at rest\r\non leaves did they appear to be molested by lizards, or the predaceous\r\nflies which were very often seen pouncing on butterflies of other\r\nfamilies. If they owe their flourishing existence to this cause it would\r\nbe intelligible why species whose scanty number of individuals reveals a\r\nless protected condition, should be disguised in their dress, and thus\r\nshare their immunity. Is it not probable, seeing the excessive abundance\r\nof the one species and the fewness of individuals of the other, that the\r\n_Heliconea_ is free from the persecution to which the _Leptalis_ is\r\nsubjected?”[107]\r\n\r\nNo sooner was this suggestion made than naturalists all over the world\r\nbegan to test it, or rather to say that it ought to be tested. Some\r\nexperiments have been made, but they have not been very numerous, and it\r\ncan hardly be said that they entirely support Bates’s view. Sometimes\r\nthey do and sometimes they do not, so as there is no reason to suppose\r\nthat every butterfly is relished by every kind of insect-eating\r\ncreature, this is not conclusive, till the same tests are employed in\r\nregard to butterflies that are not imitated in this way; for if the\r\nlatter have not been imitated on that account, it need not be on that\r\naccount that others have been imitated. Thus Belt says, as the result of\r\nhis observations, “The _Heliconidæ_ are distasteful to most animals; I\r\nhave seen even spiders drop them out of their webs again; and small\r\nmonkeys, which are extremely fond of insects, will not eat them, as I\r\nhave proved over and over again.”[108] He also “observed a pair of birds\r\nthat were bringing butterflies and dragon-flies to their young, and\r\nalthough the _Heliconidæ_ swarmed in the neighbourhood, and are of weak\r\nflight so as to be easily caught, the birds never brought one to their\r\nnest.”[109] This seems very good evidence of the truth of Bates’s\r\ntheory, but then, as against it, we learn from the same observer that\r\n“another spider that frequented flowers seemed to be fond of these very\r\nsame butterflies,” and as to the spiders which were seen to drop them\r\nout of their webs, they may resolve themselves into one, since farther\r\non Belt says, “A large species of spider also used to drop them out of\r\nits web when I put them into it.”[109] Then we are told that “there is,\r\nhowever, a yellow and black-banded wasp that catches them to store his\r\nnest with”; and which, having done so, “would quietly bite off its\r\nwings, roll it up into a ball, and fly off with it.”[110] Professor\r\nPoulton calls these cases “interesting exceptions,” and easily accounts\r\nfor them. But might not further observation keep adding to the number of\r\nexceptions, until at last, they become so numerous that all one could\r\nsay would be this: “There is a great choice of insects in tropical\r\nAmerica, and some creatures may prefer one kind and some another, to\r\nwhatever species they belong.” In India, again, where there is another\r\nfamily of butterflies having doubles, or understudies, only one species\r\nwas refused by all the mantids which a French naturalist gave them to.\r\nOthers were eaten by all of them.\r\n\r\nHas any man tried eating one of these butterflies? That was what\r\nProfessor Wheeler did to test another supposed case of the same sort.\r\nHere the insect was a large and very conspicuously coloured day-flying\r\nmoth. This moth has not an understudy, as far as is known, but it was\r\nsupposed, then, to be an example of what is called “warning coloration,”\r\nthat is to say, its bright colours were believed to be flourished in the\r\nface of any and every animal it might meet with, in order to warn them\r\nthat it was not good to eat. Otherwise some bird, or lizard, or other\r\ncreature might kill it before it had time to find out that it wasn’t.\r\nFor instance, had it been just a brown moth—there are so many of these\r\nand most of them good to eat—how was it to be distinguished from others?\r\nBut such a get-up as _that_—black and white wings and a black and orange\r\nbody—once seen it was not to be forgotten. It was like the red flag at a\r\nrifle range, warning one off, and this is the theory of warning\r\ncoloration. So Professor Wheeler, as he rode through the deserts of\r\nWyoming, with the moths all about him, resolved to test this theory\r\nwhich had lived for a long time, and still goes on living a good deal on\r\ntrust. “He dismounted from his horse and proceeded to masticate the body\r\nof one of the moths. To his astonishment the little flavour that it\r\ncontained was mild and pleasant, one may almost say nut-like.”[111]\r\nPerhaps it may be thought that, on the “_de gustibus_” principle, what\r\nis pleasant to a human being might be disagreeable to a bird or a\r\nlizard; but Professor Wheeler tried another experiment. “Another\r\nday-flying moth, common in our eastern States, has deep black wings,\r\neach adorned with a pair of large yellow spots, and there is a dash of\r\norange on its legs. It certainly cannot be a mimetic species (if it\r\nwere, of course, one would not expect it to be nasty) as there is no\r\nother day-flying moth which could serve as its model. Several of these\r\nmoths were given to some lizards that had previously been well fed on\r\nhouse-flies and could not, therefore, be very hungry. The moths were\r\nseized at once, and devoured, with evident signs of relish.”[111]\r\n\r\nAs a result of these experiments Professor Wheeler concludes that\r\n“naturalists should be more careful in imputing nauseous or disagreeable\r\nqualities to some conspicuously coloured animals,” and he suggests that\r\n“if every field entomologist could only bring himself to repeat the\r\nwriter’s experiment on one of many cases of ‘flaunted nauseousness’ and\r\nplace his taste impressions on record, we should in the course of time\r\nhave a really valuable body of evidence, for we can hardly assume that\r\nbeasts, birds, and reptiles can find things ‘nauseous’ which are quite\r\ntasteless, or even pleasant, to the human palate.”[111] “_Il n’y a pas\r\nde réplique à cela_,” and how it is that so simple a plan did not occur\r\nto Mr. Bates during all the eleven years he was on the Amazon it is not\r\nvery easy to imagine. On the whole, perhaps, it may be said that the\r\nreason why certain butterflies are imitated by other butterflies has not\r\nbeen so satisfactorily settled as the fact that they are so imitated.\r\nBut, on the other hand, there is some—perhaps much—evidence of the truth\r\nof Bates’s theory, and, moreover, that theory is in itself so plausible\r\nthat it seems to require a good deal of evidence to overthrow it.\r\n\r\nIt is not only in South America that butterflies dress up like one\r\nanother. Instances similar to those here given occur also in Africa and\r\nthe Malay Archipelago, as well as in other parts of the world. There is\r\neven one doubtful case in England, both the copy and original being\r\nmoths. Moths, especially the day-flying ones, are represented in these\r\nphenomena as well as butterflies, which are sometimes imitated by them.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 104:\r\n\r\n  Wallace, The Malay Archipelago, pp. 100-2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 105:\r\n\r\n  Forbes, A Naturalist’s Wanderings in the Eastern Archipelago.\r\n\r\nFootnote 106:\r\n\r\n  Trimen, Protective Resemblance and Mimicry in Animals.\r\n\r\nFootnote 107:\r\n\r\n  “Contributions to an Insect Fauna of the Amazon Valley,” in\r\n  _Transactions of the Linnean Society_, vol. 23, p. 495.\r\n\r\nFootnote 108:\r\n\r\n  Belt, The Naturalist in Nicaragua, p. 109.\r\n\r\nFootnote 109:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., pp. 316, 317.\r\n\r\nFootnote 110:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., p. 109.\r\n\r\nFootnote 111:\r\n\r\n  “Impostors among Animals,” in the _Century Magazine_, July, 1901.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sights of the forest—A butterfly bridge—Bird-winged\r\n      butterflies—“What’s in a name?”—Scientific\r\n      sensibility—Resemblance _v._ mimicry—A convenient wrong\r\n      word—Beauty in nature—Nuptial display—Strange\r\n      counter-theory—_Lucus a non lucendo_—Reasoning by\r\n      contraries—True in Topsy-turvydom—Butterfly courtship—Form\r\n      and colour—A curious suggestion—Powers of defective\r\n      eyesight.\r\n\r\nTHOUGH the principle of protective resemblance, as explained in the last\r\nchapter, will account for the colours and markings of those butterflies\r\nwhich imitate the _Heliconidæ_, it does not explain how the _Heliconidæ_\r\nthemselves came to be as they are; for in nature every mark and line and\r\nshade has a meaning, and has come into existence by virtue of some law\r\nor another. Beauty itself, independently of any _arrière pensée_, as we\r\nmay call it—remembering those flower-resembling spiders—requires to be\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nNor are the _Heliconidæ_ themselves, though gaudily dressed showy\r\nbutterflies, anything like so beautiful as many others; for instance, as\r\nthe _Morphos_, those giants of their kind, who sweep like stars through\r\nthe tropical forests on wings whose whole broad surface is blue, but a\r\nblue that flashes like a drawn sword and has a hundred glints and\r\ngleamings of ever-varying light. High-fliers they are for the most part,\r\nkeeping to the tops of the trees, but every morning, and always at the\r\nsame time, they make a descent into the glades and alleys of the forest,\r\nwhere for a little they flap lazily backwards and forwards, now in\r\neclipse, now flashing forth into sunlight, as though to flaunt their\r\nbeauties in the face of the lower world. Such openings in the primeval\r\nforest are often made by the fall of great trees—for even where the axe\r\nis not there is death in the midst of life—and as these majestic insects\r\nsail high above them in a world of air and light, their shadows fall\r\nupon the place beneath, and trace their course along the ground. When\r\nthe sun’s rays strike into them, such clearings become the gathering\r\ngrounds of various butterflies. Besides the great _Morphos_, the\r\nflashing of whose wings in the sunlight can be seen sometimes a quarter\r\nof a mile away,[112] various species of _Heliconeas_—the one we have\r\njust been reading about—whose black wings are in some species spotted\r\nwith scarlet, in others with white or blue, waltz about the bushes or\r\nundergrowth, “dancing in the chequered shade”; fritillaries somewhat\r\nlike our own, but of larger size and more effective colouring, fly\r\nhigher up, about the tree-trunks, whilst over the ground itself,\r\ncarpeted as it often is with flowers fallen from the leafy world above,\r\nand scenting the air, ghost-like butterflies, whose clear, transparent\r\nwings are without any colouring matter, ceaselessly hover and flit.\r\n\r\nWherever there is a river, many-coloured armies, bivouacked amidst its\r\nvarious shoals and reefs, sit sucking water through, the moist particles\r\nof the sand, whilst others, in even greater numbers, pass and repass\r\nfrom one bank to another, making, however wide the waterway, an aerial\r\nfluttering bridge. Other butterflies, also denizens of the great\r\nBrazilian or Central American forests, have broad white wings, shot with\r\na satiny lustre, whilst those of yet another are like glass, with one\r\nopaque spot of violet and blue, in the midst of each of them. In flight\r\nthis spot is the only part that can be seen, and it looks, Bates tells\r\nus, “like the wandering petal of a flower.”[113] There are\r\nswallow-tailed butterflies, too, whose livery of deep, soft green, and\r\ndeeper velvet black, set off with roseate hues, is amongst the richest\r\nof all—“rich, not gaudy,” so at least I should term it, for I have seen\r\nit, putting flowers to shame, on the lower slopes of the Himalayas. Here\r\nthese butterflies—double the size of our _Machaon_, and of another\r\nshape, with racquet-rather than swallow-tails, flew on the open\r\nhillside, courting the sun, but in Brazil they keep to the forest\r\ndepths, where, like Una, they “make a sunshine in the shady place.”\r\n\r\nThe butterflies of South America are almost rivalled—quite they cannot\r\nbe—by those of the Malay Archipelago. Here we have the great Bird-winged\r\nButterfly, discovered by Dr. Wallace, who calls it “elegant,” and\r\nbestows upon it a name (_Ornithoptera Brookeana_) which is not quite\r\nthat.[114] However, “What’s in a name? That which we call a\r\n_Brookeana_,” etc.—we must reverse the proposition. There is no\r\ndescribing such a creature—at least, not convincingly. Suffice it to say\r\nthat its wings “almost resemble those of a sphinx moth in shape,” and\r\nare deep, velvety black, but lit up with a band of green feather-like\r\nmarkings, so brilliant and lovely that they reminded its discoverer “of\r\nthe wing-coverts of the Mexican trogon laid upon velvet”[114]—and that\r\nfor anyone who has seen a trogon, even stuffed and dried, is to say\r\nenough. Besides this adornment the great _Brookeana_ has “a broad\r\nneck-collar of vivid crimson and a few delicate white touches on the\r\nouter margins of the hind wings.”[114] Another _Ornithoptera_ without\r\nthe _Brookeana_ is “the largest, the most perfect, and the most\r\nbeautiful of butterflies.” The two last, however, are matter of opinion,\r\nand I should think myself that a _Morpho_ with its azure wings,\r\nsometimes seven inches across, and flashing a quarter of a mile away,\r\nwould run—or fly—it hard. Then there is a yet more gorgeous species of\r\n“Bird-winged Butterfly,” with wings equalling or even exceeding the\r\n_Morpho’s_ in expanse, whose ample surface is divided between flame-like\r\norange and a black so deep, rich, and velvety that it seems to glow—“the\r\npride of the Eastern tropics, one of the most gorgeously coloured\r\nbutterflies in the world.”[115]\r\n\r\nThis was the butterfly that gave Dr. Wallace a headache, “so great was\r\nthe excitement produced by what will appear to most people a very\r\ninadequate cause.”[115] Surely not; for the cause here alluded to was\r\nnot the insect’s beauty—which had been seen before, free and\r\nuntrammelled, without any such ill-consequence—but its capture and\r\nanticipated transference to the cyanide bottle. It was not mere æsthetic\r\nemotion, therefore, that produced the headache, but scientific\r\nenthusiasm, of which no man need feel ashamed. It is easy for us on such\r\noccasions to mistake our feelings, but the clue to them, I think, is\r\nthis, that however beautiful a creature may be, and however appreciative\r\nwe may think ourselves of such beauty, yet if we resolve, in the true\r\ninterests of science, to take that creature’s life, then the scientific\r\nspirit must be far stronger in us than mere admiration of its beauty.\r\nThis test I would apply to another account which Dr. Wallace gives us of\r\nthe capture of “one of the most magnificent insects that the world\r\ncontains.” “I trembled,” he says, “with excitement as I saw it coming\r\nmajestically towards me, and could hardly believe I had really succeeded\r\nin my stroke till I had taken it out of the net and was gazing, lost in\r\nadmiration, at the velvet black and brilliant green of its wings—seven\r\ninches across—its golden body, and crimson breast. It is true I had seen\r\nsimilar insects in cabinets at home, but it is quite another thing to\r\ncapture such oneself—to feel it struggling between one’s fingers, and to\r\ngaze upon its fresh and living beauty, a bright gem shining out amid the\r\nsilent gloom of a dark and tangled forest. The village of Dobbo held\r\nthat evening at least one contented man.”[116] When we consider that the\r\n“fresh and living beauty” was caught for the very sake of being made\r\ndead and mouldy, and that the “bright gem” which would otherwise have\r\ncontinued to flash in the forest was about to become one of those very\r\nsame specimens that had been looked at with such an inferior degree of\r\ninterest, we must admit, I think, that the higher of two passions was\r\npredominant here, and that the author, in dwelling only upon the other\r\nand lower one—mere delight of the eye—has done himself less than\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nMr. Bates, without headaches, has given us some very pleasing pictures\r\nof butterfly-life in the tropics, and in doing so he has instinctively,\r\nas it were, kept the killing and capturing in the background. “The\r\nnumber and variety of gaily-tinted butterflies,” he tells us, “sporting\r\nabout in this grove on sunny days, were so great that the bright moving\r\nflakes of colour gave quite a character to the physiognomy of the place.\r\nIt was impossible to walk far without disturbing flocks of them from the\r\ndamp sand at the edge of the water, where they congregate to imbibe the\r\nmoisture. They were of almost all colours, sizes, and shapes. I noticed\r\nhere altogether eighty species belonging to twenty-two different genera.\r\nIt is a singular fact that, with very few exceptions, all the\r\nindividuals of these various species thus sporting in sunny places were\r\nof the male sex; their partners, which are much more soberly dressed and\r\nimmensely less numerous than the males, being confined to the shades of\r\nthe woods. Every afternoon, as the sun was getting low, I used to notice\r\nthese gaudy, sunshine-loving swains trooping off to the forest, where I\r\nsuppose they would find their sweethearts and wives.”[117] What a\r\ndelightful scene! Here, “next to the very common sulphur-yellow and\r\norange-coloured kinds, the most abundant were about a dozen species of\r\n_Eunica_, of large size, conspicuous from their liveries of glossy dark\r\nblue and purple. A superbly adorned creature, the _Callithea Markii_,\r\nhaving wings of a thick texture, coloured sapphire blue and orange, was\r\nonly an occasional visitor. On certain days, when the weather was very\r\ncalm, two small gilded green species literally swarmed on the sands,\r\ntheir glittering wings lying wide open on the flat surface.”[117]\r\n\r\nSuch, then, are the colours of butterflies, and, as may be imagined,\r\ncomparatively few of these gorgeous liveries have been acquired through\r\nthe principle of protective resemblance—using the term in its widest\r\nsense, to include those cases where one species becomes, as it were, the\r\ndouble or wraith of another. Mimicry is the word which, by a ludicrous\r\nprocess of false reasoning, naturalists have convinced themselves it is\r\nright to apply to this particular kind of resemblance, and no other one;\r\nthough why a butterfly should _mimic_ another butterfly and only\r\n_resemble_ a leaf, “_quien sabe?_” as the Spaniards say. The principal\r\nreason adduced for this misuse of language, viz. that the wrong word is\r\nmore convenient than any right one, providing us with the useful series,\r\n_mimic_, _mimicry_, _mimetic_, _mimicker_, _mimicked_, _mimicking_,\r\nobviously applies to the one case as well as the other, and if it is an\r\nadvantage to be absurd in one way, surely it is a double one to be\r\nabsurd in two. On these grounds I would suggest to naturalists that,\r\nhaving broken down the proper and natural confinements of the word in\r\nquestion, they should rather extend its use than limit it, to the extent\r\neven of calling their children “mimetic forms,” should they happen to\r\nresemble them, and thinking twice before punishing a son for merely\r\n“mimicking” his father.\r\n\r\nBut, leaving this, how—to take the jargon as one finds it—are the\r\nglorious colours of butterflies to be explained when they are due\r\nneither to protective resemblance, which is not mimicry, though it very\r\nmuch resembles it, nor to mimicry, which is distinct from protective\r\nresemblance, though mimicking it exactly? Certainly neither of these\r\nwill do to account for uncopied hues and patterns, which are like\r\nnothing in the world but their own loveliness, unless, indeed, it be the\r\nrival glories of the most resplendent birds. Still less will aggressive\r\nresemblance—though, as we see, it can make spiders look like\r\nflowers—explain them. The great governing cause which produces such\r\neffects as these, as well as most others in nature, is natural\r\nselection; but we must look beyond natural selection even, if we wish to\r\nunderstand all the beauty that we see in the animal world, and\r\nespecially the higher developments of it.\r\n\r\nDarwin, as we know, was the great demonstrator—though not the first\r\nconceiver—of the law of natural selection,[118] and on this he might\r\nhave cried “_Nunc dimittis_” and retired, so to speak, leaving someone\r\nelse to find out the other law; but instead of that he went on and\r\ndemonstrated that too. This other law, the evidence for which is really\r\noverwhelming, and has never been met by anything better than a conceited\r\nover-estimation of human superiority, wrapped up in a cloud of wrong\r\nreasoning, is that of sexual selection, which implies that, in the\r\nchoice of their mates, animals, like ourselves, are guided by some sort\r\nof preference; and as this with them—again like ourselves—is usually\r\ndetermined by the element of beauty, the most beautiful partners are\r\nbeing constantly selected, and species in consequence become more and\r\nmore beautiful. This process, however, is usually confined to the males,\r\nthey being the eager wooers, whilst the females only wait to be courted,\r\nand then shyly and modestly choose—such, at least, is the supposition.\r\nThis masculine beauty is often inherited by that sex only to which it is\r\nso useful, but in other cases it is transmitted to the female also.\r\nThus, to take birds, where the results of the law of sexual selection\r\nare on the whole most pronounced, we have, on the one hand, the\r\npheasants and birds of paradise, where the male alone is resplendent,\r\nwhilst in the trogons, parrots, and many other species the beauty is\r\ncommon to both the sexes. As is well known, the males of various highly\r\nornate birds are accustomed to make the most extraordinary display of\r\ntheir beauty before the females, making the most of the parts most\r\nrichly decorated, assuming just such attitudes as are required in order\r\nto give these their full advantage, and, in fact, taking pains and\r\ntrouble in a high degree and of a very special and peculiar kind, which\r\nmust either be directed to an end which seems perfectly plain and\r\napparent, or else so much waste of time—due to no special cause and\r\nwithout any particular meaning—an alternative which the opponents of\r\nsexual selection do not in the least mind accepting.\r\n\r\nTo give one instance of what is called nuptial display in birds—for it\r\nwill serve to illustrate what Darwin supposes to take place with some\r\ninsects also, as well as forming a basis of comparison with what has\r\nbeen more carefully observed in the case of spiders—Belt in his often\r\nquoted work gives us the following pretty picture of humming-bird\r\ncourtship. Speaking of a beautiful blue, green, and white species\r\n(_Florisuga mellivora_), he says: “I have seen the female sitting\r\nquietly on a branch, and two males displaying their charms in front of\r\nher. One would shoot up like a rocket, then suddenly expanding the\r\nsnow-white tail like an inverted parachute, slowly descend in front of\r\nher, turning round gradually to show off both back and front. The effect\r\nwas heightened by the wings being invisible from a distance of a few\r\nyards, both from their great velocity of movement and from not having\r\nthe metallic lustre of the rest of the body. The expanded white tail\r\ncovered more space than all the rest of the bird, and was evidently the\r\ngrand feature in the performance. Whilst one was descending, the other\r\nwould shoot up and come slowly down expanded. The entertainment would\r\nend in a fight between the two performers; but whether the most\r\nbeautiful or the most pugnacious was the accepted suitor I know\r\nnot.”[119]\r\n\r\nHere the display, as well as the intention, seems evident enough, and it\r\nis not a whit more so than in hundreds of other cases collected by\r\nDarwin during his lifetime, and which have been largely added to since\r\nhis death. As the hen is constantly present during these performances,\r\nand as she has been known on various occasions to show a strong\r\npartiality, or the reverse, to this or that male bird, we have here a\r\nsolid basis of observed fact on which to raise an hypothesis. On what\r\nfacts the counter one rests, as propounded by Dr. Wallace, viz. that\r\ncolour and antics are produced by superior vigour resident in the male,\r\nit is less easy to see, unless, indeed, such as point in a quite\r\nopposite direction may, on a sort of _lucus a non lucendo_ principle, be\r\nheld to support it. If this be conceded, then, indeed, we have a\r\nplentiful crop, nor need we any longer feel sceptical because the eagle,\r\nsay—that bird of fierce energy—does not flash out like all the crown\r\njewels together as it descends on its prey, or because the swift, whose\r\nvital force is, perhaps, even greater, leaves no train of jewelled light\r\nto die all day, behind it, on the air. Nor need we wonder that the\r\ntrogons, though as resplendent as the swifts, swallows[120] and eagles\r\nare dull-coloured, should be as lazy and sluggish as these are\r\nenergetic: nor that, whereas the females of some humming-birds are\r\nsober-suited, those of others, though their vigour would seem to be in\r\nno way superior, are as gem-like as their mates: or that the males as\r\nwell as the females of some wholly dull-coloured ones, and of many other\r\nplain birds, seem bursting with vigour, and indulge in all sorts of\r\nstrange antics and dances: that a cock partridge, for instance, seems as\r\nvigorous as a cock pheasant, and that bright colours and pugnacity are\r\ndissociated in such tremendous fighters as the ruff, the coot, and the\r\nblackcock. Multiply such instances by the score or the hundred—as can\r\neasily be done—and if only the above-stated principle be granted, we get\r\nmore and more proof of the correctness of a theory to which facts, if\r\ndealt with in the more usual way, would be almost instantly fatal. After\r\nall, this would be a more satisfactory mode of procedure than that of\r\ntolerating a travesty on the strength of a high reputation. There is\r\nsuch a principle in nature as the _lucus a non lucendo_ one, so, as we\r\nadmit the word mimicry in a false sense—because it is convenient—why not\r\nadmit that? It would be not one whit less convenient—for the theory.\r\n\r\nBut, handling facts in another way, can we explain the beautiful colours\r\nof butterflies as we explain the brilliant plumage of birds—by sexual\r\nselection, that is to say? Of this there is not so much direct evidence\r\nas could be wished, for butterfly courtship is a long affair, and, for\r\nvarious reasons, is not so easy to watch under natural conditions, as in\r\nthe case of birds, though this, too, is often beset with difficulties.\r\nWe know, however, that the male is often much more beautiful than the\r\nfemale, that he pirouettes around her, and that she remains often “icy\r\ninsensible”—in fact refuses him—which certainly implies a power of\r\nchoice. Rival males, too, will “whirl round each other with the greatest\r\nrapidity, and appear to be incited by the greatest ferocity.”[121] That\r\nbutterflies, like bees, perceive and are attracted by colours is well\r\nknown, and it would be strange, indeed, if they were not alive to the\r\nmany very beautiful and complex patterns on their own wings, when these\r\ncannot have been evolved through any principle of protection—since they\r\nresemble or suggest nothing—when, in fact, if not beauty, it is\r\ndifficult to see the object aimed at. Yet the strange suggestion has\r\nbeen made that, though butterflies see colours, they cannot see form,\r\nthat their sight is defective in some peculiar kind of way. But if form\r\nis outline—and if not, what is it?—where is the distinction, seeing that\r\nthe beginning and leaving off of a colour or of two or more colours must\r\nmake an outline, and therefore a form? If we see the colours of a\r\npattern where the one ends and the other begins, we see that pattern,\r\nand on the other hand, if we could not distinguish one colour from\r\nanother, or colour from something uncoloured—as, say, the air—we should\r\nbe blind to colour, as well as to form. Form can hardly be called a\r\nthing of itself. It is rather the line of demarcation between two or\r\nmore things, so that, if each of these is clearly perceived, the form or\r\noutline which their juxtaposition makes must be also perceived. Assuming\r\nthat butterflies see the beautiful arrangements of colour—eyes, spots,\r\nbands, lines, etc.—in such a way as can alone account for their being\r\nthere to see—as well as we do, that is to say—then it is absurd to\r\nimagine that they have no perception of form.\r\n\r\nOn what is this assertion based? Mr. Scudder relies on the following\r\nfacts: “Christy,” he tells us, “observed in Manitoba one of the\r\nswallow-tails fluttering over the bushes, evidently in search of\r\nflowers. As he watched it, it settled momentarily, and exactly as if it\r\nhad mistaken it for a yellow flower, on a twig of _Betula glandulosa_,\r\nbearing withered leaves of a bright yellow colour.”[122] But might not\r\nthe association of ideas raised by a familiar colour in an insect’s mind\r\noverpower for a moment its judgment? Might it not do so in the case of a\r\nman also? And should we think a person very stupid who, for a moment,\r\nmistaking a yellow leaf for a yellow flower, stretched out his hand to\r\npick it? Pooh! once again,[123] let us think of people who do foolish\r\nthings—kings, generals, cabinet ministers, servant-maids, etc.—not of\r\ninfallible persons. We should not be too severe—not “break a butterfly\r\non a wheel.”\r\n\r\nAgain—this is Mr. Scudder’s second instance: “Albert Müller records\r\nseeing the blue Alexis of Europe fly towards a very small bit of pale\r\nblue paper lying upon the grass, and stop within an inch or two of it,\r\nas if to settle, doubtless mistaking it for another of its own\r\nkind.”[124] Surely this is rather in favour of the butterfly’s sight\r\nthan otherwise, since it discovered its mistake and did not settle. Who,\r\ntoo, can tell the precise moment at which the mistake was discovered,\r\nsince the piece of blue paper might have puzzled the butterfly—piqued\r\nits curiosity to know what it was—even after it knew what it was not?\r\nThirdly, “Plateau has observed the small tortoise-shell butterfly fly\r\nrapidly towards a cluster of artificial flowers.”[124] And who cannot be\r\ntaken in by artificial flowers? “Such examples as these,” says Mr.\r\nScudder, “seem to indicate that butterflies may perceive colour in mass,\r\nbut in no case indicate any further visual powers.”[124] To me they\r\nindicate that butterflies can make mistakes. Mistakes rarely show one’s\r\nperfections, but other indications of further visual powers are not\r\nwanting. For instance, Mr. Scudder himself says: “One of my favourite\r\nmodes of showing this characteristic (inquisitiveness) to unbelieving\r\nfriends has been to toss my cap high in the air, when these butterflies\r\nwill often dart, dash at, and play around it as it begins again to\r\ndescend.”[124] How do they play around this moving object in the air if\r\nit represents to them only “colour in mass,” and not a defined shape and\r\noutline? Were it otherwise, they would fly right into it, and be carried\r\ndown with it sometimes on top of them. But if they see all parts of the\r\ncolour so that they can nicely avoid it, and sport about its periphery,\r\nthen they see the shape of the cap. Then, again, Mr. Scudder tells us:\r\n“Many kinds are of a lively and even pugnacious disposition, and perch\r\nthemselves upon the tip of a twig, or on a stone, or some such outlook,\r\nand dash at the first butterfly that passes, _especially if it be one of\r\ntheir own species_;[125] then the two advance and retreat, forwards and\r\nbackwards, time and again, circle round each other with amazing\r\ncelerity, all the while, perchance, mounting skywards, until suddenly\r\nthey part, dash to the ground, and the now quiet pursuer again stations\r\nhimself on the very spot he quitted for the fray.”[126] How does he do\r\n_that_ without accurate eyesight, with good defining power?—to which,\r\nindeed, the whole performance bears witness. Elsewhere, too, this\r\npronounced characteristic of returning to the exact spot, left some\r\nlittle time ago, is dwelt upon. To me it seems a complete upsettal of\r\nthe defective eyesight theory, or, since good eyesight could do no more,\r\nwhat does such defectiveness matter?\r\n\r\nThe following description also, which Bates gives us, of butterfly-life\r\nby the Amazons, does not suggest that any of these bright-day-lovers,\r\nthese children of the sun, need write an “_Apologia pro oculis suis_.”\r\n“The fine showy _Heliconii_,” he says, “often assemble in small parties,\r\nor by twos and threes, apparently to sport together or perform a kind of\r\ndance” (my “dancing in the chequered shade,” therefore, was no inapt\r\nquotation). “I believe the parties are composed chiefly of males. The\r\nsport begins generally between a single pair. They advance, retire,\r\nglide right and left in face of each other, wheel round to a\r\nconsiderable distance, again approach, and so on; a third joins in, then\r\na fourth, or more. _They never touch_;[127] when too many are\r\ncongregated a general flutter takes place, and they all fly off, to fall\r\nin again by pairs shortly afterwards.”[128] Lastly, Belt tells us this:\r\n“Here a large spider built strong, yellow, silken webs joined one on to\r\nthe other, so as to make a complete curtain of web, in which were\r\nentangled many large butterflies, generally forest species, caught when\r\nflying across the clearing. I was at first surprised to find that the\r\nkinds that frequent open places were not caught, although they abounded\r\non low white-flowered shrubs close to the webs; but on getting behind\r\nthem and trying to frighten them within the silken curtain, their\r\ninstinct taught them to avoid it, for, although startled, they threaded\r\ntheir way through open spaces and between the webs with the greatest\r\nease.”[129] If a butterfly with defective eyesight can thread its way\r\nbetween spiders’ webs, so as never to be caught, “with the greatest\r\nease,” “why, then, say an old man can do somewhat”—but it must be\r\nwithout spectacles.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 112:\r\n\r\n  Bates, The Naturalist on the River Amazon.\r\n\r\nFootnote 113:\r\n\r\n  Ibid.

Rather they are a synonym of\r\nsomething uncouth and horrid-looking, as well as of skill and\r\npersevering industry. For those of us, however, who have lived in the\r\ntropics they have other associations, for here, side by side with the\r\nmost hideous of monsters, huge, dark, and hairy, are found others, small\r\nand gem-like, flashing indeed with beauty, the representatives in their\r\norder of the humming-birds, those “living sunbeams” of the Indians,\r\namongst birds. These lovely little spiders belong to a particular\r\nfamily, the _Attidæ_, which has been placed by common consent at the\r\nhead of all the others, since, whilst structurally, and in other\r\nrespects, it is inferior to none, “it contains among its 1,500 species\r\nthe greatest amount of sexual differentiation and the highest\r\ndevelopment of ornamentation.” Dr. Wallace, after noticing “their\r\nimmense numbers, variety, and beauty,” in tropical South America, says,\r\n“Many of them are so exquisitely coloured as to resemble jewels rather\r\nthan spiders”;[130] and again, in his work on the Malay Archipelago, he\r\nalludes to them as “perfect gems of beauty.”[131]\r\n\r\nThese little radiant spiders live amongst flowers and foliage, and here\r\nthey chase such small insects as their size allows them to cope with.\r\nBesides running, they make little leaps into the air, and so, if they\r\ncan manage it, come down on their prey, for which reason they are often\r\ncalled “jumping spiders.” This is a very different mode of action from\r\nthat of remaining perfectly still till a butterfly or other insect\r\nhappens to settle on one, and it is accordingly instructive to find\r\nthat, great as is the beauty of these flower-haunting spiders, yet it\r\ndoes not resemble that of the flowers amongst which it is displayed. The\r\niridescent flashes and sparkles more resemble those of the mineral than\r\nof the vegetable world—where, indeed, they hardly exist—and must serve,\r\nas well as their active movements, to point them out to their enemies\r\neven amidst a background of flowers. It is not upon principles of\r\nprotection, therefore, or to acquire a dissembling resemblance that such\r\nbright brilliancy has been developed in these little creatures.\r\n\r\nSince, therefore, these spiders could not have become beautiful on any\r\nprinciple of protective or aggressive resemblance, nor yet of warning\r\ncoloration, for which there would here be no opening, and had yet become\r\nbeautiful in a high degree, they seemed to Professor and Mrs. Peckham to\r\noffer a good subject for the testing of the theory of sexual selection,\r\nand deciding as to whether Darwin or Wallace was right in that matter.\r\nAfter several months of careful, and often very laborious\r\nobservation—rewarded, however, by the most interesting results—they have\r\ngiven their answer, and this answer, resting as it does on the most\r\nirrefragable evidence, should be decisive for all time. It may safely be\r\nasserted that anyone who, after reading the “Peckham paper,” as it may\r\nwell be called, is not convinced both that the male spiders of this\r\nbeautiful family woo the females by displaying their beauty before them,\r\nand that the females carefully watch the display, accepting only such as\r\nplease them sufficiently and rejecting the others, never will be\r\nconvinced, since only by the spiders actually speaking, which is not\r\nlikely to happen, could the evidence be bettered. If, indeed, the female\r\nhad been heard to say “Pretty i’ faith,” or “You are a fine young man,”\r\njust before her actions gave clear, or still clearer indication that\r\nthis was in her mind, had she murmured “Take me” as she let herself be\r\ntaken, and had the male asked, after the way common in novels, “Was it\r\nmy abdomen or the stripes on my palpi that made you first fall in love\r\nwith me?” then, perhaps, even those who believe that the higher\r\nspiritual love is for man alone would have been converted—and yet I know\r\nnot, since assertions so unlikely in themselves might have flung doubt\r\non the whole paper.\r\n\r\nBut, however this may be, the evidence now offered us in favour of\r\nDarwin’s views can never be strengthened except in this way, so that, as\r\nfar as proof is possible in such a matter, sexual selection as a law and\r\nprincipal agent of beauty in nature is now proved, though, at the same\r\ntime, several more facts are added to those upon which the counter\r\nhypothesis seems based, and which would certainly prove it in\r\nTopsy-turvydom. To take these first, the authors of the paper in\r\nquestion have sought to apply to spiders “the hypothesis that the\r\nbrighter colour of the male is due to his greater activity and vital\r\nforce.” “Beginning,” they say, “with the most brilliant family—the\r\n_Attidæ_—we find that the females are, with few exceptions, larger,\r\nstronger, and more pugnacious than the males. Thus we placed two females\r\nof _Phidippus morsitans_ together in a glass jar. No sooner did they\r\nobserve each other than both prepared for battle. Eyeing each other with\r\na firm glance, they slowly advanced, and in a moment were locked in\r\ndeadly combat. Within a few seconds the cephalothorax of one was pierced\r\nby the fang of the other, and with a convulsive tremor it relaxed its\r\nhold and fell dead. We placed together eight pairs in all, and in each\r\ninstance the fight was short and even to the death. Subsequently we put\r\nin a well-developed male, which, though smaller, was compactly built and\r\napparently strong enough to bring the virago to terms, but to our\r\nsurprise he seemed alarmed and retreated, trying to avoid her. She,\r\nhowever, followed him up and finally killed him.”[132]\r\n\r\nSo much for _Phidippus morsitans_. Coming to _Dendryphantes elegans_,\r\nthe authors, who kept a number together in a large box, “were much\r\nstruck by the greater quarrelsomeness of the females. They would\r\nfrequently go out of their way to chase each other, and they were much\r\nmore circumspect in approaching each other than were the males.”[133]\r\nAgain they say, “Valkenaer, Menge, Hentz, and others give numerous\r\ninstances where the male meets his death through the fierceness of his\r\nmate. In fact the danger is so imminent that after a successful\r\ncourtship it is the habit in several genera (e.g. _Epeira_ and\r\n_Tegnaria_) for the male to retire with precipitation from the web of\r\nthe female as a reasonable precaution; yet the rule is for the male to\r\nbe more ‘beautified’ than the female.”[133]\r\n\r\nComing now to the actual courtship of these brilliant spiders, the\r\nauthors placed pairs of several species in square wooden boxes, having a\r\ncloth bottom, on which they could easily move about. One of the species\r\nexperimented on was _Dendryphantes elegans_ mentioned only a moment\r\nago—such a name is not to be forgotten—whose beauty is thus described:\r\n“The male is covered with iridescent scales, his general colour being\r\ngreen. In the female the colouring is dark but iridescent, and in\r\ncertain lights has lovely rosy tints. In the sunlight both shine with\r\nthe metallic splendour of humming-birds. The male alone has a\r\nsuperciliary fringe of hairs on either side of his head, his first legs\r\nbeing also larger and more adorned than those of his mate.”[133]\r\n\r\nYet the extra vigour from which this special growth is supposed to have\r\nsprung has not, as we shall see, affected his growth in general. “The\r\nfemale is much larger, and her loveliness is accompanied by an extreme\r\nirritability of temper, which the male seems to regard as a constant\r\nmenace to his safety; but his eagerness being great and his manner\r\ndevoted and tender, he gradually overcomes her opposition. Her change of\r\nmood is only brought about after much patient courting on his\r\npart”.[133] And now comes the minutely interesting description of this\r\niridescent, _couleur de rose_ courtship. “While from three to five\r\ninches distant from her he begins to wave his plumy legs in a way that\r\nreminds one of a windmill. She eyes him fiercely, and he keeps at the\r\nproper distance for a long time. If he comes close she dashes at him and\r\nhe quickly retreats. Sometimes he becomes bolder, and when within an\r\ninch pauses with the first legs outstretched before him, not raised, as\r\nis common in other species; the palpi also (in insects it would be the\r\nantennæ) are held stiffly out in front, with the points together. Again\r\nshe drives him off, and so the play continues. Now the male grows\r\nexcited, as he approaches her, and while still several inches away\r\nwhirls completely around and around; pausing, he runs closer, and begins\r\nto make his abdomen quiver as he stands on tiptoe in front of her.\r\nPrancing from side to side, he grows bolder and bolder, while she seems\r\nless fierce, and yielding to the excitement, lifts up her magnificently\r\ncoloured abdomen, holding it at one time vertically and at another\r\nsideways to him. She no longer rushes at him, but retreats a little as\r\nhe approaches. At last he comes close to her, lying flat, with his first\r\nlegs stretched out and quivering. With the tips of his front legs he\r\ngently pats her; this seems to arouse the old demon of resistance, and\r\nshe drives him back. Again and again he pats her, with a caressing\r\nmovement, gradually creeping nearer and nearer, which she now permits\r\nwithout resistance,”[133] and so on,\r\n\r\n               “Till the happy ‘yes’ falters from her mouth,”\r\n\r\nalmost as exciting, though not quite so detailed, as the climax scene of\r\na latter-day novel.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. A solitary spider dancing before its mate.]\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 2. A cockroach attacking an astonished scorpion. Its\r\nweapons are the spines on its powerful hind legs.]\r\n\r\nOf the courtship of another species—_Habrocestum splendens_—we have the\r\nfollowing account: “The male, a magnificent fellow when we first caught\r\nhim, displayed for a long time before the female. He began by advancing\r\na few inches before her, and then backing off again, this being repeated\r\nmany times. After a while he settled down under a little web in the\r\ncorner. The female, troubled by this indifferent treatment, advanced\r\ntowards him; he came out and she fell back. This play was kept up for\r\nsome time, but at length the male began his courting in earnest. When\r\nwithin a few inches of her he began a rapid dance from side to side,\r\nraising the whole body high on the tips of the legs, the first pair\r\nbeing directed forward and the palpi clasped together, with the abdomen\r\nturned to one side and lifted up. After a short dance he stood\r\nmotionless, striking an attitude and remaining quiet for half a minute.\r\nThen he turned his back on her, moving irregularly about, with his legs\r\nforward and his palpi vibrating. Again he dances sideways before her,\r\nstrutting and showing off like a peacock, or whirling around and\r\naround.”[133]\r\n\r\nOn such occasions the female would “commonly move nearer to him and\r\nappear much excited herself. We at first supposed that this turning\r\naround was accidental, but it happened so regularly at a certain stage\r\nof the courtship that we concluded it was an important part of the\r\ndisplay, serving to better show off his brilliant abdomen.”[133] Of this\r\nthere can hardly be a doubt, since on every occasion the male spider,\r\nwhatever his species, assumed such attitudes as displayed his best\r\npoints to the best advantage—a fact which recalls the following passage\r\nin one of Darwin’s letters: “I am very glad to hear of your cases of the\r\ntwo sets of _Hesperiadæ_ (a butterfly), which display their wings\r\ndifferently, according to which surface is coloured. I cannot believe\r\nthat such display is accidental or purposeless.”\r\n\r\nHow glad, and more than glad, would Darwin have been to have read the\r\ntale of these spiders! It is, indeed, one of those ironies of fate, of\r\nwhich the world is so full, that he did not live to see this\r\ndemonstration—for it is no less—of the truth of his most original and\r\nelevating views; elevating they may be well called, since they allow to\r\nthe animal world an æsthetic faculty, the power, once thought\r\nexclusively human, of appreciating beauty. It is curious how willing\r\nmany are to exalt humanity at the expense of all other beings. The\r\nhigher faculties they like, and perception of the beautiful they like,\r\nand spirituality—especially in love—they like very much indeed; but they\r\nonly like these things in their own species. That is to say, conceit\r\nlies at the bottom of all this exaltation. Such man-worshippers would\r\nnot have more of a good thing in the world, but less, so that they may\r\nhave all there is of it. On such grounds the war against evolution was\r\nwaged, and its last struggles are against sexual selection. The body has\r\nbeen given up, but the spirit, which touches us yet more nearly, is\r\nstill fiercely defended.\r\n\r\nIn _Hasarius Hoyi_ “the sexes are very different, the male being the\r\nmore conspicuous of the two. In his dances, the male has several\r\nmovements. Most commonly he goes from side to side, with his first legs\r\nobliquely up. At other times he twists the abdomen to one side, and,\r\nbending low on the other, goes first in one direction for about two\r\ninches, and then, reversing, circles to the opposite point. The females\r\nare very savage, especially with each other, and even the members of the\r\nsterner sex are not always free from danger when paying their\r\npreparatory addresses. Once we saw a female eagerly watching a prancing\r\nmale, and, as he slowly approached her, she raised her legs as if to\r\nstrike him, but he, nothing daunted by her unkindly reception of his\r\nattentions, advanced even nearer, when she seized him and seemed to hold\r\nhim by the head for a minute—he struggling. At last he freed himself and\r\nran away.”[133] Yet “this same male, after a time, courted her\r\nsuccessfully.” That so much savagery has to be overcome in the female,\r\nand finally is overcome by these dances, shows how powerfully she must\r\nbe affected by them. Of another and previously undescribed species, “a\r\ndozen or more males, and about half as many females,” were found by the\r\nauthors “assembled together” under natural conditions. “The males were\r\nrushing hither and thither, dancing opposite now one female and now\r\nanother. Often two males met each other, when a short passage of arms\r\nfollowed. The males were very quarrelsome, and had frequent fights, but\r\nwe never found that they were injured. Indeed, after having watched\r\nhundreds of seemingly terrible battles between the males of this and\r\nother species, the conclusion has been forced upon us that they are all\r\nsham affairs, gotten up for the purpose of displaying before the\r\nfemales, who commonly stand by, interested spectators.”[133]\r\n\r\nThen there is a small ant-like species, who, “unlike most of the _Attid_\r\nmales, keeps all his feet on the ground during his courtship. Raising\r\nhimself on the tips of the posterior six, he slightly inclines his head\r\ndownwards by bending his front legs, their convex surface being always\r\nturned forward. His abdomen is lifted vertically, so that it is at a\r\nright angle to the rest of his body. In this position he sways from side\r\nto side. After a moment he drops the abdomen, runs a few steps nearer\r\nthe female, and then tips his body and begins to sway again. Now he runs\r\nin one direction, now in another, pausing every few moments to rock from\r\nside to side and to bend his brilliant legs, so that she may look full\r\nat them.”[133] What can be clearer than this? And here, indeed, the\r\nauthors remark: “We were much impressed by the fact that the attitude\r\ntaken by the males served perfectly to show off their fine points to the\r\nfemale. We had never known the male of this species until the day that\r\nwe caught this one and put him into the mating-box, and it was while\r\nstudying his courtship that we noticed how he differed from the female\r\nin his iridescent first legs. He could not have chosen a better position\r\nthan the one he took to make a display.”[133]\r\n\r\nElsewhere, in another experiment with the same species, the authors,\r\nafter remarking that if these specially modified front legs were held in\r\nany other way the effect of the flattened and iridescent surface would\r\nbe lost, go on to say: “This is a good example of what we have again and\r\nagain observed in the courtship of the _Attidæ_: that whatever fine\r\npoints of colour or structure the male possesses, his actions before the\r\nfemale display them to the very best advantage. In whatever part the\r\nspecial merit may lie, he sedulously strives to bring it to the notice\r\nand impress its beauty upon the mind of the female to whom he is paying\r\nhis addresses.”[133] As for the female, she is throughout described as\r\nwatching the male eagerly and with the greatest interest, and that this\r\ninterest is not always felt from the first, but is aroused by degrees,\r\nbecoming, at last, so strong as to suspend for a time the natural\r\ninclination to assault and eat the wooer, is all the more significant.\r\nThat there are dangers in these courtships there has been some\r\nindication, “but worse remains behind.” _Phidippus rufus_ was caught\r\nonce and eaten in an unguarded moment, and whilst _Phidippus morsitans_\r\nwas waving his particularly handsome first pair of legs, “thickly\r\nadorned with white hairs,” precisely the same thing happened to him.\r\nStill, on the whole, such incidents are exceptional.\r\n\r\nParticularly interesting is the account given of the courtship of\r\n_Saitis pulex_, a male of which species was introduced into a box\r\nalready occupied by a female. “He saw her as she stood perfectly still,\r\ntwelve inches away; the glance seemed to excite him, and he moved\r\ntowards her; when some four inches from her he stood still, and then\r\nbegan the most remarkable performances that an amorous male could offer\r\nto an admiring female. She eyed him eagerly, changing her position from\r\ntime to time, so that he might be always in view. He, raising his whole\r\nbody on one side, by straightening out the legs, and lowering it on the\r\nother by folding the first two pairs of legs up and under, leant so far\r\nover as to be in danger of losing his balance, which he only maintained\r\nby sidling rapidly towards the lowered side. The palpus, too, on this\r\nside, was turned back to correspond to the direction of the legs nearest\r\nit. He moved in a semicircle for about two inches, and then instantly\r\nreversed the position of the legs and circled in the opposite direction,\r\ngradually approaching nearer and nearer to the female. Now she dashes\r\ntowards him, while he, raising his first pair of legs, extends them\r\nupward and forward as if to hold her off, but withal slowly retreats.\r\nAgain and again he circles from side to side, she gazing towards him in\r\na softer mood, evidently admiring the grace of his antics. This is\r\nrepeated until we have counted one hundred and eleven circles made by\r\nthe ardent little male. Now he approaches nearer and nearer, and when\r\nalmost within reach, whirls madly around and around her, she joining and\r\nwhirling with him in a giddy maze. Again he falls back and resumes his\r\nsemicircular motions with his body tilted over; she, all excitement,\r\nlowers her head and raises her body so that it is almost vertical; both\r\ndraw nearer”[133]—and the male, now, for some short period is in no\r\ndanger of being eaten.\r\n\r\nLastly—for this must be the last example—we have a species—_Astia\r\nvittata_—in which the male is represented by two differing forms, each\r\nof which dances before the female in its own particular way. One of\r\nthese forms is red, like the female, which he resembles in other\r\nrespects, so that this must be taken as the original specific type. The\r\nother, which has evidently been developed from it, in deference to the\r\næsthetic preferences of the female, is black, with the special adornment\r\nof three tufts of hair on his head, or thereabouts, that part of a\r\nspider which is termed the cephalothorax. These tufts stick bolt\r\nupright, rising together, but separating about half-way up, and give to\r\ntheir fortunate possessor—for, as we shall see, he is fortunate—a very\r\nspruce and dapper appearance. Looked at dispassionately, if one can do\r\nthat, they are certainly as handsome as moustaches, and there is no\r\nreason in the nature of things why they should not be admired as much.\r\nSo, indeed, they are, and that the admiration bestowed upon each is of\r\nan equally high nature I, at any rate, see no reason to doubt.\r\n\r\nThe following description will show what a spider with moustaches can\r\nachieve: “The _vittata_ form, which is quite like the female, when he\r\napproaches her raises his first legs either so that they point forward\r\nor upward, keeping his palpi stiffly outstretched, while the tip of his\r\nabdomen is bent to the ground. This position he commonly takes when\r\nthree or four inches away. While he retains this attitude he keeps\r\ncurving and waving his legs in a very curious manner. Frequently he\r\nraises only one of the legs of the first pair, running all the time from\r\nside to side. As he draws nearer to the female he lowers his body to the\r\nground, and, dropping his legs also, places the two anterior pairs so\r\nthat the tips touch in front, the proximal joints being turned almost at\r\na right angle to the body. Now he glides in a semicircle before the\r\nfemale, sometimes advancing, sometimes receding, until at last she\r\naccepts his addresses. The _niger_ form, evidently a later development,\r\nis much the more lively of the two, and whenever the two varieties were\r\nseen to compete for a female the black one was successful.”[133]\r\n\r\nHere, surely, is a final answer to those assertions as to indifference\r\non the part of the female, which, though made in the teeth of\r\nprobability, are often, on account of the difficulties of observation,\r\nalmost impossible to disprove. Here are two kinds of males, one lively\r\nand with moustaches, the other not so lively and without them; as the\r\nfirst is always, or even, say, generally chosen, his appearance must be\r\npreferred. Were it only his liveliness, as Dr. Wallace has suggested,\r\nwhy should he have acquired another dress as well as another dance? or,\r\nif the female can have a choice as between liveliness and slowness, as\r\nbetween a jig and a minuet, why, in Heaven’s name, should she not have\r\none as between one get-up and another? Sexual selection might, I think,\r\nbe put to the test in this one species with its two male forms. Let but\r\na sufficient number of courtships be observed and reported on, and if\r\n_niger_, in a large percentage of them, wins the day, choice on the part\r\nof the female—the only link in the chain of evidence which it is at all\r\npossible to deny—is a proved thing.\r\n\r\nBut to continue: “He—_niger_—is bolder in his manners (no wonder he\r\nprevails), and we have never seen him assume the prone position, as the\r\nred form did, when close to the female. He always held one or both of\r\nthe first legs high in the air, waving them wildly to and fro; or when\r\nthe female became excited, he stood perfectly motionless before her,\r\nsometimes for a whole minute, seeming to fascinate her by the power of\r\nhis glance”[133]—greatly aided probably by the three tufts of hair\r\nshowing through the archway of the uplifted legs. Here, again, too, as\r\nin some of the other species—perhaps all—“although the males were\r\ncontinually waving their first legs at each other, their quarrels were\r\nharmless. It was quite otherwise with the females, since they not only\r\nkept the other sex in awe of them, but not infrequently in their battles\r\nkilled each other.”[133] As the males cannot win the females by\r\nfighting, what have they to contend with effectively except these\r\ncurious, elaborate, and most interesting displays, the purpose of which\r\nis so excessively obvious? On the other hand, the fact that the females\r\nyield, almost against their nature, to these displays, that they are\r\nslowly and gradually won through their means, is proof positive that\r\nthey like them, and if so, how is it possible that they should not like\r\none more or less than another? What, in fact, is choice but a greater or\r\nless reaction to this stimulus or to that? The initial absurdity of\r\nlaying claim to a monopoly of such a capacity as this, either in our\r\nmatrimonial affairs, or any other matter in which animals participate,\r\nhas not been sufficiently dwelt upon.\r\n\r\nProfessor Poulton, in considering this case of _Astra vittata_ with its\r\ntwo male forms, one of which is always chosen by the female in\r\npreference to the other, remarks (with his own italics), “It must be\r\nadmitted that these facts afford the _strongest support_ to the theory\r\nof Sexual Selection.”[134] He thus endorses—as anyone, I think, not\r\nhard-set the other way, must endorse—the opinion of the authors of the\r\npaper that “in the _Attidæ_ we have conclusive evidence that the females\r\npay close attention to the love dances of the males, and also that they\r\nhave not only the power, but the will, to exercise a choice among the\r\nsuitors for their favour,”[135] to which he adds this rider:\r\n“Remembering that this conclusion has only been reached in the _Attidæ_\r\nby the closest study, I think we may safely explain the smaller\r\nconfidence with which we can speak of other animals by the want of\r\nsufficiently careful and systematic investigation.”\r\n\r\nThe process of the narrative having led, in the last chapter or two, to\r\na discussion of some of the ways in which insects become shaped and\r\ncoloured through natural selection, sexual selection seemed marked out\r\nas the subject for this one. The reason why I have filled it with\r\nextracts from a certain very interesting paper has been a better one\r\nthan that of saving myself trouble. That paper—the most important one\r\nperhaps that has ever been written on the subject—is a wonderful\r\nconfirmation of Darwin’s views, but Darwin, as it appears to me, has not\r\nbenefited by it in the way that he ought to do in the popular mind.\r\nThere is no work that I know of, written upon merely popular lines, that\r\nbrings these facts forward, and yet I feel sure that to large numbers of\r\npeople, who yet do not care to read books avowedly scientific, they must\r\nbe extremely interesting, not only in themselves, but as allowing them\r\nboth to form a judgment on the subject, and on the correctness or\r\notherwise of Darwin’s views—for Darwin is an interesting and picturesque\r\nfigure far beyond the close borough of science.\r\n\r\nNow the general more intelligent public who read, perhaps, widely, but\r\nnot very deeply or very specially, know that Darwin believed in two\r\nforces—natural and sexual selection—by the joint action of which,\r\nspecies, as he held, had been gradually modified and evolved, and they\r\nknow that the former of these two has been accepted by science, but that\r\nto the latter there has been much more opposition, and that it is not—or\r\nis not supposed to be—established like the other. Many, perhaps, may\r\nhave read Dr. Wallace’s _Darwinism_, a work in which Darwin’s most\r\ndistinctive and original view—that one whose conception, apparently, he\r\nshared with nobody and on which he based much of the argument contained\r\nin his _Descent of Man_—is considered and rejected in a way which makes\r\nthe title of the book misleading, surely, if not a somewhat comically\r\nludicrous misnomer. All those who have read it, as well as many who have\r\nnot, will be interested—they cannot fail to be—in the wonderful record\r\nof spider courtships contained in these extracts, and having reflected\r\non them, they will, if I mistake not, be much more impressed with the\r\narguments _for_ this part of Darwinism than they were with those brought\r\nagainst it in the book of that name.\r\n\r\nAll these latter arguments, by the way—the languor of swallows as\r\nagainst the vitality of parrots, trogons, etc.—were well known to Darwin\r\nhimself; and as no one was, at the same time, more impartial in\r\nconsidering, and more capable of correctly estimating, facts hostile to\r\nhis own theories, or which, at first sight, might seem to be so, it may\r\nnot be out of place to end this chapter with a reference to what he\r\nthought of them. This we may gather from a statement contained in a\r\npaper—the last, presumably, ever written by him—which was read before\r\nthe Zoological Society but a few hours before his death, and which is as\r\nfollows: “I may, perhaps, be here permitted to say that, after having\r\ncarefully weighed, to the best of my ability, the various arguments\r\nwhich have been advanced against the principle of sexual selection, I\r\nremain firmly convinced of its truth.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 130:\r\n\r\n  Tropical Nature, p. 97.\r\n\r\nFootnote 131:\r\n\r\n  Malay Archipelago (1898), p. 331.\r\n\r\nFootnote 132:\r\n\r\n  Observations on Sexual Selection in Spiders.\r\n\r\nFootnote 133:\r\n\r\n  Occasional Papers of the Natural History Society of Wisconsin, vol.\r\n  i., Nos. 1, 2, and 3.\r\n\r\nFootnote 134:\r\n\r\n  The Colours of Animals.\r\n\r\nFootnote 135:\r\n\r\n  Occasional Papers of the Natural History Society of Wisconsin, vol.\r\n  i., Nos. 1, 2, and 3.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\n    Web making spiders—Dangerous wooings—An unkind\r\n      lady-love—Lizard-eating spiders—Enlightened curiosity—Rival\r\n      entomologists—Instinct of resignation—A worm-eating\r\n      spider—Alternative explanation—The dangers of\r\n      patriotism—Trap-door spiders—Web-flying spiders—Spiders that\r\n      nearly fly—Spider navigators—The raft and the diving-bell.\r\n\r\nNONE of the spiders mentioned in the last chapter are web-makers. These\r\nlatter are not dancers; that is to say, the males do not dance before\r\nthe females when they wish to recommend themselves as husbands. Instead,\r\nthey pull at the strands of the web, whilst stationed at its\r\ncircumference, in a manner which has a distinct meaning for the female,\r\nwho sits in the centre, and who replies by other twitches. These may be\r\neither of an encouraging or repellent nature, and it is only in the\r\nformer case that the lover ventures to approach. This, however, he must\r\ndo with extreme caution, and prepared at any moment to drop and hang\r\nsuspended by a thread should the object of his attentions, who greatly\r\nexceeds him in size, change her mind or conceive some cause of\r\ndispleasure against him. Should he not be sufficiently quick on such\r\noccasions, he is liable to be spun up between the long legs of his\r\nlady-love as though he were a fly, and disposed of accordingly. This was\r\nobserved in 1798 by Raymond Maria de Termayer, who remarks upon it:\r\n“Perhaps overpowering hunger compelled her to do it, but the act was\r\nvery ferocious.”\r\n\r\nThe most curious thing in these _webepathic_ courtships, as one may call\r\nthem, is that the female spider seems to know the particular jerk or\r\ntwitch of any strand of the web which is made by a male, and to\r\ndistinguish it, perfectly, from the vibrations set in motion by a fly or\r\nother insect that enters it, for upon these occasions, though her back\r\nmay be turned towards her admirer, she does not trouble to look round,\r\nwhereas in the latter case she would not only do so, but come rushing\r\ndown to secure her victim—if she were hungry, perhaps it should be\r\nadded. On the other hand, as has been already mentioned, the male can\r\ninterpret the wishes of the female from the movement she imparts to the\r\nthread, and regulates his conduct accordingly. Webepathy, therefore,\r\ndoes not seem a name ill-chosen to describe this system of\r\nintercommunication of ideas.\r\n\r\nThe spider mentioned above as devouring her lover was the common garden\r\nor geometric one, as it is sometimes called, which in England is the\r\nlargest example of a web-spinner. In other parts of the world, however,\r\nweb-spinning spiders attain to a much larger size, and their webs, of\r\ncourse, are in proportion. The largest, perhaps, are found in\r\nMadagascar, and the gigantic fabrics which many of these weave are\r\ncuriously utilised by smaller spiders of a parasitic disposition, who\r\nspin their own little webs between the thick strands of those of their\r\nhosts. Here they live in perfect amity with the latter, in whose\r\npresence they find a protection against the attacks of small birds—for\r\nthese, it would seem, stand in awe of these huge spiders, in whose toils\r\nthey are sometimes accidentally caught, and by whom they are then\r\ndevoured. So, at least, Vinson, the historian of the spiders of\r\nMadagascar, would seem to imply, if he does not actually make the\r\nstatement, of which I will not be quite sure.[136] That the great\r\n_Mygale_ of South America eats birds is now an established fact, Bates\r\nhaving given an account of it in his well-known work, _The Naturalist on\r\nthe River Amazon_.[137] In this case also the birds—for there were two\r\nof them—were caught in a web, but it was not a geometric one, in which\r\nthe spider sat, but a much denser and more closely woven fabric\r\nstretched across a crevice, or irregularity, in the trunk of a tree, the\r\nspider—which was of much larger size than the largest _Epeira_—keeping\r\nwatch behind it in the recess.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BIRD-CATCHING SPIDER’S WEB.]\r\n\r\n    This enormous Madagascar spider spins webs so strong that\r\n      birds are caught and held in them. In one of the large\r\n      meshes will be seen a small parasitic spider’s web for\r\n      catching flies and other insects. The smaller spider is not\r\n      only permitted to do this, but is protected by its host from\r\n      the attacks of the smaller birds.\r\n\r\nOther spiders—as doubtless the _Mygale_ if he can get them—will eat\r\nlizards, as the following account by Mr. Frederick Pollock will show:\r\n“Having procured from the Deserta Grande some fine specimens of this\r\nlarge and handsome spider (_Lycosa_—a kind of tarantula) in the early\r\npart of this year, and having provided suitable cages with glass lids\r\nfor them, I was anxious to ascertain how large an animal the largest\r\nspider would take; and for this purpose I obtained some lizards about\r\nthree inches long, including the tail. Three of these lizards were\r\nkilled and devoured by one spider during the time I kept it. They were\r\neaten bones and head and claws and all, the only remnant of the feast\r\nbeing a small ball about a quarter of an inch in diameter, which was\r\ncast aside at the bottom of the cage.”[138] But why were not some larger\r\nlizards tried, since there was no difficulty about three inches? Every\r\ninch would have increased the fun—I mean have added to the scientific\r\ninterest. But perhaps there were none larger.\r\n\r\nMr. Pollock goes on to say that “the islands of Madeira, Porto Santo,\r\nand Deserta Grande all lie within an area about fifty miles across. They\r\nhave each its own peculiar large _Lycosa_, no two being alike; and it is\r\na very remarkable fact that these _Lycosæ_ vary in size inversely with\r\nthe magnitude of the island on which they are found—Madeira, the largest\r\nisland, having the smallest _Lycosa_, and Deserta Grande, the smallest\r\nisland, having by far the largest spider. The mode of defence of all\r\nthese varieties of _Lycosæ_ is precisely the same. They elevate the\r\nthorax, raise the first pair of legs high up, and opening wide asunder\r\ntheir falces, strike at and seize any object, such as the end of a\r\npencil” (or the tail of a lizard) “in a most formidable manner.”[138]\r\n\r\nThere is another lizard-eating spider, or at least a spider that will\r\neat lizards when formally introduced to them, and that in a very\r\nscientifically interesting manner, the lizard showing such a lively\r\nsense of its situation, and the jaws of the spider working in a way\r\nwhich is very curious. These jaws, it appears, are double, also\r\n“cheliform,” “denticulate,” and several other things, from which I\r\ngather that there are two pairs, each pair working something like the\r\nclaws of a crab, but with a sawing action, adapted to their toothed\r\nsurface. By an extremely beautiful adjustment, when the spider in\r\nquestion seizes its prey, one pair of jaws holds on to it, whilst the\r\nother saws into it, and then the pair which has been sawing, holds, and\r\nthe pair which has been holding, saws, and so on alternately, a\r\ndivision, and yet, at the same time, a combination of labour.\r\n\r\n                 “Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,\r\n                  But yet an union in partition.”\r\n\r\nThe efficacy of the arrangement was well tested by an Anglo-Indian\r\nscientist upon a lizard three inches long, _exclusive_ this time of the\r\ntail. “The spider sprang upon it, and made a seizure immediately behind\r\nthe shoulder. The poor lizard struggled violently at first, rolling over\r\nand over in its agony, but the spider kept firm hold, and gradually\r\nsawed away with its double jaws into the very entrails of its\r\nvictim.”[139] There was an interesting variation between this case and\r\nthe last, where, it will be remembered, the lizards were eaten “bones\r\nand head and claws and all,” whereas here “the only parts _uneaten_ were\r\nthe jaws and part of the skin.” This lizard, however, was “at least five\r\ninches long from nose to extremity of tail”; but then, again, the spider\r\nmust have been larger too, though clearly its meal was something in the\r\nnature of a feat, since after it “it remained gorged and motionless for\r\nabout a fortnight, being much swollen and distended.”[139] There is no\r\nmention of this in the other case, which would seem to imply that the\r\nresult was different. If so, we have here a fact of great interest—what\r\nfact, scientifically elicited, is not?—but in order to establish it upon\r\na really firm basis, further experiments should be made, and, once more,\r\nas the limit of size has evidently not yet been reached, I would\r\nrecommend a lizard of six inches long.\r\n\r\nThis spider, however, now I come to remember, is not really one, but a\r\n_solpugid_, and a _solpugid_ is a creature so like a spider that it used\r\nto be thought one some years ago, but now belongs, not only to a family,\r\nbut to an order of its own, which comes somewhere between the scorpions\r\nand the true spiders. They are large creatures, and their bite is very\r\nsevere, though it does not appear to be poisonous. Some of the species\r\nare nocturnal, as is the case with the one above mentioned, which was\r\nchristened _Galeodes vorax_ by its discoverer, Captain Hutton, if he\r\nindeed discovered it. Captain Hutton, being a great entomologist—to\r\nattain which title one has only to put pins through insects—used to lay\r\na sheet on the ground at night, and stand a lantern upon it. Numerous\r\ninsects were attracted to the light, and this brought _Galeodes_—who is\r\na great entomologist too, though without the pins—upon the _tapis_ or\r\n_draps_.[139]\r\n\r\nOften there would be fights between two rivals, and of these, or,\r\nrather, of the general fighting, and one may also say yielding, habits\r\nof the species, Captain Hutton gives the following somewhat curious\r\naccount. “They plant their true feet” (for these _Galeodes_ have a pair\r\nwhich look exactly like feet, but are really their palpi) “firmly on the\r\nground, the body at the same time being elevated and the two pairs of\r\npalpi held out in front, to ward off the attack. In this attitude they\r\nadvance and retire, according as either gains a slight advantage,\r\nendeavouring to throw each other to one side, so as to expose some\r\nvulnerable part or form an opening for attack; and when this is once\r\neffected the fortunate wrestler instantly takes advantage of it, and\r\nrushing in, seizes his adversary behind the thorax, and the combat is\r\nended, the vanquished victim yielding himself, without further struggle,\r\nto his inevitable fate.” Similarly, “if, in their efforts to get away,\r\nthey are brought into contact, the one instantly seizes the other and\r\ndevours him, the victim making no struggle whatever; but if they meet\r\nface to face they both enter into a wrestling match for life or death.”\r\n\r\nThis habit of yielding as soon as there is no more use in struggling\r\nseems a very strange one, since it is opposed to the primary instinct of\r\nself-preservation, and it is not easy to see how the species can benefit\r\nby certain individuals dying in a passive manner, unless, indeed, by\r\nrefusing to do so they might injure the victor, who, by dying\r\nafterwards, would add to the tribal mortality. If this be really the\r\nexplanation, we are reminded of Huber’s statement as to two queen bees,\r\nwhen each has it in its power to sting the other, being seized with a\r\nsort of horror, under the influence of which they separate, thus\r\navoiding the catastrophe of leaving the hive queenless.\r\n\r\nThough, as we have seen, there are some spiders which eat birds, and\r\nothers which eat lizards, yet both these interesting things take place\r\nabroad. Here, however, in England, it would seem that we have a spider\r\nwhich eats worms, catching them at the end of a long woven bag which\r\ndescends into the earth, and into which the worm somehow manages to get.\r\nHow it does so, however, is not at all clear, since the bag, which is\r\nsometimes a foot long, is described as having no opening at either end,\r\nthe spider living enclosed in it, apparently a permanent prisoner. Still\r\na sac like this would seem as difficult of entry for flies as for worms,\r\nand the spider, which is three-quarters of an inch in length, and armed\r\nwith very large mandibles, or falces—to use the approved word—must, it\r\nis plain, live on something. As a matter of fact, it was living on a\r\nworm when found by Mr. Brown, who gives the following account of the\r\nmatter. “On drawing out one of the sacs,” he says, “I observed a worm at\r\nthe lower end, partially within the sac and partially outside, and it\r\nwas evident that the spider had been eating a considerable portion of\r\nits anterior extremity.” One would have thought that a careful\r\nexamination of the way in which the worm had got into the sac would have\r\nthrown light on the problem, but of this we hear nothing more.\r\n\r\nWhen taken out of the ground the sac was limp and flaccid, but\r\nafterwards the spider inflated it, and it was then seen to have some\r\nminute valves—“openings,” that is to say, “protected or covered by a\r\nlittle valve or door.” They were not, however, to be detected in every\r\nnest—possibly on account of their very small size. That the object of\r\nthese valvular openings is to admit air seems obvious, for spiders\r\nbreathe through lungs and require a good supply of oxygen. It was now\r\nconcluded, both by Mr. Brown and Mr. Newman—a well-known\r\nentomologist—that this particular spider lived on worms and resided\r\npermanently in a long subterranean sac or bag, which it had the power of\r\ninflating with air. A different view, however, was propounded by Mr.\r\nMeade—an authority on spiders—who suggested that the worm had only got\r\ninto the sac by accident, and that the spider, like other subterranean\r\nnest-makers, probably came out at night and fed abroad, returning to\r\nrest at home during the daytime. To do this it would, indeed, have to\r\nunweave one end of its sac—probably the upper one—and then do it up\r\nagain, but there was no reason, in Mr. Meade’s opinion, why it should\r\nnot act in this way. To me, however, it seems unlikely that the minute\r\nvalves, made with such care, should be destroyed in this manner and made\r\nafresh every day; and moreover, when Mr. Brown looked again at the sac,\r\nin order to test this theory, he could find no evidence of its having\r\nbeen dealt with in this Penelopean manner. There were no traces of fresh\r\nsilk. The evidence, therefore, seems to be more in favour of _Attipus\r\nsulzeri_—for that is its name—being a genuine worm-eating spider. If so,\r\nit is worthy of all respect as a curiously aberrant form.[140]\r\n\r\nThese spiders are of a deep brown colour, with a very soft abdomen and a\r\ngenerally half-baked appearance, but with hard, black, shining\r\nmandibles. There was only a single individual—evidently the female—in\r\nthe sacs taken by Mr. Brown, but I myself was the finder of one such\r\nsac—for I feel sure it must have been the same—in the New Forest, and in\r\nthis a pair were amicably settled, one being about twice the size of the\r\nother. This, if I mistake not, was in May, but I also remember, or seem\r\nto, that the bag was quite open at one end. Thus, then, stand the facts.\r\nUpon them I think we are justified in believing that there is a\r\nworm-eating spider in England, but of course it would be a very high\r\nhonour for any country to have such a creature, so that there is a\r\ndanger of letting one’s patriotic feelings run away with one.\r\n\r\nIn these sac-making spiders we see, perhaps, the ancestors of, or rather\r\ntravellers towards, those which crown a silk-lined perpendicular tunnel\r\nwith a skilfully made trap-door. The latter is furnished with a hinge,\r\nand should it be discovered, the spider, seizing it from within,\r\nendeavours with might and main to prevent its being raised. As is well\r\nknown, the upper surface of these trap-doors, or, as we may call them,\r\nlids, are covered by the spider with such materials—leaves, grass, moss,\r\netc.—as surround the site of its nest, so that when shut down they are\r\nindistinguishable from the general surface of the ground.\r\n\r\nAnother use to which the webs of spiders are put is that of a parachute,\r\non which the little creature—for small species alone may enjoy this\r\nluxury—sails delicately through the air. This, however is not the\r\nnearest approach made by any of the tribe to actual flight, though in\r\npractice it almost surpasses that power, even as possessed by many\r\nwinged insects, who do indeed cleave the air, but cannot ride upon it in\r\na filmy chariot, twinkling in the rays of the sun. Still there is one\r\nspider that, though it has not yet achieved wings, is in process of\r\ndeveloping them. This little semi-Ariel—but the subject will be best\r\ndone justice to in the glowing language of the Rev. O. P. Cambridge:\r\n“Adult male, length rather above two lines. The abdomen is of an\r\nelongated oval form, and rather flattened; its upper side is furnished\r\nwith an epidermis, which is continued, laterally, on either side to an\r\nextent considerably exceeding the width of the abdomen, and of a\r\nsemi-oval or elliptical form; the outer portion of this epidermis, on\r\neither side, is capable of being depressed and folded round the abdomen,\r\nor elevated and expanded to its full width, after the manner of wings.\r\nMr. H. H. B. Bradley, of Sydney, New South Wales, to whom I am indebted\r\nfor examples of this exceedingly interesting and remarkable spider,\r\ntells me that he has observed them elevating and depressing the flaps,\r\nand also actually using them as wings or supporters to sustain the\r\nlength of their leaps. That this, as with an analogous appendage in the\r\nflying squirrel, should be intended for such sustentation one could have\r\nbut little doubt, after examining it even in the preserved specimens.\r\nThe three examples were all found on one spot near Sydney, in the month\r\nof October, running and jumping on low plants and flowers.”[141]\r\n\r\nIt is delightful to think of a little delicate spider-body like this,\r\nrising gracefully from the petal of one flower, expanding its thin,\r\nfilmy fringes, and descending in a long slanting line through the air,\r\nlike a flying squirrel or a galeopithecus, onto the petal of another.\r\nEven were its appearance no more than elegant, this would be a most\r\npleasing sight. But it is much more than this. Various hues meet in its\r\ndiminutive body, and so harmonious and pleasing is the general effect\r\nproduced by them that the first captor of so much loveliness was\r\nenraptured as he gazed on his prize, whilst even Mr. Cambridge, with\r\nonly dried specimens to fire his imagination, yet cannot choose but\r\nexclaim: “It is difficult to describe adequately the great beauty of the\r\ncolouring of this spider.”[141]\r\n\r\nSpiders, then, either through gossamer or their own structural\r\nmodification, seem engaged in the conquest of the air. There remains but\r\nthe water, and this element also they have partly subdued. There are\r\nraft-spiders and diving-bell spiders. The first, having woven a few\r\ndried leaves, stalks, grasses, etc., launches out as courageously from\r\nthe shore as the first navigator, whose heart, according to Horace, was\r\nthrice bound in brass, but who probably was timid and cautious. Our\r\nspider, however, has no fears, nor need it to have any, since no sort of\r\ncapsizal can affect a structure which answers its purpose as well one\r\nside up as another; whilst even if it were to sink—though that hardly\r\nlies in its nature—there is always the water to run on. The raft, in\r\nfact, is only like the nest or web ashore—a place to have a comfortable\r\nmeal in. The prey—some aquatic insect—is caught generally on the surface\r\nof the stream, and the spider, after each successful raid, skims back\r\nwith her booty to the little self-guiding boat which it has temporarily\r\nleft. There, when no longer hungry, she sits and scuds about, careless\r\nand pleasure-loving, like another little Phædria in her “flitt barck”\r\nover the waters of the Idle Lake.[142]\r\n\r\n“Thus,” says Büchner, “everywhere in nature are battle, craft, and\r\ningenuity, all following the merciless law of egoism, in order to\r\nmaintain their own lives and to destroy those of others.” In man,\r\nindeed, there is some counterpoise to all this in the mind and _façon de\r\nparler_; but the lower animals do not think so much, and, having no\r\nproper language, cannot even talk altruistically.\r\n\r\nLastly, we have the water-spider, whose little spun nest, against the\r\nsubmerged stem of some aquatic plant, is open at the bottom like a\r\ndiving-bell, and filled with air which its owner carries down from the\r\nsurface in successive bubbles, each one looking “like a globe of\r\nquicksilver.” To collect them she swims on her back, and, in some\r\nmanner, entangles them amongst the numerous hairs with which her abdomen\r\nis covered, where they cling safely all through the journey,\r\n\r\n                     “Proud of that delicate lodgment.”\r\n\r\nThere may be other bubbles as pretty, perhaps, but few, by bursting, do\r\nsuch good to those who have cherished them. In winter, it would seem,\r\nthe spider closes the entrance to the diving-bell, and sleeps, dry and\r\nsoft, in a well-aired bed, in spite of the damp situation.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 136:\r\n\r\n  Vinson, Aranéides des Iles de la Réunion, Maurice, et Madagascar, pp.\r\n  268, 269.\r\n\r\nFootnote 137:\r\n\r\n  Bates, The Naturalist on the River Amazon (1864), p. 96.\r\n\r\nFootnote 138:\r\n\r\n  Annals and Magazine of Natural History, vol. x.

Of these, so long as the water be fresh, and not salt,\r\nthere are many, and the largest, perhaps, if he exceeds some of the\r\ndragon-fly larvæ and the Giant Water-Bug of America, must be the Great\r\nWater-Beetle—_Hydrophilus piceus_—which is larger even than the much\r\ncommoner one—_Dytiscus_—which everybody knows, and which is _the_\r\nwater-beetle to most people.\r\n\r\nIt is the fate of some animals to become associated for all time in our\r\nminds with the name of some particular man, as, for instance, the bee is\r\nwith that of Huber, and the ephemera with that of Swammerdam. Again, the\r\nfame of Lyonnet, though he was skilled in eight languages, and became\r\ncypher secretary and confidential translator to the United Provinces of\r\nHolland, is principally bound up with a certain caterpillar, viz. that\r\nof the goat moth, of which creature, though only an amateur in such\r\nmatters, he made dissections and executed plates, which have never yet\r\nbeen surpassed, and are supposed to be entirely unsurpassable. In a\r\nlesser degree his memory is associated with this particular\r\nwater-beetle—the great one, into the heart of whose mystery he was the\r\nfirst to pierce: “In the beginning of July,” he tells us, “I had noticed\r\nin the ditches a kind of cocoon which I did not recognise. It was\r\nwhitish, of the size of the end of the finger, nearly spherical, but\r\nrather oval and flattened. The surface, which looked like tow, was not\r\nquite smooth. One of the two ends was flatter than the other, and\r\nfurnished with a raised rim. From the space within this rim projected a\r\nsort of little tapering mast about as long as the cocoon.”[143]\r\n\r\nThese cocoons, when opened, were found to contain about a hundred eggs.\r\nLyonnet kept them in water till the eggs hatched. “The larvæ,” he says,\r\nwhen this had taken place, “remained one day enclosed in the cocoon\r\nbefore escaping. Then they made an oval aperture in the lower part of\r\nthe flattened end of the cocoon, and escaped through this into the\r\nwater.”[143] Here they fed upon snails, their manner of eating which is\r\nthus described: “The larva seizes the snail with its mandibles, then\r\nbends its body backwards and rests the snail upon the broad back, which\r\nserves as a table (as with the larva of the grain-eating ant of Texas).\r\nIn this position, holding the snail in its legs, the larva breaks the\r\nshell, and devours it.”[143]\r\n\r\nWhen full-fed the larvæ left the water, and one of them was placed by\r\nLyonnet in a box full of moistened earth. This it entered, and, some\r\ndays afterwards, changed into a large white pupa or chrysalis, about\r\nwhich there was one curious feature, viz. that “on each side of the\r\nhead”—or, as an entomologist would say nowadays, “on the fore part of\r\nthe prothorax—were three brown, strong hooks. Two others of the same\r\nkind were found at the hinder end of the body.”[143] These hooks were\r\nsolid, so that they could contain no part of the perfect insect, and\r\nLyonnet points to them as good examples of _apparently_ useless\r\nstructures. Their office, indeed, he himself knows, but he does not\r\nreveal it till the usual philosopher has been imagined who denies that\r\nthey can have any. Then, of course, comes the anticipated discomfiture\r\nof this unwary person—so frequent in the eighteenth century—who,\r\nunwarned by experience, has walked quietly into the trap. “In the damp\r\nearth which the pupa requires the above-described hooks fulfil a\r\npurpose, unexpected by us, but, at the same time, of great importance.\r\nThe skin of the pupa is very delicate. Lying on damp earth, it could\r\nhardly escape injury, and the weight of the body might easily give it a\r\ndistorted shape. But (_Monsieur le Philosophe_) the pupa protects itself\r\nfrom these dangers by assuming an unusual attitude. It extends itself\r\nback downwards in a horizontal position, and supports the weight of its\r\nbody by the three sets of hooks, as upon a tripod. In this attitude,\r\nthough surrounded on all sides by moist earth, it keeps its body from\r\nactual contact with any object until it has assumed its final shape.\r\nThus,” continues Lyonnet, turning full upon the stupefied philosopher,\r\n“we see how necessary are those hooks, which at first sight appeared so\r\nuseless. To decide that this or that structure is superfluous because we\r\ncannot guess its use is truly ridiculous in beings whose information is\r\nso limited as ours.”[143] Applauding shouts (“_Mais certainement!_”\r\n“_C’est vrai cela!_”) rend the air, and the imaginary philosopher goes\r\nout in a state of painful confusion.\r\n\r\nThe above facts, first made known by Lyonnet, have been confirmed by\r\nsubsequent observers, such as Miger, and the pupa of another and much\r\nsmaller water-beetle is now known to support itself in the same manner,\r\nor, rather, on the same principle, since the place of hooks at either\r\nextremity is taken by spiny projections, with which the back is covered.\r\n\r\nLyonnet now turned his attention to the mature beetle, and especially to\r\nthe female, whom he was anxious to see make her cocoon. Having put a few\r\nin a large wooden trough and supplied them with some floating weed, “I\r\nhad,” he says, “before long, the pleasure of seeing the female\r\n_Hydrophilus_ betake herself to work under my eyes. I found, to my\r\nsurprise, that, like the spider, she had her spinneret at the hinder end\r\nof the body. Two small brown prominences enclosed each a delicate\r\nconical tube, from each of which a separate thread proceeded, and with\r\nthese the cocoon was woven in the following way. At first, lying\r\nupside-down near the surface of the water, the beetle buried the hinder\r\npart of her body, and the two hindermost pairs of legs, in the weed,\r\nwhilst with the first pair, which were free, she drew and pressed the\r\nweed around the end of her body, moulding it to its shape. She then\r\nbegan to weave what seemed the under half of her cocoon, but having\r\nfinished this part she turned over with it so that it became the upper\r\nhalf, and then wove the real under one. The two curved surfaces were\r\nthen woven together, and in about an hour and a quarter the body of the\r\ncocoon was finished. For about two hours after this the beetle remained\r\nstill, her back being uppermost. At first her body was buried in the\r\ncocoon up to the thorax, but one could see that she was gradually\r\nwithdrawing it. During these two hours of apparent rest she laid her\r\neggs, not at hazard, but in regular order, side by side, the pointed\r\nends uppermost. This work accomplished, she closed the mouth of the\r\ncocoon, and then began to spin the little mast, which gradually rose\r\nabove the surface of the water till it had attained the requisite\r\nheight, and the cocoon was then finished.”[143]\r\n\r\nLyonnet was unable to discover the use of the so-called mast, and it\r\nremains a mystery to this day, so that the imaginary philosopher might\r\nhave a better chance here, were it not his _métier_ to be put to\r\nconfusion. It is hollow, and as the cocoon contains air, with which the\r\nbeetle supplies it—just as the water-spider does her diving-bell—Miger,\r\nwhose observations were made in 1807, some fifty years after those of\r\nLyonnet, supposed it might serve as the channel of entry. But, although\r\nhollow, it has no orifice, but is closed at the end, and this does not\r\nseem to accord with the above view. Mr. G. A. Laker, a modern observer,\r\ndoes not think that the spike can serve as a balance to the cocoon,\r\nsince this is usually attached to some weed, or other supporting\r\nsubstance. He, however, cut the spike off two of the cocoons, and the\r\neggs in both of these remained unhatched. Moreover, these cocoons\r\nsubsequently sank, whereas in their normal state they “are so\r\nconstructed that when floating loose the spike retains its proper\r\nposition, and even if the cocoon be held so that the spike is parallel\r\nwith the water and then suddenly released, it immediately rights\r\nitself.”[144] The balance theory, therefore, certainly seems to have\r\nsomething in its favour. Lyonnet’s own conjecture was that the mast, as\r\nhe calls it—a designation against which Miger protests—might merely\r\nrepresent the waste silk which the beetle felt impelled to get rid of.\r\nThe time taken by the beetle in making the whole cocoon is about five\r\nhours, whilst the mast, spike, or turned-up point, as Miger severely\r\ncalls it, takes it half an hour. It is curious that whereas Lyonnet’s\r\ncocoons held “about a hundred” eggs, Mr. Laker gives the number as\r\n“usually between fifty and sixty.”[144]\r\n\r\nAs space has its exigencies—and long may it continue to have—I will here\r\nmerely mention such names as _Gyrinus_, _Dytiscus_, _Hydrobius_,\r\n_Donacia_, etc., “and let _them_ speak for me,” but having paid some\r\nattention to the great water-beetle, silence in regard to the giant\r\nwater-bug would be hardly gracious, and might be ill taken. This\r\nterrific creature is like a monstrous exaggeration of our own\r\nwater-scorpion, to which it bears a distorted, but real resemblance,\r\nminus, however, the long ovipositor—the so-called tail behind. Its\r\nappearance is not to be described. Like other bugs, and as are the\r\naphides and cicadas for less cruel purposes, it is armed with a long,\r\nsharp-pointed beak, through which, having plunged it into the body of\r\nits prey, on whose back it has previously leaped, it sucks the\r\nlife-juices, holding on, all the while, with its two curved, claw-like\r\nfront legs. Its strength is in accordance with its size, and both are\r\nsuch that it finds no one in its own circle, so to speak, at all capable\r\nof contending with it. “It is the facile master of the ponds and\r\nestuaries of the tidal creeks and rivers of the Atlantic States,” says\r\nUhler. “Developing in the quiet pools, secreting itself beneath stones\r\nor rubbish, it watches the approach of a _Pomotis_, mud-minnow, frog, or\r\nother small-sized tenant of the water, when it darts with sudden\r\nrapidity upon its unprepared victim, grasps the creature with its\r\nstrong, clasping fore-legs, plunges its deadly beak deep into the flesh,\r\nand proceeds with the utmost coolness to leisurely suck its blood. A\r\ncopious supply of saliva is poured into the wound, and no doubt aids in\r\nproducing the paralysis which so speedily follows its puncture in small\r\ncreatures.”[145]\r\n\r\nAnother American water-bug of similar build, but much smaller size, has\r\nthe same general habits, to which it adds the more special one of\r\ncarrying about its eggs on its back, where, in time, they are hatched,\r\nbut do not, it would appear—though this seems somewhat out of harmony\r\nwith the practical spirit of nature—proceed at once to suck their\r\nparent’s blood, an omission which, as it would be a most moving instance\r\nof unselfish surrender on the part of the latter, is, perhaps, to be\r\nregretted. Possibly the reason is that the eggs are not fixed upon the\r\nright back, so that even were this _dénouement_ to take place, we should\r\nnot have an instance of maternal, but only of paternal affection. This,\r\nfor some reason, is not so effective as the other, and therefore Nature,\r\nwho, as we know, is a consummate artist, may not care to waste her\r\nmaterials on an inferior situation.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, the fact that the domestic economy of these\r\nwater-bugs did not proceed, throughout, upon the lines that might have\r\nbeen expected may first have led a German observer—Schmidt—to suspect\r\nsomething unusual, in consequence of which misgiving he looked more\r\nclosely into the matter, and found—what had not before been\r\nimagined—that the male and not the female was the egg-bearer. He was\r\nnot, however, able to determine how this arrangement was brought about,\r\nor with what feelings the male received and bore his burden. This was\r\nleft for Miss Slater, who found that the females in her aquarium\r\ninsisted upon laying their eggs on the backs of the males, that the\r\nlatter objected to their doing so, which led to a struggle between the\r\ntwo, often lasting for two or three hours, but ending invariably in the\r\nvictory of the female. The male has, then, to bow to necessity, but he\r\ndoes not do so in a cheerful spirit, nor even without some further\r\nefforts to escape his destiny. “That he chafes under the burden,” says\r\nMiss Slater, “is unmistakable; in fact my suspicions as to the sex of\r\nthe egg-carrier were first aroused by watching one in an aquarium which\r\nwas trying to free itself from its load of eggs, an exhibition of a lack\r\nof maternal interest not to be expected in a female carrying her own\r\neggs. Generally the _Zaithas_ are very active, darting about with great\r\nrapidity, but an egg-bearer remains quietly clinging to a leaf, with the\r\nend of the abdomen just out of the water. If attacked he meekly receives\r\nthe blows, seemingly preferring death (which, in several cases, was the\r\nresult) to the indignity of carrying and caring for the eggs.”[145] This\r\nlast, however, is not very explicit, so that, the whole account not\r\nbeing to hand, I cannot say what precisely happened.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that the male should be so spiritless, after receiving the\r\neggs, for this would seem to nullify such advantages as the arrangement\r\nmight otherwise offer. The eggs must be laid somewhere, and might be\r\nsupposed safer on the back of the male than elsewhere—in which fact,\r\nperhaps, we may see the origin of the instinct. But if the male, sinking\r\nunder his burden, is able neither to defend himself nor it, this\r\nadvantage seems nullified.\r\n\r\nEstuaries and tidal creeks, which, as we have seen, are included in the\r\nhabitat of these water-bugs—at least, of the giant one—bring us\r\ngradually to the sea. That there are marine insects we know, but they do\r\nnot appear to extend beyond the tidal beach, on the sands of which they\r\nexpatiate, when the sea is out, and burrow into them on its return. All\r\nare small, and still smaller is the amount said about them, even in such\r\nworks as are precisely those where all that is known on the subject\r\nought to be stated—systematic works of natural history, for instance,\r\nwhich take “_Arthropoda_ (Insects, etc.)” in their due order, but do not\r\nso much as tell you whether marine ones exist or not. Yet the date of\r\nsuch works is after 1895. For these reasons, and another which has been\r\nonce or twice before alluded to, I have but one remark to make about\r\nmarine insects, and I will make that in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 143:\r\n\r\n  Mémoires du Muséum, vols. 18-20.\r\n\r\nFootnote 144:\r\n\r\n  Entomologist, vol. 14 (1881), p. 82.\r\n\r\nFootnote 145:\r\n\r\n  Quoted in The Insect Book, by Leland O.

This seems curious,\r\nbecause, as everyone knows, other sea-dwelling creatures are, producing\r\nmost wonderful and beautiful effects, and, moreover, the luminous\r\nproperty is active in many terrestrial insects. Of these the glow-worm\r\nis a familiar and, though, perhaps, the humblest, a very beautiful\r\nexample. At any rate, there are insects of the glow-worm family whose\r\nfires are far less “ineffectual,” or, to speak more truly, far outglow\r\nthose of our own species. What, for instance, can be more gorgeous than\r\nthe green or orange lights—for they differ in colour according to the\r\nsexes—with which the nights and the rich vegetation of the West Indies\r\nare brilliantly, yet softly, lit up? Nothing, surely, if it be not the\r\nname of the creature producing such splendour, which is _Pygolampis\r\nxanthophotis_[146]—not one syllable less.\r\n\r\nWhether it is the male or the female that gives out the green or the\r\norange light, I do not know, nor in my opinion do various monographists\r\nin various encyclopædias and text-books, though they make no such\r\navowal, but content themselves with not saying. However, it is not a\r\nmatter of importance except to the insect producing it, in whose breast\r\nthe one or the other colour arouses very different sensations—rivalry or\r\nlove. For there is no doubt now that these lovely illuminations, as well\r\nas those of our own glow-worm and of every other light-bearing creature,\r\nhave relation to the needs and wants of their producers, to whose\r\næsthetic sense, and not to ours, they are intended to appeal. That they\r\nappeal also to our own is a mere irrelevant side-issue, not considered,\r\nso to speak, by the force under whose pressure these beauties were\r\ncalled forth, and not of the smallest consequence. It was not always\r\nthought so, and were the pride of man reachable by such considerations\r\nit might humiliate us to reflect that displays, which in real beauty\r\nimmeasurably surpass our clumsy illuminations and fireworks, are made\r\nnightly, not for our eyes, but for those of a beetle.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INSECTS THAT CARRY LAMPS\r\nThe glow-worms in this picture are rather larger than life. The male\r\ninsects have wings; it is the females chiefly, if not solely, that emit\r\nthe soft, beautiful light.]\r\n\r\nGilbert White, however, in the eighteenth century, exclaims amidst some\r\nvery pleasing verses:\r\n\r\n           “For see, the glow-worm lights her amorous fire!”[148]\r\n\r\non which one of his editors of the nineteenth remarks: “This is still\r\nthe generally received notion, but the fact is that both sexes of the\r\nglow-worm are phosphorescent, not only in the perfect insect, but also\r\nin the larva and even pupa state.”[147] But this does not affect White’s\r\nstatement, which is the simple fact, as well as “the generally received\r\nnotion,” and, moreover, though our own male glow-worm is phosphorescent,\r\nit is not so brilliantly so as the female. Indeed, in the ninth edition\r\nof the _Encyclopædia Britannica_—which is later than this editorial\r\nnote—it is stated not to be so at all, so that even if White believed\r\nthis—which is not very clear—he has been supported by learned authority\r\nfor a very long time.\r\n\r\nIn other species the male is the more brilliant, or the sexes do not\r\ndiffer greatly in this respect, each one lighting its “amorous fire” in\r\nthe degree that nature allows it to—as no doubt our own male does too.\r\nOf this fact, which, in the light of Darwinism, might have been boldly\r\nassumed, there is no longer any doubt after Professor Emery’s\r\ninteresting observations[149] on the Italian species _Luciola Italica_.\r\nThese were made in the meadows around Bologna, where, having caught some\r\nfemales, the Professor imprisoned them in glass tubes and laid them down\r\namidst the grass. In this situation, though smell as an attractive agent\r\nwas excluded, males would come flashing to the glass, and, on the other\r\nhand, as soon as the lamp of any of these became visible, the female\r\nwould kindle her own, if it had previously been unlighted. Arrived on\r\nthe spot, the male would dash madly about the unapproachable female, who\r\ncontinued to light her lamp at him till another, and then others,\r\narrived, when it is to be supposed that her favours were distributed. In\r\nthe end there would sometimes be a dozen fiery rivals glowing and\r\nflashing round the tube. But though the female shot out her attractive\r\nbeams with evident intent to please, it does not appear that she was the\r\nseeker in the business, since we hear only of males flying to the\r\nimprisoned females, and not of females pursuing these males. To such\r\nmodest merit, therefore, as a nice distinction between different ways of\r\nattaining the same end may entitle her, the female glow-worm also is\r\nentitled.\r\n\r\nThe light of the two sexes in the Italian glow-worm is described by\r\nProfessor Emery as being the same in colour and intensity, but differing\r\nin some other respects. The flashes of the male, for instance, are more\r\nquickly recurrent, whilst those of the female gleam out at longer\r\nintervals, but last for a longer time. They are, also, more tremulous,\r\nas well as more restricted, though what is meant by this last\r\nexpression, since the brightness is said to be equal, is not quite\r\napparent. Possibly it may imply that the light proceeds from a lesser\r\narea of the body, but, if so, this should be clearly stated, even in a\r\n_résumé_. I can find no reference to such a fact, if it be one, in the\r\ntext-books.\r\n\r\nFrom the above it is evident that the glow-worm’s fires are anything but\r\n“uneffectual” from the point of view of the insect, but Shakespeare was\r\nno doubt thinking of something very different—their paling, namely,\r\nbefore the light of dawn. According to Gilbert White, however, they\r\nshould have been out long ago—the glow-worm being too wise to afford\r\nopportunities of comparison in this respect. Thus subtly does the\r\nnaturalist of Selborne impugn the accuracy of the Bard of Avon: “By\r\nobserving,” he says, “two glow-worms which were brought from the field\r\nto the bank in the garden, it appeared to us that these little creatures\r\nput out their lamps between eleven and twelve, and shine no more for the\r\nrest of the night.”[149] The intention here, though cleverly disguised,\r\nis not sufficiently so to escape detection. It was possibly seen through\r\nby the late Charles and Mary Cowden Clarke, who in one of the million or\r\nso notes to their edition of Shakespeare, say, without distinct\r\nreference to the passage in question:—“_Uneffectual._ There is double\r\nsignification included in this word; it means the glow-worm’s light,\r\nwhich shines without giving heat, and which no longer shows when morning\r\nappears.”[150] Thus whilst not committing themselves to White’s opinion\r\nthey provide a safe refuge for their author, in case it should prove in\r\ntime to be correct; according to the sound principle contained in a\r\nRussian proverb which says, “Had he known where he was going to fall, he\r\nwould have laid down straw.”\r\n\r\nIn tropical countries fire-flies take the place of glow-worms with us,\r\nand though the light which these give out is not so soft and poetic as\r\nthe lovely green or golden green one of the latter, yet it is more\r\neffectively beautiful, owing to the way in which it wanders through the\r\nnight, appearing and disappearing in successive brilliant flashes. For\r\nhere the beetle that carries the lamp is a flier, and flashes it about\r\nat pleasure through the air, having the power, it would seem, either of\r\nshowing or concealing its light. The effect of a number of these points\r\nof brilliancy, gleaming out, now here, now there, on the soft night air\r\nof the tropics, is inexpressibly beautiful, as though, in a smaller\r\nfirmament, innumerable miniature stars had ceaseless birth and death.\r\n\r\nWomen, who like to emphasise their own beauty, or the want of it, by\r\nplacing themselves in juxtaposition with every lovely thing in nature,\r\nand care not if a thousand deaths go to help one smile or glance, have\r\nnot forgotten the fire-flies. They put them in their hair, or wire them\r\nonto their dresses, threading them together, sometimes, in long bands,\r\nwhich they wind about their fair—or otherwise—persons; they do this,\r\nmore especially, when going out to parties, fancy-dress balls, or other\r\nsocial entertainments. The advantages are obvious, for the homeliest\r\nfeatures may be thus lighted up, and the dullest woman become brilliant.\r\nNo wonder that in some South American cities—Vera Cruz for example—these\r\nfire-fly beetles form quite an important article of trade, all for\r\ntoilette purposes.[151] The natives catch them by waving sticks with\r\nburning coals tied to their ends through the air, by the light of which\r\nthey are attracted, and so come within reach of a long-handled butterfly\r\nnet. When caught, they are put into a box covered with a little netting\r\nof wire, and there kept till wanted. They are fed upon sugar-cane, and\r\ntwice a day must be bathed in tepid water.[151]\r\n\r\nWhat is done with the poor beetles after they have contributed to the\r\nnight’s amusement we are never told—whether those that have been all\r\nwired together are unwired and let go, or pulled off in two or more\r\npieces to save trouble, as seems more likely. It is likelier still\r\nperhaps, in the houses of the rich, that the whole thing is flung aside,\r\nand the poor living lamps left to struggle till they die—unprovided with\r\nsugar-cane. But such details are not thought worth mentioning. The\r\ncharming effect is the one thing dwelt upon, and charming it may very\r\nwell be, though to gain it through a mass of even insect discomfort is,\r\nto my mind, a contemptible thing. Fancy fifty or a hundred\r\nuncomfortable, writhing, struggling things on the dress that a lady is\r\ndancing in, every one of which, if let go, would make a wandering star\r\nin the air more really worth looking at than the whole ball-room\r\ntogether! By substituting flowers for women, however, effects far more\r\nbeautiful are gained through less reprehensible means. The\r\nfire-beetles—why should they be called flies?—are in this case confined\r\nin small globes of delicate glass, set amidst clusters of flowers, or\r\nflowering shrubs, and thus they softly illuminate the garden. Give them\r\nsome sugar-cane whilst the party is in progress, and let them go next\r\nmorning, and they will have had very little to complain of—a strange\r\nexperience for any lower creature that gets into the clutches of the\r\nhighest one.\r\n\r\nThe most wonderful of all the fire-beetles is the large one of near two\r\ninches long—quite, or more, if we count the antennæ—that inhabits\r\nMexico, where in ancient times it was used as a lantern by the Aztecs in\r\ntheir night-journeys, as it still is by their modern descendants. It is\r\nwonderful, not by reason of its size merely, or, in any special degree,\r\nof the light it emits—though this is brilliant in proportion to it—but\r\nbecause it carries three separate lamps: two above, situated on either\r\nside of the thorax, and one on the under side, just in front of the\r\nabdomen. Thus, as it turns or varies in its flight, one flash of the\r\nmost intense brilliancy follows another, like the revolving light of a\r\nlighthouse. The colour of the light is described as a rich\r\ngreen—richest, however, or at least brightest, on the under\r\nsurface.[151] The beauty and dazzling effect of this upon a dark night\r\ncan be imagined, and is thus described by Dr. Kidder: “Before retracing\r\nmy steps I stood for a few moments looking down into the Cimmerian\r\nblackness of the gulf before me; and while thus gazing a luminous mass\r\nseemed to start from the very centre. I watched it as it floated up,\r\nrevealing in its slow flight the long leaves of the palm _Euterpe\r\nedulis_, and the minuter foliage of other trees. It came directly\r\ntowards me, lighting up the gloom around with its three luminosities,\r\nwhich I could distinctly see.”[151] There is something wonderfully\r\npoetical in the thought of winged beings like this pursuing each other\r\nthrough the night, by the light of these glorious flashes—the “light of\r\ntheir own loveliness,” it may well be called, since it is, indeed, their\r\nbeauty. If seems curious and a waste that where there is the greatest\r\ncapacity of poetic imagination we should find the least, or almost the\r\nleast, realisation of it in habit and structure.\r\n\r\nWe know from Oviedo that the Mexican Indians, when they travelled at\r\nnight, were accustomed to fasten these great refulgent beetles on their\r\nhands and feet, and thus pass flaming through the country. They danced,\r\ntoo, by their light, and even wove or painted by it. Why, therefore,\r\ncould not lamps of great power, as well as beauty, be evolved from such\r\ninsects by bringing the selective agency of man to bear upon them? The\r\nphosphorescent principle in living nature has not perhaps been made the\r\nmost of by us. Was more made of it by the Aztecs? and did they turn\r\ntheir attention to the systematic rearing of these living lamps?—for,\r\nfrom hearing so little about them one would not think that these insects\r\nwere so useful now, as, from the above account and what other\r\ncontemporary Spanish writers tell us, it would seem that they were, at\r\nthe time of this old and cruelly destroyed civilisation.\r\n\r\nHolder, in his work on phosphorescent animals, either quotes or refers\r\nto Prescott as saying that “when the Spaniards visited the country”—that\r\nis, Mexico, “the air was filled with the _cucujo_, a species of large\r\nbeetle which emits an intense phosphoric light from its body strong\r\nenough to enable one to read by. These wandering flies, seen in the\r\ndarkness of the night, were converted by the excited imagination of the\r\nbesieged into an army of matchlocks.” Surely, from such a foundation,\r\nsomething as superior to it as are our cultivated fruits, or domestic\r\nbreeds, to the wild stocks from which they sprung, might in no long time\r\nbe produced, since it is not to be supposed but that some individuals of\r\nthe _Pyrophorus_ give a stronger light than others. The above passage,\r\nby the way, if it be from the _Conquest of Mexico_, as one might suppose\r\nit to be, is most carefully concealed in the index, which, however, it\r\nmight very well be, and yet exist, as I know from much teasing\r\nexperience. As to the matchlocks, would to Heaven the old Mexicans, as\r\nwell as the Peruvians, had had them, or, still better, 11-inch\r\nHowitzers. I might then have something more to say about these wonderful\r\nbeetles. All I can add now is that the light appears to be used by the\r\ninsect as a guide to its own movements, since when the celebrated Dr.\r\nDubois covered one of the side ones with wax, this caused the individual\r\nso treated to walk in a curve, and when “both spots were covered it soon\r\nstopped, and then moved in an uncertain manner, carefully feeling the\r\nground with its antennæ.”[151] But I do not know if “both” here means\r\nall three of the lamps, or only the two upper ones.\r\n\r\nIf there be any luminous insect that eclipses the _Pyrophorus_ it must\r\nbe the great lantern-fly—also of South America—provided only that the\r\ngreat lantern-fly _is_ luminous. That is a most essential point, and it\r\ndoes not appear yet to have been satisfactorily made out. The principal\r\nevidence on the affirmative side is that of Madame Merian, who was right\r\nabout the _Mygale_—the great bird-killing spider—and who here speaks as\r\nan actual eye-witness. Her account is as follows: “The Indians,” she\r\nsays, “once brought me, before I knew that they shone at night, a large\r\nnumber of these lantern-flies, which I shut up in a large wooden box. In\r\nthe night they made such a noise that I awoke in a fright, and ordered a\r\nlight to be brought, not knowing from whence the noise proceeded. As\r\nsoon as we found that it came from the box we opened it, but were still\r\nmore alarmed, and let it fall to the ground in a fright at seeing a\r\nflame of fire come out of it; and as many animals as came out, so many\r\nflames of fire appeared. When we found this to be the case we recovered\r\nfrom our fright, and again collected the insects, highly admiring their\r\nsplendid appearance.”[151]\r\n\r\nHere, then, is a definite statement, from which all possibility of\r\nmistake seems excluded, if, as I suppose is the case, there is no doubt\r\nas to the specific identity of the insect which was the subject of it,\r\nand which is thus described by Mr. Holder in the work already mentioned:\r\n“The _Fulgora lanternaria_ of South America,” he tells us, “is nearly\r\nthree and a half inches long from tip of head to extremity of tail (i.e.\r\nabdomen), and almost five and a half inches broad with its wings\r\nexpanded.” Truly a goodly insect, of right portly dimensions, and if it\r\nbe not really luminous—upon occasions, at any rate, for it certainly is\r\nnot so generally—it is so much the greater pity. But to continue: “The\r\nbody is of a lengthened oval shape, while the head is distinguished by a\r\nsingular prolongation, which sometimes equals the rest of the body in\r\nsize.” This is a most remarkable appendage, if it may be called so,\r\nhollow and with a blown-up, inflated sort of look. It does, indeed, to\r\nsome extent resemble a Chinese lantern, and seems made to be lighted up.\r\nThe colour, too, suggests this, since it is striped longitudinally with\r\nred and yellow, presenting quite a gala appearance. Accordingly, it is\r\nsaid to be here that the luminous property of this strange insect\r\nexists. This is its lantern, and, by reason of it, it has received its\r\nname of lantern-fly.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, since that night when Madame Merian had her interesting\r\nexperience, we meet with no one, apparently, who can unequivocally say\r\nthat he has seen the Great Lantern-Fly with its lantern alight. On the\r\nother hand, we have some second-hand statements which have almost the\r\nvalue of first, such as that of M. Westmael, who “assures us that a\r\nfriend of his observed the luminosity”;[151] whilst “John C. Branner,\r\nPH.D., states that when in South America he was often informed that it\r\nwas luminous, but never could find anyone who had personally seen the\r\nlight.”[151] The curious thing is that there are other lantern-flies\r\nbelonging to other parts of the world, and in regard to them too we have\r\nthe same doubt and discrepancy, the same assurances and general belief,\r\nthe same categorical denials. Thus a distinguished authority on the\r\nsubject of phosphorescence— Dr. Phipson—in referring to the smaller\r\nChinese species, _Fulgora candelaria_—the candle-fly—says: “It is from\r\nthese appendages, the sides of which are transparent, that the\r\nphosphoric light appears.” And again: “It is said also that the trunk of\r\na tree covered with numerous individuals of _Fulgora candelaria_, some\r\nin movement, others in repose, presents a very grand spectacle,\r\nimpossible to describe, but which may be witnessed sometimes in\r\nChina.”[151] It would seem, too, that there exists a Chinese edict which\r\nforbids young women to keep these candle-flies; and if this is not with\r\nthe idea of preventing their use as signals, or of checking vanity, it\r\nis difficult to see what the object of such an enactment can be.\r\n\r\nLastly, we are told by Packard, in his _Guide to Insects_, that “Mr.\r\nCaleb Cooke, of Salem, who resided several years in Zanzibar, Africa,\r\ntold me that the lantern-fly is said by the native to be luminous. They\r\nstate that the long snout lights up in the night, and in describing it\r\nsay its head is like a lamp (_keetchwa kand-tah_).”\r\n\r\nAll this evidence appears to me to point in one way, and one way only—I\r\nmean, of course, in its entirety, since otherwise it points in two ways.\r\nBut even if it is possible that in one country alone an insect—well\r\nknown and conspicuous—can have got the reputation of being luminous\r\nwithout really being so, at least occasionally, this can hardly have\r\ncome about in regard to the same, or some allied insect, in three or\r\nfour countries. Added to this we have Madame Merian’s direct evidence,\r\nbut, on the other hand, it is perfectly clear that these insects are not\r\nalways, or even generally, luminous. The conclusion, then, seems\r\nirresistible that they occasionally are so, that, for some reason or\r\nother, the phosphorescent principle is active in them only at certain\r\ntimes or seasons. Why this should be so we do not know, but there is\r\nnothing inconceivable in it; and some other animals—for instance,\r\ncentipedes—would seem to be luminous at some times and not at others.\r\n\r\nThe so-called lantern or snout being a very remarkable organ, for which\r\nsome use must be assumed, the likelihood of its sometimes becoming a\r\nlamp would be increased considerably, if, so far as we knew, it\r\nperformed no other office. This was how the case stood till lately; but\r\nin 1899 there was the Skeat Expedition for scientific purposes to the\r\nMalay Archipelago, and on its return Mr. Nelson Annandale propounded a\r\ntheory in regard to the more ordinary use, at least, of the organ in\r\nquestion, which was based on his own observation. His account is as\r\nfollows: “The curious anterior prolongation of the head in many genera\r\nof the _Fulgoridæ_ has long puzzled entomologists. At Biserat, in Jalor,\r\nI was fortunate enough to observe the real use of this peculiar\r\nstructural modification. On the morning of May 30th I noticed a specimen\r\nof _Hotinus spinola_ seated on the trunk of a Durian tree in the\r\nvillage, and incautiously attempted to catch it in my hand. The insect\r\nremained almost still, merely drawing in its legs towards its body and\r\npressing the claws firmly against the bark, until I had almost touched\r\nit. Then it lowered its head with very great rapidity, flew up into the\r\nair without spreading its wings, and alighted on the roof of a house six\r\nfeet behind a tree, and considerably higher than its position on the\r\ntrunk had been. At the time I did not notice anything peculiar in the\r\nway in which this _Fulgorid_ jumped, for there are many large species of\r\nthe same family which, without being provided with long noses, can leap\r\nfor a considerable distance by means of their legs only; but as I was\r\nexamining my specimen (a dead one) I was struck by an indentation or\r\ncrease that ran across the central region of the nose at right angles to\r\nits main axis. Then I discovered that at this point, and at this point\r\nonly, it was flexible, and that if the tip of the nose and the dorsal\r\nsurface of the abdomen were pressed together between the finger and\r\nthumb, and then suddenly released, the insect would not fall straight to\r\nthe ground, but would be propelled for some distance through the air\r\nbefore doing so, just as would be the case if a piece of whalebone were\r\ntreated in like manner.”[152]\r\n\r\nMr. Annandale then goes on to show, or to suggest, that the\r\n_Fulgorid_—as he calls it—by pressing its snout—or lantern—against the\r\ntree-trunk, and at the same time pushing itself off from it with its\r\nlegs, “would fly into the air at a tangent,” and he continues: “I have\r\nno doubt that this is substantially what occurs in the case of\r\n_Hotinus_; but in the living insect the action is far too rapid for the\r\neye to discriminate its details, and dead specimens cannot be made to\r\nleap in this way because it is impossible to force the legs to perform\r\ntheir part of the action.”[152] Such, then, is the theory, but as other\r\nmembers of the family jump in much the same way, to all appearance,\r\nwithout any such apparatus, and since the bending of the head, at such a\r\nmoment, might be correlated with the movements requisite to produce such\r\na leap as this, it certainly wants confirmation.\r\n\r\nSome of the finest displays of luminosity have been observed in\r\ncentipedes, which although not insects, may be counted such for the\r\npurpose of this volume. Thus M. Audouin, noticing one night a light\r\nproceeding from one of his chicory-fields, “ordered his man to turn up\r\nthe earth, when the scene that followed is described as truly\r\nmagnificent. The soil appeared as if it had been sprinkled with molten\r\ngold, the display being intensified if the insects were trodden upon or\r\nrubbed. In the latter case streaks of light appeared, as if a bit of\r\nphosphorus had been placed upon the hands, the light being distinctly\r\nvisible for twenty seconds.”[153]\r\n\r\nMr. Brodhurst, again, referring to another species—_Geophilus\r\nelectricus_—about an inch and a half in length, and in the daytime\r\ninconspicuous enough, says: “The light looked like moonlight, so bright\r\nwas it through the trees. It was a dark night, warm and sultry. Taking a\r\nletter, I could read it. It resembled an electric light, and proceeded\r\nfrom two centipedes and their trails. The light illuminated the entire\r\nbody of the animal, and seemed to increase its diameter three times. It\r\nflashed along both sides of the creature in sections, there being about\r\nsix, from head to tail, between which the light played, moving, as it\r\nwere, perpetually in two streams. The trail extended one and a half feet\r\nfrom each centipede over the grass and gravel walk, and it had the\r\nappearance of illuminated mucus. On securing one of the creatures for\r\nexamination, I found on touching it the light was instantly\r\nextinguished.”[153] The display is, therefore, voluntary, nor could Mr.\r\nBrodhurst ever get his centipedes to shine in captivity.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 146:\r\n\r\n  Chambers’s Encyclopædia.\r\n\r\nFootnote 147:\r\n\r\n  White, Natural History of Selborne (stereotyped edition), p. 84.\r\n\r\nFootnote 148:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., p. 353.\r\n\r\nFootnote 149:\r\n\r\n  Bull.

The\r\npopular belief is, that, if surrounded by fire, a scorpion will\r\ndeliberately sting itself to death. Of the fact, or, at least, of the\r\nfact of the self-inflicted sting, there can be little doubt, but in\r\nregard to the motive there is room for difference of opinion. Mr. Pocock\r\nsays, truly enough, that it is _à priori_ improbable that the scorpion\r\nhas any intention of killing itself.[154] But what, then, is its\r\nintention in stinging itself, supposing that it deliberately does so?\r\nNor must it be forgotten that the idea of death—of destruction—must be\r\nindissolubly associated in the scorpion’s mind with the use of its\r\nsting, since it uses it with that purpose only, and that is the result\r\nwhich constantly attends its use. Is it, then, really so improbable that\r\nit stings itself with the same intention as that with which it stings\r\nother creatures?—or, rather, with what other possible intention can it\r\ndo so, assuming the act to be a voluntary one?\r\n\r\nNor would it be necessary to prove the intention that the sting, thus\r\ndelivered, should be fatal in its effects, and, in regard to this, Mr.\r\nBourne has satisfied himself by experiments with some Indian scorpions\r\nthat a self-inflicted wound, or even wounds inflicted by individuals of\r\nthe same species on one another, have no effect. On the other hand, he\r\nfound that a moderately high temperature was fatal to his scorpions, and\r\nso concludes that this has been the real cause of death in all such\r\ncases as we are here considering.[154]\r\n\r\nThe above theory, however, hardly accords with the experience of Mr. W.\r\nG. Bidie, also of India, and that very part of it where Mr. Bourne’s\r\nexperiments were made—viz. Madras. Writing to _Nature_, he says: “One\r\nmorning a servant brought me a large specimen of this scorpion (the\r\ncommon black one of Southern India), which, having stayed out too long\r\nin its nocturnal rambles, had apparently got bewildered at daybreak and\r\nbeen unable to find its way home. To keep it safe the creature was at\r\nonce put into a glazed entomological case. Having a few leisure minutes\r\nin the course of the forenoon, I thought I would see how my prisoner was\r\ngetting on, and to have a better view of it, the case was placed in a\r\nwindow in the rays of the hot sun. The light and heat seemed to irritate\r\nit very much, and this recalled to my mind a story which I had read\r\nsomewhere that a scorpion on being surrounded with fire had committed\r\nsuicide. I hesitated about subjecting my pet to such a terrible ordeal,\r\nbut taking a common botanical lens, I focussed the rays of the sun on\r\nits back” (so that Apollo may have flayed Marsyas as a mild\r\nalternative). “The moment this was done it began to run hurriedly about\r\nthe case, hissing and spitting in a very fierce way. This experiment was\r\nrepeated some four or five times with like results, but on trying it\r\nonce again the scorpion turned up its tail and plunged the sting, quick\r\nas lightning, into its own back. The infliction of the wound was\r\nfollowed by a sudden escape of fluid, and a friend, standing by me,\r\ncalled out, ‘See! it has stung itself: it is dead.’ And sure enough in\r\nless than half a minute life was quite extinct.”\r\n\r\nThis seems plain enough. The scorpion had not died of the heat, up to\r\nthe moment at which it stung itself—an act which would require some\r\nvital energy. It did sting itself, and in less than half a minute\r\nafterwards it was dead. Moreover, as the experiments with the lens were\r\nintermittent, there seems no more reason why the last one should have\r\nbeen fatal than the other four or five. It is, perhaps, possible to\r\nimagine that the scorpion was almost dead before, that the last heating\r\ncaused it to expire, and that in the moment of doing so it stung itself\r\nby involuntary muscular action. There is nothing, however, in the\r\nnarrative to suggest this, but quite the contrary.\r\n\r\nSupposing the sting to have been a voluntary act, what could the\r\nscorpion have intended except to injure itself? Had it ever in its life\r\nused its sting with any other purpose than that of doing injury? Mr.\r\nBidie adds: “I have written this brief note to show (1) that animals may\r\ncommit suicide; (2) that the poison of certain animals may be\r\ndestructive to themselves.”[155]\r\n\r\nWriting several years later, also to _Nature_, Dr. Allen Thomson,\r\nF.R.S., gives the following account, not, indeed, of his own experience,\r\nbut that of an eye-witness in whom he feels full confidence. He says:\r\n“While residing, many years ago, during the summer months, at the baths\r\nof Sulla, in Italy, in a somewhat damp locality, my informant, together\r\nwith the rest of the family, was much annoyed by the frequent intrusion\r\nof small black scorpions into the house, and their being secreted among\r\nthe bedclothes, in shoes, and other articles of dress. It thus became\r\nnecessary to be constantly on the watch for these troublesome creatures,\r\nand to take means for their removal and destruction. Having been\r\ninformed by the natives of the place that the scorpion would destroy\r\nitself if exposed to a sudden light, my informant and her friends soon\r\nbecame adepts in catching the scorpions and disposing of them in the\r\nmanner suggested. This consisted in confining the animal under an\r\ninverted drinking-glass or tumbler, below which a card was inserted, and\r\nthen, waiting till dark, suddenly bringing the light of a candle near to\r\nthe glass in which the animal was confined. No sooner was this done than\r\nthe scorpion invariably showed signs of great excitement, running round\r\nand round the interior of the tumbler with reckless velocity for a\r\nnumber of times. This state having lasted for a minute or more, the\r\nanimal suddenly became quiet, and, turning its tail on the hinder part\r\nof its body over its back, brought its recurved sting down upon the\r\nmiddle of the head, and, piercing it forcibly, in a few seconds became\r\nquite motionless, and, in fact, quite dead. This observation was\r\nrepeated very frequently.”[156]\r\n\r\nHere, again, it is difficult to see how a mistake in observation can\r\nhave occurred, and admitting the facts to be true, they go far beyond\r\nMr. Bourne’s theory to account for these phenomena, which, however, has\r\nbeen adopted by Mr. Pocock, as the result of his own experiments. In the\r\nfirst place, it is not here the heat—unless by association of ideas—but\r\nthe actual sight of the flame that terrifies the scorpion, and death,\r\napparently, is inflicted as the result of that. Again, there can be no\r\ndoubt as to the self-inflicted stinging, and from the manner of it, as\r\nwell as its invariability, it seems to have been deliberate. Whether\r\ndeath was the result of it or not, we have the act, and the act, if a\r\nvoluntary one, must have implied a destructive intention. It hardly\r\nseems possible, however, that the light of a candle, outside a tumbler,\r\nthough held near it, can in so short a time have made the interior so\r\nhot as to kill the scorpion, whilst, on the other hand, the poison from\r\nthe creature’s sting must have pierced its brain, and a few seconds\r\nafterwards it was dead.\r\n\r\nIf, then, we decide to disbelieve in the story of scorpions committing\r\nsuicide when unable to escape from fire, we must explain away these two\r\naccounts, which we can do by supposing the narrators to be either\r\ndishonest or stupid. There is no other way that I can see, so if neither\r\nof these do, we ought to believe the story. However, there is plenty of\r\nevidence which points in the opposite direction, and the advantage of\r\nthis is that we can take our choice.\r\n\r\nScorpions are interesting animals to keep in captivity, and their habits\r\nunder these conditions have been carefully studied by Mr. Pocock.[154]\r\nWhen supplied with sand they dig pits in it, in which they lie during\r\nthe greater part of the day. The second and third pairs of legs are used\r\nfor this purpose, the scorpion raising itself upon the other two pairs,\r\nas well as, to a certain extent, upon the claws and the end of the tail.\r\nIn this position it kicks the sand backwards from under it, and then\r\nwhen the excavation is sufficiently deep, sweeps away the accumulated\r\nheap, with its tail, so that the edge of its lurking-place is on a level\r\nwith the surrounding surface. It can thus, as it lies there, obtain an\r\nuninterrupted view, which the better enables it to receive with proper\r\nattention any creature of the requisite size and quality that approaches\r\nits portals. Such creatures are principally insects, spiders,\r\ncentipedes, wood-lice, and the like—but here we may remember one little\r\nspider that imitates a scorpion, and may therefore approach with\r\nimpunity, at least if the disparity in size be not too great, for whilst\r\nsome scorpions are quite small, others attain a length of eight or nine\r\ninches, with a bulk more than in proportion to their length.\r\n\r\nIn captivity, and, no doubt, under nature too, when they happen to come\r\nacross them, scorpions will eat cockroaches, but a cockroach is not\r\naltogether a defenceless creature, and sometimes a large one will give\r\nbattle, and even with success. The weapons upon which, in these cases,\r\nit relies are its powerful hind legs armed, as they are, with spines\r\nwhich project backwards. Backwards accordingly it advances upon the\r\nscorpion, and increasing its pace suddenly, when at the requisite\r\ndistance salutes the astonished enemy with a shower of kicks. So\r\nunexpected is this mode of assault that it is sometimes effective, even\r\nagainst so redoubtable an opponent as a scorpion, whilst a tarantula\r\nspider has been known to fly, panic-stricken, before or rather behind a\r\nlarge cockroach. But such efforts, however heroic, can have only a\r\ntransient success, where the conditions are so unequal. Jaws and sting\r\nmust prevail against soft bodies armed only with spiny legs. “_Alla\r\nstoccata_ carries it away.” Generally the poor cockroach is\r\nseized—sometimes, in the first instance, by the antennæ—as it comes\r\ninadvertently too near to the scorpion, or even trespasses upon its\r\nback. At once the tail is bent above it, and the fatal sting enters its\r\nbody. Paralysis ensues, and would no doubt be quickly followed by death,\r\neven were the scorpion, thereupon, to retire. As it is, however, it is\r\ndifficult to say whether the victim dies more of the sting or of being\r\neaten.\r\n\r\nFrom the latter process, at any rate, there is no recovery, as may be\r\nseen in the case of smaller cockroaches, upon whom the scorpion, from\r\nmotives of economy, does not always waste its poison. It merely, when\r\nthus provident, holds the contemptible creature in its claws, whilst\r\nbringing to bear upon it its two pairs of chelæ or real jaws, which act\r\nupon the same principle as those of _Galeodes vorax_, if the reader\r\nremember. It feeds in a leisurely manner, the impatience of the\r\ncockroach not affecting it in the least. Two hours for a good-sized\r\none—a _pièce de résistance_—is not considered too long by the scorpion.\r\n\r\nScorpions, it appears, use their stings in a very careful, deliberate\r\nmanner. It is not a mere random thrust with them, lunged in anywhere,\r\njust as the body of an insect happens to come. On the contrary, they\r\nfeel about this body, most anxiously, with their tail, till they have\r\nfound a soft spot in it, and then introduce their sting in a careful\r\nmanner. In fact, they sting an insect in much the way that Isaak Walton\r\nimpaled a frog upon the hook—“tenderly as if they loved him”—and for the\r\nsame class of reason, viz. to make a workmanlike job of it, and not\r\nbreak their stings against the harder parts of its body, for the point\r\nof this weapon is delicate and might get chipped against the hard shards\r\nof a beetle, or other such resisting surface.\r\n\r\nFor the same prudent reason the tail is carried aloft, over the\r\nscorpion’s back, when it walks, so that the whole organ, but especially\r\nthe point of it, which is curled round again underneath, is preserved\r\nfrom contact with the outer world. The sting, or rather the sides of the\r\npoison vesicle just above it, are clothed with hairs, which are, no\r\ndoubt, delicately tactile, and the same may be said of the tail and\r\nvarious other parts of the body. Touch, indeed, is the principal sense\r\nwhich conveys impressions to the soul of the scorpion. Sight is\r\ndefective, and hearing does not seem to exist.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n           WILLIAM BRENDON AND SON, LTD., PRINTERS, PLYMOUTH\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 154:\r\n\r\n  Nature, June 1st, 1893.\r\n\r\nFootnote 155:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., vol. xi.\r\n\r\nFootnote 156:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., vol. xx. p. 577.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                          Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n Title page - Added missing period\r\n\r\n Pg. 42 - Changed ‘free-booter’ > ‘freebooter’ in caption to match\r\n illustration index and rest of text\r\n\r\n Pg. 106 - “Unto to me” > “Unto me”\r\n\r\n Pg. 140 - “Tierra del Fuega” > “Tierra del Fuego”\r\n\r\n Pg. 203 - ‘plausibilty’ > ‘plausibility’\r\n\r\n Pg. 137 & 142 - ‘aphis’ > ‘Aphis’ to match other instances\r\n\r\n Pg. 145 - Corrected typo: ‘Sycænidæ’ > ‘Lycænidæ’\r\n\r\n Pg. 187 - Corrected typo: ‘Bell’ > ‘Belt’\r\n\r\n Pg. 217 - Corrected typo: “312, 33” > “312, 313” - Source checked\r\n\r\n Pg. 222 - Added missing close-quote w/reference to source\r\n\r\n Pg. 222 - Corrected typo: ‘Amophila’ > ‘Ammophila’\r\n\r\n Pg. 253 - Corrected typo: ‘caterpilllar’ > ‘caterpillar’\r\n\r\n Pg. 270 - Corrected typo: ‘replique’ > ‘réplique’\r\n\r\n Pg. 290 - Corrected typo: ‘exisit’ > ‘exist’\r\n\r\n Pg. 334 - Corrected typo: ‘especally’ > ‘especially’\r\n\r\n Except for the above, inconsistent hyphenation, as well as archaic and\r\n non-standard spelling and has been retained.",
