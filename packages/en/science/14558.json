An error as to the differently-coloured herds of cattle in the\r\nFalkland Islands, is corrected.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PARKSTONE, DORSET\r\n    _August, 1889_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO FIRST EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present work treats the problem of the Origin of Species on the same\r\ngeneral lines as were adopted by Darwin; but from the standpoint reached\r\nafter nearly thirty years of discussion, with an abundance of new facts\r\nand the advocacy of many new or old theories.\r\n\r\nWhile not attempting to deal, even in outline, with the vast subject of\r\nevolution in general, an endeavour has been made to give such an account\r\nof the theory of Natural Selection as may enable any intelligent reader\r\nto obtain a clear conception of Darwin's work, and to understand\r\nsomething of the power and range of his great principle.\r\n\r\nDarwin wrote for a generation which had not accepted evolution, and\r\nwhich poured contempt on those who upheld the derivation of species from\r\nspecies by any natural law of descent. He did his work so well that\r\n\"descent with modification\" is now universally accepted as the order of\r\nnature in the organic world; and the rising generation of naturalists\r\ncan hardly realise the novelty of this idea, or that their fathers\r\nconsidered it a scientific heresy to be condemned rather than seriously\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\nThe objections now made to Darwin's theory apply, solely, to the\r\nparticular means by which the change of species has been brought about,\r\nnot to the fact of that change. The objectors seek to minimise the\r\nagency of natural selection and to subordinate it to laws of variation,\r\nof use and disuse, of intelligence, and of heredity. These views and\r\nobjections are urged with much force and more confidence, and for the\r\nmost part by the modern school of laboratory naturalists, to whom the\r\npeculiarities and distinctions of species, as such, their distribution\r\nand their affinities, have little interest as compared with the problems\r\nof histology and embryology, of physiology and morphology. Their work in\r\nthese departments is of the greatest interest and of the highest\r\nimportance, but it is not the kind of work which, by itself, enables one\r\nto form a sound judgment on the questions involved in the action of the\r\nlaw of natural selection. These rest mainly on the external and vital\r\nrelations of species to species in a state of nature--on what has been\r\nwell termed by Semper the \"physiology of organisms,\" rather than on the\r\nanatomy or physiology of organs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt has always been considered a weakness in Darwin's work that he based\r\nhis theory, primarily, on the evidence of variation in domesticated\r\nanimals and cultivated plants. I have endeavoured to secure a firm\r\nfoundation for the theory in the variations of organisms in a state of\r\nnature; and as the exact amount and precise character of these\r\nvariations is of paramount importance in the numerous problems that\r\narise when we apply the theory to explain the facts of nature, I have\r\nendeavoured, by means of a series of diagrams, to exhibit to the eye the\r\nactual variations as they are found to exist in a sufficient number of\r\nspecies. By doing this, not only does the reader obtain a better and\r\nmore precise idea of variation than can be given by any number of\r\ntabular statements or cases of extreme individual variation, but we\r\nobtain a basis of fact by which to test the statements and objections\r\nusually put forth on the subject of specific variability; and it will be\r\nfound that, throughout the work, I have frequently to appeal to these\r\ndiagrams and the facts they illustrate, just as Darwin was accustomed to\r\nappeal to the facts of variation among dogs and pigeons.\r\n\r\nI have also made what appears to me an important change in the\r\narrangement of the subject. Instead of treating first the comparatively\r\ndifficult and unfamiliar details of variation, I commence with the\r\nStruggle for Existence, which is really the fundamental phenomenon on\r\nwhich natural selection depends, while the particular facts which\r\nillustrate it are comparatively familiar and very interesting. It has\r\nthe further advantage that, after discussing variation and the effects\r\nof artificial selection, we proceed at once to explain how natural\r\nselection acts.\r\n\r\nAmong the subjects of novelty or interest discussed in this volume, and\r\nwhich have important bearings on the theory of natural selection, are:\r\n(1) A proof that all _specific_ characters are (or once have been)\r\neither useful in themselves or correlated with useful characters (Chap.\r\nVI); (2) a proof that natural selection can, in certain cases, increase\r\nthe sterility of crosses (Chap. VII); (3) a fuller discussion of the\r\ncolour relations of animals, with additional facts and arguments on the\r\norigin of sexual differences of colour (Chaps. VIII-X); (4) an attempted\r\nsolution of the difficulty presented by the occurrence of both very\r\nsimple and very complex modes of securing the cross-fertilisation of\r\nplants (Chap. XI); (5) some fresh facts and arguments on the\r\nwind-carriage of seeds, and its bearing on the wide dispersal of many\r\narctic and alpine plants (Chap. XII); (6) some new illustrations of the\r\nnon-heredity of acquired characters, and a proof that the effects of use\r\nand disuse, even if inherited, must be overpowered by natural selection\r\n(Chap. XIV); and (7) a new argument as to the nature and origin of the\r\nmoral and intellectual faculties of man (Chap. XV).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough I maintain, and even enforce, my differences from some of\r\nDarwin's views, my whole work tends forcibly to illustrate the\r\noverwhelming importance of Natural Selection over all other agencies in\r\nthe production of new species. I thus take up Darwin's earlier\r\nposition, from which he somewhat receded in the later editions of his\r\nworks, on account of criticisms and objections which I have endeavoured\r\nto show are unsound. Even in rejecting that phase of sexual selection\r\ndepending on female choice, I insist on the greater efficacy of natural\r\nselection. This is pre-eminently the Darwinian doctrine, and I therefore\r\nclaim for my book the position of being the advocate of pure Darwinism.\r\n\r\nI wish to express my obligation to Mr. Francis Darwin for lending me\r\nsome of his father's unused notes, and to many other friends for facts\r\nor information, which have, I believe, been acknowledged either in the\r\ntext or footnotes. Mr. James Sime has kindly read over the proofs and\r\ngiven me many useful suggestions; and I have to thank Professor Meldola,\r\nMr. Hemsley, and Mr. E.B. Poulton for valuable notes or corrections in\r\nthe later chapters in which their special subjects are touched upon.\r\n\r\nGODALMING, _March 1889_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER

In order to appreciate fully the aim and object of\r\nthis work, and the change which it has effected not only in natural\r\nhistory but in many other sciences, it is necessary to form a clear\r\nconception of the meaning of the term \"species,\" to know what was the\r\ngeneral belief regarding them at the time when Mr. Darwin's book first\r\nappeared, and to understand what he meant, and what was generally meant,\r\nby discovering their \"origin.\" It is for want of this preliminary\r\nknowledge that the majority of educated persons who are not naturalists\r\nare so ready to accept the innumerable objections, criticisms, and\r\ndifficulties of its opponents as proofs that the Darwinian theory is\r\nunsound, while it also renders them unable to appreciate, or even to\r\ncomprehend, the vast change which that theory has effected in the whole\r\nmass of thought and opinion on the great question of evolution.\r\n\r\nThe term \"species\" was thus defined by the celebrated botanist De\r\nCandolle: \"A species is a collection of all the individuals which\r\nresemble each other more than they resemble anything else, which can by\r\nmutual fecundation produce fertile individuals, and which reproduce\r\nthemselves by generation, in such a manner that we may from analogy\r\nsuppose them all to have sprung from one single individual.\" And the\r\nzoologist Swainson gives a somewhat similar definition: \"A species, in\r\nthe usual acceptation of the term, is an animal which, in a state of\r\nnature, is distinguished by certain peculiarities of form, size, colour,\r\nor other circumstances, from another animal. It propagates, 'after its\r\nkind,' individuals perfectly resembling the parent; its peculiarities,\r\ntherefore, are permanent.\"[1]\r\n\r\nTo illustrate these definitions we will take two common English birds,\r\nthe rook (Corvus frugilegus) and the crow (Corvus corone). These are\r\ndistinct _species_, because, in the first place, they always differ from\r\neach other in certain slight peculiarities of structure, form, and\r\nhabits, and, in the second place, because rooks always produce rooks,\r\nand crows produce crows, and they do not interbreed. It was therefore\r\nconcluded that all the rooks in the world had descended from a single\r\npair of rooks, and the crows in like manner from a single pair of crows,\r\nwhile it was considered impossible that crows could have descended from\r\nrooks or _vice versâ_. The \"origin\" of the first pair of each kind was a\r\nmystery. Similar remarks may be applied to our two common plants, the\r\nsweet violet (Viola odorata) and the dog violet (Viola canina). These\r\nalso produce their like and never produce each other or intermingle, and\r\nthey were therefore each supposed to have sprung from a single\r\nindividual whose \"origin\" was unknown. But besides the crow and the rook\r\nthere are about thirty other kinds of birds in various parts of the\r\nworld, all so much like our species that they receive the common name of\r\ncrows; and some of them differ less from each other than does our crow\r\nfrom our rook. These are all _species_ of the genus Corvus, and were\r\ntherefore believed to have been always as distinct as they are now,\r\nneither more nor less, and to have each descended from one pair of\r\nancestral crows of the same identical species, which themselves had an\r\nunknown \"origin.\" Of violets there are more than a hundred different\r\nkinds in various parts of the world, all differing very slightly from\r\neach other and forming distinct _species_ of the genus Viola. But, as\r\nthese also each produce their like and do not intermingle, it was\r\nbelieved that every one of them had always been as distinct from all the\r\nothers as it is now, that all the individuals of each kind had descended\r\nfrom one ancestor, but that the \"origin\" of these hundred slightly\r\ndiffering ancestors was unknown. In the words of Sir John Herschel,\r\nquoted by Mr. Darwin, the origin of such species was \"the mystery of\r\nmysteries.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Early Transmutationists_.\r\n\r\nA few great naturalists, struck by the very slight difference between\r\nmany of these species, and the numerous links that exist between the\r\nmost different forms of animals and plants, and also observing that a\r\ngreat many species do vary considerably in their forms, colours, and\r\nhabits, conceived the idea that they might be all produced one from the\r\nother. The most eminent of these writers was a great French naturalist,\r\nLamarck, who published an elaborate work, the _Philosophie Zoologique_,\r\nin which he endeavoured to prove that all animals whatever are descended\r\nfrom other species of animals. He attributed the change of species\r\nchiefly to the effect of changes in the conditions of life--such as\r\nclimate, food, etc.--and especially to the desires and efforts of the\r\nanimals themselves to improve their condition, leading to a modification\r\nof form or size in certain parts, owing to the well-known physiological\r\nlaw that all organs are strengthened by constant use, while they are\r\nweakened or even completely lost by disuse. The arguments of Lamarck did\r\nnot, however, satisfy naturalists, and though a few adopted the view\r\nthat closely allied species had descended from each other, the general\r\nbelief of the educated public was, that each species was a \"special\r\ncreation\" quite independent of all others; while the great body of\r\nnaturalists equally held, that the change from one species to another by\r\nany known law or cause was impossible, and that the \"origin of species\"\r\nwas an unsolved and probably insoluble problem. The only other important\r\nwork dealing with the question was the celebrated _Vestiges of\r\nCreation_, published anonymously, but now acknowledged to have been\r\nwritten by the late Robert Chambers. In this work the action of general\r\nlaws was traced throughout the universe as a system of growth and\r\ndevelopment, and it was argued that the various species of animals and\r\nplants had been produced in orderly succession from each other by the\r\naction of unknown laws of development aided by the action of external\r\nconditions. Although this work had a considerable effect in influencing\r\npublic opinion as to the extreme improbability of the doctrine of the\r\nindependent \"special creation\" of each species, it had little effect\r\nupon naturalists, because it made no attempt to grapple with the problem\r\nin detail, or to show in any single case how the allied species of a\r\ngenus could have arisen, and have preserved their numerous slight and\r\napparently purposeless differences from each other. No clue whatever was\r\nafforded to a law which should produce from any one species one or more\r\nslightly differing but yet permanently distinct species, nor was any\r\nreason given why such slight yet constant differences should exist at\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scientific Opinion before Darwin._\r\n\r\nIn order to show how little effect these writers had upon the public\r\nmind, I will quote a few passages from the writings of Sir Charles\r\nLyell, as representing the opinions of the most advanced thinkers in the\r\nperiod immediately preceding that of Darwin's work. When recapitulating\r\nthe facts and arguments in favour of the invariability and permanence of\r\nspecies, he says: \"The entire variation from the original type which any\r\ngiven kind of change can produce may usually be effected in a brief\r\nperiod of time, after which no further deviation can be obtained by\r\ncontinuing to alter the circumstances, though ever so gradually,\r\nindefinite divergence either in the way of improvement or deterioration\r\nbeing prevented, and the least possible excess beyond the defined limits\r\nbeing fatal to the existence of the individual.\" In another place he\r\nmaintains that \"varieties of some species may differ more than other\r\nspecies do from each other without shaking our confidence in the reality\r\nof species.\" He further adduces certain facts in geology as being, in\r\nhis opinion, \"fatal to the theory of progressive development,\" and he\r\nexplains the fact that there are so often distinct species in countries\r\nof similar climate and vegetation by \"special creations\" in each\r\ncountry; and these conclusions were arrived at after a careful study of\r\nLamarck's work, a full abstract of which is given in the earlier\r\neditions of the _Principles of Geology_.[2]\r\n\r\nProfessor Agassiz, one of the greatest naturalists of the last\r\ngeneration, went even further, and maintained not only that each species\r\nwas specially created, but that it was created in the proportions and in\r\nthe localities in which we now find it to exist. The following extract\r\nfrom his very instructive book on Lake Superior explains this view:\r\n\"There are in animals peculiar adaptations which are characteristic of\r\ntheir species, and which cannot be supposed to have arisen from\r\nsubordinate influences. Those which live in shoals cannot be supposed to\r\nhave been created in single pairs. Those which are made to be the food\r\nof others cannot have been created in the same proportions as those\r\nwhich live upon them. Those which are everywhere found in innumerable\r\nspecimens must have been introduced in numbers capable of maintaining\r\ntheir normal proportions to those which live isolated and are\r\ncomparatively and constantly fewer. For we know that this harmony in the\r\nnumerical proportions between animals is one of the great laws of\r\nnature. The circumstance that species occur within definite limits where\r\nno obstacles prevent their wider distribution leads to the further\r\ninference that these limits were assigned to them from the beginning,\r\nand so we should come to the final conclusion that the order which\r\nprevails throughout nature is intentional, that it is regulated by the\r\nlimits marked out on the first day of creation, and that it has been\r\nmaintained unchanged through ages with no other modifications than those\r\nwhich the higher intellectual powers of man enable him to impose on some\r\nfew animals more closely connected with him.\"[3]\r\n\r\nThese opinions of some of the most eminent and influential writers of\r\nthe pre-Darwinian age seem to us, now, either altogether obsolete or\r\npositively absurd; but they nevertheless exhibit the mental condition of\r\neven the most advanced section of scientific men on the problem of the\r\nnature and origin of species. They render it clear that,\r\nnotwithstanding the vast knowledge and ingenious reasoning of Lamarck,\r\nand the more general exposition of the subject by the author of the\r\n_Vestiges of Creation_, the first step had not been taken towards a\r\nsatisfactory explanation of the derivation of any one species from any\r\nother. Such eminent naturalists as Geoffroy Saint Hilaire, Dean Herbert,\r\nProfessor Grant, Von Buch, and some others, had expressed their belief\r\nthat species arose as simple varieties, and that the species of each\r\ngenus were all descended from a common ancestor; but none of them gave a\r\nclue as to the law or the method by which the change had been effected.\r\nThis was still \"the great mystery.\" As to the further question--how far\r\nthis common descent could be carried; whether distinct families, such as\r\ncrows and thrushes, could possibly have descended from each other; or,\r\nwhether all birds, including such widely distinct types as wrens,\r\neagles, ostriches, and ducks, could all be the modified descendants of a\r\ncommon ancestor; or, still further, whether mammalia, birds, reptiles,\r\nand fishes, could all have had a common origin;--these questions had\r\nhardly come up for discussion at all, for it was felt that, while the\r\nvery first step along the road of \"transmutation of species\" (as it was\r\nthen called) had not been made, it was quite useless to speculate as to\r\nhow far it might be possible to travel in the same direction, or where\r\nthe road would ultimately lead to.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Problem before Darwin_.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, then, that what was understood by the \"origin\" or the\r\n\"transmutation\" of species before Darwin's work appeared, was the\r\ncomparatively simple question whether the allied species of each genus\r\nhad or had not been derived from one another and, remotely, from some\r\ncommon ancestor, by the ordinary method of reproduction and by means of\r\nlaws and conditions still in action and capable of being thoroughly\r\ninvestigated. If any naturalist had been asked at that day whether,\r\nsupposing it to be clearly shown that all the different species of each\r\ngenus had been derived from some one ancestral species, and that a full\r\nand complete explanation were to be given of how each minute difference\r\nin form, colour, or structure might have originated, and how the\r\nseveral peculiarities of habit and of geographical distribution might\r\nhave been brought about--whether, if this were done, the \"origin of\r\nspecies\" would be discovered, the great mystery solved, he would\r\nundoubtedly have replied in the affirmative. He would probably have\r\nadded that he never expected any such marvellous discovery to be made in\r\nhis lifetime. But so much as this assuredly Mr. Darwin has done, not\r\nonly in the opinion of his disciples and admirers, but by the admissions\r\nof those who doubt the completeness of his explanations. For almost all\r\ntheir objections and difficulties apply to those larger differences\r\nwhich separate genera, families, and orders from each other, not to\r\nthose which separate one species from the species to which it is most\r\nnearly allied, and from the remaining species of the same genus. They\r\nadduce such difficulties as the first development of the eye, or of the\r\nmilk-producing glands of the mammalia; the wonderful instincts of bees\r\nand of ants; the complex arrangements for the fertilisation of orchids,\r\nand numerous other points of structure or habit, as not being\r\nsatisfactorily explained. But it is evident that these peculiarities had\r\ntheir origin at a very remote period of the earth's history, and no\r\ntheory, however complete, can do more than afford a probable conjecture\r\nas to how they were produced. Our ignorance of the state of the earth's\r\nsurface and of the conditions of life at those remote periods is very\r\ngreat; thousands of animals and plants must have existed of which we\r\nhave no record; while we are usually without any information as to the\r\nhabits and general life-history even of those of which we possess some\r\nfragmentary remains; so that the truest and most complete theory would\r\nnot enable us to solve _all_ the difficult problems which the whole\r\ncourse of the development of life upon our globe presents to us.\r\n\r\nWhat we may expect a true theory to do is to enable us to comprehend and\r\nfollow out in some detail those changes in the form, structure, and\r\nrelations of animals and plants which are effected in short periods of\r\ntime, geologically speaking, and which are now going on around us. We\r\nmay expect it to explain satisfactorily most of the lesser and\r\nsuperficial differences which distinguish one species from another. We\r\nmay expect it to throw light on the mutual relations of the animals and\r\nplants which live together in any one country, and to give some rational\r\naccount of the phenomena presented by their distribution in different\r\nparts of the world. And, lastly, we may expect it to explain many\r\ndifficulties and to harmonise many incongruities in the excessively\r\ncomplex affinities and relations of living things. All this the\r\nDarwinian theory undoubtedly does. It shows us how, by means of some of\r\nthe most universal and ever-acting laws in nature, new species are\r\nnecessarily produced, while the old species become extinct; and it\r\nenables us to understand how the continuous action of these laws during\r\nthe long periods with which geology makes us acquainted is calculated to\r\nbring about those greater differences presented by the distinct genera,\r\nfamilies, and orders into which all living things are classified by\r\nnaturalists. The differences which these present are all of the same\r\n_nature_ as those presented by the species of many large genera, but\r\nmuch greater in _amount_; and they can all be explained by the action of\r\nthe same general laws and by the extinction of a larger or smaller\r\nnumber of intermediate species. Whether the distinctions between the\r\nhigher groups termed Classes and Sub-kingdoms may be accounted for in\r\nthe same way is a much more difficult question. The differences which\r\nseparate the mammals, birds, reptiles, and fishes from each other,\r\nthough vast, yet seem of the same nature as those which distinguish a\r\nmouse from an elephant or a swallow from a goose. But the vertebrate\r\nanimals, the mollusca, and the insects, are so radically distinct in\r\ntheir whole organisation and in the very plan of their structure, that\r\nobjectors may not unreasonably doubt whether they can all have been\r\nderived from a common ancestor by means of the very same laws as have\r\nsufficed for the differentiation of the various species of birds or of\r\nreptiles.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Change of Opinion effected by Darwin_.\r\n\r\nThe point I wish especially to urge is this. Before Darwin's work\r\nappeared, the great majority of naturalists, and almost without\r\nexception the whole literary and scientific world, held firmly to the\r\nbelief that _species_ were realities, and had not been derived from\r\nother species by any process accessible to us; the different species of\r\ncrow and of violet they are now, and to have originated by some totally\r\nunknown process so far removed from ordinary reproduction that it was\r\nusually spoken of as \"special creation.\" There was, then, no question of\r\nthe origin of families, orders, and classes, because the very first step\r\nof all, the \"origin of species,\" was believed to be an insoluble\r\nproblem. But now this is all changed. The whole scientific and literary\r\nworld, even the whole educated public, accepts, as a matter of common\r\nknowledge, the origin of species from other allied species by the\r\nordinary process of natural birth. The idea of special creation or any\r\naltogether exceptional mode of production is absolutely extinct! Yet\r\nmore: this is held also to apply to many higher groups as well as to the\r\nspecies of a genus, and not even Mr. Darwin's severest critics venture\r\nto suggest that the primeval bird, reptile, or fish must have been\r\n\"specially created.\" And this vast, this totally unprecedented change in\r\npublic opinion has been the result of the work of one man, and was\r\nbrought about in the short space of twenty years! This is the answer to\r\nthose who continue to maintain that the \"origin of species\" is not yet\r\ndiscovered; that there are still doubts and difficulties; that there are\r\ndivergencies of structure so great that we cannot understand how they\r\nhad their beginning. We may admit all this, just as we may admit that\r\nthere are enormous difficulties in the way of a complete comprehension\r\nof the origin and nature of all the parts of the solar system and of the\r\nstellar universe. But we claim for Darwin that he is the Newton of\r\nnatural history, and that, just so surely as that the discovery and\r\ndemonstration by Newton of the law of gravitation established order in\r\nplace of chaos and laid a sure foundation for all future study of the\r\nstarry heavens, so surely has Darwin, by his discovery of the law of\r\nnatural selection and his demonstration of the great principle of the\r\npreservation of useful variations in the struggle for life, not only\r\nthrown a flood of light on the process of development of the whole\r\norganic world, but also established a firm foundation for all future\r\nstudy of nature.\r\n\r\nIn order to show the view Darwin took of his own work, and what it was\r\nthat he alone claimed to have done, the concluding passage of the\r\nintroduction to the _Origin of_ _Species_ should be carefully\r\nconsidered. It is as follows: \"Although much remains obscure, and will\r\nlong remain obscure, I can entertain no doubt, after the most deliberate\r\nand dispassionate judgment of which I am capable, that the view which\r\nmost naturalists until recently entertained and which I formerly\r\nentertained--namely, that each species has been independently\r\ncreated--is erroneous. I am fully convinced that species are not\r\nimmutable; but that those belonging to what are called the same genera\r\nare lineal descendants of some other and generally extinct species, in\r\nthe same manner as the acknowledged varieties of any one species are the\r\ndescendants of that species. Furthermore, I am convinced that Natural\r\nSelection has been the most important, but not the exclusive, means of\r\nmodification.\"\r\n\r\nIt should be especially noted that all which is here claimed is now\r\nalmost universally admitted, while the criticisms of Darwin's works\r\nrefer almost exclusively to those numerous questions which, as he\r\nhimself says, \"will long remain obscure.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Darwinian Theory_.\r\n\r\nAs it will be necessary, in the following chapters, to set forth a\r\nconsiderable body of facts in almost every department of natural\r\nhistory, in order to establish the fundamental propositions on which the\r\ntheory of natural selection rests, I propose to give a preliminary\r\nstatement of what the theory really is, in order that the reader may\r\nbetter appreciate the necessity for discussing so many details, and may\r\nthus feel a more enlightened interest in them. Many of the facts to be\r\nadduced are so novel and so curious that they are sure to be appreciated\r\nby every one who takes an interest in nature, but unless the need of\r\nthem is clearly seen it may be thought that time is being wasted on mere\r\ncurious details and strange facts which have little bearing on the\r\nquestion at issue.\r\n\r\nThe theory of natural selection rests on two main classes of facts which\r\napply to all organised beings without exception, and which thus take\r\nrank as fundamental principles or laws. The first is, the power of rapid\r\nmultiplication in a geometrical progression; the second, that the\r\noffspring always vary slightly from the parents, though generally very\r\nclosely resembling them. From the first fact or law there follows,\r\nnecessarily, a constant struggle for existence; because, while the\r\noffspring always exceed the parents in number, generally to an enormous\r\nextent, yet the total number of living organisms in the world does not,\r\nand cannot, increase year by year. Consequently every year, on the\r\naverage, as many die as are born, plants as well as animals; and the\r\nmajority die premature deaths. They kill each other in a thousand\r\ndifferent ways; they starve each other by some consuming the food that\r\nothers want; they are destroyed largely by the powers of nature--by cold\r\nand heat, by rain and storm, by flood and fire. There is thus a\r\nperpetual struggle among them which shall live and which shall die; and\r\nthis struggle is tremendously severe, because so few can possibly remain\r\nalive--one in five, one in ten, often only one in a hundred or even one\r\nin a thousand.\r\n\r\nThen comes the question, Why do some live rather than others? If all the\r\nindividuals of each species were exactly alike in every respect, we\r\ncould only say it is a matter of chance. But they are not alike. We find\r\nthat they vary in many different ways. Some are stronger, some swifter,\r\nsome hardier in constitution, some more cunning. An obscure colour may\r\nrender concealment more easy for some, keener sight may enable others to\r\ndiscover prey or escape from an enemy better than their fellows. Among\r\nplants the smallest differences may be useful or the reverse. The\r\nearliest and strongest shoots may escape the slug; their greater vigour\r\nmay enable them to flower and seed earlier in a wet autumn; plants best\r\narmed with spines or hairs may escape being devoured; those whose\r\nflowers are most conspicuous may be soonest fertilised by insects. We\r\ncannot doubt that, on the whole, any beneficial variations will give the\r\npossessors of it a greater probability of living through the tremendous\r\nordeal they have to undergo. There may be something left to chance, but\r\non the whole _the fittest will survive_.\r\n\r\nThen we have another important fact to consider, the principle of\r\nheredity or transmission of variations. If we grow plants from seed or\r\nbreed any kind of animals year after year, consuming or giving away all\r\nthe increase we do not wish to keep just as they come to hand, our\r\nplants or animals will continue much the same; but if every year we\r\ncarefully save the best seed to sow and the finest or brightest\r\ncoloured animals to breed from, we shall soon find that an improvement\r\nwill take place, and that the average quality of our stock will be\r\nraised. This is the way in which all our fine garden fruits and\r\nvegetables and flowers have been produced, as well as all our splendid\r\nbreeds of domestic animals; and they have thus become in many cases so\r\ndifferent from the wild races from which they originally sprang as to be\r\nhardly recognisable as the same. It is therefore proved that if any\r\nparticular kind of variation is preserved and bred from, the variation\r\nitself goes on increasing in amount to an enormous extent; and the\r\nbearing of this on the question of the origin of species is most\r\nimportant. For if in each generation of a given animal or plant the\r\nfittest survive to continue the breed, then whatever may be the special\r\npeculiarity that causes \"fitness\" in the particular case, that\r\npeculiarity will go on increasing and strengthening _so long as it is\r\nuseful to the species_. But the moment it has reached its maximum of\r\nusefulness, and some other quality or modification would help in the\r\nstruggle, then the individuals which vary in the new direction will\r\nsurvive; and thus a species may be gradually modified, first in one\r\ndirection, then in another, till it differs from the original parent\r\nform as much as the greyhound differs from any wild dog or the\r\ncauliflower from any wild plant. But animals or plants which thus differ\r\nin a state of nature are always classed as distinct species, and thus we\r\nsee how, by the continuous survival of the fittest or the preservation\r\nof favoured races in the struggle for life, new species may be\r\noriginated.\r\n\r\nThis self-acting process which, by means of a few easily demonstrated\r\ngroups of facts, brings about change in the organic world, and keeps\r\neach species in harmony with the conditions of its existence, will\r\nappear to some persons so clear and simple as to need no further\r\ndemonstration. But to the great majority of naturalists and men of\r\nscience endless difficulties and objections arise, owing to the\r\nwonderful variety of animal and vegetable forms, and the intricate\r\nrelations of the different species and groups of species with each\r\nother; and it was to answer as many of these objections as possible, and\r\nto show that the more we know of nature the more we find it to\r\nharmonise with the development hypothesis, that Darwin devoted the whole\r\nof his life to collecting facts and making experiments, the record of a\r\nportion of which he has given us in a series of twelve masterly volumes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Proposed Mode of Treatment of the Subject_.\r\n\r\nIt is evidently of the most vital importance to any theory that its\r\nfoundations should be absolutely secure. It is therefore necessary to\r\nshow, by a wide and comprehensive array of facts, that animals and\r\nplants _do_ perpetually vary in the manner and to the amount requisite;\r\nand that this takes place in wild animals as well as in those which are\r\ndomesticated. It is necessary also to prove that all organisms _do_ tend\r\nto increase at the great rate alleged, and that this increase actually\r\noccurs, under favourable conditions. We have to prove, further, that\r\nvariations of all kinds can be increased and accumulated by selection;\r\nand that the struggle for existence to the extent here indicated\r\nactually occurs in nature, and leads to the continued preservation of\r\nfavourable variations.\r\n\r\nThese matters will be discussed in the four succeeding chapters, though\r\nin a somewhat different order--the struggle for existence and the power\r\nof rapid multiplication, which is its cause, occupying the first place,\r\nas comprising those facts which are the most fundamental and those which\r\ncan be perfectly explained without any reference to the less generally\r\nunderstood facts of variation. These chapters will be followed by a\r\ndiscussion of certain difficulties, and of the vexed question of\r\nhybridity. Then will come a rather full account of the more important of\r\nthe complex relations of organisms to each other and to the earth\r\nitself, which are either fully explained or greatly elucidated by the\r\ntheory. The concluding chapter will treat of the origin of man and his\r\nrelations to the lower animals.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Geography and Classification of Animals_, p. 350.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: These expressions occur in Chapter IX. of the earlier\r\neditions (to the ninth) of the _Principles of Geology_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: L.

To most persons nature\r\nappears calm, orderly, and peaceful. They see the birds singing in the\r\ntrees, the insects hovering over the flowers, the squirrel climbing\r\namong the tree-tops, and all living things in the possession of health\r\nand vigour, and in the enjoyment of a sunny existence. But they do not\r\nsee, and hardly ever think of, the means by which this beauty and\r\nharmony and enjoyment is brought about. They do not see the constant and\r\ndaily search after food, the failure to obtain which means weakness or\r\ndeath; the constant effort to escape enemies; the ever-recurring\r\nstruggle against the forces of nature. This daily and hourly struggle,\r\nthis incessant warfare, is nevertheless the very means by which much of\r\nthe beauty and harmony and enjoyment in nature is produced, and also\r\naffords one of the most important elements in bringing about the origin\r\nof species. We must, therefore, devote some time to the consideration of\r\nits various aspects and of the many curious phenomena to which it gives\r\nrise.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of common observation that if weeds are allowed to grow\r\nunchecked in a garden they will soon destroy a number of the flowers.\r\nIt is not so commonly known that if a garden is left to become\r\naltogether wild, the weeds that first take possession of it, often\r\ncovering the whole surface of the ground with two or three different\r\nkinds, will themselves be supplanted by others, so that in a few years\r\nmany of the original flowers and of the earliest weeds may alike have\r\ndisappeared. This is one of the very simplest cases of the struggle for\r\nexistence, resulting in the successive displacement of one set of\r\nspecies by another; but the exact causes of this displacement are by no\r\nmeans of such a simple nature. All the plants concerned may be perfectly\r\nhardy, all may grow freely from seed, yet when left alone for a number\r\nof years, each set is in turn driven out by a succeeding set, till at\r\nthe end of a considerable period--a century or a few centuries\r\nperhaps--hardly one of the plants which first monopolised the ground\r\nwould be found there.\r\n\r\nAnother phenomenon of an analogous kind is presented by the different\r\nbehaviour of introduced wild plants or animals into countries apparently\r\nquite as well suited to them as those which they naturally inhabit.\r\nAgassiz, in his work on Lake Superior, states that the roadside weeds of\r\nthe northeastern United States, to the number of 130 species, are all\r\nEuropean, the native weeds having disappeared westwards; and in New\r\nZealand there are no less than 250 species of naturalised European\r\nplants, more than 100 species of which have spread widely over the\r\ncountry, often displacing the native vegetation. On the other hand, of\r\nthe many hundreds of hardy plants which produce seed freely in our\r\ngardens, very few ever run wild, and hardly any have become common. Even\r\nattempts to naturalise suitable plants usually fail; for A. de Candolle\r\nstates that several botanists of Paris, Geneva, and especially of\r\nMontpellier, have sown the seeds of many hundreds of species of hardy\r\nexotic plants in what appeared to be the most favourable situations, but\r\nthat, in hardly a single case, has any one of them become\r\nnaturalised.[4] Even a plant like the potato--so widely cultivated, so\r\nhardy, and so well adapted to spread by means of its many-eyed\r\ntubers--has not established itself in a wild state in any part of\r\nEurope. It would be thought that Australian plants would easily run\r\nwild in New Zealand. But Sir Joseph Hooker informs us that the late Mr.\r\nBidwell habitually scattered Australian seeds during his extensive\r\ntravels in New Zealand, yet only two or three Australian plants appear\r\nto have established themselves in that country, and these only in\r\ncultivated or newly moved soil.\r\n\r\nThese few illustrations sufficiently show that all the plants of a\r\ncountry are, as De Candolle says, at war with each other, each one\r\nstruggling to occupy ground at the expense of its neighbour. But,\r\nbesides this direct competition, there is one not less powerful arising\r\nfrom the exposure of almost all plants to destruction by animals. The\r\nbuds are destroyed by birds, the leaves by caterpillars, the seeds by\r\nweevils; some insects bore into the trunk, others burrow in the twigs\r\nand leaves; slugs devour the young seedlings and the tender shoots,\r\nwire-worms gnaw the roots. Herbivorous mammals devour many species\r\nbodily, while some uproot and devour the buried tubers.\r\n\r\nIn animals, it is the eggs or the very young that suffer most from their\r\nvarious enemies; in plants, the tender seedlings when they first appear\r\nabove the ground. To illustrate this latter point Mr. Darwin cleared and\r\ndug a piece of ground three feet long and two feet wide, and then marked\r\nall the seedlings of weeds and other plants which came up, noting what\r\nbecame of them. The total number was 357, and out of these no less than\r\n295 were destroyed by slugs and insects. The direct strife of plant with\r\nplant is almost equally fatal when the stronger are allowed to smother\r\nthe weaker. When turf is mown or closely browsed by animals, a number of\r\nstrong and weak plants live together, because none are allowed to grow\r\nmuch beyond the rest; but Mr. Darwin found that when the plants which\r\ncompose such turf are allowed to grow up freely, the stronger kill the\r\nweaker. In a plot of turf three feet by four, twenty distinct species of\r\nplants were found to be growing, and no less than nine of these perished\r\naltogether when the other species were allowed to grow up to their full\r\nsize.[5]\r\n\r\nBut besides having to protect themselves against competing plants and\r\nagainst destructive animals, there is a yet deadlier enemy in the\r\nforces of inorganic nature. Each species can sustain a certain amount of\r\nheat and cold, each requires a certain amount of moisture at the right\r\nseason, each wants a proper amount of light or of direct sunshine, each\r\nneeds certain elements in the soil; the failure of a due proportion in\r\nthese inorganic conditions causes weakness, and thus leads to speedy\r\ndeath. The struggle for existence in plants is, therefore, threefold in\r\ncharacter and infinite in complexity, and the result is seen in their\r\ncuriously irregular distribution over the face of the earth. Not only\r\nhas each country its distinct plants, but every valley, every hillside,\r\nalmost every hedgerow, has a different set of plants from its adjacent\r\nvalley, hillside, or hedgerow--if not always different in the actual\r\nspecies yet very different in comparative abundance, some which are rare\r\nin the one being common in the other. Hence it happens that slight\r\nchanges of conditions often produce great changes in the flora of a\r\ncountry. Thus in 1740 and the two following years the larva of a moth\r\n(Phalaena graminis) committed such destruction in many of the meadows of\r\nSweden that the grass was greatly diminished in quantity, and many\r\nplants which were before choked by the grass sprang up, and the ground\r\nbecame variegated with a multitude of different species of flowers. The\r\nintroduction of goats into the island of St. Helena led to the entire\r\ndestruction of the native forests, consisting of about a hundred\r\ndistinct species of trees and shrubs, the young plants being devoured by\r\nthe goats as fast as they grew up. The camel is a still greater enemy to\r\nwoody vegetation than the goat, and Mr. Marsh believes that forests\r\nwould soon cover considerable tracts of the Arabian and African deserts\r\nif the goat and the camel were removed from them.[6] Even in many parts\r\nof our own country the existence of trees is dependent on the absence of\r\ncattle. Mr. Darwin observed, on some extensive heaths near Farnham, in\r\nSurrey, a few clumps of old Scotch firs, but no young trees over\r\nhundreds of acres. Some portions of the heath had, however, been\r\nenclosed a few years before, and these enclosures were crowded with\r\nyoung fir-trees growing too close together for all to live; and these\r\nwere not sown or planted, nothing having been done to the ground beyond\r\nenclosing it so as to keep out cattle. On ascertaining this, Mr. Darwin\r\nwas so much surprised that he searched among the heather in the\r\nunenclosed parts, and there he found multitudes of little trees and\r\nseedlings which had been perpetually browsed down by the cattle. In one\r\nsquare yard, at a point about a hundred yards from one of the old clumps\r\nof firs, he counted thirty-two little trees, and one of them had\r\ntwenty-six rings of growth, showing that it had for many years tried to\r\nraise its head above the stems of the heather and had failed. Yet this\r\nheath was very extensive and very barren, and, as Mr. Darwin remarks, no\r\none would ever have imagined that cattle would have so closely and so\r\neffectually searched it for food.\r\n\r\nIn the case of animals, the competition and struggle are more obvious.\r\nThe vegetation of a given district can only support a certain number of\r\nanimals, and the different kinds of plant-eaters will compete together\r\nfor it. They will also have insects for their competitors, and these\r\ninsects will be kept down by birds, which will thus assist the mammalia.\r\nBut there will also be carnivora destroying the herbivora; while small\r\nrodents, like the lemming and some of the field-mice, often destroy so\r\nmuch vegetation as materially to affect the food of all the other groups\r\nof animals. Droughts, floods, severe winters, storms and hurricanes will\r\ninjure these in various degrees, but no one species can be diminished in\r\nnumbers without the effect being felt in various complex ways by all the\r\nrest. A few illustrations of this reciprocal action must be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Illustrative Cases of the Struggle for Life_.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell observes that if, by the attacks of seals or other\r\nmarine foes, salmon are reduced in numbers, the consequence will be that\r\notters, living far inland, will be deprived of food and will then\r\ndestroy many young birds or quadrupeds, so that the increase of a marine\r\nanimal may cause the destruction of many land animals hundreds of miles\r\naway. Mr. Darwin carefully observed the effects produced by planting a\r\nfew hundred acres of Scotch fir, in Staffordshire, on part of a very\r\nextensive heath which had never been cultivated. After the planted\r\nportion was about twenty-five years old he observed that the change in\r\nthe native vegetation was greater than is often seen in passing from\r\none quite different soil to another. Besides a great change in the\r\nproportional numbers of the native heath-plants, twelve species which\r\ncould not be found on the heath flourished in the plantations. The\r\neffect on the insect life must have been still greater, for six\r\ninsectivorous birds which were very common in the plantations were not\r\nto be seen on the heath, which was, however, frequented by two or three\r\ndifferent species of insectivorous birds. It would have required\r\ncontinued study for several years to determine all the differences in\r\nthe organic life of the two areas, but the facts stated by Mr. Darwin\r\nare sufficient to show how great a change may be effected by the\r\nintroduction of a single kind of tree and the keeping out of cattle.\r\n\r\nThe next case I will give in Mr. Darwin's own words: \"In several parts\r\nof the world insects determine the existence of cattle. Perhaps Paraguay\r\noffers the most curious instance of this; for here neither cattle nor\r\nhorses nor dogs have ever run wild, though they swarm southward and\r\nnorthward in a feral state; and Azara and Rengger have shown that this\r\nis caused by the greater numbers, in Paraguay, of a certain fly which\r\nlays its eggs in the navels of these animals when first born. The\r\nincrease of these flies, numerous as they are, must be habitually\r\nchecked by some means, probably by other parasitic insects. Hence, if\r\ncertain insectivorous birds were to decrease in Paraguay, the parasitic\r\ninsects would probably increase; and this would lessen the number of the\r\nnavel-frequenting flies--then cattle and horses would become feral, and\r\nthis would greatly alter (as indeed I have observed in parts of South\r\nAmerica) the vegetation: this again would largely affect the insects,\r\nand this, as we have just seen in Staffordshire, the insectivorous\r\nbirds, and so onward in ever-increasing circles of complexity. Not that\r\nunder nature the relations will ever be as simple as this. Battle within\r\nbattle must be continually recurring with varying success; and yet in\r\nthe long run the forces are so nicely balanced, that the face of nature\r\nremains for a long time uniform, though assuredly the merest trifle\r\nwould give the victory to one organic being over another.\"[7]\r\n\r\nSuch cases as the above may perhaps be thought exceptional, but there\r\nis good reason to believe that they are by no means rare, but are\r\nillustrations of what is going on in every part of the world, only it is\r\nvery difficult for us to trace out the complex reactions that are\r\neverywhere occurring. The general impression of the ordinary observer\r\nseems to be that wild animals and plants live peaceful lives and have\r\nfew troubles, each being exactly suited to its place and surroundings,\r\nand therefore having no difficulty in maintaining itself. Before showing\r\nthat this view is, everywhere and always, demonstrably untrue, we will\r\nconsider one other case of the complex relations of distinct organisms\r\nadduced by Mr. Darwin, and often quoted for its striking and almost\r\neccentric character. It is now well known that many flowers require to\r\nbe fertilised by insects in order to produce seed, and this\r\nfertilisation can, in some cases, only be effected by one particular\r\nspecies of insect to which the flower has become specially adapted. Two\r\nof our common plants, the wild heart's-ease (Viola tricolor) and the red\r\nclover (Trifolium pratense), are thus fertilised by humble-bees almost\r\nexclusively, and if these insects are prevented from visiting the\r\nflowers, they produce either no seed at all or exceedingly few. Now it\r\nis known that field-mice destroy the combs and nests of humble-bees, and\r\nColonel Newman, who has paid great attention to these insects, believes\r\nthat more than two-thirds of all the humble-bees' nests in England are\r\nthus destroyed. But the number of mice depends a good deal on the number\r\nof cats; and the same observer says that near villages and towns he has\r\nfound the nests of humble-bees more numerous than elsewhere, which he\r\nattributes to the number of cats that destroy the mice. Hence it\r\nfollows, that the abundance of red clover and wild heart's-ease in a\r\ndistrict will depend on a good supply of cats to kill the mice, which\r\nwould otherwise destroy and keep down the humble-bees and prevent them\r\nfrom fertilising the flowers. A chain of connection has thus been found\r\nbetween such totally distinct organisms as flesh-eating mammalia and\r\nsweet-smelling flowers, the abundance or scarcity of the one closely\r\ncorresponding to that of the other!\r\n\r\nThe following account of the struggle between trees in the forests of\r\nDenmark, from the researches of M. Hansten-Blangsted, strikingly\r\nillustrates our subject.[8] The chief combatants are the beech and the\r\nbirch, the former being everywhere successful in its invasions. Forests\r\ncomposed wholly of birch are now only found in sterile, sandy tracts;\r\neverywhere else the trees are mixed, and wherever the soil is favourable\r\nthe beech rapidly drives out the birch. The latter loses its branches at\r\nthe touch of the beech, and devotes all its strength to the upper part\r\nwhere it towers above the beech. It may live long in this way, but it\r\nsuccumbs ultimately in the fight--of old age if of nothing else, for the\r\nlife of the birch in Denmark is shorter than that of the beech. The\r\nwriter believes that light (or rather shade) is the cause of the\r\nsuperiority of the latter, for it has a greater development of its\r\nbranches than the birch, which is more open and thus allows the rays of\r\nthe sun to pass through to the soil below, while the tufted, bushy top\r\nof the beech preserves a deep shade at its base. Hardly any young plants\r\ncan grow under the beech except its own shoots; and while the beech can\r\nnourish under the shade of the birch, the latter dies immediately under\r\nthe beech. The birch has only been saved from total extermination by the\r\nfacts that it had possession of the Danish forests long before the beech\r\never reached the country, and that certain districts are unfavourable to\r\nthe growth of the latter. But wherever the soil has been enriched by the\r\ndecomposition of the leaves of the birch the battle begins. The birch\r\nstill flourishes on the borders of lakes and other marshy places, where\r\nits enemy cannot exist. In the same way, in the forests of Zeeland, the\r\nfir forests are disappearing before the beech. Left to themselves, the\r\nfirs are soon displaced by the beech. The struggle between the latter\r\nand the oak is longer and more stubborn, for the branches and foliage of\r\nthe oak are thicker, and offer much resistance to the passage of light.\r\nThe oak, also, has greater longevity; but, sooner or later, it too\r\nsuccumbs, because it cannot develop in the shadow of the beech. The\r\nearliest forests of Denmark were mainly composed of aspens, with which\r\nthe birch was apparently associated; gradually the soil was raised, and\r\nthe climate grew milder; then the fir came and formed large forests.\r\nThis tree ruled for centuries, and then ceded the first place to the\r\nholm-oak, which is now giving way to the beech. Aspen, birch, fir, oak,\r\nand beech appear to be the steps in the struggle for the survival of the\r\nfittest among the forest-trees of Denmark.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that in the time of the Romans the beech was the\r\nprincipal forest-tree of Denmark as it is now, while in the much earlier\r\nbronze age, represented by the later remains found in the peat bogs,\r\nthere were no beech-trees, or very few, the oak being the prevailing\r\ntree, while in the still earlier stone period the fir was the most\r\nabundant. The beech is a tree essentially of the temperate zone, having\r\nits northern limit considerably southward of the oak, fir, birch, or\r\naspen, and its entrance into Denmark was no doubt due to the\r\namelioration of the climate after the glacial epoch had entirely passed\r\naway. We thus see how changes of climate, which are continually\r\noccurring owing either to cosmical or geographical causes, may initiate\r\na struggle among plants which may continue for thousands of years, and\r\nwhich must profoundly modify the relations of the animal world, since\r\nthe very existence of innumerable insects, and even of many birds and\r\nmammals, is dependent more or less completely on certain species of\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Struggle for Existence on the Pampas_.\r\n\r\nAnother illustration of the struggle for existence, in which both plants\r\nand animals are implicated, is afforded by the pampas of the southern\r\npart of South America. The absence of trees from these vast plains has\r\nbeen imputed by Mr. Darwin to the supposed inability of the tropical and\r\nsub-tropical forms of South America to thrive on them, and there being\r\nno other source from which they could obtain a supply; and that\r\nexplanation was adopted by such eminent botanists as Mr. Ball and\r\nProfessor Asa Gray. This explanation has always seemed to me\r\nunsatisfactory, because there are ample forests both in the temperate\r\nregions of the Andes and on the whole west coast down to Terra del\r\nFuego; and it is inconsistent with what we know of the rapid variation\r\nand adaptation of species to new conditions. What seems a more\r\nsatisfactory explanation has been given by Mr. Edwin Clark, a civil\r\nengineer, who resided nearly two years in the country and paid much\r\nattention to its natural history. He says: \"The peculiar characteristics\r\nof these vast level plains which descend from the Andes to the great\r\nriver basin in unbroken monotony, are the absence of rivers or\r\nwater-storage, and the periodical occurrence of droughts, or 'siccos,'\r\nin the summer months. These conditions determine the singular character\r\nboth of its flora and fauna.\r\n\r\n\"The soil is naturally fertile and favourable for the growth of trees,\r\nand they grow luxuriantly wherever they are protected. The eucalyptus is\r\ncovering large tracts wherever it is enclosed, and willows, poplars, and\r\nthe fig surround every estancia when fenced in.\r\n\r\n\"The open plains are covered with droves of horses and cattle, and\r\noverrun by numberless wild rodents, the original tenants of the pampas.\r\nDuring the long periods of drought, which are so great a scourge to the\r\ncountry, these animals are starved by thousands, destroying, in their\r\nefforts to live, every vestige of vegetation. In one of these 'siccos,'\r\nat the time of my visit, no less than 50,000 head of oxen and sheep and\r\nhorses perished from starvation and thirst, after tearing deep out of\r\nthe soil every trace of vegetation, including the wiry roots of the\r\npampas-grass. Under such circumstances the existence of an unprotected\r\ntree is impossible. The only plants that hold their own, in addition to\r\nthe indestructible thistles, grasses, and clover, are a little\r\nherbaceous oxalis, producing viviparous buds of extraordinary vitality,\r\na few poisonous species, such as the hemlock, and a few tough, thorny\r\ndwarf-acacias and wiry rushes, which even a starving rat refuses.\r\n\r\n\"Although the cattle are a modern introduction, the numberless\r\nindigenous rodents must always have effectually prevented the\r\nintroduction of any other species of plants; large tracts are still\r\nhoneycombed by the ubiquitous biscacho, a gigantic rabbit; and numerous\r\nother rodents still exist, including rats and mice, pampas-hares, and\r\nthe great nutria and carpincho (capybara) on the river banks.\"[9]\r\n\r\nMr. Clark further remarks on the desperate struggle for existence which\r\ncharacterises the bordering fertile zones, where rivers and marshy\r\nplains permit a more luxuriant and varied vegetable and animal life.\r\nAfter describing how the river sometimes rose 30 feet in eight hours,\r\ndoing immense destruction, and the abundance of the larger carnivora and\r\nlarge reptiles on its banks, he goes on: \"But it was among the flora\r\nthat the principle of natural selection was most prominently displayed.\r\nIn such a district--overrun with rodents and escaped cattle, subject to\r\nfloods that carried away whole islands of botany, and especially to\r\ndroughts that dried up the lakes and almost the river itself--no\r\nordinary plant could live, even on this rich and watered alluvial\r\ndebris. The only plants that escaped the cattle were such as were either\r\npoisonous, or thorny, or resinous, or indestructibly tough. Hence we had\r\nonly a great development of solanums, talas, acacias, euphorbias, and\r\nlaurels. The buttercup is replaced by the little poisonous yellow oxalis\r\nwith its viviparous buds; the passion-flowers, asclepiads, bignonias,\r\nconvolvuluses, and climbing leguminous plants escape both floods and\r\ncattle by climbing the highest trees and towering overhead in a flood of\r\nbloom. The ground plants are the portulacas, turneras, and cenotheras,\r\nbitter and ephemeral, on the bare rock, and almost independent of any\r\nother moisture than the heavy dews. The pontederias, alismas, and\r\nplantago, with grasses and sedges, derive protection from the deep and\r\nbrilliant pools; and though at first sight the 'monte' doubtless\r\nimpresses the traveller as a scene of the wildest confusion and ruin,\r\nyet, on closer examination, we found it far more remarkable as a\r\nmanifestation of harmony and law, and a striking example of the\r\nmarvellous power which plants, like animals, possess, of adapting\r\nthemselves to the local peculiarities of their habitat, whether in the\r\nfertile shades of the luxuriant 'monte' or on the arid, parched-up\r\nplains of the treeless pampas.\"\r\n\r\nA curious example of the struggle between plants has been communicated\r\nto me by Mr. John Ennis, a resident in New Zealand. The English\r\nwater-cress grows so luxuriantly in that country as to completely choke\r\nup the rivers, sometimes leading to disastrous floods, and necessitating\r\ngreat outlay to keep the stream open. But a natural remedy has now been\r\nfound in planting willows on the banks. The roots of these trees\r\npenetrate the bed of the stream in every direction, and the water-cress,\r\nunable to obtain the requisite amount of nourishment, gradually\r\ndisappears.\r\n\r\n_Increase of Organisms in a Geometrical Ratio_.\r\n\r\nThe facts which have now been adduced, sufficiently prove that there is\r\na continual competition, and struggle, and war going on in nature, and\r\nthat each species of animal and plant affects many others in complex and\r\noften unexpected ways. We will now proceed to show the fundamental cause\r\nof this struggle, and to prove that it is ever acting over the whole\r\nfield of nature, and that no single species of animal or plant can\r\npossibly escape from it. This results from the fact of the rapid\r\nincrease, in a geometrical ratio, of all the species of animals and\r\nplants. In the lower orders this increase is especially rapid, a single\r\nflesh-fly (Musca carnaria) producing 20,000 larvae, and these growing so\r\nquickly that they reach their full size in five days; hence the great\r\nSwedish naturalist, Linnaeus, asserted that a dead horse would be\r\ndevoured by three of these flies as quickly as by a lion. Each of these\r\nlarvae remains in the pupa state about five or six days, so that each\r\nparent fly may be increased ten thousand-fold in a fortnight. Supposing\r\nthey went on increasing at this rate during only three months of summer,\r\nthere would result one hundred millions of millions of millions for each\r\nfly at the commencement of summer,--a number greater probably than\r\nexists at any one time in the whole world. And this is only one species,\r\nwhile there are thousands of other species increasing also at an\r\nenormous rate; so that, if they were unchecked, the whole atmosphere\r\nwould be dense with flies, and all animal food and much of animal life\r\nwould be destroyed by them. To prevent this tremendous increase there\r\nmust be incessant war against these insects, by insectivorous birds and\r\nreptiles as well as by other insects, in the larva as well as in the\r\nperfect state, by the action of the elements in the form of rain, hail,\r\nor drought, and by other unknown causes; yet we see nothing of this\r\never-present war, though by its means alone, perhaps, we are saved from\r\nfamine and pestilence.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider a less extreme and more familiar case. We possess a\r\nconsiderable number of birds which, like the redbreast, sparrow, the\r\nfour common titmice, the thrush, and the blackbird, stay with us all the\r\nyear round These lay on an average six eggs, but, as several of them\r\nhave two or more broods a year, ten will be below the average of the\r\nyear's increase. Such birds as these often live from fifteen to twenty\r\nyears in confinement, and we cannot suppose them to live shorter lives\r\nin a state of nature, if unmolested; but to avoid possible exaggeration\r\nwe will take only ten years as the average duration of their lives. Now,\r\nif we start with a single pair, and these are allowed to live and breed,\r\nunmolested, till they die at the end of ten years,--as they might do if\r\nturned loose into a good-sized island with ample vegetable and insect\r\nfood, but no other competing or destructive birds or quadrupeds--their\r\nnumbers would amount to more than twenty millions. But we know very well\r\nthat our bird population is no greater, on the average, now than it was\r\nten years ago. Year by year it may fluctuate a little according as the\r\nwinters are more or less severe, or from other causes, but on the whole\r\nthere is no increase. What, then, becomes of the enormous surplus\r\npopulation annually produced? It is evident they must all die or be\r\nkilled, somehow; and as the increase is, on the average, about five to\r\none, it follows that, if the average number of birds of all kinds in our\r\nislands is taken at ten millions--and this is probably far under the\r\nmark--then about fifty millions of birds, including eggs as possible\r\nbirds, must annually die or be destroyed. Yet we see nothing, or almost\r\nnothing, of this tremendous slaughter of the innocents going on all\r\naround us. In severe winters a few birds are found dead, and a few\r\nfeathers or mangled remains show us where a wood-pigeon or some other\r\nbird has been destroyed by a hawk, but no one would imagine that five\r\ntimes as many birds as the total number in the country in early spring\r\ndie every year. No doubt a considerable proportion of these do not die\r\nhere but during or after migration to other countries, but others which\r\nare bred in distant countries come here, and thus balance the account.\r\nAgain, as the average number of young produced is four or five times\r\nthat of the parents, we ought to have at least five times as many birds\r\nin the country at the end of summer as at the beginning, and there is\r\ncertainly no such enormous disproportion as this. The fact is, that the\r\ndestruction commences, and is probably most severe, with nestling birds,\r\nwhich are often killed by heavy rains or blown away by severe storms, or\r\nleft to die of hunger if either of the parents is killed; while they\r\noffer a defenceless prey to jackdaws, jays, and magpies, and not a few\r\nare ejected from their nests by their foster-brothers the cuckoos. As\r\nsoon as they are fledged and begin to leave the nest great numbers are\r\ndestroyed by buzzards, sparrow-hawks, and shrikes. Of those which\r\nmigrate in autumn a considerable proportion are probably lost at sea or\r\notherwise destroyed before they reach a place of safety; while those\r\nwhich remain with us are greatly thinned by cold and starvation during\r\nsevere winters. Exactly the same thing goes on with every species of\r\nwild animal and plant from the lowest to the highest. All breed at such\r\na rate, that in a few years the progeny of any one species would, if\r\nallowed to increase unchecked, alone monopolise the land; but all alike\r\nare kept within bounds by various destructive agencies, so that, though\r\nthe numbers of each may fluctuate, they can never permanently increase\r\nexcept at the expense of some others, which must proportionately\r\ndecrease.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cases showing the Great Powers of Increase of Animals._\r\n\r\nAs the facts now stated are the very foundation of the theory we are\r\nconsidering, and the enormous increase and perpetual destruction\r\ncontinually going on require to be kept ever present in the mind, some\r\ndirect evidence of actual cases of increase must be adduced. That even\r\nthe larger animals, which breed comparatively slowly, increase\r\nenormously when placed under favourable conditions in new countries, is\r\nshown by the rapid spread of cattle and horses in America. Columbus, in\r\nhis second voyage, left a few black cattle at St. Domingo, and these ran\r\nwild and increased so much that, twenty-seven years afterwards, herds of\r\nfrom 4000 to 8000 head were not uncommon. Cattle were afterwards taken\r\nfrom this island to Mexico and to other parts of America, and in 1587,\r\nsixty-five years after the conquest of Mexico, the Spaniards exported\r\n64,350 hides from that country and 35,444 from St. Domingo, an\r\nindication of the vast numbers of these animals which must then have\r\nexisted there, since those captured and killed could have been only a\r\nsmall portion of the whole. In the pampas of Buenos Ayres there were, at\r\nthe end of the last century, about twelve million cows and three million\r\nhorses, besides great numbers in all other parts of America where open\r\npastures offered suitable conditions. Asses, about fifty years after\r\ntheir introduction, ran wild and multiplied so amazingly in Quito, that\r\nthe Spanish traveller Ulloa describes them as being a nuisance. They\r\ngrazed together in great herds, defending themselves with their mouths,\r\nand if a horse strayed among them they all fell upon him and did not\r\ncease biting and kicking till they left him dead. Hogs were turned out\r\nin St. Domingo by Columbus in 1493, and the Spaniards took them to other\r\nplaces where they settled, the result being, that in about half a\r\ncentury these animals were found in great numbers over a large part of\r\nAmerica, from 25° north to 40° south latitude. More recently, in New\r\nZealand, pigs have multiplied so greatly in a wild state as to be a\r\nserious nuisance and injury to agriculture. To give some idea of their\r\nnumbers, it is stated that in the province of Nelson there were killed\r\nin twenty months 25,000 wild pigs.[10] Now, in the case of all these\r\nanimals, we know that in their native countries, and even in America at\r\nthe present time, they do not increase at all in numbers; therefore the\r\nwhole normal increase must be kept down, year by year, by natural or\r\nartificial means of destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rapid Increase and Wide Spread of Plants_.\r\n\r\nIn the case of plants, the power of increase is even greater and its\r\neffects more distinctly visible. Hundreds of square miles of the plains\r\nof La Plata are now covered with two or three species of European\r\nthistle, often to the exclusion of almost every other plant; but in the\r\nnative countries of these thistles they occupy, except in cultivated or\r\nwaste ground, a very subordinate part in the vegetation. Some American\r\nplants, like the cotton-weed (Asclepias cuiussayica), have now become\r\ncommon weeds over a large portion of the tropics. White clover\r\n(Trifolium repens) spreads over all the temperate regions of the world,\r\nand in New Zealand is exterminating many native species, including even\r\nthe native flax (Phormium tenax), a large plant with iris-like leaves 5\r\nor 6 feet high. Mr. W.L. Travers has paid much attention to the effects\r\nof introduced plants in New Zealand, and notes the following species as\r\nbeing especially remarkable. The common knotgrass (Polygonum aviculare)\r\ngrows most luxuriantly, single plants covering a space 4 or 5 feet in\r\ndiameter, and sending their roots 3 or 4 feet deep. A large sub-aquatic\r\ndock (Rumex obtusifolius) abounds in every river-bed, even far up among\r\nthe mountains. The common sow-thistle (Sonchus oleraceus) grows all over\r\nthe country up to an elevation of 6000 feet. The water-cress (Nasturtium\r\nofficinale) grows with amazing vigour in many of the rivers, forming\r\nstems 12 feet long and 3/4 inch in diameter, and completely choking them\r\nup. It cost £300 a year to keep the Avon at Christchurch free from it.\r\nThe sorrel (Rumex acetosella) covers hundreds of acres with a sheet of\r\nred. It forms a dense mat, exterminating other plants, and preventing\r\ncultivation. It can, however, be itself exterminated by sowing the\r\nground with red clover, which will also vanquish the Polygonum\r\naviculare. The most noxious weed in New Zealand appears, however, to be\r\nthe Hypochaeris radicata, a coarse yellow-flowered composite not\r\nuncommon in our meadows and waste places. This has been introduced with\r\ngrass seeds from England, and is very destructive. It is stated that\r\nexcellent pasture was in three years destroyed by this weed, which\r\nabsolutely displaced every other plant on the ground. It grows in every\r\nkind of soil, and is said even to drive out the white clover, which is\r\nusually so powerful in taking possession of the soil.\r\n\r\nIn Australia another composite plant, called there the Cape-weed\r\n(Cryptostemma calendulaceum), did much damage, and was noticed by Baron\r\nVon Hugel in 1833 as \"an unexterminable weed\"; but, after forty years'\r\noccupation, it was found to give way to the dense herbage formed by\r\nlucerne and choice grasses.\r\n\r\nIn Ceylon we are told by Mr. Thwaites, in his _Enumeration of Ceylon\r\nPlants_, that a plant introduced into the island less than fifty years\r\nago is helping to alter the character of the vegetation up to an\r\nelevation of 3000 feet. This is the Lantana mixta, a verbenaceous plant\r\nintroduced from the West Indies, which appears to have found in Ceylon\r\na soil and climate exactly suited to it. It now covers thousands of\r\nacres with its dense masses of foliage, taking complete possession of\r\nland where cultivation has been neglected or abandoned, preventing the\r\ngrowth of any other plants, and even destroying small trees, the tops of\r\nwhich its subscandent stems are able to reach. The fruit of this plant\r\nis so acceptable to frugivorous birds of all kinds that, through their\r\ninstrumentality, it is spreading rapidly, to the complete exclusion of\r\nthe indigenous vegetation where it becomes established.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Great Fertility not essential to Rapid Increase_.\r\n\r\nThe not uncommon circumstance of slow-breeding animals being very\r\nnumerous, shows that it is usually the amount of destruction which an\r\nanimal or plant is exposed to, not its rapid multiplication, that\r\ndetermines its numbers in any country. The passenger-pigeon (Ectopistes\r\nmigratorius) is, or rather was, excessively abundant in a certain area\r\nin North America, and its enormous migrating flocks darkening the sky\r\nfor hours have often been described; yet this bird lays only two eggs.\r\nThe fulmar petrel exists in myriads at St. Kilda and other haunts of the\r\nspecies, yet it lays only one egg. On the other hand the great shrike,\r\nthe tree-creeper, the nut-hatch, the nut-cracker, the hoopoe, and many\r\nother birds, lay from four to six or seven eggs, and yet are never\r\nabundant. So in plants, the abundance of a species bears little or no\r\nrelation to its seed-producing power. Some of the grasses and sedges,\r\nthe wild hyacinth, and many buttercups occur in immense profusion over\r\nextensive areas, although each plant produces comparatively few seeds;\r\nwhile several species of bell-flowers, gentians, pinks, and mulleins,\r\nand even some of the composite, which produce an abundance of minute\r\nseeds, many of which are easily scattered by the wind, are yet rare\r\nspecies that never spread beyond a very limited area.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned passenger-pigeon affords such an excellent example\r\nof an enormous bird-population kept up by a comparatively slow rate of\r\nincrease, and in spite of its complete helplessness and the great\r\ndestruction which it suffers from its numerous enemies, that the\r\nfollowing account of one of its breeding-places and migrations by the\r\ncelebrated American naturalist, Alexander Wilson, will be read with\r\ninterest:--\r\n\r\n\"Not far from Shelbyville, in the State of Kentucky, about five years\r\nago, there was one of these breeding-places, which stretched through the\r\nwoods in nearly a north and south direction, was several miles in\r\nbreadth, and was said to be upwards of 40 miles in extent. In this tract\r\nalmost every tree was furnished with nests wherever the branches could\r\naccommodate them. The pigeons made their first appearance there about\r\nthe 10th of April, and left it altogether with their young before the\r\n25th of May. As soon as the young were fully grown and before they left\r\nthe nests, numerous parties of the inhabitants from all parts of the\r\nadjacent country came with waggons, axes, beds, cooking utensils, many\r\nof them accompanied by the greater part of their families, and encamped\r\nfor several days at this immense nursery. Several of them informed me\r\nthat the noise was so great as to terrify their horses, and that it was\r\ndifficult for one person to hear another without bawling in his ear. The\r\nground was strewed with broken limbs of trees, eggs, and young squab\r\npigeons, which had been precipitated from above, and on which herds of\r\nhogs were fattening. Hawks, buzzards, and eagles were sailing about in\r\ngreat numbers, and seizing the squabs from the nests at pleasure; while,\r\nfrom 20 feet upwards to the top of the trees, the view through the woods\r\npresented a perpetual tumult of crowding and fluttering multitudes of\r\npigeons, their wings roaring like thunder, mingled with the frequent\r\ncrash of falling timber; for now the axemen were at work cutting down\r\nthose trees that seemed most crowded with nests, and contrived to fell\r\nthem in such a manner, that in their descent they might bring down\r\nseveral others; by which means the falling of one large tree sometimes\r\nproduced 200 squabs little inferior in size to the old birds, and almost\r\none heap of fat. On some single trees upwards of a hundred nests were\r\nfound, each containing one squab only; a circumstance in the history of\r\nthe bird not generally known to naturalists.[11] It was dangerous to\r\nwalk under these flying and fluttering millions, from the frequent fall\r\nof large branches, broken down by the weight of the multitudes above,\r\nand which in their descent often destroyed numbers of the birds\r\nthemselves; while the clothes of those engaged in traversing the woods\r\nwere completely covered with the excrements of the pigeons.\r\n\r\n\"These circumstances were related to me by many of the most respectable\r\npart of the community in that quarter, and were confirmed in part by\r\nwhat I myself witnessed. I passed for several miles through this same\r\nbreeding-place, where every tree was spotted with nests, the remains of\r\nthose above described. In many instances I counted upwards of ninety\r\nnests on a single tree; but the pigeons had abandoned this place for\r\nanother, 60 or 80 miles off, towards Green River, where they were said\r\nat that time to be equally numerous. From the great numbers that were\r\nconstantly passing over our heads to or from that quarter, I had no\r\ndoubt of the truth of this statement. The mast had been chiefly consumed\r\nin Kentucky; and the pigeons, every morning a little before sunrise, set\r\nout for the Indiana territory, the nearest part of which was about sixty\r\nmiles distant. Many of these returned before ten o'clock, and the great\r\nbody generally appeared on their return a little after noon. I had left\r\nthe public road to visit the remains of the breeding-place near\r\nShelbyville, and was traversing the woods with my gun, on my way to\r\nFrankfort, when about ten o'clock the pigeons which I had observed\r\nflying the greater part of the morning northerly, began to return in\r\nsuch immense numbers as I never before had witnessed. Coming to an\r\nopening by the side of a creek, where I had a more uninterrupted view, I\r\nwas astonished at their appearance: they were flying with great\r\nsteadiness and rapidity, at a height beyond gunshot, in several strata\r\ndeep, and so close together that, could shot have reached them, one\r\ndischarge could not have failed to bring down several individuals. From\r\nright to left, as far as the eye could reach, the breadth of this vast\r\nprocession extended, seeming everywhere equally crowded. Curious to\r\ndetermine how long this appearance would continue, I took out my watch\r\nto note the time, and sat down to observe them. It was then half-past\r\none; I sat for more than an hour, but instead of a diminution of this\r\nprodigious procession, it seemed rather to increase, both in numbers and\r\nrapidity; and anxious to reach Frankfort before night, I rose and went\r\non. About four o'clock in the afternoon I crossed Kentucky River, at the\r\ntown of Frankfort, at which time the living torrent above my head seemed\r\nas numerous and as extensive as ever. Long after this I observed them in\r\nlarge bodies that continued to pass for six or eight minutes, and these\r\nagain were followed by other detached bodies, all moving in the same\r\nsouth-east direction, till after six o'clock in the evening. The great\r\nbreadth of front which this mighty multitude preserved would seem to\r\nintimate a corresponding breadth of their breeding-place, which, by\r\nseveral gentlemen who had lately passed through part of it, was stated\r\nto me at several miles.\"\r\n\r\nFrom these various observations, Wilson calculated that the number of\r\nbirds contained in the mass of pigeons which he saw on this occasion was\r\nat least two thousand millions, while this was only one of many similar\r\naggregations known to exist in various parts of the United States. The\r\npicture here given of these defenceless birds, and their still more\r\ndefenceless young, exposed to the attacks of numerous rapacious enemies,\r\nbrings vividly before us one of the phases of the unceasing struggle for\r\nexistence ever going on; but when we consider the slow rate of increase\r\nof these birds, and the enormous population they are nevertheless able\r\nto maintain, we must be convinced that in the case of the majority of\r\nbirds which multiply far more rapidly, and yet are never able to attain\r\nsuch numbers, the struggle against their numerous enemies and against\r\nthe adverse forces of nature must be even more severe or more\r\ncontinuous.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Struggle for Life between, closely allied Animals and Plants often the\r\nmost severe._\r\n\r\nThe struggle we have hitherto been considering has been mainly that\r\nbetween an animal or plant and its direct enemies, whether these enemies\r\nare other animals which devour it, or the forces of nature which destroy\r\nit. But there is another kind of struggle often going on at the same\r\ntime between closely related species, which almost always terminates in\r\nthe destruction of one of them. As an example of what is meant, Darwin\r\nstates that the recent increase of the missel-thrush in parts of\r\nScotland has caused the decrease of the song-thrush.[12] The black rat\r\n(Mus rattus) was the common rat of Europe till, in the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century, the large brown rat (Mus decumanus) appeared on the\r\nLower Volga, and thence spread more or less rapidly till it overran all\r\nEurope, and generally drove out the black rat, which in most parts is\r\nnow comparatively rare or quite extinct. This invading rat has now been\r\ncarried by commerce all over the world, and in New Zealand has\r\ncompletely extirpated a native rat, which the Maoris allege they brought\r\nwith them from their home in the Pacific; and in the same country a\r\nnative fly is being supplanted by the European house-fly. In Russia the\r\nsmall Asiatic cockroach has driven away a larger native species; and in\r\nAustralia the imported hive-bee is exterminating the small stingless\r\nnative bee.\r\n\r\nThe reason why this kind of struggle goes on is apparent if we consider\r\nthat the allied species fill nearly the same place in the economy of\r\nnature. They require nearly the same kind of food, are exposed to the\r\nsame enemies and the same dangers. Hence, if one has ever so slight an\r\nadvantage over the other in procuring food or in avoiding danger, in its\r\nrapidity of multiplication or its tenacity of life, it will increase\r\nmore rapidly, and by that very fact will cause the other to decrease and\r\noften become altogether extinct. In some cases, no doubt, there is\r\nactual war between the two, the stronger killing the weaker; but this is\r\nby no means necessary, and there may be cases in which the weaker\r\nspecies, physically, may prevail, by its power of more rapid\r\nmultiplication, its better withstanding vicissitudes of climates, or its\r\ngreater cunning in escaping the attacks of the common enemies. The same\r\nprinciple is seen at work in the fact that certain mountain varieties of\r\nsheep will starve out other mountain varieties, so that the two cannot\r\nbe kept together. In plants the same thing occurs. If several distinct\r\nvarieties of wheat are sown together, and the mixed seed resown, some of\r\nthe varieties which best suit the soil and climate, or are naturally the\r\nmost fertile, will beat the others and so yield more seed, and will\r\nconsequently in a few years supplant the other varieties.\r\n\r\nAs an effect of this principle, we seldom find closely allied species\r\nof animals or plants living together, but often in distinct though\r\nadjacent districts where the conditions of life are somewhat different.\r\nThus we may find cowslips (Primula veris) growing in a meadow, and\r\nprimroses (P. vulgaris) in an adjoining wood, each in abundance, but not\r\noften intermingled. And for the same reason the old turf of a pasture or\r\nheath consists of a great variety of plants matted together, so much so\r\nthat in a patch little more than a yard square Mr. Darwin found twenty\r\ndistinct species, belonging to eighteen distinct genera and to eight\r\nnatural orders, thus showing their extreme diversity of organisation.\r\nFor the same reason a number of distinct grasses and clovers are sown in\r\norder to make a good lawn instead of any one species; and the quantity\r\nof hay produced has been found to be greater from a variety of very\r\ndistinct grasses than from any one species of grass.\r\n\r\nIt may be thought that forests are an exception to this rule, since in\r\nthe north-temperate and arctic regions we find extensive forests of\r\npines or of oaks. But these are, after all, exceptional, and\r\ncharacterise those regions only where the climate is little favourable\r\nto forest vegetation. In the tropical and all the warm temperate parts\r\nof the earth, where there is a sufficient supply of moisture, the\r\nforests present the same variety of species as does the turf of our old\r\npastures; and in the equatorial virgin forests there is so great a\r\nvariety of forms, and they are so thoroughly intermingled, that the\r\ntraveller often finds it difficult to discover a second specimen of any\r\nparticular species which he has noticed. Even the forests of the\r\ntemperate zones, in all favourable situations, exhibit a considerable\r\nvariety of trees of distinct genera and families, and it is only when we\r\napproach the outskirts of forest vegetation, where either drought or\r\nwinds or the severity of the winter is adverse to the existence of most\r\ntrees, that we find extensive tracts monopolised by one or two species.\r\nEven Canada has more than sixty different forest trees and the Eastern\r\nUnited States a hundred and fifty; Europe is rather poor, containing\r\nabout eighty trees only; while the forests of Eastern Asia, Japan, and\r\nManchuria are exceedingly rich, about a hundred and seventy species\r\nbeing already known. And in all these countries the trees grow\r\nintermingled, so that in every extensive forest we have a considerable\r\nvariety, as may be seen in the few remnants of our primitive woods in\r\nsome parts of Epping Forest and the New Forest.\r\n\r\nAmong animals the same law prevails, though, owing to their constant\r\nmovements and power of concealment, it is not so readily observed. As\r\nillustrations we may refer to the wolf, ranging over Europe and Northern\r\nAsia, while the jackal inhabits Southern Asia and Northern Africa; the\r\ntree-porcupines, of which there are two closely allied species, one\r\ninhabiting the eastern, the other the western half of North America; the\r\ncommon hare (Lepus timidus) in Central and Southern Europe, while all\r\nNorthern Europe is inhabited by the variable hare (Lepus variabilis);\r\nthe common jay (Garrulus glandarius) inhabiting all Europe, while\r\nanother species (Garrulus Brandti) is found all across Asia from the\r\nUrals to Japan; and many species of birds in the Eastern United States\r\nare replaced by closely allied species in the west. Of course there are\r\nalso numbers of closely related species in the same country, but it will\r\nalmost always be found that they frequent different stations and have\r\nsomewhat different habits, and so do not come into direct competition\r\nwith each other; just as closely allied plants may inhabit the same\r\ndistricts, when one prefers meadows the other woods, one a chalky soil\r\nthe other sand, one a damp situation the other a dry one. With plants,\r\nfixed as they are to the earth, we easily note these peculiarities of\r\nstation; but with wild animals, which we see only on rare occasions, it\r\nrequires close and long-continued observation to detect the\r\npeculiarities in their mode of life which may prevent all direct\r\ncompetition between closely allied species dwelling in the same area.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Ethical Aspect of the Struggle for Existence_.\r\n\r\nOur exposition of the phenomena presented by the struggle for existence\r\nmay be fitly concluded by a few remarks on its ethical aspect. Now that\r\nthe war of nature is better known, it has been dwelt upon by many\r\nwriters as presenting so vast an amount of cruelty and pain as to be\r\nrevolting to our instincts of humanity, while it has proved a\r\nstumbling-block in the way of those who would fain believe in an\r\nall-wise and benevolent ruler of the universe. Thus, a brilliant writer\r\nsays: \"Pain, grief, disease, and death, are these the inventions of a\r\nloving God? That no animal shall rise to excellence except by being\r\nfatal to the life of others, is this the law of a kind Creator? It is\r\nuseless to say that pain has its benevolence, that massacre has its\r\nmercy. Why is it so ordained that bad should be the raw material of\r\ngood? Pain is not the less pain because it is useful; murder is not less\r\nmurder because it is conducive to development. Here is blood upon the\r\nhand still, and all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten it.\"[13]\r\n\r\nEven so thoughtful a writer as Professor Huxley adopts similar views. In\r\na recent article on \"The Struggle for Existence\" he speaks of the\r\nmyriads of generations of herbivorous animals which \"have been tormented\r\nand devoured by carnivores\"; of the carnivores and herbivores alike\r\n\"subject to all the miseries incidental to old age, disease, and\r\nover-multiplication\"; and of the \"more or less enduring suffering,\"\r\nwhich is the meed of both vanquished and victor. And he concludes that,\r\nsince thousands of times a minute, were our ears sharp enough, we should\r\nhear sighs and groans of pain like those heard by Dante at the gate of\r\nhell, the world cannot be governed by what we call benevolence.[14]\r\n\r\nNow there is, I think, good reason to believe that all this is greatly\r\nexaggerated; that the supposed \"torments\" and \"miseries\" of animals have\r\nlittle real existence, but are the reflection of the imagined sensations\r\nof cultivated men and women in similar circumstances; and that the\r\namount of actual suffering caused by the struggle for existence among\r\nanimals is altogether insignificant. Let us, therefore, endeavour to\r\nascertain what are the real facts on which these tremendous accusations\r\nare founded.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we must remember that animals are entirely spared\r\nthe pain we suffer in the anticipation of death--a pain far greater, in\r\nmost cases, than the reality. This leads, probably, to an almost\r\nperpetual enjoyment of their lives; since their constant watchfulness\r\nagainst danger, and even their actual flight from an enemy, will be the\r\nenjoyable exercise of the powers and faculties they possess, unmixed\r\nwith any serious dread. There is, in the next place, much evidence to\r\nshow that violent deaths, if not too prolonged, are painless and easy;\r\neven in the case of man, whose nervous system is in all probability much\r\nmore susceptible to pain than that of most animals. In all cases in\r\nwhich persons have escaped after being seized by a lion or tiger, they\r\ndeclare that they suffered little or no pain, physical or mental. A\r\nwell-known instance is that of Livingstone, who thus describes his\r\nsensations when seized by a lion: \"Starting and looking half round, I\r\nsaw the lion just in the act of springing on me. I was upon a little\r\nheight; he caught my shoulder as he sprang, and we both came to the\r\nground below together. Growling horribly close to my ear, he shook me as\r\na terrier-dog does a rat. The shock produced a stupor similar to that\r\nwhich seems to be felt by a mouse after the first shake of the cat. It\r\ncauses a sort of dreaminess, _in which there was no sense of pain or\r\nfeeling of terror_, though I was quite conscious of all that was\r\nhappening. It was like what patients partially under the influence of\r\nchloroform describe, who see all the operation, but feel not the knife.\r\nThis singular condition was not the result of any mental process. The\r\nshake annihilated fear, and allowed no sense of horror in looking round\r\nat the beast.\"\r\n\r\nThis absence of pain is not peculiar to those seized by wild beasts, but\r\nis equally produced by any accident which causes a general shock to the\r\nsystem. Mr. Whymper describes an accident to himself during one of his\r\npreliminary explorations of the Matterhorn, when he fell several hundred\r\nfeet, bounding from rock to rock, till fortunately embedded in a\r\nsnow-drift near the edge of a tremendous precipice. He declares that\r\nwhile falling and feeling blow after blow, he neither lost consciousness\r\nnor suffered pain, merely thinking, calmly, that a few more blows would\r\nfinish him. We have therefore a right to conclude, that when death\r\nfollows soon after any great shock it is as easy and painless a death as\r\npossible; and this is certainly what happens when an animal is seized by\r\na beast of prey. For the enemy is one which hunts for food, not for\r\npleasure or excitement; and it is doubtful whether any carnivorous\r\nanimal in a state of nature begins to seek after prey till driven to do\r\nso by hunger. When an animal is caught, therefore, it is very soon\r\ndevoured, and thus the first shock is followed by an almost painless\r\ndeath. Neither do those which die of cold or hunger suffer much. Cold is\r\ngenerally severest at night and has a tendency to produce sleep and\r\npainless extinction. Hunger, on the other hand, is hardly felt during\r\nperiods of excitement, and when food is scarce the excitement of seeking\r\nfor it is at its greatest. It is probable, also, that when hunger\r\npresses, most animals will devour anything to stay their hunger, and\r\nwill die of gradual exhaustion and weakness not necessarily painful, if\r\nthey do not fall an earlier prey to some enemy or to cold.[15]\r\n\r\nNow let us consider what are the enjoyments of the lives of most\r\nanimals. As a rule they come into existence at a time of year when food\r\nis most plentiful and the climate most suitable, that is in the spring\r\nof the temperate zone and at the commencement of the dry season in the\r\ntropics. They grow vigorously, being supplied with abundance of food;\r\nand when they reach maturity their lives are a continual round of\r\nhealthy excitement and exercise, alternating with complete repose. The\r\ndaily search for the daily food employs all their faculties and\r\nexercises every organ of their bodies, while this exercise leads to the\r\nsatisfaction of all their physical needs. In our own case, we can give\r\nno more perfect definition of happiness, than this exercise and this\r\nsatisfaction; and we must therefore conclude that animals, as a rule,\r\nenjoy all the happiness of which they are capable. And this normal state\r\nof happiness is not alloyed, as with us, by long periods--whole lives\r\noften--of poverty or ill-health, and of the unsatisfied longing for\r\npleasures which others enjoy but to which we cannot attain. Illness, and\r\nwhat answers to poverty in animals--continued hunger--are quickly\r\nfollowed by unanticipated and almost painless extinction. Where we err\r\nis, in giving to animals feelings and emotions which they do not\r\npossess. To us the very sight of blood and of torn or mangled limbs is\r\npainful, while the idea of the suffering implied by it is heartrending.\r\nWe have a horror of all violent and sudden death, because we think of\r\nthe life full of promise cut short, of hopes and expectations\r\nunfulfilled, and of the grief of mourning relatives. But all this is\r\nquite out of place in the case of animals, for whom a violent and a\r\nsudden death is in every way the best. Thus the poet's picture of\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Nature red in tooth and claw\r\n         With ravine\"\r\n\r\n\r\nis a picture the evil of which is read into it by our imaginations, the\r\nreality being made up of full and happy lives, usually terminated by the\r\nquickest and least painful of deaths.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, we conclude that the popular idea of the struggle\r\nfor existence entailing misery and pain on the animal world is the very\r\nreverse of the truth. What it really brings about, is, the maximum of\r\nlife and of the enjoyment of life with the minimum of suffering and\r\npain. Given the necessity of death and reproduction--and without these\r\nthere could have been no progressive development of the organic\r\nworld,--and it is difficult even to imagine a system by which a greater\r\nbalance of happiness could have been secured. And this view was\r\nevidently that of Darwin himself, who thus concludes his chapter on the\r\nstruggle for existence: \"When we reflect on this struggle, we may\r\nconsole ourselves with the full belief that the war of nature is not\r\nincessant, that no fear is felt, that death is generally prompt, and\r\nthat the vigorous, the healthy, and the happy survive and multiply.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Géographic Botanique_, p. 798.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _The Origin of Species_, p. 53.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _The Earth as Modified by Human Action_, p. 51.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: _The Origin of Species_, p. 56.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: See _Nature_, vol. xxxi. p. 63.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: _A Visit to South America_, 1878; also _Nature_, vol. xxxi.\r\npp. 263-339.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Still more remarkable is the increase of rabbits both in\r\nNew Zealand and Australia.

By the older naturalists,\r\nindeed, varieties--especially if numerous, small, and of frequent\r\noccurrence--were looked upon as an unmitigated nuisance, because they\r\nrendered it almost impossible to give precise definitions of species,\r\nthen considered the chief end of systematic natural history. Hence it\r\nwas the custom to describe what was supposed to be the \"typical form\" of\r\nspecies, and most collectors were satisfied if they possessed this\r\ntypical form in their cabinets. Now, however, a collection is valued in\r\nproportion as it contains illustrative specimens of all the varieties\r\nthat occur in each species, and in some cases these have been carefully\r\ndescribed, so that we possess a considerable mass of information on the\r\nsubject. Utilising this information we will now endeavour to give some\r\nidea of the nature and extent of variation in the species of animals and\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nIt is very commonly objected that the widespread and constant\r\nvariability which is admitted to be a characteristic of domesticated\r\nanimals and cultivated plants is largely due to the unnatural conditions\r\nof their existence, and that we have no proof of any corresponding\r\namount of variation occurring in a state of nature. Wild animals and\r\nplants, it is said, are usually stable, and when variations occur these\r\nare alleged to be small in amount and to affect superficial characters\r\nonly; or if larger and more important, to occur so rarely as not to\r\nafford any aid in the supposed formation of new species.\r\n\r\nThis objection, as will be shown, is utterly unfounded; but as it is one\r\nwhich goes to the very root of the problem, it is necessary to enter at\r\nsome length into the various proofs of variation in a state of nature.\r\nThis is the more necessary because the materials collected by Mr. Darwin\r\nbearing on this question have never been published, and comparatively\r\nfew of them have been cited in _The Origin of Species_; while a\r\nconsiderable body of facts has been made known since the publication of\r\nthe last edition of that work.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Variability of the Lower Animals_.\r\n\r\nAmong the lowest and most ancient marine organisms are the Foraminifera,\r\nlittle masses of living jelly, apparently structureless, but which\r\nsecrete beautiful shelly coverings, often perfectly symmetrical, as\r\nvaried in form as those of the mollusca and far more complicated. These\r\nhave been studied with great care by many eminent naturalists, and the\r\nlate Dr. W.B. Carpenter in his great work--the _Introduction to the\r\nStudy of the Foraminifera_--thus refers to their variability: \"There is\r\nnot a single species of plant or animal of which the range of variation\r\nhas been studied by the collocation and comparison of so large a number\r\nof specimens as have passed under the review of Messrs. Williamson,\r\nParker, Rupert Jones, and myself in our studies of the types of this\r\ngroup;\" and he states as the result of this extensive comparison of\r\nspecimens: \"The range of variation is so great among the Foraminifera\r\nas to include not merely those differential characters which have been\r\nusually accounted _specific_, but also those upon which the greater part\r\nof the _genera_, of this group have been founded, and even in some\r\ninstances those of its _orders_.\"[16]\r\n\r\nComing now to a higher group--the Sea-Anemones--Mr. P.H. Gosse and other\r\nwriters on these creatures often refer to variations in size, in the\r\nthickness and length of the tentacles, the form of the disc and of the\r\nmouth, and the character of surface of the column, while the colour\r\nvaries enormously in a great number of the species. Similar variations\r\noccur in all the various groups of marine invertebrata, and in the great\r\nsub-kingdom of the mollusca they are especially numerous. Thus, Dr. S.P.\r\nWoodward states that many present a most perplexing amount of variation,\r\nresulting (as he supposes) from supply of food, variety of depth and of\r\nsaltness of the water; but we know that many variations are quite\r\nindependent of such causes, and we will now consider a few cases among\r\nthe land-mollusca in which they have been more carefully studied.\r\n\r\nIn the small forest region of Oahu, one of the Sandwich Islands, there\r\nhave been found about 175 species of land-shells represented by 700 or\r\n800 varieties; and we are told by the Rev. J.T. Gulick, who studied them\r\ncarefully, that \"we frequently find a genus represented in several\r\nsuccessive valleys by allied species, sometimes feeding on the same,\r\nsometimes on different plants. In every such case the valleys that are\r\nnearest to each other furnish the most nearly allied forms; _and a full\r\nset of the varieties of each species presents a minute gradation of\r\nforms between the more divergent types found in the more widely\r\nseparated localities_.\"\r\n\r\nIn most land-shells there is a considerable amount of variation in\r\ncolour, markings, size, form, and texture or striation of the surface,\r\neven in specimens collected in the same locality. Thus, a French author\r\nhas enumerated no less than 198 varieties of the common wood-snail\r\n(Helix nemoralis), while of the equally common garden-snail (Helix\r\nhortensis) ninety varieties have been described. Fresh-water shells are\r\nalso subject to great variation, so that there is much uncertainty as\r\nto the number of species; and variations are especially frequent in the\r\nPlanorbidae, which exhibit many eccentric deviations from the usual form\r\nof the species--deviations which must often affect the form of the\r\nliving animal. In Mr. Ingersoll's Report on the Recent Mollusca of\r\nColorado many of these extraordinary variations are referred to, and it\r\nis stated that a shell (Helisonia trivolvis) abundant in some small\r\nponds and lakes, had scarcely two specimens alike, and many of them\r\nclosely resembled other and altogether distinct species.[17]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Variability of Insects_.\r\n\r\nAmong Insects there is a large amount of variation, though very few\r\nentomologists devote themselves to its investigation. Our first examples\r\nwill be taken from the late Mr. T. Vernon Wollaston's book, _On the\r\nVariation of Species_, and they must be considered as indications of\r\nvery widespread though little noticed phenomena. He speaks of the\r\ncurious little carabideous beetles of the genus Notiophilus as being\r\n\"extremely unstable both in their sculpture and hue;\" of the common\r\nCalathus mollis as having \"the hind wings at one time ample, at another\r\nrudimentary, and at a third nearly obsolete;\" and of the same\r\nirregularity as to the wings being characteristic of many Orthoptera and\r\nof the Homopterous Fulgoridae. Mr. Westwood in his _Modern\r\nClassification of Insects_ states that \"the species of Gerris,\r\nHydrometra, and Velia are mostly found perfectly apterous, though\r\noccasionally with full-sized wings.\"\r\n\r\nIt is, however, among the Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) that the\r\nmost numerous cases of variation have been observed, and every good\r\ncollection of these insects affords striking examples. I will first\r\nadduce the testimony of Mr. Bates, who speaks of the butterflies of the\r\nAmazon valley exhibiting innumerable local varieties or races, while\r\nsome species showed great individual variability. Of the beautiful\r\nMechanitis Polymnia he says, that at Ega on the Upper Amazons, \"it\r\nvaries not only in general colour and pattern, but also very\r\nconsiderably in the shape of the wings, especially in the male sex.\"\r\nAgain, at St. Paulo, Ithomia Orolina exhibits four distinct varieties,\r\nall occurring together, and these differ not only in colour but in form,\r\none variety being described as having the fore wings much elongated in\r\nthe male, while another is much larger and has \"the hind wings in the\r\nmale different in shape.\" Of Heliconius Numata Mr. Bates says: \"This\r\nspecies is so variable that it is difficult to find two examples exactly\r\nalike,\" while \"it varies in structure as well as in colours. The wings\r\nare sometimes broader, sometimes narrower; and their edges are simple in\r\nsome examples and festooned in others.\" Of another species of the same\r\ngenus, H. melpomene, ten distinct varieties are described all more or\r\nless connected by intermediate forms, and four of these varieties were\r\nobtained at one locality, Serpa on the north bank of the Amazon.\r\nCeratina Ninonia is another of these very unstable species exhibiting\r\nmany local varieties which are, however, incomplete and connected by\r\nintermediate forms; while the several species of the genus Lycorea all\r\nvary to such an extent as almost to link them together, so that Mr.\r\nBates thinks they might all fairly be considered as varieties of one\r\nspecies only.\r\n\r\nTurning to the Eastern Hemisphere we have in Papilio Severus a species\r\nwhich exhibits a large amount of simple variation, in the presence or\r\nabsence of a pale patch on the upper wings, in the brown submarginal\r\nmarks on the lower wings, in the form and extent of the yellow band, and\r\nin the size of the specimens. The most extreme forms, as well as the\r\nintermediate ones, are often found in one locality and in company with\r\neach other. A small butterfly (Terias hecabe) ranges over the whole of\r\nthe Indian and Malayan regions to Australia, and everywhere exhibits\r\ngreat variations, many of which have been described as distinct species;\r\nbut a gentleman in Australia bred two of these distinct forms (T. hecabe\r\nand T. Aesiope), with several intermediates, from one batch of\r\ncaterpillars found feeding together on the same plant.[18] It is\r\ntherefore very probable that a considerable number of supposed distinct\r\nspecies are only individual varieties.\r\n\r\nCases of variation similar to those now adduced among butterflies might\r\nbe increased indefinitely, but it is as well to note that such important\r\ncharacters as the neuration of the wings, on which generic and family\r\ndistinctions are often established, are also subject to variation. The\r\nRev. R.P. Murray, in 1872, laid before the Entomological Society\r\nexamples of such variation in six species of butterflies, and other\r\ncases have been since described. The larvae of butterflies and moths are\r\nalso very variable, and one observer recorded in the _Proceedings of the\r\nEntomological Society for_ 1870 no less than sixteen varieties of the\r\ncaterpillar of the bedstraw hawk-moth (Deilephela galii).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Variation among Lizards_.\r\n\r\nPassing on from the lower animals to the vertebrata, we find more\r\nabundant and more definite evidence as to the extent and amount of\r\nindividual variation. I will first give a case among the Reptilia from\r\nsome of Mr. Darwin's unpublished MSS., which have been kindly lent me by\r\nMr. Francis Darwin.\r\n\r\n\"M. Milne Edwards (_Annales des Sci. Nat._, I ser., tom. xvi. p. 50) has\r\ngiven a curious table of measurements of fourteen specimens of Lacerta\r\nmuralis; and, taking the length of the head as a standard, he finds the\r\nneck, trunk, tail, front and hind legs, colour, and femoral pores, all\r\nvarying wonderfully; and so it is more or less with other species. So\r\napparently trifling a character as the scales on the head affording\r\nalmost the only constant characters.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Variations of Lacerta muralis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Variation of Lizards.]\r\n\r\nAs the table of measurements above referred to would give no clear\r\nconception of the nature and amount of the variation without a laborious\r\nstudy and comparison of the figures, I have endeavoured to find a method\r\nof presenting the facts to the eye, so that they may be easily grasped\r\nand appreciated. In the diagram opposite, the comparative variations of\r\nthe different organs of this species are given by means of variously\r\nbent lines. The head is represented by a straight line because it\r\npresented (apparently) no variation. The body is next given, the\r\nspecimens being arranged in the order of their size from No. 1, the\r\nsmallest, to No. 14, the largest, the actual lengths being laid down\r\nfrom a base line at a suitable distance below, in this case two inches\r\nbelow the centre, the mean length of the body of the fourteen specimens\r\nbeing two inches. The respective lengths of the neck, legs, and toe of\r\neach specimen are then laid down in the same manner at convenient\r\ndistances apart for comparison; and we see that their variations bear no\r\ndefinite relation to those of the body, and not much to those of each\r\nother. With the exception of No. 5, in which all the parts agree in\r\nbeing large, there is a marked independence of each part, shown by the\r\nlines often curving in opposite directions; which proves that in those\r\nspecimens one part is large while the other is small. The actual amount\r\nof the variation is very great, ranging from one-sixth of the mean\r\nlength in the neck to considerably more than a fourth in the hind leg,\r\nand this among only fourteen examples which happen to be in a particular\r\nmuseum.\r\n\r\nTo prove that this is not an isolated case, Professor Milne Edwards also\r\ngives a table showing the amount of variation in the museum specimens of\r\nsix common species of lizards, also taking the head as the standard, so\r\nthat the comparative variation of each part to the head is given. In the\r\naccompanying diagram (Fig. 2) the variations are exhibited by means of\r\nlines of varying length. It will be understood that, however much the\r\nspecimens varied in _size_, if they had kept the same _proportions_, the\r\nvariation line would have been in every case reduced to a point, as in\r\nthe neck of L. velox which exhibits no variation. The different\r\nproportions of the variation lines for each species may show a distinct\r\nmode of variation, or may be merely due to the small and differing\r\nnumber of specimens; for it is certain that whatever amount of variation\r\noccurs among a few specimens will be greatly increased when a much\r\nlarger number of specimens are examined. That the amount of variation is\r\nlarge, may be seen by comparing it with the actual length of the head\r\n(given below the diagram) which was used as a standard in determining\r\nthe variation, but which itself seems not to have varied.[19]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Variation among Birds_.\r\n\r\nComing now to the class of Birds, we find much more copious evidence of\r\nvariation. This is due partly to the fact that Ornithology has perhaps a\r\nlarger body of devotees than any other branch of natural history (except\r\nentomology); to the moderate size of the majority of birds; and to the\r\ncircumstance that the form and dimensions of the wings, tail, beak, and\r\nfeet offer the best generic and specific characters and can all be\r\neasily measured and compared. The most systematic observations on the\r\nindividual variation of birds have been made by Mr. J.A. Allen, in his\r\nremarkable memoir: \"On the Mammals and Winter Birds of East Florida,\r\nwith an examination of certain assumed specific characters in Birds, and\r\na sketch of the Bird Faunae of Eastern North America,\" published in the\r\n_Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology_ at Harvard College,\r\nCambridge, Massachusetts, in 1871. In this work exact measurements are\r\ngiven of all the chief external parts of a large number of species of\r\ncommon American birds, from twenty to sixty or more specimens of each\r\nspecies being measured, so that we are able to determine with some\r\nprecision the nature and extent of the variation that usually occurs.\r\nMr. Allen says: \"The facts of the case show that a variation of from 15\r\nto 20 per cent in general size, and an equal degree of variation in the\r\nrelative size of different parts, may be ordinarily expected among\r\nspecimens of the same species and sex, taken at the same locality, while\r\nin some cases the variation is even greater than this.\" He then goes on\r\nto show that each part varies to a considerable extent independently of\r\nthe other parts; so that when the size varies, the proportions of all\r\nthe parts vary, often to a much greater amount. The wing and tail, for\r\nexample, besides varying in length, vary in the proportionate length of\r\neach feather, and this causes their outline to vary considerably in\r\nshape. The bill also varies in length, width, depth, and curvature. The\r\ntarsus varies in length, as does each toe separately and independently;\r\nand all this not to a minute degree requiring very careful measurement\r\nto detect it at all, but to an amount easily seen without any\r\nmeasurement, as it averages one-sixth of the whole length and often\r\nreaches one-fourth. In twelve species of common perching birds the wing\r\nvaried (in from twenty-five to thirty specimens) from 14 to 21 per cent\r\nof the mean length, and the tail from 13.8 to 23.4 per cent. The\r\nvariation of the form of the wing can be very easily tested by noting\r\nwhich feather is longest, which next in length, and so on, the\r\nrespective feathers being indicated by the numbers 1, 2, 3, etc.,\r\ncommencing with the outer one. As an example of the irregular variation\r\nconstantly met with, the following occurred among twenty-five specimens\r\nof Dendroeca coronata. Numbers bracketed imply that the corresponding\r\nfeathers were of equal length.[20]\r\n\r\n\r\n    RELATIVE LENGTHS OF PRIMARY WING FEATHERS OF\r\n    DENDROECA CORONATA.\r\n    ---------+-----------+----------+-----------+----------+----------\r\n    Longest. | Second in | Third in | Fourth in | Fifth in | Sixth in\r\n             |  Length.  |  Length. |  Length.  |  Length. |  Length.\r\n    ---------+-----------+----------+-----------+----------+----------\r\n    2        |     3     |     1    |     4     |     5    |     6\r\n    3        |     2     |     4    |     1     |     5    |     6\r\n             |  /  2     |          |           |          |\r\n    3        | {         |     1    |     5     |     6    |     7\r\n             |  \\  4     |          |           |          |\r\n    2    \\   |           |          |           |          |\r\n          }  |     4     |     1    |     5     |     6    |     7\r\n    3    /   |           |          |           |          |\r\n    2    \\   |           |          |           |          |\r\n    1     |  |           |          |           |          |\r\n           } |     5     |     6    |     7     |     8    |     9\r\n    3     |  |           |          |           |          |\r\n    4    /   |           |          |           |          |\r\n    ---------+-----------+----------+-----------+----------+----------\r\n\r\n\r\nHere we have five very distinct proportionate lengths of the wing\r\nfeathers, any one of which is often thought sufficient to characterise a\r\ndistinct species of bird; and though this is rather an extreme case, Mr.\r\nAllen assures us that \"the comparison, extended in the table to only a\r\nfew species, has been carried to scores of others with similar results.\"\r\n\r\nAlong with this variation in size and proportions there occurs a large\r\namount of variation in colour and markings. \"The difference in intensity\r\nof colour between the extremes of a series of fifty or one hundred\r\nspecimens of any species, collected at a single locality, and nearly at\r\nthe same season of the year, is often as great as occurs between truly\r\ndistinct species.\" But there is also a great amount of individual\r\nvariability in the markings of the same species. Birds having the\r\nplumage varied with streaks and spots differ exceedingly in different\r\nindividuals of the same species in respect to the size, shape, and\r\nnumber of these marks, and in the general aspect of the plumage\r\nresulting from such variations. \"In the common song sparrow (Melospiza\r\nmelodia), the fox-coloured sparrow (Passerella iliaca), the swamp\r\nsparrow (Melospiza palustris), the black and white creeper (Mniotilta\r\nvaria), the water-wagtail (Seiurus novaeboracencis), in Turdus\r\nfuscescens and its allies, the difference in the size of the streaks is\r\noften very considerable. In the song sparrow they vary to such an extent\r\nthat in some cases they are reduced to narrow lines; in others so\r\nenlarged as to cover the greater part of the breast and sides of the\r\nbody, sometimes uniting on the middle of the breast into a nearly\r\ncontinuous patch.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Allen then goes on to particularise several species in which such\r\nvariations occur, giving cases in which two specimens taken at the same\r\nplace on the same day exhibited the two extremes of coloration. Another\r\nset of variations is thus described: \"The white markings so common on\r\nthe wings and tails of birds, as the bars formed by the white tips of\r\nthe greater wing-coverts, the white patch occasionally present at the\r\nbase of the primary quills, or the white band crossing them, and the\r\nwhite patch near the end of the outer tail-feathers are also extremely\r\nliable to variation in respect to their extent and the number of\r\nfeathers to which, in the same species, these markings extend.\" It is to\r\nbe especially noted that all these varieties are distinct from those\r\nwhich depend on season, on age, or on sex, and that they are such as\r\nhave in many other species been considered to be of specific value.\r\n\r\nThese variations of colour could not be presented to the eye without a\r\nseries of carefully engraved plates, but in order to bring Mr. Allen's\r\n_measurements_, illustrating variations of size and proportion, more\r\nclearly before the reader, I have prepared a series of diagrams\r\nillustrating the more important facts and their bearings on the\r\nDarwinian theory.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is intended, mainly, to show the actual amount of the\r\nvariation, as it gives the true length of the wing and tail in the\r\nextreme cases among thirty specimens of each of three species. The\r\nshaded portion shows the minimum length, the unshaded portion the\r\nadditional length in the maximum. The point to be specially noted here\r\nis, that in each of these common species there is about the same amount\r\nof variation, and that it is so great as to be obvious at a glance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Variation of Wings and Tail.]\r\n\r\nThere is here no question of \"minute\" or \"infinitesimal\" variation,\r\nwhich many people suppose to be the only kind of variation that exists.\r\nIt cannot even be called small; yet from all the evidence we now possess\r\nit seems to be the amount which characterises most of the common species\r\nof birds.\r\n\r\nIt may be said, however, that these are the extreme variations, and only\r\noccur in one or two individuals, while the great majority exhibit little\r\nor no difference. Other diagrams will show that this is not the case;\r\nbut even if it were so, it would be no objection at all, because these\r\nare the extremes among thirty specimens only. We may safely assume that\r\nthese thirty specimens, taken by chance, are not, in the case of all\r\nthese species, exceptional lots, and therefore we might expect at least\r\ntwo similarly varying specimens in each additional thirty. But the\r\nnumber of individuals, even in a very rare species, is probably thirty\r\nthousand or more, and in a common species thirty, or even three hundred,\r\nmillions. Even one individual in each thirty, varying to the amount\r\nshown in the diagram, would give at least a million in the total\r\npopulation of any common bird, and among this million many would vary\r\nmuch more than the extreme among thirty only. We should thus have a vast\r\nbody of individuals varying to a large extent in the length of the wings\r\nand tail, and offering ample material for the modification of these\r\norgans by natural selection. We will now proceed to show that other\r\nparts of the body vary, simultaneously, but independently, to an equal\r\namount.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Dolichonyx oryzivorus. 20 Males.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Agelaeus phoeniceus. 40 Males.]\r\n\r\nThe first bird taken is the common Bob-o-link or Rice-bird (Dolichonyx\r\noryzivorus), and the Diagram, Fig. 4, exhibits the variations of seven\r\nimportant characters in twenty male adult specimens.[21] These\r\ncharacters are--the lengths of the body, wing, tail, tarsus, middle toe,\r\nouter toe, and hind toe, being as many as can be conveniently exhibited\r\nin one diagram. The length of the body is not given by Mr. Allen, but as\r\nit forms a convenient standard of comparison, it has been obtained by\r\ndeducting the length of the tail from the total length of the birds as\r\ngiven by him. The diagram has been constructed as follows:--The twenty\r\nspecimens are first arranged in a series according to the body-lengths\r\n(which may be considered to give the size of the bird), from the\r\nshortest to the longest, and the same number of vertical lines are\r\ndrawn, numbered from one to twenty. In this case (and wherever\r\npracticable) the body-length is measured from the lower line of the\r\ndiagram, so that the actual length of the bird is exhibited as well as\r\nthe actual variations of length. These can be well estimated by means of\r\nthe horizontal line drawn at the mean between the two extremes, and it\r\nwill be seen that one-fifth of the total number of specimens taken on\r\neither side exhibits a very large amount of variation, which would of\r\ncourse be very much greater if a hundred or more specimens were\r\ncompared. The lengths of the wing, tail, and other parts are then laid\r\ndown, and the diagram thus exhibits at a glance the comparative\r\nvariation of these parts in every specimen as well as the actual amount\r\nof variation in the twenty specimens; and we are thus enabled to arrive\r\nat some important conclusions.\r\n\r\nWe note, first, that the variations of none of the parts follow the\r\nvariations of the body, but are sometimes almost in an opposite\r\ndirection. Thus the longest wing corresponds to a rather small body, the\r\nlongest tail to a medium body, while the longest leg and toes belong to\r\nonly a moderately large body. Again, even related parts do not\r\nconstantly vary together but present many instances of independent\r\nvariation, as shown by the want of parallelism in their respective\r\nvariation-lines. In No. 5 (see Fig. 4) the wing is very long, the tail\r\nmoderately so; while in No. 6 the wing is much shorter while the tail is\r\nconsiderably longer. The tarsus presents comparatively little variation;\r\nand although the three toes may be said to vary in general together,\r\nthere are many divergencies; thus, in passing from No. 9 to No. 10, the\r\nouter toe becomes longer, while the hind toe becomes considerably\r\nshorter; while in Nos. 3 and 4 the middle toe varies in an opposite way\r\nto the outer and the hind toes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Cardinalis virginianus. 31 Males.]\r\n\r\nIn the next diagram (Fig. 5) we have the variations in forty males of\r\nthe Red-winged Blackbird (Agelaeus phoeniceus), and here we see the same\r\ngeneral features. One-fifth of the whole number of specimens offer a\r\nlarge amount of variation either below or above the mean; while the\r\nwings, tail, and head vary quite independently of the body. The wing and\r\ntail too, though showing some amount of correlated variation, yet in\r\nno less than nine cases vary in opposite directions as compared with the\r\npreceding species.\r\n\r\nThe next diagram (Fig. 6), showing the variations of thirty-one males of\r\nthe Cardinal bird (Cardinalis virginianus), exhibits these features much\r\nmore strongly. The amount of variation in proportion to the size of the\r\nbird is very much greater; while the variations of the wing and tail not\r\nonly have no correspondence with that of the body but very little with\r\neach other. In no less than twelve or thirteen instances they vary in\r\nopposite directions, while even where they correspond in direction the\r\namount of the variation is often very disproportionate.\r\n\r\nAs the proportions of the tarsi and toes of birds have great influence\r\non their mode of life and habits and are often used as specific or even\r\ngeneric characters, I have prepared a diagram (Fig. 7) to show the\r\nvariation in these parts only, among twenty specimens of each of four\r\nspecies of birds, four or five of the most variable alone being given.\r\nThe extreme divergence of each of the lines in a vertical direction\r\nshows the actual amount of variation; and if we consider the small\r\nlength of the toes of these small birds, averaging about three-quarters\r\nof an inch, we shall see that the variation is really very large; while\r\nthe diverging curves and angles show that each part varies, to a great\r\nextent, independently. It is evident that if we compared some thousands\r\nof individuals instead of only twenty, we should have an amount of\r\nindependent variation occurring each year which would enable almost any\r\nmodification of these important organs to be rapidly effected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Variation of Tarsus and Toes.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Variation of Birds in Leyden Museum.]\r\n\r\nIn order to meet the objection that the large amount of variability here\r\nshown depends chiefly on the observations of one person and on the birds\r\nof a single country, I have examined Professor Schlegel's Catalogue of\r\nthe Birds in the Leyden Museum, in which he usually gives the range of\r\nvariation of the specimens in the museum (which are commonly less than a\r\ndozen and rarely over twenty) as regards some of their more important\r\ndimensions. These fully support the statement of Mr. Allen, since they\r\nshow an equal amount of variability when the numbers compared are\r\nsufficient, which, however, is not often the case. The accompanying\r\ndiagram exhibits the actual differences of size in five organs which\r\noccur in five species taken almost at random from this catalogue. Here,\r\nagain, we perceive that the variation is decidedly large, even among a\r\nvery small number of specimens; while the facts all show that there is\r\nno ground whatever for the common assumption that natural species\r\nconsist of individuals which are nearly all alike, or that the\r\nvariations which occur are \"infinitesimal\" or even \"small.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_The proportionate Number of Individuals which present a considerable\r\namount of Variation._\r\n\r\nThe notion that variation is a comparatively exceptional phenomenon, and\r\nthat in any case considerable variations occur very rarely in proportion\r\nto the number of individuals which do not vary, is so deeply rooted that\r\nit is necessary to show by every possible method of illustration how\r\ncompletely opposed it is to the facts of nature. I have therefore\r\nprepared some diagrams in which each of the individual birds measured is\r\nrepresented by a spot, placed at a proportionate distance, right and\r\nleft, from the median line accordingly as it varies in excess or defect\r\nof the mean length as regards the particular part compared. As the\r\nobject in this set of diagrams is to show the number of individuals\r\nwhich vary considerably in proportion to those which vary little or not\r\nat all, the scale has been enlarged in order to allow room for placing\r\nthe spots without overlapping each other.\r\n\r\nIn the diagram opposite twenty males of Icterus Baltimore are\r\nregistered, so as to exhibit to the eye the proportionate number of\r\nspecimens which vary, to a greater or less amount, in the length of the\r\ntail, wing, tarsus, middle toe, hind toe, and bill. It will be noticed\r\nthat there is usually no very great accumulation of dots about the\r\nmedian line which shows the average dimensions, but that a considerable\r\nnumber are spread at varying distances on each side of it.\r\n\r\nIn the next diagram (Fig. 10), showing the variation among forty males\r\nof Agelaeeus phoeniceus, this approach to an equable spreading of the\r\nvariations is still more apparent; while in Fig. 12, where fifty-eight\r\nspecimens of Cardinalis virginianus are registered, we see a remarkable\r\nspreading out of the spots, showing in some of the characters a tendency\r\nto segregation into two or more groups of individuals, each varying\r\nconsiderably from the mean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\nIn order fully to appreciate the teaching of these diagrams, we must\r\nremember, that, whatever kind and amount of variations are exhibited by\r\nthe few specimens here compared, would be greatly extended and brought\r\ninto symmetrical form if large numbers--thousands or millions--were\r\nsubjected to the same process of measurement and registration. We know,\r\nfrom the general law which governs variations from a mean value, that\r\nwith increasing numbers the range of variation of each part would\r\nincrease also, at first rather rapidly and then more slowly; while gaps\r\nand irregularities would be gradually filled up, and at length the\r\ndistribution of the dots would indicate a tolerably regular curve of\r\ndouble curvature like those shown in Fig. 11. The great divergence of\r\nthe dots, when even a few specimens are compared, shows that the curve,\r\nwith high numbers, would be a flat one like the lower curve in the\r\nillustration here given. This being the case it would follow that a very\r\nlarge proportion of the total number of individuals constituting a\r\nspecies would diverge considerably from its average condition as regards\r\neach part or organ; and as we know from the previous diagrams of\r\nvariation (Figs. 1 to 7) that each part varies to a considerable extent,\r\n_independently_, the materials constantly ready for natural selection to\r\nact upon are abundant in quantity and very varied in kind. Almost any\r\ncombination of variations of distinct parts will be available, where\r\nrequired; and this, as we shall see further on, obviates one of the most\r\nweighty objections which have been urged against the efficiency of\r\nnatural selection in producing new species, genera, and higher groups.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Variation in the Mammalia._\r\n\r\nOwing to the generally large size of this class of animals, and the\r\ncomparatively small number of naturalists who study them, large series\r\nof specimens are only occasionally examined and compared, and thus the\r\nmaterials for determining the question of their variability in a state\r\nof nature are comparatively scanty. The fact that our domestic animals\r\nbelonging to this group, especially dogs, present extreme varieties not\r\nsurpassed even by pigeons and poultry among birds, renders it almost\r\ncertain that an equal amount of variability exists in the wild state;\r\nand this is confirmed by the example of a species of squirrel (Sciurus\r\ncarolinensis), of which sixteen specimens, all males and all taken in\r\nFlorida, were measured and tabulated by Mr. Allen. The diagram here\r\ngiven shows, that, both the general amount of the variation and the\r\nindependent variability of the several members of the body, accord\r\ncompletely with the variations so common in the class of birds; while\r\ntheir amount and their independence of each other are even greater than\r\nusual.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Variation in the Internal Organs of Animals._\r\n\r\nIn case it should be objected that the cases of variation hitherto\r\nadduced are in the external parts only, and that there is no proof that\r\nthe internal organs vary in the same manner, it will be advisable to\r\nshow that such varieties also occur. It is, however, impossible to\r\nadduce the same amount of evidence in this class of variation, because\r\nthe great labour of dissecting large numbers of specimens of the same\r\nspecies is rarely undertaken, and we have to trust to the chance\r\nobservations of anatomists recorded in their regular course of study.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be noted that a very large proportion of the\r\nvariations already recorded in the external parts of animals necessarily\r\nimply corresponding internal variations. When feet and legs vary in\r\nsize, it is because the bones vary; when the head, body, limbs, and tail\r\nchange their proportions, the bony skeleton must also change; and even\r\nwhen the wing or tail feathers of birds become longer or more numerous,\r\nthere is sure to be a corresponding change in the bones which support\r\nand the muscles which move them. I will, however, give a few cases of\r\nvariations which have been directly observed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Sciurus carolinensis. 32 specimens. Florida.]\r\n\r\nMr. Frank E. Beddard has kindly communicated to me some remarkable\r\nvariations he has observed in the internal organs of a species of\r\nearthworm (Perionyx excavatus). The normal characters of this species\r\nare--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Setae forming a complete row round each segment.\r\n\r\n    Two pairs of spermathecae--spherical pouches without\r\n    diverticulae--in segments 8 and 9.\r\n\r\n    Two pairs of testes in segments 11 and 12.\r\n\r\n    Ovaries, a single pair in segment 13.\r\n\r\n    Oviducts open by a common pore in the middle of segment 14.\r\n\r\n    Vasa deferentia open separately in segment 18, each furnished at\r\n    its termination with a large prostate gland.\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween two and three hundred specimens were examined, and among them\r\nthirteen specimens exhibited the following marked variations:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    (1) The number of the spermathecae varied from two to three or\r\n    four pairs, their position also varying.\r\n\r\n    (2) There were occasionally two pairs of ovaries, each with its\r\n    own oviduct; the external apertures of these varied in position,\r\n    being upon segments 13 and 14, 14 and 15, or 15 and 16.\r\n    Occasionally when there was only the normal single oviduct pore\r\n    present it varied in position, once occurring on the 10th, and\r\n    once on the 11th segment.\r\n\r\n    (3) The male generative pores varied in position from segments\r\n    14 to 20. In one instance there were two pairs instead of the\r\n    normal single pair, and in this case each of the four apertures\r\n    had its own prostate gland.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Beddard remarks that all, or nearly all, the above variations are\r\nfound _normally_ in other genera and species.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the enormous number of earthworms and the comparatively\r\nvery small number of individuals examined, we may be sure, not only that\r\nsuch variations as these occur with considerable frequency, but also\r\nthat still more extraordinary deviations from the normal structure may\r\noften exist.\r\n\r\nThe next example is taken from Mr. Darwin's unpublished MSS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"In some species of Shrews (Sorex) and in some field-mice\r\n    (Arvicola), the Rev. L. Jenyns (_Ann. Nat. Hist._, vol. vii. pp.\r\n    267, 272) found the proportional length of the intestinal canal\r\n    to vary considerably. He found the same variability in the\r\n    number of the caudal vertebrae. In three specimens of an\r\n    Arvicola he found the gall-bladder having a very different\r\n    degree of development, and there is reason to believe it is\r\n    sometimes absent. Professor Owen has shown that this is the case\r\n    with the gall-bladder of the giraffe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Crisp (_Proc. Zool. Soc._, 1862, p. 137) found the gall-bladder\r\npresent in some specimens of Cervus superciliaris while absent in\r\nothers; and he found it to be absent in three giraffes which he\r\ndissected. A double gall-bladder was found in a sheep, and in a small\r\nmammal preserved in the Hunterian Museum there are three distinct\r\ngall-bladders.\r\n\r\nThe length of the alimentary canal varies greatly. In three adult\r\ngiraffes described by Professor Owen it was from 124 to 136 feet long;\r\none dissected in France had this canal 211 feet long; while Dr. Crisp\r\nmeasured one of the extraordinary length of 254 feet, and similar\r\nvariations are recorded in other animals.[22]\r\n\r\nThe number of ribs varies in many animals. Mr. St. George Mivart says:\r\n\"In the highest forms of the Primates, the number of true ribs is seven,\r\nbut in Hylobates there are sometimes eight pairs. In Semnopithecus and\r\nColobus there are generally seven, but sometimes eight pairs of true\r\nribs. In the Cebidae there are generally seven or eight pairs, but in\r\nAteles sometimes nine\" (_Proc. Zool. Soc._, 1865, p. 568). In the same\r\npaper it is stated that the number of dorsal vertebrae in man is\r\nnormally twelve, very rarely thirteen. In the Chimpanzee there are\r\nnormally thirteen dorsal vertebrae, but occasionally there are fourteen\r\nor only twelve.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Variations in the Skull._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Variation of Skull of Wolf. 10 specimens.]\r\n\r\nAmong the nine adult male Orang-utans, collected by myself in Borneo,\r\nthe skulls differed remarkably in size and proportions. The orbits\r\nvaried in width and height, the cranial ridge was either single or\r\ndouble, either much or little developed, and the zygomatic aperture\r\nvaried considerably in size. I noted particularly that these\r\nvariations bore no necessary relation to each other, so that a large\r\ntemporal muscle and zygomatic aperture might exist either with a large\r\nor a small cranium; and thus was explained the curious difference\r\nbetween the single-crested and the double-crested skulls, which had been\r\nsupposed to characterise distinct species. As an instance of the amount\r\nof variation in the skulls of fully adult male orangs, I found the width\r\nbetween the orbits externally to be only 4 inches in one specimen and\r\nfully 5 inches in another.\r\n\r\nExact measurements of large series of comparable skulls of the mammalia\r\nare not easily found, but from those available I have prepared three\r\ndiagrams (Figs. 14, 15, and 16), in order to exhibit the facts of\r\nvariation in this very important organ. The first shows the variation in\r\nten specimens of the common wolf (Canis lupus) from one district in\r\nNorth America, and we see that it is not only large in amount, but that\r\neach part exhibits a considerable independent variability.[23]\r\n\r\nIn Diagram 15 we have the variations of eight skulls of the Indian\r\nHoney-bear (Ursus labiatus), as tabulated by the late Dr. J.E. Gray of\r\nthe British Museum. For such a small number of specimens the amount of\r\nvariation is very large--from one-eighth to one-fifth of the mean\r\nsize,--while there are an extraordinary number of instances of\r\nindependent variability. In Diagram 16 we have the length and width of\r\ntwelve skulls of adult males of the Indian wild boar (Sus cristatus),\r\nalso given by Dr. Gray, exhibiting in both sets of measurements a\r\nvariation of more than one-sixth, combined with a very considerable\r\namount of independent variability.[24]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Variation of 8 skulls (Ursus labiatus).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.]\r\n\r\nThe few facts now given, as to variations of the internal parts of\r\nanimals, might be multiplied indefinitely by a search through the\r\nvoluminous writings of comparative anatomists. But the evidence already\r\nadduced, taken in conjunction with the much fuller evidence of variation\r\nin all external organs, leads us to the conclusion that wherever\r\nvariations are looked for among a considerable number of individuals of\r\nthe more common species they are sure to be found; that they are\r\neverywhere of considerable amount, often reaching 20 per cent of the\r\nsize of the part implicated; and that they are to a great extent\r\nindependent of each other, and thus afford almost any combination of\r\nvariations that may be needed.\r\n\r\nIt must be particularly noticed that the whole series of\r\nvariation-diagrams here given (except the three which illustrate the\r\nnumber of varying individuals) in every case represent the actual amount\r\nof the variation, not on any reduced or enlarged scale, but as it were\r\nlife-size. Whatever number of inches or decimals of an inch the species\r\nvaries in any of its parts is marked on the diagrams, so that with the\r\nhelp of an ordinary divided rule or a pair of compasses the variation of\r\nthe different parts can be ascertained and compared just as if the\r\nspecimens themselves were before the reader, but with much greater ease.\r\n\r\nIn my lectures on the Darwinian theory in America and in this country I\r\nused diagrams constructed on a different plan, equally illustrating the\r\nlarge amount of independent variability, but less simple and less\r\nintelligible. The present method is a modification of that used by Mr.\r\nFrancis Galton in his researches on the theory of variability, the upper\r\nline (showing the variability of the body) in Diagrams 4, 5, 6, and 13,\r\nbeing laid down on the method he has used in his experiments with\r\nsweet-peas and in pedigree moth-breeding.[25] I believe, after much\r\nconsideration, and many tedious experiments in diagram-making, that no\r\nbetter method can be adopted for bringing before the eye, both the\r\namount and the peculiar features of individual variability.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Variations of the Habits of Animals._\r\n\r\nClosely connected with those variations of internal and external\r\nstructure which have been already described, are the changes of habits\r\nwhich often occur in certain individuals or in whole species, since\r\nthese must necessarily depend upon some corresponding change in the\r\nbrain or in other parts of the organism; and as these changes are of\r\ngreat importance in relation to the theory of instinct, a few examples\r\nof them will be now adduced.\r\n\r\nThe Kea (Nestor notabilis) is a curious parrot inhabiting the mountain\r\nranges of the Middle Island of New Zealand. It belongs to the family of\r\nBrush-tongued parrots, and naturally feeds on the honey of flowers and\r\nthe insects which frequent them, together with such fruits or berries as\r\nare found in the region. Till quite recently this comprised its whole\r\ndiet, but since the country it inhabits has become occupied by Europeans\r\nit has developed a taste for a carnivorous diet, with alarming results.\r\nIt began by picking the sheepskins hung out to dry or the meat in\r\nprocess of being cured. About 1868 it was first observed to attack\r\nliving sheep, which had frequently been found with raw and bleeding\r\nwounds on their backs. Since then it is stated that the bird actually\r\nburrows into the living sheep, eating its way down to the kidneys, which\r\nform its special delicacy. As a natural consequence, the bird is being\r\ndestroyed as rapidly as possible, and one of the rare and curious\r\nmembers of the New Zealand fauna will no doubt shortly cease to exist.\r\nThe case affords a remarkable instance of how the climbing feet and\r\npowerful hooked beak developed for one set of purposes can be applied to\r\nanother altogether different purpose, and it also shows how little real\r\nstability there may be in what appear to us the most fixed habits of\r\nlife. A somewhat similar change of diet has been recorded by the Duke of\r\nArgyll, in which a goose, reared by a golden eagle, was taught by its\r\nfoster-parent to eat flesh, which it continued to do regularly and\r\napparently with great relish.[26]\r\n\r\nChange of habits appears to be often a result of imitation, of which Mr.\r\nTegetmeier gives some good examples. He states that if pigeons are\r\nreared exclusively with small grain, as wheat or barley, they will\r\nstarve before eating beans. But when they are thus starving, if a\r\nbean-eating pigeon is put among them, they follow its example, and\r\nthereafter adopt the habit. So fowls sometimes refuse to eat maize, but\r\non seeing others eat it, they do the same and become excessively fond of\r\nit. Many persons have found that their yellow crocuses were eaten by\r\nsparrows, while the blue, purple, and white coloured varieties were left\r\nuntouched; but Mr. Tegetmeier, who grows only these latter colours,\r\nfound that after two years the sparrows began to attack them, and\r\nthereafter destroyed them quite as readily as the yellow ones; and he\r\nbelieves it was merely because some bolder sparrow than the rest set the\r\nexample. On this subject Mr. Charles C. Abbott well remarks: \"In\r\nstudying the habits of our American birds--and I suppose it is true of\r\nbirds everywhere--it must at all times be remembered that there is less\r\nstability in the habits of birds than is usually supposed; and no\r\naccount of the habits of any one species will exactly detail the various\r\nfeatures of its habits as they really are, in every portion of the\r\nterritory it inhabits.\"[27]\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Dixon has recorded a remarkable change in the mode of\r\nnest-building of some common chaffinches which were taken to New Zealand\r\nand turned out there. He says: \"The cup of the nest is small, loosely\r\nput together, apparently lined with feathers, and the walls of the\r\nstructure are prolonged for about 18 inches, and hang loosely down the\r\nside of the supporting branch. The whole structure bears some\r\nresemblance to the nests of the hangnests (Icteridae), with the\r\nexception that the cavity is at the top. Clearly these New Zealand\r\nchaffinches were at a loss for a design when fabricating their nest.\r\nThey had no standard to work by, no nests of their own kind to copy, no\r\nolder birds to give them any instruction, and the result is the abnormal\r\nstructure I have just described.\"[28]\r\n\r\nThese few examples are sufficient to show that both the habits and\r\ninstincts of animals are subject to variation; and had we a sufficient\r\nnumber of detailed observations we should probably find that these\r\nvariations were as numerous, as diverse in character, as large in\r\namount, and as independent of each other as those which we have seen to\r\ncharacterise their bodily structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Variability of Plants._\r\n\r\nThe variability of plants is notorious, being proved not only by the\r\nendless variations which occur whenever a species is largely grown by\r\nhorticulturists, but also by the great difficulty that is felt by\r\nbotanists in determining the limits of species in many large genera. As\r\nexamples we may take the roses, the brambles, and the willows as well\r\nillustrating this fact. In Mr. Baker's _Revision of the British Roses_\r\n(published by the Linnean Society in 1863), he includes under the single\r\nspecies, Rosa canina--the common dog-rose--no less than twenty-eight\r\nnamed _varieties_ distinguished by more or less constant characters and\r\noften confined to special localities, and to these are referred about\r\nseventy of the _species_ of British and continental botanists. Of the\r\ngenus Rubus or bramble, _five_ British species are given in Bentham's\r\n_Handbook of the British Flora_, while in the fifth edition of\r\nBabington's _Manual of British Botany_, published about the same time,\r\nno less than _forty-five_ species are described. Of willows (Salix) the\r\nsame two works enumerate _fifteen_ and _thirty-one_ species\r\nrespectively. The hawkweeds (Hieracium) are equally puzzling, for while\r\nMr. Bentham admits only seven British species, Professor Babington\r\ndescribes no less than thirty-two, besides several named varieties.\r\n\r\nA French botanist, Mons. A. Jordan, has collected numerous forms of a\r\ncommon little plant, the spring whitlow-grass (Draba verna); he has\r\ncultivated these for several successive years, and declares that they\r\npreserve their peculiarities unchanged; he also says that they each come\r\ntrue from seed, and thus possess all the characteristics of true\r\nspecies. He has described no less than fifty-two such species or\r\npermanent varieties, all found in the south of France; and he urges\r\nbotanists to follow his example in collecting, describing, and\r\ncultivating all such varieties as may occur in their respective\r\ndistricts. Now, as the plant is very common almost all over Europe and\r\nranges from North America to the Himalayas, the number of similar forms\r\nover this wide area would probably have to be reckoned by hundreds if\r\nnot by thousands.\r\n\r\nThe class of facts now adduced must certainly be held to prove that in\r\nmany large genera and in some single species there is a very large\r\namount of variation, which renders it quite impossible for experts to\r\nagree upon the limits of species. We will now adduce a few striking\r\ncases of individual variation.\r\n\r\nThe distinguished botanist, Alp. de Candolle, made a special study of\r\nthe oaks of the whole world, and has stated some remarkable facts as to\r\ntheir variability. He declares that on the same branch of oak he has\r\nnoted the following variations: (1) In the length of the petiole, as one\r\nto three; (2) in the form of the leaf, being either elliptical or\r\nobovoid; (3) in the margin being entire, or notched, or even pinnatifid;\r\n(4) in the extremity being acute or blunt; (5) in the base being sharp,\r\nblunt, or cordate; (6) in the surface being pubescent or smooth; (7) the\r\nperianth varies in depth and lobing; (8) the stamens vary in number,\r\nindependently; (9) the anthers are mucronate or blunt; (10) the fruit\r\nstalks vary greatly in length, often as one to three; (11) the number of\r\nfruits varies; (12) the form of the base of the cup varies; (13) the\r\nscales of the cup vary in form; (14) the proportions of the acorns vary;\r\n(15) the times of the acorns ripening and falling vary.\r\n\r\nBesides this, many species exhibit well-marked varieties which have been\r\ndescribed and named, and these are most numerous in the best-known\r\nspecies. Our British oak (Quercus robur) has twenty-eight varieties;\r\nQuercus Lusitanica has eleven; Quercus calliprinos has ten; and Quercus\r\ncoccifera eight.\r\n\r\nA most remarkable case of variation in the parts of a common flower has\r\nbeen given by Dr. Hermann Müller. He examined two hundred flowers of\r\nMyosurus minimus, among which he found _thirty-five_ different\r\nproportions of the sepals, petals, and anthers, the first varying from\r\nfour to seven, the second from two to five, and the third from two to\r\nten. Five sepals occurred in one hundred and eighty-nine out of the two\r\nhundred, but of these one hundred and five had three petals, forty-six\r\nhad four petals, and twenty-six had five petals; but in each of these\r\nsets the anthers varied in number from three to eight, or from two to\r\nnine. We have here an example of the same amount of \"independent\r\nvariability\" that, as we have seen, occurs in the various dimensions of\r\nbirds and mammals; and it may be taken as an illustration of the kind\r\nand degree of variability that may be expected to occur among small and\r\nlittle specialised flowers.[29]\r\n\r\nIn the common wind-flower (Anemone nemorosa) an almost equal amount of\r\nvariation occurs; and I have myself gathered in one locality flowers\r\nvarying from 7/8 inch to 1-3/4 inch in diameter; the bracts varying from\r\n1-1/2 inch to 4 inches across; and the petaloid sepals either broad or\r\nnarrow, and varying in number from five to ten. Though generally pure\r\nwhite on their upper surface, some specimens are a full pink, while\r\nothers have a decided bluish tinge.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin states that he carefully examined a large number of plants of\r\nGeranium phaeum and G. pyrenaicum (not perhaps truly British but\r\nfrequently found wild), which had escaped from cultivation, and had\r\nspread by seed in an open plantation; and he declares that \"the\r\nseedlings varied in almost every single character, both in their flowers\r\nand foliage, to a degree which I have never seen exceeded; yet they\r\ncould not have been exposed to any great change of their\r\nconditions.\"[30]\r\n\r\nThe following examples of variation in important parts of plants were\r\ncollected by Mr. Darwin and have been copied from his unpublished\r\nMSS.:--\r\n\r\n\"De Candolle (_Mem. Soc. Phys. de Genève_, tom. ii. part ii. p. 217)\r\nstates that Papaver bracteatum and P. orientale present indifferently\r\ntwo sepals and four petals, or three sepals and six petals, which is\r\nsufficiently rare with other species of the genus.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the Primulacae and in the great class to which this family belongs\r\nthe unilocular ovarium is free, but M. Dubury (_Mem. Soc. Phys. de\r\nGenève_, tom. ii. p. 406) has often found individuals in Cyclamen\r\nhederaefolium, in which the base of the ovary was connected for a third\r\npart of its length with the inferior part of the calyx.\"\r\n\r\n\"M. Aug. St. Hilaire (Sur la Gynobase, _Mem. des Mus. d'Hist. Nat._,\r\ntom. x. p. 134), speaking of some bushes of the Gomphia oleaefolia,\r\nwhich he at first thought formed a quite distinct species, says: 'Voilà\r\ndonc dans un même individu des loges et un style qui se rattachent\r\ntantôt a un axe vertical, et tantôt a un gynobase; donc celui-ci n'est\r\nqu'un axe veritable; mais cet axe est deprimé au lieu d'être vertical.\"\r\nHe adds (p. 151), 'Does not all this indicate that nature has tried, in\r\na manner, in the family of Rutaceae to produce from a single\r\nmultilocular ovary, one-styled and symmetrical, several unilocular\r\novaries, each with its own style.' And he subsequently shows that, in\r\nXanthoxylum monogynum, 'it often happens that on the same plant, on the\r\nsame panicle, we find flowers with one or with two ovaries;' and that\r\nthis is an important character is shown by the Rutaceae (to which\r\nXanthoxylum belongs), being placed in a group of natural orders\r\ncharacterised by having a solitary ovary.\"\r\n\r\n\"De Candolle has divided the Cruciferae into five sub-orders in\r\naccordance with the position of the radicle and cotyledons, yet Mons. T.\r\nGay (_Ann. des Scien. Nat._, ser. i. tom. vii. p. 389) found in sixteen\r\nseeds of Petrocallis Pyrenaica the form of the embryo so uncertain that\r\nhe could not tell whether it ought to be placed in the sub-orders\r\n'Pleurorhizée' or 'Notor-hizée'; so again (p. 400) in Cochlearia\r\nsaxatilis M. Gay examined twenty-nine embryos, and of these sixteen were\r\nvigorously 'pleurorhizées,' nine had characters intermediate between\r\npleuro-and notor-hizées, and four were pure notor-hizées.\"\r\n\r\n\"M. Raspail asserts (_Ann. des Scien. Nat._, ser. i. tom. v. p. 440)\r\nthat a grass (Nostus Borbonicus) is so eminently variable in its floral\r\norganisation, that the varieties might serve to make a family with\r\nsufficiently numerous genera and tribes--a remark which shows that\r\nimportant organs must be here variable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Species which vary little._\r\n\r\nThe preceding statements, as to the great amount of variation occurring\r\nin animals and plants, do not prove that all species vary to the same\r\nextent, or even vary at all, but, merely, that a considerable number of\r\nspecies in every class, order, and family do so vary. It will have been\r\nobserved that the examples of great variability have all been taken from\r\ncommon species, or species which have a wide range and are abundant in\r\nindividuals. Now Mr. Darwin concludes, from an elaborate examination of\r\nthe floras and faunas of several distinct regions, that common, wide\r\nranging species, as a rule, vary most, while those that are confined to\r\nspecial districts and are therefore comparatively limited in number of\r\nindividuals vary least. By a similar comparison it is shown that species\r\nof large genera vary more than species of small genera. These facts\r\nexplain, to some extent, why the opinion has been so prevalent that\r\nvariation is very limited in amount and exceptional in character. For\r\nnaturalists of the old school, and all mere collectors, were interested\r\nin species in proportion to their rarity, and would often have in their\r\ncollections a larger number of specimens of a rare species than of a\r\nspecies that was very common. Now as these rare species do really vary\r\nmuch less than the common species, and in many cases hardly vary at all,\r\nit was very natural that a belief in the fixity of species should\r\nprevail. It is not, however, as we shall see presently, the rare, but\r\nthe common and widespread species which become the parents of new forms,\r\nand thus the non-variability of any number of rare or local species\r\noffers no difficulty whatever in the way of the theory of evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Concluding Remarks._\r\n\r\nWe have now shown in some detail, at the risk of being tedious, that\r\nindividual variability is a general character of all common and\r\nwidespread species of animals or plants; and, further, that this\r\nvariability extends, so far as we know, to every part and organ, whether\r\nexternal or internal, as well as to every mental faculty. Yet more\r\nimportant is the fact that each part or organ varies to a considerable\r\nextent independently of other parts. Again, we have shown, by abundant\r\nevidence, that the variation that occurs is very large in\r\namount--usually reaching 10 or 20, and sometimes even 25 per cent of the\r\naverage size of the varying part; while not one or two only, but from 5\r\nto 10 per cent of the specimens examined exhibit nearly as large an\r\namount of variation. These facts have been brought clearly before the\r\nreader by means of numerous diagrams, drawn to scale and exhibiting the\r\nactual variations in inches, so that there can be no possibility of\r\ndenying either their generality or their amount. The importance of this\r\nfull exposition of the subject will be seen in future chapters, when we\r\nshall frequently have to refer to the facts here set forth, especially\r\nwhen we deal with the various theories of recent writers and the\r\ncriticisms that have been made of the Darwinian theory.\r\n\r\nA full exposition of the facts of variation among wild animals and\r\nplants is the more necessary, because comparatively few of them were\r\npublished in Mr. Darwin's works, while the more important have only been\r\nmade known since the last edition of _The Origin of Species_ was\r\nprepared; and it is clear that Mr. Darwin himself did not fully\r\nrecognise the enormous amount of variability that actually exists. This\r\nis indicated by his frequent reference to the extreme slowness of the\r\nchanges for which variation furnishes the materials, and also by his use\r\nof such expressions as the following: \"A variety when once formed must\r\nagain, _perhaps after a long interval of time_, vary or present\r\nindividual differences of the same favourable nature as before\"\r\n(_Origin_, p. 66). And again, after speaking of changed conditions\r\n\"affording a better chance of the occurrence of favourable variations,\"\r\nhe adds: \"_Unless such occur natural selection can do nothing_\"\r\n(_Origin_, p. 64). These expressions are hardly consistent with the fact\r\nof the constant and large amount of variation, of every part, in all\r\ndirections, which evidently occurs in each generation of all the more\r\nabundant species, and which must afford an ample supply of favourable\r\nvariations whenever required; and they have been seized upon and\r\nexaggerated by some writers as proofs of the extreme difficulties in the\r\nway of the theory. It is to show that such difficulties do not exist,\r\nand in the full conviction that an adequate knowledge of the facts of\r\nvariation affords the only sure foundation for the Darwinian theory of\r\nthe origin of species, that this chapter has been written.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: _Foraminifera_, preface, p. x.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: _United States Geological Survey of the Territories_,\r\n1874.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: _Proceedings of the Entomological Society of London_,\r\n1875, p. vii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: _Ann. des Sci.

A\r\ngeneral sketch of the more important facts will, however, be given, for\r\nthe purpose of showing how closely they correspond with those described\r\nin the preceding chapter, and also to point out the general principles\r\nwhich they illustrate. It will also be necessary to explain how these\r\nvariations have been increased and accumulated by artificial selection,\r\nsince we are thereby better enabled to understand the action of natural\r\nselection, to be discussed in the succeeding chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The facts of Variation and Artificial Selection._\r\n\r\nEvery one knows that in each litter of kittens or of puppies no two are\r\nalike. Even in the case in which several are exactly alike in colours,\r\nother differences are always perceptible to those who observe them\r\nclosely. They will differ in size, in the proportions of their bodies\r\nand limbs, in the length or texture of their hairy covering, and notably\r\nin their disposition. They each possess, too, an individual\r\ncountenance, almost as varied when closely studied as that of a human\r\nbeing; not only can a shepherd distinguish every sheep in his flock, but\r\nwe all know that each kitten in the successive families of our old\r\nfavourite cat has a face of its own, with an expression and\r\nindividuality distinct from all its brothers and sisters. Now this\r\nindividual variability exists among all creatures whatever, which we can\r\nclosely observe, even when the two parents are very much alike and have\r\nbeen matched in order to preserve some special breed. The same thing\r\noccurs in the vegetable kingdom. All plants raised from seed differ more\r\nor less from each other. In every bed of flowers or of vegetables we\r\nshall find, if we look closely, that there are countless small\r\ndifferences, in the size, in the mode of growth, in the shape or colour\r\nof the leaves, in the form, colour, or markings of the flowers, or in\r\nthe size, form, colour, or flavour of the fruit. These differences are\r\nusually small, but are yet easily seen, and in their extremes are very\r\nconsiderable; and they have this important quality, that they have a\r\ntendency to be reproduced, and thus by careful breeding any particular\r\nvariation or group of variations can be increased to an enormous\r\nextent--apparently to any extent not incompatible with the life, growth,\r\nand reproduction of the plant or animal.\r\n\r\nThe way this is done is by artificial selection, and it is very\r\nimportant to understand this process and its results. Suppose we have a\r\nplant with a small edible seed, and we want to increase the size of that\r\nseed. We grow as large a quantity of it as possible, and when the crop\r\nis ripe we carefully choose a few of the very largest seeds, or we may\r\nby means of a sieve sort out a quantity of the largest seeds. Next year\r\nwe sow only these large seeds, taking care to give them suitable soil\r\nand manure, and the result is found to be that the _average_ size of the\r\nseeds is larger than in the first crop, and that the largest seeds are\r\nnow somewhat larger and more numerous. Again sowing these, we obtain a\r\nfurther slight increase of size, and in a very few years we obtain a\r\ngreatly improved race, which will always produce larger seeds than the\r\nunimproved race, even if cultivated without any special care. In this\r\nway all our fine sorts of vegetables, fruits, and flowers have been\r\nobtained, all our choice breeds of cattle or of poultry, our wonderful\r\nrace-horses, and our endless varieties of dogs. It is a very common but\r\nmistaken idea that this improvement is due to crossing and feeding in\r\nthe case of animals, and to improved cultivation in the case of plants.\r\nCrossing is occasionally used in order to obtain a combination of\r\nqualities found in two distinct breeds, and also because it is found to\r\nincrease the constitutional vigour; but every breed possessing any\r\nexceptional quality is the result of the selection of variations\r\noccurring year after year and accumulated in the manner just described.\r\nPurity of breed, with repeated selection of the best varieties of that\r\nbreed, is the foundation of all improvement in our domestic animals and\r\ncultivated plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Proofs of the Generality of Variation._\r\n\r\nAnother very common error is, that variation is the exception, and\r\nrather a rare exception, and that it occurs only in one direction at a\r\ntime--that is, that only one or two of the numerous possible modes of\r\nvariation occur at the same time. The experience of breeders and\r\ncultivators, however, proves that variation is the rule instead of the\r\nexception, and that it occurs, more or less, in almost every direction.\r\nThis is shown by the fact that different species of plants and animals\r\nhave required different _kinds_ of modification to adapt them to our\r\nuse, and we have never failed to meet with variation _in that particular\r\ndirection_, so as to enable us to accumulate it and so to produce\r\nultimately a large amount of change in the required direction. Our\r\ngardens furnish us with numberless examples of this property of plants.\r\nIn the cabbage and lettuce we have found variation in the size and mode\r\nof growth of the leaf, enabling us to produce by selection the almost\r\ninnumerable varieties, some with solid heads of foliage quite unlike any\r\nplant in a state of nature, others with curiously wrinkled leaves like\r\nthe savoy, others of a deep purple colour used for pickling. From the\r\nvery same species as the cabbage (Brassica oleracea) have arisen the\r\nbroccoli and cauliflower, in which the leaves have undergone little\r\nalteration, while the branching heads of flowers grow into a compact\r\nmass forming one of our most delicate vegetables. The brussels sprouts\r\nare another form of the same plant, in which the whole mode of growth\r\nhas been altered, numerous little heads of leaves being produced on the\r\nstem. In other varieties the ribs of the leaves are thickened so as to\r\nbecome themselves a culinary vegetable; while, in the Kohlrabi, the stem\r\ngrows into a turnip-like mass just above ground. Now all these\r\nextraordinarily distinct plants come from one original species which\r\nstill grows wild on our coasts; and it must have varied in all these\r\ndirections, otherwise variations could not have been accumulated to the\r\nextent we now see them. The flowers and seeds of all these plants have\r\nremained nearly stationary, because no attempt has been made to\r\naccumulate the slight variations that no doubt occur in them.\r\n\r\nIf now we turn to another set of plants, the turnips, radishes, carrots,\r\nand potatoes, we find that the roots or underground tubers have been\r\nwonderfully enlarged and improved, and also altered in shape and colour,\r\nwhile the stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits have remained almost\r\nunchanged. In the various kinds of peas and beans it is the pod or fruit\r\nand the seed that has been subjected to selection, and therefore greatly\r\nmodified; and it is here very important to notice that while all these\r\nplants have undergone cultivation in a great variety of soils and\r\nclimates, with different manures and under different systems, yet the\r\nflowers have remained but little altered, those of the broad bean, the\r\nscarlet-runner, and the garden-pea, being nearly the same in all the\r\nvarieties. This shows us how little change is produced by mere\r\ncultivation, or even by variety of soil and climate, if there is no\r\n_selection_ to preserve and accumulate the small variations that are\r\ncontinually occurring. When, however, a great amount of modification has\r\nbeen effected in one country, change to another country produces a\r\ndecided effect. Thus it has been found that some of the numerous\r\nvarieties of maize produced and cultivated in the United States change\r\nconsiderably, not only in their size and colour, but even in the shape\r\nof the seed when grown for a few successive years in Germany.[31] In all\r\nour cultivated fruit trees the fruits vary immensely in shape, size,\r\ncolour, flavour, time of ripening, and other qualities, while the leaves\r\nand flowers usually differ so little that they are hardly\r\ndistinguishable except to a very close observer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Variations of Apples and of Melons._\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable varieties are afforded by the apple and the melon,\r\nand some account of these will be given as illustrating the effects of\r\nslight variations accumulated by selection. All our apples are known to\r\nhave descended from the common crab of our hedges (Pyrus malus), and\r\nfrom this at least a thousand distinct varieties have been produced.\r\nThese differ greatly in the size and form of the fruit, in its colour,\r\nand in the texture of the skin. They further differ in the time of\r\nripening, in their flavour, and in their keeping properties; but apple\r\ntrees also differ in many other ways. The foliage of the different\r\nvarieties can often be distinguished by peculiarities of form and\r\ncolour, and it varies considerably in the time of its appearance; in\r\nsome hardly a leaf appears till the tree is in full bloom, while others\r\nproduce their leaves so early as almost to hide the flowers. The flowers\r\ndiffer in size and colour, and in one case in structure also, that of\r\nthe St. Valery apple having a double calyx with ten divisions, and\r\nfourteen styles with oblique stigmas, but without stamens or corolla.\r\nThe flowers, therefore, have to be fertilised with the pollen from other\r\nvarieties in order to produce fruit. The pips or seeds differ also in\r\nshape, size, and colour; some varieties are liable to canker more than\r\nothers, while the Winter Majetin and one or two others have the strange\r\nconstitutional peculiarity of never being attacked by the mealy bug even\r\nwhen all the other trees in the same orchard are infested with it.\r\n\r\nAll the cucumbers and gourds vary immensely, but the melon (Cucumis\r\nmelo) exceeds them all. A French botanist, M. Naudin, devoted six years\r\nto their study. He found that previous botanists had described thirty\r\ndistinct species, as they thought, which were really only varieties of\r\nmelons. They differ chiefly in their fruits, but also very much in\r\nfoliage and mode of growth. Some melons are only as large as small\r\nplums, others weigh as much as sixty-six pounds. One variety has a\r\nscarlet fruit. Another is not more than an inch in diameter, but\r\nsometimes more than a yard in length, twisting about in all directions\r\nlike a serpent. Some melons are exactly like cucumbers; and an Algerian\r\nvariety, when ripe, cracks and falls to pieces, just as occurs in a\r\nwild gourd (C. momordica).[32]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Variations of Flowers._\r\n\r\nTurning to flowers, we find that in the same genus as our currant and\r\ngooseberry, which we have cultivated for their fruits, there are some\r\nornamental species, as the Ribes sanguinea, and in these the flowers\r\nhave been selected so as to produce deep red, pink, or white varieties.\r\nWhen any particular flower becomes fashionable and is grown in large\r\nquantities, variations are always met with sufficient to produce great\r\nvarieties of tint or marking, as shown by our roses, auriculas, and\r\ngeraniums. When varied leaves are required, it is found that a number of\r\nplants vary sufficiently in this direction also, and we have zonal\r\ngeraniums, variegated ivies, gold and silver marked hollies, and many\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Variations of Domestic Animals._\r\n\r\nComing now to our domesticated animals, we find still more extraordinary\r\ncases; and it appears as if any special quality or modification in an\r\nanimal can be obtained if we only breed it in sufficient quantity, watch\r\ncarefully for the required variations, and carry on selection with\r\npatience and skill for a sufficiently long period. Thus, in sheep we\r\nhave enormously increased the wool, and have obtained the power of\r\nrapidly forming flesh and fat; in cows we have increased the production\r\nof milk; in horses we have obtained strength, endurance, or speed, and\r\nhave greatly modified size, form, and colour; in poultry we have secured\r\nvarious colours of plumage, increase of size, and almost perpetual\r\negg-laying. But it is in dogs and pigeons that the most marvellous\r\nchanges have been effected, and these require our special attention.\r\n\r\nOur various domestic dogs are believed to have originated from several\r\ndistinct wild species, because in every part of the world the native\r\ndogs resemble some wild dogs or wolves of the same country. Thus perhaps\r\nseveral species of wolves and jackals were domesticated in very early\r\ntimes, and from breeds derived from these, crossed and improved by\r\nselection, our existing dogs have descended. But this intermixture of\r\ndistinct species will go a very little way in accounting for the\r\npeculiarities of the different breeds of dogs, many of which are totally\r\nunlike any wild animal. Such is the case with greyhounds, bloodhounds,\r\nbulldogs, Blenheim spaniels, terriers, pugs, turnspits, pointers, and\r\nmany others; and these differ so greatly in size, shape, colour, and\r\nhabits, as well as in the form and proportions of all the different\r\nparts of the body, that it seems impossible that they could have\r\ndescended from any of the known wild dogs, wolves, or allied animals,\r\nnone of which differ nearly so much in size, form, and proportions. We\r\nhave here a remarkable proof that variation is not confined to\r\nsuperficial characters--to the colour, hair, or external appendages,\r\nwhen we see how the entire skeletons of such forms as the greyhound and\r\nthe bulldog have been gradually changed in opposite directions till they\r\nare both completely unlike that of any known wild animal, recent or\r\nextinct. These changes have been the result of some thousands of years\r\nof domestication and selection, different breeds being used and\r\npreserved for different purposes; but some of the best breeds are known\r\nto have been improved and perfected in modern times. About the middle of\r\nthe last century a new and improved kind of foxhound was produced; the\r\ngreyhound was also greatly improved at the end of the last century,\r\nwhile the true bulldog was brought to perfection about the same period.\r\nThe Newfoundland dog has been so much changed since it was first\r\nimported that it is now quite unlike any existing native dog in that\r\nisland.[33]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Domestic Pigeons._\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable and instructive example of variation produced by\r\nhuman selection is afforded by the various races and breeds of domestic\r\npigeons, not only because the variations produced are often most\r\nextraordinary in amount and diverse in character, but because in this\r\ncase there is no doubt whatever that all have been derived from one wild\r\nspecies, the common rock-pigeon (Columba livia). As this is a very\r\nimportant point it is well to state the evidence on which the belief is\r\nfounded. The wild rock-pigeon is of a slaty-blue colour, the tail has a\r\ndark band across the end, the wings have two black bands, and the outer\r\ntail-feathers are edged with white at the base. No other wild pigeon in\r\nthe world has this combination of characters. Now in every one of the\r\ndomestic varieties, even the most extreme, all the above marks, even to\r\nthe white edging of the outer tail-feathers, are sometimes found\r\nperfectly developed. When birds belonging to two distinct breeds are\r\ncrossed one or more times, neither of the parents being blue, or having\r\nany of the above-named marks, the mongrel offspring are very apt to\r\nacquire some of these characters. Mr. Darwin gives instances which he\r\nobserved himself. He crossed some white fantails with some black barbs,\r\nand the mongrels were black, brown, or mottled. He also crossed a barb\r\nwith a spot, which is a white bird with a red tail and red spot on the\r\nforehead, and the mongrel offspring were dusky and mottled. On now\r\ncrossing these two sets of mongrels with each other, he obtained a bird\r\nof a beautiful blue colour, with the barred and white edged tail, and\r\ndouble-banded wings, so as almost exactly to resemble a wild\r\nrock-pigeon. This bird was descended in the second generation from a\r\npure white and pure black bird, both of which when unmixed breed their\r\nkind remarkably true. These facts, well known to experienced\r\npigeon-fanciers, together with the habits of the birds, which all like\r\nto nest in holes, or dovecots, not in trees like the great majority of\r\nwild pigeons, have led to the general belief in the single origin of all\r\nthe different kinds.\r\n\r\nIn order to afford some idea of the great differences which exist among\r\ndomesticated pigeons, it will be well to give a brief abstract of Mr.\r\nDarwin's account of them. He divides them into eleven distinct races,\r\nmost of which have several sub-races.\r\n\r\nRACE I. _Pouters_.--These are especially distinguished by the enormously\r\nenlarged crop, which can be so inflated in some birds as almost to\r\nconceal the beak. They are very long in the body and legs and stand\r\nalmost upright, so as to present a very distinct appearance. Their\r\nskeleton has become modified, the ribs being broader and the vertebrae\r\nmore numerous than in other pigeons.\r\n\r\nRACE II. _Carriers_.--These are large, long-necked birds, with a long\r\npointed beak, and the eyes surrounded with a naked carunculated skin or\r\nwattle, which is also largely developed at the base of the beak. The\r\nopening of the mouth is unusually wide. There are several sub-races, one\r\nbeing called Dragons.\r\n\r\nRACE III. _Runts_.--These are very large-bodied, long-beaked pigeons,\r\nwith naked skin round the eyes. The wings are usually very long, the\r\nlegs long, and the feet large, and the skin of the neck is often red.\r\nThere are several sub-races, and these differ very much, forming a\r\nseries of links between the wild rock-pigeon and the carrier.\r\n\r\nRACE IV. _Barbs_.--These are remarkable for their very short and thick\r\nbeak, so unlike that of most pigeons that fanciers compare it with that\r\nof a bullfinch. They have also a naked carunculated skin round the eyes,\r\nand the skin over the nostrils swollen.\r\n\r\nRACE V. _Fantails_.--Short-bodied and rather small-beaked pigeons, with\r\nan enormously developed tail, consisting usually of from fourteen to\r\nforty feathers instead of twelve, the regular number in all other\r\npigeons, wild and tame. The tail spreads out like a fan and is usually\r\ncarried erect, and the bird bends back its slender neck, so that in\r\nhighly-bred varieties the head touches the tail. The feet are small, and\r\nthey walk stiffly.\r\n\r\nRACE VI. _Turbits and Owls_.--These are characterised by the feathers of\r\nthe middle of neck and breast in front spreading out irregularly so as\r\nto form a frill. The Turbits also have a crest on the head, and both\r\nhave the beak exceedingly short.\r\n\r\nRACE VII. _Tumblers_.--- These have a small body and short beak, but\r\nthey are specially distinguished by the singular habit of tumbling over\r\nbackwards during flight. One of the sub-races, the Indian Lotan or\r\nGround tumbler, if slightly shaken and placed on the ground, will\r\nimmediately begin tumbling head over heels until taken up and soothed.\r\nIf not taken up, some of them will go on tumbling till they die. Some\r\nEnglish tumblers are almost equally persistent. A writer, quoted by Mr.\r\nDarwin, says that these birds generally begin to tumble almost as soon\r\nas they can fly; \"at three months old they tumble well, but still fly\r\nstrong; at five or six months they tumble excessively; and in the second\r\nyear they mostly give up flying, on account of their tumbling so much\r\nand so close to the ground. Some fly round with the flock, throwing a\r\nclean summersault every few yards till they are obliged to settle from\r\ngiddiness and exhaustion. These are called Air-tumblers, and they\r\ncommonly throw from twenty to thirty summersaults in a minute, each\r\nclear and clean. I have one red cock that I have on two or three\r\noccasions timed by my watch, and counted forty summersaults in the\r\nminute. At first they throw a single summersault, then it is double,\r\ntill it becomes a continuous roll, which puts an end to flying, for if\r\nthey fly a few yards over they go, and roll till they reach the ground.\r\nThus I had one kill herself, and another broke his leg. Many of them\r\nturn over only a few inches from the ground, and will tumble two or\r\nthree times in flying across their loft. These are called House-tumblers\r\nfrom tumbling in the house. The act of tumbling seems to be one over\r\nwhich they have no control, an involuntary movement which they seem to\r\ntry to prevent. I have seen a bird sometimes in his struggles fly a yard\r\nor two straight upwards, the impulse forcing him backwards while he\r\nstruggles to go forwards.\"[34]\r\n\r\nThe Short-faced tumblers are an improved sub-race which have almost lost\r\nthe power of tumbling, but are valued for possessing some other\r\ncharacteristics in an extreme degree. They are very small, have almost\r\nglobular heads, and a very minute beak, so that fanciers say the head of\r\na perfect bird should resemble a cherry with a barleycorn stuck in it.\r\nSome of these weigh less than seven ounces, whereas the wild rock-pigeon\r\nweighs about fourteen ounces. The feet, too, are very short and small,\r\nand the middle toe has twelve or thirteen instead of fourteen or fifteen\r\nscutellae. They have often only nine primary wing-feathers instead of\r\nten as in all other pigeons.\r\n\r\nRACE VIII. _Indian Frill-back_.--In these birds the beak is very short,\r\nand the feathers of the whole body are reversed or turn backwards.\r\n\r\nRACE IX. _Jacobin_.--These curious birds have a hood of feathers almost\r\nenclosing the head and meeting in front of the neck. The wings and tail\r\nare unusually long.\r\n\r\nRACE X. _Trumpeter_.--Distinguished by a tuft of feathers curling\r\nforwards over the beak, and the feet very much feathered. They obtain\r\ntheir name from the peculiar voice unlike that of any other pigeon. The\r\ncoo is rapidly repeated, and is continued for several minutes. The feet\r\nare covered with feathers so large as often to appear like little wings.\r\n\r\nRACE XI. comprises _Laughers_, _Frill-backs_, _Nuns_, _Spots_, _and\r\nSwallows_.--They are all very like the common rock-pigeon, but have each\r\nsome slight peculiarity. The Laughers have a peculiar voice, supposed to\r\nresemble a laugh. The Nuns are white, with the head, tail, and primary\r\nwing-feathers black or red. The Spots are white, with the tail and a\r\nspot on the forehead red. The Swallows are slender, white in colour,\r\nwith the head and wings of some darker colour.\r\n\r\nBesides these races and sub-races a number of other kinds have been\r\ndescribed, and about one hundred and fifty varieties can be\r\ndistinguished. It is interesting to note that almost every part of the\r\nbird, whose variations can be noted and selected, has led to variations\r\nof a considerable extent, and many of these have necessitated changes in\r\nthe plumage and in the skeleton quite as great as any that occur in the\r\nnumerous distinct species of large genera. The form of the skull and\r\nbeak varies enormously, so that the skulls of the Short-faced tumbler\r\nand some of the Carriers differ more than any wild pigeons, even those\r\nclassed in distinct genera. The breadth and number of the ribs vary, as\r\nwell as the processes on them; the number of the vertebrae and the\r\nlength of the sternum also vary; and the perforations in the sternum\r\nvary in size and shape. The oil gland varies in development, and is\r\nsometimes absent. The number of the wing-feathers varies, and those of\r\nthe tail to an enormous extent. The proportions of the leg and feet and\r\nthe number of the scutellae also vary. The eggs also vary somewhat in\r\nsize and shape; and the amount of downy clothing on the young bird, when\r\nfirst hatched, differs very considerably. Finally, the attitude of the\r\nbody, the manner of walking, the mode of flight, and the voice, all\r\nexhibit modifications of the most remarkable kind.[35]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Acclimatisation_.\r\n\r\nA very important kind of variation is that constitutional change termed\r\nacclimatisation, which enables any organism to become gradually adapted\r\nto a different climate from the parent stock. As closely allied species\r\noften inhabit different countries possessing very different climates, we\r\nshould expect to find cases illustrating this change among our\r\ndomesticated animals and cultivated plants. A few examples will\r\ntherefore be adduced showing that such constitutional variation does\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nAmong animals the cases are not numerous, because no systematic attempt\r\nhas been made to select varieties for this special quality. It has,\r\nhowever, been observed that, though no European dogs thrive well in\r\nIndia, the Newfoundland dog, originating from a severe climate, can\r\nhardly be kept alive. A better case, perhaps, is furnished by merino\r\nsheep, which, when imported directly from England, do not thrive, while\r\nthose which have been bred in the intermediate climate of the Cape of\r\nGood Hope do much better. When geese were first introduced into Bogota,\r\nthey laid few eggs at long intervals, and few of the young survived. By\r\ndegrees, however, the fecundity improved, and in about twenty years\r\nbecame equal to what it is in Europe. According to Garcilaso, when fowls\r\nwere first introduced into Peru they were not fertile, whereas now they\r\nare as much so as in Europe.\r\n\r\nPlants furnish much more important evidence. Our nurserymen distinguish\r\nin their catalogues varieties of fruit-trees which are more or less\r\nhardy, and this is especially the case in America, where certain\r\nvarieties only will stand the severe climate of Canada. There is one\r\nvariety of pear, the Forelle, which both in England and France withstood\r\nfrosts that killed the flowers and buds of all other kinds of pears.\r\nWheat, which is grown over so large a portion of the world, has become\r\nadapted to special climates. Wheat imported from India and sown in good\r\nwheat soil in England produced the most meagre ears; while wheat taken\r\nfrom France to the West Indian Islands produced either wholly barren\r\nspikes or spikes furnished with two or three miserable seeds, while West\r\nIndian seed by its side yielded an enormous harvest. The orange was very\r\ntender when first introduced into Italy, and continued so as long as it\r\nwas propagated by grafts, but when trees were raised from seed many of\r\nthese were found to be hardier, and the orange is now perfectly\r\nacclimatised in Italy. Sweet-peas (Lathyrus odoratus) imported from\r\nEngland to the Calcutta Botanic Gardens produced few blossoms and no\r\nseed; those from France flowered a little better, but still produced no\r\nseed, but plants raised from seed brought from Darjeeling in the\r\nHimalayas, but originally derived from England, flower and seed\r\nprofusely in Calcutta.[36]\r\n\r\nAn observation by Mr. Darwin himself is perhaps even more instructive.\r\nHe says: \"On 24th May 1864 there was a severe frost in Kent, and two\r\nrows of scarlet runners (Phaseolus multiflorus) in my garden, containing\r\n390 plants of the same age and equally exposed, were all blackened and\r\nkilled except about a dozen plants. In an adjoining row of Fulmer's\r\ndwarf bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) one single plant escaped. A still more\r\nsevere frost occurred four days afterwards, and of the dozen plants\r\nwhich had previously escaped only three survived; these were not taller\r\nor more vigorous than the other young plants, but they escaped\r\ncompletely, with not even the tips of their leaves browned. It was\r\nimpossible to behold these three plants, with their blackened, withered,\r\nand dead brethren all around them, and not see at a glance that they\r\ndiffered widely in their constitutional power of resisting frost.\"\r\n\r\nThe preceding sketch of the variation that occurs among domestic animals\r\nand cultivated plants shows how wide it is in range and how great in\r\namount; and we have good reason to believe that similar variation\r\nextends to all organised beings. In the class of fishes, for example, we\r\nhave one kind which has been long domesticated in the East, the gold\r\nand silver carps; and these present great variation, not only of colour\r\nbut in the form and structure of the fins and other external organs. In\r\nlike manner, the only domesticated insects, hive bees and silkworm\r\nmoths, present numbers of remarkable varieties which have been produced\r\nby the selection of chance variations just as in the case of plants and\r\nthe higher animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Circumstances favourable to Selection by Man._\r\n\r\nIt may be supposed, that the systematic selection which has been\r\nemployed for the purpose of improving the races of animals or plants\r\nuseful to man is of comparatively recent origin, though some of the\r\ndifferent races are known to have been in existence in very early times.\r\nBut Mr. Darwin has pointed out, that unconscious selection must have\r\nbegun to produce an effect as soon as plants were cultivated or animals\r\ndomesticated by man. It would have been very soon observed that animals\r\nand plants produced their like, that seed of early wheat produced early\r\nwheat, that the offspring of very swift dogs were also swift, and as\r\nevery one would try to have a good rather than a bad sort this would\r\nnecessarily lead to the slow but steady improvement of all useful plants\r\nand animals subject to man's care. Soon there would arise distinct\r\nbreeds, owing to the varying uses to which the animals and plants were\r\nput. Dogs would be wanted chiefly to hunt one kind of game in one part\r\nof the country and another kind elsewhere; for one purpose scent would\r\nbe more important, for another swiftness, for another strength and\r\ncourage, for yet another watchfulness and intelligence, and this would\r\nsoon lead to the formation of very distinct races. In the case of\r\nvegetables and fruits, different varieties would be found to succeed\r\nbest in certain soils and climates; some might be preferred on account\r\nof the quantity of food they produced, others for their sweetness and\r\ntenderness, while others might be more useful on account of their\r\nripening at a particular season, and thus again distinct varieties would\r\nbe established. An instance of unconscious selection leading to distinct\r\nresults in modern times is afforded by two flocks of Leicester sheep\r\nwhich both originated from the same stock, and were then bred pure for\r\nupwards of fifty years by two gentlemen, Mr. Buckley and Mr. Burgess.\r\nMr. Youatt, one of the greatest authorities on breeding domestic\r\nanimals, says: \"There is not a suspicion existing in the mind of any one\r\nat all acquainted with the subject that the owner of either of them has\r\ndeviated in any one instance from the pure blood of Mr. Bakewell's\r\noriginal flock, and yet the difference between the sheep possessed by\r\nthese two gentlemen is so great that they have the appearance of being\r\nquite different varieties.\" In this case there was no desire to deviate\r\nfrom the original breed, and the difference must have arisen from some\r\nslight difference of taste or judgment in selecting, each year, the\r\nparents for the next year's stock, combined perhaps with some direct\r\neffect of the slight differences of climate and soil on the two farms.\r\n\r\nMost of our domesticated animals and cultivated plants have come to us\r\nfrom the earliest seats of civilisation in Western Asia or Egypt, and\r\nhave therefore been the subjects of human care and selection for some\r\nthousands of years, the result being that, in many cases, we do not know\r\nthe wild stock from which they originally sprang. The horse, the camel,\r\nand the common bull and cow are nowhere found in a wild state, and they\r\nhave all been domesticated from remote antiquity. The original of the\r\ndomestic fowl is still wild in India and the Malay Islands, and it was\r\ndomesticated in India and China before 1400 B.C. It was introduced into\r\nEurope about 600 B.C. Several distinct breeds were known to the Romans\r\nabout the commencement of the Christian era, and they have since spread\r\nall over the civilised world and been subjected to a vast amount of\r\nconscious and unconscious selection, to many varieties of climate and to\r\ndifferences of food; the result being seen in the wonderful diversity of\r\nbreeds which differ quite as remarkably as do the different races of\r\npigeons already described.\r\n\r\nIn the vegetable kingdom, most of the cereals--wheat, barley, etc.--are\r\nunknown as truly wild plants; and the same is the case with many\r\nvegetables, for De Candolle states that out of 157 useful cultivated\r\nplants thirty-two are quite unknown in a wild state, and that forty more\r\nare of doubtful origin. It is not improbable that most of these do exist\r\nwild, but they have been so profoundly changed by thousands of years of\r\ncultivation as to be quite unrecognisable. The peach is unknown in a\r\nwild state, unless it is derived from the common almond, on which point\r\nthere is much difference of opinion among botanists and horticulturists.\r\n\r\nThe immense antiquity of most of our cultivated plants sufficiently\r\nexplains the apparent absence of such useful productions in Australia\r\nand the Cape of Good Hope, notwithstanding that they both possess an\r\nexceedingly rich and varied flora. These countries having been, until a\r\ncomparatively recent period, inhabited only by uncivilised men, neither\r\ncultivation nor selection has been carried on for a sufficiently long\r\ntime. In North America, however, where there was evidently a very\r\nancient if low form of civilisation, as indicated by the remarkable\r\nmounds, earthworks, and other prehistoric remains, maize was cultivated,\r\nthough it was probably derived from Peru; and the ancient civilisation\r\nof that country and of Mexico has given rise to no fewer than\r\nthirty-three useful cultivated plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conditions favourable to the production of Variations._\r\n\r\nIn order that plants and animals may be improved and modified to any\r\nconsiderable extent, it is of course essential that suitable variations\r\nshould occur with tolerable frequency. There seem to be three conditions\r\nwhich are especially favourable to the production of variations: (1)\r\nThat the particular species or variety should be kept in very large\r\nnumbers; (2) that it should be spread over a wide area and thus\r\nsubjected to a considerable diversity of physical conditions; and (3)\r\nthat it should be occasionally crossed with some distinct but closely\r\nallied race. The first of these conditions is perhaps the most\r\nimportant, the chance of variations of any particular kind being\r\nincreased in proportion to the quantity of the original stock and of its\r\nannual offspring. It has been remarked that only those breeders who keep\r\nlarge flocks can effect much improvement; and it is for the same reason\r\nthat pigeons and fowls, which can be so easily and rapidly increased,\r\nand which have been kept in such large numbers by so great a number of\r\npersons, have produced such strange and numerous varieties. In like\r\nmanner, nurserymen who grow fruit and flowers in large quantities have a\r\ngreat advantage over private amateurs in the production of new\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nAlthough I believe, for reasons which will be given further on, that\r\nsome amount of variability is a constant and necessary property of all\r\norganisms, yet there appears to be good evidence to show that changed\r\nconditions of life tend to increase it, both by a direct action on the\r\norganisation and by indirectly affecting the reproductive system. Hence\r\nthe extension of civilisation, by favouring domestication under altered\r\nconditions, facilitates the process of modification. Yet this change\r\ndoes not seem to be an essential condition, for nowhere has the\r\nproduction of extreme varieties of plants and flowers been carried\r\nfarther than in Japan, where careful selection continued for many\r\ngenerations must have been the chief factor. The effect of occasional\r\ncrosses often results in a great amount of variation, but it also leads\r\nto instability of character, and is therefore very little employed in\r\nthe production of fixed and well-marked races. For this purpose, in\r\nfact, it has to be carefully avoided, as it is only by isolation and\r\npure breeding that any specially desired qualities can be increased by\r\nselection. It is for this reason that among savage peoples, whose\r\nanimals run half wild, little improvement takes place; and the\r\ndifficulty of isolation also explains why distinct and pure breeds of\r\ncats are so rarely met with. The wide distribution of useful animals and\r\nplants from a very remote epoch has, no doubt, been a powerful cause of\r\nmodification, because the particular breed first introduced into each\r\ncountry has often been kept pure for many years, and has also been\r\nsubjected to slight differences of conditions. It will also usually have\r\nbeen selected for a somewhat different purpose in each locality, and\r\nthus very distinct races would soon originate.\r\n\r\nThe important physiological effects of crossing breeds or strains, and\r\nthe part this plays in the economy of nature, will be explained in a\r\nfuture chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Concluding Remarks._\r\n\r\nThe examples of variation now adduced--and these might have been almost\r\nindefinitely increased--will suffice to show that there is hardly an\r\norgan or a quality in plants or animals which has not been observed to\r\nvary; and further, that whenever any of these variations have been\r\nuseful to man he has been able to increase them to a marvellous extent\r\nby the simple process of always preserving the best varieties to breed\r\nfrom. Along with these larger variations others of smaller amount\r\noccasionally appear, sometimes in external, sometimes in internal\r\ncharacters, the very bones of the skeleton often changing slightly in\r\nform, size, or number; but as these secondary characters have been of no\r\nuse to man, and have not been specially selected by him, they have,\r\nusually, not been developed to any great amount except when they have\r\nbeen closely dependent on those external characters which he has largely\r\nmodified.\r\n\r\nAs man has considered only utility to himself, or the satisfaction of\r\nhis love of beauty, of novelty, or merely of something strange or\r\namusing, the variations he has thus produced have something of the\r\ncharacter of monstrosities. Not only are they often of no use to the\r\nanimals or plants themselves, but they are not unfrequently injurious to\r\nthem. In the Tumbler pigeons, for instance, the habit of tumbling is\r\nsometimes so excessive as to injure or kill the bird; and many of our\r\nhighly-bred animals have such delicate constitutions that they are very\r\nliable to disease, while their extreme peculiarities of form or\r\nstructure would often render them quite unfit to live in a wild state.\r\nIn plants, many of our double flowers, and some fruits, have lost the\r\npower of producing seed, and the race can thus be continued only by\r\nmeans of cuttings or grafts. This peculiar character of domestic\r\nproductions distinguishes them broadly from wild species and varieties,\r\nwhich, as will be seen by and by, are necessarily adapted in every part\r\nof their organisation to the conditions under which they have to live.\r\nTheir importance for our present inquiry depends on their demonstrating\r\nthe occurrence of incessant slight variations in all parts of an\r\norganism, with the transmission to the offspring of the special\r\ncharacteristics of the parents; and also, that all such slight\r\nvariations are capable of being accumulated by selection till they\r\npresent very large and important divergencies from the ancestral stock.\r\n\r\nWe thus see, that the evidence as to variation afforded by animals and\r\nplants under domestication strikingly accords with that which we have\r\nproved to exist in a state of nature. And it is not at all surprising\r\nthat it should be so, since all the species were in a state of nature\r\nwhen first domesticated or cultivated by man, and whatever variations\r\noccur must be due to purely natural causes. Moreover, on comparing the\r\nvariations which occur in any one generation of domesticated animals\r\nwith those which we know to occur in wild animals, we find no evidence\r\nof greater individual variation in the former than in the latter. The\r\nresults of man's selection are more striking to us because we have\r\nalways considered the varieties of each domestic animal to be\r\nessentially identical, while those which we observe in a wild state are\r\nheld to be essentially diverse. The greyhound and the spaniel seem\r\nwonderful, as varieties of one animal produced by man's selection; while\r\nwe think little of the diversities of the fox and the wolf, or the horse\r\nand the zebra, because we have been accustomed to look upon them as\r\nradically distinct animals, not as the results of nature's selection of\r\nthe varieties of a common ancestor.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Darwin, _Animals and Plants under Domestication_, vol. i.\r\np. 322.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: These facts are taken from Darwin's _Domesticated Animals\r\nand Cultivated Plants_, vol. i. pp. 359, 360, 392-401; vol. ii. pp. 231,\r\n275, 330.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: See Darwin's _Animals and Plants under Domestication_,\r\nvol. i. pp. 40-42.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: Mr. Brent in _Journal of Horticulture_, 1861, p. 76;\r\nquoted by Darwin, _Animals and Plants under Domestication_, vol. i. p.\r\n151.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: This account of domestic pigeons is greatly condensed from\r\nMr. Darwin's work already referred to.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: _Animals and Plants under Domestication_, vol. ii. pp.\r\n307-311.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nNATURAL SELECTION BY VARIATION AND SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\r\n\r\n\r\n    Effect of struggle for existence under unchanged conditions--The\r\n    effect under change of conditions--Divergence of character--In\r\n    insects--In birds--In mammalia--Divergence leads to a maximum of\r\n    life in each area--Closely allied species inhabit distinct\r\n    areas--Adaptation to conditions at various periods of life--The\r\n    continued existence of low forms of life--Extinction of low\r\n    types among the higher animals--Circumstances favourable to the\r\n    origin of new species--Probable origin of the dippers--The\r\n    importance of isolation--On the advance of organisation by\r\n    natural selection--Summary of the first five chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapters we have accumulated a body of facts and\r\narguments which will enable us now to deal with the very core of our\r\nsubject--the formation of species by means of natural selection. We have\r\nseen how tremendous is the struggle for existence always going on in\r\nnature owing to the great powers of increase of all organisms; we have\r\nascertained the fact of variability extending to every part and organ,\r\neach of which varies simultaneously and for the most part independently;\r\nand we have seen that this variability is both large in its amount in\r\nproportion to the size of each part, and usually affects a considerable\r\nproportion of the individuals in the large and dominant species. And,\r\nlastly, we have seen how similar variations, occurring in cultivated\r\nplants and domestic animals, are capable of being perpetuated and\r\naccumulated by artificial selection, till they have resulted in all the\r\nwonderful varieties of our fruits, flowers, and vegetables, our domestic\r\nanimals and household pets, many of which differ from each other far\r\nmore in external characters, habits, and instincts than do species in a\r\nstate of nature. We have now to inquire whether there is any analogous\r\nprocess in nature, by which wild animals and plants can be permanently\r\nmodified and new races or new species produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Effect of Struggle for Existence under Unchanged Conditions._\r\n\r\nLet us first consider what will be the effect of the struggle for\r\nexistence upon the animals and plants which we see around us, under\r\nconditions which do not perceptibly vary from year to year or from\r\ncentury to century. We have seen that every species is exposed to\r\nnumerous and varied dangers throughout its entire existence, and that it\r\nis only by means of the exact adaptation of its organisation--including\r\nits instincts and habits--to its surroundings that it is enabled to live\r\ntill it produces offspring which may take its place when it ceases to\r\nexist. We have seen also that, of the whole annual increase only a very\r\nsmall fraction survives; and though the survival in individual cases may\r\nsometimes be due rather to accident than to any real superiority, yet we\r\ncannot doubt that, in the long run, those survive which are best fitted\r\nby their perfect organisation to escape the dangers that surround them.\r\nThis \"survival of the fittest\" is what Darwin termed \"natural\r\nselection,\" because it leads to the same results in nature as are\r\nproduced by man's selection among domestic animals and cultivated\r\nplants. Its primary effect will, clearly, be to keep each species in the\r\nmost perfect health and vigour, with every part of its organisation in\r\nfull harmony with the conditions of its existence. It prevents any\r\npossible deterioration in the organic world, and produces that\r\nappearance of exuberant life and enjoyment, of health and beauty, that\r\naffords us so much pleasure, and which might lead a superficial observer\r\nto suppose that peace and quietude reigned throughout nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Effect under changed Conditions._\r\n\r\nBut the very same process which, so long as conditions remain\r\nsubstantially the same, secures the continuance of each species of\r\nanimal or plant in its full perfection, will usually, under changed\r\nconditions, bring about whatever change of structure or habits may be\r\nnecessitated by them. The changed conditions to which we refer are such\r\nas we know have occurred throughout all geological time and in every\r\npart of the world. Land and water have been continually shifting their\r\npositions; some regions are undergoing subsidence with diminution of\r\narea, others elevation with extension of area; dry land has been\r\nconverted into marshes, while marshes have been drained or have even\r\nbeen elevated into plateaux. Climate too has changed again and again,\r\neither through the elevation of mountains in high latitudes leading to\r\nthe accumulation of snow and ice, or by a change in the direction of\r\nwinds and ocean currents produced by the subsidence or elevation of\r\nlands which connected continents and divided oceans. Again, along with\r\nall these changes have come not less important changes in the\r\ndistribution of species. Vegetation has been greatly modified by changes\r\nof climate and of altitude; while every union of lands before separated\r\nhas led to extensive migrations of animals into new countries,\r\ndisturbing the balance that before existed among its forms of life,\r\nleading to the extermination of some species and the increase of others.\r\n\r\nWhen such physical changes as these have taken place, it is evident that\r\nmany species must either become modified or cease to exist. When the\r\nvegetation has changed in character the herbivorous animals must become\r\nable to live on new and perhaps less nutritious food; while the change\r\nfrom a damp to a dry climate may necessitate migration at certain\r\nperiods to escape destruction by drought. This will expose the species\r\nto new dangers, and require special modifications of structure to meet\r\nthem. Greater swiftness, increased cunning, nocturnal habits, change of\r\ncolour, or the power of climbing trees and living for a time on their\r\nfoliage or fruit, may be the means adopted by different species to bring\r\nthemselves into harmony with the new conditions; and by the continued\r\nsurvival of those individuals, only, which varied sufficiently in the\r\nright direction, the necessary modifications of structure or of function\r\nwould be brought about, just as surely as man has been able to breed the\r\ngreyhound to hunt by sight and the foxhound by scent, or has produced\r\nfrom the same wild plant such distinct forms as the cauliflower and the\r\nbrussels sprouts.\r\n\r\nWe will now consider the special characteristics of the changes in\r\nspecies that are likely to be effected, and how far they agree with what\r\nwe observe in nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Divergence of Character._\r\n\r\nIn species which have a wide range the struggle for existence will often\r\ncause some individuals or groups of individuals to adopt new habits in\r\norder to seize upon vacant places in nature where the struggle is less\r\nsevere. Some, living among extensive marshes, may adopt a more aquatic\r\nmode of life; others, living where forests abound, may become more\r\narboreal. In either case we cannot doubt that the changes of structure\r\nneeded to adapt them to their new habits would soon be brought about,\r\nbecause we know that variations in all the external organs and all their\r\nseparate parts are very abundant and are also considerable in amount.\r\nThat such divergence of character has actually occurred we have some\r\ndirect evidence. Mr. Darwin informs us that in the Catskill Mountains in\r\nthe United States there are two varieties of wolves, one with a light\r\ngreyhound-like form which pursues deer, the other more bulky with\r\nshorter legs, which more frequently attacks sheep.[37] Another good\r\nexample is that of the insects in the island of Madeira, many of which\r\nhave either lost their wings or have had them so much reduced as to be\r\nuseless for flight, while the very same species on the continent of\r\nEurope possess fully developed wings. In other cases the wingless\r\nMadeira species are distinct from, but closely allied to, winged species\r\nof Europe. The explanation of this change is, that Madeira, like many\r\noceanic islands in the temperate zone, is much exposed to sudden gales\r\nof wind, and as most of the fertile land is on the coast, insects which\r\nflew much would be very liable to be blown out to sea and lost. Year\r\nafter year, therefore, those individuals which had shorter wings, or\r\nwhich used them least, were preserved; and thus, in time, terrestrial,\r\nwingless, or imperfectly winged races or species have been produced.\r\nThat this is the true explanation of this singular fact is proved by\r\nmuch corroborative evidence. There are some few flower-frequenting\r\ninsects in Madeira to whom wings are essential, and in these the wings\r\nare somewhat larger than in the same species on the mainland. We thus\r\nsee that there is no general tendency to the abortion of wings in\r\nMadeira, but that it is simply a case of adaptation to new conditions.\r\nThose insects to whom wings were not absolutely essential escaped a\r\nserious danger by not using them, and the wings therefore became reduced\r\nor were completely lost. But when they were essential they were enlarged\r\nand strengthened, so that the insect could battle against the winds and\r\nsave itself from destruction at sea. Many flying insects, not varying\r\nfast enough, would be destroyed before they could establish themselves,\r\nand thus we may explain the total absence from Madeira of several whole\r\nfamilies of winged insects which must have had many opportunities of\r\nreaching the islands. Such are the large groups of the tiger-beetles\r\n(Cicindelidae), the chafers (Melolonthidae), the click-beetles\r\n(Elateridae), and many others.\r\n\r\nBut the most curious and striking confirmation of this portion of Mr.\r\nDarwin's theory is afforded by the case of Kerguelen Island. This island\r\nwas visited by the _Transit of Venus_ expedition. It is one of the\r\nstormiest places on the globe, being subject to almost perpetual gales,\r\nwhile, there being no wood, it is almost entirely without shelter. The\r\nRev. A.E. Eaton, an experienced entomologist, was naturalist to the\r\nexpedition, and he assiduously collected the few insects that were to be\r\nfound. All were incapable of flight, and most of them entirely without\r\nwings. They included a moth, several flies, and numerous beetles. As\r\nthese insects could hardly have reached the islands in a wingless state,\r\neven if there were any other known land inhabited by them--which there\r\nis not--we must assume that, like the Madeiran insects, they were\r\noriginally winged, and lost their power of flight because its possession\r\nwas injurious to them.\r\n\r\nIt is no doubt due to the same cause that some butterflies on small and\r\nexposed islands have their wings reduced in size, as is strikingly the\r\ncase with the small tortoise-shell butterfly (Vanessa urticae)\r\ninhabiting the Isle of Man, which is only about half the size of the\r\nsame species in England or Ireland; and Mr. Wollaston notes that Vanessa\r\ncallirhoe--a closely allied South European form of our red-admiral\r\nbutterfly--is permanently smaller in the small and bare island of Porto\r\nSanto than in the larger and more wooded adjacent island of Madeira.\r\n\r\nA very good example of comparatively recent divergence of character, in\r\naccordance with new conditions of life, is afforded by our red grouse.\r\nThis bird, the Lagopus scoticus of naturalists, is entirely confined to\r\nthe British Isles. It is, however, very closely allied to the willow\r\ngrouse (Lagopus albus), a bird which ranges all over Europe, Northern\r\nAsia, and North America, but which, unlike our species, changes to white\r\nin winter. No difference in form or structure can be detected between\r\nthe two birds, but as they differ so decidedly in colour--our species\r\nbeing usually rather darker in winter than in summer, while there are\r\nalso slight differences in the call-note and in habits,--the two species\r\nare generally considered to be distinct. The differences, however, are\r\nso clearly adaptations to changed conditions that we can hardly doubt\r\nthat, during the early part of the glacial period, when our islands were\r\nunited to the continent, our grouse was identical with that of the rest\r\nof Europe. But when the cold passed away and our islands became\r\npermanently separated from the mainland, with a mild and equable climate\r\nand very little snow in winter, the change to white at that season\r\nbecame hurtful, rendering the birds more conspicuous instead of serving\r\nas a means of concealment. The colour was, therefore, gradually changed\r\nby the process of variation and natural selection; and as the birds\r\nobtained ample shelter among the heather which clothes so many of our\r\nmoorlands, it became useful for them to assimilate with its brown and\r\ndusky stems and withered flowers rather than with the snow of the higher\r\nmountains. An interesting confirmation of this change having really\r\noccurred is afforded by the occasional occurrence in Scotland of birds\r\nwith a considerable amount of white in the winter plumage. This is\r\nconsidered to be a case of reversion to the ancestral type, just as the\r\nslaty colours and banded wings of the wild rock-pigeon sometimes\r\nreappear in our fancy breeds of domestic pigeons.[38]\r\n\r\nThe principle of \"divergence of character\" pervades all nature from the\r\nlowest groups to the highest, as may be well seen in the class of birds.\r\nAmong our native species we see it well marked in the different species\r\nof titmice, pipits, and chats. The great titmouse (Parus major) by its\r\nlarger size and stronger bill is adapted to feed on larger insects, and\r\nis even said sometimes to kill small and weak birds. The smaller and\r\nweaker coal titmouse (Parus ater) has adopted a more vegetarian diet,\r\neating seeds as well as insects, and feeding on the ground as well as\r\namong trees. The delicate little blue titmouse (Parus coeruleus), with\r\nits very small bill, feeds on the minutest insects and grubs which it\r\nextracts from crevices of bark and from the buds of fruit-trees. The\r\nmarsh titmouse, again (Parus palustris), has received its name from the\r\nlow and marshy localities it frequents; while the crested titmouse\r\n(Parus cristatus) is a northern bird frequenting especially pine\r\nforests, on the seeds of which trees it partially feeds. Then, again,\r\nour three common pipits--the tree-pipit (Anthus arboreus), the\r\nmeadow-pipit (Anthus pratensis), and the rock-pipit or sea-lark (Anthus\r\nobscurus) have each occupied a distinct place in nature to which they\r\nhave become specially adapted, as indicated by the different form and\r\nsize of the hind toe and claw in each species. So, the stone-chat\r\n(Saxicola rubicola), the whin-chat (S. rubetra), and the wheat-ear (S.\r\noenanthe) are more or less divergent forms of one type, with\r\nmodifications in the shape of the wing, feet, and bill adapting them to\r\nslightly different modes of life. The whin-chat is the smallest, and\r\nfrequents furzy commons, fields, and lowlands, feeding on worms,\r\ninsects, small molluscs, and berries; the stone-chat is next in size,\r\nand is especially active and lively, frequenting heaths and uplands, and\r\nis a permanent resident with us, the two other species being migrants;\r\nwhile the larger and more conspicuous wheat-ear, besides feeding on\r\ngrubs, beetles, etc., is able to capture flying insects on the wing,\r\nsomething after the manner of true flycatchers.\r\n\r\nThese examples sufficiently indicate how divergence of character has\r\nacted, and has led to the adaptation of numerous allied species, each to\r\na more or less special mode of life, with the variety of food, of\r\nhabits, and of enemies which must necessarily accompany such diversity.\r\nAnd when we extend our inquiries to higher groups we find the same\r\nindications of divergence and special adaptation, often to a still more\r\nmarked extent. Thus we have the larger falcons, which prey upon birds,\r\nwhile some of the smaller species, like the hobby (Falco subbuteo), live\r\nlargely on insects. The true falcons capture their prey in the air,\r\nwhile the hawks usually seize it on or near the ground, feeding on\r\nhares, rabbits, squirrels, grouse, pigeons, and poultry. Kites and\r\nbuzzards, on the other hand, seize their prey upon the ground, and the\r\nformer feed largely on reptiles and offal as well as on birds and\r\nquadrupeds. Others have adopted fish as their chief food, and the osprey\r\nsnatches its prey from the water with as much facility as a gull or a\r\npetrel; while the South American caracaras (Polyborus) have adopted the\r\nhabits of vultures and live altogether on carrion. In every great group\r\nthere is the same divergence of habits. There are ground-pigeons,\r\nrock-pigeons, and wood-pigeons,--seed-eating pigeons and fruit-eating\r\npigeons; there are carrion-eating, insect-eating, and fruit-eating\r\ncrows. Even kingfishers are, some aquatic, some terrestrial in their\r\nhabits; some live on fish, some on insects, some on reptiles. Lastly,\r\namong the primary divisions of birds we find a purely terrestrial\r\ngroup--the Ratitae, including the ostriches, cassowaries, etc.; other\r\ngreat groups, including the ducks, cormorants, gulls, penguins, etc.,\r\nare aquatic; while the bulk of the Passerine birds are aerial and\r\narboreal. The same general facts can be detected in all other classes of\r\nanimals. In the mammalia, for example, we have in the common rat a\r\nfish-eater and flesh-eater as well as a grain-eater, which has no doubt\r\nhelped to give it the power of spreading over the world and driving away\r\nthe native rats of other countries. Throughout the Rodent tribe we find\r\neverywhere aquatic, terrestrial, and arboreal forms. In the weasel and\r\ncat tribes some live more in trees, others on the ground; squirrels have\r\ndiverged into terrestrial, arboreal, and flying species; and finally, in\r\nthe bats we have a truly aerial, and in the whales a truly aquatic order\r\nof mammals. We thus see that, beginning with different varieties of the\r\nsame species, we have allied species, genera, families, and orders, with\r\nsimilarly divergent habits, and adaptations to different modes of life,\r\nindicating some general principle in nature which has been operative in\r\nthe development of the organic world. But in order to be thus operative\r\nit must be a generally useful principle, and Mr. Darwin has very clearly\r\nshown us in what this utility consists.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Divergence leads to a Maximum of Organic Forms in each Area._\r\n\r\nDivergence of character has a double purpose and use. In the first place\r\nit enables a species which is being overcome by rivals, or is in\r\nprocess of extinction by enemies, to save itself by adopting new habits\r\nor by occupying vacant places in nature. This is the immediate and\r\nobvious effect of all the numerous examples of divergence of character\r\nwhich we have pointed out. But there is another and less obvious result,\r\nwhich is, that the greater the diversity in the organisms inhabiting a\r\ncountry or district the greater will be the total amount of life that\r\ncan be supported there. Hence the continued action of the struggle for\r\nexistence will tend to bring about more and more diversity in each area,\r\nwhich may be shown to be the case by several kinds of evidence. As an\r\nexample, a piece of turf, three feet by four in size, was found by Mr.\r\nDarwin to contain twenty species of plants, and these twenty species\r\nbelonged to eighteen genera and to eight orders, showing how greatly\r\nthey differed from each other. Farmers find that a greater quantity of\r\nhay is obtained from ground sown with a variety of genera of grasses,\r\nclover, etc., than from similar land sown with one or two species only;\r\nand the same principle applies to rotation of crops, plants differing\r\nvery widely from each other giving the best results. So, in small and\r\nuniform islands, and in small ponds of fresh water, the plants and\r\ninsects, though few in number, are found to be wonderfully varied in\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe same principle is seen in the naturalisation of plants and animals\r\nby man's agency in distant lands, for the species that thrive best and\r\nestablish themselves permanently are not only very varied among\r\nthemselves but differ greatly from the native inhabitants. Thus, in the\r\nNorthern United States there are, according to Dr. Asa Gray, 260\r\nnaturalised flowering plants which belong to no less than 162 genera;\r\nand of these, 100 genera are not natives of the United States. So, in\r\nAustralia, the rabbit, though totally unlike any native animal, has\r\nincreased so much that it probably outnumbers in individuals all the\r\nnative mammals of the country; and in New Zealand the rabbit and the pig\r\nhave equally multiplied. Darwin remarks that this \"advantage of\r\ndiversification of structure in the inhabitants of the same region is,\r\nin fact, the same as that of the physiological division of labour in the\r\norgans of the same body. No physiologist doubts that a stomach adapted\r\nto digest vegetable matter alone, or flesh alone, draws more nutriment\r\nfrom these substances. So, in the general economy of any land, the more\r\nwidely and perfectly the animals and plants are diversified for\r\ndifferent habits of life, so will a greater number of individuals be\r\ncapable of there supporting themselves.\"[39]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The most closely allied Species inhabit distinct Areas._\r\n\r\nOne of the curious results of the general action of this principle in\r\nnature is, that the most closely allied species--those whose differences\r\nthough often real and important are hardly perceptible to any one but a\r\nnaturalist--are usually not found in the same but in widely separated\r\ncountries. Thus, the nearest allies to our European golden plover are\r\nfound in North America and East Asia; the nearest ally of our European\r\njay is found in Japan, although there are several other species of jays\r\nin Western Asia and North Africa; and though we have several species of\r\ntitmice in England they are not very closely allied to each other. The\r\nform most akin to our blue tit is the azure tit of Central Asia (Parus\r\nazureus); the Parus ledouci of Algeria is very near our coal tit, and\r\nthe Parus lugubris of South-Eastern Europe and Asia Minor is nearest to\r\nour marsh tit. So, our four species of wild pigeons--the ring-dove,\r\nstock-dove, rock-pigeon, and turtle-dove--are not closely allied to each\r\nother, but each of them belongs, according to some ornithologists, to a\r\nseparate genus or subgenus, and has its nearest relatives in distant\r\nparts of Asia and Africa. In mammalia the same thing occurs. Each\r\nmountain region of Europe and Asia has usually its own species of wild\r\nsheep and goat, and sometimes of antelope and deer; so that in each\r\nregion there is found the greatest diversity in this class of animals,\r\nwhile the closest allies inhabit quite distinct and often distant areas.\r\nIn plants we find the same phenomenon prevalent. Distinct species of\r\ncolumbine are found in Central Europe (Aguilegia vulgaris), in Eastern\r\nEurope, and Siberia (A. glandulosa), in the Alps (A. Alpina), in the\r\nPyrenees (A. pyrenaiea), in the Greek mountains (A. ottonis), and in\r\nCorsica (A. Bernardi), but rarely are two species found in the same\r\narea. So, each part of the world has its own peculiar forms of pines,\r\nfirs, and cedars, but the closely allied species or varieties are in\r\nalmost every case inhabitants of distinct areas. Examples are the deodar\r\nof the Himalayas, the cedar of Lebanon, and that of North Africa, all\r\nvery closely allied but confined to distinct areas; and the numerous\r\nclosely allied species of true pine (genus Pinus), which almost always\r\ninhabit different countries or occupy different stations. We will now\r\nconsider some other modes in which natural selection will act, to adapt\r\norganisms to changed conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adaptation to Conditions at Various Periods of Life._\r\n\r\nIt is found, that, in domestic animals and cultivated plants, variations\r\noccurring at any one period of life reappear in the offspring at the\r\nsame period, and can be perpetuated and increased by selection without\r\nmodifying other parts of the organisation. Thus, variations in the\r\ncaterpillar or the cocoon of the silkworm, in the eggs of poultry, and\r\nin the seeds or young shoots of many culinary vegetables, have been\r\naccumulated till those parts have become greatly modified and, for man's\r\npurposes, improved. Owing to this fact it is easy for organisms to\r\nbecome so modified as to avoid dangers that occur at any one period of\r\nlife. Thus it is that so many seeds have become adapted to various modes\r\nof dissemination or protection. Some are winged, or have down or hairs\r\nattached to them, so as to enable them to be carried long distances in\r\nthe air; others have curious hooks and prickles, which cause them to be\r\nattached firmly to the fur of mammals or the feathers of birds; while\r\nothers are buried within sweet or juicy and brightly coloured fruits,\r\nwhich are seen and devoured by birds, the hard smooth seeds passing\r\nthrough their bodies in a fit state for germination. In the struggle for\r\nexistence it must benefit a plant to have increased means of dispersing\r\nits seeds, and of thus having young plants produced in a greater variety\r\nof soils, aspects, and surroundings, with a greater chance of some of\r\nthem escaping their numerous enemies and arriving at maturity. The\r\nvarious differences referred to would, therefore, be brought about by\r\nvariation and survival of the fittest, just as surely as the length and\r\nquality of cotton on the seed of the cotton-plant have been increased\r\nby man's selection.\r\n\r\nThe larvae of insects have thus been wonderfully modified in order to\r\nescape the numerous enemies to whose attacks they are exposed at this\r\nperiod of their existence. Their colours and markings have become\r\nmarvellously adapted to conceal them among the foliage of the plant they\r\nlive upon, and this colour often changes completely after the last\r\nmoult, when the creature has to descend to the ground for its change to\r\nthe pupa state, during which period a brown instead of a green colour is\r\nprotective. Others have acquired curious attitudes and large ocelli,\r\nwhich cause them to resemble the head of some reptile, or they have\r\ncurious horns or coloured ejectile processes which frighten away\r\nenemies; while a great number have acquired secretions which render them\r\noffensive to the taste of their enemies, and these are always adorned\r\nwith very conspicuous markings or brilliant colours, which serve as a\r\nsign of inedibility and prevent their being needlessly attacked. This,\r\nhowever, is a portion of the very large subject of organic colour and\r\nmarking, which will be fully discussed and illustrated in a separate\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nIn this way every possible modification of an animal or plant, whether\r\nin colour, form, structure, or habits, which would be serviceable to it\r\nor to its progeny at any period of its existence, may be readily brought\r\nabout. There are some curious organs which are used only once in a\r\ncreature's life, but which are yet essential to its existence, and thus\r\nhave very much the appearance of design by an intelligent designer. Such\r\nare, the great jaws possessed by some insects, used exclusively for\r\nopening the cocoon, and the hard tip to the beak of unhatched birds used\r\nfor breaking the eggshell. The increase in thickness or hardness of the\r\ncocoons or the eggs being useful for protection against enemies or to\r\navoid accidents, it is probable that the change has been very gradual,\r\nbecause it would be constantly checked by the necessity for a\r\ncorresponding change in the young insects or birds enabling them to\r\novercome the additional obstacle of a tougher cocoon or a harder\r\neggshell. As we have seen, however, that every part of the organism\r\nappears to be varying independently, at the same time, though to\r\ndifferent amounts, there seems no reason to believe that the necessity\r\nfor two or more coincident variations would prevent the required change\r\nfrom taking place.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Continued Existence of Low Forms of Life._\r\n\r\nSince species are continually undergoing modifications giving them some\r\nsuperiority over other species or enabling them to occupy fresh places\r\nin nature, it may be asked--Why do any low forms continue to exist? Why\r\nhave they not long since been improved and developed into higher forms?\r\nThe answer, probably, is, that these low forms occupy places in nature\r\nwhich cannot be filled by higher forms, and that they have few or no\r\ncompetitors; they therefore continue to exist. Thus, earthworms are\r\nadapted to their mode of life better than they would be if more highly\r\norganised. So, in the ocean, the minute foraminifera and infusoria, and\r\nthe larger sponges and corals, occupy places which more highly developed\r\ncreatures could not fill. They form, as it were, the base of the great\r\nstructure of animal life, on which the next higher forms rest; and\r\nthough in the course of ages they may undergo some changes, and\r\ndiversification of form and structure, in accordance with changed\r\nconditions, their essential nature has probably remained the same from\r\nthe very dawn of life on the earth. The low aquatic diatomaceae and\r\nconfervae, together with the lowest fungi and lichens, occupy a similar\r\nposition in the vegetable kingdom, filling places in nature which would\r\nbe left vacant if only highly organised plants existed. There is,\r\ntherefore, no motive power to destroy or seriously to modify them; and\r\nthey have thus probably persisted, under slightly varying forms, through\r\nall geological time.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extinction of Lower Types among the Higher Animals._\r\n\r\nSo soon; however, as we approach the higher and more fully developed\r\ngroups, we see indications of the often repeated extinction of lower by\r\nhigher forms. This is shown by the great gaps that separate the\r\nmammalia, birds, reptiles, and fishes from each other; while the lowest\r\nforms of each are always few in number and confined to limited areas.\r\nSuch are the lowest mammals--the echidna and ornithorhynchus of\r\nAustralia; the lowest birds--the apteryx of New Zealand and the\r\ncassowaries of the New Guinea region; while the lowest fish--the\r\namphioxus or lancelet, is completely isolated, and has apparently\r\nsurvived only by its habit of burrowing in the sand. The great\r\ndistinctness of the carnivora, ruminants, rodents, whales, bats, and\r\nother orders of mammalia; of the accipitres, pigeons, and parrots, among\r\nbirds; and of the beetles, bees, flies, and moths, among insects, all\r\nindicate an enormous amount of extinction among the comparatively low\r\nforms by which, on any theory of evolution, these higher and more\r\nspecialised groups must have been preceded.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Circumstances favourable to the Origin of New Species by Natural\r\nSelection._\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that, when there is no change in the physical or\r\norganic conditions of a country, the effect of natural selection is to\r\nkeep all the species inhabiting it in a state of perfect health and full\r\ndevelopment, and to preserve the balance that already exists between the\r\ndifferent groups of organisms. But, whenever the physical or organic\r\nconditions change, to however small an extent, some corresponding change\r\nwill be produced in the flora and fauna, since, considering the severe\r\nstruggle for existence and the complex relations of the various\r\norganisms, it is hardly possible that the change should not be\r\nbeneficial to some species and hurtful to others. The most common\r\neffect, therefore, will be that some species will increase and others\r\nwill diminish; and in cases where a species was already small in numbers\r\na further diminution might lead to extinction. This would afford room\r\nfor the increase of other species, and thus a considerable readjustment\r\nof the proportions of the several species might take place. When,\r\nhowever, the change was of a more important character, directly\r\naffecting the existence of many species so as to render it difficult for\r\nthem to maintain themselves without some considerable change in\r\nstructure or habits, that change would, in some cases, be brought about\r\nby variation and natural selection, and thus new varieties or new\r\nspecies might be formed. We have to consider, then, which are the\r\nspecies that would be most likely to be so modified, while others, not\r\nbecoming modified, would succumb to the changed conditions and become\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\nThe most important condition of all is, undoubtedly, that variations\r\nshould occur of sufficient amount, of a sufficiently diverse character,\r\nand in a large number of individuals, so as to afford ample materials\r\nfor natural selection to act upon; and this, we have seen, does occur in\r\nmost, if not in all, large, wide-ranging, and dominant species. From\r\nsome of these, therefore, the new species adapted to the changed\r\nconditions would usually be derived; and this would especially be the\r\ncase when the change of conditions was rather rapid, and when a\r\ncorrespondingly rapid modification could alone save some species from\r\nextinction. But when the change was very gradual, then even less\r\nabundant and less widely distributed species might become modified into\r\nnew forms, more especially if the extinction of many of the rarer\r\nspecies left vacant places in the economy of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Probable Origin of the Dippers._\r\n\r\nAn excellent example of how a limited group of species has been able to\r\nmaintain itself by adaptation to one of these \"vacant places\" in nature,\r\nis afforded by the curious little birds called dippers or water-ouzels,\r\nforming the genus Cinclus and the family Cinclidae of naturalists. These\r\nbirds are something like small thrushes, with very short wings and tail,\r\nand very dense plumage. They frequent, exclusively, mountain torrents in\r\nthe northern hemisphere, and obtain their food entirely in the water,\r\nconsisting, as it does, of water-beetles, caddis-worms and other\r\ninsect-larvae, as well as numerous small freshwater shells. These birds,\r\nalthough not far removed in structure from thrushes and wrens, have the\r\nextraordinary power of flying under water; for such, according to the\r\nbest observers, is their process of diving in search of their prey,\r\ntheir dense and somewhat fibrous plumage retaining so much air that the\r\nwater is prevented from touching their bodies or even from wetting their\r\nfeathers to any great extent. Their powerful feet and long curved claws\r\nenable them to hold on to stones at the bottom, and thus to retain their\r\nposition while picking up insects, shells, etc. As they frequent\r\nchiefly the most rapid and boisterous torrents, among rocks, waterfalls,\r\nand huge boulders, the water is never frozen over, and they are thus\r\nable to live during the severest winters. Only a very few species of\r\ndipper are known, all those of the old world being so closely allied to\r\nour British bird that some ornithologists consider them to be merely\r\nlocal races of one species; while in North America and the northern\r\nAndes there are two other species.\r\n\r\nHere then we have a bird, which, in its whole structure, shows a close\r\naffinity to the smaller typical perching birds, but which has departed\r\nfrom all its allies in its habits and mode of life, and has secured for\r\nitself a place in nature where it has few competitors and few enemies.\r\nWe may well suppose, that, at some remote period, a bird which was\r\nperhaps the common and more generalised ancestor of most of our\r\nthrushes, warblers, wrens, etc., had spread widely over the great\r\nnorthern continent, and had given rise to numerous varieties adapted to\r\nspecial conditions of life. Among these some took to feeding on the\r\nborders of clear streams, picking out such larvae and molluscs as they\r\ncould reach in shallow water. When food became scarce they would attempt\r\nto pick them out of deeper and deeper water, and while doing this in\r\ncold weather many would become frozen and starved. But any which\r\npossessed denser and more hairy plumage than usual, which was able to\r\nkeep out the water, would survive; and thus a race would be formed which\r\nwould depend more and more on this kind of food. Then, following up the\r\nfrozen streams into the mountains, they would be able to live there\r\nduring the winter; and as such places afforded them much protection from\r\nenemies and ample shelter for their nests and young, further adaptations\r\nwould occur, till the wonderful power of diving and flying under water\r\nwas acquired by a true land-bird.\r\n\r\nThat such habits might be acquired under stress of need is rendered\r\nhighly probable by the facts stated by the well-known American\r\nnaturalist, Dr. Abbott. He says that \"the water-thrushes (Seiurus sp.)\r\nall wade in water, and often, seeing minute mollusca on the bottom of\r\nthe stream, plunge both head and neck beneath the surface, so that\r\noften, for several seconds, a large part of the body is submerged. Now\r\nthese birds still have the plumage pervious to water, and so are liable\r\nto be drenched and sodden; but they have also the faculty of giving\r\nthese drenched feathers such a good shaking that flight is practicable a\r\nmoment after leaving the water. Certainly the water-thrushes (Seiurus\r\nludovicianus, S. auricapillus, and S. noveboracensis) have taken many\r\npreliminary steps to becoming as aquatic as the dipper; and the\r\nwinter-wren, and even the Maryland yellow-throat are not far\r\nbehind.\"[40]\r\n\r\nAnother curious example of the way in which species have been modified\r\nto occupy new places in nature, is afforded by the various animals which\r\ninhabit the water-vessels formed by the leaves of many epiphytal species\r\nof Bromelia. Fritz Müller has described a caddis-fly larva which lives\r\namong these leaves, and which has been modified in the pupa state in\r\naccordance with its surroundings. The pupae of caddis-flies inhabiting\r\nstreams have fringes of hair on the tarsi to enable them to reach the\r\nsurface on leaving their cases. But in the species inhabiting bromelia\r\nleaves there is no need for swimming, and accordingly we find the tarsi\r\nentirely bare. In the same plants are found curious little Entomostraca,\r\nvery abundant there but found nowhere else. These form a new genus, but\r\nare most nearly allied to Cythere, a marine type. It is believed that\r\nthe transmission of this species from one tree to another must be\r\neffected by the young crustacea, which are very minute, clinging to\r\nbeetles, many of which, both terrestrial and aquatic, also inhabit the\r\nbromelia leaves; and as some water-beetles are known to frequent the\r\nsea, it is perhaps by these means that the first emigrants established\r\nthemselves in this strange new abode. Bromeliae are often very abundant\r\non trees growing on the water's edge, and this would facilitate the\r\ntransition from a marine to an arboreal habitat. Fritz Müller has also\r\nfound, among the bromelia leaves, a small frog bearing its eggs on its\r\nback, and having some other peculiarities of structure. Several\r\nbeautiful little aquatic plants of the genus Utricularia or bladder-wort\r\nalso inhabit bromelia leaves; and these send runners out to neighbouring\r\nplants and thus spread themselves with great rapidity.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Importance of Isolation._\r\n\r\nIsolation is no doubt an important aid to natural selection, as shown by\r\nthe fact that islands so often present a number of peculiar species; and\r\nthe same thing is seen on the two sides of a great mountain range or on\r\nopposite coasts of a continent. The importance of isolation is twofold.\r\nIn the first place, it leads to a body of individuals of each species\r\nbeing limited in their range and thus subjected to uniform conditions\r\nfor long spaces of time. Both the direct action of the environment and\r\nthe natural selection of such varieties only as are suited to the\r\nconditions, will, therefore, be able to produce their full effect. In\r\nthe second place, the process of change will not be interfered with by\r\nintercrossing with other individuals which are becoming adapted to\r\nsomewhat different conditions in an adjacent area. But this question of\r\nthe swamping effects of intercrossing will be considered in another\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin was of opinion that, on the whole, the largeness of the area\r\noccupied by a species was of more importance than isolation, as a factor\r\nin the production of new species, and in this I quite agree with him. It\r\nmust, too, be remembered, that isolation will often be produced in a\r\ncontinuous area whenever a species becomes modified in accordance with\r\nvaried conditions or diverging habits. For example, a wide-ranging\r\nspecies may in the northern and colder part of its area become modified\r\nin one direction, and in the southern part in another direction; and\r\nthough for a long time an intermediate form may continue to exist in the\r\nintervening area, this will be likely soon to die out, both because its\r\nnumbers will be small, and it will be more or less pressed upon in\r\nvarying seasons by the modified varieties, each better able to endure\r\nextremes of climate. So, when one portion of a terrestrial species takes\r\nto a more arboreal or to a more aquatic mode of life, the change of\r\nhabit itself leads to the isolation of each portion. Again, as will be\r\nmore fully explained in a future chapter, any difference of habits or of\r\nhaunts usually leads to some modification of colour or marking, as a\r\nmeans of concealment from enemies; and there is reason to believe that\r\nthis difference will be intensified by natural selection as a means of\r\nidentification and recognition by members of the same variety or\r\nincipient species. It has also been observed that each differently\r\ncoloured variety of wild animals, or of domesticated animals which have\r\nrun wild, keep together, and refuse to pair with individuals of the\r\nother colours; and this must of itself act to keep the races separate as\r\ncompletely as physical isolation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the Advance of Organisation by Natural Selection._\r\n\r\nAs natural selection acts solely by the preservation of useful\r\nvariations, or those which are beneficial to the organism under the\r\nconditions to which it is exposed, the result must necessarily be that\r\neach species or group tends to become more and more improved in relation\r\nto its conditions. Hence we should expect that the larger groups in each\r\nclass of animals and plants--those which have persisted and have been\r\nabundant throughout geological ages--would, almost necessarily, have\r\narrived at a high degree of organisation, both physical and mental.\r\nIllustrations of this are to be seen everywhere. Among mammalia we have\r\nthe carnivora, which from Eocene times have been becoming more and more\r\nspecialised, till they have culminated in the cat and dog tribes, which\r\nhave reached a degree of perfection both in structure and intelligence\r\nfully equal to that of any other animals. In another line of\r\ndevelopment, the herbivora have been specialised for living solely on\r\nvegetable food till they have culminated in the sheep, the cattle, the\r\ndeer, and the antelopes. The horse tribe, commencing with an early\r\nfour-toed ancestor in the Eocene age, has increased in size and in\r\nperfect adaptation of feet and teeth to a life on open plains, and has\r\nreached its highest perfection in the horse, the ass, and the zebra. In\r\nbirds, also, we see an advance from the imperfect tooth-billed and\r\nreptile-tailed birds of the secondary epoch, to the wonderfully\r\ndeveloped falcons, crows, and swallows of our time. So, the ferns,\r\nlycopods, conifers, and monocotyledons of the palaeozoic and mesozoic\r\nrocks, have developed into the marvellous wealth of forms of the higher\r\ndicotyledons that now adorn the earth.\r\n\r\nBut this remarkable advance in the higher and larger groups does not\r\nimply any universal law of progress in organisation, because we have at\r\nthe same time numerous examples (as has been already pointed out) of the\r\npersistence of lowly organised forms, and also of absolute degradation\r\nor degeneration. Serpents, for example, have been developed from some\r\nlizard-like type which has lost its limbs; and though this loss has\r\nenabled them to occupy fresh places in nature and to increase and\r\nflourish to a marvellous extent, yet it must be considered to be a\r\nretrogression rather than an advance in organisation. The same remark\r\nwill apply to the whale tribe among mammals; to the blind amphibia and\r\ninsects of the great caverns; and among plants to the numerous cases in\r\nwhich flowers, once specially adapted to be fertilised by insects, have\r\nlost their gay corollas and their special adaptations, and have become\r\ndegraded into wind-fertilised forms. Such are our plantains, our meadow\r\nburnet, and even, as some botanists maintain, our rushes, sedges, and\r\ngrasses. The causes which have led to this degeneration will be\r\ndiscussed in a future chapter; but the facts are undisputed, and they\r\nshow us that although variation and the struggle for existence may lead,\r\non the whole, to a continued advance of organisation; yet they also lead\r\nin many cases to a retrogression, when such retrogression may aid in the\r\npreservation of any form under new conditions. They also lead to the\r\npersistence, with slight modifications, of numerous lowly organised\r\nforms which are suited to places which higher forms could not fully\r\noccupy, or to conditions under which they could not exist. Such are the\r\nocean depths, the soil of the earth, the mud of rivers, deep caverns,\r\nsubterranean waters, etc.; and it is in such places as these, as well as\r\nin some oceanic islands which competing higher forms have not been able\r\nto reach, that we find many curious relics of an earlier world, which,\r\nin the free air and sunlight and in the great continents, have long\r\nsince been driven out or exterminated by higher types.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Summary of the first Five Chapters._\r\n\r\nWe have now passed in review, in more or less detail, the main facts on\r\nwhich the theory of \"the origin of species by means of natural\r\nselection\" is founded. In future chapters we shall have to deal mainly\r\nwith the application of the theory to explain the varied and complex\r\nphenomena presented by the organic world; and, also, to discuss some of\r\nthe theories put forth by modern writers, either as being more\r\nfundamental than that of Darwin or as supplementary to it. Before doing\r\nthis, however, it will be well briefly to summarise the facts and\r\narguments already set forth, because it is only by a clear comprehension\r\nof these that the full importance of the theory can be appreciated and\r\nits further applications understood.\r\n\r\nThe theory itself is exceedingly simple, and the facts on which it\r\nrests--though excessively numerous individually, and coextensive with\r\nthe entire organic world--yet come under a few simple and easily\r\nunderstood classes. These facts are,--first, the enormous powers of\r\nincrease in geometrical progression possessed by all organisms, and the\r\ninevitable struggle for existence among them; and, in the second place,\r\nthe occurrence of much individual variation combined with the hereditary\r\ntransmission of such variations. From these two great classes of facts,\r\nwhich are universal and indisputable, there necessarily arises, as\r\nDarwin termed it, the \"preservation of favoured races in the struggle\r\nfor life,\" the continuous action of which, under the ever-changing\r\nconditions both of the inorganic and organic universe, necessarily leads\r\nto the formation or development of new species.\r\n\r\nBut, although this general statement is complete and indisputable, yet\r\nto see its applications under all the complex conditions that actually\r\noccur in nature, it is necessary always to bear in mind the tremendous\r\npower and universality of the agencies at work. We must never for an\r\ninstant lose sight of the fact of the enormously rapid increase of all\r\norganisms, which has been illustrated by actual cases, given in our\r\nsecond chapter, no less than by calculations of the results of unchecked\r\nincrease for a few years. Then, never forgetting that the animal and\r\nplant population of any country is, on the whole, stationary, we must be\r\nalways trying to realise the ever-recurring destruction of the enormous\r\nannual increase, and asking ourselves what determines, in each\r\nindividual case, the death of the many, the survival of the few. We must\r\nthink over all the causes of destruction to each organism,--to the seed,\r\nthe young shoot, the growing plant, the full-grown tree, or shrub, or\r\nherb, and again the fruit and seed; and among animals, to the egg or\r\nnew-born young, to the youthful, and to the adults. Then, we must always\r\nbear in mind that what goes on in the case of the individual or family\r\ngroup we may observe or think of, goes on also among the millions and\r\nscores of millions of individuals which are comprised in almost every\r\nspecies; and must get rid of the idea that _chance_ determines which\r\nshall live and which die. For, although in many individual cases death\r\nmay be due to chance rather than to any inferiority in those which die\r\nfirst, yet we cannot possibly believe that this can be the case on the\r\nlarge scale on which nature works. A plant, for instance, cannot be\r\nincreased unless there are suitable vacant places its seeds can grow in,\r\nor stations where it can overcome other less vigorous and healthy\r\nplants. The seeds of all plants, by their varied modes of dispersal, may\r\nbe said to be seeking out such places in which to grow; and we cannot\r\ndoubt that, in the long run, those individuals whose seeds are the most\r\nnumerous, have the greatest powers of dispersal, and the greatest vigour\r\nof growth, will leave more descendants than the individuals of the same\r\nspecies which are inferior in all these respects, although now and then\r\nsome seed of an inferior individual may _chance_ to be carried to a spot\r\nwhere it can grow and survive. The same rule will apply to every period\r\nof life and to every danger to which plants or animals are exposed. The\r\nbest organised, or the most healthy, or the most active, or the best\r\nprotected, or the most intelligent, will inevitably, in the long run,\r\ngain an advantage over those which are inferior in these qualities; that\r\nis, _the fittest will survive_, the fittest being, in each particular\r\ncase, those which are superior in the special qualities on which safety\r\ndepends. At one period of life, or to escape one kind of danger,\r\nconcealment may be necessary; at another time, to escape another danger,\r\nswiftness; at another, intelligence or cunning; at another, the power to\r\nendure rain or cold or hunger; and those which possess all these\r\nfaculties in the fullest perfection will generally survive.\r\n\r\nHaving fully grasped these facts in all their fulness and in their\r\nendless and complex results, we have next to consider the phenomena of\r\nvariation, discussed in the third and fourth chapters; and it is here\r\nthat perhaps the greatest difficulty will be felt in appreciating the\r\nfull importance of the evidence as set forth. It has been so generally\r\nthe practice to speak of variation as something exceptional and\r\ncomparatively rare--as an abnormal deviation from the uniformity and\r\nstability of the characters of a species--and so few even among\r\nnaturalists have ever compared, accurately, considerable numbers of\r\nindividuals, that the conception of variability as a general\r\ncharacteristic of all dominant and widespread species, large in its\r\namount and affecting, not a few, but considerable masses of the\r\nindividuals which make up the species, will be to many entirely new.\r\nEqually important is the fact that the variability extends to every\r\norgan and every structure, external and internal; while perhaps most\r\nimportant of all is the independent variability of these several parts,\r\neach one varying without any constant or even usual dependence on, or\r\ncorrelation with, other parts. No doubt there is some such correlation\r\nin the differences that exist between species and species--more\r\ndeveloped wings usually accompanying smaller feet and _vice versâ_--but\r\nthis is, generally, a useful adaptation which has been brought about by\r\nnatural selection, and does not apply to the individual variability\r\nwhich occurs within the species.\r\n\r\nIt is because these facts of variation are so important and so little\r\nunderstood, that they have been discussed in what will seem to some\r\nreaders wearisome and unnecessary detail. Many naturalists, however,\r\nwill hold that even more evidence is required; and more, to almost any\r\namount, could easily have been given. The character and variety of that\r\nalready adduced will, however, I trust, convince most readers that the\r\nfacts are as stated; while they have been drawn from a sufficiently wide\r\narea to indicate a general principle throughout nature.\r\n\r\nIf, now, we fully realise these facts of variation, along with those of\r\nrapid multiplication and the struggle for existence, most of the\r\ndifficulties in the way of comprehending how species have originated\r\nthrough natural selection will disappear. For whenever, through changes\r\nof climate, or of altitude, or of the nature of the soil, or of the area\r\nof the country, any species are exposed to new dangers, and have to\r\nmaintain themselves and provide for the safety of their offspring under\r\nnew and more arduous conditions, then, in the variability of all parts,\r\norgans, and structures, no less than of habits and intelligence, we have\r\nthe means of producing modifications which will certainly bring the\r\nspecies into harmony with its new conditions. And if we remember that\r\nall such physical changes are slow and gradual in their operation, we\r\nshall see that the amount of variation which we know occurs in every new\r\ngeneration will be quite sufficient to enable modification and\r\nadaptation to go on at the same rate. Mr. Darwin was rather inclined to\r\nexaggerate the necessary slowness of the action of natural selection;\r\nbut with the knowledge we now possess of the great amount and range of\r\nindividual variation, there seems no difficulty in an amount of change,\r\nquite equivalent to that which usually distinguishes allied species,\r\nsometimes taking place in less than a century, should any rapid change\r\nof conditions necessitate an equally rapid adaptation. This may often\r\nhave occurred, either to immigrants into a new land, or to residents\r\nwhose country has been cut off by subsidence from a larger and more\r\nvaried area over which they had formerly roamed. When no change of\r\nconditions occurs, species may remain unchanged for very long periods,\r\nand thus produce that appearance of stability of species which is even\r\nnow often adduced as an argument against evolution by natural selection,\r\nbut which is really quite in harmony with it.\r\n\r\nOn the principles, and by the light of the facts, now briefly\r\nsummarised, we have been able, in the present chapter, to indicate how\r\nnatural selection acts, how divergence of character is set up, how\r\nadaptation to conditions at various periods of life has been effected,\r\nhow it is that low forms of life continue to exist, what kind of\r\ncircumstances are most favourable to the formation of new species, and,\r\nlastly, to what extent the advance of organisation to higher types is\r\nproduced by natural selection. We will now pass on to consider some of\r\nthe more important objections and difficulties which have been advanced\r\nby eminent naturalists.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: _Origin of Species_, p. 71.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: Yarrell's _British Birds_, fourth edition, vol. iii. p.\r\n77.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: _Origin of Species_, p. 89.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: _Nature_, vol. xxx. p. 30.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nDIFFICULTIES AND OBJECTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n    Difficulty as to smallness of variations--As to the right\r\n    variations occurring when required--The beginnings of important\r\n    organs--The mammary glands--The eyes of flatfish--Origin of the\r\n    eye--Useless or non-adaptive characters--Recent extension of the\r\n    region of utility in plants--The same in animals--Uses of\r\n    tails--Of the horns of deer--Of the scale-ornamentation of\r\n    reptiles--Instability of non-adaptive characters--Delboeuf's\r\n    law--No \"specific\" character proved to be useless--The swamping\r\n    effects of intercrossing--Isolation as preventing\r\n    intercrossing--Gulick on the effects of isolation--Cases in\r\n    which isolation is ineffective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the present chapter I propose to discuss the more obvious and often\r\nrepeated objections to Darwin's theory, and to show how far they affect\r\nits character as a true and sufficient explanation of the origin of\r\nspecies. The more recondite difficulties, affecting such fundamental\r\nquestions as the causes and laws of variability, will be left for a\r\nfuture chapter, after we have become better acquainted with the\r\napplications of the theory to the more important adaptations and\r\ncorrelations of animal and plant life.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest and most often repeated objections was, that it was\r\ndifficult \"to imagine a reason why variations tending in an\r\ninfinitesimal degree in any special direction should be preserved,\" or\r\nto believe that the complex adaptation of living organisms could have\r\nbeen produced \"by infinitesimal beginnings.\" Now this term\r\n\"infinitesimal,\" used by a well-known early critic of the _Origin of\r\nSpecies_, was never made use of by Darwin himself, who spoke only of\r\nvariations being \"slight,\" and of the \"small amount\" of the variations\r\nthat might be selected. Even in using these terms he undoubtedly\r\nafforded grounds for the objection above made, that such small and\r\nslight variations could be of no real use, and would not determine the\r\nsurvival of the individuals possessing them. We have seen, however, in\r\nour third chapter, that even Darwin's terms were hardly justified; and\r\nthat the variability of many important species is of considerable\r\namount, and may very often be properly described as large. As this is\r\nfound to be the case both in animals and plants, and in all their chief\r\ngroups and subdivisions, and also to apply to all the separate parts and\r\norgans that have been compared, we must take it as proved that the\r\naverage _amount_ of variability presents no difficulty whatever in the\r\nway of the action of natural selection. It may be here mentioned that,\r\nup to the time of the preparation of the last edition of _The Origin of\r\nSpecies_, Darwin had not seen the work of Mr. J.A. Allen of Harvard\r\nUniversity (then only just published), which gave us the first body of\r\naccurate comparisons and measurements demonstrating this large amount of\r\nvariability. Since then evidence of this nature has been accumulating,\r\nand we are, therefore, now in a far better position to appreciate the\r\nfacilities for natural selection, in this respect, than was Mr. Darwin\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nAnother objection of a similar nature is, that the chances are immensely\r\nagainst the right variation or combination of variations occurring just\r\nwhen required; and further, that no variation can be perpetuated that is\r\nnot accompanied by several concomitant variations of dependent\r\nparts--greater length of a wing in a bird, for example, would be of\r\nlittle use if unaccompanied by increased volume or contractility of the\r\nmuscles which move it. This objection seemed a very strong one so long\r\nas it was supposed that variations occurred singly and at considerable\r\nintervals; but it ceases to have any weight now we know that they occur\r\nsimultaneously in various parts of the organism, and also in a large\r\nproportion of the individuals which make up the species. A considerable\r\nnumber of individuals will, therefore, every year possess the required\r\ncombination of characters; and it may also be considered probable that\r\nwhen the two characters are such that they always _act_ together, there\r\nwill be such a correlation between them that they will frequently _vary_\r\ntogether. But there is another consideration that seems to show that\r\nthis coincident variation is not essential. All animals in a state of\r\nnature are kept, by the constant struggle for existence and the survival\r\nof the fittest, in such a state of perfect health and usually\r\nsuperabundant vigour, that in all ordinary circumstances they possess a\r\nsurplus power in every important organ--a surplus only drawn upon in\r\ncases of the direst necessity when their very existence is at stake. It\r\nfollows, therefore, that _any_ additional power given to one of the\r\ncomponent parts of an organ must be useful--an increase, for example,\r\neither in the wing muscles or in the form or length of the wing might\r\ngive _some_ increased powers of flight; and thus alternate\r\nvariations--in one generation in the muscles, in another generation in\r\nthe wing itself--might be as effective in permanently improving the\r\npowers of flight as coincident variations at longer intervals. On either\r\nsupposition, however, this objection appears to have little weight if we\r\ntake into consideration the large amount of coincident variability that\r\nhas been shown to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Beginnings of Important Organs._\r\n\r\nWe now come to an objection which has perhaps been more frequently urged\r\nthan any other, and which Darwin himself felt to have much weight--the\r\nfirst beginnings of important organs, such, for example, as wings, eyes,\r\nmammary glands, and numerous other structures. It is urged, that it is\r\nalmost impossible to conceive how the first rudiments of these could\r\nhave been of any use, and, if not of use they could not have been\r\npreserved and further developed by natural selection.\r\n\r\nNow, the first remark to be made on objections of this nature is, that\r\nthey are really outside the question of the origin of all existing\r\nspecies from allied species not very far removed from them, which is all\r\nthat Darwin undertook to _prove_ by means of his theory. Organs and\r\nstructures such as those above mentioned all date back to a very remote\r\npast, when the world and its inhabitants were both very different from\r\nwhat they are now. To ask of a new theory that it shall reveal to us\r\nexactly what took place in remote geological epochs, and how it took\r\nplace, is unreasonable. The most that should be asked is, that some\r\nprobable or possible mode of origination should be pointed out in some\r\nat least of these difficult cases, and this Mr. Darwin has done. One or\r\ntwo of these may be briefly given here, but the whole series should be\r\ncarefully read by any one who wishes to see how many curious facts and\r\nobservations have been required in order to elucidate them; whence we\r\nmay conclude that further knowledge will probably throw light on any\r\ndifficulties that still remain.[41]\r\n\r\nIn the case of the mammary glands Mr. Darwin remarks that it is admitted\r\nthat the ancestral mammals were allied to the marsupials. Now in the\r\nvery earliest mammals, almost before they really deserved that name, the\r\nyoung may have been nourished by a fluid secreted by the interior\r\nsurface of the marsupial sack, as is believed to be the case with the\r\nfish (Hippocampus) whose eggs are hatched within a somewhat similar\r\nsack. This being the case, those individuals which secreted a more\r\nnutritious fluid, and those whose young were able to obtain and swallow\r\na more constant supply by suction, would be more likely to live and come\r\nto a healthy maturity, and would therefore be preserved by natural\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nIn another case which has been adduced as one of special difficulty, a\r\nmore complete explanation is given. Soles, turbots, and other flatfish\r\nare, as is well known, unsymmetrical. They live and move on their sides,\r\nthe under side being usually differently coloured from that which is\r\nkept uppermost. Now the eyes of these fish are curiously distorted in\r\norder that both eyes may be on the upper side, where alone they would be\r\nof any use. It was objected by Mr. Mivart that a sudden transformation\r\nof the eye from one side to the other was inconceivable, while, if the\r\ntransit were gradual the first step could be of no use, since this would\r\nnot remove the eye from the lower side. But, as Mr. Darwin shows by\r\nreference to the researches of Malm and others, the young of these fish\r\nare quite symmetrical, and during their growth exhibit to us the whole\r\nprocess of change. This begins by the fish (owing to the increasing\r\ndepth of the body) being unable to maintain the vertical position, so\r\nthat it falls on one side. It then twists the lower eye as much as\r\npossible towards the upper side; and, the whole bony structure of the\r\nhead being at this time soft and flexible, the constant repetition of\r\nthis effort causes the eye gradually to move round the head till it\r\ncomes to the upper side. Now if we suppose this process, which in the\r\nyoung is completed in a few days or weeks, to have been spread over\r\nthousands of generations during the development of these fish, those\r\nusually surviving whose eyes retained more and more of the position into\r\nwhich the young fish tried to twist them, the change becomes\r\nintelligible; though it still remains one of the most extraordinary\r\ncases of degeneration, by which symmetry--which is so universal a\r\ncharacteristic of the higher animals--is lost, in order that the\r\ncreature may be adapted to a new mode of life, whereby it is enabled the\r\nbetter to escape danger and continue its existence.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult case of all, that of the eye--the thought of which\r\neven to the last, Mr. Darwin says, \"gave him a cold shiver\"--is\r\nnevertheless shown to be not unintelligible; granting of course the\r\nsensitiveness to light of some forms of nervous tissue. For he shows\r\nthat there are, in several of the lower animals, rudiments of eyes,\r\nconsisting merely of pigment cells covered with a translucent skin,\r\nwhich may possibly serve to distinguish light from darkness, but nothing\r\nmore. Then we have an optic nerve and pigment cells; then we find a\r\nhollow filled with gelatinous substance of a convex form--the first\r\nrudiment of a lens. Many of the succeeding steps are lost, as would\r\nnecessarily be the case, owing to the great advantage of each\r\nmodification which gave increased distinctness of vision, the creatures\r\npossessing it inevitably surviving, while those below them became\r\nextinct. But we can well understand how, after the first step was taken,\r\nevery variation tending to more complete vision would be preserved till\r\nwe reached the perfect eye of birds and mammals. Even this, as we know,\r\nis not absolutely, but only relatively, perfect. Neither the chromatic\r\nnor the spherical aberration is absolutely corrected; while long-and\r\nshort-sightedness, and the various diseases and imperfections to which\r\nthe eye is liable, may be looked upon as relics of the imperfect\r\ncondition from which the eye has been raised by variation and natural\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nThese few examples of difficulties as to the origin of remarkable or\r\ncomplex organs must suffice here; but the reader who wishes further\r\ninformation on the matter may study carefully the whole of the sixth\r\nand seventh chapters of the last edition of _The Origin of Species_, in\r\nwhich these and many other cases are discussed in considerable detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Useless or non-adaptive Characters._\r\n\r\nMany naturalists seem to be of opinion that a considerable number of the\r\ncharacters which distinguish species are of no service whatever to their\r\npossessors, and therefore cannot have been produced or increased by\r\nnatural selection. Professors Bronn and Broca have urged this objection\r\non the continent. In America, Dr. Cope, the well-known palaeontologist,\r\nhas long since put forth the same objection, declaring that non-adaptive\r\ncharacters are as numerous as those which are adaptive; but he differs\r\ncompletely from most who hold the same general opinion in considering\r\nthat they occur chiefly \"in the characters of the classes, orders,\r\nfamilies, and other higher groups;\" and the objection, therefore, is\r\nquite distinct from that in which it is urged that \"specific characters\"\r\nare mostly useless. More recently, Professor G.J. Romanes has urged this\r\ndifficulty in his paper on \"Physiological Selection\" (_Journ. Linn.\r\nSoc._, vol. xix. pp. 338, 344). He says that the characters \"which serve\r\nto distinguish allied species are frequently, if not usually, of a kind\r\nwith which natural selection can have had nothing to do,\" being without\r\nany utilitarian significance. Again he speaks of \"the enormous number,\"\r\nand further on of \"the innumerable multitude\" of specific peculiarities\r\nwhich are useless; and he finally declares that the question needs no\r\nfurther arguing, \"because in the later editions of his works Mr. Darwin\r\nfreely acknowledges that a large proportion of specific distinctions\r\nmust be conceded to be useless to the species presenting them.\"\r\n\r\nI have looked in vain in Mr. Darwin's works to find any such\r\nacknowledgment, and I think Mr. Romanes has not sufficiently\r\ndistinguished between \"useless characters\" and \"useless specific\r\ndistinctions.\" On referring to all the passages indicated by him I find\r\nthat, in regard to specific characters, Mr. Darwin is very cautious in\r\nadmitting inutility. His most pronounced \"admissions\" on this question\r\nare the following: \"But when, from the nature of the organism and of the\r\nconditions, modifications have been induced which are unimportant for\r\nthe welfare of the species, they may be, and apparently often have been,\r\ntransmitted in nearly the same state _to numerous, otherwise modified,\r\ndescendants_\" (_Origin_, p. 175). The words I have here italicised\r\nclearly show that such characters are usually not \"specific,\" in the\r\nsense that they are such as distinguish species from each other, but are\r\nfound in numerous allied species. Again: \"Thus a large yet undefined\r\nextension may safely be given to the direct and indirect results of\r\nnatural selection; but I now admit, after reading the essay of Nägeli on\r\nplants, and the remarks by various authors with respect to animals, more\r\nespecially those recently made by Professor Broca, that in the earlier\r\neditions of my _Origin of Species_ I perhaps attributed too much to the\r\naction of natural selection or the survival of the fittest. I have\r\naltered the fifth edition of the _Origin_ so as to confine my remarks to\r\nadaptive changes of structure, _but I am convinced, from the light\r\ngained during even the last few years, that very many structures which\r\nnow appear to us useless, will hereafter be proved to be useful, and\r\nwill therefore come within the range of natural selection_. Nevertheless\r\nI did not formerly consider sufficiently the existence of structures\r\nwhich, _as far as we can at present judge_, are neither beneficial nor\r\ninjurious; and this I believe to be one of the greatest oversights as\r\nyet detected in my work.\" Now it is to be remarked that neither in these\r\npassages nor in any of the other less distinct expressions of opinion on\r\nthis question, does Darwin ever admit that \"specific characters\"--that\r\nis, the particular characters which serve to distinguish one species\r\nfrom another--are ever useless, much less that \"a large proportion of\r\nthem\" are so, as Mr. Romanes makes him \"freely acknowledge.\" On the\r\nother hand, in the passage which I have italicised he strongly expresses\r\nhis view that much of what we suppose to be useless is due to our\r\nignorance; and as I hold myself that, as regards many of the supposed\r\nuseless characters, this is the true explanation, it may be well to give\r\na brief sketch of the progress of knowledge in transferring characters\r\nfrom the one category to the other.\r\n\r\nWe have only to go back a single generation, and not even the most acute\r\nbotanist could have suggested a reasonable use, for each species of\r\nplant, of the infinitely varied forms, sizes, and colours of the\r\nflowers, the shapes and arrangement of the leaves, and the numerous\r\nother external characters of the whole plant. But since Mr. Darwin\r\nshowed that plants gained both in vigour and in fertility by being\r\ncrossed with other individuals of the same species, and that this\r\ncrossing was usually effected by insects which, in search of nectar or\r\npollen, carried the pollen from one plant to the flowers of another\r\nplant, almost every detail is found to have a purpose and a use. The\r\nshape, the size, and the colour of the petals, even the streaks and\r\nspots with which they are adorned, the position in which they stand, the\r\nmovements of the stamens and pistil at various times, especially at the\r\nperiod of, and just after, fertilisation, have been proved to be\r\nstrictly adaptive in so many cases that botanists now believe that all\r\nthe external characters of flowers either are or have been of use to the\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nIt has also been shown, by Kerner and other botanists, that another set\r\nof characteristics have relation to the prevention of ants, slugs, and\r\nother animals from reaching the flowers, because these creatures would\r\ndevour or injure them without effecting fertilisation. The spines,\r\nhairs, or sticky glands on the stem or flower-stalk, the curious hairs\r\nor processes shutting up the flower, or sometimes even the extreme\r\nsmoothness and polish of the outside of the petals so that few insects\r\ncan hang to the part, have been shown to be related to the possible\r\nintrusion of these \"unbidden guests.\"[42] And, still more recently,\r\nattempts have been made by Grant Allen and Sir John Lubbock to account\r\nfor the innumerable forms, textures, and groupings of leaves, by their\r\nrelation to the needs of the plants themselves; and there can be little\r\ndoubt that these attempts will be ultimately successful. Again, just as\r\nflowers have been adapted to secure fertilisation or\r\ncross-fertilisation, fruits have been developed to assist in the\r\ndispersal of seeds; and their forms, sizes, juices, and colours can be\r\nshown to be specially adapted to secure such dispersal by the agency of\r\nbirds and mammals; while the same end is secured in other cases by\r\ndowny seeds to be wafted through the air, or by hooked or sticky\r\nseed-vessels to be carried away, attached to skin, wool, or feathers.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have an enormous extension of the region of utility in\r\nthe vegetable kingdom, and one, moreover, which includes almost all the\r\nspecific characters of plants. For the species of plants are usually\r\ncharacterised either by differences in the form, size, and colour of the\r\nflowers, or of the fruits; or, by peculiarities in the shape, size,\r\ndentation, or arrangement of the leaves; or by peculiarities in the\r\nspines, hairs, or down with which various parts of the plant are\r\nclothed. In the case of plants it must certainly be admitted that\r\n\"specific\" characters are pre-eminently adaptive; and though there may\r\nbe some which are not so, yet all those referred to by Darwin as having\r\nbeen adduced by various botanists as useless, either pertain to genera\r\nor higher groups, or are found in some plants of a species only--that\r\nis, are individual variations not specific characters.\r\n\r\nIn the case of animals, the most recent wide extension of the sphere of\r\nutility has been in the matter of their colours and markings. It was of\r\ncourse always known that certain creatures gained protection by their\r\nresemblance to their normal surroundings, as in the case of white arctic\r\nanimals, the yellow or brown tints of those living in deserts, and the\r\ngreen hues of many birds and insects surrounded by tropical vegetation.\r\nBut of late years these cases have been greatly increased both in number\r\nand variety, especially in regard to those which closely imitate special\r\nobjects among which they live; and there are other kinds of coloration\r\nwhich long appeared to have no use. Large numbers of animals, more\r\nespecially insects, are gaudily coloured, either with vivid hues or with\r\nstriking patterns, so as to be very easily seen. Now it has been found,\r\nthat in almost all these cases the creatures possess some special\r\nquality which prevents their being attacked by the enemies of their kind\r\nwhenever the peculiarity is known; and the brilliant or conspicuous\r\ncolours or markings serve as a warning or signal flag against attack.\r\nLarge numbers of insects thus coloured are nauseous and inedible;\r\nothers, like wasps and bees, have stings; others are too hard to be\r\neaten by small birds; while snakes with poisonous fangs often have some\r\ncharacteristic either of rattle, hood, or unusual colour, which\r\nindicates that they had better be left alone.\r\n\r\nBut there is yet another form of coloration, which consists in special\r\nmarkings--bands, spots, or patches of white, or of bright colour, which\r\nvary in every species, and are often concealed when the creature is at\r\nrest but displayed when in motion,--as in the case of the bands and\r\nspots so frequent on the wings and tails of birds. Now these specific\r\nmarkings are believed, with good reason, to serve the purpose of\r\nenabling each species to be quickly recognised, even at a distance, by\r\nits fellows, especially the parents by their young and the two sexes by\r\neach other; and this recognition must often be an important factor in\r\nsecuring the safety of individuals, and therefore the wellbeing and\r\ncontinuance of the species. These interesting peculiarities will be more\r\nfully described in a future chapter, but they are briefly referred to\r\nhere in order to show that the most common of all the characters by\r\nwhich species are distinguished from each other--their colours and\r\nmarkings--can be shown to be adaptive or utilitarian in their nature.\r\n\r\nBut besides colour there are almost always some structural characters\r\nwhich distinguish species from species, and, as regards many of these\r\nalso, an adaptive character can be often discerned. In birds, for\r\ninstance, we have differences in the size or shape of the bill or the\r\nfeet, in the length of the wing or the tail, and in the proportions of\r\nthe several feathers of which these organs are composed. All these\r\ndifferences in the organs on which the very existence of birds depends,\r\nwhich determine the character of flight, facility for running or\r\nclimbing, for inhabiting chiefly the ground or trees, and the kind of\r\nfood that can be most easily obtained for themselves and their\r\noffspring, must surely be in the highest degree utilitarian; although in\r\neach individual case we, in our ignorance of the minutiae of their\r\nlife-history, may be quite unable to see the use. In mammalia specific\r\ndifferences other than colour usually consist in the length or shape of\r\nthe ears and tail, in the proportions of the limbs, or in the length and\r\nquality of the hair on different parts of the body. As regards the ears\r\nand tail, one of the objections by Professor Bronn relates to this very\r\npoint. He states that the length of these organs differ in the various\r\nspecies of hares and of mice, and he considers that this difference can\r\nbe of no service whatever to their possessors. But to this objection\r\nDarwin replies, that it has been shown by Dr. Schöbl that the ears of\r\nmice \"are supplied in an extraordinary manner with nerves, so that they\r\nno doubt serve as tactile organs.\" Hence, when we consider the life of\r\nmice, either nocturnal or seeking their food in dark and confined\r\nplaces, the length of the ears may be in each case adapted to the\r\nparticular habits and surroundings of the species. Again, the tail, in\r\nthe larger mammals, often serves the purpose of driving off flies and\r\nother insects from the body; and when we consider in how many parts of\r\nthe world flies are injurious or even fatal to large mammals, we see\r\nthat the peculiar characteristics of this organ may in each case have\r\nbeen adapted to its requirements in the particular area where the\r\nspecies was developed. The tail is also believed to have some use as a\r\nbalancing organ, which assists an animal to turn easily and rapidly,\r\nmuch as our arms are used when running; while in whole groups it is a\r\nprehensile organ, and has become modified in accordance with the habits\r\nand needs of each species. In the case of mice it is thus used by the\r\nyoung. Darwin informs us that the late Professor Henslow kept some\r\nharvest-mice in confinement, and observed that they frequently curled\r\ntheir tails round the branches of a bush placed in the cage, and thus\r\naided themselves in climbing; while Dr. Günther has actually seen a\r\nmouse suspend itself by the tail (_Origin_, p. 189).\r\n\r\nAgain, Mr. Lawson Tait has called attention to the use of the tail in\r\nthe cat, squirrel, yak, and many other animals as a means of preserving\r\nthe heat of the body during the nocturnal and the winter sleep. He says,\r\nthat in cold weather animals with long or bushy tails will be found\r\nlying curled up, with their tails carefully laid over their feet like a\r\nrug, and with their noses buried in the fur of the tail, which is thus\r\nused exactly in the same way and for the same purpose as we use\r\nrespirators.[43]\r\n\r\nAnother illustration is furnished by the horns of deer which, especially\r\nwhen very large, have been supposed to be a danger to the animal in\r\npassing rapidly through dense thickets. But Sir James Hector states,\r\nthat the wapiti, in North America, throws back its head, thus placing\r\nthe horns along the sides of the back, and is then enabled to rush\r\nthrough the thickest forest with great rapidity. The brow-antlers\r\nprotect the face and eyes, while the widely spreading horns prevent\r\ninjury to the neck or flanks. Thus an organ which was certainly\r\ndeveloped as a sexual weapon, has been so guided and modified during its\r\nincrease in size as to be of use in other ways. A similar use of the\r\nantlers of deer has been observed in India.[44]\r\n\r\nThe various classes of facts now referred to serve to show us that, in\r\nthe case of the two higher groups--mammalia and birds--almost all the\r\ncharacters by which species are distinguished from each other are, or\r\nmay be, adaptive. It is these two classes of animals which have been\r\nmost studied and whose life-histories are supposed to be most fully\r\nknown, yet even here the assertion of inutility, by an eminent\r\nnaturalist, in the case of two important organs, has been sufficiently\r\nmet by minute details either in the anatomy or in the habits of the\r\ngroups referred to. Such a fact as this, together with the extensive\r\nseries of characters already enumerated which have been of late years\r\ntransferred from the \"useless\" to the \"useful\" class, should convince\r\nus, that the assertion of \"inutility\" in the case of any organ or\r\npeculiarity which is not a rudiment or a correlation, is not, and can\r\nnever be, the statement of a fact, but merely an expression of our\r\nignorance of its purpose or origin.[45]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Instability of Non-adaptive Characters._\r\n\r\nOne very weighty objection to the theory that _specific_ characters can\r\never be wholly useless (or wholly unconnected with useful organs by\r\ncorrelation of growth) appears to have been overlooked by those who have\r\nmaintained the frequency of such characters, and that is, their almost\r\nnecessary instability. Darwin has remarked on the extreme variability of\r\nsecondary sexual characters--such as the horns, crests, plumes, etc.,\r\nwhich are found in males only,--the reason being, that, although of some\r\nuse, they are not of such direct and vital importance as those adaptive\r\ncharacters on which the wellbeing and very existence of the animals\r\ndepend. But in the case of wholly useless structures, which are not\r\nrudiments of once useful organs, we cannot see what there is to ensure\r\nany amount of constancy or stability. One of the cases on which Mr.\r\nRomanes lays great stress in his paper on \"Physiological Selection\"\r\n(_Journ. Linn. Soc._, vol. xix. p. 384) is that of the fleshy appendages\r\non the corners of the jaw of Normandy pigs and of some other breeds. But\r\nit is expressly stated that they are not constant; they appear\r\n\"frequently,\" or \"occasionally,\" they are \"not strictly inherited, for\r\nthey occur or fail in animals of the same litter;\" and they are not\r\nalways symmetrical, sometimes appearing on one side of the face alone.\r\nNow whatever may be the cause or explanation of these anomalous\r\nappendages they cannot be classed with \"specific characters,\" the most\r\nessential features of which are, that they _are_ symmetrical, that they\r\n_are_ inherited, and that they _are_ constant. Admitting that this\r\npeculiar appendage is (as Mr. Romanes says rather confidently, \"we\r\nhappen to know it to be\") wholly useless and meaningless, the fact would\r\nbe rather an argument against specific characters being also\r\nmeaningless, because the latter never have the characteristics which\r\nthis particular variation possesses.\r\n\r\nThese useless or non-adaptive characters are, apparently, of the same\r\nnature as the \"sports\" that arise in our domestic productions, but\r\nwhich, as Mr. Darwin says, without the aid of selection would soon\r\ndisappear; while some of them may be correlations with other characters\r\nwhich are or have been useful. Some of these correlations are very\r\ncurious. Mr. Tegetmeier informed Mr. Darwin that the young of white,\r\nyellow, or dun-coloured pigeons are born almost naked, whereas other\r\ncoloured pigeons are born well clothed with down. Now, if this\r\ndifference occurred between wild species of different colours, it might\r\nbe said that the nakedness of the young could not be of any use. But the\r\ncolour with which it is correlated might, as has been shown, be useful\r\nin many ways. The skin and its various appendages, as horns, hoofs,\r\nhair, feathers, and teeth, are homologous parts, and are subject to very\r\nstrange correlations of growth. In Paraguay, horses with curled hair\r\noccur, and these always have hoofs exactly like those of a mule, while\r\nthe hair of the mane and tail is much shorter than usual. Now, if any\r\none of these characters were useful, the others correlated with it might\r\nbe themselves useless, but would still be tolerably constant because\r\ndependent on a useful organ. So the tusks and the bristles of the boar\r\nare correlated and vary in development together, and the former only may\r\nbe useful, or both may be useful in unequal degrees.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty as to how individual differences or sports can become\r\nfixed and perpetuated, if altogether useless, is evaded by those who\r\nhold that such characters are exceedingly common. Mr. Romanes says that,\r\nupon his theory of physiological selection, \"it is quite intelligible\r\nthat when a varietal form is differentiated from its parent form by the\r\nbar of sterility, any little meaningless peculiarities of structure or\r\nof instinct _should at first be allowed to arise_, and that they should\r\nthen _be allowed to perpetuate themselves_ by heredity,\" until they are\r\nfinally eliminated by disuse. But this is entirely begging the\r\nquestion. Do meaningless peculiarities, which we admit often arise as\r\nspontaneous variations, ever perpetuate themselves in all the\r\nindividuals constituting a variety or race, without selection either\r\nhuman or natural? Such characters present themselves as unstable\r\nvariations, and as such they remain, unless preserved and accumulated by\r\nselection; and they can therefore never become \"specific\" characters\r\nunless they are strictly correlated with some useful and important\r\npeculiarities.\r\n\r\nAs bearing upon this question we may refer to what is termed Delboeuf's\r\nlaw, which has been thus briefly stated by Mr. Murphy in his work on\r\n_Habit and Intelligence_, p. 241.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"If, in any species, a number of individuals, bearing a ratio\r\n    not infinitely small to the entire number of births, are in\r\n    every generation born with a particular variation which is\r\n    neither beneficial nor injurious, and if it is not counteracted\r\n    by reversion, then the proportion of the new variety to the\r\n    original form will increase till it approaches indefinitely near\r\n    to equality.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not impossible that some definite varieties, such as the melanic\r\nform of the jaguar and the bridled variety of the guillemot are due to\r\nthis cause; but from their very nature such varieties are unstable, and\r\nare continually reproduced in varying proportions from the parent forms.\r\nThey can, therefore, never constitute species unless the variation in\r\nquestion becomes beneficial, when it will be fixed by natural selection.\r\nDarwin, it is true, says--\"There can be little doubt that the tendency\r\nto vary in the same manner has often been so strong that all the\r\nindividuals of the same species have been similarly modified without the\r\naid of any form of selection.\"[46] But no proof whatever is offered of\r\nthis statement, and it is so entirely opposed to all we know of the\r\nfacts of variation as given by Darwin himself, that the important word\r\n\"all\" is probably an oversight.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, I submit, not only has it not been proved that an\r\n\"enormous number of specific peculiarities\" are useless, and that, as a\r\nlogical result, natural selection is \"not a theory of the origin of\r\nspecies,\" but only of the origin of adaptations which are usually\r\ncommon to many species, or, more commonly, to genera and families; but,\r\nI urge further, it has not even been proved that any truly \"specific\"\r\ncharacters--those which either singly or in combination distinguish each\r\nspecies from its nearest allies--are entirely unadaptive, useless, and\r\nmeaningless; while a great body of facts on the one hand, and some\r\nweighty arguments on the other, alike prove that specific characters\r\nhave been, and could only have been, developed and fixed by natural\r\nselection because of their utility. We may admit, that among the great\r\nnumber of variations and sports which continually arise many are\r\naltogether useless without being hurtful; but no cause or influence has\r\nbeen adduced adequate to render such characters fixed and constant\r\nthroughout the vast number of individuals which constitute any of the\r\nmore dominant species.[47]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Swamping Effects of Intercrossing._\r\n\r\nThis supposed insuperable difficulty was first advanced in an article in\r\nthe _North British Review_ in 1867, and much attention has been\r\nattracted to it by the acknowledgment of Mr. Darwin that it proved to\r\nhim that \"single variations,\" or what are usually termed \"sports,\" could\r\nvery rarely, if ever, be perpetuated in a state of nature, as he had at\r\nfirst thought might occasionally be the case. But he had always\r\nconsidered that the chief part, and latterly the whole, of the materials\r\nwith which natural selection works, was afforded by individual\r\nvariations, or that amount of ever fluctuating variability which exists\r\nin all organisms and in all their parts. Other writers have urged the\r\nsame objection, even as against individual variability, apparently in\r\ntotal ignorance of its amount and range; and quite recently Professor\r\nG.J. Romanes has adduced it as one of the difficulties which can alone\r\nbe overcome by his theory of physiological selection. He urges, that the\r\nsame variation does not occur simultaneously in a number of individuals\r\ninhabiting the same area, and that it is mere assumption to say it does;\r\nwhile he admits that \"if the assumption were granted there would be an\r\nend of the present difficulty; for if a sufficient number of individuals\r\nwere thus simultaneously and similarly modified, there need be no longer\r\nany danger of the variety becoming swamped by intercrossing.\" I must\r\nagain refer my readers to my third chapter for the proof that such\r\nsimultaneous variability is not an assumption but a fact; but, even\r\nadmitting this to be proved, the problem is not altogether solved, and\r\nthere is so much misconception regarding variation, and the actual\r\nprocess of the origin of new species is so obscure, that some further\r\ndiscussion and elucidation of the subject are desirable.\r\n\r\nIn one of the preliminary chapters of Mr. Seebohm's recent work on the\r\n_Charadriidae_, he discusses the differentiation of species; and he\r\nexpresses a rather widespread view among naturalists when, speaking of\r\nthe swamping effects of intercrossing, he adds: \"This is unquestionably\r\na very grave difficulty, to my mind an absolutely fatal one, to the\r\ntheory of accidental variation.\" And in another passage he says: \"The\r\nsimultaneous appearance, and its repetition in successive generations,\r\nof a beneficial variation, in a large number of individuals in the same\r\nlocality, cannot possibly be ascribed to chance.\" These remarks appear\r\nto me to exhibit an entire misconception of the facts of variation as\r\nthey actually occur, and as they have been utilised by natural selection\r\nin the modification of species. I have already shown that every part of\r\nthe organism, in common species, does vary to a very considerable\r\namount, in a large number of individuals, and in the same locality; the\r\nonly point that remains to be discussed is, whether any or most of these\r\nvariations are \"beneficial.\" But every one of these variations consists\r\neither in increase or diminution of size or power of the organ or\r\nfaculty that varies; they can all be divided into a more effective and a\r\nless effective group--that is, into one that is more beneficial or less\r\nbeneficial. If less size of body would be beneficial, then, as half the\r\nvariations in size are above and half below the mean or existing\r\nstandard of the species, there would be ample beneficial variations; if\r\na darker colour or a longer beak or wing were required, there are always\r\na considerable number of individuals darker and lighter in colour than\r\nthe average, with longer or with shorter beaks and wings, and thus the\r\nbeneficial variation must always be present. And so with every other\r\npart, organ, function, or habit; because, as variation, so far as we\r\nknow, is and always must be in the two directions of excess and defect\r\nin relation to the mean amount, whichever kind of variation is wanted is\r\nalways present in some degree, and thus the difficulty as to\r\n\"beneficial\" variations occurring, as if they were a special and rare\r\nclass, falls to the ground. No doubt some organs may vary in three or\r\nperhaps more directions, as in the length, breadth, thickness, or\r\ncurvature of the bill. But these may be taken as separate variations,\r\neach of which again occurs as \"more\" or \"less\"; and thus the \"right\" or\r\n\"beneficial\" or \"useful\" variation must always be present so long as any\r\nvariation at all occurs; and it has not yet been proved that in any\r\nlarge or dominant species, or in any part, organ, or faculty of such\r\nspecies, there is no variation. And even were such a case found it would\r\nprove nothing, so long as in numerous other species variation was shown\r\nto exist; because we know that great numbers of species and groups\r\nthroughout all geological time have died out, leaving no descendants;\r\nand the obvious and sufficient explanation of this fact is, that they\r\ndid _not_ vary enough at the time when variation was required to bring\r\nthem into harmony with changed conditions. The objection as to the\r\n\"right\" or \"beneficial\" variation occurring when required, seems\r\ntherefore to have no weight in view of the actual facts of variation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Isolation to prevent Intercrossing._\r\n\r\nMost writers on the subject consider the isolation of a portion of a\r\nspecies a very important factor in the formation of new species, while\r\nothers maintain it to be absolutely essential. This latter view has\r\narisen from an exaggerated opinion as to the power of intercrossing to\r\nkeep down any variety or incipient species, and merge it in the parent\r\nstock. But it is evident that this can only occur with varieties which\r\nare not useful, or which, if useful, occur in very small numbers; and\r\nfrom this kind of variations it is clear that new species do not arise.\r\nComplete isolation, as in an oceanic island, will no doubt enable\r\nnatural selection to act more rapidly, for several reasons. In the first\r\nplace, the absence of competition will for some time allow the new\r\nimmigrants to increase rapidly till they reach the limits of\r\nsubsistence. They will then struggle among themselves, and by survival\r\nof the fittest will quickly become adapted to the new conditions of\r\ntheir environment. Organs which they formerly needed, to defend\r\nthemselves against, or to escape from, enemies, being no longer\r\nrequired, would be encumbrances to be got rid of, while the power of\r\nappropriating and digesting new and varied food would rise in\r\nimportance. Thus we may explain the origin of so many flightless and\r\nrather bulky birds in oceanic islands, as the dodo, the cassowary, and\r\nthe extinct moas. Again, while this process was going on, the complete\r\nisolation would prevent its being checked by the immigration of new\r\ncompetitors or enemies, which would be very likely to occur in a\r\ncontinuous area; while, of course, any intercrossing with the original\r\nunmodified stock would be absolutely prevented. If, now, before this\r\nchange has gone very far, the variety spreads into adjacent but rather\r\ndistant islands, the somewhat different conditions in each may lead to\r\nthe development of distinct forms constituting what are termed\r\nrepresentative species; and these we find in the separate islands of the\r\nGalapagos, the West Indies, and other ancient groups of islands.\r\n\r\nBut such cases as these will only lead to the production of a few\r\npeculiar species, descended from the original settlers which happened to\r\nreach the islands; whereas, in wide areas, and in continents, we have\r\nvariation and adaptation on a much larger scale; and, whenever important\r\nphysical changes demand them, with even greater rapidity. The far\r\ngreater complexity of the environment, together with the occurrence of\r\nvariations in constitution and habits, will often allow of effective\r\nisolation, even here, producing all the results of actual physical\r\nisolation. As we have already explained, one of the most frequent modes\r\nin which natural selection acts is, by adapting some individuals of a\r\nspecies to a somewhat different mode of life, whereby they are able to\r\nseize upon unappropriated places in nature, and in so doing they become\r\npractically isolated from their parent form. Let us suppose, for\r\nexample, that one portion of a species usually living in forests ranges\r\ninto the open plains, and finding abundance of food remains there\r\npermanently. So long as the struggle for existence is not exceptionally\r\nsevere, these two portions of the species may remain almost unchanged;\r\nbut suppose some fresh enemies are attracted to the plains by the\r\npresence of these new immigrants, then variation and natural selection\r\nwould lead to the preservation of those individuals best able to cope\r\nwith the difficulty, and thus the open country form would become\r\nmodified into a marked variety or into a distinct species; and there\r\nwould evidently be little chance of this modification being checked by\r\nintercrossing with the parent form which remained in the forest.\r\n\r\nAnother mode of isolation is brought about by the variety--either owing\r\nto habits, climate, or constitutional change--breeding at a slightly\r\ndifferent time from the parent species. This is known to produce\r\ncomplete isolation in the case of many varieties of plants. Yet another\r\nmode of isolation is brought about by changes of colour, and by the fact\r\nthat in a wild state animals of similar colours prefer to keep together\r\nand refuse to pair with individuals of another colour. The probable\r\nreason and utility of this habit will be explained in another chapter,\r\nbut the fact is well illustrated by the cattle which have run wild in\r\nthe Falkland Islands. These are of several different colours, but each\r\ncolour keeps in a separate herd, often restricted to one part of the\r\nisland; and one of these varieties--the mouse-coloured--is said to breed\r\na month earlier than the others; so that if this variety inhabited a\r\nlarger area it might very soon be established as a distinct race or\r\nspecies.[48] Of course where the change of habits or of station is still\r\ngreater, as when a terrestrial animal becomes sub-aquatic, or when\r\naquatic animals come to live in tree-tops, as with the frogs and\r\nCrustacea described at p. 118, the danger of intercrossing is reduced to\r\na minimum.\r\n\r\nSeveral writers, however, not content with the indirect effects of\r\nisolation here indicated, maintain that it is in itself a cause of\r\nmodification, and ultimately of the origination of new species. This\r\nwas the keynote of Mr. Vernon Wollaston's essay on \"Variation of\r\nSpecies,\" published in 1856, and it is adopted by the Rev. J.G. Gulick\r\nin his paper on \"Diversity of Evolution under one Set of External\r\nConditions\" (_Journ. Linn. Soc. Zool._, vol. xi. p. 496). The idea seems\r\nto be that there is an inherent tendency to variation in certain\r\ndivergent lines, and that when one portion of a species is isolated,\r\neven though under identical conditions, that tendency sets up a\r\ndivergence which carries that portion farther and farther away from the\r\noriginal species. This view is held to be supported by the case of the\r\nland shells of the Sandwich Islands, which certainly present some very\r\nremarkable phenomena. In this comparatively small area there are about\r\n300 species of land shells, almost all of which belong to one family (or\r\nsub-family), the Achatinellidae, found nowhere else in the world. The\r\ninteresting point is the extreme restriction of the species and\r\nvarieties. The average range of each species is only five or six miles,\r\nwhile some are restricted to but one or two square miles, and only a\r\nvery few range over a whole island. The forest region that extends over\r\none of the mountain-ranges of the island of Oahu, is about forty miles\r\nin length and five or six miles in breadth; and this small territory\r\nfurnishes about 175 species, represented by 700 or 800 varieties. Mr.\r\nGulick states, that the vegetation of the different valleys on the same\r\nside of this range is much the same, yet each has a molluscan fauna\r\ndiffering in some degree from that of any other. \"We frequently find a\r\ngenus represented in several successive valleys by allied species,\r\nsometimes feeding on the same, sometimes on different plants. In every\r\nsuch case the valleys that are nearest to each other furnish the most\r\nnearly allied forms; and a full set of the varieties of each species\r\npresents a minute gradation of forms between the more divergent types\r\nfound in the more widely separated localities.\" He urges, that these\r\nconstant differences cannot be attributed to natural selection, because\r\nthey occur in different valleys on the same side of the mountain, where\r\nfood, climate, and enemies are the same; and also, because there is no\r\ngreater difference in passing from the rainy to the dry side of the\r\nmountains than in passing from one valley to another on the same side\r\nan equal distance apart. In a very lengthy paper, presented to the\r\nLinnean Society last year, on \"Divergent Evolution through Cumulative\r\nSegregation,\" Mr. Gulick endeavours to work out his views into a\r\ncomplete theory, the main point of which may perhaps be indicated by the\r\nfollowing passage: \"No two portions of a species possess exactly the\r\nsame average character, and the initial differences are for ever\r\nreacting on the environment and on each other in such a way as to ensure\r\nincreasing divergence in each successive generation as long as the\r\nindividuals of the two groups are kept from intercrossing.\"[49]\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be said that the views of Mr. Darwin and myself are\r\ninconsistent with the notion that, if the environment were absolutely\r\nsimilar for the two isolated portions of the species, any such necessary\r\nand constant divergence would take place. It is an error to assume that\r\nwhat seem to us identical conditions are really identical to such small\r\nand delicate organisms as these land molluscs, of whose needs and\r\ndifficulties at each successive stage of their existence, from the\r\nfreshly-laid egg up to the adult animal, we are so profoundly ignorant.\r\nThe exact proportions of the various species of plants, the numbers of\r\neach kind of insect or of bird, the peculiarities of more or less\r\nexposure to sunshine or to wind at certain critical epochs, and other\r\nslight differences which to us are absolutely immaterial and\r\nunrecognisable, may be of the highest significance to these humble\r\ncreatures, and be quite sufficient to require some slight adjustments of\r\nsize, form, or colour, which natural selection will bring about. All we\r\nknow of the facts of variation leads us to believe that, without this\r\naction of natural selection, there would be produced over the whole area\r\na series of inconstant varieties mingled together, not a distinct\r\nsegregation of forms each confined to its own limited area.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin has shown that, in the distribution and modification of\r\nspecies, the biological is of more importance than the physical\r\nenvironment, the struggle with other organisms being often more severe\r\nthan that with the forces of nature. This is particularly evident in the\r\ncase of plants, many of which, when protected from competition, thrive\r\nin a soil, climate, and atmosphere widely different from those of their\r\nnative habitat. Thus, many alpine plants only found near perpetual snow\r\nthrive well in our gardens at the level of the sea; as do the tritomas\r\nfrom the sultry plains of South Africa, the yuccas from the arid hills\r\nof Texas and Mexico, and the fuchsias from the damp and dreary shores of\r\nthe Straits of Magellan. It has been well said that plants do not live\r\nwhere they like, but where they can; and the same remark will apply to\r\nthe animal world. Horses and cattle run wild and thrive both in North\r\nand South America; rabbits, once confined to the south of Europe, have\r\nestablished themselves in our own country and in Australia; while the\r\ndomestic fowl, a native of tropical India, thrives well in every part of\r\nthe temperate zone.\r\n\r\nIf, then, we admit that when one portion of a species is separated from\r\nthe rest, there will necessarily be a slight difference in the average\r\ncharacters of the two portions, it does not follow that this difference\r\nhas much if any effect upon the characteristics that are developed by a\r\nlong period of isolation. In the first place, the difference itself will\r\nnecessarily be very slight unless there is an exceptional amount of\r\nvariability in the species; and in the next place, if the average\r\ncharacters of the species are the expression of its exact adaptation to\r\nits whole environment, then, given a precisely similar environment, and\r\nthe isolated portion will inevitably be brought back to the same average\r\nof characters. But, as a matter of fact, it is impossible that the\r\nenvironment of the isolated portion can be exactly like that of the bulk\r\nof the species. It cannot be so physically, since no two separated areas\r\ncan be absolutely alike in climate and soil; and even if these are the\r\nsame, the geographical features, size, contour, and relation to winds,\r\nseas, and rivers, would certainly differ. Biologically, the differences\r\nare sure to be considerable. The isolated portion of a species will\r\nalmost always be in a much smaller area than that occupied by the\r\nspecies as a whole, hence it is at once in a different position as\r\nregards its own kind. The proportions of all the other species of\r\nanimals and plants are also sure to differ in the two areas, and some\r\nspecies will almost always be absent in the smaller which are present in\r\nthe larger country. These differences will act and react on the\r\nisolated portion of the species. The struggle for existence will differ\r\nin its severity and in its incidence from that which affects the bulk of\r\nthe species. The absence of some one insect or other creature inimical\r\nto the young animal or plant may cause a vast difference in its\r\nconditions of existence, and may necessitate a modification of its\r\nexternal or internal characters in quite a different direction from that\r\nwhich happened to be present in the average of the individuals which\r\nwere first isolated.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, we conclude that, while isolation is an important\r\nfactor in effecting some modification of species, it is so, not on\r\naccount of any effect produced, or influence exerted by isolation _per\r\nse_, but because it is always and necessarily accompanied by a change of\r\nenvironment, both physical and biological. Natural selection will then\r\nbegin to act in adapting the isolated portion to its new conditions, and\r\nwill do this the more quickly and the more effectually because of the\r\nisolation. We have, however, seen reason to believe that geographical or\r\nlocal isolation is by no means essential to the differentiation of\r\nspecies, because the same result is brought about by the incipient\r\nspecies acquiring different habits or frequenting a different station;\r\nand also by the fact that different varieties of the same species are\r\nknown to prefer to pair with their like, and thus to bring about a\r\nphysiological isolation of the most effective kind. This part of the\r\nsubject will be again referred to when the very difficult problems\r\npresented by hybridity are discussed.[50]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cases in which Isolation is Ineffective._\r\n\r\nOne objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe\r\nisolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves\r\nattention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a\r\n_vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an\r\nexcellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain\r\nsince the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet\r\nhardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the\r\nslightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference\r\nin the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not\r\noccurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe\r\nstruggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species;\r\nbut, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously\r\nand cumulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have\r\nbeen produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in\r\nthis, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not\r\nin itself a cause of modification.\r\n\r\nThere yet remain a number of difficulties and objections relating to the\r\nquestion of hybridity, which are so important as to require a separate\r\nchapter for their adequate discussion.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: See _Origin of Species_, pp. 176-198.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: See Kerner's _Flowers and their Unbidden Guests_ for\r\nnumerous other structures and peculiarities of plants which are shown to\r\nbe adaptive and useful.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: _Nature_, vol. xx. p. 603.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: _Nature_, vol. xxxviii. p. 328.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: A very remarkable illustration of function in an\r\napparently useless ornament is given by Semper. He says, \"It is known\r\nthat the skin of reptiles encloses the body with scales. These scales\r\nare distinguished by very various sculpturings, highly characteristic of\r\nthe different species. Irrespective of their systematic significance\r\nthey appear to be of no value in the life of the animal; indeed, they\r\nare viewed as ornamental without regard to the fact that they are\r\nmicroscopic and much too delicate to be visible to other animals of\r\ntheir own species. It might, therefore, seem hopeless to show the\r\nnecessity for their existence on Darwinian principles, and to prove that\r\nthey are physiologically active organs. Nevertheless, recent\r\ninvestigations on this point have furnished evidence that this is\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\"It is known that many reptiles, and above all the snakes, cast off the\r\nwhole skin at once, whereas human beings do so by degrees. If by any\r\naccident they are prevented doing so, they infallibly die, because the\r\nold skin has grown so tough and hard that it hinders the increase in\r\nvolume which is inseparable from the growth of the animal. The casting\r\nof the skin is induced by the formation on the surface of the inner\r\nepidermis, of a layer of very fine and equally distributed hairs, which\r\nevidently serve the purpose of mechanically raising the old skin by\r\ntheir rigidity and position. These hairs then may be designated as\r\n_casting hairs_. That they are destined and calculated for this end is\r\nevident to me from the fact established by Dr. Braun, that the casting\r\nof the shells of the river crayfish is induced in exactly the same\r\nmanner by the formation of a coating of hairs which mechanically loosens\r\nthe old skin or shell from the new. Now the researches of Braun and\r\nCartier have shown that these casting hairs--which serve the same\r\npurpose in two groups of animals so far apart in the systematic\r\nscale--after the casting, are partly transformed into the concentric\r\nstripes, sharp spikes, ridges, or warts which ornament the outer edges\r\nof the skin-scales of reptiles or the carapace of crabs.\"[1] Professor\r\nSemper adds that this example, with many others that might be quoted,\r\nshows that we need not abandon the hope of explaining morphological\r\ncharacters on Darwinian principles, although their nature is often\r\ndifficult to understand.\r\n\r\nDuring a recent discussion of this question in the pages of _Nature_,\r\nMr. St. George Mivart adduces several examples of what he deems useless\r\nspecific characters. Among them are the aborted index finger of the\r\nlemurine Potto, and the thumbless hands of Colobus and Ateles, the\r\n\"life-saving action\" of either of which he thinks incredible. These\r\ncases suggest two remarks. In the first place, they involve _generic_,\r\nnot _specific_, characters; and the three genera adduced are somewhat\r\nisolated, implying considerable antiquity and the extinction of many\r\nallied forms. This is important, because it affords ample time for great\r\nchanges of conditions since the structures in question originated; and\r\nwithout a knowledge of these changes we can never safely assert that any\r\ndetail of structure could not have been useful. In the second place, all\r\nthree are cases of aborted or rudimentary organs; and these are admitted\r\nto be explained by non-use, leading to diminution of size, a further\r\nreduction being brought about by the action of the principle of economy\r\nof growth. But, when so reduced, the rudiment might be inconvenient or\r\neven hurtful, and then natural selection would aid in its complete\r\nabortion; in other words, the abortion of the part would be _useful_,\r\nand would therefore be subject to the law of survival of the fittest.\r\nThe genera Ateles and Colobus are two of the most purely arboreal types\r\nof monkeys, and it is not difficult to conceive that the constant use of\r\nthe elongated fingers for climbing from tree to tree, and catching on to\r\nbranches while making great leaps, might require all the nervous energy\r\nand muscular growth to be directed to the fingers, the small thumb\r\nremaining useless. The case of the Potto is more difficult, both because\r\nit is, presumably, a more ancient type, and its actual life-history and\r\nhabits are completely unknown. These cases are, therefore, not at all to\r\nthe point as proving that positive specific characters--not mere\r\nrudiments characterising whole genera--are in any case useless.\r\n\r\nMr. Mivart further objects to the alleged rigidity of the action of\r\nnatural selection, because wounded or malformed animals have been found\r\nwhich had evidently lived a considerable time in their imperfect\r\ncondition. But this simply proves that they were living under a\r\ntemporarily favourable environment, and that the real struggle for\r\nexistence, in their case, had not yet taken place. We must surely admit\r\nthat, when the pinch came, and when perfectly formed stoats were dying\r\nfor want of food, the one-footed animal, referred to by Mr. Mivart,\r\nwould be among the first to succumb; and the same remark will apply to\r\nhis abnormally toothed hares and rheumatic monkeys, which might,\r\nnevertheless, get on very well under favourable conditions. The struggle\r\nfor existence, under which all animals and plants have been developed,\r\nis intermittent, and exceedingly irregular in its incidence and\r\nseverity. It is most severe and fatal to the young; but when an animal\r\nhas once reached maturity, and especially when it has gained experience\r\nby several years of an eventful existence, it may be able to maintain\r\nitself under conditions which would be fatal to a young and\r\ninexperienced creature of the same species. The examples adduced by Mr.\r\nMivart do not, therefore, in any way impugn the hardness of nature as a\r\ntaskmaster, or the extreme severity of the recurring struggle for\r\nexistence. (See _Nature_, vol. xxxix. p. 127.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: _Origin of Species,_ p. 72.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: Darwin's latest expression of opinion on this question is\r\ninteresting, since it shows that he was inclined to return to his\r\nearlier view of the general, or universal, utility of specific\r\ncharacters. In a letter to Semper (30th Nov. 1878) he writes: \"As our\r\nknowledge advances, very slight differences, considered by systematists\r\nas of no importance in structure, are continually found to be\r\nfunctionally important; and I have been especially struck with this fact\r\nin the case of plants, to which my observations have, of late years,\r\nbeen confined. Therefore it seems to me rather rash to consider slight\r\ndifferences between representative species, for instance, those\r\ninhabiting the different islands of the same archipelago, as of no\r\nfunctional importance, and as not in any way due to natural selection\"\r\n_(Life of Darwin_, vol. iii. p. 161).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: See _Variation of Animals and Plants_, vol. i. p. 86.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: _Journal of the Linnean Society, Zoology,_ vol. xx. p.\r\n215.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: In Mr. Gulick's last paper (_Journal of Linn.

Zool._,\r\nvol. xx. pp. 189-274) he discusses the various forms of isolation above\r\nreferred to, under no less than thirty-eight different divisions and\r\nsubdivisions, with an elaborate terminology, and he argues that these\r\nwill frequently bring about divergent evolution without any change in\r\nthe environment or any action of natural selection. The discussion of\r\nthe problem here given will, I believe, sufficiently expose the fallacy\r\nof his contention; but his illustration of the varied and often\r\nrecondite modes by which practical isolation may be brought about, may\r\nhelp to remove one of the popular difficulties in the way of the action\r\nof natural selection in the origination of species.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nON THE INFERTILITY OF CROSSES BETWEEN DISTINCT SPECIES AND THE USUAL\r\nSTERILITY OF THEIR HYBRID OFFSPRING\r\n\r\n\r\n    Statement of the problem--Extreme susceptibility of the\r\n    reproductive functions--Reciprocal crosses--Individual\r\n    differences in respect to cross-fertilisation--Dimorphism and\r\n    trimorphism among plants--Cases of the fertility of hybrids and\r\n    of the infertility of mongrels--The effects of close\r\n    interbreeding--Mr. Huth's objections--Fertile hybrids among\r\n    animals--Fertility of hybrids among plants--Cases of sterility\r\n    of mongrels--Parallelism between crossing and change of\r\n    conditions--Remarks on the facts of hybridity--Sterility due to\r\n    changed conditions and usually correlated with other\r\n    characters--Correlation of colour with constitutional\r\n    peculiarities--The isolation of varieties by selective\r\n    association--The influence of natural selection upon sterility\r\n    and fertility--Physiological selection--Summary and concluding\r\n    remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest, or perhaps we may say the greatest, of all the\r\ndifficulties in the way of accepting the theory of natural selection as\r\na complete explanation of the origin of species, has been the remarkable\r\ndifference between varieties and species in respect of fertility when\r\ncrossed. Generally speaking, it may be said that the varieties of any\r\none species, however different they may be in external appearance, are\r\nperfectly fertile when crossed, and their mongrel offspring are equally\r\nfertile when bred among themselves; while distinct species, on the other\r\nhand, however closely they may resemble each other externally, are\r\nusually infertile when crossed, and their hybrid offspring absolutely\r\nsterile. This used to be considered a fixed law of nature, constituting\r\nthe absolute test and criterion of a _species_ as distinct from a\r\n_variety_; and so long as it was believed that species were separate\r\ncreations, or at all events had an origin quite distinct from that of\r\nvarieties, this law could have no exceptions, because, if any two\r\nspecies had been found to be fertile when crossed and their hybrid\r\noffspring to be also fertile, this fact would have been held to prove\r\nthem to be not _species_ but _varieties_. On the other hand, if two\r\nvarieties had been found to be infertile, or their mongrel offspring to\r\nbe sterile, then it would have been said: These are not varieties but\r\ntrue species. Thus the old theory led to inevitable reasoning in a\r\ncircle; and what might be only a rather common fact was elevated into a\r\nlaw which had no exceptions.\r\n\r\nThe elaborate and careful examination of the whole subject by Mr.\r\nDarwin, who has brought together a vast mass of evidence from the\r\nexperience of agriculturists and horticulturists, as well as from\r\nscientific experimenters, has demonstrated that there is no such fixed\r\nlaw in nature as was formerly supposed. He shows us that crosses between\r\nsome varieties are infertile or even sterile, while crosses between some\r\nspecies are quite fertile; and that there are besides a number of\r\ncurious phenomena connected with the subject which render it impossible\r\nto believe that sterility is anything more than an incidental property\r\nof species, due to the extreme delicacy and susceptibility of the\r\nreproductive powers, and dependent on physiological causes we have not\r\nyet been able to trace. Nevertheless, the fact remains that most species\r\nwhich have hitherto been crossed produce sterile hybrids, as in the\r\nwell-known case of the mule; while almost all domestic varieties, when\r\ncrossed, produce offspring which are perfectly fertile among themselves.\r\nI will now endeavour to give such a sketch of the subject as may enable\r\nthe reader to see something of the complexity of the problem, referring\r\nhim to Mr. Darwin's works for fuller details.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extreme Susceptibility of the Reproductive Functions._\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting facts, as showing how susceptible to changed\r\nconditions or to slight constitutional changes are the reproductive\r\npowers of animals, is the very general difficulty of getting those which\r\nare kept in confinement to breed; and this is frequently the only bar to\r\ndomesticating wild species. Thus, elephants, bears, foxes, and numbers\r\nof species of rodents, very rarely breed in confinement; while other\r\nspecies do so more or less freely. Hawks, vultures, and owls hardly ever\r\nbreed in confinement; neither did the falcons kept for hawking ever\r\nbreed. Of the numerous small seed-eating birds kept in aviaries, hardly\r\nany breed, neither do parrots. Gallinaceous birds usually breed freely\r\nin confinement, but some do not; and even the guans and curassows, kept\r\ntame by the South American Indians, never breed. This shows that change\r\nof climate has nothing to do with the phenomenon; and, in fact, the same\r\nspecies that refuse to breed in Europe do so, in almost every case, when\r\ntamed or confined in their native countries. This inability to reproduce\r\nis not due to ill-health, since many of these creatures are perfectly\r\nvigorous and live very long.\r\n\r\nWith our true domestic animals, on the other hand, fertility is perfect,\r\nand is very little affected by changed conditions. Thus, we see the\r\ncommon fowl, a native of tropical India, living and multiplying in\r\nalmost every part of the world; and the same is the case with our\r\ncattle, sheep, and goats, our dogs and horses, and especially with\r\ndomestic pigeons. It therefore seems probable, that this facility for\r\nbreeding under changed conditions was an original property of the\r\nspecies which man has domesticated--a property which, more than any\r\nother, enabled him to domesticate them. Yet, even with these, there is\r\nevidence that great changes of conditions affect the fertility. In the\r\nhot valleys of the Andes sheep are less fertile; while geese taken to\r\nthe high plateau of Bogota were at first almost sterile, but after some\r\ngenerations recovered their fertility. These and many other facts seem\r\nto show that, with the majority of animals, even a slight change of\r\nconditions may produce infertility or sterility; and also that after a\r\ntime, when the animal has become thoroughly acclimatised, as it were, to\r\nthe new conditions, the infertility is in some cases diminished or\r\naltogether ceases. It is stated by Bechstein that the canary was long\r\ninfertile, and it is only of late years that good breeding birds have\r\nbecome common; but in this case no doubt selection has aided the change.\r\n\r\nAs showing that these phenomena depend on deep-seated causes and are of\r\na very general nature, it is interesting to note that they occur also\r\nin the vegetable kingdom. Allowing for all the circumstances which are\r\nknown to prevent the production of seed, such as too great luxuriance of\r\nfoliage, too little or too much heat, or the absence of insects to\r\ncross-fertilise the flowers, Mr. Darwin shows that many species which\r\ngrow and flower with us, apparently in perfect health, yet never produce\r\nseed. Other plants are affected by very slight changes of conditions,\r\nproducing seed freely in one soil and not in another, though apparently\r\ngrowing equally well in both; while, in some cases, a difference of\r\nposition even in the same garden produces a similar result.[51]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reciprocal Crosses._\r\n\r\nAnother indication of the extreme delicacy of the adjustment between the\r\nsexes, which is necessary to produce fertility, is afforded by the\r\nbehaviour of many species and varieties when reciprocally crossed. This\r\nwill be best illustrated by a few of the examples furnished us by Mr.\r\nDarwin. The two distinct species of plants, Mirabilis jalapa and M.\r\nlongiflora, can be easily crossed, and will produce healthy and fertile\r\nhybrids when the pollen of the latter is applied to the stigma of the\r\nformer plant. But the same experimenter, Kölreuter, tried in vain, more\r\nthan two hundred times during eight years, to cross them by applying the\r\npollen of M. jalapa to the stigma of M. longiflora. In other cases two\r\nplants are so closely allied that some botanists class them as varieties\r\n(as with Matthiola annua and M. glabra), and yet there is the same great\r\ndifference in the result when they are reciprocally crossed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Individual Differences in respect to Cross-Fertilisation._\r\n\r\nA still more remarkable illustration of the delicate balance of\r\norganisation needful for reproduction, is afforded by the individual\r\ndifferences of animals and plants, as regards both their power of\r\nintercrossing with other individuals or other species, and the fertility\r\nof the offspring thus produced. Among domestic animals, Darwin states\r\nthat it is by no means rare to find certain males and females which will\r\nnot breed together, though both are known to be perfectly fertile with\r\nother males and females. Cases of this kind have occurred among horses,\r\ncattle, pigs, dogs, and pigeons; and the experiment has been tried so\r\nfrequently that there can be no doubt of the fact. Professor G.J.\r\nRomanes states that he has a number of additional cases of this\r\nindividual incompatibility, or of absolute sterility, between two\r\nindividuals, each of which is perfectly fertile with other individuals.\r\n\r\nDuring the numerous experiments that have been made on the hybridisation\r\nof plants similar peculiarities have been noticed, some individuals\r\nbeing capable, others incapable, of being crossed with a distinct\r\nspecies. The same individual peculiarities are found in varieties,\r\nspecies, and genera. Kölreuter crossed five varieties of the common\r\ntobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) with a distinct species, Nicotiana\r\nglutinosa, and they all yielded very sterile hybrids; but those raised\r\nfrom one variety were less sterile, in all the experiments, than the\r\nhybrids from the four other varieties. Again, most of the species of the\r\ngenus Nicotiana have been crossed, and freely produce hybrids; but one\r\nspecies, N. acuminata, not particularly distinct from the others, could\r\nneither fertilise, nor be fertilised by, any of the eight other species\r\nexperimented on. Among genera we find some--such as Hippeastrum, Crinum,\r\nCalceolaria, Dianthus--almost all the species of which will fertilise\r\nother species and produce hybrid offspring; while other allied genera,\r\nas Zephyranthes and Silene, notwithstanding the most persevering\r\nefforts, have not produced a single hybrid even between the most closely\r\nallied species.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dimorphism and Trimorphism._\r\n\r\nPeculiarities in the reproductive system affecting individuals of the\r\nsame species reach their maximum in what are called heterostyled, or\r\ndimorphic and trimorphic flowers, the phenomena presented by which form\r\none of the most remarkable of Mr. Darwin's many discoveries. Our common\r\ncowslip and primrose, as well as many other species of the genus\r\nPrimula, have two kinds of flowers in about equal proportions. In one\r\nkind the stamens are short, being situated about the middle of the tube\r\nof the corolla, while the style is long, the globular stigma appearing\r\njust in the centre of the open flower. In the other kind the stamens are\r\nlong, appearing in the centre or throat of the flower, while the style\r\nis short, the stigma being situated halfway down the tube at the same\r\nlevel as the stamens in the other form. These two forms have long been\r\nknown to florists as the \"pin-eyed\" and the \"thrum-eyed,\" but they are\r\ncalled by Darwin the long-styled and short-styled forms (see woodcut).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--Primula veris (Cowslip).]\r\n\r\nThe meaning and use of these different forms was quite unknown till\r\nDarwin discovered, first, that cowslips and primroses are absolutely\r\nbarren if insects are prevented from visiting them, and then, what is\r\nstill more extraordinary, that each form is almost sterile when\r\nfertilised by its own pollen, and comparatively infertile when crossed\r\nwith any other plant of its own form, but is perfectly fertile when the\r\npollen of a long-styled is carried to the stigma of a short-styled\r\nplant, or _vice versâ_. It will be seen, by the figures, that the\r\narrangement is such that a bee visiting the flowers will carry the\r\npollen from the long anthers of the short-styled form to the stigma of\r\nthe long-styled form, while it would never reach the stigma of another\r\nplant of the short-styled form. But an insect visiting, first, a\r\nlong-styled plant, would deposit the pollen on the stigma of another\r\nplant of the same kind if it were next visited; and this is probably the\r\nreason why the wild short-styled plants were found to be almost always\r\nmost productive of seed, since they must be all fertilised by the other\r\nform, whereas the long-styled plants might often be fertilised by their\r\nown form. The whole arrangement, however, ensures cross-fertilisation;\r\nand this, as Mr. Darwin has shown by copious experiments, adds both to\r\nthe vigour and fertility of almost all plants as well as animals.\r\n\r\nBesides the primrose family, many other plants of several distinct\r\nnatural orders present similar phenomena, one or two of the most curious\r\nof which must be referred to. The beautiful crimson flax (Linum\r\ngrandiflorum) has also two forms, the styles only differing in length;\r\nand in this case Mr. Darwin found by numerous experiments, which have\r\nsince been repeated and confirmed by other observers, that each form is\r\nabsolutely sterile with pollen from another plant of its own form, but\r\nabundantly fertile when crossed with any plant of the other form. In\r\nthis case the pollen of the two forms cannot be distinguished under the\r\nmicroscope (whereas that of the two forms of Primula differs in size and\r\nshape), yet it has the remarkable property of being absolutely powerless\r\non the stigmas of half the plants of its own species. The crosses\r\nbetween the opposite forms, which are fertile, are termed by Mr. Darwin\r\n\"legitimate,\" and those between similar forms, which are sterile,\r\n\"illegitimate\"; and he remarks that we have here, within the limits of\r\nthe same species, a degree of sterility which rarely occurs except\r\nbetween plants or animals not only of different _species_ but of\r\ndifferent _genera_.\r\n\r\nBut there is another set of plants, the trimorphic, in which the styles\r\nand stamens have each three forms--long, medium, and short, and in these\r\nit is possible to have eighteen different crosses. By an elaborate\r\nseries of experiments it was shown that the six legitimate unions--that\r\nis, when a plant was fertilised by pollen from stamens of length\r\ncorresponding to that of its style in the two other forms--were all\r\nabundantly fertile; while the twelve illegitimate unions, when a plant\r\nwas fertilised by pollen from stamens of a different length from its\r\nown style, in any of the three forms, were either comparatively or\r\nwholly sterile.[52]\r\n\r\nWe have here a wonderful amount of constitutional difference of the\r\nreproductive organs within a single species, greater than usually occurs\r\nwithin the numerous distinct species of a genus or group of genera; and\r\nall this diversity appears to have arisen for a purpose which has been\r\nobtained by many other, and apparently simpler, changes of structure or\r\nof function, in other plants. This seems to show us, in the first place,\r\nthat variations in the mutual relations of the reproductive organs of\r\ndifferent individuals must be as frequent as structural variations have\r\nbeen shown to be; and, also, that sterility in itself can be no test of\r\nspecific distinctness. But this point will be better considered when we\r\nhave further illustrated and discussed the complex phenomena of\r\nhybridity.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cases of the Fertility of Hybrids, and of the Infertility of Mongrels._\r\n\r\nI now propose to adduce a few cases in which it has been proved, by\r\nexperiment, that hybrids between two distinct species are fertile _inter\r\nse_; and then to consider why it is that such cases are so few in\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nThe common domestic goose (Anser ferns) and the Chinese goose (A.\r\ncygnoides) are very distinct species, so distinct that some naturalists\r\nhave placed them in different genera; yet they have bred together, and\r\nMr. Eyton raised from a pair of these hybrids a brood of eight. This\r\nfact was confirmed by Mr. Darwin himself, who raised several fine birds\r\nfrom a pair of hybrids which were sent him.[53] In India, according to\r\nMr. Blyth and Captain Hutton, whole flocks of these hybrid geese are\r\nkept in various parts of the country where neither of the pure parent\r\nspecies exists, and as they are kept for profit they must certainly be\r\nfully fertile.\r\n\r\nAnother equally striking case is that of the Indian humped and the\r\ncommon cattle, species which differ osteologically, and also in habits,\r\nform, voice, and constitution, so that they are by no means closely\r\nallied; yet Mr. Darwin assures us that he has received decisive\r\nevidence that the hybrids between these are perfectly fertile _inter\r\nse_.\r\n\r\nDogs have been frequently crossed with wolves and with jackals, and\r\ntheir hybrid offspring have been found to be fertile _inter se_ to the\r\nthird or fourth generation, and then usually to show some signs of\r\nsterility or of deterioration. The wolf and dog may be originally the\r\nsame species, but the jackal is certainly distinct; and the appearance\r\nof infertility or of weakness is probably due to the fact that, in\r\nalmost all these experiments, the offspring of a single pair--themselves\r\nusually from the same litter--- were bred in-and-in, and this alone\r\nsometimes produces the most deleterious effects. Thus, Mr. Low in his\r\ngreat work on the _Domesticated Animals of Great Britain_, says: \"If we\r\nshall breed a pair of dogs from the same litter, and unite again the\r\noffspring of this pair, we shall produce at once a feeble race of\r\ncreatures; and the process being repeated for one or two generations\r\nmore, the family will die out, or be incapable of propagating their\r\nrace. A gentleman of Scotland made the experiment on a large scale with\r\ncertain foxhounds, and he found that the race actually became monstrous\r\nand perished utterly.\" The same writer tells us that hogs have been made\r\nthe subject of similar experiments: \"After a few generations the victims\r\nmanifest the change induced in the system. They become of diminished\r\nsize; the bristles are changed into hairs; the limbs become feeble and\r\nshort; the litters diminish in frequency, and in the number of the young\r\nproduced; the mother becomes unable to nourish them, and, if the\r\nexperiment be carried as far as the case will allow, the feeble, and\r\nfrequently monstrous offspring, will be incapable of being reared up,\r\nand the miserable race will utterly perish.\"[54]\r\n\r\nThese precise statements, by one of the greatest authorities on our\r\ndomesticated animals, are sufficient to show that the fact of\r\ninfertility or degeneracy appearing in the offspring of hybrids after a\r\nfew generations need not be imputed to the fact of the first parents\r\nbeing distinct species, since exactly the same phenomena appear when\r\nindividuals of the same species are bred under similar adverse\r\nconditions. But in almost all the experiments that have hitherto been\r\nmade in crossing distinct species, no care has been taken to avoid close\r\ninterbreeding by securing several hybrids from quite distinct stocks to\r\nstart with, and by having two or more sets of experiments carried on at\r\nonce, so that crosses between the hybrids produced may be occasionally\r\nmade. Till this is done no experiments, such as those hitherto tried,\r\ncan be held to prove that hybrids are in all cases infertile _inter se_.\r\n\r\nIt has, however, been denied by Mr. A.H. Huth, in his interesting work\r\non _The Marriage of Near Kin_, that any amount of breeding in-and-in is\r\nin itself hurtful; and he quotes the evidence of numerous breeders whose\r\nchoicest stocks have always been so bred, as well as cases like the\r\nPorto Santo rabbits, the goats of Juan Fernandez, and other cases in\r\nwhich animals allowed to run wild have increased prodigiously and\r\ncontinued in perfect health and vigour, although all derived from a\r\nsingle pair. But in all these cases there has been rigid selection by\r\nwhich the weak or the infertile have been eliminated, and with such\r\nselection there is no doubt that the ill effects of close interbreeding\r\ncan be prevented for a long time; but this by no means proves that no\r\nill effects are produced. Mr. Huth himself quotes M. Allié, M. Aubé,\r\nStephens, Giblett, Sir John Sebright, Youatt, Druce, Lord Weston, and\r\nother eminent breeders, as finding from experience that close\r\ninterbreeding _does_ produce bad effects; and it cannot be supposed that\r\nthere would be such a consensus of opinion on this point if the evil\r\nwere altogether imaginary. Mr. Huth argues, that the evil results which\r\ndo occur do not depend on the close interbreeding itself, but on the\r\ntendency it has to perpetuate any constitutional weakness or other\r\nhereditary taints; and he attempts to prove this by the argument that\r\n\"if crosses act by virtue of being a cross, and not by virtue of\r\nremoving an hereditary taint, then the greater the difference between\r\nthe two animals crossed the more beneficial will that act be.\" He then\r\nshows that, the wider the difference the less is the benefit, and\r\nconcludes that a cross, as such, has no beneficial effect. A parallel\r\nargument would be, that change of air, as from inland to the sea-coast,\r\nor from a low to an elevated site, is not beneficial in itself, because,\r\nif so, a change to the tropics or to the polar regions should be more\r\nbeneficial. In both these cases it may well be that no benefit would\r\naccrue to a person in perfect health; but then there is no such thing\r\nas \"perfect health\" in man, and probably no such thing as absolute\r\nfreedom from constitutional taint in animals. The experiments of Mr.\r\nDarwin, showing the great and immediate good effects of a cross between\r\ndistinct strains in plants, cannot be explained away; neither can the\r\ninnumerable arrangements to secure cross-fertilisation by insects, the\r\nreal use and purport of which will be discussed in our eleventh chapter.\r\nOn the whole, then, the evidence at our command proves that, whatever\r\nmay be its ultimate cause, close interbreeding _does_ usually produce\r\nbad results; and it is only by the most rigid selection, whether natural\r\nor artificial, that the danger can be altogether obviated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fertile Hybrids among Animals._\r\n\r\nOne or two more cases of fertile hybrids may be given before we pass on\r\nto the corresponding experiments in plants. Professor Alfred Newton\r\nreceived from a friend a pair of hybrid ducks, bred from a common duck\r\n(Anas boschas), and a pintail (Dafila acuta). From these he obtained\r\nfour ducklings, but these latter, when grown up, proved infertile, and\r\ndid not breed again. In this case we have the results of close\r\ninterbreeding, with too great a difference between the original species,\r\ncombining to produce infertility, yet the fact of a hybrid from such a\r\npair producing healthy offspring is itself noteworthy.\r\n\r\nStill more extraordinary is the following statement of Mr. Low: \"It has\r\nbeen long known to shepherds, though questioned by naturalists, that the\r\nprogeny of the cross between the sheep and goat is fertile. Breeds of\r\nthis mixed race are numerous in the north of Europe.\"[55] Nothing\r\nappears to be known of such hybrids either in Scandinavia or in Italy;\r\nbut Professor Giglioli of Florence has kindly given me some useful\r\nreferences to works in which they are described. The following extract\r\nfrom his letter is very interesting: \"I need not tell you that there\r\nbeing such hybrids is now generally accepted as a fact. Buffon\r\n(_Supplements_, tom. iii. p. 7, 1756) obtained one such hybrid in 1751\r\nand eight in 1752. Sanson (_La Culture_, vol. vi. p. 372, 1865) mentions\r\na case observed in the Vosges, France. Geoff. St. Hilaire (_Hist. Nat.\r\nGén. des reg. org._, vol. iii. p. 163) was the first to mention, I\r\nbelieve, that in different parts of South America the ram is more\r\nusually crossed with the she-goat than the sheep with the he-goat. The\r\nwell-known 'pellones' of Chile are produced by the second and third\r\ngeneration of such hybrids (Gay, 'Hist, de Chile,' vol. i. p. 466,\r\n_Agriculture_, 1862). Hybrids bred from goat and sheep are called\r\n'chabin' in French, and 'cabruno' in Spanish. In Chile such hybrids are\r\ncalled 'carneros lanudos'; their breeding _inter se_ appears to be not\r\nalways successful, and often the original cross has to be recommenced to\r\nobtain the proportion of three-eighths of he-goat and five-eighths of\r\nsheep, or of three-eighths of ram and five-eighths of she-goat; such\r\nbeing the reputed best hybrids.\"\r\n\r\nWith these numerous facts recorded by competent observers we can hardly\r\ndoubt that races of hybrids between these very distinct species have\r\nbeen produced, and that such hybrids are fairly fertile _inter se_; and\r\nthe analogous facts already given lead us to believe that whatever\r\namount of infertility may at first exist could be eliminated by careful\r\nselection, if the crossed races were bred in large numbers and over a\r\nconsiderable area of country. This case is especially valuable, as\r\nshowing how careful we should be in assuming the infertility of hybrids\r\nwhen experiments have been made with the progeny of a single pair, and\r\nhave been continued only for one or two generations.\r\n\r\nAmong insects one case only appears to have been recorded. The hybrids\r\nof two moths (Bombyx cynthia and B. arrindia) were proved in Paris,\r\naccording to M. Quatrefages, to be fertile _inter se_ for eight\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fertility of Hybrids among Plants._\r\n\r\nAmong plants the cases of fertile hybrids are more numerous, owing, in\r\npart, to the large scale on which they are grown by gardeners and\r\nnurserymen, and to the greater facility with which experiments can be\r\nmade. Darwin tells us that Kölreuter found ten cases in which two plants\r\nconsidered by botanists to be distinct species were quite fertile\r\ntogether, and he therefore ranked them all as varieties of each other.\r\nIn some cases these were grown for six to ten successive generations,\r\nbut after a time the fertility decreased, as we saw to be the case in\r\nanimals, and presumably from the same cause, too close interbreeding.\r\n\r\nDean Herbert, who carried on experiments with great care and skill for\r\nmany years, found numerous cases of hybrids which were perfectly fertile\r\n_inter se_. Crinum capense, fertilised by three other species--C.\r\npedunculatum, C. canaliculatum, or C. defixum--all very distinct from\r\nit, produced perfectly fertile hybrids; while other species less\r\ndifferent in appearance were quite sterile with the same C. capense.\r\n\r\nAll the species of the genus Hippeastrum produce hybrid offspring which\r\nare invariably fertile. Lobelia syphylitica and L. fulgens, two very\r\ndistinct species, have produced a hybrid which has been named Lobelia\r\nspeciosa, and which reproduces itself abundantly. Many of the beautiful\r\npelargoniums of our greenhouses are hybrids, such as P. ignescens from a\r\ncross between P. citrinodorum and P. fulgidum, which is quite fertile,\r\nand has become the parent of innumerable varieties of beautiful plants.\r\nAll the varied species of Calceolaria, however different in appearance,\r\nintermix with the greatest readiness, and the hybrids are all more or\r\nless fertile. But the most remarkable case is that of two species of\r\nPetunia, of which Dean Herbert says: \"It is very remarkable that,\r\nalthough there is a great difference in the form of the flower,\r\nespecially of the tube, of P. nyctanigenaeflora and P. phoenicea the\r\nmules between them are not only fertile, but I have found them seed much\r\nmore freely with me than either parent.... From a pod of the\r\nabove-mentioned mule, to which no pollen but its own had access, I had a\r\nlarge batch of seedlings in which there was no variability or difference\r\nfrom itself; and it is evident that the mule planted by itself, in a\r\ncongenial climate, would reproduce itself as a species; at least as much\r\ndeserving to be so considered as the various Calceolarias of different\r\ndistricts of South America.\"[56]\r\n\r\nDarwin was informed by Mr. C. Noble that he raises stocks for grafting\r\nfrom a hybrid between Rhododendron ponticum and R. catawbiense, and that\r\nthis hybrid seeds as freely as it is possible to imagine. He adds that\r\nhorticulturists raise large beds of the same hybrid, and such alone are\r\nfairly treated; for, by insect agency, the several individuals are\r\nfreely crossed with each other, and the injurious influence of close\r\ninterbreeding is thus prevented. Had hybrids, when fairly treated,\r\nalways gone on decreasing in fertility in each successive generation, as\r\nGartner believed to be the case, the fact would have been notorious to\r\nnurserymen.[57]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cases of Sterility of Mongrels._\r\n\r\nThe reverse phenomenon to the fertility of hybrids, the sterility of\r\nmongrels or of the crosses between _varieties_ of the same species, is a\r\ncomparatively rare one, yet some undoubted cases have occurred. Gartner,\r\nwho believed in the absolute distinctness of species and varieties, had\r\ntwo varieties of maize--one dwarf with yellow seeds, the other taller\r\nwith red seeds; yet they never naturally crossed, and, when fertilised\r\nartificially, only a single head produced any seeds, and this one only\r\nfive grains. Yet these few seeds were fertile; so that in this case the\r\nfirst cross was almost sterile, though the hybrid when at length\r\nproduced was fertile. In like manner, dissimilarly coloured varieties of\r\nVerbascum or mullein have been found by two distinct observers to be\r\ncomparatively infertile. The two pimpernels (Anagallis arvensis and A.\r\ncoerulea), classed by most botanists as varieties of one species, have\r\nbeen found, after repeated trials, to be perfectly sterile when crossed.\r\n\r\nNo cases of this kind are recorded among animals; but this is not to be\r\nwondered at, when we consider how very few experiments have been made\r\nwith natural varieties; while there is good reason for believing that\r\ndomestic varieties are exceptionally fertile, partly because one of the\r\nconditions of domestication was fertility under changed conditions, and\r\nalso because long continued domestication is believed to have the effect\r\nof increasing fertility and eliminating whatever sterility may exist.\r\nThis is shown by the fact that, in many cases, domestic animals are\r\ndescended from two or more distinct species. This is almost certainly\r\nthe case with the dog, and probably with the hog, the ox, and the sheep;\r\nyet the various breeds are now all perfectly fertile, although we have\r\nevery reason to suppose that there would be some degree of infertility\r\nif the several aboriginal species were crossed together for the first\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parallelism between Crossing and Change of Conditions._\r\n\r\nIn the whole series of these phenomena, from the beneficial effects of\r\nthe crossing of different stocks and the evil effects of close\r\ninterbreeding, up to the partial or complete sterility induced by\r\ncrosses between species belonging to different genera, we have, as Mr.\r\nDarwin points out, a curious parallelism with the effects produced by\r\nchange of physical conditions. It is well known that slight changes in\r\nthe conditions of life are beneficial to all living things. Plants, if\r\nconstantly grown in one soil and locality from their own seeds, are\r\ngreatly benefited by the importation of seed from some other locality.\r\nThe same thing happens with animals; and the benefit we ourselves\r\nexperience from \"change of air\" is an illustration of the same\r\nphenomenon. But the amount of the change which is beneficial has its\r\nlimits, and then a greater amount is injurious. A change to a climate a\r\nfew degrees warmer or colder may be good, while a change to the tropics\r\nor to the arctic regions might be injurious.\r\n\r\nThus we see that, both slight changes of conditions and a slight amount\r\nof crossing, are beneficial; while extreme changes, and crosses between\r\nindividuals too far removed in structure or constitution, are injurious.\r\nAnd there is not only a parallelism but an actual connection between the\r\ntwo classes of facts, for, as we have already shown, many species of\r\nanimals and plants are rendered infertile, or altogether sterile, by the\r\nchange from their natural conditions which occurs in confinement or in\r\ncultivation; while, on the other hand, the increased vigour or fertility\r\nwhich is invariably produced by a judicious cross may be also effected\r\nby a judicious change of climate and surroundings. We shall see in a\r\nsubsequent chapter, that this interchangeability of the beneficial\r\neffects of crossing and of new conditions, serves to explain some very\r\npuzzling phenomena in the forms and economy of flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Remarks on the Facts of Hybridity._\r\n\r\nThe facts that have now been adduced, though not very numerous, are\r\nsufficiently conclusive to prove that the old belief, of the universal\r\nsterility of hybrids and fertility of mongrels, is incorrect. The\r\ndoctrine that such a universal law existed was never more than a\r\nplausible generalisation, founded on a few inconclusive facts derived\r\nfrom domesticated animals and cultivated plants. The facts were, and\r\nstill are, inconclusive for several reasons. They are founded,\r\nprimarily, on what occurs among animals in domestication; and it has\r\nbeen shown that domestication both tends to increase fertility, and was\r\nitself rendered possible by the fertility of those particular species\r\nbeing little affected by changed conditions. The exceptional fertility\r\nof all the varieties of domesticated animals does not prove that a\r\nsimilar fertility exists among natural varieties. In the next place, the\r\ngeneralisation is founded on too remote crosses, as in the case of the\r\nhorse and the ass, the two most distinct and widely separated species of\r\nthe genus Equus, so distinct indeed that they have been held by some\r\nnaturalists to form distinct genera. Crosses between the two species of\r\nzebra, or even between the zebra and the quagga, or the quagga and the\r\nass, might have led to a very different result. Again, in pre-Darwinian\r\ntimes it was so universally the practice to argue in a circle, and\r\ndeclare that the fertility of the offspring of a cross proved the\r\nidentity of species of the parents, that experiments in hybridity were\r\nusually made between very remote species and even between species of\r\ndifferent genera, to avoid the possibility of the reply: \"They are both\r\nreally the same species;\" and the sterility of the hybrid offspring of\r\nsuch remote crosses of course served to strengthen the popular belief.\r\n\r\nNow that we have arrived at a different standpoint, and look upon a\r\nspecies, not as a distinct entity due to special creation, but as an\r\nassemblage of individuals which have become somewhat modified in\r\nstructure, form, and constitution so as to adapt them to slightly\r\ndifferent conditions of life; which can be differentiated from other\r\nallied assemblages; which reproduce their like, and which usually breed\r\ntogether--we require a fresh set of experiments calculated to determine\r\nthe matter of fact,--whether such species crossed with their near allies\r\ndo always produce offspring which are more or less sterile _inter se_.\r\nAmple materials for such experiments exist, in the numerous\r\n\"representative species\" inhabiting distinct areas on a continent or\r\ndifferent islands of a group; or even in those found in the same area\r\nbut frequenting somewhat different stations.\r\n\r\nTo carry out these experiments with any satisfactory result, it will be\r\nnecessary to avoid the evil effects of confinement and of too close\r\ninterbreeding. If birds are experimented with, they should be allowed as\r\nmuch liberty as possible, a plot of ground with trees and bushes being\r\nenclosed with wire netting overhead so as to form a large open aviary.\r\nThe species experimented with should be obtained in considerable\r\nnumbers, and by two separate persons, each making the opposite\r\nreciprocal cross, as explained at p. 155. In the second generation these\r\ntwo stocks might be themselves crossed to prevent the evil effects of\r\ntoo close interbreeding. By such experiments, carefully carried out with\r\ndifferent groups of animals and plants, we should obtain a body of facts\r\nof a character now sadly wanting, and without which it is hopeless to\r\nexpect to arrive at a complete solution of this difficult problem. There\r\nare, however, some other aspects of the question that need to be\r\nconsidered, and some theoretical views which require to be carefully\r\nexamined, having done which we shall be in a condition to state the\r\ngeneral conclusions to which the facts and reasonings at our command\r\nseem to point.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sterility due to changed Conditions and usually correlated with other\r\nCharacters, especially with Colour._\r\n\r\nThe evidence already adduced as to the extreme susceptibility of the\r\nreproductive system, and the curious irregularity with which infertility\r\nor sterility appears in the crosses between some varieties or species\r\nwhile quite absent in those between others, seem to indicate that\r\nsterility is a characteristic which has a constant tendency to appear,\r\neither by itself or in correlation with other characters. It is known to\r\nbe especially liable to occur under changed conditions of life; and, as\r\nsuch change is usually the starting-point and cause of the development\r\nof new species, we have already found a reason why it should so often\r\nappear when species become fully differentiated.\r\n\r\nIn almost all the cases of infertility or sterility between varieties or\r\nspecies, we have some external differences with which it is correlated;\r\nand though these differences are sometimes slight, and the amount of the\r\ninfertility is not always, or even usually, proportionate to the\r\nexternal difference between the two forms crossed, we must believe that\r\nthere is some connection between the two classes of facts. This is\r\nespecially the case as regards colour; and Mr. Darwin has collected a\r\nbody of facts which go far to prove that colour, instead of being an\r\naltogether trifling and unimportant character, as was supposed by the\r\nolder naturalists, is really one of great significance, since it is\r\nundoubtedly often correlated with important constitutional differences.\r\nNow colour is one of the characters that most usually distinguishes\r\nclosely allied species; and when we hear that the most closely allied\r\nspecies of plants are infertile together, while those more remote are\r\nfertile, the meaning usually is that the former differ chiefly in the\r\n_colour_ of their flowers, while the latter differ in the form of the\r\nflowers or foliage, in habit, or in other structural characters.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore a most curious and suggestive fact, that in all the\r\nrecorded cases, in which a decided infertility occurs between varieties\r\nof the same species, those varieties are distinguished by a difference\r\nof colour. The infertile varieties of Verbascum were white and yellow\r\nflowered respectively; the infertile varieties of maize were red and\r\nyellow seeded; while the infertile pimpernels were the red and the blue\r\nflowered varieties. So, the differently coloured varieties of\r\nhollyhocks, though grown close together, each reproduce their own colour\r\nfrom seed, showing that they are not capable of freely intercrossing.\r\nYet Mr. Darwin assures us that the agency of bees is necessary to carry\r\nthe pollen from one plant to another, because in each flower the pollen\r\nis shed before the stigma is ready to receive it. We have here,\r\ntherefore, either almost complete sterility between varieties of\r\ndifferent colours, or a prepotent effect of pollen from a flower of the\r\nsame colour, bringing about the same result.\r\n\r\nSimilar phenomena have not been recorded among animals; but this is not\r\nto be wondered at when we consider that most of our pure and valued\r\ndomestic breeds are characterised by definite colours which constitute\r\none of their distinctive marks, and they are, therefore, seldom crossed\r\nwith these of another colour; and even when they are so crossed, no\r\nnotice would be taken of any slight diminution of fertility, since this\r\nis liable to occur from many causes. We have also reason to believe that\r\nfertility has been increased by long domestication, in addition to the\r\nfact of the original stocks being exceptionally fertile; and no\r\nexperiments have been made on the differently coloured varieties of wild\r\nanimals. There are, however, a number of very curious facts showing that\r\ncolour in animals, as in plants, is often correlated with constitutional\r\ndifferences of a remarkable kind, and as these have a close relation to\r\nthe subject we are discussing, a brief summary of them will be here\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Correlation of Colour with Constitutional Peculiarities._\r\n\r\nThe correlation of a white colour and blue eyes in male cats with\r\ndeafness, and of the tortoise-shell marking with the female sex of the\r\nsame animal, are two well-known but most extraordinary cases. Equally\r\nremarkable is the fact, communicated to Darwin by Mr. Tegetmeier, that\r\nwhite, yellow, pale blue, or dun pigeons, of all breeds, have the young\r\nbirds born naked, while in all other colours they are well covered with\r\ndown. Here we have a case in which colour seems of more physiological\r\nimportance than all the varied structural differences between the\r\nvarieties and breeds of pigeons. In Virginia there is a plant called the\r\npaint-root (Lachnanthes tinctoria), which, when eaten by pigs, colours\r\ntheir bones pink, and causes the hoofs of all but the black varieties to\r\ndrop off; so that black pigs only can be kept in the district.[58]\r\nBuckwheat in flower is also said to be injurious to white pigs but not\r\nto black. In the Tarentino, black sheep are not injured by eating the\r\nHypericum crispum--a species of St. John's-wort--which kills white\r\nsheep. White terriers suffer most from distemper; white chickens from\r\nthe gapes. White-haired horses or cattle are subject to cutaneous\r\ndiseases from which the dark coloured are free; while, both in Thuringia\r\nand the West Indies, it has been noticed that white or pale coloured\r\ncattle are much more troubled by flies than are those which are brown or\r\nblack. The same law even extends to insects, for it is found that\r\nsilkworms which produce white cocoons resist the fungus disease much\r\nbetter than do those which produce yellow cocoons.[59] Among plants, we\r\nhave in North America green and yellow-fruited plums not affected by a\r\ndisease that attacked the purple-fruited varieties. Yellow-fleshed\r\npeaches suffer more from disease than white-fleshed kinds. In Mauritius,\r\nwhite sugar-canes were attacked by a disease from which the red canes\r\nwere free. White onions and verbenas are most liable to mildew; and\r\nred-flowered hyacinths were more injured by the cold during a severe\r\nwinter in Holland than any other kinds.[60]\r\n\r\nThese curious and inexplicable correlations of colour with\r\nconstitutional peculiarities, both in animals and plants, render it\r\nprobable that the correlation of colour with infertility, which has been\r\ndetected in several cases in plants, may also extend to animals in a\r\nstate of nature; and if so, the fact is of the highest importance as\r\nthrowing light on the origin of the infertility of many allied species.\r\nThis will be better understood after considering the facts which will be\r\nnow described.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Isolation of Varieties by Selective Association._\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter I have shown that the importance of geographical\r\nisolation for the formation of new species by natural selection has been\r\ngreatly exaggerated, because the very change of conditions, which is\r\nthe initial power in starting such new forms, leads also to a local or\r\nstational segregation of the forms acted upon. But there is also a very\r\npowerful cause of isolation in the mental nature--the likes and\r\ndislikes--of animals; and to this is probably due the fact of the\r\ncomparative rarity of hybrids in a state of nature. The differently\r\ncoloured herds of cattle in the Falkland Islands, each of which keeps\r\nseparate, have been already mentioned; and it may be added, that the\r\nmouse-coloured variety seem to have already developed a physiological\r\npeculiarity in breeding a month earlier than the others. Similar facts\r\noccur, however, among our domestic animals and are well known to\r\nbreeders. Professor Low, one of the greatest authorities on our\r\ndomesticated animals, says: \"The female of the dog, when not under\r\nrestraint, makes selection of her mate, the mastiff selecting the\r\nmastiff, the terrier the terrier, and so on.\" And again: \"The Merino\r\nsheep and Heath sheep of Scotland, if two flocks are mixed together,\r\neach will breed with its own variety.\" Mr. Darwin has collected many\r\nfacts illustrating this point. One of the chief pigeon-fanciers in\r\nEngland informed him that, if free to choose, each breed would prefer\r\npairing with its own kind. Among the wild horses in Paraguay those of\r\nthe same colour and size associate together; while in Circassia there\r\nare three races of horses which have received special names, and which,\r\nwhen living a free life, almost always refuse to mingle and cross, and\r\nwill even attack one another. On one of the Faroe Islands, not more than\r\nhalf a mile in diameter, the half-wild native black sheep do not readily\r\nmix with imported white sheep. In the Forest of Dean, and in the New\r\nForest, the dark and pale coloured herds of fallow deer have never been\r\nknown to mingle; and even the curious Ancon sheep of quite modern origin\r\nhave been observed to keep together, separating themselves from the rest\r\nof the flock when put into enclosures with other sheep. The same rule\r\napplies to birds, for Darwin was informed by the Rev. W.D. Fox that his\r\nflocks of white and Chinese geese kept distinct.[61]\r\n\r\nThis constant preference of animals for their like, even in the case of\r\nslightly different varieties of the same species, is evidently a fact\r\nof great importance in considering the origin of species by natural\r\nselection, since it shows us that, so soon as a slight differentiation\r\nof form or colour has been effected, isolation will at once arise by the\r\nselective association of the animals themselves; and thus the great\r\nstumbling-block of \"the swamping effects of intercrossing,\" which has\r\nbeen so prominently brought forward by many naturalists, will be\r\ncompletely obviated.\r\n\r\nIf now we combine with this fact the correlation of colour with\r\nimportant constitutional peculiarities, and, in some cases, with\r\ninfertility; and consider, further, the curious parallelism that has\r\nbeen shown to exist between the effects of changed conditions and the\r\nintercrossing of varieties in producing either an increase or a decrease\r\nof fertility, we shall have obtained, at all events, a starting-point\r\nfor the production of that infertility which is so characteristic a\r\nfeature of distinct species when intercrossed. All we need, now, is some\r\nmeans of increasing or accumulating this initial tendency; and to a\r\ndiscussion of this problem we will therefore address ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Influence of Natural Selection upon Sterility and Fertility._\r\n\r\nIt will occur to many persons that, as the infertility or sterility of\r\nincipient species would be useful to them when occupying the same or\r\nadjacent areas, by neutralising the effects of intercrossing, this\r\ninfertility might have been increased by the action of natural\r\nselection; and this will be thought the more probable if we admit, as we\r\nhave seen reason to do, that variations in fertility occur, perhaps as\r\nfrequently as other variations. Mr. Darwin tells us that, at one time,\r\nthis appeared to him probable, but he found the problem to be one of\r\nextreme complexity; and he was also influenced against the view by many\r\nconsiderations which seemed to render such an origin of the sterility or\r\ninfertility of species when intercrossed very improbable. The fact that\r\nspecies which occupy distinct areas, and which nowhere come in contact\r\nwith each other, are often sterile when crossed, is one of the\r\ndifficulties; but this may perhaps be overcome by the consideration\r\nthat, though now isolated, they may, and often must, have been in\r\ncontact at their origination. More important is the objection that\r\nnatural selection could not possibly have produced the difference that\r\noften occurs between reciprocal crosses, one of these being sometimes\r\nfertile, while the other is sterile. The extremely different amounts of\r\ninfertility or sterility between different species of the same genus,\r\nthe infertility often bearing no proportion to the difference between\r\nthe species crossed, is also an important objection. But none of these\r\nobjections would have much weight if it could be clearly shown that\r\nnatural selection _is_ able to increase the infertility variations of\r\nincipient species, as it is certainly able to increase and develop all\r\nuseful variations of form, structure, instincts, or habits. Ample causes\r\nof infertility have been shown to exist, in the nature of the organism\r\nand the laws of correlation; the agency of natural selection is only\r\nneeded to accumulate the effects produced by these causes, and to render\r\ntheir final results more uniform and more in accordance with the facts\r\nthat exist.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty years ago I had much correspondence and discussion with Mr.\r\nDarwin on this question. I then believed that I was able to demonstrate\r\nthe action of natural selection in accumulating infertility; but I could\r\nnot convince him, owing to the extreme complexity of the process under\r\nthe conditions which he thought most probable. I have recently returned\r\nto the question; and, with the fuller knowledge of the facts of\r\nvariation we now possess, I think it may be shown that natural selection\r\n_is_, in some probable cases at all events, able to accumulate\r\nvariations in infertility between incipient species.\r\n\r\nThe simplest case to consider, will be that in which two forms or\r\nvarieties of a species, occupying an extensive area, are in process of\r\nadaptation to somewhat different modes of life within the same area. If\r\nthese two forms freely intercross with each other, and produce mongrel\r\noffspring which are quite fertile _inter se_, then the further\r\ndifferentiation of the forms into two distinct species will be retarded,\r\nor perhaps entirely prevented; for the offspring of the crossed unions\r\nwill be, perhaps, more vigorous on account of the cross, although less\r\nperfectly adapted to the conditions of existence than either of the pure\r\nbreeds; and this would certainly establish a powerful antagonistic\r\ninfluence to the further differentiation of the two forms.\r\n\r\nNow, let us suppose that a partial sterility of the hybrids between the\r\ntwo forms arises, in correlation with the different modes of life and\r\nthe slight external or internal peculiarities that exist between them,\r\nboth of which we have seen to be real causes of infertility. The result\r\nwill be that, even if the hybrids between the two forms are still freely\r\nproduced, these hybrids will not themselves increase so rapidly as the\r\ntwo pure forms; and as these latter are, by the terms of the problem,\r\nbetter suited to their conditions of life than are the hybrids between\r\nthem, they will not only increase more rapidly, but will also tend to\r\nsupplant the hybrids altogether whenever the struggle for existence\r\nbecomes exceptionally severe. Thus, the more complete the sterility of\r\nthe hybrids the more rapidly will they die out and leave the two parent\r\nforms pure. Hence it will follow that, if there is greater infertility\r\nbetween the two forms in one part of the area than the other, these\r\nforms will be kept more pure wherever this greater infertility prevails,\r\nwill therefore have an advantage at each recurring period of severe\r\nstruggle for existence, and will thus ultimately supplant the less\r\ninfertile or completely fertile forms that may exist in other portions\r\nof the area. It thus appears that, in such a case as here supposed,\r\nnatural selection would preserve those portions of the two breeds which\r\nwere most infertile with each other, or whose hybrid offspring were most\r\ninfertile; and would, therefore, if variations in fertility continued to\r\narise, tend to increase that infertility. It must particularly be noted\r\nthat this effect would result, not by the preservation of the infertile\r\nvariations on account of their infertility, but by the inferiority of\r\nthe hybrid offspring, both as being fewer in numbers, less able to\r\ncontinue their race, and less adapted to the conditions of existence\r\nthan either of the pure forms. It is this inferiority of the hybrid\r\noffspring that is the essential point; and as the number of these\r\nhybrids will be permanently less where the infertility is greatest,\r\ntherefore those portions of the two forms in which infertility is\r\ngreatest will have the advantage, and will ultimately survive in the\r\nstruggle for existence.\r\n\r\nThe differentiation of the two forms into distinct species, with the\r\nincrease of infertility between them, would be greatly assisted by two\r\nother important factors in the problem. It has already been shown that,\r\nwith each modification of form and habits, and especially with\r\nmodifications of colour, there arises a disinclination of the two forms\r\nto pair together; and this would produce an amount of isolation which\r\nwould greatly assist the specialisation of the forms in adaptation to\r\ntheir different conditions of life. Again, evidence has been adduced\r\nthat change of conditions or of mode of life is a potent cause of\r\ndisturbance of the reproductive system, and, consequently, of\r\ninfertility. We may therefore assume that, as the two forms adopted more\r\nand more different modes of life, and perhaps acquired also decided\r\npeculiarities of form and coloration, the infertility between them would\r\nincrease or become more general; and as we have seen that every such\r\nincrease of infertility would give that portion of the species in which\r\nit arose an advantage over the remaining portions in which the two\r\nvarieties were more fertile together, all this induced infertility would\r\nmaintain itself, and still further increase the general infertility\r\nbetween the two forms of the species.\r\n\r\nIt follows, then, that specialisation to separate conditions of life,\r\ndifferentiation of external characters, disinclination to cross-unions,\r\nand the infertility of the hybrid produce of these unions, would all\r\nproceed _pari passu_, and would ultimately lead to the production of two\r\ndistinct forms having all the characteristics, physiological as well as\r\nstructural, of true species.\r\n\r\nIn the case now discussed it has been supposed, that some amount of\r\ngeneral infertility might arise in correlation with the different modes\r\nof life of two varieties or incipient species. A considerable body of\r\nfacts already adduced renders it probable that this _is_ the mode in\r\nwhich any widespread infertility would arise; and, if so, it has been\r\nshown that, by the influence of natural selection and the known laws\r\nwhich affect varieties, the infertility would be gradually increased.\r\nBut, if we suppose the infertility to arise sporadically within the two\r\nforms, and to affect only a small proportion of the individuals in any\r\narea, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to show that such\r\ninfertility would have any tendency to increase, or would produce any\r\nbut a prejudicial effect. If, for example, five per cent of each form\r\nthus varied so as to be infertile with the other form, the result would\r\nbe hardly perceptible, because the individuals which formed cross-unions\r\nand produced hybrids would constitute a very small portion of the whole\r\nspecies; and the hybrid offspring, being at a disadvantage in the\r\nstruggle for existence and being themselves infertile, would soon die\r\nout, while the much more numerous fertile portion of the two forms would\r\nincrease rapidly, and furnish a sufficient number of pure-bred offspring\r\nof each form to take the place of the somewhat inferior hybrids between\r\nthem whenever the struggle for existence became severe. We must suppose\r\nthat the normal fertile forms would transmit their fertility to their\r\nprogeny, and the few infertile forms their infertility; but the latter\r\nwould necessarily lose half their proper increase by the sterility of\r\ntheir hybrid offspring whenever they crossed with the other form, and\r\nwhen they bred with their own form the tendency to sterility would die\r\nout except in the very minute proportion of the five per cent\r\n(one-twentieth) that chance would lead to pair together. Under these\r\ncircumstances the incipient sterility between the two forms would\r\nrapidly be eliminated, and could never rise much above the numbers which\r\nwere produced by sporadic variation each year.\r\n\r\nIt was, probably, by a consideration of some such case as this that Mr.\r\nDarwin came to the conclusion that infertility arising between incipient\r\nspecies could not be increased by natural selection; and this is the\r\nmore likely, as he was always disposed to minimise both the frequency\r\nand the amount even of structural variations.\r\n\r\nWe have yet to notice another mode of action of natural selection in\r\nfavouring and perpetuating any infertility that may arise between two\r\nincipient species. If several distinct species are undergoing\r\nmodification at the same time and in the same area, to adapt them to\r\nsome new conditions that have arisen there, then any species in which\r\nthe structural or colour differences that have arisen between it and its\r\nvarieties or close allies were correlated with infertility of the\r\ncrosses between them, would have an advantage over the corresponding\r\nvarieties of other species in which there was no such physiological\r\npeculiarity. Thus, incipient species which were infertile together would\r\nhave an advantage over other incipient species which were fertile, and,\r\nwhenever the struggle for existence became severe, would prevail over\r\nthem and take their place. Such infertility, being correlated with\r\nconstitutional or structural differences, would probably, as already\r\nsuggested, go on increasing as these differences increased; and thus, by\r\nthe time the new species became fully differentiated from its parent\r\nform (or brother variety) the infertility might have become as well\r\nmarked as we usually find it to be between distinct species.\r\n\r\nThis discussion has led us to some conclusions of the greatest\r\nimportance as bearing on the difficult problem of the cause of the\r\nsterility of the hybrids between distinct species. Accepting, as highly\r\nprobable, the fact of variations in fertility occurring in correlation\r\nwith variations in habits, colour, or structure, we see, that so long as\r\nsuch variations occurred only sporadically, and affected but a small\r\nproportion of the individuals in any area, the infertility could not be\r\nincreased by natural selection, but would tend to die out almost as fast\r\nas it was produced. If, however, it was so closely correlated with\r\nphysical variations or diverse modes of life as to affect, even in a\r\nsmall degree, a considerable proportion of the individuals of the two\r\nforms in definite areas, it would be preserved by natural selection, and\r\nthe portion of the varying species thus affected would increase at the\r\nexpense of those portions which were more fertile when crossed. Each\r\nfurther variation towards infertility between the two forms would be\r\nagain preserved, and thus the incipient infertility of the hybrid\r\noffspring might be increased till it became so great as almost to amount\r\nto sterility. Yet further, we have seen that if several competing\r\nspecies in the same area were being simultaneously modified, those\r\nbetween whose varieties infertility arose would have an advantage over\r\nthose whose varieties remained fertile _inter se_, and would ultimately\r\nsupplant them.\r\n\r\nThe preceding argument, it will be seen, depends entirely upon the\r\nassumption that some amount of infertility characterises the distinct\r\nvarieties which are in process of differentiation into species; and it\r\nmay be objected that of such infertility there is no proof. This is\r\nadmitted; but it is urged that facts have been adduced which render such\r\ninfertility probable, at least in some cases, and this is all that is\r\nrequired. It is by no means necessary that _all_ varieties should\r\nexhibit incipient infertility, but only, some varieties; for we know\r\nthat, of the innumerable varieties that occur but few become developed\r\ninto distinct species, and it may be that the absence of infertility, to\r\nobviate the effects of intercrossing, is one of the usual causes of\r\ntheir failure. All I have attempted to show is, that _when_ incipient\r\ninfertility does occur in correlation with other varietal differences,\r\nthat infertility can be, and in fact must be, increased by natural\r\nselection; and this, it appears to me, is a decided step in advance in\r\nthe solution of the problem.[62]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Physiological Selection._\r\n\r\nAnother form of infertility has been suggested by Professor G.J. Romanes\r\nas having aided in bringing about the characteristic infertility or\r\nsterility of hybrids. It is founded on the fact, already noticed, that\r\ncertain individuals of some species possess what may be termed selective\r\nsterility--that is, while fertile with some individuals of the species\r\nthey are sterile with others, and this altogether independently of any\r\ndifferences of form, colour, or structure. The phenomenon, in the only\r\nform in which it has been observed, is that of \"infertility or absolute\r\nsterility between two individuals, each of which is perfectly fertile\r\nwith all other individuals;\" but Mr. Romanes thinks that \"it would not\r\nbe nearly so remarkable, or physiologically improbable, that such\r\nincompatibility should run through a whole race or strain.\"[63]\r\nAdmitting that this may be so, though we have at present no evidence\r\nwhatever in support of it, it remains to be considered whether such\r\nphysiological varieties could maintain themselves, or whether, as in the\r\ncases of sporadic infertility already discussed, they would necessarily\r\ndie out unless correlated with useful characters. Mr. Romanes thinks\r\nthat they would persist, and urges that \"whenever this one kind of\r\nvariation occurs _it cannot escape the preserving agency_ of\r\nphysiological selection. Hence, even if it be granted that the variation\r\nwhich affects the reproductive system in this particular way is a\r\nvariation of comparatively rare occurrence, still, as _it must always be\r\npreserved_ whenever it does occur, its influence in the manufacture of\r\nspecific types _must be cumulative_.\" The very positive statements which\r\nI have italicised would lead most readers to believe that the alleged\r\nfact had been demonstrated by a careful working out of the process in\r\nsome definite supposed cases. This, however, has nowhere been done in\r\nMr. Romanes' paper; and as it is _the_ vital theoretical point on which\r\nany possible value of the new theory rests, and as it appears so opposed\r\nto the self-destructive effects of simple infertility, which we have\r\nalready demonstrated when it occurs between the intermingled portion of\r\ntwo varieties, it must be carefully examined. In doing so, I will\r\nsuppose that the required variation is not of \"rare occurrence,\" but of\r\nconsiderable amount, and that it appears afresh each year to about the\r\nsame extent, thus giving the theory every possible advantage.\r\n\r\nLet us then suppose that a given species consists of 100,000 individuals\r\nof each sex, with only the usual amount of fluctuating external\r\nvariability. Let a physiological variation arise, so that 10 per cent of\r\nthe whole number--10,000 individuals of each sex--while remaining\r\nfertile _inter se_ become quite sterile with the remaining 90,000. This\r\npeculiarity is not correlated with any external differences of form or\r\ncolour, or with inherent peculiarities of likes or dislikes leading to\r\nany choice as to the pairing of the two sets of individuals. We have now\r\nto inquire, What would be the result?\r\n\r\nTaking, first, the 10,000 pairs of the physiological or abnormal\r\nvariety, we find that each male of these might pair with any one of the\r\nwhole 100,000 of the opposite sex. If, therefore, there was nothing to\r\nlimit their choice to particular individuals of either variety, the\r\nprobabilities are that 9000 of them would pair with the opposite\r\nvariety, and only 1000 with their own variety--that is, that 9000 would\r\nform sterile unions, and only _one_ thousand would form fertile unions.\r\n\r\nTaking, next, the 90,000 normal individuals of either sex, we find, that\r\neach male of these has also a choice of 100,000 to pair with. The\r\nprobabilities are, therefore, that nine-tenths of them--that is,\r\n81,000--would pair with their normal fellows, while 9000 would pair with\r\nthe opposite abnormal variety forming the above-mentioned sterile\r\nunions.\r\n\r\nNow, as the number of individuals forming a species remains constant,\r\ngenerally speaking, from year to year, we shall have next year also\r\n100,000 pairs, of which the two physiological varieties will be in the\r\nproportion of eighty-one to one, or 98,780 pairs of the normal variety\r\nto 1220[64] of the abnormal, that being the proportion of the fertile\r\nunions of each. In this year we shall find, by the same rule of\r\nprobabilities, that only 15 males of the abnormal variety will pair with\r\ntheir like and be fertile, the remaining 1205 forming sterile unions\r\nwith some of the normal variety. The following year the total 100,000\r\npairs will consist of 99,984 of the normal, and only 16 of the abnormal\r\nvariety; and the probabilities, of course, are, that the whole of these\r\nlatter will pair with some of the enormous preponderance of normal\r\nindividuals, and, their unions being sterile, the physiological variety\r\nwill become extinct in the third year.\r\n\r\nIf now in the second and each succeeding year a similar proportion as at\r\nfirst (10 per cent) of the physiological variety is produced afresh from\r\nthe ranks of the normal variety, the same rate of diminution will go on,\r\nand it will be found that, on the most favourable estimate, the\r\nphysiological variety can never exceed 12,000 to the 88,000 of the\r\nnormal form of the species, as shown by the following table:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    1st Year. 10,000 of physiological variety to 90,000 of normal variety.\r\n    2d   \"     1,220 + 10,000 again produced.\r\n    3d   \"        16 +  1,220 + 10,000 do.               = 11,236\r\n    4th  \"         O +     16 +  1,220 + 10,000 do.      = 11,236\r\n    5th  \"                  O +     16 +  1,220 + 10,000 = 11,236\r\n    and so on for any number of generations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding discussion we have given the theory the advantage of\r\nthe large proportion of 10 per cent of this very exceptional variety\r\narising in its midst year by year, and we have seen that, even under\r\nthese favourable conditions, it is unable to increase its numbers much\r\nabove its starting-point, and that it remains wholly dependent on the\r\ncontinued renewal of the variety for its existence beyond a few years.\r\nIt appears, then, that this form of inter-specific sterility cannot be\r\nincreased by natural or any other known form of selection, but that it\r\ncontains within itself its own principle of destruction. If it is\r\nproposed to get over the difficulty by postulating a larger percentage\r\nof the variety annually arising within the species, we shall not affect\r\nthe law of decrease until we approach equality in the numbers of the two\r\nvarieties. But with any such increase of the physiological variety the\r\nspecies itself would inevitably suffer by the large proportion of\r\nsterile unions in its midst, and would thus be at a great disadvantage\r\nin competition with other species which were fertile throughout. Thus,\r\nnatural selection will always tend to weed out any species with too\r\ngreat a tendency to sterility among its own members, and will therefore\r\nprevent such sterility from becoming the general characteristic of\r\nvarying species, which this theory demands should be the case.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, it appears clear that no form of infertility or\r\nsterility between the individuals of a species, can be increased by\r\nnatural selection unless correlated with some useful variation, while\r\nall infertility not so correlated has a constant tendency to effect its\r\nown elimination. But the opposite property, fertility, is of vital\r\nimportance to every species, and gives the offspring of the individuals\r\nwhich possess it, in consequence of their superior numbers, a greater\r\nchance of survival in the battle of life. It is, therefore, directly\r\nunder the control of natural selection, which acts both by the\r\nself-preservation of fertile and the self-destruction of infertile\r\nstocks--except always where correlated as above, when they become\r\nuseful, and therefore subject to be increased by natural selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Summary and Concluding Remarks on Hybridity._\r\n\r\nThe facts which are of the greatest importance to a comprehension of\r\nthis very difficult subject are those which show the extreme\r\nsusceptibility of the reproductive system both in plants and animals. We\r\nhave seen how both these classes of organisms may be rendered infertile,\r\nby a change of conditions which does not affect their general health, by\r\ncaptivity, or by too close interbreeding. We have seen, also, that\r\ninfertility is frequently correlated with a difference of colour, or\r\nwith other characters; that it is not proportionate to divergence of\r\nstructure; that it varies in reciprocal crosses between pairs of the\r\nsame species; while in the cases of dimorphic and trimorphic plants the\r\ndifferent crosses between the same pair of individuals may be fertile or\r\nsterile at the same time. It appears as if fertility depended on such a\r\ndelicate adjustment of the male and female elements to each other, that,\r\nunless constantly kept up by the preservation of the most fertile\r\nindividuals, sterility is always liable to arise. This preservation\r\nalways occurs within the limits of each species, both because fertility\r\nis of the highest importance to the continuance of the race, and also\r\nbecause sterility (and to a less extent infertility) is self-destructive\r\nas well as injurious to the species.\r\n\r\nSo long therefore as a species remains undivided, and in occupation of a\r\ncontinuous area, its fertility is kept up by natural selection; but the\r\nmoment it becomes separated, either by geographical or selective\r\nisolation, or by diversity of station or of habits, then, while each\r\nportion must be kept fertile _inter se_, there is nothing to prevent\r\ninfertility arising between the two separated portions. As the two\r\nportions will necessarily exist under somewhat different conditions of\r\nlife, and will usually have acquired some diversity of form and\r\ncolour--both which circumstances we know to be either the cause of\r\ninfertility or to be correlated with it,--the fact of some degree of\r\ninfertility usually appearing between closely allied but locally or\r\nphysiologically segregated species is exactly what we should expect.\r\n\r\nThe reason why varieties do not usually exhibit a similar amount of\r\ninfertility is not difficult to explain. The popular conclusions on this\r\nmatter have been drawn chiefly from what occurs among domestic animals,\r\nand we have seen that the very first essential to their becoming\r\ndomesticated was that they should continue fertile under changed\r\nconditions of life. During the slow process of the formation of new\r\nvarieties by conscious or unconscious selection, fertility has always\r\nbeen an essential character, and has thus been invariably preserved or\r\nincreased; while there is some evidence to show that domestication\r\nitself tends to increase fertility.\r\n\r\nAmong plants, wild species and varieties have been more frequently\r\nexperimented on than among animals, and we accordingly find numerous\r\ncases in which distinct species of plants are perfectly fertile when\r\ncrossed, their hybrid offspring being also fertile _inter se_. We also\r\nfind some few examples of the converse fact--varieties of the same\r\nspecies which when crossed are infertile or even sterile.\r\n\r\nThe idea that either infertility or geographical isolation is absolutely\r\nessential to the formation of new species, in order to prevent the\r\nswamping effects of intercrossing, has been shown to be unsound, because\r\nthe varieties or incipient species will, in most cases, be sufficiently\r\nisolated by having adopted different habits or by frequenting different\r\nstations; while selective association, which is known to be general\r\namong distinct varieties or breeds of the same species, will produce an\r\neffective isolation even when the two forms occupy the same area.\r\n\r\nFrom the various considerations now adverted to, Mr. Darwin arrived at\r\nthe conclusion that the sterility or infertility of species with each\r\nother, whether manifested in the difficulty of obtaining first crosses\r\nbetween them or in the sterility of the hybrids thus obtained, is not a\r\nconstant or necessary result of specific difference, but is incidental\r\non unknown peculiarities of the reproductive system. These peculiarities\r\nconstantly tend to arise under changed conditions owing to the extreme\r\nsusceptibility of that system, and they are usually correlated with\r\nvariations of form or of colour. Hence, as fixed differences of form and\r\ncolour, slowly gained by natural selection in adaptation to changed\r\nconditions, are what essentially characterise distinct species, some\r\namount of infertility between species is the usual result.\r\n\r\nHere the problem was left by Mr. Darwin; but we have shown that its\r\nsolution may be carried a step further. If we accept the association of\r\nsome degree of infertility, however slight, as a not unfrequent\r\naccompaniment of the external differences which always arise in a state\r\nof nature between varieties and incipient species, it has been shown\r\nthat natural selection _has_ power to increase that infertility just as\r\nit has power to increase other favourable variations. Such an increase\r\nof infertility will be beneficial, whenever new species arise in the\r\nsame area with the parent form; and we thus see how, out of the\r\nfluctuating and very unequal amounts of infertility correlated with\r\nphysical variations, there may have arisen that larger and more constant\r\namount which appears usually to characterise well-marked species.\r\n\r\nThe great body of facts of which a condensed account has been given in\r\nthe present chapter, although from an experimental point of view very\r\ninsufficient, all point to the general conclusion we have now reached,\r\nand afford us a not unsatisfactory solution of the great problem of\r\nhybridism in relation to the origin of species by means of natural\r\nselection. Further experimental research is needed in order to complete\r\nthe elucidation of the subject; but until these additional facts are\r\nforthcoming no new theory seems required for the explanation of the\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: Darwin's _Animals and Plants under Domestication_, vol.\r\nii. pp. 163-170.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: For a full account of these interesting facts and of the\r\nvarious problems to which they give rise, the reader must consult\r\nDarwin's volume on _The Different Forms of Flowers in Plants of the same\r\nSpecies_, chaps, i.-iv.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: See _Nature_, vol. xxi. p. 207.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: Low's _Domesticated Animals of Great Britain_,\r\nIntroduction, p. lxiv.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: Low's _Domesticated Animals_, p. 28.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: _Amaryllidaceae_, by the Hon. and Rev.

He\r\nstates that a dark pigment in the olfactory region of the nostrils is\r\nessential to perfect smell, and that this pigment is rarely deficient\r\nexcept when the whole animal is pure white, and the creature is then\r\nalmost without smell or taste. He observes that there is no proof that,\r\nin any of the cases given above, the black animals actually eat the\r\npoisonous root or plant; and that the facts are readily understood if\r\nthe senses of smell and taste are dependent on a pigment which is absent\r\nin the white animals, who therefore eat what those gifted with normal\r\nsenses avoid. This explanation however hardly seems to cover the facts.\r\nWe cannot suppose that almost all the sheep in the world (which are\r\nmostly white) are without smell or taste. The cutaneous disease on the\r\nwhite patches of hair on horses, the special liability of white terriers\r\nto distemper, of white chickens to the gapes, and of silkworms which\r\nproduce yellow silk to the fungus, are not explained by it. The\r\nanalogous facts in plants also indicate a real constitutional relation\r\nwith colour, not an affection of the sense of smell and taste only.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: For all these facts, see _Animals and Plants under\r\nDomestication_, vol. ii. pp. 335-338.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: _Animals and Plants under Domestication_, vol. ii. pp.\r\n102, 103.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: As this argument is a rather difficult one to follow,\r\nwhile its theoretical importance is very great, I add here the following\r\nbriefer exposition of it, in a series of propositions; being, with a few\r\nverbal alterations, a copy of what I wrote on the subject about twenty\r\nyears back. Some readers may find this easier to follow than the fuller\r\ndiscussion in the text:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Can Sterility of Hybrids have been Produced by Natural\r\n    Selection?_\r\n\r\n    1. Let there be a species which has varied into _two forms_ each\r\n    adapted to certain existing conditions better than the parent\r\n    form, which they soon supplant.\r\n\r\n    2. If these _two forms_, which are supposed to coexist in the\r\n    same district, do not intercross, natural selection will\r\n    accumulate all favourable variations till they become well\r\n    suited to their conditions of life, and form two slightly\r\n    differing species.\r\n\r\n    3. But if these _two forms_ freely intercross with each other,\r\n    and produce hybrids, which are also quite fertile _inter se_,\r\n    then the formation of the two distinct races or species will be\r\n    retarded, or perhaps entirely prevented; for the offspring of\r\n    the crossed unions will be _more vigorous_ owing to the cross,\r\n    although _less adapted_ to their conditions of life than either\r\n    of the pure breeds.\r\n\r\n    4. Now, let a partial sterility of the hybrids of some\r\n    considerable proportion of these two forms arise; and, as this\r\n    would probably be due to some special conditions of life, we may\r\n    fairly suppose it to arise in some definite portion of the area\r\n    occupied by the two forms.\r\n\r\n    5. The result will be that, in that area, the hybrids (although\r\n    continually produced by first crosses almost as freely as\r\n    before) will not themselves increase so rapidly as the two pure\r\n    forms; and as the two pure forms are, by the terms of the\r\n    problem, better suited to their several conditions of life than\r\n    the hybrids, they will inevitably increase more rapidly, and\r\n    will continually tend to supplant the hybrids altogether at\r\n    every recurrent severe struggle for existence.\r\n\r\n    6. We may fairly suppose, also, that as soon as any sterility\r\n    appears some disinclination to _cross unions_ will appear, and\r\n    this will further tend to the diminution of the production of\r\n    hybrids.\r\n\r\n    7. In the other part of the area, however, where hybridism\r\n    occurs with perfect freedom, hybrids of various degrees may\r\n    increase till they equal or even exceed in number the pure\r\n    species--that is, the incipient species will be liable to be\r\n    swamped by intercrossing.\r\n\r\n    8. The first result, then, of a partial sterility of crosses\r\n    appearing in one part of the area occupied by the two forms,\r\n    will be--that the great majority of the individuals will there\r\n    consist of the two pure forms only, while in the remaining part\r\n    these will be in a minority,--which is the same as saying that\r\n    the new _physiological variety_ of the two forms will be better\r\n    suited to the conditions of existence than the remaining portion\r\n    which has not varied physiologically.\r\n\r\n    9. But when the struggle for existence becomes severe, that\r\n    variety which is best adapted to the conditions of existence\r\n    always supplants that which is imperfectly adapted; therefore,\r\n    _by natural selection_ the _varieties_ which are _sterile_ when\r\n    crossed will become established as the only ones.\r\n\r\n    10. Now let variations in the _amount of sterility_ and in\r\n    the _disinclination to crossed unions_ continue to occur--also\r\n    in certain parts of the area: exactly the same result must\r\n    recur, and the progeny of this new physiological variety will in\r\n    time occupy the whole area.\r\n\r\n    11. There is yet another consideration that would facilitate the\r\n    process. It seems probable that the _sterility variations_\r\n    would, to some extent, concur with, and perhaps depend upon, the\r\n    _specific variations_; so that, just in proportion as the _two\r\n    forms_ diverged and became better adapted to the conditions of\r\n    existence, they would become more sterile when intercrossed. If\r\n    this were the case, then natural selection would act with double\r\n    strength; and those which were better adapted to survive both\r\n    structurally and physiologically would certainly do so.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: Cases of this kind are referred to at p. 155. It must,\r\nhowever, be noted, that such sterility in first crosses appears to be\r\nequally rare between different species of the same genus as between\r\nindividuals of the same species. Mules and other hybrids are freely\r\nproduced between very distinct species, but are themselves infertile or\r\nquite sterile; and it is this infertility or sterility of the hybrids\r\nthat is the characteristic--and was once thought to be the criterion--of\r\nspecies, not the sterility of their first crosses. Hence we should not\r\nexpect to find any constant infertility in the first crosses between the\r\ndistinct strains or varieties that formed the starting-point of new\r\nspecies, but only a slight amount of infertility in their mongrel\r\noffspring. It follows, that Mr. Romanes' theory of _Physiological\r\nSelection_--which assumes sterility or infertility between first crosses\r\nas the fundamental fact in the origin of species--does not accord with\r\nthe general phenomena of hybridism in nature.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: The exact number is 1219.51, but the fractions are omitted\r\nfor clearness.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN AND USES OF COLOUR IN ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Darwinian theory threw new light on organic colour--The\r\n    problem to be solved--The constancy of animal colour indicates\r\n    utility--Colour and environment--Arctic animals\r\n    white--Exceptions prove the rule--Desert, forest, nocturnal, and\r\n    oceanic animals--General theories of animal colour--Variable\r\n    protective colouring--Mr. Poulton's experiments--Special or\r\n    local colour adaptations--Imitation of particular objects--How\r\n    they have been produced--Special protective colouring of\r\n    butterflies--Protective resemblance among marine\r\n    animals--Protection by terrifying enemies--Alluring\r\n    coloration--The coloration of birds' eggs--Colour as a means of\r\n    recognition--Summary of the preceding exposition--Influence of\r\n    locality or of climate on colour--Concluding remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous applications of the Darwinian theory in the\r\ninterpretation of the complex phenomena presented by the organic world,\r\nnone have been more successful, or are more interesting, than those\r\nwhich deal with the colours of animals and plants. To the older school\r\nof naturalists colour was a trivial character, eminently unstable and\r\nuntrustworthy in the determination of species; and it appeared to have,\r\nin most cases, no use or meaning to the objects which displayed it. The\r\nbright and often gorgeous coloration of insect, bird, or flower, was\r\neither looked upon as having been created for the enjoyment of mankind,\r\nor as due to unknown and perhaps undiscoverable laws of nature.\r\n\r\nBut the researches of Mr. Darwin totally changed our point of view in\r\nthis matter. He showed, clearly, that some of the colours of animals are\r\nuseful, some hurtful to them; and he believed that many of the most\r\nbrilliant colours were developed by sexual choice; while his great\r\ngeneral principle, that all the fixed characters of organic beings have\r\nbeen developed under the action of the law of utility, led to the\r\ninevitable conclusion that so remarkable and conspicuous a character as\r\ncolour, which so often constitutes the most obvious distinction of\r\nspecies from species, or group from group, must also have arisen from\r\nsurvival of the fittest, and must, therefore, in most cases have some\r\nrelation to the wellbeing of its possessors. Continuous observation and\r\nresearch, carried on by multitudes of observers during the last thirty\r\nyears, have shown this to be the case; but the problem is found to be\r\nfar more complex than was at first supposed. The modes in which colour\r\nis of use to different classes of organisms is very varied, and have\r\nprobably not yet been all discovered; while the infinite variety and\r\nmarvellous beauty of some of its developments are such as to render it\r\nhopeless to arrive at a complete and satisfactory explanation of every\r\nindividual case. So much, however, has been achieved, so many curious\r\nfacts have been explained, and so much light has been thrown on some of\r\nthe most obscure phenomena of nature, that the subject deserves a\r\nprominent place in any account of the Darwinian theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Problem to be Solved._\r\n\r\nBefore dealing with the various modifications of colour in the animal\r\nworld it is necessary to say a few words on colour in general, on its\r\nprevalence in nature, and how it is that the colours of animals and\r\nplants require any special explanation. What we term colour is a\r\nsubjective phenomenon, due to the constitution of our mind and nervous\r\nsystem; while, objectively, it consists of light-vibrations of different\r\nwave-lengths emitted by, or reflected from, various objects. Every\r\nvisible object must be coloured, because to be visible it must send rays\r\nof light to our eye. The kind of light it sends is modified by the\r\nmolecular constitution or the surface texture of the object. Pigments\r\nabsorb certain rays and reflect the remainder, and this reflected\r\nportion has to our eyes a definite colour, according to the portion of\r\nthe rays constituting white light which are absorbed. Interference\r\ncolours are produced either by thin films or by very fine striae on the\r\nsurfaces of bodies, which cause rays of certain wave-lengths to\r\nneutralise each other, leaving the remainder to produce the effects of\r\ncolour. Such are the colours of soap-bubbles, or of steel or glass on\r\nwhich extremely fine lines have been ruled; and these colours often\r\nproduce the effect of metallic lustre, and are the cause of most of the\r\nmetallic hues of birds and insects.\r\n\r\nAs colour thus depends on molecular or chemical constitution or on the\r\nminute surface texture of bodies, and, as the matter of which organic\r\nbeings are composed consists of chemical compounds of great complexity\r\nand extreme instability, and is also subject to innumerable changes\r\nduring growth and development, we might naturally expect the phenomena\r\nof colour to be more varied here than in less complex and more stable\r\ncompounds. Yet even in the inorganic world we find abundant and varied\r\ncolours; in the earth and in the water; in metals, gems, and minerals;\r\nin the sky and in the ocean; in sunset clouds and in the many-tinted\r\nrainbow. Here we can have no question of _use_ to the coloured object,\r\nand almost as little perhaps in the vivid red of blood, in the brilliant\r\ncolours of red snow and other low algae and fungi, or even in the\r\nuniversal mantle of green which clothes so large a portion of the\r\nearth's surface. The presence of some colour, or even of many brilliant\r\ncolours, in animals and plants would require no other explanation than\r\ndoes that of the sky or the ocean, of the ruby or the emerald--that is,\r\nit would require a purely physical explanation only. It is the wonderful\r\nindividuality of the colours of animals and plants that attracts our\r\nattention--the fact that the colours are localised in definite patterns,\r\nsometimes in accordance with structural characters, sometimes altogether\r\nindependent of them; while often differing in the most striking and\r\nfantastic manner in allied species. We are thus compelled to look upon\r\ncolour not merely as a physical but also as a biological characteristic,\r\nwhich has been differentiated and specialised by natural selection, and\r\nmust, therefore, find its explanation in the principle of adaptation or\r\nutility.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Constancy of Animal Colour indicates Utility._\r\n\r\nThat the colours and markings of animals have been acquired under the\r\nfundamental law of utility is indicated by a general fact which has\r\nreceived very little attention. As a rule, colour and marking are\r\nconstant in each species of wild animal, while, in almost every\r\ndomesticated animal, there arises great variability. We see this in our\r\nhorses and cattle, our dogs and cats, our pigeons and poultry. Now, the\r\nessential difference between the conditions of life of domesticated and\r\nwild animals is, that the former are protected by man, while the latter\r\nhave to protect themselves. The extreme variations in colour that\r\nimmediately arise under domestication indicate a tendency to vary in\r\nthis way, and the occasional occurrence of white or piebald or other\r\nexceptionally coloured individuals of many species in a state of nature,\r\nshows that this tendency exists there also; and, as these exceptionally\r\ncoloured individuals rarely or never increase, there must be some\r\nconstant power at work to keep it in check. This power can only be\r\nnatural selection or the survival of the fittest, which again implies\r\nthat some colours are useful, some injurious, in each particular case.\r\nWith this principle as our guide, let us see how far we can account both\r\nfor the general and special colours of the animal world.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Colour and Environment._\r\n\r\nThe fact that first strikes us in our examination of the colours of\r\nanimals as a whole, is the close relation that exists between these\r\ncolours and the general environment. Thus, white prevails among arctic\r\nanimals; yellow or brown in desert species; while green is only a common\r\ncolour in tropical evergreen forests. If we consider these cases\r\nsomewhat carefully we shall find, that they afford us excellent\r\nmaterials for forming a judgment on the various theories that have been\r\nsuggested to account for the colours of the animal world.\r\n\r\nIn the arctic regions there are a number of animals which are wholly\r\nwhite all the year round, or which only turn white in winter. Among the\r\nformer are the polar bear and the American polar hare, the snowy owl and\r\nthe Greenland falcon; among the latter the arctic fox, the arctic hare,\r\nthe ermine, and the ptarmigan. Those which are permanently white remain\r\namong the snow nearly all the year round, while those which change their\r\ncolour inhabit regions which are free from snow in summer. The obvious\r\nexplanation of this style of coloration is, that it is protective,\r\nserving to conceal the herbivorous species from their enemies, and\r\nenabling carnivorous animals to approach their prey unperceived. Two\r\nother explanations have, however, been suggested. One is, that the\r\nprevalent white of the arctic regions has a direct effect in producing\r\nthe white colour in animals, either by some photographic or chemical\r\naction on the skin or by a reflex action through vision. The other is,\r\nthat the white colour is chiefly beneficial as a means of checking\r\nradiation and so preserving animal heat during the severity of an arctic\r\nwinter. The first is part of the general theory that colour is the\r\neffect of coloured light on the objects--a pure hypothesis which has, I\r\nbelieve, no facts whatever to support it. The second suggestion is also\r\nan hypothesis merely, since it has not been proved by experiment that a\r\nwhite colour, _per se_, independently of the fur or feathers which is so\r\ncoloured, has any effect whatever in checking the radiation of low-grade\r\nheat like that of the animal body. But both alike are sufficiently\r\ndisproved by the interesting exceptions to the rule of white coloration\r\nin the arctic regions, which exceptions are, nevertheless, quite in\r\nharmony with the theory of protection.\r\n\r\nWhenever we find arctic animals which, from whatever cause, do not\r\nrequire protection by the white colour, then neither the cold nor the\r\nsnow-glare has any effect upon their coloration. The sable retains its\r\nrich brown fur throughout the Siberian winter; but it frequents trees at\r\nthat season and not only feeds partially on fruits or seeds, but is able\r\nto catch birds among the branches of the fir-trees, with the bark of\r\nwhich its colour assimilates. Then we have that thoroughly arctic\r\nanimal, the musk-sheep, which is brown and conspicuous; but this animal\r\nis gregarious, and its safety depends on its association in small herds.\r\nIt is, therefore, of more importance for it to be able to recognise its\r\nkind at a distance than to be concealed from its enemies, against which\r\nit can well protect itself so long as it keeps together in a compact\r\nbody. But the most striking example is that of the common raven, which\r\nis a true arctic bird, and is found even in mid-winter as far north as\r\nany known bird or mammal. Yet it always retains its black coat, and the\r\nreason, from our point of view, is obvious. The raven is a powerful bird\r\nand fears no enemy, while, being a carrion-feeder, it has no need for\r\nconcealment in order to approach its prey. The colour of the raven and\r\nof the musk-sheep are, therefore, both inconsistent with any other\r\ntheory than that the white colour of arctic animals has been acquired\r\nfor concealment, and to that theory both afford a strong support. Here\r\nwe have a striking example of the exception proving the rule.\r\n\r\nIn the desert regions of the earth we find an even more general\r\naccordance of colour with surroundings. The lion, the camel, and all the\r\ndesert antelopes have more or less the colour of the sand or rock among\r\nwhich they live. The Egyptian cat and the Pampas cat are sandy or earth\r\ncoloured. The Australian kangaroos are of similar tints, and the\r\noriginal colour of the wild horse is supposed to have been sandy or clay\r\ncoloured. Birds are equally well protected by assimilative hues; the\r\nlarks, quails, goatsuckers, and grouse which abound in the North African\r\nand Asiatic deserts are all tinted or mottled so as closely to resemble\r\nthe average colour of the soil in the districts they inhabit. Canon\r\nTristram, who knows these regions and their natural history so well,\r\nsays, in an often quoted passage: \"In the desert, where neither trees,\r\nbrushwood, nor even undulations of the surface afford the slightest\r\nprotection to its foes, a modification of colour which shall be\r\nassimilated to that of the surrounding country is absolutely necessary.\r\nHence, without exception, the upper plumage of every bird, whether lark,\r\nchat, sylvain, or sand-grouse, and also the fur of all the smaller\r\nmammals, and the skin of all the snakes and lizards, is of one uniform\r\nisabelline or sand colour.\"\r\n\r\nPassing on to the tropical regions, it is among their evergreen forests\r\nalone that we find whole groups of birds whose ground colour is green.\r\nParrots are very generally green, and in the East we have an extensive\r\ngroup of green fruit-eating pigeons; while the barbets, bee-eaters,\r\nturacos, leaf-thrushes (Phyllornis), white-eyes (Zosterops), and many\r\nother groups, have so much green in their plumage as to tend greatly to\r\ntheir concealment among the dense foliage. There can be no doubt that\r\nthese colours have been acquired as a protection, when we see that in\r\nall the temperate regions, where the leaves are deciduous, the ground\r\ncolour of the great majority of birds, especially on the upper surface,\r\nis a rusty brown of various shades, well corresponding with the bark,\r\nwithered leaves, ferns, and bare thickets among which they live in\r\nautumn and winter, and especially in early spring when so many of them\r\nbuild their nests.\r\n\r\nNocturnal animals supply another illustration of the same rule, in the\r\ndusky colours of mice, rats, bats, and moles, and in the soft mottled\r\nplumage of owls and goatsuckers which, while almost equally\r\ninconspicuous in the twilight, are such as to favour their concealment\r\nin the daytime.\r\n\r\nAn additional illustration of general assimilation of colour to the\r\nsurroundings of animals, is furnished by the inhabitants of the deep\r\noceans. Professor Moseley of the Challenger Expedition, in his British\r\nAssociation lecture on this subject, says: \"Most characteristic of\r\npelagic animals is the almost crystalline transparency of their bodies.\r\nSo perfect is this transparency that very many of them are rendered\r\nalmost entirely invisible when floating in the water, while some, even\r\nwhen caught and held up in a glass globe, are hardly to be seen. The\r\nskin, nerves, muscles, and other organs are absolutely hyaline and\r\ntransparent, but the liver and digestive tract often remain opaque and\r\nof a yellow or brown colour, and exactly resemble when seen in the water\r\nsmall pieces of floating seaweed.\" Such marine organisms, however, as\r\nare of larger size, and either occasionally or habitually float on the\r\nsurface, are beautifully tinged with blue above, thus harmonising with\r\nthe colour of the sea as seen by hovering birds; while they are white\r\nbelow, and are thus invisible against the wave-foam and clouds as seen\r\nby enemies beneath the surface. Such are the tints of the beautiful\r\nnudibranchiate mollusc, Glaucus atlanticus, and many others.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Theories of Animal Colour._\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to test the general theories, or, to speak more\r\ncorrectly, the popular notions, as to the origin of animal coloration,\r\nbefore proceeding to apply the principle of utility to the explanation\r\nof some among the many extraordinary manifestations of colour in the\r\nanimal world. The most generally received theory undoubtedly is, that\r\nbrilliancy and variety of colour are due to the direct action of light\r\nand heat; a theory no doubt derived from the abundance of\r\nbright-coloured birds, insects, and flowers which are brought from\r\ntropical regions. There are, however, two strong arguments against this\r\ntheory. We have already seen how generally bright coloration is wanting\r\nin desert animals, yet here heat and light are both at a maximum, and if\r\nthese alone were the agents in the production of colour, desert animals\r\nshould be the most brilliant. Again, all naturalists who have lived in\r\ntropical regions know that the proportion of bright to dull coloured\r\nspecies is little if any greater there than in the temperate zone, while\r\nthere are many tropical groups in which bright colours are almost\r\nentirely unknown. No part of the world presents so many brilliant birds\r\nas South America, yet there are extensive families, containing many\r\nhundreds of species, which are as plainly coloured as our average\r\ntemperate birds. Such are the families of the bush-shrikes and\r\nant-thrushes (Formicariidae), the tyrant-shrikes (Tyrannidae), the\r\nAmerican creepers (Dendrocolaptidae), together with a large proportion\r\nof the wood-warblers (Mniotiltidae), the finches, the wrens, and some\r\nother groups. In the eastern hemisphere, also, we have the\r\nbabbling-thrushes (Timaliidae), the cuckoo-shrikes (Campephagidae), the\r\nhoney-suckers (Meliphagidae), and several other smaller groups which are\r\ncertainly not coloured above the average standard of temperate birds.\r\n\r\nAgain, there are many families of birds which spread over the whole\r\nworld, temperate and tropical, and among these the tropical species\r\nrarely present any exceptional brilliancy of colour. Such are the\r\nthrushes, goatsuckers, hawks, plovers, and ducks; and in the last-named\r\ngroup it is the temperate and arctic zones that afford the most\r\nbrilliant coloration.\r\n\r\nThe same general facts are found to prevail among insects. Although\r\ntropical insects present some of the most gorgeous coloration in the\r\nwhole realm of nature, yet there are thousands and tens of thousands of\r\nspecies which are as dull coloured as any in our cloudy land. The\r\nextensive family of the carnivorous ground-beetles (Carabidae) attains\r\nits greatest brilliancy in the temperate zone; while by far the larger\r\nproportion of the great families of the longicorns and the weevils, are\r\nof obscure colours even in the tropics. In butterflies, there is\r\nundoubtedly a larger proportion of brilliant colour in the tropics; but\r\nif we compare families which are almost equally developed over the\r\nglobe--as the Pieridae or whites and yellows, and the Satyridae or\r\nringlets--we shall find no great disproportion in colour between those\r\nof temperate and tropical regions.\r\n\r\nThe various facts which have now briefly been noticed are sufficient to\r\nindicate that the light and heat of the sun are not the direct causes of\r\nthe colours of animals, although they may favour the production of\r\ncolour when, as in tropical regions, the persistent high temperature\r\nfavours the development of the maximum of life. We will now consider the\r\nnext suggestion, that light reflected from surrounding coloured objects\r\ntends to produce corresponding colours in the animal world.\r\n\r\nThis theory is founded on a number of very curious facts which prove,\r\nthat such a change does sometimes occur and is directly dependent on the\r\ncolours of surrounding objects; but these facts are comparatively rare\r\nand exceptional in their nature, and the same theory will certainly not\r\napply to the infinitely varied colours of the higher animals, many of\r\nwhich are exposed to a constantly varying amount of light and colour\r\nduring their active existence. A brief sketch of these dependent changes\r\nof colour may, however, be advantageously given here.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Variable Protective Colouring._\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct kinds of change of colour in animals due to the\r\ncolouring of the environment. In one case the change is caused by reflex\r\naction set up by the animal _seeing_ the colour to be imitated, and the\r\nchange produced can be altered or repeated as the animal changes its\r\nposition. In the other case the change occurs but once, and is probably\r\nnot due to any conscious or sense action, but to some direct influence\r\non the surface tissues while the creature is undergoing a moult or\r\nchange to the pupa form.\r\n\r\nThe most striking example of the first class is that of the chameleon,\r\nwhich changes to white, brown, yellowish, or green, according to the\r\ncolour of the object on which it rests. This change is brought about by\r\nmeans of two layers of pigment cells, deeply seated in the skin, and of\r\nbluish and yellowish colours. By suitable muscles these cells can be\r\nforced upwards so as to modify the colour of the skin, which, when they\r\nare not brought into action, is a dirty white. These animals are\r\nexcessively sluggish and defenceless, and the power of changing their\r\ncolour to that of their immediate surroundings is no doubt of great\r\nservice to them. Many of the flatfish are also capable of changing their\r\ncolour according to the colour of the bottom they rest on; and frogs\r\nhave a similar power to a limited extent. Some crustacea also change\r\ncolour, and the power is much developed in the Chameleon shrimp (Mysis\r\nChamaeleon) which is gray when on sand, but brown or green when among\r\nbrown or green seaweed. It has been proved by experiment that when this\r\nanimal is blinded the change does not occur. In all these cases,\r\ntherefore, we have some form of reflex or sense action by which the\r\nchange is produced, probably by means of pigment cells beneath the skin\r\nas in the chameleon.\r\n\r\nThe second class consists of certain larvae, and pupae, which undergo\r\nchanges of colour when exposed to differently coloured surroundings.\r\nThis subject has been carefully investigated by Mr. E.B. Poulton, who\r\nhas communicated the results of his experiments to the Royal\r\nSociety.[65] It had been noticed that some species of larvae which fed\r\non several different plants had colours more or less corresponding to\r\nthe particular plant the individual fed on. Numerous cases are given in\r\nProfessor Meldola's article on \"Variable Protective Colouring\" (_Proc.\r\nZool. Soc._, 1873, p. 153), and while the general green coloration was\r\nattributed to the presence of chlorophyll beneath the skin, the\r\nparticular change in correspondence to each food-plant was attributed to\r\na special function which had been developed by natural selection. Later\r\non, in a note to his translation of Weissmann's _Theory of Descent_,\r\nProfessor Meldola seemed disposed to think that the variations of colour\r\nof some of the species might be phytophagic--that is, due to the direct\r\naction of the differently coloured leaves on which the insect fed. Mr.\r\nPoulton's experiments have thrown much light on this question, since he\r\nhas conclusively proved that, in the case of the sphinx caterpillar of\r\nSmerinthus ocellatus, the change of colour is not due to the food but to\r\nthe coloured light reflected from the leaves.\r\n\r\nThis was shown by feeding two sets of larvae on the same plant but\r\nexposed to differently coloured surroundings, obtained by sewing the\r\nleaves together, so that in one case only the dark upper surface, in the\r\nother the whitish under surface was exposed to view. The result in each\r\ncase was a corresponding change of colour in the larvae, confirming the\r\nexperiments on different individuals of the same batch of larvae which\r\nhad been supplied with different food-plants or exposed to a different\r\ncoloured light.\r\n\r\nAn even more interesting series of experiments was made on the colours\r\nof pupae, which in many cases were known to be affected by the material\r\non which they underwent their transformations. The late Mr. T.W. Wood\r\nproved, in 1867, that the pupae of the common cabbage butterflies\r\n(Pieris brassicae and P. rapae) were either light, or dark, or green,\r\naccording to the coloured boxes they were kept in, or the colours of the\r\nfences, walls, etc., against which they were suspended. Mrs. Barber in\r\nSouth Africa found that the pupae of Papilio Nireus underwent a similar\r\nchange, being deep green when attached to orange leaves of the same\r\ntint, pale yellowish-green when on a branch of the bottle-brush tree\r\nwhose half-dried leaves were of this colour, and yellowish when attached\r\nto the wooden frame of a box. A few other observers noted similar\r\nphenomena, but nothing more was done till Mr. Poulton's elaborate series\r\nof experiments with the larvae of several of our common butterflies were\r\nthe means of clearing up several important points. He showed that the\r\naction of the coloured light did not affect the pupa itself but the\r\nlarva, and that only for a limited period of time. After a caterpillar\r\nhas done feeding it wanders about seeking a suitable place to undergo\r\nits transformation. When this is found it rests quietly for a day or\r\ntwo, spinning the web from which it is to suspend itself; and it is\r\nduring this period of quiescence, and perhaps also the first hour or two\r\nafter its suspension, that the action of the surrounding coloured\r\nsurfaces determines, to a considerable extent, the colour of the pupa.\r\nBy the application of various surrounding colours during this period,\r\nMr. Poulton was able to modify the colour of the pupa of the common\r\ntortoise-shell butterfly from nearly black to pale, or to a brilliant\r\ngolden; and that of Pieris rapae from dusky through pinkish to pale\r\ngreen. It is interesting to note, that the colours produced were in all\r\ncases such only as assimilated with the surroundings usually occupied by\r\nthe species, and also, that colours which did not occur in such\r\nsurroundings, as dark red or blue, only produced the same effects as\r\ndusky or black.\r\n\r\nCareful experiments were made to ascertain whether the effect was\r\nproduced through the sight of the caterpillar. The ocelli were covered\r\nwith black varnish, but neither this, nor cutting off the spines of the\r\ntortoise-shell larva to ascertain whether they might be sense-organs,\r\nproduced any effect on the resulting colour. Mr. Poulton concludes,\r\ntherefore, that the colour-action probably occurs over the whole surface\r\nof the body, setting up physiological processes which result in the\r\ncorresponding colour-change of the pupa. Such changes are, however, by\r\nno means universal, or even common, in protectively coloured pupae,\r\nsince in Papilio machaon and some others which have been experimented\r\non, both in this country and abroad, no change can be produced on the\r\npupa by any amount of exposure to differently coloured surroundings. It\r\nis a curious point that, with the small tortoise-shell larva, exposure\r\nto light from gilded surfaces produced pupae with a brilliant golden\r\nlustre; and the explanation is supposed to be that mica abounded in the\r\noriginal habitat of the species, and that the pupae thus obtained\r\nprotection when suspended against micaceous rock. Looking, however, at\r\nthe wide range of the species and the comparatively limited area in\r\nwhich micaceous rocks occur, this seems a rather improbable explanation,\r\nand the occurrence of this metallic appearance is still a difficulty. It\r\ndoes not, however, commonly occur in this country in a natural state.\r\n\r\nThe two classes of variable colouring here discussed are evidently\r\nexceptional, and can have little if any relation to the colours of those\r\nmore active creatures which are continually changing their position with\r\nregard to surrounding objects, and whose colours and markings are nearly\r\nconstant throughout the life of the individual, and (with the exception\r\nof sexual differences) in all the individuals of the species. We will\r\nnow briefly pass in review the various characteristics and uses of the\r\ncolours which more generally prevail in nature; and having already\r\ndiscussed those protective colours which serve to harmonise animals with\r\ntheir general environment, we have to consider only those cases in which\r\nthe colour resemblance is more local or special in its character.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Special or Local Colour Adaptations._\r\n\r\nThis form of colour adaptation is generally manifested by markings\r\nrather than by colour alone, and is extremely prevalent both among\r\ninsects and vertebrates, so that we shall be able to notice only a few\r\nillustrative cases. Among our native birds we have the snipe and\r\nwoodcock, whose markings and tints strikingly accord with the dead marsh\r\nvegetation among which they live; the ptarmigan in its summer dress is\r\nmottled and tinted exactly like the lichens which cover the stones of\r\nthe higher mountains; while young unfledged plovers are spotted so as\r\nexactly to resemble the beach pebbles among which they crouch for\r\nprotection, as beautifully exhibited in one of the cases of British\r\nbirds in the Natural History Museum at South Kensington.\r\n\r\nIn mammalia, we notice the frequency of rounded spots on forest or tree\r\nhaunting animals of large size, as the forest deer and the forest cats;\r\nwhile those that frequent reedy or grassy places are striped vertically,\r\nas the marsh antelopes and the tiger. I had long been of opinion that\r\nthe brilliant yellow and black stripes of the tiger were adaptive, but\r\nhave only recently obtained proof that it is so. An experienced\r\ntiger-hunter, Major Walford, states in a letter, that the haunts of the\r\ntiger are invariably full of the long grass, dry and pale yellow for at\r\nleast nine months of the year, which covers the ground wherever there is\r\nwater in the rainy season, and he adds: \"I once, while following up a\r\nwounded tiger, failed for at least a minute to see him under a tree in\r\ngrass at a distance of about twenty yards--jungle open--but the natives\r\nsaw him, and I eventually made him out well enough to shoot him, but\r\neven then I could not see at what part of him I was aiming. There can be\r\nno doubt whatever that the colour of both the tiger and the panther\r\nrenders them almost invisible, especially in a strong blaze of light,\r\nwhen among grass, and one does not seem to notice stripes or spots till\r\nthey are dead.\" It is the black shadows of the vegetation that\r\nassimilate with the black stripes of the tiger; and, in like manner,\r\nthe spotty shadows of leaves in the forest so harmonise with the spots\r\nof ocelots, jaguars, tiger-cats, and spotted deer as to afford them a\r\nvery perfect concealment.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the concealment is effected by colours and markings which\r\nare so striking and peculiar that no one who had not seen the creature\r\nin its native haunts would imagine them to be protective. An example of\r\nthis is afforded by the banded fruit pigeon of Timor, whose pure white\r\nhead and neck, black wings and back, yellow belly, and deeply-curved\r\nblack band across the breast, render it a very handsome and conspicuous\r\nbird. Yet this is what Mr. H.O. Forbes says of it: \"On the trees the\r\nwhite-headed fruit pigeon (Ptilopus cinctus) sate motionless during the\r\nheat of the day in numbers, on well-exposed branches; but it was with\r\nthe utmost difficulty that I or my sharp-eyed native servant could ever\r\ndetect them, even in trees where we knew they were sitting.\"[66] The\r\ntrees referred to are species of Eucalyptus which abound in Timor. They\r\nhave whitish or yellowish bark and very open foliage, and it is the\r\nintense sunlight casting black curved shadows of one branch upon\r\nanother, with the white and yellow bark and deep blue sky seen through\r\nopenings of the foliage, that produces the peculiar combination of\r\ncolours and shadows to which the colours and markings of this bird have\r\nbecome so closely assimilated.\r\n\r\nEven such brilliant and gorgeously coloured birds as the sun-birds of\r\nAfrica are, according to an excellent observer, often protectively\r\ncoloured. Mrs. M.E. Barber remarks that \"A casual observer would\r\nscarcely imagine that the highly varnished and magnificently coloured\r\nplumage of the various species of Noctarinea could be of service to\r\nthem, yet this is undoubtedly the case. The most unguarded moments of\r\nthe lives of these birds are those that are spent amongst the flowers,\r\nand it is then that they are less wary than at any other time. The\r\ndifferent species of aloes, which blossom in succession, form the\r\nprincipal sources of their winter supplies of food; and a legion of\r\nother gay flowering plants in spring and summer, the aloe blossoms\r\nespecially, are all brilliantly coloured, and they harmonise admirably\r\nwith the gay plumage of the different species of sun-birds. Even the\r\nkeen eye of a hawk will fail to detect them, so closely do they resemble\r\nthe flowers they frequent. The sun-birds are fully aware of this fact,\r\nfor no sooner have they relinquished the flowers than they become\r\nexceedingly wary and rapid in flight, darting arrow-like through the air\r\nand seldom remaining in exposed situations. The black sun-bird\r\n(Nectarinea amethystina) is never absent from that magnificent\r\nforest-tree, the 'Kaffir Boom' (Erythrina caffra); all day long the\r\ncheerful notes of these birds may be heard amongst its spreading\r\nbranches, yet the general aspect of the tree, which consists of a huge\r\nmass of scarlet and purple-black blossoms without a single green leaf,\r\nblends and harmonises with the colours of the black sun-bird to such an\r\nextent that a dozen of them may be feeding amongst its blossoms without\r\nbeing conspicuous, or even visible.\"[67]\r\n\r\nSome other cases will still further illustrate how the colours of even\r\nvery conspicuous animals may be adapted to their peculiar haunts.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. Swinhoe says of the Kerivoula picta, which he observed in\r\nFormosa: \"The body of this bat was of an orange colour, but the wings\r\nwere painted with orange-yellow and black. It was caught suspended, head\r\ndownwards, on a cluster of the fruit of the longan tree (Nephelium\r\nlonganum). Now this tree is an evergreen, and all the year round some\r\nportion of its foliage is undergoing decay, the particular leaves being,\r\nin such a stage, partially orange and black. This bat can, therefore, at\r\nall seasons suspend from its branches and elude its enemies by its\r\nresemblance to the leaves of the tree.\"[68]\r\n\r\nEven more curious is the case of the sloths--defenceless animals which\r\nfeed upon leaves, and hang from the branches of trees with their back\r\ndownwards. Most of the species have a curious buff-coloured spot on the\r\nback, rounded or oval in shape and often with a darker border, which\r\nseems placed there on purpose to make them conspicuous; and this was a\r\ngreat puzzle to naturalists, because the long coarse gray or greenish\r\nhair was evidently like tree-moss and therefore protective. But an old\r\nwriter, Baron von Slack, in his _Voyage_ _to Surinam_ (1810), had\r\nalready explained the matter. He says: \"The colour and even the shape of\r\nthe hair are much like withered moss, and serve to hide the animal in\r\nthe trees, but particularly when it has that orange-coloured spot\r\nbetween the shoulders and lies close to the tree; it looks then exactly\r\nlike a piece of branch where the rest has been broken off, by which the\r\nhunters are often deceived.\" Even such a huge animal as the giraffe is\r\nsaid to be perfectly concealed by its colour and form when standing\r\namong the dead and broken trees that so often occur on the outskirts of\r\nthe thickets where it feeds. The large blotch-like spots on the skin and\r\nthe strange shape of the head and horns, like broken branches, so tend\r\nto its concealment that even the keen-eyed natives have been known to\r\nmistake trees for giraffes or giraffes for trees.\r\n\r\nInnumerable examples of this kind of protective colouring occur among\r\ninsects; beetles mottled like the bark of trees or resembling the sand\r\nor rock or moss on which they live, with green caterpillars of the exact\r\ngeneral tints of the foliage they feed on; but there are also many cases\r\nof detailed imitation of particular objects by insects that must be\r\nbriefly described.[69]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Protective Imitation of Particular Objects._\r\n\r\nThe insects which present this kind of imitation most perfectly are the\r\nPhasmidae, or stick and leaf insects. The well-known leaf-insects of\r\nCeylon and of Java, species of Phyllium, are so wonderfully coloured and\r\nveined, with leafy expansions on the legs and thorax, that not one\r\nperson in ten can see them when resting on the food-plant close beneath\r\ntheir eyes. Others resemble pieces of stick with all the minutiae of\r\nknots and branches, formed by the insects' legs, which are stuck out\r\nrigidly and unsymmetrically. I have often been unable to distinguish\r\nbetween one of these insects and a real piece of stick, till I satisfied\r\nmyself by touching it and found it to be alive. One species, which was\r\nbrought me in Borneo, was covered with delicate semitransparent green\r\nfoliations, exactly resembling the hepaticae which cover pieces of\r\nrotten stick in the damp forests. Others resemble dead leaves in all\r\ntheir varieties of colour and form; and to show how perfect is the\r\nprotection obtained and how important it is to the possessors of it, the\r\nfollowing incident, observed by Mr. Belt in Nicaragua, is most\r\ninstructive. Describing the armies of foraging ants in the forest which\r\ndevour every insect they can catch, he says: \"I was much surprised with\r\nthe behaviour of a green leaf-like locust. This insect stood immovably\r\namong a host of ants, many of which ran over its legs without ever\r\ndiscovering there was food within their reach. So fixed was its\r\ninstinctive knowledge that its safety depended on its immovability, that\r\nit allowed me to pick it up and replace it among the ants without making\r\na single effort to escape. This species closely resembles a green\r\nleaf.\"[70]\r\n\r\nCaterpillars also exhibit a considerable amount of detailed resemblance\r\nto the plants on which they live. Grass-feeders are striped\r\nlongitudinally, while those on ordinary leaves are always striped\r\nobliquely. Some very beautiful protective resemblances are shown among\r\nthe caterpillars figured in Smith and Abbott's _Lepidopterous Insects of\r\nGeorgia_, a work published in the early part of the century, before any\r\ntheories of protection were started. The plates in this work are most\r\nbeautifully executed from drawings made by Mr. Abbott, representing the\r\ninsects, in every case, on the plants which they frequented, and no\r\nreference is made in the descriptions to the remarkable protective\r\ndetails which appear upon the plates. We have, first, the larva of\r\nSphinx fuciformis feeding on a plant with linear grass-like leaves and\r\nsmall blue flowers; and we find the insect of the same green as the\r\nleaves, striped longitudinally in accordance with the linear leaves, and\r\nwith the head blue corresponding both in size and colour with the\r\nflowers. Another species (Sphinx tersa) is represented feeding on a\r\nplant with small red flowers situated in the axils of the leaves; and\r\nthe larva has a row of seven red spots, unequal in size, and\r\ncorresponding very closely with the colour and size of the flowers. Two\r\nother figures of sphinx larvae are very curious. That of Sphinx\r\npampinatrix feeds on a wild vine (Vitis indivisa), having green\r\ntendrils, and in this species the curved horn on the tail is green, and\r\nclosely imitates in its curve the tip of the tendril. But in another\r\nspecies (Sphinx cranta), which feeds on the fox-grape (Vitis vulpina),\r\nthe horn is very long and red, corresponding with the long red-tipped\r\ntendrils of the plant. Both these larvae are green with oblique stripes,\r\nto harmonise with the veined leaves of the vines; but a figure is also\r\ngiven of the last-named species after it has done feeding, when it is of\r\na decided brown colour and has entirely lost its horn. This is because\r\nit then descends to the ground to bury itself, and the green colour and\r\nred horn would be conspicuous and dangerous; it therefore loses both at\r\nthe last moult. Such a change of colour occurs in many species of\r\ncaterpillars. Sometimes the change is seasonal; and, in those which\r\nhibernate with us, the colour of some species, which is brownish in\r\nautumn in adaptation to the fading foliage, becomes green in spring to\r\nharmonise with the newly-opened leaves at that season.[71]\r\n\r\nSome of the most curious examples of minute imitation are afforded by\r\nthe caterpillars of the geometer moths, which are always brown or\r\nreddish, and resemble in form little twigs of the plant on which they\r\nfeed. They have the habit, when at rest, of standing out obliquely from\r\nthe branch, to which they hold on by their hind pair of prolegs or\r\nclaspers, and remain motionless for hours. Speaking of these protective\r\nresemblances Mr. Jenner Weir says: \"After being thirty years an\r\nentomologist I was deceived myself, and took out my pruning scissors to\r\ncut from a plum tree a spur which I thought I had overlooked. This\r\nturned out to be the larva of a geometer two inches long. I showed it\r\nto several members of my family, and defined a space of four inches in\r\nwhich it was to be seen, but none of them could perceive that it was a\r\ncaterpillar.\"[72]\r\n\r\nOne more example of a protected caterpillar must be given. Mr. A.\r\nEverett, writing from Sarawak, Borneo, says: \"I had a caterpillar\r\nbrought me, which, being mixed by my boy with some other things, I took\r\nto be a bit of moss with two exquisite pinky-white seed-capsules; but I\r\nsoon saw that it moved, and examining it more closely found out its real\r\ncharacter: it is covered with hair, with two little pink spots on the\r\nupper surface, the general hue being more green. Its motions are very\r\nslow, and when eating the head is withdrawn beneath a fleshy mobile\r\nhood, so that the action of feeding does not produce any movement\r\nexternally. It was found in the limestone hills at Busan, the situation\r\nof all others where mosses are most plentiful and delicate, and where\r\nthey partially clothe most of the protruding masses of rock.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_How these Imitations have been Produced._\r\n\r\nTo many persons it will seem impossible that such beautiful and detailed\r\nresemblances as those now described--and these are only samples of\r\nthousands that occur in all parts of the world--can have been brought\r\nabout by the preservation of accidental useful variations. But this will\r\nnot seem so surprising if we keep in mind the facts set forth in our\r\nearlier chapters--the rapid multiplication, the severe struggle for\r\nexistence, and the constant variability of these and all other\r\norganisms. And, further, we must remember that these delicate\r\nadjustments are the result of a process which has been going on for\r\nmillions of years, and that we now see the small percentage of successes\r\namong the myriads of failures. From the very first appearance of insects\r\nand their various kinds of enemies the need of protection arose, and was\r\nusually most easily met by modifications of colour. Hence, we may be\r\nsure that the earliest leaf-eating insects acquired a green colour as\r\none of the necessities of their existence; and, as the species became\r\nmodified and specialised, those feeding on particular species of plants\r\nwould rapidly acquire the peculiar tints and markings best adapted to\r\nconceal them upon those plants. Then, every little variation that, once\r\nin a hundred years perhaps, led to the preservation of some larva which\r\nwas thereby rather better concealed than its fellows, would form the\r\nstarting-point of a further development, leading ultimately to that\r\nperfection of imitation in details which now astonishes us. The\r\nresearches of Dr. Weismann illustrate this progressive adaptation. The\r\nvery young larvae of several species are green or yellowish without any\r\nmarkings; they then, in subsequent moults, obtain certain markings, some\r\nof which are often lost again before the larva is fully grown. The early\r\nstages of those species which, like elephant hawk-moths (Chaerocampa),\r\nhave the anterior segments elongated and retractile, with large eye-like\r\nspots to imitate the head of a vertebrate, are at first like those of\r\nnon-retractile species, the anterior segments being as large as the\r\nrest. After the first moult they become smaller, comparatively; but it\r\nis only after the second moult that the ocelli begin to appear, and\r\nthese are not fully defined till after the third moult. This progressive\r\ndevelopment of the individual--the ontogeny--gives us a clue to the\r\nancestral development of the whole race--the phylogeny; and we are\r\nenabled to picture to ourselves the very slow and gradual steps by which\r\nthe existing perfect adaptation has been brought about. In many larvae\r\ngreat variability still exists, and in some there are two or more\r\ndistinctly-coloured forms--usually a dark and a light or a brown and a\r\ngreen form. The larva of the humming-bird hawk-moth (Macroglossa\r\nstellatarum) varies in this manner, and Dr. Weismann raised five\r\nvarieties from a batch of eggs from one moth. It feeds on species of\r\nbedstraw (Galium verum and G. mollugo), and as the green forms are less\r\nabundant than the brown, it has probably undergone some recent change of\r\nfood-plant or of habits which renders brown the more protective colour.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Special Protective Colouring of Butterflies._\r\n\r\nWe will now consider a few cases of special protective colouring in the\r\nperfect butterfly or moth. Mr. Mansel Weale states that in South Africa\r\nthere is a great prevalence of white and silvery foliage or bark,\r\nsometimes of dazzling brilliancy, and that many insects and their larvae\r\nhave brilliant silvery tints which are protective, among them being\r\nthree species of butterflies whose undersides are silvery, and which are\r\nthus effectually protected when at rest.[73] A common African butterfly\r\n(Aterica meleagris) always settles on the ground with closed wings,\r\nwhich so closely resemble the soil of the district that it can with\r\ndifficulty be seen, and the colour varies with the soil in different\r\nlocalities. Thus specimens from Senegambia were dull brown, the soil\r\nbeing reddish sand and iron-clay; those from Calabar and Cameroons were\r\nlight brown with numerous small white spots, the soil of those countries\r\nbeing light brown clay with small quartz pebbles; while in other\r\nlocalities where the colours of the soil were more varied the colours of\r\nthe butterfly varied also. Here we have variation in a single species\r\nwhich has become specialised in certain areas to harmonise with the\r\ncolour of the soil.[74]\r\n\r\nMany butterflies, in all parts of the world, resemble dead leaves on\r\ntheir under side, but those in which this form of protection is carried\r\nto the greatest perfection are the species of the Eastern genus Kallima.\r\nIn India K. inachis, and in the larger Malay islands K. paralekta, are\r\nvery common. They are rather large and showy butterflies, orange and\r\nbluish on the upper side, with a very rapid flight, and frequenting dry\r\nforests. Their habit is to settle always where there is some dead or\r\ndecaying foliage, and the shape and colour of the wings (on the under\r\nsurface), together with the attitude of the insect, is such as to\r\nproduce an absolutely perfect imitation of a dead leaf. This is effected\r\nby the butterfly always settling on a twig, with the short tail of the\r\nhind wings just touching it and forming the leaf-stalk. From this a dark\r\ncurved line runs across to the elongated tip of the upper wings,\r\nimitating the midrib, on both sides of which are oblique lines, formed\r\npartly by the nervures and partly by markings, which give the effect of\r\nthe usual veining of a leaf. The head and antennae fit exactly between\r\nthe closed upper wings so as not to interfere with the outline, which\r\nhas just that amount of irregular curvature that is seen in dry and\r\nwithered leaves. The colour is very remarkable for its extreme amount of\r\nvariability, from deep reddish-brown to olive or pale yellow, hardly two\r\nspecimens being exactly alike, but all coming within the range of colour\r\nof leaves in various stages of decay. Still more curious is the fact\r\nthat the paler wings, which imitate leaves most decayed, are usually\r\ncovered with small black dots, often gathered into circular groups, and\r\nso exactly resembling the minute fungi on decaying leaves that it is\r\nhard at first to believe that the insects themselves are not attacked by\r\nsome such fungus. The concealment produced by this wonderful imitation\r\nis most complete, and in Sumatra I have often seen one enter a bush and\r\nthen disappear like magic. Once I was so fortunate as to see the exact\r\nspot on which the insect settled; but even then I lost sight of it for\r\nsome time, and only after a persistent search discovered that it was\r\nclose before my eyes.[75] Here we have a kind of imitation, which is\r\nvery common in a less developed form, carried to extreme perfection,\r\nwith the result that the species is very abundant over a considerable\r\narea of country.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Protective Resemblance among Marine Animals._\r\n\r\nAmong marine animals this form of protection is very common. Professor\r\nMoseley tells us that all the inhabitants of the Gulf-weed are most\r\nremarkably coloured, for purposes of protection and concealment, exactly\r\nlike the weed itself. \"The shrimps and crabs which swarm in the weed are\r\nof exactly the same shade of yellow as the weed, and have white markings\r\nupon their bodies to represent the patches of Membranipora. The small\r\nfish, Antennarius, is in the same way weed-colour with white spots. Even\r\na Planarian worm, which lives in the weed, is similarly yellow-coloured,\r\nand also a mollusc, Scyllaea pelagica.\" The same writer tells us that \"a\r\nnumber of little crabs found clinging to the floats of the blue-shelled\r\nmollusc, Ianthina, were all coloured of a corresponding blue for\r\nconcealment.\"[76]\r\n\r\nProfessor E.S. Morse of Salem, Mass., found that most of the New\r\nEngland marine mollusca were protectively coloured; instancing among\r\nothers a little red chiton on rocks clothed with red calcareous algae,\r\nand Crepidula plana, living within the apertures of the shells of larger\r\nspecies of Gasteropods and of a pure white colour corresponding to its\r\nhabitat, while allied species living on seaweed or on the outside of\r\ndark shells were dark brown.[77] A still more interesting case has been\r\nrecorded by Mr. George Brady. He says: \"Amongst the Nullipore which\r\nmatted together the laminaria roots in the Firth of Clyde were living\r\nnumerous small starfishes (Ophiocoma bellis) which, except when their\r\nwrithing movements betrayed them, were quite undistinguishable from the\r\ncalcareous branches of the alga; their rigid angularly twisted rays had\r\nall the appearance of the coralline, and exactly assimilated to its dark\r\npurple colour, so that though I held in my hand a root in which were\r\nhalf a dozen of the starfishes, I was really unable to detect them until\r\nrevealed by their movements.\"[78]\r\n\r\nThese few examples are sufficient to show that the principle of\r\nprotective coloration extends to the ocean as well as over the earth;\r\nand if we consider how completely ignorant we are of the habits and\r\nsurroundings of most marine animals, it may well happen that many of the\r\ncolours of tropical fishes, which seem to us so strange and so\r\nconspicuous, are really protective, owing to the number of equally\r\nstrange and brilliant forms of corals, sea-anemones, sponges, and\r\nseaweeds among which they live.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Protection by Terrifying Enemies._\r\n\r\nA considerable number of quite defenceless insects obtain protection\r\nfrom some of their enemies by having acquired a resemblance to dangerous\r\nanimals, or by some threatening or unusual appearance. This is obtained\r\neither by a modification of shape, of habits, of colour, or of all\r\ncombined. The simplest form of this protection is the aggressive\r\nattitude of the caterpillars of the Sphingidae, the forepart of the body\r\nbeing erected so as to produce a rude resemblance to the figure of a\r\nsphinx, hence the name of the family. The protection is carried further\r\nby those species which retract the first three segments and have large\r\nocelli on each side of the fourth segment, thus giving to the\r\ncaterpillar, when the forepart of its body is elevated, the appearance\r\nof a snake in a threatening attitude.\r\n\r\nThe blood-red forked tentacle, thrown out of the neck of the larvae of\r\nthe genus Papilio when alarmed, is, no doubt, a protection against the\r\nattacks of ichneumons, and may, perhaps, also frighten small birds; and\r\nthe habit of turning up the tail possessed by the harmless rove-beetles\r\n(Staphylinidae), giving the idea that they can sting, has, probably, a\r\nsimilar use. Even an unusual angular form, like a crooked twig or\r\ninorganic substance, may be protective; as Mr. Poulton thinks is the\r\ncase with the curious caterpillar of Notodonta ziczac, which, by means\r\nof a few slight protuberances on its body, is able to assume an angular\r\nand very unorganic-looking appearance. But perhaps the most perfect\r\nexample of this kind of protection is exhibited by the large caterpillar\r\nof the Royal Persimmon moth (Bombyx regia), a native of the southern\r\nstates of North America, and known there as the \"Hickory-horned devil.\"\r\nIt is a large green caterpillar, often six inches long, ornamented with\r\nan immense crown of orange-red tubercles, which, if disturbed, it erects\r\nand shakes from side to side in a very alarming manner. In its native\r\ncountry the negroes believe it to be as deadly as a rattlesnake, whereas\r\nit is perfectly innocuous. The green colour of the body suggests that\r\nits ancestors were once protectively coloured; but, growing too large to\r\nbe effectually concealed, it acquired the habit of shaking its head\r\nabout in order to frighten away its enemies, and ultimately developed\r\nthe crown of tentacles as an addition to its terrifying powers. This\r\nspecies is beautifully figured in Abbott and Smith's _Lepidopterous\r\nInsects of Georgia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alluring Coloration._\r\n\r\nBesides those numerous insects which obtain protection through their\r\nresemblance to the natural objects among which they live, there are some\r\nwhose disguise is not used for concealment, but as a direct means of\r\nsecuring their prey by attracting them within the enemy's reach. Only a\r\nfew cases of this kind of coloration have yet been observed, chiefly\r\namong spiders and mantidae; but, no doubt, if attention were given to\r\nthe subject in tropical countries, many more would be discovered. Mr.\r\nH.O. Forbes has described a most interesting example of this kind of\r\nsimulation in Java. While pursuing a large butterfly through the jungle,\r\nhe was stopped by a dense bush, on a leaf of which he observed one of\r\nthe skipper butterflies sitting on a bird's dropping. \"I had often,\" he\r\nsays, \"observed small Blues at rest on similar spots on the ground, and\r\nhave wondered what such a refined and beautiful family as the Lycaenidae\r\ncould find to enjoy, in food apparently so incongruous for a butterfly.\r\nI approached with gentle steps, but ready net, to see if possible how\r\nthe present species was engaged. It permitted me to get quite close, and\r\neven to seize it between my fingers; to my surprise, however, part of\r\nthe body remained behind, adhering as I thought to the excreta. I looked\r\nclosely, and finally touched with my finger the excreta to find if it\r\nwere glutinous. To my delighted astonishment I found that my eyes had\r\nbeen most perfectly deceived, and that what seemed to be the excreta was\r\na most artfully coloured spider, lying on its back with its feet crossed\r\nover and closely adpressed to the body.\" Mr. Forbes then goes on to\r\ndescribe the exact appearance of such excreta, and how the various parts\r\nof the spider are coloured to produce the imitation, even to the liquid\r\nportion which usually runs a little down the leaf. This is exactly\r\nimitated by a portion of the thin web which the spider first spins to\r\nsecure himself firmly to the leaf; thus producing, as Mr. Forbes\r\nremarks, a living bait for butterflies and other insects so artfully\r\ncontrived as to deceive a pair of human eyes, even when intently\r\nexamining it.[79]\r\n\r\nA native species of spider (Thomisus citreus) exhibits a somewhat\r\nsimilar alluring protection by its close resemblance to buds of the\r\nwayfaring tree, Viburnum lantana. It is pure creamy-white, the abdomen\r\nexactly resembling in shape and colour the unopened buds of the flowers\r\namong which it takes its station; and it has been seen to capture flies\r\nwhich came to the flowers.\r\n\r\nBut the most curious and beautiful case of alluring protection is that\r\nof a wingless Mantis in India, which is so formed and coloured as to\r\nresemble a pink orchis or some other fantastic flower. The whole insect\r\nis of a bright pink colour, the large and oval abdomen looking like the\r\nlabellum of an orchid. On each side, the two posterior legs have\r\nimmensely dilated and flattened thighs which represent the petals of a\r\nflower, while the neck and forelegs imitate the upper sepal and column\r\nof an orchid. The insect rests motionless, in this symmetrical attitude,\r\namong bright green foliage, being of course very conspicuous, but so\r\nexactly resembling a flower that butterflies and other insects settle\r\nupon it and are instantly captured. It is a living trap, baited in the\r\nmost alluring manner to catch the unwary flower-haunting insects.[80]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Coloration of Birds' Eggs._\r\n\r\nThe colours of birds' eggs have long been a difficulty on the theory of\r\nadaptive coloration, because, in so many cases it has not been easy to\r\nsee what can be the use of the particular colours, which are often so\r\nbright and conspicuous that they seem intended to attract attention\r\nrather than to be concealed. A more careful consideration of the subject\r\nin all its bearings shows, however, that here too, in a great number of\r\ncases, we have examples of protective coloration. When, therefore, we\r\ncannot see the meaning of the colour, we may suppose that it has been\r\nprotective in some ancestral form, and, not being hurtful, has persisted\r\nunder changed conditions which rendered the protection needless.\r\n\r\nWe may divide all eggs, for our present purpose, into two great\r\ndivisions; those which are white or nearly so, and those which are\r\ndistinctly coloured or spotted. Egg-shells being composed mainly of\r\ncarbonate of lime, we may assume that the primitive colour of birds'\r\neggs was white, a colour that prevails now among the other egg-bearing\r\nvertebrates--lizards, crocodiles, turtles, and snakes; and we might,\r\ntherefore, expect that this colour would continue where its presence had\r\nno disadvantages. Now, as a matter of fact, we find that in all the\r\ngroups of birds which lay their eggs in concealed places, whether in\r\nholes of trees or in the ground, or in domed or covered nests, the eggs\r\nare either pure white or of very pale uniform coloration. Such is the\r\ncase with kingfishers, bee-eaters, penguins, and puffins, which nest in\r\nholes in the ground; with the great parrot family, the woodpeckers, the\r\nrollers, hoopoes, trogons, owls, and some others, which build in holes\r\nin trees or other concealed places; while martins, wrens,\r\nwillow-warblers, and Australian finches, build domed or covered nests,\r\nand usually have white eggs.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, many other birds which lay their white eggs in open\r\nnests; and these afford some very interesting examples of the varied\r\nmodes by which concealment may be obtained. All the duck tribe, the\r\ngrebes, and the pheasants belong to this class; but these birds all have\r\nthe habit of covering their eggs with dead leaves or other material\r\nwhenever they leave the nest, so as effectually to conceal them. Other\r\nbirds, as the short-eared owl, the goatsucker, the partridge, and some\r\nof the Australian ground pigeons, lay their white or pale eggs on the\r\nbare soil; but in these cases the birds themselves are protectively\r\ncoloured, so that, when sitting, they are almost invisible; and they\r\nhave the habit of sitting close and almost continuously, thus\r\neffectually concealing their eggs.\r\n\r\nPigeons and doves offer a very curious case of the protection of exposed\r\neggs. They usually build very slight and loose nests of sticks and\r\ntwigs, so open that light can be seen through them from below, while\r\nthey are generally well concealed by foliage above. Their eggs are white\r\nand shining; yet it is a difficult matter to discover, from beneath,\r\nwhether there are eggs in the nest or not, while they are well hidden by\r\nthe thick foliage above. The Australian podargihuge goatsuckers--build\r\nvery similar nests, and their white eggs are protected in the same\r\nmanner. Some large and powerful birds, as the swans, herons, pelicans,\r\ncormorants, and storks, lay white eggs in open nests; but they keep\r\ncareful watch over them, and are able to drive away intruders. On the\r\nwhole, then, we see that, while white eggs are conspicuous, and\r\ntherefore especially liable to attack by egg-eating animals, they are\r\nconcealed from observation in many and various ways. We may, therefore,\r\nassume that, in cases where there seems to be no such concealment, we\r\nare too ignorant of the whole of the conditions to form a correct\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the large class of coloured or richly spotted eggs, and\r\nhere we have a more difficult task, though many of them decidedly\r\nexhibit protective tints or markings. There are two birds which nest on\r\nsandy shores--the lesser tern and the ringed plover,--and both lay\r\nsand-coloured eggs, the former spotted so as to harmonise with coarse\r\nshingle, the latter minutely speckled like fine sand, which are the\r\nkinds of ground the two birds choose respectively for their nests. \"The\r\ncommon sandpipers' eggs assimilate so closely with the tints around them\r\nas to make their discovery a matter of no small difficulty, as every\r\noologist can testify who has searched for them. The pewits' eggs, dark\r\nin ground colour and boldly marked, are in strict harmony with the sober\r\ntints of moor and fallow, and on this circumstance alone their\r\nconcealment and safety depend. The divers' eggs furnish another example\r\nof protective colour; they are generally laid close to the water's edge,\r\namongst drift and shingle, where their dark tints and black spots\r\nconceal them by harmonising closely with surrounding objects. The snipes\r\nand the great army of sandpipers furnish innumerable instances of\r\nprotectively coloured eggs. In all the instances given the sitting-bird\r\ninvariably leaves the eggs uncovered when it quits them, and\r\nconsequently their safety depends solely on the colours which adorn\r\nthem.\"[81] The wonderful range of colour and marking in the eggs of the\r\nguillemot may be imputed to the inaccessible rocks on which it breeds,\r\ngiving it complete protection from enemies. Thus the pale or bluish\r\nground colour of the eggs of its allies, the auks and puffins, has\r\nbecome intensified and blotched and spotted in the most marvellous\r\nvariety of patterns, owing to there being no selective agency to prevent\r\nindividual variation having full sway.\r\n\r\nThe common black coot (Fulica atra) has eggs which are coloured in a\r\nspecially protective manner. Dr. William Marshall writes, that it only\r\nbreeds in certain localities where a large water reed (Phragmites\r\narundinacea) abounds. The eggs of the coot are stained and spotted with\r\nblack on a yellowish-gray ground, and the dead leaves of the reed are of\r\nthe same colour, and are stained black by small parasitic fungi of the\r\nUredo family; and these leaves form the bed on which the eggs are laid.\r\nThe eggs and the leaves agree so closely in colour and markings that it\r\nis a difficult thing to distinguish the eggs at any distance. It is to\r\nbe noted that the coot never covers up its eggs, as its ally the\r\nmoor-hen usually does.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful blue or greenish eggs of the hedge-sparrow, the\r\nsong-thrush, and sometimes those of the blackbird, seem at first sight\r\nespecially calculated to attract attention, but it is very doubtful\r\nwhether they are really so conspicuous when seen at a little distance\r\namong their usual surroundings. For the nests of these birds are either\r\nin evergreens, as holly or ivy, or surrounded by the delicate green\r\ntints of our early spring vegetation, and may thus harmonise very well\r\nwith the colours around them. The great majority of the eggs of our\r\nsmaller birds are so spotted or streaked with brown or black on\r\nvariously tinted grounds that, when lying in the shadow of the nest and\r\nsurrounded by the many colours and tints of bark and moss, of purple\r\nbuds and tender green or yellow foliage, with all the complex glittering\r\nlights and mottled shades produced among these by the spring sunshine\r\nand by sparkling raindrops, they must have a quite different aspect from\r\nthat which they possess when we observe them torn from their natural\r\nsurroundings. We have here, probably, a similar case of general\r\nprotective harmony to that of the green caterpillars with beautiful\r\nwhite or purple bands and spots, which, though gaudily conspicuous when\r\nseen alone, become practically invisible among the complex lights and\r\nshadows of the foliage they feed upon.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the cuckoo, which lays its eggs in the nests of a variety\r\nof other birds, the eggs themselves are subject to considerable\r\nvariations of colour, the most common type, however, resembling those of\r\nthe pipits, wagtails, or warblers, in whose nests they are most\r\nfrequently laid. It also often lays in the nest of the hedge-sparrow,\r\nwhose bright blue eggs are usually not at all nearly matched, although\r\nthey are sometimes said to be so on the Continent. It is the opinion of\r\nmany ornithologists that each female cuckoo lays the same coloured eggs,\r\nand that it usually chooses a nest the owners of which lay somewhat\r\nsimilar eggs, though this is by no means universally the case. Although\r\nbirds which have cuckoos' eggs imposed upon them do not seem to neglect\r\nthem on account of any difference of colour, yet they probably do so\r\noccasionally; and if, as seems probable, each bird's eggs are to some\r\nextent protected by their harmony of colour with their surroundings, the\r\npresence of a larger and very differently coloured egg in the nest might\r\nbe dangerous, and lead to the destruction of the whole set. Those\r\ncuckoos, therefore, which most frequently placed their eggs among the\r\nkinds which they resembled, would in the long run leave most progeny,\r\nand thus the very frequent accord in colour might have been brought\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nSome writers have suggested that the varied colours of birds' eggs are\r\nprimarily due to the effect of surrounding coloured objects on the\r\nfemale bird during the period preceding incubation; and have expended\r\nmuch ingenuity in suggesting the objects that may have caused the eggs\r\nof one bird to be blue, another brown, and another pink.[82] But no\r\nevidence has been presented to prove that any effects whatever are\r\nproduced by this cause, while there seems no difficulty in accounting\r\nfor the facts by individual variability and the action of natural\r\nselection. The changes that occur in the conditions of existence of\r\nbirds must sometimes render the concealment less perfect than it may\r\nonce have been; and when any danger arises from this cause, it may be\r\nmet either by some change in the colour of the eggs, or in the\r\nstructure or position of the nest, or by the increased care which the\r\nparents bestow upon the eggs. In this way the various divergences which\r\nnow so often puzzle us may have arisen.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Colour as a Means of Recognition._\r\n\r\nIf we consider the habits and life-histories of those animals which are\r\nmore or less gregarious, comprising a large proportion of the herbivora,\r\nsome carnivora, and a considerable number of all orders of birds, we\r\nshall see that a means of ready recognition of its own kind, at a\r\ndistance or during rapid motion, in the dusk of twilight or in partial\r\ncover, must be of the greatest advantage and often lead to the\r\npreservation of life. Animals of this kind will not usually receive a\r\nstranger into their midst. While they keep together they are generally\r\nsafe from attack, but a solitary straggler becomes an easy prey to the\r\nenemy; it is, therefore, of the highest importance that, in such a case,\r\nthe wanderer should have every facility for discovering its companions\r\nwith certainty at any distance within the range of vision.\r\n\r\nSome means of easy recognition must be of vital importance to the young\r\nand inexperienced of each flock, and it also enables the sexes to\r\nrecognise their kind and thus avoid the evils of infertile crosses; and\r\nI am inclined to believe that its necessity has had a more widespread\r\ninfluence in determining the diversities of animal coloration than any\r\nother cause whatever. To it may probably be imputed the singular fact\r\nthat, whereas bilateral symmetry of coloration is very frequently lost\r\namong domesticated animals, it almost universally prevails in a state of\r\nnature; for if the two sides of an animal were unlike, and the diversity\r\nof coloration among domestic animals occurred in a wild state, easy\r\nrecognition would be impossible among numerous closely allied forms.[83]\r\nThe wonderful diversity of colour and of marking that prevails,\r\nespecially in birds and insects, may be due to the fact that one of the\r\nfirst needs of a new species would be, to keep separate from its nearest\r\nallies, and this could be most readily done by some easily seen external\r\nmark of difference. A few illustrations will serve to show how this\r\nprinciple acts in nature.\r\n\r\nMy attention was first called to the subject by a remark of Mr. Darwin's\r\nthat, though, \"the hare on her form is a familiar instance of\r\nconcealment through colour, yet the principle partly fails in a closely\r\nallied species, the rabbit; for when running to its burrow it is made\r\nconspicuous to the sportsman, and no doubt to all beasts of prey, by its\r\nupturned white tail.\"[84] But a little consideration of the habits of\r\nthe animal will show that the white upturned tail is of the greatest\r\nvalue, and is really, as it has been termed by a writer in _The Field_,\r\na \"signal flag of danger.\" For the rabbit is usually a crepuscular\r\nanimal, feeding soon after sunset or on moonlight nights. When disturbed\r\nor alarmed it makes for its burrow, and the white upturned tails of\r\nthose in front serve as guides and signals to those more remote from\r\nhome, to the young and the feeble; and thus each following the one or\r\ntwo before it, all are able with the least possible delay to regain a\r\nplace of comparative safety. The apparent danger, therefore, becomes a\r\nmost important means of security.\r\n\r\nThe same general principle enables us to understand the singular, and\r\noften conspicuous, markings on so many gregarious herbivora which are\r\nyet, on the whole, protectively coloured. Thus, the American prong-buck\r\nhas a white patch behind and a black muzzle. The Tartarian antelope, the\r\nOvis poli of High Asia, the Java wild ox, several species of deer, and a\r\nlarge number of antelopes have a similar conspicuous white patch behind,\r\nwhich, in contrast to the dusky body, must enable them to be seen and\r\nfollowed from a distance by their fellows. Where there are many species\r\nof nearly the same general size and form inhabiting the same region--as\r\nwith the antelopes of Africa--we find many distinctive markings of a\r\nsimilar kind. The gazelles have variously striped and banded faces,\r\nbesides white patches behind and on the flanks, as shown in the woodcut.\r\nThe spring-bok has a white patch on the face and one on the sides, with\r\na curiously distinctive white stripe above the tail, which is nearly\r\nconcealed when the animal is at rest by a fold of skin but comes into\r\nfull view when it is in motion, being thus quite analogous to the\r\nupturned white tail of the rabbit. In the pallah the white rump-mark is\r\nbordered with black, and the peculiar shape of the horns distinguishes\r\nit when seen from the front. The sable-antelope, the gems-bok, the oryx,\r\nthe hart-beest, the bonte-bok, and the addax have each peculiar white\r\nmarkings; and they are besides characterised by horns so remarkably\r\ndifferent in each species and so conspicuous, that it seems probable\r\nthat the peculiarities in length, twist, and curvature have been\r\ndifferentiated for the purpose of recognition, rather than for any\r\nspeciality of defence in species whose general habits are so similar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Gazella soemmerringi.]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that these markings for recognition are very\r\nslightly developed in the antelopes of the woods and marshes. Thus, the\r\ngrys-bok is nearly uniform in colour, except the long black-tipped ears;\r\nand it frequents the wooded mountains. The duyker-bok and the rhoode-bok\r\nare wary bush-haunters, and have no marks but the small white patch\r\nbehind. The wood-haunting bosch-bok goes in pairs, and has hardly any\r\ndistinctive marks on its dusky chestnut coat, but the male alone is\r\nhorned. The large and handsome koodoo frequents brushwood, and its\r\nvertical white stripes are no doubt protective, while its magnificent\r\nspiral horns afford easy recognition. The eland, which is an inhabitant\r\nof the open country, is uniformly coloured, being sufficiently\r\nrecognisable by its large size and distinctive form; but the Derbyan\r\neland is a forest animal, and has a protectively striped coat. In like\r\nmanner, the fine Speke's antelope, which lives entirely in the swamps\r\nand among reeds, has pale vertical stripes on the sides (protective),\r\nwith white markings on face and breast for recognition. An inspection of\r\nthe figures of antelopes and other animals in Wood's _Natural History_,\r\nor in other illustrated works, will give a better idea of the\r\npeculiarities of recognition markings than any amount of description.\r\n\r\nOther examples of such coloration are to be seen in the dusky tints of\r\nthe musk-sheep and the reindeer, to whom recognition at a distance on\r\nthe snowy plains is of more importance than concealment from their few\r\nenemies. The conspicuous stripes and bands of the zebra and the quagga\r\nare probably due to the same cause, as may be the singular crests and\r\nface-marks of several of the monkeys and lemurs.[85]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19--Recognition marks of three African plovers.]\r\n\r\nAmong birds, these recognition marks are especially numerous and\r\nsuggestive. Species which inhabit open districts are usually\r\nprotectively coloured; but they generally possess some distinctive\r\nmarkings for the purpose of being easily recognised by their kind, both\r\nwhen at rest and during flight. Such are, the white bands or patches on\r\nthe breast or belly of many birds, but more especially the head and neck\r\nmarkings in the form of white or black caps, collars, eye-marks or\r\nfrontal patches, examples of which are seen in the three species of\r\nAfrican plovers figured on page 221.\r\n\r\nRecognition marks during flight are very important for all birds which\r\ncongregate in flocks or which migrate together; and it is essential\r\nthat, while being as conspicuous as possible, the marks shall not\r\ninterfere with the general protective tints of the species when at rest.\r\nHence they usually consist of well-contrasted markings on the wings and\r\ntail, which are concealed during repose but become fully visible when\r\nthe bird takes flight. Such markings are well seen in our four British\r\nspecies of shrikes, each having quite different white marks on the\r\nexpanded wings and on the tail feathers; and the same is the case with\r\nour three species of Saxicola--the stone-chat, whin-chat, and\r\nwheat-ear--which are thus easily recognisable on the wing, especially\r\nwhen seen from above, as they would be by stragglers looking out for\r\ntheir companions. The figures opposite, of the wings of two African\r\nspecies of stone-curlew which are sometimes found in the same districts,\r\nwell illustrates these specific recognition marks. Though not very\r\ngreatly different to our eyes, they are no doubt amply so to the sharp\r\nvision of the birds themselves.\r\n\r\nBesides the white patches on the primaries here shown, the secondary\r\nfeathers are, in some cases, so coloured as to afford very distinctive\r\nmarkings during flight, as seen in the central secondary quills of two\r\nAfrican coursers (Fig. 21).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Oedicnemus vermiculatus (above). Oe.\r\nsenegalensis (below).]\r\n\r\nMost characteristic of all, however, are the varied markings of the\r\nouter tail-feathers, whose purpose is so well shown by their being\r\nalmost always covered during repose by the two middle feathers, which\r\nare themselves quite unmarked and protectively tinted like the rest of\r\nthe upper surface of the body. The figures of the expanded tails of two\r\nspecies of East Asiatic snipe, whose geographical ranges overlap each\r\nother, will serve to illustrate this difference; which is frequently\r\nmuch greater and modified in an endless variety of ways (Fig. 22).\r\n\r\nNumbers of species of pigeons, hawks, finches, warblers, ducks, and\r\ninnumerable other birds possess this class of markings; and they\r\ncorrespond so exactly in general character with those of the mammalia,\r\nalready described, that we cannot doubt they serve a similar\r\npurpose.[86]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--Secondary quills.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--Scolopax megala (upper). S. stenura (lower).]\r\n\r\nThose birds which are inhabitants of tropical forests, and which need\r\nrecognition marks that shall be at all times visible among the dense\r\nfoliage, and not solely or chiefly during flight, have usually small but\r\nbrilliant patches of colour on the head or neck, often not interfering\r\nwith the generally protective character of their plumage. Such are the\r\nbright patches of blue, red, or yellow, by which the usually green\r\nEastern barbets are distinguished; and similar bright patches of colour\r\ncharacterise the separate species of small green fruit-doves. To this\r\nnecessity for specialisation in colour, by which each bird may easily\r\nrecognise its kind, is probably due that marvellous variety in the\r\npeculiar beauties of some groups of birds. The Duke of Argyll, speaking\r\nof the humming birds, made the objection that \"A crest of topaz is no\r\nbetter in the struggle for existence than a crest of sapphire. A frill\r\nending in spangles of the emerald is no better in the battle of life\r\nthan a frill ending in spangles of the ruby. A tail is not affected for\r\nthe purposes of flight, whether its marginal or its central feathers are\r\ndecorated with white;\" and he goes on to urge that mere beauty and\r\nvariety for their own sake are the only causes of these differences.\r\nBut, on the principles here suggested, the divergence itself is useful,\r\nand must have been produced _pari passu_ with the structural differences\r\non which the differentiation of species depends; and thus we have\r\nexplained the curious fact that prominent differences of colour often\r\ndistinguish species otherwise very closely allied to each other.\r\n\r\nAmong insects, the principle of distinctive coloration for recognition\r\nhas probably been at work in the production of the wonderful diversity\r\nof colour and marking we find everywhere, more especially among the\r\nbutterflies and moths; and here its chief function may have been to\r\nsecure the pairing together of individuals of the same species. In some\r\nof the moths this has been secured by a peculiar odour, which attracts\r\nthe males to the females from a distance; but there is no evidence that\r\nthis is universal or even general, and among butterflies, especially,\r\nthe characteristic colour and marking, aided by size and form, afford\r\nthe most probable means of recognition. That this is so is shown by the\r\nfact that \"the common white butterfly often flies down to a bit of paper\r\non the ground, no doubt mistaking it for one of its own species;\" while,\r\naccording to Mr. Collingwood, in the Malay Archipelago, \"a dead\r\nbutterfly pinned upon a conspicuous twig will often arrest an insect of\r\nthe same species in its headlong flight, and bring it down within easy\r\nreach of the net, especially if it be of the opposite sex.\"[87] In a\r\ngreat number of insects, no doubt, form, motions, stridulating sounds,\r\nor peculiar odours, serve to distinguish allied species from each other,\r\nand this must be especially the case with nocturnal insects, or with\r\nthose whose colours are nearly uniform and are determined by the need of\r\nprotection; but by far the larger number of day-flying and active\r\ninsects exhibit varieties of colour and marking, forming the most\r\nobvious distinction between allied species, and which have, therefore,\r\nin all probability been acquired in the process of differentiation for\r\nthe purpose of checking the intercrossing of closely allied forms.[88]\r\n\r\nWhether this principle extends to any of the less highly organised\r\nanimals is doubtful, though it may perhaps have affected the higher\r\nmollusca. But in marine animals it seems probable that the colours,\r\nhowever beautiful, varied, and brilliant they may often be, are in most\r\ncases protective, assimilating them to the various bright-coloured\r\nseaweeds, or to some other animals which it is advantageous for them to\r\nimitate.[89]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Summary of the Preceding Exposition._\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to discuss some of the more recondite phenomena of\r\nanimal coloration, it will be well to consider for a moment the extent\r\nof the ground we have already covered. Protective coloration, in some of\r\nits varied forms, has not improbably modified the appearance of one-half\r\nof the animals living on the globe. The white of arctic animals, the\r\nyellowish tints of the desert forms, the dusky hues of crepuscular and\r\nnocturnal species, the transparent or bluish tints of oceanic creatures,\r\nrepresent a vast host in themselves; but we have an equally numerous\r\nbody whose tints are adapted to tropical foliage, to the bark of trees,\r\nor to the soil or dead leaves on or among which they habitually live.\r\nThen we have the innumerable special adaptations to the tints and forms\r\nof leaves, or twigs, or flowers; to bark or moss; to rock or pebble; by\r\nwhich such vast numbers of the insect tribes obtain protection; and we\r\nhave seen that these various forms of coloration are equally prevalent\r\nin the waters of the seas and oceans, and are thus coextensive with the\r\ndomain of life upon the earth. The comparatively small numbers which\r\npossess \"terrifying\" or \"alluring\" coloration may be classed under the\r\ngeneral head of the protectively coloured.\r\n\r\nBut under the next head--colour for recognition--we have a totally\r\ndistinct category, to some extent antagonistic or complementary to the\r\nlast, since its essential principle is visibility rather than\r\nconcealment. Yet it has been shown, I think, that this mode of\r\ncoloration is almost equally important, since it not only aids in the\r\npreservation of existing species and in the perpetuation of pure races,\r\nbut was, perhaps, in its earlier stages, a not unimportant factor in\r\ntheir development. To it we owe most of the variety and much of the\r\nbeauty in the colours of animals; it has caused at once bilateral\r\nsymmetry and general permanence of type; and its range of action has\r\nbeen perhaps equally extensive with that of coloration for concealment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Influence of Locality or of Climate on Colour._\r\n\r\nCertain relations between locality and coloration have long been\r\nnoticed. Mr. Gould observed that birds from inland or continental\r\nlocalities were more brightly coloured than those living near the\r\nsea-coast or on islands, and he supposed that the more brilliant\r\natmosphere of the inland stations was the explanation of the\r\nphenomenon.[90] Many American naturalists have observed similar facts,\r\nand they assert that the intensity of the colours of birds and mammals\r\nincreases from north to south, and also with the increase of humidity.\r\nThis change is imputed by Mr. J.A. Allen to the direct action of the\r\nenvironment. He says: \"In respect to the correlation of intensity of\r\ncolour in animals with the degree of humidity, it would perhaps be more\r\nin accordance with cause and effect to express the law of correlation as\r\na _decrease_ of intensity of colour with a _decrease_ of humidity, the\r\npaleness evidently resulting from exposure and the blanching effect of\r\nintense sunlight, and a dry, often intensely heated atmosphere. With the\r\ndecrease of the aqueous precipitation the forest growth and the\r\nprotection afforded by arborescent vegetation gradually also decreases,\r\nas of course does also the protection afforded by clouds, the\r\nexcessively humid regions being also regions of extreme cloudiness,\r\nwhile the dry regions are comparatively cloudless districts.\"[91] Almost\r\nidentical changes occur in birds, and are imputed by Mr. Allen to\r\nsimilar causes.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that Mr. Gould and Mr. Allen impute opposite effects to\r\nthe same cause, brilliancy or intensity of colour being due to a\r\nbrilliant atmosphere according to the former, while paleness of colour\r\nis imputed by the latter to a too brilliant sun. According to the\r\nprinciples which have been established by the consideration of arctic,\r\ndesert, and forest animals respectively, we shall be led to conclude\r\nthat there has been no direct action in this case, but that the effects\r\nobserved are due to the greater or less need of protection. The pale\r\ncolour that is prevalent in arid districts is in harmony with the\r\ngeneral tints of the surface; while the brighter tints or more intense\r\ncoloration, both southward and in humid districts, are sufficiently\r\nexplained by the greater shelter due to a more luxuriant vegetation and\r\na shorter winter. The advocates of the theory that intensity of light\r\ndirectly affects the colours of organisms, are led into perpetual\r\ninconsistencies. At one time the brilliant colours of tropical birds and\r\ninsects are imputed to the intensity of a tropical sun, while the same\r\nintensity of sunlight is now said to have a \"bleaching\" effect. The\r\ncomparatively dull and sober hues of our northern fauna were once\r\nsupposed to be the result of our cloudy skies; but now we are told that\r\ncloudy skies and a humid atmosphere intensify colour.\r\n\r\nIn my _Tropical Nature_ (pp. 257-264) I have called attention to what is\r\nperhaps the most curious and decided relation of colour to locality\r\nwhich has yet been observed--the prevalence of white markings in the\r\nbutterflies and birds of islands.\r\n\r\nSo many cases are adduced from so many different islands, both in the\r\neastern and western hemisphere, that it is impossible to doubt the\r\nexistence of some common cause; and it seems probable to me now, after a\r\nfuller consideration of the whole subject of colour, that here too we\r\nhave one of the almost innumerable results of the principle of\r\nprotective coloration. White is, as a rule, an uncommon colour in\r\nanimals, but probably only because it is so conspicuous. Whenever it\r\nbecomes protective, as in the case of arctic animals and aquatic birds,\r\nit appears freely enough; while we know that white varieties of many\r\nspecies occur occasionally in the wild state, and that, under\r\ndomestication, white or parti-coloured breeds are freely produced. Now\r\nin all the islands in which exceptionally white-marked birds and\r\nbutterflies have been observed, we find two features which would tend to\r\nrender the conspicuous white markings less injurious--a luxuriant\r\ntropical vegetation, and a decided scarcity of rapacious mammals and\r\nbirds. White colours, therefore, would not be eliminated by natural\r\nselection; but variations in this direction would bear their part in\r\nproducing the recognition marks which are everywhere essential, and\r\nwhich, in these islands, need not be so small or so inconspicuous as\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Concluding Remarks._\r\n\r\nOn a review of the whole subject, then, we must conclude that there is\r\nno evidence of the individual or prevalent colours of organisms being\r\ndirectly determined by the amount of light, or heat, or moisture, to\r\nwhich they are exposed; while, on the other hand, the two great\r\nprinciples of the need of concealment from enemies or from their prey,\r\nand of recognition by their own kind, are so wide-reaching in their\r\napplication that they appear at first sight to cover almost the whole\r\nground of animal coloration. But, although they are indeed wonderfully\r\ngeneral and have as yet been very imperfectly studied, we are acquainted\r\nwith other modes of coloration which have a different origin. These\r\nchiefly appertain to the very singular class of warning colours, from\r\nwhich arise the yet more extraordinary phenomena of mimicry; and they\r\nopen up so curious a field of inquiry and present so many interesting\r\nproblems, that a chapter must be devoted to them. Yet another chapter\r\nwill be required by the subject of sexual differentiation of colour and\r\nornament, as to the origin and meaning of which I have arrived at\r\ndifferent conclusions from Mr. Darwin. These various forms of coloration\r\nhaving been discussed and illustrated, we shall be in a position to\r\nattempt a brief sketch of the fundamental laws which have determined the\r\ngeneral coloration of the animal world.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: _Proceedings of the Royal Society_, No. 243, 1886;\r\n_Transactions of the Royal Society_, vol. clxxviii.

He says: \"Holding the larva of Sphinx ligustri in one hand\r\nand a twig of its food-plant in the other, the wonder we feel is, not at\r\nthe resemblance but at the difference; we are surprised at the\r\ndifficulty experienced in detecting so conspicuous an object. And yet\r\nthe protection is very real, for the larvae will be passed over by those\r\nwho are not accustomed to their appearance, although the searcher may be\r\ntold of the presence of a large caterpillar. An experienced entomologist\r\nmay also fail to find the larvae till after a considerable search. This\r\nis general protective resemblance, and it depends upon a general harmony\r\nbetween the appearance of the organism and its whole environment. It is\r\nimpossible to understand the force of this protection for any larva,\r\nwithout seeing it on its food-plant and in an entirely normal condition.\r\nThe artistic effect of green foliage is more complex than we often\r\nimagine; numberless modifications are wrought by varied lights and\r\nshadows upon colours which are in themselves far from uniform. In the\r\nlarva of Papilio machaon the protection is very real when the larva is\r\non the food-plant, and can hardly be appreciated at all when the two are\r\napart.\" Numerous other examples are given in the chapter on \"Mimicry and\r\nother Protective Resemblances among Animals,\" in my _Contributions to\r\nthe Theory of Natural Selection_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: _The Naturalist in Nicaragua_, p. 19.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: R.

Among wild animals the\r\nskunk varies considerably in the amount of white on the body, and this\r\ntoo was found to be usually greatest on the left side. A close\r\nexamination of numerous striped or spotted species, as tigers, leopards,\r\njaguars, zebras, etc., showed that the bilateral symmetry was not exact,\r\nalthough the general effect of the two sides was the same. This is\r\nprecisely what we should expect if the symmetry is not the result of a\r\ngeneral law of the organisation, but has been, in part at least,\r\nproduced and preserved for the useful purpose of recognition by the\r\nanimal's fellows of the same species, and especially by the sexes and\r\nthe young.

Zebras\r\nusually go in bands, and are so swift and wary that they are in little\r\ndanger during the day. It is in the evening, or on moonlight nights,\r\nwhen they go to drink, that they are chiefly exposed to attack; and Mr.\r\nFrancis Galton, who has studied these animals in their native haunts,\r\nassures me, that in twilight they are not at all conspicuous, the\r\nstripes of white and black so merging together into a gray tint that it\r\nis very difficult to see them at a little distance. We have here an\r\nadmirable illustration of how a glaringly conspicuous style of marking\r\nfor recognition may be so arranged as to become also protective at the\r\ntime when protection is most needed; and we may also learn how\r\nimpossible it is for us to decide on the inutility of any kind of\r\ncoloration without a careful study of the habits of the species in its\r\nnative country.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: The principle of colouring for recognition was, I believe,\r\nfirst stated in my article on \"The Colours of Animals and Plants\" in\r\nMacmillan's _Magazine_, and more fully in my volume on _Tropical\r\nNature_.

The reason of this is that the animals in question\r\nare either the possessors of some deadly weapons, as stings or poison\r\nfangs, or they are uneatable, and are thus so disagreeable to the usual\r\nenemies of their kind that they are never attacked when their peculiar\r\npowers or properties are known. It is, therefore, important that they\r\nshould not be mistaken for defenceless or eatable species of the same\r\nclass or order, since in that case they might suffer injury, or even\r\ndeath, before their enemies discovered the danger or the uselessness of\r\nthe attack. They require some signal or danger-flag which shall serve as\r\na warning to would-be enemies not to attack them, and they have usually\r\nobtained this in the form of conspicuous or brilliant coloration, very\r\ndistinct from the protective tints of the defenceless animals allied to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_The Skunk as illustrating Warning Coloration._\r\n\r\nWhile staying a few days, in July 1887, at the Summit Hotel on the\r\nCentral Pacific Railway, I strolled out one evening after dinner, and on\r\nthe road, not fifty yards from the house, I saw a pretty little white\r\nand black animal with a bushy tail coming towards me. As it came on at a\r\nslow pace and without any fear, although it evidently saw me, I thought\r\nat first that it must be some tame creature, when it suddenly occurred\r\nto me that it was a skunk. It came on till within five or six yards of\r\nme, then quietly climbed over a dwarf wall and disappeared under a small\r\nouthouse, in search of chickens, as the landlord afterwards told me.\r\nThis animal possesses, as is well known, a most offensive secretion,\r\nwhich it has the power of ejecting over its enemies, and which\r\neffectually protects it from attack. The odour of this substance is so\r\npenetrating that it taints, and renders useless, everything it touches,\r\nor in its vicinity. Provisions near it become uneatable, and clothes\r\nsaturated with it will retain the smell for several weeks, even though\r\nthey are repeatedly washed and dried. A drop of the liquid in the eyes\r\nwill cause blindness, and Indians are said not unfrequently to lose\r\ntheir sight from this cause. Owing to this remarkable power of offence\r\nthe skunk is rarely attacked by other animals, and its black and white\r\nfur, and the bushy white tail carried erect when disturbed, form the\r\ndanger-signals by which it is easily distinguished in the twilight or\r\nmoonlight from unprotected animals. Its consciousness that it needs only\r\nto be seen to be avoided gives it that slowness of motion and\r\nfearlessness of aspect which are, as we shall see, characteristic of\r\nmost creatures so protected.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Warning Colours among Insects._\r\n\r\nIt is among insects that warning colours are best developed, and most\r\nabundant. We all know how well marked and conspicuous are the colours\r\nand forms of the stinging wasps and bees, no one of which in any part of\r\nthe world is known to be protectively coloured like the majority of\r\ndefenceless insects. Most of the great tribe of Malacoderms among\r\nbeetles are distasteful to insect-eating animals. Our red and black\r\nTelephoridae, commonly called \"soldiers and sailors,\" were found, by Mr.\r\nJenner Weir, to be refused by small birds. These and the allied\r\nLampyridae (the fireflies and glow-worms) in Nicaragua, were rejected by\r\nMr. Belt's tame monkey and by his fowls, though most other insects were\r\ngreedily eaten by them. The Coccinellidae or lady-birds are another\r\nuneatable group, and their conspicuous and singularly spotted bodies\r\nserve to distinguish them at a glance from all other beetles.\r\n\r\nThese uneatable insects are probably more numerous than is supposed,\r\nalthough we already know immense numbers that are so protected. The most\r\nremarkable are the three families of butterflies--Heliconidae, Danaidae,\r\nand Acraeidae--comprising more than a thousand species, and\r\ncharacteristic respectively of the three great tropical regions--South\r\nAmerica, Southern Asia, and Africa. All these butterflies have\r\npeculiarities which serve to distinguish them from every other group in\r\ntheir respective regions. They all have ample but rather weak wings, and\r\nfly slowly; they are always very abundant; and they all have conspicuous\r\ncolours or markings, so distinct from those of other families that, in\r\nconjunction with their peculiar outline and mode of flight, they can\r\nusually be recognised at a glance. Other distinctive features are, that\r\ntheir colours are always nearly the same on the under surface of their\r\nwings as on the upper; they never try to conceal themselves, but rest on\r\nthe upper surfaces of leaves or flowers; and, lastly, they all have\r\njuices which exhale a powerful scent, so that when one kills them by\r\npinching the body, the liquid that exudes stains the fingers yellow, and\r\nleaves an odour that can only be removed by repeated washings.\r\n\r\nNow, there is much direct evidence to show that this odour, though not\r\nvery offensive to us, is so to most insect-eating creatures. Mr. Bates\r\nobserved that, when set out to dry, specimens of Heliconidae were less\r\nsubject to the attacks of vermin; while both he and I noticed that they\r\nwere not attacked by insect-eating birds or dragonflies, and that their\r\nwings were not found in the forest paths among the numerous wings of\r\nother butterflies whose bodies had been devoured. Mr. Belt once observed\r\na pair of birds capturing insects for their young; and although the\r\nHeliconidae swarmed in the vicinity, and from their slow flight could\r\nhave been easily caught, not one was ever pursued, although other\r\nbutterflies did not escape. His tame monkey also, which would greedily\r\nmunch up other butterflies, would never eat the Heliconidae. It would\r\nsometimes smell them, but always rolled them up in its hand and then\r\ndropped them.\r\n\r\nWe have also some corresponding evidence as to the distastefulness of\r\nthe Eastern Danaidae. The Hon. Mr. Justice Newton, who assiduously\r\ncollected and took notes upon the Lepidoptera of Bombay, informed Mr.\r\nButler of the British Museum that the large and swift-flying butterfly\r\nCharaxes psaphon, was continually persecuted by the bulbul, so that he\r\nrarely caught a specimen of this species which had not a piece snipped\r\nout of the hind wings. He offered one to a bulbul which he had in a\r\ncage, and it was greedily devoured, whilst it was only by repeated\r\npersecution that he succeeded in inducing the bird to touch a\r\nDanais.[92]\r\n\r\nBesides these three families of butterflies, there are certain groups of\r\nthe great genus Papilio--the true swallow-tailed butterflies--which have\r\nall the characteristics of uneatable insects. They have a special\r\ncoloration, usually red and black (at least in the females), they fly\r\nslowly, they are very abundant, and they possess a peculiar odour\r\nsomewhat like that of the Heliconidae. One of these groups is common in\r\ntropical America, another in tropical Asia, and it is curious that,\r\nalthough not very closely allied, they have each the same red and black\r\ncolours, and are very distinct from all the other butterflies of their\r\nrespective countries. There is reason to believe also that many of the\r\nbrilliantly coloured and weak-flying diurnal moths, like the fine\r\ntropical Agaristidae and burnet-moths, are similarly protected, and that\r\ntheir conspicuous colours serve as a warning of inedibility. The common\r\nburnet-moth (Anthrocera filipendula) and the equally conspicuous\r\nragwort-moth (Euchelia jacobeae) have been proved to be distasteful to\r\ninsect-eating creatures.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting and most conclusive example of warning coloration\r\nis, however, furnished by caterpillars, because in this case the facts\r\nhave been carefully ascertained experimentally by competent observers.\r\nIn the year 1866, when Mr. Darwin was collecting evidence as to the\r\nsupposed effect of sexual selection in bringing about the brilliant\r\ncoloration of the higher animals, he was struck by the fact that many\r\ncaterpillars have brilliant and conspicuous colours, in the production\r\nof which sexual selection could have no place. We have numbers of such\r\ncaterpillars in this country, and they are characterised not only by\r\ntheir gay colours but by not concealing themselves. Such are the mullein\r\nand the gooseberry caterpillars, the larvae of the spurge hawk-moth, of\r\nthe buff-tip, and many others. Some of these caterpillars are\r\nwonderfully conspicuous, as in the case of that noticed by Mr. Bates in\r\nSouth America, which was four inches long, banded across with black and\r\nyellow, and with bright red head, legs, and tail. Hence it caught the\r\neye of any one who passed by, even at the distance of many yards.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin asked me to try and suggest some explanation of this\r\ncoloration; and, having been recently interested in the question of the\r\nwarning coloration of butterflies, I suggested that this was probably a\r\nsimilar case,--that these conspicuous caterpillars were distasteful to\r\nbirds and other insect-eating creatures, and that their bright\r\nnon-protective colours and habit of exposing themselves to view, enabled\r\ntheir enemies to distinguish them at a glance from the edible kinds and\r\nthus learn not to touch them; for it must be remembered that the bodies\r\nof caterpillars while growing are so delicate, that a wound from a\r\nbird's beak would be perhaps as fatal as if they were devoured.[93] At\r\nthis time not a single experiment or observation had been made on the\r\nsubject, but after I had brought the matter before the Entomological\r\nSociety, two gentlemen, who kept birds and other tame animals, undertook\r\nto make experiments with a variety of caterpillars.\r\n\r\nMr. Jenner Weir was the first to experiment with ten species of small\r\nbirds in his aviary, and he found that none of them would eat the\r\nfollowing smooth-skinned conspicuous caterpillars--Abraxas\r\ngrossulariata, Diloba caeruleocephala, Anthrocera filipendula, and\r\nCucullia verbasci. He also found that they would not touch any hairy or\r\nspiny larvae, and he was satisfied that it was not the hairs or the\r\nspines, but the unpleasant taste that caused them to be rejected,\r\nbecause in one case a young smooth larva of a hairy species, and in\r\nanother case the pupa of a spiny larva, were equally rejected. On the\r\nother hand, all green or brown caterpillars as well as those that\r\nresemble twigs were greedily devoured.[94]\r\n\r\nMr. A.G. Butler also made experiments with some green lizards (Lacerta\r\nviridis), which greedily ate all kinds of food, including flies of many\r\nkinds, spiders, bees, butterflies, and green caterpillars; but they\r\nwould not touch the caterpillar of the gooseberry-moth (Abraxas\r\ngrossulariata), or the imago of the burnet-moth (Anthrocera\r\nfilipendula). The same thing happened with frogs. When the gooseberry\r\ncaterpillars were first given to them, \"they sprang forward and licked\r\nthem eagerly into their mouths; no sooner, however, had they done so,\r\nthan they seemed to become aware of the mistake that they had made, and\r\nsat with gaping mouths, rolling their tongues about, until they had got\r\nquit of the nauseous morsels, which seemed perfectly uninjured, and\r\nwalked off as briskly as ever.\" Spiders seemed equally to dislike them.\r\nThis and another conspicuous caterpillar (Halia wavaria) were rejected\r\nby two species--the geometrical garden spider (Epeira diadema) and a\r\nhunting spider.[95]\r\n\r\nSome further experiments with lizards were made by Professor Weismann,\r\nquite confirming the previous observations; and in 1886 Mr. E.B. Poulton\r\nof Oxford undertook a considerable series of experiments, with many\r\nother species of larvae and fresh kinds of lizards and frogs. Mr.\r\nPoulton then reviewed the whole subject, incorporating all recorded\r\nfacts, as well as some additional observations made by Mr. Jenner Weir\r\nin 1886. More than a hundred species of larvae or of perfect insects of\r\nvarious orders have now been made the subject of experiment, and the\r\nresults completely confirm my original suggestion. In almost every case\r\nthe protectively coloured larvae have been greedily eaten by all kinds\r\nof insectivorous animals, while, in the immense majority of cases, the\r\nconspicuous, hairy, or brightly coloured larvae have been rejected by\r\nsome or all of them. In some instances the inedibility of the larvae\r\nextends to the perfect insect, but not in others. In the former cases\r\nthe perfect insect is usually adorned with conspicuous colours, as the\r\nburnet and ragwort moths; but in the case of the buff-tip, the moth\r\nresembles a broken piece of rotten stick, yet it is partly inedible,\r\nbeing refused by lizards. It is, however, very doubtful whether these\r\nare its chief enemies, and its protective form and colour may be needed\r\nagainst insectivorous birds or mammals.\r\n\r\nMr. Samuel H. Scudder, who has largely bred North American butterflies,\r\nhas found so many of the eggs and larvae destroyed by hymenopterous and\r\ndipterous parasites that he thinks at least nine-tenths, perhaps a\r\ngreater proportion, never reach maturity. Yet he has never found any\r\nevidence that such parasites attack either the egg or the larva of the\r\ninedible Danais archippus, so that in this case the insect is\r\ndistasteful to its most dangerous foes in all the stages of its\r\nexistence, a fact which serves to explain its great abundance and its\r\nextension over almost the whole world.[96]\r\n\r\nOne case has been found of a protectively coloured larva,--one,\r\nmoreover, which in all its habits shows that it trusts to concealment to\r\nescape its enemies--which was yet always rejected by lizards after they\r\nhad seized it, evidently under the impression that from its colour it\r\nwould be eatable. This is the caterpillar of the very common moth Mania\r\ntypica; and Mr. Poulton thinks that, in this case, the unpleasant taste\r\nis an incidental result of some physiological processes in the organism,\r\nand is itself a merely useless character. It is evident that the insect\r\nwould not conceal itself so carefully as it does if it had not some\r\nenemies, and these are probably birds or small mammals, as its\r\nfood-plants are said to be dock and willow-herb, not suggestive of\r\nplaces frequented by lizards; and it has been found by experiment that\r\nlizards and birds have not always the same likes and dislikes. The case\r\nis interesting, because it shows that nauseous fluids sometimes occur\r\nsporadically, and may thus be intensified by natural selection when\r\nrequired for the purpose of protection. Another exceptional case is\r\nthat of the very conspicuous caterpillar of the spurge hawk-moth\r\n(Deilephila euphorbiae), which was at once eaten by a lizard, although,\r\nas it exposes itself on its food-plant in the daytime and is very\r\nabundant in some localities, it must almost certainly be disliked by\r\nbirds or by some animals who would otherwise devour it. If disturbed\r\nwhile feeding it is said to turn round with fury and eject a quantity of\r\ngreen liquid, of an acid and disagreeable smell similar to that of the\r\nspurge milk, only worse.[97]\r\n\r\nThese facts, and Mr. Poulton's evidence that some larvae rejected by\r\nlizards at first will be eaten if the lizards are very hungry, show that\r\nthere are differences in the amount of the distastefulness, and render\r\nit probable that if other food were wanting many of these conspicuous\r\ninsects would be eaten. It is the abundance of the eatable kinds that\r\ngives value to the inedibility of the smaller number; and this is\r\nprobably the reason why so many insects rely on protective colouring\r\nrather than on the acquisition of any kind of defensive weapons. In the\r\nlong run the powers of attack and defence must balance each other. Hence\r\nwe see that even the powerful stings of bees and wasps only protect them\r\nagainst some enemies, since a tribe of birds, the bee-eaters, have been\r\ndeveloped which feed upon them, and some frogs and lizards do so\r\noccasionally.\r\n\r\nThe preceding outline will sufficiently explain the characteristics of\r\n\"warning coloration\" and the end it serves in nature. There are many\r\nother curious modifications of it, but these will be best appreciated\r\nafter we have discussed the remarkable phenomenon of \"mimicry,\" which is\r\nbound up with and altogether depends upon \"warning colour,\" and is in\r\nsome cases the chief indication we have of the possession of some\r\noffensive weapon to secure the safety of the species imitated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mimicry._\r\n\r\nThis term has been given to a form of protective resemblance, in which\r\none species so closely resembles another in external form and colouring\r\nas to be mistaken for it, although the two may not be really allied and\r\noften belong to distinct families or orders. One creature seems\r\ndisguised in order to be made like another; hence the terms \"mimic\" and\r\nmimicry, which imply no voluntary action on the part of the imitator. It\r\nhas long been known that such resemblances do occur, as, for example,\r\nthe clear-winged moths of the families Sesiidae and Aegeriidae, many of\r\nwhich resemble bees, wasps, ichneumons, or saw-flies, and have received\r\nnames expressive of the resemblance; and the parasitic flies (Volucella)\r\nwhich closely resemble bees, on whose larvae the larvae of the flies\r\nfeed.\r\n\r\nThe great bulk of such cases remained, however, unnoticed, and the\r\nsubject was looked upon as one of the inexplicable curiosities of\r\nnature, till Mr. Bates studied the phenomenon among the butterflies of\r\nthe Amazon, and, on his return home, gave the first rational explanation\r\nof it.[98] The facts are, briefly, these. Everywhere in that fertile\r\nregion for the entomologist the brilliantly coloured Heliconidae abound,\r\nwith all the characteristics which I have already referred to when\r\ndescribing them as illustrative of \"warning coloration.\" But along with\r\nthem other butterflies were occasionally captured, which, though often\r\nmistaken for them, on account of their close resemblance in form,\r\ncolour, and mode of flight, were found on examination to belong to a\r\nvery distinct family, the Pieridae. Mr. Bates notices fifteen distinct\r\nspecies of Pieridae, belonging to the genera Leptalis and Euterpe, each\r\nof which closely imitates some one species of Heliconidae, inhabiting\r\nthe same region and frequenting the same localities. It must be\r\nremembered that the two families are altogether distinct in structure.\r\nThe larvae of the Heliconidae are tubercled or spined, the pupae\r\nsuspended head downwards, and the imago has imperfect forelegs in the\r\nmale; while the larvae of the Pieridae are smooth, the pupae are\r\nsuspended with a brace to keep the head erect, and the forefeet are\r\nfully developed in both sexes. These differences are as large and as\r\nimportant as those between pigs and sheep, or between swallows and\r\nsparrows; while English entomologists will best understand the case by\r\nsupposing that a species of Pieris in this country was coloured and\r\nshaped like a small tortoise-shell, while another species on the\r\nContinent was equally like a Camberwell beauty--so like in both cases\r\nas to be mistaken when on the wing, and the difference only to be\r\ndetected by close examination. As an example of the resemblance,\r\nwoodcuts are given of one pair in which the colours are simple, being\r\nolive, yellow, and black, while the very distinct neuration of the wings\r\nand form of the head and body can be easily seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Methona psidii (Heliconidae). Leptalis orise\r\n(Pieridae).]\r\n\r\nBesides these Pieridae, Mr. Bates found four true Papilios, seven\r\nErycinidae, three Castnias (a genus of day-flying moths), and fourteen\r\nspecies of diurnal Bombycidae, all imitating some species of Heliconidae\r\nwhich inhabited the same district; and it is to be especially noted that\r\nnone of these insects were so abundant as the Heliconidae they\r\nresembled, generally they were far less common, so that Mr. Bates\r\nestimated the proportion in some cases as not one to a thousand. Before\r\ngiving an account of the numerous remarkable cases of mimicry in other\r\nparts of the world, and between various groups of insects and of higher\r\nanimals, it will be well to explain briefly the use and purport of the\r\nphenomenon, and also the mode by which it has been brought about.\r\n\r\n\r\n_How Mimicry has been Produced._\r\n\r\nThe fact has been now established that the Heliconidae possess an\r\noffensive odour and taste, which lead to their being almost entirely\r\nfree from attack by insectivorous creatures; they possess a peculiar\r\nform and mode of flight, and do not seek concealment; while their\r\ncolours--although very varied, ranging from deep blue-black, with white,\r\nyellow, or vivid red bands and spots, to the most delicate\r\nsemitransparent wings adorned with pale brown or yellow markings--are\r\nyet always very distinctive, and unlike those of all the other families\r\nof butterflies in the same country. It is, therefore, clear that if any\r\nother butterflies in the same region, which are eatable and suffer great\r\npersecution from insectivorous animals, should come to resemble any of\r\nthese uneatable species so closely as to be mistaken for them by their\r\nenemies, they will obtain thereby immunity from persecution. This is the\r\nobvious and sufficient reason why the imitation is useful, and therefore\r\nwhy it occurs in nature. We have now to explain how it has probably been\r\nbrought about, and also why a still larger number of persecuted groups\r\nhave not availed themselves of this simple means of protection.\r\n\r\nFrom the great abundance of the Heliconidae[99] all over tropical\r\nAmerica, the vast number of their genera and species, and their marked\r\ndistinctions from all other butterflies, it follows that they constitute\r\na group of high antiquity, which in the course of ages has become more\r\nand more specialised, and owing to its peculiar advantages has now\r\nbecome a dominant and aggressive race. But when they first arose from\r\nsome ancestral species or group which, owing to the food of the larvae\r\nor some other cause, possessed disagreeable juices that caused them to\r\nbe disliked by the usual enemies of their kind, they were in all\r\nprobability not very different either in form or coloration from many\r\nother butterflies. They would at that time be subject to repeated\r\nattacks by insect-eaters, and, even if finally rejected, would often\r\nreceive a fatal injury. Hence arose the necessity for some\r\ndistinguishing mark, by which the devourers of butterflies in general\r\nmight learn that these particular butterflies were uneatable; and every\r\nvariation leading to such distinction, whether by form, colour, or mode\r\nof flight, was preserved and accumulated by natural selection, till the\r\nancestral Heliconoids became well distinguished from eatable\r\nbutterflies, and thenceforth comparatively free from persecution. Then\r\nthey had a good time of it. They acquired lazy habits, and flew about\r\nslowly. They increased abundantly and spread all over the country, their\r\nlarvae feeding on many plants and acquiring different habits; while the\r\nbutterflies themselves varied greatly, and colour being useful rather\r\nthan injurious to them, gradually diverged into the many coloured and\r\nbeautifully varied forms we now behold.\r\n\r\nBut, during the early stages of this process, some of the Pieridae,\r\ninhabiting the same district, happened to be sufficiently like some of\r\nthe Heliconidae to be occasionally mistaken for them. These, of course,\r\nsurvived while their companions were devoured. Those among their\r\ndescendants that were still more like Heliconidae again survived, and at\r\nlength the imitation would become tolerably perfect. Thereafter, as the\r\nprotected group diverged into distinct species of many different\r\ncolours, the imitative group would occasionally be able to follow it\r\nwith similar variations,--a process that is going on now, for Mr. Bates\r\ninforms us that in each fresh district he visited he found closely\r\nallied representative species or varieties of Heliconidae, and along\r\nwith them species of Leptalis (Pieridae), which had varied in the same\r\nway so as still to be exact imitations. But this process of imitation\r\nwould be subject to check by the increasing acuteness of birds and other\r\nanimals which, whenever the eatable Leptalis became numerous, would\r\nsurely find them out, and would then probably attack both these and\r\ntheir friends the Heliconidae in order to devour the former and reject\r\nthe latter. The Pieridae would, however, usually be less numerous,\r\nbecause their larvae are often protectively coloured and therefore\r\nedible, while the larvae of the Heliconidae are adorned with warning\r\ncolours, spines, or tubercles, and are uneatable. It seems probable that\r\nthe larvae and pupae of the Heliconidae were the first to acquire the\r\nprotective distastefulness, both because in this stage they are more\r\ndefenceless and more liable to fatal injury, and also because we now\r\nfind many instances in which the larvae are distasteful while the\r\nperfect insects are eatable, but I believe none in which the reverse is\r\nthe case. The larvae of the Pieridae are now beginning to acquire\r\noffensive juices, but have not yet obtained the corresponding\r\nconspicuous colours; while the perfect insects remain eatable, except\r\nperhaps in some Eastern groups, the under sides of whose wings are\r\nbrilliantly coloured although this is the part which is exposed when at\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that if a large majority of the larvae of Lepidoptera, as\r\nwell as the perfect insects, acquired these distasteful properties, so\r\nas seriously to diminish the food supply of insectivorous and nestling\r\nbirds, these latter would be forced by necessity to acquire\r\ncorresponding tastes, and to eat with pleasure what some of them now eat\r\nonly under pressure of hunger; and variation and natural selection would\r\nsoon bring about this change.\r\n\r\nMany writers have denied the possibility of such wonderful resemblances\r\nbeing produced by the accumulation of fortuitous variations, but if the\r\nreader will call to mind the large amount of variability that has been\r\nshown to exist in all organisms, the exceptional power of rapid increase\r\npossessed by insects, and the tremendous struggle for existence always\r\ngoing on, the difficulty will vanish, especially when we remember that\r\nnature has the same fundamental groundwork to act upon in the two\r\ngroups, general similarity of forms, wings of similar texture and\r\noutline, and probably some original similarity of colour and marking.\r\nYet there is evidently considerable difficulty in the process, or with\r\nthese great resources at her command nature would have produced more of\r\nthese mimicking forms than she has done. One reason of this deficiency\r\nprobably is, that the imitators, being always fewer in number, have not\r\nbeen able to keep pace with the variations of the much more numerous\r\nimitated form; another reason may be the ever-increasing acuteness of\r\nthe enemies, which have again and again detected the imposture and\r\nexterminated the feeble race before it has had time to become further\r\nmodified. The result of this growing acuteness of enemies has been, that\r\nthose mimics that now survive exhibit, as Mr. Bates well remarks, \"a\r\npalpably intentional likeness that is perfectly staggering,\" and also\r\n\"that those features of the portrait are most attended to by nature\r\nwhich produce the most effective deception when the insects are seen in\r\nnature.\" No one, in fact, can understand the perfection of the imitation\r\nwho has not seen these species in their native wilds. So complete is it\r\nin general effect that in almost every box of butterflies, brought from\r\ntropical America by amateurs, are to be found some species of the\r\nmimicking Pieridae, Erycinidae, or moths, and the mimicked Heliconidae,\r\nplaced together under the impression that they are the same species. Yet\r\nmore extraordinary, it sometimes deceives the very insects themselves.\r\nMr. Trimen states that the male Danais chrysippus is sometimes deceived\r\nby the female Diadema bolina which mimics that species. Dr. Fritz\r\nMüller, writing from Brazil to Professor Meldola, says, \"One of the most\r\ninteresting of our mimicking butterflies is Leptalis melite. The female\r\nalone of this species imitates one of our common white Pieridae, which\r\nshe copies so well that even her own male is often deceived; for I have\r\nrepeatedly seen the male pursuing the mimicked species, till, after\r\nclosely approaching and becoming aware of his error, he suddenly\r\nreturned.\"[100] This is evidently not a case of true mimicry, since the\r\nspecies imitated is not protected; but it may be that the less abundant\r\nLeptalis is able to mingle with the female Pieridae and thus obtain\r\npartial immunity from attack. Mr. Kirby of the insect department of the\r\nBritish Museum informs me that there are several species of South\r\nAmerican Pieridae which the female Leptalis melite very nearly\r\nresembles. The case, however, is interesting as showing that the\r\nbutterflies are themselves deceived by a resemblance which is not so\r\ngreat as that of some mimicking species.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Examples of Mimicry among Lepidoptera._\r\n\r\nIn tropical Asia, and eastward to the Pacific Islands, the Danaidae take\r\nthe place of the Heliconidae of America, in their abundance, their\r\nconspicuousness, their slow flight, and their being the subjects of\r\nmimicry. They exist under three principal forms or genera. The genus\r\nEuploea is the most abundant both in species and individuals, and\r\nconsists of fine broad-winged butterflies of a glossy or metallic\r\nblue-black colour, adorned with pure white, or rich blue, or dusky\r\nmarkings situated round the margins of the wings. Danais has generally\r\nmore lengthened wings, of a semitransparent greenish or a rich brown\r\ncolour, with radial or marginal pale spots; while the fine Hestias are\r\nof enormous size, of a papery or semitransparent white colour, with\r\ndusky or black spots and markings. Each of these groups is mimicked by\r\nvarious species of the genus Papilio, usually with such accuracy that it\r\nis impossible to distinguish them on the wing.[101] Several species of\r\nDiadema, a genus of butterflies allied to our Vanessas, also mimic\r\nspecies of Danais, but in this case the females only are affected, a\r\nsubject which will be discussed in another chapter.\r\n\r\nAnother protected group in the Eastern tropics is that of the beautiful\r\nday-flying moths forming the family Agaristidae. These are usually\r\nadorned with the most brilliant colours or conspicuous markings, they\r\nfly slowly in forests among the butterflies and other diurnal insects,\r\nand their great abundance sufficiently indicates their possession of\r\nsome distastefulness which saves them from attack. Under these\r\nconditions we may expect to find other moths which are not so protected\r\nimitating them, and this is the case. One of the common and wide-ranging\r\nspecies (Opthalmis lincea), found in the islands from Amboyna to New\r\nIreland, is mimicked in a wonderful manner by one of the Liparidae (the\r\nfamily to which our common \"tussock\" and \"vapourer\" moths belong). This\r\nis a new species collected at Amboyna during the voyage of the\r\n_Challenger_, and has been named Artaxa simulans. Both insects are\r\nblack, with the apex of the fore wings ochre coloured, and the outer\r\nhalf of the hind wings bright orange. The accompanying woodcuts (for the\r\nuse of which I am indebted to Mr. John Murray of the _Challenger_\r\nOffice) well exhibit their striking resemblance to each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--Opthalmis lincea (Agaristidae). Artaxa simulans\r\n(Liparidae).]\r\n\r\nIn Africa exactly similar phenomena recur, species of Papilio and of\r\nDiadema mimicking Danaidae or Acraeidae with the most curious accuracy.\r\nMr. Trimen, who studied this subject in South Africa, has recorded eight\r\nspecies or varieties of Diadema, and eight of Papilio, which each mimic\r\nsome species of Danais; while eight species or varieties of Panopaea\r\n(another genus of Nymphalidae), three of Melanitis (Eurytelidae), and\r\ntwo of Papilio, resemble with equal accuracy some species of\r\nAcraea.[102] He has also independently observed the main facts on which\r\nthe explanation of the phenomenon rests,--the unpleasant odour of the\r\nDanais and Acraea, extending to their larvae and pupae; their great\r\nabundance, slow flight, and disregard of concealment; and he states that\r\nwhile lizards, mantidae, and dragonflies all hunt butterflies, and the\r\nrejected wings are to be found abundantly at some of their\r\nfeeding-places, those of the two genera Danais and Acraea were never\r\namong them.\r\n\r\nThe two groups of the great genus Papilio (the true swallow-tailed\r\nbutterflies) which have been already referred to as having the special\r\ncharacteristics of uneatable insects, have also their imitators in other\r\ngroups; and thus, the belief in their inedibility--derived mainly from\r\ntheir style of warning coloration and their peculiar habits--is\r\nconfirmed. In South America, several species of the \"Aeneas\" group of\r\nthese butterflies are mimicked by Pieridae and by day-flying moths of\r\nthe genera Castnia and Pericopis. In the East, Papilio hector, P.\r\ndiphilus, and P. liris, all belonging to the inedible group, are\r\nmimicked by the females of other species of Papilio belonging to very\r\ndistinct groups; while in Northern India and China, many fine day-flying\r\nmoths (Epicopeia) have acquired the strange forms and peculiar colours\r\nof some of the large inedible Papilios of the same regions.\r\n\r\nIn North America, the large and handsome Danais archippus, with rich\r\nreddish-brown wings, is very common; and it is closely imitated by\r\nLimenitis misippus, a butterfly allied to our \"white admiral,\" but which\r\nhas acquired a colour quite distinct from that of the great bulk of its\r\nallies. In the same country there is a still more interesting case. The\r\nbeautiful dark bronzy green butterfly, Papilio philenor, is inedible\r\nboth in larva and perfect insect, and it is mimicked by the equally dark\r\nLimenitis ursula. There is also in the Southern and Western States a\r\ndark female form of the yellow Papilio turnus, which in all probability\r\nobtains protection from its general resemblance to P. philenor. Mr. W.H.\r\nEdwards has found, by extensive experiment, that both the dark and\r\nyellow females produce their own kinds, with very few exceptions; and he\r\nthinks that the dark form has the advantage in the more open regions and\r\nin the prairies, where insectivorous birds abound. But in open country\r\nthe dark form would be quite as conspicuous as the yellow form, if not\r\nmore so, so that the resemblance to an inedible species would be there\r\nmore needed.[103]\r\n\r\nThe only probable case of mimicry in this country is that of the moth,\r\nDiaphora mendica, whose female only is white, while the larva is of\r\nprotective colours, and therefore almost certainly edible. A much more\r\nabundant moth, of about the same size and appearing about the same time,\r\nis Spilosoma menthrasti, also white, but in this case both it and its\r\nlarva have been proved to be inedible. The white colour of the female\r\nDiaphora, although it must be very conspicuous at night, may, therefore,\r\nhave been acquired in order to resemble the uneatable Spilosoma, and\r\nthus gain some protection.[104]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mimicry among Protected (Uneatable) Genera._\r\n\r\nBefore giving some account of the numerous other cases of warning\r\ncolours and of mimicry that occur in the animal kingdom, it will be well\r\nto notice a curious phenomenon which long puzzled entomologists, but\r\nwhich has at length received a satisfactory explanation.\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto considered, that mimicry could only occur when a\r\ncomparatively scarce and much persecuted species obtained protection by\r\nits close external resemblance to a much more abundant uneatable species\r\ninhabiting its own district; and this rule undoubtedly prevails among\r\nthe great majority of mimicking species all over the world. But Mr.\r\nBates also found a number of pairs of species of different genera of\r\nHeliconidae, which resembled each other quite as closely as did the\r\nother mimicking species he has described; and since all these insects\r\nappear to be equally protected by their inedibility, and to be equally\r\nfree from persecution, it was not easy to see why this curious\r\nresemblance existed, or how it had been brought about. That it is not\r\ndue to close affinity is shown by the fact that the resemblance occurs\r\nmost frequently between the two distinct sub-families into which (as Mr.\r\nBates first pointed out) the Heliconidae are naturally divided on\r\naccount of very important structural differences. One of these\r\nsub-families (the true Heliconinae) consists of two genera only,\r\nHeliconius and Eueides, the other (the Danaoid Heliconinae) of no less\r\nthan sixteen genera; and, in the instances of mimicry we are now\r\ndiscussing, one of the pairs or triplets that resemble each other is\r\nusually a species of the large and handsome genus Heliconius, the others\r\nbeing species of the genera Mechanitis, Melinaea, or Tithorea, though\r\nseveral species of other Danaoid genera also imitate each other. The\r\nfollowing lists will give some idea of the number of these curious\r\nimitative forms, and of their presence in every part of the Neotropical\r\narea. The bracketed species are those that resemble each other so\r\nclosely that the difference is not perceptible when they are on the\r\nwing.\r\n\r\nIn the Lower Amazon region are found--\r\n\r\n\r\n    { Heliconius sylvana.\r\n    { Melinaea egina.\r\n\r\n    { Heliconius numata.\r\n    { Melinaea mneme.\r\n    { Tithorea harmonia.\r\n\r\n    { Methona psidii.\r\n    { Thyridia ino.\r\n\r\n    { Ceratina ninonia.\r\n    { Melinaea mnasias.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Central America are found--\r\n\r\n\r\n              { Heliconius zuleika.\r\n    Nicaragua { Melinaea hezia.\r\n              { Mechanitis sp.\r\n\r\n              { Heliconius formosus.\r\n              { Tithorea penthias.\r\n\r\n    Guatemala { Heliconius telchina.\r\n              { Melinaea imitata.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Upper Amazon region--\r\n\r\n\r\n    { Heliconius pardalinus.\r\n    { Melinaea pardalis.\r\n\r\n    { Heliconius aurora.\r\n    { Melinaea lucifer.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn New Grenada--\r\n\r\n\r\n    { Heliconius ismenius.\r\n    { Melinaea messatis.\r\n\r\n    { Heliconius messene.\r\n    { Melinaea mesenina.\r\n    { (?)

Wings of\r\nThyridia megisto, female.]\r\n\r\nThe figures above of the fore and hind wings of two of these mimicking\r\nspecies, from Dr. Fritz Müller's original paper in _Kosmos_, will serve\r\nto show the considerable amount of difference, in the important\r\ncharacter of the neuration of the wings, between these butterflies,\r\nwhich really belong to very distinct and not at all closely allied\r\ngenera. Other important characters are--(1) The existence of a small\r\nbasal cell in the hind wings of Ituna which is wanting in Thyridia; (2)\r\nthe division of the cell between the veins 1_b_ and 2 of the hind wings\r\nin the former genus, while it is undivided in the latter; and (3) the\r\nexistence in Thyridia of scent-producing tufts of hair on the upper edge\r\nof the hind wing, while in Ituna these are wanting; but in place of them\r\nare extensible processes at the end of the abdomen, also emitting a\r\npowerful scent. These differences characterise two marked subdivisions\r\nof the Danaoid Heliconinae, each containing several distinct genera; and\r\nthese subdivisions are further distinguished by very different forms of\r\nlarvae, that to which Ituna belongs having from two to four long\r\nthreadlike tentacles on the back, while in that containing Thyridia\r\nthese are always absent. The former usually feed on Asclepiadeae, the\r\nlatter on Solanaceae or Scrophulariaceae.\r\n\r\nThe two species figured, though belonging to such distinct and even\r\nremote genera, have acquired almost identical tints and markings so as\r\nto be deceptively alike. The surface of the wings is, in both,\r\ntransparent yellowish, with black transverse bands and white marginal\r\nspots, while both have similar black-and white-marked bodies and long\r\nyellow antennae. Dr. Müller states that they both show a preference for\r\nthe same flowers growing on the edges of the forest paths.[105]\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to give the explanation of these curious\r\nsimilarities, which have remained a complete puzzle for twenty years.\r\nMr. Bates, when first describing them, suggested that they might be due\r\nto some form of parallel variation dependent on climatic influences; and\r\nI myself adduced other cases of coincident local modifications of\r\ncolour, which did not appear to be explicable by any form of\r\nmimicry.[106] But we neither of us hit upon the simple explanation given\r\nby Dr. Fritz Müller in 1879.\r\n\r\nHis theory is founded on the assumed, but probable, fact, that\r\ninsect-eating birds only learn by experience to distinguish the edible\r\nfrom the inedible butterflies, and in doing so necessarily sacrifice a\r\ncertain number of the latter. The quantity of insectivorous birds in\r\ntropical America is enormous; and the number of young birds which every\r\nyear have to learn wisdom by experience, as regards the species of\r\nbutterflies to be caught or to be avoided, is so great that the\r\nsacrifice of life of the inedible species must be considerable, and, to\r\na comparatively weak or scarce species, of vital importance. The number\r\nthus sacrificed will be fixed by the quantity of young birds, and by the\r\nnumber of experiences requisite to cause them to avoid the inedible\r\nspecies for the future, and not at all by the numbers of individuals of\r\nwhich each species consists. Hence, if two species are so much alike as\r\nto be mistaken for one another, the fixed number annually sacrificed by\r\ninexperienced birds will be divided between them, and both will benefit.\r\nBut if the two species are very unequal in numbers, the benefit will be\r\ncomparatively slight for the more abundant species, but very great for\r\nthe rare one. To the latter it may make all the difference between\r\nsafety and destruction.\r\n\r\nTo give a rough numerical example. Let us suppose that in a given\r\nlimited district there are two species of Heliconidae, one consisting of\r\nonly 1000, the other of 100,000 individuals, and that the quota required\r\nannually in the same district for the instruction of young insectivorous\r\nbirds is 500. By the larger species this loss will be hardly felt; to\r\nthe smaller it will mean the most dreadful persecution resulting in a\r\nloss of half the total population. But, let the two species become\r\nsuperficially alike, so that the birds see no difference between them.\r\nThe quota of 500 will now be taken from a combined population of 101,000\r\nbutterflies, and if proportionate numbers of each suffer, then the weak\r\nspecies will only lose five individuals instead of 500 as it did before.\r\nNow we know that the different species of Heliconidae are not equally\r\nabundant, some being quite rare; so that the benefit to be derived in\r\nthese latter cases would be very important. A slight inferiority in\r\nrapidity of flight or in powers of eluding attack might also be a cause\r\nof danger to an inedible species of scanty numbers, and in this case too\r\nthe being merged in another much more abundant species, by similarity\r\nof external appearance, would be an advantage.\r\n\r\nThe question of fact remains. Do young birds pursue and capture these\r\ndistasteful butterflies till they have learned by bitter experience what\r\nspecies to avoid? On this point Dr. Müller has fortunately been able to\r\nobtain some direct evidence, by capturing several Acraeas and\r\nHeliconidae which had evidently been seized by birds but had afterwards\r\nescaped, as they had pieces torn out of the wing, sometimes\r\nsymmetrically out of both wings, showing that the insect had been seized\r\nwhen at rest and with the two pairs of wings in contact. There is,\r\nhowever, a general impression that this knowledge is hereditary, and\r\ndoes not need to be acquired by young birds; in support of which view\r\nMr. Jenner Weir states that his birds always disregarded inedible\r\ncaterpillars. When, day by day, he threw into his aviary various larvae,\r\nthose which were edible were eaten immediately, those which were\r\ninedible were no more noticed than if a pebble had been thrown before\r\nthe birds.\r\n\r\nThe cases, however, are not strictly comparable. The birds were not\r\nyoung birds of the first year; and, what is more important, edible\r\nlarvae have a comparatively simple coloration, being always brown or\r\ngreen and smooth. Uneatable larvae, on the other hand, comprise all that\r\nare of conspicuous colours and are hairy or spiny. But with butterflies\r\nthere is no such simplicity of contrast. The eatable butterflies\r\ncomprise not only brown or white species, but hundreds of Nymphalidae,\r\nPapilionidae, Lycaenidae, etc., which are gaily coloured and of an\r\nimmense variety of patterns. The colours and patterns of the inedible\r\nkinds are also greatly varied, while they are often equally gay; and it\r\nis quite impossible to suppose that any amount of instinct or inherited\r\nhabit (if such a thing exists) could enable young insectivorous birds to\r\ndistinguish all the species of one kind from all those of the other.\r\nThere is also some evidence to show that animals do learn by experience\r\nwhat to eat and what to avoid. Mr. Poulton was assured by Rev. G.J.\r\nBursch that very young chickens peck at insects which they afterwards\r\navoid. Lizards, too, often seized larvae which they were unable to eat\r\nand ultimately rejected.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Heliconidae present, on the whole, many varieties of\r\ncoloration and pattern, yet, in proportion to the number of distinct\r\nspecies in each district, the types of coloration are few and very well\r\nmarked, and thus it becomes easier for a bird or other animal to learn\r\nthat all belonging to such types are uneatable. This must be a decided\r\nadvantage to the family in question, because, not only do fewer\r\nindividuals of each species need to be sacrificed in order that their\r\nenemies may learn the lesson of their inedibility, but they are more\r\neasily recognised at a distance, and thus escape even pursuit. There is\r\nthus a kind of mimicry between closely allied species as well as between\r\nspecies of distinct genera, all tending to the same beneficial end. This\r\nmay be seen in the four or five distinct species of the genus Heliconius\r\nwhich all have the same peculiar type of coloration--a yellow band\r\nacross the upper wings and radiating red stripes on the lower,--and are\r\nall found in the same forests of the Lower Amazon; in the numerous very\r\nsimilar species of Ithomia with transparent wings, found in every\r\nlocality of the same region; and in the very numerous species of Papilio\r\nof the \"Aeneas\" group, all having a similar style of marking, the\r\nresemblance being especially close in the females. The very uniform type\r\nof colouring of the blue-black Euplaeas and of the fulvous Acraeas is of\r\nthe same character.[107] In all these cases the similarity of the allied\r\nspecies is so great, that, when they are on the wing at some distance\r\noff, it is difficult to distinguish one species from another. But this\r\nclose external resemblance is not always a sign of very near affinity;\r\nfor minute examination detects differences in the form and scalloping of\r\nthe wings, in the markings on the body, and in those on the under\r\nsurface of the wings, which do not usually characterise the closest\r\nallies. It is to be further noted, that the presence of groups of very\r\nsimilar species of the same genus, in one locality, is not at all a\r\ncommon phenomenon among unprotected groups. Usually the species of a\r\ngenus found in one locality are each well marked and belong to somewhat\r\ndistinct types, while the closely allied forms--those that require\r\nminute examination to discriminate them as distinct species--are most\r\ngenerally found in separate areas, and are what are termed\r\nrepresentative forms.\r\n\r\nThe extension we have now given to the theory of mimicry is important,\r\nsince it enables us to explain a much wider range of colour phenomena\r\nthan those which were first imputed to mimicry. It is in the richest\r\nbutterfly region in the world--the Amazon valley--that we find the most\r\nabundant evidence of the three distinct sets of facts, all depending on\r\nthe same general principle. The form of mimicry first elucidated by Mr.\r\nBates is characterised by the presence in each locality of certain\r\nbutterflies, or other insects, themselves edible and belonging to edible\r\ngroups, which derived protection from having acquired a deceptive\r\nresemblance to some of the inedible butterflies in the same localities,\r\nwhich latter were believed to be wholly free from the attacks of\r\ninsectivorous birds. Then came the extension of the principle, by Dr. F.\r\nMüller, to the case of species of distinct genera of the inedible\r\nbutterflies resembling each other quite as closely as in the former\r\ncases, and like them always found in the same localities. They derive\r\nmutual benefit from becoming, in appearance, one species, from which a\r\ncertain toll is taken annually to teach the young insectivorous birds\r\nthat they are uneatable. Even when the two or more species are\r\napproximately equal in numbers, they each derive a considerable benefit\r\nfrom thus combining their forces; but when one of the species is scarce\r\nor verging on extinction, the benefit becomes exceedingly great, being,\r\nin fact, exactly apportioned to the need of the species.\r\n\r\nThe third extension of the same principle explains the grouping of\r\nallied species of the same genera of inedible butterflies into sets,\r\neach having a distinct type of coloration, and each consisting of a\r\nnumber of species which can hardly be distinguished on the wing. This\r\nmust be useful exactly in the same way as in the last case, since it\r\ndivides the inevitable toll to insectivorous birds and other animals\r\namong a number of species. It also explains the fact of the great\r\nsimilarity of many species of inedible insects in the same locality--a\r\nsimilarity which does not obtain to anything like the same extent among\r\nthe edible species. The explanation of the various phenomena of\r\nresemblance and mimicry, presented by the distasteful butterflies, may\r\nnow be considered tolerably complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mimicry in other Orders of Insects._\r\n\r\nA very brief sketch of these phenomena will be given, chiefly to show\r\nthat the same principle prevails throughout nature, and that, wherever a\r\nrather extensive group is protected, either by distastefulness or\r\noffensive weapons, there are usually some species of edible and\r\ninoffensive groups that gain protection by imitating them. It has been\r\nalready stated that the Telephoridae, Lampyridae, and other families of\r\nsoft-winged beetles, are distasteful; and as they abound in all parts of\r\nthe world, and especially in the tropics, it is not surprising that\r\ninsects of many other groups should imitate them. This is especially the\r\ncase with the longicorn beetles, which are much persecuted by\r\ninsectivorous birds; and everywhere in tropical regions some of these\r\nare to be found so completely disguised as to be mistaken for species of\r\nthe protected groups. Numbers of these imitations have been already\r\nrecorded by Mr. Bates and myself, but I will here refer to a few others.\r\n\r\nIn the recently published volumes on the Longicorn and Malacoderm\r\nbeetles of Central America[108] there are numbers of beautifully\r\ncoloured figures of the new species; and on looking over them we are\r\nstruck by the curious resemblance of some of the Longicorns to species\r\nof the Malacoderm group. In some cases we discover perfect mimics, and\r\non turning to the descriptions we always find these pairs to come from\r\nthe same locality. Thus the Otheostethus melanurus, one of the\r\nPrionidae, imitates the malacoderm, Lucidota discolor, in form, peculiar\r\ncoloration, and size, and both are found at Chontales in Nicaragua, the\r\nspecies mimicked having, however, as is usual, a wider range. The\r\ncurious and very rare little longicorn, Tethlimmena aliena, quite unlike\r\nits nearest allies in the same country, is an exact copy on a somewhat\r\nsmaller scale of a malacoderm, Lygistopterus amabilis, both found at\r\nChontales. The pretty longicorn, Callia albicornis, closely resembles\r\ntwo species of malacoderms (Silis chalybeipennis and Colyphus\r\nsignaticollis), all being small beetles with red head and thorax and\r\nbright blue elytra, and all three have been found at Panama. Many other\r\nspecies of Callia also resemble other malacoderms; and the longicorn\r\ngenus Lycidola has been named from its resemblance to various species of\r\nthe Lycidae, one of the species here figured (Lycidola belti) being a\r\ngood mimic of Calopteron corrugatum and of several other allied species,\r\nall being of about the same size and found at Chontales. In these cases,\r\nand in most others, the longicorn beetles have lost the general form and\r\naspect of their allies to take on the appearance of a distinct tribe.\r\nSome other groups of beetles, as the Elateridae and Eucnemidae, also\r\ndeceptively mimic malacoderms.\r\n\r\nWasps and bees are often closely imitated by insects of other orders.\r\nMany longicorn beetles in the tropics exactly mimic wasps, bees, or\r\nants. In Borneo a large black wasp, whose wings have a broad white patch\r\nnear the apex (Mygnimia aviculus), is closely imitated by a heteromerous\r\nbeetle (Coloborhombus fasciatipennis), which, contrary to the general\r\nhabit of beetles, keeps its wings expanded in order to show the white\r\npatch on their apex, the wing-coverts being reduced to small oval\r\nscales, as shown in the figure. This is a most remarkable instance of\r\nmimicry, because the beetle has had to acquire so many characters which\r\nare unknown among its allies (except in another species from Java)--the\r\nexpanded wings, the white band on them, and the oval scale-like\r\nelytra.[109] Another remarkable case has been noted by Mr. Neville\r\nGoodman, in Egypt, where a common hornet (Vespa orientalis) is exactly\r\nimitated in colour, size, shape, attitude when at rest, and mode of\r\nflight, by a beetle of the genus Laphria.[110]\r\n\r\nThe tiger-beetles (Cicindelidae) are also the subjects of mimicry by\r\nmore harmless insects. In the Malay Islands I found a heteromerous\r\nbeetle which exactly resembled a Therates, both being found running on\r\nthe trunks of trees. A longicorn (Collyrodes Lacordairei) mimics\r\nCollyris, another genus of the same family; while in the Philippine\r\nIslands there is a cricket (Condylodeira tricondyloides), which so\r\nclosely resembles a tiger-beetle of the genus Tricondyla that the\r\nexperienced entomologist, Professor Westwood, at first placed it in his\r\ncabinet among those beetles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--Mygnimia aviculus (Wasp). Coloborhombus\r\nfasciatipennis (Beetle).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.\r\na. Doliops sp. (Longicorn)\r\n   mimics Pachyrhynchus orbifae, (b) (a hard curculio).\r\nc.

The exact correspondence of the\r\ncolours of the insects themselves renders the mimicry much more complete\r\nin nature than it appears in the above figures.]\r\n\r\nOne of the characters by which some beetles are protected is excessive\r\nhardness of the elytra and integuments. Several genera of weevils\r\n(Curculionidae) are thus saved from attack, and these are often mimicked\r\nby species of softer and more eatable groups. In South America, the\r\ngenus Heilipus is one of these hard groups, and both Mr. Bates and M.\r\nRoelofs, a Belgian entomologist, have noticed that species of other\r\ngenera exactly mimic them. So, in the Philippines, there is a group of\r\nCurculionidae, forming the genus Pachyrhynchus, in which all the species\r\nare adorned with the most brilliant metallic colours, banded and spotted\r\nin a curious manner, and are very smooth and hard. Other genera of\r\nCurculionidae (Desmidophorus, Alcides), which are usually very\r\ndifferently coloured, have species in the Philippines which mimic the\r\nPachyrhynchi; and there are also several longicorn beetles (Aprophata,\r\nDoliops, Acronia, and Agnia), which also mimic them. Besides these,\r\nthere are some longicorns and cetonias which reproduce the same colours\r\nand markings; and there is even a cricket (Scepastus pachyrhynchoides),\r\nwhich has taken on the form and peculiar coloration of these beetles in\r\norder to escape from enemies, which then avoid them as uneatable.[111]\r\nThe figures on the opposite page exhibit several other examples of these\r\nmimicking insects.\r\n\r\nInnumerable other cases of mimicry occur among tropical insects; but we\r\nmust now pass on to consider a few of the very remarkable, but much\r\nrarer instances, that are found among the higher animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mimicry among the Vertebrata._\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable cases yet known are those of certain\r\nharmless snakes which mimic poisonous species. The genus Elaps, in\r\ntropical America, consists of poisonous snakes which do not belong to\r\nthe viper family (in which are included the rattlesnakes and most of\r\nthose which are poisonous), and which do not possess the broad\r\ntriangular head which characterises the latter. They have a peculiar\r\nstyle of coloration, consisting of alternate rings of red and black, or\r\nred, black, and yellow, of different widths and grouped in various ways\r\nin the different species; and it is a style of coloration which does not\r\noccur in any other group of snakes in the world. But in the same regions\r\nare found three genera of harmless snakes, belonging to other families,\r\nsome few species of which mimic the poisonous Elaps, often so exactly\r\nthat it is with difficulty one can be distinguished from the other. Thus\r\nElaps fulvius in Guatemala is imitated by the harmless Pliocerus\r\nequalis; Elaps corallinus in Mexico is mimicked by the harmless\r\nHomalocranium semicinctum; and Elaps lemniscatus in Brazil is copied by\r\nOxyrhopus trigeminus; while in other parts of South America similar\r\ncases of mimicry occur, sometimes two harmless species imitating the\r\nsame poisonous snake.\r\n\r\nA few other instances of mimicry in this group have been recorded. There\r\nis in South Africa an egg-eating snake (Dasypeltis scaber), which has\r\nneither fangs nor teeth, yet it is very like the Berg adder (Clothos\r\natropos), and when alarmed renders itself still more like by flattening\r\nout its head and darting forward with a hiss as if to strike a foe.[112]\r\nDr. A.B. Meyer has also discovered that, while some species of the genus\r\nCallophis (belonging to the same family as the American Elaps) have\r\nlarge poison fangs, other species of the same genus have none; and that\r\none of the latter (C. gracilis) resembles a poisonous species (C.\r\nintestinalis) so closely, that only an exact comparison will discover\r\nthe difference of colour and marking. A similar kind of resemblance is\r\nsaid to exist between another harmless snake, Megaerophis flaviceps, and\r\nthe poisonous Callophis bivirgatus; and in both these cases the harmless\r\nsnake is less abundant than the poisonous one, as occurs in all examples\r\nof true mimicry.[113]\r\n\r\nIn the genus Elaps, above referred to, the very peculiar style of colour\r\nand marking is evidently a \"warning colour\" for the purpose of\r\nindicating to snake-eating birds and mammals that these species are\r\npoisonous; and this throws light on the long-disputed question of the\r\nuse of the rattle of the rattlesnake. This reptile is really both\r\nsluggish and timid, and is very easily captured by those who know its\r\nhabits. If gently tapped on the head with a stick, it will coil itself\r\nup and lie still, only raising its tail and rattling. It may then be\r\neasily caught. This shows that the rattle is a warning to its enemies\r\nthat it is dangerous to proceed to extremities; and the creature has\r\nprobably acquired this structure and habit because it frequents open or\r\nrocky districts where protective colour is needful to save it from being\r\npounced upon by buzzards or other snake-eaters. Quite parallel in\r\nfunction is the expanded hood of the Indian cobra, a poisonous snake\r\nwhich belongs also to the Elapidae. This is, no doubt, a warning to its\r\nfoes, not an attempt to terrify its prey; and the hood has been\r\nacquired, as in the case of the rattlesnake, because, protective\r\ncoloration being on the whole useful, some mark was required to\r\ndistinguish it from other protectively coloured, but harmless, snakes.\r\nBoth these species feed on active creatures capable of escaping if their\r\nenemy were visible at a moderate distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mimicry among Birds._\r\n\r\nThe varied forms and habits of birds do not favour the production among\r\nthem of the phenomena of warning colours or of mimicry; and the extreme\r\ndevelopment of their instincts and reasoning powers, as well as their\r\nactivity and their power of flight, usually afford them other means of\r\nevading their enemies. Yet there are a few imperfect, and one or two\r\nvery perfect cases of true mimicry to be found among them. The less\r\nperfect examples are those presented by several species of cuckoos, an\r\nexceedingly weak and defenceless group of birds. Our own cuckoo is, in\r\ncolour and markings, very like a sparrow-hawk. In the East, several of\r\nthe small black cuckoos closely resemble the aggressive drongo-shrikes\r\nof the same country, and the small metallic cuckoos are like glossy\r\nstarlings; while a large ground-cuckoo of Borneo (Carpococcyx radiatus)\r\nresembles one of the fine pheasants (Euplocamus) of the same country,\r\nboth in form and in its rich metallic colours.\r\n\r\nMore perfect cases of mimicry occur between some of the dull-coloured\r\norioles in the Malay Archipelago and a genus of large honey-suckers--the\r\nTropidorhynchi or \"Friar-birds.\" These latter are powerful and noisy\r\nbirds which go in small flocks. They have long, curved, and sharp beaks,\r\nand powerful grasping claws; and they are quite able to defend\r\nthemselves, often driving away crows and hawks which venture to approach\r\nthem too nearly. The orioles, on the other hand, are weak and timid\r\nbirds, and trust chiefly to concealment and to their retiring habits to\r\nescape persecution. In each of the great islands of the Austro-Malayan\r\nregion there is a distinct species of Tropidorhynchus, and there is\r\nalways along with it an oriole that exactly mimics it. All the\r\nTropidorhynchi have a patch of bare black skin round the eyes, and a\r\nruff of curious pale recurved feathers on the nape, whence their name of\r\nFriar-birds, the ruff being supposed to resemble the cowl of a friar.\r\nThese peculiarities are imitated in the orioles by patches of feathers\r\nof corresponding colours; while the different tints of the two species\r\nin each island are exactly the same. Thus in Bouru both are earthy\r\nbrown; in Ceram they are both washed with yellow ochre; in Timor the\r\nunder surface is pale and the throat nearly white, and Mr. H.O. Forbes\r\nhas recently discovered another pair in the island of Timor Laut. The\r\nclose resemblance of these several pairs of birds, of widely different\r\nfamilies, is quite comparable with that of many of the insects already\r\ndescribed. It is so close that the preserved specimens have even\r\ndeceived naturalists; for, in the great French work, _Voyage de\r\nl'Astrolabe_, the oriole of Bouru is actually described and figured as a\r\nhoney-sucker; and Mr. Forbes tells us that, when his birds were\r\nsubmitted to Dr. Sclater for description, the oriole and the\r\nhoney-sucker were, previous to close examination, considered to be the\r\nsame species.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Objections to the Theory of Mimicry._\r\n\r\nTo set forth adequately the varied and surprising facts of mimicry would\r\nneed a large and copiously illustrated volume; and no more interesting\r\nsubject could be taken up by a naturalist who has access to our great\r\ncollections and can devote the necessary time to search out the many\r\nexamples of mimicry that lie hidden in our museums. The brief sketch of\r\nthe subject that has been here given will, however, serve to indicate\r\nits nature, and to show the weakness of the objections that were at\r\nfirst made to it. It was urged that the action of \"like conditions,\"\r\nwith \"accidental resemblances\" and \"reversion to ancestral types,\" would\r\naccount for the facts. If, however, we consider the actual phenomena as\r\nhere set forth, and the very constant conditions under which they occur,\r\nwe shall see how utterly inadequate are these causes, either singly or\r\ncombined. These constant conditions are--\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. That the imitative species occur in the same area and occupy\r\n    the very same station as the imitated.\r\n\r\n    2. That the imitators are always the more defenceless.\r\n\r\n    3. That the imitators are always less numerous in individuals.\r\n\r\n    4. That the imitators differ from the bulk of their allies.\r\n\r\n    5. That the imitation, however minute, is _external_ and\r\n    _visible_ only, never extending to internal characters or to\r\n    such as do not affect the external appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese five characteristic features of mimicry show us that it is really\r\nan exceptional form of protective resemblance. Different species in the\r\nsame group of organisms may obtain protection in different ways: some by\r\na general resemblance to their environment; some by more exactly\r\nimitating the objects that surround them--bark, or leaf, or flower;\r\nwhile others again gain an equal protection by resembling some species\r\nwhich, from whatever cause, is almost as free from attack as if it were\r\na leaf or a flower. This immunity may depend on its being uneatable, or\r\ndangerous, or merely strong; and it is the resemblance to such creatures\r\nfor the purpose of sharing in their safety that constitutes mimicry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Concluding Remarks on Warning Colours and Mimicry._\r\n\r\nColours which have been acquired for the purpose of serving as a warning\r\nof inedibility, or of the possession of dangerous offensive weapons, are\r\nprobably more numerous than have been hitherto supposed; and, if so, we\r\nshall be able to explain a considerable amount of colour in nature for\r\nwhich no use has hitherto been conjectured. The brilliant and varied\r\ncolours of sea-anemones and of many coral animals will probably come\r\nunder this head, since we know that many of them possess the power of\r\nejecting stinging threads from various parts of their bodies which\r\nrender them quite uneatable to most animals. Mr. Gosse describes how, on\r\nputting an Anthea into a tank containing a half-grown bullhead (Cottus\r\nbubalis) which had not been fed for some time, the fish opened his mouth\r\nand sucked in the morsel, but instantly shot it out again. He then\r\nseized it a second time, and after rolling it about in his mouth for a\r\nmoment shot it out again, and then darted away to hide himself in a\r\nhole. Some tropical fishes, however, of the genera Tetrodon,\r\nPseudoscarus, Astracion, and a few others, seem to have acquired the\r\npower of feeding on corals and medusae; and the beautiful bands and\r\nspots and bright colours with which they are frequently adorned, may be\r\neither protective when feeding in the submarine coral groves, or may, in\r\nsome cases, be warning colours to show that they themselves are\r\npoisonous and uneatable.\r\n\r\nA remarkable illustration of the wide extension of warning colours, and\r\ntheir very definite purpose in nature, is afforded by what may now be\r\ntermed \"Mr. Belt's frog.\" Frogs in all parts of the world are, usually,\r\nprotectively coloured with greens or browns; and the little tree-frogs\r\nare either green like the leaves they rest upon, or curiously mottled to\r\nimitate bark or dead leaves. But there are a certain number of very\r\ngaily coloured frogs, and these do not conceal themselves as frogs\r\nusually do. Such was the small toad found by Darwin at Bahia Blanca,\r\nwhich was intense black and bright vermilion, and crawled about in the\r\nsunshine over dry sand-hills and arid plains. And in Nicaragua, Mr. Belt\r\nfound a little frog gorgeously dressed in a livery of red and blue,\r\nwhich did not attempt concealment and was very abundant, a combination\r\nof characters which convinced him that it was uneatable. He, therefore,\r\ntook a few specimens home with him and gave them to his fowls and ducks,\r\nbut none would touch them. At last, by throwing down pieces of meat, for\r\nwhich there was a great competition among the poultry, he managed to\r\nentice a young duck into snatching up one of the little frogs. Instead\r\nof swallowing it, however, the duck instantly threw it out of its mouth,\r\nand went about jerking its head as if trying to get rid of some\r\nunpleasant taste.[114]\r\n\r\nThe power of predicting what will happen in a given case is always\r\nconsidered to be a crucial test of a true theory, and if so, the theory\r\nof warning colours, and with it that of mimicry, must be held to be well\r\nestablished. Among the creatures which probably have warning colours as\r\na sign of inedibility are, the brilliantly coloured nudibranchiate\r\nmolluscs, those curious annelids the Nereis and the Aphrodite or\r\nsea-mouse, and many other marine animals. The brilliant colours of the\r\nscallops (Pecten) and some other bivalve shells are perhaps an\r\nindication of their hardness and consequent inedibility, as in the case\r\nof the hard beetles; and it is not improbable that some of the\r\nphosphorescent fishes and other marine organisms may, like the\r\nglow-worm, hold out their lamp as a warning to enemies.[115] In\r\nQueensland there is an exceedingly poisonous spider, whose bite will\r\nkill a dog, and cause severe illness with excruciating pain in man. It\r\nis black, with a bright vermilion patch on the middle of the body; and\r\nit is so well recognised by this conspicuous coloration that even the\r\nspider-hunting wasps avoid it.[116]\r\n\r\nLocusts and grasshoppers are generally of green protective tints, but\r\nthere are many tropical species most gaudily decorated with red, blue,\r\nand black colours. On the same general grounds as those by which Mr.\r\nBelt predicted the inedibility of his conspicuous frog, we might safely\r\npredict the same for these insects; but we have fortunately a proof that\r\nthey are so protected, since Mr. Charles Home states that one of the\r\nbright coloured Indian locusts was invariably rejected when offered to\r\nbirds and lizards.[117]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe examples now given lead us to the conclusion that colours acquired\r\nfor the purpose of serving as a danger-signal to enemies are very\r\nwidespread in nature, and, with the corresponding colours of the species\r\nwhich mimic them, furnish us with a rational explanation of a\r\nconsiderable portion of the coloration of animals which is outside the\r\nlimits of those colours that have been acquired for either protection or\r\nrecognition. There remains, however, another set of colours, chiefly\r\namong the higher animals, which, being connected with some of the most\r\ninteresting and most disputed questions in natural history, must be\r\ndiscussed in a separate chapter.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: _Nature_, vol. iii. p. 165.

These differences are found to have special relations\r\nwith the three classes of coloration above referred to, in many cases\r\nconfirming the explanation already given of their purport and use, and\r\nfurnishing us with important aid in formulating a general theory of\r\nanimal coloration.\r\n\r\nIn comparing the colours of the two sexes we find a perfect gradation,\r\nfrom absolute identity of colour up to such extreme difference that it\r\nis difficult to believe that the two forms can belong to the same\r\nspecies; and this diversity in the colours of the sexes does not bear\r\nany constant relation to affinity or systematic position. In both\r\ninsects and birds we find examples of complete identity and extreme\r\ndiversity of the sexes; and these differences occur sometimes in the\r\nsame tribe or family, and sometimes even in the same genus.\r\n\r\nIt is only among the higher and more active animals that sexual\r\ndifferences of colour acquire any prominence. In the mollusca the two\r\nsexes, when separated, are always alike in colour, and only very rarely\r\npresent slight differences in the form of the shell. In the extensive\r\ngroup of crustacea the two sexes as a rule are identical in colour,\r\nthough there are often differences in the form of the prehensile organs;\r\nbut in a very few cases there are differences of colour also. Thus, in a\r\nBrazilian species of shore-crab (Gelasimus) the female is grayish-brown,\r\nwhile in the male the posterior part of the cephalo-thorax is pure\r\nwhite, with the anterior part of a rich green. This colour is only\r\nacquired by the males when they become mature, and is liable to rapid\r\nchange in a few minutes to dusky tints.[118] In some of the freshwater\r\nfleas (Daphnoidae) the males are ornamented with red and blue spots,\r\nwhile in others similar colours occur in both sexes. In spiders also,\r\nthough as a rule the two sexes are alike in colour, there are a few\r\nexceptions, the males being ornamented with brilliant colours on the\r\nabdomen, while the female is dull coloured.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sexual Coloration in Insects._\r\n\r\nIt is only when we come to the winged insects that we find any large\r\namount of peculiarity in sexual coloration, and even here it is only\r\ndeveloped in certain orders. Flies (Diptera), field-bugs (Hemiptera),\r\ncicadas (Homoptera), and the grasshoppers, locusts, and crickets\r\n(Orthoptera) present very few and unimportant sexual differences of\r\ncolour; but the last two groups have special musical organs very fully\r\ndeveloped in the males of some of the species, and these no doubt enable\r\nthe sexes to discover and recognise each other. In some cases, however,\r\nwhen the female is protectively coloured, as in the well-known\r\nleaf-insects already referred to (p. 207), the male is smaller and much\r\nless protectively formed and coloured. In the bees and wasps\r\n(Hymenoptera) it is also the rule that the sexes are alike in colour,\r\nthough there are several cases among solitary bees where they differ;\r\nthe female being black, and the male brown in Anthophora retusa, while\r\nin Andraena fulva the female is more brightly coloured than the male. Of\r\nthe great order of beetles (Coleoptera) the same thing may be said.\r\nThough often so rich and varied in their colours the sexes are usually\r\nalike, and Mr. Darwin was only able to find about a dozen cases in which\r\nthere was any conspicuous difference between them.[119] They exhibit,\r\nhowever, numerous sexual characters, in the length of the antennae, and\r\nin horns, legs, or jaws remarkably enlarged or curiously modified in the\r\nmale sex.\r\n\r\nIt is in the family of dragonflies (order Neuroptera) that we first meet\r\nwith numerous cases of distinctive sexual coloration. In some of the\r\nAgrionidae the males have the bodies rich blue and the wings black,\r\nwhile the females have the bodies green and the wings transparent. In\r\nthe North American genus Hetaerina the males alone have a carmine spot\r\nat the base of each wing; but in some other genera the sexes hardly\r\ndiffer at all.\r\n\r\nThe great order of Lepidoptera, including the butterflies and moths,\r\naffords us the most numerous and striking examples of diversity of\r\nsexual colouring. Among the moths the difference is usually but slight,\r\nbeing manifested in a greater intensity of the colour of the smaller\r\nwinged male; but in a few cases there is a decided difference, as in the\r\nghost-moth (Hepialus humuli), in which the male is pure white, while the\r\nfemale is yellow with darker markings. This may be a recognition colour,\r\nenabling the female more readily to discover her mate; and this view\r\nreceives some support from the fact that in the Shetland Islands the\r\nmale is almost as yellow as the female, since it has been suggested that\r\nat midsummer, when this moth appears, there is in that high latitude\r\nsufficient twilight all night to render any special coloration\r\nunnecessary.[120]\r\n\r\nButterflies present us with a wonderful amount of sexual difference of\r\ncolour, in many cases so remarkable that the two sexes of the same\r\nspecies remained for many years under different names and were thought\r\nto be quite distinct species. We find, however, every gradation from\r\nperfect identity to complete diversity, and in some cases we are able to\r\nsee a reason for this difference. Beginning with the most extraordinary\r\ncases of diversity--as in Diadema misippus, where the male is black,\r\nornamented with a large white spot on each wing margined with rich\r\nchangeable blue, while the female is orange-brown with black spots and\r\nstripes--we find the explanation in the fact that the female mimics an\r\nuneatable Danais, and thus gains protection while laying its eggs on low\r\nplants in company with that insect. In the allied species, Diadema\r\nbolina, the females are also very different from the males, but are of\r\ndusky brown tints, evidently protective and very variable, some\r\nspecimens having a general resemblance to the uneatable Euplaeas; so\r\nthat we see here some of the earlier stages of both forms of protection.\r\nThe remarkable differences in some South American Pieridae are similarly\r\nexplained. The males of Pieris pyrrha, P. lorena, and several others,\r\nare white with a few black bands and marginal spots like so many of\r\ntheir allies, while the females are gaily coloured with yellow and\r\nbrown, and exactly resemble some species of the uneatable Heliconidae of\r\nthe same district. Similarly, in the Malay Archipelago, the female of\r\nDiadema anomala is glossy metallic blue, while the male is brown; the\r\nreason for this reversal of the usual rule being, that the female\r\nexactly mimics the brilliant colouring of the common and uneatable\r\nEuplaea midamus, and thus secures protection. In the fine Adolias\r\ndirtea, the male is black with a few specks of ochre-yellow and a broad\r\nmarginal band of rich metallic greenish-blue, while the female is\r\nbrownish-black entirely covered with rows of ochre-yellow spots. This\r\nlatter coloration does not appear to be protective when the insect is\r\nseen in the cabinet, but it really is so. I have observed the female of\r\nthis butterfly in Sumatra, where it settles on the ground in the forest,\r\nand its yellow spots so harmonise with the flickering gleams of sunlight\r\non the dead leaves that it can only be detected with the greatest\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nA hundred other cases might be quoted in which the female is either\r\nmore obscurely coloured than the male, or gains protection by imitating\r\nsome inedible species; and any one who has watched these female insects\r\nflying slowly along in search of the plants on which to deposit their\r\neggs, will understand how important it must be to them not to attract\r\nthe attention of insect-eating birds by too conspicuous colours. The\r\nnumber of birds which capture insects on the wing is much greater in\r\ntropical regions than in Europe; and this is perhaps the reason why many\r\nof our showy species are alike, or almost alike, in both sexes, while\r\nthey are protectively coloured on the under side which is exposed to\r\nview when they are at rest. Such are our peacock, tortoise-shell, and\r\nred admiral butterflies; while in the tropics we more commonly find that\r\nthe females are less conspicuous on the upper surface even when\r\nprotectively coloured beneath.\r\n\r\nWe may here remark, that the cases already quoted prove clearly that\r\neither male or female may be modified in colour apart from the opposite\r\nsex. In Pieris pyrrha and its allies the male retains the usual type of\r\ncoloration of the whole genus, while the female has acquired a distinct\r\nand peculiar style of colouring. In Adolias dirtea, on the other hand,\r\nthe female appears to retain something like the primitive colour and\r\nmarkings of the two sexes, modified perhaps for more perfect protection;\r\nwhile the male has acquired more and more intense and brilliant colours,\r\nonly showing his original markings by the few small yellow spots that\r\nremain near the base of the wings. In the more gaily coloured Pieridae,\r\nof which our orange-tip butterfly may be taken as a type, we see in the\r\nfemale the plain ancestral colours of the group, while the male has\r\nacquired the brilliant orange tip to its wings, probably as a\r\nrecognition mark.\r\n\r\nIn those species in which the under surface is protectively coloured, we\r\noften find the upper surface alike in both sexes, the tint of colour\r\nbeing usually more intense in the male. But in some cases this leads to\r\nthe female being more conspicuous, as in some of the Lycaenidae, where\r\nthe female is bright blue and the male of a blue so much deeper and\r\nsoberer in tint as to appear the less brilliantly coloured of the two.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Probable Causes of these Colours._\r\n\r\nIn the production of these varied results there have probably been\r\nseveral causes at work. There seems to be a constant tendency in the\r\nmale of most animals--but especially of birds and insects--to develop\r\nmore and more intensity of colour, often culminating in brilliant\r\nmetallic blues or greens or the most splendid iridescent hues; while, at\r\nthe same time, natural selection is constantly at work, preventing the\r\nfemale from acquiring these same tints, or modifying her colours in\r\nvarious directions to secure protection by assimilating her to her\r\nsurroundings, or by producing mimicry of some protected form. At the\r\nsame time, the need for recognition must be satisfied; and this seems to\r\nhave led to diversities of colour in allied species, sometimes the\r\nfemale, sometimes the male undergoing the greatest change according as\r\none or other could be modified with the greatest ease, and so as to\r\ninterfere least with the welfare of the race. Hence it is that sometimes\r\nthe males of allied species vary most, as in the different species of\r\nEpicalia; sometimes the females, as in the magnificent green species of\r\nOrnithoptera and the \"Aeneas\" group of Papilio.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the two principles--the need of protection and\r\nrecognition--in modifying the comparative coloration of the sexes among\r\nbutterflies, is beautifully illustrated in the case of the groups which\r\nare protected by their distastefulness, and whose females do not,\r\ntherefore, need the protection afforded by sober colours.\r\n\r\nIn the great families, Heliconidae and Acraeidae, we find that the two\r\nsexes are almost always alike; and, in the very few exceptions, that the\r\nfemale, though differently, is not less gaily or less conspicuously\r\ncoloured. In the Danaidae the same general rule prevails, but the cases\r\nin which the male exhibits greater intensity of colour than the female\r\nare perhaps more numerous than in the other two families. There is,\r\nhowever, a curious difference in this respect between the Oriental and\r\nthe American groups of distasteful Papilios with warning colours, both\r\nof which are the subjects of mimicry. In the Eastern groups--of which P.\r\nhector and P. coon may be taken as types--the two sexes are nearly\r\nalike, the male being sometimes more intensely coloured and with fewer\r\npale markings; but in the American groups--represented by P. aeneas, P.\r\nsesostris, and allies--there is a wonderful diversity, the males having\r\na rich green or bluish patch on the fore wings, while the females have a\r\nband or spots of pure white, not always corresponding in position to the\r\ngreen spot of the males. There are, however, transitional forms, by\r\nwhich a complete series can be traced, from close similarity to great\r\ndiversity of colouring between the sexes; and this may perhaps be only\r\nan extreme example of the intenser colour and more concentrated markings\r\nwhich are a very prevalent characteristic of male butterflies.\r\n\r\nThere are, in fact, many indications of a regular succession of tints in\r\nwhich colour development has occurred in the various groups of\r\nbutterflies, from an original grayish or brownish neutral tint. Thus in\r\nthe \"Aeneas\" group of Papilios we have the patch on the upper wings\r\nyellowish in P. triopas, olivaceous in P. bolivar, bronzy-gray with a\r\nwhite spot in P. erlaces, more greenish and buff in P. iphidamas,\r\ngradually changing to the fine blue of P. brissonius, and the\r\nmagnificent green of P. sesostris. In like manner, the intense crimson\r\nspots of the lower wings can be traced step by step from a yellow or\r\nbuff tint, which is one of the most widespread colours in the whole\r\norder. The greater purity and intensity of colour seem to be usually\r\nassociated with more pointed wings, indicating greater vigour and more\r\nrapid flight.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sexual Selection as a supposed Cause of Colour Development._\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin, as is well known, imputed most of the brilliant colours and\r\nvaried patterns of butterflies' wings to sexual selection--that is, to a\r\nconstant preference, by female butterflies, for the more brilliant\r\nmales; the colours thus produced being sometimes transmitted to the\r\nmales alone, sometimes to both sexes. This view has always seemed to me\r\nto be unsupported by evidence, while it is also quite inadequate to\r\naccount for the facts. The only direct evidence, as set forth with his\r\nusual fairness by Mr. Darwin himself, is opposed to his views. Several\r\nentomologists assured him that, in moths, the females evince not the\r\nleast choice of their partners; and Dr. Wallace of Colchester, who has\r\nlargely bred the fine Bombyx cynthia, confirmed this statement. Among\r\nbutterflies, several males often pursue one female, and Mr. Darwin says,\r\nthat, unless the female exerts a choice the pairing must be left to\r\nchance. But, surely, it may be the most vigorous or most persevering\r\nmale that is chosen, not necessarily one more brightly or differently\r\ncoloured, and this will be true \"natural selection.\" Butterflies have\r\nbeen noticed to prefer some coloured flowers to others; but that does\r\nnot prove, or even render probable, any preference for the colour\r\nitself, but only for flowers of certain colours, on account of the more\r\nagreeable or more abundant nectar obtained from them. Dr. Schulte called\r\nMr. Darwin's attention to the fact, that in the Diadema bolina the\r\nbrilliant blue colour surrounding the white spots is only visible when\r\nwe look towards the insect's head, and this is true of many of the\r\niridescent colours of butterflies, and probably depends upon the\r\ndirection of the striae on the scales. It is suggested, however, that\r\nthis display of colour will be seen by the female as the male is\r\napproaching her, and that it has been developed by sexual\r\nselection.[121] But in the majority of cases the males _follow_ the\r\nfemale, hovering over her in a position which would render it almost\r\nimpossible for her to see the particular colours or patterns on his\r\nupper surface; to do so the female should mount higher than the male,\r\nand fly towards him--being the seeker instead of the sought, and this is\r\nquite opposed to the actual facts. I cannot, therefore, think that this\r\nsuggestion adds anything whatever to the evidence for sexual selection\r\nof colour by female butterflies. This question will, however, be again\r\ntouched upon after we have considered the phenomena of sexual colour\r\namong the vertebrata.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sexual Coloration of Birds._\r\n\r\nThe general rule among vertebrates, as regards colour, is, for the two\r\nsexes to be alike. This prevails, with only a few exceptions, in fishes,\r\nreptiles, and mammalia; but in birds diversity of sexual colouring is\r\nexceedingly frequent, and is, not improbably, present in a greater or\r\nless degree in more than half of the known species. It is this class,\r\ntherefore, that will afford us the best materials for a discussion of\r\nthe problem, and that may perhaps lead us to a satisfactory explanation\r\nof the causes to which sexual colour is due.\r\n\r\nThe most fundamental characteristic of birds, from our present point of\r\nview, is a greater intensity of colour in the male. This is the case in\r\nhawks and falcons; in many thrushes, warblers, and finches; in pigeons,\r\npartridges, rails, plovers, and many others. When the plumage is highly\r\nprotective or of dull uniform tints, as in many of the thrushes and\r\nwarblers, the sexes are almost or quite identical in colour; but when\r\nany rich markings or bright tints are acquired, they are almost always\r\nwanting or much fainter in the female, as we see in the black-cap among\r\nwarblers, and the chaffinch among finches.\r\n\r\nIt is in tropical regions, where from a variety of causes colour has\r\nbeen, developed to its fullest extent, that we find the most remarkable\r\nexamples of sexual divergence of colour. The most gorgeously coloured\r\nbirds known are the birds of paradise, the chatterers, the tanagers, the\r\nhumming-birds, and the pheasant-tribe, including the peacocks. In all\r\nthese the females are much less brilliant, and, in the great majority of\r\ncases, exceptionally plain and dull coloured birds. Not only are the\r\nremarkable plumes, crests, and gorgets of the birds of paradise entirely\r\nwanting in the females, but these latter are usually without any bright\r\ncolour at all, and rank no higher than our thrushes in ornamental\r\nplumage. Of the humming-birds the same may be said, except that the\r\nfemales are often green, and sometimes slightly metallic, but from their\r\nsmall size and uniform tints are never conspicuous. The glorious blues\r\nand purples, the pure whites and intense crimsons of the male chatterers\r\nare represented in the females by olive-greens or dull browns, as are\r\nthe infinitely varied tints of the male tanagers. And in pheasants, the\r\nsplendour of plumage which characterises the males is entirely absent in\r\nthe females, which, though often ornamental, have always comparatively\r\nsober and protective tints. The same thing occurs with many other\r\ngroups. In the Eastern tropics are many brilliant birds belonging to the\r\nfamilies of the warblers, flycatchers, shrikes, etc., but the female is\r\nalways much less brilliant than the male and often quite dull coloured.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cause of Dull Colours of Female Birds._\r\n\r\nThe reason of this phenomenon is not difficult to find, if we consider\r\nthe essential conditions of a bird's existence, and the most important\r\nfunction it has to fulfil. In order that the species may be continued,\r\nyoung birds must be produced, and the female birds have to sit\r\nassiduously on their eggs. While doing this they are exposed to\r\nobservation and attack by the numerous devourers of eggs and birds, and\r\nit is of vital importance that they should be protectively coloured in\r\nall those parts of the body which are exposed during incubation. To\r\nsecure this end all the bright colours and showy ornaments which\r\ndecorate the male have not been acquired by the female, who often\r\nremains clothed in the sober hues which were probably once common to the\r\nwhole order to which she belongs. The different amounts of colour\r\nacquired by the females have no doubt depended on peculiarities of\r\nhabits and of environment, and on the powers of defence or of\r\nconcealment possessed by the species. Mr. Darwin has taught us that\r\nnatural selection cannot produce absolute, but only relative perfection;\r\nand as a protective colour is only one out of many means by which the\r\nfemale birds are able to provide for the safety of their young, those\r\nwhich are best endowed in other respects will have been allowed to\r\nacquire more colour than those with whom the struggle for existence is\r\nmore severe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relation of Sex Colour to Nesting Habits._\r\n\r\nThis principle is strikingly illustrated by the existence of\r\nconsiderable numbers of birds in which both sexes are similarly and\r\nbrilliantly coloured,--in some cases as brilliantly as the males of many\r\nof the groups above referred to. Such are the extensive families of the\r\nkingfishers, the woodpeckers, the toucans, the parrots, the turacos, the\r\nhangnests, the starlings, and many other smaller groups, all the species\r\nof which are conspicuously or brilliantly coloured, while in all of them\r\nthe females are either coloured exactly like the males, or, when\r\ndifferently coloured, are equally conspicuous. When searching for some\r\ncause for this singular apparent exception to the rule of female\r\nprotective colouring, I came upon a fact which beautifully explains it;\r\nfor in all these cases, without exception, the species either nests in\r\nholes in the ground or in trees, or builds a domed or covered nest, so\r\nas completely to conceal the sitting-bird. We have here a case exactly\r\nparallel to that of the butterflies protected by distastefulness, whose\r\nfemales are either exactly like the males, or, if different, are equally\r\nconspicuous. We can hardly believe that so exact a parallel should exist\r\nbetween such remote classes of animals, except under the influence of a\r\ngeneral law; and, in the need of protection by all defenceless animals,\r\nand especially by most female insects and birds, we have such a law,\r\nwhich has been proved to have influenced the colours of a considerable\r\nproportion of the animal kingdom.[122]\r\n\r\nThe general relation which exists between the mode of nesting and the\r\ncoloration of the sexes in those groups of birds which need protection\r\nfrom enemies, may be thus expressed: When both sexes are brilliant or\r\nconspicuous, the nest is such as to conceal the sitting-bird; but when\r\nthe male is brightly coloured and the female sits exposed on the nest,\r\nshe is always less brilliant and generally of quite sober and protective\r\nhues.\r\n\r\nIt must be understood that the mode of nesting has influenced the\r\ncolour, not that the colour has determined the mode of nesting; and\r\nthis, I believe, has been generally, though not perhaps universally, the\r\ncase. For we know that colour varies more rapidly, and can be more\r\neasily modified and fixed by selection, than any other character;\r\nwhereas habits, especially when connected with structure, and when they\r\npervade a whole group, are much more persistent and more difficult to\r\nchange, as shown by the habit of the dog turning round two or three\r\ntimes before lying down, believed to be that of the wild ancestral form\r\nwhich thus smoothed down the herbage so as to form a comfortable bed. We\r\nsee, too, that the general mode of nesting is characteristic of whole\r\nfamilies differing widely in size, form, and colours. Thus, all the\r\nkingfishers and their allies in every part of the world nest in holes,\r\nusually in banks, but sometimes in trees. The motmots and the puff-birds\r\n(Bucconidae) build in similar places; while the toucans, barbets,\r\ntrogons, woodpeckers, and parrots all make their nests in hollow trees.\r\nThis habit, pervading all the members of extensive families, must\r\ntherefore be extremely ancient, more especially as it evidently depends\r\nin some degree on the structure of the birds, the bills, and especially\r\nthe feet, of all these groups being unfitted for the construction of\r\nwoven arboreal nests.[123] But in all these families the colour varies\r\ngreatly from species to species, being constant only in the one\r\ncharacter of the similarity of the sexes, or, at all events, in their\r\nbeing equally conspicuous even though differently coloured.\r\n\r\nWhen I first put forward this view of the connection between the mode of\r\nnesting and the coloration of female birds, I expressed the law in\r\nsomewhat different terms, which gave rise to some misunderstanding, and\r\nled to numerous criticisms and objections. Several cases were brought\r\nforward in which the females were far less brilliant than the males,\r\nalthough the nest was covered. This is the case with the Maluridae, or\r\nsuperb warblers of Australia, in which the males are very brilliant\r\nduring the pairing season and the females quite plain, yet they build\r\ndomed nests. Here, there can be little doubt, the covered nest is a\r\nprotection from rain or from some special enemies to the eggs; while the\r\nbirds themselves are protectively coloured in both sexes, except for a\r\nshort time during the breeding season when the male acquires brilliant\r\ncolours; and this is probably connected with the fact of their\r\ninhabiting the open plains and thin scrub of Australia, where protective\r\ncolours are as generally advantageous as they are in our north-temperate\r\nzones.\r\n\r\nAs I have now stated the law, I do not think there are any exceptions to\r\nit, while there are an overwhelming number of cases which give it a\r\nstrong support. It has been objected that the domed nests of many birds\r\nare as conspicuous as the birds themselves would be, and would,\r\ntherefore, be of no use as a protection to the birds and young. But, as\r\na matter of fact, they do protect from attack, for hawks or crows do not\r\npluck such nests to pieces, as in doing so they would be exposed to the\r\nattack of the whole colony; whereas a hawk or falcon could carry off a\r\nsitting-bird or the young at a swoop, and entirely avoid attack.\r\nMoreover, each kind of covered nest is doubtless directed against the\r\nattacks of the most dangerous enemies of the species, the purse-like\r\nnests, often a yard long, suspended from the extremity of thin twigs,\r\nbeing useful against the attacks of snakes, which, if they attempted to\r\nenter them, would be easily made to lose their hold and fall to the\r\nground. Such birds as jays, crows, magpies, hawks, and other birds of\r\nprey, have also been urged as an exception; but these are all aggressive\r\nbirds, able to protect themselves, and thus do not need any special\r\nprotection for their females during nidification. Some birds which build\r\nin covered nests are comparatively dull coloured, like many of the\r\nweaver birds, but in others the colours are more showy, and in all the\r\nsexes are alike; so that none of these are in any way opposed to the\r\nrule. The golden orioles have, however, been adduced as a decided\r\nexception, since the females are showy and build in an open nest. But\r\neven here the females are less brilliant than the males, and are\r\nsometimes greenish or olivaceous on the upper surface; while they very\r\ncarefully conceal their nests among dense foliage, and the male is\r\nsufficiently watchful and pugnacious to drive off most intruders.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, how remarkable it is that the only small and brightly\r\ncoloured birds of our own country in which the male and female are\r\nalike--the tits and starlings--either build in holes or construct\r\ncovered nests; while the beautiful hangnests (Icteridae) of South\r\nAmerica, which always build covered or purse-shaped nests, are equally\r\nshowy in both sexes, in striking contrast with the chatterers and\r\ntanagers of the same country, whose females are invariably less\r\nconspicuous than the males. On a rough estimate, there are about 1200\r\nspecies of birds in the class of showy males and females, with concealed\r\nnidification; while there are probably, from an equally rough estimate,\r\nabout the same number in the contrasted class of showy males and dull\r\nfemales, with open nests. This will leave the great bulk of known birds\r\nin the classes of those which are more or less protectively coloured in\r\nboth sexes; or which, from their organisation and habits, do not\r\nrequire special protective coloration, such as many of the birds of\r\nprey, the larger waders, and the oceanic birds.\r\n\r\nThere are a few very curious cases in which the female bird is actually\r\nmore brilliant than the male, and which yet have open nests. Such are\r\nthe dotterel (Eudromias morinellus), several species of phalarope, an\r\nAustralian creeper (Climacteris erythropus), and a few others; but in\r\nevery one of these cases the relation of the sexes in regard to\r\nnidification is reversed, the male performing the duties of incubation,\r\nwhile the female is the stronger and more pugnacious. This curious case,\r\ntherefore, quite accords with the general law of coloration.[124]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sexual Colours of other Vertebrates._\r\n\r\nWe may consider a few of the cases of sexual colouring of other classes\r\nof vertebrates, as given by Mr. Darwin. In fishes, though the sexes are\r\nusually alike, there are several species in which the males are more\r\nbrightly coloured, and have more elongated fins, spines, or other\r\nappendages, and in some few cases the colours are decidedly different.\r\nThe males often fight together, and are altogether more vivacious and\r\nexcitable than the females during the breeding season; and with this we\r\nmay connect a greater intensity of coloration.\r\n\r\nIn frogs and toads the colours are usually alike, or a little more\r\nintense in the males, and the same may be said of most snakes. It is in\r\nlizards that we first meet with considerable sexual differences, many of\r\nthe species having gular pouches, frills, dorsal crests, or horns,\r\neither confined to the males, or more developed in them than in the\r\nfemales, and these ornaments are often brightly coloured. In most cases,\r\nhowever, the tints of lizards are protective, the male being usually a\r\nlittle more intense in coloration; and the difference in extreme cases\r\nmay be partly due to the need of protection for the female, which, when\r\nladen with eggs, must be less active and less able to escape from\r\nenemies than the male, and may, therefore, have retained more protective\r\ncolours, as so many insects and birds have certainly done.[125]\r\n\r\nIn mammalia there is often a somewhat greater intensity of colour in\r\nthe male, but rarely a decided difference. The female of the great red\r\nkangaroo, however, is a delicate gray; while in the Lemur macaco of\r\nMadagascar the male is jet-black and the female brown. In many monkeys\r\nalso there are some differences of colour, especially on the face. The\r\nsexual weapons and ornaments of male mammalia, as horns, crests, manes,\r\nand dewlaps, are well known, and are very numerous and remarkable.\r\nHaving thus briefly reviewed the facts, we will now consider the\r\ntheories to which they have given rise.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sexual Selection by the Struggles of Males._\r\n\r\nAmong the higher animals it is a very general fact that the males fight\r\ntogether for the possession of the females. This leads, in polygamous\r\nanimals especially, to the stronger or better armed males becoming the\r\nparents of the next generation, which inherits the peculiarities of the\r\nparents; and thus vigour and offensive weapons are continually increased\r\nin the males, resulting in the strength and horns of the bull, the tusks\r\nof the boar, the antlers of the stag, and the spurs and fighting\r\ninstinct of the gamecock. But almost all male animals fight together,\r\nthough not specially armed; even hares, moles, squirrels, and beavers\r\nfight to the death, and are often found to be scarred and wounded. The\r\nsame rule applies to almost all male birds; and these battles have been\r\nobserved in such different groups as humming-birds, finches,\r\ngoatsuckers, woodpeckers, ducks, and waders. Among reptiles, battles of\r\nthe males are known to occur in the cases of crocodiles, lizards, and\r\ntortoises; among fishes, in those of salmon and sticklebats. Even among\r\ninsects the same law prevails; and male spiders, beetles of many groups,\r\ncrickets, and butterflies often fight together.\r\n\r\nFrom this very general phenomenon there necessarily results a form of\r\nnatural selection which increases the vigour and fighting power of the\r\nmale animal, since, in every case, the weaker are either killed,\r\nwounded, or driven away. This selection would be more powerful if males\r\nwere always in excess of females, but after much research Mr. Darwin\r\ncould not obtain any satisfactory evidence that this was the case. The\r\nsame effect, however, is produced in some cases by constitution or\r\nhabits; thus male insects usually emerge first from the pupa, and among\r\nmigrating birds the males arrive first both in this country and in North\r\nAmerica. The struggle is thus intensified, and the most vigorous males\r\nare the first to have offspring. This in all probability is a great\r\nadvantage, as the early breeders have the start in securing food, and\r\nthe young are strong enough to protect themselves while the later broods\r\nare being produced.\r\n\r\nIt is to this form of male rivalry that Mr. Darwin first applied the\r\nterm \"sexual selection.\" It is evidently a real power in nature; and to\r\nit we must impute the development of the exceptional strength, size, and\r\nactivity of the male, together with the possession of special offensive\r\nand defensive weapons, and of all other characters which arise from the\r\ndevelopment of these or are correlated with them. But he has extended\r\nthe principle into a totally different field of action, which has none\r\nof that character of constancy and of inevitable result that attaches to\r\nnatural selection, including male rivalry; for by far the larger portion\r\nof the phenomena, which he endeavours to explain by the direct action of\r\nsexual selection, can only be so explained on the hypothesis that the\r\nimmediate agency is female choice or preference. It is to this that he\r\nimputes the origin of all secondary sexual characters other than weapons\r\nof offence and defence, of all the ornamental crests and accessory\r\nplumes of birds, the stridulating sounds of insects, the crests and\r\nbeards of monkeys and other mammals, and the brilliant colours and\r\npatterns of male birds and butterflies. He even goes further, and\r\nimputes to it a large portion of the brilliant colour that occurs in\r\nboth sexes, on the principle that variations occurring in one sex are\r\nsometimes transmitted to the same sex only, sometimes to both, owing to\r\npeculiarities in the laws of inheritance. In this extension of sexual\r\nselection to include the action of female choice or preference, and in\r\nthe attempt to give to that choice such wide-reaching effects, I am\r\nunable to follow him more than a very little way; and I will now state\r\nsome of the reasons why I think his views are unsound.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sexual Characters due to Natural Selection._\r\n\r\nBesides the acquisition of weapons by the male for the purpose of\r\nfighting with other males, there are some other sexual characters which\r\nmay have been produced by natural selection. Such are the various sounds\r\nand odours which are peculiar to the male, and which serve as a call to\r\nthe female or as an indication of his presence. These are evidently a\r\nvaluable addition to the means of recognition of the two sexes, and are\r\na further indication that the pairing season has arrived; and the\r\nproduction, intensification, and differentiation of these sounds and\r\nodours are clearly within the power of natural selection. The same\r\nremark will apply to the peculiar calls of birds, and even to the\r\nsinging of the males. These may well have originated merely as a means\r\nof recognition between the two sexes of a species, and as an invitation\r\nfrom the male to the female bird. When the individuals of a species are\r\nwidely scattered, such a call must be of great importance in enabling\r\npairing to take place as early as possible, and thus the clearness,\r\nloudness, and individuality of the song becomes a useful character, and\r\ntherefore the subject of natural selection. Such is especially the case\r\nwith the cuckoo, and with all solitary birds, and it may have been\r\nequally important at some period of the development of all birds. The\r\nact of singing is evidently a pleasurable one; and it probably serves as\r\nan outlet for superabundant nervous energy and excitement, just as\r\ndancing, singing, and field sports do with us. It is suggestive of this\r\nview that the exercise of the vocal power seems to be complementary to\r\nthe development of accessory plumes and ornaments, all our finest\r\nsinging birds being plainly coloured, and with no crests, neck or tail\r\nplumes to display; while the gorgeously ornamented birds of the tropics\r\nhave no song, and those which expend much energy in display of plumage,\r\nas the turkey, peacocks, birds of paradise, and humming-birds, have\r\ncomparatively an insignificant development of voice. Some birds have, in\r\nthe wings or tail, peculiarly developed feathers which produce special\r\nsounds. In some of the little manakins of Brazil, two or three of the\r\nwing-feathers are curiously shaped and stiffened in the male, so that\r\nthe bird is able to produce with them a peculiar snapping or cracking\r\nsound; and the tail-feathers of several species of snipe are so narrowed\r\nas to produce distinct drumming, whistling, or switching sounds when the\r\nbirds descend rapidly from a great height. All these are probably\r\nrecognition and call notes, useful to each species in relation to the\r\nmost important function of their lives, and thus capable of being\r\ndeveloped by the agency of natural selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Decorative Plumage of Birds and its Display._\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin has devoted four chapters of his _Descent of Man_ to the\r\ncolours of birds, their decorative plumage, and its display at the\r\npairing season; and it is on this latter circumstance that he founds his\r\ntheory, that both the plumage and the colours have been developed by the\r\npreference of the females, the more ornamented males becoming the\r\nparents of each successive generation. Any one who reads these most\r\ninteresting chapters will admit, that the fact of the display is\r\ndemonstrated; and it may also be admitted, as highly probable, that the\r\nfemale is pleased or excited by the display. But it by no means follows\r\nthat slight differences in the shape, pattern, or colours of the\r\nornamental plumes are what lead a female to give the preference to one\r\nmale over another; still less that all the females of a species, or the\r\ngreat majority of them, over a wide area of country, and for many\r\nsuccessive generations, prefer exactly the same modification of the\r\ncolour or ornament.\r\n\r\nThe evidence on this matter is very scanty, and in most cases not at all\r\nto the point. Some peahens preferred an old pied peacock; albino birds\r\nin a state of nature have never been seen paired with other birds; a\r\nCanada goose paired with a Bernicle gander; a male widgeon preferred a\r\npintail duck to its own species; a hen canary preferred a male\r\ngreenfinch to either linnet, goldfinch, siskin, or chaffinch. These\r\ncases are evidently exceptional, and are not such as generally occur in\r\nnature; and they only prove that the female does exert some choice\r\nbetween very different males, and some observations on birds in a state\r\nof nature prove the same thing; but there is no evidence that slight\r\nvariations in the colour or plumes, in the way of increased intensity or\r\ncomplexity, are what determines the choice. On the other hand, Mr.\r\nDarwin gives much evidence that it is _not_ so determined. He tells us\r\nthat Messrs. Hewitt, Tegetmeier, and Brent, three of the highest\r\nauthorities and best observers, \"do not believe that the females prefer\r\ncertain males on account of the beauty of their plumage.\" Mr. Hewitt was\r\nconvinced \"that the female almost invariably prefers the most vigorous,\r\ndefiant, and mettlesome male;\" and Mr. Tegetmeier, \"that a gamecock,\r\nthough disfigured by being dubbed, and with his hackles trimmed, would\r\nbe accepted as readily as a male retaining all his natural\r\nornaments.\"[126] Evidence is adduced that a female pigeon will sometimes\r\nturn antipathy to a particular male without any assignable cause; or, in\r\nother cases, will take a strong fancy to some one bird, and will desert\r\nher own mate for him; but it is not stated that superiority or\r\ninferiority of plumage has anything to do with these fancies. Two\r\ninstances are indeed given, of male birds being rejected, which had lost\r\ntheir ornamental plumage; but in both cases (a widow-finch and a silver\r\npheasant) the long tail-plumes are the indication of sexual maturity.\r\nSuch cases do not support the idea that males with the tail-feathers a\r\ntrifle longer, or the colours a trifle brighter, are generally\r\npreferred, and that those which are only a little inferior are as\r\ngenerally rejected,--and this is what is absolutely needed to establish\r\nthe theory of the development of these plumes by means of the choice of\r\nthe female.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, that female birds have unaccountable likes and dislikes\r\nin the matter of their partners, just as we have ourselves, and this may\r\nafford us an illustration. A young man, when courting, brushes or curls\r\nhis hair, and has his moustache, beard, or whiskers in perfect order,\r\nand no doubt his sweetheart admires them; but this does not prove that\r\nshe marries him on account of these ornaments, still less that hair,\r\nbeard, whiskers, and moustache were developed by the continued\r\npreferences of the female sex. So, a girl likes to see her lover well\r\nand fashionably dressed, and he always dresses as well as he can when he\r\nvisits her; but we cannot conclude from this that the whole series of\r\nmale costumes, from the brilliantly coloured, puffed, and slashed\r\ndoublet and hose of the Elizabethan period, through the gorgeous coats,\r\nlong waistcoats, and pigtails of the early Georgian era, down to the\r\nfunereal dress-suit of the present day, are the direct result of female\r\npreference. In like manner, female birds may be charmed or excited by\r\nthe fine display of plumage by the males; but there is no proof whatever\r\nthat slight differences in that display have any effect in determining\r\ntheir choice of a partner.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Display of Decorative Plumage._\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary manner in which most birds display their plumage at\r\nthe time of courtship, apparently with the full knowledge that it is\r\nbeautiful, constitutes one of Mr. Darwin's strongest arguments. It is,\r\nno doubt, a very curious and interesting phenomenon, and indicates a\r\nconnection between the exertion of particular muscles and the\r\ndevelopment of colour and ornament; but, for the reasons just given, it\r\ndoes not prove that the ornament has been developed by female choice.\r\nDuring excitement, and when the organism develops superabundant energy,\r\nmany animals find it pleasurable to exercise their various muscles,\r\noften in fantastic ways, as seen in the gambols of kittens, lambs, and\r\nother young animals. But at the time of pairing, male birds are in a\r\nstate of the most perfect development, and possess an enormous store of\r\nvitality; and under the excitement of the sexual passion they perform\r\nstrange antics or rapid flights, as much probably from an internal\r\nimpulse to motion and exertion as with any desire to please their mates.\r\nSuch are the rapid descent of the snipe, the soaring and singing of the\r\nlark, and the dances of the cock-of-the-rock and of many other birds.\r\n\r\nIt is very suggestive that similar strange movements are performed by\r\nmany birds which have no ornamental plumage to display. Goatsuckers,\r\ngeese, carrion vultures, and many other birds of plain plumage have been\r\nobserved to dance, spread their wings or tails, and perform strange\r\nlove-antics. The courtship of the great albatross, a most unwieldy and\r\ndull coloured bird, has been thus described by Professor Moseley: \"The\r\nmale, standing by the female on the nest, raises his wings, spreads his\r\ntail and elevates it, throws up his head with the bill in the air, or\r\nstretches it straight out, or forwards, as far as he can, and then\r\nutters a curious cry.\"[127] Mr. Jenner Weir informs me that \"the male\r\nblackbird is full of action, spreads out his glossy wing and tail, turns\r\nhis rich golden beak towards the female, and chuckles with delight,\"\r\nwhile he has never seen the more plain coloured thrush demonstrative to\r\nthe female. The linnet distends his rosy breast, and slightly expands\r\nhis brown wings and tail; while the various gay coloured Australian\r\nfinches adopt such attitudes and postures as, in every case, to show off\r\ntheir variously coloured plumage to the best advantage.[128]\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Theory of Animal Coloration._\r\n\r\nHaving rejected Mr. Darwin's theory of female choice as incompetent to\r\naccount for the brilliant colours and markings of the higher animals,\r\nthe preponderance of these colours and markings in the male sex, and\r\ntheir display during periods of activity or excitement, I may be asked\r\nwhat explanation I have to offer as a preferable substitute. In my\r\n_Tropical Nature_ I have already indicated such a theory, which I will\r\nnow briefly explain, supporting it by some additional facts and\r\narguments, which appear to me to have great weight, and for which I am\r\nmainly indebted to a most interesting and suggestive posthumous work by\r\nMr. Alfred Tylor.[129]\r\n\r\nThe fundamental or ground colours of animals ar has been shown in\r\npreceding chapters, very largely protective, and it is not improbable\r\nthat the primitive colours of all animals were so. During the long\r\ncourse of animal development other modes of protection than concealment\r\nby harmony of colour arose, and thenceforth the normal development of\r\ncolour due to the complex chemical and structural changes ever going on\r\nin the organism, had full play; and the colours thus produced were again\r\nand again modified by natural selection for purposes of warning,\r\nrecognition, mimicry, or special protection, as has been already fully\r\nexplained in the preceding chapters.\r\n\r\nMr. Taylor has, however, called attention to an important principle\r\nwhich underlies the various patterns or ornamental markings of\r\nanimals--namely, that diversified coloration follows the chief lines of\r\nstructure, and changes at points, such as the joints, where function\r\nchanges. He says, \"If we take highly decorated species--that is, animals\r\nmarked by alternate dark or light bands or spots, such as the zebra,\r\nsome deer, or the carnivora, we find, first, that the region of the\r\nspinal column is marked by a dark stripe; secondly, that the regions of\r\nthe appendages, or limbs, are differently marked; thirdly, that the\r\nflanks are striped or spotted, along or between the regions of the lines\r\nof the ribs; fourthly, that the shoulder and hip regions are marked by\r\ncurved lines; fifthly, that the pattern changes, and the direction of\r\nthe lines, or spots, at the head, neck, and every joint of the limbs;\r\nand lastly, that the tips of the ears, nose, tail, and feet, and the eye\r\nare emphasised in colour. In spotted animals the greatest length of the\r\nspot is generally in the direction of the largest development of the\r\nskeleton.\"\r\n\r\nThis structural decoration is well seen in many insects. In\r\ncaterpillars, similar spots and markings are repeated in each segment,\r\nexcept where modified for some form of protection. In butterflies, the\r\nspots and bands usually have reference to the form of the wing and the\r\narrangement of the nervures; and there is much evidence to show that the\r\nprimitive markings are always spots in the cells, or between the\r\nnervures, or at the junctions of nervures, the extension and coalescence\r\nof these spots forming borders, bands, or blotches, which have become\r\nmodified in infinitely varied ways for protection, warning, or\r\nrecognition. Even in birds, the distribution of colours and markings\r\nfollows generally the same law. The crown of the head, the throat, the\r\near-coverts, and the eyes have usually distinct tints in all highly\r\ncoloured birds; the region of the furcula has often a distinct patch of\r\ncolour, as have the pectoral muscles, the uropygium or root of the tail,\r\nand the under tail-coverts.[130]\r\n\r\nMr. Tylor was of opinion the primitive form of ornamentation consisted\r\nof spots, the confluence of these in certain directions forming lines or\r\nbands; and, these again, sometimes coalescing into blotches, or into\r\nmore or less uniform tints covering a large portion of the surface of\r\nthe body. The young lion and tiger are both spotted; and in the Java hog\r\n(Sus vittatus) very young animals are banded, but have spots over the\r\nshoulders and thighs. These spots run into stripes as the animal grows\r\nolder; then the stripes expand, and at last, meeting together, the adult\r\nanimal becomes of a uniform dark brown colour. So many of the species of\r\ndeer are spotted when young, that Darwin concludes the ancestral form,\r\nfrom which all deer are derived, must have been spotted. Pigs and tapirs\r\nare banded or spotted when young; an imported young specimen of Tapirus\r\nBairdi was covered with white spots in longitudinal rows, here and there\r\nforming short stripes.[131] Even the horse, which Darwin supposes to be\r\ndescended from a striped animal, is often spotted, as in dappled horses;\r\nand great numbers show a tendency to spottiness, especially on the\r\nhaunches.\r\n\r\nOcelli may also be developed from spots, or from bars, as pointed out by\r\nMr. Darwin. Spots are an ordinary form of marking in disease, and these\r\nspots sometimes run together, forming blotches. There is evidence that\r\ncolour markings are in some way dependent on nerve distribution. In the\r\ndisease known as frontal herpes, an eruption occurs which corresponds\r\nexactly to the distribution of the ophthalmic division of the fifth\r\ncranial nerve, mapping out all its little branches even to the one which\r\ngoes to the tip of the nose. In a Hindoo suffering from herpes the\r\npigment was destroyed in the arm along the course of the ulnar nerve,\r\nwith its branches along both sides of one finger and the half of\r\nanother. In the leg the sciatic and scaphenous nerves were partly mapped\r\nout, giving to the patient the appearance of an anatomical diagram.[132]\r\n\r\nThese facts are very interesting, because they help to explain the\r\ngeneral dependence of marking on structure which has been already\r\npointed out. For, as the nerves everywhere follow the muscles, and these\r\nare attached to the various bones, we see how it happens, that the\r\ntracts in which distinct developments of colour appear, should so often\r\nbe marked out by the chief divisions of the bony structure in\r\nvertebrates, and by the segments in the annulosa. There is, however,\r\nanother correspondence of even greater interest and importance.\r\nBrilliant colours usually appear just in proportion to the development\r\nof tegumentary appendages. Among birds the most brilliant colours are\r\npossessed by those which have developed frills, crests, and elongated\r\ntails like the humming-birds; immense tail-coverts like the peacock;\r\nenormously expanded wing-feathers, as in the argus-pheasant; or\r\nmagnificent plumes from the region of the coracoids in many of the birds\r\nof paradise. It is to be noted, also, that all these accessory plumes\r\nspring from parts of the body which, in other species, are distinguished\r\nby patches of colour; so that we may probably impute the development of\r\ncolour and of accessory plumage to the same fundamental cause.\r\n\r\nAmong insects, the most brilliant and varied coloration occurs in the\r\nbutterflies and moths, groups in which the wing-membranes have received\r\ntheir greatest expansion, and whose specialisation has been carried\r\nfurthest in the marvellous scaly covering which is the seat of the\r\ncolour. It is suggestive, that the only other group in which functional\r\nwings are much coloured is that of the dragonflies, where the membrane\r\nis exceedingly expanded. In like manner, the colours of beetles, though\r\ngreatly inferior to those of the lepidoptera, occur in a group in which\r\nthe anterior pair of wings has been thickened and modified in order to\r\nprotect the vital parts, and in which these wing-covers (elytra), in the\r\ncourse of development in the different groups, must have undergone great\r\nchanges, and have been the seat of very active growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Origin of Accessory Plumes._\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin supposes, that these have in almost every case been developed\r\nby the preference of female birds for such males as possessed them in a\r\nhigher degree than others; but this theory does not account for the fact\r\nthat these plumes usually appear in a few definite parts of the body. We\r\nrequire some cause to initiate the development in one part rather than\r\nin another. Now, the view that colour has arisen over surfaces where\r\nmuscular and nervous development is considerable, and the fact that it\r\nappears especially upon the accessory or highly developed plumes, leads\r\nus to inquire whether the same cause has not primarily determined the\r\ndevelopment of these plumes. The immense tuft of golden plumage in the\r\nbest known birds of paradise (Paradisea apoda and P. minor) springs\r\nfrom a very small area on the side of the breast. Mr. Frank E. Beddard,\r\nwho has kindly examined a specimen for me, says that \"this area lies\r\nupon the pectoral muscles, and near to the point where the fibres of the\r\nmuscle converge towards their attachment to the humerus. The plumes\r\narise, therefore, close to the most powerful muscle of the body, and\r\nnear to where the activities of that muscle would be at a maximum.\r\nFurthermore, the area of attachment of the plumes is just above the\r\npoint where the arteries and nerves for the supply of the pectoral\r\nmuscles, and neighbouring regions, leave the interior of the body. The\r\narea of attachment of the plume is, also, as you say in your letter,\r\njust above the junction of the coracoid and sternum.\" Ornamental plumes\r\nof considerable size rise from the same part in many other species of\r\nparadise birds, sometimes extending laterally in front, so as to form\r\nbreast shields. They also occur in many humming-birds, and in some\r\nsun-birds and honey-suckers; and in all these cases there is a wonderful\r\namount of activity and rapid movement, indicating a surplus of vitality,\r\nwhich is able to manifest itself in the development of these accessory\r\nplumes.[133]\r\n\r\nIn a quite distinct set of birds, the gallinaceae, we find the\r\nornamental plumage usually arising from very different parts, in the\r\nform of elongated tail-feathers or tail-coverts, and of ruffs or hackles\r\nfrom the neck. Here the wings are comparatively little used, the most\r\nconstant activities depending on the legs, since the gallinaceae are\r\npre-eminently walking, running, and scratching birds. Now the\r\nmagnificent train of the peacock--the grandest development of accessory\r\nplumes in this order--springs from an oval or circular area, about three\r\ninches in diameter, just above the base of the tail, and, therefore,\r\nsituated over the lower part of the spinal column near the insertion of\r\nthe powerful muscles which move the hind limbs and elevate the tail. The\r\nvery frequent presence of neck-ruffs or breast-shields in the males of\r\nbirds with accessory plumes may be partly due to selection, because they\r\nmust serve as a protection in their mutual combats, just as does the\r\nlion's or the horse's mane. The enormously lengthened plumes of the bird\r\nof paradise and of the peacock can, however, have no such use, but must\r\nbe rather injurious than beneficial in the bird's ordinary life. The\r\nfact that they have been developed to so great an extent in a few\r\nspecies is an indication of such perfect adaptation to the conditions of\r\nexistence, such complete success in the battle for life, that there is,\r\nin the adult male at all events, a surplus of strength, vitality, and\r\ngrowth-power which is able to expend itself in this way without injury.\r\nThat such is the case is shown by the great abundance of most of the\r\nspecies which possess these wonderful superfluities of plumage. Birds of\r\nparadise are among the commonest birds in New Guinea, and their loud\r\nvoices can be often heard when the birds themselves are invisible in the\r\ndepths of the forest; while Indian sportsmen have described the peafowl\r\nas being so abundant, that from twelve to fifteen hundred have been seen\r\nwithin an hour at one spot; and they range over the whole country from\r\nthe Himalayas to Ceylon. Why, in allied species, the development of\r\naccessory plumes has taken different forms, we are unable to say, except\r\nthat it may be due to that individual variability which has served as\r\nthe starting-point for so much of what seems to us strange in form, or\r\nfantastic in colour, both in the animal and vegetable world.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Development of Accessory Plumes and their Display._\r\n\r\nIf we have found a _vera causa_ for the origin of ornamental appendages\r\nof birds and other animals in a surplus of vital energy, leading to\r\nabnormal growths in those parts of the integument where muscular and\r\nnervous action are greatest, the continuous development of these\r\nappendages will result from the ordinary action of natural selection in\r\npreserving the most healthy and vigorous individuals, and the still\r\nfurther selective agency of sexual struggle in giving to the very\r\nstrongest and most energetic the parentage of the next generation. And,\r\nas all the evidence goes to show that, so far as female birds exercise\r\nany choice, it is of \"the most vigorous, defiant, and mettlesome male,\"\r\nthis form of sexual selection will act in the same direction, and help\r\nto carry on the process of plume development to its culmination. That\r\nculmination will be reached when the excessive length or abundance of\r\nthe plumes begins to be injurious to the bearer of them; and it may be\r\nthis check to the further lengthening of the peacock's train that has\r\nled to the broadening of the feathers at the ends, and the consequent\r\nproduction of the magnificent eye-spots which now form its crowning\r\nornament.\r\n\r\nThe display of these plumes will result from the same causes which led\r\nto their production. Just in proportion as the feathers themselves\r\nincreased in length and abundance, the skin-muscles which serve to\r\nelevate them would increase also; and the nervous development as well as\r\nthe supply of blood to these parts being at a maximum, the erection of\r\nthe plumes would become a habit at all periods of nervous or sexual\r\nexcitement. The display of the plumes, like the existence of the plumes\r\nthemselves, would be the chief external indication of the maturity and\r\nvigour of the male, and would, therefore, be necessarily attractive to\r\nthe female. We have, thus, no reason for imputing to her any of those\r\naesthetic emotions which are excited in us, by the beauty of form,\r\ncolour, and pattern of these plumes; or the still more improbable\r\naesthetic tastes, which would cause her to choose her mate on account of\r\nminute differences in their forms, colours, or patterns.\r\n\r\nAs co-operating causes in the production of accessory ornamental plumes,\r\nI have elsewhere suggested[134] that crests and other erectile feathers\r\nmay have been useful in making the bird more formidable in appearance,\r\nand thus serving to frighten away enemies; while long tail or wing\r\nfeathers might serve to distract the aim of a bird of prey. But though\r\nthis might be of some use in the earlier stages of their development, it\r\nis probably of little importance compared with the vigour and pugnacity\r\nof which the plumes are the indication, and which enable most of their\r\npossessors to defend themselves against the enemies which are dangerous\r\nto weaker and more timid birds. Even the tiny humming-birds are said to\r\nattack birds of prey that approach too near to their nests.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Effect of Female Preference will be Neutralised by Natural\r\nSelection._\r\n\r\nThe various facts and arguments now briefly set forth, afford an\r\nexplanation of the phenomena of male ornament, as being due to the\r\ngeneral laws of growth and development, and make it unnecessary to call\r\nto our aid so hypothetical a cause as the cumulative action of female\r\npreference. There remains, however, a general argument, arising from the\r\naction of natural selection itself, which renders it almost\r\ninconceivable that female preference could have been effective in the\r\nway suggested; while the same argument strongly supports the view here\r\nset forth. Natural selection, as we have seen in our earlier chapters,\r\nacts perpetually and on an enormous scale in weeding out the \"unfit\" at\r\nevery stage of existence, and preserving only those which are in all\r\nrespects the very best. Each year, only a small percentage of young\r\nbirds survive to take the place of the old birds which die; and the\r\nsurvivors will be those which are best able to maintain existence from\r\nthe egg onwards, an important factor being that their parents should be\r\nwell able to feed and protect them, while they themselves must in turn\r\nbe equally able to feed and protect their own offspring. Now this\r\nextremely rigid action of natural selection must render any attempt to\r\nselect mere ornament utterly nugatory, unless the most ornamented always\r\ncoincide with \"the fittest\" in every other respect; while, if they do so\r\ncoincide, then any selection of ornament is altogether superfluous. If\r\nthe most brightly coloured and fullest plumaged males are _not_ the most\r\nhealthy and vigorous, have _not_ the best instincts for the proper\r\nconstruction and concealment of the nest, and for the care and\r\nprotection of the young, they are certainly not the fittest, and will\r\nnot survive, or be the parents of survivors. If, on the other hand,\r\nthere _is_ generally this correlation--if, as has been here argued,\r\nornament is the natural product and direct outcome of superabundant\r\nhealth and vigour, then no other mode of selection is needed to account\r\nfor the presence of such ornament. The action of natural selection does\r\nnot indeed disprove the existence of female selection of ornament as\r\nornament, but it renders it entirely ineffective; and as the direct\r\nevidence for any such female selection is almost _nil_, while the\r\nobjections to it are certainly weighty, there can be no longer any\r\nreason for upholding a theory which was provisionally useful in calling\r\nattention to a most curious and suggestive body of facts, but which is\r\nnow no longer tenable. The term \"sexual selection\" must, therefore, be\r\nrestricted to the direct results of male struggle and combat. This is\r\nreally a form of natural selection, and is a matter of direct\r\nobservation; while its results are as clearly deducible as those of any\r\nof the other modes in which selection acts. And if this restriction of\r\nthe term is needful in the case of the higher animals it is much more so\r\nwith the lower. In butterflies the weeding out by natural selection\r\ntakes place to an enormous extent in the egg, larva, and pupa states;\r\nand perhaps not more than one in a hundred of the eggs laid produces a\r\nperfect insect which lives to breed. Here, then, the impotence of female\r\nselection, if it exist, must be complete; for, unless the most\r\nbrilliantly coloured males are those which produce the best protected\r\neggs, larvae, and pupae, and unless the particular eggs, larvae, and\r\npupae, which are able to survive, are those which produce the most\r\nbrilliantly coloured butterflies, any choice the female might make must\r\nbe completely swamped. If, on the other hand, there _is_ this\r\ncorrelation between colour development and perfect adaptation to\r\nconditions in all stages, then this development will necessarily proceed\r\nby the agency of natural selection and the general laws which determine\r\nthe production of colour and of ornamental appendages.[135]\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Laws of Animal Coloration._\r\n\r\nThe condensed account which has now been given of the phenomena of\r\ncolour in the animal world will sufficiently show the wonderful\r\ncomplexity and extreme interest of the subject; while it affords an\r\nadmirable illustration of the importance of the great principle of\r\nutility, and of the effect of the theories of natural selection and\r\ndevelopment in giving a new interest to the most familiar facts of\r\nnature. Much yet remains to be done, both in the observation of new\r\nfacts as to the relations between the colours of animals and their\r\nhabits or economy, and, more especially, in the elucidation of the laws\r\nof growth which determine changes of colour in the various groups; but\r\nso much is already known that we are able, with some confidence, to\r\nformulate the general principles which have brought about all the beauty\r\nand variety of colour which everywhere delight us in our contemplation\r\nof animated nature. A brief statement of these principles will fitly\r\nconclude our exposition of the subject.\r\n\r\n1. Colour may be looked upon as a necessary result of the highly complex\r\nchemical constitution of animal tissues and fluids. The blood, the bile,\r\nthe bones, the fat, and other tissues have characteristic, and often\r\nbrilliant colours, which we cannot suppose to have been determined for\r\nany special purpose, as colours, since they are usually concealed. The\r\nexternal organs, with their various appendages and integuments, would,\r\nby the same general laws, naturally give rise to a greater variety of\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\n2. We find it to be the fact that colour increases in variety and\r\nintensity as external structures and dermal appendages become more\r\ndifferentiated and developed. It is on scales, hair, and especially on\r\nthe more highly specialised feathers, that colour is most varied and\r\nbeautiful; while among insects colour is most fully developed in those\r\nwhose wing membranes are most expanded, and, as in the lepidoptera, are\r\nclothed with highly specialised scales. Here, too, we find an additional\r\nmode of colour production in transparent lamellae or in fine surface\r\nstriae which, by the laws of interference, produce the wonderful\r\nmetallic hues of so many birds and insects.\r\n\r\n3. There are indications of a progressive change of colour, perhaps in\r\nsome definite order, accompanying the development of tissues or\r\nappendages. Thus spots spread and fuse into bands, and when a lateral or\r\ncentrifugal expansion has occurred--as in the termination of the\r\npeacocks' train feathers, the outer web of the secondary quills of the\r\nArgus pheasant, or the broad and rounded wings of many butterflies--into\r\nvariously shaded or coloured ocelli. The fact that we find gradations of\r\ncolour in many of the more extensive groups, from comparatively dull or\r\nsimple to brilliant and varied hues, is an indication of some such law\r\nof development, due probably to progressive local segregation in the\r\ntissues of identical chemical or organic molecules, and dependent on\r\nlaws of growth yet to be investigated.\r\n\r\n4. The colours thus produced, and subject to much individual variation,\r\nhave been modified in innumerable ways for the benefit of each species.\r\nThe most general modification has been in such directions as to favour\r\nconcealment when at rest in the usual surroundings of the species,\r\nsometimes carried on by successive steps till it has resulted in the\r\nmost minute imitation of some inanimate object or exact mimicry of some\r\nother animal. In other cases bright colours or striking contrasts have\r\nbeen preserved, to serve as a warning of inedibility or of dangerous\r\npowers of attack. Most frequent of all has been the specialisation of\r\neach distinct form by some tint or marking for purposes of easy\r\nrecognition, especially in the case of gregarious animals whose safety\r\nlargely depends upon association and mutual defence.\r\n\r\n5. As a general rule the colours of the two sexes are alike; but in the\r\nhigher animals there appears a tendency to deeper or more intense\r\ncolouring in the male, due probably to his greater vigour and\r\nexcitability. In many groups in which this superabundant vitality is at\r\na maximum, the development of dermal appendages and brilliant colours\r\nhas gone on increasing till it has resulted in a great diversity between\r\nthe sexes; and in most of these cases there is evidence to show that\r\nnatural selection has caused the female to retain the primitive and more\r\nsober colours of the group for purposes of protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Concluding Remarks._\r\n\r\nThe general principles of colour development now sketched out enable us\r\nto give some rational explanation of the wonderful amount of brilliant\r\ncolour which occurs among tropical animals. Looking on colour as a\r\nnormal product of organisation, which has either been allowed free play,\r\nor has been checked and modified for the benefit of the species, we can\r\nsee at once that the luxuriant and perennial vegetation of the tropics,\r\nby affording much more constant means of concealment, has rendered\r\nbrilliant colour less hurtful there than in the temperate and colder\r\nregions. Again, this perennial vegetation supplies abundance of both\r\nvegetable and insect food throughout the year, and thus a greater\r\nabundance and greater variety of the forms of life are rendered\r\npossible, than where recurrent seasons of cold and scarcity reduce the\r\npossibilities of life to a minimum. Geology furnishes us with another\r\nreason, in the fact, that throughout the tertiary period tropical\r\nconditions prevailed far into the temperate regions, so that the\r\npossibilities of colour development were still greater than they are at\r\nthe present time. The tropics, therefore, present to us the results of\r\nanimal development in a much larger area and under more favourable\r\nconditions than prevail to-day. We see in them samples of the\r\nproductions of an earlier and a better world, from an animal point of\r\nview; and this probably gives a greater variety and a finer display of\r\ncolour than would have been produced, had conditions always been what\r\nthey are now. The temperate zones, on the other hand, have recently\r\nsuffered the effects of a glacial period of extreme severity, with the\r\nresult that almost the only gay coloured birds they now possess are\r\nsummer visitors from tropical or sub-tropical lands. It is to the\r\nunbroken and almost unchecked course of development from remote\r\ngeological times that has prevailed in the tropics, favoured by abundant\r\nfood and perennial shelter, that we owe such superb developments as the\r\nfrills and crests and jewelled shields of the humming-birds, the golden\r\nplumes of the birds of paradise, and the resplendent train of the\r\npeacock. This last exhibits to us the culmination of that marvel and\r\nmystery of animal colour which is so well expressed by a poet-artist in\r\nthe following lines. The marvel will ever remain to the sympathetic\r\nstudent of nature, but I venture to hope that in the preceding chapters\r\nI have succeeded in lifting--if only by one of its corners--the veil of\r\nmystery which has for long shrouded this department of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On a Peacock's Feather._\r\n\r\n    In Nature's workshop but a shaving,\r\n      Of her poem but a word,\r\n    But a tint brushed from her palette,\r\n      This feather of a bird!\r\n    Yet set it in the sun glance,\r\n      Display it in the shine,\r\n    Take graver's lens, explore it,\r\n      Note filament and line,\r\n    Mark amethyst to sapphire,\r\n      And sapphire to gold,\r\n    And gold to emerald changing\r\n      The archetype unfold!\r\n    Tone, tint, thread, tissue, texture,\r\n      Through every atom scan,\r\n    Conforming still, developing,\r\n      Obedient to plan.\r\n    This but to form a pattern\r\n      On the garment of a bird!\r\n    What then must be the poem,\r\n      This but its lightest word!\r\n    Sit before it; ponder o'er it,\r\n      'Twill thy mind advantage more,\r\n    Than a treatise, than a sermon,\r\n      Than a library of lore.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: Darwin's _Descent of Man_, p. 271.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 119: Darwin's _Descent of Man_, p. 294, and footnote.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 120: _Nature_, 1871, p. 489.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 121: Darwin in _Nature_, 1880, p. 237.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 122: See the author's _Contributions to Natural Selection_,\r\nchap. vii. in which these facts were first brought forward.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 123: On this point see the author's _Contributions to Natural\r\nSelection_, chap. v. i.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 124: Seebohm's _History of British Birds_, vol. ii.,\r\nintroduction, p. xiii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 125: For details see Darwin's _Descent of Man_, chap. xii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 126: _Descent of Man_, pp. 417, 418, 420.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: _Notes of a Naturalist on the Challenger._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128: _Descent of Man_, pp. 401, 402.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: _Coloration in Animals and Plants_, London, 1886.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130: _Coloration of Animals_, Pl.

Pickard-Cambridge, who has devoted himself to\r\nthe study of spiders, has kindly sent me the following extract from a\r\nletter, written in 1869, in which he states his views on this\r\nquestion:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I myself doubt that particular application of the Darwinian\r\n    theory which attributes male peculiarities of form, structure,\r\n    colour, and ornament to female appetency or predilection. There\r\n    is, it seems to me, undoubtedly something in the male\r\n    organisation of a special, and sexual nature, which, of its own\r\n    vital force, develops the remarkable male peculiarities so\r\n    commonly seen, and of no imaginable use to that sex. In as far\r\n    as these peculiarities show a great vital power, they point out\r\n    to us the finest and strongest individuals of the sex, and show\r\n    us which of them would most certainly appropriate to themselves\r\n    the best and greatest number of females, and leave behind them\r\n    the strongest and greatest number of progeny. And here would\r\n    come in, as it appears to me, the proper application of Darwin's\r\n    theory of Natural Selection; for the possessors of greatest\r\n    vital power being those most frequently produced and reproduced,\r\n    the external signs of it would go on developing in an\r\n    ever-increasing exaggeration, only to be checked where it became\r\n    really detrimental in some respect or other to the individual.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis passage, giving the independent views of a close observer--one,\r\nmoreover, who has studied the species of an extensive group of animals\r\nboth in the field and in the laboratory--very nearly accords with my own\r\nconclusions above given; and, so far as the matured opinions of a\r\ncompetent naturalist have any weight, afford them an important support.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE SPECIAL COLOURS OF PLANTS: THEIR ORIGIN AND PURPOSE\r\n\r\n\r\n    The general colour relations of plants--Colours of fruits--The\r\n    meaning of nuts--Edible or attractive fruits--The colours of\r\n    flowers--Modes of securing cross-fertilisation--The\r\n    interpretation of the facts--Summary of additional facts bearing\r\n    on insect fertilisation--Fertilisation of flowers by\r\n    birds--Self-fertilisation of flowers--Difficulties and\r\n    contradictions--Intercrossing not necessarily\r\n    advantageous--Supposed evil results of close interbreeding--How\r\n    the struggle for existence acts among flowers--Flowers the\r\n    product of insect agency--Concluding remarks on colour in\r\n    nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe colours of plants are both less definite and less complex than are\r\nthose of animals, and their interpretation on the principle of utility\r\nis, on the whole, more direct and more easy. Yet here, too, we find that\r\nin our investigation of the uses of the various colours of fruits and\r\nflowers, we are introduced to some of the most obscure recesses of\r\nnature's workshop, and are confronted with problems of the deepest\r\ninterest and of the utmost complexity.\r\n\r\nSo much has been written on this interesting subject since Mr. Darwin\r\nfirst called attention to it, and its main facts have become so\r\ngenerally known by means of lectures, articles, and popular books, that\r\nI shall give here a mere outline sketch, for the purpose of leading up\r\nto a discussion of some of the more fundamental problems which arise out\r\nof the facts, and which have hitherto received less attention than they\r\ndeserve.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The General Colour Relations of Plants._\r\n\r\nThe green colour of the foliage of leafy plants is due to the existence\r\nof a substance called chlorophyll, which is almost universally developed\r\nin the leaves under the action of light. It is subject to definite\r\nchemical changes during the processes of growth and of decay, and it is\r\nowing to these changes that we have the delicate tints of spring\r\nfoliage, and the more varied, intense, and gorgeous hues of autumn. But\r\nthese all belong to the class of intrinsic or normal colours, due to the\r\nchemical constitution of the organism; as colours they are unadaptive,\r\nand appear to have no more relation to the wellbeing of the plants\r\nthemselves than have the colours of gems and minerals. We may also\r\ninclude in the same category those algae and fungi which have bright\r\ncolours--the \"red snow\" of the arctic regions, the red, green, or purple\r\nseaweeds, the brilliant scarlet, yellow, white, or black agarics, and\r\nother fungi. All these colours are probably the direct results of\r\nchemical composition or molecular structure, and, being thus normal\r\nproducts of the vegetable organism, need no special explanation from our\r\npresent point of view; and the same remark will apply to the varied\r\ntints of the bark of trunks, branches, and twigs, which are often of\r\nvarious shades of brown and green, or even vivid reds or yellows.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, a few cases in which the need of protection, which\r\nwe have found to be so important an agency in modifying the colours of\r\nanimals, has also determined those of some of the smaller members of the\r\nvegetable kingdom. Dr. Burchell found a mesembryanthomum in South Africa\r\nlike a curiously shaped pebble, closely resembling the stones among\r\nwhich it grew;[136] and Mr. J.P. Mansel Weale states that in the same\r\ncountry one of the Asclepiadeae has tubers growing above ground among\r\nstones which they exactly resemble, and that, when not in leaf, they are\r\nfor this reason quite invisible.[137] It is clear that such resemblances\r\nmust be highly useful to these plants, inhabiting an arid country\r\nabounding in herbivorous mammalia, which, in times of drought or\r\nscarcity, will devour everything in the shape of a fleshy stem or tuber.\r\n\r\nTrue mimicry is very rare in plants, though adaptation to like\r\nconditions often produces in foliage and habit a similarity that is\r\ndeceiving. Euphorbias growing in deserts often closely resemble cacti.\r\nSeaside plants and high alpine plants of different orders are often much\r\nalike; and innumerable resemblances of this kind are recorded in the\r\nnames of plants, as Veronica epacridea (the veronica like an epacris),\r\nLimnanthemum nymphaeoides (the limnanthemum like a nymphaea), the\r\nresembling species in each case belonging to totally distinct families.\r\nBut in these cases, and in most others that have been observed, the\r\nessential features of true mimicry are absent, inasmuch as the one plant\r\ncannot be supposed to derive any benefit from its close resemblance to\r\nthe other, and this is still more certain from the fact that the two\r\nspecies usually inhabit different localities. A few cases exist,\r\nhowever, in which there does seem to be the necessary accordance and\r\nutility. Mr. Mansel Weale mentions a labiate plant (Ajuga ophrydis), the\r\nonly species of the genus Ajuga in South Africa, which is strikingly\r\nlike an orchid of the same country; while a balsam (Impatiens capensis),\r\nalso a solitary species of the genus in that country, is equally like an\r\norchid, growing in the same locality and visited by the same insects. As\r\nboth these genera of plants are specialised for insect fertilisation,\r\nand both of the plants in question are isolated species of their\r\nrespective genera, we may suppose that, when they first reached South\r\nAfrica they were neglected by the insects of the country; but, being\r\nboth remotely like orchids in form of flower, those varieties that\r\napproached nearest to the familiar species of the country were visited\r\nby insects and cross-fertilised, and thus a closer resemblance would at\r\nlength be brought about. Another case of close general resemblance, is\r\nthat of our common white dead-nettle (Lamium album) to the\r\nstinging-nettle (Urtica dioica); and Sir John Lubbock thinks that this\r\nis a case of true mimicry, the dead-nettle being benefited by being\r\nmistaken by grazing animals for the stinging-nettle.[138]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Colours of Fruits._\r\n\r\nIt is when we come to the essential parts of plants on which their\r\nperpetuation and distribution depends, that we find colour largely\r\nutilised for a distinct purpose in flowers and fruits. In the former we\r\nfind attractive colours and guiding marks to secure cross-fertilisation\r\nby insects; in the latter attractive or protective coloration, the first\r\nto attract birds or other animals when the fruits are intended to be\r\neaten, the second to enable them to escape being eaten when it would be\r\ninjurious to the species. The colour phenomena of fruits being much the\r\nmost simple will be considered first.\r\n\r\nThe perpetuation and therefore the very existence of each species of\r\nflowering plant depend upon its seeds being preserved from destruction\r\nand more or less effectually dispersed over a considerable area. The\r\ndispersal is effected either mechanically or by the agency of animals.\r\nMechanical dispersal is chiefly by means of air-currents, and large\r\nnumbers of seeds are specially adapted to be so carried, either by being\r\nclothed with down or pappus, as in the well-known thistle and dandelion\r\nseeds; by having wings or other appendages, as in the sycamore, birch,\r\nand many other trees; by being thrown to a considerable distance by the\r\nsplitting of the seed-vessel, and by many other curious devices.[139]\r\nVery large numbers of seeds, however, are so small and light that they\r\ncan be carried enormous distances by gales of wind, more especially as\r\nmost of this kind are flattened or curved, so as to expose a large\r\nsurface in proportion to their weight. Those which are carried by\r\nanimals have their surfaces, or that of the seed-vessel, armed with\r\nminute hooks, or some prickly covering which attaches itself to the hair\r\nof mammalia or the feathers of birds, as in the burdock, cleavers, and\r\nmany other species. Others again are sticky, as in Plumbago europaea,\r\nmistletoe, and many foreign plants.\r\n\r\nAll the seeds or seed-vessels which are adapted to be dispersed in any\r\nof these ways are of dull protective tints, so that when they fall on\r\nthe ground they are almost indistinguishable; besides which, they are\r\nusually small, hard, and altogether unattractive, never having any\r\nsoft, juicy pulp; while the edible seeds often bear such a small\r\nproportion to the hard, dry envelopes or appendages, that few animals\r\nwould care to eat them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Meaning of Nuts._\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another class of fruits or seeds, usually termed\r\nnuts, in which there is a large amount of edible matter, often very\r\nagreeable to the taste, and especially attractive and nourishing to a\r\nlarge number of animals. But when eaten, the seed is destroyed and the\r\nexistence of the species endangered. It is evident, therefore, that it\r\nis by a kind of accident that these nuts are eatable; and that they are\r\nnot intended to be eaten is shown by the special care nature seems to\r\nhave taken to conceal or to protect them. We see that all our common\r\nnuts are green when on the tree, so as not easily to be distinguished\r\nfrom the leaves; but when ripe they turn brown, so that when they fall\r\non to the ground they are equally indistinguishable among the dead\r\nleaves and twigs, or on the brown earth. Then they are almost always\r\nprotected by hard coverings, as in hazel-nuts, which are concealed by\r\nthe enlarged leafy involucre, and in the large tropical brazil-nuts and\r\ncocoa-nuts by such a hard and tough case as to be safe from almost every\r\nanimal. Others have an external bitter rind, as in the walnut; while in\r\nthe chestnuts and beech-nuts two or three fruits are enclosed in a\r\nprickly involucre.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all these precautions, nuts are largely devoured by\r\nmammalia and birds; but as they are chiefly the product of trees or\r\nshrubs of considerable longevity, and are generally produced in great\r\nprofusion, the perpetuation of the species is not endangered. In some\r\ncases the devourers of nuts may aid in their dispersal, as they probably\r\nnow and then swallow the seed whole, or not sufficiently crushed to\r\nprevent germination; while squirrels have been observed to bury nuts,\r\nmany of which are forgotten and afterwards grow in places they could not\r\nhave otherwise reached.[140] Nuts, especially the larger kinds which are\r\nso well protected by their hard, nearly globular cases, have their\r\ndispersal facilitated by rolling down hill, and more especially by\r\nfloating in rivers and lakes, and thus reaching other localities. During\r\nthe elevation of land areas this method would be very effective, as the\r\nnew land would always be at a lower level than that already covered with\r\nvegetation, and therefore in the best position for being stocked with\r\nplants from it.\r\n\r\nThe other modes of dispersal of seeds are so clearly adapted to their\r\nspecial wants, that we feel sure they must have been acquired by the\r\nprocess of variation and natural selection. The hooked and sticky seeds\r\nare always those of such herbaceous plants as are likely, from their\r\nsize, to come in contact with the wool of sheep or the hair of cattle;\r\nwhile seeds of this kind never occur on forest trees, on aquatic plants,\r\nor even on very dwarf creepers or trailers. The winged seed-vessels or\r\nseeds, on the other hand, mostly belong to trees and to tall shrubs or\r\nclimbers. We have, therefore, a very exact adaptation to conditions in\r\nthese different modes of dispersal; while, when we come to consider\r\nindividual cases, we find innumerable other adaptations, some of which\r\nthe reader will find described in the little work by Sir John Lubbock\r\nalready referred to.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edible or Attractive Fruits._\r\n\r\nIt is, however, when we come to true fruits (in a popular sense) that we\r\nfind varied colours evidently intended to attract animals, in order that\r\nthe fruits may be eaten, while the seeds pass through the body\r\nundigested and are then in the fittest state for germination. This end\r\nhas been gained in a great variety of ways, and with so many\r\ncorresponding adaptations as to leave no doubt as to the value of the\r\nresult. Fruits are pulpy or juicy, and usually sweet, and form the\r\nfavourite food of innumerable birds and some mammals. They are always\r\ncoloured so as to contrast with the foliage or surroundings, red being\r\nthe most common as it is certainly the most conspicuous colour, but\r\nyellow, purple, black, or white being not uncommon. The edible portion\r\nof fruits is developed from different parts of the floral envelopes, or\r\nof the ovary, in the various orders and genera. Sometimes the calyx\r\nbecomes enlarged and fleshy, as in the apple and pear tribe; more often\r\nthe integuments of the ovary itself are enlarged, as in the plum, peach,\r\ngrape, etc.; the receptacle is enlarged and forms the fruit of the\r\nstrawberry; while the mulberry, pineapple, and fig are examples of\r\ncompound fruits formed in various ways from a dense mass of flowers.\r\n\r\nIn all cases the seeds themselves are protected from injury by various\r\ndevices. They are small and hard in the strawberry, raspberry, currant,\r\netc., and are readily swallowed among the copious pulp. In the grape\r\nthey are hard and bitter; in the rose (hip) disagreeably hairy; in the\r\norange tribe very bitter; and all these have a smooth, glutinous\r\nexterior which facilitates their being swallowed. When the seeds are\r\nlarger and are eatable, they are enclosed in an excessively hard and\r\nthick covering, as in the various kinds of \"stone\" fruit (plums,\r\npeaches, etc.), or in a very tough core, as in the apple. In the nutmeg\r\nof the Eastern Archipelago we have a curious adaptation to a single\r\ngroup of birds. The fruit is yellow, somewhat like an oval peach, but\r\nfirm and hardly eatable. This splits open and shows the glossy black\r\ncovering of the seed or nutmeg, over which spreads the bright scarlet\r\narillus or \"mace,\" an adventitious growth of no use to the plant except\r\nto attract attention. Large fruit pigeons pluck out this seed and\r\nswallow it entire for the sake of the mace, while the large nutmeg\r\npasses through their bodies and germinates; and this has led to the wide\r\ndistribution of wild nutmegs over New Guinea and the surrounding\r\nislands.\r\n\r\nIn the restriction of bright colour to those edible fruits the eating of\r\nwhich is beneficial to the plant, we see the undoubted result of natural\r\nselection; and this is the more evident when we find that the colour\r\nnever appears till the fruit is ripe--that is, till the seeds within it\r\nare fully matured and in the best state for germination. Some\r\nbrilliantly coloured fruits are poisonous, as in our bitter-sweet\r\n(Solanum dulcamara), cuckoo-pint (Arum) and the West Indian manchineel.\r\nMany of these are, no doubt, eaten by animals to whom they are harmless;\r\nand it has been suggested that even if some animals are poisoned by them\r\nthe plant is benefited, since it not only gets dispersed, but finds, in\r\nthe decaying body of its victim, a rich manure heap.[141] The particular\r\ncolours of fruits are not, so far as we know, of any use to them other\r\nthan as regards conspicuousness, hence a tendency to _any_ decided\r\ncolour has been preserved and accumulated as serving to render the fruit\r\neasily visible among its surroundings of leaves or herbage. Out of 134\r\nfruit-bearing plants in Mongredien's _Trees and Shrubs_, and Hooker's\r\n_British Flora_, the fruits of no less than sixty-eight, or rather more\r\nthan half, are red, forty-five are black, fourteen yellow, and seven\r\nwhite. The great prevalence of red fruits is almost certainly due to\r\ntheir greater conspicuousness having favoured their dispersal, though it\r\nmay also have arisen in part from the chemical changes of chlorophyll\r\nduring ripening and decay producing red tints as in many fading leaves.\r\nYet the comparative scarcity of yellow in fruits, while it is the most\r\ncommon tint of fading leaves, is against this supposition.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, a few instances of coloured fruits which do not seem\r\nto be intended to be eaten; such are the colocynth plant (Cucumis\r\ncolocynthus), which has a beautiful fruit the size and colour of an\r\norange, but nauseous beyond description to the taste. It has a hard\r\nrind, and may perhaps be dispersed by being blown along the ground, the\r\ncolour being an adventitious product; but it is quite possible,\r\nnotwithstanding its repulsiveness to us, that it may be eaten by some\r\nanimals. With regard to the fruit of another plant, Calotropis procera,\r\nthere is less doubt, as it is dry and full of thin, flat-winged seeds,\r\nwith fine silky filaments, eminently adapted for wind-dispersal; yet it\r\nis of a bright yellow colour, as large as an apple, and therefore very\r\nconspicuous. Here, therefore, we seem to have colour which is a mere\r\nbyproduct of the organism and of no use to it; but such cases are\r\nexceedingly rare, and this rarity, when compared with the great\r\nabundance of cases in which there is an obvious purpose in the colour,\r\nadds weight to the evidence in favour of the theory of the attractive\r\ncoloration of edible fruits in order that birds and other animals may\r\nassist in their dispersal. Both the above-named plants are natives of\r\nPalestine and the adjacent arid countries.[142]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Colours of Flowers._\r\n\r\nFlowers are much more varied in their colours than fruits, as they are\r\nmore complex and more varied in form and structure; yet there is some\r\nparallelism between them in both respects. Flowers are frequently\r\nadapted to attract insects as fruits are to attract birds, the object\r\nbeing in the former to secure cross-fertilisation, in the latter\r\ndispersal; while just as colour is an index of the edibility of fruits\r\nwhich supply pulp or juice to birds, so are the colours of flowers an\r\nindication of the presence of nectar or of pollen which are devoured by\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nThe main facts and many of the details, as to the relation of insects to\r\nflowers, were discovered by Sprengel in 1793. He noticed the curious\r\nadaptation of the structure of many flowers to the particular insects\r\nwhich visit them; he proved that insects do cross-fertilise flowers, and\r\nhe believed that this was the object of the adaptations, while the\r\npresence of nectar and pollen ensured the continuance of their visits;\r\nyet he missed discovering the _use_ of this cross-fertilisation. Several\r\nwriters at a later period obtained evidence that cross-fertilisation of\r\nplants was a benefit to them; but the wide generality of this fact and\r\nits intimate connection with the numerous and curious adaptations\r\ndiscovered by Sprengel, was first shown by Mr. Darwin, and has since\r\nbeen demonstrated by a vast mass of observations, foremost among which\r\nare his own researches on orchids, primulas, and other plants.[143]\r\n\r\nBy an elaborate series of experiments carried on for many years Mr.\r\nDarwin demonstrated the great value of cross-fertilisation in increasing\r\nthe rapidity of growth, the strength and vigour of the plant, and in\r\nadding to its fertility. This effect is produced immediately, not as he\r\nexpected would be the case, after several generations of crosses. He\r\nplanted seeds from cross-fertilised and self-fertilised plants on two\r\nsides of the same pot exposed to exactly similar conditions, and in most\r\ncases the difference in size and vigour was amazing, while the plants\r\nfrom cross-fertilised parents also produced more and finer seeds. These\r\nexperiments entirely confirmed the experience of breeders of animals\r\nalready referred to (p. 160), and led him to enunciate his famous\r\naphorism, \"Nature abhors perpetual self-fertilisation\".[144] In this\r\nprinciple we appear to have a sufficient reason for the various\r\ncontrivances by which so many flowers secure cross-fertilisation, either\r\nconstantly or occasionally. These contrivances are so numerous, so\r\nvaried, and often so highly complex and extraordinary, that they have\r\nformed the subject of many elaborate treatises, and have also been amply\r\npopularised in lectures and handbooks. It will be unnecessary,\r\ntherefore, to give details here, but the main facts will be summarised\r\nin order to call attention to some difficulties of the theory which seem\r\nto require further elucidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Modes of securing Cross-Fertilisation._\r\n\r\nWhen we examine the various modes in which the cross-fertilisation of\r\nflowers is brought about, we find that some are comparatively simple in\r\ntheir operation and needful adjustments, others highly complex. The\r\nsimple methods belong to four principal classes:--(1) By dichogamy--that\r\nis, by the anthers and the stigma becoming mature or in a fit state for\r\nfertilisation at slightly different times on the same plant. The result\r\nof this is that, as plants in different stations, on different soils, or\r\nexposed to different aspects flower earlier or later, the mature pollen\r\nof one plant can only fertilise some plant exposed to somewhat different\r\nconditions or of different constitution, whose stigma will be mature at\r\nthe same time; and this difference has been shown by Darwin to be that\r\nwhich is adapted to secure the fullest benefit of cross-fertilisation.\r\nThis occurs in Geranium pratense, Thymus serpyllum, Arum maculatum, and\r\nmany others. (2) By the flower being self-sterile with its own pollen,\r\nas in the crimson flax. This absolutely prevents self-fertilisation. (3)\r\nBy the stamens and anthers being so placed that the pollen cannot fall\r\nupon the stigma, while it does fall upon a visiting insect which carries\r\nit to the stigma of another flower. This effect is produced in a variety\r\nof very simple ways, and is often aided by the motion of the stamens\r\nwhich bend down out of the way of the stigmas before the pollen is ripe,\r\nas in Malva sylvestris (see Fig. 28). (4) By the male and female flowers\r\nbeing on different plants, forming the class Dioecia of Linnaeus. In\r\nthese cases the pollen may be carried to the stigmas either by the wind\r\nor by the agency of insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.\r\n\r\nMalva sylvestris, adapted for insect-fertilisation.\r\n\r\nMalva rotundifolia, adapted for self-fertilisation.]\r\n\r\nNow these four methods are all apparently very simple, and easily\r\nproduced by variation and selection. They are applicable to flowers of\r\nany shape, requiring only such size and colour as to attract insects,\r\nand some secretion of nectar to ensure their repeated visits, characters\r\ncommon to the great majority of flowers. All these methods are common,\r\nexcept perhaps the second; but there are many flowers in which the\r\npollen from another plant is prepotent over the pollen from\r\nfertilisation, the same flower, and this has nearly the same effect as\r\nself-sterility if the flowers are frequently crossed by insects. We\r\ncannot help asking, therefore, why have other and much more elaborate\r\nmethods been needed? And how have the more complex arrangements of so\r\nmany flowers been brought about? Before attempting to answer these\r\nquestions, and in order that the reader may appreciate the difficulty of\r\nthe problem and the nature of the facts to be explained, it will be\r\nnecessary to give a summary of the more elaborate modes of securing\r\ncross-fertilisation.\r\n\r\n(1) We first have dimorphism and heteromorphism, the phenomena of which\r\nhave been already sketched in our seventh chapter.\r\n\r\nHere we have both a mechanical and a physiological modification, the\r\nstamens and pistil being variously modified in length and position,\r\nwhile the different stamens in the same flower have widely different\r\ndegrees of fertility when applied to the same stigma,--a phenomenon\r\nwhich, if it were not so well established, would have appeared in the\r\nhighest degree improbable. The most remarkable case is that of the three\r\ndifferent forms of the loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) here figured\r\n(Fig. 29 on next page).\r\n\r\n(2) Some flowers have irritable stamens which, when their bases are\r\ntouched by an insect, spring up and dust it with pollen. This occurs in\r\nour common berberry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--Lythrum salicaria (Purple loosestrife).]\r\n\r\n(3) In others there are levers or processes by which the anthers are\r\nmechanically brought down on to the head or back of an insect entering\r\nthe flower, in such a position as to be carried to the stigma of the\r\nnext flower it visits. This may be well seen in many species of Salvia\r\nand Erica.\r\n\r\n(4) In some there is a sticky secretion which, getting on to the\r\nproboscis of an insect, carries away the pollen, and applies it to the\r\nstigma of another flower. This occurs in our common milkwort (Polygala\r\nvulgaris).\r\n\r\n(5) In papilionaceous plants there are many complex adjustments, such as\r\nthe squeezing out of pollen from a receptacle on to an insect, as in\r\nLotus corniculatus, or the sudden springing out and exploding of the\r\nanthers so as thoroughly to dust the insect, as in Medicago falcata,\r\nthis occurring after the stigma has touched the insect and taken off\r\nsome pollen from the last flower.\r\n\r\n(6) Some flowers or spathes form closed boxes in which insects find\r\nthemselves entrapped, and when they have fertilised the flower, the\r\nfringe of hairs opens and allows them to escape. This occurs in many\r\nspecies of Arum and Aristolochia.\r\n\r\n(7) Still more remarkable are the traps in the flower of Asclepias which\r\ncatch flies, butterflies, and wasps by the legs, and the wonderfully\r\ncomplex arrangements of the orchids. One of these, our common Orchis\r\npyramidalis, may be briefly described to show how varied and beautiful\r\nare the arrangements to secure cross-fertilisation. The broad trifid lip\r\nof the flower offers a support to the moth which is attracted by its\r\nsweet odour, and two ridges at the base guide the proboscis with\r\ncertainty to the narrow entrance of the nectary. When the proboscis has\r\nreached the end of the spur, its basal portion depresses the little\r\nhinged rostellum that covers the saddle-shaped sticky glands to which\r\nthe pollen masses (pollinia) are attached. On the proboscis being\r\nwithdrawn, the two pollinia stand erect and parallel, firmly attached to\r\nthe proboscis. In this position, however, they would be useless, as they\r\nwould miss the stigmatic surface of the next flower visited by the moth.\r\nBut as soon as the proboscis is withdrawn, the two pollen masses begin\r\nto diverge till they are exactly as far apart as are the stigmas of the\r\nflower; and then commences a second movement which brings them down\r\ntill they project straight forward nearly at right angles to their first\r\nposition, so as exactly to hit against the stigmatic surfaces of the\r\nnext flower visited on which they leave a portion of their pollen. The\r\nwhole of these motions take about half a minute, and in that time the\r\nmoth will usually have flown to another plant, and thus effect the most\r\nbeneficial kind of cross-fertilisation.[145] This description will be\r\nbetter understood by referring to the illustration opposite, from\r\nDarwin's _Fertilisation of Orchids_(Fig. 30).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--Orchis pyramidalis.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Interpretation of these Facts._\r\n\r\nHaving thus briefly indicated the general character of the more complex\r\nadaptations for cross-fertilisation, the details of which are to be\r\nfound in any of the numerous works on the subject,[146] we find\r\nourselves confronted with the very puzzling question--Why were these\r\ninnumerable highly complex adaptations produced, when the very same\r\nresult may be effected--and often is effected--by extremely simple\r\nmeans? Supposing, as we must do, that all flowers were once of simple\r\nand regular forms, like a buttercup or a rose, how did such irregular\r\nand often complicated flowers as the papilionaceous or pea family, the\r\nlabiates or sage family, and the infinitely varied and fantastic orchids\r\never come into existence? No cause has yet been suggested but the need\r\nof attracting insects to cross-fertilise them; yet the attractiveness of\r\nregular flowers with bright colours and an ample supply of nectar is\r\nequally great, and cross-fertilisation can be quite as effectively\r\nsecured in these by any of the four simple methods already described.\r\nBefore attempting to suggest a possible solution of this difficult\r\nproblem, we have yet to pass in review a large body of curious\r\nadaptations connected with insect fertilisation, and will first call\r\nattention to that portion of the phenomena which throw some light upon\r\nthe special colours of flowers in their relation to the various kinds of\r\ninsects which visit them. For these facts we are largely indebted to\r\nthe exact and long-continued researches of Professor Hermann Müller.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Summary of Additional Facts bearing on Insect Fertilisation._\r\n\r\n1. That the size and colour of a flower are important factors in\r\ndetermining the visits of insects, is shown by the general fact of more\r\ninsects visiting conspicuous than inconspicuous flowers. As a single\r\ninstance, the handsome Geranium palustre was observed by Professor\r\nMüller to be visited by sixteen different species of insects, the\r\nequally showy G. pratense by thirteen species, while the smaller and\r\nmuch less conspicuous G. molle was visited by eight species, and G.\r\npusillum by only one. In many cases, however, a flower may be very\r\nattractive to only a few species of insects; and Professor Müller\r\nstates, as the result of many years' assiduous observation, that \"a\r\nspecies of flower is the more visited by insects the more conspicuous it\r\nis.\"\r\n\r\n2. Sweet odour is usually supplementary to the attraction of colour.\r\nThus it is rarely present in the largest and most gaudily coloured\r\nflowers which inhabit open places, such as poppies, paeonies,\r\nsunflowers, and many others; while it is often the accompaniment of\r\ninconspicuous flowers, as the mignonette; of such as grow in shady\r\nplaces, as the violet and primrose; and especially of white or yellowish\r\nflowers, as the white jasmine, clematis, stephanotis, etc.\r\n\r\n3. White flowers are often fertilised by moths, and very frequently give\r\nout their scent only by night, as in our butterfly-orchis (Habenaria\r\nchlorantha); and they sometimes open only at night, as do many of the\r\nevening primroses and other flowers. These flowers are often long tubed\r\nin accordance with the length of the moths' probosces, as in the genus\r\nPancratium, our butterfly orchis, white jasmine, and a host of others.\r\n\r\n4. Bright red flowers are very attractive to butterflies, and are\r\nsometimes specially adapted to be fertilised by them, as in many pinks\r\n(Dianthus deltoides, D. superbus, D. atrorubens), the corn-cockle\r\n(Lychnis Githago), and many others. Blue flowers are especially\r\nattractive to bees and other hymenoptera (though they frequent flowers\r\nof all colours), no less than sixty-seven species of this order having\r\nbeen observed to visit the common \"sheep's-bit\" (Jasione montana). Dull\r\nyellow or brownish flowers, some of which smell like carrion, are\r\nattractive to flies, as the Arum and Aristolochia; while the dull\r\npurplish flowers of the Scrophularia are specially attractive to wasps.\r\n\r\n5. Some flowers have neither scent nor nectar, and yet attract insects\r\nby sham nectaries! In the herb-paris (Paris quadrifolia) the ovary\r\nglistens as if moist, and flies alight on it and carry away pollen to\r\nanother flower; while in grass of parnassus (Parnassia palustris) there\r\nare a number of small stalked yellow balls near the base of the flower,\r\nwhich look like drops of honey but are really dry. In this case there is\r\na little nectar lower down, but the special attraction is a sham; and as\r\nthere are fresh broods of insects every year, it takes time for them to\r\nlearn by experience, and thus enough are always deceived to effect\r\ncross-fertilisation.[147] This is analogous to the case of the young\r\nbirds, which have to learn by experience the insects that are inedible,\r\nas explained at page 253.\r\n\r\n6. Many flowers change their colour as soon as fertilised; and this is\r\nbeneficial, as it enables bees to avoid wasting time in visiting those\r\nblossoms which have been already fertilised and their nectar exhausted.\r\nThe common lungwort (Pulmonaria officinalis), is at first red, but later\r\nturns blue; and H. Müller observed bees visiting many red flowers in\r\nsuccession, but neglecting the blue. In South Brazil there is a species\r\nof Lantana, whose flowers are yellow the first day, orange the second,\r\nand purple the third; and Dr. Fritz Müller observed that many\r\nbutterflies visited the yellow flowers only, some both the yellow and\r\nthe orange flowers, but none the purple.\r\n\r\n7. Many flowers have markings which serve as guides to insects; in some\r\ncases a bright central eye, as in the borage and forget-me-not; or lines\r\nor spots converging to the centre, as in geraniums, pinks, and many\r\nothers. This enables insects to go quickly and directly to the opening\r\nof the flower, and is equally important in aiding them to obtain a\r\nbetter supply of food, and to fertilise a larger number of flowers.\r\n\r\n8. Flowers have been specially adapted to the kinds of insects that\r\nmost abound where they grow. Thus the gentians of the lowlands are\r\nadapted to bees, those of the high alps to butterflies only; and while\r\nmost species of Rhinanthus (a genus to which our common \"yellow rattle\"\r\nbelongs) are bee-flowers, one high alpine species (R. alpinus) has been\r\nalso adapted for fertilisation by butterflies only. The reason of this\r\nis, that in the high alps butterflies are immensely more plentiful than\r\nbees, and flowers adapted to be fertilised by bees can often have their\r\nnectar extracted by butterflies without effecting cross-fertilisation.\r\nIt is, therefore, important to have a modification of structure which\r\nshall make butterflies the fertilisers, and this in many cases has been\r\ndone.[148]\r\n\r\n9. Economy of time is very important both to the insects and the\r\nflowers, because the fine working days are comparatively few, and if no\r\ntime is wasted the bees will get more honey, and in doing so will\r\nfertilise more flowers. Now, it has been ascertained by several\r\nobservers that many insects, bees especially, keep to one kind of flower\r\nat a time, visiting hundreds of blossoms in succession, and passing over\r\nother species that may be mixed with them. They thus acquire quickness\r\nin going at once to the nectar, and the change of colour in the flower,\r\nor incipient withering when fertilised, enables them to avoid those\r\nflowers that have already had their honey exhausted. It is probably to\r\nassist the insects in keeping to one flower at a time, which is of vital\r\nimportance to the perpetuation of the species, that the flowers which\r\nbloom intermingled at the same season are usually very distinct both in\r\nform and colour. In the sandy districts of Surrey, in the early spring,\r\nthe copses are gay with three flowers--the primrose, the wood-anemone,\r\nand the lesser celandine, forming a beautiful contrast, while at the\r\nsame time the purple and the white dead-nettles abound on hedge banks. A\r\nlittle later, in the same copses, we have the blue wild hyacinth (Scilla\r\nnutans), the red campion (Lychnis dioica), the pure white great starwort\r\n(Stellaria Holosteum), and the yellow dead-nettle (Lamium Galeobdolon),\r\nall distinct and well-contrasted flowers. In damp meadows in summer we\r\nhave the ragged robin (Lychnis Floscuculi), the spotted orchis (O.\r\nmaculata), and the yellow rattle (Rhinanthus Crista-galli); while in\r\ndrier meadows we have cowslips, ox-eye daisies, and buttercups, all very\r\ndistinct both in form and colour. So in cornfields we have the scarlet\r\npoppies, the purple corn-cockle, the yellow corn-marygold, and the blue\r\ncornflower; while on our moors the purple heath and the dwarf gorse make\r\na gorgeous contrast. Thus the difference of colour which enables the\r\ninsect to visit with rapidity and unerring aim a number of flowers of\r\nthe same kind in succession, serves to adorn our meadows, banks, woods,\r\nand heaths with a charming variety of floral colour and form at each\r\nseason of the year.[149]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fertilisation of Flowers by Birds._\r\n\r\nIn the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, insects are the\r\nchief agents in cross-fertilisation when this is not effected by the\r\nwind; but in warmer regions, and in the Southern hemisphere, birds are\r\nfound to take a considerable part in the operation, and have in many\r\ncases led to modifications in the form and colour of flowers. Each part\r\nof the globe has special groups of birds which are flower-haunters.\r\nAmerica has the humming-birds (Trochilidae), and the smaller group of\r\nthe sugar-birds (Caerebidae). In the Eastern tropics the sun-birds\r\n(Nectarineidae) take the place of the humming-birds, and another small\r\ngroup, the flower-peckers (Dicaeidae), assist them. In the Australian\r\nregion there are also two flower-feeding groups, the Meliphagidae, or\r\nhoney-suckers, and the brush-tongued lories (Trichoglossidae). Recent\r\nresearches by American naturalists have shown that many flowers are\r\nfertilised by humming-birds, such as passion-flowers, trumpet-flowers,\r\nfuchsias, and lobelias; while some, as the Salvia splendens of Mexico,\r\nare specially adapted to their visits. We may thus perhaps explain the\r\nnumber of very large tubular flowers in the tropics, such as the huge\r\nbrugmansias and bignonias; while in the Andes and in Chile, where\r\nhumming-birds are especially plentiful, we find great numbers of red\r\ntubular flowers, often of large size and apparently adapted to these\r\nlittle creatures. Such are the beautiful Lapageria and Philesia, the\r\ngrand Pitcairneas, and the genera Fuchsia, Mitraria, Embothrium,\r\nEscallonia, Desfontainea, Eccremocarpus, and many Gesneraceae. Among the\r\nmost extraordinary modifications of flower structure adapted to bird\r\nfertilisation are the species of Marcgravia, in which the pedicels and\r\nbracts of the terminal portion of a pendent bunch of flowers have been\r\nmodified into pitchers which secrete nectar and attract insects, while\r\nbirds feeding on the nectar, or insects, have the pollen of the\r\noverhanging flowers dusted on their backs, and, carrying it to other\r\nflowers, thus cross-fertilise them (see Illustration).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Humming-bird fertilising Marcgravia\r\nnepenthoides.]\r\n\r\nIn Australia and New Zealand the fine \"glory peas\" (Clianthus), the\r\nSophora, Loranthus, many Epacrideae and Myrtaceae, and the large flowers\r\nof the New Zealand flax (Phormium tenax), are cross-fertilised by\r\nbirds; while in Natal the fine trumpet-creeper (Tecoma capensis) is\r\nfertilised by Nectarineas.\r\n\r\nThe great extent to which insect and bird agency is necessary to flowers\r\nis well shown by the case of New Zealand. The entire country is\r\ncomparatively poor in species of insects, especially in bees and\r\nbutterflies which are the chief flower fertilisers; yet according to the\r\nresearches of local botanists no less than one-fourth of all the\r\nflowering plants are incapable of self-fertilisation, and, therefore,\r\nwholly dependent on insect or bird agency for the continuance of the\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe facts as to the cross-fertilisation of flowers which have now been\r\nvery briefly summarised, taken in connection with Darwin's experiments\r\nproving the increased vigour and fertility given by cross-fertilisation,\r\nseem amply to justify his aphorism that \"Nature abhors\r\nself-fertilisation,\" and his more precise statement, that, \"No plant is\r\nperpetually self-fertilised;\" and this view has been upheld by\r\nHildebrand, Delpino, and other botanists.[150]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Self-Fertilisation of Flowers._\r\n\r\nBut all this time we have been only looking at one side of the question,\r\nfor there exists an abundance of facts which seem to imply, just as\r\nsurely, the utter uselessness of cross-fertilisation. Let us, then, see\r\nwhat these facts are before proceeding further.\r\n\r\n1. An immense variety of plants are habitually self-fertilised, and\r\ntheir numbers probably far exceed those which are habitually\r\ncross-fertilised by insects. Almost all the very small or obscure\r\nflowered plants with hermaphrodite flowers are of this kind. Most of\r\nthese, however, may be insect fertilised occasionally, and may,\r\ntherefore, come under the rule that no species are perpetually\r\nself-fertilised.\r\n\r\n2. There are many plants, however, in which special arrangements exist\r\nto secure self-fertilisation. Sometimes the corolla closes and brings\r\nthe anthers and stigma into contact; in others the anthers cluster round\r\nthe stigmas, both maturing together, as in many buttercups, stitchwort\r\n(Stellaria media), sandwort (Spergula), and some willow-herbs\r\n(Epilobium); or they arch over the pistil, as in Galium aparine and\r\nAlisma Plantago. The style is also modified to bring it into contact\r\nwith the anthers, as in the dandelion, groundsel, and many other\r\nplants.[151] All these, however, may be occasionally cross-fertilised.\r\n\r\n3. In other cases precautions are taken to prevent cross-fertilisation,\r\nas in the numerous cleistogamous or closed flowers. These occur in no\r\nless than fifty-five different genera, belonging to twenty-four natural\r\norders, and in thirty-two of these genera the normal flowers are\r\nirregular, and have therefore been specially modified for insect\r\nfertilisation.[152] These flowers appear to be degradations of the\r\nnormal flowers, and are closed up by various modifications of the petals\r\nor other parts, so that it is impossible for insects to reach the\r\ninterior, yet they produce seed in abundance, and are often the chief\r\nmeans by which the species is continued. Thus, in our common dog-violet\r\nthe perfect flowers rarely produce seed, while the rudimentary\r\ncleistogamic flowers do so in abundance. The sweet violet also produces\r\nabundance of seed from its cleistogamic flowers, and few from its\r\nperfect flowers; but in Liguria it produces only perfect flowers which\r\nseed abundantly. No case appears to be known of a plant which has\r\ncleistogamic flowers only, but a small rush (Juncus bufonius) is in this\r\ncondition in some parts of Russia, while in other parts perfect flowers\r\nare also produced.[153] Our common henbit dead-nettle (Lamium\r\namplexicaule) produces cleistogamic flowers, as do also some orchids.\r\nThe advantage gained by the plant is great economy of specialised\r\nmaterial, since with very small flowers and very little expenditure of\r\npollen an abundance of seed is produced.\r\n\r\n4. A considerable number of plants which have evidently been specially\r\nmodified for insect fertilisation have, by further modification, become\r\nquite self-fertile. This is the case with the garden-pea, and also with\r\nour beautiful bee-orchis, in which the pollen-masses constantly fall on\r\nto the stigmas, and the flower, being thus self-fertilised, produces\r\nabundance of capsules and of seed. Yet in many of its close allies\r\ninsect agency is absolutely required; but in one of these, the\r\nfly-orchis, comparatively very little seed is produced, and\r\nself-fertilisation would therefore be advantageous to it. When\r\ngarden-peas were artificially cross-fertilised by Mr. Darwin, it seemed\r\nto do them no good, as the seeds from these crosses produced less\r\nvigorous plants than seed from those which were self-fertilised; a fact\r\ndirectly opposed to what usually occurs in cross-fertilised plants.\r\n\r\n5. As opposed to the theory that there is any absolute need for\r\ncross-fertilisation, it has been urged by Mr. Henslow and others that\r\nmany self-fertilised plants are exceptionally vigorous, such as\r\ngroundsel, chickweed, sow-thistle, buttercups, and other common weeds;\r\nwhile most plants of world-wide distribution are self-fertilised, and\r\nthese have proved themselves to be best fitted to survive in the battle\r\nof life. More than fifty species of common British plants are very\r\nwidely distributed, and all are habitually self-fertilised.[154] That\r\nself-fertilisation has some great advantage is shown by the fact that it\r\nis usually the species which have the smallest and least conspicuous\r\nflowers which have spread widely, while the large and showy flowered\r\nspecies of the same genera or families, which require insects to\r\ncross-fertilise them, have a much more limited distribution.\r\n\r\n6. It is now believed by some botanists that many inconspicuous and\r\nimperfect flowers, including those that are wind-fertilised, such as\r\nplantains, nettles, sedges, and grasses, do not represent primitive or\r\nundeveloped forms, but are degradations from more perfect flowers which\r\nwere once adapted to insect fertilisation. In almost every order we find\r\nsome plants which have become thus reduced or degraded for wind or\r\nself-fertilisation, as Poterium and Sanguisorba among the Rosaceae;\r\nwhile this has certainly been the case in the cleistogamic flowers. In\r\nmost of the above-mentioned plants there are distinct rudiments of\r\npetals or other floral organs, and as the chief use of these is to\r\nattract insects, they could hardly have existed in primitive\r\nflowers.[155] We know, moreover, that when the petals cease to be\r\nrequired for the attraction of insects, they rapidly diminish in size,\r\nlose their bright colour or almost wholly disappear.[156]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Difficulties and Contradictions._\r\n\r\nThe very bare summary that has now been given of the main facts relating\r\nto the fertilisation of flowers, will have served to show the vast\r\nextent and complexity of the inquiry, and the extraordinary\r\ncontradictions and difficulties which it presents. We have direct proof\r\nof the beneficial results of intercrossing in a great number of cases;\r\nwe have an overwhelming mass of facts as to the varied and complex\r\nstructure of flowers evidently adapted to secure this intercrossing by\r\ninsect agency; yet we see many of the most vigorous plants which spread\r\nwidely over the globe, with none of these adaptations, and evidently\r\ndepending on self-fertilisation for their continued existence and\r\nsuccess in the battle of life. Yet more extraordinary is it to find\r\nnumerous cases in which the special arrangements for cross-fertilisation\r\nappear to have been a failure, since they have either been supplemented\r\nby special means for self-fertilisation, or have reverted back in\r\nvarious degrees to simpler forms in which self-fertilisation becomes the\r\nrule. There is also a further difficulty in the highly complex modes by\r\nwhich cross-fertilisation is often brought about; for we have seen that\r\nthere are several very effective yet very simple modes of securing\r\nintercrossing, involving a minimum of change in the form and structure\r\nof the flower; and when we consider that the result attained with so\r\nmuch cost of structural modification is by no means an unmixed good, and\r\nis far less certain in securing the perpetuation of the species than is\r\nself-fertilisation, it is most puzzling to find such complex methods\r\nresorted to, sometimes to the extent of special precautions against the\r\npossibility of self-fertilisation ever taking place. Let us now see\r\nwhether any light can be thrown on these various anomalies and\r\ncontradictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Intercrossing not necessarily Advantageous._\r\n\r\nNo one was more fully impressed than Mr. Darwin with the beneficial\r\neffects of intercrossing on the vigour and fertility of the species or\r\nrace, yet he clearly saw that it was not always and necessarily\r\nadvantageous. He says: \"The most important conclusion at which I have\r\narrived is, that the mere act of intercrossing by itself does no good.\r\nThe good depends on the individuals which are crossed differing slightly\r\nin constitution, owing to their progenitors having been subjected during\r\nseveral generations to slightly different conditions. This conclusion,\r\nas we shall hereafter see, is closely connected with various important\r\nphysiological problems, such as the benefit derived from slight changes\r\nin the conditions of life.\"[157] Mr. Darwin has also adduced much direct\r\nevidence proving that slight changes in the conditions of life are\r\nbeneficial to both animals and plants, maintaining or restoring their\r\nvigour and fertility in the same way as a favourable cross seems to\r\nrestore it.[158] It is, I believe, by a careful consideration of these\r\ntwo classes of facts that we shall find the clue to the labyrinth in\r\nwhich this subject has appeared to involve us.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Supposed Evil Results of Close Interbreeding._\r\n\r\nJust as we have seen that intercrossing is not necessarily good, we\r\nshall be forced to admit that close interbreeding is not necessarily\r\nbad. Our finest breeds of domestic animals have been thus produced, and\r\nby a careful statistical inquiry Mr. George Darwin has shown that the\r\nmost constant and long-continued intermarriages among the British\r\naristocracy have produced no prejudicial results. The rabbits on Porto\r\nSanto are all the produce of a single female; they have lived on the\r\nsame small island for 470 years, and they still abound there and appear\r\nto be vigorous and healthy (see p. 161).\r\n\r\nWe have, however, on the other hand, overwhelming evidence that in many\r\ncases, among our domestic animals and cultivated plants, close\r\ninterbreeding does produce bad results, and the apparent contradiction\r\nmay perhaps be explained on the same general principles, and under\r\nsimilar limitations, as were found to be necessary in defining the value\r\nof intercrossing. It appears probable, then, that it is not\r\ninterbreeding in itself that is hurtful, but interbreeding without\r\nrigid selection or some change of conditions. Under nature, as in the\r\ncase of the Porto Santo rabbits, the rapid increase of these animals\r\nwould in a very few years stock the island with a full population, and\r\nthereafter natural selection would act powerfully in the preservation\r\nonly of the healthiest and the most fertile, and under these conditions\r\nno deterioration would occur. Among the aristocracy there has been a\r\nconstant selection of beauty, which is generally synonymous with health,\r\nwhile any constitutional infertility has led to the extinction of the\r\nfamily. With domestic animals the selection practised is usually neither\r\nsevere enough nor of the right kind. There is no natural struggle for\r\nexistence, but certain points of form and colour characteristic of the\r\nbreed are considered essential, and thus the most vigorous or the most\r\nfertile are not always those which are selected to continue the stock.\r\nIn nature, too, the species always extends over a larger area and\r\nconsists of much greater numbers, and thus a difference of constitution\r\nsoon arises in different parts of the area, which is wanting in the\r\nlimited numbers of pure bred domestic animals. From a consideration of\r\nthese varied facts we conclude that an occasional disturbance of the\r\norganic equilibrium is what is essential to keep up the vigour and\r\nfertility of any organism, and that this disturbance may be equally well\r\nproduced either by a cross between individuals of somewhat different\r\nconstitutions, or by occasional slight changes in the conditions of\r\nlife. Now plants which have great powers of dispersal enjoy a constant\r\nchange of conditions, and can, therefore, exist permanently, or at all\r\nevents, for very long periods, without intercrossing; while those which\r\nhave limited powers of dispersal, and are restricted to a comparatively\r\nsmall and uniform area, need an occasional cross to keep up their\r\nfertility and general vigour. We should, therefore, expect that those\r\ngroups of plants which are adapted both for cross-and\r\nself-fertilisation, which have showy flowers and possess great powers of\r\nseed-dispersal, would be the most abundant and most widely distributed;\r\nand this we find to be the case, the Compositae possessing all these\r\ncharacteristics in the highest degree, and being the most generally\r\nabundant group of plants with conspicuous flowers in all parts of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n_How the Struggle for Existence Acts among Flowers._\r\n\r\nLet us now consider what will be the action of the struggle for\r\nexistence under the conditions we have seen to exist.\r\n\r\nEverywhere and at all times some species of plants will be dominant and\r\naggressive; while others will be diminishing in numbers, reduced to\r\noccupy a smaller area, and generally having a hard struggle to maintain\r\nthemselves. Whenever a self-fertilising plant is thus reduced in numbers\r\nit will be in danger of extinction, because, being limited to a small\r\narea, it will suffer from the effects of too uniform conditions which\r\nwill produce weakness and infertility. But while this change is in\r\nprogress, any crosses between individuals of slightly different\r\nconstitution will be beneficial, and all variations favouring either\r\ninsect agency on the one hand, or wind-dispersal of pollen on the other,\r\nwill lead to the production of a somewhat stronger and more fertile\r\nstock. Increased size or greater brilliancy of the flower, more abundant\r\nnectar, sweeter odour, or adaptations for more effectual\r\ncross-fertilisation would all be preserved, and thus would be initiated\r\nsome form of specialisation for insect agency in cross-fertilisation;\r\nand in every different species so circumstanced the result would be\r\ndifferent, depending as it would on many and complex combinations of\r\nvariation of parts of the flower, and of the insect species which most\r\nabounded in the district.\r\n\r\nSpecies thus favourably modified might begin a new era of development,\r\nand, while spreading over a somewhat wider area, give rise to new\r\nvarieties or species, all adapted in various degrees and modes to secure\r\ncross-fertilisation by insect agency. But in course of ages some change\r\nof conditions might prove adverse. Either the insects required might\r\ndiminish in numbers or be attracted by other competing flowers, or a\r\nchange of climate might give the advantage to other more vigorous\r\nplants. Then self-fertilisation with greater means of dispersal might be\r\nmore advantageous; the flowers might become smaller and more numerous;\r\nthe seeds smaller and lighter so as to be more easily dispersed by the\r\nwind, while some of the special adaptations for insect fertilisation\r\nbeing useless would, by the absence of selection and by the law of\r\neconomy of growth, be reduced to a rudimentary form. With these\r\nmodifications the species might extend its range into new districts,\r\nthereby obtaining increased vigour by the change of conditions, as\r\nappears to have been the case with so many of the small flowered\r\nself-fertilised plants. Thus it might continue to exist for a long\r\nseries of ages, till under other changes--geographical or biological--it\r\nmight again suffer from competition or from other adverse circumstances,\r\nand be at length again confined to a limited area, or reduced to very\r\nscanty numbers.\r\n\r\nBut when this cycle of change had taken place, the species would be very\r\ndifferent from the original form. The flower would have been at one time\r\nmodified to favour the visits of insects and to secure\r\ncross-fertilisation by their aid, and when the need for this passed\r\naway, some portions of these structures would remain, though in a\r\nreduced or rudimentary condition. But when insect agency became of\r\nimportance a second time, the new modifications would start from a\r\ndifferent or more advanced basis, and thus a more complex result might\r\nbe produced. Owing to the unequal rates at which the reduction of the\r\nvarious parts might occur, some amount of irregularity in the flower\r\nmight arise, and on a second development towards insect\r\ncross-fertilisation this irregularity, if useful, might be increased by\r\nvariation and selection.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity and comparative certainty with which such changes as are\r\nhere supposed do really take place, are well shown by the great\r\ndifferences in floral structure, as regards the mode of fertilisation,\r\nin allied genera and species, and even in some cases in varieties of the\r\nsame species. Thus in the Ranunculaceae we find the conspicuous part of\r\nthe flower to be the petals in Ranunculus, the sepals in Helleborus,\r\nAnemone, etc., and the stamens in most species of Thalictrum. In all\r\nthese we have a simple regular flower, but in Aquilegia it is made\r\ncomplex by the spurred petals, and in Delphinium and Aconitum it becomes\r\nquite irregular. In the more simple class self-fertilisation occurs\r\nfreely, but it is prevented in the more complex flowers by the stamens\r\nmaturing before the pistil. In the Caprifoliaceae we have small and\r\nregular greenish flowers, as in the moschatel (Adoxa); more conspicuous\r\nregular open flowers without honey, as in the elder (Sambucus); and\r\ntubular flowers increasing in length and irregularity, till in some,\r\nlike our common honeysuckle, they are adapted for fertilisation by moths\r\nonly, with abundant honey and delicious perfume to attract them. In the\r\nScrophulariaceae we find open, almost regular flowers, as Veronica and\r\nVerbascum, fertilised by flies and bees, but also self-fertilised;\r\nScrophularia adapted in form and colour to be fertilised by wasps; and\r\nthe more complex and irregular flowers of Linaria, Rhinanthus,\r\nMelampyrum, Pedicularis, etc., mostly adapted to be fertilised by bees.\r\n\r\nIn the genera Geranium, Polygonum, Veronica, and several others there is\r\na gradation of forms from large and bright to small and obscure coloured\r\nflowers, and in every case the former are adapted for insect\r\nfertilisation, often exclusively, while in the latter self-fertilisation\r\nconstantly occurs. In the yellow rattle (Rhinanthus Crista-galli) there\r\nare two forms (which have been named _major_ and _minor_), the larger\r\nand more conspicuous adapted to insect fertilisation only, the smaller\r\ncapable of self-fertilisation; and two similar forms exist in the\r\neyebright (Euphrasia officinalis). In both these cases there are special\r\nmodifications in the length and curvature of the style as well as in the\r\nsize and shape of the corolla; and the two forms are evidently becoming\r\neach adapted to special conditions, since in some districts the one, in\r\nother districts the other is most abundant.[159]\r\n\r\nThese examples show us that the kind of change suggested above is\r\nactually going on, and has presumably always been going on in nature\r\nthroughout the long geological epochs during which the development of\r\nflowers has been progressing. The two great modes of gaining increased\r\nvigour and fertility--intercrossing and dispersal over wider areas--have\r\nbeen resorted to again and again, under the pressure of a constant\r\nstruggle for existence and the need for adaptation to ever-changing\r\nconditions. During all the modifications that ensued, useless parts were\r\nreduced or suppressed, owing to the absence of selection and the\r\nprinciple of economy of growth; and thus at each fresh adaptation some\r\nrudiments of old structures were re-developed, but not unfrequently in\r\na different form and for a distinct purpose.\r\n\r\nThe chief types of flowering plants have existed during the millions of\r\nages of the whole tertiary period, and during this enormous lapse of\r\ntime many of them may have been modified in the direction of insect\r\nfertilisation, and again into that of self-fertilisation, not once or\r\ntwice only, but perhaps scores or even hundreds of times; and at each\r\nsuch modification a difference in the environment may have led to a\r\ndistinct line of development. At one epoch the highest specialisation of\r\nstructure in adaptation to a single species or group of insects may have\r\nsaved a plant from extinction; while, at other times, the simplest mode\r\nof self-fertilisation, combined with greater powers of dispersal and a\r\nconstitution capable of supporting diverse physical conditions, may have\r\nled to a similar result. With some groups the tendency seems to have\r\nbeen almost continuously to greater and greater specialisation, while\r\nwith others a tendency to simplification and degradation has resulted in\r\nsuch plants as the grasses and sedges.\r\n\r\nWe are now enabled dimly to perceive how the curious anomaly of very\r\nsimple and very complex methods of securing cross-fertilisation--both\r\nequally effective--may have been brought about. The simple modes may be\r\nthe result of a comparatively direct modification from the more\r\nprimitive types of flowers, which were occasionally, and, as it were,\r\naccidentally visited and fertilised by insects; while the more complex\r\nmodes, existing for the most part in the highly irregular flowers, may\r\nresult from those cases in which adaptation to insect-fertilisation, and\r\npartial or complete degradation to self-fertilisation or to\r\nwind-fertilisation, have again and again recurred, each time producing\r\nsome additional complexity, arising from the working up of old rudiments\r\nfor new purposes, till there have been reached the marvellous flower\r\nstructures of the papilionaceous tribes, of the asclepiads, or of the\r\norchids.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that the existing diversity of colour and of structure in\r\nflowers is probably the ultimate result of the ever-recurring struggle\r\nfor existence, combined with the ever-changing relations between the\r\nvegetable and animal kingdoms during countless ages. The constant\r\nvariability of every part and organ, with the enormous powers of\r\nincrease possessed by plants, have enabled them to become again and\r\nagain readjusted to each change of condition as it occurred, resulting\r\nin that endless variety, that marvellous complexity, and that exquisite\r\ncolouring which excite our admiration in the realm of flowers, and\r\nconstitute them the perennial charm and crowning glory of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Flowers the Product of Insect Agency._\r\n\r\nIn his _Origin of Species_, Mr. Darwin first stated that flowers had\r\nbeen rendered conspicuous and beautiful in order to attract insects,\r\nadding: \"Hence we may conclude that, if insects had not been developed\r\non the earth, our plants would not have been decked with beautiful\r\nflowers, but would have produced only such poor flowers as we see on our\r\nfir, oak, nut, and ash trees, on grasses, docks, and nettles, which are\r\nall fertilised through the agency of the wind.\" The argument in favour\r\nof this view is now much stronger than when he wrote; for not only have\r\nwe reason to believe that most of these wind-fertilised flowers are\r\ndegraded forms of flowers which have once been insect fertilised, but we\r\nhave abundant evidence that whenever insect agency becomes comparatively\r\nineffective, the colours of the flowers become less bright, their size\r\nand beauty diminish, till they are reduced to such small, greenish,\r\ninconspicuous flowers as those of the rupture-wort (Herniaria glabra),\r\nthe knotgrass (Polygonum aviculare), or the cleistogamic flowers of the\r\nviolet. There is good reason to believe, therefore, not only that\r\nflowers have been developed in order to attract insects to aid in their\r\nfertilisation, but that, having been once produced, in however great\r\nprofusion, if the insect races were all to become extinct, flowers (in\r\nthe temperate zones at all events) would soon dwindle away, and that\r\nultimately all floral beauty would vanish from the earth.\r\n\r\nWe cannot, therefore, deny the vast change which insects have produced\r\nupon the earth's surface, and which has been thus forcibly and\r\nbeautifully delineated by Mr. Grant Allen: \"While man has only tilled a\r\nfew level plains, a few great river valleys, a few peninsular mountain\r\nslopes, leaving the vast mass of earth untouched by his hand, the insect\r\nhas spread himself over every land in a thousand shapes, and has made\r\nthe whole flowering creation subservient to his daily wants. His\r\nbuttercup, his dandelion, and his meadow-sweet grow thick in every\r\nEnglish field. His thyme clothes the hillside; his heather purples the\r\nbleak gray moorland. High up among the alpine heights his gentian\r\nspreads its lakes of blue; amid the snows of the Himalayas his\r\nrhododendrons gleam with crimson light. Even the wayside pond yields him\r\nthe white crowfoot and the arrowhead, while the broad expanses of\r\nBrazilian streams are beautified by his gorgeous water-lilies. The\r\ninsect has thus turned the whole surface of the earth into a boundless\r\nflower-garden, which supplies him from year to year with pollen or\r\nhoney, and itself in turn gains perpetuation by the baits that it offers\r\nfor his allurement.\"[160]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Concluding Remarks on Colour in Nature._\r\n\r\nIn the last four chapters I have endeavoured to give a general and\r\nsystematic, though necessarily condensed view of the part which is\r\nplayed by colour in the organic world. We have seen in what infinitely\r\nvaried ways the need of concealment has led to the modification of\r\nanimal colours, whether among polar snows or sandy deserts, in tropical\r\nforests or in the abysses of the ocean. We next find these general\r\nadaptations giving way to more specialised types of coloration, by which\r\neach species has become more and more harmonised with its immediate\r\nsurroundings, till we reach the most curiously minute resemblances to\r\nnatural objects in the leaf and stick insects, and those which are so\r\nlike flowers or moss or birds' droppings that they deceive the acutest\r\neye. We have learnt, further, that these varied forms of protective\r\ncolouring are far more numerous than has been usually suspected,\r\nbecause, what appear to be very conspicuous colours or markings when the\r\nspecies is observed in a museum or in a menagerie, are often highly\r\nprotective when the creature is seen under the natural conditions of its\r\nexistence. From these varied classes of facts it seems not improbable\r\nthat fully one-half of the species in the animal kingdom possess colours\r\nwhich have been more or less adapted to secure for them concealment or\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nPassing onward we find the explanation of a distinct type of colour or\r\nmarking, often superimposed upon protective tints, in the importance of\r\neasy recognition by many animals of their fellows, their parents, or\r\ntheir mates. By this need we have been able to account for markings that\r\nseem calculated to make the animal conspicuous, when the general tints\r\nand well-known habits of the whole group demonstrate the need of\r\nconcealment. Thus also we are able to explain the constant symmetry in\r\nthe markings of wild animals, as well as the numerous cases in which the\r\nconspicuous colours are concealed when at rest and only become visible\r\nduring rapid motion. In striking contrast to ordinary protective\r\ncoloration we have \"warning colours,\" usually very conspicuous and often\r\nbrilliant or gaudy, which serve to indicate that their possessors are\r\neither dangerous or uneatable to the usual enemies of their tribe. This\r\nkind of coloration is probably more prevalent than has been hitherto\r\nsupposed, because in the case of many tropical animals we are quite\r\nunacquainted with their special and most dangerous enemies, and are also\r\nunable to determine whether they are or are not distasteful to those\r\nenemies. As a kind of corollary to the \"warning colours,\" we find the\r\nextraordinary phenomena of \"mimicry,\" in which defenceless species\r\nobtain protection by being mistaken for those which, from any cause,\r\npossess immunity from attack. Although a large number of instances of\r\nwarning colour and of mimicry are now recorded, it is probably still an\r\nalmost unworked field of research, more especially in tropical regions\r\nand among the inhabitants of the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of sexual diversities of coloration next engaged our\r\nattention, and the reasons why Mr. Darwin's theory of \"sexual\r\nselection,\" as regards colour and ornament, could not be accepted were\r\nstated at some length, together with the theory of animal coloration and\r\nornament we propose to substitute for it. This theory is held to be in\r\nharmony with the general facts of animal coloration, while it entirely\r\ndispenses with the very hypothetical and inadequate agency of female\r\nchoice in producing the detailed colours, patterns, and ornaments, which\r\nin so many cases distinguish the male sex.\r\n\r\nIf my arguments on this point are sound, they will dispose also of Mr.\r\nGrant Allen's view of the direct action of the colour sense on the\r\nanimal integuments.[161] He argues that the colours of insects and birds\r\nreproduce generally the colours of the flowers they frequent or the\r\nfruits they eat, and he adduces numerous cases in which flower-haunting\r\ninsects and fruit-eating birds are gaily coloured. This he supposes to\r\nbe due to the colour-taste, developed by the constant presence of bright\r\nflowers and fruits, being applied to the selection of each variation\r\ntowards brilliancy in their mates; thus in time producing the gorgeous\r\nand varied hues they now possess. Mr. Allen maintains that \"insects are\r\nbright where bright flowers exist in numbers, and dull where flowers are\r\nrare or inconspicuous;\" and he urges that \"we can hardly explain this\r\nwide coincidence otherwise than by supposing that a taste for colour is\r\nproduced through the constant search for food among entomophilous\r\nblossoms, and that this taste has reacted upon its possessors through\r\nthe action of unconscious sexual selection.\"\r\n\r\nThe examples Mr. Allen quotes of bright insects being associated with\r\nbright flowers seem very forcible, but are really deceptive or\r\nerroneous; and quite as many cases could be quoted which prove the very\r\nopposite. For example, in the dense equatorial forests flowers are\r\nexceedingly scarce, and there is no comparison with the amount of floral\r\ncolour to be met with in our temperate meadows, woods, and hillsides.\r\nThe forests about Para in the lower Amazon are typical in this respect,\r\nyet they abound with the most gorgeously coloured butterflies, almost\r\nall of which frequent the forest depths, keeping near the ground, where\r\nthere is the greatest deficiency of brilliant flowers. In contrast with\r\nthis let us take the Cape of Good Hope--the most flowery region probably\r\nthat exists upon the globe,--where the country is a complete\r\nflower-garden of heaths, pelargoniums, mesembryanthemus, exquisite\r\niridaceous and other bulbs, and numerous flowering shrubs and trees; yet\r\nthe Cape butterflies are hardly equal, either in number or variety, to\r\nthose of any country in South Europe, and are utterly insignificant when\r\ncompared with those of the comparatively flowerless forest-depths of the\r\nAmazon or of New Guinea. Neither is there any relation between the\r\ncolours of other insects and their haunts. Few are more gorgeous than\r\nsome of the tiger-beetles and the carabi, yet these are all carnivorous;\r\nwhile many of the most brilliant metallic buprestidae and longicorns are\r\nalways found on the bark of fallen trees. So with the humming-birds;\r\ntheir brilliant metallic tints can only be compared with metals or gems,\r\nand are totally unlike the delicate pinks and purples, yellows and reds\r\nof the majority of flowers. Again, the Australian honey-suckers\r\n(Meliphagidae) are genuine flower-haunters, and the Australian flora is\r\nmore brilliant in colour display than that of most tropical regions, yet\r\nthese birds are, as a rule, of dull colours, not superior on the average\r\nto our grain-eating finches. Then, again, we have the grand pheasant\r\nfamily, including the gold and the silver pheasants, the gorgeous\r\nfire-backed and ocellated pheasants, and the resplendent peacock, all\r\nfeeding on the ground on grain or seeds or insects, yet adorned with the\r\nmost gorgeous colours.\r\n\r\nThere is, therefore, no adequate basis of facts for this theory to rest\r\nupon, even if there were the slightest reason to believe that not only\r\nbirds, but butterflies and beetles, take any delight in colour for its\r\nown sake, apart from the food-supply of which it indicates the presence.\r\nAll that has been proved or that appears to be probable is, that they\r\nare able to perceive differences of colour, and to associate each colour\r\nwith the particular flowers or fruits which best satisfy their wants.\r\nColour being in its nature diverse, it has been beneficial for them to\r\nbe able to distinguish all its chief varieties, as manifested more\r\nparticularly in the vegetable kingdom, and among the different species\r\nof their own group; and the fact that certain species of insects show\r\nsome preference for a particular colour may be explained by their having\r\nfound flowers of that colour to yield them a more abundant supply of\r\nnectar or of pollen. In those cases in which butterflies frequent\r\nflowers of their own colour, the habit may well have been acquired from\r\nthe protection it affords them.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that, in imputing to insects and birds the same love of\r\ncolour for its own sake and the same aesthetic tastes as we ourselves\r\npossess, we may be as far from the truth as were those writers who held\r\nthat the bee was a good mathematician, and that the honeycomb was\r\nconstructed throughout to satisfy its refined mathematical instincts;\r\nwhereas it is now generally admitted to be the result of the simple\r\nprinciple of economy of material applied to a primitive cylindrical\r\ncell.[162]\r\n\r\nIn studying the phenomena of colour in the organic world we have been\r\nled to realise the wonderful complexity of the adaptations which bring\r\neach species into harmonious relation with all those which surround it,\r\nand which thus link together the whole of nature in a network of\r\nrelations of marvellous intricacy. Yet all this is but, as it were, the\r\noutward show and garment of nature, behind which lies the inner\r\nstructure--the framework, the vessels, the cells, the circulating\r\nfluids, and the digestive and reproductive processes,--and behind these\r\nagain those mysterious chemical, electrical, and vital forces which\r\nconstitute what we term Life. These forces appear to be fundamentally\r\nthe same for all organisms, as is the material of which all are\r\nconstructed; and we thus find behind the outer diversities an inner\r\nrelationship which binds together the myriad forms of life.\r\n\r\nEach species of animal or plant thus forms part of one harmonious whole,\r\ncarrying in all the details of its complex structure the record of the\r\nlong story of organic development; and it was with a truly inspired\r\ninsight that our great philosophical poet apostrophised the humble\r\nweed--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Flower in the crannied wall,\r\n    I pluck you out of the crannies,\r\n    I hold you here, root and all, in my hand,\r\n    Little flower--but _if_ I could understand\r\n    What you are, root and all, and all in all,\r\n    I should know what God and man is.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 136: Burchell's _Travels_, vol. i. p. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 137: _Nature_, vol. iii. p. 507.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 138: _Flowers, Fruits, and Leaves_, p. 128 (Fig. 79).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 139: For a popular sketch of these, see Sir J.

Linn. Soc._\r\nSecond series, _Botany_, vol. i. p. 391.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 155: The Rev. George Henslow, in his _Origin of Floral\r\nStructures_, says: \"There is little doubt but that all wind-fertilised\r\nangiosperms are degradations from insect-fertilised flowers....\r\n_Poterium sanguisorba_ is anemophilous; and _Sanguisorba officinalis_\r\npresumably was so formerly, but has reacquired an entomophilous habit;\r\nthe whole tribe Poterieae being, in fact, a degraded group which has\r\ndescended from Potentilleae. Plantains retain their corolla but in a\r\ndegraded form. Junceae are degraded Lilies; while Cyperaceae and\r\nGramineae among monocotyledons may be ranked with Amentiferae among\r\ndicotyledons, as representing orders which have retrograded very far\r\nfrom the entomophilous forms from which they were possibly and probably\r\ndescended\" (p. 266).\r\n\r\n\"The genus Plantago, like _Thalictrum minus_, Poterium, and others, well\r\nillustrate the change from an entomophilous to the anemophilous state.\r\n_P. lanceolata_ has polymorphic flowers, and is visited by\r\npollen-seeking insects, so that it can be fertilised either by insects\r\nor the wind. _P. media_ illustrates transitions in point of structure,\r\nas the filaments are pink, the anthers motionless, and the pollen grains\r\naggregated, and it is regularly visited by _Bombus terrestris_. On the\r\nother hand, the slender filaments, versatile anthers, powdery pollen,\r\nand elongated protogynous style are features of other species indicating\r\nanemophily; while the presence of a degraded corolla shows its ancestors\r\nto have been entomophilous. _P. media_, therefore, illustrates, not a\r\nprimitive entomophilous condition, but a return to it; just as is the\r\ncase with _Sanguisorba officinalis_ and _Salix Caprea_; but these show\r\nno capacity of restoring the corolla, the attractive features having to\r\nbe borne by the calyx, which is purplish in Sanguisorba, by the pink\r\nfilaments of Plantago, and by the yellow anthers in the Sallow willow\"\r\n(p. 271).\r\n\r\n\"The interpretation, then, I would offer of inconspicuousness and all\r\nkinds of degradations is the exact opposite to that of conspicuousness\r\nand great differentiations; namely, that species with minute flowers,\r\nrarely or never visited by insects, and habitually self-fertilised, have\r\nprimarily arisen through the neglect of insects, and have in consequence\r\nassumed their present floral structures\" (p. 282).\r\n\r\nIn a letter just received from Mr. Henslow, he gives a few additional\r\nillustrations of his views, of which the following are the most\r\nimportant: \"Passing to Incompletae, the orders known collectively as\r\n'Cyclospermeae' are related to Caryophylleae; and to my mind are\r\ndegradations from it, of which Orache is anemophilous. Cupuliferae have\r\nan inferior ovary and rudimentary calyx-limb on the top. These, as far\r\nas I know, cannot be interpreted except as degradations. The whole of\r\nMonocotyledons appear to me (from anatomical reasons especially) to be\r\ndegradations from Dicotyledons, and primarily through the agency of\r\ngrowth in water. Many subsequently became terrestrial, but retained the\r\neffects of their primitive habitat through heredity. The 3-merous [sic]\r\nperianth of grasses, the parts of the flower being in whorls, point to a\r\ndegradation from a sub-liliaceous condition.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Henslow informs me that he has long held these views, but, as far as\r\nhe knows, alone. Mr. Grant Allen, however, set forth a similar theory in\r\nhis _Vignettes from Nature_ (p. 15) and more fully in _The Colours of\r\nFlowers_ (chap. v.), where he develops it fully and uses similar\r\narguments to those of Mr. Henslow.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 156: H.

He would\r\nalso anticipate that diversities of climate would always be associated\r\nwith a corresponding diversity in the forms of life.\r\n\r\nNow these anticipations are to a considerable extent justified.\r\nRemoteness on the earth's surface is usually an indication of diversity\r\nin the fauna and flora, while strongly contrasted climates are always\r\naccompanied by a considerable contrast in the forms of life. But this\r\ncorrespondence is by no means exact or proportionate, and the converse\r\npropositions are often quite untrue. Countries which are near to each\r\nother often differ radically in their animal and vegetable productions;\r\nwhile similarity of climate, together with moderate geographical\r\nproximity, are often accompanied by marked diversities in the prevailing\r\nforms of life. Again, while many groups of animals--genera, families,\r\nand sometimes even orders--are confined to limited regions, most of the\r\nfamilies, many genera, and even some species are found in every part of\r\nthe earth. An enumeration of a few of these anomalies will better\r\nillustrate the nature of the problem we have to solve.\r\n\r\nAs examples of extreme diversity, notwithstanding geographical\r\nproximity, we may adduce Madagascar and Africa, whose animal and\r\nvegetable productions are far less alike than are those of Great Britain\r\nand Japan at the remotest extremities of the great northern continent;\r\nwhile an equal, or perhaps even a still greater, diversity exists\r\nbetween Australia and New Zealand. On the other hand, Northern Africa\r\nand South Europe, though separated by the Mediterranean Sea, have faunas\r\nand floras which do not differ from each other more than do the various\r\ncountries of Europe. As a proof that similarity of climate and general\r\nadaptability have had but a small part in determining the forms of life\r\nin each country, we have the fact of the enormous increase of rabbits\r\nand pigs in Australia and New Zealand, of horses and cattle in South\r\nAmerica, and of the common sparrow in North America, though in none of\r\nthese cases are the animals natives of the countries in which they\r\nthrive so well. And lastly, in illustration of the fact that allied\r\nforms are not always found in adjacent regions, we have the tapirs,\r\nwhich are found only on opposite sides of the globe, in tropical America\r\nand the Malayan Islands; the camels of the Asiatic deserts, whose\r\nnearest allies are the llamas and alpacas of the Andes; and the\r\nmarsupials, only found in Australia and on the opposite side of the\r\nglobe, in America. Yet, again, although mammalia may be said to be\r\nuniversally distributed over the globe, being found abundantly on all\r\nthe continents and on a great many of the larger islands, yet they are\r\nentirely wanting in New Zealand, and in a considerable number of other\r\nislands which are, nevertheless, perfectly able to support them when\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\nNow most of these difficulties can be solved by means of well-known\r\ngeographical and geological facts. When the productions of remote\r\ncountries resemble each other, there is almost always continuity of land\r\nwith similarity of climate between them. When adjacent countries differ\r\ngreatly in their productions, we find them separated by a sea or strait\r\nwhose great depth is an indication of its antiquity or permanence. When\r\na group of animals inhabits two countries or regions separated by wide\r\noceans, it is found that in past geological times the same group was\r\nmuch more widely distributed, and may have reached the countries it\r\ninhabits from an intermediate region in which it is now extinct. We\r\nknow, also, that countries now united by land were divided by arms of\r\nthe sea at a not very remote epoch; while there is good reason to\r\nbelieve that others now entirely isolated by a broad expanse of sea were\r\nformerly united and formed a single land area. There is also another\r\nimportant factor to be taken account of in considering how animals and\r\nplants have acquired their present peculiarities of\r\ndistribution,--changes of climate. We know that quite recently a glacial\r\nepoch extended over much of what are now the temperate regions of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, and that consequently the organisms which inhabit\r\nthose parts must be, comparatively speaking, recent immigrants from more\r\nsouthern lands. But it is a yet more important fact that, down to middle\r\nTertiary times at all events, an equable temperate climate, with a\r\nluxuriant vegetation, extended to far within the arctic circle, over\r\nwhat are now barren wastes, covered for ten months of the year with snow\r\nand ice. The arctic zone has, therefore, been in past times capable of\r\nsupporting almost all the forms of life of our temperate regions; and we\r\nmust take account of this condition of things whenever we have to\r\nspeculate on the possible migrations of organisms between the old and\r\nnew continents.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Conditions which have determined Distribution._\r\n\r\nWhen we endeavour to explain in detail the facts of the existing\r\ndistribution of organic beings, we are confronted by several preliminary\r\nquestions, upon the solution of which will depend our treatment of the\r\nphenomena presented to us. Upon the theory of descent which we have\r\nadopted, all the different species of a genus, as well as all the genera\r\nwhich compose a family or higher group, have descended from some common\r\nancestor, and must therefore, at some remote epoch, have occupied the\r\nsame area, from which their descendants have spread to the regions they\r\nnow inhabit. In the numerous cases in which the same group now occupies\r\ncountries separated by oceans or seas, by lofty mountain-chains, by wide\r\ndeserts, or by inhospitable climates, we have to consider how the\r\nmigration which must certainly have taken place has been effected. It is\r\npossible that during some portion of the time which has elapsed since\r\nthe origin of the group the interposing barriers have not been in\r\nexistence; or, on the other hand, the particular organisms we are\r\ndealing with may have the power of overpassing the barriers, and thus\r\nreaching their present remote dwelling-places. As this is really the\r\nfundamental question of distribution on which the solution of all its\r\nmore difficult problems depends, we have to inquire, in the first place,\r\nwhat is the nature of, and what are the limits to, the changes of the\r\nearth's surface, especially during the Tertiary and latter part of the\r\nSecondary periods, as it was during those periods that most of the\r\nexisting types of the higher animals and plants came into existence;\r\nand, in the next place, what are the extreme limits of the powers of\r\ndispersal possessed by the chief groups of animals and plants. We will\r\nfirst consider the question of barriers, more especially those formed by\r\nseas and oceans.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Permanence of Oceans._\r\n\r\nIt was formerly a very general belief, even amongst geologists, that the\r\ngreat features of the earth's surface, no less than the smaller ones,\r\nwere subject to continual mutations, and that during the course of\r\nknown geological time the continents and great oceans had again and\r\nagain changed places with each other. Sir Charles Lyell, in the last\r\nedition of his _Principles of Geology_ (1872), said: \"Continents,\r\ntherefore, although permanent for whole geological epochs, shift their\r\npositions entirely in the course of ages;\" and this may be said to have\r\nbeen the orthodox opinion down to the very recent period when, by means\r\nof deep-sea soundings, the nature of the ocean bottom was made known.\r\nThe first person to throw doubt on this view appears to have been the\r\nveteran American geologist, Professor Dana. In 1849, in the Report of\r\nWilke's Exploring Expedition, he adduced the argument against a former\r\ncontinent in the Pacific during the Tertiary period, from the absence of\r\nall native quadrupeds. In 1856, in articles in the _American Journal_,\r\nhe discussed the development of the American continent, and argued for\r\nits general permanence; and in his _Manual of Geology_ in 1863 and later\r\neditions, the same views were more fully enforced and were latterly\r\napplied to all continents. Darwin, in his _Journal of Researches_,\r\npublished in 1845, called attention to the fact that all the small\r\nislands far from land in the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans are\r\neither of coralline or volcanic formation. He excepted, however, the\r\nSeychelles and St. Paul's rocks; but the former have since been shown to\r\nbe no exception, as they consist entirely of coral rock; and although\r\nDarwin himself spent a few hours on St. Paul's rocks on his outward\r\nvoyage in the _Beagle_, and believed he had found some portions of them\r\nto be of a \"cherty,\" and others of a \"felspathic\" nature, this also has\r\nbeen shown to be erroneous, and the careful examination of the rocks by\r\nthe Abbé Renard clearly proves them to be wholly of volcanic\r\norigin.[163] We have, therefore, at the present time, absolutely no\r\nexception whatever to the remarkable fact that all the oceanic islands\r\nof the globe are either of volcanic or coral formation; and there is,\r\nfurther, good reason to believe that those of the latter class in every\r\ncase rest upon a volcanic foundation.\r\n\r\nIn his _Origin of Species_, Darwin further showed that no true oceanic\r\nisland had any native mammals or batrachia when first discovered, this\r\nfact constituting the test of the class to which an island belongs;\r\nwhence he argued that none of them had ever been connected with\r\ncontinents, but all had originated in mid-ocean. These considerations\r\nalone render it almost certain that the areas now occupied by the great\r\noceans have never, during known geological time, been occupied by\r\ncontinents, since it is in the highest degree improbable that every\r\nfragment of those continents should have completely disappeared, and\r\nhave been replaced by volcanic islands rising out of profound oceanic\r\nabysses; but recent research into the depth of the oceans and the nature\r\nof the deposits now forming on their floors, adds greatly to the\r\nevidence in this direction, and renders it almost a certainty that they\r\nrepresent very ancient if not primaeval features of the earth's surface.\r\nA very brief outline of the nature of this evidence will be now given.\r\n\r\nThe researches of the _Challenger_ expedition into the nature of the\r\nsea-bottom show, that the whole of the land debris brought down by\r\nrivers to the ocean (with the exception of pumice and other floating\r\nmatter), is deposited comparatively near to the shores, and that the\r\nfineness of the material is an indication of the distance to which it\r\nhas been carried. Everything in the nature of gravel and sand is laid\r\ndown within a very few miles of land, only the finer muddy sediments\r\nbeing carried out for 20 or 50 miles, and the very finest of all, under\r\nthe most favourable conditions, rarely extending beyond 150, or at the\r\nutmost, 300 miles from land into the deep ocean.[164] Beyond these\r\ndistances, and covering the entire ocean floor, are various oozes formed\r\nwholly from the debris of marine organisms; while intermingled with\r\nthese are found various volcanic products which have been either carried\r\nthrough the air or floated on the surface, and a small but perfectly\r\nrecognisable quantity of meteoric matter. Ice-borne rocks are also found\r\nabundantly scattered over the ocean bottom within a definite distance of\r\nthe arctic and antarctic circles, clearly marking out the limit of\r\nfloating icebergs in recent geological times.\r\n\r\nNow the whole series of marine stratified rocks, from the earliest\r\nPalaeozoic to the most recent Tertiary beds, consist of materials\r\nclosely corresponding to the land debris now being deposited within a\r\nnarrow belt round the shores of all continents; while no rocks have been\r\nfound which can be identified with the various oozes now forming in the\r\ndeep abysses of the ocean. It follows, therefore, that all the\r\ngeological formations have been formed in comparatively shallow water,\r\nand always adjacent to the continental land of the period. The great\r\nthickness of some of the formations is no indication of a deep sea, but\r\nonly of slow subsidence during the time that the deposition was in\r\nprogress. This view is now adopted by many of the most experienced\r\ngeologists, especially by Dr. Archibald Geikie, Director of the\r\nGeological Survey of Great Britain, who, in his lecture on \"Geographical\r\nEvolution,\" says: \"From all this evidence we may legitimately conclude\r\nthat the present land of the globe, though consisting in great measure\r\nof marine formations, has never lain under the deep sea; but that its\r\nsite must always have been near land. Even its thick marine limestones\r\nare the deposits of comparatively shallow water.\"[165]\r\n\r\nBut besides these geological and physical considerations, there is a\r\nmechanical difficulty in the way of repeated change of position of\r\noceans and continents which has not yet received the attention it\r\ndeserves. According to the recent careful estimate by Mr. John Murray,\r\nthe land area of the globe is to the water area as ·28 to ·72. The mean\r\nheight of the land above sea-level is 2250 feet, while the mean depth of\r\nthe ocean is 14,640 feet. Hence the bulk of dry land is 23,450,000 cubic\r\nmiles, and that of the waters of the ocean 323,800,000 cubic miles; and\r\nit follows that if the whole of the solid matter of the earth's surface\r\nwere reduced to one level, it would be everywhere covered by an ocean\r\nabout two miles deep. The accompanying diagram will serve to render\r\nthese figures more intelligible. The length of the sections of land and\r\nocean are in the proportion of their respective areas, while the mean\r\nheight of the land and the mean depth of the ocean are exhibited on a\r\ngreatly increased vertical scale. If we considered the continents and\r\ntheir adjacent oceans separately they would differ a little, but not\r\nvery materially, from this diagram; in some cases the proportion of land\r\nto ocean would be a little greater, in others a little less.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.]\r\n\r\nNow, if we try to imagine a process of elevation and depression by which\r\nthe sea and land shall completely change places, we shall be met by\r\ninsuperable difficulties. We must, in the first place, assume a general\r\nequality between elevation and subsidence during any given period,\r\nbecause if the elevation over any extensive continental area were not\r\nbalanced by some subsidence of approximately equal amount, an\r\nunsupported hollow would be left under the earth's crust. Let us now\r\nsuppose a continental area to sink, and an adjacent oceanic area to\r\nrise, it will be seen that the greater part of the land will disappear\r\nlong before the new land has approached the surface of the ocean. This\r\ndifficulty will not be removed by supposing a portion of a continent to\r\nsubside, and the immediately adjacent portion of the ocean on the other\r\nside of the continent to rise, because in almost every case we find that\r\nwithin a comparatively short distance from the shores of all existing\r\ncontinents, the ocean floor sinks rapidly to a depth of from 2000 to\r\n3000 fathoms, and maintains a similar depth, generally speaking, over a\r\nlarge portion of the oceanic areas. In order, therefore, that any area\r\nof continental extent be upraised from the great oceans, there must be a\r\nsubsidence of a land area five or six times as great, unless it can be\r\nshown that an extensive elevation of the ocean floor up to and far\r\nabove the surface could occur without an equivalent depression\r\nelsewhere. The fact that the waters of the ocean are sufficient to cover\r\nthe whole globe to a depth of two miles, is alone sufficient to indicate\r\nthat the great ocean basins are permanent features of the earth's\r\nsurface, since any process of alternation of these with the land areas\r\nwould have been almost certain to result again and again in the total\r\ndisappearance of large portions, if not of all, of the dry land of the\r\nglobe. But the continuity of terrestrial life since the Devonian and\r\nCarboniferous periods, and the existence of very similar forms in the\r\ncorresponding deposits of every continent--as well as the occurrence of\r\nsedimentary rocks, indicating the proximity of land at the time of their\r\ndeposit, over a large portion of the surface of all the continents, and\r\nin every geological period--assure us that no such disappearance has\r\never occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Oceanic and Continental Areas._\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of the permanence of oceanic and continental areas as one\r\nof the established facts of modern research, we do not mean that\r\nexisting continents and oceans have always maintained the exact areas\r\nand outlines that they now present, but merely, that while all of them\r\nhave been undergoing changes in outline and extent from age to age, they\r\nhave yet maintained substantially the same positions, and have never\r\nactually changed places with each other. There are, moreover, certain\r\nphysical and biological facts which enable us to mark out these areas\r\nwith some confidence.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that there are a large number of islands which may be\r\nclassed as oceanic, because they have never formed parts of continents,\r\nbut have originated in mid-ocean, and have derived their forms of life\r\nby migration across the sea. Their peculiarities are seen to be very\r\nmarked in comparison with those islands which there is good reason to\r\nbelieve are really fragments of more extensive land areas, and are hence\r\ntermed \"continental.\" These continental islands consist in every case of\r\na variety of stratified rocks of various ages, thus corresponding\r\nclosely with the usual structure of continents; although many of the\r\nislands are small like Jersey or the Shetland Islands, or far from\r\ncontinental land like the Falkland Islands or New Zealand. They all\r\ncontain indigenous mammalia or batrachia, and generally a much greater\r\nvariety of birds, reptiles, insects, and plants, than do the oceanic\r\nislands. From these various characteristics we conclude that they have\r\nall once formed parts of continents, or at all events of much larger\r\nland areas, and have become isolated, either by subsidence of the\r\nintervening land or by the effects of long-continued marine denudation.\r\n\r\nNow, if we trace the thousand-fathom line around all our existing\r\ncontinents we find that, with only two exceptions, every island which\r\ncan be classed as \"continental\" falls within this line, while all that\r\nlie beyond it have the undoubted characteristics of \"oceanic\" islands.\r\nWe, therefore, conclude that the thousand-fathom line marks out,\r\napproximately, the \"continental area,\"--that is, the limits within which\r\ncontinental development and change throughout known geological time have\r\ngone on. There may, of course, have been some extensions of land beyond\r\nthis limit, while some areas within it may always have been ocean; but\r\nso far as we have any direct evidence, this line may be taken to mark\r\nout, approximately, the most probable boundary between the \"continental\r\narea,\" which has always consisted of land and shallow sea in varying\r\nproportions, and the great oceanic basins, within the limits of which\r\nvolcanic activity has been building up numerous islands, but whose\r\nprofound depths have apparently undergone little change.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Madagascar and New Zealand._\r\n\r\nThe two exceptions just referred to are Madagascar and New Zealand, and\r\nall the evidence goes to show that in these cases the land connection\r\nwith the nearest continental area was very remote in time. The\r\nextraordinary isolation of the productions of Madagascar--almost all the\r\nmost characteristic forms of mammalia, birds, and reptiles of Africa\r\nbeing absent from it--renders it certain that it must have been\r\nseparated from that continent very early in the Tertiary, if not as far\r\nback as the latter part of the Secondary period; and this extreme\r\nantiquity is indicated by a depth of considerably more than a thousand\r\nfathoms in the Mozambique Channel, though this deep portion is less than\r\na hundred miles wide between the Comoro Islands and the mainland.[166]\r\nMadagascar is the only island on the globe with a fairly rich mammalian\r\nfauna which is separated from a continent by a depth greater than a\r\nthousand fathoms; and no other island presents so many peculiarities in\r\nthese animals, or has preserved so many lowly organised and archaic\r\nforms. The exceptional character of its productions agrees exactly with\r\nits exceptional isolation by means of a very deep arm of the sea.\r\n\r\nNew Zealand possesses no known mammals and only a single species of\r\nbatrachian; but its geological structure is perfectly continental. There\r\nis also much evidence that it does possess one mammal, although no\r\nspecimens have been yet obtained.[167] Its reptiles and birds are highly\r\npeculiar and more numerous than in any truly oceanic island. Now the sea\r\nwhich directly separates New Zealand from Australia is more than 2000\r\nfathoms deep, but in a north-west direction there is an extensive bank\r\nunder 1000 fathoms, extending to and including Lord Howe's Island, while\r\nnorth of this are other banks of the same depth, approaching towards a\r\nsubmarine extension of Queensland on the one hand, and New Caledonia on\r\nthe other, and altogether suggestive of a land union with Australia at\r\nsome very remote period. Now the peculiar relations of the New Zealand\r\nfauna and flora with those of Australia and of the tropical Pacific\r\nIslands to the northward indicate such a connection, probably during the\r\nCretaceous period; and here, again, we have the exceptional depth of the\r\ndividing sea and the form of the ocean bottom according well with the\r\naltogether exceptional isolation of New Zealand, an isolation which has\r\nbeen held by some naturalists to be great enough to justify its claim to\r\nbe one of the primary Zoological Regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Teachings of the Thousand-Fathom Line._\r\n\r\nIf now we accept the annexed map as showing us approximately how far\r\nbeyond their present limits our continents may have extended during any\r\nportion of the Tertiary and Secondary periods, we shall obtain a\r\nfoundation of inestimable value for our inquiries into those migrations\r\nof animals and plants during past ages which have resulted in their\r\npresent peculiarities of distribution. We see, for instance, that the\r\nSouth American and African continents have always been separated by\r\nnearly as wide an ocean as at present, and that whatever similarities\r\nthere may be in their productions must be due to the similar forms\r\nhaving been derived from a common origin in one of the great northern\r\ncontinents. The radical difference between the higher forms of life of\r\nthe two continents accords perfectly with their permanent separation. If\r\nthere had been any direct connection between them during Tertiary times,\r\nwe should hardly have found the deep-seated differences between the\r\nQuadrumana of the two regions--no family even being common to both; nor\r\nthe peculiar Insectivora of the one continent, and the equally peculiar\r\nEdentata of the other. The very numerous families of birds quite\r\npeculiar to one or other of these continents, many of which, by their\r\nstructural isolation and varied development of generic and specific\r\nforms, indicate a high antiquity, equally suggest that there has been no\r\nnear approach to a land connection during the same epoch.\r\n\r\nLooking to the two great northern continents, we see indications of a\r\npossible connection between them both in the North Atlantic and the\r\nNorth Pacific oceans; and when we remember that from middle Tertiary\r\ntimes backward--so far as we know continuously to the earliest\r\nPalaeozoic epoch--a temperate and equable climate, with abundant woody\r\nvegetation, prevailed up to and within the arctic circle, we see what\r\nfacilities may have been afforded for migration from one continent to\r\nthe other, sometimes between America and Europe, sometimes between\r\nAmerica and Asia. Admitting these highly probable connections, no\r\nbridging of the Atlantic in more southern latitudes (of which there is\r\nnot a particle of evidence) will have been necessary to account for all\r\nthe intermigration that has occurred between the two continents. If, on\r\nthe other hand, we remember how long must have been the route, and how\r\ndiverse must always have been the conditions between the more northern\r\nand the more southern portions of the American and Euro-Asiatic\r\ncontinents, we shall not be surprised that many widespread forms in\r\neither continent have not crossed into the other; and that while the\r\nskunks (Mephitis), the pouched rats (Saccomyidae), and the turkeys\r\n(Meleagris) are confined to America, the pigs and the hedgehogs, the\r\ntrue flycatchers and the pheasants are found only in the Euro-Asiatic\r\ncontinent. But, just as there have been periods which facilitated\r\nintermigration between America and the Old World, there have almost\r\ncertainly been periods, perhaps of long duration even geologically, when\r\nthese continents have been separated by seas as wide as, or even wider\r\nthan, those of the present day; and thus may be explained such curious\r\nanomalies as the origination of the camel-tribe in America, and its\r\nentrance into Asia in comparatively recent Tertiary times, while the\r\nintroduction of oxen and bears into America from the Euro-Asiatic\r\ncontinent appears to have been equally recent.[168]\r\n\r\nWe shall find on examination that this view of the general permanence of\r\nthe oceanic and continental areas, with constant minor fluctuations of\r\nland and sea over the whole extent of the latter, enables us to\r\nunderstand, and offer a rational explanation of, most of the difficult\r\nproblems of geographical distribution; and further, that our power of\r\ndoing this is in direct proportion to our acquaintance with the\r\ndistribution of fossil forms of life during the Tertiary period. We\r\nmust, also, take due note of many other facts of almost equal importance\r\nfor a due appreciation of the problems presented for solution, the most\r\nessential being, the various powers of dispersal possessed by the\r\ndifferent groups of animals and plants, the geological antiquity of the\r\nspecies and genera, and the width and depth of the seas which separate\r\nthe countries they, inhabit. A few illustrations will now be given of\r\nthe way in which these branches of knowledge enable us to deal with the\r\ndifficulties and anomalies that present themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Distribution of Marsupials._\r\n\r\nThis singular and lowly organised type of mammals constitutes almost the\r\nsole representative of the class in Australia and New Guinea, while it\r\nis entirely unknown in Asia, Africa, or Europe. It reappears in America,\r\nwhere several species of opossums are found; and it was long thought\r\nnecessary to postulate a direct southern connection of these distant\r\ncountries, in order to account for this curious fact of distribution.\r\nWhen, however, we look to what is known of the geological history of the\r\nmarsupials the difficulty vanishes. In the Upper Eocene deposits of\r\nWestern Europe the remains of several animals closely allied to the\r\nAmerican opossums have been found; and as, at this period, a very mild\r\nclimate prevailed far up into the arctic regions, there is no difficulty\r\nin supposing that the ancestors of the group entered America from Europe\r\nor Northern Asia during early Tertiary times.\r\n\r\nBut we must go much further back for the origin of the Australian\r\nmarsupials. All the chief types of the higher mammalia were in existence\r\nin the Eocene, if not in the preceding Cretaceous period, and as we find\r\nnone of these in Australia, that country must have been finally\r\nseparated from the Asiatic continent during the Secondary or Mesozoic\r\nperiod. Now during that period, in the Upper and the Lower Oolite and in\r\nthe still older Trias, the jaw-bones of numerous small mammalia have\r\nbeen found, forming eight distinct genera, which are believed to have\r\nbeen either marsupials or some allied lowly forms. In North America\r\nalso, in beds of the Jurassic and Triassic formations, the remains of an\r\nequally great variety of these small mammalia have been discovered; and\r\nfrom the examination of more than sixty specimens, belonging to at least\r\nsix distinct genera, Professor Marsh is of opinion that they represent a\r\ngeneralised type, from which the more specialised marsupials and\r\ninsectivora were developed.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that very similar mammals occur both in Europe and America\r\nat corresponding periods, and in beds which represent a long succession\r\nof geological time, and that during the whole of this time no fragments\r\nof any higher forms have been discovered, it seems probable that both\r\nthe northern continents (or the larger portion of their area) were then\r\ninhabited by no other mammalia than these, with perhaps other equally\r\nlow types. It was, probably, not later than the Jurassic age when some\r\nof these primitive marsupials were able to enter Australia, where they\r\nhave since remained almost completely isolated; and, being free from\r\nthe competition of higher forms, they have developed into the great\r\nvariety of types we now behold there. These occupy the place, and have\r\nto some extent acquired the form and structure of distinct orders of the\r\nhigher mammals--the rodents, the insectivora, and the carnivora,--while\r\nstill preserving the essential characteristics and lowly organisation of\r\nthe marsupials. At a much later period--probably in late Tertiary\r\ntimes--the ancestors of the various species of rats and mice which now\r\nabound in Australia, and which, with the aerial bats, constitute its\r\nonly forms of placental mammals, entered the country from some of the\r\nadjacent islands. For this purpose a land connection was not necessary,\r\nas these small creatures might easily be conveyed among the branches or\r\nin the crevices of trees uprooted by floods and carried down to the sea,\r\nand then floated to a shore many miles distant. That no actual land\r\nconnection with, or very close approximation to, an Asiatic island has\r\noccurred in recent times, is sufficiently proved by the fact that no\r\nsquirrel, pig, civet, or other widespread mammal of the Eastern\r\nhemisphere has been able to reach the Australian continent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Distribution of Tapirs._\r\n\r\nThese curious animals form one of the puzzles of geographical\r\ndistribution, being now confined to two very remote regions of the\r\nglobe--the Malay Peninsula and adjacent islands of Sumatra and Borneo,\r\ninhabited by one species, and tropical America, where there are three or\r\nfour species, ranging from Brazil to Ecuador and Guatemala. If we\r\nconsidered these living forms only, we should be obliged to speculate on\r\nenormous changes of land and sea in order that these tropical animals\r\nmight have passed from one country to the other. But geological\r\ndiscoveries have rendered all such hypothetical changes unnecessary.\r\nDuring Miocene and Pliocene times tapirs abounded over the whole of\r\nEurope and Asia, their remains having been found in the tertiary\r\ndeposits of France, India, Burmah, and China. In both North and South\r\nAmerica fossil remains of tapirs occur only in caves and deposits of\r\nPost-Pliocene age, showing that they are comparatively recent immigrants\r\ninto that continent. They perhaps entered by the route of Kamchatka and\r\nAlaska, where the climate, even now so much milder and more equable than\r\non the north-east of America, might have been warm enough in late\r\nPliocene times to have allowed the migration of these animals. In Asia\r\nthey were driven southwards by the competition of numerous higher and\r\nmore powerful forms, but have found a last resting-place in the swampy\r\nforests of the Malay region.\r\n\r\n\r\n_What these Facts Prove._\r\n\r\nNow these two cases, of the marsupials and the tapirs, are in the\r\nhighest degree instructive, because they show us that, without any\r\nhypothetical bridging of deep oceans, and with only such changes of sea\r\nand land as are indicated by the extent of the comparatively shallow\r\nseas surrounding and connecting the existing continents, we are able to\r\naccount for the anomaly of allied forms occurring only in remote and\r\nwidely separated areas. These examples really constitute crucial tests,\r\nbecause, of all classes of animals, mammalia are least able to surmount\r\nphysical barriers. They are obviously unable to pass over wide arms of\r\nthe sea, while the necessity for constant supplies of food and water\r\nrenders sandy deserts or snow-clad plains equally impassable. Then,\r\nagain, the peculiar kinds of food on which alone many of them can\r\nsubsist, and their liability to the attacks of other animals, put a\r\nfurther check upon their migrations. In these respects almost all other\r\norganisms have great advantages over mammals. Birds can often fly long\r\ndistances, and can thus cross arms of the sea, deserts, or mountain\r\nranges; insects not only fly, but are frequently carried great distances\r\nby gales of wind, as shown by the numerous cases of their visits to\r\nships hundreds of miles from land. Reptiles, though slow of movement,\r\nhave advantages in their greater capacity for enduring hunger or thirst,\r\ntheir power of resisting cold or drought in a state of torpidity, and\r\nthey have also some facilities for migration across the sea by means of\r\ntheir eggs, which may be conveyed in crevices of timber or among masses\r\nof floating vegetable matter. And when we come to the vegetable kingdom,\r\nthe means of transport are at their maximum, numbers of seeds having\r\nspecial adaptations for being carried by mammalia or birds, and for\r\nfloating in the water, or through the air, while many are so small and\r\nso light that there is practically no limit to the distances they may be\r\ncarried by gales and hurricanes.\r\n\r\nWe may, therefore, feel quite certain that the means of distribution\r\nthat have enabled the larger mammalia to reach the most remote regions\r\nfrom a common starting-point, will be at least as efficacious, and\r\nusually far more efficacious, with all other land animals and plants;\r\nand if in every case the existing distribution of this class can be\r\nexplained on the theory of oceanic and continental permanence, with the\r\nlimited changes of sea and land already referred to, no valid objections\r\ncan be taken against this theory founded on anomalies of distribution in\r\nother orders. Yet nothing is more common than for students of this or\r\nthat group to assort that the theory of oceanic permanence is quite\r\ninconsistent with the distribution of its various species and genera.\r\nBecause a few Indian genera and closely allied species of birds are\r\nfound in Madagascar, a land termed \"Lemuria\" has been supposed to have\r\nunited the two countries during a comparatively recent geological epoch;\r\nwhile the similarity of fossil plants and reptiles, from the Permian and\r\nMiocene formations of India and South Africa, has been adduced as\r\nfurther evidence of this connection. But there are also genera of\r\nsnakes, of insects, and of plants, common to Madagascar and South\r\nAmerica only, which have been held to necessitate a direct land\r\nconnection between these countries. These views evidently refute\r\nthemselves, because any such land connections must have led to a far\r\ngreater similarity in the productions of the several countries than\r\nactually exists, and would besides render altogether inexplicable the\r\nabsence of all the chief types of African and Indian mammalia from\r\nMadagascar, and its marvellous individuality in every department of the\r\norganic world.[169]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Powers of Dispersal as illustrated by Insular Organisms._\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at the conclusion that our existing oceans have remained\r\npractically unaltered throughout the Tertiary and Secondary periods of\r\ngeology, and that the distribution of the mammalia is such as might\r\nhave been brought about by their known powers of dispersal, and by such\r\nchanges of land and sea as have probably or certainly occurred, we are,\r\nof course, restricted to similar causes to explain the much wider and\r\nsometimes more eccentric distribution of other classes of animals and of\r\nplants. In doing so, we have to rely partly on direct evidence of\r\ndispersal, afforded by the land organisms that have been observed far\r\nout at sea, or which have taken refuge on ships, as well as by the\r\nperiodical visitants to remote islands; but very largely on indirect\r\nevidence, afforded by the frequent presence of certain groups on remote\r\noceanic islands, which some ancestral forms must, therefore, have\r\nreached by transmission across the ocean from distant lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Birds._\r\n\r\nThese vary much in their powers of flight, and their capability of\r\ntraversing wide seas and oceans. Many swimming and wading birds can\r\ncontinue long on the wing, fly swiftly, and have, besides, the power of\r\nresting safely on the surface of the water. These would hardly be\r\nlimited by any width of ocean, except for the need of food; and many of\r\nthem, as the gulls, petrels, and divers, find abundance of food on the\r\nsurface of the sea itself. These groups have a wide distribution\r\n_across_ the oceans; while waders--especially plovers, sandpipers,\r\nsnipes, and herons--are equally cosmopolitan, travelling _along_ the\r\ncoasts of all the continents, and across the narrow seas which separate\r\nthem. Many of these birds seem unaffected by climate, and as the\r\norganisms on which they feed are equally abundant on arctic, temperate,\r\nand tropical shores, there is hardly any limit to the range even of some\r\nof the species.\r\n\r\nLand-birds are much more restricted in their range, owing to their\r\nusually limited powers of flight, their inability to rest on the surface\r\nof the sea or to obtain food from it, and their greater specialisation,\r\nwhich renders them less able to maintain themselves in the new countries\r\nthey may occasionally reach. Many of them are adapted to live only in\r\nwoods, or in marshes, or in deserts; they need particular kinds of food\r\nor a limited range of temperature; and they are adapted to cope only\r\nwith the special enemies or the particular group of competitors among\r\nwhich they have been developed. Such birds as these may pass again and\r\nagain to a new country, but are never able to establish themselves in\r\nit; and it is this organic barrier, as it is termed, rather than any\r\nphysical barrier, which, in many cases, determines the presence of a\r\nspecies in one area and its absence from another. We must always\r\nremember, therefore, that, although the presence of a species in a\r\nremote oceanic island clearly proves that its ancestors must at one time\r\nhave found their way there, the absence of a species does not prove the\r\ncontrary, since it also may have reached the island, but have been\r\nunable to maintain itself, owing to the inorganic or organic conditions\r\nnot being suitable to it. This general principle applies to all classes\r\nof organisms, and there are many striking illustrations of it. In the\r\nAzores there are eighteen species of land-birds which are permanent\r\nresidents, but there are also several others which reach the islands\r\nalmost every year after great storms, but have never been able to\r\nestablish themselves. In Bermuda the facts are still more striking,\r\nsince there are only ten species of resident birds, while no less than\r\ntwenty other species of land-birds and more than a hundred species of\r\nwaders and aquatics are frequent visitors, often in great numbers, but\r\nare never able to establish themselves. On the same principle we account\r\nfor the fact that, of the many continental insects and birds that have\r\nbeen let loose, or have escaped from confinement, in this country,\r\nhardly one has been able to maintain itself, and the same phenomenon is\r\nstill more striking in the case of plants. Of the thousands of hardy\r\nplants which grow easily in our gardens, very few have ever run wild,\r\nand when the experiment is purposely tried it invariably fails. Thus A.\r\nde Candolle informs us that several botanists of Paris, Geneva, and\r\nespecially of Montpellier, have sown the seeds of many hundreds of\r\nspecies of exotic hardy plants, in what appeared to be the most\r\nfavourable situations, but that in hardly a single case has any one of\r\nthem become naturalised.[170] Still more, then, in plants than in\r\nanimals the absence of a species does not prove that it has never\r\nreached the locality, but merely that it has not been able to maintain\r\nitself in competition with the native productions. In other cases, as\r\nwe have seen, facts of an exactly opposite nature occur. The rat, the\r\npig, and the rabbit, the water-cress, the clover, and many other plants,\r\nwhen introduced into New Zealand, nourish exceedingly, and even\r\nexterminate their native competitors; so that in these cases we may feel\r\nsure that the species in question did not exist in New Zealand simply\r\nbecause they had been unable to reach that country by their natural\r\nmeans of dispersal. I will now give a few cases, in addition to those\r\nrecorded in my previous works, of birds and insects which have been\r\nobserved far from any land.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Birds and Insects at Sea._\r\n\r\nCaptain D. Fullarton of the ship _Timaru_ recorded in his log the\r\noccurrence of a great number of small land-birds about the ship on 15th\r\nMarch 1886, when in Lat. 48° 31' N., Long. 8° 16' W. He says: \"A great\r\nmany small land-birds about us; put about sixty into a coop, evidently\r\ntired out.\" And two days later, 17th March, \"Over fifty of the birds\r\ncooped on 15th died, though fed. Sparrows, finches, water-wagtails, two\r\nsmall birds, name unknown, one kind like a linnet, and a large bird like\r\na starling. In all there have been on board over seventy birds, besides\r\nsome that hovered about us for some time and then fell into the sea\r\nexhausted.\" Easterly winds and severe weather were experienced at the\r\ntime.[171] The spot where this remarkable flight of birds was met with\r\nis about 160 miles due west of Brest, and this is the least distance the\r\nbirds must have been carried. It is interesting to note that the\r\nposition of the ship is nearly in the line from the English and French\r\ncoasts to the Azores, where, after great storms, so many bird stragglers\r\narrive annually. These birds were probably blown out to sea during their\r\nspring migration along the south coast of England to Wales and Ireland.\r\nDuring the autumnal migration, however, great flocks of\r\nbirds--especially starlings, thrushes, and fieldfares--have been\r\nobserved every year flying out to sea from the west coast of Ireland,\r\nalmost the whole of which must perish. At the Nash Lighthouse, in the\r\nBristol Channel on the coast of Glamorganshire, an enormous number of\r\nsmall birds were observed on 3d September, including nightjars,\r\nbuntings, white-throats, willow-wrens, cuckoos, house-sparrows, robins,\r\nwheatears, and blackbirds. These had probably crossed from\r\nSomersetshire, and had they been caught by a storm the larger portion of\r\nthem must have been blown out to sea.[172]\r\n\r\nThese facts enable us to account sufficiently well for the birds of\r\noceanic islands, the number and variety of which are seen to be\r\nproportionate to their facilities for reaching the island and\r\nmaintaining themselves in it. Thus, though more birds yearly reach\r\nBermuda than the Azores, the number of residents in the latter islands\r\nis much larger, due to the greater extent of the islands, their number,\r\nand their more varied surface. In the Galapagos the land-birds are still\r\nmore numerous, due in part to their larger area and greater proximity to\r\nthe continent, but chiefly to the absence of storms, so that the birds\r\nwhich originally reached the islands have remained long isolated and\r\nhave developed into many closely allied species adapted to the special\r\nconditions. All the species of the Galapagos but one are peculiar to the\r\nislands, while the Azores possess only one peculiar species, and Bermuda\r\nnone--a fact which is clearly due to the continual immigration of fresh\r\nindividuals keeping up the purity of the breed by intercrossing. In the\r\nSandwich Islands, which are extremely isolated, being more than 2000\r\nmiles from any continent or large island, we have a condition of things\r\nsimilar to what prevails in the Galapagos, the land-birds, eighteen in\r\nnumber, being all peculiar, and belonging, except one, to peculiar\r\ngenera. These birds have probably all descended from three or four\r\noriginal types which reached the islands at some remote period, probably\r\nby means of intervening islets that have since disappeared. In St.\r\nHelena we have a degree of permanent isolation which has prevented any\r\nland-birds from reaching the island; for although its distance from the\r\ncontinent, 1100 miles, is not so great as in the case of the Sandwich\r\nIslands, it is situated in an ocean almost entirely destitute of small\r\nislands, while its position within the tropics renders it free from\r\nviolent storms. Neither is there, on the nearest part of the coast of\r\nAfrica, a perpetual stream of migrating birds like that which supplies\r\nthe innumerable stragglers which every year reach Bermuda and the\r\nAzores.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Insects._\r\n\r\nWinged insects have been mainly dispersed in the same way as birds, by\r\ntheir power of flight, aided by violent or long-continued winds. Being\r\nso small, and of such low specific gravity, they are occasionally\r\ncarried to still greater distances; and thus no islands, however remote,\r\nare altogether without them. The eggs of insects, being often deposited\r\nin borings or in crevices of timber, may have been conveyed long\r\ndistances by floating trees, as may the larvae of those species which\r\nfeed on wood. Several cases have been published of insects coming on\r\nboard ships at great distances from land; and Darwin records having\r\ncaught a large grasshopper when the ship was 370 miles from the coast of\r\nAfrica, whence the insect had probably come.\r\n\r\nIn the _Entomologists' Monthly Magazine_ for June 1885, Mr. MacLachlan\r\nhas recorded the occurrence of a swarm of moths in the Atlantic ocean,\r\nfrom the log of the ship _Pleione_. The vessel was homeward bound from\r\nNew Zealand, and in Lat. 6° 47' N., Long. 32° 50' W., hundreds of moths\r\nappeared about the ship, settling in numbers on the spars and rigging.\r\nThe wind for four days previously had been very light from north,\r\nnorth-west, or north-east, and sometimes calm. The north-east trade wind\r\noccasionally extends to the ship's position at that time of year. The\r\ncaptain adds that \"frequently, in that part of the ocean, he has had\r\nmoths and butterflies come on board.\" The position is 960 miles\r\nsouth-west of the Cape Verde Islands, and about 440 north-east of the\r\nSouth American coast. The specimen preserved is Deiopeia pulchella, a\r\nvery common species in dry localities in the Eastern tropics, and rarely\r\nfound in Britain, but, Mr. MacLachlan thinks, not found in South\r\nAmerica. They must have come, therefore, from the Cape Verde Islands, or\r\nfrom some parts of the African coast, and must have traversed about a\r\nthousand miles of ocean with the assistance, no doubt, of a strong\r\nnorth-east trade wind for a great part of the distance. In the British\r\nMuseum collection there is a specimen of the same moth caught at sea\r\nduring the voyage of the _Rattlesnake_, in Lat. 6° N., Long. 22-1/2°\r\nW., being between the former position and Sierra Leone, thus rendering\r\nit probable that the moths came from that part of the African coast, in\r\nwhich case the swarm encountered by the _Pleione_ must have travelled\r\nmore than 1200 miles.\r\n\r\nA similar case was recorded by Mr. F.A. Lucas in the American periodical\r\n_Science_ of 8th April 1887. He states that in 1870 he met with numerous\r\nmoths of many species while at sea in the South Atlantic (Lat. 25° S.,\r\nLong. 24° W.), about 1000 miles from the coast of Brazil. As this\r\nposition is just beyond the south-east trades, the insects may have been\r\nbrought from the land by a westerly gale. In the _Zoologist_ (1864, p.\r\n8920) is the record of a small longicorn beetle which flew on board a\r\nship 500 miles off the west coast of Africa. Numerous other cases are\r\nrecorded of insects at less distances from land, and, taken in\r\nconnection with those already given, they are sufficient to show that\r\ngreat numbers must be continually carried out to sea, and that\r\noccasionally they are able to reach enormous distances. But the\r\nreproductive powers of insects are so great that all we require, in\r\norder to stock a remote island, is that some few specimens shall reach\r\nit even once in a century, or once in a thousand years.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Insects at great Altitudes._\r\n\r\nEqually important is the proof we possess that insects are often carried\r\nto great altitudes by upward currents of air. Humboldt noticed them up\r\nto heights of 15,000 and 18,000 feet in South America, and Mr. Albert\r\nMüller has collected many interesting cases of the same character in\r\nEurope.[173] A moth (Plusia gamma) has been found on the summit of Mont\r\nBlanc; small hymenoptera and moths have been seen on the Pyrenees at a\r\nheight of 11,000 feet, while numerous flies and beetles, some of\r\nconsiderable size, have been caught on the glaciers and snow-fields of\r\nvarious parts of the Alps. Upward currents of air, whirlwinds and\r\ntornadoes, occur in all parts of the world, and large numbers of insects\r\nare thus carried up into the higher regions of the atmosphere, where\r\nthey are liable to be caught by strong winds, and thus conveyed enormous\r\ndistances over seas or continents. With such powerful means of\r\ndispersal the distribution of insects over the entire globe, and their\r\npresence in the most remote oceanic islands, offer no difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Dispersal of Plants._\r\n\r\nThe dispersal of seeds is effected in a greater variety of ways than are\r\navailable in the case of any animals. Some fruits or seed-vessels, and\r\nsome seeds, will float for many weeks, and after immersion in salt water\r\nfor that period the seeds will often germinate. Extreme cases are the\r\ndouble cocoa-nut of the Seychelles, which has been found on the coast of\r\nSumatra, about 3000 miles distant; the fruits of the Sapindus saponaria\r\n(soap-berry), which has been brought to Bermuda by the Gulf Stream from\r\nthe West Indies, and has grown after a journey in the sea of about 1500\r\nmiles; and the West Indian bean, Entada scandens, which reached the\r\nAzores from the West Indies, a distance of full 3000 miles, and\r\nafterwards germinated at Kew. By these means we can account for the\r\nsimilarity in the shore flora of the Malay Archipelago and most of the\r\nislands of the Pacific; and from an examination of the fruits and seeds,\r\ncollected among drift during the voyage of the _Challenger_, Mr. Hemsley\r\nhas compiled a list of 121 species which are probably widely dispersed\r\nby this means.\r\n\r\nA still larger number of species owe their dispersal to birds in several\r\ndistinct ways. An immense number of fruits in all parts of the world are\r\ndevoured by birds, and have been attractively coloured (as we have\r\nseen), in order to be so devoured, because the seeds pass through the\r\nbirds' bodies and germinate where they fall. We have seen how frequently\r\nbirds are forced by gales of wind across a wide expanse of ocean, and\r\nthus seeds must be occasionally carried. It is a very suggestive fact,\r\nthat all the trees and shrubs in the Azores bear berries or small fruits\r\nwhich are eaten by birds; while all those which bear larger fruits, or\r\nare eaten chiefly by mammals--such as oaks, beeches, hazels, crabs,\r\netc.--are entirely wanting. Game-birds and waders often have portions of\r\nmud attached to their feet, and Mr. Darwin has proved by experiment that\r\nsuch mud frequently contains seeds. One partridge had such a quantity of\r\nmud attached to its foot as to contain seeds from which eighty-two\r\nplants germinated; this proves that a very small portion of mud may\r\nserve to convey seeds, and such an occurrence repeated even at long\r\nintervals may greatly aid in stocking remote islands with vegetation.\r\nMany seeds also adhere to the feathers of birds, and thus, again, may be\r\nconveyed as far as birds are ever carried. Dr. Guppy found a small hard\r\nseed in the gizzard of a Cape Petrel, taken about 550 miles east of\r\nTristan da Cunha.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dispersal of Seeds by the Wind._\r\n\r\nIn the preceding cases we have been able to obtain direct evidence of\r\ntransportal; but although we know that many seeds are specially adapted\r\nto be dispersed by the wind, we cannot obtain direct proof that they are\r\nso carried for hundreds or thousands of miles across the sea, owing to\r\nthe difficulty of detecting single objects which are so small and\r\ninconspicuous. It is probable, however, that the wind as an agent of\r\ndispersal is really more effective than any of those we have hitherto\r\nconsidered, because a very large number of plants have seeds which are\r\nvery small and light, and are often of such a form as to facilitate\r\naerial carriage for enormous distances. It is evident that such seeds\r\nare especially liable to be transported by violent winds, because they\r\nbecome ripe in autumn at the time when storms are most prevalent, while\r\nthey either lie upon the surface of the ground, or are disposed in dry\r\ncapsules on the plant ready to be blown away. If inorganic particles\r\ncomparable in weight, size, or form with such seeds are carried for\r\ngreat distances, we may be sure that seeds will also be occasionally\r\ncarried in the same way. It will, therefore, be necessary to give a few\r\nexamples of wind-carriage of small objects.\r\n\r\nOn 27th July 1875 a remarkable shower of small pieces of hay occurred at\r\nMonkstown, near Dublin. They appeared floating slowly down from a great\r\nheight, as if falling from a dark cloud which hung overhead. The pieces\r\npicked up were wet, and varied from single blades of grass to tufts\r\nweighing one or two ounces. A similar shower occurred a few days earlier\r\nin Denbighshire, and was observed to travel in a direction contrary to\r\nthat of the wind in the lower atmosphere.[174] There is no evidence of\r\nthe distance from which the hay was brought, but as it had been carried\r\nto a great height, it was in a position to be conveyed to almost any\r\ndistance by a violent wind, had such occurred at the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mineral Matter carried by the Wind._\r\n\r\nThe numerous cases of sand and volcanic dust being carried enormous\r\ndistances through the atmosphere sufficiently prove the importance of\r\nwind as a carrier of solid matter, but unfortunately the matter\r\ncollected has not been hitherto examined with a view to determine the\r\nmaximum size and weight of the particles. A few facts, however, have\r\nbeen kindly furnished me by Professor Judd, F.R.S. Some dust which fell\r\nat Genoa on 15th October 1885, and was believed to have been brought\r\nfrom the African desert, consisted of quartz, hornblende, and other\r\nminerals, and contained particles having a diameter of 1/500 inch, each\r\nweighing 1/200,000 grain. This dust had probably travelled over 600\r\nmiles. In the dust from Krakatoa, which fell at Batavia, about 100 miles\r\ndistant, during the great eruption, there are many solid particles even\r\nlarger than those mentioned above. Some of this dust was given me by\r\nProfessor Judd, and I found in it several ovoid particles of a much\r\nlarger size, being 1/50 inch long, and 1/70 wide and deep. The dust from\r\nthe same eruption, which fell on board the ship _Arabella_, 970 miles\r\nfrom the volcano, also contained solid particles 1/500 inch diameter.\r\nMr. John Murray of the _Challenger_ Expedition writes to me that he\r\nfinds in the deep sea deposits 500 and even 700 miles west of the coast\r\nof Africa, rounded particles of quartz, having a diameter of 1/250 inch,\r\nand similar particles are found at equally great distances from the\r\nsouth-west coasts of Australia; and he considers these to be atmospheric\r\ndust carried to that distance by the wind. Taking the sp. gr. of quartz\r\nat 2.6, these particles would weigh about 1/25,000 grain each. These\r\ninteresting facts can, however, by no means be taken as indicating the\r\nextreme limits of the power of wind in carrying solid particles. During\r\nthe Krakatoa eruption no gale of special violence occurred, and the\r\nregion is one of comparative calms. The grains of quartz found by Mr.\r\nMurray more nearly indicate the limit, but the very small portions of\r\nmatter brought up by the dredge, as compared with the enormous areas of\r\nsea-bottom, over which the atmospheric dust must have been scattered,\r\nrender it in the highest degree improbable that the maximum limit either\r\nof size of particles, or of distance from land has been reached.\r\n\r\nLet us, however, assume that the quartz grains, found by Mr. Murray in\r\nthe deep-sea ooze 700 miles from land, give us the extreme limit of the\r\npower of the atmosphere as a carrier of solid particles, and let us\r\ncompare with these the weights of some seeds. From a small collection of\r\nthe seeds of thirty species of herbaceous plants sent me from Kew, those\r\nin the above table were selected, and small portions of eight of them\r\ncarefully weighed in a chemical balance.[175] By counting these portions\r\nI was able to estimate the number of seeds weighing one grain. The three\r\nvery minute species, whose numbers are marked with an asterisk (*), were\r\nestimated by the comparison of their sizes with those of the smaller\r\nweighed seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo|    Species.         |Approximate |      Approximate  |  Remarks.\r\n  |                     |No. of Seeds|      Dimensions.  |\r\n  |                     |In one Grain|                   |\r\n  |                     |            | in.    in.    in. |\r\n 1|Draba verna          |  1,800     |1/60 x 1/90 x 1/160|Oval, flat.\r\n 2|Hypericum perforatum |    520     |      1/30 x 1/80  |Cylindrical.\r\n 3|Astilbe rivularis    |  4,500     |      1/50 x 1/100 |Elongate, flat, tailed,\r\n  |                     |            |                   |   wavy.\r\n 4|Saxifraga coriophylla|    750     |      1/40 x 1/75  |Surface rough, adhere\r\n  |                     |            |                   |   to the dry capsules.\r\n 5|Oenothera rosea      |    640     |  1/40 x 1/80      |Ovate.\r\n 6|Hypericum hirsutum   |    700     |      1/30 x 1/100 |Cylindrical, rough.\r\n 7|Mimulus luteus       |  2,900     |      1/60 x 1/100 |Oval, minute.\r\n 8|Penthorum sedoides   |  8,000*    |      1/70 x 1/150 |Flattened, very minute.\r\n 9|Sagina procumbens    | 12,000*    |          1/120    |Sub-triangular, flat.\r\n10|Orchis maculata      | 15,000*    |           ---     |Margined, flat,\r\n  |                     |            |                   | very minute.\r\n11|Gentiana purpurea    |     35     |           1/25    |Wavy, rough, with this\r\n  |                     |            |                   |   coriaceous margins.\r\n12|Silene alpina        |   ---      |           1/30    |Flat, with fringed\r\n  |                     |            |                   |   margins.\r\n13|Adenophora communis  |   ---      |       1/20 x 1/40 |Very thin, wavy, light.\r\n  |Quartz grains        | 25,000     |           1/250   |Deep sea ... 700 miles.\r\n  |Do.                  |200,000     |           1/500   |Genoa ... 600 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf now we compare the seeds with the quartz grains, we find that\r\nseveral are from twice to three times the weight of the grains found by\r\nMr. Murray, and others five times, eight times, and fifteen times as\r\nheavy; but they are proportionately very much larger, and, being usually\r\nirregular in shape or compressed, they expose a very much larger surface\r\nto the air. The surface is often rough, and several have dilated margins\r\nor tailed appendages, increasing friction and rendering the uniform rate\r\nof falling through still air immensely less than in the case of the\r\nsmooth, rounded, solid quartz grains. With these advantages it is a\r\nmoderate estimate that seeds ten times the weight of the quartz grains\r\ncould be carried quite as far through the air by a violent gale and\r\nunder the most favourable conditions. These limits will include five of\r\nthe seeds here given, as well as hundreds of others which do not exceed\r\nthem in weight; and to these we may add some larger seeds which have\r\nother favourable characteristics, as is the case with numbers 11-13,\r\nwhich, though very much larger than the rest, are so formed as in all\r\nprobability to be still more easily carried great distances by a gale of\r\nwind. It appears, therefore, to be absolutely certain that every\r\nautumnal gale capable of conveying solid mineral particles to great\r\ndistances, must also carry numbers of small seeds at least as far; and\r\nif this is so, the wind alone will form one of the most effective agents\r\nin the dispersal of plants.\r\n\r\nHitherto this mode of conveyance, as applying to the transmission of\r\nseeds for great distances across the ocean, has been rejected by\r\nbotanists, for two reasons. In the first place, there is said to be no\r\ndirect evidence of such conveyance; and, secondly, the peculiar plants\r\nof remote oceanic islands do not appear to have seeds specially adapted\r\nfor aerial transmission. I will consider briefly each of these\r\nobjections.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Objection to the Theory of Wind-Dispersal._\r\n\r\nTo obtain direct evidence of the transmission of such minute and\r\nperishable objects, which do not exist in great quantities, and are\r\nprobably carried to the greatest distances but rarely and as single\r\nspecimens, is extremely difficult. A bird or insect can be seen if it\r\ncomes on board ship, but who would ever detect the seeds of Mimulus or\r\nOrchis even if a score of them fell on a ship's deck? Yet if but one\r\nsuch seed per century were carried to an oceanic island, that island\r\nmight become rapidly overrun by the plant, if the conditions were\r\nfavourable to its growth and reproduction. It is further objected that\r\nsearch has been made for such seeds, and they have not been found.\r\nProfessor Kerner of Innsbruck examined the snow on the surface of\r\nglaciers, and assiduously collected all the seeds he could find, and\r\nthese were all of plants which grew in the adjacent mountains or in the\r\nsame district. In like manner, the plants growing on moraines were found\r\nto be those of the adjacent mountains, plateaux, or lowlands. Hence he\r\nconcluded that the prevalent opinion that seeds may be carried through\r\nthe air for very great distances \"is not supported by fact.\"[176] The\r\nopinion is certainly not supported by Kerner's facts, but neither is it\r\nopposed by them. It is obvious that the seeds that would be carried by\r\nthe wind to moraines or to the surface of glaciers would be, first and\r\nin the greatest abundance, those of the immediately surrounding\r\ndistrict; then, very much more rarely, those from more remote mountains;\r\nand lastly, in extreme rarity, those from distant countries or\r\naltogether distinct mountain ranges. Let us suppose the first to be so\r\nabundant that a single seed could be found by industrious search on each\r\nsquare yard of the surface of the glacier; the second so scarce that\r\nonly one could possibly be found in a hundred yards square; while to\r\nfind one of the third class it would be necessary exhaustively to\r\nexamine a square mile of surface. Should we expect that _one_ ever to be\r\nfound, and should the fact that it could not be found be taken as a\r\nproof that it was not there? Besides, a glacier is altogether in a bad\r\nposition to receive such remote wanderers, since it is generally\r\nsurrounded by lofty mountains, often range behind range, which would\r\nintercept the few air-borne seeds that might have been carried from a\r\ndistant land. The conditions in an oceanic island, on the other hand,\r\nare the most favourable, since the land, especially if high, will\r\nintercept objects carried by the wind, and will thus cause more of the\r\nsolid matter to fall on it than on an equal area of ocean. We know that\r\nwinds at sea often blow violently for days together, and the rate of\r\nmotion is indicated by the fact that 72 miles an hour was the average\r\nvelocity of the wind observed during twelve hours at the Ben Nevis\r\nobservatory, while the velocity sometimes rises to 120 miles an hour. A\r\ntwelve hours' gale might, therefore, carry light seeds a thousand miles\r\nas easily and certainly as it could carry quartz-grains of much greater\r\nspecific gravity, rotundity, and smoothness, 500 or even 100 miles; and\r\nit is difficult even to imagine a sufficient reason why they should not\r\nbe so carried--perhaps very rarely and under exceptionally favourable\r\nconditions,--but this is all that is required.\r\n\r\nAs regards the second objection, it has been observed that orchideae,\r\nwhich have often exceedingly small and light seeds, are remarkably\r\nabsent from oceanic islands. This, however, may be very largely due to\r\ntheir extreme specialisation and dependence on insect agency for their\r\nfertilisation; while the fact that they do occur in such very remote\r\nislands as the Azores, Tahiti, and the Sandwich Islands, proves that\r\nthey must have once reached these localities either by the agency of\r\nbirds or by transmission through the air; and the facts I have given\r\nabove render the latter mode at least as probable as the former. Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker remarks on the composite plant of Kerguelen Island (Cotula\r\nplumosa) being found also on Lord Auckland and MacQuarrie Islands, and\r\nyet having no pappus, while other species of the genus possess it. This\r\nis certainly remarkable, and proves that the plant must have, or once\r\nhave had, some other means of dispersal across wide oceans.[177] One of\r\nthe most widely dispersed species in the whole world (Sonchus oleraceus)\r\npossesses pappus, as do four out of five of the species which are common\r\nto Europe and New Zealand, all of which have a very wide distribution.\r\nThe same author remarks on the limited area occupied by most species of\r\nCompositae, notwithstanding their facilities for dispersal by means of\r\ntheir feathered seeds; but it has been already shown that limitations\r\nof area are almost always due to the competition of allied forms,\r\nfacilities for dispersal being only one of many factors in determining\r\nthe wide range of species. It is, however, a specially important factor\r\nin the case of the inhabitants of remote oceanic islands, since, whether\r\nthey are peculiar species or not, they or their remote ancestors must at\r\nsome time or other have reached their present position by natural means.\r\n\r\nI have already shown elsewhere, that the flora of the Azores strikingly\r\nsupports the view of the species having been introduced by aerial\r\ntransmission only, that is, by the agency of birds and the wind, because\r\nall plants that could not possibly have been carried by these means are\r\nabsent.[178] In the same way we may account for the extreme rarity of\r\nLeguminosae in all oceanic islands. Mr. Hemsley, in his Report on\r\nInsular Floras, says that they \"are wanting in a large number of oceanic\r\nislands where there is no true littoral flora,\" as St. Helena, Juan\r\nFernandez, and all the islands of the South Atlantic and South Indian\r\nOceans. Even in the tropical islands, such as Mauritius and Bourbon,\r\nthere are no endemic species, and very few in the Galapagos and the\r\nremoter Pacific Islands. All these facts are quite in accordance with\r\nthe absence of facilities for transmission through the air, either by\r\nbirds or the wind, owing to the comparatively large size and weight of\r\nthe seeds; and an additional proof is thus afforded of the extreme\r\nrarity of the successful floating of seeds for great distances across\r\nthe ocean.[179]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Explanation of North Temperate Plants in the Southern Hemisphere._\r\n\r\nIf we now admit that many seeds which are either minute in size, of thin\r\ntexture or wavy form, or so fringed or margined as to afford a good hold\r\nto the air, are capable of being carried for many hundreds of miles by\r\nexceptionally violent and long-continued gales of wind, we shall not\r\nonly be better able to account for the floras of some of the remotest\r\noceanic islands, but shall also find in the fact a sufficient\r\nexplanation of the wide diffusion of many genera, and even species, of\r\narctic and north temperate plants in the southern hemisphere or on the\r\nsummits of tropical mountains. Nearly fifty of the flowering plants of\r\nTierra-del-Fuego are found also in North America or Europe, but in no\r\nintermediate country; while fifty-eight species are common to New\r\nZealand and Northern Europe; thirty-eight to Australia, Northern Europe,\r\nand Asia; and no less than seventy-seven common to New Zealand,\r\nAustralia, and South America.[180] On lofty mountains far removed from\r\neach other, identical or closely allied plants often occur. Thus the\r\nfine Primula imperialis of a single mountain peak in Java has been found\r\n(or a closely allied species) in the Himalayas; and many other plants of\r\nthe high mountains of Java, Ceylon, and North India are either identical\r\nor closely allied forms. So, in Africa, some species, found on the\r\nsummits of the Cameroons and Fernando Po in West Africa, are closely\r\nallied to species in the Abyssinian highlands and in Temperate Europe;\r\nwhile other Abyssinian and Cameroons species have recently been found on\r\nthe mountains of Madagascar. Some peculiar Australian forms have been\r\nfound represented on the summit of Kini Balu in Borneo. Again, on the\r\nsummit of the Organ mountains in Brazil there are species allied to\r\nthose of the Andes, but not found in the intervening lowlands.\r\n\r\n\r\n_No Proof of Recent Lower Temperature in the Tropics._\r\n\r\nNow all these facts, and numerous others of like character, were\r\nsupposed by Mr. Darwin to be due to a lowering of temperature during\r\nglacial epochs, which allowed these temperate forms to migrate across\r\nthe intervening tropical lowlands. But any such change within the epoch\r\nof existing species is almost inconceivable. In the first place, it\r\nwould necessitate the extinction of much of the tropical flora (and with\r\nit of the insect life), because without such extinction alpine\r\nherbaceous plants could certainly never spread over tropical forest\r\nlowlands; and, in the next place, there is not a particle of direct\r\nevidence that any such lowering of temperature in inter-tropical\r\nlowlands ever took place. The only alleged evidence of the kind is that\r\nadduced by the late Professor Agassiz and Mr. Hartt; but I am informed\r\nby my friend, Mr. J.C. Branner (now State Geologist of Arkansas, U.S.),\r\nwho succeeded Mr. Hartt, and spent several years completing the\r\ngeological survey of Brazil, that the supposed moraines and glaciated\r\ngranite rocks near Rio Janeiro and elsewhere, as well as the so-called\r\nboulder-clay of the same region, are entirely explicable as the results\r\nof sub-aerial denudation and weathering, and that there is no proof\r\nwhatever of glaciation in any part of Brazil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lower Temperature not needed to Explain the Facts._\r\n\r\nBut any such vast physical change as that suggested by Darwin, involving\r\nas it does such tremendous issues as regards its effects on the tropical\r\nfauna and flora of the whole world, is really quite uncalled for,\r\nbecause the facts to be explained are of the same essential nature as\r\nthose presented by remote oceanic islands, between which and the nearest\r\ncontinents no temperate land connection is postulated. In proportion to\r\ntheir limited area and extreme isolation, the Azores, St. Helena, the\r\nGalapagos, and the Sandwich Islands, each possess a fairly rich--the\r\nlast a very rich--indigenous flora; and the means which sufficed to\r\nstock them with a great variety of plants would probably suffice to\r\ntransmit others from mountain-top to mountain-top in various parts of\r\nthe globe. In the case of the Azores, we have large numbers of species\r\nidentical with those of Europe, and others closely allied, forming an\r\nexactly parallel case to the species found on the various mountain\r\nsummits which have been referred to. The distances from Madagascar to\r\nthe South African mountains and to Kilimandjaro, and from the latter to\r\nAbyssinia, are no greater than from Spain to the Azores, while there are\r\nother equatorial mountains forming stepping-stones at about an equal\r\ndistance to the Cameroons. Between Java and the Himalayas we have the\r\nlofty mountains of Sumatra and of North-western Burma, forming steps at\r\nabout the same distance apart; while between Kini Balu and the\r\nAustralian Alps we have the unexplored snow mountains of New Guinea,\r\nthe Bellenden Ker mountains in Queensland, and the New England and Blue\r\nMountains of New South Wales. Between Brazil and Bolivia the distances\r\nare no greater; while the unbroken range of mountains from Arctic\r\nAmerica to Tierra-del-Fuego offers the greatest facilities for\r\ntransmission, the partial gap between the lofty peak of Chiriqui and the\r\nhigh Andes of New Grenada being far less than from Spain to the Azores.\r\nThus, whatever means have sufficed for stocking oceanic islands must\r\nhave been to some extent effective in transmitting northern forms from\r\nmountain to mountain, across the equator, to the southern hemisphere;\r\nwhile for this latter form of dispersal there are special facilities, in\r\nthe abundance of fresh and unoccupied surfaces always occurring in\r\nmountain regions, owing to avalanches, torrents, mountain-slides, and\r\nrock-falls, thus affording stations on which air-borne seeds may\r\ngerminate and find a temporary home till driven out by the inroads of\r\nthe indigenous vegetation. These temporary stations may be at much lower\r\naltitudes than the original habitat of the species, if other conditions\r\nare favourable. Alpine plants often descend into the valleys on glacial\r\nmoraines, while some arctic species grow equally well on mountain\r\nsummits and on the seashore. The distances above referred to between the\r\nloftier mountains may thus be greatly reduced by the occurrence of\r\nsuitable conditions at lower altitudes, and the facilities for\r\ntransmission by means of aerial currents proportionally increased.[181]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Facts Explained by the Wind-Carriage of Seeds._\r\n\r\nBut if we altogether reject aerial transmission of seeds for great\r\ndistances, except by the agency of birds, it will be difficult, if not\r\nimpossible, to account for the presence of so many identical species of\r\nplants on remote mountain summits, or for that \"continuous current of\r\nvegetation\" described by Sir Joseph Hooker as having apparently long\r\nexisted from the northern to the southern hemisphere. It may be admitted\r\nthat we can, possibly, account for the greater portion of the floras of\r\nremote oceanic islands by the agency of birds alone; because, when blown\r\nout to sea land-birds must reach some island or perish, and all which\r\ncome within sight of an island will struggle to reach it as their only\r\nrefuge. But, with mountain summits the case is altogether different,\r\nbecause, being surrounded by land instead of by sea, no bird would need\r\nto fly, or to be carried by the wind, for several hundred miles at a\r\nstretch to another mountain summit, but would find a refuge in the\r\nsurrounding uplands, ridges, valleys, or plains. As a rule the birds\r\nthat frequent lofty mountain tops are peculiar species, allied to those\r\nof the surrounding district; and there is no indication whatever of the\r\npassage of birds from one remote mountain to another in any way\r\ncomparable with the flights of birds which are known to reach the Azores\r\nannually, or even with the few regular migrants from Australia to New\r\nZealand. It is almost impossible to conceive that the seeds of the\r\nHimalayan primula should have been thus carried to Java; but, by means\r\nof gales of wind, and intermediate stations from fifty to a few hundred\r\nmiles apart, where the seeds might vegetate for a year or two and\r\nproduce fresh seed to be again carried on in the same manner, the\r\ntransmission might, after many failures, be at last effected.\r\n\r\nA very important consideration is the vastly larger scale on which\r\nwind-carriage of seeds must act, as compared with bird-carriage. It can\r\nonly be a few birds which carry seeds attached to their feathers or\r\nfeet. A very small proportion of these would carry the seeds of Alpine\r\nplants; while an almost infinitesimal fraction of these latter would\r\nconvey the few seeds attached to them safely to an oceanic island or\r\nremote mountain. But winds, in the form of whirlwinds or tornadoes,\r\ngales or hurricanes, are perpetually at work over large areas of land\r\nand sea. Insects and light particles of matter are often carried up to\r\nthe tops of high mountains; and, from the very nature and origin of\r\nwinds, they usually consist of ascending or descending currents, the\r\nformer capable of suspending such small and light objects as are many\r\nseeds long enough for them to be carried enormous distances. For each\r\nsingle seed carried away by external attachment to the feet or feathers\r\nof a bird, countless millions are probably carried away by violent\r\nwinds; and the chance of conveyance to a great distance and in a\r\ndefinite direction must be many times greater by the latter mode than\r\nby the former.[182] We have seen that inorganic particles of much\r\ngreater specific gravity than seeds, and nearly as heavy as the smallest\r\nkinds, are carried to great distances through the air, and we can\r\ntherefore hardly doubt that some seeds are carried as far. The direct\r\nagency of the wind, as a supplement to bird-transport, will help to\r\nexplain the presence in oceanic islands of plants growing in dry or\r\nrocky places whose small seeds are not likely to become attached to\r\nbirds; while it seems to be the only effective agency possible in the\r\ndispersal of those species of alpine or sub-alpine plants found on the\r\nsummits of distant mountains, or still more widely separated in the\r\ntemperate zones of the northern and southern hemispheres.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Concluding Remarks._\r\n\r\nOn the general principles that have been now laid down, it will be found\r\nthat all the chief facts of the geographical distribution of animals and\r\nplants can be sufficiently understood. There will, of course, be many\r\ncases of difficulty and some seeming anomalies, but these can usually be\r\nseen to depend on our ignorance of some of the essential factors of the\r\nproblem. Either we do not know the distribution of the group in recent\r\ngeological times, or we are still ignorant of the special methods by\r\nwhich the organisms are able to cross the sea. The latter difficulty\r\napplies especially to the lizard tribe, which are found in almost all\r\nthe tropical oceanic islands; but the particular mode in which they are\r\nable to traverse a wide expanse of ocean, which is a perfect barrier to\r\nbatrachia and almost so to snakes, has not yet been discovered. Lizards\r\nare found in all the larger Pacific Islands as far as Tahiti, while\r\nsnakes do not extend beyond the Fiji Islands; and the latter are also\r\nabsent from Mauritius and Bourbon, where lizards of seven or eight\r\nspecies abound. Naturalists resident in the Pacific Islands would make a\r\nvaluable contribution to our science by studying the life-history of the\r\nnative lizards, and endeavouring to ascertain the special facilities\r\nthey possess for crossing over wide spaces of ocean.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 163: See A.

The letter is dated \"Shanghai, 1st May 1856,\"\r\nand the passage referred to is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For the past three days we have had very warm weather for this time of\r\nyear, in fact almost as warm as the middle of summer. Last evening the\r\nwind suddenly changed round to the north and blew all night with\r\nconsiderable violence, making a great change in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\"This morning, myriads of small white particles are floating about in\r\nthe air; there is not a single cloud and no mist, yet the sun is quite\r\nobscured by this substance, and it looks like a white fog in England. I\r\nenclose thee a sample, thinking it may interest. It is evidently a\r\nvegetable production; I think, apparently, some kind of seed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Hemsley adds, that this substance proves to be the plumose seeds of\r\na poplar or willow. In order to produce the effects described--_quite\r\nobscuring the sun like a white fog_,--the seeds must have filled the air\r\nto a very great height; and they must have been brought from some\r\ndistrict where there were extensive tracts covered with the tree which\r\nproduced them.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE GEOLOGICAL EVIDENCES OF EVOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\n    What we may expect--The number of known species of extinct\r\n    animals--Causes of the imperfection of the geological\r\n    record--Geological evidences of\r\n    evolution--Shells--Crocodiles--The rhinoceros tribe--The\r\n    pedigree of the horse tribe--Development of deer's horns--Brain\r\n    development--Local relations of fossil and living animals--Cause\r\n    of extinction of large animals--Indications of general progress\r\n    in plants and animals--The progressive development of\r\n    plants--Possible cause of sudden late appearance of\r\n    exogens--Geological distribution of insects--Geological\r\n    succession of vertebrata--Concluding remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe theory of evolution in the organic world necessarily implies that\r\nthe forms of animals and plants have, broadly speaking, progressed from\r\na more generalised to a more specialised structure, and from simpler to\r\nmore complex forms. We know, however, that this progression has been by\r\nno means regular, but has been accompanied by repeated degradation and\r\ndegeneration; while extinction on an enormous scale has again and again\r\nstopped all progress in certain directions, and has often compelled a\r\nfresh start in development from some comparatively low and imperfect\r\ntype.\r\n\r\nThe enormous extension of geological research in recent times has made\r\nus acquainted with a vast number of extinct organisms, so vast that in\r\nsome important groups--such as the mollusca--the fossil are more\r\nnumerous than the living species; while in the mammalia they are not\r\nmuch less numerous, the preponderance of living species being chiefly in\r\nthe smaller and in the arboreal forms which have not been so well\r\npreserved as the members of the larger groups. With such a wealth of\r\nmaterial to illustrate the successive stages through which animals have\r\npassed, it will naturally be expected that we should find important\r\nevidence of evolution. We should hope to learn the steps by which some\r\nisolated forms have been connected with their nearest allies, and in\r\nmany cases to have the gaps filled up which now separate genus from\r\ngenus, or species from species. In some cases these expectations are\r\nfulfilled, but in many other cases we seek in vain for evidence of the\r\nkind we desire; and this absence of evidence with such an apparent\r\nwealth of material is held by many persons to throw doubt on the theory\r\nof evolution itself. They urge, with much appearance of reason, that all\r\nthe arguments we have hitherto adduced fall short of demonstration, and\r\nthat the crucial test consists in being able to show, in a great number\r\nof cases, those connecting links which we say must have existed. Many of\r\nthe gaps that still remain are so vast that it seems incredible to these\r\nwriters that they could ever have been filled up by a close succession\r\nof species, since these must have spread over so many ages, and have\r\nexisted in such numbers, that it seems impossible to account for their\r\ntotal absence from deposits in which great numbers of species belonging\r\nto other groups are preserved and have been discovered. In order to\r\nappreciate the force, or weakness, of these objections, we must inquire\r\ninto the character and completeness of that record of the past life of\r\nthe earth which geology has unfolded, and ascertain the nature and\r\namount of the evidence which, under actual conditions, we may expect to\r\nfind.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Number of known Species of Extinct Animals._\r\n\r\nWhen we state that the known fossil mollusca are considerably more\r\nnumerous than those which now live on the earth, it appears at first\r\nsight that our knowledge is very complete, but this is far from being\r\nthe case. The species have been continually changing throughout\r\ngeological time, and at each period have probably been as numerous as\r\nthey are now. If we divide the fossiliferous strata into twelve great\r\ndivisions--the Pliocene, Miocene, Eocene, Cretaceous, Oolite, Lias,\r\nTrias, Permian, Carboniferous, Devonian, Silurian, and Cambrian,--we\r\nfind not only that each has a very distinct and characteristic molluscan\r\nfauna, but that the different subdivisions often present a widely\r\ndifferent series of species; so that although a certain number of\r\nspecies are common to two or more of the great divisions, the totality\r\nof the species that have lived upon the earth must be very much more\r\nthan twelve times--perhaps even thirty or forty times--the number now\r\nliving. In like manner, although the species of fossil mammals now\r\nrecognised by more or less fragmentary fossil remains may not be much\r\nless numerous than the living species, yet the duration of existence of\r\nthese was comparatively so short that they were almost completely\r\nchanged, perhaps six or seven times, during the Tertiary period; and\r\nthis is certainly only a fragment of the geological time during which\r\nmammalia existed on the globe.\r\n\r\nThere is also reason to believe that the higher animals were much more\r\nabundant in species during past geological epochs than now, owing to the\r\ngreater equability of the climate which rendered even the arctic regions\r\nas habitable as the temperate zones are in our time.\r\n\r\nThe same equable climate would probably cause a more uniform\r\ndistribution of moisture, and render what are now desert regions capable\r\nof supporting abundance of animal life. This is indicated by the number\r\nand variety of the species of large animals that have been found fossil\r\nin very limited areas which they evidently inhabited at one period. M.\r\nAlbert Gaudry found, in the deposits of a mountain stream at Pikermi in\r\nGreece, an abundance of large mammalia such as are nowhere to be found\r\nliving together at the present time. Among them were two species of\r\nMastodon, two different rhinoceroses, a gigantic wild boar, a camel and\r\na giraffe larger than those now living, several monkeys, carnivora\r\nranging from martens and civets to lions and hyaenas of the largest\r\nsize, numerous antelopes of at least five distinct genera, and besides\r\nthese many forms altogether extinct. Such were the great herds of\r\nHipparion, an ancestral form of horse; the Helladotherium, a huge animal\r\nbigger than the giraffe; the Ancylotherium, one of the Edentata; the\r\nhuge Dinotherium; the Aceratherium, allied to the rhinoceros; and the\r\nmonstrous Chalicotherium, allied to the swine and ruminants, but as\r\nlarge as a rhinoceros; and to prey upon these, the great Machairodus or\r\nsabre-toothed tiger. And all these remains were found in a space 300\r\npaces long by 60 paces broad, many of the species existing in enormous\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\nThe Pikermi fossils belong to the Upper Miocene formation, but an\r\nequally rich deposit of Upper Eocene age has been discovered in\r\nSouth-Western France at Quercy, where M. Filhol has determined the\r\npresence of no less than forty-two species of beasts of prey alone.\r\nEqually remarkable are the various discoveries of mammalian fossils in\r\nNorth America, especially in the old lake bottoms now forming what are\r\ncalled the \"bad lands\" of Dakota and Nebraska, belonging to the Miocene\r\nperiod. Here are found an enormous assemblage of remains, often perfect\r\nskeletons, of herbivora and carnivora, as varied and interesting as\r\nthose from the localities already referred to in Europe; but altogether\r\ndistinct, and far exceeding, in number and variety of species of the\r\nlarger animals, the whole existing fauna of North America. Very similar\r\nphenomena occur in South America and in Australia, leading us to the\r\nconclusion that the earth at the present time is impoverished as regards\r\nthe larger animals, and that at each successive period of Tertiary time,\r\nat all events, it contained a far greater number of species than now\r\ninhabit it. The very richness and abundance of the remains which we find\r\nin limited areas, serve to convince us how imperfect and fragmentary\r\nmust be our knowledge of the earth's fauna at any one past epoch; since\r\nwe cannot believe that all, or nearly all, of the animals which\r\ninhabited any district were entombed in a single lake, or overwhelmed by\r\nthe floods of a single river.\r\n\r\nBut the spots where such rich deposits occur are exceedingly few and far\r\nbetween when compared with the vast areas of continental land, and we\r\nhave every reason to believe that in past ages, as now, numbers of\r\ncurious species were rare or local, the commoner and more abundant\r\nspecies giving a very imperfect idea of the existing series of animal\r\nforms. Yet more important, as showing the imperfection of our knowledge,\r\nis the enormous lapse of time between the several formations in which we\r\nfind organic remains in any abundance, so vast that in many cases we\r\nfind ourselves almost in a new world, all the species and most of the\r\ngenera of the higher animals having undergone a complete change.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Causes of the Imperfection of the Geological Record._\r\n\r\nThese facts are quite in accordance with the conclusions of geologists\r\nas to the necessary imperfection of the geological record, since it\r\nrequires the concurrence of a number of favourable conditions to\r\npreserve any adequate representation of the life of a given epoch. In\r\nthe first place, the animals to be preserved must not die a natural\r\ndeath by disease, or old age, or by being the prey of other animals, but\r\nmust be destroyed by some accident which shall lead to their being\r\nembedded in the soil. They must be either carried away by floods, sink\r\ninto bogs or quicksands, or be enveloped in the mud or ashes of a\r\nvolcanic eruption; and when thus embedded they must remain undisturbed\r\namid all the future changes of the earth's surface.\r\n\r\nBut the chances against this are enormous, because denudation is always\r\ngoing on, and the rocks we now find at the earth's surface are only a\r\nsmall fragment of those which were originally laid down. The\r\nalternations of marine and freshwater deposits, and the frequent\r\nunconformability of strata with those which overlie them, tell us\r\nplainly of repeated elevations and depressions of the surface, and of\r\ndenudation on an enormous scale. Almost every mountain range, with its\r\npeaks, ridges, and valleys, is but the remnant of some vast plateau\r\neaten away by sub-aerial agencies; every range of sea-cliffs tell us of\r\nlong slopes of land destroyed by the waves; while almost all the older\r\nrocks which now form the surface of the earth have been once covered\r\nwith newer deposits which have long since disappeared. Nowhere are the\r\nevidences of this denudation more apparent than in North and South\r\nAmerica, where granitic or metamorphic rocks cover an area hardly less\r\nthan that of all Europe. The same rocks are largely developed in Central\r\nAfrica and Eastern Asia; while, besides those portions that appear\r\nexposed on the surface, areas of unknown extent are buried under strata\r\nwhich rest on them uncomformably, and could not, therefore, constitute\r\nthe original capping under which the whole of these rocks must once have\r\nbeen deeply buried; because granite can only be formed, and metamorphism\r\ncan only go on, deep down in the crust of the earth. What an\r\noverwhelming idea does this give us of the destruction of whole piles\r\nof rock, miles in thickness and covering areas comparable with those of\r\ncontinents; and how great must have been the loss of the innumerable\r\nfossil forms which those rocks contained! In view of such destruction we\r\nare forced to conclude that our palaeontological collections, rich\r\nthough they may appear, are really but small and random samples, giving\r\nno adequate idea of the mighty series of organism which have lived upon\r\nthe earth.[183]\r\n\r\nAdmitting, however, the extreme imperfection of the geological record as\r\na whole, it may be urged that certain limited portions of it are fairly\r\ncomplete--as, for example, the various Miocene deposits of India,\r\nEurope, and North America,--and that in these we ought to find many\r\nexamples of species and genera linked together by intermediate forms. It\r\nmay be replied that in several cases this really occurs; and the reason\r\nwhy it does not occur more often is, that the theory of evolution\r\nrequires that distinct genera should be linked together, not by a direct\r\npassage, but by the descent of both from a common ancestor, which may\r\nhave lived in some much earlier age the record of which is either\r\nwanting or very incomplete. An illustration given by Mr. Darwin will\r\nmake this more clear to those who have not studied the subject. The\r\nfantail and pouter pigeons are two very distinct and unlike breeds,\r\nwhich we yet know to have been both derived from the common wild\r\nrock-pigeon. Now, if we had every variety of living pigeon before us, or\r\neven all those which have lived during the present century, we should\r\nfind no intermediate types between these two--none combining in any\r\ndegree the characters of the pouter with that of the fantail. Neither\r\nshould we ever find such an intermediate form, even had there been\r\npreserved a specimen of every breed of pigeon since the ancestral\r\nrock-pigeon was first tamed by man--a period of probably several\r\nthousand years. We thus see that a complete passage from one very\r\ndistinct species to another could not be expected even had we a complete\r\nrecord of the life of any one period. What we require is a complete\r\nrecord of all the species that have existed since the two forms began\r\nto diverge from their common ancestor, and this the known imperfection\r\nof the record renders it almost impossible that we should ever attain.\r\nAll that we have a right to expect is, that, as we multiply the fossil\r\nforms in any group, the gaps that at first existed in that group shall\r\nbecome less wide and less numerous; and also that, in some cases, a\r\ntolerably direct series shall be found, by which the more specialised\r\nforms of the present day shall be connected with more generalised\r\nancestral types. We might also expect that when a country is now\r\ncharacterised by special groups of animals, the fossil forms that\r\nimmediately preceded them shall, for the most part, belong to the same\r\ngroups; and further, that, comparing the more ancient with the more\r\nmodern types, we should find indications of progression, the earlier\r\nforms being, on the whole, lower in organisation, and less specialised\r\nin structure than the later. Now evidence of evolution of these varied\r\nkinds is what we do find, and almost every fresh discovery adds to their\r\nnumber and cogency. In order, therefore, to show that the testimony\r\ngiven by geology is entirely in favour of the theory of descent with\r\nmodification, some of the more striking of the facts will now be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geological Evidences of Evolution._\r\n\r\nIn an article in _Nature_ (vol. xiv. p. 275), Professor Judd calls\r\nattention to some recent discoveries in the Hungarian plains, of fossil\r\nlacustrine shells, and their careful study by Dr. Neumayr and M. Paul of\r\nthe Austrian Geological Survey. The beds in which they occur have\r\naccumulated to the thickness of 2000 feet, containing throughout\r\nabundance of fossils, and divisible into eight zones, each of which\r\nexhibits a well-marked and characteristic fauna. Professor Judd then\r\ndescribes the bearing of these discoveries as follows--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The group of shells which affords the most interesting evidence\r\n    of the origin of new forms through descent with modification is\r\n    that of the genus Vivipara or Paludina, which occurs in\r\n    prodigious abundance throughout the whole series of freshwater\r\n    strata. We shall not, of course, attempt in this place to enter\r\n    into any details concerning the forty distinct _forms_ of this\r\n    genus (Dr. Neumayr very properly hesitates to call them all\r\n    _species_), which are named and described in this monograph,\r\n    and between which, as the authors show, so many connecting\r\n    links, clearly illustrating the derivation of the newer from the\r\n    older types, have been detected. On the minds of those who\r\n    carefully examine the admirably engraved figures given in the\r\n    plates accompanying this valuable memoir, or still better, the\r\n    very large series of specimens from among which the subjects of\r\n    these figures are selected, and which are now in the museum of\r\n    the Reichsanstalt of Vienna, but little doubt will, we suspect,\r\n    remain that the authors have fully made out their case, and have\r\n    demonstrated that, beyond all controversy, the series with\r\n    highly complicated ornamentation were variously derived by\r\n    descent--the lines of which are in most cases perfectly clear\r\n    and obvious--from the simple and unornamented Vivipara\r\n    achatinoides of the Congerien-Schichten (the lower division of\r\n    the series of strata). It is interesting to notice that a large\r\n    portion of these unquestionably derived forms depart so widely\r\n    from the type of the genus Vivipara, that they have been\r\n    separated on so high an authority as that of Sandberger, as a\r\n    new genus, under the name of Tulotoma. And hence we are led to\r\n    the conclusion that a vast number of forms, certainly exhibiting\r\n    specific distinctions, and according to some naturalists,\r\n    differences even entitled to be regarded of generic value, have\r\n    all a common ancestry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is, as Professor Judd remarks, owing to the exceptionally favourable\r\ncircumstances of a long-continued and unbroken series of deposits being\r\nformed under physical conditions either identical or very slowly\r\nchanging, that we owe so complete a record of the process of organic\r\nchange. Usually, some disturbing elements, such as a sudden change of\r\nphysical conditions, or the immigration of new sets of forms from other\r\nareas and the consequent retreat or partial extinction of the older\r\nfauna, interferes with the continuity of organic development, and\r\nproduces those puzzling discordances so generally met with in geological\r\nformations of marine origin. While a case of the kind now described\r\naffords evidence of the origin of species complete and conclusive,\r\nthough on a necessarily very limited scale, the very rarity of the\r\nconditions which are essential to such completeness serves to explain\r\nwhy it is that in most cases the direct evidence of evolution is not to\r\nbe obtained.\r\n\r\nAnother illustration of the filling up of gaps between existing groups\r\nis afforded by Professor Huxley's researches on fossil crocodiles. The\r\ngap between the existing crocodiles and the lizards is very wide, but as\r\nwe go back in geological time we meet with fossil forms which are to\r\nsome extent intermediate and form a connected series. The three living\r\ngenera--Crocodilus, Alligator, and Gavialis--are found in the Eocene\r\nformation, and allied forms of another genus, Holops, in the Chalk. From\r\nthe Chalk backward to the Lias another group of genera occurs, having\r\nanatomical characteristics intermediate between the living crocodiles\r\nand the most ancient forms. These, forming two genera Belodon and\r\nStagonolepis, are found in a still older formation, the Trias. They have\r\ncharacters resembling some lizards, especially the remarkable Hatteria\r\nof New Zealand, and have also some resemblances to the\r\nDinosaurians--reptiles which in some respects approach birds.\r\nConsidering how comparatively few are the remains of this group of\r\nanimals, the evidence which it affords of progressive development is\r\nremarkably clear.[184]\r\n\r\nAmong the higher animals the rhinoceros, the horse, and the deer afford\r\ngood evidence of advance in organisation and of the filling up of the\r\ngaps which separate the living forms from their nearest allies. The\r\nearliest ancestral forms of the rhinoceroses occur in the Middle Eocene\r\nof the United States, and were to some extent intermediate between the\r\nrhinoceros and tapir families, having like the latter four toes to the\r\nfront feet, and three to those behind. These are followed in the Upper\r\nEocene by the genus Amynodon, in which the skull assumes more distinctly\r\nthe rhinocerotic type. Following this in the Lower Miocene we have the\r\nAceratherium, like the last in its feet, but still more decidedly a\r\nrhinoceros in its general structure. From this there are two diverging\r\nlines--one in the Old World, the other in the New. In the former, to\r\nwhich the Aceratherium is supposed to have migrated in early Miocene\r\ntimes, when a mild climate and luxuriant vegetation prevailed far within\r\nthe arctic circle, it gave rise to the Ceratorhinus and the various\r\nhorned rhinoceroses of late Tertiary times and of those now living. In\r\nAmerica a number of large hornless rhinoceroses were developed--they\r\nare found in the Upper Miocene, Pliocene, and Post-Pliocene\r\nformations--and then became extinct. The true rhinoceroses have three\r\ntoes on all the feet.[185]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Pedigree of the Horse Tribe._\r\n\r\nYet more remarkable is the evidence afforded by the ancestral forms of\r\nthe horse tribe which have been discovered in the American tertiaries.\r\nThe family Equidae, comprising the living horse, asses, and zebras,\r\ndiffer widely from all other mammals in the peculiar structure of the\r\nfeet, all of which terminate in a single large toe forming the hoof.\r\nThey have forty teeth, the molars being formed of hard and soft material\r\nin crescentic folds, so as to be a powerful agent in grinding up hard\r\ngrasses and other vegetable food. The former peculiarities depend upon\r\nmodifications of the skeleton, which have been thus described by\r\nProfessor Huxley:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Let us turn in the first place to the fore-limb. In most\r\n    quadrupeds, as in ourselves, the fore-arm contains distinct\r\n    bones, called the radius and the ulna. The corresponding region\r\n    in the horse seems at first to possess but one bone. Careful\r\n    observation, however, enables us to distinguish in this bone a\r\n    part which clearly answers to the upper end of the ulna. This is\r\n    closely united with the chief mass of the bone which represents\r\n    the radius, and runs out into a slender shaft, which may be\r\n    traced for some distance downwards upon the back of the radius,\r\n    and then in most cases thins out and vanishes. It takes still\r\n    more trouble to make sure of what is nevertheless the fact, that\r\n    a small part of the lower end of the bone of a horse's fore-arm,\r\n    which is only distinct in a very young foal, is really the lower\r\n    extremity of the ulna.\r\n\r\n    \"What is commonly called the knee of a horse is its wrist. The\r\n    'cannon bone' answers to the middle bone of the five metacarpal\r\n    bones which support the palm of the hand in ourselves. The\r\n    pastern, coronary, and coffin bones of veterinarians answer to\r\n    the joints of our middle fingers, while the hoof is simply a\r\n    greatly enlarged and thickened nail. But if what lies below the\r\n    horse's 'knee' thus corresponds to the middle finger in\r\n    ourselves, what has become of the four other fingers or digits?\r\n    We find in the places of the second and fourth digits only two\r\n    slender splintlike bones, about two-thirds as long as the cannon\r\n    bone, which gradually taper to their lower ends and bear no\r\n    finger joints, or, as they are termed, phalanges. Sometimes,\r\n    small bony or gristly nodules are to be found at the bases of\r\n    these two metacarpal splints, and it is probable that these\r\n    represent rudiments of the first and fifth toes. Thus, the part\r\n    of the horse's skeleton which corresponds with that of the human\r\n    hand, contains one overgrown middle digit, and at least two\r\n    imperfect lateral digits; and these answer, respectively, to the\r\n    third, the second, and the fourth fingers in man.\r\n\r\n    \"Corresponding modifications are found in the hind limb. In\r\n    ourselves, and in most quadrupeds, the leg contains two distinct\r\n    bones, a large bone, the tibia, and a smaller and more slender\r\n    bone, the fibula. But, in the horse, the fibula seems, at first,\r\n    to be reduced to its upper end; a short slender bone united with\r\n    the tibia, and ending in a point below, occupying its place.\r\n    Examination of the lower end of a young foal's shin-bone,\r\n    however, shows a distinct portion of osseous matter which is the\r\n    lower end of the fibula; so that the, apparently single, lower\r\n    end of the shin-bone is really made up of the coalesced ends of\r\n    the tibia and fibula, just as the, apparently single, lower end\r\n    of the fore-arm bone is composed of the coalesced radius and\r\n    ulna.\r\n\r\n    \"The heel of the horse is the part commonly known as the hock.\r\n    The hinder cannon bone answers to the middle metatarsal bone of\r\n    the human foot, the pastern, coronary, and coffin bones, to the\r\n    middle toe bones; the hind hoof to the nail; as in the forefoot.\r\n    And, as in the forefoot, there are merely two splints to\r\n    represent the second and the fourth toes. Sometimes a rudiment\r\n    of a fifth toe appears to be traceable.\r\n\r\n    \"The teeth of a horse are not less peculiar than its limbs. The\r\n    living engine, like all others, must be well stoked if it is to\r\n    do its work; and the horse, if it is to make good its wear and\r\n    tear, and to exert the enormous amount of force required for its\r\n    propulsion, must be well and rapidly fed. To this end, good\r\n    cutting instruments and powerful and lasting crushers are\r\n    needful. Accordingly, the twelve cutting teeth of a horse are\r\n    close-set and concentrated in the forepart of its mouth, like so\r\n    many adzes or chisels. The grinders or molars are large, and\r\n    have an extremely complicated structure, being composed of a\r\n    number of different substances of unequal hardness. The\r\n    consequence of this is that they wear away at different rates;\r\n    and, hence, the surface of each grinder is always as uneven as\r\n    that of a good millstone.\"[186]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe thus see that the Equidae differ very widely in structure from most\r\nother mammals. Assuming the truth of the theory of evolution, we should\r\nexpect to find traces among extinct animals of the steps by which this\r\ngreat modification has been effected; and we do really find traces of\r\nthese steps, imperfectly among European fossils, but far more completely\r\namong those of America.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact that, although no horse inhabited America when\r\ndiscovered by Europeans, yet abundance of remains of extinct horses have\r\nbeen found both in North and South America in Post-Tertiary and Upper\r\nPliocene deposits; and from these an almost continuous series of\r\nmodified forms can be traced in the Tertiary formation, till we reach,\r\nat the very base of the series, a primitive form so unlike our perfected\r\nanimal, that, had we not the intermediate links, few persons would\r\nbelieve that the one was the ancestor of the other. The tracing out of\r\nthis marvellous history we owe chiefly to Professor Marsh of Yale\r\nCollege, who has himself discovered no less than thirty species of\r\nfossil Equidae; and we will allow him to tell the story of the\r\ndevelopment of the horse from a humble progenitor in his own words.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The oldest representative of the horse at present known is the\r\n    diminutive Eohippus from the Lower Eocene. Several species have\r\n    been found, all about the size of a fox. Like most of the early\r\n    mammals, these ungulates had forty-four teeth, the molars with\r\n    short crowns and quite distinct in form from the premolars. The\r\n    ulna and fibula were entire and distinct, and there were four\r\n    well-developed toes and a rudiment of another on the forefeet,\r\n    and three toes behind. In the structure of the feet and teeth,\r\n    the Eohippus unmistakably indicates that the direct ancestral\r\n    line to the modern horse has already separated from the other\r\n    perissodactyles, or odd-toed ungulates.\r\n\r\n    \"In the next higher division of the Eocene another genus,\r\n    Orohippus, makes its appearance, replacing Eohippus, and showing\r\n    a greater, though still distant, resemblance to the equine type.\r\n    The rudimentary first digit of the forefoot has disappeared, and\r\n    the last premolar has gone over to the molar series. Orohippus\r\n    was but little larger than Eohippus, and in most other respects\r\n    very similar. Several species have been found, but none occur\r\n    later than the Upper Eocene.\r\n\r\n    \"Near the base of the Miocene, we find a third closely allied\r\n    genus, Mesohippus, which is about as large as a sheep, and one\r\n    stage nearer the horse. There are only three toes and a\r\n    rudimentary splint on the forefeet, and three toes behind. Two\r\n    of the premolar teeth are quite like the molars. The ulna is no\r\n    longer distinct or the fibula entire, and other characters show\r\n    clearly that the transition is advancing.\r\n\r\n    \"In the Upper Miocene Mesohippus is not found, but in its place\r\n    a fourth form, Miohippus, continues the line. This genus is near\r\n    the Anchitherium of Europe, but presents several important\r\n    differences. The three toes in each foot are more nearly of a\r\n    size, and a rudiment of the fifth metacarpal bone is retained.\r\n    All the known species of this genus are larger than those of\r\n    Mesohippus, and none of them pass above the Miocene formation.\r\n\r\n    \"The genus Protohippus of the Lower Pliocene is yet more equine,\r\n    and some of its species equalled the ass in size. There are\r\n    still three toes on each foot, but only the middle one,\r\n    corresponding to the single toe of the horse, comes to the\r\n    ground. This genus resembles most nearly the Hipparion of\r\n    Europe.\r\n\r\n    \"In the Pliocene we have the last stage of the series before\r\n    reaching the horse, in the genus Pliohippus, which has lost the\r\n    small hooflets, and in other respects is very equine. Only in\r\n    the Upper Pliocene does the true Equus appear and complete the\r\n    genealogy of the horse, which in the Post-Tertiary roamed over\r\n    the whole of North and South America, and soon after became\r\n    extinct. This occurred long before the discovery of the\r\n    continent by Europeans, and no satisfactory reason for the\r\n    extinction has yet been given. Besides the characters I have\r\n    mentioned, there are many others in the skeleton, skull, teeth,\r\n    and brain of the forty or more intermediate species, which show\r\n    that the transition from the Eocene Eohippus to the modern Equus\r\n    has taken place in the order indicated\"[187] (see Fig. 33).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--Geological development of the horse tribe\r\n(Eohippus since discovered).]\r\n\r\nWell may Professor Huxley say that this is demonstrative evidence of\r\nevolution; the doctrine resting upon exactly as secure a foundation as\r\ndid the Copernican theory of the motions of the heavenly bodies at the\r\ntime of its promulgation. Both have the same basis--the coincidence of\r\nthe observed facts with the theoretical requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Development of Deer's Horns._\r\n\r\nAnother clear and unmistakable proof of evolution is afforded by one of\r\nthe highest and latest developed tribes of mammals--the true deer. These\r\ndiffer from all other ruminants in possessing solid deciduous horns\r\nwhich are always more or less branched. They first appear in the Middle\r\nMiocene formation, and continue down to our time; and their development\r\nhas been carefully traced by Professor Boyd Dawkins, who thus summarises\r\nhis results:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"In the middle stage of the Miocene the cervine antler consists\r\n    merely of a simple forked crown (as in Cervus dicroceros), which\r\n    increases in size in the Upper Miocene, although it still\r\n    remains small and erect, like that of the roe. In Cervus\r\n    Matheroni it measures 11·4 inches, and throws off not more than\r\n    four tines, all small. The deer living in Auvergne in the\r\n    succeeding or Pliocene age, present us with another stage in the\r\n    history of antler development. There, for the first time, we see\r\n    antlers of the Axis and Rusa type, larger and longer, and more\r\n    branching than any antlers were before, and possessing three or\r\n    more well-developed tines. Deer of this type abounded in\r\n    Pliocene Europe. They belong to the Oriental division of the\r\n    Cervidae, and their presence in Europe confirms the evidence of\r\n    the flora, brought forward by the Comte de Saporta, that the\r\n    Pliocene climate was warm. They have probably disappeared from\r\n    Europe in consequence of the lowering of the temperature in the\r\n    Pleistocene age, while their descendants have found a congenial\r\n    home in the warmer regions of Eastern Asia.\r\n\r\n    \"In the latest stage of the Pliocene--the Upper Pliocene of the\r\n    Val d'Arno--the Cervus dicranios of Nesti presents us with\r\n    antlers much smaller than those of the Irish elk, but very\r\n    complicated in their branching. This animal survived into the\r\n    succeeding age, and is found in the pre-glacial forest bed of\r\n    Norfolk, being described by Dr. Falconer under the name of\r\n    Sedgwick's deer. The Irish elk, moose, stag, reindeer, and\r\n    fallow deer appear in Europe in the Pleistocene age, all with\r\n    highly complicated antlers in the adult, and the first\r\n    possessing the largest antlers yet known. Of these the Irish elk\r\n    disappeared in the Prehistoric age, after having lived in\r\n    countless herds in Ireland, while the rest have lived on into\r\n    our own times in Euro-Asia, and, with the exception of the last,\r\n    also in North America.\r\n\r\n    \"From this survey it is obvious that the cervine antlers have\r\n    increased in size and complexity from the Mid-Miocene to the\r\n    Pleistocene age, and that their successive changes are analogous\r\n    to those which are observed in the development of antlers in the\r\n    living deer, which begin with a simple point, and increase in\r\n    number of tines till their limit of growth be reached. In other\r\n    words, the development of antlers indicated at successive and\r\n    widely-separated pages of the geological record is the same as\r\n    that observed in the history of a single living species. It is\r\n    also obvious that the progressive diminution of size and\r\n    complexity in the antlers, from the present time back into the\r\n    early Tertiary age, shows that we are approaching the zero of\r\n    antler development in the Mid-Miocene. No trace of any\r\n    antler-bearing ruminant has been met with in the lower Miocenes,\r\n    either of Europe or the United States.\"[188]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Progressive Brain-Development._\r\n\r\nThe three illustrations now given sufficiently prove that, whenever the\r\ngeological record approaches to completeness, we have evidence of the\r\nprogressive change of species in definite directions, and from less\r\ndeveloped to more developed types--exactly such a change as we may\r\nexpect to find if the evolution theory be the true one. Many other\r\nillustrations of a similar change could be given, but the animal groups\r\nin which they occur being less familiar, the details would be less\r\ninteresting, and perhaps hardly intelligible. There is, however, one\r\nvery remarkable proof of development that must be briefly noticed--that\r\nafforded by the steady increase in the size of the brain. This may be\r\nbest stated in the words of Professor Marsh:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The real progress of mammalian life in America, from the\r\n    beginning of the Tertiary to the present, is well illustrated by\r\n    the brain-growth, in which we have the key to many other\r\n    changes. The earliest known Tertiary mammals all had very small\r\n    brains, and in some forms this organ was proportionally less\r\n    than in certain reptiles. There was a gradual increase in the\r\n    size of the brain during this period, and it is interesting to\r\n    find that this growth was mainly confined to the cerebral\r\n    hemispheres, or higher portion of the brain. In most groups of\r\n    mammals the brain has gradually become more convoluted, and thus\r\n    increased in quality as well as quantity. In some also the\r\n    cerebellum and olfactory lobes, the lower parts of the brain,\r\n    have even diminished in size. In the long struggle for existence\r\n    during Tertiary time the big brains won, then as now; and the\r\n    increasing power thus gained rendered useless many structures\r\n    inherited from primitive ancestors, but no longer adapted to new\r\n    conditions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis remarkable proof of development in the organ of the mental\r\nfaculties, forms a fitting climax to the evidence already adduced of the\r\nprogressive evolution of the general structure of the body, as\r\nillustrated by the bony skeleton. We now pass on to another class of\r\nfacts equally suggestive of evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Local Relations of Fossil and Living Animals._\r\n\r\nIf all existing animals have been produced from ancestral forms--mostly\r\nextinct--under the law of variation and natural selection, we may expect\r\nto find in most cases a close relation between the living forms of each\r\ncountry and those which inhabited it in the immediately preceding epoch.\r\nBut if species have originated in some quite different way, either by\r\nany kind of special creation, or by sudden advances of organisation in\r\nthe offspring of preceding types, such close relationship would not be\r\nfound; and facts of this kind become, therefore, to some extent a test\r\nof evolution under natural selection or some other law of gradual\r\nchange. Of course the relationship will not appear when extensive\r\nmigration has occurred, by which the inhabitants of one region have been\r\nable to take possession of another region, and destroy or drive out its\r\noriginal inhabitants, as has sometimes happened. But such cases are\r\ncomparatively rare, except where great changes of climate are known to\r\nhave occurred; and we usually do find a remarkable continuity between\r\nthe existing fauna and flora of a country and those of the immediately\r\npreceding age. A few of the more remarkable of these cases will now be\r\nbriefly noticed.\r\n\r\nThe mammalian fauna of Australia consists, as is well known, wholly of\r\nthe lowest forms--the Marsupials and Monotremata--except only a few\r\nspecies of mice. This is accounted for by the complete isolation of the\r\ncountry from the Asiatic continent during the whole period of the\r\ndevelopment of the higher animals. At some earlier epoch the ancestral\r\nmarsupials, which abounded both in Europe and North America in the\r\nmiddle of the Secondary period, entered the country, and have since\r\nremained there, free from the competition of higher forms, and have\r\nundergone a special development in accordance with the peculiar\r\nconditions of a limited area. While in the large continents higher forms\r\nof mammalia have been developed, which have almost or wholly\r\nexterminated the less perfect marsupials, in Australia these latter have\r\nbecome modified into such varied forms as the leaping kangaroos, the\r\nburrowing wombats, the arboreal phalangers, the insectivorous\r\nbandicoots, and the carnivorous Dasyuridae or native cats, culminating\r\nin the Thylacinus or \"tiger-wolf\" of Tasmania--animals as unlike each\r\nother as our sheep, rabbits, squirrels, and dogs, but all retaining the\r\ncharacteristic features of the marsupial type.\r\n\r\nNow in the caves and late Tertiary or Post-Tertiary deposits of\r\nAustralia the remains of many extinct mammalia have been found, but all\r\nare marsupials. There are many kangaroos, some larger than any living\r\nspecies, and others more allied to the tree-kangaroos of New Guinea; a\r\nlarge wombat as large as a tapir; the Diprotodon, a thick-limbed\r\nkangaroo the size of a rhinoceros or small elephant; and a quite\r\ndifferent animal, the Nototherium, nearly as large. The carnivorous\r\nThylacinus of Tasmania is also found fossil; and a huge phalanger,\r\nThylacoleo, the size of a lion, believed by Professor Owen and by\r\nProfessor Oscar Schmidt to have been equally carnivorous and\r\ndestructive.[189] Besides these, there are many other species more\r\nresembling the living forms both in size and structure, of which they\r\nmay be, in some cases, the direct ancestors. Two species of extinct\r\nEchidna, belonging to the very low Monotremata, have also been found in\r\nNew South Wales.\r\n\r\nNext to Australia, South America possesses the most remarkable\r\nassemblage of peculiar mammals, in its numerous Edentata--the sloths,\r\nant-eaters, and armadillos; its rodents, such as the cavies and\r\nchinchillas; its marsupial opossums, and its quadrumana of the family\r\nCebidae. Remains of extinct species of all these have been found in the\r\ncaves of Brazil, of Post-Pliocene age; while in the earlier Pliocene\r\ndeposits of the pampas many distinct genera of these groups have been\r\nfound, some of gigantic size and extraordinary form. There are\r\narmadillos of many types, some being as large as elephants; gigantic\r\nsloths of the genera Megatherium, Megalonyx, Mylodon, Lestodon, and many\r\nothers; rodents belonging to the American families Cavidae and\r\nChinchillidae; and ungulates allied to the llama; besides many other\r\nextinct forms of intermediate types or of uncertain affinities.[190] The\r\nextinct Moas of New Zealand--huge wingless birds allied to the living\r\nApteryx--illustrate the same general law.\r\n\r\nThe examples now quoted, besides illustrating and enforcing the general\r\nfact of evolution, throw some light on the usual character of the\r\nmodification and progression of animal forms. In the cases where the\r\ngeological record is tolerably complete, we find a continuous\r\ndevelopment of some kind--either in complexity of ornamentation, as in\r\nthe fossil Paludinas of the Hungarian lake-basins; in size and in the\r\nspecialisation of the feet and teeth, as in the American fossil horses;\r\nor in the increased development of the branching horns, as in the true\r\ndeer. In each of these cases specialisation and adaptation to the\r\nconditions of the environment appear to have reached their limits, and\r\nany change of these conditions, especially if it be at all rapid or\r\naccompanied by the competition of less developed but more adaptable\r\nforms, is liable to cause the extinction of the most highly developed\r\ngroups. Such we know was the case with the horse tribe in America, which\r\ntotally disappeared in that continent at an epoch so recent that we\r\ncannot be sure that the disappearance was not witnessed, perhaps caused,\r\nby man; while even in the Eastern hemisphere it is the smaller\r\nspecies--the asses and the zebras--that have persisted, while the larger\r\nand more highly developed true horses have almost, if not quite,\r\ndisappeared in a state of nature. So we find, both in Australia and\r\nSouth America, that in a quite recent period many of the largest and\r\nmost specialised forms have become extinct, while only the smaller types\r\nhave survived to our day; and a similar fact is to be observed in many\r\nof the earlier geological epochs, a group progressing and reaching a\r\nmaximum of size or complexity and then dying out, or leaving at most but\r\nfew and pigmy representatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cause of Extinction of Large Animals._\r\n\r\nNow there are several reasons for the repeated extinction of large\r\nrather than of small animals. In the first place, animals of great bulk\r\nrequire a proportionate supply of food, and any adverse change of\r\nconditions would affect them more seriously than it would smaller\r\nanimals. In the next place, the extreme specialisation of many of these\r\nlarge animals would render it less easy for them to be modified in any\r\nnew direction suited to changed conditions. Still more important,\r\nperhaps, is the fact that very large animals always increase slowly as\r\ncompared with small ones--the elephant producing a single young one\r\nevery three years, while a rabbit may have a litter of seven or eight\r\nyoung two or three times a year. Now the probability of favourable\r\nvariations will be in direct proportion to the population of the\r\nspecies, and as the smaller animals are not only many hundred times more\r\nnumerous than the largest, but also increase perhaps a hundred times as\r\nrapidly, they are able to become quickly modified by variation and\r\nnatural selection in harmony with changed conditions, while the large\r\nand bulky species, being unable to vary quickly enough, are obliged to\r\nsuccumb in the struggle for existence. As Professor Marsh well observes:\r\n\"In every vigorous primitive type which was destined to survive many\r\ngeological changes, there seems to have been a tendency to throw off\r\nlateral branches, which became highly specialised and soon died out,\r\nbecause they were unable to adapt themselves to new conditions.\" And he\r\ngoes on to show how the whole narrow path of the persistent Suilline\r\ntype, throughout the entire series of the American tertiaries, is\r\nstrewed with the remains of such ambitious offshoots, many of them\r\nattaining the size of a rhinoceros; \"while the typical pig, with an\r\nobstinacy never lost, has held on in spite of catastrophes and\r\nevolution, and still lives in America to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Indications of General Progression in Plants and Animals._\r\n\r\nOne of the most powerful arguments formerly adduced against evolution\r\nwas, that geology afforded no evidence of the gradual development of\r\norganic forms, but that whole tribes and classes appeared suddenly at\r\ndefinite epochs, and often in great variety and exhibiting a very\r\nperfect organisation. The mammalia, for example, were long thought to\r\nhave first appeared in Tertiary times, where they are represented in\r\nsome of the earlier deposits by all the great divisions of the class\r\nfully developed--carnivora, rodents, insectivora, marsupials, and even\r\nthe perissodactyle and artiodactyle divisions of the ungulata--as\r\nclearly defined as at the present day. The discovery in 1818 of a single\r\nlower jaw in the Stonesfield Slate of Oxfordshire hardly threw doubt on\r\nthe generalisation, since either its mammalian character was denied, or\r\nthe geological position of the strata, in which it was found, was held\r\nto have been erroneously determined. But since then, at intervals of\r\nmany years, other remains of mammalia have been discovered in the\r\nSecondary strata, ranging from the Upper Oolite to the Upper Trias both\r\nin Europe and the United States, and one even (Tritylodon) in the Trias\r\nof South Africa. All these are either marsupials, or of some still lower\r\ntype of mammalia; but they consist of many distinct forms classed in\r\nabout twenty genera. Nevertheless, a great gap still exists between\r\nthese mammals and those of the Tertiary strata, since no mammal of any\r\nkind has been found in any part of the Cretaceous formation, although in\r\nseveral of its subdivisions abundance of land plants, freshwater shells,\r\nand air-breathing reptiles have been discovered. So with fishes. In the\r\nlast century none had been obtained lower than the Carboniferous\r\nformation; thirty years later they were found to be very abundant in the\r\nDevonian rocks, and later still they were discovered in the Upper Ludlow\r\nand Lower Ludlow beds of the Silurian formation.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that such sudden appearances are deceptive, and are, in\r\nfact, only what we ought to expect from the known imperfection of the\r\ngeological record. The conditions favourable to the fossilisation of any\r\ngroup of animals occur comparatively rarely, and only in very limited\r\nareas; while the conditions essential for their permanent preservation\r\nin the rocks, amid all the destruction caused by denudation or\r\nmetamorphism, are still more exceptional. And when they are thus\r\npreserved to our day, the particular part of the rocks in which they lie\r\nhidden may not be on the surface but buried down deep under other\r\nstrata, and may thus, except in the case of mineral-bearing deposits, be\r\naltogether out of our reach. Then, again, how large a proportion of the\r\nearth consists of wild and uncivilised regions in which no exploration\r\nof the rocks has been yet made, so that whether we shall find the\r\nfossilised remains of any particular group of animals which lived during\r\na limited period of the earth's history, and in a limited area, depends\r\nupon at least a fivefold combination of chances. Now, if we take each of\r\nthese chances separately as only ten to one against us (and some are\r\ncertainly more than this), then the actual chance against our finding\r\nthe fossil remains, say of any one order of mammalia, or of land plants,\r\nat any particular geological horizon, will be about a hundred thousand\r\nto one.\r\n\r\nIt may be said, if the chances are so great, how is it that we find such\r\nimmense numbers of fossil species exceeding in number, in some groups,\r\nall those that are now living? But this is exactly what we should\r\nexpect, because the number of species of organisms that have ever lived\r\nupon the earth, since the earliest geological times, will probably be\r\nmany hundred times greater than those now existing of which we have any\r\nknowledge; and hence the enormous gaps and chasms in the geological\r\nrecord of extinct forms is not to be wondered at. Yet, notwithstanding\r\nthese chasms in our knowledge, if evolution is true, there ought to have\r\nbeen, on the whole, progression in all the chief types of life. The\r\nhigher and more specialised forms should have come into existence later\r\nthan the lower and more generalised forms; and however fragmentary the\r\nportions we possess of the whole tree of life upon the earth, they ought\r\nto show us broadly that such a progressive evolution has taken place. We\r\nhave seen that in some special groups, already referred to, such a\r\nprogression is clearly visible, and we will now cast a hasty glance over\r\nthe entire series of fossil forms, in order to see if a similar\r\nprogression is manifested by them as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Progressive Development of Plants._\r\n\r\nEver since fossil plants have been collected and studied, the broad fact\r\nhas been apparent that the early plants--those of the Coal\r\nformation--were mainly cryptogamous, while in the Tertiary deposits the\r\nhigher flowering plants prevailed. In the intermediate secondary epoch\r\nthe gymnosperms--cycads and coniferae--formed a prominent part of the\r\nvegetation, and as these have usually been held to be a kind of\r\ntransition form between the flowerless and flowering plants, the\r\ngeological succession has always, broadly speaking, been in accordance\r\nwith the theory of evolution. Beyond this, however, the facts were very\r\npuzzling. The highest cryptogams--ferns, lycopods, and\r\nequisetaceae--appeared suddenly, and in immense profusion in the Coal\r\nformation, at which period they attained a development they have never\r\nsince surpassed or even equalled; while the highest plants--the\r\ndicotyledonous and monocotyledonous angiosperms--which now form the bulk\r\nof the vegetation of the world, and exhibit the most wonderful\r\nmodifications of form and structure, were almost unknown till the\r\nTertiary period, when they suddenly appeared in full development, and,\r\nfor the most part, under the same generic forms as now exist.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter half of the present century, however, great additions\r\nhave been made to our knowledge of fossil plants; and although there\r\nare still indications of vast gaps in our knowledge, due, no doubt, to\r\nthe very exceptional conditions required for the preservation of plant\r\nremains, we now possess evidence of a more continuous development of the\r\nvarious types of vegetation. According to Mr. Lester F. Ward, between\r\n8000 and 9000 species of fossil plants have been described or indicated;\r\nand, owing to the careful study of the nervation of leaves, a large\r\nnumber of these are referable to their proper orders or genera, and\r\ntherefore give us some notion--which, though very imperfect, is probably\r\naccurate in its main outlines--of the progressive development of\r\nvegetation on the earth.[191] The following is a summary of the facts as\r\ngiven by Mr. Ward:--\r\n\r\nThe lowest forms of vegetable life--the cellular plants--have been found\r\nin Lower Silurian deposits in the form of three species of marine algae;\r\nand in the whole Silurian formation fifty species have been recognised.\r\nWe cannot for a moment suppose, however, that this indicates the first\r\nappearance of vegetable life upon the earth, for in these same Lower\r\nSilurian beds the more highly organised vascular cryptogams appear in\r\nthe form of rhizocarps--plants allied to Marsilea and Azolla,--and a\r\nvery little higher, ferns, lycopods, and even conifers appear. We have\r\nindications, however, of a still more ancient vegetation, in the\r\ncarbonaceous shales and thick beds of graphite far down in the Middle\r\nLaurentian, since there is no other known agency than the vegetable cell\r\nby means of which carbon can be extracted from the atmosphere and fixed\r\nin the solid state. These great beds of graphite, therefore, imply the\r\nexistence of abundance of vegetable life at the very commencement of the\r\nera of which we have any geological record.[192]\r\n\r\nFerns, as already stated, begin in the Middle Silurian formation with\r\nthe Eopteris Morrieri. In the Devonian, we have 79 species, in the\r\nCarboniferous 627, and in the Permian 186 species; after which fossil\r\nferns diminish greatly, though they are found in every formation; and\r\nthe fact that fully 3000 living species are known, while the richest\r\nportion of the Tertiary in fossil plants--the Miocene--- has only\r\nproduced 87 species, will serve to indicate the extreme imperfection of\r\nthe geological record.\r\n\r\nThe Equisetaceae (horsetails) which also first appear in the Silurian and\r\nreach their maximum development in the Coal formation, are, in all\r\nsucceeding formations, far less numerous than ferns, and only thirty\r\nliving species are known. Lycopodiaceae, though still more abundant in\r\nthe Coal formation, are very rarely found in any succeeding deposit,\r\nthough the living species are tolerably numerous, about 500 having been\r\ndescribed. As we cannot suppose them to have really diminished and then\r\nincreased again in this extraordinary manner, we have another indication\r\nof the exceptional nature of plant preservation and the extreme and\r\nerratic character of the imperfection of the record.\r\n\r\nPassing now to the next higher division of plants--the gymnosperms--we\r\nfind Coniferae appearing in the Upper Silurian, becoming tolerably\r\nabundant in the Devonian, and reaching a maximum in the Carboniferous,\r\nfrom which formation more than 300 species are known, equal to the\r\nnumber recorded as now living. They occur in all succeeding formations,\r\nbeing abundant in the Oolite, and excessively so in the Miocene, from\r\nwhich 250 species have been described. The allied family of gymnosperms,\r\nthe Cycadaceae, first appear in the Carboniferous era, but very\r\nscantily; are most abundant in the Oolite, from which formation 116\r\nspecies are known, and then steadily diminish to the Tertiary, although\r\nthere are seventy-five living species.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the true flowering plants, and we first meet with\r\nmonocotyledons in the Carboniferous and Permian formations. The\r\ncharacter of these fossils was long disputed, but is now believed to be\r\nwell established; and the sub-class continues to be present in small\r\nnumbers in all succeeding deposits, becoming rather plentiful in the\r\nUpper Cretaceous, and very abundant in the Eocene and Miocene. In the\r\nlatter formation 272 species have been discovered; but the 116 species\r\nin the Eocene form a larger proportion of the total vegetation of the\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nTrue dicotyledons appear very much later, in the Cretaceous period, and\r\nonly in its upper division, if we except a single species from the\r\nUrgonian beds of Greenland. The remarkable thing is that we here find\r\nthe sub-class fully developed and in great luxuriance of types, all the\r\nthree divisions--Apetalae, Polypetalae, and Gamopetalae--being\r\nrepresented, with a total of no less than 770 species. Among them are\r\nsuch familiar forms as the poplar, the birch, the beech, the sycamore,\r\nand the oak; as well as the fig, the true laurel, the sassafras, the\r\npersimmon, the maple, the walnut, the magnolia, and even the apple and\r\nthe plum tribes. Passing on to the Tertiary period the numbers increase,\r\ntill they reach their maximum in the Miocene, where more than 2000\r\nspecies of dicotyledons have been discovered. Among these the\r\nproportionate number of the higher gamopetalae has slightly increased,\r\nbut is considerably less than at the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Possible Cause of sudden late Appearance of Exogens._\r\n\r\nThe sudden appearance of fully developed exogenous flowering plants in\r\nthe Cretaceous period is very analogous to the equally sudden appearance\r\nof all the chief types of placental mammalia in the Eocene; and in both\r\ncases we must feel sure that this suddenness is only apparent, due to\r\nunknown conditions which have prevented their preservation (or their\r\ndiscovery) in earlier formations. The case of the dicotyledonous plants\r\nis in some respects the most extraordinary, because in the earlier\r\nMesozoic formations we appear to have a fair representation of the flora\r\nof the period, including such varied forms as ferns, equisetums, cycads,\r\nconifers, and monocotyledons. The only hint at an explanation of this\r\nanomaly has been given by Mr. Ball, who supposes that all these groups\r\ninhabited the lowlands, where there was not only excessive heat and\r\nmoisture, but also a superabundance of carbonic acid in the\r\natmosphere--conditions under which these groups had been developed, but\r\nwhich were prejudicial to the dicotyledons. These latter are supposed to\r\nhave originated on the high table-lands and mountain ranges, in a rarer\r\nand drier atmosphere in which the quantity of carbonic acid gas was much\r\nless; and any deposits formed in lake beds at high altitudes and at such\r\na remote epoch have been destroyed by denudation, and hence we have no\r\nrecord of their existence.[193]\r\n\r\nDuring a few weeks spent recently in the Rocky Mountains, I was struck\r\nby the great scarcity of monocotyledons and ferns in comparison with\r\ndicotyledons--a scarcity due apparently to the dryness and rarity of the\r\natmosphere favouring the higher groups. If we compare Coulter's _Rocky\r\nMountain Botany_ with Gray's _Botany of the Northern (East) United\r\nStates_, we have two areas which differ chiefly in the points of\r\naltitude and atmospheric moisture. Unfortunately, in neither of these\r\nworks are the species consecutively numbered; but by taking the pages\r\noccupied by the two divisions of dicotyledons on the one hand,\r\nmonocotyledons and ferns on the other, we can obtain a good\r\napproximation. In this way we find that in the flora of the\r\nNorth-Eastern States the monocotyledons and ferns are to the\r\ndicotyledons in the proportion of 45 to 100; in the Rocky Mountains they\r\nare in the proportion of only 34 to 100; while if we take an exclusively\r\nAlpine flora, as given by Mr. Ball, there are not one-fifth as many\r\nmonocotyledons as dicotyledons. These facts show that even at the\r\npresent day elevated plateaux and mountains are more favourable to\r\ndicotyledons than to monocotyledons, and we may, therefore, well suppose\r\nthat the former originated within such elevated areas, and were for long\r\nages confined to them. It is interesting to note that their richest\r\nearly remains have been found in the central regions of the North\r\nAmerican continent, where they now, proportionally, most abound, and\r\nwhere the conditions of altitude and a dry atmosphere were probably\r\npresent at a very early period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--Diagram illustrating the Geological\r\nDistribution of Plants.]\r\n\r\nThe diagram (Fig. 34), slightly modified from one given by Mr. Ward,\r\nwill illustrate our present knowledge of the development of the\r\nvegetable kingdom in geological time. The shaded vertical bands exhibit\r\nthe proportions of the fossil forms actually discovered, while the\r\noutline extensions are intended to show what we may fairly presume to\r\nhave been the approximate periods of origin, and progressive increase of\r\nthe number of species, of the chief divisions of the vegetable kingdom.\r\nThese seem to accord fairly well with their respective grades of\r\ndevelopment, and thus offer no obstacle to the acceptance of the belief\r\nin their progressive evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geological Distribution of Insects._\r\n\r\nThe marvellous development of insects into such an endless variety of\r\nforms, their extreme specialisation, and their adaptation to almost\r\nevery possible condition of life, would almost necessarily imply an\r\nextreme antiquity. Owing, however, to their small size, their lightness,\r\nand their usually aerial habits, no class of animals has been so\r\nscantily preserved in the rocks; and it is only recently that the whole\r\nof the scattered material relating to fossil insects and their allies\r\nhave been brought together by Mr. Samuel H. Scudder of Boston, and we\r\nhave thus learned their bearing on the theory of evolution.[194]\r\n\r\nThe most striking fact which presents itself on a glance at the\r\ndistribution of fossil insects, is the completeness of the\r\nrepresentation of all the chief types far back in the Secondary period,\r\nat which time many of the existing families appear to have been\r\nperfectly differentiated. Thus in the Lias we find dragonflies\r\n\"apparently as highly specialised as to-day, no less than four tribes\r\nbeing present.\" Of beetles we have undoubted Curculionidae from the Lias\r\nand Trias; Chrysomelidae in the same deposits; Cerambycidae in the\r\nOolites; Scarabaeidae in the Lias; Buprestidae in the Trias; Elateridae,\r\nTrogositidae, and Nitidulidae in the Lias; Staphylinidae in the English\r\nPurbecks; while Hydrophilidae, Gyrinidae, and Carabidae occur in the\r\nLias. All these forms are well represented, but there are many other\r\nfamilies doubtfully identified in equally ancient rocks. Diptera of the\r\nfamilies Empidae, Asilidae, and Tipulidae have been found as far back as\r\nthe Lias. Of Lepidoptera, Sphingidae and Tineidae have been found in\r\nthe Oolite; while ants, representing the highly specialised Hymenoptera,\r\nhave occurred in the Purbeck and Lias.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable identity of the families of very ancient with those of\r\nexisting insects is quite comparable with the apparently sudden\r\nappearance of existing genera of trees in the Cretaceous epoch. In both\r\ncases we feel certain that we must go very much farther back in order to\r\nfind the ancestral forms from which they were developed, and that at any\r\nmoment some fresh discovery may revolutionise our ideas as to the\r\nantiquity of certain groups. Such a discovery was made while Mr.\r\nScudder's work was passing through the press. Up to that date all the\r\nexisting orders of true insects appeared to have originated in the\r\nTrias, the alleged moth and beetle of the Coal formation having been\r\nincorrectly determined. But now, undoubted remains of beetles have been\r\nfound in the Coal measures of Silesia, thus supporting the\r\ninterpretation of the borings in carboniferous trees as having been made\r\nby insects of this order, and carrying back this highly specialised form\r\nof insect life well into Palaeozoic times. Such a discovery renders all\r\nspeculation as to the origin of true insects premature, because we may\r\nfeel sure that all the other orders of insects, except perhaps\r\nhymenoptera and lepidoptera, were contemporaneous with the highly\r\nspecialised beetles.\r\n\r\nThe less highly organised terrestrial arthropoda--the Arachnida and\r\nMyriapoda--are, as might be expected, much more ancient. A fossil spider\r\nhas been found in the Carboniferous, and scorpions in the Upper Silurian\r\nrocks of Scotland, Sweden, and the United States. Myriapoda have been\r\nfound abundantly in the Carboniferous and Devonian formations; but all\r\nare of extinct orders, exhibiting a more generalised structure than\r\nliving forms.\r\n\r\nMuch more extraordinary, however, is the presence in the Palaeozoic\r\nformations of ancestral forms of true insects, termed by Mr. Scudder\r\nPalaeodictyoptera. They consist of generalised cockroaches and\r\nwalking-stick insects (Orthopteroidea); ancient mayflies and allied\r\nforms, of which there are six families and more than thirty genera\r\n(Neuropteroidea); three genera of Hemipteroidea resembling various\r\nHomoptera and Hemiptera, mostly from the Carboniferous formation, a few\r\nfrom the Devonian, and one ancestral cockroach (Palaeoblattina) from\r\nthe Middle Silurian sandstone of France. If this occurrence of a true\r\nhexapod insect from the Middle Silurian be really established, taken in\r\nconnection with the well-defined Coleoptera from the Carboniferous, the\r\norigin of the entire group of terrestrial arthropoda is necessarily\r\nthrown back into the Cambrian epoch, if not earlier. And this cannot be\r\nconsidered improbable in view of the highly differentiated land\r\nplants--ferns, equisetums, and lycopods--in the Middle or Lower\r\nSilurian, and even a conifer (Cordaites Robbii) in the Upper Silurian;\r\nwhile the beds of graphite in the Laurentian were probably formed from\r\nterrestrial vegetation.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, we may affirm that, although the geological record\r\nof the insect life of the earth is exceptionally imperfect, it yet\r\ndecidedly supports the evolution hypothesis. The most specialised order,\r\nLepidoptera, is the most recent, only dating back to the Oolite; the\r\nHymenoptera, Diptera, and Homoptera go as far as the Lias; while the\r\nOrthoptera and Neuroptera extend to the Trias. The recent discovery of\r\nColeoptera in the Carboniferous shows, however, that the preceding\r\nlimits are not absolute, and will probably soon be overpassed. Only the\r\nmore generalised ancestral forms of winged insects have been traced back\r\nto Silurian time, and along with them the less highly organised\r\nscorpions; facts which serve to show us the extreme imperfection of our\r\nknowledge, and indicate possibilities of a world of terrestrial life in\r\nthe remotest Palaeozoic times.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geological Succession of Vertebrata._\r\n\r\nThe lowest forms of vertebrates are the fishes, and these appear first\r\nin the geological record in the Upper Silurian formation. The most\r\nancient known fish is a Pteraspis, one of the bucklered ganoids or\r\nplated fishes--by no means a very low type--allied to the sturgeon\r\n(Accipenser) and alligator-gar (Lepidosteus), but, as a group, now\r\nnearly extinct. Almost equally ancient are the sharks, which under\r\nvarious forms still abound in our seas. We cannot suppose these to be\r\nnearly the earliest fishes, especially as the two lowest orders, now\r\nrepresented by the Amphioxus or lancelet and the lampreys, have not yet\r\nbeen found fossil. The ganoids were greatly developed in the Devonian\r\nera, and continued till the Cretaceous, when they gave way to the true\r\nosseous fishes, which had first appeared in the Jurassic period, and\r\nhave continued to increase till the present day. This much later\r\nappearance of the higher osseous fishes is quite in accordance with\r\nevolution, although some of the very lowest forms, the lancelet and the\r\nlampreys, together with the archaic ceratodus, have survived to our\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe Amphibia, represented by the extinct labyrinthodons, appear first in\r\nthe Carboniferous rocks, and these peculiar forms became extinct early\r\nin the Secondary period. The labyrinthodons were, however, highly\r\nspecialised, and do not at all indicate the origin of the class, which\r\nmay be as ancient as the lower forms of fishes. Hardly any recognisable\r\nremains of our existing groups--the frogs, toads, and salamanders--are\r\nfound before the Tertiary period, a fact which indicates the extreme\r\nimperfection of the record as regards this class of animals.\r\n\r\nTrue reptiles have not been found till we reach the Permian where\r\nProhatteria and Proterosaurus occur, the former closely allied to the\r\nlizard-like Sphenodon of New Zealand, the latter having its nearest\r\nallies in the same group of reptiles--Rhyncocephala, other forms of\r\nwhich occur in the Trias. In this last-named formation the earliest\r\ncrocodiles--Phytosaurus (Belodon) and Stagonolepis occur, as well as the\r\nearliest tortoises--Chelytherium, Proganochelys, and Psephoderma.[195]\r\nFossil serpents have been first found in the Cretaceous formation, but\r\nthe conditions for the preservation of these forms have evidently been\r\nunfavourable, and the record is correspondingly incomplete. The marine\r\nPlesiosauri and Ichthyosauri, the flying Pterodactyles, the terrestrial\r\nIguanodon of Europe, and the huge Atlantosaurus of Colorado--the largest\r\nland animal that has ever lived upon the earth[196]--all belong to\r\nspecial developments of the reptilian type which flourished during the\r\nSecondary epoch, and then became extinct.\r\n\r\nBirds are among the rarest of fossils, due, no doubt, to their aerial\r\nhabits removing them from the ordinary dangers of flood, bog, or ice\r\nwhich overwhelm mammals and reptiles, and also to their small specific\r\ngravity which keeps them floating on the surface of water till devoured.\r\nTheir remains were long confined to Tertiary deposits, where many living\r\ngenera and a few extinct forms have been found. The only birds yet known\r\nfrom the older rocks are the toothed birds (Odontornithes) of the\r\nCretaceous beds of the United States, belonging to two distinct families\r\nand many genera; a penguin-like form (Enaliornis) from the Upper\r\nGreensand of Cambridge; and the well-known long-tailed Archaeopteryx\r\nfrom the Upper Oolite of Bavaria. The record is thus imperfect and\r\nfragmentary in the extreme; but it yet shows us, in the few birds\r\ndiscovered in the older rocks, more primitive and generalised types,\r\nwhile the Tertiary birds had already become specialised like those\r\nliving, and had lost both the teeth and the long vertebral tail, which\r\nindicate reptilian affinities in the earlier Mammalia have been found,\r\nas already stated, as far back as the Trias formation, in Europe in the\r\nUnited States and in South Africa, all being very small, and belonging\r\neither to the Marsupial order, or to some still lower and more\r\ngeneralised type, out of which both Marsupials and Insectivora were\r\ndeveloped. Other allied forms have been found in the Lower and Upper\r\nOolite both of Europe and the United States. But there is then a great\r\ngap in the whole Cretaceous formation, from which no mammal has been\r\nobtained, although both in the Wealden and the Upper Chalk in Europe,\r\nand in the Upper Cretaceous deposits of the United States an abundant\r\nand well-preserved terrestrial flora has been discovered. Why no mammals\r\nhave left their remains here it is impossible to say. We can only\r\nsuppose that the limited areas in which land plants have been so\r\nabundantly preserved, did not present the conditions which are needed\r\nfor the fossilisation and preservation of mammalian remains.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the Tertiary formation, we find mammals in abundance;\r\nbut a wonderful change has taken place. The obscure early types have\r\ndisappeared, and we discover in their place a whole series of forms\r\nbelonging to existing orders, and even sometimes to existing families.\r\nThus, in the Eocene we have remains of the opossum family; bats\r\napparently belonging to living genera; rodents allied to the South\r\nAmerican cavies and to dormice and squirrels; hoofed animals belonging\r\nto the odd-toed and even-toed groups; and ancestral forms of cats,\r\ncivets, dogs, with a number of more generalised forms of carnivora.\r\nBesides these there are whales, lemurs, and many strange ancestral forms\r\nof proboscidea.[197]\r\n\r\nThe great diversity of forms and structures at so remote an epoch would\r\nrequire for their development an amount of time, which, judging by the\r\nchanges that have occurred in other groups, would carry us back far into\r\nthe Mesozoic period. In order to understand why we have no record of\r\nthese changes in any part of the world, we must fall back upon some such\r\nsupposition as we made in the case of the dicotyledonous plants.\r\nPerhaps, indeed, the two cases are really connected, and the upland\r\nregions of the primeval world, which saw the development of our higher\r\nvegetation, may have also afforded the theatre for the gradual\r\ndevelopment of the varied mammalian types which surprise us by their\r\nsudden appearance in Tertiary times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION OF MAMMALIA.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these irregularities and gaps in the record, the\r\naccompanying table, summarising our actual knowledge of the geological\r\ndistribution of the five classes of vertebrata, exhibits a steady\r\nprogression from lower to higher types, excepting only the deficiency in\r\nthe bird record which is easily explained. The comparative perfection of\r\ntype in which each of these classes first appears, renders it certain\r\nthat the origin of each and all of them must be sought much farther back\r\nthan any records which have yet been discovered. The researches of\r\npalaeontologists and embryologists indicate a reptilian origin for birds\r\nand mammals, while reptiles and amphibia arose, perhaps independently,\r\nfrom fishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Concluding Remarks._\r\n\r\nThe brief review we have now taken of the more suggestive facts\r\npresented by the geological succession of organic forms, is sufficient\r\nto show that most, if not all, of the supposed difficulties which it\r\npresents in the way of evolution, are due either to imperfections in the\r\ngeological record itself, or to our still very incomplete knowledge of\r\nwhat is really recorded in the earth's crust. We learn, however, that\r\njust as discovery progresses, gaps are filled up and difficulties\r\ndisappear; while, in the case of many individual groups, we have already\r\nobtained all the evidence of progressive development that can reasonably\r\nbe expected. We conclude, therefore, that the geological difficulty has\r\nnow disappeared; and that this noble science, when properly understood,\r\naffords clear and weighty evidence of evolution.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 183: The reader who desires to understand this subject more\r\nfully, should study chap. x. of the _Origin of Species_, and chap. xiv.\r\nof Sir Charles Lyell's _Principles of Geology_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 184: On \"Stagonolepis Robertsoni and on the Evolution of the\r\nCrocodilia,\" in _Q.J. of Geological Society_, 1875; and abstract in\r\n_Nature_, vol. xii. p. 38.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 185: From a paper by Messrs.

It is the more necessary to do this, because there is now a\r\ntendency to minimise the action of natural selection in the production\r\nof organic forms, and to set up in its place certain fundamental\r\nprinciples of variation or laws of growth, which it is urged are the\r\nreal originators of the several lines of development, and of most of the\r\nvariety of form and structure in the vegetable and animal kingdoms.\r\nThese views have, moreover, been seized upon by popular writers to throw\r\ndoubt and discredit on the whole theory of evolution, and especially on\r\nDarwin's presentation of that theory, to the bewilderment of the general\r\npublic, who are quite unable to decide how far the new views, even if\r\nwell established, tend to subvert the Darwinian theory, or whether they\r\nare really more than subsidiary parts of it, and quite powerless without\r\nit to produce any effect whatever.\r\n\r\nThe writers whose special views we now propose to consider are: (1) Mr.\r\nHerbert Spencer, on modification of structures arising from modification\r\nof functions, as set forth in his _Factors of Organic Evolution_. (2)\r\nDr. E.D. Cope, who advocates similar views in detail, in his work\r\nentitled _The Origin of the Fittest_, and may be considered the head of\r\na school of American naturalists who minimise the agency of natural\r\nselection. (3) Dr. Karl Semper, who has especially studied the direct\r\ninfluence of the environment in the whole animal kingdom, and has set\r\nforth his views in a volume on _The Natural Conditions of Existence as\r\nthey Affect Animal Life_. (4) Mr. Patrick Geddes, who urges that\r\nfundamental laws of growth, and the antagonism of vegetative and\r\nreproductive forces, account for much that has been imputed to natural\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nWe will now endeavour to ascertain what are the more important facts and\r\narguments adduced by each of the above writers, and how far they offer a\r\nsubstitute for the action of natural selection; having done which, a\r\nbrief account will be given of the views of Dr. Aug. Weismann, whose\r\ntheory of heredity will, if established, strike at the very root of the\r\narguments of the first three of the writers above referred to.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Herbert Spencer's Factors of Organic Evolution._\r\n\r\nMr. Spencer, while fully recognising the importance and wide range of\r\nthe principle of natural selection, thinks that sufficient weight has\r\nnot been given to the effects of use and disuse as a factor in\r\nevolution, or to the direct action of the environment in determining or\r\nmodifying organic structures. As examples of the former class of\r\nactions, he adduces the decreased size of the jaws in the civilised\r\nraces of mankind, the inheritance of nervous disease produced by\r\noverwork, the great and inherited development of the udders in cows and\r\ngoats, and the shortened legs, jaws, and snout in improved races of\r\npigs--the two latter examples being quoted from Mr. Darwin,--and other\r\ncases of like nature. As examples of the latter, Mr. Darwin is again\r\nquoted as admitting that there are many cases in which the action of\r\nsimilar conditions appears to have produced corresponding changes in\r\ndifferent species; and we have a very elaborate discussion of the direct\r\naction of the medium in modifying the protoplasm of simple organisms, so\r\nas to bring about the difference between the outer surface and the inner\r\npart that characterises the cells or other units of which they are\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nNow, although this essay did little more than bring together facts which\r\nhad been already adduced by Mr. Darwin or by Mr. Spencer himself, and\r\nlay stress upon their importance, its publication in a popular review\r\nwas immediately seized upon as \"an avowed and definite declaration\r\nagainst some of the leading ideas on which the Mechanical Philosophy\r\ndepends,\" and as being \"fatal to the adequacy of the Mechanical\r\nPhilosophy as any explanation of organic evolution,\"[198]--an expression\r\nof opinion which would be repudiated by every Darwinian. For, even\r\nadmitting the interpretation which Mr. Spencer puts on the facts he\r\nadduces, they are all included in the causes which Darwin himself\r\nrecognised as having acted in bringing about the infinitude of forms in\r\nthe organic world. In the concluding chapter of the _Origin of Species_\r\nhe says: \"I have now recapitulated the facts and considerations which\r\nhave thoroughly convinced me that species have been modified during a\r\nlong course of descent. This has been effected chiefly through the\r\nnatural selection of numerous successive, slight, favourable variations;\r\naided in an important manner by the inherited effects of the use and\r\ndisuse of parts; and in an unimportant manner--that is, in relation to\r\nadaptive structures whether past or present, by the direct action of\r\nexternal conditions, and by variations which seem to us, in our\r\nignorance, to arise spontaneously.\" This passage, summarising Darwin's\r\nwhole inquiry, and explaining his final point of view, shows how very\r\ninaccurate may be the popular notion, as expressed by the Duke of\r\nArgyll, of any supposed additions to the causes of change of species as\r\nrecognised by Darwin.\r\n\r\nBut, as we shall see presently, there is now much reason to believe\r\nthat the supposed inheritance of acquired modifications--that is, of the\r\neffects of use and disuse, or of the direct influence of the\r\nenvironment--is not a fact; and if so, the very foundation is taken away\r\nfrom the whole class of objections on which so much stress is now laid.\r\nIt therefore becomes important to inquire whether the facts adduced by\r\nDarwin, Spencer, and others, do really necessitate such inheritance, or\r\nwhether any other interpretation of them is possible. I believe there is\r\nsuch an interpretation; and we will first consider the cases of disuse\r\non which Mr. Spencer lays most stress.\r\n\r\nThe cases Mr. Spencer adduces as demonstrating the effects of disuse in\r\ndiminishing the size and strength of organs are, the diminished size of\r\nthe jaws in the races of civilised men, and the diminution of the\r\nmuscles used in closing the jaws in the case of pet-dogs fed for\r\ngenerations on soft food. He argues that the minute reduction in any one\r\ngeneration could not possibly have been useful, and, therefore, not the\r\nsubject of natural selection; and against the theory of correlation of\r\nthe diminished jaw with increased brain in man, he urges that there are\r\ncases of large brain development, accompanied by jaws above the average\r\nsize. Against the theory of economy of nutrition in the case of the\r\npet-dogs, he places the abundant food of these animals which would\r\nrender such economy needless.\r\n\r\nBut neither he nor Mr. Darwin has considered the effects of the\r\nwithdrawal of the action of natural selection in keeping up the parts in\r\nquestion to their full dimensions, which, of itself, seems to me quite\r\nadequate to produce the results observed. Recurring to the evidence,\r\nadduced in Chapter III, of the constant variation occurring in all parts\r\nof the organism, while selection is constantly acting on these\r\nvariations in eliminating all that fall below the best working standard,\r\nand preserving only those that are fully up to it; and, remembering\r\nfurther, that, of the whole number of the increase produced annually,\r\nonly a small percentage of the best adapted can be preserved, we shall\r\nsee that every useful organ will be kept up nearly to its higher limit\r\nof size and efficiency. Now Mr. Galton has proved experimentally that,\r\nwhen any part has thus been increased (or diminished) by selection,\r\nthere is in the offspring a strong tendency to revert to a mean or\r\naverage size, which tends to check further increase. And this mean\r\nappears to be, not the mean of the actual existing individuals but a\r\nlower mean, or that from which they had been recently raised by\r\nselection.[199] He calls this the law of \"Regression towards\r\nMediocrity,\" and it has been proved by experiments with vegetables and\r\nby observations on mankind. This regression, in every generation, takes\r\nplace even when both parents have been selected for their high\r\ndevelopment of the organ in question; but when there is no such\r\nselection, and crosses are allowed among individuals of every grade of\r\ndevelopment, the deterioration will be very rapid; and after a time not\r\nonly will the average size of the part be greatly reduced, but the\r\ninstances of full development will become very rare. Thus what Weismann\r\nterms \"panmixia,\" or free intercrossing, will co-operate with Galton's\r\nlaw of \"regression towards mediocrity,\" and the result will be that,\r\nwhenever selection ceases to act on any part or organ which has\r\nheretofore been kept up to a maximum of size and efficiency, the organ\r\nin question will rapidly decrease till it reaches a mean value\r\nconsiderably below the mean of the progeny that has usually been\r\nproduced each year, and very greatly below the mean of that portion\r\nwhich has survived annually; and this will take place by the general law\r\nof heredity, and quite irrespective of any _use_ or _disuse_ of the part\r\nin question. Now, no observations have been adduced by Mr. Spencer or\r\nothers, showing that the average amount of change supposed to be due to\r\n_disuse_ is greater than that due to the law of regression towards\r\nmediocrity; while even if it were somewhat greater, we can see many\r\npossible contributory causes to its production. In the case of civilised\r\nman's diminished jaw, there may well be some correlation between the jaw\r\nand the brain, seeing that increased mental activity would lead to the\r\nwithdrawal of blood and of nervous energy from adjacent parts, and might\r\nthus lead to diminished growth of those parts in the individual. And in\r\nthe case of pet-dogs, the selection of small or short-headed individuals\r\nwould imply the unconscious selection of those with less massive\r\ntemporal muscles, and thus lead to the concomitant reduction of those\r\nmuscles. The amount of reduction observed by Darwin in the wing-bones of\r\ndomestic ducks and poultry, and in the hind legs of tame rabbits, is\r\nvery small, and is certainly no greater than the above causes will well\r\naccount for; while so many of the external characters of all our\r\ndomestic animals have been subject to long-continued artificial\r\nselection, and we are so ignorant of the possible correlations of\r\ndifferent parts, that the phenomena presented by them seem sufficiently\r\nexplained without recurrence to the assumption that any changes in the\r\nindividual, due to disuse, are inherited by the offspring.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Supposed Effects of Disuse among Wild Animals._\r\n\r\nIt may be urged, however, that among wild animals we have many undoubted\r\nresults of disuse much more pronounced than those among domestic kinds,\r\nresults which cannot be explained by the causes already adduced. Such\r\nare the reduced size of the wings of many birds on oceanic islands; the\r\nabortion of the eyes in many cave animals, and in some which live\r\nunderground; and the loss of the hind limbs in whales and in some\r\nlizards. These cases differ greatly in the amount of the reduction of\r\nparts which has taken place, and may be due to different causes. It is\r\nremarkable that in some of the birds of oceanic islands the reduction is\r\nlittle if at all greater than in domestic birds, as in the water-hen of\r\nTristan d'Acunha. Now if the reduction of wing were due to the\r\nhereditary effects of disuse, we should expect a very much greater\r\neffect in a bird inhabiting an oceanic island than in a domestic bird,\r\nwhere the disuse has been in action for an indefinitely shorter period.\r\nIn the case of many other birds, however--as some of the New Zealand\r\nrails and the extinct dodo of Mauritius--the wings have been reduced to\r\na much more rudimentary condition, though it is still obvious that they\r\nwere once organs of flight; and in these cases we certainly require some\r\nother causes than those which have reduced the wings of our domestic\r\nfowls. One such cause may have been of the same nature as that which has\r\nbeen so efficient in reducing the wings of the insects of oceanic\r\nislands--the destruction of those which, during the occasional use of\r\ntheir wings, were carried out to sea. This form of natural selection may\r\nwell have acted in the case of birds whose powers of flight were\r\nalready somewhat reduced, and to whom, there being no enemies to escape\r\nfrom, their use was only a source of danger. We may thus, perhaps,\r\naccount for the fact that many of these birds retain small but useless\r\nwings with which they never fly; for, the wings having been reduced to\r\nthis functionless condition, no power could reduce them further except\r\ncorrelation of growth or economy of nutrition, causes which only rarely\r\ncome into play.\r\n\r\nThe complete loss of eyes in some cave animals may, perhaps, be\r\nexplained in a somewhat similar way. Whenever, owing to the total\r\ndarkness, they became useless, they might also become injurious, on\r\naccount of their delicacy of organisation and liability to accidents and\r\ndisease; in which case natural selection would begin to act to reduce,\r\nand finally abort them; and this explains why, in some cases, the\r\nrudimentary eye remains, although completely covered by a protective\r\nouter skin. Whales, like moas and cassowaries, carry us back to a remote\r\npast, of whose conditions we know too little for safe speculation. We\r\nare quite ignorant of the ancestral forms of either of these groups, and\r\nare therefore without the materials needful for determining the steps by\r\nwhich the change took place, or the causes which brought it about.[200]\r\n\r\nOn a review of the various examples that have been given by Mr. Darwin\r\nand others of organs that have been reduced or aborted, there seems too\r\nmuch diversity in the results for all to be due to so direct and uniform\r\na cause as the individual effects of disuse accumulated by heredity. For\r\nif that were the only or chief efficient cause, and a cause capable of\r\nproducing a decided effect during the comparatively short period of the\r\nexistence of animals in a state of domestication, we should expect to\r\nfind that, in wild species, all unused parts or organs had been reduced\r\nto the smallest rudiments, or had wholly disappeared. Instead of this we\r\nfind various grades of reduction, indicating the probable result of\r\nseveral distinct causes, sometimes acting separately, sometimes in\r\ncombination, such as those we have already pointed out.\r\n\r\nAnd if we find no positive evidence of _disuse_, acting by its direct\r\neffect on the individual, being transmitted to the offspring, still less\r\ncan we find such evidence in the case of the _use_ of organs. For here\r\nthe very fact of _use_, in a wild state, implies _utility_, and utility\r\nis the constant subject for the action of natural selection; while among\r\ndomestic animals those parts which are exceptionally used are so used in\r\nthe service of man, and have thus become the subjects of artificial\r\nselection. Thus \"the great and inherited development of the udders in\r\ncows and goats,\" quoted by Spencer from Darwin, really affords no proof\r\nof inheritance of the increase due to use, because, from the earliest\r\nperiod of the domestication of these animals, abundant milk-production\r\nhas been highly esteemed, and has thus been the subject of selection;\r\nwhile there are no cases among wild animals that may not be better\r\nexplained by variation and natural selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Difficulty as to Co-adaptation of Parts by Variation and Selection._\r\n\r\nMr. Spencer again brings forward this difficulty, as he did in his\r\n_Principles of Biology_ twenty-five years ago, and urges that all the\r\nadjustments of bones, muscles, blood-vessels, and nerves which would be\r\nrequired during, for example, the development of the neck and fore-limbs\r\nof the giraffe, could not have been effected by \"simultaneous fortunate\r\nspontaneous variations.\" But this difficulty is fully disposed of by the\r\nfacts of simultaneous variation adduced in our third chapter, and has\r\nalso been specially considered in Chapter VI, p. 127. The best answer to\r\nthis objection may, perhaps, be found in the fact that the very thing\r\nsaid to be impossible by variation and natural selection has been again\r\nand again effected by variation and artificial selection. During the\r\nprocess of formation of such breeds as the greyhound or the bulldog, of\r\nthe race-horse and carthorse, of the fantail pigeon or the otter-sheep,\r\nmany co-ordinate adjustments have been produced; and no difficulty has\r\noccurred, whether the change has been effected by a single variation--as\r\nin the last case named--or by slow steps, as in all the others. It seems\r\nto be forgotten that most animals have such a surplus of vitality and\r\nstrength for all the ordinary occasions of life that any slight\r\nsuperiority in one part can be at once utilised; while the moment any\r\nwant of balance occurs, variations in the insufficiently developed parts\r\nwill be selected to bring back the harmony of the whole organisation.\r\nThe fact that, in all domestic animals, variations do occur, rendering\r\nthem swifter or stronger, larger or smaller, stouter or slenderer, and\r\nthat such variations can be separately selected and accumulated for\r\nman's purposes, is sufficient to render it certain that similar or even\r\ngreater changes may be effected by natural selection, which, as Darwin\r\nwell remarks, \"acts on every internal organ, on every shade of\r\nconstitututional difference, on the whole machinery of life.\" The\r\ndifficulty as to co-adaptation of parts by variation and natural\r\nselection appears to me, therefore, to be a wholly imaginary difficulty\r\nwhich has no place whatever in the operations of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Direct Action of the Environment._\r\n\r\nMr. Spencer's last objection to the wide scope given by Darwinians to\r\nthe agency of natural selection is, that organisms are acted upon by the\r\nenvironment, which produces in them definite changes, and that these\r\nchanges in the individual are transmitted by inheritance, and thus\r\nbecome increased in successive generations. That such changes are\r\nproduced in the individual there is ample evidence, but that they are\r\ninherited independently of any form of selection or of reversion is\r\nexceedingly doubtful, and Darwin nowhere expresses himself as satisfied\r\nwith the evidence. The two very strongest cases he mentions are the\r\ntwenty-nine species of American trees which all differed in a\r\ncorresponding way from their nearest European allies; and the American\r\nmaize which became changed after three generations in Europe. But in the\r\ncase of the trees the differences alleged may be partly due to\r\ncorrelation with constitutional peculiarities dependent on climate,\r\nespecially as regards the deeper tint of the fading leaves and the\r\nsmaller size of the buds and seeds in America than in Europe; while the\r\nless deeply toothed or serrated leaves in the American species are, in\r\nour present complete ignorance of the causes and uses of serration,\r\nquite as likely to be due to some form of adaptation as to any direct\r\naction of the climate. Again, we are not told how many of the allied\r\nspecies do not vary in this particular manner, and this is certainly an\r\nimportant factor in any conclusion we may form on the question.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the maize it appears that one of the more remarkable and\r\nhighly selected American varieties was cultivated in Germany, and in\r\nthree years nearly all resemblance to the original parent was lost; and\r\nin the sixth year it closely resembled a common European variety, but\r\nwas of somewhat more vigorous growth. In this case no selection appears\r\nto have been practised, and the effects may have been due to that\r\n\"reversion to mediocrity\" which invariably occurs, and is more\r\nespecially marked in the case of varieties which have been rapidly\r\nproduced by artificial selection. It may be considered as a partial\r\nreversion to the wild or unimproved stock; and the same thing would\r\nprobably have occurred, though perhaps less rapidly, in America itself.\r\nAs this is stated by Darwin to be the most remarkable case known to him\r\n\"of the direct and prompt action of climate on a plant,\" we must\r\nconclude that such direct effects have not been proved to be accumulated\r\nby inheritance, independently of reversion or selection.\r\n\r\nThe remaining part of Mr. Spencer's essay is devoted to a consideration\r\nof the hypothetical action of the environment on the lower organisms\r\nwhich consist of simple cells or formless masses of protoplasm; and he\r\nshows with great elaboration that the outer and inner parts of these\r\nare necessarily subject to different conditions; and that the outer\r\nactions of air or water lead to the formation of integuments, and\r\nsometimes to other definite modifications of the surface, whence arise\r\npermanent differences of structure. Although in these cases also it is\r\nvery difficult to determine how much is due to direct modification by\r\nexternal agencies transmitted and accumulated by inheritance, and how\r\nmuch to spontaneous variations accumulated by natural selection, the\r\nprobabilities in favour of the former mode of action are here greater,\r\nbecause there is no differentiation of nutritive and reproductive cells\r\nin these simple organisms; and it can be readily seen that any change\r\nproduced in the latter will almost certainly affect the next\r\ngeneration.[201] We are thus carried back almost to the origin of life,\r\nand can only vaguely speculate on what took place under conditions of\r\nwhich we know so little.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The American School of Evolutionists._\r\n\r\nThe tentative views of Mr. Spencer which we have just discussed, are\r\ncarried much further, and attempts have been made to work them out in\r\ngreat detail, by many American naturalists, whose best representative is\r\nDr. E.D. Cope of Philadelphia.[202] This school endeavours to explain\r\nall the chief modifications of form in the animal kingdom by fundamental\r\nlaws of growth and the inherited effects of use and effort, returning,\r\nin fact, to the teachings of Lamarck as being at least equally important\r\nwith those of Darwin.\r\n\r\nThe following extract will serve to show the high position claimed by\r\nthis school as original discoverers, and as having made important\r\nadditions to the theory of evolution:\r\n\r\n\"Wallace and Darwin have propounded as the cause of modification in\r\ndescent their law of natural selection. This law has been epitomised by\r\nSpencer as the 'survival of the fittest.' This neat expression no doubt\r\ncovers the case, but it leaves the origin of the fittest entirely\r\nuntouched. Darwin assumes a 'tendency to variation' in nature, and it is\r\nplainly necessary to do this, in order that materials for the exercise\r\nof a selection should exist. Darwin and Wallace's law is then only\r\nrestrictive, directive, conservative, or destructive of something\r\nalready created. I propose, then, to seek for the originative laws by\r\nwhich these subjects are furnished; in other words, for the causes of\r\nthe origin of the fittest.\"[203]\r\n\r\nMr. Cope lays great stress on the existence of a special developmental\r\nforce termed \"bathmism\" or growth-force, which acts by means of\r\nretardation and acceleration \"without any reference to fitness at all;\"\r\nthat \"instead of being controlled by fitness it is the controller of\r\nfitness.\" He argues that \"all the characteristics of generalised groups\r\nfrom genera up (excepting, perhaps, families) have been evolved under\r\nthe law of acceleration and retardation,\" combined with some\r\nintervention of natural selection; and that specific characters, or\r\nspecies, have been evolved by natural selection with some assistance\r\nfrom the higher law. He, therefore, makes species and genera two\r\nabsolutely distinct things, the latter not developed out of the former;\r\ngeneric characters and specific characters are, in his opinion,\r\nfundamentally different, and have had different origins, and whole\r\ngroups of species have been simultaneously modified, so as to belong to\r\nanother genus; whence he thinks it \"highly probable that the same\r\nspecific form has existed through a succession of genera, and perhaps in\r\ndifferent epochs of geologic time.\"\r\n\r\nUseful characters, he concludes, have been produced by the special\r\nlocation of growth-force by use; useless ones have been produced by\r\nlocation of growth-force without the influence of use. Another element\r\nwhich determines the direction of growth-force, and which precedes use,\r\nis effort; and \"it is thought that effort becomes incorporated into the\r\nmetaphysical acquisitions of the parent, and is inherited with other\r\nmetaphysical qualities by the young, which, during the period of growth,\r\nis much more susceptible to modifying influences, and is likely to\r\nexhibit structural change in consequence.\"[204]\r\n\r\nFrom these few examples of their teachings, it is clear that these\r\nAmerican evolutionists have departed very widely from the views of Mr.\r\nDarwin, and in place of the well-established causes and admitted laws to\r\nwhich he appeals have introduced theoretical conceptions which have not\r\nyet been tested by experiments or facts, as well as metaphysical\r\nconceptions which are incapable of proof. And when they come to\r\nillustrate these views by an appeal to palaeontology or morphology, we\r\nfind that a far simpler and more complete explanation of the facts is\r\nafforded by the established principles of variation and natural\r\nselection. The confidence with which these new ideas are enunciated, and\r\nthe repeated assertion that without them Darwinism is powerless to\r\nexplain the origin of organic forms, renders it necessary to bestow a\r\nlittle more time on the explanations they give us of well-known\r\nphenomena with which, they assert, other theories are incompetent to\r\ngrapple.\r\n\r\nAs examples of use producing structural change, Mr. Cope adduces the\r\nhooked and toothed beaks of the falcons and the butcher-birds, and he\r\nargues that the fact of these birds belonging to widely different groups\r\nproves that similarity of use has produced a similar structural result.\r\nBut no attempt is made to show any direct causal connection between the\r\nuse of a bill to cut or tear flesh and the development of a tooth on the\r\nmandible. Such use might conceivably strengthen the bill or increase its\r\nsize, but not cause a special tooth-like outgrowth which was not present\r\nin the ancestral thrush-like forms of the butcher-bird. On the other\r\nhand, it is clear that any variations of the bill tending towards a hook\r\nor tooth would give the possessor some advantage in seizing and tearing\r\nits prey, and would thus be preserved and increased by natural\r\nselection. Again, Mr. Cope urges the effects of a supposed \"law of polar\r\nor centrifugal growth\" to counteract a tendency to unsymmetrical growth,\r\nwhere one side of the body is used more than the other. But the\r\nundoubted hurtfulness of want of symmetry in many important actions or\r\nfunctions would rapidly eliminate any such tendency. When, however, it\r\nhas become useful, as in the case of the single enlarged claw of many\r\nCrustacea, it has been preserved by natural selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Origin of the Feet of the Ungulates._\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most original and suggestive of Mr. Cope's applications of\r\nthe theory of use and effort in modifying structure are, his chapters\r\n\"On the Origin of the Foot-Structure of the Ungulates;\" and that \"On the\r\nEffect of Impacts and Strains on the Feet of Mammalia;\" and they will\r\nserve also to show the comparative merits of this theory and that of\r\nnatural selection in explaining a difficult case of modification,\r\nespecially as it is an explanation claimed as new and original when\r\nfirst enunciated in 1881. Let us, then, see how he deals with the\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable progressive change of a four or five-toed ancestor into\r\nthe one-toed horse, and the equally remarkable division of the whole\r\ngroup of ungulate animals into the odd-toed and even-toed divisions, Mr.\r\nCope attempts to explain by the effects of impact and use among animals\r\nwhich frequented hard or swampy ground respectively. On hard ground, it\r\nis urged, the long middle toe would be most used and subjected to the\r\ngreatest strains, and would therefore acquire both strength and\r\ndevelopment. It would then be still more exclusively used, and the extra\r\nnourishment required by it would be drawn from the adjacent less-used\r\ntoes, which would accordingly diminish in size, till, after a long\r\nseries of changes, the records of which are so well preserved in the\r\nAmerican tertiary rocks, the true one-toed horse was developed. In soft\r\nor swampy ground, on the other hand, the tendency would be to spread out\r\nthe foot so that there were two toes on each side. The two middle toes\r\nwould thus be most used and most subject to strains, and would,\r\ntherefore, increase at the expense of the lateral toes. There would be,\r\nno doubt, an advantage in these two functional toes being of equal size,\r\nso as to prevent twisting of the foot while walking; and variations\r\ntending to bring this about would be advantageous, and would therefore\r\nbe preserved. Thus, by a parallel series of changes in another\r\ndirection, adapted to a distinct set of conditions, we should arrive at\r\nthe symmetrical divided hoofs of our deer and cattle. The fact that\r\nsheep and goats are specially mountain and rock-loving animals may be\r\nexplained by their being a later modification, since the divided hoof\r\nonce formed is evidently well adapted to secure a firm footing on rugged\r\nand precipitous ground, although it could hardly have been first\r\ndeveloped in such localities. Mr. Cope thus concludes: \"Certain it is\r\nthat the length of the bones in the feet of the ungulate orders has a\r\ndirect relation to the dryness of the ground they inhabit, and the\r\npossibility of speed which their habit permits them or necessarily\r\nimposes on them.\"[205]\r\n\r\nIf there is any truth in the explanation here briefly summarised, it\r\nmust entirely depend on the fact of individual modifications thus\r\nproduced being hereditary, and we yet await the proof of this. In the\r\nmeantime it is clear that the very same results could have been brought\r\nabout by variation and natural selection. For the toes, like all other\r\norgans, vary in size and proportions, and in their degree of union or\r\nseparation; and if in one group of animals it was beneficial to have the\r\nmiddle toe larger and longer, and in another set to have the two middle\r\ntoes of the same size, nothing can be more certain than that these\r\nparticular modifications would be continuously preserved, and the very\r\nresults we see ultimately produced.\r\n\r\nThe oft-repeated objections that the cause of variations is unknown,\r\nthat there must be something to determine variations in the right\r\ndirection; that \"natural selection includes no actively progressive\r\nprinciple, but must wait for the development of variation, and then,\r\nafter securing the survival of the best, wait again for the best to\r\nproject its own variations for selection,\" we have already sufficiently\r\nanswered by showing that variation--in abundant or typical species--is\r\nalways present in ample amount; that it exists in all parts and organs;\r\nthat these vary, for the most part, independently, so that any required\r\ncombination of variations can be secured; and finally, that all\r\nvariation is necessarily either in excess or defect of the mean\r\ncondition, and that, consequently, the right or favourable variations\r\nare so frequently present that the unerring power of natural selection\r\nnever wants materials to work upon.\r\n\r\n_Supposed Action of Animal Intelligence._\r\n\r\nThe following passage briefly summarises Mr. Cope's position:\r\n\"Intelligence is a conservative principle, and will always direct effort\r\nand use into lines which will be beneficial to its possessor. Here we\r\nhave the source of the fittest, _i.e._ addition of parts by increase and\r\nlocation of growth-force, directed by the influence of various kinds of\r\ncompulsion in the lower, and intelligent option among higher animals.\r\nThus intelligent choice, taking advantage of the successive evolution of\r\nphysical conditions, may be regarded as the _originator of the fittest_,\r\nwhile natural selection is the tribunal to which all results of\r\naccelerated growth are submitted. This preserves or destroys them, and\r\ndetermines the new points of departure on which accelerated growth shall\r\nbuild.\"[206]\r\n\r\nThis notion of \"intelligence\"--the intelligence of the animal\r\nitself--determining its own variation, is so evidently a very partial\r\ntheory, inapplicable to the whole vegetable kingdom, and almost so to\r\nall the lower forms of animals, amongst which, nevertheless, there is\r\nthe very same adaptation and co-ordination of parts and functions as\r\namong the highest, that it is strange to see it put forward with such\r\nconfidence as necessary for the completion of Darwin's theory. If \"the\r\nvarious kinds of compulsion\"--by which are apparently meant the laws of\r\nvariation, growth, and reproduction, the struggle for existence, and the\r\nactions necessary to preserve life under the conditions of the animal's\r\nenvironment--are sufficient to have developed the varied forms of the\r\nlower animals and of plants, we can see no reason why the same\r\n\"compulsion\" should not have carried on the development of the higher\r\nanimals also. The action of this \"intelligent option\" is altogether\r\nunproved; while the acknowledgment that natural selection is the\r\ntribunal which either preserves or destroys the variations submitted to\r\nit, seems quite inconsistent with the statement that intelligent choice\r\nis the \"orginator of the fittest,\" since whatever is really \"the\r\nfittest\" can never be destroyed by natural selection, which is but\r\nanother name for the survival of the fittest. If \"the fittest\" is always\r\ndefinitely produced by some other power, then natural selection is not\r\nwanted. If, on the other hand, both fit and unfit are produced, and\r\nnatural selection decides between them, that is pure Darwinism, and Mr.\r\nCope's theories have added nothing to it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--Transformation of Artemia salina to A.\r\nMilhausenii; 1, tail-lobe of A. salina, and its transition through\r\n2,3,4,5, to 6, into that of A.

(From Schmankewitsch.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Semper on the Direct Influence of the Environment._\r\n\r\nAnother eminent naturalist, Professor Karl Semper of Würzburg, also\r\nadopts the view of the direct transforming power of the environment, and\r\nhas brought together an immense body of interesting facts showing the\r\ninfluence of food, of light, of temperature, of still water and moving\r\nwater, of the atmosphere and its currents, of gravitation, and of other\r\norganisms, in modifying the forms and other characteristics of\r\nanimals.[207] He believes that these various influences produce a direct\r\nand important effect, and that this effect is accumulated by\r\ninheritance; yet he acknowledges that we have no direct evidence of\r\nthis, and there is hardly a single case adduced in the book which is not\r\nequally well explained by adaptation, brought about by the survival of\r\nbeneficial variations. Perhaps the most remarkable case he has brought\r\nforward is that of the transformation of species of crustaceans by a\r\nchange in the saltness of the water (see Fig. 35). Artemia salina lives\r\nin brackish water, while A. Milhausenii inhabits water which is much\r\nsalter. They differ greatly in the form of the tail-lobes, and in the\r\npresence or absence of spines upon the tail, and had always been\r\nconsidered perfectly distinct species. Yet either was transformed into\r\nthe other in a few generations, during which the saltness of the water\r\nwas gradually altered. Yet more, A. salina was gradually accustomed to\r\nfresher water, and in the course of a few generations, when the water\r\nhad become perfectly fresh, the species was changed into Branchipus\r\nstagnalis, which had always been considered to belong to a different\r\ngenus on account of differences in the form of the antennae and of the\r\nposterior segments of the body (see Fig. 36). This certainly appears to\r\nbe a proof of change of conditions producing a change of form\r\nindependently of selection, and of that change of form, while remaining\r\nunder the same conditions, being inherited. Yet there is this\r\npeculiarity in the case, that there is a chemical change in the water,\r\nand that this water permeates the whole body, and must be absorbed by\r\nthe tissues, and thus affect the ova and even the reproductive\r\nelements, and in this way may profoundly modify the whole organisation.\r\nWhy and how the external effects are limited to special details of the\r\nstructure we do not know; but it does not seem as if any far-reaching\r\nconclusions as to the cumulative effect of external conditions on the\r\nhigher terrestrial animals and plants, can be drawn from such an\r\nexceptional phenomenon. It seems rather analogous to those effects of\r\nexternal influences on the very lowest organisms in which the vegetative\r\nand reproductive organs are hardly differentiated, in which case such\r\neffects are doubtless inherited.[208]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36. _a._ Branchipus stagnalis. _b._ Artemia salina.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Professor Geddes's Theory of Variation in Plants._\r\n\r\nIn a paper read before the Edinburgh Botanical Society in 1886 Mr.\r\nPatrick Geddes laid down the outlines of a fundamental theory of plant\r\nvariation, which he has further extended in the article \"Variation and\r\nSelection\" in the _Encydopaedia Britannica_, and in a paper read before\r\nthe Linnaean Society but not yet published.\r\n\r\nA theory of variation should deal alike with the origin of specific\r\ndistinctions and with those vaster differences which characterise the\r\nlarger groups, and he thinks it should answer such questions as--How an\r\naxis comes to be arrested to form a flower? how the various forms of\r\ninflorescence were evolved? how did perigynous or epigynous flowers\r\narise from hypogynous flowers? and many others equally fundamental.\r\nNatural selection acting upon numerous accidental variations will not,\r\nhe urges, account for such general facts as these, which must depend on\r\nsome constant law of variation. This law he believes to be the\r\nwell-known antagonism of vegetative and reproductive growth acting\r\nthroughout the whole course of plant development; and he uses it to\r\nexplain many of the most characteristic features of the structure of\r\nflowers and fruits.\r\n\r\nCommencing with the origin of the flower, which all botanists agree in\r\nregarding as a shortened branch, he explains this shortening as an\r\ninevitable physiological fact, since the cost of the development of the\r\nreproductive elements is so great as necessarily to check vegetative\r\ngrowth. In the same manner the shortening of the inflorescence from\r\nraceme to spike or umbel, and thence to the capitulum or dense\r\nflower-head of the composite plants is brought about. This shortening,\r\ncarried still further, produces the flattened leaf-like receptacle of\r\nDorstenia, and further still the deeply hollowed fruity receptacle of\r\nthe fig.\r\n\r\nThe flower itself undergoes a parallel modification due to a similar\r\ncause. It is formed by a series of modified leaves arranged round a\r\nshortened axis. In its earlier stages the number of these modified\r\nleaves is indefinite, as in many Ranunculaceae; and the axis itself is\r\nnot greatly shortened, as in Myosurus. The first advance is to a\r\ndefinite number of parts and a permanently shortened axis, in the\r\narrangement termed hypogynous, in which all the whorls are quite\r\ndistinct from each other. In the next stage there is a further\r\nshortening of the central axis, leaving the outer portion as a ring on\r\nwhich the petals are inserted, producing the arrangement termed\r\nperigynous. A still further advance is made by the contraction of the\r\naxis, so as to leave the central part forming the ovary quite below the\r\nflower, which is then termed epigynous.\r\n\r\nThese several modifications are said to be parallel and definite, and to\r\nbe determined by the continuous checking of vegetation by reproduction\r\nalong what is an absolute groove of progressive change. This being the\r\ncase, the importance of natural selection is greatly diminished. Instead\r\nof selecting and accumulating spontaneous indefinite variations, its\r\nfunction is to retard them after the stage of maximum utility has been\r\nindependently reached. The same simple conception is said to unlock\r\ninnumerable problems of vegetable morphology, large and small alike. It\r\nexplains the inevitable development of gymnosperm into angiosperm by the\r\nchecked vegetative growth of the ovule-bearing leaf or carpel; while\r\nsuch minor adaptations as the splitting fruit of the geranium or the\r\ncupped stigma of the pansy, can be no longer looked upon as achievements\r\nof natural selection, but must be regarded as naturally traceable to\r\nthe vegetative checking of their respective types of leaf organ. Again,\r\na detailed examination of spiny plants practically excludes the\r\nhypothesis of mammalian selection altogether, and shows spines to arise\r\nas an expression of the diminishing vegetativeness--in fact, the ebbing\r\nvitality of a species.[209]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Objections to the Theory._\r\n\r\nThe theory here sketched out is enticing, and at first sight seems\r\ncalculated to throw much light on the history of plant development; but\r\non further consideration, it seems wanting in definiteness, while it is\r\nbeset with difficulties at every step. Take first the shortening of the\r\nraceme into the umbel and the capitulum, said to be caused by arrest of\r\nvegetative growth, due to the antagonism of reproduction. If this were\r\nthe whole explanation of the phenomenon, we should expect the quantity\r\nof seed to increase as this vegetative growth diminished, since the seed\r\nis the product of the reproductive energy of the plant, and its quantity\r\nthe best measure of that energy. But is this the case? The ranunculus\r\nhas comparatively few seeds, and the flowers are not numerous; while in\r\nthe same order the larkspur and the columbine have far more seeds as\r\nwell as more flowers, but there is no shortening of the raceme or\r\ndiminution of the foliage, although the flowers are large and complex.\r\nSo, the extremely shortened and compressed flower-heads of the\r\ncompositae produce comparatively few seeds--one only to each flower;\r\nwhile the foxglove, with its long spike of showy flowers, produces an\r\nenormous number.\r\n\r\nAgain, if the shortening of the central axis in the successive stages of\r\nhypogynous, perigynous, and epigynous flowers were an indication of\r\npreponderant reproduction and diminished vegetation, we should find\r\neverywhere some clear indications of this fact. The plants with\r\nhypogynous flowers should, as a rule, have less seed and more vigorous\r\nand abundant foliage than those at the other extreme with epigynous\r\nflowers. But the hypogynous poppies, pinks, and St. John's worts have\r\nabundance of seed and rather scanty foliage; while the epigynous\r\ndogwoods and honeysuckles have few seeds and abundant foliage. If,\r\ninstead of the number of the seeds, we take the size of the fruit as an\r\nindication of reproductive energy, we find this at a maximum in the\r\ngourd family, yet their rapid and luxuriant growth shows no diminution\r\nof vegetative power. So that the statement that plant modifications\r\nproceed \"along an absolute groove of progressive change\" is contradicted\r\nby innumerable facts indicating advance and regression, improvement or\r\ndegradation, according as the ever-changing environment renders one form\r\nmore advantageous than the other. As one instance I may mention the\r\nAnonaceae or custard-apple tribe, which are certainly an advance from\r\nthe Ranunculaceae; yet in the genus Polyalthea the fruit consists of a\r\nnumber of separate carpels, each borne on a long stalk, as if reverting\r\nto the primitive stalked carpellary leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the Origin of Spines._\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most extraordinary application of the theory is that\r\nwhich considers spines to be an indication of the \"ebbing vitality of a\r\nspecies,\" and which excludes \"mammalian selection altogether.\" If this\r\nwere true, spines should occur mainly in feeble, rare, and dying-out\r\nspecies, instead of which we have the hawthorn, one of our most vigorous\r\nshrubs or trees, with abundant vitality and an extensive range over the\r\nwhole Palaearctic region, showing that it is really a dominant species.\r\nIn North America the numerous thorny species of Crataegus are equally\r\nvigorous, as are the false acacia (Robinia) and the honey-locust\r\n(Gleditschia). Neither have the numerous species of very spiny Acacias\r\nbeen noticed to be rarer or less vigorous than the unarmed kinds.\r\n\r\nOn the other point--that spines are not due to mammalian selection--we\r\nare able to adduce what must be considered direct and conclusive\r\nevidence. For if spines, admittedly produced by aborted branches,\r\npetioles, or peduncles, are due solely or mainly to diminished\r\nvegetativeness or ebbing vitality, they ought to occur in all countries\r\nalike, or at all events in all whose similar conditions tend to check\r\nvegetation; whereas, if they are, solely or mainly, developed as a\r\nprotection against the attacks of herbivorous mammals, they ought to be\r\nmost abundant where these are plentiful, and rare or absent where\r\nindigenous mammalia are wanting. Oceanic islands, as compared with\r\ncontinents, would thus furnish a crucial test of the two theories; and\r\nMr. Hemsley of Kew, who has specially studied insular floras, has given\r\nme some valuable information on this point. He says: \"There are no spiny\r\nor prickly plants in the indigenous element of the St. Helena flora. The\r\nrelatively rich flora of the Sandwich Isles is not absolutely without a\r\nprickly plant, but almost so. All the endemic genera are unarmed, and\r\nthe endemic species of almost every other genus. Even such genera as\r\nZanthoxylon, Acacia, Xylosoma, Lycium, and Solanum, of which there are\r\nmany armed species in other countries, are only represented by unarmed\r\nspecies. The two endemic Rubi have the prickles reduced to the setaceous\r\ncondition, and the two palms are unarmed.\r\n\r\n\"The flora of the Galapagos includes a number of prickly plants, among\r\nthem several cacti (these have not been investigated and may be American\r\nspecies), but I do not think one of the known endemic species of any\r\nfamily is prickly or spiny.\r\n\r\n\"Spiny and prickly plants are also rare in New Zealand, but there are\r\nthe formidably armed species of wild Spaniard (Aciphylla), one species\r\nof Rubus, the pungent-leaved Epacrideae and a few others.\"\r\n\r\nMr. J.G. Baker of Kew, who has specially studied the flora of Mauritius\r\nand the adjacent islands, also writes me on this point. He says: \"Taking\r\nMauritius alone, I do not call to mind a single species that is a\r\nspinose endemic tree or shrub. If you take the whole group of islands\r\n(Mauritius, Bourbon, Seychelles, and Rodriguez), there will be about a\r\ndozen species, but then nine of these are palms. Leaving out palms, the\r\ntrees and shrubs of that part of the world are exceptionally\r\nnon-spinose.\"\r\n\r\nThese are certainly remarkable facts, and quite inexplicable on the\r\ntheory of spines being caused solely by checked vegetative growth, due\r\nto weakness of constitution or to an arid soil and climate. For the\r\nGalapagos and many parts of the Sandwich Islands are very arid, as is a\r\nconsiderable part of the North Island of New Zealand. Yet in our own\r\nmoist climate and with our very limited number of trees and shrubs we\r\nhave about eighteen spiny or prickly species, more, apparently, than in\r\nthe whole endemic floras of the Mauritius, Sandwich Islands, and\r\nGalapagos, though these are all especially rich in shrubby and arboreal\r\nspecies. In New Zealand the prickly Rubus is a leafless trailing plant,\r\nand its prickles are probably a protection against the large snails of\r\nthe country, several of which have shells from two to three and a half\r\ninches long.[210] The \"wild Spaniards\" are very spiny herbaceous\r\nUmbelliferae, and may have gained their spines to preserve them from\r\nbeing trodden down or eaten by the Moas, which, for countless ages, took\r\nthe place of mammals in New Zealand. The exact use or meaning of the\r\nspines in palms is more doubtful, though they are, no doubt, protective\r\nagainst some animals; but it is certainly an extraordinary fact that in\r\nthe entire flora of the Mauritius, so largely consisting of trees and\r\nshrubs, not a single endemic species should be thorny or spiny.\r\n\r\nIf now we consider that every continental flora produces a considerable\r\nproportion of spiny and thorny species, and that these rise to a maximum\r\nin South Africa, where herbivorous mammalia were (before the settlement\r\nof the country), perhaps, more abundant and varied than in any other\r\npart of the world; while another district, remarkable for well-armed\r\nvegetation, is Chile, where the camel-like vicugnas, llamas, and\r\nalpacas, and an abundance of large rodents wage perpetual war against\r\nshrubby vegetation, we shall see the full significance of the almost\r\ntotal absence of thorny and spiny plants in the chief oceanic islands;\r\nand so far from \"excluding the hypothesis of mammalian selection\r\naltogether,\" we shall find in this hypothesis the only satisfactory\r\nexplanation of the facts.\r\n\r\nFrom the brief consideration of Professor Geddes's theory now given, we\r\nconclude that, although the antagonism between vegetative and\r\nreproductive growth is a real agency, and must be taken account of in\r\nour endeavour to explain many of the fundamental facts in the structure\r\nand form of plants, yet it is so overpowered and directed at every step\r\nby the natural selection of favourable variations, that the results of\r\nits exclusive and unmodified action are nowhere to be found in nature.\r\nIt may be allowed to rank as one of those \"laws of growth,\" of which so\r\nmany have now been indicated, and which were always recognised by Darwin\r\nas underlying all variation; but unless we bear in mind that its action\r\nmust always be subordinated to natural selection, and that it is\r\ncontinually checked, or diverted, or even reversed by the necessity of\r\nadaptation to the environment, we shall be liable to fall into such\r\nglaring errors as the imputing to \"ebbing vitality\" alone such a\r\nwidespread phenomenon as the occurrence of spines and thorns, while\r\nignoring altogether the influence of the organic environment in their\r\nproduction.[211]\r\n\r\nThe sketch now given of the chief attempts that have been made to prove\r\nthat either the direct action of the environment or certain fundamental\r\nlaws of variation are independent causes of modification of species,\r\nshows us that their authors have, in every case, failed to establish\r\ntheir contention. Any direct action of the environment, or any\r\ncharacters acquired by use or disuse, can have no effect whatever upon\r\nthe race unless they are inherited; and that they are inherited in any\r\ncase, except when they directly affect the reproductive cells, has not\r\nbeen proved. On the other hand, as we shall presently show, there is\r\nmuch reason for believing that such acquired characters are in their\r\nnature non-heritable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Variation and Selection Overpower the Effects of Use and Disuse._\r\n\r\nBut there is another objection to this theory arising from the very\r\nnature of the effects produced. In each generation the effects of use or\r\ndisuse, or of effort, will certainly be very small, while of this small\r\neffect it is not maintained that the whole will be always inherited by\r\nthe next generation. How small the effect is we have no means of\r\ndetermining, except in the case of disuse, which Mr. Darwin investigated\r\ncarefully. He found that in twelve fancy breeds of pigeons, which are\r\noften kept in aviaries, or if free fly but little, the sternum had been\r\nreduced by about one-seventh or one-eighth of its entire length, and\r\nthat of the scapula about one-ninth. In domestic ducks the weight of the\r\nwing-bones in proportion to that of the whole skeleton had decreased\r\nabout one-tenth. In domestic rabbits the bones of the legs were found to\r\nhave increased in weight in due proportion to the increased weight of\r\nthe body, but those of the hind legs were rather less in proportion to\r\nthose of the fore legs than in the wild animal, a difference which may\r\nbe imputed to their being less used in rapid motion. The pigeons,\r\ntherefore, afford the greatest amount of reduction by\r\ndisuse--one-seventh of the length of the sternum. But the pigeon has\r\ncertainly been domesticated four or five thousand years; and if the\r\nreduction of the wings by disuse has only been going on for the last\r\nthousand years, the amount of reduction in each generation would be\r\nabsolutely imperceptible, and quite within the limits of the reduction\r\ndue to the absence of selection, as already explained. But, as we have\r\nseen in Chapter III, the fortuitous variation of every part or organ\r\nusually amounts to one-tenth, and often to one-sixth of the average\r\ndimensions--that is, the fortuitous variation in one generation among a\r\nlimited number of the individuals of a species is as great as the\r\ncumulative effects of disuse in a thousand generations! If we assume\r\nthat the effects of use or of effort in the individual are equal to the\r\neffects of disuse, or even ten or a hundred times greater, they will\r\neven then not equal, in each generation, the amount of the fortuitous\r\nvariations of the same part. If it be urged that the effects of use\r\nwould modify all the individuals of a species, while the fortuitous\r\nvariations to the amount named only apply to a portion of them, it may\r\nbe replied, that that portion is sufficiently large to afford ample\r\nmaterials for selection, since it often equals the numbers that can\r\nannually survive; while the recurrence in each successive generation of\r\na like amount of variation would render possible such a rapid adjustment\r\nto new conditions that the effects of use or disuse would be as nothing\r\nin comparison. It follows, that even admitting the modifying effects of\r\nthe environment, and that such modifications are inherited, they would\r\nyet be entirely swamped by the greater effects of fortuitous variation,\r\nand the far more rapid cumulative results of the selection of such\r\nvariations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Supposed Action of the Environment in Initiating Variations._\r\n\r\nIt is, however, urged that the reaction of the environment initiates\r\nvariations, which without it would never arise; such, for instance, as\r\nthe origin of horns through the pressures and irritations caused by\r\nbutting, or otherwise using the head as a weapon or for defence.\r\nAdmitting, for the sake of argument, that this is so, all the evidence\r\nwe possess shows that, from the very first appearance of the rudiment of\r\nsuch an organ, it would vary to a greater extent than the amount of\r\ngrowth directly produced by use; and these variations would be subject\r\nto selection, and would thus modify the organ in ways which use alone\r\nwould never bring about. We have seen that this has been the case with\r\nthe branching antlers of the stag, which have been modified by\r\nselection, so as to become useful in other ways than as a mere weapon;\r\nand the same has almost certainly been the case with the variously\r\ncurved and twisted horns of antelopes. In like manner, every conceivable\r\nrudiment would, from its first appearance, be subject to the law of\r\nvariation and selection, to which, thenceforth, the direct effect of the\r\nenvironment would be altogether subordinate.\r\n\r\nA very similar mode of reasoning will apply to the other branch of the\r\nsubject--the initiation of structures and organs by the action of the\r\nfundamental laws of growth. Admitting that such laws have determined\r\nsome of the main divisions of the animal and vegetable kingdom, have\r\noriginated certain important organs, and have been the fundamental cause\r\nof certain lines of development, yet at every step of the process these\r\nlaws must have acted in entire subordination to the law of natural\r\nselection. No modification thus initiated could have advanced a single\r\nstep, unless it were, on the whole, a useful modification; while its\r\nentire future course would be necessarily subject to the laws of\r\nvariation and selection, by which it would be sometimes checked,\r\nsometimes hastened on, sometimes diverted to one purpose, sometimes to\r\nanother, according as the needs of the organism, under the special\r\nconditions of its existence, required such modification. We need not\r\ndeny that such laws and influences may have acted in the manner\r\nsuggested, but what we do deny is that they could possibly escape from\r\nthe ever-present and all-powerful modifying effects of variation and\r\nnatural selection.[212]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Weismann's Theory of Heredity._\r\n\r\nProfessor August Weismann has put forth a new theory of heredity founded\r\nupon the \"continuity of the germ-plasm,\" one of the logical consequences\r\nof which is, that acquired characters of whatever kind are not\r\ntransmitted from parent to offspring. As this is a matter of vital\r\nimportance to the theory of natural selection, and as, if well founded,\r\nit strikes away the foundations of most of the theories discussed in the\r\npresent chapter, a brief outline of Weismann's views must be attempted,\r\nalthough it is very difficult to make them intelligible to persons\r\nunfamiliar with the main facts of modern embryology.[213]\r\n\r\nThe problem is thus stated by Weismann: \"How is it that in the case of\r\nall higher animals and plants a single cell is able to separate itself\r\nfrom amongst the millions of most various kinds of which an organism is\r\ncomposed, and by division and complicated differentiation to reconstruct\r\na new individual with marvellous likeness, unchanged in many cases even\r\nthroughout whole geological periods?\" Darwin attempted to solve the\r\nproblem by his theory of \"Pangenesis,\" which supposed that every\r\nindividual cell in the body gave off gemmules or germs capable of\r\nreproducing themselves, and that portions of these germs of each of the\r\nalmost infinite number of cells permeate the whole body and become\r\ncollected in the generative cells, and are thus able to reproduce the\r\nwhole organism. This theory is felt to be so ponderously complex and\r\ndifficult that it has met with no general acceptance among\r\nphysiologists.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the germ-cells _do_ reproduce with wonderful accuracy not\r\nonly the general characters of the species, but many of the individual\r\ncharacteristics of the parents or more remote ancestors, and that this\r\nprocess is continued from generation to generation, can be accounted\r\nfor, Weismann thinks, only on two suppositions which are physiologically\r\npossible. Either the substance of the parent germ-cell, after passing\r\nthrough a cycle of changes required for the construction of a new\r\nindividual, possesses the capability of producing anew germ-cells\r\nidentical with those from which that individual was developed, or _the\r\nnew germ-cells arise, as far as their essential and characteristic\r\nsubstance is concerned, not at all out of the body of the individual,\r\nbut direct from the parent germ-cell_. This latter view Weismann holds\r\nto be the correct one, and, on this theory, heredity depends on the fact\r\nthat a substance of special molecular composition passes over from one\r\ngeneration to another. This is the \"germ-plasm,\" the power of which to\r\ndevelop itself into a perfect organism depends on the extraordinary\r\ncomplication of its minutest structure. At every new birth a portion of\r\nthe specific germ-plasm, which the parent egg-cell contains, is not used\r\nup in producing the offspring, but is reserved unchanged to produce the\r\ngerm-cells of the following generation. Thus the germ-cells--so far as\r\nregards their essential part the germ-plasm--are not a product of the\r\nbody itself, but are related to one another in the same way as are a\r\nseries of generations of unicellular organisms derived from one another\r\nby a continuous course of simple division. Thus the question of heredity\r\nis reduced to one of growth. A minute portion of the very same\r\ngerm-plasm from which, first the germ-cell, and then the whole organism\r\nof the parent, were developed, becomes the starting-point of the growth\r\nof the child.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cause of Variation._\r\n\r\nBut if this were all, the offspring would reproduce the parent exactly,\r\nin every detail of form and structure; and here we see the importance of\r\nsex, for each new germ grows out of the united germ-plasms of two\r\nparents, whence arises a mingling of their characters in the offspring.\r\nThis occurs in each generation; hence every individual is a complex\r\nresult reproducing in ever-varying degrees the diverse characteristics\r\nof his two parents, four grandparents, eight great-grandparents, and\r\nother more remote ancestors; and that ever-present individual variation\r\narises which furnishes the material for natural selection to act upon.\r\nDiversity of sex becomes, therefore, of primary importance as _the cause\r\nof variation_. Where asexual generation prevails, the characteristics of\r\nthe individual alone are reproduced, and there are thus no means of\r\neffecting the change of form or structure required by changed conditions\r\nof existence. Under such changed conditions a complex organism, if only\r\nasexually propagated, would become extinct. But when a complex organism\r\nis sexually propagated, there is an ever-present cause of change which,\r\nthough slight in any one generation, is cumulative, and under the\r\ninfluence of selection is sufficient to keep up the harmony between the\r\norganism and its slowly changing environment.[214]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Non-Heredity of Acquired Characters._\r\n\r\nCertain observations on the embryology of the lower animals are held to\r\nafford direct proof of this theory of heredity, but they are too\r\ntechnical to be made clear to ordinary readers. A logical result of the\r\ntheory is the impossibility of the transmission of acquired characters,\r\nsince the molecular structure of the germ-plasm is already determined\r\nwithin the embryo; and Weismann holds that there are no facts which\r\nreally prove that acquired characters can be inherited, although their\r\ninheritance has, by most writers, been considered so probable as hardly\r\nto stand in need of direct proof.\r\n\r\nWe have already shown, in the earlier part of this chapter, that many\r\ninstances of change, imputed to the inheritance of acquired variations,\r\nare really cases of selection; while the very fact that _use_ implies\r\n_usefulness_ renders it almost impossible to eliminate the action of\r\nselection in a state of nature. As regards mutilations, it is generally\r\nadmitted that they are not hereditary, and there is ample evidence on\r\nthis point. When it was the fashion to dock horses' tails, it was not\r\nfound that horses were born with short tails; nor are Chinese women born\r\nwith distorted feet; nor are any of the numerous forms of racial\r\nmutilation in man, which have in some cases been carried on for hundreds\r\nof generations, inherited. Nevertheless, a few cases of apparent\r\ninheritance of mutilations have been recorded,[215] and these, if\r\ntrustworthy, are difficulties in the way of the theory. The undoubted\r\ninheritance of disease is hardly a difficulty, because the\r\npredisposition to disease is a congenital, not an acquired character,\r\nand as such would be the subject of inheritance. The often-quoted case\r\nof a disease induced by mutilation being inherited (Brown-Sequard's\r\nepileptic guinea-pigs) has been discussed by Professor Weismann, and\r\nshown to be not conclusive. The mutilation itself--a section of certain\r\nnerves--was never inherited, but the resulting epilepsy, or a general\r\nstate of weakness, deformity, or sores, was sometimes inherited. It is,\r\nhowever, possible that the mere injury introduced and encouraged the\r\ngrowth of certain microbes, which, spreading through the organism,\r\nsometimes reached the germ-cells, and thus transmitted a diseased\r\ncondition to the offspring. Such a transference of microbes is believed\r\nto occur in syphilis and tuberculosis, and has been ascertained to occur\r\nin the case of the muscardine silkworm disease.[216]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Theory of Instinct._\r\n\r\nThe theory now briefly outlined cannot be said to be proved, but it\r\ncommends itself to many physiologists as being inherently probable, and\r\nas furnishing a good working hypothesis till displaced by a better. We\r\ncannot, therefore, accept any arguments against the agency of natural\r\nselection which are based upon the opposite and equally unproved theory\r\nthat acquired characters are inherited; and as this applies to the whole\r\nschool of what may be termed Neo-Lamarckians, their speculations cease\r\nto have any weight.\r\n\r\nThe same remark applies to the popular theory of instincts as being\r\ninherited habits; though Darwin gave very little weight to this, but\r\nderived almost all instincts from spontaneous useful variations which,\r\nlike other spontaneous variations, are of course inherited. At first\r\nsight it appears as if the acquired habits of our trained\r\ndogs--pointers, retrievers, etc.--are certainly inherited; but this need\r\nnot be the case, because there must be some structural or psychical\r\npeculiarities, such as modifications in the attachments of muscles,\r\nincreased delicacy of smell or sight, or peculiar likes and dislikes,\r\nwhich are inherited; and from these, peculiar habits follow as a natural\r\nconsequence, or are easily acquired. Now, as selection has been\r\nconstantly at work in improving all our domestic animals, we have\r\nunconsciously modified the structure, while preserving only those\r\nanimals which best served our purpose in their peculiar faculties,\r\ninstincts, or habits.\r\n\r\nMuch of the mystery of instinct arises from the persistent refusal to\r\nrecognise the agency of imitation, memory, observation, and reason as\r\noften forming part of it. Yet there is ample evidence that such agency\r\nmust be taken into account. Both Wilson and Leroy state that young birds\r\nbuild inferior nests to old ones, and the latter author observes that\r\nthe best nests are made by birds whose young remain longest in the nest.\r\nSo, migration is now well ascertained to be effected by means of vision,\r\nlong flights being made on bright moonlight nights when the birds fly\r\nvery high, while on cloudy nights they fly low, and then often lose\r\ntheir way. Thousands annually fly out to sea and perish, showing that\r\nthe instinct to migrate is imperfect, and is not a good substitute for\r\nreason and observation.\r\n\r\nAgain, much of the perfection of instinct is due to the extreme severity\r\nof the selection during its development, any failure involving\r\ndestruction. The chick which cannot break the eggshell, the caterpillar\r\nthat fails to suspend itself properly or to spin a safe cocoon, the bees\r\nthat lose their way or that fail to store honey, inevitably perish. So\r\nthe birds that fail to feed and protect their young, or the butterflies\r\nthat lay their eggs on the wrong food-plant, leave no offspring, and the\r\nrace with imperfect instincts perishes. Now, during the long and very\r\nslow course of development of each organism, this rigid selection at\r\nevery step of progress has led to the preservation of every detail of\r\nstructure, faculty, or habit that has been necessary for the\r\npreservation of the race, and has thus gradually built up the various\r\ninstincts which seem so marvellous to us, but which can yet be shown to\r\nbe in many cases still imperfect. Here, as everywhere else in nature, we\r\nfind comparative, not absolute perfection, with every gradation from\r\nwhat is clearly due to imitation or reason up to what seems to us\r\nperfect instinct--that in which a complex action is performed without\r\nany previous experience or instruction.[217]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Concluding Remarks._\r\n\r\nHaving now passed in review the more important of the recent objections\r\nto, or criticisms of, the theory of natural selection, we have arrived\r\nat the conclusion that in no one case have the writers in question been\r\nable materially to diminish its importance, or to show that any of the\r\nlaws or forces to which they appeal can act otherwise than in strict\r\nsubordination to it. The direct action of the environment as set forth\r\nby Mr. Herbert Spencer, Dr. Cope, and Dr. Karl Semper, even if we admit\r\nthat its effects on the individual are transmitted by inheritance, are\r\nso small in comparison with the amount of spontaneous variation of every\r\npart of the organism that they must be quite overshadowed by the latter.\r\nAnd if such direct action may, in some cases, have initiated certain\r\norgans or outgrowths, these must from their very first beginnings have\r\nbeen subject to variation and natural selection, and their further\r\ndevelopment have been almost wholly due to these ever-present and\r\npowerful causes. The same remark applies to the views of Professor\r\nGeddes on the laws of growth which have determined certain essential\r\nfeatures in the morphology of plants and animals. The attempt to\r\nsubstitute these laws for those of variation and natural selection has\r\nfailed in cases where we can apply a definite test, as in that of the\r\norigin of spines on trees and shrubs; while the extreme diversity of\r\nvegetable structure and form among the plants of the same country and of\r\nthe same natural order, of itself affords a proof of the preponderating\r\ninfluence of variation and natural selection in keeping the many diverse\r\nforms in harmony with the highly complex and ever-changing environment.\r\n\r\nLastly, we have seen that Professor Weismann's theory of the continuity\r\nof the germ-plasm and the consequent non-heredity of acquired\r\ncharacters, while in perfect harmony with all the well-ascertained facts\r\nof heredity and development, adds greatly to the importance of natural\r\nselection as the one invariable and ever-present factor in all organic\r\nchange, and that which can alone have produced the temporary fixity\r\ncombined with the secular modification of species. While admitting, as\r\nDarwin always admitted, the co-operation of the fundamental laws of\r\ngrowth and variation, of correlation and heredity, in determining the\r\ndirection of lines of variation or in the initiation of peculiar organs,\r\nwe find that variation and natural selection are ever-present agencies,\r\nwhich take possession, as it were, of every minute change originated by\r\nthese fundamental causes, check or favour their further development, or\r\nmodify them in countless varied ways according to the varying needs of\r\nthe organism. Whatever other causes have been at work, Natural Selection\r\nis supreme, to an extent which even Darwin himself hesitated to claim\r\nfor it. The more we study it the more we are convinced of its\r\noverpowering importance, and the more confidently we claim, in Darwin's\r\nown words, that it \"has been the most important, but not the exclusive,\r\nmeans of modification.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 198: See the Duke of Argyll's letter in _Nature_, vol. xxxiv.\r\np. 336.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 199: _Journal of the Anthropological Institute,_ vol. xv. pp.\r\n246-260.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 200: The idea of the non-heredity of acquired variations was\r\nsuggested by the summary of Professor Weismann's views, in _Nature_,\r\nreferred to later on. But since this chapter was written I have, through\r\nthe kindness of Mr. E.B. Poulton, seen some of the proofs of the\r\nforthcoming translation of Weismann's Essays on Heredity, in which he\r\nsets forth an explanation very similar to that here given. On the\r\ndifficult question of the almost entire disappearance of organs, as in\r\nthe limbs of snakes and of some lizards, he adduces \"a certain form of\r\ncorrelation, which Roux calls 'the struggle of the parts in the\r\norganism,'\" as playing an important part. Atrophy following disuse is\r\nnearly always attended by the corresponding increase of other organs:\r\nblind animals possess more developed organs of touch, hearing, and\r\nsmell; the loss of power in the wings is accompanied by increased\r\nstrength of the legs, etc. Now as these latter characters, being useful,\r\nwill be selected, it is easy to understand that a congenital increase of\r\nthese will be accompanied by a corresponding congenital diminution of\r\nthe unused organ; and in cases where the means of nutrition are\r\ndeficient, every diminution of these useless parts will be a gain to the\r\nwhole organism, and thus their complete disappearance will, in some\r\ncases, be brought about directly by natural selection. This corresponds\r\nwith what we know of these rudimentary organs.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be pointed out that the non-heredity of acquired\r\ncharacters was maintained by Mr. Francis Galton more than twelve years\r\nago, on theoretical considerations almost identical with those urged by\r\nProfessor Weismann; while the insufficiency of the evidence for their\r\nhereditary transmission was shown, by similar arguments to those used\r\nabove and in the work of Professor Weismann already referred to (see \"A\r\nTheory of Heredity,\" in _Journ. Anthrop. Instit._, vol. v. pp.\r\n343-345).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 201: This explanation is derived from Weismann's Theory of the\r\nContinuity of the Germ-Plasm as summarised in _Nature_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 202: See a collection of his essays under the title, _The\r\nOrigin of the Fittest: Essays on Evolution_, D.

In this way, he thinks, may possibly be explained the\r\nclimatic varieties of certain butterflies, and some other changes which\r\nseem to be effected by change of climate in a few generations.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 209: This brief indication of Professor Geddes's views is\r\ntaken from the article \"Variation and Selection\" in the _Encyclopedia\r\nBritannica_, and a paper \"On the Nature and Causes of Variation in\r\nPlants\" in _Trans. and Proc. of the Edinburgh Botanical Society_, 1886;\r\nand is, for the most part, expressed in his own words.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 210: Placostylis bovinus, 3½ inches long; Paryphanta Busbyi, 3\r\nin. diam.; P.

Henslow's theory of the origin of\r\nthe various forms and structures of flowers as due to \"the responsive\r\nactions of the protoplasm in consequence of the irritations set up by\r\nthe weights, pressures, thrusts, tensions, etc., of the insect visitors\"\r\n(_The Origin of Floral Structures through Insect and other Agencies_, p.\r\n340). On the assumption that acquired characters are inherited, such\r\nirritations may have had something to do with the initiation of\r\nvariations and with the production of certain details of structure, but\r\nthey are clearly incompetent to have brought about the more important\r\nstructural and functional modifications of flowers. Such are, the\r\nvarious adjustments of length and position of the stamens to bring the\r\npollen to the insect and from the insect to the stigma; the various\r\nmotions of stamens and styles at the right time and the right direction;\r\nthe physiological adjustments bringing about fertility or sterility in\r\nheterostyled plants; the traps, springs, and complex movements of\r\nvarious parts of orchids; and innumerable other remarkable phenomena.\r\n\r\nFor the explanation of these we have no resource but variation and\r\nselection, to the effects of which, acting alternately with regression\r\nor degradation as above explained (p. 328) must be imputed the\r\ndevelopment of the countless floral structures we now behold. Even the\r\nprimitive flowers, whose initiation may, perhaps, have been caused, or\r\nrendered possible, by the irritation set up by insects' visits, must,\r\nfrom their very origin, have been modified, in accordance with the\r\nsupreme law of utility, by means of variation and survival of the\r\nfittest.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 212: In an essay on \"The Duration of Life,\" forming part of\r\nthe translation of Dr. Weismann's papers already referred to, the author\r\nstill further extends the sphere of natural selection by showing that\r\nthe average duration of life in each species has been determined by it.\r\nA certain length of life is essential in order that the species may\r\nproduce offspring sufficient to ensure its continuance under the most\r\nunfavourable conditions; and it is shown that the remarkable\r\ninequalities of longevity in different species and groups may be thus\r\naccounted for. Yet more, the occurrence of death in the higher\r\norganisms, in place of the continued survival of the unicellular\r\norganisms however much they may increase by subdivision, may be traced\r\nto the same great law of utility for the race and survival of the\r\nfittest. The whole essay is of exceeding interest, and will repay a\r\ncareful perusal. A similar idea occurred to the present writer about\r\ntwenty years back, and was briefly noted down at the time, but\r\nsubsequently forgotten.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 213: The outline here given is derived from two articles in\r\n_Nature_, vol. xxxiii. p. 154, and vol. xxxiv. p. 629, in which\r\nWeismann's papers are summarised and partly translated.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 214: There are many indications that this explanation of the\r\ncause of variation is the true one. Mr. E.B. Poulton suggests one, in\r\nthe fact that parthenogenetic reproduction only occurs in isolated\r\nspecies, not in groups of related species; as this shows that\r\nparthenogenesis cannot lead to the evolution of new forms. Again, in\r\nparthenogenetic females the complete apparatus for fertilisation remains\r\nunreduced; but if these varied as do sexually produced animals, the\r\norgans referred to, being unused, would become rudimentary.\r\n\r\nEven more important is the significance of the \"polar bodies,\" as\r\nexplained by Weismann in one of his _Essays_; since, if his\r\ninterpretation of them be correct, variability is a necessary\r\nconsequence of sexual generation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 215: Darwin's _Animals and Plants_, vol. ii. pp. 23, 24.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 216: In his essay on \"Heredity,\" Dr. Weismann discusses many\r\nother cases of supposed inheritance of acquired characters, and shows\r\nthat they can all be explained in other ways. Shortsightedness among\r\ncivilised nations, for example, is due partly to the absence of\r\nselection and consequent regression towards a mean, and partly to its\r\nindividual production by constant reading.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 217: Weismann explains instinct on similar lines, and gives\r\nmany interesting illustrations (see _Essays on Heredity_). He holds\r\n\"that all instinct is entirely due to the operation of natural\r\nselection, and has its foundation, not upon inherited experiences, but\r\nupon variations of the germ.\" Many interesting and difficult cases of\r\ninstinct are discussed by Darwin in Chapter VIII of the _Origin of\r\nSpecies_, which should be read in connection with the above remarks.\r\n\r\nSince this chapter was written my attention has been directed to Mr.\r\nFrancis Galton's _Theory of Heredity_ (already referred to at p. 417)\r\nwhich was published thirteen years ago as an alternative for Darwin's\r\ntheory of pangenesis.\r\n\r\nMr. Galton's theory, although it attracted little attention, appears to\r\nme to be substantially the same as that of Professor Weismann. Galton's\r\n\"stirp\" is Weismann's \"germ-plasm.\" Galton supposes the sexual elements\r\nin the offspring to be directly formed from the residue of the _stirp_\r\nnot used up in the development of the body of the parent--Weismann's\r\n\"continuity of the germ-plasm.\" Galton also draws many of the same\r\nconclusions from his theory. He maintains that characters acquired by\r\nthe individual as the result of external influences cannot be inherited,\r\nunless such influences act directly on the reproductive\r\nelements--instancing the possible heredity of alcoholism, because the\r\nalcohol permeates the tissues and may reach the sexual elements. He\r\ndiscusses the supposed heredity of effects produced by use or disuse,\r\nand explains them much in the same manner as does Weismann. Galton is an\r\nanthropologist, and applies the theory, mainly, to explain the\r\npeculiarities of hereditary transmission in man, many of which\r\npeculiarities he discusses and elucidates. Weismann is a biologist, and\r\nis mostly concerned with the application of the theory to explain\r\nvariation and instinct, and to the further development of the theory of\r\nevolution. He has worked it out more thoroughly, and has adduced\r\nembryological evidence in its support; but the views of both writers are\r\nsubstantially the same, and their theories were arrived at quite\r\nindependently. The names of Galton and Weismann should therefore be\r\nassociated as discoverers of what may be considered (if finally\r\nestablished) the most important contribution to the evolution theory\r\nsince the appearance of the _Origin of Species_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nDARWINISM APPLIED TO MAN\r\n\r\n\r\n    General identity of human and animal structure--Rudiments and\r\n    variations showing relation of man to other mammals--The\r\n    embryonic development of man and other mammalia--Diseases common\r\n    to man and the lower animals--The animals most nearly allied to\r\n    man--The brains of man and apes--External differences of man and\r\n    apes--Summary of the animal characteristics of man--The\r\n    geological antiquity of man--The probable birthplace of man--The\r\n    origin of the moral and intellectual nature of man--The argument\r\n    from continuity--The origin of the mathematical faculty--The\r\n    origin of the musical and artistic faculties--Independent proof\r\n    that these faculties have not been developed by natural\r\n    selection--The interpretation of the facts--Concluding remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur review of modern Darwinism might fitly have terminated with the\r\npreceding chapter; but the immense interest that attaches to the origin\r\nof the human race, and the amount of misconception which prevails\r\nregarding the essential teachings of Darwin's theory on this question,\r\nas well as regarding my own special views upon it, induce me to devote a\r\nfinal chapter to its discussion.\r\n\r\nTo any one who considers the structure of man's body, even in the most\r\nsuperficial manner, it must be evident that it is the body of an animal,\r\ndiffering greatly, it is true, from the bodies of all other animals, but\r\nagreeing with them in all essential features. The bony structure of man\r\nclasses him as a vertebrate; the mode of suckling his young classes him\r\nas a mammal; his blood, his muscles, and his nerves, the structure of\r\nhis heart with its veins and arteries, his lungs and his whole\r\nrespiratory and circulatory systems, all closely correspond to those of\r\nother mammals, and are often almost identical with them. He possesses\r\nthe same number of limbs terminating in the same number of digits as\r\nbelong fundamentally to the mammalian class. His senses are identical\r\nwith theirs, and his organs of sense are the same in number and occupy\r\nthe same relative position. Every detail of structure which is common to\r\nthe mammalia as a class is found also in man, while he only differs from\r\nthem in such ways and degrees as the various species or groups of\r\nmammals differ from each other. If, then, we have good reason to believe\r\nthat every existing group of mammalia has descended from some common\r\nancestral form--as we saw to be so completely demonstrated in the case\r\nof the horse tribe,--and that each family, each order, and even the\r\nwhole class must similarly have descended from some much more ancient\r\nand more generalised type, it would be in the highest degree\r\nimprobable--so improbable as to be almost inconceivable--that man,\r\nagreeing with them so closely in every detail of his structure, should\r\nhave had some quite distinct mode of origin. Let us, then, see what\r\nother evidence bears upon the question, and whether it is sufficient to\r\nconvert the probability of his animal origin into a practical certainty.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rudiments and Variations as Indicating the Relation of Man to other\r\nMammals._\r\n\r\nAll the higher animals present rudiments of organs which, though useless\r\nto them, are useful in some allied group, and are believed to have\r\ndescended from a common ancestor in which they were useful. Thus there\r\nare in ruminants rudiments of incisor teeth which, in some species,\r\nnever cut through the gums; many lizards have external rudimentary legs;\r\nwhile many birds, as the Apteryx, have quite rudimentary wings. Now man\r\npossesses similar rudiments, sometimes constantly, sometimes only\r\noccasionally present, which serve intimately to connect his bodily\r\nstructure with that of the lower animals. Many animals, for example,\r\nhave a special muscle for moving or twitching the skin. In man there are\r\nremnants of this in certain parts of the body, especially in the\r\nforehead, enabling us to raise our eyebrows; but some persons have it in\r\nother parts. A few persons are able to move the whole scalp so as to\r\nthrow off any object placed on the head, and this property has been\r\nproved, in one case, to be inherited. In the outer fold of the ear there\r\nis sometimes a projecting point, corresponding in position to the\r\npointed ear of many animals, and believed to be a rudiment of it. In the\r\nalimentary canal there is a rudiment--the vermiform appendage of the\r\ncaecum--which is not only useless, but is sometimes a cause of disease\r\nand death in man; yet in many vegetable feeding animals it is very long,\r\nand even in the orang-utan it is of considerable length and convoluted.\r\nSo, man possesses rudimentary bones of a tail concealed beneath the\r\nskin, and, in some rare cases, this forms a minute external tail.\r\n\r\nThe variability of every part of man's structure is very great, and many\r\nof these variations tend to approximate towards the structure of other\r\nanimals. The courses of the arteries are eminently variable, so that for\r\nsurgical purposes it has been necessary to determine the probable\r\nproportion of each variation. The muscles are so variable that in fifty\r\ncases the muscles of the foot were found to be not strictly alike in any\r\ntwo, and in some the deviations were considerable; while in thirty-six\r\nsubjects Mr. J. Wood observed no fewer than 558 muscular variations. The\r\nsame author states that in a single male subject there were no fewer\r\nthan seven muscular variations, all of which plainly represented muscles\r\nproper to various kinds of apes. The muscles of the hands and\r\narms--parts which are so eminently characteristic of man--are extremely\r\nliable to vary, so as to resemble the corresponding muscles of the lower\r\nanimals. That such variations are due to reversion to a former state of\r\nexistence Mr. Darwin thinks highly probable, and he adds: \"It is quite\r\nincredible that a man should, through mere accident, abnormally resemble\r\ncertain apes in no less than seven of his muscles, if there had been no\r\ngenetic connection between them. On the other hand, if man is descended\r\nfrom some ape-like creature, no valid reason can be assigned why certain\r\nmuscles should not suddenly reappear after an interval of many thousand\r\ngenerations, in the same manner as, with horses, asses, and mules, dark\r\ncoloured stripes suddenly reappear on the legs and shoulders, after an\r\ninterval of hundreds, or more probably of thousands of\r\ngenerations.\"[218]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Embryonic Development of Man and other Mammalia._\r\n\r\nThe progressive development of any vertebrate from the ovum or minute\r\nembryonic egg affords one of the most marvellous chapters in Natural\r\nHistory. We see the contents of the ovum undergoing numerous definite\r\nchanges, its interior dividing and subdividing till it consists of a\r\nmass of cells, then a groove appears marking out the median line or\r\nvertebral column of the future animal, and thereafter are slowly\r\ndeveloped the various essential organs of the body. After describing in\r\nsome detail what takes place in the case of the ovum of the dog,\r\nProfessor Huxley continues: \"The history of the development of any other\r\nvertebrate animal, lizard, snake, frog, or fish tells the same story.\r\nThere is always to begin with, an egg having the same essential\r\nstructure as that of the dog; the yelk of that egg undergoes division or\r\nsegmentation, as it is called, the ultimate products of that\r\nsegmentation constitute the building materials for the body of the young\r\nanimal; and this is built up round a primitive groove, in the floor of\r\nwhich a notochord is developed. Furthermore, there is a period in which\r\nthe young of all these animals resemble one another, not merely in\r\noutward form, but in all essentials of structure, so closely, that the\r\ndifferences between them are inconsiderable, while in their subsequent\r\ncourse they diverge more and more widely from one another. And it is a\r\ngeneral law that the more closely any animals resemble one another in\r\nadult structure, the larger and the more intimately do their embryos\r\nresemble one another; so that, for example, the embryos of a snake and\r\nof a lizard remain like one another longer than do those of a snake and\r\na bird; and the embryos of a dog and of a cat remain like one another\r\nfor a far longer period than do those of a dog and a bird, or of a dog\r\nand an opossum, or even than those of a dog and a monkey.\"[219]\r\n\r\nWe thus see that the study of development affords a test of affinity in\r\nanimals that are externally very much unlike each other; and we\r\nnaturally ask how this applies to man. Is he developed in a different\r\nway from other mammals, as we should certainly expect if he has had a\r\ndistinct and altogether different origin? \"The reply,\" says Professor\r\nHuxley, \"is not doubtful for a moment. Without question, the mode of\r\norigin and the early stages of the development of man are identical with\r\nthose of the animals immediately below him in the scale.\" And again he\r\ntells us: \"It is very long before the body of the young human being can\r\nbe readily discriminated from that of the young puppy; but at a\r\ntolerably early period the two become distinguishable by the different\r\nforms of their adjuncts, the yelk-sac and the allantois;\" and after\r\ndescribing these differences he continues: \"But exactly in those\r\nrespects in which the developing man differs from the dog, he resembles\r\nthe ape.... So that it is only quite in the latter stages of development\r\nthat the young human being presents marked differences from the young\r\nape, while the latter departs as much from the dog in its development as\r\nthe man does. Startling as this last assertion may appear to be, it is\r\ndemonstrably true, and it alone appears to me sufficient to place beyond\r\nall doubt the structural unity of man with the rest of the animal world,\r\nand more particularly and closely with the apes.\"[220]\r\n\r\nA few of the curious details in which man passes through stages common\r\nto the lower animals may be mentioned. At one stage the os coccyx\r\nprojects like a true tail, extending considerably beyond the rudimentary\r\nlegs. In the seventh month the convolutions of the brain resemble those\r\nof an adult baboon. The great toe, so characteristic of man, forming the\r\nfulcrum which most assists him in standing erect, in an early stage of\r\nthe embryo is much shorter than the other toes, and instead of being\r\nparallel with them, projects at an angle from the side of the foot, thus\r\ncorresponding with its permanent condition in the quadrumana. Numerous\r\nother examples might be quoted, all illustrating the same general law.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Diseases Common to Man and the Lower Animals._\r\n\r\nThough the fact is so well known, it is certainly one of profound\r\nsignificance that many animal diseases can be communicated to man, since\r\nit shows similarity, if not identity, in the minute structure of the\r\ntissues, the nature of the blood, the nerves, and the brain. Such\r\ndiseases as hydrophobia, variola, the glanders, cholera, herpes, etc.,\r\ncan be transmitted from animals to man or the reverse; while monkeys are\r\nliable to many of the same non-contagious diseases as we are. Rengger,\r\nwho carefully observed the common monkey (Cebus Azarae) in Paraguay,\r\nfound it liable to catarrh, with the usual symptoms, terminating\r\nsometimes in consumption. These monkeys also suffered from apoplexy,\r\ninflammation of the bowels, and cataract in the eye. Medicines produced\r\nthe same effect upon them as upon us. Many kinds of monkeys have a\r\nstrong taste for tea, coffee, spirits, and even tobacco. These facts\r\nshow the similarity of the nerves of taste in monkeys and in ourselves,\r\nand that their whole nervous system is affected in a similar way. Even\r\nthe parasites, both external and internal, that affect man are not\r\naltogether peculiar to him, but belong to the same families or genera as\r\nthose which infest animals, and in one case, scabies, even the same\r\nspecies.[221] These curious facts seem quite inconsistent with the idea\r\nthat man's bodily structure and nature are altogether distinct from\r\nthose of animals, and have had a different origin; while the facts are\r\njust what we should expect if he has been produced by descent with\r\nmodification from some common ancestor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Animals most nearly Allied to Man._\r\n\r\nBy universal consent we see in the monkey tribe a caricature of\r\nhumanity. Their faces, their hands, their actions and expressions\r\npresent ludicrous resemblances to our own. But there is one group of\r\nthis great tribe in which this resemblance is greatest, and they have\r\nhence been called the anthropoid or man-like apes. These are few in\r\nnumber, and inhabit only the equatorial regions of Africa and Asia,\r\ncountries where the climate is most uniform, the forests densest, and\r\nthe supply of fruit abundant throughout the year. These animals are now\r\ncomparatively well known, consisting of the orang-utan of Borneo and\r\nSumatra, the chimpanzee and the gorilla of West Africa, and the group of\r\ngibbons or long-armed apes, consisting of many species and inhabiting\r\nSouth-Eastern Asia and the larger Malay Islands. These last are far\r\nless like man than the other three, one or other of which has at various\r\ntimes been claimed to be the most man-like of the apes and our nearest\r\nrelations in the animal kingdom. The question of the degree of\r\nresemblance of these animals to ourselves is one of great interest,\r\nleading, as it does, to some important conclusions as to our origin and\r\ngeological antiquity, and we will therefore briefly consider it.\r\n\r\nIf we compare the skeletons of the orang or chimpanzee with that of man,\r\nwe find them to be a kind of distorted copy, every bone corresponding\r\n(with very few exceptions), but altered somewhat in size, proportions,\r\nand position. So great is this resemblance that it led Professor Owen to\r\nremark: \"I cannot shut my eyes to the significance of that all-pervading\r\nsimilitude of structure--every tooth, every bone, strictly\r\nhomologous--which makes the determination of the difference between\r\n_Homo_ and _Pithecus_ the anatomist's difficulty.\"\r\n\r\nThe actual differences in the skeletons of these apes and that of\r\nman--that is, differences dependent on the presence or absence of\r\ncertain bones, and not on their form or position--have been enumerated\r\nby Mr. Mivart as follows:--(1) In the breast-bone consisting of but two\r\nbones, man agrees with the gibbons; the chimpanzee and gorilla having\r\nthis part consisting of seven bones in a single series, while in the\r\norang they are arranged in a double series of ten bones. (2) The normal\r\nnumber of the ribs in the orang and some gibbons is twelve pairs, as in\r\nman, while in the chimpanzee and gorilla there are thirteen pairs. (3)\r\nThe orang and the gibbons also agree with man in having five lumbar\r\nvertebrae, while in the gorilla and the chimpanzee there are but four,\r\nand sometimes only three. (4) The gorilla and chimpanzee agree with man\r\nin having eight small bones in the wrist, while the orang and the\r\ngibbons, as well as all other monkeys, have nine.[222]\r\n\r\nThe differences in the form, size, and attachments of the various bones,\r\nmuscles, and other organs of these apes and man are very numerous and\r\nexceedingly complex, sometimes one species, sometimes another agreeing\r\nmost nearly with ourselves, thus presenting a tangled web of affinities\r\nwhich it is very difficult to unravel. Estimated by the skeleton alone,\r\nthe chimpanzee and gorilla seem nearer to man than the orang, which last\r\nis also inferior as presenting certain aberrations in the muscles. In\r\nthe form of the ear the gorilla is more human than any other ape, while\r\nin the tongue the orang is the more man-like. In the stomach and liver\r\nthe gibbons approach nearest to man, then come the orang and chimpanzee,\r\nwhile the gorilla has a degraded liver more resembling that of the lower\r\nmonkeys and baboons.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Brains of Man and Apes._\r\n\r\nWe come now to that part of his organisation in which man is so much\r\nhigher than all the lower animals--the brain; and here, Mr. Mivart\r\ninforms us, the orang stands highest in rank. The height of the orang's\r\ncerebrum in front is greater in proportion than in either the chimpanzee\r\nor the gorilla. \"On comparing the brain of man with the brains of the\r\norang, chimpanzee, and baboon, we find a successive decrease in the\r\nfrontal lobe, and a successive and very great increase in the relative\r\nsize of the occipital lobe. Concomitantly with this increase and\r\ndecrease, certain folds of brain substance, called 'bridging\r\nconvolutions,' which in man are conspicuously interposed between the\r\nparietal and occipital lobes, seem as utterly to disappear in the\r\nchimpanzee, as they do in the baboon. In the orang, however, though much\r\nreduced, they are still to be distinguished.... The actual and absolute\r\nmass of the brain is, however, slightly greater in the chimpanzee than\r\nin the orang, as is the relative vertical extent of the middle part of\r\nthe cerebrum, although, as already stated, the frontal portion is higher\r\nin the orang; while, according to M. Gratiolet, the gorilla is not only\r\ninferior to the orang in cerebral development, but even to his smaller\r\nAfrican congener, the chimpanzee.\"[223]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, we find that no one of the great apes can be\r\npositively asserted to be nearest to man in structure. Each of them\r\napproaches him in certain characteristics, while in others it is widely\r\nremoved, giving the idea, so consonant with the theory of evolution as\r\ndeveloped by Darwin, that all are derived from a common ancestor, from\r\nwhich the existing anthropoid apes as well as man have diverged. When,\r\nhowever, we turn from the details of anatomy to peculiarities of\r\nexternal form and motions, we find that, in a variety of characters, all\r\nthese apes resemble each other and differ from man, so that we may\r\nfairly say that, while they have diverged somewhat from each other, they\r\nhave diverged much more widely from ourselves. Let us briefly enumerate\r\nsome of these differences.\r\n\r\n\r\n_External Differences of Man and Apes._\r\n\r\nAll apes have large canine teeth, while in man these are no longer than\r\nthe adjacent incisors or premolars, the whole forming a perfectly even\r\nseries. In apes the arms are proportionately much longer than in man,\r\nwhile the thighs are much shorter. No ape stands really erect, a posture\r\nwhich is natural in man. The thumb is proportionately larger in man, and\r\nmore perfectly opposable than in that of any ape. The foot of man\r\ndiffers largely from that of all apes, in the horizontal sole, the\r\nprojecting heel, the short toes, and the powerful great toe firmly\r\nattached parallel to the other toes; all perfectly adapted for\r\nmaintaining the erect posture, and for free motion without any aid from\r\nthe arms or hands. In apes the foot is formed almost exactly like our\r\nhand, with a large thumb-like great toe quite free from the other toes,\r\nand so articulated as to be opposable to them; forming with the long\r\nfinger-like toes a perfect grasping hand. The sole cannot be placed\r\nhorizontally on the ground; but when standing on a level surface the\r\nanimal rests on the outer edge of the foot with the finger and\r\nthumb-like toes partly closed, while the hands are placed on the ground\r\nresting on the knuckles. The illustration on the next page (Fig. 37)\r\nshows, fairly well, the peculiarities of the hands and feet of the\r\nchimpanzee, and their marked differences, both in form and use, from\r\nthose of man.\r\n\r\nThe four limbs, with the peculiarly formed feet and hands, are those of\r\narboreal animals which only occasionally and awkwardly move on level\r\nground. The arms are used in progression equally with the feet, and the\r\nhands are only adapted for uses similar to those of our hands when the\r\nanimal is at rest, and then but clumsily. Lastly, the apes are all hairy\r\nanimals, like the majority of other mammals, man alone having a smooth\r\nand almost naked skin. These numerous and striking differences, even\r\nmore than those of the skeleton and internal anatomy, point to an\r\nenormously remote epoch when the race that was ultimately to develop\r\ninto man diverged from that other stock which continued the animal type\r\nand ultimately produced the existing varieties of anthropoid apes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--Chimpanzee (Troglodytes niger).]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Summary of the Animal Characteristics of Man._\r\n\r\nThe facts now very briefly summarised amount almost to a demonstration\r\nthat man, in his bodily structure, has been derived from the lower\r\nanimals, of which he is the culminating development. In his possession\r\nof rudimentary structures which are functional in some of the mammalia;\r\nin the numerous variations of his muscles and other organs agreeing with\r\ncharacters which are constant in some apes; in his embryonic\r\ndevelopment, absolutely identical in character with that of mammalia in\r\ngeneral, and closely resembling in its details that of the higher\r\nquadrumana; in the diseases which he has in common with other mammalia;\r\nand in the wonderful approximation of his skeleton to those of one or\r\nother of the anthropoid apes, we have an amount of evidence in this\r\ndirection which it seems impossible to explain away. And this evidence\r\nwill appear more forcible if we consider for a moment what the rejection\r\nof it implies. For the only alternative supposition is, that man has\r\nbeen specially created--that is to say, has been produced in some quite\r\ndifferent way from other animals and altogether independently of them.\r\nBut in that case the rudimentary structures, the animal-like variations,\r\nthe identical course of development, and all the other animal\r\ncharacteristics he possesses are deceptive, and inevitably lead us, as\r\nthinking beings making use of the reason which is our noblest and most\r\ndistinctive feature, into gross error.\r\n\r\nWe cannot believe, however, that a careful study of the facts of nature\r\nleads to conclusions directly opposed to the truth; and, as we seek in\r\nvain, in our physical structure and the course of its development, for\r\nany indication of an origin independent of the rest of the animal world,\r\nwe are compelled to reject the idea of \"special creation\" for man, as\r\nbeing entirely unsupported by facts as well as in the highest degree\r\nimprobable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Geological Antiquity of Man._\r\n\r\nThe evidence we now possess of the exact nature of the resemblance of\r\nman to the various species of anthropoid apes, shows us that he has\r\nlittle special affinity for any one rather than another species, while\r\nhe differs from them all in several important characters in which they\r\nagree with each other. The conclusion to be drawn from these facts is,\r\nthat his points of affinity connect him with the whole group, while his\r\nspecial peculiarities equally separate him from the whole group, and\r\nthat he must, therefore, have diverged from the common ancestral form\r\nbefore the existing types of anthropoid apes had diverged from each\r\nother. Now, this divergence almost certainly took place as early as the\r\nMiocene period, because in the Upper Miocene deposits of Western Europe\r\nremains of two species of ape have been found allied to the gibbons, one\r\nof them, Dryopithecus, nearly as large as a man, and believed by M.\r\nLartet to have approached man in its dentition more than the existing\r\napes. We seem hardly, therefore, to have reached, in the Upper Miocene,\r\nthe epoch of the common ancestor of man and the anthropoids.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of the antiquity of man himself is also scanty, and takes\r\nus but very little way back into the past. We have clear proof of his\r\nexistence in Europe in the latter stages of the glacial epoch, with many\r\nindications of his presence in interglacial or even pre-glacial times;\r\nwhile both the actual remains and the works of man found in the\r\nauriferous gravels of California deep under lava-flows of Pliocene age,\r\nshow that he existed in the New World at least as early as in the\r\nOld.[224] These earliest remains of man have been received with doubt,\r\nand even with ridicule, as if there were some extreme improbability in\r\nthem. But, in point of fact, the wonder is that human remains have not\r\nbeen found more frequently in pre-glacial deposits. Referring to the\r\nmost ancient fossil remains found in Europe--the Engis and Neanderthal\r\ncrania,--Professor Huxley makes the following weighty remark: \"In\r\nconclusion, I may say, that the fossil remains of Man hitherto\r\ndiscovered do not seem to me to take us appreciably nearer to that lower\r\npithecoid form, by the modification of which he has, probably, become\r\nwhat he is.\" The Californian remains and works of art, above referred\r\nto, give no indication of a specially low form of man; and it remains an\r\nunsolved problem why no traces of the long line of man's ancestors, back\r\nto the remote period when he first branched off from the pithecoid type,\r\nhave yet been discovered.\r\n\r\nIt has been objected by some writers--notably by Professor Boyd\r\nDawkins--that man did not probably exist in Pliocene times, because\r\nalmost all the known mammalia of that epoch are distinct species from\r\nthose now living on the earth, and that the same changes of the\r\nenvironment which led to the modification of other mammalian species\r\nwould also have led to a change in man. But this argument overlooks the\r\nfact that man differs essentially from all other mammals in this\r\nrespect, that whereas any important adaptation to new conditions can be\r\neffected in them only by a change in bodily structure, man is able to\r\nadapt himself to much greater changes of conditions by a mental\r\ndevelopment leading him to the use of fire, of tools, of clothing, of\r\nimproved dwellings, of nets and snares, and of agriculture. By the help\r\nof these, without any change whatever in his bodily structure, he has\r\nbeen able to spread over and occupy the whole earth; to dwell securely\r\nin forest, plain, or mountain; to inhabit alike the burning desert or\r\nthe arctic wastes; to cope with every kind of wild beast, and to provide\r\nhimself with food in districts where, as an animal trusting to nature's\r\nunaided productions, he would have starved.[225]\r\n\r\nIt follows, therefore, that from the time when the ancestral man first\r\nwalked erect, with hands freed from any active part in locomotion, and\r\nwhen his brain-power became sufficient to cause him to use his hands in\r\nmaking weapons and tools, houses and clothing, to use fire for cooking,\r\nand to plant seeds or roots to supply himself with stores of food, the\r\npower of natural selection would cease to act in producing modifications\r\nof his body, but would continuously advance his mind through the\r\ndevelopment of its organ, the brain. Hence man may have become truly\r\nman--the species, Homo sapiens--even in the Miocene period; and while\r\nall other mammals were becoming modified from age to age under the\r\ninfluence of ever-changing physical and biological conditions, he would\r\nbe advancing mainly in intelligence, but perhaps also in stature, and by\r\nthat advance alone would be able to maintain himself as the master of\r\nall other animals and as the most widespread occupier of the earth. It\r\nis quite in accordance with this view that we find the most pronounced\r\ndistinction between man and the anthropoid apes in the size and\r\ncomplexity of his brain. Thus, Professor Huxley tells us that \"it may be\r\ndoubted whether a healthy human adult brain ever weighed less than 31\r\nor 32 ounces, or that the heaviest gorilla brain has exceeded 20\r\nounces,\" although \"a full-grown gorilla is probably pretty nearly twice\r\nas heavy as a Bosjes man, or as many an European woman.\"[226] The\r\naverage human brain, however, weighs 48 or 49 ounces, and if we take the\r\naverage ape brain at only 2 ounces less than the very largest gorilla's\r\nbrain, or 18 ounces, we shall see better the enormous increase which has\r\ntaken place in the brain of man since the time when he branched off from\r\nthe apes; and this increase will be still greater if we consider that\r\nthe brains of apes, like those of all other mammals, have also increased\r\nfrom earlier to later geological times.\r\n\r\nIf these various considerations are taken into account, we must conclude\r\nthat the essential features of man's structure as compared with that of\r\napes--his erect posture and free hands--were acquired at a comparatively\r\nearly period, and were, in fact, the characteristics which gave him his\r\nsuperiority over other mammals, and started him on the line of\r\ndevelopment which has led to his conquest of the world. But during this\r\nlong and steady development of brain and intellect, mankind must have\r\ncontinuously increased in numbers and in the area which they\r\noccupied--they must have formed what Darwin terms a \"dominant race.\" For\r\nhad they been few in numbers and confined to a limited area, they could\r\nhardly have successfully struggled against the numerous fierce carnivora\r\nof that period, and against those adverse influences which led to the\r\nextinction of so many more powerful animals. A large population spread\r\nover an extensive area is also needed to supply an adequate number of\r\nbrain variations for man's progressive improvement. But this large\r\npopulation and long-continued development in a single line of advance\r\nrenders it the more difficult to account for the complete absence of\r\nhuman or pre-human remains in all those deposits which have furnished,\r\nin such rich abundance, the remains of other land animals. It is true\r\nthat the remains of apes are also very rare, and we may well suppose\r\nthat the superior intelligence of man led him to avoid that extensive\r\ndestruction by flood or in morass which seems to have often overwhelmed\r\nother animals. Yet, when we consider that, even in our own day, men are\r\nnot unfrequently overwhelmed by volcanic eruptions, as in Java and\r\nJapan, or carried away in vast numbers by floods, as in Bengal and\r\nChina, it seems impossible but that ample remains of Miocene and\r\nPliocene man do exist buried in the most recent layers of the earth's\r\ncrust, and that more extended research or some fortunate discovery will\r\nsome day bring them to light.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Probable Birthplace of Man._\r\n\r\nIt has usually been considered that the ancestral form of man originated\r\nin the tropics, where vegetation is most abundant and the climate most\r\nequable. But there are some important objections to this view. The\r\nanthropoid apes, as well as most of the monkey tribe, are essentially\r\narboreal in their structure, whereas the great distinctive character of\r\nman is his special adaptation to terrestrial locomotion. We can hardly\r\nsuppose, therefore, that he originated in a forest region, where fruits\r\nto be obtained by climbing are the chief vegetable food. It is more\r\nprobable that he began his existence on the open plains or high plateaux\r\nof the temperate or sub-tropical zone, where the seeds of indigenous\r\ncereals and numerous herbivora, rodents, and game-birds, with fishes and\r\nmolluscs in the lakes, rivers, and seas supplied him with an abundance\r\nof varied food. In such a region he would develop skill as a hunter,\r\ntrapper, or fisherman, and later as a herdsman and cultivator,--a\r\nsuccession of which we find indications in the palaeolithic and\r\nneolithic races of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn seeking to determine the particular areas in which his earliest\r\ntraces are likely to be found, we are restricted to some portion of the\r\nEastern hemisphere, where alone the anthropoid apes exist, or have\r\napparently ever existed.\r\n\r\nThere is good reason to believe, also, that Africa must be excluded,\r\nbecause it is known to have been separated from the northern continent\r\nin early tertiary times, and to have acquired its existing fauna of the\r\nhigher mammalia by a later union with that continent after the\r\nseparation from it of Madagascar, an island which has preserved for us a\r\nsample, as it were, of the early African mammalian fauna, from which not\r\nonly the anthropoid apes, but all the higher quadrumana are\r\nabsent.[227] There remains only the great Euro-Asiatic continent; and\r\nits enormous plateaux, extending from Persia right across Tibet and\r\nSiberia to Manchuria, afford an area, some part or other of which\r\nprobably offered suitable conditions, in late Miocene or early Pliocene\r\ntimes, for the development of ancestral man.\r\n\r\nIt is in this area that we still find that type of mankind--the\r\nMongolian--which retains a colour of the skin midway between the black\r\nor brown-black of the negro, and the ruddy or olive-white of the\r\nCaucasian types, a colour which still prevails over all Northern Asia,\r\nover the American continents, and over much of Polynesia. From this\r\nprimary tint arose, under the influence of varied conditions, and\r\nprobably in correlation with constitutional changes adapted to peculiar\r\nclimates, the varied tints which still exist among mankind. If the\r\nreasoning by which this conclusion is reached be sound, and all the\r\nearlier stages of man's development from an animal form occurred in the\r\narea now indicated, we can better understand how it is that we have as\r\nyet met with no traces of the missing links, or even of man's existence\r\nduring late tertiary times, because no part of the world is so entirely\r\nunexplored by the geologist as this very region. The area in question is\r\nsufficiently extensive and varied to admit of primeval man having\r\nattained to a considerable population, and having developed his full\r\nhuman characteristics, both physical and mental, before there was any\r\nneed for him to migrate beyond its limits. One of his earliest important\r\nmigrations was probably into Africa, where, spreading westward, he\r\nbecame modified in colour and hair in correlation with physiological\r\nchanges adapting him to the climate of the equatorial lowlands.\r\nSpreading north-westward into Europe the moist and cool climate led to a\r\nmodification of an opposite character, and thus may have arisen the\r\nthree great human types which still exist. Somewhat later, probably, he\r\nspread eastward into North-West America and soon scattered himself over\r\nthe whole continent; and all this may well have occurred in early or\r\nmiddle Pliocene times. Thereafter, at very long intervals, successive\r\nwaves of migration carried him into every part of the habitable world,\r\nand by conquest and intermixture led ultimately to that puzzling\r\ngradation of types which the ethnologist in vain seeks to unravel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Origin of the Moral and Intellectual Nature of Man._\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing discussion it will be seen that I fully accept Mr.\r\nDarwin's conclusion as to the essential identity of man's bodily\r\nstructure with that of the higher mammalia, and his descent from some\r\nancestral form common to man and the anthropoid apes. The evidence of\r\nsuch descent appears to me to be overwhelming and conclusive. Again, as\r\nto the cause and method of such descent and modification, we may admit,\r\nat all events provisionally, that the laws of variation and natural\r\nselection, acting through the struggle for existence and the continual\r\nneed of more perfect adaptation to the physical and biological\r\nenvironments, may have brought about, first that perfection of bodily\r\nstructure in which he is so far above all other animals, and in\r\nco-ordination with it the larger and more developed brain, by means of\r\nwhich he has been able to utilise that structure in the more and more\r\ncomplete subjection of the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms to his\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nBut this is only the beginning of Mr. Darwin's work, since he goes on to\r\ndiscuss the moral nature and mental faculties of man, and derives these\r\ntoo by gradual modification and development from the lower animals.\r\nAlthough, perhaps, nowhere distinctly formulated, his whole argument\r\ntends to the conclusion that man's entire nature and all his faculties,\r\nwhether moral, intellectual, or spiritual, have been derived from their\r\nrudiments in the lower animals, in the same manner and by the action of\r\nthe same general laws as his physical structure has been derived. As\r\nthis conclusion appears to me not to be supported by adequate evidence,\r\nand to be directly opposed to many well-ascertained facts, I propose to\r\ndevote a brief space to its discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Argument from Continuity._\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin's mode of argument consists in showing that the rudiments of\r\nmost, if not of all, the mental and moral faculties of man can be\r\ndetected in some animals. The manifestations of intelligence, amounting\r\nin some cases to distinct acts of reasoning, in many animals, are\r\nadduced as exhibiting in a much less degree the intelligence and reason\r\nof man. Instances of curiosity, imitation, attention, wonder, and memory\r\nare given; while examples are also adduced which may be interpreted as\r\nproving that animals exhibit kindness to their fellows, or manifest\r\npride, contempt, and shame. Some are said to have the rudiments of\r\nlanguage, because they utter several different sounds, each of which has\r\na definite meaning to their fellows or to their young; others the\r\nrudiments of arithmetic, because they seem to count and remember up to\r\nthree, four, or even five. A sense of beauty is imputed to them on\r\naccount of their own bright colours or the use of coloured objects in\r\ntheir nests; while dogs, cats, and horses are said to have imagination,\r\nbecause they appear to be disturbed by dreams. Even some distant\r\napproach to the rudiments of religion is said to be found in the deep\r\nlove and complete submission of a dog to his master.[228]\r\n\r\nTurning from animals to man, it is shown that in the lowest savages many\r\nof these faculties are very little advanced from the condition in which\r\nthey appear in the higher animals; while others, although fairly well\r\nexhibited, are yet greatly inferior to the point of development they\r\nhave reached in civilised races. In particular, the moral sense is said\r\nto have been developed from the social instincts of savages, and to\r\ndepend mainly on the enduring discomfort produced by any action which\r\nexcites the general disapproval of the tribe. Thus, every act of an\r\nindividual which is believed to be contrary to the interests of the\r\ntribe, excites its unvarying disapprobation and is held to be immoral;\r\nwhile every act, on the other hand, which is, as a rule, beneficial to\r\nthe tribe, is warmly and constantly approved, and is thus considered to\r\nbe right or moral. From the mental struggle, when an act that would\r\nbenefit self is injurious to the tribe, there arises conscience; and\r\nthus the social instincts are the foundation of the moral sense and of\r\nthe fundamental principles of morality.[229]\r\n\r\nThe question of the origin and nature of the moral sense and of\r\nconscience is far too vast and complex to be discussed here, and a\r\nreference to it has been introduced only to complete the sketch of Mr.\r\nDarwin's view of the continuity and gradual development of all human\r\nfaculties from the lower animals up to savages, and from savage up to\r\ncivilised man. The point to which I wish specially to call attention is,\r\nthat to prove continuity and the progressive development of the\r\nintellectual and moral faculties from animals to man, is not the same as\r\nproving that these faculties have been developed by natural selection;\r\nand this last is what Mr. Darwin has hardly attempted, although to\r\nsupport his theory it was absolutely essential to prove it. Because\r\nman's physical structure has been developed from an animal form by\r\nnatural selection, it does not necessarily follow that his mental\r\nnature, even though developed _pari passu_ with it, has been developed\r\nby the same causes only. To illustrate by a physical analogy. Upheaval\r\nand depression of land, combined with sub-aerial denudation by wind and\r\nfrost, rain and rivers, and marine denudation on coastlines, were long\r\nthought to account for all the modelling of the earth's surface not\r\ndirectly due to volcanic action; and in the early editions of Lyell's\r\n_Principles of Geology_ these are the sole causes appealed to. But when\r\nthe action of glaciers was studied and the recent occurrence of a\r\nglacial epoch demonstrated as a fact, many phenomena--such as moraines\r\nand other gravel deposits, boulder clay, erratic boulders, grooved and\r\nrounded rocks, and Alpine lake basins--were seen to be due to this\r\naltogether distinct cause. There was no breach of continuity, no sudden\r\ncatastrophe; the cold period came on and passed away in the most gradual\r\nmanner, and its effects often passed insensibly into those produced by\r\ndenudation or upheaval; yet none the less a new agency appeared at a\r\ndefinite time, and new effects were produced which, though continuous\r\nwith preceding effects, were not due to the same causes. It is not,\r\ntherefore, to be assumed, without proof or against independent evidence,\r\nthat the later stages of an apparently continuous development are\r\nnecessarily due to the same causes only as the earlier stages. Applying\r\nthis argument to the case of man's intellectual and moral nature, I\r\npropose to show that certain definite portions of it could not have been\r\ndeveloped by variation and natural selection alone, and that, therefore,\r\nsome other influence, law, or agency is required to account for them.\r\nIf this can be clearly shown for any one or more of the special\r\nfaculties of intellectual man, we shall be justified in assuming that\r\nthe same unknown cause or power may have had a much wider influence, and\r\nmay have profoundly influenced the whole course of his development.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Origin of the Mathematical Faculty._\r\n\r\nWe have ample evidence that, in all the lower races of man, what may be\r\ntermed the mathematical faculty is, either absent, or, if present, quite\r\nunexercised. The Bushmen and the Brazilian Wood-Indians are said not to\r\ncount beyond two. Many Australian tribes only have words for one and\r\ntwo, which are combined to make three, four, five, or six, beyond which\r\nthey do not count. The Damaras of South Africa only count to three; and\r\nMr. Galton gives a curious description of how one of them was hopelessly\r\npuzzled when he had sold two sheep for two sticks of tobacco each, and\r\nreceived four sticks in payment. He could only find out that he was\r\ncorrectly paid by taking two sticks and then giving one sheep, then\r\nreceiving two sticks more and giving the other sheep. Even the\r\ncomparatively intellectual Zulus can only count up to ten by using the\r\nhands and fingers. The Ahts of North-West America count in nearly the\r\nsame manner, and most of the tribes of South America are no further\r\nadvanced.[230] The Kaffirs have great herds of cattle, and if one is\r\nlost they miss it immediately, but this is not by counting, but by\r\nnoticing the absence of one they know; just as in a large family or a\r\nschool a boy is missed without going through the process of counting.\r\nSomewhat higher races, as the Esquimaux, can count up to twenty by using\r\nthe hands and the feet; and other races get even further than this by\r\nsaying \"one man\" for twenty, \"two men\" for forty, and so on, equivalent\r\nto our rural mode of reckoning by scores. From the fact that so many of\r\nthe existing savage races can only count to four or five, Sir John\r\nLubbock thinks it improbable that our earliest ancestors could have\r\ncounted as high as ten.[231]\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the more civilised races, we find the use of numbers\r\nand the art of counting greatly extended. Even the Tongas of the South\r\nSea islands are said to have been able to count as high as 100,000. But\r\nmere counting does not imply either the possession or the use of\r\nanything that can be really called the mathematical faculty, the\r\nexercise of which in any broad sense has only been possible since the\r\nintroduction of the decimal notation. The Greeks, the Romans, the\r\nEgyptians, the Jews, and the Chinese had all such cumbrous systems, that\r\nanything like a science of arithmetic, beyond very simple operations,\r\nwas impossible; and the Roman system, by which the year 1888 would be\r\nwritten MDCCCLXXXVIII, was that in common use in Europe down to the\r\nfourteenth or fifteenth centuries, and even much later in some places.\r\nAlgebra, which was invented by the Hindoos, from whom also came the\r\ndecimal notation, was not introduced into Europe till the thirteenth\r\ncentury, although the Greeks had some acquaintance with it; and it\r\nreached Western Europe from Italy only in the sixteenth century.[232] It\r\nwas, no doubt, owing to the absence of a sound system of numeration that\r\nthe mathematical talent of the Greeks was directed chiefly to geometry,\r\nin which science Euclid, Archimedes, and others made such brilliant\r\ndiscoveries. It is, however, during the last three centuries only that\r\nthe civilised world appears to have become conscious of the possession\r\nof a marvellous faculty which, when supplied with the necessary tools in\r\nthe decimal notation, the elements of algebra and geometry, and the\r\npower of rapidly communicating discoveries and ideas by the art of\r\nprinting, has developed to an extent, the full grandeur of which can be\r\nappreciated only by those who have devoted some time (even if\r\nunsuccessfully) to the study.\r\n\r\nThe facts now set forth as to the almost total absence of mathematical\r\nfaculty in savages and its wonderful development in quite recent times,\r\nare exceedingly suggestive, and in regard to them we are limited to two\r\npossible theories. Either prehistoric and savage man did not possess\r\nthis faculty at all (or only in its merest rudiments); or they did\r\npossess it, but had neither the means nor the incitements for its\r\nexercise. In the former case we have to ask by what means has this\r\nfaculty been so rapidly developed in all civilised races, many of which\r\na few centuries back were, in this respect, almost savages themselves;\r\nwhile in the latter case the difficulty is still greater, for we have to\r\nassume the existence of a faculty which had never been used either by\r\nthe supposed possessors of it or by their ancestors.\r\n\r\nLet us take, then, the least difficult supposition--that savages\r\npossessed only the mere rudiments of the faculty, such as their ability\r\nto count, sometimes up to ten, but with an utter inability to perform\r\nthe very simplest processes of arithmetic or of geometry--and inquire\r\nhow this rudimentary faculty became rapidly developed into that of a\r\nNewton, a La Place, a Gauss, or a Cayley. We will admit that there is\r\nevery possible gradation between these extremes, and that there has been\r\nperfect continuity in the development of the faculty; but we ask, What\r\nmotive power caused its development?\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered we are here dealing solely with the capability of\r\nthe Darwinian theory to account for the origin of the _mind_, as well as\r\nit accounts for the origin of the _body_ of man, and we must, therefore,\r\nrecall the essential features of that theory. These are, the\r\npreservation of useful variations in the struggle for life; that no\r\ncreature can be improved beyond its necessities for the time being; that\r\nthe law acts by life and death, and by the survival of the fittest. We\r\nhave to ask, therefore, what relation the successive stages of\r\nimprovement of the mathematical faculty had to the life or death of its\r\npossessors; to the struggles of tribe with tribe, or nation with nation;\r\nor to the ultimate survival of one race and the extinction of another.\r\nIf it cannot possibly have had any such effects, then it cannot have\r\nbeen produced by natural selection.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that in the struggles of savage man with the elements and\r\nwith wild beasts, or of tribe with tribe, this faculty can have had no\r\ninfluence. It had nothing to do with the early migrations of man, or\r\nwith the conquest and extermination of weaker by more powerful peoples.\r\nThe Greeks did not successfully resist the Persian invaders by any aid\r\nfrom their few mathematicians, but by military training, patriotism, and\r\nself-sacrifice. The barbarous conquerors of the East, Timurlane and\r\nGengkhis Khan, did not owe their success to any superiority of intellect\r\nor of mathematical faculty in themselves or their followers. Even if the\r\ngreat conquests of the Romans were, in part, due to their systematic\r\nmilitary organisation, and to their skill in making roads and\r\nencampments, which may, perhaps, be imputed to some exercise of the\r\nmathematical faculty, that did not prevent them from being conquered in\r\nturn by barbarians, in whom it was almost entirely absent. And if we\r\ntake the most civilised peoples of the ancient world--the Hindoos, the\r\nArabs, the Greeks, and the Romans, all of whom had some amount of\r\nmathematical talent--we find that it is not these, but the descendants\r\nof the barbarians of those days--the Celts, the Teutons, and the\r\nSlavs--who have proved themselves the fittest to survive in the great\r\nstruggle of races, although we cannot trace their steadily growing\r\nsuccess during past centuries either to the possession of any\r\nexceptional mathematical faculty or to its exercise. They have indeed\r\nproved themselves, to-day, to be possessed of a marvellous endowment of\r\nthe mathematical faculty; but their success at home and abroad, as\r\ncolonists or as conquerors, as individuals or as nations, can in no way\r\nbe traced to this faculty, since they were almost the last who devoted\r\nthemselves to its exercise. We conclude, then, that the present gigantic\r\ndevelopment of the mathematical faculty is wholly unexplained by the\r\ntheory of natural selection, and must be due to some altogether distinct\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Origin of the Musical and Artistic Faculties._\r\n\r\nThese distinctively human faculties follow very closely the lines of the\r\nmathematical faculty in their progressive development, and serve to\r\nenforce the same argument. Among the lower savages music, as we\r\nunderstand it, hardly exists, though they all delight in rude musical\r\nsounds, as of drums, tom-toms, or gongs; and they also sing in\r\nmonotonous chants. Almost exactly as they advance in general intellect,\r\nand in the arts of social life, their appreciation of music appears to\r\nrise in proportion; and we find among them rude stringed instruments and\r\nwhistles, till, in Java, we have regular bands of skilled performers\r\nprobably the successors of Hindoo musicians of the age before the\r\nMahometan conquest. The Egyptians are believed to have been the earliest\r\nmusicians, and from them the Jews and the Greeks, no doubt, derived\r\ntheir knowledge of the art; but it seems to be admitted that neither the\r\nlatter nor the Romans knew anything of harmony or of the essential\r\nfeatures of modern music.[233] Till the fifteenth century little\r\nprogress appears to have been made in the science or the practice of\r\nmusic; but since that era it has advanced with marvellous rapidity, its\r\nprogress being curiously parallel with that of mathematics, inasmuch as\r\ngreat musical geniuses appeared suddenly among different nations, equal\r\nin their possession of this special faculty to any that have since\r\narisen.\r\n\r\nAs with the mathematical, so with the musical faculty, it is impossible\r\nto trace any connection between its possession and survival in the\r\nstruggle for existence. It seems to have arisen as a _result_ of social\r\nand intellectual advancement, not as a _cause_; and there is some\r\nevidence that it is latent in the lower races, since under European\r\ntraining native military bands have been formed in many parts of the\r\nworld, which have been able to perform creditably the best modern music.\r\n\r\nThe artistic faculty has run a somewhat different course, though\r\nanalogous to that of the faculties already discussed. Most savages\r\nexhibit some rudiments of it, either in drawing or carving human or\r\nanimal figures; but, almost without exception, these figures are rude\r\nand such as would be executed by the ordinary inartistic child. In fact,\r\nmodern savages are, in this respect hardly equal to those prehistoric\r\nmen who represented the mammoth and the reindeer on pieces of horn or\r\nbone. With any advance in the arts of social life, we have a\r\ncorresponding advance in artistic skill and taste, rising very high in\r\nthe art of Japan and India, but culminating in the marvellous sculpture\r\nof the best period of Grecian history. In the Middle Ages art was\r\nchiefly manifested in ecclesiastical architecture and the illumination\r\nof manuscripts, but from the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries\r\npictorial art revived in Italy and attained to a degree of perfection\r\nwhich has never been surpassed. This revival was followed closely by the\r\nschools of Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, France, and England, showing\r\nthat the true artistic faculty belonged to no one nation, but was fairly\r\ndistributed among the various European races.\r\n\r\nThese several developments of the artistic faculty, whether manifested\r\nin sculpture, painting, or architecture, are evidently outgrowths of the\r\nhuman intellect which have no immediate influence on the survival of\r\nindividuals or of tribes, or on the success of nations in their\r\nstruggles for supremacy or for existence. The glorious art of Greece did\r\nnot prevent the nation from falling under the sway of the less advanced\r\nRoman; while we ourselves, among whom art was the latest to arise, have\r\ntaken the lead in the colonisation of the world, thus proving our mixed\r\nrace to be the fittest to survive.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Independent Proof that the Mathematical, Musical, and Artistic\r\nFaculties have not been Developed under the Law of Natural Selection._\r\n\r\nThe law of Natural Selection or the survival of the fittest is, as its\r\nname implies, a rigid law, which acts by the life or death of the\r\nindividuals submitted to its action. From its very nature it can act\r\nonly on useful or hurtful characteristics, eliminating the latter and\r\nkeeping up the former to a fairly general level of efficiency. Hence it\r\nnecessarily follows that the characters developed by its means will be\r\npresent in all the individuals of a species, and, though varying, will\r\nnot vary very widely from a common standard. The amount of variation we\r\nfound, in our third chapter, to be about one-fifth or one-sixth of the\r\nmean value--that is, if the mean value were taken at 100, the variations\r\nwould reach from 80 to 120, or somewhat more, if very large numbers were\r\ncompared. In accordance with this law we find, that all those characters\r\nin man which were certainly essential to him during his early stages of\r\ndevelopment, exist in all savages with some approach to equality. In the\r\nspeed of running, in bodily strength, in skill with weapons, in\r\nacuteness of vision, or in power of following a trail, all are fairly\r\nproficient, and the differences of endowment do not probably exceed the\r\nlimits of variation in animals above referred to. So, in animal instinct\r\nor intelligence, we find the same general level of development. Every\r\nwren makes a fairly good nest like its fellows; every fox has an average\r\namount of the sagacity of its race; while all the higher birds and\r\nmammals have the necessary affections and instincts needful for the\r\nprotection and bringing-up of their offspring.\r\n\r\nBut in those specially developed faculties of civilised man which we\r\nhave been considering, the case is very different. They exist only in a\r\nsmall proportion of individuals, while the difference of capacity\r\nbetween these favoured individuals and the average of mankind is\r\nenormous. Taking first the mathematical faculty, probably fewer than one\r\nin a hundred really possess it, the great bulk of the population having\r\nno natural ability for the study, or feeling the slightest interest in\r\nit.[234] And if we attempt to measure the amount of variation in the\r\nfaculty itself between a first-class mathematician and the ordinary run\r\nof people who find any kind of calculation confusing and altogether\r\ndevoid of interest, it is probable that the former could not be\r\nestimated at less than a hundred times the latter, and perhaps a\r\nthousand times would more nearly measure the difference between them.\r\n\r\nThe artistic faculty appears to agree pretty closely with the\r\nmathematical in its frequency. The boys and girls who, going beyond the\r\nmere conventional designs of children, draw what they _see_, not what\r\nthey _know_ to be the shape of things; who naturally sketch in\r\nperspective, because it is thus they see objects; who see, and represent\r\nin their sketches, the light and shade as well as the mere outlines of\r\nobjects; and who can draw recognisable sketches of every one they know,\r\nare certainly very few compared with those who are totally incapable of\r\nanything of the kind. From some inquiries I have made in schools, and\r\nfrom my own observation, I believe that those who are endowed with this\r\nnatural artistic talent do not exceed, even if they come up to, one per\r\ncent of the whole population.\r\n\r\nThe variations in the amount of artistic faculty are certainly very\r\ngreat, even if we do not take the extremes. The gradations of power\r\nbetween the ordinary man or woman \"who does not draw,\" and whose\r\nattempts at representing any object, animate or inanimate, would be\r\nlaughable, and the average good artist who, with a few bold strokes, can\r\nproduce a recognisable and even effective sketch of a landscape, a\r\nstreet, or an animal, are very numerous; and we can hardly measure the\r\ndifference between them at less than fifty or a hundred fold.\r\n\r\nThe musical faculty is undoubtedly, in its lower forms, less uncommon\r\nthan either of the preceding, but it still differs essentially from the\r\nnecessary or useful faculties in that it is almost entirely wanting in\r\none-half even of civilised men. For every person who draws, as it were\r\ninstinctively, there are probably five or ten who sing or play without\r\nhaving been taught and from mere innate love and perception of melody\r\nand harmony.[235] On the other hand, there are probably about as many\r\nwho seem absolutely deficient in musical perception, who take little\r\npleasure in it, who cannot perceive discords or remember tunes, and who\r\ncould not learn to sing or play with any amount of study. The\r\ngradations, too, are here quite as great as in mathematics or pictorial\r\nart, and the special faculty of the great musical composer must be\r\nreckoned many hundreds or perhaps thousands of times greater than that\r\nof the ordinary \"unmusical\" person above referred to.\r\n\r\nIt appears then, that, both on account of the limited number of persons\r\ngifted with the mathematical, the artistic, or the musical faculty, as\r\nwell as from the enormous variations in its development, these mental\r\npowers differ widely from those which are essential to man, and are, for\r\nthe most part, common to him and the lower animals; and that they could\r\nnot, therefore, possibly have been developed in him by means of the law\r\nof natural selection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have thus shown, by two distinct lines of argument, that faculties\r\nare developed in civilised man which, both in their mode of origin,\r\ntheir function, and their variations, are altogether distinct from those\r\nother characters and faculties which are essential to him, and which\r\nhave been brought to their actual state of efficiency by the necessities\r\nof his existence. And besides the three which have been specially\r\nreferred to, there are others which evidently belong to the same class.\r\nSuch is the metaphysical faculty, which enables us to form abstract\r\nconceptions of a kind the most remote from all practical applications,\r\nto discuss the ultimate causes of things, the nature and qualities of\r\nmatter, motion, and force, of space and time, of cause and effect, of\r\nwill and conscience. Speculations on these abstract and difficult\r\nquestions are impossible to savages, who seem to have no mental faculty\r\nenabling them to grasp the essential ideas or conceptions; yet whenever\r\nany race attains to civilisation, and comprises a body of people who,\r\nwhether as priests or philosophers, are relieved from the necessity of\r\nlabour or of taking an active part in war or government, the\r\nmetaphysical faculty appears to spring suddenly into existence,\r\nalthough, like the other faculties we have referred to, it is always\r\nconfined to a very limited proportion of the population.\r\n\r\nIn the same class we may place the peculiar faculty of wit and humour,\r\nan altogether natural gift whose development appears to be parallel with\r\nthat of the other exceptional faculties. Like them, it is almost unknown\r\namong savages, but appears more or less frequently as civilisation\r\nadvances and the interests of life become more numerous and more\r\ncomplex. Like them, too, it is altogether removed from utility in the\r\nstruggle for life, and appears sporadically in a very small percentage\r\nof the population; the majority being, as is well known, totally unable\r\nto say a witty thing or make a pun even to save their lives.[236]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Interpretation of the Facts._\r\n\r\nThe facts now set forth prove the existence of a number of mental\r\nfaculties which either do not exist at all or exist in a very\r\nrudimentary condition in savages, but appear almost suddenly and in\r\nperfect development in the higher civilised races. These same faculties\r\nare further distinguished by their sporadic character, being well\r\ndeveloped only in a very small proportion of the community; and by the\r\nenormous amount of variation in their development, the higher\r\nmanifestations of them being many times--perhaps a hundred or a thousand\r\ntimes--stronger than the lower. Each of these characteristics is totally\r\ninconsistent with any action of the law of natural selection in the\r\nproduction of the faculties referred to; and the facts, taken in their\r\nentirety, compel us to recognise some origin for them wholly distinct\r\nfrom that which has served to account for the animal\r\ncharacteristics--whether bodily or mental--of man.\r\n\r\nThe special faculties we have been discussing clearly point to the\r\nexistence in man of something which he has not derived from his animal\r\nprogenitors--something which we may best refer to as being of a\r\nspiritual essence or nature, capable of progressive development under\r\nfavourable conditions. On the hypothesis of this spiritual nature,\r\nsuperadded to the animal nature of man, we are able to understand much\r\nthat is otherwise mysterious or unintelligible in regard to him,\r\nespecially the enormous influence of ideas, principles, and beliefs over\r\nhis whole life and actions. Thus alone we can understand the constancy\r\nof the martyr, the unselfishness of the philanthropist, the devotion of\r\nthe patriot, the enthusiasm of the artist, and the resolute and\r\npersevering search of the scientific worker after nature's secrets. Thus\r\nwe may perceive that the love of truth, the delight in beauty, the\r\npassion for justice, and the thrill of exultation with which we hear of\r\nany act of courageous self-sacrifice, are the workings within us of a\r\nhigher nature which has not been developed by means of the struggle for\r\nmaterial existence.\r\n\r\nIt will, no doubt, be urged that the admitted continuity of man's\r\nprogress from the brute does not admit of the introduction of new\r\ncauses, and that we have no evidence of the sudden change of nature\r\nwhich such introduction would bring about. The fallacy as to new causes\r\ninvolving any breach of continuity, or any sudden or abrupt change, in\r\nthe effects, has already been shown; but we will further point out that\r\nthere are at least three stages in the development of the organic world\r\nwhen some new cause or power must necessarily have come into action.\r\n\r\nThe first stage is the change from inorganic to organic, when the\r\nearliest vegetable cell, or the living protoplasm out of which it arose,\r\nfirst appeared. This is often imputed to a mere increase of complexity\r\nof chemical compounds; but increase of complexity, with consequent\r\ninstability, even if we admit that it may have produced protoplasm as a\r\nchemical compound, could certainly not have produced _living_\r\nprotoplasm--protoplasm which has the power of growth and of\r\nreproduction, and of that continuous process of development which has\r\nresulted in the marvellous variety and complex organisation of the whole\r\nvegetable kingdom. There is in all this something quite beyond and\r\napart from chemical changes, however complex; and it has been well said\r\nthat the first vegetable cell was a new thing in the world, possessing\r\naltogether new powers--that of extracting and fixing carbon from the\r\ncarbon-dioxide of the atmosphere, that of indefinite reproduction, and,\r\nstill more marvellous, the power of variation and of reproducing those\r\nvariations till endless complications of structure and varieties of form\r\nhave been the result. Here, then, we have indications of a new power at\r\nwork, which we may term _vitality_, since it gives to certain forms of\r\nmatter all those characters and properties which constitute Life.\r\n\r\nThe next stage is still more marvellous, still more completely beyond\r\nall possibility of explanation by matter, its laws and forces. It is the\r\nintroduction of sensation or consciousness, constituting the fundamental\r\ndistinction between the animal and vegetable kingdoms. Here all idea of\r\nmere complication of structure producing the result is out of the\r\nquestion. We feel it to be altogether preposterous to assume that at a\r\ncertain stage of complexity of atomic constitution, and as a necessary\r\nresult of that complexity alone, an _ego_ should start into existence, a\r\nthing that _feels_, that is _conscious_ of its own existence. Here we\r\nhave the certainty that something new has arisen, a being whose nascent\r\nconsciousness has gone on increasing in power and definiteness till it\r\nhas culminated in the higher animals. No verbal explanation or attempt\r\nat explanation--such as the statement that life is the result of the\r\nmolecular forces of the protoplasm, or that the whole existing organic\r\nuniverse from the amaeba up to man was latent in the fire-mist from\r\nwhich the solar system was developed--can afford any mental\r\nsatisfaction, or help us in any way to a solution of the mystery.\r\n\r\nThe third stage is, as we have seen, the existence in man of a number of\r\nhis most characteristic and noblest faculties, those which raise him\r\nfurthest above the brutes and open up possibilities of almost indefinite\r\nadvancement. These faculties could not possibly have been developed by\r\nmeans of the same laws which have determined the progressive development\r\nof the organic world in general, and also of man's physical\r\norganism.[237]\r\n\r\nThese three distinct stages of progress from the inorganic world of\r\nmatter and motion up to man, point clearly to an unseen universe--to a\r\nworld of spirit, to which the world of matter is altogether subordinate.\r\nTo this spiritual world we may refer the marvellously complex forces\r\nwhich we know as gravitation, cohesion, chemical force, radiant force,\r\nand electricity, without which the material universe could not exist for\r\na moment in its present form, and perhaps not at all, since without\r\nthese forces, and perhaps others which may be termed atomic, it is\r\ndoubtful whether matter itself could have any existence. And still more\r\nsurely can we refer to it those progressive manifestations of Life in\r\nthe vegetable, the animal, and man--which we may classify as\r\nunconscious, conscious, and intellectual life,--and which probably\r\ndepend upon different degrees of spiritual influx. I have already shown\r\nthat this involves no necessary infraction of the law of continuity in\r\nphysical or mental evolution; whence it follows that any difficulty we\r\nmay find in discriminating the inorganic from the organic, the lower\r\nvegetable from the lower animal organisms, or the higher animals from\r\nthe lowest types of man, has no bearing at all upon the question. This\r\nis to be decided by showing that a change in essential nature (due,\r\nprobably, to causes of a higher order than those of the material\r\nuniverse) took place at the several stages of progress which I have\r\nindicated; a change which may be none the less real because absolutely\r\nimperceptible at its point of origin, as is the change that takes place\r\nin the curve in which a body is moving when the application of some new\r\nforce causes the curve to be slightly altered.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Concluding Remarks._\r\n\r\nThose who admit my interpretation of the evidence now adduced--strictly\r\nscientific evidence in its appeal to facts which are clearly what ought\r\n_not_ to be on the materialistic theory--will be able to accept the\r\nspiritual nature of man, as not in any way inconsistent with the theory\r\nof evolution, but as dependent on those fundamental laws and causes\r\nwhich furnish the very materials for evolution to work with. They will\r\nalso be relieved from the crushing mental burthen imposed upon those\r\nwho--maintaining that we, in common with the rest of nature, are but\r\nproducts of the blind eternal forces of the universe, and believing also\r\nthat the time must come when the sun will lose his heat and all life on\r\nthe earth necessarily cease--have to contemplate a not very distant\r\nfuture in which all this glorious earth--which for untold millions of\r\nyears has been slowly developing forms of life and beauty to culminate\r\nat last in man--shall be as if it had never existed; who are compelled\r\nto suppose that all the slow growths of our race struggling towards a\r\nhigher life, all the agony of martyrs, all the groans of victims, all\r\nthe evil and misery and undeserved suffering of the ages, all the\r\nstruggles for freedom, all the efforts towards justice, all the\r\naspirations for virtue and the wellbeing of humanity, shall absolutely\r\nvanish, and, \"like the baseless fabric of a vision, leave not a wrack\r\nbehind.\"\r\n\r\nAs contrasted with this hopeless and soul-deadening belief, we, who\r\naccept the existence of a spiritual world, can look upon the universe as\r\na grand consistent whole adapted in all its parts to the development of\r\nspiritual beings capable of indefinite life and perfectibility. To us,\r\nthe whole purpose, the only _raison d'être_ of the world--with all its\r\ncomplexities of physical structure, with its grand geological progress,\r\nthe slow evolution of the vegetable and animal kingdoms, and the\r\nultimate appearance of man--was the development of the human spirit in\r\nassociation with the human body. From the fact that the spirit of\r\nman--the man himself--_is_ so developed, we may well believe that this\r\nis the only, or at least the best, way for its development; and we may\r\neven see in what is usually termed \"evil\" on the earth, one of the most\r\nefficient means of its growth. For we know that the noblest faculties of\r\nman are strengthened and perfected by struggle and effort; it is by\r\nunceasing warfare against physical evils and in the midst of difficulty\r\nand danger that energy, courage, self-reliance, and industry have become\r\nthe common qualities of the northern races; it is by the battle with\r\nmoral evil in all its hydra-headed forms, that the still nobler\r\nqualities of justice and mercy and humanity and self-sacrifice have been\r\nsteadily increasing in the world. Beings thus trained and strengthened\r\nby their surroundings, and possessing latent faculties capable of such\r\nnoble development, are surely destined for a higher and more permanent\r\nexistence; and we may confidently believe with our greatest living\r\npoet--\r\n\r\n\r\n    That life is not as idle ore,\r\n\r\n    But iron dug from central gloom,\r\n        And heated hot with burning fears,\r\n        And dipt in baths of hissing tears,\r\n    And batter'd with the shocks of doom\r\n\r\n    To shape and use.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe thus find that the Darwinian theory, even when carried out to its\r\nextreme logical conclusion, not only does not oppose, but lends a\r\ndecided support to, a belief in the spiritual nature of man. It shows us\r\nhow man's body may have been developed from that of a lower animal form\r\nunder the law of natural selection; but it also teaches us that we\r\npossess intellectual and moral faculties which could not have been so\r\ndeveloped, but must have had another origin; and for this origin we can\r\nonly find an adequate cause in the unseen universe of Spirit.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 218: _Descent of Man_, pp. 41-43; also pp. 13-15.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 219: _Man's Place in Nature_, p. 64.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 220: _Man's Place in Nature_, p. 67.

If they are now, with a little\r\npractice, able to count much higher, this indicates the possession of a\r\nfaculty which could not have been developed under the law of utility\r\nonly, since the absence of words for such high numbers shows that they\r\nwere neither used nor required.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 232: Article Arithmetic in _Eng.

Many more,\r\nof course, can be drilled into a fair knowledge of elementary\r\nmathematics, but only this small proportion possess the natural faculty\r\nwhich renders it possible for them ever to rank high as mathematicians,\r\nto take any pleasure in it, or to do any original mathematical work.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 235: I am informed, however, by a music master in a large\r\nschool that only about one per cent have real or decided musical talent,\r\ncorresponding curiously with the estimate of the mathematicians.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 236: In the latter part of his essay on Heredity (pp. 91-93 of\r\nthe volume of _Essays_), Dr. Weismann refers to this question of the\r\norigin of \"talents\" in man, and, like myself, comes to the conclusion\r\nthat they could not be developed under the law of natural selection. He\r\nsays: \"It may be objected that, in man, in addition to the instincts\r\ninherent in every individual, special individual predispositions are\r\nalso found, of such a nature that it is impossible they can have arisen\r\nby individual variations of the germ-plasm. On the other hand, these\r\npredispositions--which we call talents--cannot have arisen through\r\nnatural selection, because life is in no way dependent on their\r\npresence, and there seems to be no way of explaining their origin except\r\nby an assumption of the summation of the skill attained by exercise in\r\nthe course of each single life. In this case, therefore, we seem at\r\nfirst sight to be compelled to accept the transmission of acquired\r\ncharacters.\" Weismann then goes on to show that the facts do not support\r\nthis view; that the mathematical, musical, or artistic faculties often\r\nappear suddenly in a family whose other members and ancestors were in no\r\nway distinguished; and that even when hereditary in families, the talent\r\noften appears at its maximum at the commencement or in the middle of the\r\nseries, not increasing to the end, as it should do if it depended in any\r\nway on the transmission of acquired skill. Gauss was not the son of a\r\nmathematician, nor Handel of a musician, nor Titian of a painter, and\r\nthere is no proof of any special talent in the ancestors of these men of\r\ngenius, who at once developed the most marvellous pre-eminence in their\r\nrespective talents. And after showing that such great men only appear at\r\ncertain stages of human development, and that two or more of the special\r\ntalents are not unfrequently combined in one individual, he concludes\r\nthus--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Upon this subject I only wish to add that, in my opinion,\r\n    talents do not appear to depend upon the improvement of any\r\n    special mental quality by continued practice, but they are the\r\n    expression, and to a certain extent the bye-product, of the\r\n    human mind, which is so highly developed in all directions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will, I think, be admitted that this view hardly accounts for the\r\nexistence of the highly peculiar human faculties in question.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 237: For an earlier discussion of this subject, with
