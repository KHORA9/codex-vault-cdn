I'd always dreamed of having a book\r\njust materialize, fully formed, and come pouring out of my fingertips,\r\nno sweat and fuss -- but it wasn't nearly as much fun as I'd thought it\r\nwould be. There were days when I wrote 10,000 words, hunching over my\r\nkeyboard in airports, on subways, in taxis -- anywhere I could type.\r\nThe book was trying to get out of my head, no matter what, and I missed\r\nso much sleep and so many meals that friends started to ask if I was\r\nunwell.\r\n\r\nWhen my dad was a young university student in the 1960s, he was one of\r\nthe few \"counterculture\" people who thought computers were a good\r\nthing. For most young people, computers represented the de-humanization\r\nof society. University students were reduced to numbers on a punchcard,\r\neach bearing the legend \"DO NOT BEND, SPINDLE, FOLD OR MUTILATE,\"\r\nprompting some of the students to wear pins that said, \"I AM A STUDENT:\r\nDO NOT BEND, SPINDLE, FOLD OR MUTILATE ME.\" Computers were seen as a\r\nmeans to increase the ability of the authorities to regiment people and\r\nbend them to their will.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a 17, the world seemed like it was just going to get more\r\nfree. The Berlin Wall was about to come down. Computers -- which had\r\nbeen geeky and weird a few years before -- were everywhere, and the\r\nmodem I'd used to connect to local bulletin board systems was now\r\nconnecting me to the entire world through the Internet and commercial\r\nonline services like GEnie. My lifelong fascination with activist\r\ncauses went into overdrive as I saw how the main difficulty in activism\r\n-- organizing -- was getting easier by leaps and bounds (I still\r\nremember the first time I switched from mailing out a newsletter with\r\nhand-written addresses to using a database with mail-merge). In the\r\nSoviet Union, communications tools were being used to bring information\r\n-- and revolution -- to the farthest-flung corners of the largest\r\nauthoritarian state the Earth had ever seen.\r\n\r\nBut 17 years later, things are very different. The computers I love are\r\nbeing co-opted, used to spy on us, control us, snitch on us. The\r\nNational Security Agency has illegally wiretapped the entire USA and\r\ngotten away with it. Car rental companies and mass transit and traffic\r\nauthorities are watching where we go, sending us automated tickets,\r\nfinking us out to busybodies, cops and bad guys who gain illicit access\r\nto their databases. The Transport Security Administration maintains a\r\n\"no-fly\" list of people who'd never been convicted of any crime, but\r\nwho are nevertheless considered too dangerous to fly. The list's\r\ncontents are secret. The rule that makes it enforceable is secret. The\r\ncriteria for being added to the list are secret. It has four-year-olds\r\non it. And US senators. And decorated veterans -- actual war heroes.\r\n\r\nThe 17 year olds I know understand to a nicety just how dangerous a\r\ncomputer can be. The authoritarian nightmare of the 1960s has come home\r\nfor them. The seductive little boxes on their desks and in their\r\npockets watch their every move, corral them in, systematically\r\ndepriving them of those new freedoms I had enjoyed and made such good\r\nuse of in my young adulthood.\r\n\r\nWhat's more, kids were clearly being used as guinea-pigs for a new kind\r\nof technological state that all of us were on our way to, a world where\r\ntaking a picture was either piracy (in a movie theater or museum or\r\neven a Starbucks), or terrorism (in a public place), but where we could\r\nbe photographed, tracked and logged hundreds of times a day by every\r\ntin-pot dictator, cop, bureaucrat and shop-keeper. A world where any\r\nmeasure, including torture, could be justified just by waving your\r\nhands and shouting \"Terrorism! 9/11! Terrorism!\" until all dissent fell\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nWe don't have to go down that road.\r\n\r\nIf you love freedom, if you think the human condition is dignified by\r\nprivacy, by the right to be left alone, by the right to explore your\r\nweird ideas provided you don't hurt others, then you have common cause\r\nwith the kids whose web-browsers and cell phones are being used to lock\r\nthem up and follow them around.\r\n\r\nIf you believe that the answer to bad speech is more speech -- not\r\ncensorship -- then you have a dog in the fight.\r\n\r\nIf you believe in a society of laws, a land where our rulers have to\r\ntell us the rules, and have to follow them too, then you're part of the\r\nsame struggle that kids fight when they argue for the right to live\r\nunder the same Bill of Rights that adults have.\r\n\r\nThis book is meant to be part of the conversation about what an\r\ninformation society means: does it mean total control, or unheard-of\r\nliberty? It's not just a noun, it's a verb, it's something you do.\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nDO SOMETHING\r\n\r\nThis book is meant to be something you do, not just something you read.\r\nThe technology in this book is either real or nearly real. You can\r\nbuild a lot of it. You can share it and remix it (see THE COPYRIGHT\r\nTHING, below). You can use the ideas to spark important discussions\r\nwith your friends and family. You can use those ideas to defeat\r\ncensorship and get onto the free Internet, even if your government,\r\nemployer or school doesn't want you to.\r\n\r\nMaking stuff: The folks at Instructables have put up some killer HOWTOs\r\nfor building the technology in this book. It's easy and incredibly fun.\r\nThere's nothing so rewarding in this world as making stuff, especially\r\nstuff that makes you more free:\r\nhttp://www.instructables.com/member/w1n5t0n/\r\n\r\nDiscussions: There's an educator's manual for this book that my\r\npublisher, Tor, has put together that has tons of ideas for classroom,\r\nreading group and home discussions of the ideas in it:\r\nhttp://www.tor-forge.com/static/Little_Brother_Readers_Guide.pdf\r\n\r\nDefeat censorship: The afterword for this book has lots of resources\r\nfor increasing your online freedom, blocking the snoops and evading the\r\ncensorware blocks. The more people who know about this stuff, the\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nYour stories: I'm collecting stories of people who've used technology\r\nto get the upper hand when confronted with abusive authority. I'm going\r\nto be including the best of these in a special afterword to the UK\r\nedition (see below) of the book, and I'll be putting them online as\r\nwell. Send me your stories at doctorow@craphound.com, with the subject\r\nline \"Abuses of Authority\".\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nGREAT BRITAIN\r\n\r\nI'm a Canadian, and I've lived in lots of places (including San\r\nFrancisco, the setting for Little Brother), and now I live in London,\r\nEngland, with my wife Alice and our little daughter, Poesy. I've lived\r\nhere (off and on) for five years now, and though I love it to tiny\r\npieces, there's one thing that's always bugged me: my books aren't\r\navailable here. Some stores carried them as special items, imported\r\nfrom the USA, but it wasn't published by a British publisher.\r\n\r\nThat's changed! HarperCollins UK has bought the British rights to this\r\nbook (along with my next young adult novel, FOR THE WIN), and they're\r\npublishing it just a few months after the US edition, on November 17,\r\n2008 (the day after I get back from my honeymoon!).\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE: November 27, 2008: And it's on shelves now! The HarperCollins\r\nedition's a knockout, too!\r\n\r\nI'm so glad about this, I could bust, honestly. Not just because\r\nthey're finally selling my books in my adopted homeland, but because\r\n*I'm raising a daughter here, dammit*, and the surveillance and control\r\nmania in this country is starting to scare me bloodless. It seems like\r\nthe entire police and governance system in Britain has fallen in love\r\nwith DNA-swabbing, fingerprinting and video-recording everyone, on the\r\noff chance that someday you might do something wrong. In early 2008,\r\nthe head of Scotland Yard seriously proposed taking DNA from\r\n*five-year-olds* who display \"offending traits\" because they'll\r\nprobably grow up to be criminals. The next week, the London police put\r\nup posters asking us all to turn in people who seem to be taking\r\npictures of the ubiquitous CCTV spy-cameras because anyone who pays too\r\nmuch attention to the surveillance machine is probably a terrorist.\r\n\r\nAmerica isn't the only country that lost its mind this decade.\r\nBritain's right there in the nuthouse with it, dribbling down its shirt\r\nfront and pointing its finger at the invisible bogeymen and screaming\r\nuntil it gets its meds.\r\n\r\nWe need to be having this conversation all over the planet.\r\n\r\nWant to get a copy in the UK? Sure thing!\r\nhttp://craphound.com/littlebrother/buy/#uk\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nOTHER EDITIONS\r\n\r\nMy agent, Russell Galen (and his sub-agent Danny Baror) did an amazing\r\njob of pre-selling rights to Little Brother in many languages and\r\nformats. Here's the list as of today (May 4, 2008). I'll be updating it\r\nas more editions are sold, so feel free to grab another copy of this\r\nfile (http://craphound.com/littlebrother/download)  if there's an\r\nedition you're hoping to see, or see\r\nhttp://craphound.com/littlebrother/buy/ for links to buy all the\r\ncurrently shipping editions.\r\n\r\n* Audiobook from Random House:\r\nhttp://www.randomhouse.com/audio/littlebrotheraudiobook\r\n\r\nA condition of my deal with Random House is that they're not allowed to\r\nrelease this on services that use \"DRM\" (Digital Rights Management)\r\nsystems intended to control use and copying. That means that you won't\r\nfind this book on Audible or iTunes, because Audible refuses to sell\r\nbooks without DRM (even if the author and publisher don't want DRM),\r\nand iTunes only carries Audible audiobooks. However, you can buy the\r\nMP3 file direct from RandomHouse or many other fine etailers, or\r\nthrough this widget:\r\nhttp://www.zipidee.com/zipidAudioPreview.aspx?aid=c5a8e946-fd2c-4b9e-\r\na748-f297bba17de8\r\n\r\n* My foreign rights agent, Danny Baror, has presold a number of foreign\r\neditions:\r\n\r\n\t* Greece: Pataki\r\n\r\n\t* Russia: AST Publishing\r\n\r\n\t* France: Universe Poche\r\n\r\n\t* Norway: Det Norske Samlaget\r\n\r\nNo publication dates yet for these, but I'll keep updating this file as\r\nmore information is available. You can also subscribe to my mailing\r\nlist for more info.\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nTHE COPYRIGHT THING\r\n\r\nThe Creative Commons license at the top of this file probably tipped\r\nyou off to the fact that I've got some pretty unorthodox views about\r\ncopyright. Here's what I think of it, in a nutshell: a little goes a\r\nlong way, and more than that is too much.\r\n\r\nI like the fact that copyright lets me sell rights to my publishers and\r\nfilm studios and so on. It's nice that they can't just take my stuff\r\nwithout permission and get rich on it without cutting me in for a piece\r\nof the action. I'm in a pretty good position when it comes to\r\nnegotiating with these companies: I've got a great agent and a decade's\r\nexperience with copyright law and licensing (including a stint as a\r\ndelegate at WIPO, the UN agency that makes the world's copyright\r\ntreaties). What's more, there's just not that many of these\r\nnegotiations -- even if I sell fifty or a hundred different editions of\r\nLittle Brother (which would put it in top millionth of a percentile for\r\nfiction), that's still only a hundred negotiations, which I could just\r\nabout manage.\r\n\r\nI *hate* the fact that fans who want to do what readers have always\r\ndone are expected to play in the same system as all these hotshot\r\nagents and lawyers. It's just *stupid* to say that an elementary school\r\nclassroom should have to talk to a lawyer at a giant global publisher\r\nbefore they put on a play based on one of my books. It's ridiculous to\r\nsay that people who want to \"loan\" their electronic copy of my book to\r\na friend need to get a *license* to do so. Loaning books has been\r\naround longer than any publisher on Earth, and it's a fine thing.\r\n\r\nI recently saw Neil Gaiman give a talk at which someone asked him how\r\nhe felt about piracy of his books. He said, \"Hands up in the audience\r\nif you discovered your favorite writer for free -- because someone\r\nloaned you a copy, or because someone gave it to you? Now, hands up if\r\nyou found your favorite writer by walking into a store and plunking\r\ndown cash.\" Overwhelmingly, the audience said that they'd discovered\r\ntheir favorite writers for free, on a loan or as a gift. When it comes\r\nto my favorite writers, there's no boundaries: I'll buy every book they\r\npublish, just to own it (sometimes I buy two or three, to give away to\r\nfriends who *must* read those books). I pay to see them live. I buy\r\nt-shirts with their book-covers on them. I'm a customer for life.\r\n\r\nNeil went on to say that he was part of the tribe of readers, the tiny\r\nminority of people in the world who read for pleasure, buying books\r\nbecause they love them. One thing he knows about everyone who downloads\r\nhis books on the Internet without permission is that they're *readers*,\r\nthey're people who love books.\r\n\r\nPeople who study the habits of music-buyers have discovered something\r\ncurious: the biggest pirates are also the biggest spenders. If you\r\npirate music all night long, chances are you're one of the few people\r\nleft who also goes to the record store (remember those?) during the\r\nday. You probably go to concerts on the weekend, and you probably check\r\nmusic out of the library too. If you're a member of the red-hot\r\nmusic-fan tribe, you do lots of *everything* that has to do with music,\r\nfrom singing in the shower to paying for black-market vinyl bootlegs of\r\nrare Eastern European covers of your favorite death-metal band.\r\n\r\nSame with books. I've worked in new bookstores, used bookstores and\r\nlibraries. I've hung out in pirate ebook (\"bookwarez\") places online.\r\nI'm a stone used bookstore junkie, and I go to book fairs for fun. And\r\nyou know what? It's the same people at all those places: book fans who\r\ndo lots of everything that has to do with books. I buy weird, fugly\r\npirate editions of my favorite books in China because they're weird and\r\nfugly and look great next to the eight or nine other editions that I\r\npaid full-freight for of the same books. I check books out of the\r\nlibrary, google them when I need a quote, carry dozens around on my\r\nphone and hundreds on my laptop, and have (at this writing) more than\r\n10,000 of them in storage lockers in London, Los Angeles and Toronto.\r\n\r\nIf I could loan out my physical books without giving up possession of\r\nthem, I *would*. The fact that I can do so with digital files is not a\r\nbug, it's a feature, and a damned fine one. It's embarrassing to see\r\nall these writers and musicians and artists bemoaning the fact that art\r\njust got this wicked new feature: the ability to be shared without\r\nlosing access to it in the first place. It's like watching restaurant\r\nowners crying down their shirts about the new free lunch machine that's\r\nfeeding the world's starving people because it'll force them to\r\nreconsider their business-models. Yes, that's gonna be tricky, but\r\nlet's not lose sight of the main attraction: free lunches!\r\n\r\nUniversal access to human knowledge is in our grasp, for the first time\r\nin the history of the world. This is not a bad thing.\r\n\r\nIn case that's not enough for you, here's my pitch on why giving away\r\nebooks makes sense at this time and place:\r\n\r\nGiving away ebooks gives me artistic, moral and commercial\r\nsatisfaction. The commercial question is the one that comes up most\r\noften: how can you give away free ebooks and still make money?\r\n\r\nFor me -- for pretty much every writer -- the big problem isn't piracy,\r\nit's obscurity (thanks to Tim O'Reilly for this great aphorism). Of all\r\nthe people who failed to buy this book today, the majority did so\r\nbecause they never heard of it, not because someone gave them a free\r\ncopy. Mega-hit best-sellers in science fiction sell half a million\r\ncopies -- in a world where 175,000 attend the San Diego Comic Con\r\nalone, you've got to figure that most of the people who \"like science\r\nfiction\" (and related geeky stuff like comics, games, Linux, and so on)\r\njust don't really buy books. I'm more interested in getting more of\r\nthat wider audience into the tent than making sure that everyone who's\r\nin the tent bought a ticket to be there.\r\n\r\nEbooks are verbs, not nouns. You copy them, it's in their nature. And\r\nmany of those copies have a destination, a person they're intended for,\r\na hand-wrought transfer from one person to another, embodying a\r\npersonal recommendation between two people who trust each other enough\r\nto share bits. That's the kind of thing that authors (should) dream of,\r\nthe proverbial sealing of the deal. By making my books available for\r\nfree pass-along, I make it easy for people who love them to help other\r\npeople love them.\r\n\r\nWhat's more, I don't see ebooks as substitute for paper books for most\r\npeople. It's not that the screens aren't good enough, either: if you're\r\nanything like me, you already spend every hour you can get in front of\r\nthe screen, reading text. But the more computer-literate you are, the\r\nless likely you are to be reading long-form works on those screens --\r\nthat's because computer-literate people do more things with their\r\ncomputers. We run IM and email and we use the browser in a million\r\ndiverse ways. We have games running in the background, and endless\r\nopportunities to tinker with our music libraries. The more you do with\r\nyour computer, the more likely it is that you'll be interrupted after\r\nfive to seven minutes to do something else. That makes the computer\r\nextremely poorly suited to reading long-form works off of, unless you\r\nhave the iron self-discipline of a monk.\r\n\r\nThe good news (for writers) is that this means that ebooks on computers\r\nare more likely to be an enticement to buy the printed book (which is,\r\nafter all, cheap, easily had, and easy to use) than a substitute for\r\nit. You can probably read just enough of the book off the screen to\r\nrealize you want to be reading it on paper.\r\n\r\nSo ebooks sell print books. Every writer I've heard of who's tried\r\ngiving away ebooks to promote paper books has come back to do it again.\r\nThat's the commercial case for doing free ebooks.\r\n\r\nNow, onto the artistic case. It's the twenty-first century. Copying\r\nstuff is never, ever going to get any harder than it is today (or if it\r\ndoes, it'll be because civilization has collapsed, at which point we'll\r\nhave other problems). Hard drives aren't going to get bulkier, more\r\nexpensive, or less capacious. Networks won't get slower or harder to\r\naccess. If you're not making art with the intention of having it\r\ncopied, you're not really making art for the twenty-first century.\r\nThere's something charming about making work you don't want to be\r\ncopied, in the same way that it's nice to go to a Pioneer Village and\r\nsee the olde-timey blacksmith shoeing a horse at his traditional forge.\r\nBut it's hardly, you know, *contemporary*. I'm a science fiction\r\nwriter. It's my job to write about the future (on a good day) or at\r\nleast the present. Art that's not supposed to be copied is from the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nFinally, let's look at the moral case. Copying stuff is natural. It's\r\nhow we learn (copying our parents and the people around us). My first\r\nstory, written when I was six, was an excited re-telling of Star Wars,\r\nwhich I'd just seen in the theater. Now that the Internet -- the\r\nworld's most efficient copying machine -- is pretty much everywhere,\r\nour copying instinct is just going to play out more and more. There's\r\nno way I can stop my readers, and if I tried, I'd be a hypocrite: when\r\nI was 17, I was making mix-tapes, photocopying stories, and generally\r\ncopying in every way I could imagine. If the Internet had been around\r\nthen, I'd have been using it to copy as much as I possibly could.\r\n\r\nThere's no way to stop it, and the people who try end up doing more\r\nharm than piracy ever did. The record industry's ridiculous holy war\r\nagainst file-sharers (more than 20,000 music fans sued and counting!)\r\nexemplifies the absurdity of trying to get the food-coloring out of the\r\nswimming pool. If the choice is between allowing copying or being a\r\nfrothing bully lashing out at anything he can reach, I choose the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nDONATIONS AND A WORD TO TEACHERS AND LIBRARIANS\r\n\r\nEvery time I put a book online for free, I get emails from readers who\r\nwant to send me donations for the book. I appreciate their generous\r\nspirit, but I'm not interested in cash donations, because my publishers\r\nare really important to me. They contribute immeasurably to the book,\r\nimproving it, introducing it to audience I could never reach, helping\r\nme do more with my work. I have no desire to cut them out of the loop.\r\n\r\nBut there has to be some good way to turn that generosity to good use,\r\nand I think I've found it.\r\n\r\nHere's the deal: there are lots of teachers and librarians who'd love\r\nto get hard-copies of this book into their kids' hands, but don't have\r\nthe budget for it (teachers in the US spend around $1,200 out of pocket\r\neach on classroom supplies that their budgets won't stretch to cover,\r\nwhich is why I sponsor a classroom at Ivanhoe Elementary in my old\r\nneighborhood in Los Angeles; you can adopt a class yourself here:\r\nhttp://www.adoptaclassroom.org/).\r\n\r\nThere are generous people who want to send some cash my way to thank me\r\nfor the free ebooks.\r\n\r\nI'm proposing that we put them together.\r\n\r\nIf you're a teacher or librarian and you want a free copy of Little\r\nBrother, email freelittlebrother@gmail.com with your name and the name\r\nand address of your school. It'll be posted to\r\nhttp://craphound.com/littlebrother/category/donate/ by my fantastic\r\nhelper, Olga Nunes, so that potential donors can see it.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoyed the electronic edition of Little Brother and you want to\r\ndonate something to say thanks, go to\r\nhttp://craphound.com/littlebrother/donate/ and find a teacher or\r\nlibrarian you want to support. Then go to Amazon, BN.com, or your\r\nfavorite electronic bookseller and order a copy to the classroom, then\r\nemail a copy of the receipt (feel free to delete your address and other\r\npersonal info first!) to freelittlebrother@gmail.com so that Olga can\r\nmark that copy as sent. If you don't want to be publicly acknowledged\r\nfor your generosity, let us know and we'll keep you anonymous,\r\notherwise we'll thank you on the donate page.\r\n\r\nI have no idea if this will end up with hundreds, dozens or just a few\r\ncopies going out -- but I have high hopes!\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nDEDICATION\r\n\r\nFor Alice, who makes me whole\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nQUOTES\r\n\r\n\"A rousing tale of techno-geek rebellion, as necessary and dangerous as\r\nfile sharing, free speech, and bottled water on a plane.\"\r\n\r\nScott Westerfeld, author of UGLIES and EXTRAS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I can talk about Little Brother in terms of its bravura political\r\nspeculation or its brilliant uses of technology -- each of which make\r\nthis book a must-read -- but, at the end of it all, I'm haunted by the\r\nuniversality of Marcus's rite-of-passage and struggle, an experience\r\nany teen today is going to grasp: the moment when you choose what your\r\nlife will mean and how to achieve it.\"\r\n\r\nSteven C Gould, author of JUMPER and REFLEX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd recommend Little Brother over pretty much any book I've read this\r\nyear, and I'd want to get it into the hands of as many smart 13 year\r\nolds, male and female, as I can.\r\n\r\nBecause I think it'll change lives. Because some kids, maybe just a\r\nfew, won't be the same after they've read it. Maybe they'll change\r\npolitically, maybe technologically. Maybe it'll just be the first book\r\nthey loved or that spoke to their inner geek. Maybe they'll want to\r\nargue about it and disagree with it. Maybe they'll want to open their\r\ncomputer and see what's in there. I don't know. It made me want to be\r\n13 again right now and reading it for the first time, and then go out\r\nand make the world better or stranger or odder.

I wandered in for the first time around the\r\nage of 10 and asked for some recommendations. Tanya Huff (yes, *the*\r\nTanya Huff, but she wasn't a famous writer back then!) took me back\r\ninto the used section and pressed a copy of H. Beam Piper's \"Little\r\nFuzzy\" into my hands, and changed my life forever. By the time I was\r\n18, I was working at Bakka -- I took over from Tanya when she retired\r\nto write full time -- and I learned life-long lessons about how and why\r\npeople buy books. I think every writer should work at a bookstore (and\r\nplenty of writers have worked at Bakka over the years!

My name is Marcus Yallow, but back when this story starts, I was\r\ngoing by w1n5t0n. Pronounced \"Winston.\"\r\n\r\n*Not* pronounced \"Double-you-one-enn-five-tee-zero-enn\" -- unless\r\nyou're a clueless disciplinary officer who's far enough behind the\r\ncurve that you still call the Internet \"the information superhighway.\"\r\n\r\nI know just such a clueless person, and his name is Fred Benson, one of\r\nthree vice-principals at Cesar Chavez. He's a sucking chest wound of a\r\nhuman being. But if you're going to have a jailer, better a clueless\r\none than one who's really on the ball.\r\n\r\n\"Marcus Yallow,\" he said over the PA one Friday morning. The PA isn't\r\nvery good to begin with, and when you combine that with Benson's\r\nhabitual mumble, you get something that sounds more like someone\r\nstruggling to digest a bad burrito than a school announcement. But\r\nhuman beings are good at picking their names out of audio confusion --\r\nit's a survival trait.\r\n\r\nI grabbed my bag and folded my laptop three-quarters shut -- I didn't\r\nwant to blow my downloads -- and got ready for the inevitable.\r\n\r\n\"Report to the administration office immediately.\"\r\n\r\nMy social studies teacher, Ms Galvez, rolled her eyes at me and I\r\nrolled my eyes back at her. The Man was always coming down on me, just\r\nbecause I go through school firewalls like wet kleenex, spoof the\r\ngait-recognition software, and nuke the snitch chips they track us\r\nwith. Galvez is a good type, anyway, never holds that against me\r\n(especially when I'm helping get with her webmail so she can talk to\r\nher brother who's stationed in Iraq).\r\n\r\nMy boy Darryl gave me a smack on the ass as I walked past. I've known\r\nDarryl since we were still in diapers and escaping from play-school,\r\nand I've been getting him into and out of trouble the whole time. I\r\nraised my arms over my head like a prizefighter and made my exit from\r\nSocial Studies and began the perp-walk to the office.\r\n\r\nI was halfway there when my phone went. That was another no-no --\r\nphones are muy prohibido at Chavez High -- but why should that stop me?\r\nI ducked into the toilet and shut myself in the middle stall (the\r\nfurthest stall is always grossest because so many people head straight\r\nfor it, hoping to escape the smell and the squick -- the smart money\r\nand good hygiene is down the middle). I checked the phone -- my home PC\r\nhad sent it an email to tell it that there was something new up on\r\nHarajuku Fun Madness, which happens to be the best game ever invented.\r\n\r\nI grinned. Spending Fridays at school was teh suck anyway, and I was\r\nglad of the excuse to make my escape.\r\n\r\nI ambled the rest of the way to Benson's office and tossed him a wave\r\nas I sailed through the door.\r\n\r\n\"If it isn't Double-you-one-enn-five-tee-zero-enn,\" he said. Fredrick\r\nBenson -- Social Security number 545-03-2343, date of birth August 15\r\n1962, mother's maiden name Di Bona, hometown Petaluma -- is a lot\r\ntaller than me. I'm a runty 5'8\", while he stands 6'7\", and his college\r\nbasketball days are far enough behind him that his chest muscles have\r\nturned into saggy man-boobs that were painfully obvious through his\r\nfreebie dot-com polo-shirts. He always looks like he's about to\r\nslam-dunk your ass, and he's really into raising his voice for dramatic\r\neffect. Both these start to lose their efficacy with repeated\r\napplication.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, nope,\" I said. \"I never heard of this R2D2 character of yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"W1n5t0n,\" he said, spelling it out again. He gave me a hairy eyeball\r\nand waited for me to wilt. Of course it was my handle, and had been for\r\nyears. It was the identity I used when I was posting on message-boards\r\nwhere I was making my contributions to the field of applied security\r\nresearch. You know, like sneaking out of school and disabling the\r\nminder-tracer on my phone. But he didn't know that this was my handle.\r\nOnly a small number of people did, and I trusted them all to the end of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n\"Um, not ringing any bells,\" I said. I'd done some pretty cool stuff\r\naround school using that handle -- I was very proud of my work on\r\nsnitch-tag killers -- and if he could link the two identities, I'd be\r\nin trouble. No one at school ever called me w1n5t0n or even Winston.\r\nNot even my pals. It was Marcus or nothing.\r\n\r\nBenson settled down behind his desk and tapped his class-ring nervously\r\non his blotter. He did this whenever things started to go bad for him.\r\nPoker players call stuff like this a \"tell\" -- something that let you\r\nknow what was going on in the other guy's head. I knew Benson's tells\r\nbackwards and forwards.\r\n\r\n\"Marcus, I hope you realize how serious this is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will just as soon as you explain what this is, sir.\" I always say\r\n\"sir\" to authority figures when I'm messing with them. It's my own\r\ntell.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head at me and looked down, another tell. Any second now,\r\nhe was going to start shouting at me. \"Listen, kiddo! It's time you\r\ncame to grips with the fact that we know about what you've been doing,\r\nand that we're not going to be lenient about it. You're going to be\r\nlucky if you're not expelled before this meeting is through. Do you\r\nwant to graduate?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr Benson, you still haven't explained what the problem is --\"\r\n\r\nHe slammed his hand down on the desk and then pointed his finger at me.\r\n\"The *problem*, Mr Yallow, is that you've been engaged in criminal\r\nconspiracy to subvert this school's security system, and you have\r\nsupplied security countermeasures to your fellow students. You know\r\nthat we expelled Graciella Uriarte last week for using one of your\r\ndevices.\" Uriarte had gotten a bad rap. She'd bought a radio-jammer\r\nfrom a head-shop near the 16th Street BART station and it had set off\r\nthe countermeasures in the school hallway. Not my doing, but I felt for\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"And you think I'm involved in that?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have reliable intelligence indicating that you are w1n5t0n\" --\r\nagain, he spelled it out, and I began to wonder if he hadn't figured\r\nout that the 1 was an I and the 5 was an S. \"We know that this w1n5t0n\r\ncharacter is responsible for the theft of last year's standardized\r\ntests.\" That actually hadn't been me, but it was a sweet hack, and it\r\nwas kind of flattering to hear it attributed to me. \"And therefore\r\nliable for several years in prison unless you cooperate with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have 'reliable intelligence'? I'd like to see it.\"\r\n\r\nHe glowered at me. \"Your attitude isn't going to help you.\"\r\n\r\n\"If there's evidence, sir, I think you should call the police and turn\r\nit over to them. It sounds like this is a very serious matter, and I\r\nwouldn't want to stand in the way of a proper investigation by the duly\r\nconstituted authorities.\"\r\n\r\n\"You want me to call the police.\"\r\n\r\n\"And my parents, I think. That would be for the best.\"\r\n\r\nWe stared at each other across the desk. He'd clearly expected me to\r\nfold the second he dropped the bomb on me. I don't fold. I have a trick\r\nfor staring down people like Benson. I look slightly to the left of\r\ntheir heads, and think about the lyrics to old Irish folk songs, the\r\nkinds with three hundred verses. It makes me look perfectly composed\r\nand unworried.\r\n\r\n*And the wing was on the bird and the bird was on the egg and the egg\r\nwas in the nest and the nest was on the leaf and the leaf was on the\r\ntwig and the twig was on the branch and the branch was on the limb and\r\nthe limb was in the tree and the tree was in the bog -- the bog down in\r\nthe valley-oh! High-ho the rattlin' bog, the bog down in the valley-oh\r\n--*\r\n\r\n\"You can return to class now,\" he said. \"I'll call on you once the\r\npolice are ready to speak to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to call them now?\"\r\n\r\n\"The procedure for calling in the police is complicated. I'd hoped that\r\nwe could settle this fairly and quickly, but since you insist --\"\r\n\r\n\"I can wait while you call them is all,\" I said. \"I don't mind.\"\r\n\r\nHe tapped his ring again and I braced for the blast.\r\n\r\n\"*Go!*\" he yelled. \"Get the hell out of my office, you miserable little\r\n--\"\r\n\r\nI got out, keeping my expression neutral. He wasn't going to call the\r\ncops. If he'd had enough evidence to go to the police with, he would\r\nhave called them in the first place. He hated my guts. I figured he'd\r\nheard some unverified gossip and hoped to spook me into confirming it.\r\n\r\nI moved down the corridor lightly and sprightly, keeping my gait even\r\nand measured for the gait-recognition cameras. These had been installed\r\nonly a year before, and I loved them for their sheer idiocy.\r\nBeforehand, we'd had face-recognition cameras covering nearly every\r\npublic space in school, but a court ruled that was unconstitutional. So\r\nBenson and a lot of other paranoid school administrators had spent our\r\ntextbook dollars on these idiot cameras that were supposed to be able\r\nto tell one person's walk from another. Yeah, right.\r\n\r\nI got back to class and sat down again, Ms Galvez warmly welcoming me\r\nback. I unpacked the school's standard-issue machine and got back into\r\nclassroom mode. The SchoolBooks were the snitchiest technology of them\r\nall, logging every keystroke, watching all the network traffic for\r\nsuspicious keywords, counting every click, keeping track of every\r\nfleeting thought you put out over the net. We'd gotten them in my\r\njunior year, and it only took a couple months for the shininess to wear\r\noff. Once people figured out that these \"free\" laptops worked for the\r\nman -- and showed a never-ending parade of obnoxious ads to boot --\r\nthey suddenly started to feel very heavy and burdensome.\r\n\r\nCracking my SchoolBook had been easy. The crack was online within a\r\nmonth of the machine showing up, and there was nothing to it -- just\r\ndownload a DVD image, burn it, stick it in the SchoolBook, and boot it\r\nwhile holding down a bunch of different keys at the same time. The DVD\r\ndid the rest, installing a whole bunch of hidden programs on the\r\nmachine, programs that would stay hidden even when the Board of Ed did\r\nits daily remote integrity checks of the machines. Every now and again\r\nI had to get an update for the software to get around the Board's\r\nlatest tests, but it was a small price to pay to get a little control\r\nover the box.\r\n\r\nI fired up IMParanoid, the secret instant messenger that I used when I\r\nwanted to have an off-the-record discussion right in the middle of\r\nclass. Darryl was already logged in.\r\n\r\n> The game's afoot! Something big is going down with Harajuku Fun\r\n> Madness, dude. You in?\r\n\r\n> No. Freaking. Way. If I get caught ditching a third time, I'm\r\n> expelled. Man, you know that. We'll go after school.\r\n\r\n> You've got lunch and then study-hall, right? That's two hours. Plenty\r\n> of time to run down this clue and get back before anyone misses us.\r\n> I'll get the whole team out.\r\n\r\nHarajuku Fun Madness is the best game ever made. I know I already said\r\nthat, but it bears repeating. It's an ARG, an Alternate Reality Game,\r\nand the story goes that a gang of Japanese fashion-teens discovered a\r\nmiraculous healing gem at the temple in Harajuku, which is basically\r\nwhere cool Japanese teenagers invented every major subculture for the\r\npast ten years. They're being hunted by evil monks, the Yakuza (AKA the\r\nJapanese mafia), aliens, tax-inspectors, parents, and a rogue\r\nartificial intelligence. They slip the players coded messages that we\r\nhave to decode and use to track down clues that lead to more coded\r\nmessages and more clues.\r\n\r\nImagine the best afternoon you've ever spent prowling the streets of a\r\ncity, checking out all the weird people, funny hand-bills,\r\nstreet-maniacs, and funky shops. Now add a scavenger hunt to that, one\r\nthat requires you to research crazy old films and songs and teen\r\nculture from around the world and across time and space. And it's a\r\ncompetition, with the winning team of four taking a grand prize of ten\r\ndays in Tokyo, chilling on Harajuku bridge, geeking out in Akihabara,\r\nand taking home all the Astro Boy merchandise you can eat. Except that\r\nhe's called \"Atom Boy\" in Japan.\r\n\r\nThat's Harajuku Fun Madness, and once you've solved a puzzle or two,\r\nyou'll never look back.\r\n\r\n> No man, just no. NO. Don't even ask.\r\n\r\n> I need you D. You're the best I've got. I swear I'll get us in and\r\n> out without anyone knowing it. You know I can do that, right?\r\n\r\n> I know you can do it\r\n\r\n> So you're in?\r\n\r\n> Hell no\r\n\r\n> Come on, Darryl. You're not going to your deathbed wishing you'd\r\n> spent more study periods sitting in school\r\n\r\n> I'm not going to go to my deathbed wishing I'd spent more time\r\n> playing ARGs either\r\n\r\n> Yeah but don't you think you might go to your death-bed wishing you'd\r\n> spent more time with Vanessa Pak?\r\n\r\nVan was part of my team. She went to a private girl's school in the\r\nEast Bay, but I knew she'd ditch to come out and run the mission with\r\nme. Darryl has had a crush on her literally for years -- even before\r\npuberty endowed her with many lavish gifts. Darryl had fallen in love\r\nwith her mind. Sad, really.\r\n\r\n> You suck\r\n\r\n> You're coming?\r\n\r\nHe looked at me and shook his head. Then he nodded. I winked at him and\r\nset to work getting in touch with the rest of my team.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI wasn't always into ARGing. I have a dark secret: I used to be a\r\nLARPer. LARPing is Live Action Role Playing, and it's just about what\r\nit sounds like: running around in costume, talking in a funny accent,\r\npretending to be a super-spy or a vampire or a medieval knight. It's\r\nlike Capture the Flag in monster-drag, with a bit of Drama Club thrown\r\nin, and the best games were the ones we played in Scout Camps out of\r\ntown in Sonoma or down on the Peninsula. Those three-day epics could\r\nget pretty hairy, with all-day hikes, epic battles with foam-and-bamboo\r\nswords, casting spells by throwing beanbags and shouting \"Fireball!\"\r\nand so on. Good fun, if a little goofy. Not nearly as geeky as talking\r\nabout what your elf planned on doing as you sat around a table loaded\r\nwith Diet Coke cans and painted miniatures, and more physically active\r\nthan going into a mouse-coma in front of a massively multiplayer game\r\nat home.\r\n\r\nThe thing that got me into trouble were the mini-games in the hotels.\r\nWhenever a science fiction convention came to town, some LARPer would\r\nconvince them to let us run a couple of six-hour mini-games at the con,\r\npiggybacking on their rental of the space. Having a bunch of\r\nenthusiastic kids running around in costume lent color to the event,\r\nand we got to have a ball among people even more socially deviant than\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThe problem with hotels is that they have a lot of non-gamers in them,\r\ntoo -- and not just sci-fi people. Normal people. From states that\r\nbegin and end with vowels. On holidays.\r\n\r\nAnd sometimes those people misunderstand the nature of a game.\r\n\r\nLet's just leave it at that, OK?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClass ended in ten minutes, and that didn't leave me with much time to\r\nprepare. The first order of business were those pesky gait-recognition\r\ncameras. Like I said, they'd started out as face-recognition cameras,\r\nbut those had been ruled unconstitutional. As far as I know, no court\r\nhas yet determined whether these gait-cams are any more legal, but\r\nuntil they do, we're stuck with them.\r\n\r\n\"Gait\" is a fancy word for the way you walk. People are pretty good at\r\nspotting gaits -- next time you're on a camping trip, check out the\r\nbobbing of the flashlight as a distant friend approaches you. Chances\r\nare you can identify him just from the movement of the light, the\r\ncharacteristic way it bobs up and down that tells our monkey brains\r\nthat this is a person approaching us.\r\n\r\nGait recognition software takes pictures of your motion, tries to\r\nisolate you in the pics as a silhouette, and then tries to match the\r\nsilhouette to a database to see if it knows who you are. It's a\r\nbiometric identifier, like fingerprints or retina-scans, but it's got a\r\nlot more \"collisions\" than either of those. A biometric \"collision\" is\r\nwhen a measurement matches more than one person. Only you have your\r\nfingerprint, but you share your gait with plenty other people.\r\n\r\nNot exactly, of course. Your personal, inch-by-inch walk is yours and\r\nyours alone. The problem is your inch-by-inch walk changes based on how\r\ntired you are, what the floor is made of, whether you pulled your ankle\r\nplaying basketball, and whether you've changed your shoes lately. So\r\nthe system kind of fuzzes-out your profile, looking for people who walk\r\nkind of like you.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of people who walk kind of like you. What's more, it's\r\neasy not to walk kind of like you -- just take one shoe off. Of course,\r\nyou'll always walk like you-with-one-shoe-off in that case, so the\r\ncameras will eventually figure out that it's still you. Which is why I\r\nprefer to inject a little randomness into my attacks on\r\ngait-recognition: I put a handful of gravel into each shoe. Cheap and\r\neffective, and no two steps are the same. Plus you get a great\r\nreflexology foot massage in the process (I kid. Reflexology is about as\r\nscientifically useful as gait-recognition).\r\n\r\nThe cameras used to set off an alert every time someone they didn't\r\nrecognize stepped onto campus.\r\n\r\nThis did *not* work.\r\n\r\nThe alarm went off every ten minutes. When the mailman came by. When a\r\nparent dropped in. When the grounds-people went to work fixing up the\r\nbasketball court. When a student showed up wearing new shoes.\r\n\r\nSo now it just tries to keep track of who's where and when. If someone\r\nleaves by the school-gates during classes, their gait is checked to see\r\nif it kinda-sorta matches any student gait and if it does,\r\nwhoop-whoop-whoop, ring the alarm!\r\n\r\nChavez High is ringed with gravel walkways. I like to keep a couple\r\nhandsful of rocks in my shoulder-bag, just in case. I silently passed\r\nDarryl ten or fifteen pointy little bastards and we both loaded our\r\nshoes.\r\n\r\nClass was about to finish up -- and I realized that I still hadn't\r\nchecked the Harajuku Fun Madness site to see where the next clue was!\r\nI'd been a little hyper-focused on the escape, and hadn't bothered to\r\nfigure out where we were escaping *to*.\r\n\r\nI turned to my SchoolBook and hit the keyboard. The web-browser we used\r\nwas supplied with the machine. It was a locked-down spyware version of\r\nInternet Explorer, Microsoft's crashware turd that no one under the age\r\nof 40 used voluntarily.\r\n\r\nI had a copy of Firefox on the USB drive built into my watch, but that\r\nwasn't enough -- the SchoolBook ran Windows Vista4Schools, an antique\r\noperating system designed to give school administrators the illusion\r\nthat they controlled the programs their students could run.\r\n\r\nBut Vista4Schools is its own worst enemy. There are a lot of programs\r\nthat Vista4Schools doesn't want you to be able to shut down --\r\nkeyloggers, censorware -- and these programs run in a special mode that\r\nmakes them invisible to the system. You can't quit them because you\r\ncan't even see they're there.\r\n\r\nAny program whose name starts with $SYS$ is invisible to the operating\r\nsystem. it doesn't show up on listings of the hard drive, nor in the\r\nprocess monitor. So my copy of Firefox was called $SYS$Firefox -- and\r\nas I launched it, it became invisible to Windows, and so invisible to\r\nthe network's snoopware.\r\n\r\nNow I had an indie browser running, I needed an indie network\r\nconnection. The school's network logged every click in and out of the\r\nsystem, which was bad news if you were planning on surfing over to the\r\nHarajuku Fun Madness site for some extra-curricular fun.\r\n\r\nThe answer is something ingenious called TOR -- The Onion Router. An\r\nonion router is an Internet site that takes requests for web-pages and\r\npasses them onto other onion routers, and on to other onion routers,\r\nuntil one of them finally decides to fetch the page and pass it back\r\nthrough the layers of the onion until it reaches you. The traffic to\r\nthe onion-routers is encrypted, which means that the school can't see\r\nwhat you're asking for, and the layers of the onion don't know who\r\nthey're working for. There are millions of  nodes -- the program was\r\nset up by the US Office of Naval Research to help their people get\r\naround the censorware in countries like Syria and China, which means\r\nthat it's perfectly designed for operating in the confines of an\r\naverage American high school.\r\n\r\nTOR works because the school has a finite blacklist of naughty\r\naddresses we aren't allowed to visit, and the addresses of the  nodes\r\nchange all the time -- no way could the school keep track of them all.\r\nFirefox and TOR together made me into the invisible man, impervious to\r\nBoard of Ed snooping, free to check out the Harajuku FM site and see\r\nwhat was up.\r\n\r\nThere it was, a new clue. Like all Harajuku Fun Madness clues, it had a\r\nphysical, online and mental component. The online component was a\r\npuzzle you had to solve, one that required you to research the answers\r\nto a bunch of obscure questions. This batch included a bunch of\r\nquestions on the plots in dojinshi -- those are comic books drawn by\r\nfans of manga, Japanese comics. They can be as big as the official\r\ncomics that inspire them, but they're a lot weirder, with crossover\r\nstory-lines and sometimes really silly songs and action. Lots of love\r\nstories, of course. Everyone loves to see their favorite toons hook up.\r\n\r\nI'd have to solve those riddles later, when I got home. They were\r\neasiest to solve with the whole team, downloading tons of dojinshi\r\nfiles and scouring them for answers to the puzzles.\r\n\r\nI'd just finished scrap-booking all the clues when the bell rang and we\r\nbegan our escape. I surreptitiously slid the gravel down the side of my\r\nshort boots -- ankle-high Blundstones from Australia, great for running\r\nand climbing, and the easy slip-on/slip-off laceless design makes them\r\nconvenient at the never-ending metal-detectors that are everywhere now.\r\n\r\nWe also had to evade physical surveillance, of course, but that gets\r\neasier every time they add a new layer of physical snoopery -- all the\r\nbells and whistles lull our beloved faculty into a totally false sense\r\nof security. We surfed the crowd down the hallways, heading for my\r\nfavorite side-exit. We were halfway along when Darryl hissed, \"Crap! I\r\nforgot, I've got a library book in my bag.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're kidding me,\" I said, and hauled him into the next bathroom we\r\npassed. Library books are bad news. Every one of them has an arphid --\r\nRadio Frequency ID tag -- glued into its binding, which makes it\r\npossible for the librarians to check out the books by waving them over\r\na reader, and lets a library shelf tell you if any of the books on it\r\nare out of place.\r\n\r\nBut it also lets the school track where you are at all times. It was\r\nanother of those legal loopholes: the courts wouldn't let the schools\r\ntrack *us* with arphids, but they could track *library books*, and use\r\nthe school records to tell them who was likely to be carrying which\r\nlibrary book.\r\n\r\nI had a little Faraday pouch in my bag -- these are little wallets\r\nlined with a mesh of copper wires that effectively block radio energy,\r\nsilencing arphids. But the pouches were made for neutralizing ID cards\r\nand toll-booth transponders, not books like --\r\n\r\n\"Introduction to Physics?\" I groaned. The book was the size of a\r\ndictionary.\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nChapter 2\r\n\r\n[[This chapter is dedicated to Amazon.com, the largest Internet\r\nbookseller in the world. Amazon is *amazing* -- a \"store\" where you can\r\nget practically any book ever published (along with practically\r\neverything else, from laptops to cheese-graters), where they've\r\nelevated recommendations to a high art, where they allow customers to\r\ndirectly communicate with each other, where they are constantly\r\ninventing new and better ways of connecting books with readers. Amazon\r\nhas always treated me like gold -- the founder, Jeff Bezos, even posted\r\na reader-review for my first novel! -- and I shop there like crazy\r\n(looking at my spreadsheets, it appears that I buy something from\r\nAmazon approximately every *six days*). Amazon's in the process of\r\nreinventing what it means to be a bookstore in the twenty-first century\r\nand I can't think of a better group of people to be facing down that\r\nthorny set of problems.]]\r\n\r\n[[Amazon:\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0765319853/downandoutint-20]]\r\n\r\n\"I'm thinking of majoring in physics when I go to Berkeley,\" Darryl\r\nsaid. His dad taught at the University of California at Berkeley, which\r\nmeant he'd get free tuition when he went. And there'd never been any\r\nquestion in Darryl's household about whether he'd go.\r\n\r\n\"Fine, but couldn't you research it online?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dad said I should read it. Besides, I didn't plan on committing any\r\ncrimes today.\"\r\n\r\n\"Skipping school isn't a crime. It's an infraction. They're totally\r\ndifferent.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are we going to do, Marcus?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I can't hide it, so I'm going to have to nuke it.\" Killing\r\narphids is a dark art. No merchant wants malicious customers going for\r\na walk around the shop-floor and leaving behind a bunch of lobotomized\r\nmerchandise that is missing its invisible bar-code, so the\r\nmanufacturers have refused to implement a \"kill signal\" that you can\r\nradio to an arphid to get it to switch off. You can reprogram arphids\r\nwith the right box, but I hate doing that to library books. It's not\r\nexactly tearing pages out of a book, but it's still bad, since a book\r\nwith a reprogrammed arphid can't be shelved and can't be found. It just\r\nbecomes a needle in a haystack.\r\n\r\nThat left me with only one option: nuking the thing. Literally. 30\r\nseconds in a microwave will do in pretty much every arphid on the\r\nmarket. And because the arphid wouldn't answer at all when D checked it\r\nback in at the library, they'd just print a fresh one for it and recode\r\nit with the book's catalog info, and it would end up clean and neat\r\nback on its shelf.\r\n\r\nAll we needed was a microwave.\r\n\r\n\"Give it another two minutes and the teacher's lounge will be empty,\" I\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nDarryl grabbed his book at headed for the door. \"Forget it, no way. I'm\r\ngoing to class.\"\r\n\r\nI snagged his elbow and dragged him back. \"Come on, D, easy now. It'll\r\nbe fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"The *teacher's lounge*? Maybe you weren't listening, Marcus. If I get\r\nbusted *just once more*, I am *expelled.* You hear that? *Expelled.*\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't get caught,\" I said. The one place a teacher wouldn't be\r\nafter this period was the lounge. \"We'll go in the back way.\" The\r\nlounge had a little kitchenette off to one side, with its own entrance\r\nfor teachers who just wanted to pop in and get a cup of joe. The\r\nmicrowave -- which always reeked of popcorn and spilled soup -- was\r\nright in there, on top of the miniature fridge.\r\n\r\nDarryl groaned. I thought fast. \"Look, the bell's *already rung*. if\r\nyou go to study hall now, you'll get a late-slip. Better not to show at\r\nall at this point. I can infiltrate and exfiltrate any room on this\r\ncampus, D. You've seen me do it. I'll keep you safe, bro.\"\r\n\r\nHe groaned again. That was one of Darryl's tells: once he starts\r\ngroaning, he's ready to give in.\r\n\r\n\"Let's roll,\" I said, and we took off.\r\n\r\nIt was flawless. We skirted the classrooms, took the back stairs into\r\nthe basement, and came up the front stairs right in front of the\r\nteachers' lounge. Not a sound came from the door, and I quietly turned\r\nthe knob and dragged Darryl in before silently closing the door.\r\n\r\nThe book just barely fit in the microwave, which was looking even less\r\nsanitary than it had the last time I'd popped in here to use it. I\r\nconscientiously wrapped it in paper towels before I set it down. \"Man,\r\nteachers are *pigs*,\" I hissed. Darryl, white faced and tense, said\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nThe arphid died in a shower of sparks, which was really quite lovely\r\n(though not nearly as pretty as the effect you get when you nuke a\r\nfrozen grape, which has to be seen to be believed).\r\n\r\nNow, to exfiltrate the campus in perfect anonymity and make our escape.\r\n\r\nDarryl opened the door and began to move out, me on his heels. A second\r\nlater, he was standing on my toes, elbows jammed into my chest, as he\r\ntried to back-pedal into the closet-sized kitchen we'd just left.\r\n\r\n\"Get back,\" he whispered urgently. \"Quick -- it's Charles!\"\r\n\r\nCharles Walker and I don't get along. We're in the same grade, and\r\nwe've known each other as long as I've known Darryl, but that's where\r\nthe resemblance ends. Charles has always been big for his age, and now\r\nthat he's playing football and on the juice, he's even bigger. He's got\r\nanger management problems -- I lost a milk-tooth to him in the third\r\ngrade, and he's managed to keep from getting in trouble over them by\r\nbecoming the most active snitch in school.\r\n\r\nIt's a bad combination, a bully who also snitches, taking great\r\npleasure in going to the teachers with whatever infractions he's found.\r\nBenson *loved* Charles. Charles liked to let on that he had some kind\r\nof unspecified bladder problem, which gave him a ready-made excuse to\r\nprowl the hallways at Chavez, looking for people to fink on.\r\n\r\nThe last time Charles had caught some dirt on me, it had ended with me\r\ngiving up LARPing. I had no intention of being caught by him again.\r\n\r\n\"What's he doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's coming this way is what he's doing,\" Darryl said. He was shaking.\r\n\r\n\"OK,\" I said. \"OK, time for emergency countermeasures.\" I got my phone\r\nout. I'd planned this well in advance. Charles would never get me\r\nagain. I emailed my server at home, and it got into motion.\r\n\r\nA few seconds later, Charles's phone spazzed out spectacularly. I'd had\r\ntens of thousands of simultaneous random calls and text messages sent\r\nto it, causing every chirp and ring it had to go off and keep on going\r\noff. The attack was accomplished by means of a botnet, and for that I\r\nfelt bad, but it was in the service of a good cause.\r\n\r\nBotnets are where infected computers spend their afterlives. When you\r\nget a worm or a virus, your computer sends a message to a chat channel\r\non IRC -- the Internet Relay Chat. That message tells the botmaster --\r\nthe guy who deployed the worm -- that the computers are there ready to\r\ndo his bidding. Botnets are supremely powerful, since they can comprise\r\nthousands, even hundreds of thousands of computers, scattered all over\r\nthe Internet, connected to juicy high-speed connections and running on\r\nfast home PCs. Those PCs normally function on behalf of their owners,\r\nbut when the botmaster calls them, they rise like zombies to do his\r\nbidding.\r\n\r\nThere are so many infected PCs on the Internet that the price of hiring\r\nan hour or two on a botnet has crashed. Mostly these things work for\r\nspammers as cheap, distributed spambots, filling your mailbox with\r\ncome-ons for boner-pills or with new viruses that can infect you and\r\nrecruit your machine to join the botnet.\r\n\r\nI'd just rented 10 seconds' time on three thousand PCs and had each of\r\nthem send a text message or voice-over-IP call to Charles's phone,\r\nwhose number I'd extracted from a sticky note on Benson's desk during\r\none fateful office-visit.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, Charles's phone was not equipped to handle this. First\r\nthe SMSes filled the memory on his phone, causing it to start choking\r\non the routine operations it needed to do things like manage the ringer\r\nand log all those incoming calls' bogus return numbers (did you know\r\nthat it's *really easy* to fake the return number on a caller ID? There\r\nare about fifty ways of doing it -- just google \"spoof caller id\").\r\n\r\nCharles stared at it dumbfounded, and jabbed at it furiously, his thick\r\neyebrows knotting and wiggling as he struggled with the demons that had\r\npossessed his most personal of devices. The plan was working so far,\r\nbut he wasn't doing what he was supposed to be doing next -- he was\r\nsupposed to go find some place to sit down and try to figure out how to\r\nget his phone back. Darryl shook me by the shoulder, and I pulled my\r\neye away from the crack in the door.\r\n\r\n\"What's he doing?\" Darryl whispered.\r\n\r\n\"I totaled his phone, but he's just staring at it now instead of moving\r\non.\" It wasn't going to be easy to reboot that thing. Once the memory\r\nwas totally filled, it would have a hard time loading the code it\r\nneeded to delete the bogus messages -- and there was no bulk-erase for\r\ntexts on his phone, so he'd have to manually delete all of the\r\nthousands of messages.\r\n\r\nDarryl shoved me back and stuck his eye up to the door. A moment later,\r\nhis shoulders started to shake. I got scared, thinking he was\r\npanicking, but when he pulled back, I saw that he was laughing so hard\r\nthat tears were streaming down his cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"Galvez just totally busted him for being in the halls during class\r\n*and* for having his phone out -- you should have seen her tear into\r\nhim. She was really enjoying it.\"\r\n\r\nWe shook hands solemnly and snuck back out of the corridor, down the\r\nstairs, around the back, out the door, past the fence and out into the\r\nglorious sunlight of afternoon in the Mission. Valencia Street had\r\nnever looked so good. I checked my watch and yelped.\r\n\r\n\"Let's move! The rest of the gang is meeting us at the cable-cars in\r\ntwenty minutes!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVan spotted us first. She was blending in with a group of Korean\r\ntourists, which is one of her favorite ways of camouflaging herself\r\nwhen she's ditching school. Ever since the truancy moblog went live,\r\nour world is full of nosy shopkeepers and pecksniffs who take it upon\r\nthemselves to snap our piccies and put them on the net where they can\r\nbe perused by school administrators.\r\n\r\nShe came out of the crowd and bounded toward us. Darryl has had a thing\r\nfor Van since forever, and she's sweet enough to pretend she doesn't\r\nknow it. She gave me a hug and then moved onto Darryl, giving him a\r\nquick sisterly kiss on the cheek that made him go red to the tops of\r\nhis ears.\r\n\r\nThe two of them made a funny pair: Darryl is a little on the heavy\r\nside, though he wears it well, and he's got a kind of pink complexion\r\nthat goes red in the cheeks whenever he runs or gets excited. He's been\r\nable to grow a beard since we were 14, but thankfully he started\r\nshaving after a brief period known to our gang as \"the Lincoln years.\"\r\nAnd he's tall. Very, very tall. Like basketball player tall.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Van is half a head shorter than me, and skinny, with\r\nstraight black hair that she wears in crazy, elaborate braids that she\r\nresearches on the net. She's got pretty coppery skin and dark eyes, and\r\nshe loves big glass rings the size of radishes, which click and clack\r\ntogether when she dances.\r\n\r\n\"Where's Jolu?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"How are you, Van?\" Darryl asked in a choked voice. He always ran a\r\nstep behind the conversation when it came to Van.\r\n\r\n\"I'm great, D. How's your every little thing?\" Oh, she was a bad, bad\r\nperson. Darryl nearly fainted.\r\n\r\nJolu saved him from social disgrace by showing up just then, in an\r\noversize leather baseball jacket, sharp sneakers, and a meshback cap\r\nadvertising our favorite Mexican masked wrestler, El Santo Junior. Jolu\r\nis Jose Luis Torrez, the completing member of our foursome. He went to\r\na super-strict Catholic school in the Outer Richmond, so it wasn't easy\r\nfor him to get out. But he always did: no one exfiltrated like our\r\nJolu. He liked his jacket because it hung down low -- which was pretty\r\nstylish in parts of the city -- and covered up all his Catholic school\r\ncrap, which was like a bulls-eye for nosy jerks with the truancy moblog\r\nbookmarked on their phones.\r\n\r\n\"Who's ready to go?\" I asked, once we'd all said hello. I pulled out my\r\nphone and showed them the map I'd downloaded to it on the BART. \"Near\r\nas I can work out, we wanna go up to the Nikko again, then one block\r\npast it to O'Farrell, then left up toward Van Ness. Somewhere in there\r\nwe should find the wireless signal.\"\r\n\r\nVan made a face. \"That's a nasty part of the Tenderloin.\" I couldn't\r\nargue with her. That part of San Francisco is one of the weird bits --\r\nyou go in through the Hilton's front entrance and it's all touristy\r\nstuff like the cable-car turnaround and family restaurants. Go through\r\nto the other side and you're in the 'Loin, where every tracked out\r\ntransvestite hooker, hard-case pimp, hissing drug dealer and cracked up\r\nhomeless person in town was concentrated. What they bought and sold,\r\nnone of us were old enough to be a part of (though there were plenty of\r\nhookers our age plying their trade in the 'Loin.)\r\n\r\n\"Look on the bright side,\" I said. \"The only time you want to go up\r\naround there is broad daylight. None of the other players are going to\r\ngo near it until tomorrow at the earliest. This is what we in the ARG\r\nbusiness call a *monster head start.*\"\r\n\r\nJolu grinned at me. \"You make it sound like a good thing,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Beats eating uni,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"We going to talk or we going to win?\" Van said. After me, she was\r\nhands-down the most hardcore player in our group. She took winning\r\nvery, very seriously.\r\n\r\nWe struck out, four good friends, on our way to decode a clue, win the\r\ngame -- and lose everything we cared about, forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe physical component of today's clue was a set of GPS coordinates --\r\nthere were coordinates for all the major cities where Harajuku Fun\r\nMadness was played -- where we'd find a WiFi access-point's signal.\r\nThat signal was being deliberately jammed by another, nearby WiFi point\r\nthat was hidden so that it couldn't be spotted by conventional\r\nwifinders, little key-fobs that told you when you were within range of\r\nsomeone's open access-point, which you could use for free.\r\n\r\nWe'd have to track down the location of the \"hidden\" access point by\r\nmeasuring the strength of the \"visible\" one, finding the spot where it\r\nwas most mysteriously weakest. There we'd find another clue -- last\r\ntime it had been in the special of the day at Anzu, the swanky sushi\r\nrestaurant in the Nikko hotel in the Tenderloin. The Nikko was owned by\r\nJapan Airlines, one of Harajuku Fun Madness's sponsors, and the staff\r\nhad all made a big fuss over us when we finally tracked down the clue.\r\nThey'd given us bowls of miso soup and made us try uni, which is sushi\r\nmade from sea urchin, with the texture of very runny cheese and a smell\r\nlike very runny dog-droppings. But it tasted *really* good. Or so\r\nDarryl told me. I wasn't going to eat that stuff.\r\n\r\nI picked up the WiFi signal with my phone's wifinder about three blocks\r\nup O'Farrell, just before Hyde Street, in front of a dodgy \"Asian\r\nMassage Parlor\" with a red blinking CLOSED sign in the window. The\r\nnetwork's name was HarajukuFM, so we knew we had the right spot.\r\n\r\n\"If it's in there, I'm not going,\" Darryl said.\r\n\r\n\"You all got your wifinders?\" I said.\r\n\r\nDarryl and Van had phones with built-in wifinders, while Jolu, being\r\ntoo cool to carry a phone bigger than his pinky finger, had a separate\r\nlittle directional fob.\r\n\r\n\"OK, fan out and see what we see. You're looking for a sharp drop off\r\nin the signal that gets worse the more you move along it.\"\r\n\r\nI took a step backward and ended up standing on someone's toes. A\r\nfemale voice said \"oof\" and I spun around, worried that some crack-ho\r\nwas going to stab me for breaking her heels.\r\n\r\nInstead, I found myself face to face with another kid my age. She had a\r\nshock of bright pink hair and a sharp, rodent-like face, with big\r\nsunglasses that were practically air-force goggles. She was dressed in\r\nstriped tights beneath a black granny dress, with lots of little\r\nJapanese decorer toys safety pinned to it -- anime characters, old\r\nworld leaders, emblems from foreign soda-pop.\r\n\r\nShe held up a camera and snapped a picture of me and my crew.\r\n\r\n\"Cheese,\" she said. \"You're on candid snitch-cam.\"\r\n\r\n\"No way,\" I said. \"You wouldn't --\"\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" she said. \"I will send this photo to truant watch in thirty\r\nseconds unless you four back off from this clue and let me and my\r\nfriends here run it down. You can come back in one hour and it'll be\r\nall yours. I think that's more than fair.\"\r\n\r\nI looked behind her and noticed three other girls in similar garb --\r\none with blue hair, one with green, and one with purple. \"Who are you\r\nsupposed to be, the Popsicle Squad?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're the team that's going to kick your team's ass at Harajuku Fun\r\nMadness,\" she said. \"And I'm the one who's *right this second* about to\r\nupload your photo and get you in *so much trouble* --\"\r\n\r\nBehind me I felt Van start forward. Her all-girls school was notorious\r\nfor its brawls, and I was pretty sure she was ready to knock this\r\nchick's block off.\r\n\r\nThen the world changed forever.\r\n\r\nWe felt it first, that sickening lurch of the cement under your feet\r\nthat every Californian knows  instinctively -- *earthquake*. My first\r\ninclination, as always, was to get away: \"when in trouble or in doubt,\r\nrun in circles, scream and shout.\" But the fact was, we were already in\r\nthe safest place we could be, not in a building that could fall in on\r\nus, not out toward the middle of the road where bits of falling cornice\r\ncould brain us.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes are eerily quiet -- at first, anyway -- but this wasn't\r\nquiet. This was loud, an incredible roaring sound that was louder than\r\nanything I'd ever heard before. The sound was so punishing it drove me\r\nto my knees, and I wasn't the only one. Darryl shook my arm and pointed\r\nover the buildings and we saw it then: a huge black cloud rising from\r\nthe northeast, from the direction of the Bay.\r\n\r\nThere was another rumble, and the cloud of smoke spread out, that\r\nspreading black shape we'd all grown up seeing in movies. Someone had\r\njust blown up something, in a big way.\r\n\r\nThere were more rumbles and more tremors. Heads appeared at windows up\r\nand down the street. We all looked at the mushroom cloud in silence.\r\n\r\nThen the sirens started.\r\n\r\nI'd heard sirens like these before -- they test the civil defense\r\nsirens at noon on Tuesdays. But I'd only heard them go off unscheduled\r\nin old war movies and video games, the kind where someone is bombing\r\nsomeone else from above. Air raid sirens. The wooooooo sound made it\r\nall less real.\r\n\r\n\"Report to shelters immediately.\" It was like the voice of God, coming\r\nfrom all places at once. There were speakers on some of the electric\r\npoles, something I'd never noticed before, and they'd all switched on\r\nat once.\r\n\r\n\"Report to shelters immediately.\" Shelters? We looked at each other in\r\nconfusion. What shelters? The cloud was rising steadily, spreading out.\r\nWas it nuclear? Were we breathing in our last breaths?\r\n\r\nThe girl with the pink hair grabbed her friends and they tore ass\r\ndownhill, back toward the BART station and the foot of the hills.\r\n\r\n\"REPORT TO SHELTERS IMMEDIATELY.\" There was screaming now, and a lot of\r\nrunning around. Tourists -- you can always spot the tourists, they're\r\nthe ones who think CALIFORNIA = WARM and spend their San Francisco\r\nholidays freezing in shorts and t-shirts -- scattered in every\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\"We should go!\" Darryl hollered in my ear, just barely audible over the\r\nshrieking of the sirens, which had been joined by traditional police\r\nsirens. A dozen SFPD cruisers screamed past us.\r\n\r\n\"REPORT TO SHELTERS IMMEDIATELY.\"\r\n\r\n\"Down to the BART station,\" I hollered. My friends nodded. We closed\r\nranks and began to move quickly downhill.\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nChapter 3\r\n\r\n[[This chapter is dedicated to Borderlands Books, San Francisco's\r\nmagnificent independent science fiction bookstore.

They were running or walking, white-faced and silent or shouting\r\nand panicked. Homeless people cowered in doorways and watched it all,\r\nwhile a tall black tranny hooker shouted at two mustached young men\r\nabout something.\r\n\r\nThe closer we got to the BART, the worse the press of bodies became. By\r\nthe time we reached the stairway down into the station, it was a\r\nmob-scene, a huge brawl of people trying to crowd their way down a\r\nnarrow staircase. I had my face crushed up against someone's back, and\r\nsomeone else was pressed into my back.\r\n\r\nDarryl was still beside me -- he was big enough that he was hard to\r\nshove, and Jolu was right behind him, kind of hanging on to his waist.\r\nI spied Vanessa a few yards away, trapped by more people.\r\n\r\n\"Screw you!\" I heard Van yell behind me. \"Pervert! Get your hands off\r\nof me!\"\r\n\r\nI strained around against the crowd and saw Van looking with disgust at\r\nan older guy in a nice suit who was kind of smirking at her. She was\r\ndigging in her purse and I knew what she was digging for.\r\n\r\n\"Don't mace him!\" I shouted over the din. \"You'll get us all too.\"\r\n\r\nAt the mention of the word mace, the guy looked scared and kind of\r\nmelted back, though the crowd kept him moving forward. Up ahead, I saw\r\nsomeone, a middle-aged lady in a hippie dress, falter and fall. She\r\nscreamed as she went down, and I saw her thrashing to get up, but she\r\ncouldn't, the crowd's pressure was too strong. As I neared her, I bent\r\nto help her up, and was nearly knocked over her. I ended up stepping on\r\nher stomach as the crowd pushed me past her, but by then I don't think\r\nshe was feeling anything.\r\n\r\nI was as scared as I'd ever been. There was screaming everywhere now,\r\nand more bodies on the floor, and the press from behind was as\r\nrelentless as a bulldozer. It was all I could do to keep on my feet.\r\n\r\nWe were in the open concourse where the turnstiles were. It was hardly\r\nany better here -- the enclosed space sent the voices around us echoing\r\nback in a roar that made my head ring, and the smell and feeling of all\r\nthose bodies made me feel a claustrophobia I'd never known I was prone\r\nto.\r\n\r\nPeople were still cramming down the stairs, and more were squeezing\r\npast the turnstiles and down the escalators onto the platforms, but it\r\nwas clear to me that this wasn't going to have a happy ending.\r\n\r\n\"Want to take our chances up top?\" I said to Darryl.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, hell yes,\" he said. \"This is vicious.\"\r\n\r\nI looked to Vanessa -- there was no way she'd hear me. I managed to get\r\nmy phone out and I texted her.\r\n\r\n> We're getting out of here\r\n\r\nI saw her feel the vibe from her phone, then look down at it and then\r\nback at me and nod vigorously. Darryl, meanwhile, had clued Jolu in.\r\n\r\n\"*What's the plan?* Darryl shouted in my ear.\r\n\r\n\"We're going to have to go back!\" I shouted back, pointing at the\r\nremorseless crush of bodies.\r\n\r\n\"It's impossible!\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"It's just going to get more impossible the longer we wait!\"\r\n\r\nHe shrugged. Van worked her way over to me and grabbed hold of my\r\nwrist. I took Darryl and Darryl took Jolu by the other hand and we\r\npushed out.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't easy. We moved about three inches a minute at first, then\r\nslowed down even more when we reached the stairway. The people we\r\npassed were none too happy about us shoving them out of the way,\r\neither. A couple people swore at us and there was a guy who looked like\r\nhe'd have punched me if he'd been able to get his arms loose. We passed\r\nthree more crushed people beneath us, but there was no way I could have\r\nhelped them. By that point, I wasn't even thinking of helping anyone.\r\nAll I could think of was finding the spaces in front of us to move\r\ninto, of Darryl's mighty straining on my wrist, of my death-grip on Van\r\nbehind me.\r\n\r\nWe popped free like Champagne corks an eternity later, blinking in the\r\ngrey smoky light. The air raid sirens were still blaring, and the sound\r\nof emergency vehicles' sirens as they tore down Market Street was even\r\nlouder. There was almost no one on the streets anymore -- just the\r\npeople trying hopelessly to get underground. A lot of them were crying.\r\nI spotted a bunch of empty benches -- usually staked out by skanky\r\nwinos -- and pointed toward them.\r\n\r\nWe moved for them, the sirens and the smoke making us duck and hunch\r\nour shoulders. We got as far as the benches before Darryl fell forward.\r\n\r\nWe all yelled and Vanessa grabbed him and turned him over. The side of\r\nhis shirt was stained red, and the stain was spreading. She tugged his\r\nshirt up and revealed a long, deep cut in his pudgy side.\r\n\r\n\"Someone freaking *stabbed* him in the crowd,\" Jolu said, his hands\r\nclenching into fists. \"Christ, that's vicious.\"\r\n\r\nDarryl groaned and looked at us, then down at his side, then he groaned\r\nand his head went back again.\r\n\r\nVanessa took off her jean jacket and then pulled off the cotton hoodie\r\nshe was wearing underneath it. She wadded it up and pressed it to\r\nDarryl's side. \"Take his head,\" she said to me. \"Keep it elevated.\" To\r\nJolu she said, \"Get his feet up -- roll up your coat or something.\"\r\nJolu moved quickly. Vanessa's mother is a nurse and she'd had first aid\r\ntraining every summer at camp. She loved to watch people in movies get\r\ntheir first aid wrong and make fun of them. I was so glad to have her\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\nWe sat there for a long time, holding the hoodie to Darryl's side. He\r\nkept insisting that he was fine and that we should let him up, and Van\r\nkept telling him to shut up and lie still before she kicked his ass.\r\n\r\n\"What about calling 911?\" Jolu said.\r\n\r\nI felt like an idiot. I whipped my phone out and punched 911. The sound\r\nI got wasn't even a busy signal -- it was like a whimper of pain from\r\nthe phone system. You don't get sounds like that unless there's three\r\nmillion people all dialing the same number at once. Who needs botnets\r\nwhen you've got terrorists?\r\n\r\n\"What about Wikipedia?\" Jolu said.\r\n\r\n\"No phone, no data,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"What about them?\" Darryl said, and pointed at the street. I looked\r\nwhere he was pointing, thinking I'd see a cop or an paramedic, but\r\nthere was no one there.\r\n\r\n\"It's OK buddy, you just rest,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"No, you idiot, what about *them*, the cops in the cars? There!\"\r\n\r\nHe was right. Every five seconds, a cop car, an ambulance or a\r\nfiretruck zoomed past. They could get us some help. I was such an\r\nidiot.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, then,\" I said, \"let's get you where they can see you and flag\r\none down.\"\r\n\r\nVanessa didn't like it, but I figured a cop wasn't going to stop for a\r\nkid waving his hat in the street, not that day. They just might stop if\r\nthey saw Darryl bleeding there, though. I argued briefly with her and\r\nDarryl settled it by lurching to his feet and dragging himself down\r\ntoward Market Street.\r\n\r\nThe first vehicle that screamed past -- an ambulance -- didn't even\r\nslow down. Neither did the cop car that went past, nor the firetruck,\r\nnor the next three cop-cars. Darryl wasn't in good shape -- he was\r\nwhite-faced and panting. Van's sweater was soaked in blood.\r\n\r\nI was sick of cars driving right past me. The next time a car appeared\r\ndown Market Street, I stepped right out into the road, waving my arms\r\nover my head, shouting \"*STOP*.\" The car slewed to a stop and only then\r\ndid I notice that it wasn't a cop car, ambulance or fire-engine.\r\n\r\nIt was a military-looking Jeep, like an armored Hummer, only it didn't\r\nhave any military insignia on it. The car skidded to a stop just in\r\nfront of me, and I jumped back and lost my balance and ended up on the\r\nroad. I felt the doors open near me, and then saw a confusion of booted\r\nfeet moving close by. I looked up and saw a bunch of military-looking\r\nguys in coveralls, holding big, bulky rifles and wearing hooded gas\r\nmasks with tinted face-plates.\r\n\r\nI barely had time to register them before those rifles were pointed at\r\nme. I'd never looked down the barrel of a gun before, but everything\r\nyou've heard about the experience is true. You freeze where you are,\r\ntime stops, and your heart thunders in your ears. I opened my mouth,\r\nthen shut it, then, very slowly, I held my hands up in front of me.\r\n\r\nThe faceless, eyeless armed man above me kept his gun very level. I\r\ndidn't even breathe. Van was screaming something and Jolu was shouting\r\nand I looked at them for a second and that was when someone put a\r\ncoarse sack over my head and cinched it tight around my windpipe, so\r\nquick and so fiercely I barely had time to gasp before it was locked on\r\nme. I was pushed roughly but dispassionately onto my stomach and\r\nsomething went twice around my wrists and then tightened up as well,\r\nfeeling like baling wire and biting cruelly. I cried out and my own\r\nvoice was muffled by the hood.\r\n\r\nI was in total darkness now and I strained my ears to hear what was\r\ngoing on with my friends. I heard them shouting through the muffling\r\ncanvas of the bag, and then I was being impersonally hauled to my feet\r\nby my wrists, my arms wrenched up behind my back, my shoulders\r\nscreaming.\r\n\r\nI stumbled some, then a hand pushed my head down and I was inside the\r\nHummer. More bodies were roughly shoved in beside me.\r\n\r\n\"Guys?\" I shouted, and earned a hard thump on my head for my trouble. I\r\nheard Jolu respond, then felt the thump he was dealt, too. My head rang\r\nlike a gong.\r\n\r\n\"Hey,\" I said to the soldiers. \"Hey, listen! We're just high school\r\nstudents. I wanted to flag you down because my friend was bleeding.\r\nSomeone stabbed him.\" I had no idea how much of this was making it\r\nthrough the muffling bag. I kept talking. \"Listen -- this is some kind\r\nof misunderstanding. We've got to get my friend to a hospital --\"\r\n\r\nSomeone went upside my head again. It felt like they used a baton or\r\nsomething -- it was harder than anyone had ever hit me in the head\r\nbefore. My eyes swam and watered and I literally couldn't breathe\r\nthrough the pain. A moment later, I caught my breath, but I didn't say\r\nanything. I'd learned my lesson.\r\n\r\nWho were these clowns? They weren't wearing insignia. Maybe they were\r\nterrorists! I'd never really believed in terrorists before -- I mean, I\r\nknew that in the abstract there were terrorists somewhere in the world,\r\nbut they didn't really represent any risk to me. There were millions of\r\nways that the world could kill me -- starting with getting run down by\r\na drunk burning his way down Valencia -- that were infinitely more\r\nlikely and immediate than terrorists. Terrorists killed a lot fewer\r\npeople than bathroom falls and accidental electrocutions. Worrying\r\nabout them always struck me as about as useful as worrying about\r\ngetting hit by lightning.\r\n\r\nSitting in the back of that Hummer, my head in a hood, my hands lashed\r\nbehind my back, lurching back and forth while the bruises swelled up on\r\nmy head, terrorism suddenly felt a lot riskier.\r\n\r\nThe car rocked back and forth and tipped uphill. I gathered we were\r\nheaded over Nob Hill, and from the angle, it seemed we were taking one\r\nof the steeper routes -- I guessed Powell Street.\r\n\r\nNow we were descending just as steeply. If my mental map was right, we\r\nwere heading down to Fisherman's Wharf. You could get on a boat there,\r\nget away. That fit with the terrorism hypothesis. Why the hell would\r\nterrorists kidnap a bunch of high school students?\r\n\r\nWe rocked to a stop still on a downslope. The engine died and then the\r\ndoors swung open. Someone dragged me by my arms out onto the road, then\r\nshoved me, stumbling, down a paved road. A few seconds later, I tripped\r\nover a steel staircase, bashing my shins. The hands behind me gave me\r\nanother shove. I went up the stairs cautiously, not able to use my\r\nhands. I got up the third step and reached for the fourth, but it\r\nwasn't there. I nearly fell again, but new hands grabbed me from in\r\nfront and dragged me down a steel floor and then forced me to my knees\r\nand locked my hands to something behind me.\r\n\r\nMore movement, and the sense of bodies being shackled in alongside of\r\nme. Groans and muffled sounds. Laughter. Then a long, timeless eternity\r\nin the muffled gloom, breathing my own breath, hearing my own breath in\r\nmy ears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI actually managed a kind of sleep there, kneeling with the circulation\r\ncut off to my legs, my head in canvas twilight. My body had squirted a\r\nyear's supply of adrenalin into my bloodstream in the space of 30\r\nminutes, and while that stuff can give you the strength to lift cars\r\noff your loved ones and leap over tall buildings, the payback's always\r\na bitch.\r\n\r\nI woke up to someone pulling the hood off my head. They were neither\r\nrough nor careful -- just...impersonal. Like someone at McDonald's\r\nputting together burgers.\r\n\r\nThe light in the room was so bright I had to squeeze my eyes shut, but\r\nslowly I was able to open them to slits, then cracks, then all the way\r\nand look around.\r\n\r\nWe were all in the back of a truck, a big 16-wheeler. I could see the\r\nwheel-wells at regular intervals down the length. But the back of this\r\ntruck had been turned into some kind of mobile command-post/jail. Steel\r\ndesks lined the walls with banks of slick flat-panel displays climbing\r\nabove them on articulated arms that let them be repositioned in a halo\r\naround the operators. Each desk had a gorgeous office-chair in front of\r\nit, festooned with user-interface knobs for adjusting every millimeter\r\nof the sitting surface, as well as height, pitch and yaw.\r\n\r\nThen there was the jail part -- at the front of the truck, furthest\r\naway from the doors, there were steel rails bolted into the sides of\r\nthe vehicle, and attached to these steel rails were the prisoners.\r\n\r\nI spotted Van and Jolu right away. Darryl might have been in the\r\nremaining dozen shackled up back here, but it was impossible to say --\r\nmany of them were slumped over and blocking my view. It stank of sweat\r\nand fear back there.\r\n\r\nVanessa looked at me and bit her lip. She was scared. So was I. So was\r\nJolu, his eyes rolling crazily in their sockets, the whites showing. I\r\nwas scared. What's more, I had to piss like a *race-horse.*\r\n\r\nI looked around for our captors. I'd avoided looking at them up until\r\nnow, the same way you don't look into the dark of a closet where your\r\nmind has conjured up a boogey-man. You don't want to know if you're\r\nright.\r\n\r\nBut I had to get a better look at these jerks who'd kidnapped us. If\r\nthey were terrorists, I wanted to know. I didn't know what a terrorist\r\nlooked like, though TV shows had done their best to convince me that\r\nthey were brown Arabs with big beards and knit caps and loose cotton\r\ndresses that hung down to their ankles.\r\n\r\nNot so our captors. They could have been half-time-show cheerleaders on\r\nthe Super Bowl. They looked *American* in a way I couldn't exactly\r\ndefine. Good jaw-lines, short, neat haircuts that weren't quite\r\nmilitary. They came in white and brown, male and female, and smiled\r\nfreely at one another as they sat down at the other end of the truck,\r\njoking and drinking coffees out of go-cups. These weren't Ay-rabs from\r\nAfghanistan: they looked like tourists from Nebraska.\r\n\r\nI stared at one, a young white woman with brown hair who barely looked\r\nolder than me, kind of cute in a scary office-power-suit way. If you\r\nstare at someone long enough, they'll eventually look back at you. She\r\ndid, and her face slammed into a totally different configuration,\r\ndispassionate, even robotic. The smile vanished in an instant.\r\n\r\n\"Hey,\" I said. \"Look, I don't understand what's going on here, but I\r\nreally need to take a leak, you know?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked right through me as if she hadn't heard.\r\n\r\n\"I'm serious, if I don't get to a can soon, I'm going to have an ugly\r\naccident. It's going to get pretty smelly back here, you know?\"\r\n\r\nShe turned to her colleagues, a little huddle of three of them, and\r\nthey held a low conversation I couldn't hear over the fans from the\r\ncomputers.\r\n\r\nShe turned back to me. \"Hold it for another ten minutes, then you'll\r\neach get a piss-call.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I've got another ten minutes in me,\" I said, letting a\r\nlittle more urgency than I was really feeling creep into my voice.\r\n\"Seriously, lady, it's now or never.\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head and looked at me like I was some kind of pathetic\r\nloser. She and her friends conferred some more, then another one came\r\nforward. He was older, in his early thirties, and pretty big across the\r\nshoulders, like he worked out. He looked like he was Chinese or Korean\r\n-- even Van can't tell the difference sometimes -- but with that\r\nbearing that said *American* in a way I couldn't put my finger on.\r\n\r\nHe pulled his sports-coat aside to let me see the hardware strapped\r\nthere: I recognized a pistol, a tazer and a can of either mace or\r\npepper-spray before he let it fall again.\r\n\r\n\"No trouble,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"None,\" I agreed.\r\n\r\nHe touched something at his belt and the shackles behind me let go, my\r\narms dropping suddenly behind me. It was like he was wearing Batman's\r\nutility belt -- wireless remotes for shackles! I guessed it made sense,\r\nthough: you wouldn't want to lean over your prisoners with all that\r\ndeadly hardware at their eye-level -- they might grab your gun with\r\ntheir teeth and pull the trigger with their tongues or something.\r\n\r\nMy hands were still lashed together behind me by the plastic strapping,\r\nand now that I wasn't supported by the shackles, I found that my legs\r\nhad turned into lumps of cork while I was stuck in one position. Long\r\nstory short, I basically fell onto my face and kicked my legs weakly as\r\nthey went pins-and-needles, trying to get them under me so I could rock\r\nup to my feet.\r\n\r\nThe guy jerked me to my feet and I clown-walked to the very back of the\r\ntruck, to a little boxed-in porta-john there. I tried to spot Darryl on\r\nthe way back, but he could have been any of the five or six slumped\r\npeople. Or none of them.\r\n\r\n\"In you go,\" the guy said.\r\n\r\nI jerked my wrists. \"Take these off, please?\" My fingers felt like\r\npurple sausages from the hours of bondage in the plastic cuffs.\r\n\r\nThe guy didn't move.\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" I said, trying not to sound sarcastic or angry (it wasn't\r\neasy). \"Look. You either cut my wrists free or you're going to have to\r\naim for me. A toilet visit is not a hands-free experience.\" Someone in\r\nthe truck sniggered. The guy didn't like me, I could tell from the way\r\nhis jaw muscles ground around. Man, these people were wired tight.\r\n\r\nHe reached down to his belt and came up with a very nice set of\r\nmulti-pliers. He flicked out a wicked-looking knife and sliced through\r\nthe plastic cuffs and my hands were my own again.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" I said.\r\n\r\nHe shoved me into the bathroom. My hands were useless, like lumps of\r\nclay on the ends of my wrists. As I wiggled my fingers limply, they\r\ntingled, then the tingling turned to a burning feeling that almost made\r\nme cry out. I put the seat down, dropped my pants and sat down. I\r\ndidn't trust myself to stay on my feet.\r\n\r\nAs my bladder cut loose, so did my eyes. I wept, crying silently and\r\nrocking back and forth while the tears and snot ran down my face. It\r\nwas all I could do to keep from sobbing -- I covered my mouth and held\r\nthe sounds in. I didn't want to give them the satisfaction.\r\n\r\nFinally, I was peed out and cried out and the guy was pounding on the\r\ndoor. I cleaned my face as best as I could with wads of toilet paper,\r\nstuck it all down the john and flushed, then looked around for a sink\r\nbut only found a pump-bottle of heavy-duty hand-sanitizer covered in\r\nsmall-print lists of the bio-agents it worked on. I rubbed some into my\r\nhands and stepped out of the john.\r\n\r\n\"What were you doing in there?\" the guy said.\r\n\r\n\"Using the facilities,\" I said. He turned me around and grabbed my\r\nhands and I felt a new pair of plastic cuffs go around them. My wrists\r\nhad swollen since the last pair had come off and the new ones bit\r\ncruelly into my tender skin, but I refused to give him the satisfaction\r\nof crying out.\r\n\r\nHe shackled me back to my spot and grabbed the next person down, who, I\r\nsaw now, was Jolu, his face puffy and an ugly bruise on his cheek.\r\n\r\n\"Are you OK?\" I asked him, and my friend with the utility belt abruptly\r\nput his hand on my forehead and shoved hard, bouncing the back of my\r\nhead off the truck's metal wall with a sound like a clock striking one.\r\n\"No talking,\" he said as I struggled to refocus my eyes.\r\n\r\nI didn't like these people. I decided right then that they would pay a\r\nprice for all this.\r\n\r\nOne by one, all the prisoners went to the can, and came back, and when\r\nthey were done, my guard went back to his friends and had another cup\r\nof coffee -- they were drinking out of a big cardboard urn of\r\nStarbucks, I saw -- and they had an indistinct conversation that\r\ninvolved a fair bit of laughter.\r\n\r\nThen the door at the back of the truck opened and there was fresh air,\r\nnot smoky the way it had been before, but tinged with ozone. In the\r\nslice of outdoors I saw before the door closed, I caught that it was\r\ndark out, and raining, with one of those San Francisco drizzles that's\r\npart mist.\r\n\r\nThe man who came in was wearing a military uniform. A US military\r\nuniform. He saluted the people in the truck and they saluted him back\r\nand that's when I knew that I wasn't a prisoner of some terrorists -- I\r\nwas a prisoner of the United States of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey set up a little screen at the end of the truck and then came for\r\nus one at a time, unshackling us and leading us to the back of the\r\ntruck. As close as I could work it -- counting seconds off in my head,\r\none hippopotami, two hippopotami -- the interviews lasted about seven\r\nminutes each. My head throbbed with dehydration and caffeine\r\nwithdrawal.\r\n\r\nI was third, brought back by the woman with the severe haircut. Up\r\nclose, she looked tired, with bags under her eyes and grim lines at the\r\ncorners of her mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" I said, automatically, as she unlocked me with a remote and\r\nthen dragged me to my feet. I hated myself for the automatic\r\npoliteness, but it had been drilled into me.\r\n\r\nShe didn't twitch a muscle. I went ahead of her to the back of the\r\ntruck and behind the screen. There was a single folding chair and I sat\r\nin it. Two of them -- Severe Haircut woman and utility belt man --\r\nlooked at me from their ergonomic super-chairs.\r\n\r\nThey had a little table between them with the contents of my wallet and\r\nbackpack spread out on it.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Marcus,\" Severe Haircut woman said. \"We have some questions for\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I under arrest?\" I asked. This wasn't an idle question. If you're\r\nnot under arrest, there are limits on what the cops can and can't do to\r\nyou. For starters, they can't hold you forever without arresting you,\r\ngiving you a phone call, and letting you talk to a lawyer. And hoo-boy,\r\nwas I ever going to talk to a lawyer.\r\n\r\n\"What's this for?\" she said, holding up my phone. The screen was\r\nshowing the error message you got if you kept trying to get into its\r\ndata without giving the right password. It was a bit of a rude message\r\n-- an animated hand giving a certain universally recognized gesture --\r\nbecause I liked to customize my gear.\r\n\r\n\"Am I under arrest?\" I repeated. They can't make you answer any\r\nquestions if you're not under arrest, and when you ask if you're under\r\narrest, they have to answer you. It's the rules.\r\n\r\n\"You're being detained by the Department of Homeland Security,\" the\r\nwoman snapped.\r\n\r\n\"Am I under arrest?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're going to be more cooperative, Marcus, starting right now.\" She\r\ndidn't say, \"or else,\" but it was implied.\r\n\r\n\"I would like to contact an attorney,\" I said. \"I would like to know\r\nwhat I've been charged with. I would like to see some form of\r\nidentification from both of you.\"\r\n\r\nThe two agents exchanged looks.\r\n\r\n\"I think you should really reconsider your approach to this situation,\"\r\nSevere Haircut woman said. \"I think you should do that right now. We\r\nfound a number of suspicious devices on your person. We found you and\r\nyour confederates near the site of the worst terrorist attack this\r\ncountry has ever seen. Put those two facts together and things don't\r\nlook very good for you, Marcus. You can cooperate, or you can be very,\r\nvery sorry. Now, what is this for?\"\r\n\r\n\"You think I'm a terrorist? I'm seventeen years old!\"\r\n\r\n\"Just the right age -- Al Qaeda loves recruiting impressionable,\r\nidealistic kids. We googled you, you know. You've posted a lot of very\r\nugly stuff on the public Internet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would like to speak to an attorney,\" I said.\r\n\r\nSevere haircut lady looked at me like I was a bug. \"You're under the\r\nmistaken impression that you've been picked up by the police for a\r\ncrime. You need to get past that. You are being detained as a potential\r\nenemy combatant by the government of the United States. If I were you,\r\nI'd be thinking very hard about how to convince us that you are not an\r\nenemy combatant. Very hard. Because there are dark holes that enemy\r\ncombatants can disappear into, very dark deep holes, holes where you\r\ncan just vanish. Forever. Are you listening to me young man? I want you\r\nto unlock this phone and then decrypt the files in its memory. I want\r\nyou to account for yourself: why were you out on the street? What do\r\nyou know about the attack on this city?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going to unlock my phone for you,\" I said, indignant. My\r\nphone's memory had all kinds of private stuff on it: photos, emails,\r\nlittle hacks and mods I'd installed. \"That's private stuff.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you got to hide?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got the right to my privacy,\" I said. \"And I want to speak to an\r\nattorney.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is your last chance, kid. Honest people don't have anything to\r\nhide.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to speak to an attorney.\" My parents would pay for it. All the\r\nFAQs on getting arrested were clear on this point. Just keep asking to\r\nsee an attorney, no matter what they say or do. There's no good that\r\ncomes of talking to the cops without your lawyer present. These two\r\nsaid they weren't cops, but if this wasn't an arrest, what was it?\r\n\r\nIn hindsight, maybe I should have unlocked my phone for them.\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nChapter 4\r\n\r\n[[This chapter is dedicated to Barnes and Noble, a US national chain of\r\nbookstores.

A long time later,\r\nthe truck started to move, rolling downhill, and then I was hauled back\r\nto my feet. I immediately fell over. My legs were so asleep they felt\r\nlike blocks of ice, all except my knees, which were swollen and tender\r\nfrom all the hours of kneeling.\r\n\r\nHands grabbed my shoulders and feet and I was picked up like a sack of\r\npotatoes. There were indistinct voices around me. Someone crying.\r\nSomeone cursing.\r\n\r\nI was carried a short distance, then set down and re-shackled to\r\nanother railing. My knees wouldn't support me anymore and I pitched\r\nforward, ending up twisted on the ground like a pretzel, straining\r\nagainst the chains holding my wrists.\r\n\r\nThen we were moving again, and this time, it wasn't like driving in a\r\ntruck. The floor beneath me rocked gently and vibrated with heavy\r\ndiesel engines and I realized I was on a ship! My stomach turned to\r\nice. I was being taken off America's shores to somewhere *else*, and\r\nwho the hell knew where that was? I'd been scared before, but this\r\nthought *terrified* me, left me paralyzed and wordless with fear. I\r\nrealized that I might never see my parents again and I actually tasted\r\na little vomit burn up my throat. The bag over my head closed in on me\r\nand I could barely breathe, something that was compounded by the weird\r\nposition I was twisted into.\r\n\r\nBut mercifully we weren't on the water for very long. It felt like an\r\nhour, but I know now that it was a mere fifteen minutes, and then I\r\nfelt us docking, felt footsteps on the decking around me and felt other\r\nprisoners being unshackled and carried or led away. When they came for\r\nme, I tried to stand again, but couldn't, and they carried me again,\r\nimpersonally, roughly.\r\n\r\nWhen they took the hood off again, I was in a cell.\r\n\r\nThe cell was old and crumbled, and smelled of sea air. There was one\r\nwindow high up, and rusted bars guarded it. It was still dark outside.\r\nThere was a blanket on the floor and a little metal toilet without a\r\nseat, set into the wall. The guard who took off my hood grinned at me\r\nand closed the solid steel door behind him.\r\n\r\nI gently massaged my legs, hissing as the blood came back into them and\r\ninto my hands. Eventually I was able to stand, and then to pace. I\r\nheard other people talking, crying, shouting. I did some shouting too:\r\n\"Jolu! Darryl! Vanessa!\" Other voices on the cell-block took up the\r\ncry, shouting out names, too, shouting out obscenities. The nearest\r\nvoices sounded like drunks losing their minds on a street-corner. Maybe\r\nI sounded like that too.\r\n\r\nGuards shouted at us to be quiet and that just made everyone yell\r\nlouder. Eventually we were all howling, screaming our heads off,\r\nscreaming our throats raw. Why not? What did we have to lose?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next time they came to question me, I was filthy and tired, thirsty\r\nand hungry. Severe haircut lady was in the new questioning party, as\r\nwere three big guys who moved me around like a cut of meat. One was\r\nblack, the other two were white, though one might have been hispanic.\r\nThey all carried guns. It was like a Benneton's ad crossed with a game\r\nof Counter-Strike.\r\n\r\nThey'd taken me from my cell and chained my wrists and ankles together.\r\nI paid attention to my surroundings as we went. I heard water outside\r\nand thought that maybe we were on Alcatraz -- it was a prison, after\r\nall, even if it had been a tourist attraction for generations, the\r\nplace where you went to see where Al Capone and his gangster\r\ncontemporaries did their time. But I'd been to Alcatraz on a school\r\ntrip. It was old and rusted, medieval. This place felt like it dated\r\nback to World War Two, not colonial times.\r\n\r\nThere were bar-codes laser-printed on stickers and placed on each of\r\nthe cell-doors, and numbers, but other than that, there was no way to\r\ntell who or what might be behind them.\r\n\r\nThe interrogation room was modern, with fluorescent lights, ergonomic\r\nchairs -- not for me, though, I got a folding plastic garden-chair --\r\nand a big wooden board-room table. A mirror lined one wall, just like\r\nin the cop shows, and I figured someone or other must be watching from\r\nbehind it. Severe haircut lady and her friends helped themselves to\r\ncoffees from an urn on a side-table (I could have torn her throat out\r\nwith my teeth and taken her coffee just then), and then set a styrofoam\r\ncup of water down next to me -- without unlocking my wrists from behind\r\nmy back, so I couldn't reach it. Hardy har har.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Marcus,\" Severe Haircut woman said. \"How's your 'tude doing\r\ntoday?\"\r\n\r\nI didn't say anything.\r\n\r\n\"This isn't as bad as it gets you know,\" she said. \"This is as *good*\r\nas it gets from now on. Even once you tell us what we want to know,\r\neven if that convinces us that you were just in the wrong place at the\r\nwrong time, you're a marked man now. We'll be watching you everywhere\r\nyou go and everything you do. You've acted like you've got something to\r\nhide, and we don't like that.\"\r\n\r\nIt's pathetic, but all my brain could think about was that phrase,\r\n\"convince us that you were in the wrong place at the wrong time.\" This\r\nwas the worst thing that had ever happened to me. I had never, ever\r\nfelt this bad or this scared before. Those words, \"wrong place at the\r\nwrong time,\" those six words, they were like a lifeline dangling before\r\nme as I thrashed to stay on the surface.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Marcus?\" she snapped her fingers in front of my face. \"Over\r\nhere, Marcus.\" There was a little smile on her face and I hated myself\r\nfor letting her see my fear. \"Marcus, it can be a lot worse than this.\r\nThis isn't the worst place we can put you, not by a damned sight.\" She\r\nreached down below the table and came out with a briefcase, which she\r\nsnapped open. From it, she withdrew my phone, my arphid sniper/cloner,\r\nmy wifinder, and my memory keys. She set them down on the table one\r\nafter the other.\r\n\r\n\"Here's what we want from you. You unlock the phone for us today. If\r\nyou do that, you'll get outdoor and bathing privileges. You'll get a\r\nshower and you'll be allowed to walk around in the exercise yard.\r\nTomorrow, we'll bring you back and ask you to decrypt the data on these\r\nmemory sticks. Do that, and you'll get to eat in the mess hall. The day\r\nafter, we're going to want your email passwords, and that will get you\r\nlibrary privileges.\"\r\n\r\nThe word \"no\" was on my lips, like a burp trying to come up, but it\r\nwouldn't come. \"Why?\" is what came out instead.\r\n\r\n\"We want to be sure that you're what you seem to be. This is about your\r\nsecurity, Marcus. Say you're innocent. You might be, though why an\r\ninnocent man would act like he's got so much to hide is beyond me. But\r\nsay you are: you could have been on that bridge when it blew. Your\r\nparents could have been. Your friends. Don't you want us to catch the\r\npeople who attacked your home?\"\r\n\r\nIt's funny, but when she was talking about my getting \"privileges\" it\r\nscared me into submission. I felt like I'd done *something* to end up\r\nwhere I was, like maybe it was partially my fault, like I could do\r\nsomething to change it.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as she switched to this BS about \"safety\" and \"security,\"\r\nmy spine came back. \"Lady,\" I said, \"you're talking about attacking my\r\nhome, but as far as I can tell, you're the only one who's attacked me\r\nlately. I thought I lived in a country with a constitution. I thought I\r\nlived in a country where I had *rights*. You're talking about defending\r\nmy freedom by tearing up the Bill of Rights.\"\r\n\r\nA flicker of annoyance passed over her face, then went away. \"So\r\nmelodramatic, Marcus. No one's attacked you. You've been detained by\r\nyour country's government while we seek details on the worst terrorist\r\nattack ever perpetrated on our nation's soil. You have it within your\r\npower to help us fight this war on our nation's enemies. You want to\r\npreserve the Bill of Rights? Help us stop bad people from blowing up\r\nyour city. Now, you have exactly thirty seconds to unlock that phone\r\nbefore I send you back to your cell. We have lots of other people to\r\ninterview today.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at her watch. I rattled my wrists, rattled the chains that\r\nkept me from reaching around and unlocking the phone. Yes, I was going\r\nto do it. She'd told me what my path was to freedom -- to the world, to\r\nmy parents -- and that had given me hope. Now she'd threatened to send\r\nme away, to take me off that path, and my hope had crashed and all I\r\ncould think of was how to get back on it.\r\n\r\nSo I rattled my wrists, wanting to get to my phone and unlock it for\r\nher, and she just looked at me coldly, checking her watch.\r\n\r\n\"The password,\" I said, finally understanding what she wanted of me.\r\nShe wanted me to say it out loud, here, where she could record it,\r\nwhere her pals could hear it. She didn't want me to just unlock the\r\nphone. She wanted me to submit to her. To put her in charge of me. To\r\ngive up every secret, all my privacy. \"The password,\" I said again, and\r\nthen I told her the password. God help me, I submitted to her will.\r\n\r\nShe smiled a little prim smile, which had to be her ice-queen\r\nequivalent of a touchdown dance, and the guards led me away. As the\r\ndoor closed, I saw her bend down over the phone and key the password\r\nin.\r\n\r\nI wish I could say that I'd anticipated this possibility in advance and\r\ncreated a fake password that unlocked a completely innocuous partition\r\non my phone, but I wasn't nearly that paranoid/clever.\r\n\r\nYou might be wondering at this point what dark secrets I had locked\r\naway on my phone and memory sticks and email. I'm just a kid, after\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that I had everything to hide, and nothing. Between my\r\nphone and my memory sticks, you could get a pretty good idea of who my\r\nfriends were, what I thought of them, all the goofy things we'd done.\r\nYou could read the transcripts of the electronic arguments we'd carried\r\nout and the electronic reconciliations we'd arrived at.\r\n\r\nYou see, I don't delete stuff. Why would I? Storage is cheap, and you\r\nnever know when you're going to want to go back to that stuff.\r\nEspecially the stupid stuff. You know that feeling you get sometimes\r\nwhere you're sitting on the subway and there's no one to talk to and\r\nyou suddenly remember some bitter fight you had, some terrible thing\r\nyou said? Well, it's usually never as bad as you remember. Being able\r\nto go back and see it again is a great way to remind yourself that\r\nyou're not as horrible a person as you think you are. Darryl and I have\r\ngotten over more fights that way than I can count.\r\n\r\nAnd even that's not it. I know my phone is private. I know my memory\r\nsticks are private. That's because of cryptography -- message\r\nscrambling. The math behind crypto is good and solid, and you and me\r\nget access to the same crypto that banks and the National Security\r\nAgency use. There's only one kind of crypto that anyone uses: crypto\r\nthat's public, open and can be deployed by anyone. That's how you know\r\nit works.\r\n\r\nThere's something really liberating about having some corner of your\r\nlife that's *yours*, that no one gets to see except you. It's a little\r\nlike nudity or taking a dump. Everyone gets naked every once in a\r\nwhile. Everyone has to squat on the toilet. There's nothing shameful,\r\ndeviant or weird about either of them. But what if I decreed that from\r\nnow on, every time you went to evacuate some solid waste, you'd have to\r\ndo it in a glass room perched in the middle of Times Square, and you'd\r\nbe buck naked?\r\n\r\nEven if you've got nothing wrong or weird with your body -- and how\r\nmany of us can say that? -- you'd have to be pretty strange to like\r\nthat idea. Most of us would run screaming. Most of us would hold it in\r\nuntil we exploded.\r\n\r\nIt's not about doing something shameful. It's about doing something\r\n*private*. It's about your life belonging to you.\r\n\r\nThey were taking that from me, piece by piece. As I walked back to my\r\ncell, that feeling of deserving it came back to me. I'd broken a lot of\r\nrules all my life and I'd gotten away with it, by and large. Maybe this\r\nwas justice. Maybe this was my past coming back to me. After all, I had\r\nbeen where I was because I'd snuck out of school.\r\n\r\nI got my shower. I got to walk around the yard. There was a patch of\r\nsky overhead, and it smelled like the Bay Area, but beyond that, I had\r\nno clue where I was being held. No other prisoners were visible during\r\nmy exercise period, and I got pretty bored with walking in circles. I\r\nstrained my ears for any sound that might help me understand what this\r\nplace was, but all I heard was the occasional vehicle, some distant\r\nconversations, a plane landing somewhere nearby.\r\n\r\nThey brought me back to my cell and fed me, a half a pepperoni pie from\r\nGoat Hill Pizza, which I knew well, up on Potrero Hill. The carton with\r\nits familiar graphic and 415 phone number was a reminder that only a\r\nday before, I'd been a free man in a free country and that now I was a\r\nprisoner. I worried constantly about Darryl and fretted about my other\r\nfriends. Maybe they'd been more cooperative and had been released.\r\nMaybe they'd told my parents and they were frantically calling around.\r\n\r\nMaybe not.\r\n\r\nThe cell was fantastically spare, empty as my soul. I fantasized that\r\nthe wall opposite my bunk was a screen, that I could be hacking right\r\nnow, opening the cell-door. I fantasized about my workbench and the\r\nprojects there -- the old cans I was turning into a ghetto\r\nsurround-sound rig, the aerial photography kite-cam I was building, my\r\nhomebrew laptop.\r\n\r\nI wanted to get out of there. I wanted to go home and have my friends\r\nand my school and my parents and my life back. I wanted to be able to\r\ngo where I wanted to go, not be stuck pacing and pacing and pacing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey took my passwords for my USB keys next. Those held some\r\ninteresting messages I'd downloaded from one online discussion group or\r\nanother, some chat transcripts, things where people had helped me out\r\nwith some of the knowledge I needed to do the things I did. There was\r\nnothing on there you couldn't find with Google, of course, but I didn't\r\nthink that would count in my favor.\r\n\r\nI got exercise again that afternoon, and this time there were others in\r\nthe yard when I got there, four other guys and two women, of all ages\r\nand racial backgrounds. I guess lots of people were doing things to\r\nearn their \"privileges.\"\r\n\r\nThey gave me half an hour, and I tried to make conversation with the\r\nmost normal-seeming of the other prisoners, a black guy about my age\r\nwith a short afro. But when I introduced myself and stuck my hand out,\r\nhe cut his eyes toward the cameras mounted ominously in the corners of\r\nthe yard and kept walking without ever changing his facial expression.\r\n\r\nBut then, just before they called my name and brought me back into the\r\nbuilding, the door opened and out came -- Vanessa! I'd never been more\r\nglad to see a friendly face. She looked tired and grumpy, but not hurt,\r\nand when she saw me, she shouted my name and ran to me. We hugged each\r\nother hard and I realized I was shaking. Then I realized she was\r\nshaking, too.\r\n\r\n\"Are you OK?\" she said, holding me at arms' length.\r\n\r\n\"I'm OK,\" I said. \"They told me they'd let me go if I gave them my\r\npasswords.\"\r\n\r\n\"They keep asking me questions about you and Darryl.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a voice blaring over the loudspeaker, shouting at us to stop\r\ntalking, to walk, but we ignored it.\r\n\r\n\"Answer them,\" I said, instantly. \"Anything they ask, answer them. If\r\nit'll get you out.\"\r\n\r\n\"How are Darryl and Jolu?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't seen them.\"\r\n\r\nThe door banged open and four big guards boiled out. Two took me and\r\ntwo took Vanessa. They forced me to the ground and turned my head away\r\nfrom Vanessa, though I heard her getting the same treatment. Plastic\r\ncuffs went around my wrists and then I was yanked to my feet and\r\nbrought back to my cell.\r\n\r\nNo dinner came that night. No breakfast came the next morning. No one\r\ncame and brought me to the interrogation room to extract more of my\r\nsecrets. The plastic cuffs didn't come off, and my shoulders burned,\r\nthen ached, then went numb, then burned again. I lost all feeling in my\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nI had to pee. I couldn't undo my pants. I really, really had to pee.\r\n\r\nI pissed myself.\r\n\r\nThey came for me after that, once the hot piss had cooled and gone\r\nclammy, making my already filthy jeans stick to my legs. They came for\r\nme and walked me down the long hall lined with doors, each door with\r\nits own bar code, each bar code a prisoner like me. They walked me down\r\nthe corridor and brought me to the interrogation room and it was like a\r\ndifferent planet when I entered there, a world where things were\r\nnormal, where everything didn't reek of urine. I felt so dirty and\r\nashamed, and all those feelings of deserving what I got came back to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nSevere haircut lady was already sitting. She was perfect: coifed and\r\nwith just a little makeup. I smelled her hair stuff. She wrinkled her\r\nnose at me. I felt the shame rise in me.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you've been a very naughty boy, haven't you? Aren't you a filthy\r\nthing?\"\r\n\r\nShame. I looked down at the table. I couldn't bear to look up. I wanted\r\nto tell her my email password and get gone.\r\n\r\n\"What did you and your friend talk about in the yard?\"\r\n\r\nI barked a laugh at the table. \"I told her to answer your questions. I\r\ntold her to cooperate.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do you give the orders?\"\r\n\r\nI felt the blood sing in my ears. \"Oh come on,\" I said. \"We play a\r\n*game* together, it's called Harajuku Fun Madness. I'm the *team\r\ncaptain*. We're not terrorists, we're high school students. I don't\r\ngive her orders. I told her that we needed to be *honest* with you so\r\nthat we could clear up any suspicion and get out of here.\"\r\n\r\nShe didn't say anything for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"How is Darryl?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Who?\"\r\n\r\n\"Darryl. You picked us up together. My friend. Someone had stabbed him\r\nin the Powell Street BART. That's why we were up on the surface. To get\r\nhim help.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure he's fine, then,\" she said.\r\n\r\nMy stomach knotted and I almost threw up. \"You don't *know*? You\r\nhaven't got him here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who we have here and who we don't have here is not something we're\r\ngoing to discuss with you, ever. That's not something you're going to\r\nknow. Marcus, you've seen what happens when you don't cooperate with\r\nus. You've seen what happens when you disobey our orders. You've been a\r\nlittle cooperative, and it's gotten you almost to the point where you\r\nmight go free again. If you want to make that possibility into a\r\nreality, you'll stick to answering my questions.\"\r\n\r\nI didn't say anything.\r\n\r\n\"You're learning, that's good. Now, your email passwords, please.\"\r\n\r\nI was ready for this. I gave them everything: server address, login,\r\npassword. This didn't matter. I didn't keep any email on my server. I\r\ndownloaded it all and kept it on my laptop at home, which downloaded\r\nand deleted my mail from the server every sixty seconds. They wouldn't\r\nget anything out of my mail -- it got cleared off the server and stored\r\non my laptop at home.\r\n\r\nBack to the cell, but they cut loose my hands and they gave me a shower\r\nand a pair of orange prison pants to wear. They were too big for me and\r\nhung down low on my hips, like a Mexican gang-kid in the Mission.\r\nThat's where the baggy-pants-down-your-ass look comes from you know\r\nthat? From prison. I tell you what, it's less fun when it's not a\r\nfashion statement.\r\n\r\nThey took away my jeans, and I spent another day in the cell. The walls\r\nwere scratched cement over a steel grid. You could tell, because the\r\nsteel was rusting in the salt air, and the grid shone through the green\r\npaint in red-orange. My parents were out that window, somewhere.\r\n\r\nThey came for me again the next day.\r\n\r\n\"We've been reading your mail for a day now. We changed the password so\r\nthat your home computer couldn't fetch it.\"\r\n\r\nWell, of course they had. I would have done the same, now that I\r\nthought of it.\r\n\r\n\"We have enough on you now to put you away for a very long time,\r\nMarcus. Your possession of these articles --\" she gestured at all my\r\nlittle gizmos -- \"and the data we recovered from your phone and memory\r\nsticks, as well as the subversive material we'd no doubt find if we\r\nraided your house and took your computer. It's enough to put you away\r\nuntil you're an old man. Do you understand that?\"\r\n\r\nI didn't believe it for a second. There's no way a judge would say that\r\nall this stuff constituted any kind of real crime. It was free speech,\r\nit was technological tinkering. It wasn't a crime.\r\n\r\nBut who said that these people would ever put me in front of a judge.\r\n\r\n\"We know where you live, we know who your friends are. We know how you\r\noperate and how you think.\"\r\n\r\nIt dawned on me then. They were about to let me go. The room seemed to\r\nbrighten. I heard myself breathing, short little breaths.\r\n\r\n\"We just want to know one thing: what was the delivery mechanism for\r\nthe bombs on the bridge?\"\r\n\r\nI stopped breathing. The room darkened again.\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"There were ten charges on the bridge, all along its length. They\r\nweren't in car-trunks. They'd been placed there. Who placed them there,\r\nand how did they get there?\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" I said it again.\r\n\r\n\"This is your last chance, Marcus,\" she said. She looked sad. \"You were\r\ndoing so well until now. Tell us this and you can go home. You can get\r\na lawyer and defend yourself in a court of law. There are doubtless\r\nextenuating circumstances that you can use to explain your actions.\r\nJust tell us this thing, and you're gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what you're talking about!\" I was crying and I didn't\r\neven care. Sobbing, blubbering. \"I have *no idea what you're talking\r\nabout*!\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \"Marcus, please. Let us help you. By now you know\r\nthat we always get what we're after.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a gibbering sound in the back of my mind. They were *insane*.\r\nI pulled myself together, working hard to stop the tears. \"Listen,\r\nlady, this is nuts. You've been into my stuff, you've seen it all. I'm\r\na seventeen year old high school student, not a terrorist! You can't\r\nseriously think --\"\r\n\r\n\"Marcus, haven't you figured out that we're serious yet?\" She shook her\r\nhead. \"You get pretty good grades. I thought you'd be smarter than\r\nthat.\" She made a flicking gesture and the guards picked me up by the\r\narmpits.\r\n\r\nBack in my cell, a hundred little speeches occurred to me. The French\r\ncall this \"esprit d'escalier\" -- the spirit of the staircase, the\r\nsnappy rebuttals that come to you after you leave the room and slink\r\ndown the stairs. In my mind, I stood and delivered, telling her that I\r\nwas a citizen who loved my freedom, which made me the patriot and made\r\nher the traitor. In my mind, I shamed her for turning my country into\r\nan armed camp. In my mind, I was eloquent and brilliant and reduced her\r\nto tears.\r\n\r\nBut you know what? None of those fine words came back to me when they\r\npulled me out the next day. All I could think of was freedom. My\r\nparents.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Marcus,\" she said. \"How are you feeling?\"\r\n\r\nI looked down at the table. She had a neat pile of documents in front\r\nof her, and her ubiquitous go-cup of Starbucks beside her. I found it\r\ncomforting somehow, a reminder that there was a real world out there\r\nsomewhere, beyond the walls.\r\n\r\n\"We're through investigating you, for now.\" She let that hang there.\r\nMaybe it meant that she was letting me go. Maybe it meant that she was\r\ngoing to throw me in a pit and forget that I existed.\r\n\r\n\"And?\" I said finally.\r\n\r\n\"And I want you to impress on you again that we are very serious about\r\nthis. Our country has experienced the worst attack ever committed on\r\nits soil. How many 9/11s do you want us to suffer before you're willing\r\nto cooperate? The details of our investigation are secret. We won't\r\nstop at anything in our efforts to bring the perpetrators of these\r\nheinous crimes to justice. Do you understand that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I mumbled.\r\n\r\n\"We are going to send you home today, but you are a marked man. You\r\nhave not been found to be above suspicion -- we're only releasing you\r\nbecause we're done questioning you for now. But from now on, you\r\n*belong* to us. We will be watching you. We'll be waiting for you to\r\nmake a misstep. Do you understand that we can watch you closely, all\r\nthe time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I mumbled.\r\n\r\n\"Good. You will never speak of what happened here to anyone, ever. This\r\nis a matter of national security. Do you know that the death penalty\r\nstill holds for treason in time of war?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I mumbled.\r\n\r\n\"Good boy,\" she purred. \"We have some papers here for you to sign.\" She\r\npushed the stack of papers across the table to me. Little post-its with\r\nSIGN HERE printed on them had been stuck throughout them. A guard undid\r\nmy cuffs.\r\n\r\nI paged through the papers and my eyes watered and my head swam. I\r\ncouldn't make sense of them. I tried to decipher the legalese. It\r\nseemed that I was signing a declaration that I had been voluntarily\r\nheld and submitted to voluntary questioning, of my own free will.\r\n\r\n\"What happens if I don't sign this?\" I said.\r\n\r\nShe snatched the papers back and made that flicking gesture again. The\r\nguards jerked me to my feet.\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" I cried. \"Please! I'll sign them!\" They dragged me to the door.\r\nAll I could see was that door, all I could think of was it closing\r\nbehind me.\r\n\r\nI lost it. I wept. I begged to be allowed to sign the papers. To be so\r\nclose to freedom and have it snatched away, it made me ready to do\r\nanything. I can't count the number of times I've heard someone say,\r\n\"Oh, I'd rather die than do something-or-other\" -- I've said it myself\r\nnow and again. But that was the first time I understood what it really\r\nmeant. I would have rather died than go back to my cell.\r\n\r\nI begged as they took me out into the corridor. I told them I'd sign\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nShe called out to the guards and they stopped. They brought me back.\r\nThey sat me down. One of them put the pen in my hand.\r\n\r\nOf course, I signed, and signed and signed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy jeans and t-shirt were back in my cell, laundered and folded. They\r\nsmelled of detergent. I put them on and washed my face and sat on my\r\ncot and stared at the wall. They'd taken everything from me. First my\r\nprivacy, then my dignity. I'd been ready to sign anything. I would have\r\nsigned a confession that said I'd assassinated Abraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\nI tried to cry, but it was like my eyes were dry, out of tears.\r\n\r\nThey got me again. A guard approached me with a hood, like the hood I'd\r\nbeen put in when they picked us up, whenever that was, days ago, weeks\r\nago.\r\n\r\nThe hood went over my head and cinched tight at my neck. I was in total\r\ndarkness and the air was stifling and stale. I was raised to my feet\r\nand walked down corridors, up stairs, on gravel. Up a gangplank. On a\r\nship's steel deck. My hands were chained behind me, to a railing. I\r\nknelt on the deck and listened to the thrum of the diesel engines.\r\n\r\nThe ship moved. A hint of salt air made its way into the hood. It was\r\ndrizzling and my clothes were heavy with water. I was outside, even if\r\nmy head was in a bag. I was outside, in the world, moments from my\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nThey came for me and led me off the boat and over uneven ground. Up\r\nthree metal stairs. My wrists were unshackled. My hood was removed.\r\n\r\nI was back in the truck. Severe haircut woman was there, at the little\r\ndesk she'd sat at before. She had a ziploc bag with her, and inside it\r\nwere my phone and other little devices, my wallet and the change from\r\nmy pockets. She handed them to me wordlessly.\r\n\r\nI filled my pockets. It felt so weird to have everything back in its\r\nfamiliar place, to be wearing my familiar clothes. Outside the truck's\r\nback door, I heard the familiar sounds of my familiar city.\r\n\r\nA guard passed me my backpack. The woman extended her hand to me. I\r\njust looked at it. She put it down and gave me a wry smile. Then she\r\nmimed zipping up her lips and pointed to me, and opened the door.\r\n\r\nIt was daylight outside, gray and drizzling. I was looking down an\r\nalley toward cars and trucks and bikes zipping down the road. I stood\r\ntransfixed on the truck's top step, staring at freedom.\r\n\r\nMy knees shook. I knew now that they were playing with me again. In a\r\nmoment, the guards would grab me and drag me back inside, the bag would\r\ngo over my head again, and I would be back on the boat and sent off to\r\nthe prison again, to the endless, unanswerable questions. I barely held\r\nmyself back from stuffing my fist in my mouth.\r\n\r\nThen I forced myself to go down one stair. Another stair. The last\r\nstair. My sneakers crunched down on the crap on the alley's floor,\r\nbroken glass, a needle, gravel. I took a step. Another. I reached the\r\nmouth of the alley and stepped onto the sidewalk.\r\n\r\nNo one grabbed me.\r\n\r\nI was free.\r\n\r\nThen strong arms threw themselves around me. I nearly cried.\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nChapter 5\r\n\r\n[[This chapter is dedicated to Secret Headquarters in Los Angeles, my\r\ndrop-dead all-time favorite comic store in the world. It's small and\r\nselective about what it stocks, and every time I walk in, I walk out\r\nwith three or four collections I'd never heard of under my arm. It's\r\nlike the owners, Dave and David, have the uncanny ability to predict\r\nexactly what I'm looking for, and they lay it out for me seconds before\r\nI walk into the store. I discovered about three quarters of my favorite\r\ncomics by wandering into SHQ, grabbing something interesting, sinking\r\ninto one of the comfy chairs, and finding myself transported to another\r\nworld. When my second story-collection, OVERCLOCKED, came out, they\r\nworked with local illustrator Martin Cenreda to do a free mini-comic\r\nbased on Printcrime, the first story in the book. I left LA about a\r\nyear ago, and of all the things I miss about it, Secret Headquarters is\r\nright at the top of the list.]]\r\n\r\n[[Secret Headquarters: http://www.thesecretheadquarters.com/ 3817 W.\r\nSunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 90026 +1 323 666 2228]]\r\n\r\nBut it was Van, and she *was* crying, and hugging me so hard I couldn't\r\nbreathe. I didn't care. I hugged her back, my face buried in her hair.\r\n\r\n\"You're OK!\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I'm OK,\" I managed.\r\n\r\nShe finally let go of me and another set of arms wrapped themselves\r\naround me. It was Jolu! They were both there. He whispered, \"You're\r\nsafe, bro,\" in my ear and hugged me even tighter than Vanessa had.\r\n\r\nWhen he let go, I looked around. \"Where's Darryl?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nThey both looked at each other. \"Maybe he's still in the truck,\" Jolu\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nWe turned and looked at the truck at the alley's end. It was a\r\nnondescript white 18-wheeler. Someone had already brought the little\r\nfolding staircase inside. The rear lights glowed red, and the truck\r\nrolled backwards towards us, emitting a steady eep, eep, eep.\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" I shouted as it accelerated towards us. \"Wait! What about\r\nDarryl?\" The truck drew closer. I kept shouting. \"What about Darryl?\"\r\n\r\nJolu and Vanessa each had me by an arm and were dragging me away. I\r\nstruggled against them, shouting. The truck pulled out of the alley's\r\nmouth and reversed into the street and pointed itself downhill and\r\ndrove away. I tried to run after it, but Van and Jolu wouldn't let me\r\ngo.\r\n\r\nI sat down on the sidewalk and put my arms around my knees and cried. I\r\ncried and cried and cried, loud sobs of the sort I hadn't done since I\r\nwas a little kid. They wouldn't stop coming. I couldn't stop shaking.\r\n\r\nVanessa and Jolu got me to my feet and moved me a little ways up the\r\nstreet. There was a Muni bus stop with a bench and they sat me on it.\r\nThey were both crying too, and we held each other for a while, and I\r\nknew we were crying for Darryl, whom none of us ever expected to see\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were north of Chinatown, at the part where it starts to become North\r\nBeach, a neighborhood with a bunch of neon strip clubs and the\r\nlegendary City Lights counterculture bookstore, where the Beat poetry\r\nmovement had been founded back in the 1950s.\r\n\r\nI knew this part of town well. My parents' favorite Italian restaurant\r\nwas here and they liked to take me here for big plates of linguine and\r\nhuge Italian ice-cream mountains with candied figs and lethal little\r\nespressos afterward.\r\n\r\nNow it was a different place, a place where I was tasting freedom for\r\nthe first time in what seemed like an eternity.\r\n\r\nWe checked our pockets and found enough money to get a table at one of\r\nthe Italian restaurants, out on the sidewalk, under an awning. The\r\npretty waitress lighted a gas-heater with a barbeque lighter, took our\r\norders and went inside. The sensation of giving orders, of controlling\r\nmy destiny, was the most amazing thing I'd ever felt.\r\n\r\n\"How long were we in there?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Six days,\" Vanessa said.\r\n\r\n\"I got five,\" Jolu said.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't count.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did they do to you?\" Vanessa said. I didn't want to talk about\r\nit, but they were both looking at me. Once I started, I couldn't stop.\r\nI told them everything, even when I'd been forced to piss myself, and\r\nthey took it all in silently. I paused when the waitress delivered our\r\nsodas and waited until she got out of earshot, then finished. In the\r\ntelling, it receded into the distance. By the end of it, I couldn't\r\ntell if I was embroidering the truth or if I was making it all seem\r\n*less* bad. My memories swam like little fish that I snatched at, and\r\nsometimes they wriggled out of my grasp.\r\n\r\nJolu shook his head. \"They were hard on you, dude,\" he said. He told us\r\nabout his stay there. They'd questioned him, mostly about me, and he'd\r\nkept on telling them the truth, sticking to a plain telling of the\r\nfacts about that day and about our friendship. They had gotten him to\r\nrepeat it over and over again, but they hadn't played games with his\r\nhead the way they had with me. He'd eaten his meals in a mess-hall with\r\na bunch of other people, and been given time in a TV room where they\r\nwere shown last year's blockbusters on video.\r\n\r\nVanessa's story was only slightly different. After she'd gotten them\r\nangry by talking to me, they'd taken away her clothes and made her wear\r\na set of orange prison overalls. She'd been left in her cell for two\r\ndays without contact, though she'd been fed regularly. But mostly it\r\nwas the same as Jolu: the same questions, repeated again and again.\r\n\r\n\"They really hated you,\" Jolu said. \"Really had it in for you. Why?\"\r\n\r\nI couldn't imagine why. Then I remembered.\r\n\r\n*You can cooperate, or you can be very, very sorry.*\r\n\r\n\"It was because I wouldn't unlock my phone for them, that first night.\r\nThat's why they singled me out.\" I couldn't believe it, but there was\r\nno other explanation. It had been sheer vindictiveness. My mind reeled\r\nat the thought. They had done all that as a mere punishment for defying\r\ntheir authority.\r\n\r\nI had been scared. Now I was angry. \"Those bastards,\" I said, softly.\r\n\"They did it to get back at me for mouthing off.\"\r\n\r\nJolu swore and then Vanessa cut loose in Korean, something she only did\r\nwhen she was really, really angry.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to get them,\" I whispered, staring at my soda. \"I'm going to\r\nget them.\"\r\n\r\nJolu shook his head. \"You can't, you know. You can't fight back against\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNone of us much wanted to talk about revenge then. Instead, we talked\r\nabout what we would do next. We had to go home. Our phones' batteries\r\nwere dead and it had been years since this neighborhood had any\r\npayphones. We just needed to go home. I even thought about taking a\r\ntaxi, but there wasn't enough money between us to make that possible.\r\n\r\nSo we walked. On the corner, we pumped some quarters into a San\r\nFrancisco Chronicle newspaper box and stopped to read the front\r\nsection. It had been five days since the bombs went off, but it was\r\nstill all over the front cover.\r\n\r\nSevere haircut woman had talked about \"the bridge\" blowing up, and I'd\r\njust assumed that she was talking about the Golden Gate bridge, but I\r\nwas wrong. The terrorists had blown up the *Bay bridge*.\r\n\r\n\"Why the hell would they blow up the Bay Bridge?\" I said. \"The Golden\r\nGate is the one on all the postcards.\" Even if you've never been to San\r\nFrancisco, chances are you know what the Golden Gate looks like: it's\r\nthat big orange suspension bridge that swoops dramatically from the old\r\nmilitary base called the Presidio to Sausalito, where all the cutesy\r\nwine-country towns are with their scented candle shops and art\r\ngalleries. It's picturesque as hell, and it's practically the symbol\r\nfor the state of California. If you go to the Disneyland California\r\nAdventure park, there's a replica of it just past the gates, with a\r\nmonorail running over it.\r\n\r\nSo naturally I assumed that if you were going to blow up a bridge in\r\nSan Francisco, that's the one you'd blow.\r\n\r\n\"They probably got scared off by all the cameras and stuff,\" Jolu said.\r\n\"The National Guard's always checking cars at both ends and there's all\r\nthose suicide fences and junk all along it.\" People have been jumping\r\noff the Golden Gate since it opened in 1937 -- they stopped counting\r\nafter the thousandth suicide in 1995.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" Vanessa said. \"Plus the Bay Bridge actually goes somewhere.\"\r\nThe Bay Bridge goes from downtown San Francisco to Oakland and thence\r\nto Berkeley, the East Bay townships that are home to many of the people\r\nwho live and work in town. It's one of the only parts of the Bay Area\r\nwhere a normal person can afford a house big enough to really stretch\r\nout in, and there's also the university and a bunch of light industry\r\nover there. The BART goes under the Bay and connects the two cities,\r\ntoo, but it's the Bay Bridge that sees most of the traffic. The Golden\r\nGate was a nice bridge if you were a tourist or a rich retiree living\r\nout in wine country, but it was mostly ornamental. The Bay Bridge is --\r\nwas -- San Francisco's work-horse bridge.\r\n\r\nI thought about it for a minute. \"You guys are right,\" I said. \"But I\r\ndon't think that's all of it. We keep acting like terrorists attack\r\nlandmarks because they hate landmarks. Terrorists don't hate landmarks\r\nor bridges or airplanes. They just want to screw stuff up and make\r\npeople scared. To make terror. So of course they went after the Bay\r\nBridge after the Golden Gate got all those cameras -- after airplanes\r\ngot all metal-detectored and X-rayed.\" I thought about it some more,\r\nstaring blankly at the cars rolling down the street, at the people\r\nwalking down the sidewalks, at the city all around me. \"Terrorists\r\ndon't hate airplanes or bridges. They love terror.\" It was so obvious I\r\ncouldn't believe I'd never thought of it before. I guess that being\r\ntreated like a terrorist for a few days was enough to clarify my\r\nthinking.\r\n\r\nThe other two were staring at me. \"I'm right, aren't I? All this crap,\r\nall the X-rays and ID checks, they're all useless, aren't they?\"\r\n\r\nThey nodded slowly.\r\n\r\n\"Worse than useless,\" I said, my voice going up and cracking. \"Because\r\nthey ended up with us in prison, with Darryl --\" I hadn't thought of\r\nDarryl since we sat down and now it came back to me, my friend,\r\nmissing, disappeared. I stopped talking and ground my jaws together.\r\n\r\n\"We have to tell our parents,\" Jolu said.\r\n\r\n\"We should get a lawyer,\" Vanessa said.\r\n\r\nI thought of telling my story. Of telling the world what had become of\r\nme. Of the videos that would no doubt come out, of me weeping, reduced\r\nto a groveling animal.\r\n\r\n\"We can't tell them anything,\" I said, without thinking.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Van said.\r\n\r\n\"We can't tell them anything,\" I repeated. \"You heard her. If we talk,\r\nthey'll come back for us. They'll do to us what they did to Darryl.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're joking,\" Jolu said. \"You want us to --\"\r\n\r\n\"I want us to fight back,\" I said. \"I want to stay free so that I can\r\ndo that. If we go out there and blab, they'll just say that we're kids,\r\nmaking it up. We don't even know where we were held! No one will\r\nbelieve us. Then, one day, they'll come for us.\r\n\r\n\"I'm telling my parents that I was in one of those camps on the other\r\nside of the Bay. I came over to meet you guys there and we got\r\nstranded, and just got loose today. They said in the papers that people\r\nwere still wandering home from them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't do that,\" Vanessa said. \"After what they did to you, how can\r\nyou even think of doing that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It happened to *me*, that's the point. This is me and them, now. I'll\r\nbeat them, I'll get Darryl. I'm not going to take this lying down. But\r\nonce our parents are involved, that's it for us. No one will believe us\r\nand no one will care. If we do it my way, people will care.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's your way?\" Jolu said. \"What's your plan?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know yet,\" I admitted. \"Give me until tomorrow morning, give\r\nme that, at least.\" I knew that once they'd kept it a secret for a day,\r\nit would have to be a secret forever. Our parents would be even more\r\nskeptical if we suddenly \"remembered\" that we'd been held in a secret\r\nprison instead of taken care of in a refugee camp.\r\n\r\nVan and Jolu looked at each other.\r\n\r\n\"I'm just asking for a chance,\" I said. \"We'll work out the story on\r\nthe way, get it straight. Give me one day, just one day.\"\r\n\r\nThe other two nodded glumly and we set off downhill again, heading back\r\ntowards home. I lived on Potrero Hill, Vanessa lived in the North\r\nMission and Jolu lived in Noe Valley -- three wildly different\r\nneighborhoods just a few minutes' walk from one another.\r\n\r\nWe turned onto Market Street and stopped dead. The street was\r\nbarricaded at every corner, the cross-streets reduced to a single lane,\r\nand parked down the whole length of Market Street were big, nondescript\r\n18-wheelers like the one that had carried us, hooded, away from the\r\nship's docks and to Chinatown.\r\n\r\nEach one had three steel steps leading down from the back and they\r\nbuzzed with activity as soldiers, people in suits, and cops went in and\r\nout of them. The suits wore little badges on their lapels and the\r\nsoldiers scanned them as they went in and out -- wireless authorization\r\nbadges. As we walked past one, I got a look at it, and saw the familiar\r\nlogo: Department of Homeland Security. The soldier saw me staring and\r\nstared back hard, glaring at me.\r\n\r\nI got the message and moved on. I peeled away from the gang at Van\r\nNess. We clung to each other and cried and promised to call each other.\r\n\r\nThe walk back to Potrero Hill has an easy route and a hard route, the\r\nlatter taking you over some of the steepest hills in the city, the kind\r\nof thing that you see car chases on in action movies, with cars\r\ncatching air as they soar over the zenith. I always take the hard way\r\nhome. It's all residential streets, and the old Victorian houses they\r\ncall \"painted ladies\" for their gaudy, elaborate paint-jobs, and front\r\ngardens with scented flowers and tall grasses. Housecats stare at you\r\nfrom hedges, and there are hardly any homeless.\r\n\r\nIt was so quiet on those streets that it made me wish I'd taken the\r\n*other* route, through the Mission, which is... *raucous* is probably\r\nthe best word for it. Loud and vibrant. Lots of rowdy drunks and angry\r\ncrack-heads and unconscious junkies, and also lots of families with\r\nstrollers, old ladies gossiping on stoops, lowriders with boom-cars\r\ngoing thumpa-thumpa-thumpa down the streets. There were hipsters and\r\nmopey emo art-students and even a couple old-school punk-rockers, old\r\nguys with pot bellies bulging out beneath their Dead Kennedys shirts.\r\nAlso drag queens, angry gang kids, graffiti artists and bewildered\r\ngentrifiers trying not to get killed while their real-estate\r\ninvestments matured.\r\n\r\nI went up Goat Hill and walked past Goat Hill Pizza, which made me\r\nthink of the jail I'd been held in, and I had to sit down on the bench\r\nout front of the restaurant until my shakes passed. Then I noticed the\r\ntruck up the hill from me, a nondescript 18-wheeler with three metal\r\nsteps coming down from the back end. I got up and got moving. I felt\r\nthe eyes watching me from all directions.\r\n\r\nI hurried the rest of the way home. I didn't look at the painted ladies\r\nor the gardens or the housecats. I kept my eyes down.\r\n\r\nBoth my parents' cars were in the driveway, even though it was the\r\nmiddle of the day. Of course. Dad works in the East Bay, so he'd be\r\nstuck at home while they worked on the bridge. Mom -- well, who knew\r\nwhy Mom was home.\r\n\r\nThey were home for me.\r\n\r\nEven before I'd finished unlocking the door it had been jerked out of\r\nmy hand and flung wide. There were both of my parents, looking gray and\r\nhaggard, bug-eyed and staring at me. We stood there in frozen tableau\r\nfor a moment, then they both rushed forward and dragged me into the\r\nhouse, nearly tripping me up. They were both talking so loud and fast\r\nall I could hear was a wordless, roaring gabble and they both hugged me\r\nand cried and I cried too and we just stood there like that in the\r\nlittle foyer, crying and making almost-words until we ran out of steam\r\nand went into the kitchen.\r\n\r\nI did what I always did when I came home: got myself a glass of water\r\nfrom the filter in the fridge and dug a couple cookies out of the\r\n\"biscuit barrel\" that mom's sister had sent us from England. The\r\nnormalcy of this made my heart stop hammering, my heart catching up\r\nwith my brain, and soon we were all sitting at the table.\r\n\r\n\"Where have you been?\" they both said, more or less in unison.\r\n\r\nI had given this some thought on the way home. \"I got trapped,\" I said.\r\n\"In Oakland. I was there with some friends, doing a project, and we\r\nwere all quarantined.\"\r\n\r\n\"For five days?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" I said. \"Yeah. It was really bad.\" I'd read about the\r\nquarantines in the Chronicle and I cribbed shamelessly from the quotes\r\nthey'd published. \"Yeah. Everyone who got caught in the cloud. They\r\nthought we had been attacked with some kind of super-bug and they\r\npacked us into shipping containers in the docklands, like sardines. It\r\nwas really hot and sticky. Not much food, either.\"\r\n\r\n\"Christ,\" Dad said, his fists balling up on the table. Dad teaches in\r\nBerkeley three days a week, working with a few grad students in the\r\nlibrary science program. The rest of the time he consults for clients\r\nin city and down the Peninsula, third-wave dotcoms that are doing\r\nvarious things with archives. He's a mild-mannered librarian by\r\nprofession, but he'd been a real radical in the sixties and wrestled a\r\nlittle in high school. I'd seen him get crazy angry now and again --\r\nI'd even made him that angry now and again -- and he could seriously\r\nlose it when he was Hulking out. He once threw a swing-set from Ikea\r\nacross my granddad's whole lawn when it fell apart for the fiftieth\r\ntime while he was assembling it.\r\n\r\n\"Barbarians,\" Mom said. She's been living in America since she was a\r\nteenager, but she still comes over all British when she encounters\r\nAmerican cops, health-care, airport security or homelessness. Then the\r\nword is \"barbarians,\" and her accent comes back strong. We'd been to\r\nLondon twice to see her family and I can't say as it felt any more\r\ncivilized than San Francisco, just more cramped.\r\n\r\n\"But they let us go, and ferried us over today.\" I was improvising now.\r\n\r\n\"Are you hurt?\" Mom said. \"Hungry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sleepy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, a little of all that. Also Dopey, Doc, Sneezy and Bashful.\" We\r\nhad a family tradition of Seven Dwarfs jokes. They both smiled a\r\nlittle, but their eyes were still wet. I felt really bad for them. They\r\nmust have been out of their minds with worry. I was glad for a chance\r\nto change the subject. \"I'd totally love to eat.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll order a pizza from Goat Hill,\" Dad said.\r\n\r\n\"No, not that,\" I said. They both looked at me like I'd sprouted\r\nantennae. I normally have a thing about Goat Hill Pizza -- as in, I can\r\nnormally eat it like a goldfish eats his food, gobbling until it either\r\nruns out or I pop. I tried to smile. \"I just don't feel like pizza,\" I\r\nsaid, lamely. \"Let's order some curry, OK?\" Thank heaven that San\r\nFrancisco is take-out central.\r\n\r\nMom went to the drawer of take-out menus (more normalcy, feeling like a\r\ndrink of water on a dry, sore throat) and riffled through them. We\r\nspent a couple of distracting minutes going through the menu from the\r\nhalal Pakistani place on Valencia. I settled on a mixed tandoori grill\r\nand creamed spinach with farmer's cheese, a salted mango lassi (much\r\nbetter than it sounds) and little fried pastries in sugar syrup.\r\n\r\nOnce the food was ordered, the questions started again. They'd heard\r\nfrom Van's, Jolu's and Darryl's families (of course) and had tried to\r\nreport us missing. The police were taking names, but there were so many\r\n\"displaced persons\" that they weren't going to open files on anyone\r\nunless they were still missing after seven days.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, millions of have-you-seen sites had popped up on the net. A\r\ncouple of the sites were old MySpace clones that had run out of money\r\nand saw a new lease on life from all the attention. After all, some\r\nventure capitalists had missing family in the Bay Area. Maybe if they\r\nwere recovered, the site would attract some new investment. I grabbed\r\ndad's laptop and looked through them. They were plastered with\r\nadvertising, of course, and pictures of missing people, mostly grad\r\nphotos, wedding pictures and that sort of thing. It was pretty\r\nghoulish.\r\n\r\nI found my pic and saw that it was linked to Van's, Jolu's, and\r\nDarryl's. There was a little form for marking people found and another\r\none for writing up notes about other missing people. I filled in the\r\nfields for me and Jolu and Van, and left Darryl blank.\r\n\r\n\"You forgot Darryl,\" Dad said. He didn't like Darryl much -- once he'd\r\nfigured out that a couple inches were missing out of one of the bottles\r\nin his liquor cabinet, and to my enduring shame I'd blamed it on\r\nDarryl. In truth, of course, it had been both of us, just fooling\r\naround, trying out vodka-and-Cokes during an all-night gaming session.\r\n\r\n\"He wasn't with us,\" I said. The lie tasted bitter in my mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Oh my God,\" my mom said. She squeezed her hands together. \"We just\r\nassumed when you came home that you'd all been together.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said, the lie growing. \"No, he was supposed to meet us but we\r\nnever met up. He's probably just stuck over in Berkeley. He was going\r\nto take the BART over.\"\r\n\r\nMom made a whimpering sound. Dad shook his head and closed his eyes.\r\n\"Don't you know about the BART?\" he said.\r\n\r\nI shook my head. I could see where this was going. I felt like the\r\nground was rushing up to me.\r\n\r\n\"They blew it up,\" Dad said. \"The bastards blew it up at the same time\r\nas the bridge.\"\r\n\r\nThat hadn't been on the front page of the Chronicle, but then, a BART\r\nblowout under the water wouldn't be nearly as picturesque as the images\r\nof the bridge hanging in tatters and pieces over the Bay. The BART\r\ntunnel from the Embarcadero in San Francisco to the West Oakland\r\nstation was submerged.\r\n\r\nI went back to Dad's computer and surfed the headlines. No one was\r\nsure, but the body count was in the thousands. Between the cars that\r\nplummeted 191 feet to the sea and the people drowned in the trains, the\r\ndeaths were mounting. One reporter claimed to have interviewed an\r\n\"identity counterfeiter\" who'd helped \"dozens\" of people walk away from\r\ntheir old lives by simply vanishing after the attacks, getting new ID\r\nmade up, and slipping away from bad marriages, bad debts and bad lives.\r\n\r\nDad actually got tears in his eyes, and Mom was openly crying. They\r\neach hugged me again, patting me with their hands as if to assure\r\nthemselves that I was really there. They kept telling me they loved me.\r\nI told them I loved them too.\r\n\r\nWe had a weepy dinner and Mom and Dad had each had a couple glasses of\r\nwine, which was a lot for them. I told them that I was getting sleepy,\r\nwhich was true, and mooched up to my room. I wasn't going to bed,\r\nthough. I needed to get online and find out what was going on. I needed\r\nto talk to Jolu and Vanessa. I needed to get working on finding Darryl.\r\n\r\nI crept up to my room and opened the door. I hadn't seen my old bed in\r\nwhat felt like a thousand years. I lay down on it and reached over to\r\nmy bedstand to grab my laptop. I must have not plugged it in all the\r\nway -- the electrical adapter needed to be jiggled just right -- so it\r\nhad slowly discharged while I was away. I plugged it back in and gave\r\nit a minute or two to charge up before trying to power it up again. I\r\nused the time to get undressed and throw my clothes in the trash -- I\r\nnever wanted to see them again -- and put on a clean pair of boxers and\r\na fresh t-shirt. The fresh-laundered clothes, straight out of my\r\ndrawers, felt so familiar and comfortable, like getting hugged by my\r\nparents.\r\n\r\nI powered up my laptop and punched a bunch of pillows into place behind\r\nme at the top of the bed. I scooched back and opened my computer's lid\r\nand settled it onto my thighs. It was still booting, and man, those\r\nicons creeping across the screen looked *good*. It came all the way up\r\nand then it started giving me more low-power warnings. I checked the\r\npower-cable again and wiggled it and they went away. The power-jack was\r\nreally flaking out.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it was so bad that I couldn't actually get anything done.\r\nEvery time I took my hand off the power-cable it lost contact and the\r\ncomputer started to complain about its battery. I took a closer look at\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe whole case of my computer was slightly misaligned, the seam split\r\nin an angular gape that started narrow and widened toward the back.\r\n\r\nSometimes you look at a piece of equipment and discover something like\r\nthis and you wonder, \"Was it always like that?\" Maybe you just never\r\nnoticed.\r\n\r\nBut with my laptop, that wasn't possible. You see, I built it. After\r\nthe Board of Ed issued us all with SchoolBooks, there was no way my\r\nparents were going to buy me a computer of my own, even though\r\ntechnically the SchoolBook didn't belong to me, and I wasn't supposed\r\nto install software on it or mod it.\r\n\r\nI had some money saved -- odd jobs, Christmases and birthdays, a little\r\nbit of judicious ebaying. Put it all together and I had enough money to\r\nbuy a totally crappy, five-year-old machine.\r\n\r\nSo Darryl and I built one instead. You can buy laptop cases just like\r\nyou can buy cases for desktop PCs, though they're a little more\r\nspecialized than plain old PCs. I'd built a couple PCs with Darryl over\r\nthe years, scavenging parts from Craigslist and garage sales and\r\nordering stuff from cheap cheap Taiwanese vendors we found on the net.\r\nI figured that building a laptop would be the best way to get the power\r\nI wanted at the price I could afford.\r\n\r\nTo build your own laptop, you start by ordering a \"barebook\" -- a\r\nmachine with just a little hardware in it and all the right slots. The\r\ngood news was, once I was done, I had a machine that was a whole pound\r\nlighter than the Dell I'd had my eye on, ran faster, and cost a third\r\nof what I would have paid Dell. The bad news was that assembling a\r\nlaptop is like building one of those ships in a bottle. It's all\r\nfinicky work with tweezers and magnifying glasses, trying to get\r\neverything to fit in that little case. Unlike a full-sized PC -- which\r\nis mostly air -- every cubic millimeter of space in a laptop is spoken\r\nfor. Every time I thought I had it, I'd go to screw the thing back\r\ntogether and find that something was keeping the case from closing all\r\nthe way, and it'd be back to the drawing board.\r\n\r\nSo I knew *exactly* how the seam on my laptop was supposed to look when\r\nthe thing was closed, and it was *not* supposed to look like this.\r\n\r\nI kept jiggling the power-adapter, but it was hopeless. There was no\r\nway I was going to get the thing to boot without taking it apart. I\r\ngroaned and put it beside the bed. I'd deal with it in the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was the theory, anyway. Two hours later, I was still staring at\r\nthe ceiling, playing back movies in my head of what they'd done to me,\r\nwhat I should have done, all regrets and *esprit d'escalier.*\r\n\r\nI rolled out of bed. It had gone midnight and I'd heard my parents hit\r\nthe sack at eleven. I grabbed the laptop and cleared some space on my\r\ndesk and clipped the little LED lamps to the temples of my magnifying\r\nglasses and pulled out a set of little precision screwdrivers. A minute\r\nlater, I had the case open and the keyboard removed and I was staring\r\nat the guts of my laptop. I got a can of compressed air and blew out\r\nthe dust that the fan had sucked in and looked things over.\r\n\r\nSomething wasn't right. I couldn't put my finger on it, but then it had\r\nbeen months since I'd had the lid off this thing. Luckily, the third\r\ntime I'd had to open it up and struggle to close it again, I'd gotten\r\nsmart: I'd taken a photo of the guts with everything in place. I hadn't\r\nbeen totally smart: at first, I'd just left that pic on my hard drive,\r\nand naturally I couldn't get to it when I had the laptop in parts. But\r\nthen I'd printed it out and stuck it in my messy drawer of papers, the\r\ndead-tree graveyard where I kept all the warranty cards and pin-out\r\ndiagrams. I shuffled them -- they seemed messier than I remembered --\r\nand brought out my photo. I set it down next to the computer and kind\r\nof unfocused my eyes, trying to find things that looked out of place.\r\n\r\nThen I spotted it. The ribbon cable that connected the keyboard to the\r\nlogic-board wasn't connected right. That was a weird one. There was no\r\ntorque on that part, nothing to dislodge it in the course of normal\r\noperations. I tried to press it back down again and discovered that the\r\nplug wasn't just badly mounted -- there was something between it and\r\nthe board. I tweezed it out and shone my light on it.\r\n\r\nThere was something new in my keyboard. It was a little chunk of\r\nhardware, only a sixteenth of an inch thick, with no markings. The\r\nkeyboard was plugged into it, and it was plugged into the board. It\r\nother words, it was perfectly situated to capture all the keystrokes I\r\nmade while I typed on my machine.\r\n\r\nIt was a bug.\r\n\r\nMy heart thudded in my ears. It was dark and quiet in the house, but it\r\nwasn't a comforting dark. There were eyes out there, eyes and ears, and\r\nthey were watching me. Surveilling me. The surveillance I faced at\r\nschool had followed me home, but this time, it wasn't just the Board of\r\nEducation looking over my shoulder: the Department of Homeland Security\r\nhad joined them.\r\n\r\nI almost took the bug out. Then I figured that who ever put it there\r\nwould know that it was gone. I left it in. It made me sick to do it.\r\n\r\nI looked around for more tampering. I couldn't find any, but did that\r\nmean there hadn't been any? Someone had broken into my room and planted\r\nthis device -- had disassembled my laptop and reassembled it. There\r\nwere lots of other ways to wiretap a computer. I could never find them\r\nall.\r\n\r\nI put the machine together with numb fingers. This time, the case\r\nwouldn't snap shut just right, but the power-cable stayed in. I booted\r\nit up and set my fingers on the keyboard, thinking that I would run\r\nsome diagnostics and see what was what.\r\n\r\nBut I couldn't do it.\r\n\r\nHell, maybe my room was wiretapped. Maybe there was a camera spying on\r\nme now.\r\n\r\nI'd been feeling paranoid when I got home. Now I was nearly out of my\r\nskin. It felt like I was back in jail, back in the interrogation room,\r\nstalked by entities who had me utterly in their power. It made me want\r\nto cry.\r\n\r\nOnly one thing for it.\r\n\r\nI went into the bathroom and took off the toilet-paper roll and\r\nreplaced it with a fresh one. Luckily, it was almost empty already. I\r\nunrolled the rest of the paper and dug through my parts box until I\r\nfound a little plastic envelope full of ultra-bright white LEDs I'd\r\nscavenged out of a dead bike-lamp. I punched their leads through the\r\ncardboard tube carefully, using a pin to make the holes, then got out\r\nsome wire and connected them all in series with little metal clips. I\r\ntwisted the wires into the leads for a nine-volt battery and connected\r\nthe battery. Now I had a tube ringed with ultra-bright, directional\r\nLEDs, and I could hold it up to my eye and look through it.\r\n\r\nI'd built one of these last year as a science fair project and had been\r\nthrown out of the fair once I showed that there were hidden cameras in\r\nhalf the classrooms at Chavez High. Pinhead video-cameras cost less\r\nthan a good restaurant dinner these days, so they're showing up\r\neverywhere. Sneaky store clerks put them in changing rooms or tanning\r\nsalons and get pervy with the hidden footage they get from their\r\ncustomers -- sometimes they just put it on the net. Knowing how to turn\r\na toilet-paper roll and three bucks' worth of parts into a\r\ncamera-detector is just good sense.\r\n\r\nThis is the simplest way to catch a spy-cam. They have tiny lenses, but\r\nthey reflect light like the dickens. It works best in a dim room: stare\r\nthrough the tube and slowly scan all the walls and other places someone\r\nmight have put a camera until you see the glint of a reflection. If the\r\nreflection stays still as you move around, that's a lens.\r\n\r\nThere wasn't a camera in my room -- not one I could detect, anyway.\r\nThere might have been audio bugs, of course. Or better cameras. Or\r\nnothing at all. Can you blame me for feeling paranoid?\r\n\r\nI loved that laptop. I called it the Salmagundi, which means anything\r\nmade out of spare parts.\r\n\r\nOnce you get to naming your laptop, you know that you're really having\r\na deep relationship with it. Now, though, I felt like I didn't want to\r\never touch it again. I wanted to throw it out the window. Who knew what\r\nthey'd done to it? Who knew how it had been tapped?\r\n\r\nI put it in a drawer with the lid shut and looked at the ceiling. It\r\nwas late and I should be in bed. There was no way I was going to sleep\r\nnow, though. I was tapped. Everyone might be tapped. The world had\r\nchanged forever.\r\n\r\n\"I'll find a way to get them,\" I said. It was a vow, I knew it when I\r\nheard it, though I'd never made a vow before.\r\n\r\nI couldn't sleep after that. And besides, I had an idea.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in my closet was a shrink-wrapped box containing one\r\nstill-sealed, mint-in-package Xbox Universal. Every Xbox has been sold\r\nway below cost -- Microsoft makes most of its money charging games\r\ncompanies money for the right to put out Xbox games -- but the\r\nUniversal was the first Xbox that Microsoft decided to give away\r\nentirely for free.\r\n\r\nLast Christmas season, there'd been poor losers on every corner dressed\r\nas warriors from the Halo series, handing out bags of these\r\ngame-machines as fast as they could. I guess it worked -- everyone says\r\nthey sold a whole butt-load of games. Naturally, there were\r\ncountermeasures to make sure you only played games from companies that\r\nhad bought licenses from Microsoft to make them.\r\n\r\nHackers blow through those countermeasures. The Xbox was cracked by a\r\nkid from MIT who wrote a best-selling book about it, and then the 360\r\nwent down, and then the short-lived Xbox Portable (which we all called\r\nthe \"luggable\" -- it weighed three pounds!) succumbed. The Universal\r\nwas supposed to be totally bulletproof. The high school kids who broke\r\nit were Brazilian Linux hackers who lived in a *favela* -- a kind of\r\nsquatter's slum.\r\n\r\nNever underestimate the determination of a kid who is time-rich and\r\ncash-poor.\r\n\r\nOnce the Brazilians published their crack, we all went nuts on it. Soon\r\nthere were dozens of alternate operating systems for the Xbox\r\nUniversal. My favorite was ParanoidXbox, a flavor of Paranoid Linux.\r\nParanoid Linux is an operating system that assumes that its operator is\r\nunder assault from the government (it was intended for use by Chinese\r\nand Syrian dissidents), and it does everything it can to keep your\r\ncommunications and documents a secret. It even throws up a bunch of\r\n\"chaff\" communications that are supposed to disguise the fact that\r\nyou're doing anything covert. So while you're receiving a political\r\nmessage one character at a time, ParanoidLinux is pretending to surf\r\nthe Web and fill in questionnaires and flirt in chat-rooms. Meanwhile,\r\none in every five hundred characters you receive is your real message,\r\na needle buried in a huge haystack.\r\n\r\nI'd burned a ParanoidXbox DVD when they first appeared, but I'd never\r\ngotten around to unpacking the Xbox in my closet, finding a TV to hook\r\nit up to and so on. My room is crowded enough as it is without letting\r\nMicrosoft crashware eat up valuable workspace.\r\n\r\nTonight, I'd make the sacrifice. It took about twenty minutes to get up\r\nand running. Not having a TV was the hardest part, but eventually I\r\nremembered that I had a little overhead LCD projector that had standard\r\nTV RCA connectors on the back. I connected it to the Xbox and shone it\r\non the back of my door and got ParanoidLinux installed.\r\n\r\nNow I was up and running, and ParanoidLinux was looking for other Xbox\r\nUniversals to talk to. Every Xbox Universal comes with built-in\r\nwireless for multiplayer gaming. You can connect to your neighbors on\r\nthe wireless link and to the Internet, if you have a wireless Internet\r\nconnection. I found three different sets of neighbors in range. Two of\r\nthem had their Xbox Universals also connected to the Internet.\r\nParanoidXbox loved that configuration: it could siphon off some of my\r\nneighbors' Internet connections and use them to get online through the\r\ngaming network. The neighbors would never miss the packets: they were\r\npaying for flat-rate Internet connections, and they weren't exactly\r\ndoing a lot of surfing at 2AM.\r\n\r\nThe best part of all this is how it made me *feel*: in control. My\r\ntechnology was working for me, serving me, protecting me. It wasn't\r\nspying on me. This is why I loved technology: if you used it right, it\r\ncould give you power and privacy.\r\n\r\nMy brain was really going now, running like 60. There were lots of\r\nreasons to run ParanoidXbox -- the best one was that anyone could write\r\ngames for it. Already there was a port of MAME, the Multiple Arcade\r\nMachine Emulator, so you could play practically any game that had ever\r\nbeen written, all the way back to Pong -- games for the Apple ][+ and\r\ngames for the Colecovision, games for the NES and the Dreamcast, and so\r\non.\r\n\r\nEven better were all the cool multiplayer games being built\r\nspecifically for ParanoidXbox -- totally free hobbyist games that\r\nanyone could run. When you combined it all, you had a free console full\r\nof free games that could get you free Internet access.\r\n\r\nAnd the best part -- as far as I was concerned -- was that ParanoidXbox\r\nwas *paranoid*. Every bit that went over the air was scrambled to\r\nwithin an inch of its life. You could wiretap it all you wanted, but\r\nyou'd never figure out who was talking, what they were talking about,\r\nor who they were talking to. Anonymous web, email and IM. Just what I\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nAll I had to do now was convince everyone I knew to use it too.\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nChapter 6\r\n\r\n[[This chapter is dedicated to Powell's Books, the legendary \"City of\r\nBooks\" in Portland, Oregon. Powell's is the largest bookstore in the\r\nworld, an endless, multi-storey universe of papery smells and towering\r\nshelves.

The clerks are friendly, the\r\nstock is fabulous, and there's even a Powell's at the Portland airport,\r\nmaking it just about the best airport bookstore in the world for my\r\nmoney!]]\r\n\r\n[[Powell's Books:\r\nhttp://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?isbn=9780765319852 1005 W\r\nBurnside, Portland, OR 97209 USA +1 800 878 7323]]\r\n\r\nBelieve it or not, my parents made me go to school the next day. I'd\r\nonly fallen into feverish sleep at three in the morning, but at seven\r\nthe next day, my Dad was standing at the foot of my bed, threatening to\r\ndrag me out by the ankles. I managed to get up -- something had died in\r\nmy mouth after painting my eyelids shut -- and into the shower.\r\n\r\nI let my mom force a piece of toast and a banana into me, wishing\r\nfervently that my parents would let me drink coffee at home. I could\r\nsneak one on the way to school, but watching them sip down their black\r\ngold while I was drag-assing around the house, getting dressed and\r\nputting my books in my bag -- it was awful.\r\n\r\nI've walked to school a thousand times, but today it was different. I\r\nwent up and over the hills to get down into the Mission, and everywhere\r\nthere were trucks. I saw new sensors and traffic cameras installed at\r\nmany of the stop-signs. Someone had a lot of surveillance gear lying\r\naround, waiting to be installed at the first opportunity. The attack on\r\nthe Bay Bridge had been just what they needed.\r\n\r\nIt all made the city seem more subdued, like being inside an elevator,\r\nembarrassed by the close scrutiny of your neighbors and the ubiquitous\r\ncameras.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish coffee shop on 24th Street fixed me up good with a go-cup\r\nof Turkish coffee. Basically, Turkish coffee is mud, pretending to be\r\ncoffee. It's thick enough to stand a spoon up in, and it has way more\r\ncaffeine than the kiddee-pops like Red Bull. Take it from someone who's\r\nread the Wikipedia entry: this is how the Ottoman Empire was won:\r\nmaddened horsemen fueled by lethal jet-black coffee-mud.\r\n\r\nI pulled out my debit card to pay and he made a face. \"No more debit,\"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n\"Huh? Why not?\" I'd paid for my coffee habit on my card for years at\r\nthe Turk's. He used to hassle me all the time, telling me I was too\r\nyoung to drink the stuff, and he still refused to serve me at all\r\nduring school hours, convinced that I was skipping class. But over the\r\nyears, the Turk and me have developed a kind of gruff understanding.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head sadly. \"You wouldn't understand. Go to school, kid.\"\r\n\r\nThere's no surer way to make me want to understand than to tell me I\r\nwon't. I wheedled him, demanding that he tell me. He looked like he was\r\ngoing to throw me out, but when I asked him if he thought I wasn't good\r\nenough to shop there, he opened up.\r\n\r\n\"The security,\" he said, looking around his little shop with its tubs\r\nof dried beans and seeds, its shelves of Turkish groceries. \"The\r\ngovernment. They monitor it all now, it was in the papers. PATRIOT Act\r\nII, the Congress passed it yesterday. Now they can monitor every time\r\nyou use your card. I say no. I say my shop will not help them spy on my\r\ncustomers.\"\r\n\r\nMy jaw dropped.\r\n\r\n\"You think it's no big deal maybe? What is the problem with government\r\nknowing when you buy coffee? Because it's one way they know where you\r\nare, where you been. Why you think I left Turkey? Where you have\r\ngovernment always spying on the people, is no good. I move here twenty\r\nyears ago for freedom -- I no help them take freedom away.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're going to lose so many sales,\" I blurted. I wanted to tell him\r\nhe was a hero and shake his hand, but that was what came out. \"Everyone\r\nuses debit cards.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe not so much anymore. Maybe my customers come here because they\r\nknow I love freedom too. I am making sign for window. Maybe other\r\nstores do the same. I hear the ACLU will sue them for this.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've got all my business from now on,\" I said. I meant it. I reached\r\ninto my pocket. \"Um, I don't have any cash, though.\"\r\n\r\nHe pursed his lips and nodded. \"Many peoples say the same thing. Is OK.\r\nYou give today's money to the ACLU.\"\r\n\r\nIn two minutes, the Turk and I had exchanged more words than we had in\r\nall the time I'd been coming to his shop. I had no idea he had all\r\nthese passions. I just thought of him as my friendly neighborhood\r\ncaffeine dealer. Now I shook his hand and when I left his store, I felt\r\nlike he and I had joined a team. A secret team.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd missed two days of school but it seemed like I hadn't missed much\r\nclass. They'd shut the school on one of those days while the city\r\nscrambled to recover. The next day had been devoted, it seemed, to\r\nmourning those missing and presumed dead. The newspapers published\r\nbiographies of the lost, personal memorials. The Web was filled with\r\nthese capsule obituaries, thousands of them.\r\n\r\nEmbarrassingly, I was one of those people. I stepped into the\r\nschoolyard, not knowing this, and then there was a shout and a moment\r\nlater there were a hundred people around me, pounding me on the back,\r\nshaking my hand. A couple girls I didn't even know kissed me, and they\r\nwere more than friendly kisses. I felt like a rock star.\r\n\r\nMy teachers were only a little more subdued. Ms Galvez cried as much as\r\nmy mother had and hugged me three times before she let me go to my desk\r\nand sit down. There was something new at the front of the classroom. A\r\ncamera. Ms Galvez caught me staring at it and handed me a permission\r\nslip on smeary Xeroxed school letterhead.\r\n\r\nThe Board of the San Francisco Unified School District had held an\r\nemergency session over the weekend and unanimously voted to ask the\r\nparents of every kid in the city for permission to put closed circuit\r\ntelevision cameras in every classroom and corridor. The law said they\r\ncouldn't force us to go to school with cameras all over the place, but\r\nit didn't say anything about us *volunteering* to give up our\r\nConstitutional rights. The letter said that the Board were sure that\r\nthey would get complete compliance from the City's parents, but that\r\nthey would make arrangements to teach those kids' whose parents\r\nobjected in a separate set of \"unprotected\" classrooms.\r\n\r\nWhy did we have cameras in our classrooms now? Terrorists. Of course.\r\nBecause by blowing up a bridge, terrorists had indicated that schools\r\nwere next. Somehow that was the conclusion that the Board had reached\r\nanyway.\r\n\r\nI read this note three times and then I stuck my hand up.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Marcus?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ms Galvez, about this note?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Marcus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't the point of terrorism to make us afraid? That's why it's called\r\n*terror*ism, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose so.\" The class was staring at me. I wasn't the best student\r\nin school, but I did like a good in-class debate. They were waiting to\r\nhear what I'd say next.\r\n\r\n\"So aren't we doing what the terrorists want from us? Don't they win if\r\nwe act all afraid and put cameras in the classrooms and all of that?\"\r\n\r\nThere was some nervous tittering. One of the others put his hand up. It\r\nwas Charles. Ms Galvez called on him.\r\n\r\n\"Putting cameras in makes us safe, which makes us less afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Safe from what?\" I said, without waiting to be called on.\r\n\r\n\"Terrorism,\" Charles said. The others were nodding their heads.\r\n\r\n\"How do they do that? If a suicide bomber rushed in here and blew us\r\nall up --\"\r\n\r\n\"Ms Galvez, Marcus is violating school policy. We're not supposed to\r\nmake jokes about terrorist attacks --\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's making jokes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, both of you,\" Ms Galvez said. She looked really unhappy. I\r\nfelt kind of bad for hijacking her class. \"I think that this is a\r\nreally interesting discussion, but I'd like to hold it over for a\r\nfuture class. I think that these issues may be too emotional for us to\r\nhave a discussion about them today. Now, let's get back to the\r\nsuffragists, shall we?\"\r\n\r\nSo we spent the rest of the hour talking about suffragists and the new\r\nlobbying strategies they'd devised for getting four women into every\r\ncongresscritter's office to lean on him and let him know what it would\r\nmean for his political future if he kept on denying women the vote. It\r\nwas normally the kind of thing I really liked -- little guys making the\r\nbig and powerful be honest. But today I couldn't concentrate. It must\r\nhave been Darryl's absence. We both liked Social Studies and we would\r\nhave had our SchoolBooks out and an IM session up seconds after sitting\r\ndown, a back-channel for talking about the lesson.\r\n\r\nI'd burned twenty ParanoidXbox discs the night before and I had them\r\nall in my bag. I handed them out to people I knew were really, really\r\ninto gaming. They'd all gotten an Xbox Universal or two the year\r\nbefore, but most of them had stopped using them. The games were really\r\nexpensive and not a lot of fun. I took them aside between periods, at\r\nlunch and study hall, and sang the praises of the ParanoidXbox games to\r\nthe sky. Free and fun -- addictive social games with lots of cool\r\npeople playing them from all over the world.\r\n\r\nGiving away one thing to sell another is what they call a \"razor blade\r\nbusiness\" -- companies like Gillette give you free razor-blade handles\r\nand then stiff you by charging you a small fortune for the blades.\r\nPrinter cartridges are the worst for that -- the most expensive\r\nChampagne in the world is cheap when compared with inkjet ink, which\r\ncosts all of a penny a gallon to make wholesale.\r\n\r\nRazor-blade businesses depend on you not being able to get the \"blades\"\r\nfrom someone else. After all, if Gillette can make nine bucks on a\r\nten-dollar replacement blade, why not start a competitor that makes\r\nonly four bucks selling an identical blade: an 80 percent profit margin\r\nis the kind of thing that makes your average business-guy go all drooly\r\nand round-eyed.\r\n\r\nSo razor-blade companies like Microsoft pour a lot of effort into\r\nmaking it hard and/or illegal to compete with them on the blades. In\r\nMicrosoft's case, every Xbox has had countermeasures to keep you from\r\nrunning software that was released by people who didn't pay the\r\nMicrosoft blood-money for the right to sell Xbox programs.\r\n\r\nThe people I met didn't think much about this stuff. They perked up\r\nwhen I told them that the games were unmonitored. These days, any\r\nonline game you play is filled with all kinds of unsavory sorts. First\r\nthere are the pervs who try to get you to come out to some remote\r\nlocation so they can go all weird and Silence of the Lambs on you. Then\r\nthere are the cops, who are pretending to be gullible kids so they can\r\nbust the pervs. Worst of all, though, are the monitors who spend all\r\ntheir time spying on our discussions and snitching on us for violating\r\ntheir Terms of Service, which say, no flirting, no cussing, and no\r\n\"clear or masked language which insultingly refers to any aspect of\r\nsexual orientation or sexuality.\"\r\n\r\nI'm no 24/7 horn-dog, but I'm a seventeen year old boy. Sex does come\r\nup in conversation every now and again. But God help you if it came up\r\nin chat while you were gaming. It was a real buzz-kill. No one\r\nmonitored the ParanoidXbox games, because they weren't run by a\r\ncompany: they were just games that hackers had written for the hell of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSo these game-kids loved the story. They took the discs greedily, and\r\npromised to burn copies for all of their friends -- after all, games\r\nare most fun when you're playing them with your buddies.\r\n\r\nWhen I got home, I read that a group of parents were suing the school\r\nboard over the surveillance cameras in the classrooms, but that they'd\r\nalready lost their bid to get a preliminary injunction against them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't know who came up with the name Xnet, but it stuck. You'd hear\r\npeople talking about it on the Muni. Van called me up to ask me if I'd\r\nheard of it and I nearly choked once I figured out what she was talking\r\nabout: the discs I'd started distributing last week had been\r\nsneakernetted and copied all the way to Oakland in the space of two\r\nweeks. It made me look over my shoulder -- like I'd broken a rule and\r\nnow the DHS would come and take me away forever.\r\n\r\nThey'd been hard weeks. The BART had completely abandoned cash fares\r\nnow, switching them for arphid \"contactless\" cards that you waved at\r\nthe turnstiles to go through. They were cool and convenient, but every\r\ntime I used one, I thought about how I was being tracked. Someone on\r\nXnet posted a link to an Electronic Frontier Foundation white paper on\r\nthe ways that these things could be used to track people, and the paper\r\nhad tiny stories about little groups of people that had protested at\r\nthe BART stations.\r\n\r\nI used the Xnet for almost everything now. I'd set up a fake email\r\naddress through the Pirate Party, a Swedish political party that hated\r\nInternet surveillance and promised to keep their mail accounts a secret\r\nfrom everyone, even the cops. I accessed it strictly via Xnet, hopping\r\nfrom one neighbor's Internet connection to the next, staying anonymous\r\n-- I hoped -- all the way to Sweden. I wasn't using w1n5ton anymore. If\r\nBenson could figure it out, anyone could. My new handle, come up with\r\non the spur of the moment, was M1k3y, and I got a *lot* of email from\r\npeople who heard in chat rooms and message boards that I could help\r\nthem troubleshoot their Xnet configurations and connections.\r\n\r\nI missed Harajuku Fun Madness. The company had suspended the game\r\nindefinitely. They said that for \"security reasons\" they didn't think\r\nit would be a good idea to hide things and then send people off to find\r\nthem. What if someone thought it was a bomb? What if someone put a bomb\r\nin the same spot?\r\n\r\nWhat if I got hit by lightning while walking with an umbrella? Ban\r\numbrellas! Fight the menace of lightning!\r\n\r\nI kept on using my laptop, though I got a skin-crawly feeling when I\r\nused it. Whoever had wiretapped it would wonder why I didn't use it. I\r\nfigured I'd just do some random surfing with it every day, a little\r\nless each day, so that anyone watching would see me slowly changing my\r\nhabits, not doing a sudden reversal. Mostly I read those creepy obits\r\n-- all those thousands of my friends and neighbors dead at the bottom\r\nof the Bay.\r\n\r\nTruth be told, I *was* doing less and less homework every day. I had\r\nbusiness elsewhere. I burned new stacks of ParanoidXbox every day,\r\nfifty or sixty, and took them around the city to people I'd heard were\r\nwilling to burn sixty of their own and hand them out to their friends.\r\n\r\nI wasn't too worried about getting caught doing this, because I had\r\ngood crypto on my side. Crypto is cryptography, or \"secret writing,\"\r\nand it's been around since Roman times (literally: Augustus Caesar was\r\na big fan and liked to invent his own codes, some of which we use today\r\nfor scrambling joke punchlines in email).\r\n\r\nCrypto is math. Hard math. I'm not going to try to explain it in detail\r\nbecause I don't have the math to really get my head around it, either\r\n-- look it up on Wikipedia if you really want.\r\n\r\nBut here's the Cliff's Notes version: Some kinds of mathematical\r\nfunctions are really easy to do in one direction and really hard to do\r\nin the other direction. It's easy to multiply two big prime numbers\r\ntogether and make a giant number. It's really, really hard to take any\r\ngiven giant number and figure out which primes multiply together to\r\ngive you that number.\r\n\r\nThat means that if you can come up with a way of scrambling something\r\nbased on multiplying large primes, unscrambling it without knowing\r\nthose primes will be hard. Wicked hard. Like, a trillion years of all\r\nthe computers ever invented working 24/7 won't be able to do it.\r\n\r\nThere are four parts to any crypto message: the original message,\r\ncalled the \"cleartext.\" The scrambled message, called the \"ciphertext.\"\r\nThe scrambling system, called the \"cipher.\" And finally there's the\r\nkey: secret stuff you feed into the cipher along with the cleartext to\r\nmake ciphertext.\r\n\r\nIt used to be that crypto people tried to keep all of this a secret.\r\nEvery agency and government had its own ciphers *and* its own keys. The\r\nNazis and the Allies didn't want the other guys to know how they\r\nscrambled their messages, let alone the keys that they could use to\r\ndescramble them. That sounds like a good idea, right?\r\n\r\nWrong.\r\n\r\nThe first time anyone told me about all this prime factoring stuff, I\r\nimmediately said, \"No way, that's BS. I mean, *sure* it's hard to do\r\nthis prime factorization stuff, whatever you say it is. But it used to\r\nbe impossible to fly or go to the moon or get a hard-drive with more\r\nthan a few kilobytes of storage. Someone *must* have invented a way of\r\ndescrambling the messages.\" I had visions of a hollow mountain full of\r\nNational Security Agency mathematicians reading every email in the\r\nworld and snickering.\r\n\r\nIn fact, that's pretty much what happened during World War II. That's\r\nthe reason that life isn't more like Castle Wolfenstein, where I've\r\nspent many days hunting Nazis.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, ciphers are hard to keep secret. There's a lot of math\r\nthat goes into one, and if they're widely used, then everyone who uses\r\nthem has to keep them a secret too, and if someone changes sides, you\r\nhave to find a new cipher.\r\n\r\nThe Nazi cipher was called Enigma, and they used a little mechanical\r\ncomputer called an Enigma Machine to scramble and unscramble the\r\nmessages they got. Every sub and boat and station needed one of these,\r\nso it was inevitable that eventually the Allies would get their hands\r\non one.\r\n\r\nWhen they did, they cracked it. That work was led by my personal\r\nall-time hero, a guy named Alan Turing, who pretty much invented\r\ncomputers as we know them today. Unfortunately for him, he was gay, so\r\nafter the war ended, the stupid British government forced him to get\r\nshot up with hormones to \"cure\" his homosexuality and he killed\r\nhimself. Darryl gave me a biography of Turing for my 14th birthday --\r\nwrapped in twenty layers of paper and in a recycled Batmobile toy, he\r\nwas like that with presents -- and I've been a Turing junkie ever\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nNow the Allies had the Enigma Machine, and they could intercept lots of\r\nNazi radio-messages, which shouldn't have been that big a deal, since\r\nevery captain had his own secret key. Since the Allies didn't have the\r\nkeys, having the machine shouldn't have helped.\r\n\r\nHere's where secrecy hurts crypto. The Enigma cipher was flawed. Once\r\nTuring looked hard at it, he figured out that the Nazi cryptographers\r\nhad made a mathematical mistake. By getting his hands on an Enigma\r\nMachine, Turing could figure out how to crack *any* Nazi message, no\r\nmatter what key it used.\r\n\r\nThat cost the Nazis the war. I mean, don't get me wrong. That's good\r\nnews. Take it from a Castle Wolfenstein veteran. You wouldn't want the\r\nNazis running the country.\r\n\r\nAfter the war, cryptographers spent a lot of time thinking about this.\r\nThe problem had been that Turing was smarter than the guy who thought\r\nup Enigma. Any time you had a cipher, you were vulnerable to someone\r\nsmarter than you coming up with a way of breaking it.\r\n\r\nAnd the more they thought about it, the more they realized that\r\n*anyone* can come up with a security system that he can't figure out\r\nhow to break. But *no one* can figure out what a smarter person might\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nYou have to publish a cipher to know that it works. You have to tell\r\n*as many people as possible* how it works, so that they can thwack on\r\nit with everything they have, testing its security. The longer you go\r\nwithout anyone finding a flaw, the more secure you are.\r\n\r\nWhich is how it stands today. If you want to be safe, you don't use\r\ncrypto that some genius thought of last week. You use the stuff that\r\npeople have been using for as long as possible without anyone figuring\r\nout how to break them. Whether you're a bank, a terrorist, a government\r\nor a teenager, you use the same ciphers.\r\n\r\nIf you tried to use your own cipher, there'd be the chance that someone\r\nout there had found a flaw you missed and was doing a Turing on your\r\nbutt, deciphering all your \"secret\" messages and chuckling at your dumb\r\ngossip, financial transactions and military secrets.\r\n\r\nSo I knew that crypto would keep me safe from eavesdroppers, but I\r\nwasn't ready to deal with histograms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI got off the BART and waved my card over the turnstile as I headed up\r\nto the 24th Street station. As usual, there were lots of weirdos\r\nhanging out in the station, drunks and Jesus freaks and intense Mexican\r\nmen staring at the ground and a few gang kids. I looked straight past\r\nthem as I hit the stairs and jogged up to the surface. My bag was empty\r\nnow, no longer bulging with the ParanoidXbox discs I'd been\r\ndistributing, and it made my shoulders feel light and put a spring in\r\nmy step as I came up the street. The preachers were at work still,\r\nexhorting in Spanish and English about Jesus and so on.\r\n\r\nThe counterfeit sunglass sellers were gone, but they'd been replaced by\r\nguys selling robot dogs that barked the national anthem and would lift\r\ntheir legs if you showed them a picture of Osama bin Laden. There was\r\nprobably some cool stuff going on in their little brains and I made a\r\nmental note to pick a couple of them up and take them apart later.\r\nFace-recognition was pretty new in toys, having only recently made the\r\nleap from the military to casinos trying to find cheats, to law\r\nenforcement.\r\n\r\nI started down 24th Street toward Potrero Hill and home, rolling my\r\nshoulders and smelling the burrito smells wafting out of the\r\nrestaurants and thinking about dinner.\r\n\r\nI don't know why I happened to glance back over my shoulder, but I did.\r\nMaybe it was a little bit of subconscious sixth-sense stuff. I knew I\r\nwas being followed.\r\n\r\nThey were two beefy white guys with little mustaches that made me think\r\nof either cops or the gay bikers who rode up and down the Castro, but\r\ngay guys usually had better haircuts. They had on windbreakers the\r\ncolor of old cement and blue-jeans, with their waistbands concealed. I\r\nthought of all the things a cop might wear on his waistband, of the\r\nutility-belt that DHS guy in the truck had worn. Both guys were wearing\r\nBluetooth headsets.\r\n\r\nI kept walking, my heart thumping in my chest. I'd been expecting this\r\nsince I started. I'd been expecting the DHS to figure out what I was\r\ndoing. I took every precaution, but Severe-Haircut woman had told me\r\nthat she'd be watching me. She'd told me I was a marked man. I realized\r\nthat I'd been waiting to get picked up and taken back to jail. Why not?\r\nWhy should Darryl be in jail and not me? What did I have going for me?\r\nI hadn't even had the guts to tell my parents -- or his -- what had\r\nreally happened to us.\r\n\r\nI quickened my steps and took a mental inventory. I didn't have\r\nanything incriminating in my bag. Not too incriminating, anyway. My\r\nSchoolBook was running the crack that let me IM and stuff, but half the\r\npeople in school had that. I'd changed the way I encrypted the stuff on\r\nmy phone -- now I *did* have a fake partition that I could turn back\r\ninto cleartext with one password, but all the good stuff was hidden,\r\nand needed another password to open up. That hidden section looked just\r\nlike random junk -- when you encrypt data, it becomes indistinguishable\r\nfrom random noise -- and they'd never even know it was there.\r\n\r\nThere were no discs in my bag. My laptop was free of incriminating\r\nevidence. Of course, if they thought to look hard at my Xbox, it was\r\ngame over. So to speak.\r\n\r\nI stopped where I was standing. I'd done as good a job as I could of\r\ncovering myself. It was time to face my fate. I stepped into the\r\nnearest burrito joint and ordered one with carnitas -- shredded pork --\r\nand extra salsa. Might as well go down with a full stomach. I got a\r\nbucket of horchata, too, an ice-cold rice drink that's like watery,\r\nsemi-sweet rice-pudding (better than it sounds).\r\n\r\nI sat down to eat, and a profound calm fell over me. I was about to go\r\nto jail for my \"crimes,\" or I wasn't. My freedom since they'd taken me\r\nin had been just a temporary holiday. My country was not my friend\r\nanymore: we were now on different sides and I'd known I could never\r\nwin.\r\n\r\nThe two guys came into the restaurant as I was finishing the burrito\r\nand going up to order some churros -- deep-fried dough with cinnamon\r\nsugar -- for dessert. I guess they'd been waiting outside and got tired\r\nof my dawdling.\r\n\r\nThey stood behind me at the counter, boxing me in. I took my churro\r\nfrom the pretty granny and paid her, taking a couple of quick bites of\r\nthe dough before I turned around. I wanted to eat at least a little of\r\nmy dessert. It might be the last dessert I got for a long, long time.\r\n\r\nThen I turned around. They were both so close I could see the zit on\r\nthe cheek of the one on the left, the little booger up the nose of the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\"'Scuse me,\" I said, trying to push past them. The one with the booger\r\nmoved to block me.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" he said, \"can you step over here with us?\" He gestured toward\r\nthe restaurant's door.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, I'm eating,\" I said and moved again. This time he put his hand\r\non my chest. He was breathing fast through his nose, making the booger\r\nwiggle. I think I was breathing hard too, but it was hard to tell over\r\nthe hammering of my heart.\r\n\r\nThe other one flipped down a flap on the front of his windbreaker to\r\nreveal a SFPD insignia. \"Police,\" he said. \"Please come with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me just get my stuff,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"We'll take care of that,\" he said. The booger one stepped right up\r\nclose to me, his foot on the inside of mine. You do that in some\r\nmartial arts, too. It lets you feel if the other guy is shifting his\r\nweight, getting ready to move.\r\n\r\nI wasn't going to run, though. I knew I couldn't outrun fate.\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nChapter 7\r\n\r\n[[This chapter is dedicated to New York City's Books of Wonder, the\r\noldest and largest kids' bookstore in Manhattan. They're located just a\r\nfew blocks away from Tor Books' offices in the Flatiron Building and\r\nevery time I drop in to meet with the Tor people, I always sneak away\r\nto Books of Wonder to peruse their stock of new, used and rare kids'\r\nbooks. I'm a heavy collector of rare editions of Alice in Wonderland,\r\nand Books of Wonder never fails to excite me with some beautiful,\r\nlimited-edition Alice. They have tons of events for kids and one of the\r\nmost inviting atmospheres I've ever experienced at a bookstore.]]\r\n\r\n[[Books of Wonder http://www.booksofwonder.com/ 18 West 18th St, New\r\nYork, NY 10011 USA +1 212 989 3270]]\r\n\r\nThey took me outside and around the corner, to a waiting unmarked\r\npolice car. It wasn't like anyone in that neighborhood would have had a\r\nhard time figuring out that it was a cop-car, though. Only police drive\r\nbig Crown Victorias now that gas had hit seven bucks a gallon. What's\r\nmore, only cops could double-park in the middle of Van Ness street\r\nwithout getting towed by the schools of predatory tow-operators that\r\ncircled endlessly, ready to enforce San Francisco's incomprehensible\r\nparking regulations and collect a bounty for kidnapping your car.\r\n\r\nBooger blew his nose. I was sitting in the back seat, and so was he.\r\nHis partner was sitting in the front, typing with one finger on an\r\nancient, ruggedized laptop that looked like Fred Flintstone had been\r\nits original owner.\r\n\r\nBooger looked closely at my ID again. \"We just want to ask you a few\r\nroutine questions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I see your badges?\" I said. These guys were clearly cops, but it\r\ncouldn't hurt to let them know I knew my rights.\r\n\r\nBooger flashed his badge at me too fast for me to get a good look at\r\nit, but Zit in the front seat gave me a long look at his. I got their\r\ndivision number and memorized the four-digit badge number. It was easy:\r\n1337 is also the way hackers write \"leet,\" or \"elite.\"\r\n\r\nThey were both being very polite and neither of them was trying to\r\nintimidate me the way that the DHS had done when I was in their\r\ncustody.\r\n\r\n\"Am I under arrest?\"\r\n\r\n\"You've been momentarily detained so that we can ensure your safety and\r\nthe general public safety,\" Booger said.\r\n\r\nHe passed my driver's license up to Zit, who pecked it slowly into his\r\ncomputer. I saw him make a typo and almost corrected him, but figured\r\nit was better to just keep my mouth shut.\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything you want to tell me, Marcus? Do they call you Marc?\"\r\n\r\n\"Marcus is fine,\" I said. Booger looked like he might be a nice guy.\r\nExcept for the part about kidnapping me into his car, of course.\r\n\r\n\"Marcus. Anything you want to tell me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like what? Am I under arrest?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're not under arrest right now,\" Booger said. \"Would you like to\r\nbe?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Good. We've been watching you since you left the BART. Your Fast Pass\r\nsays that you've been riding to a lot of strange places at a lot of\r\nfunny hours.\"\r\n\r\nI felt something let go inside my chest. This wasn't about the Xnet at\r\nall, then, not really. They'd been watching my subway use and wanted to\r\nknow why it had been so freaky lately. How totally stupid.\r\n\r\n\"So you guys follow everyone who comes out of the BART station with a\r\nfunny ride-history? You must be busy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not everyone, Marcus. We get an alert when anyone with an uncommon\r\nride profile comes out and that helps us assess whether we want to\r\ninvestigate. In your case, we came along because we wanted to know why\r\na smart-looking kid like you had such a funny ride profile?\"\r\n\r\nNow that I knew I wasn't about to go to jail, I was getting pissed.\r\nThese guys had no business spying on me -- Christ, the BART had no\r\nbusiness *helping* them to spy on me. Where the hell did my subway pass\r\nget off on finking me out for having a \"nonstandard ride pattern?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I'd like to be arrested now,\" I said.\r\n\r\nBooger sat back and raised his eyebrow at me.\r\n\r\n\"Really? On what charge?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you mean riding public transit in a nonstandard way isn't a\r\ncrime?\"\r\n\r\nZit closed his eyes and scrubbed them with his thumbs.\r\n\r\nBooger sighed a put-upon sigh. \"Look, Marcus, we're on your side here.\r\nWe use this system to catch bad guys. To catch terrorists and drug\r\ndealers. Maybe you're a drug dealer yourself. Pretty good way to get\r\naround the city, a Fast Pass. Anonymous.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong with anonymous? It was good enough for Thomas Jefferson.\r\nAnd by the way, am I under arrest?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's take him home,\" Zit said. \"We can talk to his parents.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that's a great idea,\" I said. \"I'm sure my parents will be\r\nanxious to hear how their tax dollars are being spent --\"\r\n\r\nI'd pushed it too far. Booger had been reaching for the door handle but\r\nnow he whirled on me, all Hulked out and throbbing veins. \"Why don't\r\nyou shut up right now, while it's still an option? After everything\r\nthat's happened in the past two weeks, it wouldn't kill you to\r\ncooperate with us. You know what, maybe we *should* arrest you. You can\r\nspend a day or two in jail while your lawyer looks for you. A lot can\r\nhappen in that time. A *lot*. How'd you like that?\"\r\n\r\nI didn't say anything. I'd been giddy and angry. Now I was scared\r\nwitless.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" I managed, hating myself again for saying it.\r\n\r\nBooger got in the front seat and Zit put the car in gear, cruising up\r\n24th Street and over Potrero Hill. They had my address from my ID.\r\n\r\nMom answered the door after they rang the bell, leaving the chain on.\r\nShe peeked around it, saw me and said, \"Marcus? Who are these men?\"\r\n\r\n\"Police,\" Booger said. He showed her his badge, letting her get a good\r\nlook at it -- not whipping it away the way he had with me. \"Can we come\r\nin?\"\r\n\r\nMom closed the door and took the chain off and let them in. They\r\nbrought me in and Mom gave the three of us one of her looks.\r\n\r\n\"What's this about?\"\r\n\r\nBooger pointed at me. \"We wanted to ask your son some routine questions\r\nabout his movements, but he declined to answer them. We felt it might\r\nbe best to bring him here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he under arrest?\" Mom's accent was coming on strong. Good old Mom.\r\n\r\n\"Are you a United States citizen, ma'am?\" Zit said.\r\n\r\nShe gave him a look that could have stripped paint. \"I shore am,\r\nhyuck,\" she said, in a broad southern accent. \"Am *I* under arrest?\"\r\n\r\nThe two cops exchanged a look.\r\n\r\nZit took the fore. \"We seem to have gotten off to a bad start. We\r\nidentified your son as someone with a nonstandard public transit usage\r\npattern, as part of a new pro-active enforcement program. When we spot\r\npeople whose travels are unusual, or that match a suspicious profile,\r\nwe investigate further.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait,\" Mom said. \"How do you know how my son uses the Muni?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Fast Pass,\" he said. \"It tracks voyages.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" Mom said, folding her arms. Folding her arms was a bad sign.\r\nIt was bad enough she hadn't offered them a cup of tea -- in Mom-land,\r\nthat was practically like making them shout through the mail-slot --\r\nbut once she folded her arms, it was not going to end well for them. At\r\nthat moment, I wanted to go and buy her a big bunch of flowers.\r\n\r\n\"Marcus here declined to tell us why his movements had been what they\r\nwere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you saying you think my son is a terrorist because of how he rides\r\nthe bus?\"\r\n\r\n\"Terrorists aren't the only bad guys we catch this way,\" Zit said.\r\n\"Drug dealers. Gang kids. Even shoplifters smart enough to hit a\r\ndifferent neighborhood with every run.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think my son is a drug dealer?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're not saying that --\" Zit began. Mom clapped her hands at him to\r\nshut him up.\r\n\r\n\"Marcus, please pass me your backpack.\"\r\n\r\nI did.\r\n\r\nMom unzipped it and looked through it, turning her back to us first.\r\n\r\n\"Officers, I can now affirm that there are no narcotics, explosives, or\r\nshoplifted gewgaws in my son's bag. I think we're done here. I would\r\nlike your badge numbers before you go, please.\"\r\n\r\nBooger sneered at her. \"Lady, the ACLU is suing three hundred cops on\r\nthe SFPD, you're going to have to get in line.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMom made me a cup of tea and then chewed me out for eating dinner when\r\nI knew that she'd been making falafel. Dad came home while we were\r\nstill at the table and Mom and I took turns telling him the story. He\r\nshook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Lillian, they were just doing their jobs.\" He was still wearing the\r\nblue blazer and khakis he wore on the days that he was consulting in\r\nSilicon Valley. \"The world isn't the same place it was last week.\"\r\n\r\nMom set down her teacup. \"Drew, you're being ridiculous. Your son is\r\nnot a terrorist. His use of the public transit system is not cause for\r\na police investigation.\"\r\n\r\nDad took off his blazer. \"We do this all the time at my work. It's how\r\ncomputers can be used to find all kinds of errors, anomalies and\r\noutcomes. You ask the computer to create a profile of an average record\r\nin a database and then ask it to find out which records in the database\r\nare furthest away from average. It's part of something called Bayesian\r\nanalysis and it's been around for centuries now. Without it, we\r\ncouldn't do spam-filtering --\"\r\n\r\n\"So you're saying that you think the police should suck as hard as my\r\nspam filter?\" I said.\r\n\r\nDad never got angry at me for arguing with him, but tonight I could see\r\nthe strain was running high in him. Still, I couldn't resist. My own\r\nfather, taking the police's side!\r\n\r\n\"I'm saying that it's perfectly reasonable for the police to conduct\r\ntheir investigations by starting with data-mining, and then following\r\nit up with leg-work where a human being actually intervenes to see why\r\nthe abnormality exists. I don't think that a computer should be telling\r\nthe police whom to arrest, just helping them sort through the haystack\r\nto find a needle.\"\r\n\r\n\"But by taking in all that data from the transit system, they're\r\n*creating the haystack*,\" I said. \"That's a gigantic mountain of data\r\nand there's almost nothing worth looking at there, from the police's\r\npoint of view. It's a total waste.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand that you don't like that this system caused you some\r\ninconvenience, Marcus. But you of all people should appreciate the\r\ngravity of the situation. There was no harm done, was there? They even\r\ngave you a ride home.\"\r\n\r\n*They threatened to send me to jail,* I thought, but I could see there\r\nwas no point in saying it.\r\n\r\n\"Besides, you still haven't told us where the blazing hells you've been\r\nto create such an unusual traffic pattern.\"\r\n\r\nThat brought me up short.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you relied on my judgment, that you didn't want to spy on\r\nme.\" He'd said this often enough. \"Do you really want me to account for\r\nevery trip I've ever taken?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hooked up my Xbox as soon as I got to my room. I'd bolted the\r\nprojector to the ceiling so that it could shine on the wall over my bed\r\n(I'd had to take down my awesome mural of punk rock handbills I'd taken\r\ndown off telephone poles and glued to big sheets of white paper).\r\n\r\nI powered up the Xbox and watched as it came onto the screen. I was\r\ngoing to email Van and Jolu to tell them about the hassles with the\r\ncops, but as I put my fingers to the keyboard, I stopped again.\r\n\r\nA feeling crept over me, one not unlike the feeling I'd had when I\r\nrealized that they'd turned poor old Salmagundi into a traitor. This\r\ntime, it was the feeling that my beloved Xnet might be broadcasting the\r\nlocation of every one of its users to the DHS.\r\n\r\nIt was what Dad had said: *You ask the computer to create a profile of\r\nan average record in a database and then ask it to find out which\r\nrecords in the database are furthest away from average.*\r\n\r\nThe Xnet was secure because its users weren't directly connected to the\r\nInternet. They hopped from Xbox to Xbox until they found one that was\r\nconnected to the Internet, then they injected their material as\r\nundecipherable, encrypted data. No one could tell which of the\r\nInternet's packets were Xnet and which ones were just plain old banking\r\nand e-commerce and other encrypted communication. You couldn't find out\r\nwho was tying the Xnet, let alone who was using the Xnet.\r\n\r\nBut what about Dad's \"Bayesian statistics?\" I'd played with Bayesian\r\nmath before. Darryl and I once tried to write our own better spam\r\nfilter and when you filter spam, you need Bayesian math. Thomas Bayes\r\nwas an 18th century British mathematician that no one cared about until\r\na couple hundred years after he died, when computer scientists realized\r\nthat his technique for statistically analyzing mountains of data would\r\nbe super-useful for the modern world's info-Himalayas.\r\n\r\nHere's some of how Bayesian stats work. Say you've got a bunch of spam.\r\nYou take every word that's in the spam and count how many times it\r\nappears. This is called a \"word frequency histogram\" and it tells you\r\nwhat the probability is that any bag of words is likely to be spam.\r\nNow, take a ton of email that's not spam -- in the biz, they call that\r\n\"ham\" -- and do the same.\r\n\r\nWait until a new email arrives and count the words that appear in it.\r\nThen use the word-frequency histogram in the candidate message to\r\ncalculate the probability that it belongs in the \"spam\" pile or the\r\n\"ham\" pile. If it turns out to be spam, you adjust the \"spam\" histogram\r\naccordingly. There are lots of ways to refine the technique -- looking\r\nat words in pairs, throwing away old data -- but this is how it works\r\nat core. It's one of those great, simple ideas that seems obvious after\r\nyou hear about it.\r\n\r\nIt's got lots of applications -- you can ask a computer to count the\r\nlines in a picture and see if it's more like a \"dog\" line-frequency\r\nhistogram or a \"cat\" line-frequency histogram. It can find porn, bank\r\nfraud, and flamewars. Useful stuff.\r\n\r\nAnd it was bad news for the Xnet. Say you had the whole Internet\r\nwiretapped -- which, of course, the DHS has. You can't tell who's\r\npassing Xnet packets by looking at the contents of those packets,\r\nthanks to crypto.\r\n\r\nWhat you *can* do is find out who is sending way, way more encrypted\r\ntraffic out than everyone else. For a normal Internet surfer, a session\r\nonline is probably about 95 percent cleartext, five percent ciphertext.\r\nIf someone is sending out 95 percent ciphertext, maybe you could\r\ndispatch the computer-savvy equivalents of Booger and Zit to ask them\r\nif they're terrorist drug-dealer Xnet users.\r\n\r\nThis happens all the time in China. Some smart dissident will get the\r\nidea of getting around the Great Firewall of China, which is used to\r\ncensor the whole country's Internet connection, by using an encrypted\r\nconnection to a computer in some other country. Now, the Party there\r\ncan't tell what the dissident is surfing: maybe it's porn, or\r\nbomb-making instructions, or dirty letters from his girlfriend in the\r\nPhilippines, or political material, or good news about Scientology.\r\nThey don't have to know. All they have to know is that this guy gets\r\nway more encrypted traffic than his neighbors. At that point, they send\r\nhim to a forced labor camp just to set an example so that everyone can\r\nsee what happens to smart-asses.\r\n\r\nSo far, I was willing to bet that the Xnet was under the DHS's radar,\r\nbut it wouldn't be the case forever. And after tonight, I wasn't sure\r\nthat I was in any better shape than a Chinese dissident. I was putting\r\nall the people who signed onto the Xnet in jeopardy. The law didn't\r\ncare if you were actually doing anything bad; they were willing to put\r\nyou under the microscope just for being statistically abnormal. And I\r\ncouldn't even stop it -- now that the Xnet was running, it had a life\r\nof its own.\r\n\r\nI was going to have to fix it some other way.\r\n\r\nI wished I could talk to Jolu about this. He worked at an Internet\r\nService Provider called Pigspleen Net that had hired him when he was\r\ntwelve, and he knew way more about the net than I did. If anyone knew\r\nhow to keep our butts out of jail, it would be him.\r\n\r\nLuckily, Van and Jolu and I were planning to meet for coffee the next\r\nnight at our favorite place in the Mission after school. Officially, it\r\nwas our weekly Harajuku Fun Madness team meeting, but with the game\r\ncanceled and Darryl gone, it was pretty much just a weekly weep-fest,\r\nsupplemented by about six phone-calls and IMs a day that went, \"Are you\r\nOK? Did  it really happen?\" It would be good to have something else to\r\ntalk about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You're out of your mind,\" Vanessa said. \"Are you actually, totally,\r\nreally, for-real crazy or what?\"\r\n\r\nShe had shown up in her girl's school uniform because she'd been stuck\r\ngoing the long way home, all the way down to the San Mateo bridge then\r\nback up into the city, on a shuttle-bus service that her school was\r\noperating. She hated being seen in public in her gear, which was\r\ntotally Sailor Moon -- a pleated skirt and a tunic and knee-socks.\r\nShe'd been in a bad mood ever since she turned up at the cafe, which\r\nwas full of older, cooler, mopey emo art students who snickered into\r\ntheir lattes when she turned up.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want me to do, Van?\" I said. I was getting exasperated\r\nmyself. School was unbearable now that the game wasn't on, now that\r\nDarryl was missing. All day long, in my classes, I consoled myself with\r\nthe thought of seeing my team, what was left of it. Now we were\r\nfighting.\r\n\r\n\"I want you to stop putting yourself at risk, M1k3y.\" The hairs on the\r\nback of my neck stood up. Sure, we always used our team handles at team\r\nmeetings, but now that my handle was also associated with my Xnet use,\r\nit scared me to hear it said aloud in a public place.\r\n\r\n\"Don't use that name in public anymore,\" I snapped.\r\n\r\nVan shook her head. \"That's just what I'm talking about. You could end\r\nup going to jail for this, Marcus, and not just you. Lots of people.\r\nAfter what happened to Darryl --\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm doing this for Darryl!\" Art students swiveled to look at us and I\r\nlowered my voice. \"I'm doing this because the alternative is to let\r\nthem get away with it all.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think you're going to stop them? You're out of your mind. They're\r\nthe government.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's still our country,\" I said. \"We still have the right to do this.\"\r\n\r\nVan looked like she was going to cry. She took a couple of deep breaths\r\nand stood up. \"I can't do it, I'm sorry. I can't watch you do this.\r\nIt's like watching a car-wreck in slow motion. You're going to destroy\r\nyourself, and I love you too much to watch it happen.\"\r\n\r\nShe bent down and gave me a fierce hug and a hard kiss on the cheek\r\nthat caught the edge of my mouth. \"Take care of yourself, Marcus,\" she\r\nsaid. My mouth burned where her lips had pressed it. She gave Jolu the\r\nsame treatment, but square on the cheek. Then she left.\r\n\r\nJolu and I stared at each other after she'd gone.\r\n\r\nI put my face in my hands. \"Dammit,\" I said, finally.\r\n\r\nJolu patted me on the back and ordered me another latte. \"It'll be OK,\"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n\"You'd think Van, of all people, would understand.\" Half of Van's\r\nfamily lived in North Korea. Her parents never forgot that they had all\r\nthose people living under a  crazy dictator, not able to escape to\r\nAmerica, the way her parents had.\r\n\r\nJolu shrugged. \"Maybe that's why she's so freaked out. Because she\r\nknows how dangerous it can get.\"\r\n\r\nI knew what he was talking about. Two of Van's uncles had gone to jail\r\nand had never reappeared.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"So how come you weren't on Xnet last night?\"\r\n\r\nI was grateful for the distraction. I explained it all to him, the\r\nBayesian stuff and my fear that we couldn't go on using Xnet the way we\r\nhad been without getting nabbed. He listened thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"I see what you're saying. The problem is that if there's too much\r\ncrypto in someone's Internet connection, they'll stand out as unusual.\r\nBut if you don't encrypt, you'll make it easy for the bad guys to\r\nwiretap you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" I said. \"I've been trying to figure it out all day. Maybe we\r\ncould slow the connection down, spread it out over more peoples'\r\naccounts --\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't work,\" he said. \"To get it slow enough to vanish into the noise,\r\nyou'd have to basically shut down the network, which isn't an option.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right,\" I said. \"But what else can we do?\"\r\n\r\n\"What if we changed the definition of normal?\"\r\n\r\nAnd that was why Jolu got hired to work at Pigspleen when he was 12.\r\nGive him a problem with two bad solutions and he'd figure out a third\r\ntotally different solution based on throwing away all your assumptions.\r\nI nodded vigorously. \"Go on, tell me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What if the average San Francisco Internet user had a *lot* more\r\ncrypto in his average day on the Internet? If we could change the split\r\nso it's more like fifty-fifty cleartext to ciphertext, then the users\r\nthat supply the Xnet would just look like normal.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how do we do that? People just don't care enough about their\r\nprivacy to surf the net through an encrypted link. They don't see why\r\nit matters if eavesdroppers know what they're googling for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, but web-pages are small amounts of traffic. If we got people to\r\nroutinely download a few giant encrypted files every day, that would\r\ncreate as much ciphertext as thousands of web-pages.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're talking about indienet,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"You got it,\" he said.\r\n\r\nindienet -- all lower case, always -- was the thing that made Pigspleen\r\nNet into one of the most successful independent ISPs in the world. Back\r\nwhen the major record labels started suing their fans for downloading\r\ntheir music, a lot of the independent labels and their artists were\r\naghast. How can you make money by suing your customers?\r\n\r\nPigspleen's founder had the answer: she opened up a deal for any act\r\nthat wanted to work with their fans instead of fighting them. Give\r\nPigspleen a license to distribute your music to its customers and it\r\nwould give you a share of the subscription fees based on how popular\r\nyour music was. For an indie artist, the big problem isn't piracy, it's\r\nobscurity: no one even cares enough about your tunes to steal 'em.\r\n\r\nIt worked. Hundreds of independent acts and labels signed up with\r\nPigspleen, and the more music there was, the more fans switched to\r\ngetting their Internet service from Pigspleen, and the more money there\r\nwas for the artists. Inside of a year, the ISP had a hundred thousand\r\nnew customers and now it had a million -- more than half the broadband\r\nconnections in the city.\r\n\r\n\"An overhaul of the indienet code has been on my plate for months now,\"\r\nJolu said. \"The original programs were written really fast and dirty\r\nand they could be made a lot more efficient with a little work. But I\r\njust haven't had the time. One of the high-marked to-do items has been\r\nto encrypt the connections, just because Trudy likes it that way.\"\r\nTrudy Doo was the founder of Pigspleen. She was an old time San\r\nFrancisco punk legend, the singer/front-woman of the anarcho-feminist\r\nband Speedwhores, and she was crazy about privacy. I could totally\r\nbelieve that she'd want her music service encrypted on general\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\n\"Will it be hard? I mean, how long would it take?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there's tons of crypto code for free online, of course,\" Jolu\r\nsaid. He was doing the thing he did when he was digging into a meaty\r\ncode problem -- getting that faraway look, drumming his palms on the\r\ntable, making the coffee slosh into the saucers. I wanted to laugh --\r\neverything might be destroyed and crap and scary, but Jolu would write\r\nthat code.\r\n\r\n\"Can I help?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me. \"What, you don't think I can manage it?\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean, you did this whole Xnet thing without even telling me. Without\r\ntalking to me. I kind of thought that you didn't need my help with this\r\nstuff.\"\r\n\r\nI was brought up short. \"What?\" I said again. Jolu was looking really\r\nsteamed now. It was clear that this had been eating him for a long\r\ntime. \"Jolu --\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me and I could see that he was furious. How had I missed\r\nthis? God, I was such an idiot sometimes. \"Look dude, it's not a big\r\ndeal --\" by which he clearly meant that it was a really big deal \"--\r\nit's just that you know, you never even *asked*. I hate the DHS. Darryl\r\nwas my friend too. I could have really helped with it.\"\r\n\r\nI wanted to stick my head between my knees. \"Listen Jolu, that was\r\nreally stupid of me. I did it at like two in the morning. I was just\r\ncrazy when it was happening. I --\" I couldn't explain it. Yeah, he was\r\nright, and that was the problem. It had been two in the morning but I\r\ncould have talked to Jolu about it the next day or the next. I hadn't\r\nbecause I'd known what he'd say -- that it was an ugly hack, that I\r\nneeded to think it through better. Jolu was always figuring out how to\r\nturn my 2 AM ideas into real code, but the stuff that he came out with\r\nwas always a little different from what I'd come up with. I'd wanted\r\nthe project for myself. I'd gotten totally into being M1k3y.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said at last. \"I'm really, really sorry. You're totally\r\nright. I just got freaked out and did something stupid. I really need\r\nyour help. I can't make this work without you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I mean it,\" I said. \"You're the best coder I know. You're a\r\ngoddamned genius, Jolu. I would be honored if you'd help me with this.\"\r\n\r\nHe drummed his fingers some more. \"It's just -- You know. You're the\r\nleader. Van's the smart one. Darryl was... He was your\r\nsecond-in-command, the guy who had it all organized, who watched the\r\ndetails. Being the programmer, that was *my* thing. It felt like you\r\nwere saying you didn't need me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh man, I am such an idiot. Jolu, you're the best-qualified person I\r\nknow to do this. I'm really, really, really --\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, already. Stop. Fine. I believe you. We're all really\r\nscrewed up right now. So yeah, of course you can help. We can probably\r\neven pay you -- I've got a little budget for contract programmers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really?\" No one had ever paid me for writing code.\r\n\r\n\"Sure. You're probably good enough to be worth it.\" He grinned and\r\nslugged me in the shoulder. Jolu's really easy-going most of the time,\r\nwhich is why he'd freaked me out so much.\r\n\r\nI paid for the coffees and we went out. I called my parents and let\r\nthem know what I was doing. Jolu's mom insisted on making us\r\nsandwiches. We locked ourselves in his room with his computer and the\r\ncode for indienet and we embarked on one of the great all-time marathon\r\nprogramming sessions. Once Jolu's family went to bed around 11:30, we\r\nwere able to kidnap the coffee-machine up to his room and go IV with\r\nour magic coffee bean supply.\r\n\r\nIf you've never programmed a computer, you should. There's nothing like\r\nit in the whole world. When you program a computer, it does *exactly*\r\nwhat you tell it to do. It's like designing a machine -- any machine,\r\nlike a car, like a faucet, like a gas-hinge for a door -- using math\r\nand instructions. It's awesome in the truest sense: it can fill you\r\nwith awe.\r\n\r\nA computer is the most complicated machine you'll ever use. It's made\r\nof billions of micro-miniaturized transistors that can be configured to\r\nrun any program you can imagine. But when you sit down at the keyboard\r\nand write a line of code, those transistors do what you tell them to.\r\n\r\nMost of us will never build a car. Pretty much none of us will ever\r\ncreate an aviation system. Design a building. Lay out a city.\r\n\r\nThose are complicated machines, those things, and they're off-limits to\r\nthe likes of you and me. But a computer is like, ten times more\r\ncomplicated, and it will dance to any tune you play. You can learn to\r\nwrite simple code in an afternoon. Start with a language like Python,\r\nwhich was written to give non-programmers an easier way to make the\r\nmachine dance to their tune. Even if you only write code for one day,\r\none afternoon, you have to do it. Computers can control you or they can\r\nlighten your work -- if you want to be in charge of your machines, you\r\nhave to learn to write code.\r\n\r\nWe wrote a lot of code that night.\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nChapter 8\r\n\r\n[[This chapter is dedicated to Borders, the global bookselling giant\r\nthat you can find in cities all over the world -- I'll never forget\r\nwalking into the gigantic Borders on Orchard Road in Singapore and\r\ndiscovering a shelf loaded with my novels! For many years, the Borders\r\nin Oxford Street in London hosted Pat Cadigan's monthly science fiction\r\nevenings, where local and visiting authors would read their work, speak\r\nabout science fiction and meet their fans. When I'm in a strange city\r\n(which happens a lot) and I need a great book for my next flight, there\r\nalways seems to be a Borders brimming with great choices -- I'm\r\nespecially partial to the Borders on Union Square in San Francisco.]]\r\n\r\n[[Borders worldwide http://www.bordersstores.com/locator/locator.jsp]]\r\n\r\nI wasn't the only one who got screwed up by the histograms. There are\r\nlots of people who have abnormal traffic patterns, abnormal usage\r\npatterns. Abnormal is so common, it's practically normal.\r\n\r\nThe Xnet was full of these stories, and so were the newspapers and the\r\nTV news. Husbands were caught cheating on their wives; wives were\r\ncaught cheating on their husbands, kids were caught sneaking out with\r\nillicit girlfriends and boyfriends. A kid who hadn't told his parents\r\nhe had AIDS got caught going to the clinic for his drugs.\r\n\r\nThose were the people with something to hide -- not guilty people, but\r\npeople with secrets. There were even more people with nothing to hide\r\nat all, but who nevertheless resented being picked up, and questioned.\r\nImagine if someone locked you in the back of a police car and demanded\r\nthat you prove that you're *not* a terrorist.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't just public transit. Most drivers in the Bay Area have a\r\nFasTrak pass clipped to their sun-visors. This is a little radio-based\r\n\"wallet\" that pays your tolls for you when you cross the bridges,\r\nsaving you the hassle of sitting in a line for hours at the\r\ntoll-plazas. They'd tripled the cost of using cash to get across the\r\nbridge (though they always fudged this, saying that FasTrak was\r\ncheaper, not that anonymous cash was more expensive). Whatever holdouts\r\nwere left afterward disappeared after the number of cash-lanes was\r\nreduced to just one per bridge-head, so that the cash lines were even\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nSo if you're a local, or if you're driving a rental car from a local\r\nagency, you've got a FasTrak. It turns out that toll-plazas aren't the\r\nonly place that your FasTrak gets read, though. The DHS had put FasTrak\r\nreaders all over town -- when you drove past them, they logged the time\r\nand your ID number, building an ever-more perfect picture of who went\r\nwhere, when, in a database that was augmented by \"speeding cameras,\"\r\n\"red light cameras\" and all the other license-plate cameras that had\r\npopped up like mushrooms.\r\n\r\nNo one had given it much thought. And now that people were paying\r\nattention, we were all starting to notice little things, like the fact\r\nthat the FasTrak doesn't have an off-switch.\r\n\r\nSo if you drove a car, you were just as likely to be pulled over by an\r\nSFPD cruiser that wanted to know why you were taking so many trips to\r\nthe Home Depot lately, and what was that midnight drive up to Sonoma\r\nlast week about?\r\n\r\nThe little demonstrations around town on the weekend were growing.\r\nFifty thousand people marched down Market Street after a week of this\r\nmonitoring. I couldn't care less. The people who'd occupied my city\r\ndidn't care what the natives wanted. They were a conquering army. They\r\nknew how we felt about that.\r\n\r\nOne morning I came down to breakfast just in time to hear Dad tell Mom\r\nthat the two biggest taxi companies were going to give a \"discount\" to\r\npeople who used special cards to pay their fares, supposedly to make\r\ndrivers safer by reducing the amount of cash they carried. I wondered\r\nwhat would happen to the information about who took which cabs where.\r\n\r\nI realized how close I'd come. The new indienet client had been pushed\r\nout as an automatic update just as this stuff started to get bad, and\r\nJolu told me that 80 percent of the traffic he saw at Pigspleen was now\r\nencrypted. The Xnet just might have been saved.\r\n\r\nDad was driving me nuts, though.\r\n\r\n\"You're being paranoid, Marcus,\" he told me over breakfast one day as I\r\ntold him about the guys I'd seen the cops shaking down on BART the day\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\"Dad, it's ridiculous. They're not catching any terrorists, are they?\r\nIt's just making people scared.\"\r\n\r\n\"They may not have caught any terrorists yet, but they're sure getting\r\na lot of scumbags off the streets. Look at the drug dealers -- it says\r\nthey've put dozens of them away since this all started. Remember when\r\nthose druggies robbed you? If we don't bust their dealers, it'll only\r\nget worse.\" I'd been mugged the year before. They'd been pretty\r\ncivilized about it. One skinny guy who smelled bad told me he had a\r\ngun, the other one asked me for my wallet. They even let me keep my ID,\r\nthough they got my debit card and Fast Pass. It had still scared me\r\nwitless and left me paranoid and checking my shoulder for weeks.\r\n\r\n\"But most of the people they hold up aren't doing anything wrong, Dad,\"\r\nI said. This was getting to me. My own father! \"It's crazy. For every\r\nguilty person they catch, they have to punish thousands of innocent\r\npeople. That's just not good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Innocent? Guys cheating on their wives? Drug dealers? You're defending\r\nthem, but what about all the people who died? If you don't have\r\nanything to hide --\"\r\n\r\n\"So you wouldn't mind if they pulled *you* over?\" My dad's histograms\r\nhad proven to be depressingly normal so far.\r\n\r\n\"I'd consider it my duty,\" he said. \"I'd be proud. It would make me\r\nfeel safer.\"\r\n\r\nEasy for him to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVanessa didn't like me talking about this stuff, but she was too smart\r\nabout it for me to stay away from the subject for long. We'd get\r\ntogether all the time, and talk about the weather and school and stuff,\r\nand then, somehow, I'd be back on this subject. Vanessa was cool when\r\nit happened -- she didn't Hulk out on me again -- but I could see it\r\nupset her.\r\n\r\nStill.\r\n\r\n\"So my dad says, 'I'd consider it my duty.' Can you freaking *believe*\r\nit? I mean, God! I almost told him then about going to jail, asking him\r\nif he thought that was our 'duty'!\"\r\n\r\nWe were sitting in the grass in Dolores Park after school, watching the\r\ndogs chase frisbees.\r\n\r\nVan had stopped at home and changed into an old t-shirt for one of her\r\nfavorite Brazilian tecno-brega bands, Carioca Proibidão -- the\r\nforbidden guy from Rio. She'd gotten the shirt at a live show we'd all\r\ngone to two years before, sneaking out for a grand adventure down at\r\nthe Cow Palace, and she'd sprouted an inch or two since, so it was\r\ntight and rode up her tummy, showing her flat little belly button.\r\n\r\nShe lay back in the weak sun with her eyes closed behind her shades,\r\nher toes wiggling in her flip-flops. I'd known Van since forever, and\r\nwhen I thought of her, I usually saw the little kid I'd known with\r\nhundreds of jangly bracelets made out of sliced-up soda cans, who\r\nplayed the piano and couldn't dance to save her life. Sitting out there\r\nin Dolores Park, I suddenly saw her as she was.\r\n\r\nShe was totally h4wt -- that is to say, hot. It was like looking at\r\nthat picture of a vase and noticing that it was also two faces. I could\r\nsee that Van was just Van, but I could also see that she was hella\r\npretty, something I'd never noticed.\r\n\r\nOf course, Darryl had known it all along, and don't think that I wasn't\r\nbummed out anew when I realized this.\r\n\r\n\"You can't tell your dad, you know,\" she said. \"You'd put us all at\r\nrisk.\" Her eyes were closed and her chest was rising up and down with\r\nher breath, which was distracting in a really embarrassing way.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" I said, glumly. \"But the problem is that I know he's just\r\ntotally full of it. If you pulled my dad over and made him prove he\r\nwasn't a child-molesting, drug-dealing terrorist, he'd go berserk.\r\nTotally off-the-rails. He hates being put on hold when he calls about\r\nhis credit-card bill. Being locked in the back of a car and questioned\r\nfor an hour would give him an aneurism.\"\r\n\r\n\"They only get away with it because the normals feel smug compared to\r\nthe abnormals. If everyone was getting pulled over, it'd be a disaster.\r\nNo one would ever get anywhere, they'd all be waiting to get questioned\r\nby the cops. Total gridlock.\"\r\n\r\nWoah.\r\n\r\n\"Van, you are a total genius,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me about it,\" she said. She had a lazy smile and she looked at me\r\nthrough half-lidded eyes, almost romantic.\r\n\r\n\"Seriously. We can do this. We can mess up the profiles easily. Getting\r\npeople pulled over is easy.\"\r\n\r\nShe sat up and pushed her hair off her face and looked at me. I felt a\r\nlittle flip in my stomach, thinking that she was really impressed with\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"It's the arphid cloners,\" I said. \"They're totally easy to make. Just\r\nflash the firmware on a ten-dollar Radio Shack reader/writer and you're\r\ndone. What we do is go around and randomly swap the tags on people,\r\noverwriting their Fast Passes and FasTraks with other people's codes.\r\nThat'll make *everyone* skew all weird and screwy, and make everyone\r\nlook guilty. Then: total gridlock.\"\r\n\r\nVan pursed her lips and lowered her shades and I realized she was so\r\nangry she couldn't speak.\r\n\r\n\"Good bye, Marcus,\" she said, and got to her feet. Before I knew it,\r\nshe was walking away so fast she was practically running.\r\n\r\n\"Van!\" I called, getting to my feet and chasing after her. \"Van! Wait!\"\r\n\r\nShe picked up speed, making me run to catch up with her.\r\n\r\n\"Van, what the hell,\" I said, catching her arm. She jerked it away so\r\nhard I punched myself in the face.\r\n\r\n\"You're psycho, Marcus. You're going to put all your little Xnet\r\nbuddies in danger for their lives, and on top of it, you're going to\r\nturn the whole city into terrorism suspects. Can't you stop before you\r\nhurt these people?\"\r\n\r\nI opened and closed my mouth a couple times. \"Van, *I'm* not the\r\nproblem, *they* are. I'm not arresting people, jailing them, making\r\nthem disappear. The Department of Homeland Security are the ones doing\r\nthat. I'm fighting back to make them stop.\"\r\n\r\n\"How, by making it worse?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe it has to get worse to get better, Van. Isn't that what you were\r\nsaying? If everyone was getting pulled over --\"\r\n\r\n\"That's not what I meant. I didn't mean you should get everyone\r\narrested. If you want to protest, join the protest movement. Do\r\nsomething positive. Didn't you learn *anything* from Darryl?\r\n*Anything?*\"\r\n\r\n\"You're damned right I did,\" I said, losing my cool. \"I learned that\r\nthey can't be trusted. That if you're not fighting them, you're helping\r\nthem. That they'll turn the country into a prison if we let them. What\r\ndid you learn, Van? To be scared all the time, to sit tight and keep\r\nyour head down and hope you don't get noticed? You think it's going to\r\nget better? If we don't do anything, this is as *good as it's going to\r\nget*. It will only get worse and worse from now on. You want to help\r\nDarryl? Help me bring them down!\"\r\n\r\nThere it was again. My vow. Not to get Darryl free, but to bring down\r\nthe entire DHS. That was crazy, even I knew it. But it was what I\r\nplanned to do. No question about it.\r\n\r\nVan shoved me hard with both hands. She was strong from school\r\nathletics -- fencing, lacrosse, field hockey, all the girls-school\r\nsports -- and I ended up on my ass on the disgusting San Francisco\r\nsidewalk. She took off and I didn't follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> The important thing about security systems isn't how they work, it's\r\n> how they fail.\r\n\r\nThat was the first line of my first blog post on Open Revolt, my Xnet\r\nsite. I was writing as M1k3y, and I was ready to go to war.\r\n\r\n> Maybe all the automatic screening is supposed to catch terrorists.\r\n> Maybe it will catch a terrorist sooner or later. The problem is that\r\n> it catches *us* too, even though we're not doing anything wrong.\r\n\r\n> The more people it catches, the more brittle it gets. If it catches\r\n> too many people, it dies. \r\n\r\n> Get the idea?\r\n\r\nI pasted in my HOWTO for building a arphid cloner, and some tips for\r\ngetting close enough to people to read and write their tags. I put my\r\nown cloner in the pocket of my vintage black leather motocross jacket\r\nwith the armored pockets and left for school. I managed to clone six\r\ntags between home and Chavez High.\r\n\r\nIt was war they wanted. It was war they'd get.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you ever decide to do something as stupid as build an automatic\r\nterrorism detector, here's a math lesson you need to learn first. It's\r\ncalled \"the paradox of the false positive,\" and it's a doozy.\r\n\r\nSay you have a new disease, called Super-AIDS. Only one in a million\r\npeople gets Super-AIDS. You develop a test for Super-AIDS that's 99\r\npercent accurate. I mean, 99 percent of the time, it gives the correct\r\nresult -- true if the subject is infected, and false if the subject is\r\nhealthy. You give the test to a million people.\r\n\r\nOne in a million people have Super-AIDS. One in a hundred people that\r\nyou test will generate a \"false positive\" -- the test will say he has\r\nSuper-AIDS even though he doesn't. That's what \"99 percent accurate\"\r\nmeans: one percent wrong.\r\n\r\nWhat's one percent of one million?\r\n\r\n1,000,000/100 = 10,000\r\n\r\nOne in a million people has Super-AIDS. If you test a million random\r\npeople, you'll probably only find one case of real Super-AIDS. But your\r\ntest won't identify *one* person as having Super-AIDS. It will identify\r\n*10,000* people as having it.\r\n\r\nYour 99 percent accurate test will perform with 99.99 percent\r\n*inaccuracy*.\r\n\r\nThat's the paradox of the false positive. When you try to find\r\nsomething really rare, your test's accuracy has to match the rarity of\r\nthe thing you're looking for. If you're trying to point at a single\r\npixel on your screen, a sharp pencil is a good pointer: the pencil-tip\r\nis a lot smaller (more accurate) than the pixels. But a pencil-tip is\r\nno good at pointing at a single *atom* in your screen. For that, you\r\nneed a pointer -- a test -- that's one atom wide or less at the tip.\r\n\r\nThis is the paradox of the false positive, and here's how it applies to\r\nterrorism:\r\n\r\nTerrorists are really rare. In a city of twenty million like New York,\r\nthere might be one or two terrorists. Maybe ten of them at the outside.\r\n10/20,000,000 = 0.00005 percent. One twenty-thousandth of a percent.\r\n\r\nThat's pretty rare all right. Now, say you've got some software that\r\ncan sift through all the bank-records, or toll-pass records, or public\r\ntransit records, or phone-call records in the city and catch terrorists\r\n99 percent of the time.\r\n\r\nIn a pool of twenty million people, a 99 percent accurate test will\r\nidentify two hundred thousand people as being terrorists. But only ten\r\nof them are terrorists. To catch ten bad guys, you have to haul in and\r\ninvestigate two hundred thousand innocent people.\r\n\r\nGuess what? Terrorism tests aren't anywhere *close* to 99 percent\r\naccurate. More like 60 percent accurate. Even 40 percent accurate,\r\nsometimes.\r\n\r\nWhat this all meant was that the Department of Homeland Security had\r\nset itself up to fail badly. They were trying to spot incredibly rare\r\nevents -- a person is a terrorist -- with inaccurate systems.\r\n\r\nIs it any wonder we were able to make such a mess?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI stepped out the front door whistling on a Tuesday morning one week\r\ninto the Operation False Positive. I was rockin' out to some new music\r\nI'd downloaded from the Xnet the night before -- lots of people sent\r\nM1k3y little digital gifts to say thank you for giving them hope.\r\n\r\nI turned onto 23d Street and carefully took the narrow stone steps cut\r\ninto the side of the hill. As I descended, I passed Mr Wiener Dog. I\r\ndon't know Mr Wiener Dog's real name, but I see him nearly every day,\r\nwalking his three panting wiener dogs up the staircase to the little\r\nparkette. Squeezing past them all on the stairs is pretty much\r\nimpossible and I always end up tangled in a leash, knocked into\r\nsomeone's front garden, or perched on the bumper of one of the cars\r\nparked next to the curb.\r\n\r\nMr Wiener Dog is clearly Someone Important, because he has a fancy\r\nwatch and always wears a nice suit. I had mentally assumed that he\r\nworked down in the financial district.\r\n\r\nToday as I brushed up against him, I triggered my arphid cloner, which\r\nwas already loaded in the pocket of my leather jacket. The cloner\r\nsucked down the numbers off his credit-cards and his car-keys, his\r\npassport and the hundred-dollar bills in his wallet.\r\n\r\nEven as it was doing that, it was flashing some of them with new\r\nnumbers, taken from other people I'd brushed against. It was like\r\nswitching the license-plates on a bunch of cars, but invisible and\r\ninstantaneous. I smiled apologetically at Mr Wiener Dog and continued\r\ndown the stairs. I stopped at three of the cars long enough to swap\r\ntheir FasTrak tags with numbers taken off of all the cars I'd gone past\r\nthe day before.\r\n\r\nYou might think I was being a little aggro here, but I was cautious and\r\nconservative compared to a lot of the Xnetters. A couple girls in the\r\nChemical Engineering program at UC Berkeley had figured out how to make\r\na harmless substance out of kitchen products that would trip an\r\nexplosive sniffer. They'd had a merry time sprinkling it on their\r\nprofs' briefcases and jackets, then hiding out and watching the same\r\nprofs try to get into the auditoriums and libraries on campus, only to\r\nget flying-tackled by the new security squads that had sprung up\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nOther people wanted to figure out how to dust envelopes with substances\r\nthat would test positive for anthrax, but everyone else thought they\r\nwere out of their minds. Luckily, it didn't seem like they'd be able to\r\nfigure it out.\r\n\r\nI passed by San Francisco General Hospital and nodded with satisfaction\r\nas I saw the huge lines at the front doors. They had a police\r\ncheckpoint too, of course, and there were enough Xnetters working as\r\ninterns and cafeteria workers and whatnot there that everyone's badges\r\nhad been snarled up and swapped around. I'd read the security checks\r\nhad tacked an hour onto everyone's work day, and the unions were\r\nthreatening to walk out unless the hospital did something about it.\r\n\r\nA few blocks later, I saw an even longer line for the BART. Cops were\r\nwalking up and down the line pointing people out and calling them aside\r\nfor questioning, bag-searches and pat-downs. They kept getting sued for\r\ndoing this, but it didn't seem to be slowing them down.\r\n\r\nI got to school a little ahead of time and decided to walk down to 22nd\r\nStreet to get a coffee -- and I passed a police checkpoint where they\r\nwere pulling over cars for secondary inspection.\r\n\r\nSchool was no less wild -- the security guards on the metal detectors\r\nwere also wanding our school IDs and pulling out students with odd\r\nmovements for questioning. Needless to say, we all had pretty weird\r\nmovements. Needless to say, classes were starting an hour or more\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nClasses were crazy. I don't think anyone was able to concentrate. I\r\noverheard two teachers talking about how long it had taken them to get\r\nhome from work the day before, and planning to sneak out early that\r\nday.\r\n\r\nIt was all I could do to keep from laughing. The paradox of the false\r\npositive strikes again!\r\n\r\nSure enough, they let us out of class early and I headed home the long\r\nway, circling through the Mission to see the havoc. Long lines of cars.\r\nBART stations lined up around the blocks. People swearing at ATMs that\r\nwouldn't dispense their money because they'd had their accounts frozen\r\nfor suspicious activity (that's the danger of wiring your checking\r\naccount straight into your FasTrak and Fast Pass!).\r\n\r\nI got home and made myself a sandwich and logged into the Xnet. It had\r\nbeen a good day. People from all over town were crowing about their\r\nsuccesses. We'd brought the city of San Francisco to a standstill. The\r\nnews-reports confirmed it -- they were calling it the DHS gone haywire,\r\nblaming it all on the fake-ass \"security\" that was supposed to be\r\nprotecting us from terrorism. The Business section of the San Francisco\r\nChronicle gave its whole front page to an estimate of the economic cost\r\nof the DHS security resulting from missed work hours, meetings and so\r\non. According to the Chronicle's economist, a week of this crap would\r\ncost the city more than the Bay Bridge bombing had.\r\n\r\nMwa-ha-ha-ha.\r\n\r\nThe best part: Dad got home that night late. Very late. Three *hours*\r\nlate. Why? Because he'd been pulled over, searched, questioned. Then it\r\nhappened *again*. Twice.\r\n\r\nTwice!\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nChapter 9\r\n\r\n[[This chapter is dedicated to Compass Books/Books Inc, the oldest\r\nindependent bookstore in the western USA.

You know I said I'd only\r\nseen him lose his cool rarely? That night, he lost it more than he ever\r\nhad.\r\n\r\n\"You wouldn't believe it. This cop, he was like eighteen years old and\r\nhe kept saying, 'But sir, why were you in Berkeley yesterday if your\r\nclient is in Mountain View?' I kept explaining to him that I teach at\r\nBerkeley and then he'd say, 'I thought you were a consultant,' and we'd\r\nstart over again. It was like some kind of sitcom where the cops have\r\nbeen taken over by the stupidity ray.\r\n\r\n\"What's worse was he kept insisting that I'd been in Berkeley today as\r\nwell, and I kept saying no, I hadn't been, and he said I had been. Then\r\nhe showed me my FasTrak billing and it said I'd driven the San Mateo\r\nbridge three times that day!\r\n\r\n\"That's not all,\" he said, and drew in a breath that let me know he was\r\nreally steamed. \"They had information about where I'd been, places that\r\n*didn't have a toll plaza*. They'd been polling my pass just on the\r\nstreet, at random. And it was *wrong*! Holy crap, I mean, they're\r\nspying on us all and they're not even competent!\"\r\n\r\nI'd drifted down into the kitchen as he railed there, and now I was\r\nwatching him from the doorway. Mom met my eye and we both raised our\r\neyebrows as if to say, *Who's going to say 'I told you so' to him?* I\r\nnodded at her. She could use her spousular powers to nullify his rage\r\nin a way that was out of my reach as a mere filial unit.\r\n\r\n\"Drew,\" she said, and grabbed him by the arm to make him stop stalking\r\nback and forth in the kitchen, waving his arms like a street-preacher.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" he snapped.\r\n\r\n\"I think you owe Marcus an apology.\" She kept her voice even and level.\r\nDad and I are the spazzes in the household -- Mom's a total rock.\r\n\r\nDad looked at me. His eyes narrowed as he thought for a minute. \"All\r\nright,\" he said at last. \"You're right. I was talking about competent\r\nsurveillance. These guys were total amateurs. I'm sorry, son,\" he said.\r\n\"You were right. That was ridiculous.\" He stuck his hand out and shook\r\nmy hand, then gave me a firm, unexpected hug.\r\n\r\n\"God, what are we doing to this country, Marcus? Your generation\r\ndeserves to inherit something better than this.\" When he let me go, I\r\ncould see the deep wrinkles in his face, lines I'd never noticed.\r\n\r\nI went back up to my room and played some Xnet games. There was a good\r\nmultiplayer thing, a clockwork pirate game where you had to quest every\r\nday or two to wind up your whole crew's mainsprings before you could go\r\nplundering and pillaging again. It was the kind of game I hated but\r\ncouldn't stop playing: lots of repetitive quests that weren't all that\r\nsatisfying to complete, a little bit of player-versus-player combat\r\n(scrapping to see who would captain the ship) and not that many cool\r\npuzzles that you had to figure out. Mostly, playing this kind of game\r\nmade me homesick for Harajuku Fun Madness, which balanced out running\r\naround in the real world, figuring out online puzzles, and strategizing\r\nwith your team.\r\n\r\nBut today it was just what I needed. Mindless entertainment.\r\n\r\nMy poor dad.\r\n\r\nI'd done that to him. He'd been happy before, confident that his tax\r\ndollars were being spent to keep him safe. I'd destroyed that\r\nconfidence. It was false confidence, of course, but it had kept him\r\ngoing. Seeing him now, miserable and broken, I wondered if it was\r\nbetter to be clear-eyed and hopeless or to live in a fool's paradise.\r\nThat shame -- the shame I'd felt since I gave up my passwords, since\r\nthey'd broken me -- returned, leaving me listless and wanting to just\r\nget away from myself.\r\n\r\nMy character was a swabbie on the pirate ship *Zombie Charger*, and\r\nhe'd wound down while I'd been offline. I had to IM all the other\r\nplayers on my ship until I found one willing to wind me up. That kept\r\nme occupied. I liked it, actually. There was something magic about a\r\ntotal stranger doing you a favor. And since it was the Xnet, I knew\r\nthat all the strangers were friends, in some sense.\r\n\r\n> Where u located?\r\n\r\nThe character who wound me up was called Lizanator, and it was female,\r\nthough that didn't mean that it was a girl. Guys had some weird\r\naffinity for playing female characters.\r\n\r\n> San Francisco\r\n\r\nI said.\r\n\r\n> No stupe, where you located in San Fran?\r\n\r\n> Why, you a pervert?\r\n\r\nThat usually shut down that line of conversation. Of course every\r\ngamespace was full of pedos and pervs, and cops pretending to be pedo-\r\nand perv-bait (though I sure hoped there weren't any cops on the\r\nXnet!). An accusation like that was enough to change the subject nine\r\nout of ten times.\r\n\r\n> Mission? Potrero Hill? Noe? East Bay?\r\n\r\n> Just wind me up k thx?\r\n\r\nShe stopped winding.\r\n\r\n> You scared?\r\n\r\n> Safe -- why do you care?\r\n\r\n> Just curious\r\n\r\nI was getting a bad vibe off her. She was clearly more than just\r\ncurious. Call it paranoia. I logged off and shut down my Xbox.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDad looked at me over the table the next morning and said, \"It looks\r\nlike it's going to get better, at least.\" He handed me a copy of the\r\n*Chronicle* open to the third page.\r\n\r\n> A Department of Homeland Security spokesman has confirmed that the\r\n> San Francisco office has requested a 300 percent budget and personnel\r\n> increase from DC\r\n\r\nWhat?\r\n\r\n> Major General Graeme Sutherland, the commanding officer for Northern\r\n> California DHS operations, confirmed the request at a press\r\n> conference yesterday, noting that a spike in suspicious activity in\r\n> the Bay Area prompted the request. \"We are tracking a spike in\r\n> underground chatter and activity and believe that saboteurs are\r\n> deliberately manufacturing false security alerts to undermine our\r\n> efforts.\"\r\n\r\nMy eyes crossed. No freaking way.\r\n\r\n> \"These false alarms are potentially 'radar chaff' intended to\r\n> disguise real attacks. The only effective way of combatting them is\r\n> to step up staffing and analyst levels so that we can fully\r\n> investigate every lead.\"\r\n\r\n> Sutherland noted the delays experienced all over the city were\r\n> \"unfortunate\" and committed to eliminating them.\r\n\r\nI had a vision of the city with four or five times as many DHS\r\nenforcers, brought in to make up for my own stupid ideas. Van was\r\nright. The more I fought them, the worse it was going to get.\r\n\r\nDad pointed at the paper. \"These guys may be fools, but they're\r\nmethodical fools. They'll just keep throwing resources at this problem\r\nuntil they solve it. It's tractable, you know. Mining all the data in\r\nthe city, following up on every lead. They'll catch the terrorists.\"\r\n\r\nI lost it. \"Dad! Are you *listening to yourself*? They're talking about\r\ninvestigating practically every person in the city of San Francisco!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" he said, \"that's right. They'll catch every alimony cheat,\r\nevery dope dealer, every dirt-bag and every terrorist. You just wait.\r\nThis could be the best thing that ever happened to this country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me you're joking,\" I said. \"I beg you. You think that that's what\r\nthey intended when they wrote the Constitution? What about the Bill of\r\nRights?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Bill of Rights was written before data-mining,\" he said. He was\r\nawesomely serene, convinced of his rightness. \"The right to freedom of\r\nassociation is fine, but why shouldn't the cops be allowed to mine your\r\nsocial network to figure out if you're hanging out with gangbangers and\r\nterrorists?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it's an invasion of my privacy!\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"What's the big deal? Would you rather have privacy or terrorists?\"\r\n\r\nAgh. I hated arguing with my dad like this. I needed a coffee. \"Dad,\r\ncome on. Taking away our privacy isn't catching terrorists: it's just\r\ninconveniencing normal people.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know it's not catching terrorists?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are the terrorists they've caught?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure we'll see arrests in good time. You just wait.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dad, what the hell has happened to you since last night? You were\r\nready to go nuclear on the cops for pulling you over --\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't use that tone with me, Marcus. What's happened since last night\r\nis that I've had the chance to think it over and to read *this*.\" He\r\nrattled his paper. \"The reason they caught me is that the bad guys are\r\nactively jamming them. They need to adjust their techniques to overcome\r\nthe jamming. But they'll get there. Meanwhile the occasional road stop\r\nis a small price to pay. This isn't the time to be playing lawyer about\r\nthe Bill of Rights. This is the time to make some sacrifices to keep\r\nour city safe.\"\r\n\r\nI couldn't finish my toast. I put the plate in the dishwasher and left\r\nfor school. I had to get out of there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Xnetters weren't happy about the stepped up police surveillance,\r\nbut they weren't going to take it lying down. Someone called a phone-in\r\nshow on KQED and told them that the police were wasting their time,\r\nthat we could monkeywrench the system faster than they could untangle\r\nit. The recording was a top Xnet download that night.\r\n\r\n\"This is California Live and we're talking to an anonymous caller at a\r\npayphone in San Francisco. He has his own information about the\r\nslowdowns we've been facing around town this week. Caller, you're on\r\nthe air.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, yo, this is just the beginning, you know? I mean, like, we're\r\njust getting started. Let them hire a billion pigs and put a checkpoint\r\non every corner. We'll jam them all! And like, all this crap about\r\nterrorists? We're not terrorists! Give me a break, I mean, really!\r\nWe're jamming up the system because we hate the Homeland Security, and\r\nbecause we love our city. Terrorists? I can't even spell jihad. Peace\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nHe sounded like an idiot. Not just the incoherent words, but also his\r\ngloating tone. He sounded like a kid who was indecently proud of\r\nhimself. He *was* a kid who was indecently proud of himself.\r\n\r\nThe Xnet flamed out over this. Lots of people thought he was an idiot\r\nfor calling in, while others thought he was a hero. I worried that\r\nthere was probably a camera aimed at the payphone he'd used. Or an\r\narphid reader that might have sniffed his Fast Pass. I hoped he'd had\r\nthe smarts to wipe his fingerprints off the quarter, keep his hood up,\r\nand leave all his arphids at home. But I doubted it. I wondered if he'd\r\nget a knock on the door sometime soon.\r\n\r\nThe way I knew when something big had happened on Xnet was that I'd\r\nsuddenly get a million emails from people who wanted M1k3y to know\r\nabout the latest haps. It was just as I was reading about Mr\r\nCan't-Spell-Jihad that my mailbox went crazy. Everyone had a message\r\nfor me -- a link to a livejournal on the Xnet -- one of the many\r\nanonymous blogs that were based on the Freenet document publishing\r\nsystem that was also used by Chinese democracy advocates.\r\n\r\n> Close call\r\n\r\n> We were jamming at the Embarcadero tonite and goofing around giving\r\n> everyone a new car key or door key or Fast Pass or FasTrak, tossing\r\n> around a little fake gunpowder. There were cops everywhere but we\r\n> were smarter than them; we're there pretty much every night and we\r\n> never get caught.\r\n\r\n> So we got caught tonight. It was a stupid mistake we got sloppy we\r\n> got busted. It was an undercover who caught my pal and then got the\r\n> rest of us. They'd been watching the crowd for a long time and they\r\n> had one of those trucks nearby and they took four of us in but missed\r\n> the rest.\r\n\r\n> The truck was JAMMED like a can of sardines with every kind of\r\n> person, old young black white rich poor all suspects, and there were\r\n> two cops trying to ask us questions and the undercovers kept bringing\r\n> in more of us. Most people were trying to get to the front of the\r\n> line to get through questioning so we kept on moving back and it was\r\n> like hours in there and really hot and it was getting more crowded\r\n> not less.\r\n\r\n> At like 8PM they changed shifts and two new cops came in and bawled\r\n> out the two cops who were there all like wtf? aren't you doing\r\n> anything here. They had a real fight and then the two old cops left\r\n> and the new cops sat down at their desks and whispered to each other\r\n> for a while.\r\n\r\n> Then one cop stood up and started shouting EVERYONE JUST GO HOME\r\n> JESUS CHRIST WE'VE GOT BETTER THINGS TO DO THAN BOTHER YOU WITH MORE\r\n> QUESTIONS IF YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING WRONG JUST DON'T DO IT AGAIN AND\r\n> LET THIS BE A WARNING TO YOU ALL.\r\n\r\n> A bunch of the suits got really pissed which was HILARIOUS because I\r\n> mean ten minutes before they were buggin about being held there and\r\n> now they were wicked pissed about being let go, like make up your\r\n> minds!\r\n\r\n> We split fast though and got out and came home to write this. There\r\n> are undercovers everywhere, believe. If you're jamming, be open-eyed\r\n> and get ready to run when problems happen. If you get caught try to\r\n> wait it out they're so busy they'll maybe just let you go. \r\n\r\n> We made them that busy! All those people in that truck were there\r\n> because we'd jammed them. So jam on! \r\n\r\nI felt like I was going to throw up. Those four people -- kids I'd\r\nnever met -- they nearly went away forever because of something I'd\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\nBecause of something I'd told them to do. I was no better than a\r\nterrorist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe DHS got their budget requisition approved. The President went on TV\r\nwith the Governor to tell us that no price was too high for security.\r\nWe had to watch it the next day in school at assembly. My Dad cheered.\r\nHe'd hated the President since the day he was elected, saying he wasn't\r\nany better than the last guy and the last guy had been a complete\r\ndisaster, but now all he could do was talk about how decisive and\r\ndynamic the new guy was.\r\n\r\n\"You have to take it easy on your father,\" Mom said to me one night\r\nafter I got home from school. She'd been working from home as much as\r\npossible. Mom's a freelance relocation specialist who helps British\r\npeople get settled in in San Francisco. The UK High Commission pays her\r\nto answer emails from mystified British people across the country who\r\nare totally confused by how freaky we Americans are. She explains\r\nAmericans for a living, and she said that these days it was better to\r\ndo that from home, where she didn't have to actually see any Americans\r\nor talk to them.\r\n\r\nI don't have any illusions about Britain. America may be willing to\r\ntrash its Constitution every time some Jihadist looks cross-eyed at us,\r\nbut as I learned in my ninth-grade Social Studies independent project,\r\nthe Brits don't even *have* a Constitution. They've got laws there that\r\nwould curl the hair on your toes: they can put you in jail for an\r\nentire year if they're really sure that you're a terrorist but don't\r\nhave enough evidence to prove it. Now, how sure can they be if they\r\ndon't have enough evidence to prove it? How'd they get that sure? Did\r\nthey see you committing terrorist acts in a really vivid dream?\r\n\r\nAnd the surveillance in Britain makes America look like amateur hour.\r\nThe average Londoner is photographed 500 times a day, just walking\r\naround the streets. Every license plate is photographed at every corner\r\nin the country. Everyone from the banks to the public transit company\r\nis enthusiastic about tracking you and snitching on you if they think\r\nyou're remotely suspicious.\r\n\r\nBut Mom didn't see it that way. She'd left Britain halfway through high\r\nschool and she'd never felt at home here, no matter that she'd married\r\na boy from Petaluma and raised a son here. To her, this was always the\r\nland of barbarians, and Britain would always be home.\r\n\r\n\"Mom, he's just wrong. You of all people should know that. Everything\r\nthat makes this country great is being flushed down the toilet and he's\r\ngoing along with it. Have you noticed that they haven't *caught any\r\nterrorists*? Dad's all like, 'We need to be safe,' but he needs to know\r\nthat most of us don't feel safe. We feel endangered all the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know this all, Marcus. Believe me, I'm not fan of what's been\r\nhappening to this country. But your father is --\" She broke off. \"When\r\nyou didn't come home after the attacks, he thought --\"\r\n\r\nShe got up and made herself a cup of tea, something she did whenever\r\nshe was uncomfortable or disconcerted.\r\n\r\n\"Marcus,\" she said. \"Marcus, we thought you were dead. Do you\r\nunderstand that? We were mourning you for days. We were imagining you\r\nblown to bits, at the bottom of the ocean. Dead because some bastard\r\ndecided to kill hundreds of strangers to make some point.\"\r\n\r\nThat sank in slowly. I mean, I understood that they'd been worried.\r\nLots of people died in the bombings -- four thousand was the present\r\nestimate -- and practically everyone knew someone who didn't come home\r\nthat day. There were two people from my school who had disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"Your father was ready to kill someone. Anyone. He was out of his mind.\r\nYou've never seen him like this. I've never seen him like it either. He\r\nwas out of his mind. He'd just sit at this table and curse and curse\r\nand curse. Vile words, words I'd never heard him say. One day -- the\r\nthird day -- someone called and he was sure it was you, but it was a\r\nwrong number and he threw the phone so hard it disintegrated into\r\nthousands of pieces.\" I'd wondered about the new kitchen phone.\r\n\r\n\"Something broke in your father. He loves you. We both love you. You\r\nare the most important thing in our lives. I don't think you realize\r\nthat. Do you remember when you were ten, when I went home to London for\r\nall that time? Do you remember?\"\r\n\r\nI nodded silently.\r\n\r\n\"We were ready to get a divorce, Marcus. Oh, it doesn't matter why\r\nanymore. It was just a bad patch, the kind of thing that happens when\r\npeople who love each other stop paying attention for a few years. He\r\ncame and got me and convinced me to come back for you. We couldn't bear\r\nthe thought of doing that to you. We fell in love again for you. We're\r\ntogether today because of you.\"\r\n\r\nI had a lump in my throat. I'd never known this. No one had ever told\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"So your father is having a hard time right now. He's not in his right\r\nmind. It's going to take some time before he comes back to us, before\r\nhe's the man I love again. We need to understand him until then.\"\r\n\r\nShe gave me a long hug, and I noticed how thin her arms had gotten, how\r\nsaggy the skin on her neck was. I always thought of my mother as young,\r\npale, rosy-cheeked and cheerful, peering shrewdly through her metal-rim\r\nglasses. Now she looked a little like an old woman. I had done that to\r\nher. The terrorists had done that to her. The Department of Homeland\r\nSecurity had done that to her. In a weird way, we were all on the same\r\nside, and Mom and Dad and all those people we'd spoofed were on the\r\nother side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI couldn't sleep that night. Mom's words kept running through my head.\r\nDad had been tense and quiet at dinner and we'd barely spoken, because\r\nI didn't trust myself not to say the wrong thing and because he was all\r\nwound up over the latest news, that Al Qaeda was definitely responsible\r\nfor the bombing. Six different terrorist groups had claimed\r\nresponsibility for the attack, but only Al Qaeda's Internet video\r\ndisclosed information that the DHS said they hadn't disclosed to\r\nanyone.\r\n\r\nI lay in bed and listened to a late-night call-in radio show. The topic\r\nwas sex problems, with this gay guy who I normally loved to listen to,\r\nhe would give people such raw advice, but good advice, and he was\r\nreally funny and campy.\r\n\r\nTonight I couldn't laugh. Most of the callers wanted to ask what to do\r\nabout the fact that they were having a hard time getting busy with\r\ntheir partners ever since the attack. Even on sex-talk radio, I\r\ncouldn't get away from the topic.\r\n\r\nI switched the radio off and heard a purring engine on the street\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nMy bedroom is in the top floor of our house, one of the painted ladies.\r\nI have a sloping attic ceiling and windows on both sides -- one\r\noverlooks the whole Mission, the other looks out into the street in\r\nfront of our place. There were often cars cruising at all hours of the\r\nnight, but there was something different about this engine noise.\r\n\r\nI went to the street-window and pulled up my blinds. Down on the street\r\nbelow me was a white, unmarked van whose roof was festooned with radio\r\nantennas, more antennas than I'd ever seen on a car. It was cruising\r\nvery slowly down the street, a little dish on top spinning around and\r\naround.\r\n\r\nAs I watched, the van stopped and one of the back doors popped open. A\r\nguy in a DHS uniform -- I could spot one from a hundred yards now --\r\nstepped out into the street. He had some kind of handheld device, and\r\nits blue glow lit his face. He paced back and forth, first scouting my\r\nneighbors, making notes on his device, then heading for me. There was\r\nsomething familiar in the way he walked, looking down --\r\n\r\nHe was using a wifinder! The DHS was scouting for Xnet nodes. I let go\r\nof the blinds and dove across my room for my Xbox. I'd left it up while\r\nI downloaded some cool animations one of the Xnetters had made of the\r\nPresident's no-price-too-high speech. I yanked the plug out of the\r\nwall, then scurried back to the window and cracked the blind a fraction\r\nof an inch.\r\n\r\nThe guy was looking down into his wifinder again, walking back and\r\nforth in front of our house. A moment later, he got back into his van\r\nand drove away.\r\n\r\nI got out my camera and took as many pictures as I could of the van and\r\nits antennas. Then I opened them in a free image-editor called The GIMP\r\nand edited out everything from the photo except the van, erasing my\r\nstreet and anything that might identify me.\r\n\r\nI posted them to Xnet and wrote down everything I could about the vans.\r\nThese guys were definitely looking for the Xnet, I could tell.\r\n\r\nNow I really couldn't sleep.\r\n\r\nNothing for it but to play wind-up pirates. There'd be lots of players\r\neven at this hour. The real name for wind-up pirates was Clockwork\r\nPlunder, and it was a hobbyist project that had been created by\r\nteenaged death-metal freaks from Finland. It was totally free to play,\r\nand offered just as much fun as any of the $15/month services like\r\nEnder's Universe and Middle Earth Quest and Discworld Dungeons.\r\n\r\nI logged back in and there I was, still on the deck of the Zombie\r\nCharger, waiting for someone to wind me up. I hated this part of the\r\ngame.\r\n\r\n> Hey you\r\n\r\nI typed to a passing pirate.\r\n\r\n> Wind me up?\r\n\r\nHe paused and looked at me.\r\n\r\n> y should i?\r\n\r\n> We're on the same team. Plus you get experience points.\r\n\r\nWhat a jerk.\r\n\r\n> Where are you located?\r\n\r\n> San Francisco\r\n\r\nThis was starting to feel familiar.\r\n\r\n> Where in San Francisco?\r\n\r\nI logged out. There was something weird going on in the game. I jumped\r\nonto the livejournals and began to crawl from blog to blog. I got\r\nthrough half a dozen before I found something that froze my blood.\r\n\r\nLivejournallers love quizzes. What kind of hobbit are you? Are you a\r\ngreat lover? What planet are you most like? Which character from some\r\nmovie are you? What's your emotional type? They fill them in and their\r\nfriends fill them in and everyone compares their results. Harmless fun.\r\n\r\nBut the quiz that had taken over the blogs of the Xnet that night was\r\nwhat scared me, because it was anything but harmless:\r\n\r\n* What's your sex\r\n\r\n* What grade are you in?\r\n\r\n* What school do you go to?\r\n\r\n* Where in the city do you live?\r\n\r\nThe quizzes plotted the results on a map with colored pushpins for\r\nschools and neighborhoods, and made lame recommendations for places to\r\nbuy pizza and stuff.\r\n\r\nBut look at those questions. Think about my answers:\r\n\r\n* Male\r\n\r\n* 12\r\n\r\n* Chavez High\r\n\r\n* Potrero Hill\r\n\r\nThere were only two people in my whole school who matched that profile.\r\nMost schools it would be the same. If you wanted to figure out who the\r\nXnetters were, you could use these quizzes to find them all.\r\n\r\nThat was bad enough, but what was worse was what it implied: someone\r\nfrom the DHS was using the Xnet to get at us. The Xnet was compromised\r\nby the DHS.\r\n\r\nWe had spies in our midst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd given Xnet discs to hundreds of people, and they'd done the same. I\r\nknew the people I gave the discs to pretty well. Some of them I knew\r\nvery well. I've lived in the same house all my life and I've made\r\nhundreds and hundreds of friends over the years, from people who went\r\nto daycare with me to people I played soccer with, people who LARPed\r\nwith me, people I met clubbing, people I knew from school. My ARG team\r\nwere my closest friends, but there were plenty of people I knew and\r\ntrusted enough to hand an Xnet disc to.\r\n\r\nI needed them now.\r\n\r\nI woke Jolu up by ringing his cell phone and hanging up after the first\r\nring, three times in a row. A minute later, he was up on Xnet and we\r\nwere able to have a secure chat. I pointed him to my blog-post on the\r\nradio vans and he came back a minute later all freaked out.\r\n\r\n> You sure they're looking for us?\r\n\r\nIn response I sent him to the quiz.\r\n\r\n> OMG we're doomed\r\n\r\n> No it's not that bad but we need to figure out who we can trust\r\n\r\n> How?\r\n\r\n> That's what I wanted to ask you -- how many people can you totally\r\n> vouch for like trust them to the ends of the earth?\r\n\r\n> Um 20 or 30 or so\r\n\r\n> I want to get a bunch of really trustworthy people together and do a\r\n> key-exchange web of trust thing\r\n\r\nWeb of trust is one of those cool crypto things that I'd read about but\r\nnever tried. It was a nearly foolproof way to make sure that you could\r\ntalk to the people you trusted, but that no one else could listen in.\r\nThe problem is that it requires you to physically meet with the people\r\nin the web at least once, just to get started.\r\n\r\n> I get it sure. That's not bad. But how you going to get everyone\r\n> together for the key-signing?\r\n\r\n> That's what I wanted to ask you about -- how can we do it without\r\n> getting busted?\r\n\r\nJolu typed some words and erased them, typed more and erased them.\r\n\r\n> Darryl would know\r\n\r\nI typed.\r\n\r\n> God, this was the stuff he was great at.\r\n\r\nJolu didn't type anything. Then,\r\n\r\n> How about a party?\r\n\r\nhe typed.\r\n\r\n> How about if we all get together somewhere like we're teenagers\r\n> having a party and that way we'll have a ready-made excuse if anyone\r\n> shows up asking us what we're doing there?\r\n\r\n> That would totally work! You're a genius, Jolu.\r\n\r\n> I know it. And you're going to love this: I know just where to do it,\r\n> too\r\n\r\n> Where?\r\n\r\n> Sutro baths!\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nChapter 10\r\n\r\n[[This chapter is dedicated to Anderson's Bookshops, Chicago's\r\nlegendary kids' bookstore.

You\r\ncould denounce him, put him up against the wall and take him out. But\r\nthen you might end up with another spy in your midst, and the new spy\r\nwould be more careful than the last one and maybe not get caught quite\r\nso readily.\r\n\r\nHere's a better idea: start intercepting the spy's communications and\r\nfeed him and his masters misinformation. Say his masters instruct him\r\nto gather information on your movements. Let him follow you around and\r\ntake all the notes he wants, but steam open the envelopes that he sends\r\nback to HQ and replace his account of your movements with a fictitious\r\none. If you want, you can make him seem erratic and unreliable so they\r\nget rid of him. You can manufacture crises that might make one side or\r\nthe other reveal the identities of other spies. In short, you own them.\r\n\r\nThis is called the man-in-the-middle attack and if you think about it,\r\nit's pretty scary. Someone who man-in-the-middles your communications\r\ncan trick you in any of a thousand ways.\r\n\r\nOf course, there's a great way to get around the man-in-the-middle\r\nattack: use crypto. With crypto, it doesn't matter if the enemy can see\r\nyour messages, because he can't decipher them, change them, and re-send\r\nthem. That's one of the main reasons to use crypto.\r\n\r\nBut remember: for crypto to work, you need to have keys for the people\r\nyou want to talk to. You and your partner need to share a secret or\r\ntwo, some keys that you can use to encrypt and decrypt your messages so\r\nthat men-in-the-middle get locked out.\r\n\r\nThat's where the idea of public keys comes in. This is a little hairy,\r\nbut it's so unbelievably elegant too.\r\n\r\nIn public key crypto, each user gets two keys. They're long strings of\r\nmathematical gibberish, and they have an almost magic property.\r\nWhatever you scramble with one key, the other will unlock, and\r\nvice-versa. What's more, they're the *only* keys that can do this -- if\r\nyou can unscramble a message with one key, you *know* it was scrambled\r\nwith the other (and vice-versa).\r\n\r\nSo you take either one of these keys (it doesn't matter which one) and\r\nyou just *publish* it. You make it a total *non-secret*. You want\r\nanyone in the world to know what it is. For obvious reasons, they call\r\nthis your \"public key.\"\r\n\r\nThe other key, you hide in the darkest reaches of your mind. You\r\nprotect it with your life. You never let anyone ever know what it is.\r\nThat's called your \"private key.\" (Duh.)\r\n\r\nNow say you're a spy and you want to talk with your bosses. Their\r\npublic key is known by everyone. Your public key is known by everyone.\r\nNo one knows your private key but you. No one knows their private key\r\nbut them.\r\n\r\nYou want to send them a message. First, you encrypt it with your\r\nprivate key. You could just send that message along, and it would work\r\npretty well, since they would know when the message arrived that it\r\ncame from you. How? Because if they can decrypt it with your public\r\nkey, it can *only* have been encrypted with your private key. This is\r\nthe equivalent of putting your seal or signature on the bottom of a\r\nmessage. It says, \"I wrote this, and no one else. No one could have\r\ntampered with it or changed it.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this won't actually keep your message a *secret*. That's\r\nbecause your public key is really well known (it has to be, or you'll\r\nbe limited to sending messages to those few people who have your public\r\nkey). Anyone who intercepts the message can read it. They can't change\r\nit and make it seem like it came from you, but if you don't want people\r\nto know what you're saying, you need a better solution.\r\n\r\nSo instead of just encrypting the message with your private key, you\r\n*also* encrypt it with your boss's public key. Now it's been locked\r\ntwice. The first lock -- the boss's public key -- only comes off when\r\ncombined with your boss's private key. The second lock -- your private\r\nkey -- only comes off with your public key. When your bosses receive\r\nthe message, they unlock it with both keys and now they know for sure\r\nthat: a) you wrote it and b) that only they can read it.\r\n\r\nIt's very cool. The day I discovered it, Darryl and I immediately\r\nexchanged keys and spent months cackling and rubbing our hands as we\r\nexchanged our military-grade secret messages about where to meet after\r\nschool and whether Van would ever notice him.\r\n\r\nBut if you want to understand security, you need to consider the most\r\nparanoid possibilities. Like, what if I tricked you into thinking that\r\n*my* public key was your boss's public key? You'd encrypt the message\r\nwith your private key and my public key. I'd decrypt it, read it,\r\nre-encrypt it with your boss's *real* public key and send it on. As far\r\nas your boss knows, no one but you could have written the message and\r\nno one but him could have read it.\r\n\r\nAnd I get to sit in the middle, like a fat spider in a web, and all\r\nyour secrets belong to me.\r\n\r\nNow, the easiest way to fix this is to really widely advertise your\r\npublic key. If it's *really* easy for anyone to know what your real key\r\nis, man-in-the-middle gets harder and harder. But you know what? Making\r\nthings well-known is just as hard as keeping them secret. Think about\r\nit -- how many billions of dollars are spent on shampoo ads and other\r\ncrap, just to make sure that as many people know about something that\r\nsome advertiser wants them to know?\r\n\r\nThere's a cheaper way of fixing man-in-the-middle: the web of trust.\r\nSay that before you leave HQ, you and your bosses sit down over coffee\r\nand actually tell each other your keys. No more man-in-the-middle!\r\nYou're absolutely certain whose keys you have, because they were put\r\ninto your own hands.\r\n\r\nSo far, so good. But there's a natural limit to this: how many people\r\ncan you physically meet with and swap keys? How many hours in the day\r\ndo you want to devote to the equivalent of writing your own phone book?\r\nHow many of those people are willing to devote that kind of time to\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nThinking about this like a phonebook helps. The world was once a place\r\nwith a lot of phonebooks, and when you needed a number, you could look\r\nit up in the book. But for many of the numbers that you wanted to refer\r\nto on a given day, you would either know it by heart, or you'd be able\r\nto ask someone else. Even today, when I'm out with my cell-phone, I'll\r\nask Jolu or Darryl if they have a number I'm looking for. It's faster\r\nand easier than looking it up online and they're more reliable, too. If\r\nJolu has a number, I trust him, so I trust the number, too. That's\r\ncalled \"transitive trust\" -- trust that moves across the web of our\r\nrelationships.\r\n\r\nA web of trust is a bigger version of this. Say I meet Jolu and get his\r\nkey. I can put it on my \"keyring\" -- a list of keys that I've signed\r\nwith my private key. That means you can unlock it with my public key\r\nand know for sure that me -- or someone with my key, anyway -- says\r\nthat \"this key belongs to this guy.\"\r\n\r\nSo I hand you my keyring and provided that you trust me to have\r\nactually met and verified all the keys on it, you can take it and add\r\nit to your keyring. Now, you meet someone else and you hand the whole\r\nring to him. Bigger and bigger the ring grows, and provided that you\r\ntrust the next guy in the chain, and he trusts the next guy in his\r\nchain and so on, you're pretty secure.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to keysigning parties. These are *exactly* what they\r\nsound like: a party where everyone gets together and signs everyone\r\nelse's keys. Darryl and I, when we traded keys, that was kind of a\r\nmini-keysigning party, one with only two sad and geeky attendees. But\r\nwith more people, you create the seed of the web of trust, and the web\r\ncan expand from there. As everyone on your keyring goes out into the\r\nworld and meets more people, they can add more and more names to the\r\nring. You don't have to meet the new people, just trust that the signed\r\nkey you get from the people in your web is valid.\r\n\r\nSo that's why web of trust and parties go together like peanut butter\r\nand chocolate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Just tell them it's a super-private party, invitational only,\" I said.\r\n\"Tell them not to bring anyone along or they won't be admitted.\"\r\n\r\nJolu looked at me over his coffee. \"You're joking, right? You tell\r\npeople that, and they'll bring *extra* friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Argh,\" I said. I spent a night a week at Jolu's these days, keeping\r\nthe code up to date on indienet. Pigspleen actually paid me a non-zero\r\nsum of money to do this, which was really weird. I never thought I'd be\r\npaid to write code.\r\n\r\n\"So what do we do? We only want people we really trust there, and we\r\ndon't want to mention why until we've got everyone's keys and can send\r\nthem messages in secret.\"\r\n\r\nJolu debugged and I watched over his shoulder. This used to be called\r\n\"extreme programming,\" which was a little embarrassing. Now we just\r\ncall it \"programming.\" Two people are much better at spotting bugs than\r\none. As the cliche goes, \"With enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.\"\r\n\r\nWe were working our way through the bug reports and getting ready to\r\npush out the new rev. It all auto-updated in the background, so our\r\nusers didn't really need to do anything, they just woke up once a week\r\nor so with a better program. It was pretty freaky to know that the code\r\nI wrote would be used by hundreds of thousands of people, *tomorrow*!\r\n\r\n\"What do we do? Man, I don't know. I think we just have to live with\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nI thought back to our Harajuku Fun Madness days. There were lots of\r\nsocial challenges involving large groups of people as part of that\r\ngame.\r\n\r\n\"OK, you're right. But let's at least try to keep this secret. Tell\r\nthem that they can bring a maximum of one person, and it has to be\r\nsomeone they've known personally for a minimum of five years.\"\r\n\r\nJolu looked up from the screen. \"Hey,\" he said. \"Hey, that would\r\ntotally work. I can really see it. I mean, if you told me not to bring\r\nanyone, I'd be all, 'Who the hell does he think he is?' But when you\r\nput it that way, it sounds like some awesome 007 stuff.\"\r\n\r\nI found a bug. We drank some coffee. I went home and played a little\r\nClockwork Plunder, trying not to think about key-winders with nosy\r\nquestions, and slept like a baby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSutro baths are San Francisco's authentic fake Roman ruins. When it\r\nopened in 1896, it was the largest indoor bathing house in the world, a\r\nhuge Victorian glass solarium filled with pools and tubs and even an\r\nearly water slide. It went downhill by the fifties, and the owners\r\ntorched it for the insurance in 1966. All that's left is a labyrinth of\r\nweathered stone set into the sere cliff-face at Ocean Beach. It looks\r\nfor all the world like a Roman ruin, crumbled and mysterious, and just\r\nbeyond them is a set of caves that let out into the sea. In rough\r\ntides, the waves rush through the caves and over the ruins -- they've\r\neven been known to suck in and drown the occasional tourist.\r\n\r\nOcean Beach is way out past Golden Gate park, a stark cliff lined with\r\nexpensive, doomed houses, plunging down to a narrow beach studded with\r\njellyfish and brave (insane) surfers. There's a giant white rock that\r\njuts out of the shallows off the shore. That's called Seal Rock, and it\r\nused to be the place where the sea lions congregated until they were\r\nrelocated to the more tourist-friendly environs of Fisherman's Wharf.\r\n\r\nAfter dark, there's hardly anyone out there. It gets very cold, with a\r\nsalt spray that'll soak you to your bones if you let it. The rocks are\r\nsharp and there's broken glass and the occasional junkie needle.\r\n\r\nIt is an awesome place for a party.\r\n\r\nBringing along the tarpaulins and chemical glove-warmers was my idea.\r\nJolu figured out where to get the beer -- his older brother, Javier,\r\nhad a buddy who actually operated a whole underage drinking service:\r\npay him enough and he'd back up to your secluded party spot with\r\nice-chests and as many brews as you wanted. I blew a bunch of my\r\nindienet programming money, and the guy showed up right on time: 8PM, a\r\ngood hour after sunset, and lugged the six foam ice-chests out of his\r\npickup truck and down into the ruins of the baths. He even brought a\r\nspare chest for the empties.\r\n\r\n\"You kids play safe now,\" he said, tipping his cowboy hat. He was a fat\r\nSamoan guy with a huge smile, and a scary tank-top that you could see\r\nhis armpit- and belly- and shoulder-hair escaping from. I peeled\r\ntwenties off my roll and handed them to him -- his markup was 150\r\npercent. Not a bad racket.\r\n\r\nHe looked at my roll. \"You know, I could just take that from you,\" he\r\nsaid, still smiling. \"I'm a criminal, after all.\"\r\n\r\nI put my roll in my pocket and looked him levelly in the eye. I'd been\r\nstupid to show him what I was carrying, but I knew that there were\r\ntimes when you should just stand your ground.\r\n\r\n\"I'm just messing with you,\" he said, at last. \"But you be careful with\r\nthat money. Don't go showing it around.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" I said. \"Homeland Security'll get my back though.\"\r\n\r\nHis smile got even bigger. \"Ha! They're not even real five-oh. Those\r\npeckerwoods don't know nothin'.\"\r\n\r\nI looked over at his truck. Prominently displayed in his windscreen was\r\na FasTrak. I wondered how long it would be until he got busted.\r\n\r\n\"You got girls coming tonight? That why you got all the beer?\"\r\n\r\nI smiled and waved at him as though he was walking back to his truck,\r\nwhich he should have been doing. He eventually got the hint and drove\r\naway. His smile never faltered.\r\n\r\nJolu helped me hide the coolers in the rubble, working with little\r\nwhite LED torches on headbands. Once the coolers were in place, we\r\nthrew little white LED keychains into each one, so it would glow when\r\nyou took the styrofoam lids off, making it easier to see what you were\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nIt was a moonless night and overcast, and the distant streetlights\r\nbarely illuminated us. I knew we'd stand out like blazes on an infrared\r\nscope, but there was no chance that we'd be able to get a bunch of\r\npeople together without being observed. I'd settle for being dismissed\r\nas a little drunken beach-party.\r\n\r\nI don't really drink much. There's been beer and pot and ecstasy at the\r\nparties I've been going to since I was 14, but I hated smoking (though\r\nI'm quite partial to a hash brownie every now and again), ecstasy took\r\ntoo long -- who's got a whole weekend to get high and come down -- and\r\nbeer, well, it was all right, but I didn't see what the big deal was.\r\nMy favorite was big, elaborate cocktails, the kind of thing served in a\r\nceramic volcano, with six layers, on fire, and a plastic monkey on the\r\nrim, but that was mostly for the theater of it all.\r\n\r\nI actually like being drunk. I just don't like being hungover, and boy,\r\ndo I ever get hungover. Though again, that might have to do with the\r\nkind of drinks that come in a ceramic volcano.\r\n\r\nBut you can't throw a party without putting a case or two of beer on\r\nice. It's expected. It loosens things up. People do stupid things after\r\ntoo many beers, but it's not like my friends are the kind of people who\r\nhave cars. And people do stupid things no matter what -- beer or grass\r\nor whatever are all incidental to that central fact.\r\n\r\nJolu and I each cracked beers -- Anchor Steam for him, a Bud Lite for\r\nme -- and clinked the bottles together, sitting down on a rock.\r\n\r\n\"You told them 9PM?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Me too.\"\r\n\r\nWe drank in silence. The Bud Lite was the least alcoholic thing in the\r\nice-chest. I'd need a clear head later.\r\n\r\n\"You ever get scared?\" I said, finally.\r\n\r\nHe turned to me. \"No man, I don't get scared. I'm always scared. I've\r\nbeen scared since the minute the explosions happened. I'm so scared\r\nsometimes, I don't want to get out of bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why do you do it?\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled. \"About that,\" he said. \"Maybe I won't, not for much longer.\r\nI mean, it's been great helping you. Great. Really excellent. I don't\r\nknow when I've done anything so important. But Marcus, bro, I have to\r\nsay. . .\" He trailed off.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" I said, though I knew what was coming next.\r\n\r\n\"I can't do it forever,\" he said at last. \"Maybe not even for another\r\nmonth. I think I'm through. It's too much risk. The DHS, you can't go\r\nto war on them. It's crazy. Really actually crazy.\"\r\n\r\n\"You sound like Van,\" I said. My voice was much more bitter than I'd\r\nintended.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not criticizing you, man. I think it's great that you've got the\r\nbravery to do this all the time. But I haven't got it. I can't live my\r\nlife in perpetual terror.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you saying?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm saying I'm out. I'm going to be one of those people who acts like\r\nit's all OK, like it'll all go back to normal some day. I'm going to\r\nuse the Internet like I always did, and only use the Xnet to play\r\ngames. I'm going to get out is what I'm saying. I won't be a part of\r\nyour plans anymore.\"\r\n\r\nI didn't say anything.\r\n\r\n\"I know that's leaving you on your own. I don't want that, believe me.\r\nI'd much rather you give up with me. You can't declare war on the\r\ngovernment of the USA. It's not a fight you're going to win. Watching\r\nyou try is like watching a bird fly into a window again and again.\"\r\n\r\nHe wanted me to say something. What *I* wanted to say was, *Jesus Jolu,\r\nthanks so very much for abandoning me! Do you forget what it was like\r\nwhen they took us away? Do you forget what the country used to be like\r\nbefore they took it over?* But that's not what he wanted me to say.\r\nWhat he wanted me to say was:\r\n\r\n\"I understand, Jolu. I respect your choice.\"\r\n\r\nHe drank the rest of his bottle and pulled out another one and twisted\r\noff the cap.\r\n\r\n\"There's something else,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't going to mention it, but I want you to understand why I have\r\nto do this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jesus, Jolu, *what*?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hate to say it, but you're *white*. I'm not. White people get caught\r\nwith cocaine and do a little rehab time. Brown people get caught with\r\ncrack and go to prison for twenty years. White people see cops on the\r\nstreet and feel safer. Brown people see cops on the street and wonder\r\nif they're about to get searched. The way the DHS is treating you? The\r\nlaw in this country has always been like that for us.\"\r\n\r\nIt was so unfair. I didn't ask to be white. I didn't think I was being\r\nbraver just because I'm white. But I knew what Jolu was saying. If the\r\ncops stopped someone in the Mission and asked to see some ID, chances\r\nwere that person wasn't white. Whatever risk I ran, Jolu ran more.\r\nWhatever penalty I'd pay, Jolu would pay more.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what to say,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"You don't have to say anything,\" he said. \"I just wanted you to know,\r\nso you could understand.\"\r\n\r\nI could see people walking down the side trail toward us. They were\r\nfriends of Jolu's, two Mexican guys and a girl I knew from around,\r\nshort and geeky, always wearing cute black Buddy Holly glasses that\r\nmade her look like the outcast art-student in a teen movie who comes\r\nback as the big success.\r\n\r\nJolu introduced me and gave them beers. The girl didn't take one, but\r\ninstead produced a small silver flask of vodka from her purse and\r\noffered me a drink. I took a swallow -- warm vodka must be an acquired\r\ntaste -- and complimented her on the flask, which was embossed with a\r\nrepeating motif of Parappa the Rapper characters.\r\n\r\n\"It's Japanese,\" she said as I played another LED keyring over it.\r\n\"They have all these great booze-toys based on kids' games. Totally\r\ntwisted.\"\r\n\r\nI introduced myself and she introduced herself. \"Ange,\" she said, and\r\nshook my hand with hers -- dry, warm, with short nails. Jolu introduced\r\nme to his pals, whom he'd known since computer camp in the fourth\r\ngrade. More people showed up -- five, then ten, then twenty. It was a\r\nseriously big group now.\r\n\r\nWe'd told people to arrive by 9:30 sharp, and we gave it until 9:45 to\r\nsee who all would show up. About three quarters were Jolu's friends.\r\nI'd invited all the people I really trusted. Either I was more\r\ndiscriminating than Jolu or less popular. Now that he'd told me he was\r\nquitting, it made me think that he was less discriminating. I was\r\nreally pissed at him, but trying not to let it show by concentrating on\r\nsocializing with other people. But he wasn't stupid. He knew what was\r\ngoing on. I could see that he was really bummed. Good.\r\n\r\n\"OK,\" I said, climbing up on a ruin, \"OK, hey, hello?\" A few people\r\nnearby paid attention to me, but the ones in the back kept on chatting.\r\nI put my arms in the air like a referee, but it was too dark.\r\nEventually I hit on the idea of turning my LED keychain on and pointing\r\nit at each of the talkers in turn, then at me. Gradually, the crowd\r\nfell quiet.\r\n\r\nI welcomed them and thanked them all for coming, then asked them to\r\nclose in so I could explain why we were there. I could tell they were\r\ninto the secrecy of it all, intrigued and a little warmed up by the\r\nbeer.\r\n\r\n\"So here it is. You all use the Xnet. It's no coincidence that the Xnet\r\nwas created right after the DHS took over the city. The people who did\r\nthat are an organization devoted to personal liberty, who created the\r\nnetwork to keep us safe from DHS spooks and enforcers.\" Jolu and I had\r\nworked this out in advance. We weren't going to cop to being behind it\r\nall, not to anyone. It was way too risky. Instead, we'd put it out that\r\nwe were merely lieutenants in \"M1k3y\"'s army, acting to organize the\r\nlocal resistance.\r\n\r\n\"The Xnet isn't pure,\" I said. \"It can be used by the other side just\r\nas readily as by us. We know that there are DHS spies who use it now.\r\nThey use social engineering hacks to try to get us to reveal ourselves\r\nso that they can bust us. If the Xnet is going to succeed, we need to\r\nfigure out how to keep them from spying on us. We need a network within\r\nthe network.\"\r\n\r\nI paused and let this sink in. Jolu had suggested that this might be a\r\nlittle heavy -- learning that you're about to be brought into a\r\nrevolutionary cell.\r\n\r\n\"Now, I'm not here to ask you to do anything active. You don't have to\r\ngo out jamming or anything. You've been brought here because we know\r\nyou're cool, we know you're trustworthy. It's that trustworthiness I\r\nwant to get you to contribute tonight. Some of you will already be\r\nfamiliar with the web of trust and keysigning parties, but for the rest\r\nof you, I'll run it down quickly --\" Which I did.\r\n\r\n\"Now what I want from you tonight is to meet the people here and figure\r\nout how much you can trust them. We're going to help you generate\r\nkey-pairs and share them with each other.\"\r\n\r\nThis part was tricky. Asking people to bring their own laptops wouldn't\r\nhave worked out, but we still needed to do something hella complicated\r\nthat wouldn't exactly work with paper and pencil.\r\n\r\nI held up a laptop Jolu and I had rebuilt the night before, from the\r\nground up. \"I trust this machine. Every component in it was laid by our\r\nown hands. It's running a fresh out-of-the-box version of\r\nParanoidLinux, booted off of the DVD. If there's a trustworthy computer\r\nleft anywhere in the world, this might well be it.\r\n\r\n\"I've got a key-generator loaded here. You come up here and give it\r\nsome random input -- mash the keys, wiggle the mouse -- and it will use\r\nthat as the seed to create a random public- and private key for you,\r\nwhich it will display on the screen. You can take a picture of the\r\nprivate key with your phone, and hit any key to make it go away forever\r\n-- it's not stored on the disk at all. Then it will show you your\r\npublic key. At that point, you call over all the people here you trust\r\nand who trust you, and *they* take a picture of the screen with you\r\nstanding next to it, so they know whose key it is.\r\n\r\n\"When you get home, you have to convert the photos to keys. This is\r\ngoing to be a lot of work, I'm afraid, but you'll only have to do it\r\nonce. You have to be super-careful about typing these in -- one mistake\r\nand you're screwed. Luckily, we've got a way to tell if you've got it\r\nright: beneath the key will be a much shorter number, called the\r\n'fingerprint'. Once you've typed in the key, you can generate a\r\nfingerprint from it and compare it to the fingerprint, and if they\r\nmatch, you've got it right.\"\r\n\r\nThey all boggled at me. OK, so I'd asked them to do something pretty\r\nweird, it's true, but still.\r\n\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nChapter 11\r\n\r\n[[This chapter is dedicated to the University Bookstore at the\r\nUniversity of Washington, whose science fiction section rivals many\r\nspecialty stores, thanks to the sharp-eyed, dedicated science fiction\r\nbuyer, Duane Wilkins.

This is how we know which side you're\r\non. You might not be willing to take to the streets and get busted for\r\nyour beliefs, but if you *have* beliefs, this will let us know it. This\r\nwill create the web of trust that tells us who's in and who's out. If\r\nwe're ever going to get our country back, we need to do this. We need\r\nto do something like this.\"\r\n\r\nSomeone in the audience -- it was Ange -- had a hand up, holding a beer\r\nbottle.\r\n\r\n\"So call me stupid but I don't understand this at all. Why do you want\r\nus to do this?\"\r\n\r\nJolu looked at me, and I looked back at him. It had all seemed so\r\nobvious when we were organizing it. \"The Xnet isn't just a way to play\r\nfree games. It's the last open communications network in America. It's\r\nthe last way to communicate without being snooped on by the DHS. For it\r\nto work we need to know that the person we're talking to isn't a snoop.\r\nThat means that we need to know that the people we're sending messages\r\nto are the people we think they are.\r\n\r\n\"That's where you come in. You're all here because we trust you. I\r\nmean, really trust you. Trust you with our lives.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the people groaned. It sounded melodramatic and stupid.\r\n\r\nI got back to my feet.\r\n\r\n\"When the bombs went off,\" I said, then something welled up in my\r\nchest, something painful. \"When the bombs went off, there were four of\r\nus caught up by Market Street. For whatever reason, the DHS decided\r\nthat made us suspicious. They put bags over our heads, put us on a ship\r\nand interrogated us for days. They humiliated us. Played games with our\r\nminds. Then they let us go.\r\n\r\n\"All except one person. My best friend. He was with us when they picked\r\nus up. He'd been hurt and he needed medical care. He never came out\r\nagain. They say they never saw him. They say that if we ever tell\r\nanyone about this, they'll arrest us and make us disappear.\r\n\r\n\"Forever.\"\r\n\r\nI was shaking. The shame. The goddamned shame. Jolu had the light on\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"Oh Christ,\" I said. \"You people are the first ones I've told. If this\r\nstory gets around, you can bet they'll know who leaked it. You can bet\r\nthey'll come knocking on my door.\" I took some more deep breaths.\r\n\"That's why I volunteered on the Xnet. That's why my life, from now on,\r\nis about fighting the DHS. With every breath. Every day. Until we're\r\nfree again. Any one of you could put me in jail now, if you wanted to.\"\r\n\r\nAnge put her hand up again. \"We're not going to rat on you,\" she said.\r\n\"No way. I know pretty much everyone here and I can promise you that. I\r\ndon't know how to know who to trust, but I know who *not* to trust: old\r\npeople. Our parents. Grownups. When they think of someone being spied\r\non, they think of someone *else*, a bad guy. When they think of someone\r\nbeing caught and sent to a secret prison, it's someone *else* --\r\nsomeone brown, someone young, someone foreign.\r\n\r\n\"They forget what it's like to be our age. To be the object of\r\nsuspicion *all the time*! How many times have you gotten on the bus and\r\nhad every person on it give you a look like you'd been gargling turds\r\nand skinning puppies?\r\n\r\n\"What's worse, they're turning into adults younger and younger out\r\nthere. Back in the day, they used to say 'Never trust anyone over 30.'\r\nI say, 'Don't trust any bastard over 25!'\"\r\n\r\nThat got a laugh, and she laughed too. She was pretty, in a weird,\r\nhorsey way, with a long face and a long jaw. \"I'm not really kidding,\r\nyou know? I mean, think about it. Who elected these ass-clowns? Who let\r\nthem invade our city? Who voted to put the cameras in our classrooms\r\nand follow us around with creepy spyware chips in our transit passes\r\nand cars? It wasn't a 16-year-old. We may be dumb, we may be young, but\r\nwe're not scum.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want that on a t-shirt,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"It would be a good one,\" she said. We smiled at each other.\r\n\r\n\"Where do I go to get my keys?\" she said, and pulled out her phone.\r\n\r\n\"We'll do it over there, in the secluded spot by the caves. I'll take\r\nyou in there and set you up, then you do your thing and take the\r\nmachine around to your friends to get photos of your public key so they\r\ncan sign it when they get home.\"\r\n\r\nI raised my voice. \"Oh! One more thing! Jesus, I can't believe I forgot\r\nthis. *Delete those photos once you've typed in the keys*! The last\r\nthing we want is a Flickr stream full of pictures of all of us\r\nconspiring together.\"\r\n\r\nThere was some good-natured, nervous chuckling, then Jolu turned out\r\nthe light and in the sudden darkness I could see nothing. Gradually, my\r\neyes adjusted and I set off for the cave. Someone was walking behind\r\nme. Ange. I turned and smiled at her, and she smiled back, luminous\r\nteeth in the dark.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks for that,\" I said. \"You were great.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean what you said about the bag on your head and everything?\"\r\n\r\n\"I meant it,\" I said. \"It happened. I never told anyone, but it\r\nhappened.\" I thought about it for a moment. \"You know, with all the\r\ntime that went by since, without saying anything, it started to feel\r\nlike a bad dream. It was real though.\" I stopped and climbed up into\r\nthe cave. \"I'm glad I finally told people. Any longer and I might have\r\nstarted to doubt my own sanity.\"\r\n\r\nI set up the laptop on a dry bit of rock and booted it from the DVD\r\nwith her watching. \"I'm going to reboot it for every person. This is a\r\nstandard ParanoidLinux disc, though I guess you'd have to take my word\r\nfor it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hell,\" she said. \"This is all about trust, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" I said. \"Trust.\"\r\n\r\nI retreated some distance as she ran the key-generator, listening to\r\nher typing and mousing to create randomness, listening to the crash of\r\nthe surf, listening to the party noises from over where the beer was.\r\n\r\nShe stepped out of the cave, carrying the laptop. On it, in huge white\r\nluminous letters, were her public key and her fingerprint and email\r\naddress. She held the screen up beside her face and waited while I got\r\nmy phone out.\r\n\r\n\"Cheese,\" she said. I snapped her pic and dropped the camera back in my\r\npocket. She wandered off to the revelers and let them each get pics of\r\nher and the screen. It was festive. Fun. She really had a lot of\r\ncharisma -- you didn't want to laugh at her, you just wanted to laugh\r\n*with* her. And hell, it *was* funny! We were declaring a secret war on\r\nthe secret police. Who the hell did we think we were?\r\n\r\nSo it went, through the next hour or so, everyone taking pictures and\r\nmaking keys. I got to meet everyone there. I knew a lot of them -- some\r\nwere my invitees -- and the others were friends of my pals or my pals'\r\npals. We should all be buddies. We were, by the time the night was out.\r\nThey were all good people.\r\n\r\nOnce everyone was done, Jolu went to make a key, and then turned away,\r\ngiving me a sheepish grin. I was past my anger with him, though. He was\r\ndoing what he had to do. I knew that no matter what he said, he'd\r\nalways be there for me. And we'd been through the DHS jail together.\r\nVan too. No matter what, that would bind us together forever.\r\n\r\nI did my key and did the perp-walk around the gang, letting everyone\r\nsnap a pic. Then I climbed up on the high spot I'd spoken from earlier\r\nand called for everyone's attention.\r\n\r\n\"So a lot of you have noted that there's a vital flaw in this\r\nprocedure: what if this laptop can't be trusted? What if it's secretly\r\nrecording our instructions? What if it's spying on us? What if\r\nJose-Luis and I can't be trusted?\"\r\n\r\nMore good-natured chuckles. A little warmer than before, more beery.\r\n\r\n\"I mean it,\" I said. \"If we were on the wrong side, this could get all\r\nof us -- all of *you* -- into a heap of trouble. Jail, maybe.\"\r\n\r\nThe chuckles turned more nervous.\r\n\r\n\"So that's why I'm going to do this,\" I said, and picked up a hammer\r\nI'd brought from my Dad's toolkit. I set the laptop down beside me on\r\nthe rock and swung the hammer, Jolu following the swing with his\r\nkeychain light. Crash -- I'd always dreamt of killing a laptop with a\r\nhammer, and here I was doing it. It felt pornographically good. And\r\nbad.\r\n\r\nSmash! The screen-panel fell off, shattered into millions of pieces,\r\nexposing the keyboard. I kept hitting it, until the keyboard fell off,\r\nexposing the motherboard and the hard-drive. Crash! I aimed square for\r\nthe hard-drive, hitting it with everything I had. It took three blows\r\nbefore the case split, exposing the fragile media inside. I kept\r\nhitting it until there was nothing bigger than a cigarette lighter,\r\nthen I put it all in a garbage bag. The crowd was cheering wildly --\r\nloud enough that I actually got worried that someone far above us might\r\nhear over the surf and call the law.\r\n\r\n\"All right!\" I called. \"Now, if you'd like to accompany me, I'm going\r\nto march this down to the sea and soak it in salt water for ten\r\nminutes.\"\r\n\r\nI didn't have any takers at first, but then Ange came forward and took\r\nmy arm in her warm hand and said, \"That was beautiful,\" in my ear and\r\nwe marched down to the sea together.\r\n\r\nIt was perfectly dark by the sea, and treacherous, even with our\r\nkeychain lights. Slippery, sharp rocks that were difficult enough to\r\nwalk on even without trying to balance six pounds of smashed\r\nelectronics in a plastic bag. I slipped once and thought I was going to\r\ncut myself up, but she caught me with a surprisingly strong grip and\r\nkept me upright. I was pulled in right close to her, close enough to\r\nsmell her perfume, which smelled like new cars. I love that smell.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" I managed, looking into the big eyes that were further\r\nmagnified by her mannish, black-rimmed glasses. I couldn't tell what\r\ncolor they were in the dark, but I guessed something dark, based on her\r\ndark hair and olive complexion. She looked Mediterranean, maybe Greek\r\nor Spanish or Italian.\r\n\r\nI crouched down and dipped the bag in the sea, letting it fill with\r\nsalt water. I managed to slip a little and soak my shoe, and I swore\r\nand she laughed. We'd hardly said a word since we lit out for the\r\nocean. There was something magical in our wordless silence.\r\n\r\nAt that point, I had kissed a total of three girls in my life, not\r\ncounting that moment when I went back to school and got a hero's\r\nwelcome. That's not a gigantic number, but it's not a minuscule one,\r\neither. I have reasonable girl radar, and I think I could have kissed\r\nher. She wasn't h4wt in the traditional sense, but there's something\r\nabout a girl and a night and a beach, plus she was smart and passionate\r\nand committed.\r\n\r\nBut I didn't kiss her, or take her hand. Instead we had a moment that I\r\ncan only describe as spiritual. The surf, the night, the sea and the\r\nrocks, and our breathing. The moment stretched. I sighed. This had been\r\nquite a ride. I had a lot of typing to do tonight, putting all those\r\nkeys into my keychain, signing them and publishing the signed keys.\r\nStarting the web of trust.\r\n\r\nShe sighed too.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" she said.\r\n\r\nBack we went. It was a good night, that night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJolu waited after for his brother's friend to come by and pick up his\r\ncoolers. I walked with everyone else up the road to the nearest Muni\r\nstop and got on board. Of course, none of us was using an issued Muni\r\npass. By that point, Xnetters habitually cloned someone else's Muni\r\npass three or four times a day, assuming a new identity for every ride.\r\n\r\nIt was hard to stay cool on the bus. We were all a little drunk, and\r\nlooking at our faces under the bright bus lights was kind of hilarious.\r\nWe got pretty loud and the driver used his intercom to tell us to keep\r\nit down twice, then told us to shut up right now or he'd call the cops.\r\n\r\nThat set us to giggling again and we disembarked in a mass before he\r\ndid call the cops. We were in North Beach now, and there were lots of\r\nbuses, taxis, the BART at Market Street, neon-lit clubs and cafes to\r\npull apart our grouping, so we drifted away.\r\n\r\nI got home and fired up my Xbox and started typing in keys from my\r\nphone's screen. It was dull, hypnotic work. I was a little drunk, and\r\nit lulled me into a half-sleep.\r\n\r\nI was about ready to nod off when a new IM window popped up.\r\n\r\n> herro!\r\n\r\nI didn't recognize the handle -- spexgril -- but I had an idea who\r\nmight be behind it.\r\n\r\n> hi\r\n\r\nI typed, cautiously.\r\n\r\n> it's me, from tonight\r\n\r\nThen she paste-bombed a block of crypto. I'd already entered her public\r\nkey into my keychain, so I told the IM client to try decrypting the\r\ncode with the key.\r\n\r\n> it's me, from tonight\r\n\r\nIt was her!\r\n\r\n> Fancy meeting you here\r\n\r\nI typed, then encrypted it to my public key and mailed it off.\r\n\r\n> It was great meeting you\r\n\r\nI typed.\r\n\r\n> You too. I don't meet too many smart guys who are also cute and also\r\n> socially aware. Good god, man, you don't give a girl much of a\r\n> chance.\r\n\r\nMy heart hammered in my chest.\r\n\r\n> Hello? Tap tap? This thing on? I wasn't born here folks, but I'm sure\r\n> dying here. Don't forget to tip your waitresses, they work hard. I'm\r\n> here all week.\r\n\r\nI laughed aloud.\r\n\r\n> I'm here, I'm here. Laughing too hard to type is all\r\n\r\n> Well at least my IM comedy-fu is still mighty\r\n\r\nUm.\r\n\r\n> It was really great to meet you too\r\n\r\n> Yeah, it usually is. Where are you taking me?\r\n\r\n> Taking you?\r\n\r\n> On our next adventure?\r\n\r\n> I didn't really have anything planned\r\n\r\n> Oki -- then I'll take YOU. Saturday. Dolores Park. Illegal open air\r\n> concert. Be there or be a dodecahedron\r\n\r\n> Wait what?\r\n\r\n> Don't you even read Xnet? It's all over the place. You ever hear of\r\n> the Speedwhores?\r\n\r\nI nearly choked. That was Trudy Doo's band -- as in Trudy Doo, the\r\nwoman who had paid me and Jolu to update the indienet code.\r\n\r\n> Yeah I've heard of them\r\n\r\n> They're putting on a huge show and they've got like fifty bands\r\n> signed to play the bill, going to set up on the tennis courts and\r\n> bring out their own amp trucks and rock out all night\r\n\r\nI felt like I'd been living under a rock. How had I missed that? There\r\nwas an anarchist bookstore on Valencia that I sometimes passed on the\r\nway to school that had a poster of an old revolutionary named Emma\r\nGoldman with the caption \"If I can't dance, I don't want to be a part\r\nof your revolution.\" I'd been spending all my energies on figuring out\r\nhow to use the Xnet to organize dedicated fighters so they could jam\r\nthe DHS, but this was so much cooler. A big concert -- I had no idea\r\nhow to do one of those, but I was glad someone did.\r\n\r\nAnd now that I thought of it, I was damned proud that they were using\r\nthe Xnet to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day I was a zombie. Ange and I had chatted -- flirted -- until\r\n4AM. Lucky for me, it was a Saturday and I was able to sleep in, but\r\nbetween the hangover and the sleep-dep, I could barely put two thoughts\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nBy lunchtime, I managed to get up and get my ass out onto the streets.\r\nI staggered down toward the Turk's to buy my coffee -- these days, if I\r\nwas alone, I always bought my coffee there, like the Turk and I were\r\npart of a secret club.\r\n\r\nOn the way, I passed a lot of fresh graffiti. I liked Mission graffiti;\r\na lot of the times, it came in huge, luscious murals, or sarcastic\r\nart-student stencils. I liked that the Mission's taggers kept right on\r\ngoing, under the nose of the DHS. Another kind of Xnet, I supposed --\r\nthey must have all kinds of ways of knowing what was going on, where to\r\nget paint, what cameras worked. Some of the cameras had been\r\nspray-painted over, I noticed.\r\n\r\nMaybe they used Xnet!\r\n\r\nPainted in ten-foot-high letters on the side of an auto-yard's fence\r\nwere the drippy words: DON'T TRUST ANYONE OVER 25.\r\n\r\nI stopped. Had someone left my \"party\" last night and come here with a\r\ncan of paint? A lot of those people lived in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nI got my coffee and had a little wander around town. I kept thinking I\r\nshould be calling someone, seeing if they wanted to get a movie or\r\nsomething. That's how it used to be on a lazy Saturday like this. But\r\nwho was I going to call? Van wasn't talking to me, I didn't think I was\r\nready to talk to Jolu, and Darryl --\r\n\r\nWell, I couldn't call Darryl.\r\n\r\nI got my coffee and went home and did a little searching around on the\r\nXnet's blogs. These anonablogs were untraceable to any author -- unless\r\nthat author was stupid enough to put her name on it -- and there were a\r\nlot of them. Most of them were apolitical, but a lot of them weren't.\r\nThey talked about schools and the unfairness there. They talked about\r\nthe cops. Tagging.\r\n\r\nTurned out there'd been plans for the concert in the park for weeks. It\r\nhad hopped from blog to blog, turning into a full-blown movement\r\nwithout my noticing. And the concert was called Don't Trust Anyone Over\r\n25.\r\n\r\nWell, that explained where Ange got it. It was a good slogan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMonday morning, I decided I wanted to check out that anarchist\r\nbookstore again, see about getting one of those Emma Goldman posters. I\r\nneeded the reminder.\r\n\r\nI detoured down to 16th and Mission on my way to school, then up to\r\nValencia and across. The store was shut, but I got the hours off the\r\ndoor and made sure they still had that poster up.\r\n\r\nAs I walked down Valencia, I was amazed to see how much of the DON'T\r\nTRUST ANYONE OVER 25 stuff there was. Half the shops had DON'T TRUST\r\nmerch in the windows: lunchboxes, babydoll tees, pencil-boxes, trucker\r\nhats. The hipster stores have been getting faster and faster, of\r\ncourse. As new memes sweep the net in the course of a day or two,\r\nstores have gotten better at putting merch in the windows to match.\r\nSome funny little youtube of a guy launching himself with jet-packs\r\nmade of carbonated water would land in your inbox on Monday and by\r\nTuesday you'd be able to buy t-shirts with stills from the video on it.\r\n\r\nBut it was amazing to see something make the leap from Xnet to the head\r\nshops. Distressed designer jeans with the slogan written in careful\r\nhigh school ball-point ink. Embroidered patches.\r\n\r\nGood news travels fast.\r\n\r\nIt was written on the black-board when I got to Ms Galvez's Social\r\nStudies class. We all sat at our desks, smiling at it. It seemed to\r\nsmile back. There was something profoundly cheering about the idea that\r\nwe could all trust each other, that the enemy could be identified. I\r\nknew it wasn't entirely true, but it wasn't entirely false either.\r\n\r\nMs Galvez came in and patted her hair and set down her SchoolBook on\r\nher desk and powered it up. She picked up her chalk and turned around\r\nto face the board. We all laughed. Good-naturedly, but we laughed.\r\n\r\nShe turned around and was laughing too. \"Inflation has hit the nation's\r\nslogan-writers, it seems. How many of you know where this phrase comes\r\nfrom?\"\r\n\r\nWe looked at each other. \"Hippies?\" someone said, and we laughed.\r\nHippies are all over San Francisco, both the old stoner kinds with\r\ngiant skanky beards and tie-dyes, and the new kind, who are more into\r\ndress-up and maybe playing hacky-sack than protesting anything.\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes, hippies. But when we think of hippies these days, we just\r\nthink of the clothes and the music. Clothes and music were incidental\r\nto the main part of what made that era, the sixties, important.\r\n\r\n\"You've heard about the civil rights movement to end segregation, white\r\nand black kids like you riding buses into the South to sign up black\r\nvoters and protest against official state racism. California was one of\r\nthe main places where the civil rights leaders came from. We've always\r\nbeen a little more political than the rest of the country, and this is\r\nalso a part of the country where black people have been able to get the\r\nsame union factory jobs as white people, so they were a little better\r\noff than their cousins in the southland.\r\n\r\n\"The students at Berkeley sent a steady stream of freedom riders south,\r\nand they recruited them from information tables on campus, at Bancroft\r\nand Telegraph Avenue. You've probably seen that there are still tables\r\nthere to this day.\r\n\r\n\"Well, the campus tried to shut them down. The president of the\r\nuniversity banned political organizing on campus, but the civil rights\r\nkids wouldn't stop. The police tried to arrest a guy who was handing\r\nout literature from one of these tables, and they put him in a van, but\r\n3,000 students surrounded the van and refused to let it budge. They\r\nwouldn't let them take this kid to jail. They stood on top of the van\r\nand gave speeches about the First Amendment and Free Speech.\r\n\r\n\"That galvanized the Free Speech Movement. That was the start of the\r\nhippies, but it was also where more radical student movements came\r\nfrom. Black power groups like the Black Panthers -- and later gay\r\nrights groups like the Pink Panthers, too. Radical women's groups, even\r\n'lesbian separatists' who wanted to abolish men altogether! And the\r\nYippies. Anyone ever hear of the Yippies?\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't they levitate the Pentagon?\" I said. I'd once seen a\r\ndocumentary about this.\r\n\r\nShe laughed. \"I forgot about that, but yes, that was them! Yippies were\r\nlike very political hippies, but they weren't serious the way we think\r\nof politics these days. They were very playful. Pranksters. They threw\r\nmoney into the New York Stock Exchange. They circled the Pentagon with\r\nhundreds of protestors and said a magic spell that was supposed to\r\nlevitate it. They invented a fictional kind of LSD that you could spray\r\nonto people with squirt-guns and shot each other with it and pretended\r\nto be stoned. They were funny and they made great TV -- one Yippie, a\r\nclown called Wavy Gravy, used to get hundreds of protestors to dress up\r\nlike Santa Claus so that the cameras would show police officers\r\narresting and dragging away Santa on the news that night -- and they\r\nmobilized a lot of people.\r\n\r\n\"Their big moment was the Democratic National Convention in 1968, where\r\nthey called for demonstrations to protest the Vietnam War. Thousands of\r\ndemonstrators poured into Chicago, slept in the parks, and picketed\r\nevery day. They had lots of bizarre stunts that year, like running a\r\npig called Pigasus for the presidential nomination. The police and the\r\ndemonstrators fought in the streets -- they'd done that many times\r\nbefore, but the Chicago cops didn't have the smarts to leave the\r\nreporters alone. They beat up the reporters, and the reporters\r\nretaliated by finally showing what really went on at these\r\ndemonstrations, so the whole country watched their kids being really\r\nsavagely beaten down by the Chicago police. They called it a 'police\r\nriot.'\r\n\r\n\"The Yippies loved to say, 'Never trust anyone over 30.' They meant\r\nthat people who were born before a certain time, when America had been\r\nfighting enemies like the Nazis, could never understand what it meant\r\nto love your country enough to refuse to fight the Vietnamese. They\r\nthought that by the time you hit 30, your attitudes would be frozen and\r\nyou couldn't ever understand why the kids of the day were taken to the\r\nstreets, dropping out, freaking out.\r\n\r\n\"San Francisco was ground zero for this. Revolutionary armies were\r\nfounded here. Some of them blew up buildings or robbed banks for their\r\ncause. A lot of those kids grew up to be more or less normal, while\r\nothers ended up in jail. Some of the university dropouts did amazing\r\nthings -- for example, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, who founded Apple\r\nComputers and invented the PC.\"\r\n\r\nI was really getting into this. I knew a little of it, but I'd never\r\nheard it told like this. Or maybe it had never mattered as much as it\r\ndid now. Suddenly, those lame, solemn, grown-up street demonstrations\r\ndidn't seem so lame after all. Maybe there was room for that kind of\r\naction in the Xnet movement.\r\n\r\nI put my hand up. \"Did they win? Did the Yippies win?\"\r\n\r\nShe gave me a long look, like she was thinking it over. No one said a\r\nword. We all wanted to hear the answer.\r\n\r\n\"They didn't lose,\" she said. \"They kind of imploded a little. Some of\r\nthem went to jail for drugs or other things. Some of them changed their\r\ntunes and became yuppies and went on the lecture circuit telling\r\neveryone how stupid they'd been, talking about how good greed was and\r\nhow dumb they'd been.\r\n\r\n\"But they did change the world. The war in Vietnam ended, and the kind\r\nof conformity and unquestioning obedience that people had called\r\npatriotism went out of style in a big way. Black rights, women's rights\r\nand gay rights came a long way. Chicano rights, rights for disabled\r\npeople, the whole tradition of civil liberties was created or\r\nstrengthened by these people. Today's protest movement is the direct\r\ndescendant of those struggles.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't believe you're talking about them like this,\" Charles said. He\r\nwas leaning so far in his seat he was half standing, and his sharp,\r\nskinny face had gone red. He had wet, large eyes and big lips, and when\r\nhe got excited he looked a little like a fish.\r\n\r\nMs Galvez stiffened a little, then said, \"Go on, Charles.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've just described terrorists. Actual terrorists. They blew up\r\nbuildings, you said. They tried to destroy the stock exchange. They\r\nbeat up cops, and stopped cops from arresting people who were breaking\r\nthe law. They attacked us!\"\r\n\r\nMs Galvez nodded slowly. I could tell she was trying to figure out how\r\nto handle Charles, who really seemed like he was ready to pop. \"Charles\r\nraises a good point. The Yippies weren't foreign agents, they were\r\nAmerican citizens. When you say 'They attacked us,' you need to figure\r\nout who 'they' and 'us' are. When it's your fellow countrymen --\"\r\n\r\n\"Crap!\" he shouted. He was on his feet now. \"We were at war then. These\r\nguys were giving aid and comfort to the enemy. It's easy to tell who's\r\nus and who's them: if you support America, you're us. If you support\r\nthe people who are shooting at Americans, you're *them*.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does anyone else want to comment on this?\"\r\n\r\nSeveral hands shot up. Ms Galvez called on them. Some people pointed\r\nout that the reason that the Vietnamese were shooting at Americans is\r\nthat the Americans had flown to Vietnam and started running around the\r\njungle with guns. Others thought that Charles had a point, that people\r\nshouldn't be allowed to do illegal things.\r\n\r\nEveryone had a good debate except Charles, who just shouted at people,\r\ninterrupting them when they tried to get their points out. Ms Galvez\r\ntried to get him to wait for his turn a couple times, but he wasn't\r\nhaving any of it.\r\n\r\nI was looking something up on my SchoolBook, something I knew I'd read.\r\n\r\nI found it. I stood up. Ms Galvez looked expectantly at me. The other\r\npeople followed her gaze and went quiet. Even Charles looked at me\r\nafter a while, his big wet eyes burning with hatred for me.\r\n\r\n\"I wanted to read something,\" I said. \"It's short. 'Governments are\r\ninstituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of\r\nthe governed, that whenever any form of government becomes destructive\r\nof these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it,\r\nand to institute new government, laying its foundation on such\r\nprinciples, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall\r\nseem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.'\"\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nChapter 12\r\n\r\n[[This chapter is dedicated to Forbidden Planet, the British chain of\r\nscience fiction and fantasy books, comics, toys and videos.

They were talking\r\nabout a government that existed because some old jerk's\r\ngreat-great-great-grandfather believed that God put him in charge and\r\nkilled everyone who disagreed with him. We have a democratically\r\nelected government --\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't vote for them,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"So that gives you the right to blow up a building?\"\r\n\r\n\"What? Who said anything about blowing up a building? The Yippies and\r\nhippies and all those people believed that the government no longer\r\nlistened to them -- look at the way people who tried to sign up voters\r\nin the South were treated! They were beaten up, arrested --\"\r\n\r\n\"Some of them were killed,\" Ms Galvez said. She held up her hands and\r\nwaited for Charles and me to sit down. \"We're almost out of time for\r\ntoday, but I want to commend you all on one of the most interesting\r\nclasses I've ever taught. This has been an excellent discussion and\r\nI've learned much from you all. I hope you've learned from each other,\r\ntoo. Thank you all for your contributions.\r\n\r\n\"I have an extra-credit assignment for those of you who want a little\r\nchallenge. I'd like you to write up a paper comparing the political\r\nresponse to the anti-war and civil rights movements in the Bay Area to\r\nthe present day civil rights responses to the War on Terror. Three\r\npages minimum, but take as long as you'd like. I'm interested to see\r\nwhat you come up with.\"\r\n\r\nThe bell rang a moment later and everyone filed out of the class. I\r\nhung back and waited for Ms Galvez to notice me.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Marcus?\"\r\n\r\n\"That was amazing,\" I said. \"I never knew all that stuff about the\r\nsixties.\"\r\n\r\n\"The seventies, too. This place has always been an exciting place to\r\nlive in politically charged times. I really liked your reference to the\r\nDeclaration -- that was very clever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" I said. \"It just came to me. I never really appreciated what\r\nthose words all meant before today.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, those are the words every teacher loves to hear, Marcus,\" she\r\nsaid, and shook my hand. \"I can't wait to read your paper.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI bought the Emma Goldman poster on the way home and stuck it up over\r\nmy desk, tacked over a vintage black-light poster. I also bought a\r\nNEVER TRUST t-shirt that had a photoshop of Grover and Elmo kicking the\r\ngrownups Gordon and Susan off Sesame Street. It made me laugh. I later\r\nfound out that there had already been about six photoshop contests for\r\nthe slogan online in places like Fark and Worth1000 and B3ta and there\r\nwere hundreds of ready-made pics floating around to go on whatever\r\nmerch someone churned out.\r\n\r\nMom raised an eyebrow at the shirt, and Dad shook his head and lectured\r\nme about not looking for trouble. I felt a little vindicated by his\r\nreaction.\r\n\r\nAnge found me online again and we IM-flirted until late at night again.\r\nThe white van with the antennas came back and I switched off my Xbox\r\nuntil it had passed. We'd all gotten used to doing that.\r\n\r\nAnge was really excited by this party. It looked like it was going to\r\nbe monster. There were so many bands signed up they were talking about\r\nsetting up a B-stage for the secondary acts.\r\n\r\n> How'd they get a permit to blast sound all night in that park?\r\n> There's houses all around there\r\n\r\n> Per-mit? What is \"per-mit\"? Tell me more of your hu-man per-mit.\r\n\r\n> Woah, it's illegal?\r\n\r\n> Um, hello? *You're* worried about breaking the law?\r\n\r\n> Fair point\r\n\r\n> LOL\r\n\r\nI felt a little premonition of nervousness though. I mean, I was taking\r\nthis perfectly awesome girl out on a date that weekend -- well, she was\r\ntaking me, technically -- to an illegal rave being held in the middle\r\nof a busy neighborhood.\r\n\r\nIt was bound to be interesting at least.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInteresting.\r\n\r\nPeople started to drift into Dolores Park through the long Saturday\r\nafternoon, showing up among the ultimate frisbee players and the\r\ndog-walkers. Some of them played frisbee or walked dogs. It wasn't\r\nreally clear how the concert was going to work, but there were a lot of\r\ncops and undercovers hanging around. You could tell the undercovers\r\nbecause, like Zit and Booger, they had Castro haircuts and Nebraska\r\nphysiques: tubby guys with short hair and untidy mustaches. They\r\ndrifted around, looking awkward and uncomfortable in their giant shorts\r\nand loose-fitting shirts that no-doubt hung down to cover the\r\nchandelier of gear hung around their midriffs.\r\n\r\nDolores Park is pretty and sunny, with palm trees, tennis courts, and\r\nlots of hills and regular trees to run around on, or hang out on.\r\nHomeless people sleep there at night, but that's true everywhere in San\r\nFrancisco.\r\n\r\nI met Ange down the street, at the anarchist bookstore. That had been\r\nmy suggestion. In hindsight, it was a totally transparent move to seem\r\ncool and edgy to this girl, but at the time I would have sworn that I\r\npicked it because it was a convenient place to meet up. She was reading\r\na book called *Up Against the Wall Motherf_____r* when I got there.\r\n\r\n\"Nice,\" I said. \"You kiss your mother with that mouth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your mama don't complain,\" she said. \"Actually, it's a history of a\r\ngroup of people like the Yippies, but from New York. They all used that\r\nword as their last names, like 'Ben M-F.' The idea was to have a group\r\nout there, making news, but with a totally unprintable name. Just to\r\nscrew around with the news-media. Pretty funny, really.\" She put the\r\nbook back on the shelf and now I wondered if I should hug her. People\r\nin California hug to say hello and goodbye all the time. Except when\r\nthey don't. And sometimes they kiss on the cheek. It's all very\r\nconfusing.\r\n\r\nShe settled it for me by grabbing me in a hug and tugging my head down\r\nto her, kissing me hard on the cheek, then blowing a fart on my neck. I\r\nlaughed and pushed her away.\r\n\r\n\"You want a burrito?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Is that a question or a statement of the obvious?\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither. It's an order.\"\r\n\r\nI bought some funny stickers that said THIS PHONE IS TAPPED which were\r\nthe right size to put on the receivers on the pay phones that still\r\nlined the streets of the Mission, it being the kind of neighborhood\r\nwhere you got people who couldn't necessarily afford a cellphone.\r\n\r\nWe walked out into the night air. I told Ange about the scene at the\r\npark when I left.\r\n\r\n\"I bet they have a hundred of those trucks parked around the block,\"\r\nshe said. \"The better to bust you with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Um.\" I looked around. \"I sort of hoped that you would say something\r\nlike, 'Aw, there's no chance they'll do anything about it.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think that's really the idea. The idea is to put a lot of\r\ncivilians in a position where the cops have to decide, are we going to\r\ntreat these ordinary people like terrorists? It's a little like the\r\njamming, but with music instead of gadgets. You jam, right?\"\r\n\r\nSometimes I forget that all my friends don't know that Marcus and M1k3y\r\nare the same person. \"Yeah, a little,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"This is like jamming with a bunch of awesome bands.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see.\"\r\n\r\nMission burritos are an institution. They are cheap, giant and\r\ndelicious. Imagine a tube the size of a bazooka shell, filled with\r\nspicy grilled meat, guacamole, salsa, tomatoes, refried beans, rice,\r\nonions and cilantro. It has the same relationship to Taco Bell that a\r\nLamborghini has to a Hot Wheels car.\r\n\r\nThere are about two hundred Mission burrito joints. They're all\r\nheroically ugly, with uncomfortable seats, minimal decor -- faded\r\nMexican tourist office posters and electrified framed Jesus and Mary\r\nholograms -- and loud mariachi music. The thing that distinguishes\r\nthem, mostly, is what kind of exotic meat they fill their wares with.\r\nThe really authentic places have brains and tongue, which I never\r\norder, but it's nice to know it's there.\r\n\r\nThe place we went to had both brains and tongue, which we didn't order.\r\nI got carne asada and she got shredded chicken and we each got a big\r\ncup of horchata.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we sat down, she unrolled her burrito and took a little\r\nbottle out of her purse. It was a little stainless-steel aerosol\r\ncanister that looked for all the world like a pepper-spray self-defense\r\nunit. She aimed it at her burrito's exposed guts and misted them with a\r\nfine red oily spray. I caught a whiff of it and my throat closed and my\r\neyes watered.\r\n\r\n\"What the hell are you doing to that poor, defenseless burrito?\"\r\n\r\nShe gave me a wicked smile. \"I'm a spicy food addict,\" she said. \"This\r\nis capsaicin oil in a mister.\"\r\n\r\n\"Capsaicin --\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, the stuff in pepper spray. This is like pepper spray but\r\nslightly more dilute. And way more delicious. Think of it as Spicy\r\nCajun Visine if it helps.\"\r\n\r\nMy eyes burned just thinking of it.\r\n\r\n\"You're kidding,\" I said. \"You are so not going to eat that.\"\r\n\r\nHer eyebrows shot up. \"That sounds like a challenge, sonny. You just\r\nwatch me.\"\r\n\r\nShe rolled the burrito up as carefully as a stoner rolling up a joint,\r\ntucking the ends in, then re-wrapping it in tinfoil. She peeled off one\r\nend and brought it up to her mouth, poised with it just before her\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nRight up to the time she bit into it, I couldn't believe that she was\r\ngoing to do it. I mean, that was basically an anti-personnel weapon\r\nshe'd just slathered on her dinner.\r\n\r\nShe bit into it. Chewed. Swallowed. Gave every impression of having a\r\ndelicious dinner.\r\n\r\n\"Want a bite?\" she said, innocently.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" I said. I like spicy food. I always order the curries with four\r\nchilies next to them on the menu at the Pakistani places.\r\n\r\nI peeled back more foil and took a big bite.\r\n\r\nBig mistake.\r\n\r\nYou know that feeling you get when you take a big bite of horseradish\r\nor wasabi or whatever, and it feels like your sinuses are closing at\r\nthe same time as your windpipe, filling your head with trapped,\r\nnuclear-hot air that tries to batter its way out through your watering\r\neyes and nostrils? That feeling like steam is about to pour out of your\r\nears like a cartoon character?\r\n\r\nThis was a lot worse.\r\n\r\nThis was like putting your hand on a hot stove, only it's not your\r\nhand, it's the entire inside of your head, and your esophagus all the\r\nway down to your stomach. My entire body sprang out in a sweat and I\r\nchoked and choked.\r\n\r\nWordlessly, she passed me my horchata and I managed to get the straw\r\ninto my mouth and suck hard on it, gulping down half of it in one go.\r\n\r\n\"So there's a scale, the Scoville scale, that we chili-fanciers use to\r\ntalk about how spicy a pepper is. Pure capsaicin is about 15 million\r\nScovilles. Tabasco is about 50,000. Pepper spray is a healthy three\r\nmillion. This stuff is a puny 200,000, about as hot as a mild Scotch\r\nBonnet Pepper. I worked up to it in about a year. Some of the real\r\nhardcore can get up to a million or so, twenty times hotter than\r\nTabasco. That's pretty freaking hot. At Scoville temperatures like\r\nthat, your brain gets totally awash in endorphins. It's a better\r\nbody-stone than hash. And it's good for you.\"\r\n\r\nI was getting my sinuses back now, able to breathe without gasping.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, you get a ferocious ring of fire when you go to the john,\"\r\nshe said, winking at me.\r\n\r\nYowch.\r\n\r\n\"You are insane,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Fine talk from a man whose hobby is building and smashing laptops,\"\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n\"Touche,\" I said and touched my forehead.\r\n\r\n\"Want some?\" She held out her mister.\r\n\r\n\"Pass,\" I said, quickly enough that we both laughed.\r\n\r\nWhen we left the restaurant and headed for Dolores park, she put her\r\narm around my waist and I found that she was just the right height for\r\nme to put my arm around her shoulders. That was new. I'd never been a\r\ntall guy, and the girls I'd dated had all been my height -- teenaged\r\ngirls grow faster than guys, which is a cruel trick of nature. It was\r\nnice. It felt nice.\r\n\r\nWe turned the corner on 20th Street and walked up toward Dolores.\r\nBefore we'd taken a single step, we could feel the buzz. It was like\r\nthe hum of a million bees. There were lots of people streaming toward\r\nthe park, and when I looked toward it, I saw that it was about a\r\nhundred times more crowded than it had been when I went to meet Ange.\r\n\r\nThat sight made my blood run hot. It was a beautiful cool night and we\r\nwere about to party, really party, party like there was no tomorrow.\r\n\"Eat drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die.\"\r\n\r\nWithout saying anything we both broke into a trot. There were lots of\r\ncops, with tense faces, but what the hell were they going to do? There\r\nwere a *lot* of people in the park. I'm not so good at counting crowds.\r\nThe papers later quoted organizers as saying there were 20,000 people;\r\nthe cops said 5,000. Maybe that means there were 12,500.\r\n\r\nWhatever. It was more people than I'd ever stood among, as part of an\r\nunscheduled, unsanctioned, *illegal* event.\r\n\r\nWe were among them in an instant. I can't swear to it, but I don't\r\nthink there was anyone over 25 in that press of bodies. Everyone was\r\nsmiling. Some young kids were there, 10 or 12, and that made me feel\r\nbetter. No one would do anything too stupid with kids that little in\r\nthe crowd. No one wanted to see little kids get hurt. This was just\r\ngoing to be a glorious spring night of celebration.\r\n\r\nI figured the thing to do was push in towards the tennis courts. We\r\nthreaded our way through the crowd, and to stay together we took each\r\nother's hands. Only staying together didn't require us to intertwine\r\nfingers. That was strictly for pleasure. It was very pleasurable.\r\n\r\nThe bands were all inside the tennis courts, with their guitars and\r\nmixers and keyboards and even a drum kit. Later, on Xnet, I found a\r\nFlickr stream of them smuggling all this stuff in, piece by piece, in\r\ngym bags and under their coats. Along with it all were huge speakers,\r\nthe kind you see in automotive supply places, and among them, a stack\r\nof...car batteries. I laughed. Genius! That was how they were going to\r\npower their stacks. From where I stood, I could see that they were\r\ncells from a hybrid car, a Prius. Someone had gutted an eco-mobile to\r\npower the night's entertainment. The batteries continued outside the\r\ncourts, stacked up against the fence, tethered to the main stack by\r\nwires threaded through the chain-link. I counted -- 200 batteries!\r\nChrist! Those things weighed a ton, too.\r\n\r\nThere's no way they organized this without email and wikis and mailing\r\nlists. And there's no way people this smart would have done that on the\r\npublic Internet. This had all taken place on the Xnet, I'd bet my boots\r\non it.\r\n\r\nWe just kind of bounced around in the crowd for a while as the bands\r\ntuned up and conferred with one another. I saw Trudy Doo from a\r\ndistance, in the tennis courts. She looked like she was in a cage, like\r\na pro wrestler. She was wearing a torn wife-beater and her hair was in\r\nlong, fluorescent pink dreads down to her waist. She was wearing army\r\ncamouflage pants and giant gothy boots with steel over-toes. As I\r\nwatched, she picked up a heavy motorcycle jacket, worn as a catcher's\r\nmitt, and put it on like armor. It probably was armor, I realized.\r\n\r\nI tried to wave to her, to impress Ange I guess, but she didn't see me\r\nand I kind of looked like a spazz so I stopped. The energy in the crowd\r\nwas amazing. You hear people talk about \"vibes\" and \"energy\" for big\r\ngroups of people, but until you've experienced it, you probably think\r\nit's just a figure of speech.\r\n\r\nIt's not. It's the smiles, infectious and big as watermelons, on every\r\nface. Everyone bopping a little to an unheard rhythm, shoulders\r\nrocking. Rolling walks. Jokes and laughs. The tone of every voice tight\r\nand excited, like a firework about to go off. And you can't help but be\r\na part of it. Because you are.\r\n\r\nBy the time the bands kicked off, I was utterly stoned on crowd-vibe.\r\nThe opening act was some kind of Serbian turbo-folk, which I couldn't\r\nfigure out how to dance to. I know how to dance to exactly two kinds of\r\nmusic: trance (shuffle around and let the music move you) and punk\r\n(bash around and mosh until you get hurt or exhausted or both). The\r\nnext act was Oakland hip-hoppers, backed by a thrash metal band, which\r\nis better than it sounds. Then some bubble-gum pop. Then Speedwhores\r\ntook the stage, and Trudy Doo stepped up to the mic.\r\n\r\n\"My name is Trudy Doo and you're an idiot if you trust me. I'm thirty\r\ntwo and it's too late for me. I'm lost. I'm stuck in the old way of\r\nthinking. I still take my freedom for granted and let other people take\r\nit away from me. You're the first generation to grow up in Gulag\r\nAmerica, and you know what your freedom is worth to the last goddamned\r\ncent!\"\r\n\r\nThe crowd roared. She was playing fast little skittery nervous chords\r\non her guitar and her bass player, a huge fat girl with a dykey haircut\r\nand even bigger boots and a smile you could open beer bottles with was\r\nlaying it down fast and hard already. I wanted to bounce. I bounced.\r\nAnge bounced with me. We were sweating freely in the evening, which\r\nreeked of perspiration and pot smoke. Warm bodies crushed in on all\r\nsides of us. They bounced too.\r\n\r\n\"Don't trust anyone over 25!\" she shouted.\r\n\r\nWe roared. We were one big animal throat, roaring.\r\n\r\n\"Don't trust anyone over 25!\"\r\n\r\n\"*Don't trust anyone over 25!*\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't trust anyone over 25!\"\r\n\r\n\"*Don't trust anyone over 25!*\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't trust anyone over 25!\"\r\n\r\n\"*Don't trust anyone over 25!*\"\r\n\r\nShe banged some hard chords on her guitar and the other guitarist, a\r\nlittle pixie of a girl whose face bristled with piercings, jammed in,\r\ngoing wheedle-dee-wheedle-dee-dee up high, past the twelfth fret.\r\n\r\n\"It's our goddamned city! It's our goddamned country. No terrorist can\r\ntake it from us for so long as we're free. Once we're not free, the\r\nterrorists win! Take it back! Take it back! You're young enough and\r\nstupid enough not to know that you can't possibly win, so you're the\r\nonly ones who can lead us to victory! *Take it back!\"\r\n\r\n\"TAKE IT BACK!\" we roared. She jammed down hard on her guitar. We\r\nroared the note back and then it got really really LOUD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI danced until I was so tired I couldn't dance another step. Ange\r\ndanced alongside of me. Technically, we were rubbing our sweaty bodies\r\nagainst each other for several hours, but believe it or not, I totally\r\nwasn't being a horn-dog about it. We were dancing, lost in the godbeat\r\nand the thrash and the screaming -- TAKE IT BACK! TAKE IT BACK!\r\n\r\nWhen I couldn't dance anymore, I grabbed her hand and she squeezed mine\r\nlike I was keeping her from falling off a building. She dragged me\r\ntoward the edge of the crowd, where it got thinner and cooler. Out\r\nthere, on the edge of Dolores Park, we were in the cool air and the\r\nsweat on our bodies went instantly icy. We shivered and she threw her\r\narms around my waist. \"Warm me,\" she commanded. I didn't need a hint. I\r\nhugged her back. Her heart was an echo of the fast beats from the stage\r\n-- breakbeats now, fast and furious and wordless.\r\n\r\nShe smelled of sweat, a sharp tang that smelled great. I knew I smelled\r\nof sweat too. My nose was pointed into the top of her head, and her\r\nface was right at my collarbone. She moved her hands to my neck and\r\ntugged.\r\n\r\n\"Get down here, I didn't bring a stepladder,\" is what she said and I\r\ntried to smile, but it's hard to smile when you're kissing.\r\n\r\nLike I said, I'd kissed three girls in my life. Two of them had never\r\nkissed anyone before. One had been dating since she was 12. She had\r\nissues.\r\n\r\nNone of them kissed like Ange. She made her whole mouth soft, like the\r\ninside of a ripe piece of fruit, and she didn't jam her tongue in my\r\nmouth, but slid it in there, and sucked my lips into her mouth at the\r\nsame time, so it was like my mouth and hers were merging. I heard\r\nmyself moan and I grabbed her and squeezed her harder.\r\n\r\nSlowly, gently, we lowered ourselves to the grass. We lay on our sides\r\nand clutched each other, kissing and kissing. The world disappeared so\r\nthere was only the kiss.\r\n\r\nMy hands found her butt, her waist. The edge of her t-shirt. Her warm\r\ntummy, her soft navel. They inched higher. She moaned too.\r\n\r\n\"Not here,\" she said. \"Let's move over there.\" She pointed across the\r\nstreet at the big white church that gives Mission Dolores Park and the\r\nMission its name. Holding hands, moving quickly, we crossed to the\r\nchurch. It had big pillars in front of it. She put my back up against\r\none of them and pulled my face down to hers again. My hands went\r\nquickly and boldly back to her shirt. I slipped them up her front.\r\n\r\n\"It undoes in the back,\" she whispered into my mouth. I had a boner\r\nthat could cut glass. I moved my hands around to her back, which was\r\nstrong and broad, and found the hook with my fingers, which were\r\ntrembling. I fumbled for a while, thinking of all those jokes about how\r\nbad guys are at undoing bras. I was bad at it. Then the hook sprang\r\nfree. She gasped into my mouth. I slipped my hands around, feeling the\r\nwetness of her armpits -- which was sexy and not at all gross for some\r\nreason -- and then brushed the sides of her breasts.\r\n\r\nThat's when the sirens started.\r\n\r\nThey were louder than anything I'd ever heard. A sound like a physical\r\nsensation, like something blowing you off your feet. A sound as loud as\r\nyour ears could process, and then louder.\r\n\r\n\"DISPERSE IMMEDIATELY,\" a voice said, like God rattling in my skull.\r\n\r\n\"THIS IS AN ILLEGAL GATHERING. DISPERSE IMMEDIATELY.\"\r\n\r\nThe band had stopped playing. The noise of the crowd across the street\r\nchanged. It got scared. Angry.\r\n\r\nI heard a click as the PA system of car-speakers and car-batteries in\r\nthe tennis courts powered up.\r\n\r\n\"TAKE IT BACK!\"\r\n\r\nIt was a defiant yell, like a sound shouted into the surf or screamed\r\noff a cliff.\r\n\r\n\"TAKE IT BACK!\"\r\n\r\nThe crowd *growled*, a sound that made the hairs on the back of my neck\r\nstand up.\r\n\r\n\"*TAKE IT BACK*!\" they chanted. \"TAKE IT BACK TAKE IT BACK TAKE IT\r\nBACK!\"\r\n\r\nThe police moved in in lines, carrying plastic shields, wearing Darth\r\nVader helmets that covered their faces. Each one had a black truncheon\r\nand infra-red goggles. They looked like soldiers out of some futuristic\r\nwar movie. They took a step forward in unison and every one of them\r\nbanged his truncheon on his shield, a cracking noise like the earth\r\nsplitting. Another step, another crack. They were all around the park\r\nand closing in now.\r\n\r\n\"DISPERSE IMMEDIATELY,\" the voice of God said again. There were\r\nhelicopters overhead now. No floodlights, though. The infrared goggles,\r\nright. Of course. They'd have infrared scopes in the sky, too. I pulled\r\nAnge back against the doorway of the church, tucking us back from the\r\ncops and the choppers.\r\n\r\n\"TAKE IT BACK!\" the PA roared. It was Trudy Doo's rebel yell and I\r\nheard her guitar thrash out some chords, then her drummer playing, then\r\nthat big deep bass.\r\n\r\n\"TAKE IT BACK!\" the crowd answered, and they boiled out of the park at\r\nthe police lines.\r\n\r\nI've never been in a war, but now I think I know what it must be like.\r\nWhat it must be like when scared kids charge across a field at an\r\nopposing force, knowing what's coming, running anyway, screaming,\r\nhollering.\r\n\r\n\"DISPERSE IMMEDIATELY,\" the voice of God said. It was coming from\r\ntrucks parked all around the park, trucks that had swung into place in\r\nthe last few seconds.\r\n\r\nThat's when the mist fell. It came out of the choppers, and we just\r\ncaught the edge of it. It made the top of my head feel like it was\r\ngoing to come off. It made my sinuses feel like they were being\r\npunctured with ice-picks. It made my eyes swell and water, and my\r\nthroat close.\r\n\r\nPepper spray. Not 200 thousand Scovilles. A million and a half. They'd\r\ngassed the crowd.\r\n\r\nI didn't see what happened next, but I heard it, over the sound of both\r\nme and Ange choking and holding each other. First the choking, retching\r\nsounds. The guitar and drums and bass crashed to a halt. Then coughing.\r\n\r\nThen screaming.\r\n\r\nThe screaming went on for a long time. When I could see again, the cops\r\nhad their scopes up on their foreheads and the choppers were flooding\r\nDolores Park with so much light it looked like daylight. Everyone was\r\nlooking at the Park, which was good news, because when the lights went\r\nup like that, we were totally visible.\r\n\r\n\"What do we do?\" Ange said. Her voice was tight, scared. I didn't trust\r\nmyself to speak for a moment. I swallowed a few times.\r\n\r\n\"We walk away,\" I said. \"That's all we can do. Walk away. Like we were\r\njust passing by. Down to Dolores and turn left and up towards 16th\r\nStreet. Like we're just passing by. Like this is none of our business.\"\r\n\r\n\"That'll never work,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"It's all I've got.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't think we should try to run for it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said. \"If we run, they'll chase us. Maybe if we walk, they'll\r\nfigure we haven't done anything and let us alone. They have a lot of\r\narrests to make. They'll be busy for a long time.\"\r\n\r\nThe park was rolling with bodies, people and adults clawing at their\r\nfaces and gasping. The cops dragged them by the armpits, then lashed\r\ntheir wrists with plastic cuffs and tossed them into the trucks like\r\nrag-dolls.\r\n\r\n\"OK?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"OK,\" she said.\r\n\r\nAnd that's just what we did. Walked, holding hands, quickly and\r\nbusiness-like, like two people wanting to avoid whatever trouble\r\nsomeone else was making. The kind of walk you adopt when you want to\r\npretend you can't see a panhandler, or don't want to get involved in a\r\nstreet-fight.\r\n\r\nIt worked.\r\n\r\nWe reached the corner and turned and kept going. Neither of us dared to\r\nspeak for two blocks. Then I let out a gasp of air I hadn't know I'd\r\nbeen holding in.\r\n\r\nWe came to 16th Street and turned down toward Mission Street. Normally\r\nthat's a pretty scary neighborhood at 2AM on a Saturday night. That\r\nnight it was a relief -- same old druggies and hookers and dealers and\r\ndrunks. No cops with truncheons, no gas.\r\n\r\n\"Um,\" I said as we breathed in the night air. \"Coffee?\"\r\n\r\n\"Home,\" she said. \"I think home for now. Coffee later.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" I agreed. She lived up in Hayes Valley. I spotted a taxi\r\nrolling by and I hailed it. That was a small miracle -- there are\r\nhardly any cabs when you need them in San Francisco.\r\n\r\n\"Have you got cabfare home?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" she said. The cab-driver looked at us through his window. I\r\nopened the back door so he wouldn't take off.\r\n\r\n\"Good night,\" I said.\r\n\r\nShe put her hands behind my head and pulled my face toward her. She\r\nkissed me hard on the mouth, nothing sexual in it, but somehow more\r\nintimate for that.\r\n\r\n\"Good night,\" she whispered in my ear, and slipped into the taxi.\r\n\r\nHead swimming, eyes running, a burning shame for having left all those\r\nXnetters to the tender mercies of the DHS and the SFPD, I set off for\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMonday morning, Fred Benson was standing behind Ms Galvez's desk.\r\n\r\n\"Ms Galvez will no longer be teaching this class,\" he said, once we'd\r\ntaken our seats. He had a self-satisfied note that I recognized\r\nimmediately. On a hunch, I checked out Charles. He was smiling like it\r\nwas his birthday and he'd been given the best present in the world.\r\n\r\nI put my hand up.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's Board policy not to discuss employee matters with anyone except\r\nthe employee and the disciplinary committee,\" he said, without even\r\nbothering to hide how much he enjoyed saying it.\r\n\r\n\"We'll be beginning a new unit today, on national security. Your\r\nSchoolBooks have the new texts. Please open them and turn to the first\r\nscreen.\"\r\n\r\nThe opening screen was emblazoned with a DHS logo and the title: WHAT\r\nEVERY AMERICAN SHOULD KNOW ABOUT HOMELAND SECURITY.\r\n\r\nI wanted to throw my SchoolBook on the floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd made arrangements to meet Ange at a cafe in her neighborhood after\r\nschool. I jumped on the BART and found myself sitting behind two guys\r\nin suits. They were looking at the San Francisco Chronicle, which\r\nfeatured a full-page post-mortem on the \"youth riot\" in Mission Dolores\r\nPark. They were tutting and clucking over it. Then one said to the\r\nother, \"It's like they're brainwashed or something. Christ, were we\r\never that stupid?\"\r\n\r\nI got up and moved to another seat.\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nChapter 13\r\n\r\n[[This chapter is dedicated to Books-A-Million, a chain of gigantic\r\nbookstores spread across the USA. I first encountered Books-A-Million\r\nwhile staying at a hotel in Terre Haute, Indiana (I was giving a speech\r\nat the Rose Hulman Institute of Technology later that day). The store\r\nwas next to my hotel and I really needed some reading material -- I'd\r\nbeen on the road for a solid month and I'd read everything in my\r\nsuitcase, and I had another five cities to go before I headed home. As\r\nI stared intently at the shelves, a clerk asked me if I needed any\r\nhelp. Now, I've worked at bookstores before, and a knowledgeable clerk\r\nis worth her weight in gold, so I said sure, and started to describe my\r\ntastes, naming authors I'd enjoyed. The clerk smiled and said, \"I've\r\ngot just the book for you,\" and proceeded to take down a copy of my\r\nfirst novel, Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom. I busted out laughing,\r\nintroduced myself, and had an absolutely lovely chat about science\r\nfiction that almost made me late to give my speech!]]\r\n\r\n[[Books-A-Million\r\nhttp://www.booksamillion.com/ncom/books?&isbn=0765319853]]\r\n\r\n\"They're total whores,\" Ange said, spitting the word out. \"In fact,\r\nthat's an insult to hardworking whores everywhere. They're, they're\r\n*profiteers.*\"\r\n\r\nWe were looking at a stack of newspapers we'd picked up and brought to\r\nthe cafe. They all contained \"reporting\" on the party in Dolores Park\r\nand to a one, they made it sound like a drunken, druggy orgy of kids\r\nwho'd attacked the cops. *USA Today* described the cost of the \"riot\"\r\nand included the cost of washing away the pepper-spray residue from the\r\ngas-bombing, the rash of asthma attacks that clogged the city's\r\nemergency rooms, and the cost of processing the eight hundred arrested\r\n\"rioters.\"\r\n\r\nNo one was telling our side.\r\n\r\n\"Well, the Xnet got it right, anyway,\" I said. I'd saved a bunch of the\r\nblogs and videos and photostreams to my phone and I showed them to her.\r\nThey were first-hand accounts from people who'd been gassed, and beaten\r\nup. The video showed us all dancing, having fun, showed the peaceful\r\npolitical speeches and the chant of \"Take It Back\" and Trudy Doo\r\ntalking about us being the only generation that could believe in\r\nfighting for our freedoms.\r\n\r\n\"We need to make people know about this,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" I said, glumly. \"That's a nice theory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, why do you think the press doesn't ever publish our side?\"\r\n\r\n\"You said it, they're whores.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, but whores do it for the money. They could sell more papers and\r\ncommercials if they had a controversy. All they have now is a crime --\r\ncontroversy is much bigger.\"\r\n\r\n\"OK, point taken. So why don't they do it? Well, reporters can barely\r\nsearch regular blogs, let alone keep track of the Xnet. It's not as if\r\nthat's a real adult-friendly place to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" she said. \"Well, we can fix that, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Huh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Write it all up. Put it in one place, with all the links. A single\r\nplace where you can go that's intended for the press to find it and get\r\nthe whole picture. Link it to the HOWTOs for Xnet. Internet users can\r\nget to the Xnet, provided they don't care about the DHS finding out\r\nwhat they've been surfing.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think it'll work?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, even if it doesn't, it's something positive to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why would they listen to us, anyway?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who wouldn't listen to M1k3y?\"\r\n\r\nI put down my coffee. I picked up my phone and slipped it into my\r\npocket. I stood up, turned on my heel, and walked out of the cafe. I\r\npicked a direction at random and kept going. My face felt tight, the\r\nblood gone into my stomach, which churned.\r\n\r\n*They know who you are,* I thought. *They know who M1k3y is.* That was\r\nit. If Ange had figured it out, the DHS had too. I was doomed. I had\r\nknown that since they let me go from the DHS truck, that someday they'd\r\ncome and arrest me and put me away forever, send me to wherever Darryl\r\nhad gone.\r\n\r\nIt was all over.\r\n\r\nShe nearly tackled me as I reached Market Street. She was out of breath\r\nand looked furious.\r\n\r\n\"What the *hell* is your problem, mister?\"\r\n\r\nI shook her off and kept walking. It was all over.\r\n\r\nShe grabbed me again. \"Stop it, Marcus, you're scaring me. Come on,\r\ntalk to me.\"\r\n\r\nI stopped and looked at her. She blurred before my eyes. I couldn't\r\nfocus on anything. I had a mad desire to jump into the path of a Muni\r\ntrolley as it tore past us, down the middle of the road. Better to die\r\nthan to go back.\r\n\r\n\"Marcus!\" She did something I'd only seen people do in the movies. She\r\nslapped me, a hard crack across the face. \"Talk to me, dammit!\"\r\n\r\nI looked at her and put my hand to my face, which was stinging hard.\r\n\r\n\"No one is supposed to know who I am,\" I said. \"I can't put it any more\r\nsimply. If you know, it's all over. Once other people know, it's all\r\nover.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh god, I'm sorry. Look, I only know because, well, because I\r\nblackmailed Jolu. After the party I stalked you a little, trying to\r\nfigure out if you were the nice guy you seemed to be or a secret\r\naxe-murderer. I've known Jolu for a long time and when I asked him\r\nabout you, he gushed like you were the Second Coming or something, but\r\nI could hear that there was something he wasn't telling me. I've known\r\nJolu for a long time. He dated my older sister at computer camp when he\r\nwas a kid. I have some really good dirt on him. I told him I'd go\r\npublic with it if he didn't tell me.\"\r\n\r\n\"So he told you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she said. \"He told me to go to hell. Then I told him something\r\nabout me. Something I'd never told anyone else.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at me. Looked around. Looked back at me. \"OK. I won't swear\r\nyou to secrecy because what's the point? Either I can trust you or I\r\ncan't.\r\n\r\n\"Last year, I --\" she broke off. \"Last year, I stole the standardized\r\ntests and published them on the net. It was just a lark. I happened to\r\nbe walking past the principal's office and I saw them in his safe, and\r\nthe door was hanging open. I ducked into his office -- there were six\r\nsets of copies and I just put one into my bag and took off again. When\r\nI got home, I scanned them all and put them up on a Pirate Party server\r\nin Denmark.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was *you*?\" I said.\r\n\r\nShe blushed. \"Um. Yeah.\"\r\n\r\n\"Holy crap!\" I said. It had been huge news. The Board of Education said\r\nthat its No Child Left Behind tests had cost tens of millions of\r\ndollars to produce and that they'd have to spend it all over again now\r\nthat they'd had the leak. They called it \"edu-terrorism.\" The news had\r\nspeculated endlessly about the political motivations of the leaker,\r\nwondering if it was a teacher's protest, or a student, or a thief, or a\r\ndisgruntled government contractor.\r\n\r\n\"That was YOU?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was me,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"And you told Jolu this --\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I wanted him to be sure that I would keep the secret. If he\r\nknew *my* secret, then he'd have something he could use to put me in\r\njail if I opened my trap. Give a little, get a little. Quid pro quo,\r\nlike in Silence of the Lambs.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he told you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she said. \"He didn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"But --\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I told him how into you I was. How I was planning to totally make\r\nan idiot of myself and throw myself at you. *Then* he told me.\"\r\n\r\nI couldn't think of anything to say then. I looked down at my toes. She\r\ngrabbed my hands and squeezed them.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry I squeezed it out of him. It was your decision to tell me,\r\nif you were going to tell me at all. I had no business --\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said. Now that I knew how she'd found out, I was starting to\r\ncalm down. \"No, it's good you know. *You*.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me,\" she said. \"Li'l ol' me.\"\r\n\r\n\"OK, I can live with this. But there's one other thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no way to say this without sounding like a jerk, so I'll just\r\nsay it. People who date each other -- or whatever it is we're doing now\r\n-- they split up. When they split up, they get angry at each other.\r\nSometimes even hate each other. It's really cold to think about that\r\nhappening between us, but you know, we've got to think about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I solemnly promise that there is nothing you could ever do to me that\r\nwould cause me to betray your secret. Nothing. Screw a dozen\r\ncheerleaders in my bed while my mother watches. Make me listen to\r\nBritney Spears. Rip off my laptop, smash it with hammers and soak it in\r\nsea-water. I promise. Nothing. Ever.\"\r\n\r\nI whooshed out some air.\r\n\r\n\"Um,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Now would be a good time to kiss me,\" she said, and turned her face\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nM1k3y's next big project on the Xnet was putting together the ultimate\r\nroundup of reports of the DON'T TRUST party at Dolores Park. I put\r\ntogether the biggest, most bad-ass site I could, with sections showing\r\nthe action by location, by time, by category -- police violence,\r\ndancing, aftermath, singing. I uploaded the whole concert.\r\n\r\nIt was pretty much all I worked on for the rest of the night. And the\r\nnext night. And the next.\r\n\r\nMy mailbox overflowed with suggestions from people. They sent me dumps\r\noff their phones and their pocket-cameras. Then I got an email from a\r\nname I recognized -- Dr Eeevil (three \"e\"s), one of the prime\r\nmaintainers of ParanoidLinux.\r\n\r\n> M1k3y\r\n\r\n> I have been watching your Xnet experiment with great interest. Here\r\n> in Germany, we have much experience with what happens with a\r\n> government that gets out of control. \r\n\r\n> One thing you should know is that every camera has a unique \"noise\r\n> signature\" that can be used to later connect a picture with a camera.\r\n> That means that the photos you're republishing on your site could\r\n> potentially be used to identify the photographers, should they later\r\n> be picked up for something else.\r\n\r\n> Luckily, it's not hard to strip out the signatures, if you care to.\r\n> There's a utility on the ParanoidLinux distro you're using that does\r\n> this -- it's called photonomous, and you'll find it in /usr/bin. Just\r\n> read the man pages for documentation. It's simple though.\r\n\r\n> Good luck with what you're doing. Don't get caught. Stay free. Stay\r\n> paranoid.\r\n\r\n> Dr Eeevil\r\n\r\nI de-fingerprintized all the photos I'd posted and put them back up,\r\nalong with a note explaining what Dr Eeevil had told me, warning\r\neveryone else to do the same. We all had the same basic ParanoidXbox\r\ninstall, so we could all anonymize our pictures. There wasn't anything\r\nI could do about the photos that had already been downloaded and\r\ncached, but from now on we'd be smarter.\r\n\r\nThat was all the thought I gave the matter that night, until I got down\r\nto breakfast the next morning and Mom had the radio on, playing the NPR\r\nmorning news.\r\n\r\n\"Arabic news agency Al-Jazeera is running pictures, video and\r\nfirst-hand accounts of last weekend's youth riot in Mission Dolores\r\npark,\" the announcer said as I was drinking a glass of orange juice. I\r\nmanaged not to spray it across the room, but I *did* choke a little.\r\n\r\n\"Al-Jazeera reporters claim that these accounts were published on the\r\nso-called 'Xnet,' a clandestine network used by students and Al-Quaeda\r\nsympathizers in the Bay Area. This network's existence has long been\r\nrumored, but today marks its first mainstream mention.\"\r\n\r\nMom shook her head. \"Just what we need,\" she said. \"As if the police\r\nweren't bad enough. Kids running around, pretending to be guerrillas\r\nand giving them the excuse to really crack down.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Xnet weblogs have carried hundreds of reports and multimedia files\r\nfrom young people who attended the riot and allege that they were\r\ngathered peacefully until the police attacked *them*. Here is one of\r\nthose accounts.\r\n\r\n\"'All we were doing was dancing. I brought my little brother. Bands\r\nplayed and we talked about freedom, about how we were losing it to\r\nthese jerks who say they hate terrorists but who attack us though we're\r\nnot terrorists we're Americans. I think they hate freedom, not us.\r\n\r\n\"We danced and the bands played and it was all fun and good and then\r\nthe cops started shouting at us to disperse. We all shouted take it\r\nback! Meaning take America back. The cops gassed us with pepper spray.\r\nMy little brother is twelve. He missed three days of school. My stupid\r\nparents say it was my fault. How about the police? We pay them and\r\nthey're supposed to protect us but they gassed us for no good reason,\r\ngassed us like they gas enemy soldiers.'\r\n\r\n\"Similar accounts, including audio and video, can be found on\r\nAl-Jazeera's website and on the Xnet. You can find directions for\r\naccessing this Xnet on NPR's homepage.\"\r\n\r\nDad came down.\r\n\r\n\"Do you use the Xnet?\" he said. He looked intensely at my face. I felt\r\nmyself squirm.\r\n\r\n\"It's for video-games,\" I said. \"That's what most people use it for.\r\nIt's just a wireless network. It's what everyone did with those free\r\nXboxes they gave away last year.\"\r\n\r\nHe glowered at me. \"Games? Marcus, you don't realize it, but you're\r\nproviding cover for people who plan on attacking and destroying this\r\ncountry. I don't want to see you using this Xnet. Not anymore. Do I\r\nmake myself clear?\"\r\n\r\nI wanted to argue. Hell, I wanted to shake him by the shoulders. But I\r\ndidn't. I looked away. I said, \"Sure, Dad.\" I went to school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first I was relieved when I discovered that they weren't going to\r\nleave Mr Benson in charge of my social studies class. But the woman\r\nthey found to replace him was my worst nightmare.\r\n\r\nShe was young, just about 28 or 29, and pretty, in a wholesome kind of\r\nway. She was blonde and spoke with a soft southern accent when she\r\nintroduced herself to us as Mrs Andersen. That set off alarm bells\r\nright away. I didn't know *any* women under the age of sixty that\r\ncalled themselves \"Mrs.\"\r\n\r\nBut I was prepared to overlook it. She was young, pretty, she sounded\r\nnice. She would be OK.\r\n\r\nShe wasn't OK.\r\n\r\n\"Under what circumstances should the federal government be prepared to\r\nsuspend the Bill of Rights?\" she said, turning to the blackboard and\r\nwriting down a row of numbers, one through ten.\r\n\r\n\"Never,\" I said, not waiting to be called on. This was easy.\r\n\"Constitutional rights are absolute.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's not a very sophisticated view.\" She looked at her seating-plan.\r\n\"Marcus. For example, say a policeman conducts an improper search -- he\r\ngoes beyond the stuff specified in his warrant. He discovers compelling\r\nevidence that a bad guy killed your father. It's the only evidence that\r\nexists. Should the bad guy go free?\"\r\n\r\nI knew the answer to this, but I couldn't really explain it. \"Yes,\" I\r\nsaid, finally. \"But the police shouldn't conduct improper searches --\"\r\n\r\n\"Wrong,\" she said. \"The proper response to police misconduct is\r\ndisciplinary action against the police, not punishing all of society\r\nfor one cop's mistake.\" She wrote \"Criminal guilt\" under point one on\r\nthe board.\r\n\r\n\"Other ways in which the Bill of Rights can be superseded?\"\r\n\r\nCharles put his hand up. \"Shouting fire in a crowded theater?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good --\" she consulted the seating plan -- \"Charles. There are\r\nmany instances in which the First Amendment is not absolute. Let's list\r\nsome more of those.\"\r\n\r\nCharles put his hand up again. \"Endangering a law enforcement officer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, disclosing the identity of an undercover policeman or\r\nintelligence officer. Very good.\" She wrote it down. \"Others?\"\r\n\r\n\"National security,\" Charles said, not waiting for her to call on him\r\nagain. \"Libel. Obscenity. Corruption of minors. Child porn. Bomb-making\r\nrecipes.\" Mrs Andersen wrote these down fast, but stopped at child\r\nporn. \"Child porn is just a form of obscenity.\"\r\n\r\nI was feeling sick. This was not what I'd learned or believed about my\r\ncountry. I put my hand up.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Marcus?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't get it. You're making it sound like the Bill of Rights is\r\noptional. It's the Constitution. We're supposed to follow it\r\nabsolutely.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a common oversimplification,\" she said, giving me a fake smile.\r\n\"But the fact of the matter is that the framers of the Constitution\r\nintended it to be a living document that was revised over time. They\r\nunderstood that the Republic wouldn't be able to last forever if the\r\ngovernment of the day couldn't govern according to the needs of the\r\nday. They never intended the Constitution to be looked on like\r\nreligious doctrine. After all, they came here fleeing religious\r\ndoctrine.\"\r\n\r\nI shook my head. \"What? No. They were merchants and artisans who were\r\nloyal to the King until he instituted policies that were against their\r\ninterests and enforced them brutally. The religious refugees were way\r\nearlier.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some of the Framers were descended from religious refugees,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"And the Bill of Rights isn't supposed to be something you pick and\r\nchoose from. What the Framers hated was tyranny. That's what the Bill\r\nof Rights is supposed to prevent. They were a revolutionary army and\r\nthey wanted a set of principles that everyone could agree to. Life,\r\nliberty and the pursuit of happiness. The right of people to throw off\r\ntheir oppressors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" she said, waving at me. \"They believed in the right of\r\npeople to get rid of their Kings, but --\" Charles was grinning and when\r\nshe said that, he smiled even wider.\r\n\r\n\"They set out the Bill of Rights because they thought that having\r\nabsolute rights was better than the risk that someone would take them\r\naway. Like the First Amendment: it's supposed to protect us by\r\npreventing the government from creating two kinds of speech, allowed\r\nspeech and criminal speech. They didn't want to face the risk that some\r\njerk would decide that the things that he found unpleasant were\r\nillegal.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned and wrote, \"Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\" on\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"We're getting a little ahead of the lesson, but you seem like an\r\nadvanced group.\" The others laughed at this, nervously.\r\n\r\n\"The role of government is to secure for citizens the rights of life,\r\nliberty and the pursuit of happiness. In that order. It's like a\r\nfilter. If the government wants to do something that makes us a little\r\nunhappy, or takes away some of our liberty, it's OK, providing they're\r\ndoing it to save our lives. That's why the cops can lock you up if they\r\nthink you're a danger to yourself or others. You lose your liberty and\r\nhappiness to protect life. If you've got life, you might get liberty\r\nand happiness later.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the others had their hands up. \"Doesn't that mean that they can\r\ndo anything they want, if they say it's to stop someone from hurting us\r\nin the future?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" another kid said. \"This sounds like you're saying that national\r\nsecurity is more important than the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nI was so proud of my fellow students then. I said, \"How can you protect\r\nfreedom by suspending the Bill of Rights?\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head at us like we were being very stupid. \"The\r\n'revolutionary' founding fathers *shot traitors* and spies. They didn't\r\nbelieve in absolute freedom, not when it threatened the Republic. Now\r\nyou take these Xnet people --\"\r\n\r\nI tried hard not to stiffen.\r\n\r\n\"-- these so-called jammers who were on the news this morning. After\r\nthis city was attacked by people who've declared war on this country,\r\nthey set about sabotaging the security measures set up to catch the bad\r\nguys and prevent them from doing it again. They did this by endangering\r\nand inconveniencing their fellow citizens --\"\r\n\r\n\"They did it to show that our rights were being taken away in the name\r\nof protecting them!\" I said. OK, I shouted. God, she had me so steamed.\r\n\"They did it because the government was treating *everyone* like a\r\nsuspected terrorist.\"\r\n\r\n\"So they wanted to prove that they shouldn't be treated like\r\nterrorists,\" Charles shouted back, \"so they acted like terrorists? So\r\nthey committed terrorism?\"\r\n\r\nI boiled.\r\n\r\n\"Oh for Christ's sake. Committed terrorism? They showed that universal\r\nsurveillance was more dangerous than terrorism. Look at what happened\r\nin the park last weekend. Those people were dancing and listening to\r\nmusic. How is *that* terrorism?\"\r\n\r\nThe teacher crossed the room and stood before me, looming over me until\r\nI shut up. \"Marcus, you seem to think that nothing has changed in this\r\ncountry. You need to understand that the bombing of the Bay Bridge\r\nchanged everything. Thousands of our friends and relatives lie dead at\r\nthe bottom of the Bay. This is a time for national unity in the face of\r\nthe violent insult our country has suffered --\"\r\n\r\nI stood up. I'd had enough of this \"everything has changed\" crapola.\r\n\"National unity? The whole point of America is that we're the country\r\nwhere dissent is welcome. We're a country of dissidents and fighters\r\nand university dropouts and free speech people.\"\r\n\r\nI thought of Ms Galvez's last lesson and the thousands of Berkeley\r\nstudents who'd surrounded the police-van when they tried to arrest a\r\nguy for distributing civil rights literature. No one tried to stop\r\nthose trucks when they drove away with all the people who'd been\r\ndancing in the park. I didn't try. I was running away.\r\n\r\nMaybe everything *had* changed.\r\n\r\n\"I believe you know where Mr Benson's office is,\" she said to me. \"You\r\nare to present yourself to him immediately. I will *not* have my\r\nclasses disrupted by disrespectful behavior. For someone who claims to\r\nlove freedom of speech, you're certainly willing to shout down anyone\r\nwho disagrees with you.\"\r\n\r\nI picked up my SchoolBook and my bag and stormed out. The door had a\r\ngas-lift, so it was impossible to slam, or I would have slammed it.\r\n\r\nI went fast to Mr Benson's office. Cameras filmed me as I went. My gait\r\nwas recorded. The arphids in my student ID broadcast my identity to\r\nsensors in the hallway. It was like being in jail.\r\n\r\n\"Close the door, Marcus,\" Mr Benson said. He turned his screen around\r\nso that I could see the video feed from the social studies classroom.\r\nHe'd been watching.\r\n\r\n\"What do you have to say for yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"That wasn't teaching, it was *propaganda*. She told us that the\r\nConstitution didn't matter!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, she said it wasn't religious doctrine. And you attacked her like\r\nsome kind of fundamentalist, proving her point. Marcus, you of all\r\npeople should understand that everything changed when the bridge was\r\nbombed. Your friend Darryl --\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you say a goddamned word about him,\" I said, the anger bubbling\r\nover. \"You're not fit to talk about him. Yeah, I understand that\r\neverything's different now. We used to be a free country. Now we're\r\nnot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Marcus, do you know what 'zero-tolerance' means?\"\r\n\r\nI backed down. He could expel me for \"threatening behavior.\" It was\r\nsupposed to be used against gang kids who tried to intimidate their\r\nteachers. But of course he wouldn't have any compunctions about using\r\nit on me.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"I know what it means.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you owe me an apology,\" he said.\r\n\r\nI looked at him. He was barely suppressing his sadistic smile. A part\r\nof me wanted to grovel. It wanted to beg for his forgiveness for all my\r\nshame. I tamped that part down and decided that I would rather get\r\nkicked out than apologize.\r\n\r\n\"Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from\r\nthe consent of the governed, that whenever any form of government\r\nbecomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to\r\nalter or abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its\r\nfoundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form,\r\nas to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and\r\nhappiness.\" I remembered it word for word.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. \"Remembering things isn't the same as understanding\r\nthem, sonny.\" He bent over his computer and made some clicks. His\r\nprinter purred. He handed me a sheet of warm Board letterhead that said\r\nI'd been suspended for two weeks.\r\n\r\n\"I'll email your parents now. If you are still on school property in\r\nthirty minutes, you'll be arrested for trespassing.\"\r\n\r\nI looked at him.\r\n\r\n\"You don't want to declare war on me in my own school,\" he said. \"You\r\ncan't win that war. GO!\"\r\n\r\nI left.\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nChapter 14\r\n\r\n[[This chapter is dedicated to the incomparable Mysterious Galaxy in\r\nSan Diego, California.

I had the piece of paper folded in\r\nthe back pocket of my jeans, and I threw it on the kitchen table when I\r\ngot home. I sat down in the living room and switched on the TV. I never\r\nwatched it, but I knew that my parents did. The TV and the radio and\r\nthe newspapers were where they got all their ideas about the world.\r\n\r\nThe news was terrible. There were so many reasons to be scared.\r\nAmerican soldiers were dying all over the world. Not just soldiers,\r\neither. National guardsmen, who thought they were signing up to help\r\nrescue people from hurricanes, stationed overseas for years and years\r\nof a long and endless war.\r\n\r\nI flipped around the 24-hour news networks, one after another, a parade\r\nof officials telling us why we should be scared. A parade of photos of\r\nbombs going off around the world.\r\n\r\nI kept flipping and found myself looking at a familiar face. It was the\r\nguy who had come into the truck and spoken to Severe-Haircut woman when\r\nI was chained up in the back. Wearing a military uniform. The caption\r\nidentified him as Major General Graeme Sutherland, Regional Commander,\r\nDHS.\r\n\r\n\"I hold in my hands actual literature on offer at the so-called concert\r\nin Dolores Park last weekend.\" He held up a stack of pamphlets. There'd\r\nbeen lots of pamphleteers there, I remembered. Wherever you got a group\r\nof people in San Francisco, you got pamphlets.\r\n\r\n\"I want you to look at these for a moment. Let me read you their\r\ntitles. WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED: A CITIZEN'S GUIDE TO\r\nOVERTHROWING THE STATE. Here's one, DID THE SEPTEMBER 11TH BOMBINGS\r\nREALLY HAPPEN? And another, HOW TO USE THEIR SECURITY AGAINST THEM.\r\nThis literature shows us the true purpose of the illegal gathering on\r\nSaturday night. This wasn't merely an unsafe gathering of thousands of\r\npeople without proper precaution, or even toilets. It was a recruiting\r\nrally for the enemy. It was an attempt to corrupt children into\r\nembracing the idea that America shouldn't protect herself.\r\n\r\n\"Take this slogan, DON'T TRUST ANYONE OVER 25. What better way to\r\nensure that no considered, balanced, adult discussion is ever injected\r\ninto your pro-terrorist message than to exclude adults, limiting your\r\ngroup to impressionable young people?\r\n\r\n\"When police came on the scene, they found a recruitment rally for\r\nAmerica's enemies in progress. The gathering had already disrupted the\r\nnights of hundreds of residents in the area, none of whom had been\r\nconsulted in the planning of this all night rave party.\r\n\r\n\"They ordered these people to disperse -- that much is visible on all\r\nthe video -- and when the revelers turned to attack them, egged on by\r\nthe musicians on stage, the police subdued them using non-lethal crowd\r\ncontrol techniques.\r\n\r\n\"The arrestees were ring-leaders and provocateurs who had led the\r\nthousands of impressionistic young people there to charge the police\r\nlines. 827 of them were taken into custody. Many of these people had\r\nprior offenses. More than 100 of them had outstanding warrants. They\r\nare still in custody.\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, America is fighting a war on many fronts, but\r\nnowhere is she in more grave danger than she is here, at home. Whether\r\nwe are being attacked by terrorists or those who sympathize with them.\"\r\n\r\nA reporter held up a hand and said, \"General Sutherland, surely you're\r\nnot saying that these children were terrorist sympathizers for\r\nattending a party in a park?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not. But when young people are brought under the influence\r\nof our country's enemies, it's easy for them to end up over their\r\nheads. Terrorists would love to recruit a fifth column to fight the war\r\non the home front for them. If these were my children, I'd be gravely\r\nconcerned.\"\r\n\r\nAnother reporter chimed in. \"Surely this is just an open air concert,\r\nGeneral? They were hardly drilling with rifles.\"\r\n\r\nThe General produced a stack of photos and began to hold them up.\r\n\"These are pictures that officers took with infra-red cameras before\r\nmoving in.\" He held them next to his face and paged through them one at\r\na time. They showed people dancing really rough, some people getting\r\ncrushed or stepped on. Then they moved into sex stuff by the trees, a\r\ngirl with three guys, two guys necking together. \"There were children\r\nas young as ten years old at this event. A deadly cocktail of drugs,\r\npropaganda and music resulted in dozens of injuries. It's a wonder\r\nthere weren't any deaths.\"\r\n\r\nI switched the TV off. They made it look like it had been a riot. If my\r\nparents thought I'd been there, they'd have strapped me to my bed for a\r\nmonth and only let me out afterward wearing a tracking collar.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, they were going to be *pissed* when they found out\r\nI'd been suspended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey didn't take it well. Dad wanted to ground me, but Mom and I talked\r\nhim out of it.\r\n\r\n\"You know that vice-principal has had it in for Marcus for years,\" Mom\r\nsaid. \"The last time we met him you cursed him for an hour afterward. I\r\nthink the word 'asshole' was mentioned repeatedly.\"\r\n\r\nDad shook his head. \"Disrupting a class to argue against the Department\r\nof Homeland Security --\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a social studies class, Dad,\" I said. I was beyond caring\r\nanymore, but I felt like if Mom was going to stick up for me, I should\r\nhelp her out. \"We were talking about the DHS. Isn't debate supposed to\r\nbe healthy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look, son,\" he said. He'd taking to calling me \"son\" a lot. It made me\r\nfeel like he'd stopped thinking of me as a person and switched to\r\nthinking of me as a kind of half-formed larva that needed to be guided\r\nout of adolescence. I hated it. \"You're going to have to learn to live\r\nwith the fact that we live in a different world today. You have every\r\nright to speak your mind of course, but you have to be prepared for the\r\nconsequences of doing so. You have to face the fact that there are\r\npeople who are hurting, who aren't going to want to argue the finer\r\npoints of Constitutional law when their lives are at stake. We're in a\r\nlifeboat now, and once you're in the lifeboat, no one wants to hear\r\nabout how mean the captain is being.\"\r\n\r\nI barely restrained myself from rolling my eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I've been assigned two weeks of independent study, writing one paper\r\nfor each of my subjects, using the city for my background -- a history\r\npaper, a social studies paper, an English paper, a physics paper. It\r\nbeats sitting around at home watching television.\"\r\n\r\nDad looked hard at me, like he suspected I was up to something, then\r\nnodded. I said goodnight to them and went up to my room. I fired up my\r\nXbox and opened a word-processor and started to brainstorm ideas for my\r\npapers. Why not? It really was better than sitting around at home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI ended up IMing with Ange for quite a while that night. She was\r\nsympathetic about everything and told me she'd help me with my papers\r\nif I wanted to meet her after school the next night. I knew where her\r\nschool was -- she went to the same school as Van -- and it was all the\r\nway over in the East Bay, where I hadn't visited since the bombs went.\r\n\r\nI was really excited at the prospect of seeing her again. Every night\r\nsince the party, I'd gone to bed thinking of two things: the sight of\r\nthe crowd charging the police lines and the feeling of the side of her\r\nbreast under her shirt as we leaned against the pillar. She was\r\namazing. I'd never been with a girl as...aggressive as her before. It\r\nhad always been me putting the moves on and them pushing me away. I got\r\nthe feeling that Ange was as much of a horn-dog as I was. It was a\r\ntantalizing notion.\r\n\r\nI slept soundly that night, with exciting dreams of me and Ange and\r\nwhat we might do if we found ourselves in a secluded spot somewhere.\r\n\r\nThe next day, I set out to work on my papers. San Francisco is a good\r\nplace to write about. History? Sure, it's there, from the Gold Rush to\r\nthe WWII shipyards, the Japanese internment camps, the invention of the\r\nPC. Physics? The Exploratorium has the coolest exhibits of any museum\r\nI've ever been to. I took a perverse satisfaction in the exhibits on\r\nsoil liquefaction during big quakes. English? Jack London, Beat Poets,\r\nscience fiction writers like Pat Murphy and Rudy Rucker. Social\r\nstudies? The Free Speech Movement, Cesar Chavez, gay rights, feminism,\r\nanti-war movement...\r\n\r\nI've always loved just learning stuff for its own sake. Just to be\r\nsmarter about the world around me. I could do that just by walking\r\naround the city. I decided I'd do an English paper about the Beats\r\nfirst. City Lights books had a great library in an upstairs room where\r\nAlan Ginsberg and his buddies had created their radical druggy poetry.\r\nThe one we'd read in English class was *Howl* and I would never forget\r\nthe opening lines, they gave me shivers down my back:\r\n\r\nI saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving\r\nhysterical naked,\r\n\r\ndragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an\r\nangry fix,\r\n\r\nangelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the\r\nstarry dynamo in the machinery of night...\r\n\r\nI liked the way he ran those words all together, \"starving hysterical\r\nnaked.\" I knew how that felt. And \"best minds of my generation\" made me\r\nthink hard too. It made me remember the park and the police and the gas\r\nfalling. They busted Ginsberg for obscenity over Howl -- all about a\r\nline about gay sex that would hardly have caused us to blink an eye\r\ntoday. It made me happy somehow, knowing that we'd made some progress.\r\nThat things had been even more restrictive than this before.\r\n\r\nI lost myself in the library, reading these beautiful old editions of\r\nthe books. I got lost in Jack Kerouac's *On the Road*, a novel I'd been\r\nmeaning to read for a long time, and a clerk who came up to check on me\r\nnodded approvingly and found me a cheap edition that he sold me for six\r\nbucks.\r\n\r\nI walked into Chinatown and had dim sum buns and noodles with hot-sauce\r\nthat I had previously considered to be pretty hot, but which would\r\nnever seem anything like hot ever again, not now that I'd had an Ange\r\nspecial.\r\n\r\nAs the day wore on toward the afternoon, I got on the BART and switched\r\nto a San Mateo bridge shuttle bus to bring me around to the East Bay. I\r\nread my copy of *On the Road* and dug the scenery whizzing past. *On\r\nthe Road* is a semi-autobiographical novel about Jack Kerouac, a\r\ndruggy, hard-drinking writer who goes hitchhiking around America,\r\nworking crummy jobs, howling through the streets at night, meeting\r\npeople and parting ways. Hipsters, sad-faced hobos, con-men, muggers,\r\nscumbags and angels. There's not really a plot -- Kerouac supposedly\r\nwrote it in three weeks on a long roll of paper, stoned out of his mind\r\n-- only a bunch of amazing things, one thing happening after another.\r\nHe makes friends with self-destructing people like Dean Moriarty, who\r\nget him involved in weird schemes that never really work out, but still\r\nit works out, if you know what I mean.\r\n\r\nThere was a rhythm to the words, it was luscious, I could hear it being\r\nread aloud in my head. It made me want to lie down in the bed of a\r\npickup truck and wake up in a dusty little town somewhere in the\r\ncentral valley on the way to LA, one of those places with a gas station\r\nand a diner, and just walk out into the fields and meet people and see\r\nstuff and do stuff.\r\n\r\nIt was a long bus ride and I must have dozed off a little -- staying up\r\nlate IMing with Ange was hard on my sleep-schedule, since Mom still\r\nexpected me down for breakfast. I woke up and changed buses and before\r\nlong, I was at Ange's school.\r\n\r\nShe came bounding out of the gates in her uniform -- I'd never seen her\r\nin it before, it was kind of cute in a weird way, and reminded me of\r\nVan in her uniform. She gave me a long hug and a hard kiss on the\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\n\"Hello you!\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Hiya!\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatcha reading?\"\r\n\r\nI'd been waiting for this. I'd marked the passage with a finger.\r\n\"Listen: 'They danced down the streets like dingledodies, and I\r\nshambled after as I've been doing all my life after people who interest\r\nme, because the only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are\r\nmad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at\r\nthe same time, the ones that never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but\r\nburn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like\r\nspiders across the stars and in the middle you see the blue centerlight\r\npop and everybody goes \"Awww!\"'\"\r\n\r\nShe took the book and read the passage again for herself. \"Wow,\r\ndingledodies! I love it! Is it all like this?\"\r\n\r\nI told her about the parts I'd read, walking slowly down the sidewalk\r\nback toward the bus-stop. Once we turned the corner, she put her arm\r\naround my waist and I slung mine around her shoulder. Walking down the\r\nstreet with a girl -- my girlfriend? Sure, why not? -- talking about\r\nthis cool book. It was heaven. Made me forget my troubles for a little\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\n\"Marcus?\"\r\n\r\nI turned around. It was Van. In my subconscious I'd expected this. I\r\nknew because my conscious mind wasn't remotely surprised. It wasn't a\r\nbig school, and they all got out at the same time. I hadn't spoken to\r\nVan in weeks, and those weeks felt like months. We used to talk every\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, Van,\" I said. I suppressed the urge to take my arm off of Ange's\r\nshoulders. Van seemed surprised, but not angry, more ashen, shaken. She\r\nlooked closely at the two of us.\r\n\r\n\"Angela?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey, Vanessa,\" Ange said.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I came out to get Ange,\" I said, trying to keep my tone neutral. I was\r\nsuddenly embarrassed to be seen with another girl.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" Van said. \"Well, it was nice to see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nice to see you too, Vanessa,\" Ange said, swinging me around, marching\r\nme back toward the bus-stop.\r\n\r\n\"You know her?\" Ange said.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, since forever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was she your girlfriend?\"\r\n\r\n\"What? No! No way! We were just friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"You *were* friends?\"\r\n\r\nI felt like Van was walking right behind us, listening in, though at\r\nthe pace we were walking, she would have to be jogging to keep up. I\r\nresisted the temptation to look over my shoulder for as long as\r\npossible, then I did. There were lots of girls from the school behind\r\nus, but no Van.\r\n\r\n\"She was with me and Jose-Luis and Darryl when we were arrested. We\r\nused to ARG together. The four of us, we were kind of best friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what happened?\"\r\n\r\nI dropped my voice. \"She didn't like the Xnet,\" I said. \"She thought we\r\nwould get into trouble. That I'd get other people into trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that's why you stopped being friends?\"\r\n\r\n\"We just drifted apart.\"\r\n\r\nWe walked a few steps. \"You weren't, you know, boyfriend/girlfriend\r\nfriends?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" I said. My face was hot. I felt like I sounded like I was lying,\r\neven though I was telling the truth.\r\n\r\nAnge jerked us to a halt and studied my face.\r\n\r\n\"Were you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No! Seriously! Just friends. Darryl and her -- well, not quite, but\r\nDarryl was so into her. There was no way --\"\r\n\r\n\"But if Darryl hadn't been into her, you would have, huh?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Ange, no. Please, just believe me and let it go. Vanessa was a\r\ngood friend and we're not anymore, and that upsets me, but I was never\r\ninto her that way, all right?\r\n\r\nShe slumped a little. \"OK, OK. I'm sorry. I don't really get along with\r\nher is all. We've never gotten along in all the years we've known each\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\nOh ho, I thought. This would be how it came to be that Jolu knew her\r\nfor so long and I never met her; she had some kind of thing with Van\r\nand he didn't want to bring her around.\r\n\r\nShe gave me a long hug and we kissed, and a bunch of girls passed us\r\ngoing *woooo* and we straightened up and headed for the bus-stop. Ahead\r\nof us walked Van, who must have gone past while we were kissing. I felt\r\nlike a complete jerk.\r\n\r\nOf course, she was at the stop and on the bus and we didn't say a word\r\nto each other, and I tried to make conversation with Ange all the way,\r\nbut it was awkward.\r\n\r\nThe plan was to stop for a coffee and head to Ange's place to hang out\r\nand \"study,\" i.e. take turns on her Xbox looking at the Xnet. Ange's\r\nmom got home late on Tuesdays, which was her night for yoga class and\r\ndinner with her girls, and Ange's sister was going out with her\r\nboyfriend, so we'd have the place to ourselves. I'd been having pervy\r\nthoughts about it ever since we'd made the plan.\r\n\r\nWe got to her place and went straight to her room and shut the door.\r\nHer room was kind of a disaster, covered with layers of clothes and\r\nnotebooks and parts of PCs that would dig into your stocking feet like\r\ncaltrops. Her desk was worse than the floor, piled high with books and\r\ncomics, so we ended up sitting on her bed, which was OK by me.\r\n\r\nThe awkwardness from seeing Van had gone away somewhat and we got her\r\nXbox up and running. It was in the center of a nest of wires, some\r\ngoing to a wireless antenna she'd hacked into it and stuck to the\r\nwindow so she could tune in the neighbors' WiFi. Some went to a couple\r\nof old laptop screens she'd turned into standalone monitors, balanced\r\non stands and bristling with exposed electronics. The screens were on\r\nboth bedside tables, which was an excellent setup for watching movies\r\nor IMing from bed -- she could turn the monitors sidewise and lie on\r\nher side and they'd be right-side-up, no matter which side she lay on.\r\n\r\nWe both knew what we were really there for, sitting side by side\r\npropped against the bedside table. I was trembling a little and\r\nsuper-conscious of the warmth of her leg and shoulder against mine, but\r\nI needed to go through the motions of logging into Xnet and seeing what\r\nemail I'd gotten and so on.\r\n\r\nThere was an email from a kid who liked to send in funny phone-cam\r\nvideos of the DHS being really crazy -- the last one had been of them\r\ndisassembling a baby's stroller after a bomb-sniffing dog had shown an\r\ninterest in it, taking it apart with screwdrivers right on the street\r\nin the Marina while all these rich people walked past, staring at them\r\nand marveling at how weird it was.\r\n\r\nI'd linked to the video and it had been downloaded like crazy. He'd\r\nhosted it on the Internet Archive's Alexandria mirror in Egypt, where\r\nthey'd host anything for free so long as you'd put it under the\r\nCreative Commons license, which let anyone remix it and share it. The\r\nUS archive -- which was down in the Presidio, only a few minutes away\r\n-- had been forced to take down all those videos in the name of\r\nnational security, but the Alexandria archive had split away into its\r\nown organization and was hosting anything that embarrassed the USA.\r\n\r\nThis kid -- his handle was Kameraspie -- had sent me an even better\r\nvideo this time around. It was at the doorway to City Hall in Civic\r\nCenter, a huge wedding cake of a building covered with statues in\r\nlittle archways and gilt leaves and trim. The DHS had a secure\r\nperimeter around the building, and Kameraspie's video showed a great\r\nshot of their checkpoint as a guy in an officer's uniform approached\r\nand showed his ID and put his briefcase on the X-ray belt.\r\n\r\nIt was all OK until one of the DHS people saw something he didn't like\r\non the X-ray. He questioned the General, who rolled his eyes and said\r\nsomething inaudible (the video had been shot from across the street,\r\napparently with a homemade concealed zoom lens, so the audio was mostly\r\nof people walking past and traffic noises).\r\n\r\nThe General and the DHS guys got into an argument, and the longer they\r\nargued, the more DHS guys gathered around them. Finally, the General\r\nshook his head angrily and waved his finger at the DHS guy's chest and\r\npicked up his briefcase and started to walk away. The DHS guys shouted\r\nat him, but he didn't slow. His body language really said, \"I am\r\ntotally, utterly pissed.\"\r\n\r\nThen it happened. The DHS guys ran after the general. Kameraspie slowed\r\nthe video down here, so we could see, in frame-by-frame slo-mo, the\r\ngeneral half-turning, his face all like, \"No freaking way are you about\r\nto tackle me,\" then changing to horror as three of the giant DHS guards\r\nslammed into him, knocking him sideways, then catching him at the\r\nmiddle, like a career-ending football tackle. The general -- middle\r\naged, steely grey hair, lined and dignified face -- went down like a\r\nsack of potatoes and bounced twice, his face slamming off the sidewalk\r\nand blood starting out of his nose.\r\n\r\nThe DHS hog-tied the general, strapping him at ankles and wrists. The\r\ngeneral was shouting now, really shouting, his face purpling under the\r\nblood streaming from his nose. Legs swished by in the tight zoom.\r\nPassing pedestrians looked at this guy in his uniform, getting tied up,\r\nand you could see from his face that this was the worst part, this was\r\nthe ritual humiliation, the removal of dignity. The clip ended.\r\n\r\n\"Oh my dear sweet Buddha,\" I said looking at the screen as it faded to\r\nblack, starting the video again. I nudged Ange and showed her the clip.\r\nShe watched wordless, jaw hanging down to her chest.\r\n\r\n\"Post that,\" she said. \"Post that post that post that post that!\"\r\n\r\nI posted it. I could barely type as I wrote it up, describing what I'd\r\nseen, adding a note to see if anyone could identify the military man in\r\nthe video, if anyone knew anything about this.\r\n\r\nI hit publish.\r\n\r\nWe watched the video. We watched it again.\r\n\r\nMy email pinged.\r\n\r\n> I totally recognize that dude -- you can find his bio on Wikipedia.\r\n> He's General Claude Geist. He commanded the joint UN peacekeeping\r\n> mission in Haiti.\r\n\r\nI checked the bio. There was a picture of the general at a press\r\nconference, and notes about his role in the difficult Haiti mission. It\r\nwas clearly the same guy.\r\n\r\nI updated the post.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, this was Ange's and my chance to make out, but that\r\nwasn't what we ended up doing. We crawled the Xnet blogs, looking for\r\nmore accounts of the DHS searching people, tackling people, invading\r\nthem. This was a familiar task, the same thing I'd done with all the\r\nfootage and accounts from the riots in the park. I started a new\r\ncategory on my blog for this, AbusesOfAuthority, and filed them away.\r\nAnge kept coming up with new search terms for me to try and by the time\r\nher mom got home, my new category had seventy posts, headlined by\r\nGeneral Geist's City Hall takedown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI worked on my Beat paper all the next day at home, reading the Kerouac\r\nand surfing the Xnet. I was planning on meeting Ange at school, but I\r\ntotally wimped out at the thought of seeing Van again, so I texted her\r\nan excuse about working on the paper.\r\n\r\nThere were all kinds of great suggestions for AbusesOfAuthority coming\r\nin; hundreds of little and big ones, pictures and audio. The meme was\r\nspreading.\r\n\r\nIt spread. The next morning there were even more. Someone started a new\r\nblog called AbusesOfAuthority that collected hundreds more. The pile\r\ngrew. We competed to find the juiciest stories, the craziest pictures.\r\n\r\nThe deal with my parents was that I'd eat breakfast with them every\r\nmorning and talk about the projects I was doing. They liked that I was\r\nreading Kerouac. It had been a favorite book of both of theirs and it\r\nturned out there was already a copy on the bookcase in my parents'\r\nroom. My dad brought it down and I flipped through it. There were\r\npassages marked up with pen, dog-eared pages, notes in the margin. My\r\ndad had really loved this book.\r\n\r\nIt made me remember a better time, when my Dad and I had been able to\r\ntalk for five minutes without shouting at each other about terrorism,\r\nand we had a great breakfast talking about the way that the novel was\r\nplotted, all the crazy adventures.\r\n\r\nBut the next morning at breakfast they were both glued to the radio.\r\n\r\n\"Abuses of Authority -- it's the latest craze on San Francisco's\r\nnotorious Xnet, and it's captured the world's attention. Called A-oh-A,\r\nthe movement is composed of 'Little Brothers' who watch back against\r\nthe Department of Homeland Security's anti-terrorism measures,\r\ndocumenting the failures and excesses. The rallying cry is a popular\r\nviral video clip of a General Claude Geist, a retired three-star\r\ngeneral, being tackled by DHS officers on the sidewalk in front of City\r\nHall. Geist hasn't made a statement on the incident, but commentary\r\nfrom young people who are upset with their own treatment has been fast\r\nand furious.\r\n\r\n\"Most notable has been the global attention the movement has received.\r\nStills from the Geist video have appeared on the front pages of\r\nnewspapers in Korea, Great Britain, Germany, Egypt and Japan, and\r\nbroadcasters around the world have aired the clip on prime-time news.\r\nThe issue came to a head last night, when the British Broadcasting\r\nCorporation's National News Evening program ran a special report on the\r\nfact that no American broadcaster or news agency has covered this\r\nstory. Commenters on the BBC's website noted that BBC America's version\r\nof the news did not carry the report.\"\r\n\r\nThey brought on a couple of interviews: British media watchdogs, a\r\nSwedish Pirate Party kid who made jeering remarks about America's\r\ncorrupt press, a retired American newscaster living in Tokyo, then they\r\naired a short clip from Al-Jazeera, comparing the American press record\r\nand the record of the national news-media in Syria.\r\n\r\nI felt like my parents were staring at me, that they knew what I was\r\ndoing. But when I cleared away my dishes, I saw that they were looking\r\nat each other.\r\n\r\nDad was holding his coffee cup so hard his hands were shaking. Mom was\r\nlooking at him.\r\n\r\n\"They're trying to discredit us,\" Dad said finally. \"They're trying to\r\nsabotage the efforts to keep us safe.\"\r\n\r\nI opened my mouth, but my mom caught my eye and shook her head. Instead\r\nI went up to my room and worked on my Kerouac paper. Once I'd heard the\r\ndoor slam twice, I fired up my Xbox and got online.\r\n\r\n> Hello M1k3y. This is Colin Brown. I'm a producer with the Canadian\r\n> Broadcasting Corporation's news programme The National. We're doing a\r\n> story on Xnet and have sent a reporter to San Francisco to cover it\r\n> from there. Would you be interested in doing an interview to discuss\r\n> your group and its actions?\r\n\r\nI stared at the screen. Jesus. They wanted to *interview* me about \"my\r\ngroup\"?\r\n\r\n> Um thanks no. I'm all about privacy. And it's not \"my group.\" But\r\n> thanks for doing the story!\r\n\r\nA minute later, another email.\r\n\r\n> We can mask you and ensure your anonymity. You know that the\r\n> Department of Homeland Security will be happy to provide their own\r\n> spokesperson. I'm interested in getting your side.\r\n\r\nI filed the email. He was right, but I'd be crazy to do this. For all I\r\nknew, he *was* the DHS.\r\n\r\nI picked up more Kerouac. Another email came in. Same request,\r\ndifferent news-agency: KQED wanted to meet me and record a radio\r\ninterview. A station in Brazil. The Australian Broadcasting\r\nCorporation. Deutsche Welle. All day, the press requests came in. All\r\nday, I politely turned them down.\r\n\r\nI didn't get much Kerouac read that day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Hold a press-conference,\" is what Ange said, as we sat in the cafe\r\nnear her place that evening. I wasn't keen on going out to her school\r\nanymore, getting stuck on a bus with Van again.\r\n\r\n\"What? Are you crazy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do it in Clockwork Plunder. Just pick a trading post where there's no\r\nPvP allowed and name a time. You can login from here.\"\r\n\r\nPvP is player-versus-player combat. Parts of Clockwork Plunder were\r\nneutral ground, which meant that we could theoretically bring in a ton\r\nof noob reporters without worrying about gamers killing them in the\r\nmiddle of the press-conference.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know anything about press conferences.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, just google it. I'm sure someone's written an article on holding a\r\nsuccessful one. I mean, if the President can manage it, I'm sure you\r\ncan. He looks like he can barely tie his shoes without help.\"\r\n\r\nWe ordered more coffee.\r\n\r\n\"You are a very smart woman,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"And I'm beautiful,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"That too,\" I said.\r\n\r\n &&&\r\n\r\nChapter 15\r\n\r\n[[This chapter is dedicated to Chapters/Indigo, the national Canadian\r\nmegachain. I was working at Bakka, the independent science fiction\r\nbookstore, when Chapters opened its first store in Toronto and I knew\r\nthat something big was going on right away, because two of our\r\nsmartest, best-informed customers stopped in to tell me that they'd\r\nbeen hired to run the science fiction section. From the start, Chapters\r\nraised the bar on what a big corporate bookstore could be, extending\r\nits hours, adding a friendly cafe and lots of seating, installing\r\nin-store self-service terminals and stocking the most amazing variety\r\nof titles.]]\r\n\r\n[[Chapters/Indigo:\r\nhttp://www.chapters.indigo.ca/books/Little-Brother-Cory-Doctorow/\r\n9780765319852-item.html]]\r\n\r\nI blogged the press-conference even before I'd sent out the invitations\r\nto the press. I could tell that all these writers wanted to make me\r\ninto a leader or a general or a supreme guerrilla commandant, and I\r\nfigured one way of solving that would be to have a bunch of Xnetters\r\nrunning around answering questions too.\r\n\r\nThen I emailed the press. The responses ranged from puzzled to\r\nenthusiastic -- only the Fox reporter was \"outraged\" that I had the\r\ngall to ask her to play a game in order to appear on her TV show. The\r\nrest of them seemed to think that it would make a pretty cool story,\r\nthough plenty of them wanted lots of tech support for signing onto the\r\ngame\r\n\r\nI picked 8PM, after dinner. Mom had been bugging me about all the\r\nevenings I'd been spending out of the house until I finally spilled the\r\nbeans about Ange, whereupon she came over all misty and kept looking at\r\nme like, my-little-boy's-growing-up. She wanted to meet Ange, and I\r\nused that as leverage, promising to bring her over the next night if I\r\ncould \"go to the movies\" with Ange tonight.\r\n\r\nAnge's mom and sister were out again -- they weren't real stay-at-homes\r\n-- which left me and Ange alone in her room with her Xbox and mine. I\r\nunplugged one of her bedside screens and attached my Xbox to it so that\r\nwe could both login at once.\r\n\r\nBoth Xboxes were idle, logged into Clockwork Plunder. I was pacing.\r\n\r\n\"It's going to be fine,\" she said. She glanced at her screen. \"Patcheye\r\nPete's Market has 600 players in it now!\" We'd picked Patcheye Pete's\r\nbecause it was the market closest to the village square where new\r\nplayers spawned. If the reporters weren't already Clockwork Plunder\r\nplayers -- ha! -- then that's where they'd show up. In my blog post I'd\r\nasked people generally to hang out on the route between Patcheye Pete's\r\nand the spawn-gate and direct anyone who looked like a disoriented\r\nreporter over to Pete's.\r\n\r\n\"What the hell am I going to tell them?\"\r\n\r\n\"You just answer their questions -- and if you don't like a question,\r\nignore it. Someone else can answer it. It'll be fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is insane.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is perfect, Marcus. If you want to really screw the DHS, you have\r\nto embarrass them. It's not like you're going to be able to out-shoot\r\nthem. Your only weapon is your ability to make them look like morons.\"\r\n\r\nI flopped on the bed and she pulled my head into her lap and stroked my\r\nhair. I'd been playing around with different haircuts before the\r\nbombing, dying it all kinds of funny colors, but since I'd gotten out\r\nof jail I couldn't be bothered. It had gotten long and stupid and\r\nshaggy and I'd gone into the bathroom and grabbed my clippers and\r\nbuzzed it down to half an inch all around, which took zero effort to\r\ntake care of and helped me to be invisible when I was out jamming and\r\ncloning arphids.\r\n\r\nI opened my eyes and stared into her big brown eyes behind her glasses.\r\nThey were round and liquid and expressive. She could make them bug out\r\nwhen she wanted to make me laugh, or make them soft and sad, or lazy\r\nand sleepy in a way that made me melt into a puddle of horniness.\r\n\r\nThat's what she was doing right now.\r\n\r\nI sat up slowly and hugged her. She hugged me back. We kissed. She was\r\nan amazing kisser. I know I've already said that, but it bears\r\nrepeating. We kissed a lot, but for one reason or another we always\r\nstopped before it got too heavy.\r\n\r\nNow I wanted to go farther. I found the hem of her t-shirt and tugged.\r\nShe put her hands over her head and pulled back a few inches. I knew\r\nthat she'd do that. I'd known since the night in the park. Maybe that's\r\nwhy we hadn't gone farther -- I knew I couldn't rely on her to back\r\noff, which scared me a little.\r\n\r\nBut I wasn't scared then. The impending press-conference, the fights\r\nwith my parents, the international attention, the sense that there was\r\na movement that was careening around the city like a wild pinball -- it\r\nmade my skin tingle and my blood sing.\r\n\r\nAnd she was beautiful, and smart, and clever and funny, and I was\r\nfalling in love with her.\r\n\r\nHer shirt slid off, her arching her back to help me get it over her\r\nshoulders. She reached behind her and did something and her bra fell\r\naway. I stared goggle-eyed, motionless and breathless, and then she\r\ngrabbed *my* shirt and pulled it over my head, grabbing me and pulling\r\nmy bare chest to hers.\r\n\r\nWe rolled on the bed and touched each other and ground our bodies\r\ntogether and groaned. She kissed all over my chest and I did the same\r\nto her. I couldn't breathe, I couldn't think, I could only move and\r\nkiss and lick and touch.\r\n\r\nWe dared each other to go forward. I undid her jeans. She undid mine. I\r\nlowered her zipper, she did mine, and tugged my jeans off. I tugged off\r\nhers. A moment later we were both naked, except for my socks, which I\r\npeeled off with my toes.\r\n\r\nIt was then that I caught sight of the bedside clock, which had long\r\nago rolled onto the floor and lay there, glowing up at us.\r\n\r\n\"Crap!\" I yelped. \"It starts in two minutes!\" I couldn't freaking\r\nbelieve that I was about to stop what I was about to stop doing, when I\r\nwas about to stop doing it. I mean, if you'd asked me, \"Marcus, you are\r\nabout to get laid for the firstest time EVAR, will you stop if I let\r\noff this nuclear bomb in the same room as you?\" the answer would have\r\nbeen a resounding and unequivocal *NO*.\r\n\r\nAnd yet we stopped for this.\r\n\r\nShe grabbed me and pulled my face to hers and kissed me until I thought\r\nI would pass out, then we both grabbed our clothes and more or less\r\ndressed, grabbing our keyboards and mice and heading for Patcheye\r\nPete's.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou could easily tell who the press were: they were the noobs who\r\nplayed their characters like staggering drunks, weaving back and forth\r\nand up and down, trying to get the hang of it all, occasionally hitting\r\nthe wrong key and offering strangers all or part of their inventory, or\r\ngiving them accidental hugs and kicks.\r\n\r\nThe Xnetters were easy to spot, too: we all played Clockwork Plunder\r\nwhenever we had some spare time (or didn't feel like doing our\r\nhomework), and we had pretty tricked-out characters with cool weapons\r\nand booby-traps on the keys sticking out of our backs that would cream\r\nanyone who tried to snatch them and leave us to wind down.\r\n\r\nWhen I appeared, a system status message displayed M1K3Y HAS ENTERED\r\nPATCHEYE PETE'S -- WELCOME SWABBIE WE OFFER FAIR TRADE FOR FINE BOOTY.\r\nAll the players on the screen froze, then they crowded around me. The\r\nchat exploded. I thought about turning on my voice-paging and grabbing\r\na headset, but seeing how many people were trying to talk at once, I\r\nrealized how confusing that would be. Text was much easier to follow\r\nand they couldn't misquote me (heh heh).\r\n\r\nI'd scouted the location before with Ange -- it was great campaigning\r\nwith her, since we could both keep each other wound up. There was a\r\nhigh-spot on a pile of boxes of salt-rations that I could stand on and\r\nbe seen from anywhere in the market.\r\n\r\n> Good evening and thank you all for coming. My name is M1k3y and I'm\r\n> not the leader of anything. All around you are Xnetters who have as\r\n> much to say about why we're here as I do. I use the Xnet because I\r\n> believe in freedom and the Constitution of the United States of\r\n> America. I use Xnet because the DHS has turned my city into a\r\n> police-state where we're all suspected terrorists. I use Xnet because\r\n> I think you can't defend freedom by tearing up the Bill of Rights. I\r\n> learned about the Constitution in a California school and I was\r\n> raised to love my country for its freedom. If I have a philosophy, it\r\n> is this:\r\n\r\n> Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from\r\n> the consent of the governed, that whenever any form of government\r\n> becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to\r\n> alter or abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its\r\n> foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such\r\n> form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and\r\n> happiness.\r\n\r\n> I didn't write that, but I believe it. The DHS does not govern with\r\n> my consent.\r\n\r\n> Thank you\r\n\r\nI'd written this the day before, bouncing drafts back and forth with\r\nAnge. Pasting it in only took a second, though it took everyone in the\r\ngame a moment to read it. A lot of the Xnetters cheered, big showy\r\npirate \"Hurrah\"s with raised sabers and pet parrots squawking and\r\nflying overhead.\r\n\r\nGradually, the journalists digested it too. The chat was running past\r\nfast, so fast you could barely read it, lots of Xnetters saying things\r\nlike \"Right on\" and \"America, love it or leave it\" and \"DHS go home\"\r\nand \"America out of San Francisco,\" all slogans that had been big on\r\nthe Xnet blogosphere.\r\n\r\n> M1k3y, this is Priya Rajneesh from the BBC. You say you're not the\r\n> leader of any movement, but do you believe there is a movement? Is it\r\n> called the Xnet?\r\n\r\nLots of answers. Some people said there wasn't a movement, some said\r\nthere was and lots of people had ideas about what it was called: Xnet,\r\nLittle Brothers, Little Sisters, and my personal favorite, the United\r\nStates of America.\r\n\r\nThey were really cooking. I let them go, thinking of what I could say.\r\nOnce I had it, I typed,\r\n\r\n> I think that kind of answers your question, doesn't it? There may be\r\n> one or more movements and they may be called Xnet or not.\r\n\r\n> M1k3y, I'm Doug Christensen from the Washington Internet Daily. What\r\n> do you think the DHS should be doing to prevent another attack on San\r\n> Francisco, if what they're doing isn't successful.\r\n\r\nMore chatter. Lots of people said that the terrorists and the\r\ngovernment were the same -- either literally, or just meaning that they\r\nwere equally bad. Some said the government knew how to catch terrorists\r\nbut preferred not to because \"war presidents\" got re-elected.\r\n\r\n> I don't know\r\n\r\nI typed finally.\r\n\r\n> I really don't. I ask myself this question a lot because I don't want\r\n> to get blown up and I don't want my city to get blown up. Here's what\r\n> I've figured out, though: if it's the DHS's job to keep us safe,\r\n> they're failing. All the crap they've done, none of it would stop the\r\n> bridge from being blown up again. Tracing us around the city? Taking\r\n> away our freedom? Making us suspicious of each other, turning us\r\n> against each other? Calling dissenters traitors? The point of\r\n> terrorism is to terrify us. The DHS terrifies me. \r\n\r\n> I don't have any say in what the terrorists do to me, but if this is\r\n> a free country then I should be able to at least say what my own cops\r\n> do to me. I should be able to keep them from terrorizing me. \r\n\r\n> I know that's not a good answer. Sorry.\r\n\r\n> What do you mean when you say that the DHS wouldn't stop terrorists?\r\n> How do you know? \r\n\r\n> Who are you?\r\n\r\n> I'm with the Sydney Morning Herald.\r\n\r\n> I'm 17 years old. I'm not a straight-A student or anything. Even so,\r\n> I figured out how to make an Internet that they can't wiretap. I\r\n> figured out how to jam their person-tracking technology. I can turn\r\n> innocent people into suspects and turn guilty people into innocents\r\n> in their eyes. I could get metal onto an airplane or beat a no-fly\r\n> list. I figured this stuff out by looking at the web and by thinking\r\n> about it. If I can do it, terrorists can do it. They told us they\r\n> took away our freedom to make us safe. Do you feel safe?\r\n\r\n> In Australia? Why yes I do\r\n\r\nThe pirates all laughed.\r\n\r\nMore journalists asked questions. Some were sympathetic, some were\r\nhostile. When I got tired, I handed my keyboard to Ange and let her be\r\nM1k3y for a while. It didn't really feel like M1k3y and me were the\r\nsame person anymore anyway. M1k3y was the kind of kid who talked to\r\ninternational journalists and inspired a movement. Marcus got suspended\r\nfrom school and fought with his dad and wondered if he was good enough\r\nfor his kick-ass girlfriend.\r\n\r\nBy 11PM I'd had enough. Besides, my parents would be expecting me home\r\nsoon. I logged out of the game and so did Ange and we lay there for a\r\nmoment. I took her hand and she squeezed hard. We hugged.\r\n\r\nShe kissed my neck and murmured something.\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"I said I love you,\" she said. \"What, you want me to send you a\r\ntelegram?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wow,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"You're that surprised, huh?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Um. It's just -- I was going to say that to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure you were,\" she said, and bit the tip of my nose.\r\n\r\n\"It's just that I've never said it before,\" I said. \"So I was working\r\nup to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You still haven't said it, you know. Don't think I haven't noticed. We\r\ngirls pick upon these things.\"\r\n\r\n\"I love you, Ange Carvelli,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"I love you too, Marcus Yallow.\"\r\n\r\nWe kissed and nuzzled and I started to breathe hard and so did she.\r\nThat's when her mom knocked on the door.\r\n\r\n\"Angela,\" she said, \"I think it's time your friend went home, don't\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, mother,\" she said, and mimed swinging an axe. As I put my socks\r\nand shoes on, she muttered, \"They'll say, that Angela, she was such a\r\ngood girl, who would have thought it, all the time she was in the back\r\nyard, helping her mother out by sharpening that hatchet.\"\r\n\r\nI laughed. \"You don't know how easy you have it. There is *no way* my\r\nfolks would leave us alone in my bedroom until 11 o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"11:45,\" she said, checking her clock.\r\n\r\n\"Crap!\" I yelped and tied my shoes.\r\n\r\n\"Go,\" she said, \"run and be free! Look both ways before crossing the\r\nroad! Write if you get work! Don't even stop for a hug! If you're not\r\nout of here by the count of ten, there's going to be *trouble*, mister.\r\nOne. Two. Three.\"\r\n\r\nI shut her up by leaping onto the bed, landing on her and kissing her\r\nuntil she stopped trying to count. Satisfied with my victory, I pounded\r\ndown the stairs, my Xbox under my arm.\r\n\r\nHer mom was at the foot of the stairs. We'd only met a couple times.\r\nShe looked like an older, taller version of Ange -- Ange said her\r\nfather was the short one -- with contacts instead of glasses. She\r\nseemed to have tentatively classed me as a good guy, and I appreciated\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"Good night, Mrs Carvelli,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Good night, Mr Yallow,\" she said. It was one of our little rituals,\r\never since I'd called her Mrs Carvelli when we first met.\r\n\r\nI found myself standing awkwardly by the door.\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Um,\" I said. \"Thanks for having me over.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're always welcome in our home, young man,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"And thanks for Ange,\" I said finally, hating how lame it sounded. But\r\nshe smiled broadly and gave me a brief hug.\r\n\r\n\"You're very welcome,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThe whole bus ride home, I thought over the press-conference, thought\r\nabout Ange naked and writhing with me on her bed, thought about her\r\nmother smiling and showing me the door.\r\n\r\nMy mom was waiting up for me. She asked me about the movie and I gave\r\nher the response I'd worked out in advance, cribbing from the review it\r\nhad gotten in the *Bay Guardian*.\r\n\r\nAs I fell asleep, the press-conference came back. I was really proud of\r\nit. It had been so cool, to have all these big-shot journos show up in\r\nthe game, to have them listen to me and to have them listen to all the\r\npeople who believed in the same things as me. I dropped off with a\r\nsmile on my lips.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI should have known better.\r\n\r\nXNET LEADER: I COULD GET METAL ONTO AN AIRPLANE\r\n\r\nDHS DOESN'T HAVE MY CONSENT TO GOVERN\r\n\r\nXNET KIDS: USA OUT OF SAN FRANCISCO\r\n\r\nThose were the *good* headlines. Everyone sent me the articles to blog,\r\nbut it was the last thing I wanted to do.\r\n\r\nI'd blown it, somehow. The press had come to my press-conference and\r\nconcluded that we were terrorists or terrorist dupes. The worst was the\r\nreporter on Fox News, who had apparently shown up anyway, and who\r\ndevoted a ten-minute commentary to us, talking about our \"criminal\r\ntreason.\" Her killer line, repeated on every news-outlet I found, was:\r\n\r\n\"They say they don't have a name. I've got one for them. Let's call\r\nthese spoiled children Cal-Quaeda. They do the terrorists' work on the\r\nhome front. When -- not if, but when -- California gets attacked again,\r\nthese brats will be as much to blame as the House of Saud.\"\r\n\r\nLeaders of the anti-war movement denounced us as fringe elements. One\r\nguy went on TV to say that he believed we had been fabricated by the\r\nDHS to discredit them.\r\n\r\nThe DHS had their own press-conference announcing that they would\r\ndouble the security in San Francisco. They held up an arphid cloner\r\nthey'd found somewhere and demonstrated it in action, using it to stage\r\na car-theft, and warned everyone to be on their alert for young people\r\nbehaving suspiciously, especially those whose hands were out of sight.\r\n\r\nThey weren't kidding. I finished my Kerouac paper and started in on a\r\npaper about the Summer of Love, the summer of 1967 when the anti-war\r\nmovement and the hippies converged on San Francisco. The guys who\r\nfounded Ben and Jerry's -- old hippies themselves -- had founded a\r\nhippie museum in the Haight, and there were other archives and exhibits\r\nto see around town.\r\n\r\nBut it wasn't easy getting around. By the end of the week, I was\r\ngetting frisked an average of four times a day. Cops checked my ID and\r\nquestioned me about why I was out in the street, carefully eyeballing\r\nthe letter from Chavez saying that I was suspended.\r\n\r\nI got lucky. No one arrested me. But the rest of the Xnet weren't so\r\nlucky. Every night the DHS announced more arrests, \"ringleaders\" and\r\n\"operatives\" of Xnet, people I didn't know and had never heard of,\r\nparaded on TV along with the arphid sniffers and other devices that had\r\nbeen in their pockets. They announced that the people were \"naming\r\nnames,\" compromising the \"Xnet network\" and that more arrests were\r\nexpected soon. The name \"M1k3y\" was often heard.\r\n\r\nDad loved this. He and I watched the news together, him gloating, me\r\nshrinking away, quietly freaking out. \"You should see the stuff they're\r\ngoing to use on these kids,\" Dad said. \"I've seen it in action. They'll\r\nget a couple of these kids and check out their friends lists on IM and\r\nthe speed-dials on their phones, look for names that come up over and\r\nover, look for patterns, bringing in more kids. They're going to\r\nunravel them like an old sweater.\"\r\n\r\nI canceled Ange's dinner at our place and started spending even more\r\ntime there. Ange's little sister Tina started to call me \"the\r\nhouse-guest,\" as in \"is the house-guest eating dinner with me tonight?\"\r\nI liked Tina. All she cared about was going out and partying and\r\nmeeting guys, but she was funny and utterly devoted to Ange. One night\r\nas we were doing the dishes, she dried her hands and said,\r\nconversationally, \"You know, you seem like a nice guy, Marcus. My\r\nsister's just crazy about you and I like you too. But I have to tell\r\nyou something: if you break her heart, I will track you down and pull\r\nyour scrotum over your head. It's not a pretty sight.\"\r\n\r\nI assured her that I would sooner pull my own scrotum over my head than\r\nbreak Ange's heart and she nodded. \"So long as we're clear on that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your sister is a nut,\" I said as we lay on Ange's bed again, looking\r\nat Xnet blogs. That is pretty much all we did: fool around and read\r\nXnet.\r\n\r\n\"Did she use the scrotum line on you? I hate it when she does that. She\r\njust loves the word 'scrotum,' you know. It's nothing personal.\"\r\n\r\nI kissed her. We read some more.\r\n\r\n\"Listen to this,\" she said. \"Police project four to six *hundred*\r\narrests this weekend in what they say will be the largest coordinated\r\nraid on Xnet dissidents to date.\"\r\n\r\nI felt like throwing up.\r\n\r\n\"We've got to stop this,\" I said. \"You know there are people who are\r\ndoing *more* jamming to show that they're not intimidated? Isn't that\r\njust *crazy?*\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it's brave,\" she said. \"We can't let them scare us into\r\nsubmission.\"\r\n\r\n\"What? No, Ange, no. We can't let hundreds of people go to *jail*. You\r\nhaven't been there. I have. It's worse than you think. It's worse than\r\nyou can imagine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a pretty fertile imagination,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Stop it, OK? Be serious for a second. I won't do this. I won't send\r\nthose people to jail. If I do, I'm the guy that Van thinks I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Marcus, I'm being serious. You think that these people don't know they\r\ncould go to jail? They believe in the cause. You believe in it too.\r\nGive them the credit to know what they're getting into. It's not up to\r\nyou to decide what risks they can or can't take.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's my responsibility because if I tell them to stop, they'll stop.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you weren't the leader?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not, of course I'm not. But I can't help it if they look to me for\r\nguidance. And so long as they do, I have a responsibility to help them\r\nstay safe. You see that, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"All I see is you getting ready to cut and run at the first sign of\r\ntrouble. I think you're afraid they're going to figure out who *you*\r\nare. I think you're afraid for *you*.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's not fair,\" I said, sitting up, pulling away from her.\r\n\r\n\"Really? Who's the guy who nearly had a heart attack when he thought\r\nthat his secret identity was out?\"\r\n\r\n\"That was different,\" I said. \"This isn't about me. You know it isn't.\r\nWhy are you being like this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why are *you* like this?\" she said. \"Why aren't *you* willing to be\r\nthe guy who was brave enough to get all this started?\"\r\n\r\n\"This isn't brave, it's suicide.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cheap teenage melodrama, M1k3y.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't call me that!\"\r\n\r\n\"What, 'M1k3y'? Why not, *M1k3y*?\"\r\n\r\nI put my shoes on. I picked up my bag. I walked home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Why I'm not jamming\r\n\r\n> I won't tell anyone else what to do, because I'm not anyone's leader,\r\n> no matter what Fox News thinks. \r\n\r\n> But I am going to tell you what *I* plan on doing. If you think\r\n> that's the right thing to do, maybe you'll do it too.\r\n\r\n> I'm not jamming. Not this week. Maybe not next. It's not because I'm\r\n> scared. It's because I'm smart enough to know that I'm better free\r\n> than in prison. They figured out how to stop our tactic, so we need\r\n> to come up with a new tactic. I don't care what the tactic is, but I\r\n> want it to work. It's *stupid* to get arrested. It's only jamming if\r\n> you get away with it.\r\n\r\n> There's another reason not to jam. If you get caught, they might use\r\n> you to catch your friends, and their friends, and their friends. They\r\n> might bust your friends even if they're not on Xnet, because the DHS\r\n> is like a maddened bull and they don't exactly worry if they've got\r\n> the right guy.\r\n\r\n> I'm not telling you what to do. \r\n\r\n> But the DHS is dumb and we're smart. Jamming proves that they can't\r\n> fight terrorism because it proves that they can't even stop a bunch\r\n> of kids. If you get caught, it makes them look like they're smarter\r\n> than us.\r\n\r\n> THEY AREN'T SMARTER THAN US! We are smarter than them. Let's be\r\n> smart. Let's figure out how to jam them, no matter how many goons\r\n> they put on the streets of our city.\r\n\r\nI posted it. I went to bed.\r\n\r\nI missed Ange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnge and I didn't speak for the next four days, including the weekend,\r\nand then it was time to go back to school. I'd almost called her a\r\nmillion times, written a thousand unsent emails and IMs.\r\n\r\nNow I was back in Social Studies class, and Mrs Andersen greeted me\r\nwith voluble, sarcastic courtesy, asking me sweetly how my \"holiday\"\r\nhad been. I sat down and mumbled nothing. I could hear Charles snicker.\r\n\r\nShe taught us a class on Manifest Destiny, the idea that the Americans\r\nwere destined to take over the whole world (or at least that's how she\r\nmade it seem) and seemed to be trying to provoke me into saying\r\nsomething so she could throw me out.\r\n\r\nI felt the eyes of the class on me, and it reminded me of M1k3y and the\r\npeople who looked up to him. I was sick of being looked up to. I missed\r\nAnge.\r\n\r\nI got through the rest of the day without anything making any kind of\r\nmark on me. I don't think I said eight words.\r\n\r\nFinally it was over and I hit the doors, heading for the gates and the\r\nstupid Mission and my pointless house.\r\n\r\nI was barely out the gate when someone crashed into me. He was a young\r\nhomeless guy, maybe my age, maybe a little older. He wore a long,\r\ngreasy overcoat, a pair of baggy jeans, and rotting sneakers that\r\nlooked like they'd been through a wood-chipper. His long hair hung over\r\nhis face, and he had a pubic beard that straggled down his throat into\r\nthe collar of a no-color knit sweater.\r\n\r\nI took this all in as we lay next to each other on the sidewalk, people\r\npassing us and giving us weird looks. It seemed that he'd crashed into\r\nme while hurrying down Valencia, bent over with the burden of a split\r\nbackpack that lay beside him on the pavement, covered in tight\r\ngeometric doodles in magic-marker.\r\n\r\nHe got to his knees and rocked back and forth, like he was drunk or had\r\nhit his head.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry buddy,\" he said. \"Didn't see you. You hurt?\"\r\n\r\nI sat up too. Nothing felt hurt.\r\n\r\n\"Um. No, it's OK.\"\r\n\r\nHe stood up and smiled. His teeth were shockingly white and straight,\r\nlike an ad for an orthodontic clinic. He held his hand out to me and\r\nhis grip was strong and firm.\r\n\r\n\"I'm really sorry.\" His voice was also clear and intelligent. I'd\r\nexpected him to sound like the drunks who talked to themselves as they\r\nroamed the Mission late at night, but he sounded like a knowledgeable\r\nbookstore clerk.\r\n\r\n\"It's no problem,\" I said.\r\n\r\nHe stuck out his hand again.\r\n\r\n\"Zeb,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Marcus,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"A pleasure, Marcus,\" he said. \"Hope to run into you again sometime!\"\r\n\r\nLaughing, he picked up his backpack, turned on his heel and hurried\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI walked the rest of the way home in a bemused fug. Mom was at the\r\nkitchen table and we had a little chat about nothing at all, the way we\r\nused to do, before everything changed.\r\n\r\nI took the stairs up to my room and flopped down in my chair. For once,\r\nI didn't want to login to the Xnet. I'd checked in that morning before\r\nschool to discover that my note had created a gigantic controversy\r\namong people who agreed with me and people who were righteously pissed\r\nthat I was telling them to back off from their beloved sport.\r\n\r\nI had three thousand projects I'd been in the middle of when it had all\r\nstarted. I was building a pinhole camera out of legos, I'd been playing\r\nwith aerial kite photography using an old digital camera with a trigger\r\nhacked out of silly putty that was stretched out at launch and slowly\r\nsnapped back to its original shape, triggering the shutter at regular\r\nintervals. I had a vacuum tube amp I'd been building into an ancient,\r\nrusted, dented olive-oil tin that looked like an archaeological find --\r\nonce it was done, I'd planned to build in a dock for my phone and a set\r\nof 5.1 surround-sound speakers out of tuna-fish cans.\r\n\r\nI looked over my workbench and finally picked up the pinhole camera.\r\nMethodically snapping legos together was just about my speed.\r\n\r\nI took off my watch and the chunky silver two-finger ring that showed a\r\nmonkey and a ninja squaring off to fight and dropped them into the\r\nlittle box I used for all the crap I load into my pockets and around my\r\nneck before stepping out for the day: phone, wallet, keys, wifinder,\r\nchange, batteries, retractable cables... I dumped it all out into the\r\nbox, and found myself holding something I didn't remember putting in\r\nthere in the first place.\r\n\r\nIt was a piece of paper, grey and soft as flannel, furry at the edges\r\nwhere it had been torn away from some larger piece of paper. It was\r\ncovered in the tiniest, most careful handwriting I'd ever seen. I\r\nunfolded it and held it up. The writing covered both sides, running\r\ndown from the top left corner of one side to a crabbed signature at the\r\nbottom right corner of the other side.\r\n\r\nThe signature read, simply: ZEB.\r\n\r\nI picked it up and started to read.\r\n\r\n> Dear Marcus\r\n\r\n> You don't know me but I know you. For the past three months, since\r\n> the Bay Bridge was blown up, I have been imprisoned on Treasure\r\n> Island. I was in the yard on the day you talked to that Asian girl\r\n> and got tackled. You were brave. Good on you.\r\n\r\n> I had a burst appendix the day afterward and ended up in the\r\n> infirmary. In the next bed was a guy named Darryl. We were both in\r\n> recovery for a long time and by the time we got well, we were too\r\n> much of an embarrassment to them to let go.\r\n\r\n> So they decided we must really be guilty. They questioned us every\r\n> day. You've been through their questioning, I know. Imagine it for\r\n> months. Darryl and I ended up cell-mates. We knew we were bugged, so\r\n> we only talked about inconsequentialities. But at night, when we were\r\n> in our cots, we would softly tap out messages to each other in Morse\r\n> code (I knew my HAM radio days would come in useful sometime). \r\n\r\n> At first, their questions to us were just the same crap as ever, who\r\n> did it, how'd they do it. But after a little while, they switched to\r\n> asking us about the Xnet. Of course, we'd never heard of it. That\r\n> didn't stop them asking.\r\n\r\n> Darryl told me that they brought him arphid cloners, Xboxes, all\r\n> kinds of technology and demanded that he tell them who used them,\r\n> where they learned to mod them. Darryl told me about your games and\r\n> the things you learned.\r\n\r\n> Especially: The DHS asked us about our friends. Who did we know? What\r\n> were they like? Did they have political feelings? Had they been in\r\n> trouble at school? With the law? \r\n\r\n> We call the prison Gitmo-by-the-Bay. It's been a week since I got out\r\n> and I don't think that anyone knows that their sons and daughters are\r\n> imprisoned in the middle of the Bay. At night we could hear people\r\n> laughing and partying on the mainland.\r\n\r\n> I got out last week. I won't tell you how, in case this falls into\r\n> the wrong hands. Maybe others will take my route. \r\n\r\n> Darryl told me how to find you and made me promise to tell you what I\r\n> knew when I got back. Now that I've done that I'm out of here like\r\n> last year. One way or another, I'm leaving this country. Screw\r\n> America.\r\n\r\n> Stay strong. They're scared of you. Kick them for me. Don't get\r\n> caught.\r\n\r\n> Zeb\r\n\r\nThere were tears in my eyes as I finished the note. I had a disposable\r\nlighter somewhere on my desk that I sometimes used to melt the\r\ninsulation off of wires, and I dug it out and held it to the note. I\r\nknew I owed it to Zeb to destroy it and make sure no one else ever saw\r\nit, in case it might lead them back to him, wherever he was going.\r\n\r\nI held the flame and the note, but I couldn't do it.\r\n\r\nDarryl.\r\n\r\nWith all the crap with the Xnet and Ange and the DHS, I'd almost\r\nforgotten he existed. He'd become a ghost, like an old friend who'd\r\nmoved away or gone on an exchange program. All that time, they'd been\r\nquestioning him, demanding that he rat me out, explain the Xnet, the\r\njammers. He'd been on Treasure Island, the abandoned military base that\r\nwas halfway along the demolished span of the Bay Bridge. He'd been so\r\nclose I could have swam to him.\r\n\r\nI put the lighter down and re-read the note. By the time it was done, I\r\nwas weeping, sobbing. It all came back to me, the lady with the severe\r\nhaircut and the questions she'd asked and the reek of piss and the\r\nstiffness of my pants as the urine dried them into coarse canvas.\r\n\r\n\"Marcus?\"\r\n\r\nMy door was ajar and my mother was standing in it, watching me with a\r\nworried look. How long had she been there?\r\n\r\nI armed the tears away from my face and snorted up the snot. \"Mom,\" I\r\nsaid. \"Hi.\"\r\n\r\nShe came into my room and hugged me. \"What is it? Do you need to talk?\"\r\n\r\nThe note lay on the table.\r\n\r\n\"Is that from your girlfriend? Is everything all right?\"\r\n\r\nShe'd given me an out. I could just blame it all on problems with Ange\r\nand she'd leave my room and leave me alone. I opened my mouth to do\r\njust that, and then this came out:\r\n\r\n\"I was in jail. After the bridge blew. I was in jail for that whole\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nThe sobs that came then didn't sound like my voice. They sounded like\r\nan animal noise, maybe a donkey or some kind of big cat noise in the\r\nnight. I sobbed so my throat burned and ached with it, so my chest\r\nheaved.\r\n\r\nMom took me in her arms, the way she used to when I was a little boy,\r\nand she stroked my hair, and she murmured in my ear, and rocked me, and\r\ngradually, slowly, the sobs dissipated.\r\n\r\nI took a deep breath and Mom got me a glass of water. I sat on the edge\r\nof my bed and she sat in my desk chair and I told her everything.\r\n\r\nEverything.\r\n\r\nWell, most of it.\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nChapter 16\r\n\r\n[[This chapter is dedicated to San Francisco's Booksmith, ensconced in\r\nthe storied Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, just a few doors down from the\r\nBen and Jerry's at the exact corner of Haight and Ashbury. The\r\nBooksmith folks really know how to run an author event -- when I lived\r\nin San Francisco, I used to go down all the time to hear incredible\r\nwriters speak (William Gibson was unforgettable). They also produce\r\nlittle baseball-card-style trading cards for each author -- I have two\r\nfrom my own appearances there.]]\r\n\r\n[[Booksmith http://thebooksmith.booksense.com 1644 Haight St. San\r\nFrancisco CA 94117 USA +1 415 863 8688]]\r\n\r\nAt first Mom looked shocked, then outraged, and finally she gave up\r\naltogether and just let her jaw hang open as I took her through the\r\ninterrogation, pissing myself, the bag over my head, Darryl. I showed\r\nher the note.\r\n\r\n\"Why --?\"\r\n\r\nIn that single syllable, every recrimination I'd dealt myself in the\r\nnight, every moment that I'd lacked the bravery to tell the world what\r\nit was really about, why I was really fighting, what had really\r\ninspired the Xnet.\r\n\r\nI sucked in a breath.\r\n\r\n\"They told me I'd go to jail if I talked about it. Not just for a few\r\ndays. Forever. I was -- I was scared.\"\r\n\r\nMom sat with me for a long time, not saying anything. Then, \"What about\r\nDarryl's father?\"\r\n\r\nShe might as well have stuck a knitting needle in my chest. Darryl's\r\nfather. He must have assumed that Darryl was dead, long dead.\r\n\r\nAnd wasn't he? After the DHS has held you illegally for three months,\r\nwould they ever let you go?\r\n\r\nBut Zeb got out. Maybe Darryl would get out. Maybe me and the Xnet\r\ncould help get Darryl out.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't told him,\" I said.\r\n\r\nNow Mom was crying. She didn't cry easily. It was a British thing. It\r\nmade her little hiccoughing sobs much worse to hear.\r\n\r\n\"You will tell him,\" she managed. \"You will.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will.\"\r\n\r\n\"But first we have to tell your father.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDad no longer had any regular time when he came home. Between his\r\nconsulting clients -- who had lots of work now that the DHS was\r\nshopping for data-mining startups on the peninsula -- and the long\r\ncommute to Berkeley, he might get home any time between 6PM and\r\nmidnight.\r\n\r\nTonight Mom called him and told him he was coming home *right now*. He\r\nsaid something and she just repeated it: *right now*.\r\n\r\nWhen he got there, we had arranged ourselves in the living room with\r\nthe note between us on the coffee table.\r\n\r\nIt was easier to tell, the second time. The secret was getting lighter.\r\nI didn't embellish, I didn't hide anything. I came clean.\r\n\r\nI'd heard of coming clean before but I'd never understood what it meant\r\nuntil I did it. Holding in the secret had dirtied me, soiled my spirit.\r\nIt had made me afraid and ashamed. It had made me into all the things\r\nthat Ange said I was.\r\n\r\nDad sat stiff as a ramrod the whole time, his face carved of stone.\r\nWhen I handed him the note, he read it twice and then set it down\r\ncarefully.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head and stood up and headed for the front door.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going?\" Mom asked, alarmed.\r\n\r\n\"I need a walk,\" was all he managed to gasp, his voice breaking.\r\n\r\nWe stared awkwardly at each other, Mom and me, and waited for him to\r\ncome home. I tried to imagine what was going on in his head. He'd been\r\nsuch a different man after the bombings and I knew from Mom that what\r\nhad changed him were the days of thinking I was dead. He'd come to\r\nbelieve that the terrorists had nearly killed his son and it had made\r\nhim crazy.\r\n\r\nCrazy enough to do whatever the DHS asked, to line up like a good\r\nlittle sheep and let them control him, drive him.\r\n\r\nNow he knew that it was the DHS that had imprisoned me, the DHS that\r\nhad taken San Francisco's children hostage in Gitmo-by-the-Bay. It made\r\nperfect sense, now that I thought of it. Of course it had been Treasure\r\nIsland where I'd been kept. Where else was a ten-minute boat-ride from\r\nSan Francisco?\r\n\r\nWhen Dad came back, he looked angrier than he ever had in his life.\r\n\r\n\"You should have told me!\" he roared.\r\n\r\nMom interposed herself between him and me. \"You're blaming the wrong\r\nperson,\" she said. \"It wasn't Marcus who did the kidnapping and the\r\nintimidation.\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head and stamped. \"I'm not blaming Marcus. I know\r\n*exactly* who's to blame. Me. Me and the stupid DHS. Get your shoes on,\r\ngrab your coats.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are we going?\"\r\n\r\n\"To see Darryl's father. Then we're going to Barbara Stratford's\r\nplace.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI knew the name Barbara Stratford from somewhere, but I couldn't\r\nremember where. I thought that maybe she was an old friend of my\r\nparents, but I couldn't exactly place her.\r\n\r\nMeantime, I was headed for Darryl's father's place. I'd never really\r\nfelt comfortable around the old man, who'd been a Navy radio operator\r\nand ran his household like a tight ship. He'd taught Darryl Morse code\r\nwhen he was a kid, which I'd always thought was cool. It was one of the\r\nways I knew that I could trust Zeb's letter. But for every cool thing\r\nlike Morse code, Darryl's father had some crazy military discipline\r\nthat seemed to be for its own sake, like insisting on hospital corners\r\non the beds and shaving twice a day. It drove Darryl up the wall.\r\n\r\nDarryl's mother hadn't liked it much either, and had taken off back to\r\nher family in Minnesota when Darryl was ten -- Darryl spent his summers\r\nand Christmases there.\r\n\r\nI was sitting in the back of the car, and I could see the back of Dad's\r\nhead as he drove. The muscles in his neck were tense and kept jumping\r\naround as he ground his jaws.\r\n\r\nMom kept her hand on his arm, but no one was around to comfort me. If\r\nonly I could call Ange. Or Jolu. Or Van. Maybe I would when the day was\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\"He must have buried his son in his mind,\" Dad said, as we whipped up\r\nthrough the hairpin curves leading up Twin Peaks to the little cottage\r\nthat Darryl and his father shared. The fog was on Twin Peaks, the way\r\nit often was at night in San Francisco, making the headlamps reflect\r\nback on us. Each time we swung around a corner, I saw the valleys of\r\nthe city laid out below us, bowls of twinkling lights that shifted in\r\nthe mist.\r\n\r\n\"Is this the one?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"This is it.\" I hadn't been to Darryl's in months, but\r\nI'd spent enough time here over the years to recognize it right off.\r\n\r\nThe three of us stood around the car for a long moment, waiting to see\r\nwho would go and ring the doorbell. To my surprise, it was me.\r\n\r\nI rang it and we all waited in held-breath silence for a minute. I rang\r\nit again. Darryl's father's car was in the driveway, and we'd seen a\r\nlight burning in the living room. I was about to ring a third time when\r\nthe door opened.\r\n\r\n\"Marcus?\" Darryl's father wasn't anything like I remembered him.\r\nUnshaven, in a housecoat and bare feet, with long toenails and red\r\neyes. He'd gained weight, and a soft extra chin wobbled beneath the\r\nfirm military jaw. His thin hair was wispy and disordered.\r\n\r\n\"Mr Glover,\" I said. My parents crowded into the door behind me.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Ron,\" my mother said.\r\n\r\n\"Ron,\" my father said.\r\n\r\n\"You too? What's going on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can we come in?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHis living room looked like one of those news-segments they show about\r\nabandoned kids who spend a month locked in before they're rescued by\r\nthe neighbors: frozen meal boxes, empty beer cans and juice bottles,\r\nmoldy cereal bowls and piles of newspapers. There was a reek of cat\r\npiss and litter crunched underneath our feet. Even without the cat\r\npiss, the smell was incredible, like a bus-station toilet.\r\n\r\nThe couch was made up with a grimy sheet and a couple of greasy pillows\r\nand the cushions had a dented, much-slept-upon look.\r\n\r\nWe all stood there for a long silent moment, embarrassment overwhelming\r\nevery other emotion. Darryl's father looked like he wanted to die.\r\n\r\nSlowly, he moved aside the sheets from the sofa and cleared the\r\nstacked, greasy food-trays off of a couple of the chairs, carrying them\r\ninto the kitchen, and, from the sound of it, tossing them on the floor.\r\n\r\nWe sat gingerly in the places he'd cleared, and then he came back and\r\nsat down too.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said vaguely. \"I don't really have any coffee to offer\r\nyou. I'm having more groceries delivered tomorrow so I'm running low\r\n--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ron,\" my father said. \"Listen to us. We have something to tell you,\r\nand it's not going to be easy to hear.\"\r\n\r\nHe sat like a statue as I talked. He glanced down at the note, read it\r\nwithout seeming to understand it, then read it again. He handed it back\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nHe was trembling.\r\n\r\n\"He's --\"\r\n\r\n\"Darryl is alive,\" I said. \"Darryl is alive and being held prisoner on\r\nTreasure Island.\"\r\n\r\nHe stuffed his fist in his mouth and made a horrible groaning sound.\r\n\r\n\"We have a friend,\" my father said. \"She writes for the *Bay Guardian*.\r\nAn investigative reporter.\"\r\n\r\nThat's where I knew the name from. The free weekly *Guardian* often\r\nlost its reporters to bigger daily papers and the Internet, but Barbara\r\nStratford had been there forever. I had a dim memory of having dinner\r\nwith her when I was a kid.\r\n\r\n\"We're going there now,\" my mother said. \"Will you come with us, Ron?\r\nWill you tell her Darryl's story?\"\r\n\r\nHe put his face in his hands and breathed deeply. Dad tried to put his\r\nhand on his shoulders, but Mr Glover shook it off violently.\r\n\r\n\"I need to clean myself up,\" he said. \"Give me a minute.\"\r\n\r\nMr Glover came back downstairs a changed man. He'd shaved and gelled\r\nhis hair back, and had put on a crisp military dress uniform with a row\r\nof campaign ribbons on the breast. He stopped at the foot of the stairs\r\nand kind of gestured at it.\r\n\r\n\"I don't have much clean stuff that's presentable at the moment. And\r\nthis seemed appropriate. You know, if she wanted to take pictures.\"\r\n\r\nHe and Dad rode up front and I got in the back, behind him. Up close,\r\nhe smelled a little of beer, like it was coming through his pores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was midnight by the time we rolled into Barbara Stratford's\r\ndriveway. She lived out of town, down in Mountain View, and as we sped\r\ndown the 101, none of us said a word. The high-tech buildings alongside\r\nthe highway streamed past us.\r\n\r\nThis was a different Bay Area to the one I lived in, more like the\r\nsuburban America I sometimes saw on TV. Lots of freeways and\r\nsubdivisions of identical houses, towns where there weren't any\r\nhomeless people pushing shopping carts down the sidewalk -- there\r\nweren't even sidewalks!\r\n\r\nMom had phoned Barbara Stratford while we were waiting for Mr Glover to\r\ncome downstairs. The journalist had been sleeping, but Mom had been so\r\nwound up she forgot to be all British and embarrassed about waking her\r\nup. Instead, she just told her, tensely, that she had something to talk\r\nabout and that it had to be in person.\r\n\r\nWhen we rolled up to Barbara Stratford's house, my first thought was of\r\nthe Brady Bunch place -- a low ranch house with a brick baffle in front\r\nof it and a neat, perfectly square lawn. There was a kind of abstract\r\ntile pattern on the baffle, and an old-fashioned UHF TV antenna rising\r\nfrom behind it. We wandered around to the entrance and saw that there\r\nwere lights on inside already.\r\n\r\nThe writer opened the door before we had a chance to ring the bell. She\r\nwas about my parents' age, a tall thin woman with a hawk-like nose and\r\nshrewd eyes with a lot of laugh-lines. She was wearing a pair of jeans\r\nthat were hip enough to be seen at one of the boutiques on Valencia\r\nStreet, and a loose Indian cotton blouse that hung down to her thighs.\r\nShe had small round glasses that flashed in her hallway light.\r\n\r\nShe smiled a tight little smile at us.\r\n\r\n\"You brought the whole clan, I see,\" she said.\r\n\r\nMom nodded. \"You'll understand why in a minute,\" she said. Mr Glover\r\nstepped from behind Dad.\r\n\r\n\"And you called in the Navy?\"\r\n\r\n\"All in good time.\"\r\n\r\nWe were introduced one at a time to her. She had a firm handshake and\r\nlong fingers.\r\n\r\nHer place was furnished in Japanese minimalist style, just a few\r\nprecisely proportioned, low pieces of furniture, large clay pots of\r\nbamboo that brushed the ceiling, and what looked like a large, rusted\r\npiece of a diesel engine perched on top of a polished marble plinth. I\r\ndecided I liked it. The floors were old wood, sanded and stained, but\r\nnot filled, so you could see cracks and pits underneath the varnish. I\r\n*really* liked that, especially as I walked over it in my stocking\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\"I have coffee on,\" she said. \"Who wants some?\"\r\n\r\nWe all put up our hands. I glared defiantly at my parents.\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" she said.\r\n\r\nShe disappeared into another room and came back a moment later bearing\r\na rough bamboo tray with a half-gallon thermos jug and six cups of\r\nprecise design but with rough, sloppy decorations. I liked those too.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" she said, once she'd poured and served. \"It's very good to see\r\nyou all again. Marcus, I think the last time I saw you, you were maybe\r\nseven years old. As I recall, you were very excited about your new\r\nvideo games, which you showed me.\"\r\n\r\nI didn't remember it at all, but that sounded like what I'd been into\r\nat seven. I guessed it was my Sega Dreamcast.\r\n\r\nShe produced a tape-recorder and a yellow pad and a pen, and twirled\r\nthe pen. \"I'm here to listen to whatever you tell me, and I can promise\r\nyou that I'll take it all in confidence. But I can't promise that I'll\r\ndo anything with it, or that it's going to get published.\" The way she\r\nsaid it made me realize that my Mom had called in a pretty big favor\r\ngetting this lady out of bed, friend or no friend. It must be kind of a\r\npain in the ass to be a big-shot investigative reporter. There were\r\nprobably a million people who would have liked her to take up their\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nMom nodded at me. Even though I'd told the story three times that\r\nnight, I found myself tongue-tied. This was different from telling my\r\nparents. Different from telling Darryl's father. This -- this would\r\nstart a new move in the game.\r\n\r\nI started slowly, and watched Barbara take notes. I drank a whole cup\r\nof coffee just explaining what ARGing was and how I got out of school\r\nto play. Mom and Dad and Mr Glover all listened intently to this part.\r\nI poured myself another cup and drank it on the way to explaining how\r\nwe were taken in. By the time I'd run through the whole story, I'd\r\ndrained the pot and I needed a piss like a race-horse.\r\n\r\nHer bathroom was just as stark as the living-room, with a brown,\r\norganic soap that smelled like clean mud. I came back in and found the\r\nadults quietly watching me.\r\n\r\nMr Glover told his story next. He didn't have anything to say about\r\nwhat had happened, but he explained that he was a veteran and that his\r\nson was a good kid. He talked about what it felt like to believe that\r\nhis son had died, about how his ex-wife had had a collapse when she\r\nfound out and ended up in a hospital. He cried a little, unashamed, the\r\ntears streaming down his lined face and darkening the collar of his\r\ndress-uniform.\r\n\r\nWhen it was all done, Barbara went into a different room and came back\r\nwith a bottle of Irish whiskey. \"It's a Bushmills 15 year old rum-cask\r\naged blend,\" she said, setting down four small cups. None for me. \"It\r\nhasn't been sold in ten years. I think this is probably an appropriate\r\ntime to break it out.\"\r\n\r\nShe poured them each a small glass of the liquor, then raised hers and\r\nsipped at it, draining half the glass. The rest of the adults followed\r\nsuit. They drank again, and finished the glasses. She poured them new\r\nshots.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" she said. \"Here's what I can tell you right now. I believe\r\nyou. Not just because I know you, Lillian. The story sounds right, and\r\nit ties in with other rumors I've heard. But I'm not going to be able\r\nto just take your word for it. I'm going to have to investigate every\r\naspect of this, and every element of your lives and stories. I need to\r\nknow if there's anything you're not telling me, anything that could be\r\nused to discredit you after this comes to light. I need everything. It\r\ncould take weeks before I'm ready to publish.\r\n\r\n\"You also need to think about your safety and this Darryl's safety. If\r\nhe's really an 'un-person' then bringing pressure to bear on the DHS\r\ncould cause them to move him somewhere much further away. Think Syria.\r\nThey could also do something much worse.\" She let that hang in the air.\r\nI knew she meant that they might kill him.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to take this letter and scan it now. I want pictures of the\r\ntwo of you, now and later -- we can send out a photographer, but I want\r\nto document this as thoroughly as I can tonight, too.\"\r\n\r\nI went with her into her office to do the scan. I'd expected a stylish,\r\nlow-powered computer that fit in with her decor, but instead, her\r\nspare-bedroom/office was crammed with top-of-the-line PCs, big\r\nflat-panel monitors, and a scanner big enough to lay a whole sheet of\r\nnewsprint on. She was fast with it all, too. I noted with some approval\r\nthat she was running ParanoidLinux. This lady took her job seriously.\r\n\r\nThe computers' fans set up an effective white-noise shield, but even\r\nso, I closed the door and moved in close to her.\r\n\r\n\"Um, Barbara?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"About what you said, about what might be used to discredit me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"What I tell you, you can't be forced to tell anyone else, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"In theory. Let me put it this way. I've gone to jail twice rather than\r\nrat out a source.\"\r\n\r\n\"OK, OK. Good. Wow. Jail. Wow. OK.\" I took a deep breath. \"You've heard\r\nof Xnet? Of M1k3y?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm M1k3y.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" she said. She worked the scanner and flipped the note over to get\r\nthe reverse. She was scanning at some unbelievable resolution, 10,000\r\ndots per inch or higher, and on-screen it was like the output of an\r\nelectron-tunneling microscope.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that does put a different complexion on this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" I said. \"I guess it does.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your parents don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nope. And I don't know if I want them to.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's something you're going to have to work out. I need to think\r\nabout this. Can you come by my office? I'd like to talk to you about\r\nwhat this means, exactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you have an Xbox Universal? I could bring over an installer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'm sure that can be arranged. When you come by, tell the\r\nreceptionist that you're Mr Brown, to see me. They know what that\r\nmeans. No note will be taken of you coming, and all the security camera\r\nfootage for the day will be automatically scrubbed and the cameras\r\ndeactivated until you leave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wow,\" I said. \"You think like I do.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled and socked me in the shoulder. \"Kiddo, I've been at this\r\ngame for a hell of a long time. So far, I've managed to spend more time\r\nfree than behind bars. Paranoia is my friend.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI was like a zombie the next day in school. I'd totaled about three\r\nhours of sleep, and even three cups of the Turk's caffeine mud failed\r\nto jump-start my brain. The problem with caffeine is that it's too easy\r\nto get acclimated to it, so you have to take higher and higher doses\r\njust to get above normal.\r\n\r\nI'd spent the night thinking over what I had to do. It was like running\r\nthough a maze of twisty little passages, all alike, every one leading\r\nto the same dead end. When I went to Barbara, it would be over for me.\r\nThat was the outcome, no matter how I thought about it.\r\n\r\nBy the time the school day was over, all I wanted was to go home and\r\ncrawl into bed. But I had an appointment at the *Bay Guardian*, down on\r\nthe waterfront. I kept my eyes on my feet as I wobbled out the gate,\r\nand as I turned into 24th Street, another pair of feet fell into step\r\nwith me. I recognized the shoes and stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Ange?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked like I felt. Sleep-deprived and raccoon-eyed, with sad\r\nbrackets in the corners of her mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Hi there,\" she said. \"Surprise. I gave myself French Leave from\r\nschool. I couldn't concentrate anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Um,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Shut up and give me a hug, you idiot.\"\r\n\r\nI did. It felt good. Better than good. It felt like I'd amputated part\r\nof myself and it had been reattached.\r\n\r\n\"I love you, Marcus Yallow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I love you, Angela Carvelli.\"\r\n\r\n\"OK,\" she said breaking it off. \"I liked your post about why you're not\r\njamming. I can respect it. What have you done about finding a way to\r\njam them without getting caught?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm on my way to meet an investigative journalist who's going to\r\npublish a story about how I got sent to jail, how I started Xnet, and\r\nhow Darryl is being illegally held by the DHS at a secret prison on\r\nTreasure Island.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh.\" She looked around for a moment. \"Couldn't you think of anything,\r\nyou know, ambitious?\"\r\n\r\n\"Want to come?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am coming, yes. And I would like you to explain this in detail if\r\nyou don't mind.\"\r\n\r\nAfter all the re-tellings, this one, told as we walked to Potrero\r\nAvenue and down to 15th Street, was the easiest. She held my hand and\r\nsqueezed it often.\r\n\r\nWe took the stairs up to the *Bay Guardian*'s offices two at a time. My\r\nheart was pounding. I got to the reception desk and told the bored girl\r\nbehind it, \"I'm here to see Barbara Stratford. My name is Mr Green.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you mean Mr Brown?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" I said, and blushed. \"Mr Brown.\"\r\n\r\nShe did something at her computer, then said, \"Have a seat. Barbara\r\nwill be out in a minute. Can I get you anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Coffee,\" we both said in unison. Another reason to love Ange: we were\r\naddicted to the same drug.\r\n\r\nThe receptionist -- a pretty latina woman only a few years older than\r\nus, dressed in Gap styles so old they were actually kind of\r\nhipster-retro -- nodded and stepped out and came back with a couple of\r\ncups bearing the newspaper's masthead.\r\n\r\nWe sipped in silence, watching visitors and reporters come and go.\r\nFinally, Barbara came to get us. She was wearing practically the same\r\nthing as the night before. It suited her. She quirked an eyebrow at me\r\nwhen she saw that I'd brought a date.\r\n\r\n\"Hello,\" I said. \"Um, this is --\"\r\n\r\n\"Ms Brown,\" Ange said, extending a hand. Oh, yeah, right, our\r\nidentities were supposed to be a secret. \"I work with Mr Green.\" She\r\nelbowed me lightly.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go then,\" Barbara said, and led us back to a board-room with\r\nlong glass walls with their blinds drawn shut. She set down a tray of\r\nWhole Foods organic Oreo clones, a digital recorder, and another yellow\r\npad.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to record this too?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nHadn't actually thought of that. I could see why it would be useful if\r\nI wanted to dispute what Barbara printed, though. Still, if I couldn't\r\ntrust her to do right by me, I was doomed anyway.\r\n\r\n\"No, that's OK,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Right, let's go. Young lady, my name is Barbara Stratford and I'm an\r\ninvestigative reporter. I gather you know why I'm here, and I'm curious\r\nto know why you're here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I work with Marcus on the Xnet,\" she said. \"Do you need to know my\r\nname?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not right now, I don't,\" Barbara said. \"You can be anonymous if you'd\r\nlike. Marcus, I asked you to tell me this story because I need to know\r\nhow it plays with the story you told me about your friend Darryl and\r\nthe note you showed me. I can see how it would be a good adjunct; I\r\ncould pitch this as the origin of the Xnet. 'They made an enemy they'll\r\nnever forget,' that sort of thing. But to be honest, I'd rather not\r\nhave to tell that story if I don't have to.\r\n\r\n\"I'd rather have a nice clean tale about the secret prison on our\r\ndoorstep, without having to argue about whether the prisoners there are\r\nthe sort of people likely to walk out the doors and establish an\r\nunderground movement bent on destabilizing the federal government. I'm\r\nsure you can understand that.\"\r\n\r\nI did. If the Xnet was part of the story, some people would say, see,\r\nthey need to put guys like that in jail or they'll start a riot.\r\n\r\n\"This is your show,\" I said. \"I think you need to tell the world about\r\nDarryl. When you do that, it's going to tell the DHS that I've gone\r\npublic and they're going to go after me. Maybe they'll figure out then\r\nthat I'm involved with the Xnet. Maybe they'll connect me to M1k3y. I\r\nguess what I'm saying is, once you publish about Darryl, it's all over\r\nfor me no matter what. I've made my peace with that.\"\r\n\r\n\"As good be hanged for a sheep as a lamb,\" she said. \"Right. Well,\r\nthat's settled. I want the two of you to tell me everything you can\r\nabout the founding and operation of the Xnet, and then I want a\r\ndemonstration. What do you use it for? Who else uses it? How did it\r\nspread? Who wrote the software? Everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"This'll take a while,\" Ange said.\r\n\r\n\"I've got a while,\" Barbara said. She drank some coffee and ate a fake\r\nOreo. \"This could be the most important story of the War on Terror.\r\nThis could be the story that topples the government. When you have a\r\nstory like this, you take it very carefully.\"\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nChapter 17\r\n\r\n[[This chapter is dedicated to Waterstone's, the national UK\r\nbookselling chain. Waterstone's is a chain of stores, but each one has\r\nthe feel of a great independent store, with tons of personality, great\r\nstock (especially audiobooks!), and knowledgeable staff.]]\r\n\r\n[[Waterstones http://www.waterstones.com]]\r\n\r\nSo we told her. I found it really fun, actually. Teaching people how to\r\nuse technology is always exciting. It's so cool to watch people figure\r\nout how the technology around them can be used to make their lives\r\nbetter. Ange was great too -- we made an excellent team. We'd trade off\r\nexplaining how it all worked. Barbara was pretty good at this stuff to\r\nbegin with, of course.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that she'd covered the crypto wars, the period in the\r\nearly nineties when civil liberties groups like the Electronic Frontier\r\nFoundation fought for the right of Americans to use strong crypto. I\r\ndimly knew about that period, but Barbara explained it in a way that\r\nmade me get goose-pimples.\r\n\r\nIt's unbelievable today, but there was a time when the government\r\nclassed crypto as a munition and made it illegal for anyone to export\r\nor use it on national security grounds. Get that? We used to have\r\nillegal *math* in this country.\r\n\r\nThe National Security Agency were the real movers behind the ban. They\r\nhad a crypto standard that they said was strong enough for bankers and\r\ntheir customers to use, but not so strong that the mafia would be able\r\nto keep its books secret from them. The standard, DES-56, was said to\r\nbe practically unbreakable. Then one of EFF's millionaire co-founders\r\nbuilt a $250,000 DES-56 cracker that could break the cipher in two\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nStill the NSA argued that it should be able to keep American citizens\r\nfrom possessing secrets it couldn't pry into. Then EFF dealt its\r\ndeath-blow. In 1995, they represented a Berkeley mathematics grad\r\nstudent called Dan Bernstein in court. Bernstein had written a crypto\r\ntutorial that contained computer code that could be used to make a\r\ncipher stronger than DES-56. Millions of times stronger. As far as the\r\nNSA was concerned, that made his article into a weapon, and therefore\r\nunpublishable.\r\n\r\nWell, it may be hard to get a judge to understand crypto and what it\r\nmeans, but it turned out that the average Appeals Court judge isn't\r\nreal enthusiastic about telling grad students what kind of articles\r\nthey're allowed to write. The crypto wars ended with a victory for the\r\ngood guys when the 9th Circuit Appellate Division Court ruled that code\r\nwas a form of expression protected under the First Amendment --\r\n\"Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.\" If you've\r\never bought something on the Internet, or sent a secret message, or\r\nchecked your bank-balance, you used crypto that EFF legalized. Good\r\nthing, too: the NSA just isn't that smart. Anything they know how to\r\ncrack, you can be sure that terrorists and mobsters can get around too.\r\n\r\nBarbara had been one of the reporters who'd made her reputation from\r\ncovering the issue. She'd cut her teeth covering the tail end of the\r\ncivil rights movement in San Francisco, and she recognized the\r\nsimilarity between the fight for the Constitution in the real world and\r\nthe fight in cyberspace.\r\n\r\nSo she got it. I don't think I could have explained this stuff to my\r\nparents, but with Barbara it was easy. She asked smart questions about\r\nour cryptographic protocols and security procedures, sometimes asking\r\nstuff I didn't know the answer to -- sometimes pointing out potential\r\nbreaks in our procedure.\r\n\r\nWe plugged in the Xbox and got it online. There were four open WiFi\r\nnodes visible from the board room and I told it to change between them\r\nat random intervals. She got this too -- once you were actually plugged\r\ninto the Xnet, it was just like being on the Internet, only some stuff\r\nwas a little slower, and it was all anonymous and unsniffable.\r\n\r\n\"So now what?\" I said as we wound down. I'd talked myself dry and I had\r\na terrible acid feeling from the coffee. Besides, Ange kept squeezing\r\nmy hand under the table in a way that made me want to break away and\r\nfind somewhere private to finish making up for our first fight.\r\n\r\n\"Now I do journalism. You go away and I research all the things you've\r\ntold me and try to confirm them to the extent that I can. I'll let you\r\nsee what I'm going to publish and I'll let you know when it's going to\r\ngo live. I'd prefer that you *not* talk about this with anyone else\r\nnow, because I want the scoop and because I want to make sure that I\r\nget the story before it goes all muddy from press speculation and DHS\r\nspin.\r\n\r\n\"I *will* have to call the DHS for comment before I go to press, but\r\nI'll do that in a way that protects you to whatever extent possible.\r\nI'll also be sure to let you know before that happens.\r\n\r\n\"One thing I need to be clear on: this isn't your story anymore. It's\r\nmine. You were very generous to give it to me and I'll try to repay the\r\ngift, but you don't get the right to edit anything out, to change it,\r\nor to stop me. This is now in motion and it won't stop. Do you\r\nunderstand that?\"\r\n\r\nI hadn't thought about it in those terms but once she said it, it was\r\nobvious. It meant that I had launched and I wouldn't be able to recall\r\nthe rocket. It was going to fall where it was aimed, or it would go off\r\ncourse, but it was in the air and couldn't be changed now. Sometime in\r\nthe near future, I would stop being Marcus -- I would be a public\r\nfigure. I'd be the guy who blew the whistle on the DHS.\r\n\r\nI'd be a dead man walking.\r\n\r\nI guess Ange was thinking along the same lines, because she'd gone a\r\ncolor between white and green.\r\n\r\n\"Let's get out of here,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnge's mom and sister were out again, which made it easy to decide\r\nwhere we were going for the evening. It was past supper time, but my\r\nparents had known that I was meeting with Barbara and wouldn't give me\r\nany grief if I came home late.\r\n\r\nWhen we got to Ange's, I had no urge to plug in my Xbox. I had had all\r\nthe Xnet I could handle for one day. All I could think about was Ange,\r\nAnge, Ange. Living without Ange. Knowing Ange was angry with me. Ange\r\nnever going to talk to me again. Ange never going to kiss me again.\r\n\r\nShe'd been thinking the same. I could see it in her eyes as we shut the\r\ndoor to her bedroom and looked at each other. I was hungry for her,\r\nlike you'd hunger for dinner after not eating for days. Like you'd\r\nthirst for a glass of water after playing soccer for three hours\r\nstraight.\r\n\r\nLike none of that. It was more. It was something I'd never felt before.\r\nI wanted to eat her whole, devour her.\r\n\r\nUp until now, she'd been the sexual one in our relationship. I'd let\r\nher set and control the pace. It was amazingly erotic to have *her*\r\ngrab *me* and take off my shirt, drag my face to hers.\r\n\r\nBut tonight I couldn't hold back. I wouldn't hold back.\r\n\r\nThe door clicked shut and I reached for the hem of her t-shirt and\r\nyanked, barely giving her time to lift her arms as I pulled it over her\r\nhead. I tore my own shirt over my head, listening to the cotton crackle\r\nas the stitches came loose.\r\n\r\nHer eyes were shining, her mouth open, her breathing fast and shallow.\r\nMine was too, my breath and my heart and my blood all roaring in my\r\nears.\r\n\r\nI took off the rest of our clothes with equal zest, throwing them into\r\nthe piles of dirty and clean laundry on the floor. There were books and\r\npapers all over the bed and I swept them aside. We landed on the unmade\r\nbedclothes a second later, arms around one another, squeezing like we\r\nwould pull ourselves right through one another. She moaned into my\r\nmouth and I made the sound back, and I felt her voice buzz in my vocal\r\nchords, a feeling more intimate than anything I'd ever felt before.\r\n\r\nShe broke away and reached for the bedstand. She yanked open the drawer\r\nand threw a white pharmacy bag on the bed before me. I looked inside.\r\nCondoms. Trojans. One dozen spermicidal. Still sealed. I smiled at her\r\nand she smiled back and I opened the box.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd thought about what it would be like for years. A hundred times a\r\nday I'd imagined it. Some days, I'd thought of practically nothing\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nIt was nothing like I expected. Parts of it were better. Parts of it\r\nwere lots worse. While it was going on, it felt like an eternity.\r\nAfterwards, it seemed to be over in the blink of an eye.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, I felt the same. But I also felt different. Something had\r\nchanged between us.\r\n\r\nIt was weird. We were both shy as we put our clothes on and puttered\r\naround the room, looking away, not meeting each other's eyes. I wrapped\r\nthe condom in a kleenex from a box beside the bed and took it into the\r\nbathroom and wound it with toilet paper and stuck it deep into the\r\ntrash-can.\r\n\r\nWhen I came back in, Ange was sitting up in bed and playing with her\r\nXbox. I sat down carefully beside her and took her hand. She turned to\r\nface me and smiled. We were both worn out, trembly.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" I said.\r\n\r\nShe didn't say anything. She turned her face to me. She was grinning\r\nhugely, but fat tears were rolling down her cheeks.\r\n\r\nI hugged her and she grabbed tightly onto me. \"You're a good man,\r\nMarcus Yallow,\" she whispered. \"Thank you.\"\r\n\r\nI didn't know what to say, but I squeezed her back. Finally, we parted.\r\nShe wasn't crying any more, but she was still smiling.\r\n\r\nShe pointed at my Xbox, on the floor beside the bed. I took the hint. I\r\npicked it up and plugged it in and logged in.\r\n\r\nSame old same old. Lots of email. The new posts on the blogs I read\r\nstreamed in. Spam. God did I get a lot of spam. My Swedish mailbox was\r\nrepeatedly \"joe-jobbed\" -- used as the return address for spams sent to\r\nhundreds of millions of Internet accounts, so that all the bounces and\r\nangry messages came back to me. I didn't know who was behind it. Maybe\r\nthe DHS trying to overwhelm my mailbox. Maybe it was just people\r\npranking. The Pirate Party had pretty good filters, though, and they\r\ngave anyone who wanted it 500 gigabytes of email storage, so I wasn't\r\nlikely to be drowned any time soon.\r\n\r\nI filtered it all out, hammering on the delete key. I had a separate\r\nmailbox for stuff that came in encrypted to my public key, since that\r\nwas likely to be Xnet-related and possibly sensitive. Spammers hadn't\r\nfigured out that using public keys would make their junk mail more\r\nplausible yet, so for now this worked well.\r\n\r\nThere were a couple dozen encrypted messages from people in the web of\r\ntrust. I skimmed them -- links to videos and pics of new abuses from\r\nthe DHS, horror stories about near-escapes, rants about stuff I'd\r\nblogged. The usual.\r\n\r\nThen I came to one that was only encrypted to my public key. That meant\r\nthat no one else could read it, but I had no idea who had written it.\r\nIt said it came from Masha, which could either be a handle or a name --\r\nI couldn't tell which.\r\n\r\n> M1k3y\r\n\r\n> You don't know me, but I know you. \r\n\r\n> I was arrested the day that the bridge blew.

It's not good advice, but at least it's easy to\r\nfollow. I leapt off the bed and paced back and forth. My heart thudded\r\nand my blood sang in a cruel parody of the way I'd felt when we got\r\nhome. This wasn't sexual excitement, it was raw terror.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" Ange said. \"What?\"\r\n\r\nI pointed at the screen on my side of the bed. She rolled over and\r\ngrabbed my keyboard and scribed on the touchpad with her fingertip. She\r\nread in silence.\r\n\r\nI paced.\r\n\r\n\"This has to be lies,\" she said. \"The DHS is playing games with your\r\nhead.\"\r\n\r\nI looked at her. She was biting her lip. She didn't look like she\r\nbelieved it.\r\n\r\n\"You think?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. They can't beat you, so they're coming after you using Xnet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah.\"\r\n\r\nI sat back down on the bed. I was breathing fast again.\r\n\r\n\"Chill out,\" she said. \"It's just head-games. Here.\"\r\n\r\nShe never took my keyboard from me before, but now there was a new\r\nintimacy between us. She hit reply and typed,\r\n\r\n> Nice try. \r\n\r\nShe was writing as M1k3y now, too. We were together in a way that was\r\ndifferent from before.\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead and sign it. We'll see what she says.\"\r\n\r\nI didn't know if that was the best idea, but I didn't have any better\r\nones. I signed it and encrypted it with my private key and the public\r\nkey Masha had provided.\r\n\r\nThe reply was instant.\r\n\r\n> I thought you'd say something like that.\r\n\r\n> Here's a hack you haven't thought of. I can anonymously tunnel video\r\n> over DNS. Here are some links to clips you might want to look at\r\n> before you decide I'm full of it. These people are all recording each\r\n> other, all the time, as insurance against a back-stab. It's pretty\r\n> easy to snoop off them as they snoop on each other.\r\n\r\n> Masha\r\n\r\nAttached was source-code for a little program that appeared to do\r\nexactly what Masha claimed: pull video over the Domain Name Service\r\nprotocol.\r\n\r\nLet me back up a moment here and explain something. At the end of the\r\nday, every Internet protocol is just a sequence of text sent back and\r\nforth in a prescribed order. It's kind of like getting a truck and\r\nputting a car in it, then putting a motorcycle in the car's trunk, then\r\nattaching a bicycle to the back of the motorcycle, then hanging a pair\r\nof Rollerblades on the back of the bike. Except that then, if you want,\r\nyou can attach the truck to the Rollerblades.\r\n\r\nFor example, take Simple Mail Transport Protocol, or SMTP, which is\r\nused for sending email.\r\n\r\nHere's a sample conversation between me and my mail server, sending a\r\nmessage to myself:\r\n\r\n> HELO littlebrother.com.se\r\n\r\n250 mail.pirateparty.org.se Hello mail.pirateparty.org.se, pleased to\r\nmeet you\r\n\r\n> MAIL FROM:m1k3y@littlebrother.com.se\r\n\r\n250 2.1.0 m1k3y@littlebrother.com.se... Sender ok\r\n\r\n> RCPT TO:m1k3y@littlebrother.com.se\r\n\r\n250 2.1.5 m1k3y@littlebrother.com.se... Recipient ok\r\n\r\n> DATA\r\n\r\n354 Enter mail, end with \".\" on a line by itself\r\n\r\n> When in trouble or in doubt, run in circles, scream and shout\r\n\r\n> .\r\n\r\n250 2.0.0 k5SMW0xQ006174 Message accepted for delivery\r\n\r\nQUIT\r\n\r\n221 2.0.0 mail.pirateparty.org.se closing connection\r\n\r\nConnection closed by foreign host.\r\n\r\nThis conversation's grammar was defined in 1982 by Jon Postel, one of\r\nthe Internet's heroic forefathers, who used to literally run the most\r\nimportant servers on the net under his desk at the University of\r\nSouthern California, back in the paleolithic era.\r\n\r\nNow, imagine that you hooked up a mail-server to an IM session. You\r\ncould send an IM to the server that said \"HELO littlebrother.com.se\"\r\nand it would reply with \"250 mail.pirateparty.org.se Hello\r\nmail.pirateparty.org.se, pleased to meet you.\" In other words, you\r\ncould have the same conversation over IM as you do over SMTP. With the\r\nright tweaks, the whole mail-server business could take place inside of\r\na chat. Or a web-session. Or anything else.\r\n\r\nThis is called \"tunneling.\" You put the SMTP inside a chat \"tunnel.\"\r\nYou could then put the chat back into an SMTP tunnel if you wanted to\r\nbe really weird, tunneling the tunnel in another tunnel.\r\n\r\nIn fact, every Internet protocol is susceptible to this process. It's\r\ncool, because it means that if you're on a network with only Web\r\naccess, you can tunnel your mail over it. You can tunnel your favorite\r\nP2P over it. You can even tunnel Xnet -- which itself is a tunnel for\r\ndozens of protocols -- over it.\r\n\r\nDomain Name Service is an interesting and ancient Internet protocol,\r\ndating back to 1983. It's the way that your computer converts a\r\ncomputer's name -- like pirateparty.org.se -- to the IP number that\r\ncomputers actually use to talk to each other over the net, like\r\n204.11.50.136. It generally works like magic, even though it's got\r\nmillions of moving parts -- every ISP runs a DNS server, as do most\r\ngovernments and lots of private operators. These DNS boxes all talk to\r\neach other all the time, making and filling requests to each other so\r\nno matter how obscure the name is you feed to your computer, it will be\r\nable to turn it into a number.\r\n\r\nBefore DNS, there was the HOSTS file. Believe it or not, this was a\r\nsingle document that listed the name and address of *every single\r\ncomputer* connected to the Internet. Every computer had a copy of it.\r\nThis file was eventually too big to move around, so DNS was invented,\r\nand ran on a server that used to live under Jon Postel's desk. If the\r\ncleaners knocked out the plug, the entire Internet lost its ability to\r\nfind itself. Seriously.\r\n\r\nThe thing about DNS today is that it's everywhere. Every network has a\r\nDNS server living on it, and all of those servers are configured to\r\ntalk to each other and to random people all over the Internet.\r\n\r\nWhat Masha had done was figure out a way to tunnel a video-streaming\r\nsystem over DNS. She was breaking up the video into billions of pieces\r\nand hiding each of them in a normal message to a DNS server. By running\r\nher code, I was able to pull the video from all those DNS servers, all\r\nover the Internet, at incredible speed. It must have looked bizarre on\r\nthe network histograms, like I was looking up the address of every\r\ncomputer in the world.\r\n\r\nBut it had two advantages I appreciated at once: I was able to get the\r\nvideo with blinding speed -- as soon as I clicked the first link, I\r\nstarted to receive full-screen pictures, without any jitter or\r\nstuttering -- and I had no idea where it was hosted. It was totally\r\nanonymous.\r\n\r\nAt first I didn't even clock the content of the video. I was totally\r\nfloored by the cleverness of this hack. Streaming video from DNS? That\r\nwas so smart and weird, it was practically *perverted*.\r\n\r\nGradually, what I was seeing began to sink in.\r\n\r\nIt was a board-room table in a small room with a mirror down one wall.\r\nI knew that room. I'd sat in that room, while Severe-Haircut woman had\r\nmade me speak my password aloud. There were five comfortable chairs\r\naround the table, each with a comfortable person, all in DHS uniform. I\r\nrecognized Major General Graeme Sutherland, the DHS Bay Area commander,\r\nalong with Severe Haircut. The others were new to me. They all watched\r\na video screen at the end of the table, on which there was an\r\ninfinitely more familiar face.\r\n\r\nKurt Rooney was known nationally as the President's chief strategist,\r\nthe man who returned the party for its third term, and who was steaming\r\ntowards a fourth. They called him \"Ruthless\" and I'd seen a news report\r\nonce about how tight a rein he kept his staffers on, calling them,\r\nIMing them, watching their every motion, controlling every step. He was\r\nold, with a lined face and pale gray eyes and a flat nose with broad,\r\nflared nostrils and thin lips, a man who looked like he was smelling\r\nsomething bad all the time.\r\n\r\nHe was the man on the screen. He was talking, and everyone else was\r\nfocused on his screen, everyone taking notes as fast as they could\r\ntype, trying to look smart.\r\n\r\n\"-- say that they're angry with authority, but we need to show the\r\ncountry that it's terrorists, not the government, that they need to\r\nblame. Do you understand me? The nation does not love that city. As far\r\nas they're concerned, it is a Sodom and Gomorrah of fags and atheists\r\nwho deserve to rot in hell. The only reason the country cares what they\r\nthink in San Francisco is that they had the good fortune to have been\r\nblown to hell by some Islamic terrorists.\r\n\r\n\"These Xnet children are getting to the point where they might start to\r\nbe useful to us. The more radical they get, the more the rest of the\r\nnation understands that there are threats everywhere.\"\r\n\r\nHis audience finished typing.\r\n\r\n\"We can control that, I think,\" Severe Haircut Lady said. \"Our people\r\nin the Xnet have built up a lot of influence. The Manchurian Bloggers\r\nare running as many as fifty blogs each, flooding the chat channels,\r\nlinking to each other, mostly just taking the party line set by this\r\nM1k3y. But they've already shown that they can provoke radical action,\r\neven when M1k3y is putting the brakes on.\"\r\n\r\nMajor General Sutherland nodded. \"We have been planning to leave them\r\nunderground until about a month before the midterms.\" I guessed that\r\nmeant the mid-term elections, not my exams. \"That's per the original\r\nplan. But it sounds like --\"\r\n\r\n\"We've got another plan for the midterms,\" Rooney said. \"Need-to-know,\r\nof course, but you should all probably not plan on traveling for the\r\nmonth before. Cut the Xnet loose now, as soon as you can. So long as\r\nthey're moderates, they're a liability. Keep them radical.\"\r\n\r\nThe video cut off.\r\n\r\nAnge and I sat on the edge of the bed, looking at the screen. Ange\r\nreached out and started the video again. We watched it. It was worse\r\nthe second time.\r\n\r\nI tossed the keyboard aside and got up.\r\n\r\n\"I am *so sick* of being scared,\" I said. \"Let's take this to Barbara\r\nand have her publish it all. Put it all on the net. Let them take me\r\naway. At least I'll know what's going to happen then. At least then\r\nI'll have a little *certainty* in my life.\"\r\n\r\nAnge grabbed me and hugged me, soothed me. \"I know baby, I know. It's\r\nall terrible. But you're focusing on the bad stuff and ignoring the\r\ngood stuff. You've created a movement. You've outflanked the jerks in\r\nthe White House, the crooks in DHS uniforms. You've put yourself in a\r\nposition where you could be responsible for blowing the lid off of the\r\nentire rotten DHS thing.\r\n\r\n\"Sure they're out to get you. Course they are. Have you ever doubted it\r\nfor a moment? I always figured they were. But Marcus, *they don't know\r\nwho you are*. Think about that. All those people, money, guns and\r\nspies, and you, a seventeen year old high school kid -- you're still\r\nbeating them. They don't know about Barbara. They don't know about Zeb.\r\nYou've jammed them in the streets of San Francisco and humiliated them\r\nbefore the world. So stop moping, all right? You're winning.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're coming for me, though. You see that. They're going to put me\r\nin jail forever. Not even jail. I'll just disappear, like Darryl. Maybe\r\nworse. Maybe Syria. Why leave me in San Francisco? I'm a liability as\r\nlong as I'm in the USA.\"\r\n\r\nShe sat down on the bed with me.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" she said. \"That.\"\r\n\r\n\"That.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you know what you have to do, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" She looked pointedly at my keyboard. I could see the tears\r\nrolling down her cheeks. \"No! You're out of your mind. You think I'm\r\ngoing to run off with some nut off the Internet? Some spy?\"\r\n\r\n\"You got a better idea?\"\r\n\r\nI kicked a pile of her laundry into the air. \"Whatever. Fine. I'll talk\r\nto her some more.\"\r\n\r\n\"You talk to her,\" Ange said. \"You tell her you and your girlfriend are\r\ngetting out.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up, dickhead. You think you're in danger? I'm in just as much\r\ndanger, Marcus. It's called guilt by association. When you go, I go.\"\r\nShe had her jaw thrust out at a mutinous angle. \"You and I -- we're\r\ntogether now. You have to understand that.\"\r\n\r\nWe sat down on the bed together.\r\n\r\n\"Unless you don't want me,\" she said, finally, in a small voice.\r\n\r\n\"You're kidding me, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do I look like I'm kidding?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no way I would voluntarily go without you, Ange. I could never\r\nhave asked you to come, but I'm ecstatic that you offered.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled and tossed me my keyboard.\r\n\r\n\"Email this Masha creature. Let's see what this chick can do for us.\"\r\n\r\nI emailed her, encrypting the message, waiting for a reply. Ange\r\nnuzzled me a little and I kissed her and we necked. Something about the\r\ndanger and the pact to go together -- it made me forget the awkwardness\r\nof having sex, made me freaking horny as hell.\r\n\r\nWe were half naked again when Masha's email arrived.\r\n\r\n> Two of you? Jesus, like it won't be hard enough already.\r\n\r\n> I don't get to leave except to do field intelligence after a big Xnet\r\n> hit. You get me? The handlers watch my every move, but I go off the\r\n> leash when something big happens with Xnetters. I get sent into the\r\n> field then. \r\n\r\n> You do something big. I get sent to it. I get us both out. All three\r\n> of us, if you insist. \r\n\r\n> Make it fast, though. I can't send you a lot of email, understand?\r\n> They watch me. They're closing in on you. You don't have a lot of\r\n> time. Weeks? Maybe just days. \r\n\r\n> I need you to get me out. That's why I'm doing this, in case you're\r\n> wondering. I can't escape on my own. I need a big Xnet distraction.\r\n> That's your department. Don't fail me, M1k3y, or we're both dead.\r\n> Your girlie too.\r\n\r\n> Masha\r\n\r\nMy phone rang, making us both jump. It was my mom wanting to know when\r\nI was coming home. I told her I was on my way. She didn't mention\r\nBarbara. We'd agreed that we wouldn't talk about any of this stuff on\r\nthe phone. That was my dad's idea. He could be as paranoid as me.\r\n\r\n\"I have to go,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Our parents will be --\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" I said. \"I saw what happened to my parents when they thought\r\nI was dead. Knowing that I'm a fugitive isn't going to be much better.\r\nBut they'd rather I be a fugitive than a prisoner. That's what I think.\r\nAnyway, once we disappear, Barbara can publish without worrying about\r\ngetting us into trouble.\"\r\n\r\nWe kissed at the door of her room. Not one of the hot, sloppy numbers\r\nwe usually did when parting ways. A sweet kiss this time. A slow kiss.\r\nA goodbye kind of kiss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBART rides are introspective. When the train rocks back and forth and\r\nyou try not to make eye contact with the other riders and you try not\r\nto read the ads for plastic surgery, bail bondsmen and AIDS testing,\r\nwhen you try to ignore the graffiti and not look too closely at the\r\nstuff in the carpeting. That's when your mind starts to really churn\r\nand churn.\r\n\r\nYou rock back and forth and your mind goes over all the things you've\r\noverlooked, plays back all the movies of your life where you're no\r\nhero, where you're a chump or a sucker.\r\n\r\nYour brain comes up with theories like this one:\r\n\r\n*If the DHS wanted to catch M1k3y, what better way than to lure him\r\ninto the open, panic him into leading some kind of big, public Xnet\r\nevent? Wouldn't that be worth the chance of a compromising video\r\nleaking?*\r\n\r\nYour brain comes up with stuff like that even when the train ride only\r\nlasts two or three stops. When you get off, and you start moving, the\r\nblood gets running and sometimes your brain helps you out again.\r\n\r\nSometimes your brain gives you solutions in addition to problems.\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nChapter 18\r\n\r\n[[This chapter is dedicated to Vancouver's multilingual Sophia Books, a\r\ndiverse and exciting store filled with the best of the strange and\r\nexciting pop culture worlds of many lands. Sophia was around the corner\r\nfrom my hotel when I went to Van to give a talk at Simon Fraser\r\nUniversity, and the Sophia folks emailed me in advance to ask me to\r\ndrop in and sign their stock while I was in the neighborhood. When I\r\ngot there, I discovered a treasure-trove of never-before-seen works in\r\na dizzying array of languages, from graphic novels to thick academic\r\ntreatises, presided over by good-natured (even slapstick) staff who so\r\npalpably enjoyed their jobs that it spread to every customer who\r\nstepped through the door.]]\r\n\r\n[[Sophia Books http://www.sophiabooks.com/ 450 West Hastings St.,\r\nVancouver, BC Canada V6B1L1 +1 604 684 0484]]\r\n\r\nThere was a time when my favorite thing in the world was putting on a\r\ncape and hanging out in hotels, pretending to be an invisible vampire\r\nwhom everyone stared at.\r\n\r\nIt's complicated, and not nearly as weird as it sounds. The Live Action\r\nRole Playing scene combines the best aspects of D&D with drama club\r\nwith going to sci-fi cons.\r\n\r\nI understand that this might not make it sound as appealing to you as\r\nit was to me when I was 14.\r\n\r\nThe best games were the ones at the Scout Camps out of town: a hundred\r\nteenagers, boys and girls, fighting the Friday night traffic, swapping\r\nstories, playing handheld games, showing off for hours. Then debarking\r\nto stand in the grass before a group of older men and women in bad-ass,\r\nhome-made armor, dented and scarred, like armor must have been in the\r\nold days, not like it's portrayed in the movies, but like a soldier's\r\nuniform after a month in the bush.\r\n\r\nThese people were nominally paid to run the games, but you didn't get\r\nthe job unless you were the kind of person who'd do it for free. They'd\r\nhave already divided us into teams based on the questionnaires we'd\r\nfilled in beforehand, and we'd get our team assignments then, like\r\nbeing called up for baseball sides.\r\n\r\nThen you'd get your briefing packages. These were like the briefings\r\nthe spies get in the movies: here's your identity, here's your mission,\r\nhere's the secrets you know about the group.\r\n\r\nFrom there, it was time for dinner: roaring fires, meat popping on\r\nspits, tofu sizzling on skillets (it's northern California, a\r\nvegetarian option is not optional), and a style of eating and drinking\r\nthat can only be described as quaffing.\r\n\r\nAlready, the keen kids would be getting into character. My first game,\r\nI was a wizard. I had a bag of beanbags that represented spells -- when\r\nI threw one, I would shout the name of the spell I was casting --\r\nfireball, magic missile, cone of light -- and the player or \"monster\" I\r\nthrew it at would keel over if I connected. Or not -- sometimes we had\r\nto call in a ref to mediate, but for the most part, we were all pretty\r\ngood about playing fair. No one liked a dice lawyer.\r\n\r\nBy bedtime, we were all in character. At 14, I wasn't super-sure what a\r\nwizard was supposed to sound like, but I could take my cues from the\r\nmovies and novels. I spoke in slow, measured tones, keeping my face\r\ncomposed in a suitably mystical expression, and thinking mystical\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nThe mission was complicated, retrieving a sacred relic that had been\r\nstolen by an ogre who was bent on subjugating the people of the land to\r\nhis will. It didn't really matter a whole lot. What mattered was that I\r\nhad a private mission, to capture a certain kind of imp to serve as my\r\nfamiliar, and that I had a secret nemesis, another player on the team\r\nwho had taken part in a raid that killed my family when I was a boy, a\r\nplayer who didn't know that I'd come back, bent on revenge. Somewhere,\r\nof course, there was another player with a similar grudge against me,\r\nso that even as I was enjoying the camaraderie of the team, I'd always\r\nhave to keep an eye open for a knife in the back, poison in the food.\r\n\r\nFor the next two days, we played it out. There were parts of the\r\nweekend that were like hide-and-seek, some that were like wilderness\r\nsurvival exercises, some that were like solving crossword puzzles. The\r\ngame-masters had done a great job. And you really got to be friends\r\nwith the other people on the mission. Darryl was the target of my first\r\nmurder, and I put my back into it, even though he was my pal. Nice guy.\r\nShame I'd have to kill him.\r\n\r\nI fireballed him as he was seeking out treasure after we wiped out a\r\nband of orcs, playing rock-papers-scissors with each orc to determine\r\nwho would prevail in combat. This is a lot more exciting than it\r\nsounds.\r\n\r\nIt was like summer camp for drama geeks. We talked until late at night\r\nin tents, looked at the stars, jumped in the river when we got hot,\r\nslapped away mosquitos. Became best friends, or lifelong enemies.\r\n\r\nI don't know why Charles's parents sent him LARPing. He wasn't the kind\r\nof kid who really enjoyed that kind of thing. He was more the\r\npulling-wings-off-flies type. Oh, maybe not. But he just was not into\r\nbeing in costume in the woods. He spent the whole time mooching around,\r\nsneering at everyone and everything, trying to convince us all that we\r\nweren't having the good time we all felt like we were having. You've no\r\ndoubt found that kind of person before, the kind of person who is\r\ncompelled to ensure that everyone else has a rotten time.\r\n\r\nThe other thing about Charles was that he couldn't get the hang of\r\nsimulated combat. Once you start running around the woods and playing\r\nthese elaborate, semi-military games, it's easy to get totally\r\nadrenalized to the point where you're ready to tear out someone's\r\nthroat. This is not a good state to be in when you're carrying a prop\r\nsword, club, pike or other utensil. This is why no one is ever allowed\r\nto hit anyone, under any circumstances, in these games. Instead, when\r\nyou get close enough to someone to fight, you play a quick couple\r\nrounds of rock-paper-scissors, with modifiers based on your experience,\r\narmaments, and condition. The referees mediate disputes. It's quite\r\ncivilized, and a little weird. You go running after someone through the\r\nwoods, catch up with him, bare your teeth, and sit down to play a\r\nlittle roshambo. But it works -- and it keeps everything safe and fun.\r\n\r\nCharles couldn't really get the hang of this. I think he was perfectly\r\ncapable of understanding that the rule was no contact, but he was\r\nsimultaneously capable of deciding that the rule didn't matter, and\r\nthat he wasn't going to abide by it. The refs called him on it a bunch\r\nof times over the weekend, and he kept on promising to stick by it, and\r\nkept on going back. He was one of the bigger kids there already, and he\r\nwas fond of \"accidentally\" tackling you at the end of a chase. Not fun\r\nwhen you get tackled into the rocky forest floor.\r\n\r\nI had just mightily smote Darryl in a little clearing where he'd been\r\ntreasure-hunting, and we were having a little laugh over my extreme\r\nsneakiness. He was going to go monstering -- killed players could\r\nswitch to playing monsters, which meant that the longer the game wore\r\non, the more monsters there were coming after you, meaning that\r\neveryone got to keep on playing and the game's battles just got more\r\nand more epic.\r\n\r\nThat was when Charles came out of the woods behind me and tackled me,\r\nthrowing me to the ground so hard that I couldn't breathe for a moment.\r\n\"Gotcha!\" he yelled. I only knew him slightly before this, and I'd\r\nnever thought much of him, but now I was ready for murder. I climbed\r\nslowly to my feet and looked at him, his chest heaving, grinning.\r\n\"You're so dead,\" he said. \"I totally got you.\"\r\n\r\nI smiled and something felt wrong and sore in my face. I touched my\r\nupper lip. It was bloody. My nose was bleeding and my lip was split,\r\ncut on a root I'd face-planted into when he tackled me.\r\n\r\nI wiped the blood on my pants-leg and smiled. I made like I thought\r\nthat it was all in fun. I laughed a little. I moved towards him.\r\n\r\nCharles wasn't fooled. He was already backing away, trying to fade into\r\nthe woods. Darryl moved to flank him. I took the other flank. Abruptly,\r\nhe turned and ran. Darryl's foot hooked his ankle and sent him\r\nsprawling. We rushed him, just in time to hear a ref's whistle.\r\n\r\nThe ref hadn't seen Charles foul me, but he'd seen Charles's play that\r\nweekend. He sent Charles back to the camp entrance and told him he was\r\nout of the game. Charles complained mightily, but to our satisfaction,\r\nthe ref wasn't having any of it. Once Charles had gone, he gave *us*\r\nboth a lecture, too, telling us that our retaliation was no more\r\njustified than Charles's attack.\r\n\r\nIt was OK. That night, once the games had ended, we all got hot showers\r\nin the scout dorms. Darryl and I stole Charles's clothes and towel. We\r\ntied them in knots and dropped them in the urinal. A lot of the boys\r\nwere happy to contribute to the effort of soaking them. Charles had\r\nbeen very enthusiastic about his tackles.\r\n\r\nI wish I could have watched him when he got out of his shower and\r\ndiscovered his clothes. It's a hard decision: do you run naked across\r\nthe camp, or pick apart the tight, piss-soaked knots in your clothes\r\nand then put them on?\r\n\r\nHe chose nudity. I probably would have chosen the same. We lined up\r\nalong the route from the showers to the shed where the packs were\r\nstored and applauded him. I was at the front of the line, leading the\r\napplause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Scout Camp weekends only came three or four times a year, which\r\nleft Darryl and me -- and lots of other LARPers -- with a serious LARP\r\ndeficiency in our lives.\r\n\r\nLuckily, there were the Wretched Daylight games in the city hotels.\r\nWretched Daylight is another LARP, rival vampire clans and vampire\r\nhunters, and it's got its own quirky rules. Players get cards to help\r\nthem resolve combat skirmishes, so each skirmish involves playing a\r\nlittle hand of a strategic card game. Vampires can become invisible by\r\ncloaking themselves, crossing their arms over their chests, and all the\r\nother players have to pretend they don't see them, continuing on with\r\ntheir conversations about their plans and so on. The true test of a\r\ngood player is whether you're honest enough to go on spilling your\r\nsecrets in front of an \"invisible\" rival without acting as though he\r\nwas in the room.\r\n\r\nThere were a couple of big Wretched Daylight games every month. The\r\norganizers of the games had a good relationship with the city's hotels\r\nand they let it be known that they'd take ten unbooked rooms on Friday\r\nnight and fill them with players who'd run around the hotel, playing\r\nlow-key Wretched Daylight in the corridors, around the pool, and so on,\r\neating at the hotel restaurant and paying for the hotel WiFi. They'd\r\nclose the booking on Friday afternoon, email us, and we'd go straight\r\nfrom school to whichever hotel it was, bringing our knapsacks, sleeping\r\nsix or eight to a room for the weekend, living on junk-food, playing\r\nuntil three AM. It was good, safe fun that our parents could get\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nThe organizers were a well-known literacy charity that ran kids'\r\nwriting workshops, drama workshops and so on. They had been running the\r\ngames for ten years without incident. Everything was strictly booze-\r\nand drug-free, to keep the organizers from getting busted on some kind\r\nof corruption of minors rap. We'd draw between ten and a hundred\r\nplayers, depending on the weekend, and for the cost of a couple movies,\r\nyou could have two and a half days' worth of solid fun.\r\n\r\nOne day, though, they lucked into a block of rooms at the Monaco, a\r\nhotel in the Tenderloin that catered to arty older tourists, the kind\r\nof place where every room came with a goldfish bowl, where the lobby\r\nwas full of beautiful old people in fine clothes, showing off their\r\nplastic surgery results.\r\n\r\nNormally, the mundanes -- our word for non-players -- just ignored us,\r\nfiguring that we were skylarking kids. But that weekend there happened\r\nto be an editor for an Italian travel magazine staying, and he took an\r\ninterest in things. He cornered me as I skulked in the lobby, hoping to\r\nspot the clan-master of my rivals and swoop in on him and draw his\r\nblood. I was standing against the wall with my arms folded over my\r\nchest, being invisible, when he came up to me and asked me, in accented\r\nEnglish, what me and my friends were doing in the hotel that weekend?\r\n\r\nI tried to brush him off, but he wouldn't be put off. So I figured I'd\r\njust make something up and he'd go away.\r\n\r\nI didn't imagine that he'd print it. I really didn't imagine that it\r\nwould get picked up by the American press.\r\n\r\n\"We're here because our prince has died, and so we've had to come in\r\nsearch of a new ruler.\"\r\n\r\n\"A prince?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said, getting into it. \"We're the Old People. We came to\r\nAmerica in the 16th Century and have had our own royal family in the\r\nwilds of Pennsylvania ever since. We live simply in the woods. We don't\r\nuse modern technology. But the prince was the last of the line and he\r\ndied last week. Some terrible wasting disease took him. The young men\r\nof my clan have left to find the descendants of his great-uncle, who\r\nwent away to join the modern people in the time of my grandfather. He\r\nis said to have multiplied, and we will find the last of his bloodline\r\nand bring them back to their rightful home.\"\r\n\r\nI read a lot of fantasy novels. This kind of thing came easily to me.\r\n\r\n\"We found a woman who knew of these descendants. She told us one was\r\nstaying in this hotel, and we've come to find him. But we've been\r\ntracked here by a rival clan who would keep us from bringing home our\r\nprince, to keep us weak and easy to dominate. Thus it is vital we keep\r\nto ourselves. We do not talk to the New People when we can help it.\r\nTalking to you now causes me great discomfort.\"\r\n\r\nHe was watching me shrewdly. I had uncrossed my arms, which meant that\r\nI was now \"visible\" to rival vampires, one of whom had been slowly\r\nsneaking up on us. At the last moment, I turned and saw her, arms\r\nspread, hissing at us, vamping it up in high style.\r\n\r\nI threw my arms wide and hissed back at her, then pelted through the\r\nlobby, hopping over a leather sofa and deking around a potted plant,\r\nmaking her chase me. I'd scouted an escape route down through the\r\nstairwell to the basement health-club and I took it, shaking her off.\r\n\r\nI didn't see him again that weekend, but I *did* relate the story to\r\nsome of my fellow LARPers, who embroidered the tale and found lots of\r\nopportunities to tell it over the weekend.\r\n\r\nThe Italian magazine had a staffer who'd done her master's degree on\r\nAmish anti-technology communities in rural Pennsylvania, and she\r\nthought we sounded awfully interesting. Based on the notes and taped\r\ninterviews of her boss from his trip to San Francisco, she wrote a\r\nfascinating, heart-wrenching article about these weird, juvenile\r\ncultists who were crisscrossing America in search of their \"prince.\"\r\nHell, people will print anything these days.\r\n\r\nBut the thing was, stories like that get picked up and republished.\r\nFirst it was Italian bloggers, then a few American bloggers. People\r\nacross the country reported \"sightings\" of the Old People, though\r\nwhether they were making it up, or whether others were playing the same\r\ngame, I didn't know.\r\n\r\nIt worked its way up the media food-chain all the way to the *New York\r\nTimes*, who, unfortunately, have an unhealthy appetite for\r\nfact-checking. The reporter they put on the story eventually tracked it\r\ndown to the Monaco Hotel, who put them in touch with the LARP\r\norganizers, who laughingly spilled the whole story.\r\n\r\nWell, at that point, LARPing got a lot less cool. We became known as\r\nthe nation's foremost hoaxers, as weird, pathological liars. The press\r\nwho we'd inadvertently tricked into covering the story of the Old\r\nPeople were now interested in redeeming themselves by reporting on how\r\nunbelievably weird we LARPers were, and that was when Charles let\r\neveryone in school know that Darryl and I were the biggest LARPing\r\nweenies in the city.\r\n\r\nThat was not a good season. Some of the gang didn't mind, but we did.\r\nThe teasing was merciless. Charles led it. I'd find plastic fangs in my\r\nbag, and kids I passed in the hall would go \"bleh, bleh\" like a cartoon\r\nvampire, or they'd talk with fake Transylvanian accents when I was\r\naround.\r\n\r\nWe switched to ARGing pretty soon afterwards. It was more fun in some\r\nways, and it was a lot less weird. Every now and again, though, I\r\nmissed my cape and those weekends in the hotel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opposite of esprit d'escalier is the way that life's embarrassments\r\ncome back to haunt us even after they're long past. I could remember\r\nevery stupid thing I'd ever said or done, recall them with\r\npicture-perfect clarity. Any time I was feeling low, I'd naturally\r\nstart to remember other times I felt that way, a hit-parade of\r\nhumiliations coming one after another to my mind.\r\n\r\nAs I tried to concentrate on Masha and my impending doom, the Old\r\nPeople incident kept coming back to haunt me. There'd been a similar,\r\nsick, sinking doomed feeling then, as more and more press outlets\r\npicked up the story, as the likelihood increased of someone figuring\r\nout that it had been me who'd sprung the story on the stupid Italian\r\neditor in the designer jeans with crooked seams, the starched\r\ncollarless shirt, and the oversized metal-rimmed glasses.\r\n\r\nThere's an alternative to dwelling on your mistakes. You can learn from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt's a good theory, anyway. Maybe the reason your subconscious dredges\r\nup all these miserable ghosts is that they need to get closure before\r\nthey can rest peacefully in humiliation afterlife. My subconscious kept\r\nvisiting me with ghosts in the hopes that I would do something to let\r\nthem rest in peace.\r\n\r\nAll the way home, I turned over this memory and the thought of what I\r\nwould do about \"Masha,\" in case she was playing me. I needed some\r\ninsurance.\r\n\r\nAnd by the time I reached my house -- to be swept up into melancholy\r\nhugs from Mom and Dad -- I had it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trick was to time this so that it happened fast enough that the DHS\r\ncouldn't prepare for it, but with a long enough lead time that the Xnet\r\nwould have time to turn out in force.\r\n\r\nThe trick was to stage this so that there were too many present to\r\narrest us all, but to put it somewhere that the press could see it and\r\nthe grownups, so the DHS wouldn't just gas us again.\r\n\r\nThe trick was to come up with something with the media friendliness of\r\nthe levitation of the Pentagon. The trick was to stage something that\r\nwe could rally around, like 3,000 Berkeley students refusing to let one\r\nof their number be taken away in a police van.\r\n\r\nThe trick was to put the press there, ready to say what the police did,\r\nthe way they had in 1968 in Chicago.\r\n\r\nIt was going to be some trick.\r\n\r\nI cut out of school an hour early the next day, using my customary\r\ntechniques for getting out, not caring if it would trigger some kind of\r\nnew DHS checker that would result in my parents getting a note.\r\n\r\nOne way or another, my parents' last problem after tomorrow would be\r\nwhether I was in trouble at school.\r\n\r\nI met Ange at her place. She'd had to cut out of school even earlier,\r\nbut she'd just made a big deal out of her cramps and pretended she was\r\ngoing to keel over and they sent her home.\r\n\r\nWe started to spread the word on Xnet. We sent it in email to trusted\r\nfriends, and IMmed it to our buddy lists. We roamed the decks and towns\r\nof Clockwork Plunder and told our team-mates. Giving everyone enough\r\ninformation to get them to show up but not so much as to tip our hand\r\nto the DHS was tricky, but I thought I had just the right balance:\r\n\r\n> VAMPMOB TOMORROW \r\n\r\n> If you're a goth, dress to impress. If you're not a goth, find a goth\r\n> and borrow some clothes. Think vampire.\r\n\r\n> The game starts at 8:00AM sharp. SHARP. Be there and ready to be\r\n> divided into teams. The game lasts 30 minutes, so you'll have plenty\r\n> of time to get to school afterward.\r\n\r\n> Location will be revealed tomorrow. Email your public key to\r\n> m1k3y@littlebrother.pirateparty.org.se and check your messages at 7AM\r\n> for the update. If that's too early for you, stay up all night.\r\n> That's what we're going to do.\r\n\r\n> This is the most fun you will have all year, guaranteed. \r\n\r\n> Believe.\r\n\r\n> M1k3y\r\n\r\nThen I sent a short message to Masha.\r\n\r\n> Tomorrow\r\n\r\n> M1k3y\r\n\r\nA minute later, she emailed back:\r\n\r\n> I thought so. VampMob, huh? You work fast. Wear a red hat. Travel\r\n> light. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you bring along when you go fugitive? I'd carried enough heavy\r\npacks around enough scout camps to know that every ounce you add cuts\r\ninto your shoulders with all the crushing force of gravity with every\r\nstep you take -- it's not just one ounce, it's one ounce that you carry\r\nfor a million steps. It's a ton.\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" Ange said. \"Smart. And you never take more than three days'\r\nworth of clothes, either. You can rinse stuff out in the sink. Better\r\nto have a spot on your t-shirt than a suitcase that's too big and heavy\r\nto stash under a plane-seat.\"\r\n\r\nShe'd pulled out a ballistic nylon courier bag that went across her\r\nchest, between her breasts -- something that made me get a little\r\nsweaty -- and slung diagonally across her back. It was roomy inside,\r\nand she'd set it down on the bed. Now she was piling clothes next to\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"I figure that three t-shirts, a pair of pants, a pair of shorts, three\r\nchanges of underwear, three pairs of socks and a sweater will do it.\"\r\n\r\nShe dumped out her gym bag and picked out her toiletries. \"I'll have to\r\nremember to stick my toothbrush in tomorrow morning before I head down\r\nto Civic Center.\"\r\n\r\nWatching her pack was impressive. She was ruthless about it all. It was\r\nalso freaky -- it made me realize that the next day, I was going to go\r\naway. Maybe for a long time. Maybe forever.\r\n\r\n\"Do I bring my Xbox?\" she asked. \"I've got a ton of stuff on the\r\nhard-drive, notes and sketches and email. I wouldn't want it to fall\r\ninto the wrong hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all encrypted,\" I said. \"That's standard with ParanoidXbox. But\r\nleave the Xbox behind, there'll be plenty of them in LA. Just create a\r\nPirate Party account and email an image of your hard-drive to yourself.\r\nI'm going to do the same when I get home.\"\r\n\r\nShe did so, and queued up the email. It was going to take a couple\r\nhours for all the data to squeeze through her neighbor's WiFi network\r\nand wing its way to Sweden.\r\n\r\nThen she closed the flap on the bag and tightened the compression\r\nstraps. She had something the size of a soccer-ball slung over her back\r\nnow, and I stared admiringly at it. She could walk down the street with\r\nthat under her shoulder and no one would look twice -- she looked like\r\nshe was on her way to school.\r\n\r\n\"One more thing,\" she said, and went to her bedside table and took out\r\nthe condoms. She took the strips of rubbers out of the box and opened\r\nthe bag and stuck them inside, then gave me a slap on the ass.\r\n\r\n\"Now what?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Now we go to your place and do your stuff. It's time I met your\r\nparents, no?\"\r\n\r\nShe left the bag amid the piles of clothes and junk all over the floor.\r\nShe was ready to turn her back on all of it, walk away, just to be with\r\nme. Just to support the cause. It made me feel brave, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMom was already home when I got there. She had her laptop open on the\r\nkitchen table and was answering email while talking into a headset\r\nconnected to it, helping some poor Yorkshireman and his family\r\nacclimate to living in Louisiana.\r\n\r\nI came through the door and Ange followed, grinning like mad, but\r\nholding my hand so tight I could feel the bones grinding together. I\r\ndidn't know what she was so worried about. It wasn't like she was going\r\nto end up spending a lot of time hanging around with my parents after\r\nthis, even if it went badly.\r\n\r\nMom hung up on the Yorkshireman when we got in.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Marcus,\" she said, giving me a kiss on the cheek. \"And who is\r\nthis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mom, meet Ange. Ange, this is my Mom, Lillian.\" Mom stood up and gave\r\nAnge a hug.\r\n\r\n\"It's very good to meet you, darling,\" she said, looking her over from\r\ntop to bottom. Ange looked pretty acceptable, I think. She dressed\r\nwell, and low-key, and you could tell how smart she was just by looking\r\nat her.\r\n\r\n\"A pleasure to meet you, Mrs Yallow,\" she said. She sounded very\r\nconfident and self-assured. Much better than I had when I'd met her\r\nmom.\r\n\r\n\"It's Lillian, love,\" she said. She was taking in every detail. \"Are\r\nyou staying for dinner?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd love that,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Do you eat meat?\" Mom's pretty acclimated to living in California.\r\n\r\n\"I eat anything that doesn't eat me first,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"She's a hot-sauce junkie,\" I said. \"You could serve her old tires and\r\nshe'd eat 'em if she could smother them in salsa.\"\r\n\r\nAnge socked me gently in the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"I was going to order Thai,\" Mom said. \"I'll add a couple of their\r\nfive-chili dishes to the order.\"\r\n\r\nAnge thanked her politely and Mom bustled around the kitchen, getting\r\nus glasses of juice and a plate of biscuits and asking three times if\r\nwe wanted any tea. I squirmed a little.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Mom,\" I said. \"We're going to go upstairs for a while.\"\r\n\r\nMom's eyes narrowed for a second, then she smiled again. \"Of course,\"\r\nshe said. \"Your father will be home in an hour, we'll eat then.\"\r\n\r\nI had my vampire stuff all stashed in the back of my closet. I let Ange\r\nsort through it while I went through my clothes. I was only going as\r\nfar as LA. They had stores there, all the clothing I could need. I just\r\nneeded to get together three or four favorite tees and a favorite pair\r\nof jeans, a tube of deodorant, a roll of dental floss.\r\n\r\n\"Money!\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" she said. \"I was going to clean out my bank account on the way\r\nhome at an ATM. I've got maybe five hundred saved up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really?\"\r\n\r\n\"What am I going to spend it on?\" she said. \"Ever since the Xnet, I\r\nhaven't had to even pay any service charges.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I've got three hundred or so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there you go. Grab it on the way to Civic Center in the\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\nI had a big book-bag I used when I was hauling lots of gear around\r\ntown. It was less conspicuous than my camping pack. Ange went through\r\nmy piles mercilessly and culled them down to her favorites.\r\n\r\nOnce it was packed and under my bed, we both sat down.\r\n\r\n\"We're going to have to get up really early tomorrow,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, big day.\"\r\n\r\nThe plan was to get messages out with a bunch of fake VampMob locations\r\ntomorrow, sending people out to secluded spots within a few minutes'\r\nwalk of Civic Center. We'd cut out a spray-paint stencil that just said\r\nVAMPMOB CIVIC CENTER -> -> that we would spray-paint at those spots\r\naround 5AM. That would keep the DHS from locking down the Civic Center\r\nbefore we got there. I had the mailbot ready to send out the messages\r\nat 7AM -- I'd just leave my Xbox running when I went out.\r\n\r\n\"How long. . .\" She trailed off.\r\n\r\n\"That's what I've been wondering, too,\" I said. \"It could be a long\r\ntime, I suppose. But who knows? With Barbara's article coming out --\"\r\nI'd queued an email to her for the next morning, too -- \"and all, maybe\r\nwe'll be heroes in two weeks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe,\" she said and sighed.\r\n\r\nI put my arm around her. Her shoulders were shaking.\r\n\r\n\"I'm terrified,\" I said. \"I think that it would be crazy not to be\r\nterrified.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" she said. \"Yeah.\"\r\n\r\nMom called us to dinner. Dad shook Ange's hand. He looked unshaved and\r\nworried, the way he had since we'd gone to see Barbara, but on meeting\r\nAnge, a little of the old Dad came back. She kissed him on the cheek\r\nand he insisted that she call him Drew.\r\n\r\nDinner was actually really good. The ice broke when Ange took out her\r\nhot-sauce mister and treated her plate, and explained about Scoville\r\nunits. Dad tried a forkful of her food and went reeling into the\r\nkitchen to drink a gallon of milk. Believe it or not, Mom still tried\r\nit after that and gave every impression of loving it. Mom, it turned\r\nout, was an undiscovered spicy food prodigy, a natural.\r\n\r\nBefore she left, Ange pressed the hot-sauce mister on Mom. \"I have a\r\nspare at home,\" she said. I'd watched her pack it in her backpack. \"You\r\nseem like the kind of woman who should have one of these.\"\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nChapter 19\r\n\r\n[[This chapter is dedicated to the MIT Press Bookshop, a store I've\r\nvisited on every single trip to Boston over the past ten years.

You've discovered the\r\n> secret of surviving the terrible light of the sun. The secret was\r\n> cannibalism: the blood of another vampire can give you the strength\r\n> to walk among the living.\r\n\r\n> You need to bite as many other vampires as you can in order to stay\r\n> in the game. If one minute goes by without a bite, you're out. Once\r\n> you're out, turn your shirt around backwards and go referee -- watch\r\n> two or three vamps to see if they're getting their bites in.\r\n\r\n> To bite another vamp, you have to say \"Bite!\" five times before they\r\n> do. So you run up to a vamp, make eye-contact, and shout \"bite bite\r\n> bite bite bite!\" and if you get it out before she does, you live and\r\n> she crumbles to dust.\r\n\r\n> You and the other vamps you meet at your rendezvous are a team. They\r\n> are your clan. You derive no nourishment from their blood.\r\n\r\n> You can \"go invisible\" by standing still and folding your arms over\r\n> your chest. You can't bite invisible vamps, and they can't bite you. \r\n\r\n> This game is played on the honor system. The point is to have fun and\r\n> get your vamp on, not to win.\r\n\r\n> There is an end-game that will be passed by word of mouth as winners\r\n> begin to emerge. The game-masters will start a whisper campaign among\r\n> the players when the time comes. Spread the whisper as quickly as you\r\n> can and watch for the sign.\r\n\r\n> M1k3y\r\n\r\n> bite bite bite bite bite!\r\n\r\nWe'd hoped that a hundred people would be willing to play VampMob. We'd\r\nsent out about two hundred invites each. But when I sat bolt upright at\r\n4AM and grabbed my Xbox, there were *400* replies there. Four\r\n*hundred*.\r\n\r\nI fed the addresses to the bot and stole out of the house. I descended\r\nthe stairs, listening to my father snore and my mom rolling over in\r\ntheir bed. I locked the door behind me.\r\n\r\nAt 4:15 AM, Potrero Hill was as quiet as the countryside. There were\r\nsome distant traffic rumbles, and once, a car crawled past me. I\r\nstopped at an ATM and drew out $320 in twenties, rolled them up and put\r\na rubber-band around them, and stuck the roll in a zip-up pocket low on\r\nthe thigh of my vampire pants.\r\n\r\nI was wearing my cape again, and a ruffled shirt, and tuxedo pants that\r\nhad been modded to have enough pockets to carry all my little bits and\r\npieces. I had on pointed boots with silver-skull buckles, and I'd\r\nteased my hair into a black dandelion clock around my head. Ange was\r\nbringing the white makeup and had promised to do my eyeliner and black\r\nnail-polish. Why the hell not? When was the next time I was going to\r\nget to play dressup like this?\r\n\r\nAnge met me in front of her house. She had her backpack on too, and\r\nfishnet tights, a ruffled gothic lolita maid's dress, white face-paint,\r\nelaborate kabuki eye-makeup, and her fingers and throat dripped with\r\nsilver jewelry.\r\n\r\n\"You look *great*!\" we said to each other in unison, then laughed\r\nquietly and stole off through the streets, spray-paint cans in our\r\npockets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I surveyed Civic Center, I thought about what it would look like\r\nonce 400 VampMobbers converged on it. I expected them in ten minutes,\r\nout front of City Hall. Already the big plaza teemed with commuters who\r\nneatly sidestepped the homeless people begging there.\r\n\r\nI've always hated Civic Center. It's a collection of huge wedding-cake\r\nbuildings: court houses, museums, and civic buildings like City Hall.\r\nThe sidewalks are wide, the buildings are white. In the tourist guides\r\nto San Francisco, they manage to photograph it so that it looks like\r\nEpcot Center, futuristic and austere.\r\n\r\nBut on the ground, it's grimy and gross. Homeless people sleep on all\r\nthe benches. The district is empty by 6PM except for drunks and\r\ndruggies, because with only one kind of building there, there's no\r\nlegit reason for people to hang around after the sun goes down. It's\r\nmore like a mall than a neighborhood, and the only businesses there are\r\nbail-bondsmen and liquor stores, places that cater to the families of\r\ncrooks on trial and the bums who make it their nighttime home.\r\n\r\nI really came to understand all of this when I read an interview with\r\nan amazing old urban planner, a woman called Jane Jacobs who was the\r\nfirst person to really nail why it was wrong to slice cities up with\r\nfreeways, stick all the poor people in housing projects, and use zoning\r\nlaws to tightly control who got to do what where.\r\n\r\nJacobs explained that real cities are organic and they have a lot of\r\nvariety -- rich and poor, white and brown, Anglo and Mex, retail and\r\nresidential and even industrial. A neighborhood like that has all kinds\r\nof people passing through it at all hours of the day or night, so you\r\nget businesses that cater to every need, you get people around all the\r\ntime, acting like eyes on the street.\r\n\r\nYou've encountered this before. You go walking around some older part\r\nof some city and you find that it's full of the coolest looking stores,\r\nguys in suits and people in fashion-rags, upscale restaurants and funky\r\ncafes, a little movie theater maybe, houses with elaborate paint-jobs.\r\nSure, there might be a Starbucks too, but there's also a neat-looking\r\nfruit market and a florist who appears to be three hundred years old as\r\nshe snips carefully at the flowers in her windows. It's the opposite of\r\na planned space, like a mall. It feels like a wild garden or even a\r\nwoods: like it *grew*.\r\n\r\nYou couldn't get any further from that than Civic Center. I read an\r\ninterview with Jacobs where she talked about the great old neighborhood\r\nthey knocked down to build it. It had been just that kind of\r\nneighborhood, the kind of place that happened without permission or\r\nrhyme or reason.\r\n\r\nJacobs said that she predicted that within a few years, Civic Center\r\nwould be one of the worst neighborhoods in the city, a ghost-town at\r\nnight, a place that sustained a thin crop of weedy booze shops and\r\nflea-pit motels. In the interview, she didn't seem very glad to have\r\nbeen vindicated; she sounded like she was talking about a dead friend\r\nwhen she described what Civic Center had become.\r\n\r\nNow it was rush hour and Civic Center was as busy as it could be. The\r\nCivic Center BART also serves as the major station for Muni trolley\r\nlines, and if you need to switch from one to another, that's where you\r\ndo it. At 8AM, there were thousands of people coming up the stairs,\r\ngoing down the stairs, getting into and out of taxis and on and off\r\nbuses. They got squeezed by DHS checkpoints by the different civic\r\nbuildings, and routed around aggressive panhandlers. They all smelled\r\nlike their shampoos and colognes, fresh out of the shower and armored\r\nin their work suits, swinging laptop bags and briefcases. At 8AM, Civic\r\nCenter was business central.\r\n\r\nAnd here came the vamps. A couple dozen coming down Van Ness, a couple\r\ndozen coming up Market. More coming from the other side of Market. More\r\ncoming up from Van Ness. They slipped around the side of the buildings,\r\nwearing the white face-paint and the black eyeliner, black clothes,\r\nleather jackets, huge stompy boots. Fishnet fingerless gloves.\r\n\r\nThey began to fill up the plaza. A few of the business people gave them\r\npassing glances and then looked away, not wanting to let these weirdos\r\ninto their personal realities as they thought about whatever crap they\r\nwere about to wade through for another eight hours. The vamps milled\r\naround, not sure when the game was on. They pooled together in large\r\ngroups, like an oil spill in reverse, all this black gathering in one\r\nplace. A lot of them sported old-timey hats, bowlers and toppers. Many\r\nof the girls were in full-on elegant gothic lolita maid costumes with\r\nhuge platforms.\r\n\r\nI tried to estimate the numbers. 200. Then, five minutes later, it was\r\n300. 400. They were still streaming in. The vamps had brought friends.\r\n\r\nSomeone grabbed my ass. I spun around and saw Ange, laughing so hard\r\nshe had to hold her thighs, bent double.\r\n\r\n\"Look at them all, man, look at them all!\" she gasped. The square was\r\ntwice as crowded as it had been a few minutes ago. I had no idea how\r\nmany Xnetters there were, but easily 1000 of them had just showed up to\r\nmy little party. Christ.\r\n\r\nThe DHS and SFPD cops were starting to mill around, talking into their\r\nradios and clustering together. I heard a far-away siren.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" I said, shaking Ange by the arm. \"All right, let's *go*.\"\r\n\r\nWe both slipped off into the crowd and as soon as we encountered our\r\nfirst vamp, we both said, loudly, \"Bite bite bite bite bite!\" My victim\r\nwas a stunned -- but cute -- girl with spider-webs drawn on her hands\r\nand smudged mascara running down her cheeks. She said, \"Crap,\" and\r\nmoved away, acknowledging that I'd gotten her.\r\n\r\nThe call of \"bite bite bite bite bite\" had scrambled the other nearby\r\nvamps. Some of them were attacking each other, others were moving for\r\ncover, hiding out. I had my victim for the minute, so I skulked away,\r\nusing mundanes for cover. All around me, the cry of \"bite bite bite\r\nbite bite!\" and shouts and laughs and curses.\r\n\r\nThe sound spread like a virus through the crowd. All the vamps knew the\r\ngame was on now, and the ones who were clustered together were dropping\r\nlike flies. They laughed and cussed and moved away, clueing the\r\nstill-in vamps that the game was on. And more vamps were arriving by\r\nthe second.\r\n\r\n8:16. It was time to bag another vamp. I crouched low and moved through\r\nthe legs of the straights as they headed for the BART stairs. They\r\njerked back with surprise and swerved to avoid me. I had my eyes\r\nlaser-locked on a set of black platform boots with steel dragons over\r\nthe toes, and so I wasn't expecting it when I came face to face with\r\nanother vamp, a guy of about 15 or 16, hair gelled straight back and\r\nwearing a PVC Marilyn Manson jacket draped with necklaces of fake tusks\r\ncarved with intricate symbols.\r\n\r\n\"Bite bite bite --\" he began, when one of the mundanes tripped over him\r\nand they both went sprawling. I leapt over to him and shouted \"bite\r\nbite bite bite bite!\" before he could untangle himself again.\r\n\r\nMore vamps were arriving. The suits were really freaking out. The game\r\noverflowed the sidewalk and moved into Van Ness, spreading up toward\r\nMarket Street. Drivers honked, the trolleys made angry *ding*s. I heard\r\nmore sirens, but now traffic was snarled in every direction.\r\n\r\nIt was freaking *glorious*.\r\n\r\nBITE BITE BITE BITE BITE!\r\n\r\nThe sound came from all around me. There were so many vamps there,\r\nplaying so furiously, it was like a roar. I risked standing up and\r\nlooking around and found that I was right in the middle of a giant\r\ncrowd of vamps that went as far as I could see in every direction.\r\n\r\nBITE BITE BITE BITE BITE!\r\n\r\nThis was even better than the concert in Dolores Park. That had been\r\nangry and rockin', but this was -- well, it was just *fun*. It was like\r\ngoing back to the playground, to the epic games of tag we'd play on\r\nlunch breaks when the sun was out, hundreds of people chasing each\r\nother around. The adults and the cars just made it more fun, more\r\nfunny.\r\n\r\nThat's what it was: it was *funny*. We were all laughing now.\r\n\r\nBut the cops were really mobilizing now. I heard helicopters. Any\r\nsecond now, it would be over. Time for the endgame.\r\n\r\nI grabbed a vamp.\r\n\r\n\"Endgame: when the cops order us to disperse, pretend you've been\r\ngassed. Pass it on. What did I just say?\"\r\n\r\nThe vamp was a girl, tiny, so short I thought she was really young, but\r\nshe must have been 17 or 18 from her face and the smile. \"Oh, that's\r\nwicked,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"What did I say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Endgame: when the cops order us to disperse, pretend you've been\r\ngassed. Pass it on. What did I just say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" I said. \"Pass it on.\"\r\n\r\nShe melted into the crowd. I grabbed another vamp. I passed it on. He\r\nwent off to pass it on.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in the crowd, I knew Ange was doing this too. Somewhere in\r\nthe crowd, there might be infiltrators, fake Xnetters, but what could\r\nthey do with this knowledge? It's not like the cops had a choice. They\r\nwere going to order us to disperse. That was guaranteed.\r\n\r\nI had to get to Ange. The plan was to meet at the Founder's Statue in\r\nthe Plaza, but reaching it was going to be hard. The crowd wasn't\r\nmoving anymore, it was *surging*, like the mob had in the way down to\r\nthe BART station on the day the bombs went off. I struggled to make my\r\nway through it just as the PA underneath the helicopter switched on.\r\n\r\n\"THIS IS THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. YOU ARE ORDERED TO\r\nDISPERSE IMMEDIATELY.\"\r\n\r\nAround me, hundreds of vamps fell to the ground, clutching their\r\nthroats, clawing at their eyes, gasping for breath. It was easy to fake\r\nbeing gassed, we'd all had plenty of time to study the footage of the\r\npartiers in Mission Dolores Park going down under the pepper-spray\r\nclouds.\r\n\r\n\"DISPERSE IMMEDIATELY.\"\r\n\r\nI fell to the ground, protecting my pack, reaching around to the red\r\nbaseball hat folded into the waistband of my pants. I jammed it on my\r\nhead and then grabbed my throat and made horrendous retching noises.\r\n\r\nThe only ones still standing were the mundanes, the salarymen who'd\r\nbeen just trying to get to their jobs. I looked around as best as I\r\ncould at them as I choked and gasped.\r\n\r\n\"THIS IS THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. YOU ARE ORDERED TO\r\nDISPERSE IMMEDIATELY. DISPERSE IMMEDIATELY.\" The voice of god made my\r\nbowels ache. I felt it in my molars and in my femurs and my spine.\r\n\r\nThe salarymen were scared. They were moving as fast as they could, but\r\nin no particular direction. The helicopters seemed to be directly\r\noverhead no matter where you stood. The cops were wading into the crowd\r\nnow, and they'd put on their helmets. Some had shields. Some had gas\r\nmasks. I gasped harder.\r\n\r\nThen the salarymen were running. I probably would have run too. I\r\nwatched a guy whip a $500 jacket off and wrap it around his face before\r\nheading south toward Mission, only to trip up and go sprawling. His\r\ncurses joined the choking sounds.\r\n\r\nThis wasn't supposed to happen -- the choking was just supposed to\r\nfreak people out and get them confused, not panic them into a stampede.\r\n\r\nThere were screams now, screams I recognized all too well from the\r\nnight in the park. That was the sound of people who were scared\r\nspitless, running into each other as they tried like hell to get away.\r\n\r\nAnd then the air-raid sirens began.\r\n\r\nI hadn't heard that sound since the bombs went off, but I would never\r\nforget it. It sliced through me and went straight into my balls,\r\nturning my legs into jelly on the way. It made me want to run away in a\r\npanic. I got to my feet, red cap on my head, thinking of only one\r\nthing: Ange. Ange and the Founders' Statue.\r\n\r\nEveryone was on their feet now, running in all directions, screaming. I\r\npushed people out of my way, holding onto my pack and my hat, heading\r\nfor Founders' Statue. Masha was looking for me, I was looking for Ange.\r\nAnge was out there.\r\n\r\nI pushed and cursed. Elbowed someone. Someone came down on my foot so\r\nhard I felt something go *crunch* and I shoved him so he went down. He\r\ntried to get up and someone stepped on him. I shoved and pushed.\r\n\r\nThen I reached out my arm to shove someone else and strong hands\r\ngrabbed my wrist and my elbow in one fluid motion and brought my arm\r\nback around behind my back. It felt like my shoulder was about to\r\nwrench out of its socket, and I instantly doubled over, hollering, a\r\nsound that was barely audible over the din of the crowd, the thrum of\r\nthe choppers, the wail of the sirens.\r\n\r\nI was brought back upright by the strong hands behind me, which steered\r\nme like a marionette. The hold was so perfect I couldn't even think of\r\nsquirming. I couldn't think of the noise or the helicopter or Ange. All\r\nI could think of was moving the way that the person who had me wanted\r\nme to move. I was brought around so that I was face-to-face with the\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nIt was a girl whose face was sharp and rodent-like, half-hidden by a\r\ngiant pair of sunglasses. Over the sunglasses, a mop of bright pink\r\nhair, spiked out in all directions.\r\n\r\n\"You!\" I said. I knew her. She'd taken a picture of me and threatened\r\nto rat me out to truant watch. That had been five minutes before the\r\nalarms started. She'd been the one, ruthless and cunning. We'd both run\r\nfrom that spot in the Tenderloin as the klaxon sounded behind us, and\r\nwe'd both been picked up by the cops. I'd been hostile and they'd\r\ndecided that I was an enemy.\r\n\r\nShe -- Masha -- became their ally.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, M1k3y,\" she hissed in my ear, close as a lover. A shiver went\r\nup my back. She let go of my arm and I shook it out.\r\n\r\n\"Christ,\" I said. \"You!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, me,\" she said. \"The gas is gonna come down in about two minutes.\r\nLet's haul ass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ange -- my girlfriend -- is by the Founders' Statue.\"\r\n\r\nMasha looked over the crowd. \"No chance,\" she said. \"We try to make it\r\nthere, we're doomed. The gas is coming down in two minutes, in case you\r\nmissed it the first time.\"\r\n\r\nI stopped moving. \"I don't go without Ange,\" I said.\r\n\r\nShe shrugged. \"Suit yourself,\" she shouted in my ear. \"Your funeral.\"\r\n\r\nShe began to push through the crowd, moving away, north, toward\r\ndowntown. I continued to push for the Founders' Statue. A second later,\r\nmy arm was back in the terrible lock and I was being swung around and\r\npropelled forward.\r\n\r\n\"You know too much, jerk-off,\" she said. \"You've seen my face. You're\r\ncoming with me.\"\r\n\r\nI screamed at her, struggled till it felt like my arm would break, but\r\nshe was pushing me forward. My sore foot was agony with every step, my\r\nshoulder felt like it would break.\r\n\r\nWith her using me as a battering ram, we made good progress through the\r\ncrowd. The whine of the helicopters changed and she gave me a harder\r\npush. \"RUN!\" she yelled. \"Here comes the gas!\"\r\n\r\nThe crowd noise changed, too. The choking sounds and scream sounds got\r\nmuch, much louder. I'd heard that pitch of sound before. We were back\r\nin the park. The gas was raining down. I held my breath and *ran*.\r\n\r\nWe cleared the crowd and she let go of my arm. I shook it out. I limped\r\nas fast as I could up the sidewalk as the crowd thinned and thinned. We\r\nwere heading towards a group of DHS cops with riot shields and helmets\r\nand masks. As we drew near them, they moved to block us, but Masha held\r\nup a badge and they melted away like she was Obi Wan Kenobi, saying\r\n\"These aren't the droids you're looking for.\"\r\n\r\n\"You goddamned *bitch*,\" I said as we sped up Market Street. \"We have\r\nto go back for Ange.\"\r\n\r\nShe pursed her lips and shook her head. \"I feel for you, buddy. I\r\nhaven't seen my boyfriend in months. He probably thinks I'm dead.\r\nFortunes of war. We go back for your Ange, we're dead. If we push on,\r\nwe have a chance. So long as we have a chance, she has a chance. Those\r\nkids aren't all going to Gitmo. They'll probably take a few hundred in\r\nfor questioning and send the rest home.\"\r\n\r\nWe were moving up Market Street now, past the strip joints where the\r\nlittle encampments of bums and junkies sat, stinking like open toilets.\r\nMasha guided me to a little alcove in the shut door of one of the strip\r\nplaces. She stripped off her jacket and turned it inside out -- the\r\nlining was a muted stripe pattern, and with the jacket's seams\r\nreversed, it hung differently. She produced a wool hat from her pocket\r\nand pulled it over her hair, letting it form a jaunty, off-center peak.\r\nThen she took out some make-up remover wipes and went to work on her\r\nface and fingernails. In a minute, she was a different woman.\r\n\r\n\"Wardrobe change,\" she said. \"Now you. Lose the shoes, lose the jacket,\r\nlose the hat.\" I could see her point. The cops would be looking very\r\ncarefully at anyone who looked like they'd been a part of the VampMob.\r\nI ditched the hat entirely -- I'd never liked ball caps. Then I jammed\r\nthe jacket into my pack and got out a long-sleeved tee with a picture\r\nof Rosa Luxembourg on it and pulled it over my black tee. I let Masha\r\nwipe my makeup off and clean my nails and a minute later, I was clean.\r\n\r\n\"Switch off your phone,\" she said. \"You carrying any arphids?\"\r\n\r\nI had my student card, my ATM card, my Fast Pass. They all went into a\r\nsilvered bag she held out, which I recognized as a radio-proof Faraday\r\npouch. But as she put them in her pocket, I realized I'd just turned my\r\nID over to her. If she was on the other side...\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of what had just happened began to sink in. In my mind,\r\nI'd pictured having Ange with me at this point. Ange would make it two\r\nagainst one. Ange would help me see if there was something amiss. If\r\nMasha wasn't all she said she was.\r\n\r\n\"Put these pebbles in your shoes before you put them on --\"\r\n\r\n\"It's OK. I sprained my foot. No gait recognition program will spot me\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded once, one pro to another, and slung her pack. I picked up\r\nmine and we moved. The total time for the changeover was less than a\r\nminute. We looked and walked like two different people.\r\n\r\nShe looked at her watch and shook her head. \"Come on,\" she said. \"We\r\nhave to make our rendezvous. Don't think of running, either. You've got\r\ntwo choices now. Me, or jail. They'll be analyzing the footage from\r\nthat mob for days, but once they're done, every face in it will go in a\r\ndatabase. Our departure will be noted. We are both wanted criminals\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\nShe got us off Market Street on the next block, swinging back into the\r\nTenderloin. I knew this neighborhood. This was where we'd gone hunting\r\nfor an open WiFi access-point back on the day, playing Harajuku Fun\r\nMadness.\r\n\r\n\"Where are we going?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"We're about to catch a ride,\" she said. \"Shut up and let me\r\nconcentrate.\"\r\n\r\nWe moved fast, and sweat streamed down my face from under my hair,\r\ncoursed down my back and slid down the crack of my ass and my thighs.\r\nMy foot was *really* hurting and I was seeing the streets of San\r\nFrancisco race by, maybe for the last time, ever.\r\n\r\nIt didn't help that we were ploughing straight uphill, moving for the\r\nzone where the seedy Tenderloin gives way to the nosebleed real-estate\r\nvalues of Nob Hill. My breath came in ragged gasps. She moved us mostly\r\nup narrow alleys, using the big streets just to get from one alley to\r\nthe next.\r\n\r\nWe were just stepping into one such alley, Sabin Place, when someone\r\nfell in behind us and said, \"Freeze right there.\" It was full of evil\r\nmirth. We stopped and turned around.\r\n\r\nAt the mouth of the alley stood Charles, wearing a halfhearted VampMob\r\noutfit of black t-shirt and jeans and white face-paint. \"Hello,\r\nMarcus,\" he said. \"You going somewhere?\" He smiled a huge, wet grin.\r\n\"Who's your girlfriend?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you want, Charles?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've been hanging out on that traitorous Xnet ever since I\r\nspotted you giving out DVDs at school. When I heard about your VampMob,\r\nI thought I'd go along and hang around the edges, just to see if you\r\nshowed up and what you did. You know what I saw?\"\r\n\r\nI said nothing. He had his phone in his hand, pointed at us. Recording.\r\nMaybe ready to dial 911. Beside me, Masha had gone still as a board.\r\n\r\n\"I saw you *leading* the damned thing. And I *recorded* it, Marcus. So\r\nnow I'm going to call the cops and we're going to wait right here for\r\nthem. And then you're going to go to pound-you-in-the-ass prison, for a\r\nlong, long time.\"\r\n\r\nMasha stepped forward.\r\n\r\n\"Stop right there, chickie,\" he said. \"I saw you get him away. I saw it\r\nall --\"\r\n\r\nShe took another step forward and snatched the phone out of his hand,\r\nreaching behind her with her other hand and bringing it out holding a\r\nwallet open.\r\n\r\n\"DHS, dick-head,\" she said. \"I'm DHS. I've been running this twerp back\r\nto his masters to see where he went. I *was* doing that. Now you've\r\nblown it. We have a name for that. We call it 'Obstruction of National\r\nSecurity.' You're about to hear that phrase a lot more often.\"\r\n\r\nCharles took a step backward, his hands held up in front of him. He'd\r\ngone even paler under his makeup. \"What? No! I mean -- I didn't know! I\r\nwas trying to *help*!\"\r\n\r\n\"The last thing we need is a bunch of high school Junior G-men\r\n'helping' buddy. You can tell it to the judge.\"\r\n\r\nHe moved back again, but Masha was fast. She grabbed his wrist and\r\ntwisted him into the same judo hold she'd had me in back at Civic\r\nCenter. Her hand dipped back to her pockets and came out holding a\r\nstrip of plastic, a handcuff strip, which she quickly wound around his\r\nwrists.\r\n\r\nThat was the last thing I saw as I took off running.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI made it as far as the other end of the alley before she caught up\r\nwith me, tackling me from behind and sending me sprawling. I couldn't\r\nmove very fast, not with my hurt foot and the weight of my pack. I went\r\ndown in a hard face-plant and skidded, grinding my cheek into the grimy\r\nasphalt.\r\n\r\n\"Jesus,\" she said. \"You're a goddamned idiot. You didn't *believe*\r\nthat, did you?\"\r\n\r\nMy heart thudded in my chest. She was on top of me and slowly she let\r\nme up.\r\n\r\n\"Do I need to cuff you, Marcus?\"\r\n\r\nI got to my feet. I hurt all over. I wanted to die.\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" she said. \"It's not far now.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'It' turned out to be a moving van on a Nob Hill side-street, a\r\nsixteen-wheeler the size of one of the ubiquitous DHS trucks that still\r\nturned up on San Francisco's street corners, bristling with antennas.\r\n\r\nThis one, though, said \"Three Guys and a Truck Moving\" on the side, and\r\nthe three guys were very much in evidence, trekking in and out of a\r\ntall apartment building with a green awning. They were carrying crated\r\nfurniture, neatly labeled boxes, loading them one at a time onto the\r\ntruck and carefully packing them there.\r\n\r\nShe walked us around the block once, apparently unsatisfied with\r\nsomething, then, on the next pass, she made eye-contact with the man\r\nwho was watching the van, an older black guy with a kidney-belt and\r\nheavy gloves. He had a kind face and he smiled at us as she led us\r\nquickly, casually up the truck's three stairs and into its depth.\r\n\"Under the big table,\" he said. \"We left you some space there.\"\r\n\r\nThe truck was more than half full, but there was a narrow corridor\r\naround a huge table with a quilted blanket thrown over it and\r\nbubble-wrap wound around its legs.\r\n\r\nMasha pulled me under the table. It was stuffy and still and dusty\r\nunder there, and I suppressed a sneeze as we scrunched in among the\r\nboxes. The space was so tight that we were on top of each other. I\r\ndidn't think that Ange would have fit in there.\r\n\r\n\"Bitch,\" I said, looking at Masha.\r\n\r\n\"Shut up. You should be licking my boots thanking me. You would have\r\nended up in jail in a week, two tops. Not Gitmo-by-the-Bay. Syria,\r\nmaybe. I think that's where they sent the ones they really wanted to\r\ndisappear.\"\r\n\r\nI put my head on my knees and tried to breathe deeply.\r\n\r\n\"Why would you do something so stupid as declaring war on the DHS\r\nanyway?\"\r\n\r\nI told her. I told her about being busted and I told her about Darryl.\r\n\r\nShe patted her pockets and came up with a phone. It was Charles's.\r\n\"Wrong phone.\" She came up with another phone. She turned it on and the\r\nglow from its screen filled our little fort. After fiddling for a\r\nsecond, she showed it to me.\r\n\r\nIt was the picture she'd snapped of us, just before the bombs blew. It\r\nwas the picture of Jolu and Van and me and --\r\n\r\nDarryl.\r\n\r\nI was holding in my hand proof that Darryl had been with us minutes\r\nbefore we'd all gone into DHS custody. Proof that he'd been alive and\r\nwell and in our company.\r\n\r\n\"You need to give me a copy of this,\" I said. \"I need it.\"\r\n\r\n\"When we get to LA,\" she said, snatching the phone back. \"Once you've\r\nbeen briefed on how to be a fugitive without getting both our asses\r\ncaught and shipped to Syria. I don't want you getting rescue ideas\r\nabout this guy. He's safe enough where he is -- for now.\"\r\n\r\nI thought about trying to take it from her by force, but she'd already\r\ndemonstrated her physical skill. She must have been a black-belt or\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nWe sat there in the dark, listening to the three guys load the truck\r\nwith box after box, tying things down, grunting with the effort of it.\r\nI tried to sleep, but couldn't. Masha had no such problem. She snored.\r\n\r\nThere was still light shining through the narrow, obstructed corridor\r\nthat led to the fresh air outside. I stared at it, through the gloom,\r\nand thought of Ange.\r\n\r\nMy Ange. Her hair brushing her shoulders as she turned her head from\r\nside to side, laughing at something I'd done. Her face when I'd seen\r\nher last, falling down in the crowd at VampMob. All those people at\r\nVampMob, like the people in the park, down and writhing, the DHS moving\r\nin with truncheons. The ones who disappeared.\r\n\r\nDarryl. Stuck on Treasure Island, his side stitched up, taken out of\r\nhis cell for endless rounds of questioning about the terrorists.\r\n\r\nDarryl's father, ruined and boozy, unshaven. Washed up and in his\r\nuniform, \"for the photos.\" Weeping like a little boy.\r\n\r\nMy own father, and the way that he had been changed by my disappearance\r\nto Treasure Island. He'd been just as broken as Darryl's father, but in\r\nhis own way. And his face, when I told him where I'd been.\r\n\r\nThat was when I knew that I couldn't run.\r\n\r\nThat was when I knew that I had to stay and fight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMasha's breathing was deep and regular, but when I reached with glacial\r\nslowness into her pocket for her phone, she snuffled a little and\r\nshifted. I froze and didn't even breathe for a full two minutes,\r\ncounting one hippopotami, two hippopotami.\r\n\r\nSlowly, her breath deepened again. I tugged the phone free of her\r\njacket-pocket one  millimeter at a time, my fingers and arm trembling\r\nwith the effort of moving so slowly.\r\n\r\nThen I had it, a little candy-bar shaped thing.\r\n\r\nI turned to head for the light, when I had a flash of memory: Charles,\r\nholding out his phone, waggling it at us, taunting us. It had been a\r\ncandy-bar-shaped phone, silver, plastered in the logos of a dozen\r\ncompanies that had subsidized the cost of the handset through the phone\r\ncompany. It was the kind of phone where you had to listen to a\r\ncommercial every time you made a call.\r\n\r\nIt was too dim to see the phone clearly in the truck, but I could feel\r\nit. Were those company decals on its sides? Yes? Yes. I had just stolen\r\n*Charles's* phone from Masha.\r\n\r\nI turned back around slowly, slowly, and slowly, slowly, *slowly*, I\r\nreached back into her pocket. *Her* phone was bigger and bulkier, with\r\na better camera and who knew what else?\r\n\r\nI'd been through this once before -- that made it a little easier.\r\nMillimeter by millimeter again, I teased it free of her pocket,\r\nstopping twice when she snuffled and twitched.\r\n\r\nI had the phone free of her pocket and I was beginning to back away\r\nwhen her hand shot out, fast as a snake, and grabbed my wrist, hard,\r\nfingertips grinding away at the small, tender bones below my hand.\r\n\r\nI gasped and stared into Masha's wide-open, staring eyes.\r\n\r\n\"You are such an idiot,\" she said, conversationally, taking the phone\r\nfrom me, punching at its keypad with her other hand. \"How did you plan\r\non unlocking this again?\"\r\n\r\nI swallowed. I felt bones grind against each other in my wrist. I bit\r\nmy lip to keep from crying out.\r\n\r\nShe continued to punch away with her other hand. \"Is this what you\r\nthought you'd get away with?\" She showed me the picture of all of us,\r\nDarryl and Jolu, Van and me. \"This picture?\"\r\n\r\nI didn't say anything. My wrist felt like it would shatter.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe I should just delete it, take temptation out of your way.\" Her\r\nfree hand moved some more. Her phone asked her if she was sure and she\r\nhad to look at it to find the right button.\r\n\r\nThat's when I moved. I had Charles's phone in my other hand still, and\r\nI brought it down on her crushing hand as hard as I could, banging my\r\nknuckles on the table overhead. I hit her hand so hard the phone\r\nshattered and she yelped and her hand went slack. I was still moving,\r\nreaching for her other hand, for her now-unlocked phone with her thumb\r\nstill poised over the OK key. Her fingers spasmed on the empty air as I\r\nsnatched the phone out of her hand.\r\n\r\nI moved down the narrow corridor on hands and knees, heading for the\r\nlight. I felt her hands slap at my feet and ankles twice, and I had to\r\nshove aside some of the boxes that had walled us in like a Pharaoh in a\r\ntomb. A few of them fell down behind me, and I heard Masha grunt again.\r\n\r\nThe rolling truck door was open a crack and I dove for it, slithering\r\nout under it. The steps had been removed and I found myself hanging\r\nover the road, sliding headfirst into it, clanging my head off the\r\nblacktop with a thump that rang my ears like a gong. I scrambled to my\r\nfeet, holding the bumper, and desperately dragged down on the\r\ndoor-handle, slamming it shut. Masha screamed inside -- I must have\r\ncaught her fingertips. I felt like throwing up, but I didn't.\r\n\r\nI padlocked the truck instead.\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nChapter 20\r\n\r\n[[This chapter is dedicated to The Tattered Cover, Denver's legendary\r\nindependent bookstore. I happened upon The Tattered Cover quite by\r\naccident: Alice and I had just landed in Denver, coming in from London,\r\nand it was early and cold and we needed coffee. We drove in aimless\r\nrental-car circles, and that's when I spotted it, the Tattered Cover's\r\nsign. Something about it tingled in my hindbrain -- I knew I'd heard of\r\nthis place. We pulled in (got a coffee) and stepped into the store -- a\r\nwonderland of dark wood, homey reading nooks, and miles and miles of\r\nbookshelves.]]\r\n\r\n[[The Tattered Cover\r\nhttp://www.tatteredcover.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=\r\n9780765319852 1628 16th St., Denver, CO USA 80202 +1 303 436 1070]]\r\n\r\nNone of the three guys were around at the moment, so I took off. My\r\nhead hurt so much I thought I must be bleeding, but my hands came away\r\ndry. My twisted ankle had frozen up in the truck so that I ran like a\r\nbroken marionette, and I stopped only once, to cancel the\r\nphoto-deletion on Masha's phone. I turned off its radio -- both to save\r\nbattery and to keep it from being used to track me -- and set the sleep\r\ntimer to two hours, the longest setting available. I tried to set it to\r\nnot require a password to wake from sleep, but that required a password\r\nitself. I was just going to have to tap the keypad at least once every\r\ntwo hours until I could figure out how to get the photo off of the\r\nphone. I would need a charger, then.\r\n\r\nI didn't have a plan. I needed one. I needed to sit down, to get online\r\n-- to figure out what I was going to do next. I was sick of letting\r\nother people do my planning for me. I didn't want to be acting because\r\nof what Masha did, or because of the DHS, or because of my dad. Or\r\nbecause of Ange? Well, maybe I'd act because of Ange. That would be\r\njust fine, in fact.\r\n\r\nI'd just been slipping downhill, taking alleys when I could, merging\r\nwith the Tenderloin crowds. I didn't have any destination in mind.\r\nEvery few minutes, I put my hand in my pocket and nudged one of the\r\nkeys on Masha's phone to keep it from going asleep. It made an awkward\r\nbulge, unfolded there in my jacket.\r\n\r\nI stopped and leaned against a building. My ankle was killing me. Where\r\nwas I, anyway?\r\n\r\nO'Farrell, at Hyde Street. In front of a dodgy \"Asian Massage Parlor.\"\r\nMy traitorous feet had taken me right back to the beginning -- taken me\r\nback to where the photo on Masha's phone had been taken, seconds before\r\nthe Bay Bridge blew, before my life changed forever.\r\n\r\nI wanted to sit down on the sidewalk and bawl, but that wouldn't solve\r\nmy problems. I had to call Barbara Stratford, tell her what had\r\nhappened. Show her the photo of Darryl.\r\n\r\nWhat was I thinking? I had to show her the video, the one that Masha\r\nhad sent me -- the one where the President's Chief of Staff gloated at\r\nthe attacks on San Francisco and admitted that he knew when and where\r\nthe next attacks would happen and that he wouldn't stop them because\r\nthey'd help his man get re-elected.\r\n\r\nThat was a plan, then: get in touch with Barbara, give her the\r\ndocuments, and get them into print. The VampMob had to have really\r\nfreaked people out, made them think that we really were a bunch of\r\nterrorists. Of course, when I'd been planning it, I had been thinking\r\nof how good a distraction it would be, not how it would look to some\r\nNASCAR Dad in Nebraska.\r\n\r\nI'd call Barbara, and I'd do it smart, from a payphone, putting my hood\r\nup so that the inevitable CCTV wouldn't get a photo of me. I dug a\r\nquarter out of my pocket and polished it on my shirt-tail, getting the\r\nfingerprints off it.\r\n\r\nI headed downhill, down and down to the BART station and the payphones\r\nthere. I made it to the trolley-car stop when I spotted the cover of\r\nthe week's *Bay Guardian*, stacked in a high pile next to a homeless\r\nblack guy who smiled at me. \"Go ahead and read the cover, it's free --\r\nit'll cost you fifty cents to look inside, though.\"\r\n\r\nThe headline was set in the biggest type I'd seen since 9/11:\r\n\r\nINSIDE GITMO-BY-THE-BAY\r\n\r\nBeneath it, in slightly smaller type:\r\n\r\n\"How the DHS has kept our children and friends in secret prisons on our\r\ndoorstep.\r\n\r\n\"By Barbara Stratford, Special to the Bay Guardian\"\r\n\r\nThe newspaper seller shook his head. \"Can you believe that?\" he said.\r\n\"Right here in San Francisco. Man, the government *sucks*.\"\r\n\r\nTheoretically, the *Guardian* was free, but this guy appeared to have\r\ncornered the local market for copies of it. I had a quarter in my hand.\r\nI dropped it into his cup and fished for another one. I didn't bother\r\npolishing the fingerprints off of it this time.\r\n\r\n\"We're told that the world changed forever when the Bay Bridge was\r\nblown up by parties unknown. Thousands of our friends and neighbors\r\ndied on that day. Almost none of them have been recovered; their\r\nremains are presumed to be resting in the city's harbor.\r\n\r\n\"But an extraordinary story told to this reporter by a young man who\r\nwas arrested by the DHS minutes after the explosion suggests that our\r\nown government has illegally held many of those thought dead on\r\nTreasure Island, which had been evacuated and declared off-limits to\r\ncivilians shortly after the bombing...\"\r\n\r\nI sat down on a bench -- the same bench, I noted with a prickly\r\nhair-up-the-neck feeling, where we'd rested Darryl after escaping from\r\nthe BART station -- and read the article all the way through. It took a\r\nhuge effort not to burst into tears right there. Barbara had found some\r\nphotos of me and Darryl goofing around together and they ran alongside\r\nthe text. The photos were maybe a year old, but I looked so much\r\n*younger* in them, like I was 10 or 11. I'd done a lot of growing up in\r\nthe past couple months.\r\n\r\nThe piece was beautifully written. I kept feeling outraged on behalf of\r\nthe poor kids she was writing about, then remembering that she was\r\nwriting about *me*. Zeb's note was there, his crabbed handwriting\r\nreproduced in large, a half-sheet of the newspaper. Barbara had dug up\r\nmore info on other kids who were missing and presumed dead, a long\r\nlist, and asked how many had been stuck there on the island, just a few\r\nmiles from their parents' doorsteps.\r\n\r\nI dug another quarter out of my pocket, then changed my mind. What was\r\nthe chance that Barbara's phone wasn't tapped? There was no way I was\r\ngoing to be able to call her now, not directly. I needed some\r\nintermediary to get in touch with her and get her to meet me somewhere\r\nsouth. So much for plans.\r\n\r\nWhat I really, really needed was the Xnet.\r\n\r\nHow the hell was I going to get online? My phone's wifinder was\r\nblinking like crazy -- there was wireless all around me, but I didn't\r\nhave an Xbox and a TV and a ParanoidXbox DVD to boot from. WiFi, WiFi\r\neverywhere...\r\n\r\nThat's when I spotted them. Two kids, about my age, moving among the\r\ncrowd at the top of the stairs down into the BART.\r\n\r\nWhat caught my eye was the way they were moving, kind of clumsy,\r\nnudging up against the commuters and the tourists. Each had a hand in\r\nhis pocket, and whenever they met one another's eye, they snickered.\r\nThey couldn't have been more obvious jammers, but the crowd was\r\noblivious to them. Being down in that neighborhood, you expect to be\r\ndodging homeless people and crazies, so you don't make eye contact,\r\ndon't look around at all if you can help it.\r\n\r\nI sidled up to one. He seemed really young, but he couldn't have been\r\nany younger than me.\r\n\r\n\"Hey,\" I said. \"Hey, can you guys come over here for a second?\"\r\n\r\nHe pretended not to hear me. He looked right through me, the way you\r\nwould a homeless person.\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" I said. \"I don't have a lot of time.\" I grabbed his shoulder\r\nand hissed in his ear. \"The cops are after me. I'm from Xnet.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked scared now, like he wanted to run away, and his friend was\r\nmoving toward us. \"I'm serious,\" I said. \"Just hear me out.\"\r\n\r\nHis friend came over. He was taller, and beefy -- like Darryl. \"Hey,\"\r\nhe said. \"Something wrong?\"\r\n\r\nHis friend whispered in his ear. The two of them looked like they were\r\ngoing to bolt.\r\n\r\nI grabbed my copy of the *Bay Guardian* from under my arm and rattled\r\nit in front of them. \"Just turn to page 5, OK?\"\r\n\r\nThey did. They looked at the headline. The photo. Me.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dude,\" the first one said. \"We are *so* not worthy.\" He grinned at\r\nme like crazy, and the beefier one slapped me on the back.\r\n\r\n\"No *way* --\" he said. \"You're M --\"\r\n\r\nI put a hand over his mouth. \"Come over here, OK?\"\r\n\r\nI brought them back to my bench. I noticed that there was something old\r\nand brown staining the sidewalk underneath it. Darryl's blood? It made\r\nmy skin pucker up. We sat down.\r\n\r\n\"I'm Marcus,\" I said, swallowing hard as I gave my real name to these\r\ntwo who already knew me as M1k3y. I was blowing my cover, but the *Bay\r\nGuardian* had already made the connection for me.\r\n\r\n\"Nate,\" the small one said. \"Liam,\" the bigger one said. \"Dude, it is\r\n*such* an honor to meet you. You're like our all-time hero --\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't say that,\" I said. \"Don't say that. You two are like a flashing\r\nadvertisement that says, 'I am jamming, please put my ass in\r\nGitmo-by-the-Bay. You couldn't be more obvious.\"\r\n\r\nLiam looked like he might cry.\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry, you didn't get busted. I'll give you some tips, later.\"\r\nHe brightened up again. What was becoming weirdly clear was that these\r\ntwo really *did* idolize M1k3y, and that they'd do anything I said.\r\nThey were grinning like idiots. It made me uncomfortable, sick to my\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, I need to get on Xnet, now, without going home or anywhere\r\nnear home. Do you two live near here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" Nate said. \"Up at the top of California Street. It's a bit of a\r\nwalk -- steep hills.\" I'd just walked all the way down them. Masha was\r\nsomewhere up there. But still, it was better than I had any right to\r\nexpect.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNate loaned me his baseball hat and traded jackets with me. I didn't\r\nhave to worry about gait-recognition, not with my ankle throbbing the\r\nway it was -- I limped like an extra in a cowboy movie.\r\n\r\nNate lived in a huge four-bedroom apartment at the top of Nob Hill. The\r\nbuilding had a doorman, in a red overcoat with gold brocade, and he\r\ntouched his cap and called Nate, \"Mr Nate\" and welcomed us all there.\r\nThe place was spotless and smelled of furniture polish. I tried not to\r\ngawp at what must have been a couple million bucks' worth of condo.\r\n\r\n\"My dad,\" he explained. \"He was an investment banker. Lots of life\r\ninsurance. He died when I was 14 and we got it all. They'd been\r\ndivorced for years, but he left my mom as beneficiary.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the floor-to-ceiling window, you could see a stunning view of the\r\nother side of Nob Hill, all the way down to Fisherman's Wharf, to the\r\nugly stub of the Bay Bridge, the crowd of cranes and trucks. Through\r\nthe mist, I could just make out Treasure Island. Looking down all that\r\nway, it gave me a crazy urge to jump.\r\n\r\nI got online with his Xbox and a huge plasma screen in the living room.\r\nHe showed me how many open WiFi networks were visible from his high\r\nvantage point -- twenty, thirty of them. This was a good spot to be an\r\nXnetter.\r\n\r\nThere was a *lot* of email in my M1k3y account. 20,000 new messages\r\nsince Ange and I had left her place that morning. Lots of it was from\r\nthe press, asking for followup interviews, but most of it was from the\r\nXnetters, people who'd seen the *Guardian* story and wanted to tell me\r\nthat they'd do anything to help me, anything I needed.\r\n\r\nThat did it. Tears started to roll down my cheeks.\r\n\r\nNate and Liam exchanged glances. I tried to stop, but it was no good. I\r\nwas sobbing now. Nate went to an oak book-case on one wall and swung a\r\nbar out of one of its shelves, revealing gleaming rows of bottles. He\r\npoured me a shot of something golden brown and brought it to me.\r\n\r\n\"Rare Irish whiskey,\" he said. \"Mom's favorite.\"\r\n\r\nIt tasted like fire, like gold. I sipped at it, trying not to choke. I\r\ndidn't really like hard liquor, but this was different. I took several\r\ndeep breaths.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Nate,\" I said. He looked like I'd just pinned a medal on him.\r\nHe was a good kid.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" I said, and picked up the keyboard. The two boys watched\r\nin fascination as I paged through my mail on the gigantic screen.\r\n\r\nWhat I was looking for, first and foremost, was email from Ange. There\r\nwas a chance that she'd just gotten away. There was always that chance.\r\n\r\nI was an idiot to even hope. There was nothing from her. I started\r\ngoing through the mail as fast as I could, picking apart the press\r\nrequests, the fan mail, the hate mail, the spam...\r\n\r\nAnd that's when I found it: a letter from Zeb.\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't nice to wake up this morning and find the letter that I\r\nthought you would destroy in the pages of the newspaper. Not nice at\r\nall. Made me feel -- hunted.\r\n\r\n\"But I've come to understand why you did it. I don't know if I can\r\napprove of your tactics, but it's easy to see that your motives were\r\nsound.\r\n\r\n\"If you're reading this, that means that there's a good chance you've\r\ngone underground. It's not easy. I've been learning that. I've been\r\nlearning a lot more.\r\n\r\n\"I can help you. I should do that for you. You're doing what you can\r\nfor me. (Even if you're not doing it with my permission.)\r\n\r\n\"Reply if you get this, if you're on the run and alone. Or reply if\r\nyou're in custody, being run by our friends on Gitmo, looking for a way\r\nto make the pain stop. If they've got you, you'll do what they tell\r\nyou. I know that. I'll take that risk.\r\n\r\n\"For you, M1k3y.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wooooah,\" Liam breathed. \"Duuuuude.\" I wanted to smack him. I turned\r\nto say something awful and cutting to him, but he was staring at me\r\nwith eyes as big as saucers, looking like he wanted to drop to his\r\nknees and worship me.\r\n\r\n\"Can I just say,\" Nate said, \"can I just say that it is the biggest\r\nhonor of my entire life to help you? Can I just say that?\"\r\n\r\nI was blushing now. There was nothing for it. These two were totally\r\nstar-struck, even though I wasn't any kind of star, not in my own mind\r\nat least.\r\n\r\n\"Can you guys --\" I swallowed. \"Can I have some privacy here?\"\r\n\r\nThey slunk out of the room like bad puppies and I felt like a tool. I\r\ntyped fast.\r\n\r\n\"I got away, Zeb. And I'm on the run. I need all the help I can get. I\r\nwant to end this now.\" I remembered to take Masha's phone out of my\r\npocket and tickle it to keep it from going to sleep.\r\n\r\nThey let me use the shower, gave me a change of clothes, a new backpack\r\nwith half their earthquake kit in it -- energy bars, medicine, hot and\r\ncold packs, and an old sleeping-bag. They even slipped a spare Xbox\r\nUniversal already loaded with ParanoidXbox on it into there. That was a\r\nnice touch. I had to draw the line at a flaregun.\r\n\r\nI kept on checking my email to see if Zeb had replied. I answered the\r\nfan mail. I answered the mail from the press. I deleted the hate mail.\r\nI was half-expecting to see something from Masha, but chances were she\r\nwas halfway to LA by now, her fingers hurt, and in no position to type.\r\nI tickled her phone again.\r\n\r\nThey encouraged me to take a nap and for a brief, shameful moment, I\r\ngot all paranoid like maybe these guys were thinking of turning me in\r\nonce I was asleep. Which was idiotic -- they could have turned me in\r\njust as easily when I was awake. I just couldn't compute the fact that\r\nthey thought *so much* of me. I had known, intellectually, that there\r\nwere people who would follow M1k3y. I'd met some of those people that\r\nmorning, shouting BITE BITE BITE and vamping it up at Civic Center. But\r\nthese two were more personal. They were just nice, goofy guys, they\r\ncoulda been any of my friends back in the days before the Xnet, just\r\ntwo pals who palled around having teenage adventures. They'd\r\nvolunteered to join an army, my army. I had a responsibility to them.\r\nLeft to themselves, they'd get caught, it was only a matter of time.\r\nThey were too trusting.\r\n\r\n\"Guys, listen to me for a second. I have something serious I need to\r\ntalk to you about.\"\r\n\r\nThey almost stood at attention. It would have been funny if it wasn't\r\nso scary.\r\n\r\n\"Here's the thing. Now that you've helped me, it's really dangerous. If\r\nyou get caught, I'll get caught. They'll get anything you know out of\r\nyou --\" I held up my hand to forestall their protests. \"No, stop. You\r\nhaven't been through it. Everyone talks. Everyone breaks. If you're\r\never caught, you tell them everything, right away, as fast as you can,\r\nas much as you can. They'll get it all eventually anyway. That's how\r\nthey work.\r\n\r\n\"But you won't get caught, and here's why: you're not jammers anymore.\r\nYou are retired from active duty. You're a --\" I fished in my memory\r\nfor vocabulary words culled from spy thrillers -- \"you're a sleeper\r\ncell. Stand down. Go back to being normal kids. One way or another, I'm\r\ngoing to break this thing, break it wide open, end it. Or it will get\r\nme, finally, do me in. If you don't hear from me within 72 hours,\r\nassume that they got me. Do whatever you want then. But for the next\r\nthree days -- and forever, if I do what I'm trying to do -- stand down.\r\nWill you promise me that?\"\r\n\r\nThey promised with all solemnity. I let them talk me into napping, but\r\nmade them swear to rouse me once an hour. I'd have to tickle Masha's\r\nphone and I wanted to know as soon as Zeb got back in touch with me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rendezvous was on a BART car, which made me nervous. They're full\r\nof cameras. But Zeb knew what he was doing. He had me meet him in the\r\nlast car of a certain train departing from Powell Street Station, at a\r\ntime when that car was filled with the press of bodies. He sidled up to\r\nme in the crowd, and the good commuters of San Francisco cleared a\r\nspace for him, the hollow that always surrounds homeless people.\r\n\r\n\"Nice to see you again,\" he muttered, facing into the doorway. Looking\r\ninto the dark glass, I could see that there was no one close enough to\r\neavesdrop -- not without some kind of high-efficiency mic rig, and if\r\nthey knew enough to show up here with one of those, we were dead\r\nanyway.\r\n\r\n\"You too, brother,\" I said. \"I'm -- I'm sorry, you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up. Don't be sorry. You were braver than I am. Are you ready to\r\ngo underground now? Ready to disappear?\"\r\n\r\n\"About that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's not the plan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, OK? I have -- I have pictures, video. Stuff that really\r\n*proves* something.\" I reached into my pocket and tickled Masha's\r\nphone. I'd bought a charger for it in Union Square on the way down, and\r\nhad stopped and plugged it in at a cafe for long enough to get the\r\nbattery up to four out of five bars. \"I need to get it to Barbara\r\nStratford, the woman from the *Guardian*. But they're going to be\r\nwatching her -- watching to see if I show up.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't think that they'll be watching for me, too? If your plan\r\ninvolves me going within a mile of that woman's home or office --\"\r\n\r\n\"I want you to get Van to come and meet me. Did Darryl ever tell you\r\nabout Van? The girl --\"\r\n\r\n\"He told me. Yes, he told me. You don't think they'll be watching her?\r\nAll of you who were arrested?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think they will. I don't think they'll be watching her as hard. And\r\nVan has totally clean hands. She never cooperated with any of my --\" I\r\nswallowed. \"With my projects. So they might be a little more relaxed\r\nabout her. If she calls the Bay Guardian to make an appointment to\r\nexplain why I'm just full of crap, maybe they'll let her keep it.\"\r\n\r\nHe stared at the door for a long time.\r\n\r\n\"You know what happens when they catch us again.\" It wasn't a question.\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure? Some of the people that were on Treasure Island with us\r\ngot taken away in helicopters. They got taken *offshore*. There are\r\ncountries where America can outsource its torture. Countries where you\r\nwill rot forever. Countries where you wish they would just get it over\r\nwith, have you dig a trench and then shoot you in the back of the head\r\nas you stand over it.\"\r\n\r\nI swallowed and nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Is it worth the risk? We can go underground for a long, long time\r\nhere. Someday we might get our country back. We can wait it out.\"\r\n\r\nI shook my head. \"You can't get anything done by doing nothing. It's\r\nour *country*. They've taken it from us. The terrorists who attack us\r\nare still free -- but *we're not*. I can't go underground for a year,\r\nten years, my whole life, waiting for freedom to be handed to me.\r\nFreedom is something you have to take for yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, Van left school as usual, sitting in the back of the\r\nbus with a tight knot of her friends, laughing and joking the way she\r\nalways did. The other riders on the bus took special note of her, she\r\nwas so loud, and besides, she was wearing that stupid, giant floppy\r\nhat, something that looked like a piece out of a school play about\r\nRenaissance sword fighters. At one point they all huddled together,\r\nthen turned away to look out the back of the bus, pointing and\r\ngiggling. The girl who wore the hat now was the same height as Van, and\r\nfrom behind, it could be her.\r\n\r\nNo one paid any attention to the mousy little Asian girl who got off a\r\nfew stops before the BART. She was dressed in a plain old school\r\nuniform, and looking down shyly as she stepped off. Besides, at that\r\nmoment, the loud Korean girl let out a whoop and her friends followed\r\nalong, laughing so loudly that even the bus driver slowed down, twisted\r\nin his seat and gave them a dirty look.\r\n\r\nVan hurried away down the street with her head down, her hair tied back\r\nand dropped down the collar of her out-of-style bubble jacket. She had\r\nslipped lifts into her shoes that made her two wobbly, awkward inches\r\ntaller, and had taken her contacts out and put on her least-favored\r\nglasses, with huge lenses that took up half her face. Although I'd been\r\nwaiting in the bus-shelter for her and knew when to expect her, I\r\nhardly recognized her. I got up and walked along behind her, across the\r\nstreet, trailing by half a block.\r\n\r\nThe people who passed me looked away as quickly as possible. I looked\r\nlike a homeless kid, with a grubby cardboard sign, street-grimy\r\novercoat, huge, overstuffed knapsack with duct-tape over its rips. No\r\none wants to look at a street-kid, because if you meet his eye, he\r\nmight ask you for some spare change. I'd walked around Oakland all\r\nafternoon and the only person who'd spoken to me was a Jehovah's\r\nWitness and a Scientologist, both trying to convert me. It felt gross,\r\nlike being hit on by a pervert.\r\n\r\nVan followed the directions I'd written down carefully. Zeb had passed\r\nthem to her the same way he'd given me the note outside school --\r\nbumping into her as she waited for the bus, apologizing profusely. I'd\r\nwritten the note plainly and simply, just laying it out for her: I know\r\nyou don't approve. I understand. But this is it, this is the most\r\nimportant favor I've ever asked of you. Please. Please.\r\n\r\nShe'd come. I knew she would. We had a lot of history, Van and I. She\r\ndidn't like what had happened to the world, either. Besides, an evil,\r\nchuckling voice in my head had pointed out, she was under suspicion now\r\nthat Barbara's article was out.\r\n\r\nWe walked like that for six or seven blocks, looking at who was near\r\nus, what cars went past. Zeb told me about five-person trails, where\r\nfive different undercovers traded off duties following you, making it\r\nnearly impossible to spot them. You had to go somewhere totally\r\ndesolate, where anyone at all would stand out like a sore thumb.\r\n\r\nThe overpass for the 880 was just a few blocks from the Coliseum BART\r\nstation, and even with all the circling Van did, it didn't take long to\r\nreach it. The noise from overhead was nearly deafening. No one else was\r\naround, not that I could tell. I'd visited the site before I suggested\r\nit to Van in the note, taking care to check for places where someone\r\ncould hide. There weren't any.\r\n\r\nOnce she stopped at the appointed place, I moved quickly to catch up to\r\nher. She blinked owlishly at me from behind her glasses.\r\n\r\n\"Marcus,\" she breathed, and tears swam in her eyes. I found that I was\r\ncrying too. I'd make a really rotten fugitive. Too sentimental.\r\n\r\nShe hugged me so hard I couldn't breathe. I hugged her back even\r\nharder.\r\n\r\nThen she kissed me.\r\n\r\nNot on the cheek, not like a sister. Full on the lips, a hot, wet,\r\nsteamy kiss that seemed to go on forever. I was so overcome with\r\nemotion --\r\n\r\nNo, that's bull. I knew exactly what I was doing. I kissed her back.\r\n\r\nThen I stopped and pulled away, nearly shoved her away. \"Van,\" I\r\ngasped.\r\n\r\n\"Oops,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Van,\" I said again.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry,\" she said. \"I --\"\r\n\r\nSomething occurred to me just then, something I guess I should have\r\nseen a long, long time before.\r\n\r\n\"You *like* me, don't you?\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded miserably. \"For years,\" she said.\r\n\r\nOh, God. Darryl, all these years, so in love with her, and the whole\r\ntime she was looking at me, secretly wanting me. And then I ended up\r\nwith Ange. Ange said that she'd always fought with Van. And I was\r\nrunning around, getting into so much trouble.\r\n\r\n\"Van,\" I said. \"Van, I'm so sorry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forget it,\" she said, looking away. \"I know it can't be. I just wanted\r\nto do that once, just in case I never --\" She bit down on the words.\r\n\r\n\"Van, I need you to do something for me. Something important. I need\r\nyou to meet with the journalist from the Bay Guardian, Barbara\r\nStratford, the one who wrote the article. I need you to give her\r\nsomething.\" I explained about Masha's phone, told her about the video\r\nthat Masha had sent me.\r\n\r\n\"What good will this do, Marcus? What's the point?\"\r\n\r\n\"Van, you were right, at least partly. We can't fix the world by\r\nputting other people at risk. I need to solve the problem by telling\r\nwhat I know. I should have done that from the start. Should have walked\r\nstraight out of their custody and to Darryl's father's house and told\r\nhim what I knew. Now, though, I have evidence. This stuff -- it could\r\nchange the world. This is my last hope. The only hope for getting\r\nDarryl out, for getting a life that I don't spend underground, hiding\r\nfrom the cops. And you're the only person I can trust to do this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why me?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're kidding, right? Look at how well you handled getting here.\r\nYou're a pro. You're the best at this of any of us. You're the only one\r\nI can trust. That's why you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not your friend Angie?\" She said the name without any inflection\r\nat all, like it was a block of cement.\r\n\r\nI looked down. \"I thought you knew. They arrested her. She's in Gitmo\r\n-- on Treasure Island. She's been there for days now.\" I had been\r\ntrying not to think about this, not to think about what might be\r\nhappening to her. Now I couldn't stop myself and I started to sob. I\r\nfelt a pain in my stomach, like I'd been kicked, and I pushed my hands\r\ninto my middle to hold myself in. I folded there, and the next thing I\r\nknew, I was on my side in the rubble under the freeway, holding myself\r\nand crying.\r\n\r\nVan knelt down by my side. \"Give me the phone,\" she said, her voice an\r\nangry hiss. I fished it out of my pocket and passed it to her.\r\n\r\nEmbarrassed, I stopped crying and sat up. I knew that snot was running\r\ndown my face. Van was giving me a look of pure revulsion. \"You need to\r\nkeep it from going to sleep,\" I said. \"I have a charger here.\" I\r\nrummaged in my pack. I hadn't slept all the way through the night since\r\nI acquired it. I set the phone's alarm to go off every 90 minutes and\r\nwake me up so that I could keep it from going to sleep. \"Don't fold it\r\nshut, either.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the video?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's harder,\" I said. \"I emailed a copy to myself, but I can't get\r\nonto the Xnet anymore.\" In a pinch, I could have gone back to Nate and\r\nLiam and used their Xbox again, but I didn't want to risk it. \"Look,\r\nI'm going to give you my login and password for the Pirate Party's\r\nmail-server. You'll have to use Tor to access it -- Homeland Security\r\nis bound to be scanning for people logging into p-party mail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your login and password,\" she said, looking a little surprised.\r\n\r\n\"I trust you, Van. I know I can trust you.\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \"You *never* give out your passwords, Marcus.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think it matters anymore. Either you succeed or I -- or it's\r\nthe end of Marcus Yallow. Maybe I'll get a new identity, but I don't\r\nthink so. I think they'll catch me. I guess I've known all along that\r\nthey'd catch me, some day.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at me, furious now. \"What a waste. What was it all for,\r\nanyway?\"\r\n\r\nOf all the things she could have said, nothing could have hurt me more.\r\nIt was like another kick in the stomach. What a waste, all of it,\r\nfutile. Darryl and Ange, gone. I might never see my family again. And\r\nstill, Homeland Security had my city and my country caught in a\r\nmassive, irrational shrieking freak-out where anything could be done in\r\nthe name of stopping terrorism.\r\n\r\nVan looked like she was waiting for me to say something, but I had\r\nnothing to say to that. She left me there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZeb had a pizza for me when I got back \"home\" -- to the tent under a\r\nfreeway overpass in the Mission that he'd staked out for the night. He\r\nhad a pup tent, military surplus, stenciled with SAN FRANCISCO LOCAL\r\nHOMELESS COORDINATING BOARD.\r\n\r\nThe pizza was a Dominos, cold and clabbered, but delicious for all\r\nthat. \"You like pineapple on your pizza?\"\r\n\r\nZeb smiled condescendingly at me. \"Freegans can't be choosy,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Freegans?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like vegans, but we only eat free food.\"\r\n\r\n\"Free food?\"\r\n\r\nHe grinned again. \"You know -- *free* food. From the free food store?\"\r\n\r\n\"You stole this?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, dummy. It's from the other store. The little one out behind the\r\nstore? Made of blue steel? Kind of funky smelling?\"\r\n\r\n\"You got this out of the garbage?\"\r\n\r\nHe flung his head back and cackled. \"Yes indeedy. You should *see* your\r\nface. Dude, it's OK. It's not like it was rotten. It was fresh -- just\r\na screwed up order. They threw it out in the box. They sprinkle rat\r\npoison over everything at closing-time, but if you get there quick,\r\nyou're OK. You should see what grocery stores throw out! Wait until\r\nbreakfast. I'm going to make you a fruit salad you won't believe. As\r\nsoon as one strawberry in the box goes a little green and fuzzy, the\r\nwhole thing is out --\"\r\n\r\nI tuned him out. The pizza was fine. It wasn't as if sitting in the\r\ndumpster would infect it or something.  If it was gross, that was only\r\nbecause it came from Domino's -- the worst pizza in town. I'd never\r\nliked their food, and I'd given it up altogether when I found out that\r\nthey bankrolled a bunch of ultra-crazy politicians who thought that\r\nglobal warming and evolution were satanic plots.\r\n\r\nIt was hard to shake the feeling of grossness, though.\r\n\r\nBut there *was* another way to look at it. Zeb had showed me a secret,\r\nsomething I hadn't anticipated: there was a whole hidden world out\r\nthere, a way of getting by without participating in the system.\r\n\r\n\"Freegans, huh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yogurt, too,\" he said, nodding vigorously. \"For the fruit salad. They\r\nthrow it out the day after the best-before date, but it's not as if it\r\ngoes green at midnight. It's yogurt, I mean, it's basically just rotten\r\nmilk to begin with.\"\r\n\r\nI swallowed. The pizza tasted funny. Rat poison. Spoiled yogurt. Furry\r\nstrawberries. This would take some getting used to.\r\n\r\nI ate another bite. Actually, Domino's pizza sucked a little less when\r\nyou got it for free.\r\n\r\nLiam's sleeping bag was warm and welcoming after a long, emotionally\r\nexhausting day. Van would have made contact with Barbara by now. She'd\r\nhave the video and the picture. I'd call her in the morning and find\r\nout what she thought I should do next. I'd have to come in once she\r\npublished, to back it all up.\r\n\r\nI thought about that as I closed my eyes, thought about what it would\r\nbe like to turn myself in, the cameras all rolling, following the\r\ninfamous M1k3y into one of those big, columnated buildings in Civic\r\nCenter.\r\n\r\nThe sound of the cars screaming by overhead turned into a kind of ocean\r\nsound as I drifted away. There were other tents nearby, homeless\r\npeople. I'd met a few of them that afternoon, before it got dark and we\r\nall retreated to huddle near our own tents. They were all older than\r\nme, rough looking and gruff. None of them looked crazy or violent,\r\nthough. Just like people who'd had bad luck, or made bad decisions, or\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nI must have fallen asleep, because I don't remember anything else until\r\na bright light was shined into my face, so bright it was blinding.\r\n\r\n\"That's him,\" said a voice behind the light.\r\n\r\n\"Bag him,\" said another voice, one I'd heard before, one I'd heard over\r\nand over again in my dreams, lecturing to me, demanding my passwords.\r\nSevere-haircut-woman.\r\n\r\nThe bag went over my head quickly and was cinched so tight at the\r\nthroat that I choked and threw up my freegan pizza. As I spasmed and\r\nchoked, hard hands bound my wrists, then my ankles. I was rolled onto a\r\nstretcher and hoisted, then carried into a vehicle, up a couple of\r\nclanging metal steps. They dropped me into a padded floor. There was no\r\nsound at all in the back of the vehicle once they closed the doors. The\r\npadding deadened everything except my own choking.\r\n\r\n\"Well, hello again,\" she said. I felt the van rock as she crawled in\r\nwith me. I was still choking, trying to gasp in a breath. Vomit filled\r\nmy mouth and trickled down my windpipe.\r\n\r\n\"We won't let you die,\" she said. \"If you stop breathing, we'll make\r\nsure you start again. So don't worry about it.\"\r\n\r\nI choked harder. I sipped at air. Some was getting through. Deep,\r\nwracking coughs shook my chest and back, dislodging some more of the\r\npuke. More breath.\r\n\r\n\"See?\" she said. \"Not so bad. Welcome home, M1k3y. We've got somewhere\r\nvery special to take you.\"\r\n\r\nI relaxed onto my back, feeling the van rock. The smell of used pizza\r\nwas overwhelming at first, but as with all strong stimuli, my brain\r\ngradually grew accustomed to it, filtered it out until it was just a\r\nfaint aroma. The rocking of the van was almost comforting.\r\n\r\nThat's when it happened. An incredible, deep calm that swept over me\r\nlike I was lying on the beach and the ocean had swept in and lifted me\r\nas gently as a parent, held me aloft and swept me out onto a warm sea\r\nunder a warm sun. After everything that had happened, I was caught, but\r\nit didn't matter. I had gotten the information to Barbara. I had\r\norganized the Xnet. I had won. And if I hadn't won, I had done\r\neverything I could have done. More than I ever thought I could do. I\r\ntook a mental inventory as I rode, thinking of everything that I had\r\naccomplished, that *we* had accomplished. The city, the country, the\r\nworld was full of people who wouldn't live the way DHS wanted us to\r\nlive. We'd fight forever. They couldn't jail us all.\r\n\r\nI sighed and smiled.\r\n\r\nShe'd been talking all along, I realized. I'd been so far into my happy\r\nplace that she'd just gone away.\r\n\r\n\"-- smart kid like you. You'd think that you'd know better than to mess\r\nwith us. We've had an eye on you since the day you walked out. We would\r\nhave caught you even if you hadn't gone crying to your lesbo journalist\r\ntraitor. I just don't get it -- we had an understanding, you and me...\"\r\n\r\nWe rumbled over a metal plate, the van's shocks rocking, and then the\r\nrocking changed. We were on water. Heading to Treasure Island. Hey,\r\nAnge was there. Darryl, too. Maybe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hood didn't come off until I was in my cell. They didn't bother\r\nwith the cuffs at my wrists and ankles, just rolled me off the\r\nstretcher and onto the floor. It was dark, but by the moonlight from\r\nthe single, tiny, high window, I could see that the mattress had been\r\ntaken off the cot. The room contained me, a toilet, a bed-frame, and a\r\nsink, and nothing else.\r\n\r\nI closed my eyes and let the ocean lift me. I floated away. Somewhere,\r\nfar below me, was my body. I could tell what would happen next. I was\r\nbeing left to piss myself. Again. I knew what that was like. I'd pissed\r\nmyself before. It smelled bad. It itched. It was humiliating, like\r\nbeing a baby.\r\n\r\nBut I'd survived it.\r\n\r\nI laughed. The sound was weird, and it drew me back into my body, back\r\nto the present. I laughed and laughed. I'd had the worst that they\r\ncould throw at me, and I'd survived it, and I'd *beaten them*, beaten\r\nthem for months, showed them up as chumps and despots. I'd *won*.\r\n\r\nI let my bladder cut loose. It was sore and full anyway, and no time\r\nlike the present.\r\n\r\nThe ocean swept me away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen morning came, two efficient, impersonal guards cut the bindings\r\noff of my wrists and ankles. I still couldn't walk -- when I stood, my\r\nlegs gave way like a stringless marionette's. Too much time in one\r\nposition. The guards pulled my arms over their shoulders and\r\nhalf-dragged/half-carried me down the familiar corridor. The bar codes\r\non the doors were curling up and dangling now, attacked by the salt\r\nair.\r\n\r\nI got an idea. \"Ange!\" I yelled. \"Darryl!\" I yelled. My guards yanked\r\nme along faster, clearly disturbed but not sure what to do about it.\r\n\"Guys, it's me, Marcus! Stay free!\"\r\n\r\nBehind one of the doors, someone sobbed. Someone else cried out in what\r\nsounded like Arabic. Then it was cacophony, a thousand different\r\nshouting voices.\r\n\r\nThey brought me to a new room. It was an old shower-room, with the\r\nshower-heads still present in the mould tiles.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, M1k3y,\" Severe Haircut said. \"You seem to have had an eventful\r\nmorning.\" She wrinkled her nose pointedly.\r\n\r\n\"I pissed myself,\" I said, cheerfully. \"You should try it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe we should give you a bath, then,\" she said. She nodded, and my\r\nguards carried me to another stretcher. This one had restraining straps\r\nrunning its length. They dropped me onto it and it was ice-cold and\r\nsoaked through. Before I knew it, they had the straps across my\r\nshoulders, hips and ankles. A minute later, three more straps were tied\r\ndown. A man's hands grabbed the railings by my head and released some\r\ncatches, and a moment later I was tilted down, my head below my feet.\r\n\r\n\"Let's start with something simple,\" she said. I craned my head to see\r\nher. She had turned to a desk with an Xbox on it, connected to an\r\nexpensive-looking flat-panel TV. \"I'd like you to tell me your login\r\nand password for your Pirate Party email, please?\"\r\n\r\nI closed my eyes and let the ocean carry me off the beach.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what waterboarding is, M1k3y?\" Her voice reeled me in.\r\n\"You get strapped down like this, and we pour water over your head, up\r\nyour nose and down your mouth. You can't suppress the gag reflex. They\r\ncall it a simulated execution, and from what I can tell from this side\r\nof the room, that's a fair assessment. You won't be able to fight the\r\nfeeling that you're dying.\"\r\n\r\nI tried to go away. I'd heard of waterboarding. This was it, real\r\ntorture. And this was just the beginning.\r\n\r\nI couldn't go away. The ocean didn't sweep in and lift me. There was a\r\ntightness in my chest, my eyelids fluttered. I could feel clammy piss\r\non my legs and clammy sweat in my hair. My skin itched from the dried\r\npuke.\r\n\r\nShe swam into view above me. \"Let's start with the login,\" she said.\r\n\r\nI closed my eyes, squeezed them shut.\r\n\r\n\"Give him a drink,\" she said.\r\n\r\nI heard people moving. I took a deep breath and held it.\r\n\r\nThe water started as a trickle, a ladleful of water gently poured over\r\nmy chin, my lips. Up my upturned nostrils. It went back into my throat,\r\nstarting to choke me, but I wouldn't cough, wouldn't gasp and suck it\r\ninto my lungs. I held onto my breath and squeezed my eyes harder.\r\n\r\nThere was a commotion from outside the room, a sound of chaotic boots\r\nstamping, angry, outraged shouts. The dipper was emptied into my face.\r\n\r\nI heard her mutter something to someone in the room, then to me she\r\nsaid, \"Just the login, Marcus. It's a simple request. What could I do\r\nwith your login, anyway?\"\r\n\r\nThis time, it was a bucket of water, all at once, a flood that didn't\r\nstop, it must have been gigantic. I couldn't help it. I gasped and\r\naspirated the water into my lungs, coughed and took more water in. I\r\nknew they wouldn't kill me, but I couldn't convince my body of that. In\r\nevery fiber of my being, I knew I was going to die. I couldn't even cry\r\n-- the water was still pouring over me.\r\n\r\nThen it stopped. I coughed and coughed and coughed, but at the angle I\r\nwas at, the water I coughed up dribbled back into my nose and burned\r\ndown my sinuses.\r\n\r\nThe coughs were so deep they hurt, hurt my ribs and my hips as I\r\ntwisted against them. I hated how my body was betraying me, how my mind\r\ncouldn't control my body, but there was nothing for it.\r\n\r\nFinally, the coughing subsided enough for me to take in what was going\r\non around me. People were shouting and it sounded like someone was\r\nscuffling, wrestling. I opened my eyes and blinked into the bright\r\nlight, then craned my neck, still coughing a little.\r\n\r\nThe room had a lot more people in it than it had had when we started.\r\nMost of them seemed to be wearing body armor, helmets, and\r\nsmoked-plastic visors. They were shouting at the Treasure Island\r\nguards, who were shouting back, necks corded with veins.\r\n\r\n\"Stand down!\" one of the body-armors said. \"Stand down and put your\r\nhands in the air. You are under arrest!\"\r\n\r\nSevere haircut woman was talking on her phone. One of the body armors\r\nnoticed her and he moved swiftly to her and batted her phone away with\r\na gloved hand. Everyone fell silent as it sailed through the air in an\r\narc that spanned the small room, clattering to the ground in a shower\r\nof parts.\r\n\r\nThe silence broke and the body-armors moved into the room. Two grabbed\r\neach of my torturers. I almost managed a smile at the look on Severe\r\nHaircut's face when two men grabbed her by the shoulders, turned her\r\naround, and yanked a set of plastic handcuffs around her wrists.\r\n\r\nOne of the body-armors moved forward from the doorway. He had a video\r\ncamera on his shoulder, a serious rig with blinding white light. He got\r\nthe whole room, circling me twice while he got me. I found myself\r\nstaying perfectly still, as though I was sitting for a portrait.\r\n\r\nIt was ridiculous.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think you could get me off of this thing?\" I managed to get it\r\nall out with only a little choking.\r\n\r\nTwo more body armors moved up to me, one a woman, and began to unstrap\r\nme. They flipped their visors up and smiled at me. They had red crosses\r\non their shoulders and helmets.\r\n\r\nBeneath the red crosses was another insignia: CHP. California Highway\r\nPatrol. They were State Troopers.\r\n\r\nI started to ask what they were doing there, and that's when I saw\r\nBarbara Stratford. She'd evidently been held back in the corridor, but\r\nnow she came in pushing and shoving. \"There you are,\" she said,\r\nkneeling beside me and grabbing me in the longest, hardest hug of my\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThat's when I knew it -- Guantanamo by the Bay was in the hands of its\r\nenemies. I was saved.\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nChapter 21\r\n\r\n[[This chapter is dedicated to Pages Books in Toronto, Canada.

When I finished, Barbara was in tears.\r\n\r\n\"Your parents --\" she began.\r\n\r\nI felt like I might throw up again. God, my poor folks. What they must\r\nhave gone through.\r\n\r\n\"Are they here?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she said. \"It's complicated,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're still under arrest, Marcus. Everyone here is. They can't just\r\nsweep in and throw open the doors. Everyone here is going to have to be\r\nprocessed through the criminal justice system. It could take, well, it\r\ncould take months.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to have to stay here for *months*?\"\r\n\r\nShe grabbed my hands. \"No, I think we're going to be able to get you\r\narraigned and released on bail pretty fast. But pretty fast is a\r\nrelative term. I wouldn't expect anything to happen today. And it's not\r\ngoing to be like those people had it. It will be humane. There will be\r\nreal food. No interrogations. Visits from your family.\r\n\r\n\"Just because the DHS is out, it doesn't mean that you get to just walk\r\nout of here. What's happened here is that we're getting rid of the\r\nbizarro-world version of the justice system they'd instituted and\r\nreplacing it with the old system. The system with judges, open trials\r\nand lawyers.\r\n\r\n\"So we can try to get you transferred to a juvie facility on the\r\nmainland, but Marcus, those places can be really rough. Really, really\r\nrough. This might be the best place for you until we get you bailed\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nBailed out. Of course. I was a criminal -- I hadn't been charged yet,\r\nbut there were bound to be plenty of charges they could think of. It\r\nwas practically illegal just to think impure thoughts about the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nShe gave my hands another squeeze. \"It sucks, but this is how it has to\r\nbe. The point is, it's *over*. The Governor has thrown the DHS out of\r\nthe State, dismantled every checkpoint. The Attorney General has issued\r\nwarrants for any law-enforcement officers involved in 'stress\r\ninterrogations' and secret imprisonments. They'll go to jail, Marcus,\r\nand it's because of what you did.\"\r\n\r\nI was numb. I heard the words, but they hardly made sense. Somehow, it\r\nwas over, but it wasn't over.\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" she said. \"We probably have an hour or two before this all\r\nsettles down, before they come back and put you away again. What do you\r\nwant to do? Walk on the beach? Get a meal? These people had an\r\nincredible staff room -- we raided it on the way in. Gourmet all the\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\nAt last a question I could answer. \"I want to find Ange. I want to find\r\nDarryl.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI tried to use a computer I found to look up their cell-numbers, but it\r\nwanted a password, so we were reduced to walking the corridors, calling\r\nout their names. Behind the cell-doors, prisoners screamed back at us,\r\nor cried, or begged us to let them go. They didn't understand what had\r\njust happened, couldn't see their former guards being herded onto the\r\ndocks in plastic handcuffs, taken away by California state SWAT teams.\r\n\r\n\"Ange!\" I called over the din, \"Ange Carvelli! Darryl Glover! It's\r\nMarcus!\"\r\n\r\nWe'd walked the whole length of the cell-block and they hadn't\r\nanswered. I felt like crying. They'd been shipped overseas -- they were\r\nin Syria or worse. I'd never see them again.\r\n\r\nI sat down and leaned against the corridor wall and put my face in my\r\nhands. I saw Severe Haircut Woman's face, saw her smirk as she asked me\r\nfor my login. She had done this. She would go to jail for it, but that\r\nwasn't enough. I thought that when I saw her again, I might kill her.\r\nShe deserved it.\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" Barbara said, \"Come on, Marcus. Don't give up. There's more\r\naround here, come on.\"\r\n\r\nShe was right. All the doors we'd passed in the cellblock were old,\r\nrusting things that dated back to when the base was first built. But at\r\nthe very end of the corridor, sagging open, was a new high-security\r\ndoor as thick as a dictionary. We pulled it open and ventured into the\r\ndark corridor within.\r\n\r\nThere were four more cell-doors here, doors without bar codes. Each had\r\na small electronic keypad mounted on it.\r\n\r\n\"Darryl?\" I said. \"Ange?\"\r\n\r\n\"Marcus?\"\r\n\r\nIt was Ange, calling out from behind the furthest door. Ange, my Ange,\r\nmy angel.\r\n\r\n\"Ange!\" I cried. \"It's me, it's me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh God, Marcus,\" she choked out, and then it was all sobs.\r\n\r\nI pounded on the other doors. \"Darryl! Darryl, are you here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm here.\" The voice was very small, and very hoarse. \"I'm here. I'm\r\nvery, very sorry. Please. I'm very sorry.\"\r\n\r\nHe sounded... broken. Shattered.\r\n\r\n\"It's me, D,\" I said, leaning on his door. \"It's Marcus. It's over --\r\nthey arrested the guards. They kicked the Department of Homeland\r\nSecurity out. We're getting trials, open trials. And we get to testify\r\nagainst *them*.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"Please, I'm so sorry.\"\r\n\r\nThe California patrolmen came to the door then. They still had their\r\ncamera rolling. \"Ms Stratford?\" one said. He had his faceplate up and\r\nhe looked like any other cop, not like my savior. Like someone come to\r\nlock me up.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Sanchez,\" she said. \"We've located two of the prisoners of\r\ninterest here. I'd like to see them released and inspect them for\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ma'am, we don't have access codes for those doors yet,\" he said.\r\n\r\nShe held up her hand. \"That wasn't the arrangement. I was to have\r\ncomplete access to this facility. That came direct from the Governor,\r\nsir. We aren't budging until you open these cells.\" Her face was\r\nperfectly smooth, without a single hint of give or flex. She meant it.\r\n\r\nThe Captain looked like he needed sleep. He grimaced. \"I'll see what I\r\ncan do,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey did manage to open the cells, finally, about half an hour later.\r\nIt took three tries, but they eventually got the right codes entered,\r\nmatching them to the arphids on the ID badges they'd taken off the\r\nguards they'd arrested.\r\n\r\nThey got into Ange's cell first. She was dressed in a hospital gown,\r\nopen at the back, and her cell was even more bare than mine had been --\r\njust padding all over, no sink or bed, no light. She emerged blinking\r\ninto the corridor and the police camera was on her, its bright lights\r\nin her face. Barbara stepped protectively between us and it. Ange\r\nstepped tentatively out of her cell, shuffling a little. There was\r\nsomething wrong with her eyes, with her face. She was crying, but that\r\nwasn't it.\r\n\r\n\"They drugged me,\" she said. \"When I wouldn't stop screaming for a\r\nlawyer.\"\r\n\r\nThat's when I hugged her. She sagged against me, but she squeezed back,\r\ntoo. She smelled stale and sweaty, and I smelled no better. I never\r\nwanted to let go.\r\n\r\nThat's when they opened Darryl's cell.\r\n\r\nHe had shredded his paper hospital gown. He was curled up, naked, in\r\nthe back of the cell, shielding himself from the camera and our stares.\r\nI ran to him.\r\n\r\n\"D,\" I whispered in his ear. \"D, it's me. It's Marcus. It's over. The\r\nguards have been arrested. We're going to get bail, we're going home.\"\r\n\r\nHe trembled and squeezed his eyes shut. \"I'm sorry,\" he whispered, and\r\nturned his face away.\r\n\r\nThey took me away then, a cop in body-armor and Barbara, took me back\r\nto my cell and locked the door, and that's where I spent the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't remember much about the trip to the courthouse. They had me\r\nchained to five other prisoners, all of whom had been in for a lot\r\nlonger than me. One only spoke Arabic -- he was an old man, and he\r\ntrembled. The others were all young. I was the only white one. Once we\r\nhad been gathered on the deck of the ferry, I saw that nearly everyone\r\non Treasure Island had been one shade of brown or another.\r\n\r\nI had only been inside for one night, but it was too long. There was a\r\nlight drizzle coming down, normally the sort of thing that would make\r\nme hunch my shoulders and look down, but today I joined everyone else\r\nin craning my head back at the infinite gray sky, reveling in the\r\nstinging wet as we raced across the bay to the ferry-docks.\r\n\r\nThey took us away in buses. The shackles made climbing into the buses\r\nawkward, and it took a long time for everyone to load. No one cared.\r\nWhen we weren't struggling to solve the geometry problem of six people,\r\none chain, narrow bus-aisle, we were just looking around at the city\r\naround us, up the hill at the buildings.\r\n\r\nAll I could think of was finding Darryl and Ange, but neither were in\r\nevidence. It was a big crowd and we weren't allowed to move freely\r\nthrough it. The state troopers who handled us were gentle enough, but\r\nthey were still big, armored and armed. I kept thinking I saw Darryl in\r\nthe crowd, but it was always someone else with that same beaten,\r\nhunched look that he'd had in his cell. He wasn't the only broken one.\r\n\r\nAt the courthouse, they marched us into interview rooms in our shackle\r\ngroup. An ACLU lawyer took our information and asked us a few questions\r\n-- when she got to me, she smiled and greeted me by name -- and then\r\nled us into the courtroom before the judge. He wore an actual robe, and\r\nseemed to be in a good mood.\r\n\r\nThe deal seemed to be that anyone who had a family member to post bail\r\ncould go free, and everyone else got sent to prison. The ACLU lawyer\r\ndid a lot of talking to the judge, asking for a few more hours while\r\nthe prisoners' families were rounded up and brought to the court-house.\r\nThe judge was pretty good about it, but when I realized that some of\r\nthese people had been locked up since the bridge blew, taken for dead\r\nby their families, without trial, subjected to interrogation,\r\nisolation, torture -- I wanted to just break the chains myself and set\r\neveryone free.\r\n\r\nWhen I was brought before the judge, he looked down at me and took off\r\nhis glasses. He looked tired. The ACLU lawyer looked tired. The\r\nbailiffs looked tired. Behind me, I could hear a sudden buzz of\r\nconversation as my name was called by the bailiff. The judge rapped his\r\ngavel once, without looking away from me. He scrubbed at his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Mr Yallow,\" he said, \"the prosecution has identified you as a flight\r\nrisk. I think they have a point. You certainly have more, shall we say,\r\n*history*, than the other people here. I am tempted to hold you over\r\nfor trial, no matter how much bail your parents are prepared to post.\"\r\n\r\nMy lawyer started to say something, but the judge silenced her with a\r\nlook. He scrubbed at his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Do you have anything to say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had the chance to run,\" I said. \"Last week. Someone offered to take\r\nme away, get me out of town, help me build a new identity. Instead I\r\nstole her phone, escaped from our truck, and ran away. I turned over\r\nher phone -- which had evidence about my friend, Darryl Glover, on it\r\n-- to a journalist and hid out here, in town.\"\r\n\r\n\"You stole a phone?\"\r\n\r\n\"I decided that I couldn't run. That I had to face justice -- that my\r\nfreedom wasn't worth anything if I was a wanted man, or if the city was\r\nstill under the DHS. If my friends were still locked up. That freedom\r\nfor me wasn't as important as a free country.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you did steal a phone.\"\r\n\r\nI nodded. \"I did. I plan on giving it back, if I ever find the young\r\nwoman in question.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, thank you for that speech, Mr Yallow. You are a very well spoken\r\nyoung man.\" He glared at the prosecutor. \"Some would say a very brave\r\nman, too. There was a certain video on the news this morning. It\r\nsuggested that you had some legitimate reason to evade the authorities.\r\nIn light of that, and of your little speech here, I will grant bail,\r\nbut I will also ask the prosecutor to add a charge of Misdemeanor Petty\r\nTheft to the count, as regards the matter of the phone. For this, I\r\nexpect another $50,000 in bail.\"\r\n\r\nHe banged his gavel again, and my lawyer gave my hand a squeeze.\r\n\r\nHe looked down at me again and re-seated his glasses. He had dandruff,\r\nthere on the shoulders of his robe. A little more rained down as his\r\nglasses touched his wiry, curly hair.\r\n\r\n\"You can go now, young man. Stay out of trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI turned to go and someone tackled me. It was Dad. He literally lifted\r\nme off my feet, hugging me so hard my ribs creaked. He hugged me the\r\nway I remembered him hugging me when I was a little boy, when he'd spin\r\nme around and around in hilarious, vomitous games of airplane that\r\nended with him tossing me in the air and catching me and squeezing me\r\nlike that, so hard it almost hurt.\r\n\r\nA set of softer hands pried me gently out of his arms. Mom. She held me\r\nat arm's length for a moment, searching my face for something, not\r\nsaying anything, tears streaming down her face. She smiled and it\r\nturned into a sob and then she was holding me too, and Dad's arm\r\nencircled us both.\r\n\r\nWhen they let go, I managed to finally say something. \"Darryl?\"\r\n\r\n\"His father met me somewhere else. He's in the hospital.\"\r\n\r\n\"When can I see him?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's our next stop,\" Dad said. He was grim. \"He doesn't --\" He\r\nstopped. \"They say he'll be OK,\" he said. His voice was choked.\r\n\r\n\"How about Ange?\"\r\n\r\n\"Her mother took her home. She wanted to wait here for you, but...\"\r\n\r\nI understood. I felt full of understanding now, for how all the\r\nfamilies of all the people who'd been locked away must feel. The\r\ncourtroom was full of tears and hugs, and even the bailiffs couldn't\r\nstop it.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go see Darryl,\" I said. \"And let me borrow your phone?\"\r\n\r\nI called Ange on the way to the hospital where they were keeping Darryl\r\n-- San Francisco General, just down the street from us -- and arranged\r\nto see her after dinner. She talked in a hurried whisper. Her mom\r\nwasn't sure whether to punish her or not, but Ange didn't want to tempt\r\nfate.\r\n\r\nThere were two state troopers in the corridor where Darryl was being\r\nheld. They were holding off a legion of reporters who stood on tiptoe\r\nto see around them and get pictures. The flashes popped in our eyes\r\nlike strobes, and I shook my head to clear it. My parents had brought\r\nme clean clothes and I'd changed in the back seat, but I still felt\r\ngross, even after scrubbing myself in the court-house bathrooms.\r\n\r\nSome of the reporters called my name. Oh yeah, that's right, I was\r\nfamous now. The state troopers gave me a look, too -- either they'd\r\nrecognized my face or my name when the reporters called it out.\r\n\r\nDarryl's father met us at the door of his hospital room, speaking in a\r\nwhisper too low for the reporters to hear. He was in civvies, the jeans\r\nand sweater I normally thought of him wearing, but he had his service\r\nribbons pinned to his breast.\r\n\r\n\"He's sleeping,\" he said. \"He woke up a little while ago and he started\r\ncrying. He couldn't stop. They gave him something to help him sleep.\"\r\n\r\nHe led us in, and there was Darryl, his hair clean and combed, sleeping\r\nwith his mouth open. There was white stuff at the corners of his mouth.\r\nHe had a semi-private room, and in the other bed there was an older\r\nArab-looking guy, in his 40s. I realized it was the guy I'd been\r\nchained to on the way off of Treasure Island. We exchanged embarrassed\r\nwaves.\r\n\r\nThen I turned back to Darryl. I took his hand. His nails had been\r\nchewed to the quick. He'd been a nail-biter when he was a kid, but he'd\r\nkicked the habit when we got to high school. I think Van talked him out\r\nof it, telling him how gross it was for him to have his fingers in his\r\nmouth all the time.\r\n\r\nI heard my parents and Darryl's dad take a step away, drawing the\r\ncurtains around us. I put my face down next to his on the pillow. He\r\nhad a straggly, patchy beard that reminded me of Zeb.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, D,\" I said. \"You made it. You're going to be OK.\"\r\n\r\nHe snored a little. I almost said, \"I love you,\" a phrase I'd only said\r\nto one non-family-member ever, a phrase that was weird to say to\r\nanother guy. In the end, I just gave his hand another squeeze. Poor\r\nDarryl.\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nEpilogue\r\n\r\n[[This chapter is dedicated to Hudson Booksellers, the booksellers that\r\nare in practically every airport in the USA.

I wasn't the only\r\none who'd come into work on the holiday weekend, but I was the only one\r\nwhose excuse was that my day-release program wouldn't let me leave\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nIn the end, they convicted me of stealing Masha's phone. Can you\r\nbelieve that? The prosecution had done a deal with my lawyer to drop\r\nall charges related to \"Electronic terrorism\" and \"inciting riots\" in\r\nexchange for my pleading guilty to the misdemeanor petty theft charge.\r\nI got three months in a day-release program with a half-way house for\r\njuvenile offenders in the Mission. I slept at the halfway house,\r\nsharing a dorm with a bunch of actual criminals, gang kids and druggie\r\nkids, a couple of real nuts. During the day, I was \"free\" to go out and\r\nwork at my \"job.\"\r\n\r\n\"Marcus, they're letting her go,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Who?\"\r\n\r\n\"Johnstone, Carrie Johnstone,\" she said. \"The closed military tribunal\r\ncleared her of any wrongdoing. The file is sealed. She's being returned\r\nto active duty. They're sending her to Iraq.\"\r\n\r\nCarrie Johnstone was Severe Haircut Woman's name. It came out in the\r\npreliminary hearings at the California Superior Court, but that was\r\njust about all that came out. She wouldn't say a word about who she\r\ntook orders from, what she'd done, who had been imprisoned and why. She\r\njust sat, perfectly silent, day after day, in the courthouse.\r\n\r\nThe Feds, meanwhile, had blustered and shouted about the Governor's\r\n\"unilateral, illegal\" shut-down of the Treasure Island facility, and\r\nthe Mayor's eviction of fed cops from San Francisco. A lot of those\r\ncops had ended up in state prisons, along with the guards from\r\nGitmo-by-the-Bay.\r\n\r\nThen, one day, there was no statement from the White House, nothing\r\nfrom the state capitol. And the next day, there was a dry, tense\r\npress-conference held jointly on the steps of the Governor's mansion,\r\nwhere the head of the DHS and the governor announced their\r\n\"understanding.\"\r\n\r\nThe DHS would hold a closed, military tribunal to investigate \"possible\r\nerrors in judgment\" committed after the attack on the Bay Bridge. The\r\ntribunal would use every tool at its disposal to ensure that criminal\r\nacts were properly punished. In return, control over DHS operations in\r\nCalifornia would go through the State Senate, which would have the\r\npower to shut down, inspect, or re-prioritize all homeland security in\r\nthe state.\r\n\r\nThe roar of the reporters had been deafening and Barbara had gotten the\r\nfirst question in. \"Mr Governor, with all due respect: we have\r\nincontrovertible video evidence that Marcus Yallow, a citizen of this\r\nstate, native born, was subjected to a simulated execution by DHS\r\nofficers, apparently acting on orders from the White House. Is the\r\nState really willing to abandon any pretense of justice for its\r\ncitizens in the face of illegal, barbaric *torture*?\" Her voice\r\ntrembled, but didn't crack.\r\n\r\nThe Governor spread his hands. \"The military tribunals will accomplish\r\njustice. If Mr Yallow -- or any other person who has cause to fault the\r\nDepartment of Homeland Security -- wants further justice, he is, of\r\ncourse, entitled to sue for such damages as may be owing to him from\r\nthe federal government.\"\r\n\r\nThat's what I was doing. Over twenty thousand civil lawsuits were filed\r\nagainst the DHS in the week after the Governor's announcement. Mine was\r\nbeing handled by the ACLU, and they'd filed motions to get at the\r\nresults of the closed military tribunals. So far, the courts were\r\npretty sympathetic to this.\r\n\r\nBut I hadn't expected this.\r\n\r\n\"She got off totally Scot-free?\"\r\n\r\n\"The press release doesn't say much. 'After a thorough examination of\r\nthe events in San Francisco and in the special anti-terror detention\r\ncenter on Treasure Island, it is the finding of this tribunal that Ms\r\nJohnstone's actions do not warrant further discipline.' There's that\r\nword, 'further' -- like they've already punished her.\"\r\n\r\nI snorted. I'd dreamed of Carrie Johnstone nearly every night since I\r\nwas released from Gitmo-by-the-Bay. I'd seen her face looming over\r\nmine, that little snarly smile as she told the man to give me a\r\n\"drink.\"\r\n\r\n\"Marcus --\" Barbara said, but I cut her off.\r\n\r\n\"It's fine. It's fine. I'm going to do a video about this. Get it out\r\nover the weekend. Mondays are big days for viral video. Everyone'll be\r\ncoming back from the holiday weekend, looking for something funny to\r\nforward around school or the office.\"\r\n\r\nI saw a shrink twice a week as part of my deal at the halfway house.\r\nOnce I'd gotten over seeing that as some kind of punishment, it had\r\nbeen good. He'd helped me focus on doing constructive things when I was\r\nupset, instead of letting it eat me up. The videos helped.\r\n\r\n\"I have to go,\" I said, swallowing hard to keep the emotion out of my\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"Take care of yourself, Marcus,\" Barbara said.\r\n\r\nAnge hugged me from behind as I hung up the phone. \"I just read about\r\nit online,\" she said. She read a million newsfeeds, pulling them with a\r\nheadline reader that sucked up stories as fast as they ended up on the\r\nwire. She was our official blogger, and she was good at it, snipping\r\nout the interesting stories and throwing them online like a short order\r\ncook turning around breakfast orders.\r\n\r\nI turned around in her arms so that I was hugging her from in front.\r\nTruth be told, we hadn't gotten a lot of work done that day. I wasn't\r\nallowed to be out of the halfway house after dinner time, and she\r\ncouldn't visit me there. We saw each other around the office, but there\r\nwere usually a lot of other people around, which kind of put a crimp in\r\nour cuddling. Being alone in the office for a day was too much\r\ntemptation. It was hot and sultry, too, which meant we were both in\r\ntank-tops and shorts, a lot of skin-to-skin contact as we worked next\r\nto each other.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to make a video,\" I said. \"I want to release it today.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" she said. \"Let's do it.\"\r\n\r\nAnge read the press-release. I did a little monologue, synched over\r\nthat famous footage of me on the water-board, eyes wild in the harsh\r\nlight of the camera, tears streaming down my face, hair matted and\r\nflecked with barf.\r\n\r\n\"This is me. I am on a waterboard. I am being tortured in a simulated\r\nexecution. The torture is supervised by a woman called Carrie\r\nJohnstone. She works for the government. You might remember her from\r\nthis video.\"\r\n\r\nI cut in the video of Johnstone and Kurt Rooney. \"That's Johnstone and\r\nSecretary of State Kurt Rooney, the president's chief strategist.\"\r\n\r\n*\"The nation does not love that city. As far as they're concerned, it\r\nis a Sodom and Gomorrah of fags and atheists who deserve to rot in\r\nhell. The only reason the country cares what they think in San\r\nFrancisco is that they had the good fortune to have been blown to hell\r\nby some Islamic terrorists.\"*\r\n\r\n\"He's talking about the city where I live. At last count, 4,215 of my\r\nneighbors were killed on the day he's talking about. But some of them\r\nmay not have been killed. Some of them disappeared into the same prison\r\nwhere I was tortured. Some mothers and fathers, children and lovers,\r\nbrothers and sisters will never see their loved ones again -- because\r\nthey were secretly imprisoned in an illegal jail right here in the San\r\nFrancisco Bay. They were shipped overseas. The records were meticulous,\r\nbut Carrie Johnstone has the encryption keys.\" I cut back to Carrie\r\nJohnstone, the footage of her sitting at the board table with Rooney,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\nI cut in the footage of Johnstone being arrested. \"When they arrested\r\nher, I thought we'd get justice. All the people she broke and\r\ndisappeared. But the president --\" I cut to a still of him laughing and\r\nplaying golf on one of his many holidays \"-- and his Chief Strategist\r\n--\" now a still of Rooney shaking hands with an infamous terrorist\r\nleader who used to be on \"our side\" \"-- intervened. They sent her to a\r\nsecret military tribunal and now that tribunal has cleared her.\r\nSomehow, they saw nothing wrong with all of this.\"\r\n\r\nI cut in a photomontage of the hundreds of shots of prisoners in their\r\ncells that Barbara had published on the Bay Guardian's site the day we\r\nwere released. \"We elected these people. We pay their salaries. They're\r\nsupposed to be on our side. They're supposed to defend our freedoms.\r\nBut these people --\" a series of shots of Johnstone and the others\r\nwho'd been sent to the tribunal \"-- betrayed our trust. The election is\r\nfour months away. That's a lot of time. Enough for you to go out and\r\nfind five of your neighbors -- five people who've given up on voting\r\nbecause their choice is 'none of the above.'\r\n\r\n\"Talk to your neighbors. Make them promise to vote. Make them promise\r\nto take the country back from the torturers and thugs. The people who\r\nlaughed at my friends as they lay fresh in their graves at the bottom\r\nof the harbor. Make them promise to talk to their neighbors.\r\n\r\n\"Most of us choose none of the above. It's not working. You have to\r\nchoose -- choose freedom.\r\n\r\n\"My name is Marcus Yallow. I was tortured by my country, but I still\r\nlove it here. I'm seventeen years old. I want to grow up in a free\r\ncountry. I want to live in a free country.\"\r\n\r\nI faded out to the logo of the website. Ange had built it, with help\r\nfrom Jolu, who got us all the free hosting we could ever need on\r\nPigspleen.\r\n\r\nThe office was an interesting place. Technically we were called\r\nCoalition of Voters for a Free America, but everyone called us the\r\nXnetters. The organization -- a charitable nonprofit -- had been\r\nco-founded by Barbara and some of her lawyer friends right after the\r\nliberation of Treasure Island. The funding was kicked off by some tech\r\nmillionaires who couldn't believe that a bunch of hacker kids had\r\nkicked the DHS's ass. Sometimes, they'd ask us to go down the peninsula\r\nto Sand Hill Road, where all the venture capitalists were, and give a\r\nlittle presentation on Xnet technology. There were about a zillion\r\nstartups who were trying to make a buck on the Xnet.\r\n\r\nWhatever -- I didn't have to have anything to do with it, and I got a\r\ndesk and an office with a storefront, right there on Valencia Street,\r\nwhere we gave away ParanoidXbox CDs and held workshops on building\r\nbetter WiFi antennas. A surprising number of average people dropped in\r\nto make personal donations, both of hardware (you can run ParanoidLinux\r\non just about anything, not just Xbox Universals) and cash money. They\r\nloved us.\r\n\r\nThe big plan was to launch our own ARG in September, just in time for\r\nthe election, and to really tie it in with signing up voters and\r\ngetting them to the polls. Only 42 percent of Americans showed up at\r\nthe polls for the last election -- nonvoters had a huge majority. I\r\nkept trying to get Darryl and Van to one of our planning sessions, but\r\nthey kept on declining. They were spending a lot of time together, and\r\nVan insisted that it was totally nonromantic. Darryl wouldn't talk to\r\nme much at all, though he sent me long emails about just about\r\neverything that wasn't about Van or terrorism or prison.\r\n\r\nAnge squeezed my hand. \"God, I hate that woman,\" she said.\r\n\r\nI nodded. \"Just one more rotten thing this country's done to Iraq,\" I\r\nsaid. \"If they sent her to my town, I'd probably become a terrorist.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did become a terrorist when they sent her to your town.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I did,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to Ms Galvez's hearing on Monday?\"\r\n\r\n\"Totally.\" I'd introduced Ange to Ms Galvez a couple weeks before, when\r\nmy old teacher invited me over for dinner. The teacher's union had\r\ngotten a hearing for her before the board of the Unified School\r\nDistrict to argue for getting her old job back. They said that Fred\r\nBenson was coming out of (early) retirement to testify against her. I\r\nwas looking forward to seeing her again.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to go get a burrito?\"\r\n\r\n\"Totally.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me get my hot-sauce,\" she said.\r\n\r\nI checked my email one more time -- my PirateParty email, which still\r\ngot a dribble of messages from old Xnetters who hadn't found my\r\nCoalition of Voters address yet.\r\n\r\nThe latest message was from a throwaway email address from one of the\r\nnew Brazilian anonymizers.\r\n\r\n> Found her, thanks. You didn't tell me she was so h4wt.\r\n\r\n\"Who's *that* from?\"\r\n\r\nI laughed. \"Zeb,\" I said. \"Remember Zeb? I gave him Masha's email\r\naddress. I figured, if they're both underground, might as well\r\nintroduce them to one another.\"\r\n\r\n\"He thinks Masha is *cute*?\"\r\n\r\n\"Give the guy a break, he's clearly had his mind warped by\r\ncircumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah -- was your mind warped by circumstances?\"\r\n\r\nI held Ange out at arm's length and looked her up and down and up and\r\ndown. I held her cheeks and stared through her thick-framed glasses\r\ninto her big, mischievous tilted eyes. I ran my fingers through her\r\nhair.\r\n\r\n\"Ange, I've never thought more clearly in my whole life.\"\r\n\r\nShe kissed me then, and I kissed her back, and it was some time before\r\nwe went out for that burrito.\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nAfterword by Bruce Schneier\r\n\r\nI'm a security technologist.  My job is making people secure.\r\n\r\nI think about security systems and how to break them.  Then, how to\r\nmake them more secure.  Computer security systems.  Surveillance\r\nsystems.  Airplane security systems and voting machines and RFID chips\r\nand everything else.\r\n\r\nCory invited me into the last few pages of his book because he wanted\r\nme to tell you that security is fun.  It's incredibly fun.  It's cat\r\nand mouse, who can outsmart whom, hunter versus hunted fun.  I think\r\nit's the most fun job you can possibly have.  If you thought it was fun\r\nto read about Marcus outsmarting the gait-recognition cameras with\r\nrocks in his shoes, think of how much more fun it would be if you were\r\nthe first person in the world to think of that.\r\n\r\nWorking in security means knowing a lot about technology.  It might\r\nmean knowing about computers and networks, or cameras and how they\r\nwork, or the chemistry of bomb detection.  But really, security is a\r\nmindset.  It's a way of thinking.  Marcus is a great example of that\r\nway of thinking.  He's always looking for ways a security system fails.\r\n I'll bet he couldn't walk into a store without figuring out a way to\r\nshoplift.  Not that he'd do it -- there's a difference between knowing\r\nhow to defeat a security system and actually defeating it -- but he'd\r\nknow he could.\r\n\r\nIt's how security people think. We're constantly looking at security\r\nsystems and how to get around them; we can't help it.\r\n\r\nThis kind of thinking is important no matter what side of security\r\nyou're on.  If you've been hired to build a shoplift-proof store, you'd\r\nbetter know how to shoplift.  If you're designing a camera system that\r\ndetects individual gaits, you'd better plan for people putting rocks in\r\ntheir shoes.  Because if you don't, you're not going to design anything\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nSo when you're wandering through your day, take a moment to look at the\r\nsecurity systems around you.  Look at the cameras in the stores you\r\nshop at.  (Do they prevent crime, or just move it next door?)  See how\r\na restaurant operates.  (If you pay after you eat, why don't more\r\npeople just leave without paying?)  Pay attention at airport security. \r\n(How could you get a weapon onto an airplane?)  Watch what the teller\r\ndoes at a bank.  (Bank security is designed to prevent tellers from\r\nstealing just as much as it is to prevent you from stealing.)  Stare at\r\nan anthill.  (Insects are all about security.)  Read the Constitution,\r\nand notice all the ways it provides people with security against\r\ngovernment. Look at traffic lights and door locks and all the security\r\nsystems on television and in the movies.  Figure out how they work,\r\nwhat threats they protect against and what threats they don't, how they\r\nfail, and how they can be exploited.\r\n\r\nSpend enough time doing this, and you'll find yourself thinking\r\ndifferently about the world.  You'll start noticing that many of the\r\nsecurity systems out there don't actually do what they claim to, and\r\nthat much of our national security is a waste of money.  You'll\r\nunderstand privacy as essential to security, not in opposition.  You'll\r\nstop worrying about things other people worry about, and start worrying\r\nabout things other people don't even think about.\r\n\r\nSometimes you'll notice something about security that no one has ever\r\nthought about before.  And maybe you'll figure out a new way to break a\r\nsecurity system.\r\n\r\nIt was only a few years ago that someone invented phishing.\r\n\r\nI'm frequently amazed how easy it is to break some pretty big-name\r\nsecurity systems.  There are a lot of reasons for this, but the big one\r\nis that it's impossible to prove that something is secure.  All you can\r\ndo is try to break it --  if you fail, you know that it's secure enough\r\nto keep *you* out, but what about someone who's smarter than you?\r\nAnyone can design a security system so strong he himself can't break\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThink about that for a second, because it's not obvious.  No one is\r\nqualified to analyze their own security designs, because the designer\r\nand the analyzer will be the same person, with the same limits. \r\nSomeone else has to analyze the security, because it has to be secure\r\nagainst things the designers didn't think of.\r\n\r\nThis means that all of us have to analyze the security that other\r\npeople design.  And surprisingly often, one of us breaks it.  Marcus's\r\nexploits aren't far-fetched; that kind of thing happens all the time. \r\nGo onto the net and look up \"bump key\" or \"Bic pen Kryptonite lock\";\r\nyou'll find a couple of really interesting stories about seemingly\r\nstrong security defeated by pretty basic technology.\r\n\r\nAnd when that happens, be sure to publish it on the Internet somewhere.\r\nSecrecy and security aren't the same, even though it may seem that way.\r\n Only bad security relies on secrecy; good security works even if all\r\nthe details of it are public.\r\n\r\nAnd publishing vulnerabilities forces security designers to design\r\nbetter security, and makes us all better consumers of security.  If you\r\nbuy a Kryptonite bike lock and it can be defeated with a Bic pen,\r\nyou're not getting very good security for your money.  And, likewise,\r\nif a bunch of smart kids can defeat the DHS's antiterrorist\r\ntechnologies, then it's not going to do a very good job against real\r\nterrorists.\r\n\r\nTrading privacy for security is stupid enough; not getting any actual\r\nsecurity in the bargain is even stupider.\r\n\r\nSo close the book and go.  The world is full of security systems.  Hack\r\none of them.\r\n\r\nBruce Schneier http://www.schneier.com\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nAfterword by Andrew \"bunnie\" Huang, Xbox Hacker\r\n\r\nHackers are explorers, digital pioneers. It's in a hacker's nature to\r\nquestion conventions and be tempted  by intricate problems. Any complex\r\nsystem is sport for a hacker; a side effect of this is the hacker's\r\nnatural affinity for problems involving security. Society is a large\r\nand complex system, and is certainly not off limits to a little\r\nhacking. As a result, hackers are often stereotyped as iconoclasts and\r\nsocial misfits, people who defy social norms for the sake of defiance.\r\nWhen I hacked the Xbox in 2002 while at MIT, I wasn’t doing it to rebel\r\nor to cause harm; I was just following a natural impulse, the same\r\nimpulse that leads to fixing a broken iPod or exploring the roofs and\r\ntunnels at MIT. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the combination of not complying with social norms and\r\nknowing “threatening” things like how to read the arphid on your credit\r\ncard or how to pick locks causes some people to fear hackers. However,\r\nthe motivations of a hacker are typically as simple as “I’m an engineer\r\nbecause I like to design things.” People often ask me, “Why did you\r\nhack the Xbox security system?” And my answer is simple: First, I own\r\nthe things that I buy. If someone can tell me what I can and can’t run\r\non my hardware, then I don’t own it. Second, because it’s there. It’s a\r\nsystem of sufficient complexity to make good sport. It was a great\r\ndiversion from the late nights working on my PhD.\r\n\r\nI was lucky. The fact that I was a graduate student at MIT when I\r\nhacked the Xbox legitimized the activity in the eyes of the right\r\npeople. However, the right to hack shouldn’t only be extended to\r\nacademics. I got my start on hacking when I was just a boy in\r\nelementary school, taking apart every electronic appliance I could get\r\nmy hands on, much to my parents’ chagrin. My reading collection\r\nincluded books on model rocketry, artillery, nuclear weaponry and\r\nexplosives manufacture -- books that I borrowed from my school library\r\n(I think the Cold War influenced the reading selection in public\r\nschools). I also played with my fair share of ad-hoc fireworks and\r\nroamed the open construction sites of houses being raised in my\r\nMidwestern neighborhood. While not the wisest of things to do, these\r\nwere important experiences in my coming of age and I grew up to be a\r\nfree thinker because of the social tolerance and trust of my community.\r\n\r\nCurrent events have not been so kind to aspiring hackers. Little\r\nBrother shows how we can get from where we are today to a world where\r\nsocial tolerance for new and different thoughts dies altogether. A\r\nrecent event highlights exactly how close we are to crossing the line\r\ninto the world of Little Brother. I had the fortune of reading an early\r\ndraft of Little Brother back in November 2006. Fast forward two months\r\nto the end of January 2007, when Boston police found suspected\r\nexplosive devices and shut down the city for a day. These devices\r\nturned out to be nothing more than circuit boards with flashing LEDs,\r\npromoting a show for the Cartoon Network. The artists who placed this\r\nurban graffiti were taken in as suspected terrorists and ultimately\r\ncharged with felony; the network producers had to shell out a $2\r\nmillion settlement, and the head of the Cartoon Network resigned over\r\nthe fallout. \r\n\r\nHave the terrorists already won? Have we given in to fear, such that\r\nartists, hobbyists, hackers, iconoclasts, or perhaps an unassuming\r\ngroup of kids playing Harajuku Fun Madness, could be so trivially\r\nimplicated as terrorists?\r\n\r\nThere is a term for this dysfunction -- it is called an autoimmune\r\ndisease, where an organism's defense system goes into overdrive so much\r\nthat it fails to recognize itself and attacks its own cells.\r\nUltimately, the organism self-destructs. Right now, America is on the\r\nverge of going into anaphylactic shock over its own freedoms, and we\r\nneed to inoculate ourselves against this. Technology is no cure for\r\nthis paranoia; in fact, it may enhance the paranoia: it turns us into\r\nprisoners of our own device. Coercing millions of people to strip off\r\ntheir outer garments and walk barefoot through metal detectors every\r\nday is no solution either. It only serves to remind the population\r\nevery day that they have a reason to be afraid, while in practice\r\nproviding only a flimsy barrier to a determined adversary.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that we can't count on someone else to make us feel free,\r\nand M1k3y won’t come and save us the day our freedoms are lost to\r\nparanoia. That's because M1k3y is in you and in me--Little Brother is a\r\nreminder that no matter how unpredictable the future may be, we don't\r\nwin freedom through security systems, cryptography, interrogations and\r\nspot searches. We win freedom by having the courage and the conviction\r\nto live every day freely and to act as a free society, no matter how\r\ngreat the threats are on the horizon.\r\n\r\nBe like M1k3y: step out the door and dare to be free.\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nBibliography\r\n\r\nNo writer creates from scratch -- we all engage in what Isaac Newton\r\ncalled \"standing on the shoulders of giants.\" We borrow, plunder and\r\nremix the art and culture created by those around us and by our\r\nliterary forebears.\r\n\r\nIf you liked this book and want to learn more, there are plenty of\r\nsources to turn to, online and at your local library or bookstore.\r\n\r\nHacking is a great subject. All science relies on telling other people\r\nwhat you've done so that they can verify it, learn from it, and improve\r\non it, and hacking is all about that process, so there's plenty\r\npublished on the subject.\r\n\r\nStart with Andrew \"Bunnie\" Huang's \"Hacking the Xbox,\" (No Starch\r\nPress, 2003) a wonderful book that tells the story of how Bunnie, then\r\na student at MIT, reverse-engineered the Xbox's anti-tampering\r\nmechanisms and opened the way for all the subsequent cool hacks for the\r\nplatform. In telling the story, Bunnie has also created a kind of Bible\r\nfor reverse engineering and hardware hacking.\r\n\r\nBruce Schneier's \"Secrets and Lies\" (Wiley, 2000) and \"Beyond Fear\"\r\n(Copernicus, 2003) are the definitive lay-person's texts on\r\nunderstanding security and thinking critically about it, while his\r\n\"Applied Cryptography\" (Wiley, 1995) remains the authoritative source\r\nfor understanding crypto. Bruce maintains an excellent blog and mailing\r\nlist at schneier.com/blog. Crypto and security are the realm of the\r\ntalented amateur, and the \"cypherpunk\" movement is full of kids,\r\nhome-makers, parents, lawyers, and every other stripe of person,\r\nhammering away on security protocols and ciphers.\r\n\r\nThere are several great magazines devoted to this subject, but the two\r\nbest ones are 2600: The Hacker Quarterly, which is full of\r\npseudonymous, boasting accounts of hacks accomplished, and O'Reilly's\r\nMAKE magazine, which features solid HOWTOs for making your own hardware\r\nprojects at home.\r\n\r\nThe online world overflows with material on this subject, of course. Ed\r\nFelten and Alex J Halderman's Freedom to Tinker\r\n(www.freedom-to-tinker.com) is a blog maintained by two fantastic\r\nPrinceton engineering profs who write lucidly about security,\r\nwiretapping, anti-copying technology and crypto.\r\n\r\nDon't miss Natalie Jeremijenko's \"Feral Robotics\" at UC San Diego\r\n(xdesign.ucsd.edu/feralrobots/). Natalie and her students rewire toy\r\nrobot dogs from Toys R Us and turn them into bad-ass toxic-waste\r\ndetectors. They unleash them on public parks where big corporations\r\nhave dumped their waste and demonstrate in media-friendly fashion how\r\ntoxic the ground is.\r\n\r\nLike many of the hacks in this book, the tunneling-over-DNS stuff is\r\nreal. Dan Kaminsky, a tunneling expert of the first water, published\r\ndetails in 2004 (www.doxpara.com/bo2004.ppt).\r\n\r\nThe guru of \"citizen journalism\" is Dan Gillmor, who is presently\r\nrunning Center for Citizen Media at Harvard and UC Berkeley -- he also\r\nwrote a hell of a book on the subject, \"We, the Media\" (O'Reilly,\r\n2004).\r\n\r\nIf you want to learn more about hacking arphids, start with Annalee\r\nNewitz's Wired Magazine article \"The RFID Hacking Underground\"\r\n(www.wirednews.com/wired/archive/14.05/rfid.html). Adam Greenfield's\r\n\"Everyware\" (New Riders Press, 2006) is a chilling look at the dangers\r\nof a world of arphids.\r\n\r\nNeal Gershenfeld's Fab Lab at MIT (fab.cba.mit.edu) is hacking out the\r\nworld's first real, cheap \"3D printers\" that can pump out any object\r\nyou can dream of. This is documented in Gershenfeld's excellent book on\r\nthe subject, \"Fab\" (Basic Books, 2005).\r\n\r\nBruce Sterling's \"Shaping Things\" (MIT Press, 2005) shows how arphids\r\nand fabs could be used to force companies to build products that don't\r\npoison the world.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Bruce Sterling, he wrote the first great book on hackers\r\nand the law, \"The Hacker Crackdown\" (Bantam, 1993), which is also the\r\nfirst book published by a major publisher that was released on the\r\nInternet at the same time (copies abound; see\r\nstuff.mit.edu/hacker/hacker.html for one). It was reading this book\r\nthat turned me on to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, where I was\r\nprivileged to work for four years.\r\n\r\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation (www.eff.org) is a charitable\r\nmembership organization with a student rate. They spend the money that\r\nprivate individuals give them to keep the Internet safe for personal\r\nliberty, free speech, due process, and the rest of the Bill of Rights.\r\nThey're the Internet's most effective freedom fighters, and you can\r\njoin the struggle just by signing up for their mailing list and writing\r\nto your elected officials when they're considering selling you out in\r\nthe name of fighting terrorism, piracy, the mafia, or whatever bogeyman\r\nhas caught their attention today. EFF also helps maintain TOR, The\r\nOnion Router, which is a real technology you can use *right now* to get\r\nout of your government, school or library's censoring firewall\r\n(tor.eff.org).\r\n\r\nEFF has a huge, deep website with amazing information aimed at a\r\ngeneral audience, as do the American Civil Liberties Union (aclu.org),\r\nPublic Knowledge (publicknowledge.org), FreeCulture (freeculture.org),\r\nCreative Commons (creativecommons.org) -- all of which also are worthy\r\nof your support. FreeCulture is an international student movement that\r\nactively recruits kids to found their own local chapters at their high\r\nschools and universities. It's a great way to get involved and make a\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nA lot of websites chronicle the fight for cyberliberties, but few go at\r\nit with the verve of Slashdot, \"News for Nerds, Stuff That Matters\"\r\n(slashdot.org).\r\n\r\nAnd of course, you *have to* visit Wikipedia, the collaborative,\r\nnet-authored encyclopedia that anyone can edit, with more than\r\n1,000,000 entries in English alone. Wikipedia covers hacking and\r\ncounterculture in astonishing depth and with amazing,\r\nup-to-the-nanosecond currency. One caution: you can't just look at the\r\nentries in Wikipedia. It's really important to look at the \"History\"\r\nand \"Discussion\" links at the top of every Wikipedia page to see how\r\nthe current version of the truth was arrived at, get an appreciation\r\nfor the competing points-of-view there, and decide for yourself whom\r\nyou trust.\r\n\r\nIf you want to get at some *real* forbidden knowledge, have a skim\r\naround Cryptome (cryptome.org), the world's most amazing archive of\r\nsecret, suppressed and liberated information. Cryptome's brave\r\npublishers collect material that's been pried out of the state by\r\nFreedom of Information Act requests or leaked by whistle-blowers and\r\npublishes it.\r\n\r\nThe best fictional account of the history of crypto is, hands-down,\r\nNeal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon (Avon, 2002). Stephenson tells the\r\nstory of Alan Turing and the Nazi Enigma Machine, turning it into a\r\ngripping war-novel that you won't be able to put down.\r\n\r\nThe Pirate Party mentioned in Little Brother is real and thriving in\r\nSweden (www.piratpartiet.se), Denmark, the USA and France at the time\r\nof this writing (July, 2006). They're a little out-there, but a\r\nmovement takes all kinds.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of out-there, Abbie Hoffman and the Yippies did indeed try to\r\nlevitate the Pentagon, throw money into the stock exchange, and work\r\nwith a group called the Up Against the Wall Motherf_____ers. Abbie\r\nHoffman's classic book on ripping off the system, \"Steal This Book,\" is\r\nback in print (Four Walls Eight Windows, 2002) and it's also online as\r\na collaborative wiki for people who want to try to update it\r\n(stealthiswiki.nine9pages.com).\r\n\r\nHoffman's autobiography, \"Soon to Be a Major Motion Picture\" (also in\r\nprint from Four Walls Eight Windows) is one of my favorite memoirs\r\never, even if it is highly fictionalized. Hoffman was an incredible\r\nstoryteller and had great activist instincts. If you want to know how\r\nhe really lived his life, though, try Larry Sloman's \"Steal This Dream\"\r\n(Doubleday, 1998).\r\n\r\nMore counterculture fun: Jack Kerouac's \"On the Road\" can be had in\r\npractically any used bookstore for a buck or two. Allan Ginsberg's\r\n\"HOWL\" is online in many places, and you can hear him read it if you\r\nsearch for the MP3 at archive.org. For bonus points, track down the\r\nalbum \"Tenderness Junction\" by the Fugs, which includes the audio of\r\nAllan Ginsberg and Abbie Hoffman's levitation ceremony at the Pentagon.\r\n\r\nThis book couldn't have been written if not for George Orwell's\r\nmagnificent, world-changing \"1984,\" the best novel ever published on\r\nhow societies go wrong. I read this book when I was 12 and have read it\r\n30 or 40 times since, and every time, I get something new out of it.\r\nOrwell was a master of storytelling and was clearly sick over the\r\ntotalitarian state that emerged in the Soviet Union. 1984 holds up\r\ntoday as a genuinely frightening work of science fiction, and it is one\r\nof the novels that literally changed the world. Today, \"Orwellian\" is\r\nsynonymous with a state of ubiquitous surveillance, doublethink, and\r\ntorture.\r\n\r\nMany novelists have tackled parts of the story in Little Brother.\r\nDaniel Pinkwater's towering comic masterpiece, \"Alan Mendelsohn: The\r\nBoy From Mars\" (presently in print as part of the omnibus \"5 Novels,\"\r\nFarrar, Straus and Giroux, 1997) is a book that every geek needs to\r\nread. If you've ever felt like an outcast for being too smart or weird,\r\nREAD THIS BOOK. It changed my life.\r\n\r\nOn a more contemporary front, there's Scott Westerfeld's \"So Yesterday\"\r\n(Razorbill, 2004), which follows the adventures of cool hunters and\r\ncounterculture jammers. Scott and his wife Justine Larbalestier were my\r\npartial inspiration to write a book for young adults -- as was Kathe\r\nKoja. Thanks, guys.\r\n\r\n&&&\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments\r\n\r\nThis book owes a tremendous debt to many writers, friends, mentors, and\r\nheroes who made it possible.\r\n\r\nFor the hackers and cypherpunks: Bunnie Huang, Seth Schoen, Ed Felten,\r\nAlex Halderman, Gweeds, Natalie Jeremijenko, Emmanuel Goldstein, Aaron\r\nSwartz\r\n\r\nFor the heroes: Mitch Kapor, John Gilmore, John Perry Barlow, Larry\r\nLessig, Shari Steele, Cindy Cohn, Fred von Lohmann, Jamie Boyle, George\r\nOrwell, Abbie Hoffman, Joe Trippi, Bruce Schneier, Ross Dowson, Harry\r\nKopyto, Tim O'Reilly\r\n\r\nFor the writers: Bruce Sterling, Kathe Koja, Scott Westerfeld, Justine\r\nLarbalestier, Pat York, Annalee Newitz, Dan Gillmor, Daniel Pinkwater,\r\nKevin Pouslen, Wendy Grossman, Jay Lake, Ben Rosenbaum\r\n\r\nFor the friends: Fiona Romeo, Quinn Norton, Danny O'Brien, Jon Gilbert,\r\ndanah boyd, Zak Hanna, Emily Hurson, Grad Conn, John Henson, Amanda\r\nFoubister, Xeni Jardin, Mark Frauenfelder, David Pescovitz, John\r\nBattelle, Karl Levesque, Kate Miles, Neil and Tara-Lee Doctorow, Rael\r\nDornfest, Ken Snider\r\n\r\nFor the mentors: Judy Merril, Roz and Gord Doctorow, Harriet Wolff, Jim\r\nKelly, Damon Knight, Scott Edelman\r\n\r\nThank you all for giving me the tools to think and write about these\r\nideas.\r\n\r\n&&&$\r\n\r\nCreative Commons\r\n\r\nCreative Commons Legal Code\r\n\r\nAttribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported\r\n\r\n    CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE\r\n    LEGAL SERVICES.

TO THE EXTENT THIS\r\nLICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE\r\nRIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS\r\nAND CONDITIONS.\r\n\r\n1. Definitions\r\n\r\n   1. \"Adaptation\" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work\r\n   and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,\r\n   derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a\r\n   literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes\r\n   cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may\r\n   be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form\r\n   recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that\r\n   constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for\r\n   the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the\r\n   Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the\r\n   synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image\r\n   (\"synching\") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of\r\n   this License.\r\n\r\n   2. \"Collection\" means a collection of literary or artistic works,\r\n   such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms\r\n   or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works\r\n   listed in Section 1(g) below, which, by reason of the selection and\r\n   arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in\r\n   which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along\r\n   with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and\r\n   independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a\r\n   collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be\r\n   considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this\r\n   License.\r\n\r\n   3. \"Distribute\" means to make available to the public the original\r\n   and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale\r\n   or other transfer of ownership.\r\n\r\n   4. \"License Elements\" means the following high-level license\r\n   attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of\r\n   this License: Attribution, Noncommercial, ShareAlike.\r\n\r\n   5. \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities\r\n   that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n   6. \"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary or artistic\r\n   work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created\r\n   the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the\r\n   publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the\r\n   actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act,\r\n   sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform\r\n   literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the\r\n   case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity\r\n   who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,\r\n   (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the\r\n   broadcast.\r\n\r\n   7. \"Work\" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the\r\n   terms of this License including without limitation any production in\r\n   the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the\r\n   mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a\r\n   book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or\r\n   other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work;\r\n   a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical\r\n   composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which\r\n   are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to\r\n   cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture,\r\n   sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which\r\n   are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to\r\n   photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan,\r\n   sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,\r\n   architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a\r\n   compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable\r\n   work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the\r\n   extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.\r\n\r\n   8. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this\r\n   License who has not previously violated the terms of this License\r\n   with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission\r\n   from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a\r\n   previous violation.\r\n\r\n   9. \"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the\r\n   Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by\r\n   any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public\r\n   digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such\r\n   a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place\r\n   and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to\r\n   the public by any means or process and the communication to the\r\n   public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital\r\n   performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means\r\n   including signs, sounds or images.\r\n\r\n  10. \"Reproduce\" means to make copies of the Work by any means\r\n  including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the\r\n  right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including\r\n  storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or\r\n  other electronic medium.\r\n\r\n2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,\r\nlimit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from\r\nlimitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the\r\ncopyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\r\n\r\n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,\r\nLicensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,\r\nperpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to\r\nexercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\r\n\r\n   1. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more\r\n   Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the\r\n   Collections;\r\n\r\n   2. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such\r\n   Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes\r\n   reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify\r\n   that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a\r\n   translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from\r\n   English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original\r\n   work has been modified.\";\r\n\r\n   3. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as\r\n   incorporated in Collections; and,\r\n\r\n   4. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\r\n\r\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now\r\nknown or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make\r\nsuch modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights\r\nin other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not\r\nexpressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not\r\nlimited to the rights described in Section 4(e).\r\n\r\n4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly\r\nmade subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\r\n\r\n   1. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the\r\n   terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform\r\n   Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the\r\n   Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose\r\n   any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the\r\n   ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted\r\n   to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not\r\n   sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to\r\n   this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of\r\n   the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or\r\n   Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective\r\n   technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a\r\n   recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to\r\n   that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)\r\n   applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does\r\n   not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made\r\n   subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,\r\n   upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,\r\n   remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(d),\r\n   as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any\r\n   Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the\r\n   Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested.\r\n\r\n   2. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under:\r\n   (i) the terms of this License; (ii) a later version of this License\r\n   with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative\r\n   Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license\r\n   version) that contains the same License Elements as this License\r\n   (e.g., Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) (\"Applicable\r\n   License\"). You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable\r\n   License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or\r\n   Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the\r\n   Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the\r\n   ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights\r\n   granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License.\r\n   You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable\r\n   License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the\r\n   Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly\r\n   Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You\r\n   may not impose any effective technological measures on the\r\n   Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the\r\n   Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient\r\n   under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies\r\n   to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not\r\n   require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made\r\n   subject to the terms of the Applicable License.\r\n\r\n   3. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section\r\n   3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed\r\n   toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The\r\n   exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital\r\n   file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for\r\n   or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary\r\n   compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary\r\n   compensation in con-nection with the exchange of copyrighted works.\r\n\r\n   4. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any\r\n   Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made\r\n   pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the\r\n   Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are\r\n   utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if\r\n   applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or\r\n   Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor\r\n   institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution\r\n   Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by\r\n   other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the\r\n   title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably\r\n   practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be\r\n   associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the\r\n   copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv)\r\n   consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit\r\n   identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French\r\n   translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on\r\n   original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this\r\n   Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,\r\n   however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a\r\n   minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing\r\n   authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of\r\n   these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits\r\n   for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You\r\n   may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of\r\n   attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your\r\n   rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly\r\n   assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by\r\n   the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as\r\n   appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,\r\n   express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor\r\n   and/or Attribution Parties.\r\n\r\n   5. For the avoidance of doubt:\r\n\r\n         1. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those\r\n         jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through\r\n         any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived,\r\n         the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such\r\n         royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under\r\n         this License;\r\n\r\n         2. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions\r\n         in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory\r\n         or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor\r\n         reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any\r\n         exercise by You of the rights granted under this License if\r\n         Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or use which is\r\n         otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c)\r\n         and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through\r\n         any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,\r\n\r\n         3. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right\r\n         to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event\r\n         that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that\r\n         administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society,\r\n         from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this\r\n         License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than\r\n         noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).\r\n\r\n   6. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may\r\n   be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce,\r\n   Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part\r\n   of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate,\r\n   modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which\r\n   would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.\r\n   Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which\r\n   any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License\r\n   (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,\r\n   mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to\r\n   the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive\r\n   or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent\r\n   permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to\r\n   reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License\r\n   (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\r\n\r\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\r\n\r\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO\r\nTHE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE\r\nWORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND\r\nCONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,\r\nINCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF\r\nLATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF\r\nERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW\r\nTHE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO\r\nYOU.\r\n\r\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE\r\nLAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR\r\nANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES\r\nARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR\r\nHAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n7. Termination\r\n\r\n   1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\r\n   automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.\r\n   Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections\r\n   from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses\r\n   terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full\r\n   compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will\r\n   survive any termination of this License.\r\n\r\n   2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted\r\n   here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in\r\n   the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to\r\n   release the Work under different license terms or to stop\r\n   distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such\r\n   election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other\r\n   license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms\r\n   of this License), and this License will continue in full force and\r\n   effect unless terminated as stated above.\r\n\r\n8. Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n   1. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a\r\n   Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the\r\n   Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You\r\n   under this License.\r\n\r\n   2. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,\r\n   Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on\r\n   the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under\r\n   this License.\r\n\r\n   3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable\r\n   under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or\r\n   enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and\r\n   without further action by the parties to this agreement, such\r\n   provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make\r\n   such provision valid and enforceable.\r\n\r\n   4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and\r\n   no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in\r\n   writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or\r\n   consent.\r\n\r\n   5. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties\r\n   with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,\r\n   agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified\r\n   here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that\r\n   may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be\r\n   modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and\r\n   You.\r\n\r\n   6. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in\r\n   this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne\r\n   Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as\r\n   amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the\r\n   WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms\r\n   Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on\r\n   July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the\r\n   relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be\r\n   enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the\r\n   implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national\r\n   law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable\r\n   copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this\r\n   License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the\r\n   License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any\r\n   rights under applicable law.\r\n\r\n    Creative Commons Notice\r\n\r\n    Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no\r\n    warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work.
