At all events, the\r\nauthor has found this diversion in his favorite field mentally\r\nagreeable and refreshing.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with some of the alleged men who now are cursing this\r\nearth by their baneful presence, the so-called \"lower animals\" do not\r\nseem so very \"low\" after all! As a friend of the animals, this is a\r\nvery proper time in which to compare them with men. Furthermore, if\r\nthinking men and women desire to know the leading facts concerning the\r\nintelligence of wild animals, it will be well to consider them now,\r\nbefore the bravest and the best of the wild creatures of the earth go\r\ndown and out under the merciless and inexorable steam roller that we\r\ncall Civilization.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence and the ways of wild animals are large subjects.\r\nConcerning them I do not offer this volume as an all-in-all production.\r\nOut of the great mass of interesting things that might\r\nhave been included, I have endeavored to select and set forth only\r\nenough to make a good series of sample exhibits, without involving the\r\ngeneral reader in a hopelessly large collection of details. The most\r\nserious question has been: What shall be left out?\r\n\r\nMr. A. R. Spofford, first Librarian of Congress, used to declare that\r\n\"Books are made from books\"; but I call the reader to bear witness that\r\nthis volume is not a mass of quotations. A quoted authority often can\r\nbe disputed, and for this reason the author has found considerable\r\nsatisfaction in relying chiefly upon his own testimony.\r\n\r\nBecause I always desire to know the _opinions_ of men who are\r\nwriting upon their own observations, I have felt free to express my own\r\nconclusions regarding the many phases of animal intelligence as their\r\nmanifestation has impressed me in close-up observations.\r\n\r\nI have purposely avoided all temptations to discuss the minds and\r\nmanners of domestic animals, partly because that is by itself a large\r\nsubject, and partly because their minds have been so greatly influenced\r\nby long and close association with man. The domestic mammals and birds\r\ndeserve independent treatment.\r\n\r\nA great many stories of occurrences have been written into this\r\nvolume, for the purpose of giving the reader all the facts in\r\norder that he may form his own opinions of the animal mentality\r\ndisplayed.\r\n\r\nMost sincerely do I wish that the boys and girls of America, and of the\r\nwhole world, may be induced to believe that _the most interesting\r\nthing about a wild animal is its mind and its reasoning,_ and that a\r\ndead animal is only a poor decaying thing. If the feet of the young men\r\nwould run more to seeing and studying the wild creatures and less to\r\nthe killing of them, some of the world's valuable species might escape\r\nbeing swept away tomorrow, or the day after.\r\n\r\nThe author gratefully acknowledges his indebtedness to Munsey's\r\nMagazine, McClure's Magazine and the Sunday Magazine Syndicate for\r\npermission to copy herein various portions of his chapters from those\r\npublications.\r\n\r\nW.

They\r\nhave their wisdom and their folly, their joys and their sorrows,\r\ntheir trials and tribulations.\r\n\r\nAs the alleged lord of creation, it is man's duty to know the wild\r\nanimals truly as they are, in order to enjoy them to the utmost, to\r\nutilize them sensibly and fairly, and to give them a square deal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. A SURVEY OF THE FIELD\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE LAY OF THE LAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a vast field of fascinating human interest, lying only just\r\noutside our doors, which as yet has been but little explored. It is the\r\nField of Animal Intelligence.\r\n\r\nOf all the kinds of interest attaching to the study of the world's\r\nwild animals, there are none that surpass the study of their minds,\r\ntheir morals, and the acts that they perform as the results of their\r\nmental processes.\r\n\r\nIn these pages, the term \"animal\" is not used in its most common\r\nand most restricted sense. It is intended to apply not only to\r\nquadrupeds, but also to all the vertebrate forms,--mammals,\r\nbirds, reptiles, amphibians and fishes.\r\n\r\nFor observation and study, the whole vast world of living\r\ncreatures is ours, throughout all zones and all lands. It is not\r\nours to flout, to abuse, or to exterminate as we please. While for\r\npractical reasons we do not here address ourselves to the\r\ninvertebrates, nor even to the sea-rovers, we can not keep them\r\nout of the background of our thoughts. The living world is so vast\r\nand so varied, so beautiful and so ugly, so delightful and so\r\nterrible, so interesting and so commonplace, that each step we\r\nmake through it reveals things different and previously unknown.\r\n\r\nThe Frame of Mind. To the inquirer who enters the field of animal\r\nthought with an open mind, and free from the trammels of egotism\r\nand fear regarding man's place in nature, this study will prove an\r\nendless succession of surprises and delights. In behalf of the\r\nutmost tale of results, the inquirer should summon to his aid his\r\nrules of evidence, his common sense, his love of fair play, and\r\nthe inexorable logic of his youthful geometry.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us clear away a few weeds from the entrance to our\r\nfield, and reveal its cornerstones and boundary lines. To a\r\ncorrect understanding of any subject a correct point of view is\r\nabsolutely essential.\r\n\r\nIn a commonplace and desultory way man has been mildly interested\r\nin the intelligence of animals for at least 30,000 years. The Cro-\r\nMagnons of that far time possessed real artistic talent, and on\r\nthe smooth stone walls and ceilings of the caves of France they\r\ndrew many wonderful pictures of mammoths, European bison, wild\r\ncattle, rhinoceroses and other animals of their period. Ever since\r\nman took unto himself certain tractable wild animals, and made\r\nperpetual thralls of the horse, the dog, the cat, the cattle,\r\nsheep, goats and swine, he has noted their intelligent ways. Ever\r\nsince the first caveman began to hunt wild beasts and slay them\r\nwith clubs and stones, the two warring forces have been interested\r\nin each other, but for about 25,000 years I think that the wild\r\nbeasts knew about as much of man's intelligence as men knew of\r\ntheirs.\r\n\r\nI leave to those who are interested in history the task of\r\nrevealing the date, or the period, when scholarly men first began\r\nto pay serious attention to the animal mind.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 when Mr. George J. Romanes, of London, published his\r\nexcellent work on \"Animal Intelligence,\" on one of its first pages\r\nhe blithely brushed aside as of little account all the\r\nobservations, articles and papers on his subject that had been\r\npublished previous to that time. Now mark how swiftly history can\r\nrepeat itself, and also bring retribution.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 there arose in the United States of America a group of\r\nprofessional college-and-university animal psychologists who set\r\nup the study of \"animal behavior.\" They did this so seriously, and\r\nso determinedly, that one of the first acts of two of them\r\nconsisted in joyously brushing aside as of no account whatever,\r\nand quite beneath serious consideration, everything that had been\r\nseen, done and said previous to the rise of their group, and the\r\nlaboratory Problem Box. In view of what this group has\r\naccomplished since 1910, with their \"problem boxes,\" their \"mazes\"\r\nand their millions of \"trials by error,\" expressed in solid pages\r\nof figures, the world of animal lovers is entitled to smile\r\ntolerantly upon the cheerful assumptions of ten years ago.\r\n\r\nBut let it not at any time be assumed that we are destitute of\r\nproblem boxes; for the author has two of his own! One is called\r\nthe Great Outdoors, and the other is named the New York Zoological\r\nPark. The first has been in use sixty years, the latter twenty-two\r\nyears. Both are today in good working order, but the former is not\r\nquite as good as new.\r\n\r\nA Preachment to the Student. In studying the wild-animal mind,\r\nthe boundary line between Reality and Dreamland is mighty easy to\r\ncross. He who easily yields to seductive reasoning, and the call\r\nof the wild imagination, soon will become a dreamer of dreams and\r\na seer of visions of things that never occurred. The temptation to\r\nplace upon the simple acts of animals the most complex and far-\r\nfetched interpretations is a trap ever ready for the feet of the\r\nunwary. It is better to see nothing than to see a lot of things\r\nthat are not true.\r\n\r\nIn the study of animals, we have long insisted that _to the open\r\neye and the thinking brain, truth is stranger than fiction._\r\nBut Truth does not always wear her heart upon her sleeve for\r\nzanies to peck at. Unfortunately there are millions of men who go\r\nthrough the world looking at animals, but not seeing them.\r\n\r\nBeware of setting up for wild animals impossible mental and moral\r\nstandards. The student must not deceive himself by overestimating\r\nmental values. If an estimate must be made, make it under the mark\r\nof truth rather than above it. While avoiding the folly of\r\nidealism, we also must shun the ways of the narrow mind, and the\r\neyes that refuse to see the truth. Wild animals are not superhuman\r\ndemigods of wisdom; but neither are they idiots, unable to reason\r\nfrom cause to effect along the simple lines that vitally affect\r\ntheir existence.\r\n\r\nBrain-owning wild animals are not mere machines of flesh and\r\nblood, set agoing by the accident of birth, and running for life\r\non the narrow-gauge railway of Heredity. They are not \"Machines in\r\nFur and Feathers,\" as one naturalist once tried to make the world\r\nbelieve them to be. Some animals have more intelligence than some\r\nmen; and some have far better morals.\r\n\r\nWhat Constitutes Evidence. The best evidence regarding the ways of\r\nwild animals is one's own eye-witness testimony. Not all second-\r\nhand observations are entirely accurate. Many persons do not know\r\nhow to observe; and at times some are deceived by their own eyes\r\nor ears. It is a sad fact that both those organs are easily\r\ndeceived. The student who is in doubt regarding the composition of\r\nevidence will do well to spend a few days in court listening to\r\nthe trial of an important and hotly contested case. In collecting\r\nreal evidence, all is not gold that glitters.\r\n\r\nMany a mind misinterprets the thing seen, sometimes innocently,\r\nand again wantonly. The nature fakir is always on the alert to see\r\nwonderful phenomena in wild life, about which to write; and by\r\npreference he places the most strained and marvellous\r\ninterpretation upon the animal act. Beware of the man who always\r\nsees marvellous things in animals, for he is a dangerous guide.\r\nThere is one man who claims to have seen in his few days in the\r\nwoods more wonders than all the older American naturalists and\r\nsportsmen have seen added together.\r\n\r\nNow, Nature does not assemble all her wonderful phenomena and hold\r\nthem in leash to be turned loose precisely when the great Observer\r\nof Wonders spends his day in the woods. Wise men always suspect\r\nthe man who sees too many marvelous things.\r\n\r\nThe Relative Value of Witnesses. It is due that a word should be\r\nsaid regarding \"expert testimony\" in the case of the wild animal.\r\nSome dust has been raised in this field by men posing as\r\nauthorities on wild animal psychology, whose observations of the\r\nworld's wild animals have been confined to the chipmunks,\r\nsquirrels, weasels, foxes, rabbits, and birds dwelling within a\r\nsmall circle surrounding some particular woodland house. In\r\nanother class other men have devoted heavy scientific labors to\r\nlaboratory observations on white rats, domestic rabbits, cats,\r\ndogs, sparrows, turtles and newts as the handpicked exponents of\r\nthe intelligence of the animals of the world!\r\n\r\nAlas! for the human sense of Proportion!\r\n\r\nFancy an ethnologist studying the Eskimo, the Dog-Rib Indian, the\r\nBushman, the Aino and the Papuan, and then proceeding to write\r\nconclusively \"On the Intelligence of the Human Race.\"\r\n\r\nThe proper place in which to study the minds, manners and morals\r\nof wild animals is in the most thickly populated haunts of the\r\nmost intelligent species. The free and untrammeled animal, busily\r\nworking out its own destiny unhindered by man, is the beau-ideal\r\nanimal to observe and to study. Go to the plain, the wilderness,\r\nthe desert and the mountain, not merely to shoot everything on\r\nfoot, but to SEE _animals at home,_ and there use your eyes\r\nand your field-glass. See what _normal wild animals_ do as\r\n\"behavior,\" and then try to find out why they do it.\r\n\r\nThe next best place for study purposes is a spacious, sanitary and\r\nwell-stocked zoological park, wherein are assembled great\r\ncollections of the most interesting land vertebrates that can be\r\nprocured, from all over the earth. There the student can observe\r\nmany new traits of wild animal character, as they are brought to\r\nthe surface by captivity. There will some individuals reveal the\r\nworst traits of their species. Others will reveal marvels in\r\nmentality, and teach lessons such as no man can learn from them in\r\nthe open. To study temperament, there is no place like a zoo.\r\n\r\nEven there, however, the wisest course,--as it seems to me,--is\r\nnot to introduce too many appliances as aids to mental activity,\r\nbut rather to see what the animal subject thinks and does _by\r\nits own initiative._ In the testing of memory and the\r\nperceptive faculties, training for performances is the best method\r\nto pursue.\r\n\r\nThe reader has a right to know that the author of this volume has\r\nenjoyed unparalleled opportunities for the observation and study\r\nof highly intelligent wild animals, both in their wild haunts and\r\nin a great vivarium; and these combined opportunities have covered\r\na long series of years.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding farther, it is desirable to define certain terms\r\nthat frequently will be used in these pages.\r\n\r\nTHE ANIMAL BRAIN is the generator of the mind, and the clearing-\r\nhouse of the senses. As a mechanism, the brain of man is the most\r\nperfect, and in the descent through the mammals, birds, reptiles,\r\namphibians and fishes, the brain progressively is simplified in\r\nform and function.\r\n\r\nTHOUGHT is the result of the various processes of the brain and\r\nnervous system, stimulated by the contributions of the senses.\r\n\r\nSANITY is the state of normal, orderly and balanced thought, as\r\nformulated by a healthy brain.\r\n\r\nINSANITY is a state of mental disease, resulting in disordered,\r\nunbalanced and chaotic thought, destitute of reason.\r\n\r\nREASON is the manifestation of correct observation and healthful\r\nthought which recognizes both cause and effect, and leads from\r\npremise to conclusion. INTELLIGENCE is created by the possession\r\nof knowledge either inherited or acquired. It may be either latent\r\nor active; and it is the forerunner of reason.\r\n\r\nINSTINCT is the knowledge or impulse which animals or men derive\r\nfrom their ancestors by inheritance, and which they obey, either\r\nconsciously or subconsciously in working out their own\r\npreservation, increase and betterment. Instinct often functions as\r\na sixth sense.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION is the acquirement of knowledge by precept or by\r\nobservation; but animals as well as men may be self-taught, and\r\nbecome self-educated, by the diligent exercise of the observing\r\nand reasoning faculties. The adjustment of a wild animal mind to\r\nconditions unknown to its ancestors is through the process of\r\nself-education, and by logical reasoning from premise to\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nThe wild animal must think, or die.\r\n\r\nAnimal intelligence varies in quantity and quality as much as\r\nanimals vary in size. Idiots, maniacs and sleeping persons are the\r\nonly classes of human beings who are devoid of intelligence and\r\nreasoning power. Idiots and maniacs also are often devoid of the\r\ncommon animal _instinct_ that ordinarily promotes self-\r\npreservation from fire, water and high places. A heavily sleeping\r\nperson is often so sodden in slumber that his senses of smell and\r\nhearing are temporarily dead; and many a sleeping man has been\r\nasphyxiated by gas or smoke, or burned to death, because his\r\ndeadened senses failed to arouse him at the critical moment. (This\r\ndangerous condition of mind can be cured by efforts of the will,\r\nexercised prior to sleep, through a determination resolutely to\r\narouse and investigate every unusual sensation that registers\r\n\"danger\" on any one of the senses.) The normal individual sleeps\r\nwith a subconscious and sensitive mind, from which thought and\r\nreason have not been entirely eliminated.\r\n\r\nEvery act of a man or animal, vertebrate or invertebrate, is based\r\nupon either _reason_ or _hereditary instinct._ It is a\r\nmistake to assume that because an organism is small it\r\nnecessarily has no \"mind,\" and none of the propelling impulse that\r\nwe call thought. The largest whale may have less intelligence and\r\nconstructive reasoning than a trap-door spider, a bee or an ant.\r\nTo deny this is to deny the evidence of one's senses.\r\n\r\nA MEASURE FOR ANIMAL INTELLIGENCE. The intelligence of an animal\r\nmay be estimated by taking into account, separately, its mental\r\nqualities, about as follows:\r\n\r\n1. General knowledge of surrounding conditions.\r\n2. Powers of independent observation and reasoning.\r\n3. Memory.\r\n4. Comprehension under tuition.\r\n5. Accuracy in the execution of man's orders.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to these are the _moral qualities_ which go to\r\nmake up an animal's temperament and disposition, about as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Amiability, which guarantees security to its associates.\r\n2. Patience, or submission to discipline and training.\r\n3. Courage, which gives self-confidence and steadiness.\r\n4. A disposition to obedience, with cheerfulness.\r\n\r\nAll normal vertebrate animals exercise their intelligence in\r\naccordance with their own rules of logic. Had they not been able\r\nto do so, it is reasonable to suppose that they could never have\r\ndeveloped into vertebrates, reaching even up to man himself.\r\n\r\nAccording to the laws of logic, this proposition is no more open\r\nto doubt or dispute than is the existence of the Grand Canyon of\r\nthe Colorado. But few persons have seen the Canyon, and far fewer\r\never have proven its existence by descending to its bottom; but\r\nnone the less Reason admonishes all of us that the great chasm\r\nexists, and is not a debatable question.\r\n\r\nTo men and women who really know the vertebrate animals by contact\r\nwith some of them upon their own levels, the reasoning power of\r\nthe latter is not a debatable question. The only real question is:\r\nhow far does their intelligence carry them? It is with puzzled\r\nsurprise that we have noted the curious diligence of the\r\nprofessors of animal psychology in always writing of \"animal\r\n_behavior_,\" and never of old-fashioned, common-sense\r\n_animal intelligence_. Can it be possible that any one of\r\nthem really refuses to concede to the wild animal the possession\r\nof a mind, and a working intelligence?\r\n\r\nYes. Animals do reason. If any one truth has come out of all the\r\ncritical or uncritical study of the animal mind that has been\r\ngoing on for two centuries, it is this. Animals do reason; they\r\nalways have reasoned, and as long as animals live they never will\r\ncease to reason.\r\n\r\nThe higher wild animals possess and display the same fundamental\r\npassions and emotions that animate the human race. This fact is\r\nsubject to intelligent analysis, discussion and development, but\r\nit is not by any means a \"question\" subject to debate. In the most\r\nintellectual of the quadrupeds, birds and reptiles, the display of\r\nfear, courage, love, hate, pleasure, displeasure, confidence,\r\nsuspicion, jealousy, pity, greed and generosity are so plainly\r\nevident that even children can and do recognize them. To the\r\nserious and open-minded student who devotes prolonged thought to\r\nthese things, they bring the wild animal very near to the \"lord of\r\ncreation.\"\r\n\r\nTo the question, \"Have wild animals souls?\" we reply, \"That is a\r\ndebatable question. Read; then think it over.\"\r\n\r\nMETHODS WITH THE ANIMAL MIND. In the study of animal minds, much\r\ndepends upon the method employed. It seems to me that the problem-\r\nbox method of the investigators of \"animal behavior\" leaves much\r\nto be desired. Certainly it is not calculated to develop the\r\nmental status of animals along lines of natural mental\r\nprogression. To place a wild creature in a great artificial\r\ncontrivance, fitted with doors, cords, levers, passages and what\r\nnot, is enough to daze or frighten any timid animal out of its\r\nnormal state of mind and nerves. To put a wild sapajou monkey,--\r\nweak, timid and afraid,--in a strange and formidable prison box\r\nfilled with strange machinery, and call upon it to learn or to\r\ninvent strange mechanical processes, is like bringing a boy of ten\r\nyears up to a four-cylinder duplex Hoe printing-and-folding press,\r\nand saying to him: \"Now, go ahead and find out how to run this\r\nmachine, and print both sides of a signature upon it.\"\r\n\r\nThe average boy would shrink from the mechanical monster, and have\r\nno stomach whatever for \"trial by error.\"\r\n\r\nI think that the principle of determining the mind of a wild\r\nanimal _along the lines of the professor_ is not the best\r\nway. It should be developed _along the natural lines of the\r\nwild-animal mind._ It should be stimulated to do what it feels\r\nmost inclined to do, and educated to achieve real mental progress.\r\n\r\nI think that the ideal way to study the minds of apes, baboons and\r\nmonkeys would be to choose a good location in a tropical or sub-\r\ntropical climate that is neither too wet nor too dry, enclose an\r\narea of five acres with an unclimbable fence, and divide it into\r\nas many corrals as there are species to be experimented upon. Each\r\ncorral would need a shelter house and indoor playroom. The stage\r\nproperties should be varied and abundant, and designed to\r\nstimulate curiosity as well as activity.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in the program I would try to teach orang-utans and\r\nchimpanzees the properties of fire, and how to make and tend\r\nfires. I would try to teach them the seed-planting idea, and the\r\nmeaning of seedtime and harvest. I would teach sanitation and\r\ncleanliness of habit,--a thing much more easily done than most\r\npersons suppose. I would teach my apes to wash dishes and to cook,\r\nand I am sure that some of them would do no worse than some human\r\nmembers of the profession who now receive $50 per month, or more,\r\nfor spoiling food.\r\n\r\nIn one corral I would mix up a chimpanzee, an orang-utan, a golden\r\nbaboon and a good-tempered rhesus monkey. My apes would begin at\r\ntwo years old, because after seven or eight years of age all apes\r\nare difficult, or even impossible, as subjects for peaceful\r\nexperimentation.\r\n\r\nI would try to teach a chimpanzee the difference between a noise\r\nand music, between heat and cold, between good food and bad food.\r\nAny trainer can teach an animal the difference between the\r\nblessings of peace and the horrors of war, or in other words,\r\nobedience and good temper versus cussedness and punishment.\r\n\r\nDr. Yerkes' laboratory in Montecito, California, and his\r\nexperiments there with an orang-utan and other primates, were in a\r\ngood place, and made a good beginning. It is very much to be hoped\r\nthat means will be provided by which his work can be prosecuted\r\nindefinitely, and under the most perfect conditions that money can\r\nprovide.\r\n\r\nI hope that I will live long enough to see Dr. Yerkes develop the\r\nmind of a young grizzly bear in a four-acre lot, to the utmost\r\nlimits of that keen and sagacious personality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWILD ANIMAL TEMPERAMENT AND INDIVIDUALITY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn man and in vertebrate animals generally, temperament is the\r\nfoundation of intelligence and progress. Fifty years ago Fowler\r\nand Wells, the founders of the science of phrenology and\r\nphysiognomy, very wisely differentiated and defined four\r\n\"temperaments\" of mankind. The six types now recognized by me are\r\nthe _morose, lymphatic, sanguine, nervous, hysterical_ and\r\n_combative_; and their names adequately describe them.\r\n\r\nThis classification applies to the higher wild animals, quite as\r\ntruly as to men. By the manager of wild animals in captivity,\r\nwild-animal temperament universally is recognized and treated as a\r\nfactor of great practical importance. Mistakes in judging the\r\ntemper of dangerous animals easily lead to tragedies and sudden\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nFundamentally the temperament of a man or an animal is an\r\ninheritance from ancestors near or remote. In the human species a\r\nmorose or hysterical temperament may possibly be corrected or\r\nimproved, by education and effort. With animals this is rarely\r\npossible. The morose gorilla gives way to cheerfulness only when\r\nit is placed in ideally pleasant and stimulating social\r\nconditions. This, however, very seldom is possible. The nervous\r\ndeer, bear or monkey is usually nervous to the end of its days.\r\n\r\nThe morose and hysterical temperaments operate against mental\r\ndevelopment, progress and happiness. In the human species among\r\nindividuals of equal mental calibre, the sanguine individual is\r\ndue to rise higher and go farther than his nervous or lymphatic\r\nrivals. A characteristic temperament may embrace the majority of\r\na whole species, or be limited to a few individuals. Many species\r\nare permanently characterized by the temperament common to the\r\nmajority of their individual members. Thus, among the great apes\r\nthe gorilla species is either morose or lymphatic; and it is\r\nmanifested by persistent inactivity and sullenness. This leads to\r\nloss of appetite, indigestion, inactivity and early death. Major\r\nPenny's \"John Gorilla\" was a notable exception, as will appear in\r\nChapter IX.\r\n\r\nThe orang-utan is sanguine, optimistic and cheerful, a good\r\nboarder, affectionate toward his keepers, and friendly toward\r\nstrangers. He eats well, enjoys life, lives long, and is well\r\nliked by everybody.\r\n\r\nExcept when quite young, the chimpanzee is either nervous or\r\nhysterical. After six years of age it is irritable and difficult\r\nto manage. After seven years of age (puberty) it is rough,\r\ndomineering and dangerous. The male is given to shouting, yelling,\r\nshrieking and roaring, and when quite angry rages like a demon. I\r\nknow of no wild animal that is more dangerous per pound than a\r\nmale chimpanzee over eight years of age. When young they do\r\nwonders in trained performances, but when they reach maturity,\r\ngrow big of arm and shoulder, and masterfully strong, they quickly\r\nbecome conscious of their strength. It is then that performing\r\nchimpanzees become unruly, fly into sudden fits of temper, their\r\nback hair bristles up, they stamp violently, and sometimes leap\r\ninto a terrorized orchestra. Next in order, they are retired\r\nwilly-nilly from the stage, and are offered for sale to zoological\r\nparks and gardens having facilities for confinement and control.\r\n\r\nThe baboons are characteristically fierce and aggressive, and in a\r\nwild state they live in troops, or even in herds of hundreds.\r\nBeing armed with powerful canine teeth and wolf-like jaws, they\r\nare formidable antagonists, and other animals do not dare to\r\nattack them. It is because of their natural weapons, their\r\nreadiness to fight like fiends, and their combined agility and\r\nstrength that the baboons have been able to live on the ground and\r\nsurvive and flourish in lands literally reeking with lions,\r\nleopards, hyenas and wild dogs. The awful canine teeth of an old\r\nmale baboon are quite as dangerous as those of any leopard, and\r\neven the leopard's onslaught is less to be feared than the wild\r\nrage of an adult baboon. In the Transvaal and Rhodesia, it is a\r\ncommon occurrence for an ambitious dog to go after a troop of\r\nbaboons and never return.\r\n\r\nTemperamentally the commoner groups of monkeys are thus\r\ncharacterized:\r\n\r\nThe rhesus monkeys of India are nervous, irritable and dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe green monkeys of Africa are sanguine, but savage and\r\ntreacherous.\r\n\r\nThe langur monkeys of India are sanguine and peace-loving.\r\n\r\nThe macaques of the Far East vary from the sanguine temperament to\r\nthe combative.\r\n\r\nThe gibbons vary from sanguine to combative.\r\n\r\nThe lemurs of Madagascar are sanguine, affectionate and peaceful.\r\n\r\nNearly all South American monkeys are sanguine, and peace-loving,\r\nand many are affectionate.\r\n\r\nThe species of the group of Carnivora are too numerous and too\r\ndiversified to be treated with any approach to completeness.\r\nHowever, to illustrate this subject the leading species will be\r\nnoticed.\r\n\r\nTEMPERAMENTS OF THE LARGE CARNIVORES\r\n\r\nThe lion is sanguine, courageous, confident, reposeful and very\r\nreliable.\r\n\r\nThe tiger is nervous, suspicious, treacherous and uncertain.\r\n\r\nThe black and common leopards are nervous and combative,\r\nirreconcilable and dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe snow leopard is sanguine, optimistic and peace-loving. The\r\npuma is sanguine, good natured, quiet and peaceful.\r\n\r\nThe wolves are sanguine, crafty, dangerous and cruel.\r\n\r\nThe foxes are hysterical, timid and full of senseless fear.\r\n\r\nThe lynxes are sanguine, philosophic, and peaceful.\r\n\r\nThe mustelines are either nervous or hysterical, courageous,\r\nsavage, and even murderous.\r\n\r\nThe bears are so very interesting that it is well worth while to\r\nconsider the leading species separately. Possibly our conclusions\r\nwill reveal some unsuspected conditions.\r\n\r\nBEAR TEMPERAMENTS, BY SPECIES. The polar bears are sanguine, but\r\nin captivity they are courageous, treacherous and dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe Alaskan brown bears in captivity are sanguine, courageous,\r\npeaceful and reliable, but in the wilds they are aggressive and\r\ndangerous.\r\n\r\nThe grizzlies are nervous, keen, cautious, and seldom wantonly\r\naggressive.\r\n\r\nThe European brown bears are sanguine, optimistic and good-\r\nnatured.\r\n\r\nThe American black bears are sanguine and quiet, but very\r\ntreacherous.\r\n\r\nThe sloth bears of India are nervous or hysterical, and uncertain.\r\n\r\nThe Malay sun bears are hysterical, aggressive and evil-tempered.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese black bears are nervous, cowardly and aggressive.\r\n\r\nTo those who form and maintain large collections of bears,\r\ninvolving much companionship in dens, it is necessary to keep a\r\nwatchful eye on the temperament chart.\r\n\r\nTHE DEER. In our Zoological Park establishment there is no\r\ncollection in which both the collective and the individual\r\nequation is more troublesome than the deer family. In their\r\nmanagement, as with apes, monkeys and bears, it is necessary to\r\ntake into account the temperament not only of the species, but\r\nalso of each animal; and there are times when this necessity bears\r\nhard upon human nerves. The proneness of captive deer to maim and\r\nto kill themselves and each other calls for the utmost vigilance,\r\nand for heroic endurance on the part of the deer keeper.\r\n\r\nEven when a deer species has a fairly good record for common\r\nsense, an individual may \"go crazy\" the instant a slightly new\r\nsituation arises. We have seen barasingha deer penned up between\r\nshock-absorbing bales of hay seriously try to jump straight up\r\nthrough a roof skylight nine feet from the floor. We have seen\r\npark-bred axis deer break their own necks against wire fences,\r\nwith 100 per cent of stupidity.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS OF DEER SPECIES\r\n\r\nThe white-tailed deer is sanguine, but in the fall the bucks are\r\nvery aggressive and dangerous, and to be carefully avoided. The\r\nmule deer is sanguine, reasonable and not particularly dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe elk is steady of nerve, and sanguine in temperament, but in\r\nthe rutting season the herd-masters are dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe fallow deer species has been toned down by a hundred\r\ngenerations of park life, and it is very quiet, save when it is to\r\nbe captured and crated.\r\n\r\nThe axis deer is nervous, flighty, and difficult to handle.\r\n\r\nThe barasingha deer is hysterical and unaccountable.\r\n\r\nThe Indian and Malay sambar deer are lymphatic, confident,\r\ntractable and easily handled.\r\n\r\nNever keep a deer as a \"pet\" any longer than is necessary to place\r\nit in a good home. All \"pet deer\" are dangerous, and should be\r\nconfined all the time. Never go into the range or corral of a deer\r\nherd unless accompanied by the deer-keeper; and in the rutting\r\nseason do not go in at all.\r\n\r\nThe only thoroughly safe deer is a dead one; for even does can do\r\nmischief. A SAMPLE OF NERVOUS TEMPERAMENT. As an example of\r\ntemperament in small carnivores, we will cite the coati mundi of\r\nSouth America. It is one of the most nervous and restless animals\r\nwe know. An individual of sanguine temperament rarely is seen. Out\r\nof about forty specimens with which we have been well acquainted,\r\nI do not recall one that was as quiet and phlegmatic as the\r\nraccoon, the nearest relative of _Nasua_. With a disposition\r\nso restless and enterprising, and with such vigor of body and\r\nmind, I count it strange that the genus _Nasua_ has not\r\nspread all over our south-eastern states, where it is surely\r\nfitted to exist in a state of nature even more successfully than\r\nthe raccoon or opossum.\r\n\r\nThe temper of the coati mundi is essentially quarrelsome and\r\naggressive. While young, they are reasonably peaceful, but when\r\nthey reach adult age, they become aggressive, and quarrels are\r\nfrequent. Separations then are very necessary, and it is rare\r\nindeed that more than two adult individuals can be caged together.\r\nEven when two only are kept together, quarrels and shrill\r\nsquealings are frequent. But they seldom hurt each other. The\r\ncoati is not a treacherous animal, it is not given to lying in\r\nwait to make a covert attack from ambush, and being almost\r\nconstantly on the move, it is a good show animal.\r\n\r\nTHE STRANGE COMBATIVE TEMPERAMENT OF THE GUANACO. In appearance\r\nthe guanaco is the personification of gentleness. Its placid\r\ncountenance indicates no guile, nor means of offense. Its lustrous\r\ngazelle-like eyes, and its soft, woolly fleece suggest softness of\r\ndisposition. But in reality no animal is more deceptive. In a wild\r\nstate amongst its own kind, or in captivity,--no matter how\r\nconsiderately treated,--it is a quarrelsome and at times\r\nintractable animal. \"A pair of wild guanacos can often be seen or\r\nheard engaged in desperate combat, biting and tearing, and rolling\r\nover one another on the ground, uttering their gurgling, bubbling\r\ncries of rage. Of a pair so engaged, I shot one whose tail had\r\nthen been bitten off in the encounter. In confinement, the guanaco\r\ncharges one with his chest, or rears up on his hind legs to strike\r\none with his fore-feet, besides biting and spitting up the\r\ncontents of the stomach.\"--Richard Crawshay in \"The Birds of Terra\r\ndel Fuego.\"\r\n\r\nMENTAL TRAITS AND TEMPER OF THE ATLANTIC WALRUS\r\n\r\nMr. Langdon Gibson, of Schenectady, kindly wrote out for me the\r\nfollowing highly interesting observations on a remarkable arctic\r\nanimal with which we are but slightly acquainted:\r\n\r\n\"In the summer of 1891, as a member of the first Peary Expedition\r\nI had an opportunity of observing some of the traits of the\r\nAtlantic walrus. I found him to be a real animal, of huge size,\r\nwith an extremely disagreeable temper and most belligerently\r\ninclined. We hunted them in open whale-boats under the shadows of\r\nGreenland's mountain-bound coast, in the Whale Sound region, Lat.\r\n77 degrees North.\r\n\r\n\"We hunted among animals never before molested, except by the\r\nEskimo who (so far as I was able to ascertain) hunt them only\r\nduring the winter season on the sea ice. We found animals whose\r\ncourage and belief in themselves and their prowess had hitherto\r\nbeen unshaken by contact with the white man and his ingenious\r\ndevices of slaughter.\r\n\r\n\"The walrus has a steady nerve and a thoroughly convincing roar.\r\nThey have fought their kind and the elements for centuries and\r\ncenturies, and know no fear. This, then, was the animal we sought\r\nin order to secure food for our dog teams. I can conceive of no\r\nform of big game hunting so conducive to great mental excitement\r\nand physical activity as walrus hunting from an open whale-boat.\r\nAt the completion of such a hunt I have seen Eskimo so excited and\r\nworked up that they were taken violently sick with vomiting and\r\nheadache.\r\n\r\n\"The walrus is a gregarious animal, confederating in herds\r\nnumbering from ten to fifty, and in some instances no doubt larger\r\nnumbers may be found together. On calm days they rest in\r\nunmolested peace on pans of broken ice which drift up and down the\r\nwaters of Whale Sound. It is unfortunate that no soundings were\r\ntaken in the region where the walrus were found, as a knowledge of\r\nthe depth of water would have furnished some information as to the\r\ndistances to which the animal will dive in search of food.\r\n\r\n\"The stomachs of all half- and full-grown walrus taken in Whale\r\nSound were without exception well filled with freshly opened\r\nclams, with very few fragments of shells in evidence; the removal\r\nof the clam from the shell being as neatly accomplished as though\r\ndone by an expert oysterman.\r\n\r\n\"In most cases these segregated herds of walrus were in charge of\r\na large bull who generally occupied a central position in the mass\r\nof animals. Upon approaching such a herd for the first time, and\r\nwhen within about 200 feet, a large bull would lift his head,\r\nsniff audibly in our direction and give a loud grunt which\r\napparently struck a responsive chord in the other sleeping\r\nanimals. They would grunt in unison, in more subdued tones, after\r\nwhich the old walrus would drop his head to resume his interrupted\r\nnap. Their contempt for us was somewhat disconcerting.\r\n\r\n\"At the first crack of a rifle, however, the animals immediately\r\naroused, and then during the fusillade which followed there\r\noccurred what might be called an orderly scramble for the water.\r\nIn the first place the young ones were hustled to the edge of the\r\nice-pan, and there, apparently under the protection of the\r\nmother's flipper, pushed into the water, immediately followed by\r\nthe mother. The young bulls followed, and I recall no exceptions\r\nwhere the last animal into the water was not the big bull, who\r\nbefore diving would give our boat a wicked look and a roar of\r\nrage.\r\n\r\n\"The animals would immediately dive, and then we first became\r\naware of a remarkable phenomenon. We found that when excited they\r\nwould continue their roaring under water, and these strange sounds\r\ncoming to us from below added considerably to the excitement of\r\nthe chase. Although the cows and young animals would generally\r\nswim to places of safety, the other full grown animals would hover\r\nbeneath our boat and from time to time come to the surface and\r\ncharge. These charges were in all cases repulsed by the discharge\r\nof our rifles in the faces of the animals. The balls, however,\r\nfrom our .45 calibre carbines would flatten out under the skin on\r\nthe massive bony structure of the animal's skull, and cause only a\r\nsort of rage and a sneeze, but it however had the effect of making\r\nthem dive again. It is my belief that when enraged the walrus if\r\nnot resisted would attack and attempt to destroy a boat. Icquah,\r\none of our native hunters, showed me in the deck of his kyak two\r\nmended punctures which he told me were made by the tusks of a\r\nwalrus that had made an _unprovoked_ attack upon him.\r\n\r\n\"On more than one occasion I have seen two strong uninjured\r\nanimals come to the assistance of a wounded companion, and swim\r\naway with it to a position of safety, _the injured animal being\r\nsupported on both sides_, giving the appearance of three\r\nanimals swimming abreast. The first time I witnessed this I did\r\nnot comprehend its real meaning, but on another occasion in\r\nMcCormick Bay I saw a wounded animal leaving a trail of blood and\r\noil, supported on either side by two uninjured ones. They were\r\nmaking a hasty retreat and would occasionally dive together, but\r\nwould quickly return to the surface.\r\n\r\n\"We found the most effective exposed spot to place a bullet was at\r\nthe base of the animal's skull. A walrus instantly killed this way\r\ngenerally sinks, leaving a trail of blood and oil to mark the\r\nplace of his descent. When hunting these animals it is well to\r\nhave an Eskimo along with harpoon and line in readiness to make\r\nfast; otherwise one is apt to lose his quarry.\r\n\r\n\"In the early winter we usually found the walrus in smaller groups\r\nup in the bays. This was after the ice had begun to make, and in\r\ncoming to the surface to breathe the animals found it necessary\r\nto butt their noses against the ice to break it. I have seen this\r\ndone in ice at least four inches in thickness. In some instances\r\nI have seen a fractured star in the ice, a record of an unsuccessful\r\nattempt to make a breathing hole.\" Around these breathing holes\r\nwe frequently found fragments of clam-shells, sections of\r\ncrinoids and sea-anemones. It is evident that after raking the\r\nbottom with his tusks and filling his mouth with food, the walrus\r\nseparates the food he desires to retain and rejects on his way up\r\nand at the surface such articles as he has picked up in haste and\r\ndoes not want.\r\n\r\n\"From the fact that the walrus is easily approached it is a simple\r\nmatter to kill him with the modern high power rule. It is\r\ntherefore to be hoped that future expeditions into the arctic seas\r\nwill kill sparingly of these tremendous brutes which from point of\r\nsize stand in the foremost rank among mammals.\"\r\n\r\nThe Elephant, Rhinoceros and Hippopotamus. _Individual\r\nElephants_ vary in temperament far more than do rhinoceroses\r\nor hippopotami, and the variations are wide. In a wild state,\r\nelephants are quiet and undemonstrative, almost to the point of\r\ndullness. They do not domineer, or hector, or quarrel, save when a\r\nrogue develops in the ranks, and sets out to make things\r\ninteresting by the commission of lawless acts. A professional\r\nrogue is about everything that an orthodox elephant should not\r\nbe, and he soon makes of himself so great a nuisance that he is\r\ndriven out of the herd.\r\n\r\nThe temperament of the standardized and normal elephant is\r\ndistinctly sanguine, _but a nervous or hysterical individual is\r\neasily developed by bad conditions or abuse_. Adult male\r\nelephants are subject to various degrees of what we may as well\r\ncall sexual insanity, which is dangerous in direct proportion to\r\nits intensity. This causes many a \"bad\" show elephant to be\r\npresented to a zoological garden, where the dangers of this mental\r\ncondition can at least be reduced to their lowest terms. Our\r\nIndian elephant who was known as Gunda was afflicted with sexual\r\ninsanity, and he gradually grew worse, and increasingly dangerous\r\nto his keepers, until finally it was necessary to end his troubles\r\npainlessly with a bullet through his brain.\r\n\r\n_The Rhinoceros_ is a sanguine animal, of rather dull vision\r\nand slow understanding. In captivity it gives little trouble, and\r\nlives long. Adults individually often become pettish, or peevish,\r\nand threaten to prod their keepers without cause, but I have never\r\nknown a keeper to take those lapses seriously. The average rhino\r\nis by no means a dull or a stupid animal, and they have quite\r\nenough life to make themselves interesting to visitors. In British\r\nEast Africa a black rhinoceros often trots briskly toward a\r\ncaravan, and seems to be charging, when in reality it is only\r\ndesiring a \"close-up\" to satisfy its legitimate curiosity.\r\n\r\n_Every Hippopotamus_, either Nile or pygmy, is an animal of\r\nserene mind and steady habits. Their appetites work with clock-\r\nlike regularity, and require no winding. I can not recall that any\r\none of our five hippos was ever sick for a day, or missed a meal.\r\nWhen the idiosyncrasies of Gunda, our bad elephant, were at their\r\nworst, the contemplation of Peter the Great ponderously and\r\nserenely chewing his hay was a rest to tired nerves. Keeper Thuman\r\ntreats the four pygmy hippos like so many pet pigs,--save the\r\nsolitary adult male, who sets himself up to be peevish. The\r\nbreeding female is a wise and good mother, with much more maternal\r\ninstinct than our chimpanzee \"Suzette.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be set down as an absolute rule that hippos are lymphatic,\r\neasy-going, contented, and easy to take care of _provided_\r\nthey are kept scrupulously clean, and are fed as they should be\r\nfed. They live long, breed persistently, give no trouble and have\r\nhigh exhibition value.\r\n\r\n_Giraffe_ individuals vary exceedingly,--beyond all other\r\nhoofed animals. Each one has its own headful of notions, and\r\nrarely will two be found quite alike in temperament and views of\r\nlife. Some are sanguine and sensible, others are nervous,\r\ncrotchety, and full of senseless fears. Those who are responsible\r\nfor them in captivity are constantly harassed by fears that they\r\nwill stampede in their stalls or yards, and break their own necks\r\nand legs in most unexpected ways. They require greater vigilance\r\nthan any other hoofed animals we know. Sometimes a giraffe will\r\ndevelop foolishness to such a degree as to be unwilling to go out\r\nof its own huge door, into a shady and comfortable yard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE LANGUAGE OF WILD ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage is the means by which men and animals express their\r\nthoughts. Of language there are four kinds: vocal, pictured,\r\nwritten and sign language.\r\n\r\nAny vocal sound uttered for the purpose of conveying thought, or\r\ninfluencing thought or action, is to be classed as vocal language.\r\nAmong the mammals below man, _speech_ is totally absent; but\r\nparrots, macaws, cockatoos and crows have been taught to imitate\r\nthe sound of man's words, or certain simple kinds of music.\r\n\r\nThe primitive races of mankind first employed the sign language,\r\nand spoken words. After that comes picture language, and lastly\r\nthe language of written words. Among the Indians and frontiersmen\r\nof the western United States and Canada, the sign language has\r\nreached what in all probability is its highest development, and\r\nits vocabulary is really wonderful.\r\n\r\nThe higher wild animals express their thoughts and feelings\r\nusually by sign language, and rarely by vocal sounds. Their power\r\nof expression varies species by species, or tribe by tribe, quite\r\nas it does among the races and tribes of men. It is our belief\r\nthat there are today several living races of men whose\r\nvocabularies are limited to about 300 words.\r\n\r\nVery many species of animals appear to be voiceless; but it is\r\nhazardous to attempt to specify the species. Sometimes under\r\nstress of new emergencies, or great pain, animals that have been\r\nconsidered voiceless suddenly give tongue. That hundreds of\r\nspecies of mammals and birds use their voices in promoting\r\nmovements for their safety, there is no room to doubt. The only\r\nquestion is of the methods and the extent of voice used. Birds and\r\nmen give expression to their pleasure or joy by singing.\r\n\r\nIn the jungle and the heavily wooded wilderness, one hears really\r\nlittle of vocal wild-animal language. Through countless\r\ngenerations the noisiest animals have been the first ones to be\r\nsought out and killed by their enemies, and only the more silent\r\nspecies have survived. All the higher animals, as we call the\r\nhigher vertebrates, have the ability to exchange thoughts and\r\nconvey ideas; and that is language.\r\n\r\nAt the threshold of this subject we are met by two interesting\r\nfacts. Excepting the song-birds, the wild creatures of today have\r\nlearned through instinct and accumulated experience that silence\r\npromotes peace and long life. The bull moose who bawls through a\r\nmile of forest, and the bull elk who bugles not wisely but too\r\nwell, soon find their heads hanging in some sportsman's dining-\r\nroom, while the silent Virginia deer, like the brook, goes on\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nAssociation with man through countless generations has taught\r\ndomestic animals not only the fact of their safety when giving\r\nvoice, but also that very often there is great virtue in a\r\nvigorous outcry. With an insistent staccato neigh, the hungry\r\nhorse jars the dull brain of its laggard master, and prompts him\r\nto \"feed and water the stock.\" But how different is the cry of a\r\nlost horse, which calls for rescue. It cannot be imitated in\r\nprinted words; but every plainsman knows the shrill and prolonged\r\ntrumpet-call of distress that can be heard a mile or more,\r\nunderstandingly.\r\n\r\nAnd think of the vocabulary of the domestic chicken! Years of life\r\nin fancied security have developed a highly useful vocabulary of\r\nlanguage calls and cries. The most important, and the best known,\r\nare the following:\r\n\r\n\"Beware the hawk!\"--\"Coor! Coor!\" \"Murder! Help!\"--\"Kee-\r\n_owk_! Kee-_owk_! Kee-_owk_!\" \"Come on\"--\"Cluck!\r\nCluck! Cluck!\" \"Food here! Food!\"--\"Cook-cook-cook-cook!\"\r\nAnnouncement, or alarm--\"Cut-cut-cut-_dah_-cut!\" But does\r\nthe wild jungle-fowl, the ancestor of our domestic chicken,\r\nindulge in all those noisy expressions of thought and feeling? By\r\nno means. I have lived for months in jungles where my hut was\r\nsurrounded by jungle-fowl, and shot many of them for my table; but\r\nthe only vocal sound I ever heard from their small throats was the\r\nabsurdly shrill bantam-like crow of the cock. And even that led to\r\nseveral fatalities in the ranks of _Gallus stanleyi_.\r\n\r\nDomestic cattle, swine and fowls have each a language of their\r\nown, and as far as they go they are almost as clear-cut and\r\nunderstandable as the talk of human beings. Just how much more is\r\nbehind the veil that limits our understanding we cannot say; but\r\nno doubt there is a great deal.\r\n\r\nBut it is with the language of wild animals that we are most\r\nconcerned. As already pointed out, wild creatures, other than\r\nsong-birds, do not care to say much, because of the danger of\r\nattracting enemies that will exterminate them. Herein lies the\r\nextreme difficulty of ascertaining how wild beasts communicate.\r\nIn the Animallai Hills of southern India I hunted constantly for\r\nmany weeks through forests actually teeming with big game. There\r\nwere herds upon herds of elephants, gaur, axis deer, sambar deer,\r\nmonkeys by the hundred, and a good sprinkling of bears, wild hogs\r\nand tigers.\r\n\r\nWe saw hundreds upon hundreds of animals; but with the exception\r\nof the big black monkeys that used to swear at us, I can almost\r\ncount upon my fingers the whole number of times that we heard\r\nanimals raise their voices to communicate with each other.\r\n\r\nApe Voices. Naturally it is of interest to know something of the\r\nvoices of the animals that physically and mentally stand nearest\r\nto man.\r\n\r\nThe wild gorilla has a voice almost equal to that of the\r\nchimpanzee, but in captivity he rarely utters any vocal sound\r\nother than a shriek, or scream.\r\n\r\nThe baby orang-utan either whines or shrieks like a human child.\r\nThe half-grown or adult orang when profoundly excited bellows or\r\nroars, in a deep bass voice. Usually, however, it is a\r\npersistently silent animal.\r\n\r\nThe chimpanzee has a voice, and vociferously expresses its\r\nemotions.\r\n\r\nFirst and most often is the plaintive, coaxing note, \"Who'-oo!\r\nwho'-oo! who'-oo!\"\r\n\r\nThen comes the angry and threatening, \"Wah', wah', wah-!\r\n_Wah'_-hool _Wah'_-hool\"\r\n\r\nLastly we hear the fearful, high-pitched yell or shriek, \"Ah-h-h-\r\nh!\" or \"E-e-e-e.\"\r\n\r\nThe shriek, or scream, can be heard half a mile, and at close\r\nrange it is literally ear-splitting. Usually it is accompanied by\r\nviolent stamping or pounding with the feet upon the floor. It may\r\nsignify rage, or nothing more than the joy of living, and of\r\nhaving a place in which to yell. It is this cry that is uncannily\r\nhuman-like in sound, and when heard for the first time it seems to\r\nregister anguish.\r\n\r\nIn its Bornean jungle home, the orang-utan is nearly as silent as\r\nthe grave. Never save once did I hear one utter a vocal sound.\r\nThat was a deep bass roar emitted by an old male that I disturbed\r\nwhile he was sleeping on the comfortable nest of green branches\r\nthat he had built for himself.\r\n\r\nConcerning the chimpanzee, the late Mr. Richard L. Garner\r\ntestified as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Not only does the chimpanzee often break the silence of the\r\nforest when all other voices are hushed, but he frequently answers\r\nthe sounds of other animals, as if in mockery or defiance. ...\r\nAlthough diurnal in habit, the chimpanzees often make the night\r\nreverberate with the sounds of their terrific screaming, which I\r\nhave known them to continue at times for more than an hour, with\r\nscarcely a moment's pause,--not one voice but many, and within\r\nthe area of a square mile or so I have distinguished as many as\r\nseven alternating adult male voices.\r\n\r\n\"The gorilla is more silent and stoical than the chimpanzee, but\r\nhe is far from being mute. He appears to be devoid of all\r\nrisibility, but he is often very noisy. Although diurnal in habit,\r\nhe talks less frequently during the day than at night, but his\r\nsilence is a natural consequence of his stealth and cunning. There\r\nare times, however, when he ignores all danger of betraying his\r\nwhereabouts or his movements, and gives vent to a deluge of\r\nspeech. At night his screams and shouts are terrific.\"\r\n\r\nThe gibbons (including the siamang) have tremendous voices, with\r\nnumerous variations, and they love to use them. My acquaintance\r\nwith them began in Borneo, in the dense and dark coastal forest\r\nthat there forms their home. I remember their cries as vividly as\r\nif I had heard them again this morning. While feeding, or quietly\r\nenjoying the morning sun, the gray gibbon (_Hylobates\r\nconcolor_) emits in leisurely succession a low staccato,\r\nwhistle-like cry, like \"Hoot! Hoot! Hoot!\" which one can easily\r\ncounterfeit by whistling. This is varied by another whistle cry of\r\nthree notes, thus: \"Who-ee-hoo! Who-ee-hoo!\" also to be duplicated\r\nby whistling. In hunting for specimens of that gibbon, for\r\nAmerican museums, I could rarely locate a troop save by the tree-\r\ntop talk of its members.\r\n\r\nBut all this was only childish prattle in comparison with the\r\ndaily performances of the big white-handed, and the black hoolock\r\ngibbons, now and for several years past residing in our Primate\r\nHouse. Every morning, and perhaps a dozen times during the day,\r\nthose three gibbons go on a vocal rampage and utter prolonged and\r\near-splitting cries and shrieks that make the welkin ring. The\r\nshrieking chorus is usually prolonged until it becomes tiresome to\r\nthe monkeys. In all our ape and monkey experience we never have\r\nknown its equal save in the vocal performances of Boma, our big\r\nadult male chimpanzee, the husband of Suzette.\r\n\r\nA baboon emits occasionally, and without any warning, a fearful\r\nexplosive bark, or roar, that to visitors is as startling as the\r\nreport of a gun. The commonest expressions are \"Wah!\" and\r\n\"_Wah'_-hoo!\", and the visitor who can hear it close at hand\r\nwithout jumping has good nerves.\r\n\r\nThe big and solemn long-nosed monkey of Borneo (_Nasalis\r\nlarvatus_) utters in his native tree-top (overhanging water), a\r\ncry like the resonant \"honk\" of a saxophone. He says plainly, \"Kee\r\nhonk,\" and all that I could make of its meaning was that it is\r\nused as the equivalent of \"All's well.\"\r\n\r\nOf all the monkeys that I have ever known, either wild or in\r\ncaptivity, the red howlers of the Orinoco, in Venezuela, have the\r\nmost remarkable voices, and make the most remarkable use of them.\r\nThe hyoid cartilage is expanded,--for Nature's own particular\r\nreasons,--into a wonderful sound-box, as big as an English walnut,\r\nwhich gives to the adult voice a depth of pitch and a booming\r\nresonance that is impossible to describe. The note produced is a\r\nprolonged bass roar, in alternately rising and falling cadence,\r\nand in reality comprising about three notes. It is the habit of\r\ntroops of red howlers to indulge in nocturnal concerts, wherein\r\nfour, five or six old males will pipe up and begin to howl in\r\nunison. The great volume of uncanny sound thus produced goes\r\nrolling through the still forest, far and wide; and to the white\r\nexplorer who lies in his grass hammock in pitchy darkness,\r\nfighting off the mosquitoes and loneliness, and wondering from\r\nwhence tomorrow's meals will come, the moral effect is gruesome\r\nand depressing.\r\n\r\nIn captivity the youthful howler habitually growls and grumbles in\r\na way that is highly amusing, and the absurd pitch of the deep\r\nbass voice issuing from so small an animal is cause for wonder.\r\n\r\nIt is natural that we should look closely to the apes and monkeys\r\nfor language, both by voice and sign. In 1891 there was a flood of\r\ntalk on \"the speech of monkeys,\" and it was not until about 1904\r\nthat the torrent stopped. At first the knowledge that monkeys can\r\nand do communicate to a limited extent by vocal sounds was hailed\r\nas a \"discovery\"; but unfortunately for science, nothing has been\r\nproved beyond the long-known fact that primates of a given species\r\nunderstand the meaning of the few sounds and cries to which their\r\nkind give utterance.\r\n\r\nThus far I have never succeeded in teaching a chimpanzee or\r\norangutan to say even as much as \"Oh\" or \"Ah.\" Nothing seems to be\r\nfurther from the mind of an orang than the idea of a new vocal\r\nutterance as a means to an end.\r\n\r\nOur Polly was the most affectionate and demonstrative chimpanzee\r\nthat I have ever seen, and her reaction to my voice was the best\r\nthat I have found in our many apes. She knew me well, and when I\r\ngreeted her in her own language, usually she answered me promptly\r\nand vociferously. Often when she had been busy with her physical-\r\nculture exercises and Delsartean movements on the horizontal bars\r\nor the trapeze in the centre of her big cage, I tested her by\r\nquietly joining the crowd of visitors in the centre of the room\r\nbefore her cage, and saying to her: \"Polly! Wah! Wah! Wah!\"\r\n\r\nNearly every time she would stop short, give instant attention and\r\njoyously respond \"Wah! Wah! Wah!\", repeating the cry a dozen times\r\nwhile she clambered down to the lower front bars to reach me with\r\nher hands. When particularly excited she would cry \"_Who_-oo!\r\n_Who_-oo! _Who_-oo!\" with great clearness and vehemence,\r\nthe two syllables pitched four notes apart. This cry was uttered\r\nas a joyous greeting, and also at feeding-time, in expectation of\r\nfood; but, simple as the task seems to be, I really do not know\r\nhow to translate its meaning into English. In one case it appears\r\nto mean \"How do you do?\" and in the other it seems to stand for\r\n\"Hurry up!\"\r\n\r\nPolly screamed when angry or grieved, just like a naughty child;\r\nand her face assumed the extreme of screaming-child expression.\r\nShe whined plaintively when coaxing, or when only slightly\r\ngrieved. With these four manifestations her vocal powers seemed to\r\nstop short. Many times I opened her mouth widely with my fingers,\r\nand tried to surprise her into saying \"Ah,\" but with no result. It\r\nseems almost impossible to stamp the vocal-sound idea upon the\r\nmind of an orang-utan or chimpanzee. Polly uttered two distinct\r\nand clearly cut syllables, and it really seemed as if her vocal\r\norgans could have done more if called upon.\r\n\r\nThe cries of the monkeys, baboons and lemurs are practically\r\nnothing more than squeals, shrieks or roars. The baboons (several\r\nspecies, at least) bark or roar most explosively, using the\r\nsyllable \"Wah!\" It is only by the most liberal interpretation of\r\nterms that such cries can be called language. The majority express\r\nonly two emotions--dissatisfaction and expectation. Every primate\r\ncalls for help in the same way that human beings do, by shrill\r\nscreaming; but none of them ever cry \"Oh\" or \"Ah.\"\r\n\r\nThe only members of the monkey tribe who ever spoke to me in their\r\nnative forests were the big black langurs of the Animallai Hills\r\nin Southern India. They used to glare down at us, and curse us\r\nhorribly whenever we met. Had we been big pythons instead of men\r\nthey could not have said \"Confound you!\" any more plainly or more\r\nvehemently than they did.\r\n\r\nIn those museum-making days our motto was \"All's fish that cometh\r\nto net\"; and we killed monkeys for their skins and skeletons the\r\nsame as other animals. My brown-skinned Mulcer hunters said that\r\nthe bandarlog hated me because of my white skin. At all events, as\r\nwe stalked silently through those forests, half a dozen times a\r\nday we would hear an awful explosion overhead, startling to men\r\nwho were still-hunting big game, and from the middle zone of the\r\ntree-tops black and angry faces would peer down at us. They said:\r\n\"Wah! Wah! Wah! Ah-^oo-oo-Aoo-oo-^oo-oo!\" and it was nothing else\r\nthan cursing and blackguarding. How those monkeys did hate us! I\r\nnever have encountered elsewhere anything like it in monkey-land.\r\nla 1902 there was a startling exhibition of monkey language at\r\nour Primate House. That was before the completion of the Lion House.\r\nWe had to find temporary outdoor quarters for the big jaguar,\r\n\"Senor Lopez\"; and there being nothing else available, we decided\r\nto place him, for a few days only, in the big circular cage at the\r\nnorth end of the range of outside cages. It was May, and the\r\nbaboons, red-faced monkeys, rhesus, green and many other of the\r\nmonkeys were in their outside quarters.\r\n\r\nI was not present when Lopez was turned into the big: cage; but I\r\nheard it. Down through the woods to the polar bears' den, a good\r\nquarter of a mile, came a most awful uproar, made by many voices.\r\nThe bulk of it was a medley of raucous yells and screeches, above\r\nwhich it was easy to distinguish the fierce, dog-like barks and\r\nroars of the baboons.\r\n\r\nWe knew at once that Lopez had arrived. Hurrying up to the Primate\r\nHouse, we found the wire fronts of the outside cages literally\r\nplastered with monkeys and baboons, all in the wildest excitement.\r\nThe jaguar was in full view of them, and although not one out of\r\nthe whole lot, except the sapajous, ever had an ancestor who had\r\nseen a jaguar, one and all recognized a hostile genus, and a\r\nhereditary enemy.\r\n\r\nAnd how they cursed him, reviled him, and made hideous faces at\r\nhim! The long-armed yellow baboons barked and roared until they\r\nwere heard half a mile away. The ugly-tempered macaques and\r\nrhesus monkeys nearly burst with hatred and indignation. The row\r\nwas kept up for a long time, and the monkey language that was lost\r\nto science on that occasion was, both in quantity and quality,\r\nbeyond compare.\r\n\r\nBear Language. In their native haunts bears are as little given\r\nto loud talk as other animals; but in roomy and comfortable\r\ncaptivity, where many are yarded together, they rapidly develop\r\nvocal powers. Our bears are such cheerful citizens, and they do so\r\nmany droll things, that the average visitor works overtime in\r\nwatching them. I have learned the language of our bears\r\nsufficiently that whenever I hear one of them give tongue I know\r\nwhat he says. For example:\r\n\r\nIn warning or threatening an enemy, the sloth bear says: \"Ach!\r\nAch! Ach!\" and the grizzly says: \"Woof! Woof!\" A fighting bear\r\nsays: \"Aw-aw-aw!\" A baby's call for its mother is \"Row! Row!\" A\r\nbear's distress call is: \"Err-_wow_-oo-oo-oof!\"\r\n\r\nBut even in a zoological park it is not possible for everyone to\r\nrecognize and interpret the different cries of bears, although the\r\nability to do so is sometimes of value to the party of the second\r\npart. For example:\r\n\r\nOne day in February I was sitting in my old office in the Service\r\nBuilding, engrossed in I know not what important and solemn\r\nmatter. The park was quiet; for the snow lay nine inches deep over\r\nall. There were no visitors, and the maintenance men were\r\nsilently shovelling. Over the hill from the bear dens came the\r\nvoice of a bear. It said, as plainly as print: \"Err-wow!\" I said\r\nto myself: \"That sounds like a distress call,\" and listened to\r\nhear it repeated.\r\n\r\nAgain it came: \"Err-wow!\"\r\n\r\nI caught up my hat and hastened over the hill toward the bear\r\ndens. On the broad concrete walk, about a hundred feet from the\r\ndens, four men were industriously shovelling snow, unaware that\r\nanything was wrong anywhere except on the pay-roll, opposite their\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nGuided by the cries that came from \"The Nursery\" den, where six\r\nyearling cubs were kept, I quickly caught sight of the trouble.\r\nOne of our park-born brown bear cubs was hanging fast by one\r\nforefoot from the top of the barred partition. He had climbed to\r\nthe top of the ironwork, thrust one front paw through between two\r\nof the bars (for bears are the greatest busybodies on earth), and\r\nwhen he sought to withdraw it, the sharp point of a bar in the\r\noverhang of the tree-guard had buried itself in the back of his\r\npaw, and held him fast. It seemed as if his leg was broken, and\r\nalso dislocated at the shoulder. No wonder the poor little chap\r\nsqualled for help. His mother, on the other side of the partition,\r\nwas almost frantic with baffled sympathy, for she could do nothing\r\nto help him.\r\n\r\nIt did not take more than a quarter of a minute to have several\r\nmen running for crowbars and other things, and within five minutes\r\nfrom the discovery we were in the den ready for action. The little\r\nchap gave two or three cries to let us know how badly it hurt his\r\nleg to hang there, then bent his small mind upon rendering us\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nFirst we lifted him up bodily, and held him, to remove the strain.\r\nThen, by good luck, we had at hand a stout iron bar with a U-\r\nshaped end; and with that under the injured wrist, and a crowbar\r\nto spring the treacherous overhang, we lifted the foot clear, and\r\nlowered little Brownie to the floor. From first to last he helped\r\nus all he could, and seemed to realize that it was clearly \"no\r\nfair\" to bite or scratch. Fortunately the leg was neither broken\r\nnor dislocated, and although Brownie limped for ten days, he soon\r\nwas all right again.\r\n\r\nAfter the incident had been closed, I gave the men a brief lecture\r\non the language of bears, and the necessity of being able to\r\nrecognize the distress call.\r\n\r\nYou can chase bison, elephants and deer all day without hearing a\r\nsingle vocal utterance. They know through long experience the\r\nvalue of silence.\r\n\r\nThe night after I shot my second elephant we noted an exception.\r\nThe herd had been divided by our onslaught. Part of it had gone\r\nnorth, part of it south, and our camp for the night (beside the\r\ndead tusker) lay midway between the two. About bedtime the\r\nelephants began signalling to each other by trumpeting, and what\r\nthey sounded was \"The assembly.\" They called and answered\r\nrepeatedly; and finally it became clear to my native followers\r\nthat the two herds were advancing to unite, and were likely to\r\nmeet in our vicinity. That particular trumpet call was different\r\nfrom any other I have ever heard. It was a regular \"Hello\" signal-\r\ncall, entirely different from the \"Tal-_loo_-e\" blast which\r\nonce came from a feeding herd and guided us to it.\r\n\r\nBut it is only on rare occasions that elephants communicate with\r\neach other by sound. I once knew a general alarm to be\r\ncommunicated throughout a large herd by the sign language, and a\r\nretreat organized and carried out in absolute silence. Their\r\ndanger signals to each other must have been made with their trunks\r\nand their ears; but we saw none of them, because all the animals\r\nwere concealed from our view except when the two scouts of the\r\nherd were hunting for us.\r\n\r\nIn captivity an elephant trumpets in protest, or through fear, or\r\nthrough rage; but I am obliged to confess that as yet I cannot\r\npositively distinguish one from the other.\r\n\r\nOnce in the Zoological Park I heard our troublesome Indian\r\nelephant, Alice, roaring continuously as if in pain. It continued\r\nat such a rate that I hurried over to the Elephant House to\r\ninvestigate. And there I saw a droll spectacle. Keeper Richards\r\nhad taken Alice out into her yard for exercise and had ordered\r\nher to follow him. And there he was disgustedly marching around\r\nthe yard while Alice marched after him at an interval of ten\r\npaces, quite free and untrammeled, but all the while lustily\r\ntrumpeting and roaring in indignant protest. The only point at\r\nwhich she was hurt was in her feelings.\r\n\r\nTwo questions that came into public notice concerning the voices\r\nof two important American animals have been permanently settled\r\nby \"the barnyard naturalists\" of New York.\r\n\r\nThe Voice of the American Bison. In 1907 the statement of George\r\nCatlin, to the effect that in the fall the bellowing of buffalo\r\nbulls on the plains resembled the muttering of distant thunder,\r\nwas denied and severely criticized in a sportsman's magazine. On\r\nOctober 4 of that year, while we were selecting the fifteen bison\r\nto be presented to the Government, to found the Wichita National\r\nBison Herd, four of us heard our best bull _bellow_ five\r\ntimes, while another did the same thing four times.\r\n\r\nThe sound uttered was a deep-voiced roar,--not a grunt,--rising\r\nand falling in measured cadence, and prolonged about four or five\r\nseconds. It was totally different from the ordinary grunt of\r\nhunger, or the menace of an angry buffalo, which is short and\r\nsharp. In discussing the quality of the bellow, we agreed that it\r\ncould properly be called a low roar. It is heard only in the\r\nrutting season,--the period described by Catlin,--and there is\r\ngood reason to believe that Caitlin's description is perfectly\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nThe Scream of the Puma. This is a subject that will not lie still.\r\nI presume it will recur every five years as long as pumas endure.\r\nUncountable pages of controversial letters have been expended upon\r\nthe question: \"Does the puma ever scream, like a woman in\r\ndistress?\"\r\n\r\nThe true answer is easy, and uncontestable by people whose minds\r\nare open to the rules of evidence.\r\n\r\nYes; the adult female puma DOES scream,-_in the mating\r\nseason_, whenever it comes. It is loud, piercing, prolonged,\r\nand has the agonized voice qualities of a boy or a woman screaming\r\nfrom the pain of a surgical operation. To one who does not know\r\nthe source or the cause, it is nerve-racking. When heard in a\r\nremote wilderness it must be truly fearsome. It says \"Ow-w-w-w!\"\r\nover and over. We have heard it a hundred times or more, and it\r\neasily carries a quarter of a mile.\r\n\r\nThe language of animals is a long and interesting subject,--so\r\nmuch so that here it is possible only to sketch out and suggest\r\nits foundations and scope. On birds alone, an entire volume should\r\nbe written; but animal intelligence is a subject as far reaching\r\nas the winds of the earth.\r\n\r\nNo man who ever saw high in the heavens a V-shaped flock of wild\r\ngeese, or heard the honk language either afloat, ashore or in the\r\nair, will deny the spoken language of that species. If any one\r\nshould do so, let him listen to the wild-goose wonder tales of\r\nJack Miner, and hear him imitate (to perfection) the honk call of\r\nthe gander at his pond, calling to wild flocks in the sky and\r\ntelling them about the corn and safety down where he is.\r\n\r\nThe woodpecker drums on the high and dry limb of a dead tree his\r\nresounding signal-call that is nothing more nor less (in our view)\r\nthan so much sign language.\r\n\r\nIt was many years ago that we first heard in the welcome days of\r\nearly spring the resounding _\"Boo-hoo-hoo\"_ courting call of\r\nthe cock pinnated grouse, rolling over the moist earth for a mile\r\nor more in words too plain to be misunderstood.\r\n\r\nThe American magpie talks beautifully; but I regret to say that I\r\ndo not understand a word of its language. One summer we had\r\nseveral fine specimens in the great flying-cage, with the big and\r\nshowy waterfowl, condor, griffon vulture, ravens and crows. One of\r\nthose magpies often came over to the side of the cage to talk to\r\nme, and as I believe, make complaints. Whether he complained about\r\nhis big and bulky cagemates, or the keepers, or me, I could not\r\ntell; but I thought that his grievances were against the large\r\nbirds. Whenever I climbed over the guard rail and stooped down, he\r\nwould come close up to the wire, stand in one spot, and in a\r\nquiet, confidential tone talk to me earnestly and gesticulate with\r\nhis head for five minutes straight. I have heard senile old men\r\nrun on in low-voiced, unintelligible clack in precisely the same\r\nway. The modulations of that bird's voice, its inflections and its\r\nvocabulary were wonderful. From his manner a messenger from Mars\r\nmight easily have inferred that the bird believed that every word\r\nof the discourse was fully understood.\r\n\r\nThe lion roars, magnificently. The hyena \"laughs\"; the gray wolf\r\ngives a mournful howl, the coyote barks and howls, and the fox\r\nyaps. The elk bugles, the moose roars and bawls, in desire or\r\ndefiance. The elephant trumpets or screams in the joy of good\r\nfeeding, or in fear or rage; and it also rumbles deeply away down\r\nin its throat. The red squirrel barks and chatters, usually to\r\nscold some one whom he hates, but other small rodents know that\r\nsilence is golden.\r\n\r\nThe birds have the best voices of all creatures. They are the\r\nsweet singers of the animal world, and to the inquiring mind that\r\nfield is a wonderland.\r\n\r\nThe frogs are vociferous; and now if they were more silent they\r\nwould last longer.\r\n\r\nOf all the reptiles known to me, only two utter vocal sounds,--the\r\nalligator and the elephant tortoise. The former roars or bellows,\r\nthe latter grunts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE MOST INTELLIGENT ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the professional animal-man, year in and year out comes the\r\neternal question, \"Which are the most intelligent animals?\"\r\n\r\nThe question is entirely legitimate. What animals are the best\r\nexponents of animal intelligence?\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the numerous factors involved, and the\r\ncomparisons that must be made, can best be expressed in figures.\r\nOpinions that are based upon only one or two sets of facts are not\r\nworth much. There are about ten factors to be taken into account\r\nand appraised separately.\r\n\r\nIn order to express many opinions in a small amount of space, we\r\nsubmit a table of estimates and summaries, covering a few\r\nmammalian species that are representative of many. But, try as\r\nthey will, it is not likely that any two animal men will set down\r\nthe same estimates. It all depends upon the wealth or the poverty\r\nof first-hand, eye-witness evidence. When we enter the field of\r\nevidence that must stand in quotation marks, we cease to know\r\nwhere we will come out. We desire to state that nearly all of the\r\nfigures in the attached table of estimates are based upon the\r\nauthor's own observations, made during a period of more than\r\nforty years of ups and downs with wild animals.

His mind approaches most\r\nclosely to that of man, and it carries him farthest upward toward\r\nthe human level. He can learn more by training, and learn more\r\neasily, than any other animal.\r\n\r\nThe Orang-Utan is mentally next to the chimpanzee.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Elephant in mental capacity is third from man.\r\n\r\nThe high-class domestic Horse is a very wise and capable animal;\r\nbut this is chiefly due to its age-long association with man, and\r\neducation by him. Mentally the wild horse is a very different\r\nanimal, and in the intellectual scale it ranks with the deer and\r\nantelopes.\r\n\r\nThe Beaver manifests, in domestic economy, more intelligence,\r\nmechanical skill and reasoning power than any other wild animal.\r\n\r\nThe Lion is endowed with keen perceptive faculties, reasoning\r\nability and judgment of a high order, and its mind is\r\nsurprisingly receptive.\r\n\r\nThe Grizzly Bear is believed to be the wisest of all bears.\r\n\r\nThe Pack Rat (_Neotona_) is the intellectual phenomenon of\r\nthe great group of gnawing animals. It is in a class by itself.\r\n\r\nThe White Mountain Goat seems to be the wisest of all the mountain\r\nsummit animals whose habits are known to zoologists and sportsmen.\r\n\r\nA high-class Dog is the animal that mentally is in closest touch\r\nwith the mind, the feelings and the impulses of man; and it is the\r\nonly one that can read a man's feelings from his eyes and his\r\nfacial expression.\r\n\r\nThe Marvelous Beaver. Let us consider this animal as an\r\nilluminating example of high-power intelligence.\r\n\r\nIn domestic economy the beaver is the most intelligent of all\r\nliving mammals. His inherited knowledge, his original thought, his\r\nreasoning power and his engineering and mechanical skill in\r\nconstructive works are marvelous and beyond compare. In his\r\nmanifold industrial activities, there is no other mammal that is\r\neven a good second to him. He builds dams both great and\r\nsmall, to provide water in which to live, to store food and to\r\nescape from his enemies. He builds air-tight houses of sticks and\r\nmud, either as islands, or on the shore. When he cannot live as a\r\npond-beaver with a house he cheerfully becomes a river-beaver.\r\nHe lives in a river-bank burrow when house-building in a pond\r\nis impossible; and he will cheerfully tunnel under a stone wall\r\nfrom one-pond monotony, to go exploring outside.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHRISTMAS AT THE\r\nPRIMATES' HOUSE Chimpanzees (with large ears) and orang-utans\r\n(small ears). The animal on the extreme right is an orang of the\r\ncommon caste]\r\n\r\nHe cuts down trees, both small and large, and he makes them fall\r\nas he wishes them to fall. He trims off all branches, and leaves\r\nno \"slash\" to cumber the ground. He buries green branches, in\r\ngreat quantity, in the mud at the bottom of his pond, so that in\r\nwinter he can get at them under a foot of solid ice. He digs\r\ncanals, of any length he pleases, to float logs and billets of\r\nwood from hinterland to pond.\r\n\r\nIf you are locating beavers in your own zoo, and are wise, you can\r\ninduce beavers to build their dam where you wish it to be. This is\r\nhow we did it!\r\n\r\nWe dug out a pond of mud in order that the beavers might have a\r\npond of water; and we wished the beavers to build a dam forty feet\r\nlong, at a point about thirty feet from the iron fence where the\r\nbrook ran out. On thinking it over we concluded that we could\r\nmanage it by showing the animals where we wished them to go to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nWe set a l2-inch plank on its edge, all the way across the dam\r\nsite, and pegged it down. Above it the water soon formed a little\r\npool and began to flow over the top edge in a very miniature\r\nwaterfall. Then we turned loose four beavers and left them.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we found a cart-load of sticks and fresh mud\r\nplaced like a dam against the iron fence. In beaver language this\r\nsaid to us:\r\n\r\n\"We would rather build our dam here,--if you don't mind. It will\r\nbe easier for us, and quicker.\"\r\n\r\nWe removed all their material; and in our language that action\r\nsaid: \"No; we would rather have you build over the plank.\"\r\n\r\nThe next night more mud and sticks piled against the fence said to\r\nus,\r\n\r\n\"We really _insist_ upon building it here!\"\r\n\r\nWe made a second clearance of their materials, saying in effect:\r\n\r\n\"You _shall not_ build against the fence! You _must_\r\nbuild where we tell you!\"\r\n\r\nThereupon, the beavers began to build over the plank, saying,\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, if you are going to make a fuss about it, we will let\r\nyou have your way.\"\r\n\r\nSo they built a beautiful water-tight dam precisely where we\r\nsuggested it to them, and after that our only trouble was to keep\r\nthem from overdoing the matter, and flooding the whole valley.\r\n\r\nI am not going to dwell upon the mind and manners of the beaver.\r\nThe animal is well known. Three excellent books have been written\r\nand pictured about him, in the language that the General Reader\r\nunderstands. They are as follows: \"The American Beaver and His\r\nWorks,\" Lewis H. Morgan (1868); \"The Romance of the Beaver,\" A. R.\r\nDugmore (no date); \"History and Traditions of the Canada Beaver,\"\r\nH. T. Martin (1892).\r\n\r\n\"Clever Hans,\" the \"Thinking Horse.\" From 1906 to 1910 the world\r\nread much about a wonderful educated horse owned and educated by\r\nHerr von Osten, in Germany. The German scientists who first came\r\nin touch with \"Hans\" were quite bowled over by the discovery that\r\nthat one horse could \"think.\" The _Review of Reviews_ said,\r\nin 1910:\r\n\r\n\"It may be recalled that Clever Hans knew figures and letters,\r\ncolors and tones, the calendar and the dial, that he could count\r\nand read, deal with decimals and fractions, spell out answers to\r\nquestions with his right hoof, and recognize people from having\r\nseen their photographs. In every case his 'replies' were given in\r\nthe form of scrapings with his right forehoof.\r\n\r\n\"Whether the questioner was von Osten, who had worked with him for\r\nseven years, or a man like Schillings, who was a complete\r\nstranger, seemed immaterial; and this went farthest, perhaps, in\r\ndisposing of all talk of 'collusion' between master and beast.\"\r\n\r\nNow, by the bald records of the case the fact was fixed for all\r\ntime that Hans was the most wonderful mental prodigy that ever\r\nbore the form of a four-footed animal. His learning and his\r\nperformances were astounding, and even uncanny. I do not care how\r\nhe was trained, nor by what process he received ideas and reacted\r\nto them! He was a phenomenon, and I doubt whether this world ever\r\nsees his like again. His mastery of figures alone, no matter how\r\nit was wrought, was enough to make any animal or trainer\r\nillustrious.\r\n\r\nBut eventually Clever Hans came to grief. He was ostensibly\r\nthrown off his pedestal, in Germany, by human jealousy and\r\negotism. Several industrious German scientists deliberately set\r\nto work to discredit him, and they stuck to it until they\r\naccomplished that task. The chief instrument in this was no less a\r\nman than the director of the \"Psychological Institute\" of the\r\nBerlin University, Professor Otto Pfungst. He found that when Hans\r\nwas put on the witness stand and subjected to rigid cross\r\nexaminations _by strangers_, his answers were due partly to\r\n_telepathy and hypnotic influence_! For example, the\r\ndiscovery was made that Hans could not always give the correct\r\nanswer to a problem in figures unless it was known to the\r\nquestioner himself.\r\n\r\nTo Hans's inquisitors this discovery imparted a terrible shock. It\r\ndid not look like \"thinking\" after all! The mental process was\r\n_different_ from the process of the German mind! The\r\nwonderful fact that Hans could remember and recognize and\r\n_reproduce_ the ten digits was entirely lost to view. At once\r\na shout went up all over Germany,--in the scientific circle, that\r\nHans was an \"impostor,\" that he could not \"think,\" and that his\r\nmind was nothing much after all.\r\n\r\nPoor Hans! The glory that should have been his, and imperishable,\r\nis gone. He was the victim of scientists of one idea, who had no\r\nsense of proportion. He truly WAS a thinking horse; and we are\r\nsure that there are millions of men whose minds could not be\r\ndeveloped to the point that the mind of that \"dumb\" animal\r\nattained,--no, not even with the aid of hypnotism and telepathy.\r\n\r\nThe bare fact that a horse _can_ be influenced by occult\r\nmental powers proves the close parallelism that exists between the\r\nbrains of men and beasts. The Trap-Door Spider. Let no one\r\nsuppose for one moment that animal mind and intelligence is\r\nlimited to the brain-bearing vertebrates. The scope and activity\r\nof the notochord in some of the invertebrates present phenomena\r\nfar more wonderful per capita than many a brain produces.\r\nInteresting books have been written, and more will be written\r\nhereafter, on the minds and doings of ants, bees, wasps, spiders\r\nand other insects.\r\n\r\nConsider the ways and means of the ant-lion of the East, and the\r\ntrap-door spider of the western desert regions. As one object\r\nlesson from the insect world, I will flash upon the screen, for a\r\nmoment only, the trap-door spider. This wonderful insect personage\r\nhas been exhaustively studied by Mr. Raymond L. Ditmars, in the\r\ndevelopment of a series of moving pictures, and at my request he\r\nhas contributed the following graphic description of this\r\nspider's wonderful work.\r\n\r\n\"The trap-door spiders, inhabiting the warmer portions of both the\r\nOld and New Worlds, dig a deep tunnel in the soil, line this with\r\na silken wallpaper, then construct a hinged door at the top so\r\nperfectly fitted and camouflaged with soil, that when it is closed\r\nthere is no indication of the burrow. Moreover, the inside portion\r\nof the door of some species is so constructed that it may be\r\n\"latched,\" there being two holes near the edge, precisely placed\r\nwhere the curved fangs may be inserted and the door held firmly\r\nclosed. Also, the trap-door of a number of species is so designed\r\nas to be absolutely rain-proof, being bevelled and as accurately\r\nfitting a corresponding bevel of the tube as the setting of a\r\ncompression valve of a gasolene engine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TRAP-DOOR\r\nSPIDER'S DOOR AND BURROW By R. L. Ditmars 1. The door closed. Its\r\ntop carefully counterfeits the surrounding ground. 2. The door\r\nwith silken hinge, held open by a needle. 3. The spider in its\r\ndoorway, looking for prey. 4. Section of the burrow and trap-\r\ndoor.]\r\n\r\n\"The study of a number of specimens of our southern California\r\nspecies, which builds the cork-type door, including observations\r\nof them at night, when they are particularly active, indicates\r\nthat the construction of the tube involves other material than the\r\nsilken lining employed by many burrowing spiders. In the\r\nexcavation of the tube and retention of the walls, the spider\r\nappears to employ a glairy substance, which thoroughly saturates\r\nthe soil and renders the interior of the tube of almost cement-\r\nlike hardness. It is then plastered with a thick jet of silk from\r\nthe spinning glands. This interior finishing process appears to\r\nbe quite rapid, a burrow being readily lined within a couple of\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\"The construction of the trap-door is a far more complicated\r\nprocess, this convex, beautifully bevelled entrance with its hinge\r\nrequiring real scientific skill. Judging from observations on a\r\nnumber of specimens, the work is done from the outside, the spider\r\nfirst spinning a net-like covering over the mouth of the tube.\r\nThis is thickened by weaving the body over the net, each motion\r\nleaving a smoky trail of silk. Earth is then shoveled into the\r\ncovering, the spider carefully pushing the particles toward the\r\ncentre, which soon sags, and assumes the proper curvature, and\r\nautomatically moulds against the bevelled walls of the tube.\r\n\r\n\"The shoveling process must be nicely regulated to produce the\r\nproper bevel and thickness of the door. Then the cementing\r\nprocess is applied to the top, rendering the door a solid unit.\r\nFrom the actions of these spiders,--which often calmly rest an\r\nhour without a move,--it appears that the edges of the door are\r\nnow subjected, by the stout and sharp fangs, to a cutting process\r\nlike that of a can opener, leaving a portion of the marginal silk\r\nto act as a hinge. This hinge afterward receives some finishing\r\ntouches, and the top of the door is either pebbled or finished\r\nwith a few fragments of dead vegetation, cemented on, in order to\r\nexactly match the surrounding soil.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHTS OF WILD ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery harmless wild bird and mammal has the right to live out its\r\nlife according to its destiny; and man is in honor bound to\r\nrespect those rights. At the same time it is a mistake to regard\r\neach wild bird or quadruped as a sacred thing, which under no\r\ncircumstances may be utilized by man. We are not fanatical Hindus\r\nof the castes which religiously avoid the \"taking of life\" of any\r\nkind, and gently push aside the flea, the centipede and the\r\nscorpion. The reasoning powers of such people are strictly\r\nlimited, the same as those of people who are opposed to the\r\nremoval by death of the bandits and murderers of the human race.\r\n\r\nThe highest duty of a reasoning being is to reason. We have no\r\nmoral or legal right to act like idiots, or to become a menace to\r\nsociety by protecting criminal animals or criminal men from\r\nadequate punishment. Like the tree that is known by its fruit,\r\nevery alleged \"reasoning being\" is to be judged by the daily\r\noutput of his thoughts.\r\n\r\nToward wild life, our highest duty is to be sane and sensible, in\r\norder to be just, and to promote the greatest good for the\r\ngreatest number. Be neither a Hindu fanatic nor a cruel game-\r\nbutcher like a certain wild-animal slaughterer whom I knew, who\r\nwhile he was on earth earned for himself a place in the hottest\r\ncorner of the hereafter, and quickly passed on to occupy it.\r\n\r\nThe following planks constitute a good platform on which to base\r\nour relations with the wild animal world, and by which to regulate\r\nour duty to the creatures that have no means of defense against\r\nthe persecutions of cruel men. They may be regarded as\r\nrepresenting the standards that have been fixed by enlightened and\r\nhumane civilization.\r\n\r\nTHE WILD ANIMALS' BILL OF RIGHTS\r\n\r\nThis Bill of Rights is to be copied and displayed conspicuously\r\nin all zoological parks and gardens, zoos and menageries; in all\r\ntheatres and shows where animal performances are given, and in all\r\nplaces where wild animals and birds are trained, sold or kept for\r\nthe pleasure of their owners.\r\n\r\nArticle 1. In view of the nearness of the approach of the higher\r\nanimals to the human level, no just and humane man can deny that\r\nthose wild animals have certain rights which man is in honor bound\r\nto respect.\r\n\r\nArt. 2. The fact that God gave man \"dominion over the beasts of\r\nthe field\" does not imply a denial of animal rights, any more than\r\nthe supremacy of a human government conveys the right to oppress\r\nand maltreat its citizens.\r\n\r\nArt. 3. Under certain conditions it is justifiable for man to kill\r\na limited number of the so-called game animals, on the same basis\r\nof justification that domestic animals and fowls may be killed for\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nArt. 4. While the trapping of fur-bearing animals is a necessary\r\nevil, that evil must be minimized by reducing the sufferings of\r\ntrapped animals to the lowest possible point, and by preventing\r\nwasteful trapping.\r\n\r\nArt. 5. The killing of harmless mammals or birds solely for\r\n\"sport,\" and without utilizing them when killed, is murder; and no\r\ngood and humane man will permit himself to engage in any such\r\noffenses against good order and the rights of wild creatures.\r\n\r\nArt. 6. Shooting at sea-going creatures from moving vessels,\r\nwithout any possibility of securing them if killed or wounded, is\r\ncruel, reprehensible, and criminal, and everywhere should be\r\nforbidden by ship captains, and also by law, under penalties.\r\n\r\nArt. 7. The extermination of a harmless wild animal species is a\r\ncrime; but the regulated destruction of wild pests that have been\r\nproven guilty, is sometimes necessary and justifiable.\r\n\r\nArt. 8. No group or species of birds or mammals that is accused of\r\noffenses sufficiently grave to merit destruction shall be\r\ncondemned undefended and unheard, nor without adequate evidence of\r\na character which would be acceptable in a court of law.\r\n\r\nArt. 9. The common assumption that every bird or mammal that\r\noffends, or injures the property of any man, is necessarily\r\ndeserving of death, is absurd and intolerable. The death penalty\r\nshould be the last resort, not the first one!\r\n\r\nArt. 10. Any nation that fails adequately to protect its crop-and-\r\ntree-protecting birds deserves to have its fields and forests\r\ndevastated by predatory insects.\r\n\r\nArt. 11. No person has any moral right to keep a wild mammal,\r\nbird, reptile or fish in a state of uncomfortable, unhappy or\r\nmiserable captivity, and all such practices should be prevented by\r\nlaw, under penalty. It is entirely feasible for a judge to\r\ndesignate a competent person as a referee to examine and decide\r\nupon each case.\r\n\r\nArt. 12. A wild creature that cannot be kept in comfortable\r\ncaptivity should not be kept at all; and the evils to be guarded\r\nagainst are cruelly small quarters, too much darkness, too much\r\nlight, uncleanliness, bad odors, and bad food. A fish in a glass\r\nglobe, or a live bird in a cage the size of a collar-box is a case\r\nof cruelty.\r\n\r\nArt. 13. Every captive animal that is suffering hopelessly from\r\ndisease or the infirmities of old age has the right to be\r\npainlessly relieved of the burdens of life.\r\n\r\nArt. 14. Every keeper or owner of a captive wild animal who\r\nthrough indolence, forgetfulness or cruelty permits a wild\r\ncreature in his charge to perish of cold, heat, hunger or thirst\r\nbecause of his negligence, is guilty of a grave misdemeanor, and\r\nhe should be punished as the evidence and the rights of captive\r\nanimals demand.\r\n\r\nArt. 15. An animal in captivity has a right to do all the damage\r\nto its surroundings that it can do, and it is not to be punished\r\ntherefor.\r\n\r\nArt. 16. The idea that all captive wild animals are necessarily\r\n\"miserable\" is erroneous, because some captive animals are better\r\nfed, better protected and are more happy in captivity than similar\r\nanimals are in a wild state, beset by dangers and harassed by\r\nhunger and thirst. It is the opinion of the vast majority of\r\ncivilized people that there is no higher use to which a wild bird\r\nor mammal can be devoted than to place it in perfectly comfortable\r\ncaptivity to be seen by millions of persons who desire to make\r\nits acquaintance.\r\n\r\nArt. 17. About ninety-five per cent of all the wild mammals seen\r\nin captivity were either born in captivity or captured when in\r\ntheir infancy, and therefore have no ideas of freedom, or visions\r\nof their wild homes; consequently their supposed \"pining for\r\nfreedom\" often is more imaginary than real.\r\n\r\nArt. 18. A wild animal has no more inherent right to live a life\r\nof lazy and luxurious ease, and freedom from all care, than a man\r\nor woman has to live without work or family cares. In the large\r\ncities of the world there are many millions of toiling humans who\r\nare worse off per capita as to burdens and sorrows and joys than\r\nare the beasts and birds in a well kept zoological park. \"Freedom\"\r\nis comparative only, not absolute.\r\n\r\nArt. 19. While the use of trained animals in stage performances\r\nis not necessarily cruel, and while training operations are based\r\nchiefly upon kindness and reward, it is necessary that vigilance\r\nshould be exercised to insure that the cages and stage quarters of\r\nsuch animals shall be adequate in size, properly lighted and\r\nacceptably ventilated, and that cruel punishments shall not be\r\ninflicted upon the animals themselves.\r\n\r\nArt. 20. The training of wild animals may, or may not, involve\r\ncruelties, according to the intelligence and the moral status of\r\nthe trainer. This is equally true of the training of children, and\r\nthe treatment of wives and husbands. A reasonable blow with a\r\nwhip to a mean and refractory animal in captivity is not\r\nnecessarily an act of cruelty. Every such act must be judged\r\naccording to the evidence.\r\n\r\nArt. 21. It is unjust to proclaim that \"all wild animal\r\nperformances are cruel\" and therefore should be prohibited by law.\r\nThe claim is untrue, and no lawmaker should pay heed to it. Wild\r\nanimal performances are no more cruel or unjust than men-and-women\r\nperformances of acrobatics. Practically all trained animals are\r\nwell fed and tended, they welcome their performances, and go\r\nthrough them with lively interest. Such performances, when good,\r\nhave a high educational value,--but not to closed minds.\r\n\r\nArt. 22. Every bull-fight, being brutally unfair to the horses and\r\nthe bull engaged and disgustingly cruel, is an unfit spectacle for\r\nhumane and high-minded people, and no Christian man or woman can\r\nattend one without self-stultification.\r\n\r\nArt. 23. The western practice of \"bulldogging,\" now permitted in\r\nsome Wild West shows, is disgusting, degrading, and never should\r\nbe permitted.\r\n\r\nArt. 24. The use of monkeys by organ-grinders is cruel, it is\r\ndegrading to the monkeys, and should in all states be prohibited\r\nby law.\r\n\r\nArt. 25. The keeping of live fishes in glass globes nearly always\r\nends in cruelty and suffering, and should everywhere be prohibited\r\nby law. A round glass straight-jacket is just as painful as any\r\nother kind.\r\n\r\nArt. 26. The sale and use of chained live chameleons as ornaments\r\nand playthings for idiotic or vicious men and children always\r\nmeans death by slow torture for the reptile, and should in all\r\nstates be prohibited by law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. MENTAL TRAITS OF WILD ANIMALS\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTHE BRIGHTEST MINDS AMONG AMERICAN ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe repeat that _the most interesting features of a wild animal\r\nare its mind, its thoughts, and the results of its reasoning._\r\nBesides these, its classification, distribution and anatomy are of\r\nsecondary importance; but at the same time they help to form the\r\nfoundation on which to build the psychology of species and\r\nindividuals. Let no student make the mistake of concluding that\r\nwhen he has learned an animal's place in nature there is nothing\r\nmore to pursue.\r\n\r\nAfter fifty years of practical experience with wild animals of\r\nmany species, I am reluctantly compelled to give the prize for\r\ngreatest cunning and foresight _in self-preservation_ to the\r\ncommon brown rat,--the accursed \"domestic\" rat that has adopted\r\nman as his perpetual servant, and regards man's goods as his\r\nlawful prey. When all other land animals have been exterminated\r\nfrom the earth, the brown rat will remain, to harry and to rob the\r\nLast Man.\r\n\r\nThe brown rat has persistently accompanied man all over the world.\r\nMillions have been spent in fighting him and the bubonic-plague\r\nflea that he cheerfully carries in his offensive fur. For him no\r\nplace _that contains food_ is too hot or too cold, too wet or\r\ntoo dry. Many old sailors claim to believe that rats will desert\r\nat the dock an outward-bound ship that is fated to be lost at sea;\r\nbut that certificate of superhuman foreknowledge needs a backing\r\nof evidence before it can be accepted.\r\n\r\nOf all wild animals, rats do the greatest number of \"impossible\"\r\nthings. We have matched our wits against rat cunning until a\r\nmadhouse yawned before us. Twice in my life all my traps and\r\npoisons have utterly failed, and left me faintly asking:\r\n_Are_ rats possessed of occult powers? Once the answer to\r\nthat was furnished by an old he-one who left his tail in my steel\r\ntrap, but a little later _caught himself_ in a trap-like\r\nspace in the back of the family aeolian, and ignominiously died\r\nthere,--a victim of his own error in judging distances without a\r\ntape line.\r\n\r\nTomes might be written about the minds and manners of the brown\r\nrat, setting forth in detail its wonderful intelligence in quickly\r\ngetting wise to new food, new shelter, new traps and new poisons.\r\nSix dead rats are, as a rule, sufficient to put any _new_\r\ntrap out of business; but poisons and infections go farther before\r\nbeing found out. [Footnote: For home use, my best rat weapon is\r\nrough-on-rats, generously mixed with butter and spread liberally\r\non very thin slices of bread. It has served me well in effecting\r\nclearances.]\r\n\r\nThe championship for keen strategy in self-preservation belongs to\r\nthe musk-oxen for their wolf-proof circle of heads and horns.\r\nEvery musk-ox herd is a mutual benefit life insurance company.\r\nWhen a gaunt and hungry wolf-pack appears, the adult bull and cow\r\nmusk-oxen at once form a close circle, with the calves and young\r\nstock in the centre. That deadly ring of lowered heads and sharp\r\nhorns, all hung precisely right to puncture and deflate hostile\r\nwolves, is impregnable to fang and claw. The arctic wolves know\r\nthis well. Mr. Stefansson says it is the settled habit of wolf\r\npacks of Banks Land to pass musk-ox herds without even provoking\r\nthem to \"fall in\" for defense.\r\n\r\nJudging by the facts that Charles L. Smith and the Norboe brothers\r\nrelated to Mr. Phillips and me around our camp-fires in the\r\nCanadian Rockies, the wolverine is one of the most cunning wild\r\nanimals of all North America. This is a large order; for the gray\r\nwolf and grizzly bear are strong candidates for honors in that\r\ncontest.\r\n\r\nThe greatest cunning of the wolverine is manifested in robbing\r\ntraps, stealing the trapper's food and trap-baits, and at the same\r\ntime avoiding the traps set for him. He is wonderfully expert in\r\nspringing steel traps for the bait or prey there is in them,\r\nwithout getting caught himself. He will follow up a trap line for\r\nmiles, springing all traps and devouring all baits as he goes.\r\nSometimes in sheer wantonness he will throw a trap into a river,\r\nand again he will bury a trap in deep snow. Dead martens in traps\r\nare savagely torn from them. Those that can not be eaten on the\r\nspot are carried off and skilfully cached under two or three feet\r\nof snow.\r\n\r\nTrapper Smith once set a trap for a wolverine, and planted close\r\nbehind it a young moose skull with some flesh upon it. The\r\nwolverine came in the night, started at a point well away from the\r\ntrap, dug a tunnel through six feet of snow, fetched up well\r\nbehind the trap,--and triumphantly dragged away the head through\r\nhis tunnel.\r\n\r\nFrom the testimony of W. H. Wright, of Spokane, in his interesting\r\nbook on \"The Grizzly Bear,\" and for other reasons, I am convinced\r\nthat the Rocky Mountain silver-tip grizzly is our brightest North\r\nAmerican animal, and very keen of nose, eye, ear and brain. Mr.\r\nWright says that \"the grizzly bear far excels in cunning any other\r\nanimal found throughout the Rocky Mountains, and, for that matter,\r\nhe far excels them all combined.\" While the last clause is a large\r\norder, I will not dispute the opinion of a man of keen\r\nintelligence who has lived much among the most important and\r\ninteresting wild animals of the Rockies.\r\n\r\nIn the Bitter Root Mountains Mr. Wright and his hunting party once\r\nset a bear trap for a grizzly, in a pen of logs, well baited with\r\nfresh meat. On the second day they found the pen demolished, the\r\nbait taken out, and everything that was movable piled on the top\r\nof the trap.\r\n\r\nThe trap was again set, this time loosely, under a bed of moss.\r\nThe grizzly came and joyously ate all the meat that was scattered\r\naround the trap, but the moss and the trap were left untouched.\r\nAnd then followed a major operation in bear trapping. A mile away\r\nthere was a steep slope of smooth rock, bounded at its foot by a\r\ncreek. On one side was a huge tangle of down timber, on the other\r\nside loomed some impassable rocks; and a tiny meadow sloped away\r\nat the top. The half-fleshed carcasses of two dead elk were thrown\r\nhalf way down the rock slide, to serve as a bait. On the two sides\r\ntwo bear guns were set, and to their triggers were attached two\r\nlong silk fish-lines, stretched taut and held parallel to each\r\nother, extending across the rocky slope. The idea was that the\r\nbear could not by any possibility reach the bait from above or\r\nbelow, without setting off at least one gun, and getting a bullet\r\nthrough his shoulders.\r\n\r\nOn the first night, no guns went off. The next morning it was\r\nfound that the bear had crossed the stream and climbed straight up\r\ntoward the bait until he reached the first fish-line; where he\r\nstopped. Without pressing the string sufficiently to set off its\r\ngun, he followed it to the barrier of trees. Being balked there,\r\nhe turned about, retraced his steps carefully and followed the\r\nstring to the barrier of rocks. Being blocked there, he back-\r\ntracked down the slide and across the stream, over the way he\r\ncame. Then he widely circled the whole theatre, and came down\r\ntoward the bait from the little meadow at its top of the slide.\r\n\r\nPresently he reached the upper fish-line, twelve feet away from\r\nthe first one. First he followed this out to the log barrier, then\r\nback to the rock ledge that was supposed to be unclimbable. There\r\nhe scrambled up the \"impossible\" rocks, negotiated the ledge foot\r\nby foot, and successfully got around the end of line No. 2.\r\nGetting between the two lines he sailed out across the slope to\r\nthe elk carcasses, feasted sumptuously, and then meandered out\r\nthe way he came, without having disturbed a soul.\r\n\r\nAll this was done at night, and in darkness; and presumably that\r\nbear is there to this day, alive and well. No wonder Mr. Wright\r\nhas a high opinion of the grizzly bear as a thinking animal.\r\n\r\nIn hiding their homes and young, either in burrows or in nests on\r\nthe ground, wild rabbits and hares are wonderfully skilful, even\r\nunder new conditions. Being quite unable to fight, or even to dig\r\ndeeply, they are wholly dependent upon their wits in keeping their\r\nyoung alive by hiding them. Thanks to their keenness in\r\nconcealment, the gray rabbit is plentiful throughout the eastern\r\nUnited States in spite of its millions of enemies. Is it not\r\nwonderful? The number killed by hunters last year in Pennsylvania\r\nwas about 3,500,000!\r\n\r\nThe most amazing risk that I ever saw taken by a rabbit was made\r\nby a gray rabbit that nested in a shallow hole in the middle of a\r\nlawn-mower lawn east of the old National Museum building in\r\nWashington. The hollow was like that of a small wash-basin, and\r\nwhen at rest in it with her young ones the neutral gray back of\r\nthe mother came just level with the top of the ground. At the\r\nlast, when her young were almost large enough to get out and go\r\nunder their own steam, a lawn-mower artist chanced to look down\r\nat the wrong moment and saw the family. Evidently that mother\r\nbelieved that the boldest ventures are those most likely to win.\r\n\r\nAmong the hoofed and horned animals of North America the white-\r\ntailed deer is the shrewdest in the recognition of its enemies,\r\nthe wisest in the choice of cover, and in measures for self-\r\npreservation. It seems at first glance that the buck is more keen-\r\nwitted than the doe; but this is a debatable question. Throughout\r\nthe year the buck thinks only of himself. During fully one-half\r\nthe year the doe is burdened by the cares of motherhood, and the\r\nparamount duty of saving her fawns from their numerous enemies.\r\nThis, I am quite sure, is the handicap which makes it so much\r\neasier to kill a doe in the autumn hunting season than to bag a\r\nfully antlered and sophisticated buck who has only himself to\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\nThe white-tailed deer saves its life by skulking low in timber and\r\nthick brush. This is why it so successfully resists the\r\nextermination that has almost swept the mule deer, antelope,\r\nwhite goat, moose and elk from all the hunting-grounds of the\r\nUnited States. Thanks to its alertness in seeing its enemies\r\nfirst, its skill and quickness in hiding, _and its mental\r\nkeenness in recognizing and using deer sanctuaries,_ the white-\r\ntailed or \"Virginia\" deer will outlive all the other hoofed\r\nanimals of North America. In Pennsylvania they know enough to rush\r\nfor the wire-bounded protected area whenever the hunters appear.\r\nThat state has twenty-six such deer sanctuaries,--well filled\r\nwith deer.\r\n\r\nThe moose and caribou dwell upon open or half-open ground, and are\r\nat the mercy of the merciless long-range rifles. Their keenness\r\ndoes not count much against rifles that can shoot and kill at a\r\nquarter of a mile. In the rutting season the bull moose of Maine\r\nor New Brunswick is easily deceived by the \"call\" of a birch-bark\r\nmegaphone in the hands of a moose hunter who imitates the love\r\ncall of the cow moose so skilfully that neither moose nor man can\r\ndetect the falsity of the lure.\r\n\r\nThe mountain sheep is wide-eyed, alert and ready to run, but he\r\ndwells in exposed places from the high foothills up to the\r\nmountain summits, and now even the most bungling hunter can find\r\nhim and kill him at long range. In the days of black powder and\r\nshort ranges the sheep had a chance to escape; but now he has none\r\nwhatever. He has keener vision and more alertness than the goat,\r\nbut as a real life-saving factor that amounts to nothing! Wild\r\nsheep are easily and quickly exterminated.\r\n\r\nThe mountain goat has no protection except elevation and\r\nprecipitous rocks, and to the hunter who has the energy to climb\r\nup to him he, too, is easy prey. Usually his biped enemy finds him\r\nand attacks him in precipitous mountains, where running and hiding\r\nare utterly impossible. When discovered on a ledge two feet wide\r\nleading across the face of a precipice, poor Billy has nothing to\r\ndo but to take the bullets as they come until he reels and falls\r\nfar down to the cruel slide-rock. He has a wonderful mind, but its\r\nqualities and its usefulness belong in Chapter XIII.\r\n\r\nWarm-Coated Animals Avoid \"Fresh Air.\" On this subject there is a\r\nstrange divergence of reasoning power between the wild animals of\r\ncold countries and the sleeping-porch advocates of today.\r\n\r\nEven the most warm-coated of the fur-bearing animals, such as the\r\nbears, foxes, beavers, martens and mink, and also the burrowing\r\nrodents, take great pains to den up in winter just as far from the\r\n\"fresh air\" of the cold outdoors as they can attain by deep\r\ndenning or burrowing. The prairie-dog not only ensconces himself\r\nin a cul-de-sac at the end of a hole fourteen feet deep and long,\r\nbut as winter sets in he also tightly plugs up the mouth of his\r\nden with moist earth. When sealed up in his winter den the black\r\nbear of the north draws his supply of fresh air through a hole\r\nabout one inch in diameter, or less.\r\n\r\nBut the human devotees of fresh air reason in the opposite\r\ndirection. It is now the regular thing for mothers to open wide to\r\nthe freezing air of out-doors either one or all the windows of the\r\nrooms in which their children sleep, giving to each child enough\r\nfresh air to supply ten full-grown elephants, or twenty head of\r\nhorses. And the final word is the \"sleeping-porch!\" It matters not\r\nhow deadly damp is the air along with its 33 degrees of cold, or\r\nthe velocity of the wind, the fresh air must be delivered. The\r\nexample of the fat and heavily furred wild beast is ignored; and I\r\njust wonder how many people in the United States, old and young,\r\nhave been killed, or permanently injured, by fresh air, during the\r\nlast fifteen years.\r\n\r\nAnd furthermore. Excepting the hoofed species, it is the universal\r\nrule of the wild animals of the cold-winter zones of the earth\r\nthat the mother shall keep her helpless young close beside her in\r\nthe home nest and keep them warm partly by the warmth of her own\r\nbody. The wild fur-clad mother does not maroon her helpless\r\noffspring in an isolated cot in a room apart, upon a thin mattress\r\nand in an atmosphere so cold that it is utterly impossible for the\r\npoor little body and limbs to warm it and keep it warm. Yet many\r\nhuman mothers do just that, and some take good care to provide a\r\nwarmer atmosphere for themselves than they joyously force upon\r\ntheir helpless infants.\r\n\r\nNo dangerous fads should be forced upon defenseless children or\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nA proper amount of fresh air is very desirable, but the intake of\r\na child is much less than that of an elephant. Besides, if Nature\r\nhad intended that men should sleep outdoors in winter, with the\r\nmoose and caribou, we would have been furnished with ruminant\r\npelage and fat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nKEEN BIRDS AND DULL MEN\r\n\r\n\r\nIf all men could know how greatly the human species varies from\r\nhighest to lowest, and how the minds and emotions of the lowest\r\nmen parallel and dove-tail with those of the highest quadrupeds\r\nand birds, we might be less obsessed with our own human ego, and\r\nmore appreciative of the intelligence of animals.\r\n\r\nA thousand times in my life my blood has been brought to the\r\nboiling point by seeing or reading of the cruel practices of\r\nignorant and vicious men toward animals whom they despised because\r\nof their alleged standing \"below man.\" By his vicious and cruel\r\nnature, many a man is totally unfitted to own, or even to\r\nassociate with, dogs, horses and monkeys. Many persons are born\r\ninto the belief that every man is necessarily a \"lord of\r\ncreation,\" and that all animals per se are man's lawful prey. In\r\nthe vicious mind that impression increases with age. Minds of the\r\nbetter classes can readily learn by precept or by reasoning from\r\ncause to effect the duty of man to observe and defend the God-\r\ngiven rights of animals.\r\n\r\nIt was very recently that I saw on the street a group that\r\nrepresented man's attitude toward wild animals. It consisted of\r\nan unclean and vicious-looking man in tramp's clothing, grinding\r\nan offensive hand-organ and domineering over a poor little\r\nterrorized \"ringtail\" monkey. The wretched mite from the jungle\r\nwas encased in a heavy woolen straight-jacket, and there was a\r\nstrap around its loins to which a stout cord was attached, running\r\nto the Root of All Evil. The pavement was hot, but there with its\r\nbare and tender feet on the hot concrete, the sad-eyed little waif\r\npainfully moved about, peering far up into the faces of passers-by\r\nfor sympathy, but all the time furtively and shrinkingly watching\r\nits tormentor. Every now and then the hairy old tramp would jerk\r\nthe monkey's cord, each time giving the frail creature a violent\r\nbodily wrench from head to foot. I think that string was jerked\r\nabout forty times every hour.\r\n\r\nAnd that exhibition of monkey torture in a monkey hell continues\r\nin summer throughout many states of our country,--because \"it\r\npleases the children!\" The use of monkeys with hand-organs is a\r\ncruel outrage upon the monkey tribe, and no civilized state or\r\nmunicipality should tolerate it. I call upon all humane persons to\r\nput an end to it.\r\n\r\nAs an antidote to our vaulting human egotism, we should think\r\noften upon the closeness of mental contact between the highest\r\nanimals and the lowest men. In drawing a parallel between those\r\ntwo groups, there are no single factors more valuable than the\r\nhome, and the family food supply. These hark back to the most\r\nprimitive instincts of the vertebrates. They are the bedrock\r\nfoundations upon which every species rests. As they are stable or\r\nunstable, good or bad, so lives or dies the individual, and the\r\nspecies also.\r\n\r\nIn employing the term \"highest animals\" I wish to be understood as\r\nreferring to the warm-blooded vertebrates, and not merely the apes\r\nand monkeys that both structurally and mentally are nearest to\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThroughout my lifetime I have been by turns amazed, entertained\r\nand instructed by the marvelous intelligence and mechanical skill\r\nof small mammals in constructing burrows, and of certain birds in\r\nthe construction of their nests. Today the hanging nest of the\r\nBaltimore oriole is to me an even greater wonder than it was when\r\nI first saw one over sixty years ago. Even today the mechanical\r\nskill involved in its construction is beyond my comprehension. My\r\ndull brain can not figure out the processes by which the bird\r\nbegins to weave its hanging purse at the tip end of the most\r\nunstable of all earthly building sites,--a down-hanging elm-tree\r\nbranch that is swayed to and fro by every passing breeze. The\r\nsituation is so \"impossible\" that thus far no moving picture\r\nartist has ever caught and recorded the process.\r\n\r\nTake in your hand a standard oriole nest, and examine it\r\nthoroughly. First you will note that it is very strong, and\r\nthoroughly durable. It can stand the lashings of the fiercest\r\ngales that visit our storm-beaten shore.\r\n\r\nHow long would it take a man to unravel that nest, wisp by wisp,\r\nand resolve it into a loose pile of materials? Certainly not less\r\nthan an entire day. Do you think that even your skilful fingers,--\r\nunassisted by needles,--could in two days, or in three, weave of\r\nthose same materials a nest like that, that would function as did\r\nthe original? I doubt it. The materials consist of long strips of\r\nthe thin inner bark of trees, short strings, and tiny grass stems\r\nthat are long, pliable and tough. Who taught the oriole how to\r\nfind and to weave those rare and hard-to-find materials? And how\r\ndid it manage all that weaving with its beak only? Let the wise\r\nones answer, if they can; for I confess that I can not!\r\n\r\nDown in Venezuela, in the delta of the Orinoco River, and\r\nelsewhere, lives a black and yellow bird called the giant cacique\r\n(pronounced cay-seek'), which as a nest-builder far surpasses our\r\noriole. Often the cacique's hanging nest is from four to six feet\r\nlong. The oriole builds to escape the red squirrels, but the\r\ncacique has to reckon with the prehensile-tailed monkeys.\r\n\r\nSometimes a dozen caciques will hang their nests in close\r\nproximity to a wasps' nest, as if for additional protection. A\r\ncacique's nest hangs like a grass rope, with a commodious purse at\r\nits lower end, entered by a narrow perpendicular slit a foot or so\r\nabove the terminal facilities. It is impossible to achieve one of\r\nthese nests without either shooting off the limb to which it\r\nhangs, or felling the tree. If it hangs low enough a charge of\r\ncoarse shot usually will cut the limb, but if high, cutting it down\r\nwith a rifle bullet is a more serious matter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration with caption: HANGING NEST OF THE BALTIMORE ORIOLE\r\n(From the \"American Natural History\")]\r\n\r\n[Illustration with caption: GREAT HANGING NESTS OF THE CRESTED\r\nCACIQUE As seen in the delta of the Orinoco Rover, Venezuela.]\r\n\r\nTo our Zoological Park visitors the African weaver birds are a\r\nwonder and a delight. Orioles and caciques do not build nests in\r\ncaptivity, but the weavers blithely transfer their activities to\r\ntheir spacious cage in our tropical-bird house. The bird-men keep\r\nthem supplied with raffia grass, and they do the rest. Fortunately\r\nfor us, they weave nests for fun, and work at it all the year\r\nround! Millions of visitors have watched them doing it. To\r\nfacilitate their work the upper half of their cage is judiciously\r\nsupplied with tree-branches of the proper size and architectural\r\nslant. The weaving covers many horizontal branches. Sometimes a\r\ngroup of nests will be tied together in a structure four feet\r\nlong; and it branches up, or down, or across, seemingly without\r\nrhyme or reason.\r\n\r\nSome of the weavers, which inhabit Africa, Malayana and Australia,\r\nare \"communal\" nest-builders. They build colonies of nests, close\r\ntogether. Imagine twenty-five or more Baltimore orioles massing\r\ntheir nests together on one side of a single tree, in a genuine\r\nvillage. That is the habit of some of the weaver birds;--and this\r\nbrings us to what is called the most wonderful of all\r\nmanifestations of house-building intelligence among birds. It is\r\nthe community house of the little sociable weaver-bird of South\r\nAfrica (_Philetoerus socius_). Having missed seeing the work\r\nof this species save in museums, I will quote from the Royal\r\nNatural History, written by the late Dr. Richard Lydekker, an\r\nexcellent description: --This species congregates in large flocks,\r\nmany pairs incubating their eggs under the same roof, which is\r\ncomposed of cartloads of grass piled on a branch of some camel-\r\nthorn tree in one enormous mass of an irregular umbrella shape,\r\nlooking like a miniature haystack and almost solid, but with the\r\nunder surface (which is nearly flat) honeycombed all over with\r\nlittle cavities, which serve not only as places for incubation,\r\nbut also as a refuge against rain and wind.\r\n\r\n\"They are constantly being repaired by their active little\r\ninhabitants. It is curious that even the initiated eye is\r\nconstantly being deceived by these dome-topped structures, since\r\nat a distance they closely resemble native huts. The nesting-\r\nchambers themselves are warmly lined with feathers.\"\r\n\r\nHere must we abruptly end our exhibits of the intelligence of a\r\nfew humble little birds as fairly representative of the wonderful\r\nmental ability and mechanical skill so common in the ranks of the\r\nbirds of the world. It would be quite easy to write a volume on\r\nThe Architectural Skill of Birds!\r\n\r\nNow, let us look for a moment into the house-building intelligence\r\nand skill of some of the lower tribes of men. Out of the multitude\r\nof exhibits available I will limit myself to three, widely\r\nseparated. In the first place, the habitations of the savage and\r\nbarbaric tribes are usually the direct result of their own mental\r\nand moral deficiencies. The Eskimo is an exception, because his\r\nhome and its location are dictated by the hard and fierce\r\ncircumstances which dictate to him what he must do. Often he is\r\ncompelled to move as his food supply moves. The Cliff-Dweller\r\nIndian of the arid regions of the Southwest was forced to cliff-\r\ndwell, in order to stave off extermination by his enemies. Under\r\nthat spur he became a wonderful architect and engineer.\r\n\r\nFor present purposes we are concerned with three savage tribes\r\nwhich might have been rich and prosperous agriculturists or\r\nherdsmen had they developed sufficient intelligence to see the\r\nwisdom of regular industry.\r\n\r\nConsider first the lowest of three primitive tribes that inhabit\r\nthe extreme southern point of Patagonia, whose real estate\r\nholdings front on the Strait of Magellan. That region is treeless,\r\nrocky, windswept, cold and inhospitable. I can not imagine a place\r\nbetter fitted for an anarchist penal colony. North of it lie\r\nplains less rigorous, and by degrees less sterile, and finally\r\nthere are lands quite habitable by cattle-and-crop-growing men.\r\n\r\nBut those three tribes elect to stick to the worst spot in South\r\nAmerica. The most primitive is the tribe of \"canoe Indians\" of\r\nTierra del Fuego, which probably represents the lowest rung of the\r\nhuman ladder. Beside them the cave men of 30,000 years ago were\r\nkings and princes. Their only rivals seem to be the Poonans of\r\nCentral Borneo, who, living in a hot country, make no houses or\r\nshelters of any kind, and have no clothing but a long strip of\r\nbark cloth around the loins.\r\n\r\nThe Fuegians have long been known to mariners and travellers. They\r\ninhabit a region that half the year is bleak, cold and raw, but\r\nthey make nothing save the rudest of the rude in canoes--of rough\r\nslabs tied together and caulked _with moss,_--and rough bone-\r\npointed spears, bows, arrows and paddles. Their only clothing\r\nconsists of skins of the guanacos loosely hung from the neck, and\r\nflapping over the naked and repulsive body. They make no houses,\r\nand on shore their only shelters from the wind and snow and\r\nchilling rains are rabbit-like forms of brush, broken off by hand.\r\n\r\nThese people are lower in the scale of intelligence than any wild\r\nanimal species known to me; for they are mentally too dull and low\r\nto maintain themselves on a continuing basis. Their hundred years\r\nof contact with man has taught them little; and numerically they\r\nare decreasing so rapidly that the world will soon see the\r\nabsolute finish of the tribe.\r\n\r\nIn the best of the three tribes, the Tchuelclus, the birth rate is\r\nso low that within recent times the tribe has diminished from\r\nabout 5,000 to a remnant of about 500.\r\n\r\nNow, have those primitive creatures \"immortal souls?\" Are they\r\nentitled to call chimpanzees, elephants, bears and dogs \"lower\r\nanimals?\" Do they \"think,\" or \"reason,\" any more than the animals\r\nI have named?\r\n\r\nIt is a far cry from the highest to the lowest of the human race;\r\nand we hold that the highest animals intellectually are higher\r\nthan the lowest men.\r\n\r\nNow go with me for a moment to the lofty and dense tropical forest\r\nin the heart of the Territory of Selangor, in the Malay Peninsula.\r\nThat forest is the home of the wild elephant, rhinoceros and\r\nsladang. And there dwells a jungle tribe called the Jackoons, some\r\nmembers of which I met at their family home, and observed\r\nliterally in their own ancestral tree. Their house was not wholly\r\nbad, but it might have been 100 per cent better. It was merely a\r\nplatform of small poles, placed like a glorified bird's nest in\r\nthe spreading forks of a many-branched tree, about twenty feet\r\nfrom the ground. The main supports were bark-lashed to the large\r\nbranches of the family tree. Over this there was a rude roof of\r\nlong grass, which had a fairly intelligent slope. As a shelter\r\nfrom rain, the Jackoon house left much to be desired. The scanty\r\nloin cloths of the habitants knew no such thing as wash-day or\r\nline. With all its drawbacks, however, this habitation was far\r\nmore adequate to the needs of its builders than the cold brush\r\nrabbit-forms of the Patagonian canoe Indians.\r\n\r\nWe now come to a tribe which has reduced the problem of housing\r\nand home life to its lowest common denominator. The Poonans of\r\nCentral Borneo, discovered and described by Carl Bock, build _no\r\nhouses of any kind,_ not even huts of green branches; and their\r\nonly overture toward the promotion of personal comfort in the home\r\nis a five-foot grass mat spread upon the sodden earth, to lie upon\r\nwhen at rest. And this, in a country where in the so-called \"dry\r\nseason\" it rains half the time, and in the \"wet season\" all the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe Poonans have rudely-made spears for taking the wild pig, deer\r\nand smaller game, their clothes consist of bark cloth, around the\r\nloins only. They know no such thing as agriculture, and they live\r\noff the jungle.\r\n\r\nIt was said some years ago that a similarly primitive jungle tribe\r\nof Ceylon, known as the Veddahs, could count no more than five,\r\nthat they could not comprehend \"day after to-morrow,\" and that\r\ntheir vocabulary was limited to about 200 words.\r\n\r\nIt is very probable that the language of the Poonans and the\r\nJackoons is equally limited. And what are we to conclude from\r\nall the foregoing? Briefly, I should say that the architectural\r\nskill of the orioles, the caciques and the weaver birds is greater\r\nthan that of the South Patagonia native, the Jackoon and the\r\nPoonan. I should say that those bird homes yield to their makers\r\nmore comfort and protection, and a better birth-rate, than are\r\nyielded by the homes of those ignorant, unambitious and\r\nretrogressive tribes of men now living and thinking, and supposed\r\nto be possessed of reasoning powers. If the whole truth could be\r\nknown, I believe it would be found that the stock of ideas\r\npossessed and used by the groups of highly-endowed birds would\r\nfully equal the ideas of such tribes of simple-minded men as those\r\nmentioned. If caught young, those savages could be trained by\r\ncivilized men, and taught to perform many tricks, but so can\r\nchimpanzees and elephants.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, it is a common thing for even the higher types\r\nof civilized men to make in home-building just as serious mistakes\r\nas are made by wild animals and savages. For example, among the\r\nmen of our time it is a common mistake to build in the wrong\r\nplace, to build entirely too large or too ugly, and to build a\r\nColossal Burden instead of a real Home. From many a palace there\r\nstands forth the perpetual question: \"_Why_ did he do it?\"\r\n\r\nAny reader who at any time inclines toward an opinion that the\r\nauthor is unduly severe on the mentality of the human race, even\r\nas it exists today in the United States, is urged to read in the\r\n_Scientific Monthly_ for January, 1922, an article by\r\nProfessor L. M. Tennan entitled \"Adventures in Stupidity.--A\r\nPartial Analysis of the Intellectual Inferiority of a College\r\nStudent.\" He should particularly note the percentages on page 34\r\nin the second paragraph under the subtitle \"The Psychology of\r\nStupidity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nTHE MENTAL STATUS OF THE ORANG-UTAN\r\n\r\n\r\nMy first ownership of a live orang-utan began in 1878, in the\r\nmiddle of the Simujan River, Borneo, where for four Spanish\r\ndollars I became the proud possessor of a three-year old male. No\r\nsooner was the struggling animal deposited in the bottom of my own\r\nboat than it savagely seized the calf of my devoted leg and\r\nendeavored to bite therefrom a generous cross section. My leggings\r\nand my leech stockings saved my life. That implacable little beast\r\nnever gave up; and two days later it died,--apparently to spite\r\nme.\r\n\r\nMy next orang was a complete reverse of No. 1. He liked not the\r\nDyaks who brought him to me, but in the first moment of our\r\nacquaintance he adopted me as his foster-father, and loved me like\r\na son. Throughout four months of jungle vicissitudes he stuck to\r\nme. He was a high-class orang,--and be it known that many orangs\r\nare thin-headed scrubs, who never amount to anything. His skull\r\nwas wide, his face was broad, and he had a dome of thought like a\r\nstatesman. He had a fine mind, and I am sure I could have taught\r\nhim everything that any ape could learn.\r\n\r\nDuring the four months that he lived with me I taught him, almost\r\nwithout effort, many things that were necessary in our daily life.\r\nEven the Dyaks recognized the fact that the \"Old Man\" was an orang\r\n(or \"mias\") of superior mind, and some of them traveled far to see\r\nhim. Unfortunately the exigencies of travel and work compelled me\r\nto present him to an admiring friend in India. Mr. Andrew Carnegie\r\nand his then partner, Mr. J. W. Vandevorst, convoyed my Old Man\r\nand another small orang from Singapore to Colombo, Ceylon, whence\r\nthey were shipped on to Madras, received there by my old friend A.\r\nG. R. Theobald,--and presented at the court of the Duke of\r\nBuckingham.\r\n\r\nUp to a comparatively recent date, the studies of the\r\npsychologists that have been devoted to the minds of animals below\r\nman, have been chiefly concerned with low and common types.\r\nComparatively few investigators have found it possible to make\r\nextensive and prolonged observations of the most intelligent wild\r\nanimals of the world, even in zoological gardens, and their\r\nobservations on wild animals in a state of nature seem to have\r\nbeen even more circumscribed. I know only three who have studied\r\nany of the great apes.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to fathom the mental capacity and the mental\r\nprocesses of some of the highest mammals, there is the same\r\nsuperior degree of interest attaching to the study of wild species\r\nthat the ethnologist finds in the study of savage races of men\r\nthat have been unspoiled by civilization. Obviously, it is more\r\ninteresting to fathom the mind of a creature in an absolute state\r\nof nature than of one whose ancestors have been bred and reared in\r\nthe trammels of domestication and for many successive generations\r\nhave bowed to the will of man. The natural fury of the Atlantic\r\nwalrus, when attacked, is much more interesting as a psychologic\r\nstudy than is the inbred rage of the bull-dog; and the remarkable\r\ndefensive tactics of the musk-ox far surpass in interest the\r\nvagaries of range cattle.\r\n\r\nFor several reasons, the great apes, and particularly the\r\nchimpanzees and orang-utans, are the most interesting subjects for\r\npsychologic study of all the wild-animal species with which the\r\nwriter is acquainted. Primarily this is due to the fact that\r\nintellectually and temperamentally, as well as anatomically,\r\nthese animals stand very near to man himself, and closely resemble\r\nhim. The great apes mentioned can give visible expression to a\r\nwide range of thoughts and emotions,\r\n\r\nThe voice of the adult orang-utan is almost absent, and only\r\nsufficient to display on rare occasions. What little there is of\r\nit, in animals over six years of age, is very deep and guttural,\r\nand may best be described as a deep-bass roar. Under excitement\r\nthe orang can produce a roar by inhalation. Young orangs under two\r\nyears of age often whine, or shriek or scream with anger, like\r\nexcited human children, but with their larger growth that vocal\r\npower seems to leave them.\r\n\r\nDespite the difference in temperament and quickness in delivery, I\r\nregard the measure of the orang-utan's mental capacity as being\r\nequal to that of the chimpanzee; but the latter is, and always\r\nwill remain, the more alert and showy animal. The superior feet of\r\nthe chimpanzee in bipedal work is for that species a great\r\nadvantage, and the longer toes of the orang are a handicap.\r\nAlthough the orang's sanguine temperament is far more comforting\r\nto a trainer than the harum-scarum nervous vivacity of the\r\nchimpanzee, the value of the former is overbalanced, on the stage,\r\nby the superior acting of the chimp. For these reasons the\r\ntrainers generally choose the chimp for stage education.\r\n\r\nThe chimpanzee is not only nervous and quick in thought and in\r\naction, but it is equally so _in temper._ It will play with\r\nany good friend to almost any extent, but the moment it suspects\r\nmalicious unfairness, or what it regards as a \"mean trick,\" it\r\ninstantly becomes angry and resentful. Once when I attempted to\r\ntake from our large black-faced chimpanzee, called Soko, a small\r\nlump of rubber which I feared she might swallow, my efforts were\r\nkindly but firmly thwarted. At last, when I diverted her by small\r\nofferings of chocolate, and at the right moment sought by a\r\nstrategic movement to snatch the rubber from her, the palpable\r\nunfairness of the attempt caused the animal instantly to fly into\r\na towering passion, and seek to wreak vengeance upon me. Her lips\r\ndrew far back in a savage snarl, and she denounced my perfidy by\r\npiercing cries of rage and indignation. She also did her utmost to\r\nseize and drag me forcibly within reach of her teeth, for the\r\npunishment which she felt that I deserved.\r\n\r\nA large male orang-utan named Dohong, under a similar test,\r\nrevealed a very different mental attitude. He dexterously snatched\r\na valuable watch-charm from a visitor who stood inside the railing\r\nof his cage, and fled with it to the top of his balcony. As\r\nquickly as possible I thrust my handkerchief between the bars, and\r\nwaved it vigorously, to attract him. At once the animal came down\r\nto me, to secure another trophy, and before he realized his\r\nposition I successfully snatched the charm from him, and restored\r\nit unharmed to its owner. Dohong seemed to regard the episode as a\r\ngood joke. Without manifesting any resentment he turned a\r\nsomersault on his straw, then climbed upon his trapeze and began\r\nto perform, as if nothing in particular had occurred.\r\n\r\nThe orang is distinctly an animal of more serene temper and more\r\nphilosophic mind than the chimpanzee. This has led some authors\r\nerroneously to pronounce the orang an animal of morose and\r\nsluggish disposition, and mentally inferior to the chimpanzee.\r\nAfter a close personal acquaintance with about forty captive\r\norangs of various sizes, I am convinced that the facts do not\r\nwarrant that conclusion. The orang-utans of the New York\r\nZoological Park certainly have been as cheerful in disposition, as\r\nfond of exercise and as fertile in droll performances as our\r\nchimpanzees. Even though the mind of the chimpanzee does act more\r\nquickly than that of its rival, and even though its movements are\r\nusually more rapid and more precise, the mind of the orang carries\r\nthat animal precisely as far. Moreover, in its native jungles the\r\norang habitually builds for itself a very comfortable nest on\r\nwhich to rest and sleep, which the chimpanzee ordinarily does not\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nI think that the exact mental status of an anthropoid ape is best\r\nrevealed by an attempt to train it to do some particular thing, in\r\na manner that the trainer elects. Usually about five lessons,\r\ncarefully observed, will afford a good index of the pupil's mental\r\ncapabilities. Some chimpanzees are too nervous to be taught, some\r\nare too obstinate, and others are too impatient of restraint. Some\r\norang-utans are hopelessly indifferent to the business in hand,\r\nand refuse to become interested in it. I think that no orang is\r\ntoo dull to learn to sit at a table, and eat with the utensils\r\nthat are usually considered sacred to man's use, but the majority\r\nof them care only for the food, and take no interest in the\r\nfunction. On the other hand, the average chimpanzee is as restless\r\nas a newly-caught eel, and its mind is dominated by a desire to\r\nclimb far beyond the reach of restraining hands, and to do almost\r\nanything save that which is particularly desired.\r\n\r\nAmong the twenty or more orangs which up to 1922 have been\r\nexhibited in the Zoological Park, two stand out with special\r\nprominence, by reason of their unusual mental qualities. They\r\ndiffered widely from each other. One was a born actor and\r\nimitator, who loved human partnership in his daily affairs. The\r\nother was an original thinker and reasoner, with a genius for\r\ninvention, and at all times impatient of training and restraint.\r\nThe first was named Rajah, the latter was called Dohong.\r\n\r\nRajah was a male orang, and about four years of age when received\r\nby us. His high and broad forehead, large eyes and general breadth\r\nof cranium and jaw marked him at once as belonging to the higher\r\ncaste of orangs. Dealers and experts have no difficulty in\r\nrecognizing at one glance an orang that has a good brain and good\r\ngeneral physique from those which are thin-headed, narrow-jawed,\r\nweak in body and unlikely to live long.\r\n\r\nAt the Zoological Park we have tested out the orang-utan's\r\nsusceptibility to training, and proven that the task is so simple\r\nand easy that even amateurs can accomplish much in a short time.\r\nDesiring that several of our orangs should perform in public, we\r\ninstructed the primate keepers to proceed along certain lines and\r\neducate them to that idea. Naturally, the performance was laid out\r\nto match our own possibilities. In a public park, where only a\r\nvery little time can be devoted to training, we do not linger long\r\nover an animal that is either stupid or obstinate. Those which\r\ncannot be trained easily and quickly are promptly set aside as\r\nineligible.\r\n\r\nWithout any great amount of labor, and with no real difficulty,\r\nour orangs were trained to perform the following simple acts:\r\n\r\n1. To sit at table, and eat and drink like humans. This involved\r\neating sliced bananas with a fork, pouring out milk from a teapot\r\ninto a teacup, drinking out of a teacup, drinking out of a beer-\r\nbottle, using a toothpick, striking a match, lighting a cigarette,\r\nsmoking and spitting like a man.\r\n\r\n2. To ride a tricycle, or bicycle.\r\n\r\n3. To put on a pair of trousers, adjust the suspenders, put on a\r\nsweater or coat, and a cap, reversing the whole operation after\r\nthe performance.\r\n\r\n4. To drive nails with a hammer.\r\n\r\n5. Use a key to lock and unlock a padlock. The animal most\r\nproficient in this became able to select the right Yale key out of\r\na bunch of half a dozen or more, with as much quickness and\r\nprecision as the average man displays.\r\n\r\nThe orang Dohong learned to pedal and to guide a tricycle in about\r\nthree lessons. He caught the two ideas almost instantly, and soon\r\nbrought his muscles under control sufficiently to ride\r\nsuccessfully, even under difficult conditions.\r\n\r\nIt was quickly recognized that our Rajah was a particularly good\r\nsubject, and with him the keepers went farther than with the four\r\nothers. From the first moment, the training operations were to him\r\nboth interesting and agreeable. The animal enjoyed the work, and\r\nhe entered into it so heartily that in two weeks he was ready to\r\ndine in public, somewhat after the manner of human beings.\r\n\r\nA platform eight feet in height was erected in front of the\r\nReptile House, and upon it were placed a table, a high chair such\r\nas small children use, and various dishes. To the platform a step-\r\nladder led upward from the ground. Every day at four o'clock lusty\r\nRajah was carried to the exhibition space, and set free upon the\r\nground. Forthwith the keepers proceeded to dress him in trousers,\r\nvest, coat and cap. The moment the last button had been fastened\r\nand the cap placed upon his head, he would promptly walk to the\r\nladder, climb up to the platform, and in the most business-like\r\nway imaginable, seat himself in his chair at the table, all ready\r\nto dine.\r\n\r\nHe used a napkin, ate his soup with a spoon, speared and conveyed\r\nhis sliced bananas with his fork, poured milk from a teapot into\r\nhis teacup, and drank from his cup with great enjoyment and\r\ndecorum. When he took a drink (of tea) from a suspicious-looking\r\nblack bottle, the audience always laughed. When he elevated the\r\nempty bottle to one eye and looked far into it, they roared; and\r\nwhen he finally took a toothpick and gravely placed it in his\r\nmouth, his auditors were delighted. Several times during the\r\nprogress of each meal, Rajah would pause and benignly gaze down\r\nupon the crowd, like a self-satisfied judge on his bench.\r\n\r\nNot once did Rajah spoil this exhibition, which was continued\r\nthroughout an entire summer, nor commit any overt act of\r\nimpatience, indifference or meanness. The flighty, nervous temper\r\nof the chimpanzee was delightfully absent. The most remarkable\r\nfeature of it all was his very evident enjoyment of his part of\r\nthe performance, and his sense of responsibility to us and to his\r\naudiences.\r\n\r\nRajah easily and quickly learned to ride a tricycle, and guide it\r\nhimself. But for his untimely death, through a remarkable invasion\r\nof a microscopic parasite (_Balentidium coli_) imported from\r\nthe Galapagos Islands by elephant tortoises, his mind would have\r\nbeen developed much farther. Since his death, in 1902, we have had\r\nother orang-utans that were successfully taught to dine, but none\r\nof them entered into the business with the same hearty zest which\r\ncharacterized Rajah, and made his performances so interesting.\r\n\r\nWe now come to a consideration of simian mental traits of very\r\ndifferent character. Another male orang, named Dohong, of the\r\nsame age and intellectual caste as Rajah, developed a faculty for\r\nmechanics and invention which not only challenged our admiration,\r\nbut also created much work for our carpenters. He discovered, or\r\ninvented,  as you please, the lever as a mechanical force,--as fairly\r\nand squarely as Archimedes discovered the principle of the screw.\r\nMoreover, he delighted in the use of the new power thus acquired,\r\nquite as much as the successful inventor usually does. At the same\r\ntime, two very bright chimpanzees of his own age, and with the\r\nsame opportunities, discovered nothing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration caption: THUMB-PRINT OF AN ORANG-UTAN\r\nA group of fourteen experts in the New York City Departement of\r\nCriminal Records were unable to recognise this thumb print as\r\nanything else than that of a man]\r\n\r\n[Illustration caption: \"RAJAH,\" THE ACTOR ORANG-UTAN\r\nIn three lessons he learned to ride a tricycle]\r\n\r\nDohong was of a reflective turn of mind, and never was entirely\r\nwilling to learn the things that his keepers sought to teach him.\r\nTo him, dining at a table was tiresomely dull, and the donning of\r\nfashionable clothing was a frivolous pastime, On the other hand,\r\nthe interior of his cage, and his gymnastic appliances of ropes,\r\ntrapeze and horizontal bars, all interested him greatly. Every\r\nsquare inch of surface, and every piece of material in his\r\napartment, was carefully investigated, many times over.\r\n\r\nWhen three years old he discovered his own strength, and at first\r\nhe used it good-naturedly to hector his cage-mate, a female\r\nchimpanzee smaller than himself. That, however, was of trifling\r\ninterest. The day on which he made the discovery that he could\r\nbreak the wooden one and one-half inch horizontal bars that were\r\nheld out from his cage walls on cast iron brackets, was for him a\r\ngreat day. Before his discovery was noted by the keepers he had\r\njoyfully destroyed two bars, and with a broken piece used as a\r\nlever was attacking a third. These bars were promptly replaced by\r\nlarger bars, of harder wood, but screwed to the same cast-iron\r\nbrackets that had carried the first series.\r\n\r\nFor a time, the heavier bars endured; but in an evil moment the\r\nape swung his trapeze bar, of two-inch oak, far over to one side\r\nof his cage, and applied the bar as a lever, inside of a\r\nhorizontal bar and from above. The new force was too much for the\r\ncast-iron brackets, and one by one they gave way. Some were broken\r\noff, and others were torn from the wall by the breaking of the\r\nscrews that held them. Knowing that all those brackets\r\nmust be changed immediately, Dohong was left to destroy them;\r\nwhich he did, promptly and joyfully. We then made heavy\r\nbrackets of flat wrought iron bars, 1/2 by 21/2 inches, unbreakable\r\neven with a lever. These were screwed on with screws\r\nso large and heavy that our carpenters knew they were quite\r\nsecure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration caption: THE LEVER THAT OUR ORANG-UTAN INVENTED, AND\r\nTHE WAY HE APPLIED IT By W. A. Camadeo, in the \"Scientific\r\nAmerican,\" 1907]\r\n\r\nIn due time, Dohong tested his lever upon the bars with their new\r\nbrackets, and at first they held securely. Then he engaged Polly,\r\nhis chimpanzee companion, to assist him to the limit of her\r\nstrength. While Dohong pulled on the lever, Polly braced her\r\nabsurd little back against the wall, and pushed upon it, with all\r\nher strength. At first nothing gave way. The combined strength\r\nexerted by the three brackets was not to be overcome by prying at\r\nthe horizontal bar itself. It was then that Dohong's inventive\r\ngenius rose to its climax. He decided to attack the brackets\r\nsingly, and conquer them one by one. On examining the situation\r\nvery critically, he found that each bracket consisted of a right-\r\nangled triangle of wrought iron, with its perpendicular side\r\nagainst the wall, its base uppermost, and its hypotenuse out in\r\nthe air. Through the open centre of the triangle he introduced the\r\nend of his trapeze bar, chain and all, as far as it would go, then\r\ngave a mighty heave. The end of his lever was against the wall,\r\nand the power was applied in such a manner that few machine screws\r\ncould stand so great a strain. One by one, the screws were torn\r\nout of the wood, and finally each bracket worked upon was torn\r\noff.\r\n\r\nBut there was one exception. The screws of one bracket were so\r\nfirmly set in a particularly hard strip of the upright tongued-\r\nand-grooved yellow pine flooring that formed the wall, the board\r\nitself was finally torn out, full length! The board was four\r\ninches wide, seven-eighths of an inch thick, and seven feet long.\r\nOriginally it was so firmly nailed that no one believed that it\r\ncould be torn from its place. [Footnote: In the Winter of 1921\r\nabout a dozen newspapers in the United States published a\r\nsensational syndicated article, occupying an entire page, in which\r\nall of Dohong's lever discovery and cage-wrecking performances\r\nwere reported as of recent occurrence, and credited to a stupid\r\nand uninteresting young orang called Gabong, now in the Zoological\r\nPark, that has not even the merit of sufficient intelligence to\r\nmaintain a proper state of bodily uprightness, let alone the\r\ninvention of mechanical principles.]\r\n\r\nWithout delay, Dohong started in with his lever to pry off the\r\nremaining boards of the wall, but this movement was promptly\r\nchecked. Our next task consisted in making long bolts by which the\r\nbrackets of the horizontal bars were bolted entirely through the\r\npartition walls and held so powerfully on the other side that even\r\nthe lever could not wreck them.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the brackets were made secure, Dohong turned his\r\nattention to the two large sleeping boxes which were built very\r\nsolidly on the balcony of his cage. Both of those structures he\r\ntore completely to pieces,--always working with the utmost good\r\nnature and cheerfulness. Realizing that they could not exist in\r\nthe cage with him, we gave him a permit to tear them out--and save\r\nthe time of the carpenters.\r\n\r\nDohong's use of his lever was seen by hundreds of visitors, and\r\none frequent visitor to the Park, Mr. L. A. Camacho, an engineer,\r\nwas so much impressed that he published in the _Scientific\r\nAmerican_ an illustrated account of what he saw.\r\n\r\nFor a long period, Dohong had been more or less annoyed by the\r\nfact that he could not get his head out between the front bars of\r\nhis cage, and look around the partition into the home of his next-\r\ndoor neighbor. Very soon after he discovered the use of the lever,\r\nhe swung his trapeze bar out to the upper corner of his cage,\r\nthrust the end of it out between the first bar and the steel\r\ncolumn of the partition, and very deftly bent two of the iron bars\r\noutward far enough so that he could easily thrust his head outside\r\nand have his coveted look.\r\n\r\nOne of our later and largest orangs made a specialty of twisting\r\nthe straw of his bedding into a rope six or seven feet long, then\r\nthrowing it over his trapeze bar and swinging by it, forward and\r\nback.\r\n\r\nTime and space will not permit the enumeration of the various\r\nthings done by that ape of mechanical mind with his swinging rope\r\nand his trapeze, with ropes of straw _twisted by himself,_\r\nwith keys, locks, hammer, nails and boxes. Any man who can witness\r\nsuch manifestations as those described above, and deny the\r\nexistence in the animal of an ability to reason from cause to\r\neffect, must be prepared to deny the evidence of his own senses.\r\n\r\nThe individual variations between orangs, as also between\r\nchimpanzees, are great and striking. It may with truth be said\r\nthat no two individuals of either species are really quite alike\r\nin physiognomy, temperament and mental capacity. As subjects for\r\nthe experimental psychologist, it is difficult to see how any\r\nother could be found that would be even a good second in living\r\ninterest to the great apes. The facts thus far recorded, so I\r\nbelieve, present only a suggestion of the rich results that await\r\nthe patient scientific investigator. In the year 1915 Dr. Robert\r\nM. Yerkes, of Harvard University, conducted at Montecito,\r\nsouthern California, in a comfortable primate laboratory, six\r\nmonths of continuous and diligent experiments on the behavior of\r\norang-utans and monkeys. His report, published under the title of\r\n\"The Mental Life of Monkeys and Apes: A Study of Ideational\r\nBehavior,\" is a document of much interest and value. Dr. Yerkes'\r\nuse of the orang-utan as a subject was a decided step forward in\r\nthe study of \"animal behavior\" in America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTHE MAN-LIKENESS OF THE CHIMPANZEE\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the past twenty years, millions of thinking people have\r\nbeen startled, and not a few shocked, by the amazing and uncanny\r\nhuman-likeness of the performances of trained chimpanzees on the\r\ntheatrical stage. Really, when a well trained \"chimp\" is dressed\r\nfrom head to foot like a man, and is seen going with quickness,\r\nprecision and spirit through a performance half an hour in length,\r\nwe go away from it with an uncomfortable feeling that speech is\r\nall that he lacks of being a citizen.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 the American public saw Esau. Next came Consul,--in about\r\nthree or four separate editions! In 1909 we had Peter. Then came I\r\nknow not how many more, including the giant Casey and Mr. Garner's\r\nSusie; and finally in 1918 our own Suzette. The theatre-going\r\npublic has been well supplied with trained chimpanzees, and the\r\nmental capacity of that species is now more widely known and\r\nappreciated than that of any other wild animal except the Indian\r\nelephant.\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons why chimpanzees predominate on the\r\nstage, and why so few performing orang-utans have been seen. They\r\nare as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The orang is sanguine, and slower in execution than the nervous\r\nchimpanzee.\r\n\r\n2. The feet of the orang are not good for shoes, and biped work.\r\n\r\n3. The orang is rather awkward with its hands, and finally,\r\n\r\n4. There are fully twice as many chimps in the market.\r\n\r\nBut the chimpanzee has certain drawbacks of his own. His nervous\r\ntemper and his forced-draught activities soon wear him out. If he\r\nsurvives to see his sixth or seventh year, it is then that he\r\nbecomes so strong and so full of ego that he becomes dangerous and\r\nrequires to be retired.\r\n\r\nBright minds are more common among the chimpanzee species than\r\namong the orangs. Three chimps out of every five are good for\r\ntraining, but not more than two orangs out of five can be\r\nsatisfactorily developed.\r\n\r\nSome sensitive minds shrink from the idea that man has \"descended\"\r\nfrom the apes. I never for a moment shared that feeling. I would\r\nrather descend from a clean, capable and bright-minded genus of\r\napes than from any unclean, ignorant and repulsive race of the\r\ngenus _Homo._ In comparing the chimpanzees of Fernan Vaz\r\nwith the Canoe Indians of the Strait of Magellan and other human\r\ntribes we could name, I think the former have decidedly the best\r\nof it. There are millions of members of the human race who are\r\nmore loathsome and repulsive than wild apes.\r\n\r\nThe face of the chimpanzee is highly mobile, and the mouth, lips,\r\neyes and voice express the various emotions of the individual\r\nwith a degree of clearness and precision second only to the facial\r\nexpression of man himself. In fact, the face of an intelligent\r\nchimpanzee or orang-utan is a fairly constant index of the state\r\nof mind of the individual. In their turn, those enormously\r\nexpansive lips and keen brown eyes express contentment, doubt,\r\nfear and terror; affection, disapproval, jealousy, anger, rage;\r\nhunger and satiety; lonesomeness and illness.\r\n\r\nThe lips of the chimpanzee afford that animal several perfectly\r\ndistinct expressions of the individual's mind and feelings. While\r\nit is not possible to offer a description of each which will\r\ncertainly be recognizable to the reader, the two extremes will at\r\nleast be appreciated. When coaxing for food, or attention, the\r\nlips are thrust far out beyond the teeth, and formed into a funnel\r\nwith the small end outermost. When the chimpanzee flies into a\r\nrage at some real or fancied offense, the snarling lips are drawn\r\nback, and far up and down, until the teeth and gums are fully\r\nexposed in a ghastly threat of attack. At the same time, the voice\r\ngives forth shrill shrieks of rage, correctly represented by the\r\nsyllable \"Ee-ee-ee!\", prolonged, and repeated with great force,\r\nthree or four times. On such occasions as the latter, the\r\noffending party must look out for himself, or he may be roughly\r\nhandled.\r\n\r\nThe voice of the chimpanzee is strong, clear, and in captivity it\r\nis very much in evidence. Two of its moderate tones are almost\r\nmusical. It is heard when the animal says, coaxingly, \"Who'-oe!\r\nWho'-oe!\" A dozen times a day, our large specimens indulge in\r\nspells of loud yelling, purely for their own amusement. Their\r\nstrident cry sounds like \"Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! _Wah'_-hoo!\r\n_Wah'_-hoo! Hoo'-hoo! _Wah_-h-h-h! _Wah_-h-h!\" The\r\nsecond combination, \"Wah-hoo,\" consists of two sounds, four notes\r\napart.\r\n\r\nIt is with their voices that chimpanzees first manifest their\r\npleasure at seeing cherished friends of the human species, or\r\ntheir anger. Their recognition, and their exuberant joy on such\r\noccasions, is quite as apparent to every observer as are the\r\nmanifestations of welcome of demonstrative human beings.\r\n\r\nLike all other groups of species, the apes of various genera now\r\nliving vary widely in their mentalities. The chimpanzee has the\r\nmost alert and human-like mind but with less speed the orang-utan\r\nis a good second. The average captive gorilla, if judged by\r\nexisting standards for ape mentality, is a poor third in the\r\nanthropoid scale, below the chimp and orang; but since the rise of\r\nMajor Penny's family-pet gorilla, named John, we must revise all\r\nour former views of that species, and concede exceptions.\r\n\r\nIn studying the mental status of the primates I attach great\r\nimportance to the work and results of the professional trainers\r\nwho educate animals for stage performances. If the trainer does\r\nnot know which are the brightest species of apes, baboons and\r\nmonkeys, then who does? Their own fortunes depend upon their\r\nestimate of comparative mentality in the primates.  Fortunately for\r\nour purposes, the minds of the most intelligent and capable apes,\r\nbaboons, and monkeys have been partially developed and exploited\r\nby stage trainers, and to a far less extent by keepers in zoological\r\nparks. Some wonderful results have been achieved, and the best of\r\nthese have been seen by the public in theatres, in traveling shows\r\nand in zoological parks. All these performances have greatly\r\ninterested me, because they go so far as measures of mental\r\ncapacity. I wish to make it clear that I take them very seriously.\r\n\r\n[Illustration\r\nwith caption: PORTRAIT OF A HIGH-CASTE CHIMPANZEE \"Baldy\" was an\r\nanimal of fine intelligence and originality in thought. He was a\r\nnatural comedian]\r\n\r\nWhile many of the acts of trained animals are due to their power\r\nof mimicry and are produced by imitation rather than by original\r\nthought, even their imitative work reveals a breadth of\r\nintelligence, a range of memory and of activity and precision in\r\nthought and in energy which no logical mind can ignore. To say\r\nthat a chimpanzee who can swing through thirty or forty different\r\nacts \"does not think\" and \"does not reason,\" is to deny the\r\nevidence of the human senses, and fall outside the bounds of human\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nTraining Apes for Performances. As will appear in its own chapter,\r\nthere is nothing at all mysterious in the training of apes. The\r\nsubject must be young, and pliant in mind, and of cheerful and\r\nkind disposition. The poor subjects are left for cage life. The\r\ntrainer must possess intelligence of good quality, infinite\r\npatience and tireless industry. Furthermore, the stage properties\r\nmust be ample. An outfit of this kind can train any ape that is\r\nmentally and physically a good subject. Of course in every animal\r\nspecies, wild or domestic, there are individuals so dull and\r\nstupid that it is inexpedient to try to educate them.\r\n\r\nThe chimpanzee Suzette who came to us direct from the vaudeville\r\nstage performed every summer in her open-air \"arena cage,\" until\r\nshe entered motherhood, which put an end to her stage work. She\r\nwas a brilliant \"trick\" bicycle rider. She could stand upright on\r\na huge wooden ball, and by expert balancing and foot-work roll it\r\nup a steep incline, down a flight of stairs, and land it safely\r\nupon the stage, without once losing her balance or her control.\r\nShe was entirely at home on roller skates, and when taken out upon\r\nthe pavement of Baird Court she would go wildly careering around\r\nthe large grass plat at high speed.\r\n\r\nAll the above acts were acrobatic feats that called for original\r\nthought and action, and were such as no dull mind and body could\r\nexert. All the training skill in the world could not take a\r\nmachine and teach it to ride a bicycle through a collection of\r\nbottles, and an intelligent ape is a million years from being a\r\n\"machine in fur and feathers.\"\r\n\r\nMore than once I have been astounded by the performances of apes\r\non the stage. Mr. J. S. Edwards' orang-utan Joe was a very capable\r\nanimal, and his performances were wonderful. He could use a\r\nhammer in driving nails, and a screwdriver in inserting and\r\nextracting screws, with wonderful dexterity.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable chimpanzee performance that I ever saw was\r\ngiven in a New York theatre in 1909. The star actor was a fine\r\nmale animal about six years old, called Peter. I made a complete\r\nrecord of his various acts, and the program was as follows\r\n\r\nPERFORMANCE OF PETER, A CHIMPANZEE\r\n\r\nStage properties: a suit of clothes, shoes, chair, table, bed,\r\nbureau, hatrack, candle, cigarette, match, cuspidor, roller\r\nskates, bottles, flag, inclined plane and steps; plate, napkin,\r\ncup, spoon, teapot.\r\n\r\nAs Peter entered, he bowed to the audience, took off his cap and\r\nhung it upon a hatrack. He went to the table, seated himself in\r\nthe chair, unfolded and put on a napkin, and with a string\r\nfastened it in place under his chin. With a fork he speared some\r\nslices of banana and ate them. Into his tumbler he poured liquid\r\nfrom a bottle, drank, then corked the bottle. Next, he poured\r\ntea into a cup, put in sugar and cream, took tea from the spoon,\r\nthen drank from the cup. After that he took a toothpick and used\r\nit elaborately.\r\n\r\nStriking a match he lit a cigarette, and smoked. In perfect man-\r\nfashion he took the cigarette between his fingers, gave his keeper\r\na light, smoked again, and blew puffs of smoke first from one\r\ncorner of his mouth and then the other. Then he elaborately spat\r\ninto the cuspidor.\r\n\r\nNext in order he went to the bureau, cleaned his teeth with a\r\ntooth-brush, brushed his hair on both sides, looked into the\r\nmirror and powdered his face.\r\n\r\nFinally he bit a coin and put it on the keeper's plate as a tip.\r\n\r\nHe pulled off his coat, took off his cuffs and vest, and thus half\r\nundressed he joyously danced about, beating a tambourine. Then he\r\nremoved his shirt, trousers, shoes, garters and socks. Lighting\r\nhis candle he walked to his bed, blew out the candle and went to\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nVery soon he rose, put on his trousers and a pair of roller skates\r\nand playfully pursued a young woman who ran before him. His use of\r\nthe roller skates was excellent.\r\n\r\nThe stage was cleared of furniture, and a bicycle was brought out.\r\nHe mounted it and started off, at the first trial, and swiftly\r\nrode around the stage about fifteen times. While riding he took\r\noff his cap and waved it. He rode up an inclined plane and down\r\nfour steps without falling off, repeating for an encore,--but\r\nhere he became peeved about something.\r\n\r\nFive bottles were set in a figure 8, and he rode between them\r\nseveral times. At last he took up a bottle and drank out of it.\r\nThen he drank out of a tumbler, all while riding. After much flag-\r\nwaving and swift riding, Peter stopped at the center of the stage,\r\ndismounted, bowed, clapped his hands vigorously and retired.\r\n\r\nPeter's performance was remarkable because of the great length of\r\nit, the absolute skill and precision of it, and the animal's easy\r\nmastery of every situation. There was a notable absence of\r\nhesitations and mistakes, and of visible direction. The trainer\r\nseemed to do nothing save to assist with the stage properties,\r\njust as an assistant helps any acrobat through the property\r\nbusiness of his act. If any commands or signs were given, the\r\naudience was not aware of it. Later on I learned that sometimes\r\nPeter did not perform with such spirit, and required some urging\r\nto be prompt. The trainer was kept hustling to keep up with his\r\nown duties. The animal seemed to remember, and I believe he did\r\nremember, the sequence of a performance of _fifty-six separate\r\nacts!_\r\n\r\nWhen I witnessed Peter's performance in New York, saw the length\r\nof it and noted the immense amount of nervous energy that each\r\nperformance used up, I made the prediction that he could not for\r\none year endure such a strain. It was reported to me that he died\r\nnine months from that time.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1909, when Peter went to Philadelphia, he was\r\nfrequently and closely studied and observed by Dr. Lightner\r\nWitmer, professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania,\r\nand his mentality was tested at the laboratory of the University.\r\nDr. Witmer's conclusions, as set forth in a paper in the December\r\n(1909) issue of the _Psychological Clinic,_ are of very great\r\ninterest. He approached Peter's first performance in a skeptical\r\nframe of mind. I gladly waive the opportunity to express my own\r\nviews regarding Peter in order to put upon the stand a more\r\ncompetent witness. Hear Dr. Witmer:\r\n\r\n\"As I entered the theatre,\" he says, \"my feelings were commingled\r\ninterest and doubt. My doubts were bred from knowledge of the\r\ndifficulty of judging the intelligence of an animal from a stage\r\nperformance. So-called educated horses and even educated seals and\r\nfleas have made their appeal in large number to the credulity of\r\nthe public. Can any animal below man be educated in the proper\r\nsense of the word? Or is the animal mind susceptible of nothing\r\nmore than a mechanical training, and only given the specious\r\ncounterfeit of an educated intelligence when under the direct\r\ncontrol of the trainer?\r\n\r\n\"Since that day I have seen Peter in five public performances,\r\nhave tested him at my psychological clinic and privately on three\r\noccasions. I now believe that in a very real sense the animal is\r\nhimself giving the stage performance. He knows what he is doing,\r\nhe delights in it, he varies it from time to time, he understands\r\nthe succession of tricks which are being called for, he is guided\r\nby word of mouth without any signal open or concealed, and the\r\nfunction of his trainer is exercised mainly to steady and control.\r\n\r\n\"I am prepared to accept the statement of his trainers, Mr. and\r\nMrs. McArdle, that Peter's proficiency is not so much the result\r\nof training as of downright self-education.\"\r\n\r\nPeter was put through many of the tests which Dr. Witmer uses for\r\nthe study of backward children. He performed many of these tests\r\nin a very satisfactory manner. He was able to string beads the\r\nfirst time he tried it. He put pegs in the ordinary kindergarten\r\npegging board. He opened and closed a very difficult lock. He used\r\nhammer and screw driver, and distinguished without any mistake\r\nbetween nails and screws. A peculiar kind of hammer was given to\r\nhim in order to fool him, but Peter was not fooled. He felt both\r\nends of the hammer and used the flat end instead of the round end.\r\n\r\nShowing his initiative during the tests, Peter got away from those\r\nwho were watching him and darted for a washstand, quickly turned\r\nthe faucet and put his mouth to the spigot and secured a drink\r\nbefore he was snatched away by his trainers. He understood\r\nlanguage and followed instructions without signs. He was able to\r\nsay \"mamma,\" and Doctor Witmer taught him in five minutes to give\r\nthe sound of \"p.\" The most remarkable performance was making the\r\nletter \"w\" on the blackboard, in which he imitated Doctor Witmer's\r\nmovements exactly, and reproduced a fair copy of the letter.\r\n\r\nThe last four paragraphs reproduced above have been copied from an\r\narticle which appeared in the Philadelphia _Public Ledger_ on\r\nDecember 17, 1909.\r\n\r\nDr. Witmer declares that the study of this ape's mind is a subject\r\nfit, not for the animal psychologist, but for the child\r\npsychologist.\r\n\r\nSuzette's Failure in Maternal Instinct. As a closing contribution\r\nto our observations on the chimpanzee, I must record a tragic\r\nfailure in maternal instinct, as well as in general intelligence,\r\nin a chimpanzee.\r\n\r\nIn 1919 our two fine eight-year old chimpanzees, Boma and Suzette,\r\nwere happily married. It was a genuine love match, and strictly\r\nmonogamous at that; for while big Fanny Chimp in the cage next\r\ndoor to Boma loved Boma and openly courted him, he was\r\noutrageously indifferent to her, and even scorned her. After\r\nseven months of gestation, a very good baby was born to Suzette,\r\nquite naturally and successfully. Boma's shouts of excitement and\r\ndelight carried half a mile throughout the Park. Everything looked\r\nmost auspicious for the rearing of a wonderful cage-bred and\r\ncage-born chimpanzee, the second one ever born in captivity.\r\nInstead of carrying her infant astride her hip, as do orang\r\nmothers, and the coolie women of India, Suzette astonished us\r\nbeyond measure by tucking it _into her groin,_ between her\r\nthigh and her abdomen, head outward. It was a fine place,--warm\r\nand soft,--but not good when overdone! When Suzette walked, as she\r\nfreely did, she held up the leg responsible for the baby, to hold\r\nit securely in place, and walked upon the other foot and her two\r\nhands. About all this there was one very bad thing. The baby was\r\nperfectly helpless! As long as the mother chose to keep it in her\r\ngroin prison, it could not get free.\r\n\r\nSuzette was completely isolated, kept absolutely quiet, and every\r\nchance was given her to go on with the functions of motherhood.\r\nHer breasts contained plenty of milk, and the flow was due to\r\nstart on the second day after the infant's arrival.\r\n\r\nDay and night the baby was jealously confined in that massive and\r\npowerful groin,--and _under too much pressure!_ When the baby\r\ncried, and kicked, and struggled to get free, Suzette would\r\nnervously rearrange her straw bed, carefully pick from the tiny\r\nfingers every straw that they had clutched, and settle down again.\r\nIf the struggle was soon renewed, Suzette would change the infant\r\nover to the other groin, and close upon it as before.\r\n\r\nSleeping or waking, walking, sitting or lying down, she held it\r\nthere. If we attempted to touch the infant, the mother instantly\r\nbecame savage and dangerous. Not one human finger was permitted to\r\ntouch it. For hours, and for days, we anxiously watched for\r\nnursing to begin; but in vain. At last we became almost frantic\r\nfrom the spectacle of the infant being slowly starved to death\r\nbecause the mother did not realize that it needed her milk, and\r\nthat she alone could promote nursing. _Her mother instinct\r\nutterly failed to supply the link that alone could connect infancy\r\nto motherhood, and furnish life._\r\n\r\nOf course this failure was due to poor Suzette's artificial life,\r\nand unnatural surroundings. Had she been all alone, in the depths\r\nof a tropical forest, Nature would have proceeded along her usual\r\nlines. But in our Primate House, Suzette felt that her infant was\r\nsurrounded by a host of strange enemies, from whom it must be\r\nstrongly and persistently _guarded and defended._ That was\r\nthe idea that completely dominated her mind, ruled out all human\r\nhelp, and blocked the main process of nature.\r\n\r\nDuring the eight days that the infant lived, it was able to reach\r\nher breast and nurse only once, for about one minute; and then\r\nback it went to its prison, where it died from sheer lack of\r\nnourishment.\r\n\r\nIn 1920, that same history was repeated, except that on this\r\noccasion our Veterinary Surgeon, Dr. W. Reid Blair, worked (on the\r\nfifth day) for seven hours without intermission to stupefy Suzette\r\nwith chloroform, or other opiates, sufficiently to make it\r\npossible to remove the baby without a fight with the mother and\r\nits certain death. Owing to her savage temper all the work had to\r\nbe done between iron bars, to keep from losing hands or arms, and\r\nthe handicap on the human hand was too great. Even when Suzette\r\nhad received chloroform for an hour and twenty minutes, and was\r\nregarded as _half dead,_ at the first touch of a human finger\r\nupon her thigh she instantly aroused and sprang up, raging and\r\nready for battle.\r\n\r\nThe whole effort failed. To rope Suzette and attempt to control\r\nher by force would have been sheer folly, or worse. In such a\r\nstruggle the infant would have been torn to pieces.\r\n\r\nThe second one died as the first one did, and for an awful week we\r\nwere unable to gain possession of the decomposing cadaver. Suzette\r\nknew that something was wrong, and she realized the awful odor,\r\nbut that idea of defense of her offspring obscured all others. In\r\nmaintaining her possession of that infant, nothing could surpass\r\nthe cunning of that ape mother. Will we ever succeed in outwitting\r\nher, and in getting one of her babies alive into a baby incubator?\r\nWho can say?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nTHE TRUE MENTAL STATUS OF THE GORILLA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe true mental status of the gorilla was discovered in 1919 and\r\n1920, at 15 Sloane Street, London, by Major Rupert Penny, of the\r\nRoyal Air Service, and his young relative, Miss Alyse Cunningham.\r\nPrior to that time, through various combinations of retarding\r\ncircumstances, no living gorilla had ever been placed and kept in\r\nan environment calculated to develop and display the real mental\r\ncalibre of the gorilla mind. It seems that an exhibition cage, in\r\na zoological park or garden thronged with visitors, actually tends\r\nto the suppression, or even the complete extinguishment, of true\r\ngorilla character. The atmosphere of the footlights and the stage\r\nin which the chimpanzee delights and thrives is to the gorilla\r\nrepulsive and unbearable.\r\n\r\nJudging by Major Penny's \"John,\" the gorilla wishes to live in a\r\nhigh-class human family, in a modern house, and be treated like a\r\nhuman being! It is now definitely recognized by us, and also by\r\nour colleagues in the London Zoological Gardens, that gorillas can\r\nnot live long and thrive on public exhibition, before great crowds\r\nof people, and that it is folly to insist upon trying to compel\r\nthem to do so. The male individual that lived several years in the\r\nBreslau Zoological Garden and attained the age of seven years was\r\na striking exception.\r\n\r\nWe have had two gorillas at our Park, one of which, a female named\r\nDinah, arrived in good health, and lived with us eleven and one-\r\nhalf months. Her mind was dull and hopelessly unresponsive. She\r\nlearned next to nothing, and she did nothing really interesting.\r\nOther captive gorillas I have known have been equally morose and\r\nunresponsive, and lived fewer months than Dinah.\r\n\r\nIt is because of such animals as Dinah that for fifty years the\r\nmental status of the gorilla species has been under a cloud. Until\r\nnow it has been much misunderstood and unappreciated. Of the few\r\ngorillas that have been seen in England and America, I think that\r\nall save John have been so morose and unresponsive, _and so\r\nundeveloped by companionship and training_, that mentally they\r\nhave been rated far below the chimpanzee and orang.\r\n\r\nOur own Dinah was no exception to the rule. Personally she was a\r\nstupid little thing, even when in excellent health. Her most\r\npronounced and exasperating stupidities were shown in her refusal\r\nto eat, or to taste, strange food, even when very hungry. Any ape\r\nthat does not know enough to eat a fine, ripe banana, and will\r\nonly mince away at the _inner lining_ of the banana skin, is\r\nan unmitigated numskull, and hardly fit to live. Dinah was all\r\nthat, and more. But, alas! We have seen a few stupid human\r\nchildren who obstinately refused even to taste certain new and\r\nunknown kinds of food, because they \"know\" they will not like\r\nthem! So Dinah was not alone in her childish folly.\r\n\r\nAt last a chain of circumstances placed an intellectual and\r\nsensible gorilla, two years of age, in the hands of a family\r\nspecially fitted by education and home surroundings to develop its\r\nmind and its manners. The results of those efforts have given to\r\nthe gorilla an entirely new mental status. Thanks to the\r\nenterprise and diligence of Major Rupert Penny and Miss Cunningham\r\nin purchasing and caring for a sick and miserable young male\r\ngorilla,--a most hazardous risk,--a new chapter in wild-animal\r\npsychology now is to be written.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1918, \"John Gorilla\" was purchased in a London\r\ndepartment store, out of a daily atmosphere heated to _85\r\ndegrees_, and a nightly condition of solitude and terror. From\r\nthat awful state it was taken to live in Major Penny's comfortable\r\napartments. John was seriously ill. He was in a \"rickety\"\r\ncondition, and he weighed only 32 pounds. With a pure atmosphere,\r\nkept at 65 degrees only, and amid good surroundings, he soon\r\nbecame well. He attained such robust health and buoyant spirits\r\nthat in March, 1921, he stood 40 1/2 inches high and weighed 112\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nAt my solicitation Miss Cunningham wrote out for me the very\r\nremarkable personal history of that wonderful animal,--apparently\r\nthe most wonderful gorilla ever observed in captivity. It is a\r\nclear, straightforward and convincing record, and not one of its\r\nstatements is to be for one moment doubted. While it is too long\r\nto reproduce here in its entirety, I will present a condensation\r\nof it, in Miss Cunningham's own words that will record the salient\r\nfacts,--with no changes save in arrangement.\r\n\r\nMiss Cunningham says:\r\n\r\nLONELINESS. \"We soon found it was impossible to leave him alone at\r\nnight, because he shrieked every night, and nearly all night, from\r\nloneliness and fear. This we found he had done in the store where\r\nhe lived before coming to us. He always began to cry directly he\r\nsaw the assistants putting things away for the night. We found\r\nthat this loneliness at night was trying on his health and\r\nappetite. As soon as possible my nephew had his bed made up every\r\nnight in the room adjoining the cage, with the result that John\r\nwas quite happy, and began to grow and put on fat.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. \"I fed him, washed his hands, face and feet twice a\r\nday, and brushed and combed his hair,--which he would try to do\r\nhimself whenever he got hold of the brush or comb. He soon got to\r\nlike all this.\r\n\r\nTRAINING. \"My next idea was to teach him to be strictly clean in\r\nhis habits. It was my ambition to be able to have him upstairs in\r\nour house as an ordinary member of the household. I taught him\r\nfirst as a child is taught and handled. This took some time. At\r\nfirst I could not make him understand what we expected of him,\r\neven though I always petted him and gave him grapes (of which he\r\nwas especially fond), but I think at first he imagined that this\r\ntreatment was a punishment. At first, without other reasons, he\r\nwould roll on the floor and shriek, but directly he understood\r\nwhat was expected of him he soon learned, and began to behave\r\nexcellently.\r\n\r\n\"This training occupied quite six weeks. About February, 1919, we\r\ntook him out of his cage, and allowed him the freedom of the\r\nhouse. Thereafter he would run upstairs to the bathroom of his own\r\naccord, turning the doorknob of whatever room he was in, and also\r\nopening the door of the bathroom.... He would get out of bed in\r\nthe night by himself, go back to bed, and pull the blankets over\r\nhimself quite neatly.\r\n\r\nFOOD. \"John's appetite seemed to tire of foods very quickly. The\r\nonly thing he stuck to was milk, which he liked best when warmed.\r\nWe began by giving him a quart a day, rising to three and one-half\r\nquarts a day. I found that he preferred to choose his own food, so\r\nI used to prepare for him several kinds, such as bananas, oranges,\r\napples, grapes, raisins, currants, dates and any small fruits in\r\nseason, such as raspberries or strawberries, _all of which he\r\nliked to have warmed!_\r\n\r\n\"These displays I placed on a high shelf in the kitchen, where he\r\ncould get them with difficulty. I think that he thought himself\r\nvery clever when he stole anything. He never would eat anything\r\nstale. He was extremely fond of fresh lemon jelly, but he never\r\nwould touch it after the second day. He loved roses, _to\r\neat_, more than anything. The more beautiful they were, the\r\nmore he liked them, but he never would eat faded roses. He never\r\ncared much for nuts of any other kind than baked peanuts, save\r\nwalnuts. I found that nuts gave him dreadful spells of\r\nindigestion.\r\n\r\nUSE OF TOOLS. \"He knew what hammers and chisels were for, but for\r\nobvious reasons we never encouraged him in anything to do with\r\ncarpentry. With cocoanuts he was very funny. He knew that they had\r\nto be broken, and he would try to break them on the floor. When he\r\nfound he couldn't manage that, he would bring the nut to one of us\r\nand try to make us understand what he wished. If we gave him a\r\nhammer he would try to use it on the nut, and on not being able to\r\nmanage that, he would give back to us both the hammer and the\r\ncocoanut.\r\n\r\nGAMES AND PLAY. \"We never taught him any tricks; he simply\r\nacquired knowledge himself. A game he was very fond of was to\r\npretend he was blind, shutting his eyes very tightly, and running\r\naround the room knocking against tables and chairs. . . . We found\r\nthat exercise was the thing he required to keep him in health, and\r\nmy nephew used to give him plenty of that by playing hide and seek\r\nwith him in the morning before breakfast, and in the evening\r\nbefore dinner,--up and down stairs, in and out of all the rooms.\r\nHe simply loved that game, and would giggle and laugh while being\r\nchased.... If he saw that a stranger was at all nervous about him,\r\nhe loved running past him, and giving him a smack on the leg,--and\r\nyou could see him grin as he did so.\r\n\r\n\"A thing he greatly enjoyed was to stand on the top rail of his\r\nbed and jump on the springs, head over heels, just like a child.\r\n\r\nCAUTION. \"He was very cautious. He would never run into a dark\r\nroom without first turning on the light.\r\n\r\nFEAR. \"John seemed to realize danger for other people in high\r\nplaces, for if anyone looked out of a high window he always pushed\r\nthem away if he were at the window himself, but if he was away\r\nfrom it he would run and pull them back. . . . He was very much\r\nafraid of full-grown sheep, cows and horses, but he loved colts,\r\ncalves and lambs, proving to us that he recognized youth.\r\n\r\nWOODS VS. FIELDS. \"We found he did not like fields or open\r\ncountry, but he was very happy in a garden, or in woods. . . . He\r\nalways liked nibbling twigs, and to eat the green buds of trees.\r\n\r\nTABLE MANNERS. \"His table manners were really very good. He always\r\nsat at the table, and whenever a meal was ready, would pull his\r\nown chair up to his place. He did not care to eat a great deal,\r\nbut he especially liked to drink water out of a tumbler. . . . He\r\nwas the least greedy of all the animals I have ever seen. He never\r\nwould snatch anything, and always ate very slowly. He always drank\r\na lot of water, which he would always get himself whenever he\r\nwanted it by turning on a tap. Strange to say, he always turned\r\noff the water when he had finished drinking.\r\n\r\nPLAYING TO THE GALLERY. \"John seemed to think that everyone was\r\ndelighted to see him, and he would throw up the window whenever he\r\nwas permitted. If he found the sash locked he would unfasten it,\r\nand when a big crowd had collected outside he would clap his chest\r\nand his hands. [Footnote: In the summer of 1920 a globe-trotter\r\njust arrived from England excitedly reported to me: \"While driving\r\nalong a street in London _I saw a live gorilla_ in the upper\r\nwindow of an apartment. It was a _real gorilla;_ and it\r\nclapped its hands at us as we looked! Now _what_ did it all\r\nmean?\" Fortunately I was able to explain it.]\r\n\r\nPUNISHMENT AND REPENTANCE. \"We made one very great mistake with\r\nJohn. His cage was used as a punishment, with the result that we\r\nnever could leave him there alone, for he would shriek all the\r\ntime. . . . Now, a stick was the one thing that our gorilla would\r\nnot stand from anyone, save Major Penny and myself. Presently we\r\nfound out that the only way to deal with him was to tell him that\r\nhe was very naughty, and push him away from us; when he would roll\r\non the floor and cry, and be very-repentant, holding one's ankles,\r\nand putting his head on our feet.\r\n\r\nAFFECTION FOR A CHILD. \"He was especially fond of my little niece,\r\nthree years old. John and she used to play together for hours, and\r\nhe seemed to understand what she wanted him to do. If she ever\r\ncried, and her mother would not go and pick her up, John would\r\nalways try and nip the mother, or give her a smack with the full\r\nweight of his hand, evidently thinking she was the cause of the\r\nchild's tears.\r\n\r\nA SENSE OF GOOD ORDER. \"He loved to take everything\r\nout of a wastepaper basket and strew the contents all over the\r\nroom, after which, when told to do so he would pick up everything\r\nand put it all back, but looking very bored all the while. If the basket\r\nwas very full he would push it all down very carefully, to make room\r\nfor more. He would always put things back when told to do so, such\r\nas books from a bookshelf or things from a table.\r\n\r\n[Illustration caption: THE GORILLA WITH THE WONDERFUL MIND Owned\r\nby Major Rupert Penny, educated by Miss Alyse Cunningham, London,\r\n1918-1921]\r\n\r\nTWO CASES OF ORIGINAL THOUGHT. (1) \"One day we were going out, for\r\nwhich I was sitting ready dressed, when John wished to sit in my\r\nlap. My sister, Mrs. Penny, said: 'Don't let him. He will spoil\r\nyour dress.'\r\n\r\n\"As my dress happened to be a light one I pushed him away, and\r\nsaid, 'No!' He at once lay on the floor and cried just like a\r\nchild, for about a minute. Then he rose, looked round the room,\r\nfound a newspaper, went and picked it up, spread it on my lap and\r\nclimbed up. This was quite the cleverest thing I ever saw him do.\r\n_Even those who saw it said they would not have believed it had\r\nthey not seen it themselves!_ Both my nephews, (Major Penny and\r\nMr. E. C. Penny), his wife and my sister (Mrs. Penny) were in the\r\nroom, and can testify to the correctness of the above record.\r\n\r\n(2) \"Another clever thing John did, although I suspect this was\r\ndue more to instinct that to downright cleverness. A piece of\r\nfilet beefsteak had just come from the butcher. Inasmuch as\r\noccasionally I gave him a small mouthful of raw beef, a small\r\npiece of the coarser part of the steak was cut off, and I gave it\r\nto him. He tasted it, then gravely handed it back to me. Then he\r\ntook my hand and put it on the finer part of the meat. From that I\r\ncut off a tiny piece, gave it to him, and he ate it. When my\r\nnephew came home he wouldn't believe it, so I tried it again, with\r\nthe same result, except that then he did not even attempt to eat\r\nthe coarser meat.\"\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nConcerning Miss Cunningham's wonderful story, I wish to state that\r\nI believe all of it,--because there is no reason to do otherwise!\r\nIt sets a new mark in gorilla lore, and it lifts a curtain from an\r\nanimal mind that previously was unknown, and very generally\r\nmisunderstood.\r\n\r\nTo the Doubting Thomases who will doubt some portions of Miss\r\nCunningham's story, let me cite, by way of caution, the following\r\nhistory:\r\n\r\nWhen Du Chaillu discovered the gorilla, and came to America and\r\nEngland with his specimens to tell about it, he said that when a\r\nbig gorilla is attacked and made angry it beats its breast,\r\nrepeatedly, with its clenched fists. The wiseacres of that day\r\nsolemnly shook their heads and said: \"Oh, no! That can not be\r\ntrue. No ape ever did that. He is romancing!\" But now we know that\r\nthis breast-beating and chest-clapping habit is to a gorilla a\r\ncommon-place performance, even in captivity.\r\n\r\nSometimes there are more things in heaven and earth than are\r\ndreamt of in all our philosophy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nTHE MIND OF THE ELEPHANT\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in the jungles of the Animallai Hills of southern India\r\nthat I first became impressed by the mental capacity of the Indian\r\nelephant. I saw many wild herds. I saw elephants at work, and at\r\none period I lived in a timber camp, consisting of working\r\nelephants and mahouts. I saw a shrewd young elephant-driver\r\nsoundly flogged for stealing an elephant, farming it out to a\r\nnative timber contractor for four days, and then elaborately\r\npretending that the animal had been \"lost.\" Later on I saw\r\nelephant performances in the \"Greatest Show on Earth\" and\r\nelsewhere, and for eighteen years I have been chief mourner over\r\nthe idiosyncrasies of Gunda and Alice. If I do not now know\r\nsomething about elephants, then my own case of animal intelligence\r\nis indeed hopeless.\r\n\r\nTo me it seems that the only thing necessary to establish the\r\nelephant as an animal of remarkable intellect and power of\r\noriginal reasoning is to set forth the unadorned facts that lie\r\nready to hand.\r\n\r\nCuvier recorded the opinion that in sagacity the elephant in no\r\nway excels the dog and some other species of carnivora. Sir\r\nEmerson Tennent, even after some study of the elephant, was\r\ndisposed to award the palm for intelligence to the dog, but only\r\n\"from the higher degree of development consequent on his more\r\nintimate domestication and association with man.\" In the mind of\r\nG. P. Sanderson we fear that familiarity with the elephant bred a\r\nmeasure of contempt; and this seems very strange. He says:\r\n\r\n\"Its reasoning faculties are undoubtedly far below those of the\r\ndog, and possibly of other animals; and in matters beyond its\r\ndaily experience it evinces no special discernment.\"\r\n\r\nTo me it seems that all three of those opinions are off the\r\ntarget. The dog is not a wild, untrammeled animal; and neither\r\ndogs, cats nor savage men evince any special discernment \"beyond\r\nthe range of their daily experience.\" Moreover, there are some\r\nmillions of tame men of whom the same may be said with entire\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nVery often the question is asked: \"Is the African elephant equal\r\nin intelligence and training capacity to the Indian species?\"\r\n\r\nTo this we must answer: Not proven. We do not know. The African\r\nspecies never has been tried out on the same long and wide basis\r\nas the Indian. Many individual African elephants, very\r\nintelligent, have been trained, successfully, and have given good\r\naccounts of themselves. For my own part I am absolutely sure that\r\nwhen taken in hand at the same age, and trained on the same basis\r\nas the Indian species, the African elephant will be found mentally\r\nquite the equal of the Indian, and just as available for work or\r\nperformances.\r\n\r\nNo negro tribe really likes to handle elephants and train them.\r\nThe Indian native loves elephants, and enjoys training them and\r\nworking with them. It is these two conditions that have left the\r\nAfrican elephant far behind the procession. The African elephant\r\nbelongs to the great Undeveloped Continent. He has been, and he\r\nstill is, mercilessly pursued and slaughtered for his tusks. All\r\nthe existing species of African elephants are going down and out\r\nbefore the ivory hunters. We fear that they will all be dead one\r\nhundred years from this time, or even less. A century hence, when\r\nthe last _africanus_ has gone to join the mammoth and the\r\nmastodon, his well protected wild congener in India still will be\r\ndevouring his four hundred pounds of green fodder per day, and the\r\ntame ones will be performing to amuse the swarming human millions\r\nof this overcrowded world.\r\n\r\nIn the minds of our elephant keepers, familiarity with elephants\r\nhas bred just the reverse of contempt. Both Thuman and Richards\r\nare quite sure that elephants are the wisest of all wild animals.\r\n\r\nDespite the very great amount of trouble made for Keeper Thuman by\r\nGunda, the Indian, and Kartoum, the African, Thuman grows\r\nenthusiastic over the shrewdness of their \"cussedness.\" He is\r\nparticularly impressed by their skill in opening chain shackles,\r\nand unfastening the catches and locks of doors and gates. And\r\nreally, Kartoum's ingenuity in finding out how to open latches and\r\nbolts is almost inexhaustible, as well as marvelous.\r\n\r\nKeeper Richards declares that our late African pygmy elephant,\r\nCongo, was the wisest animal he ever has known. I have elsewhere\r\nreferred to his ability in shutting his outside door. Richards\r\ntaught him to accept coins from visitors, deposit them in a box,\r\nthen pull a cord to ring a bell, one pull for each coin\r\nrepresented. The keeper devised four different systems of intimate\r\nsignals by which he could tell Congo to stop at the right point,\r\nand all these were so slight that no one ever detected them. One\r\nwas by a voice-given cue, another by a hand motion, and a third\r\nwas by an inclination of the body.\r\n\r\nKeeper Richards relates that Congo would go out in his yard,\r\ncollect a trunkful of peanuts from visitors, bring them inside and\r\nsecretly cache them in a corner behind his feed box. Then he would\r\ngo out for more graft peanuts, bring them in, hide them and\r\nproceed to eat the first lot. There are millions of men who do not\r\nknow what it is to conserve something that can be eaten.\r\n\r\nIn this discussion of the intellectual powers and moral qualities\r\nof the elephant I will confine myself to my own observations on\r\n_Elephas indicus_, except where otherwise stated. A point to\r\nwhich we ask special attention is that in endeavoring to estimate\r\nthe mental capacity of the elephant, we will base no general\r\nconclusions upon _any particularly intelligent individual_,\r\nas all mankind is tempted to do in discussions of the intelligence\r\nof the dog, the cat, the horse, parrot and ape. On the contrary,\r\nit is our desire to reveal the mental capacity of _every\r\nelephant living_, tame or wild, except the few individuals with\r\nabnormal or diseased minds. It is not to be shown how successfully\r\n_an_ elephant has been taught by man, but how _all_\r\nelephants in captivity have been taught, and the mental capacity\r\nof _every_ elephant.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of intellectual qualities we have first to consider\r\nthe elephant's\r\n\r\nPOWERS OF INDEPENDENT OBSERVATIONS, AND REASONING FROM CAUSE TO\r\nEFFECT\r\n\r\nWhile many wonderful stories are related of the elephant's\r\nsagacity and independent powers of reasoning, it must be admitted\r\nthat a greater number of more wonderful anecdotes are told on\r\nequally good authority of dogs. But the circumstances in the case\r\nare wholly to the advantage of the universal dog, and against the\r\nrarely seen elephant. While the former roams at will through his\r\nmaster's premises, through town and country, mingling freely with\r\nall kinds of men and domestic animals, with unlimited time to lay\r\nplans and execute them, the elephant in captivity is chained to a\r\nstake, with no liberty of action whatever aside from begging with\r\nhis trunk, eating and drinking. His only amusement is in swaying\r\nhis body, swinging one foot, switching his tail, and (in a\r\nzoological park) looking for something that he can open or\r\ndestroy. Such a ponderous beast cannot be allowed to roam at large\r\namong human beings, and the working elephant never leaves his\r\nstake and chain except under the guidance of his mahout. There is\r\nno means of estimating the wonderful powers of reasoning that\r\ncaptive elephants might develop if they could only enjoy the\r\nfreedom accorded to all dogs except the blood-hound, bull-dog and\r\na few others.\r\n\r\nIn the jungles of India the writer frequently has seen wild\r\nelephants reconnoitre dangerous ground by means of a scout or spy;\r\ncommunicate intelligence by signs; retreat in orderly silence from\r\na lurking danger, and systematically march, in single file, like\r\nthe jungle tribes of men.\r\n\r\nOnce having approached to within fifty yards of the stragglers of\r\na herd of about thirty wild elephants, which was scattered over\r\nabout four acres of very open forest and quietly feeding, two\r\nindividuals of the herd on the side nearest us suddenly suspected\r\ndanger. One of them elevated his trunk, with the tip bent forward,\r\nand smelled the air from various points of the compass. A moment\r\nlater an old elephant left the herd and started straight for our\r\nambush, scenting the air with upraised trunk as he slowly and\r\nnoiselessly advanced. We instantly retreated, unobserved and\r\nunheard. The elephant advanced until he reached the identical spot\r\nwhere we had a moment before been concealed. He paused, and stood\r\nmotionless as a statue for about two minutes, then wheeled about\r\nand quickly but noiselessly rejoined the herd. In less than half\r\na minute the whole herd was in motion, heading directly away from\r\nus, and moving very rapidly, but _without the slightest\r\nnoise_. The huge animals simply vanished like shadows into the\r\nleafy depths of the forest. Before proceeding a quarter of a mile,\r\nthe entire herd formed in single file and continued strictly in\r\nthat order for several miles. Like the human dwellers in the\r\njungle, the elephants know that the easiest and most expeditious\r\nway for a large body of animals to traverse a tangled forest is\r\nfor the leader to pick the way, while all the others follow in his\r\nfootsteps.\r\n\r\nIn strong contrast with the stealthy and noiseless manner in which\r\nelephants steal away from a lurking danger, or an ambush\r\ndiscovered, from an open attack accompanied with the noise of\r\nfire-arms they rush away at headlong speed, quite regardless of\r\nthe noise they make. On one occasion a herd which I was designing\r\nto attack, and had approached to within forty yards, as its\r\nmembers were feeding in some thick bushes, discovered my presence\r\nand retreated so silently that they had been gone five minutes\r\nbefore I discovered what their sudden quietude really meant. In\r\nthis instance, as in several others, the still alarm was\r\ncommunicated by silent signals, or sign-language.\r\n\r\nAt the Zoological Park we reared an African pygmy elephant\r\n(_Elephas pumilio_). When his slender little tusks grew to\r\neighteen inches in length he made some interesting uses of them.\r\nOnce when the keepers wished to lead him upon our large platform\r\nscales, the trembling of the platform frightened him. He conceived\r\nthe idea that it was unsafe, and therefore that he must keep off.\r\nHe backed away, halted, and refused to leave solid ground. The men\r\npushed him. He backed, and trumpeted a shrill protest. The men\r\npushed harder, and forced him forward. Trumpeting his wild alarm\r\nand his protest against what he regarded as murder, he fell upon\r\nhis knees and drove his tusks into the earth, quite up to his\r\nmouth, to anchor himself firmly to the solid ground. It was\r\npathetic, but also amusing. When Congo finally was pushed upon the\r\nscales and weighed, he left the trembling instrument of torture\r\nwith an air of disgust and disapproval that was quite as eloquent\r\nas words. On several occasions when taken out for exercise in the\r\npark, he endeavored to hinder the return to quarters by anchoring\r\nhimself to Mother Earth.\r\n\r\nCongo once startled us by his knowledge of the usefulness of\r\ndoors. For a time he was kept in a compartment that had an outside\r\ndoor running sidewise on a trolley track, and controlled by two\r\nhanging chains, one to close it and one to open it. Each chain had\r\non its end a stout iron ring for a handle. One chilly morning when\r\nI went to see Congo, I asked his keeper to open his door, so that\r\nhe could go out.\r\n\r\nThe keeper did so, by pulling the right hand chain. The moment the\r\ndraft of chilly outer air struck Congo, who stood in the centre of\r\nhis stall facing me, he impatiently wheeled about, walked up to\r\nthe left hand chain, grabbed it with his trunk, slipped the ring\r\nover one of his tusks, then inclined his head downward and with an\r\nirritated tug pulled the door shut with a spiteful slam. \"Open\r\nit again,\" I said to the keeper.\r\n\r\nHe did so, and in the same way, but with a visible increase in\r\nirritation, Congo closed it in the same manner as before. Again\r\nthe keeper opened the door, and this time, with a real exhibition\r\nof temper Congo again thrust the ring over his tusk, and brought\r\nthe door shut with a resounding bang. It was his regular habit to\r\nclose that door, or to open it, when he felt like more air or less\r\nair; and who is there who will say that the act was due to\r\n\"instinct\" in a jungle-bred animal, or anything else than original\r\nthought. The ring on his tusk was his own invention, as a means to\r\na desired end.\r\n\r\nEvery elephant that we ever have had has become, through his own\r\ninitiative and experimenting, an expert in unfastening the latches\r\nof doors and gates, and in untying chains and ropes. Gunda always\r\nknew enough to attack the padlocks on his leg chains, and break\r\nthem if possible. No ordinary clevis would hold him. When the pin\r\nwas threaded at one end and screwed into its place, Gunda would\r\nwork at it, hour by hour, until he would start it to unscrewing,\r\nand then his trunk-tip would do the rest. The only clevis that he\r\ncould not open was one in which a stout cotter pin was passed\r\nthrough the end of the clevis-pin and strongly bent.\r\n\r\nThrough reasons emanating in his own savage brain, Gunda took\r\nstrong dislikes to several of our park people. He hated Dick\r\nRichards,--the keeper of Alice. He hated a certain messenger boy,\r\na certain laborer, a painter and Mr. Ditmars. Toward me he was\r\ntolerant, and never rushed at me to kill me, as he always did to\r\nhis pet aversions. He stood in open fear of his own keeper, Walter\r\nThuman, until he had studied out a plan to catch him off his guard\r\nand \"get him.\" Then he launched his long-contemplated attack, and\r\nThuman was almost killed.\r\n\r\nOur present (1921) male African elephant, Kartoum, is not so\r\nhostile toward people, but his insatiable desire is to break and\r\nto smash all of his environment that can be bent or broken. His\r\ningenuity in finding ways to damage doors and gates, and to bend\r\nor to break steel beams, is amazing. His greatest feat consisted\r\nin breaking squarely in two, by pushing with his head, a 90-pound\r\nsteel railroad iron used as the top bar of his fence. He knows the\r\nmechanism of the latch of the ponderous steel door between his two\r\nbox stalls, and nothing but a small pin that only human fingers\r\ncan manipulate suffices to thwart his efforts to control the\r\nlatch.\r\n\r\nKartoum has gone over every inch of surface of his two apartments,\r\nhis doors, gates and fences, to find something that he can break\r\nor damage. The steel linings of his apartment walls, originally\r\nfive feet high, we have been compelled to extend upward to a\r\nheight of nine feet, to save the brick walls from being battered\r\nand disfigured. He has searched his steel fences throughout, in\r\norder to find their weakest points, and concentrate his attacks\r\nupon them. If the sharp-pointed iron spikes three inches long that\r\nare set all over his doors are perfectly solid, he respects them,\r\nbut if one is the least bit loose in its socket, he works at it\r\nuntil he finally breaks it off.\r\n\r\nI invite any Doubting Thomas who thinks that Kartoum does not\r\n\"think\" and \"reason\" to try his own thinking and reasoning at\r\ninventing for Kartoum's door a latch that a keeper can easily and\r\nsurely open and close at a distance of ten feet, and that will be\r\nKartoum-proof. As for ourselves, three or four seemingly\r\nintelligent officers and keepers, and a capable foreman of\r\nconstruction, have all they can do to keep ahead of that one\r\nelephant, so great is his ingenuity in thwarting our ways and\r\nmeans to restrain him.\r\n\r\nIn about two days of effort our elephant keepers taught Gunda to\r\nreceive a coin from the hand of a visitor, or pick it off the\r\nfloor, lift the lid of a high-placed cash-box, drop the coin into\r\nit and ring a bell. This very amusing industry was kept up for\r\nseveral years, but finally it became so popular that it had to be\r\ndiscontinued.\r\n\r\nKeeper Dick Richards easily taught Alice to blow a mouth organ,\r\nand to ring a telephone, to take the receiver off its hook and\r\nhold it to her ear and listen. For years Alice has rendered, every\r\nsummer, valuable services of a serious nature in carrying children\r\nand other visitors around her yard, and only once or twice has she\r\nshown a contrary or obstinate spirit.\r\n\r\nTame elephants never tread on the feet of their attendants or\r\nknock them down by accident; or, at least, no instances of the\r\nkind have come to my knowledge. The elephant's feet are large, his\r\nrange of vision is circumscribed, and his extreme and wholly\r\nvoluntary solicitude for the safety of his human attendants can\r\nnot be due to anything else than independent reasoning. The most\r\nintelligent dog is apt to greet his master by planting a pair of\r\ndirty paws against his coat or trousers. The most sensible\r\ncarriage-horse is liable to step on his master's foot or crowd him\r\nagainst a wall in a moment of excitement; but even inside the\r\nkeddah, with wild elephants all about, and a captive elephant\r\nhemmed in by three or four tame animals, the noosers safely work\r\nunder the bodies and between the feet of the tame elephant until\r\nthe feet of the captive are tied.\r\n\r\nAll who have witnessed the tying of captives in a keddah wherein a\r\nwhole wild herd has been entrapped, testify to the uncanny human-\r\nlike quality of the intelligence displayed by the tame elephants\r\nwho assist in tying, leading out and subjugating the wild\r\ncaptives. They enter into the business with both spirit and\r\nunderstanding, and as occasion requires will deceitfully cajole or\r\nvigorously punish a troublesome captive. Sir Emerson Tennent\r\nasserts that the tame elephants display the most perfect\r\nconception of every movement, both of the object to be attained\r\nand the means to accomplish it.\r\n\r\nMemory in the Elephant. So far as memory may be regarded as an\r\nindex of an animal's mental capacity, the weight of evidence is\r\nmost convincingly creditable to the elephant. As a test of memory\r\nin an animal, we hold that a trained performance surpasses all\r\nothers. During the past forty years millions of people have\r\nwitnessed in either Barnum's or Ringling Brothers' shows, or in\r\nthe two combined, an imitation military drill performed by from\r\ntwelve to twenty elephants which in animals of any other species\r\nwould be considered a remarkable performance. The following were\r\nthe commands given by one trainer, understood and remembered by\r\neach elephant, and executed without any visible hesitation or\r\nmistake. These we will call the\r\n\r\nAccomplishments of Performing Elephants.\r\n\r\n1. Fall in line.\r\n\r\n2. Roll-call. (As each elephant's name is called, he takes his\r\nplace in the ranks).\r\n\r\n3. Present arms. (The trunk is uplifted, with its tip curved\r\nforward and held in that position for a short time.)\r\n\r\n4. Forward, march.\r\n\r\n5. File left, march.\r\n\r\n6. Right about face, march.\r\n\r\n7. Left about face, march.\r\n\r\n8. Right by twos, march.\r\n\r\n9. Double quick, march.\r\n\r\n10. Single file, march.\r\n\r\n11. File right.\r\n\r\n12. Halt.\r\n\r\n13. Ground arms. (All lie down, and lie motionless.)\r\n\r\n14. Attention (All arise.)\r\n\r\n15. Shoulder arms. (All stand up on their hind-legs.)\r\n\r\nIn all, fifteen commands were obeyed by the whole company of\r\nelephants.\r\n\r\nIt being impossible, or at least impracticable, to supply so large\r\na number of animals with furniture and stage properties for a\r\nfurther universal performance, certain individuals were supplied\r\nwith the proper articles when necessary for a continuation of the\r\nperformance, as follows:\r\n\r\n16. Ringing bells.\r\n\r\n17. Climbing up a step-ladder.\r\n\r\n18. Going lame in a fore leg.\r\n\r\n19. Going lame in a hind leg.\r\n\r\n20. Stepping up on a tub turned bottom up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration with\r\ncaption: TAME ELEPHANTS ASSISTING IN TYING A WILD CAPTIVE The\r\ncaptive elephant is marked \"C.\" The tame elephants have been\r\nquietly massed around him to keep him still and to give the\r\nnoosers a chance to work at his legs from under the bodies of the\r\ntame elephants.

Using a handkerchief to wipe the eyes.\r\n\r\n28. Sitting in a chair.\r\n\r\n29. Kneeling, with the fore legs.\r\n\r\n30. Kneeling with the hind legs.\r\n\r\n31. Walking astride a man lying lengthwise.\r\n\r\n32. Stepping over a man lying down.\r\n\r\n33. Forming a pyramid of elephants, by using tubs of various\r\nsizes.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that not all of the acts in the latter part of\r\nthis performance were performed by each one of the elephants who\r\nwent through the military drill, there is no reason to doubt the\r\nentire ability of each individual to be trained to obey the whole\r\nthirty-three commands, and to remember them all accurately and\r\nwithout confusion. The most astonishing feature of the\r\nperformance, aside from the perfect obedience of the huge beasts,\r\nwas their easy confidence and accuracy of memory.\r\n\r\nWe come now to a consideration of the Accomplishments of Working\r\nElephants. In all the timber-forests of southern India every\r\ncaptive elephant is taught to perform all the following acts and\r\nservices, as I have witnessed on many occasions:\r\n\r\n1. To _salaam,_ or salute, by raising the trunk.\r\n\r\n2. To kneel, to receive a load or a passenger.\r\n\r\n3. When standing, to hold up a fore-foot, to serve the driver as a\r\nstep in climbing to his place.\r\n\r\n4. To lie down to be washed, first on one side and then on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n5. To open the mouth. 6. To \"hand up\" any article from the\r\nground to the reach of a person riding.\r\n\r\n7. To pull down an obstructing bough.\r\n\r\n8. To halt.\r\n\r\n9. To back.\r\n\r\n10. To pick up the end of a drag-rope and place it between the\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\n11. To drag a timber.\r\n\r\n12. To kneel and with the head turn a log over, or turn it with\r\nthe tusks if any are present.\r\n\r\n13. To push a log into position parallel with others.\r\n\r\n14. To balance and carry timbers on the tusks, if possessing tusks\r\nof sufficient size.\r\n\r\n15. To \"speak,\" or trumpet.\r\n\r\n16. To work in harness.\r\n\r\nEvery working elephant in India is supposed to possess the\r\nintelligence necessary to the performance of all the acts\r\nenumerated above at the command of his driver, either by spoken\r\nwords, a pressure of the knees or feet, or a touch with the\r\ndriving goad. For the sake of generalization I have purposely\r\nexcluded from this list all tricks and accomplishments which are\r\nnot universally taught to working elephants. We have seen,\r\nhowever, that performing elephants are capable of executing\r\nnearly double the number of acts commonly taught to the workers;\r\nand, while it is useless to speculate upon the subject, it must be\r\nadmitted that, were a trainer to test an elephant's memory by\r\nascertaining the exact number of commands it could remember and\r\nexecute in rotation, the result would far exceed anything yet\r\nobtained. For my own part, I believe it would exceed a hundred.\r\nThe performance in the circus-ring is limited by time and space,\r\nand not by the mental capacity of the elephants.\r\n\r\nComprehension under Training. When we come to consider the\r\ncomparative mental receptivity and comprehension of animals under\r\nman's tuition, we find the elephant absolutely unsurpassed. On\r\naccount of the fact that an elephant is about eighteen years in\r\ncoming to anything like maturity, according to the Indian\r\nGovernment standard for working animals, it is far more economical\r\nand expeditious to catch full-grown elephants in their native\r\njungles, and train them, than it is to breed and rear them. About\r\nninety per cent of all the elephants now living in captivity were\r\ncaught in a wild state and tamed, and of the remainder at least\r\neighty per cent were born in captivity of females that were gravid\r\nwhen captured. It will be seen, therefore, that the elephant has\r\nderived no advantage whatever from ancestral association with man,\r\nand has gained nothing from the careful selection and breeding\r\nwhich, all combined, have made the collie dog, the pointer and the\r\nsetter the wonderfully intelligent animals they are. For many\r\ngenerations the horse has been bred for strength, for speed, or\r\nfor beauty of form, but the breeding of the dog has been based\r\n_chiefly_ on his intelligence as a means to an end. _With\r\nall his advantages, it is to be doubted whether the comprehensive\r\nfaculties of the dog, even in the most exceptional individuals of\r\na whole race, are equal to those of the adult wild elephant fresh\r\nfrom the jungle._\r\n\r\nThe extreme difficulty of teaching a dog _of mature age_ even\r\nthe simplest thing is so well known that it has passed into a\r\nproverb: \"It is hard to teach an old dog new tricks.\" In other\r\nwords, the conditions _must_ be favorable. But what is the\r\ncase with the elephant? The question shall be answered by G. P.\r\nSanderson. In his \"Wild Beasts of India,\" he says: \"_Nor are\r\nthere any elephants which can not be easily subjugated, whatever\r\ntheir size or age. The largest and oldest elephants are frequently\r\nthe most easily tamed, as they are less apprehensive than the\r\nyounger ones._\"\r\n\r\nPhilosophy of the Elephant in Accepting Captivity and Making the\r\nBest of It. The most astounding feature in the education of an\r\nelephant is the suddenness of his transition from a wild and\r\nlawless denizen of the forest to the quiet, plodding, good-\r\ntempered, and cheerful beast of draught or burden. I call it\r\nastounding, because in comparison with what could _not_ be\r\ndone with other wild animals caught when adult, no other word is\r\nadequate to express the difference. The average wild animal caught\r\nfully grown is \"a terror,\" and so far as training is concerned,\r\nperfectly impossible.\r\n\r\nThere takes place in the keddah, or pen of capture, a mighty\r\nstruggle between the giant strength of the captive and the\r\ningenuity of man, ably seconded by a few powerful tame elephants.\r\nWhen he finds his strength utterly overcome by man's intelligence,\r\nhe yields to the inevitable, and accepts the situation\r\nphilosophically. Sanderson once had a narrow escape from death\r\nwhile on the back of a tame elephant inside a keddah, attempting\r\nto secure a wild female. She fought his elephant long and\r\nviciously, with the strength and courage of despair, but finally\r\nshe was overcome by superior numbers. Although her attack on\r\nSanderson in the keddah was of the most murderous description, he\r\nstates that her conduct after her defeat was most exemplary, and\r\nshe never afterward showed any signs of ill-temper.\r\n\r\nMr. Sanderson and an elephant-driver once mounted a full-grown\r\nfemale elephant _on the sixth day after her capture, without\r\neven the presence of a tame animal._ Sir Emerson Tennent\r\nrecords an instance wherein an elephant fed from the hand on the\r\nfirst night of its capture, and in a very few days evinced\r\npleasure at being patted on the head. Such instances as the above\r\ncan be multiplied indefinitely. To what else shall they be\r\nattributed than philosophic reasoning on the part of the elephant?\r\nThe orang-utan and the chimpanzee, so often put forward as his\r\nintellectual superior, when captured alive at any other period\r\nthan that of helpless infancy, are vicious, aggressive, and\r\nintractable not only for weeks and months, but for the remainder\r\nof their lives. Orangs captured when fully adult exhibit the most\r\ntiger-like ferocity, and are wholly intractable.\r\n\r\nIf dogs are naturally superior to elephants in natural intellect,\r\nit should be as easy to tame and educate newly-caught wild dogs or\r\nwolves of mature age, as newly-caught elephants. But, so far from\r\nthis being the case, it is safe to assert that it would be\r\n_impossible_ to train even the most intelligent company of\r\npointers, setters or collies ever got together to perform the\r\nfeats accomplished with such promptness and accuracy by all\r\nregularly trained work elephants.\r\n\r\nThe successful training of all elephants up to the required\r\nworking point is so fully conceded in India that the market value\r\nof an animal depends wholly upon its age, sex, build and the\r\npresence or absence of good tusks. The animal's education is\r\neither sufficient for the buyer, or, if it is not, he knows it can\r\nbe made so.\r\n\r\nPromptness and Accuracy in the Execution of Man's Orders. This is\r\nthe fourth quality which serves as a key to the mental capacity\r\nand mental processes of an animal.\r\n\r\nTo me the most impressive feature of a performance of elephants in\r\nthe circus-ring is the fact that every command uttered is obeyed\r\nwith true military promptness and freedom from hesitation, and so\r\naccurately that an entire performance often is conducted and\r\nconcluded without the repetition of a single command. One by one\r\nthe orders are executed with the most human-like precision and\r\nsteadiness, amounting sometimes to actual nonchalance. Human\r\nbeings of the highest type scarcely could do better. To some\r\nsavage races--for example, the native Australians, the Veddahs of\r\nCeylon, or the Jackoons of the Malay Peninsula, I believe that\r\nsuch a performance would be impossible, even under training. I do\r\nnot believe their minds act with sufficient rapidity and accuracy\r\nto enable a company of them to go through with such a wholly\r\nartificial performance as successfully as the elephants do.\r\n\r\nThe thoughtful observer does not need to be told that the brain of\r\nthe ponderous quadruped acts, as far as it goes, with the same\r\nrapidity and precision as that of an intelligent man,--and this,\r\ntoo, in a performance that is wholly artificial and acquired.\r\nIn the performance of Bartholomew's horses, of which I once kept a\r\nrecord in detail, even the most accomplished members of his troupe\r\noften had to be commanded again and again before they would obey.\r\nA command often was repeated for the fifth or sixth time before\r\nthe desired result was obtained. I noted particularly that not one\r\nof his horses,--which were the most perfectly trained of any ever\r\nseen by me,--was an exception to this rule, or performed his\r\ntasks with the prompt obedience and self-confidence so noticeable\r\nin _each one_ of the sixteen Barnum elephants. The horses\r\nusually obeyed with tardiness and hesitation, and very often\r\nmanifested nervousness and uncertainty.\r\n\r\nIn the mind of the elephant, e. g., _each_ elephant, there\r\nwas no confusion of ideas or lapses of memory, but, on the\r\ncontrary, the mental grasp on the whole subject was so secure and\r\ncomprehensive that the animal felt himself the master of the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nI have never yet seen a performance of trained dogs which could be\r\nconsidered worthy of serious comparison with the accomplishments\r\nof either performing or working elephants. In the matter of native\r\neducational capacity the dog can not on any grounds be considered\r\nthe rival of the elephant. The alleged mental superiority of the\r\ndog is based almost wholly upon his powers of independent\r\nreasoning and observation as exhibited in a state of almost\r\nperfect _freedom._ Until the elephant who has grown to\r\nmaturity under man's influence, is allowed the dog's freedom to\r\nplan and execute, no conclusive comparison between them can be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nMoral Qualities of the Elephant. Finally, we come to a\r\nconsideration of the elephant's moral qualities that have a direct\r\nbearing upon our subject. In India, excepting the professional\r\n\"rogue,\" the elephant bears a spotless reputation for patience,\r\namiability and obedience. The \"rogue\" is an individual afflicted\r\nwith either an incorrigible disposition, or else is afflicted with\r\ninsanity, either temporary or permanent. I know of no instance on\r\nrecord wherein a _normal elephant_ with a _healthy mind_\r\nhas been guilty of unprovoked homicide, or even of attempting it.\r\nI have never heard of an elephant in India so much as kicking,\r\nstriking or otherwise injuring either human beings or other\r\ndomestic animals. There have been several instances, however, of\r\npersons killed by elephants which were temporarily insane, or\r\n\"_must,_\" and also by others permanently insane. In America\r\nseveral persons have been killed in revenge for ill treatment. In\r\nBrooklyn a female elephant once killed a civilian who burned her\r\ntrunk with a lighted cigar. It is the misfortune but not the fault\r\nof the elephant that in advanced age or by want of necessary\r\nexercise, he is liable to be attacked by _must,_ or sexual\r\ninsanity, during which period he is clearly irresponsible for his\r\nacts.\r\n\r\nSo many men have been killed by elephants in this country that of\r\nlate years the idea has been steadily gaining ground that\r\nelephants are naturally ill-tempered, and vicious to a dangerous\r\nextent. Under fair conditions, nothing could be farther from the\r\ntruth. We have seen that in the hands of the \"gentle Hindu\" the\r\nelephant is safe and reliable, and never attacks man except under\r\nthe circumstances already stated. In this country, however, many\r\nan elephant is at the mercy of quick-tempered and sometimes\r\nrevengeful showmen, who very often do not understand the\r\ntemperaments of the animals under their control, and who during\r\nthe traveling season are rendered perpetually ill-tempered and\r\nvindictive by reason of overwork and insufficient sleep. With such\r\nmasters as these it is no wonder that occasionally an animal\r\nrebels, and executes vengeance. In Minneapolis in December an\r\nelephant once went on a rampage through the freezing of its ears.\r\nI am quite convinced that an elephant could by ill treatment be\r\ndriven to insanity, and I have no doubt that this has been done\r\nmany times. Our bad elephant, Gunda, was bad by nature, but\r\nfinally he became afflicted with sexual insanity, for which there\r\nwas no cure. When commanded by man, the elephant will tear a\r\ncriminal limb from limb, or crush him to death with his knees, or\r\ngo out to battle holding a sword in his trunk. He will, when told\r\nto do so, attack his kind with fury and persistence; but in the\r\ncourse of many hours, and even days, spent in watching wild herds,\r\nI never yet saw a single individual show any signs of impatience\r\nor ill-temper toward his fellows.\r\n\r\nIt is safe to say that, thus far, not one half the elephant's\r\nmental capabilities have been developed, or even understood. It\r\nwould be of great interest to determine by experiment the full\r\neducational capacity of this interesting quadruped. It would be\r\nequally interesting to determine the limit of its reasoning\r\npowers in applied mechanics. An animal that can turn a hand-organ\r\nat the proper speed, or ring a telephone and go through the\r\nmotions of listening with a receiver, can be taught to push a\r\nsmoothing-plane invented purposely for him; but whether he would\r\nlearn of himself to plane the rough surface smooth, and let the\r\nsmooth ones remain untouched, is an open question.\r\n\r\nWhile it is generally fruitless and unsatisfactory to enter the\r\nfield of speculation, I can not resist the temptation to assert my\r\nbelief that an elephant can be taught to read written characters,\r\nand also to express some of his own thoughts or states of feeling\r\nin writing. It would be a perfectly simple matter to prepare\r\nsuitable appliances by which the sagacious animal could hold a\r\ncrayon in his trunk, and mark upon a surface adapted to his\r\nconvenience. Many an elephant has been taught to make chalk-marks\r\non a blackboard. In Julian's work on \"The Nature of Animals,\" the\r\neleventh chapter of the second book, he describes in detail the\r\nwonderful performances of elephants at Rome, all of which he saw.\r\nOne passage is of peculiar interest to us, and the following has\r\nbeen given as a translation: \"...I saw them writing letters on\r\nRoman tablets with their trunks, neither looking awry nor turning\r\naside. The hand, however, of the teacher was placed so as to be a\r\nguide in the formation of the letters; and, while it was writing,\r\nthe animal kept its eye fixed down in an accomplished and scholar-\r\nlike manner.\"\r\n\r\nI can conceive how an elephant may be taught that certain\r\ncharacters represent certain ideas, and that they are capable of\r\nintelligent combinations. The system and judgment and patient\r\neffort which developed an active, educated, and even refined\r\nintellect in Laura Bridgman--deaf, dumb and blind from birth--\r\nought certainly to be able to teach a clear-headed, intelligent\r\nelephant to express at least _some_ of his thoughts in\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nI believe it is as much an act of murder to wantonly take the life\r\nof a healthy elephant as to kill a native Australian or a Central-\r\nAfrican savage. If it is more culpable to kill an ignorant human\r\nsavage than an elephant, it is also more culpable to kill an\r\nelephant than an echinoderm. Many men are both morally and\r\nintellectually lower than many quadrupeds, and are, in my opinion,\r\nas wholly destitute of that indefinable attribute called soul as\r\nall the lower animals commonly are supposed to be.\r\n\r\nIf an investigator like Dr. Yerkes, and an educator like Dr. Howe,\r\nshould take it in hand to develop the mind of the elephant to the\r\nhighest possible extent, their results would be awaited with\r\npeculiar interest, and it would be strange if they did not\r\nnecessitate a revision of the theories now common among those who\r\nconcede an immortal soul to every member of the human race, even\r\ndown to the lowest, but deny it to all the animals below man.\r\n\r\nCurvature in the Brain of an Elephant. There is curvature of the\r\nspine; and there is curvature in the brain. It afflicts the human\r\nrace, and all other vertebrates are subject to it.\r\n\r\nIn the Zoological Park we have had, and still have, a persistent\r\ncase of it in a female Indian elephant now twenty-three years of\r\nage, named \"Alice.\" Her mental ailment several times manifested\r\nitself in Luna Park, her former home; but when we purchased the\r\nanimal her former owners carelessly forgot to mention it.\r\n\r\nFour days after Alice reached her new temporary home in our\r\nAntelope House, and while being marched around the Park for\r\nexercise, she heard the strident cry of one of our mountain lions,\r\nand immediately turned and bolted.\r\n\r\nYoung as she was at that time, her two strong and able-bodied\r\nkeepers, Thuman and Bayreuther, were utterly unable to restrain\r\nher. She surged straight forward for the front door of the Reptile\r\nHouse, and into that building she went, with the two keepers\r\nliterally swinging from her ears.\r\n\r\nAs the great beast suddenly loomed up above the crowd of\r\nsightseers in the quiet building, the crowd screamed and became\r\nalmost panic-stricken.\r\n\r\nPartly by her own volition and partly by encouragement, she\r\ncircumnavigated the turtle-bank and went out.\r\n\r\nOnce outside she went where she pleased, and the keepers were\r\nquite unable to control her. Half an hour later she again headed\r\nfor the Reptile House and we knew that she would again try to\r\nenter.\r\n\r\nIn view of the great array of plate glass cases in that building,\r\nmany of them containing venomous cobras, rattlesnakes, moccasins\r\nand bushmasters, we were thoroughly frightened at the prospect of\r\nthat crazy beast again coming within reach of them.\r\n\r\nWith our men fighting frantically, and exhausted by their\r\nprolonged efforts to control her, Alice again entered the Reptile\r\nHouse. As she attempted to pass into the main hall,--the danger\r\nzone,--our men succeeded in chaining her front feet to the two\r\nsteel posts of the guard rail, set solidly in concrete on each\r\nside of the doorway. Alice tried to pull up those posts by their\r\nroots, but they held; and there in front of the Crocodile Pool the\r\nkeepers and I camped for the night. We fed her hay and bread, to\r\nkeep her partially occupied, and wondered what she would do in the\r\nmorning when we would attempt to remove her.\r\n\r\nSoon after dawn a force of keepers arrived. Chaining the\r\nelephant's front feet together so that she could not step more\r\nthan a foot, we loosed the chains from the two posts and ordered\r\nher to come to an \"about face,\" and go out. Instead of doing that\r\nshe determinedly advanced toward the right, and came within reach\r\nof twelve handsome glazed cases of live reptiles that stood on a\r\nlong table. Frantically the men tried to drive her back. For\r\nanswer she put her two front feet on the top bar of the steel\r\nguard rail and smashed ten feet of it to the floor. Then she began\r\nto butt those glass snake cages off their table, one by one.\r\n\r\n_\"Boom!\" \"Bang!\" \"Crash!\"_ they went on the floor, one after\r\nanother. Soon fourteen banded rattlesnakes of junior size were\r\nwriggling over the floor. \"Smash\" went more cases. The Reptile\r\nHouse was in a great uproar. Soon the big wall cases would be\r\nreached, and then--I would be obliged to shoot her dead, to avoid\r\na general delivery of poisonous serpents, and big pythons from\r\ntwenty to twenty-two feet long. The room resounded with our\r\nshouts, and the angry trumpeting of Alice.\r\n\r\nAt last, by vigorous work with the elephant hooks, Alice was\r\nturned and headed out of the building. A foot at a time she passed\r\nout, then headed toward the bear dens. Midway, we steered her in\r\namong some young maple trees, and soon had her front legs chained\r\nto one of them. Alice tried to push it over, and came near to\r\ndoing so.\r\n\r\nThen we quickly tied her hind legs together,--and she was all\r\nours. Seeing that all was clear for a fall, we joyously pushed\r\nAlice off her feet. She went over, and fell prone upon her side.\r\nIn three minutes all her feet were securely anchored to trees, and\r\nwe sat down upon her prostrate body.\r\n\r\nAt that crowning indignity Alice was the maddest elephant in the\r\nworld for that day. We gave her food, and the use of her trunk,\r\nand left her there twenty-four hours, to think it over. She\r\ndeserved a vast beating with canes; but we gave her no punishment\r\nwhatever. It would have served no good purpose.\r\n\r\nDuring the interval we telephoned to Coney Island, and asked Dick\r\nRichards, the former keeper of Alice, to come and reason with her.\r\nPromptly he came,--and he is still guiding as best he can the\r\ncheckered destinies of that erring female.\r\n\r\nWhen Alice was unwound and permitted to arise,--with certain\r\nlimitations as to her progress through the world,--it was evident\r\nthat she was in a chastened mood. She quietly marched to her\r\nquarters at the Antelope House, and there we interned her. But\r\nthat was not all of Alice. Very soon we had to move her to the\r\ncompleted Elephant House, half a mile away. Keeper Richards said\r\nthat two or three times she had bolted into buildings at Luna\r\nPark; so we prepared to overcome her idiosyncrasies by a\r\ncombination of force and strategy. I had the men procure a strong\r\nrope about one hundred feet long, in the middle of which I had\r\nthem fix a very nice steel hook, large enough to hook suddenly\r\naround a post or a tree.\r\n\r\nOne end of that rope we tied to the left foot of Charming Alice,\r\nand the remainder of the rope was carried out at full length in\r\nfront of her.\r\n\r\nWillingly enough she started from the Antelope House, and Richards\r\nled her about three hundred feet. Then she stopped, and\r\ndisregarding all advice and hooks, started to come about, to\r\nreturn to the Antelope House. Quickly the anchor was hooked around\r\nthe nearest fence post, and Alice fetched up against a force\r\nstronger than herself. She was greatly annoyed, but in a few\r\nminutes decided to go on.\r\n\r\nAnother lap of two hundred feet, and the same act was repeated,\r\nwithout the slightest variation.\r\n\r\nThis process continued for nearly half a mile. By that time we\r\nwere opposite the Elk House and Alice had become wild with baffled\r\nrage. She tried hard to smash fences and uproot trees.\r\n\r\nAt last she stood still and refused to move another foot; and then\r\nwe played our ace of trumps. Near by, twenty laborers were\r\nworking. Calling all hands, they took hold of that outstretched\r\nrope, and heading straight for the new Elephant House started a\r\nnew tug of war. Every \"heave-ho\" of that hilarious company meant a\r\nthree-foot step forward for Gentle Alice,--willy-nilly. As she\r\nraged and roared, the men heaved and laughed. A yard at a time\r\nthey pulled that fatal left foot, into the corral and into the\r\napartment of Alice; and she had to follow it.\r\n\r\nEver since that time, Alice has been permanently under arrest, and\r\nconfined to her quarters; but within the safe precincts of two\r\nsteel-bound yards she carries children on her back, and in summer\r\nearns her daily bread.\r\n\r\nElephant Mentality in the Jungle. Mr. A. E. Ross, while\r\nCommissioner of Forests in Burma, had many interesting experiences\r\nwith elephants, and he related the following:\r\n\r\nA bad-tempered mahout who had been cruel to his work-elephant\r\nfinally so enraged the animal that it attempted to take revenge.\r\nTo forestall an accident, the mahout was discharged, and for two\r\nyears he completely disappeared. After that lapse of time he\r\nquietly reappeared, looking for an engagement. As the line of\r\nelephants stood at attention at feeding time, with a score of\r\npersons in a group before them, the elephant instantly recognized\r\nthe face of his old enemy, rushed for him, and drove him out of\r\nthe camp.\r\n\r\nAn ill-tempered and dangerous elephant, feared by everybody, once\r\nhad the end of his trunk nearly cut off in an accident. While the\r\nanimal was frantic with the pain of it, Mr. Ross ordered him to\r\nlie down. As the patient lay in quiet submission, he dressed the\r\nwound and put the trunk in rude bamboo splints. The elephant\r\nwisely aided the amateur elephant doctor until the wound healed;\r\nand afterward that once dangerous animal showed dog-like affection\r\nfor Mr. Ross.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nTHE MENTAL AND MORAL TRAITS OF BEARS\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidered as a group, the bears of the world are supremely\r\ninteresting animals. In fact, no group surpasses them save the\r\nOrder Primates, and it requires the enrollment of all the apes,\r\nbaboons and monkeys to accomplish it.\r\n\r\nFrom sunrise to sunrise a bear is an animal of original thought\r\nand vigorous enterprise. Put a normal bear in any new situation\r\nthat you please, he will try to make himself master of it. Use any\r\nnew or strange material that you please, of wood, metal, stone or\r\nconcrete, and he will cheerfully set out to find its weakest\r\npoints and destroy it. If one board in a wall happens to be of\r\nwood a little softer than its fellows, with wonderful quickness\r\nand precision he will locate it. To tear his way out of an\r\nordinary wooden cage he asks nothing better than a good crack or a\r\nsoft knot as a starting point.\r\n\r\nLet him who thinks that all animals are mere machines of heredity\r\nand nothing more, take upon himself the task of collecting,\r\nyarding, housing and KEEPING a collection of thirty bears from all\r\nover the world, representing from ten to fifteen species. In a\r\nvery short time the believer in bear knowledge by inheritance\r\nonly, will begin to see evidences of new thought.\r\n\r\nIn spite of our best calculations, in twenty-two years and a total\r\nof about seventy bears, we have had three bear escapes. The\r\nspecies involved were an Indian sloth bear, an American black bear\r\nand a Himalayan black bear. The troublesome three laboriously\r\ninvented processes by which, supported by surpassing acrobatics,\r\nthey were able to circumvent our overhanging bars. Now, did the\r\nmothers of those bears bequeath to them the special knowledge\r\nwhich enabled them to perform the acrobatic mid-air feat of\r\nwarping themselves over that sharp-pointed overhang barrier? No;\r\nbecause none of their parents ever saw steel cage-work of any\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nUniversal Traits. The traits common to the majority of bear\r\n_species_ as we see them manifested in captivity are the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\nFirst, playfulness; second, spasmodic treachery; third,\r\ncontentment in comfortable captivity; fourth, love of water;\r\nfifth, enterprise in the mischievous destruction of things that\r\ncan be destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe bears of the world are distributed throughout Asia, Borneo,\r\nthe heavy forests of Europe, all North America, and the\r\nnorthwestern portion of South America. In view of their\r\nwonderfully interesting traits, it is surprising that so few books\r\nhave been written about them. The variations in bear character\r\nand habit are almost as wide as the distribution of the species.\r\n\r\nThere are four books in English that are wholly devoted to\r\nAmerican bears and their doings. These are \"The Grizzly Bear\" and\r\n\"The Black Bear,\" by William H. Wright, of Spokane(Scribner's),\r\n\"The Grizzly Bear,\" by Enos A. Mills, and \"The Adventures of James\r\nCapen Adams.\" In 1918 Dr. C. Hart Merriam published as No. 41 of\r\n\"North American Fauna\" a \"Review of the Grizzly and Brown Bears of\r\nNorth America\" (U.S. Govt.). This is a scientific paper of 135\r\npages, the product of many years of collecting and study, and it\r\nrecognizes and describes eighty-six species and sub-species of\r\nthose two groups in North America. The classification is based\r\nchiefly upon the skulls of the animals.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that up to date no bear student with a tireless\r\npen has written The Book of Bears. But let no man rashly assume\r\nthat he knows \"all about bears.\" While many bears do think and act\r\nalong certain lines, I am constantly warning my friends, \"Beware\r\nof the Bear! You never can tell what he will do next.\" I hasten to\r\nstate that of all the bears of the world, the \"pet\" bear is the\r\nmost dangerous.\r\n\r\nA Story of a \"Pet\" Bear. In one of the cities of Canadaa\r\ngentleman greatly interested in animals kept a young bear cub, as\r\na pet; and once more I say--if thine enemy offend thee, present\r\nhim with a black-bear cub. The bear was kept in a back yard,\r\nchained to a post, and after his first birthday that alleged \"pet\"\r\ndominated everything within his circumpolar region.\r\n\r\nOne day a lady and gentleman called to see the pet, to observe how\r\ntame and good-natured it was. The owner took on his arm a basket\r\nof tempting apples, and going into the bear's territory proceeded\r\nto show how the Black One would eat from his owner's hand.\r\n\r\nThe bear was given an apple, which was promptly eaten. The owner\r\nreached for a second, but instead of accepting it, the bear\r\ninstantly became a raging demon. He struck Mr. C. a lightning-\r\nquick and powerful blow upon his head, ripping his scalp open.\r\nWith horrible growls and bawling, the beast, standing fully erect,\r\nstruck again and again at his victim, who threw his arms across\r\nhis face to save it from being torn to pieces. Fearful blows from\r\nthe bear's claw-shod paws rained upon Mr. C.'s head, and his scalp\r\nwas almost torn away. In the melee he fell, and the bear pounced\r\nupon him, to kill him.\r\n\r\nThe visiting gentleman rushed for a club. Meanwhile the lady\r\nvisitor, rendered frantic by the sight of the bear killing her\r\nhost, did a very brave but suicidally dangerous thing. She\r\n_seized the hindquarters_ of the bear, gripping the fur in\r\nher bare hands, and actually dragged the animal off its victim!\r\nFortunately at that dangerous juncture the lady's husband rushed\r\nup with a club, beat the raging animal as it deserved, and\r\nmastered it.\r\n\r\nThe owner of the bear survived his injuries, and by a great effort\r\nthe surgeons saved his scalp. A \"pet\" bear in its second year\r\nmay become the most dangerous of all wild animals. This is\r\nbecause it _seems_ so affectionate and docile, and yet is\r\nliable to turn in one second,--and without the slightest warning,\r\n--into a deadly enemy.\r\n\r\nScores of times we have seen this quick change in temper take\r\nplace in bears inhabiting our dens. Four bears will be quietly and\r\npeacefully consuming their bread and vegetables when,--\r\n\"_biff!_\" Like a stroke of lightning a hairy right arm shoots\r\nout and lands with a terriffic jolt on the head of a peaceful\r\ncompanion. The victim roars,--in surprise, pain and protest, and\r\nthen a fight is on. The aggressor roars and bawls, and follows up\r\nhis blow as if to exterminate his perfectly inoffensive cage-mate.\r\n\r\nMean and cruel visitors are fond of starting bear fights by\r\nthrowing into the cages tempting bits of fruit, or peanuts; and\r\nsometimes a peach stone kills a valuable bear by getting jammed in\r\nthe pyloric orifice of the stomach.\r\n\r\nThe owners of bears should NEVER allow visitors to throw food to\r\nthem. Unlimited feeding by visitors will spoil the tempers of the\r\nbest bears in the world.\r\n\r\nPower of Expression in Bears. Next to the apes and monkeys, I\r\nregard bears as the most demonstrative of all wild animals. The\r\naverage bear is proficient in the art of expression. The position\r\nof his ears, the pose of his head and neck, the mobility of his\r\nlips and his walking or his resting attitudes all tell their\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nTo facial and bodily expression the bear adds his voice; and\r\nherein he surpasses most other wild animals! According to his mood\r\nhe whines, he threatens, or warns by loud snorting. He roars with\r\nrage, and when in pain he cries, or he bawls and howls. In\r\naddition to this he threatens an enemy by snapping his jaws\r\ntogether with a mighty ominous clank, accompanied by a warning\r\nnasal whine. An angry bear will at times give a sudden rake with\r\nhis claws to the ground, or the concrete on which he stands.\r\nNow, with all this facility for emotional expression, backed by an\r\nalert and many-sided mind, boundless energy and a playful\r\ndisposition, is it strange that bears are among the most\r\ninteresting animals in the world?\r\n\r\nBears in Captivity. With but few exceptions the bears of the world\r\nare animals with philosophic minds, and excellent reasoning power,\r\nthough rarely equal to that of the elephant. One striking proof of\r\nthis is the promptness with which adult animals accept\r\n_comfortable_ captivity, and settle down in contentment.\r\nWhat we mean by comfortable captivity very shortly will be\r\ndefined.\r\n\r\nNo bear should be kept in a cage with stone walls and an uneven\r\nfloor; nor without a place to climb; and wherein life is a daily\r\nchapter of inactive and lonesome discomfort and unhappiness. The\r\nold-fashioned bear \"pit\" is an abomination of desolation, a sink-\r\nhole of misery, and all such means of bear torture should be\r\nbanished from all civilized countries.\r\n\r\nHe who cannot make bears comfortable, contented and happy should\r\nnot keep any.\r\n\r\nA large collection of bears of many species properly installed may\r\nbe relied upon to reveal many variations of temperament and\r\nmentality, from the sanguine and good-natured stoic to the\r\nhysterical demon. Captivity brings out many traits of character\r\nthat in a wild state are either latent or absent.\r\n\r\nProminent Traits of Prominent Species. After twenty years of daily\r\nobservation we now know that\r\n\r\nThe grizzly is the most keen-minded species of all bears.\r\n\r\nThe big Alaskan brown bears are the least troublesome in\r\ncaptivity.\r\n\r\nThe polar bear lives behind a mask, and is not to be trusted.\r\n\r\nThe black bear is the nearest approach to a general average in\r\nursine character.\r\n\r\nThe European brown bears are best for training and performances.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese black bear is nervous, cowardly and hysterical; the\r\nlittle Malay sun bear is the most savage and unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe Lesson of the Polar and Grizzly. The polar bears of the north,\r\nand the Rocky Mountain grizzlies, a hundred years ago were bold\r\nand aggressive. That was in the days of the weak, small-bore,\r\nmuzzle-loading rifles, black powder and slow firing. Today all\r\nthat is changed. All those bears have recognized the fearful\r\ndeadliness of the long-range, high-power repeating rifle, and the\r\npolar and the grizzly flee from man at the first sight of him,\r\nfast and far. No grizzly attacks a man unless it has been\r\nattacked, or wounded, or cornered, or _thinks_ it is\r\ncornered. As an exception, Mr. Stefansson observed two or three\r\npolar bears who seemed to be quite unacquainted with man, and but\r\nlittle afraid of him.\r\n\r\nThe great California grizzly is now believed to be totally\r\nextinct. The campaign of Mr. J. A. McGuire, Editor of _Outdoor\r\nLife_ Magazine, to secure laws for the reasonable protection of\r\nbears, is wise, timely and thoroughly deserving of success because\r\nsuch laws are now needed. The bag limit on grizzlies this side of\r\nAlaska should be one per year, and no trapping of grizzlies should\r\nbe permitted anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe big brown bears of Alaska have not yet recognized the true\r\ndeadliness of man. They have vanquished so many Indians, and\r\ninjured or killed so many white men that as yet they are unafraid,\r\ninsolent, aggressive and dangerous. They need to be shot up so\r\nthoroughly that they will learn the lesson of the polars and\r\ngrizzlies,--that man is a dangerous animal, and the only safe\r\ncourse is to run from him at first sight.\r\n\r\nBears Learn the Principles of Wild Life Protection. Ordinarily\r\nboth the grizzlies and black bears are shy, suspicious and\r\nintensely \"wild\" creatures; and therefore the quickness and\r\nthoroughness with which they learn that they are in sanctuary is\r\nall the more surprising. The protected bears of the Yellowstone\r\nPark for years have been to tourists a source of wonder and\r\ndelight. The black bears are recklessly trustful, and familiar\r\nquite to the utmost limits. The grizzlies are more reserved, but\r\nthey have done what the blacks have very wisely not done. They\r\nhave broken the truce of protection, and attacked men on their\r\nown ground.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, of several attacks made upon camping parties, the\r\nmost serious and most nearly fatal was that of 1917 upon Ned\r\nFrost, the well-known guide of Cody, Wyoming, and his field\r\ncompanion. They were sleeping under their wagon, well wrapped from\r\nthe cold in heavy blankets and comfortables, and it is to their\r\nbedding alone that they owe their lives. They were viciously\r\nattacked by a grizzly, dragged about and mauled, and Frost was\r\nseriously bitten and clawed. Fortunately the bedding engaged the\r\nactivities of their assailant sufficiently that the two men\r\nfinally escaped alive.\r\n\r\nHow Buffalo Jones Disciplined a Bad Grizzly. The most ridiculous\r\nand laughable performance ever put up with a wild grizzly bear as\r\nan actor was staged by Col. C. J.(\"Buffalo\") Jones when he was\r\nsuperintendent of the wild animals of the Yellowstone Park. He\r\nmarked down for punishment a particularly troublesome grizzly that\r\nhad often raided tourists' camps at a certain spot, to steal food.\r\nVery skilfully he roped that grizzly around one of his hind legs,\r\nsuspended him from the limb of a tree, and while the disgraced and\r\noutraged silver-tip swung to and fro, bawling, cursing, snapping,\r\nsnorting and wildly clawing at the air, Buffalo Jones whaled it\r\nwith a bean-pole until he was tired. With commendable forethought\r\nMr. Jones had for that occasion provided a moving-picture camera,\r\nand this film always produces roars of laughter.\r\n\r\nNow, here is where we guessed wrongly. We supposed that whenever\r\nand wherever a well-beaten grizzly was turned loose, the angry\r\nanimal would attack the lynching party. But not so. When Mr.\r\nJones' chastened grizzly was turned loose, it thought not of\r\nreprisals. It wildly fled to the tall timber, plunged into it, and\r\nthere turned over a new leaf.  I  once said: \"C. J., you ought to shoot\r\nsome of those grizzlies, and teach all the rest of them to behave\r\nthemselves.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration with caption: WILD\r\nBEARS QUICKLY RECOGNIZE PROTECTION The truce of the black bears of\r\nthe Yellowstone Park. The grizzlies are not nearly so trustful.\r\nPhotographed by Edmund Heller, 1921. (All rights reserved.)]\r\n\r\n\"I know it!\" he responded, \"I know it! But Col. Anderson won't let\r\nme: He says that if we did, some people would make a great fuss\r\nabout it; and I suppose they would.\"\r\n\r\nRecently, however, it has been found imperatively necessary to\r\nteach the Park grizzlies a few lessons on the sanctity of a\r\nsanctuary, and the rights of man.\r\n\r\nWe will now record a few cases that serve to illustrate the mental\r\ntraits of bears.\r\n\r\nCase I. The Steel Panel. Two huge male Alaskan brown bears, Ivan\r\nand Admiral, lived in adjoining yards. The partition between them\r\nconsisted of panels of steel. The upper panels were of heavy bar\r\niron. The bottom panels, each four feet high and six feet long,\r\nwere of flat steel bars woven into a basket pattern. The ends of\r\nthese flat bars had been passed through narrow slots in the heavy\r\nsteel frame, and firmly clinched. We would have said that no land\r\nanimal smaller than an elephant could pull out one of those\r\npanels.\r\n\r\nBy some strange aberration in management, one day it chanced that\r\nAdmiral's grizzly bear wife was introduced for a brief space into\r\nIvan's den. Immediately Admiral went into a rage, on the ground\r\nthat his constitutional rights had been infringed. At once he set\r\nto work to recover his stolen companion. He began to test those\r\npartition panels, one by one. Finally he found the one that seemed\r\nto him least powerful, and he at once set to work to tear it out\r\nof its frame.\r\n\r\nThe keepers knew that he could not succeed; but he thought\r\ndifferently. Hooking his short but very powerful claws into the\r\nmeshes he braced backward and pulled. After a fierce struggle an\r\nupper corner yielded. Then the other corner yielded; and at last\r\nthe whole upper line gave way.\r\n\r\nI reached the scene just as he finished tearing both ends free. I\r\nsaw him bend the steel panel inward, crush it down with his\r\nthousand pounds of weight, and dash through the yawning hole into\r\nhis rival's arena.\r\n\r\nThen ensued a great battle. The two huge bears rose high on their\r\nhind legs, fiercely struck out with their front paws, and fought\r\nmouth to mouth, always aiming to grip the throat. They bit each\r\nother's cheeks but no serious injuries were inflicted, and very\r\nsoon by the vigorous use of pick-handles the two bear keepers\r\ndrove the fighters apart.\r\n\r\nCase 2. Ivan's Begging Scheme. Ivan came from Alaska when a small\r\ncub and he has long been the star boarder at the Bear Dens. He is\r\nthe most good-natured bear that we have, and he has many thoughts.\r\nHaving observed the high arm motion that a keeper makes in\r\nthrowing loaves of bread over the top of the nine-foot cage work,\r\nIvan adopted that motion as part of his sign language when food is\r\nin sight outside. He stands up high, like a man, and with his left\r\narm he motions, just as the keepers do. Again and again he waves\r\nhis mighty arm, coaxingly, suggestively, and it says as plain as\r\nprint: \"Come on! Throw it in! Throw it!\"\r\n\r\nIf there is too much delay in the response, he motions with his\r\nright paw, also, both arms working together. It is irresistible.\r\nAt least 500 times has he thus appealed, and he will do it\r\nwhenever a loaf of bread is held up as the price of an exhibition\r\nof his sign language. Of course Ivan thought this out himself, and\r\nput it into practice for a very definite purpose.\r\n\r\nCase 3. Ivan's Invention for Cracking Beef Bones. Ivan invented a\r\nscheme for cracking large beef bones, to get at the ultimate\r\nmorsels of marrow. He stands erect on his hind feet, first holds\r\nthe picked bone against his breast, then with his right paw he\r\npoises it very carefully upon the back of his left paw. When it is\r\nwell balanced he flings it about ten feet straight up into the\r\nair. When it falls upon the concrete floor a sufficient number of\r\ntimes it breaks, and Ivan gets his well-earned reward. This same\r\nplan was pursued by Billy, another Alaskan brown bear. Case 4. A\r\nBear's Ingenious Use of a Door. When Admiral is annoyed and chased\r\ndisagreeably by either of his two cage-mates he runs into his\r\nsleeping-den, slams the steel door shut from the inside, and thus\r\nholds his tormentors completely at bay until it suits him to roll\r\nthe door back again and come out. At night in winter when he goes\r\nto bed he almost always shuts the door tightly from within, and\r\nkeeps it closed all night. He does not believe in sleeping-\r\nporches, nor wide-open windows in sleeping-quarters.\r\n\r\nCase 5. Admiral Will Not Tolerate White Boots. Recently our bear\r\nkeepers have found that Admiral has violent objections to boots of\r\nwhite rubber. Keeper Schmidt purchased a pair, to take the place\r\nof his old black ones, but when he first wore them into the den\r\nfor washing the floor the bear flew at him so quickly and so\r\nsavagely that he had all he could do to make a safe exit. A second\r\ntrial having resulted similarly, he gave the boots a coat of black\r\npaint. But one coat was not wholly satisfactory to Admiral. He saw\r\nthe hated white through the one coat of black, promptly registered\r\n\"disapproval,\" and the patient keeper was forced to add another\r\ncoat of black. After that the new boots were approved.\r\n\r\nCase 6. The Mystery of Death. Once upon a time we had a Japanese\r\nblack bear named Jappie, quartered in a den with a Himalayan black\r\nbear,--the species with long, black side-whiskers and a white tip\r\nto its chin. The Japanese bear was about one-third smaller than\r\nthe Himalayan black.\r\n\r\nOne night the Japanese bear died, and in the morning the keepers\r\nfound it lying on the level concrete top of the sleeping dens.\r\n\r\nAt once they went in to remove the body; but the Himalayan black\r\nbear angrily refused to permit them to touch it. For half an hour\r\nthe men made one effort after another to coax, or entice or to\r\ndrive the guardian bear away from the dead body, but in vain. When\r\nI reached the strange and uncanny scene, the guardian bear was in\r\na great rage. It took a position across the limp body, and from\r\nthat it fiercely refused to move or to be driven. As an experiment\r\nwe threw in a lot of leaves, and the guardian promptly raked them\r\nover the dead one and stood pat.\r\n\r\nWe procured a long pole, and from a safe place on the top of the\r\nnearest overhang, a keeper tried to prod or push away the guardian\r\nof the dead. The living one snarled, roared, and with savage vigor\r\nbit the end of the pole. By the time the bear was finally enticed\r\nwith food down to the front of the den, and the body removed,\r\nseven hours had elapsed.\r\n\r\nNow, what were the ideas and emotions of the bear? One man can\r\nanswer about as well as another. We think that the living bear\r\nrealized that something terrible had happened to its cage-mate,--\r\nin whom he never before had manifested any guardianship\r\ninterest,--and he felt called upon to defend a friend who was very\r\nmuch down and out. It was the first time that he had encountered\r\nthe great mystery, Death; and whatever it was, he resented it.\r\n\r\nCase 7. A Terrible Punishment. Once we had a particularly mean\r\nand vicious young Adirondack black bear named Tommy. In a short\r\ntime he became known as Tommy the Terror. We put him into a big\r\nyard with Big Ben, from Florida, and two other bears smaller than\r\nBen, but larger than himself.\r\n\r\nIn a short time the Terror had whipped and thoroughly cowed Bruno\r\nand Jappie. Next he tackled Ben; but Ben's great bulk was too much\r\nfor him. Finally he devoted a lot of time to bullying and reviling\r\n_through the bars_ a big but good-natured cinnamon bear,\r\nnamed Bob, who lived in the next den. In all his life up to that\r\ntime, Bob had had only one fight. Tommy's treatment of Bob was so\r\nirritating to everybody that it was much remarked upon; and\r\npresently we learned how Bob felt about it.\r\n\r\nOne morning while doing the cage work, the keeper walked through\r\nthe partition gate from Bob's den into Tommy's. He slammed the\r\niron gate behind him, as usual, but this time the latch did not catch\r\nas usual. In a moment Bob became aware of this unstable condition.\r\nVery innocently he sauntered up to the gate, pushed it open, and\r\nwalked through into the next den. The keeper was then twenty feet\r\naway, but a warning cry from without set him in motion to stop\r\nthe intruder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration\r\nwith caption: ALASKAN BROWN BEAR \"IVAN\" BEGGING FOR FOOD He\r\ninvented the very expressive sign language that he employs.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration with caption: THE MYSTERY OF DEATH. Himalayan bear\r\njealously guarding the body of a dead cage-mate.]\r\n\r\nHaving no club to face, Bob quietly ignored the keeper's broom.\r\nPaying not the slightest attention to the three inoffensive\r\nbears, Bob fixed his gaze on the Terror, at the far end of the\r\nden, then made straight for him. Tommy made a feeble attempt at\r\ndefense, but Bob seized him by the back, bit him, and savagely\r\nshook him as a terrier shakes a rat. The Terror yelled lustily\r\n\"Murder! Murder! Help!\" but none of the other bears made a move\r\nfor his defense. Bob was there to give Tommy the punishment that\r\nwas due him for his general meanness and his insulting behavior.\r\n\r\nThe horrified keeper secured his pike-pole, with a stout spike set\r\nin the end for defense, and drove the spike into Bob's shoulder.\r\nBob went right on killing the Terror. Again the keeper drove in\r\nhis goad, and blood flowed freely; but Bob paid not the slightest\r\nattention to this severe punishment.\r\n\r\nThen the keeper began to beat the cinnamon over the nose; and that\r\nmade him yield. He gave the Terror a parting shake, let him go,\r\nand with a bloody shoulder deliberately walked out of that den and\r\ninto his own. The punishment of the Terror went to the full limit,\r\nand we think all those bears approved it. In a few hours he died\r\nof his injuries.\r\n\r\nCase 8. The Grizzly Bear and the String. One of the best\r\nillustrations I know of the keenness and originality of a wild\r\nbear's mind and senses, is found in Mr. W. H. Wright's account of\r\nthe grizzly bear he did not catch with an elk bait and two set\r\nguns, in the Bitter Root Mountains. This story is related in\r\nChapter VI.\r\n\r\nCase 9. Silver King's Memory of His Capture. At this moment we\r\nhave a huge polar bear who refuses to forget that he was captured\r\nin the water, in Kane Basin, and who now avoids the water in his\r\nswimming pool, almost as much as any burned child dreads fire.\r\nThroughout the hottest months of midsummer old Silver King lies on\r\nthe rock floor of his huge and handsome den, grouching and\r\ngrumbling, and not more than once a week enjoying a swim in his\r\nspacious pool. No other polar bear of ours ever manifested such an\r\naversion for water. The other polar bears who have occupied that\r\nsame den loved that pool beyond compare, and used to play in its\r\nwaters for hours at a time. Evidently the chase of Silver King\r\nthrough green arctic water and over ice floes, mile after mile,\r\nhis final lassoing, and the drag behind a motor boat to the ship\r\nwere, to old Silver King, a terrible tragedy. Now he regards all\r\ndeep water as a trap to catch bears, but, strange to relate, the\r\nwinter's snow and ice seem to renew his interest in his swimming\r\npool. Occasionally he is seen at play in the icy water, and toying\r\nwith pieces of ice.\r\n\r\nMemory in Bears. I think that ordinarily bear memory for human\r\nfaces and voices is not long. Once I saw Mr. William Lyman\r\nUnderwood test the memory of a black bear that for eighteen months\r\nhad been his household pet and daily companion. After a\r\nseparation of a year, which the bear spent in a public park near\r\nBoston, Mr. Underwood approached, alone, close up to the bars of\r\nhis cage. He spoke to him in the old way, and called him by his\r\nold name, but the bear gave absolutely no sign of recognition or\r\nremembrance.\r\n\r\nHow a Wild Grizzly Bear Caches Food. The silver-tip grizzly bear\r\nof the Rocky Mountains has a mental trait and a corresponding\r\nhabit which seems to be unique in bear character. It is the habit\r\nof burying food for future use. Once I had a rare opportunity to\r\nobserve this habit. It was in the Canadian Rockies of British\r\nColumbia, in the month of September(1905), while bears were very\r\nactivism. John M. Phillips and I shot two large white goats,\r\none of which rolled down a steep declivity and out upon the slide-\r\nrock, where it was skinned. The flensed body of the other was\r\nrolled over the edge of a cliff, and fell on a brushy soil-covered\r\nspot about on the same level as the remains of goat No. 1.\r\n\r\nThe fresh goat remains were promptly discovered by a lusty young\r\ngrizzly, which ate to satiety from Goat No. 1. With the remains\r\nof. Goat No. 2 the grizzly industriously proceeded to establish a\r\ncache of meat for future use.\r\n\r\nThe goat carcass was dragged to a well chosen spot of seclusion\r\non moss-covered earth. On the steep hillside a shallow hole was\r\ndug, the whole carcass rolled into it, and then upon it the bear\r\npiled nearly a wagon load of fresh earth, moss, and green plants\r\nthat had been torn up by the roots. Over the highest point of the\r\ncarcass the mass was twenty-four inches deep. On the ground the\r\ncache was elliptical in shape, and its outline measured about\r\nseven by nine feet. On the lower side it was four feet high, and\r\non the upper side two feet. The cache was built around two larch\r\nsaplings, as if to secure their support. On the uphill side of the\r\ncache the ground was torn up in a space shaped like a half moon,\r\ntwenty-eight feet long by nineteen wide.\r\n\r\nI regard that cache as a very impressive exhibit of ursine\r\nthought, reasoning and conclusion. It showed more fore-thought\r\nand provision, and higher purpose in the conservation of food than\r\nsome human beings ever display, even at their best. The plains\r\nIndians and the buffalo hunters were horribly wasteful and\r\nimprovident. _The impulse of that grizzly was to make good use\r\nof every pound of that meat, and to conserve for the future._\r\n\r\nSurvival of the Bears.--The bears of North America have survived\r\nthirty thousand years after the lions and the sabre-toothed tigers\r\nof La Brea perished utterly and disappeared. But there were bears\r\nalso in those days, as the asphalt pits reveal. Now, why did not\r\nall the bears of North America share the fate of the lions and the\r\ntigers? It seems reasonable to answer that it was because the\r\nbears were wiser, more gifted in the art of self-preservation, and\r\nmore resourceful in execution. In view of the omnivorous menu of\r\nbears, and their appalling dependence upon small things for food,\r\nit is to me marvelous that they now maintain themselves with such\r\nastounding success.\r\n\r\nA grizzly will dig a big and rocky hole three or four feet deep to\r\nget one tiny ground-squirrel, a tidbit so small that an adult\r\ngrizzly could surely eat one hundred of them, like so many plums,\r\nat one sitting. A bear will feed on berries under such handicaps\r\nthat one would not be surprised to see a bear starve to death in a\r\nberry-patch.\r\n\r\nBut almost invariably the wild bear when killed is fairly well fed\r\nand prosperous; and I fancy that no one ever found a bear that had\r\ndied of cold and exposure. The cunning of the black bear in self-\r\npreservation surpasses that of all other large mammal species of\r\nNorth America save the wolf, the white-tailed deer and the coyote.\r\nIn the game of self-preservation I will back that quartet against\r\nall the other large land animals of North America.\r\n\r\nWhat Constitutes Comfortable Captivity. It is impossible for any\r\nman of good intelligence to work continuously with a wild animal\r\nwithout learning something of its thoughts and its temper.\r\n\r\nIn our Zoological Park, day by day and hour by hour our people\r\ncarry into practical effect their knowledge of the psychology of\r\nour mammals, birds and reptiles. In view of the work that we have\r\ndone during the past twenty-one years of the Park's history, we do\r\nnot need to apologize for claiming to know certain definite things\r\nabout wild animal minds. It is my belief that nowhere in the world\r\nis there in one place so large an aggregation of dangerous beasts,\r\nbirds and reptiles as ours. And yet accidents to our keepers from\r\nthem have been exceedingly few, and all have been slight save\r\nfour.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years ago I endeavored to plan for the Zoological\r\nSociety the most humane and satisfactory bear dens on earth.\r\nFortunately we knew something about bears, both wild and captive.\r\nNever before have we written out the exact motif of those dens,\r\nbut it is easily told. We endeavored to give each bear the\r\nfollowing things:\r\n\r\nA very large and luxurious den, open to the sky, and practically\r\non a level with the world;\r\n\r\nPerfect sanitation;\r\n\r\nA great level playground of smooth concrete;\r\n\r\nHigh, sloping rocks to climb upon when tired of the level floor;\r\n\r\nA swimming pool, always full and always clean;\r\n\r\nOpenwork steel partitions between cages, to promote sociability\r\nand cheerfulness;\r\n\r\nPlenty of sunlight, but an adequate amount of shade;\r\n\r\nDry and dark sleeping dens with wooden floors, and\r\n\r\n_Close-up views of all bears for all visitors._\r\n\r\nIf there are anywhere in the wilds any bears as healthy, happy and\r\nas secure in their life tenure as ours, I do not know of them. The\r\nwild bear lives in hourly fear of being shot, and of going to bed\r\nhungry.\r\n\r\nThe service of our bear dens is based upon our knowledge of bear\r\npsychology. We knew in the beginning that about 97 per cent of our\r\nbears would come to us as cubs, or at least when quite young, and\r\nwe decided to take full advantage of that fact. All our bears save\r\nhalf a dozen all told, have been trained to permit the keepers of\r\nthe dens to go into their cages, and to _make no fuss about\r\nit._ The bears know that when the keepers enter to do the\r\nmorning housework, or at any other time for any other purpose,\r\nthey must at once climb up to the gallery, above the sleeping\r\ndens, and stay there until the keepers retire. A bear who is slow\r\nabout going up is sternly ordered to \"Go on!\" and if he shows any\r\ninclination to disobey, a heavy hickory pick-handle is thrown at\r\nhim with no uncertain hand.\r\n\r\nNow, in grooming a herd of bears, a hickory pick-handle leaves no\r\nroom for argument. If it hits, it hurts. If it does not hit a\r\nbear, it strikes the concrete floor or the rocks with a resound\r\nand a rebound that frightens the boldest bear almost as much as\r\nbeing hit. So the bear herd wisely climbs up to the first balcony\r\nand sits down to wait. No bear ever leaps down to attack a keeper.\r\nThe distance and the jolt are not pleasant; and whenever a bear\r\ngrows weary and essays to climb down, he is sternly ordered back.\r\nThe keepers are forbidden to permit any familiarities on the part\r\nof their bears.\r\n\r\nAll the bears, save one, that have come to us fully grown, and\r\nsavage, have been managed by other methods, involving shifting\r\ncages.\r\n\r\nOn two occasions only have any of our keepers been badly bitten in\r\nour bear dens. Both attacks were due to over-trustfulness of\r\n\"petted\" bears, and to direct disobedience of fixed orders.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning I laid down this law for our keepers, and\r\nhave repeated it from year to year.\r\n\r\n\"_Make no pets of animals large enough to become dangerous._\r\nMake every animal understand and admit day by day that you are\r\nabsolute master, that it has got to obey, and that if it disobeys,\r\nor attacks you, _you will kill it!_\"\r\n\r\nFamiliarity with a dangerous wild animal usually breeds contempt\r\nand attack.\r\n\r\nTimidity is so fatal that none but courageous and determined men\r\nshould be chosen, _or be permitted,_ to take care of\r\ndangerous animals.\r\n\r\nIn every zoological garden heroic deeds are common; and the men\r\ntake them all as coming in the day's work. Men in positions of\r\ncontrol over zoological parks and gardens should recognize it as a\r\nsolemn duty to provide good salaries for all men who take care of\r\nlive wild mammals, birds and reptiles. _A man who is in daily\r\ndanger of getting hurt should not every waking hour of his life be\r\nharried and worried by poverty in his home._\r\n\r\nLet me cite one case of real heroism in our bear dens, which went\r\nin with \"the day's work,\" as many others have done. Keeper Fred\r\nSchlosser thought it would be safe to take our official\r\nphotographer, Mr. E. R. Sanborn, into the den of a European brown\r\nbear mother, to get a close-up photograph of her and her cubs.\r\nSchlosser felt sure that Brownie was \"all right,\" and that he\r\ncould prevent any accident.\r\n\r\nBut near the end of the work the mother bear drove her cubs into\r\ntheir sleeping den and then made a sudden, vicious and most\r\nunexpected attack upon Keeper Schlosser. She rushed him, knocked\r\nhim down, seized him by his thigh, bit him severely, and then\r\nactually began _to drag him_ to the door of her sleeping den!\r\n(Just _why_ she did this I cannot explain!)\r\n\r\nHeroically ignoring the great risk to himself, and thinking of\r\nnothing but saving Schlosser, Mr. Sanborn seized the club that had\r\nfallen from the keeper's hand when he fell, rushed up to the\r\nenraged bear and beat her over the head so savagely and so\r\nskilfully that she was glad to let go of her victim and retreat\r\ninto her den. Then Mr. Sanborn seized Schlosser, dragged him away\r\nfrom the den, and stood guard over him until help came.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nMENTAL TRAITS OF A FEW RUMINANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we wish to cover with a single word the hoofed and horned\r\n\"big game\" of the world, we say Ruminants. That easy and\r\ncomprehensive name embraces (1) the Bison and Wild Cattle, (2) the\r\nSheep, Goats, Ibexes and Markhors, (3) the Deer Family and (4) the\r\nAntelope Family. These groups must be considered separately,\r\nbecause the variations in mind and temperament are quite well\r\nmarked; but beyond wisdom in self-preservation, I do not regard\r\nthe intelligence of wild ruminants as being really great.\r\n\r\nIntellectually the ruminants are not as high as the apes and\r\nmonkeys, bears, wolves, foxes and dogs, the domestic horses and\r\nthe elephants. They are handicapped by feet that are good for\r\nlocomotion and defense, but otherwise are almost as helpless as so\r\nmany jointed sticks. This condition closes to the ruminants the\r\npossibility of a long program of activities which the ruminant\r\nbrain might otherwise develop. The ruminant hoof and leg is well\r\ndesigned for swift and rough travel, for battles with distance,\r\nsnow, ice, mud and flood, and for a certain amount of fighting,\r\nbut they are inept for the higher manifestations of brain power.\r\n\r\nBecause of this unfortunate condition, the study of ruminants in\r\ncaptivity does not yield a great crop of results. The free wild\r\nanimals are far better subjects, and it is from them that we have\r\nderived our best knowledge of ruminant thoughts and ways. It is\r\nnot possible, however, to set forth here any more than a limited\r\nnumber of representative species.\r\n\r\nTHE BISON AND WILD CATTLE. The American Bison.--Through the age-\r\nlong habit of the American bison to live in large herds, and to\r\nfeel, generation after generation, the sense of personal security\r\nthat great numbers usually impart, the bison early acquired the\r\nreputation of being a stolid or even a stupid animal. Particularly\r\nwas this the case in the days of the greatest bison destruction,\r\nwhen a still-hunter could get \"a stand\" on a bunch of buffaloes\r\nquietly grazing at the edge of the great mass, and slowly and\r\nsurely shoot down each animal that attempted to lead that group\r\naway from the sound of his rifle.\r\n\r\nDuring that fatal period the state of the buffalo mind was nothing\r\nless than a tragedy. \"The bunch\" would hear a report two hundred\r\nyards away, they would see a grazing cow suddenly and mysteriously\r\nfall, struggle, kick the air, and presently lie still. The\r\nindividuals nearest dully wondered what it was all about. Those\r\nfarthest away looked once only, and went on grazing. If an\r\nexperienced old cow grew suspicious and wary, and quietly set out\r\nto walk away from those mysterious noises, \"bang!\" said the\r\nMystery once more, and she would be the one to fall. On this\r\nmurderous plan, a lucky and experienced hunter could kill from\r\ntwenty to sixty head of buffaloes, mostly cows, on a space of\r\nthree or four acres. The fatal trouble was that each buffalo felt\r\nthat the presence of a hundred or a thousand others feeding close\r\nby was an insurance of _security_ to the individual, and so\r\nthere was no stampede.\r\n\r\nBut after all, the bison is not so big a fool as he looks. He can\r\nthink; and he can _learn._\r\n\r\nIn 1886, when we were about to set out for Montana to try to find\r\na few wild buffaloes for the National Museum, before the reckless\r\ncowboys could find, kill and waste absolutely the last one, a\r\nhilarious friend said:\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw! You don't need to take any rifles! Just get a rusty old\r\nrevolver, mount a good, sensible horse, ride right up alongside\r\nthe lumbering old beasts, and shoot them down at arm's length.\"\r\nWe went; but not armed with \"a rusty old revolver.\" We found a few\r\nbuffaloes, but ye gods! How changed they were from the old days!\r\nAlthough only two short years had elapsed since the terminal\r\nslaughter of the hundreds of thousands whose white skeletons then\r\nthickly dotted the Missouri-Yellowstone divide, _they had\r\nlearned fear of man,_ and also how to preserve themselves from\r\nthat dangerous wild beast. They sought the remotest bad lands,\r\nthey hid in low grounds, they watched sharply during every\r\ndaylight hour, and whenever a man on horseback was sighted they\r\nwere off like a bunch of racers, for a long and frantic run\r\nstraight away from the trouble-maker. Even at a distance of two\r\nmiles, or as far as they could see a man, they would run from\r\nhim,--not one mile, or two, but five miles, or seven or eight\r\nmiles, to another wild and rugged hiding-place.\r\n\r\nTo kill the buffalo specimens that we needed, three cowboys and\r\nthe writer worked hard for nearly three months, and it was all\r\nthat we could do to outwit those man-scared bison, and to get near\r\nenough to them to kill what we required. Many a time, when weary\r\nfrom a long chase, I thought with bitter scorn of my friend with\r\nthe rusty-old-revolver in his mind. No deer, mountain sheep,\r\ntiger, bears nor elephants,--all of which I have pursued (and\r\nsometimes overtaken!)--were ever more wary or keen in self-\r\npreservation than those bison who _at last_ had broken out\r\nfrom under the fatal spell of herd security. I am really glad that\r\nthis strange turn of Fortune's wheel gave me the knowledge of the\r\ntrue scope of the buffalo mind before the last chance had passed.\r\n\r\nWhat did a wild buffalo do when he found himself with a broken\r\nleg, and unable to travel, but otherwise sound? Did he go limping\r\nabout over the landscape, to attract enemies from afar, and be\r\nquickly shot by a man or torn to pieces by wolves? Not he! With\r\nthe keen intelligence of the wounded wild ruminant, he chose the\r\nline of least resistance, and on three legs fled downhill. He went\r\non down, and kept going, until he reached the bottom of the\r\nbiggest and most tortuous coulee in his neighborhood. And then\r\nwhat? Instead of coming to rest in a reposeful little valley a\r\nhundred feet wide, he chose the most rugged branch he could find,\r\nthe one with the steepest and highest banks, and up that dry bed,\r\nwith many a twist and turn, he painfully limped his way. At last\r\nhe found himself in a snug and safe ditch, precisely like a front\r\nline trench seven feet wide, with perpendicular walls and zig-\r\nzagging so persistently that the de'il himself could not find him\r\nsave by following him up to close quarters, and landing upon his\r\nhorns. There, without food or water, the wounded animal would\r\nstand for many days,--in fact, until hunger would force him back\r\nto the valley's crop of grass. His wild remedy was to _keep\r\nstill,_ and give that broken leg its chance to knit and grow\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\nI have seen in buffalo skeletons healed bone fractures that filled\r\nus with wonder. One case that we shot was a big and heavy bull\r\nwhose hip socket had been utterly smashed, femur head and all, by\r\na heavy rifle ball; but the bull had escaped in spite of his\r\nwound, and he had nursed it until it had healed in _good working\r\norder._ We can testify that he could run as well as any of the\r\nbisons in his bunch.\r\n\r\nOf course young bisons can be tamed, and to a certain extent\r\neducated. \"Buffalo\" Jones broke a pair of two-year-old bulls to\r\nwork under a yoke, and pull a light wagon. He tried them with\r\nbridles and bits, but the buffaloes refused to work with them.\r\nWith tight-fitting halters, and the exercise of much-muscle, he\r\nwas able for a time to make them \"gee\" and \"haw.\" But not for\r\nlong. When they outgrew his ability in free-hand drawing, he\r\nrigged an upright windlass on each side of his wagon-box, and\r\nfirmly attached a line to each. When the team was desired to\r\n\"gee,\" he deftly wound up the right line on its windlass, and vice\r\nversa for \"haw.\"\r\n\r\nBut even this did not last a great while. The motor control was\r\nmore tentative than absolute. Once while driving beside a creek on\r\na hot and thirsty day, the super-heated buffaloes suddenly espied\r\nthe water, twenty feet or so below the road. Without having been\r\nbidden they turned toward it, and the windlass failed to stop\r\nthem. Over the cut bank they went, wagon, man and buffalo bulls,\r\n\"in one red burial blent.\" Although they secured their drink,\r\ntheir reputation as draught oxen was shattered beyond repair, and\r\nthey were cashiered the service.\r\n\r\nElsewhere I have spoken of the bison's temper and temperament.\r\n\r\nTHE WILD SHEEP.--It takes most newly-captured adult mountain sheep\r\nabout six months in palatial zoo quarters to get the idea out of\r\ntheir heads that every man who comes near them, even including the\r\nman who feeds and waters them, is going to kill them, and that\r\nthey must rush wildly to and fro before it occurs. But there are\r\nexceptions.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, wild herds soon learn the large difference\r\nbetween slaughter and protection, and thereafter accept man's hay\r\nand salt with dignity and persistence. The fine big-horn\r\nphotographs that have been taken of _wild_ sheep herds on\r\npublic highways just outside of Banff, Alberta, tell their own\r\nstory more eloquently than words can do. The photograph of wild\r\nsheep, after only twenty-seven years of protection, feeding in\r\nherds in the main street of Ouray, Colorado, is an object lesson\r\nnever to be forgotten by any student of wild animal psychology.\r\nAnd can any such student look upon such a picture and say that\r\nthose animals have not thought to some purpose upon the important\r\nquestion of danger and safety to sheep?\r\n\r\nIs there anyone left who still believes the ancient and bizarre\r\nlegend that mountain sheep rams jump off cliffs and alight upon\r\ntheir horns? I think not. People now know enough about anatomy,\r\nand the mental traits of wild sheep, to know that nothing of that\r\nkind ever occurred save by a dreadful accident, followed by the\r\ndeath of the sheep. No spinal column was ever made by Nature or\r\ndeveloped by man that could endure without breaking a headforemost\r\nfall from the top of a cliff to the slide-rock bottom thereof.\r\n\r\nIn Colorado, in May 1907, the late Judge D. C. Beaman of Denver\r\nsaw a big-horn ram which was pursued by dogs to the precipitous\r\nend of a mountain ridge, take a leap for life into space from top\r\nto bottom. The distance straight down was \"between twenty and\r\ntwenty-five feet.\" The ram went down absolutely upright, with his\r\nhead fully erect, and his feet well apart. He landed on the slide\r\nrock on his feet, broke no bones, promptly recovered himself and\r\ndashed away to safety. Judge Beaman declared that \"the dogs were\r\nafraid to approach even as near as the edge of the cliff at the\r\npoint from which the sheep leaped off.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Muir held the opinion that the legend of horn-landing sheep\r\nwas born of the wild descent of frightened sheep down rocks so\r\nsteep that they _seemed_ perpendicular but were not, and the\r\nsheep, after touching here and there in the wild pitch sometimes\r\nlanded in a heap at the bottom,--quite against their will. To me\r\nthis has always seemed a reasonable explanation.\r\n\r\nThe big-horn sheep has one mental trait that its host of ardent\r\nadmirers little suspect. It does not like pinnacle rocks, nor\r\nnarrow ledges across perpendicular cliffs, nor dangerous climbing.\r\nIt does not \"leap from crag to crag,\" either up, down or across.\r\nGo where you will in sheep hunting, nine times out of ten you will\r\nfind your game on perfectly safe ground, from which there is very\r\nlittle danger of falling.\r\n\r\nIn spirit and purpose the big-horns are great pioneers and\r\nexplorers. They always want to see what is on the other side of\r\nthe range. They will sight a range of far distant desert\r\nmountains, and to see what is there will travel by night across\r\nten or twenty miles of level desert to find out.\r\n\r\nIt was in the Pinacate Mountains of northwestern Mexico, on the\r\neastern shore of the head of the Gulf of California, that we made\r\nour most interesting observations on wild big-horn sheep. On those\r\nblack and blasted peaks and plains of lava, where nature was\r\nworking hard to replant with desert vegetation a vast volcanic\r\narea, we found herds of short-haired, undersized big-horn sheep,\r\nstruggling to hold their own against terrific heat, short food and\r\nlong thirst. It is a burning shame that since our discovery of\r\nthose sheep hunters of a dozen different kinds have almost\r\nexterminated them.\r\n\r\nWe saw one band of seventeen sheep, close to Pinacate Peak, all so\r\nutterly ignorant of the ways of men that they practically refused\r\nto be frightened at our presence and our silent guns. We watched\r\nthem a long time, forgetful of the flight of time. They were not\r\nshrewdly suspicious of danger. They fed, and frolicked, and dozed,\r\nas much engrossed in their indolence as if the world contained no\r\ndangers for them.\r\n\r\nOne day Mr. John M. Phillips and I shot two rams, for the Carnegie\r\nMuseum; and the next morning I had the most remarkable lesson that\r\nI ever learned in mountain sheep psychology.\r\n\r\nEarly on that November morning Mr. Jeff Milton and I left our\r\nchilly lair in a lava ravine, and most foolishly left both our\r\nrifles at our camp. Hobbling along on foot we led a pack mule over\r\nhalf a mile of rough and terrible lava to a dead sheep. There we\r\nquickly skinned the animal, packed the skin and a horned head upon\r\nthe upper deck of our mule, and started back to camp, leading our\r\nassistant. Half way back we looked westward across an eighth of a\r\nmile of rough, black lava, and saw standing on a low point a fine\r\nbig-horn ram. He stood in a statuesque attitude, facing us, and\r\nfixedly gazing at us. He was trying to make out what we were, and\r\nto determine why a perfectly good pair of sheep horns should grow\r\nout of the back of a sorrel mule! Ethically he had a right to be\r\npuzzled.\r\n\r\nMr. Milton and I were greatly annoyed by the absence of our\r\nrifles; and he proposed that we should leave the mule where he\r\nstood, go back to our camp, get our guns, and kill the sheep. Now,\r\neven then I was quite well up on the subject of curiosity in wild\r\nanimals, and I knew to a minute what to count upon as the standing\r\nperiod of sheep, goat or deer. As gently as possible I informed\r\nMilton that _no_ sheep would ever stand and look at a sorrel\r\nmule for the length of time it would take us to foot it over that\r\nlava to camp, and return.\r\n\r\nBut my companion was optimistic, and even skeptical.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe he will, now!\" he persisted. \"Let's try it. I think he may\r\nwait for us.\"\r\n\r\nMuch against my judgment, and feeling secretly rebellious at the\r\nfolly of it all, I agreed to his plan,--solely to be \"a good\r\nsport,\" and to play his game. But _I_ knew that the effort\r\nwould be futile, as well as exhausting. Jeff tied the mule, for\r\nthe sheep to contemplate.\r\n\r\nWe went and got those rifles. We were gone fully twenty minutes.\r\nWhen we again reached the habitat of the mule, _that ram was\r\nstill there!_ Apparently he had not moved a muscle, nor stirred\r\na foot, nor even batted an eye. Talk about curiosity in a wild\r\nanimal! He was a living statue of it.\r\n\r\nHe continued to hold his pose on his lava point while we stalked\r\nhim under cover of a hillock of lava, and shot him,--almost half\r\nan hour after we first saw him. He had been overwhelmingly puzzled\r\nby the uncanny sight of a pair of curling horns like his own,\r\ngrowing out of the back of a long-eared sorrel mule which he felt\r\nhad no zoological right to wear them. He did his level best to\r\nthink it out; he became a museum specimen in consequence, and he\r\nhas gone down in history as the Curiosity Ram.\r\n\r\nMental Attitude of Captured Big-Horn Sheep. In 1906 an\r\nenterprising and irrepressible young man named Will Frakes took\r\nthe idea into his head that he must catch some mountain sheep\r\nalive, and do it alone and single-handed. Presently he located a\r\nfew _Ovis nelsoni_ in the Avawatz Mountains near Death\r\nValley, California. Finding a water hole to which mountain sheep\r\noccasionally came at night to drink, he set steel traps around it.\r\nOne by one he caught five sheep of various ages, but chiefly\r\nadults. The story of this interesting performance is told in\r\n_Outdoor Life_ magazine for March, April and May, 1907.\r\n\r\nI am interested in the mental processes of those sheep as they\r\ncame in close contact with man, and were compelled by force of\r\ncircumstances to accept captivity. Knowing, as all animal men do,\r\nthe fierce resistance usually made by adult animals to the\r\ntransition from freedom to captivity, I was prepared to read that\r\nthose nervous and fearsome adult sheep fought day by day until\r\nthey died.\r\n\r\nBut not so. Those sheep showed clear perceptive faculties and good\r\njudgment. They were quick to learn that they were conquered, and\r\nwith amazing resignation they accepted the new life and its\r\nstrange conditions. In describing the chase on foot in thick\r\ndarkness of a big old male mountain sheep with a steel trap fast\r\non his foot, Mr. Frakes says:\r\n\r\n\"A sheep's token of surrender is to lie down and lie still. Once\r\nhe 'possums, no matter what you do, or how badly you may hurt him,\r\nhe will never flinch. And when this sheep (\"Old Stonewall\") was\r\nthrown down by the trap, he evidently thought that he was\r\ncaptured, and lay still for a few minutes before he found out the\r\ndifference, which gave me time to come up with him.... So I went\r\nto camp, got a trap clamp and some sacks, made a kind of sled and\r\ndragged him in. It was just midnight when I got him tied down, and\r\njust sun-up when I got to camp with him. I fixed him up the best\r\nI could, stood him up beside the other big-horn and took their\r\npictures. He looked so \"rough and ready\" that I named him \"Old\r\nStonewall.\" But for all his proud, defiant bearing he has always\r\nbeen a good sheep, _and never tried to fight me._ Still he\r\ncan hit quick and hard when he wants to, and I have to keep him\r\ntied up all the time to keep him from killing the other bucks.\"\r\n\r\nNow, I know not what conclusion others will draw from the above\r\nclear and straightforward recital, but to me it established in\r\n_Ovis nelsoni_ a reputation for quick thinking, original\r\nreasoning and sound conclusions. In an incredibly short period\r\nthose animals came up to the status of tame animals. The five\r\nsheep caught by Mr. Frakes were suddenly confronted by new\r\nconditions, such as their ancestors had never even dreamed of\r\nmeeting; and _all of them reacted in the same way._ That was\r\nmore than \"animal behavior.\" It was Thought, and Reason!\r\n\r\nTHE GOATS. White Mountain Goat.--I never have had any opportunity\r\nto study at length, in the wilds, the mental traits of the\r\nmarkhors, ibexes, gorals or serows. I have however, enjoyed rare\r\nopportunities with the white Rocky Mountain goat, on the summits\r\nof the Canadian Rockies as well as in captivity.\r\n\r\nWhere we were, on the Elk River Mountains of East Kootenay, the\r\ngoats had little fear of man. They did not know that we were in\r\nthe group of the world's most savage predatory animals, and we\r\npuzzled them. Fourteen of them once leisurely looked down upon us\r\nfrom the edge of a cliff, and silently studied us for a quarter of\r\nan hour. An hour later three of them ran through our camp. One\r\nmorning an old billy calmly lay down to rest himself on the\r\nmountain side about 300 feet above our tents. At last, however, he\r\nbecame uneasy, and moved away.\r\n\r\nThis goat is not a timid and fearsome soul, ready to go into a\r\npanic in the presence of danger. The old billy believes that the\r\nbest defense is a vigorous offense. On the spot where Cranbrook,\r\nB. C., now stands, an old billy was caught unawares on an open\r\nplain and surrounded by Indians, dogs and horses. In the battle\r\nthat ensued he so nearly whipped the entire outfit that a squaw\r\nrushed wildly to the rescue with a loaded rifle, to enable the Red\r\narmy to win against the one lone goat.\r\n\r\nIn those mountains the white goat, grizzly bear, mountain sheep,\r\nmule deer and elk all live together, in perfect liaison, and never\r\nbut once have I heard of the goat getting into a fight with a\r\njoint-tenant species. A large silver-tip grizzly rashly attacked a\r\nfull-grown billy, and managed to inflict upon him mortal injuries.\r\nBefore he fell, however, the goat countered by driving his little\r\nskewer-sharp black horns into the vitals of the grizzly with such\r\njudgment and precision that the dead grizzly was found by Mr. A.\r\nB. Fenwick quite near the dead goat.\r\n\r\nWe know that the mountain goat is a good reasoner in certain life-\r\nor-death matters affecting himself.\r\n\r\nHe knows no such thing as becoming panic-stricken from surprise or\r\nfear. An animal that looks death in the face every hour from\r\nsunrise until sunset is not to be upset by trifles. We have seen\r\nthat if a dog and several men corner a goat on a precipice ledge,\r\nand hem him in so that there is no avenue of escape, he does not\r\ngrow frantic, as any deer or most sheep would do, and plunge off\r\ninto space to certain death. Not he. He stands quite still, glares\r\nindignantly upon his enemies, shakes his head, occasionally grits\r\nhis teeth or stamps a foot, but otherwise waits. His attitude and\r\nhis actions say:\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is your move. What are you going to do next?\"\r\n\r\nMost captive ruminants struggle frantically when put into crates\r\nfor shipment. White goats very rarely do so. They recognize the\r\ninevitable, and accept it with resignation. Captive antelopes and\r\ndeer often kill themselves by dashing madly against wire fences,\r\nbut I never knew a white goat to injure itself on a fence. Many a\r\nwild animal has died from fighting its shipping crate; but no wild\r\ngoat ever did so. A white goat will walk up a forty-five degree\r\nplank to the roof of his house, climb all over it, and joyously\r\nperch on the peak; but no mountain sheep or deer of ours ever did\r\nso. _They are afraid!_ Only the Himalayan tahr equals the\r\nwhite goat in climbing in captivity, and it will climb into the\r\nlower branches of an oak tree, just for fun.\r\n\r\nOf all the ruminant animals I know intimately, the white mountain\r\ngoat is the philosopher-in-chief. Were it not so, how would it be\r\npossible for him to live and thrive, and attain happiness, on the\r\nsavage and fearsome summits that form his chosen home? We\r\nmust bear in mind that the big-horn does not dare to risk\r\nthe haunts and trails of his white rivals. Hear the Cragmaster of\r\nthe Rockies:\r\n\r\n[Illustration with caption: THE STEADY-NERVED AND COURAGEOUS\r\nMOUNTAIN GOAT He refused to be stampeded off his ledge by men or\r\ndog. Photographed at eight feet by John M. Phillips (1905).]\r\n\r\n\"On dizzy ledge of mountain wall, above the timber-line I\r\nhear the riven slide-rock fall toward the stunted pine. Upon\r\nthe paths I tread secure no foot dares follow me, For I am\r\nmaster of the crags, and march above the scree.\"\r\n\r\nIn other chapters I have referred to the temperament and logic of\r\nthis animal, the bravest mountaineer of all America.\r\n\r\nTHE DEER.--In nervous energy the species of the Deer Family vary\r\nall the way from the nervous and hysterical barasingha to the\r\nsensible and steady American elk that can successfully be driven\r\nin harness like a horse. As I look over the deer of all nations I\r\nam bound to award the palm for sound common-sense and reasoning\r\npower to the elk.\r\n\r\nA foolishly nervous deer seldom takes time to display high\r\nintelligence. Naturally we dislike men, women, children or wild\r\nanimals who are always ready to make fools of themselves,\r\nstampede, and disfigure the landscape.\r\n\r\nThe Axis Deer is quietly sensible,--so long as there is no\r\ncatching to be done. Try to catch one, and the whole herd goes off\r\nlike a bomb. Many other species are similar. No wild deer could\r\nact more absurdly than does the axis, the barasingha and fallow,\r\neven after generations have been bred in captivity.\r\n\r\nThe Malay Sambar Deer of the Zoological Park have one droll trait.\r\nThe adult bucks bully and browbeat the does, in a rather mild way,\r\nso long as their own antlers are on their heads. But when those\r\nantlers take their annual drop, \"O, times! O, manners! What a\r\nchange!\" The does do not lose a day in flying at them, and taking\r\nrevenge for past tyranny. They strike the hornless bucks with\r\ntheir front feet, they butt them, and they bite out of them\r\nmouthfuls of hair. The bucks do not seem, to know that they can\r\nfight without their antlers, and so the tables are completely\r\nturned. This continues until the new horns grow out, the velvet\r\ndries and is rubbed off,--and then quickly the tables are turned\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nNo other deer species of my personal acquaintance has ever\r\nequalled the American elk of Wyoming in recognizing man's\r\nprotection and accepting his help in evil times. It is not only a\r\nfew wise ones, or a few half-domestic bands, but vast wild herds\r\nof thousands that every winter rush to secure man's hay in the\r\nJackson Hole country, south of the Yellowstone Park. No matter how\r\nshy they _all_ are in the October hunting season, in the bad\r\ndays of January and February they know that the annual armistice\r\nis on, and it means hay for them instead of bullets. They swarm in\r\nthe level Jackson Valley, around S. N. Leek's famous ranch and\r\nothers, until you can see a square mile of solid gray-yellow\r\nliving elk bodies. Mr. Leek once caught about 2,500 head in one\r\nphotograph, all hungry. They crowd around the hay sleds like\r\nhungry horses. In their greatest hunger they attack the ranchmen's\r\nhaystacks, just as far as the stout and high log fences will\r\npermit them to go, and many a kind-hearted ranchman has robbed his\r\nown haystacks to save the lives of starving and despairing elk.\r\n\r\nThe Yellowstone Park elk know the annual shooting and feeding\r\nseasons just as thoroughly as do the men of Jackson Hole.\r\n\r\nOnce there was a bold and hardy western man who trained a bunch of\r\nelk to dive from a forty-foot high platform into a pool of water.\r\nI say that he \"trained\" them, because it really was that. The\r\nanimals quickly learned that the plunge did nothing more than to\r\nshock and wet them, and so they submitted to the part they had to\r\nplay, with commendable resignation. Some deer would have fought\r\nthe program every step of the way, and soon worn themselves out;\r\nbut elk, and also horses, learn that the diving performance is all\r\nin the day's work; which to me seems like good logic. A few\r\npersons believe that such performances are cruel to the animals\r\nconcerned, but the diving alone is not necessarily so.\r\n\r\nSome deer have far too much curiosity, too much desire to know\r\n\"What is that?\" and \"What is it all about?\" The startled mule deer\r\nleaps out, jumps a hundred feet or more at a great pace, then\r\nfoolishly stops and looks back, to gratify his curiosity. That is\r\nthe hunter's chance; and that fatal desire for accurate\r\ninformation has been an important contributory cause to the\r\nextermination of the mule deer, or Rocky Mountain \"black-tail,\"\r\nthroughout large areas. In the Yellowstone Park the once-wild\r\nherds of mule deer have grown so tame under thirty years of\r\nprotection that they completely overrun the parade ground, the\r\nofficers' quarters, and even enter porches and kitchens for food.\r\n\r\nSeveral authors have remarked upon the habits of the elephant,\r\nllama and guanaco in returning to the same spot; and this reminds\r\nme of a coincidence in my experience that few persons will believe\r\nwhen I relate it.\r\n\r\nIn the wild and weird bad-lands of Hell Creek, Montana, I once\r\nwent out deer hunting in company with the original old hermit\r\nwolf-hunter of that region, named Max Sieber. With deep feeling\r\nMax told me of a remarkable miss that he had made the previous\r\nyear in firing at a fine mule deer buck from the top of a small\r\nbutte; for which I gave him my sympathy.\r\n\r\nIn the course of our morning's tramp through the very bad-lands\r\nthat were once the ancestral home of the giant carnivorous\r\ndinosaur, yclept _Tyrannosaurus rex,_ we won our way to the\r\nfoot of a long naked butte. Then Sieber said, very kindly:\r\n\r\n\"If you will climb with me up to the top of this butte I will show\r\nyou where I missed that big buck.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not an alluring proposition, and I thought things that I\r\ndid not speak. However, being an Easy Mark, I said cheerfully,\r\n\"All right, Max. Go ahead and show me.\"\r\n\r\nWe toiled up to a much-too-distant point on the rounded summit,\r\nand as Max slowed up and peered down the farther side, he pointed\r\nand began to speak.\r\n\r\n\"He was standing right down there on that little patch of bare--\r\nwhy!\" he exclaimed. \"_There's a dee-er there now!_ But it's a\r\ndoe! Get down! Get down!\" and he crouched. Then I woke up and\r\nbecame interested.\r\n\r\n\"It is _not_ a doe, Max. I see horns!\"--Bang!\r\n\r\nAnd in another five seconds a fine buck lay dead on the very spot\r\nwhere Sieber's loved and lost buck had stood one year previously.\r\nBut that was only an unbelievable coincidence,--unbelievable to\r\nall save old Max.\r\n\r\nThe natural impulse of the mule deer of those bad-lands when\r\nflushed by a hunter is to _run over a ridge,_ and escape over\r\nthe top; but that is bad judgement and often proves fatal. It\r\nwould be wiser for them to run _down,_ to the bottoms of\r\nthose gashed and tortuous gullies, and escape by zig-zagging along\r\nthe dry stream beds.\r\n\r\nThe White-Tailed, or Virginia Deer is the wisest member of the\r\nDeer Family in North America, and it will be our last big-game\r\nspecies to become extinct. It has reduced self-preservation to an\r\nexact science.\r\n\r\nIn areas of absolute protection it becomes very bold, and breeds\r\nrapidly. Around our bungalow in the wilds of Putman County, New\r\nYork, the deer come and stamp under our windows, tramp through our\r\ngarden, feed in broad daylight with our neighbor's cattle, and\r\njauntily jump across the roads almost anywhere. They are beautiful\r\nobjects, in those wild wooded landscapes of lake and hill.\r\n\r\nBut in the Adirondacks, what a change! If you are keen you may see\r\na few deer in the closed season, but to see in the hunting season\r\na buck with good horns you must be a real hunter. As a skulker and\r\nhider, and a detector of hunters, I know no deer equal to the\r\nwhite-tail. In making a safe get-away when found, I will back a\r\nbuck of this species against all other deer on earth. He has no\r\nfatal curiosity. He will not halt and pose for a bullet in order\r\nto have a look at you. What the startled buck wants is more space\r\nand more green bushes between the Man and himself.\r\n\r\nThe Moose is a weird-looking and uncanny monster, but he knows one\r\nline of strategy that is startling in its logic. Often when a bull\r\nmoose is fleeing from a long stern chase,--always through wooded\r\ncountry,--he will turn aside, swing a wide semicircle backward,\r\nand then lie down for a rest close up to leeward of his trail.\r\nThere he lies motionless and waits for man-made noises, or man\r\nscent; and when he senses either sign of his pursuer, he silently\r\nmoves away in a new direction.\r\n\r\nThe Antelopes of the Old World. The antelopes, gazelles, gnus and\r\nhartebeests of Africa and Asia almost without exception live in\r\nherds, some of them very large. Owing to this fact their minds are\r\nas little developed, individually, as the minds of herd animals\r\ngenerally are. The herd animal, relying as it does upon its\r\nleaders, and the security that large numbers always seem to\r\nafford, is a creature of few independent ideas. It is not like the\r\ndeer, elk, sheep or goat that has learned things in the hard\r\nschool of solitude, danger and adversity, with no one on whom to\r\nrely for safety save itself. The basic intelligence of the average\r\nherd animal can be summed up in one line:\r\n\r\n\"Post your sentinels, then follow your leader.\"\r\n\r\nJudging from what hunters in Africa have told me, the hunting of\r\nmost kinds of African antelopes is rather easy and quiet long-\r\nrange rifle work. In comparison with any sheep, goat, ibex,\r\nmarkhor and even deer hunting, it must be rather mild sport. A\r\nlevel grassy plain with more or less bushes and small trees for\r\nuse in stalking is a tame scenario beside mountains and heavy\r\nforests, and it seems to me that this sameness and tameness of\r\nhabitat naturally fails to stimulate the mental development of the\r\nwild habitants. In captivity, excepting the keen kongoni, or\r\nCoke hartebeest, and a few others, the old-world antelopes are\r\nmentally rather dull animals. They seem to have few thoughts, and\r\nseldom use what they have; but when attacked or wounded the roan\r\nantelope is hard to finish. In captivity their chief exercise\r\nconsists in rubbing and wearing down their horns on the iron bars\r\nof their indoor cages, but I must give one of our brindled gnus\r\nextra credit for the enterprise and thoroughness that he displayed\r\nin wrecking a powerfully-built water-trough, composed of concrete\r\nand porcelain. The job was as well done as if it had been the work\r\nof a big-horn ram showing off. But that was the only exhibition of\r\nits kind by an African antelope.\r\n\r\nThe Alleged \"Charge\" of the Rhinoceros. For half a century African\r\nhunters wrote of the assaults of African rhinoceroses on caravans\r\nand hunting parties; and those accounts actually established for\r\nthat animal a reputation for pugnacity. Of late years, however,\r\nthe evil intentions of the rhinoceros have been questioned by\r\nseveral hunters. Finally Col. Theodore Roosevelt firmly declared\r\nhis belief that the usual supposed \"charge\" of the rhinoceros is\r\nnothing more nor less than a movement to draw nearer to the\r\nstrange man-object, on account of naturally poor vision, to see\r\nwhat men look like. In fact, I think that most American sportsmen\r\nwho have hunted in Africa now share that view, and credit the\r\nrhino with very rarely running at a hunter or a party in order to\r\ndo damage.\r\n\r\nThe Okapi, of Central Africa, inhabits dense jungles of arboreal\r\nvegetation and they are so expert in detecting the presence of man\r\nand in escaping from him that thus far, so far as we are aware, no\r\nwhite man has ever shot one! The native hunters take them only in\r\npitfalls or in nooses. Mr. Herbert Lang, of the American Museum of\r\nNatural History, diligently hunted the okapi, with native aid, but\r\nin spite of all his skill in woodcraft the cunning of the okapi\r\nwas so great, and the brushy woods were so great a handicap to\r\nhim, that he never shot even one specimen.\r\n\r\nIn skill in self-preservation the African bongo antelope seems to\r\nbe a strong rival of the okapi, but it has been killed by a few\r\nwhite men, of whom Captain Kermit Roosevelt is one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nMENTAL TRAITS OF A FEW RODENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nOut of the vast mass of the great order of the gnawing animals of\r\nthe world it is possible here to consider only half a dozen types.\r\nHowever, these will serve to blaze a trail into the midst of the\r\ngrand army.\r\n\r\nThe White-Footed Mouse, or Deer Mouse. On the wind-swept divides\r\nand coulees of the short-grass region of what once were the\r\nBuffalo Plains of Montana, only the boldest and most resourceful\r\nwild mice can survive. There in 1886 we found a white-footed mouse\r\nspecies (_Peromyscus leucopus_), nesting in the brain\r\ncavities of bleaching buffalo skulls, on divides as bare and\r\nsmooth as golf links.\r\n\r\nIn 1902, while hunting mule deer with Laton A. Huffman in the\r\nwildest and most picturesque bad-lands of central Montana, we\r\npitched our tent near the upper waterhole of Hell Creek.\r\n[Footnote: A few months later, acting upon the information of our\r\nfossil discoveries that we conveyed to Professor Henry Fairfield\r\nOsborn, an expedition from the American Museum of Natural History\r\nushered into the scientific world the now famous Hell Creek fossil\r\nbed, and found, about five hundred feet from the ashes of our\r\ncamp-fire, the remains of _Tyrannosaurus rex._]For the\r\nbenefit of our camp-fire, our cook proceeded to hitch his rope\r\naround a dry cottonwood log and snake it close up to our tent.\r\nWhen it was cut up, we found snugly housed in the hollow, a nest,\r\nmade chiefly of feathers, containing five white-footed mice.\r\nPacked close against the nest was a pint and a half of fine, clean\r\nseed, like radish seed, from some weed of the Pulse Family. While\r\nthe food-store was being examined, and finally deposited in a pile\r\nupon the bare ground near the tent door, the five mice escaped\r\ninto the sage-brush. Near by stood an old-fashioned buggy, which\r\nnow becomes a valuable piece of stage property.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, when Mr. Huffman lifted the cushion of his\r\nbuggy-seat, and opened the top of the shallow box underneath, the\r\nfive mice, with their heads close together in a droll-looking\r\ngroup, looked out at him in surprise and curiosity, and at first\r\nwithout attempting to run away. But very soon it became our turn\r\nto be surprised.\r\n\r\nWe found that these industrious little creatures had gathered up\r\nevery particle of their nest, and every seed of their winter\r\nstore, and carried all of it up into the seat of that buggy! The\r\nnest had been carefully re-made, and the seed placed close by, as\r\nbefore. Considering the number of journeys that must have been\r\nnecessary to carry all those materials over the ground, plus a\r\nclimb up to the buggy seat, the industry and agility of the mice\r\nwere amazing.\r\n\r\nBy way of experiment, we again removed the nest, and while the\r\nmice once more took to the sage-brush, we collected all the seed,\r\nand poured it in a pile upon the ground, as before. During the\r\nfollowing night, those indomitable little creatures _again_\r\ncarried nest and seed back into the buggy seat, just as before!\r\nThen we gathered up the entire family of mice with their nest and\r\nseed, and transported them to New York.\r\n\r\nNow, the reasoning of those wonderful little creatures, in the\r\nface of new conditions, was perfectly obvious, (1) Finding\r\nthemselves suddenly deprived of their winter home and store of\r\nfood, (2) they scattered and fled for personal safety into the\r\ntall grass and sage-brush. (3) At night they assembled for a\r\ncouncil at the ruins of their domicile and granary. (4) They\r\ndecided that they must in all haste find a new home, close by,\r\nbecause (5) at all hazards their store of food must be saved, to\r\navert starvation. (6) They explored the region around the tent and\r\ncamp-fire, and (7) finally, as a last resort, they ventured to\r\nclimb up the thills of the buggy. (8) After a full exploration of\r\nit they found that the box under the seat afforded the best winter\r\nshelter they had found. (9) At once they decided that it would do,\r\nand without a moment's delay or hesitation the whole party of five\r\nset to work carrying those seeds up the thills--a fearsome venture\r\nfor a mouse--and (10) there before daybreak they deposited the\r\nentire lot of seeds. (11) Finding that a little time remained,\r\nthey carried up the whole of their nest materials, made up the\r\nnest anew, and settled down within it for better or for worse.\r\n\r\nNow, this is no effort of our imagination. It is a story of actual\r\nfacts, all of which can be proven by three competent witnesses.\r\nHow many human beings similarly dispossessed and robbed of home\r\nand stores, act with the same cool judgment, celerity and\r\nprecision that those five tiny creatures then and there displayed?\r\n\r\nThe Wood Rat, Pack Rat, or Trading Rat. Although I have met this\r\nwonderful creature (_Neotoma_) in various places on its\r\nnative soil, I will quote from another and perfectly reliable\r\nobserver a sample narrative of its startling mental traits. At Oak\r\nLodge, east coast of Florida, we lived for a time in the home of\r\na pair of pack rats whose eccentric work was described to me by Mrs.\r\nC. F. Latham, as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst they carried a lot of watermelon seeds from the ground floor\r\nupstairs, and hid them under a pillow on a bed. Then they took\r\nfrom the kitchen a tablespoonful of cucumber seeds and hid them in\r\nthe pocket of a vest that hung upstairs on a nail. In one night\r\nthey removed from box number one, eighty five pieces of bee-hive\r\nfurniture, and hid them in another box. On the following night\r\nthey deposited in box number one about two quarts of corn and\r\noats.\r\n\r\nWestern frontiersmen and others who live in the land of the pack\r\nrat relate stories innumerable of the absurd but industrious\r\ndoings of these eccentric creatures. The ways of the pack rat are\r\nso erratic that I find it impossible to figure out by any rules\r\nknown to me the workings of their minds. Strange to say, they are\r\nnot fiends and devils of malice and destruction like the brown rat\r\nof civilization, and on the whole it seems that the destruction of\r\nvaluable property is not by any means a part of their plan. They\r\nhave a passion for moving things. Their vagaries seem to be due\r\nchiefly to caprice, and an overwhelming desire to keep exceedingly\r\nbusy. I think that the animal psychologists have lost much by so\r\ncompletely ignoring these brain-busy animals, and I hope that in\r\nthe future they will receive the attention they deserve. Why\r\nexperiment with stupid and nerveless white rats when pack rats are\r\nso cheap?\r\n\r\nIt was in the wonderland that on the map is labeled \"Arizona\"\r\nthat I met some astonishing evidences of the defensive reasoning\r\npower of the pack rat. In the Sonoran Desert, where for arid\r\nreasons the clumps of creosote bushes and salt bushes stand from\r\nfour to six feet apart, the bare level ground between clumps\r\naffords smooth and easy hunting-grounds for coyotes, foxes and\r\nbadgers, saying nothing of the hawks and owls.\r\n\r\nNow, a burrow in sandy ground is often a poor fortress; and the\r\ndropping spine-clad joints of the tree choyas long ago suggested\r\nbetter defenses. In many places we saw the entrance of pack rat\r\nburrows defended by two bushels of spiny choya joints and sticks\r\narranged in a compact mound-like mass. In view of the virtue in\r\nthose deadly spines, any predatory mammal or bird would hesitate\r\nlong before tackling a bushel of solid joints to dig through it to\r\nthe mouth of a burrow.\r\n\r\nDid those little animals collect and place those joints because of\r\ntheir defensive stickers,--with deliberate forethought and\r\nintention? Let us see.\r\n\r\nIn the grounds of the Desert Botanical Laboratory, in November\r\n1907, we found the answer to this question, so plainly spread\r\nbefore us that even the dullest man can not ignore it, nor the\r\nmost skeptical dispute it. We found some pack rat runways and\r\nburrow entrances so elaborately laid out and so well defended by\r\nchoya joints that we may well call the ensemble a fortress. On\r\nthe spot I made a very good map of it, which is presented on page\r\n164. [Footnote: From \"Camp-Fires on Desert and Lava\" (Scribner's)\r\npage 304.] The animal that made it was the White-Throated Pack Rat\r\n(_Neotoma albigula_). The fortress consisted of several\r\nburrow entrances, the roads leading to which were defended by\r\ncarefully constructed barriers of cactus joints full of spines.\r\n\r\nThe habitants had chosen to locate their fortress between a large\r\ncreosote bush and a tree-choya cactus (_Opuntia fulgida_)\r\nthat grew on bare ground, twelve feet apart. When away from home\r\nand in danger, the pack rats evidently fled for safety to one or\r\nthe other of those outposts. Between them the four entrance holes,\r\nthen in use, went down into the earth; and there were also four\r\nabandoned holes.\r\n\r\nConnecting the two outposts,--the creosote bush and the choya,--\r\nwith the holes that were in daily use there were some\r\nmuch-used runways, as shown on the map; and each side of each\r\nrunway was barricaded throughout its length with spiny joints of\r\nthe choya. A few of the joints were old and dry, but the majority\r\nwere fresh and in full vigor. We estimated that about three\r\nhundred cactus joints were in use guarding those runways; and no\r\ncoyote or fox of my acquaintance, nor eke a dog of any sense,\r\nwould rashly jump upon that spiny pavement to capture a rat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration with caption: FORTRESS OF A PACK-RAT, AT TUCSON\r\nDEFENDED BY THE SPINY POINTS OF THE TREE CHOYA (_Opuntia\r\nfulgida_)]\r\n\r\nBeyond the cactus outpost the main run led straight to the\r\nsheltering base of a thick mesquite bush and a palo verde that\r\ngrew tightly together. This gave an additional ten feet of safe\r\nground, or about twenty-five feet in all.\r\n\r\nOn our journey to the Pinacate Mountains, northwestern Mexico, we\r\nsaw about twelve cactus-defended burrows of the pack rat, some of\r\nthem carefully located in the midst of large stones that rendered\r\ndigging by predatory animals almost impossible.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful little Desert Kangaroo Rat (_Dipodomys\r\ndeserti_) has worked out quite a different system of home\r\nprotection. It inhabits deserts of loose sand and creosote bushes,\r\nwhere it digs burrows innumerable, always located amid the roots\r\nof the bushes, and each one provided with three or four\r\nentrances,--or exits, as the occasion may require. Each burrow is\r\na bewildering labyrinth of galleries and tunnels, and in\r\nattempting to lay bare an interior the loose sand caved in, and\r\nthe little sprite that lived there either escaped at a distant\r\npoint or was lost in the shuffle of sand.\r\n\r\nThe Gray Squirrel (_Sciurus carolinensis_).--This beautiful\r\nand sprightly animal quickly recognizes man's protection and\r\nfriendship, and meets him half way. Go into the woods, sit still,\r\nmake a noise like a nut, and if any grays are there very soon you\r\nwill see them. The friendships between our Park visitors and the\r\nPark's wild squirrels are one of the interesting features of our\r\ndaily life. We have an excellent picture of Mrs. Russell Sage\r\nsitting on a park bench with a wild gray squirrel in her lap. I\r\nhave never seen red or fox squirrels that even approached the\r\nconfidence of the gray squirrel in the truce with Man, the\r\nDestroyer, but no doubt generous treatment would produce in the\r\nformer the gray squirrel's degree of confidence.\r\n\r\nI never knew an observer of the home life of the gray squirrel who\r\nwas not profoundly impressed by the habit of that animal in\r\nburying nuts in the autumn, and digging them up for food in the\r\nwinter and spring. From my office window I have seen our silver-\r\ngray friends come hopping through eight or ten inches of snow,\r\ncarefully select a spot, then quickly bore a hole down through the\r\nsnow to Mother Earth, and emerge with a nut. Thousands of people\r\nhave seen this remarkable performance and I think that the\r\nmajority of them still ask the question: \"_How_ does the\r\nsquirrel know precisely where to dig?\" That question cannot be\r\nanswered until we have learned how to read the squirrel mind.\r\n\r\nSmall city parks easily become overstocked with gray squirrels\r\nthat are not adequately fed, and the result is,--complaints of\r\n\"depredations.\" Of course hungry and half-starved squirrels will\r\ndepredate,--on birds' nests, fruit and gardens. My answer to all\r\ninquirers for advice in such cases is--_feed the squirrels,\r\nadequately, and constantly, on cracked corn and nuts, and send\r\naway the surplus squirrels._\r\n\r\nAt this time many persons know that the wild animals and birds now\r\nliving upon the earth are here solely because they have had\r\nsufficient sense to devise ways and means by which to survive. The\r\nignorant, the incompetent, the slothful and the unlucky ones have\r\npassed from earth and joined the grand army of fossils.\r\n\r\nTake the case of the Rocky Mountain Pika, or little chief \"hare,\"\r\nof British Columbia and elsewhere. It is not a hare at all, and it\r\nis so queer that it occupies a family all alone. I am now\r\nconcerning myself with _Ochotona princeps,_ of the Canadian\r\nRockies. It is very small and weak, but by its wits it lives in a\r\ncountry reeking with hungry bears, wolverines and martens. The\r\npika is so small and so weak that in the open he could not\r\npossibly dig down below the grizzly bear's ability to dig.\r\n\r\nAnd what does he do to save himself, and insure the survival of\r\nthe fittest?\r\n\r\nHe burrows far down in the slide-rock that falls from the cliffs,\r\nwhere he is protected by a great bed of broken stone so thick that\r\nno predatory animal can dig through it and catch him. There in\r\nthose awful solitudes, enlivened only by the crack and rattle of\r\nfalling slide-rock, the harsh cry of Clark's nut-cracker and the\r\nwhistling wind sweeping over the storm-threshed summits and\r\nthrough the stunted cedar, the pika chooses to  make his\r\nhome. Over the slide-rock that protects him, the snows of the long\r\nand dreary winter pile up from six to ten feet deep, and lie\r\nunbroken for months. And how does the pika survive?\r\n\r\n[Illustration\r\nwith caption: WILD CHIPMUNKS RESPOND TO MAN'S PROTECTION. J. Alden\r\nLoring and his wild pets]\r\n\r\n[Illustration with caption: AN OPOSSUM FEIGNING DEATH]\r\n\r\nWhen he is awake, _he lives on hay, of his own making!_\r\n\r\nIn September and October, and up to the arrival of the enveloping\r\nsnow, he cuts plants of certain kinds to his liking, he places\r\nthem in little piles atop of rocks or fallen logs where the sun\r\nwill strike them, and he leaves them there until they dry\r\nsufficiently to be stored without mildewing. Mr. Charles L. Smith\r\ndeclared that the pikas know enough to change their little hay\r\npiles as the day wears on, from shade to sunlight. The plants to\r\nbe made into hay are cut at the edge of the slide-rock, usually\r\nabout a foot in length, and are carried in and placed on flat-\r\ntopped rocks around the mouth of the burrow. The stems are laid\r\ntogether with fair evenness, and from start to finish the\r\nhaymaking of the pika is conducted with admirable system and\r\nprecision. When we saw and examined half a dozen of those curing\r\nhay piles, we felt inclined to take off our hats to the thinking\r\nmind of that small animal which was making a perfectly successful\r\nstruggle to hold its own against the winter rigors of the summits,\r\nand at the same time escape from its enemies.\r\n\r\nThe common, every-day Cotton-Tail Rabbit (_Lepus sylvaticus_)\r\nis not credited by anyone with being as wise as a fox, but that\r\nis due to our own careless habits of thought. It has been man's way,\r\never since the days of the Cavemen, to underrate all wild animals\r\nexcept himself. We are not going to cite a long line of individual\r\ninstances to exhibit the mental processes or the natural wisdom of\r\nthe rabbit. All we need do is to point to its success in\r\nmaintaining its existence in spite of the enemies arrayed against\r\nit.\r\n\r\nTake the state of Pennsylvania, and consider this list of the\r\nrabbit's mortal enemies:\r\n\r\n450,000 well-armed men and boys, regularly licensed and diligently\r\ngunning throughout six weeks of the year, and actually killing\r\neach year about 3,500,000 rabbits!\r\n\r\n200,000 farmers hunting on their own farms, without licenses.\r\n\r\nPredatory animals, such as dogs, cats, skunks, foxes and weasels.\r\n\r\nPredatory birds: hawks, eagles and owls.\r\n\r\nDestructive elements: forest fires, rain, snow and sleet.\r\n\r\nNow, is it not a wonder that _any_ rabbits remain alive in\r\nPennsylvania? But they are there. They refuse to be exterminated.\r\nHalf of them annually outwit all their enemies--smart as they\r\nare; they avoid death by hunger and cold, and they go on breeding\r\nin defiance of wild men, beasts and birds. Is it not wonderful--\r\nthe mentality of the gray rabbit? Again we say--the wild animal\r\nmust think or die.\r\n\r\nIn recognizing man's protection and friendship, the rabbit is as\r\nquick on the draw as the gray squirrel. In our Zoological Park\r\nwhere we constantly kill hunting cats in order that our little\r\nwild neighbors, the rabbits, squirrels and chipmunks may live, the\r\nrabbits live literally in our midst. They hang around the\r\nAdministration Building, rear and front, as if they owned it; and\r\none evening at sunset I came near stepping out upon a pair that\r\nwere roosting on the official door-mat on the porch. There are\r\ntimes when they seem annoyed by the passage of automobiles over\r\nthe service road.\r\n\r\nTo keep hungry rabbits from barking your young apple trees in\r\nmidwinter, spend a dollar or two in buying two or three bushels of\r\ncorn expressly for them.\r\n\r\nThe sentry system of the Prairie-\"Dog\" in guarding \"towns\" is very\r\nnearly perfect. A warning chatter quickly sends every \"dog\"\r\nscurrying to the mouth of its hole, ready for the dive to safety\r\nfar below. No! the prairie-\"dog,\" rattlesnake and burrowing owl\r\nemphatically do NOT dwell together in peace and harmony in the\r\nburrow of the \"dog.\" The rodent hates both these interloping\r\nenemies, and carefully avoids them. The pocket gopher does his\r\nmigrating and prospecting at night, when his enemies are asleep.\r\nThe gray squirrel builds for itself a summer nest of leaves. At\r\nthe real beginning of winter the prairie-\"dog\" tightly plugs up\r\nwith moist earth the mouth of his burrow; and he packs it with his\r\nnose. The round-tailed muskrat of Florida (_Neofiber alleni_)\r\nbuilds a little platform over the water of the marsh in which it\r\nlives, on which it builds its nest high and dry. The Hudsonian red\r\nsquirrel will bark and scold at a human intruder for half an hour.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter IV I have already accorded the beaver a place with the\r\nmost intelligent animals of the world. The books that have been\r\nwritten concerning that species have been amply justified. It is,\r\nhowever, impossible to refuse this important animal a place in any\r\nchapter devoted to the mental traits of rodents, and I deem it\r\nfitting to record here our latest experience with this remarkable\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nOur Last Beaver Experiment. In the autumn of 1921 we emptied and\r\ncleaned out our Beaver Pond. The old house originally built by the\r\nbeavers in the centre of the pond, was for sanitary reasons\r\nentirely removed. Work on the pond was not finished until about\r\nOctober 25; and the beavers had no house.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me a physical impossibility for the beavers to begin\r\na new house at that late date and unassisted finish it by the\r\nbeginning of winter. One beaver had escaped, and for the remaining\r\nthree such a task would be beyond their powers. I decided to give\r\nthem a helping hand, provided they would accept it, by providing\r\nthem with a wooden house, which they might if they chose, entirely\r\nsurround and snugly cover with mud and sticks.\r\n\r\nBut would they accept it in a grateful spirit, and utilize it? One\r\ncannot always tell what a wild animal will do.\r\n\r\nWith loose earth a low island with a flat top was built to carry\r\nthe house. Its top was six inches above high-water mark, and (that\r\nwould, if accepted) be the floor of the permanent house. A good,\r\npracticable tunnel was built to an underwater entrance.\r\n\r\nUpon that our men set a square, bottomless house of wood, with\r\nwalls two feet high, and a low roof sloping four ways. Over all\r\nthis the men piled in a neat mound a lot of tree branches of kinds\r\nsuitable for beaver food; and with that we left the situation up\r\nto the beavers. The finish of our work was made on October 28.\r\n\r\nFor a week there were no developments. The beavers made no sign of\r\napproval or disapproval. And then things began to happen. On\r\nNovember 5 we saw a beaver carrying a small green branch into the\r\nhouse for _bedding!_ That meant that our offering was going\r\nto be accepted.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent chronology of that beaver house is as follows:\r\n\r\nNov. 10. The beavers pulled all our brush away from the house,\r\nback to a distance of six or seven feet. The house stood fully\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\nNov. 11. They began to pile up mud and sticks against the base of\r\nthe south wall.\r\n\r\nNov. 15. Mud-building to cover the house was in full progress.\r\n\r\nNov. 17. Much of our brush had been placed in the stock of food\r\nwood being stored for winter use in the pond west of the house.\r\n\r\nNov. 29. The outside of the house was completely covered up to the\r\nedges of the roof. The beavers were working fast and hard. No\r\nfreezing weather yet.\r\n\r\nDec. 15. The roof was not yet covered. Ice had formed on the pond,\r\nand house-building operations were at an end until the spring of\r\n1922.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nTHE MENTAL TRAITS OF BIRDS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn comparison with mammalian mentality, the avian mind is much\r\nmore elementary and primitive. It is as far behind the average of\r\nthe mammals as the minds of fishes are inferior to those of\r\nreptiles.\r\n\r\nInstinct Prominent in Birds. The average bird is more a creature\r\nof instinct than of reason. Primarily it lives and moves by and\r\nthrough the knowledge that it has inherited, rather than by the\r\nobservations it has made and the things it has thought out in its\r\nown head.\r\n\r\nBut let it not for one moment be supposed that the instinctive\r\nknowledge of the bird is of a mental quality inferior to that of\r\nthe mammal. The difference is in kind only, not in degree. As a\r\nfactor in self-preservation the keen and correct reasoning of the\r\nfarm-land fox is in no sense superior to the wonderful instinct\r\nand prescience of the golden plover that, on a certain calendar\r\nday, or week, bids farewell to its comfortable breeding-grounds in\r\nthe cold north beyond the arctic circle, rises high in the air and\r\nlaunches forth on its long and perilous migration flight of 8,000\r\nmiles to its winter resort in Argentina.\r\n\r\nThe Migrations of Birds. Volumes have been written on the\r\nmigrations of birds. The subject is vast, and inexhaustable. It\r\nis perhaps the most wonderful of all the manifestations of avian\r\nintelligence. It is of interest chiefly to the birds of the\r\ntemperate zone, whose summer homes and food supplies are for four\r\nmonths of the year buried under a mantle of snow and ice. All but\r\na corporal's guard of the birds of the United States and Canada\r\nmust go south every winter or perish from starvation and cold. It\r\nis a case of migrate or die. Many of the birds do not mind the\r\ncold of the northern winter--if it is dry; and _if they could be\r\nfed in winter,_ many of them would remain with us throughout\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\nConsider the migratory habits of our own home favorites,\r\nand see what they reveal. After all else has been said, bird\r\nmigration is the one unfathomable wonder of the avian world.\r\nReally, we know of it but little more than we know of the songs of\r\nthe morning stars. We have learned when the birds start; we know\r\nthat many of them fly far above the earth; we know where some of\r\nthem land, and the bird calendars show approximately when they\r\nwill return. And is not that really about _all_ that we do\r\nknow?\r\n\r\n[Illustration with caption: MIGRATION OF THE GOLDEN PLOVER From\r\n\"Bird Migration,\", by Dr. W. W. Cooke, U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture, 1915.]\r\n\r\nWhat courage it must take, to start on the long, tiresome and\r\ndangerous journey! How do they know where to go, far into the\r\nheart of the South, to find rest, food and security? When and\r\nwhere do they stop on the way to feed? Vast areas are passed over\r\nwithout alighting; for many species never are seen in mid career.\r\nWhy is it that the golden plover feels that it is worth while to\r\nfly from the arctic coast to Argentina?\r\n\r\nLet any man--if one there be--who is not profoundly impressed by\r\nthe combined instinct and the reasoning of migratory birds do\r\nhimself the favor to procure and study the 47-page pamphlet by Dr.\r\nWells W. Cooke, of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, entitled\r\n\"Bird Migration.\" I wish I could reproduce it entire; but since\r\nthat is impossible, here are a few facts and figures from it.\r\n\r\nThe Bobolink summers in the northern United States and southern\r\nCanada, and winters in Paraguay, making 5000 miles of travel each\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe Scarlet Tanager summers in the northeastern quarter of the\r\nUnited States and winters in Colombia, Equador and northern Peru,\r\na limit to limit flight of 3,880 miles.\r\n\r\nThe Golden Plover (_Charadrius dominicus_).--\"In fall it\r\nflies over the ocean from Nova Scotia to South America, 2,400\r\nmiles--the longest known flight of any bird. In spring it returns\r\nby way of the Mississippi Valley. Thus the migration routes form\r\nan enormous ellipse, with a minor axis of 2,000 miles and a major\r\naxis stretching 8,000 miles from arctic America to Argentina.\"\r\n(Cooke.) The Arctic Tern (_Sterna paradisaea_), is \"the\r\nchampion long-distance migrant of the world. It breeds as far\r\nnorth as it can find land on which to build its nest, and winters\r\nas far south as there is open water to furnish it food. The\r\nextreme summer and winter homes are 11,000 miles apart, or a\r\nyearly round trip of 22,000 miles.\" (Cooke.)\r\n\r\nBy what do migrating birds guide their courses high in air on a\r\npitch-dark night,--their busy time for flying? Do they, too, know\r\nabout the mariner's Southern Cross, and steer by it on starlit\r\nnights? Equally strange things have happened.\r\n\r\nThe regular semi-annual migrations of birds may fairly be regarded\r\nas the high-water mark of instinct so profound and far-reaching\r\nthat it deserves to rank as high as reason. To me it is one of the\r\nmost marvelous things in Nature's Book of Wonders. I never see a\r\nhumming-bird poised over a floral tube of a trumpet creeper\r\nwithout pausing, in wonder that is perpetual, and asking the\r\neternal question: \"Frail and delicate feathered sprite, that any\r\nstorm-gust might dash to earth and destroy, and that any enemy\r\nmight crush, _how_ do you make your long and perilous\r\njourneys unstarved and unkilled? Is it because you bear a charmed\r\nlife? What is the unsolved mystery of your tiny existence in this\r\nrough and cruel world?\"\r\n\r\nWe understand well enough the foundation principles of mammalian\r\nand avian life, and existence under adverse circumstances. The\r\nmammal is tied to his environment. He cannot go far from the\r\ncircumpolar regions of his home. A bear chained to a stake is\r\nemblematic of the universal handicap on mammalian life. Survive or\r\nperish, the average land-going quadruped must stay put, and make\r\nthe best of the home in which he is born. If he attempts to\r\nmigrate fast and far, he is reasonably certain to get into grave\r\ndanger, and lose his life.\r\n\r\nThe bird, however, is a free moral agent. If the purple grackle\r\ndoes not like the sunflower seeds in my garden, lo! he is up and\r\naway across the Sound to Oyster Bay, Long Island, where his luck\r\nmay be better. Failing there, he gives himself a transfer to\r\nWilmington, or Richmond, via his own Atlantic coast line.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful migratory instincts of birds have been developed\r\nand intensified through countless generations by the imperative\r\nneed for instinctive guidance, and the comparatively small\r\ntemptation to inductive reasoning based on known facts. Evidently\r\nthe bird is emboldened to migrate by the comfortable belief that\r\nsomewhere the world contains food and warmth to its liking, and\r\nthat if it flies fast enough and far enough it will find it.\r\n\r\nAs a weather prophet, the prescience of the bird is strictly\r\nlimited. The warm spells of late February deceive the birds just\r\nas they do the flowers of the peach tree and the apple. Often the\r\nbluebirds and robins migrate northward too early, encounter\r\nblizzards, and perish in large numbers from snow, sleet, cold and\r\nhunger.\r\n\r\nThe Homing Sense of Birds. We can go no farther than to say that\r\nwhile the homing instinct of certain species of birds is quite\r\nwell known, the mental process by which it functions is\r\npractically unknown. The direction instinct of the homing pigeon\r\nis marvelous, but we know that that instinct does not leap full-\r\nfledged from the nest. The homer needs assistance and training.\r\nWhen it is about three months old, it is taken in a basket to a\r\npoint a mile distant from its home and liberated. If it makes good\r\nin returning to the home loft, the distances are increased by easy\r\nstages--two, three, five, ten, twenty, thirty, fifty and seventy-\r\nfive miles usually being flown before the bird is sent as far as\r\n100 miles. The official long-distance record for a homing pigeon\r\nis 1689.44 miles, held by an American bird.\r\n\r\nThe homing instinct, or sense, is present in some mammals, but it\r\nis by no means so phenomenal as in some species of birds. In\r\nmammals it is individual rather than species-wide. Individual\r\nhorses, dogs and cats have done wonderful things under the\r\npropulsion of the homing instinct, but that instinct is by no\r\nmeans general throughout those species. Among wild animals,\r\nexhibitions of the home-finding instinct are rare, but the annals\r\nof the Zoological Park contain one amusing record.\r\n\r\nFor emergency reasons, a dozen fallow deer once were quartered in\r\nour Bison range, behind a fence only sixty-six inches high.\r\nPresently they leaped out to freedom, disappeared in the thick\r\nnorthern forests of the Bronx, and we charged them up to profit\r\nand loss. But those deer soon found that life outside our domain\r\nwas not the dream of paradise that they had supposed. After about\r\na week of wandering through a cold, unsympathetic and oatless\r\nworld those were sadder and wiser deer, and one night they all\r\nreturned and joyously and thankfully jumped back into their range,\r\nwhere they were happy ever after.\r\n\r\nRecognition of Sanctuary Protection. In this field of precise\r\nobservation and reasoning, most birds,--if not indeed all of\r\nthem,--are quick in discernment and accurate in deduction. The\r\ngreat gauntlet of guns has taught the birds of the United States\r\nand Canada to recognize the difference between areas of shooting\r\nand no shooting. Dull indeed is the bird mind that does not know\r\nenough to return to the feeding-ground in which it has been safe\r\nfrom attack. The wild geese and ducks are very keen about\r\nsanctuary waters, and no protected pond or river is too small to\r\ncommand attention. Our own little Lake Agassiz, in the New York\r\nZoological Park, each year is the resort of hundreds of mallards\r\nand black ducks. And each year a number of absolutely wild wood\r\nducks breed there and in spite of all dangers rear their young.\r\nOur wild-fowl pond, surrounded by various installations for birds,\r\nseveral times has been honored by visiting delegations of wild\r\ngeese, seven of which were caught in 1902 for exhibition.\r\n\r\nThe most astounding example of avian recognition of protection\r\nand human friendship is the spectacle of Mr. Jack Miner's wild\r\ngoose sanctuary at Kingsville, Ontario, not far from Detroit. With\r\nhis tile works on one side and his home on the other, he scooped\r\nout between them clay for his factory and made a small pond. With\r\ndeliberate and praiseworthy intention Mr. Miner planted there a\r\nlittle flock of pinioned wild Canada geese, as a notice of\r\nsanctuary and an invitation to wild flocks to come down for food,\r\nrest and good society.\r\n\r\nVery slowly at first the wild geese began to come; but finally the\r\nword was passed along the line from Hudson Bay to Currituck Sound\r\nthat Miner's roadhouse was a good place at which to stop. Year by\r\nyear the wild geese came, and saw, and were conquered. So many\r\nthousands came that presently Mr. Miner grew tired of spending out\r\nof his own pocket more than $700 a year for goose corn; and then\r\nthe Canadian government most commendably assumed the burden, and\r\nmade Mr. Miner's farm a national bird preserve. [Footnote: Mr.\r\nMiner is writing his wild-goose story into a book: and the story\r\nis worth it!]\r\n\r\nThe annals of wild life protection literature contain many records\r\nand illustrations of the remarkable quickness and thoroughness of\r\nsanctuary recognition by birds. On the other hand I feel greatly\r\nannoyed by the failure of waterfowl to reason equally well\r\nregarding the decoys of duck-shooters. They fail to learn, either\r\nby experience or hearsay, that small flocks of ducks sitting\r\nmotionless near a shore are loaded, and liable to go off. They\r\nfail to learn that it is most wise to settle well outside such\r\nflocks of alleged ducks, and that it is a fatal mistake to plump\r\ndown on the top of a motionless bunch.\r\n\r\nProtective Association of Wasps and Caciques. The colonizing\r\ncaciques, of South America, representing four genera, are very\r\nsolicitous of the safety of their colonies. In numerous cases,\r\nthese colonies are found in association with wasps, one or more\r\nnests invariably being found near the nests of the birds. It is\r\nnatural to infer that this strange association is due to the\r\ninitiative of the birds. When monkeys attack the birds, the birds\r\nneed the stinging insects.\r\n\r\nAs usual in the study of wild creatures, the first thing that we\r\nencounter in the wild bird is\r\n\r\nTemperament. On this hangs the success or failure of a species in\r\nassociation with man. Temperament in the most intellectual wild\r\ncreatures is just as evident and negotiable to the human eye as\r\ncolors are in fur or feathers.\r\n\r\nA vastly preponderating number of bird species are of sanguine\r\ntemperament; and it is this fact alone that renders it possible\r\nfor us to exhibit continuously from 700 to 800 species of birds.\r\nSensible behavior in captivity is the one conspicuous trait of\r\ncharacter in which birds mentally and physically are far better\r\nbalanced than mammals. But few birds are foolishly nervous or\r\nhysterical, and when once settled down the great majority of them\r\nare sanguine and philosophical. Birds of a great many species can\r\nbe caught in an adult state and settled down in captivity without\r\ndifficulty; whereas all save a few species of mammals, when\r\ncaptured as adults, are irreconcilable fighters and many of them\r\ndie far too quickly. In a well-regulated zoological park nearly\r\nevery animal that has been caught when adult is a failure and a\r\nnuisance.\r\n\r\nTo name the species of birds that can be caught fully grown and\r\nsettled down for exhibition purposes, would create a list of\r\nformidable length. It is indeed fortunate for us that this is\r\ntrue; for the rearing of nestlings is a tedious task.\r\n\r\nA conspicuous exception to the rule of philosophic sedateness in\r\nnewly caught birds is the loon, or great northern diver. That bird\r\nis so exceedingly nervous and foolish, and so persistent in its\r\nevil ways, that never once have we succeeded in inducing a loon to\r\nsettle down on exhibition and be good. When caught and placed in\r\nour kind of captivity, the loon goes daft. It dives and dives, and\r\nswims under water until it is completely exhausted; it loses its\r\nappetite, and very soon dies. Of course if one had a whole marine\r\nbiological station to place at the disposal of the foolish loon,\r\nit might get on.\r\n\r\nThere are other odd exceptions to the rule of normal bird conduct.\r\nSome of our upland game birds, particularly the Franklin grouse\r\nand ptarmigan of the Rocky Mountains, display real mental\r\ndeficiencies in the very necessary business of self-preservation.\r\n\r\nWILDNESS AND TAMENESS OF THE RUFFED GROUSE. The ruffed grouse is\r\none of the most difficult of all North American game birds to keep\r\nin captivity. This fact is due largely, though not entirely, to\r\nthe nervous and often hysterical temperament of this species. Some\r\nbirds will within a reasonable time quiet down and accept\r\ncaptivity, but others throughout long periods,--or forever,--\r\nremain wild as hawks, and perpetually try to dash themselves to\r\npieces against the wire of their enclosures. Prof. A. A. Allen of\r\nCornell once kept a bird for an entire year, only to find it at\r\nthe end of that time hopelessly wild; so he gave the bird its\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nHowever, in this species there are numerous exceptions. Some wing-\r\ntipped birds have calmed down and accepted captivity gracefully\r\nand sensibly, and a few of the cases of this kind have been\r\nremarkable. The most astonishing cases, however, have been of the\r\ntameness of free wild birds, in the Catskills, and also near the\r\ncity of Schenectady. A great many perfectly truthful stories have\r\nbeen published of wild birds that actually sought close\r\nacquaintance with people, and took food from their hands.\r\n\r\nWe have been asked to account for those strange manifestations,\r\nbut it is impossible to do so. It seems that in some manner,\r\ncertain grouse individuals learned that Man is not always a killer\r\nand a dangerous animal, and so those birds accepted him as a\r\nfriend,--until the killers came along and violated the sanctuary\r\nstatus.\r\n\r\nIt is both necessary, and highly desirable for the increase of\r\nspecies, that all wild birds should fly promptly, rapidly and far\r\nfrom the presence of Man, the Arch Enemy of Wild Life. The species\r\nthat persistently neglects to do so, or is unable, soon is utterly\r\ndestroyed. The great auk species was massacred and extirpated on\r\nFunk Island because it could not get away from its sordid enemies\r\nwho destroyed it for a paltry supply of _oil_.\r\n\r\nThe Fool Hen and Its Folly. In our own country there exists a\r\ngrouse species so foolish in its mind, and so destitute of the\r\nmost ordinary instinct of self-preservation that it has been known\r\nfor many years as \"the Fool Hen.\" Definitely, it is the Franklin\r\nGrouse (_Conachites franklini_), and its home is in the\r\nfoothills of the Rocky Mountains. This famous and pitiable victim\r\nof misplaced confidence will sit only eight feet up on a jack pine\r\nlimb, beside a well travelled road, while Mack Norboe dismounts,\r\nfinds a suitable stick, and knocks the foolish bird dead from its\r\nperch. I have seen these birds sit still and patiently wait for\r\ntheir heads to be shot off, one by one, with a .22 calibre\r\nrevolver when all points of the compass were open for their\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nAll this, however, must be set down as an unusual and phenomenal\r\nabsence of the most natural instinct of self-protection. The\r\npinnated grouse, sage grouse, Bob White quail and ptarmigan\r\nexercise but little keen reason in self-protection. They are easy\r\nmarks,--the joy of the pot-hunter and the delight of the duffer\r\n\"sportsman.\"\r\n\r\nDullness of Instinct in Grouse and Quail. The pinnated grouse,\r\nwhich in Iowa and the Dakotas positively is a migratory bird, does\r\nknow enough to fly high when it is migrating, but seemingly this\r\nspecies and the sage grouse never will grow wise enough to save\r\nthemselves from hunters when on their feeding grounds. In\r\ndetecting the presence of their arch enemy they are hopelessly\r\ndull; and they are slow in taking wing.\r\n\r\nThe quail is a very good hider, but a mighty poor flyer. When a\r\ncovey is flushed by a collection of dogs and armed men, the\r\nlightning-quick and explosive get-away is all right; but the\r\nunshot birds do not fly half far enough! Instead of bowling away\r\nfor two or three miles and getting clear out of the danger zone\r\nand hiding in the nearest timber, what do they do? They foolishly\r\nstop on the other side of the field, or in the next acre of brush,\r\nin full view of the hunters and dogs, who find it great fun to\r\nhustle after them and in fifteen minutes put them up again. Thus\r\nit is easy for a hunting party to \"follow up\" a covey until the\r\nlast bird of it has been bagged.\r\n\r\nJust before the five-year close season on quail went into effect\r\nin Iowa, this incident occurred:\r\n\r\nOn a farm of four hundred acres in the southern part of the state,\r\ntwo gunners killed so nearly up to their bag limit of _fifty\r\nbirds per day_ that in ten days they went away with 400 quail.\r\nThe foolish birds obstinately refused to leave the farm which had\r\nbeen their home and shelter. Day after day the chase with dogs and\r\nmen, and the fusillade of shots, went briskly on. As a matter of\r\nfact, that outfit easily could have gone on until every quail on\r\nthat farm had fallen.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed strange that the very bird which practices such fine\r\nand successful strategy in leading an intruder away from its\r\nhelpless young, by playing wounded, should fail so seriously when\r\nbefore the guns. A hunted quail covey should learn to post a\r\nsentry to watch for danger and give the alarm in time for a safe\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nBut I know one quail species that is a glorious exception. It is\r\nGambel's quail, of southern Arizona. I saw a good wing shot, Mr.\r\nJohn M. Phillips, hunt that quail (without dogs) until he was hot\r\nand red, and come in with more wrath than birds. He said, with an\r\ninjured air:\r\n\r\n\"The little beggars won't rise! I don't want to shoot them on the\r\nground, and the minute they rise above the creosote bushes they\r\ndrop right down into them again, and go on running.\"\r\n\r\nIt was even so. They simply will not rise and fly away, as Bob\r\nWhite does, giving the sportsmen a chance to kill them, but when\r\nforced to fly up clear of the bushes they at once drop back again.\r\n[Footnote: A very few quail-killers of the East who oppose long\r\nclose seasons contend that quail coveys \"breed better\" when they\r\nare shot to pieces every year and \"scattered,\" but we observed\r\nthat the quail of the Sonoran Desert managed to survive and breed\r\nand perpetuate themselves numerously without the benevolent\r\ncooperation of the \"pump-gun\" and the automatic shotgun.] While\r\nthe study of avian mentality is a difficult undertaking, this is\r\nno excuse for the fact that up to this date (1922) that field of\r\nendeavor has been only scratched on its surface. The birds of the\r\nworld are by no means so destitute of ideas and inventions that\r\nthey merit almost universal neglect. Because of the suggestions\r\nthey contain we will point out a few prominent mental traits in\r\nbirds, chosen at random.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, let us all beware of seeing too much, and chary\r\nof recording scientific hallucinations. It is better to see\r\nnothing than to see many things that are not true! In ten octavo\r\npages that particular rock can split wide open the best reputation\r\never grown.\r\n\r\nBird Architecture. The wisdom of birds in the selection of nesting\r\nsites, the designing of the best nest for their respective wants,\r\nand finally the construction of them, indicate instinct, reasoning\r\npower and mechanical skill of a high order. The range from the\r\nwonderful woven homes of the weaver bird and the Baltimore oriole\r\ndown to the bare and nestless incubating spot of the penguin is so\r\ngreat that nothing less than a volume can furnish space in which\r\nto set it forth. But let us at least take a brief glance at a wide\r\nrange of home-building activities by birds.\r\n\r\nThe orioles, caciques and weavers weave wonderful homes of fibrous\r\nmaterial, often in populous communities.\r\n\r\nThe bower birds erect remarkable bowers, as playhouses.\r\n\r\nThe brush turkey scratches together a huge mound of sticks and\r\nleaves, four feet by ten or twelve wide at the base.\r\n\r\nThe vireo and many others turn out beautiful cup-like nests.\r\n\r\nThe hummingbird builds with the solidity and tenacity of the wasp.\r\n\r\nThe swallow is a wonderful modeler with mud.\r\n\r\nThe guacharo builds a solid nest like a cheese with a concave top.\r\n\r\nThe auklet, the puffin and the kingfishers burrow into the\r\nfriendly and solid earth. The eider duck plucks from its own breast\r\nthe softest, of feather linings for its nest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration with caption: REMARKABLE\r\nVILLAGE NESTS OF THE SOCIABLE WEAVER BIRD (Copied from \"The Fauna\r\nof South Africa Birds,\" by Arthur C. Stark)]\r\n\r\nThe grebe thoughtfully keeps its nest above high-water mark by\r\nbuilding on a floating island.\r\n\r\nThe murre and the guillemot do their best to escape their enemies\r\nof the land by building high upon inaccessible rock ledges.\r\n\r\nThe woodpecker trusts no living species save his own, and drills\r\nhigh up into a hollow tree-trunk for his home.\r\n\r\nThe cactus wren and crissal thrasher build in the geographical\r\ncentres of tree choyas, so protected by 500,000 spines that no\r\nhawk or owl can reach them.\r\n\r\nThis catalogue could be extended to a great length; but why pile\r\nevidence upon evidence!\r\n\r\nIt cannot be correct to assume that the nesting activities of\r\nbirds are based upon instinct alone. That theory would be\r\nuntenable. New conditions call for independent thought, and\r\noriginality of treatment. If the ancestral plans and\r\nspecifications could not be varied, then every bird would have to\r\nbuild a nest just \"such as mother used to make,\" or have no brood.\r\n\r\nAll bird students know full well how easily the robin, the wren,\r\nthe hawk and the owl change locations and materials to meet new\r\nand strange conditions. A robin has been known to build on the\r\nrunning-board of a switch-engine in a freight yard, and another\r\nrobin built on the frame of the iron gate of an elephant yard. A\r\nwren will build in a tin can, a piece of drain tile, a lantern, a\r\nbird house or a coat pocket, just as blithely as its grandmother\r\nbuilt in a grape arbor over a kitchen door. All this is the hall\r\nmark of New Thought.\r\n\r\nWhenever children go afield in bird country, they are constantly\r\non the alert for fresh discoveries and surprises in bird\r\narchitecture. Interest in the nest-building ingenuity and\r\nmechanical skill of birds is perpetual. The variety is almost\r\nendless. Dull indeed is the mind to which a cunningly contrived\r\nnest does not appeal. Tell the boys that it is _all right_ to\r\ncollect _abandoned_ nests, but the taking of eggs and\r\noccupied nests is unlawful and wicked.\r\n\r\nThe Play-House of the Bower Bird. Years ago we read of the\r\nwonderful playhouses constructed by the bower birds of Australia\r\nand New Guinea, but nothing ever brought home to us this\r\nremarkable manifestation of bird thought so closely as did the\r\nsight of our own satin bower bird busily at work on his own bower.\r\nHe was quartered in the great indoor flying cage of our largest\r\nbird house, and supplied with hard grass stems of the right sort\r\nfor bower-making.\r\n\r\nWith those materials, scattered over the sand floor, the bird\r\nbuilt his bower by taking each stem in his beak, holding it very\r\nfirmly and then with a strong sidewise and downward thrust\r\nslicking it upright in the sand, to stand and to point \"just\r\nexactly so.\" The finished bower was a Gothic tunnel with walls of\r\ngrass stems, about eighteen inches long and a foot high. In making\r\nit the male bird wrought as busily as a child building a playhouse\r\nof blocks. Our bird would pick up pieces of blue yarn that had\r\nbeen placed in his cage to test his color sense, but never red,--\r\nwhich color seemed to displease him. As the bird worked quietly\r\nyet diligently, one could not help longing to know what thoughts\r\nwere at work in that busy little brain.\r\n\r\nThe most elaborate of all the bower bird play-houses is that\r\nconstructed by the gardener bower bird, which is thus described by\r\nPycraft in his \"History of Birds\":\r\n\r\n\"This species builds at the foot of a small tree a kind of hut or\r\ncabin, some two feet in height, roofed with orchid stems that\r\nslope to the ground, regularly radiating from the central support,\r\nwhich is covered with a conical mass of moss sheltering a gallery\r\nround it. One side of this hut is left open, and in front of it is\r\narranged a bed of verdant moss, bedecked with blossoms and berries\r\nof the brightest color. As the ornaments wither they are removed\r\nto a heap behind the hut and replaced by others that are fresh.\r\nThe hut is circular and some three feet in diameter, and the mossy\r\nlawn in front of it is nearly twice that expanse. Each hut and garden\r\nis believed to be the work of a single pair of birds. The use of the\r\nhut, it appears, is solely to serve the purpose of a playing-ground,\r\nor as a place wherein to pay court to the female, since it, like the\r\nbowers built by its near relatives, are built long before the nest\r\nis begun, this, by  the way, being placed in a tree.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration with caption: SPOTTED BOWER-BIRD, AT WORK ON ITS\r\nUNFINISHED BOWER Foreground garnished with the bird's playthings.\r\n(From A. S. Le Souef, Sydney. Photo by F. C. Morse)]\r\n\r\nMost Birds Fear Man. With the exception of those that have been\r\nreared in captivity, nearly all species of wild birds, either in\r\ncaptivity or out of it, fear the touch of man, and shrink from\r\nhim. The birds of the lawn, the orchard and the farm are always\r\nsuspicious, always on the defensive. But of course there are\r\nexceptions. A naturalist like J. Alden Loring can by patient\r\neffort win the confidence of a chickadee, or a phoebe bird, and\r\nbring it literally to his finger. These exceptions, however, are\r\nrare, but they show conclusively that wild birds can be educated\r\ninto new ideas.\r\n\r\nThe shrinking of wild birds from the hand of man is almost as\r\npronounced in captivity as it is in the wilderness, and this fact\r\nrenders psychological experiments with birds extremely difficult.\r\nIt is really strange that the parrots and cockatoos all should\r\ntake kindly to man, trust him and even like him, while nearly all\r\nother birds persistently fly, or run, or swim or dive away from\r\nhim. A bird keeper may keep for twenty years, feeding daily, but\r\nhis hawks, owls and eagles, the perchers, waders, swimmers and\r\nupland game birds all fly from him in nervous fear whenever he\r\nattempts to handle them. The exceptions to this rule, out of the\r\n20,000 species of the birds of the world, are few.\r\n\r\nWild Birds that Voluntarily Associate with Man. The species that\r\nwill do so are not numerous, and I will confine myself to some of\r\nthose that I have seen.\r\n\r\nThe Indian adjutant, the mynah, hoopoe, vulture, robin, phoebe\r\nbird, bluebird, swallow, barn owl, flicker, oriole, jay, magpie,\r\ncrow, purple grackle, starling, stork, wood pigeon, Canada goose,\r\nmallard, pintail, bob white and a few other species have accepted\r\nman at his face value and endeavored to establish with him a\r\nmodus vivendi. The mallard and the graylag goose are the ancestors\r\nof our domestic ducks and geese. The jungle fowls have given us\r\nthe domestic chickens. The wild turkey, the pheasants, the guinea\r\nfowl, the ostrich, the emu and the peacock we possess in\r\ndomestication unchanged.\r\n\r\nCaged Wild Birds Quickly Appreciate Sanctuary. Mr. Crandall\r\nreports that in the Zoological Park there have been many instances\r\nof the voluntary return to their cages of wild birds that have\r\nescaped from them. The following instances are cited, out of many\r\nthat are remembered:\r\n\r\nA wild hermit thrush, only two weeks in captivity, escaped from an\r\noutdoor cage. But he refused to leave the vicinity of his new\r\nhome, and permanent food supply. He lingered around for two or\r\nthree days, and finally a wise keeper opened the cage door when he\r\nwas near it, and at once he went in.\r\n\r\nA magpie escaped from an outside cage, and for a week he lingered\r\naround it unwilling to leave its vicinity. At last the other birds\r\nof the cage were removed, the door was left open, and the magpie\r\nat once went back home.\r\n\r\nBird Memory and Talk. Birds have few ways and means by which to\r\nreveal their powers of memory. The best exhibits are made by the\r\ntalking parrots and cockatoos. The feats of some of these birds,\r\nboth in memory and expression, are really wonderful. The startling\r\naptness with which some parrots apply the language they possess\r\noften is quite uncanny. Concerning \"sound mimicry\" and the\r\nefforts of memory on which they are based, Mr. Lee S. Crandall,\r\nCurator of Birds, has contributed the following statement of his\r\nobservations:\r\n\r\n\"Many birds, including practically all members of the parrot\r\ntribe, many of the crows and jays, as well as mynas and starlings,\r\nlearn to repeat sounds, words and sentences. Ability varies with\r\nboth species and individuals. Certain species show greater\r\naptitude as a whole than other species, while there is a great\r\ndifference between individuals of the same species. \"Gray\r\nparrots are generally considered the most intelligent of their\r\ntribe, and are especially apt at imitating sounds, such as running\r\nwater, whistles, etc. I have one at home which always answers a\r\nknock with 'Come in.' Often he furnishes the knock himself by\r\npounding the perch with his bill, following it with 'Come in.'\r\nAmazon parrots are especially good at tunes, some specimens being\r\nable to whistle complicated airs and sometimes sing several verses\r\nin a high, clear voice. Both grays and Amazons often talk with\r\ngreat fluency, vocabularies having been reported of as many as one\r\nhundred words. Often there seems to be intelligent association of\r\ncertain acts or conditions with corresponding sentences, these\r\nsometimes occurring with singular patness.\r\n\r\n\"Hill mynahs, of the genus _Eulabes,_ often talk as well as\r\nparrots. The common introduced European starling often says a few\r\nwords quite clearly. I once knew a long-tailed glossy starling\r\n(_Lamprotornis caudatus_) which shared an aviary with an\r\naccomplished albino jackdaw. The starling had acquired much of the\r\njackdaw's repertoire, and the 'conversations' carried on between\r\nthe two birds were most amusing.\"\r\n\r\nA raven in the Zoological Park says \"Arthur,\" \"Shut up,\" \"All out\"\r\nand \"Now look what's here\" as perfectly as any parrot.\r\n\r\nListed in the order of their ability to learn and remember talk,\r\nthe important talking birds are as follows: African gray parrot,\r\nyellow-headed Amazon, other Amazons, the hill mynahs, the\r\ncockatoos, the macaws, and the various others previously\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nIt is safe to assert that all migratory birds display excellent\r\npowers of memory, chiefly by returning to their favorite haunts\r\nafter long absences.\r\n\r\nRecognition of Persons. Mr. Crandall says there can be no doubt of\r\nthe ability of most birds to recognize individual persons. This is\r\nseen in the smallest species as well as in the largest. He once\r\nsaw a bullfinch in the last stages of pneumonia and almost\r\ncomatose, show an instant reaction to the presence of an owner it\r\nhad not seen in weeks. Many birds form dislikes for individual\r\npersons. This is especially noticeable in the parrot tribe. A\r\nlarge male South American condor was friendly enough with two of\r\nhis keepers but would instantly attack any other keeper or other\r\nperson entering his enclosure, whether wearing the uniform or not.\r\nWith his two approved keepers he was gentleness itself.\r\n\r\nParasitic Nesting Habits. In the bird world there are a few\r\nspecies whose members are determined to get something for nothing,\r\nand to avoid all labor in the rearing of their offspring. This\r\nbad habit is known of the Old World cuckoos, the American cow-\r\nbirds, the South American rice grackle (_Cassidix_), and\r\nsuspected in the pin-tail whydah (_Vidua serena_). It seems\r\nto reach its highest point in the cuckoos. It is believed that\r\nindividuals lay their eggs only in the nests of species whose eggs\r\nresemble their own. Apparently much skill and intelligence is\r\nrequired for introducing parasitic eggs at the most favorable\r\nmoment. This is equally true of other parasites.\r\n\r\nCurator Crandall has taken several eggs and young of the rice\r\nbirds from nests of two species of giant caciques in Costa Rica,\r\nbut never saw an adult _Cassidix._ It is considered a very\r\nrare species, but probably is more sly than scarce. Young cuckoos\r\neject unwelcome nestlings shortly after hatching.\r\n\r\nDaily contact with a large and varied collection of birds great\r\nand small, gathered from every section of the habitable regions of\r\nthe earth, naturally produces in time a long series of interesting\r\ncases of intelligence and behavior. Out of our total occurrences\r\nand observations I will offer two that reveal original thought.\r\n\r\nGood Sense of the Wedge-Tailed Eagle. In discussing bird\r\nintelligence with Mr. Herbert D. Atkin, keeper of our Eagles\r\nAviary and the cranes and water birds in the Flying Cage, he\r\ncalled to my attention two species of birds which had very much\r\nimpressed him. Afterward he showed me all that he described.\r\nKeeper Atkin regards the wedge-tailed eagle, of Australia, as the\r\nwisest species with which he has to deal. In the first place, all\r\nfour of the birds in that flock recognize the fact that he is a\r\ngood friend, not an enemy, and each day they receive him in their\r\nmidst with cheerful confidence and friendship. In the fall when\r\nthe time comes to catch them, crate them and wheel them half a\r\nmile to their winter quarters in the Ostrich House, they do not\r\nbecome frightened, nor fight against being handled, and submit\r\nwith commendable sense and appreciation.\r\n\r\nThe one thing on which the wedge-tailed eagle really insists when\r\nin his summer quarters, is his daily spray bath from a hose. When\r\nhis keeper goes in to give the daily morning wash to the cage, the\r\neagles perch close above his head and screech and scream until the\r\nspray is turned upon them. Then they spread their wings, to get it\r\nthoroughly, and come out thoroughly soaked. When the spray is\r\nmerely turned upon their log instead of upon the birds as they\r\nsit higher up, they fly down and get into the current wherever it\r\nmay be.\r\n\r\nMemory of the Cereopsis Goose. Keeper Atkin also showed me an\r\ninstance of the wisdom of the cereopsis geese, from Van Diemens\r\nLand, South Australia. During the winter those birds are kept in\r\nthe Wild-Fowl Pond; but in summer they are quartered in a secluded\r\nyard of the Crane's Paddock, nearly half a mile away. Twice a year\r\nthese birds go under their own steam between those two enclosures.\r\nWhen turned out of the Cranes' Paddock last November they at once\r\nset out and walked very briskly southward up the Bird's Valley,\r\npast the Zebra House. On reaching the Service Road, a quarter of a\r\nmile away, they turned to the left and kept on to the Wolf Dens.\r\nThere they turned to the right and kept on two hundred yards until\r\nthey reached the walk coming down from the Reptile House. There\r\nthey turned to the left, crossed the bridge, stopped at the gate\r\nto the Wild-Fowl Pond enclosure, and when the gate was opened they\r\nentered and declared themselves \"at home.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Atkin says that in spring these birds show just as much\r\ninterest in going back to their summer home. Falconry. We cannot\r\ndo otherwise than regard the ancient sport of falconry as a high\r\ntribute to the mental powers of the genus _Falco._ The\r\nhunting falcons were educated into the sport of hawking, just as a\r\nboy is trained by his big brother to shoot quail on the wing. The\r\nbirds were furnished with hoods and jesses, and other garnitures.\r\nThey were carried on the hand of the huntsman, and launched at\r\nunlucky herons and bitterns as an _intelligent_ living force.\r\nThe hunting falcon entered into the sport like a true sportsman,\r\nand he played the game according to the rules. The sport was\r\ncruel, but it was politely exciting, and it certainly was a fine\r\nexhibition of bird intelligence. Part of that intelligence was\r\ninstinctive, but the most of it was acquired, by educational\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nOutstanding Traits in a Few Groups of Birds. In creatures as much\r\nlacking in visible expression as most birds are, it is difficult\r\nto detect the emotions and temperaments that prevail in the\r\nvarious groups. Only a few can be cited with certain confidence.\r\n\r\nVanity Displays in Birds. The males of a few species of birds have\r\nbeen specially equipped by nature for the display of their natural\r\nvanity. Anyone who has seen a Zoological Park peacock working\r\novertime on a Sunday afternoon in summer when the crowds of\r\nvisitors are greatest, solely to display the ocellated splendor of\r\nhis tail plumage, surely must conclude that the bird is well aware\r\nof the glories of his tail, and also that he positively enjoys\r\nshowing off to admiring audiences.\r\n\r\nThese displays are not casual affairs in the ordinary course of\r\nthe day's doings. It is a common thing for one of our birds to\r\nchoose a particularly conspicuous spot, preferably on an elevated\r\nterrace, from which his display will carry farthest to the eyes of\r\nthe crowd. Even if the bird were controlled by the will of a\r\ntrainer for the purpose of vanity display, the exhibition could\r\nnot possibly be more perfect. Like a good speaker on a rostrum,\r\nthe bird faces first in one direction and then in another, and\r\noccasionally with a slow and stately movement it completely\r\nrevolves on its axis for the benefit of those in the rear. \"Vain\r\nas a peacock\" is by no means an unjustifiable comparison.\r\n\r\nPlumage displays are indulged in by turkeys, the blue bird of\r\nparadise, the greater and lesser birds of paradise, the sage\r\ngrouse and pinnated grouse, ruffed grouse, golden pheasant and\r\nargus pheasant.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, we may fairly set down vanity as one of the well\r\ndefined emotions in certain birds, and probably possessed by the\r\nmales in many species which have not been provided by nature with\r\nthe means to display it conspicuously.\r\n\r\nMaterials for Study. In seeking means by which to study the mental\r\nand temperamental traits of wild birds and mammals, the definite\r\nand clearly cut manifestations are so few in kind that we are glad\r\nto seize upon everything available. Of the visible evidences,\r\npugnacity and the fighting habit are valuable materials, because\r\nthey are visible. Much can be learned from the fighting weakness\r\nor strength of animals and men.\r\n\r\nIn our great collections of birds drawn from all the land areas of\r\nthe globe, our bird men see much fighting. Mr. Crandall has\r\nprepared for me in a condensed form an illuminating collection of\r\nfacts regarding\r\n\r\nPUGNACITY IN CAPTIVE BIRDS\r\n\r\n1. Most species do more or less competitive fighting for nesting\r\nsites or mates, especially:\r\n\r\nGallinaceous birds,--many of which fight furiously for mates;\r\n\r\nThe Ruff, or Fighting Snipe (_Machetes pugnax_),--very\r\npugnacious for mates;\r\n\r\nHouse Sparrows (_Passer domesticus_) fight for nesting places\r\nand mates; and\r\n\r\nSome Waterfowl, especially swans and geese, fight for nesting\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n2. Most species which do not depend chiefly upon concealment,\r\nfight fiercely in defense of nests or young. Typical examples are:\r\n\r\nGeese;\r\n\r\nSwans;\r\n\r\nThe larger Flycatchers;\r\n\r\nBirds of prey, especially the more powerful ones, such as Bald\r\nEagles, Duck Hawks and Horned Owls.\r\n\r\n3. Some species fight in competition for food. Conspicuous\r\nexamples are:\r\n\r\nThe fiercer hawks;\r\n\r\nSome carrion eaters, as the King Vulture, Black, Sharp-Shinned,\r\nCooper, Gos and Duck Hawks, which fight in the air over prey.\r\n\r\n4. Certain birds show pugnacity in connection with the robber\r\ninstinct, as:\r\n\r\nBald Eagle, which robs the Osprey;\r\n\r\nSkua and Jaeger, which rob gulls.\r\n\r\n5. Some species show general pugnacity. Species to be cited are:\r\n\r\nCassowaries, Emus and Ostriches, all of which are more or less\r\ndangerous;\r\n\r\nSaras Cranes, which strike wickedly and without warning;\r\n\r\nSome Herons, especially if confined, and\r\n\r\nBirds of Paradise, which are unreasonably quarrelsome.\r\n\r\n6. In non-social birds, each male will fight for his own breeding\r\nand feeding territory. The struggle for territory is a wide one,\r\nand it is now attracting the attention of bird psychologists.\r\n\r\nBirds are no more angelic than human beings are. They have their\r\nfaults and their mean traits, just as we have; but their\r\nrepertoire is not so great as ours. In every species that we have\r\nseen tried out in captivity, the baser passions are present. This\r\nis equally true of mammals. In _confinement_, in every herd\r\nand in every flock from elephants down to doves, the strong bully\r\nand oppress the weak, and drive them to the wall.\r\n\r\n_The most philosophic and companionable birds_ are the\r\nparrots, parakeets, macaws and cockatoos.\r\n\r\n_The birds that most quickly recognize protection_\r\nsanctuaries and accept them, are the geese, ducks and swans.\r\n\r\n_The game birds most nervous and foolish, and difficult to\r\nmaintain in captivity,_ are the grouse, ptarmigan and quail.\r\n\r\n_The bird utterly destitute of sense_ in captivity is the\r\nloon.\r\n\r\n_The birds that are most domineering_ in captivity are the\r\ncranes.\r\n\r\n_The birds that are most treacherous_ in captivity are the\r\ndarters (_Anhinga_).\r\n\r\n_The birds that go easiest and farthest in training_ are the\r\nparrots, macaws and cockatoos.\r\n\r\n_The most beautiful bird species of the world_ are about\r\nfifty in number; and only a few of them are found among the birds\r\nof paradise.\r\n\r\nThe minds of wild birds are quite as varied and diversified as are\r\nthe forms and habits of the different orders and genera. XVI\r\n\r\nTHE WISDOM OF THE SERPENT\r\n\r\nOF all the vertebrates, the serpents live under the greatest\r\nhandicaps. They are hated and destroyed by all men, they can\r\nneither run nor fly far away, and they subsist under maximum\r\ndifficulties. Those of the temperate zone are ill fitted to\r\nwithstand the rigors of winter.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the serpents survive; and we have not heard of any species\r\nhaving become extinct during our own times.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed worth while to \"consider the wisdom of the serpent.\"\r\nWithout the exercise of keen intelligence all the snakes of the\r\ncultivated lands of the world long ago would have been\r\nexterminated. The success of serpents of all species in meeting\r\nnew conditions and maintaining their existence in the face of\r\nenormous difficulties compels us, as reasoning beings, to accord\r\nto them keen intelligence and ratiocination.\r\n\r\nThe poisonous serpents afford a striking illustration of reason\r\nand folly en masse. The total number of venomous species is really\r\ngreat, and their distribution embraces practically the whole of\r\nthe torrid and temperate zones. They are too numerous for mention\r\nhere; and their capacity for mischief to man is very great. Our\r\nown country has at least eighteen species of poisonous snakes,\r\nincluding the rattlesnakes, the copperhead, moccasin, and coral\r\nsnakes. All these, however, are remarkably pacific. Without\r\nexception they are non-aggressive, and they attack only when they\r\nthink they are exposed to danger, and must defend themselves or\r\ndie. Hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of our people have\r\ntramped through the woods and slept in the sage-brush and creosote\r\nbushes of the rattlesnake, and waded through swamps full of\r\nmoccasins, with never a bite. In America only about two persons\r\nper year are bitten by _wild_ rattlesnakes.\r\n\r\nOur snakes, and all but a very few of the other poison-snake\r\nspecies of the world, know that _it pays to keep the peace._\r\nNow, what if all snakes were as foolishly aggressive as the hooded\r\nand spectacled cobras of India? Let us see.\r\n\r\nThose cobra species are man-haters. They love to attack and do\r\ndamage. They go out of their way to bite people. They crawl into\r\nhuts and bungalows, especially during the monsoon rains, and they\r\ninfest thatch roofs. But are they wise, and retiring, like the\r\nhouse-haunting gopher snake of the South?\r\n\r\nBy no means. The cobra goes around with a chip on his shoulder. In\r\nIndia they kill from 17,000 to 18,000 people annually! And in\r\nreturn, about 117,000 cobras are killed annually. It is a mighty\r\nfortunate thing for humanity on the frontier that the other\r\nserpents of the world know that it is a good thing to behave\r\nthemselves, and not bite unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nFighting Its Own Kind. The Indian cobra, (_Naia tripudians_),\r\nis an exception to the rule of serpents that forbids fighting in\r\nthe family. While cobras in captivity usually do live together in\r\na state of vicious and fully-armed neutrality, sometimes they do\r\nfight. One of our cobras once attacked a cage-mate two-thirds the\r\nsize of itself, vanquished it, seized it by the head and swallowed\r\ntwo-thirds of it before the tragedy was discovered. The assailant\r\nwas compelled to disgorge his prey, but the victim was very dead.\r\n\r\nThe poison venom of the cobra, rattlesnake, bushmaster and puff\r\nadder is a great handicap on the social standing of the entire\r\nserpent family. Mankind in general abhors snakes, both in general\r\nand particular. The snake not actually known to be venomous\r\nusually is suspected of being so. It is only the strongest mental\r\nconstitution that can permit a snake to go unkilled when the\r\nkilling opportunity offers. It is just as natural for the lay\r\nbrother to kill a chicken snake because it looks like a\r\ncopperhead, or a hog-nosed blowing \"viper\" because it looks like a\r\nrattlesnake, as it is to shy at a gun that \"may be loaded.\"\r\n\r\nTo American plainsmen, the non-aggressive temper of the\r\nrattlesnake is well known, and it is also a positive asset. I\r\nnever knew one who was nervously afraid while sleeping in the open\r\nthat snakes would come and crawl into his bed, or mix up with his\r\ncamp. Of course all frontiersmen kill rattlers, as a sort of\r\nbounden duty to society, but I once knew an eastern man to turn\r\nloose a rattlesnake that he had photographed, in the observance\r\nof his principle never to kill an animal whose picture he had\r\ntaken. Subsequently it was gravely reported that one of the\r\nrestive horses of the outfit had \"accidentally\" killed that\r\nrattler by stepping upon it.\r\n\r\nA Summary of Poisonous Snakes. There are about 300,000 poisonous\r\nsnakes in the United States, and 110,000,000 people for them to\r\nbite; but more people are bitten by captive snakes than by wild\r\nones.\r\n\r\nA fool and his snake are soon parted.\r\n\r\nThere are 200,000 rattlesnakes in our country, but all of them\r\nwill let you alone if you will let them alone.\r\n\r\nIf your police record is clear, you can sleep safely in the sage-\r\nbrush.\r\n\r\nIf ever you need to camp in a cave, remember that in warm weather\r\nthe rattlesnakes are all out hunting, and will not return until\r\nthe approach of winter.\r\n\r\nThe largest snakes of the world exist only in the human mind.\r\n\r\nThe rattlesnake is a world-beater at minding his own business.\r\n\r\nMen do far more fighting per capita than any snakes yet\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nThe road to an understanding of the minds of serpents is long and\r\ndifficult. Perhaps the best initial line of approach is through a\r\nwell-stocked Reptile House. Having studied somewhat\r\nin that school I have emerged with a fixed belief that of all\r\nvertebrate creatures, snakes are the least understood, and also\r\nthe most thoroughly misunderstood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A\r\nPEACE CONFERENCE WITH AN ARIZONA RATTLESNAKE \"You let me alone and\r\nI won't harm you\" (From \"Camp-Fires on Desert and Lava\")]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAWK-PROOF NEST OF A CACTUS WREN Placed in the\r\ncentre of a tree choya cactus of Arizona and defended by 10 000\r\nhostile spines (From \"Camp-Fires on Desert and Lava\")]\r\n\r\nThe world at large debits serpents with being far more quarrelsome\r\nand aggressive than they really are, and it credits them with\r\nknowing far less than they do know.\r\n\r\nAttitude of Snakes Toward Each Other. Toward each other, the\r\nmembers of the various serpent species are tolerant, patient and\r\npeaceful to the last degree. You may place together in one cage\r\ntwenty big Texas rattlers, or twenty ugly cottonmouth moccasins\r\nfrom the Carolinas, a hundred garter snakes, twenty boa\r\nconstrictors, or six big pythons, and if the various\r\n_species_ are kept separate there will be no fighting. You\r\nmay stir them up to any reasonable extent, and make them keen to\r\nstrike you, but they do not attack each other.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, many species that will not mix together in\r\npeace. For example, the king snake of New Jersey hates the\r\nrattlesnake, no matter what his address may be. Being by habit a\r\nconstrictor, the king snake at once winds himself tightly around\r\nthe neck of the rattler,--and proceeds to choke him to death.\r\n\r\nThe king cobra devours other snakes, as food, and wishes nothing\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nThe Gopher Snake. Some snakes that feel sure you will not harm\r\nthem will permit you to handle them without a protest or a fight.\r\nThe most spectacular example is the gopher snake of the\r\nsoutheastern United States. This handsome, lustrous, blue-black\r\nspecies is six feet long, shiny, and as clean and smooth as ivory.\r\nIts members are famous rat-killers. You can pick up a wild one\r\nwherever you find it, and it will not bite you. They do not at all\r\nobject to being handled, even by timorous lady visitors who never\r\nbefore have touched a live snake; and in the South they are\r\ntolerated by farmers for the good they do as rat catchers.\r\n\r\nThe Wisdom of a Big Python. Once I witnessed an example of snake\r\nintelligence on a large scale, which profoundly impressed me.\r\n\r\nA reticulated python about twenty-two feet long arrived from\r\nSingapore with its old skin dried down upon its body. The snake\r\nhad been many weeks without a bath, and it had been utterly unable\r\nto shed its old skin on schedule time. It was necessary to remove\r\nall that dead epidermis, without delay.\r\n\r\nThe great serpent, fully coiled, was taken out of its box, sprayed\r\nwith warm water, and gently deposited on the gravel floor of our\r\nmost spacious python apartment. Later on pails of warm water,\r\nsponges and forceps were procured, and five strong keepers were\r\nassembled for active service.\r\n\r\nThe first step was to get the snake safely into the hands of the\r\nmen, and fully under control. A stream of cold water from a hose\r\nwas suddenly shot in a deluge upon the python's head, and while it\r\nwas disconcerted and blinded by the flood, it was seized by the\r\nneck, close behind the head. Immediately the waiting keepers\r\nseized it by the body, from neck to tail, and straightened it out,\r\nto prevent coiling. Strong hands subdued its struggles, and\r\nwithout any violence stretched the writhing wild monster upon the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nThen began the sponging and peeling process. The frightened snake\r\nwrithed and resisted, probably feeling sure that its last hour had\r\ncome. The men worked quietly, spoke soothingly, and the work\r\nproceeded successfully. With the lapse of time the serpent became\r\naware of the fact that it was not to be harmed; for it became\r\nquiet, and lay still. At the same time, we all dreaded the crisis\r\nthat we thought would come when the jaws and the head would be\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nBy the time the head was reached, the snake lay perfectly passive.\r\nBeyond all doubt, it understood the game that was being played.\r\n\r\nNow, the epidermis of a snake covers the entire head, _including\r\nthe eyes!_ And what would that snake do when the time came to\r\nremove the scales from its eyes and lips? It continued to lie\r\nperfectly still! When the pulling off of the old skin hurt the new\r\nskin underneath, the head flinched slightly, just as any hurt\r\nflesh will flinch by reflex action; but that was absolutely all.\r\nFor a long hour or more, and even when the men pulled the dead\r\nscales from those eyes and lips, that strange creature made no\r\nresistance or protest. I have seen many people fight their doctors\r\nfor less.\r\n\r\nThat wild, newly-caught jungle snake quickly had recognized the\r\nsituation, and acted its part with a degree of sense and\r\nappreciation that was astounding. I do not know of any _adult\r\nwild_ mammal that would have shown that kind and degree of\r\nwisdom under similar circumstances.\r\n\r\nDo Snakes \"Charm\" Birds? Sometimes a wild bird will sit still upon\r\nits nest while a big pilot blacksnake, or some other serpent\r\nequally bad, climbs up and poises its head before the motionless\r\nand terrified bird until at last the serpent seizes the bird to\r\ndevour it. The bird victim really seems to be \"charmed\" by its\r\nenemy. If there were not some kind of a hypnotic spell cast over\r\nthe bird, would it not fly away?\r\n\r\nI think this strange proceeding is easily explainable by any one\r\nwith sufficient imagination to put himself in the bird's place. It\r\nis the rule of a sitting bird to sit tight, not to be scared off\r\nby trifles, and to take great risks rather than expose her eggs to\r\ncold and destruction. The ascent and approach of the serpent is\r\nabsolutely noiseless. Not a leaf is stirred. The potential mother\r\nof a brood calmly sits with eyes half closed, at peace with all\r\nthe world. Suddenly, and with a horrible shock, she discovers a\r\ndeadly serpent's multi-fanged head and glittering eyes staring at\r\nher _within easy striking distance._\r\n\r\nThe horrified mother bird feels that she is lost. She knows full\r\nwell that with any movement to escape the serpent instantly will\r\nlaunch its attack. _Her one hope,_ and seemingly her only\r\nchance for life, is that _if she remains motionless_ the\r\nserpent will go its way without harming her. (Think of the\r\nthousands of helpless men, women and children who have hoped and\r\nacted similarly in the presence of bandits and hold-up men\r\npresenting loaded revolvers! But they were far from being\r\n\"charmed.\")\r\n\r\nThe bird hopes, and sits still, _paralyzed with fear._ At its\r\nleisure the serpent strikes; and after a certain number of\r\nhorrible minutes, all is over. I think there is no real \"charm\"\r\nexercised in the tragedy; but that there is on the part of the\r\nbird a paralysis of fear, which is in my opinion a well defined\r\nemotion, common in animals and in men. I have seen it in many\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nSnakes that Feign Death. The common hog-nosed snake, mistakenly\r\ncalled the \"puff-adder\" and blowing \"viper\" (_Heterodon\r\nplatyrhinus_) of the New England states, often feigns death\r\nwhen it is caught in the open, and picked up. It will \"play\r\n'possum\" while you carry it by its tail, head downward, or hang\r\nits limp body over a fence. Of course it hopes to escape by its\r\nvery clever ruse, and no doubt it often does so from the hands of\r\ninexperienced persons.\r\n\r\nDo Snakes Swallow Their Young? I _think_ not. A number of\r\npersons solemnly have declared that they have seen snakes do so,\r\nbut no _herpetologist_ ever has seen an occurrence of that\r\nkind. I believe that all of the best authorities on serpents\r\nbelieve that snakes do not swallow their young. The theory of the\r\npro-swallowists is that the mother snake takes her young into her\r\ninterior to provide for their safety, and that they do not go as\r\nfar down as the stomach. The anti-swallowists declare that the\r\npowerful digestive juices of the stomach of a snake would quickly\r\nkill any snakelets coming in contact with it; and I believe that\r\nthis is true.\r\n\r\nAt present the snake-swallowing theory must be ticketed \"not\r\nproven,\" and is filed for further reference.\r\n\r\nThe Hoop Snake Fable. There is no such thing as a \"hoop-snake\"\r\nsave in the vivid imaginations of a very few men.\r\n\r\nThe Intelligence of the King Cobra. Curator of Reptiles Raymond\r\nL. Ditmars regards the huge king cobra of the Malay Peninsula, the\r\nlargest of all poisonous serpents, as quite the wisest serpent\r\nknown to him. He says its mind is alert and responsive to a very\r\nunusual degree in serpents, and that it manifests a keen interest\r\nin everything that is going on around it, especially at feeding-\r\ntime. This is quite the reverse of the usual sluggish and\r\napathetic serpent mind in captivity.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, I would like very much to know just what our present\r\ntwelve-foot cobra thought when, upon its arrival at its present\r\nhome, its total blindness was relieved by the thrillingly skilful\r\nremoval of the _two layers_ of dead scales that had closed\r\nover and finally adhered to each orbit.\r\n\r\nThe vision of the king cobra is keen, and its temper is not easily\r\nruffled. Its temperament seems to be sanguine, which is just the\r\nopposite of the nervous-combative hooded and spectacled cobra\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe So-called \"Snake Charmers\" of India. Herpetologists generally\r\ndiscredit the idea that a peripatetic Hindu can \"charm\" a cobra\r\nany farther or more quickly than any snake-keeper. In the first\r\nplace, the fangs of the serpent are totally removed,--by a very\r\nsavage and painful process. After that, the unfortunate snake is\r\nin no condition to fight or to flee. It seeks only to be let\r\nalone, and the musical-pipe business is to impress the mind of the\r\nobserver.\r\n\r\nSerpent Psychology an Unplowed Field. At this date (1922) we know\r\nonly the rudiments of serpent intelligence and temperament. In the\r\nwilds, serpents are most elusive and difficult to determine. In\r\ncaptivity they are passive and undemonstrative. We do not know how\r\nmuch memory they have, they rarely show what they think, and on\r\nmost subjects we do not know where they stand. But the future will\r\nchange all this. During the past twenty years the number of\r\nherpetologists in the United States has increased about tenfold.\r\nIt is fairly impossible that serpent psychology should much longer\r\nremain unstudied, and unrevealed along the lines of plain common-\r\nsense.\r\n\r\nThe Ways of Crocodiles. The ways of crocodiles are dark and deep;\r\ntheir thoughts are few and far between. Their wisdom is above that\r\nof the tortoises and turtles, but below that of the serpents. I\r\nhave had field experience with four species of crocodilians in the\r\nNew World and three in the Old. With but slight exceptions they\r\nall think alike and act alike.\r\n\r\nThe great salt-water crocodile of the Malay Peninsula and Borneo\r\nis the only real man-eater I ever met. Except under the most\r\nprovocative circumstances, all the others I have met are\r\npractically harmless to man. This includes the Florida species,\r\nthe Orinoco crocodile, the little one from Cuba, the alligator,\r\nthe Indian gavial and the Indian crocodile (_C. palustris_).\r\n\r\nThe salt-water crocodile, that I have seen swimming out in the\r\nocean two miles or more from shore, is in Borneo a voracious man-\r\neater. It skilfully stalks its prey in the murky rivers where\r\nMalay and Dyak women and children come down to the village bathing\r\nplace to dip up water and to bathe. There, unseen in the muddy\r\nwater, the monster glides up stealthily, seizes his victim by the\r\nleg, and holding it tightly backs off into deep water and\r\ndisappears. The victims are drowned, not bitten to death.\r\n\r\nI found in Ceylon that the Indian crocodile is a shameless\r\ncannibal, devouring the skinned carcasses of its relatives\r\nwhenever an opportunity offered.\r\n\r\nThe Florida crocodile is the shrewdest species of all those I know\r\npersonally. It has the strange habit of digging out deep and\r\nspacious burrows for concealment, in the perpendicular sandy\r\nbanks of southern Florida rivers where the deep water comes right\r\nup to the shore. Starting well under low-water mark, the crock\r\ndigs in the yielding sand, straight into the bank, a roomy\r\nsubterranean chamber. In this snug retreat he once was safe from\r\nall his enemies,--until the fatal day when his secret was\r\ndiscovered, and revealed to a grasping world. Since that time, the\r\nAlligator Joes of Palm Beach and Miami have made a business of\r\npersonally conducting parties of northern visitors, at $50 per\r\ncatch, to witness the adventure of catching a nine-foot crocodile\r\nalive. The dens are located by probing the sand with long iron\r\nrods. A rope noose is set over the den's entrance, and when all is\r\nready, a confederate probes the crocodile out of its den and into\r\nthe fatal noose.\r\n\r\nToday the Florida crocodile is so nearly extinct that it required\r\ntwo years of diligent inquiry to produce one live specimen subject\r\nto purchase.\r\n\r\nCommon Sense in the Common Toad. Last spring, in planting a lot of\r\ntrees on our lawn, a round tree-hole that stood for several days\r\nunoccupied finally accumulated about a dozen toads. Its two feet\r\nof straight depth was unscalable, and when finally discovered the\r\ntoads were tired of their imprisonment. Partly as a test of their\r\ncommon-sense, Mr. George T. Fielding placed a six-inch board in\r\nthe hole, at an angle of about thirty degrees, but fairly leading\r\nout of the trap.\r\n\r\nIn very quick time the toads recognized the possibilities of the\r\ninclined plane and hopped upward to liberty. In the use of this\r\nopportunity they showed more wisdom than our mountain sheep\r\nmanifest concerning the same kind of an improvement designed to\r\nenable them to reach the roof of their building. XVII\r\n\r\nTHE TRAINING OF WILD ANIMALS\r\n\r\nBefore we enter this chapter let us pause a moment on the\r\nthreshold, and consider the logic of animal training and\r\nperformances.\r\n\r\nLogic is only another name for reason. Its reverse side is\r\nfanaticism; and that way madness lies. It is the duty of every\r\nsane man and woman to consider the cold logic of every question\r\naffecting the welfare of man and nature. Fanaticism when carried\r\nto extremes can become a misdemeanor or a crime. The soft-hearted\r\nfanaticism of humanics that saves a brutal murderer, or would-be\r\nmurderer like Berkman, from the gallows or the chair, and\r\neventually turns him loose to commit more crimes against innocent\r\npeople, is not only wrong, and wicked, but in aggravated cases it\r\nis a _crime_ against society.\r\n\r\nJust now there is a tiny wave of agitation against all\r\nperformances of trained wild animals, and the keeping of animals\r\nin captivity, on the ground that all this is \"cruel\" and inhumane.\r\nThe Jacklondon Society of Boston is working hard to get up steam\r\nfor this crusade, but thus far with only partial success. Its\r\ninfluence is confined to a very small area.\r\n\r\nNow, what is the truth of this matter? Is it true that trained\r\nwild animals are cruelly abused in the training, or in compelling\r\nthem to perform? Is it true that in making animals perform on the\r\nstage, or in the circus ring, their rights are wickedly infringed?\r\nIs it the duty of the American people to stop all performances by\r\nanimals? Is it wicked to make wild animals, or cats and dogs,\r\n_work_ for a living, as men and women do? Is it true that\r\ncaptive animals in zoological parks and gardens are miserable and\r\nunhappy, and that all such institutions should be \"abolished?\"\r\nWhat is truth?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, there is no sound reasoning or logic in\r\nassuming that the persons of animals, tame or wild, are any more\r\nsacred than those of men, women and children. We hold that it is\r\nno more \"cruelty\" for an ape or a dog to work in training quarters\r\nor on the stage than it is for men, women and young people to work\r\nas acrobats, or actors, or to engage in honest toil eight hours\r\nper day. Who gave to any warm-blooded animal that consumes food\r\nand requires shelter the right to live without work? _No\r\none!_ I am sure that no trained bear of my acquaintance ever\r\nhad to work as hard for his food and shelter as does the average\r\nbear out in the wilds. In order to find enough to eat the latter\r\nis compelled to hustle hard from dawn till dark. I have seen that\r\nthe Rocky Mountain grizzly feels forced to dig a big hole three\r\nfeet deep in hard, rocky ground, to get one tiny ground squirrel\r\nthe size of a chipmunk,--and weighing only eight or nine ounces.\r\nNow, has he anything \"on\" the performing bear? Decidedly not.\r\n\r\nI regard the sentimental Jacklondon idea, that no wild animal\r\nshould be made to work on the stage or in the show-ring, as\r\nillogical and absurd. Human beings who sanely work are much\r\nhappier per capita than those who do nothing but loaf and grouch.\r\nI have worked, horse-hard, throughout all the adult years of my\r\nlife; and it has been good for me. I know that it is no more wrong\r\nor wicked for a horse to work for his living,--of course on a\r\nhumane basis,--either on the stage or on the street, than it is\r\nfor a coal-carrier, a foundryman, a farmer, a bookkeeper, a school\r\nteacher or a housewife to do the day's work.\r\n\r\nThe person of a wild animal is no more sacred than is that of a\r\nman or woman. A sound whack for an unruly elephant, bear or horse\r\nis just as helpful as it is for an unruly boy who needs to be\r\nshown that order is heaven's first law.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of the world's toiling and sweating millions, in\r\nthe presence of millions of children in the home sweat-shops and\r\nfactories working their little lives out for their daily crust and\r\na hard bed, what shall we think and say of the good, kind-hearted\r\npeople who are spending time and energy in crusading against\r\ntrained animal performances?\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of performing animals are trained by humane men\r\nand women, practicing kindness to the utmost; and they are the\r\nlast persons in the world who would be willing to have their\r\nvaluable stock roughly handled, neglected or in any manner cruelly\r\ntreated.\r\n\r\nSo far as zoological parks and gardens are concerned, they are no\r\nmore in need of defense than the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nEvery large zoological park is a school of wild-animal education\r\nand training; and it is literally a continuous performance. Let\r\nno one suppose that there is no training of wild beasts save for\r\nthe circus ring and the vaudeville stage. Of the total number of\r\nlarge and important mammals that come into our zoological parks,\r\nthe majority of them actually are trained to play becomingly their\r\nrespective parts. An intractable and obstinate animal soon becomes\r\na nuisance.\r\n\r\nThe following, named in the order of their importance, are the\r\nspecies whose zoological park training is a matter of necessity:\r\nElephants, bears, apes, hippopotami, rhinoceroses, giraffes,\r\nbison, musk-ox, wild sheep, goats and deer, African antelopes,\r\nwild swine, and wild horses, asses and zebras. Of large birds the\r\nmost conspicuous candidates for training in park life are the\r\nostriches, emus, cassowaries, cranes, pelicans, swans, egrets and\r\nherons, geese, ducks, pheasants, macaws and cockatoos, curassows,\r\neagles and vultures. Among the reptiles, the best trained are the\r\ngiant tortoises, the pythons, boas, alligators, crocodiles,\r\niguanas and gopher snakes.\r\n\r\nEach one of these species is educated (1) to be peaceful, and not\r\nattack their keepers; (2) to not fear their keepers; (3) to do as\r\nthey are bid about going here or there; (4) to accept and eat the\r\nfood that is provided for them, and (5) finally, in some cases to\r\n\"show off\" a little when commanded, for the benefit of visitors.\r\n\r\nAll this training comes in the regular course of our daily work,\r\nand there are few animals who do not respond to it. The necessity\r\nfor training is most imperative with the elephants and bears, for\r\nwithout it the difficulties in the management of those dangerous\r\nanimals is greatly intensified.\r\n\r\nIn training an animal to do a particular act not in the routine of\r\nhis daily life, it is of course necessary to show him clearly and\r\npointedly what is desired. I think that in quickness of\r\nperception, and ability to adopt a new idea, the elephants and\r\nthe great apes are tied for first place. Both are remarkably\r\nquick. It seems to me that it required only half a dozen lessons\r\nto teach our Indian elephant, Gunda, to take a penny in his trunk,\r\nlift the lid of a high-placed box, drop in the coin, then pull a\r\nbell-cord and ring a bell. Of course the reward for the first\r\nsuccessful performances was lumps of sugar. Within three days this\r\nrather interesting special exhibit was working smoothly, and\r\ncoining money. As a means of working off on the poor animal great\r\nnumbers of foreign copper coins, and spurious issues of all kinds,\r\nit was a great boon to the foreign population of New York. Our\r\nerratic elephant Alice was quickly trained by Keeper Richards to\r\nblow a mouth organ, to ring a telephone by turning the crank, and\r\nto take off the receiver and hold it up to her ear for an\r\nimaginary call.\r\n\r\nAnother keeper, with no previous experience as a trainer, taught a\r\nmale orang-utan called Rajah to go through a series of\r\nperformances that are elsewhere described.\r\n\r\nBright and Dull Individuals. Every wild animal species contains\r\nthe same range of bright and dull individuals that are found in\r\nthe various races of men. Naturally the animal trainer selects for\r\ntraining only those animals that are of amiable disposition, that\r\nmentally are alert, responsive and possessed of good memories. The\r\nworst mistakes they make are in taking on and forcing ill-natured\r\nand irritable animals, that hate training and performing. Often a\r\ntrainer persists in retaining an animal that resolutely should be\r\nthrown out. Captain Bonavita lost his arm solely because of his\r\nfatal persistence in retaining in his group of lions an animal\r\nthat hated him, and which the trainer well knew was dangerous.\r\n\r\nWhile nearly every wild animal can be taught a few simple tricks,\r\nthe dull mind soon reaches its constitutional limit. Even among\r\nthe great apes, conditions are quite the same. One half the orang-\r\nutans are of the thin-headed, pin-headed type that is hopeless for\r\nstage training. The good ones are the stocky, round-headed, round-\r\nfaced individuals who have the cephalic index of the statesman or\r\njurist, and a broad and well-rounded dome of thought.\r\n\r\nTraining for the Ring and the Stage. During his long and\r\nsuccessful career as a purveyor of wild animals for all purposes,\r\nCarl Hagenbeck had great success in the production of large\r\nanimal groups trained for stage performances. I came in close\r\ntouch with his methods and their results. His methods were very\r\nsimple, and they were founded on kindness and common sense. Mr.\r\nHagenbeck hated whips and punishments. When an animal could not\r\nget on without them, it was dropped from the cast. His working\r\ntheory was that an unwilling animal makes a bad actor.\r\n\r\nThere is no mystery about the best methods in training animals,\r\nwild or domestic. The first thing is to assemble a suitable number\r\nof _young_ animals, all of which are mentally bright and\r\nphysically sound. Most adult animals are impracticable, and often\r\nimpossible, because they are set in their ways. The elephants are\r\nmonumental exceptions. A large, well-lighted and sunny room is\r\nprovided; and around it are the individual cages for the student\r\nanimals. The members of the company are fed wisely and well, kept\r\nscrupulously clean, and in all ways made comfortable and\r\ncontented. When not at their work they are allowed to romp and\r\nplay together until they are tired of the exercise.\r\n\r\nThe trainer who has been selected to create a specified group\r\nspends practically his entire time with his pupils. He feeds them,\r\nand mixes with them daily and hourly. From the beginning he\r\nteaches them that _they must obey him, and not fight._\r\nThe work of training begins with simple  things, and goes on\r\nto the complex; and each day the same routine is carried out.\r\nTo each animal is assigned a certain place in the circle, with\r\na certain tub or platform on which to sit at ease when not\r\nacting in the ring. It is exceedingly droll to see a dozen cub\r\nlions, tigers, bears and cheetahs sitting decorously on their\r\nrespective tubs and gravely watching the thirteenth cub who\r\nis being labored with by the keeper to bring its ideas and acts\r\ninto line. The stage properties are many; and they all assist in\r\nhelping the actors to remember the sequence of their acts, as well\r\nas the things to be done. The key that controls the mind of a good\r\nanimal is the reward idea. Many a really bad animal goes through\r\nits share of the performance solely to secure the bit of meat, the\r\nlump of sugar or the prized biscuit that never fails to show up at\r\nthe proper moment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration with caption: WORK ELEPHANT DRAGGING A HEWN TIMBER\r\nThe most primitive form of elephant harness. The end of the drag\r\nrope is held between the teeth of the wise and patient animal\r\n(From A. G. R. Theobald, Mysore)]\r\n\r\nThe acts to be performed are gone over in the training quarters,\r\ninnumerable times; and this continues so long that by the time the\r\n\"group\" is ready for the stage, behold! the cubs with which the\r\npatient and tireless trainer began have grown so large that to the\r\naudience they now seem like adult and savage animals. Those who\r\nscoff at the wild animal mind, and say that all this displays\r\nnothing but \"machines in fur\" need to be reminded that this very\r\nsame line of effort in training and rehearsal is absolutely\r\nnecessary in the production of every military company, every\r\nballet, and every mass performance on the stage. There is\r\n_no_ successful performance without training. Boys and girls\r\nrequire the very same sort of handling that the wild animals\r\nreceive, but the humans do with a little less of it.\r\n\r\nThe man who flouts a good stage performance by wild animals on the\r\nground that it reveals \"no thought,\" and is only \"imitation,\" is,\r\nin my judgment, a very short-sighted student. Maniacs and\r\nimbeciles cannot be trained to perform any program fit to be seen.\r\nI saw that tried fifty years ago, in \"the wild Australian\r\nchildren,\" who were idiots. _The performer must think, and\r\nreason._\r\n\r\nOf the many groups of trained animals that I have seen in\r\nperformances, my mind goes back first to the one which contained\r\na genuine bear comedian, of the Charlie Chaplin type. It was a\r\nHimalayan black bear, with fine side whiskers, and it really\r\nseemed to me absolutely certain that the other animals in the\r\ngroup appreciated and enjoyed the fun that comedian made. He\r\npretended to be awkward, and frequently fell off his tub. He was\r\npurposely dilatory, and was often the last one to finish. The\r\nother animals seemed to be fascinated by his mishaps, and they sat\r\non their tubs and watched him with what looked like genuine\r\namusement. I remember another circle of seated animals who calmly\r\nand patiently sat and watched while the trainer labored with a\r\ncross and refractory leopard, to overcome its stubbornness, and to\r\nmake it do its part.\r\n\r\nCarl Hagenbeck loved to produce mixed groups of dangerous\r\nanimals,--lions, tigers, leopards, bears and wolves. One trainer\r\nwhom I knew was assisted in a highly dangerous group by a noble\r\nstag-hound who habitually kept close to his master, and was said\r\nto be ready to attack instantly any animal that might attack the\r\ntrainer. I never saw a finer bodyguard than that dog.\r\n\r\nIn 1908 the most astounding animal group ever turned out of the\r\nHagenbeck establishment, or shown on any stage, appeared in\r\nLondon. It consisted of _75 full-grown polar bears!_ Now,\r\npolar bears, either for the cage or the stage, are bad citizens.\r\nInstinctively I always suspect their mental reservations, and for\r\ntwenty-one years have carefully kept our keepers out of their\r\nreach. But Mr. William Hagenbeck, brother of the great Carl,\r\nactually trained and performed with a huge _herd_ of\r\ndangerous polars to the number stated.\r\n\r\nIn the _Strand_ magazine for April, 1908, there is a fine\r\narticle by Arthur Harold about this group and its production. It\r\nsays that the bears were obtained when seven or eight months old,\r\nin large lots, and all thrown in together. It took a keeper\r\nbetween seven and eight months to educate them out of their savage\r\nstate,--by contact, kindness, sugar and fruit,--and then they were\r\nturned over to the trainer, Mr. Hagenbeck. They were taught to\r\nform pyramids, climb ladders, shoot the chutes, ride in pony\r\ncarriages, draw and ride in sleds, drink from bottles, and work a\r\nsee-saw. Various individuals did individual tricks. The star\r\nperformer was Monk, the wrestling bear, who went with his trainer\r\nthrough a fearsome wrestling performance.\r\n\r\nConcerning the temperament of that polar bear group Mr. William\r\nHagenbeck said:\r\n\r\n\"Although I know every animal in the company, have taught each one\r\nto recognize me, and have been among many of them for _fifteen\r\nyears,_ I can not now tell by their expressions the moods of\r\nthe animals. This is one of the characteristics of the polar bear.\r\nTheir expression remains the same, and it is impossible to detect\r\nby watching their faces whether they are pleased or cross. Now in\r\nmost wild animals, such as the lion, you can tell by the\r\nexpression of the beast's face and by its actions whether it is in\r\na good temper or not.... The truth is, the polar bear is a most\r\nawkward beast to train. In the first place its character is\r\ndifficult to understand. He is by nature very suspicious, and\r\nwithout the least warning is apt to turn upon his trainer. Among\r\nthe seventy bears that have been taught to do tricks, _only\r\ntwo_ of them are really fond of their work.\"\r\n\r\nIn the end, Mr. William Hagenbeck was very nearly killed by one of\r\nthese polar bears. I was with Carl Hagenbeck a few hours after he\r\nreceived telegraphic news of the tragedy, and his bitterness\r\nagainst those polar bears was boundless. I understood that Monk,\r\nthe wrestling bear, was the assailant,--which was small cause for\r\nwonder. When I saw Mr. Hagenbeck's polar bear show, it gave me\r\nshivers of fear. The first two big male polars that we installed\r\nat our Park came from that very group, and one of them led us into\r\na dreadful tragedy, with a female bear as the victim.\r\n\r\nThe So-Called \"Trick\" Performances. Some psychologists make light\r\nof what they call \"trick performances,\" in which the performing\r\nanimals are guided by signs, or signals, or spoken commands from\r\ntheir trainers. I have never been able to account for this. It is\r\nincontestably true that dull and stupid animals can learn little,\r\nand perform less. For example, all the training in the world could\r\nnot suffice to put a pig through a performance that a chimpanzee\r\nor orang could master in two weeks. The reason is that the pig has\r\nnot the brain power that is indispensable. A woodchuck never could\r\nbecome the mental equal of a wood rat (_Neotoma_). A sheep\r\ncould not hope to rival a horse, either in training or in\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nReally, _the brain, the memory and reason must enter into every\r\nanimal performance that amounts to anything worth while._ It is\r\njust as sensible to flout soldiers on the drill-ground as to wave\r\naside as of no account a troup of trained lions or sea-lions on\r\nthe stage. Any animal that can be taught to perform difficult\r\nfeats, and that delivers the goods in the blinding glare and riot\r\nof the circus ring or the stage footlights, is entitled to my\r\nprofound respect for its powers of mind and nerve.\r\n\r\nThe Sea-Lion's Repertoire. Long ago trainers recognized in the\r\nCalifornia sea-lion (_Zalophus_) a good subject for the ring\r\nand stage. Its long, supple neck, its lithe body and brilliant\r\nnervous energy seemed good for difficult acts. The sea-lion takes\r\nvery kindly to training, and really delights in its performances.\r\nIn fact, it enters into its performance with a keen vigor and zest\r\nthat is pleasing to behold. Let this veracious record of a\r\nperformance of Treat's five sea-lions and two harbor seals, that I\r\nwitnessed October 15, 1910, tell the whole story, in order that\r\nthe reader may judge for himself:\r\n\r\n1. Each sea-lion balanced upright on its nose a wooden staff 3\r\nfeet long, with a round knob on its upper end.\r\n\r\n2. Each sea-lion caught in its mouth a three-foot stick with a\r\nball on each end, tossed it up, whirled it in the air, and caught\r\nit again. This was repeated, without a miss.\r\n\r\n3. Each sea-lion balanced on the tip of its nose, first a ball\r\nlike a baseball, then a large ball two feet in diameter.\r\n\r\n4. Each sea-lion climbed a double ladder of eight steps, and went\r\ndown on the other side, _balancing a large ball on the end of\r\nits nose, without a miss._\r\n\r\n5. The trainer handed a ball to the sea-lion nearest him, who\r\nbalanced it on his nose, walked with it to his box and climbed up.\r\n\r\n6. Then another sea-lion walked over to him, and waited\r\nexpectantly until sea-lion No. 1 tossed the ball to No. 2, who\r\ncaught it on his nose, walked over to his box, climbed up, and\r\npresently tossed it to No. 3.\r\n\r\n7. A silk hat was balanced on its rim.\r\n\r\n8. A seal carrying a balanced ball scrambled upon a cylindrical\r\nbasket and rolled it across the arena, after which other seals\r\nrepeated the performance.\r\n\r\n9. In the last act a flaming torch was balanced, tossed about,\r\ncaught and whirled, and finally returned to the trainer, still\r\nblazing.\r\n\r\nTrained Horses. By carefully selecting the brightest and most\r\nintelligent horses that can be found, it is possible for a trainer\r\nto bring together and educate a group that will go through a fine\r\nperformance in public. However, some exhibitions of trained\r\nhorses are halting, ragged and poor. I have seen only one that\r\nstands out in my records as superlatively fine,--for horses. That\r\nwas known to the public when I saw it as Bartholomew's \"Equine\r\nParadox,\" and it contained twelve wonderfully trained horses. My\r\nrecord of this fine performance fills seven pages of a good-sized\r\nnotebook. While it is too long to reproduce here entire, it can at\r\nleast be briefly described. The trainer called his group a\r\n\"school,\" and of it he said:\r\n\r\n\"While I do not say that any one horse knows the meaning of from\r\n300 to 400 words, I claim that _as a whole_ the school does\r\nknow that number.\"\r\n\r\nThe performance was fairly bewildering; but by diligent work I\r\nrecorded the whole of it. Various horses did various things. They\r\nfetched chairs, papers, hats and coats; opened desks, rang bells,\r\ncame when called, bowed, knelt, and erased figures from a\r\nblackboard. They danced a waltz, a clog dance, a figure-8; they\r\nmarched, halted, paced, trotted, galloped, backed, jumped, leaped\r\nover each other, performed with a barrel, a see-saw and a double\r\nsee-saw. Their marching and drilling would have been creditable to\r\na platoon of rookies.\r\n\r\nIn performing, every horse is handicapped by his lack of hands and\r\nplant grade feet; and the horse memory is not very sure or\r\ncertain. More than any other animal, the horse depends upon the\r\ntrainer's command, and in poor performances the command often\r\nrequires to be repeated, two or three times, or more. The memory\r\nof the horse is not nearly so quick nor so certain as that of the\r\nchimpanzee or elephant.\r\n\r\nDr. Martin J. Potter, of New York, famous trainer of stage and\r\nmovie animals, states that of all animals, wild or domestic, the\r\nhorse is the most intelligent; but I doubt whether he ever trained\r\nany chimpanzees. Speaking from out of the abundance of his\r\ntraining experience with many species of animals except the great\r\napes, Dr. Potter says that \"the seal [i. e. California sea-lion]\r\nlearns its stage cues more easily than any other mute performer.\r\nThe horse, however, is the most intelligent of all animals in its\r\ngrasp and understanding of the work it has learned to perform, and\r\nin its reliable faithfulness and memory.\" Dr. Potter holds that\r\nof wild animals the tiger, owing to its treachery and ferocity, is\r\nthe most difficult wild animal to train; the lion is the most\r\nreliable, and the most stupid of all animals is the pig.\r\n\r\nThe Taming of Boma. A keeper for a short time in our place, named\r\nD'Osta, once did a very neat piece of work in taming a savage and\r\nintractable chimpanzee. When Boma came to us, fresh from the\r\nFrench Congo, he was savage and afraid. He retreated to the\r\nhighest resting-place of his cage, came down only at night for his\r\nmeals, and would make no compromise. We believed that he had been\r\nfearfully abused by his former owners, and through mistreatment\r\nhad acquired both fear and hatred of all men.\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of several months with Boma on that basis, the\r\nsituation grew tiresome and intolerable. So D'Osta said:\r\n\r\n\"I must tame that animal, and teach him not to be afraid of us.\"\r\n\r\nHe introduced a roomy shifting cage into Boma's compartment,\r\nfixed the drop door, and for many days served Boma's food and\r\nwater in that cage only. For two weeks the ape eluded capture, but\r\neventually the keeper caught him. At first Boma's rage and fear\r\nwere boundless; but presently the idea dawned upon his mind that\r\nhe was not to be killed immediately. D'Osta handed him excellent\r\nfood and water, twice a day, spoke to him soothingly, and\r\notherwise let him alone. Slowly Boma's manner changed. He learned\r\nthat he was not to be hurt, nor even annoyed. Confidence in the\r\nmen about him began to come to him. His first signs of\r\nfriendliness were promptly met and cultivated.\r\n\r\nAt the end of ten days, D'Osta opened the sliding door, and Boma\r\nwalked out, a wiser and better ape. His bad temper and his fears\r\nwere gone. He trusted his keeper, and cheerfully obeyed him.\r\nStrangest of all, he even suffered D'Osta to put a collar upon\r\nhim, and chain him to the front bars to curb his too great\r\nplayfulness while his cage was being cleaned.\r\n\r\nBoma's fear of man has never returned. Now, although he is big and\r\ndangerous, he is a perfectly normal ape.\r\n\r\nThe Training of an Over-Age Bear. A bear-trainer-athlete and\r\n\"bear-wrestler\" named Jacob Glass once taught me a lesson that\r\nastounded me. It related to the training of a bear that I thought\r\nwas too old to be trained.\r\n\r\nWe had an Alaskan cinnamon bear, three years old, that had been\r\nchristened \"Christian,\" at Skagway, because it stood so much\r\npestering without flying into rages, as the grizzly did. After a\r\nshort time with us, the concrete floors of our bear dens reacted\r\nupon the soles of its feet so strangely and so seriously that we\r\nwere forced to transfer the animal to a temporary cage that had a\r\nwooden floor. While I was wondering what to do with that bear,\r\nalong came Mr. Glass, anxious and unhappy.\r\n\r\n\"My wrestling bear has died on me,\" he said, \"and I've got to get\r\nanother. You have got one that I would like to buy from you. It's\r\nthe one you call Christian.\"\r\n\r\nVery kindly I said, \"That is a mighty fine bear, as to temper; but\r\nnow he is entirely too old to train, and you couldn't do anything\r\nwith him. He would be a loss to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've looked him over, and I like his looks. I think I can train\r\nhim all right. You let me have him, and I'll make a fine performer\r\nof him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that you never can do it; but you may try him, and send\r\nhim back when you fail.\"\r\n\r\nThus ended the first lesson; and I was sure that in a month Mr.\r\nGlass would beg me to take back the untrainable animal.\r\n\r\nAbout one year later Glass appeared again, jubilant. At once he\r\nbroke forth into eulogies of Christian; but one chapter would not\r\nbe large enough to contain them. He had trained that bear, with\r\noutrageous ease and celerity, and hadimmediately taken him upon\r\nthe stage as a professional jiu-jitsu wrestler. And really, the\r\nact was admirable. As a wrestler, the bear seemed almost as\r\nintelligent as the man. He knew the \"left-hand half-nelson\" as well\r\nas Glass, and he knew the following words, perfectly: \"Right,\r\nleft, half-nelson, strangle, head up, nose under arm, and\r\nhammer-lock.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration with caption: THE WRESTLING BEAR \"CHRISTIAN\" AND HIS\r\nPARTNER]\r\n\r\nGlass declared that this bear was more intelligent than any lion,\r\nor any other trained animal ever seen by him. He was wise in many\r\nways besides wrestling,--in his friendship with Glass, with other\r\nbears, with other men, and with a dog. _He obeyed all orders\r\nwillingly,_ even permitting Glass to take his food away when he\r\nwas eating; but he would not stand being punished with a whip or\r\na stick! In response to that he would bite. However, he generously\r\npermitted himself to be _held down and choked, as a\r\npunishment,_ after which he would be very repentant, and would\r\ninsist upon getting into his partner's lap,--to show his good\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nGlass was enthusiastically certain that Christian could reason\r\nindependently from cause to effect. He declared that his alertness\r\nof mind was so pronounced it was very rarely necessary to show him\r\na second time how to do a given thing.\r\n\r\nTraining an Adult Savage Monkey. Once we had a number of Japanese\r\nred-faced monkeys, and one of the surplus adult males had a temper\r\nas red as his face. Mr. Wormwood, an exhibitor of performing\r\nmonkeys, wished to buy that animal; but I declined to sell it, on\r\nthe ground that it would be impossible to train it.\r\n\r\nAt that implied challenge the trainer perked up and insisted upon\r\nhaving that particular bad animal; so we yielded. He wished him\r\nfor the special business of turning somersaults, because he had no\r\ntail to interfere with that performance.\r\n\r\nTwo months later Mr. Wormwood appeared again. \"Yes,\" he said, but\r\nnot boastfully, \"_I trained him;_ but I came mighty near to\r\ngiving him up as a bad job. He was the hardest subject I ever\r\ntackled; but I conquered him at last, and now he is working all\r\nright.\"\r\n\r\nA really great number of different kinds of animals have been\r\ntrained for stage performances, running the scale all the way up\r\nfrom fleas to elephants. It is easy to recall mice, rats, rabbits,\r\nsquirrels, parrots, macaws, cockatoos, crows, chickens, geese,\r\ncats, pigs, dogs, monkeys, baboons, apes, bears, seals, sea-lions,\r\nwalruses, kangaroos, horses, hippopotami and elephants. It is a\r\nlarge subject, and its many details are full of interest. It is\r\nimpossible to discuss here all these species and breeds.\r\n\r\nIn concluding these notes I leave off as I began,--with the\r\nstatement that any student of animal psychology who for any reason\r\nwhatever ignores or undervalues the intelligence of trained\r\nanimals puts a handicap upon himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE HIGHER PASSIONS\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE MORALS OF WILD ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ethics and morals of men and animals are thoroughly\r\ncomparative, and it is only by direct comparisons that they can be\r\nanalyzed and classified. It is quite possible that there are quite\r\na number of intelligent men and women who are not yet aware of the\r\nfact that wild animals _have_ moral codes, and that on an\r\naverage they live up to them better than men do to theirs.\r\n\r\nIt is a painful operation to expose the grinning skeletons in the\r\nclosets of the human family, but in no other way is it possible\r\nto hold a mirror up to nature. With all our brightness and all our\r\ntalents,--real and imitation,--few men ever stop to ask what our\r\nhorses, dogs and cats think of our follies and our wickedness.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the year 1921 the annual total of human wickedness\r\nhad reached staggering proportions. From August 1914 to November\r\n1918 the moral standing of the human race reached the lowest depth\r\nit ever sounded since the days of the cave-dwellers. This we know\r\nto be true, because of the increase in man's capacity for\r\nwickedness, and its crop of results. After what we recently have\r\nseen in Europe and Asia, and on the high seas, let no man speak of\r\na monster in human form as \"a brute;\" for so far as moral standing\r\nis concerned, some of the animals allegedly \"below man\" now are in\r\na position to look down upon him.\r\n\r\nIt is a cold and horrid fact that today, all around us, and\r\nsometimes close at hand, men are committing a long list of\r\nrevolting crimes such as even the most debased and cruel beasts of\r\nthe field _never_ commit. I refer to wanton wholesale murder,\r\noften with torture; assault with violence, robbery in a hundred\r\ncruel forms, and a dozen unmentionable crimes invented by\r\ndegenerate man and widely practiced. If anyone feels that this\r\nindictment is too strong, I can cite a few titles that will be\r\nquite sufficient for my case.\r\n\r\nLet us make a few comparisons between the human species (_Homo\r\nsapiens_) and the so-called \"lower\" wild animals; and let it be\r\nunderstood that the author testifies, in courtroom phrase, only\r\n\"to the best of his information and belief.\"\r\n\r\nOnly two wild animal species known to me,--wolves and crocodiles,\r\n--devour their own kind; but many of the races of men have been\r\ncannibals, and some are so today.\r\n\r\nAmong free wild animals, the cruel abuse or murder of children by\r\ntheir parents, or by other adults of the tribe, is unknown; but in\r\nall the \"civilized\" races of men infanticide and child murder are\r\nfrightfully common crimes. In 1921 a six-year-old Eskimo girl,\r\nwhose father and mother had been murdered, was strangled by her\r\nrelatives, because she had no visible means of support.\r\n\r\nThe murder of the aged and helpless among wild animals is almost\r\nunknown; but among both the savage and the civilized races of men\r\nit is quite common. Our old acquaintance, Shack-Nasty Jim, the\r\nModoc Indian, tomahawked his own mother because she hindered his\r\nprogress; but many persons in and around New York have done worse\r\nthan that.\r\n\r\nCivil war between the members of a wild animal species is a thing\r\nunknown in the annals of wild-animal history; but among men it is\r\nan every-day occurrence.\r\n\r\nAmong _free_ animals it is against the moral and ethical\r\ncodes of all species of vertebrates for the strong to bully and\r\noppress the weak; but it is almost everywhere a common rule of\r\naction with about ten per cent of the human race.\r\n\r\nThe members of a wild animal species are in honor bound not to rob\r\none another, but with 25 per cent of the men of all civilized\r\nraces, robbery, and the desire to get something for nothing, are\r\nruling passions. No wild animals thus far known and described\r\npractice sex crimes; but the less said of the races of men on this\r\nsubject, the better for our feelings.\r\n\r\nAmong animals, save in the warfare of carnivorous animals for\r\ntheir daily food, there are no exterminatory wars between species,\r\nand even local wars over territory are of very rare occurrence.\r\nAmong men, the territorial wars of tribes and nations are\r\ninnumerable, they have been from the earliest historic times, and\r\nthey are certain to continue as long as this earth is inhabited by\r\nman. The \"end of war\" between the grasping nations of this earth\r\nis an iridescent dream, because of the inextinguishable jealousy\r\nand meanness of nations; but it is well to reduce them to a\r\nminimum. Nations like Germany, Bulgaria, Turkey and Russia will\r\nnever stand hitched for any long periods. Their peace-loving\r\nneighbors need to keep their weapons well oiled and polished, and\r\nindulge in no hallucinations of a millenium upon this wicked\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nIn the mating season, there is fighting in many wild animal\r\nspecies between the largest and finest male individuals for the\r\nhonor of overlordship in increasing and diffusing the species.\r\nThese encounters are most noticeable in the various species of the\r\ndeer family, because the fatal interlocking of antlers\r\noccasionally causes the death of both contestants. We have in our\r\nNational Collection of Heads and Horns sets of interlocked antlers\r\nof moose, caribou, mule deer and white-tailed deer.\r\n\r\nOtherwise than from the accidental interlocking of antlers,--due\r\nto the fact that an animal can push forward with far greater force\r\nthan it can pull back,--I have never seen, heard or read of a wild\r\nanimal having been _killed_ outright in a fight over the\r\npossession of females. Fur seal and Stellar sea-lion bulls, and\r\nbig male orang-utans, frequently are found badly scarified by\r\nwounds received in fighting during the breeding season, but of\r\nactual deaths we have not heard.\r\n\r\nThe first law of the jungle is: \"Live, and let live.\"\r\n\r\nLeaving out of account the carnivorous animals who must kill or\r\ndie, _all the wild vertebrate species of the earth have learned\r\nthe logic that peace promotes happiness, prosperity and long\r\nlife._ This fundamentally useful knowledge governs not only the\r\nwild animal individual, but also the tribe, the species, and\r\ncontiguous species.\r\n\r\nDo the brown bears and grizzlies of Alaska wage war upon each\r\nother, species against species? By no means. It seems reasonably\r\ncertain that those species occasionally intermarry. Do the big\r\nsea-lions and the walruses seek to drive away or exterminate the\r\nneighboring fur seals or the helpless hair seals? Such warfare is\r\nabsolutely unknown. Do the moose and caribou of Alaska and Yukon\r\nTerritory attack the mountain sheep and goats? Never. Does the\r\nIndian elephant attack the gaur, the sambar, the axis deer or the\r\nmuntjac? The idea is preposterous. Does any species of giraffe,\r\nzebra, antelope or buffalo attack any other species on the same\r\ncrowded plains of British East Africa? If so, we have yet to learn\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nIf the races and nations of men were as peace-loving, honest and\r\nsensible in avoiding wars as all the wild animal species are, then\r\nwould we indeed have a social heaven upon earth.\r\n\r\nNow, tell me, ye winged winds that blow from the four corners of\r\nthe earth and over the seven seas, whence came the Philosophy of\r\nPeace to the world's wild animals? Did they learn it by observing\r\nthe ways of man? \"It is to laugh,\" says the innkeeper. Man has not\r\nyet learned it himself; and therefore do we find the beasts of\r\nthe field a lap ahead of the quarrelsome biped who has assumed\r\ndominion over them.\r\n\r\nDay by day we read in our newspapers of men and women who are\r\nmoral lepers and utterly unfit to associate with horses, dogs,\r\ncats, deer and elephants. Our big male chimpanzee, Father Boma,\r\nwho knows no wife but Suzette, and firmly repels the blandishments\r\nof his neighbor Fanny, is a more moral individual than many a\r\npretty gentleman whose name we see heading columns of divorce\r\nproceedings in the newspapers.\r\n\r\nSaid the Count to Julia in \"The Hunchback,\" \"Dost thou like the\r\npicture, dearest?\" As a natural historian, it is our task to hew\r\nto the line, and let the chips fall where they will.\r\n\r\nAmong the wild animals there are but few degenerate and unmoral\r\nspecies. In some very upright species there are occasionally\r\nindividual lapses from virtue. A famous case in point is the rogue\r\nelephant, who goes from meanness to meanness until he becomes\r\nunbearable. Then he is driven out of the herd; he becomes an\r\noutcast and a bandit, and he upsets carts, maims bullocks, tears\r\ndown huts and finally murders natives until the nearest local\r\nsahib gets after him, and ends his career with a bullet through\r\nhis wicked brain.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the gray wolf of North America (like his congener in\r\nthe Old World) is the most degenerate and unmoral mammal species\r\non earth. He murders his wounded packmates, he is a greedy\r\ncannibal, he will attack his wife and chew her unmercifully. On\r\nthe other hand, his one redeeming trait is that he helps to rear\r\nthe pups,--when they are successfully defended from him by their\r\nmother!\r\n\r\nThe wolverine makes a specialty of devilish and uncanny cunning\r\nand energy in destroying the property of man. Trappers have told\r\nus that when a wolverine invades a trapper's cabin in his absence,\r\nhe destroys very nearly its entire contents. The food that he can\r\nneither eat nor carry away he defiles in such a manner that the\r\nhungriest man is unable to eat it. This seems to be a trait of\r\nthis species only,--among wild animals; but during the recent war\r\nit was asserted that similar acts were committed by soldiers in\r\nthe captured and occupied villas of northern France.\r\n\r\nThe domestication of the dog has developed a new type of animal\r\ncriminal. The sheep-killing dog is in a class by himself. The wild\r\ndog hunts in the broad light of day, often running down game by\r\nthe relay system. The sheep-killing dog is a cunning night\r\nassassin, a deceiver of his master, a shrewd hider of criminal\r\nevidence, a sanctimonious hypocrite by day but a bloody-minded\r\nmurderer under cover of darkness. Sometimes his cunning is almost\r\nbeyond belief. Now, can anyone tell us how much of this particular\r\nevolution is due to the influence of Man upon Dog through a\r\nhundred generations of captivity and association? Has the dog\r\nlearned from man the science of moral banditry, the best methods\r\nfor the concealment of evidence, and how to dissemble?\r\n\r\nElsewhere a chapter is devoted to the crimes of wild animals; but\r\nthe great majority of the cases cited were found among _captive_\r\nanimals, where abnormal conditions produced exceptional results.\r\nThe crimes of captive animals are many, but the crimes of free wild\r\nanimals are comparatively few. Whenever we disturb the delicate\r\nand precise balance of nature we may expect abnormal results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nTHE LAWS OF THE FLOCKS AND THE HERDS\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough a thousand generations of breeding and living under\r\nnatural conditions, and of self-maintenance against enemies and\r\nevil conditions, the wild flocks and herds of beasts and birds\r\nhave evolved a short code of community laws that make for their\r\nown continued existence.\r\n\r\nAnd they do more than that. When free from the evil influences of\r\nman, those flock-and-herd laws promote, and actually produce,\r\npeace, prosperity and happiness. This is no fantastic theory of\r\nthe friends of animals. It is a fact, just as evident to the\r\nthinking mind as the presence of the sun at high noon.\r\n\r\nThe first wild birds and quadrupeds found themselves beset by\r\nclimatic conditions of various degrees and kinds of rigor and\r\ndestructive power. In the torrid zone it took the form of\r\nexcessive rain and humidity, excessive heat, or excessive dryness\r\nand aridity. In the temperate and frigid zones, life was a\r\nseasonal battle with bitter cold, torrents of cold rain in early\r\nwinter or spring, devastating sleet, and deep snow and ice that\r\nleft no room for argument.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the species that were not predatory found\r\nthemselves surrounded by fangs and claws, and the never-ending\r\nhunger of their owners. The air, the earth and the waters swarmed\r\nwith predatory animals, great and small, ever seeking for the\r\nherbivorous and traitorous species, and preferably those that\r\nwere least able to fight or to flee. The La Brea fossil beds at\r\nLos Angeles, wherein a hospitable lake of warm asphalt conserved\r\nskeletal remains of vertebrates to an extent and perfection quite\r\nunparalleled, have revealed some very remarkable conditions. The\r\nenormous output, up to date, of skulls of huge lions, wolves,\r\nsabre-toothed tigers, bears and other predatory animals, shows,\r\nfor once, just what the camels, llamas, deer, bison and mammoths\r\nof those days had to do, to be, and to suffer in order to survive.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of a little serious study, it is by no means\r\ndifficult to recognize the hard laws that have enabled the\r\nelephant, bison, sheep, goats, deer, antelope, gazelles, fur-seal,\r\nwalrus and others to survive and increase. From the wild animal\r\nherds and bird flocks that we have seen and personally known,\r\n_we know what their laws are,_ and can set them down in the\r\norder of their evolution and importance.\r\n\r\nThe First Law. _There shall be no fighting in the family, the\r\nherd or the species, at any other time than in the mating season;\r\nand then only between adult males who fight for herd\r\nleadership._\r\n\r\nThe destructiveness of intertribal warfare, either organized or\r\ndesultory, must have been recognized in Jurassic times, millions\r\nof years ago, by the reptiles of that period. Throughout the\r\nanimal kingdom below man the blessings of peace now are thoroughly\r\nknown. This first law is obeyed by all species save man. We doubt\r\nwhether all the testimony of the rocks added together can show\r\nthat one wild species of vertebrate life ever really was\r\nexterminated by another species, not even excepting the predatory\r\nspecies which lived by killing.\r\n\r\nNo one (so far as we know) has charged that the lions, or the\r\ntigers, the bears, the orcas, the eagles or the owls have ever\r\nobliterated a species during historic times. It was the swine of\r\ncivilization, transplanted by human agencies, that exterminated\r\nthe dodo on the Island of Mauritius; and it was men, not birds of\r\nprey, who swept off the earth the great auk, the passenger pigeon\r\nand a dozen other bird species.\r\n\r\nThe Second Law. _The strong members of a flock or herd shall not\r\nbully nor oppress the weak._\r\n\r\nThis law, constantly broken by degenerate and vicious men, women\r\nand children, very rarely is broken in a free wild herd or flock.\r\nIn the observance of this fundamental law, born of ethics and\r\nexpediency, mankind is far behind the wild animals. It would serve\r\na good purpose if the criminologists and the alienists would\r\nfigure out the approximate proportion of the human species now\r\nliving that bullies and maltreats and oppresses the weak and the\r\ndefenseless. At this moment \"society\" in the United States is in a\r\nstate of thoroughly imbecilic defenselessness against the new\r\ntype of predatory savages known as \"bandits.\"\r\n\r\nThe Third Law. _During the annual period of motherhood, both\r\nprospective and actual, mothers must be held safe from all forms\r\nof molestation; and their young shall in no manner be interfered\r\nwith._\r\n\r\nFor the perpetuation of a family, a clan or a species, the\r\nprotection of the mothers, and their weak and helpless offspring\r\nis a necessity recognized by even the dullest vertebrate animals.\r\nAs birth-time or nesting-time approaches the wild flocks and herds\r\nuniversally permit the potential mothers to seek seclusion, and to\r\nwork out their respective problems according to their own judgment\r\nand the means at their command. The coming mother looks for a spot\r\nthat will afford (1) a secure hiding-place, (2) the best\r\navailable shelter from inclement weather, (3) accessible food and\r\nwater, and (4) cover or other protection for her young.\r\n\r\nDuring this period the males often herd together, and they serve a\r\nprotective function by attracting to themselves the attacks of\r\ntheir enemies. For the mothers, the bearing time is a truce time.\r\nThere are fox-hunters who roundly assert that in spring fox hounds\r\nhave been known to refuse to attack and kill foxes about to become\r\nmothers.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Law. _In union there is strength; in separation\r\nthere is weakness; and the solitary animal is in the greatest\r\ndanger._\r\n\r\nIt was the wild species of mammals and birds who learned and most\r\ndiligently observed this law who became individually the most\r\nnumerous. A hundred pairs of eyes, a hundred noses and a hundred\r\npairs of listening ears increase about ten times the protection of\r\nthe single individual against surprise attacks. The solitary\r\nelephant, bison, sheep or goat is far easier to stalk and approach\r\nthan a herd, or a herd member. A wolf pack can attack and kill\r\neven the strongest solitary musk-ox, bison or caribou, but the\r\nhorned herd is invincible. A lynx can pull down and kill a single\r\nmountain sheep ram, but even the mountain lion does not care to\r\nattack a herd of sheep. It is due solely to the beneficent results\r\nof this clear precept, and the law of defensive union, that any\r\nbaboons are today alive in Africa.\r\n\r\nThe grizzly bear loves mountain-goat meat; but he does not love to\r\nhave his inner tube punctured by the deadly little black skewers\r\non the head of a billy. It is the Mountain Goats' Protective Union\r\nthat condemns the silvertip grizzly to laborious digging for\r\nhumble little ground-squirrels, instead of killing goats for a\r\nliving. The rogue elephant who will not behave himself in the\r\nherd, and will not live up to the herd law, is expelled; and after\r\nthat takes place his wicked race is very soon ended by a high-\r\npower bullet, about calibre .26. The last one brought to my notice\r\nwas overtaken by Charles Theobald, State Shikaree of Mysore, in a\r\nFord automobile; and the car outlived the elephant.\r\n\r\nThe Fifth Law. _Absolute obedience to herd leaders and parents\r\nis essential to the safety of the herd and of the individual; and\r\nthis obedience must be prompt and thorough._\r\n\r\nWhenever the affairs of grown men and women are dominated by\r\nignorant, inexperienced and rash juniors, look out for trouble;\r\nfor as surely as the sun continues to shine, it will come. With an\r\nacquaintance that comprehends many species of wild quadrupeds and\r\nbirds, I do not recall even one herd or flock that I have seen led\r\nby its young members. There are no young spendthrifts among the\r\nwild animals. For them, youthful folly is too expensive to be\r\ntolerated. The older members of the clan are responsible for its\r\nsafety, and therefore do they demand obedience to their orders.\r\nThey have their commands, and they have a sign language by which\r\nthey convey them in terms that are silent but unmistakable. They\r\norder \"Halt,\" and the herd stops, at once. At the command\r\n\"Attention,\" each herd member \"freezes\" where he stands, and\r\nintently looks, listens and scents the air. At the order \"Feed at\r\nwill,\" the tension slowly relaxes; but if the order is \"Fly!\" the\r\nwhole herd is off in a body, as if propelled by one mind and one\r\npower.\r\n\r\nMy first knowledge of this law of the flock came down to me from\r\nthe blue ether when I first saw, in my boyhood, a V-shaped flock\r\nof Canada geese cleaving the sky with straight and steady flight,\r\nand perfect alignment. Even in my boyish mind I realized that the\r\nwell-ordered progress of the wild geese was in obedience to\r\nIntelligence and Flock Law. Later on, I saw on the Jersey sands\r\nthe mechanical sweeps and curves and doubles of flying flocks of\r\nsandpipers and sanderlings, as absolutely perfect in obedience to\r\ntheir leaders as the slats of a Venetian blind.\r\n\r\nA herd of about thirty elephants, under the influence of a still\r\nalarm and sign signals, once vanished from the brush in front of\r\nme so quickly and so silently that it seemed uncanny. One single\r\nnote of command from a gibbon troop leader is sufficient to set\r\nthe whole company in instant motion, fleeing at speed and in good\r\norder, with not a sound save the swish of the small branches that\r\nserve as the rungs of their ladder of flight.\r\n\r\nIn the actual practice of herd leadership in species of ruminant\r\nanimals, the largest and most spectacular bull elk or bison is not\r\nalways the leader. Frequently it has been observed that a wise old\r\ncow is the actual leader and director of the herd, and that \"what\r\nshe says, goes.\" This was particularly remarked to me by James\r\nMcNaney during the course of our \"last buffalo hunt\" in Montana,\r\nin 1886. From 1880 to 1884 he had been a mighty buffalo-hunter,\r\nfor hides. He stated that whenever as a still-hunter he got \"a\r\nstand on a bunch,\" and began to shoot, slowly and patiently, so as\r\nnot to alarm the stand, whenever a buffalo took alarm and\r\nattempted to lead away the bunch, usually it proved to be a wise\r\nold cow. The bulls seemed too careless to take notice of the\r\nfiring and try to lead away from it.\r\n\r\nThe Sixth Law. _Of food and territory, the weak shall have their\r\nshare._\r\n\r\nWhile this law is binding upon all the members of a wild flock, a\r\nherd, a clan or a species, outside of species limits it may become\r\nnull and void; though in actual practice I think that this rarely\r\noccurs. Among the hoofed animals; the seals and sea-lions; the\r\napes, baboons and monkeys, and the kangaroos, the food that is\r\navailable to a herd is common to all its members. We can not\r\nrecall an instance of a species attempting to dispossess and\r\nevict another species, though it must be that many such have\r\noccurred. In the game-laden plains of eastern Africa, half a dozen\r\nspecies, such as kongonis, sable antelopes, gazelles and zebras,\r\noften have been observed in one landscape, with no fighting\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nWith all but the predatory wild animals and man, the prevailing\r\ndisposition is to _live, and let live._ One of the few\r\nrecorded murders of young animals by an old one of the same\r\nspecies concerned the wanton killing of two polar bear cubs in\r\nnorthern Franz Joseph Land, as observed by Nansen.\r\n\r\nThe Seventh Law. _Man is the deadliest enemy of all the wild\r\ncreatures; and the instant a man appears the whole herd must fly\r\nfrom him, fast and far._\r\n\r\nIn some of the regions to which man and his death-dealing\r\ninfluence have not penetrated, this law is not yet on the statute\r\nbooks of the jungle and the wilderness. Sir Ernest Shackleton and\r\nCaptain Scott found it unknown to the giant penguins and sea\r\nleopards of the Antarctic Continent, I have seen a few flocks and\r\nherds by whom the law was either unknown or forgotten; but the\r\ntotal number is a small one. There was a herd of mountain sheep on\r\nPinacate Peak, a big flock of sage grouse in Montana, various\r\nflocks of ptarmigan on the summits of the Elk River Mountains,\r\nBritish Columbia,--and out of a long list of occurrences that is\r\nall I will now recall.\r\n\r\nIt is fairly common for the members of a vast assemblage of\r\nanimals, like the bison, barren-ground caribou, fur seal, and sea\r\nbirds on their nesting cliffs, to assume such security from their\r\nnumbers as to ignore man; and all such cases are highly\r\ninteresting manifestations of the influence of the fourth law when\r\ncarried out to six decimal places.\r\n\r\nThe Eighth and Last Law. _Whenever in a given spot all men cease\r\nto kill us, there may we accept sanctuary and dwell in peace._\r\n\r\nThis law comes as Amendment 1 to the original Constitution of the\r\nAnimal Kingdom. The quick intelligence of wild animals in\r\nrecognizing a new sanctuary, and in adopting it unreservedly and\r\nthankfully as their own territory, is to all friends of wild life\r\na source of wonder and delight. With their own eyes Americans have\r\nseen the effects of sanctuary-making upon bison, elk, mule deer,\r\nwhite-tailed deer, mountain sheep, mountain goat, prong-horned\r\nantelope, grizzly and black bears, beavers, squirrels, chipmunks,\r\nrabbits, sage grouse, quail, wild ducks and geese, swans, pelicans\r\nbrown and white, and literally hundreds of species of smaller\r\nbirds of half a dozen orders.\r\n\r\nIn view of this magnificent and continent-wide manifestation of\r\ndiscovery, new thought and original conclusion, let no man tell us\r\nthat the wild birds and quadrupeds \"do not think\" and \"can not\r\nreason.\"\r\n\r\nThe Exceptions of Captivity. When wild animals come into\r\ncaptivity, a few individuals develop and reveal their worst traits\r\nof character, and much latent wickedness comes to the surface. A\r\nsmall percentage of individuals become mean and lawless, and a\r\nstill smaller number show criminal instincts. These Bolshevistic\r\nindividuals commit misdemeanors and crimes such as are unknown in\r\nthe wild state. One male ruminant out of perhaps fifty will turn\r\nmurderer, and kill a female or a fawn, entirely contrary to the\r\nherd law; and at long intervals a male predatory animal kills his\r\nmate or young.\r\n\r\nOccasionally captivity warps wild animal or wild bird character\r\nquite out of shape, though it is a satisfaction to know that the\r\ntotal proportion of those so affected is very small. Long and\r\nclose confinement in a prison-like home, filled with more daily\r\ncares and worries than any animal cage has of iron bars, has sent\r\nmany a human wife and mother to an insane asylum; but the super-\r\nhumanitarians who rail out at the existence of zoological parks\r\nand zoos are troubled by that not at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nPLAYS AND PASTIMES OF ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nI approach this subject with a\r\nfeeling of satisfaction; but I would not like to state the\r\nnumber of hours that I have spent in watching the play of our\r\nwild animals.\r\n\r\nOut in the wilds, where the bears, sheep and goats live and\r\nthrive, the outdoorsmen see comparatively few wild animals at\r\nplay. No matter what the season, the dangers of the wilderness and\r\nmountain summit remain the same. When kids and lambs are young,\r\nthe eaglets are hungriest, and their mothers are most determined\r\nin their hunting. After September 1, the deadly still-hunters are\r\nout, and strained watchfulness is the unvarying rule, from dawn\r\nuntil dark.\r\n\r\nOut in the wilds, it is the _moving_ animal that instantly\r\ncatches every hostile eye within visual range. A white goat kid\r\nvigorously gamboling on the bare rocks would attract all the\r\ngolden eagles, hunters, trappers and Indians within a radius of\r\ntwo miles. It is the rule that kids, fawns and lambs must _lie\r\nlow and keep still,_ to avoid attracting deadly enemies. On the\r\nbare summits, play can be indulged in only at great risk.\r\nGenerations of persecution have implanted in the brain of the\r\nruminant baby the commanding instinct to fold up its long legs,\r\nneatly and compactly, furl its ears along its neck, and closely\r\nlie for hours against a rock or a log. During daylight hours they\r\nmust literally hug the ground. Silence and inactivity is the first\r\nprice that all young animals in the wilds pay for their lives. It\r\nis only in the safe shelter of captivity, or man-made sanctuaries,\r\nthat they are free to play.\r\n\r\nIn the comfortable security of the \"zoo\" all the wild conditions\r\nare changed. The restraints of fear are off, and every animal is\r\nfree to act as joyous as it feels. Here we see things that men\r\n_never see in the wilds!_ If any Rocky Mountain bear hunter\r\nshould ever see bear cubs or full-grown bears wrestling and\r\ncarrying on as they do here, he would say that they were plumb\r\ncrazy!\r\n\r\nOf all our wild animals, not even excepting the apes and monkeys,\r\nour young bears are the most persistently playful. In fact, I\r\nbelieve that when _properly caged and tended,_ bears under\r\neight years of age are the most joyous and playful of all wild\r\nanimals. We have given our bears smooth and spacious yards floored\r\nwith concrete, with a deep pool in the centre of each, and great\r\npossibilities in climbing upon rocks high and low. The top of each\r\nsleeping den is a spacious balcony with a smooth floor. The\r\nfacilities for bear wrestling and skylarking are perfect, and\r\nthere are no offensive uneven floors nor dead stone walls to annoy\r\nor discourage any bear. They can look at each other through the\r\nentire series of cages and there is no chance whatever for a bear\r\nto feel lonesome. We put just as many individuals into each cage\r\nas we think the traffic will stand; and sometimes as many as six\r\nyoung bears are reared together.\r\n\r\nNow, all these conditions promote good spirits, playfulness, and\r\nthe general enjoyment of life. Any one who thinks that our bears\r\nare not far happier than those that are in the wilds and exposed\r\nto enemies, hunger and cold, should pause and consider.\r\n\r\nOur bear cubs begin to play just as soon as they emerge from their\r\nnatal den, in March or April, and they keep it up until they are\r\nsix or seven years of age,--or longer! Our visitors take the\r\nplayfulness of small cubs as a matter of course, but the clumsy\r\nand ridiculous postures and antics of fat-paunched full-grown\r\nbears are irresistibly funny. Really, there are times when it\r\nseems as if the roars of laughter from the watching crowd\r\nstimulates wrestling bears to further efforts. On October 28,\r\n1921, about seventy boys stood in front of and alongside the\r\nden of two Kluane grizzly cubs and shouted for nearly half an hour\r\nin approval and admiration of the rapid and rough play of those\r\ncubs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration with caption: ADULT BEARS AT PLAY]\r\n\r\nThe play of bears, young or middle-aged, consists in boxing,\r\ncatch-as-catch-can wrestling, and chasing each other to and fro.\r\nCubs begin to spar as soon as they are old enough to stand erect\r\non their hind feet. They take their distance as naturally as\r\nprize-fighters, and they strike, parry and dodge just as men do.\r\nThey handle their front feet with far more dexterity and precision\r\nthan boys six years of age.\r\n\r\nBoxing bears always strike for the head, and bite to seize the\r\ncheek of the opponent. In biting, mouth meets mouth, in defense as\r\nwell as attack. When a biting bear makes a successful pass and\r\nfinally succeeds in getting a firm toothhold on the cheek of his\r\nopponent, the party of the second part promptly throws himself\r\nprone upon the ground, and with four free feet concentrated upon\r\nthe head of the other bear forces him to let go. This movement,\r\nand the four big, flat foot soles coming up into action is, in\r\nlarge bears, a very laughable spectacle, and generally produces a\r\nroar.\r\n\r\nWrestling bears roll over and over on the ground, clawing and\r\nbiting, until one scrambles up, and either makes a new attack or\r\nrushes away.\r\n\r\nBears love to chase one another, _and be chased;_ and in this\r\nform of skylarking they raise a whirlwind of activity which leads\r\nall around the floor, up to the balcony and along the length of\r\nit, and plunges down at the other end. Often a bear that is chased\r\nwill fling himself into the bathing pool, with a tremendous\r\nsplash, quickly scramble out again and rush off anew in a swirl of\r\nflying water.\r\n\r\nThe two big male polar bears that came to us from the William\r\nHagenbeck group were very fond of playing and wrestling in the\r\nwater of their swimming pool. Often they kept up that aquatic\r\nskylarking for two hours at a stretch, and by this constant claw\r\nwork upon each other's pelts they kept their coats of hair so\r\nthinned down that we had to explain them. One bear had a very\r\nspectacular swimming trick. He would swim across the pool until\r\nhis front feet touched the side, then he would throw himself over\r\nbackwards, put his hind feet against the rock wall, and with a\r\nfinal shove send himself floating gracefully on his back across to\r\nthe other side.\r\n\r\nPlayful bears are much given to playing tricks, and teasing each\r\nother. A bear sleeping out in the open den is regarded as a proper\r\nsubject for hectoring, by a sudden bite or cuff, or a general\r\nassault. It is natural to expect that wrestling bears will\r\nfrequently become angry and fight; but such is not the case. This\r\noften happens with boys and men, but bears play the game\r\nconsistently to the end. I can not recall a single instance of a\r\nreal bear fight as the result of a wrestling or boxing match; and\r\nmay all boys take note of this good example from the bear dens.\r\n\r\nNext to the bears, the apes and monkeys are our most playful\r\nanimals. Here, also, it is the young and the half grown members of\r\nthe company that are most active in play. Fully mature animals are\r\ntoo sedate, or too heavy, for the frivolities of youth. A well-\r\nmatched pair of young chimpanzees will wrestle and play longer and\r\nharder than the young of any other primate species known to me. It\r\nis important to cage together only young apes of equal size and\r\nstrength, for if there is any marked disparity in size, the larger\r\nand stronger animal will wear out the strength of its smaller\r\ncage-mate, and impair its health.\r\n\r\nIn playing, young chimps, orangs or monkeys seize each other and\r\nwrestle, fall, and roll over and over, indefinitely. They make\r\ngreat pretenses of biting each other, but it is all make-believe.\r\nMy favorite orang-utan pet in Borneo loved to play at biting me,\r\nbut whenever the pressure became too strong I would say chidingly,\r\n\"Ah! Ah!\" and his jaws would instantly relax. He loved to butt me\r\nin the chest with his head, make wry faces, and make funny noises\r\nwith his lips. I tried to teach him \"cat's cradle\" but it was too\r\nmuch for him. His clumsy fingers could not manage it.\r\n\r\nOne of our brightest chimpanzees, named Baldy, was much given to\r\nhectoring his female cage-mate, for sport. What he regarded as his\r\nbest joke was destroying her bed. Many times over, after she had\r\nlaboriously carried straw up to the balcony, carefully made up a\r\nnice, soft, circular bed for herself, and settled down upon it for\r\na well-earned rest, Baldy would silently climb up to her level,\r\nsuddenly fling himself upon her as she lay, and with all four of\r\nhis arms and legs violently working, the nest would be torn to\r\npieces and scattered and the lady orang rudely pulled about. Then\r\nBaldy would joyously swing down to the lower level, settle himself\r\ndemurely at the front of the cage, and with a placid face and\r\ninnocent, far-away expression in his eyes gaze at the crowd. There\r\nwas nothing lacking but a mischievous wink of one eye.\r\n\r\nWhenever his cage-mate selected a particularly long and perfect\r\nstraw and placed it crosswise in her mouth, Baldy would steal up\r\nbehind her and gleefully snatch it away.\r\n\r\nBaldy was a born comedian. He loved to amuse a crowd and make\r\npeople laugh. He would go through a great trapeze performance of\r\nclownish and absurd gymnastics, and often end it with three or\r\nfour loud smacks of his big black feet against the wall. This was\r\naccomplished by violent kicking backwards. His dancing and up-and-\r\ndown jumping always made visitors laugh, after which he would\r\njoyously give his piercing \"_Wah-hoo_\" shout of triumph. A\r\nSioux Indian squaw dances by jumping up and down, but her\r\nperformance is lifeless in comparison.\r\n\r\nNo vaudeville burlesque dancer ever cut a funnier monkey shine\r\nthan the up-and-down high-jump dance and floor-slapping act of our\r\nBoma chimpanzee (1921). Boma offers this whenever he becomes\r\nespecially desirous of entertaining a party of distinguished\r\nvisitors. In stiff dancing posture, he leaps high in the air,\r\nprecisely like a great black jumping-jack straight from Dante's\r\nInferno. Orangs love to turn somersaults, and some individuals\r\nare so persistent about it as to wear the hair off their backs,\r\ndisfigure their beauty, and disgust their keepers.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on \"Mental Traits of the Gorilla\" a descriptionis\r\ngiven of the play of Major Penny's wonderful John Gorilla.\r\n\r\nWhen many captive monkeys are kept together in one large cage\r\ncontaining gymnastic properties, many species develop humor, and\r\nindulge in play of many kinds. They remind me of a group of well-\r\nfed and boisterous small boys who must skylark or \"bust.\" From\r\nmorning until night they pull each other's tails, wrestle and\r\nroll, steal each other's playthings, and wildly chase each other\r\nto and fro. There is no end of chattering, and screeching, and\r\nfunny facial grimaces. A writer in _Life_ once said that the\r\nsexes of monkeys can be distinguished by the fact that \"the\r\nfemales chatter twice as fast as the males,\" but I am sure that\r\nmany ladies will dispute that statement.\r\n\r\nIn a company of mixed monkeys, or a mixed company of monkeys, a\r\ntimid and fearsome individual is often made the butt of practical\r\njokes by other monkeys who recognize its weakness. And who has not\r\nseen the same trait revealed in crowds of boys?\r\n\r\nBut we can linger no longer with the Primates.\r\n\r\nWho has not seen squirrels at play? Once seen, such an incident is\r\nnot soon forgotten. I have seen gray, fox and red squirrels engage\r\nin highly interesting performances. The gray squirrel is stately\r\nand beautiful in its play, but the red squirrel is amazing in its\r\nelaborateness of method. I have seen a pair of those mischief-\r\nmakers perform low down on the trunk of a huge old virgin white\r\noak tree, where the holding was good, and work out a program\r\nalmost beyond belief. They raced and chased to and fro, up, down\r\nand across, in circles, triangles, parabolas and rectangles, until\r\nit was fairly bewildering. Really, they seemed to move just as\r\nfreely and certainly on the tree-trunk as if they were on the\r\nground, with no such thing in sight as the law of gravitation.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the gray squirrel barks and the red squirrel\r\nchatters, scolds, and at times swears, chiefly for the fun of\r\nhearing himself make a noise. In the red squirrel it is impudent\r\nand defiant; and usually you hear it near your camp, or in your\r\nown grounds, where the rascals know that they will not be shot.\r\n\r\nThe playful spirit seems to be inherent in the young of all the\r\nFelidae. The playfulness of lion, tiger, leopard and puma cubs is\r\nirresistibly pleasing; and it is worth while to rear domestic\r\nkittens in order to watch their playful antics.\r\n\r\nI have been assured by men who seemed to know, that wolf and fox\r\ncubs silently play in front of their home dens, when well screened\r\nfrom view, just as domestic dog puppies do; and what on earth can\r\nbeat the playfulness of puppies of the right kind, whose parents\r\nhave given them red blood instead of fat as their inheritance.\r\nInteresting books might be written about the play of dogs alone.\r\n\r\nThe play of the otter, in sliding down a long and steep toboggan\r\nslide of wet and slippery earth to a water plunge at the bottom,\r\nis well known to trappers, hunters, and a few naturalists. It is\r\nquite celebrated, and is on record in many places. I have seen\r\notter slides, but never had the good luck to see one in use. The\r\notters indulge in this very genuine sport with just as much\r\ninterest and zest as boys develop in coasting over ice and snow\r\nwith their sleds.\r\n\r\nHere at the Zoological Park, young animals of a number of species\r\namuse themselves in the few ways that are open to them. It is a\r\ncommon thing for fawns and calves of various kinds to butt their\r\nmothers, just for fun. A more common form of infantile ruminant\r\nsport is racing and jumping. Now and then we see a red buffalo\r\ncalf three or four months old suddenly begin a spell of running\r\nfor amusement, in the pure exuberance of health and good living. A\r\ncalf will choose a long open course, usually up and down a gentle\r\nslope, and for two hundred feet or more race madly to and fro for\r\na dozen laps, with tail stiffly and very absurdly held aloft. Of\r\ncourse men and beasts all pause to look at such performances, and\r\nat the finish the panting and perspiring calf halts and gazes\r\nabout with a conscious air of pride. All this is deliberate\r\n\"showing off,\" just such as small boys frequently engage in.\r\n\r\nElk fawns, and more rarely deer fawns, also occasionally indulge\r\nin similar performances. Often an adult female deer develops the\r\nsame trait. One of our female Eld's deer annually engages in a\r\nseries of spring runs. We have seen her race the full length of\r\nher corral, up and down, over a two hundred foot course, at really\r\nbreak-neck speed, and keep it up until her tongue hung out.\r\n\r\nYears ago, in the golden days, I was so lucky as to see several\r\ntimes wonderful dances of flocks of saras cranes on the low sandy\r\nislets in the River Jumna, northern India, just below Etawah. It\r\nwas like this: While the birds are idly stepping about, apropos of\r\nnothing at all, one suddenly flaps his long wings several times in\r\nsuccession, another jumps straight up in the air for a yard or so,\r\nand presto! with one accord the whole flock is galvanized into\r\naction. They throw aside their dignity, and real fun begins. Some\r\nstand still, heads high up, and flap their wings many times.\r\nOthers leap in the air, straight up and down, one jump after\r\nanother, as high as they can go. Others run about bobbing and\r\nbowing, and elaborately courtesying to each other with half opened\r\nwings, breasts low down and their tails high in the air, cutting\r\nvery ridiculous figures.\r\n\r\nIn springtime in the Zoological Park we often see similar\r\nexhibitions of crane play in our large crane paddock. A\r\nparticularly joyous bird takes a fit of running with spread wings,\r\nto and fro, many times over, and usually one bird thus performing\r\ninspires another, probably of his own kind, to join in the game.\r\nThe other cranes look on admiringly and sometimes a spectator\r\nshrilly trumpets his approval.\r\n\r\nIn his new book, \"The Friendly Arctic,\" Mr. Vilhjalmur Stefansson\r\nrecords an interesting example of play indulged in jointly by a\r\nfrivolous arctic fox and eight yearling barren-ground caribou. It\r\nwas a game of tag, or its wild equivalent. The fox ran into and\r\nthrough the group of caribou fawns, which gave chase and tried to\r\ncatch the fox, but in vain. At last the fawns gave up the chase,\r\nreturned to their original position, and came to parade rest. Then\r\nback came the fox. Again it scurried through the group in a most\r\ntantalizing manner, which soon provoked the fawns to chase the fox\r\nanew. At the end of this inning the caribou again abandoned the\r\nchase, whereupon the fox went off to attend to other affairs.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the play of wild animals is a large field and no\r\nwriter will exhaust it with one chapter. Very sincerely do we wish\r\nthat at least one of the many romance writers who are so\r\nindustriously inventing wild-animal blood-and-thunder stories\r\nwould do more work with his eyes and less with his imagination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nCOURAGE IN WILD ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nEither in wild animals or tame men, courage is the moral impulse\r\nthat impels an individual to fight or to venture at the risk of\r\nbodily harm. Like Theodore Roosevelt, the truly courageous\r\nindividual engages his adversary without stopping to consider the\r\npossible consequences to himself. The timid man shrinks from the\r\nonset while he takes counsel of his fears, and reflects that \"It\r\nmay injure me in my business,\" or that \"It may hurt my standing;\"\r\nand in the end he becomes a slacker.\r\n\r\nAmong the mental traits and passions of wild creatures, a\r\nquantitative and qualitative analysis of courage becomes a highly\r\ninteresting study. We can easily fall into the error of\r\nconsidering that fighting is the all-in-all measure of courage;\r\nwhich very often is far from being true. The mother quail that\r\npretends to be wounded and feigns helplessness in order to draw\r\nhostile attention unto herself and away from her young, thereby\r\ndisplays courage of a high order. No quail unburdened by a\r\nhelpless brood requiring her protection ever dreams of taking such\r\nrisks. The gray gibbons of Borneo, who quite successfully made\r\ntheir escape from us, but promptly returned close up to my party\r\nin response to the S. O. S. cries of a captured baby gibbon,\r\ndisplayed the sublime courage of parental affection, and of\r\ndesperation. Wary, timid and fearfully afraid of man, at the first\r\nsight of a biped they swing away. At the first roar of a gun they\r\nliterally fly down hill through the treetops, and vanish in a wild\r\npanic. And yet, the leading members of that troop halted and\r\nswiftly came back, piercing the gloom and silence of the forest\r\nwith their shrill cries of mingled encouragement and protest. It\r\nwas quite as courageous and heroic as the act of a father who\r\nrushes into a burning building to save his child, at the imminent\r\nrisk of his own life.\r\n\r\nThe animal world has its full share of heroes. Also, it has its\r\ncomplement of pugilists and bullies, its cowards and its\r\nassassins.\r\n\r\nFew indeed are the wild creatures that fight gratuitously, or\r\nattack other animals without cause. If a fight occurs, look for\r\nthe motive. The wild creatures know that peace promotes happiness\r\nand long life. Now, of all wild quadrupeds, it is probable that\r\nthe African baboons are pound for pound the most pugnacious, and\r\nthe quickest on the draw. The old male baboon in his prime will\r\nfight anything that threatens his troop, literally at the drop of\r\na hat. But there is method in his madness. He and his wives and\r\nchildren dwell on the ground in lands literally reeking with fangs\r\nand claws. He has to confront the lion, leopard, wild dog and\r\nhyena, and make good his right to live. No wonder, then, that his\r\ntemper is hot, his voice raucous and blood-curdling; his canines\r\nfearfully long and sharp, and his savage yell of warning\r\nsufficient to keep even the king of beasts off his grass.\r\n\r\nOnce I saw two baboons fight. We had two huge and splendid adult\r\nmale gelada baboons, from Abyssinia. They were kept separate, but\r\nin adjoining cages; and the time came when we needed one of those\r\ncages for another distinguished arrival. We decided to try the\r\nrather hazardous experiment of herding those two geladas together.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we first opened the doors to both outside cages, to\r\nafford for the moment a free circulation of baboons, and then we\r\nopened the partition door. Instantly the two animals rushed\r\ntogether in raging combat. With a fierce grip each seized the\r\nother by the left cheek; and then began a baboon cyclone. They\r\nspun around on their axis, they rolled over and over on the floor,\r\nand they waltzed in speechless rage over every foot of those two\r\ncages. Strange to say, beyond coughing and gasping they made no\r\nsounds. Never before had we witnessed such a fearsome exhibition\r\nof insane hatred and rage.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the horrified spectators could bring it about, the wild\r\nfighters were separated; and strange to say, neither of them was\r\nseriously injured. It was a drawn battle.\r\n\r\nIt is quite difficult to weigh and measure the independent and\r\nabstract courage inherent in any wild animal species. All that can\r\nbe done is to grope after the truth. On this subject there can be\r\nalmost as many different opinions as there are species of wild\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nWhat animal will go farthest in daring and defying man, even the\r\nman with a gun, in foraging for food?\r\n\r\nUnquestionably and indisputably, the lion. This is no idle\r\nrepetition of an old belief, or tradition. It is a fact; and we\r\nsay this quite mindful of the records made by the grizzly bear,\r\nthe Alaskan brown bear, the tiger, the leopard and the jaguar.\r\n\r\n\"The Man-Eaters of Tsavo\" opened up a strange and new chapter in\r\nthe life history of the savage lion. That truthful record of an\r\nastounding series of events showed the lion in an attitude of\r\npermanent aggression, backed by amazing and persistent courage.\r\nFor several months in that rude construction camp on the arid\r\nbank of the Tsavo River, where a railway bridge was being\r\nconstructed on the famous Uganda Railway line of British East\r\nAfrica, lions and men struggled mightily and fought with each\r\nother, with living men as the stakes of victory. The book written\r\nby Col. J.H. Patterson, under the title mentioned above, tells a\r\nplain and simple story of the nightly onslaughts of the lions, the\r\ntragedies suffered from them, the constant, the desperate though\r\noften ill-consideredefforts of the white engineers to protect\r\nthe terrorized black laborers, and finally the death of the man-\r\neaters. During a series of battles lasting four long months the\r\ntwo lions _killed and carried of a total of twenty-eight\r\nmen!_ How many natives were killed and not reported never will\r\nbe known. The most hair-raising episode of all had a comedy touch,\r\nand fortunately it did not quite end in a tragedy. This is what\r\nhappened:\r\n\r\nCol. Patterson and his staff decided to try to catch the boldest\r\nof the lions in a trap baited with _a living man._\r\nAccordingly a two-room trap was built, one room to hold and\r\nprotect the man-bait, the other to catch and hold the lion. A very\r\ncourageous native consented to be \"it,\" and he was put in place\r\nand fastened up. The lion came on schedule time, he found the\r\nlive bait, boldly entered the trap to seize it, and the dropping\r\ndoor fell as advertised. When the lion found himself caught, did\r\nhis capture trouble him? Not in the least. Instead of starting in\r\nto tear his way out he decided to postpone his escape until he\r\nhad torn down the partition and eaten the man! So at the\r\npartition he went, with teeth and claws.\r\n\r\nIn mortal terror the live bait yelled for succor. In \"the last\r\nanalysis\" the man was saved from the lion, but the lion joyously\r\ntore his way out and escaped without a scratch. So far from being\r\ndaunted by this divertisement he continued his man-killing\r\nindustry, quite as usual.\r\n\r\nNow, the salient points of the man-eaters of Tsavo consist of the\r\nunquenchable courage of the two lions, and their persistent\r\ndefiance of white men armed with rifles. I am sure that there is\r\nnowhere in existence another record of wild-animal courage equal\r\nto this, and the truthfulness of it is quite beyond question.\r\n\r\nThe annals of African travel and exploration contain instances\r\ninnumerable of the unparalleled courage of the lion in taking what\r\nhe wants when he wants it.\r\n\r\nTHE GRIZZLY BEAR'S COURAGE. As a subject, this is a\r\nhazardous risk, because so many men are able to tell all about it.\r\nJudging from reliable records of the ways and means of the grizzly\r\nbear, I think we must award the second prize for courage to \"Old\r\nEphraim.\" The list of his exploits in scaring pioneers, in\r\nattacking hunters, in robbing camps, and finally in bear-\r\nhandling and almost killing two guides in the Yellowstone Park, is\r\nlong and thrilling. The record reaches back to the days of Lewis\r\nand Clark, who related many wild adventures with bears. The\r\ngrizzlies of their day were very courageous, but even then they\r\nwere _not_ greatly given to attacking men quite unprovoked!\r\nIn those days of bow-and-arrow Indians, and of white men armed\r\nonly with ineffective muzzle-loading pea rifles, using only weak\r\nblack powder, the grizzlies had an even chance with their human\r\nadversaries, and sometimes they took first money. In those days\r\nthe courage of the grizzly was at its highest peak; and it was\r\nthen conceded by all frontiersmen that the grizzly was thoroughly\r\ncourageous, and always ready to fight. In the light of subsequent\r\nhistory, and in order to be just to the grizzly, we claim that his\r\nfighting was _in self defense,_ for even in those days the\r\nunwounded bear preferred to run rather than to fight\r\nunnecessarily.\r\n\r\nThe rise of the high-power, long-range repeating rifle has made\r\nthe grizzly bear a different animal from what he was in the days\r\nof Lewis and Clark. He has learned, _thoroughly,_ the supreme\r\ndeadliness of man's new weapons, and he knows that he is no longer\r\nable to meet men on even terms. Consequently, he runs, he hides,\r\nhe avoids man, everywhere save in the Yellowstone Park, where he\r\nhas found out that firearms are prohibited. There he has broken\r\nthe truce so often that his offenses have had to be met with stern\r\ndisciplinary measures that have made for the safety of tourists\r\nand guides.\r\n\r\nOnce I saw an amusing small incident. Be it known that when a new\r\nblack bear cub is introduced to a den of its peers, the newcomer\r\nshrinks in fright, and cowers, and takes its place right humbly.\r\nBut species alter cases. Once when we received an eight-months-\r\nold grizzly cub we turned it loose in a big den that contained\r\nfive black bear cubs a year older than itself. But did the grizzly\r\ncub cower and shrink? By no manner of means. With head fully\r\nerect, it marched calmly to the centre of the den, and with serene\r\nconfidence gave the other cubs the once-over with an air that\r\nplainly said: \"_I'm_ a grizzly! I'm here, and I've come to\r\nstay. Do I hear any objections?\"\r\n\r\nQuite as if in answer to the challenge, an eighteen-months-old\r\nblack bear presently sidled up and made a trial blow at the\r\ngrizzly's head. Instantly the grizzly cub's right arm shot out a\r\nwell-delivered blow that sent the black one scurrying away in a\r\npanic, and perceptibly cleared the atmosphere. That cub had\r\ngrizzly-bear _courage_ and _confidence;_ that was all.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of American sportsmen who esteem the Cape\r\nbuffalo as the most aggressive and dangerous wild animal in\r\neastern Africa. He is so courageous and so persistently bold that\r\nhe is much given to lying in wait for hunters and attacking with\r\nreal fury. The high grass of his swamps is very helpful to him as\r\na means of defense. In our National Collection of Heads and Horns\r\nthere is a huge buffalo head (for years the world's highest\r\nrecord) that tells the story of a near tragedy. The brother of Mr.\r\nF.H. Barber, of South Africa, fired at the animal, but failed to\r\nstop it. His gun jammed, and the charging beast was almost in the\r\nact of killing him when F.H. Barber fired without pausing to take\r\naim. His lucky bullet knocked a piece out of the buffalo's left\r\nhorn, dazed the animal for a moment, and afforded time for the\r\nshot that killed the mighty bull.\r\n\r\nThe leopard is usually a vicious beast. When brought to bay it\r\nfights with great fury and success. The black leopard is supremely\r\nvicious and intractable. Nearly all leopards hate training, and I\r\nhave seen two or three leopard \"acts\" that were nerve-racking to\r\nwitness because of the clear determination of all the animals to\r\nkill their trainer at the first opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe status of the big Alaskan brown bear has already been referred\r\nto in terms that may stand as an estimate of its courage. Really,\r\nit is now in the same mental state as the grizzly bears of the\r\ndays of Lewis and Clark, and the surplus must be shot to admonish\r\nthe survivors and protect the rights of man.\r\n\r\nTHE RAGE OF A WILD BULL ELK. One of the most remarkable\r\ncases of rage, resentment and fighting courage in a newly\r\ncaptured wild animal occurred near Buttonwillow, California, in\r\nNovember 1904, and is very graphically described by Dr. C. Hart\r\nMerriam in the _Scientific Monthly_ for November 1921. The\r\nstory concerns the leader of a band of the small California Valley\r\nElk (_Cervus nannodes_) which it was desired to transport to\r\nSequoia Park, for permanent preservation.\r\n\r\nThe bull refused to be driven to the corral for capture, so he was\r\nroped, thrown, hog-tied and hauled six miles on a wagon. This\r\nindignity greatly enraged the animal. At the corral he was\r\nliberated for the purpose of driving him through a chute and into\r\na car.\r\n\r\nFrom his capture and the jolting ride the bull was furious, and he\r\nrefused to be driven. His first act was to gore and mortally wound\r\na young elk that unfortunately found itself in the corral with\r\nhim. Then he was roped again and his horns were sawn off. At first\r\nno horseman dared to ride into the corral to attempt to drive the\r\nanimal. Finally the leader of the cowboys, Bill Woodruff, mounted\r\non a wise and powerful horse who knew the game quite as well as\r\nhis rider, rode into the corral with the raging elk, and attempted\r\nto drive it.\r\n\r\nThe story of the fight that followed, of raging elk vs. horse and\r\nman, makes stories of Spanish bullfights seem tame and\r\ncommonplace, and the adventure of St. George and the dragon a dull\r\naffair. With the stubs of his antlers the bull charged the horse\r\nagain and again, inflicting upon the splendid animal heart-rending\r\npunishment. Finally, after a fearful conflict, the wise and brave\r\nhorse conquered, and the elk devil was forced into the car.\r\n\r\nAfter a short railway journey the elk was forced into a crate,--\r\nfighting at every step,--and hauled a two days' journey to the\r\nPark. Reduced to kicking as its sole expression of resentment, the\r\nanimal kicked continuously for forty-eight hours, almost\r\ndemolishing the crate.\r\n\r\nThe final scene of this unparalleled drama of wild-animal rage is\r\nthus described by Dr. Merriam: \"Then the other gates were\r\nraised, giving the bull an opportunity to step out. For the\r\nfirst, time since his capture he did what was wanted; he\r\nvoluntarily crept to the rear of the wagon and hobbled out on the\r\nground. Looking around for an enemy to attack and not seeing any,\r\n--some of the men having stationed themselves outside the park\r\nfence, the others on top of the crate,--he set out for the river,\r\nonly a few rods away.\r\n\r\n\"His courage had not forsaken him, but his strength had. He was no\r\nlonger the proudly aggressive wild beast he had been. He had\r\nreached his limit. The terrible ordeal he had been through; the\r\nstruggle incident to his capture; the rough, hot ride to the\r\ncorral, hog-tied, on the hard floor of the dead-ax wagon; the\r\noutbursts of passion in the corral; the fighting and second roping\r\nin connection with the sawing off of his horns; the battle with\r\nthe big horse; the ceaseless violence of his destructive\r\nassaults, first in the car, then in the crate, continued for three\r\ndays and nights, had finally undermined even his iron frame; so\r\nwhen at last he found himself free on the ground, he presented a\r\ntruly pitiful picture.\r\n\r\n\"With his head bent to one side and back curved, with one ear up\r\nand the other down, and with a dejected, helpless expression on\r\nhis face, he hobbled wearily away, barely able to step without\r\nfalling. Slowly he made his way to the river, waded in, drank,\r\ncrossed to the far side, staggered laboriously up the low bank,\r\nand lay down. The next day he was found in the same spot,--dead.\"\r\n\r\nTHE DEFENSE OF THE HOME AND FAMILY. Any man who is too\r\ncowardly to fight for his home and country deserves to live and\r\ndie homeless and without a country.\r\n\r\nWith this subject of courage the parental and fraternal affections\r\nof wild animals are inseparably linked. The defense of the home\r\nand family unit is the foundation of all courage, and of all\r\nfighting qualities in man or animals. The gospel of self-defense\r\nis the first plank in the platform of the home defenders.\r\nObviously, the head of a family cannot permit himself to be\r\nknocked out, because as the chief fighter in the Home Defense\r\nLeague it is his bounden duty to preserve his strength and his\r\nweapons, and remain fit.\r\n\r\nIn the days of the club, the stone axe and the flint arrow-head,\r\nmen were few and feeble, and the wild beasts had no cause to fear\r\nextermination. Tooth, claw and horn were about as formidable as\r\nthe clumsy and inadequate weapons of man. The wild species went on\r\ndeveloping naturally, and some mighty hosts were the result.\r\n\r\nBut gunpowder changed all that. In the chase it gave weak men\r\ntheir innings beside the strong. Man could kill at long range,\r\nwith little danger to himself, or even with none at all. And then\r\nin the wild beast world the great final struggle for existence\r\nbegan. Man's flippant phrase,--\"the survival of the fittest,\"--\r\nbecame charged with sinister and deadly meaning.\r\n\r\nBut for Mother Love among wild creatures, species would not\r\nmultiply, and the earth soon would become depopulated. In the\r\nentire Deer Family of the world, the annual shedding of all horns\r\nis Nature's tribute to motherhood in the herd. A buck deer or a\r\nbull moose is a domineering master--so long as his antlers remain\r\nupon his head. But with the approach of fawn-bearing time in the\r\nherd, down they go. I have seen a bull elk stand with humbly\r\nlowered head, and gaze reproachfully upon his fallen antlers. The\r\ndehorned buck not only no longer hectors and drives the females,\r\nbut in fear of hurting his tender new velvet stubs he keeps well\r\naway from the front hoofs of the cows. The calves grow up quite\r\nsafe from molestation within the herd.\r\n\r\nIt may be set down as a basic truth that all vertebrate animals\r\nare ready to defend their homes and their young against all\r\nenemies that do not utterly outclass them in size and strength. Of\r\ncourse we do not expect the pygmy to try conclusions with the\r\ngiant, but at the same time, wild creatures have their own queer\r\nways of defense and counter-attack, and of matching superior\r\ncunning against superior force. But now, throughout the animal\r\nworld, the fear of man is paramount. Nearly all the wild ones have\r\nlearned it. It is only the enraged, the frightened or the cornered\r\nbear, lion, tiger or elephant that charges the Man with a Gun, and\r\nseeks to counter upon him with fang and claw before it drops. The\r\ndeadly supremacy of the repeating rifle that kills big game at\r\nhalf a mile, and the pump shotgun that gets five geese out of a\r\nflock, are well recognized by the terrorized big game and small\r\ngame that flies before the sweeping pestilence of machine guns and\r\nautomobiles.\r\n\r\nTHE FIGHTING CANADA GOOSE. In essaying to illustrate the\r\nhome defense spirit, my memory goes out to one truculent and\r\nfearless Canada goose whose mate elected to nest in a horribly\r\nexposed spot on the east bank of our Wild-Fowl Pond. The location\r\nwas an error in judgment. As soon as the nest was finished and the\r\neggs laid therein, the goose took her place upon the collection,\r\nand the gander mounted guard.\r\n\r\nThere were so many hostiles on the warpath that he was kept on the\r\nqui vive during all daylight hours. At a radius of about twenty\r\nfeet he drew an imaginary dead-line around the family nest, and no\r\nbird, beast or man could pass that line without a fight. If any\r\nother goose, or a swan or duck, attempted to pass, the guardian\r\ngander would rush forward with blazing eyes, open beak, wings open\r\nfor action, and with distended neck hiss out his challenge. If\r\nthe intruder failed to register respect, and came on, the gander\r\nwould seize the offender with his beak, and furiously wing-beat\r\nhim into flight. That gander was afraid of nothing, and his\r\ncourage and readiness to fight all comers, all day long, caused\r\nvisitors to accord him full recognition as a belligerent power.\r\n\r\nTHE CASE OF THE LAUGHING GULL. About that same time, a pair\r\nof laughing gulls had the temerity to build a nest on the ground\r\nin the very storm centre of the great Flying Cage. Daily and\r\nhourly they were surrounded by a truculent mob of pelicans,\r\nherons, ibises, storks, egrets and ducks, the most of whom\r\ndelighted in wrecking households. The keepers sided with the\r\ngulls by throwing around their nest a wire entanglement, with a\r\nsally-port at one side for the use of the beleaguered pair.\r\n\r\nThe voice of an angry or frightened laughing gull is it [sic]\r\nowner's chief defense. The female sat on her nest and shrieked out\r\nher shrill and defiant war cry of \"Kah! kah, kah, kah!\" The male\r\ntook post just outside the sally-port, where he postured and\r\nscreamed and threatened until we wondered why he did not burst\r\nwith superheated emotion. I am sure that never before did two\r\nsmall gulls ever raise so much racket in so short a time and their\r\ncage-mates must have found it rather trying.\r\n\r\nThe gulls hatched their eggs, they reared their young\r\nsuccessfully, and at last peace was restored.\r\n\r\nA Mother Antelope Fights Off an Eagle. Mr. Howard Eaton, of Wolf,\r\nWyoming, once saw a female prong-horned antelope put up a strong\r\nand successful fight in defense of her newly-born fawn. A golden\r\neagle, whose spring specialty is for fawns, kids and lambs, was\r\nseen to swoop swiftly down toward a solitary antelope that had\r\nbeen noticed on a treeless range beside the Little Missouri. It\r\nquickly became evident that the eagle was after an antelope fawn.\r\nAs the bird swooped down toward the mother, and endeavored to\r\nseize her fawn in its talons, the doe rose high on her hind legs,\r\nand with her forelegs flying like flails struck with her sharp-\r\npointed hoofs again and again. Her blows went home, and feathers\r\nwere seen to fly from the body of the marauder.\r\n\r\nThe doe made good her defense. The eagle was glad to escape, and\r\nas quickly as possible pulled himself together and flew away.\r\n\r\nThe Defensive Circle of the Musk-Ox. Several arctic explorers have\r\ndescribed the wonderful living-ring defense, previously mentioned,\r\nof musk-ox herds against wolves. Mr. Paul Rainey's moving pictures\r\nhave shown it to us in thrilling detail, with Eskimo dogs instead\r\nof wolves. When a musk-ox herd is attacked by the big and deadly\r\narctic white wolves, the bulls and adult cows herd the calves and\r\nyoung stock into a compact group, then take their places shoulder\r\nto shoulder around them in a perfect circle, and with lowered\r\nheads await the onset. The sharp down-and-up curved horn of the\r\nmusk-ox is a deadly weapon against all the dangerous animals of\r\nthe North, except man.\r\n\r\nWhen a wolf approaches near and endeavors to make a breach in the\r\ncircle, the musk-ox nearest him tries to get him, and will even\r\nrush out of the line for a short and brief pursuit. But the bull\r\ndoes not pursue more than twenty yards or so, for fear of being\r\nsurrounded alone and cut off. At the end of his usually futile\r\nrun, back he goes and carefully backs into his place in the first\r\nline of defense. A charging bull does not rush out far enough that\r\nthe wolves can cut him off and kill him. He is much too wise for\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nMr. Stefansson says that the impregnability of the musk-ox defense\r\nis so well recognized by the wolves of the North that often a pack\r\nwill march past a herd in close proximity without offering to\r\nattack it, and without even troubling the herd to form the hollow\r\ncircle.\r\n\r\nA Savage Wild Boar. I once had a \"fight\" with a captive Japanese\r\nwild boar, under conditions both absurd and tragic, and from it I\r\nlearned the courage and fury of such animals. The animal was\r\nlarge, powerful, fearfully savage toward every living thing, and\r\ninsanely courageous. It was confined in a yard enclosed by a\r\nstrong wire fence, and while we were all very sure that the fence\r\nwould hold it, I became uneasy. In mid-afternoon I went alone to\r\nthe spot, passing hundreds of school children on the way, to study\r\nthe situation. When I reached the front of the corral and stood\r\nstill to look at the fence, the boar immediately rushed for me. He\r\ncame straight on, angry and terrible, and charged the wire like a\r\nliving battering-ram. He repeated these charges until I became\r\nfearful of an outbreak, and decided to try to make him afraid to\r\nrepeat them. Procuring from the bear dens, a pike pole with a\r\nstout spike in the end, I received the next charge with a return\r\nthrust meant to puncture both the boar's hide and his\r\nunderstanding. He backed off and charged more furiously than ever,\r\nwith white foam flying from his jaws.\r\n\r\nHe cared nothing for his punishment. He charged until his snout\r\nbled freely, and the fence bulged at the strain.\r\n\r\nThen I became regularly scared! I feared that the savage beast\r\nwould break through the fence in spite of its strength, and run\r\namuck among those helpless children. I \"beat it\" back to my\r\noffice, hurried back with one of my loaded rifles, and without\r\nlosing a second put a bullet through that raging brain and ended\r\nthat danger forever.\r\n\r\nThe Overrated Peccary. This reminds me that the collared peccary\r\nhas been credited with a degree of courage that has been much\r\nexaggerated. While a hunted and cornered peccary will fight dogs\r\nor men, and put up a savage and dangerous defense, men whom I\r\nknow in the peccary belt of Mexico have assured me that a drove of\r\npeccaries will _not_ attack a hunter who has killed one of\r\ntheir mates, nor keep him up a tree for hours while they swarm\r\nunderneath him waiting for his blood. I have been assured by\r\ncompetent witnesses that in peccary hunting there is no danger\r\nwhatever of mass attack through a desire for revenge, and that\r\npeccaries fired at will run like deer.\r\n\r\nA Black Bear Killed a Man for Food. There is on record at least\r\none well-authenticated case of a black bear deliberately going out\r\nof his way to cross a river, attack a man and kill him.\r\n\r\nOn May 17, 1907, at a lumber camp of the Red Deer Lumber Company,\r\nthirty miles south of Etiomami on the Canadian Northern Railway,\r\nNorthwest Territory, a cook named T. Wilson was chased by a large\r\nblack bear, without provocation, struck once on the head, and\r\ninstantly killed. The bear then picked him up, carried him a short\r\ndistance, and proceeded to _eat_ him. Ten shots from a .32\r\ncalibre revolver had no effect. Later a rifle ball drove the bear\r\naway, but only after it had eaten the left thigh and part of the\r\nbody. (Forest and Stream, Feb. 8, 1908.)\r\n\r\nThe Status of the Gray Wolf. In America wolves rarely succeed in\r\nkilling men, although they often follow men's trails in the hope\r\nof spoil of some kind. But there are exceptions.\r\n\r\nIn 1912, around Lake Nipigon, Province of Ontario, Canada, there\r\nexisted a reign of terror from wolves. The first man killed was a\r\nhalf-breed mail-carrier. Then, in December, another mail-carrier,\r\nwho was working the lumber camps north of Lake Nipigon, was killed\r\nby wolves and completely devoured. The snow showed a terrible\r\nstruggle, in which four large wolves had been killed by the\r\ncarrier.\r\n\r\nIn Russia and in France in the days preceding the use of modern\r\nbreech-loading firearms, the gray wolves of Europe were very bold,\r\nand a great many people were killed by them.\r\n\r\nKillings by Wild Beasts in India. The killing by wild beasts of\r\nunarmed and defenseless native men, women and children in India is\r\na very different matter from man-killing in resourceful and\r\ndangerous North America. The annual slaughter by wild beasts in\r\nHindustan and British Burma is a fairly good index of the courage\r\nand aggressiveness of the parties of the first part. In India\r\nduring the year 1878, in which we were specially interested, the\r\ntotals were as follows:\r\n\r\nPersons killed by elephants, 33; tigers, 816; leopards, 300;\r\nbears, 94; wolves, 845; hyenas, 33; snakes, 16,812.\r\n\r\nOf course such slaughter as this by the ridiculous hyenas and the\r\nabsurd sloth bears of India is possible only in a country wherein\r\nthe swarming millions of people are universally defenseless, and\r\nchildren are superabundant.\r\n\r\nAs a corollary to the above figures, a comparison of them with the\r\nroster of wild animals killed and paid for is of some interest.\r\nThe dangerous beasts destroyed were as follows:\r\n\r\nElephants, 1; tigers, 1,493; leopards, 3,387; bears, 1,283;\r\nwolves, 5,067; hyenas, 1,202; serpents, 117,782.\r\n\r\nThe Fighting Spirit in Baboons. In the first analysis, we find\r\nthat courage is an individual trait, and that so far as we know,\r\nit never characterizes all the individuals of any one species. The\r\nstrongest and the best armed of men and beasts usually are\r\naccounted the bravest ones of earth. The defenseless ones do well\r\nto be timid, to avoid hostilities and to flee from conflict to\r\navoid being destroyed. It is just as much the duty of a\r\nprofessional mother to flee and to hide, in order to save her own\r\nlife, as it is for \"the old he-one\" to threaten and to fight.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, there are many species which are concededly\r\ncourageous, as species. In making up this list I would place first\r\nof all the baboons of eastern Africa, whom I regard collectively\r\nas the most bold and reckless fighters per pound avoirdupois to be\r\nfound in the whole Order Primates. They have weapons, agility,\r\nstrength and cyclonic courage. On no other basis could they have\r\nso long survived _on land_ in a country full of lions,\r\nleopards, cheetahs, hyenas and wild dogs.\r\n\r\nIn order to appreciate the fighting spirit of a male baboon, the\r\nobserver need only come just once in actual touch with one. A\r\ndozen times I have been seized by a powerful baboon hand shot out\r\nwith lightning quickness between or under his cage bars. The\r\ncombined strength and ferocity of the grab, and the grip on the\r\nhuman hand or arm, is unbelievable until felt, and this with an\r\naccompaniment of glaring eyes, snarling lips and nerve-ripping\r\nvoice is quite sufficient to intimidate any ordinary man.\r\n\r\nBut even in the courage and belligerency of baboons, there are\r\nsome marked differences between species. I rank them as follows:\r\n\r\nThe most fierce and dangerous species is the East African baboon.\r\n\r\nThe next for courage is the Rhodesian species.\r\n\r\nThe spectacular hamadryas baboon is a very good citizen. The\r\nlong-armed yellow species makes very little trouble, and\r\n\r\nThe small golden baboon is the best-behaved of them all.\r\n\r\nCourage in the Great Apes. After forty years of ape study, with\r\nmany kinds of evidence, I am convinced that the courage and the\r\nalleged ferocity of the gorilla has been much over-rated. I\r\nbelieve this is due to the influence upon the human mind of the\r\ngreat size and terrifying aspect of the animal.\r\n\r\nOf all the men whom I have known or read, the late R. L. Garner\r\nknew by far the most of gorilla habits and character by personal\r\nobservation in the gorilla jungles of equatorial Africa. And\r\nnever, in several years of intimate contact with Mr, Garner did he\r\nso much as once put forth a statement or an estimate that seemed\r\nto me exaggerated or overcolored.\r\n\r\nIn our many discussions of gorilla character Mr. Garner always\r\nrepresented that animal as very shy, wary of observation by man,\r\nprofoundly cunning in raiding _in darkness_ the banana\r\nplantations of man's villages, and most carefully avoiding\r\nexposures by daylight. He described the gorilla as practically\r\nnever attacking men unless first attacked by them, and fleeing\r\nunless forcibly brought to bay. He told me of are doubtable\r\nAfrican tribesman who once captured a baby gorilla on the ground\r\nby suddenly attacking the mother with his club and beating her so\r\nsuccessfully that she fled from him and abandoned her young.\r\n\"But,\" said Mr. Garner, \"there is only one tribe in Africa that\r\ncould turn out a man who would attempt a feat like that.\"\r\n\r\nThat the gorilla can and will fight furiously and effectively when\r\nbrought to bay is well known, and never denied.\r\n\r\nOf the apes I have known in captivity, the chimpanzees are by far\r\nthe most aggressive, courageous and dangerous. A vigorous male\r\nspecimen over eight years of age is more dangerous than a lion,\r\nor tiger, or grizzly bear, and _far more anxious_ to fight\r\nsomething. I think that even if our Boma were muzzled, no five men\r\nof my acquaintance could catch him and tie his hands and feet.\r\n\r\nThe orang-utan is only half the fighter that the chimpanzee is.\r\nEven the adult males are not persistently aggressive, or inflamed\r\nby savage desires to hurt somebody.\r\n\r\nCourage in Elephants as an Asset. In all portions of India wherein\r\ntiger hunting with elephants is practiced, elephants with good\r\ncourage are at a premium. No elephant is fit to carry a howdah in\r\na line of beaters, with a valuable sahib on board, unless its\r\ncourage can stand the acid test of a wounded tiger's charge. When\r\nan elephant can endure without panic an infuriated tiger climbing\r\nup its frontispiece to get at the unhappy mahout and the hunter,\r\nthat elephant belongs in the courageous class. The cowardly\r\nelephant screams in terror, bolts for the rear, and if there is a\r\ntree in the landscape promptly wrecks the howdah and the sportsman\r\nagainst its lower branches.\r\n\r\nA \"rogue\" elephant always reminds me of my Barbados boatman's\r\ndescription of a pugnacious friend: \"De trouble is, he am too\r\nbrave!\" A rogue elephant will attack anything from a wheelbarrow\r\nto a hut, and destroy it. The peak of rogue ambition was reached\r\non a railway in Burma, near Ban Klap, in March 1908, when a rogue\r\nelephant \"on hearing the locomotive whistle, trumpeted loudly and\r\nthen, lowering his head, charged the oncoming train. The impact\r\nwas tremendous. Such was the impetus of the great pachyderm that\r\nthe engine was partially derailed, the front of the smoke-box\r\nshattered as far as the tubes, the cow-catcher was crushed into a\r\nshapeless piece of iron, and other damages of minor importance\r\nwere sustained. The train was going thirty-four miles per hour,\r\nand the engine alone weighed between forty and fifty tons.\r\n\r\n\"Of course the elephant was killed by the shock, its head being\r\ncompletely smashed.... It is believed that this particular rogue\r\nhad been responsible for considerable damage to villages in the\r\nvicinity of Lopbusi. A number of houses have been pulled down\r\nrecently and havoc wrought in other ways.\"\r\n\r\nOn another occasion a vicious rogue elephant elected to try\r\nconclusions with a railway train. In 1906, on the Korat branch of\r\nthe Siamese State Railway, a bull elephant attacked a freight\r\ntrain running at full speed. He charged the rushing locomotive,\r\nwith the result that the locomotive and several cars were derailed\r\nand sent down the side of the grade, and two persons were killed.\r\nThe elephant was killed outright and buried under the wreck of the\r\ntrain. This occurred in open country, where there was no excuse\r\nfor an elephant on the track, and therefore the charge of the\r\nrogue was wholly gratuitous.\r\n\r\nCaptive elephants whose managers are too humane to punish them for\r\nmanifestations of meanness become spoiled by their immunity, just\r\nas mean children are spoiled when fond and foolish parents feel\r\nthat their little jackets are too sacred ever to be tanned. Such\r\ncomplete immunity is as bad for bad elephants as for bad\r\nchildren, but in practice the severe punishment of an elephant\r\nwith real benefit to the animal is next door to an impossibility,\r\nand so we never attempt it. We do, however, inflict mild\r\npunishments, of the fourth order of efficiency.\r\n\r\nAnimals and Men. Among the animals that are most courageous\r\nagainst man are the species and individuals that are most familiar\r\nwith him, and feel for him both contempt and hatred. The cat\r\nscratches, the bad dog bites, the vicious horse kicks or bites,\r\nand the mean pet bear, tiger, ape, leopard, bison or deer will\r\nattempt injury or murder whenever they think the chance has\r\narrived. I know a lady whose pet monkey is a savage and mean\r\nlittle beast, and because she never thrashes it as it deserves,\r\nboth of her arms from wrist to elbow have been scarified by its\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nMr. E. R. Sanborn, official photographer of the Zoological Park,\r\nonce made an ingenious and also terrifying experiment. He made an\r\nexcellent dummy keeper, stood it up, and tied it fast against the\r\nfence inside the yard of our very large and savage male Grevy\r\nZebra. Then he posed his moving picture camera in a safe place,\r\nand the keeper turned the zebra into the yard. The moment the\r\nbad zebra caught sight of the presumptive keeper,--at last within\r\nhis power,--he rushed at the dummy with glaring eyes and open\r\nmouth, and seized his victim by the head. With furious efforts he\r\ntore the dummy loose from its moorings, whirled it into the middle\r\nof the yard, where in a towering rage he knelt upon it, bit and\r\ntore its heart out. Of course the unfortunate dummy perished. The\r\nzebra reveled in his triumph, and altogether it was a fearsome\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nCAUTION. A thoroughly cowardly horse _never_ should be\r\nridden, nor driven to anything so light that a runaway is\r\npossible. Such animals are too expensive both to human life and to\r\nproperty. A dangerous horse can be just as great a risk as a bad\r\nlion or bear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--THE BASER PASSIONS\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\nFEAR AS A RULING PASSION\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we were asked, \"Which one may be called the ruling passion of\r\nthe wild animal?\" we would without hesitation answer,--it is fear.\r\n\r\nFrom the cradle to the grave, every strictly wild animal lives,\r\nday and night, in a state of fear of bodily harm, and dread of\r\nhunger and famine.\r\n\r\n\"Now the 'free, wild life' is a round of strife, And of\r\nceaseless hunger and fear; And the life in the wild of the\r\nanimal child Is not all skittles and beer.\"\r\n\r\nThe first thing that the wild baby learns, both by precept and\r\nexample, is safety first! When the squalling and toddling bear cub\r\nfirst goes abroad, the mother bear is worried and nervous for fear\r\nthat in a sudden and dangerous emergency the half-helpless little\r\none will not be able to make a successful get-away when the alarm-\r\nsignal snort is given. During the first, and most dangerous, days\r\nin the life of the elk, deer and antelope fawn, the first care of\r\nthe mother is to hide her offspring in a spot cunningly chosen\r\nbeside a rock, beside a log, or in thick bushes. In the absence of\r\nall those she looks for a depression in the earth wherein the fawn\r\ncan lie without making a hump in the landscape. The first impulse\r\nof the fawn,--even before nursing if the birth occurs in\r\ndaylight,--is to fold its long legs, short body and reptilian neck\r\ninto a very small package, hug the earth tightly, close its eyes\r\nand lie absolutely motionless until its mother gives the signal to\r\narise and sup. Such infants may lie for long and weary hours\r\nwithout so much as moving an ear; and the anxious mother strolls\r\naway to some distance to avoid disclosing her helpless offspring.\r\n\r\nNow, suppose you discover and touch an elk or a deer fawn while\r\nthus hiding. What will it do? Nine times out of ten it will bound\r\nup as if propelled by steel springs, and go off like an arrow from\r\na bow, dashing in any direction that is open and leads straight\r\naway. The horrified mother will rush into view in dangerously near\r\nproximity, and I have seen a wild white-tailed deer doe tear\r\nmadly up and down in full view and near by, to attract the danger\r\nto herself.\r\n\r\nThousands of men and boys have seen a mother quail flop and\r\nflutter and play wounded, to lead the dangerous boy away from her\r\nbrood of little quail mites, and work the ruse so daringly and\r\nsuccessfully as to save both her babies and herself. I well\r\nremember my surprise and admiration when a mother quail first\r\nplayed that trick upon me. I expected to pick her up,--and forgot\r\nall about the chicks,--until they were every one safely in hiding,\r\nand then Mrs. Quail gave me the laugh and flew away.\r\n\r\nWas it strategy? Was it the result of quail thought and reason? Or\r\ndid it come by heredity, just like walking? To deny the cold facts\r\nin the quail case is to discredit our own ability to reason and be\r\nhonest.\r\n\r\nFear is the ruling emotion alike of the most timid creatures, and\r\nalso the boldest. Of course each wild animal keeps a mental list\r\nof the other animals of which he is not afraid; and the predatory\r\nanimal also keeps a card catalogue of those which he may safely\r\nattack when in need of food.\r\n\r\nBut, with all due consideration to mighty forearm, to deadly claws\r\nand stabbing fangs, there is (I think) absolutely no land animal\r\nthat is not afraid of something. Let us progressively consider a\r\nfew famous species near at hand.\r\n\r\nThe savage and merciless weasel fears the fox, the skunk, the wolf\r\nand the owl. The skunk fears the coyote which joyously kills him\r\nand devours all of him save his jaws and his tail. The marten,\r\nmink and fisher have mighty good reason to fear the wolverine, who\r\nin his turn cheerfully gives the road to the gray wolf. The wolf\r\nand the lynx carefully avoid the mountain lion and the black bear,\r\nand the black bear is careful not to get too close to a grizzly.\r\nToday a cotton-tail rabbit is not more afraid of a hound than a\r\ngrizzly bear is of a man. The polar bear once was bold in the\r\npresence of man; but somebody has told him about breech-loading\r\nhigh power rifles; and now he, too, runs in terror from every man\r\nthat he sees. The lion, the tiger, the leopard and the jaguar all\r\nlive in wholesome fear of man, and flee from him at sight. The\r\nlordly elephant does likewise, and so does the rhinoceros, save\r\nwhen he is in doubt about the identity of the biped animal and\r\ntrots up to get certainty out of a nearer view. Col. Roosevelt\r\nbecame convinced, that most of the alleged \"charging\" of\r\nrhinoceroses was due to curiosity and poor vision, and the desire\r\nof rhinos to investigate at close range.\r\n\r\nToday the giant brown bears of Alaska exhibit less fear of man\r\nthan any other land animals that we know, and many individuals\r\nhave put themselves on record as dangerous fighters. And this\r\nopens the door to the great Alaskan controversy that for a year\r\nraged,--chiefly upon one side,--in certain Alaskan newspapers and\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1920, certain parties in Alaska publicly asked people to\r\nbelieve that W. T. Hornaday in his \"published works\" had set up\r\nthe Alaskan brown bear as \"a harmless animal.\" All these\r\nstatements and insinuations were notoriously false, but the\r\nrepetition of them went on right merrily, even while the author's\r\narticle portraying the savage and dangerous character of the brown\r\nbear was being widely circulated in the United States through\r\n_Boys' Life_ magazine.\r\n\r\nThe indisputable facts regarding the temper of the great Alaskan\r\nbrown bears are as follows: Usually, unless fired at, these big\r\nbrown bears flee from man at sight of him, and by many experienced\r\nAlaskan bear hunters who can shoot they are not regarded as\r\nparticularly dangerous, save when they are attacked by man, or\r\nthink that they are to be attacked.\r\n\r\nThey are just now the boldest of all bears, and the most\r\ndangerous.\r\n\r\nThey often attack men who are hunting them, and have killed\r\nseveral.\r\n\r\nThey have attacked a few persons who were not hunting.\r\n\r\nWhere they are really numerous they are a menace and a nuisance to\r\nfrontiersmen who need to traverse their haunts.\r\n\r\nIn all places where Alaskan brown bears are quite too numerous for\r\npublic safety, their numbers should thoroughly be reduced; and\r\neverywhere the bears of Alaska should be pursued and shot until\r\nthe survivors acquire the wholesome respect for man that now is\r\nfelt everywhere by the polar and the grizzly. Then the Alaskans\r\nwill have peace, and our Alaskan enemies possibly will cease to\r\ntry to discredit our intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe most impressive exhibition of wild-animal fear that Americans\r\never have seen was furnished by the African motion pictures of\r\nPaul J. Rainey. They were taken from a blind constructed within\r\nclose range of a dry river bed in northern British East Africa,\r\nwhere a supply of water was held, by a stratum of waterproof clay\r\nor rock, about four feet below the surface of the dry river bed.\r\nBy industrious pawing the zebras had dug a hole down to the water,\r\nand to this one life-saving well wild animals of many species\r\nflocked from miles around. The camera faithfully recorded the\r\ndoings of elephants, giraffes, zebras, hartebeests, gnus,\r\nantelopes of several species, wart-hogs and baboons.\r\n\r\nThe personnel of the daily assemblage was fairly astounding, and\r\nto a certain extent the observer of those wonderful pictures can\r\nfrom them read many of the thoughts of the animals.\r\n\r\nNext to the plainly expressed desire to quench their thirst, the\r\ndominant thought in the minds of those animals, one and all, was\r\nthe _fear of being attacked._ In some species this ever-\r\npresent and harassing dread was a pitiful spectacle. I wish it\r\nmight be witnessed by all those ultra-humane persons who think and\r\nsay that the free wild animals are the only happy ones!\r\n\r\nWith the possible exception of the sanguine-tempered elephants,\r\nall those animals were afraid of being seized or attacked while\r\ndrinking. One and all did the same thing. An animal would approach\r\nthe water-hole, nervously looking about for enemies. The fore feet\r\ncautiously stepped down, the head disappeared to reach the water,\r\n--but quickly shot upward again, to look for the enemies. It was\r\nalternately drink, look, drink, look, for a dozen quick\r\nrepetitions, then a scurry for safety.\r\n\r\nEven the stilt-legged and long-necked giraffes went through that\r\nsame process,--a mouthful of water greedily seized, and a fling of\r\nthe head upward to stare about for danger. Group by group the\r\nanimals of each species took their turns. The baboons drifted down\r\nover the steep rocky slope like a flock of skimming birds, and\r\nwatched and drank by turn. Having finished, they paused not for\r\nidle gossip or play, but as swiftly as they came drifted up the\r\nslope and sought safety elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, it was noticeable that during the whole of that\r\nastounding panorama of ferae naturae unalloyed by man's baleful\r\ninfluence, no species attacked another, there was no fighting, nor\r\neven any threatening of any kind. Had there been a white flag\r\nwaving over that water-hole, the truce of the wild could not have\r\nbeen more perfect.\r\n\r\nEffect of Fear in Captive Animals. Among captive wild animals, by\r\nfar the most troublesome are those that are obsessed by slavish\r\nfear of being harmed. The courageous and supremely confident\r\ngrizzly or Alaskan brown bear is in his den a good-natured and\r\nreliable animal, who obeys orders when the keepers enter the den\r\nto do the daily housework and order him to \"Get up out of here.\"\r\nThe fear-possessed Japanese black bear, Malay sun bear and Indian\r\nsloth bear are the ones that are most dangerous, and that\r\nsometimes charge the keepers.\r\n\r\nOur famous \"picture lion,\" Sultan, was serenely confident of his\r\nown powers, his nerves were steady and reliable, and he never\r\ncared to attack man or beast. Once when by the error of a fellow\r\nkeeper the wrong chain was pulled, and the wrong partition door\r\nwas opened, the working keeper bent his head, and broom in hand\r\nwalked into what he thought was an empty cage. To his horror, he\r\nfound himself face to face with Sultan, with only the length of\r\nthe broom handle between them.\r\n\r\nThe startled and helpless keeper stood still, and said in a calm\r\nvoice, without batting an eye.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Sultan.\"\r\n\r\nSultan calmly looked at him, wonderingly and inquiringly, but\r\nwithout even a trace of excitement; and feeling sure that the\r\nkeeper did not mean to harm him, he seemed to have no thought of\r\nattacking.\r\n\r\nThe keeper quietly backed through the low doorway, and gently\r\nclosed the door. Had the keeper lost his nerve, _and shown\r\nit,_ there might have been a tragedy.\r\n\r\nLions are the best of all carnivorous performing animals, because\r\nof their courage, serenity, self-confidence and absence of jumpy\r\nnerves. Leopards are the worst, and polar bears stand next, with\r\nbig chimpanzees as a sure third. Beware of all three.\r\n\r\nExceptions to the Rule of Fear. Fortunately for the wild animal\r\nworld, there are some exceptions to the rule of fear. I will\r\nindicate the kinds of them, and students can supply the individual\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nWhenever a wild animal species inhabits a spot so remote and\r\ninaccessible that man's blighting hand never has fallen upon it,\r\nnor in any way influenced its life or its fortunes, that species\r\nknows no fear save from the warring elements, and from predatory\r\nanimals. The wonderful giant penguins found and photographed\r\nnear the south pole by Sir Ernest Shackleton never had seen nor\r\nheard of men, never had been attacked by predatory animals or birds.\r\nYou may search this wide world over, and you will not find a more\r\nstriking example of sublime isolation. Those penguins had been\r\nliving in a penguin's paradise. The sea-leopard seals harmed them\r\nnot, and until the arrival of the irrepressible British explorer the\r\nspell  of that antarctic elysium was unbroken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration\r\nwith caption: PRIMITIVE PENGUINS ON THE ANTARCTIC CONTINENT,\r\nUNAFRAID OF MAN (From Sir Ernest Shackleton's \"Heart of the\r\nAntarctic,\" by permission of William Heinemann and the J. B.\r\nLippincott Company, publishers)]\r\n\r\nThose astounding birds knew no such emotion as fear. Under the\r\nimpulse of the icy waves dashing straight up to the edge of the\r\nice floes, those giant penguins shot out of the water, sped like\r\ncatapulted birds curving through the air, and landed on their\r\ncushioned breasts high and dry, fully ten feet back from the edge\r\nof the floe. They flocked together, they waddled about erect and\r\nserene, heads high in air, and marched close up to the ice-bound\r\nship to see what it was all about. Men and horses freely walked\r\namong them without exciting fear, and when the birds gathered in a\r\nvast assemblage the naturalists and photographers were welcomed\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed those birds were well-nigh the most fortunate birds in\r\nall the world. The men who found them were not low-browed\r\nbutchers thinking only of \"oil\" or \"fertilizer\"; and they did not\r\ngo to work at once to club all those helpless birds into masses of\r\ndeath and corruption. Those men wondered at them, laughed at them,\r\nphotographed them, studied them,--and _left them in peace!_\r\n\r\nWhat a thundering contrast that was with the usual course of Man,\r\nthe bloody savage, under such circumstances! The coast of Lower\r\nCalifornia once swarmed with seals, sea-lions and birds, and the\r\nwaters of the Gulf were alive with whales. Now the Gulf and the\r\nshores of the Peninsula are as barren of wild life as Death\r\nValley.\r\n\r\nThe history of the whaling industry contains many sickening\r\nrecords of the wholesale slaughter by savage whalers of newly\r\ndiscovered herds of walrus, seals and sea birds that through\r\nisolation knew no fear, and were easily clubbed to death en masse.\r\n\r\nWild creatures generally subscribe to the political principle that\r\nin union there is strength. In the minds of wild animals, birds\r\nand reptiles, great numbers of individuals massed together make\r\nfor general security from predatory attacks. The herd with its\r\nmany eyes and ears feels far greater security, and less harrowing\r\nfear, than the solitary individual who must depend upon his own\r\ntwo pair. The herd members relax and enjoy life; but the solitary\r\nbear, deer, sheep, goat or elephant does not. His nerves always\r\nare strung up to concert pitch, and while he feeds or drinks, or\r\ntravels, he watches his step. A moving object, a strange-looking\r\nobject, a strange sound or a queer scent in the air instantly\r\nfixes his attention, and demands analysis.\r\n\r\nOn the North American continent the paramount fear of the wild\r\nanimal is aroused to its highest pitch by what is called \"man\r\nscent.\" And really, from the Battery to the North Pole, there is\r\ngood reason for this feeling of terror, and high wisdom in fleeing\r\nfast and far.\r\n\r\nSaid a wise old Ojibway Indian to Arthur Heming:\r\n\r\n\"My son, when I smell some men, and especially some white men, I\r\nnever blame the animals of the Strong Woods for taking fright and\r\nrunning away!\"\r\n\r\nAnd civilization also has its terrors, as much as the wilderness.\r\n\r\nThe fox, no matter what is the color of his coat, or his given\r\nname, is the incarnation of timidity and hourly fear. The\r\nnocturnal animals go abroad and work at night solely because they\r\nare afraid to work in the daytime. The beaver will cheerfully work\r\nin daytime if there is no prospect of observation or interference\r\nby man. The eagle builds in the top of the tallest tree, and the\r\nCalifornia condor high up on the precipitous side of a frightful\r\ncanyon wall, because they are afraid of the things on the ground\r\nbelow. In the great and beautiful Animallai Forest (of Southern\r\nIndia), in 1877 the tiger walked abroad in the daytime, because\r\nmen were few and weak, but in the populous and dangerous plains he\r\ndid his traveling and killing at night, and lay closely hidden by\r\nday.\r\n\r\nJudging by the records of those who have hunted lions, I think\r\nthat naturally the lion has more courage and less fear of bodily\r\nharm than any other wild animal of equal intelligence. By reason\r\nof his courage and self-confidence, as well as his majesty of\r\nphysique, the lion is indeed well worthy to be called the King of\r\nBeasts.\r\n\r\nAmong the few animals that seem naturally bold and ready to take\r\nrisks, a notable species is the gray wolf. But is it really free\r\nfrom fear? Far from it. When in touch with civilization, from dawn\r\nuntil dark the wolf never forgets to look out for his own safety.\r\nHe fears man, he fears the claws of every bear, he fears traps,\r\npoison and the sharp horns of the musk-ox. Individually the wolf\r\nis a contemptible coward. Rarely does he attack all alone an\r\nanimal of his own size, unless it is a defenseless colt, calf or\r\nsheep. No animal is more safe from another than an able-bodied\r\nbull from the largest wolf. The wolf believes in mass action, not\r\nin single combat.\r\n\r\nBut there is hope for the harassed and nerve-racked children of\r\nthe wild. _The Game Sanctuary has come!_ Its area of safety,\r\nand its magic boundary, are quickly recognized by the harried\r\ndeer, elk, sheep, goat and antelope, and right quickly do these\r\nand all other wild animals set up housekeeping on a basis of\r\nabsolute safety. Talk about wild animals not \"reasoning!\" For\r\nshame. What else than REASON convinced the wild mountain sheep in\r\nthe rocky fastnesses they once inhabited in terror that now they\r\nare SAFE, even in the streets of Ouray, and that \"Ouray\" rhymes\r\nwith \"your hay\"?\r\n\r\nOn account of his crimes against wild life, man (both civilized\r\nand savage) has much to answer for; but each wild life sanctuary\r\nthat he now creates wipes out one chapter. From the Cape to Cairo,\r\nfrom the Aru Islands to Tasmania and from Banks Land to the\r\nMexican boundary, they are growing and spreading. In them, save\r\nfor the misdoings of the few uncaught and unkilled predatory\r\nanimals, fear can die out, and the peace of paradise regained take\r\nits place.\r\n\r\nHYSTERIA OF FEAR IN A BEAR. Among wild animals in captivity\r\nhysteria, of the type produced by fear, is fairly common. A case\r\nnoticed particularly on October 16, 1909, in a young female Kadiak\r\nbear, may well be cited as an example.\r\n\r\nThe subject was then about two and one-half years old, and was\r\ncaged in a large open den with four other bears of the same age.\r\nOf a European brown bear male, only a trifle larger than herself,\r\nshe elected to be terror-stricken, as much so as ever a human\r\nchild was in terror of every move of a brutal adult tormentor.\r\nStrangely enough, the cause of all this terror was wholly\r\nunconscious of it, and in the course of an observation lasting at\r\nleast twenty minutes he made not one hostile movement. The greater\r\nportion of the time he idly moved about in the central space of\r\nthe den, wholly oblivious of the alarm he was causing.\r\n\r\nThe young Kadiak, in full flesh and vigor, first attracted my\r\nattention by her angry and terrified snorting, three quick snorts\r\nto the series. On the top of the rocks she raced to and fro,\r\nconstantly eyeing the bear in the centre of the den. If he moved\r\ntoward the rocks, she wildly plunged down, snorting and glaring,\r\nand raced to the front end of the den. If the bogey stopped to\r\nlick up a fallen leaf, she took it as a hostile act and wildly\r\nrushed past him and scrambled up the rocks at the farther end of\r\nthe den. This was repeated about fifteen times in twenty minutes,\r\naccompanied by a continuous series of terrified snorts. She panted\r\nfrom exhaustion, frothed at the mouth, and acted like an animal\r\nhalf crazed by terror.\r\n\r\nNot once, however, did the bogey bear pay the slightest attention\r\nto her, and his sleepy manner was anything but terrifying.\r\n\r\nThese spells of hysteria (without real cause) at last became so\r\nfrequent that they seemed likely to injure the growth of a\r\nvaluable animal, and finally the bogey bear was removed to another\r\nden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\nFIGHTING AMONG WILD ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nQuarrels and combats between wild animals in a state of nature are\r\nalmost invariably due to one of two causes--attack and defense in\r\na struggle for prey, or the jealousy of males during the mating\r\nseason. With rare exceptions, battles of the former class occur\r\nbetween animals of different Orders,--teeth and claws against\r\nhorns and hoofs, for instance; and it is a fight to the death.\r\nHunger forces the aggressor to attack something, and the intended\r\nvictim fights because it is attacked. The question of good or ill\r\ntemper does not enter in. On both sides it is a case of \"must,\"\r\nand neither party has any option. Such combats are tests of\r\nagility, strength, and staying powers, and, in a few cases, of\r\nthickness of bone and hide.\r\n\r\nHow Orang-Utans Fight. Of the comparatively few animals which do\r\ndraw blood of their own kind through ill temper or jealousy, I\r\nhave never encountered any more given to internecine strife than\r\norang-utans. Their fighting methods, and their love of fighting,\r\nare highly suggestive of the temper and actions of the human\r\ntough. They fight by biting, and usually it is the fingers and\r\ntoes that suffer. Of twenty-seven orang-utans I shot in Borneo,\r\nand twelve more that were shot for me by native hunters, five were\r\nfighters, and had had one or more fingers or toes bitten off in\r\nbattle. Those specimens were taken in the days when the museums of\r\nAmerica were one and all destitute of anthropoid apes.\r\n\r\nA gorilla, chimpanzee, or orang-utan, being heavy of body, short\r\nof neck, and by no means nimble footed, cannot spring upon an\r\nadversary, choose a vulnerable spot, and bite to kill; but what it\r\nlacks in agility it makes up in length and strength of arm and\r\nhand. It seizes its antagonist's hand, carries it to its own\r\nmouth, and bites at the fingers. Usually, the bitten finger is\r\nsevered as evenly as by a surgeon's amputation, and heals quite as\r\nsuccessfully.\r\n\r\nI never saw two big orang-utans fighting, but I have had several\r\ncaptive ones seize my arm and try to bring my fingers within\r\nbiting distance. The canine teeth of a full grown male orang,\r\nstanding four feet four inches in height, and weighing a hundred\r\nand fifty pounds or more, are just as large and dangerous as the\r\nteeth of a bear of the same size, and the powerful incisors have\r\none quality which the teeth of a bear do not possess. A bear\r\npierces or tears an antagonist with his canines, but very rarely\r\nbites off anything. An orang-utan bites off a finger as evenly as\r\na boy nips off the end of a stick of candy.\r\n\r\nWhen orang-utans fight, they also attack each other's faces, and\r\noften their broad and expansive lips suffer severely. My eleventh\r\norang bore the scars of many a fierce duel in the tree-tops. A\r\npiece had been bitten out of the middle of both his lips, leaving\r\nin each a large, ragged notch. Both his middle fingers had been\r\ntaken off at the second joint, and his feet had lost the third\r\nright toe, the fourth left toe, and the end of one hallux. His\r\nback, also, had sustained a severe injury, which had retarded his\r\ngrowth. This animal we called \"The Desperado.\"\r\n\r\nOrang No. 34 had lost the entire edge of his upper lip. It had\r\nbeen bitten across diagonally, but adhered at one corner, and\r\nhealed without sloughing off, so that during the last years of his\r\nlife a piece of lip two inches long hung dangling at the corner of\r\nhis mouth. He had also suffered the loss of an entire finger. No.\r\n36 had lost a good sized piece out of his upper lip, and the first\r\ntoe had been bitten off his left foot.\r\n\r\nAll these combats must have taken place in the tree-tops, for an\r\nadult orang-utan has never been known to descend to the earth\r\nexcept for water. In some manner it has become a prevalent\r\nbelief that in their native jungles all three of the great apes--\r\ngorilla, orang, and chimpanzee--are dangerous to human beings, and\r\noften attack them with clubs. Nothing could be farther from the\r\ntruth. According to the natives of West Africa, a gorilla or\r\nchimpanzee fights a hunter by biting his face and fingers, just as\r\nan orang-utan does. I believe that no sane orang ever voluntarily\r\nleft the safety of a tree top to fight at a serious disadvantage\r\non the ground; and I am sure an orang never struck a blow with a\r\nclub, unless carefully taught to do so.\r\n\r\nWILD ANIMALS ARE NOT QUARRELSOME. As a species, man appears to be\r\nthe most quarrelsome animal on the earth; and the same quality is\r\nstrongly reflected in his most impressionable servant and\r\ncompanion, the domestic dog. Nearly all species of wild animals\r\nhave learned the two foundation facts of the philosophy of life--\r\nthat peace is better than war, and that if one must fight, it is\r\nbetter to fight outside one's own species. To this rule, however,\r\nwolves are a notable exception; for wherever wolves are abundant a\r\nwounded wolf is a subject for attack, and usually it is killed and\r\neaten by the other members of the pack.\r\n\r\nI have observed the daily habits of many kinds of wild animals in\r\ntheir wild haunts, but in the field I never yet have seen either a\r\nfight between animals of the same species, or between two of\r\ndifferent species. This may seem a very humiliating admission for\r\na hunter to make, but it happens to be true. In the matter of\r\nfinding big snakes, having exciting adventures, and witnessing\r\ncombats between wild animals, there are some men who never are in\r\nluck.\r\n\r\nNow there was the \"Old Shekarry,\"--whose elephants, tigers, bison,\r\nbears, and sambar always were so much larger than mine. In his\r\nbook, \"Sport in Many Lands,\" he describes an affair of honor\r\nbetween a tiger and a bull bison, which was a truly ideal combat.\r\nThe champions met by appointment,--by the light of the moon, in\r\norder to be safe from interference by the jungle police,--and they\r\nfought round after round, in the most orthodox prize ring style,\r\nunder the Queensberry rules. So fairly did they fight that neither\r\nclaimed a foul, and at the finish the two combatants retired to\r\ntheir respective corners and died simultaneously, \"to the musical\r\ntwitter of the night bird.\"\r\n\r\nAnother writer has given a vivid description of a battle to the\r\ndeath between a wild bull and a grizzly bear; and we have read of\r\nseveral awful combats between black bears and alligators, in\r\nFlorida; but some of us have yet to find either a black bear or an\r\nalligator that will stop to fight when he has an option on a line\r\nof retreat. When he has lived long,--say to the length of twelve\r\nfeet,--the alligator is a hideous and terrorizing beast; but, for\r\nall that, he knows a thing or two; and a full grown, healthy black\r\nbear of active habit is about the last creature on earth that a\r\n'gator would care to meddle with. Pigs and calves, fawns, stray\r\ndogs, ducks and mud hens are antagonists more to his liking.\r\n\r\nThe Fighting Tactics of Bears. In captivity, bears quarrel and\r\nscold one another freely, at feeding time, but seldom draw blood.\r\nI have questioned many old hunters, and read many books by bear\r\nhunters, but Ira Dodge, of Wyoming, is the only man I know who has\r\nwitnessed a real fight between wild bears. He once saw a battle\r\nbetween a cinnamon and a grizzly over the carcass of an elk.\r\n\r\nIn attacking, a bear does three things, and usually in the same\r\norder. First, he delivers a sweeping sidewise blow on the head of\r\nhis antagonist; then he seizes him by the cheek, with the\r\nintention of shifting to the throat as quickly as it is safe to do\r\nso. His third move consists in throwing his weight upon his foe\r\nand bearing him to the earth, where he will have a better chance\r\nat his throat. If the fighters are fairly matched, the struggle is\r\nhead to head and mouth to mouth. After the first onset, the paws\r\ndo little or no damage, and the attacks of the teeth rarely go as\r\nfar down as the shoulders. Often the assailant will seize his\r\nopponent's cheek and hold on so firmly that for a full minute the\r\nother can do nothing; but this means little.\r\n\r\nIn combats between bears, the one that is getting mauled, or that\r\nfeels outclassed, will throw himself upon the ground, flat upon\r\nhis back, and proceed to fight with all four sets of claws in\r\naddition to his teeth. This attitude is purely defensive, and\r\noften is maintained until an opportunity occurs to attack with\r\ngood advantage, or to escape. It is very difficult for a standing\r\nbear to make a serious impression upon an antagonist who lies upon\r\nhis back, clawing vigorously with all four feet at the head of his\r\nassailant.\r\n\r\nTiger Versus Grizzly Bear. Often is the question asked, \"If a\r\ngrizzly bear and a tiger should fight, which would whip the\r\nother?\" One can answer only with opinions and deductions, not by\r\nreference to the records of the ring; for it seems that the\r\nterrors of the occident and the orient have never yet been matched\r\nin a fight to a finish.\r\n\r\nOne of the heaviest tigers ever weighed, prior to 1878, scaled\r\nfour hundred and ninety five pounds, and was as free from surplus\r\nflesh and fat as a prizefighter in the ring. He stood three feet\r\nseven inches at the shoulder, measured thirty-six inches around\r\nthe jaws, and twenty inches around the forearm. Very few lions\r\nhave ever exceeded his weight or dimensions. So far as I know, a\r\nwild grizzly bear of the largest size has never been scaled, but\r\nit is not at all certain that any California grizzly has weighed\r\nmore than twelve hundred pounds. The silvertip of the Rocky\r\nMountain region is a totally different animal, being smaller, as\r\nwell as different in color.\r\n\r\nIn a match between a grizzly and a tiger of equal weights, the\r\nactivity of the latter, combined with the greater spread of his\r\njaws and length of his canine teeth, would insure him the victory.\r\nThe superior attack of the tiger would give him an advantage which\r\nit would probably be impossible to overcome. The blow of a\r\ntiger's paw is as powerful as that of a grizzly of the same size,\r\nthough I doubt if it is any quicker in delivery. The quickness\r\nwith which a seemingly clumsy bear can deliver a smashing blow is\r\nastonishing. Moreover, nature has given the grizzly a coat of fur\r\nwhich as a protection in fighting is almost equal to chain mail.\r\nIts length, combined with its density, makes it difficult for\r\nteeth or claws to cut through it, and in a struggle with a tiger,\r\nprotective fur is only a fair compensation for a serious lack of\r\nleaping power in the hinder limbs. Though the tiger would win at\r\nequal weights, it is extremely probable that an adult California\r\ngrizzly would vanquish a tiger of the largest size, for his\r\ngreater bulk would far outweigh the latter's agility.\r\n\r\nThe Great Cats as Fighters. Tigers, when well matched, fight head\r\nto head and mouth to mouth, as do nearly all other carnivora, and\r\nat the same time they strike with their front paws. One of the\r\nfinest spectacles I ever witnessed was a pitched battle between\r\ntwo splendid tigers, in a cage which afforded them ample room.\r\nWith loud, roaring coughs, they sprang together, ears laid tight\r\nto their heads, eyes closed until only sparks of green and yellow\r\nfire flashed through four narrow slits, and their upper lips\r\nsnarling high up to clear the glittering fangs beneath. Coughing,\r\nsnarling, and often roaring furiously, each sprang for the\r\nother's throat, but jaw met jaw until their teeth almost cracked\r\ntogether. They rose fully erect on their hind legs, with their\r\nheads seven feet high, stood there, and smashed away with their\r\npaws, while tufts of hair flew through the air, and the cage\r\nseemed full of sparks. Neither gave the other a chance to get the\r\nthroat hold, nor indeed to do aught else than ward off calamity;\r\nand each face was a picture of fury.\r\n\r\nThis startling combat lasted a surprisingly long time, without\r\nnoticeable advantage to either side. Finally the tigers backed\r\naway from each other, and when at a safe distance apart dropped\r\ntheir front feet to the floor, growling savagely and licking their\r\nlips wherever a claw had drawn blood.\r\n\r\nOf all the wild animals that are preyed upon by lions, tigers,\r\nleopards, jaguars, and pumas, only half a dozen species do\r\nanything more than struggle to escape. The gaur and the wild\r\nbuffalo of India are sufficiently vindictive in dealing with a\r\nhuman hunter whose aim is not straight, but both fly before the\r\ntiger, and count themselves lucky when they can escape with\r\nnothing worse to show than a collection of long slits on their\r\nsides and hind quarters made by his knife-like claws. They do not\r\ncare to return to do battle for the sake of revenge, and seek to\r\nput the widest possible stretch of jungle between themselves and\r\ntheir dreaded enemy.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of the African buffalo and the lion. As to the\r\nantelopes of Africa and the deer of India, what can they do but\r\nmake a desperate effort to escape, and fly like the wind whenever\r\nthey succeed? Of course many of these defenseless animals make a\r\ngallant struggle for their lives, and not a few succeed in\r\nthrowing off their assailants and escaping. Even domestic cattle\r\nsometimes return to the hill country villages of southern India\r\nbearing claw marks on their sides--usually the work of young\r\ntigers, or of rheumatic old ones.\r\n\r\nHere is a deer and puma story. In the picturesque bad-lands of\r\nHell Creek, Montana, I saw my comrade, Laton A. Huffman, kill a\r\nlarge mule deer buck that three months previously had been\r\nattacked by a puma. From above it, the great cat had leaped upon\r\nthe back of the deer, and laid hold with teeth and claws. In its\r\nstruggle for life the buck either leaped or fell off the edge of a\r\nperpendicular \"cut bank,\" and landed upon its back, with the puma\r\nunderneath. Evidently the puma was so seriously injured that it\r\ncould not continue the struggle; but it surely left its ear-marks.\r\n\r\nOne ear of the buck was fearfully torn. There was a big wound on\r\nthe top of the neck, where the puma jaws had lacerated the skin\r\nand flesh; and both hind legs had been badly clawed by the\r\nassailant's hind feet. The main beam of the right antler had been,\r\nbroken off half-way up, while the antlers were still in the\r\nvelvet, which enabled us to fix the probable date of the\r\nencounter.\r\n\r\nIn the great Wynaad forest I once got lost, and in toiling through\r\na five acre patch of grass higher than my head, and so dense that\r\nit was not negotiable except by following the game trails, my\r\nsimple old Kuramber and I came suddenly upon the scene of a great\r\nstruggle. In the center of a space about twenty feet in diameter,\r\non which the tall grass had been trampled flat, lay the remains of\r\na sambar stag which had very recently been killed and eaten by a\r\ntiger. The neck had not been dislocated, and the sambar had fought\r\nlong and hard. Evidently the tiger had lain in wait on the runway,\r\nand had failed to subdue the sambar by his first fierce onslaught.\r\nNow an angry stag with good antlers is no mean antagonist, and it\r\nis strange if the tiger in the case went through that struggle\r\nwithout a puncture in his tawny skin.\r\n\r\nIn South Africa, Vaughan Kirby once found the dead bodies of a\r\n\"patriarchal bull\" sable antelope and a lion, \"which had evidently\r\nbeen a fine specimen,\" lying close together, where the two\r\nanimals had fallen after a great struggle. The sable antelope must\r\nhave killed its antagonist by a lucky backward thrust of its long,\r\ncurved horns as the lion fastened upon its back to pull it down.\r\n\r\nMr. Kirby's dogs once disturbed a sanguinary struggle between a\r\nleopard and a wild boar, or \"bush pig,\" which had well-nigh\r\nreached a finish. The old boar, when bayed by the dogs, was found\r\nto be most terribly mauled. Its tough skin hung literally in\r\nshreds from its neck and shoulders, presenting ghastly open\r\nwounds. The entrails protruded from a deep claw gash in the side,\r\nand the head was a mass of blood and dirt. \"On searching around,\"\r\nsays Mr. Kirby, \"we found unmistakable evidence of a life and\r\ndeath struggle. The ground was covered with gouts of blood and\r\nyellow hair, to some of which the skin (of the leopard) was still\r\nattached. Blood was splashed plentifully on the tree stems and the\r\nlow brushwood, which for a space of a dozen yards around was\r\ntrampled flat.\" The leopard had fled upon the approach of the\r\ndogs, leaving a trail of blood, which, though followed quickly,\r\nwas finally lost in bad ground. It is no wonder that from the\r\nabove and many other evidences equally good, Mr. Kirby considers\r\nthe bush pig a remarkably courageous animal. He says that it was\r\n\"never yet known to show the white feather,\" and declares that \"a\r\npig is never defeated until he is dead.\"\r\n\r\nThe Combats of Male Deer. The sable antelope is one of the few\r\nexceptions to the well-nigh universal rule against fighting\r\nbetween wild animals of the same species. Of this species, Mr.\r\nKirby says: \"Sable antelope bulls fight most fiercely amongst\r\nthemselves, and though I have never actually witnessed an\r\nencounter between them, I have often seen the results of such,\r\nevidenced by great gaping wounds that could have been made by\r\nnothing else than the horns of an opponent. I once killed a large\r\nbull with a piece of another's horn tip, fully three inches long,\r\nburied in its neck. In 1889 I shot an old bull on the Swinya with\r\na terrible wound in its off shoulder, caused by a horn thrust.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the jealous flashes of the mating season, the males of\r\nseveral species of deer fight savagely. After a long period of\r\ninaction while the new antlers are developing--from April to\r\nSeptember--the beginning of October finds the male deer, elk, or\r\nmoose of North America with a new suit of hair, new horns, a\r\nswollen neck, and all his usual assertiveness. The crisp autumn\r\nair promotes a disposition to fight something, precisely as it\r\ninspires a sportsman to \"kill something.\" During October and\r\nNovember, particularly, it is well for an unarmed man to give\r\nevery antlered deer a wide berth.\r\n\r\nAt this period, fights between the males of herds of mule deer,\r\nwhite-tailed deer and elk are of frequent occurrence, but in a\r\nwild state they rarely end in bloodshed or death, save from locked\r\nantlers. Many times, however, two bucks will come together, and\r\nplayfully push each other about without being angry. Many pairs of\r\nbucks have been found with their antlers fast locked in death--and\r\nI never see a death lock without a feeling of grim satisfaction\r\nthat neither of the quarrelsome brutes had had an opportunity to\r\nattack some defenseless man, and spear him to death.\r\n\r\nThe antlers of the common white-tailed deer seem peculiarly\r\nliable to become interlocked so tightly that it is well-nigh\r\nimpossible to separate them. And whenever this happens, the doom\r\nof both deer is sealed. Unless found speedily and killed, they\r\nmust die of starvation. While it is quite true that two deer\r\nplaying with their antlers may become locked fast, it is safe to\r\nsay that the great majority meet their fate by charging each other\r\nwith force sufficient to spring the beams of their antlers, and\r\nmake the lock so perfect that no force they can exert will release\r\nit. A deer cannot pull back with the same power it exerts in\r\nplunging forward.\r\n\r\nAll members of the deer family that I know follow the same natural\r\nlaw in regard to supremacy. Indeed, this is true of nearly all\r\nanimals. Leadership is not always maintained by the largest and\r\nstrongest member of a herd, but very often by the most pugnacious.\r\nSometimes a herd of elk is completely tyrannized by an old doe,\r\nwho makes the young bucks fly from her in terror, when one prod of\r\ntheir sharp antlers would quickly send her to the rear.\r\n\r\nWhen bucks in a state of freedom fight for supremacy, the weaker\r\ndoes not stay to be overthrown and speared to death by the victor.\r\nAs soon as he feels that he is mastered he releases his antlers at\r\nthe first opportunity, flings himself to one side, and either\r\nremains in the herd as an acknowledged subject of the victor, or\r\nelse seeks fresh fields and pastures new.\r\n\r\nBattles in Zoological Parks. In captivity, where escape is\r\nimpossible, it is no uncommon thing for elk to kill each other.\r\nIn fact, with several adult males in a small enclosure, tragedies\r\nmay always be expected in the autumn and early winter. The process\r\nis very simple. So long as the two elk can stand up and fight head\r\nto head, there are no casualties; but when one wearies and weakens\r\nbefore the other, its guard is broken. Then one strong thrust in\r\nits side or shoulder sends it to the earth, badly wounded; and\r\nbefore it can rise, it is generally stabbed to death with horn\r\nthrusts into its lungs and liver. But, as I said before, I have\r\nnever known of a fatal duel between elk outside of a zoological\r\ngarden or park.\r\n\r\nOne of the most novel and interesting fights that has yet taken\r\nplace in the New York Zoological Park was a pitched battle between\r\ntwo cow elk--May Queen and the Dowager. A bunch of black fungus\r\nsuddenly appeared on the trunk of a tree, about twelve feet from\r\nthe ground. My attention was first called to this by seeing May\r\nQueen, a fine young cow, standing erect on her hind legs in order\r\nto reach the tempting morsel with her mouth. A little later the\r\nDowager, the oldest and largest cow elk in the herd, met her under\r\nthe tree, whereupon the two made wry faces at each other, and\r\nchamped their teeth together threateningly. Suddenly both cows\r\nrose on their hind legs, struck out viciously with their sharp\r\npointed front hoofs, and, after a lively sparring bout, they\r\nactually clinched. The young cow got both front legs of the old\r\ncow between her own, where they were held practically helpless,\r\nand then with her own front hoofs she fiercely rained blows upon\r\nthe ribs of her assailant. The Dowager backed away and fled,\r\ncompletely vanquished, with May Queen close upon her heels; and\r\nthus was the tyrannical rule of the senior cow overthrown forever.\r\n\r\nDuring the breeding season, our wild buffaloes of the great\r\nvanished herds were much given to fighting, and always through\r\njealousy. The bulls bellowed until they could be heard for miles,\r\ntore up earth and threw it into the air, rolled their eyes, and\r\noften rushed together in a terrifying manner; but beyond butting\r\ntheir heads, pushing and straining until the weaker turned and\r\nran, nothing came of it all. I have yet to find a man who ever saw\r\na wild buffalo that had been wounded to the shedding of blood by\r\nanother wild buffalo. It is probable that no other species ever\r\nfought so fiercely and did so little damage as the American bison.\r\n\r\nElephants, Wolves, and Others. In ordinary life the Indian\r\nelephant is one of the most even-tempered of all animals. I have\r\nspent hours in watching wild herds in southern India, sometimes\r\nfinding the huge beasts all around me, and in dangerously close\r\nproximity. Several times I could have touched a wild elephant with\r\na carriage whip, had I possessed one. So far from fighting, I\r\nnever saw an elephant threaten or even annoy another.\r\n\r\nElephants, being the most intelligent of all animals in the matter\r\nof training, have been educated to fight in the arena, usually by\r\npushing each other head to head. A fighting tusker can lord it\r\nover almost any number of tuskless elephants, because he can\r\npierce their vitals, and they cannot pierce his. A female fights\r\nby hitting with her head, striking her antagonist amidships, if\r\npossible. Once when the late G. P. Sanderson was in a keddah,\r\nnoosing wild elephants, and was assulted [sic] by a vicious\r\ntusker, his life was saved by a tame female elephant, whose boy\r\ndriver caused her to attack the tusker with her head, and nearly\r\nbowl him over by the force of her blows upon his ribs.\r\n\r\nIn captivity, wolves are the meanest brutes on earth, and in a\r\nwild state they are no better. As a rule, the stronger ones are\r\never ready to kill the weaker ones, and eat them, too. One night,\r\nour male Russian wolf killed his mate, and ate nearly half of her\r\nbefore morning. A fox or a wolf cub which thrusts one of its legs\r\nbetween the partition bars and into a wolf's den almost invariably\r\ngets it bitten off as close to the body as the biter can go. In\r\nthe arctic regions, north of the Great Slave Lake, \"Buffalo\" Jones\r\nand George Rea fought wolves incessantly for several days, and\r\nevery wolf they wounded was immediately killed and devoured by its\r\npack mates.\r\n\r\nIn captivity, a large proportion of mammals fight, more or less;\r\nand the closer the confinement, the greater their nervousness and\r\nirritability, and the more fighting. Monkeys fight freely and\r\nfrequently. Serpents, lizards, and alligators rarely do, although\r\nlarge alligators are prone to bite off the tails or legs of their\r\nsmall companions, or even to devour them whole. Storks, trumpeter\r\nswans, darters, jays, and some herons are so quarrelsome and\r\ndangerous that they must be kept well separated from other\r\nspecies, to prevent mutilation and murder. In 1900, when a pair of\r\ntrumpeter swans were put upon a lake in Prospect Park, Brooklyn,\r\nwith three brown pelicans for associates, they promptly assailed\r\nthe pelicans, dug holes in their backs, and killed all three. The\r\ncommon red squirrel is a persistent fighter of the gray species,\r\nand, although inferior in size, nearly always wins.\r\n\r\nA Fight Between a Whale and a Swordfish. One of the strangest wild\r\nanimal combats on record was thus described in the Proceedings of\r\nthe Zoological Society of London, for 1909.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Malcolm Maclaren, through Mr. C. Davies Sherborn, F. Z. S.,\r\ncalled the attention of the Fellows to an account of a fight\r\nbetween a whale and a swordfish observed by the crew of the\r\nfishing-boat 'Daisy' in the Hauraki Gulf, between Ponui Island and\r\nCoromandel, as reported in the 'Auckland Weekly News,' 19th Nov.,\r\n1908. A cow whale and her calf were attacked by a 12 ft. 6 in.\r\nswordfish, the object of the fish being the calf. The whale\r\nplunged about and struck in all directions with her flukes.\r\nOccasionally the fins of the swordfish were seen as he rose from a\r\ndive, his object apparently being to strike from below. For over\r\na quarter of an hour the whale circled round her calf, lashing\r\nfuriously and churning up the water so that the assailant was\r\nunable to secure a good opportunity for a thrust. At last, after\r\na fruitless dive, the swordfish came close up and made a thrust at\r\nthe calf, but received a blow from the whale's flukes across the\r\nback, which apparently paralyzed it. It was killed and hauled on\r\nboard the boat without difficulty, while the whale and calf went\r\noff towards Coromandel with splashings and plungings. The whale's\r\nblow had almost knocked off the back fin of the swordfish, and\r\nheavily bruised the flesh around it. No threshers accompanied the\r\nswordfish.\"\r\n\r\nBeyond question, as firearms and hunters multiply, all wild\r\nanimals become more timid, less inclined to attack man, and also\r\nless inclined to attack one another. The higher creatures are the\r\nmost affected by man's destructiveness of animal life, and the\r\nstruggle for existence has become so keen that fighting for the\r\nglory of supremacy, or as a pastime, will soon have no important\r\nplace in the lives of wild animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\nWILD ANIMAL CRIMINALS AND CRIME\r\n\r\n\r\nMany human beings are \"good\" because they never have been under\r\nthe harrow of circumstances, nor sufficiently tempted to do wrong.\r\nIt is only under the strain of strong temptation that human\r\ncharacter is put through the thirty-third degree and tried out. No\r\ndoubt a great many of us could be provoked to join a mob for\r\nmurder, or forced to steal, or tortured into homicidal insanity.\r\nIt is only under the artificial conditions of captivity, with loss\r\nof freedom, exemption from the daily fear of death, abundant food\r\nwithout compensating labor, and with every want supplied, that the\r\nlatent wickedness of wild creatures comes to the surface. A\r\ncaptive animal often reveals traits never recognized in the free\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\n\"Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do.\"\r\n\r\nThese manifestations are of many kinds; but we propose to consider\r\nthe criminal tendencies of wild animals both free and captive.\r\n\r\nThe persistence of the mental and moral parallelism between men\r\nand wild animals is a source of constant surprise. In a state of\r\nfreedom, untrammeled by anything save the fear of death by\r\nviolence, the deer or the mountain sheep works out in his own way\r\nhis chosen scheme for the survival of the fittest,--himself. In\r\nthe wilds we see very few manifestations of the criminal instinct.\r\nA fight between wild elk bulls for the supremacy of a herd is not\r\na manifestation of murder lust, but of obedience to the\r\nfundamental law of evolution that the largest, the strongest\r\nand the most courageous males of every herd shall do the breeding.\r\nThe killing of natural prey for daily food is not murder. A\r\nstarving wolf on the desolate barren grounds may even kill and\r\ndevour a wounded pack-mate without becoming a criminal by that act\r\nalone. True, such a manifestation of hard-heartedness and bad\r\ntaste is very reprehensible; but its cause is hunger, not sheer\r\nblackness of heart. Among wild animals, the wanton killing of a\r\nmember of the killer's own species would constitute murder in the\r\nfirst degree, and so is all unnecessary and wanton killing outside\r\nthe killer's own species.\r\n\r\nTo many a wild animal there comes at tunes the murder lust which\r\nunder the spur of opportunity leads to genuine crime. In some of\r\nthe many cases that have come under my notice, the desire to\r\ncommit murder for the sake of murder has been as sharply defined\r\nas the fangs or horns of the criminal. Of the many emotions of\r\nwild animals which are revealed more sharply in captivity than in\r\na state of nature, the crime-producing passions, of jealousy,\r\nhatred, desire for revenge, and devilish lust for innocent blood,\r\nare most prominent. In the management of large animals in\r\ncaptivity, the criminal instinct is quite as great a trouble-\r\nbreeder and source of anxiety as are wild-animal diseases, and the\r\nconstant struggle with the elements.\r\n\r\nIn many cases there is not the slightest premonitory manifestation\r\nof murderous intent on the part of a potential criminal. Indeed,\r\nwith most cunning wisdom, a wild-animal murderer will often\r\nconceal his purpose until outside interference is an\r\nimpossibility, and the victim is entirely helpless. These\r\nmanifestations of fiendish cunning and premeditation are very\r\nexasperating to those responsible for the care of animals in\r\ncaptivity.\r\n\r\nIn every well regulated zoological park, solitary confinement is\r\nregarded as an unhappy or intolerable condition. Animals that live\r\nin herds and groups in large enclosures always exercise more, have\r\nbetter appetites, and are much more contented and happy than\r\nindividuals that are singly confined.\r\n\r\nTo visitors, a happy and contented community of deer, antelopes,\r\nbears, wolves, or birds is a source of far more mental\r\nsatisfaction than could be found in any number of solitary\r\nanimals. A small pen with a solitary animal in it at once suggests\r\nthe prison-and-prisoner idea, and sometimes arouses pity and\r\ncompassion rather than pleased admiration. The peaceful herd or\r\nflock is the thing to strive for as the highest ideal attainable\r\nin an exhibition of wild animals. But mark well the difficulties.\r\n\r\n_All the obstacles encountered in carrying out the community\r\nidea are created by the evil propensities of the animals\r\nthemselves._ Among the hoofed animals generally, every pair of\r\nhorns and front hoofs is a possible storm-center. No keeper knows\r\nwhether the members of his herd of deer will live together in\r\npeace and contentment until tomorrow, or whether, on any autumn or\r\nwinter night, a buck will suddenly develop in his antlered head\r\nthe thought that it is a good time to \"kill something.\"\r\n\r\nIn the pairing season we always watch for trouble, and the danger\r\nsignal always is up. In October a male elk may become ever so\r\nsavage, and finally develop into a raging demon, dangerous to man\r\nand beast; but when he first manifests his new temper openly and\r\nin the broad light of day, we feel that he is treating fairly both\r\nhis herd-mates and his keepers. If he gives fair warning to the\r\nworld about him, we must not class him as a mean criminal, no\r\nmatter what he may do later on. It is our duty to corral him at\r\nnight according to the violence of his rage. If we separate him\r\nfrom the herd, and he tears a fence in pieces and kills his rival,\r\nthat is honest, open warfare, not foul murder. But take the\r\nfollowing case.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1905, the New York Zoological Park received from the\r\nstate of Washington a young mule deer buck and two does. Being\r\nconspicuous members of the worst species of \"difficult\" deer to\r\nkeep alive at Atlantic tidewater, and being also very thin and\r\nweak, it required the combined efforts of several persons to keep\r\nthem alive. For six months they moped about their corral, but at\r\nlast they began to improve. The oldest doe gave birth to two fawns\r\nwhich actually survived. But, even when the next mating season\r\nbegan, the buck continued to be lanquid and blase. At no time did\r\nhe exhibit signs of temper, of even suspicious vigor.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the night of November 6, 1906, without the\r\nslightest warning, he decided to commit a murder, and the mother\r\nof the two nursing fawns was selected as the victim. Being weak\r\nfrom the rearing of her offspring, she was at his mercy. He gored\r\nher most savagely, about twenty times, and killed her.\r\n\r\nThat was deliberate, fiendish and cowardly murder. The killing of\r\nany female animal by her male consort is murder; but there are\r\ncircumstances wherein the plea of temporary insanity is an\r\nadmissible defense. In the autumn, male members of the deer\r\nfamily _often become temporarily insane and irresponsible,_\r\nand should be judged accordingly. With us, sexual insanity is a\r\nrecognized disease.\r\n\r\nSuch distressing cases as the above are so common that whenever I\r\ngo deer-hunting and kill a lusty buck, the thought occurs to me,--\r\n\"another undeveloped murderer, perhaps!\"\r\n\r\nThe most exasperating thing about these corral murders is the\r\ncunning treachery of the murderers. Here is another typical case:\r\nFor three years a dainty little male Osceola deer from Florida was\r\nas gentle as a fawn and as harmless as a dove. But one crisp\r\nmorning Keeper Quinn, to whom every doe in his charge is like a\r\nfoster-daughter, was horrified at finding blood on the absurd\r\nlittle antlers of the Osceola pet. One of the females lay dead in\r\na dark corner where she had been murdered during the night; and\r\nthis with another and older buck in the same corral which might\r\nfairly have been regarded as an offensive rival.\r\n\r\nThe desire to murder for the sake of killing is born in some\r\ncarnivorous animals, and by others it is achieved. Among the\r\nlargest and finest of the felines, the lions and tigers, midnight\r\nmurders very rarely occur. We never have known one. Individual\r\ndislike is shown boldly and openly, and we are given a fair chance\r\nto prevent fatalities. Among the lions, tigers, leopards, jaguars\r\nand pumas of the New York Zoological Park, there has been but one\r\nmurder. That was the crime of Lopez, the big jaguar, who richly\r\ndeserved instant death as a punishment. It was one of the most\r\ncunning crimes I have ever seen among wild animals, and is now\r\nhistoric.\r\n\r\nFor a year Lopez _pretended,_ ostentatiously, to be a good-\r\nnatured animal! Twenty times at least he acted the part of a\r\nplayful pet, inviting me to reach in and stroke him. At last we\r\ndecided to give him a cage-mate, and a fine adult female jaguar\r\nwas purchased. The animals actually tried to caress each other\r\nthrough the bars, and the big male completely deceived us, one and\r\nall.\r\n\r\nAt the end of two days it was considered safe to permit the female\r\njaguar to enter the cage of Lopez. She was just as much deceived\r\nas we were. An animal that is afraid always leaves its traveling-\r\ncage slowly and unwillingly, or refuses to leave it at all. When\r\nthe two sets of doors were opened, the female joyously walked into\r\nthe cage of her treacherous admirer. In an instant, Lopez rushed\r\nupon her, seized her whole neck in his powerful jaws, and crushed\r\nher cervical vertebrae by his awful bite. We beat him over the\r\nhead; we spiked him; we even tried to brain him; but he held her,\r\nas a bull-dog would hold a cat, until she was dead. He had\r\ndetermined to murder her, but had cunningly concealed his purpose\r\nuntil his victim was fully in his power.\r\n\r\nBears usually fight \"on the square,\" openly and above-board,\r\nrarely committing foul murder. If one bear hates another, he\r\nattacks at the very first opportunity, He does not cunningly wait\r\nto catch the offender at a disadvantage and beyond the possibility\r\nof rescue. Sometimes a captive bear kills a cage-mate or mauls a\r\nkeeper, but not by the sneaking methods of the human assassin who\r\nshoots in the dark and runs away.\r\n\r\nI do not count the bear as a common criminal, even though at rare\r\nintervals he kills a cage-mate smaller and weaker than himself.\r\nOne killing of that kind, done by Cinnamon Jim to a small black\r\nbear that had annoyed him beyond all endurance, was inflicted as a\r\nlegitimate punishment, and was so recorded. The attack of two\r\nlarge bears, a Syrian and a sloth bear, upon a small Japanese\r\nblack bear, in which the big pair deliberately attempted to\r\ndisembowel the small victim, biting him only in the abdomen,\r\nalways has been a puzzle to me. I cannot fathom the idea which\r\npossessed those two ursine minds; but I have no doubt that some of\r\nthe book-making men who read the minds of wild animals as if they\r\nwere open books could tell me all about it.\r\n\r\nOn the ice-pack in front of his stone hut at the north end of the\r\nFranz Josef Archipelago Nansen saw an occurrence that was plain\r\nmurder. A large male polar bear feeding upon a dead walrus was\r\napproached across the ice-pack by two polar-bear cubs. The\r\ngorging male immediately stopped feeding and rushed toward the\r\nsmall intruders. They turned and fled wildly; but the villain\r\npursued them, far out upon the ice. He overtook them, killed both,\r\nand then serenely returned to his solitary feast.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1907, a tragedy occurred in the Zoological Park which\r\nwas a close parallel of the Lopez murder. It was a case in which\r\nmy only crumb of satisfaction was in my ability to say, \"I told\r\nyou so,\"--than which no consolation can be more barren.\r\n\r\nFor seven years there had lived together in the great polar bears'\r\nden of the Zoological Park two full-grown, very large and fine\r\npolar bears. They came from William Hagenbeck's great group, and\r\nboth were males. Their rough-and-tumble wrestling, both in the\r\nswimming pool and out of it, was a sight of almost perennial\r\ninterest; and while their biting and boxing was of the roughest\r\ncharacter, and frequently drew blood, they never got angry, and\r\nnever had a real fight.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1906 one of the animals sickened and died, and\r\npresently the impression prevailed that the survivor was lonesome.\r\nThe desirability of introducing a female companion was spoken of,\r\nbut I was afraid to try the experiment.\r\n\r\nBy and by, Mr. Carl Hagenbeck, who had handled about forty polar\r\nbears to my one, wrote to us, offering a fine female polar as a\r\nmate to the survivor. She was conceded to be one-third smaller\r\nthan the big male, but was fully adult. Without loss of time I\r\nanswered, declining to make the purchase, on the ground that our\r\nmale bear would kill the female. It was my belief that even if he\r\ndid not at once deliberately murder her, he soon would wear her\r\nout by his rough play.\r\n\r\nMr. Hagenbeck replied with the assurance that, in his opinion, all\r\nwould be well; that, instead of a tragedy taking place, the male\r\nwould be delighted with a female companion, and that the pair\r\nwould breed. As convincing proof of the sincerity of his views,\r\nMr. Hagenbeck offered to lose half the purchase price of the\r\nfemale bear in the event that my worst fears were realized.\r\n\r\nI asked the opinion of our head keeper of bears, and after due\r\nreflection he said:\r\n\r\n\"Why, no; I don't believe he'd kill her. He's not a _bad_\r\nbear at all. I think we could work it so that there would be no\r\ngreat trouble.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hagenbeck's son also felt sure there would be no tragedy.\r\n\r\nQuite against my own judgment of polar-bear character, but in\r\ndeference to the expert opinion arrayed against mine, I finally\r\nyielded. The female bear was purchased, and on her arrival she was\r\nplaced for three weeks in the large shifting-cage which connects\r\nwith the eastern side of the great polar bears' den.\r\n\r\nThe two animals seemed glad to see each other. At once they\r\nfraternized through the bars, licked each other's noses, and ate\r\ntheir meals side by side. At night the male always slept as near\r\nas possible to his new companion. There was not a sign of ill\r\ntemper; but, for all that, my doubts were ever present.\r\n\r\nAt last, after three full weeks of close acquaintance, it was\r\nagreed that there was nothing to be gained by longer delay in\r\nadmitting the female to the large den. But we made preparations\r\nfor trouble. The door of the sleeping-den was oiled and overhauled\r\nand put in thorough working order, so that if the female should\r\ndash into it for safety, a keeper could instantly slide the\r\nbarrier and shut her in. We provided pike-poles, long iron bars,\r\nlariats, meat, and long planks a foot wide. Heartily wishing\r\nmyself a hundred miles away, I summoned all my courage and gave\r\nthe order:\r\n\r\n\"Open her door, a foot only, and let her put her head out. Keep\r\nhim away.\"\r\n\r\nThe female bear had not the slightest fear or premonition of\r\ndanger. Thrusting her head through the narrow opening, she looked\r\nupon the world and the open sky above, and found that it was good.\r\nShe struggled to force the door open wider; and the male stood\r\nback, waiting.\r\n\r\n\"Let her go!\" Forcing the door back with her own eager strength,\r\nshe fearlessly dropped the intervening eighteen inches to the\r\nfloor of the den, and was free. The very _next second_ the\r\nmale flung his great bulk upon her, and the tragedy was on.\r\n\r\nI would not for five thousand dollars see such a thing again. A\r\nhundred times in the twenty minutes that followed I bitterly\r\nregretted my folly in acting contrary to my own carefully formed\r\nconclusions regarding the temper, the strength, and the mental\r\nprocesses of that male bear.\r\n\r\nHe never left her alone for ten seconds, save when, at five or six\r\ndifferent times, we beat him off by literally ramming him away.\r\nWhen she first fell, the slope of the floor brought her near the\r\ncage bars, which gave us a chance to fight for her. We beat him\r\nover the head; we drove big steel spikes into him; and we rammed\r\nhim with planks, not caring how many bones we might break. But\r\neach time that we beat him off, and the poor harried female rose\r\nto her feet, he flung himself upon her anew, crushed her down upon\r\nthe snow, and fought to reach her throat!\r\n\r\nGallantly the female fought for her life, with six wild men to\r\nhelp her. After a long battle,--it seemed like hours, but I\r\nsuppose it was between twenty and thirty minutes, the male bear\r\nrecognized the fact that so long as the female lay near the bars\r\nhis own punishment would continue and the end would be postponed.\r\nForthwith he seized his victim and dragged her inward and down to\r\nthe ice that covered the swimming-pool in the centre of the den,\r\nbeyond our reach. The floor of the den was so slippery from ice\r\nand snow that it was utterly unsafe for any of our men to enter\r\nand try to approach the now furious animal within striking\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nVery quickly some choice pieces of fresh meat were thrown within\r\nsix feet of the bears, in the hope that the male would be tempted\r\naway from his victim. In vain! Then, with all possible haste,\r\nKeeper Mulvehill coiled a lasso, bravely entered the den, and with\r\nthe first throw landed the noose neatly around the neck of the\r\nmale bear. In a second it was jerked taut, the end passed through\r\nthe bars, and ten eager arms dragged the big bear away from his\r\nvictim and close up to the bars. Another lariat was put on him to\r\nguard against breakages, and no bear ever missed being choked to\r\ndeath by a narrower margin than did that one. That morsel of\r\nrevenge was sweet. While he was held thus, two men went in and\r\nattached a rope to the now dying female, and she was quickly\r\ndragged into the shifting-cage.\r\n\r\nBut the rescue came too late. At the last moment on the ice, the\r\ncanine teeth of the big bear had severed the jugular vein of the\r\nfemale, and in two minutes after her rescue she was dead. It is\r\nmy belief that at first the male did not intend to murder the\r\nfemale. I think his first impulse was to play with her, as he had\r\nalways done with the male comrade of his own size. But the _joy\r\nof combat_ seized him, and after that his only purpose was to\r\nkill. My verdict was, not premeditated murder, but murder in the\r\nsecond degree.\r\n\r\nIn the order of carnivorous animals, I think the worst criminals\r\nare found in the Marten Family (_Mustelidae_); and if there\r\nis a more murderous villain than the mink, I have yet to find him\r\nout. The mink is a midnight assassin, who loves slaughter for the\r\njoy of murder. The wolverine, the marten, mink and weasel are all\r\ncourageous, savage and merciless. To the wolverine Western\r\ntrappers accord the evil distinction of being a veritable imp of\r\ndarkness on four legs. To them he is the arch-fiend, beyond which\r\nanimal cunning and depravity cannot go. Excepting the profane\r\nhistory of the pickings and stealings of this \"mountain devil\" as\r\nrecorded by suffering trappers, I know little of it; but if its\r\ninstincts are not supremely murderous, its reputation is no index\r\nof its character.\r\n\r\nThe mink, however, is a creature that we know and fear. Along the\r\nrocky shores of the Bronx River, even in the Zoological Park, it\r\nperversely persisted long after our park-building began. In spite\r\nof traps, guns, and poison, and the killing of from three to five\r\nannually in our Park, _Putorius vison_ would not give up.\r\nWith us, the only creatures that practiced wholesale and\r\nunnecessary murder were minks and dogs. The former killed our\r\nbirds, and during one awful period when a certain fence was being\r\nrebuilt, the latter destroyed several deer. A mink once visited an\r\nopen-air yard containing twenty-two pinioned laughing gulls, and\r\nduring that _noche triste_ killed all of those ill-fated\r\nbirds. It did not devour even one, and it sucked the blood of only\r\ntwo or three.\r\n\r\nOn another tragic occasion a mink slaughtered an entire flock of\r\nfifteen gulls; but its joy of killing was short-lived, for it was\r\nquickly caught and clubbed to death. A miserable little weasel\r\nkilled three fine brant geese, purely for the love of murder; and\r\nthen he departed this life by the powder-and-lead route.\r\n\r\nAll the year round captive buffalo bulls are given to fighting,\r\nand for one bull to injure or kill another is an occurrence all\r\ntoo common. Even in the great twenty-seven thousand acre reserve\r\nof the Corbin Blue Mountain Forest Association, fatal fights\r\nsometimes occur. It was left to a large bull named Black Beauty,\r\nin our Zoological Park herd, to reveal the disagreeable fact that\r\nunder certain circumstances a buffalo may become a cunning and\r\ndeliberate assassin.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1904, a new buffalo bull, named Apache, was added\r\nto the portion of our herd which up to that time had been\r\ndominated by Black Beauty. We expected the usual head-to-head\r\nbattle for supremacy, succeeded by a period of peace and quiet. It\r\nis the law of the herd that after every contest for supremacy the\r\nvanquished bull shall accept the situation philosophically, and\r\nthereafter keep his place.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a half-hour of fierce struggle, head-to-head, Black\r\nBeauty was overpowered by Apache, and fled from him into the open\r\nrange. To emphasize his victory, Apache followed him around and\r\naround at a quiet walk, for several hours; but the beaten bull\r\nalways kept a factor of safety of about two hundred feet between\r\nhimself and the master of the herd. Convinced that Black Beauty\r\nwould no longer dispute his supremacy, Apache at last pronounced\r\nfor peace and thought no more about the late unpleasantness. His\r\nrival seemed to accept the situation, and rejoined the herd on the\r\nsubdued status of an ex-president.\r\n\r\nFor several days nothing occurred; but all the while Black Beauty\r\nwas biding his time and watching for an opportunity. At last it\r\ncame. As Apache lay dozing and ruminating on a sunny hill-side,\r\nhis beaten rival quietly drifted around his resting-place,\r\nstealthily secured a good position, and, without a second's\r\nwarning plunged his sharp horns deep into the lungs of the\r\nreclining bull. With the mad energy of pent-up and superheated\r\nfury, the assassin delivered stab after stab into the unprotected\r\nside of the helpless victim, and before Apache could gain his feet\r\nhe had been gored many times. He lived only a few minutes.\r\n\r\nIt was foul murder, fully premeditated; and had Black Beauty been\r\nmy personal property, he would have been executed for the crime,\r\nwithout any objections, or motions, or appeals, or far-fetched\r\ncertificates of unreasonable doubt.\r\n\r\nDuring the past twenty years a number of persons have been\r\ntreacherously murdered by animals they had fed and protected. One\r\nof the most deplorable of these tragedies occurred late in 1906,\r\nnear Montclair, New Jersey. Mr. Herbert Bradley was the victim.\r\nWhile walking through his deer park, he was wantonly attacked by a\r\nwhite-tailed buck and murdered on the spot. At Helena, Montana, a\r\nstrong man armed with a pitchfork was killed by a bull elk. There\r\nhave been several other fatalities from elk.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of such crimes as the above have been committed\r\nby members of the Deer Family (deer, elk, moose and caribou). The\r\nhollow-horned ruminants seem to be different. I believe that\r\ntoward their keepers the bison, buffaloes and wild cattle\r\nentertain a certain measure of respect that in members of the Deer\r\nFamily often is totally absent. But there are exceptions; and a\r\nvery sad and notable case was the murder of Richard W. Rock, of\r\nHenry's Lake, Idaho, in 1903.\r\n\r\nDick Rock was a stalwart ranchman in the prime of life, who\r\npossessed a great fondness for big-game animals. He lived not far\r\nfrom the western boundry of the Yellowstone Park. He liked to rope\r\nelk and moose in winter, and haul them on sleds to his ranch; to\r\ncatch mountain goats or mule deer for exhibition; and to breed\r\nbuffaloes. His finest bull buffalo, named Indian, was one of his\r\nfavorites, and was broken _to ride!_ Scores of times Rock\r\nrode him around the corral, barebacked and without bridle or\r\nhalter. Rock felt that he could confidently trust the animal, and\r\nhe never dreamed of guarding himself against a possible evil day.\r\n\r\nBut one day the blood lust seized the buffalo, and he decided to\r\nassassinate his best friend. The next time Dick Rock entered the\r\ncorral, closing the gate and fastening it securely,--thus shutting\r\nhimself in,--the big bull attacked him so suddenly and fiercely\r\nthat there was not a moment for either escape or rescue. We can\r\neasily estimate the suddenness of the attack by the fact that\r\nalert and active Dick Rock had not time even to climb upon the\r\nfence of the corral, whereby his life would have been saved. With\r\na mighty upward thrust, the treacherous bull drove one of his\r\nhorns deeply into his master's body, and impaled him so completely\r\nand so securely that the man hung there and died there! As a\r\ncrowning horror, the bull was unable to dislodge his victim, and\r\nthe body of the ranchman was carried about the corral on the horns\r\nof his assassin until the horrified wife went a mile and a half\r\nand summoned a neighbor, who brought a rifle and executed the\r\nmurderer on the spot.\r\n\r\nSuch sudden onslaughts as this make it unsafe to trust implicitly,\r\nand without recourse, to the good temper of any animal having\r\ndangerous horns.\r\n\r\nIf bird-lovers knew the prevalence of the murder instinct among\r\nthe feathered folk, no doubt they would be greatly shocked. Many\r\nan innocent-looking bird is really a natural villain without\r\nopportunity to indulge in crime. It is in captivity that the\r\nwickedness inherent in wild creatures comes to the surface and\r\nbecomes visible. In the open, the weak ones manage to avoid\r\ndanger, and to escape when threatened; but, with twenty birds in\r\none large cage, escape is not always possible. A \"happy-family\" of\r\na dozen or twenty different species often harbors a criminal in\r\nits midst; and when the criminal cunningly waits until all\r\npossibilities of rescue are eliminated, an assassination is the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n[Illustration with caption: RICHARD W. ROCK AND HIS\r\nBUFFALO MURDERER This bison treacherously killed the man soon\r\nafter this picture was made]\r\n\r\n[Illustration with caption: \"BLACK BEAUTY\" MURDERING \"APACHE\"]\r\nHere is a partial list of the crimes in our bird collection during\r\none year:\r\n\r\nA green jay killed a blue jay. A jay-thrush and several smaller\r\nbirds were killed by laughing thrushes,--which simply love to do\r\nmurder! A nightingale was killed by a catbird and two mocking-\r\nbirds. Two snake-birds killed a third one--all of them thoroughly\r\ndepraved villains. Three gulls murdered another; a brown pelican\r\nwas killed by trumpeter-swans; and a Canada goose was killed by a\r\ngull. All these victims were birds in good health.\r\n\r\nIt is deplorable, but nevertheless true, that in large mixed\r\ncompanies of birds, say where forty or fifty live together, it is\r\na common thing for a sick bird to be set upon and killed, unless\r\nrescued by the keepers. In crimes of this class birds often murder\r\ntheir own kind, but they are quite as ready to kill members of\r\nother species. In 1902 a sick brant goose was killed by its mates;\r\nand so were a red-tailed hawk, two saras cranes, two black\r\nvultures, a road-runner, and a great horned owl. An aged and\r\nsickly wood ibis was killed by a whooping crane; and a night heron\r\nkilled its mate.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, among reptiles there is far less of real\r\nfirst-degree murder than among mammals and birds. Twenty\r\nrattlesnakes may be crowded together in one cage, without a family\r\njar. Even among cobras, perhaps the most irritable and pugnacious\r\nof all serpents, I think one snake never wantonly murders another,\r\nalthough about once in twenty years one will try to swallow\r\nanother. The big pythons and anacondas never fight, nor try to\r\ncommit murder. And yet, a twenty-foot regal python with a bad\r\nheart--like Nansen's polar bear--could easily constrict and kill\r\nany available snake of smaller size.\r\n\r\nAt this moment I do not recall one instance of wanton murder among\r\nserpents. It is well known that some snakes devour other snakes;\r\nbut that is not crime. The record of the crocodilians is not so\r\nclear. It is a common thing for the large alligators in our\r\nReptile House to battle for supremacy and in these contests\r\nseveral fatalities have occurred. Some of these occurrences are\r\nnot of the criminal sort; but when a twelve-foot alligator attacks\r\nand kills a six-foot individual, entirely out of his class and far\r\ntoo small to fight with him, it is murder. An alligator will seize\r\nthe leg of a rival and by violently whirling around on his axis,\r\nlike a revolving shaft, twist the leg completely off.\r\n\r\nAmong sea creatures, the clearly defined criminal instinct, as\r\nexhibited aside from the never-ending struggle for existence and\r\nthe quest of food, is rarely observed, possibly because\r\nopportunities are so few. The sanguinary exploits of the grampus,\r\nor whale-killer, among whales small enough to be killed and eaten,\r\nare the onslaughts of a marine glutton in quest of food.\r\n\r\nAmong the fishes there is one murderer whose evil reputation is\r\nwell deserved. The common swordfish of the Atlantic, forty miles\r\nor so off Block Island or Montauk Point, is not only one of the\r\nmost fearless of all fishes, but it also is the most dangerous.\r\nHis fierce attacks upon the boats of men who have harpooned him\r\nand seek to kill him are well known, and his unparalleled courage\r\nfairly challenges our wonder and admiration. But, unfortunately,\r\nthe record of the swordfish is stained with crime. When the spirit\r\nof murder prompts him to commit a crime in sheer wantonness, he\r\nwill attack a whale, stab the unfortunate monster again and again,\r\nand pursue it until it is dead. This is prompted solely by\r\nbrutality and murder lust, for the swordfish feeds upon fish, and\r\nnever attempts to eat any portion of a whale. It can easily be\r\nproved that wild animals in a normal state of nature are by no\r\nmeans as much given to murder, either of their own kind or other\r\nkinds, as are many races of men. The infrequency of animal\r\nmurders cannot be due wholly to the many possibilities for the\r\nintended victim to escape, nor to difficulty in killing. In every\r\nwild species murders are abundantly possible; but it is wholly\r\nagainst the laws of nature for free wild beasts to kill one\r\nanother in wantonness. It is left to the savage races of men to\r\ncommit murders without cause, and to destroy one another by fire.\r\nThe family crimes and cruelties of people both civilized and\r\nsavage completely eclipse in blackness and in number the doings of\r\neven the worst wild beasts. In wild animals and in men, crime is\r\nan index to character. The finest species of animals and the\r\nnoblest races of men are alike distinguished by their abhorrence\r\nof the abuse of the helpless and the shedding of innocent blood.\r\nThe lion, the elephant, the wild horse, the grizzly bear, the\r\norang-utan, the eagle and the whooping crane are singularly free\r\nfrom the criminal instinct. On the other hand, even today Africa\r\ncontains tribes whose members are actually fond of practicing\r\ncruelty and murder. In the Dark Continent there has lived many a\r\n\"king\" beside whom a hungry lion or a grizzly bear is a noble\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\nFIGHTING WITH WILD ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe study of the intelligence and temperaments of wild animals is\r\nby no means a pursuit of academic interest only. Men now are\r\nmixing up with dangerous wild beasts far more extensively than\r\never before, and many times a life or death issue hangs upon the\r\nman's understanding of the animal mind. I could cite a long and\r\ngruesome list of trainers, keepers and park owners who have been\r\nkilled by the animals they did not correctly understand.\r\n\r\nNot long ago, it was a park owner who was killed by a dangerous\r\ndeer. Next it was a bull elk who killed the keeper who undertook\r\nto show that the animal was afraid of him. In Idaho we saw a\r\ndeath-penalty mistake with a bull buffalo. Recently, in Spain, an\r\nAmerican ape trainer was killed by his big male chimpanzee.\r\nRecently in Switzerland a snake-charmer was strangled and killed\r\non the stage by her python.\r\n\r\nMen who keep or who handle dangerous animals owe it to themselves,\r\ntheir heirs and their assigns to _know the animal mind and\r\ntemperament, and to keep on the safe side._\r\n\r\nIn view of the tragedies and near-tragedies that animal trainers\r\nand keepers have been through during the past twenty years, I am\r\ndesirous of so vividly exhibiting the wild animal mind and temper\r\nthat at least a few of the mistakes of the past may be avoided in\r\nthe future. Fortunately I am able to state that thus far no one\r\never has been killed by an animal in the Zoological Park; but\r\nseveral of our men have been severely hurt. The writer hereof\r\ncarries two useless fingers on his best hand as a reminder of a\r\nfracas with a savage bear. How Dangerous Animals Attack Men. The\r\nfollowing may be listed as the wild animals most dangerous to man:\r\n\r\n1. In the open: Alaskan brown bears, the grizzly bears, lion,\r\ntiger, elephant, leopard, wolf, African buffalo, Indian gaur and\r\nbuffalo, and gorilla.\r\n\r\nAll these species are dangerous to the man who meddles with them,\r\neither to kill or to capture them. If they are not molested by\r\nman, there is very little to fear from any of them save the man-\r\neating lions, and tigers, the northern wolf packs, Alaskan brown\r\nbears and rogue elephants.\r\n\r\n2. In captivity, or in process of capture: Under this head a\r\nspecial list may be thus composed:\r\n\r\nMale elk and deer in the rutting season; male elephants over\r\nfifteen years of age; all bears over one year of age, and\r\nespecially \"pet\" bears; all gorillas, chimpanzees and orangs over\r\nseven years of age (puberty); all adult male baboons, gibbons,\r\nrhesus monkeys, callithrix or green monkeys, Japanese red-faced\r\nmonkeys and large macaques; many adult bison bulls and cows of\r\nindividually bad temper; also gaur, Old World buffalo, anoa bulls,\r\nmany individually bad African antelopes, gnus and hartebeests; all\r\nlions, tigers, jaguars, leopards, wolves, hyenas, and all male\r\nzebras and wild asses over four years of age.\r\n\r\nHow they attack. The _lion, tiger and bear_ launches at a\r\nman's head or face a lightning-quick and powerful fore-paw blow\r\nthat in one stroke tears the skin and flesh in long gashes, and\r\nknocks down the victim with stunning force. Before recovery is\r\npossible the assailant rushes to the prostrate man and begins to\r\nbite or to tear him. Instinctively the fallen man covers his face\r\nwith his arms, and with the lion, tiger and leopard the arms come\r\nin for fearful punishment. It is the way of carnivorous beasts to\r\nattack each other head to head and mouth to mouth, and this same\r\ninstinct leads these animals to focus their initial attacks upon\r\nthe heads and faces of their human quarry.\r\n\r\nAfter a man-eating lion or tiger has reduced the human victim to a\r\nstate of non-resistance, the great beast seizes the man by a bite\r\nembracing the chest, and with the feet dragging upon the ground\r\nrushes off to a place of safety to devour him at leisure. Dr.\r\nDavid Livingston was seized alive by a lion, and carried I forget\r\nhow many yards without a stop. His left humerus was broken in the\r\nonset, but the lion abandoned him without doing him any further\r\nserious harm.\r\n\r\nOnce I could not believe that a lion or a tiger could pick up a\r\nman in his mouth and rapidly carry him off, as a fox gets away\r\nwith a chicken; but when I shot a male tiger weighing 495 pounds,\r\nstanding 37 inches high and measuring 35 inches around his jaws, I\r\nwas forever convinced. In the Malay Peninsula Captain Syers told\r\nme that a tiger leaped a stockade seven feet high, seized a\r\nChinese woodcutter, leaped out with him, and carried him away.\r\n\r\nIn a scrimmage with a lion or tiger in the open, the fight is not\r\nprolonged. It is a case of kill or be killed quickly. The time of\r\ntimes for steady nerves and perfectly accurate shooting is when a\r\nlion, tiger or bear charges the hunter at full speed, beginning\r\nsufficiently far away to give the hunter a sporting chance. _The\r\nhunter can not afford to be \"scared!\"_ It is liable to cost too\r\nmuch!\r\n\r\nThe Alaskan brown bear has a peculiar habit. Occasionally he kills\r\nthe hunter he has struck down, but very often he contents himself\r\nwith biting his victim on his fleshy parts, _literally from head\r\nto foot._ More than one unfortunate amateur hunter has been\r\nfearfully bitten without having a bone broken, and without having\r\nan important artery or vein severed. Such unfortunates lie upon\r\ntheir faces, with their arms protecting their heads as best they\r\ncan, and take the awful punishment until the bear tires of it and\r\ngoes away. Then they _crawl,_ on hands and knees, to come\r\nwithin reach of discovery and help. In the annals of Alaska's\r\nfrontier life there are some heart-rending records of cases such\r\nas I have described, coupled with some marvellous recoveries.\r\nStrange to say, bear bites or scratches _almost never produce\r\nblood poisoning!_ This seems very strange, for the bites of\r\nlions, tigers and leopards very frequently end in blood poisoning,\r\nincurable fever and death. This probably is due to the clean mouth\r\nof the omnivorous bear and the infected mouth of the large cats,\r\nfrom putrid meat between their teeth.\r\n\r\n_The wolf_ is particularly dangerous to his antagonists, man\r\nor beast, from the cutting power of his fearful snap. His molar\r\nteeth shear through flesh and small bones like the gash of a\r\nbutcher's cleaver; and his wide gape and lightning-quick\r\nmovements render him a very dangerous antagonist. The bite of a\r\nwolf is the most dangerous to man of any animal bite to which\r\nkeepers are liable, and it is the law of zoological gardens and\r\nparks that every wolf bite means a quick application of anti-\r\nrabies treatment at a Pasteur institute. Personally, I would be no\r\nmore scared by a wolf-bite than by a feline bite, but the verdict\r\nof the jury is,--\"it is best to be on the safe side.\"\r\n\r\n_Buck elk and deer_ very, very rarely attack men in the\r\nwilds, unless they have been wounded and brought to bay; and then\r\nvery naturally they fight furiously. It is the attacks of captive\r\nor park-bred animals that are most to be feared.\r\n\r\nAll the deer that I know attack in the same way,--first by a\r\n_slow_ push forward, in order to come to close quarters\r\n_without getting hurt,_ and then follows the relentless push,\r\npush, push to get up steam for the final raging and death-dealing\r\ndrive. Even in fighting each other, buck elk and deer do not come\r\ntogether with a long run and a grand crash. Each potential fighter\r\n_fears for his own eyes,_ and conserves them by a cautious\r\nand deliberate engaging process. This is referred to in another\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nFortunately for poor humanity, the same slow and cautious tactics\r\nare adopted when a buck deer or wapiti decides to attack a man.\r\nThis gives the man in the case a chance to put up his defense.\r\n\r\nThe attacking deer lowers his head, throws his antlers far to the\r\nfront, and pushes for the body of the man. The instant a tine\r\ntouches the soft breast or abdomen, he lunges forward to drive it\r\nin. But thanks to that life-saving slow start, the man is\r\nmercifully afforded a few seconds of time in which to save\r\nhimself, or at least delay the punishment.\r\n\r\nNo man ever should enter the enclosure of a \"bad\" deer, or any\r\nbuck deer in the rut, without a stout and tough club or pitchfork\r\nfor defense. Of the two weapons, the former is the best.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, keep away from all bad deer, especially\r\nbetween October and January first. If you are beset, follow these\r\ninstructions, as you value your life:\r\n\r\nIf unarmed, seize the deer by the antlers before he touches your\r\nvitals, hold on for all you are worth, and _shout for help. Keep\r\nyour feet,_ just as long as you possibly can. Never mind being\r\nthreshed about, so long as you keep your feet and keep the tines\r\nout of your vitals. Your three hopes are (1) that help will come,\r\n(2) or that you can come within reach of a club or some shelter,\r\nor (3) that the animal will in some manner decide to desist,--a\r\nmost forlorn hope.\r\n\r\nWith a good club, or even a stout walking-stick, you have a\r\nfighting chance. As the animal lowers his head and comes close up\r\nto impale you on his spears of bone, hit him a smashing blow\r\n_across the side of his head, or his nose._ In a desperate\r\nsituation, _aim at the eye,_ and lay on the blows. If your\r\nlife is in danger from a buck elk or a large deer, do not hesitate\r\nabout putting out an eye for him. What are a thousand deer eyes\r\ncompared with a twelve inch horn thrust through your stomach? My\r\nstanding instructions to our keepers of dangerous animals are:\r\n\"Save your own life, at all hazards. Don't let a dangerous animal\r\nkill you. Kill any animal rather than let it kill you!\"\r\n\r\nIt is useless to strike a charging deer on the top of its head, or\r\non its antlers. Give a sweeping _side_ blow for the\r\nunprotected cheek and jaw, or the tender nose. There is nothing\r\nthat a club can do that is so disconcerting as the eye and nose\r\nattack, for a badly injured eye always shuts both eyes,\r\nautomatically. Once when alone in the corral of the axis deer\r\nherd, I was treacherously and wantonly attacked by a full-grown\r\nbuck. I had violated my own rules about going in armed with a\r\nstick, and it was lucky for me that the axis deer was not as large\r\nas the barasingha or the mule deer. As the buck lowered his head,\r\nthrew his long, sharp beams straight forward, and pushed for my\r\nvitals, I seized him by both antlers, to make my defense. At that\r\nhe drove forward and nearly upset me. Quickly I let go the right\r\nantler and shifted myself to the animal's left side, where by\r\nmeans of the left antler I pulled the struggling buck's head\r\naround to my side. Then he began to plunge. Throwing the weight of\r\nmy chest upon his shoulders I reached over him and with my free\r\nhand finally grasped his right foreleg below the knee, and pulled\r\nit up clear of the ground. With that I had him.\r\n\r\nHe tried to struggle free, but I was strong in those days, and\r\nangry besides, and he was helpless. Up beside the deer barn, most\r\nprovidentially for the finish, I saw a very beautiful barrel\r\nstave. It was the very thing! I worked him over to it, caught it\r\nup, and then still holding him by his left antler I laid that\r\nstave along his side until he was well punished, and glad when\r\nreleased to rush from that neighborhood.\r\n\r\nFemale \"pet\" deer, and female elk, can and do put up dangerous\r\nfights with their front hoofs, standing high up on their hind legs\r\nand striking fast and furiously. A gentleman of my acquaintance\r\nwas thus attacked, most unexpectedly, by his pet white-tailed deer\r\ndoe. She struck about a dozen times for his breast, and his vest\r\nand coat were slit open in several places. I once saw two cow elk\r\nengage with their front feet in a hot fight, but they did no real\r\ndamage.\r\n\r\nOf course an angry _bison, buffalo or gaur_ lowers its head\r\nin attacking a man, and seeks to gore and toss him at the same\r\nmoment. The American bison will start at a distance of ten or\r\ntwenty yards, and with half lowered head jump forward, grunting\r\n\"Uh! Uh! Uh!\" as he comes. When close up he pauses for a second\r\nand poises his head for the toss. That is the man's one chance. At\r\nthat instant he must strike the animal on the side of his head,\r\nand strike hard; and the region of the eye is the spot at which to\r\naim.\r\n\r\nOnce we were greatly frightened by the determined charge of a\r\nsavage cow bison upon Keeper McEnroe, who was armed with a short-\r\nhandled 4-tine pitchfork. As she grunted and came for him we could\r\nnot refrain from shouting a terrorized warning, \"Look out,\r\nMcEnroe! Look out!\"\r\n\r\nHe looked out. He stood perfectly still, and calmly awaited the\r\nonset. The cow rushed close up, and dropped her chin low down for\r\nthe goring toss. The keeper was ready for her. Swinging his\r\npitchfork he delivered a smashing blow upon the left side of the\r\ncow's head, which disconcerted and checked her. Before she could\r\nrecover herself he smashed her again, and again. Then she turned\r\ntail and ran, followed by the shouts of the multitude.\r\n\r\n_Adult male elephants_ are among the most dangerous of all\r\nwild animals to keep in captivity. They _will_ grow bad-\r\ntempered with adult age, keepers _will_ become careless of\r\ndanger that is present every day, and a bad elephant often is a\r\ncunning and deceitful devil. The strength of an elephant is so\r\ngreat, the toughness of its hide is so pronounced, and the danger\r\nof a sudden attack is so permanent that life in a park with a\r\n\"bad\" elephant is one continuous nightmare.\r\n\r\nNaturally we have been ambitious to prevent all manner of fatal\r\nwild beast attacks upon our keepers. We try our best to provide\r\nfor their safety, and having done that to the limit we say: \"Now\r\nit is up to you to preserve your own life. If you can not save\r\nyourself from your bad animals, no other person can do it for\r\nyou!\"\r\n\r\nEither positively, comparatively or superlatively, a bad elephant\r\nis a cunning, treacherous and dangerous animal. We have seen\r\nseveral elephants in various stages of cussedness. Alice, the\r\nadult Indian female, is mentally a freak, but she is not vicious\r\nsave under one peculiar combination of circumstances. Take her\r\noutside her yard, and instantly she becomes a storm centre. Gunda\r\nwas bad to begin with, worse in continuation and murderously\r\nworst at his finish. At present Kartoum is dangerous only to\r\ninanimate fences and doors.\r\n\r\nA wild elephant attacks a hunter by charging furiously and\r\npersistently, sometimes making a real man-chase, seizing the man\r\nor knocking him down, and then impaling him upon his tusks as he\r\nlies. More than one hunter has been knocked down, and escaped the\r\nimpalement thrust only through the mercy of heaven that caused the\r\ntusks to miss him and expend their murderous fury in the ample\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nOn rare occasions an enraged wild elephant deliberately tramples a\r\nman to death; and there is one instance on record wherein the\r\nelephant held his dead native victim firmly to the ground while he\r\ntore him asunder \"and actually jerked his arms and legs to some\r\ndistance.\"\r\n\r\nIn captivity a mean elephant kills a keeper, or other person, by\r\nsuddenly knocking him down, and then either trampling upon him or\r\nimpaling him.\r\n\r\nGunda, our big male Indian tusker, was the worst elephant with\r\nwhich I ever came in close touch, and we hope never to see his\r\nlike again. When about ten years old he came to us direct from\r\nAssam, and when I saw his big and bulging eyes, and the slits torn\r\nin his ears, I recognized him as a bad-tempered animal. I kept my\r\nopinions to myself. Two weeks later when we started Gunda's Hindu\r\nkeeper back toward his native land, I sent for Keepers Gleason and\r\nForester to give them a choice lot of instruction in elephant\r\nmanagement. They heard me through attentively, and then Forester\r\nsaid very solemnly:\r\n\r\n\"Director, I think that is a bad elephant; and I'm afraid of him!\"\r\n\r\nKeeper Gleason willingly took him over, on condition that he\r\nshould have sole charge of him, and as long as Gleason remained in\r\nour service he managed the elephant successfully. Elsewhere I\r\nhave spoken at length of Gunda's mind and manners. He went\r\nsteadily from bad to worse; but we never once really punished him.\r\nThe time was when there was only one man in the world whom he\r\nfeared, and would obey, and that was his keeper, Walter Thuman. I\r\nhave seen that great dangerous beast cower and quake with fear,\r\nand back off into a corner, when Thuman's powerful voice yelled at\r\nhim, and admonished him to behave himself. But all that ended on\r\nthe day that he \"got\" Thuman.\r\n\r\nOn that fateful afternoon, with no visitors present, Thuman opened\r\nthe outside door, took Gunda by the left ear, and with his steel-\r\nshod elephant hook in his left hand started to lead the huge\r\nanimal out into his yard. Just inside the doorway Gunda thought he\r\nsaw his chance, and he took it.\r\n\r\nWith a fierce sidewise thrust of his head he struck his keeper\r\nsquarely on the shoulder and sent him plunging to the floor in the\r\nstall corner nearest him. Then, instantly he wheeled about and\r\nstarted to follow up his attack. In the fall Thuman's hook flew\r\nfrom his hand.\r\n\r\nAt first Gunda tried to step on him, but he lay so close into the\r\ncorner that the elephant could not plant his feet so that they\r\nwould do execution. Then he tried to kneel upon the keeper, with\r\nthe same result.\r\n\r\nThuman struggled more closely into the corner, and tried hard to\r\npull himself into the refuse box, through its low door; but with\r\nhis trunk Gunda caught him by a leg and dragged him back. Then he\r\nmade a fierce downward thrust with his tusks, which were nearly\r\nfour feet long, to transfix his intended victim.\r\n\r\nHis left tusk struck the steel-clad wall and shattered into\r\nfragments, half way up. The resounding crash of that breaking tusk\r\nwas what saved Thuman's life.\r\n\r\nGunda thrust again and again with his sound tusk, with the\r\nterrified and despairing keeper trying to cling to the broken tusk\r\nand save himself. At last the point of the sound tusk drove full\r\nand fair through the flat of Thuman's left thigh, as he lay, and\r\nstopped against the concrete floor.\r\n\r\nExperienced animal men always are listening for sounds of trouble.\r\n\r\nIn the cage of Alice, three cages and a vestibule distant, Keeper\r\nDick Richards was busily working, when he heard the peculiar crash\r\nof that shattered tusk. \"What's all that!\" said he; and \"That's\r\nsome trouble,\" was his own answer.\r\n\r\nGrabbing his pitchfork he shot out of that cage, ran down the\r\nkeeper's passage and in about ten seconds' arrived in front of\r\nGunda's cage. And there was Gunda, killing Walter Thuman.\r\n\r\nRichards darted in between the widely-separated front bars, gave a\r\nwild yell, and with a fierce thrust drove all the tines of his\r\npitchfork into Gunda's unprotected hind-quarters, where the skin\r\nwas thin and vulnerable.\r\n\r\nWith a shrill trumpet scream of pain and rage, Gunda whirled away\r\nfrom Thuman, bolted through the door, and rushed madly into his\r\nyard.\r\n\r\nKeeper Thuman survived, and his recovery was presently\r\naccomplished. When I first called to see him he begged me not to\r\nkill Gunda for what he had done, or tried to do. In due course\r\nThuman got well, and again took charge of Gunda; but after that\r\nthe elephant was not afraid of him. We adopted a policy which\r\nprevented further accidents, but finally Gunda became a hopeless\r\ncase of sexual insanity and lust for murder.\r\n\r\nWhen Gunda became most dangerous, we protected our keepers by\r\nchaining his feet, and keeping the men out of the reach of his\r\ntrunk. Because of this, his fury was boundless; and as soon as it\r\nwas apparent that he was suffering from his confinement and never\r\nwould be any better, we quickly decided to end it all. He was\r\npainlessly put to death, by Mr. Carl E. Akeley, with a single .26\r\ncalibre bullet very skilfully sent through the elephant's brain.\r\n\r\n_Chimpanzees and Orang-Utans_ attack and fight men just as\r\nthey attack each other,--by biting the face and neck, and the\r\nhands, shoulders and arms. The fighting ape always reaches out,\r\nseizes the arm or wrist of the person to be harmed, drags it up to\r\nhis mouth and bites savagely. As a home illustration of this\r\nmethod of attack, a chimpanzee named Chico in the Central Park\r\nMenagerie once bit a finger from the hand of his keeper. In April,\r\n1921, Mr. Ellis Joseph, the animal dealer, was very severely\r\nbitten on his face and neck by his own chimpanzee, so much so in\r\nfact that eighteen stitches were required to sew up his\r\nlacerations.\r\n\r\nOne excellent thing about the manners of chimpanzees and orang-\r\nutans in captivity and on the stage is that they do not turn\r\ndeadly dangerous all in a moment, as do bears and elephants, and\r\noccasionally deer. The ape who is falling from grace goes\r\ngradually, and gives warning signs that wise men recognize. They\r\nfirst become strong and boisterous, then they playfully resist and\r\ndefy the keeper's restraining hand. Next in order they openly\r\nbecome angry at their keepers over trifles, and bristle up, stamp\r\non the floor and savagely yell. It is then that the whip and the\r\nstick become not only useless but dangerous to the user, and must\r\nbe discarded. It is then that new defensive tactics must be\r\ninaugurated, and the keeper must see to it that the big and\r\ndangerous ape gets no advantage. This means the exercise of good\r\nstrategy, and very careful management in cage-cleaning. It calls\r\nfor two cages for each dangerous ape.\r\n\r\nThere is only one thing in this world of which our three big\r\nchimps are thoroughly afraid, and that is an absurd little _toy\r\ngun_ that cost about fifty cents, and looks it. No matter how\r\nbad Boma may be acting, if Keeper Palmer says in a sharp tone,\r\n\"_Where's that gun!_\" Boma hearkens and stops short, and if\r\nthe \"gun\" is shown in front of his cage he flies in terror to the\r\ntop of his second balcony, and cowers in a corner.\r\n\r\nWhy are those powerful and dangerous apes afraid of that absurd\r\ntoy? I do not know. Perhaps the answer is--instinct; but if so,\r\nhow was it acquired? The natives of the chimp country do not have\r\nmany firearms, and the white man's guns have been seen and heard\r\nby not more than one out of every thousand of that chimp\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nBaboons Throw Stones. So far as we are aware, baboons are the only\r\nmembers of the Order Primates who ever deliberately throw\r\nmissiles as means of offense. In 1922 there was in the New York\r\nZoological Park a savage and aggressive Rhodesian baboon\r\n(_Choiropithecus rhodesiae,_ Haagner) which throws stones at\r\npeople whenever he can get hold of such missiles. We have seen him\r\nset up against Keeper Palmer and Curator Ditmars a really vigorous\r\nbombardment with stones and coal that had been supplied him. His\r\nthrow was by means of a vigorous underhand pitch, and but for the\r\nintervening bars he would have done very good execution.\r\n\r\nKeeper Rawlinson, of the Primate House, who was in the Boer War,\r\nstates that on one occasion when his company was deploying along\r\nthe steep side of a rock-covered kopje a troop of baboons above\r\nthem rolled and threw so many stones down at the men that finally\r\ntwo machine guns were let loose on the savage beasts to disperse\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CURTAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nOn one side of the heights above the River of Life stand the men\r\nof this little world,--the fully developed, the underdone, and\r\nthe unbaked, in one struggling, seething mass. On the other side,\r\nand on a level but one step lower down, stands the vanguard of the\r\nlong procession of \"Lower\" Animals, led by the chimpanzee, the\r\norang and the gorilla. The natural bridge that _almost_ spans\r\nthe chasm lacks only the keystone of the arch.\r\n\r\nGive the apes just one thing,--_speech,_--and the bridge is\r\nclosed!\r\n\r\nTake away from a child its sight, speech and hearing, and the\r\nwhole world is a mystery, which only the hardest toil of science\r\nand education ever can reveal. Give back hearing and sight,\r\nwithout speech, and even then the world is only half available.\r\nGive a chimpanzee articulate expression and language, and no one\r\ncould fix a limit to his progress.\r\n\r\nTake away from a man the use of one lobe of his brain, and he is\r\nrendered speechless.\r\n\r\nThe great Apes have travelled up the River of Life on the opposite\r\nside from Man, but they are only one lap behind him. Let us not\r\ndeceive ourselves about that. Remember that truth is inexorable in\r\nits demands to be heard.\r\n\r\nWe need not rack our poor, finite minds over the final problem of\r\nevolution, or the final destiny of Man and Ape. We cannot prove\r\nanything beyond what we see. We do not know, and we never can\r\nknow, whether the chimpanzee has a \"soul\" or not; and we cannot\r\n_prove_ that the soul of man is immortal. If man possesses a\r\nsoul of lofty stature, why not a soul of lowly stature for the\r\nchimpanzee?\r\n\r\nWe do not know just _where_ \"heaven\" is; and we cannot know\r\nuntil we find it. But what does it all matter on earth, if we keep\r\nto the straight path, and rest our faith upon the Great Unseen\r\nPower that we call God?\r\n\r\nSaid the great Poet of Nature in his ode \"To a Waterfowl:\"\r\n\r\n   \"He who from zone to zone\r\nGuides through the boundless\r\nSky thy certain flight, In the long way that I must tread\r\n    alone Will lead my steps aright.\"\r\n\r\nCURTAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM T.
