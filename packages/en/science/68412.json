F.R.S. from_ Benjamin Franklin, _Esq;\r\nF.R.S._\r\n\r\n[Read Jan. 12, 1758.]\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nTHE following is what I can at present recollect, relating to the\r\neffects of electricity in paralytic cases, which have fallen under my\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nSome years since, when the news-papers made mention of great cures\r\nperformed in Italy or Germany, by means of electricity, a number of\r\nparalytics were brought to me from different parts of Pensylvania, and\r\nthe neighbouring provinces, to be electrised; which I did for them at\r\ntheir request. My method was, to place the patient first in a chair, on\r\nan electric stool, and draw a number of large strong sparks from all\r\nparts of the affected limb or side. Then I fully charged two six-gallon\r\nglass jars, each of which had about three square feet of surface\r\ncoated; and I sent the united shock of these thro’ the affected limb or\r\nlimbs; repeating the stroke commonly three times each day. The first\r\nthing observed was an immediate greater sensible warmth in the lame\r\nlimbs, that had received the stroke, than in the others: and the next\r\nmorning the patients usually related, that they had in the night felt\r\na pricking sensation in the flesh of the paralytic limbs; and would\r\nsometimes shew a number of small red spots, which they supposed were\r\noccasioned by those prickings. The limbs too were found more capable of\r\nvoluntary motion, and seemed to receive strength. A man, for instance,\r\nwho could not the first day lift the lame hand from off his knee, would\r\nthe next day raise it four or five inches, the third day higher; and\r\non the fifth day was able, but with a feeble languid motion, to take\r\noff his hat. These appearances gave great spirits to the patients, and\r\nmade them hope a perfect cure; but I do not remember, that I ever saw\r\nany amendment after the fifth day: which the patients perceiving, and\r\nfinding the shocks pretty severe, they became discouraged, went home,\r\nand in a short time relapsed; so that I never knew any advantage from\r\nelectricity in palsies, that was permanent. And how far the apparent\r\ntemporary advantage might arise from the exercise in the patients\r\njourney, and coming daily to my house, or from the spirits given by the\r\nhope of success, enabling them to exert more strength in moving their\r\nlimbs, I will not pretend to say.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some permanent advantage might have been obtained, if the\r\nelectric shocks had been accompanied with proper medicine and regimen,\r\nunder the direction of a skilful physician. It may be, too, that a few\r\ngreat strokes, as given in my method, may not be so proper as many\r\nsmall ones; since, by the account from Scotland of a case, in which two\r\nhundred shocks from a phial were given daily, it seems, that a perfect\r\ncure has been made. As to any uncommon strength supposed to be in the\r\nmachine used in that case, I imagine it could have no share in the\r\neffect produced; since the strength of the shock from charged glass is\r\nin proportion to the quantity of surface of the glass coated; so that\r\nmy shocks from those large jars must have been much greater than any,\r\nthat could be received from a phial held in the hand.\r\n\r\nI am, with great respect,\r\n\r\n                                 SIR,\r\n                      Your most obedient Servant,\r\n                             R. Franklin.\r\n\r\nLondon, Dec. 21, 1757.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLX. _Observations on the late Comet in_ September _and_ October 1757;\r\n_made at the_ Hague _by Mr._ D. Klinkenberg: _In a Letter to the Rev._\r\nJames Bradley, _D. D. Astronomer Royal, and F.R.S. and Member of the\r\nRoyal Academy of Sciences at_ Paris. _Translated from the_ Low Dutch.\r\n\r\n[Read Jan. 12, 1758.]\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI Hope you will be pleased to excuse the liberty, which I take, of\r\ntroubling you with my observations on the comet, which made its\r\nappearance here, and in other parts of Europe, in the months of\r\nSeptember and October last; and which, according to the news-papers,\r\nwas first observed the 11th September by Mr. Gartner, at Dorlkeurtz\r\nnear Dresden; then, by me, on the 16th of the said Month, here in the\r\nHague; and afterwards in different places. As I find, that you have\r\nobserved the comet, I doubt not but that you have done it in the most\r\naccurate manner; and my great love for this science induces me to beg,\r\nthat I may have the happiness of knowing some of your observations.\r\nMy good friend Mr. Struyk at Amsterdam wrote me some time ago, that\r\nhe intended to ask the same favour of you; but I have not since heard\r\nany further from him. I observed this comet from Septemb. 16th in\r\nthe morning, until Octob. the 11th in the morning; and found its\r\nsituations, according to my method, as follows:\r\n\r\n                                           _Longit._   _Latit._\r\n     1757.                                    °  ´       °  ´\r\n  Sept. 16. at 4 h. ante mer.

I have, since the month of February last to the end of\r\nMay, made sundry observations on fixed stars, with a telescope of 16\r\ninches, made by Mr. Short; and with a pendulum clock, made after the\r\nmanner of Mr. Graham, by Mr. Vryhthoff of this place. In the months\r\nof February and March, by a medium of eight observations, I found,\r\nthat by the clock, the star Rigel, in every daily revolution, passed\r\n4 min. 2⁴⁄₉ seconds of time earlier, in the telescope; and in the\r\nlatter end of May I found, by six observations, (the clock not in the\r\nleast changed or altered) on the star Spica Virginis, that that star,\r\nin every revolution, passed 4 min. 5¹⁄₂₀ sec. earlier, in the same\r\ntelescope; which intervals differ pretty nearly 2⅗ seconds of time from\r\none another. Whether this difference arises from any defect in the\r\nclock, or whether it proceeds from any small difference of velocity\r\nof the earth’s motion round its axis, I would have been very glad to\r\nhave endeavoured to find out by farther inquiry, had not the death of\r\nMr. S. Koenig intervened, and I thereby hindered from continuing my\r\nobservations. The above observations were taken in the observatory of\r\nhis illustrious Highness the minor Prince of Orange and Nassau, _&c.\r\n&c._ under the direction, and with the approbation of the aforesaid\r\nMr. Koenig. After the death of that gentleman, I petitioned her Royal\r\nHighness the Princess Governess of these Provinces, _&c._ that I might\r\nhave leave to continue my astronomical observations; but as yet I have\r\nnot been able to obtain her Royal Highness’s permission: otherwise I\r\nwould have observed this last comet with more exactness. Had I been\r\nable to pursue the above-mentioned observations, I would, for the\r\ngreater certainty in regard to the pendulum, have made use of a farther\r\nprecaution. By means of a stove, with the help of a thermometer, I\r\nwould have endeavoured to have kept the room (in which the clock stood)\r\nin the winter, and at all times, in the same degree of heat it had at\r\nthe time I made the observations in the summer. I would also have daily\r\nobserved and noted the moon’s place, at the time of the observations.\r\nTho’ this is but a slight observation of mine; yet I make no doubt, but\r\nthat in case, by the different distances of the earth from the sun,\r\nand the different distances and situations of the moon with respect\r\nto the earth, and the respective effects produced by these causes,\r\nany inequality arises in the velocity of the diurnal motion of the\r\nearth on its axis, you (who have made the most sublime observations on\r\nthe aberration of the fixed stars, and more than any mortal ever did\r\nbefore) must have discovered, and are well acquainted, with the same.\r\n\r\nAs my above-mentioned observations on the comet appeared too incorrect\r\nto undertake a calculation for the ascertaining of its path from the\r\ntheory, I contented myself with effecting it by a construction. By this\r\nmeans I found, on a figure, whose globular or spherical diameter was\r\n13½ Rhineland inches, as follows:\r\n\r\nThat the comet was in its perihelion the 21st of October, at two of the\r\nclock in the afternoon: the place of the perihelion 3 degrees in Leo.\r\nThe comet’s distance in the perihelion from the sun was about 34 parts,\r\nwhereof 100 make the mean distance between the sun and the earth. The\r\ninclination of the comet’s orbit with the ecliptic 13 degrees; and the\r\nsouthern latitude of the perihelion also 13 decrees: the ascending or\r\nnorth node ☊ 4⅓ degrees in Scorpio; and the comet’s motion direct, or\r\naccording to the order of the signs of the zodiac. On this supposition\r\nI have, for some of the times of observations, estimated the apparent\r\nplaces of the comet, and found them as follows:\r\n\r\n                                   _Long._  _Latit._\r\n  Sept. 18, at 3¾ ante merid. In ♋ 18¹⁄₁₂ and 9 deg. North.\r\n        19  -- 4   --  --     -- ♋ 22  ---- 8⅖\r\n        22  -- 2¾  --  --     -- ♌  3⅝ ---- 6¼\r\n        23  -- 4   --  --     -- ♌  7⅗ ---- 5½\r\n        25  -- 4¼  --  --     -- ♌ 14⅔ ---- 4\r\n        28  -- 4   --  --     -- ♌ 24⅓ ---- 1¾\r\n  Oct.   4  -- 4½  --  --     -- ♍  9⅓ ---- 2 ---- South.\r\n         9  -- 4¾  --  --     -- ♍ 19⅔ ---- 3⅖\r\n        11  -- 5   --  --     -- ♍ 23⅛ ---- 3⅘\r\n\r\nThe observations, which I have taken, to ground the measurement on, are\r\nthose of the 16th and 23d of September, and of the 1st of October. It\r\nappears very evident, not only from this rough calculation, but every\r\nother circumstance of this comet, that it is not the same with that\r\nin the year 1682: which, on certain accounts, is very desirable to be\r\nknown; for both here, and in other parts of the Netherlands, there\r\nhave been some people, who have published mere conjectures; and have\r\nventured (very minutely and exactly, as they pretended) about the time\r\nthat this comet first made its appearance, to predict the return of\r\nthe comet of the year 1682. But by the above, the weakness of their\r\npretensions is very evident to all the world: whereas, if this had\r\nproved to be the expected comet, they would have assumed to themselves\r\nmuch undue praise, and have pretended to knowlege even superior to the\r\nevery-where much celebrated Newton and Halley.\r\n\r\nIt appears also probable to me, that this comet is none of those\r\nalready calculated, or brought upon a list, by Messieurs Halley and\r\nStruyk. It is somewhat remarkable, that the line of the nodes is\r\nalmost at right angles with the long axis of the ellipsis; which\r\ncorresponds nearly with the comets of the years 1580, 1683, and 1686:\r\nbut those had their perihelions northward of the ecliptic; whereas the\r\nperihelion of the last, which we have lately seen, was to the southward\r\nof the ecliptic.\r\n\r\nI have the honour to subscribe myself, with the most perfect esteem for\r\nyou, and your sublime studies, very respectfully,\r\n\r\n                                 SIR,\r\n                Your very humble and obedient Servant,\r\n                            D. Klinkenberg.\r\n\r\nHague, 13th Dec. 1757.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXI. _Remarks on the different Temperature of the Air at_ Edystone,\r\n_from that observed at_ Plymouth, _between the 7th and 14th of_ July\r\n1757. _By Mr._ John Smeaton, _F.R.S._\r\n\r\n[Read Jan. 12, 1758.]\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nON the reading of Dr. Huxham’s letter at the last meeting, some\r\nobservations occurred to me, concerning the different temperature of\r\nthe air, which I had observed at the Edystone, from what had been\r\nobserved by the Doctor at Plymouth, between the 7th and 14th of July\r\nlast: which having been desired by some members to be put into writing,\r\nI beg leave to trouble you with the following.\r\n\r\nEdystone is distant from Plymouth about 16 miles, and without the\r\nhead-lands of the Sound about 11.\r\n\r\nThe 7th and 8th were not remarkable at Edystone for heat or cold; the\r\nweather was very moderate, with a light breeze at east; which allowed\r\nus to work upon the rock both days, when the tide served.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight, between the 8th and 9th, the wind being then fresh at\r\neast, it was remarkably cold for the season, as I had more particular\r\noccasion to observe, on account of a ship that was cast away upon the\r\nrocks. The wind continued cold the 9th all day; which was complained\r\nof by some of the shipwrecked seamen, who had not time to save their\r\ncloaths; and so fresh at east, as prevented our going near the rocks,\r\nor the wreck; and so continued till Sunday the 10th; when, seeing no\r\nprospect of a sudden alteration of weather, I returned to Plymouth in\r\na sailing boat, wrapped up in my thick coat. As soon as we got within\r\nthe headlands, I could perceive the wind to blow considerably warmer;\r\nbut not so warm as to make my great coat uneasy. Having had a quick\r\npassage, in this manner I went home, to the great astonishment of the\r\nfamily to see me so wrapped up, when they were complaining of the\r\nexcessive heat: and indeed, it was not long before I had reason to join\r\nin their opinion.\r\n\r\nThis heat I experienced till Tuesday the 12th, when I again went off to\r\nsea, where I found the air very temperate, rather cool than warm; and\r\nso continued till Thursday the 14th.\r\n\r\nIn my journal for Wednesday the 13th I find the following remarks,\r\n_viz._ “This evening’s tide” (from 6 A. till 12 A.) “the wind at east,\r\nbut moderate, with frequent flashes of lightning to the southward. Soon\r\nafter we got on board the store-vessel, a squall of wind arose from the\r\nsouth-west on a sudden, and continued for about a minute; part of which\r\ntime it blew so hard, we expected the masts to go by the board: after\r\nwhich it was perfectly calm, and presently after a breeze returned from\r\nthe east.”\r\n\r\nAnd in the journal of the 14th is entered, “This morning’s tide”\r\n(_viz._ from 1 M. to 1 A.) “the air and sea quite calm.”\r\n\r\nHence it appears, how different the temper of the air may be in a\r\nsmall distance; and to what small spaces squalls of wind are sometimes\r\nconfined.\r\n\r\nIt may not be amiss further to observe upon this head, that once, in\r\nreturning from Edystone, having got within about two miles of the\r\nRamhead, we were becalmed; and here we rolled about for at least four\r\nhours; and yet at the same time saw vessels, not above a league from\r\nus, going out of Plymouth Sound with a fresh of wind, whose direction\r\nwas towards us, as we could observe from the trim of their sails; and\r\nas we ourselves experienced, after we got into it by tacking and rowing.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir,\r\n\r\n                       Your most humble Servant,\r\n                              J. Smeaton.\r\n\r\nFurnival’s-Inn Court, 12th Jan. 1758.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXII. _An Account of the Earthquake felt in the Island of_ Sumatra, _in\r\nthe_ East-Indies, _in_ November _and_ December 1756. _In a Letter from\r\nMr._ Perry _to the Rev. Dr._ Stukeley, _dated at_ Fort Marlborough, _in\r\nthe Island of_ Sumatra, Feb. 20. 1757. _Communicated by the Rev._ Wm.\r\nStukeley, _M. D. F.R.S._\r\n\r\n[Read Jan. 12, 1758.]\r\n\r\nTHE earthquake at Lisbon, which you gave me an account of, was\r\ncertainly the most awful tremendous calamity, that has ever happened\r\nin the world. Its effects are extremely wonderful and amazing; and it\r\nseems, as you observe, to have been felt in all parts of the globe.\r\nOn the 3d day of the same month the earthquake of Lisbon happened, I\r\nfelt at Manna[1] a violent shock myself; and from that time to the 3d\r\nof December following I felt no less than twelve different shocks, all\r\nwhich I took an exact account of in my pocket-bock. Since which we have\r\nhad two very severe earthquakes, felt, we believe, throughout this\r\nisland[2]. The walls of[3] Cumberland-house[4] were greatly damaged\r\nby them. Salop-house[4], my own (formerly Mr. Massey’s), the houses\r\nof Laye[5] and Manna, were all cracked by them; and the works at the\r\nsugar-plantation[6] received considerable damage. The ground opened\r\nnear the _qualloe_[7] at Bencoolen, and up the River in several places;\r\nand there issued therefrom sulphureous earth, and large quantities of\r\nwater, sending forth a most intolerable stench. Poblo Point[8] was much\r\ncracked at the same time; and some _doosoons_[9] in-land at Manna were\r\ndestroyed, and many people in them.\r\n\r\nThese are all the ill effects, that have come to our knowlege; but, it\r\nis reasonable to suppose, not all the damage, that has happened upon\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIII. _Concerning the Fall of Water under Bridges. By Mr._ J.\r\nRobertson, _F.R.S._\r\n\r\n[Read Jan. 19, 1758.]\r\n\r\nSOME time before the year 1740, the problem about the fall of water,\r\noccasioned by the piers of bridges built across a river, was much\r\ntalked of at London, on account of the fall that it was supposed would\r\nbe at the new bridge to be built at Westminster. In Mr. Hawksmore’s\r\nand Mr. Labelye’s pamphlets, the former published in 1736, and the\r\nlatter in 1739, the result of Mr. Labelye’s computations was given: but\r\nneither the investigation of the problem, nor any rules, were at that\r\ntime exhibited to the public.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1742 was published Gardiner’s edition of Vlacq’s Tables;\r\nin which, among the examples there prefixed to shew some of the\r\nuses of those tables drawn up by the late William Jones, Esq; there\r\nare two examples, one shewing how to compute the fall of water at\r\nLondon-bridge, and the other applied to Westminster-bridge: but that\r\nexcellent mathematician’s investigation of the rule, by which those\r\nexamples were wrought, was not printed, altho’ he communicated to\r\nseveral of his friends copies thereof. Since that time, it seems as\r\nif the problem had in general been forgot, as it has not made its\r\nappearance, to my knowlege, in any of the subsequent publications. As\r\nit is a problem somewhat curious, tho’ not difficult, and its solution\r\nnot generally known (having seen four different solutions, one of them\r\nvery imperfect, extracted from the private books of an office in one of\r\nthe departments of engineering in a neighbouring nation), I thought it\r\nmight give some entertainment to the curious in these matters, if the\r\nwhole process were published. In the following investigation, much the\r\nsame with Mr. Jones’s, as the demonstrations of the principles therein\r\nused appeared to be wanting, they are here attempted to be supplied.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPLES.\r\n\r\nI. _A heavy body, that in the first second of time has fallen the\r\nheight of a feet, has acquired such a velocity, that, moving uniformly\r\ntherewith, will in the next second of time move the length of 2 a feet._\r\n\r\nII. _The spaces run thro’ by falling bodies are proportional to one\r\nanother as the squares of their last or acquired velocities._\r\n\r\n These two principles are demonstrated by the writers on mechanics.\r\n\r\nIII. _Water forced out of a larger chanel thro’ one or more smaller\r\npassages, will have the streams thro’ those passages contracted in the\r\nratio of 25 to 21._\r\n\r\n This is shewn in the 36th prop. of the 2d book of Newton’s Principia.\r\n\r\nIV. _In any stream of water, the velocity is such, as would be acquired\r\nby the fall of a body from a height above the surface of that stream._\r\n\r\n This is evident from the nature of motion.\r\n\r\nV. _The velocities of water thro’ different passages of the same\r\nheight, are reciprocally proportional to their breadths._\r\n\r\n  For, at some time, the water must be delivered as fast as it comes;\r\n  otherwise the bounds would be overflowed.\r\n\r\n  At that time, the same quantity, which in any time flows thro’ a\r\n  section in the open chanel, is delivered in equal time thro’ the\r\n  narrower passages; or the momentum in the narrow passages must be\r\n  equal to the momentum in the open chanel; or the rectangle under the\r\n  section of the narrow passages, by their mean velocity, must be equal\r\n  to the rectangle under the section of the open chanel by its mean\r\n  velocity.\r\n\r\n  Therefore the velocity in the open chanel is to the velocity in the\r\n  narrower passages, as the section of those passages is to the section\r\n  of the open chanel.\r\n\r\n  But the heights in both sections being equal, the sections are\r\n  directly as the breadths;\r\n\r\n  Consequently the velocities are reciprocally as the breadths.\r\n\r\nVI. _In a running stream, the water above any obstacles put therein\r\nwill rise to such a height, that by its fall the stream may be\r\ndischarged as fast as it comes._\r\n\r\n  For the same body of water, which flowed in the open chanel, must\r\n  pass thro’ the passages made by the obstacles:\r\n\r\n  And the narrower the passages, the swifter will be the velocity of\r\n  the water:\r\n\r\n  But the swifter the velocity of the water, the greater is the height,\r\n  from whence it has descended:\r\n\r\n  Consequently the obstacles, which contract the chanel, cause the\r\n  water to rise against them.\r\n\r\n  But the rise will cease, when the water can run off as fast as it\r\n  comes:\r\n\r\n  And this must happen, when, by the fall between the obstacles, the\r\n  water will acquire a velocity in a reciprocal proportion to that in\r\n  the open chanel as the breadth of the open chanel is to the breadth\r\n  of the narrow passages.\r\n\r\nVII. _The quantity of the fall caused by an obstacle in a running\r\nstream is measured by the difference between the heights fallen from\r\nto acquire the velocities in the narrow passages and open chanel._\r\n\r\n  For just above the fall, the velocity of the stream is such, as would\r\n  be acquired by a body falling from a height higher than the surface\r\n  of the water:\r\n\r\n  And at the fall, the velocity of the stream is such, as would be\r\n  acquired by the fall of a body from a height more elevated than the\r\n  top of the falling stream; and consequently the real fall is less\r\n  than this height.\r\n\r\n  Now as the stream comes to the fall with a velocity belonging to a\r\n  fall above its surface;\r\n\r\n  Consequently the height belonging to the velocity at the fall must be\r\n  diminished by the height belonging to the velocity, with which the\r\n  stream arrives at the fall.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROBLEM.\r\n\r\n_In a chanel of running water, whose breadth is contracted by one or\r\nmore obstacles; the breadth of the chanel, the mean velocity of the\r\nwhole stream, and the breadth of the water-way between the obstacles\r\nbeing given; To find the quantity of the fall occasioned by those\r\nobstacles._\r\n\r\n  Let _b_ = breadth of the chanel in feet.\r\n      _v_ = mean velocity of the water in feet per sec.\r\n      _c_ = breadth of the water-way between the obstacles.\r\n\r\nNow 25: 21∷ _c_: 21 ⁄ 25 _c_ the water-way contracted. _Principle III._\r\n\r\nAnd 21 ⁄ 25 _c_: _b_∷ _v_: 25_b_ ⁄ 21_c_ _v_ the veloc. _per_ sec. in\r\nthe water-way between the obstacles. _Princip. V._\r\n\r\nAlso (2_a_)²: _vv_∷ _a_: _vv_ ⁄ 4_a_ the height fallen to acquire the\r\nvel. v. I. & II.\r\n\r\nAnd (2_a_)²: (25_b_ ⁄ 21_c_)² × _vv_∷ _a_: (25_b_ ⁄ 21_c_)² × _vv_ ⁄\r\n4_a_ the height fallen to acquire the vel. 25_b_ ⁄ 21_c_ _v_. I. & II.\r\n\r\nThen (25_b_ ⁄ 21_c_)² x (_vv_ ⁄ 4_a_) - (_vv_ ⁄ 4_a_) is the measure of\r\nthe fall required. VII.\r\n\r\nOr ((25_b_ ⁄ 21_c_)² - 1) × _vv_ ⁄ 4_a_ is a rule, by which the fall\r\nmay be readily computed.\r\n\r\nHere _a_ = 16,0899 feet and 4_a_ = 64,3596.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE I. _For London-Bridge._\r\n\r\nBy the observations made by Mr. Labelye in 1746,\r\n\r\nThe breadth of the Thames at London-bridge is 926 feet;\r\n\r\nThe sum of the water-ways at the time of the greatest fall is 236 feet;\r\n\r\nThe mean velocity of the stream taken at its surface just above bridge\r\nis 3⅙ feet _per_ second.\r\n\r\nUnder almost all the arches there are great numbers of drip-shot piles,\r\nor piles driven into the bed of the water-way, to prevent it from being\r\nwashed away by the fall. These drip-shot piles considerably contract\r\nthe water-ways, at least ⅙ of their measured breadth, or about 39⅓ feet\r\nin the whole.\r\n\r\nSo that the water-way will be reduced to 196⅔ feet.\r\n\r\nNow _b_ = 926; _c_ = 196⅔; _v_ = 3⅙; 4_a_ = 64,3596.\r\n\r\nThen 25_b_ ⁄ 21_c_ = 23150 ⁄ 4130 = 5,60532.\r\n\r\nAnd 5,60532² = 31,4196; and 31,4196 - 1 = 30,4196 = (25_b_ ⁄ 21_c_)² -\r\n1.\r\n\r\nAlso _vv_ = (19 ⁄ 6)² = 361 ⁄ 36; And _vv_ ⁄ 4_a_ = 361 ⁄ (36 ×\r\n64,3596) = 0,15581.\r\n\r\nThen 30,4196 × 0,15581 = 4,739 feet, the fall sought after.\r\n\r\nBy the most exact observations made about the year 1736, the measure of\r\nthe fall was 4 feet 9 inches.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE II. _For Westminster-Bridge._\r\n\r\nAltho’ the breadth of the river at Westminster-bridge is 1220 feet;\r\nyet, at the time of the greatest fall, there is water thro’ only the\r\nthirteen large arches, which amount to 820 feet: to which adding the\r\nbreadth of the twelve intermediate piers, equal to 174 feet, gives 994\r\nfor the breadth of the river at that time: and the velocity of the\r\nwater just above bridge (from many experiments) is not greater than 2¼\r\nfeet _per_ second.\r\n\r\nHere _b_ = 994; _c_ = 820; _v_ = 2¼; 4_a_ = 64,3596.\r\n\r\nNow 25_b_ ⁄ 21_c_ = 24850 ⁄ 17220 = 1,443.\r\n\r\nAnd 1,443² = 2,082; And 2,082 - 1 = 1,082 = (25_b_ ⁄ 21_c_)² - 1.\r\n\r\nAlso _vv_ = (⁹⁄₄)² = ⁸¹⁄₁₆; And _vv_ ⁄ 48 = 81 ⁄ (16 × 64,3696) =\r\n0,0786.\r\n\r\nThen 1,082 × 0,0786 = 0,084 feet, the fall sought.\r\n\r\nWhich is about 1 inch; and is about half an inch more than the greatest\r\nfall observed by Mr. Labelye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIV. _An Account of the Earthquake in the West Parts of_ Cornwall,\r\nJuly _15th 1757. By the Rev._ William Borlase, _M. A. F.R.S.\r\nCommunicated by the Rev._ Charles Lyttelton, _LL.D. Dean of_ Exeter,\r\n_F.R.S._\r\n\r\n[Read Jan. 26, 1758.]\r\n\r\nON Friday the 15th of July, 1757. a violent shock of an earthquake was\r\nfelt in the western parts of Cornwall.\r\n\r\nThe thermometer had been higher than usual, and the weather hot, or\r\ncalm, or both, for eight days before; wind east and north-east. On the\r\n14th in the morning, the wind shifting to the south-west, the weather\r\ncalm and hazy, there was a shower. The afternoon hazy and fair, wind\r\nnorth-west. The barometer moderately high, but the mercury remarkably\r\nvariable.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th in the morning, the wind fresh at north-west, the\r\natmosphere hazy. Being on the sands, half a mile east of Penzance, at\r\n10 A. M. near low water, I perceived on the surface of the sands a\r\nvery unusual inequality: for whereas there are seldom any unevennesses\r\nthere, but what are made by the rippling of the water, I found the\r\nsands, for above 100 yards square, all full of little tubercles (each\r\nas large as a moderate mole-hill), and in the middle a black speck on\r\nthe top, as if something had issued thence. Between these convexities\r\nwere hollow basons of an equal diameter. From one of these hollows\r\nthere issued a strong rush of water, about the bigness of a man’s\r\nwrist, never observed there before nor since.\r\n\r\nAbout a quarter after six, P. M. the sky dusky, the wind being at west\r\nnorth-west, it fell quite calm. At half past six, being then in the\r\nsummer-house at Keneggy, the seat of the Hon. J. Harris, Esq; near\r\nPenzance, with some company, we were suddenly alarmed with a rumbling\r\nnoise, as if a coach or waggon had passed near us over an uneven\r\npavement; but the noise was as loud in the beginning and at the end,\r\nas in the middle; which neither the sound of thunder, or of carriages,\r\never is. The sash-casements jarred: one gentleman thought his chair\r\nmoved under him; and the gardener, then in the dwelling house (about an\r\nhundred yards distant from us) felt the stone pavement of the room he\r\nwas in move very sensibly.\r\n\r\nIn what place the shock began, and whether progressive or instantaneous\r\nin the several places where it was felt, is uncertain, for want of\r\naccurately determining the precise point of time in distant places.\r\n\r\nThe shock was not equally loud or violent. Its extent was from the\r\nisles of Scilly eastward as far as Liskerd, and towards the north as\r\nfar as Camelford; thro’ which district I shall trace it, according to\r\nthe best informations I could procure.\r\n\r\nIn the island of St. Mary, Scilly, the shock was violent. On the\r\nshores of Cornwall, opposite to Scilly (in the parish of Senan, near\r\nthe Land’s-end) the noise was heard like that of a spinning-wheel on\r\na chamber-floor. Below stairs there was a cry, that the house was\r\nshaking; and the brass pans and pewter rattled one against another\r\nin several houses in the same parish. In the adjoining parish of\r\nSt. Just, two young men being then swimming, felt a strong and very\r\nunusual agitation of the sea. In the town of Penzance, in one house\r\nthe chamber-bell rung; in another the pewter plates, placed edgeways\r\non a shelf, shifted, and slid to one end of the shelf: and it was\r\nevery-where perceived more or less, according as people’s attention was\r\nengaged.\r\n\r\nAt Trevailer, the seat of William Veale, Esquire, about two miles from\r\nPenzance, the noise was heard, and thought at first to be thunder:\r\nthe windows shook, and the walls of the parlour, where Mr. Veale\r\nsat, visibly moved. The jarring of the windows continued near half a\r\nminute; but the motion of the walls not quite so long: and some masons,\r\nbeing at work on a contiguous new building, the upright poles of the\r\nscaffolds shook so violently, that, for fear of falling, they laid\r\nhold on the walls, which, to their still greater surprize, they found\r\nagitated in the same manner. And a person present, who was at London\r\nat the time of the two shocks in the year 1751, thought this shock to\r\nresemble the second, both in degree and duration[10].\r\n\r\nAt Marazion, the next market-town east of Penzance, the houses of\r\nseveral persons shook to that degree, that people ran out into the\r\nstreet, lest the houses should fall upon them.\r\n\r\nIn the borough of St. Ives, on the north sea, six miles north of\r\nPenzance, the shock was so violent, that a gentleman, who had been at\r\nLisbon during several shocks, said, that this exceeded all he had met\r\nwith, except that on the 1st of November 1755, so fatal to that city.\r\n\r\nAt Tehidy, the seat of Francis Basset, Esq; the rooms shook, and\r\nthe grounds without doors were observed to move. The shock was felt\r\nsensibly at Redruth, St. Columb, Bodman, _&c._ along to Camelford,\r\nwhich is about 90 miles from the isle of Scilly. From Marazion eastward\r\nit was felt at several places in like manner, as far as Lostwythyel;\r\nbut at Liskerd, about ten miles east of Lostwythyel, it was but faintly\r\nperceived, and that by a few persons. It was still less sensible at Loo\r\nand Plymouth, “scarcely sufficient to excite curiosity or fear”[11].\r\n\r\nThe times of its duration were various. At Keneggy we thought the noise\r\ncould not have lasted above six seconds; at Trevailer, not two miles\r\ndistant to the west, it was thought to have lasted near half a minute;\r\nin the parish of Gwynier half a minute; at Ludgvan, three miles east\r\nof Penzance, the noise was rather longer than half a minute; but the\r\nshaking felt in the garden, and observed in the houses, short and\r\nmomentary. In Germo great Pinwork, seven miles east of Penzance, it\r\nlasted only a few seconds; but in the isles of Scilly it was computed\r\nat 40 seconds.\r\n\r\nThus was this earthquake felt in towns, houses, and grounds adjacent;\r\nbut still more particularly alarming in our mines, where there is less\r\nrefuge, and consequently a greater dread from the tremors of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn Carnorth adit, in the parish of St. Just, the shock was sensibly\r\nfelt 18 fathom deep; in the mine called Boscadzhill-downs, more than 30\r\nfathom.\r\n\r\nAt Huel-rith mine, in the parish of Lannant, people saw the earth\r\nmove under them, first quick, then in a slower wavy tremor; and\r\nthe stage-boards of the little winds or shafts 20 fathom deep were\r\nperceived to move.\r\n\r\nIn Herland mine, commonly called the Manor, in the parish of Gwynier,\r\nthe noise was heard 55 and 60 fathom deep, as if a studdle[12] had\r\nbroke, and the deads[13] were set a running. It was nothing like the\r\nnoise of thunder.\r\n\r\nIn Chace-water mine the same noise was heard, at least 70 fathom under\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\nAt Huel-rith mine, near Godolphin, the noise was seemingly underneath.\r\nI felt (says the director of the mine) the earth move under me with a\r\nprodigious swift, and apparently horizontal tremor: its continuance was\r\nbut for a few seconds of time, not like thunder, but rather a dull\r\nrumbling even sound, like deads running under ground. In the smith’s\r\nshop the window-leaves shook, and the slating of the house cracked.\r\nThe whim-house shook so terribly, that a man there at work ran out of\r\nit, concluding it to be falling. Several persons then in the mine,\r\nworking 60 fathom deep, thought they found the earth about them to\r\nmove, and heard an uncommon noise: some heard the noise, and felt no\r\ntremor; others, working in a mine adjoining called Huel-breag, were\r\nso frightened, that they called to their companions above to be drawn\r\nup from the bottoms. Their moor-house was shaken, and the padlock of\r\ntheir candle-chest was heard to strike against the staples. To shew,\r\nthat this noise proceeded from below, and not from any concussion in\r\nthe atmosphere above, this very intelligent captain of the mine[14]\r\nobserves, from his own experience, that thunder was never known to\r\naffect the air at 60 fathoms deep, even in a single shaft pierced into\r\nthe hardest stone; much less could it continue the sound thro’ such\r\nworkings as there are in this mine, impeded in all parts with deads,\r\ngreat quantities of timber, various noises, such as the rattling of\r\nchains, friction of wheels and ropes, and dashing of waters; all which\r\nmust contribute to break the vibrations of the air as they descend: and\r\nI intirely agree with this gentleman’s conclusion, that thunder, or any\r\nother noises from above in the atmosphere, could not be heard at half\r\nthe depth of this mine. This therefore could be no other than a real\r\ntremor of the earth, attended with a noise, owing to a current of air\r\nand vapour proceeding upwards from the earth.\r\n\r\nI do not hear of any person in those parts, who was so fortunate as to\r\nbe near any pool or lake, and had recollection enough to attend to the\r\nmotion of the waters; but it may be taken for granted, that during the\r\ntremors of the earth the fluids must be more affected than the solids:\r\nnay, the waters will apparently be agitated, when there is no motion\r\nof the earth perceptible, as was the case of our ponds and lake-waters\r\nin most parts of Britain on the 1st of November 1755. Whence this\r\nhappens is difficult to say: whether the earth’s bosom undergoes at\r\nsuch times a kind of respiration, and alternately emits and withdraws\r\na vapour thro’ its most porous parts sufficient to agitate the waters,\r\nyet not sufficient to shake the earth; or whether the earth, during the\r\nagitation of the waters, does rock and vacillate, tho’ not so as to be\r\nsensible to man; is what I shall leave to future inquiry.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes are very rare in Cornwall. This was but of short duration,\r\nand did no harm any-where, as far as I can learn; and it is to be hoped\r\nnot the sooner forgotten for that reason; but rather remembered with\r\nall the impressions of gratitude suitable to an incident so alarming\r\nand dangerous, and yet so inoffensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXV. _Some Observations upon the Sleep of Plants; and an Account\r\nof that Faculty, which_ Linnæus _calls_ Vigiliæ Florum; _with an\r\nEnumeration of several Plants, which are subject to that Law.\r\nCommunicated to_ Wm. Watson, _M. D. F.R.S. by Mr._ Richard Pultney _of_\r\nLeicester.\r\n\r\n[Read Jan. 26, 1758.]\r\n\r\nACosta and Prosper Alpinus, who both wrote near the conclusion of the\r\nXVIth century, are, I believe, the first, who recorded that nocturnal\r\nchange in the leaves of plants, which has since been called _somnus_.\r\nIt is an observation indeed as old as Pliny’s time, that the leaves of\r\ntrefoil assume an erect situation[15] upon the coming of storms. The\r\nsame is observable of our wood-sorrel; and Linnæus adds, of almost all\r\nplants with declinated stamina[16]. In the _Trifolium pratense album\r\nC. B._ or common white-flowered meadow trefoil, it is so obvious, that\r\nthe common people in Sweden remark, and prognosticate the coming of\r\ntempests and rain from it.\r\n\r\nThe examples of sleeping plants instanced by Alpinus are but few.\r\nThat author says, it was common to several Egyptian species[17];\r\nbut specifies only the Acaciæ, Abrus, Absus, Sesban, and the\r\nTamarindtree. Cornutus some time afterwards remarked this property\r\nin the Pseudo-acacia Americana. From that time it has remained almost\r\nunnoticed, till Linnæus, ever attentive to nature’s works, discovered\r\nthat the same affair was transacted in many other plants; and his\r\nobservations have furnished us with numerous and obvious examples\r\nthereof. Mr. Miller mentions it in the _Medicago arborea Lin. Sp. Pl.\r\n778_. and we may add to the list two other common plants not mentioned\r\nby Linnæus: these are the _Phaseolus vulgaris_, common kidney-bean;\r\nand the _Trifolium pratense purpureum majus_, or clover-grass: in both\r\nwhich this nocturnal change is remarkably displayed. Doubtless the same\r\nproperty exists in numberless other species; and future observation\r\nwill very probably confirm Dr. Hill’s sentiment, that no “plant or tree\r\nis wholly unaffected by it.”\r\n\r\nIt is now more than twenty years since Linnæus first attended to this\r\nquality in plants. In his _Flora Lapponica_, when speaking of the\r\n_Trifolium pratense album_, as above-mentioned, he remarks, that the\r\nleaves of the Mimosa, Cassia, Bauhinia, Parkinsonia, Guilandina, and\r\nothers in affinity with them, were subject to this change in the night\r\ntime: and he had then carried his observations so far, as to find, that\r\nheat and cold were not the cause of this quality; since they were alike\r\ninfluenced by it when placed in stoves, where the temperature of the\r\nair was always the same.\r\n\r\nThe merit of reviving this subject is therefore due to the illustrious\r\nSwede; and the naturalist is greatly indebted to him for so far\r\nextending his observations thereon.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the _somnus plantarum_ cannot but be highly entertaining\r\nto the lovers of natural knowlege: and such, I apprehend, cannot be\r\nless entertained with that faculty, which Linnæus calls _vigiliæ\r\nflorum_; of which we shall give a brief account.\r\n\r\nPrevious to our explanation of this affair it is proper to observe,\r\nthat the flowers of most plants, after they are once opened, continue\r\nso night and day, until they drop off, or die away. Several others,\r\nwhich shut in the night-time, open in the morning either sooner or\r\nlater, according to their respective situation in the sun or shade,\r\nor as they are influenced by the manifest changes of the atmosphere.\r\nThere are however another class of flowers, which make the subject of\r\nthese observations, which observe a more constant and uniform law in\r\nthis particular. These open and shut duly and constantly at certain and\r\ndeterminate hours, exclusive of any manifest changes in the atmosphere;\r\nand this with so little variation in point of time, as to render the\r\nphænomenon well worth the observation of all, whose taste leads them\r\nthis way.\r\n\r\nThis faculty in the flowers of plants is not altogether a new\r\ndiscovery; but we are indebted to the same hand for additional\r\nobservations upon this head likewise. It is so manifest in one of our\r\ncommon English plants, the _Tragopogon luteum_, that our country people\r\nlong since called it _John-go-to-bed-at-noon_. Linnæus’s observations\r\nhave extended to near fifty species, which are subject to this law.\r\nWhat we find principally upon this subject is in the _Philosophia\r\nBotanica_, p. 273. We will enumerate these plants, and mention the\r\ntime when the flowers open and shut, that those, who have opportunity\r\nand inclination, may gratify themselves, and probably at the same time\r\nextend this branch of botanic knowlege still farther.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to observe, that as these observations were made by\r\nLinnæus in the academical garden at Upsal, whoever repeats them in\r\nthis country will very probably find, that the difference of climate\r\nwill occasion a variation in point of time: at least this will obtain\r\nin some species, as our own observations have taught us; in others the\r\ntime has corresponded very exactly with the account he has given us.\r\n\r\nWhether this faculty hath any connexion with the great article of\r\nfecundation in the oeconomy of flowers, I cannot determine: in the\r\nmean time it is not improbable. Future and repeated observations, and\r\nwell-adapted experiments, will tend to illustrate this matter, and it\r\nmay be lead the way to a full explanation of the cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

By the Rev._ Richard Oram, _M. A.\r\nChaplain to the Lord Bishop of_ Ely.\r\n\r\n[Read Jan. 26, 1758.]\r\n\r\nJOseph, son of John and Mary Postle, of Ingham in the county of\r\nNorfolk, was subject to convulsive fits from his infancy; which were\r\ncommon and tolerable till he was about seven years of age. About\r\nthat time they began to attack him in all the varieties that can be\r\nconceived. Sometimes he was thrown upon the ground; sometimes he was\r\ntwirled round like a top by them; at others he would spring upwards\r\nto a considerable height, _&c._ and once he leaped over an iron bar,\r\nthat was placed purposely before the fire to prevent his falling into\r\nit. He was much burned; but was rendered so habitually stupid by his\r\nfits, that he never expressed the least sense of pain after this\r\naccident. His intellect was so much impaired, and almost destroyed,\r\nby the frequency and violence of his fits, that he scarce seemed\r\nto be conscious of any thing. He did not acknowlege his father or\r\nmother by any expressions or signs; nor seemed to distinguish them\r\nfrom other people. If at any time he escaped out of the house without\r\nthe observation of the family, he had not understanding to find and\r\nreturn to it; but would pursue the direction or road he first took,\r\nand sometimes lose himself. Once he was missing for a whole night; and\r\nfound the next morning in the middle of a fen, stuck fast in mud as\r\ndeep as his breast. He was very voracious, and would frequently call\r\nfor something to eat; which was the only indication he gave of his\r\nknowing any thing. No kind of filth or nastiness can be conceived,\r\nwhich he would not eat or drink without distinction. He appeared to be\r\nas ill as he really was; for he was become a most shocking spectacle.\r\nHe was so much emaciated, that he seemed to have no flesh upon his\r\nbones; and his body so distorted, that he was rendered quite a cripple.\r\nHis parents consulted a physician at Norwich, who very judiciously (as\r\nit will appear) considered his disorder as a worm-case, and prescribed\r\nfor it accordingly; but (being afraid, I presume, to give too violent\r\nmedicines to the boy) without success. In short, he was so singularly\r\nafflicted, that his parents told me they could not help thinking him\r\nunder some evil influence.\r\n\r\nIt was observed, that his disorder varied, and grew worse, at certain\r\nperiods of the moon.\r\n\r\nIn these miserable circumstances the poor boy continued to languish,\r\ntill he was about eleven years of age (July 1757), when he accidentally\r\nfound a mixture of white lead[18] and oil, which had some time before\r\nbeen prepared for some purpose of painting, set by on a shelf, and\r\nplaced, as it was thought, out of his reach. There was near half a pint\r\nof this mixture when he found it; and, as he did not leave much, it is\r\nthought he swallowed about a quarter of a pint of it. There was also\r\nsome lamp-black in the composition; which was added to give it a proper\r\ncolour for the particular use it was intended for in painting. It was,\r\nas I suppose it usually is, linseed oil, which had been mixed with the\r\nlead and lamp-black.\r\n\r\nThe draught began to operate very soon, by vomiting and purging him for\r\nnear 24 hours in the most violent manner. A large quantity of black\r\ninky matter was discharged; and an infinite number of worms, almost\r\nas small as threads, were voided. These operations were so intense,\r\nthat his life was despaired of. But he has not only survived them, but\r\nexperienced a most wonderful change and improvement after them: for his\r\nparents assured me in November 1757, when I saw him, that he had daily\r\ngrown better from the time of his drinking the mixture, both in body\r\nand mind. Instead of a skeleton, as he almost was before, he is become\r\nfat, and rather corpulent: and his appetite is no longer ravenous, but\r\nmoderate and common. His body too is become straight and erect. His\r\nunderstanding is at least as much benefited by this peculiar remedy. It\r\ncannot be expected, that he should already have attained much knowlege,\r\nas he seemed, before he was so wonderfully relieved, to be almost\r\ndestitute of ideas. But he appeared, when I saw him, to have acquired\r\nnearly as much knowlege in four months, as children usually do in four\r\nyears; and to reason pretty well on those things, which he knew. He is\r\nnow capable of being employed on many occasions; is often sent a mile\r\nor two on errands, which he discharges as carefully, and then returns\r\nas safely, as any person.\r\n\r\nIt is farther remarkable, that the boy’s mother, her father, and\r\nsister, are frequently infested with worms. Her father, tho’ about 60\r\nyears of age, is still much troubled with them: the worms, which he\r\nvoids, appear flat, and much larger than those, which his children have\r\nobserved. Her sister is often exceedingly disordered by them. About\r\nthree months since they threw her into violent convulsions, and for\r\nsome time deprived her of her senses. But the mother of the boy has\r\nbeen affected in a more extraordinary manner than the rest. About 20\r\nyears ago she voided some worms, which forced their way thro’ the pores\r\nof the skin, as it is supposed; for they were found in small clusters\r\nunder her arms. As she was very young then, she does not remember\r\nhow she was particularly affected; only, that she suffered violent\r\nstruggles and convulsions. She is still, about five or six times in a\r\nyear, seized with fainting fits, which usually attack her in bed, and\r\nlast three or four minutes; but she cannot certainly say, tho’ there is\r\nvery little reason to doubt, that they are occasioned by worms.\r\n\r\n\r\n_An Account of the same Subject, in a Letter from Mr._ John Gaze, _of_\r\nWalket, _in the County of_ Norfolk, _to Mr._ Wm. Arderon, _F.R.S.\r\nCommunicated by Mr._ Henry Baker, _F.R.S._\r\n\r\n[Read Jan. 26, 1758.]\r\n\r\nJOseph Postle, son of John Postle, of Ingham in Norfolk, until about\r\nthe age of seven years was an healthy well-looking child; but about\r\nthat age was afflicted with stoppages, which often threw him into\r\nconvulsive fits, and at last rendered him quite an idiot. He continued\r\nin this condition for about four years, eating and drinking all that\r\ntime any thing that came in his way, even his own excrements, if\r\nnot narrowly watched. His father took the advice of several eminent\r\nphysicians, both at Norwich and elsewhere; but all their prescriptions\r\nproved of no service.\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of August last he happened to get at a\r\npainting-pot, wherein there was about a pound of white lead and\r\nlamp-black mixed up with linseed oil. This he eat almost all up\r\nbefore he was discovered. It vomited and purged him, and brought away\r\nprodigious numbers of small worms. In a few days he grew well, his\r\nsenses returned, and he is now able to give as rational answers as can\r\nbe expected from a boy of his age. His appetite is good, he is very\r\nbrisk, and has not had the least return of his former disorder.\r\n\r\nI heard of the above by several people; but not being satisfied, got\r\nmy friend to go to Mr. Postle’s house, of whom he had the foregoing\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nJanuary 12th, 1758.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXVII. _An Account of the extraordinary Heat of the Weather in_ July\r\n1757, _and of the Effects of it. In a Letter from_ John Huxham, _M. D.\r\nF.R.S. to_ Wm. Watson, _M. D. F.R.S._\r\n\r\n[Read Feb. 2, 1758.]\r\n\r\nI Find by your letter, that the heat at London was not so great in\r\nthe beginning of July 1757, as at Plymouth by two or three degrees of\r\nFahrenheit’s thermometer. We had again, after much rain at the close\r\nof the month, and in the beginning of August, excessive heat; _viz._\r\non the 8th, 9th, and 10th of August; which mounted the mercury in that\r\nthermometer to 85; nay, on the 9th, to near 86. I never before remember\r\nthe mercury in that thermometer to exceed 84; and that is even here a\r\nvery extraordinary degree of heat.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of this extremely hot season were hæmorrhages from\r\nseveral parts of the body; the nose especially in men and children,\r\nand the uterus in women. Sudden and violent pains of the head, and\r\nvertigo, profuse sweats, great debility and oppression of the spirits,\r\naffected many. There were putrid fevers in great abundance; and a vast\r\nquantity of fluxes of the belly both bilious and bloody, with which the\r\nfevers also were commonly attended. These fevers were always ushered\r\nin by severe pains of the head, back, and stomach; vomitings of green\r\nand sometimes of black bile, with vast oppression of the _præcordia_,\r\ncontinual anxiety, and want of sleep. These were soon succeeded by\r\n_tremores tendinum_, _subsultus_, delirium, or stupor. The pulse was\r\ncommonly very quick, but seldom tense or strong; was sometimes heavy\r\nand undose. The blood oftentimes florid, but loose; sometimes livid,\r\nvery rarely sizy: in some however, at the very attack, it was pretty\r\ndense and florid. The tongue was generally foul, brown, and sometimes\r\nblackish; and towards the crisis often dry. The urine was commonly high\r\ncoloured, and in small quantity; frequently turbid, and towards the end\r\ndeposed a great deal of lateritious sediment. A vast number were seized\r\nwith this fever, during, and soon after, the excessive heats; tho’ but\r\nfew died in proportion. Long and great heats always very much exalt the\r\nacrimony of the bilious humours; of which we had this summer abundant\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\nBleeding early was generally beneficial; profuse, always hurtful,\r\nespecially near the state of the fever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXVIII. _An Account of the fossile Thigh-bone of a large Animal, dug up\r\nat_ Stonesfield, _near_ Woodstock, _in_ Oxfordshire. _In a Letter to\r\nMr._ Peter Collinson, _F.R.S. from Mr._ Joshua Platt.\r\n\r\n[Read Feb. 2, 1758.]\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nABOUT three years ago I sent you some _vertebræ_ of an enormous size,\r\nwhich were found in the slate-stone pit at Stonesfield, near Woodstock,\r\nin this county.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Philos. Trans. Vol. L._ TAB. XIX. _p. 525_.\r\n\r\n_J. Mynde sc._]\r\n\r\nI have lately been so lucky as to procure from the same place the\r\nthigh-bone of a large animal, which probably belonged to the same\r\ncreature, or one of the same genus, with the _vertebræ_ above-mentioned.\r\n\r\nAs the bone, and the stone, in which it is bedded, weigh no less than\r\ntwo hundred pounds, I have sent you a drawing of it (_See_ TAB. XIX.);\r\nfrom which, and the following short description, you may, I hope, form\r\nsome idea of this wonderful fossile.\r\n\r\nThe bone is 29 inches in length; its diameter, at the extremity of\r\nthe two trochanters, is 8 inches; at the lower extremity the condyles\r\nform a surface of 6 inches. The lesser trochanter is so well expressed\r\nin the drawing, that you cannot mistake it; and both the extremities\r\nappear to be a little rubbed by the fluctuating water, in which I\r\napprehend it lay some time before the great jumble obtained, which\r\nbrought it to this place; and from whence I imagine it to have been\r\npart of a skeleton before the flood. For if it had been corroded by any\r\nmenstruum in the earth, or during the great conflux of water before the\r\ndraining of the earth, it must have suffered in other parts as well as\r\nat each end: but as the extremities only are injured, we can attribute\r\nsuch a partial effect to the motion of the water only, which caused it\r\nto rub and strike against the sand, _&c._\r\n\r\nThe small trochanter was broken in lifting it out of the hamper, in\r\nwhich it was brought to me; but not unhappily; since all the _cancelli_\r\nwere by that means discovered to be filled with a sparry matter, that\r\nfixed the stone of the stratum, in which it lay. The outward coat or\r\ncortex is smooth, and of a dusky brown colour, resembling that of the\r\nstone, in which it is bedded.\r\n\r\nOne half of the bone is buried in the stone; yet enough of it is\r\nexposed to shew, that it is the thigh-bone of an animal of greater bulk\r\nthan the largest ox. I have compared it with the recent thigh-bone of\r\nan elephant; but could observe little or no resemblance between them.\r\nIf I may be allowed to assume the liberty, in which fossilists are\r\noften indulged, and to hazard a vague conjecture of my own, I would say\r\nit may probably have belonged to the hippopotamus, to the rhinoceros,\r\nor some such large animal, of whose anatomy we have not yet a competent\r\nknowlege.\r\n\r\nThe slate-pit, in which this bone was found, is about a quarter of\r\na mile north-west from Stonesfield, upon the declivity of a rising\r\nground, the upper stratum of which is a vegetable mould about eight\r\nor ten inches thick: under this is a bed of rubble, with a mixture of\r\nsand and clay, very coarse, about six feet deep, in which are a great\r\nnumber of _anomiæ_ both plain and striated, and many small oblong\r\noysters, which the workmen call the sickle-oyster, some of them being\r\nfound crooked, and bearing some resemblance to that instrument; but all\r\ndiffering from the _curvi-rostra_[19] of Moreton.\r\n\r\nImmediately under this stratum of rubble is a bed of soft grey stone,\r\nof no use; but containing the _echini ovarii_, with great _mamillæ_,\r\nthe _clypeati_ of different sizes, all well preserved; and also many\r\n_anomiæ_ and _pectines_. This bed, which is about seven or eight feet\r\nin depth, lies immediately above the stratum of stone, in which the\r\nbone was found.\r\n\r\nThis stratum is never wrought by the workmen, being arenarious, and too\r\nsoft for their use. It is about four or five feet thick, and forms a\r\nkind of roof to them, as they dig out the stone, of which the slates\r\nare formed; for they work these pits in the same manner as they do the\r\ncoal-pits, leaving pillars at proper distances to keep their roof from\r\nfalling in.\r\n\r\nThis last bed of slate-stone is about five feet depth, and lower than\r\nthis they never dig. So that the whole depth of the pit amounts to\r\nabout 24 or 25 feet.\r\n\r\nIt was by working out the slate-stone, that this bone was discovered\r\nsticking to the roof of the pit, where the men were pursuing their\r\nwork; and with a great deal of caution, and no less pains, they got it\r\ndown intire, but attached to a large piece of stone; and in this state\r\nit now remains in my possession.\r\n\r\nThere is no water in the works, but such as descends from the surface\r\nthro’ perpendicular fissures; and the whole is spent in forming the\r\nstalactites and stalagmites, of which there is great variety, and whose\r\ndimensions are constantly increasing. One of the workmen has been so\r\ncurious, as to mark the time of the growth of some of them for several\r\nyears past.\r\n\r\nI am, with the greatest esteem,\r\n\r\n                               Dear Sir,\r\n                          Your ever obedient,\r\n                       and most humble Servant,\r\n                             Joshua Platt.\r\n\r\nOxon, Jan. 20. 1758.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIX. _A Discourse on the Usefulness of Inoculation of the horned\r\nCattle to prevent the contagious Distemper among them. In a Letter to\r\nthe Right Hon._ George _Earl of_ Macclesfield, _P. R. S. from_ Daniel\r\nPeter Layard, _M. D. F.R.S._\r\n\r\n[Read Feb. 2, 1758.]\r\n\r\nMy Lord,\r\n\r\nTHE honour you have done me, in condescending to peruse my Essay on the\r\ncontagious Distemper among the horned Cattle, claims my most respectful\r\nthanks; and I am no less obliged to your Lordship for the just remark\r\nyou made, “That before inoculation could be practised on the horned\r\nCattle, it is necessary to bring proofs, that this disease is not\r\nsusceptible more than once; and also assurances, that a recovery from\r\nthe distemper by inoculation guards the beast from a second infection.”\r\n\r\nAn intire conviction of the analogy between this disease and the\r\nsmall-pox would not permit me to omit mentioning the great advantages,\r\nwhich must arise from inoculation; and therefore, my Lord, I recommend\r\nits use: nor do I find any reason to alter my opinion, after having\r\ncarefully read over what has been published, and made the strictest\r\ninquiry I was able in several parts of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nI shall, in the concisest manner possible, submit the following\r\nparticulars to your Lordship’s consideration, and the learned Society,\r\nover which you so deservedly preside.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de Courtivron, in two memoirs read before the Royal\r\nAcademy of Sciences in the year 1748, and published by that learned\r\nbody, relates the observations he, together with Monsieur Pelversier\r\nde Gombeau, formerly surgeon to the regiment de la Sarre, made on\r\nthe rise, progress, and fatality, of the contagious distemper at\r\nIssurtille, a town in Burgundy; to which are added experiments they\r\nmade, by application, digestion, and inoculation, towards communicating\r\nthe disease; and concludes from the failure of these attempts, that the\r\ndistemper can only be communicated from one beast to another. Besides,\r\nnotwithstanding the Marquis observes[20] the regularity of the illness,\r\nthe critical days, on the seventh and ninth, and particularly that all\r\nsuch as recovered had more or fewer pustules broke out in different\r\nparts of the body; yet[21] he will not allow of Rammazzini’s opinion,\r\nof the analogy between this distemper and the small-pox, nor that it is\r\nan eruptive fever; but ranks it as a plague.\r\n\r\nBut the Marquis goes still farther. He positively say,[22] “That in\r\nthe preceding years, in the provinces of Bresse, Maconnois, and Bugey,\r\nsome private persons had suffered by buying cattle recovered from the\r\ndistemper, which had, at that time, the pustules remaining on them:\r\nwhich cattle had the distemper afterwards.” Nay, he adds that “even\r\nafter recovering twice, a third infection has seized and killed many.”\r\n\r\nNo wonder, my Lord, that such positive assertions should stagger, and\r\ncause the practice of inoculation not to be received, till the nature\r\nof the disease be absolutely determined, and facts prove the contrary\r\nof what has been asserted.\r\n\r\nIn a matter of so great importance to every nation, it were to\r\nbe wished, that the Marquis de Courtivron had produced attested\r\nobservations of these second and third infections: for tho’ a nobleman\r\nof his rank, character, and great abilities, would not willingly impose\r\nupon the world; yet it may happen, that he may have received wrong\r\ninformations.\r\n\r\nAs to the nature, rise, progress, and fatality, of this distemper\r\nat Issurtille, it appears to be the same disease as raged in these\r\nkingdoms. All the symptoms agree, as described by Rammazzini, Lancisi,\r\nthe Marquis, and in my Essay. A distempered beast gave rise to the\r\nthree infections. The illness was every-where the same in Italy,\r\nFrance, and Britain; and either terminated _fatally_ on the fourth or\r\nfifth day, when a scouring prevented the salutary eruptions, or in\r\nsome cases by abortion; and on the seventh or ninth _favourably_, when\r\nthe pustules had regularly taken their course. Tho’ the Marquis did\r\nnot observe, that any particular medicines were of use, he says, that\r\nin general acids were beneficial, especially poor thin wines somewhat\r\nsour; and that the distempered beasts were all fond of these acids[23].\r\n\r\nThe fatality was likewise the same, as will appear from the Marquis’s\r\ntables. Of 192 head of cattle, 176 died. The mortality was chiefly\r\namong the fat cattle, cows with calf, and young sucking or yearling\r\ncalves; and of the surviving sixteen, only two calves out of\r\nseventy-seven lived, and these two, with seven other beasts of the\r\nsixteen, escaped the infection, tho’ constantly among the diseased: so\r\nthat it is plain,\r\n\r\n  Of 192 beasts, 176 died\r\n                   7 recovered\r\n                   9 escaped the infection.\r\n                 ---\r\n                 192\r\n\r\nThe mortality was as considerable in these kingdoms.\r\n\r\nWhoever will compare the appearances, progress, and fatality, of the\r\nsmall-pox, with what is remarked by authors of authority, as Rammazzini\r\nand Lancisi, and other observers, relative to the contagious distemper\r\namong the horned cattle, will not be at a loss one moment to determine,\r\nwhether this disease be an eruptive fever, like unto the small-pox, or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nNow if, as the Marquis has granted in both his memoirs[24], it be a\r\ngeneral observation, that an eruption of pustules on some parts of the\r\nbody, regularly thrown out, digested, and dried, is the means used by\r\nnature to effect the cure; and that in general the morbid matter does\r\nnot affect the parotid, inguinal, or other glands, nor produce large\r\ncarbuncles and abscesses, as the plague does: Nay more, since it is\r\nobserved by the Marquis, that the difference between the contagious\r\ndistemper of 1745 and 1746, and of 1747 and 1748, was, that in the\r\nformer the salutary eruptions appeared, but in the latter were, as he\r\njustly apprehends, checked by the excessive cold weather; and should\r\nit appear, that by inoculation the same regular eruptive fever has\r\nbeen produced, with every stage, and the same symptoms as arise in the\r\nsmall-pox; the nature of this distemper will then be ascertained.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed, my Lord, to lay before your Lordship and the\r\nSociety the accounts I have received relating to the infection\r\nand inoculation of the cattle, and make some observations on the\r\nexperiments made at Issurtille.\r\n\r\nSo long, my Lord, as the distemper has raged in Great Britain, not\r\none attested proof has been brought of any beast having this disease\r\nregularly more than once. I make no doubt but these creatures may be\r\nliable to eruptions of different kinds; but as all sorts of eruptions,\r\nsays Dr. Mead[25], are not the small-pox, nor measles, so every pustule\r\nis not a sign of the plague. Thro’ ignorance, or fraud, persons may\r\nhave been deceived in purchasing cattle, and have lost them, as well\r\nin England as in the provinces of France mentioned by the Marquis; but\r\nuntil a second infection be proved, the general opinion must prevail in\r\nthis case, as in the small-pox: for tho’ many have insisted on the same\r\nthing with regard to the small-pox, yet a single instance, properly\r\nvouched and attested, has never been produced, either after recovery\r\nfrom the natural way, or from inoculation; unless what is frequently\r\nthe case with nurses and others attending the small-pox, that is,\r\npustules breaking out in their arms and face, be allowed as the signs\r\nof a second infection.\r\n\r\nThe farmers and graziers in Huntingdonshire, Cambridgeshire,\r\nLincolnshire, Kent, and Yorkshire, from whence I have written\r\ntestimonies, all agree, that they never knew of a beast having the\r\ncontagious distemper more than once. In this county particularly, Mr.\r\nJ. Mehew, the farmer mentioned in my Essay, has now among his stock\r\nat Godmanchester _eight cows_, which had the contagious distemper the\r\nfirst time it appeared in Godmanchester in 1746. It returned in 1749,\r\n1755, and 1756; the two last not so generally over the town as the two\r\nformer years. All these four times Mr. Mehew suffered by the loss of\r\nhis cattle; yet those _eight cows_, which recovered in 1746, remained\r\nall the while the distemper was in the farm the three years it raged,\r\nwere in the midst of the sick cattle, lay with them in the same barns,\r\neat of the same fodder, nay of such as the distempered beasts had left\r\nand slabbered upon, drank after them, and constantly received their\r\nbreath and steams, without ever being in the least affected. Is not\r\nthis a convincing proof? If in general the cattle be susceptible of a\r\nsecond infection, how comes it, that not one of these _eight_ cows were\r\naffected?\r\n\r\nIn the years abovementioned the distemper spared no beast, but such as\r\nhad recovered from that disease: and this is confirmed to me by Mr.\r\nMehew’s father and brother, all the chief farmers of Godmanchester, and\r\nis the opinion of all the farmers and graziers in Huntingdonshire, who\r\nare so thoroughly convinced of there being no second infection, that\r\nthey are always ready to give an advanced price for such cattle as have\r\nrecovered from the contagious distemper.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Scaife, assistant to the Rev. Dr. Greene, Dean of\r\nSalisbury, in his parish of Cottenham, Cambridgeshire, acquaints me,\r\nthat the farmers in that neighbourhood lost, in 1746 and 1747, twelve\r\nhundred head of cattle, in 1751 four hundred and seventy; and tells me,\r\nthat Mr. Ivett, Sayers, Moor, Dent, Lawson, chief farmers at Cottenham,\r\nMr. Taylor, Sumpter, and Matthews, of his own parish of Histon, and\r\nthe farmers of Wivelingham alias Willingham, unanimously declare, they\r\nnever had one instance of a beast having the distemper twice.\r\n\r\nMr. Thorpe, a farmer and grazier near Gainsborough in Lincolnshire, has\r\nhad beasts recovered from the distemper, which have herded with cattle\r\nfallen ill afterwards, and never met with a single instance of a second\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\nMr. Lostie, an eminent surgeon at Canterbury, has inquired for me of\r\nthe farmers and graziers in that part of Kent, and about Romney-Marsh;\r\nand from whence no belief of a second infection can be had.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Dr. Fountayne, Dean of York, writes me word, that no beast has\r\nbeen known, in his neighbourhood, to have had the distemper twice. And\r\nseveral persons from that county, and others, have told me the same\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nIf the above testimony of persons of character and veracity, together\r\nwith the concurrent persuasion of farmers in general, be allowed of, it\r\nmust be determined, that there is no instance of a second infection.\r\nSupposing now it should appear, that this distemper is regularly, as\r\nin the natural way, tho’ in a milder manner, produced by inoculation,\r\nand that inoculation secures a beast also from a second infection; then\r\nundoubtedly inoculation will be recommendable.\r\n\r\nThe very few trials made in England, and those not with the greatest\r\nexactness or propriety, will yet serve to put this matter out of all\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Dean of York had five beasts inoculated, by means of a skein\r\nof cotton dipped in the matter, and passed thro’ a hole, like a seaton,\r\nin the dew-lap. Of these five, one cow near the time of calving died:\r\nthe other four, after going thro’ the several stages of this contagious\r\ndisease, recovered; two of which, being cows young with calf, did not\r\nslip their calves. All four have herded with distempered cattle a long\r\nwhile, and never had the least symptom of a second infection.\r\n\r\nMr. Bewley, a surgeon of reputation in Lincolnshire, inoculated three\r\nbeasts two years old, for Mr. Wigglesworth of Manton, in the dew-lap,\r\nand with _mucus_ from the nostrils. All three had the regular symptoms\r\nof the contagious distemper in a mild manner, recovered, and tho’ they\r\nherded a twelvemonth after with five or six distempered beasts, they\r\nnever were the least affected. Mr. Bewley also declared to Mr. Thorpe,\r\nthat there never was one instance produced, that he knew of, of a\r\nsecond infection.\r\n\r\nSince it is plain, that notwithstanding neither well-digested _pus_ was\r\nmade use of, nor incisions made in the properest places, and it may be\r\nsupposed few medicines were given; yet inoculation succeeded so as to\r\nbring on the distemper in a regular and mild manner, as appears by the\r\ncows with calf not slipping their calves. One may fairly conclude, that\r\nin this contagious distemper, like unto the small-pox, the practice of\r\ninoculation is not only warrantable, but much to be recommended.\r\n\r\nBut how comes it then, that neither by application, digestion, nor\r\ninoculation, the distemper was not communicated in France?\r\n\r\nThe Marquis says, that this distemper is not communicated but from\r\none beast to another immediately. I must beg leave to say, that to my\r\nknowlege the distemper in February 1756 was carried from the farm-yard,\r\nwhere I visited some distempered cattle, to two other farm-yards, each\r\nat a considerable distance, without any communication of the cattle\r\nwith each other, and merely by the means of servants going to and fro,\r\nor of dogs.\r\n\r\nThe experiments made on four beasts, by tying over their heads part of\r\ndistempered hides, or pieces of linen and woollen cloth or silk, which\r\nhad received the breath and steams of dying cattle, serve to shew, by\r\nthe bullock’s forcing off the cloth tied about him, that the putrid\r\nstench was disagreeable to him; but that neither his blood, nor that of\r\nthe other three beasts, was then in a state to receive the infection.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the pustules, which the Marquis relates were mixed\r\nwith oats and bran, or dissolved in white wine; the distempered bile,\r\nwhich was mixed with milk; milk taken from diseased cows; water, in\r\nwhich part of a distempered hide had been steeped; and the precaution\r\ntaken to force these mixtures into the paunch of calves, by means of\r\na funnel, whose end was covered with a piece of raw distempered skin,\r\nthat the beast might both swallow and suck in the disease. All these\r\nexperiments could have no other effect than what followed; which was,\r\nthat the acrimony of the distempered bile created first a _nausea_, and\r\nthen produced a violent scouring, which killed the beast, leaving marks\r\nof its irritation on the intestines.\r\n\r\nThe practice of inoculation is but lately followed, and even now but\r\nlittle known, in the provinces of France. Its advantages have not long\r\nsince been strangely disputed at Paris. In the case of inoculating\r\ncattle, instead of a slip of raw hide taken from a beast just dead, or\r\nputting a pustule into the neck, they should either have passed in the\r\ndewlap cotton or silk dipped in well-digested _pus_, or have inserted\r\nin proper incisions cotton-thread or silk soaked with _pus_ either on\r\nthe shoulders or buttocks; the true way of inoculating in the English\r\nmanner. Some persons have indeed thought, that to inoculate with the\r\nblood of the infected would answer the intention; but most of the\r\nmodern practitioners chuse to depend on digested matter.\r\n\r\nSeveral constitutions will not receive infection, let them be\r\ninoculated ever so judiciously. A Ranby, a Hawkins, a Middleton, and\r\nother inoculators, will tell us, that the incisions have sometimes\r\nsuppurated so much, and pustules have appeared round the edges of the\r\nwound, without any other particular marks of the disease; and yet the\r\npatient has never had the small-pox afterwards. The Marquis mentions an\r\ninstance somewhat of the same kind in his first Memoir, p. 147.\r\n\r\nThe examination of these very important and interesting particulars\r\nhas, I observe, drawn me into a prolixity, which I fear may prove\r\ntedious to your Lordship: but should I have removed all doubts,\r\nand brought convincing proofs of the absurdity of fearing a second\r\ninfection; should I have shewn inoculation to be a necessary practice,\r\nand that the contagious distemper may be communicated more ways than\r\none; I hope your Lordship will excuse the length of this letter.\r\nI shall only add my earnest wishes, that the legislature may, by\r\neffectual means, prevent the importation of distempered cattle\r\nand hides into these kingdoms; the only means of naturalizing and\r\nperpetuating a dreadful distemper, now, thank God! much decreased among\r\nus.\r\n\r\nI am, with the greatest respect,\r\n\r\n                               My Lord,\r\n                            Your Lordship’s\r\n                Most humble and most obedient Servant,\r\n                         Daniel Peter Layard.\r\n\r\nHuntingdon, 26 Nov. 1757.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXX. _Trigonometry abridged. By the Rev._ Patrick Murdoch, _A. M.\r\nF.R.S._\r\n\r\n[Read Feb. 2, 1758.]\r\n\r\nTHE cases in trigonometry, that can properly be called different from\r\none another are no more than _four_; which may be resolved by _three_\r\ngeneral rules or theorems, expressed in the sines of arcs only; using\r\nthe supplemental triangle as there is occasion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Philos. Trans. Vol. L._ TAB. XX. _p. 539_.\r\n\r\n_J. Mynde sc._]\r\n\r\nCASE I.\r\n\r\n_When of three given parts two stand opposite to each other, and the\r\nthird stands opposite to the part required._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEOREM I.\r\n\r\n_The sines of the sides are proportional to the sines of angles\r\nopposite to them._\r\n\r\n\r\nDEMONSTRATION.\r\n\r\nLet QR (TAB. XX. _Fig._ 1.) be the base of a spherical triangle; its\r\nsides PQ, PR, whose planes cut that of the base in the diameters QC_q_,\r\nRC_r_. And if, from the angle P, the line PL is perpendicular to the\r\nplane of the base, meeting it in L, all planes drawn through PL will\r\nbe perpendicular to the same, by 18. _el._ 11. Let two such planes be\r\nperpendicular likewise to the semicircles of the sides, cutting them in\r\nthe straight lines PG, PH; and the plane of the base in the lines LG,\r\nLH.\r\n\r\nThen the plane of the triangle PGL being perpendicular to the two\r\nplanes, whose intersection is QGC_q_, the angles PGQ LGQ will be right\r\nangles, by 19. _el._ 11. PG likewise subtends a right angle PLG, and\r\nthe angle PGL measures the inclination of the semicircle QP_q_ to the\r\nplane of the base (_def._ 6. _el._ 11.) that is (by 16 _el._ 3. and 10\r\n_el._ 11.) it is equal to the spherical angle PQR: whence PG is to PL\r\nas the radius to the sine of PQR. The same way PL is to PH as the sine\r\nof PRQ is to the radius: and therefore, _ex æquo_. PG the sine of the\r\nside PQ is to PH the sine of PR, as the sine of PRQ is to the sine of\r\nPQR.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASES II. _and_ III.\r\n\r\n_When the three parts are of the same name._\r\n\r\nAnd,\r\n\r\n_When two given parts include between them a given part of a different\r\nname, the part required standing opposite to this middle part._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEOREM II.\r\n\r\n_Let_ S _and_ s _be the sines of two sides of a spherical triangle_,\r\nd _the sine of half the difference of the same sides_, a _the sine of\r\nhalf the included angle_, b _the sine of half the base; and writing\r\nunity for the radius, we have_ Ssa² + d² - b² = 0; _in which_ a _or_ b\r\n_may be made the unknown quantity, as the case requires_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEMONSTRATION.\r\n\r\nLet PQR (_Fig._ 2.) be a spherical triangle, whose sides are PQ PR,\r\nthe angle included QPR, the base QR, PC the semiaxis of the sphere, in\r\nwhich the planes of the sides intersect.\r\n\r\nTo the pole P, draw the great circle AB, cutting the sides (produced,\r\nif needful) in M and N; and thro’ Q and R, the lesser circles Q_q_,\r\n_r_R, cutting off the arcs Q_r_ _q_R equal to the difference of the\r\nsides; join MN, Q_q_, _r_R, QR, _qr_.\r\n\r\nThen the planes of the circles described being parallel (_Theod.\r\nsphæric._ 2. 2.), and the axis PC perpendicular to them (_10. 1. of\r\nthe same_), their intersections with the planes of the sides, as QT,\r\nand R_t_, will make right angles with PC; that is, QT and R_t_ are the\r\nsines (S, _s_.) of the sides PQ PR, and MC NC are whole sines. Now the\r\nisosceles triangles MCN, QT_q_, _rt_R, being manifestly similar; as\r\nalso MN, the subtense of the arc which measures the angle QPR, being\r\nequal to (2_a_) twice the sine of half that angle; we shall have MN:\r\nMC∷ Q_q_: QT∷ _r_R: R_t_; or, in the notation of the theorem, Q_q_ =\r\n2S_a_, _r_R = 2_sa_. And further, the chords Q_r_ _q_R being equal, and\r\nequally distant from the center of the sphere, as also equally inclined\r\nto the axis PC, will, if produced, meet the axis produced, in one point\r\nZ. Whence the points Q, _q_, R, _r_, are in one plane (2. _el._ 11.),\r\nand in the circumference in which that plane cuts the surface of the\r\nsphere: the quadrilateral Q_q_R_r_ is also a segment of the isosceles\r\ntriangle ZQ_q_, cut off by a line parallel to its base, making the\r\ndiagonals QR, _qr_, equal. And therefore, by a known property of the\r\ncircle, Q_q_ × _r_R + (_q_R)² = (QR)²; which, substituting for Q_q_ and\r\nR_r_ the values found above, 2_d_ for Q_r_, 2_b_ for QR, and taking the\r\nfourth part of the whole, becomes S_sa_² + _d_² = _b_² the proposition\r\nthat was to be demonstrated.\r\n\r\n  _Note_ 1. If this, or the preceding, is applied to a plane triangle,\r\n  the sines of the sides become the sides themselves; the triangle\r\n  being conceived to lie in the surface of a sphere greater than any\r\n  that can be assigned.\r\n\r\n   _Note_ 2. If the two sides are equal, _d_ vanishing, the operation\r\n  is shorter: as it likewise is when one or both sides are quadrants.\r\n\r\n  _Note_ 3. By comparing this proposition with that of the Lord\r\n  Neper[26], which makes the 39th of Keill’s Trigonometry, it appears,\r\n  that if AC, AM, are two arcs, then sin. (AC + AM) ⁄ 2 × sin. (AC -\r\n  AM) ⁄ 2 = ((_b_ + _d_) × (_b_ - _d_) =) (sin. ½ AC + sin. ½ AM) ×\r\n  (sin. ½ AC - sin. ½ AM). And in the solution of Case II. the first of\r\n  these products will be the most readily computed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE IV.\r\n\r\n_When the part required stands opposite to a part, which is likewise\r\nunknown_: Having from the _data_ of Case I. found a fourth part, let\r\nthe sines of the given sides be S, _s_; those of the given angles Σ,\r\nσ; and the sines of half the unknown parts _a_ and _b_; and we shall\r\nhave, as before, S_sa_² + _d_² - _b_² = 0; and if the equation of the\r\nsupplements be (Σσα² + δ²) - β² = 0; then, because α² = 1 - _b_² = 1 -\r\n(S_sa_² + _d_²), and β² = 1 - _a_², substituting these values in the\r\nsecond equation, we get\r\n\r\nTHEOREM III.\r\n\r\n(1 - Σσ × (1 - _d_²) - δ²) ⁄ (1 - S_s_Σσ) = _a_²; in words thus:\r\n\r\n_Multiply the product of the sines of the two known angles by the\r\nsquare of the cosine of half the difference of the sides: add the\r\nsquare of the sine of half the difference of the angles; and divide the\r\ncomplement of this sum to unity, by the like complement of the product\r\nof the four sines of the sides and angles; and the square root of the\r\nquotient shall be the sine of half the unknown angle._\r\n\r\nIf we work by logarithms, the operation will not be very\r\ntroublesome; but the rule needs not be used, unless when a table\r\nof the trigonometrical analogies is wanting. To supply which, the\r\nforegoing theorems will be found sufficient, and of ready use; being\r\neither committed to memory, or noted down on the blank leaf of the\r\ntrigonometrical tables.\r\n\r\n  _Note_, The schemes may be better, raised in card-paper, or with bent\r\n  wires and threads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXI. _An Account of Two extraordinary Cases of Gall-Stones._ By James\r\nJohnstone, _M.

Dr._ Lyttelton, _Dean of_ Exeter.\r\n[Read Feb. 9, 1758.]\r\n\r\nRev. Sir,\r\n\r\nACcording to promise I send you a short account of the two\r\nextraordinary cases we talked of, the last time I had the pleasure of\r\nseeing you at Kidderminster.\r\n\r\nThe truth of the first narrated case you are already a sufficient judge\r\nof; and if it is at all necessary to ascertain the second in like\r\nmanner, I can at any time produce the poor woman and her husband before\r\nyou, who will attest the truth of sufferings, which will not easily\r\nescape their memory.\r\n\r\nYou are at liberty to dispose of this paper as you shall think proper.\r\nI am,\r\n\r\n                             Reverend Sir,\r\n               Your respectful and most humble Servant,\r\n                             J. Johnstone.\r\n\r\nKidderminster, Sept. 11. 1757.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHO’ it is now pretty well known, that colicky and icteric diseases\r\noften arise from gall-stones generated in the bilious receptacle, and\r\nobstructing its canals; yet an example of one, of such enormous size,\r\nvoided into the _duodenum_ from the _ductus communis_, as happened in\r\nthe first of the following cases, is a very rare, if not intirely an\r\nunexampled occurrence. It will encourage us not too easily to despair\r\nof the expulsion of the largest _calculi_ from the gall-bladder; and\r\nwill teach us, that all violent attacks of pain about the stomach\r\nare not owing to gout reflected upon that organ: it will make us\r\nmore cautious of giving drastic cathartics, heating and inflaming\r\nmedicines, upon such a vague presumption; and ought to dispose those,\r\nwho are trusted with the lives of their fellow-creatures, to a nicer\r\nobservation of even the minutest symptoms and circumstances, which may\r\noccur in diseases.\r\n\r\nThe second case points out, under certain circumstances, the\r\npractibility of extracting, by incision into the gall-bladder itself,\r\nthose _calculi_, which, from their figure, or other impediments, cannot\r\nbe voided in the natural way. The method of performing this unusual\r\noperation, and some instances of its success, have already been made\r\npublic in the Memoires de l’Acad. de Chirurg.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Mrs. F----, a sedentary corpulent old lady, had been much subject\r\nto colicky complaints, without jaundice, in the vigour of life. The\r\nseat of the pain was chiefly under the right _hypochondrium_, as high\r\nas the stomach. She had been tolerably free from it for at least eight\r\nyears past. December 5, 1753, about eleven o’clock in the evening, she\r\nwas suddenly seized with a violent pain, extending from that part of\r\nthe stomach lying under the right side, thro’ to her back. She compared\r\nit to a sword driven in that direction. This pain continued not only\r\nwith unremitted violence, but even increased, till seven o’clock in the\r\nmorning: all this time she vomited and strained almost incessantly;\r\nbut after her stomach was emptied of its contents, nothing came up\r\nbesides clear slime, streaked with blood. About seven o’clock in the\r\nmorning she felt her pain fall or move lower, as she expressed it,\r\nand from that time became remarkably easier. Soon after this change,\r\nshe became extremely sick, and vomited up, for the first time, a\r\nprodigious quantity of greenish yellow bile. She had not before this\r\nseizure been remarkably costive; and in her pain had a free motion\r\nto stool with effect; but during the remainder of the (6th) day had\r\nnone, tho’ all this time emollient clysters were injected; and she\r\ntook regularly every two hours a powder of _magnes. alb. terr. fol.\r\ntartar. tart. vitriol. ana_ ℈j. _ol. nuc. mosch. gutt._ j. with a\r\ndraught of the _succ. limon. & sal. absinth_. But in the middle of the\r\nnight, and all day (the 7th), she had an abundant discharge of loose\r\nbilious stools. She had continued free from excessive pain since the\r\nmorning of the former day, only now and then complained of uneasiness\r\nsometimes in one, sometimes in another, part of her bowels. About\r\ntwenty-four hours after her first seizure, she felt a great pain\r\nstriking towards the bottom of her back, and one hour after voided\r\nthe extraordinary _calculus_, of which the figure and description are\r\nsubjoined. Some time after pieces of skins were voided by stool, which\r\nwere evidently of the texture and appearance of the internal villous\r\ncoat of the intestines and gall-bladder. The above medicines were the\r\nonly ones she used, by my direction, under her painful complaint,\r\nexcepting an external fomentation, and bleeding, which the hardness and\r\ncontractedness of her pulse seemed to require. She was ordered to drink\r\nplentifully of thin broths, and other soft diluent liquors. During the\r\ncourse of her disorder she had no appearance of jaundice, nor since;\r\nand, considering her years, enjoys at present (Sept. 1757) very good\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nThis _calculus_, as appears by the figure, was of a pyriform shape,\r\nresembling the form of the _cystis fellea_ itself. Its surface was\r\nquite smooth and polished, excepting towards the base, at that part\r\nmarked A, where it was scabrous, as if some other substance had lain\r\ncontiguous to it. When broken through, it was composed of concentrical\r\nlaminæ, which were alternately white and ochre-coloured. In length it\r\nmeasured one inch and three tenths; its transverse section measured at\r\nleast seven tenths of an inch. It had a saponaceous smoothness, like\r\nother gall-stones, and floated upon water. It weighed only about 126\r\ngrains.\r\n\r\nTho’ it be difficult to conceive, how so bulky a substance, generated\r\nin the gall-bladder, could be conveyed along so narrow a passage as\r\nthe common biliary duct, especially considering the obliquity of its\r\ninsertion for near half an inch of length betwixt the coats of the\r\n_duodenum_; yet there seem sufficient _data_ in the above case to\r\nprove, that this animal stone was not formed in the alimentary tube,\r\nbut (large as it was) had come into it from the _ductus communis\r\ncholedochus_.\r\n\r\nThe shape and saponaceous smoothness, and colour of the laminæ, of this\r\nsubstance, shew it was moulded in the gall-bladder, and formed from\r\nbilious particles. The severe pain and torture, and enormous vomiting,\r\nshe underwent, for seven hours after her first seizure, argue, that it\r\nmust then be lodged in some canal much narrower and straighter than the\r\nalimentary canal; for so soon as it dropped into that, the severe pain\r\nin a great measure ceased.\r\n\r\nBut that straight canal, in which it was situated during those\r\nseven hours of torture, could be no other than the _ductus communis\r\ncholedochus_; for, during this space of time, no bile was emptied\r\ninto the bowels, nor thrown up by the strongest efforts of vomiting.\r\nBut no sooner had she perceived the cause of her pain to move or drop\r\ndownwards (a sensation, which points out the precise moment the stone\r\nmust have dropped into the _duodenum_), than she began to sicken,\r\nand instantly after vomited up a vast quantity of bilious matter;\r\nwhich now, from the de-obstructed duct, began to flow freely into\r\nthe _duodenum_. The obstruction of the _ductus choledochus_ was of\r\ntoo short a duration (only three hours) to occasion any observable\r\njaundice. And it appears by the bloody flesh-like knots, thrown up\r\nwith phlegm by vomiting, that the passage of the substance was not\r\neffected without considerable laceration of the small bilious ducts.\r\nAnd this easily accounts for the separation of the villous coat, which\r\nafterwards appeared in this patient’s stools.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This coarse delineation represents the figure and true\r\nbulk of the _calculus_; which, I believe, is still in my patient’s\r\ncustody.]\r\n\r\n2. In February 1752. I was called to relieve a poor woman of this\r\nplace, Sarah Ewdall, aged 30 years and upwards, and the mother of\r\nseveral children. She laboured under the jaundice, and complained of\r\na severe acute pain striking thro’ from the right _hypochondrium_\r\nto her back, with frequent vomitings. A præternatural hardness, of\r\na compass not exceeding the hollow of the hand, was then plainly to\r\nbe felt at the pit of the stomach, or a little nearer to the right\r\n_hypochondrium_. When that particular part was pressed, she complained\r\nof great pain. The pain at this part was always increased by attempting\r\nto lie upon the left side. She was blooded, fomented externally,\r\nhad emollient saponaceous clysters injected, and a nitrous apozem,\r\nand pills composed of _galban. & sap. Castillens._ and soon after\r\nrecovered. She had frequent returns of the same complaint after this;\r\nbut I saw her not again till Jan. 1755, when she lay insensible in a\r\nfit, which for several days deprived her of the use of her speech and\r\nof all her senses, only she tossed her limbs about. About a quarter of\r\na year after she had recovered from this fit, Mr. Cooper of this place,\r\nher apothecary, informed me, that from a small sore at the pit of her\r\nstomach, which came since her last illness, she had voided several\r\ngall-stones. Curiosity prompted me to inquire into the matter of fact\r\nfrom herself. She shewed me the sore, which was now almost cicatrized.\r\nShe said, that soon after her last illness a little pimple arose upon\r\nthat part of the pit of the stomach, which had been hard ever since she\r\nhad been subject to the jaundice. This pimple broke, ran matter, and at\r\ndifferent times the _calculi_, which she shewed me, had come out with\r\nthe matter. Her stomach had been somewhat painful before it broke, but\r\nwas now easy. The _calculi_, which she shewed me, had the appearance\r\nof being fragments of larger ones, and some were almost dust; tho’ she\r\nassured me they all came from the sore in that condition. Of these\r\nfragments I have two or three of the largest now in my custody: they\r\nare light, swim on water, smooth like soap; are of a yellow colour, and\r\nin some parts brown like snuff; and consist of similar concentrical\r\nlayers. The poor woman has since then been troubled with returns of\r\npain and jaundice, in the intervals of which her skin is perfectly\r\nclear and white. She is still alive, and ready to attest the truth of\r\nthis narrative.\r\n\r\n                                                          J. Johnstone.\r\n\r\nKidderminster, Sept. 11th, 1757.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXII. _A remarkable Case of Cohesions of all the Intestines_, &c.\r\n_in a Man of about Thirty-four Years of Age, who died some time last\r\nSummer, and afterwards fell under the Inspection of Mr._ Nicholas Jenty.\r\n\r\n[Read Feb. 9, 1758.]\r\n\r\nTHE subject was tall, and partly emaciated. I found nothing externally\r\nbut a wound in the left side, which seemed to me to have been\r\ndegenerated into an ulcer. As I did not know the man when he was alive,\r\nand had him two days after his decease, I cannot give an immediate\r\naccount of the cause of his death. But in opening his abdomen, I found\r\nthe epiploon adhering close to the intestines, in such a manner, that I\r\ncould not part it without tearing it. It felt rough and dry. And as I\r\nwas going to remove the intestines, to examine the mesentery, I found\r\nthem so coherent one with the other, that it was impossible for me to\r\ndivide them without laceration. Then I inflated the intestinal tube,\r\nfor the inspection of this extraordinary phænomenon; but, to my great\r\nsurprize, all the external parts of the intestines appeared smooth;\r\nvery few of the circumvolutions were seen, occasioned by the strong\r\nlateral cohesions of their sides with each other. The substance of the\r\nintestines was rough, and a great many pimples, as big as the head of\r\na pin, appeared in them, and were almost free from any moisture. It is\r\nproper to observe, that these pimples have been taken for glands by the\r\nlate Dr. James Douglas, and others; whereas they are in reality nothing\r\nelse but the orifices of the exhaling vessels obstructed, and are not\r\nto be met with except in morbid cases.\r\n\r\nAfter having made incisions in that part of the _colon_ next to\r\nthe _rectum_, I found the _peritonæum_, or external membrane which\r\ninvests the intestines, and the _viscera_ of the _abdomen_, to be of\r\nthe thickness of a six-pence; and I fairly drew all the intestines\r\nfrom their external membrane without separating their cohesions;\r\nthe _peritonæum_, or external membrane, afterwards appearing like\r\nanother set of intestines. I found a fluid in the intestines; and I\r\nwill not take upon me to say, how the peristaltic motion must have\r\nbeen performed. And afterwards I parted the stomach from its external\r\ntunic, as I had done the intestines. I found no obstruction in the\r\nmesenteric glands; but every evolution of the mesentery firmly cohered\r\ntogether. The liver also adhered closely to the diaphragm, and its\r\nadjacent parts: and in the _vesicula fellis_ I found the bile pretty\r\nthick, neither too green nor too yellow, but a tint between both. I\r\nmet with nothing remarkable in the other parts of the _abdomen_. In\r\nopening the _thorax_, I found the lungs closely adhering to the ribs\r\nlaterally, and posteriorly and interiorly close to the _pericardium_.\r\nIn making an incision to open the _pericardium_, I found it so closely\r\nadhering to the heart, that I could not avoid wounding that organ, and\r\nwith much difficulty could part it from it. I met with no fluid in the\r\n_pericardium_. The heart was small; and in the internal side the pores\r\nof the _pericardium_ appeared so large, that one might have insinuated\r\nthe head of a middling pin into them. They have been described by some\r\nanatomists, who have met with cases somewhat similar to this, but\r\nwithout such universal adhesions; and they have been supposed to have\r\nbeen glands. The same pores likewise appeared on the heart; which, in\r\nmy opinion, are nothing but the extremities of the exhaling vessels. In\r\nremoving the heart, I found the _dorsal_, and other lymphatic glands\r\nabove the lungs, quite large, indurated, and of a dark greyish colour.\r\nNothing remarkable appeared in the lungs; only, that the portion of\r\nthe _pleura_, which invests the lungs, and is generally thin, was here\r\nthick and rough; and thro’ a glass it appeared as if covered with\r\ngrains of sand; and might in several places have been easily torn from\r\nthe lungs.\r\n\r\nThe _aorta_ was pretty large; and in that part of it, which runs on the\r\ntenth _dorsal vertebra_, I found a _cystis_, as big as an olive, full\r\nof _pus_; and lower down, immediately before that vessel perforates the\r\ndiaphragm, I found another, something less, full of matter likewise;\r\nboth which portions I have by me. That portion of the _aorta_, where\r\nthe _cystis_ appeared, was rather thicker than the other, and osseous.\r\nIn opening the _cranium_, I found in that part of the _cerebrum_, which\r\nlies over the _cerebellum_, a table spoonfull of _pus_, of a greenish\r\ncolour; and examining it thro’ a glass, there was an appearance of\r\n_animalcula_ in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXIII. _Of the best Form of Geographical Maps. By the Rev._ Patrick\r\nMurdoch, _M. A. F.R.S._\r\n\r\n[Read Feb. 9, 1758.]\r\n\r\nI. WHEN any portion of the earth’s surface is projected on a plane,\r\nor transferred to it by whatever method of description, the real\r\ndimensions, and very often the figure and position of countries, are\r\nmuch altered and misrepresented. In the common projection of the\r\ntwo hemispheres, the meridians and parallels of latitude do indeed\r\nintersect at right angles, as on the globe; but the linear distances\r\nare every-where diminished, excepting only at the extremity of the\r\nprojection: at the center they are but half their just quantity, and\r\nthence the superficial dimensions but one-fourth part: and in less\r\ngeneral maps this inconvenience will always, in some degree, attend the\r\n_stereographic_ projection.\r\n\r\nThe _orthographic_, by parallel lines, would be still less exact,\r\nthose lines falling altogether oblique on the extreme parts of the\r\nhemisphere. It is useful, however, in describing the circum-polar\r\nregions: and the rules of both projections, for their elegance, as well\r\nas for their uses in astronomy, ought to be retained, and carefully\r\nstudied. As to Wright’s, or Mercator’s, nautical chart, it does not\r\nhere fall under our consideration: it is perfect in its kind; and will\r\nalways be reckoned among the chief inventions of the last age. If it\r\nhas been misunderstood, or misapplied, by geographers, they only are to\r\nblame.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The particular methods of description proposed or used by\r\ngeographers are so various, that we might, on that very account,\r\nsuspect them to be faulty; but in most of their works we actually\r\nfind these two blemishes, _the linear distances visibly false_, and\r\n_the intersections of the circles oblique_: so that a quadrilateral\r\nrectangular space shall often be represented by an oblique-angled\r\nrhomboid figure, whose diagonals are very far from equal; and yet,\r\nby a strange contradiction, you shall see a fixed scale of distances\r\ninserted in such a map.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. The only maps I remember to have seen, in which the last of these\r\nblemishes is removed, and the other lessened, are some of P. Schenk’s\r\nof Amsterdam, a map of the Russian empire, the Germania Critica of the\r\nfamous Professor Meyer, and a few more[27]. In these the meridians are\r\nstraight lines converging to a point; from which, as a center, the\r\nparallels of latitude are described: and a rule has been published for\r\nthe drawing of such maps[28]. But as that rule appears to be only an\r\neasy and convenient approximation, it remains still to be inquired,\r\n_What is the construction of a particular map, that shall exhibit the\r\nsuperficial and linear measures in their truest proportions?_ In order\r\nto which,\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Let E_l_LP, in this figure (_See_ TAB. XXI.) be the quadrant of\r\na meridian of a given sphere, whose center is C, and its pole P; EL,\r\nE_l_, the latitudes of two places in that meridian, EM their middle\r\nlatitude. Draw LN, _ln_, cosines of the latitudes, the sine of the\r\nmiddle latitude MF, and its cotangent MT. Then writing unity for the\r\nradius, if in CM we take C_x_ = N_n_ ⁄ (L_l_ × MF × MT), and thro’ _x_\r\nwe draw _x_R, _xr_, equal each to half the arc L_l_, and perpendicular\r\nto CM; the conical surface generated by the line R_r_, while the figure\r\nrevolves on the axis of the sphere, will be equal to the surface of\r\nthe zone that is to be described in the same time by the arc L_l_; as\r\nwill easily appear by comparing that conical surface with the zone, as\r\nmeasured by _Archimedes_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Philos. Trans. Vol. L._ TAB. XXI. _p. 554_.\r\n\r\n_J. Mynde sc._]\r\n\r\nAnd, lastly, If from the point _t_, in which _r_R produced meets the\r\naxis, we take the angle C_t_V in proportion to the longitude of the\r\nproposed map, as MF the sine of the middle latitude is to radius, and\r\ndraw the parallels and meridians as in the figure, the whole space\r\nSOQV will be the proposed part of the conical surface expanded into a\r\nplane; in which the places may now be inserted according to their known\r\nlongitudes and latitudes.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE.\r\n\r\nV. Let L_l_, the breadth of the zone, be 50°, lying between 10° and 60°\r\nnorth latitude; its longitude 110°, from 20° east of the Canaries to\r\nthe center of the western hemisphere; comprehending the western parts\r\nof Europe and Africa, the more known parts of North America, and the\r\nocean that separates it from the old continent.\r\n\r\nAnd because C_x_ = N_n_ ⁄ (L_l_ × MF × MT), add these three logarithms.\r\n\r\n    Log. 0.8726650 (= 50° to radius 1)            -1.9408476\r\n    Log. MF (sin. 35°)                            -1.7585913\r\n    Log. MT (tang. 55°)                            0.1547732\r\n                                                  ----------\r\n  Take the sum                                    -1.8542121\r\n  from log. N_n_ (= .6923772)                     -1.8403427\r\n                                                  ----------\r\n  the remainder                                   -1.9861306\r\n  is the logarithm of C_x_. And because 1:\r\n  C_x_ ∷ MT : _xt_, to this adding the log. MT 0.1547732\r\n                                                  ----------\r\n    The sum                                        0.1409038\r\n\r\nis the log. of _xt_ = 1.383260; and _x_R (= _xr_ = ½ L_l_) being\r\n.4363325, R_t_ will be 0.9469275, _rt_ = 1.8195925. Whence having fixed\r\nupon any convenient size for our map, the center _t_ is easily found.\r\nAs, allowing an inch to a degree of a great circle, or 50 inches to the\r\nline R_r_, R_t_ the semidiameter of the least parallel will be 54.255\r\ninches, and that of the greatest parallel 104.255 inches.\r\n\r\nAgain, making as radius to MF so the longitude 110° to the angle S_t_V,\r\nthat angle will be 63° 5´ ⅗. Divide the meridians and parallels, and\r\nfinish the map as usual.\r\n\r\n  _Note_, The log. MT being repeated in this computation with a\r\n  contrary sign, we may find _xt_ immediately by subtracting the sum of\r\n  the logarithms of L_l_ and MF from the log. of N_n_.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. A map drawn by this rule will have the following properties:\r\n\r\n1. The intersections of the meridians and parallels will be\r\nrectangular.\r\n\r\n2. The distances north and south will be exact; and any meridian will\r\nserve as a scale.\r\n\r\n3. The parallels thro’ _z_ and _y_, where the line R_r_ cuts the arc\r\nL_l_, or any small distances of places that lie in those parallels,\r\nwill be of their just quantity. At the extreme latitudes they will\r\nexceed, and in mean latitudes, from _x_ towards _z_ or _y_, they will\r\nfall short of it. But unless the zone is very broad, neither the excess\r\nnor the defect will be any-where considerable.\r\n\r\n4. The latitudes and the superficies of the map being exact, by the\r\nconstruction, it follows, that the excesses and defects of distance,\r\nnow mentioned, compensate each other; and are, in general, of the least\r\nquantity they can have in the map designed.\r\n\r\n5. If a thread is extended on a plane, and fixed to it at its two\r\nextremities, and afterwards the plane is formed into a pyramidal or\r\nconical surface, it may be easily shewn, that the thread will pass\r\nthro’ the same points of the surface as before; and that, _conversely_,\r\nthe shortest distance between two points in a conical surface is\r\nthe right line which joins them, when that surface is expanded into\r\na plane. Now, in the present case, the shortest distances on the\r\nconical surface will be, if not equal, always nearly equal, to the\r\ncorrespondent distances on the sphere: and therefore, all rectilinear\r\ndistances on the map, applied to the meridian as a scale, will, nearly\r\nat least, shew the true distances of the places represented.\r\n\r\n6. In maps, whose breadth exceeds not 10° or 15°, the rectilinear\r\ndistances may be taken for sufficiently exact. But we have chosen our\r\nexample of a greater breadth than can often be required, on purpose\r\nto shew how high the errors can ever arise; and how they may, if it is\r\nthought needful, be nearly estimated and corrected.\r\n\r\n\r\nWrite down, in a vacant space at the bottom of the map, a table of the\r\nerrors of equidistant parallels, as from five degrees to five degrees\r\nof the whole latitude; and having taken the mean errors, and diminished\r\nthem in the ratio of radius to the sine of the mean inclination of\r\nthe line of distance to the meridian, you shall find the correction\r\nrequired; remembering only to distinguish the distance into its parts\r\nthat lie _within_ and _without_ the sphere, and taking the difference\r\nof the correspondent errors, in _defect_ and in _excess_.\r\n\r\nBut it was thought needless to add any examples; as, from what has been\r\nsaid, the intelligent reader will readily see the use of such a table;\r\nand chiefly as, whenever exactness is required, it will be more proper,\r\nand indeed more expeditious, to compute the distances of places by the\r\nfollowing canon.\r\n\r\n_Multiply the product of the cosines of the two given latitudes by\r\nthe square of the sine of half the difference of longitude; and to\r\nthis product add the square of the sine of half the difference of the\r\nlatitudes; the square root of the sum shall be the sine of half the arc\r\nof a great circle between the two places given._\r\n\r\nThus, if we are to find the true distance from one angle of our map to\r\nthe opposite, that is, from S to Q, the operation will be as follows:\r\n\r\n        L. sin. 30° = -1.6989700\r\n        L. sin. 80° = -1.9933515\r\n      2 L. sin. 55° = -1.8267290\r\n                      ----------\r\n                      -1.5190505 = log. of 0.330408\r\n  and 2 L. sin. 25° = -1.2518966 = log. of 0.178606\r\n                      ----------           --------\r\n                       Log. of the sum     0.509014 is -1.7067297\r\n                                         Whose half is -1.8533648\r\n  the L. sin. of 45° 31´, the double of which is 91° 2´, or 5462\r\n  geographical miles.\r\n\r\nAnd seeing the lines TS, TQ, reduced to minutes of a degree, are\r\n6255.189 and 3255.189 respectively, and the angle STV is 63° 5´⅗, the\r\nright line SQ on the map will be 5594´, exceeding its just value by\r\n132´ or ¹⁄₄₂ of the whole.\r\n\r\n7. The errors on the parallels increasing fast towards the north,\r\nand the line SQ having, at last, nearly the same direction, it is not\r\nto be wondered that the errors in our example should amount to ¹⁄₄₂.\r\nGreater still would happen, if we measured the distance from O to Q\r\nby a straight line joining those points: for that line, on the conic\r\nsurface, lying every-where at a greater distance from the sphere than\r\nthe points O and Q, must plainly be a very improper measure of the\r\ndistance of their correspondent points on the sphere. And therefore, to\r\nprevent all errors of that kind, and confine the other errors in this\r\npart of our map to narrower bounds, it will be best to terminate it\r\ntowards the pole by a straight line KI touching the parallel OQ in the\r\nmiddle point K, and on the east and west by lines, as HI, parallel to\r\nthe meridian thro’ K, and meeting the tangent at the middle point of\r\nthe parallel SV in H. By this means too we shall gain more space than\r\nwe lose, while the map takes the usual rectangular form, and the spaces\r\nGHV remain for the _title_, and other inscriptions.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. Another, and not the least considerable, property of our map\r\nis, that it may, without sensible error, be used as a sea-chart; the\r\nrumb-lines on it being logarithmic spirals to their common pole _t_,\r\nas is partly represented in the figure: and the arithmetical solutions\r\nthence derived will be found as accurate as is necessary in the art of\r\nsailing.\r\n\r\nThus if it were required to find the course a ship is to steer between\r\ntwo ports, whose longitudes and latitudes are known, we may use the\r\nfollowing\r\n\r\nRULE.\r\n\r\n_To the logarithm of the number of minutes in the difference of\r\nlongitude add the constant logarithm[29] -4.1015105, and to their sum\r\nthe logarithm sine of the mean latitude, and let this last sum be_ S.\r\n\r\n_The cotangent of the mean latitude being_ T, _and an arithmetical mean\r\nbetween half the difference of latitude and its tangent being called_\r\nm, _from the logarithm of_ T + m _take the logarithm of_ T - m, _and\r\nlet the logarithm of their difference be_ D; _then shall_ S - D _be\r\nnearly the logarithm tangent of the angle, in which the ship’s course\r\ncuts the meridians_.\r\n\r\n  _Note_, We ought, in strictness, to use the ratio of _tx_ + _x_R to\r\n  _tx_ - _x_R instead of T + _m_ to T - _m_; but we substitute this\r\n  last as more easily computed, and very little different.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE 1.\r\n\r\nLet the latitudes, on the same side of the equator, be 10° and 60°;\r\nthen the middle latitude and its complement are 35° and 55°, and half\r\nthe difference of the latitudes is 25°: and the difference of longitude\r\nbeing 110°, the operation will stand as below.\r\n\r\n  Log. 6600´ (in 110°)   3.8195439\r\n  Constant log.         -4.1015105\r\n                        ----------\r\n                        -1.9210544\r\n  Log. sin. 35°         -1.7585913\r\n                        ----------\r\n                            S = ... -1.6796457\r\n        Again T = 1.4281480\r\n            _m_ =  .4513202\r\n                  ---------\r\n  Log.

D. and Secret. R. S. By Mr._ Wm. Mountaine,\r\n_F.R.S._\r\n\r\n[Read April 6, 1758.]\r\n\r\n                                               London, March 21. 1758.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nAMONG the several improvements made in arts and sciences by ingenious\r\nmen, the construction of _globes_, _maps_, or _charts_, deserves a\r\nplace: not only on account of the pleasure and satisfaction that\r\narises to speculative minds, in surveying the extent and divisions of\r\nthis terraqueous globe, but also for their real use and service to\r\nnavigation, trade, and commerce.\r\n\r\n_Globes_ perhaps were first invented, as bearing the nearest semblance\r\nto the natural form of the earth and sea, with proper circles thereon\r\ndescribed, and the several empires and kingdoms, according to their\r\nextent, latitudes, and longitudes, as far as geography and history\r\nwould admit.\r\n\r\nBut tho’ these convey the most general and truest ideas of the position\r\nand situation of places; yet, as containing but a small surface, they\r\nwere found not extensive enough to take in particular kingdoms or\r\nstates, with their subdivisions, cities, and rivers, so as to convey\r\nan adequate and sufficient representation. Besides, they were not so\r\nportable and commodious in voyages or travels.\r\n\r\n_Maps_ and _Charts_ were therefore thought of, as being most convenient\r\nfor both the purposes above-mentioned; the accuracy of which depends\r\non representing the meridians and parallels in such manner, that when\r\nplaces are laid thereon, according to their latitudes and longitudes,\r\nthey may have such respect to each other, as they have on the globe\r\nitself; and those are either _globular_ or _rectilinear_.\r\n\r\n_Globular_, or _curvilinear_, are either general or particular.\r\n\r\n_General_, are the hemispheres; for the most part constructed\r\nstereographically.\r\n\r\n_Particular_, contain only some part of the terraqueous globe; and of\r\nthis sort there are sundry modes of construction, which for the most\r\npart are defective, so as not to be applied with accuracy and facility\r\nto the purposes intended, in determining the courses or bearings of\r\nplaces, their distances, or both.\r\n\r\n_Rectilinear_ were therefore very early adopted, on which the meridians\r\nwere described parallel to each other, and the degrees of latitude and\r\nlongitude every-where equal; the rumbs were consequently right lines;\r\nand hereby it was thought, that the courses or bearings of places would\r\nbe more easily determined.\r\n\r\nBut these were found also insufficient and erroneous, the meridians\r\nbeing parallel, which ought to converge; and no method or device used\r\nto accommodate that parallelism.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the great deficiency in this plane map or chart, it was\r\npreferred, especially in nautical business; and hath its uses at this\r\nday in topographic constructions, as in bays, harbours, and very narrow\r\nzones.\r\n\r\nHowever, the errors herein were sooner discovered than corrected, both\r\nby mathematicians and mariners, as by Martin Cortese, Petrus Nonius,\r\nCoigniet, and some say by Ptolemy himself.\r\n\r\nThe first step towards the improvement of this chart was made by\r\nGerardus Mercator, who published a map about the year 1550, wherein the\r\ndegrees of latitude were increased from the equator towards each pole;\r\nbut upon what principles this was constructed, he did not exhibit.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1590, Mr. Edward Wright, an Englishman, discovered\r\nthe true principles upon which such a chart should be constructed;\r\nand communicated the same to one Jodocus Hondius, an engraver, who,\r\ncontrary to his honest faith and engagement, published the same as\r\nhis own invention: This occasioned Mr. Wright, in the year 1599, to\r\nexhibit his method of construction, in his book, intitled, _Correction\r\nof Errors in Navigation_; in the preface of which book may be seen\r\nhis charge and proof against Hondius; and also how far Mercator has\r\nany right to share in the honour due for this great improvement in\r\ngeography and navigation.\r\n\r\nBlundevill, in his Exercises, page 327, published anno 1594, gives a\r\ntable of meridional parts answering to even degrees, from 1° to 80°\r\nof latitude, with the sketch of a chart constructed therefrom; but\r\nthis table he acknowledged to have received from Mr. Wright, in the\r\nfollowing words, page 326, _viz._ “In the mean time to reform the saide\r\nfaults,” (in the plane chart) “Mercator hath in his universal chard or\r\nmappe made the spaces of the parallels of latitude to bee wider everie\r\none than other from the equinoctial towards either of the poles, by\r\nwhat rule I know not, unless it be by such a table as my friend Maister\r\nWright of Caius-college in Cambridge at my request sent me (I thank\r\nhim) not long since for that purpose, which table with his consent, I\r\nhave plainlie set down,” _&c._\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1720, a globular chart was published, said to be\r\nconstructed by Mr. Henry Wilson; the errors in which were obviated\r\nby Mr. Thomas Haselden, in a letter to Dr. Halley; who at the same\r\ntime exhibited a new scale, whereby distances on a given course may\r\nbe measured, or laid off, at one extent of the compasses, on Wright’s\r\nprojection; and was intended to render the same as easy in practice as\r\nthe plane chart.\r\n\r\nThe above chart was published in opposition to Mr. Wright’s, which that\r\nauthor charged with imperfections and errors, and that it represented\r\nplaces bigger than they are upon the globe.\r\n\r\nIt is true, the surface is apparently enlarged; but the position of\r\nplaces, in respect to one another, are in no wise distorted; and it may\r\nbe asserted, with the same parity of reason, that the lines of sines,\r\ntangents, and secants, are false, because the degrees of the circle,\r\nwhich are equal among themselves, are thereupon represented unequal.\r\n\r\nYet if a map or chart was so constructed, as to shew the situation and\r\ntrue extent of countries, _&c. primâ facie_ (if I may be allowed the\r\nexpression), and yet retain all the properties, uses, and simplicity,\r\nof Wright’s construction, it would be a truly great improvement; but\r\nthis seems to be impossible.\r\n\r\nThe method exhibited by the Rev. Mr. Murdoch, in his paper, read before\r\nthe Royal Society on the 9th of February last, shews the situation of\r\nplaces, and seems better calculated for determining superficial and\r\nlinear measures, than any other that has occurred to me.\r\n\r\nThis Gentleman illustrates his theory with examples justly intended to\r\npoint out the quantity of error, that will happen in a large extent.\r\n\r\nFor instance; Between latitudes 10° and 60° N. and containing 110\r\ndegrees difference of longitude, Mr. Murdoch computes the distance at\r\n5594 miles; which, upon the arc of a great circle, is found to be 5477,\r\nor by other methods 5462; so that the difference is only 117, or at\r\nmost 132 miles in so great an extent, and to an high latitude; and the\r\nhigher the latitude the greater the error is like to be, where-ever\r\nmiddle latitude is concerned.\r\n\r\nHis courses also agree very nearly with computations made from the\r\ntables of meridional parts.\r\n\r\nIn example the first they are the very same:\r\n\r\nIn example the 2d they agree to half a minute:\r\n\r\nIn example the 3d they vary 1° 4´, on account of the high latitudes,\r\nwhich extend from 56° to 80° N.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do not esteem this method so simple, easy, and concise, in\r\nthe practice of navigation, as Mr. Wright’s construction, especially in\r\ndetermining the bearings or courses from place to place: nor will it (I\r\npresume) admit of a zone containing both north and south latitude.\r\n\r\nOf these inconveniences Mr. Murdoch seems to be extremely well\r\nacquainted, when he expresses himself in the following very candid and\r\ningenuous terms, _viz._ “As to Wright’s or Mercator’s nautical chart,\r\nit does not here fall under our consideration: it is perfect in its\r\nkind; and will always be reckoned among the chief inventions of the\r\nlast age. If it has been misunderstood or misapplied by geographers,\r\nthey only are to blame.”--And again, at the end of his nautical\r\nexamples, he concludes thus, _viz._ “It is not meant, however, that it\r\nought to take place of the easier and better computation by a table of\r\nmeridional parts.”\r\n\r\nI have the honour to be, with the greatest respect,\r\n\r\n                                 SIR,\r\n                       The ROYAL SOCIETY’S, and\r\n                     _Your_ most obedient Servant,\r\n                          William Mountaine.\r\n\r\n\r\nADDENDA _to Mr._ Murdoch_’s Paper_, Nº. LXXIII.\r\n\r\n  IF it is required “to draw a map, in which the superficies of a given\r\n  zone shall be equal to the zone on the sphere, while at the same time\r\n  the projection from the center is strictly geometrical;” _Take_ Cx\r\n  _to_ CM _as a geometrical mean between_ CM _and_ Nn, _is to the like\r\n  mean between the cosine of the middle latitude, and twice the tangent\r\n  of the semidifference of latitudes_; and project on the conic surface\r\n  generated by _xt_. But here the degrees of latitude towards the\r\n  middle will fall short of their just quantity, and at the extremities\r\n  exceed it: which hurts the eye. Artists may use either rule: or, in\r\n  most cases, they need only make C_x_ to CM as the arc ML is to its\r\n  tangent, and finish the map; either by a projection, or, as in the\r\n  first method, by dividing that part of _xt_ which is intercepted by\r\n  the secants thro’ L and _l_, into equal degrees of latitude.\r\n\r\n   Mr. Mountaine justly observes, “that my rule does not admit of a\r\n  zone containing N. and S. latitudes.” But the remedy is, _to extend\r\n  the lesser latitudes to an equality with the greater; that the cone\r\n  may be changed into a cylinder, and the rumbs into straight lines_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXV. _Cases of the remarkable Effects of Blisters in lessening the\r\nQuickness of the Pulse in Coughs, attended with Infarction of the\r\nLungs and Fever: By_ Robert Whytt, _M. D. F.R.S. Fellow of the Royal\r\nCollege of Physicians, and Professor of Medicine in the University of_\r\nEdinburgh.\r\n\r\n[Read Feb. 16, 1758.]\r\n\r\nONE of the most natural effects of blistering plaisters, when applied\r\nto the human body, is to quicken the pulse, and increase the force\r\nof the circulation. This effect they produce, not only by means of\r\nthe pain and inflammation they raise in the parts to which they are\r\napplied, but also because the finer particles of the _cantharides_,\r\nwhich enter the blood, render it more apt to stimulate the heart and\r\nvascular system.\r\n\r\nThe apprehension, that blisters must in every case accelerate the\r\nmotion of the blood, seems to have been the reason, why some eminent\r\nphysicians have been unwilling to use them in feverish and inflammatory\r\ndisorders, till after the force of the disease was a good deal abated,\r\nand the pulse beginning to sink. However, an attentive observation\r\nof the effects, which follow the application of blisters in those\r\ndiseases, will shew, that instead of increasing, they often remarkably\r\nlessen the frequency of the pulse. This I had occasion formerly to take\r\nnotice of[31], and shall now evince more fully by the following cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. A widow lady, aged about 50, was seized (December 1755) with a bad\r\ncough, oppression about her stomach and breast, and a pain in her\r\nright side, tho’ not very acute. Her pulse being quick, and skin hot,\r\nsome blood was taken away, which was a good deal sizy: attenuating and\r\nexpectorating medicines were also prescribed. But as her complaints\r\ndid not yield to these remedies, I was called on December 26th, after\r\nshe had been ill about ten days; at which time her pulse beat from 96\r\nto 100 times in a minute, but was not fuller than natural. I ordered\r\nher to lose seven or eight ounces more of blood, which, like the\r\nformer, was sizy; and next day, finding no abatement of her complaints,\r\nI advised a blister to be applied, in the evening, to that part of\r\nher right side which was pained. Next morning, when the blister was\r\nremoved, the pain of her side was gone, and her pulse beat only 88\r\ntimes in a minute, and in two days more it came down to 78. However,\r\nafter the blistered part became dry, the pulse rose in one day’s time\r\nto 96, and continued between that number and 90 for four days; after\r\nwhich I ordered a large blister to be put between her shoulders. When\r\nthis plaister was taken off, her pulse beat under 90 times in a minute;\r\nand next day it fell to 76, and the day after to 72. The cough and\r\nother symptoms, which were relieved by the first blister, were quite\r\ncured by the second.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. John Graham, bookbinder, in Edinburgh, aged 37, of a thin habit\r\nof body, formerly subject to coughs, and thought to be in danger of\r\na _phthisis pulmonalis_, having exposed himself unwarily to cold\r\nin the night time, was, about the end of January 1756, seized with\r\na bad cough and feverishness; for which he was blooded, and had a\r\ndiaphoretic julep, a pectoral decoction, and a mixture with _gum.\r\nammoniacum_ and _acetum scilliticum_, given him by Mr. James Russell,\r\nsurgeon-apothecary in this place. On the 12th of February, after he\r\nhad been ill above a fortnight, I was desired to visit him. He seemed\r\nto be a good deal emaciated; his eyes were hollow, and cheeks fallen\r\nin: he was almost constantly in a sweat; coughed frequently, and spit\r\nup a great quantity of tough phlegm, somewhat resembling _pus_: his\r\npulse beat from 112 to 116 times in a minute. In this condition I\r\nordered immediately a blister to be applied between his shoulders,\r\nwhich lessened in some degree his cough and spitting, as well as the\r\nfrequency of his pulse; but the blistered part no sooner began to\r\nheal, than he became as ill as before, and continued in this bad way\r\nnine or ten days, gradually wasting, with continued sweats, and a\r\ngreat spitting of a thick _mucus_. During this time he used _tinctura\r\nrosarum_, and the mixture with _gum. ammon._ and _acet. scillit._\r\nwithout any sensible benefit, and had six ounces of blood taken away,\r\nwhich was very watery, and the _crassamentum_ was of a lax texture.\r\nIn this almost desperate condition, another blister, larger than the\r\nformer, was put between his shoulders, which remarkably lessened his\r\ncough and spitting, and in two or three days reduced his pulse to\r\n96 strokes in a minute. After this he continued to recover slowly,\r\nwithout the assistance of any other medicine, except the _tinctura\r\nrosarum_ and the mixture with _gum. ammon._ and _acet. scillit._ and at\r\npresent he enjoys good health.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Mrs.----, aged upwards of 40, who had for several years been\r\nsubject to a cough and spitting in the winter months, was, in October\r\n1756, seized with those complaints in a much greater degree than\r\nusual; to remove which, she was blooded, and got some attenuating and\r\npectoral medicines from Mr. John Balfour, surgeon-apothecary in Leith.\r\nI was called on November 11th, after she had been ill several weeks,\r\nand found her in a very unpromising condition. She had a frequent\r\nand severe cough, with great shortness of breath and a wheezing; her\r\nlungs seemed to be quite stuffed with phlegm, of which she spit a vast\r\nquantity every day, and of such an appearance, that I was apprehensive\r\nit was, in part at least, truly purulent. When she sat up in a chair,\r\nher pulse beat above 130 times in a minute. She had a considerable\r\nthirst, and her tongue was of a deep red colour, with a beginning\r\naphthous crust on some parts of it. She was so weak, and her pulse so\r\nfeeble, that there was no place for further bleeding: a blister was\r\ntherefore applied to her back, November 11th, which somewhat lowered\r\nher pulse, and lessened the shortness of breathing and quantity of\r\nphlegm in her lungs. November 16th, a second blister was laid to her\r\nside, which gave her still more sensible relief than the former, and\r\nreduced her pulse to 114 strokes in a minute. November 25th, a third\r\nblister was applied to her back; by which her cough and wheezing were\r\nrendered considerably easier, and the phlegm, which she spit up, lost\r\nits purulent appearance, became thinner, more frothy, and was much\r\nless in quantity. Her pulse beat now only 104 times in a minute. After\r\nthis, her cough and spitting increasing again, she had, on the 20th of\r\nDecember, a fourth blister applied to her back, which, like the former,\r\ndid her great service. Her stomach being extremely delicate, I scarce\r\nordered any medicines for her all this time, except a cordial julep,\r\nwith _spir. volat. oleos._ tincture of rhubarb as a laxative, and a\r\njulep of _aqu. rosar. acet. vin. alb._ and _syr. balsam._ of which last\r\nshe took two table spoonfuls twice or thrice a day in a quarter of a\r\npint of lintseed tea. After the fourth blister, she drank for some time\r\na cupful of _infusum amarum_ twice a day, and continued to recover\r\nslowly: and tho’ during the remaining part of the winter she was, as\r\nusually, a good deal troubled with a cough, yet in the spring she got\r\nfree from it, and is now in her ordinary health.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Christian Mʿewen, aged 21, had laboured under a cough, thick\r\nspitting, pain of her breast, and pains in her sides affecting her\r\nbreathing, for about a twelvemonth: and after getting, by proper\r\nremedies, in a good measure free from those complaints, her cough, from\r\ncatching a fresh cold, increased to a greater degree than ever, became\r\nhard and dry, and was attended with a constant difficulty of breathing,\r\npain in her left side, and head-ach. After having been seven or eight\r\ndays in this condition, she was admitted into the Royal Infirmary,\r\nJanuary 9th, 1757. As her pulse was small, tho’ very quick, _viz._\r\nbeating 130 in a minute, I thought it unnecessary to bleed her, as\r\nfrom former experience I did not doubt but that blistering alone would\r\nrelieve her: I ordered, therefore, a large blister to be applied to her\r\nleft side, where she complained of pain, and prescribed for her the\r\nfollowing julep:\r\n\r\n  ℞ _Aqu. menth. simp. spirit. Minderer. ana_ ℥ iij. _acet. scillit._ ℥\r\n  i. _sacchar. alb._ ℥ ij. _misce; cap. coch._ ij. _ter in die_.\r\n\r\nShe was also desired to breathe frequently over the steam of hot water,\r\nand to drink lintseed tea.\r\n\r\nJanuary 10th. Her pulse beat only 112 times in a minute, and was\r\nsomewhat fuller than on the 9th. The blister was not removed till late\r\nin the evening, and made a plentiful discharge. The cough having been\r\nso severe last night, as to keep her from sleep, I ordered her the\r\nfollowing anodyne draught:\r\n\r\n  ℞ _Spirit. Minderer._ ℥ ss. _acet. scillit._ ȝ i. _syr. papav. alb._\r\n  ȝ vi. _misce; cap. hor. somni._\r\n\r\nJan. 11th. The cough easier last night; difficulty of breathing less;\r\npulse 108 in a minute. Ordered the anodyne draught to be repeated, and\r\nthe use of the julep, with _acet. scillit._ to be continued.\r\n\r\nJan. 12th. Pulse slower; cough and pain of the side easier; but still\r\ncomplains of a head-ach.\r\n\r\nJan. 13th. Pulse 94 in a minute; cough continues easier in the night,\r\nbut is troublesome in the day-time.\r\n\r\nJan. 14th. Every way better; pulse only 80 in a minute. As her cough\r\nis still bound, ordered her, besides the medicines above-mentioned, a\r\npectoral decoction of _rad. alth._ &c.\r\n\r\nJan. 15th. Cough and other complaints in a great measure removed; pulse\r\n65 in a minute.\r\n\r\nFrom this time her cough gave her little trouble; but on the 18th she\r\ncomplained of a pain in the _epigastrium_, with sickness at stomach,\r\nwant of apetite, and a giddiness in her head, which were considerably\r\nrelieved by a vomit, _infusum amarum_, and stomachic purges; and were\r\nalmost wholly cured by the return of her menses on the 5th of February,\r\nafter an interval of eight weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. A girl 21 months old, who had (December 1756) a great load of\r\nthe small-pox, and not of a good kind, with a cough and obstructed\r\nbreathing, was, on the seventh day from the eruption, blistered on the\r\nback; by which the pulse was lessened from 200 to 156 strokes in a\r\nminute. Next day her legs were also blistered, and the pulse thereby\r\nfell to 136. But the child’s lungs being much oppressed, and her throat\r\nbeing so full of pustules that she could scarce swallow any thing, she\r\ndied towards the end of the ninth day.\r\n\r\n\r\nI could add several other cases of the remarkable effects of blisters\r\nin lessening the quickness of the pulse in coughs attended with fever,\r\npain in the side, and pituitous infarction of the lungs: but those\r\nabove may be sufficient to put this matter out of doubt, as well as to\r\nremove any prejudice, that may still remain against the free use of so\r\nefficacious a remedy.\r\n\r\nIn a true peripneumony, especially where the inflammation is great,\r\nrepeated bleeding is the principal remedy, and blisters early applied\r\nare not so proper. But when the peripneumony is of a mixed kind;\r\nwhen the lungs are not so much inflamed as loaded with a pituitous\r\nmatter; when bleeding gives but little relief; when the pulse, tho’\r\nquick, is small; when the patient is little able to bear evacuations,\r\nand the disease has continued for a considerable time; in all these\r\ncases blistering will produce remarkable good effects, and, far from\r\nincreasing, will generally lessen the frequency of the pulse, and\r\nfever, more speedily than any other remedy.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when the fever and frequency of the pulse proceed\r\nfrom a true inflammation of the lungs, from large obstructions tending\r\nto suppuration, or from an open ulcer in them, blisters will be of less\r\nuse, nay, sometimes will do harm, except in the last case, where they,\r\nas well as issues and setons, are often beneficial, tho’ seldom able\r\nto compleat a cure. But as in pituitous infarctions of the lungs, with\r\ncough and fever, repeated blisters applied to the back and sides are\r\nfar preferable to issues or setons, so these last seem most proper in\r\nan open ulcer of the lungs. The former make a greater and more sudden\r\nderivation, and are therefore adapted to acute cases; the latter act\r\nmore slowly, but for a much longer time, and are therefore best suited\r\nto chronic diseases. Further, while blisters evacuate chiefly the\r\nserous humours, issues and setons generally discharge true purulent\r\nmatter, and on this account may be of greatest service in internal\r\nulcers.\r\n\r\nIn what manner blisters may lessen the fever and frequency of the\r\npulse attending internal inflammations, I have elsewhere endeavoured\r\nto explain[32]; and shall only add here, that in the cases above\r\nrecited, where the quick pulse and feverishness proceeded more from a\r\npituitous infarction than a true inflammation of the lungs, blisters,\r\nby relieving this organ, in some measure, of the load of humours\r\noppressing it, would render the circulation through its vessels freer,\r\nand consequently lessen the quickness of the pulse, and other feverish\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\nIt may not, however, be improper briefly to point out the reason,\r\nwhy blisters, which have been observed to be remarkably efficacious,\r\neven when early applied, in pleurisies[33], are less so in true\r\nperipneumonies. This difference, I imagine, may be accounted for from\r\nthere being no immediate communication between the pulmonary vessels\r\nand those of the sides and back, to which the blisters are applied;\r\nwhereas the _pleura_, and intercostal muscles, are furnished with\r\nblood-vessels from the intercostal arteries, which also supply the\r\nteguments of the _thorax_: so that while a greater flow of serous\r\nhumours, and also indeed of red blood, is derived into the vessels of\r\nthe external parts, to which the vesicatories are applied, the force\r\nof the fluids in the vessels of the inflamed _pleura_, or intercostal\r\nmuscles, must be considerably lessened. Further, as the intercostal\r\nmuscles and _pleura_ are, as well as the teguments of the _thorax_,\r\nsupplied with nerves from the _true_ intercostals, blisters applied to\r\nthe back and sides may perhaps, on this account also, have a greater\r\neffect in relieving inflammations there than in the lungs, which have\r\nnerves from the eighth pair, and from the _intercostals_ improperly so\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\nEdinburgh, May 23d, 1757.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extract of a Letter from Dr._ Whytt, _Professor of Medicine in the\r\nUniversity of_ Edinburgh, _and F. R. S. to Dr._ Pringle, _F.R.S._\r\n\r\n                                               Edinburgh, 10 Nov. 1757.\r\n\r\nWHAT you remark with regard to blisters being freely used by the\r\nphysicians at London, in the cases mentioned in the paper I last sent\r\nyou, is very just, and indeed what I knew; but altho’ their efficacy\r\nin such circumstances is now generally acknowleged both in England\r\nand Scotland, yet I do not remember that their remarkable quality in\r\nlessening the quickness of the pulse has been particularly attended to.\r\nThis, therefore, I thought it might not be amiss to ascertain by a few\r\ncareful observations.\r\n\r\nI agree intirely with you, as to the use of blisters in fevers; being\r\nof opinion, that when there is no particular part obstructed or\r\ninflamed, they are of little service, and sometimes hurtful, unless\r\nperhaps towards the end, when the pulse begins to sink. Nay, in fevers,\r\nwhere the substance of the brain is affected, and not its membranes,\r\nI have never found any sensible benefit from blisters: and I always\r\nsuspect the brain itself affected, when a fever and delirium come on\r\nwithout any preceding head-ach, or redness in the _tunica albuginea_ of\r\nthe eyes. This kind of fever I have met with several times, and have\r\nobserved it to be generally fatal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXVI. _A remarkable Instance of Four rough Stones, that were\r\ndiscovered in an human urinary Bladder, contrary to the received\r\nOpinion; and successfully extracted by the lateral Method of Cutting\r\nfor the Stone. By Mr._ Joseph Warner, _F. R. S. and Surgeon to_\r\nGuy’s-Hospital.\r\n\r\n[Read Feb. 23, 1758.]\r\n\r\nTHE favourable reception those few papers have met with from the Royal\r\nSociety, which I have done myself the honour of addressing to them,\r\nencourages me to take the liberty of offering the following account to\r\ntheir consideration: and I am the more immediately induced to submit\r\nthis paper to their perusal, as the fact hereafter related may possibly\r\nbe not esteemed a matter of mere curiosity; since it is probable,\r\nthat the inferences deduced from the history of the subsequent case,\r\nwhen attended to, may prove of the greatest consequence to the future\r\nease and welfare of the patient, as well as be a means of preventing\r\nthe operator from falling into such errors, as cannot fail of drawing\r\nan imputation upon his character, in the practice of one of the most\r\ncapital and difficult undertakings in his profession.\r\n\r\nIt is a maxim laid down by the most judicious and best received writers\r\nupon operations in surgery, that when the surface of a stone, which\r\nhas been extracted from the bladder, appears to be totally rough, it\r\namounts to a proof of its having been there alone. But notwithstanding\r\nI admit it is from experience found, that the observation is in general\r\nwell grounded, it may nevertheless appear, from the following case,\r\nthat this rule is not unexceptionable: for which reason perhaps it may\r\nbe thought right, that we should not be determined from circumstances\r\nonly; but, on the contrary, that it is necessary for every surgeon to\r\ntake such methods during the operation, as will enable him to judge\r\nwith that degree of certainty, without which he cannot be enabled to do\r\nso.\r\n\r\nThe methods I would recommend are these: That after the extraction of\r\na stone from the bladder, tho’ the whole of its surface be rough, the\r\noperator should nevertheless introduce the forefinger of his left or\r\nright hand thro’ the wound into the cavity of the bladder; by which\r\nmeans, if the subject be under twelve years of age, he will be enabled\r\nto come in contact with every internal part of the bladder with his\r\nfinger: but if the subject be an adult, and of a corpulent habit of\r\nbody, the finger, under these circumstances, not being found to be\r\nsufficiently long for the purpose, he must have recourse to a female\r\ncatheter, or some other instrument that is nearly strait, quite smooth\r\nand polished, and of about nine or ten inches long; which will serve\r\nthe purpose equally well, if of a proper form and thickness. This is\r\nthe method I have made use of upon the like occasions of late years,\r\nwithout giving any great degree of pain to the patient, or considerably\r\nretarding the operation.\r\n\r\nSince I have had the opportunity of making the following observation,\r\nas well as a prior observation something similar to this, where two\r\nrough stones were extracted by me a few years ago from a young man’s\r\nbladder of 15 years of age, I cannot help suspecting, that there may\r\nhave been instances of one or more stones being left behind in the\r\nbladder at the time of operating, merely from the operator’s putting\r\ntoo great a confidence in this general rule. Which suspicion I am led\r\ninto from having known people, who have undergone the operation of\r\ncutting for the stone, relapse into the like disorder in a short time\r\nafter the healing of their wounds, attended with such symptoms, as have\r\nobliged them to submit to a second operation; when the stone, upon\r\nbeing extracted, has appeared of so considerable a size, as to make it\r\nsuspicious, that this stone must probably have been of a much longer\r\ngrowth, than the short time betwixt the two operations could admit of.\r\nThe maxim laid down to us by authors, of a smooth and polished stone\r\nin the bladder being never there alone, but always accompanied with\r\none or more stones of the same kind, I know no exception to. But if\r\nthis phænomenon should ever occur, the strict observance of that rule\r\n(delivered to us by judicious writers in surgery) of always searching\r\nthe bladder under the like appearances, on presumption of one or more\r\nstones being left behind, cannot be attended with any future mischief\r\nto the patient, when carefully executed by the methods recommended\r\nabove, and undoubtedly should always be strictly attended to. The\r\nsmooth and polished appearances of the surfaces of human _calculi_ are\r\nuniversally supposed to arise from their rubbing one against the other;\r\nwhich may with reason be supposed to be the case: but I confess this\r\ninference is not satisfactory to me; since it is probable, if this was\r\nthe sole cause of their smoothness, the same effect would probably be\r\nalways produced, when attended with the same degree of friction. But\r\nas this may be considered as a matter of mere speculation, I refer the\r\ndecision of this point to those of superior abilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE.\r\n\r\nMr. William Woodhams, a gentleman farmer, of a corpulent habit of body,\r\nin the 46th year of his age, now living in the parish of Udimore,\r\nwithin three miles of Rye in Sussex, was attacked about eight years ago\r\nwith severe complaints in his loins, accompanied with an incapacity of\r\nvoiding his urine without the assistance of proper medicines, which\r\nwere administered to him by a neighbouring apothecary for that purpose.\r\nThese medicines had the desired effect: they promoted a secretion, and\r\nan evacuation of urine; which appeared to be loaded with a considerable\r\nquantity of gravelly particles mixed with a _mucus_ of a whitish\r\ncolour. In the space of three weeks he had perfectly recovered from\r\nthis attack, and continued well for near five years afterwards, without\r\nany return of his complaint, except when he rode hard on horseback, or\r\ndrank more freely of strong liquors than usual. At the expiration of\r\nfive years he was seized with an acute fever, of which he recovered in\r\na few weeks.\r\n\r\nVery soon after his recovery from this illness, he began to complain\r\nof excessive pain in voiding his urine, or upon going to stool;\r\nwhich symptoms were so greatly increased for many months before he\r\nsubmitted to the operation, as to quite disable him from riding, from\r\nwalking, or from using any kind of exercise. His urine, of late, was\r\ncontinually and involuntarily flowing from him in small quantities. He\r\ncomplained of great pain and soreness in his fundament, attended with\r\na _tenesmus_. This account he delivered to me on the second day after\r\nthe operation; and at the same time he very feelingly told me, that he\r\nhad enjoyed but very few and short intervals of ease for the three last\r\nyears, till since the operation.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of January 1758, I cut him, at his own house in Sussex,\r\nhaving first prepared him for the operation in the manner, that is\r\nusual upon the like occasion. In the operation, I extracted the four\r\nstones, which I now have the honour of laying before the Royal Society.\r\nThe whole surfaces of these stones appear to be rough, not having the\r\nleast marks of ever having rubbed against each other during their\r\nconfinement in the bladder: but yet I conjecture this must frequently\r\nhave been the case, as there was no difficulty in embracing these\r\n_calculi_ with the forceps: for had they been contained in different\r\ncells or pouches in the bladder, which sometimes have been observed\r\nfrom dissections, this circumstance would, in all probability, have\r\nrendered it impracticable for me to have so immediately got at them, if\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nThe forceps was introduced only three times into the bladder for\r\neffecting the extraction of the three first stones, and only twice for\r\nthe extraction of the fourth stone. Besides these four stones, which\r\nI have presented to the Society for their inspection, I thought it\r\nnot improper to produce, at the same time, some other human _calculi_,\r\nfor their further satisfaction, each of which was found single in the\r\nurinary bladders of different subjects. The surfaces of these stones\r\nmay be observed to be much smoother than the surface of either of the\r\nfour stones, that were extracted from Mr. Woodhams’s bladder in the\r\noperation I have just now recited; and therefore it was more reasonable\r\nto expect to find each of these stones accompanied with one or more\r\nstones in the same bladder (according to the received opinion), than it\r\nwas to find more stones than one in the case of Mr. Woodhams’s, which\r\nhas given rise to these observations.\r\n\r\nBut as the fact before us does of itself shew the impropriety and\r\ndanger of determining from the surfaces of such extraneous bodies,\r\nperhaps it may be thought needless to enlarge upon this subject, to\r\nstrengthen those precautions so reasonable to be observed in this\r\noperation. However, as I have already taken notice of the smooth and\r\npolished appearances of the surfaces of such stones, as are probably\r\nnever found single in the bladder; I have produced two stones of this\r\nkind, that were extracted from the same bladder, to shew, that these\r\nstones do no more resemble those stones of Mr. Woodhams’s, than a piece\r\nof polished marble can be said to resemble a rough block of the same\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n _P. S._ I am informed, by a letter from Sussex, dated the 18th\r\n instant, that Mr. Woodhams is perfectly well in health; that the whole\r\n of his urine had passed through the urethra for the last five or six\r\n days; and that his wound will, in all probability, be soon healed.\r\n\r\n                                                         Joseph Warner.\r\n\r\nHatton-Garden, February 22. 1758.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Philos.

F.R.S.\r\nTranslated from the_ French.\r\n\r\n[Read Feb. 23, 1758.]\r\n\r\nAMONG the fish we meet with in the seas of the Antilles of America,\r\nwe find, that this I am going to describe will appear precious, from\r\nthe beautiful purple colour it produces, in the same manner, that the\r\ncuttle-fish produces its ink, if a means could be found to procure this\r\nliquor in a sufficient quantity to render it an article of commerce.\r\nThese fishes are soft, viscous, without shells, scales, or bones; are\r\nof the nature of the _polypi_, and such other kinds, without feet,\r\nfins, or any thing to supply their places. Their motion is vermicular;\r\nand, like the slugs, they wreath themselves up, and when touched make\r\nthemselves quite round.\r\n\r\nThey fill up certain membranes of the body with water. Their local\r\nmotion; _antennæ_, which they lengthen and contract; and a great many\r\nother properties, which they have in common with snails, slugs, and\r\nturbinated shell-fish, made me call them naked snails: and altho’ they\r\nhave not the most essential qualities of snails, I thought I might\r\ngive them the name; for they have no particular appellation in this\r\ncountry. Some call them piss-a beds, some sea-cats, and others a less\r\nmodest name, _tapecon_, taken from Pliny. The Negroes and country\r\npeople disagree upon this subject; and therefore I thought all their\r\nnames ought to be rejected, in order to adopt a more significant one,\r\nwhich I have given them; and that altho’ they are without shells, a\r\nquality essential to snails, they had a right to that class by their\r\nother properties and qualities.\r\n\r\nThis fish is commonly four inches long, and two thick; of a greenish\r\ncolour, spotted with black, each of which forms a circle. The under\r\npart is like that of snails, flat, with kinds of _mamillæ_, or\r\nrugosities, which are adhesive; by means of which they advance in a\r\nvermicular motion; and when touched become round, by retracting their\r\nneck and head; and afterwards protrude them considerably, according to\r\ntheir motion and progression, crawling upon rocks to seek their food.\r\n\r\nThe head of this animal has a flatness, or is inclinable to a square or\r\nparallelogram. On each side there are membranes or skins, which form\r\nkinds of ears; and under them others, which at times fill with water,\r\nand are then transparent. Under this thick skin there is a _cranium_,\r\nof a kind of coriaceous or cartilaginous matter; and in the _cranium_\r\nwe find the brain, which is a white substance, and very firm. At the\r\nbasis of the head its oval wide mouth is placed, being above two lines\r\nlong, which often discovers a white hard edge, with which he crops the\r\nfucus’s, and other sea-plants, for his nourishment.\r\n\r\nAbout half an inch from the ears there are two horns, or _antennæ_,\r\nlike those of some testaceous animals, which serve them for eyes; and\r\nthese _antennæ_ extend and contract at will, turning to either side\r\nalso. The _oesophagus_ begins at the upper and inner part of the mouth,\r\nwhich is a delicate long tube; near which there is another thick one,\r\nand made nearly like the colon, which leads to a bag, or the first\r\nstomach, which may be likened to the craw of a fowl: it is always\r\nfilled with fucus mixed with sand. Sometimes this stomach is double, or\r\nat least lengthens itself considerably, and the aliment parts it, as it\r\nwere, into two portions. After this craw, or stomach, we find another,\r\nwhich performs the same office with the gizzard of fowls. The membranes\r\nare thick, and are set with twelve stones, or horny pieces, of a bright\r\nyellow colour, and as transparent as fine yellow amber, ending in\r\npoints like a diamond; so that the great side, or basis, is set into\r\nthe membrane of the gizzard as a diamond in its socket: others differ\r\nin size, having different figures, that in acting all together they may\r\nbe able to break and grind the herbs the animal feeds upon, as well by\r\nthe strength of the muscle or gizzard, which puts them into action, as\r\nby the situation of these stones, assisted by grains of sand found in\r\nit, turning the whole by this trituration into a liquor. Afterwards,\r\nwhat was thus triturated by the power of the gizzard passes into a\r\nthird belly or stomach, which is covered by a purple body, resembling\r\nthe _parenchyma_ of the liver, and nearly of the same consistence: then\r\nthis belly turns into a long tube, which surrounds this _parenchyma_,\r\nand is covered in like manner by a very fine membrane: it is full\r\nof a white liquor, like chyle, and goes to discharge itself into\r\nanother reservoir, at the side of which is a yellowish gland, like\r\na _pancreas_. From these two bodies or glands one of which may be\r\ncalled hepatic, and the other pancreatic, two conduits pass out; that\r\nof the _pancreas_ is white, the other of a blackish purple: the first\r\nconducts its chyle, condensed, into a reservoir or bladder, which may\r\nbe resembled to the _receptaculum chyli_ of Pequet, and from thence\r\npasses to the fecal matter: the other conducts to a body made like the\r\nmesentery, but which is always found out of the common capacity or\r\ncavity, in which all the _viscera_ are contained; which I thus describe:\r\n\r\nThis common capacity is very large, beginning at the head and ending\r\nat the tail of the fish: it is sometimes filled with a yellowish\r\nwater, and is formed by the fleshy body of the animal; which is only a\r\nmembrane composed of fibres every way interwoven together, open at the\r\ntop, where the organs are situated, which contain the purple juice.\r\n\r\nThere is a hollow upon the back of the animal, where the canal, filled\r\nwith a reddish juice, passes out, carrying it to a fringed body like a\r\nmesentery; and it is there the purple juice is brought to perfection;\r\nand afterwards goes to a long sack lying under a kind of horny plate,\r\nnot like the bone of the cuttle-fish, but like the bone of the _sepia_,\r\nor little cuttle-fish, which we call _le couteau_. This bone, or\r\nhorny substance, is transparent; and is of a triangular figure, or\r\napproaching the form of a bivalve shell. On the right side it is\r\nfastened by a strong cartilaginous muscle, which binds it to the body\r\nof the animal; and on the left it is open and detached, and easy to be\r\npulled up: then it is easy to see underneath both the mesenteric body,\r\nand the tube or reservoir of the purple juice. This bone, or horny\r\nplate, is covered by a loose membrane, which is by no means attached to\r\nit, but capable of being filled and inflated with water or wind.\r\n\r\nThe whole is covered with two membranes, which are continuations of the\r\nflesh of the fish’s body: the membranes are loose, and larger than are\r\nnecessary to the bone: they are wrinkled or rumpled over one another,\r\nto cover the whole, and to defend the bone and _viscera_ from all kinds\r\nof pressure; but they are ready to stretch one from the other, and\r\nleave the parts destined for the purple juice uncovered. They begin a\r\nlittle under the neck, and extend, in the female animal, to the tail,\r\nwhich is flat; and in the male they do not go so low, but end at some\r\ndistance from the tail.\r\n\r\nThe females are oviparous; for eggs are found in the grand cavity, at\r\nthe side of the pancreatic body.\r\n\r\nI have already said, that when the animal is touched, he makes himself\r\nround, and throws out his purple juice, as the cuttle-fish does his\r\nink. This juice is of a beautiful deep colour: it tinges linen, and the\r\ntincture is difficult to get out. It remains at present to try if we\r\ncan collect a sufficient quantity of this juice, and to find a means of\r\npreserving the tincture; which would then be certainly of great value:\r\nto which purpose I may apply myself.\r\n\r\nWhen the fish is boiled, or put into spirits, it shrinks up, and\r\nloses two thirds of its size; because all the water, which is in\r\nthe interstices of the fibres, is dissipated, and the dried fibres\r\ncontract: which clearly appears from dissecting them.\r\n\r\nDated at Guadaloupe, 20 Mar. 1757.\r\n\r\n                                                             Peyssonel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXVIII. _New Observations upon the Worms that form Sponges. By_ John\r\nAndrew Peyssonel, _M. D. F.R.S. Translated from the_ French.\r\n\r\n[Read Feb. 23, 1758.]\r\n\r\nTHE existence of the nests of corallines and lithophyta, and the\r\nmechanism of their polypi, made me conjecture, that it was the same\r\nwith respect to sponges; that animals, nested in the interstices of\r\ntheir fibres, gave them their origin and growth: but I had not yet seen\r\nnor discovered the insects, nor observed their work. Sponges appeared\r\nto me only as skeletons: but I at length discovered these worms, which\r\nform sponges, in the four following species:\r\n\r\n1. _Spongia Americana tubo similis_; The tube-like sponge of Plumier.\r\n\r\n2. _Spongia Americana longissima funiculo similis_; The cord-like\r\nsponge of Plumier.\r\n\r\n3. _Spongia Americana capitata et digitata_; The fingered sponge of\r\nPlumier.\r\n\r\n4. _Spongia Americana favo similis_; The honeycomb sponge of Plumier.\r\n\r\nThese four kinds only differ in form: they have the same qualities, are\r\nmade by the same kinds of worm, and what may be said of the one agrees\r\nexactly with all the rest; for I made the same observations upon them\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThey may be classed among the _spongiæ hyrcinæ_, so called by J.\r\nBauhin, because of the roughness of their fibres, by a metaphor, from\r\npieces covered with mud; or among those called by Pliny _tragos_, or\r\n_aphysiæ_, being foul, and difficult to cleanse; and may take the name,\r\nwhich Father Plumier has given them, drawn from their figure.\r\n\r\nThese four kinds of sponges are composed of hard, firm, dirty fibres,\r\nsometimes brittle; separated one from another, having large hollows,\r\nor cylindrical tubes, dispersed thro’ their substance. These tubes\r\nare smooth within. The interstices of their fibres are filled with a\r\nmucilaginous gluey matter, when the sponge is just taken out of the\r\nsea. The mucilage is of a blackish colour, soon putrifies in the water,\r\nor falls into dust when dried in the sun.\r\n\r\nWhen a fresh sponge is squeezed, this mucilage comes out frothy, by\r\nthe mixture of the windings of its fibres: it always issues forth with\r\nsand, or little parcels of shells crushed by the sea. These fibres,\r\nwhich consist of the twisted doubles of the sponge, form as it were a\r\nlabyrinth filled with worms, which are easily crushed, and their juice\r\nis confused with the mucilage; but having carefully torn the sponges,\r\nand their gross fibres, I discovered the living worms, such as I shall\r\nmention hereafter.\r\n\r\nThese species of sponge commonly grow upon sandy bottoms. At their\r\norigins we perceive, as it were, a nodule of sand, or other matter,\r\nalmost petrified, round which the worms begin to work, and round which\r\nthey retire, as to their last seat or refuge; where I had the pleasure\r\nof seeing them play, exercise themselves, and retire, by examining them\r\nwith the microscope; and I have even made my observations without its\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Description of the Worms which form the Sponges._\r\n\r\nThe worms I found in these kinds of sponges are about one-third of a\r\nline thick, and two or three lines in length. They are so transparent,\r\nthat one may discern their _viscera_ thro’ their coverings and\r\nsubstance: the blood may be seen to circulate, and all their parts to\r\nact. They have a conic figure, with a small black head furnished with\r\ntwo pincers: the other extremity is almost square, and much larger than\r\nthe head. Upon the back may be seen two white streaks or fillets, as if\r\nthey contained the chyle: these two canals are parallel to each other\r\nfrom the head to the other extremity, where they come together. In the\r\nmiddle, where the belly and _viscera_ ought to be placed, a blackish\r\nmatter is perceivable, which has a kind of circulation: sometimes\r\nit fills all the body of the worm, sometimes it gathers towards the\r\nhead, or at the other end, and sometimes it follows the motion of the\r\nanimal. This vermicular motion or progression begins at the posterior\r\nextremity, and ends at the head, which is pushed, and consequently\r\nadvances forward. I kept these worms alive out of the sponge, quite\r\ndetached from it, more than an hour, having examined them thoroughly\r\nwith a middling magnifier; for a great magnifier would be the grave of\r\nthe insect.\r\n\r\nI was surprised, after having finished my observations, when I put them\r\nnear a piece of the fresh sponge, where the nests were moist, and from\r\nwhich I had pulled them, to see them enter into them, and disappear,\r\nbeing lost in the windings of the tubes. I thought to have found them\r\nagain; but it was a difficult task to search for them. I crushed them,\r\nor they were themselves mashed in the tubes, which I pressed, and of\r\nwhich I had consequently spoiled the texture; but I could not find\r\nthem; and this happened several times.\r\n\r\nThese worms have no particular lodge: they walk indifferently into\r\nthe tubular labyrinth. So that, without offence to Pliny and other\r\nnaturalists, I do not see, that it is in their power to dilate and\r\ncontract the bodies of the sponges; which always remain in the same\r\nstate of magnitude, without being any way sensible to the touch, or\r\nany other motion of the sea, nor to any other accident whatsoever,\r\nbeing an inanimate body; for the animal sensitive life, or whatever\r\nyou will have it, belongs only to the worms, that form these bodies,\r\nand which are their dwelling-places; and which, by the slaver or juice\r\nthey deposit, make the sponge increase or grow, as bees, wasps, and\r\nespecially the wood-lice of America, increase their nests or cells.\r\n\r\nThese sponges, nests, or cells, are attached to some solid body in the\r\nsea. Some kinds are fixed to rocks; others, as those I am speaking of,\r\nare fastened to heaps of sand, or to pieces of petrified matter, and\r\neven upon sandy bottoms; and the sea putting in motion the sand, and\r\nthe little parcels of broken shells, forces them into the holes of the\r\nsponge: there the sand binds and mixes with mucilaginous juice, and\r\nnever is loosed from it but when the sponge is well dried, or with\r\nthe mucilage when putrified, or in powder; and yet some part will\r\nremain, which it is very difficult to take out from the twisted canals,\r\nespecially in those sponges of the _tragos_ kind, so hard to cleanse.\r\nIn a word, the blood or humours, which the ancients have observed, is\r\nno other than the mucilage or juice of the substance of these worms.\r\n\r\nDated at Guadaloupe, 1 March, 1757.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXIX. _Account of an Experiment, by which it appears, that Salt of\r\nSteel does not enter the Lacteal Vessels; with Remarks. In a Letter to\r\nthe Rev._ Tho. Birch, _D. D. Secr. R. S. By_ Edward Wright, _M. D._\r\n\r\n[Read Mar. 2, 1758.]\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nTHO’ iron is universally allowed to be one of the most powerful\r\nmedicines now in use, yet many physicians observing, that the _fæces_\r\nof patients, who used it either in a metallic or saline form, were\r\ntinged of a black colour, have been led to think, that, in a metallic\r\nstate, it could not be reduced into particles fine enough to be\r\nreceived by the lacteal vessels; and if taken in a saline form, that\r\nit underwent a precipitation in the intestines, by which, being\r\nreduced to an earth or calx, it was in like manner rendered incapable\r\nof making its way into the blood. But the accurate experiments, with\r\nwhich Signor Menghini has favoured the public in the Memoirs of the\r\nBononian Academy[34], sufficiently prove, that the ore and filings of\r\niron, finely levigated, enter the blood in considerable quantity; as\r\ndoes also the _crocus_, _calx_, or earthy part of the metal, tho’ in\r\nless proportion than the two former, which were found to act with a\r\nviolent _stimulus_ on the vessels, and to have dissolved and broke the\r\n_crasis_ of the blood of different animals, that had used them for some\r\nweeks in large doses mixed with their ordinary food. Tho’ it must be\r\nallowed, that these experiments are very curious, yet the subject seems\r\nto require a further inquiry, viz. _Whether iron is capable of entering\r\nthe blood in a state of solution, or under a saline form_: for, from\r\nthe violent _stimulus_, as well as from the dissolution of the blood,\r\nand other symptoms brought on by the use of the ore and filings, these\r\nsubstances (not being properly dissolved) appear to have acted in a\r\nmanner so grossly mechanical, that, whatever Signor Menghini may think,\r\nvery little is to be concluded from them, with regard to the action of\r\niron on the human body, in such cases, as indicate its use, and where a\r\nrational physician would think proper to prescribe it as a medicine.\r\n\r\nHaving read Signor Menghini’s memoir, I recollected, that in the year\r\n1753 I had, with the assistance of two friends, made the following\r\nexperiment, in order to discover, whether iron, in a saline form, is\r\ncapable of entering the lacteals.\r\n\r\nAn ounce and a half of salt of steel dissolved in a sufficient quantity\r\nof water, filtrated and mixed with about a pound of bread and milk,\r\nwere forced down the throat of a dog, that had been kept fasting for\r\n36 hours. An hour after he had swallowed this mixture, having secured\r\nhim in a supine posture, as is usual in such experiments, we opened the\r\nabdomen, and observed the lacteal vessels, like white threads, running\r\nalong the mesentery in a very beautiful manner. Upon slitting open part\r\nof the small guts, we there found a good deal of the mixture, which\r\nappeared frothy, but without any black colour, or the least sign of the\r\nsalt being precipitated; and struck a deep inky colour with infusion\r\nof galls. Tho’ the white colour of the lacteals convinced us, that\r\nthey were full of chyle, yet, as it would have been impossible to have\r\ncollected a sufficient quantity of it from them, we found it necessary\r\nto open the thorax, and tie the thoracic duct a little above the\r\nreceptacle, which, from the ligature, soon became turgid, the animal\r\nbeing alive and warm, and the chyle still continuing its course towards\r\nthe thoracic duct. Having cut open the receptacle, we easily collected\r\na sufficient quantity of chyle, and immediately mixed therewith, drop\r\nby drop, infusion of galls; a very simple and easy method, by which an\r\nincredibly small quantity of salt of steel may be discovered in most\r\nliquors: but not the smallest change of colour was observed, tho’ they\r\nwere rubbed together for some time, and allowed to stand several hours.\r\nNow had there been a single atom (so to speak) of the salt in so small\r\na portion of chyle, as that used in this experiment, which was, as near\r\nas I could guess, some what less than half an ounce, it is not to be\r\nimagined, that it could have failed to discover itself by this method\r\nof trial; for upon adding one fourth of a grain of the salt, this\r\nmixture instantly became of a bright purple: and I have found, by other\r\nexperiments, that the smallest quantity of salt of steel shews itself\r\nas readily in the chyle by galls, as in any other liquor of the same\r\nconsistence.\r\n\r\nThis experiment (which was as fair as could have been desired),\r\ntogether with another observation I have made, _viz._ that neither the\r\nblood nor urine of patients, during the use of salt of steel, in the\r\nleast change colour with galls, renders it more than probable, that\r\nthis salt _does not enter the blood_.\r\n\r\nAs the salt was found to have undergone no change in the small guts,\r\nit appears, that it is not prevented from entering the lacteals by its\r\nbeing decomposed or precipitated, as has been imagined; but, on the\r\ncontrary, that what renders it incapable of being received by these\r\nvessels, is its _astringency_: for the lacteals seem to be endowed with\r\nthat admirable faculty of admitting such particles of pure chyle as\r\nthey happen to be in contact with, and of accommodating their diameters\r\nto them, at the same time that by their natural irritability, and\r\npower of constriction they obstinately exclude such as are astringent;\r\nwhich, were they to enter the lacteals, would either produce dangerous\r\nobstructions in these vessels, or, if they got into the blood, would\r\noccasion polypous concretions in the larger vessels, or coagulations\r\nincapable of being transmitted thro’ the minute vessels of the lungs;\r\nthe effects of which would be either sudden death, or at least\r\ninflammations and suppurations from obstructions in the pulmonary\r\nvessels; inconveniences, which nature, by precluding astringents from\r\nentering the lacteals, has carefully and wisely avoided.\r\n\r\nSalt of steel, taken internally, must retain its astringency until it\r\nbe precipitated; which can scarce ever fail to happen in the great\r\nguts, from the putrid _fæces_ they contain, which are always observed\r\nto be tinged of a black colour from the metallic basis of the salt,\r\npart of which, as it has little or no astringency, may, no doubt,\r\nenter the blood, as Signor Menghini observed of the _crocus_, which\r\nis the same substance; and we know, from the experiments of Lister\r\nand Musgrave[35], that particles much grosser than those of the white\r\nchyle, provided they be not astringent, or very acrid, are conveyed by\r\nthe lacteals. But the metallic basis being separated from its acid, and\r\nthus reduced to a mere calx or earth, can scarce be supposed to have\r\nany medicinal quality whatsoever, or at least to have any share in the\r\nvirtues justly attributed to salt of steel.\r\n\r\nAs this salt is not only astringent, and consequently a strengthener,\r\nbut at the same time acts with a gentle _stimulus_, all its virtues\r\n(which are known to be very great in diseases, where the fluids are\r\neither viscid, cold, and phlegmatic, or dissolved and watery, from a\r\nlaxity of the solids) may be accounted for from its immediate effects\r\non the stomach and _primæ viæ_, and on the system of the solids in\r\ngeneral by consent; which it would be needless to illustrate by similar\r\nexamples, because well known to every one the least versed in medical\r\nstudies. I shall therefore only beg leave, from the obvious qualities\r\nof this medicine, and from what has been observed above, to deduce the\r\nfollowing corollaries.\r\n\r\n1. That salt of steel has no deobstruent or aperient virtue by any\r\nimmediate action, that it can possibly have on the blood, or other\r\nanimal fluids, as some have imagined; but that, on the contrary, it\r\nowes this quality to its _not entering the blood_, which it would\r\notherwise coagulate, and to _its action on the solids alone_.\r\n\r\n2. That in diseases proceeding from a laxity of the solids, great care\r\nought to be taken to restore and invigorate the _primæ viæ_; since a\r\nmedicine (and this we may presume not the only one) whose immediate\r\naction is confined to those parts, is yet found by experience to\r\nproduce so salutary effects in such diseases.\r\n\r\n3. That as this salt does not enter the blood, and consequently cannot\r\nbe in danger of too much stimulating or constricting the vessels, on\r\nwhich it only acts by consent, it may, in small doses, be successfully\r\nused in many cases, where it has been imagined to be hurtful,\r\nparticularly in consumptions of the lungs, so frequent and fatal in\r\nthis island; which are commonly attended with too great a laxity of\r\nthe _primæ viæ_, and of the solids in general, tho’ they seem more\r\nimmediately to proceed from a laxity and weakness of the pulmonary\r\nvessels; in which circumstances it must be of the utmost consequence\r\nto restore the tone of those principal organs of chylification, the\r\n_primæ viæ_; as good chyle not only corrects the acrimony of the blood,\r\nwhich in the advanced stages of consumptions so much prevails, but\r\nlikewise saves a great deal of labour, which the lungs (already too\r\nmuch oppressed) must otherwise undergo from a crude and ill-concocted\r\nchyle. Agreeably to this we find, in the _Essays Physical and Literary_\r\nof Edinburgh[36], two well-vouched histories of patients far gone in\r\nconsumptions, with the usual symptoms of pain in the breast, cough,\r\ngross spitting of fetid matter, difficulty of breathing, hectic fits,\r\nand morning sweats, perfectly cured in a few weeks, by the use of the\r\nHartfell-Spaw near Moffat; which, contrary to what is observed in most\r\nnatural chalybeat waters, contains a fixed vitriol of iron.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese, Sir, are the few observations I had to make at present on this\r\nsubject. I have taken the liberty to address them to you, in order, if\r\nyou shall think proper, to be communicated to your illustrious Society;\r\nwhich, I hope, will continue to latest posterity those interesting\r\nresearches for the advancement of every branch of natural knowlege, by\r\nwhich it has already acquired so much and so deserved honour; and am,\r\nwith the greatest respect,\r\n\r\n                                 SIR,\r\n                  Your most obedient humble Servant,\r\n                            Edward Wright.\r\n\r\nStrand, Feb. 28. 1758.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXX. _A Dissertation on the Antiquity of Glass in Windows. In a Letter\r\nto the Rev._ Tho. Birch, _D. D. Secret. R. S. By the Rev._ John Nixon,\r\n_M. A. F.R.S._\r\n\r\n[Read Mar. 2, 1758.]\r\n\r\n                                                 London, March 2. 1758.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI Had the honour last winter to lay before the Royal Society a few\r\nobservations upon some of the curiosities found at Herculaneum,\r\n_&c._[37]. Among other articles, I just mentioned a piece of a plate\r\nof white glass; and now beg leave to inquire into the uses, to which\r\nsuch plates might be applied in the early age, to which this fragment\r\nundoubtedly belongs.\r\n\r\nAnd here a person, who forms his ideas of ancient customs by what\r\nhe sees practised in later times, may be ready to offer several\r\nconjectures; in some of which he will, probably, be mistaken; as in\r\nothers he may be justified by the genuine evidences of antiquity.\r\n\r\nAnd, first, It is obvious to imagine, that such plates might serve\r\nfor _specula_, or looking-glasses. And, indeed, that _specula_ were\r\nanciently made, not only of metals, and some stones, as the[38]\r\nphengites, _&c._ but also of glass, may, I think, be collected from\r\nPliny, who, having mentioned the city of Sidon as formerly famous for\r\nglass-houses, adds immediately afterwards, _Siquidem etiam specula\r\nexcogitaverat_[39]. But then it is to be observed, that before the\r\napplication of quicksilver in the constructing of these glasses (which,\r\nI presume, is of no great antiquity), the reflection of images by such\r\n_specula_ must have been effected by their being besmeared _behind_,\r\nor tinged _thro’_ with some dark colour, especially black, which would\r\nobstruct the refraction of the rays of light[40]. Upon these hypotheses\r\n(supposing the tincture to be given after fusion) the _lamina_ before\r\nus may be allowed to be capable of answering the purpose here assigned.\r\n\r\nIt may further be suggested, that plates of this kind might be intended\r\nto be wrought into lens’s, or convex glasses, either for burning, or\r\nmagnifying objects placed in their focus. But this designation cannot\r\nbe supported by proper vouchers from antiquity. On the contrary, we\r\nare informed, that the ancients used either _specula_[41] of metal, or\r\nballs[42] of glass for the former of these purposes; as it is well\r\nknown, that glass was not applied to the latter, in optical uses, till\r\nthe beginning of the XIIIth century[43].\r\n\r\nHowever, we may with greater probability propose another use, for\r\nwhich the ancients might employ such plates of glass, as are now under\r\nconsideration, _viz._ the adorning the walls of their apartments by\r\nway of wainscot. This I take to be the meaning of the _vitreæ cameræ_\r\nmentioned by Pliny[44]; who intimates, that this fashion took its rise\r\nfrom glass being used by M. Scaurus[45] for embellishing the scene\r\nof that magnificent theatre, which he erected for exhibiting shows\r\nto the Roman people in his ædileship[46]. And we may collect from\r\nthe same author[47] (what is further confirmed by his contemporary\r\n[48]Seneca), that this kind of ornament had been admitted, in his\r\ntime, into chambers in houses, baths, _&c._ Whether the plates used for\r\nthis purpose were stained with various colours (as mentioned above),\r\nor had tints of divers kinds applied to the back part of them, I shall\r\nnot pretend to determine: but in either way they would have a very\r\nagreeable effect.\r\n\r\nThe last destination, which the obvious congruity of the thing itself,\r\ncountenanced by the practice of many ages past, as well as of the\r\npresent time, would induce one to ascribe to such plates of glass, is\r\nthat of windows for houses, baths, portico’s, _&c._ But I am sensible,\r\nthat whoever should be hardy enough to advance such an hypothesis,\r\nwould be censured as an innovator, in opposing the general opinion of\r\nthe connoisseurs in antiquity. These gentlemen are almost unanimous in\r\nasserting, that whenever we meet with mention made of _specularia_ in\r\nancient writers (especially those _of_, or near _to_, the age, to which\r\nwe must refer this fragment), we are to understand by that term nothing\r\nbut fences made of _laminæ_, either of a certain stone called from its\r\ntransparent quality _lapis specularis_[49], brought first from Hispania\r\nCiterior, and afterwards found in Cyprus, Cappadocia, Sicily, and\r\nAfrica; or of another stone of the same nature, _viz._ the phengites.\r\nThese, tho’ expressly distinguished from each other by Pliny[50],\r\nare yet reckoned by some moderns[51] as one and the same thing; and\r\nthought to have been nothing but a kind of white transparent talc, of\r\nwhich (according to Mons.[52] Valois) there is found a great quantity\r\nin Moscovy at this day.\r\n\r\nNow that this _lapis specularis_, or phengites, was really used for\r\nwindows by the ancient Romans in their houses, _&c._ cannot be denied;\r\nsince (according to the opinion of the learned[53] in antiquity) this\r\nusage is mentioned by Seneca[54] among other improvements in luxury\r\nintroduced in his time. But whether it was so used exclusive of other\r\nmaterials (particularly glass), may, I think, admit a doubt. Salmasius\r\nis of opinion[55], that nothing can be determined upon this point from\r\nthe word _specular_ itself, which seems to be a generical term, equally\r\napplicable to windows of all kinds, whether consisting of the _lapis\r\nspecularis_, or any other transparent substance.\r\n\r\nAnd as (according to this learned writer) there is nothing in the term\r\n_specular_ itself, which hinders it from being extended to windows made\r\nof other materials besides those above-mentioned; so others imagine,\r\nthat there are some intimations in ancient authors, which require, that\r\nit should actually be so extended. Thus Mr. Castells, the ingenious\r\nillustrator of the villa’s of the ancients, thinks[56], that “if this\r\nhad not been the case, Palladius would not have given directions to his\r\nhusbandman to make _specularia_ in the _olearium_[57], or store-room,\r\nwhere the olives were preserved. For it appears (says this author) from\r\nPliny’s describing a temple[58] built of the _lapis specularis_, or\r\nphengites, as the greatest rarity in his time, and the mention Plutarch\r\nmakes of a room in Domitian’s palace lined with it, that it was not\r\ncommon enough for husbandmen to purchase;” _viz._ in such quantities,\r\nas were required for the purposes mentioned above.\r\n\r\nI shall not take upon me to decide upon the weight of this argument of\r\nMr. Castells; but only observe, that if any one should be induced by\r\nit to think, that the use of glass for windows may be of much greater\r\nantiquity than is commonly allowed, or even as old as the fragment,\r\nwhich occasions these remarks, he may find other probable reasons to\r\ncorroborate his opinion. As, first, that there seems to have been a\r\nnatural and obvious transition from the practice of using glass plates\r\nfor the ornamenting the walls of apartments to that of introducing\r\nlight into those apartments, (as we find the _lapis specularis_\r\nwas in fact employed at the same time for both those purposes) and\r\nconsequently it seems reasonable to suppose, that the latter of these\r\napplications could not be long in point of time after the former.\r\nBut it appears from the authorities produced above, that the former\r\nof these usages did actually subsist in the age[59] of Pliny; and\r\ntherefore before the destruction of Herculaneum, where he lost his\r\nlife[60]. From whence we may draw no improbable conclusion, that the\r\nlatter destination of plates of glass, (_viz._ for window-fences) did\r\nlikewise precede the same event.\r\n\r\nGive me leave to add further, that this presumptive argument in\r\nfavour of the antiquity of windows made of plates of glass receives\r\nan additional force from the close relation, which must be allowed to\r\nsubsist between them, and those composed of the _lapis specularis_. The\r\nformer must be looked upon as an improvement upon the other, as they\r\nanswered all the purposes of convenience, and at the same time were\r\nmore beautiful; and being the manufacture[61] of Italy, might probably\r\nbe purchased at a less expence. Upon all which accounts it seems\r\nreasonable to conclude, that one of these inventions would naturally be\r\nintroductory to the other: and consequently, that as window-lights of\r\nthe _lapis specularis_ began to be used within the memory of Seneca,\r\nwho died[62] under Nero, about _anno Christi_ 68. (_Helvic._), the\r\noriginal of those of glass may have fair pretensions to a place within\r\nthe period assigned in the foregoing paragraph, _viz._ some years\r\nbefore the destruction[63] of Herculaneum, in whose ruins the plate\r\nbefore us was buried.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo conclude: I need not observe to you, that all the evidence here\r\nproduced to prove the usage of glass-windows to have been coæval\r\nwith the fragment we are now considering, is of the conjectural kind\r\nonly: for, I must confess, I have not been able to trace it up by any\r\npositive authority higher than about 200 years short of the epocha last\r\nmentioned, _viz._ to the latter end of the third century[64], when\r\nit is expresly mentioned by Lactantius in these words:--_Manifestius\r\nest, mentem esse, quæ per oculos ea, quæ sunt opposita, transpiciat,\r\nquasi per fenestras lucente vitro aut speculari lapide obductas._--De\r\nopificio Dei, cap. v.\r\n\r\nI am,\r\n\r\n                                 SIR,\r\n                  Your most obedient humble Servant,\r\n                               J. Nixon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXI. _An Account of an extraordinary Case of the Efficacy of the Bark\r\nin the Delirium of a Fever. By_ Nicˢ. Munckley, _M. D. Physician to_\r\nGuy’s-Hospital, _and F.R.S._\r\n\r\n[Read April 6, 1758.]\r\n\r\nAS the following case contains some circumstances, which are curious in\r\nthemselves, and which may be of service to be known, I have thought it\r\nproper to be laid before the Society.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday the 5th of March I was sent for to a gentleman, of about 30\r\nyears of age, who had been for some days ill of a fever. I found him\r\nwith a degree of heat considerably above what was natural, and with a\r\npulse rather low, but quick, and beating, as measured by a stop-watch,\r\nabout a hundred strokes in a minute. In this situation he continued,\r\nwithout any remarkable alteration, for the two following days; and,\r\nfrom the appearance of this disease, I imagined, that it would not be\r\nspeedily terminated. On Wednesday, the third day of my seeing him, I\r\nfound him however much better; his heat being considerably abated, and\r\nhis pulse being more than twenty strokes in a minute slower than it\r\nhad been the day before. On this alteration, so much in his favour,\r\nit might have been thought he was growing well, had it not been, that\r\nthere was no appearance either by sweat or urine, or on the skin, by\r\nwhich it could be imagined the disease was perfectly judged. On this\r\naccount no alteration was made in his treatment that day: but finding,\r\nthe next morning, that he had slept well the preceding night, and that\r\nhis pulse continued quiet, being no more than 74 strokes in a minute,\r\nhe was allowed to get up in the evening, to have his bed made; and I\r\nshould have thought him well, had not every appearance of a critical\r\nseparation been still wanting. On this account, I thought him to be\r\nvery liable to a return of his fever; and therefore, when early the\r\nnext morning I was informed, that he had been without any sleep,\r\nand quite delirious, the whole night, I was not greatly alarmed, as\r\nthinking he had a feverish paroxysm, to which the bark would probably\r\nput an end. When I saw him that morning, I found him very delirious;\r\nbut, to my great surprise, quite free from all kind of fever whatever;\r\nhis pulse being then as calm as it had been the preceding day. In this\r\ncondition he remained all that day, and the following night; nothing,\r\nthat was attempted to relieve him, having done him the least service:\r\non the contrary, his delirium increased so much, as to make it very\r\ndifficult for the attendants to keep him in bed. The next morning he\r\nwas much as he had been the day before; his imagination continuing\r\ngreatly disturbed, and he at times laughing, and playing antic tricks,\r\nand using gestures the most opposite to his common demeanour when\r\nwell; and which, tho’ the pulse had not been so perfectly quiet, had\r\nmore the appearance of a _mania_, than of the delirium of a fever. In\r\nthis unhappy situation, there was but one thing, which seemed likely\r\nto bring the affair to a speedy determination: this it was proper to\r\nattempt, tho’ the indications for it were very obscure, and the event\r\nperfectly uncertain. On recollecting the time of this delirium’s\r\ncoming on, which was about 36 hours after the pulse had grown quiet;\r\nand perceiving, that one glass of the water, which had been made in\r\nthe night, was thick, and seemed disposed to drop a sediment; there\r\nwas some reason to suspect, and indeed to hope, that tho’ the pulse\r\nhad been perfectly calm during the whole time of the delirium, there\r\nwas something of the fever still at the bottom of this complaint.\r\nFrom these indications, obscure as they were, it was judged proper to\r\nmake a trial of the bark; which was accordingly ordered to be taken\r\nimmediately, and to be repeated every two hours. This method succeeded\r\nbeyond what could have been imagined; insomuch that it was observable,\r\neven by the attendants on this gentleman, that his mind came evidently\r\nmore and more to itself after every dose: and in the evening, after he\r\nhad taken six drachms, his urine grew thick, and dropt a lateritious\r\nsediment; and, excepting the weakness naturally consequent on such\r\nviolent emotions as he had undergone, both of mind and body, he was\r\nas well as ever he had been in his life. He hath repeated the bark at\r\nproper intervals, as is usual after intermittent fevers, and continues\r\nto this day perfectly well.\r\n\r\nThe use of the bark, in the most irregular intermittent disorders, is\r\nvery happily so well known in this island, that it might perhaps have\r\nbeen thought needless to have recited any case merely in confirmation\r\nof this practice: and I am too well aware of the insufficiency of\r\nevery thing, but a number of facts on which to found any philosophical\r\ntruth, to presume to rest any thing on one single instance only. But\r\nthe case above related is of so very extraordinary a kind, as to make\r\nit worthy of being mentioned, both on its own account, and for that\r\nanalogy, which being found by experience to subsist between diseases,\r\naffords the surest method of reasoning on practical subjects. The two\r\nremarkable circumstances of this case are, the delirium’s coming on,\r\nand continuing, without any exacerbation of the pulse; and the bark’s\r\nproving so speedy and effectual a remedy, tho’ given at a time, when\r\nthere was no appearance of any remission of the symptom, which it\r\nwas intended to remove. It hath been thought, that a quick pulse is\r\nso essential to the definition of a fever, as to be a pathognomonic\r\nsymptom of it. But experience is against this notion: perhaps the\r\npresent case is a proof of the contrary; however this be, there have\r\nnot been wanting instances, in which, towards the end of a fever, the\r\npulse has grown quiet, without the abatement of any other symptom, and\r\nthe patient hath generally lain comatose, and with the appearance of\r\none, who hath taken a large quantity of opium. Galen, in the third book\r\nof the Presages of the Pulse, mentions this symptom, and pronounces\r\nit to be almost a fatal sign: and the same thing hath happened in\r\nmore instances than one, which have come to my knowlege. May not then\r\nthe above-recited case lead to this useful inquiry, Whether in fevers\r\nof every kind, when the pulse is quiet, the bark is not proper to be\r\ngiven, and likely to prove a remedy? In this case it proved absolutely\r\nsuch: and that it is at least a safe medicine in all such cases, in\r\nwhich any practitioner of experience or judgment would ever think\r\nof giving it, is now certainly known. For my own part, I can safely\r\ndeclare, that in near ten years experience of it in Guy’s-Hospital,\r\nduring which time I find I have given it, on different occasions, to\r\nabove five hundred patients in that house only, I never, from the\r\nmost accurate observation I could make, saw it do any harm, or bring\r\non any bad symptom, even in cases where it did not succeed according\r\nto the intention for which it was ordered; and (which I have thought\r\nworth remarking) in chronical cases, even in those, where the bark\r\nhath been by many thought the most prejudicial, when, on the coming on\r\nof an intermittent fever, the bark hath been necessary to cure this\r\nsecondary disease, the original distemper hath gone on, according to\r\nthe best judgment I could form of it, exactly in the same manner, as it\r\nwould have done had the bark never been given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXII. _An Account of an Earthquake felt at_ Lingfield _in_ Surrey,\r\n_and_ Edenbridge _in_ Kent, _on the 24th of_ January 1758. _By_ James\r\nBurrow, _Esq., R. S. V. P._\r\n\r\n[Read April 6, 1758.]\r\n\r\nIN the London Chronicle, Nº. 181, published on the 25th of February\r\n1758, in page 185, is the following article: “We hear, that about\r\ntwo o’clock in the morning of the 24th of last month” (which was the\r\nmonth of January), “an Earthquake was felt in the parishes of Worthe,\r\nand East-Grinsted, in Sussex; Lingfield, in Surrey; and Edenbridge,\r\nin Kent; and other adjacent places: which alarmed several of the\r\ninhabitants very much; but no damage ensued.”\r\n\r\nMr. Burrow, having some connection with these two last parishes of\r\nLingfield and Edenbridge, immediately wrote to the Rev. Mr. Goodricke\r\nof Lingfield, to inquire into the truth of this report: and Mr.\r\nGoodricke’s answer confirmed the fact of its being felt there, and at\r\nother adjacent places; and added, “that it shook the beds and windows,\r\nand made the plates rattle; and went off with a noise, like a small\r\ngust of wind.”\r\n\r\nHowever, Mr. Burrow did not then judge it to be either regular or\r\nproper to trouble the Society with this account; because Mr. Goodricke\r\nonly received it from hearsay and report, he himself happening to be\r\nabsent from Lingfield at that time.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Burrow having passed some days, during the late recess of\r\nthe Society, at a place called Starborough-castle, which lies nearly\r\n_between_ the two churches of Lingfield and Edenbridge (scarce four\r\nmiles distant from each other), he has had an opportunity of being\r\nmore particularly and circumstantially informed of the fact, as far\r\nas relates to those two parishes: and he is now assured, that it was\r\ncertainly and undoubtedly felt and observed by _some_ persons in each\r\nof those two parishes; tho’ (as it happened in the dead of the night,\r\nwhen most people were fast asleep) it was not _generally_ perceived:\r\nnor was it much spoken of, even by those, who were sure they felt it.\r\n\r\nThe persons, from whose own mouths he can authenticate the fact, are\r\nJames Martin, Adam Killick, Mrs. Jewell, and Mr. Chapman: and he has\r\nno less doubt as to Mr. Orgles and Mrs. Pigott (who was waked and much\r\nfrighted by it), tho’ he did not indeed personally converse with either\r\nof the two last.\r\n\r\nThese two, and Mrs. Jewell, all inhabit quite close to Lingfield\r\nchurch-yard, on different sides of it: and Chapman lives within a\r\nquarter of a mile of it, to the south-west.\r\n\r\nJames Martin lives within a bow-shot of Starborough-castle, at the\r\neastern edge of the parish of Lingfield, where it joins to that of\r\nEdenbridge; and Adam Killick’s habitation is three miles north-east of\r\nStarborough, at the north-western point of the parish of Edenbridge.\r\n\r\nAll these four, with whom Mr. Burrow personally conversed, agreed\r\nas to the _time_ of the concussion; _viz._ between one and two in\r\nthe morning: and they all agreed as to the _shaking_ of their beds\r\nand windows; and all of them described the _continuance_ of the\r\nshock as not much more than instantaneous: but they did _not_ all\r\nhear the _noise_, which _some_ of them observed it to conclude with;\r\nparticularly Adam Killick heard NO _noise_ at all; and yet, he says,\r\nhe was broad awake when it first began: and it shook his house and\r\nbed, and made his windows rattle so much, that he was apprehensive of\r\ntheir being broken; and even caused one pane of glass (which was indeed\r\nloose before) actually to drop out. But James Martin, who was likewise\r\nfully awake (as was his wife too), _did hear_ the noise distinctly. He\r\nsays, he felt his house and bed shake, heard his windows rattle, and\r\nsome earthen ware clatter upon a chest of drawers; and also heard a\r\nnoise, like the distant discharge of a cannon: whereupon he immediately\r\nsaid to his wife, “Lord! what is _that_?” but she happening, at that\r\nvery instant, either to cough or sneeze (she cannot recollect which of\r\nthe two), did not, tho’ quite awake, perceive any thing at all of the\r\nmatter. However, she confirmed her husband’s asking her this question\r\nunder an apparent surprize.\r\n\r\nMr. Burrow had a very particular conversation with these two\r\nseparately: and he had also a very minute detail from Adam Killick\r\n(who works for him as a sort of gardener at Starborough); who further\r\nadded, “that the shock waked and frighted his wife, tho’ she was fast\r\nasleep before.”\r\n\r\n6th April, 1758.\r\n\r\n                                                          James Burrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXIII. _An Account of the Case of the First Joint of the Thumb torn\r\noff, with the Flexor Tendon in its whole Extent torn out. By_ Robert\r\nHome, _late Surgeon to the Thirtieth Regiment of Foot, and Surgeon at_\r\nKingston upon Hull. _In a Letter to_ John Pringle, _M. D. F.R.S._\r\n\r\n[Read April 6, 1758.]\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI Take the liberty of inclosing to you a case in surgery, which I\r\nimagine is not very common. Marchetis indeed has an observation of the\r\nsame kind; and there are several others collected together by Mons.\r\nMorand, in the second volume of the Memoires of the Royal Academy\r\nof Surgery at Paris: but as I have not heard of that volume’s being\r\ntranslated into English, and believe there is no observation of a\r\nsimilar nature in the Philosophical Transactions, I beg the favour of\r\nyou to communicate it to the Royal Society, of which you are a Fellow;\r\nand at the same time to make them an offer of the joint of the thumb,\r\nwith its adherent tendon, which you will receive at the same time with\r\nthis; hoping they will do me the honour of accepting it, as a testimony\r\n(tho’ trifling) of my great esteem and respect for the most learned\r\nSociety in Europe. Your Friend Dr. Knox saw the patient dressed oftener\r\nthan once; and Mr. Thornhill, late Surgeon and Manmidwife in Bristol,\r\nsaw it when near healed.\r\n\r\nI beg you will believe me to be, with great truth,\r\n\r\n                                 SIR,\r\n                          Your most obedient,\r\n                       and most humble Servant,\r\n                             Robert Home.\r\n\r\nHull, March 17th, 1758.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAnuary 2d, 1758, William Taylor, 17 years of age, an apprentice to a\r\nwhite-smith in this place, in endeavouring to make his escape from one,\r\nwho was going to correct him, opened the door of a cellar, and threw\r\nhimself into it; but in his hurry so intangled his right thumb with the\r\nlatch, that the whole weight of his body was suspended by it, until it\r\ngave way, and was torn off at the first articulation; the flexor tendon\r\nbeing at the same time pulled out in its whole length, having broke\r\nwhen it became muscular. I was immediately sent for, found little or no\r\nhæmorrhage, and the bone of the second phalanx safe, and covered with\r\nits cartilage, but protruding considerably, occasioned by part of the\r\nskin belonging to it being irregularly torn off with the first joint.\r\n\r\nI was doubtful, whether or not I should be obliged, at last, to make a\r\ncircular incision, and saw the bone even with the skin; but thought it\r\nproper to give him a chance for the use of the whole phalanx.\r\n\r\nHe complained only for the first day of a pretty sharp pain in the\r\ncourse of the tendon; to which compresses, wrung out of warm brandy,\r\nwere applied: but his arm was never swelled; there was no _ecchymosis_;\r\nnor had he so much fever, as to require bleeding even once. The cure\r\nproceeded happily, no symptoms arising from the extracted tendon. At\r\nthe third dressing the bone was covered; and no other application but\r\ndry lint was necessary during the whole time. No exfoliation happened;\r\nyet it was twelve weeks before it was intirely cicatrised, owing to the\r\nloss of skin: and he seems to enjoy the use of the stump as completely,\r\nas if that tendon was not lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXIV. _An Account of the late Discoveries of Antiquities at_\r\nHerculaneum, _and of an Earthquake there; in a Letter from_ Camillo\r\nPaderni, _Keeper of the Museum at_ Herculaneum, _and F.R.S. to_ Tho.\r\nHollis, _Esq; F.R.S. dated_ Portici, Feb. 1. 1758.\r\n\r\n[Read April 6, 1758.]\r\n\r\nWE have been working continually at Herculaneum, Pompeii, and Stabiæ,\r\nsince my last of Dec. 16, 1756. The most remarkable discoveries made\r\nthere are these, which follow.\r\n\r\nFebruary 1757, was found a small and most beautiful figure of a naked\r\nVenus in bronze, the height of which is six Neapolitan inches. She has\r\nsilver eyes, bracelets of gold on her arms, and chains of the same\r\nmetal above her feet; and appears in the attitude of loosening one of\r\nher sandals. The base is of bronze inlaid with foliage of silver, on\r\none side of which is placed a dolphin.\r\n\r\nIn July we met with an inscription, about twelve Neapolitan palms in\r\nlength, which I have here copied.\r\n\r\n                 IMP·CAESAR·VESPASIANVS·AVG·PONTIF·MAX\r\n\r\n           TRIB·POT·̅VĪĪ·IMP·X̅VĪĪ·P·P·COS·̅VĪĪ·DESIGN·̅VĪĪĪ\r\n\r\n          TEMPLVM·MATRIS·DEVM·TERRAE·MOTV·CONLAPSVM·RESTITVIT\r\n\r\nAfter having found a great number of volumes of papirus in Herculaneum;\r\nmany pugillaries, styles, and stands with ink in them, as formerly\r\nmentioned; at length, in the month of August, upon opening a small box,\r\nwe also found, to our exceeding great joy, the instrument, with which\r\nthey used to write their manuscripts. It is made of wood, of an oblong\r\nform, but petrified, and broke into two pieces. There is no slit in it,\r\nthat being unnecessary, as the ancients did not join their letters in\r\nthe manner we do, but wrote them separate.\r\n\r\nIn September were discovered eight marble busts, in the form of terms.\r\nOne of these represents Vitellius, another Archimedes; and both are\r\nof the finest workmanship. The following characters, in a black tint,\r\nare still legible on the latter, namely, ΑΡΧΙΜΕΔ which is all the\r\ninscription that now remains.\r\n\r\nIn October was dug up a curious bust of a young person, who has a\r\nhelmet on his head, adorned with a civic crown, and cheek-pieces\r\nfastened under his chin. Also another very fine bust of a philosopher,\r\nwith a beard, and short thick hair, having a slight drapery on his left\r\nshoulder. Likewise two female busts; one unknown, in a veil; the other\r\nMinerva, with a helmet; both of middling workmanship.\r\n\r\nIn November we met with two busts of philosophers, of excellent\r\nworkmanship, and, as may be easily perceived, of the same artist; but\r\nunfortunately, like many others, without names.\r\n\r\nIn January was found a small, but most beautiful eagle, in bronze.\r\nIt hath silver eyes, perches on a _praefericulum_, and holds a fawn\r\nbetween its talons.\r\n\r\nIn the same month we discovered, at Stabiæ, a term six palms high, on\r\nwhich is a head of Plato, in the finest preservation, and performed in\r\na very masterly manner. Also divers vases, instruments for sacrificing,\r\nscales, balances, weights, and other implements for domestic uses, all\r\nin bronze.\r\n\r\nAt length I have finished, with much labour, the examination and\r\narrangement of the scales, balances, and weights, which are very\r\nnumerous in this museum; and, what is remarkable, many of the former,\r\nwith all the weights, exactly answer those now in use at Naples.\r\nAt present I am considering the liquid measures; and also engaged\r\nin disposing the paintings in the new apartment allotted for them.\r\nThese affairs, with my usual province of inspecting the workmen, who\r\nare busied in digging; my being obliged to keep an exact register of\r\nevery thing, that is discovered; besides other daily and accidental\r\noccurrences; employ my time so intirely, that I have not a moment’s\r\nrepose, but in my bed.\r\n\r\nThe square belonging to the palace, in which the museum is deposited,\r\nwill be finished, and completely ornamented, by Easter. In the center\r\nof it I have placed the bronze horse, which was broken in many pieces,\r\nand restored by me, as mentioned in my last. In the walls of the\r\ncolonades are affixed all the inscriptions hitherto discovered: and I\r\nshall yet adorn them with altars, curule chairs, and other antiquities\r\nproper for such places. The principal entrance into the museum hath\r\nbeen made to correspond with the grand stair-case. On the right side\r\nof it stands the consular statue of Marcus Nonius Balbus, the father;\r\nand on the left, that of Marcus Nonius Balbus, the son; with two\r\ninscriptions relating to, and found near them. Upon the stair-case\r\nare placed eight antique statues in bronze, on beautiful pedestals\r\nof polished marble. In an opening in the center of the right hand\r\ncolonade is fixed the statue of the wife of the elder Balbus, with the\r\nantique inscription belonging to it. At the entrance of the square,\r\na magnificent pair of iron gates, with palisades, are just put up,\r\nornamented with many bronzes, which are gilt; and on the sides of these\r\ngates are two other consular statues of persons unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole day and night of the 24th of last month it seemed as if Mount\r\nVesuvius would again have swallowed up this country. On that day it\r\nsuffered two internal fractures, which intirely changed its appearance\r\nwithin the crater, destroying the little mountain, that had been\r\nforming within it for some years, and was risen above the sides; and\r\nthrowing up, by violent explosions, immense quantities of stones, lava,\r\nashes, and fire. At night the flames burst out with greater vehemence,\r\nthe explosions were more frequent and horrible, and our houses shook\r\ncontinually. Many fled to Naples, and the boldest persons trembled.\r\nFor my own part, I resolved to abide the event here at Portici, on\r\naccount of my family, consisting of eight children, and a very weak\r\nand aged mother, whose life must have been lost by a removal in such\r\ncircumstances, and so rigorous a season. But it pleased God to preserve\r\nus; for the mountain having vented itself that night and the succeeding\r\nday, is since become calm, and throws out only a few ashes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXV. _A further Attempt to facilitate the Resolution of\r\nIsoperimetrical Problems. By Mr._ Thomas Simpson, _F.R.S._\r\n\r\n[Read April 13, 1758.]\r\n\r\nABOUT three years ago I had the honour to lay before the Royal\r\nSociety the investigation of a general rule for the resolution of\r\nisoperimetrical problems of that kind, wherein one, only, of the two\r\nindeterminate quantities enters along with the fluxions, into the\r\nequations expressing the conditions of the problem. Under which kind\r\nare included the determination of the greatest figures under given\r\nbounds, lines of the swiftest descent, solids of the least resistance,\r\nwith innumerable other cases. But altho’ cases of this sort do, indeed,\r\nmost frequently occur, and have therefore been chiefly attended to by\r\nmathematicians, others may nevertheless be proposed, such as actually\r\narise in inquiries into nature, wherein _both_ the flowing quantities,\r\ntogether with their fluxions, are jointly concerned. The investigation\r\nof a _rule_ for the resolution of these, is what I shall in this paper\r\nattempt, by means of the following\r\n\r\nGENERAL PROPOSITION.\r\n\r\n_Let_ Q, R, S, T, &c. _represent any variable quantities, expressed in\r\nterms of_ x _and_ y (_with given coefficients_), _and let_ q, r, s, t,\r\n&c. _denote as many other quantities, expressed in terms of_ ẋ _and_ ẏ;\r\n_It is proposed to find an equation for the relation of_ x _and_ y, _so\r\nthat the fluent of_ Qq + Rr + Ss + Tt, &c. _corresponding to a given\r\nvalue of_ x (_or_ y), _may be a_ maximum _or_ minimum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLet _A E_, _A F_, and _A G_, denote any three values of the quantity\r\n_x_, having indefinitely small _equi-differences E F_, _F G_; and let\r\n_E L_, _F M_, and _G N_, (perpendicular to _A G_) be the respective\r\nvalues of _y_, corresponding thereto; and, supposing _EF_ (= _FG_ =\r\n_ẋ_) to be denoted by _e_, let _c M_ and _d N_ (the successive values\r\nof _ẏ_) be represented by _u_ and _w_. Moreover, supposing _P´p´_\r\nand _P´´p´´_ to be ordinates at the middle points _P´ P´´_, between\r\n_E_, _F_ and _F_, _G_, let the former (_P´p´_) be denoted α, and the\r\nlatter (_P´´p´´_) by β; putting _A P´_ = _a_ and _A P´´_ = _b_. Then,\r\nif _a_ and α (the mean values of _x_ and _y_, between the ordinates\r\n_E L_ and _F M_) be supposed to be substituted for _x_ and _y_, in\r\nthe given quantity _Qq_ + _Rr_ + _Ss_ + _Tt_, _&c._ and if, instead\r\nof _ẋ_ and _ẏ_, their equals _e_ and _u_ be also substituted, and the\r\nsaid (given) quantity, after such substitution, be denoted by _Q´q´_ +\r\n_R´r´_ + _S´s´_ + _T´t´_, _&c._ it is then evident, that this quantity\r\n_Q´q´_ + _R´r´_ + _S´s´_ + _T´t´_, _&c._ will express so much of the\r\nwhole required fluent, as is comprehended between the ordinates _E L_\r\nand _F M_, or as answers to an increase of _E F_ in the value of _x_.\r\nAnd thus, if _b_ and β be conceived to be wrote for _x_ and _y_, _e_\r\nfor _ẋ_, and _w_ for _ẏ_, and the quantity resulting be denoted by\r\n_Q´´q´´_ + _R´´r´´_ + _S´´s´´_ + _T´´t´´_, _&c._ this quantity will,\r\nin like manner, express the part of the required fluent corresponding\r\nto the interval _F G_. Whence that part answering to the interval _E\r\nG_ will consequently be equal to _Q´q´_ + _R´r´ &c._ + _Q´´q´´_ +\r\n_R´´r´´ &c._ But it is manifest, that the whole required fluent cannot\r\nbe a _maximum_ or _minimum_, unless this part, supposing the bounding\r\nordinates _E L_, _G N_ to remain the same, is also a _maximum_ or\r\n_minimum_. Hence, in order to determine the fluxion of this expression\r\n(_Q´q´_ + _R´r´ &c. Q´´q´´_ + _R´´r´´ &c._) which must, of consequence,\r\nbe equal to nothing, let the fluxions of _Q´_ and _q´_ (taking α and\r\n_u_ as variable) be denoted by _̅Q_̇α and _̅qu⋅_; also let _̅R_̇α and\r\n_̅ru⋅_ denote the respective fluxions of _R´_ and _r´_; and let, in\r\nlike manner, the fluxions of _Q´´, q´´, R´´, r´´, &c._ be represented\r\nby _̿Q_̇β, _̿q͘w_, _̿R_͘͘β͘ _̿rẇ_, _&c._ respectively. Then, by the\r\ncommon rule for finding the fluxion of a rectangle, the fluxion of our\r\nwhole expression (_Q´q´_ + _R´r´ &c._ + _Q´´q´´_ + _R´´r´´ &c._) will\r\nbe given equal to _Q´ ̅qu⋅_ + _q´ ̅Q_̇α + _R´ ̅ru⋅_ + _r´ ̅R_̇α _&c._\r\n+ _Q´´̿qẇ_ + _q´´ ̿Q_̇͘͘͘β + _R´´ ̿r͘w_ + _r´´ ̿R_̇β _&c._ = 0.\r\n\r\nBut _u_ + _w_ being = _GN_ - _EL_, and β - α = (_GN_ - _EL_) ⁄ 2 (a\r\nconstant quantity), we therefore have _ẇ_ = -_u͘_, and ̇β = ̇α: also\r\n_u_ being (= 2_rp´_) = 2α - 2_EL_, thence will _u͘_ = 2̇α: which values\r\nbeing substituted above, our equation, after the whole is divided by\r\ṅα, will become\r\n\r\n    2_Q´ ̅q_ + _q´ ̅Q_ + 2_R´ ̅r_ + _r´ ̅R, &c._ - 2_Q´´ ̿q_ + _q´´\r\n    ̿Q_ - 2_R´´ ̿r_ + _r´ ̿R, &c._ = 0;\r\n\r\n    or, _Q´´ ̿q_ - _Q´ ̅q_ + _R´´ ̿r_ - _R´ ̅r &c._ = (_q´ ̅Q_ + _q´´\r\n    ̿Q_) ⁄ 2 + (_r´ ̅R_ + _r´´ ̿R_) ⁄ 2, _&c._\r\n\r\nBut _Q´´ ̿q_ - _Q´ ̅q_, the excess of _Q´´ ̿q_ above _Q´ ̅q_, is\r\nthe increment or fluxion (answering to the increment, or fluxion,\r\n_ẋ_) arising by substituting _b_ for _a_, β for α, and _w_ for _u_.\r\nMoreover, with regard to the quantities on the other side of the\r\nequation, it is plain, seeing the difference of _q´ ̅Q_ and _q´´ ̿Q_\r\nis indefinitely little in comparison of their sum, that _q´ ̅Q_ may be\r\nsubstituted in the room of (_q´ ̅Q_ + _q´´ ̿Q_) ⁄ 2, _&c._ which being\r\ndone, our equation will stand thus:\r\n\r\n  _Flux. Q´ ̅q_ + _R´ ̅r &c._ = _q´ ̅Q_ + _r´ ̅R &c._\r\n\r\nBut _q´ ̅Q_ + _r´ ̅R &c._ represents (by the preceding notation) the\r\nfluxion of _q´Q´_ + _r´R´ &c._ (or of _Qq_ + _Rr &c._) arising by\r\nsubstituting α for _y_, making α alone variable, and casting off ̇α.\r\nIf, therefore, that fluxion be denoted by ̇υ, we shall have _flux. Q´\r\n̅q_ + _R´ ̅r &c._ = ̇υ, and consequently _Q´ ̅q_ + _R´ ̅r &c._ = υ. But\r\n_Q´ ̅q_ + _R´ ̅r &c._ (by the same notation) appears to be the fluxion\r\nof _Q´q´_ + _R´r´ &c._ (or of _Qq_ + _Rr &c._) arising by substituting\r\n_u_ for _ẏ_, making _u_ alone variable, and casting off _̇u_. Whence\r\nthe following\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL RULE.\r\n\r\n_Take the fluxion of the given expression_ (_whose fluent is required\r\nto be a_ maximum _or_ minimum) _making_ ẏ _alone variable; and, having\r\ndivided by_ ÿ, _let the quotient be denoted by_ υ: _Then take, again,\r\nthe fluxion of the same expression, making_ y _alone variable, which\r\ndivide by_ ẏ; _and then this last quotient will be_ = ̇υ.\r\n\r\nWhen _ẏ_ is not found in the quantity given, υ will then be = 0; and,\r\nconsequently, the expression for ̇υ, equal to nothing also. But if\r\n_y_ be absent, then will ̇υ = 0, and consequently the value of υ = a\r\nconstant quantity. It is also easy to comprehend, that, instead of _ẏ_\r\nand _y, ẋ_ and _x_ may be made successively variable. Moreover, should\r\nthe case to be resolved be confined to other restrictions, besides that\r\nof the _maximum_ or _minimum_, such as, having a certain number of\r\nother fluents, at the same time, equal to given quantities, still the\r\nsame method of solution may be applied, and that with equal advantage,\r\nif from the particular expressions exhibiting all the several\r\nconditions, one general expression composed of them all, with unknown\r\n(but determinate) coefficients, be made use of.\r\n\r\nIn order to render this matter quite clear, let _A, B, C, D, &c._ be\r\nsupposed to represent any quantities expressed in terms of _x, y_, and\r\ntheir fluxions, and let it be required to determine the relation of _x_\r\nand _y_, so that the fluent of _Aẋ_ shall be a _maximum_, or _minimum_,\r\nwhen the cotemporary fluents of _Bẋ, Cẋ, Dẋ, &c._ are, all of them,\r\nequal to given quantities.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, in the first place, that the fluent of _Aẋ_ + _bBẋ_\r\n+ _cCẋ_ + _dDẋ, &c._ (_b, c, d, &c._ being any constant quantities\r\nwhatever) must be a _maximum_, or _minimum_, in the proposed\r\ncircumstance: and, if the relation of _x_ and _y_ be determined (_by\r\nthe rule_), so as to answer this single condition (under all possible\r\nvalues of _b, c, d, &c._) it will also appear evident, that such\r\nrelation will likewise answer and include all the other conditions\r\npropounded. For, there being in the general expression, thus derived,\r\nas many unknown quantities _b, c, d, &c._ (to be determined) as there\r\nare equations, by making the fluents of _Bẋ, Cẋ, Dẋ, &c._ equal to the\r\nvalues given; those quantities may be so assigned, or conceived to be\r\nsuch, as to answer all the conditions of the said equations. And then,\r\nto see clearly that the fluent of the first expression, _Aẋ_, cannot\r\nbe greater than arises from hence (other things remaining the same)\r\nlet there be supposed some other different relation of _x_ and _y_,\r\nwhereby the conditions of all the other fluents of _Bẋ, Cẋ, Dẋ, &c._\r\ncan be fulfilled; and let, _if possible_, this new relation give a\r\ngreater fluent of _Aẋ_ than the relation above assigned. Then, because\r\nthe fluents _bBẋ, cCẋ, dDẋ, &c._ are given, and the same in both cases,\r\nit follows, according to this supposition, that this new relation must\r\ngive a greater fluent of _Aẋ_ + _bBẋ_ + _cCẋ_ + _dDẋ, &c._ (under all\r\npossible values of _b, c, d, &c._) than the former relation gives:\r\n_which is impossible_; because (whatever values are assigned to _b,\r\nc, d, &c._) _that_ fluent will, it is demonstrated, be the greatest\r\npossible, when the relation of _x_ and _y_ is that above determined, by\r\nthe General Rule.\r\n\r\nTo exemplify, now, by a particular case, the method of operation above\r\npointed out, let there be proposed the fluxionary quantity (_xⁿ yᵐ\r\nẏᵖ_) ⁄ _ẋ⁽ᵖ ⁻ ¹⁾_; wherein the relation of _x_ and _y_ is so required,\r\nthat the fluent, corresponding to given values of _x_ and _y_, shall\r\nbe a _maximum_, or _minimum_. Here, by taking the fluxion, making _ẏ_\r\nalone variable (_according to the rule_) and dividing by _ÿ_, we shall\r\nhave (_pxⁿ yᵐ ẏ⁽ᵖ ⁻ ¹⁾_) ⁄ _ẋ⁽ᵖ ⁻ ¹⁾_ = υ. And, by taking the fluxion\r\na second time, making _y_ alone variable, and dividing by _ẏ_, will be\r\nhad (_mxⁿ y⁽ᵐ ⁻ ¹⁾ ẏᵖ_) ⁄ _ẋ⁽ᵖ ⁻ ¹⁾_ = ̇υ. Now from these equations to\r\nexterminate υ, let the latter be divided by the former; so shall _mẏ_\r\n⁄ _py_ = ̇υ ⁄ υ; and therefore _ay⁽ᵐ ⁄ ᵖ⁾_ = υ (_a_ being a constant\r\nquantity). From whence _y⁽ᵐ ⁄ ᵖ⁾ẏ_ = _(a ⁄ p)⁽¹ ⁄ ⁽ᵖ ⁻ ¹⁾⁾_ × _ẋx⁽⁻⁽ⁿ ⁄\r\n⁽ᵖ ⁻ ¹⁾⁾⁾_; and consequently (_p_ ⁄ (_m + p_)) × _y⁽⁽ᵐ + ᵖ⁾ ⁄ ᵖ⁾_ = _(a\r\n⁄ p)⁽¹ ⁄ ⁽ᵖ ⁻ ¹⁾⁾_ × (_p_ - 1) ⁄ (_p_ - _n_ - 1) × _x_⁽⁽_ᵖ_ ⁻ _ⁿ_ ⁻ ¹⁾\r\n⁄ ⁽_ᵖ_ ⁻ ¹⁾⁾.\r\n\r\nLet there be now proposed the two fluxions _xⁿyᵐẋ_ and _xᵖy⒬ẏ_, the\r\nfluent of the former being required to be a _maximum_, or _minimum_,\r\nand that of the latter, at the same time, equal to a given quantity.\r\nThen the latter, with the general coefficient _b_ prefixed, being\r\njoined to the former, we shall here have _xⁿyᵐẋ_ + _bxᵖy⒬ẏ_. From\r\nwhence, by proceeding as before, _bxᵖy⒬_ = υ, and _mxⁿy⁽ᵐ ⁻ ¹⁾ẋ_ +\r\n_qbxᵖy⁽ᵖ ⁻¹⁾ẏ_ = ̇υ. From the former of which equations, by taking the\r\nfluxions on both sides, will be had _pbx⁽ᵖ ⁻¹⁾y⒬ẋ_ + _qbxᵖy⁽⒬ ⁻ ¹⁾ẏ_ (=\r\ṅυ) = _mxⁿy⁽ᵐ ⁻ ¹⁾ẋ_ + _qbxᵖy⁽⒬ ⁻ ¹⁾ẏ_. Whence _pbx⁽ᵖ ⁻ ¹⁾y⒬_ = _mxⁿy⁽ᵐ\r\n⁻ ¹⁾_; and therefore _pby⁽⒬ ⁻ ᵐ ⁺ ¹⁾_ = _mx⁽ⁿ ⁻ ᵖ ⁺ ¹⁾_. And in the\r\nsame manner proper equations, to express the relation of _x_ and _y_,\r\nmay be derived, in any other case, and under any number of limitations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXVI. _Observations on the_ Alga Marina latifolia; _The Sea Alga with\r\nbroad Leaves. By_ John Andrew Peyssonel, _M.D. F.R.S. Translated from\r\nthe_ French.\r\n\r\n[Read April 13, 1758.]\r\n\r\nHAVING cast anchor at Verdun, the road at the entrance of the river of\r\nBourdeaux, I was fishing with a kind of drag-net upon a bank of sand,\r\nwhich was very fine and muddy. We collected a number of sea-plants,\r\nand among them the great broad-leaved Alga, which I did not know: and\r\nas the root or pedicle of this plant appeared to be very particular, I\r\nobserved it with attention. The following is its description, and the\r\ndetail of my observations.\r\n\r\nFrom a pedicle, which is sometimes flat, and sometimes round (for they\r\nvary in these plants, and might be about three lines in diameter,\r\nand an inch high, of a blackish colour, and coriaceous substance,\r\napproaching to the nature of the bodies of lithophyta), a single\r\nflat leaf arises, about an inch or an inch and half broad, thick in\r\nits middle to about three lines, ending at the sides in a kind of\r\nedge, like a two-edged sabre, almost like the common Alga, formed of\r\nlongitudinal fibres interlaced with other very delicates ones, and the\r\nwhole filled with a thick juice, like the _parenchyma_ of succulent\r\nplants, such as the Sedum, Aloes, and the like, of a clear yellowish\r\ngreen, and transparent. This first leaf is always single, and serves\r\ninstead of a trunk or stem to the whole plant.\r\n\r\nWhen it rises to about a foot high, more or less, it throws out at the\r\nsides other leaves formed of a continuation of the longitudinal fibres;\r\nand these second leaves are of the same thickness and substance with\r\nthe first: they are two or three feet long, and the whole plant is\r\nfive or six, or more (for one can hardly tell the length); and is not\r\ncapable of supporting itself, but is sustained by the strength of the\r\nwaters, in which it floats.\r\n\r\nThe substance of the plant is not so solid as that of the common Alga,\r\nwhich is capable of drying as it fades, and of being kept: whereas\r\nthe leaves of this great Alga shrink and wither in the air, become\r\nof a blackish colour, and very friable, or indeed soon fall into\r\nputrifaction. I never observed, that they bore any fruit: perhaps this\r\nwas not the season.\r\n\r\nBut what we find particular in this plant is its root or foot: First,\r\nthis pedicle extends in ribs, like what we call the thighs of certain\r\ntrees: these thighs are in right lines: perhaps they run in the same\r\ndirection or situation, that is, placed north and south, or east and\r\nwest; but this I could not observe. They are about three or four\r\nlines high towards the pedicle, and, ending, are lost. They flourish\r\nand spread at the bottom, forming an elliptical bladder, like an egg,\r\nflattened above and below, and rounded at the sides, being intirely\r\nempty: it is rough without, and very smooth within. This egg, or oval\r\nbladder, is exactly round at the ends of the great diameter, but varies\r\na little in the lesser diameter, and forms itself like the body of a\r\nfiddle. The under part is a little flattened; and there is a hole,\r\nwhich is very considerable, in the center of the two diameters. This\r\nhole is about an inch wide, and is quite round: it gives passage to\r\nthe root, or pivot, which I shall by and by mention: the edges appear\r\nto turn a little inward: and it is by this hole that the egg fills\r\nwith sea-water. The whole substance of this bladder or egg is of a\r\ncoriaceous matter, firm and transparent, and of a clear green; nor can\r\nthere be any fibres, either longitudinal or transverse, observed upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe vault at the top, surmounted by the thighs, is as it were\r\ngranulated; but at the rounding of the egg it produces a kind of\r\n_mammæ_, or little elevations, very round and cylindrical, intirely\r\nfull; of the same nature and substance with the egg.\r\n\r\nIn examining the under part of the egg, we found a second rank of these\r\n_mamellæ_, somewhat longer than the first, and at equal distances\r\nfrom one another, in a circular line; then a third yet longer; then a\r\nfourth, which at the extremities were bifurcated; and at last a fifth\r\nrank, which divided into three, and sometimes into five, branches:\r\nthese last, placed round the hole, were wreathed inwards, and several\r\nwere joined together, and only formed a small body; and in wreathing\r\nthemselves thus they close and embrace the pivot mentioned below.\r\nNone of these _mamellæ_ have any apparent opening: their substance is\r\ncompact, of the same nature with the bladder or egg, that produces them.\r\n\r\nBelow the trunk and thighs the plant protrudes a pivot, of a like\r\nsubstance with that of the bladder. This pivot, which is large at its\r\norigin, proceeding thus from the trunk and thighs, forms something like\r\nthe knot of the sea-tree: it descends perpendicularly to the trunk,\r\ndiminishing as it lengthens, and as it grows round; and then divides\r\ninto a number of _mamellæ_, branched and wreathed inwards so firmly, as\r\nnot to be retracted; of a coriaceous nature, blackish, forming a bunch\r\nlike what we call the Rose of Jericho. I cannot recollect the name of\r\nthis plant or flower.\r\n\r\nThis bunch, or wreathed rose, incloses a heap of gravel, as if\r\npetrified or hardened, and ends upon a level with the hole of the egg,\r\nexactly as high as the last rank of _mamellæ_, which wreath upon,\r\nembrace, and sustain it, leaving always an empty space to let the\r\nsea-water pass in, which should fill the inside of the egg or bladder,\r\nand even to let in little fishes and shells.\r\n\r\nI was surprised to find in one little living muscles, as they always\r\nare attached to some solid body by their beards. Now by what means\r\ncould they enter into this egg? I conjectured, that they had their\r\nbeginning there, by the seminal matter of muscles carried in by the\r\nsea-water. I also found some small star-fish, whose rays might be about\r\nfour or five lines long.\r\n\r\nIf my stay here had been longer, I had continued my observations;\r\nand perhaps should have made some discoveries. It belongs to the\r\nacademicians of Bourdeaux to push these observations further, if they\r\nthink proper.\r\n\r\nFrom the Entrance of the river of Bourdeaux, the 4th of August, 1756.\r\n\r\n                                                             Peyssonel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXVII. _An Account of the distilling Water fresh from Sea-water\r\nby Wood-ashes. By Capt._ William Chapman: _In a Letter to_ John\r\nFothergill, _M. D._\r\n\r\n[Read April 13, 1758.]\r\n\r\n                                         Whitby, 10th 2d mo. Feb. 1758.\r\n\r\nTHY kind acceptance of my last emboldens me to inform thee, how, on\r\nmy return from a voyage to the north part of Russia, I procured a\r\nsufficient quantity of fresh water from sea-water, without taking with\r\nme either instruments or ingredients expressly for the purpose.\r\n\r\nSome time in September last, when I had been ten days at sea, by an\r\naccident (off the north cape of Finland) we lost the greatest part of\r\nour water. We had a hard gale of wind at south-west, which continued\r\nthree weeks, and drove us into 73° lat. During this time I was very\r\nuneasy, as knowing, if our passage should hold out long, we must be\r\nreduced to great straits; for we had no rains, but frequent fogs, which\r\nyielded water in very small quantities. I now blamed myself for not\r\nhaving a still along with me (as I had often thought no ship should be\r\nwithout one). But it was now too late; and there was a necessity to\r\ncontrive some means for our preservation.\r\n\r\nI was not a stranger to Appleby’s method: I had also a pamphlet wrote\r\nby Dr. Butler, intituled, _An easy Method of procuring of fresh Water\r\nat Sea_. And I imagined, that soap might supply the place of capital\r\nlees, mentioned by him. I now set myself at work, to contrive a still;\r\nand ordered an old pitch-pot, that held about ten quarts, to be made\r\nclean: my carpenter, by my direction, fitted to it a cover of fir deal,\r\nabout two inches thick, very close; so that it was easily made tight by\r\nluting it with paste. We had a hole thro’ the cover, in which was fixed\r\na wooden pipe nearly perpendicular. This I call the still-head: it was\r\nbored with an augre of 1½ inch diameter, to within three inches of the\r\ntop or extremity, where it was left solid. We made a hole in this,\r\ntowards the upper part of its cavity (with a proper angle) to receive\r\na long wooden pipe, which we fixed therein, to descend to the tub in\r\nwhich the worm should be placed. Here again I was at a loss; for we\r\nhad no lead pipe, nor any sheet-lead, on board. I thought, if I could\r\ncontrive a strait pipe to go thro’ a large cask of cold water, it might\r\nanswer the end of a worm. We then cut a pewter dish, and made a pipe\r\ntwo feet long; and at three or four trials (for we did not let a little\r\ndiscourage us) we made it quite tight. We bored a hole thro’ a cask,\r\nwith a proper descent, in which we fixed the pewter pipe, and made\r\nboth holes in the cask tight, and filled it with sea-water: the pipe\r\nstuck without the cask three inches on each side. Having now got my\r\napparatus in readiness, I put seven quarts of sea-water, and an ounce\r\nof soap, into my pot, and set it on the fire. The cover was kept from\r\nrising by a prop of wood to the bow. We fixed on the head, and into it\r\nthe long wooden pipe above-mentioned, which was wide enough to receive\r\nthe end of the pewter one into its cavity. We easily made the joint\r\ntight.\r\n\r\nI need not tell thee with what anxiety I waited for success: but I\r\nwas soon relieved; for, as soon as the pot boiled, the water began\r\nto run; and in twenty-eight minutes I got a quart of fresh water. I\r\ntried it with an hydrometer I had on board, and found it as light as\r\nriver-water; but it had a rank oily taste, which I imagine was given it\r\nby the soap. This taste diminished considerably in two or three days,\r\nbut not so much as to make it quite palateable. Our sheep and fowls\r\ndrank this water very greedily without any ill effects. We constantly\r\nkept our still at work, and got a gallon of water every two hours;\r\nwhich, if there had been a necessity to drink it, would have been\r\nsufficient for our ship’s crew.\r\n\r\nI now thought of trying to get water more palateable; and often perused\r\nthe pamphlet above-mentioned, especially the quotation from Sir R.\r\nHawkins’s voyage, who “with four billets distilled a hogshead of water\r\nwholsome and nourishing.” I concluded he had delivered this account\r\nunder a veil, lest his method should be discovered: for it is plain,\r\nthat by four billets he could not mean the fuel, as they would scarce\r\n_warm_ a hogshead of water. When, ruminating on this, it came into my\r\nhead, that he burnt his four billets to ashes, and with the mixture\r\nof those ashes with sea-water he distilled a hogshead of fresh water\r\nwholsome and nourishing. Pleased with this discovery, I cut a billet\r\nsmall, and burnt it to ashes; and after cleaning my pot, I put into\r\nit a spoonful of those ashes, with the usual quantity of sea-water.\r\nThe result answered my expectations: the water came off bright and\r\ntransparent, with an agreeable pungent taste, which at first I thought\r\nwas occasioned by the ashes, but afterwards was convinced it received\r\nit from the resin or turpentine in the pot, or pipes annexed to it.\r\nI was now relieved from my fears of being distressed thro’ want of\r\nwater; yet thought it necessary to advise my people not to be too free\r\nin the use of this, whilst we had any of our old stock remaining; and\r\ntold them, I would make the experiment first myself; which I did, by\r\ndrinking a few glasses every day without any ill effect whatever. This\r\nwater was equally light with the other, and lathered very well with\r\nsoap. We had expended our old stock of water before we reached England;\r\nbut had reserved a good quantity of that which we distilled. After my\r\narrival at Shields, I invited several of my acquaintance on board to\r\ntaste the water: they drank several glasses, and thought it nothing\r\ninferior to spring-water. I made them a bowl of punch of it, which was\r\nhighly commended.\r\n\r\nI have not the convenience of a still here, or should have repeated the\r\nexperiment for the conviction of some of my friends: for as to myself,\r\nI am firmly persuaded, that wood-ashes mixed with sea-water will yield,\r\nwhen distilled, as good fresh water as can be wished for. And I think,\r\nif every ship bound a long voyage was to take a small still with Dr.\r\nHales’s improvements, they need never want fresh water. Wood-ashes\r\nmay easily be made, whilst there is any wood in the ship; and the\r\nextraordinary expence of fuel will be trifling, if they contrive so\r\nthat the still may stand on the fire along with the ship’s boiler.\r\n\r\nI shall think myself sufficiently recompensed, if any hints here may\r\ntend to the relief of my brother sailors from the dismal extremity of\r\nwant of water; an extremity too little regarded by those, who have\r\nnever experienced it.\r\n\r\n  _P. S._ During my passage from Russia we very rarely had any _aurora\r\n  borealis_; and those few we saw were faint, and of short continuance:\r\n  at which I was much surprised; for about ten years ago, being in a\r\n  high north latitude, we had very beautiful ones almost every night in\r\n  the month of September; which exceeded any I have seen described in\r\n  the _Philosophical Transactions_, or _Memoires de l’Academie Royale_.\r\n\r\n                                                           Wm.

By_ John Andrew\r\nPeyssonel, _M. D. F.R.S. Translated from the_ French.\r\n\r\n[Read April. 20, 1758.]\r\n\r\nI Went to make my observations upon the natural history of the sea;\r\nand when I arrived at a place called the Cauldrons of Lance Caraibe,\r\nnear Lancebertrand, a part of the island of Grande Terre Guadaloupe,\r\nin which place the coast runs north-east and south-west, the sea being\r\nmuch agitated that day flowed from the north-west. There the coast is\r\nfurnished with hollow rocks, and vaults underneath, with chinks and\r\ncrevices: and the sea, pushed into these deep caverns by the force\r\nand agitation of the waves, compresses the air, which, recovering its\r\nspring, forces the water back in the form of the most magnificent\r\nfountains; which cease, and begin again at every great pressure. This\r\nphænomenon is common to many places in this island. The explanation of\r\nit is easy; but the following is what I particularly observed.\r\n\r\nAs I walked within about forty paces from the brink of the sea, where\r\nthe waves broke, I perceived, in one place, the plants were much\r\nagitated by some cause, that was not yet apparent. I drew near, and\r\ndiscovered a hole about six feet deep, and half a foot diameter;\r\nand stopping to consider it, I perceived the earth tremble under my\r\nfeet. This increased my attention; and I heard a dull kind of noise\r\nunderground, like that which precedes common earthquakes; which I have\r\nobserved many a time. It was followed by a quivering of the earth; and\r\nafter this a wind issued out of the hole, which agitated the plants\r\nround about. I watched to see whether the motion extended to any\r\ndistance; but was sensible it did not reach above three or four paces\r\nfrom the hole, and that no motion was perceived farther off.\r\n\r\nI further observed, that this phænomenon never happens till after the\r\nseventh wave rolls in; for it is a common thing in this country to find\r\nthe sea appear calm for some time, and then to produce seven waves,\r\nwhich break upon the coast one after another: the first is not very\r\nconsiderable; the second is somewhat stronger; and thus they go on\r\nincreasing to the seventh, after which the sea grows calm again, and\r\nretires. This phænomenon of the seven waves is observed by navigators\r\nwith great attention, especially at low water, in order to be the\r\nbetter able to go in or come out at the very time that the sea grows\r\nquiet. These seven waves successively fill the caverns, which are all\r\nalong the coast; and when the seventh comes to open itself, the air\r\nat the bottom of the caverns being greatly compressed, acted by its\r\nelasticity, and immediately made those fountains and gushings I have\r\nmentioned; and the waters continuing in the caverns, up to the very\r\nplace of the hole, began to produce that dull noise, caused the emotion\r\nor earthquake, and finished with the violent wind forced up thro’ the\r\nhole; after which the water retired into the sea, and having no further\r\nimpelling cause, on account of the waves, rendered every thing quiet\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nI observed, that this phænomenon happened at no limited time, but\r\naccording to the approach of the waves, being strongly put in motion\r\nafter the seventh. I remained near half an hour to observe it; and\r\nnearly followed the course of the cavern to its entrance, directed by\r\nthe disposition of the coast. I made my negroes go down where the water\r\nbroke; for they doubted the report of the greatness of these caverns;\r\nand when the sea was calm one of them ventured in, but returned very\r\nquickly, or he must have perished. Therefore I conclude, that these\r\nsmall earthquakes round the hole, about forty paces from the wave, were\r\nonly caused by the compressed air in some great vault about this place,\r\nand that by its force was driven up the hole that appeared: that this\r\nair in the caverns, compressed to a certain degree, first caused the\r\ndull noise, by the rolling of the waters, which resisted in the cavern;\r\nthen acting more violently, caused the small earthquake, which ceased\r\nwhen the wind passed out of the hole, and that the sea retired, and\r\ngave liberty to the air, which was contained and compressed.\r\n\r\nSuch are the observations I have made; from which the learned, who are\r\nendeavouring to find the cause of earthquakes, since that dreadful one,\r\nwhich destroyed the city of Lisbon, may make such conclusions as they\r\nshall think proper.\r\n\r\nAt Guadaloupe, Jan. 6. 1757.\r\n\r\n                                                             Peyssonel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXC. _A Catalogue of the_ Fifty Plants _from_ Chelsea Garden, _presented\r\nto the_ Royal Society _by the worshipful Company of Apothecaries, for\r\nthe Year 1757, pursuant to the Direction of Sir_ Hans Sloane, _Baronet,\r\nMed.

Communicated by_ Wm.\r\nWatson, _M. D. F.R.S._\r\n\r\n  ----_Natura nihil frustra creaverit, posteros tamen tot inventuros\r\n  utilitates ex_ Muscis _auguror, quot ex reliquis vegetabilibus_.\r\n\r\n  Cui bono? Amæn. Acad. III. p. 241.\r\n\r\n[Read Apr. 27 & May 4, 1758.]\r\n\r\nTHE whole class of mosses were taken but very little notice of by\r\nthe revivers of botany in the sixteenth century: they indeed took\r\nsome pains to distinguish the particular species that the ancients\r\nhad mentioned, but disregarded almost all the rest. Modern botanists\r\nhowever suppose, that they were but little successful in general in\r\ntheir application of the ancient names to plants: nor is a failure in\r\nsuch attempts to be wondered at, considering the too great conciseness,\r\nand frequent obscurity, of their descriptions. In the class of mosses,\r\nas in many others, the accounts transmitted to us are little more than\r\na scene of uncertainty and confusion.\r\n\r\nIt is to the moderns we are indebted for the discovery of the far\r\ngreater number of the plants of this class. In this branch of\r\nbotany our own countrymen Mr. Ray, Buddle, Dale, Doody, Petiver, and\r\nDr. Morison, Sherard, Richardson, and others, have distinguished\r\nthemselves: and amongst foreigners M. Vaillant, Sig. Micheli, and\r\nthe very eminent Dr. Haller: but, beyond all, the late learned and\r\nindefatigable professor at Oxford, Dr. Dillenius, has herein made the\r\nmost ample discoveries and improvements, of which his elaborate history\r\nwill ever remain a standing proof.\r\n\r\nThe word _lichen_ occurs in the writings of Dioscorides and Pliny;\r\nand tho’ it may be doubtful, there is nevertheless good reason to\r\napprehend, that Dioscorides meant to describe under that name the very\r\nplant, or at least one of the same genus, to which the commentators\r\nagreed to affix his description. Since then the name has been variously\r\napplied by different authors; on which account it is necessary to\r\npremise, that the _lichen sive hepatica Off._ or liverwort of the\r\nshops, does not fall under this generical term, as it is now formed by\r\nthe three above-named authors. They comprehend under the term _Lichen_,\r\nand Dillenius under those of _Usnea_, _Coralloides_, and _Lichenoides_,\r\nthe hairy tree-moss or _usnea_ of the shops; the _muscus pulmonarius_,\r\ntree-lungwort, or oak-lungs; the _lichen terrestris cinereus_, or\r\nash-coloured ground liverwort; the coralline-mosses; the cup-mosses;\r\nhorned mosses; the _orchel_, or Canary-weed; the _muscus islandicus_ of\r\nBartholine; and a multitude of others found upon trees, walls, rocks,\r\nand stones, in all parts of the world, and in many parts thereof in\r\nvery great abundance.\r\n\r\nCaspar Bauhine in his _Pinax_, John Bauhine, and countrymen Gerard\r\nand Parkinson, and their cotemporaries, as they wrote before the time\r\nthat generical characters in botany were in use, included these lichens\r\namong the other herbaceous mosses, under the general name of _muscus_;\r\nadding to the name in general some epithet descriptive of its form,\r\nplace of growth, or supposed virtue.\r\n\r\nMr. Ray, both in his History of Plants, and in the Supplement, as\r\nhe was usually averse to the forming of new names, has interspersed\r\nthem among other mosses, under the character of _musci steriles seu\r\naspermi_, retaining the synonyms of the two Bauhines, Gerard, and\r\nParkinson, to the general species.\r\n\r\nDr. Morison seems to have been the first, who separated them intirely\r\nfrom the herbaceous mosses; and, from the analogy he supposed they had\r\nwith the fungus tribe, formed them into a genus, under the name of\r\n_musco-fungus_. He enumerates fifty species and upwards under this term\r\nin the _Historia Oxoniensis_, and has divided them into five orders,\r\naccording to their different appearances, as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. _Musco-fungi e terra prominentes, latiores._ 5.\r\n  2. _Musco-fungi pixidati._ 11.\r\n  3. _Musco-fungi corniculati._ 26.\r\n  4. _Musco-fungi crustæ modo adnascentes._ 37.\r\n  5. _Musco-fungi corticibus arborum dependentes._ 53.\r\n\r\nTable the 7th of his 15th section exhibits several good figures of some\r\nof these lichens.\r\n\r\nTournefort was the first, who adapted the generical term _lichen_ to\r\nthem; but it was in consequence of his joining them to the lichen\r\nof the shops. He has however excluded the coralline-mosses, and\r\nforms them into a genus, by the name of _coralloides_; to which he\r\nhas connected some plants, properly of the fungus tribe. In this\r\ndistinction he is followed by Dr. Boerhaave in his _Index alter\r\nPlantarum_.\r\n\r\nDr. Dillenius first called them _lichenoides_, in the catalogue of\r\nplants growing about Giessen, chusing to retain the word _lichen_ to\r\nthe liverwort of the shops. Under this name however, in this work, he\r\ndoes not comprehend the _usneæ_, or hairy tree-mosses, but refers them\r\nto the _conservæ_, adding the epithet _arborea_ to each species, to\r\ndistinguish them from the water kinds. He enumerates upwards of sixty\r\nspecies of _lichenoides_, but has applied few or no synonyms to them.\r\n\r\nUnder the same generic term he has introduced them into the third\r\nedition of Ray’s Synopsis of British Plants, taking in the _usneæ_, and\r\nrecounting upwards of ninety species, all found spontaneously growing\r\nin England. Many of these are undoubtedly only varieties. They are in\r\nthis work very naturally divided into several orders and subdivisions,\r\nfor the greater ease of distinguishing them, as follows:\r\n\r\n_Lichenoides_\r\n\r\n  _caulifera_\r\n    1. _Capillacea et non tubulosa scutellata._\r\n    2. _Coralliformia tuberculosa plerumque._\r\n      a. _Solida et non tubulosa._\r\n      b. _Tubulosa._\r\n    3. _Pyxidata._\r\n    4. _Fungiformia._\r\n\r\n  _cauliculis destituta_\r\n    1. _Mere crustacea._\r\n    2. _Crusta foliosa scutellata seu foliis scutellatis arcte\r\n    adnascentibus_ -\r\n      a. _Substantiæ gelatinosæ._\r\n      b. _Substantiæ durioris._\r\n    3. _Foliis magis liberis nec tam arcte adnascentibus_\r\n      a. _Scutellatis et tuberculatis._\r\n      b. _Peltatis._\r\n\r\nM. Vaillant, in the _Botanicon Parisiense_, retains Tournefort’s\r\nnames. Many of these lichens, as well as other mosses, are accurately\r\nrepresented in the elegant tables, which adorn that work. Dr. Haller\r\ntells us he learnt to distinguish almost all the mosses solely by the\r\nhelp of these tables, so well are they expressed. The lovers of botanic\r\nscience are greatly indebted to Boerhaave for his publication of that\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nMicheli, after Tournefort, adopts the term _lichen_, and comprehends\r\nall the species under it, except one or two, which he calls\r\n_lichenoides_. This author however does not take into this genus the\r\nliverwort of the _materia medica_; he describes the species of that\r\ngenus under the name of _marchantiæ_. Near twenty of the plates in his\r\n_Nova Plantarum Genera_ are taken up in representing various species\r\nof this genus. In this work they are divided into thirty-eight orders\r\nor subdivisions; a circumstance very necessary indeed, considering\r\nhow greatly he has multiplied the number of the species. It is to\r\nbe regretted, that so indefatigable an author, one whose genius\r\nparticularly led him to scrutinize the minuter subjects of the science,\r\nshould have been so solicitous to increase the number of species under\r\nall his genera: an error this, which tends to great confusion and\r\nembarassment, and must retard the progress and real improvement of the\r\nbotanic science.\r\n\r\nDr. Haller retains Micheli’s term, and enumerates 160 kinds in his\r\n_Enumeratio Stirpium Helvetiæ_: he divides them into seven orders,\r\naccording to the following titles:\r\n\r\n  1. _Lichenes corniculati & pixidati._\r\n  2. _Lichenes coralloidei._\r\n  3. _Lichenes fruticosi alii._\r\n  4. _Lichenes pulmonarii._\r\n  5. _Lichenes crustacei scutis floralibus ornati._\r\n  6. _Lichenes scutellis ornati._\r\n  7. _Lichenes crustacei non scutati._\r\n\r\nThe extensive number of the species, and the difficulty of\r\ndistinguishing them with a tolerable degree of certainty, has deterred\r\nDr. Haller from adding so full and complete a list of synonyms to the\r\nplants of this genus as he has elsewhere done in that splendid work.\r\nPlate the 2d exhibits several elegant sorts of these lichens.\r\n\r\nLinnæus, and the followers of his method, who seem to have established\r\ntheir generical character from Micheli’s discoveries, retain also his\r\ngenerical title. Micheli’s passion for the multiplication of species\r\nis no-where more conspicuous than in the plants of this genus, which\r\nhe has most enormously augmented to the number of 298 species. The\r\nSwedish professor cannot be charged with this foible: it is one of the\r\nexcellencies of his writings, that they inculcate the reverse. He has\r\nso far retrenched this genus, that in his general enumeration of plants\r\nhe recounts only eighty species belonging to it. They are in this work\r\ndivided into eight orders, according to the difference of appearance\r\nwhich they form by their _facies externa_, little or no regard being\r\nhad to what are usually called the parts of fructification.\r\n\r\n  1. _Lichenes leprosi tuberculati._\r\n  2. _Lichenes leprosi scutellati._\r\n  3. _Lichenes imbricati._\r\n  4. _Lichenes foliacei._\r\n  5. _Lichenes coriacei._\r\n  6. _Lichenes scyphiferi._\r\n  7. _Lichenes fructiculosi._\r\n  8. _Lichenes filamentosi._\r\n\r\nDr. Dillenius, in his most elaborate work, intituled, _Historia\r\nMuscorum_, has divided this Michelian genus into three, under the names\r\nof _usnea_, _coralloides_, and _lichenoides_. Under the word _usnea_\r\nhe comprehends the hairy tree-mosses, among which are the _usnea_ of\r\nthe shops, and the true _usnea_ of the Arabians. Of these he describes\r\nsixteen species. Under _coralloides_ he describes thirty-nine species,\r\namong which are the cup-mosses, and many others, disposed according to\r\nthe following scheme:\r\n\r\nOrdo I. _Fungiformia, non tubulosa, nec ramosa._ 5.\r\n\r\nOrdo II. _Scyphiformia, tubulosa, simplicia et prolifera._\r\n\r\n  Series 1. _Scyphis perfectioribus._ 13. Cup-mosses.\r\n  Series 2. _Scyphis imperfectis._ 20. Horned mosses.\r\n\r\nOrdo III. _Ramosa fruticuli specie summitatibus acutis multifariam\r\ndivisis._\r\n\r\n  Series 1. _Species tubulosæ._ 30. Tubulous coralline mosses.\r\n  Series 2. _Species solidæ._ 39. Solid coralline mosses; among which is\r\n    the _orchel_.\r\n\r\nThe genus of _lichenoides_ contains 135 species, disposed according to\r\nthe following scheme:\r\n\r\n  Ordo I. _Species aphyllæ mere crustaceæ._ {1. _Tuberculosæ._ 8.\r\n                                            {2. _Scutellatæ._ 18.\r\n\r\n                              {1. _Gelatinosæ tuberculosæ et\r\n                                   scutellatæ._ 35.\r\n  Ordo II. _Species foliosæ._ {2. _Aridiores et exsuccæ,\r\n                                   scutellatæ._ 100.\r\n                              {3. _Aridiores peltatæ et clypeatæ._ 121.\r\n\r\nThese plants are not only largely described, and accompanied with the\r\nmost perfect assemblage of synonyms; but every species is accurately\r\nfigured, and many of them in various views, and at different ages of\r\ntheir growth; by which this laborious work, notwithstanding it is\r\nconversant upon the minutest, and consequently the most abstruse\r\nparts of botany, may nevertheless be justly esteemed, without any\r\nexaggeration, one of the most complete works extant of the kind.\r\n\r\nDr. Hill, in his History of Plants, has disposed them into five\r\ngenera, under the following names: 1. _Usnea_, comprehending the hairy\r\ntree-mosses; 2. _Platysma_, flat-branched tree-mosses, the lungwort,\r\nand others; 3. _Cladonia_, containing the orchel and coralline-mosses;\r\n4. _Pyxidium_, the cup-mosses; 5. _Placodium_, the crustaceous mosses.\r\n\r\nThe plants of this extensive genus are very different in their form,\r\nmanner of growing, and general appearance: on which account those\r\nauthors, who preserve them under the same name, saw the propriety and\r\nnecessity of arranging them into different orders and subdivisions,\r\nthat the species might be distinguished with greater facility. Upon the\r\nsame principle Dr. Dillenius and Dr. Hill have formed them into several\r\ngenera.\r\n\r\nSo far as the parts of fructification are distinguishable in these\r\nplants, they appear in different forms upon different species: on some,\r\nin the form of tubercles; on others, in the form of little concave\r\ndishes, called _scutellæ_; on others, of oblong flat shields or pelts.\r\nAll these are conceived by Micheli and Linnæus to be receptacles of\r\nmale flowers. The female flowers and seeds are suspected by the same\r\nauthors to be dispersed in the form of farina or dust upon the same\r\nplants, and in some instances on separate ones. Dillenius has not\r\ndared to determine any thing positively with regard to the real parts\r\nof fructification in these lichens: time will hereafter, it is to be\r\nhoped, throw more light upon the subject.\r\n\r\nIn order to convey a more distinct idea of the several plants of this\r\ngenus, which enter into œconomical or medical uses in the various parts\r\nof the world, we shall distribute them into several orders, according\r\nto the custom of former writers: and as is not consistent with our plan\r\nto describe each of these species, we shall refer to the page of the\r\nmore modern authors, where they may be found.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Lichenes filamentosi.\r\n\r\n_Such as consist of mere solid filaments, of a firm and solid but\r\nflexible texture, having the appearance of fructification in the\r\nform of_ scutellæ, _or flat round bodies growing from the sides or\r\nextremities of these filaments_.\r\n\r\nThis order or division comprehends the hairy tree-mosses, or _usnea_\r\nof Dillenius and Hill; several of the species of the fifth order of\r\nlichens of Micheli; and the _lichenes filamentosi_ of Linnæus.\r\n\r\nDr. Dillenius describes sixteen species under the term _usnea_, several\r\nof which are found in England, tho’ some of them, as the common _usnea_\r\nof the shops, but very sparingly, and none of them in any considerable\r\nplenty. The thick woods in many other parts of Europe, and the rest of\r\nthe globe, afford them in great plenty. They hang from the branches of\r\nvarious kinds of trees, like large tufts of hair, to a considerable\r\nlength: some species grow several feet long. The rocks on the tops\r\nof high mountains afford several kinds. They are of various colours;\r\nsome whitish, ash-coloured, others grey or blackish, and two or three\r\nspecies have a yellow or orange hue.\r\n\r\nThe commentators in general agreed in making the _bryon_ of[65]\r\nDioscorides one of these hairy tree-mosses, which they called _usnea_.\r\nNo wonder, therefore, that at the restoration of letters it became a\r\nmatter of controversy, which of them was the _usnea_ of the ancients.\r\nDioscorides recommends his as an astringent; and tells us, that\r\n“the best grew upon the cedar; but that from whatever tree it was\r\ngathered, the whitest and most fragrant was preferable to the black.”\r\nThe several _usneæ_ would undoubtedly in different countries be found\r\nupon different trees. In Italy, that of the larch-tree was the most\r\nodoriferous; and on that account Matthiolus[66] preferred it to all\r\nothers. That kind, which at length obtained a place in the shops as the\r\n_usnea_ of the ancients, was a species commonly found in our countries\r\non old oaks and other trees, and is called by Dillenius[67] stringy\r\ntree-moss, or _usnea_ of the shops. Many excellent virtues have been\r\nascribed to it, on a supposition of its being the true _usnea_; but it\r\ndoes not appear to have deserved them: and the present practice, at\r\nleast in England, has quite expunged it, and that perhaps very justly.\r\n\r\nDr. Dillenius is evidently of opinion however, that this common\r\n_usnea_, tho’ it obtained a place in the shops as such, is not the\r\n_bryon_ of Dioscorides and Pliny, or the _phaseon_ of Theophrastus,\r\nsince he has applied these names from those fathers of botany to\r\nanother species, which he calls the _beard usnea_[68]. Nor does either\r\nof these species appear to be the true _usnea_ of the Arabians,\r\nwhatever title they may seem to have to it, either from their colour\r\nor smell. Bellonius, as he is quoted by Dr. Dillenius, tells us, “that\r\nthe true _usnea_, or _bryon_, as he calls it, is sold at Constantinople\r\nunder the name of _usnech_; and tells us we are deceived in believing\r\nours to be the true _usnea_.” Dillenius has therefore described another\r\nspecies[69], which he received from the East Indies, from Madagascar,\r\nand St. Helen’s, as the _Usnea Arabum_. This plant the Indians call\r\n_saliaga_; and Camelli assures us, that, while fresh, it has a very\r\nfragrant musk-smell. He adds, that he had himself experienced what\r\nSerapio says of it; _viz._ that a vinous infusion of it restrains\r\nfluxes, stops vomiting, strengthens the stomach, and induces sleep.\r\n\r\nThe common _usnea_ of the shops was said to be the basis of that fine\r\nperfumed powder, which the French called _corps de cypre gris_, and\r\nwhich formerly made a great article of trade at Montpelier. Dr. Brown\r\nhints[70], that the perfumers use it still; but he does not add, where.\r\nJohn Bauhine gives us the whole process[71] for making that power,\r\nwhich was vended in great quantities to all parts of France. It is\r\nnevertheless true, that other of the lichens had as great a share in\r\nthe competition as the _usnea_; as the demand for that powder could\r\nnot have been answered, if the makers had confined themselves to the\r\n_usnea_ alone. It was necessary too, inasmuch as other species are\r\nequally well adapted to the same uses[72].\r\n\r\nThis _usnea_ is abundantly plentiful in the woods of Lapland; and\r\nLinnæus[73] relates, that the inhabitants apply it to their feet,\r\nwhen they are sore and excoriated with much walking. The benefit they\r\nreceive from it in this case is undoubtedly owing to its styptic\r\nquality, which is remarked by Matthiolus, and by Mr. Ray[74] from the\r\nGerman Ephemerides.\r\n\r\nThe _beard usnea_ before mentioned, which is abundantly common upon\r\nthe trees both in the northern regions of Europe and America, as well\r\nas in the eastern kingdoms, and is described by Mr. Ray as hanging\r\nto the length of two feet, the filaments of which are not thicker\r\nthan a common thread, and of a greenish white colour, is used by\r\nthe inhabitants of Pensylvania to dye an orange colour with. This\r\ninformation Dillenius received from Mr. Bartram.\r\n\r\nThe black _mane usnea_, which grows in vast quantities in the Lapland\r\nwoods, in a defect of the common coralline moss makes part of the\r\nfodder, and is equally acceptable to the rein-deer in the winter\r\ntime[75].\r\n\r\nThe long beaded _usnea_, or necklace-moss[76], enters into the\r\nlike œconomical uses in Virginia, where it is very plentiful. The\r\ninhabitants find it a very agreeable fodder in the winter season to\r\nboth sheep and cows[77].\r\n\r\nThe Norwegians appropriate one of these _usnea_ to a singular use.\r\nPontoppidan tells us[78], “they have a certain kind of yellow moss\r\nhanging on the branches of trees of the firs and pines, which is very\r\nvenomous, yet applied to a necessary use; for being mixed in pottage,\r\nor with flesh, as a bait for the wolves, they infallibly die of it.”\r\nThat the species here referred to is the brass-wired _usnea_ of\r\nDillenius[79], or the _lichen vulpinus_ of Linnæus, cannot be doubted,\r\nsince this last author mentions[80] the same application of it with\r\nvery little variation. In England it is very rare; in Sweden plentiful,\r\nespecially in the province of Smoland, where the natives dye woollen\r\ngoods yellow with it.\r\n\r\nJohn Bauhine describes a very beautiful species, under the name of\r\n_laricus muscus_[81], which gives a very elegant citron colour upon\r\nchewing, or upon maceration in water. Dillenius is doubtful, whether\r\nthis is what he has described under the name of the orange-coloured\r\nforked _usnea_[82].\r\n\r\nWe may here observe by the bye, that the _usnea cranii humani_, which\r\nthro’ the influence of superstition formerly obtained a place in the\r\ncatalogues of the _materia medica_, does not belong to this division\r\nof the lichens. The writers of those times distinguished two kinds of\r\n_usnea humana_, under the names of _crustacea_ and _villosa_. Any of\r\nthe crustaceous lichens, but more properly the common grey-blue pitted\r\n_lichenoides_ of Dillenius, was used for the former of these; and, as\r\nDale tells us, was held in most esteem. The _villosa_ was a species of\r\nthe genus of _hypnum_. Indeed it does not appear, that they were in\r\nthose days very curious in determining the exact kind; and doubtless\r\nany moss, which happened to grow upon an human skull, was sufficient\r\nfor the purposes designed.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Lichenes fruticulosi.\r\n\r\n_Such as consist of a tough flexible matter, formed into ramifications,\r\nin some species almost simple, in others resembling small shrubs: in\r\nsome of the species the branches are quite solid, in others tubular._\r\n\r\nThis order comprehends the third of Dillenius’s genus of _coralloides_;\r\nthe whole _cladonia_ of Hill; the second, and several species of the\r\nthird order of Haller’s lichens; several species of the fifth, and\r\nthe whole sixth, order of Micheli; and the _lichenes fruticulosi_ of\r\nLinnæus.\r\n\r\nThe plants of this genus grow principally upon the ground on heaths,\r\nforests, and mountainous barren places; except the _orcelle_, or\r\nCanary-weed, which is found upon the rocks on the sea-coast.\r\n\r\nTo this division belongs the horned moss[83]. It is found with us in\r\nrocky barren ground, and upon old walls not uncommon. It was formerly\r\nin great credit as a pectoral; but is now quite in disrepute.\r\n\r\nThe common branched coralline-moss[84] is one of the most useful\r\nplants of all the tribe of lichens. It is pretty frequent with us on\r\nour heaths, forests, and mountains. The northern regions afford it in\r\nabundance; and there it is peculiarly and singularly useful. It is\r\nindeed the very support and foundation of all the Lapland œconomy, and\r\nwithout which the inhabitants could not sustain their rein-deer in the\r\nwinter time. Linnæus tells us[85], that Lapland affords no vegetables\r\nin such plenty as this, and other of the lichens. Plains of several\r\nmiles extent are totally covered over with it, as if with snow; and\r\nwhere no other plant will even take root, this will thrive and be\r\nluxuriant. These dreary and inclement wastes, these _terræ damnatæ_,\r\nas a foreigner would readily call them; these, are the Lapland fields\r\nand fertile pastures. On this lichen the rein-deer, those sources of\r\nall their wealth, feed in the winter time, when it is in its most\r\nflourishing condition, and no other vegetable is to be had: with this\r\ntoo they will even become fat. The riches of the Laplanders consist in\r\ntheir number of these cattle: they are cloathed with their skins, fed\r\nwith their flesh, and from their milk they make both butter and cheese.\r\nNature, by the inclemency of their seasons, has almost denied them\r\nthe cultivation of their earth: they neither sow nor reap; but live a\r\nperpetual migratory life, tending their flocks of rein-deer, upon which\r\ntheir whole care is centered and employed.\r\n\r\nThe milk of the rein-deer is very remarkably fat and rich: it tastes\r\nindeed like cow’s milk, with which some butter, and a small quantity of\r\nfat or suet, has been intimately united. Dr. Haller[86] suspects, that\r\nthis richness of the milk is owing to the animals feeding upon this\r\nmoss. Most of the plants of this family are of an astringent quality,\r\nwhich indeed they manifest to the taste. This astringency of their food\r\nwill doubtless contribute much to that effect.\r\n\r\nThe rein-deer are not the only animals that will feed upon the\r\ncoralline moss. The Novaccolæ[87] gather vast quantities of it to\r\nfodder their oxen with in the winter. They take the opportunity of\r\nraking it together in the rainy seasons, when it is tough; for in dry\r\nweather it easily crumbles into powder. This they moisten with a little\r\nwater in the winter season when they use it, and find it excellent\r\nfodder.\r\n\r\nThe coralline mosses are subject to great variation: and altho’ there\r\nare several really distinct species, yet they run so into one another,\r\nthat it is no easy matter to fix upon the real specific distinctions,\r\nin many instances. Some species are perfectly white; others have the\r\nextremities of the branches reddish, some brown, and others almost\r\nblack. The common coralline moss in Lapland not unfrequently grows to\r\nbe several inches long, and even a foot high.\r\n\r\nThe tubular or hollow branched coralline mosses are not the only\r\nkinds upon which the rein-deer will feed. Almost all the lichens\r\nare abundantly more plentiful in those northern, than in these more\r\nsoutherly climates. There are several species with solid branches; one,\r\nwhich Dillenius calls _The crisp warty Alpine coralloides_[88], which\r\nis almost as plentiful as the common sort, and is equally acceptable\r\nto those animals[89]. It was before observed, that, in defect of these\r\nmosses, the black _mane usnea_ is a substitute equally acceptable to\r\nthose animals.\r\n\r\nAnother of the most remarkable and useful plants of this division\r\nis the _orchel_[90], or _argol_, as it is commonly called. This\r\nenters more into œconomical uses among us than any other of the whole\r\ngenus. How considerable an article it forms in the dying trade, in\r\nwhich its uses are various and extensive, is very well known. Its\r\ntinging property has been known from ancient times; and some of our\r\nmost celebrated botanic writers are of opinion, that it was used as a\r\ndye even in the days of Theophrastus. That father of botany mentions\r\na _fucus_, which, he says, grew upon the rocks about the island of\r\nCrete; and that they dyed woollen garments of a purple, or rather a red\r\ncolour, with it. It grows on the rocks by the sea-coast in many parts\r\nof the Archipelago, and in the Canary Islands; from whence we generally\r\nimport it, as well as from the Cape Verd, which afford it in plenty.\r\nThe demand for _orchel_ is so great, that Mr. Hellot[91], of the Royal\r\nAcademy of Sciences, informs us, they gather yearly, upon an average,\r\nfrom the isle of Teneriffe 500 quintals, which amounts to 25 ton\r\nweight; from the Canary Islands 400 quintals, from Forteventura 300,\r\nfrom Lancerota 300, the same from Gomera, and from Ferro 800.\r\n\r\nThe way of manufacturing the _orchel_ for the uses of dying, was for\r\na considerable time a secret in few hands; but it is now done in\r\nLondon, and other parts of Europe, to great perfection. Mr. Ray, from\r\nImperatus, gives a brief account of the process[92]. Micheli has since\r\ndelivered a more exact detail of it. His, at least, seems to be the\r\nmethod[93], which the dyers at Florence used. From both these accounts,\r\nurine and pot-ash appear to be the principal ingredients used in\r\nextracting its colour.\r\n\r\nMany other plants of this genus contain the same tophaceous matter as\r\nthe _orchel_; and upon trial have been found to strike a good colour.\r\nMicheli, after he has related the preparation of the _orchel_, suggests\r\nthe same thing; and M. Hellot, in the treatise before mentioned, tells\r\nus, there are many other mosses, which will give as good a colour as\r\nthe _orchel_. In fact, he adds, that M. Bernard de Jussieu brought him\r\nsome from the forest of Fontainbleau, which, upon experiments with\r\nurine and lime, took a purple colour. In the sequel of this memoir we\r\nshall point out some of these kinds. M. Hellot has given us a process,\r\nwhich he made use of for discovering whether any of these lichens\r\nwould yield a red or purple colour. It is as follows: “Put about two\r\ndrachms of any of these lichens into a little glass jar: moisten it\r\nwell with equal parts of strong lime-water, and volatile spirit of _sal\r\nammoniac_; tie a wet bladder close over the top of the vessel, and let\r\nit stand three or four days. At the end of this time, if the lichen\r\nis likely to answer, that small quantity of liquor, which you will\r\nfind in the glass, will be of a deep crimson red; and the plant will\r\nretain the same colour when the liquor is all dried up. If neither the\r\nliquor nor the plant have taken any colour, it is needless to make any\r\nfurther trials with it.” This process is simple and easy, and well\r\nworth observation by all who are disposed to prosecute experiments of\r\nthis nature: and indeed it is worth the trial, whether several lichens,\r\nwhich we have plentifully enough in England, would not answer in this\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Lichenes pyxidati.\r\n\r\n_Such as consist of a firm tough flexible matter, formed into simple\r\ntubular stalks, whose tops are expanded into the form of little cups._\r\n\r\nThis division contains the cup-mosses of authors; the second order of\r\n_coralloides_ of Dillenius; great part of the first order of lichens in\r\nHaller; the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th order in Micheli; and the _lichenes\r\nschyphiferi_ of Linnæus. Dr. Hill has constituted a genus intirely of\r\nthese cup-mosses, under the name of _pyxidium_.\r\n\r\nThey are common with us on heaths, and other dry and barren places.\r\nSome of them are proliferous, even to the third degree, and form a very\r\nbeautiful appearance. Some have tubercles on the edges of the cups, of\r\na beautiful scarlet colour.\r\n\r\nThe cup-moss[94] was a long time in great and established use for\r\ncoughs, and especially for the whooping cough in children; for which\r\nit was long accounted a specific. To this end it was given in various\r\nforms. Gerard and Parkinson recommend the powder to be taken for\r\nseveral days together. Dr. Willis was particularly one of its patrons.\r\nHe has given us[95] several forms for its exhibition, as that of the\r\npowder, a decoction, and a syrup from it.\r\n\r\nThe present practice has quite exploded it, and very justly perhaps, as\r\nin any degree specific in the above disorder. Nevertheless, it seems to\r\nhave sustained that character with as great a reputation, and perhaps\r\nwith as good a title to it, as almost any of the specifics of that age.\r\nIt has been observed before, on another occasion, that this tribe of\r\nmosses have in general an astringent property; as such, the cup-mosses\r\nare consequently of a strengthening nature: it is no wonder, therefore,\r\nthat they should be helpful in this disorder, merely as corroborants.\r\nThat they were useful in some measure can scarcely be doubted; and\r\nour very eminent Dr. Huxham[96], in treating upon this obstinate\r\ncomplaint, seems to allow this of the cup-moss in preference to other\r\nidle specifics. Happily for us, the Peruvian bark supplies a remedy of\r\ninfinitely more use, where such analeptics are required.\r\n\r\nDr. Lister, in some ingenious observations of his, printed in the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions[97], touching colours and dyes, observes,\r\nthat the scarlet heads of these mosses, upon the affusion of lye, will\r\nstrike a purple which will stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Lichenes crustacei.\r\n\r\n_Such as consist of a dry and friable matter, more or less thick,\r\nformed into flat crusts, very closely adhering to whatever they grow\r\nupon._\r\n\r\nSome of the species of this division consist of an exceeding fine thin\r\ncrustaceous, or rather, as Micheli calls it, farinaceous matter, the\r\nfructifications appearing in the form of tubercles. Others consist of\r\na thicker scabrous crust, having the fructifications in the form of\r\nlittle cups, called _scutellæ_.\r\n\r\nThis division contains the first order of the _lichenoides_ of\r\nDillenius; the 5th, 6th, and 7th orders of Haller’s lichens; the\r\n_lichenes leprosi_ and _crustacei_ of Linnæus; and several of the\r\n_placodium_ of Hill.\r\n\r\nThe species are numerous, and most of them very common on rocks,\r\nstones, old walls, the bark of trees, old pales, _&c._ which are\r\ncommonly covered over with them, in undisturbed places. They form a\r\nvery agreeable variety, and some of them have a very elegant appearance.\r\n\r\nDr. Dillenius describes a species of this order, which he found upon\r\nthe tops of the mountains in Caernarvonshire in Wales; and which the\r\ninhabitants told him they used as a red dye, and found it preferable\r\nto the cork, or arcel, which they call _kenkerig_. He has intitled it,\r\nin English, _The white tartareous scarlet-dying lichenoides_[98]. He\r\nis of opinion, that this is the moss which Martin mentions, in his\r\naccount of the Western Islands of Scotland, under the name of _corkir_;\r\nwith which the inhabitants of the island of Sky dye a scarlet colour.\r\nThey prepare it by drying, powdering it, and then steeping it for three\r\nweeks in urine. Linnæus queries whether this moss be not the same as\r\nhis _lichen calcareus_[99]; a species so peculiar to limestone rocks,\r\nthat where-ever that stone occurs among others, it may be distinguished\r\nat the first view by this moss growing upon it. This is a singularity\r\nwhich Dr. Dillenius has not mentioned in his moss: on the other hand,\r\nLinnæus does not mention any tinging property in his.\r\n\r\nThe _pérèlle d’Auvergne_, or _orseille de terre_, of the French,\r\nbelongs to this order of lichens, and is called by Dillenius[100] _The\r\ncrayfish-eye-like lichenoides_. It is gathered in large quantities in\r\nthe province of Auvergne, and is used as _orchel_; to which however\r\nit is greatly inferior. They prepare it with lime and urine; and were\r\nacquainted with its use as a dye long before the Canary weed was\r\nknown[101] to them; and it is at this day in more common use than\r\nthe _orchel_. We have it frequent with us upon old walls, rocks, and\r\nstones; but it is to be had in larger quantities in several other parts\r\nof Europe.\r\n\r\nThe mealy tartareous _lichenoides_[102] with brown dishes, forms an\r\narticle of trade with the people of West Gothland. They manufacture\r\na beautiful red dye from it, which they sell under the name of\r\n_byttelet_[103]. Dr. Hill says we have this moss abundantly in\r\nLeicestershire and Warwickshire.\r\n\r\nThe Welch make a red dye, with urine, from another moss of this order,\r\nwhich Dillenius describes[104] by the name of _The large leprous\r\nlichenoides with yellow plates_. These are not the only species, which\r\nare endowed with a tinging quality: other kinds have been observed to\r\ngive a red or purple colour to paper in which they have occasionally\r\nbeen inclosed. Doubtless several would, upon sufficient trials, be\r\nfound to answer equally well with the _orchel_.\r\n\r\nWith regard to these crustaceous mosses in general, it is highly\r\nworthy our regard, that in the œconomy of nature they answer singular\r\nand important uses. To an unobserving eye, no class of vegetables may\r\nappear more insignificant, or less adapted to advantageous purposes\r\nin the creation, than these. This vulgar estimation of things is\r\nfrequently erroneous; and it is certainly so in the instance before\r\nus. These minute and seemingly insignificant mosses serve, under some\r\ncircumstances, to valuable purposes. No sooner is a rock left bare by\r\nthe sea, but these lichens lay the foundation for its future fertility.\r\nTheir seeds, which are presently brought thither by the winds, soon\r\ncover it all over. These corrupting, presently afford a soil sufficient\r\nto nourish other smaller mosses; which, in their turn, form one deep\r\nenough for larger plants and trees; and thus the rock becomes a fertile\r\nisland[105].\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Lichenes foliacei scutellati.\r\n\r\n_Such as consist of a more lax and flexible matter, formed into a\r\nfoliaceous appearance, having the parts of fructification in the form\r\nof_ scutellæ.\r\n\r\nSome of the plants of this division are interspersed with the former\r\nin some of the systems of botanic authors. In general this division\r\ncontains the whole first series of the second order of _lichenoides_\r\nin Dillenius; the first division of the second series, and the latter\r\npart of the second division, of the same: it comprehends the _lichenes\r\nimbricati_ and _umbilicati_ of Linnæus; and many of the _placodium_ of\r\nHill.\r\n\r\nThe plants of this order are many of them not less common in England\r\nthan the foregoing, on rocks, stones, old pales, trees, _&c._ Some\r\nadhere very closely to what they grow upon, and seem to be only\r\nfoliaceous about the edges: others adhere but loosely, and are much\r\nexpanded and divaricated, so as to form something like ramifications.\r\n\r\nIt was remarked, from Linnæus’s observation, that one of the\r\ncrustaceous lichens was scarcely ever found growing but upon limestone\r\nrocks. On the contrary, the same author has observed of a foliose\r\nlichen belonging to this order, that it will thrive on all kind of\r\nrocks but limestone rocks. This species[106] Dillenius calls _The\r\ncommon grey-blue pitted lichenoides_. It is very common with us upon\r\ntrees, old wooden pales, _&c._ as well as upon rocks and stones. It is\r\nthe _usnea cranii humani_ of the old _materia medica_. Linnæus adds,\r\nthat it will dye a purplish colour.\r\n\r\nHither likewise must be referred the cork or arcel[107], which is\r\nused by the Scotch, and others, to dye a purple or scarlet colour.\r\nThe preparation of it is by powdering, and making it into a mass with\r\nurine. Parkinson tells us[108] the poor people in Derbyshire scrape\r\nit from the rocks, and make the same use of it. Mr. Ray[109] adds to\r\nthis account, that the Welch, who call it _kenkerig_, have long been\r\nacquainted with this property, and have it in common use. The colour\r\nfrom this moss is but very dull; but if the same methods were taken\r\nto improve it, as have been with the _orchel_, it would undoubtedly\r\nbe rendered much better, and more durable. Linnæus relates[110], that\r\nthere is an immense quantity of this moss about the rocks of the isle\r\nof Aland in the Baltick; where the good women themselves make a yellow\r\ndye with it from a simple decoction of the plant, without the addition\r\nof any saline article. He adds, that those, who would heighten the\r\ncolour, add a small quantity of _roucou_[111] to the decoction.\r\n\r\nProfessor Linnæus tells us, that the Gothlanders manufacture a yellow\r\ndye from the common curled _lichenoides_ with yellow leaves and\r\nplates[112]. He adds, that it is a celebrated medicine in the esteem\r\nof the country people, as a specific in the jaundice[113]. Helwingius,\r\nin the Supplement to the _Flora Prussica_, affirms, that this moss\r\nwill tinge paper and linen of a lively carnation colour, which too\r\nwill stand the test of being exposed to the open sun for a long time\r\nwithout fading. It seems very probable, however, that he must mean some\r\nother plant of this genus, as Dillenius tells us he made the experiment\r\nunsuccessfully.\r\n\r\nSweden affords a moss of this order, which, as far as hitherto appears,\r\nseems to be unknown to former botanists, and which Linnæus says will\r\ndye a deep purple colour[114].\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Lichenes erecti ramosi plani.\r\n\r\n_Such as consist of a firm tough matter, disposed into flat and thin\r\nramifications growing erect, and bearing their scutellæ upon the edges,\r\nsurfaces, and at the extremities._\r\n\r\nThis division comprehends the flat branched tree-mosses of authors;\r\nmany of the fourth order of Haller’s lichens; the first part of the\r\nsecond division of series the second in Dillenius; and the _platisma_\r\nof Hill.\r\n\r\nThe plants of this division grow upon old trees, especially in thick\r\nand unfrequented woods; some of them upon rocks: they are many of them\r\nextremely common in England upon all kinds of trees. As they were some\r\nof the most obvious, so they were some of the first lichens noticed by\r\nthe old writers, by whom they were called _lichenes arborum_.\r\n\r\nThe mosses of this order were substituted in the room of the _usnea_\r\nin the composition of the _pulvis cyprius_. The very species, which\r\nwas most frequently used for this purpose, was the channel-leaved\r\n_lichenoides_ of Dillenius[115], on account of its being easily reduced\r\ninto a fine powder, of a good white colour. Nevertheless, others are\r\nundoubtedly as well adapted to the same purposes: and, if it was of\r\nimportance enough to employ them to any purposes of the like nature in\r\nour own country, they might be procured in sufficient plenty.\r\n\r\nOne of the plants of this order is applicable to the same uses as\r\nthe Canary-weed, and is reckoned not much inferior to it; and as it\r\nis found in the same places, it is very often packed up with it in\r\nconsiderable quantities. Dillenius calls it _The flat dyers lichenoides\r\nwith longer and sharper horns_[116]. It is truly and properly a plant\r\nof the lichen genus, tho’ the older writers of the last century\r\ncalled it a fucus. They were led into this mistake by its having flat\r\nramifications, and from its growing on the rocks by the sea side. It is\r\nfound in the East Indies upon trees, and is frequent on the coasts of\r\nthe Mediterranean, as well as about the Canary Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Lichenes peltati.\r\n\r\n_Such as consist of a tough or coriaceous matter, disposed into a\r\nfoliaceous appearance; on the edges of which, in general, the parts of\r\nfructification are placed, in the form of flattish oblong bodies, in\r\nthese mosses called_ shields _or_ pelts.\r\n\r\nThis division contains the third series of the second order of\r\nDillenius’s _lichenoides_; the _lichenes coriacei_ of Linnæus; and\r\nseveral of the _placodium_ of Hill.\r\n\r\nThat celebrated and well-known plant, the ash-coloured ground\r\nliverwort[117] of Ray belongs to this order. It is very common all over\r\nEngland on dry and barren ground; and indeed almost all Europe, and\r\nAmerica too, seems to afford it in sufficient plenty, as we find it\r\nobserved by almost all the botanic writers since Ray, who was one of\r\nthe first that described it.\r\n\r\nThe earliest account we have of its use for the bite of a mad dog is in\r\nthe Philosophical Transactions[118], from Mr. Dampier, in whose family\r\nit had been a secret for a number of years. It was communicated first\r\nto Sir Hans Sloane, as a kind of fungus, or Jew’s-ear; and, at the\r\nrequest of Dr. Mead, was some years afterwards received into the London\r\ndispensatory. Scarce any of the boasted specifics of former ages ever\r\nacquired so great reputation as this plant has done in modern times,\r\nfor its prevalence against the bite of a mad dog; and the patronage\r\nof the late learned Dr. Mead made it sufficiently known throughout\r\nall the world. Happy would it be indeed, if it fully deserved the\r\nhigh encomiums, which have been bestowed upon it. A great and eminent\r\nphysician[119] has doubted its efficacy at all in such cases; and\r\nit is well known, that Boerhaave even laughed at it. Dr. Mead had\r\ncertainly an high opinion of it: he tells us it never failed, thro’\r\nthe course of thirty years experience, where it was duly given before\r\nthe _hydrophobia_ came on[120]. Later instances have shewn, that it is\r\nnot infallible; and Dr. Van Swieten’s supposition is but too likely\r\nto prove true. It must be confessed, that Dr. Mead’s exhibition of it\r\nseems too much complicated with other means to leave room for judging\r\nfully of its real efficacy; and it may really be questioned, whether\r\nbleeding, pepper, and cold-bathing, have not had more to do in the case\r\nthan the lichen.\r\n\r\nThe _muscus pulmonarius officinarum_[121], tree-lungwort, or oak-lungs,\r\nbelongs to this order. It is found about old oaks, and upon rocks and\r\nstones overgrown with moss, in many of our thick woods in England; but\r\nnot in any great plenty.\r\n\r\nFew, perhaps, of the antiquated simples were in more repute, in their\r\nday, than this plant. It was celebrated for ages, on account of its\r\nsupposed prevalence in pulmonary complaints of almost all kinds; and\r\nyet, upon inquiry into the original of its use in such cases, it would\r\nprobably appear, that it arose more from a fansied resemblance they\r\nfound in the plant to the lungs themselves, than from any real and\r\nwell-grounded proofs of its efficacy. As a gentle astringent, like most\r\nother species of the family, it would doubtless contribute to relieve\r\nin many cases where the lungs were affected, as in _hæmoptoës_, and\r\nsome others: but it does not seem, by any means, to deserve that high\r\ncharacter in medicine which has been given to it.\r\n\r\nThe people in Herefordshire, where this moss is called _rags_, dye\r\ntheir stockings of a brown colour with it. This is done by a very\r\nstrong but simple decoction in water, and the colour stands well[122].\r\n\r\nThe fine green _lichenoides_ with black warts[123], is a celebrated\r\nmedicine, and in very frequent use, with the country people about\r\nUpsal, for the thrush in children: to this end they give an infusion\r\nof it in milk. A medicine of this kind is of great importance in those\r\ncountries, where that disorder occurs much more frequently than with\r\nus[124]. It is not received into the Swedish dispensatory; but is known\r\nhowever in the shops, under the name of _muscus cumatilis_. We have it\r\nnot in England; and Dillenius found it but in one place about Geissen:\r\nin the woods of Sweden it is more plentiful. A singular case, which\r\nis related in the _Amænitates Academicæ_[125], has given rise to an\r\nopinion of its usefulness in the worms also. The case briefly was this:\r\nA country girl had, for near half a year, complained of excruciating\r\npains in her stomach and bowels, which were attended with vomiting,\r\nanxiety, and great watchfulness. All that had been prescribed for her\r\nby Professor Linnæus and others, who took her case for the worms,\r\nproved altogether fruitless. Being afterwards left to the care of her\r\nneighbours and relations, some good women gave her a decoction of this\r\nmoss, which the Uplanders call _elfnefwer_. After she had taken it a\r\nfew days, she vomited up six or seven roundish worms, and was cured.\r\nThese were found, upon examination, to be the maggots of a kind of\r\nbrown bee-fly, described by Mr. Ray[126], and by Linnæus[127].\r\n\r\nHowever insufficient this history may be, to prove the usefulness of\r\nthis plant as a vermifuge, it will at least serve to exemplify this\r\nfact; namely, that other animals of the insect kind, besides the\r\n_teniæ_, _lumbrici_, and _ascarides_, may subsist a long time in the\r\n_primæ viæ_ of the human body, and be the cause of great disturbances\r\ntherein[128].\r\n\r\nNecessity is frequently the parent of the most useful and important\r\ndiscoveries: and the uses to which a plant of this order is\r\nappropriated by the natives of Iceland, is a standing proof of the\r\ntruth of this observation. That climate will scarcely permit the\r\ncultivation of any kind of grain; but the want of it is in a great\r\nmeasure happily supplied by the eryngo-leaved _lichenoides_[129], which\r\nis abundant in the northern regions; and in that island particularly\r\nthe natives have long been acquainted with the methods of applying it\r\nboth to the purposes of food and of physic.\r\n\r\nRay has long since informed us[130], from Bartholine, that in the\r\nspring time, while it is young, it will purge; in consequence of which\r\nit is used as common spring physic. This quality it loses in a short\r\ntime; and what serves for physic in the spring, is converted the\r\nremaining part of the year into food. They collect large quantities\r\nof it, grind it into meal, and make both pottage and bread of it. It\r\nis in common use not only with the islanders, but in several parts\r\nof Sweden also, where it is found to be a very appropriate diet in\r\nphthisical cases[131]. These accounts of the excellent use of this\r\nlichen correspond perfectly well with the last accounts of it in Mr.\r\nHorrebow’s Natural History of Iceland, just published; and which I\r\nshall take the liberty of transcribing as follows: “There is another\r\nherb, called _muscus catharticus islandiæ_, or mountain-grass, which\r\nthey cook up into a delicate dish. I have often eat of it; at first out\r\nof curiosity, but afterwards for its palateableness and wholesomeness.\r\nThe excellent qualities of this herb are described in the Memoires\r\nof the Society of Arts and Sciences in Sweden. It grows in great\r\nabundance; and those that live near the places, where it is found,\r\ngather great quantities for their own use, and to send to market.\r\nPeople that live at a great distance will send and fetch horse-loads\r\naway. Many use no meal or flour at all, when they are stocked with this\r\nherb, which in every respect is good and wholesome food”[132].\r\n\r\nThis moss is not very common in the southern countries of Europe.\r\nEngland affords it but very sparingly. Mr. Newton and Dr. Dillenius\r\nfound it in Wales; Sibbald, in Scotland. It is frequent on the Alps of\r\nSwitzerland; and Dr. Haller mentions it in his _Iter Hercynium_. Sweden\r\nand Lapland have it in plenty: and on account of its great abundance\r\nand usefulness in Iceland, Bartholine, and after him others, called it\r\n_muscus islandicus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nI cannot help remarking, by way of conclusion, that we have in this\r\ngenus of plants a convincing instance of the utility which may\r\nresult from the study of natural science in general, and even of\r\nits minuter and hitherto most neglected branches. From a view of\r\nthe foregoing memoir it is evident, I presume, that the œconomical\r\nuses of the lichens, in the various parts of the world, are already\r\nvery considerable and important: and altho’ it does not appear, that\r\nthe sensible qualities of any of them, or the experience of former\r\nages, will warrant our ascertaining any singular powers to them in a\r\nmedicinal way, yet posterity will doubtless find the means of employing\r\nthem to many valuable purposes in human life to us unknown.\r\n\r\nIt will at once be acknowleged, that the vegetable kingdom supplies\r\nus with the far greater share of the necessaries, the conveniences,\r\nand even the elegancies, of life. The cultivation of that knowlege,\r\nwhich leads to the investigation of its subjects, cannot, therefore,\r\nbut be highly useful and necessary: and altho’ the bare science of\r\nnatural knowlege is of itself worthy of applause, yet it ought to\r\nbe considered, in reality, as the necessary means only of applying\r\nthe subjects of nature’s kingdoms to their true ends and purposes,\r\nthe service of mankind. To know and distinguish, by determined and\r\nspecific characters, even but a small share of that amazing multitude\r\nof objects, with which the great Parent of nature has furnished our\r\nglobe, is a task far more than equal to the duration of human life. To\r\ninvestigate and ascertain their various qualities and uses is equally\r\narduous and impracticable. While the naturalists, therefore, are\r\nemployed in distinguishing the forms of things, let others exert the\r\nunited efforts of genius and application to investigate their various\r\nproperties and uses. I need not say the field for both is boundless:\r\nit doubtless will be so for ages yet to come. The hopes of discovering\r\nsome latent property, which may turn out to the advantage of his\r\nfellow creatures, will animate the man, whose mind is truly formed for\r\nrelishing the pleasures of natural science; and however the result may\r\nbe, the inspection and contemplation of nature’s productions will ever\r\nafford that satisfaction, which will amply repay him for his trouble.\r\nThe minuter, and, as they are commonly estimated, the most abject and\r\ninsignificant things are not beneath our notice; and an attentive mind\r\nwill readily conceive how much farther, and more extensively useful,\r\nevery branch of nature’s kingdom may yet prove in the œconomy of\r\nhuman life. The man, therefore, whom a genius and love for natural\r\nhistory has allured into its pursuits, and whose leisure permits his\r\ngratification in such researches, if he is not happy enough to be\r\ncrowned with success, at least deserves it, and merits the thanks of\r\nhis fellow-creatures for his application and diligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCII. _An Account of the fossile Bones of an Allegator, found on\r\nthe Sea-shore, near_ Whitby _in_ Yorkshire. _In a Letter to_ John\r\nFothergill, _M. D. from Capt._ William Chapman.\r\n\r\n                                          Whitby, 20th of 1st mo. 1758.\r\n\r\n[Read May. 4, 1758.]\r\n\r\nA Few days since we discovered on the sea-shore, about half a mile from\r\nthis place, part of the bones of an animal, appearing as in the annexed\r\nfigure (_See_ TAB. XXII.). The ground they laid in is what we call\r\nallum-rock; a kind of black slate, that may be taken up in flakes, and\r\nis continually wearing away by the surf of the sea, and the washing of\r\nstones, sand, _&c._ over it every tide.\r\n\r\nThe bones were covered five or six feet with the water every full\r\nsea, and were about nine or ten yards from the cliff, which is nearly\r\nperpendicular, and about sixty yards high, and is continually wearing\r\naway, by the washing of the sea against it; and, if I may judge by\r\nwhat has happened in my own memory, it must have extended beyond\r\nthese bones less than a century ago. There are several regular strata\r\nor layers of stone, of some yards thickness, that run along the cliff,\r\nnearly parallel to the horizon and to one another. I mention this to\r\nobviate an objection, that this animal may have been upon the surface,\r\nand in a series of years may have sunk down to where it lay; which will\r\nnow appear impossible, at least when the stones, _&c._ have had their\r\npresent consistence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Philos. Trans. Vol. L._ TAB. XXII(b) _p. 689_.\r\n\r\n_J. Mynde sc._]\r\n\r\n\r\n_References to the Draught._\r\n\r\n_A_, _B_, _C_, the head and bill, not in the same line or range with\r\nthe rest of the bones.\r\n\r\n_a_, _b_, A bone, with its processes, which I take to be similar to\r\nthat, which includes the brain in fishes. The part between the bone and\r\noutlines appeared to be a smooth membrane; but was so thin, that in\r\ntaking up it broke.\r\n\r\n  It is evident this is the upper part of the head inverted.\r\n\r\n_B_, _C_, the superior _maxilla_ intire, and in some places covered\r\nwith the inferior one for four or five inches together. Where this\r\nhappens, the vacuity is filled with matter like the rock in which it\r\nlays; and there are large teeth in each jaw, at such distances, and so\r\nposited, that those in one jaw fill up the vacuities in the other, and\r\nappear like one continued row, the mouth being shut.\r\n\r\n  Where there is only the superior _maxilla_ remaining, there are\r\n  no teeth; but the sockets are visible and deep, and at the same\r\n  distances from each other as the teeth in the other part of the jaw.\r\n  The tip or extremity of the bill was intire for four or five inches,\r\n  having both _maxillæ_, with their teeth, and towards the point large\r\n  fangs. Part of the bill and head were covered with the rock; which\r\n  was removed before they appeared as in the figure.\r\n\r\n_A_, _D_, _F_, _G_, cavities in the rock, about two inches deep, where,\r\nI suppose, the wanting _vertebræ_ have laid, as they are exactly suited\r\nto have received them.\r\n\r\n_D_, _F_, Ten _vertebræ_, from three to four half inches in diameter,\r\nand about three inches long, some of them separated in taking up. They\r\nwere about two inches in the rock.\r\n\r\n_E,_ Here we observed something like bone to stretch from the\r\n_vertebræ_, and intending to take it up whole, begun to cut at what\r\nwe thought a proper distance; but found we cut thro’ a bone; and with\r\nthe _vertebræ_ brought up three or four inches of the _os femoris_,\r\nwith the ball, covered with the _periosteum_: but the animal has been\r\nso crushed hereabouts, that we could make little of the socket or _os\r\ninnominata_. Several of the ribs came up with the _vertebræ_: they were\r\nbroke, and laid parallel to the _vertebræ_; but not quite close, there\r\nbeing some of the rock between them. The _periosteum_ is visible on\r\nmany of the bones.\r\n\r\n_G_, _H_, Twelve _vertebræ_ remaining in the rock, with which they are\r\nalmost covered, especially towards the extremity.\r\n\r\nThe place, where these bones lay, was frequently covered with sea-sand,\r\nto the depth of two feet, and seldom quite bare; which was the occasion\r\nof their being rarely seen: but being informed that they had been\r\ndiscovered by some people two or three years ago, we had one of them\r\nwith us upon the spot, who told us, that when he first saw it, it\r\nwas intire, and had two short legs on that part of the _vertebræ_\r\nwanting towards the head. Altho’ we could not suspect the veracity of\r\nthis person, we thought he was mistaken; for we had hitherto taken\r\nit for a fish. But when we took it up, and found the _os femoris_\r\nabove-mentioned, we had cause to believe his relation true, and to rank\r\nthis animal amongst those of the lizard kind: by the length (something\r\nmore than ten feet) it seems to have been an allegator; but I shall be\r\nglad to have thy opinion about it.\r\n\r\n                           I am thy friend,\r\n                        William Chapman _Sen._\r\n\r\n_The bones were sent up, and are herewith presented to the Royal\r\nSociety by_\r\n\r\n                                                         J.

She had taken the advice of some Surgeons in\r\nthe country, and had used several remedies to no purpose. At last,\r\nhearing of the cure of the paralytic woman, whose case I sent you\r\nsome time ago, she insisted on being brought hither; and underwent a\r\ncourse of electrical shocks for near two months, receiving every day\r\nat least fifty or sixty in the following manner. She sat close by the\r\nmachine, and grasping the phial in her hand, she presented the wire to\r\nthe barrel or conductor, and drew the sparks from it for about half a\r\nminute. The phial being thus charged, she then touched her knee with\r\nthe wire, and thereby received such severe strokes, as would sometimes\r\ninstantly raise a blister on the part. The joint was at last so much\r\nrelaxed, as that she could walk home with the help of a crutch, tho’\r\nher leg was so weak, that she had very little use of it. After she had\r\ncontinued in this state for some weeks, she was advised to use the cold\r\nbath: but that soon brought back the contraction; and I have been since\r\ninformed that she was worse than ever.\r\n\r\n\r\nA soldier’s wife, a genteel looking woman, of about 30 years of age,\r\nwas seized with a slight palsy, about Newcastle, on her way to this\r\ncountry: but before she got to this place, she had lost all the feeling\r\nin her left side, and so far the power of it, that she was brought to\r\nus in a cart. After receiving 600 strokes from the electrical machine\r\nin the usual way, and in the space of two days, she recovered the use\r\nof her side, and set out on foot to make out the rest of her journey.\r\nHowever, for fear of a relapse, I gave her a recommendatory letter\r\nto Mr. Sommer, Surgeon at Haddington, as she was to pass thro’ that\r\ntown, and as I knew that he was likewise provided with an electrical\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\n\r\nA young woman from _Home_, a village in this shire, but at a good\r\ndistance, complained of a coldness and insensibility in her left hand\r\nand wrist, of two years standing. When I felt that hand, it was as cold\r\nas a stone, whilst the other was sweating; and she told me, that it\r\nnever had been warmer all that time. I made her draw the sparks from\r\nan egg (which for some other purpose was suspended by a wire from the\r\nconductor) for about half an hour; and at the end of that time I found\r\nthe dead hand in a far greater sweat than the other. She then wrapt\r\nit up in a piece of flannel, as she used to do, and retired. Next day\r\nshe told me, that since the operation she had been able to put off and\r\non her cloaths without help, which she had not been able to do for a\r\ntwelvemonth before. She was again electrised; and believing she was\r\nthen quite well, she went away: but some weeks after, upon the coldness\r\nof her hand beginning to return, she made me another visit, was again\r\nelectrised, and was dismissed a second time apparently cured. This is\r\nabout two months ago, and I have heard nothing of her since.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs these two last women are at such a distance, I cannot pretend to\r\nsend you their own testimony of their cure. But for the two cases in\r\nthe separate paper, as the persons are inhabitants of this place, I\r\nhave taken care that they themselves should sign them, along with my\r\nfather; since you have acquainted me, that accounts of this kind should\r\nhave the attestation both of the patients and the minister of the\r\nparish.\r\n\r\nI shall only add here, that several persons have been relieved of\r\nrheumatic pains, by electrising the parts affected. And a woman\r\nwas cured of a deafness of six months standing, contracted, as she\r\nimagined, by cold. This woman held the phial in her hand, whilst\r\nanother person standing on a cake of resin gave her the shock, by\r\nputting the end of the wire into her ear. This manner of electrising\r\nbrought always on a profuse sweat over the head, which we encouraged,\r\nby wrapping it up in flannel. The first day she came here, she could\r\nscarce hear what was spoken by those about her; but in five days she\r\nseemed to be perfectly cured.\r\n\r\n                              I am, _&c._\r\n                           Patrick Brydone.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Copy of the separate Paper before mentioned._\r\n\r\nRobert Haigs, of Coldinghame, a labouring man of about 45, after having\r\nbeen for ten days ill of a regular tertian ague, at my desire underwent\r\nthe electrical shocks in the common way. After having received about\r\nthirty or forty very severe ones, he grew pale, and staggering for\r\nseveral steps, would have fallen down, had he not been supported. He\r\nthen fell into a sweat, which continued near half an hour. I desired\r\nhim to come back the next morning, immediately before the fit, which\r\nhe said came on about ten o’clock. He accordingly came, and told me he\r\nhad not the usual symptoms preceding the fit. He was that day again\r\nstrongly electrised; and has been without any aguish symptom ever\r\nsince; _viz._ for the space of four months.\r\n\r\nThe truth of this is attested by\r\n\r\n                                      ROBERT HAIGS, _the person cured_.\r\n                              ROBᵗ.

The fit came on early in the morning. She was electrised on\r\nher well day in the afternoon; and the next morning, having had only a\r\nslight shivering, she was electrised again about ten o’ clock, and has\r\nhad no symptom of the ague since; _viz._ for three months.\r\n\r\nThe above is attested by\r\n\r\n                                         ANN TORRY, _the person cured_.\r\n                              ROBᵗ.

Birch, _D. D. Secret. R. S._\r\n\r\nCAmden, in his Annals of Queen Elizabeth[140], observes, that almost\r\nall, except women and children, who were present at the assizes at\r\nOxford, at the tryal of Rowland Jenkes, a Bookseller there, for\r\nseditious words, died, to the number of about three hundred. Mr.\r\nJohn Stow, in his _Chronicle of England_[141], enlarges this number,\r\nand affirms, that there died in Oxford three hundred persons, and in\r\nother places two hundred and odd, from the 6th of July to the 12th of\r\nAugust; _after which died not any of that sickness; for one of them\r\ninfected not another_: And this historian agrees with Camden, that not\r\nany one woman or child died thereof. Dr. George Ethryg, a physician,\r\nwho practised at that time at Oxford[142], in the 2d book of his\r\n_Hypomnemata quædam in aliquot Libros Pauli Æginetæ, seu Observationis\r\nMedicamentorum, quæ hâc ætate in usu sunt_, printed at London in 1588,\r\nin 8vo, mentions, that on the first night of the appearance of the\r\ndissease about six hundred fell sick of it; and that the next night\r\nan hundred more were seized in the villages near Oxford. Lord Bacon,\r\nin his _Natural History_, evidently refers to this, and one or two\r\nmore instances of the same kind, in the following passage, _Century_\r\nX. _Nº._ 914. “The most pernicious infection next the plague is the\r\nsmell of the goal, where prisoners have been long and close and nastily\r\nkept; whereof we have had in our time experience twice or thrice, when\r\nboth the judges, that sat upon the goal, and numbers of those, that\r\nattended the business, or were present, sickened upon it, and died.\r\nTherefore it were good wisdom, that in such cases the goal were aired\r\nbefore they be brought forth.” We have likewise an account in Mr.\r\nAnthony Wood[143], that at the quarter-session at Cambridge, in Lent in\r\nthe year 1522, and the 13th of the reign of Henry VIII. the justices,\r\ngentlemen, and bailiffs, with most of the persons present, were seized\r\nwith a disease, which proved mortal to a considerable number of them;\r\nthose, who escaped, having been very dangerously sick. With regard to\r\nthe unhappy instance of the same kind of contagion, which happened at\r\nthe session in the Old Baily in May 1750, see Dr. Pringle’s excellent\r\nwork, intitled, _Observations on the Diseases of the Army in Camp and\r\nin Garison_[144].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCVI. _A Description of the Plan of_ Peking, _the Capital of_ China;\r\n_sent to the Royal Society by Father_ Gaubil, è Societate Jesu.\r\n_Translated from the_ French.\r\n\r\nKING CHE. THE COURT.\r\n\r\n[Read June 1, 1758.]\r\n\r\nIN this plan are the inclosures of walls, which form as it were three\r\ncities.\r\n\r\n[Kong tching, Tse kin.]\r\n\r\nThe first is the imperial palace, or imperial city. It is called _Kong\r\ntching_ or _Tse kin_. The numbers 11, 17, 21, 24, mark the great gates\r\nof this inclosure.\r\n\r\n[Hoang tching.]\r\n\r\nThe second inclosure is _Hoang tching_. The numbers 3, 18, 30, 86, mark\r\nfour great gates of this inclosure.\r\n\r\n[King tching.]\r\n\r\nThe third inclosure is _King tching_, or Royal City. The numbers 235,\r\n1, 99, 146, 173, 183, 188, 109, 211, mark nine gates of this inclosure.\r\n\r\nAt the four angles east and west of the north and south walls is a\r\nlarge pavillion in the form of a fortress. It is a kind of arsenal\r\nor magazine of arrows, bows, guns, bucklers, cuirasses, pikes, small\r\ncannon, _&c._\r\n\r\nObserve the angle made by the inclosure _Hoang tching_ on the south of\r\nthe gate Nº. 84, to the north of Nº. 260. The inclosure extends to the\r\neast, then to the south, and continues to the east, passing by Nº. 3.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Philos. Trans. Vol. L._ TAB. XXIV. _p. 704_.\r\n\r\n_J. Mynde sc._ ]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Philos. Trans. Vol. L._ TAB. XXV. _p. 704_.\r\n\r\n_J. Mynde sc._]\r\n\r\n1. is the great gate _Hien men_. As you go on to the north, 2, 143,\r\n214, are three gates of a great court with magnificent walls. Thro’ the\r\ngate 3 you enter into a court, where is the _Tay miao_ Nº. 7. There are\r\nreposited the tablets of the ancestors of the reigning emperor, and of\r\nthe illustrious subjects deceased, who have served the dynasty. This\r\n_miao_ or palace is a vast one, and well kept. At regular times the\r\nemperor, princes, and great men, go thither to perform ceremonies.\r\n\r\nNº. 9 is the _Che tsi tan_, where are performed, at regular times, the\r\nceremonies to the ancients, who have taught the art of agriculture.\r\nThis palace is a very beautiful one. 4, 5, 6, are the gates of a court,\r\nwhere the _reguli_ and princes go frequently to receive the emperor’s\r\norders. There are halls for their reception. The mandarins give them\r\ntea to drink, and mark their names in a register. When upon the fixed\r\ndays they cannot attend, they are required to give notice of it. It is\r\nin this court, that the tributary princes, or their envoys, do homage,\r\nand receive the presents of the emperor; which presents are considered\r\nas rewards.\r\n\r\nNº. 11 is _Ou men_, the great gate with a beautiful pavillion of a\r\nconsiderable height, in which is a large bell[145]. This gate, with\r\nthose marked Nº. 12, 13, are those of the great court; whence going\r\nto the north, you enter into the beautiful and vast court _Tay ho\r\ntien_, the gates and galleries of which, with the balconies, make a\r\nfine appearance. In this court, on the first day of the year, and on\r\nother fixed days, the mandarins, according to their ranks, perform the\r\nceremony to the emperor, who is seated on his throne in the hall called\r\n_Tay ho tien_. This hall is a vast and magnificent one. The princes,\r\nministers, and great men of the first order, place themselves there\r\nby the emperor. It is in this hall, that the emperor gives audience\r\nto foreign princes and their ambassadors. You go up to this hall by\r\nmagnificent steps.\r\n\r\nTo the north of _Tay ho tien_ is a large court, whither the princes,\r\ngreat men, ministers, and principal mandarins, go in turns every day,\r\nto receive the emperor’s orders, or to present their petitions. To the\r\nnorth of this court are the apartments of the emperor, the empress, the\r\nqueens, and ladies. The great gate of the place, where these apartments\r\nare, is Nº. 23. All these apartments are in the space contained within\r\nthe walls, which have this figure\r\n\r\n  +-----   -----+\r\n  |     23      |.\r\n  +----- A -----+\r\n\r\nAt A is a beautiful gate to the south. The walls of the inclosure of\r\nthe apartments of the emperor and empress are higher than those of the\r\ninclosures of the queens and ladies. In them are orchards, jets d’eau,\r\nflowering shrubs, and a great number of small chambers for the eunuchs.\r\n\r\nTo the west of the court _Tay ho tien_ is the fine palace _Tsi ning\r\nkong_. The empress-mother lives there at present. Every thing in this\r\npalace is beautiful. There are little gardens very neat and well kept.\r\nAt the east of the _Tay ho tien_ is likewise a fine palace, where\r\nthe prince heir, with his court, resided in the time of the emperor\r\n_Kanghi_. It is a very beautiful palace, and highly ornamented.\r\n\r\nIn the inclosure of _Kong tching_, or _Tse kin_, there are tribunals, a\r\ngreat number of magazines, manufactures, the imperial apothecary’s shop\r\nand printing-house; schools for the Chinese and Tartar languages; and\r\nseveral temples of idols, one of which, lately made for the lamas, cost\r\nimmense sums.\r\n\r\nNº. 26, 28, 29, are the gates of the great inclosure called _Kin chan_.\r\nIt is properly a beautiful pleasure-house, which the present emperor\r\nhas caused to be extremely embellished. There are in it fine gardens\r\nwith walks of trees, very rich and elegant apartments, halls for the\r\nmusicians and comedians. From the mountain _m_, the last emperor of the\r\ndynasty _Ming_, seeing the city taken by the rebels, hanged himself\r\non the morning of the 15th of April of the year of our Lord 1644. On\r\nthe day before, the 14th of April, the empress hanged herself in the\r\nevening in the palace. The mountain in _Kin chan_ was made by art a\r\nlong time ago.\r\n\r\nAt the west of the inclosure _Kin chan_ and _Tse kin_ observe the\r\ngreat laos. 54 is the _peta_, or white pyramid. This pyramid stands\r\non a small mountain, which makes an island. The present emperor has\r\nbuilt there, in the form of an amphitheatre, I do not know how many\r\napartments with covered and open galleries, well built, and in a good\r\ntaste: the point of view is charming, and the galleries, which run\r\nover the lake, are extremely beautiful. There are two or three temples\r\nof idols. 53 is a fine building with a temple of idols; and in it a\r\nstatue of _Fo_ of an extraordinary height. It is of copper, gilt, and\r\ncost great sums. 76 is a very beautiful palace called _Yng tay_, with\r\nfine gardens, fine halls, and fine walks.\r\n\r\n55 is the palace, in which is placed the tablet of the emperor _Kang\r\nhi_, grandfather to the present emperor, who at regular times goes\r\nthither, in order to honour the memory of that great prince, one of the\r\nmost illustrious and fortunate sovereigns of the empire of China.\r\n\r\n81 is the house and church of the French Jesuits. The house stands in\r\n39° 55´ of northern latitude, or possibly some seconds more, and 114°\r\nto the east of the observatory of Paris. This situation, with regard\r\nto latitude and longitude, is founded upon a considerable number of\r\nastronomical observations. By means of a scale, which may be made, we\r\nhave the distance between this house and the other parts of the city,\r\nnorth and south, east and west; as likewise the latitude and longitude\r\nof all the places in the city of Peking. 248 is the house and church\r\nof the Portuguese Jesuits; 170 the house and church of the Portuguese\r\nJesuits[146]; 131 the house and church of the Russians. A little to the\r\neast of Nº. 176 is a small house and chapel for the Russians settled at\r\nPeking for above seventy years past.\r\n\r\n31 is _Kou leou_[147], the Tower of the Drum; 32 is _Tchong leou_, the\r\nTower of the Bell; in which is a very large bell[148].\r\n\r\n179 was formerly the palace of the fourth son of the emperor _Kang hi_\r\nafter the death of _Kang hi_. This prince reigned under the name of\r\n_Yong tching_. His son the present emperor caused this palace to be\r\ndemolished, and to be rebuilt with an extraordinary magnificence. In\r\nthe hall is the tablet of _Yong tching_; and there are in this palace\r\ngrand apartments for the emperor, when he goes thither to honour the\r\nmemory of his father. The emperor has erected here a temple of idols\r\nfor the lama of Thibet; and there are apartments for above three\r\nhundred lama’s. These have Chinese and Tartar disciples to the number\r\nof two hundred. Here are taught, in the Thibetan language, called here\r\n_Tan gout_, the sciences, arts, mathematics, physic, spirituality, and\r\nthe pagan religion. In this beautiful inclosure there are statuaries\r\nand painters. This building is not at all inferior in beauty and\r\nmagnificence to those of the palace of Peking, or to those, which the\r\npresent emperor is going on to erect in his pleasure-houses.\r\n\r\n180 _Koue he kien_ is the imperial college. The great hall, where\r\nConfucius is honoured, is a very beautiful one. There are likewise\r\nhalls for honouring the disciples of this philosopher and several\r\neminent Chinese learned men, who have followed his doctrine with\r\nsuccess. The emperor goes thither sometimes to perform the ceremony to\r\nConfucius as master and instructor to the empire. The avenues, courts,\r\nand apartments, of _Koue he kien_ have a most majestic appearance.\r\n\r\n70 the smaller observatory.\r\n\r\n108 the imperial observatory, built by _Kia hing_, emperor of the last\r\ndynasty _Ming_.\r\n\r\n136 the tribunal of mathematics, _Kin tien kien_.\r\n\r\n137 the tribunal of mandarins, _Ly pou_.\r\n\r\n139 the tribunal of rites and ceremonies[149], _Ly pou_.\r\n\r\n133 _Ping pou_, the tribunal of war.\r\n\r\n134 _Kong pou_, the tribunal for public works.\r\n\r\n140 _Heu pou_, the tribunal for the finances.\r\n\r\n142 the tribunal of princes, _Tsong gin fou_.\r\n\r\n168 _Hing pou_, the tribunal for criminal causes.\r\n\r\n144 _Li fan yuen_, the tribunal for foreign nations, Thibetans,\r\nEleuthians, Russians, and indeed for all foreigners, who come by the\r\nway of Tartary from the west.\r\n\r\n369 _Tou tcha yuen_, the tribunal of the censors of the empire. It has\r\nunder it the _provosts_ and _mare-chaussée_.\r\n\r\n233 the tribunal of _Kieou men ti tou_, or governor of the nine gates,\r\nthat is, the governor of the city.\r\n\r\n185 the tribunal of the judge of the city. This judge is here called\r\n_Fou yn_. He has under him two judges named _Tchi hyen_. One of these\r\nis the judge of the district called _Ouang ping hien_ 193. The other is\r\ncalled the district of _Tay tsing hien_ 182. These districts are within\r\nthe city and without it. What is called at Peking _tou yn_ is called\r\nelsewhere _tchi fou_.\r\n\r\n128 is the tribunal of _Han lin_, or the chosen doctors of the empire.\r\nThis tribunal, called _Han lin yuen_, is a very considerable one: it\r\nhas the care of the registers for the Chinese history. All the learned\r\nmen of the empire, and the colleges and schools, depend upon this\r\ntribunal. Here are chosen the judges and examiners of the compositions\r\nfor the degrees of the learned men; as likewise those, who are most\r\ncapable of writing verses and pieces of eloquence for the use of the\r\npalace and emperor.\r\n\r\n107 _Kong yuen_ is the inclosure, where the compositions are drawn up\r\nfor the examination of the learned men. Here are a great number of\r\nlittle chambers or cells for the composers, and fine apartments for the\r\nmandarins appointed to preserve good order, and to prevent those, who\r\ncompose, from making use of the compositions of others.\r\n\r\n273 _Tchoua kou ting_ is a pavillion, in which is a drum. Mandarins\r\nand soldiers keep guard here day and night. In ancient times, when any\r\nperson had not justice done him, and thought himself oppressed, he went\r\nand beat this drum; at the sound of which the mandarins ran, and were\r\nobliged to carry the complaint of the party oppressed to the great\r\nmen or ministers. Upon which information was taken of the fact, and\r\njustice done. At present the use of this drum is abolished; but it has\r\nbeen thought proper to preserve this ancient monument of the Chinese\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n217 _Ti ouang miao_ is a palace, wherein are the tablets of a great\r\nnumber of the ancient emperors of China. At the time of the equinoxes\r\nthe emperor goes thither to perform the ceremonies to these deceased\r\nemperors. See the notes on the _Ti ouang miao_, p. 723.\r\n\r\n92, and the continuation of the buildings to the north, contain the\r\nmagazines of gunpowder, salt-petre, and nitre. In the city are many\r\nother magazines. I do not name them here. They have their numbers.\r\nThese magazines are of cloth, mats, skins, oil, wine, vinegar, wood,\r\ncoal, porcelain, tea, varnish, silk, _&c._\r\n\r\nThe city is divided into eight quarters for the bannieres of the\r\nTartars _Mantcheou_, the Tartars _Mongou_, and the Chinese called _Han\r\nkun_, who follow the Tartars _Mantcheou_, and submitted to them when\r\nthey entered China. Since that time the Chinese _Han kun_ are become\r\nnumerous and powerful. These eight bannieries are divided by this\r\nmeans as it were into twenty-four; _viz._ eight of _Mantcheou_, eight\r\nof _Mongou_, and eight of _Han kun_. Each banniery has its officers,\r\nmagazines, and arsenal. These are pretty spacious inclosures, each of\r\nwhich has its number.\r\n\r\n94 is an inclosure, in which are kept tygers; and 240 an inclosure,\r\nwherein are elephants.\r\n\r\n65 _Tsan yuen_ is an inclosure for silk-worms.\r\n\r\n147, 150, 151, are public granaries, very well built. Without the gates\r\n146, 173, are many of these public granaries; as also in the environs\r\nof the city to the north, south, east, and west. The largest and most\r\nmagnificent are in the city of _Tong tcheou_, four French Leagues to\r\nthe east of Peking.\r\n\r\n37, 38, 42, 52, 54, 59, 60, 66, 80, 83, 84, 85, 91, 93, 117, 118, 152,\r\n154, 156, 160, 165, 178, 196, 203, 210, 215, 218, 225, 229, 230, 250,\r\n255, 261, these numbers mark temples of idols. Some of these numbers\r\nmark halls for honouring of illustrious deceased persons; but of\r\nthese there are only a few. There are several small _miao_, which are\r\nnot numbered. In the Chinese city, in the suburbs, are many temples\r\nof idols; and some even in the emperor’s palace. And almost all the\r\npalaces of the princes have idol temples.\r\n\r\n33, 35, 36, 61, 62, 64, 67, 68, 71, 109, 126, 128, 133, 134, 135,\r\n136, 137, 139, 140, 141, 142, 144, 180, 182, 185, 193, 219, 222, 233,\r\n243, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 259, 260, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 297,\r\nthese numbers mark the tribunals, as well those, which I have already\r\nmentioned, as many other subaltern ones, which depend on them. There is\r\none for the physicians.\r\n\r\n101, 119, 121, 124, 125, 129, 148, 149, 155, 161, 162, 166, 172, 174,\r\n175, 176, 192, 194, 195, 202, 208, 209, 216, 220, 221, 224, 232,\r\n237, 238, 239, 241, 244, 247, 249, 262, 263, 264, mark the palaces\r\nof the princes of the blood, who are divided into several classes\r\n_Tsing ouang_, _reguli_ of the first order; _Kun ouang_, _reguli_ of\r\nthe second order; _Pey le_, _reguli_ of the third order; _Pey tse_,\r\n_reguli_ of the fourth order; _Kong_, or counts, divided still farther\r\ninto other classes; and _Tsiang kun_, or generals of armies, divided\r\nlikewise into other classes.\r\n\r\nSome years ago the emperor caused to be measured the circumference of\r\nthe walls of _King tching_, of _Hoang tching_, and of _He kin_, _&c._\r\nas likewise the breadth of the streets, the space filled by the _miao_,\r\nour three churches, that of the Russians, palaces, _&c._ The Chinese\r\ncity was not measured. A drawing of all this was made at large,\r\nand then reduced to a smaller scale, as it appears here. I will not\r\nundertake for the perfect exactness of it, either in the measures or\r\nthe reduction. All this is by a Chinese hand. The foot made use of in\r\nthis mensuration is to that of France as 1000 to 1016. 1800 of these\r\nfeet make a _ly_[150]. By the scale to be seen in the small plan, and\r\nfrom the dimensions of the south and east walls of _King tching_, may\r\nbe deduced all the dimensions. The circumference of the walls of the\r\nChinese city has been formerly measured, and well, by several measures;\r\nand the result of them may be seen here by the scale.\r\n\r\nThe south wall of _King tching_ is from east to west eleven _ly_ and\r\nnear a third. The east wall from north to south is nine _ly_ and some\r\npaces. So that the city is not square, as several persons have written.\r\n\r\nThe persons employed by the emperor to measure did not think of\r\nmeasuring the space, which contains the house and church of the\r\ncongregation _de propagandâ fide_. This house and church are situated\r\nto the south between number 207 and a small bridge to the west of\r\nnumber 201.\r\n\r\nIn the accounts sufficient mention has been made of the walls and gates\r\nof the city of _King tching_; for which reason it is not necessary for\r\nme to say any thing concerning it.\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 1267, the Tartar emperor _Koublay han_ (in\r\nChinese _Yuen chi tsou_) built the city called _Ta tou_. It is the\r\nprincipal part of the present city of _King tching_. It contained the\r\n_Kin chun_, a palace _Yng tay_, _Hoang tching_, _Tse kin_, &c. the\r\nwalls of the city, an observatory, the towers of the Drum and the\r\nBell. _Yong lo_, emperor of the last dynasty _Tay ming_, made great\r\nalterations in the city built by _Yuen chi tsou_.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1406 the emperor _Yong lo_ undertook to build stronger and\r\nhigher walls, and more magnificent gates, to the city; to rebuild the\r\n_Hoang tching_, the emperor and empress’s proper habitation, and the\r\nseveral parts of _Tse kin_, the courts, hall of the throne or of _Tay\r\nho tien_, the _Kou leou_, the _Tchong leou_. He undertook also to build\r\nthe _Sien nong tan_ and _Tien tan_, which are now in the Chinese city.\r\nOn account of the wars with the Tartars, the works undertaken by _Yong\r\nlo_ were not finished till the year of our Lord 1421. Since that time,\r\nin the _Kin tchin_ some alterations have been made in the palace, and a\r\ngood number of new _miao_ and palaces have been built. The emperor _Kia\r\ntsing_ built the Chinese city in the year of Christ 1544.\r\n\r\nThe gates and walls of the Chinese city are not all equal in beauty to\r\nthose in the city _King tching_. The streets are neither so broad, nor\r\nso well kept in repair. More than a third of the space of the Chinese\r\ncity is not inhabited. It consists only of fields and gardens. The\r\nspaces occupied by the _Sien nong tan_ and the _Tien tan_ are vast;\r\nand between these two there is a very broad road. In this Chinese\r\ncity are some mosques for the Mahometans. The inhabited part of this\r\ncity is much more so than the city _King tching_ and _Hoang tching_.\r\nIn the Chinese city are vast inns for those, who come out of the\r\nsouthern provinces to Peking. Here are likewise a curious manufacture\r\nof _lieou ly_ or Chinese glass, rich merchants of women’s ornaments,\r\nof gold, of the plant _gin cheng_ so much esteemed and so dear here,\r\nof varnished furniture, tea, stuffs of value, _&c._ The booksellers\r\nshops are also in this city. It is to be remarked, that the walls of\r\nthe Chinese city and _King tching_ do not run directly north and south\r\nand east and west, but decline towards the north-west 2° 30´, and\r\nas much south-east. It is probable, that the architects employed in\r\ndirecting the building of these walls made use of a compass; and that\r\nthe declinatiation of the needle was then what is mentioned above.\r\n\r\nWhat I have said of the walls of the city is likewise to be said of the\r\nwalls of _Hoang tching_ and of _Tse king_.\r\n\r\nAt the time of building the city _King tching_, and the Chinese city,\r\nthe Chinese astronomers very well understood, that the north and south\r\nof the compass was not the north and south of the heavens at Peking;\r\nthey knew, that the needle declined to the north-west and south-east;\r\nbut that this declination was not considerable.\r\n\r\nWithout the gates of the Chinese city, and of _King tching_, I mark the\r\nsuburbs; which are very full of people and merchants, and like so many\r\ncities. In most of these suburbs there are fine temples of idols.\r\n\r\nThe _Sien nong tan_ in the Chinese city is almost six _ly_ in circuit.\r\nThese three words signify, The hill of the ancient husbandmen.\r\n\r\nThe emperor goes thither every year in the spring to till the ground,\r\nand sacrifices on that hill to heaven. The emperor’s apartments there\r\nhave nothing magnificent in them; but the ceremony of ploughing is a\r\nsolemn and curious one, and deserves a particular description. The\r\nemperor tills under a small covering of mat. When he has ploughed\r\nabout half an hour, he ascends a large alcove, from whence he sees\r\nthe princes, great men, and mandarins, plough in the fields, which\r\nare not covered with mats. While the emperor is ploughing, a good\r\nnumber of peasants sing ancient songs on the importance of ploughing.\r\nThe emperor, princes, and great men, are dressed in the habit of\r\nplough-men, and their instruments of husbandry are very neat, and\r\nkept in a magazine. There are granaries for the grain produced by\r\nthis tillage; and it is carefully remarked, that the grain from the\r\nemperor’s tillage is much better than that from the labour of others.\r\nFrom this grain are made several cakes for the various sacrifices to\r\nHeaven or _Chang ti_. The emperor prepares himself for this ceremony by\r\nfasting, prayers to heaven, and a kind of retreat: and the intention\r\nof it is to keep up a memorial of those times, in which the princes\r\nthemselves tilled the ground. This ceremony is of the highest antiquity\r\nin China.\r\n\r\nOver against the _Sien nong tan_ is the _Tien tan_, or Hill of Heaven,\r\nnear ten _ly_ in circuit. Every thing here is magnificent. The emperor\r\ngoes thither every year at the winter solstice to sacrifice to heaven.\r\nHe prepares himself three days for this ceremony by fasting, in a\r\npalace of _Tien tan_, called the _palace of fasting_. The hill, on\r\nwhich the emperor sacrifices, is magnificently adorned. At the four\r\navenues are beautiful triumphal arches of fine marble; and the hill is\r\nascended by elegant steps. In this ceremony are introduced many usages\r\ncontrary to the ancient Chinese doctrine concerning the sacrifice to\r\nheaven. On the day of the winter solstice are added the honours paid\r\nto the five planets, that is, to their spirit. These ceremonies added\r\nto the sacrifice to heaven are not very ancient. There are likewise\r\nhonours to the first founders of the reigning dynasty. At several other\r\ntimes the emperor goes to _Tien tan_ to perform a sacrifice to heaven,\r\nand to honour his deceased ancestors.\r\n\r\nTo the north of the Hill of Heaven is a large and high terrace, on\r\nwhich is a most magnificent hall in honour of _Chang ti_, or the\r\nsovereign Lord, and of his ancestors. On the frontispiece of this hall\r\nthe present Tartar emperors have caused an inscription to be placed\r\nto _Ap cai han_, or the Lord of heaven. To this Tartar inscription\r\nanswers the Chinese character _Kien_; which has the same meaning as\r\nthe character _Tien_, heaven; and it signifies the _Chang ti_, who is\r\nintended to be honoured in this hall. The tablet for the _Chang ti_ is\r\nin a place, which shews, that the honour paid to _Chang ti_ is of a\r\ndifferent kind from the honour paid to ancestors.\r\n\r\nWithout the eastern gate of _King tching_, Nº. 145, is _Ge tan_, or\r\nHill of the Sun. At the vernal equinox the emperor sends hither a\r\nprince or great man to honour the sun, that is, the spirit of the sun.\r\nThis inclosure, tho’ elegant enough, has nothing very remarkable; nor\r\nis the ceremony very ancient.\r\n\r\nWithout the north gate of _King tching_, at Nº. 183, is _Ti tan_, or\r\nthe Hill of the Earth. At the summer solstice the emperor goes thither\r\nto sacrifice to the earth on the hill. Many of the learned men at\r\npresent distinguish this sacrifice in the _Ti tan_ from the sacrifice\r\nin the _Tien tan_. But, according to the doctrine of Confucius, the\r\nsacrifice to the earth has the same object as the sacrifice to heaven.\r\nIn both the supreme Lord _Chang ti_ is to be honoured. I do not know,\r\nwhether the emperor adheres to the pure doctrine of Confucius, and\r\nwhether he does not pretend to honour the earth, or spirit of the\r\nearth, by performing a sacrifice, which originally had for its object\r\nthe _Chang ti_, as we are assured by Confucius. The inclosure of _Ti\r\ntan_ is a vast one; but is not at all equal in beauty to the _Tien tan_.\r\n\r\nWithout the western gate of _King tching_, Nº. 211, is _Yue tan_, the\r\nHill of the Moon. At the autumnal equinox the emperor sends thither a\r\nprince or great man to honour the moon, or spirit of the moon. This\r\nceremony is not very ancient. This inclosure is a neat one, and pretty\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\nBetween the two north gates of _King tching_, Nº. 183 and 188, is a\r\nvast esplanade for the exercise of the troops both horse and foot.\r\n\r\nTo the north of this esplanade are two beautiful temples of idols for\r\nthe lamas. These two monasteries are very elegant. The emperor and the\r\nTartars _Mon gou_ lay out great sums on these two monasteries and the\r\ntwo temples of the lamas.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1111 before Christ, _Ou ouang_, founder of the dynasty\r\n_Tcheou_, nominated his brother _Tchao kong_ prince of _Yen_. _Yen_ is\r\nthe ancient name of a pretty extensive country, in which Peking stands.\r\nThis prince of _Yen_ built a city there, a league and half south-west\r\nof the city _King tching_. This city was called _Yen king_, or the\r\ncourt of _Yen_. It became afterwards considerable; and the prince of\r\n_Yen_ very powerful in the country of _Petcheli_ and _Leao tong_. In\r\nthe year 222 before Christ the emperor _Tsin chi hoang_ destroyed the\r\npower of the princes of _Yen_, the defendants of _Tchao kong_, and\r\nseized their dominions. The founder of the dynasty _Han_ destroyed the\r\npower of the family of _Tsin chi hoang_. In the time of the dynasty\r\n_Tsin_, before the Christian æra, and of the dynasty _Han_, the city\r\nof _Yen_ was an important government, on account of the neighbourhood\r\nof the Tartars. Some time after the dynasty _Han_ several Tartar\r\nprinces _Sien pi_ made themselves masters of the country of _Yen_.\r\nDuring the dynasty of _Tang_ the city of _Yen_ was still a considerable\r\none. After the destruction of that dynasty the Tartars _Ki tan_[151]\r\nmade themselves masters of Tartary, and the provinces of _Chansy_,\r\n_Petcheli_, and _Leao tong_. Their power was formidable to the Chinese.\r\nTheir court was in the city of _Yen_, which they adorned and inlarged.\r\nThese Tartars had, like the Chinese emperors, tribunals; one for the\r\nmathematics, and another for history[152]. They had likewise some\r\nillustrious princes, and kept some correspondence with the Caliphs.\r\n\r\nThe Tartars _Nuntche_ destroyed the power of _Leao_. Their court was\r\nalso at _Yen_; and they made it as magnificent and large a city as\r\nPeking is now. The Mogol Tartars destroyed the empire of the _Nuntche_\r\nor _Kin_. Their court was at first at _Yen_; but the Tartar Mogol\r\nemperor _Koublay_ demolished that city, and built what is now called\r\n_King tching_: at least _King tching_ is a good part of the city built\r\nby _Koublay_, which was some _ly_ larger. The emperor’s palace was\r\nlikewise larger.\r\n\r\nThis city _King tching_ is that, which Marco Paulo calls _Cambalu_.\r\n_Car_ is _khan_, which signifies a _king_; and _balu_ is a corruption\r\nof an old Mogol word _balga_, or _balah_, which signifies a _city_:\r\nwhence is formed the word _balgasan_ in Mogol or Mongou, which\r\nsignifies city. _Khan balu_, or _khan balou_, signifies the royal\r\ncity. _King tching_, in the time of Marco Paulo, was the capital of\r\nthe empire of China. The Persians and Arabians, from the Mongou word\r\n_khan balou_, or _khan balgasun_, or _khan balga_, formed the word\r\n_khan balik_ or _khan balek_, which signifies also the royal city.\r\nThis name was given by the eastern people to the city of _Caifong\r\nfou_, the capital of _Honan_, and to that of _Nanking_, the capital of\r\n_Kiangnan_, at the time when these cities were the court of princes.\r\nThis name was also given to the cities of Tartary, when some powerful\r\nprinces kept sometimes their court there. What I have remarked\r\nconcerning the words _khan balik_, _khan balek_, _khan balga_, &c. is\r\nto be applied to the words _ordo balik_, _ordou balik_. _Ordo_, or\r\n_ordou_, or _orto_, signifies royal, imperial, in the Mogol or Mongou\r\nlanguage. So _ordou balik_ signifies a court, a royal city; and these\r\nwords are in fact the names of some old cities, where the Mogol or\r\nMongou kings kept their courts.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS _on_ Nº. 5, _Fan king tchang_; which is the place where the\r\nforeign classical books are kept.\r\n\r\n_Tchang_ signifies magazine, or large place, where any thing is\r\ncontained. _Fan_ signifies stranger or foreigner; and _king_ signifies\r\na classical book.\r\n\r\nThe Jews of _Caifong fou_, the capital of _Honan_, first told the\r\nJesuit missionaries, that they conceived, that the Hebrew Bible was\r\npreserved at Peking in the place called _Fan king tchang_. These first\r\nmissionaries neglected to make a search for it at Peking, or did not\r\nthink of it. But it did not escape the attention of Father Bouvet,\r\na French Jesuit, who went to _Fan king tchang_. The antient place,\r\nwhere the foreign books were kept, had been destroyed; and those books\r\nremoved into a neighbouring _miao_ where there were bonzes. Father\r\nBouvet went to this _miao_ with two other French Jesuits; but they\r\nfound only the Koran, fragments of the classical books of the Indians,\r\nand the classical books of the lamas; the whole in bad condition.\r\nFather Bouvet thought, that he saw in an old coffer Chaldee, Syriac,\r\nand Hebrew characters. The bonze would not shew the place, where Father\r\nBouvet thought that he had seen those characters, which, on returning\r\nto the _miao_, were not found. The emperor had ordered the bonzes\r\nto shew every thing to Father Bouvet. All the classical books were\r\nafterwards removed to the palace; the _miao_ was demolished; and there\r\nremained nothing but the name of _Fan king tchang_. When I passed thro’\r\n_Caifong fou_, the Jews, in the presence of Father Gozani, who served\r\nme as interpreter, assured me, that I should find the Bible in the _Fan\r\nking tchang_. These Jews had not been at Peking. What they said was in\r\nconsequence of what they had been told by old Jews, who were deceased.\r\nWhen I arrived at Peking, I made inquiries myself, and caused inquiries\r\nto be made by others; but I could not find the Bible. It is not yet an\r\nhundred years since there were at Peking some Jewish families; which\r\nafterwards turned Mahometans. A Mahometan, who was a man of parts,\r\nassured me several times, that the Bible was in the possession of the\r\nMahometans here, whose ancestors were Jews. But when, in consequence of\r\nwhat he said, inquiries were made, nothing was found. This Mahometan\r\ninformed me likewise, that he had made inquiries; but if he had done\r\nso, his researches proved unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS _on the_ Ti ouang miao, Nº. 217.\r\n\r\n1. The emperors, whose memory is honoured there, are\r\n\r\nThe emperors _Tou hi_, _Chin Nong_, _Hoang ti_.\r\n\r\nThe emperors _Chao hao_, _Tchouen hiu_, _Ty co_, _Yao_, _Chun_.\r\n\r\nThe emperor _Yu_, the founder of the dynasty _Hia_, and thirteen other\r\nemperors of that dynasty.\r\n\r\nThe emperor _Tching tang_, the founder of the dynasty _Chang_, and\r\ntwenty-five emperors of that dynasty.\r\n\r\nThe emperor _Ou ouang_, the founder of the dynasty _Tcheou_, and\r\nthirty-one emperors of that dynasty.\r\n\r\nThe founder of the dynasty _Han_, and twenty emperors of that dynasty,\r\nwho are called western _Han_, eastern _Han_, and later _Han_.\r\n\r\nThe founder of the dynasty _Tang_, and fourteen emperors of that\r\ndynasty.\r\n\r\nThe founder of the dynasty _Song_, and thirteen emperors of that\r\ndynasty; which is called the northern _Song_ and the southern _Song_.\r\n\r\n_Gen tchis khan_, or _Temoug in_, the founder of the dynasty _Yuen_,\r\nis the dynasty of the Mongol or Mogol Tartars. Besides the founder\r\nof this dynasty, there are ten other emperors of this dynasty, whose\r\nmemory is honoured in the _Ti ouang miao_. The four first emperors of\r\nthis dynasty, _viz. Gen tchis khan_, _Ogo tay_, _Kouey yevou_, and\r\n_Meng ko_, reigned in the northern provinces, and had not conquered all\r\nChina. The emperor _Cobilay_, or _Koublay_, in Chinese _Yuen chitsou_,\r\ncompleted the conquest of China.\r\n\r\nThe founder of the dynasty _Ming_, and the eleven emperors of this\r\ndynasty.\r\n\r\nThe emperor _Ogo tay_, the second of the dynasty _Yuen_, completed\r\nthe destruction of the dynasty of the eastern Tartars, called _Kin_.\r\nIt reigned to the north as long as the dynasty _Song_ reigned to the\r\nsouth. In the _Ti ouang miao_ is honoured the memory of the founder of\r\nthis dynasty _Kin_, and four other emperors of it.\r\n\r\nThe founder of the Tartar dynasty _Kin_ destroyed the dynasty of the\r\nTartars _Ki tan_, called _Leao_, which conquered a great part of North\r\nChina and Tartary.\r\n\r\nIn the _Ti ouang miao_ is honoured the memory of this Tartar dynasty\r\n_Leao_, and five other emperors of the Tartars _Ki tan_, whose country\r\nwas in that of Parin in Tartary, among the Mongou or Mogols.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Continuation of the Remarks on the_ Ti ouang miao.\r\n\r\n2. In the palace of Peking, and elsewhere, there are great halls, in\r\nwhich honours are paid to the memory of the deceased emperors of the\r\nreigning dynasty of the _Mantcheou_. The first and second emperor\r\nreigned in East Tartary. The emperor _Chun tchi_ began to reign in\r\nChina. If we reckon the present emperor in the number, there are six\r\nemperors _Mantcheou_. Father Couplet, and others, are mistaken in\r\nreckoning one more. This error was occasioned by the years of the\r\nreign of _Tay hong_, the second emperor, having had two names. Father\r\nCouplet, and others, took the two names of the years of the reign for\r\nthe name or title of the two emperors.\r\n\r\n3. In the _Ti ouang miao_ is honoured the memory of some illustrious\r\npersons in the different dynasties. The same is done in the hall, where\r\nhonour is paid to the memory of the deceased emperors _Montcheou_: and\r\nthere are there tablets for so many illustrious persons among those\r\nemperors.\r\n\r\n4. In the _Ti ouang miao_ are placed none of the emperors of the\r\ndynasty _Hin_ before Christ, nor any of those between the dynasties\r\n_Tang_ and _Han_, nor of those of the five small dynasties after that\r\nof _Tang_. Besides, in each dynasty there are some emperors, whose\r\ntablets are not placed in the _Ti ouang miao_. The reigning dynasty has\r\nnot thought it a duty to pay honours to those emperors, but considered\r\nthem as unworthy the pompous title of _Tin tse_, or _Sons of Heaven_.\r\n\r\n5. The Tartars _Sien pi_, who came from the confines of _Leao tong_ and\r\nMongol or Mogol Tartary, had hords named _To pa_. One of these hords\r\nmade themselves masters of Tartary _Leao tong_, and of several northern\r\nprovinces of China. This Tartar power has the Chinese name of _Ouey_.\r\nIt has produced several great princes. The year of Christ 386 is\r\nreckoned the first of that dynasty[153], which reigned above 180 years.\r\nI do not know why the reigning dynasty has not placed the name of any\r\nof these emperors in the _Ti ouang miao_.\r\n\r\n6. If we suppose, first, that all the books of the history of China\r\nshould be lost, or the contents of them should not be known in Europe;\r\nand secondly, that the catalogue of the emperors, who are mentioned\r\nin the _Ti ouang miao_, should fall into the hands of some European\r\ncritics; it is probable, that such a catalogue would occasion many\r\nfalse reasonings with relation to the succession of the emperors, who\r\nhave reigned in China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCVII. _An Attempt to improve the Manner of working the Ventilators by\r\nthe Help of the Fire-Engine. In a Letter to_ Tho. Birch, _D. D. Secret.\r\nR. S. from_ Keane Fitz-Gerald, _Esq; F.R.S._\r\n\r\n[Read June 8, 1758.]\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nTHE reverend and ingenious Dr. Hales, from whom mankind has received\r\nsuch benefit by his useful application of ventilators, being inclined\r\nto extend its use to those, who work in mines at great depths under\r\nground, where the lives of many are lost by damps and noxious vapours,\r\noccasioned by the want of a free circulation of air; and finding by\r\nexperience, that ventilators worked by wind do not operate above one\r\nthird part of the year, and in calm hot weather, when most wanted, do\r\nnot operate at all; did me the honour of applying to me for assistance\r\nin contriving a machine to work the ventilator, by the help of the\r\nfire-engine, which is now generally used in all mines for drawing off\r\nthe water; and which I have accordingly attempted, and hope it will\r\nanswer the purpose.\r\n\r\nAs the lever of the fire-engine works up and down alternately, and\r\nperforms at a common medium about a dozen strokes in a minute, it\r\nwas necessary to contrive some way to make the beam, tho’ moving\r\nalternately, to turn a wheel constantly round one way, and also to\r\nincrease the number of strokes to fifty or sixty in a minute.\r\n\r\nThe model of a machine for this purpose is composed of four wheels of\r\ndifferent sizes, two clicks, three pinions, and a fly; which is put\r\ninto motion by the part of a wheel fixed to the arch of the lever of\r\nthe fire-engine.\r\n\r\nThe wheel, which is turned by the lever, or rather moved up and down\r\nby it, is loose on its arbor; and likewise one of the rochets, and the\r\nwheel next to it. The outside rochet and outside wheel are fixed on the\r\narbor.\r\n\r\nThere are two pinion-wheels fixed on the arbor; one on each side, near\r\nthe edge of the wheel moved by the lever, which turns them.\r\n\r\nThere are also two clicks; one fixed to the great wheel, the other to\r\nthe frame. These exclusive of the wheel that moves the fly.\r\n\r\nThe effect is, When the lever moves the wheel downwards, its click\r\nforces the rochet fixed on the arbor to move along with it, and the\r\nother wheels the same way. When it moves upwards, the click fixed on\r\nthe frame stops the larger rochet, and the wheel next to it, which are\r\npinned together. This wheel being stopped, and the great wheel carried\r\nupwards by the lever, the pinion towards the edge of the great wheel\r\nis forced round it, and moves the pinion on the other side the great\r\nwheel; which pinion moves the wheel fixed on the arbor, the contrary\r\nway to the great wheel, which is carried upwards by the lever. By which\r\nmeans, the arbor is constantly turned the same way, when the lever of\r\nthe fire-engine is moved either upwards, or downwards.\r\n\r\nUpon the arbor there is also another great wheel fixed, which turns\r\na pinion: on the arbor of which pinion is a crank to move the\r\nventilator, and also a fly fixed to the end, to help the motion of the\r\ncrank, which in the model is turned three times for each stroke of the\r\nlever, and may be increased or diminished, according to the number of\r\nteeth in the pinion.\r\n\r\nThe number of teeth in the great wheel moved by the lever is sixty-six;\r\nbut need not have teeth above half way round.\r\n\r\nThe wheel fixed to the rochet has thirty-three teeth, and its pinion\r\neleven.\r\n\r\nThe wheel fixed on the arbor, on the outside, has twenty-four teeth,\r\nand its pinion sixteen.\r\n\r\nThe wheel, which turns the fly, has ninety teeth, and the pinion turn’d\r\nby this wheel ten.\r\n\r\nThe greater the number of teeth in the rochets, the better.\r\n\r\nThis machine may also be applied to other useful purposes at mines; and\r\nit may be easily made to turn a mill to grind corn; or to turn a wheel\r\nto raise coals, or whatever else is wanted to be raised from the mines.\r\nAs I have not met with any thing of the kind described, I take the\r\nliberty of desiring you to lay it before the Society; and I hope it may\r\nbe made some way useful to the public.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir,\r\n\r\n                  Your most obedient humble Servant,\r\n                           Kea. Fitz-Gerald.\r\n\r\nPoland-Street, June 7th, 1758.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Explanation of the Three Tables._\r\n\r\nThe wheel A (_Tab. 26._), which is turned by the lever B (_Tab. 27._),\r\nor rather moved up and down by it, is loose on its arbor; and likewise\r\none of the rochets C (_Tab. 26._), and the wheel next to it D. The\r\noutside rochet E, and outside wheel F, are fixed on the arbor.\r\n\r\nThere are two pinion-wheels G and H fixed on one arbor; one on each\r\nside, near the edge of the wheel A, moved by the lever.\r\n\r\nThere are also two clicks _a_ and _b_; one _a_ fixed to the great wheel\r\nA, the other _b_ fixed to the frame. These exclusive of the wheel I,\r\nthat moves the pinion _c_, on the arbor of which, the crank _d_, and\r\nfly _e_, (_Tab. 27._) are fixed.\r\n\r\nThe effect is, when the lever B moves the wheel A downwards; its click\r\n_a_, forces the rochet E, fixed on the arbor K, to move along with it,\r\nand the other wheels the same way. When it moves upwards, the click _b_\r\nfixed to the frame, stops the larger rochet C, and the wheel D next to\r\nit, which are pinned together; and as the wheel A is carried upwards\r\nby the lever, the pinion G towards the edge of it, is forced round the\r\nwheel D, and moves the pinion H, on the other side the great wheel A,\r\nwhich moves the wheel F fixed on the arbor K, the contrary way to the\r\nwheel A. By which means, the arbor K is constantly turned the same way,\r\nwhen the lever of the fire-engine moves either upwards, or downwards.\r\n\r\nThe pinion G, by being made proportionally smaller than the pinion H,\r\nkeeps the arbor K in the same swiftness of motion, when the lever is\r\nmoved upwards, as downwards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Philos.

The pinion _c_, is turned three\r\ntimes by each alternate motion of the lever; which may be increased, or\r\ndiminished, according to the number of teeth in the pinion _c_.\r\n\r\nThe number of teeth in the wheel A is sixty-six, but need not be\r\ntoothed above half way. Instead of this wheel there might be a barrel,\r\nwith a chord round it, fixed at each end of the arch of the lever, and\r\nprojecting somewhat from it; which, by the motion of the lever, would\r\nwork in the same manner in other respects, and be easier made, and at\r\nless expence.\r\n\r\nThe wheel D fixed to the rochet C has thirty-three teeth, and its\r\npinion G eleven.\r\n\r\nThe wheel F fixed on the arbor K has twenty-four teeth, and its pinion\r\nH sixteen.\r\n\r\nThe greater the number of teeth in the rochets, the better.\r\n\r\n_Tab. 26._ contains the plan (in parts) of the whole machine, except\r\nthe lever B and fly _e_, which are in _Tab. 27._\r\n\r\n_Tab. 27._ also contains the elevation of the arbor, with its different\r\nfixtures; _viz._\r\n\r\n_Fig. 1._ The rochet C and wheel D (_Tab. 26._) fixed together.\r\n\r\n      2.

By Mr._ John Dollond. _With a Letter from_\r\nJames Short, _M. A. F.R.S. Acad. Reg. Suec. Soc._\r\n\r\n[Read June 8, 1758.]\r\n\r\n               _To the Rev. Dr._ Birch, _Secret. R. S._\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI Have received the inclosed paper from Mr. Dollond, which he desires\r\nmay be laid before the Royal Society. It contains the theory of\r\ncorrecting the errors arising from the different refrangibility of\r\nthe rays of light in the object-glasses of refracting telescopes; and\r\nI have found, upon examination, that telescopes made according to\r\nthis theory are intirely free from colours, and are as distinct as\r\nreflecting telescopes. I am,\r\n\r\n                               Dear Sir,\r\n                  Your most obedient humble Servant,\r\n                              Ja. Short.\r\n\r\nSurrey-street, 8th June, 1758.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is well known, that a ray of light, refracted by passing thro’\r\nmediums of different densities, is at the same time proportionally\r\ndivided or spread into a number of parts, commonly called homogeneal\r\nrays, each of a different colour; and that these, after refraction,\r\nproceed diverging; a proof, that they are differently refracted, and\r\nthat light consists of parts that differ in degrees of refrangibility.\r\n\r\nEvery ray of light passing from a rarer into a denser medium, is\r\nrefracted towards the perpendicular; but from a denser into a rarer\r\none, from the perpendicular; and the sines of the angles of incidence\r\nand refraction are in a given ratio. But light consisting of parts,\r\nwhich are differently refrangible, each part of an original or compound\r\nray has a ratio peculiar to itself; and therefore the more a heterogene\r\nray is refracted, the more will the colours diverge, since the ratios\r\nof the sines of the homogene rays are constant; and equal refractions\r\nproduce equal divergencies.\r\n\r\nThat this is the case when light is refracted by one given medium only,\r\nas suppose any particular sort of glass, is out of all dispute, being\r\nindeed self-evident; but that the divergency of the colours will be\r\nthe same under equal refractions, whatsoever mediums the light may be\r\nrefracted by, tho’ generally supposed, does not appear quite so clearly.\r\n\r\nHowever, as no medium is known, which will refract light without\r\ndiverging the colours, and as difference of refrangibility seems thence\r\nto be a property inherent in light itself, Opticians have, upon that\r\nconsideration, concluded, that equal refractions must produce equal\r\ndivergencies in every sort of medium: whence it should also follow,\r\nthat equal and contrary refractions must not only destroy each other,\r\nbut that the divergency of the colour from one refraction would\r\nlikewise be corrected by the other; and there could be no possibility\r\nof producing any such thing as refraction, which would not be affected\r\nby the different refrangibility of light; or, in other words, that\r\nhowever a ray of light might be refracted backwards and forwards by\r\ndifferent mediums, as water, glass, _&c._ provided it was so done, that\r\nthe emergent ray should be parallel to the incident one, it would ever\r\nafter be white; and, conversely, if it should come out inclined to the\r\nincident, it would diverge, and ever after be coloured. From which it\r\nwas natural to infer, that all spherical object-glasses of telescopes\r\nmust be equally affected by the different refrangibility of light, in\r\nproportion to their apertures, whatever material they may be formed of.\r\n\r\nBut it seems worthy of consideration, that notwithstanding this notion\r\nhas been generally adopted as an incontestable truth, yet it does not\r\nseem to have been hitherto so confirmed by evident experiment, as the\r\nnature of so important a matter justly demands; and this it was that\r\ndetermined me to attempt putting the thing to issue by the following\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nI cemented together two plates of parallel glass at their edges, so as\r\nto form a prismatic or wedge-like vessel, when stopped at the ends or\r\nbases; and its edge being turned downwards, I placed therein a glass\r\nprism with one of its edges upwards, and filled up the vacancy with\r\nclear water: thus the refraction of the prism was contrived to be\r\ncontrary to that of the water, so that a ray of light transmitted thro’\r\nboth these refracting mediums would be refracted by the difference only\r\nbetween the two refractions. Wherefore, as I found the water to refract\r\nmore or less than the glass prism, I diminished or increased the angle\r\nbetween the glass plates, till I found the two contrary refractions to\r\nbe equal; which I discovered by viewing an object thro’ this double\r\nprism; which, when it appeared neither raised nor depressed, I was\r\nsatisfied, that the refractions were equal, and that the emergent rays\r\nwere parallel to the incident.\r\n\r\nNow, according to the prevailing opinion, the object should have\r\nappeared thro’ this double prism quite of its natural colour; for\r\nif the difference of refrangibility had been equal in the two equal\r\nrefractions, they would have rectified each other: but the experiment\r\nfully proved the fallacy of this received opinion, by shewing the\r\ndivergency of the light by the prism to be almost double of that by\r\nthe water; for the object, tho’ not at all refracted, was yet as much\r\ninfected with prismatic colours, as if it had been seen thro’ a glass\r\nwedge only, whose refracting angle was near 30 degrees.\r\n\r\n  _N. B._ This experiment will be readily perceived to be the same as\r\n  that which Sir Isaac Newton mentions[154]; but how it comes to differ\r\n  so very remarkably in the result, I shall not take upon me to account\r\n  for; but will only add, that I used all possible precaution and care\r\n  in the process, and that I keep the apparatus by me to evince the\r\n  truth of what I write, whenever I may be properly required so to do.\r\n\r\nI plainly saw then, that if the refracting angle of the water-vessel\r\ncould have admitted of a sufficient increase, the divergency of\r\nthe coloured rays would have been greatly diminished, or intirely\r\nrectified; and there would have been a very great refraction without\r\ncolour, as now I had a great discolouring without refraction: but the\r\ninconveniency of so large an angle, as that of the vessel must have\r\nbeen, to bring the light to an equal divergency with that of the glass\r\nprism, whose angle was about 60 degrees, made it necessary to try some\r\nexperiments of the same kind, by smaller angles.\r\n\r\nI ground a wedge of common plate glass to an angle of somewhat less\r\nthan 9 degrees, which refracted the mean rays about 5 degrees. I then\r\nmade a wedge-like vessel, as in the former experiment, and filling it\r\nwith water, managed it so, that it refracted equally with the glass\r\nwedge; or, in other words, the difference of their refractions was\r\nnothing, and objects viewed thro’ them appeared neither raised nor\r\ndepressed. This was done with an intent to observe the same thing over\r\nagain in these small angles, which I had seen in the prism: and it\r\nappeared indeed the same in proportion, or as near as I could judge;\r\nfor notwithstanding the refractions were here also equal, yet the\r\ndivergency of the colours by the glass was vastly greater than that\r\nby the water; for objects seen by these two refractions were very\r\nmuch discoloured. Now this was a demonstration, that the divergency\r\nof the light, by the different refrangibility, was far from being\r\nequal in these two refractions. I also saw, from the position of the\r\ncolours, that the excess of divergency was in the glass; so that I\r\nincreased the angle of the water-wedge, by different trials, till the\r\ndivergency of the light by the water was equal to that by the glass;\r\nthat is, till the object, tho’ considerably refracted, by the excess\r\nof the refraction of the water, appeared nevertheless quite free from\r\nany colours proceeding from the different refrangibility of light;\r\nand, as near as I could then measure, the refraction by the water was\r\nabout ⁵⁄₄ of that by the glass. Indeed I was not very exact in taking\r\nthe measures, because my business was not at that time about the\r\nproportions, so much as to shew, that the divergency of the colours, by\r\ndifferent substances, was by no means in proportion to the refractions;\r\nand that there was a possibility of refraction without any divergency\r\nof the light at all.\r\n\r\nHaving, about the beginning of the year 1757, tried these experiments,\r\nI soon after set about grinding telescopic object-glasses upon the\r\nnew principles of refractions, which I had gathered from them;\r\nwhich object-glasses were compounded of two spherical glasses with\r\nwater between them. These glasses I had the satisfaction to find,\r\nas I had expected, free from the errors arising from the different\r\nrefrangibility of light: for the refractions, by which the rays were\r\nbrought to a focus, were every-where the differences between two\r\ncontrary refractions, in the same manner, and in the same proportions,\r\nas in the experiment with the wedges.\r\n\r\nHowever, the images formed at the foci of these object-glasses were\r\nstill very far from being so distinct as might have been expected\r\nfrom the removal of so great a disturbance; and yet it was not very\r\ndifficult to guess at the reason, when I considered, that the radii of\r\nthe spherical surfaces of those glasses were required to be so short,\r\nin order to make the refractions in the required proportions, that\r\nthey must produce aberrations, or errors, in the image, as great, or\r\ngreater, than those from the different refrangibility of light. And\r\ntherefore, seeing no method of getting over that difficulty, I gave up\r\nall hopes of succeeding in that way.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, as these experiments clearly proved, that different substances\r\ndiverged the light very differently, in proportion to the refraction;\r\nI began to suspect, that such variety might possibly be found in\r\ndifferent sorts of glass, especially as experience had already shewn,\r\nthat some made much better object-glasses, in the usual way, than\r\nothers: and as no satisfactory cause had as yet been assigned for such\r\ndifference, there was great reason to presume, that it might be owing\r\nto the different divergency of the light by their refractions.\r\n\r\nWherefore, the next business to be undertaken, was to grind wedges\r\nof different kinds of glass, and apply them together, so that the\r\nrefractions might be made in contrary directions, in order to discover,\r\nas in the foregoing experiments, whether the refraction and divergency\r\nof the colours would vanish together. But a considerable time elapsed\r\nbefore I could set about that work; for tho’ I was determined to try\r\nit at my leisure, for satisfying my own curiosity, yet I did not\r\nexpect to meet with a difference sufficient to give room for any great\r\nimprovement of telescopes; so that it was not till the latter end of\r\nthe year that I undertook it, when my first trials convinced me, that\r\nthis business really deserved my utmost attention and application.\r\n\r\nI discovered a difference, far beyond my hopes, in the refractive\r\nqualities of different kinds of glass, with respect to their divergency\r\nof colours. the yellow or straw-coloured foreign sort, commonly called\r\nVenice glass, and the English crown glass, are very near alike in that\r\nrespect, tho’ in general the crown glass seems to diverge the light\r\nrather the least of the two. The common plate glass made in England\r\ndiverges more; and the white crystal or flint English glass, as it is\r\ncalled, most of all.\r\n\r\nIt was not now my business to examine into the particular qualities of\r\nevery kind of glass that I could come at, much less to amuse myself\r\nwith conjectures about the cause, but to fix upon such two sorts\r\nas their difference was the greatest; which I soon found to be the\r\ncrown, and the white flint or crystal. I therefore ground a wedge of\r\nwhite flint of about 25 degrees, and another of crown of about 29\r\ndegrees, which refracted nearly alike; but their divergency of the\r\ncolours was very different. I then ground several others of crown to\r\ndifferent angles, till I got one, which was equal, with respect to the\r\ndivergency of the light, to that in the white flint: for when they were\r\nput together, so as to refract in contrary directions, the refracted\r\nlight was intirely free from colour. Then measuring the refractions\r\nof each wedge, I found that of the white glass to be to that of the\r\ncrown nearly as 2 to 3; and this proportion would hold very nearly in\r\nall small angles. Wherefore any two wedges made in this proportion,\r\nand applied together, so as to refract in a contrary direction, would\r\nrefract the light without any difference of refrangibility.\r\n\r\nTo make therefore two spherical glasses, that shall refract the light\r\nin contrary directions, it is easy to understand, that one must be\r\nconcave, and the other convex; and as the rays are to converge to a\r\nreal focus, the excess of refraction must evidently be in the convex;\r\nand as the convex is to refract most, it appears from the experiment,\r\nthat it must be made with crown glass, and the concave with white flint\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nAnd further, as the refractions of spherical glasses are in an inverse\r\nratio of their focal distances; it follows, that the focal distances\r\nof the two glasses should be inversely as the ratio’s of the fractions\r\nof the wedges: for being thus proportioned, every ray of light, that\r\npasses thro’ this combined glass, at whatever distance it may pass from\r\nits axe, will constantly be refracted, by the difference between two\r\ncontrary refractions, in the proportion required; and therefore the\r\ndifferent refrangibility of the light will be intirely removed.\r\n\r\nHaving thus got rid of the principal cause of the imperfection of\r\nrefracting telescopes, there seemed to be nothing more to do, but to go\r\nto work upon this principle: but I had not made many attempts, before\r\nI found, that the removal of one impediment had introduced another\r\nequally detrimental (the same as I had before found in two glasses with\r\nwater between them): for the two glasses, that were to be combined\r\ntogether, were the segments of very deep spheres; and therefore the\r\naberrations from the spherical surfaces became very considerable, and\r\ngreatly disturbed the distinctness of the image. Tho’ this appeared\r\nat first a very great difficulty, yet I was not long without hopes\r\nof a remedy: for considering, the surfaces of spherical glasses admit\r\nof great variations, tho’ the focal distance be limited, and that by\r\nthese variations their aberrations may be made more or less, almost at\r\npleasure; I plainly saw the possibility of making the aberrations of\r\nany two glasses equal; and as in this case the refractions of the two\r\nglasses were contrary to each other, their aberrations, being equal,\r\nwould intirely vanish.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, at last, I obtained a perfect theory for making\r\nobject-glasses, to the apertures of which I could scarce conceive any\r\nlimits: for if the practice could come up to the theory, they must\r\ncertainly admit of very extensive ones, and of course bear very great\r\nmagnifying powers.\r\n\r\nBut the difficulties attending the practice are very considerable.\r\nIn the first place, the focal distances, as well as the particular\r\nsurfaces, must be very nicely proportioned to the densities or\r\nrefracting powers of the glasses; which are very apt to vary in the\r\nsame sort of glass made at different times. Secondly, the centres\r\nof the two glasses must be placed truly on the common axis of the\r\ntelescope, otherwise the desired effect will be in a great measure\r\ndestroyed. Add to these, that there are four surfaces to be wrought\r\nperfectly spherical; and any person, but moderately practised in\r\noptical operations, will allow, that there must be the greatest\r\naccuracy throughout the whole work.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding so many difficulties, as I have enumerated, I have,\r\nafter numerous trials, and a resolute perseverance, brought the matter\r\nat last to such an issue, that I can construct refracting telescopes,\r\nwith such apertures and magnifying powers, under limited lengths, as,\r\nin the opinion of the best and undeniable judges, who have experienced\r\nthem, far exceed any thing that has been hitherto produced, as\r\nrepresenting objects with great distinctness, and in their true colours.\r\n\r\n                                                          John Dollond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCIX. _An Account of some extraordinary Effects arising from\r\nConvulsions; being Part of a Letter to_ John Huxham, _M.D. and F.R.S.\r\nfrom_ William Watson, _M.D. F.R.S._\r\n\r\n                                                          6 June, 1758.\r\n\r\n[Read June 15, 1758.]\r\n\r\nIN the month of January 1757, I was concerned for a young gentle-woman,\r\nwho, if the number, continuance, and frequency of their returns,\r\nbe considered, suffered the most violent and severe convulsions I\r\never knew. At some times the muscular spasms were general; at other\r\ntimes single muscles only, or a number of them, subservient to some\r\nparticular purpose in the animal oeconomy, were affected. And such\r\nwas the peculiarity of this case, that after and in proportion as\r\nany single muscle, or any determined number of muscles, had been in\r\na state of spasm, a paralytic inability succeeded to those muscles,\r\nwhich very much disordered and impaired, and several times even for no\r\nsmall continuance prevented the patient from performing, several of\r\nher necessary functions. When the muscles, for instance, subservient to\r\ndeglutition had been convulsed, for many hours after the fits had left\r\nher, she has not been able to swallow a single drop of liquid: so that\r\nwhen attempts have been made to cause her to drink, unless the liquor\r\nwas immediately thrown back, there was imminent danger of her being\r\nstrangled. When her eyes have been affected, several times a compleat\r\n_gutta serena_, and total blindness, has ensued; the patient being able\r\nto bear the strong day-light with open eyes, without being sensible of\r\nits influence, or in the least contracting her widely dilated pupils.\r\nAfter one of these fits the blindness continued full five days; and I\r\nbegan to be in fear for the return of her sight.\r\n\r\nYou, Sir, who are so excellently well versed in the animal oeconomy,\r\nare not to be informed, that vocification is performed in the _aspera\r\narteria_; but that the articulation of sounds into syllables and words\r\nis modulated principally by the tongue, and muscles about the larynx.\r\nIn the case before you, very early in the disease, the spasms seized\r\nthe muscles about the larynx: the consequence of which was, that after\r\nthey were over, the patient was unable to utter a word. This faculty\r\nhowever she again once recovered; but it continued a very short time,\r\nas the fits returned, which again left her deprived of the power\r\nof speech. After having lost her voice a second time, her power of\r\nspeech did not return, even after she was freed from her convulsions,\r\nand her general health restored. Fourteen months passed, whilst this\r\npatient continued absolutely speechless; when, after having violently\r\nheated herself by four hours dancing, on a sudden her power of speech\r\nreturned, and it has continued perfectly free ever since.\r\n\r\nWhat is still further remarkable in this case is, that during the whole\r\ntime of this patient’s continuing speechless, her life was rendered yet\r\nmore uncomfortable by her having, from the injury to her brain by the\r\nspasms, forgot how to write, so as to express her meaning that way: but\r\nupon the recovery of her speech, this faculty likewise returned, which\r\nshe has retained ever since. During the severity of this disease, which\r\ncontinued several weeks, almost every day of which, from the number\r\nand violence of the convulsions, I feared would be the patient’s last,\r\nnothing was left unattempted, which I imagined could tend to prevent\r\nthe return of the spasms, or lessen their effects. My endeavours so far\r\nhappily succeeded, that her fits did not return; but the consequences\r\nof them continued, more particularly her inability to speak. After some\r\nmonths however, when she was recruited in her strength, I was desirous\r\nof trying the effects of electricity, more particularly applied about\r\nher throat. This was accordingly attempted; but such was the state of\r\nher nerves, and their sensibility to its effects, that electrizing\r\nbrought back the fits, which again affected her sight: so that I was\r\ncompelled to desist, lest, in endeavouring to restore her speech, I\r\nmight not only fail in this attempt, but might bring possibly on a\r\npermanent blindness. I determined therefore to trust the whole to time,\r\nwhich has happily removed all her complaints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC. _An Account of an extraordinary Storm of Hail in_ Virginia. _By_\r\nFrancis Fauquier, _Esq; Lieutenant Governor of_ Virginia, _and F.R.S.\r\nCommunicated by_ William Fauquier, _Esq; F.R.S._\r\n\r\n_To the Rev._ Tho.

It was a\r\nsmall cloud, that did not seem to threaten much before its breaking,\r\nand did not extend a full mile in breadth. It passed over the middle of\r\nthe town of Williamsburgh, and the skirts of the town had but little of\r\nit. Its course was from N. by W. to S. by E. The hail-stones, or rather\r\npieces of ice, were most of them of an oblong square form; many of them\r\nan inch and half long, and about three fourths of an inch wide and\r\ndeep; and from one side of most of them there proceeded sharp spikes,\r\nprotuberant at least half an inch. He says he cooled his wine, and\r\nfroze cream, with some of them the next day; and they were not totally\r\ndissolved when he went to bed on Monday night. This storm broke every\r\npane of glass on the north side his house, and destroyed all his garden\r\nthings intirely.\r\n\r\nHe mentions likewise the heats to have been rather more than usual in\r\nthat country this summer; and particularly on the 9th of August his\r\nthermometer (which is hung on the outside of his house on the north\r\naspect) was at 97, by Fahrenheit’s graduation, and some other days as\r\nhigh as 94 or 95.

By_ Daniel Peter Layard, _M. D. F.R.S._\r\n\r\n[Read Nov. 9. 1758.]\r\n\r\n                                            Huntingdon, 20th May, 1758.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nIN October 1755. I communicated to you, and you inserted in the last\r\nvolume of your _Journal Britannique_, the case of Susannah Earle, of\r\nHemmingford-Grey in this County, who, in consequence of the whooping\r\ncough, was afflicted with a protruded eye. The case I now send you,\r\nsomewhat similar to that young girl’s in its first appearance and\r\nprogress, but by accident attended with a second disease, will perhaps\r\ndeserve your attention, and not seem unworthy of being presented to\r\nthe Royal Society.\r\n\r\nJohn Law, of Fenny-Stanton, also in the County of Huntingdon, a strong\r\nand robust lad, thirteen years and six months old, in Easter week\r\n1756, beating dung about a close with unusual force, on a sudden felt\r\na violent pain in his left eye. The pain increased, an inflammation\r\nensued, and the eye grew daily larger. The poor boy’s mother followed\r\nthe directions, which she received, without the least benefit to her\r\nchild, after having, besides other expences, been defrauded by a quack\r\nof two guineas; a great sum for a poor cottager!\r\n\r\nThe widow Law, in her distress, heard of Susannah Earl’s cure. She\r\nwent to see her; and determined to bring her son to Huntingdon, for\r\nMr. Hopkins’s assistance. Accordingly, October the 7th 1756, she came\r\nto Mr. Daniel Hopkins, surgeon, in this town; and having desired my\r\nopinion, we both examined the eye together.\r\n\r\nThe left eye was protruded out of its orbit, and hung down over the\r\ncheek to the upper lip. The coats were greatly discoloured, all the\r\nvessels turgid, the sight totally lost, and the humours appeared like\r\nfluctuating pus. We saw the necessity of an immediate extirpation, to\r\nsave the right eye, already greatly inflamed; and having apprized the\r\nmother and boy of the state the eye was in, a consultation was desired\r\nwith two surgeons of St. Ives. Mr. Dawkes, who was present with Mr.\r\nSkeeles at Susannah Earle’s operation, being dead since that time, Mr.\r\nThomas Skeeles and Mr. Thomas Want very charitably met Mr. Hopkins and\r\nme the next day, October the 8th, at the widow Law’s cottage.\r\n\r\nThe eye appeared to these gentlemen as I have related: and upon Mr.\r\nWant’s pressing with his finger on the pupil, the globe burst at the\r\nedge of the _Iris_, and discharged pus. The extirpation of the eye was\r\nunanimously agreed upon, and immediately performed.\r\n\r\nMr. Hopkins made a puncture with a lancet close to the external and\r\nsmall canthus of the eye, and then with a pair of crooked scissars took\r\noff all the distended globe close to the eye-lids. He then cleaned the\r\ncavity of the purulent humours, and filled it with soft lint, over\r\nwhich he applied bolsters dipped in warm red wine and water, and the\r\n_monoculus_ bandage to keep on the whole dressings. The lad was bled\r\nin the arm; nitrous medicines, and anodynes, were prescribed, and a\r\nsuitable regimen. The fever, and inflammation of the eye, gradually\r\ndecreased; the suppuration of the wound in few days was good, the\r\ndistended eye-lids contracted, and a cure was soon expected.\r\n\r\nBut on November the 7th the lad went to open the street-door, and\r\nit being a cold and rainy evening, he quickly felt the bad effects\r\nof the cold wind, which drove the rain in upon him. That night the\r\nwound became again very painful, the eye-lids puffed up, and next\r\nday appeared much inflamed, as were all the contents of the orbit.\r\nFungous excrescences soon followed, and an intermittent fever. An\r\nemetic being improper, he was purged with rhubarb, and afterwards took\r\nthe bark infused in red wine. The fever was removed after some time;\r\nbut the contents of the orbit continued increasing, and the fungous\r\nexcrescences became so large and spongy, as to be of equal bulk with\r\nthe diseased eye before extirpation. All topical applications, to\r\ncontract this fungus, were ineffectual, and the application of caustics\r\nor escharotics was prudently avoided, lest they should produce a\r\ncarcinomatous ulcer. The discharge was chiefly a purulent serum: on\r\nwhich account, ever since the beginning of November he was kept upon a\r\ndry diet.\r\n\r\nIn February 1757. the remaining coats of the eye began to appear at\r\nthe most prominent parts of the excrescence, and seemed white like a\r\npart of the _conjunctiva_. On touching it with the finger, a distinct\r\nfluctuation was felt, and an _hydrophthalmia_ perfectly discovered; but\r\nneither the thickness of the coats, nor the sensibility of the parts,\r\nwould permit a puncture to be made, till the cyst, which appeared\r\nformed by the distension of one of the coats of the eye, was freer from\r\nthe fungus.\r\n\r\nThe cyst continued daily to extend itself, and to separate the fungous\r\nedges; the fluctuation became more manifest, and the membranes thinner.\r\nAt length, on the 15th of June 1757, Mr. Hopkins opened the cyst\r\nwith the point of a lancet, and let out a large cup-full of limpid\r\nserum, without smell or taste. The boy felt very little pain in this\r\noperation. The cavity was filled with dry lint, and compresses dipt in\r\nwarm red wine and water were applied over it. All the night following,\r\nand several days after, a great discharge of serum came away. On the\r\n19th the fungus was considerably lessened. Mr. Hopkins then dressed\r\nthe wound with warm _unguentum é gummi elemi_, and washed the fungus\r\nwith a lotion of _aquarum calcis_, _rosarum_, _et tincturæ myrrhæ_.\r\nOn the 23d, upon his removing the dressings, he saw the cyst loose\r\nand collapsed; which he extracted with his forceps, without the least\r\ndifficulty, or pain to his patient. The fungus daily wasted afterwards,\r\nthe wound digested well, and the lad was intirely cured on the 7th of\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\nHis right eye is perfectly strong, and he has been free from complaint\r\never since. The remainder of the coats of the eye, and of the muscles,\r\nbear up the eye-lids, that when uncovered he only seems to have closed\r\nthe left eye: however, he has wore all the winter a back patch over it,\r\nto guard against fresh cold.\r\n\r\nThe cyst, when first taken away, measured three inches and half in\r\nlength, one inch and half in diameter, and contained a large cup-full\r\nof water. It appeared to be the _tunica sclerotica_, was of a clear\r\npellucid white, and of so delicate a texture, as scarce to admit of\r\nbeing touched without tearing; and when dried with all possible care,\r\nbecame so brittle, that Mr. Hopkins could hardly preserve it in the\r\nmanner I now send it.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\nIn both Susannah Earle and John Law’s cases, the eye was distended by\r\nthe accumulation of the aqueous humour, separated in great quantity\r\nby the repeated straining of the blood-vessels in the whooping cough,\r\nwhich might gradually relax and enlarge the aqueous ducts of Susannah\r\nEarle’s eye; and possibly by the rupture of those ducts, and of some\r\nblood-vessels, at the time John Law exerted himself violently in\r\nbeating dung about the close: for in either case the _impetus_ of the\r\nblood must have been so violent, as to produce those effects. However,\r\nfrom the _hydrophthalmia_ succeeding the operation on John Law, the\r\nfungous excrescence, and continual serous discharge during several\r\nmonths from the wound, it plainly appears, that an abundance of aqueous\r\nhumour was discharged at first by the distention or laceration of the\r\naqueous ducts, and latterly for want of a contraction of those vessels,\r\nand of the lymphatics, which were no longer of use.\r\n\r\nBoth these cases shew the necessity of inquiring particularly into\r\nthe causes of diseases of the eyes, as well as of other parts of the\r\nbody; for by barely attending to the symptoms, the disease will not\r\nbe removed, tho’ the symptoms be alleviated. Bleeding, and moderate\r\nevacuations, would certainly have, at first, decreased the tension and\r\npain, and assuaged the inflammation; but both topical applications, and\r\ninternal medicines, were properly to be adapted, and a suitable diet\r\nregulated.\r\n\r\nNot to mention the absurd and impertinent abuse of empirics, what\r\nbenefit could accrue, in both these cases, from unctuous, laxative,\r\nor emollient applications, from drastic and mercurial purges? Tho’\r\nsuch applications might be well intended, to take off the tension\r\nand inflammation; yet, as the distension of the blood-vessels only\r\nincreased gradually, as the globe of the eye was enlarged; so whatever\r\napplication relaxed the coats of the eye, must infallibly stretch out\r\nthe vessels yet farther, and cause a greater pain and inflammation;\r\nwhich drastic and mercurial purges would also increase.\r\n\r\nThe only method then to be pursued in such bad cases would be at first\r\nto endeavour to remove the fullness of the blood, and make use of such\r\ntopical remedies as would contract without irritation. If the cause\r\nremains, as the whooping cough in Susannah Earle’s case, no amendment\r\nof the eye can be expected, while the patient’s blood-vessels are\r\ncontinually strained by frequent coughing. This illness therefore\r\nshould be attended to, and removed as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nBut should the eye be so enlarged, as to protrude itself out of the\r\norbit, there seems no other way to lessen the bulk of the eye, than\r\nby making a puncture with a proper instrument, to let out the aqueous\r\nhumour; and then apply such agglutinant and contracting _collyria_, as\r\nmay reduce the distended coats and vessels to their former size. This\r\noperation should be performed before the humours are vitiated, the\r\nsight lost, the vessels in a state of suppuration, and the coats of the\r\neye too far extended; for at that time nothing less than extirpation\r\ncan be of use.\r\n\r\nProfessor Nuck, in his _Tractatus de Ductibus Oculorum Aquosis_, p.\r\n120, _& seq._ relates the success he had in curing a young man by five\r\nrepeated punctures, and a strict observance in a proper use of all the\r\nnon-naturals.\r\n\r\nI am, with the greatest regard and esteem,\r\n\r\n                               Dear Sir,\r\n                    Your most affectionate Brother,\r\n                       and very humble Servant,\r\n                             D. P. Layard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCII. _An Account of the Heat of the Weather in_ Georgia: _In a Letter\r\nfrom his Excellency_ Henry Ellis, _Esq; Governor of_ Georgia, _and\r\nF.R.S. to_ John Ellis, _Esq; F.R.S._\r\n\r\n[Read Nov. 16, 1758.]\r\n\r\n                                                Georgia, 17 July, 1758.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nTHO’ some weeks have passed since I wrote to you, yet so little\r\nalteration has happened in the state of our affairs, that nothing\r\noccurs to me relative to them worth committing to paper. This indeed\r\nI need not regret, as one cannot sit down to any thing, that requires\r\nmuch application, but with extreme reluctance; for such is the\r\ndebilitating quality of our violent heats at this season, that an\r\ninexpressible languor enervates every faculty, and renders even the\r\nthought of exercising them painful.\r\n\r\n’Tis now about three o’ clock; the sun bears nearly S. W. and I am\r\nwriting in a piazza, open at each end, on the north-east side of my\r\nhouse, perfectly in the shade: a small breeze at S. E. blows freely\r\nthro’ it; no buildings are nearer, to reflect the heat, than 60 yards:\r\nyet in a thermometer hanging by me, made by Mr. Bird, and compared by\r\nthe late Mr. George Graham with an approved one of his own, the mercury\r\nstands at 102. Twice it has risen this Summer to the same height;\r\n_viz._ on the 28th of June, and the 11th of July. Several times it has\r\nbeen at 100, and for many days successively at 98; and did not in the\r\nnights sink below 89. I think it highly probable, that the inhabitants\r\nof this town breathe a hotter air than any other people on the face of\r\nthe earth. The greatest heat we had last year was but 92, and that but\r\nonce: from 84 to 90 were the usual variations; but this is reckoned\r\nan extraordinary hot summer. The weather-wise of this country say it\r\nforebodes a hurricane; for it has always been remarked, that these\r\ntempests have been preceded by continual and uncommon heats. I must\r\nacquaint you, however, that the heats we are subject to here are more\r\nintense than in any other parts of the province, the town of Savannah\r\nbeing situated upon a sandy eminence, and sheltered all round with high\r\nwoods. But it is very sufficient, that the people actually breathe so\r\nhot an air as I describe; and no less remarkable, that this very spot,\r\nfrom its height and dryness, is reckoned equally healthy with any other\r\nin the province.\r\n\r\nI have frequently walked an hundred yards under an umbrella, with a\r\nthermometer suspended from it by a thread to the height of my nostrils,\r\nwhen the mercury has rose to 105; which is prodigious. At the same\r\ntime I have confined this instrument close to the hottest part of my\r\nbody, and have been astonished to observe, that it has subsided several\r\ndegrees. Indeed, I never could raise the mercury above 97 with the heat\r\nof my body.\r\n\r\nYou know, dear Sir, that I have traversed a great part of this globe,\r\nnot without giving some attention to the peculiarities of each climate;\r\nand I can fairly pronounce, that I never felt such heats any-where as\r\nin Georgia. I know experiments on this subject are extremely liable to\r\nerror; but I presume I cannot now be mistaken, either in the goodness\r\nof the instrument, or in the fairness of the trials, which I have\r\nrepeatedly made with it. This same thermometer I have had thrice in the\r\nequatorial parts of Africa; as often at Jamaica, and the West India\r\nislands; and, upon examination of my journals, I do not find, that the\r\nquicksilver ever rose in those parts above the 87th degree, and to that\r\nbut seldom: its general station was between the 79th and 86th degree;\r\nand yet I think I have felt those degrees, with a moist air, more\r\ndisagreeable than what I now feel.\r\n\r\nIn my relation of the late expedition to the north-west, if I\r\nrecollect right, I have observed, that all the changes and variety of\r\nweather, that happen in the temperate zone throughout the year, may be\r\nexperienced at the Hudson’s Bay settlements in 24 hours. But I may now\r\nextend this observation; for in my cellar the thermometer stands at 81,\r\nin the next story at 102, and in the upper one at 105; and yet these\r\nheats, violent as they are, would be tolerable, but for the sudden\r\nchanges that succeed them. On the 10th of December last the mercury was\r\nat 86; on the 11th it was so low as 38 of the same instrument. What\r\nhavock must this make with an European constitution? Nevertheless, but\r\nfew people die here out of the ordinary course; tho’ indeed one can\r\nscarce call it living, merely to breathe, and trail about a vigorless\r\nbody; yet such is generally our condition from the middle of June to\r\nthe middle of September. Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n                      Yours most affectionately,\r\n                             Henry Ellis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIII. _The Invention of a General Method for determining the Sum of\r\nevery 2d, 3d, 4th, or 5th_, &c. _Term of a Series, taken in order; the\r\nSum of the whole Series being known. By_ Thomas Simpson, _F.R.S._\r\n\r\n[Read Nov. 16, 1758.]\r\n\r\nAS the doctrine of Series’ is of very great use in the higher branches\r\nof the mathematics, and their application to nature, every attempt\r\ntending to extend that doctrine may justly merit some degree of regard.\r\nThe subject of the paper, which I have now the honour to lay before the\r\nSociety, will be found an improvement of some consequence in that part\r\nof science. And how far the business of finding fluents may, in some\r\ncases, be facilitated thereby, will appear from the examples subjoined,\r\nin illustration of the general method here delivered.\r\n\r\nThe series propounded, whose sum (_S_) is supposed to be given (either\r\nin algebraic terms, or by the measures of angles and ratio’s, _&c._)\r\nI shall here represent by _a_ + _bx_ + _cx_² + _dx_³ + _ex_⁴, &c. and\r\nshall first give the solution of that case, where every third term is\r\nrequired to be taken, or where the series to be summed is _a_ + _dx_³ +\r\n_gx_⁶ + _kx_⁶, &c. By means whereof, the general method of proceeding,\r\nand the resolution of every other case, will appear evident.\r\n\r\nHere, then, every _third_ term being required to be taken, let the\r\nseries (_a_ + _dx_³ + _gx_⁶, &c.), whose value is sought, be conceived\r\nto be composed of _three_ others.\r\n\r\n    ⅓ × (_a_ + _b_ × (_px_) + _c_ × (_px_)² + _d_ × (_px_)³ + _e_ ×\r\n    (_px_)⁴, &c.)\r\n\r\n    ⅓ × (_a_ + _b_ × (_qx_) + _c_ × (_qx_)² + _d_ × (_qx_)³ + _e_ ×\r\n    (_qx_)⁴, &c.)\r\n\r\n    ⅓ × (_a_ + _b_ × (_rx_) + _c_ × (_rx_)² + _d_ × (_rx_)³ + _e_ ×\r\n    (_rx_)⁴, &c.)\r\n\r\nhaving all the _same form_, and the _same coefficients_ with the series\r\nfirst proposed, and wherein the converging quantities _px_, _qx_, _rx_,\r\nare also in a determinate (tho’ yet unknown) ratio to the original\r\nconverging quantity _x_. Now, in order to determine the quantities\r\nof these ratios, or the values of _p_, _q_, and _r_, let the terms\r\ncontaining the same powers of _x_, in the two equal values, be equated\r\nin the common way:\r\n\r\nSo shall,\r\n\r\n  ⅓ _b_ × _px_ + ⅓ _b_ × _qx_ + ⅓ _b_ × _rx_ = 0\r\n  ⅓ _c_ × _p_²_x_² + ⅓ _c_ × _q_²_x_² + ⅓ _c_ × _r_²_x_² = 0\r\n  ⅓ _d_ × _p_³_x_³ + ⅓ _d_ × _q_³_x_³ + ⅓ _d_ × _r_³_x_³ = _dx_³\r\n  ⅓ _e_ × _p_⁴_x_⁴ + ⅓ _e_ × _q_⁴_x_⁴ + ⅓ _e_ × _r_⁴_x_⁴ = 0\r\n  &c.\r\n\r\nAnd consequently,\r\n\r\n  _p_ + _q_ + _r_ = 0\r\n  _p_² + _q_² + _r_² = 0\r\n  _p_³ + _q_³ + _r_³ = 3\r\n  _p_⁴ + _q_⁴ + _r_⁴ = 0, &c.\r\n\r\nMake, now, _p_³ = 1, _q_³ = 1, and _r_³ = 1; that is, let _p_, _q_,\r\nand _r_, be the three roots of the cubic equation _z_³ = 1, or _z_³ -\r\n1 = 0: then, seeing both the second and third terms of this equation\r\nare wanting, not only the sum of all the roots (_p_ + _q_ + _r_) but\r\nthe sum of all their squares (_p_² + _q_² + _r_²) will vanish, or be\r\nequal to nothing (by common algebra), as they ought, to fulfil the\r\nconditions of the two first equations. Moreover, since _p_³ = 1, _q_³\r\n= 1, and _r_³ = 1, it is also evident, that _p_⁴ + _q_⁴ + _r_⁴ (= _p_\r\n+ _q_ + _r_) = 0, _p_⁵ + _q_⁵ + _r_⁵ (= _p_² +_q_² + _r_²) = 0, _p_⁶\r\n+ _q_⁶ + _r_⁶ (= _p_³ + _q_³ + _r_³) = 3. Which equations being, in\r\neffect, nothing more than the first three repeated, the values of\r\n_p_, _q_, _r_, above assigned, equally fulfil the conditions of these\r\nalso: so that the series arising from the addition of three assumed\r\nones will agree, in every term, with _that_ whose sum is required: but\r\nthose series’ (whereof the quantity in question is composed) having\r\nall of them the _same form_ and the _same coefficients_ with the\r\noriginal series _a_ + _bx_ + _cx_² + _dx_³, &c. (= _S_), their sums\r\nwill therefore be truly obtained, by substituting _px_, _qx_, and _rx_,\r\nsuccessively, for _x_, in the given value of _S_. And, by the very same\r\nreasoning, and the process above laid down, it is evident, that, if\r\nevery _nᵗʰ_ term (instead of every third term) of the given series be\r\ntaken, the values of _p_, _q_, _r_, _s_, &c. will then be the roots of\r\nthe equation _zⁿ_ - 1 = 0[155]; and that, the sum of all the terms so\r\ntaken, will be truly obtained by substituting _px_, _qx_, _rx_, _sx_,\r\n&c. successively for _x_, in the given value of _S_, and then dividing\r\nthe sum of all the quantities thence arising by the given number _n_.\r\n\r\nThe same method of solution holds equally, when, in taking every _n_ᵗʰ\r\nterm of the series, the operation begins at some term after the first.\r\nFor all the terms preceding _that_ may be transposed, and the whole\r\nequation divided by the power of _x_ in the first of the remaining\r\nterms; and then the sum of every _nᵗʰ_ term (beginning at the first)\r\nwill be found by the preceding directions; which sum, multiplied by\r\nthe power of _x_ that before divided, will evidently give the true\r\nvalue required to be determined. Thus, for example, let it be required\r\nto find the sum of every third term of the given series _a_ + _bx_ +\r\n_cx_² + _dx_³ + _ex_⁴, &c. (= _S_), beginning with _cx_². Then, by\r\ntransposing the two first terms, and dividing the whole by _x_², we\r\nshall have _c_ + _dx_ + _ex_² + _fx_³, &c. = (_S_ - _a_ - _bx_) ⁄\r\n(_xx_) (= _S´_). From whence having found the sum of every third term\r\nof the series _c_ + _dx_ + _ex_² + _fx_³, &c. beginning at the first\r\n(_c_), that sum, multiplied by _x_², will manifestly give the true\r\nvalue sought in the present case.\r\n\r\nAnd here it may be worth while to observe, that all the terms preceding\r\n_that_ at which the operation (in any case) begins, may (provided they\r\nexceed not in number the given interval _n_) be intirely disregarded,\r\nas having no effect at all in the result. For if in that part ((-_a_ -\r\n_bx_) ⁄ _xx_) of the value of _S´_, above exhibited, in which the first\r\nterms, _a_ and _bx_, enter, there be substituted _px_, _qx_, _rx_,\r\nsuccessively, for _x_ (according to the _prescript_) the sum of the\r\nquantities thence arising will be\r\n\r\n  - _a_ ⁄ (_p_²_x_²) - _a_ ⁄ (_q_²_x_²) - _a_ ⁄ (_r_²_x_²)\r\n  - _b_ ⁄ _px_ - _b_ ⁄ _qx_ - _b_ ⁄ _rx_\r\n\r\nwhich, because _p_³ = 1, _q_³ = 1, &c. (or _p_² = 1 ⁄ _p_, _q_² = 1 ⁄\r\n_q_, &c.) may be expressed thus;\r\n\r\n  - _a_ ⁄ _xx_ × (_p_ + _q_ + _r_)\r\n  - _b_ ⁄ _x_ × (_p_² + _q_² + _r_²)\r\n\r\nBut, that _p_ + _q_ + _r_ = 0, and _p_² + _q_² + _r_² = 0, hath been\r\nalready shewn; whence the truth of the general observation is manifest.\r\nHence it also appears, that the method of solution above delivered,\r\nis not only general, but includes this singular beauty and advantage,\r\nthat in all series’ whatever, whereof the terms are to be taken\r\naccording to the same assigned order, the quantities (_p_, _q_, _r_,\r\n&c.), whereby the resolution is performed, will remain invariably the\r\nsame. The greater part of these quantities are indeed _imaginary_ ones;\r\nand so likewise will the quantities be that result from them, when\r\nsubstitution is made in the given expression for the value of _S_. But\r\nby adding, as is usual in like cases, every two corresponding values,\r\nso resulting together, all marks of _impossibility_ will disappear.\r\n\r\nIf, in the series to be summed, the alternate terms (_viz._ the 2d,\r\n4th, 6th, _&c._) should be required to be taken under signs contrary to\r\nwhat they have in the original series given; the reasoning and result\r\nwill be no-ways different; only, instead of making _p_³ + _q_³ + _r_³\r\n(or _pⁿ_ + _qⁿ_ + _rⁿ_, &c.) = +3 (or +_n_), the same quantity must,\r\nhere, be made = -3 (or -_n_). From whence, _pⁿ_ being = -1, _qⁿ_ = -1,\r\n&c. the values of _p_, _q_, _r_, &c. will, in this case, be the roots\r\nof the equation _zⁿ_ + 1 = 0.\r\n\r\nIt may be proper, now, to put down an example, or two, of the use and\r\napplication of the general conclusions above derived. First, then,\r\nsupposing the series, whose sum is given, to be _x_ + _x²_ ⁄ 2 + _x³_\r\n⁄ 3 + _x⁴_ ⁄ 4 ... + _xᵐ_ ⁄ _m_ + _xᵐ ⁺ ¹_) ⁄ (_m_ + 1) + _xᵐ ⁺ ²_ ⁄\r\n(_m_ + 2) ... + _xᵐ ⁺ ⁿ_ ⁄ (_m_ + _n_) + _xᵐ ⁺ ⁿ ⁺ ¹_ ⁄ (_m_ + _n_ + 1)\r\n+, &c. = - H. Log.(1-_x_) (= _S_); let it be required, from hence, to\r\nfind the sum of the series (_xᵐ_ ⁄ _m_ + _xᵐ ⁺ ⁿ_ ⁄ (_m_ + _n_) + _xᵐ\r\n⁺ ²ⁿ_ ⁄ (_m_ + 2_n_) &c.) arising by taking every _nᵗʰ_ term thereof,\r\nbeginning with that whose exponent (_m_) is any integer less than _n_.\r\nHere, the terms preceding _xᵐ_ ⁄ _m_ being transposed, and the whole\r\nequation divided by _xᵐ_, we shall have 1 ⁄ _m_ + _x_ ⁄ (_m_ + 1) +\r\n_x_² ⁄ (_m_ + 2) + _x_³ ⁄ (_m_ + 3), &c. = -(1 ⁄ _xᵐ_) × H. Log.(1 -\r\n_x_) - (_x_ + ½_x_², &c.) ⁄ _xᵐ_. In which value, let _px_, _qx_, _rx_,\r\n&c. be, successively, substituted for _x_ (according to prescript)\r\nneglecting intirely the terms (_x_ + ½_x_²) ⁄ _xᵐ_, as having no effect\r\nat all in the result: from whence we get -1 ⁄ (_(px)ᵐ_) × Log.(1 -\r\n_px_) - (1 ⁄ _(qx)ᵐ_) × Log.(1 - _qx_) - (1 ⁄ _(rx)ᵐ_) × Log.(1 -\r\n_rx_), &c. Which multiplied by _xᵐ_ (the quantity that before divided)\r\ngives -1 ⁄ (_pᵐ_) × Log.(1 - _px_) - 1 ⁄ (_qᵐ_) × Log.(1 - _qx_) - 1 ⁄\r\n(_rᵐ_) × Log.(1 - _rx_), &c. = _n_ times the quantity required to be\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nBut now, to get rid of the imaginary quantities _q_, _r_, &c. by means\r\nof their known values α + √(αα - 1), α - √(αα - 1), &c. it will be\r\nnecessary to observe, that, as the product of any two corresponding\r\nones (α + √(αα - 1) × (α - √(αα - 1)) is equal to unity, we may\r\ntherefore write (α - √(αα - 1))_ᵐ_ (= _rᵐ_) instead of its equal 1\r\n⁄ (_qᵐ_), and (α + √(αα - 1))_ᵐ_ (= _qᵐ_) instead of its equal 1 ⁄\r\n(_rᵐ_): by which means the two terms, wherein these two quantities\r\nenter, will stand thus; -(α - √(αα - 1))_ⁿ_ × Log. (1 - _qx_) - (α +\r\n√(αα - 1))_ᵐ_ × Log. (1 - _rx_).\r\n\r\nBut, if _A_ be assumed to express the co-sine of an arch (_Q_), _m_\r\ntimes as great as that (360° ⁄ _n_) whose co-sine is here denoted by α;\r\nthen will _A_ - √(_AA_ - 1) = [156](α - √(αα - 1))_ᵐ_, and _A_ + √(_AA_\r\n- 1) = (α + √(αα - 1))_ᵐ_: which values being substituted above, we\r\nthence get\r\n\r\n  -_A_ × (log. (1 - _qx_) + log. (1 - _rx_)) + √(_AA_\r\n  - 1) × (log. (1 - _qx_) - log. (1 - _rx_));\r\n\r\n\r\nwhereof the former part (which, exclusive of the factor _A_, I shall\r\nhereafter denote by _M_) is manifestly equal to -_A_ × log. ((1 - _qx_)\r\n× (1 - _rx_)) (by the nature of logarithms) = -_A_ × log. 1 - (_q_ +\r\n_r_)._x_ + _qrx_² = -_A_ × log. (1 - 2α_x_ + _xx_) (by substituting\r\nthe values of _q_ and _r_): which is now intirely free from imaginary\r\nquantities. But, in order to exterminate them out of the latter part\r\nalso, put _y_ = log. (1 - _qx_) - log.

From whence the sum of any other two corresponding terms will\r\nbe had, by barely substituting one letter, or value, for another: So\r\nthat,\r\n\r\n             { -log.

And here it\r\nmay not be amiss to take notice, that the series _xᵐ_ ⁄ _m_ + _xᵐ ⁺ ⁿ_\r\n⁄ (_m_ + _n_) + _xᵐ ⁺ ²ⁿ_ ⁄ (_m_ + 2_n_) + &c. thus determined, is that\r\nexpressing the fluent of (_xᵐ ⁻ ¹ẋ_) ⁄ (1 - _xⁿ_); corresponding to one\r\nof the two famous _Cotesian forms_. From whence, and the reasoning\r\nabove laid down, the fluent of the other _form_, _xᵐ ⁻ ¹ẋ_ ⁄ (1 +\r\n_xⁿ_), may be very readily deduced. For, since the series (_xᵐ_ ⁄ _m_ -\r\n_xᵐ ⁺ ⁿ_ ⁄ (_m_ + _n_) + _xᵐ ⁺ ²ⁿ_ ⁄ (_m_ + 2_n_) - _xᵐ ⁺ ³ⁿ_ ⁄ (_m_ +\r\n3_n_) &c.) for this last fluent, is that which arises by changing the\r\nsigns of the alternate terms of the former; the quantities _p_, _q_,\r\n_r_, &c. will here (agreeably to a preceding observation) be the roots\r\nof the equation _zⁿ_ + 1 = 0; and, consequently, α, β, γ, δ, &c. the\r\nco-sines of the arcs 180° ⁄ _n_, 3 × 180° ⁄ _n_, 5 × 180° ⁄ _n_, &c.\r\n(as appears by the foregoing note). So that, making _Q_, _Q´_, _Q´´_,\r\n&c. equal, here, to the measures of the angles (180° ⁄ _n_) × _m_, 3 ×\r\n(180° ⁄ _n_) × _m_, 5 × (180° ⁄ _n_) × _m_, &c. the fluent sought will\r\nbe expressed in the very same manner as in the preceding case; except\r\nthat the first term, -log. (1 - _x_) (arising from the _rational_ root\r\n_p_ = 1) will here have no place.\r\n\r\nAfter the same manner, with a small increase of trouble, the fluent of\r\n_xᵐ ⁻ ¹ẋ_ ⁄ (1 ± 2_lxⁿ_ + _x_²_ⁿ_) may be derived, _m_ and _n_ being\r\nany integers whatever. But I shall now put down one example, wherein\r\nthe impossible quantities become exponents of the powers, in the terms\r\nwhere they are concerned.\r\n\r\nThe series here given is 1 - _x_ + _x_² ⁄ 2 + _x_³ ⁄ (2.3) + _x_⁴\r\n⁄ (2.3.4) - _x_⁵ ⁄ (2.3.4.5), &c. = the number whose hyp. log. is\r\n-_x_, and it is required to find the sum of every _nᵗʰ_ term thereof,\r\nbeginning at the first. Here the quantity sought will (according to the\r\ngeneral rule) be truly defined by the _nᵗʰ_ part of the sum of all the\r\nnumbers whose respective logarithms are -_px_, -_qx_, -_rx_, &c.; which\r\nnumbers, if _N_ be taken to denote the number whose hyp. log. = 1,\r\nwill be truly expressed by _N⁻ᵖˣ_, _N⁻⒬ˣ_, _N⁻ʳˣ_, &c. From whence, by\r\nwriting for _p_, _q_, _r_, &c. their equals 1, α + √(αα - 1), α - √(αα\r\n- 1), β + √(ββ - 1), β - √(ββ - 1), &c. and putting α´ = √(1 - αα), β´\r\n= √(1 - ββ), &c. we shall have 1 ⁄ _n_ × (_N⁻ᵖˣ_ + _N⁻⒬ˣ_ + _N⁻ʳˣ_),\r\n&c. = 1 ⁄ _n_ into _N⁻ˣ_ + _N⁻ᵃˣ_ × (_N⁻ᵃ‘ˣ_√⁻¹) + (_Nᵃ‘ˣ_√⁻¹) + _N⁻ᵝˣ_\r\n× (_N⁻ᵝ‘ˣ√⁻¹_) + _Nᵝ‘ˣ√⁻¹_) + &c. But _N⁻ᵃ‘ˣ√⁻¹_ + _Nᵃ‘ˣ√⁻¹_ is known\r\nto express the double of the co-sine of the arch whose measure (to the\r\nradius 1) is α´_x_. Therefore we have 1 ⁄ _n_ into _N⁻ˣ_ + _N⁻ᵃˣ_ × 2\r\nco-s. α´_x_ + _N⁻ᵝˣ_ × 2 co-s. β´_x_, &c. for the true sum, or value\r\nproposed to be determined.\r\n\r\nThe solution of this case, in a manner a little different, I have\r\ngiven some time since, in another place; where the principles of the\r\ngeneral method, here extended and illustrated, are pointed out. I shall\r\nput an end to this paper with observing, that if, in the series given,\r\nthe even powers of _x_, or any other terms whatever, be wanting, their\r\nplaces must be supplied with cyphers; which, in the order of numbering\r\noff, must be reckoned as real terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIV. _Observatio Eclipsis Lunæ Die_ 30 Julii 1757. _habita Olissipone\r\nà_ Joanne Chevalier, _Congregationis Oratorii Presbytero, é Regia_\r\nLondinensi _Societate.

D. F.R.S. Translated from the_ French.\r\n\r\n[Read Nov. 16, 1758.]\r\n\r\nTHe cruel effects of the tree called Manchenille are known to all the\r\nworld: its milk, which the savages make use of to poison their arrows,\r\nmakes the wounds inflicted with them mortal. The rain, which washes\r\nthe leaves and branches, causes blisters to rise like boiling oil;\r\neven the shade of the tree makes those who repose under it to swell;\r\nand its fruit is esteemed a deadly poison. I was informed, as a very\r\nextraordinary thing, that a breeding woman was so mad as to eat three\r\nof them, which did her very little harm; and this was looked upon as a\r\nmiracle, and a proof of the surprising effects of the imagination and\r\nlongings of women with child.\r\n\r\nBut here is a fact, which will scarce be credited by many persons, who\r\nhave frequented these Islands: which I declare to be true.\r\n\r\nOne Vincent Banchi, of Turin in Piedmont, a strong robust man, and an\r\nold soldier, of about forty-five years of age, belonging to the horse,\r\nwas a slave with the Turks eleven years, having been taken prisoner at\r\nthe siege of Belgrade. He was overseer of my habitation towards the\r\nmonth of July of the year 1756. He was one day walking upon the sea\r\nside, and seeing a great number of apples upon the ground, was charmed\r\nwith their beautiful colours, and sweet smell, resembling that of the\r\napple called d’apis: he took and eat of them, without knowing what they\r\nwere; he found they had a subacid taste; and having eaten a couple of\r\ndozen of them, he fill’d his pockets, and came home, eating the rest as\r\nhe came. The Negroes, that saw him eat this cruel fruit, told him it\r\nwas mortal; upon which he ceased to eat them, and threw away the rest.\r\n\r\nAbout four in the afternoon, _viz._ an hour after this repast, his\r\nbelly swelled considerably, and he felt as it were a consuming fire\r\nin his bowels. He could not keep himself upright; and at night the\r\nswelling of his belly increased, with the burning sensation of his\r\nbowels. His lips were ulcerated with the milk of the fruit, and he was\r\nseized with cold sweats; but my principal Negro made him a decoction of\r\nthe leaves of a _Ricinus_[157] in water, and made him drink plentifully\r\nof it, which brought on a vomiting, followed by a violent purging;\r\nboth which continued for four hours, during which it was thought he\r\nwould die. At length these symptoms grew less; and my Negroes made him\r\nwalk, and stir about by degrees; and soon after they were stopped.\r\nRice-gruel, which they gave him, put an end to all these disorders; and\r\nin four-and-twenty hours he had no more ailments nor pain; the swelling\r\nof his belly diminished in proportion to his evacuations upwards and\r\ndownwards, and he has continued his functions without being any more\r\nsensible of the poison. We see by this, that the effects of the poison\r\nof the Manchenille are different from those of the fish at Guadaloupe,\r\nwhich I mentioned.\r\n\r\nDec. 2. 1756.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCVI. _Abstract of a Letter from Mr._ William Arderon, _F.R.S. to Mr._\r\nHenry Baker, _F.R.S. on the giving Magnetism and Polarity to Brass.\r\nCommunicated by Mr._ Baker.\r\n\r\n[Read Nov. 16, 1758.]\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nFOR some time past I have been making experiments on the magnetism of\r\nbrass, and amongst many pieces that I have tried, find several that\r\nreadily attract the needle; but whether they have had this property\r\noriginally, or have received it by hammering, filing, clipping, or any\r\nother such-like cause, I cannot yet determine.\r\n\r\nI have a very handsome compass-box made of pure brass, as far as I can\r\njudge: the needle being taken out, and placed upon a pin fixed properly\r\nin a board, and clear of all other magnetics, the box will attract this\r\nneedle at half an inch distance; and, if suffered to touch, will draw\r\nit full 90 degrees from the north or south points; and I think those\r\nparts of the box marked north and south attract the strongest. The\r\ncover of the box also attracts the needle nearly as much as the box\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nAs to your supposition, that iron may be mixed with the brass, I do not\r\nknow; but I have been informed it cannot be, as brass fluxes with a\r\nmuch less degree of heat than iron, and iron naturally swims on fluid\r\nbrass. Besides, many of the specimens of brass I have tried were new\r\nas they came from the mill, where they were wrought into plates, and\r\nI presume were not mixed[158]; yet these I have given the magnetic\r\nvirtue to, when they had it not; and some pieces of brass, which\r\nnaturally attract the needle, seem to the eye as fine a bright yellow\r\nas any other, and are as malleable as any I ever met with.\r\n\r\nPieces of brass without any magnetic power, by properly hammering and\r\ngiving them the double touch, after Mr. Mitchel’s method, I have made\r\nattract and repel the needle, as a magnet does, having two regular\r\npoles: and I now send you one such piece of brass, which I have thus\r\nmade magnetical. You will also receive a couple of needles, which I\r\nmade myself after the late Zachary Williams’s method, and a little\r\nstand whereon to place them, the better to shew how this magnetic bar\r\nattracts and repels the needle when properly applied; for it must be\r\nnoted, that in making these experiments it is necessary to employ a\r\nvery good needle, about 3-½ inches long, well and tenderly set, and not\r\ncovered with glass.\r\n\r\nYou will observe, when you try this bar, that the same poles repel each\r\nother, and the contrary poles attract; which proves this piece of brass\r\nto be indued with true magnetic virtue and polarity. However it must be\r\nnoted, that though the same poles repel each other, yet, like natural\r\nmagnets, in contact, or nearly so, they attract each other; therefore\r\nwhen you would shew the repelling power of this brass bar, you must not\r\nbring it nearer the needle than ²⁄₁₀ of an inch.\r\n\r\nMagnetic brass does not attract iron, not even the least particle, so\r\nfar as I can find: whether this is owing to the weakness of magnetism\r\nin the brass, or to some other cause, I don’t pretend to know.\r\n\r\nI have tried to infuse magnetic virtue into several pieces of copper,\r\nlead and pewter; but all my endeavours have not been able to make them\r\nattract the needle at all. Indeed, when I have held a piece of pewter,\r\nthat I have tryed to make magnetical, to the needle, the needle would\r\ntremble, but not approach the pewter.\r\n\r\nI send you another piece of brass, whose either end attracts either of\r\nthe poles; this I have infused the magnetic virtue into, and can at any\r\ntime, so as to attract and repel the needle; but, like steel that is\r\nset a low blue, it loseth that polarity in a few hours; which may arise\r\nfor its being too short for its weight, or from its different temper of\r\nhardness or softness.\r\n\r\nA third piece I also send you, which with all my endeavours I cannot\r\nmake attract the needle in the least; and yet I can perceive no\r\ndifference between the appearance of this piece and that of those which\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nWould some ingenious man pursue these experiments, perhaps we might\r\nhave needles made of brass to act as strongly as steel ones do, which\r\nwould have the advantage of being less liable to rust at sea than steel\r\nones are.\r\n\r\nBut my whole design was to shew, that brass is by no means a proper\r\nmetal to make compass-boxes of, or to be employed in any instrument\r\nwhere magnetism is concerned. For as it is demonstrable, beyond\r\nall contradiction, that some brass is found endued with a power of\r\nattracting the magnetic needle; that other pieces are capable of\r\nreceiving it either by accident or design, (let it be from its being\r\nmixed with iron, or any other cause whatever) brass must be a very\r\nimproper metal for compass-boxes, as it may occasion many sad and fatal\r\naccidents.\r\n\r\nNorwich, Octob. 20th, 1758.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well known, that brass has been sometimes found to affect and\r\ndisturb the magnetic needle; but, to give magnetism and polarity\r\nto brass, has not, that I have yet heard, been before attempted. I\r\ntherefore have taken the liberty to lay the above account before this\r\nRoyal Society, and have also brought the pieces of brass mentioned\r\ntherein, which have been thus made magnetical.\r\n\r\n                                                              H. Baker.\r\n\r\nLondon, Nov. 15. 1759.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCVII. _An Account of the_ Sea Polypus, _by Mr._ Henry Baker, _F.R.S._\r\n\r\n_To the Right Honourable the_ EARL _of_ MACCLESFIELD, President _of\r\nthe_ Royal Society.\r\n\r\n[Read Nov. 23, 1758.]\r\n\r\nMy Lord,\r\n\r\nI now return the marine animal your Lordship did me the honour to\r\nrecommend to my examination; which I find to be a species of one kind\r\nof the Sea Polypi, mentioned by naturalists; but I think not very\r\naccurately described.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe kinds of Sea Polypi are understood to be,\r\n\r\n_First_, The Polypus, particularly so called, the Octopus, Preke, or\r\nPour-contrel: to which kind our subject belongs.\r\n\r\n_Secondly_, The Sepia, or Cuttle-fish.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly_, The Loligo, or Calamary. And each of these has its different\r\nspecies and varieties[159]. The ancients add the Nautilus; and some\r\nsorts of Star-fish might perhaps be not improperly ranged among them.\r\n\r\nAll of the first kind have eight arms, placed at equal distances round\r\nthe head; below the arms are two eyes, and the body is short and thick.\r\n\r\nThe Cuttle-fish, and the Calamary, have each of them ten arms; of which\r\neight are shorter ones, tapering gradually to a point from the head,\r\nwhere they all rise, to their extremities: the other two (frequently\r\ncalled Tentacula) are three or four times as long, perfectly round,\r\nslender, and of an equal thickness for above two thirds of their whole\r\nlength; then spreading into a form nearly like that of the shorter\r\narms. Great numbers of _acetabula_, or suckers, are placed somewhat\r\nirregularly on each of the shorter arms, and on the spreading parts of\r\nthe Tentacula, where some of the suckers are a great deal larger than\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\nThe body of the Cuttle-fish is broad and flat, having within it a broad\r\nfriable white bone; that of the Calamary is a sort of cartilaginous\r\ncase holding the intestines, of a roundish oblong shape, furnished with\r\ntwo fins, and having within it a thin transparent elastic substance\r\nlike Isinglass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Philos. Trans. Vol. L._ TAB. XXIX. _p. 779_\r\n\r\n  _G. Edwards delin AD. 1758_        _J. Mynde sc._]\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the Pour-contrel, Cuttle-fish, and Calamary, is placed in\r\nthe fore-part of the head, between the arms, having an horny beak, hard\r\nand hooked like a parrot’s, which some writers call the teeth. The eyes\r\nof them all are nearly in the same position.\r\n\r\nAs the subject under examination resembles in some particulars all the\r\nabove kinds of Polypi, this short account of them may, it is hoped,\r\nrender the following description of it the more intelligible: and\r\nwith the same view, Mr. George Edwards, Fellow of the Royal Society,\r\nhas been so obliging as to make drawings of the animal itself, in\r\nfour different positions, and of the natural size; which drawings are\r\nherewith presented to your Lordship.\r\n\r\nOur Polypus is of the Pour-contrel kind, and I believe of that species\r\ncalled Bolytæna; which is said to have a musky smell; but if ours had\r\nsuch a smell, the spirits wherein it lies have taken it quite away.\r\n\r\nIn the drawing [_See_ TAB. XXIX. _Fig._ 1.] is shewn the anterior part\r\nof this animal, which has much the appearance of a Star-fish. Here\r\nare eight arms about three inches in length, united at their roots,\r\nand placed circularly at equal distances in the same plane, which has\r\na considerable sinking towards the center. These arms diminish from\r\ntheir rise to their extremities, and end exceedingly small. Near the\r\nhead they are quadrilateral, but the under-side contracting gradually\r\nto an edge, they become towards the ends trilateral. On the upper side\r\nof each arm are two rows of _acetabula_, or suckers, standing in a\r\nbeautiful order, as close as they can well be placed, and beginning\r\nfrom the center of all the arms. These suckers are perfectly circular,\r\nwith edges flat on the top, and a round cavity in the middle of each.\r\nThey are largest in the widest part of the arm, and lessen as the arm\r\ndiminishes, till they become so small as hardly to be discernable. It\r\nis very difficult to tell their number: I counted as far as fifty in a\r\nrow, but am certain there are many more; and I don’t imagine the eight\r\narms have so few as a thousand on them. They rise some height above the\r\nsurface of the skin; and wherever they are not, the skin of the arms\r\n(unless on the under-side) is granulated like shagreen[160].\r\n\r\nAs in the other kinds of Polypi the mouth is placed between the arms\r\nconspicuously enough, I expected to find it so in this; but the spirits\r\nhad contracted it so much, that I could discern no opening at all\r\nwhere I thought the mouth must be; and therefore could not say, with\r\nassurance, that the mouth was placed there. Under this difficulty\r\nI applied to Sir Hans Sloane’s most valuable collection of natural\r\nhistory in the British Musæum, where I found several species of this\r\nkind of Polypi, and amongst the rest a small dried specimen of the same\r\nspecies as ours, and a much larger one in spirits, of a species that\r\ncomes very near it.\r\n\r\nThis large specimen afforded the information I stood in need of: for\r\nthough here also the mouth was closed, and the beak drawn down into\r\nthe center between the arms, so as not to be seen at all; yet, by the\r\nhelp of Dr. Morton and Mr. Empson, I had the satisfaction to see the\r\nmouth opened, and the beak in the same situation, and of the same form\r\nand substance, as in the other kinds of Polypi. Having gained this\r\nknowledge, by applying the point of a bodkin, I easily felt the beak\r\nin our Polypus; but in so small a subject it cannot be brought to view\r\nwithout dissection, which is the reason it does not appear in these\r\ndrawings.\r\n\r\n_Fig. 2._ represents the Polypus so placed as to shew the situation of\r\nthe eyes and the form of its body, and also in what manner the arms\r\nare turned back in the specimen before us; but we may suppose them\r\nthus disposed merely in the act of dying, and that when alive they are\r\nmoveable in all directions.\r\n\r\nOn that side of the body opposite to the eyes, and which therefore may\r\nbe termed the belly-part, there appears a transverse slit or opening\r\nin the skin, not in a strait line, but a little semicircular; from the\r\nanterior part whereof a tube or pipe proceeds, about one third of an\r\ninch in length, smaller at the extremity, where it opens with a round\r\norifice, than at the base, and reaching to within a small distance of\r\nthe arms. As both the Cuttle-fish and Calamary have a pipe nearly in\r\nthe same situation, though somewhat different in figure, through which\r\nthey occasionally discharge an inky liquor, and some writers say the\r\nfæces also, it is probable the pipe in this animal may serve to a like\r\npurpose; and as the body of the Calamary is included in a case, the\r\nslit across the body of this animal shews its belly part to have also\r\na sort of case, though on its back there is no separation as in the\r\nCalamary.\r\n\r\nOut of the aforesaid slit or opening a bag issues with a very slender\r\nneck, extending towards the tail, and enlarging gradually to its end.\r\nThis bag is above half the length of the body, and appears like another\r\nbody appendant thereto. I should be intirely at a loss concerning\r\nthis bag, did not some passages in Mr. Turberville Needham’s curious\r\nobservations on the milt vessels of the Calamary enable me to form some\r\nconjectures about its use.\r\n\r\nHaving dissected several Calamaries on the coast of Portugal, without\r\nthe least indication of milt or roe, and consequently without knowing\r\nwhich were male or female, he was much surprised (about the middle\r\nof the month of December) to find a new vessel forming itself in an\r\nobvious part, and replete with a milky juice. This was an oval bag, in\r\nwhich the milt vessels formed themselves gradually, the bag unfolding\r\nas these framed and disposed themselves in bundles. Before that time\r\nhe had observed two collateral tubes, which are alike in both sexes;\r\nbut a regular progress in the expansion of the milt-bag and formation\r\nof the milt-vessels had not presented itself before. Those tubes till\r\nthen appeared open at one extremity, much resembling the female parts\r\nof generation in a snail, but did not terminate in a long oval bag\r\nextending in a parallel with the stomach more than half the length of\r\nthe fish, as he found them afterwards when the milt vessels that filled\r\nthe whole cavity were ripe for ejection. The same ducts without the bag\r\nare found in the female also, perhaps for the deposition of the spawn.\r\nVid. _Needham’s Microscopical Discoveries, cap._ v.\r\n\r\nIt appears from this account that the male Calamary (at a certain time\r\nof the year only) has a bag wherein the milt-vessels are contained,\r\nand that the female has no such bag. Since therefore the bag of our\r\nPolypus is found in the same situation as that of the Calamary, (which\r\nis also a kind of Polypus) we may suppose it to be the milt bag, and\r\nthat our Polypus is a male, taken at a time when the milt was ready for\r\nejection. In the dried specimen at the British Museum, and also in the\r\nother specimens, there is the same opening, with the pipe that rises\r\nabove it towards the arms, but not the least appearance of the bag in\r\nquestion: they are therefore probably females, or if males, were caught\r\nbefore such bag was formed.\r\n\r\n_Fig. 3._ presents another view of this Polypus, its arms extended\r\ncircularly with their under-sides next the eye, and the body so\r\ndisposed as to shew the transverse opening _a_, the oval bag issuing\r\ntherefrom _b_, and the pipe rising upwards towards the arms _c_.\r\n\r\n_Fig. 4._ shews the Polypus with its transverse opening and the pipe\r\nrising therefrom, but without the oval bag; it is figured thus by\r\nRondeletius and Gesner, and the specimen at the British Museum has also\r\nthis appearance. It is here shewn with the arms extended forwards. K\r\nis a magnified figure of one of the _acetabula_, or suckers; of which\r\nthere are two rows on each arm of this Polypus, as before described.\r\n\r\nMr. Needham, in his description of the suckers of the Calamary,\r\n(which he had many opportunities of examining whilst alive, and whose\r\nmechanism is probably the same as in those of our Polypus) informs\r\nus, “that the action of the suckers depends partly on their shape,\r\nwhich, when they are extended resembles nearly that of an acorn-cup,\r\nand partly upon a deep circular cartilaginous ring, armed with small\r\nhooks, which is secured in a thin membrane something transparent,\r\nby the projection of a ledge investing the whole circumference about\r\nthe middle of its depth, and not to be extracted without some force.\r\nThat each sucker is fastened by a tendinous stem to the arm of the\r\nanimal: which stem, together with part of the membrane that is below\r\nthe circumference of the cartilaginous ring, rises into and fills\r\nthe whole cavity when the animal contracts the sucker for action. In\r\nthis state whatever touches it is first held by the minute hooks, and\r\nthen drawn up to a closer adhesion by the retraction of the stem and\r\ninferior part of the membrane, much in the same manner as a sucker of\r\nwet leather sustains the weight of a small stone.” Vid. _Microscopical\r\nDiscoveries_, p. 22.\r\n\r\nM shews one of the cartilaginous rings armed with small hooks, of its\r\nreal size. The ring this is drawn from was taken out of a large sucker\r\nof a larger Polypus, and is presented herewith.\r\n\r\nBy these suckers the Polypus can fix itself to rocks, and prevent its\r\nbeing tossed about in storms and tempests; but their principal use\r\nmust undoubtedly be to seize and hold its prey: and to this purpose\r\nthey are most admirably adapted; for when they are all applied and act\r\ntogether, unless the Polypus pleases to withdraw them, nothing can get\r\nfrom it whose strength is insufficient to tear off its arms. Something\r\nlike these suckers is found by the microscope in the minute fresh water\r\nPolype, whereby it is able to bind down and manage a worm much larger\r\nand seemingly stronger than itself[161]. In like manner the _stella\r\narborescens_ (which may also be called a Polypus), though it has not\r\nsuckers, yet by the hooks along its arms, and the multiplicity of\r\ntheir branchings, which have been counted as far as 80,000, it can, by\r\nspreading its arms abroad like a net, so fetter and entangle the prey\r\nthey inclose when they are drawn together, as to render it incapable of\r\nexerting its strength: for however feeble these branches or arms may\r\nsingly be, their power united becomes surprising. And we are assured\r\nnature is so kind to all these animals, that if in their struggles any\r\nof their arms are broken off, after some time they will grow again; of\r\nwhich a specimen at the British Museum is an undoubted proof; for a\r\nlittle new arm is there seen sprouting forth in the room of a large one\r\nthat had been lost.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from what has been said, that the Sea Polypus must be\r\nterrible to the inhabitants of the waters, in proportion to its size\r\n(and Pliny mentions one whose arms were thirty feet in length); for the\r\nclose embraces of its arms and the adhesion of its suckers must render\r\nthe efforts of its prey ineffectual either for resistance or escape,\r\nunless it be endued with an extraordinary degree of strength.\r\n\r\nSea Polypi are frequent in the Mediterranean: but Mr. Haviland of Bath,\r\nto whom we are obliged for this, which is of a different species,\r\nthinks it came from the West Indies, where it is called a Cat-fish.\r\nThat like it in the British Museum also came from thence.\r\n\r\nAs the Polypus I have endeavoured to describe is much contracted by\r\nlying long in spirits, and dissection would destroy a specimen well\r\nworth preserving, I hope to be excused if this account should be found\r\ndeficient in several particulars, or chargeable with some mistakes.\r\n\r\nPermit me the honour to be,\r\n\r\n                               My LORD,\r\n                            Your Lordship’s\r\n                   Most humble and obedient Servant,\r\n                               H. Baker.\r\n\r\nStrand, Nov. 23d, 1758.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCVIII. _A Description of the fossil Skeleton of an Animal found in the\r\nAlum Rock near_ Whitby. _By Mr._ Wooller. _Communicated by_ Charles\r\nMorton, _M. D. F.R.S._\r\n\r\n[Read Nov. 23, 1758.]\r\n\r\nIT is in this rock, that the Ammonitæ, or Snake-stones, as they are\r\ncommonly called, are found, which have undoubtedly been formed in the\r\n_exuviæ_ of fishes of that shape; and though none of that species\r\nare now to be met with in the seas thereabouts, yet they in many\r\nparticulars resemble the Nautilus, which is well known. The internal\r\nsubstance of those stones, upon a section thereof, appears to be\r\na stony concretion, or muddy sparr. Stones of the same matter or\r\nsubstance, in the shape of muscles, cockles, &c. of various sizes,\r\nare also found therein, and now and then pieces of wood hardened and\r\ncrusted over with a stony substance are likewise found in it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Philos. Trans. Vol. L._ TAB. XXX. _p. 787_.\r\n\r\n_Part of the Fossil Skeleton of an Animal as it appeared on and united\r\nto the Allom Rock near_ Whitby, _Jan. 3. 1758_.\r\n\r\na. a. _&c. The Ammonitæ or Snake Stones_.\r\n\r\n_J. Mynde sc._]\r\n\r\nMany naturalists have already observed, that among the vast variety\r\nof extraneous substances found at several depths in the earth, where\r\nit is impossible they should have been bred, there are not so many\r\nproductions of the earth as of the sea; and it appears by the accounts\r\nof authors both ancient and modern, that bones, teeth, and sometimes\r\nentire skeletons of men and animals, have been dug up or discovered\r\nin all ages, and the most remarkable for size commonly the most taken\r\nnotice of. In the first particular this skeleton will most probably\r\nappear to have belonged to an animal of the lizard kind, quadruped and\r\namphibious; and as to its size, much larger than any thing of that kind\r\never met with or found in this part of the world; though, from the\r\naccounts of travellers, something similar is still to be met with in\r\nmany of the rivers, lakes, &c. of the other three.\r\n\r\nWhen the annexed drawing thereof was taken January 5, 1758. [_See_\r\nTAB. XXX.] there remained no more of the _vertebræ_ than is therein\r\nexpressed; that is, 10 between D and F, and 12 between G and H: but\r\nwhen it was first discovered, about 10 years ago, they were compleat;\r\nand there was besides the appearance of what was then thought to have\r\nbeen fins, near the back part of the head at A, the same as appeared\r\nfurther backward at E, when this design was made. The _vertebræ_, &c.\r\nnow wanting having been either dug up by curious persons, or washed\r\naway by the violence of the waves at high water, and the accidental\r\nbeating about of stones, sand, &c. during that time; the water covering\r\nthis skeleton several feet at high water in spring tides; the cavities\r\nin the rock still remaining as in the design.\r\n\r\nThe substance of the bones, with their _periostium_, on the covered\r\nor under side, in most parts remains intire, and their native colour\r\nin some places in a good measure preserved, and the teeth with their\r\nsmooth polish plainly to be discovered. Part of the mandible near the\r\nextremity was covered with a shelf of the rock about three inches\r\nthick; which being cut away and removed, both the mandibles appeared\r\nunder it compleat, with the teeth of the upper and under one, plainly\r\nlocking or passing by each other. These appeared to be of the _dentes\r\nexerti_ or fang kind, as well as all the others in the narrow part of\r\nthe mandible, and further backwards they were not observed. From this\r\nledge or shelf the mandible towards B is single, and appears to be the\r\nupper one of the living animal; and from the head not being exactly\r\nin the line of the body, that part has been inverted, or quite turned\r\nover, and the body itself, as appears from the transverse processes of\r\nthe _vertebræ_, lies on the right side. There appears one row of teeth\r\nonly on each side of the mandible, and they are about ¾ of an inch\r\nasunder.\r\n\r\nThe mandible B A, the _cranium g h_, and the _vertebræ_ from D to F,\r\nwere attempted to be taken up whole; but the bones being rendered\r\nextremely brittle, and the rock in which they were fixed being a\r\nbrittle blackish slate, with joints or fissures running in every\r\ndirection, would not hold together: the whole therefore fell in many\r\npieces, the _vertebræ_ in the joints only, which makes them easy to\r\njoin together again, and besides shows very plainly the transverse and\r\nspinal processes thereof, with the foramen in the latter for the spinal\r\nmarrow. It was now that a piece of the _os femoris_, about four inches\r\nlong, shewed itself in the sparry concreted substance at E, together\r\nwith a piece of the _os innominatum_, to which it had been articulated\r\nor joined. This, with what has been before remarked, will sufficiently\r\nprove this to have been an animal of the quadruped, and probably, from\r\nthe shape of the cranium peculiar to fishes, of the amphibious kind. At\r\nthe same time many pieces of the _costæ_ or ribs, as broke and crushed\r\nup against the _vertebræ_, were plainly visible. The cavities of all\r\nthe bones were filled with a substance, which appeared the same as the\r\nrock itself; and the substance on each side the _vertebræ_, as they\r\nlaid, was a mixture of sparry concreted matter with that of the rock\r\nitself, which is a blackish slate. The animal, when living, must have\r\nbeen at least 12 or 14 feet long. And the dimensions of the whole,\r\nor particular parts of the skeleton, may be measured from the scale\r\nannexed thereto.\r\n\r\nThis skeleton lay about six yards from the foot of the cliff, which is\r\nabout sixty yards in perpendicular height, and must have been covered\r\nby it probably not much more than a century ago. The cliff there\r\nis composed of various _strata_, beginning from the top, of earth,\r\nclay, marle, stones both hard and soft, of various thicknesses, and\r\nintermixed with each other, till it comes down to the black slate or\r\nalum rock, and about 10 or 12 feet deep in this rock, this skeleton\r\nlaid horizontally, and exactly as designed. The probability, that this\r\ncliff has formerly covered this animal, and extended much more into\r\nthe sea, is not in the least doubted of by those that know it. The\r\nvarious _strata_, of which it is composed, are daily mouldering and\r\nfalling down; and the bottom, being the slaty alum rock, is also daily\r\nbeat, washed, and wore away, and the upper parts undermined, whence\r\nmany thousand tuns often tumble down together. Many antient persons now\r\nliving, whose testimony can be no way doubted of, remember this very\r\ncliff extending in some places twenty yards further out than it does at\r\npresent. In short there is sufficient evidence, that at the beginning\r\nit must have extended near a mile further down to the sea than it does\r\nat present; and so much the sea has there gained of the land.\r\n\r\nThese are the principal facts and circumstances attending the situation\r\nand discovery of this skeleton; which from the condition it is in, and\r\nfrom the particular disposition of the _strata_ above the place where\r\nit is found, seem clearly to establish the opinion, and almost to a\r\ndemonstration, that the animal itself must have been antediluvian,\r\nand that it could not have been buried or brought there any otherwise\r\nthan by the force of the waters of the universal deluge. The different\r\n_strata_ above this skeleton never could have been broken through at\r\nany time, in order to bury it, to so great a depth as upwards of 180\r\nfeet; and consequently it must have been lodged there, if not before,\r\nat least at the time when those _strata_ were formed, which will not\r\nadmit of a later date than that above-mentioned.\r\n\r\n  _P. S._ In the xlixth vol. page 639, of the _Philosophical\r\n  Transactions_, an animal is described by Mr. Edwards, which was\r\n  brought from the Ganges, and resembles this in every respect. He\r\n  calls it _Lacerta (crocodilus) ventre marsupio donato, faucibus\r\n  Merganseris rostrum æmulantibus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Philos. Trans. Vol. L._ TAB.

S. from the Rev._ John Swinton, _M. A. of_ Christ-Church, Oxon.\r\n_F.R.S._\r\n\r\n[Read Dec. 7, 1758.]\r\n\r\nReverend Sir,\r\n\r\nHAVING, by the assistance of the Palmyrene numeral characters, lately\r\nmade a discovery, which may perhaps hereafter be of considerable\r\nservice to chronology; I could not longer defer, though now deeply\r\nengaged in other matters, communicating it to the Royal Society. Nor\r\nwill the memoir containing this, I flatter myself, be deemed altogether\r\nunworthy the attention of that learned and illustrious body. For,\r\nunless I am greatly deceived, it will bid fair to ascertain, with a\r\nsufficient degree of precision, the Phœnician dates of several antient\r\nSidonian coins, one of which was struck above a century before the\r\nbirth of CHRIST, hitherto utterly unknown; and evince the notation of\r\nthe Phœnicians, at least those of Sidon, when they first appeared, to\r\nhave been extremely similar to, if not nearly the same with, that of\r\nthe Palmyrenes.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nA small brass coin of Sidon[162], now in my possession, exhibits on the\r\nreverse three Phœnician letters, that form the word SIDON, over the\r\nprow of a ship, the usual symbol of the city wherein it was struck.\r\nThis coin, which is in good conservation, I formerly[163] published and\r\nexplained. The characters however in the exergue, which I could then\r\nmake nothing of, were not with sufficient accuracy described. This has\r\ninduced me to transmit you another draught of the same medal, wherein\r\nproper care has been taken to remedy that defect. The two first of\r\nthose characters, though somewhat imperfect, appear manifestly enough\r\nto be _Schin_ and _Tzade_; as the former occurs on the Palmyrene[164]\r\nmarbles, and the latter on several very valuable[165] Phœnician coins.\r\nThe others so nearly resemble the numeral characters of the Palmyrenes,\r\nthat they may undoubtedly be considered as pointing out to us a date.\r\nWhich if we admit, the _Schin_ and _Tzade_ will seem to be the initial\r\nletters of the words צה שנת, THE YEAR OF SIDON, or IN THE YEAR OF\r\nSIDON; as the elements _Pe_ and _Schin_ apparently denote שנת פסח, THE\r\nPASCHA OF THE YEAR, or IN THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR, on the reverse of\r\nthe famous Samaritan coin of Bologna, published by Sig. Bianconi[166]\r\nnot many years since. Nor can the phrase, THE YEAR OF SIDON, or IN THE\r\nYEAR OF SIDON, intimating the year of the proper æra of that city, be\r\nlooked upon as repugnant either to the Jewish or Phœnician genius; a\r\nsimilar expression having been used, both in their writings[167] and\r\non their coins[168], about the time that the Phœnician medal before\r\nme was struck, by the Jews. That the first of the numeral characters\r\nhere stands for TWENTY, we may infer from the correspondent one of the\r\nPalmyrenes, to the form of which it is by no means unlike. This will\r\nlikewise be confirmed by the dates preserved on other Phœnician coins,\r\nwhich will be immediately produced. The next, denoting a lesser number,\r\nand not representing FIVE, which we find always expressed by minute\r\nright lines on the Sidonian medals, must indubitably occupy the place\r\nof TEN. The six following strokes, after what has been just observed,\r\nwill be acknowleged to add SIX to the foregoing numbers; so that the\r\ninscription in the exergue will no longer remain a mystery, the whole\r\nonly importing, IN THE YEAR OF SIDON XXXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nI have three other coins of Sidon[169], of almost intirely the same\r\ntype; only one of them exhibits a date in Greek numerals, and two bear\r\nPhœnician dates. The Greek numerals are EOT, CCCLXXV; and the Phœnician\r\ncorrespond with the numbers CXX, CXXVII, to both of which are prefixed\r\nthe above-mentioned initial letters. We meet with draughts of two\r\nsimilar medals in[170] Arigoni, adorned with characters, expressing the\r\nnumbers CXXVIII, CXXX. All these coins present to our view a turrited\r\nhead and a branch of palm, pointing out to us the country to which they\r\nbelong, and on the reverse the usual symbol of Sidon. The year handed\r\ndown to us by the Greek date EOT, is the 375th of the æra of Seleucus;\r\nand those denoted by the Phœnician numerals answer to the 120th, 127th,\r\n128th, and 130th, of the proper æra of Sidon, as will be hereafter more\r\nfully evinced. Hence we may certainly collect, that these pieces were\r\nstruck at Sidon in the years of CHRIST 11, 18, 19, 21, and 64.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nThree coins of Sidon, different from the former, occur in[171] Sig.\r\nHaym, and seven[172] more in my little cabinet, whose type is\r\naltogether the same, with Phœnician dates, preceded by the two\r\naforesaid initial letters, upon them. To which we may add five,\r\npreserved in the noble[173] cabinet bequeathed to Christ-Church,\r\nOxon. by Archbishop Wake, and another in the valuable collection of\r\nthe Rev. Dr. Barton[174], Canon of the said collegiate church, and a\r\nworthy member of this Society. On one side these medals all exhibit\r\nthe head of Jupiter, and on the reverse the prow of a ship, the common\r\nsymbol of Sidon. Most of them had various Phœnician letters at first\r\nimprest on the upper part of the reverse, and one of them (which is\r\npretty remarkable) nearly the same characters there that appear in\r\nthe exergue. The first of the coins mentioned here was struck in the\r\nyear of Sidon 5. This has been perfectly well preserved, and is more\r\ncurious than any of the rest; which were emitted from the mint at Sidon\r\nin various years of the proper æra of that city, _viz._ the 107th,\r\n108th, 110th, 111th, 112th, 114th, 115th, 116th, 117th, and 119th. We\r\nmeet on none of these medals with the figure denoting TWENTY, used\r\nby the Sidonians, during the period I am now upon. It not a little\r\nresembles that which prevailed at Tadmor[175] in the reign of the\r\nemperor Claudius, about forty-nine years after the birth of CHRIST. The\r\nmost antient of the Phœnician coins I am now considering preceded the\r\ncommencement of the Christian æra 104 years, and is consequently 153\r\nyears older than the earliest Palmyrene inscription that has hitherto\r\ncome to our hands[176].\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nSome years since I published a small brass medal of Sidon[177], with\r\nthe heads of Jupiter and Juno on one side, and the prow of a ship\r\non the reverse; but did not accurately enough describe the numeral\r\ncharacters, and two initial letters, in the exergue. I therefore take\r\nthe liberty to send[178] you a new draught, perfectly well done,\r\nof that inscription. Two more coins of the same type I have since\r\nacquired, and another may be seen in[179] Sig. Haym. These four pieces\r\nonly exhibit the years of Sidon 125 and 132.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nMy small collection likewise affords two[180] other Phœnician medals\r\nof Sidon,[181] and Archbishop Wake’s noble cabinet one, of the same\r\ntype, with different Phœnician dates in the exergue. To these may be\r\nadded five, with the publication of which the learned world has been\r\nobliged by Sig. Arigoni[182]. The anterior faces of these coins are\r\nadorned with a veiled head, representing the genius of the city wherein\r\nthey were struck; and the reverses with a human figure leaning upon\r\na pillar, and holding a branch of palm in its right hand. Several\r\nPhœnician letters also there appear, which may perhaps at first sight\r\nseem to render it somewhat doubtful, whether the medals belong to\r\nSidon or not. But every suspicion arising from hence must immediately\r\nvanish, when we cast our eyes upon the two initial elements, and the\r\nnumeral characters, in the exergue; which clearly enough indicate the\r\npieces to have been struck at Sidon, in the 83d, 87th, 95th, 105th,\r\n106th, 108th, 114th, and 116th years of the æra peculiar to that city.\r\nA Phœnician coin of Sidon likewise occurs in one[183] of Sig. Arigoni’s\r\nplates, and another[184] in my collection, with the turrited head and\r\nbranch of palm visible on three of the[185] medals above described,\r\nwhich indisputably appertain to that city, together with the very\r\nPhœnician letters and symbol imprest on the Sidonian coins now before\r\nme. This, exclusive of other considerations, that might be offered,\r\nmust set the point I am here insisting upon beyond dispute.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nI have another brass Phœnician medal of Sidon[186], not a little\r\nresembling those above-mentioned, both in workmanship and size,\r\npresenting to our view on one side the head of Jupiter, and on the\r\nother a human figure with a lance in its right hand. This coin, which\r\nhas never yet been published, is adorned with a Phœnician legend\r\non the reverse, different from those of all the others that have\r\nhitherto appeared. I therefore judged that a draught of it would not\r\nbe unacceptable, though the date imprest originally in the exergue\r\n(answering to the 26th year of Sidon) has a little suffered from the\r\ninjuries of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nThe next Phœnician medal of Sidon, which I shall take the liberty here\r\nto describe, is a small brass one[187], now in my hands, with a veiled\r\nhead on the anterior face, and the prow of a ship on the reverse.\r\nM. Bouterouë[188], who has published it, rightly asserts it to be a\r\nPhœnician coin. The year of Sidon, preserved in the exergue of mine,\r\nis 74; and that in the exergue of M. Bouterouë’s, 73, though the first\r\nnumeral character of the latter is somewhat deformed.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nThe last Phœnician medals I shall at present produce, in order to\r\nsettle the point in view, are[189] two in my possession, intirely\r\nagreeing both in type and form, as remarkable as any of the others here\r\ntouched upon. A similar coin has been published by Sig. Arigoni[190],\r\nand another[191] by M. Bouterouë; both of which, on several accounts,\r\nmerit the attention of the learned. They exhibit on one side the\r\nhead of Jupiter laureated, with a beard; and on the reverse a double\r\ncornucopia, together with three or four Phœnician elements, one or\r\ntwo of which are in a great measure defaced. A brass medal of Sidon\r\noccurs in Archbishop Wake’s[192] collection, as well as one in[193]\r\nmine, with the head of Jupiter done exactly after the same manner\r\nas that on the pieces before me, and Europa carried by a bull on\r\nthe reverse; which, exclusive of the inscriptions in the exergue,\r\ndemonstrate the latter to belong to Sidon. The first of mine was struck\r\nin the 143d year of the proper æra of that city, and the second five\r\nyears after. They correct the barbarous date assigned by Sig. Arigoni\r\nto his coin. M. Bouterouë has not favoured the learned world with an\r\nexplication of the medal, of which he has given us a draught. Nor has\r\nM. l’Abbé Barthelemy, who likewise mentions this very coin, informed\r\nus to what place it appertains; but contented himself with barely[194]\r\nobserving, that the letters preserved on the reverse are Phœnician. I\r\nflatter myself therefore that I shall not be charged with plagiarism\r\nby this celebrated antiquary, in case what is here submitted to the\r\nconsideration of the Royal Society should be so happy as to meet with\r\nthe approbation of that learned and illustrious body; not even by\r\n_only_ acquainting the public, with a sort of _politesse_ so peculiar\r\nto his countrymen, that it is now become one of the most distinguishing\r\ncharacteristics of their nation[195], “that a certain Oxford doctor has\r\ndone him the honour to _adopt_ the explication he had given.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nFor the farther illustration of what has been here advanced, it will\r\nbe requisite to observe, that two æra’s were antiently followed at\r\nSidon; the æra of Seleucus, and another peculiar to the inhabitants\r\nof that city[196]. On the Greek brass coins of Sidon, according to\r\nF. Frœlich[197], both these epochs seem to have been used. However,\r\nthe supputation pointed out to us by the date on the Greek medal\r\nabove-mentioned was undoubtedly made according to the æra of Seleucus;\r\nsince otherwise the year exhibited by that date must have been nearly\r\ncoincident with the 266th of CHRIST, which by those versed in this kind\r\nof literature will never be allowed. For had the piece presented to\r\nour view so recent a date, as Sidon first became a Roman colony in the\r\nreign of Elagabalus[198], above forty years before; the reverse ought\r\nto have been adorned with some other letters intimating this, as were\r\nthose of the Sidonian[199] coins posterior to that event. As certain\r\nis it that all the Phœnician medals of Sidon, whose numeral characters\r\nhave been interpreted here, acknowledge no other epoch than the proper\r\none of that city, which commenced in the year[200] of Rome 643. This, I\r\nflatter myself, from the following considerations, exclusive of others\r\nthat might, with equal facility, be offered, will even to demonstration\r\nappear.\r\n\r\n1. The fifth year mentioned by the oldest of these coins cannot be\r\nthe fifth year of the æra of Seleucus, because the Sidonians were\r\nthen subject to Antigonus[201], in whose territories the supputation\r\naccording to that epoch did not take place; and consequently the piece\r\nitself must have been struck in the fifth year of the proper æra of\r\nSidon, nearly coincident with the 648th of Rome[202].\r\n\r\n2. No dates ever occurred upon the medals of the Syrian kings presiding\r\nover the people of Sidon, either to F. Frœlich or Dr. Vaillant[203],\r\nwho have so eminently distinguished themselves in this branch of\r\nliterature, before the year of Seleucus 112; and therefore neither\r\nthe Phœnician dates preserved on the aforesaid Sidonian coins whose\r\nnumeral characters do not amount to 112, nor the Greek dates on others\r\nfalling short of that number, can rationally be supposed to bear any\r\nrelation to the æra of that prince. This certainly must be considered\r\nas a strong presumption, or rather an incontestable proof, that the\r\nlast-mentioned Phœnician dates were deduced from the commencement of\r\nthe proper Sidonian epoch, as from their genuine cardinal point. Which\r\nreasoning will by analogy extend, as the numeral characters exhibited\r\nby all the coins here explained are of the same kind, to every one of\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\n3. None of the medals of the Syrian kings, with Phœnician letters\r\nupon them[204], hitherto published, bear any Phœnician dates. This,\r\nafter what has been said, renders it extremely probable, that the\r\npieces of Sidon I am considering were posterior to those coins; and\r\neven that their Phœnician dates referred to an æra different from that\r\nof Seleucus, followed by the Greek dates on the medals of the Syrian\r\nkings. Which if we admit, this æra could have been no other than the\r\nnew one of the Sidonians, that commenced in the seventh century of Rome.\r\n\r\n4. That the dates visible on these coins were supputed according to\r\nthe latter epoch of Sidon, will be manifest from an examination of\r\nthe Greek and Phœnician brass medals of that city explained, in[205]\r\nthe beginning of this paper; whose type and workmanship are extremely\r\nsimilar, if not almost intirely the same. For this circumstance is\r\nto me an evident proof, that they could not have been struck at very\r\ndistant times. Now if we take the Greek coin to have followed the æra\r\nof Seleucus, as was undoubtedly the case, and the others that peculiar\r\nto Sidon; the first of the Phœnician dates[206] will not be prior to\r\nthe Greek one above fifty-three years, nor the last of them precede it\r\nabove forty-three years. Whereas if we suppose the numeral inscriptions\r\nin the exergues of the Phœnician Sidonian coins to have been supputed\r\naccording to the Seleucian epoch, the difference between the aforesaid\r\ndates will be five times as much; which with the similarity of\r\nworkmanship and type, already observed, will be altogether incompatible.\r\n\r\n5. As the Jews[207], about the time that the first of our medals was\r\nstruck, denominated the æra of Seleucus, THE ÆRA OF THE KINGDOM OF\r\nTHE GREEKS; we cannot well doubt but it went amongst the Sidonians,\r\nwho were neighbours to the Jews, under the same denomination. From\r\nwhence it will follow, that the epoch styled by them emphatically, THE\r\nÆRA OF SIDON, must have been different from the æra of Seleucus; and\r\nconsequently that which, after the 643d year of Rome, was peculiar to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Philos. Trans. Vol. L._ TAB. XXXII. _p. 804_\r\n\r\nPHŒNICIAN Numerals antiently used at SIDON, from _One_ to a _Thousand_.\r\n\r\n_J. Mynde sc._]\r\n\r\nThe powers of the Phœnician numeral characters antiently used at Sidon,\r\nwhich I flatter myself are now discovered, having been for many ages\r\nunknown; the Society will perhaps not be displeased to see accurate\r\ndraughts of the principal Phœnician medals, from whence they are\r\ndeduced. I have therefore taken the liberty to transmit them[208] such\r\ndraughts, which may be intirely depended upon. I have also constructed\r\na table[209] of the numeral characters themselves, from UNITY TO A\r\nTHOUSAND; which will demonstrate, in the clearest manner possible, the\r\ngreat affinity between them and those of the Palmyrenes.\r\n\r\n1. From this table it plainly appears, that the people of Sidon had\r\nno particular character to denote Five, whilst the Phœnician numerals\r\nhere explained were in vogue amongst them; that they expressed TWENTY\r\nby a character, during that period, not very different from the\r\ncorrespondent one used at Tadmor; and that in all other respects the\r\nPhœnician notation then prevailing at Sidon was, in a manner, the same\r\nwith that of the[210] Palmyrenes.\r\n\r\n2. It may not be improper to observe, that two of the Sidonian coins I\r\nhave been considering[211] exhibit the Phœnician word מא, equivalent\r\nto the Hebrew מאה, and Syriac מאא, AN HUNDRED, instead of the centenary\r\nnumeral character. This, in conjunction with the appearance of that\r\ncharacter, occupying the very place of the term אמ, on others of those\r\ncoins, first induced me to believe, that the inscription preserved by\r\nevery one of them in the exergue could be nothing else but a date.\r\n\r\n3. I shall beg leave farther to remark, that none of the indubitable\r\nmedals of Tyre, adorned with Phœnician letters, as far as I have been\r\nable to discover, present to our view any Phœnician dates at all.\r\nThis still more clearly evinces the second element prefixed to the\r\nPhœnician numerals in the exergue to point out to us the city of Sidon,\r\nand not that of Tyre; which[212], indeed, seems already to have been\r\nsufficiently proved.\r\n\r\n4. From the foregoing observations we may likewise collect, that\r\nthe coin assigned to Demetrius III. by Mr. Masson, F. Frœlich[213],\r\nand Sig. Haym, exhibiting a Phœnician legend, without a Phœnician\r\ndate, in the exergue, ought in reality to be attributed to Demetrius\r\nI. Those three learned men therefore have been guilty of a mistake in\r\nthis particular. Nor can the head on this medal be denied to bear some\r\nresemblance to that of Demetrius I.[214] with a moderate beard, as it\r\nappears on a coin published by Dr. Vaillant, and in one of F. Frœlich’s\r\nplates. That the letters A K, behind the head, indicate the piece\r\nto have been struck in the twenty-first year of the proper Sidonian\r\næra[215], as Mr. Masson and F. Frœlich are pleased to assert, can never\r\nbe proved. On the contrary, the improbability of such a notion may be\r\ninferred from two similar letters, behind the turrited head of the _Dea\r\nSyria_[216], on a Phœnician coin, which Mr. Masson makes to point out\r\nthe forty-first year of the proper epoch of Sidon; whereas, in truth,\r\nthat piece seems to have been struck either in the reign of Demetrius\r\nI. or Antiochus IV.[217] many years before. Nay, that it was actually\r\nstruck when Demetrius I. sat upon the Syrian throne, is rendered almost\r\nincontestable by a medal of that prince now in my possession, with a\r\n_Beta_ behind the head on the anterior part, and the very reverse of\r\nthe last-mentioned coin. From the former of which circumstances it\r\nfarther appears, that the alphabetic characters MA, supposed by Mr.\r\nMasson to denote 41, are by no means to be taken for a date. To which\r\nwe may add, that the head on a Phœnician medal, with the two Greek\r\nelements AK behind it, published by Mr. Reland[218], is apparently that\r\nof Demetrius I.; and that the posterior part of this coin is nearly\r\nthe same, in all respects, with the reverse of that supposed to[219]\r\nappertain to Demetrius III. by Mr. Masson and Sig. Haym. But to wave\r\nall other considerations, relative to the point in view, that may\r\noccur, the features and turns of the face on the medals of Demetrius\r\nIII. are so different[220], that no inference of any validity can be\r\ndrawn from the pretended identity or similitude of them, in support of\r\nMr. Masson’s opinion.\r\n\r\n5. The Palmyrene and Phœnician numerals, deduced from coins and\r\ninscriptions, may perhaps be thought not unworthy a place amongst the\r\narithmetical characters of various nations, formerly[221] collected\r\nby Bishop Beveridge; and consequently may be allowed to render\r\nsomewhat more complete the chronological institutions, or rather the\r\nchronological arithmetic, of that learned and judicious author.\r\n\r\nYou will pardon the prolixity of this letter, which the novelty of\r\nthe subject may perhaps render a little more excusable than it would\r\notherwise have been; and believe me to be, with the most perfect\r\nconsideration and esteem,\r\n\r\n                                 SIR,\r\n                  Your most obedient humble Servant,\r\n                              J.

Astronomer Royal, F.R.S. and Member of the Royal\r\nAcademy of Sciences at_ Paris; _by Mr._ Charles Walmesley, _F.R.S.\r\nand Member of the Royal Academy of Sciences at_ Berlin, _and of the\r\nInstitute of_ Bologna.\r\n\r\n[Read Dec. 14, 1758.]\r\n\r\nReverend Sir,\r\n\r\nSINCE the time that astronomers have been enabled by the perfection of\r\ntheir instruments to determine with great accuracy the motions of the\r\ncelestial bodies, they have been solicitous to separate and distinguish\r\nthe several inequalities discovered in these motions, and to know their\r\ncause, quantity, and the laws according to which they are generated.\r\nThis seems to furnish a sufficient motive to mathematicians, wherever\r\nthere appears a cause capable of producing an alteration in those\r\nmotions, to examine by theory what the result may amount to, though\r\nit comes out never so small: for as one can seldom depend securely\r\nupon mere guess for the quantity of any effect, it must be a blameable\r\nneglect entirely to overlook it without being previously certain of its\r\nnot being worth our notice.\r\n\r\nFinding therefore it had not been considered what effect the figure\r\nof a planet differing from that of a sphere might produce in the\r\nmotion of a satellite revolving about it, and as it is the case of the\r\nbodies of the Earth and Jupiter which have satellites about them, not\r\nto be spherical but spheroidical, I thought it worth while to enter\r\nupon the examination of such a problem. When the primary planet is an\r\nexact globe, it is well known that the force by which the revolving\r\nsatellite is retained in its orbit, tends to the center of the planet,\r\nand varies in the inverse ratio of the square of the distance from\r\nit; but when the primary planet is of a spheroidical figure, the\r\nsame rule then no longer holds: the gravity of the satellite is no\r\nmore directed to the center of the planet, nor does it vary in the\r\nproportion above-mentioned; and if the plane of the satellite’s orbit\r\nbe not the same with the plane of the planet’s equator, the protuberant\r\nmatter about the equator will by a constant effort of its attraction\r\nendeavour to make the two planes coincide. Hence the regularity of\r\nthe satellite’s motion is necessarily disturbed, and though upon\r\nexamination this effect is found to be but small in the moon, the\r\nfigure of the earth differing so little from that of a sphere, yet in\r\nsome cases it may be thought worth notice; if not, it will be at least\r\na satisfaction to see that what is neglected can be of no consequence.\r\nBut however inconsiderable the change may be with regard to the moon,\r\nit becomes very sensible in the motions of the satellites of Jupiter\r\nboth on account of their nearer distances to that planet when compared\r\nwith its semidiameter, as also because the figure of Jupiter so far\r\nrecedes from that of a sphere. This I have shewn and exemplified in\r\nthe fourth satellite; in which case indeed the computation is more\r\nexact than it would be for the other satellites: for as my first design\r\nwas to examine only how far the moon’s motion could be affected by\r\nthis cause, I supposed the satellite to revolve at a distance somewhat\r\nremote from the primary planet, and the difference of the equatoreal\r\ndiameter and the axis of the planet not to be very considerable. There\r\nlikewise arises this other advantage from the present theory, that\r\nit furnishes means to settle more accurately the proportion of the\r\ndifferent forces which disturb the celestial motions, by assigning the\r\nparticular share of influence which is to be ascribed to the figure of\r\nthe central bodies round which those motions are performed.\r\n\r\nI have added at the end a proposition concerning the diurnal motion\r\nof the earth. This motion has been generally esteemed to be exactly\r\nuniform; but as there is a cause that must necessarily somewhat alter\r\nit, I was glad to examine what that alteration could amount to. If we\r\nfirst suppose the globe of the earth to be exactly spherical, revolving\r\nabout its axis in a given time, and afterwards conceive that by the\r\nforce of the sun or moon raising the waters its figure be changed into\r\nthat of a spheroid, then according as the axis of revolution becomes a\r\ndifferent diameter of the spheroid, the velocity of the revolution must\r\nincrease or diminish: for, since some parts of the terraqueous globe\r\nare removed from the axis of revolution and others depressed towards\r\nit, and that in a different proportion as the sun or moon approaches\r\nto or recedes from the equator, when the whole quantity of motion\r\nwhich always remains the same is distributed through the spheroid, the\r\nvelocity of the diurnal rotation cannot be constantly the same. This\r\nvariation however will scarce be observable, but as it is real, it may\r\nnot be thought amiss to determine what its precise quantity is.\r\n\r\nI am sensible the following theory, as far as it relates to the motion\r\nof Jupiter’s satellites, is imperfect and might be prosecuted further;\r\nbut being hindered at present from such pursuit by want of health and\r\nother occupations, I thought I might send it you in the condition it\r\nhas lain by me for some time. You can best judge how far it may be of\r\nuse, and what advantage might arise from further improvements in it. I\r\nam glad to have this opportunity of giving a fresh testimony of that\r\nregard which is due to your distinguished merit, and of professing\r\nmyself with the highest esteem,\r\n\r\n                             Reverend Sir,\r\n                       Your very humble Servant,\r\n                             C.

By_ J.\r\nWall, _M. D. In a Letter to the Rev._ Charles Lyttelton, _LL.D. Dean\r\nof_ Exeter.\r\n\r\n[Read Dec. 14, 1758.]\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nTHE history of the Norfolk Boy, which, you inform me, has been\r\ncommunicated to the Royal Society, seems to deserve a place in the\r\nmemoirs of that illustrious body, as well on account of its utility, as\r\nits singularity.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms in this case most evidently arose from worms in the\r\nintestines; which often occasion unaccountable complaints, and\r\nfrequently elude the most powerful medicines, as they did in the\r\ninstance before us, till at last they were dislodged by the enormous\r\nquantity of oil-paint, which the poor boy devoured; and the cause being\r\nthus removed, all the effects ceased.\r\n\r\nAt first sight it appears wonderful, that this immense quantity of\r\nwhite lead did not prove fatal; and that it was not so, could be owing\r\nto nothing but the oil, by which it was enveloped, and its contact and\r\nimmediate action on the coats of the intestines thereby prevented. But\r\nthe oil did not only obviate the dangerous effects of this mixture, but\r\nappears, to me at least, to have been the chief cause of the success,\r\nwith which it was happily attended. I speak this with some restriction,\r\nbecause the lead, as its stypticity was thus covered, might, by its\r\nweight, assist in removing the verminous filth, especially as the\r\nbowels were made slippery by the oil.\r\n\r\nOil has long been observed to be noxious to insects of all kinds, so\r\nthat not only those, which survive after being cut into several pieces,\r\nbut those also, which live long with very little air, and those, which\r\nrevive by warmth after submersion in water, die irrecoverably, if they\r\nare immerged in, or covered with oil. Rhedi and Malpighi have made many\r\nexperiments to this purpose; and account for the event very rationally\r\nfrom the oil stopping up all the air-vessels, which in these animalcula\r\nare very numerous, and distributed almost over their whole bodies.\r\n\r\nOn this account oil has been recommended as a vermifuge both by Andry\r\nand Hoffmann, though I believe it has been seldom used in practice in\r\nthat intention; or at least has not been given in quantities sufficient\r\nto answer it. Indeed Hoffmann[222] himself seems not to lay much\r\nstress on it as an anthelmintic, recommending it only as serving\r\nto line the inside of the intestines, and to relax spasms in them;\r\nand therefore as a proper preparative to be given before any acrid\r\npurgatives are ventured on.\r\n\r\nThe medicines commonly prescribed, and most depended on, are either\r\nof a virulent and drastic nature, or such as are supposed to be able\r\nto destroy those animals by some mechanical qualities _e. g._ to cut,\r\ntear, or otherwise affect their tender bodies, and yet not have force\r\nenough to lacerate or injure the stomach or intestines. Of the former\r\nkind are the leaves and juice of helleboraster, the bark of the Indian\r\ncabbage-tree, coloquintida, resin of jalap, glass of antimony, and\r\nthe like; the effects of which are commonly violent and dangerous,\r\nand sometimes fatal. Of the latter class are crude mercury, and the\r\nmilder preparations of that mineral, aloes and other bitters, tin\r\nfilings, neutral salts, and vitriolic acids. Every one conversant in\r\npractice too well knows, how often these medicines are administred\r\nineffectually. When I had therefore attentively considered the history\r\nof the Norfolk Boy, I determined to try the efficacy of oil in such\r\ncases, as it seemed capable of producing great effects, and yet could\r\nnot be attended with any hazard or danger.\r\n\r\nThe first person, to whom it was given, with this view, was ----\r\n----, a patient of our Infirmary, who was judged to have worms, but\r\nhad taken several approved medicines for a considerable time without\r\nsuccess. In a consultation with the other physicians, the following\r\nform was prescribed.\r\n\r\n  ℞. _Ol. Oliv. lb.ss. Sp. vol. aromat. ʒij M. cap. Cochl. iii. mane et\r\n  H. S._\r\n\r\nThe volatile spirit was added here to make the oil saponaceous, and\r\nby that means more easily miscible with the juices in the stomach and\r\n_primæ viæ_. This medicine answered our expectations, and in a few days\r\nbrought away several worms.\r\n\r\n---- Lacy, a poor boy of the parish of Feckenham in this county, aged\r\n13 years, was, as I was informed, about three or four years ago seized\r\nwith convulsive fits, which gradually deprived him of his senses, and\r\nreduced him to a state of idiocy. He had taken several anthelmintics\r\nand purgatives, particularly the _Pulv. Cornachin._ but never had\r\nvoided any worms, though all the symptoms seemed plainly to shew, that\r\nthey were the cause of his disorder. As he greedily swallowed any\r\nthing, which was offered him, without distinction, I at first ordered\r\nhim a mixture of linseed oil ℥vij _Tinct. sacr._ ℥j: of which he took\r\nfour large spoonfuls night and morning. He persisted in the use of this\r\none whole week without at all nauseating it, towards the latter end of\r\nwhich time he voided one round worm of a great length. He now began\r\nto shew much aversion to the medicine; on which account the _Tinctur.\r\nsacr._ was omitted, and he was ordered to take the oil alone in the\r\nsame quantities. This he continued to do a fortnight longer, during\r\nwhich time he voided 60 more worms, and in a great measure recovered\r\nthe use of his reason[223]. This account I had from the Apothecary,\r\nwho, by my directions, supplied him with the medicines.\r\n\r\nSoon after this I ordered the same medicine to be given to Elizabeth\r\nAbell, a poor girl in the same neighbourhood, reduced by epileptic fits\r\nto such a state of idiocy, as to eat her own excrements. It caused her\r\nto void several worms, but she did not recover her senses.\r\n\r\nSince this time I have given the oil to several persons with good\r\nsuccess, and therefore I cannot but recommend a further tryal of it;\r\nsince it is a remedy, which may be used with safety in almost any\r\nquantity; a character, which very few of the anthelmintic medicines\r\ndeserve.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, that some oils are more destructive to worms than\r\nothers. Andry (_Traité de la Generation des Vers, cap. 8_) prefers\r\nnut oil, and tells us, that a human worm, voided alive, being put\r\ninto that oil, died instantly; whereas another worm, voided at the\r\nsame time, lived several hours in oil of sweet almonds, though in a\r\nlanguishing state. This difference he afterwards (_Cap. 9_) endeavours\r\nto account for, by supposing, that the oil of almonds is more porous,\r\nand consequently less able to preclude the entrance of air into the\r\nworms. And indeed there is some reason to conclude, that oils, which\r\ndry in the open air, such as nut and linseed oils, are of a closer\r\ntexture, less mixed with water, and consequently more anthelmintic,\r\nthan those oils, which freeze by cold, and will not dry in the open\r\nair;[224] such as those from olives or almonds. Andry tells us, that at\r\nMilan the mothers have a custom to give their children once or twice\r\na week toasts dipt in nut oil, with a little wine, to kill the worms:\r\nand I know a lady in the country, who gives the poor children in her\r\nneighbourhood the same oil with great success.\r\n\r\nI would recommend this remedy to be used in as large doses as the\r\nstomach will well bear: to which purpose it may be adviseable to join\r\nit either with aromatics, bitters, or essential oils, such as the\r\ncase may require. Andry orders the oil to be taken fasting, assigning\r\nthis for a reason, that the stomach being then most empty, it more\r\nreadily embraces and stifles the worms. During this course it will be\r\nnecessary, at proper intervals, to give rhubarb, mercurial or aloetic\r\nmedicines.\r\n\r\nI cannot close this paper without observing, that, from the history\r\nof the Norfolk Boy, we may learn, in similar cases, where the head is\r\nnot idiopathic, never to despair absolutely of a cure, notwithstanding\r\nthe disease has been of very long standing. For in this boy, though\r\nthe oppression in the brain and nerves had continued many years, and\r\nhad been so violent, as to deprive him not only of his intellectual\r\nfaculties, but almost all his sensations; yet were not the organs much\r\nimpaired thereby, but he recovered all his senses again, as soon as\r\nthe irritation and spasms in the intestines, which first caused all\r\nthese terrible symptoms, were removed. The same thing in a less degree\r\nwas observable in the Feckenham Boy, mentioned before; and we have had\r\ntwo remarkable instances of the same kind at the Worcester Infirmary;\r\nwhere a boy and his sister, of the name of Moyses, received a perfect\r\ncure, and recovered the entire use of their senses, after having been\r\nrendered idiots (though not in so high a degree as the Norfolk Boy) for\r\nmore than two years, by epileptic fits proceeding from worms.\r\n\r\n                                                               J. Wall.\r\n\r\nWorcester Dec. 7, 1748.\r\n\r\n  _P. S._ As the following history has some analogy with the subject we\r\n  are now upon, I beg leave to subjoin it by way of postscript.\r\n\r\n   A young girl of the name of Lowbridge, at Ledbury, in\r\n  Herefordshire, nine years old, had been long troubled with a gnawing\r\n  pain at the stomach, which growing gradually more violent, I was at\r\n  last called to her. About a quarter of an hour before I reached the\r\n  house, she was seized with a violent vomiting, whereby she brought\r\n  up an amazing number of living animals supposed, to be upwards of\r\n  a thousand, together with a vast quantity of clear viscid phlegm.\r\n  In shape they exactly resembled millepedes, except that some of\r\n  them, being examined by a magnifying glass, appeared to have a\r\n  small filament, which arose from the middle of the belly, and might\r\n  probably have served to fix them to their nidus. They were of\r\n  different sizes, from that of the largest millepede, to some, that\r\n  were scarce perceptible; so that they appeared to have been generated\r\n  at different times, and grown in the stomach. As the child was\r\n  suddenly seized with this effort to vomit, she discharged her stomach\r\n  on the floor of the parlour where she was sitting. The millepedes,\r\n  they told me, were at first very lively, and crept briskly different\r\n  ways; but they did not live long in the open air. They were lying in\r\n  the slime when I came to her, so that I could not be imposed on as to\r\n  the verity of the fact. After this evacuation, the child’s stomach\r\n  grew perfectly easy, and continued so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXII. _Observations upon the_ Corona Solis Marina Americana; _The_\r\nAmerican Sea-Sun-Crown. _By_ John Andrew Peyssonel, _M.D. F.R.S.\r\nTranslated from the_ French.\r\n\r\n[Read Dec. 14, 1758.]\r\n\r\nI Shall call this insect by this name, because of the resemblance it\r\nbears to the flower called _Corona Solis_; since it is, like this, open\r\nand spread.\r\n\r\nThis insect adheres to the rocks by its basis, which is flat and round;\r\nand tho’ this roundness is sometimes mis-shapen, it is only occasioned\r\nby the inequalities of the rocks, to which it sticks. Its diameter is\r\nabout two or three inches, bearing, from the center, certain rays,\r\nlike white nerves, upon a moist flesh, of a livid violet colour.\r\nThese rays or nerves pass from the centre to the circumference; they,\r\ntoo, consist of a soft fleshy substance, which resembles bowels or\r\nintestines; the whole length of which is covered with glandulous bodies\r\nof a dirty grey colour; and all these glands filled up the middle of\r\nthe fish, making the flowrets, or petals, that form the disk of the\r\nflowers. There is an infinite number of these glands attached to those\r\nfilets or nerves, all very distinct from one another: these filets are\r\nwell ranged when viewed downwards; but the upper part is covered by\r\nthese glands, which are placed in a confused manner. These filets pass\r\nto the circumference, forming an edge full of rugosities, which leaves\r\nthe body of the animal full of flaws. These hard bodies, upon which\r\nit lives, are not always permanent in the same place, but capable of\r\nchanging their places from this edge or circumference; like a skin or\r\ntexture of fibres or flesh, such as the body of the sea snail I have\r\nalready described; of the same thickness, of a greenish colour, and\r\nsometimes of a greenish spotted grey, without shell, bone, or stay. The\r\nbody or muscular fleshy skin raises itself up perpendicularly to three\r\ninches; rounds itself at the top, when it is touched; but it leaves\r\na hole like a sphincter, formed by the reunion of the fleshy body,\r\nwhich enlarges itself again. The base opens to the whole extent of the\r\nbottom, makes a reversed prepuce, and immediately brings to view three\r\nrows of _papillæ_, which are of a conical figure, of one or two lines\r\nlong, resembling the glands under the tongues of oxen, and which may\r\nhere be compared to the demi-flowers or radiated flowers of the _Corona\r\nSolis_.\r\n\r\nAfter this threefold ray of conical pointed _papillæ_, there appears a\r\nbody of a livid violet colour; I took it for a particular substance\r\nor body; but having examined it, I observed it was only a pellicle,\r\nor membrane, that covered a part of the _papillæ_ I mentioned. This\r\nmembrane has sixteen separations, which form kinds of purses, and yet\r\nleave, in the center of the animal, an empty space, wherein several\r\nglands are brought in view. I do not know, whether, in the natural\r\nstate, these membranes do not retire to the circumference, in order to\r\ndiscover the glands within, which they usually hide, and which fill\r\nup all the middle of the crown; but when the fleshy body is gone up\r\nagain, it covers all the interior parts, closes them in, and preserves\r\nthem from the touch of any extraneous body. I cannot tell how these\r\nfishes live, or what is their mechanism; for I could not distinguish\r\neither a mouth, or any _viscera_, nor any other organ serving to their\r\nnourishment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Philos.

In a Letter to\r\nMr._ Isaac Romilly, _F.R.S. from_ John Ellis, _Esq; F.R.S._\r\n\r\n[Read Dec. 21, 1758.]\r\n\r\n                                                 London, Dec. 21. 1758.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nTHOSE rare and very extraordinary new species of Barnacles, which you\r\nhave lately received from abroad, are so different from any of the\r\ncommon species, that I have seen, that I was resolved to inquire into\r\nthe nature of an animal, which, like a Proteus, appears in so many\r\ndifferent shapes or coverings in different parts of the world. For this\r\nend I have consulted that excellent collection in the British Museum,\r\nand some others in the cabinets of my curious friends.\r\n\r\nIn this inquiry I met with some very rare ones, which have not yet\r\nbeen described, as you will observe in the annexed plate [_See_ TAB.\r\nXXXIV.], where I have given exact drawings of yours, as well as the\r\nother species of this genus.\r\n\r\nThis marine animal is called, by writers on natural history, Balanus,\r\nand Concha Anatifera: but the celebrated Professor at Upsal, Dr.\r\nLinnæus, calls the internal active part, or fish, the Animal Triton,\r\nand the covering or testaceous habitation Lepas, which he says is a\r\nmultivalved shell, composed of unequal valves. The Animal Triton he\r\ndescribes, as having an oblong body, a mouth with a tongue in it,\r\ntwisted about in a spiral manner; sixteen tentacula or claws: six of\r\nthe hinder ones on each side, he says, are cheliferous.\r\n\r\nThis account differing from that given by the ingenious Mr. Turberville\r\nNeedham, F.R.S. in his Microscopical Essays, I shall give the character\r\nof this animal, as it appeared to me from the many observations I made\r\non it, while alive in salt water; and these I compared not only with\r\nmany dried specimens of other varieties, but likewise with some of\r\nyours, that were preserved in spirits; and I found that the parts of\r\nthe animal agree in all the species.\r\n\r\nThe experiments, that I made, were on the common English Barnacle,\r\nwhich is very frequently met with, at this time of the year, on oysters\r\nand other shell-fish. The microscope, that I made use of to observe\r\nit, was Mr. Cuff’s aquatic one; where the animal, when taken out of the\r\nshell, may be put into the watch-glass with salt water, or spread on\r\nthe round glass plate on the stage of the microscope, and kept moist\r\nwith a hair pencil and salt water during the time of observation: this\r\nwill keep the claws and proboscis alive and in motion for many hours\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThis animal has 24 claws, or cirrhi (_See Fig._ A), which are disposed\r\nin the following manner: the 12 longest stand erect, arising from the\r\nback part of the animal: they are all joined in pairs near the bottom,\r\nand inserted in one common base. These appear like so many yellow\r\ncurled feathers: they are clear, horny, and articulated. Every joint is\r\nfurnished with two rows of hairs on the concave side. The animal, in\r\norder to catch its prey, is continually extending and contracting these\r\narched hairy claws, which serve it for a net.\r\n\r\nThe 12 smallest claws are placed next to these, six on each side: these\r\nare divided into pairs; that is, two claws to one stem, like the chelæ\r\nor claws of the crab. These are more pliable, and fuller of hairs, than\r\nthe others, and seem to do the office of hands for the animal.\r\n\r\nThe whole number of claws lessen in size gradually each way, from the\r\ntallest in the back, to the last but one of each side in the front;\r\nwhich last two are of the middle size.\r\n\r\nThe proboscis, or trunk, rises from the middle of the base of the\r\nlarger claws, and is longer than any of them: this the animal moves\r\nabout in any direction with great agility: it is of a tubular figure,\r\ntransparent, composed of rings lessening gradually to the extremity,\r\nwhere it is surrounded with a circle of small bristles, which likewise\r\nare moveable at the will of the animal. These, with other small hairs\r\non the trunk, disappear when it dies.\r\n\r\nAlong the inside of this transparent proboscis the spiral dark-coloured\r\ntongue appears very plain: this the animal contracts and extends at\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nThe mouth appears like that of a contracted purse, and is placed\r\nin front, between the fore claws. In the folds of this membraneous\r\nsubstance are six or eight horny laminæ or teeth standing erect, each\r\nhaving a tendon proper to direct its motion. Some of these teeth are\r\nserrated, others have tufts of sharp hairs instead of indentations on\r\nthe convex side, that point down into the mouth; so that no animalcule\r\nthat becomes their prey can escape back.\r\n\r\nUnder the mouth lie the stomach, intestines, and the tendons by which\r\nthey adhere to the shell.\r\n\r\nThis then is the general character of the animal of the whole genus,\r\nwhether with stems or without.\r\n\r\nI shall now give you a short description of the several kinds I have\r\nmet with, besides those of your own, and shall divide them into two\r\nkinds; those that have stems, and those that adhere by their shelly\r\nbases.\r\n\r\nThe first and most remarkable of those that have stems is the Barnacle,\r\n_Fig._ 1. This differs from the Lepas of Linnæus in not having a\r\ntestaceous, only a cartilaginous or fleshy covering. On the top of it\r\nare two erect tubular figures like ears: these have a communication\r\nwith the internal parts of the animal (_See Fig. 1. b_). These inner\r\nparts agree with the general character already given. The stem, which\r\nis here dissected, was full of a soft spongy yellow substance, which\r\nappeared, when magnified, to consist of regular oval figures, connected\r\ntogether by many small fibres, and no doubt are the spawn of the animal.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary animal (of which there were seven together) was\r\nfound sticking to the Whale Barnacle (_See fig._ 1. & 7.), by Mr. Smith\r\nof Stavenger in Norway, who cut both kinds together off a whale’s\r\nlip, that was thrown upon that coast last year, 1757, and immediately\r\nimmersed them in spirits of wine; by which means we have been able more\r\nexactly to describe them.\r\n\r\nI have called this animal the Naked Fleshy Barnacle with Ears; but it\r\nappears to claim the name of Triton rather than Lepas, according to\r\nLinnæus, as having no shelly habitation.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 2. is the next animal of this class: this is not yet described.\r\nI found several of them sticking to the Warted Norway Sea Fan, which\r\nDr. Pantoppidan, the Bishop of North Bergen, sent you: from its\r\nappearance, I have called it the Norway Sea Fan Penknife. The stem\r\nof this is covered with little testaceous scales. The upper part of\r\nthe animal is inclosed in thirteen distinct shells, six on each side,\r\nbesides the hinge-shell at the back, which is common to both sides:\r\nthese are connected together by a membrane that lines the whole inside.\r\nOne of these is magnified a little at fig. 2. _a_, in order to express\r\nthe figure and situation of each shell the better.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 3. is taken from D’Argentville’s _Lithologie, Pl. 30. fig._\r\nH, who says it is found in the British channel sticking to sea\r\nplants; and that these shells consist of five pieces. This, from its\r\nappearance, I have called the British Channel Penknife, to distinguish\r\nit from the other.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 4. is a species of Barnacle called Poussepieds by the French,\r\nand described by Rondeletius as commonly found adhering to rocks on\r\nthe coast of Brittany. He says the people there boil and eat the stem,\r\nwhich is first of a mouse-colour, and afterwards becomes red like our\r\nprawns. There are many heads, that arise out of one stem, each of which\r\nconsists of two shells, in which are the same parts of the animal as in\r\nthe other species. This I have called the Cornucopia Barnacle. Some of\r\nthe shells of this Barnacle were drawn from a specimen in the British\r\nMuseum. This Lepas is the Mitella of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 5. and 6. are the Barnacles called Conchæ Anatiferæ: these are\r\nthe sorts so well known to sailors, and formerly supposed to produce a\r\nlarge species of duck called a Barnacle. These consist of five shells.\r\nThe tube, that supports one of these kinds, branches out like some\r\nspecies of corallines, bearing a shelled animal at the end of each\r\nbranch. They are generally found adhering to pieces of wood in the sea,\r\nand most ships have some of them sticking to their bottoms. Those of\r\nthe southern and warmer climates are generally of a larger kind than\r\nthose of the colder and more northern climates.\r\n\r\nThe next division of these animals is, those that adhere by the base of\r\ntheir shells, having no stems.\r\n\r\nHere I must observe, that the bottoms of the several species of this\r\ndivision conform in shape to the substances they adhere to, or grasp\r\nthem in such a peculiar manner, as to render their situation secure\r\nfrom the violence of the element they live in. Another provision of\r\nnature for the security of these animals are the four opercula, which,\r\nupon their retreating into the great shell, they can draw to so close\r\nafter them, as to secure themselves from outward danger.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 7. represents the Whale Barnacle, called Pediculus Ceti, just\r\nas it was cut off the whale’s lip, with the seven naked Barnacles with\r\nears, already described. _Fig._ 7.a is the bottom of the shell. This\r\nhas the appearance of the gills of a mushroom. All the spaces between\r\nthese laminæ were filled with the blubber of the whale: by this means\r\nthey adhere to the gristly skin of the fish. The narrow cavities\r\nbetween the branched laminæ are the places where the ligaments or\r\ntendons, that move the opercula, are inserted.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 8. is the Cup Barnacle, taken off an East India ship from\r\nSumatra. The testaceous flat bottom of this was marked with the seams\r\nand lines of the sheathing, and with the rust of the nails. In one of\r\nthese shells the animal is represented protruding his claws thro’ the\r\nopercula.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 9. is called the Bell-shaped Barnacle. This was taken off the\r\nbottom of a ship from Jamaica, and had its flat testaceous base marked\r\nas the former.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 10. This represents part of a most elegant specimen in the\r\ncurious collection of Dr. John Fothergill. It is called the Tulip\r\nBarnacle, and very properly, as well from the shape of its shell, as\r\nthe beautiful stripes of red mixt with white. It adheres to a piece\r\nof the true red coral, and was fished up near Leghorn, on the coast\r\nof Italy. It is not improbable, but that these groups of Barnacles,\r\ngrowing at the same time with the animals that formed the red coral,\r\nmay have received an addition to their fine red colour from the coral.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 11. is a group of Barnacles of a conical form, composed of\r\npurplish tubes like small quills. _Fig._ 11.a represents one of the\r\nsame, with a view of its base, from the collection of Mr. Peter\r\nCollinson, F.R.S. This was brought from the East Indies. The insides of\r\nthese shells have the appearance of the spongy parts of bones.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 12. is called the Tortoise-wart Barnacle, being often found upon\r\nthat animal. This shell is of a plano-convex shape, and looks like\r\npolished ivory. The divisions between the valves represent a star with\r\nsix points. If these shells are put into soap lees, they will in a few\r\nhours separate into six pieces or valves, each shelly valve having\r\ntwo ears, like the scallop-shell: so that this species has its valves\r\nconnected by membranes, instead of testaceous sutures, as most of the\r\nothers have. _Fig. 12. a_ represents the under part of the same shell.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 13. This shell is marked with six rays like a star, as the\r\nformer; but is much deeper in proportion to its diameter. Several\r\nof this kind were found sticking to a crab, that was lately brought\r\nfrom the island of Nevis; from whence I have called it the American\r\nCrabs-wart.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 14. is called the Side-mouth Barnacle. This was found on\r\nthe southern coast of Africa, near the Cape of Good Hope, where it\r\nadheres to a particular species of striated purple muscle. _Fig._ 14.a\r\nrepresents two of the opercula of this Barnacle remarkably horned. The\r\nshell of this is very thin; but its obliquity may probably be owing to\r\nits situation.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 15. This egg-shaped Barnacle with a small mouth is found in\r\nclusters sticking to the Buccinum tribe of shells in the West Indies.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 16. is the Cornish Barnacle, shaped like a cone, and with a\r\nsmall mouth. This is described and figured by the Revᵈ. Mr. William\r\nBorlase, F.R.S. in his Natural History of Cornwall, lately published.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 17. This is the common English Barnacle, that is found in such\r\nplenty upon all rocks and shells round this island. From the animal of\r\nthis, examined in the microscope, I have taken the character of the\r\nfish of the Barnacle genus.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 18. This I have called the Limpet-shaped Barnacle, from its\r\nlikeness to some species of that shell. I am indebted to our late\r\nworthy member, Mr. Arthur Pond, for this shell, who assured me it\r\nwas brought to him from Greenland. It was, with several more, found\r\nsticking to a very large species of muscle.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 19.a. This Sea-Fan, with the Barnacles inclosed in it, was\r\nbrought from Gibraltar. I have called it the Slipper Barnacle, from its\r\nshape. _See Fig._ 19. These shell-fish adhere, while they are young, to\r\nthe slender branches, which are produced by the animals that compose\r\nthis species of Sea-fan; and as the next succession of young animals of\r\nthis sea-fan creep up its sides, to increase the bulk and extension of\r\nthese first-formed ramifications, they inclose the shells all round,\r\nleaving only their mouths or apertures open, for the Barnacles to\r\nprocure their food. But it frequently happens, that the animals of the\r\nSea-fans destroy these Barnacles, by overrunning and involving them in\r\nthe very center of their stems. These small Barnacles, interspersed\r\nhere and there on the branches, have been taken for fruit or berries\r\nby some gentlemen, who look upon the internal or horny part of the\r\nSea-fans to be vegetables.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 20. is a very curious Barnacle, taken from an elegant specimen\r\nin the British Museum; which, from its figure, I have called the\r\nPersian Crown.\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall now add some further observations on the nature of these\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nUpon opening the shells of many of the common English Barnacles (_Fig._\r\n1.) while they were alive, I found the lower part of the shell, which\r\ncontained a cavity equal to two thirds of the whole, full of spawn;\r\nso that the Barnacles, which adhere by the base of their shells, as\r\nwell as those that are supported by fleshy tubes, are propagated by\r\neggs, which they send forth in inconceivable numbers; as appears by the\r\nclusters of young shells, which we find adhering not only to the parent\r\nanimals, but to all hard substances near them.\r\n\r\nThe bottom shell of these animals, as well as their upper shells, vary\r\nin form according to their situation, which occasions some difficulty\r\nin determining their several species with exactness. The form of the\r\nbase shell of our common English Barnacle, is the flat radiated figure\r\nrepresented adhering to a scallop shell in the front of a group of them\r\nat _Fig._ 17. The Barnacles at _Fig._ 8. 9. 14. 15. and 20. have the\r\nsame kind of base.\r\n\r\nI have very lately observed a singular kind of flat Balanus, on a white\r\nMandrepora coral from the coast of Italy, in the possession of Mr.\r\nMendez D’Acosta, F.R.S. whose base appears sunk into the coral, and of\r\nthe form of an inverted cone, bending a little to one side. The inward\r\nsurface of this conical base shell appears curiously striated with\r\ntubular radii, which terminate on the surface of the coral, to receive\r\nthe extremities of the six valves, that compose the upper shell. This\r\npeculiar form of the base seems owing to the animals of the coral and\r\nof the Barnacle growing up together, the latter keeping possession of\r\nits proper space, while the former grew close about it.\r\n\r\nThe bottom shell of the Barnacle like a Limpet, at _Fig._ 18.\r\nincreases from a small point by many thin shelly margins, which\r\nexactly correspond to the indentations which we observe on the base\r\nof the outward shell; so that it appears not unlike the drawing of a\r\nfortification in miniature.\r\n\r\nI am,\r\n\r\n                               Dear Sir,\r\n                    Your most affectionate Friend,\r\n                              John Ellis.\r\n\r\n  _P. S._ The Rev. Mr. William Borlase is now of opinion, that the\r\n  Cornish Barnacle at _Fig._ 16. which he has described in his History\r\n  of Cornwall, is rather a Limpet or Patella.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXIV. _A further Account of the poisonous Effects of the_ Oenanthe\r\nAquatica Succo viroso crocante _of_ Lobel, _or_ Hemlock Dropwort, _by_\r\nW. Watson, _M.D. F.R.S._\r\n\r\n_To the_ ROYAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n[Read Dec. 21, 1758.]\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nIN the month of June 1746. I communicated to you some observations\r\nconcerning the _Oenanthe aquatica Succo viroso crocante_ of Lobel,\r\nin relation to its poisonous effects upon some French prisoners\r\nat Pembroke. These observations were afterwards published in the\r\n_Philosophical Transactions_[225], with an accurate representation of\r\nthe plant itself, from an original drawing by that compleat artist Mr.\r\nEhret. This at that time I thought the more necessary, as it was of no\r\nsmall importance to the public, to be well acquainted with a plant,\r\nthe effects of which, when taken into our bodies, were so much to be\r\ndreaded. This account of mine, as well as the representation of the\r\nplant, were republished from the Transactions into the periodical works\r\nof that time; from whence a more extensive knowlege of and acquaintance\r\nwith this plant might have been hoped for. A late instance however has\r\nevinced, that these endeavours have not had their full effect, as the\r\nplant in question is not yet sufficiently known, and attended to.\r\n\r\nJohn Midlane, a cabinet-maker of Havant in Hampshire, aged about 58,\r\nand of a gross habit of body, was advised to make use of the water\r\nparsnep, as a remedy for a severe scorbutic disorder, which he had long\r\nbeen troubled with; and for which he had taken a variety of medicines.\r\nInstead of the water parsnep, which he purposed to take, there were\r\ngathered for him some roots of the _oenanthe_ above mentioned; a large\r\none of which was pounded in a mortar, and the juice thereof squeezed\r\nthrough a linen cloth, and amounted to about five spoonfuls. This was\r\nsuffered to stand all night, and the next morning (Mar. 31. 1758.), at\r\nabout half an hour past five, he drank the whole quantity, except the\r\nsediment.\r\n\r\nIn about an hour and half after he had taken this juice, he walked\r\nabout the town upon some business; and a little before seven, upon\r\nhis return home, about an hundred yards from his own house, he first\r\ncomplained that he was ill; and having walked about thirty yards\r\nfurther, was so bad as to go into a neighbour’s house to rest himself.\r\nHe was soon led from thence to his own house by two men, and told them,\r\nthat he was affected as though he had lost the use of his limbs. When\r\nhe was placed in his chair, he complained greatly of pain all over\r\nhim; but particularly in his head. His stomach was immediately after\r\naffected, and he had great reachings to vomit. At the second attempt he\r\nthrew up about half a pint of a clear watry liquor; at the first and\r\nthird attempt he discharged scarce any thing. He was then seized with a\r\ngreat propensity to go to stool, which went off in about three minutes.\r\nAfter this, he with the greatest difficulty was conducted upstairs\r\nto bed, where he pulled off part of his cloaths himself. When he was\r\nput to bed, he was attacked with very severe convulsions, which in\r\nabout a quarter of an hour deprived him of his senses; and continued,\r\nwith a few intermissions, till he died, a little before nine o’clock;\r\nwhich was about three hours and half after the juice had been taken.\r\nA profuse sweat accompanied the whole of these symptoms: he foamed\r\nconsiderably at the mouth, and his belly swelled greatly. He purged\r\nvery much soon after he was dead, but not before.\r\n\r\nAs this poor man had taken this dose before his family were up, no\r\none could imagine from whence his disorder arose; and consequently\r\nthe apothecary, who was called to him, was able to form a judgment\r\nof his case only from the symptoms; as on his coming he found his\r\npatient senseless, and who had not, while his mind was undisturbed,\r\ntold any one the probable cause of his complaints. He took from him\r\nhowever about ten ounces of blood, and endeavoured to get some _vinum\r\nipecacuanhæ_ into his mouth: but his jaws were closed so fast, not\r\nabove a spoonful passed, and that by the accident of his mouth opening\r\nof itself.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms, with which the person above-mentioned was attacked, were\r\nmuch the same as those which were observed in the French prisoners, who\r\nwere poisoned by the same root at Pembroke. In both instances occurred\r\nthose severe muscular spasms, which kept the under jaw so close to the\r\nupper, that, while the spasm continued, scarce any force could separate\r\nthem. In both instances likewise a considerable time passed before\r\nthe persons, who had eaten of this root, though they had taken enough\r\nof it to destroy them, perceived themselves disordered by it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Philos.

Trans. Vol. L._ TAB. XXXVI. _p. 860_.\r\n\r\n_J. Mynde. sc._]\r\n\r\nLinnæus, in his _Species Plantarum_, places them under the title\r\n_Enneandria Monogynia_, by the name Laurus.\r\n\r\nThe leaf, flower, and fruit, of this plant, are particularly described\r\nby Mr. Ray.\r\n\r\nThe leaf is smooth and shining; has one large vein running thro’ the\r\nmidst, and a remarkable one on each side; the middle one generally\r\nrunning near the length of the leaf.\r\n\r\nThe leaves differ in shape, some being more acute, others more oval or\r\nobtuse.\r\n\r\nThe flowers grow in an umbel, somewhat like the Laurus Tinus; but they\r\nare small, consisting of one petal, of a tubular form at the bottom,\r\nand divided at the top into six segments in the form of a star.\r\n\r\nThe flowers are succeeded by berries growing out of a capsula, like\r\nacorns in shape; which berries contain a shining seed.\r\n\r\nThe description of Mr. Ray of the flower, in his description of the\r\nCinnamon of Malabar, is extremely accurate; as is also the figure in\r\nthe _Hortus Malabaricus_, Nº. 54. and the description, fol. 107. under\r\nthe name Carua. I shall therefore refer to those.\r\n\r\nI shall not trouble you with the question debated by Mr. Ray, whether\r\nthe Cinnamon and Cassia of the ancients were, or were not, the same\r\nwith those so called by the moderns? whether the Cinnamon of the\r\nancients was the twigs of the tree bearing cloves, or any plant now\r\nunknown to us? Mr. Ray has largely treated on this subject; and to him\r\nI refer such as are curious to be informed on this subject.\r\n\r\nBut as the Cinnamon and Cassia of the ancients are said to have been\r\nused as perfumes, and to make perfumed ointments, I think they must\r\nhave differed from ours, whose smell is not very fragrant, nor is\r\nemitted to any great distance.\r\n\r\nThe matter of the present inquiry is, whether the Cinnamon of Ceylon\r\nis the same sort of plant with that growing in Malabar, Sumatra, _&c._\r\ndiffering only by the soil or climate, in which it grows, which is the\r\nopinion of Garcias; or from the culture or manner of curing the plant,\r\nas I am inclined to believe; or whether it is really a different genus\r\nor species of plant, as many people believe, and some botanical writers\r\nseem to indicate.\r\n\r\nI shall endeavour to explain this matter by producing, 1st, The\r\ndescriptions of the most celebrated authors:\r\n\r\n2dly, By producing the most accurate figures of the plants of Sumatra\r\nand Ceylon: [_See Tab._ xxxvi.]\r\n\r\n3dly, By shewing the specimen of the leaves and branches brought from\r\nSumatra.\r\n\r\nI have no specimen from Ceylon; but have carefully examined the\r\nspecimens kept in the British Museum, with the assistance of Dr. Maty\r\nand Mr. Empson, and compared them with the specimens I have from\r\nSumatra; from whence I traced exactly the figures brought herewith:\r\nwhich specimens are undoubtedly brought from Ceylon, and were the\r\ncollections of Boerhaave, Courteen, Plukenet, and Petiver.\r\n\r\nBut, previous to this inquiry, I would premise, that the writers, who\r\ngive the description of the Cinnamon of Ceylon, were probably not\r\nacquainted with that of Malabar at the time of their publishing their\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nMr. Ray also, who so accurately describes the flower of the Cinnamon\r\nof Malabar, seems not so well acquainted with its fruit; and probably\r\nhad then never seen the specimens of the Cinnamon from Ceylon; for his\r\ndescription is plainly borrowed from others, and not his own. Tho’ I\r\nhave reason to think he afterwards saw the specimens of Mr. Courteen,\r\nand was convinced, that the plants were the same.\r\n\r\nIn his description of the Cinnamon of Ceylon, he supposes differences\r\nin the manner of veining the leaf, which are not found in the leaves\r\nthemselves. He supposes, that the Cinnamon of Ceylon differs from\r\nthat of Malabar by its berries growing in cups like acorns; which\r\nis apparently the same in both, as may be seen in its figure in the\r\n_Hortus Malabaricus_.\r\n\r\nThe other differences taken notice of by the botanic writers are as\r\nfollow:\r\n\r\nIn the _Flora Zeylanica_, p. 545. and in the _Materia Medica_, 190. the\r\nCinnamon of Ceylon is called _Laurus foliis trinerviis ovato-oblongis\r\nnervis unientibus_: which description is adhered to in the _Hortus\r\nCliffordiensis_, p. 154. under the name _Laurus foliis oblongo-ovatis\r\nnitidis planis_. And Burman, in his _Flora Zeylanica_, 62. T. 27. calls\r\nit _Cinamomum foliis latis ovatis_. Whereas the Cassia of Sumatra is\r\ndistinguished by these writers: that in _Flora Zeyl._ 146. and in\r\n_Materia Medica_, 191. is called _Laurus foliis trinerviis lanceolatis\r\nnervis supra basin unitis_: and Burman, _Zeylan._ 63. T. 28. calls it\r\n_Cinamomum perpetuo florens folio tenuiore acuto_.\r\n\r\nThe distinction therefore, which these writers would make us believe\r\nthere is between these plants, consists in the leaves of the one being\r\noval, the other sharp-pointed; and that the nerves are limited at the\r\nbottom in the Cinnamon, but not so in the Cassia: for as to the _semper\r\nflorens_, mentioned by Burman, that must undoubtedly be common to both.\r\n\r\nNow as to the different shape of the leaves, we know how often this\r\nhappens by seminal varieties, and from the age of plants, as in the\r\nleaves of holly and ivy; and that even the shapes of leaves vary\r\ngreatly on the very same plant, and sometimes on the same branch; as in\r\nthe ash, and many other plants, the leaves of the young shoots are more\r\noval than those on the old boughs, which are generally more pointed.\r\nBut this variety is much more frequent in the plants of warm countries.\r\nIn the sassafras, part of the leaves generally near the bottom of the\r\nplant are plain, whilst the other leaves are divided into three lobes\r\nor segments. I have observed great difference also in the leaves of\r\nalmost every one of the American oaks.\r\n\r\nIn the Virginian cedar, the berries of the same plant produce some\r\nplants with juniper leaves, and others with leaves like the savin; and\r\nsome plants with both leaves growing on the same plant.\r\n\r\nI must observe that Burman has, in his figures of the two plants before\r\nmentioned, made them extremely different. In that of Ceylon he has made\r\nall the leaves oval; and, to make the difference greater, has drawn the\r\nrudiments of the berries; to which he has added the flower, or part of\r\nit, at the top of the style or rudiment of the fruit: and in that of\r\nMalabar he has drawn the flower growing in the umbel.\r\n\r\nOn these drawings I must observe, that his drawing of the Cinnamon of\r\nCeylon agrees with no one specimen in the British Museum; and scarcely\r\nis one leaf to be found of the shape, which he gives.\r\n\r\nThe first figure, which I shall produce, is a drawing which I procured\r\nfrom the ingenious Mr. Ehret in the year 1754: which, as I am informed\r\nby Mr. Empson, was from a specimen, given to Mr. Ehret by him in that\r\nyear, of the Cinnamon of Ceylon. _See Fig._ 1.\r\n\r\nThis agrees in every thing with the drawing of the Cinnamon of Malabar\r\nin the _Hort. Malab._ fig. 54. fol. 107. and there called Carua; except\r\nthat it wants the fruit: but that defect is supplied by Mr. Ray’s\r\ndescription of the Cinnamon of Ceylon above mentioned. _See fig. of the\r\nfruit, Fig._ 2.\r\n\r\nIn the figure in the _Hort. Malabar._ it may be observed, that the\r\nnerves do not go quite to the bottom of the leaf. But this is merely\r\naccidental, as will appear by the leaves of the same plant brought from\r\nSumatra, which I shall produce; in which, part of the leaves have veins\r\ngoing quite to the bottom, and united there, and the others not so.\r\n_See Fig._ 3.\r\n\r\nThe next drawing I shall produce contains that of the leaves of the\r\nCinnamon plant, from specimens in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n    _Fig._ 4. A specimen, with the flower, from the collection of\r\n      Mr. Courteen, who lived long in Ceylon. These leaves were more\r\n      pointed, but were broke at the end.\r\n\r\n    _Fig._ 5. A whole leaf, with its point, in the same collection,\r\n      growing on a branch, on which are the rudiments of the fruit.\r\n\r\n    _Fig._ 6. A leaf in Plukenet’s specimens.\r\n\r\n    _Fig._ 7. Another leaf of the same collection, and of the same\r\n      plant.\r\n\r\n    _Fig._ 8. A leaf of a large specimen from Boerhaave’s collection.\r\n\r\n    _Fig._ 9. Another leaf on the same branch.\r\n\r\n    _Fig._ 10. A specimen from Petiver’s collection. The points of the\r\n      leaves are broken off.\r\n\r\n    _Fig._ 11. The flower of the first specimen.\r\n\r\n    _Fig._ 12. In the rudiment of the seed before formed, in the state\r\n      given in Burman’s first drawing.\r\n\r\n    _Note_, It is to be observed also, that the specimens of the\r\n      Cinnamon of Ceylon are probably of cultivated plants.\r\n\r\nFrom all these specimens it plainly appears, that the distinction of\r\n_foliis ovatis & lanceolatis_ does not appear well founded.\r\n\r\nBut were it otherwise, and that the leaves of the plants differed, it\r\nwould by no means be a proof of any material difference in the nature\r\nor quality of the plants; as is well known to persons conversant in\r\nnatural history.\r\n\r\nBefore I leave this subject of the description of the plant, it may\r\nbe proper to mention, that Bauhin calls the one of these plants\r\n_Cinnamomum_ or _Canella Malabarica & Javanensis_, and the other\r\n_Cinnamomum Canella Zeylanica_, Bauhin. _pinax_ 408 and 409; but\r\nneither from these names, nor from his description, can any conclusive\r\nargument be formed: and that Herman, in his _Hort. Lugd. Batav._ 129.\r\nt. 1655. calls this Cinnamon of Ceylon _Cassia Cinnamonia_.\r\n\r\nIf any conjecture can arise from hence, it may be, that the Cinnamon of\r\nCeylon was formerly, as well as that of Sumatra and Malabar, called\r\nCassia; but that the Dutch writers, being acquainted with the excellent\r\nqualities, which the ancients ascribed to their Cinnamon, chose to\r\nadd the name Cinnamon to that of Cassia: and in process of time they\r\nhave found the name of Cinnamon more profitable than that of Cassia,\r\nby which we chuse to call our Canella, to our national loss of many\r\nthousands a year.\r\n\r\nHaving now given an account of the figure of these plants, and in what\r\nrespect they are said herein to differ; I shall proceed to consider the\r\npretended differences in the Canella itself; which are supposed not\r\nto be in form only, but substantial and material; and are generally\r\nunderstood to be so by persons supposed to be acquainted with the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nMr. Ray states this matter fully in his _Hist. Plant._ vol. ii. p.\r\n1560. in these words: _Officinæ nostræ Cassiam ligneam a Cinnamomo seu\r\nCanella distinctam faciunt, Cassiam Cinnamomo crassiorem plerumque\r\nesse, colore rubicundiorem, substantiâ duriorem, solidiorem &\r\ncompactiorem, gustu magis glutinoso, odore quidem & sapore Cinnamomum\r\naptius referre, tamen Cinnamomo imbecilliorum & minus vegetam esse, ex\r\naccurata observatione Tho. Johnson._\r\n\r\nFrom these reasons Mr. Ray draws a conclusion (I must own not very\r\ninstructive), that the Cinnamon of Ceylon is Cinnamon; and the Cinnamon\r\nof Malabar, &c. is the Cassia of the shops.\r\n\r\nFrom the specimens I shall now produce, it will most plainly appear,\r\nthat these differences are merely accidents arising from the age of the\r\nCanella, the part of the tree from whence it is gathered, and from the\r\nmanner of cultivating and curing it.\r\n\r\nIn the _Philosoph. Transact._ Nº. 278. p. 1099. in Mr. Strachan’s\r\naccount of Ceylon, which is abridged by Eames and Martyn, vol. ii. p.\r\n183. he says, that there are two sorts of Cinnamon-trees, of which the\r\ntree, which is esteemed the best, has a leaf much larger and thicker\r\nthan the other; but otherwise no difference is to be perceived.\r\n\r\n   _Note_, Here is no mention of the _folio ovato_.\r\n\r\nI remember, in an account given some years ago to the Royal Society,\r\nthree or four sorts were mentioned; and it was said the best sort was\r\ncut every three or four years.\r\n\r\nThis superiority I then guessed (as well as the difference of leaves\r\nmentioned by Mr. Strachan) to arise from the cutting the tree down\r\nevery three or four years; which occasioned it to produce strong and\r\nvigorous shoots, thicker and larger leaves, as well as greater quantity\r\nof bark, and of a superior quality.\r\n\r\nA large shoot or sucker of this plant was produced in the year 1750. or\r\n51. by my worthy friend Dr. William Watson, together with an account\r\nof the Cinnamon-tree; which is published in the _Philosoph. Transact._\r\nvol. xlvii. p. 301. This shoot was a plain proof to me, that the\r\nCinnamon was frequently cut down, and that this shoot arose from the\r\nroot of a plant so cut; for it was of the size of a walking-cane; and\r\nno shrub could have produced such a shoot, unless a strong plant cut\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nThis method of treating this plant accounts for the mistake of Garcias,\r\nmentioned by Mr. Ray; _viz. Quæ Garcias habet de duplice hujus arboris\r\ncortice ad modum suberis, nobis suspecta sunt, quæque de deliberatione\r\nsemel triennio facta; non enim puto renascitur cortex semel detractus._\r\n\r\nThis shews, that the bark was gathered every three years: but Mr. Ray\r\nwas not acquainted, that the plant was cut down, in order to take off\r\nthe bark, once in three years.\r\n\r\nIn the account above mentioned to be given to the Society by Dr.\r\nWatson, no descriptions are given either of the plants of Ceylon, or\r\nMalabar; but he quotes Burman, who says, that he had nine different\r\nsorts of Cinnamon from Ceylon, of which that, which is the best, is\r\nbrought to us, and called by the name _Rasse Coronde_.\r\n\r\nWhat the differences between these sorts were, does not appear; whether\r\nin leaf or bark, or manner of culture. And I must observe, that in\r\nall the specimens in the British Museum I could observe no difference\r\nof species. But this is to be understood, that every sort coming from\r\nCeylon is, by the Dutch and by the shops, called Cinnamon; and that of\r\nour own growth is by them always called Cassia. The reason is obvious.\r\n\r\nThe specimens, which I now produce, of the Canella or bark of the\r\nCinnamon of Sumatra, I procured in the year 1755. from Mr. Tho. Combes,\r\na gentleman then in the service of the East India Company in Sumatra,\r\nby means of a friend.\r\n\r\nI was then attempting to form a society for the carrying on a General\r\nNatural History, to try proper experiments, and to employ proper\r\npainters and engravers suitable to the importance of the subject; and\r\ntherefore attempted to establish a correspondence in those parts, whose\r\nproductions are as yet little known to the public.\r\n\r\nI mention this design, because it would not be possible else to explain\r\nwhat Mr. Combes means by the word _Society_, which he so often mentions\r\nin his letter; of which I shall produce an extract, so far as it\r\nrelates to the present inquiry.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me very improbable (as the same plants are generally found\r\nin the same latitude and soil), that the spices now in the possession\r\nof the Dutch should grow only in that small tract of land, which is in\r\ntheir possession. And I had many credible informations, that, whatever\r\nthey may pretend to the contrary, this is only a pretence.\r\n\r\nI therefore desired to obtain the best information of the nature and\r\nculture of the plants producing spices, as well as of many other\r\nthings, which are foreign from this inquiry.\r\n\r\nI desired to know, how the spices were dried and cured; and that\r\ndifferent specimens might be sent me of the plants, their seed, flower,\r\nleaf, and bark, and properly cured and prepared.\r\n\r\nThis produced the answer I lay before you herewith, together with the\r\nspecimens now produced.\r\n\r\nYou see hereby, that the Dutch dry their Cinnamon in sand; probably to\r\ntake away that viscosity, which is complained of in the Cassia.\r\n\r\nAnd you will observe also, that the specimen produced dried and cured\r\nis also as free from any viscosity, as the Cinnamon of Ceylon: That it\r\nagrees also with the Cinnamon in every other quality, and in colour;\r\nand that none of the distinctions mentioned by Mr. Ray can be found\r\nherein; but that they may arise from the part of the tree, from whence\r\nthe bark was taken; the inner bark of the large wood being red, as you\r\nsee by the other specimen produced. And the common Cassia taken from\r\nthe larger branches, and not cured, has the viscosity complained of\r\nin some degree, tho’ much less than it had four years since, when I\r\nreceived it.\r\n\r\nMr. Ray says, that one is weaker in taste, as he supposes, than the\r\nother. That may be so from its manner of drying, or keeping of it.\r\nDried in large quantities, and by a stronger heat, it will probably be\r\nstronger, than if it is dried in a lesser quantity, and slower.\r\n\r\nAs for the viscosity, the glutinous part is found in every plant in\r\nsome degree, as well as in every animal. It preserves the parts from\r\nmoisture; but will be consumed by heat or time; and it will be a\r\npreservative to the plant, till it is destroyed; which was the reason,\r\nas I suppose, that Mr. Ray mentions Cassia to have kept good thirty\r\nyears, the viscosity not having been destroyed by drying.\r\n\r\nI suppose the reason, which the Dutch have to dry it, is to make it\r\nsooner fit for the market, and possibly fitter for distillation.\r\n\r\nYou will see from Mr. Combes’s letters and specimens, that he thinks\r\nthere may be two sorts of Cassia or Cinnamon in Sumatra: possibly there\r\nmay be the same difference in Ceylon; but, if so, I suspect them both\r\nto be only seminal varieties, and that their virtues are the same.\r\n\r\nMr. Barlow, some time since a Surgeon in the service of the India\r\ncompany, made a considerable quantity of oil of the Cassia of Sumatra,\r\nwhich was very little, if any thing, inferior to that drawn from\r\nCinnamon; and it was sold to great profit.\r\n\r\nIf these plants are really the same, or if they are of equal goodness,\r\nsupposing there was a small difference in the form of the leaf, it\r\nmight be well worth the attention of the East India company to try to\r\ncultivate these plants in the manner they do in Ceylon; that is, to\r\nmake plantations in a proper soil; and to have regard to the proper\r\ndistance from the sea of the place, where they try the experiment: for\r\nsome plants require to be near the sea, and others far from it, in\r\nSumatra; which is the case of the Mango, and Mangosteen; the one of\r\nwhich must be near the sea, the other at a distance from it.\r\n\r\nI think the plants should be suffered to grow strong, to be six or\r\nseven years old, and then cut every three years, the bark peel’d off\r\nand dried in hot sand, and packed close and kept dry. This I take to be\r\nall necessary to be done, to try, if our Cinnamon will not produce as\r\ngood a price as that of the Dutch.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the plants need not stand so long before cut; for the\r\nvegetation of plants in hot countries is very great.\r\n\r\nThere are many other most valuable vegetables in Sumatra, which might\r\nbe made staple commodities, as sagoe, camphire, several sorts of\r\nginger, rice, and many other, which are foreign to the present inquiry.\r\n\r\nBut it may not be amiss to recommend it to the traders to Sumatra to\r\nbring some quantity of the twig-bark of the true Cassia, well cured;\r\nand also to the company, to have a chemist at Sumatra, to extract\r\ncarefully the oil of Cassia; which is best, and in greatest quantities,\r\nproduced from the bark of the body, and of the larger branches of\r\nthe tree: and also that the company would procure an exemption of\r\nall customs or duties on Cassia, or on the oil of Cassia, for some\r\ntime: and also that the college of physicians in their dispensatory\r\nwould direct Cassia or Cinnamon of Malabar or Sumatra to be used,\r\ninstead of the Cinnamon of Ceylon; and that the same should be used by\r\napothecaries and distillers, and in all simple and compound waters, in\r\nwhich Cinnamon is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extract of a Letter from Mr._ THOMAS COMBES, _dated_ Fort Marlborough,\r\n5 Jan. 1755.\r\n\r\nIN regard to the first article of your paper, now before me, which is\r\nthe inquiry desired to be made concerning the spices, I am of opinion,\r\nthat the true Cinnamon grows no-where but on the island of Ceylon,\r\nunless Cassia be allowed to be the same tree, which I am inclined to\r\nthink.\r\n\r\nNº. 9. contains seeds of the Cassia or wild Cinnamon-tree. As for the\r\nseeds of the true Cinnamon-tree, I believe they are very difficult to\r\nbe got; for as the Dutch are the sole masters of this spice, and get\r\na good deal of money by it, I fancy, according to their usual custom,\r\nthey have very well guarded against the transplantation of it. I hope\r\nhowever, that these seeds will not be unacceptable to the society, as\r\nCassia itself is of some value; and as I am very doubtful, whether this\r\ntree is not the same with the true Cinnamon, being of opinion, that the\r\ndifference observed in them arises from the different method of curing\r\ntheir barks, or from the taking the bark from different parts of the\r\ntree, or at different seasons, or of different ages, or perhaps all\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nI have made inquiry concerning this from some very intelligent persons,\r\nand found them to be of opinion, that the Cassia and Cinnamon-tree\r\nwere of the same genus. I have inquired further concerning the method\r\nof curing it at Ceylon; but as this is done by the natives, the Dutch\r\nare not very well acquainted with it; nor could I obtain any good\r\naccount of it, different people giving me different relations. Some\r\nsaid, it was the inner bark, some the middle, and some the outer; tho’\r\nof the young branches, they seemed in general to agree, that it was\r\ngathered at a certain season of the year, and that one part of the cure\r\nwas burying it in sand for some time. This may be tried with Cassia,\r\nand may perhaps take away that viscosity or glutinous quality observed\r\nby chewing it, and which is the principal mark for distinguishing it\r\nfrom Cinnamon. As to their chemical oils, I have heard many people say,\r\nthat they are not distinguishable otherwise, than that from Cinnamon\r\nis generally better, or, as it may be called, stronger, than that from\r\nCassia; and accordingly bears a better price. But the Dutch company’s\r\nchemist at Batavia, if I may give him this title, informed me, that\r\nthey are essentially different, and plainly distinguishable. But I\r\nmust confess myself very doubtful of the knowlege or veracity of this\r\nchemist, and strongly suspect, that they are no otherwise different\r\nthan in goodness, as many other oils drawn from the same subject are.\r\n\r\nI observe the price of Cassia is greatly risen in England within these\r\ntwo or three years; but whether this be owing to an increase in the\r\nconsumption, or a decrease in the importation of this commodity, I\r\ncannot say.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch government of Batavia has this year, in some new regulations\r\nof their trade, prohibited to all persons the dealing in any of the\r\nfine quilled sort of Cassia, and declared the same to be contraband,\r\nand reserved for their company only; and put it upon the same footing\r\nas their Cinnamon.\r\n\r\nWhat reasons induced them to this, I am yet a stranger to; but it makes\r\nme suspect, that the rise of this commodity in Europe is owing to some\r\nother cause than a deficiency in the importation thereof. Perhaps some\r\ndiscovery has been made rendering Cassia equal to Cinnamon.\r\n\r\nIn Persia, I think, they make not so great a difference between them\r\nas elsewhere; and I myself, for want of Cinnamon here for some months\r\npast, made use of the fine quilled Cassia; and the difference I observe\r\nbetween them I imagine to arise rather from the greenness and want of\r\ndryness in the Cassia, than any thing else, or perhaps from the method\r\nof curing it: for if there happens to be a little too much Cassia put\r\ninto my chocolate (and other things I use in it), a little bitterish\r\ntaste arises, something like what we meet with in most barks; tho’ I do\r\nnot remember to have observed this of Cinnamon: but as to its boiling\r\nto a jelly, as Quincy mentions, I find no such thing, and think it\r\nbears boiling as well as Cinnamon. Nor do I think its distilled water\r\nmore subject to an empyreuma than that of Cinnamon.\r\n\r\nI have inquired of the country people here, who bring it us, and they\r\ntell me the finest sort is the inner bark of the small branches; and\r\nindeed that it is the inner bark, I think, is evident in Cinnamon as\r\nwell as Cassia; no outer bark of the youngest branches of any tree\r\nhaving, in my opinion, that smooth surface observable in both these\r\nbarks.\r\n\r\nI once thought, that it was better to take the bark from the body of\r\nthe tree than from the branches, imagining that the bark from the trunk\r\nor body of all trees must in general be stronger, let its natural\r\ntaste be what it will, than from its branches. This I find to be so\r\nin Cassia; and I have been informed, that the large ligneous pieces\r\nof Cassia have afforded rather more oil in distillation than the fine\r\nquilled sort, their weight being equal; but upon trial I could not make\r\nthe bark from the trunk curl or roll up, as it ought to do, owing, as I\r\nsuppose, to my unskilfulness, or to rigidity, or the natural position\r\nof its fibres; for the bark of the younger branches curled of itself,\r\nwanting hardly any other assistance than the sun.\r\n\r\nI have already observed, that Cassia is found in chewing to have a\r\nviscidness, which Cinnamon has not. I have endeavoured to remove this\r\nin a little I send you, marked B: pray let me know, if it answers; and\r\nbe assured, it was taken from the younger branches of the tree, of\r\nwhich I send you the seeds.\r\n\r\nI send you also, marked C, some of the bark taken from the same tree;\r\nas also some of the leaves, marked D.\r\n\r\nI have sent you also a little of the bark of the trunk of a tree,\r\nwhich, tho’ called Cassia, seems not to be so, marked E; and also the\r\nleaves of the same tree, marked F.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND _of the_ FIFTIETH VOLUME.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  AN\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n                                TO THE\r\n                            FIFTIETH VOLUME\r\n                                OF THE\r\n                      PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS,\r\n                     For the YEARS 1757 and 1758.\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\n_AIR_, Remarks on the heat of it in July 1757, by Dr. J.

Hist. lib. xxxvi. c. 26. §. 66.\r\n\r\n[40] Pliny mentions a kind of glass or jet called _obsidianum_:\r\n--_nigerrimi coloris, aliquando et translucidi, crassiore visu, atque\r\nin speculis parietum pro imagine umbras reddente_. Nat. Hist. lib.\r\nxxxvi. c. 26. §. 67.\r\n\r\nAnd that the practice of staining glass was known in his time, appears\r\nfrom what he says concerning the _obsidianum_ mentioned above:--_Fit et\r\ngenere tincturæ--totum rubens vitrum, atque non translucidum_.

Plin. tom. II. p. 854.\r\n\r\nI do not find this expresly asserted by Pliny: but it might have been\r\nso in fact. This fashion indeed was not begun till after Agrippa had\r\nbuilt his _thermæ_: but if we suppose that to have been even as late as\r\nhis third consulship, _viz. ante Christ._ 27. (_Helvicus_), when he\r\nerected the Pantheon (or at least its portico), near adjoining to those\r\n_thermæ_, there would have been sufficient room, from that period to\r\nthe birth of Pliny (_viz. anno Christi_ 24), for the introduction of\r\nthis usage.\r\n\r\n[60] Plin.

Eccles._) says,\r\nthat Lactantius--_Extremâ senectute magister Cæsaris Crispi filii\r\nConstantini in Gallia fuit_. He must probably have exercised this\r\ncharge between _anno Christi_ 309, when Constantine began to reign,\r\nand 320. If he was then of a great age, he might have composed the\r\ntreatise, out of which this authority is produced, and which was one\r\nof the earliest of his works, that are extant (_Vid. Sparkii præf. ad\r\nLactant._), 40 years before, _viz._ about _anno Christi_ 280; which\r\nbrings us up to 200 years after the overthrow of Herculaneum, as above.\r\n\r\n[65] Lib. i. c. 20.

From whence, by taking the fluents,\r\n_n_ × Log. (_x_ + √(_xx_ - 1)) (or Log. (_x_ + √(_xx_ - 1))_ⁿ_) = Log.\r\n_X_ + √(_XX_ - 1); and consequently (_x_ + √(_xx_ - 1))_ⁿ_ = _X_ +\r\n√(_XX_ - 1): whence also, seeing _x_ - √(_xx_ - 1) is the reciprocal\r\nof _x_ + √(_xx_ - 1), and _X_ - √(_XX_ - 1) of _X_ + √(_XX_ - 1), it\r\nis likewise evident, that (_x_ - √(_xx_ - 1))_ⁿ_ = _X_ - √(_XX_ - 1).\r\nHence, not only the truth of the above assumption, but what has been\r\nadvanced in relation to the roots of the equation _zⁿ_ - 1 = 0, will\r\nappear manifest. For if _x_ ± √(_xx_ - 1) be put = _z_, then will _zⁿ_\r\n(= (_x_ ± √(_xx_ - 1))_ⁿ_) = _X_ ± √(_XX_ - 1): where, assuming _X_\r\n= 1 = co-s. 0 = co-s. 360° = co-s. 2 × 360° = co-s. 3 × 360°, _&c._\r\nthe equation will become _zⁿ_ = 1, or _zⁿ_ - 1 = 0; and the different\r\nvalues of _x_, in the expression (_x_ ± √(_xx_ - 1)) for the root _z_,\r\nwill consequently be the co-sines of the arcs, 0 ⁄ _n_, 360° ⁄ _n_, (2\r\n× 360°) ⁄ _n_, _&c._ these arcs being the corresponding _submultiples_\r\nof those above, answering to the co-sine _X_ (= 1).----In the same\r\nmanner, if _X_ be taken = -1 = co-s. 180° = co-s. 3 × 180° = co-s. 5 ×\r\n180°, _&c._ then will _zⁿ_ = -1, or _zⁿ_ + 1 = 0; and the values of _x_\r\nwill, in this case, be the co-sines of 180° ⁄ _n_, 3 × (180° ⁄ _n_), 5\r\n× (180° ⁄ _n_), _&c._\r\n\r\n[157] _Avellana purgatrix_; in French, _medicinier_.\r\n\r\n[158] This refers to Mr. Baker’s having supposed, that old iron and old\r\nbrass may be mixt sometimes, and melted down together.\r\n\r\n[159] Vide Wilkins’s real Character, p. 131.

Ce\r\ndernier _m’a fait l’honneur de l’adopter_ dans une savante Dissertation\r\nimprimée a Oxford en 1750, à la suite d’une autre Dissertation sur\r\ndeux inscriptions Phéniciennes.” _Mémoires de Litterature, tirés des\r\nRegistres de l’Académie Royale des Inscriptions & Belles-Lettres, &c._\r\nTom. xxiv. p. 60. A Paris, 1756.\r\n\r\nFor the better understanding of this note, it will be proper to\r\nobserve, that the stranger therein mentioned was M. Brucker, Professor\r\nof History in the University of Basil; with whom I contracted an\r\nacquaintance when at Oxford, towards the close of March 1750. This\r\ngentleman then informed me, that M. l’Abbé Barthelemy communicated\r\nto him draughts of three Samaritan coins of Jonathan, prince and\r\nhigh-priest of the Jews. He added, that one of these exhibited\r\nthe words ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΑΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΟΥ; which, according to him, M. l’Abbé\r\nBarthelemy interpreted of Alexander the Great, taking the piece\r\nto have been twice struck. This M. Brucker afterwards in a great\r\nmeasure confirmed, by a letter he wrote to me at Oxford; which I\r\npublished intire in 1750, and endeavoured to prove, that the foregoing\r\ninscription was to be understood of Alexander I. king of Syria, and not\r\nof Alexander the Great. The Samaritan inscription, which M. Brucker\r\nonly just touched upon, as is manifest from his letter, I likewise\r\nattempted to explain; producing proper vouchers, in support of what I\r\nadvanced. Thus stands the fact, which seems to have given some offence\r\nto M. l’Abbé, stated in the most concise manner possible; and from it,\r\nthus stated, as I apprehend, are naturally deducible the following\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\n1. As I differed in opinion from M. l’Abbé, with regard to the words\r\nΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΑΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΟΥ, as well as in several other respects, and\r\nsupported by indisputable authorities what I in all points advanced,\r\nwithout receiving from any person whatsoever the least information\r\nrelative thereto; it very evidently appears, that I did not _adopt_ M.\r\nl’Abbé’s explication of the coin in question.\r\n\r\n2. By publishing M. Brucker’s letter, which I have still by me,\r\nintire, I both did him justice, and clearly acknowledged M. l’Abbé to\r\nhave first discovered the medals it treats of to belong to Jonathan,\r\nprince and high-priest of the Jews; and therefore have by no means\r\nendeavoured, as he would insinuate, to rob him of the glory of such a\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\n3. As M. l’Abbé in effect owns himself to have seen my dissertation,\r\nand has (if M. Brucker rightly informed me) since the reading of\r\nhis memoir, substituted my notion, relating to the words, ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ\r\nΑΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΟΥ, in the room of his own; some people may perhaps imagine,\r\nthat I have at least as much reason to recriminate on this occasion,\r\nas he had to charge me with the _adoption_ of his explication. Nay,\r\nas he expresly acquaints the public, that M. Brucker imparted to\r\nme the very interpretation of the coin he (M. l’Abbé) had before\r\ncommunicated to him, and as this interpretation most evidently makes\r\nit to have been first struck in the reign of Alexander the Great;\r\nevery unprejudiced person, unacquainted with the elevated genius and\r\nextensive erudition of M. l’Abbé, will be strongly induced to believe,\r\nthat there would be no great injustice in a recrimination. But far\r\nbe it from me to retort the accusation upon M. l’Abbé. His uncommon\r\nlearning, his singular modesty, his strict honour, his utter contempt\r\nof vanity and ostentation in every shape, so conspicuous to all the\r\nworld, must set him infinitely above the reach of such an imputation.\r\nHowever, notwithstanding the superior merit and exalted abilities of\r\nM. l’Abbé, notwithstanding the known aversion of the French writers\r\nto the practice here hinted at, and their most generous and candid\r\ntreatment hitherto of those belonging to the British nation, it will\r\nperhaps hereafter be thought expedient, by the ACADEMY OF INSCRIPTIONS\r\nAND BELLES LETTRES, not frequently to suffer an interval of seven years\r\nto elapse, between the reading and publication of their memoirs. For\r\nby such unaccountable delays, if often repeated, a handle may possibly\r\nbe given to many of the _haughty islanders_ of reflecting upon, or at\r\nleast entertaining unfavourable sentiments of, some of the members of\r\nthat illustrious body.\r\n\r\nSee _De Num. quibusd.
