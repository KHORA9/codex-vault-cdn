NEW YORK, JANUARY 1, 1851.

The exploits of Marlborough are forgotten, as Wellington's will\r\nbe, while the wisdom and genius of Burke live in the memory, and form a\r\nportion of the virtue and intelligence of the British nation and the\r\nBritish race. The reflection of this superior power and permanence of\r\nmoral grandeur over that which, at best, is but a vulgar renown,\r\njustifies the most sanguine expectations of humanity.\r\n\r\nIt may be said of Burke, as it was said by him of another, that \"his\r\nmind was generous, open, sincere; his manners plain, simple, and noble;\r\nrejecting all sorts of duplicity and disguise, as useless to his\r\ndesigns, and odious to his nature. His understanding was comprehensive,\r\nsteady, and vigorous, made for the practical business of the state....\r\nHis knowledge, in all things which concerned his duty was profound....\r\nHe was not more respectable on the public scene, than amiable in private\r\nlife.... A husband and a father, the kindest, gentlest, most indulgent,\r\nhe was every thing in his family, except what he gave up to his\r\ncountry.... An ornament and blessing to the age in which he lived, his\r\nmemory will continue to be beneficial to mankind, by holding forth an\r\nexample of pure and unaffected virtue, most worthy of imitation, to the\r\nlatest posterity.\"\r\n\r\nIn the last of a series of articles by Mrs. S. C. Hall, entitled\r\n\"Pilgrimages to English Shrines,\" and published in the London _Art\r\nJournal_, we have an account of a visit to the residences and to the\r\ngrave of Burke, which we reproduce in the following pages, with its\r\ninteresting illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRAVE OF EDMUND BURKE.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that we are inclined to over-value great men when their\r\ngraves have been long green, or their monuments gray above them, but we\r\nbelieve it is only then we estimate them as they deserve. Prejudice and\r\nfalsehood have no enduring vitality, and posterity is generally anxious\r\nto render justice to the mighty dead; we dwell upon their actions,--we\r\nquote their sentiments and opinions,--we class them amongst our\r\nhousehold gods--and keep their memories green within the sanctuary of\r\nour HOMES; we read to our children and friends the written treasures\r\nbequeathed to us by the genius and independence of the great statesmen\r\nand orators--the men of literature and science--who \"_have been_.\" We\r\nadorn our minds with the poetry of the past, and value it, as well we\r\nmay, as far superior to that of the present: we sometimes, by the aid of\r\nimagination--one of the highest of God's gifts--bring great men before\r\nus: we hear the deep-toned voices and see the flashing eyes of some,\r\nwho, it may be, taught kings their duty, or quelled the tumults of a\r\nfactious people: we listen to the lay of the minstrel, or the orator's\r\naddresses to the assembly, and our pulses throb and our eyes moisten as\r\nthe eloquence flows--first, as a gentle river, until gaining strength in\r\nits progress, it sweeps onwards like a torrent, overcoming all that\r\nsought to impede its progress. What a happy power this is!--what a\r\nglorious triumph over time!--recalling or creating at will!--peopling\r\nour small chamber with the demigods of history; viewing them enshrined\r\nin their perfections, untainted by the world; hearing their exalted\r\nsentiments; knowing them as we know a noble statue or a beautiful\r\npicture, without the taint of age or feebleness, or the mildew of decay.\r\n\r\nIf these sweet wakening dreams were more frequent, we should be happier;\r\nyes, and better than we are; we should be shamed out of much\r\nbaseness--for nothing so purifies and exalts the soul as the actual or\r\nimaginary companionship of the pure and exalted; no man who purposed to\r\ncreate a noble picture would choose an imperfect model; no one who seeks\r\nvirtue and cherishes honor and honorable things, will endure the\r\ndegradation of ignoble persons or ignoble thoughts; no one ever achieved\r\na great purpose who did not plant his standard on high ground.\r\n\r\nA little before the commencement of the present century, England was\r\nrich in orators, and poets, and men of letters; the times were favorable\r\nto such--events called them forth--and there was still a lingering\r\nchivalric feeling in our island which the utilitarian principles or\r\ntastes of the present period would now treat with neglect, if not\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the French Revolution agitated Europe; and men wondered\r\nif the young Corsican would ever dare to wield the sceptre wrenched from\r\nthe grasp of a murdered king; people were continually on the watch for\r\nfresh events; great stakes were played for all over Europe, and those\r\nwho desired change were full of hope. It was an age to create great men.\r\n\r\nLet us then indulge in visions of those, who, in more recent times than\r\nwe have yet touched upon,--save in one or two PILGRIMAGES,--illumed the\r\nlater days of the last century; and, brightest and purest of the galaxy\r\nwas the orator, EDMUND BURKE. Ireland, which gave him birth, may well be\r\nproud of the high-souled and high-gifted man, who united in himself all\r\nthe great qualities which command attention in the senate and the world,\r\nand all the domestic virtues that sanctify home; grasping a knowledge of\r\nall things, and yet having that sweet sympathy with the small things of\r\nlife, which at once bestows and secures happiness, and, in the end,\r\npopularity.\r\n\r\nEDMUND BURKE was born on Arran Quay, Dublin, January the 1st, 1730; his\r\nfather was an attorney: the name, we believe, was originally spelt\r\nBourke.\r\n\r\nThe great grandfather of Edmund inherited some property in that county\r\nwhich has produced so many men of talent--the county of Cork; the family\r\nresided in the neighborhood of Castletown Roche, four or five miles from\r\nDoneraile, five or six miles from Mallow--now a railroad station--and\r\nnearly the same distance from the ruins of Kilcolman Castle, whose every\r\nmouldering stone is hallowed by the memory of the poet Spenser and his\r\ndear friend, \"the Shepherd of the Ocean,\" Sir Walter Raleigh. There can\r\nbe little doubt that Edmund--a portion of whose young life was passed in\r\nthis beautiful locality--imbibed much thought, as well as much poetry,\r\nfrom the sacred memories which here accompanied him during his\r\nwanderings.\r\n\r\nNothing so thoroughly awakens the sympathy of the young as the imaginary\r\npresence of the good and great amid the scenes where their most glorious\r\nworks were accomplished; the associations connected with Kilcolman are\r\nso mingled, that their contemplation produces a variety of\r\nemotions--admiration for the poem which was created within its\r\nwalls--contemplation of the \"glorious two\" who there spent so much time\r\ntogether in harmony and sweet companionship, despite the storms which\r\nravaged the country; then the awful catastrophe, the burning of the\r\ncastle, and the loss of Spenser's child in the flames, still talked of\r\nin the neighborhood, were certain to make a deep impression on the\r\nimagination of a boy whose delicate health prevented his rushing into\r\nthe amusements and society of children of his own age. There are plenty\r\nof crones in every village, and one at least in every gentleman's house\r\nto watch \"the master's children\" and pour legendary lore into their\r\nwilling ears, accompanied by snatches of song and fairy tale. All these\r\nwere certain to seize upon such an imagination as that of Burke, and lay\r\nthe foundation of much of that high-souled mental poetry--one of his\r\ngreat characteristics; indeed, the circumstances of his youth were\r\nhighly favorable to his peculiar temperament--his delicate constitution\r\nrendered him naturally susceptible of the beautiful; and the locality of\r\nthe Blackwater, and the time-honored ruins of Kilcolman, with its\r\nhistory and traditions, nursed, as they were, by the holy quiet of a\r\ncountry life, had ample time to sink into his soul and germinate the\r\nfruitage which, in after years, attained such rich perfection.\r\n\r\nAn old schoolmaster, of the name of O'Halloran, was his first teacher;\r\nhe \"played at learning\" at the school, long since in ruins; and the\r\nDominie used to boast that \"no matter how great Master Edmund (God bless\r\nhim) was, HE was the first who ever put a Latin grammar into his hands.\"\r\n\r\nEdmund was one of a numerous family; his mother, who had been a Miss\r\nNagle,[1] having had fourteen or fifteen children, all of whom died\r\nyoung, except four,--one sister and three brothers: the sister, Mrs.\r\nFrench, was brought up in the faith of her mother, who was a rigid Roman\r\nCatholic, while the sons were trained in the father's belief. This,\r\nhappily, created no unkindness between them, for not only were they an\r\naffectionate and a united family, but perfectly charitable in their\r\nopinions, each of the other's creed. As the future statesman grew older,\r\nit was considered wise to remove him to Dublin for better instruction,\r\nand he was placed at a school in Smithfield kept by a Mr. James\r\nFitzgerald; but, fortunately for his strength of body and mind, the\r\nreputation of an academy in the lovely valley of Ballitore, founded in\r\nthe midst of a colony of Quakers, by a member of that most benevolent\r\nand intelligent society--the well-known Abraham Shackleton--was\r\nspreading far and wide; and there the three young Burkes were sent in\r\n1741, Edmund being then twelve years old.\r\n\r\nHe was considered not so much brilliant, as of steady application. Here,\r\ntoo, he was remarkable for quick comprehension, and great strength of\r\nmemory; indications which drew forth at first the commendation, and as\r\nhis powers unfolded, the warm regard of his master; under whose paternal\r\ncare the improvement of his health kept pace with that of his intellect,\r\nand the grateful pupil never forgot his obligations: a truly noble mind\r\nis prone to exaggerate kindnesses received, and never detracts from\r\ntheir value; it is only the low and the narrow-minded who underrate the\r\nbenefits they have been blessed with at any period of their lives.\r\n\r\nIn 1743 he entered Trinity College, Dublin, as a pensioner. He gained\r\nfair honors during his residence there, but, like Johnson, Swift,\r\nGoldsmith, and other eminent men, he did not distinguish himself so as\r\nto lead to any speculation as to his after greatness, although his\r\nelders said he was more anxious to acquire knowledge than to display\r\nit;--a valuable testimony. His domestic life was so pure, his\r\nfriendships were so firm, his habits so completely those of a well-bred,\r\nwell-born IRISH GENTLEMAN--mingling, as only Irish gentlemen can do, the\r\nsuavity of the French with the dignity of English manners--that there is\r\nlittle to write about, or speculate upon, beyond his public words and\r\ndeeds.\r\n\r\nLike most young men of his time, his first oratory was exercised at a\r\nclub, and his first efforts as a politician were made in 1749, previous\r\nto his quitting the Dublin University, in some letters against Mr. Henry\r\nBrooke, the author of \"Gustavus Vasa.\" His determination was the bar,\r\nand his entry at the Middle Temple bears date April 23, 1747. His\r\nyouthful impressions of England and its capital are recorded in graceful\r\nlanguage in his letters to those friends whom he never lost, but by\r\ndeath; one passage is as applicable to the present as to the past. \"I\r\ndon't find that genius, the 'rath primrose which forsaken dies,' is\r\npatronized by any of the nobility, so that writers of the first talents\r\nare left to the capricious patronage of the public.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the taste of his time to desire, if not solicit patronage. In our\r\nopinion literature is degraded by _patronage_, while it is honored by\r\nthe friendship of the good and great. Nothing is so loathsome in the\r\nhistory of letters as the debased dedications which men of mind some\r\nyears ago laid at the feet of the so-styled \"patron!\" Literature in our\r\ndays has only to assert its own dignity, to be true and faithful to the\r\nright, to avoid ribaldry, and preserve a noble and brave independence;\r\nand then its importance to the state, as the minister of good, must be\r\nacknowledged. It is only when forgetful of great purposes and great\r\npower, that literature is open to be forgotten or sneered at. Still the\r\nindifference an Englishman feels towards genius, even while enjoying its\r\nfruits, was likely enough to check and chill the enthusiasm of Burke,\r\nand drive him to much mystery as to his early literary engagements. One\r\nof his observations made during his first visit to Westminster Abbey,\r\nwhile hopes and ambitions quickened his throbbing pulse, and he might\r\nhave been pardoned for wishing for a resting-place in the grand\r\nmausoleum of England, is remarkable, as showing how little he changed,\r\nand how completely the youth\r\n\r\n    \"Was father to the man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet after all, do you know that I would rather sleep in the southern\r\ncorner of a country church-yard than in the tomb of the Capulets? I\r\nshould like, however, that my dust should mingle with kindred dust; the\r\ngood old expression, 'family burying-grounds,' has something pleasant in\r\nit, at least to me.\"\r\n\r\nThis was his last, as it seems to have been his first desire; and it has\r\nfound an echo in many a richly dowered heart.\r\n\r\n\"Lay me,\" said Allan Cunningham, \"where the daisies can grow on my\r\ngrave;\" and it is well known that Moore--\r\n\r\n    \"The poet of all circles,\"--\r\n\r\nand, as a poor Irishman once rendered it--\r\n\r\n    \"The _darlint_ of his own,\"\r\n\r\n\r\nhas frequently expressed a desire to be buried at Sloperton beside his\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nThe future orator found the law, as a profession, alien to his habits\r\nand feelings, for at the expiration of the usual term he was not even\r\ncalled to the bar. Some say he desired the professorship of logic at the\r\nUniversity of Glasgow, and even stood the contest; but this has been\r\ndisputed, and if he was rejected, it is matter of congratulation, that\r\nhis talents and time were not confined to so narrow a sphere. At that\r\nperiod his mind was occupied by his theories on the Sublime and\r\nBeautiful, which were finally condensed and published in the shape of\r\nthat essay which roused the world to admiration.\r\n\r\nMr. Prior says, and with every show of reason, \"that Mr. Burke's\r\nambition of being distinguished in literature, seems to have been one of\r\nhis earliest, as it was one of his latest, passions.\" His first avowed\r\nwork was \"The Vindication of Natural Society;\" but he wrote a great deal\r\nanonymously; and the essay on \"The Sublime and Beautiful,\" triumphant as\r\nit was, must have caused him great anxiety; he began it before he was\r\nnineteen, and kept it by him for seven years before it was published--a\r\nvaluable lesson to those who rush into print and mistake the desire for\r\ncelebrity, for the power which bestows immortality.\r\n\r\nThe literature which is pursued chiefly in solitude, is always the best\r\nsort: society, which cheers and animates men in most employments, is an\r\nimpediment to an author if really warmed by true genius, and impelled by\r\na sacred love of truth not to fritter away his thoughts or be tempted to\r\ninsincerity.\r\n\r\nThe genius and noble mind of Burke constituted him a high priest of\r\nliterature; the lighter, and it might be the more pleasurable enjoyments\r\nof existence, could not be tasted without interfering with his pursuits;\r\nbut he knew his duty to his God, to the world, and to himself, and the\r\nresponsibility alone was sufficiently weighty to bend a delicate frame,\r\neven when there was no necessity for laboring to live--but where an\r\nobject is to be attained, principles put forth or combated, God or man\r\nto be served, the necessity for exertion always exists, and the great\r\nsoul must go forth on its mission.\r\n\r\nThat sooner or later this strife, or love, or duty--pursued\r\nbravely--must tell upon all who even covet and enjoy their labor, the\r\nexperience of the past has recorded; and Edmund Burke, even at that\r\nearly period of life, was ordered to try the effects of a visit to Bath\r\nand Bristol, then the principal resort of the invalids of the United\r\nKingdom.\r\n\r\nAt Bath he exchanged one malady for another, for he became attached to\r\nMiss Nugent, the daughter of his physician, and in a very little time\r\nformed what, in a worldly point of view, would be considered an\r\nimprudent marriage, but which secured the happiness of his future life;\r\nshe was a Roman Catholic; but, however unfortunate dissenting creeds are\r\nin many instances, in this it never disturbed the harmony of their\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nShe was a woman exactly calculated to create happiness; possessing\r\naccomplishments, goodness of heart, sweetness of disposition and\r\nmanners, veneration for talent, a hopeful spirit to allay her husband's\r\nanxieties, wisdom and love to meet his ruffled temper, and tenderness to\r\nsubdue it--qualities which made him frequently declare \"that every care\r\nvanished the moment he sheltered beneath his own roof.\"\r\n\r\nEdmund Burke became a husband, and also continued a lover--and once\r\npresented to his ladylove, on the anniversary of their marriage, his\r\nidea of \"a perfect wife.\"[2]\r\n\r\nFor a considerable time after his marriage Burke toiled as a literary\r\nman, living at Battersea or in town, now writing, it is believed,\r\njointly with his brother Richard and his cousin William a work on the\r\n\"European Settlements in America,\" in two volumes, which, according to\r\ntradition, brought him, or them, only fifty pounds! then planning and\r\ncommencing an abridgment of the \"History of England.\"\r\n\r\nStruggling, it may be with difficulties brought on by his generous\r\nnature, and which his father's allowance of two hundred a year, and his\r\nown industry and perseverance could hardly overcome, the birth of a son\r\nwas an additional stimulant to exertion, and, in conjunction with\r\nDodsley, he established the _Annual Register_. This work he never\r\nacknowledged, but his best biographers have no doubt of his having\r\nbrought forth and nurtured this useful publication. A hundred pounds a\r\nvolume seems to have been the sum paid for this labor; and Burke's\r\nreceipts for the money were at one time in the possession of Mr. Upcott.\r\n\r\nLong before he obtained a seat in Parliament he won the esteem of Doctor\r\nJohnson, who bore noble testimony to his virtue and talent, and what he\r\nespecially admired, and called, his \"affluence of conversation.\"\r\n\r\nFor a time he went to Ireland as private secretary to Mr. Hamilton,\r\ndistinguished from all others of his name as \"single-speech Hamilton;\"\r\nbut disagreeing with this person, he nobly threw up a pension of three\r\nhundred a year, because of the unreasonable and derogatory claims made\r\nupon his gratitude by Hamilton, who had procured it for him.\r\n\r\nWhile in Dublin he made acquaintance with the genius of the painter\r\nBarry, and though his own means were limited, he persuaded him to come\r\nto England, and received him in his house in Queen Anne-street, where he\r\nsoon procured him employment; he already numbered Mr., afterwards Sir\r\nJoshua, Reynolds amongst his friends; and his correspondence with Barry\r\nmight almost be considered a young painter's manual, so full is it of\r\nthe better parts of taste, wisdom, and knowledge.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke was then on the threshold of Parliament, Lord Verney arranging\r\nfor his _debut_ as member for Wendover, in Buckinghamshire, under the\r\nRockingham administration; another star was added to the galaxy of that\r\nbrilliant assembly, and if we had space it could not be devoted to a\r\nbetter purpose than to trace his glorious career in the senate; but that\r\nis before all who read the history of the period, and we prefer to\r\nfollow his footsteps in the under current of private life.\r\n\r\nHe was too successful to escape the poisoned arrows of envy, or the\r\nmisrepresentations of the disappointed. Certain persons exclaimed\r\nagainst his want of consistency, and gave as a reason that at one\r\nperiod he commanded the spirit of liberty with which the French\r\nRevolution commenced, and after a time turned away in horror and disgust\r\nfrom a people who made murder a pastime, and converted Paris into a\r\nshambles for human flesh.\r\n\r\nBut nothing could permanently obscure the fame of the eloquent Irishman,\r\nhe continued to act with such worthiness, that, despite his schism with\r\nCharles James Fox, \"the people\" did him the justice to believe, that in\r\nhis public conduct, he had no one view but the public good.\r\n\r\nHe outlived calumny, uniting unto genius diligence, and unto diligence\r\npatience, and unto patience enthusiasm, and to these, deep-hearted\r\nenthusiasm, with a knowledge, not only, it would seem, of all things,\r\nbut of such ready application, that in illustration or argument his\r\nresources were boundless; the wisdom of the Ancients was as familiar to\r\nhim as the improved state of modern politics, science, and laws; the\r\nmetaphysics and logic of the Schools were to him as household words, and\r\nhis memory was gemmed with whatever was most valuable in poetry,\r\nhistory, and the arts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREGORIES.]\r\n\r\nAfter much toil, and the lapse of some time, he purchased a domain in\r\nBuckinghamshire, called \"Gregories;\" there, whenever his public duties\r\ngave him leisure, he enjoyed the repose so necessary to an overtaxed\r\nbrain; and from Gregories some of his most interesting letters are\r\ndated.[3] Those addressed to the painter Barry, _whom his liberality\r\nsent to and supported in Rome_, are, as we have said, replete with art\r\nand wisdom; and the delicacy of both him and his excellent brother\r\nRichard, while entreating the rough-hewn genius to prosecute his studies\r\nand give them pleasure by his improvement, are additional proofs of the\r\nbeautiful union of the brothers, and of their _oneness_ of purpose and\r\ndetermination that Barry should never be cramped by want of means.[4]\r\n\r\nAfter the purchase of Gregories[5] Mr. Burke had no settled town-house,\r\nmerely occupying one for the season. In one of his letters to Barry, he\r\ntells him to direct to Charles-street, St. James's Square; he writes\r\nalso from Fludyer-street, Westminster, and from Gerrard-street, Soho;\r\nbut traces of his \"whereabouts\" are next to impossible to find. Barry\r\nwas not the only artist who profited by Edmund Burke's liberality.\r\nBarret, the landscape-painter, had fallen into difficulties, and the\r\nfact coming to the orator's ears during his short tenure in power, he\r\nbestowed upon him a place in Chelsea Hospital, which he enjoyed during\r\nthe remainder of his life.\r\n\r\nIndeed, this great man's noble love of Art was part and parcel of\r\nhimself; it was no affectation, and it led to genuine sympathy with, not\r\nonly the artist's triumphs, but his difficulties. He found time, amid\r\nall his occupations, to write letters to the irritable Barry, and if the\r\npainter had followed their counsel, he would have secured his peace and\r\nprosperity; but it was far otherwise: his conduct, both in Rome and\r\nafter his return to England, gave his friend just cause of offence;\r\nthough, like all others who offended the magnanimous Burke, he was soon\r\nforgiven.\r\n\r\nHe never forgot his Irish friends, or the necessities of those who lived\r\non the family estate; the expansive generosity of his nature did not\r\nprevent his attending to the minor comforts of his dependants, and his\r\nletters \"home\" frequently breathe a most loving and careful spirit, that\r\nthe sorrows of the poor might be ameliorated, and their wants relieved.\r\n\r\nWe ought to have mentioned before that Mr. and Mrs. Burke's marriage was\r\nonly blessed by two sons; one died in childhood, the eldest grew up a\r\nyoung man of the warmest affections, and blessed with a considerable\r\nshare of talent; to his parents he was every thing they could desire;\r\ntowards his mother he exhibited the tenderness and devotion of a\r\ndaughter, and his demeanor to his father was that of an obedient son,\r\nand most faithful friend; at intervals he enjoyed with them the pleasure\r\nthey experienced in receiving guests of the highest consideration;\r\namongst them the eccentric Madame de Genlis, who put their politeness to\r\nthe test by the exercise of her peculiarities, and horrified the meek\r\nand amiable Sir Joshua Reynolds by the assumption of talents she did not\r\npossess.\r\n\r\nThe publication of his reflections on the French Revolution, which,\r\nperhaps, never would have seen the light but for the rupture with Mr.\r\nSheridan, which caused his opinions to be misunderstood, brought down\r\nthe applause of Europe on a head then wearying of public life.\r\n\r\nBut, perhaps, a tribute Burke valued more than any, remembering the\r\nadage--an adage which, unhappily, especially applies to Ireland--\"no man\r\nis a prophet in his own country,\" was, that on a motion of the provost\r\nof Trinity College, Dublin, in 1790, the honorary degree of LL.D. was\r\nconferred upon him in full convocation, and an address afterwards\r\npresented in a gold box, to express the University's sense of his\r\nservices. When he replied to this distinguished compliment, his town\r\nresidence was in \"Duke-street, St. James.\"\r\n\r\nHis term of life--over-tasked as it was--might have been extended to a\r\nmuch longer period, but that his deeply affectionate nature, as time\r\npassed on, experienced several of those shocks inseparable from even\r\nmoderate length of days; many of his friends died; among others, his\r\nsister and his brother; but still the wife of his bosom and his son were\r\nwith him--that son whose talents he rated as superior to his own, whom\r\nhe had consulted for some years on almost every subject, whether of a\r\npublic or a private nature, that occurred, and very frequently preferred\r\nhis judgment to his own. This beloved son had attained the age of\r\nthirty-four, when he was seized with rapid consumption. When the malady\r\nwas recognized and acknowledged, his father took him to Brompton, then,\r\nas now, considered the best air for those affected with this cruel\r\nmalady. \"Cromwell House,\" chosen as their temporary residence, is\r\nstanding still, though there is little doubt the rage for extending\r\nLondon through this once sequestered and rural suburb, will soon raze it\r\nto the ground, as it has done others of equal interest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROMWELL HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nWe have always regarded \"Cromwell House,\" as it is called, with\r\nveneration. In our earliest acquaintance with a neighborhood, in which\r\nwe lived so long and still love so well, this giant dwelling, staring\r\nwith its whited walls and balconied roof over the tangled gardens which\r\nseemed to cut it off from all communication with the world, was\r\nassociated with our \"Hero Worship\" of Oliver Cromwell. We were told he\r\nhad lived there (what neighborhood has not its \"Cromwell House?\")--that\r\nthe ghastly old place had private staircases and subterranean\r\npassages--some underground communication with Kensington--that there\r\nwere doors in the walls, and out of the walls; and, that if not careful\r\nyou might be precipitated through trap-doors into some unfathomable\r\nabyss, and encounter the ghost of old Oliver himself. These tales\r\noperated upon our imagination in the usual way; and many and many a\r\nmoonlight evening, while wandering in those green lanes--now obliterated\r\nby Onslow and Thurloe Squares--and listening to the nightingales, have\r\nwe watched the huge shadows cast by that solitary and melancholy-looking\r\nhouse, and, as we have said, associated it with the stern and grand\r\nProtector of England. Upon closer investigation, how grieved we have\r\noften been to discover the truth, for it destroyed not only our castles\r\nin the air, but their inhabitants; we found that Oliver never resided\r\nthere, but that his son, Richard, had, and was a rate payer to the\r\nparish of Kensington for some time. To this lonely sombre house Mr. and\r\nMrs. Burke and their son removed, in the hope that the soft mild air of\r\nthis salubrious neighborhood might restore his failing strength; the\r\nconsciousness of his being in danger was something too terrible for them\r\nto think of. He had just received a new appointment--an appointment\r\nsuited to his tastes and expectations; he must take possession of it in\r\na little time. He was their child, their friend, their treasure, their\r\nall! Surely God would spare him to close their eyes. How could death and\r\nhe meet together? They entreated him of God, by prayer, and\r\nsupplication, and tears that flowed until their eyes were dry and their\r\neyelids parched--but all in vain. The man, in his prime of manhood, was\r\nstricken down; we transcribe, from an article in the _Quarterly Review_,\r\non \"Fontenelle's Signs of Death,\" the brief account of his last moments:\r\n\r\n\"Burke's son, upon whom his father has conferred something of his own\r\ncelebrity, heard his parents sobbing in another room at the prospect of\r\nan event they knew to be inevitable. He rose from his bed, joined his\r\nillustrious father, and endeavored to engage him in a cheerful\r\nconversation. Burke continued silent, choked with grief. His son again\r\nmade an effort to console him. 'I am under no terror,' he said; 'I feel\r\nmyself better and in spirits, and yet my heart flutters, I know not why.\r\nPray, talk to me, sir! talk of religion; talk of morality; talk, if you\r\nwill, of indifferent subjects.' Here a noise attracted his notice, and\r\nhe exclaimed, 'Does it rain?--No; it is the rustling of the wind through\r\nthe trees.' The whistling of the wind and the waving of the trees\r\nbrought Milton's majestic lines to his mind, and he repeated them with\r\nuncommon grace and effect:\r\n\r\n    'His praise, ye winds, that from four quarters blow,\r\n    Breathe soft or loud; and wave your tops, ye pines,\r\n    With every plant, in sign of worship wave!'\r\n\r\nA second time he took up the sublime and melodious strain, and,\r\naccompanying the action to the word, waved his own hand in token of\r\nworship, and sank into the arms of his father--a corpse. Not a sensation\r\ntold him that in an instant he would stand in the presence of the\r\nCreator to whom his body was bent in homage, and whose praises still\r\nresounded from his lips.\"\r\n\r\nThe account which all the biographies of Burke give of the effect this\r\nbereavement produced upon his parents is most fearful even to read; what\r\nmust it have been to witness? His mother seems to have regained her\r\nself-possession sooner than his father. In one of his letters to the\r\nlate Baron Smith, he writes--\"So heavy a calamity has fallen upon me as\r\nto disable me from business, and disqualifies me for repose. The\r\nexistence I have--_I do not know that I can call life_. * * Good nights\r\nto you--I never have any.\" And again--\"The life which has been so\r\nembittered cannot long endure. The grave will soon close over me, and my\r\ndejections.\" To Lord Auckland he writes--\"For myself, or for my family\r\n(alas! I have none), I have nothing to hope or to fear in this world.\"\r\nAnd again in another letter--\"The storm has gone over me, and I lie like\r\none of those old oaks which the late hurricane has scattered about me. I\r\nam stripped of all my honors, I lie prostrate on the earth; I am alone,\r\nI have none to meet my enemies in the gate. I greatly deceive myself, if\r\nin this hard season of life, I would give a peck of refuse wheat for all\r\nthat is called fame and honor in the world.\"\r\n\r\nThere is some thing in the \"wail\" and character of these laments that\r\nrecalls the mournful Psalms of David; like the Psalmist he endeavored to\r\nbe comforted, but it was by an effort. His political career was shrouded\r\nfor ever--the _motive_ to his great exertions was destroyed--but his\r\nmind, wrecked as it had been, could not remain inactive. In 1795 his\r\n_private_ reply to Mr. Smith's letter, requesting his opinion of the\r\nexpediency of and necessity for Catholic Emancipation, got into public\r\ncirculation; and in that singular document, though he did not enter into\r\nthe details of the question with as much minuteness as he would\r\npreviously have done, he pleaded for the removal of the whole of the\r\ndisabilities of the Roman Catholic body. From time to time he put forth\r\na small work on some popular question. He originated several plans for\r\nbenefiting the poor in his own neighborhood. He had a windmill in his\r\npark for the purpose of supplying the poor with cheap bread, which bread\r\nwas served at his own table; and, as if clinging to the memory of the\r\nyouth of his son, he formed a plan for the establishment of an emigrant\r\nschool at Penn, where the children of those who had perished by the\r\nguillotine or the sword amid the French convulsions, could be received,\r\nsupported, and educated. He made a generous appeal to government for the\r\nbenefit of these children, which was as generously responded to. The\r\nhouse appropriated to this humane purpose had been inhabited by Burke's\r\nold friend, General Haviland; and after his death several emigre French\r\npriests sheltered within its walls. Until his last fatal illness Mr.\r\nBurke watched over the establishment with the solicitude of a friend and\r\nthe tenderness of a father. The Lords of the Treasury allowed fifty\r\npounds per month for its sustenance: the Marquis of Buckingham made them\r\na present of a brass cannon and a stand of colors. When the Bourbons\r\nwere restored in 1814 they relieved the government from this charge, and\r\nthe institution was dissolved in 1820; in 1822 \"Tyler's Green House,\" as\r\nit was called, was sold in lots, pulled down, and carried away; thus,\r\nBurke's own dwelling being destroyed by fire, and this building,\r\nsanctified by his sympathy and goodness, razed to the ground, little\r\nremains to mark the locality of places where all the distinguished men\r\nof the age congregated around \"the Burkes,\" and where Edmund, almost to\r\nthe last, extended hospitalities, coveted and appreciated by all who had\r\nany pretensions to be considered as distinguished either by talent or\r\nfortune.\r\n\r\nIt has frequently struck us as strange, the morbid avidity with which\r\nthe world seizes upon the slightest evidence of abstraction in great\r\nmen, to declare that their minds are fading, or impoverished: the public\r\ngapes for every trifle calculated to prove that the palsied fingers can\r\nno longer grasp the intellectual sceptre, and that the well-worn and\r\nhard-earned bays are as a crown of thorns to the pulseless brow. It was,\r\nin those days whispered in London that the great orator had become\r\nimbecile immediately after the publication of his \"_Letter to a Noble\r\nLord_;\" and that he wandered about his park kissing his cows and horses.\r\n\r\nA noble friend went immediately to Beaconsfield to ascertain the truth,\r\nand was delighted to find Mr. Burke anxious to read him passages from \"A\r\nRegicide Peace,\" which he was then writing; after a little delicate\r\nmanoeuvring on his part, to ascertain the truth, Mr. Burke told him a\r\ntouching incident which proved the origin of this calumny on his\r\nintellectual powers.\r\n\r\nAn old horse, a great favorite of his son's, and his constant companion,\r\nwhen both were full of life and health, had been turned out at the death\r\nof his master, to take his run of the park for the remainder of his\r\nlife, at ease, with strict injunctions to the servants that he should\r\nneither be ridden, nor molested by any one. While musing one day,\r\nloitering along, Mr. Burke perceived this worn-out old servant come\r\nclose up to him, and at length, after some moments spent in viewing his\r\nperson, followed by seeming recollection and confidence, he deliberately\r\nrested his head upon his bosom. The singularity of the action itself,\r\nthe remembrance of his dead son, its late master, who occupied so much\r\nof his thoughts at all times, and the apparent attachment, tenderness\r\nand intelligence of the creature towards him--as if it could sympathize\r\nwith his inward sorrow--rushing at once into his mind, totally\r\noverpowered his firmness, and throwing his arms over its neck, he wept\r\nlong and loudly.\r\n\r\nBut though his lucid and beautiful mind, however agonized, remained\r\nunclouded to the last, and his affections glowed towards his old friends\r\nas warmly as ever, his bodily health was failing fast; one of the last\r\nletters he ever dictated was to Mary Leadbeater, the daughter of his old\r\nfriend and master, Shackleton; this lady was subsequently well known in\r\nIreland as the author of \"Cottage Dialogues.\" The first literary\r\nattempt, we believe, made towards the improvement of the lower order of\r\nIrish, was by her faithful and earnest pen; to this letter,\r\ncongratulating her on the birth of a son, is a PS. where the invalid\r\nsays:--\"I have been at Bath these four months to no purpose, and am\r\ntherefore to be removed to my own house at Beaconsfield to-morrow, _to\r\nbe nearer to a habitation more permanent, humbly_ and fearfully hoping\r\nthat my better part may find a better mansion!\"\r\n\r\nIt would seem as if he anticipated the hour of his passing away. He sent\r\nsweet messages of loving-kindness to all his friends, entreating and\r\nexchanging pardons; recapitulated his motives of action on various\r\npolitical emergencies; gave directions as to his funeral, and then\r\nlistened with attention to some serious papers of Addison on religious\r\nsubjects and on the immortality of the soul. His attendants after this\r\nwere in the act of removing him to his bed, when indistinctly invoking a\r\nblessing on all around him, he sunk down and expired on the 9th of July,\r\n1797, in the sixty-eighth year of his age.\r\n\r\n\"His end,\" said his friend Doctor Lawrence, \"was suited to the simple\r\ngreatness of mind which he displayed through life; every way unaffected,\r\nwithout levity, without ostentation, full of natural grace and dignity,\r\nhe appeared neither to wish nor to dread, but patiently and placidly to\r\nawait the appointed hour of his dissolution.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TOMB OF EDMUND BURKE.]\r\n\r\nIt was almost impossible to people, in fancy, the tattered and neglected\r\nchurchyard of Beaconsfield as it now is--with those who swelled the\r\nfuneral pomp of the greatest ornament of the British senate; to imagine\r\nthe titled pall-bearers, where the swine were tumbling over graves, and\r\nrooting at headstones. Seldom, perhaps never, in England, had we seen a\r\nchurchyard so little cared for as that, where the tomb of Waller[6]\r\nrenders the surrounding disorder \"in a sacred place\" more conspicuous by\r\nits lofty pretension, and where the church is regarded as the mausoleum\r\nof Edmund Burke.[7] Surely the \"decency of churchyards\" ought to be\r\nenforced, if those to whom they should be sacred trusts, neglect or\r\nforget their duty. That the churchyard of Beaconsfield, which has long\r\nbeen considered \"a shrine,\" should be suffered to remain in the state in\r\nwhich we saw it, is a disgrace not only to the town, but to England; it\r\nwas differently cared for during Burke's lifetime, and though, like that\r\nof the revered Queen Dowager, his Will expressed a disinclination to\r\nposthumous honors, and unnecessary expense, never were mourners more\r\nsincere--never did there arise to the blue vault of heaven the incense\r\nof greater, and more deep-felt sorrow, than from the multitude who\r\nassembled in and around the church, while the mortal remains of Edmund\r\nBurke were placed in the same vault with his son and brother.\r\n\r\nThe tablet to his memory, placed on the wall of the south aisle of the\r\nchurch, records his last resting-place with the relatives just named; as\r\nwell as the fact of the same grave containing the body of his \"entirely\r\nbeloved and incomparable wife,\" who died in 1812, at the age of 76.\r\n\r\nDeeply do we deplore that the dwelling where he enjoyed so much that\r\nrenders life happy, and suffered what sanctifies and prepares us for a\r\nbetter world, exists no longer; but his name is incorporated with our\r\nhistory, and adds another to the list of the great men who have been\r\ncalled into life and received their first and best impressions in\r\nIreland; and if Ireland had given nothing to her more prosperous sister\r\nthan the extraordinary men of the past and present century, she merits\r\nher gratitude for the gifts which bestow so much honor and glory on the\r\nUnited Kingdoms.\r\n\r\nMrs. Burke, previous to her death, sold the mansion to her neighbor, Mr.\r\nJohn Du Pre, of Wilton Park. Mrs. Haviland, Mr. Burke's niece, lived\r\nwith her to the last, though she did not receive the portion of her\r\nfortune to which she was considered entitled. Her son, Thomas Haviland\r\nBurke, grand-nephew of Edmund, became the lineal representative of the\r\nfamily; but the library, and all the tokens of respect and admiration\r\nwhich he received from the good, and from the whole world, went with the\r\nproperty to _Mrs. Burke's_ nephew, Mr. Nugent. Some of the sculpture\r\nwhich ornamented the house now graces the British Museum.\r\n\r\nThe mansion was burnt on the 23d of April, 1813. The ground where it\r\nstood is unequal; and some of the park wall remains, and fine old trees\r\nstill flourish, beneath whose shade we picture the meeting between the\r\nmourning father and the favorite horse of his lost son.\r\n\r\nThere is a full-length portrait of Edmund Burke in the Examination Hall\r\nof the Dublin University. All such portraits should be copied, and\r\npreserved in our own Houses of Parliament, a meet honor to the dead, and\r\na stimulant to the living to \"go and do likewise.\" It hardly realizes,\r\nhowever, the _ideal_ of Burke; perhaps no portrait could. What Miss\r\nEdgeworth called the \"ground-plan of the face\" is there; but we must\r\nimagine the varying expression, the light of the bright quick eyes, the\r\neloquence of the unclosed lips, the storm which could gather\r\nthunder-clouds on the well-formed brow; but we have far exceeded our\r\nlimits without exhausting our subject, and, with Dr. Parr, still would\r\nspeak of Burke:\r\n\r\n\"Of Burke, by whose sweetness Athens herself would have been soothed,\r\nwith whose amplitude and exuberance she would have been enraptured and\r\non whose lips that prolific mother of genius and science would have\r\nadored, confessed--the Goddess of Persuasion.\"\r\n\r\nAlas! we have lingered long at his shrine, and yet our praise is not\r\nhalf spoken.\r\n\r\n--[The notes and drawings for this paper were contributed by F. W.\r\nFairhold, of the Society of Antiquaries.]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Sylvanus Spenser, the eldest son of the Poet Spenser, married Ellen\r\nNagle, eldest daughter of David Nagle, Esq., ancestor of the lady, who\r\nwas mother to Edmund Burke.\r\n\r\n[2] This as a picture is outlined with so delicate a pencil, and colored\r\nwith such mingled purity and richness of tone, that we transcribe a few\r\npassages, as much in honor of the man who could write, as the woman who\r\ncould inspire such praise:--\r\n\r\n\"The character of ----\r\n\r\n\"She is handsome, but it is beauty not arising from features, from\r\ncomplexion, or from shape. She has all three in a high degree, but it is\r\nnot by these she touches a heart; it is all that sweetness of temper,\r\nbenevolence, innocence, and sensibility, which a face can express, that\r\nforms her beauty. She has a face that just raises your attention at\r\nfirst sight; it grows on you every moment, and you wonder it did no more\r\nthan raise your attention at first.\r\n\r\n\"Her eyes have a mild light, but they awe when she pleases; they command\r\nlike a good man out of office, not by authority, but by virtue.\r\n\r\n\"Her stature is not tall, she is not made to be the admiration of every\r\nbody, but the happiness of one.\r\n\r\n\"She has all the firmness that does not exclude delicacy--she has all\r\nthe softness that does not imply weakness. * *\r\n\r\n\"Her voice is a soft, low, music, not formed to rule in public\r\nassemblies, but to charm those who can distinguish a company from a\r\ncrowd: it has this advantage--_you must come close to her to hear it_.\r\n\r\n\"To describe her body, describes her mind; one is the transcript of the\r\nother; her understanding is not shown in the variety of matters it\r\nexerts itself on, but in the goodness of the choice she makes.\r\n\r\n\"She does not display it so much in saying or doing striking things, as\r\nin avoiding such as she ought _not_ to say or do.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"No persons of so few years can know the world better; no person was\r\never less corrupted by the knowledge.\r\n\r\n\"Her politeness flows rather from a natural disposition to oblige, than\r\nfrom any rules on that subject, and therefore never fails to strike\r\nthose who understand good breeding, and those who do not.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"She has a steady and firm mind, _which takes no more from the solidity\r\nof the female character, than the solidity of marble does from its\r\npolish and lustre_.

Mrs. Burke, before her death, sold the\r\nmansion to her neighbor, Mr. John Du Pre, of Wilton Park. It was\r\ndestroyed by fire soon afterwards.\r\n\r\n[4] During Barry's five years' residence abroad he earned nothing for\r\nhimself, and received no supplies save from Edmund and Richard Burke.\r\n\r\n[5] Mr. Prior says in his admirable Life of Burke--\"How the money to\r\neffect this purchase was procured has given rise to many surmises and\r\nreports; a considerable portion was his own, the bequest of his father\r\nand elder brother. The Marquis of Rockingham offered the loan of the\r\namount required to complete the purchase; the Marquis was under\r\nobligations to him publicly, and privately for some attention paid to\r\nthe business of his large estates in Ireland. Less disinterested men\r\nwould have settled the matter otherwise--the one by quartering his\r\nfriend, the other, by being quartered, on the public purse. To the honor\r\nof both, a different course was pursued.\"\r\n\r\n[6] Waller was a resident in this vicinity, in which his landed property\r\nchiefly lay. He lived in the family mansion named Well's Court, a\r\nproperty still in the possession of his descendants. His tomb is a table\r\nmonument of white marble, upon which rises a pyramid, resting on skulls\r\nwith bat's wings; it is a peculiar but picturesque addition to the\r\nchurchyard, and, from its situation close to the walk, attracts much\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n[7] Our engraving exhibits his simple tablet, as seen from the central\r\naisle of the church, immediately in front of the pew in which Burke and\r\nhis family always sat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOEMS BY S. G. GOODRICH[8]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the last twenty years the name of Mr. Goodrich has been very\r\nconstantly associated with American literature. He commenced as a\r\npublisher, in Boston, and was among the first to encourage by liberal\r\ncopyrights, and to make attractive by elegant editions, the works of\r\nAmerican authors. One of his earliest undertakings was a collection of\r\nthe novels of Charles Brockden Brown, with a memoir of that author, by\r\nhis widow, with whom he shared the profits. In 1828 he began \"The\r\nToken,\" an annual literary souvenir, which he edited and published\r\nfourteen years. In this appeared the first fruits of the genius of\r\nCheney, who has long been acknowledged the master of American engravers;\r\nand the first poems and prose writings of Longfellow, Willis, Mellen,\r\nMrs. Osgood, Mrs. Child, Mrs. Sigourney, and other eminent authors. In\r\n\"The Token\" also were printed his own earlier lyrical pieces. The work\r\nwas of the first rank in its class, and in England as well as in this\r\ncountry it was uniformly praised.\r\n\r\nIn 1831 an anonymous romance was published by Marsh & Capen, of Boston.\r\nIt was attributed by some to Willis, and by others to Mrs. Child, then\r\nMiss Francis. It illustrated a fine and peculiar genius, but was soon\r\nforgotten. Mr. Goodrich appreciated its merits, and applied to the\r\npublishers for the name of the author, that he might engage him as a\r\ncontributor to \"The Token.\" They declined to disclose his secret, but\r\noffered to forward a letter to him. Mr. Goodrich wrote one, and received\r\nan answer signed by NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE, many of whose best productions,\r\nas \"Sights from a Steeple,\" \"Sketches under an Umbrella,\" \"The Prophetic\r\nPictures,\" \"Canterbury Pilgrims,\" &c., appeared in this annual. In 1839,\r\nMr. Goodrich suggested to Mr. Hawthorne the publication of a collection\r\nof his tales, surrendering his copyrights to several of them for this\r\npurpose; but so little were the extraordinary qualities of this\r\nadmirable author then understood, that the publishers would not venture\r\nupon such an experiment without an assurance against loss, which Mr.\r\nGoodrich, as his friend, therefore gave. The public judgment will be\r\nentitled to little respect, if the copyright of the works of Hawthorne\r\nbe not hereafter a most ample fortune.\r\n\r\nMr. Goodrich soon abandoned the business of publishing, and, though\r\nstill editing \"The Token,\" devoted his attention chiefly to the writing\r\nof that series of educational works, known as _Peter Parley's_, which\r\nhas spread his fame over the world. The whole number of these volumes is\r\nabout sixty. Among them are treatises upon a great variety of subjects,\r\nand they are remarkable for simplicity of style and felicity of\r\nillustration. Mr. Goodrich has accomplished a complete and important\r\nrevolution in juvenile reading, substituting truth and nature for\r\ngrotesque fiction in the materials and processes of instruction, and\r\nhis method has been largely imitated, at home and abroad. In England\r\nmany authors and publishers have disgraced the literary profession by\r\nworks under the name of \"Parley,\" with which he has had nothing to do,\r\nand which have none of his wise and genial spirit.\r\n\r\nBesides his writings under this pseudonym, Mr. Goodrich has produced\r\nseveral works of a more ambitious character, which have been eminently\r\npopular. Among them is a series entitled \"The Cabinet Library,\"\r\nembracing histories, biographies, and essays in science; \"Universal\r\nGeography,\" in an octavo volume of one thousand pages; and a \"History of\r\nall Nations,\" in two large octavos, in which he has displayed such\r\nresearch, analysis, and generalization, as should insure for him an\r\nhonorable rank among historians. We cannot better illustrate his\r\npopularity than by stating the fact, that more than four hundred\r\nthousand volumes of his various productions are now annually sold in\r\nthis country and Europe. No living writer is, therefore, as much read,\r\nand in the United States hardly a citizen now makes his first appearance\r\nat the polls, or a bride at the altar, to whose education he has not in\r\na large degree contributed. For twenty years he has preserved the\r\nconfidence of parents and teachers of every variety of condition and\r\nopinion, by the indefectible morality and strong practical sense, which\r\nare universally understood and approved.\r\n\r\nLike many other eminent persons, Mr. Goodrich lets sought occasional\r\nrelaxation from the main pursuits of his life in poetry, and the volume\r\nbefore us contains some forty illustrations of his abilities, as a\r\nworshipper of the muse whose temples are most thronged, but who is most\r\ncoy and most chary of her inspiration. They have for the most part been\r\npreviously printed in \"The Token,\" or in literary journals, but a few\r\nare now published the first time. In typographical and pictorial\r\nelegance the book is unique. It is an exhibition of the success of the\r\nfirst attempt to rival the London and Paris publishers in woodcut\r\nembellishment and general beauty of execution.\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Goodrich possesses the poetical faculty in an eminent degree,\r\nno one has doubted who has read his fine lines \"To Lake Superior:\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    Father of Lakes! thy waters bend,\r\n      Beyond the eagle's utmost view,\r\n    When, throned in heaven, he sees thee send\r\n      Back to the sky its world of blue.\r\n\r\n    Boundless and deep the forests weave\r\n      Their twilight shade thy borders o'er,\r\n    And threatening cliffs, like giants, heave\r\n      Their rugged forms along thy shore.\r\n\r\n    Nor can the light canoes, that glide\r\n      Across thy breast like things of air,\r\n    Chase from thy lone and level tide,\r\n      The spell of stillness deepening there.\r\n\r\n    Yet round this waste of wood and wave,\r\n      Unheard, unseen, a spirit lives,\r\n    That, breathing o'er each rock and cave,\r\n      To all, a wild, strange aspect gives.\r\n\r\n    The thunder-riven oak, that flings\r\n      Its grisly arms athwart the sky,\r\n    A sudden, startling image brings\r\n      To the lone traveller's kindled eye.\r\n\r\n    The gnarled and braided boughs that show\r\n      Their dim forms in the forest shade,\r\n    Like wrestling serpents seem, and throw\r\n      Fantastic horrors through the glade.\r\n\r\n    The very echoes round this shore,\r\n      Have caught a strange and gibbering tone,\r\n    For they have told the war-whoop o'er,\r\n      Till the wild chorus is their own.\r\n\r\n    Wave of the wilderness, adieu--\r\n      Adieu, ye rocks, ye wilds, ye woods!\r\n    Roll on, thou Element of blue,\r\n      And fill these awful solitudes!\r\n\r\n    Thou hast no tale to tell of man.\r\n      God is thy theme. Ye sounding caves,\r\n    Whisper of Him, whose mighty plan,\r\n      Deems as a bubble all your waves!\r\n\r\nThe \"Birth Night of the Humming Birds\" has been declared by the London\r\n_Athenaeum_ equal to Dr. Drake's \"Culprit Fay,\" and it may be regarded as\r\nin its way the best specimen of Mr. Goodrich's talents. It is too long\r\nto be quoted in these paragraphs. In descriptions of nature he is\r\nuniformly successful, presenting his picture with force and\r\ndistractness.\r\n\r\nThere are many examples of this in one of his longest poems, \"The\r\nMississippi,\" in which the traditions that cluster around the Father of\r\nWaters, and the advances of civility along his borders, are graphically\r\npresented. The river is described as rising.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    \"Far in the west, where snow-capt mountain's rise,\r\n      Like marble shafts beneath heaven's stooping dome,\r\n    And sunset's charming curtain drapes the skies\r\n      As if Enchantment there would build her home.\r\n\r\nThe bard laments that\r\n\r\n            \"though these scenes are fair\r\n    As fabled Arcady, the sylph and fay,\r\n      And all their gentle kindred, shun the air,\r\n    Where car and steamer make their stormy way;\"\r\n\r\nYet trusts that in a future time,\r\n\r\n    \"Perchance some Cooper's magic art may wake\r\n      The sleeping legends of this mighty vale,\r\n    And twine fond memories round the lawn and lake,\r\n      Where Warrior fought or Lover told his tale.\r\n\r\nIn the volume are several allegorical pieces of much merit, of which the\r\nmost noticeable are the \"Two Windmills,\" \"The Bubble Chase,\" and \"The\r\nRainbow Bridge.\" Several smaller poems are distinguished for a quaint\r\nsimplicity, reminding us of the old masters of English verse; and\r\nothers, for refined sentiment, as the \"Old Oak,\" of which the key-note\r\nis in the lines,\r\n\r\n    Here is the grassy knoll I used to seek\r\n      At summer noon, beneath the spreading shade,\r\n    And watch the flowers that stooped, with glowing cheek,\r\n      To meet the romping ripples as they played.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe longest of Mr. Goodrich's poems is \"The Outcast.\" It was first\r\npublished many years ago, and it appears now with the improvements\r\nsuggested by reflection and criticism. Its fault is, a certain\r\n_intensity_, but it has noble passages, betraying a careful study and\r\nprofound appreciation of the subtler operations of the mind,\r\nparticularly, when, in its most excited action, it is influenced by the\r\nobservation of nature.\r\n\r\nThe volume will take its place in the cabinets of our choice literature,\r\nand will be prized the more for the fact that by selecting American\r\nthemes for his most elaborate compositions, Mr. Goodrich has made\r\nliterature subservient to the purposes of patriotism.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] _Poems: by S.

KIMBALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author of \"_St. Leger_\" was by that admirable work placed in the\r\nleading rank of the new generation of American writers. The appearance\r\nin the _Knickerbocker_ for the present month, of the commencement of a\r\nsequel to \"St. Leger,\" makes it a fit occasion for some notice of his\r\nlife and genius.\r\n\r\nMr. Kimball is by inheritance of the first class of New-England men,\r\nnumbering in his family a signer of the Declaration of Independence, a\r\nPresident of the Continental Congress, and several other persons\r\nhonorably distinguished in affairs. He is a native of Lebanon, in New\r\nHampshire, where his father is still living--the centre of a circle\r\nbound to him by their respect for every public and private virtue.\r\nThough he had completed his preparatory studies before he was eleven\r\nyears of age, he did not enter college until he was nearly thirteen.\r\nFour years after, in 1834, he graduated at Dartmouth, and upon devoting\r\none year to the study of the law, he went abroad; travelled in England,\r\nScotland, and Germany; and resided some time in Paris, where he attended\r\nthe lectures of Majendie, Broussais, and Louis, in medicine, and those\r\nof the elder Dupin, and Coulanges, in law. Returning, he entered upon\r\nthe practice of the law, at Waterford, in this state, but soon removed\r\nto New-York, where a year's devotion to his profession made him familiar\r\nwith its routine. In 1842 he went a second time to Europe, renewing the\r\nassociations of his travel and student-life in Great Britain and on the\r\ncontinent. Since, for seven years, he has been an industrious and\r\nsuccessful lawyer in New-York.\r\n\r\nAlthough but few works are known to be from the pen of Mr. Kimball, he\r\nhas been a voluminous author. The vigorous and polished style of his\r\navowed compositions, is never attained but by long practice. He has\r\nbeen, we believe, a contributor to every volume of the _Knickerbocker_\r\npublished since 1842. He printed in that excellent magazine his\r\n\"Reminiscences of an Old Man,\" \"The Young Englishman,\" and the\r\nsuccessive chapters of \"St. Leger, or the Threads of Life.\" This last\r\nwork was published by Putnam, and by Bentley in London, about one year\r\nago, and it passed rapidly through two English and three American\r\neditions. It was not raised into an ephemeral popularity, as so many\r\nworks of fiction easily are, for their lightness, by careless applauses;\r\nit arrested the attention of the wisest critics; commanded their study,\r\nand received their verdict of approval as a book of learning and\r\nreflection in the anatomy of human life.\r\n\r\nMr. Kimball had been eminent in his class at college for a love of Greek\r\nliterature, and he studied the Roman also with reverent attention. It\r\nwas his distinction that he had thoroughly acquainted himself with the\r\nphilosophy of the ancients. At a later day he was attracted by the\r\nspeculation of the Germans, and a mastery of their language enabled him\r\nto enter fully into the spirit of Spinosa, Kant, and Fichte, as he did\r\ninto that of the finer intelligences, Goeethe and Richter, and pervading\r\nhe found the passion to know Whence are we? What are we? Whither do we\r\ngo? In \"St. Leger,\" a mind predisposed to superstition by some vague\r\nprophecies respecting the destiny of his family--a mind inquisitive,\r\nquick, and earnest, but subject to occasional melancholy, as the\r\ninherited spell obtains a mastery of the reason--is exposed to the\r\ninfluences of a various study, and startling experiences, all conceived\r\nwith a profound knowledge of human nature, and displayed with consummate\r\nart; having a metaphysical if not a strictly dramatic unity; and\r\nconducting by the subtlest processes, to the determination of these\r\nquestions, and the flowering of a high and genial character; as\r\nProfessor Tayler Lewis expresses it, \"at rest, deriving substantial\r\nenjoyment from the present, because satisfied with respect to the\r\nultimate, and perfect, and absolute.\"[9]\r\n\r\nAside from its qualities as a delineation of a deep inner experience,\r\n\"St. Leger\" has very great merits as a specimen of popular romantic\r\nfiction. The varied characters are admirably drawn, and are individual,\r\ndistinct, and effectively contrasted. The incidents are all shaped and\r\ncombined with remarkable skill; and, as the _Athenaeum_ observes, \"Here,\r\nthere, everywhere, the author gives evidence of passionate and romantic\r\npower.\" In some of the episodes, as in that of Wolfgang Hegewisch, for\r\nexample, in which are illustrated the tendency of a desperate philosophy\r\nand hopeless skepticism, we have that sort of mastery of the feelings,\r\nthat chaining of the intensest interest, which distinguishes the most\r\nwonderful compositions of Poe, or the German Hoffman, or Zschokke in his\r\n\"Walpurgis Night;\" and every incident in the book tends with directest\r\ncertainty to the fulfilment of its main design.\r\n\r\nThe only other work of which Mr. Kimball is the acknowledged author, is\r\n\"Cuba and the Cubans;\" a volume illustrative of the history, and social,\r\npolitical, and economical condition of the island of Cuba, written\r\nduring the excitement occasioned by its invasion from the United States,\r\nin 1849, and exhibiting a degree of research, and a judicial fairness of\r\nstatement and argument, which characterizes no other production upon\r\nthis subject. As it was generally admitted to be the most reliable,\r\ncomplete, and altogether important work, upon points commanding the\r\nattention of several nations, its circulation was very large; but it was\r\nproduced for a temporary purpose, and it will be recalled to popularity\r\nonly by a renewal of the inevitable controversies which await the\r\npolitical relations of the Antilles.\r\n\r\n\"A Story of Calais,\" in the following pages, is an example of Mr.\r\nKimball's success as a tale writer. Though less remarkable than passages\r\nin \"St. Leger,\" it will vindicate his right to a place among the chief\r\ncreators of such literature among us.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] The Inner-Life, a Review of St. Leger, by Professor Tayler Lewis,\r\nLL. D., &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BISHOP OF JAMAICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the distinguished strangers who visited the United States during\r\nthe last season, no one has left a more favorable impression upon\r\nAmerican society than the thoroughly accomplished scholar and highbred\r\ngentleman, the Bishop of Jamaica. We propose a brief sketch of his\r\nhistory:\r\n\r\nAUBREY GEORGE SPENCER, D.D. and D.C.L., was born in London on the 12th\r\nof February, 1795, and is the eldest son of the late Hon. William\r\nSpencer, the poet, whose father, Lord Charles Spencer, was a son of\r\nCharles the second Duke of Marlborough, and grandson of John Churchill,\r\nthe illustrious hero of Ramillies and Blenheim. His Christian names were\r\ngiven by the Dukes of St. Albans and Marlborough, who were his great\r\nuncles and godfathers. His mother was Susan Jennison, a countess of the\r\nHoly Roman Empire, and a lady of singular beauty and accomplishments, to\r\nwhom Mr. William Spencer was married at the court of Hesse Darmstadt, in\r\n1791. Aubrey Spencer and his younger brother George (subsequently Bishop\r\nof Madras,) received the rudiments of learning at the Abbey School of\r\nSt. Albans, whence the former was soon removed to the seminary of the\r\ncelebrated Grecian, D. Burme, of Greenwich, and the latter to the\r\nCharter house. For some time previous to his matriculation at Magdalen\r\nHall, Oxford, Mr. Aubrey Spencer was the private pupil of Mr. Mitchell,\r\nthe very learned translator of Aristophanes. At the house of his father\r\nin Curzon street, at Melbourne House in Chiswick, Blenheim, and\r\nWoolbeednig, Hallowell Hill, (the seat of the Countess Dowager Spencer,)\r\nhe was in frequent and familiar intercourse with many of the most\r\ndistinguished contemporary statesmen, philosophers, and other men of\r\nletters; and in this society his own literary and conversational talents\r\nobtained an early celebrity, and commended him to the regard and\r\nfriendship of Mr. Rogers, Mr. Campbell, Lord Byron, Mr. Hallam, Lord\r\nDudley, Mr. Coutts, Mr. Wordsworth, Mr. Francis, Mr. Homer, Thomas\r\nMoore, Mr. Southey, Lady Caroline Lamb, Mr. Crabb, and many other\r\nauthors, with some of whom he still maintains a correspondence, while\r\nsome have fallen asleep.\r\n\r\nWith the society of the county of Oxford, and with that of the\r\nUniversity, he was equally popular. In the early part of the year 1818,\r\nhe took leave of his College, on being ordained deacon, and entered on a\r\ncharge of the parish of Great Oakering, in the diocese of London. From\r\nthis, which is a very unhealthy part of Essex, he removed at the end of\r\nthe year to Bannam, Norfolk, where he became the neighbor and frequent\r\nguest of the Earl of Albemarle and the Bishop of Norwich. In March,\r\n1819, he was admitted a priest, and soon after gave up the brilliant\r\nsociety in which he had hitherto lived, and devoted himself to the\r\nChurch in the Colonies, where, for a quarter of a century, he has filled\r\na distinguished part as archdeacon and bishop.\r\n\r\nHis first visit to the Bermudas was undertaken for the recovery of his\r\nhealth, to which a colder climate has always been hostile; and when, in\r\nthe year 1825, these islands were attached to the diocese of Nova\r\nScotia, he was, at the instance of the late Primate, appointed to them\r\nas Archdeacon and Ecclesiastical Commissary to the Bishop of the see.\r\nHere he may be said to have created the Ecclesiastical Establishment\r\nwhich, under his conciliatory influence, has so rapidly and largely\r\nincreased; and with it he soon associated the revival of Bishop\r\nBerkeley's Classical Academy, and a system of general instruction, of\r\nwhich a chain of schoolhouses, from either extremity of the island, are\r\nthe abiding monuments.\r\n\r\nFrom his connection with the Bishop of Nova Scotia, the visits of\r\nArchdeacon Spencer to that colony were frequent, and many of the\r\ninhabitants both of that province and of New Brunswick retain a lively\r\nimpression of his abilities, as they were illustrated in his preaching\r\nand in the practice of the other duties of his profession and position.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1839, Dr. Spencer was consecrated by the venerable Archbishop\r\nof Canterbury, on the nomination of the crown, to the new see of\r\nNewfoundland, retaining still episcopal jurisdiction over the isles of\r\nBermuda, under the extension of the Colonial Episcopate, which relieved\r\nthe indefatigable Bishop of Nova Scotia of a large portion of his cares.\r\nThe new Bishop was enabled, by the aid of the Society for the Promotion\r\nof the Gospel in Foreign Parts, to quadruple the number of his clergy\r\nwithin four years, and to consecrate more than twenty additional\r\nchurches within the same period. A very grateful sense of the Bishop's\r\nexertions, and of the prosperous results of his unceasing labor, was\r\nmanifested in the several addresses presented to his lordship on his\r\nsubsequent translation to the diocese of Jamaica, by the clergy and\r\nlaity of Newfoundland and Bermuda.\r\n\r\nIn a paper which only purports to be a biographical notice of one who is\r\nstill living, it is not desirable to do more than briefly advert to the\r\nprincipal topics and dates of a history which may hereafter be\r\nadvantageously amplified and filled up. The real progress of the\r\nestablished church in Newfoundland at this period, would be best\r\ngathered from the Bishop's letters to the government and the religious\r\nsocieties, and to the clergy under his jurisdiction, but to these\r\ndocuments it is not likely that any biographer will have unreserved\r\naccess during the life of his lordship.\r\n\r\nOn the decease of Bishop Lipscombe, in April, 1843, Bishop Spencer was\r\ntranslated, under circumstances peculiarly indicative of the high\r\nopinion which was had of his ability by the Queen's ministers and the\r\nheads of the English church, to the see of Jamaica, one of the most\r\nimportant connected with the crown. He quitted his old diocese, as the\r\npapers of the day amply testify, with the respect of all denominations\r\nof Christians. A national ship, the Hermes, was appointed to convey him\r\nand his family and suite to Jamaica, where he arrived in the first week\r\nof November, having made the land on the auspicious festival of All\r\nSaints.\r\n\r\nThe sermon delivered by him at his installation, in the cathedral at\r\nSpanish Town, was published at the request of the Speaker of the House\r\nof Assembly, while the Earl of Elgin, the Governor-General, in his\r\nspeech to the Legislature, \"congratulated the inhabitants of Jamaica on\r\nthe appointment of a prelate of such approved talents and piety to that\r\nsee.\" At every point of the Bishop's visitation, which he commenced by a\r\nconvention of eighty clergymen, at Spanish Town, he was met by\r\ncongratulatory addresses from the vestries, and other corporate bodies,\r\ndeclaratory of their confidence in his projected measures, and of their\r\ndesire to aid him in the extension of the church. In consonance with his\r\nviews the local Legislature passed an act increasing the number of\r\nisland curates, and providing higher salaries for their support, while\r\nat the same time, they granted three thousand pounds as a first\r\ninstalment to the Church Society, which had been organized by him, and\r\nto which the Governor-General contributed the annual sum of one hundred\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nOn his visit to England in 1845 and in the beginning of 1846, he was\r\ncontinually employed in preaching in aid of various charities, and in\r\nassisting at public meetings which had for their object the promotion of\r\nChristianity by the servants of the church. At the weekly meetings of\r\nthe Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, in London, he was a\r\nconstant attendant; and the increase of the funds of that association,\r\nand the conciliation to it of many powerful supporters, are result of\r\nmeasures which may be traced to his projection and tact. In his reply to\r\nan address from the clergy, on his return from a recent visitation,\r\npublished at length in the last annual report of the parent Society for\r\nthe Propagation of the Gospel, will be found the clearest exposition of\r\nthe existing state and future prospects of the church in Jamaica; and a\r\ncharge addressed by his lordship to the clergy of the Bahamas, on the\r\nsubject of a difficult and embarrassing question, for the adjustment of\r\nwhich the Bishop received the thanks of the Queen's government and of\r\nthe local Executive, is full of valuable information on the condition,\r\nprinciples and progress of the colonial establishment. In closing the\r\nlast session of the Bahamas Legislature, Governor Gregory declared in\r\nhis speech, with reference to this matter, that he considered the\r\narrival of the Bishop in the island, at that juncture, as a convincing\r\nproof of the interposition of a special Providence in the conduct of\r\nhuman affairs.\r\n\r\nIn 1822, the Bishop was married to Eliza, the daughter of John Musson,\r\nEsq., and the sister of a former friend at the University. He has had\r\none son, now deceased, and has three daughters.\r\n\r\nAs a man of letters, Bishop Spencer is entitled to a very honorable\r\nposition. As a scholar and as a critic, he has evinced such abilities\r\nas, fitly devoted, would have secured fame; as a poet and essayist, he\r\nhas unusual grace and elegance; and a collection of the various\r\ncompositions with which he has relieved the monotony and arduous labors\r\nof his professional and official career, would vindicate his title to be\r\nclassed with those prelates who have been most eminent in the literary\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe following poems, from autographs of Bishop Spencer, we believe are\r\nfirst given to the public in the _International_.\r\n\r\n\"HE GIVETH HIS BELOVED SLEEP.\"\r\n\r\n    I tread the church-yard's path alone,\r\n    Unseen to shed the gushing tear:\r\n    I read on many a mould'ring stone\r\n    Fond records of the good and dear.\r\n    My soul is well-nigh faint with fear,\r\n    Where doubting many went to weep;\r\n    And yet what sweet repose is here--\r\n      \"He giveth His beloved sleep!\"\r\n\r\n    The world has but a feverish rest,\r\n    To weary pilgrims sometimes given,\r\n    When pleasure's cup has lost its zest,\r\n    And glory's hard-earned crown is riven.\r\n    Here, softer than the dews of even\r\n    Fall peaceful on the slumbering deep,\r\n    Asleep to earth, awake to heaven--\r\n      \"He giveth His beloved sleep.\"\r\n\r\n    Yes, on the grave's hard pillows rise\r\n    No cankering cares, no dreams of woe;\r\n    On earth we close our aching eyes,\r\n    And heavenward all our visions grow.\r\n    The airs of Eden round us flow,\r\n    And in their balm our slumbers steep.\r\n    God calls His chosen home, and so\r\n      \"He giveth His beloved sleep.\"\r\n\r\n    Ah! vainly could the human voice,\r\n    In this dull world of sin and folly,\r\n    Tell how the sainted dead rejoice\r\n    In those high realms where joy is holy--\r\n    Where no dim shade of melancholy\r\n    Beclouds the rest which angels keep,\r\n    Where, peace and bliss united wholly\r\n      \"He giveth His beloved sleep.\"\r\n\r\n    If on that brow so fair, so young,\r\n    Affliction trace an early furrow,\r\n    If Hope's too dear, delusive tongue\r\n    Has broke its promise of to-morrow,\r\n    Seek not the world again, to borrow\r\n    The deathful print its votaries reap.\r\n    Man gives his loved ones pain and sorrow,\r\n      God \"giveth His beloved sleep.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLINES WRITTEN ON WITNESSING A CONFIRMATION, IN BERMUDA, IN 1826.\r\n\r\n    Veil'd in robes of snowy whiteness,\r\n      Filled with love and sacred fear,\r\n    Forms of beauty, eyes of brightness,\r\n      At the altar's foot appear.\r\n\r\n    There with hearts oppressed with feeling\r\n      What their dying Saviour felt;\r\n    At His throne of mercy kneeling\r\n      Where their pious parents knelt,\r\n\r\n    Many a youth, and many a maiden\r\n      Meekly and devoutly bow,\r\n    And from worldly cares unladen\r\n      Ratify a Christian's vow.\r\n\r\n    Hark!

The\r\nformation of an English Etymological Dictionary is one of those works;\r\nothers might be mentioned; and in this way literature might gain much by\r\nreceiving national encouragement; _but Government would gain a great\r\ndeal more by bestowing it. Revolutionary governments understand this: I\r\nshould be glad if I could believe that our legitimate one would learn it\r\nbefore it is too late. I am addressing one who is a statesman as well as\r\na man of letters, and who is well aware that the time is come in which\r\ngovernments can no more stand without pens to support them than without\r\nbayonets._ They must soon know, if they do not already know it, that the\r\nvolunteers as well as the mercenaries of both professions, who are not\r\nalready enlisted in this service, will enlist themselves against it; and\r\nI am afraid they have a better hold upon the soldier than upon the\r\npenman; because the former has, in the spirit of his profession and in\r\nthe sense of military honor, something which not unfrequently supplies\r\nthe want of any higher principle; and I know not that any substitute is\r\nto be found among the gentlemen of the press.\r\n\r\n\"But neediness, my Lord, makes men dangerous members of society, quite\r\nas often as affluence makes them worthless ones. I am of opinion that\r\nmany persons who become bad subjects because they are necessitous,\r\nbecause 'the world is not their friend, nor the world's law,' might be\r\nkept virtuous (or, at least, withheld from mischief) by being made\r\nhappy, by early encouragement, by holding out to them a reasonable hope\r\nof obtaining, in good time, an honorable station and a competent income,\r\nas the reward of literary pursuits, when followed with ability and\r\ndiligence, and recommended by good conduct.\r\n\r\n\"My Lord, you are now on the Conservative side. Minor differences of\r\nopinion are infinitely insignificant at this time, when in truth there\r\nare but two parties in this kingdom--the Revolutionists and the\r\nLoyalists; those who would destroy the constitution, and those who would\r\ndefend it, I can have no predilections for the present administration;\r\nthey have raised the devil who is now raging through the land: but, in\r\ntheir present position, it is their business to lay him if they can; and\r\nso far as their measures may be directed to that end, I heartily say,\r\nGod speed them! _If schemes like yours for the encouragement of letters,\r\nhave never entered into their wishes, there can be no place for them at\r\npresent in their intentions._ Government can have no leisure now for\r\nattending to any thing but its own and our preservation; and the time\r\nseems not far distant when the cares of war and expenditure will come\r\nupon it once more with their all-engrossing importance. But when better\r\ntimes shall arrive (whoever may live to see them), it will be worthy the\r\nconsideration of any government whether the institution of an Academy,\r\nwith salaries for its members (in the nature of literary or lay\r\nbenefices), might not be the means of retaining in _its_ interests, as\r\nconnected with their own, a certain number of influential men of\r\nletters, who should hold those benefices, and a much greater number of\r\naspirants who would look to them in their turn. A yearly grant of ten\r\nthousand pounds would endow ten such appointments of five hundred pounds\r\neach for the elder class, and twenty-five of two hundred pounds each for\r\nyounger men; the latter eligible, of course, and preferably, but not\r\nnecessarily, to be elected to the higher benefices, as those fell\r\nvacant, and as they should have improved themselves.\r\n\r\n\"The good proposed by this, as a political measure, is not that of\r\nretaining such persons to act as pamphleteers and journalists, but that\r\nof preventing them from becoming such, in hostility to the established\r\norder of things; and of giving men of letters, as a class, something to\r\nlook for beyond the precarious gains of literature; thereby inducing in\r\nthem a desire to support the existing institutions of their country, on\r\nthe stability of which their own welfare would depend.\r\n\r\n\"Your Lordship's second question,--in what way the encouragement of\r\nGovernment could most safely and beneficially be given,--is, in the\r\nmain, answered by what has been said upon the first. I do not enter into\r\nany details of the proposed institution, for that would be to think of\r\nfitting up a castle in the air. Nor is it worth while to examine how far\r\nsuch an institution might be perverted. Abuses there would be, as in the\r\ndisposal of all preferments, civil, military, or ecclesiastical; but\r\nthere would be a more obvious check upon them; and where they occurred\r\nthey would be less injurious in their consequences than they are in the\r\nstate, the army and navy, or the church.\r\n\r\n\"With regard to prizes, methinks they are better left to schools and\r\ncolleges. Honors are worth something to scientific men, because they are\r\nconferred upon such men in other countries; at home there are precedents\r\nfor them in Newton and Davy, and the physicians and surgeons have them.\r\nIn my judgment, men of letters are better without them, unless they are\r\nrich enough to bequeath to their family a good estate with the bloody\r\nhand, and sufficiently men of the world to think such distinctions\r\nappropriate. For myself, if we had a Guelphic order, I should choose to\r\nremain a Ghibelline.\r\n\r\n\"I have written thus fully and frankly, not dreaming that your proposal\r\nis likely to be matured and carried into effect, but in the spirit of\r\ngood will, and as addressing one by whom there is no danger that I can\r\nbe misunderstood. _One thing alone I ask from the legislature, and in\r\nthe name of justice,--that the injurious law of copyright should be\r\nrepealed, and that the family of an author should not be deprived of\r\ntheir just and natural rights in his works when his permanent reputation\r\nis established._ This I ask with the earnestness of a man who is\r\nconscious that he has labored for posterity.\"\r\n\r\nThe publication of this letter, and of the correspondence between\r\nSouthey and Sir Robert Peel, in which the poet declines being knighted,\r\non account of his poverty--a correspondence eminently honorable to the\r\nlate Prime Minister, has occasioned an eloquent letter from Walter\r\nSavage Landor to Lord Brougham on the same subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSICAL NOVELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Edinburgh Review_ rebukes the daring of those uneducated\r\nstory-tellers who profane by their intrusion the holy lands, the sacred\r\nnames, and golden ages of art. We have acceptable specimens of the\r\n\"classical novel\" by Dr. Croly, Lockhart, Bulwer, and Collins (the\r\nauthor of \"Antonini\"), and in this country by Mrs. Child and William\r\nWare; but nineteen of every twenty who have attempted such compositions\r\nhave failed entirely. The Edinburgh Reviewer, after showing that the\r\nwriters whom he arraigns have merely parodied the exterior life of our\r\nown time, proceeds--\r\n\r\n\"It is not uncommon to excuse such deviations from historical propriety\r\nby saying, that if the mere accidents have been neglected, the essential\r\nhumanity has been only more fully realized: and those who quarrel with\r\nthe neglect are stigmatized as pedants having no eyes except for the\r\nexternal. We think, however, that it will be found, in most cases where\r\nthe plea is set up, that the humanity for which the sacrifice has been\r\nmade is equally external with that which has been disregarded, and much\r\nmore commonplace and conventional; being in fact, only the outer life of\r\nexisting society. We are met, of course, by the triumphant answer that\r\nShakspeare wrote Roman plays with a very slender knowledge of the\r\nclassics. It would be sufficient to reply, that we are speaking of cases\r\nwhere ignorance of antiquity is not counterbalanced by any very\r\nexuberant or profound knowledge of human nature. Possibly posterity may\r\nhave to deal with another myriad-minded dramatist whose poverty is\r\nbetter than other men's riches; but it must not be rashly presumed that\r\nhe is likely to appear at all; or, if at all, with the same deficiency\r\nof learning which was not unnatural three hundred years back. Meanwhile,\r\nit is a perverse and pernicious paradox to maintain that Shakspeare's\r\nconsummate genius was in any way connected with his 'little Latin and\r\nless Greek,' or that he might not have portrayed the Romans yet more\r\nsuccessfully if he had known more about them. Believing this, we are not\r\npresuming, as the same absurd reasoning would have it, to set up\r\nourselves against him. We do not say that any other man in his age or\r\nour own, however great his command of learning, could possibly mend\r\nthose plays by touching them; but we say that Shakspeare himself, with\r\nincreased knowledge, might have made them yet more perfect. It is easy\r\nto oppose inspiration to scholastic culture; to coin antitheses between\r\nnature and art; and to say that Shakspeare's Romans are more ideally\r\ntrue than Niebuhr's. There is some truth in all this; but it is not to\r\nthe purpose. A poet like Burns may have really known more of classical\r\nlife than a critic like Blair; nay, it may be that if Keats or Tennyson\r\nhad been a senior medallist at Cambridge, they would not have produced\r\nany thing not only so beautiful but so purely Greek as _Endymion_ or\r\n_Oenone_. In what we were just saying we were thinking of the very\r\nhighest minds. And, when we recollect how gracefully Milton could walk\r\nunder the weight of his immense learning, we need not fear that the\r\nAlantean shoulders of Shakspeare would have been oppressed by a similar\r\nload. The knowledge of antiquity may operate on the recipient so as to\r\nproduce mere bookishness and intellectual sophistication; but in itself\r\nit is a real and legitimate part of all knowledge, a portion of that\r\ntruth with which poets are conversant, a lesson set in other schools\r\nthan those where man is teacher. We know not what were Shakspeare's\r\nfeelings with respect to his own deficiencies; but we cannot believe\r\nthat the same modesty which besought his friend to chide with Fortune,\r\n'the guilty goddess of his harmful deeds,' would have shrunk from\r\nconfessing want of knowledge as an evil to be lamented, at the same time\r\nthat it was imputed to want of opportunity. If he was self-centred, it\r\nwas in his strength, not in his weakness. His eulogists may show the\r\ngreatness of their faith in him by doubting whether he could have\r\nassimilated the learning which obstructs Ben Jonson's _Catiline_ and\r\n_Sejanus_; but we have no proofs that he thought so meanly of himself or\r\nof that which he happened not to possess. On the contrary, it may be\r\nargued, from the diligent use which he has made of such information as\r\nhe had, that he would gladly have taken advantage of more. Arnold, in\r\nhis Roman History, has noted the poet's perception of historical truth\r\nin a matter where it might well have been overlooked; and future critics\r\nmay perhaps spend their time more profitably in discovering other\r\nindications of a like vigilant industry than in laboring to prove that\r\nthe absence of so servile a virtue has been conducive to his preeminence\r\nas a creative artist.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSLIDING SCALE OF THE INCONSOLABLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe editor of _The Albion_ thus christens, while he translates, the\r\nfollowing lively narrative, culled from the varied columns of the\r\n_Courrier des Etats Unis_. The malicious writer dates from Paris; but\r\nfor such experiences our own city would probably be quite as prolific a\r\nhunting-field.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHow rapid is the progress of oblivion with respect to those who are no\r\nmore! How many a quadrille shall we see this winter, exclusively made up\r\nfrom the ranks of inconsolable widows! Widows of this order exist only\r\nin the literature of the tombstone. In the world, and after the lapse of\r\na certain period, there is but one sort of widows inconsolable--those\r\nwho refuse to be comforted, because they can't get married again!\r\n\r\nOne of our most distinguished sculptors was summoned, a short time\r\nsince, to the house of a young lady, connected by birth with a family of\r\nthe highest grade in the aristocracy of wealth, and united in marriage\r\nto the heir of a title illustrious in the military annals of the empire.\r\nThe union, formed under the happiest auspices, had been, alas! of short\r\nduration. Death, unpitying death, had ruptured it, by prematurely\r\ncarrying off the young husband. The sculptor was summoned by the widow.\r\nHe traversed the apartments, silent and deserted, until he was\r\nintroduced into a bedroom, and found himself in presence of a lady,\r\nyoung and beautiful, but habited in the deepest mourning, and with a\r\nface furrowed by tears. \"You are aware,\" said she, with a painful\r\neffort, and a voice half choked by sobs, \"you are aware of the blow\r\nwhich I have received?\" The artist bowed, with an air of respectful\r\ncondolence. \"Sir,\" continued the widow, \"I am anxious to have a funeral\r\nmonument erected in honor of the husband whom I have lost.\" The artist\r\nbowed again. \"I wish that the monument should be superb, worthy of the\r\nman whose loss I weep, proportioned to the unending grief into which his\r\nloss has plunged me. I care not what it costs. I am rich, and I will\r\nwillingly sacrifice all my fortune to do honor to the memory of an\r\nadored husband. I must have a temple--with columns--in marble--and in\r\nthe middle--on a pedestal--his statue.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do my best to fulfil your wishes, madam,\" replied the artist;\r\n\"but I had not the honor of acquaintance with the deceased, and a\r\nlikeness of him is indispensable for the due execution of my work.\r\nWithout doubt, you have his portrait?\"\r\n\r\nThe widow raised her arm and pointed despairingly to a splendid likeness\r\npainted by Amaury Duval.\r\n\r\n\"A most admirable picture!\" observed the artist, \"and the painter's name\r\nis a sufficient guarantee for its striking resemblance to the original.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those are his very features, sir; it is himself. It wants but life. Ah!\r\nwould that I could restore it to him at the cost of all my blood!\"\r\n\r\n\"I will have this portrait carried to my studio, madam, and I promise\r\nyou that the marble shall reproduce it exactly.\"\r\n\r\nThe widow, at these words, sprung up, and at a single bound throwing\r\nherself towards the picture, with arms stretched out as though to defend\r\nit, exclaimed, \"Take away this portrait! carry off my only consolation!\r\nmy sole remaining comfort! never! never!\"\r\n\r\n\"But madam, you will only be deprived of it for a short time, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Not an hour! not a minute! could I exist without his beloved image!\r\nLook you, sir, I have had it placed here, in my own room, that my eyes\r\nmight be fastened upon it, without ceasing, and through my tears. His\r\nportrait shall never leave this spot one single instant, and in\r\ncontemplating _that_ will I pass the remainder of a miserable and\r\nsorrowful existence.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case, madam, you will be compelled to permit me to take a copy\r\nof it. But do not be uneasy--I shall not have occasion to trouble your\r\nsolitude for any length of time: one sketch--one sitting will suffice.\"\r\n\r\nThe widow agreed to this arrangement; she only insisted that the artist\r\nshould come back the following day. She wanted him to set to work on the\r\ninstant, so great was her longing to see the mausoleum erected. The\r\nsculptor, however, remarked that he had another work to finish first.\r\nThis difficulty she sought to overcome by means of money.\r\n\r\n\"Impossible!\" replied the artist, \"I have given my word; but do not\r\ndistress yourself; I will apply to it so diligently, that the monument\r\nshall be finished in as short a time as any other sculptor would\r\nrequire, who could apply himself to it forthwith.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see my distress,\" said the widow; \"you can make allowance for my\r\nimpatience. Be speedy, then, and above all, be lavish of magnificence.\r\nSpare no expense; only let me have a masterpiece.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral letters echoed these injunctions, during the few days\r\nimmediately following the interview. At the expiration of three months\r\nthe artist called again. He found the widow still in weeds, but a little\r\nless pallid, and a little more coquettishly dressed in her mourning\r\ngarb. \"Madam,\" said he, \"I am entirely at your service.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! at last; this is fortunate,\" replied the widow, with a gracious\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"I have made my design, but I still want one sitting for the likeness.\r\nWill you permit me to go into your bedroom?\"\r\n\r\n\"Into my bedroom? For what?\"\r\n\r\n\"To look at the portrait again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! yes; have the goodness to walk into the drawing-room; you will find\r\nit there, now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; it hangs better there; it is better lighted in the drawing-room\r\nthan in my own room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you like, madam, to look at the design for the monument?\"\r\n\r\n\"With pleasure. Oh! what a size! What profusion of decorations! Why, it\r\nis a palace, sir, this tomb!\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you not tell me, madam, that nothing could be too magnificent? I\r\nhave not considered the expense; and, by the way, here is a memorandum\r\nof what the monument will cost you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, heavens!\" exclaimed the widow, after having cast an eye over the\r\ntotal adding up. \"Why, this is enormous!\"\r\n\r\n\"You begged me to spare no expense.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, no doubt, I desire to do things properly, but not exactly to make\r\na fool of myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"This, at present, you see, is only a design; and there is time yet to\r\ncut it down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, suppose we were to leave out the temple, and the columns,\r\nand all the architectural part, and content ourselves with the statue?\r\nIt seems to me that this would be very appropriate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly it would.\"\r\n\r\n\"So let it be, then--just the statue, alone.\"\r\n\r\nShortly after this second visit, the sculptor fell desperately ill. He\r\nwas compelled to give up work; but, on returning from a tour in Italy,\r\nprescribed by his physician, he presented himself once more before the\r\nwidow, who was then in the tenth month of her mourning. He found, this\r\ntime, a few roses among the cypress, and some smiling colors playing\r\nover half-shaded grounds. He brought with him a little model of his\r\nstatue, done in plaster, and offering in miniature the idea of what his\r\nwork was to be. \"What do you think of the likeness?\" he inquired of the\r\nwidow.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me a little flattered; my husband was all very well, no\r\ndoubt; but you are making him an Apollo!\"\r\n\r\n\"Really? well, then, I can correct my work by the portrait.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't take the trouble--a little more, or a little less like, what does\r\nit matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, but I am particular about likenesses.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you absolutely must--\"\r\n\r\n\"It is in the drawing-room, yonder, is it not? I'll go in there.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not there any longer,\" replied the widow, ringing the bell.\r\n\r\n\"Baptiste,\" said she to the servant who came in, \"bring down the\r\nportrait of your master.\"\r\n\r\n\"The portrait that you sent up to the garret last week, madam?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the door opened, and a young man of distinguished air\r\nentered; his manners were easy and familiar; he kissed the fair widow's\r\nhand, and tenderly inquired after her health. \"Who in the world is this\r\ngood man in plaster?\" asked he, pointing with his finger to the\r\nstatuette, which the artist had placed upon the mantel-piece.\r\n\r\n\"It is the model of a statue for my husband's tomb.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are having a statue of him made? The devil! It's very majestic!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is only great men who are thus cut out of marble, and at full\r\nlength; it seems to me, too, that the deceased was a very ordinary\r\npersonage.\"\r\n\r\n\"In fact, his bust would be sufficient.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as you please, madam,\" said the sculptor.\r\n\r\n\"Well, let it be a bust, then; that's determined!\"\r\n\r\nTwo months later, the artist, carrying home the bust, encountered on the\r\nstairs a merry party. The widow, giving her hand to the elegant dandy\r\nwho had caused the statue of the deceased to be cut down, was on her way\r\nto the mayor's office, where she was about to take a second oath of\r\nconjugal fidelity. If the bust had not been completed, it would\r\nwillingly have been dispensed with. When, some time later, the artist\r\ncalled for his money, there was an outcry about the price; and it\r\nrequired very little less than a threat of legal proceedings, before the\r\nwidow, consoled and remarried, concluded by resigning herself to pay for\r\nthis funeral homage, reduced as it was, to the memory of her departed\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW SERIES OF TALES BY MISS MARTINEAU.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely in English literature a collection of tales by a\r\nsimple writer that are better adapted for the instruction of the masses,\r\nthan HARRIET MARTINEAU'S _Illustrations of Political Economy_. Without\r\nbelieving her a very profound philosopher, we are inclined to think\r\nthese works could be remembered longer than any of her other writings.\r\nThe pleasure and instruction we derived from them were recalled by the\r\nannouncement in the London _Leader_ that she is to contribute a new\r\nseries of stories for the people, to that journal. We copy the first of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLD GOVERNESS.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was come when the Morells must go on board. They were\r\ngoing to Canada at last, after having talked about it for several years.\r\nThere were so many children, that it was with much difficulty they had\r\ngot on for some years past; and there was no prospect for the lads at\r\nhome. They had, with extreme difficulty, paid their way: and they had,\r\nto a certain extent, educated the children. That, however, was Miss\r\nSmith's doing.\r\n\r\n\"We shall always feel, every one of us,\" said Mrs. Morell, with tears,\r\nto the elderly homely governess, \"that we are under the deepest\r\nobligations to you. But for you, the children would have grown up\r\nwithout any education at all. And, for the greatest service you or any\r\none could possibly render us, we have never been able to give you your\r\ndue,--even as regards the mere money.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can only say again,\" replied the governess, \"that you do not look at\r\nthe whole of the case. You have given me a home, when it is no easy\r\nmatter for such as I am to earn one, with my old-womanish ways and my\r\nold-fashioned knowledge.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not hear any disparagement of your ways and your knowledge,\"\r\ninterrupted Mrs. Morell. \"They have been every thing to my children: and\r\nif you could have gone with us....\"\r\n\r\nThis, however, they all knew to be out of the question. It was not only\r\nthat Miss Smith was between fifty and sixty, too old to go so far, with\r\nlittle prospect of comfort at the end of the journey; but she was at\r\npresent disabled for much usefulness by the state of her right hand. It\r\nhad been hurt by an accident a long time before, and it did not get\r\nwell. The surgeon had always said it would be a long case; and she had\r\nno use whatever of the hand in the mean time. Yet she would not part\r\nwith the baby till the last moment. She carried him on the left arm, and\r\nstood on the wharf with him--the mother at her side--till all the rest\r\nwere on board, and Mr. Morell came for his wife. It was no grand steamer\r\nthey were going in, but a humble vessel belonging to the port, which\r\nwould carry them cheap.\r\n\r\n\"Now, my love,\" said the husband. \"Now, Miss Smith,\" taking the child\r\nfrom her. \"Words cannot tell....\"\r\n\r\nAnd if words could have told, the tongue could not have uttered them. It\r\nwas little, too, that his wife could say.\r\n\r\n\"Write to us. Be sure you write. We shall write as soon as we arrive.\r\nWrite to us.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Smith glanced at the hand. She said only one word, \"Farewell!\" but\r\nshe said it cheerfully.\r\n\r\nThe steam-tug was in a hurry, and down the river they went. She had one\r\nmore appointment to keep with them. She was to wave her handkerchief\r\nfrom the rocks by the fort; and the children were to let her try whether\r\nshe could see their little handkerchiefs. So she walked quickly over the\r\ncommon to the fort, and sat down on the beach at the top of the rocks.\r\n\r\nIt was very well that she had something to do. But the plan did not\r\naltogether answer. By the time the vessel crossed the bar it was nearly\r\ndark, and she was not quite sure, among three, which it was, and she did\r\nnot suppose the children could see her handkerchief. She waved it,\r\nhowever, according to promise. How little they knew how wet it was!\r\n\r\nThen there was the walk home. It was familiar, yet very strange. When\r\nshe was a child her parents used to bring her here, in the summer time,\r\nfor sea air and bathing. The haven and the old gray bathing houses, and\r\nthe fort, and the lighthouse, and the old priory ruins crowning the\r\nrocks, were all familiar to her; but the port had so grown up that all\r\nelse was strange. And how strange now was life to her! Her parents gone,\r\nmany years back, and her two sisters since; and now, the Morells! She\r\nhad never had any money to lose, and the retired way in which the\r\nMorells lived had prevented her knowing any body out of their house. She\r\nhad not a relation nor a friend, nor even an acquaintance, in England.\r\nThe Morells had not been uneasy about her. They left her a little money,\r\nand had so high an opinion of her that they did not doubt her being\r\nabundantly employed, whenever her hand should get well. They had lived\r\ntoo much to themselves to know that her French, learned during the war,\r\nwhen nobody in England could pronounce French, would not do in these\r\ndays, nor that her trilling, old-fashioned style of playing on the\r\npiano, which they thought so beautiful, would be laughed at now in any\r\nboarding school; and that her elegant needleworks were quite out of\r\nfashion; and that there were new ways of teaching even reading,\r\nspelling, and writing.\r\n\r\nShe knew these things, and cautioned herself against discontent with the\r\nprogress of society, because she happened to be left alone behind. She\r\nsuspected, too, that the hand would not get well. The thing that she was\r\nmost certain of was, that she must not rack her brain with fears and\r\nspeculations as to what was to become of her. Her business was to wait\r\ntill she could find something to do, or learn what she was to suffer.\r\nShe thought she had better wait here. There was no call to any other\r\nplace. This was more familiar and more pleasant to her than any\r\nother--the Morells' cottage being far away, and out of the question--and\r\nhere she could live with the utmost possible cheapness. So here she\r\nstaid.\r\n\r\nThe hand got well, as far as the pain was concerned, sooner than she had\r\nexpected. But it was in a different way from what she had expected. It\r\nwas left wholly useless. And, though the time was not long, it had\r\nwrought as time does. It had worn out her clothes; it had emptied her\r\nlittle purse. It had carried away every thing she had in the world but\r\nthe very few clothes she had on. She had been verging towards the\r\nresolution she now took for three or four weeks. She took it finally\r\nwhile sitting on the bench near the fort. It was in the dusk; for her\r\ngown, though she had done her best to mend it with her left hand, was in\r\nno condition to show by daylight. She was alone in the dusk, rather\r\nhungry and very cold. The sea was dashing surlily upon the rocks below,\r\nand there was too much mist to let any stars shine upon her. It was all\r\ndreary enough; yet she was not very miserable, for her mind was made up.\r\nShe had made up her mind to go into the work-Pouse the next day. While\r\nshe was thinking calmly about it a fife began to play a sort of jig in\r\nthe yard of the fort behind her. Her heart heaved to her throat and the\r\ntears gushed from her eyes. In this same spot, fifty years before, she\r\nhad heard what seemed to her the same fife. Her father was then sitting\r\non the grass, and she was between his knees, helping to tassel the tail\r\nof a little kite they were going to fly; and, when the merry fife had\r\nstruck up, her father had snatched up her gay Harlequin that lay within\r\nreach, and made him shake his legs and arms to the music. She heard her\r\nown laugh again now, through that long course of fifty years, and in the\r\nmidst of these tears.\r\n\r\nAll that night she pondered her purpose: and the more she considered,\r\nthe more sure she was that it was right. \"I might,\" thought she, \"get\r\nmaintained by charity, no doubt: I might call on any of the clergymen of\r\nthis place, and the rich people. Or I might walk into the shops and tell\r\nmy story, and I dare say the people would give me food and clothes. And,\r\nif it was a temporary distress, I would do so. I should think it right\r\nto ask for help, if I had any prospect of work or independence in any\r\nway. But I have none: and this, I am convinced, points out my duty.\r\nHopeless cases like mine are those which public charity--legal\r\ncharity--is intended to meet. My father little dreamed of this, to be\r\nsure; and the Morells little dream of it at this moment. But when do our\r\nparents and friends, when do we ourselves, dream of what our lot is\r\nreally to turn out? Those old notions have nothing to do, if we could\r\nbut think so, with the event. Nor has my disgust any thing to do with my\r\nduty. The plain fact is, that I am growing old--that I am nearly\r\nhelpless--that I am cold and hungry, and nearly naked--that I have no\r\nfriends within reach, and no prospect whatever. I am, therefore, an\r\nobject for public charity, and I will ask for what is my due. I am\r\nafraid of what I may find in the workhouse;--the vicious people, the\r\ndirty people, the diseased people,--and, I suppose, not one among them\r\nwho can give me any companionship whatever.\r\n\r\n\"It is dreadful; but it can't be helped. And the worse the case is about\r\nmy companions--my fellow-paupers--(for I must learn to bear the\r\nword)--the greater are the chances of my finding something to do for\r\nthem;--something which may prevent my feeling myself utterly useless in\r\nthe world. This is not being wholly without prospect, after all. I\r\nsuppose nobody ever is. If it were not so cold now, I could sleep upon\r\nmine.\"\r\n\r\nIt was too cold for sleep; and when, in the morning, she offered her old\r\nshawl in payment for her bed, assuring the poor old woman who let it\r\nthat she should not want the shawl, because she was going to have other\r\nclothes, the woman shook her head sorrowfully,--her lodger looked so wan\r\nand chilled. She had no fear that there was any thought of suicide in\r\nthe case. No one could look in Miss Smith's sensible face, and hear her\r\nsteady, cheerful voice, and suppose that she would do any thing wild or\r\nimpatient.\r\n\r\n\"Who is that woman with a book in her hand?\" inquired the visiting\r\nCommissioner, some months afterwards, of the governor of the workhouse.\r\nThe governor could only say she was a single woman of the name of Smith,\r\nwho had no use of her right hand. As to who she was, he could tell no\r\nmore than this; but his wife had sometimes mentioned her as a different\r\nsort of person from those they generally saw there. She could not only\r\nread, but she read very well: and she read a great deal aloud to the old\r\npeople, and in the infirmary. She talked unlike the rest, too. She said\r\nlittle; but her language was good, and always correct. She could not do\r\nmuch on account of her infirmity: but she was always willing to do what\r\ncould be done with one hand; and she must have been very handy when she\r\nhad the use of both.\r\n\r\n\"I should have thought her eyes had been too weak for much reading,\"\r\nobserved the Commissioner. \"Has the medical officer attended to her?\"\r\n\r\nThe governor called his wife: and the wife called a pauper woman who was\r\ntold the question. This woman said that it was not exactly a case for\r\nthe doctor. Nobody that shed so many tears could have good eyes. Ah! the\r\ngovernor might be surprised; because Smith seemed so brisk in the\r\ndaytime, and cheered the old people so much. But she made up for it at\r\nnight. Many and many a time she cried the night through.\r\n\r\n\"How do you know?\" asked the Commissioner.\r\n\r\n\"I sleep in the next bed, sir. I can't say she disturbs any body; for\r\nshe is very quiet. But if any thing keeps me awake I hear her sobbing.\r\nAnd you need but feel her pillow in the morning. It is wet almost\r\nthrough.\"\r\n\r\n\"And does that happen often?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. Many a time when she has turned her back,--gone into the\r\ninfirmary, or been reading to the old people,--I have got her pillow and\r\ndried it. And I have seen her do it herself, with a smile on her face\r\nall the time.\"\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner walked away. Before he left the place, the woman Smith\r\nwas beckoned out by the governor. She went with a beating heart, with\r\nsome wild idea in her head that the Morells had sent, that some friends\r\nhad turned up. While still in the passage, however, she said to herself\r\nthat she might as well look to see her parents risen from the dead.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner had, indeed, nothing to tell. He wanted to ask. He did\r\nask, as much as his delicacy would allow. But he learned nothing;\r\nexcept, indeed, what he ought to have considered the most important\r\nthing, the state of her mind about being there. About that, she was\r\nfrank enough. She said over again to him what she had said to herself,\r\nabout this being the right place for one in her circumstances. She\r\nconsidered that it would be an abuse of private charity for her to be\r\nmaintained in idleness at an expense which might set forward in life\r\nsome person in a less hopeless position.\r\n\r\n\"You speak cheerfully, as if you were in earnest,\" said the\r\nCommissioner.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, I am in earnest,\" she replied.\r\n\r\nAnd cheerful she remained throughout the conversation. Only once the\r\nCommissioner saw her eyes filled and a quiver on her lips. He did not\r\nknow it; but he had unconsciously called her \"Madam.\"\r\n\r\nWould she prefer the children's department of the House? There was no\r\ndoubt that she could teach them much. Would she change her quarters? No.\r\nShe was too old now for that. She should not be a good companion now for\r\nchildren; and they would be too much for her. Unless she was wanted--\r\n\r\nBy no means. She should be where she preferred to be.\r\n\r\nShe preferred to be where she was. The Commissioner's lady soon after\r\ndropped in, and managed to engage Smith in conversation. But there was\r\nno result; because Smith did not choose that there should be. Perhaps\r\nshe was more in the infirmary; and had oftener a warm seat by the fire,\r\nand was spoken to with more deference. But this might be solely owing to\r\nthe way she made with the people by her own acts and manners. The\r\ninvalids and the infirm grew so fond of her that they poured out to her\r\nall their complaints. She was favored with the knowledge of every\r\npainful sensation as it passed, and every uneasy thought as it arose.\r\n\r\n\"I never thought to die in such a place as this,\" groaned old Johnny\r\nJacks.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder at that,\" said his old wife; \"for you never took any care to\r\nprovide yourself a better--to say nothing of me.\" And she went on to\r\ntell how Johnny had idled and drank his life away, and brought her here\r\nat last. Much of Johnny's idling and drinking having been connected with\r\nelectioneering in an abominably venal city, he was a great talker on\r\npolitics, and the state was made responsible for all his troubles. He\r\nsaid it was a shame that any body should die in a workhouse; he appealed\r\nto his neighbor Smith, who was warming his broth, whether it was not so?\r\n\r\n\"Which is best?\" she answered; \"being here, or on a common, or the\r\nsea-sands? Because,\" she added, \"there was a time when old people like\r\nus were left to die wherever they fell. There are countries now where\r\nold people die so. I should not like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean to say that you or any one likes being here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; I don't mean to say that. But things are better than they were\r\nonce: and they may be better again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall not live to see that,\" groaned Johnny.\r\n\r\n\"No; nor I. But it is something to think of.\"\r\n\r\n\"D---- it,\" said Johnny, \"I am not the better for any good that does not\r\nhappen to me, nor to any body I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are not you?\" said neighbor Smith. \"Well, now, I am.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so she was to the end. She died in that infirmary, and not very long\r\nafter. When the Morells' letter came, it was plain that they had enough\r\nto do to take care of themselves. So she did not let them know,--in her\r\nreply, written by the hands of the schoolmaster,--where she was. The\r\nletter was so cheerful that they are probably far from suspecting, at\r\nthis moment, how she died and was buried. As \"from the abundance of the\r\nheart the mouth speaketh,\" there was so much in her letter as rather\r\nsurprised them about her hope and expectation that the time would come\r\nwhen hearty work in the vigorous season of life should secure its easy\r\nclose; and when a greater variety of employment should be opened to\r\nwomen. There was more of this kind of speculation and less news and\r\ndetail of facts than they would have liked. But it was a household event\r\nto have a letter from Miss Smith; and the very little children,\r\nforgetting the wide sea they had passed, began shouting for Miss Smith\r\nto come to them just (as it happened) when her ear was closing to every\r\nhuman voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE ATTEMPTS TO DISCOVER THE NORTHWEST PASSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some peculiarities of style in the following performance,\r\nwhich is by no means devoid of eloquence, and which derives a certain\r\ninterest from the efforts now being made to discover the fate of Sir\r\nJohn Franklin. The author is GEORGE STOVIN VENABLES, LL. D., of Jesus\r\nCollege, Cambridge.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NORTHWEST PASSAGE.\r\n\r\n    \"And now there came both mist and snow,\r\n    And it grew wondrous cold;\r\n    And ice, mast high, came floating by,\r\n    As green as emerald.\r\n    And through the drifts and snowy clifts\r\n    Did send a dismal sheen:\r\n    Nor shape of men, nor beasts we ken--\r\n    The ice was all between--\r\n    The ice was here, the ice was there--\r\n    The ice was all around:\r\n    It crack'd and growl'd, and roar'd and howl'd,\r\n    Like noises in a swound.\"\r\n\r\n        COLERIDGE. _Rime of the Ancient Mariner._\r\n\r\nThe secret wonders of the gloomy North bid proud defiance, in their\r\nsolitude, to man's triumphant daring. Who shall pierce the ancient\r\nprison-house where Nature's might, in mightier chains of adamantine\r\nfrost, lies fettered, since Creation? Who shall live where promontories\r\nhuge, of piled ice, like monstrous fragments of primeval worlds tossed\r\non the surge of Chaos, over the waves rear their triumphant heads, and\r\nlaugh to scorn the undreaded kinghood of the lordly sea?\r\n\r\nA fearful challenge! yet the charmed spell, which summons man to high\r\ndiscovery, is ever vocal in the outward world, though they alone may\r\nhear it, who have hearts responsive to its tone. The gale of spring,\r\nbreathing sweet balm over the western waters, called forth that gifted\r\nold adventurer[10] to seek the perfumes of spice-laden winds, far in the\r\nIndian Isles. Yea, there is power in Nature's solemn music. All have\r\nheard the sighs of Winter in the middle air, and seen the skirts of his\r\ncloud-woven robe lingering upon the misty mountain-top: but years\r\nrolled on, ere man might understand the mystic invitation of that call\r\nto seek the Monarch in his Arctic home.\r\n\r\nAt length that call is answered. Daringly yon gallant ship, towards the\r\nPolar Star, walks the untrodden pathways of old Ocean, leaving the\r\nhaunts of man. Even now, the bounds are passed where silently the Boreal\r\nMorn[11] folds and unfolds, in swiftest interchange, her silver robe of\r\nalternating light over the midnight Heaven. There is a change in every\r\nsight and sound. White glaciers clash on the tormented waves, in fierce\r\ncareer waving eternally, and hoary whales, with musical din[12] booming\r\nalong the deep, breathe forth in giant chorus, wondrously, the welcome\r\nof the Spirit of the North.\r\n\r\nJoy to the brave! That old phantasmal veil which checked the view of dim\r\nantiquity, shrinks from their eagle glance, while fabled hills and\r\nregions of impenetrable ice fade in the blue expanse of mighty\r\nbays[13]--now spread the bosom of the expectant sail unto the Eastern\r\nbreeze, and while the prow furrows the yielding waters, image forth high\r\ndreams of lofty hope--the joyous bound of billows gushing between parted\r\nshores, where Asia's rocky brow for ever frowns on the opposing\r\ncontinent. And, borne on spirit-plumed wings, let fancy soar far from\r\nthat sunless clime, to the warm South, where soft skies slumber through\r\nthe cloudless noon, o'er the gold palaces of fair Cathay.\r\n\r\nWhy pause ye in mid ocean? Still the sail swells to the voiceful breeze;\r\nthe high mast bends with hideous creak, and every separate rib in the\r\nhuge fabric quivers. Yet the ship on the unmoved waters motionless\r\nstruggles, as one, who in a feverish dream nervelessly fleeing o'er a\r\nhaunted waste, strives horribly to shun some fiendish shape, with\r\nstraining sinews, and convulsive gasp, and faint limbs, magic-stricken.\r\nThere is rest, dismal and dreary, on the silent sea: most dismal quiet:\r\nfor the viewless might of the keen frost-wind[14] crisps the curling\r\nwaves, binding their motion with a clankless chain along the far\r\nhorizon. Fruitlessly the imprisoned vessel writhes, until the gale,\r\nlulled in the embrace of evening, leaves its prey, to share the torpor\r\nof the lifeless waste, till earth awaken from her half-year's sleep.\r\n\r\nYet, in those daring hearts, the cheerless voice of boding Fear or dull\r\nDespondency can find no answering tone, whether the storm, round the\r\nsnow-rampart[15] howling, interweaves his solemn moans with the\r\nrejoicing shouts of the glad theatre,[16] or simple strains of homely\r\nmusic leave that warm recess--vibrating far into the tremulous air.\r\nHere, even here are pleasures; those stray[17] forms of joy, which\r\nNature spreads throughout the world, that he who seeks may find them.\r\nWhen the Sun, uprising from his long and gloomy trance, beams through\r\nthe clearer air, how beautiful, in some obscurest dell[18] of that lone\r\nland, led by the music of an unseen river to see fair flowers, with\r\nlight-awakened buds, salute the spring tide. Happily, they smile in the\r\nmidst of nakedness, like sweet memories of laughing infancy, beaming\r\naround the desolation of an aged heart.\r\n\r\nOh, that the might of Man's majestic will were self-sufficing! that the\r\nmeaner chains which bind him to this dark, material world, before the\r\nlightning glance of Enterprise might fade, as those Philistian bonds,\r\nthat fell from him of Zorah. Back--in sorrow back--the ocean-wanderers\r\nturn the unwilling prow; for Nature may not yield, and all is lost, save\r\ngloomy thoughts of unrequited toil in the storm-beaten deep; and\r\nphantasies of gorgeous dreams, for ever desolate; and hopes, which were,\r\nand will not be again.\r\n\r\nYet if the race of Man, as some have deemed[19], form but one mighty\r\nBeing, who doth live, yea with intenser life, while kingly Death benumbs\r\neach separate atom with the touch of his pale sceptre--one unchanging\r\nocean of everchanging waves--one deathless heaven of clouds, which to\r\ntheir graves roll ceaselessly: if it be so, not vainly have long years\r\nsent forth their heralds on the trackless deep, where high endeavors of\r\nexalted will which in themselves find no accomplishment, shall build at\r\nlength perfection. Peacefully he[20] sleeps, who erst beheld the rifted\r\nshores of Greenland \"glister in the sun, like gold:\" and that deserted\r\nchief[21] whose angry moan once mingled wildly with the screaming winds\r\nand the hoarse gurgle of ingulfing waves, is unremembered now. But high\r\nEmprise died not with them. Have not our latter days beheld, with awe,\r\nthe ice-borne Muscovite[22] ride the fierce billows of the Polar Sea?\r\nHas not the Northern hunter seen the flag of England, o'er her floating\r\npalaces, unfurled in his dominions crystalline? And who shall mourn,\r\nwhile, in the mystic race, from hand to hand still moves the unquenched\r\ntorch, that none have reached the goal? Not suddenly doth the sweet\r\nwarmth of universal life, from brumal caves advancing, interfuse the\r\nvast abysmal air, or penetrate the deep heart of the frost-entranced\r\nEarth. Gentle, and in its very gentleness invincible, it moves, though\r\nruthlessly stern Winter calls his rallied armies on, and snow-blasts\r\nviolate the joyous prime. So is it, with the silent victories of Man's\r\nenduring spirit: we have seen Winter and Spring; and shall we not behold\r\nthe full rejoicing of the complete year?\r\n\r\nThe hour shall come, nor shall the longing heart in that dark interval\r\nbe all unblest with glance prophetic. Though no meteor shape glare from\r\nthe speaking sky, no sheeted ghost wander dim-moving in the weird\r\nmidnight, with such forshadowings true as ever wait on him who, with a\r\ncalm and reverend eye, hath viewed the mysteries of things, and dared to\r\nimage forth the future from the past--bind on the mystic robe, and from\r\nthe brow of Hope's enchanted hill look boldly forth upon the coming\r\nages. Saw ye not white fog-wreaths floating through the cold gray dawn\r\nover ice-laden billows, as they roll through yon rock-cinctured chasm? A\r\ndusky shape looms through the hazy atmosphere, and sails, as of some\r\nstruggling bark that wearily breasts the opposing strength of angry\r\nwaves,[23] float with a fitful motion to and fro. Still on and on--a\r\nbreath-suspending sight of pale Solicitude, and fearful hope--and hark!\r\nthe triple crash of Britain's joy, the magical music of her wild hurra,\r\npeals with a sound of mighty exultation through the aerial depths. The\r\ncloven mist unwraps its folded canopy, and lo! the blue Pacific,\r\nboundlessly outspread, far glitters in the silvery light of morn.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] Columbus.\r\n\r\n[11] The phenomenon which is commonly called Aurora Borealis, is in high\r\nlatitudes frequently seen to the south.\r\n\r\n[12] On entering the Arctic Circle, the musical sounds of the white\r\nwhales is first heard.\r\n\r\n[13] Modern discoverers have frequently found an open passage in\r\nlatitudes, where chains of hills were laid down in the old charts.\r\n\r\n[14] The effect of the change of temperature at the beginning of winter\r\nis almost instantaneous, as young ice at the thickness of half an inch\r\nwill stop a large vessel in full sail.\r\n\r\n[15] Captain Parry found considerable advantage from raising a wall of\r\nsnow round the ship, in its winter station.\r\n\r\n[16] The theatrical amusements, which were introduced during the stay of\r\nthe Fury and Hecla at Melvile Island, are well known.\r\n\r\n[17] Alluding to the following lines of Mr. Wordsworth:--\r\n\r\n    ----\"Pleasure is spread throughout the earth,\r\n    In stray gifts, to be claim'd by whoever shall find.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[18] The beautiful effect of these Arctic Oases is described in the\r\naccount of Captain Parry's second voyage.\r\n\r\n[19] See the speech attributed by Socrates to Diotima in the Banquet of\r\nPlato.\r\n\r\n[20] Sir Martin Frobisher, who in 1577 anchored on the Western coast of\r\nGreenland, reported that in that country \"the stones be altogether\r\nsparkled, and glister in the sun like gold.\"\r\n\r\n[21] Hudson.\r\n\r\n[22] Baron Wrangle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOLLECTIONS OF PAGANINI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Leaves from the Portfolio of a Manager,\" in the December _Dublin\r\nUniversity Magazine_, disclose a number of interesting facts connected\r\nwith Prynne's \"Histriomastix,\" Milton's \"Samson Agonistes,\" Hannah\r\nMore's \"Tragedies,\" Ireland's \"Shakspeare Forgeries,\" and not a few very\r\nstartling disclosures respecting the extraordinary emoluments of first\r\nclass performers, from Roscius down to Jenny Lind. From this portion of\r\nour Manager's Portfolio we select the amusing recollections of Paganini\r\nin Ireland, twenty years ago:\r\n\r\n\"Catalani, Pasta, Sontag, Malibran, Grisi, Taglioni, Rubini, Mario,\r\nTamburini, Lablache, _cum multis aliis_, have received their thousands,\r\nand tens of thousands: but, until the Jenny Lind mania left every thing\r\nelse at an immeasurable distance, Paganini obtained larger sums than had\r\never before been received in modern times. He came with a prodigious\r\nflourish of trumpets, a vast continental reputation, and a few personal\r\nlegends of the most exciting character. It was said that he had killed\r\nhis wife in a fit of jealousy, and made fiddlestrings of her intestines;\r\nand that the devil had composed a sonata for him in a dream, as he\r\nformerly did for Tartini. When you looked at him, you thought all this,\r\nand more, very likely to be true. His talent was almost supernatural,\r\nwhile his 'get up,' and 'mise en scene,' were original and unearthly,\r\nsuch as those who saw him will never forget, and those who did not can\r\nwith difficulty conceive. The individual and his performance were\r\nequally unlike anything that had ever been exhibited before. No picture\r\nor description can convey an adequate idea of his entrance and his exit.\r\nTo walk simply on and off the stage appears a commonplace operation\r\nenough, but Paganini did this in a manner peculiar to himself, which\r\nbaffled all imitation. While I am writing of it, his first appearance in\r\nDublin, at the great Musical Festival of 1830, presents itself to 'my\r\nmind's eye,' as an event of yesterday. When he placed himself in\r\nposition to commence, the crowded audience were hushed into a deathlike\r\nsilence. His black habiliments; his pale, attenuated visage, powerfully\r\nexpressive; his long, silky, raven tresses, and the flash of his dark\r\neye, as he shook them back over his shoulders; his thin, transparent\r\nfingers, unusually long; the mode in which he grasped his bow, and the\r\ntremendous length to which he drew it; and, climax of all, his sudden\r\nmanner of placing both bow and instrument under his arm, while he threw\r\nhis hands behind him, elevated his head, his features almost distorted\r\nwith a smile of ecstasy, and his very hair instinct with life, at the\r\nconclusion of an unparalleled fantasia! And there he stood, immovable\r\nand triumphant, while the theatre rang again with peals on peals of\r\napplause, and shouts of the wildest enthusiasm! None who witnessed this\r\nwill ever forget it, nor are they likely again to see the same effect\r\nproduced by mere mortal agency.\r\n\r\n\"The _one_ string feat I always considered unworthy this great master of\r\nhis art. It has been done by fifty others, and is at best but an\r\nimperfect exhibition on a perfect instrument; a mere piece of\r\ncharlatanerie, or theatrical 'gag,' to use a professional term,\r\nsufficiently intelligible. There have been, and _are_, mighty musicians\r\non the violin. Spagnoletti, De Beriot, Ole Bull (who according to some\r\nplays without any string at all), Sivori, Joachim, Ernst, Levey, &c.\r\n&c., are all in the list of great players; but there never was more than\r\none Paganini; he is unique and unapproachable.\r\n\r\n\"In Dublin, in 1830, Paganini saved the Musical Festival, which would\r\nhave failed but for his individual attraction, although supported by an\r\narmy of talent in every department. All was done in first-rate style,\r\nnot to be surpassed. There were Braham, Madame Stockhausen, H. Phillips,\r\nDe Begnis, &c. &c., Sir G. Smart for conductor, Cramer, Mori, and T.\r\nCooke for leaders, Lindley, Nicholson, Anfossi, Lidel Hermann, Pigott,\r\nand above ninety musicians in the orchestra, and more than one hundred\r\nand twenty singers in the chorus. The festival was held in the\r\nTheatre-Royal, then, as now, the only building in Dublin capable of\r\naccommodating the vast number which alone could render such a\r\nspeculation remunerative. The theatre can hold two thousand six hundred\r\npersons, all of whom may see and hear, whether in the boxes, pit, or\r\ngalleries. The arrangement was, to have oratorios kept distinct on\r\ncertain mornings, and miscellaneous concerts on the evenings of other\r\ndays. The concerts were crushers, but the first oratorio was decidedly a\r\nbreak down. The committee became alarmed; the expenses were enormous,\r\nand heavy liabilities stared them in the face. There was no time to be\r\nlost, and at the second oratorio, duly announced, there stood Paganini,\r\nin front of the orchestra, violin in hand, on an advanced platform,\r\noverhanging the pit, not unlike orator Henley's tub, as immortalized by\r\nthe poet. Between the acts of the Messiah and the Creation, he fiddled\r\n'the Witches at the Great Walnut Tree of Benevento,' with other equally\r\nappropriate interpolations, to the ecstatic delight of applauding\r\nthousands, who cared not a pin for Hadyn or Handel, but came to hear\r\nPaganini alone; and to the no small scandal of the select few, who\r\nthought the episode a little on the north side of consistency. But the\r\nmoney was thereby forthcoming, every body was paid, the committee\r\nescaped without damage, and a hazardous speculation, undertaken by a few\r\nspirited individuals, was wound up with deserved success.\r\n\r\n\"When the festival was over, the town empty, and a cannon-ball might\r\nhave fired down Sackville-street, without doing much injury, Paganini\r\nwas engaged by himself for a series of five performances in the theatre.\r\nFor this he received L1,143. His dividend on the first night's receipts\r\namounted to L330 (_horresco referens_)! without a shilling of outlay\r\nincurred on his part. He had the lion's share with a vengeance, as the\r\nmanager cleared with difficulty L200. The terms he demanded and obtained\r\nwere a clear two-thirds of each night's receipts, twenty-five guineas\r\nper night for the services of two auxiliaries, worth about as many\r\nshillings, the full value allowed for every free ticket, and an express\r\nstipulation that if he required a rehearsal on a dark morning, when\r\nextra light might be indispensable, the expense of candles should not\r\nfall on him--a contingency which by no possible contrivance could\r\ninvolve a responsibility exceeding five or six shillings.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[23] A current is supposed to flow constantly from the Pacific through\r\nthe North-West Passage into the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PEASANT DUCHESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Stamford Mercury_ gives an interesting account of the life and\r\nfortunes of a young woman of that neighborhood who rose to a high\r\nstation by means of her personal attractions, and, after a checkered\r\nlife, died in Italy a few weeks ago. She was the daughter of John Peele,\r\na small farmer at Corringham, near Gainsborough, who eked out a somewhat\r\ndeclining livelihood by dealing in horses, &c., having previously been\r\nin better circumstances. Being an only daughter, and aware that she\r\npossessed no small share of rustic charms, she resolved to try her\r\nfortune in a higher sphere. She became a dressmaker in Gainsborough, and\r\nresided subsequently in Hull, and it is said as housemaid in a good\r\nfamily in London, where her attractions obtained for her the attentions\r\nof a person of rank, to whom she afterwards averred she was married; and\r\nshe from that time occupied a position where her fortunes led her into\r\ncontact with some of the highest classes. A few years afterwards she\r\nastonished her former companions by appearing with her carriage and\r\nlivery servants in the character of _chere amie_ to Mr. Fauntleroy, then\r\na flourishing banker in London. The riches of the banker were of a\r\ndoubtful character, however; some time afterward she was convicted of\r\nforgery, and paid the penalty with his life. Affected by the ruin, but\r\nnot participating in the crime of Fauntleroy, she struggled bravely with\r\nfate, and generally maintained a fair appearance in society both in\r\nLondon and Paris. She shortly reappeared in her native county as Duchess\r\nof Palata. At this time the fortunes of her family had reduced them to\r\nbe the occupants of a small cottage at Morton, and age rendering her\r\nfather incapable of active exertion, he filled the humble office of\r\nrural postman. To her honor it should be recorded that she enabled her\r\nparents to pass the remainder of their days in comfort. Six or seven\r\nyears ago she again visited her native place, a widow, his grace the\r\nDuke of Palata having paid the debt of nature. Her mother she left at\r\nMorton, paid the last duties to her father (somewhat ostentatiously),\r\nand volunteered her assistance to promote the advancement of her female\r\nrelatives. Again, however, \"a change came o'er the spirit of her dream;\"\r\nand some three or four years ago the public journals announced her\r\nmarriage to the son of an Irish clergyman of good family. In this\r\ncharacter, accompanied by her niece as _femme de chambre_, but not by\r\nher husband, she once more visited Gainsborough and the scenes of her\r\nyouth; after making her mother an allowance, she again departed for\r\nItaly, in good health; but death, which spares neither rank nor\r\ncharacter, has closed the \"last scene of all, in this strange eventful\r\nhistory.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe author of the \"Nibelungenlied\" is unknown, and, whether it be the\r\nwork of one poet, of two, or twenty, is still a matter of doubt, among\r\nGerman critics. That the Nibelungenlied has been extensively\r\ninterpolated, is, I believe, agreed on all hands; we may conclude as\r\nmuch, from having reason to believe that it was handed down for some\r\ntime (how long, nobody knows for certain), by oral tradition, and what\r\neffect such a state of things may have on popular poetry, we may readily\r\ncollect from what Bishop Percy and Sir Walter Scott have told us of the\r\nvariations in the old ballads of England and Scotland. Lachmann\r\nattributes it to the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Correspondence.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PARIS, DEC. 2, 1850.\r\n\r\nFROM time immemorial, no one knows why (for the legends which recount\r\nher history leave it doubtful whether she performed on any instrument),\r\nSt. Cecilia has been chosen by musicians as their patron saint; and the\r\nmusicians of Paris, on the approach of winter, always celebrate a mass,\r\nin music, to her honor, and for the benefit of the distressed members of\r\ntheir body. Not that they entertain any exaggerated idea of the\r\nconsoling powers of the musical art, or hope to relieve the positive\r\nsufferings of poverty and destitution by any combination of sounds, no\r\nmatter how harmonious; but this festival being held in the church of St.\r\nEustache, the largest in Paris, and all lovers of music being so eager\r\nto gain admission, that the immense aisles of this grand old pile (which\r\nwill contain five thousand persons), are always crowded to overflowing\r\non these occasions, every one paying a franc for his admission: the sum\r\nthus gained, together with the collections taken up in the middle of the\r\nservice, by the committee of ladies chosen for that purpose (who go\r\nround among the crowd, preceded by the beadle, and followed by two or\r\nthree attendant gentlemen, carrying a little embroidered bag of a\r\nparticular shape, used for that purpose, in which they receive the\r\ncontributions of the benevolent), constitute a fund, from which many an\r\nunfortunate or superannuated brother of the tuneful craft obtains\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nThis vast building, with its lofty arches, is admirably calculated for\r\nthe performance of grand religious compositions; the effect of the music\r\nbeing enhanced by the aspect of the building, and the accessories of\r\nsculpture, painting, and carving, which render this church one of the\r\nrichest in the capital.\r\n\r\nTo obtain places on any occasion of the kind, it is necessary to go an\r\nhour or two in advance; and the gradual filling of the aisles is one of\r\nthe most curious scenes which a stranger can contemplate. As there are\r\nno pews, each person, on entering, helps himself or herself to a chair,\r\nwhich he holds aloft over the heads of his already seated neighbors, as\r\nhe slowly forces his way onward through their serried ranks, until he\r\nespies some unappropriated gap into which he can insinuate his chair and\r\nhimself; the police and the beadles always taking care to keep a little\r\npathway, just large enough to squeeze through, open all through the\r\nouter aisle that runs round the church. For the unfortunate people who\r\nform the walls of this pathway, the process of filling is a severe\r\ninfliction; the uninterrupted stream of in-comers, forcing their way\r\nalong with a ruthless disregard of the shoulders of those between whom\r\nthey pass, is really, (especially when the in-comer happens to be a very\r\nstout man, or a very fat lady, enveloped in an unusual quantity of\r\ndrapery,) almost overpowering. Every now and then the beadle comes\r\nalong, rapping his silver-headed cane on the pavement, and crying, \"Way,\r\nthere! keep out of the path!\" and escorting a party of privileged\r\nindividuals for whom seats have been reserved; and, as the beadle is\r\nalways tall and stout, and always forces his way through in defiance of\r\napparent impossibilities, a chorus of murmurs accompanies his progress.\r\nThe beadle is a very grand personage, and his appearance sufficiently\r\nindicates this fact. He wears a cocked hat, covered with silver lace,\r\nand decorated with nodding white plumes; a scarf of crimson velvet,\r\nstiff with embroidery in silver thread, covers the upper part of his\r\nperson; black velvet smalls, fastened at the knee with silver buckles,\r\nwhite silk stockings and gloves, and enormous buckles in his polished\r\nshoes, complete his attire. He wears a massive silver chain round his\r\nneck; and a sword hangs at his side to strike terror into the hearts of\r\nall beholders. Besides the grand beadle, there are several minor ones,\r\ndressed in black, but wearing heavy silver chains; _gens d'armes_ also\r\nare always present, and often soldiers, who mount guard, musket in hand,\r\nat all the doorways, and on the steps of the chancel.\r\n\r\nWhen these sapient guardians of the peace perceive that as many have\r\nbeen admitted as can possibly be squeezed into the building, they shut\r\nthe doors; and the process of distribution goes on until the mass is\r\nequalized throughout the edifice; a task of no small difficulty, as the\r\nportions of the building contiguous to the doors are always densely\r\npacked at an early period, so that the greater number have to pass\r\nthrough these crowded centres to gain the remoter parts of the church.\r\nMeantime people chat, and look about them, amusing themselves as they\r\nbest can; and the sonorous edifice echoes with the footsteps of the\r\nmoving mass. But at length the noise subsides; the \"organ utters its\r\nvoices,\" and a hush, intense, unbroken, falls on the vast assembly. The\r\nglorious music peals through the vaulted aisles, and swells upward to\r\nthe arching roof, pervading every nook and corner of the fane; and so\r\nperfect is the stillness that one would think the winged notes the only\r\nliving things within its precincts.\r\n\r\nOn Friday last this annual solemnity was celebrated as usual at St.\r\nEustache; the mass, composed by Adam, a very noble and beautiful\r\ncomposition, was admirably executed by a choir of two hundred and fifty\r\nsingers, and a band of one hundred musicians, including the whole\r\norchestra of the _Opera Comique_, and the best performers from the\r\nItalian opera. The solos were sung by Mesdames Grimm and Couraud, and by\r\nBassine and Chapuis, the latter being one of the best tenors in the\r\ncity. Some of the quartettes, with accompaniments of harps and wind\r\ninstruments, were indescribably beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop of Paris made an elegant little address, in which he\r\nspoke of art in Pagan and in Christian days, and of its mission in the\r\npresent; and winding up with an appeal to the liberality of his hearers\r\non behalf of the charitable idea which had prompted this performance.\r\nThe Archbishop is a man of mild and grave countenance, but his dress was\r\nvery inharmonious. He wore a surplice of very rich lace, a cape of\r\nviolet silk, and a scarf richly embroidered in gold, which was all very\r\npretty, but his arms and hands were encased in sleeves, finished with\r\ngloves, of scarlet cloth, which showed through the lace sleeves of the\r\nsurplice, and gave the hands a very frightful appearance. He wore a\r\nlittle round cap on the top of his head, a golden crucifix on his bosom,\r\nand an enormous gold ring on his right hand. He spoke very slowly,\r\nscreaming rather than speaking, in order to make himself heard in the\r\ndistant parts of the building. The service lasted two hours, and yielded\r\nseveral thousand francs.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess of Narbonne, famed for her benevolence, was so desirous to\r\naid on this occasion, that though unable, on account of her great age,\r\nto go among the crowd _making the guest_, as it is termed, she held a\r\nbag at one of the great doors, adding to the sum she thus received, a\r\nthousand francs as her own contribution, and a hundred francs for her\r\nchair, for which the ordinary price is two sous.\r\n\r\nThe musicians are not alone in their preparations for winter. The\r\nshopkeepers are just beginning the periodic display which betokens the\r\ncoming on of the holidays: and conspicuous among the novelties whose\r\nappearance thus indicate the approach of Christmas, is a new style of\r\nporcelain, of English invention, which imitates with great success the\r\nantique marble vases, pitchers, &c., of classic days. Many of these\r\nobjects are of great beauty; the creamy hue of the ware itself, slightly\r\ntranslucent, the graceful simplicity of their forms, and the delicate\r\nmouldings of classical designs in bass-relief with which they are\r\nadorned, producing an admirable effect, highly creditable to English\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nWhile modern art is thus successfully emulating the symmetrical\r\nachievements of ancient times, a relic of great interest, recalling the\r\nromantic age of Spanish history, has just been unexpectedly brought to\r\nlight. Some workmen, employed in making repairs in the Guildhall of\r\nBurgos, in Spain, have recently discovered the tomb of the Cid, so\r\nrenowned in ancient story; a tomb whose very existence was unknown. An\r\nold chest, long considered as mere rubbish, and on which stood the\r\nantique chair from which, in other days, the Counts of Castille gave\r\njudgment, having been opened through the curiosity of these workmen, was\r\nfound to contain the remains of Don Rodrigo Campeador, and his wife\r\nChimena, immortalized in ancient legend, in the verses of Guilhen de\r\nCastro, of Corneille, and in our own days, in the graceful writings of\r\nMrs. Hemans. The remains of the renowned hero and his beautiful spouse\r\nare to be removed to the church of San Gadeo, where a suitable monument\r\nwill be erected to their memory.\r\n\r\nThe following incident, connected with the two prevailing manias of the\r\nday, lapdogs and balloon-ascensions, is just now amusing the gay circles\r\nof this gossiping capital.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Madame de N., the accomplished and beautiful wife of a\r\ntriple millionaire of the quartier St. Honore, equally renowned for the\r\ncharms of her wit, and for the intensity of her passion for the barking\r\npets so dear to Parisian hearts, had taken a violent fancy (shared by\r\nhalf Paris) to a certain tiny gray spaniel, the property of one of the\r\nmost admired of the innumerable representatives of Albion at this time\r\nhere congregated, the beautiful and distinguished Lady R., whose\r\nintimacy was assiduously cultivated by Madame de N., all for the love of\r\nthe little gray spaniel.\r\n\r\nSylphide, the spaniel in question, was in sooth well calculated to make\r\nhavoc in hearts susceptible to canine charms. Her glossy fur, combed,\r\nbathed, and perfumed every day with the utmost care, was of the most\r\ndelicate mouse-color, and softer than silk; her lustrous eyes sparkled\r\nlike jewels, and her expressive face, with the delicate drooping ears\r\nthat adorned her graceful head, were the realization of the most ideal\r\ndream of little-doggish beauty; her tail was perfection; her slender\r\nlegs, in their light electric movements, hardly touched the ground; and\r\nthe dainty way in which she raised her charming little paws from the\r\nsidewalk, when, by some rare chance (attired in her newest paletot of\r\nthe finest merino, lined with wadded silk, and trimmed with a rich\r\nbraid, her neck encircled with a silver collar, whose burnished chain\r\nwas attached to her mistress's waist), she honored the sidewalk with\r\ntheir pressure, was so irresistibly bewitching, that all the fair round\r\narms of Paris opened spontaneously at the sight, as though to offer a\r\nnestling-place to the little beauty, and raise her from a contact\r\nunworthy of so peerless a creature.\r\n\r\nAny price, no matter how exorbitant, that could have been asked for this\r\nlittle paragon, Madame de N. would very gladly have paid; but,\r\nunhappily, Sylphide was not to be sold: Lady R. was very fond of her,\r\nand never seemed to understand the various hints thrown out from time to\r\ntime, with the utmost tact and delicacy, but still quite intelligibly,\r\nby Madame de N.; and all that the latter could do was to bring her\r\nutmost power of petting to bear on the subject of her adoration,\r\ntrusting to some unlooked-for stroke of good fortune to aid her in the\r\naccomplishment of her heart's desire.\r\n\r\nSylphide was excessively fond of sugar-plums (in which she was a great\r\nconnoisseur), and also of fresh _brioche_, crumbs of which she would\r\neat, in the most charming manner, from the snowy hand of her admiring\r\nfriend; and as the _bonbonniere_ of Madame de N. was always well\r\nsupplied with her favorite dainties, Sylphide, who, on her side, was not\r\nungrateful, soon contracted a lively affection for Madame de N. and her\r\nbonbonniere.\r\n\r\nSuch was the position of affairs, when an incident occurred which\r\nproduced a total estrangement between the two ladies. M. de S., a\r\ngentleman well known in the diplomatic circles, whom Madame de N. had\r\nlong numbered among her conquests, fascinated by the charms of the fair\r\nislander, deserted his brilliant countrywoman, and ranged himself among\r\nthe satellites of her rival. And by a curious coincidence, at the very\r\ntime that M. de S. quitted thus abruptly the orbit of Madame de N., the\r\nPrince of ----, who had hitherto been one of the brightest luminaries in\r\nthe train of Lady R., left her ladyship to lay his homage at the feet of\r\nthe charming Parisian. But the acquisition of the Prince seems to have\r\nfailed to console the latter for the loss of a knight who had so long\r\nworn her colors; and the defection of M. de S. drew from her an\r\nexpression of resentment towards her rival, which the mutual friend to\r\nwhom these angry feelings had been confided, lost no time in repeating\r\nto the object of her displeasure. But Lady R., so far from being\r\naffected by the indignation of Madame de N., merely replied, with a\r\ncareless shrug of her handsome shoulders, \"_Mais, ma chere_, she has\r\nreally nothing to complain of; all the world knows that '_exchange is no\r\nrobbery_!'\"\r\n\r\nAt this time a magnificent bracelet, the latest achievement of the\r\nwonder-working _ateliers_ of Froment & Meurice, had been the object of\r\nLady R.'s most violent desire; but her lord, who was subject to\r\noccasional attacks of a malady not uncommon to the husbands of beautiful\r\nand fashionable ladies, was just then suffering from an attack of\r\njealousy so acute, that, to the despair of Lady R., he utterly refused\r\nto gratify her desire to become the possessor of this costly ornament;\r\nand the lady, after having vainly called to her aid all the force of her\r\naddress, and all the charms of her eloquence, found herself obliged,\r\nthough with a heavy heart, to renounce the idea of its acquisition.\r\n\r\nLady R.'s desire for this bracelet, and its disappointment, were no\r\nsecret to Madame de N.; and on learning, from the gossiping confidant,\r\nthe response made by her rival to her complaint, a sudden thought darted\r\nthrough her mind. \"_Chere amie_,\" said she to the confidant, \"I beg you\r\nto say to her ladyship, that, since such is her opinion, I hold her to\r\nthe acceptance of the consequences of her maxim.\"\r\n\r\nThe confidant lost no time in delivering this message, to which Lady R.,\r\nthinking only of her host of admirers, laughingly replied, that Madame\r\nde N. was quite at liberty to make any practical application of the\r\nprinciple that she pleased.\r\n\r\nWithin two hours from the reception of this challenge, the beautiful\r\nbracelet, inclosed in an elegant case, on whose lid the initials of Lady\r\nR., surrounded by her crest, were engraved in letters of gold, had\r\npassed from the jeweller's show-rooms to the boudoir of Madame de N.,\r\nwho thenceforth, by means of an espionage that followed every movement\r\nof her rival, kept her constantly in view. At length the tournament, to\r\nbe followed by the balloon-ascension (held a week or two ago in the\r\nChamp de Mars), was announced to the great delight of the\r\nspectacle-loving public; and having learned that the fair Englishwoman\r\nwas to be present in an open carriage, Madame de N. determined to avail\r\nherself of this occasion to execute her scheme.\r\n\r\nAccordingly on the appointed day, the bracelet, in its elegant case,\r\nbeing placed in the carriage beside her, and the coachman duly\r\ninstructed in the part he was to play, Madame de N., holding in her hand\r\nher _bonbonniere_, supplied with fresh crumbs of the most delicate\r\n_brioche_, followed, at short distance, the carriage of her rival to the\r\nChamp de Mars, and took her stand just in the rear of her ladyship's\r\nphaeton.\r\n\r\nLady R. was in excellent spirits, receiving the homage of a crowd of\r\nattendant cavaliers; Sylphide, to the unspeakable joy of Madame de N.,\r\nbeing seated on the front seat nearest her carriage.\r\n\r\nMadame de N. waited patiently through the various evolutions of the\r\ngorgeous scene; and, at its close, when the great balloon of M. Poitevin\r\nrose majestically from the field, surrounded by its graceful band of\r\nnymphs that seemed to float, self-sustained, in the air, their silver\r\nwands and wreaths of flowers shining in the light of the setting sun,\r\nwhen all eyes followed the aeronauts, and deafening acclamations rent\r\nthe air, in less time than we take in recounting the movement, the\r\ncarriage of Madame de N. advanced to the side of Lady R.'s; Sylphide,\r\nattracted by the well-known _bonbonniere_, leapt lightly into the\r\noutstretched arms of her friend; and Madame de N. depositing the morocco\r\ncase on the very spot Sylphide had quitted, bowed gracefully to her\r\nrival, and drove rapidly away, before Lady R. had had time to comprehend\r\nwhat was passing.\r\n\r\nGreat was her ladyship's amazement, as may well be supposed; and great,\r\nfor the first few moments, was also her indignation; but the mystery was\r\nsoon explained; for, in opening the case, which occupied Sylphide's\r\nvacant place, and which was unmistakably intended for her, she perceived\r\nthe rich bracelet she had so much wished for, and beside it, the card of\r\nMadame de N., on which was written, in pencil, these words, which\r\ncontained the key of the enigma, \"_Exchange is no robbery_.\"\r\n\r\nA hearty laugh, which she tried in vain to repress, broke from the lips\r\nof the fair lady; much to the astonishment of the gentlemen who had\r\nwitnessed the scene, and to whom, notwithstanding their eager inquiries,\r\nLady R. very naturally declined giving any explanation of the affair.\r\n\r\nI shall observe your instructions, to keep you advised of whatever\r\noccurs here in the middle of the world.\r\n\r\n    STELLA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Authors and Books_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe German book trade has, for some months, been fairly overwhelmed with\r\nbooks upon Hungary. We notice among the latest, \"Flowers from Hungarian\r\nBattlefields,\" a collection of novelettes, with scenes drawn from real\r\nlife in the late war, by Sajo, one of the most popular writers of\r\nHungary. The stories are spirited and vivid. \"Confessions of a\r\nCivilian,\" and \"Confessions of a Soldier,\" are two books, of which the\r\nlast named has been for some time before the public, and has excited\r\nattention by the thoroughness of its absolutist tendencies. The Civilian\r\nis the opposite of the Soldier, being a liberal of the first stamp. Both\r\nthese writers, however, oppose the present Austrian ministry. A German\r\ntranslation of Horwath's \"History of the Hungarians\" is coming out at\r\nPesth in numbers, and is welcomed by the German critics. This is\r\nregarded by the most competent judges as an excellent work. \"Janos the\r\nHero,\" a Romance of Hungarian Peasant Life, by Alexander Petoefy, one of\r\nthe most popular Magyar writers, is spoken of as a most successful\r\ndelineation of national peculiarities. \"The Revolution and the Jews in\r\nHungary,\" is an interesting chapter out of the history of the Hungarian\r\nJews, by J. Eichorn. The fidelity of the Hebrews to the cause\r\nrepresented by Kossuth and his associates, and defended by the entire\r\nnation, is as well known as the extortions with which the butcher Haynau\r\nattempted to punish their patriotism. _Rerum Hungaricum Monumenta_ is\r\nthe last work of the lamented antiquarian Eudlicher, and is designed to\r\nopen to the literary world the authentic sources of early Hungarian\r\nhistory. It is, in short, a most valuable collection of ancient\r\ndocuments relating to the origin of the Magyars, their first settlement\r\nin Hungary, and their history under the native princes of the race of\r\nArpad. One of the best results of this work will be the provocation of\r\nother savans to similar investigations, which cannot fail to throw light\r\non many obscure historical questions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA very interesting work has just made its appearance at Leipsic, giving\r\nan intimate though by no means flattering account of the condition of\r\nthe POLISH POPULATION IN GALLICIA. The peculiarities of this race of\r\npeople are described as wild barbarism combined with elegant politeness,\r\ndreamy melancholy, and practical cunning. The author was in Gallicia\r\nbefore the peasants' insurrection in 1846. He narrates a variety of the\r\nmost striking scenes, which though highly colored are apparently true in\r\nthe main. Among other things he gives an account of a dinner-party to\r\nwhich he was invited, at the house of a nobleman. The house stood in the\r\nmidst of a scattered mass of outbuildings, none of which bore the\r\nslightest appearance of neatness, order, or comfort. Every thing, in\r\nfact, has the appearance of neglect and decay. Many of the walls are\r\nsupported by props to prevent them from tumbling. Around the doors the\r\nslightest rain produces a disgusting morass, while the general aspect of\r\nthe whole reminds the beholder of Attila's wooden palace in Pannonia,\r\nwhere he heaped up the booty of a world, and received the ambassadors of\r\nRome. When the writer reached the door, he found his host with some\r\nother gentlemen waiting to receive him. The company was numerous, and\r\nall, especially the ladies, expensively dressed, in the last Parisian\r\nfashion, with abundant jewelry and ornaments. The saloon in which they\r\nwere received was large but low, the walls covered with dirty paper, the\r\nfloor of rough boards, the furniture of all sorts and sizes, and nowhere\r\na trace of art or refined taste. The conversation was carried on in\r\nFrench, and the ladies exhibited a thorough acquaintance with Paris\r\nmatters, notabilities, and gossip generally. At the table the drinking\r\nwas almost incredible, and the topic of conversation, the emancipation\r\nof Poland. Every word was aimed at the conversion of the German guest.\r\nThe hard treatment of the serfs was spoken of as necessary, as they must\r\nbe kept in complete subjection in order to be made useful in the great\r\nwork. The festivity grew more and more ardent, till at last one of the\r\ngentlemen took a shoe off from a lady's foot, filled it with wine, and\r\nafter drinking from it himself, passed it to the others, so that all\r\ncould pledge the ladies from such a cup. The next morning the stranger\r\nsaw by chance a sight of another kind, as he was taking a walk. Behind a\r\nwall a man lay on the earth; another held fast his head, and a third his\r\nfeet, while a fourth stood over him with a whip, laying on with all his\r\nmight. The lord stood by in his dressing-gown, smoking a long pipe, and\r\ncoolly directing the procedure. The guest turned away from the\r\nspectacle, but was told by his servant that this was the tenth man who\r\nhad undergone the same punishment that morning. The offence was, that\r\nthey had not begun work at sunrise. Of course a peasantry so treated\r\ncould have no affection for their masters. All the work was done in the\r\nworst manner, while the lord was plundered in every way by his servants.\r\nOf the supplies for the family, more than half were regularly stolen,\r\nthere being no supervision in the household. The extravagance of the\r\nmasters was boundless, and when they got out of money they resorted to\r\nthe Jews, who had the whole commerce of the country in their hands,\r\nbesides having mortgages on most of the estates.\r\n\r\nThis is the merest outline of a small portion of the book. It renders\r\nmore intelligible the atrocities which took place in the insurrection of\r\n1846, and which the Austrian Government permitted, if they did not\r\nfoment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable philologists and travellers of the present\r\nday is the Hungarian Professor REGULY, a man as yet little known out of\r\nhis own country and northern Europe. He has devoted himself a good deal\r\nto the exposition of the affinities between the Magyar and the Finnish\r\nlanguages, and his labors have impelled a number of learned Hungarians\r\nto the same study. In the year 1839 he left his country, and passed ten\r\nyears in the north of Asia and Europe, mostly among the Finnish tribes\r\nof the Moguls, Ostiacks, Tsheremisses, Nordwins, &c., making himself\r\nfamiliar with their manners, customs, dialects, songs, and traditions,\r\nin order to attain a thorough personal acquaintance therewith. He also\r\nspent a long period in Kasan and St. Petersburgh, studying the other\r\nlanguages of Central Asia. His adventures during this time were, as may\r\nbe supposed, remarkable. He suffered not only the privations and\r\nexposures inseparable from such an undertaking, but was also poorly\r\nsupplied with money, and often in the greatest distress from that cause.\r\nNothing but scientific enthusiasm carried him through, till he became\r\nacquainted with some Russian savans, and a Russian Councillor named\r\nBalugyanszky, who were of great assistance to him. He left his home a\r\nvigorous young man, and comes back broken down in strength and health.\r\nHis investigations have related not only to philology, but to geography\r\nand ethnography. He has penetrated farther into the north of Asia than\r\nany previous traveller. On his return, at St. Petersburgh, he prepared,\r\nat the special request of the Geographical Society, a vast map of\r\nNorthern Asia along the Ural Mountains, between 58 and 70 deg. north\r\nlatitude, and 72 and 80 deg. east longitude, giving about five hundred\r\nlocalities. This map is made on the largest scale, containing sixteen\r\nlarge quarto sheets. The _St. Petersburgh Gazette_ says of it, that it\r\nhas proved Reguly to be the discoverer of a vast territory for Russia.\r\nHe is now at Pesth, engaged in preparing for publication the fruits of\r\nhis ten years' absence from home. He will treat of the languages of the\r\nEuropean and Asiatic Finnish tribes, their grammar and vocabularies,\r\nwith constant regard to the analogies of the Magyar tongue. By way of\r\nintroduction he will first publish a special work, containing his\r\nphilosophical views on the organism of language. After these\r\nphilological treatises he will print a series of ethnographic works on\r\nthe various races among which he has lived, with collections of their\r\nsongs and traditions, and finally a detailed narrative of his travels,\r\nwith a condensed account of their scientific results. The conclusion of\r\nhis philological studies is briefly, that the Central-Asiatic, or as it\r\nmight be called, the Ural-Altaic group of languages, is divided into six\r\nbranches or families, namely, the language of the Mandshu Tartars, the\r\nMongols, the Turkish-Tartar tribes, the Samoyedes, the Fins, and the\r\nMagyars. These families have however no nearer relation to each other\r\nthan the individual tongues of the Indo-European group, as the Indian,\r\nthe Romanic, German, Celtic, Slavic, and Persian languages. Still he\r\nregards the Magyar and Finnic languages as having greater mutual\r\naffinities than the others, though not to such a degree that one of\r\nthese races of men can be supposed to be derived from the other. He\r\nrather supposes all of the races whose languages form the\r\nCentral-Asiatic group to have sprung from an original race, which was\r\nprobably Scythian.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Austrian government has just set on foot an enterprise which\r\npromises to be of use to both Literature and Science. The plan is, to\r\nprepare and publish at the expense of the Imperial Treasury, a great\r\nwork on the ethnography of the Empire, and all savans, teachers,\r\nartists, poets, of every race, are invited to furnish materials. It is\r\ndesigned to give a complete account of the origin, history, manners,\r\nlanguage, character and condition of each of the many tribes and peoples\r\nincluded under the Austrian sceptre. This will be combined of course\r\nwith descriptions of the country, scenery, climate, soil, minerals, and\r\nnatural and industrial productions of each region. It is supposed that\r\nthe whole will be completed in eight big volumes. It will be accompanied\r\nby a vast ethnographic map, which is now being prepared with great\r\nenergy under the superintendence of the Minister of Commerce.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKARL GUTZKOW is one of the most prolific and popular novel and\r\nplaywrights now living in Germany. As to his last work, _Die Ritter vom\r\nGeiste_ (The Knights of the Spirit), of which only the first volume has\r\nbeen published, the critics entertain the most contradictory opinions.\r\nSome exclaim at its great length, which indeed is rather terrific: there\r\nare to be nine books, and the first occupies the whole of the first\r\nvolume. Others are charmed with the skill with which the details of the\r\nwork are wrought up, and the great variety of persons who figure in the\r\nstory. The author has certainly laid out all his strength in this book,\r\nwhich is designed to reproduce the present age in all the contradictions\r\nof its doctrines and the complexity of its tendencies. But instead of\r\nseizing these in some central and vital point, and setting them forth in\r\na work whose very simplicity would conceal its depth from most readers,\r\nGutzkow has adopted the easier and more clumsy method of multiplying his\r\ncharacters and complicating the actions of his drama. Thus it is hardly\r\npossible for it not to be tedious and a failure. But we can speak of it\r\nmore fairly when it is farther advanced.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. NEANDER'S Library is advertised for sale by auction at Berlin, but\r\nour correspondent thinks it will be saved from the hammer by a private\r\nsubscription, which will secure it to the University.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKARL SIMROCK has just brought out at Frankfort a new collection of\r\nGERMAN POPULAR SONGS, not obsolete or artistic poems, but such as still\r\nlive among the people, and are familiar to every class. \"Among\r\n_Volkslieder_,\" he says in his preface, \"I include only such as have\r\nproceeded directly from the people, and still bear the tokens of their\r\norigin, in their unsophisticated form, and simple, hearty language. The\r\npieces of cultivated poets which have found access and become loved with\r\nthe people, are reserved for a future collection of favorite German\r\nsongs. The distinction here hinted at between the people's songs and\r\npopular songs is not generally understood. All previous collections have\r\nconfused the two, and some even have not a single production of the\r\npeople. For example, _Des Knaben Wunderhorn_, whose great merit must be\r\nrecognized, contains antique poems which by no means issued from among\r\nthe people.\" In another place he says: \"The songs here collected and\r\narranged have been newly written down, literally from the mouths of the\r\npeople; and where they could not be procured in this way, have been\r\ncorrected by comparison of all earlier versions. So that as they here\r\nstand, they are in a sort my own property.\" The work is spoken of by\r\ncompetent critics as perfectly successful. We believe that Simrock, who\r\nis perhaps better qualified for the undertaking than any other man in\r\nGermany, intends in a future edition to publish the melodies of the\r\nsongs along with the words.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBelgian Literature is a standing joke with the authors of Paris, and not\r\nwithout reason, for the majority of the books printed by the publishers\r\nof Belgium, are pirated from their French neighbors. There is, however,\r\nsuch a thing as a Belgian literature, though it is not very extensive,\r\nand one of its chief ornaments is Professor BORGNEL, of Liege, best\r\nknown as the author of a _Historie des Belges a la fin du dix-huilieme\r\nSiecle_, published some six years since, to which he is about to bring\r\nout an addition, carrying the history back to the beginning of the same\r\ncentury. He has also been occupied for several years with the history of\r\nthe Flemish Provinces, under the domination of the Spaniards, and has a\r\nwork on that subject in preparation. The Introduction to it appeared not\r\nlong since among the Memoirs of the Brussels Academy, where it is\r\nentitled: _Philippe I. et la Belgique_. In treating a subject which the\r\nmasterly pen of Schiller has already rendered familiar to the world,\r\nProf. Borgnel does not attempt to imitate the ardent and splendid\r\neloquence of that great poet and historian; Borgnel's merits are\r\ndistinctness in his outlines, remarkable clearness of arrangement,\r\nperfect impartiality towards individuals and parties, and conscientious\r\nuse of materials. Of these he has had a greater variety, including many\r\nmanuscripts not before brought to light, than any previous writer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the new books announced in London is _Notes on North America,\r\nAgricultural, Social, and Economical_, by J. F. W. Johnston, author of\r\n\"Lectures on Agricultural Chemistry.\" We may anticipate something of\r\nvalue from a man of his studies and well earned reputation. Professor\r\nJohnston passed the greater portion of his time, while in America, in\r\nthe British Provinces. He had been led to believe that they offered the\r\nmost interesting field for his professional observation. When he came\r\ninto New-England, New-York and Pennsylvania, he was continually\r\nsurprised at the perfection and the success of our agriculture. He\r\nregretted only, that the mistake into which he had been led by British\r\ntravellers, had detained him from the United States until the period of\r\nhis absence from home was nearly expired. Professor Johnston's lectures\r\nin New-York were given under singular disadvantages, but the too small\r\naudiences who heard them were pleased and instructed. All who became\r\nacquainted with him were impressed with a belief of his candor and his\r\ntalents. We hope to see immediately an edition of his book in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Geissen, Prof. LIEBIG, has published a Review of the Progress of\r\nChemistry, Mineralogy, and Geology, in the year 1849. He has been\r\nassisted in its preparation by Professor Kopp and several other savans\r\nconnected with the University at Giessen. It is marked by his usual\r\ncompleteness, breadth of scope, and exhaustive treatment of each\r\nparticular subject. Liebig is now engaged in preparing a new series of\r\nChemical Letters, which will be specially devoted to the growth of this\r\nscience, in connection with the history of mental progress in general.\r\nProfessor Knobel, of the same University, has also issued a work on the\r\nGenealogies of the Book of Genesis, which excites remark by the\r\nthoroughness of its historical investigations. Leopold Schmid's last\r\nwork is on the Spirit of Catholicism, and also highly spoken of by both\r\nCatholic and Protestant writers. This author holds a high rank in the\r\nCatholic literature of Germany, and has been chosen Bishop of Mayence.\r\nProfessor Hillebrand is occupied with a revision of his highly esteemed\r\nHistory of German national literature since Lessing. There seems to be\r\nno reason to fear that Giessen is doing less than its share toward\r\nkeeping the ocean of German books up at a high-water mark.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBERANGER, the veteran _chansonier_, is now occupying himself in writing\r\nbiographies, anecdotes, criticisms, &c., of the public men with whom, in\r\nthe course of his long career, he has been in contact. It is five years\r\nsince he announced his intention of giving such a work to the public,\r\nand he thinks it will possess great historical value, while of his\r\nsongs, which alone will convey his name to the last ages in which the\r\nlanguage of France is spoken, he thinks but \"indifferently well.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe house, at Paris, in which EUGENE SUE laid some of the most exciting\r\nscenes of his \"Wandering Jew,\" has lately been advertised for sale, and\r\nhas been visited by crowds of curious loungers. It is known as the Hotel\r\nSerilly, and is situated at No. 5 Rue Neuve Saint Francois, in the\r\nquarter called the Marais. At the time the \"Wandering Jew\" was\r\npublished, the street was often filled by groups of gazers at the\r\nstrange old edifice, which had been so exactly described by the\r\nromancer, that no one could mistake it. Some even ventured to knock at\r\nthe door and seek further information. They were received by a\r\nmysterious and taciturn old Hebrew, who looked as if he himself had\r\ncharge of the great Rennepeal treasure, and three-quarters of the\r\nvisitors went away convinced that they had seen the veritable Samuel\r\nhimself. Now that the whole house has been thrown open to the public,\r\nthere have been found under it vast sub-cellars extending under the\r\nlarge garden in the rear, and in these cellars are seven wells,\r\npartially filled up, but with walls of careful masonry, and other\r\nindications that they were of great depth and great utility. The opinion\r\nwas at once set on foot by the explorers, that the millions of the\r\ntreasure had been concealed in one of these wells. The fact is, that the\r\nhouse formerly belonged to a Protestant family which suffered extreme\r\npersecution after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and which\r\ndoubtless found the subterranean passages extremely convenient. In the\r\nyear 1791, it was inhabited by the revolutionist Carnot.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe COUNT DE TOCQUEVILLE, a relative of the author of \"Democracy in\r\nAmerica,\" has just published a historical work on the Reign of Louis\r\nXVI. The writer, an old man almost sinking into the grave, enjoys the\r\nadvantage of having himself witnessed and even shared in a part of the\r\nevents he describes. He was intimate with Malasherbes, and personally\r\ndevoted to the unfortunate Louis. Of his ability as a writer, a former\r\nwork on the Reign of Louis XV. furnished proofs which are repeated in\r\nthe present volume. Of course he does full justice to the amiable\r\npersonal qualities of Marie Antoinette and her husband, without doing\r\ninjustice to their faults. But he shows that after all what was charged\r\nupon them as political crime, was but the consequence of long-standing\r\ncauses, over which they had no control, or even of measures of reform to\r\nwhich with the best intentions, they had given their consent. In\r\nspeaking of the mission of Franklin at the French Court, M. de\r\nTocqueville gives some interesting details. \"At Paris,\" he says, \"the\r\nzeal for the cause of the insurgents constantly increased. The women who\r\nexercised a great influence in the reign of Louis XVI., became\r\npassionate supporters of the Americans, and made aiding them a question\r\nof honor. The simple manners of their envoys,--their hair without\r\npowder, their citizens' dress, pleased by a sort of piquant novelty. All\r\nwho approached Franklin were charmed by his wit. In him people venerated\r\nthe founder of the liberty of a great nation, and even grew enthusiastic\r\nin behalf of that liberty.\" M. de Tocqueville shows however that the\r\nprime minister Maurepas only feared the Americans because he was\r\nembarrassed in his position, and thought to relieve himself by making\r\nwar with England. But as there was no good reason for making such a war,\r\nthe honesty of the King revolted at it. M. de Vergennes also said in the\r\nCouncil, that England would be much more weakened by a long war with her\r\ncolonies, than by their loss. \"But how,\" repeated all the women, \"can we\r\nhelp embracing the cause of a people which sends us ambassadors without\r\npowder, and with shoe-strings, instead of buckles?\" So weighty a reason\r\nturned the balance, and the war was declared. That war finished the ruin\r\nof the French monarchy, not only by inspiring the officers and soldiers\r\nsent to the United States with new ideas, but also by completing the\r\nexhaustion of its finances. With regard to the Revolution in which Louis\r\nXVI. lost his head, it is enough praise for our historian, that while he\r\ninclines always to the monarchical side, he is not altogether unjust to\r\nthe popular virtues which shone with such rare brilliancy amid the gloom\r\nof that epoch.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe great work of J. G. AUDUBON and the Rev. Dr. BACHMAN, upon the\r\n\"Viviparous Quadrupeds of North America,\" is much praised by those\r\npersons in Europe whose praise is of most value. The _Athenaeum_ remarks\r\nthat, hitherto, the mammalia of America have been known chiefly through\r\ndescriptions by zoologists, in the Transactions of European Societies,\r\nand that no systematic attempt has been made to bring together into one\r\nconnected view the very varied forms of animal life presented by this\r\ngreat continent, while these authors have not only used the materials\r\nwhich were at hand in the works of others, but have themselves observed\r\nwith great diligence the habits of many of the creatures which they have\r\ndescribed. \"Their work is creditable to the United States, where a large\r\nnumber of subscribers have induced the authors to undertake it,--and a\r\nmost valuable addition to our general natural-history literature.\" The\r\ngeographical range within which the animals described in these pages are\r\nfound is not that of the government of the United States merely; it\r\ncomprehends Russian and British America, in fact, all the country which\r\nlies north of the tropics in the New World.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the last MICHAELMAS BOOK FAIR at Leipsic, the Catalogue contained the\r\ntitles of 5,023 new works published in Germany since Easter. This is\r\nfrom twelve to fifteen hundred more than at any fair since the\r\nRevolution of 1848. A great number of these books are large and of\r\nremarkable merit, being in some sort, the accumulation of the more\r\nprofound scientific labors of the past two years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe BARONESS VON BECK has just published in London two volumes of\r\n\"Personal Adventures\" in the Hungarian war. She is herself a Hungarian,\r\nand she saw her husband fall while cheering his men to defend a\r\nbarricade at Vienna. In this book Kossuth is her hero, her prophet, her\r\ndemigod; and she sacrifices all other celebrities without compunction at\r\nthe altar of his greatness. Dembinsky she treats with manifest\r\ninjustice; Georgey comes out on her pages as a very Mephistopheles.\r\nKlapka himself does not escape without animadversion. But without\r\nadopting her opinions, either of the man she blames or the subject she\r\ndiscusses, it cannot be denied that she has great cleverness, and a\r\nwonderful power of exciting and interesting the reader.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA valuable scientific periodical is the _Geographisches Jahrbuch_ for\r\nthe Communication of all the more important New Investigations, edited\r\nby the distinguished BERGHAUS, and published by Perthes of Gotha. The\r\nlast number has an article by the editor on the system of \"Mountains and\r\nRivers of Africa,\" which differs altogether from what is laid down in\r\nthe present maps. The author lays down the river Nile as flowing from\r\nthe N'Yassi, and as connected with a great number of rivers in Dar Fur,\r\nWaday, and Fertil, with relation to which only the vaguest views have\r\nhitherto been entertained. The article shows, too, that the newly\r\ndiscovered lake N'Gami, in Southern Africa, has been long known under\r\nthe name of Nampur. The same number of the _Jahrbuch_ also contains an\r\narticle from the pen of the late lamented ALBERT GALLATIN, on the\r\nclimate of North America. This article was written in English, and was\r\ntranslated into German for the _Jahrbuch_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBERGHAUS has also lately issued a complete work of the highest interest,\r\nespecially now that so much attention is every where paid to\r\nEthnographic studies. Its title is _Grundlinien der Ethnographie_\r\n(Outlines of Ethnography). It is in two parts, and contains a universal\r\ntabular description of all the races of the globe, arranged\r\nethnographically and geographically, and according to languages and\r\ndialects, with a comparative view of their manners, customs, and habits.\r\nNo person who undertakes to investigate the origin of the human family\r\nand the mutual relations of its different members, can afford to be\r\nwithout this work. Published in Stuttgart.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBERTHOLD AUERBACH has just brought out a little volume of tales, which\r\nwe may well infer from his previous performances are charmingly replete\r\nwith grace, good humor, and a keen perception of whatever is peculiar to\r\nhis subject. The title of the book is _Deutsche Abende_ (German\r\nEvenings). It contains three stories: \"Nice People,\" \"What is\r\nHappiness?\" and \"The Son of the Forester.\" Published at Mannheim.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBARON STERNBERG, a dilettante book-maker of Germany, who generally\r\nresides at Berlin, has just added a new romance, or rather the beginning\r\nof one, to his previous publications. It bears the promising, if not\r\npretentious title, of _The German Gil Blas_ (published at Bremen), and\r\nclaims to be comic, as a matter of course. As a whole, the book is a\r\nfailure. Though there are passages here and there which may be read with\r\nsatisfaction, there is not enough unity and connection between the\r\ndifferent parts, and the humor is generally but a thin potation. It must\r\nbe said, however, that the absence of continuous interest is the fault\r\nof most comic novels, as well as poems. Even the matchless works of Jean\r\nPaul grow tedious by the endeavor to read much of them at a time, a fact\r\nwhich may be ascribed to the sentimentality and mere fantastics with\r\nwhich the kernels of his wit are overburdened. It is certain that no\r\nGerman humorous work can be compared with those great originals in that\r\nkind, Gil Blas and Don Quixote, or even with the much inferior works of\r\nSmollett and Dickens. Baron Sternberg's last effort forms no exception\r\nto this remark, and there is little hope that the second and concluding\r\nvolume, whose appearance in Germany ought to be made by this time, will\r\nprove superior to the first. His \"Royalists,\" an anti-democratic novel,\r\nwhich he had the courage to publish in the chaos of 1848, and which\r\nexcited much attention, and a great deal of severe criticism, was far\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"THE NEW FAITH SOUGHT IN ART,\" is the title of an anonymous little book\r\nlately issued at Paris, which, though not of great value, has more\r\npoetic originality of thought than is often found in printed pages. The\r\nauthor thinks that the time has gone by in which the subjects of art\r\ncould properly be sought in the lives of saints and legends of the\r\nChurch, and wishes to substitute for them the lives of artists and\r\ncelebrated inventors, who have sprung from the bosom of the people. With\r\nthis writer, every thing is democratic and popular. For him the people\r\nis alone King, and worthy of all honor. \"Nothing,\" he says in one place,\r\n\"is truer than the song of Beethoven. It is the song of life, the voice\r\nof truth, an infallible voice, which will create a world, and cause the\r\nold false world to crumble. Born of the people, the people sing in him,\r\nalthough they know him not.\" In painting, the heroes of the author are\r\nRuysdael, Rembrandt, Claude-Lorraine, and Paul Potter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Poet FREILIGRATH has received orders to leave the village of Bilk,\r\nin the neighborhood of Dusseldorf; where he was residing, and to quit\r\nthe Prussian territories. He will probably go back to England, where he\r\npassed some time in a counting-house or perhaps come to the United\r\nStates, where he has several friends, to whom he has written of such an\r\nevent as possible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn AFRICAN DISCOVERY greater advances have been made in the last two\r\nyears than before since the journeys of the brothers Lander. We\r\nmentioned in the last _International_ that the American traveller, Dr.\r\nW. Mathews, had been heard of at Vienna, and we now learn that he has\r\nbeen very successful in the five years of his adventure in the northern\r\nand central parts of the continent. Letters received in Berlin from Drs.\r\nBarth and Overweg, contain information of their having accomplished the\r\njourney across the Great Desert, or Sahara, and of their arrival near\r\nthe frontiers of the kingdom of Air or Asben, (Air is the modern\r\nTuarick, and Asben the ancient Sudan name), the most powerful in that\r\npart of Africa after Bornou, and never explored by Europeans. On the\r\n24th of August--the date of their last letter--they were at Taradshit, a\r\nsmall place in about 20 deg. 30' N. latitude, and 9 deg. 20' longitude E. of\r\nGreenwich. Among their discoveries are some of peculiar interest, one of\r\nwhich is of several curious and very ancient sculptures, apparently of\r\nEgyptian origin. The King of Prussia has, at the instance of the\r\nChevalier Bunsen and Baron Alexander von Humboldt, augmented the funds\r\nof the two travellers by a grant of 1,000 thalers.\r\n\r\nWhile Richardson, Barth and Overweg have penetrated the _terra\r\nincognita_ of the north, Dr. Krapf and the Rev. Mr. Rebmann have\r\nexplored the region described on the common maps as the \"Great Southern\r\nSahara,\" and found it to be fertile, healthy, abounding in mountains,\r\nvalleys and rivers, and inhabited by a race altogether superior to that\r\nwhich occupies the Atlantic coast. Mr. Mansfield Parkyns is endeavoring\r\nto cross the country southward from the Nile to the river Gambia; Mr.\r\nCharles Johnson is travelling in Abysinnia; Baron von Mueller is\r\nconducting an expedition up the White Nile; and the American\r\nmissionaries and colonists are gradually extending their knowledge over\r\nthe various settlements on the eastern coast of the continent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE PRUSSIAN EXPEDITION TO EGYPT, _Denkmaeler aus AEgypten und AEthiopien\r\nnach den Zeichnungen der von Sr. Majestat dem Koenige von Preussen\r\nFriedrich Wilhelm IV. nach diesen Laendern gesendeten, und in den Jahren\r\n1842-45, ausgefuhrten wissenschaftlichen Expedition: Herausgegeben von\r\nDr. R.

Every sect and\r\nparty issues its Almanac, and some issue several, crammed to the brim\r\nwith the peculiar notions whose dissemination is wished for. One of the\r\nmost successful for the year 1851, is the _Almanach des Opprimes_ (The\r\nAlmanac of the Oppressed). In fact, it is aimed wholly at the Society of\r\nJesuits, whose history it exposes in the blackest colors. It begins with\r\nthe early life of Loyola, depicts his debaucheries, his ambition, the\r\nreligious mechanism invented by his enthusiastic and fanatical genius,\r\nthe flexibility of his morality, and goes on to give an account of the\r\nintrigues and crimes of his successors in various countries and times,\r\nwith an analysis of their books, their missions and their miracles.\r\nAnother of these publications is called the _Almanach du Peuple_,\r\ncontaining a very great variety of articles of substantial value. Among\r\nthe contributors are, F. Arago, Quinet, Charras, Carnot, Girardin,\r\nGeorge Sand, Pierre Leroux, Dumil Aeur, E. Lithe, Mazzini, and other\r\nrepublicans distinguished in the political, literary and scientific\r\nworld. This Almanac had the honor last year of being seized by the\r\nGovernment, but on trial before a jury it was acquitted of the charge\r\nagainst it, of being dangerous to society, and provoking citizens to\r\nhate the republic and despise the authorities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA critic in the _Allegemeine Zeitung_, in noticing \"Ottomar, a Romance\r\nfrom the Present Time,\" the last novel from the pen of Madame Von\r\nZoellner, takes occasion to give some hard hits at women's novels in\r\ngeneral. \"It always must and always will be a failure,\" he says, \"when a\r\nwoman attempts to form a just conception of masculine character, and to\r\nput her conception into language. Female writers always comb out\r\nsmoothly the flaxen hair of their heroes, and dress them up in the\r\nfrockcoat of innocence. They go into raptures over a sort of green\r\nenthusiasm, and a romantic fantasticality of virtue, such as we godless\r\nfellows are not guilty of possessing; and in this way they turn out\r\nautomatons which resemble nothing in earth, heaven, or elsewhere.\" The\r\ncritic however admits that Madame Zoellner, who is undoubtedly one of the\r\nbest living German novel writers, possesses remarkable and peculiar\r\nmerits. No other woman occupies so high a place with the German public,\r\nexcept it be Fanny Lewald.

DE CORMENIN--and one\r\nof the most _spirituel_ of that _spirituel_ nation, said at Frankfort,\r\n\"It is true that it is difficult to abolish war, but it is far more\r\ndifficult to abolish death; and yet if people would take the same pains\r\nto avoid the one as they did to escape the other, they would certainly\r\naccomplish their object.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the most ardent and vigorous writers of Young France, Alphonse\r\nEsquiros, has brought out at Paris a new book called \"The History of the\r\nMartyrs of Liberty.\" The author aims to follow the development of\r\nliberty in humanity; to expose the tie which unites ancient and modern\r\nsociety in historic solidarity; to determine the transformation of the\r\ndoctrines, which, for a century past, have invaded the religious world\r\nunder the name of philosophy, political economy, and socialism; to set\r\nforth the fertile sufferings which have brought about that double\r\ntriumph of liberty in ideas and in facts, namely Christianity and the\r\nFrench Revolution; to indicate the questions yet undecided; and to call\r\nto their solution both the miseries of the laboring classes and the\r\nlights of science.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhatever may be said of the more elaborate writings of GEORGE SAND, it\r\nis impossible for the most scrupulous critic to deny or resist the charm\r\nof her smaller works, such as the \"Mosaic Workers,\" the \"Devil's Love,\"\r\nand \"Fadette.\" To these she has just added another, which is spoken of\r\nwith the utmost delight by all who have read it, as a work of remarkable\r\ngenius. It is intended for the use of children, and is called \"The\r\nHistory of the veritable Gribonille.\" The text is accompanied by richly\r\nengraved illustrations, designed by Mr. Maurice Sand, the son, we\r\nbelieve, of the author. Why will not some American publisher give us a\r\ntranslation, with the original illustrations?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo the already immense literature of the French Revolution, we now have\r\nto signalize another addition, which is worth the attention of those who\r\nare not weary of books relating to that momentous epoch. It is a\r\n\"Biography of Camille Desmoulins,\" by Ed. Fleury--an octavo volume,\r\nlately issued at Paris. The author discusses the history of this famous\r\npamphleteer and revolutionary rhetorician, as an advocate defends a\r\nclient before a jury.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE PRINCIPLES, INSTITUTIONS AND LAWS OF THE FRENCH\r\nREVOLUTION, from 1789 to 1800, is an anti-revolutionary work of\r\nelaborate character, and decided ability, published a few weeks since at\r\nParis, by an anonymous author, who thinks he can do something toward\r\ngetting the world right by rolling back some of its more recent\r\ngyrations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA popular History of the French Revolution, from 1789 to 1799, written\r\nby HIPPOLITE MAGEN, and lately published at Paris, in one volume, is\r\nhaving a great success among the laboring classes of Paris and other\r\nFrench cities.

It is in great\r\npart the result of original investigations, and in many particulars\r\ndeparts from the received biographies, while in others it casts a new\r\nlight on facts previously known. The critics of Vienna speak in the\r\nhighest terms of it, as worthy to be named along with the most brilliant\r\nFrench productions on the same subject. They are, however, bound to say\r\nthe best thing possible for a book by a Viennese author, since they have\r\nbut few to rejoice in.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE MEMOIRS OF MASSENA, which have for some time been in course of\r\npublication at Paris, are at last completed, by the issue of the final\r\nvolume, which contains the history of the campaign of 1810-11, in\r\nPortugal. No complete account of this campaign has ever before been\r\npublished. The book also casts a great deal of light not merely on the\r\nhistory of the Marshal himself, but on the wars of Napoleon in general.\r\nIt is founded on documents left by Massena, which have not before been\r\npublished or consulted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM.

It bears no mark\r\nof a woman's hand: it is rugged, massive, and sublime, as befits the\r\ngrand old fate drama which the genius of the Greek moulded out of the\r\nimmortal agony of the beneficent Titan. From the new poems we select the\r\nfollowing exquisite love sonnets, from a series scarcely inferior to\r\nthose in which Shakspeare has given the history of his heart-life:\r\n\r\n    \"I lift my heavy heart up solemnly,\r\n    As once Electra her sepulchral urn,\r\n    And, looking in thine eyes, I overturn\r\n    The ashes at thy feet. Behold and see\r\n    What a great heap of grief lay hid in me,\r\n    And how the red wild sparkles dimly burn\r\n    Through the ashen grayness. If thy foot in scorn\r\n    Could tread them out to darkness utterly,\r\n    It might be well perhaps. But if instead\r\n    Thou wait beside me for the wind to blow\r\n    The gray dust up, ... those laurels on thine head,\r\n    O my beloved, will not shield thee so,\r\n    That none of all the fires shall scorch and shred\r\n    The hair beneath. Stand further off, then! Go.\r\n\r\n    \"Go from me. Yet I feel that I shall stand\r\n    Henceforward in thy shadow. Never more\r\n    Alone upon the threshold of my door\r\n    Of individual life, I shall command\r\n    The uses of my soul, nor lift my hand\r\n    Serenely in the sunshine as before,\r\n    Without the sense of that which I forbore,\r\n    Thy touch upon the palm. The widest land\r\n    Doom takes to part us, leaves thy heart in mine\r\n    With pulses that beat double. What I do\r\n    And what I dream include thee, as the wine\r\n    Must taste of its own grapes. And when I sue\r\n    God for myself, He hears that name of thine,\r\n    And sees within my eyes, the tears of two.\r\n\r\n    \"Beloved, my beloved, when I think\r\n    That thou wast in the world a year ago,\r\n    What time I sat alone here in the snow,\r\n    And saw no foot-print, heard the silence sink\r\n    No moment at they voice; ... but link by link\r\n    Went courting all my chains, as if that so\r\n    They never could fall off at any blow\r\n    Struck by thy possible hand.... Why, thus I drink\r\n    Of life's great cup of wonder. Wonderful,\r\n    Never to feel thee thrill the day or night\r\n    With personal act or speech,--nor ever call\r\n    Some prescience of thee with the blossoms white\r\n    Thou sawest growing! _Atheists are as dull,\r\n    Who cannot guess God's presence out of sight._\r\n\r\n    \"First time he kissed me, he but only kissed\r\n    The fingers of this hand wherewith I write,\r\n    And ever since it grew more clear and white;\r\n    How to world greetings ... quick with its 'Oh, list,'\r\n    When the angels speak. A ring of amethyst\r\n    I could not wear there plainer to my sight\r\n    Than that first kiss. The second passed in height\r\n    The first, and sought the forehead, and half-missed,\r\n    Half falling on the hair. O, beyond meed!\r\n    That was the chrism of love, which love's own crown,\r\n    With sanctifying sweetness, did precede.\r\n    The third, upon my lips was folded down,\r\n    In perfect purple state!

As, however, of the\r\n\"four nations\" into which the students were distributed, each of the\r\ncandidates had two, the election should have been decided by the vote of\r\nthe present Rector, Mr. Macaulay; but he declines the duty, and would\r\nnot go to the university during the contest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Official Gazette announces that \"the Queen has been pleased to\r\nappoint ALFRED TENNYSON, Esq., to be Poet Laureate in ordinary to her\r\nMajesty, in the room of William Wordsworth, Esq., deceased.\" There have\r\nbeen poorer poets than Tennyson among the laureates; but this\r\nappointment does not and ought not to give much satisfaction. Mr.\r\nTennyson had already a pension from the government, and was in no need\r\nof the salary of this office, as one or two others, and as we conceive,\r\ngreater poets, are; and it had been hoped that the queen would appoint\r\nto the place the _greatest poet of her own sex_ who has lived in\r\nEngland--Elizabeth Barrett Browning.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe original MS. of \"WAVERLEY,\"--wholly in the handwriting of Sir Walter\r\nScott,--the same which was sold in 1831 with the other MSS. of the\r\nseries of novels and romances--has been presented to the Advocates'\r\nLibrary at Edinburgh, by Mr. James Hall, brother of the late Capt.

BELL MARTIN, at the Union Place Hotel, in\r\nthis city, was briefly noticed in the last number of the\r\n_International_. It appears from a statement in the London _Times_ that\r\nthe vast estates known as the Connemara property, to which she had\r\nsucceeded as the daughter and heiress of the late Mr. Thomas Martin, of\r\nBallinahinch Castle, in Galway, was among the first brought into the new\r\n\"Encumbered Estates Court,\" and has been for some months advertised for\r\nsale. The Dublin _Evening Mail_ has the following remarks upon the\r\nmelancholy history of Mrs. Martin, whose novel of \"Julia Howard\" must\r\npreserve for her a very distinguished rank among the literary women, of\r\nour time:\r\n\r\n     \"The vicissitudes of life have seldom produced a sadder or more\r\n     rapid reverse than that by which the fortunes of this excellent\r\n     lady were darkened and overthrown. Born to a noble inheritance\r\n     which extended over a territory far exceeding the domain of\r\n     many a reigning German prince, her name was known throughout\r\n     the United Kingdom as that of \"the Irish heiress.\" Five years\r\n     ago her expectancy was considered to be equivalent, over and\r\n     above all encumbrances and liabilities, to a yearly income of\r\n     5,000_l._ Before two years of the interval had elapsed she\r\n     found herself at the head of her patrimonial estates, without a\r\n     shilling that she could call her own. The failure of the potato\r\n     crop, the famine and pestilence which followed, the scourging\r\n     laws enacted and enforced by an ignorant Legislature to redress\r\n     the calamity, and the claims of money-lenders, swept every inch\r\n     of property from under her feet. Her hopes and her prospects\r\n     were for ever blighted. Her projects for the improvement of the\r\n     wild district over which she had reigned as a sort of native\r\n     sovereign were at an end; and she went forth from the roof of\r\n     her fathers as a wanderer, without a home, and, as it would\r\n     almost appear, without a friend. Never was hard fate less\r\n     deserved; for her untiring and active benevolence had been\r\n     devoted from her childhood to the comfort and relief of those\r\n     who suffered, and her powerful and original mind was\r\n     incessantly employed in devising means of moral and physical\r\n     amelioration in the condition of the tenantry on her father's\r\n     estates. She gave up her whole time to such pursuits, avoiding\r\n     the haunts of fashion and those amusements which might be\r\n     considered suitable to her age and place, that she might\r\n     perform the various duties of physician, almoner,\r\n     schoolmistress, and agricultural instructor. Her almost daily\r\n     habit was to visit the poor and the sick in the remote recesses\r\n     of that wild region, sometimes on foot--more frequently in her\r\n     little boat, well provided with medicaments and food, which she\r\n     impelled by the vigor of her own arm through the lakes which\r\n     stretch along the foot of the mountains. How grievous it is to\r\n     reflect that she should so soon have been driven across the\r\n     ocean in search of a place to lay her head. The American editor\r\n     intimates that the object of her voyage was to collect\r\n     materials for literary works. We have no doubt that such was\r\n     among her projects; for she was a very distinguished writer,\r\n     and would by no means eat the bread of idleness or dependence;\r\n     but there is reason to believe that it was a more stringent\r\n     compulsion which obliged her, at an advanced period of the\r\n     year, and in a peculiarly delicate situation, when even\r\n     peasants remain on shore, to encounter the tedium and perils of\r\n     a voyage in a sailing vessel. We have heard, in fact, from a\r\n     quarter which ought to be correctly informed, that she was\r\n     proceeding to the residence of a near relative of her father,\r\n     with the intention of remaining there till some favorable\r\n     change might come over the color of her life.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur countrywoman, MRS. MOWATT, has revised and partially rewritten her\r\nnovels of \"The Fortune Hunter,\" and \"Evelyn, or the Heart Unmasked,\" and\r\nthey have just been published in London. The _Athenaeum_ says of them:\r\n\r\n     \"These tales give us a higher idea of Mrs. Mowatt's talents as\r\n     an authoress, than her plays did. Taken in conjunction with\r\n     those dramas, and with the pleasing powers as an actress\r\n     displayed by the lady,--they not only establish a case of more\r\n     than common versatility, but indicate that with labor and\r\n     concentration, so gifted a person might have taken a high\r\n     place, whether on the library shelf or on the stage. In another\r\n     point of view, they are less agreeable. Alas, for those\r\n     primitive souls, who with a perverse constancy may still wish\r\n     to fancy America a vast New-England of simple manners and\r\n     superior morals! The society which Mrs. Mowatt\r\n     describes--whether in 'Evelyn,' which begins with a wedding out\r\n     of Fleecer's boarding-house, or in 'The Fortune Hunter,' which\r\n     opens with table-talk at Delmonico's--is as sophisticated as\r\n     any society under which this wicked old world groans, and which\r\n     our Sir E. Lytton and Mrs. Gore have satirized--or Balzac (to\r\n     shame the French) has \"shown up.\" _Major Pendennis_ himself\r\n     could hardly have produced anything more _blase_ in tone than\r\n     some of the pictures of 'New-York Society' drawn by this\r\n     American lady,--drawn, moreover, when the lady was young.\r\n     Evelyn is married to a rich man, without her heart having any\r\n     thing to say in the matter,--by a mother who is a superfine\r\n     _Mrs. Falcon_:--and wretched mischief comes of it. Brainard,\r\n     the fortune hunter, is a heartless and cynical illustration\r\n     that a Broadway hunter can be as unblushingly mercenary, and as\r\n     genteelly dishonorable as the veriest old Bond Street hack,\r\n     bred up in the traditions of the Regency, who ever began life\r\n     on nothing and a showy person--continued it on nothing and the\r\n     reputation of fashion--and ended no one cares how or where.\r\n     There are character, smartness and passion in both these\r\n     tales--though a certain looseness of structure and\r\n     incompleteness of style prevent us from being extreme in\r\n     praising them, or from recommending them by quotation,--and\r\n     though, as has been said, the tone and taste of the life which\r\n     they describe must jar on the feelings of those who are\r\n     unwilling to see the decrepitude of elderly civilization coming\r\n     down upon a new country, ere its maturity has been reached--or\r\n     even ere its youth has been sufficiently and steadily trained.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMRS.

Mr.\r\nMackay has had experience in the collection of statistical information;\r\nhe has lived long enough abroad to know that essential differences\r\nsometimes lurk beneath external resemblances in the social arrangements\r\nof two countries, and to be on his guard against the erroneous\r\ninferences to which ignorance of this fact leads. He is naturally acute,\r\nenergetic, and cautious. For the difficult task of investigating and\r\nreporting upon the condition of an important branch of industry, and the\r\ncircumstances which are likely to promote or retard its progress among a\r\ncommunity so different from the English as that of India, he is probably\r\nas well fitted as any man who could have been selected. The foundation\r\nof the British Indian empire and the establishment of the United States\r\nas an independent nation, were contemporary events. The loss of her\r\nAmerican colonies helped to concentrate the attention and exertions of\r\nEngland upon her Indian dominions. The progress made by British India\r\nsince 1760, in civilization, material wealth, and intelligent\r\nenterprise, is barely perceptible; while the United States have expanded\r\nfrom a few obscure colonies into a nation second only to Great Britain\r\nin the value and extent of their commercial relations, second to none in\r\nintelligence and successful enterprise. The Anglo-Norman inhabitants of\r\nthe \"Old Thirteen\" provinces have made the valley of the Mississippi,\r\nand the prairies beyond it, which little more than half a century ago\r\nwere mere wastes, the thronged abodes of a vigorous and wealthy European\r\npopulation. They have done this without the aid of the aboriginal\r\ntribes, who have proved irreclaimably addicted to their nomade habits.\r\nThe Anglo-Normans who rule British India have had to deal with a country\r\nthickly peopled with races far advanced in civilization, though of a\r\npeculiar character; yet, in every respect, the results of their efforts\r\nlag far behind those visible in America. To place the difference in a\r\nmost striking point of view, it is only necessary to contrast the cotton\r\nproduce and the mercantile marine of British India with those of the\r\nUnited States. There is actually a more fully-developed steam navigation\r\nbetween Panama and California than between Bombay and China. The causes\r\nof these results are plain enough to us, but to the English they are\r\nenigmas. The mission of Mr. Mackay will scarcely end in a revelation of\r\nthe truth, that liberty and independence have kept healthy the blood in\r\nthe vigorous limbs of the Americans, while trammels and vassalage have\r\ndeadened the energies of the Indies; but it may have an important\r\ninfluence upon the question whether the East India Company's charter\r\nshall be renewed, and it certainly will develop much information\r\ninteresting to the cotton-growers of the United States.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR.

Some may not regard him,\r\n     as we do, the very greatest living master of the English\r\n     language; some may think lightly of those fragmentary works and\r\n     fugitive articles with which he has for more than thirty years\r\n     enriched our literature; but, whatever may be the individual\r\n     estimate of his services, one fact is patent, namely, that you\r\n     cannot mention De Quincey in any circle of the British Islands,\r\n     pretending to literary culture, but his name will sound\r\n     familiar; in most it will awaken responses of gratitude for\r\n     high pleasures bestowed, in none will it arouse indignation of\r\n     high power to base uses. Now, this we call a clear case for\r\n     national beneficence. He has done the state service, and they\r\n     know it; but they will not reward it.\"\r\n\r\nApropos of pensions: Upon the whole, we have the best exchequer in the\r\nworld, and to _soldiers_ we have evinced no special lack of liberality.\r\nTo give five hundred dollars a year to Mr. Audubon, R. H. Dana, Moses\r\nStuart, Edward Robinson, H. R. Schoolcraft, James G. Percival, C. F.\r\nHoffman, and some half dozen others, would be something toward an\r\n\"honorable discharge\" of the country's obligations in the premises, and\r\nprobably no slight addition to the happiness of men who have added much\r\nto the real glory of the nation, while it would cost less than a\r\nmorning's useless debate in Congress. In a recent letter to Lord\r\nBrougham, on a cognate subject, Savage Landor exclaims:\r\n\r\n     \"Probably the time is not far distant when the arts and\r\n     sciences, and even literary genius, may be deemed no less\r\n     worthy of this distinction than the slaughter of a thousand\r\n     men. But how, in the midst of our vast expenditure, spare so\r\n     prodigious a sum as five hundred a year to six, and three\r\n     hundred a year to six more!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA MR. CHUBB has published in London, in a small volume, a paper which he\r\nread before the Institution of Civil Engineers, on the construction of\r\nlocks and keys. It embraces a history of the lock and key from the\r\nearliest ages, illustrated profusely with wood cuts. It forms an\r\ninstructive and entertaining essay; but we think Mr. Chubb might have\r\nlearned something more of the subject in the lock factories of Newark\r\nand this city.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR.

DICKEN'S \"David Copperfield\" is at length completed, and Mr. Wiley\r\nhas published it in two handsome volumes, profusely illustrated. There\r\nis a variety of opinions among the critics as to its rank among the\r\nworks of \"Boz\"; but it is not contended by any that it evinces a decay\r\nof his extraordinary and peculiar genius. We copy a paragraph which\r\nstrikes us as just, from the _Spectator_:\r\n\r\n     \"This story has less of London life and town-bred character\r\n     than most of its predecessors; but what may thus be gained in\r\n     variety is lost in raciness, breadth, and effect. The peculiar\r\n     classes forced into existence by the hotbed of a great city,\r\n     and owing a part of their gusto to town usage, may be narrow\r\n     enough if compared with general nature, but they are broader\r\n     than the singularities whom Mr. Dickens copies or invents as\r\n     representatives of genteel country life, or human nature in\r\n     general. In the mere style there is frequently an\r\n     improvement--less effort and greater ease, with occasional\r\n     touches of the felicity of Goldsmith; but we should have\r\n     thought the work was likely to be less popular than many of the\r\n     previous tales of Mr. Dickens, as well as rather more open to\r\n     unfavorable criticism. Any prose fiction that is to take rank\r\n     in the first class, must have what in epic poetry is called a\r\n     fable,--some lesson of life embodied in a story that combines\r\n     the utile and the dulce. This fable should not only please the\r\n     reader by its succession of coherent events, and by the variety\r\n     of its persons and fortunes, but should touch by appeals to the\r\n     common kinship of humanity, and teach worldly conduct of\r\n     ethical lessons by particular incidents, as well as by the\r\n     general development. And when this end is attained, whether by\r\n     design or instinct, technical rules are readily forgotten; even\r\n     the great rule of unity of action can be dispensed with. It\r\n     does not appear that Mr. Dickens has the critical training\r\n     necessary to feel the importance of this principle, or a\r\n     knowledge of life sufficiently deep and extensive to enable him\r\n     to embody it unconsciously, as a well-chosen story will always\r\n     compel an author to do. So far as _David Copperfield_ appears\r\n     designed with any other object than as a vehicle for writing a\r\n     number of sketches, it would seem intended to trace the London\r\n     career of an inexperienced young man, with infirmity of\r\n     purpose, a dangerous friend, and no very experienced advisers.\r\n     Any purpose of this kind is only prosecuted by snatches; \"the\r\n     theme\" is constantly deserted, and matters are introduced that\r\n     have no connection with the hero further than his being present\r\n     at them, or their occurring to his acquaintance. In fact, from\r\n     the time that David Copperfield emerges from boyhood, the\r\n     interest in _his_ adventures ceases, beyond that sort of\r\n     feeling which many readers entertain of wishing to know 'how it\r\n     ends.'\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR. DAVID DUDLEY FIELD, of this city, one of the three commissioners who\r\nprepared the amended Code of the State of New-York, abolishing the\r\ndistinction in procedure between law and equity, being in England for a\r\nbrief visit, was invited by the leading members of the Law Amendment\r\nSociety to give some account of the great changes effected here in the\r\nadministration of justice. He complied, and a meeting of the Society was\r\nsummoned specially to hear him. The result is much remarked upon in\r\nnearly all the London journals. Mr. Field is a clear headed man, master\r\nof his subject, perspicuous in his rhetoric, and distinct in his\r\nelocution, so that our new constitution was most advantageously\r\ndisplayed before his learned and critical hearers. The _Spectator_ says\r\nof the subject:\r\n\r\n     \"The visit of Mr. Dudley Field to England, and his interesting\r\n     statements to the members of our Law Amendment Society, are\r\n     real events in the progress of law reform in this country. The\r\n     injustice which the English people submit to in the revered\r\n     name of Law, and in the sacred but in their case profaned name\r\n     of Equity, is more enormous than the future historian will be\r\n     able remotely to conceive. The keystone of the barbarous Gothic\r\n     portal to Justice in our common-law procedure was struck out\r\n     some twenty years ago, when the logical forms of legal contest\r\n     were reduced to their now moderate number; other heavy blows\r\n     have further undermined the ruin, and almost cleared away\r\n     whatever was feudal in that portion of the edifice; and then\r\n     came the raising of the new and noble portal of the County\r\n     Courts. Still, in all but the most trivial litigation the delay\r\n     and expense are such that justice can only be had at a\r\n     percentage utterly disgraceful to a nation either honest or\r\n     merely clearheaded and commercial. We still preserve a\r\n     diversity of tribunals, to administer laws that ought not to be\r\n     inharmonious; and we are prevented from making the laws\r\n     harmonious by the difficulties of finding tribunals able to\r\n     rule the concord and administer the whole field of law as a\r\n     single empire. In this case, as in a multitude of others, our\r\n     young relations across the Atlantic have done that which we\r\n     only longed to do. In this rivalry of nations, far above all\r\n     other rivalries, they have pushed development of institutions\r\n     which they received from forefathers common to us both, to a\r\n     more rapid perfection than we. Mr. Dudley Field is one of three\r\n     men who framed a constitutional law for the State of New York,\r\n     under which the courts of legal and equitable jurisdiction have\r\n     been successfully merged; the enactment has succeeded in\r\n     practical working; and the spectacle of \"Equity swallowing up\r\n     Law\" has been so edifying to the citizens of his State, that\r\n     three other States of the Union have resolved to enact, and\r\n     four further States have appointed conferences to deliberate\r\n     upon, a similar procedure. It is impossible--however\r\n     narrow-minded lawyers may object--that what Americans find\r\n     practicable and beneficial should be either impracticable or\r\n     disadvantageous to Englishmen.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA second part of the \"Historical Collections of Louisiana,\" by B. F.\r\nFrench, has been published by Mr. Putnam. It contains some interesting\r\npapers, among which are translations of an original letter of Hernando\r\nde Soto, on the Conquest of Florida, of a brief account of de Soto's\r\nmemorable expedition to Florida, from a recently discovered manuscript\r\nby a writer named Biedma, and Hackluyt's translation of the longer\r\nnarrative \"by a gentleman of Elvas.\" It is to be followed, we\r\nunderstand, by a second volume.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nELIHU BURRITT is one of those people who are filled with the comfortable\r\nassurance of their own greatness. He seems always to regard the mob of\r\nmen as very diminutive creatures, while his introverted glances are\r\nthrough a lens which reveals a character of qualities and proportions\r\nthe most extraordinary. This is unfortunate. It renders Mr. Elihu\r\nBurritt, _par excellence_, the bore of his generation. He is really a\r\nperson of very small abilities; of very little information, considering\r\nthe opportunities presented by his travels; and the \"_learned_\r\nblacksmith\" has no learning at all. He had, indeed, an unusual facility\r\nin acquiring words, but he knows nothing of languages; not having in any\r\na particle of scholarship; of the philosophy, even of his mother tongue,\r\nbeing as ignorant as the bellows-hand in his smithy at Worcester. But\r\nbecause of this not uncommon faculty of acquiring words--acquiring them\r\nas Zerah Colburn did a certain mastery of figures, without being able to\r\ncomprehend any principle of mathematics--Mr. Everett, or some one else,\r\nadvertised him as \"learned,\" and ever since he has neglected his fit\r\nvocation to crowd himself into conspicuous places, all over Christendom;\r\nto blow continually his penny whistle in the ears of the little people\r\ncalled philanthropists; to speak and write in addresses and letters\r\nimmense aggregations of ambitious platitudes, to pontiffs, emperors,\r\nkings, parliaments, etc., respecting their particular affairs, all of\r\nwhich addresses and letters are as cogent as the barkings sent by a\r\nlap-dog toward the moon, and receive from all sorts of people, except\r\ndiminutives and impertinents whose profession is \"philanthropy,\" just\r\nabout as much consideration as Dian yields to the fast-yelping cur. It\r\nis all unfortunate, for poor Elihu Burritt will never be persuaded that\r\nhe is a subject of derision only, instead of admiration; that men pause\r\nto regard him as a miracle of conceit and assurance rather than as a\r\nprophet; and that his commonplaces about \"olive leaves,\" \"calumets,\"\r\n\"universal brotherhood,\" \"fatherland,\" etc., have no more influence than\r\nthe maudlin rigmarole of the madman whose preternatural force is lost in\r\nsenility. It is time for Elihu Burritt to go back to his shop: the world\r\nwants a new fool.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOHN MILLS, remembered by some unfortunate New-Yorkers as John _St.\r\nHugh_ Mills, has written half a dozen tolerable novels since he went\r\nhome, and he is now publishing, in the _United Service Magazine_, a\r\nseries of papers illustrative of his American travels, in which he\r\nillustrates his knowledge and veracity by certain anecdotes, which are\r\ndescribed as having occurred on \"_the western prairies of Louisiana_.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT HITCHCOCK, of Amherst College, who is capable of a very\r\nconclusive treatment of the subject, has in the press of Philips &\r\nSampson, a work on the connection of Geology and Religion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDR. LATHAM'S very important work on the \"Varieties of Man,\" we are glad\r\nto hear is to be republished by the Appletons. Though much less\r\nvoluminous than the work of Pritchard, and therefore less particular\r\ngenerally in its illustrations, it may be regarded as decidedly the most\r\nmasterly and satisfactory production that has yet appeared in ethnology.\r\nThe prospect of its republication affords us the more satisfaction,\r\nbecause the superficial and flippant infidelity of Dr. Robert Knox has\r\nbeen reproduced here by a respectable publishing house, and widely\r\ndiffused. The \"Races of Man,\" by Dr. Knox, is what is called a clever\r\nbook; the Yankees might style it \"smart;\" but it is no more entitled to\r\nconsideration as an exhibition of scholarship, intellectual strength, or\r\nfairness, than the rigmarole of the Millerite or the Mormon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE HOMOEOPATHIC REVIEW AND QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE, is a\r\nnew periodical, commencing with the year, of which the general character\r\nis indicated by the title. It is edited by Dr. Marcy, author of \"The\r\nHomoeopathic Theory and Practice,\" one of the most eminent scholars\r\nand successful practitioners of the new school; Dr. Herring, of\r\nPhiladelphia, whose name is familiar to the students of German\r\nliterature and science, and who was one of the most trusted friends of\r\nHahnemann; and Dr. Metcalfe, who has been known as an able lawyer and\r\ningenious critic, and who is regarded as a very accomplished physician.\r\nUnder such direction, the Homoeopathic Review can hardly fail of\r\nsuccess. It will certainly, we think, commend the doctrines of the\r\nHahnemannists to the favorable consideration of all thoughtful readers,\r\nand compel those who have been accustomed to deride the new principles\r\nto a courteous treatment of them.

American publishers have done much toward bringing literature\r\ninto the homes of the poor, but the cheap books manufactured in this\r\ncountry have, for the most part, been badly printed, and in every\r\nrespect so wretchedly put together, that they were hardly worth\r\npreserving after a first reading. The English are now competing\r\nvigorously for the popular market here, and mainly, through the house of\r\nBangs & Brother of this city. Bohn and other great London publishers are\r\nsupplying us with well printed, well bound, and excellently illustrated\r\nbooks, at prices altogether lower than those for which the American\r\nmanufacturers have offered or can afford them. To sell such a book as\r\n_Lodge's Portrait Gallery_, in eight volumes, with all its finely\r\nengraved heads, for ten dollars, one must have the world for a market;\r\nand so with the long list of important writings in the compactly but\r\ncorrectly and elegantly printed volumes of Bohn's Standard Library--the\r\nbest and cheapest popular series ever issued in any country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMany very correct writers are very poor authors, and there are abundance\r\nof good books with imperfect rhetoric; yet we have a right to ask some\r\nattention to the details of style in a literary critic. Professor Henry\r\nReed has a delicate appreciation in poetry, but his remarks are nearly\r\nalways marred by verbal infelicities incompatible with a knowledge of\r\nliterary art. Thus, within a few pages of his Memoir of Gray, just\r\npublished, he says of Jacob Bryant, who has been dead a century, that\r\n\"he _has_ recorded;\" that \"Gray retained a high admiration of Dryden's\r\npoetry, _as_ was strongly expressed,\" &c.; that an ode published in\r\n1747, \"being the first publication _of_ his English verse\" (meaning his\r\nfirst publication in English verse); that Gray could not \"break through\r\nthe circumspection of so contracted a system of metaphysics _as that of\r\nLocke's_;\" that \"it is apparent from what Gray _has_ done\" (as if Gray\r\nwere now living, or present), &c. &c. &c. &c. &c., all through every\r\nthing he publishes. Such things in a professor of mathematics would\r\nattract no attention, but they will be observed in a \"Professor of\r\nEnglish Literature.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. BANCROFT is not, as we were led by some newspaper to state in the\r\n_International_, engaged in printing his History of the Revolution; and\r\nwhen he does give it to the press, it is by no means likely that he will\r\nhave to leave New-York to find a publisher for it. The History of the\r\nColonization of America--introductory to the History of the United\r\nStates--has secured for Mr. Bancroft a place among the greatest\r\nhistorians; he has now the assurance that he is writing for other ages;\r\nand he will not endanger his fame, nor fail of the utmost perfection in\r\nhis work, for any needless haste. This second part of his History will\r\nprobably occupy five volumes; and although the story has been written by\r\nmany hands, with more or less fulness and various degrees of justice,\r\nMr. Bancroft will have studied it from beginning to end in the original\r\nmaterials, of which his collection is by far the best that has ever been\r\nmade. If upon this field any one successfully competes with him for the\r\nhistoric wreath, he must come after him, and be guided by his light.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHENRY R.

SAMUEL JOHNSON, the father of the Protestant Episcopal Church in\r\nConnecticut, and the first President of King's College, now Columbia\r\nCollege, in New-York, was one of the most interesting characters in our\r\nsocial history. His abilities, learning, activity, and influence,\r\nentitle him to be ranked in the class of Franklin (who was his friend\r\nand correspondent, and who printed, at his press in Philadelphia,\r\nseveral of his works), as a promoter of the highest civilization in the\r\ncolonies. Except the Memoirs of Franklin, we have hitherto had no more\r\nattractive specimen of biography than the book known as Dr. Chandler's\r\nLife of Dr. Johnson. Franklin's Memoirs, it is well known, never came\r\nbefore the public in the form in which they were written, until a few\r\nyears ago, and it has lately been discovered that Dr. Johnson's had\r\nsuffered a similar disadvantage. Dr. Johnson amused himself in his old\r\nage by writing recollections of his life and times, which, after his\r\ndeath, were placed in the hands of Dr. Chandler, who changed them from\r\nthe first to the third person, omitted many particulars which he did not\r\ndeem it expedient to publish, and added others which the modesty of Dr.\r\nJohnson had not allowed him to write. The book thus made by Dr. Chandler\r\nwas printed by his son-in-law, the late Bishop Hobart, who probably was\r\nnot aware of its origin. But Dr. Johnson's MS. has now been discovered,\r\nand it will immediately be given to the public, under the supervision of\r\nthe Rev. Mr. Pitkin, of Connecticut, who is adding to it many notes and\r\nillustrative documents. It is very much to be regretted that so little\r\nof the extensive correspondence of Dr. Johnson with the chief persons of\r\nhis time in the literary and the religious world abroad, has been\r\npreserved; but the book will contain numerous letters by his more\r\neminent contemporaries which have not appeared elsewhere.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSomebody has made the \"discovery\" that General Charles Lee, of the\r\nrevolutionary army, was not unwilling to be considered the author of\r\n\"Junius;\" and two or three of our contemporaries have been busy with the\r\nsubject of the internal and other evidence in the case. These critics\r\nare about as wise as the editor of an evening paper who published one of\r\nthe old Washington forgeries, lately, as an important historical\r\ndocument. It was \"characteristic,\" that the chief wrote so familiarly to\r\nhis wife of affairs! In the same way, the history of the _Book of\r\nMormon_ (originally composed as a religious novel by the Rev. Solomon\r\nSpaulding), appears as a curious and altogether new exposure! We shall\r\nnot be surprised if the same journals advise us that Walter Scott wrote\r\nthe Waverley Novels.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEMILIE GIRARDIN has a new book _L'Abolition de la Misere_, in which he\r\nproposes the entire abolition of suffering.

The style of a fellow who talks of his\r\n\"fellow countrymen\" (not meaning, as the words do, persons who live with\r\nhim in rural neighborhoods), is scarcely deserving of criticism; but the\r\nsilliness of the falsehoods of this latest English traveller among us,\r\nmay be referred to as illustrating the causes of the common prejudices\r\nin England against the United States. After describing his arrival at\r\nthe Tremont House, in Boston, he says:\r\n\r\n     \"A clerk [meaning our old friend Parker], dressed in the height\r\n     of fashion, presided at the bar [meaning the office] at which\r\n     we applied for rooms, wherein to perform our duties of the\r\n     toilet. The one to which I was directed contained several beds\r\n     without curtains, from which the occupants had evidently but a\r\n     short time previously taken their departure. This was however a\r\n     matter of indifference, as I imagined the apartment would have\r\n     been entirely at my own disposal. In the course of a few\r\n     minutes however, the door was opened, and in walked an\r\n     individual, who, depositing a small carpet bag on the floor,\r\n     commenced operations of a similar nature to those I myself was\r\n     engaged in--not a word was at first exchanged between us; he\r\n     eyed me critically, I returned the compliment, till at length I\r\n     was favored with 'Stranger, I guess you are from Europe' (a\r\n     strong accent on the last syllable), immediately followed by\r\n     questions as to where I was going, what was my business, &c.\r\n     This was somewhat amusing, so I informed my gentleman I was\r\n     journeying to New-York, whereupon he told me I should see an\r\n     'almighty fine city.' His curiosity being next attracted by my\r\n     portmanteau, which was lying open on a chair, he strode up and\r\n     peered into it most attentively. Thinking I might as well\r\n     follow his example, I did the same by his carpet bag; whereupon\r\n     giving a grunt of dissatisfaction, he collected his valuables\r\n     and soon after took himself off.\"\r\n\r\nThirty years ago, the Duke of Saxe Weimar published a western story of a\r\ncoachman who said, \"I am the gentleman what's to drive you.\" Our very\r\noriginal _United Service_ tourist tells of a visit to Mount Auburn, and\r\nadds:\r\n\r\n     \"Whilst driving back to the hotel I happened to remark, 'That\r\n     is the _man_ who drove us from the steamer in the morning.'\r\n     Upon which 'Jehu' quickly replied, 'I reckon I'm the\r\n     _gentleman_ that drove you.' This information was received on\r\n     our part with all the respect due to the elevated rank of our\r\n     charioteer.\"\r\n\r\nIn a paragraph about luggage:\r\n\r\n     \"The American trunk is a ponderous solid affair made of wood,\r\n     secured with braces of iron, studded with brass or iron nails,\r\n     and usually having the name or initials of the owner, and\r\n     frequently the state of which he is a native, painted on it in\r\n     large white letters. Owing to this custom, the traveller is\r\n     liable to be addressed by any peculiarity appertaining to his\r\n     trunk being affixed thereto. Thus a gentleman passing through\r\n     the states, found himself designated as 'Mr. Air Tight,'\r\n     because this simple term was marked on the outside of a\r\n     tin-box, and no affirmations on his part could induce the\r\n     bystanders to believe to the contrary. They 'reckoned it was on\r\n     his box,' and that was sufficient.\"\r\n\r\nOf the personal appearance of the Americans:\r\n\r\n     \"To a stranger newly arrived from England, the absence of fresh\r\n     complexions and of bright and cheerful faces among the male\r\n     part of the creation is very striking. They are gaunt, sallow,\r\n     cadaverous looking creatures; their general, far from\r\n     prepossessing, appearance, in no way improved by the habit of\r\n     wearing long, straight hair, combed entirely off the face, the\r\n     bare throat, the never absent 'quid,' and that abominably nasty\r\n     habit of constant expectoration.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this trash is from one of the most reputable periodicals published\r\nin London--the one of all most especially addressed to _gentlemen_.\r\n\r\nIn the next number of his \"Reminiscences\" the author promises a sketch\r\nof the city of New-York, for which his authority will probably be Mrs.\r\nTrolloppe, Mr. Joseph Miller, and the last pick-pocket who went home to\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe \"Peace Congress,\" in which we have most faith--the only one that is\r\nlikely to exert any very desirable influence, is that to assemble next\r\nyear in Hyde Park. This will be a display of works rather than one of\r\nwords; and _apropos_ of its lingual character, which will show very\r\nconclusively that as yet \"all the nations of the earth\" are not \"as one\r\npeople,\" we find in _The Leader_ this paragraph:\r\n\r\n\"The Exhibition of 1851, seems to promise a whole literature of its own.\r\nJournals are already established for the record of its proceedings.\r\nUseful information will be at a premium--unless there should happen to\r\nbe a \"glut;\" while in the shape of translations and dialogue-books,\r\nevery facility will be offered to foreigners. What a Babel it will be!\r\nHow the English ear will be rasped by Slavonic and Teutonic gutturals,\r\nor distended by the breadth of Southern vowels. It will be a marvel if\r\nthis incursion of barbarians do not very much affect the purity of our\r\nown tongue, and damage the tender susceptibility of the London ear,\r\nalready so delicate that when an actor says--as it _sometimes_\r\nhappens--\"_Donnar Elvirar_ is coming,\" the whole audience rises in a\r\nmass to protest against the outrages on taste. We are told the Athenians\r\nwere also merciless critics in such matters. Nay, there is a famous\r\nanecdote perpetually cited as an illustration of Athenian delicacy in\r\nmatters of pronunciation, that Theophrastus was known to be a foreigner\r\neven by a herbseller. People who wonder at every thing recorded of the\r\nGreeks, will regard us probably as reckless iconoclasts if we break that\r\nby a stone flung from common sense; but really, with the daily\r\nexperience of Scotchmen and Irishmen before us, we must say the most\r\nwonderful part of the anecdote is, that it should have been recorded.\r\nTheophrastus came from Lesbos--if we remember rightly--and his\r\npronunciation, therefore, naturally preserved some of the Lesbian\r\nflavor, as Carlyle's does that of Annandale. Would any critic compliment\r\nthe cockney on delicacy of ear because it detects the accent of Carlyle,\r\nor Sheridan Knowles, to be other than its own true London accent? Yet,\r\nthis is precisely what critics do with respect to the Athenians.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMILTON, BURKE, MAZZINI, and DANIEL WEBSTER, present the most\r\nextraordinary examples of the harmonious and effective combination of\r\npolitical and literary genius, that have appeared in modern times. There\r\nhave been and there are now many politicians who are eminent as authors:\r\nbut these are preeminently great in both statesmanship and letters.\r\nMazzini is now the chief apostle of republicanism in Europe, as Milton\r\nwas in the time of the Protector. He devises and executes the schemes\r\nwhich promise advances of liberty and happiness, and he is equal to the\r\ndefence with the pen of every thing he essays in affairs. \"Young Italy,\"\r\nsince it was put down by French bayonets, has had as little quarter from\r\nparasite writers as from patristic governors; but Mazzini has come to\r\nher defence with as vigorous a pen as that with which Milton vindicated\r\nthe people of England against the hireling Salmasius, under similar\r\ncircumstances. In another part of this number of the _International_, we\r\nhave copied from the London _Examiner_ a reviewal of Mazzini's work on\r\nthe Italian revolution.

But now he has published a new book, on \"The\r\nDefenceless State of Great Britain,\" in which, the _Examiner_ says \"he\r\nhas made up for lost time.\" Says the critic, \"It is calculated to rouse\r\nall the old women in the country. Such a fee-fa-fum of a book we never\r\nread.

This\r\npromise was, that he would make no further change in the notes to the\r\nNew Testament, but reserve all additions for a separate supplementary\r\nwork. That work, after the direct labor of eleven years, is now\r\npublished; forming a companion to all the editions of Bloomfield's Greek\r\nTestament except the first two.

He has his whims, and though they have\r\nwon for him little popularity, we regret that they are not shared more\r\nlargely by the public, which will never appreciate his merits as a\r\ncensor, until the best features of our civilization are quite\r\nobliterated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR.

Art\r\n     exacts of its votaries no less service than a lifetime. But in\r\n     her girl's soul the right chord had been touched, which began\r\n     to vibrate into noble music, the true seed had been sown, which\r\n     day by day grew into a goodly plant. Vanbrugh had said truly,\r\n     that genius is of no sex; and he had said likewise truly, that\r\n     no woman can be an artist--that is, a great artist. The\r\n     hierarchies of the soul's dominion belong only to man, and it\r\n     is right they should. He it was whom God created first, let him\r\n     take pre-eminence. But among those stars of lesser glory, which\r\n     are given to lighten the nations, among sweet-voiced poets,\r\n     earnest prose writers, who, by lofty truth that lies hid\r\n     beneath legend and parable, purify the world, graceful painters\r\n     and beautiful musicians, each brightening their generation with\r\n     serene and holy lustre--among these, let woman shine! But her\r\n     sphere is, and ever must be, bounded; because, however lofty\r\n     her genius may be, it always dwells in a woman's breast.\r\n     Nature, which gave to man the dominion of the intellect, gave\r\n     to her that of the heart and affections. These bind her with\r\n     everlasting links from which she cannot free herself,--nay, she\r\n     would not if she could. Herein man has the advantage. He,\r\n     strong in his might of intellect, can make it his all in all,\r\n     his life's sole aim and guerdon. A Brutus, for that ambition\r\n     which is misnamed patriotism, can trample on all human ties. A\r\n     Michael Angelo can stand alone with his genius, and so go\r\n     sternly down into a desolate old age. But there scarce ever\r\n     lived the woman who would not rather sit meekly by her own\r\n     hearth, with her husband at her side, and her children at her\r\n     knee, than be the crowned Corinne of the Capitol.\r\n\r\n     \"Thus woman, seeking to strive with man, is made feebler by the\r\n     very spirit of love which in her own sphere is her chiefest\r\n     strength. But sometimes chance, or circumstance, or wrong,\r\n     sealing up her woman's nature, converts her into a\r\n     self-dependant human soul. Instead of life's sweetness, she has\r\n     before her life's greatness. The struggle passed, her genius\r\n     may lift itself upward, expand and grow mighty; never so mighty\r\n     as man's, but still great and glorious. Then, even while she\r\n     walks over the world's rough pathway, heaven's glory may rest\r\n     upon her up-turned brow, and she may become a light unto her\r\n     generation.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDAUTZENBERG, a Flemish poet, has issued at Brussels a volume of small\r\ncompositions, which, apart from freshness of fancy and beauty of\r\nthought, are remarkable for the correctness and smoothness of their\r\nform.

Her Lives of the Queens of Scotland,\r\nsoon to be issued from the press of the Harpers, resembles generally her\r\nformer work, by the success of which it was probably suggested, as much\r\nas by the desirableness of the biographies of the Northern Queens, as\r\n\"adjuncts\" to the lives of those of England. A good deal of matter was\r\ncollected in reference to the later Queens of Scotland during the\r\nbiographer's researches for the Queens of England; and this, augmented\r\nby further inquiries among public and private archives, especially among\r\nthe muniment-chests of noble Scottish families, forms the materials of\r\nthe present undertaking.

Dupont is as\r\nmuch a favorite with the people as Beranger, and though he does not\r\nequal the latter in originality of fancy and gayety of spirit, he even\r\nexcels him in revolutionary point and enthusiasm. His songs are heard in\r\nevery workshop and at every popular banquet, their words and music are\r\nuniversally familiar, and when the clubs were permitted, each meeting\r\nwas opened and closed with a song of Dupont's, the whole audience\r\njoining in the chorus. This was done instinctively and without previous\r\narrangement. It often happened, too, that after some orator had\r\ndelivered an ardent speech, Dupont would appear at the tribune with a\r\nnew song which he had composed on the inspiration of the moment. Now\r\neach new political event is sure of a response from this poet; one of\r\nhis late productions is the _Chant du Vote_ (vote song), in which he\r\ndenounces the attempt of the Government to destroy universal suffrage.\r\nPerhaps his most powerful production is the _Marsellaise of Hunger_; the\r\nhold this has taken on the public may be judged from the fact, that when\r\nat the theatre of the Porte St. Martin a piece was performed, called\r\n_Misery_, founded on incidents in the Irish famine, when the curtain\r\nwent down at the end of the first act, the beholders spontaneously set\r\nup this song. So in the same theatre, when the piece representing the\r\ndownfall of Rome was performed (this piece afterwards became famous\r\nthrough its prohibition by the Government), one of the spectators in the\r\npit began the chorus of Dupont's Soldier's Song:\r\n\r\n    \"Les peuples sont pour nous des freres\r\n    Et les tyrans des ennemis,\"\r\n\r\nthe whole house joined in, and the performance had to be interrupted\r\ntill the song was ended. The _Chant des Transportes_ wherever it is\r\nheard moves the people to tears and indignation. The Peasant's Song\r\nprophecies the time when independent industry shall render the earth\r\nblooming with fertility, and the corn and wine shall \"be free as warmth\r\nin summer weather.\" While the majority of his poems are political and\r\nsocial, some of them are full of love and appreciation of outward\r\nnature. In one, the Romance of the Poplar, this sentiment is finely\r\ncombined with the spirit of liberty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nARAGO'S great work, which was some time since announced in the\r\n_International_, is now nearly complete and will soon be given to the\r\npublic. The scientific and literary world of Europe expect it with\r\nimpatience. It is said even that Alexander von Humboldt intends to be\r\nits translator into German, but this is not probable. It is also rumored\r\nthat the author gives an appendix in which he for the moment abandons\r\nscience for politics, in order to pay off some of the attacks he has\r\nsuffered from Proudhon. Our own opinion is that he had better stick to\r\nhis trade and leave Proudhon alone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHARLES SUMNER has published (through Ticknor, Reed & Fields of Boston,)\r\ntwo volumes of his \"Orations and Addresses.\" Mr. Sumner is a scholar of\r\nthe finest and rarest capacities and accomplishments.

He enters heartily into all\r\nthe 'progressive' movements of the day, and is of many the intellectual\r\nleader. His bravery is equal to every emergency into which he may be led\r\nby a search after truth, and to all combats he brings arms of the truest\r\nmetal and most exquisite polish. There are in New-England many more\r\nfervid and powerful orators, but we know of none whose orations are\r\ndelivered with a more pleasing eloquence.

It consists of a writing-desk and\r\nalbum. The desk is of oak varnished, adorned with rich carving, and with\r\nlocks and the Bavarian arms in gilt bronze enamel. The carving contains\r\nthe most charming figures representing the various arts and trades. The\r\nalbum is bound in crimson velvet, the clasps and ornaments of gilt\r\nbronze. On the outside is a medallion, designed by Widnmann, set in\r\nbrilliants, representing King Louis surrounded by artists. A smaller\r\nmedallion stands in each corner, one representing architects with plans\r\nand models by Hautman; sculptors and bronze workers with the statue of\r\nBavaria, by Halbig; historic painters by Esseling; and landscape and\r\ngenre painters by Widnmann. Between the two upper medallions is a rich\r\nornament with the arms of the four tribes of Bavaria in enamel, and the\r\ninscription \"Louis I. King of Bavaria:\" between the lower medallions is\r\na similar ornament with \"The German Artists, A. D. 1850.\" All the\r\nornaments are in the old German style of the fifteenth century. In the\r\nAlbum are 177 sheets, each containing a contribution from some artist.\r\nThe title-page is by Esseling. Kaulbach has a drawing of unusual\r\nfreshness and beauty, representing the King calling to new life, at\r\nRome, the neglected art of Germany. But we have not space to speak of\r\nthe works of individual artists in this remarkable collection.

Sir Charles Eastlake is in some\r\nrespects a great painter, and he has produced many works which evince\r\nvery remarkable talents. Among the few pictures by him which evince\r\n_genius_, is that owned by Mr. Henry Carey Baird, of Philadelphia, of\r\n\"Hagar and Ishmael.\" He has done something in literature, and from his\r\nown account of himself we quote, that, like Haydon, he was born at\r\nPlymouth, a soil congenial to art, for in its environs was also the\r\nbirth-place of Sir Joshua Reynolds. Like Rembrandt, Reynolds, and so\r\nmany before them, Eastlake showed an early aversion to the Latin\r\nGrammar. He fled the Charter-house school; and a glimpse of Haydon's\r\npicture of \"The Dentatus,\" which was at that period exhibited at\r\nPlymouth, made him a painter. After studying in the Academy two years,\r\nunder Fuseli, he produced \"The Raising of Jairus's Daughter.\" This won\r\nhim a patron, in Mr. Harman, by whom he was commissioned to make studies\r\nof the miracles of art, at that time collected in the Louvre by\r\nNapoleon. Here also Lawrence, Haydon, Wilkie, and we believe Allston\r\nalso, came at this time to study. In the Louvre Eastlake made his first\r\nacquaintance with the wonders of Roman art. But the pleasant task of\r\ncopying these old masters was relinquished on the sudden return of\r\nNapoleon from Elba. At a not much later period, the fallen hero became\r\nhimself the subject of his pencil. Eastlake made a sketch of the\r\nex-Emperor as he appeared from the gangway of the Bellerophon, when at\r\nanchor in Plymouth roads, interesting as the last delineation of a noble\r\nvisage, then untinged with chagrin. In 1817 and 1819 he visited Italy\r\nand Greece, rather stirring up their living treasures than measuring\r\nantiquity with the inch rule of the archaeologist. Nor yet did Eastlake\r\nconfine himself to the external forms of art and nature; he then laid\r\nthe foundation of that intimate knowledge of the arts, be they called\r\nformative, architectural, plastic, or pictorial, the able elucidation of\r\nwhich renders his writings so valuable. Thus, whilst all the technical\r\nskill of ancient colorists is found in his style of painting, all the\r\nprinciples on which Dutch and Venetian masters proceeded are found in\r\nhis writings. Those who reflect on the unceasing labors of the Secretary\r\nof the Fine Art Commission, will be rather inclined to believe that the\r\ntitle of President was alone wanting to render Eastlake the legitimate\r\nleader of art in England. We need only mention his translation of\r\nGoeethe's \"Theory of Colors,\" the \"Notes to Kugler,\" and the \"Materials\r\nfor a History of Oil Painting.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNEW PICTURE BY KAULBACH. The King of Bavaria has ordered from Kaulbach a\r\npicture some twenty feet high, to represent the Apotheosis of a Good\r\nPrince. The lucky potentate is to be painted rising from the tomb, and\r\nconducted up to heaven by attending angels, where the Saviour, enthroned\r\nbetween the cherubim of Power and Justice, receives him with open arms.\r\nThe purple mantle and crown, the signs and adornments of earthly might,\r\nsink from the transfigured monarch upon the tomb, around which the Seven\r\nWorks of Mercy bear witness for him, while the Seven Deadly Sins lie\r\nunder the earth asleep and in chains. The idea of the composition was\r\nsuggested by the King. Kaulbach has advanced so far with its execution\r\nthat the cartoon is nearly completed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE ROYAL RUSSIAN PORCELAIN MANUFACTORY, at Berlin, is known over the\r\nworld for the elegance and excellence of its productions; most of the\r\nporcelain transparencies which are so common in all countries, and so\r\nmuch admired, are from this source. An honorary council has just been\r\nnamed to have the supervision of the artistic department of the\r\ninstitution. Among its members, are the eminent painter CORNELIUS, the\r\nsculptor RAUCH, and the architect HULER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. HEALEY, according to a letter by Mr. Walsh in the _Journal of\r\nCommerce_, is proceeding rapidly in Paris with his picture of the\r\nAmerican Senate, during the debate so famous for the passages between\r\nMr. Webster and Col. Hayne. Mr. Healey is said to be a very worthy\r\nperson, and it is to be regretted that his skill and genius are not\r\nequal to his morals, in which case we might not despair of his producing\r\na work not altogether unworthy of this subject. Some accident introduced\r\nMr. Healey to the late King of the French, who gave him various orders,\r\nthe reception of which was so noticed in the journals as to be of the\r\ngreatest possible advantage to him. He was suddenly elevated in the\r\ncommon opinion to the condition of the first rank of artists. But he is\r\nreally a painter of very ordinary capacities. We have probably some\r\nhundreds who are very much superior to him. It is impossible to point to\r\neven _one_ portrait by him that is remarkable for any excellence; and\r\nall his fame rests, rather than upon his productions, upon his having\r\nreceived orders from Louis Philippe. We remember the general surprise\r\nwith which groups of his portraits, displayed in the rotunda of the\r\ncapitol, were viewed by critics. The \"study\" of Daniel Webster, upon\r\nwhose every feature God has set the visible stamp of greatness, was\r\namong them, and it looked like the prim keeper of the accounts in a\r\nrespectable grocery-store. So of all the rest. Men sat to him from\r\ndeference to the wishes of the King, but every body felt that he was not\r\nan artist. Accidents and newspapers may confer a transient reputation,\r\nbut they can endow no one with abilities; and to espouse the cause of\r\nnewspapers against the cause of nature is a grievous wrong, in the end,\r\nto both newspapers and nature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAN ELEGANT work of much value to the students of modern art has lately\r\nappeared at Berlin, under the title of _Rimische Studien_ (Roman\r\nStudies), from the pen of VON KESTNER, a diplomatist by profession. The\r\nauthor, who by the way is a son of the famous CHARLOTTE, the heroine of\r\nGoeethe's \"Werther,\" dwells with the utmost partiality on these German\r\nartists, who have developed their talents by long and intimate\r\nacquaintance with Roman art, and who are now at work in the fatherland.\r\nTo the productions of \"Cornelius,\" he devotes a great deal of space. The\r\nspecial purpose of the work, as the author says in his preface, is to\r\nglorify Germany in the great creations of its artists.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE PHILHARMONIC SOCIETY of Paris, at one of its recent concerts, gave a\r\npiece of original Russian music, called the \"Song of the Cherubim,\" by\r\nBORTNIANSKY, a composer who has written a good deal for the Imperial\r\nChapel at St. Petersburg. It is a chorus without accompaniment, and is\r\nspoken of by the critics as most original and striking, in fact unlike\r\nany thing familiar to Western or Southern ears. We can easily conceive\r\nof a peculiar style of music being produced from the bosom of the Greek\r\nChurch. Those who have heard the melancholy and touching, half-barbaric\r\nmusic usually employed in its ritual, will not be surprised that out of\r\nit there should arise a quite new order of compositions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE GOeETHE'S INHERITANCE--an extensive collection of models, engravings,\r\nsculptures, carvings, gems, minerals, fossils, original drawings, &c.,\r\ncollected by the great poet,--is to be sold at Weimar, for the benefit\r\nof his heirs, two grandsons. A _catalogue raisonnee_ has been published\r\nby Fromman, at Jena, and it makes a very interesting book. It is\r\nsuggested in the _Art-Journal_ for December, that if the collection were\r\ndistributed in separate lots, in America, or England, or Germany, the\r\nheirs would realize three or four times as much as they will by a single\r\nsale for the whole, which they have determined upon. Letters upon the\r\nsubject may be addressed to Baron Walther Von Goethe, at Vienna.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe author of the following remarks on ART-UNIONS, is an eminent artist,\r\nwhose name has never been associated with any discussions of these\r\nInstitutions, or with any controversies connected with them, and he has\r\nnot, we believe, since the foundation of the first Art-Union in America,\r\nhad any production of his own in the market.\r\n\r\n\r\nART-UNIONS: THEIR TRUE CHARACTER CONSIDERED.\r\n\r\nART-UNIONS, and their management, have recently attracted much attention\r\nin this country, if we may judge from the numerous articles on the\r\nsubject which have appeared in some of the most reputable journals. It\r\nis now about ten years since the first Art-Union was established in this\r\ncity. Others, in various sections, have followed, and all, whatever\r\ntheir peculiarities, have been more or less successful in their chief\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nNow it is reasonable to suppose, that the result of these ten years'\r\nefforts to promote the cultivation of the Fine Arts among us, should\r\nfurnish some evidence of their capabilities for the accomplishment of so\r\nworthy and so great a work. The whole subject of their usefulness\r\nresolves itself into the following queries:\r\n\r\nI. Has any person of decided genius, who was unknown, friendless, and in\r\nneed, been sought out by them, assisted, encouraged, and at last added\r\nto the effective number of artists who are profitably employed among us?\r\n\r\nII. Have those artists who have received the larger share of the\r\npatronage of these institutions, shown by their works a corresponding\r\nadvance in the knowledge and love of excellence and truth in art?\r\n\r\nIII. Have they furnished any peculiar advantages to artists, as a body,\r\nby supplying the means of their improvement, in a free access to books,\r\ncasts, pictures, or good engravings?\r\n\r\nIV. Do Art-Unions promote the interests and reward the labors of those\r\nwho are most eminently deserving?\r\n\r\nV. Do they elevate the pursuit of art, in the minds of the people, and\r\nteach them its value, by distributing to them, in return for their\r\nsubscriptions, _only_ the best specimens which they can purchase from\r\nthe studios of our artists?\r\n\r\nVI. Are there a dozen well known artists who will openly testify to a\r\nconviction of their usefulness?\r\n\r\nIt is believed by many that an affirmative response cannot be given to\r\nthese questions; and if not, then the subject of their influence need be\r\nno longer discussed.\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention, nor my desire, to inquire into the _management_\r\nof these institutions. It is only at the system itself that I wish to\r\ndirect the attention of the reader. If it is proved that, as a system,\r\nthis is not calculated to elevate and enlarge the sphere of the arts,\r\nbut on the contrary, that its tendency is to degrade and stifle all that\r\nis lovely and desirable in their pursuit, then there will be no need of\r\ntroubling ourselves with the lower and baser subject of management; for\r\nthere is no bad system, which, by any method, can be managed into a good\r\none, and satisfy the just demands of those whose interests it professes\r\nto hold in its keeping.\r\n\r\nNumbers rather than quality seem to govern the Art-Unions in their\r\npurchases of works, that they may give to subscribers a greater number\r\nof _chances_ to draw something for their money, and thus encourage them\r\nto future _patronage_. This is the principle on which all lotteries\r\nlive: and when we come to sift the matter to the bottom, we cannot but\r\nacknowledge that Art-Unions are nothing else but lotteries, under\r\nanother and more popular name. Both exist ostensibly for the good of\r\nothers, who in reality are but the dupes of a most deceitful and vicious\r\nsystem, against which every good citizen should indignantly turn his\r\nface. It cannot be justly said in defence of Art-Unions, that they spend\r\nmore money for art than was ever done in the same period of time, nor\r\nthat they have distributed works amongst a class of people who never\r\nthought of giving money for such things before. They must first prove\r\nthat this great amount of money which they have collected, has been\r\nspent _judiciously_, for the benefit of deserving and meritorious\r\nartists, and that the works distributed are such as to elevate the\r\njudgment and enlarge the feelings in relation to art, among those who\r\nmay have received them.\r\n\r\nIt is for the interest of lotteries to offer some very large and\r\nvaluable prizes at the head of their list, to attract the attention of\r\nthe public, and thus to sell their tickets.\r\n\r\nSimilar means are adopted by Art-Unions to increase their subscription\r\nlists, which show that the system is _managed_ in the most efficient\r\nmanner. Those who can look back fifteen and twenty years, will remember\r\nthat our country was literally flooded with the bulletin boards of\r\nlotteries, printed in the most gaudy and attractive colors, showing a\r\nbrilliant schedule of prizes, and pledging almost certain wealth to all\r\nwho would venture their money on the \"grand scheme.\" They will also call\r\nto mind how many a victim there was to this deceptive and depraved\r\nsystem of legal fraud, until it became so injurious to the public\r\nmorals, that Legislatures were forced to hurl the bolts of the law\r\nagainst them, in all parts of the United States, and so put an end to\r\ntheir iniquity. Lotteries have been justly prohibited by wise\r\ngovernments, because they attract men from legitimate pursuits, into the\r\nspeculative, uncertain, and, morally, illegitimate pursuit of fortune.\r\nThe case is similar in its results to that of Art-Unions. They attract\r\nmany from a calling for which their talents have fitted them, into a\r\nsphere so much above their natural powers, that they must in time fall\r\nback, victims to vanity and love of gain, into a lower plane of life\r\nperhaps, than that they once happily occupied. The effect of these\r\nUnions is seen rather in the great number of persons of mediocre\r\nabilities they have _encouraged_ to enter upon the cultivation of art,\r\nthan in the bringing forth greater powers and excellence in those whose\r\nundoubted genius is apparent to the world.\r\n\r\nIt was remarked by Carlyle, that our modern intellect is of the spavined\r\nkind, \"all action and no go;\" and so it appears to be in regard to the\r\nefforts that are being made to \"promote the interests of art,\" in this\r\ncountry. Art-Unions have been active enough, for many years, and have\r\npossessed themselves of hundreds of thousands of dollars, and yet it is\r\n\"no go;\" the interests of art still lie gasping, without much hope of a\r\nchange for the better. There is a great display made every year in the\r\n\"distribution of prizes,\" and every means used to gain public\r\nconfidence, by holding up the names of the most respectable citizens as\r\nguarantees that nothing under their control can go wrong; and by issuing\r\nbulletins in which is proved, by figures, the flourishing state of the\r\ninstitution, and consequently of the beautiful arts; yet in spite of all\r\nthis, the great mass of common-sense minds and of true lovers of art,\r\nheretics that they are, go away and exclaim, \"Well, after all it's 'no\r\ngo,' the works distributed are no better than those of last year, and we\r\nare really afraid there are no hopes for the arts in this country, so\r\nlong as no other plan is adopted for their improvement.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the petty states in Germany and in southern Europe obtain a\r\nlarge revenue from lotteries, which are entirely under the control of\r\nthe crown, and are hence commonly called \"Royal,\" or \"Imperial.\" The\r\nprizes are comparatively small, but the tickets are fixed at such a very\r\nlow sum, say from ten to twenty cents, that they come within the reach\r\nof the poorest inhabitants. The consequence is that nearly all persons\r\nwho are ignorant of the scheme which the Government has laid to tax\r\nthem, spend more or less every year for lottery tickets. We have known\r\npersons who, under the excitement produced by these plans for rapidly\r\ngaining fortunes, have pawned the last blanket from their beds, to\r\nobtain the means of purchasing a ticket. At every drawing of these\r\n\"Imperial\" lotteries, there is nothing left undone by Royalty to strike\r\nthe people with a sense of their importance, and the honesty with which\r\nthey are conducted. In an open square is erected a kind of stage large\r\nenough to be occupied by some twenty persons. Rich canopies of scarlet\r\nand gold overhang it, and above all are figures of Justice, Plenty,\r\nVirtue, &c. &c. The \"Royal\" band of music is stationed near, and amidst\r\nits enlivening tones, holding in silence many thousands of anxious\r\nhearts, the cortege, preceded by Royalty itself, ascends, and is seated\r\nin the order of its dignity. In front of the throne are placed, upon\r\npedestals, two large revolving globes half filled with tickets, and by\r\nthe side of each stands a page, in magnificent costume, blindfolded.\r\nThen commences the distribution of the prizes, in the usual way, by\r\ndrawing numbers from the globes, by the hands of the pages, which are\r\nannounced from the throne, and so along to the ears of the most distant\r\nin the multitude. At intervals, the drawing ceases, while most charming\r\nmusic serves to keep the crowd together, and possibly to drive for the\r\nmoment, from many a heart, the pangs of disappointment or despair. Now\r\nthere is some excuse for ignorance on this subject, among those poor\r\npeople, for there are no means by which they can be enlightened and\r\nwarned of the evil. But in this country, where the press is free, and\r\nthe means of information abundant, it would be sad to reflect that such\r\nthings can, under any name or phrase, long continue unmasked and unshorn\r\nof their power.\r\n\r\nThere is consolation in the belief, that however prosperous this species\r\nof gaming may be, the time is not far distant when its true character\r\nand tendency will be made manifest; and when the unseen but certain\r\noperations of the moral sense of our people will put an end to its\r\ninglorious career; if not directly, through the action of the laws, yet\r\nindirectly, by withholding the necessary contributions to its further\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nThis parallel between Art-Unions and Lotteries is drawn that the\r\ncharacter of the former may be more readily comprehended by the reader.\r\n\r\nIn the recent drawing of the American Art-Union there were distributed\r\n_one thousand works of art_, making about one prize to sixteen blanks.\r\nBut where did all these \"thousand works\" come from? and what are they?\r\nHave they all been executed by living American artists? Are they\r\npaintings, or sculptures, or engravings, purchased from the artists who\r\nmade them, and who have received an adequate price for them? We know\r\nfrom their advertisement that _sixty_ of them are \"impressions from the\r\nlarge engravings after Col. Trumbull's pictures of the _Battle of Bunker\r\nHill_ and the _Death of Montgomery_.\" Now the purchase of these\r\nengravings from the pictures of a long deceased painter can be of no\r\npossible service to the painters living and laboring among us, nor to\r\nthe progress of art in any way. As well might the Art-Union purchase for\r\ndistribution sixty copies of Dunlap's History of the Arts of Design, or\r\nof Allston's Lectures on Art, or any object pertaining to the subject\r\nthat may be procured at any time of the book or print sellers. It is\r\ntrue, they must manage to offer a number of small prizes, the best way\r\nthey can, that they may in some plausible way meet the expectations of\r\ntheir very extended lists of subscribers, to which, it seems, they never\r\nattempt to set a limit. Here is another proof that they are mere\r\nspeculators upon the labors of artists, and only seek to enlarge their\r\nsubscriptions, and usurp a power and control over the great body of\r\nartists, which should never, with their consent, be allowed to any, no\r\nmatter how respectable, body of men.\r\n\r\nLet us turn to the \"_Western Art-Union_.\" Having but few good prizes to\r\noffer, nothing indeed which would ensure them a large subscription list,\r\nit became necessary to procure some well known production for this\r\npurpose, as a capital prize. The managers therefore negotiated, in a\r\nvery quiet manner, with a Mr. Robb, of New Orleans, for one of HIRAM\r\nPOWERS'S finest statues, the \"_Greek Slave_,\" then in the possession of\r\nMr. Robb, and it was accordingly taken to Cincinnati, and placed on\r\nexhibition in the Art-Union, as one of the prizes to be distributed this\r\nyear. Handbills were then sent over the United States announcing this\r\nfact. Of course, with such a celebrated work as this, thousands would be\r\nseduced to purchase a ticket, and thus place the _Art-Union_ in a most\r\nflourishing condition, and probably secure to it at least double the sum\r\nwhich it had paid, or the sculptor had originally received, for the\r\nstatue.\r\n\r\nNow let us consider this transaction in its true light. The Art-Union\r\nwas established solely for the purpose of benefiting artists, protecting\r\ntheir interests, and increasing the knowledge of art among the people.\r\nFrom these facts it is evident that neither of these purposes were kept\r\nin view or carried out. Instead of negotiating with the sculptor himself\r\nfor one of his works, and giving him a liberal price for it, they never\r\nmentioned the subject to him, but secretly purchased one of another\r\nperson--a rich man, who was in nowise whatever connected with the arts.\r\n\r\nOne would have supposed that even if there were very strong inducements\r\nto such a procedure on the part of this institution, for the sake of\r\ngain, still that a friendly feeling towards the great sculptor, of whom\r\nthe Queen City is so proud, and a due regard for his interests and his\r\nfame, would have prevented the consummation of such an act. It can be\r\nno pleasing reflection to Mr. Powers, that a work which many persons in\r\nEurope, as well as in America, would have purchased at any reasonable\r\nprice, should, by any movement of his own townsmen, be disposed of at a\r\npublic raffle, so that of its final destination he must long remain in\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\nIt seems, from what has here been adduced, that Art-Unions have not\r\nproved of service to art or artists, notwithstanding the immense amount\r\nannually collected for this ostensible purpose; but that they are in\r\nreality only lotteries operating under another but less objectionable\r\nname.\r\n\r\nIf a corporation can be granted by the Legislature, with the privilege\r\nof selling pictures, or statuary, by lottery, every other branch of\r\nindustry is as much entitled to such a privilege, or our laws are\r\nonesided and unjust. We would then see distributions of prizes from\r\nevery quarter, until the whole mechanical and commercial interests of\r\nthe country would be turned into Lotteries or Unions. Following the\r\nexample of the Art-Union in this state, we have already advertised a\r\n\"_Homestead Art-Union_,\" the grand prize of which is a \"house and lot\r\nsituated in Williamsburgh, which cost nearly $5,000.\" Subscribers are\r\nentitled to \"an elegant and valuable engraving, which has heretofore\r\nsold at $7.50, (being $2.50 more than the price of subscription,) and\r\nsuperior in execution and elegance to any picture distributed in this\r\nmanner.\" It has in its collection for distribution \"ninety-nine elegant\r\nand costly oil paintings and engravings, richly framed in ornamental and\r\nplain gilt frames.\" All the difference between these Unions, seems to be\r\nin the fact that the \"Homestead\" has limited the number of\r\ntickets--certainly an improvement on the other, so far as the public\r\ninterest is concerned. We may expect to hear very soon of _Bread and\r\nMeat Art-Unions_, when the whole community, for a very small outlay, may\r\nlive like princes, and snap their fingers at haggard want.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of these hotbed methods of cultivating an appreciation of\r\nart and of rewarding its professors, has been to discourage artists from\r\nany suitable efforts to provide instruction, upon a liberal scale, to\r\nthose who are seeking for it. Indeed it takes from them the power to do\r\nso, by drawing away funds necessary to such an object, which, but for\r\nthese grand schemes, would be likely to come into their hands. One has\r\nbut to observe the motives which induce persons to subscribe to an\r\nArt-Union, to be convinced that the great majority do so for the sake of\r\nself-aggrandizement, that is, to have a chance of getting the works of\r\nour best artists for a mere tithe of their value, or in the language of\r\nthe advertisements, \"of obtaining a valuable return, for a small\r\ninvestment;\" as they would buy any other lottery tickets: to make the\r\nmost out of their money. But there are many who subscribe from nobler\r\nmotives--real lovers of art, whose only object is to lend a helping hand\r\nto its interests, and to show a generous sympathy in the struggles and\r\nself-denying endeavors of all whose souls are so wrapt up in its pursuit\r\nthat they scarcely arrive at the knowledge requisite to a charge of\r\ntheir own pecuniary and worldly affairs. This latter class of\r\nsubscribers believe they are gratifying this genuine love of the\r\nbeautiful and good, when they give annually their five dollars to an\r\ninstitution chartered for the express design of protecting and\r\ncherishing the interests of art, and of enlarging the field of its\r\nlabors and usefulness among the people. These genuine _patrons_ give,\r\nwithout a hope or thought of drawing a prize, or receiving in any shape\r\na return for their subscriptions. Did they reflect upon, or know, that\r\nthese funds were worse than misapplied, they would withhold them, and\r\nseek in some other way to make a proper appropriation of them.\r\n\r\nWe have said that these Art-Unions prevent artists from taking any steps\r\nto provide the means of instruction for those who need and seek it. As\r\nan illustration of this we may mention the present state of the\r\n_National Academy of Design_. It is, and has been for two or three\r\nyears, quite prostrate for want of funds; its schools have been closed,\r\nand without assistance it must soon die. A few years ago it was in a\r\nflourishing state, and offered the advantages of study which their fine\r\ncollection of casts from the best antique statues, and a small but well\r\nselected and growing library could afford to students. Such have been\r\nthe results of Art-Unions upon schools of art everywhere. To be sure the\r\nmembers of the National Academy are not entirely free from censure in\r\nthis matter, for many of them, smitten with the \"Union\" mania, gave it\r\ntheir countenance, and even something more substantial, to assist its\r\ninfant struggles for popularity, little suspecting, certainly, that they\r\nwere lending a club which would sooner or later strike them to the\r\nground. It may not be out of place here to remark, that it is firmly\r\nbelieved that the Academy of Design can yet rise up from its ashes, and\r\noverthrow all such schemes as Art-Unions, by placing itself upon a more\r\nliberal and popular footing; and by disclaiming all exclusive titles as\r\nutterly unworthy the ambition of every sensible and right-feeling\r\nartist. Institutions in this country, to be useful, must be placed on a\r\npopular foundation; and to be popular, they must rest upon the broad\r\nrepublican principle of equal rights and equal privileges to all. Let\r\nthe members of the Academy open their doors wide enough to admit all\r\nclasses of artisans who desire to study the principles of design--the\r\nbasis upon which the beauty and the saleability of their works mainly\r\ndepends. There might then, in addition to the sections of Painting and\r\nSculpture, be added those of Architecture, Ornamental Marble and Stone\r\nWorkers, Carvers in Wood and Metal, Gold and Silver Smiths, Cabinet\r\nMakers, and indeed, as many other occupations as chose to unite\r\nthemselves, in separate sections, for the purposes of mutual instruction\r\nin the Art of Design. This would at once be practical and popular, and\r\nwith such objects in view, the Academy could with very little additional\r\nfunds be put into immediate and successful operation, and become a\r\nhighly honorable and most useful institution. These are mere\r\nsuggestions, thrown out for the consideration of the members of the\r\nAcademy and others interested. This is not the proper place to enlarge\r\nupon such a subject.\r\n\r\nArtists must learn, if they do not know, how to control their own\r\naffairs, and if they are determined to succeed, they must not think of\r\ntrusting their interests to the keeping of those not of their\r\nprofession, and entirely uneducated in art, and who consequently cannot\r\nbe qualified to discharge so delicate a duty with judgment and fidelity.\r\nIt is an old saying, but very applicable to the present instance, that\r\n\"if you neglect your own business, you need not expect others to attend\r\nto it for you.\" Let artists depend more upon private sales of their\r\nworks to those who can appreciate them for a just remuneration, than\r\nupon the deceptive offers which chartered schemes may hold out to them.\r\nThey will then, by their worth and their artistic merits, build up about\r\nthem a solid body of friends and patrons, of whom nothing but death\r\nitself can rob them; and the number of whom time will but increase,\r\nuntil they may look forward with well-founded hopes to a peaceful and\r\nhonorable old age, and a full reward for all their labors. They cannot\r\njustly suppose that permanent success and a distinguished name can be\r\nattained through any other channel than by honesty, and excellence in\r\ntheir works. Honors and rewards from private sources may be very laggard\r\nin their approach, but they must ultimately come--especially in this\r\nenlightened, progressive, and prosperous country--to those who have\r\nfairly earned them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecent Deaths.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who have been accustomed to visit the bookstore of Bartlett &\r\nWelford, under the Astor House, during the last half-dozen years, must\r\nhave been familiar with the commanding figure and gentle but uneasy\r\nexpression of our late excellent friend, the Rev. SERENO E. DWIGHT, D.\r\nD., who died in Philadelphia on the thirtieth of November, in the\r\nsixty-fourth year of his age. Dr. Dwight was born in Greenfield,\r\nConnecticut, in 1786, and was educated at Yale College, where he was\r\ngraduated in 1803, being then about seventeen years of age. He became a\r\ntutor in the college, but soon abandoned this occupation to commence the\r\nstudy of the law at Burlington in Vermont, and in a few years he was\r\nadmitted to practice in the highest courts of the country. An early and\r\never-increasing predilection, however, led him to the profession of his\r\nfather, and upon completing his theological studies he was settled over\r\nthe Park-street Congregational church, in Boston, where, he rapidly\r\nacquired the fame of being one of the ablest, most eloquent, and most\r\nuseful divines in New-England.\r\n\r\nHe had contracted a cutaneous disease, from the injudicious use of\r\ncalomel, while a tutor in Yale College; and its effects increased so\r\nmuch now, that his parishioners, who had become quite attached to him,\r\nin 1825 induced him to undertake a voyage to Europe. A year's travel, in\r\nGreat Britain, Germany, France, and other countries, failed to restore\r\nhis health, and soon after his return to the United States he resigned\r\nhis charge of the Park-street church, and undertook the Presidency of\r\nHamilton College, which in turn he was compelled to surrender, and in\r\n1830 he opened, at New-Haven, an Academy, in which he was assisted by\r\nhis wife, a daughter of the late Judge Daggett. The decline of Mrs.\r\nDwight's health, and other circumstances, induced him to relinquish the\r\nbusiness of teaching; he visited the Southern States, was during several\r\nsessions chaplain to the United States Senate, and, devoting himself to\r\nliterature, wrote an elaborate memoir of his great-grandfather, Jonathan\r\nEdwards, and several works of less importance, one of which was \"The\r\nHebrew Wife,\" written to illustrate the Jewish laws of marriage, and\r\npublished in New-York in 1836.\r\n\r\nThe death of his wife, and increasing physical infirmities, led him to\r\nadopt a habit of the utmost seclusion in New-York, where he passed\r\nnearly all the residue of his life. His last appearance in public was in\r\nthe summer of 1848, when he consented to act with Mr. John R. Bartlett\r\n(now the chief of the Mexican Boundary Commission) and the writer of\r\nthese paragraphs, as an examiner of one of the departments of the\r\nRutgers Female Institute. He died suddenly, while upon a visit to\r\nPhiladelphia for the purpose of trying the effect of the hydropathic\r\ntreatment of his disease, on the 30th of September. In the _Home\r\nJournal_ of December 14, Mr. Willis says of him:--\r\n\r\n     \"In the death of this excellent man we have lost a friend,\r\n     whose loss to ourself we most sincerely mourn, though the grave\r\n     was, to him, a welcome relief from an insufferable disease,\r\n     that had made life wretched for years. Mr. Dwight was the son\r\n     of Rev. Dr. Dwight, President of Yale College. He became pastor\r\n     of Park-st. church, in Boston, while we attended it in boyhood,\r\n     and it is our pride to record that we were so fortunate as to\r\n     secure his friendship at that time, and to retain it, in\r\n     undiminished warmth and kindness, to the day of his death. Mr.\r\n     Dwight was a man of qualities unusual in his profession. When\r\n     he first came to Boston, in perfect health, he was, in personal\r\n     appearance, the ideal of a high-souled and faultlessly elegant\r\n     gentleman--with more of manly and refined beauty, indeed, than\r\n     we remember to have combined in any other man. He wore these\r\n     winning gifts most unconsciously, being beloved by the humblest\r\n     for his open and accessible simplicity and kindness: and his\r\n     health first gave way under the laborious discharge of his\r\n     parochial duties. He was too severely critical and polished a\r\n     scholar to be either a very eloquent preacher or an easy\r\n     writer, but his sermons were models of purity of style, study,\r\n     and elevated thought, and his pastoral intercourse and counsel\r\n     were too delightful ever to be forgotten by those who enjoyed\r\n     it. Sent to Europe for his health, by his congregation, Mr.\r\n     Dwight was received and followed with a degree of enthusiastic\r\n     and flattering attention which fully confirmed his mark as a\r\n     man, and showed how Nature's noblemen are recognized and\r\n     honored everywhere. He resumed his duties on his return, but\r\n     was soon obliged by illness to relinquish them, and, from that\r\n     time forward, he was never again well. His weakness took the\r\n     shape of a cutaneous disease of the most irritating and\r\n     incurable form, and though he made one or two attempts at\r\n     re-commencing his usefulness, it was sadly in vain. He resided\r\n     secludedly in New-York during the latter years of his life,\r\n     giving to books and scholarship what mind he could withdraw\r\n     from pain, and, even thus, ready always with kindness and\r\n     delightful earnestness, to give counsel or sympathy to those he\r\n     loved. Mr. Dwight was a martyr to that great wrong of our\r\n     country toward all clergymen--to express it by a common saying,\r\n     \"the working a free horse to death\"--and we have only to look\r\n     at the pale faces, the stooping chests, and the slender frames\r\n     of most of our clerical men, to see how mind, patience,\r\n     attention, needful leisure and more needful sleep, are cruelly\r\n     overdrawn upon, by the service expected of them. But for his\r\n     share of suffering by this exacting system, Mr. Dwight might\r\n     have been, for years to come, the ornament and pride to his\r\n     country which his unequalled combination of fine gifts\r\n     qualified him to be; and we should not mourn, as we now do,\r\n     over his life embittered while it lasted, and sent to the grave\r\n     in what might have been its meridian of usefulness and\r\n     ornament.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOUNT BRANDENBURGH, the Prussian Prime Minister, died on the 6th\r\nNovember at Berlin. He was a natural brother of the late King of\r\nPrussia, being the illegitimate son of the present King's grandfather,\r\nby the Countess Doenhoff Frederichstein, and was acknowledged, educated,\r\nand admitted as such, by the Prussian Royal family, by whom he was\r\ninvariably treated as a friend and relative, although not with royal\r\nhonors. He was born on the 23d of January, 1792, and had nearly\r\ncompleted his 59th year. He was educated for the military profession and\r\nentered the service in 1807; his promotion continued regularly, and in\r\n1812 he was a captain on the staff of General Von York, under whom he\r\nsaw some service. In 1813 he became major, and in that rank took part in\r\nthe numerous actions between the Prussian and the French armies,\r\nincluding the battles of Leipsic, and Bautzen, Brienne, Laon, and Paris.\r\nAt the passage of the Rhine at Caub, Count Brandenburgh was the first\r\nwho reached the French bank. For his good conduct at Mokern and\r\nWartenburg, he received the Iron Cross of the first class. In 1814 he\r\nwas made lieutenant-colonel. In 1816 he received the command of the\r\nregiment in which he first entered the service. From 1816 to 1846 he\r\nreceived various promotions, charges, and decorations. In 1848 he was\r\nmade general in command of the 8th army corps. Up to this time he had\r\ntaken no part in politics. The London _Times_ says:\r\n\r\n     \"It was in the midst of those scenes of anarchy and violence\r\n     which, about two years ago, had shaken the Prussian monarchy to\r\n     its foundations--when a furious Assembly, beleaguered and\r\n     intimidated by a more furious mob, had usurped sovereign power\r\n     in the capital, and a democratic constitution was all but\r\n     grafted on the military throne of Frederic the Great,--that we\r\n     remember to have exclaimed, in the wonder and the dread of that\r\n     terrible period, \"Will no one save the house of Hohenzollern?\"\r\n     The state seemed to be on the brink of a cataract, and even the\r\n     leaders of the popular movement were ignorant of the dark and\r\n     stormy course before them. At that moment, it was announced one\r\n     morning, to the amazement of the Prussians and of Europe, that\r\n     an elderly gentleman, who had never taken any active part in\r\n     politics, but had lived in the most exclusive circles of the\r\n     aristocracy, and the Prussian Guards, was about to enter on the\r\n     task which the boldest men had found beyond their courage, and\r\n     the ablest beyond their capacity. But though he laid small\r\n     claim to skill in political tactics, or experience in the\r\n     administration of affairs, Count Brandenburgh brought to the\r\n     service of his sovereign precisely those plain qualities which\r\n     no one else appeared to possess. He had sense, he had firmness,\r\n     he absolutely contemned the storm of unpopularity which greeted\r\n     his appointment, and he proceeded to conduct the Government\r\n     with full confidence that, although his countrymen were\r\n     peculiarly subject to fits of enthusiasm, they respect nothing\r\n     so much in the long run as a clear will and definite authority.\r\n     After about fifteen months the citizens of Berlin hailed Count\r\n     Brandenburgh as the saviour of his country.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGEORGE GRENVILLE, LORD NUGENT, died on the 26th of November at Lillies,\r\nnear Aylesbury, aged sixty-one. He was the second son of the Marquis of\r\nRockingham, and inherited the Irish Barony of Nugent, on the death of\r\nhis mother, in 1812. During the same year he was elected M. P. for\r\nAylesbury, and continued to represent that borough on the Liberal\r\ninterest, until 1832, when he was appointed Lord High Commissioner of\r\nthe Ionian Isles. He held that office until 1836, when he returned to\r\nEngland. In 1847 he was re-elected for Aylesbury. He enjoyed a very fair\r\nliterary reputation. He was the author of \"Lands, Classical and Sacred,\"\r\n\"Memorials of Hampden,\" and other interesting productions. In\r\nconjunction with Lady Nugent, he also brought out the popular \"Legends\r\nof the Library at Lillies.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. ALEXANDRE FRAGONARD, the eminent French painter and sculptor, died in\r\nOctober. He was a pupil of David. As a statuary, his great work is the\r\nfrontispiece of the old Chamber of Deputies; and, as a painter, he\r\nexecuted several fine pieces, amongst others a ceiling of the Louvre,\r\nrepresenting Tasso reading his \"Jerusalem.\" His chief works were\r\nengraved in 1840.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. JOSEPH DROZ, a member of the French Institute, died in Paris in\r\nNovember. The youth of M. Droz was devoted to stormier occupations than\r\nthat in which he gathered the laurels now laid upon his grave. For three\r\nyears he was a soldier:--for upwards of fifty he has been devoted to\r\nletters and to philosophy. His last escort was composed of the men who\r\nhad been his comrades in that latter field,--and over his grave MM.\r\nGuizot and Bartholemy Saint-Hilaire, pronounced eulogies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR SCHORN, died in Augsburgh on the 7th of October, at the\r\npremature age of forty-seven years. In the formation of the Munich\r\nGallery, he was the most trusted and active emissary, and traversed\r\nconsiderable portions of Europe, including England and Italy, in search\r\nof those treasures which now enrich this famous gallery. When in London,\r\nhis companion was Von Martins, the eminent Brazilian traveller and\r\nnaturalist.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGUSTAVE SCHWAB, one of the most popular poets of Germany, died at\r\nStuttgart on the 4th of November, aged fifty-eight. Schwab was the\r\nfriend of Uhland. His death was very sudden. On the morning of the day\r\non which he was summoned, he had entertained a party of his friends at\r\nbreakfast, and read to them passages of a translation into German verse,\r\nwhich he was making of the poetical works of M. de Lamartine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpirit of the English Annuals.\r\n\r\nNEW TALES BY THACKERAY, BULWER, MRS. HALL, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe holiday souvenirs for the present season are less numerous in\r\nEngland, as in this country, than in some previous years; but the\r\n_Keepsake_, edited formerly by Lady Blessington, and now by her niece,\r\nMiss Power, is among the few favorite annuals that are continued, and it\r\nis as good as in its best days. We quote several of its chief\r\nattractions, and first\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLTIGUER:\r\n\r\nBY THE AUTHOR OF THE \"HISTORY OF PENDENNIS.\"\r\n\r\nThere arose out of the last Epsom races a little family perplexity,\r\nwhereon the owner of Voltiguer little speculated: and as out of this\r\napparently trivial circumstance a profound and useful moral may be\r\ndrawn, to be applied by the polite reader; and as Epsom Races will\r\ninfallibly happen next year, and, I dare say, for many succeeding\r\ngenerations; perhaps the moral which this brief story points had better\r\nbe printed upon Dorling's next \"Correct Card,\" as a warning to future\r\npatrons and patronesses of the turf.\r\n\r\nThis moral, then--this text of our sermon, is, NEVER----but we will keep\r\nthe moral, if you please, for the end of the fable.\r\n\r\nIt happened, then, that among the parties who were collected on the Hill\r\nto see the race, the carriage of a gentleman, whom we shall call Sir\r\nJoseph Raikes, occupied a commanding position, and attracted a great\r\ndeal of attention amongst the gentlemen sportsmen. Those bucks upon the\r\nground who were not acquainted with the fair occupant of that\r\ncarriage--as indeed, how should many thousands of them be?--some being\r\nshabby bucks; some being vulgar bucks; some being hot and unpleasant\r\nbucks, smoking bad cigars, and only staring into Lady Raikes's carriage\r\nby that right which allows one Briton to look at another Briton, and a\r\ncat to look at a king;--of those bucks, I say, who, not knowing Lady\r\nRaikes, yet came and looked at her, there was scarce one that did not\r\nadmire her, and envy the lucky rogue her husband. Of those ladies who,\r\nin their walks from their own vehicles, passed her ladyship's, there was\r\nscarce one lady in society who did not say, \"is that all?--is that the\r\nbeauty you are all talking about so much? She is overrated; she looks\r\nstupid; she is over-dressed; she squints;\" and so forth; whilst of the\r\nmen who _did_ happen to have the honor of an acquaintance with Lady\r\nRaikes and her husband (and many a man, who had thought Raikes rather\r\nstupid in his bachelor days, was glad enough to know him now), each as\r\nhe came to the carriage, and partook of the excellent luncheon provided\r\nthere, had the most fascinating grins and ogles for the lady, and the\r\nmost triumphant glances for all the rest of the world,--glances which\r\nseemed to say, \"Look, you rascals, I know Lady Raikes; you don't know\r\nLady Raikes. I can drink a glass of champagne to Lady Raikes's health.\r\nWhat would you give, you dog, to have such a sweet smile from Lady\r\nRaikes? Did you ever see such eyes? did you ever see such a complexion?\r\ndid you ever see such a killing pink dress, and such a dear little\r\ndelightfully carved ivory parasol?\"--Raikes had it carved for her last\r\nyear at Baden, when they were on their wedding-trip. It has their coats\r\nof arms and their ciphers intertwined elegantly round the stalk--a J and\r\na Z; her name is Zuleika; before she was married she was Zuleika\r\nTrotter. Her elder sister, Medora, married Lord T--mn--ddy; her younger,\r\nHaidee, is engaged to the eldest son of the second son of a noble D-ke.\r\nThe Trotters are of a good family. Dolly Trotter, Zuleika's brother, was\r\nin the same regiment (and that, I need not say, an extremely heavy one)\r\nwith Sir Joseph Raikes.\r\n\r\nHe did not call himself Joseph then: quite the contrary. Larkyn Raikes,\r\nbefore his marriage, was one of the wildest and most irregular of our\r\nBritish youth. Let us not allude--he would blush to hear them--to the\r\nparticulars of his past career. He turned away his servant for screwing\r\nup one of the knockers which he had removed during the period of his own\r\nbachelorhood, from an eminent physician's house in Saville Row, on the\r\nhousekeeper's door at Larkyn Hall. There are whole hampers of those\r\nknockers stowed away somewhere, and snuff-taking Highlanders, and tin\r\nhats, and black boys,--the trophies of his youth, which Raikes would\r\nlike to send back to their owners, did he know them; and when he carried\r\noff these spoils of war he was not always likely to know. When he goes\r\nto the Bayonet and Anchor Club now (and he dined there twice during Lady\r\nRaikes's ... in fine, when there was no dinner at home), the butler\r\nbrings him a half-pint of sherry and a large bottle of Seltzer water,\r\nand looks at him with a sigh, and wonders--\"Is this Captain Raikes, as\r\nused to breakfast off pale hale at three, to take his regular two\r\nbottles at dinner, and to drink brandy and water in the smoking\r\nbilliard-room all night till all was blue?\" Yes, it is the same Raikes;\r\nLarkyn no more--riotous no more--brandivorous no longer. He gave away\r\nall his cigars at his marriage; quite unlike Screwby, who also married\r\nthe other day, and offered to _sell_ me some. He has not betted at a\r\nrace since his father paid his debts and forgave him, just before the\r\nold gentleman died and Raikes came into his kingdom. Upon that\r\naccession, Zuleika Trotter, who looked rather sweetly upon Bob Vincent\r\nbefore, was so much touched by Sir Joseph Raikes's determination to\r\nreform, that she dismissed Bob and became Lady Raikes.\r\n\r\nDolly Trotter still remains in the Paddington Dragoons; Dolly is still\r\nunmarried; Dolly smokes still; Dolly owes money still. And though his\r\nvenerable father, Rear-admiral Sir Ajax Trotter, K.C.B., has paid his\r\ndebts many times, and swears if he ever hears of Dolly betting again, he\r\nwill disinherit his son, Dolly--the undutiful Dolly--goes on betting\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nLady Raikes, then, beamed in the pride of her beauty upon Epsom\r\nrace-course, dispensed smiles and luncheon to a host of acquaintances,\r\nand accepted, in return, all the homage and compliments which the young\r\nmen paid her. The hearty and jovial Sir Joseph Raikes was not the least\r\njealous of the admiration which his pretty wife caused; not even of Bob\r\nVincent, whom he rather pitied for his mishap, poor fellow! (to be sure,\r\nZuleika spoke of Vincent very scornfully, and treated his pretensions as\r\nabsurd); and with whom, meeting him on the course, Raikes shook hands\r\nvery cordially, and insisted upon bringing him up to Lady Raikes's\r\ncarriage, to take refreshment.\r\n\r\nThere _could_ have been no foundation for the wicked rumor, that Zuleika\r\nhad looked sweetly upon Vincent before Raikes had carried her off. Lady\r\nRaikes received Mr. Vincent with the kindest and frankest smile; shook\r\nhands with him with perfect politeness and indifference, and laughed and\r\ntalked so easily with him, that it was impossible there could have been\r\nany previous discomfort between them.\r\n\r\nNot very far off from Lady Raikes's carriage, on the hill, there stood a\r\nlittle black brougham--the quietest and most modest equipage in the\r\nworld, and in which there must have been nevertheless something very\r\nattractive, for the young men crowded around this carriage in numbers;\r\nand especially that young reprobate Dolly Trotter was to be seen,\r\nconstantly leaning his great elbows on the window, and poking his head\r\ninto the carriage. Lady Raikes remarked that, among other gentlemen, her\r\nhusband went up and spoke to the little carriage, and when he and Dolly\r\ncame back to her, asked who was in the black brougham.\r\n\r\nFor some time Raikes could not understand which was the brougham she\r\nmeant--there was so many broughams. \"The black one with the red blinds\r\nwas it? Oh, that--that was a very old friend--yes, old Lord Cripplegate,\r\nwas in the brougham: he had the gout, and he couldn't walk.\"\r\n\r\nAs Raikes made this statement he blushed as red as a geranium; he looked\r\nat Dolly Trotter in an imploring manner, who looked at him, and who\r\npresently went away from his sister's carriage bursting with laughter.\r\nAfter making the above statement to his wife, Raikes was particularly\r\npolite and attentive to her, and did not leave her side; nor would he\r\nconsent to her leaving the carriage. There were all sorts of vulgar\r\npeople about: she would be jostled in the crowd: she could not bear the\r\nsmell of the cigars--she knew she couldn't (this made Lady Raikes wince\r\na little): the sticks might knock her darling head off; and so forth.\r\n\r\nRaikes is a very accomplished and athletic man, and, as a bachelor,\r\njustly prided himself upon shying at the sticks better than any man in\r\nthe army. Perhaps, as he passed the persons engaged in that fascinating\r\nsport, he would have himself liked to join in it; but he declined his\r\nfavorite entertainment, and came back faithfully to the side of his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nAs Vincent talked at Lady Raikes's side, he alluded to this\r\naccomplishment of her husband. \"Your husband has not many\r\naccomplishments,\" Vincent said (he is a man of rather a sardonic humor),\r\n\"but in shying at the sticks he is quite unequalled: he has quite a\r\ngenius for it. He ought to have the sticks painted on his carriage, as\r\nthe French marshals have their batons. Hasn't he brought you a\r\npincushion or a jack-in-the-box, Lady Raikes? and has he begun to\r\nneglect you so soon? Every father with a little boy at home\" (and he\r\ncongratulated her ladyship on the birth of that son and heir) \"ought\r\nsurely to think of him, and bring him a soldier, or a monkey, or a toy\r\nor two.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" cried Lady Raikes, \"her husband must go. He must go and bring\r\nback a soldier, or a monkey, or a dear little jack-in-the-box, for dear\r\nlittle Dolly at home.\"\r\n\r\nSo away Raikes went; indeed nothing loth. He warmed with the noble\r\nsport: he was one of the finest players in England. He went on playing\r\nfor a delightful half-hour; (how swiftly, in the blessed amusement, it\r\npassed away!) he reduced several of the sticksters to bankruptcy by his\r\nbaculine skill; he returned to the carriage laden with jacks, wooden\r\napples and soldiers, enough to amuse all the nurseries in Pimlico.\r\n\r\nDuring his absence Lady Raikes, in the most winning manner, had asked\r\nMr. Vincent for his arm, for a little walk; and did not notice the sneer\r\nwith which he said that his arm had always been at her service. She was\r\nnot jostled by the crowd inconveniently; she was not offended by the\r\npeople smoking (though Raikes was forbidden that amusement); and she\r\nwalked up on Mr. Vincent's arm, and somehow found herself close to the\r\nlittle black brougham, in which sat gouty old Lord Cripplegate.\r\n\r\nGouty old Lord Cripplegate wore a light blue silk dress, a lace mantle\r\nand other gimcracks, a white bonnet with roses, and ringlets as long as\r\na chancellor's wig, but of the most beautiful black hue. His lordship\r\nhad a pair of enormous eyes, that languished in a most killing manner;\r\nand cheeks that were decorated with delicate dimples; and lips of the\r\ncolor of the richest sealing-wax.\r\n\r\n\"Who's that?\" asked Lady Raikes.\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said Mr. Vincent, \"is Mrs. Somerset Montmorency.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's Mrs. Somerset Montmorency?\" hissed out Zuleika.\r\n\r\n\"It is possible you have not met her in society, Mrs. Somerset\r\nMontmorency doesn't go much into society,\" Mr. Vincent said.\r\n\r\n\"Why did he say it was Lord Cripplegate?\"\r\n\r\nVincent, like a fiend, burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n\"Did Raikes say it was Lord Cripplegate? Well, he ought to know.\"\r\n\r\n\"What ought he to know?\" asked Zuleika.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, Lady Raikes,\" said the other, with his constant sneer;\r\n\"there are things which people had best not know. There are things which\r\npeople had best forget, as your ladyship very well knows. You forget;\r\nwhy shouldn't Raikes forget? Let by-gones be by-gones. Let's all forget,\r\nZulei--I beg your pardon. Here comes Raikes. How hot he looks! He has\r\ngot a hat full of jack-in-the-boxes. How obedient he has been! He will\r\nnot set the Thames on fire--but he's a good fellow. Yes; we'll forget\r\nall: won't we?\" And the fiend pulled the tuft under his chin, and gave a\r\ndiabolical grin with his sallow face.\r\n\r\nZuleika did not say one word about Lord Cripplegate when Raikes found\r\nher and flung his treasures into her lap. She did not show her anger in\r\nwords, but in an ominous, boding silence; during which her eyes might be\r\nseen moving constantly to the little black brougham.\r\n\r\nWhen the Derby was run, and Voltigeur was announced as the winner, Sir\r\nJoseph, who saw the race from the box of his carriage--having his arm\r\naround her ladyship, who stood on the back seat, and thought all men the\r\ngreatest hypocrites in creation (and so a man _is_ the greatest\r\nhypocrite of all animals, save one)--Raikes jumped up and gave a\r\n\"Hurrah!\" which he suddenly checked when his wife asked, with a\r\ndeathlike calmness, \"And pray, sir, have you been betting upon the race,\r\nthat you are so excited?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, my love; of course not. But you know it's a Yorkshire horse, and\r\nI--I'm glad it wins; that's all,\" Raikes said; in which statement there\r\nwas not, I am sorry to say, a word of truth.\r\n\r\nRaikes wasn't a betting man any more. He had forsworn it: he would never\r\nbet again. But he had just, in the course of the day, taken the odds in\r\n_one_ little bet; and he had just happened to win. When his wife charged\r\nhim with the crime, he was about to avow it. \"But no,\" he thought; \"it\r\nwill be a surprise for her. I will buy her the necklace she scolded me\r\nabout at Lacy and Gimcrack's; it's just the sum. She has been sulky all\r\nday. It's about that she is sulky now. I'll go and have another shy at\r\nthe sticks.\" And he went away, delighting himself with this notion, and\r\nwith the idea that at last he could satisfy his adorable little Zuleika.\r\n\r\nAs Raikes passed Mrs. Somerset Montmorency's brougham, Zuleika remarked\r\nhow that lady beckoned to him, and how Raikes went up to her. Though he\r\ndid not remain by the carriage two minutes, Zuleika was ready to take an\r\naffidavit that he was there for half an hour; and was saluted by a\r\nsatanical grin from Vincent, who by this time had returned to her\r\ncarriage side, and was humming a French tune, which says that \"_on\r\nrevient toujours a ses premi-e-res amours, a se-es premieres amours_.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that you are singing? How dare you sing that?\" cried Lady\r\nRaikes, with tears.\r\n\r\n\"It's an old song--you used to sing it,\" said Mr. Vincent. \"By the way,\r\nI congratulate you. Your husband has won six hundred pounds. I heard\r\nBetterton say so, who gave him the odds.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a wretch! He gave me his word of honor that he didn't bet. He is\r\na gambler--he'll ruin his child! He neglects his wife for that--that\r\ncreature! He calls her Lord Crick--crick--ipplegate,\" sobbed her\r\nladyship, \"Why did I marry him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, indeed!\" said Mr. Vincent.\r\n\r\nAs the two were talking, Dolly Trotter, her ladyship's brother, came up\r\nto the carriage; at which, with a scowl on his wicked countenance, and\r\nindulging inwardly in language which I am very glad not to be called\r\nupon to report, Vincent retired, biting his nails, like a traitor, and\r\nexhibiting every sign of ill-humor which the villain of a novel or of a\r\nplay is wont to betray.\r\n\r\n\"Don't have that fellow about you, Zuly,\" Dolly said to his darling\r\nsister. \"He is a bad one. He's no principle: he--he's a gambler, and\r\nevery thing that's bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know others who are gamblers,\" cried out Zuleika. \"I know others who\r\nare every thing that's bad, Adolphus,\" Lady Raikes exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"For heaven's sake, what do you mean?\" said Adolphus, becoming red and\r\nlooking very much frightened.\r\n\r\n\"I mean my husband,\" gasped the lady. \"I shall go home to papa. I shall\r\ntake my dear little blessed babe with me and go to papa, Adolphus. And\r\nif you had the spirit of a man, you would--you would avenge me, that you\r\nwould.\"\r\n\r\n\"Against Joe!\" said the heavy dragoon; \"against Joe, Zuly? Why, hang me\r\nif Joe isn't the greatest twump in Chwistendom. By Jove he is!\" said the\r\nbig one, shaking his fist; \"and if that scoundwel, Vincent, or any other\r\nwascal, has said a word against him, by Jove--\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray stop your horrid oaths and vulgar threats, Adolphus,\" her ladyship\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what it is--you've got something against Joe. Something\r\nhas put you against him; and if it's Vincent, I'll wring his--\"\r\n\r\n\"Mercy! mercy! Pray cease this language.\" Lady Raikes said.\r\n\r\n\"You don't know what a good fellow Joe is,\" said the dragoon. \"The best\r\ntwump in England, as _I've_ weason to say, sister: and here he comes\r\nwith the horses. God bless the old boy!\"\r\n\r\nWith this, honest Sir Joseph Raikes took his seat in his carriage; and\r\ntried, by artless blandishments, by humility, and by simple\r\nconversation, to coax his wife into good humor; but all his efforts were\r\nunavailing. She would not speak a word during the journey to London; and\r\nwhen she reached home, rushed up to the nursery and instantly burst into\r\ntears upon the sleeping little Adolphus's pink and lace cradle.\r\n\r\n\"It's all about that necklace, Mrs. Prince,\" the good-natured Baronet\r\nexplained to the nurse of the son and heir. \"I know it's about the\r\nnecklace. She rowed me about it all the way down to Epsom; and I can't\r\ngive it her now, that's flat. I've _no_ money. I _won't_ go tick, that's\r\nflat; and she ought to be contented with what she has had; oughtn't she,\r\nPrince?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed she ought, Sir Joseph; and you're an angel of a man, Sir Joseph;\r\nand so I often tell my lady, Sir Joseph,\" the nurse said: \"and the more\r\nyou will spile her, the more she will take on, Sir Joseph.\"\r\n\r\nBut if Lady Raikes was angry at not having the necklace, what must have\r\nbeen her ladyship's feelings when she saw in the box opposite to her at\r\nthe Opera, Mrs. Somerset Montmorency, with that very necklace on her\r\nshoulders for which she had pined in vain! How she got it? Who gave it\r\nher? How she came by the money to buy such a trinket? How she dared to\r\ndrive about at all in the Park, the audacious wretch! All these were\r\nquestions which the infuriate Zuleika put to herself, her confidential\r\nmaid, her child's nurse, and two or three of her particular friends; and\r\nof course she determined that there was but one clue to the mystery of\r\nthe necklace, which was that her husband had purchased it with the six\r\nhundred pounds which he had won at the Derby, which he denied having won\r\neven to her, which he had spent in this shameful manner. Nothing would\r\nsuit her but a return home to her papa--nothing would satisfy her but a\r\nseparation from the criminal who had betrayed her. She wept floods of\r\ntears over her neglected boy, and repeatedly asked that as yet\r\nspeechless innocent, whether he would remember his mother when her place\r\nwas filled by another, and whether her little Adolphus would take care\r\nthat no insult was offered to her untimely grave?\r\n\r\nThe row at home at length grew so unbearable, that Sir Joseph Raikes,\r\nwho had never had an explanation since his marriage, and had given into\r\nall his wife's caprices--that Sir Joseph, we say, even with his 'eavenly\r\ntemper, he broke out into a passion; and one day after dinner, at which\r\nonly his brother-in-law Dolly was present, told his wife that her\r\ntyranny was intolerable, and that it must come to an end.\r\n\r\nDolly said he was \"quite wight,\" and backed up Raikes in every way.\r\n\r\nZuleika said they were a pair of brutes, and that she desired to return\r\nto Sir Ajax.\r\n\r\n\"Why, what the devil is urging you?\" cried the husband; \"you drive me\r\nmad, Zuleika.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; what are you at, Zuleika? You dwive him cwazy,\" said the brother.\r\n\r\nUpon which Zuleika broke out. She briefly stated that her husband was a\r\nliar; that he was a gambler; that he had deceived her about betting at\r\nEpsom, and had given his word to a lie; that he had deceived her about\r\nthat--that woman,--and given his word to another lie; and that, with the\r\nfruits of his gambling transactions at Epsom, he had purchased the\r\ndiamond necklace, not for her, but for that--that person! That was\r\nall--that was enough. Let her go home and die in Baker Street, in the\r\nroom which, she prayed Heaven, she never had quitted! That was her\r\ncharge. If Sir Joseph Raikes had any thing to say he had better say it.\r\n\r\nSir Joseph Raikes said, that she had the most confounded jealous temper\r\nthat ever a woman was cursed with; that he had been on his knees to her\r\never since his marriage, and had spent half his income in administering\r\nto her caprices and extravagancies; that as for these charges, they were\r\nso monstrous, he should not condescend to answer them; and as she chose\r\nto leave her husband and her child, she might go whenever she liked.\r\n\r\nLady Raikes upon this rang the bell, and requested Hickson the butler to\r\ntell Dickson her maid to bring down her bonnet and shawl; and when\r\nHickson quitted the dining-room, Dolly Trotter began:\r\n\r\n\"Zuleika,\" said he, \"you are enough to twy the patience of an angel;\r\nand, by Jove, you do! You've got the best fellow for a husband (a sneer\r\nfrom Zuleika) that ever was bullied by a woman, and you tweat him like a\r\ndawg. When you were ill, you used to make him get up of a night to go to\r\nthe doctor's. When you're well, you plague his life out of him. He pays\r\nyour milliner's bills, as if you were a duchess, and you have but to ask\r\nfor a thing and you get it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, I have necklaces!\" said Zuleika.\r\n\r\n\"Confound you, Zuly! had'nt he paid three hundwed and eighty for a new\r\ncawwiage for you the week before? Hadn't he fitted your dwawing-woom\r\nwith yellow satin at the beginning of the season? Hadn't he bought you\r\nthe pair of ponies you wanted, and gone without a hack himself, and he\r\ngettin' as fat as a porpoise for want of exercise, the poor old boy? And\r\nfor that necklace, do you know how it was that you didn't have it, and\r\nthat you were very nearly having it, you ungwateful little devil you? It\r\nwas _I_ prevented you! He _did_ win six hundwed at the Derby; and he\r\nwould have bought your necklace, but he gave me the money. The governor\r\nsaid he never would pay another play-debt again for me; and bet I would,\r\nlike a confounded, gweat, stooped fool: and it was this old Joe--this\r\ndear old twump--who booked up for me, and took me out of the hole, like\r\nthe best fellow in the whole world, by Jove! And--and I'll never bet\r\nagain, so help me----! And that's why he couldn't tell--and that's why\r\nhe wouldn't split on me--and that's why you didn't have your confounded\r\nnecklace, which old Cwipplegate bought for Mrs. Montmowency, who's going\r\nto marry her, like a confounded fool for his pains!\"\r\n\r\nAnd here the dragoon being blown, took a large glass of claret; and when\r\nHickson and Dickson came down stairs, they found her ladyship in rather\r\na theatrical attitude, on her knees, embracing her husband's big hand,\r\nand calling down blessings upon him, and owning that she was a wretch, a\r\nmonster, and a fiend.\r\n\r\nShe was only a jealous, little spoiled fool of a woman; and I am sure\r\nthose who read her history have never met with her like, or have ever\r\nplagued their husbands. Certainly they have not, if they are not\r\nmarried: as, let us hope, they will be.\r\n\r\nAs for Vincent, he persists in saying that the defence is a fib from\r\nbeginning to end, and that the Trotters were agreed to deceive Lady\r\nRaikes. But who hasn't had his best actions misinterpreted by calumny?\r\nAnd what innocence or good will can disarm jealousy?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVery different from THACKARAY is the genial Mrs. S. C. HALL, from whom\r\nwe have\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD LAYTON'S REWARD.\r\n\r\n\"I could not have believed it!\" exclaimed Mrs. Pierce Bradshaw. \"I could\r\nnot have believed it!\" she repeated, over and over again; and she fell\r\ninto a fit of abstraction.\r\n\r\nHer husband, who had been glancing wearily over a magazine, turning leaf\r\nafter leaf without reading, or perhaps seeing even the heading of a\r\npage, at length said, \"I could!\"\r\n\r\n\"You have large faith, my dear,\" observed the lady.\r\n\r\n\"Fortunately for Selina, I had no faith in him,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pierce Bradshaw was not an eloquent person; she never troubled her\r\nhusband or any one else with many words; so she only murmured, in a\r\nsubdued tone, \"Fortunately, indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"What a fellow he was!\" said Mr. P. Bradshaw, as he closed the magazine.\r\n\"Do you remember how delighted you were with him the evening of the\r\n_tableaux_ at Lady Westrophe's? There was something so elegant and\r\ndignified in his bearing; so much ease and grace of manner; his address\r\nwas perfect--the confidence of a well-bred gentleman, subdued almost,\r\nbut not quite, into softness by the timidity of youth. This was thrown\r\ninto strong relief by the manners of the young men of the family, whose\r\nhabits and voices might have entitled them to take the lead, even now,\r\nin the go-a-head school, which then was hardly in existence--at all\r\nevents in England.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were quite as much taken with him as I was.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my dear, not _quite_. Edward Layton was especially suited for the\r\nsociety of ladies. His tastes and feelings are--or _were_ at that\r\ntime--all sincerely refined; he was full of the impulse of talent, which\r\nhe never had strength to bring forth: his thoughts were ever wandering,\r\nand he needed perpetual excitement, particularly the excitement of\r\nbeauty and music, to bring them and keep them where he _was_. He was\r\nstrongly and strangely moved by excellence of any kind, so that it _was_\r\nexcellence; and the only thing I ever heard him express contempt for was\r\nwealth!--yes wealth!\"\r\n\r\n\"I could not have believed it,\" said Mrs. Pierce Bradshaw again.\r\n\r\n\"That particular night it was whispered he was engaged to Lelia Medwin.\r\nWhen she sung, he stood like a young Apollo at her harp, too entranced\r\nto turn over the leaves of music, his eyes overflowing with delight, and\r\nthe poor little girl so bewitched by his attentions that she fancied\r\nevery whisper a declaration of love.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shameful!\" said Mrs. Pierce Bradshaw.\r\n\r\n\"Then her mother showed every one what a lovely sketch he had made of\r\nLelia's head, adding, that indeed it was too lovely; but then, he was a\r\n_partial_ judge.\"\r\n\r\n\"She was a silly woman,\" observed the lady.\r\n\r\n\"She would not have been considered so if they had been married,\"\r\nreplied the gentleman. \"Mammas have no mercy on each other in those\r\ndelicate manoeuvrings. Well, he waltzed with her always; and bent over\r\nher--willow-fashion; looked with her at the moon; and wrote a sonnet\r\nwhich she took to herself, for it was addressed 'To mine own dear ----;'\r\nand then when, about eight weeks afterwards, we met him at the\r\n_dejeuner_ at Sally Lodge, he was as entranced with Lizzie Grey's guitar\r\nas he had been with Lelia's harp, sketched her little tiger head for her\r\ngrandmamma, waltzed with _her_, bent over _her_ willow-fashion, looked\r\nwith her at the moon, and wrote another sonnet, addressed 'To the loved\r\none.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Such men----\" exclaimed Mrs. Pierce Bradshaw. She did not finish the\r\nsentence, but looked as if such men ought to be exterminated. And so\r\nthey ought!\r\n\r\n\"There was so much about him that I liked: his fine talents, good\r\nmanners, excellent position in society, added to his good nature,\r\nand----\"\r\n\r\n\"Good fortune,\" added Mrs. Pierce Bradshaw.\r\n\r\n\"No, Mary,\" said her husband, quietly, \"I never was a _mammon\r\nworshipper_. This occurred, if you remember, before the yellow\r\npestilence had so completely subverted London, that the very aristocracy\r\nknelt and worshipped the golden calf; and no blame to the calf to\r\n_receive_ the homage, whatever we may say of those who paid it.\r\n\r\n\"I did not mean _that_ as a reproof, Pierce,\" replied his wife, most\r\ntruly. \"_I_ think it quite natural to like young men of fortune--we\r\ncould not get on without them, you know; and it would be very\r\nimprudent--very imprudent, indeed--to invite any young man, however\r\nexcellent. When we want to get these young girls, our poor nieces, off,\r\nI declare it is quite melancholy. Jane is becoming _serious_ since she\r\nhas grown so thin; and I fear the men will think Belle a blue, she has\r\nso taken to the British Museum. Oh, how I wish people would live, and\r\nbring up, and get off their own daughters! Four marriageable nieces,\r\nwith such farthing fortunes, are enough to drive any poor aunt\r\ndistracted!\"\r\n\r\nThis was the longest speech Mrs. Bradshaw ever made in her life, and she\r\nsighed deeply at its conclusion.\r\n\r\n\"You may well sigh!\" laughed the gentleman; \"for the case seems\r\nhopeless. But I was going to say, that as I knew him better, I was\r\nreally going to take the young gentleman a little to task on the score\r\nof his philandering. Lelia was really attached to him, and had refused a\r\nvery advantageous offer for his sake; but the very next week, at another\r\nhouse, I found him enchained by a sparkling widow--correcting her\r\ndrawings, paying the homage of intelligent silence and sweet smiles to\r\nher wit, leaning his white-gloved hand upon her chair, and looking in\r\nher eyes with his most bewitching softness. The extent of this\r\nflirtation no one could anticipate; but the sudden appearance of Lady\r\nDi' Johnson effected a total change. She drove four-in-hand, and was a\r\ndead shot--the very antipodes of sentiment. We said her laugh would\r\ndrive Edward Layton distracted, and her _cigarette_ be his death. But,\r\nno! the magnificence of her tomboyism caught his fancy. He enshrined her\r\nat once as Diana, bayed the moon with hunting-songs, wrote a sonnet to\r\nthe chase, and then, with his own hands, twisted it into a _cigarette_,\r\nwith which her ladyship puffed it to the winds of heaven, while\r\nwandering with the Lothario amid a grove of fragrant limes. The miracle\r\nwas, that at breakfast the next morning Lady Di' was subdued, voted\r\ndriving unfeminine, and asked Edward to take the reins for her after\r\nlunch. You remember we left them there; and I next met him at Killarney,\r\ngiving his chestnut locks to the breeze, his arm to the oar, and his\r\neyes to a lady of blue-stocking celebrity, who, never having had many\r\nlovers, was inclined to make the most of the present one. Circumstances\r\nrendered me acquainted with some facts relating to his 'flirtations,' if\r\nhis soft and sentimental ways could be called by such a name. I had seen\r\npoor Lelia at Baden-Baden; and I dare say you can recall what we heard\r\nof another love of his nearer home. Well, I encountered my Hero of\r\nLadies that very evening, wandering amid the ruined aisles of Mucross\r\nAbbey. I saw that his impressible nature had taken a thoughtful, if not\r\na religious tone, from the scene. And he commenced the conversation by\r\ndeclaring, that 'He was a great fool.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Knave, rather,\" said Mrs. Pierce Bradshaw.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied her husband; \"not a knave, but a singular example of a man\r\nwhose feelings and susceptibilities never deepen into\r\naffection--unstable as water--tossed hither and thither for want of\r\nfixed principles, and suffering intensely in his better moods from the\r\nknowledge of the weakness he has not the courage to overcome. I was not\r\ninclined to let him spare himself, and did not contradict his opinion\r\nthat he was a 'fool,' but told him he might be what he pleased himself,\r\nas long as he did not make fools of others.\"\r\n\r\n\"'I tell every woman I know that I am not a marrying man,' he replied.\r\n\r\n\"'That,' I said, 'does not signify as long as you act the lover, each\r\nfair one believing you will revoke in her favor.'\r\n\r\n\"'I give you my honor,' he exclaimed, 'as a man and a gentleman, I never\r\nentertained for twenty-four hours the idea of marrying any woman I ever\r\nknew.'\"\r\n\r\n\"The villain!\" exclaimed the lady. \"I hope, Pierce, you told him he was\r\na villain!\"\r\n\r\n\"No; because I knew the uncertainty of his disposition: but I lectured\r\nhim fully and honestly, and yet said nothing to him so severe as what he\r\nsaid of himself. I told him he would certainly be caught in the end by\r\nsome unworthy person, and then he would look back with regret and misery\r\nupon the chances he had lost, and the unhappiness he had caused to those\r\nwhose only faults had been in believing him true when he was false.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Better that,' he answered, 'than marrying when he could not make up\r\nhis mind.'\r\n\r\n\"'Then why play the lover?'\r\n\r\n\"'He only did so while infatuated--he was certain to find faults where\r\nhe imagined perfection.'\"\r\n\r\n\"What assurance!\" said Mrs. Pierce Bradshaw.\r\n\r\n\"'I am sure,' I said, 'Lelia was very charming. Lelia Medwin was an\r\nexcellent, amiable little creature, with both good temper and good\r\nsense.'\r\n\r\n\"'That was it,' he said: 'only fancy the six-foot-one-and-three-quarters\r\nwedded to bare five feet! The absurdity struck me one night as we were\r\nwaltzing and whirling past a looking-glass; I was obliged to bend\r\ndouble, though I never felt it till I saw it.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, I have not patience,\" observed Mrs. Bradshaw. \"And so her\r\nfeelings were to be trampled upon because she was not tall enough to\r\nplease _him_! Why did he not think of that before?\"\r\n\r\n\"'But there was Lizzy Grey, related to half the aristocracy, with a\r\nvoice like an angel.'\r\n\r\n\"'A vixen,' he said, 'though of exquisite beauty--could have torn my\r\neyes out for the little attention I paid Mrs. Green.'\r\n\r\n\"'_Little attention!_' I repeated; 'more than little.'\r\n\r\n\"'Her wit was delicious,' he replied; 'but she was a widow! Only fancy\r\nthe horror of being compared with 'My dear first husband!'\r\n\r\n\"'Then your conquest of Lady Di' Johnson! How badly you behaved to her!'\r\n\r\n\"'She was magnificent on horseback; and her _cigarette_ as fascinating\r\nas the fan of a Madrid belle, or the _tournure_ of a Parisian lady. They\r\nwere her _two points_. But when she relinquished both, I believe in\r\ncompliment to _me_, she became even more commonplace than the most\r\ncommonplace woman.'\"\r\n\r\n\"The puppy!\" muttered the lady: \"the dreadful puppy! I could not have\r\nbelieved it!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bradshaw did not heed the interruption, but continued:\r\n\r\n\"'And who,' I inquired, 'was the Lady of the Lake? I do not mean of\r\n_this lake_, for I see her reign is already over--your passion expired\r\nwith the third chapter of her novel, which I know she read to you by\r\nmoonlight--but the fair Lady of Geneva, whose betrothed called you out?'\r\n\r\n\"'Her father was a sugar-boiler,' was the quiet reply: 'a sugar-boiler,\r\nor something of the kind. What would my aristocratic mother say to that?\r\nOf course I could have had no serious intention _there_. Indeed I never\r\n_had_ a serious intention for a whole week.'\r\n\r\n\"'But, my dear fellow, when presents are given, and letters written, and\r\nlocks of hair and vows exchanged----'\r\n\r\n\"'No, no!' he exclaimed; '_no_ vows exchanged! I never broke my word to\r\na woman yet. It was admiration for this or that--respect, esteem,\r\nperhaps a tender bewilderment--mere _brotherly_ love. And in that\r\nparticular instance her intended got angry at my civility. I know I was\r\nwrong; and, to confess the truth, I am ashamed of that transaction--it\r\ntaught me a lesson; and, but for the confounded vacillation of my taste\r\nand temper, I might perhaps have been a Benedick before this. You may\r\nthink it puppyism, if you please; but I am really sorry when I make an\r\nimpression, and resolve never to attempt it again: but the next fine\r\nvoice, or fine eyes----'\r\n\r\n\"'Or cigarette,' I suggested; and then I said as much as one man can say\r\nto another, for you know a woman can say much more to a man in the way\r\nof reproof than he would bear from his own sex; but he silenced me very\r\nquickly by regrets and good resolutions. It was after that our little\r\nniece, Selina, made an impression upon him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not know all you have now told me,\" expostulated his wife. \"I own\r\nI thought it would have been a good match for Selina; and he was\r\nevidently deeply smitten before he knew she was your niece. I managed it\r\nbeautifully; but you cut the matter short by offending him.\"\r\n\r\n\"There, say no more about it,\" said the sensible husband; \"you thought\r\nyour blue-eyed, fair-haired, doll-like favorite, could have enchained a\r\nman who had escaped heart-whole from the toils of the richest and rarest\r\nin the land. It really is fearful to see how women not only tolerate,\r\nbut pursue this sort of men. You call them 'villains,' and I know not\r\nwhat, when you are foiled; but if you succeed, you temper it; they have\r\nbeen a little wild, to be sure--but then, and then, and then--you really\r\ncould not refuse your daughter; and add, \"Men _are_ such creatures that\r\nif the world knew but all, _he_ is not worse than others.\"\r\n\r\n\"For shame, Pierce! how can you?\" said the lady.\r\n\r\n\"I told him then,\" continued Mr. Bradshaw, \"that he would take '_the\r\ncrooked stick at last_;' but that he should not add a tress of Selina's\r\nhair to his collection, to be turned over by _his_ WIFE one of those\r\ndays. Of course he was very indignant, and we parted; but I did not\r\nthink my prophecy would come true so soon. I have long since given up\r\nspeculating how marriages will turn out, for it is quite impossible to\r\ntell. If women could be shut up in a harem, as in the East, a man who\r\nwas ashamed of his wife might go into society without her; but for a\r\nrefined and well-educated gentleman, as Edward Layton certainly is, to\r\nbe united to the _widow_ of a sugar-boiler!--yes, absolutely!--who is an\r\ninch shorter than pretty Lelia and more tiger-headed than Lizzy Grey,\r\nand who declares she hates music, although her dear first husband took\r\nher _h_often to the Hopera--who adds deformity to shortness, talks\r\nloudly of the _h_influence of wealth, and compares the presentations at\r\nthe Mansion House, that she has seen, to those at St. James's which she\r\nhas not yet seen! Verily, Edward Layton has had _his reward_!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBULWER LYTTON contributes to the \"Keepsake\" an essay, characteristic of\r\nhis earlier rather than of his later style:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONFIRMED VALETUDINARIAN.\r\n\r\nCertainly there is truth in the French saying, that there is no ill\r\nwithout something of good. What state more pitiable to the eye of a man\r\nof robust health than that of the Confirmed Valetudinarian? Indeed,\r\nthere is no one who has a more profound pity for himself than your\r\nValetudinarian; and yet he enjoys two of the most essential requisites\r\nfor a happy life; he is never without an object of interest, and he is\r\nperpetually in pursuit of hope.\r\n\r\nOur friend Sir George Malsain is a notable case in point: young, well\r\nborn, rich, not ill educated, and with some ability, they who knew him\r\nformerly, in what were called his \"gay days,\" were accustomed to call\r\nhim \"lucky dog,\" and \"enviable fellow.\" How shallow is the judgment of\r\nmortals! Never was a poor man so bored--nothing interested him. His\r\nconstitution seemed so formed for longevity, and his condition so free\r\nfrom care, that he was likely to have a long time before him:--it is\r\nimpossible to say how long that time seemed to him. Fortunately, from\r\nsome accidental cause or other, he woke one morning and found himself\r\nill; and, whether it was the fault of the doctor or himself I cannot\r\npretend to say, but he never got well again. His ailments became\r\nchronic; he fell into a poor way. From that time life has assumed to him\r\na new aspect. Always occupied with himself, he is never bored. He may be\r\nsick, sad, suffering, but he has found his object in existence--he lives\r\nto be cured. His mind is fully occupied; his fancy eternally on the\r\nwing. Formerly he had travelled much, but without any pleasure in\r\nmovement: he might as well have stayed at home. Now, when he travels, it\r\nis for an end; it is delightful to witness the cheerful alertness with\r\nwhich he sets about it. He is going down the Rhine;--for its scenery?\r\nPshaw! he never cared a button about scenery; but he has great hopes of\r\nthe waters at Kreuznach. He is going into Egypt;--to see the Pyramids?\r\nStuff! the climate on the Nile is so good for the mucous membrane! Set\r\nhim down at the dullest of dull places, and he himself is never dull.\r\nThe duller the place the better; his physician has the more time to\r\nattend to him. When you meet him he smiles on you, and says, poor\r\nfellow, \"The doctor assures me that in two years I shall be quite set\r\nup.\" He has said the same thing the last twenty years, and will say it\r\nthe day before his death!...\r\n\r\nWhat a busy, anxious, fidgety creature Ned Worrell was? That iron frame\r\nsupported all the business of all society! Every man who wanted any\r\nthing done, asked Ned Worrell to do it. And do it Ned Worrell did! You\r\nremember how feelingly he was wont to sigh,--\"Upon my life I'm a perfect\r\nslave.\" But now Ned Worrell has snapped his chain; obstinate dyspepsia,\r\nand a prolonged nervous debility, have delivered him from the carks and\r\ncares of less privileged mortals. Not Ariel under the bough is more\r\nexempt from humanity than Edward Worrell. He is enjoined to be kept in a\r\nstate of perfect repose, free from agitation, and hermetically shut out\r\nfrom grief. His wife pays his bills, and he is only permitted to see his\r\nbanker's accounts when the balance in his favor is more than usually\r\ncheerful. His eldest daughter, an intelligent young lady, reads his\r\nletters, and only presents to him those which are calculated to make a\r\npleasing impression. Call now on your old friend, on a question of life\r\nand death, to ask his advice, or request his interference--you may as\r\nwell call on King Cheops under the Great Pyramid. The whole houseguard\r\nof tender females block the way.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Worrell is not to be disturbed on any matter of business whatever,\"\r\nthey will tell you. \"But, my dear ma'am, he is trusted to my marriage\r\nsettlement; his signature is necessary to a transfer of my wife's\r\nfortune from those cursed railway shares. To-morrow they will be down at\r\nzero. We shall be ruined!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Worrell is in a sad, nervous way, and can't be disturbed, sir.\" And\r\nthe door is shut in your face!\r\n\r\nIt was after some such occurrence that I took into earnest consideration\r\na certain sentiment of Plato's, which I own I had till then considered\r\nvery inhuman; for that philosopher is far from being the tender and\r\nsensitive gentleman generally believed in by lovers and young ladies.\r\nPlato, in his \"Republic,\" blames Herodicus (one of the teachers of that\r\ngreat doctor Hippocrates) for showing to delicate, sickly persons, the\r\nmeans whereby to prolong their valetudinary existence, as Herodicus\r\nhimself (naturally a very rickety fellow) had contrived to do. Plato\r\naccuses this physician of having thereby inflicted a malignant and\r\nwanton injury on those poor persons;--nay, not only an injury on them,\r\nbut on all society. \"For,\" argues this stern, broad-shouldered Athenian,\r\n\"how can people be virtuous who are always thinking of their own\r\ninfirmities?\" And therefore he opines, that if a sickly person cannot\r\nwholly recover health and become robust, the sooner he dies the better\r\nfor himself and others! The wretch, too, might be base enough to marry,\r\nand have children as ailing as their father, and so injure, _in\r\nperpetuo_, the whole human race. Away with him!\r\n\r\nBut, upon cool and dispassionate reflection, it seemed to me, angry as I\r\nwas with Ned Worrell, that Plato stretched the point a little too far;\r\nand certainly, in the present state of civilization, so sweeping a\r\ncondemnation of the sickly would go far towards depopulating Europe.\r\nCelsus, for instance, classes amongst the delicate or sickly the greater\r\npart of the inhabitants of towns, and nearly all literary folks\r\n(_omnesque pene cupidi literarum_). And if we thus made away with the\r\ndenizens of the towns, it would be attended with a great many\r\ninconveniencies as to shopping, &c., be decidedly injurious to house\r\nproperty, and might greatly affect the state of the funds; while,\r\nwithout literary folks, we should be very dull in our healthy\r\ncountry-seats, deprived of newspapers, novels, and \"The Keepsake.\"\r\nWherefore, on the whole, I think Herodicus was right; and that sickly\r\npersons should not only be permitted but encouraged to live as long as\r\nthey can.\r\n\r\nThat proposition granted, if in this attempt to show that your confirmed\r\nValetudinarian is not so utterly miserable as he is held to be by those\r\nwho throw physic to the dogs--and that in some points he may be a\r\ndecided gainer by his physical sufferings--I have not wholly\r\nfailed--then I say, with the ingenious Author who devoted twenty years\r\nto a work \"On the Note of the Nightingale,\"--\"I have not lived in\r\nvain!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA STORY WITHOUT A NAME.[24]\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE,\r\n\r\nBY G. P. R. JAMES, ESQ.\r\n\r\n_Continued from Page 44._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nReader, can you go back for twenty years? You do it every day. You say,\r\n\"Twenty years ago I was a boy--twenty years ago I was a youth--twenty\r\nyears ago I played at peg-top and at marbles--twenty years ago I\r\nwooed--was loved--I sinned--I suffered!\" What is there in twenty years\r\nthat should keep us from going back over them? You go on so fast, so\r\nsmoothly, so easily on the forward course--why not in retrogression? But\r\nlet me tell you: it makes a very great difference whether Hope or Memory\r\ndrives the coach.\r\n\r\nBut let us see what we can do. Twenty years before the period at which\r\nthe last chapter broke off, Philip Hastings, now a father of a girl of\r\nfifteen, was a lad standing by the side of his brother's grave. Twenty\r\nyears ago Sir John Hastings was the living lord of these fine lands and\r\nbroad estates. Twenty years ago he passed, from the mouth of the vault\r\nin which he had laid the clay of the first-born, into the open splendor\r\nof the day, and felt sorrow's desolation in the sunshine. Twenty years\r\nago, he had been confronted on the church-yard path by a tall old woman,\r\nand challenged with words high and stern, to do her right in regard to a\r\npaltry rood or two of land. Twenty years ago he had given her a harsh,\r\ncold answer, and treated her menaces with impatient scorn.\r\n\r\nDo you remember her, reader? Well, if you do, that brings us to the\r\npoint I sought to reach in the dull flat expanse of the far past; and we\r\ncan stand and look around us for awhile.\r\n\r\nThat old woman was not one easily to forget or lightly to yield her\r\nresentments. There was something perdurable in them as well as in her\r\ngaunt, sinewy frame. As she stood there menacing him, she wanted but\r\nthree years of seventy. She had battled too with many a storm--wind and\r\nweather, suffering and persecution, sorrow and privation, had beat upon\r\nher hard--very hard. They had but served to stiffen and wither and\r\nharden, however. Her corporeal frame, shattered as it seemed, was\r\ndestined to outlive many of the young and fair spirit-tabernacles around\r\nit--to pass over, by long years, the ordinary allotted space of human\r\nlife; and it seemed as if even misfortune had with her but a preserving\r\npower. It is not wonderful, however, that, while it worked thus upon her\r\nbody, it should likewise have stiffened and withered and hardened her\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nI am not sure that conscience itself went untouched in this searing\r\nprocess. It is not clear at all that even her claim upon Sir John\r\nHastings was not an unjust one; but just or unjust his repulse sunk deep\r\nand festered.\r\n\r\nLet us trace her from the church-yard after she met him. She took her\r\npath away from the park and the hamlet, between two cottages, the ragged\r\nboys at the doors of which called her \"Old Witch,\" and spoke about a\r\nbroom-stick.\r\n\r\nShe heeded them little: there were deeper offences rankling at her\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nShe walked on, across a corn-field and a meadow, and then she came upon\r\nsome woodlands, through which a little sandy path wound its way, round\r\nstumps of old trees long cut down, amidst young bushes and saplings just\r\nspringing up, and catching the sunshine here and there through the\r\nbright-tinted foliage overhead. Up the hill it went, over the slope on\r\nwhich the copse was scattered, and then burst forth again on the\r\nopposite side of wood and rise, where the ground fell gently the other\r\nway, looking down upon the richly dressed grounds of Colonel Marshall,\r\nat the distance of some three miles.\r\n\r\nNot more than a hundred yards distant was poor man's cottage, with an\r\nold gray thatch which wanted some repairing, and was plentifully covered\r\nwith herbs, sending the threads of their roots into the straw. A little\r\nbadly cultivated garden, fenced off from the hill-side by a loose stone\r\nwall, surrounded the house, and a gate without hinges gave entrance to\r\nthis inclosed space.\r\n\r\nThe old woman went in and approached the cottage door. When near it she\r\nstopped and listened, lifting one of the flapping ears of her cotton cap\r\nto aid the dull sense of hearing. There were no voices within; but there\r\nwas a low sobbing sound issued forth as if some one were in bitter\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\n\"I should not wonder if she were alone,\" said the old woman; \"the\r\nruffian father is always out; the drudging mother goes about this time\r\nto the town. They will neither stay at home, I wot, to grieve for him\r\nthey let too often into that door, nor to comfort her he has left\r\ndesolate. But it matters little whether they be in or out. It were\r\nbetter to talk to her first. I will give her better than\r\ncomfort--revenge, if I judge right. They must play their part\r\nafterwards.\"\r\n\r\nThus communing with herself, she laid her hand upon the latch and opened\r\nthe door. In an attitude of unspeakable grief sat immediately before her\r\na young and exceedingly beautiful girl, of hardly seventeen years of\r\nage. The wheel stood still by her side; the spindle had fallen from her\r\nhands; her head was bowed down as with sorrow she could not bear up\r\nagainst; and her eyes were dropping tears like rain.\r\n\r\nThe moment she heard the door open she started, and looked up with fear\r\nupon her face, and strove to dash the tears from her eyes; but the old\r\nwoman bespoke her softly, saying, \"Good even, my dear; is your mother in\r\nthe place?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied the girl; \"she has gone to sell the lint, and father is\r\nout too. It is very lonely, and I get sad here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not wonder at it, poor child,\" said the old woman; \"you have had a\r\nheavy loss, my dear, and may well cry. You can't help what is past, you\r\nknow; but we can do a good deal for what is to come, if we but take care\r\nand make up our minds in time.\"\r\n\r\nMany and strange were the changes of expression which came upon the poor\r\ngirl's face as she heard these few simple words. At first her cheek\r\nglowed hot, as with the burning blush of shame; then she turned pale and\r\ntrembled, gazing inquiringly in her visitor's face, as if she would have\r\nasked, \"Am I detected?\" and then she cast down her eyes again, still\r\npale as ashes, and the tears rolled forth once more and fell upon her\r\nlap.\r\n\r\nThe old woman sat down beside her, and talked to her tenderly; but,\r\nalas! very cunningly too. She assumed far greater knowledge than she\r\npossessed. She persuaded the poor girl that there was nothing to conceal\r\nfrom her; and what neither father nor mother knew, was told that day to\r\none comparatively a stranger. Still the old woman spoke tenderly--ay,\r\nvery tenderly; excused her fault--made light of her fears--gave her\r\nhope--gave her strength. But all the time she concealed her full\r\npurpose. That was to be revealed by degrees. Whatever had been the\r\ngirl's errors, she was too innocent to be made a party to a scheme of\r\nfraud and wrong and vengeance at once. All that the woman communicated\r\nwas blessed comfort to a bruised and bleeding heart; and the poor girl\r\nleaned her head upon her old companion's shoulder, and, amidst bitter\r\ntears and sobs and sighs, poured out every secret of her heart.\r\n\r\nBut what is that she says, which makes the old woman start with a look\r\nof triumph?\r\n\r\n\"Letters!\" she exclaimed; \"two letters: let me see them, child--let me\r\nsee them! Perhaps they may be more valuable than you think.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl took them from her bosom, where she kept them as all that she\r\npossessed of one gone that day into the tomb.\r\n\r\nThe old woman read them with slow eyes, but eager attention; and then\r\ngave them back, saying, \"That one you had better destroy as soon as\r\npossible--it tells too much. But this first one keep, as you value your\r\nown welfare--as you value your child's fortune, station, and happiness.\r\nYou can do much with this. Why, here are words that may make your father\r\na proud man. Hark! I hear footsteps coming. Put them up--we must go to\r\nwork cautiously, and break the matter to your parents by degrees.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the mother of the girl who entered; and she seemed faint and\r\ntired. Well had the old woman called her a drudge, for such she was--a\r\npoor patient household drudge, laboring for a hard, heartless, idle, and\r\ncunning husband, and but too tenderly fond of the poor girl whose beauty\r\nhad been a snare to her.\r\n\r\nShe seemed somewhat surprised to see the old woman there; for they were\r\nof different creeds, and those creeds made wide separation in the days I\r\nspeak of. Perhaps she was surprised and grieved to see the traces of\r\ntears and agitation on her daughter's face; but of that she took no\r\nnotice; for there were doubts and fears at her heart which she dreaded\r\nto confirm. The girl was more cheerful, however, than she had been for\r\nthe last week--not gay, not even calm; but yet there was a look of some\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nOften even after her mother's entrance, the tears would gather thick in\r\nher eyes when she thought of the dead; but it was evident that hope had\r\nrisen up: that the future was not all darkness and terror. This was a\r\ncomfort to her; and she spoke and looked cheerfully. She had sold all\r\nthe thread of her and her daughter's spinning, and she had sold it well.\r\nPart she hid in a corner to keep a pittance for bread from her husband's\r\neyes; part she reserved to give up to him for the purchase of drink: but\r\nwhile she made all these little arrangements, she looked somewhat\r\nanxiously at the old woman, from time to time, as if she fain would have\r\nasked, \"What brought you here?\"\r\n\r\nThe crone was cautious, however, and knew well with whom she had to\r\ndeal. She talked in solemn and oracular tones, as if she had possessed\r\nall the secrets of fate, but she told nothing, and when she went away\r\nshe said in a low voice but authoritative manner, \"Be kind to your\r\ngirl--be very kind; for she will bring good luck and fortune to you\r\nall.\" The next day she laid wait for the husband, found and forced him\r\nto stop and hear her. At first he was impatient, rude, and brutal;\r\nswore, cursed, and called her many and evil names. But soon he listened\r\neagerly enough: looks of intelligence and eager design passed between\r\nthe two, and ere they parted they perfectly understood each other.\r\n\r\nThe man was then, on more than one day, seen going down to the hall. At\r\nfirst he was refused admission to Sir John Hastings; for his character\r\nwas known. The next day, however, he brought a letter written under his\r\ndictation by his daughter, who had been taught at a charitable school of\r\nold foundation hard by; and this time he was admitted. His conversation\r\nwith the Lord of the Manor was long; but no one knew its import. He came\r\nagain and again, and was still admitted.\r\n\r\nA change came over the cottage and its denizens. The fences were put in\r\norder, the walls were repaired, the thatch renewed, another room or two\r\nwas added; plenty reigned within; mother and daughter appeared in\r\nsomewhat finer apparel; and money was not wanting.\r\n\r\nAt the end of some months there was the cry of a young child in the\r\nhouse. The neighbors were scandalized, and gossips spoke censoriously\r\neven in the father's ears; but he stopped them fiercely, with proud and\r\nmysterious words; boasted aloud of what they had thought his daughter's\r\nshame; and claimed a higher place for her than was willingly yielded to\r\nher companions. Strange rumors got afloat, but ere a twelvemonth had\r\npassed, the father had drank himself to death. His widow and her\r\ndaughter and her grandson moved to a better house, and lived at ease on\r\nmoney none knew the source of, while the cottage, now neat and in good\r\nrepair, became the dwelling of the old woman, who had been driven with\r\nscorn from Sir John's presence. Was she satisfied--had she sated\r\nherself? Not yet.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nThere was a lady, a very beautiful lady indeed, came to a lonely house,\r\nwhich seemed to have been tenanted for several years by none but\r\nservants, about three years after the death of Sir John Hastings. That\r\nhouse stood some miles to the north of the seat of that gentleman, which\r\nnow had passed to his son; and it was a fine-looking place, with a\r\nmassive sort of solemn brick-and-mortar grandeur about it, which\r\nimpressed the mind with a sense of the wealth and long-standing of its\r\nowners.\r\n\r\nThe plural has slipped from my pen, and perhaps it is right; for the\r\nhouse looked as if it had had many owners, and all of them had been\r\nrich.\r\n\r\nNow, there was but one owner,--the lady who descended from that\r\nlumbering, heavy coach, with the two great leathern wings on each side\r\nof the door. She was dressed in widow's weeds, and she had every right\r\nto wear them. Though two-and-twenty only, she stood there orphan,\r\nheiress, and widow. She had known many changes of condition, but not of\r\nfate, and they did not seem to have affected her much. Of high-born and\r\nproud parentage, she had been an only child for many years before her\r\nparents' death. She had been spoiled, to use a common, but not always\r\nappropriate phrase; for there are some people who cannot be spoiled,\r\neither because the ethereal essence within them is incorruptible, or\r\nbecause there is no ethereal essence to spoil at all. However, she had\r\nbeen spoiled very successfully by fate, fortune, and kind friends. She\r\nhad never been contradicted in her life; she had never been\r\ndisappointed--but once. She had travelled, seen strange countries--which\r\nwas rare in those days with women--had enjoyed many things. She had\r\nmarried a handsome, foolish man, whom she chose--few knew rightly why.\r\nShe had lost both her parents not long after; got tired of her husband,\r\nand lost him too, just when the loss could leave little behind but a\r\ndecent regret, which she cultivated as a slight stimulant to keep her\r\nmind from stagnating. And now, without husband, child, or parents, she\r\nreturned to the house of her childhood, which she had not seen for five\r\nlong years.\r\n\r\nIs that all her history? No, not exactly all. There is one little\r\nincident which may as well be referred to here. Her parents had entered\r\ninto an arrangement for her marriage with a very different man from him\r\nwhom she afterwards chose,--Sir Philip Hastings; and foolishly they had\r\ntold her of what had been done, before the young man's own assent had\r\nbeen given. She did not see much of him--certainly not enough to fall in\r\nlove with him. She even thought him a strange, moody youth; but yet\r\nthere was something in his moodiness and eccentricity which excited her\r\nfancy. The reader knows that he chose for himself; and the lady also\r\nmarried immediately after.\r\n\r\nThus had passed for her a part of life's pageant; and now she came to\r\nher own native dwelling, to let the rest march by as it might. At first,\r\nas she slowly descended from the carriage, her large, dark, brilliant\r\neyes were fixed upon the ground. She had looked long at the house as she\r\nwas driving towards it, and it seemed to have cast her into a thoughtful\r\nmood. It is hardly possible to enter a house where we have spent many\r\nearly years, without finding memory suddenly seize upon the heart and\r\npossess it totally. What a grave it is! What a long line of buried\r\nancestors may not _the present_ always contemplate there.\r\n\r\nNor are there many received into the tomb worth so much respect as one\r\ndead hour. All else shall live again; lost hours have no resurrection.\r\n\r\nThere were old servants waiting around, to welcome her, new ones\r\nattending upon her orders; but for a moment or two she noticed no one,\r\ntill at length the old housekeeper, who knew her from a babe, spoke out,\r\nsaying, \"Ah, madam! I do not wonder to see you a little sad on first\r\ncoming to the old place again, after all that has happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, indeed, Arnold,\" replied the lady, \"many sad things have happened\r\nsince we parted. But how are you, Goody? You look blooming:\" and walking\r\ninto the house, she heard the reply in the hall.\r\n\r\nFrom the hall, the old housekeeper led her lady through the house, and\r\nmightily did she chatter and gossip by the way. The lady listened nearly\r\nin silence; for Mrs. Arnold was generous in conversation, and spared her\r\ncompanion all expense of words. At length, however, something she said\r\nseemed to rouse her mistress, and she exclaimed with a somewhat bitter\r\nlaugh, \"And so the good people declared I was going to be married to Sir\r\nPhilip Hastings?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Mr._ Hastings he was then, madam,\" answered the housekeeper; \"to be\r\nsure they did. All the country around talked of it, and the tenants\r\nlistened at church to hear the banns proclaimed.\"\r\n\r\nThe lady turned very red, and the old woman went on to say, \"Old Sir\r\nJohn seemed quite sure of it; but he reckoned without his host, I\r\nfancy.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did indeed,\" said the lady with an uncheerful smile, and there the\r\nsubject dropped for the time. Not long after, however, the lady herself\r\nbrought the conversation back to nearly the same point, asked after Sir\r\nPhilip's health and manner of living, and how he was liked in the\r\nneighborhood, adding, \"He seemed a strange being at the time I saw him,\r\nwhich was only once or twice--not likely to make a very pleasant\r\nhusband, I thought.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh dear, yes, madam, he does,\" answered Mrs. Arnold, \"many a worse, I\r\ncan assure you. He is very fond of his lady indeed, and gives up more to\r\nher than one would think. He is a little stern, they say, but very just\r\nand upright; and no libertine fellow, like his brother who was\r\ndrowned--which I am sure was a providence, for if he was so bad when he\r\nwas young, what would he have been when he was old?\"\r\n\r\n\"Better, perhaps,\" replied her mistress, with a quiet smile; \"but was he\r\nso very wicked? I never heard any evil of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh dear me, madam! do not you know?\" exclaimed the old woman; and then\r\ncame the whole story of the cotter's daughter on the hill, and how she\r\nand her father and old Mother Danby--whom people believed to be a\r\nwitch--had persuaded or threatened Sir John Hastings into making rich\r\npeople of them.\r\n\r\n\"Persuaded or threatened Sir John Hastings!\" said the lady in a tone of\r\ndoubt. \"I knew him better than either of his sons; and never did I see a\r\nman so little likely to yield to persuasion or to bow to menace;\" and\r\nshe fell into a deep fit of musing, which lasted long, while the old\r\nhousekeeper rambled on from subject to subject, unlistened to, but very\r\nwell content.\r\n\r\nLet us dwell a little on the lady, and on her character. There is always\r\nsomething to interest, something to instruct, in the character of a\r\nwoman. It is like many a problem in Euclid, which seems at first sight\r\nas plain and simple as the broad sunshine; but when we come to study it,\r\nwe find intricacies beneath which puzzle us mightily to resolve. It is a\r\nfine, curious, delicate, complicated piece of anatomy, a woman's heart.\r\nI have dissected many, and I know the fact. Take and lay that fibre\r\napart--take care, for heaven's sake! that you do not tear the one next\r\nto it; and be sure you do not dissever the fragments which bind those\r\nmost opposite parts together! See, here lies a muscle of keen\r\nsensibility; and there--what is that? A cartilage, hard as a nether\r\nmillstone. Look at those light, irritable nerves, quivering at the\r\nslightest touch; and then see those tendons, firm, fixed, and powerful\r\nas the resolution of a martyr. Oh, that wonderful piece of organization!\r\nwho can describe it accurately?\r\n\r\nI must not pretend to do so; but I will give a slight sketch of the\r\nbeing before me.\r\n\r\nThere she stands, somewhat above the usual height, but beautifully\r\nformed, with every line rounded and flowing gracefully into the others.\r\nThere is calmness and dignity in the whole air, and in every movement;\r\nbut yet there is something very firm, very resolute, very considerate,\r\nin the fall of that small foot upon the carpet. She cannot intend her\r\nfoot to stay there for ever; and yet, when she sets it down, one would\r\nbe inclined to think she did. Her face is very beautiful--every feature\r\nfinely cut--the eyes almost dazzling in their dark brightness. How\r\nchaste, how lovely the fine lines of that mouth. Yet do you see what a\r\nhabit she has of keeping the pearly teeth close shut--one pure row\r\npressed hard against the other. The slight sarcastic quiver of the upper\r\nlip does not escape you; and the expanded nostril and flash of the eye,\r\ncontradicted by the fixed motionless mouth.\r\n\r\nSuch is her outward appearance, such is she too within--though the\r\ncomplexion there is somewhat darker. Much that, had it been cultivated\r\nand improved, would have blossomed into womanly virtue; a capability of\r\nlove, strong, fiery, vehement, changeless--not much tenderness--not much\r\npity,--no remorse--are there. Pride, of a peculiar character, but\r\nstrong, ungovernable, unforgiving, and a power of hate and thirst of\r\nvengeance, which only pride can give, are there likewise. Super-add a\r\nshrewdness--a policy--a cunning--nay, something greater--something\r\napproaching the sublime--a divination, where passion is to be gratified,\r\nthat seldom leads astray from the object.\r\n\r\nYes, such is the interior of that fair temple, and yet, how calm, sweet,\r\nand promising it stands.\r\n\r\nI have omitted much perhaps; for the human heart is like the caldron of\r\nthe witches in Macbeth, and one might go on throwing in ingredients till\r\nthe audience became tired of the song. However, what I have said will be\r\nenough for the reader's information; and if we come upon any unexplained\r\nphenomena, I must endeavor to elucidate them hereafter.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose the lady's interview with her housekeeper at an end--all\r\nher domestic arrangements made--the house restored to its air of\r\nhabitation--visits received and paid. Amongst the earliest visitors were\r\nSir Philip and Lady Hastings. He came frankly, and in one of his most\r\nhappy moods, perfectly ignorant that she had ever been made aware of\r\nthere having been a marriage proposed between himself and her; and she\r\nreceived him and his fair wife with every appearance of cordiality. But\r\nas soon as these visits and all the ceremonies were over, the lady began\r\nto drive much about the country, and to collect every tale and rumor she\r\ncould meet with of all the neighboring families. Her closest attention,\r\nhowever, centred upon those affecting the Hastings' race; and she found\r\nthe whole strange story of the cottage girl confirmed, with many another\r\nparticular added. She smiled when she heard this--smiled blandly--it\r\nseemed to give her pleasure. She would fain have called upon the girl\r\nand her mother too. She longed to do so, and to draw forth with skill,\r\nof which she possessed no small share, the key secret of the whole. But\r\nher station, her reputation, prevented her from taking a step which she\r\nknew might be noised abroad and create strange comments.\r\n\r\nShe resolved upon another move, however, which she thought would do as\r\nwell. There would be no objection to her visiting her poorer neighbors,\r\nto comfort, to relieve; and she went to the huts of many. At length one\r\nearly morning, on a clear autumn day, the carriage was left below on the\r\nhigh road, and the lady climbed the hill alone towards the cottage,\r\nwhere the girl and her parents formerly lived. She found the old woman,\r\nwho was now its occupant, busily cooking her morning meal; and sitting\r\ndown, she entered into conversation with her. At first she could obtain\r\nbut little information; the old woman was in a sullen mood, and would\r\nnot speak of any thing she did not like. Money was of no avail to unlock\r\nher eloquence.\r\n\r\nShe had never asked or taken charity, the old woman said, and now she\r\ndid not need it.\r\n\r\nThe lady pondered for a few minutes, considering the character of her\r\nancient hostess, trying it by her experience and intuition; and thus she\r\nboldly asked her for the whole history of young John Hastings and the\r\ncottage girl.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me all,\" she said, \"for I wish to know it--I have an interest in\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay?\" said the old woman, gazing at her, \"then you are the pretty lady\r\nSir Philip was to have married, but would not have her?\"\r\n\r\n\"The same,\" replied the visitor, and for an instant a bright red spot\r\narose upon her cheek--a pang like a knife passed through her heart.\r\n\r\nThat was the price she paid for the gratification of her curiosity. But\r\nit probably was gratified, for she stayed nearly an hour and a half in\r\nthe cottage--so long, indeed, that her servants, who were with the\r\ncarriage, became alarmed, and one of the footmen walked up the hill. He\r\nmet his lady coming down.\r\n\r\n\"Poor thing,\" she said, as if speaking of the old woman she had just\r\nleft, \"her senses wander a little; but she is poor, and has been much\r\npersecuted. I must do what I can for her. Whenever she comes to the\r\nhouse, see she is admitted.\"\r\n\r\nThe old woman did come often, and always had a conference with the lady\r\nof the mansion; but here let us leave them for the present. They may\r\nappear upon the stage again.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n    \"MY DEAR SIR PHILIP:\r\n\r\n\"I have not seen you or dear Lady Hastings for many months; nor your\r\nsweet Emily either, except at a distance, when one day she passed my\r\ncarriage on horseback, sweeping along the hill-side like a gleam of\r\nlight. My life is a sad, solitary one here; and I wish my friends would\r\ntake more compassion upon me and let me see human faces\r\noftener--especially faces that I love.\r\n\r\n\"But I know that you are very inexorable in these respects, and,\r\nsufficient to yourself, cannot readily conceive how a lone woman can\r\npine for the society of other more loving friends than books or nature.\r\nI must, therefore, attack the only accessible point I know about you,\r\nmeaning your compassion, which you never refuse to those who really\r\nrequire it. Now I do require it greatly; for I am at this present\r\nengaged in business of a very painful and intricate nature, which I\r\ncannot clearly understand, and in which I have no one to advise me but a\r\ncountry attorney, whose integrity as well as ability I much doubt. To\r\nwhom can I apply so well as to you, when I need the counsel and\r\nassistance of a friend, equally kind, disinterested, and clear-headed? I\r\nventure to do so, then, in full confidence, and ask you to ride over as\r\nsoon as you can, to give me your advice, or rather to decide for me, in\r\na matter where a considerable amount of property is at stake, and where\r\ndecision is required immediately. I trust when you do come you will stay\r\nall night, as the business is, I fear, of so complicated a nature, that\r\nit may occupy more than one day of your valuable time in the affairs of\r\n\r\n    Your faithful and obliged servant,\r\n\r\n    CAROLINE HAZLETON.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is Mrs. Hazleton's messenger waiting?\" asked Sir Philip Hastings, after\r\nhaving read the letter and mused for a moment.\r\n\r\nThe servant answered in the affirmative; and his master rejoined, \"Tell\r\nhim I will not write an answer, as I have some business to attend to;\r\nbut I beg he will tell his mistress that I will be with her in three\r\nhours.\"\r\n\r\nLady Hastings uttered a low-toned exclamation of surprise. She did not\r\nventure to ask any question--indeed she rarely questioned her husband on\r\nany subject; but when any thing excited her wonder, or, as was more\r\nfrequently the case, her curiosity, she was accustomed to seek for\r\nsatisfaction in a somewhat indirect way, by raising her beautiful\r\neyebrows with a doubtful sort of smile, or, as in the present instance,\r\nby exclaiming, \"Good gracious! Dear me!\" or giving voice to some other\r\nlittle vocative, with a note of interrogation strongly marked after it.\r\n\r\nIn this case there was more than one feeling at the bottom of her\r\nexclamation. She was surprised; she was curious; and she was, moreover,\r\nin the least degree in the world, jealous. She had her share of\r\nweaknesses, as I have said; and one of them was of a kind less uncommon\r\nthan may be supposed. Of her husband's conduct she had no fear--not the\r\nslightest suspicion. Indeed, to have entertained any would have been\r\nimpossible--but she could not bear to see him liked, admired, esteemed,\r\nby any woman--mark me, I say by _any woman_; for no one could feel more\r\ntriumphant joy than she did when she saw him duly appreciated by men.\r\nShe was a great monopolizer: she did not wish one thought of his to be\r\nwon away from her by another woman; and a sort of irritable feeling came\r\nupon her even when she saw him seated by any young and pretty girl, and\r\npaying her the common attentions of society. She was too well bred to\r\ndisplay such sensations except by those slight indications, or by a\r\ncertain petulance of manner, which he was not close observer enough of\r\nother people's conduct to remark.\r\n\r\nNot to dwell too long on such things, Sir Philip Hastings, though\r\nperfectly unconscious of what was going on in her heart, rarely kept her\r\nlong in suspense, when he saw any signs of curiosity. He perhaps might\r\nthink it a point of Roman virtue to spoil his wife, although she had\r\nvery little of the Portia in her character. On the present occasion, he\r\nquietly handed over to her the letter of Mrs. Hazleton; and then\r\nsummoned a servant and gave orders for various preparations.\r\n\r\n\"Had not I and Emily better go with you?\" asked Lady Hastings, pointing\r\nout to him the passage in the letter which spoke of the long absence of\r\nall the family.\r\n\r\n\"Not when I am going on business,\" replied her husband gravely, and\r\nquitted the room.\r\n\r\nAn hour after, Philip Hastings was on horseback with a servant carrying\r\na valise behind him, and riding slowly through the park. The day was far\r\nadvanced, and the distance was likely to occupy about an hour and a half\r\nin travelling; but the gentleman had fallen into a reverie, and rode\r\nvery slowly. They passed the park gates; they took their way down the\r\nlane by the church and near the parsonage. Here Sir Philip pulled in his\r\nhorse suddenly, and ordered the man to ride on and announce that he\r\nwould be at Mrs. Hazleton's soon after. He then fastened his horse to a\r\nlarge hook, put up for the express purpose on most country houses of\r\nthat day in England, and walked up to the door. It was ajar, and without\r\nceremony he walked in, as he was often accustomed to do, and entered the\r\nlittle study of the rector.\r\n\r\nThe clergyman himself was not there; but there were two persons in the\r\nroom, one a young and somewhat dashing-looking man, one or two and\r\ntwenty years of age, exceedingly handsome both in face and figure; the\r\nother personage past the middle age, thin, pale, eager and keen-looking,\r\nin whom Sir Philip instantly recognized a well known, but not very well\r\nreputed attorney, of a country town about twenty miles distant. They had\r\none of the large parish books before them, and were both bending over it\r\nwith great appearance of earnestness.\r\n\r\nThe step of Sir Philip Hastings roused them, and turning round, the\r\nattorney bowed low, saying, \"I give you good day, Sir Philip. I hope I\r\nhave the honor of seeing you well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so,\" was the brief reply, and it was followed by an inquiry for\r\nthe pastor, who it seemed had gone into another room for some papers\r\nwhich were required.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the younger of the two previous occupants of the room\r\nhad been gazing at Sir Philip Hastings with a rude, familiar stare,\r\nwhich the object of it did not remark; and in another moment the\r\nclergyman himself appeared, carrying a bundle of old letters in his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nHe was a heavy, somewhat timid man, the reverse of his predecessor in\r\nall things, but a very good sort of person upon the whole. On seeing the\r\nbaronet there, however, something seemed strangely to affect him--a sort\r\nof confused surprise, which, after various stammering efforts, burst\r\nforth as soon as the usual salutation was over, in the words, \"Pray, Sir\r\nPhilip, did you come by appointment?\"\r\n\r\nSir Philip Hastings, as the reader already knows, was a somewhat\r\nunobservant man of what was passing around him in the world. He had his\r\nown deep, stern trains of thought, which he pursued with a passionate\r\nearnestness almost amounting to monomania. The actions, words, and even\r\nlooks of those few in whom he took an interest, he could sometimes watch\r\nand comment on in his own mind with intense study. True, he watched\r\nwithout understanding, and commented wrongly; for he had too little\r\nexperience of the motives of others from outward observation, and found\r\ntoo little sympathy with the general motives of the world, in his own\r\nheart, to judge even those he loved rightly. But the conduct, the looks,\r\nthe words of ordinary men, he hardly took the trouble of remarking; and\r\nthe good parson's surprise and hesitation, passed like breath upon a\r\nmirror, seen perhaps, but retaining no hold upon his mind for a moment.\r\nNeither did the abrupt question surprise him; nor the quick, angry look\r\nwhich it called up on the face of the attorney attract his notice; but\r\nhe replied quietly to Mr. Dixwell, \"I do not remember having made any\r\nappointment with you.\"\r\n\r\nThe matter was all well so far; and would have continued well; but the\r\nattorney, a meddling fellow, had nearly spoiled all, by calling the\r\nattention of Philip Hastings more strongly to the strangeness of the\r\nclergyman's question.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" said the man of law, interrupting the baronet in the midst,\r\n\"Perhaps Mr. Dixwell thought, Sir Philip, that you came here to speak\r\nwith me on the business of the Honorable Mrs. Hazleton. She told me she\r\nwould consult you, and I can explain the whole matter to you.\"\r\n\r\nBut the clergyman instantly declared that he meant nothing of the kind;\r\nand at the same moment Sir Philip Hastings said, \"I beg you will not,\r\nsir. Mrs. Hazleton will explain what she thinks proper to me, herself. I\r\ndesire no previous information, as I am now on my way to her. Why my\r\ngood friend here should suppose I came by appointment, I cannot tell.\r\nHowever, I did not; and it does not matter. I only wish, Mr. Dixwell, to\r\nsay, that I hear the old woman Danley is ill and dying. She is a papist,\r\nand the foolish people about fancy she is a witch. Little help or\r\ncomfort will she obtain from them, even if they do not injure or insult\r\nher. As I shall be absent all night, and perhaps all to-morrow, I will\r\ncall at her cottage as I ride over to Mrs. Hazleton's and inquire into\r\nher wants. I will put down on paper, and leave there, what I wish my\r\npeople to do for her; but there is one thing which I must request you to\r\ndo, namely, to take every means, by exhortation and remonstrance, to\r\nprevent the ignorant peasantry from troubling this poor creature's\r\ndeath-bed. Her sad errors in matters of faith should only at such a\r\nmoment make us feel the greater compassion for her.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dixwell thought differently, for though a good man, he was a\r\nfanatic. He did not indeed venture to think of disobeying the injunction\r\nof the great man of the parish--the man who now held both the Hastings\r\nand the Marshal property; but he would fain have detained Sir Philip to\r\nexplain and make clear to him the position--as clear as a demonstration\r\nin Euclid to his own mind--that all Roman Catholics ought to be, at the\r\nvery least, banished from the country for ever.\r\n\r\nBut Sir Philip Hastings was not inclined to listen, and although the\r\ngood man began the argument in a solemn tone, his visitor, falling into\r\na fit of thought, walked slowly out of the room, along the passage,\r\nthrough the door, and mounted his horse, without effectually hearing one\r\nword, though they were many which Mr. Dixwell showered upon him as he\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nAt his return to his little study, the parson found the young man and\r\nthe lawyer, no longer looking at the book, but conversing together very\r\neagerly, with excited countenances and quick gestures. The moment he\r\nentered, however, they stopped, the young man ending with an oath, for\r\nwhich the clergyman reproved him on the spot.\r\n\r\n\"That is very well, Mr. Dixwell,\" said the attorney, \"and my young\r\nfriend here will be much the better for some good admonition; and for\r\nsitting under your ministry, as I trust he will, some day soon; but we\r\nmust go I fear directly. However, there is one thing I want to say; for\r\nyou had nearly spoiled every thing to-day. No person playing at cards--\"\r\n\r\n\"I never touch them,\" said the parson, with a holy horror in his face.\r\n\r\n\"Well, others do,\" said the attorney, \"and those who do never show their\r\nhand to their opponent. Now, law is like a game of cards--\"\r\n\r\n\"In which the lawyer is sure to get the odd trick,\" observed the young\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\"And we must not have Sir Philip Hastings know one step that we are\r\ntaking,\" continued the lawyer. \"If you have conscience, as I am sure you\r\nhave, and honor, as I know you have, you will not suffer any thing that\r\nwe have asked you, or said to you, to transpire; for then, of course,\r\nSir Philip would take every means to prevent our obtaining information.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not think it,\" said the parson.\r\n\r\n\"And justice and equity would be frustrated,\" proceeded the attorney,\r\n\"which you are bound by your profession to promote. We want nothing but\r\njustice, Mr. Dixwell: justice, I say; and no one can tell what card Sir\r\nPhilip may play.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will trump it with the knave,\" said the young man to himself; and\r\nhaving again cautioned the clergyman to be secret, not without some\r\nobscure menaces of danger to himself, if he failed, the two gentlemen\r\nleft him, and hurried down, as fast as they could go, to a small\r\nalehouse in the village, where they had left their horses. In a few\r\nminutes, a well known poacher, whose very frequent habitation was the\r\njail or the cage, was seen to issue forth from the door of the alehouse,\r\nthen to lead a very showy looking horse from the stable, and then to\r\nmount him and take his way over the hill. The poacher had never\r\npossessed a more dignified quadruped than a dog or a donkey in his life;\r\nso that it was evident the horse could not be his. That he was not\r\nengaged in the congenial but dangerous occupation of stealing it, was\r\nclear from the fact of the owner of the beast gazing quietly at him out\r\nof the window while he mounted; and then turning round to the attorney,\r\nwho sat at a table hard by, and saying, \"he is off, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let him go,\" replied the lawyer, \"but I do not half like it,\r\nMaster John. Every thing in law should be cool and quiet. No\r\nviolence--no bustle.\"\r\n\r\n\"But this is not a matter of law,\" replied the younger man, \"it is a\r\nmatter of safety, you fool. What might come of it, if he were to have a\r\nlong canting talk with the old wretch upon her death-bed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very little,\" replied the attorney, in a calm well-assured tone, \"I\r\nknow her well. She is as hard as a flint stone. She always was, and time\r\nhas not softened her. Besides, he has no one with him to take\r\ndepositions, and if what you say is true, she'll not live till morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I tell you, she is getting frightened, as she comes near death!\"\r\nexclaimed the young man. \"She has got all sorts of fancies into her\r\nhead; about hell, and purgatory, and the devil knows what; and she spoke\r\nto my mother yesterday about repentance, and atonement, and a pack of\r\nstuff more, and wanted extreme unction, and to confess to a priest. It\r\nwould be a fine salve, I fancy, that could patch up the wounds in her\r\nconscience; but if this Philip Hastings were to come to her with his\r\ngrave face and solemn tone, and frighten her still more, he would get\r\nany thing out of her he pleased.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think it,\" answered the lawyer deliberately; \"hate, Master\r\nJohn, is the longest lived passion I know. It lasts into the grave, as I\r\nhave often seen in making good men's wills when they were\r\ndying--sanctified, good men, I say. Why I have seen a man who has spent\r\nhalf his fortune in charity, and built alms-houses, leave a thoughtless\r\nson, or a runaway daughter, or a plain-spoken nephew, to struggle with\r\npoverty all his life, refusing to forgive him, and comforting himself\r\nwith a text or a pretence. No, no; hate is the only possession that goes\r\nout of the world with a man: and this old witch, Danby, hates the whole\r\nrace of Hastings with a goodly strength that will not decay as her body\r\ndoes. Besides Sir Philip is well-nigh as puritanical as his father--a\r\nsort of cross-breed between an English fanatic and an old Roman cynic.\r\nShe abominates the very sound of his voice, and nothing would reconcile\r\nher to him but his taking the mass and abjuring the errors of Calvin.\r\nHa! ha! ha! However, as you have sent the fellow, it cannot be helped.\r\nOnly remember I had nothing to do with it if violence follows. That man\r\nis not to be trusted, and I like to keep on the safe side of the law.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, doubtless, doubtless,\" answered the youth, somewhat thoughtfully;\r\n\"it is your shield; and better stand behind than before it. However, I\r\ndon't doubt Tom Cutter in the least. Besides, I only told him to\r\ninterrupt them in their talk, and take care they had no private gossip;\r\nto stick there till he was gone, and all that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir Philip is not a man to bear such interruption,\" said the attorney,\r\ngravely; \"he is as quiet looking as the deep sea on a summer's day; but\r\nthere can come storms, I tell you, John, and then woe to those who have\r\ntrusted the quiet look.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, if he gets in a passion, and mischief comes of it,\" replied the\r\nyoung man, with a laugh, \"the fault is his, you know, Shanks.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" answered the attorney, meditating, \"and perhaps, by a little\r\nclever twisting and turning, we might make something of it if he did,\r\nwere there any other person concerned but this Tom Cutter, and we had a\r\ngood serviceable witness or two. But this man is such a rogue that his\r\nword is worth nothing; and to thrash him--though the business of the\r\nbeadle--would be no discredit to the magistrate. Besides, he is sure to\r\ngive the provocation, and one word of Sir Philip's would be worth a\r\nthousand oaths of Tom Cutter's, in any court in the kingdom.\"\r\n\r\n\"As to thrashing him, that few can do,\" replied the youth; \"but only\r\nremember, Shanks, that I gave no orders for violence.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was not present,\" replied the attorney, with a grin; \"you had better,\r\nby a great deal, trust entirely to me, in these things, Master John. If\r\nyou do, I will bring you safely through, depend upon it; but if you do\r\nnot, nobody can tell what may come. Here comes Folwell, the sexton. Now\r\nhold your tongue, and let me manage him, sir. You are not acquainted\r\nwith these matters.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nDid you ever examine an ant-hill, dear reader? What a wonderful little\r\ncosmos it is--what an epitome of a great city--of the human race! See\r\nhow the little fellows run bustling along upon their several\r\nbusinesses--see how some get out of each other's way, how others jostle,\r\nand others walk over their fellows' heads! But especially mark that\r\nblack gentleman, pulling hard to drag along a fat beetle's leg and\r\nthigh, three times as large as his own body. He cannot get it on, do\r\nwhat he will; and yet he tugs away, thinking it a very fine haunch\r\nindeed. He does not perceive, what is nevertheless the fact, that there\r\nare two others of his own race pulling at the other end, and thus\r\nfrustrating all his efforts.\r\n\r\nAnd thus it is with you, and me, and every one in the wide world. We\r\nwork blindly, unknowing the favoring or counteracting causes that are\r\nconstantly going on around us, to facilitate or impede our endeavors.\r\nThe wish to look into futurity is vain, irrational, almost impious; but\r\nwhat a service would it be to any man if he could but get a sight into\r\nFate's great workshop, and see only that part in which the events are on\r\nthe anvil that affect our own proceedings. Still, even if we did, we\r\nmight not understand the machinery after all, and only burn or pinch our\r\nfingers in trying to put pieces together which fate did not intend to\r\nfit.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time--that is to say while the attorney and his companion\r\nwere talking together at the alehouse--Sir Philip Hastings rode quietly\r\nup the hill to the cottage I have before described, and therefore shall\r\nnot describe again, merely noticing that it now presented an appearance\r\nof neatness and repair which it had not before possessed. He tied his\r\nhorse to the palings, walked slowly up the little path, gazing right and\r\nleft at the cabbages and carrots on either side, and then without\r\nceremony went in.\r\n\r\nThe cottage had two tenants at this time, the invalid old woman, and\r\nanother, well-nigh as old but less decrepit, who had been engaged to\r\nattend upon her in her sickness. How she got the money to pay her no one\r\nknew, for her middle life and the first stage of old age had been marked\r\nby poverty and distress; but somehow money seems to have a natural\r\naffinity for old age. It grows upon old people, I think, like corns; and\r\ncertainly she never wanted money now.\r\n\r\nThere she was, lying in her bed, a miserable object indeed to see. She\r\nwas like a woman made of fungus--not of that smooth, putty-like, fleshy\r\nfungus which grows in dank places, but of the rough, rugged, brown,\r\ncarunculated sort which rises upon old stumps of trees and dry-rot\r\ngate-posts. Teeth had departed nearly a quarter of a century before, and\r\nthe aquiline features had become more hooked and beaky for their loss;\r\nbut the eyes had now lost their keen fire, and were dull and filmy.\r\n\r\nThe attorney was quite right. Hate was the last thing to go out in the\r\nashes where the spark of life itself lingered but faintly. At first she\r\ncould not see who it was entered the cottage; for the sight now reached\r\nbut a short distance from her own face. But the sound of his voice, as\r\nhe inquired of the other old woman how she was going on, at once showed\r\nher who it was, and hate at least roused \"the dull cold ear of death.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment or two she lay muttering sounds which seemed to have no\r\nmeaning; but at length she said, distinctly enough, \"Is that Philip\r\nHastings?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my poor woman,\" said the baronet; \"is there any thing I can do for\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come nearer, come nearer,\" she replied, \"I cannot see you plainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am close to you, nevertheless,\" he answered. \"I am touching the bed\r\non which you lie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me feel you,\" continued she--\"give me your hand.\"\r\n\r\nHe did as she asked him; and holding by his hand, she made a great\r\nstruggle to raise herself in bed; but she could not, and lay exhausted\r\nfor a minute before she spoke again.\r\n\r\nAt length, however, she raised her voice louder and shriller than\r\nbefore--\"May a curse rest upon this hand and upon that head!\" she\r\nexclaimed; \"may the hand work its own evil, and the head its own\r\ndestruction! May the child of your love poison your peace, and make you\r\na scoff, and a by-word, and a shame! May the wife of your bosom perish\r\nby----\"\r\n\r\nBut Sir Philip Hastings withdrew his hand suddenly, and an unwonted\r\nflush came upon his cheek.\r\n\r\n\"For shame!\" he said, in a low stern tone, \"for shame!\"\r\n\r\nThe next moment, however, he recovered himself perfectly; and turning to\r\nthe nurse he added, \"Poor wretch! my presence only seems to excite evil\r\nfeelings which should long have passed away, and are not fit counsellors\r\nfor the hour of death. If there be any thing which can tend to her\r\nbodily comfort that the hall can supply, send up for it. The servants\r\nhave orders. Would that any thing could be done for her spiritual\r\ncomfort; for this state is terrible to witness.\"\r\n\r\n\"She often asks for a priest, your worship,\" said the nurse. \"Perhaps if\r\nshe could see one she might think better before she died.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas, I doubt it,\" replied the visitor; \"but at all events we cannot\r\nafford her that relief. No such person can be found here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, Sir Philip,\" said the old woman, with a good deal of\r\nhesitation; \"they do say that at Carrington, there is--there is what\r\nthey call a seminary.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not mean a papist college!\" exclaimed the baronet, with\r\nunfeigned surprise and consternation.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear, no sir,\" replied the nurse, \"only a gentleman--a seminary--a\r\nseminary priest, I think they call it; a papist certainly; but they say\r\nhe is a very good gentleman, all but that.\"\r\n\r\nSir Philip mused for a minute or two, and then turned to the door,\r\nsaying, \"Methinks it is hard that a dying woman cannot have the\r\nconsolations of the rites of her own faith--mummery though they be. As a\r\nmagistrate, my good woman, I can give no authority in this business. You\r\nmust do as you think fit. I myself know of no priest in this\r\nneighborhood, or I should be bound to cause his apprehension. I shall\r\ntake no notice of your word, however, and as to the rest, you must, as I\r\nhave said, act as you think fit. I did not make the laws, and I may\r\nthink them cruel. Did I make them, I would not attempt to shackle the\r\nconscience of any one. Farewell,\" and passing through the door, he\r\nremounted his horse and rode away.\r\n\r\nIt was in the early autumn time of the year, and the scene was\r\npeculiarly lovely. I have given a slight description of it before, but I\r\nmust pause and dwell upon it once more, even as Sir Philip Hastings\r\npaused and dwelt upon its loveliness at that moment, although he had\r\nseen and watched it a thousand times before. He was not very impressible\r\nby fine scenery. Like the sages of Laputa, his eyes were more frequently\r\nturned inwards than outwards; but there was something in that landscape\r\nwhich struck a chord in his heart, that is sure to vibrate easily in the\r\nheart of every one of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nIt was peculiarly English--I might say singularly English; for I have\r\nnever seen any thing of exactly the same character anywhere else but in\r\nOld England--except indeed in New England, where I know not whether it\r\nbe from the country having assimilated itself to the people, or from the\r\npeople having chosen the country from the resemblance to their own\r\npaternal dwelling place, many a scene strikes the eye which brings back\r\nto the wandering Englishman all the old, dear feelings of his native\r\nland, and for a moment he may well forget that the broad Atlantic rolls\r\nbetween him and the home of his youth.\r\n\r\nBut let me return to my picture. Sir Philip Hastings sat upon his\r\nhorse's back, very nearly at the summit of the long range of hills which\r\nbisected the county in which he dwelt. I have described, in mentioning\r\nhis park, the sandy character of the soil on the opposite slope of the\r\nrise; but here higher up, and little trodden by pulverizing feet, the\r\nsandstone rock itself occasionally broke out in rugged maps,\r\ndiversifying the softer characteristics of the scene. Wide, and far\r\naway, on either hand, the eye could wander along the range, catching\r\nfirst upon some bold mass of hill, or craggy piece of ground, assuming\r\nalmost the character of a cliff, seen in hard and sharp distinctness,\r\nwith its plume of trees and coronet of yellow gorse, and then,\r\nproceeding onward to wave after wave, the sight rested upon the various\r\nprojecting points, each softer and softer as they receded, like the\r\nmemories of early days, till the last lines of the wide sweep left the\r\nmind doubtful whether they were forms of earth or clouds, or merely\r\nfancy.\r\n\r\nSuch was the scene on either hand, but straightforward it was very\r\ndifferent, but still quite English. Were you ever, reader, borne to the\r\ntop of a very high wave in a small boat, and did you ever, looking down\r\nthe watery mountain, mark how the steep descent, into the depth below,\r\nwas checkered by smaller waves, and these waves again by ripples? Such\r\nwas the character of the view beneath the feet of the spectator. There\r\nwas a gradual, easy descent from the highest point of the whole county\r\ndown to a river-nurtured valley, not unbroken, but with lesser and\r\nlesser waves of earth, varying the aspect of the scene. These waves\r\nagain were marked out, first by scattered and somewhat stunted trees,\r\nthen by large oaks and chestnuts, not undiversified by the white and\r\ngleaming bark of the graceful birch. A massive group of birches here and\r\nthere was seen; a scattered cottage, too, with its pale bluish wreath of\r\nsmoke curling up over the tree-tops. Then, on the lower slope of all,\r\ncame hedgerows of elms, with bright, green rolls of verdant turf\r\nbetween; the spires of churches; the roofs and white walls of many sorts\r\nof man's dwelling-places, and gleams of a bright river, with two or\r\nthree arches of a bridge. Beyond that again appeared a rich wide\r\nvalley--I might almost have called it a plain, all in gay confusion,\r\nwith fields, and houses, and villages, and trees, and streams, and\r\ntowns, mixed altogether in exquisite disorder, and tinted with all the\r\nvariety of colors and shades that belong to autumn and to sunset.\r\n\r\nDown the descent, the eye of Sir Philip Hastings could trace several\r\nroads and paths, every step of which he knew, like daily habits. There\r\nwas one, a bridle-way from a town about sixteen miles distant, which,\r\nclimbing the hills almost at its outset, swept along the whole range,\r\nabout midway between the summit and the valley. Another, by which he had\r\ncome, and along which he intended to proceed, traversed the crest of the\r\nhills ere it reached the cottage, and then descended with a wavy line\r\ninto the valley, crossing the bridle-path I have mentioned. A wider\r\npath--indeed it might be called a road, though it was not a\r\nturnpike--came over the hills from the left, and with all those easy\r\ngraceful turns which Englishmen so much love in their highways, and\r\nFrenchmen so greatly abhor, descended likewise into the valley, to the\r\nsmall market-town, glimpses of which might be caught over the tops of\r\nthe trees. As the baronet sat there on horseback, and looked around,\r\nmore than one living object met his eye. To say nothing of some sheep\r\nwandering along the uninclosed part of the hill, now stopping to nibble\r\nthe short grass, now trotting forward for a sweeter bite,--not to notice\r\nthe oxen in the pastures below, there was a large cart slowly winding\r\nits way along an open part of the road, about half a mile distant, and\r\nupon the bridle-path which I have mentioned, the figure of a single\r\nhorseman was seen, riding quietly and easily along, with a sauntering\r\nsort of air, which gave the beholder at once the notion that he was what\r\nSterne would have called a \"picturesque traveller,\" and was enjoying the\r\nprospect as he went.\r\n\r\nOn the road that came over the hill from the left, was another rider of\r\nvery different demeanor, going along at a rattling pace, and apparently\r\nsomewhat careless of his horse's knees.\r\n\r\nThe glance which Sir Philip Hastings gave to either of them was but\r\nslight and hasty. His eyes were fixed upon the scene before him,\r\nfeeling, rather than understanding, its beauties, while he commented in\r\nhis mind, after his own peculiar fashion. I need not trace the\r\nprocession of thought through his brain. It ended, however, with the\r\nhalf uttered words,\r\n\r\n\"Strange, that such a land should have produced so many scoundrels,\r\ntyrants, and knaves!\"\r\n\r\nHe then slowly urged his horse forward, down the side of the hill, soon\r\nreached some tall trees, where the inclosures and hedgerows commenced,\r\nand was approaching the point at which the road he was travelling,\r\ncrossed the bridle-path, when he heard some loud, and as it seemed to\r\nhim, angry words, between two persons he could not see.\r\n\r\n\"I will soon teach you that;\" cried a loud, coarse tongue, adding an\r\nexceedingly blasphemous oath, which I will spare the reader.\r\n\r\n\"My good friend,\" replied another milder voice, \"I neither desire to be\r\ntaught any thing, just now, nor would you be the teacher I should chose,\r\nif I did, though perchance, in case of need, I might give you a lesson,\r\nwhich would be of some service to you.\"\r\n\r\nSir Philip rode on, and the next words he heard were spoken by the first\r\nvoice, to the following effect; \"Curse me, if I would not try that, only\r\nmy man might get off in the mean time; and I have other business in hand\r\nthan yours. Otherwise I would give you such a licking in two minutes,\r\nyou would be puzzled to find a white spot on your skin for the next\r\nmonth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two minutes would not detain you long,\" replied the calmer voice, \"and,\r\nas I have never had such a beating, I should like to see, first, whether\r\nyou could give it, and secondly, what it would be like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon my soul, you are cool!\" exclaimed the first speaker with another\r\noath.\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly,\" replied the second; and, at the same moment, Sir Philip\r\nHastings emerged from among the trees, at the point where the two roads\r\ncrossed, and where the two speakers were face to face before his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe one, who was in truth the sauntering traveller whom he has seen\r\nwending along the bridle-path, was a tall, good-looking young man, of\r\nthree or four and twenty years of age. In the other, the Baronet had no\r\ndifficulty in recognizing at once, Tom Cutter, the notorious poacher and\r\nbruiser, whom he had more than once had the satisfaction of committing\r\nto jail. To see him mounted on a very fine powerful horse, was a matter\r\nof no slight surprise to Sir Philip; but, naturally concluding that he\r\nhad stolen it, and was making off with his prize for sale to the\r\nneighboring town, he rode forward and put himself right in the way,\r\ndetermined to stop him.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay! Here is my man!\" cried Tom Cutter, as soon as he saw him. \"I\r\nwill settle with him first, and then for you, my friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, to an old proverb, first come must be first served,\" replied\r\nthe traveller, pushing his horse forward a few steps.\r\n\r\n\"Keep the peace, in the King's name!\" exclaimed Sir Philip Hastings. \"I,\r\nas a magistrate, charge you, sir, to assist me in apprehending this\r\nman!--Thomas Cutter, get off that horse!\"\r\n\r\nThe only reply was a coarse and violent expletive, and a blow with a\r\nthick heavy stick, aimed right at Sir Philip's head. The magistrate put\r\nup his arm, which received the blow, and was nearly fractured by it; but\r\nat the same moment, the younger traveller spurred forward his horse upon\r\nthe ruffian, and with one sweep of his arm struck him to the ground.\r\n\r\nTom Cutter was upon his feet again in a moment. He was accustomed to\r\nhard blows, and like the immortal hero of Butler, could almost tell the\r\nquality of the stick he was beat withal. He was not long in discovering,\r\ntherefore, that the fist which struck him was of no ordinary weight, and\r\nwas directed with skill as well as with vigor; but he was accustomed to\r\nmake it his boast, that he had never taken a licking \"from any man,\"\r\nwhich vanity caused him at once to risk such another blow, in the hope\r\nof having his revenge.\r\n\r\nRushing upon the young stranger then, stick in hand, he prepared to\r\nknock him from his horse; for the other appeared to have no defensive\r\narms, but a slight hazel twig, pulled from a hedge.\r\n\r\n\"He will jump off the other side of his horse,\" thought Tom Cutter; \"and\r\nthen, if he do, I'll contrive to knock the nag over upon him. I know\r\nthat trick, well enough.\"\r\n\r\nBut the stranger disappointed him. Instead of opposing the horse between\r\nhim and his assailant, he sprung with one bound out of the saddle, on\r\nthe side next to the ruffian himself, caught the uplifted stick with one\r\nhand, and seized the collar of the bruiser's coat with the other.\r\n\r\nTom Cutter began to suspect he had made a mistake; but, knowing that at\r\nsuch close quarters the stick would avail him little, and that strength\r\nof thews and sinews would avail him much, he dropped the cudgel, and\r\ngrappled with the stranger in return.\r\n\r\nIt was all the work of a moment. Sir Philip Hastings had no time to\r\ninterfere. There was a momentary struggle, developing the fine\r\nproportions and great strength and skill of the wrestlers; and then, Tom\r\nCutter lay on his back upon the ground. The next instant, the victor put\r\nhis foot upon his chest, and kept the ruffian forcibly down,\r\nnotwithstanding all is exclamations of \"Curse me, that isn't fair! When\r\nyou give a man a fall, let him get up again!\"\r\n\r\n\"If he is a fair fighter, I do,\" replied the other; \"but when he plays\r\npirate, I don't--\" Then turning to Sir Philip Hastings, who had by this\r\ntime dismounted, he said, \"What is to be done with this fellow, sir? It\r\nseems he came here for the express purpose of assaulting you, for he\r\nbegan his impertinence, with asking if you had passed, giving a very\r\naccurate description of your person, and swearing you should find every\r\ndog would have his day.\"\r\n\r\n\"His offence towards myself,\" replied the Baronet, \"I will pass over,\r\nfor it seems to me, he has been punished enough in his own way; but I\r\nsuspect he has stolen this horse. He is a man of notoriously bad\r\ncharacter, who can never have obtained such an animal by honest means.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I didn't steal him, I vow and swear,\" cried the ruffian, in a\r\npiteous tone; for bullies are almost always cravens; \"he was lent to me\r\nby Johny Groves--some call him another name; but that don't signify.--He\r\nlent him to me, to come up here, to stop your gab with the old woman,\r\nMother Danty; and mayhap to give you a good basting into the bargain.\r\nBut I didn't steal the horse no how; and there he is, running away over\r\nthe hill-side, and I shall never catch him; for this cursed fellow has\r\nwell nigh broken my back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Served you quite right, my friend,\" replied the stranger, still keeping\r\nhim tightly down with his foot. \"How came you to use a cudgel to a man\r\nwho had none? Take my advice, another time, and know your man before you\r\nmeddle with him.\"\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Sir Philip Hastings had fallen into a profound reverie,\r\nonly repeating to himself the words \"John Groves.\" Now the train of\r\nthought which was awakened in his mind, though not quite new, was\r\nunpleasant to him; for the time when he first became familiar with that\r\nname was immediately subsequent to the opening of his father's will, in\r\nwhich had been found a clause ordering the payment of a considerable sum\r\nof money to some very respectable trustees, for the purpose of\r\npurchasing an annuity in favor of one John Groves, then a minor.\r\n\r\nThere had been something about the clause altogether which the son and\r\nheir of Sir John Hastings could not understand, and did not like.\r\nHowever, the will enjoined him generally to make no inquiry whatsoever\r\ninto the motives of any of the bequests, and with his usual stern\r\nrigidity in what he conceived right, he had not only asked no questions,\r\nbut had stopped bluntly one of the trustees, who was about to enter\r\ninto some explanations. The money was paid according to directions\r\nreceived, and he had never heard the name of John Groves from that\r\nmoment till it issued from the lips of the ruffian upon the present\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n\"What the man says may be true,\" said Sir Philip Hastings, at length;\r\n\"there is a person of the name he mentions. I know not how I can have\r\noffended him. It may be as well to let him rise and catch his horse if\r\nhe can; but remember, Master Cutter, my eye is upon you; two competent\r\nwitnesses have seen you in possession of that horse, and if you attempt\r\nto sell him, you will hang for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know better than to do that,\" said the bruiser, rising stiffly from\r\nthe ground as the stranger withdrew his foot; \"but I can tell you, Sir\r\nPhilip, others have their eyes upon you, so you had better look to\r\nyourself. You hold your head mightily top high, just now: but it may\r\nchance to come down.\"\r\n\r\nSir Philip Hastings did not condescend to reply, even by a look; but\r\nturning to the stranger, as if the man's words had never reached his\r\near, he said, \"I think we had better ride on, sir. You seem to be going\r\nmy way. Night is falling fast, and in this part of the country two is\r\nsometimes a safer number to travel with than one.\"\r\n\r\nThe other bowed his head gravely, and remounting their horses they\r\nproceeded on the way before them, while Tom Cutter, after giving up some\r\nfive minutes to the condemnation of the eyes, limbs, blood, and soul of\r\nhimself and several other persons, proceeded to catch the horse which he\r\nhad been riding as fast as he could. But the task proved a difficult\r\none.\r\n\r\nTO BE CONTINUED.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[24] Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1850, by G. P.

GEORGES.\r\n\r\n_Continued from page 60._\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THIRD.\r\n\r\nWe left young Rovero in despair, yielding to the stupefaction which\r\noverpowered him, just as the singer leaned over his bed to be assured\r\nthat he was asleep. La Felina looked at him for some time in silence,\r\nwith pity in her eyes. \"Why does he love me?\" said she; \"what have I\r\ndone? why should this poor lad love one who scarcely knew him?\"\r\n\r\nRovero moved. \"Heavens! is the effect of the narcotic over? Will he\r\nawaken?\"\r\n\r\n\"Felina!\" murmured Taddeo.\r\n\r\n\"My name ever on his lips and in his heart. Yes! I was right in avoiding\r\nanother interview: this letter tells all.\" She took a paper from her\r\nbosom. \"But if he resist my prayer, if he shrink from the duty imposed\r\non him by honor and humanity! He alone can accomplish it--all my hope is\r\nin him!\"\r\n\r\nShe approached the table, and by the pale moonlight looked at the flask\r\nof Massa wine. A single glass had been taken from it. \"_One glass!_\"\r\nsaid she, \"_only one glass?_ His sleep cannot be long. This torpor will\r\nterminate before any one enters his cell. But Lippiani the turnkey is\r\ndevoted to me, and will see nothing.\"\r\n\r\nDrawing near the bed she took out of her fine hair a long gold pin, with\r\nwhich to fasten the letter on his pillow, so that his eyes would rest on\r\nit when he awoke. While Felina's face was near Rovero's as she put the\r\nletter beneath his head, her warm breath hung on his lips; they pressed\r\nhers, and, terrified, she sprang from his side.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner dreamed of happiness, and doubted not that his fancy was\r\nrealized. Whether this kiss had overcome his torpor, or whether, as La\r\nFelina thought, the narcotic had been taken in such small quantity that\r\nit had produced but a slight effect, Taddeo tossed on his bed. The\r\nsinger, terrified at these signs, which were the precursors of his\r\nawakening, disappeared by the secret passages through which she had\r\nentered. An hour rolled by before Taddeo could triumph over his sleep.\r\nHis heavy eyes shut together in spite of himself, and his eyelashes\r\nrested on each other. All sensation was lost in general lassitude. In\r\nthe first disorder of his mind, he asked himself if he had not again\r\ndreamed of the appearance of La Felina. Had he not seen her approaching\r\nhis bed just as he sunk to sleep, he would have been sure of it. He\r\nshuddered at the thought that he had lost the opportunity so anxiously\r\nexpected. At last he recovered his strength, and attempted to rise. As\r\nhe did so, his hand touched La Felina's letter on the pillow. When he\r\ndrew out the diamond-headed pin which fastened it, he no longer doubted\r\nthat he had actually seen her. Having been unable to rouse him, she had\r\nwritten to him. He felt angry with himself. He would have given ten\r\nyears of his life to regain that one lost hour. He went to the tall\r\nwindow of the chapel to invoke a single ray of the moon to enable him to\r\nread the lines which had been traced by the hand of the woman he\r\nworshipped. This consolation was denied him. The moon was hidden by\r\nclouds, and the completest obscurity pervaded the prison. What Taddeo\r\nsuffered during the time till day, which it seemed to him would never\r\ndawn, may be fancied, but not described. His fate was in his own hands,\r\nyet it was unknown. Ardently clasping to his heart and to his lips the\r\nperfumed paper on which Felina had written, his heart became\r\nintoxicated. He passionately kissed the sheet on which the singer had\r\nleft her words, and a sad presentiment of misfortune took possession of\r\nhim. He almost feared the coming of day, the light of which would reveal\r\nto him his fate.\r\n\r\nDay dawned, at first feeble, then brighter, and still brighter, and\r\nfinally brilliant and clear. He opened the letter, and his eyes glanced\r\nover it with tender earnestness. A livid pallor overcast his features, a\r\nnervous tremor shook him. The lines traced by La Felina he could not\r\nread; and overcome by despair, he sank to his seat. The keeper entered.\r\n\"Signor,\" said he to Taddeo, \"the person who visited you three days ago\r\nasks permission to see you again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is he?\" said Taddeo--his voice choked with grief.\r\n\r\n\"The Marquis de Maulear.\"\r\n\r\nThe name recalled to the prisoner his mother and Aminta. This memory\r\nsoothed his wounded heart. \"My mother, my sister,\" thought he; \"but for\r\ntheir tenderness what now would be my life! Show the Marquis in.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the keeper was absent, he hurried to the bed, examined it\r\nanxiously as if in search for something which had escaped his\r\nobservation. Seizing the letter, he read anxiously the last lines,\r\napproached the bed, and discovered the mysterious deposit La Felina had\r\nplaced under the pillow. He took it and concealed it carefully in his\r\nclothing; and with an accent which betrayed the contest in his crushed\r\nheart, he said aloud, as if he wished some one to hear him, \"You judged\r\nme correctly, Felina; misfortune will not make me unjust; I will do what\r\nyou ask!\"\r\n\r\nA cry of joy echoed beneath the vault of the old chapel. Taddeo turned.\r\nThe cry had penetrated his heart. But he was alone. Just then Henri de\r\nMaulear entered.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday evening, Signor Rovero, confiding your promise, I informed\r\nthe minister that, consulting with prudent reflections, you would accept\r\nthe pardon offered by the King. You are free, and can now accompany me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us hurry to my mother, Monsieur,\" said Taddeo, casting one last\r\nlook on the chapel walls, which had shut up so much sorrow, happiness\r\nand torment. He followed the Marquis. An hour afterwards two gentlemen\r\non noble English steeds--the best the stables of the Marquis\r\nafforded--rode toward Sorrento. One of these riders, Rovero, was\r\nmelancholy, so that even the French amiability of the Marquis could not\r\ndivert him from gloomy meditations. Ever and anon a smile hung on his\r\nlips, till chased away by some painful memory. The Marquis de Maulear,\r\nsatisfied that Taddeo concealed a secret from him, avoided any allusion\r\nto it, with the delicacy and good taste which above all things fears\r\nindiscretion. He feigned to attribute to the reserve of a new\r\nacquaintance his companion's coldness and absence of mind. For his own\r\npart, delighted at being able to restore this prodigal son to the\r\nparental roof, anxious to see her whom he loved (to whom, relying on\r\nTaddeo's promise, he had gone the evening before to announce her\r\nbrother's return), he could scarcely repress his delight.\r\n\r\n\"Signor,\" said he to Taddeo, at a moment when the state of the road\r\nforced them to slacken their pace, \"we have arranged all: we have left\r\nthe festivities and pleasures of Naples, and have nothing to say of your\r\nsuffering and captivity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not one word, Monsieur, if you please, either of what I have passed\r\nthrough, or of the sufferings of my friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think your mother and sister know nothing of what you have undergone.\r\nHad they, their suffering and alarm would have been great. But do not\r\nflatter yourself that the arrest of Count Monte-Leone is unknown to\r\nthem. One of the Neapolitan papers informed them yesterday of that fact;\r\nand I do not hide from you, that in my presence, your mother deplored\r\nyour unfortunate intimacy with one so adventurous and rash.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what said Aminta?\" asked Rovero anxiously, as if struck by a\r\nthought, which hitherto had escaped him.\r\n\r\n\"Signorina said nothing,\" observed Maulear, with an air of surprise;\r\n\"and he heard the news with the most perfect indifference.\"\r\n\r\n\"To him she is unchanged,\" murmured Rovero.\r\n\r\nLow as was the tone in which this was uttered, Maulear heard it, and\r\ncould not repress the question, which he put with great anxiety, \"To\r\nwhom is the Signorina always the same?\"\r\n\r\n\"To him--to the Count,\" said Taddeo. \"I confide to you almost a family\r\nsecret. Count Monte-Leone deeply loves my sister. He never told me so,\r\nbut it is the case. If he be restored to liberty, as his friends hope,\r\nit will be a good match for Aminta.\"\r\n\r\nEvery word of Rovero fell like a drop of boiling oil on the heart of\r\nMaulear.\r\n\r\n\"My father,\" said Taddeo, \"left us but a moderate fortune. Perhaps some\r\nday we may be rich--richer than the Monte-Leone--for we are the only\r\nheirs of the Roman Cardinal Justiniani, my mother's brother, who, as\r\neldest son, inherited all the property of my maternal grandfather. As\r\nyet, however, our fortune in small, though sufficient for my tastes and\r\nideas. But my mother and sister have other notions; and the marriage of\r\nAminta and Count Monte-Leone would assure her a magnificent and\r\nbrilliant portion.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if your sister does not love Count Monte-Leone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Her refusal would make two persons unhappy; first the Count of\r\nMonte-Leone, and in the second place----\"\r\n\r\n\"And in the second place?\" said Maulear.\r\n\r\n\"Myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yourself!\" said Maulear, with surprise; \"Are you intent on their\r\nmarriage?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Taddeo, with emotion; \"now, all my happiness depends on\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nMaulear was amazed at these singular words. Scarcely had they been\r\nuttered, when Taddeo spurred his horse sharply, and rode toward the\r\nhouse of his mother, which he saw a few hundred yards distant. Henri\r\nfollowed him, troubled, and for the first time, with a care-marked brow,\r\npaused at Aminta's door. A fond mother clasped her son to her bosom,\r\nwith that pleasure which a mother only knows. Aminta, entirely recovered\r\nfrom her accident, kissed her brother affectionately.\r\n\r\n\"My son,\" said Madame Rovero to Taddeo, as she clasped the hand of\r\nMaulear, \"beyond all doubt the Marquis has told you what we owe him.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Marquis has only told me how devoted he was to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Aminta, \"I will be less discreet.\" With exquisite grace she\r\ntold Taddeo all that had passed.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Monsieur,\" said he, opening his arms to the Marquis, \"I would I\r\ncould find some dearer name than friend to give you.\"\r\n\r\nAminta blushed, and looked down. Maulear saw the motion, and a gentle\r\nhope stole over him. The name which Taddeo could not think of, perhaps,\r\nsuggested itself to Aminta. It was the name Maulear was so anxious to\r\ngive Rovero.\r\n\r\nAminta's brother wished to see the courageous child who had so\r\nheroically sacrificed himself for her. All followed Signora Rovero to\r\nthe room of the invalid. He was better. The great inflammation of his\r\nface had disappeared, and his eyes had returned to their orbits.\r\nApparently he was rapidly recovering; but the cruel prediction of the\r\nphysician seemed about to be verified: _He will live, but will never\r\nspeak again_. Only harsh and broken sounds escaped the invalid's lips.\r\n\r\nAminta, who had become Scorpione's nurse as soon as she was able to\r\nleave her room, had already learned to discriminate between the\r\nmodulations of his voice. A kind of mute groan called her to him; a hiss\r\nexpressed pain or impatience; but when his violent and almost savage\r\nnature was excited, a terrible bellowing was heard, and the bravest\r\nheart might quail at the inhuman sound. Tonio was asleep when the\r\nvisitors entered his room, but he awoke, and without seeming surprised\r\nat the curious faces that surrounded his bed, looked at them earnestly.\r\n\r\nHe first recognized Taddeo, and a contraction of his lips, which, bent\r\nfrom their deformity, might have been called a smile, testified his\r\npleasure at the visit. Aminta's presence always produced a strange\r\neffect on Scorpione, which his inability to speak enhanced. His eyes, of\r\npale green, became suddenly lighted up with a peculiar and gentle\r\nlanguor, which was so tender that they seemed almost attractive. This\r\nsingular magnetism had a novel effect on the invalid. But his brow soon\r\nbecame contracted; a violent storm seemed to agitate his heart; and the\r\nhissing was heard.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Taddeo. Aminta said she did not know. He had\r\nperhaps some new suffering, or something put him out of humor. Following\r\nthe direction of Tonio's eyes, she saw they rested sparkling and bright\r\non those of Maulear. Aminta quailed, and Henri, who saw her tremble,\r\nhurried to sustain her. He thought the strength of the young\r\nconvalescent needed this aid. But at the moment when the girl accepted\r\nthe arm of Maulear, Scorpione rose and uttered the horrible cry by which\r\nhe expressed his impotent fury. All shuddered as they heard him. Aminta\r\nlet go Maulear's arm, and quickly sought, by gesture and words, to\r\nsoothe the Cretin, as she would appease an angry child. He became\r\nsoothed at once, and Signora Rovero left him, followed by Taddeo,\r\nMaulear, and Aminta; but Aminta did not take Maulear's arm.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. A NIGHT AT SORRENTO.\r\n\r\nA feeling of uneasiness had suddenly taken possession of Maulear while\r\nin the presence of Aminta and Tonio. But he had not remarked the smile\r\nof happiness which played on the features of the invalid when Aminta,\r\nwith the most natural air in the world, took the arm of her mother\r\ninstead of his own.\r\n\r\n\"Signor,\" said Aminta's mother to the Marquis, as they went into the\r\nhall, \"do not suffer this festival in honor of the return of my son to\r\nbe celebrated without your presence. Share our family meal, and be\r\nsatisfied that in doing so you will gratify us all.\"\r\n\r\nThe offer delighted Maulear, and time flew by with the rapidity love\r\nonly confers on it when passed in the presence of loved ones.\r\n\r\nAbout dinner time two strangers came to the villa, the Count Brignoli\r\nand his son. The Count was an old minister of war of Murat, and had been\r\na colleague of Taddeo's father. He was one of the best friends of\r\nRovero's widow and daughter. A country neighbor, he often visited them.\r\nHis son Gaetano had been educated and brought up with Aminta, and a\r\nclose friendship had been the consequence. Gaetano was twenty years of\r\nage, and his features bore the imprint of masculine and impressive\r\nNeapolitan beauty, deficient neither in the dark locks nor black though\r\nsomewhat glassy eye, which is as it were the ordinary seal of the\r\ncountenances of the men of the south.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of these visitors displeased Maulear. The beauty of Gaetano\r\nstruck him unpleasantly. The intimacy between Aminta and the young man,\r\nthough thus explained, wounded him. During the whole day he fancied that\r\nhe discovered a thousand of those little trifles which a lover treasures\r\nup so carefully, and also that Aminta seemed happy in his presence. His\r\nanxiety had begun to pass away, when a new circumstance revived it.\r\nAminta, who was a perfect musician, went to the piano, and sang some of\r\nthose charming canzonets which are so sweet and touching, like the\r\nflowers of this country of melody. The voice of Aminta found an echo in\r\nthe heart of Maulear, and his ecstasy was at its height, when Gaetano\r\njoined her and sang the charming duo from Romeo e Julietta, the\r\n_chef-d'oeuvre_ of Zingarelli. The jealous Maulear, as he heard this\r\npassionate music, could not believe that art alone inspired the singer.\r\nHe trembled when he thought, that as Julietta loved Romeo, Aminta might\r\nadore Gaetano.\r\n\r\nUnable to repress the agitation which took possession of him, Maulear\r\nleft the saloon at the end of the duo, to superintend the preparations\r\nfor his departure. The night was dark, and pale lightning shot through\r\nthe sky, foreboding a storm. The Marquis could not repress his\r\nmortification. The voices of Aminta and the young Italian, blended\r\ntogether, followed him wherever he went \"People,\" thought he, \"only sing\r\nthus when they are linked together by love. Art alone cannot give so\r\npassionate an expression to their tones. Indeed, what sentiment can be\r\nmore natural? Educated together, always near each other, their affection\r\ncannot but have grown up with them, so that now they perceive the effect\r\nwithout being aware of the cause. They love each other because they were\r\nborn to do so, as birds mate in the spring because it is the season of\r\nlove. The spring of Gaetano and Aminta is come. How can I, a stranger to\r\nthis young girl, hope to please her? Her real preserver was not I, but\r\nthe unfortunate Tonio. Her gratitude to me then must be very feeble.\r\nBesides, does gratitude lead to love?\"\r\n\r\nAs he indulged in these painful reflections, his eyes became fixed on\r\nthe skies, already damascened with black clouds. He strode rapidly\r\nacross the court of the villa until he saw in front of him Gaetano\r\nBrignoli. Maulear could not repress a sentiment of anger at seeing him,\r\nand one of those emotions inconsiderately indulged in, and which\r\nreflection often punishes, though too late, took possession of him.\r\n\r\n\"Signor,\" said he to the young man, \"you love the Signorina Aminta\r\nRovero.\" Gaetano, surprised at the sudden rencontre in the dark, and yet\r\nmore amazed at the excited tone of the Marquis, looked at him, and in\r\nhis dark black eyes shone neither anger nor indignation, but only\r\nastonishment at the question.\r\n\r\n\"I have the honor to ask you,\" said Maulear, now become more calm,\r\nhaving more command of himself, and blushing at his first uncivil\r\nquestion, \"if you do not (and it is very natural) feel a deep and tender\r\naffection for your childhood's friend, the Signorina Aminta Rovero?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I love Aminta?\" replied Gaetano. \"Ah! Monsieur, who would not love\r\nher! Do you know a more beautiful girl in Naples? Do you know any one\r\nmore cultivated and refined than she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not,\" said the Marquis, with a voice of half-stifled emotion.\r\n\r\n\"She is my childhood's friend, the companion of my sports. With her I\r\nreceived my first lessons in music. The divine art I adore. You all know\r\nwe accord, exactly. I often sing false, my teacher tells me, but she\r\nnever does.\"\r\n\r\nTo hear one the heart loves and adores, spoken of with qualification and\r\nfamiliarity by a stranger, is often an acute pain to a lover, so acute,\r\nthat even the familiarity of a brother with a sister often causes\r\ndistress to certain minds. Some jealous souls think this a robbery of\r\nfriendship, and a profanation of their idol.\r\n\r\nMaulear, wounded that the cherished name of Aminta should be so\r\ncavalierly treated by Gaetano, replied with ill-disguised temper,\r\n\r\n\"I understand, Signor, that there is nothing false, even musically\r\nspeaking, in the sentiments expressed by you to Signora Rovero. Perhaps\r\nthis is an exception to your usual habits, as your professor says. But\r\nwere he to find fault with the correctness of your tones, he could not\r\ncensure the sincerity of the passion breathed through them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is not that true?\" said Gaetano, really flattered at Maulear's\r\ncompliment. \"It is exalted, distinct, and intense. It is of a good\r\nschool, and of the lofty style of Tacchinardi.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Signor,\" replied Maulear impatiently, \"you know as well as I do,\r\nthat no artist, however skilful and great, can express love as lovers\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fact is,\" continued Gaetano, \"that Zingarelli must have loved some\r\nJulietta, when he wrote his Romeo.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you,\" answered Maulear, \"must adore Signorina Aminta, to play so\r\nwell the part of Romeo!\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said Gaetano, smiling; \"and I know very few tenors in San\r\nCarlo who sing that _duo_ as I do. All must confess that there is no\r\nJulietta like her.\"\r\n\r\nMaulear was amazed, and could make no reply. The young man either was\r\nsincere, and had not understood him, or he had affected not to do so,\r\nassuming the remarks of his companion to refer to the singer, and not to\r\nthe lover. He positively refused to become Maulear's confidant, and by\r\nhis adroitness and tact made himself understood. The result of all this\r\nwas, that Maulear remained in a cruel state of doubt in relation to the\r\nsentiments Gaetano entertained for Aminta, and, what was yet more\r\npainful, in relation to those of Aminta for Gaetano.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, Marquis,\" said the young man to Maulear, \"our conversation\r\nis so unexpected, that I, in my surprise, forgot a commission with which\r\nI was charged by Signora Rovero. I sought you to inform you of it, when\r\nour conversation was diverted to something else. Signora Rovero,\r\nfancying that you were superintending the preparations for your\r\ndeparture, wishes you to postpone them until to-morrow, as the night is\r\ndark and the road difficult and dangerous. Look,\" said he, \"at these\r\nlarge drops of rain, which are the avant-couriers of a violent storm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" said Maulear, \"I will then accompany you to the ladies.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they returned to the room, they found Signora Rovero talking with\r\nthe Count Brignoli, and Taddeo, with his head on his hand, lost in sad\r\nmeditation. Leaning on the back of his chair, was the poetic figure of\r\nAminta. Her long black curls fell over her brother's brow, and when he\r\nlooked up to see what it was that hung over him, she leaned her face\r\ntowards his until their lips met.\r\n\r\n\"Brother,\" said she, \"I closed your eyes on purpose that I might hide\r\nwhat I see in them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you see there, my dear sister?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said she, \"by their sadness and languor, that my brother has\r\nthree pieces of a heart. Two he keeps for my mother and myself, but the\r\nthird--\"\r\n\r\n\"Is for none,\" said Taddeo, rising.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, very well, Monsieur,\" said Aminta, piqued. \"No one asks you\r\nfor your secret. We take an interest only in those we love--and I love\r\nyou no more.\"\r\n\r\n\"My good sister,\" said Taddeo, clasping her hands with emotion, \"love\r\nme, love me better than ever, for I have more need of your affection.\"\r\nAminta threw herself in his arms.\r\n\r\n\"What is all that?\" said their mother, looking around.\r\n\r\n\"A family drama,\" said Gaetano, who had just come in with Maulear.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Gaetano,\" said Signora Rovero, \"and a happy scene of that drama;\r\nfor I know of no family more fortunate than mine.\"\r\n\r\nAminta drew near to Maulear, and her manner was so kind, and she paid\r\nsuch attention to her guest, that Maulear felt his uneasiness pass away\r\nand his confidence return. Just then the storm burst in all its fury.\r\nThe wind whistled violently among the tall trees of the park. Signora\r\nRovero kept her three guests. A night passed beneath the same roof with\r\nAminta, gratified every wish of the Marquis, and promised him an\r\nopportunity on the next day to declare himself to the Rose of Sorrento,\r\nand confirm or dissipate his jealous doubts.\r\n\r\nSignora Rovero wished to discharge every duty of hospitality to her\r\nguest, and escorted him herself to the room he was to occupy. \"This\r\nroom,\" said she to Maulear, \"was long occupied by my dear daughter; but\r\nafter the death of her father we altered our arrangements, and Aminta is\r\nnow in my own room. Since that time it has been occupied by our young\r\nfriend Gaetano Brignoli. I have to-night placed him elsewhere, to be\r\nable to give you the best room.\"\r\n\r\nMaulear quivered with joy at the idea of occupying the room in which she\r\nhe adored had slept, and it was with a kind of veneration that he took\r\npossession of it. The room was on the first story, in the right wing of\r\nthe villa, and looked on a terrace covered with flowers, and\r\ncommunicating with all the rooms of the first floor. It was possible to\r\nreach, in two ways, the rooms of the first story--from the interior of\r\nthe building, and from the exterior by this elegant terrace. But Maulear\r\ndid not observe that night the situation of his room.\r\n\r\nThe early days of March having been colder than those of February, after\r\na strange season, which well-nigh had deposed winter from its throne,\r\nand the injury Aminta had received not having permitted her to leave her\r\nroom, during his previous visits the Marquis had not examined the\r\nresidence of Signora Rovero. The terrace on which his window opened was\r\ntherefore completely unknown to him.\r\n\r\nFor about two hours after Maulear had been conducted to the old room of\r\nAminta by Signora Rovero, he was so agitated by the events of the\r\nevening that he could not consent to seek repose. Love, hope, and\r\njealousy, disputed for the possession of his heart. Seated in a vast\r\narm-chair, near the hearth, the fire on which flickered faintly, the\r\neyes of Maulear were mechanically directed to one of the windows of his\r\nroom, by the beating of the rain against it. All at once he saw, or\r\nthought he saw, a white figure on the other side of the window pause for\r\na few instants, as if it sought to enter his room. Maulear fancied\r\nhimself under the influence of a dream. He rubbed his eyes, to be sure\r\nthat he was awake, and that his sight did not deceive him. He hurried\r\ntowards the window and opened it hastily. But as he moved, and his steps\r\nwere heard, the nocturnal visitor disappeared, and Maulear lost sight of\r\nit amid the shadows of night. For a moment he thought it some aerial\r\nbeing, flitting through space, and coming, like the _djinns_ of the\r\nEast, to watch by night over the faithful believer. But his poetry gave\r\nway to material evidence, and the sight of the terrace, of whose\r\nexistence he had had no suspicion, proved that the _djinn_ was really a\r\nhuman being, who for some unknown motive had wandered across it, and was\r\nby no means so unreal as he had supposed. The idea of crime and theft\r\noccurred to him. He was about to follow the person who fled, when he saw\r\non the terrace, before his window, an object which he immediately picked\r\nup, and examined by the light of his lamp. It was a veil of white lace,\r\nat that time the ordinary dress of Neapolitan women, a vaporous cloud in\r\nwhich they framed their features, the relic of a fashion imported from\r\nFrance, and made illustrious by the pencil of our Irabey, the great\r\nportrayer of the grace and beauty of the empire.\r\n\r\n\"It is beyond doubt some love-scrape,\" thought Maulear, \"interrupted by\r\nmy occupying this bedroom; and the heroine of the adventure, having come\r\nto the window to ascertain whether or not I slept, has fled, losing a\r\nportion of her drapery, like a frightened sheep running through thorns.\"\r\nWhen, however, he had examined the veil more closely, Maulear observed\r\nits elegance and richness, and began to think which of the inmates of\r\nthe villa was likely to wear such a one. Was this the headdress of a\r\nchambermaid? If not, who else but Aminta could wear it, unless indeed\r\nher mother did? Lost in conjectures, the Marquis was roused by hearing a\r\ndoor in the same corridor on which his room was, open. He listened. Two\r\npersons spoke in a low tone; and walking with such precaution that it\r\nwas evident they had no disposition to be overheard. Such an occurrence,\r\nin a house usually so silent and calm, excited Maulear's curiosity so\r\nmuch, that he resolved to know who the mysterious personages were.\r\n\r\nSilently leaving his room, he went down the long corridor through which\r\nthose he wished to follow had preceded him. A faint light from a dark\r\nlantern, borne by one of the strangers, fell on the path in front of\r\nthem, and was a guide to Maulear. Thus they descended the principal\r\nstaircase of the villa, crossed the ground floor, and entered the front\r\ncourt. A puff of wind just then put out the lantern, as the person who\r\nbore it was attempting to brighten its flame.\r\n\r\n\"Fool!\" said one of the two men to his companion. \"How can I saddle my\r\nhorse now?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is already saddled,\" said the other.\r\n\r\n\"Then I have nothing to do but mount!\"\r\n\r\n\"And you will not have occasion to use the spur,\" said the man with the\r\nlantern, \"for he is wild, from having been three weeks in his stable.\"\r\nAs the two speakers thus communed, they entered the second courtyard of\r\nthe villa. Maulear had followed them thither, hidden in the deep shadow.\r\nA horse, ready saddled, was waiting there. One of the two men sprang\r\nlightly into the saddle, and the other, as he opened a gate into the\r\nfields, through which the horseman rode, said, in a voice full of fear,\r\n\"May God protect you in this terrible midnight storm, Signor Taddeo.\r\nBeware of the road down the ravine, and be careful whom you meet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--THE AVOWAL.\r\n\r\nMaulear, uneasy and disturbed by what he had seen, returned to his room.\r\nWhat could induce Taddeo thus to leave his mother's house, alone, at\r\nmidnight, and in a storm? Could it be that, so recently liberated, he\r\nwas about to begin again that life of plot and sedition which already\r\nhad cost him his liberty? A deep interest united Maulear to Taddeo. The\r\nlove he felt toward the sister, made him devoted to the brother, and the\r\nnew dangers which might befall the young man seriously affected Maulear.\r\nThe night passed away without his being able to sleep. In addition to\r\nfear on account of Taddeo, his heart was yet agitated by the emotions of\r\nthe previous day; but above all, he thought of the woman who had stood\r\nat his window, and whose appearance he could not forget. A terrible idea\r\nthen occurred to him. The room he occupied had been that of Gaetano\r\nBrignoli. Had this young girl, apparently so pure and modest, had the\r\nWhite Rose of Sorrento, any secret amour or intrigue? The young man who\r\nhad seen the companion of her infancy might know of it. Could this\r\ncharming flower be already scorched by the hot breath of passion?\r\nMaulear reproached himself as with a crime, for the mental profanation\r\nof his divinity.\r\n\r\nThe morning meal assembled together all the family and guests. Taddeo\r\nparticipated in it as naturally as if he had passed the whole night in\r\nthe villa, and not a word was said of his nocturnal expedition. He was\r\nnot so melancholy and moody as he had been on the previous night, and a\r\ncareful observer might have marked on his features the satisfaction\r\nfollowing the performance of a painful duty. The Brignoli bade adieu to\r\nSignora Rovero immediately after breakfast, and returned to their villa.\r\nMaulear was delighted at their departure.\r\n\r\n\"Marquis,\" said Taddeo, \"permit me to treat you as a friend, and ask a\r\nfavor of you--a favor that will require you to renounce the brilliant\r\nsaloons of Naples, whose chief ornaments are the _attaches_ of the\r\nFrench embassy, to lead for a time a retired country-life with my mother\r\nand sister?\"\r\n\r\n\"If that be the favor you ask of me,\" said Maulear with joy, \"you confer\r\none on me. I accept your proposition with gratitude.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you thinking of, brother? How can you propose such an exile to\r\nthe Marquis? Our life in the country is so sad and melancholy; what can\r\nwe offer him as a compensation for the amusements he would sacrifice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where would be the merit of the service, unless its performance cost\r\nsome sacrifice?\" said Taddeo. \"In one word, this is the state of\r\naffairs. An obligation, my honor imposes on me, requires me for at least\r\na week to be absent from Sorrento. The trial of Count Monte-Leone will\r\nbegin in a few days, and I must be present at it. It is said,\" added he,\r\nwith hesitation and a significant glance at the Marquis, \"that the\r\nCount's partisans will on that occasion be active. His enemies too are\r\nnumerous, and as he is known to have come to this house, I cannot feel\r\nsatisfied unless some courageous and energetic man replaces me, and\r\ndeigns to watch over the two dear beings I am forced to leave. This,\r\nMarquis, is what I expect from you.\"\r\n\r\n\"My heart, my arm, my life, are all at the ladies' disposal. You may\r\nrely on me.\"\r\n\r\nAminta looked down, for the first consecration made by Maulear was\r\nevidently intended for her. Taddeo did not remark it, and clasped with\r\ngratitude the hand of his new friend. Signora Rovero, terrified at the\r\nidea of losing her son again, looked sadly at him.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know what is going on,\" said she with emotion, and with that\r\ninstinct which reveals to a mother the danger of a beloved son. \"I\r\nshudder, however, Taddeo, when I see you surrounded by danger. You do\r\nnot like the government, I know, for by the fall of Murat a brilliant\r\ncareer was closed before you, for your father was one of his greatest\r\nfavorites. But in your father's name I, your mother, his widow, whose\r\nhope and support you are, beseech you not to expose the life which does\r\nnot belong to you alone. Remember, my child, your sister and myself have\r\nno other support in life than yourself, and that my weak and failing\r\nexistence could not withstand your loss.\"\r\n\r\nTaddeo grew pale, for the association with which he was affiliated might\r\nexpose him to all the dangers of which his mother was apprehensive. He\r\nconcealed his agitation by caresses and iterations of love, mentally\r\nresolving to turn aside in time from his sad career, as if those who\r\ninvolve themselves in perdition can pause in the rapid descent down the\r\ndeclivity to sorrow and death, whither the sturdiest champions are\r\nhurried to be entombed in the grave they have dug for themselves.\r\n\r\n\"You will go then to Naples?\" said Signora Rovero to her son. \"God grant\r\nthat Monte-Leone recover his liberty, since he is your friend! But,\r\nTaddeo, do not trust to his adventurous mind; he is a hurricane,\r\nenveloping all in his path. Heaven grant he may not bear you away with\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nThis conversation on this subject, so painful to the mother and annoying\r\nto the son, ended here.\r\n\r\n\"Will you deign, Signorina,\" said the Marquis to Aminta, \"to accept me\r\nas a guest for a few days?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, if you are not afraid of our retreat. Besides,\" added she,\r\nwith a smile, \"_one must have suffered as much as Leonora's lover, not\r\nto be happy in the paradise of Sorrento_.\"\r\n\r\nMaulear remembered the words he had written on the wall of Tasso's\r\nhouse. But before he could express his astonishment and joy, Aminta was\r\ngone. Just then it was announced to Maulear, that his horse waited him\r\nat the gate of the park.\r\n\r\n\"We will accompany you thither (my sister and I),\" said Taddeo.\r\n\r\nSignora Rovero called Aminta to her, and added: \"The air is keen, my\r\nchild: cover your head with your lace veil. It becomes you.\"\r\n\r\nMaulear turned quickly toward Aminta with his mind full of fear and\r\nsurprise--\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid I have lost my veil. I looked for it this morning, but\r\ncould not find it.\" Aminta seemed annoyed. Her emotion was perceived at\r\nonce by Maulear, who said to himself: \"What mystery is this? why conceal\r\nit from me?\" The coincidence of a veil being found by him, and of Aminta\r\nhaving lost one, made him keenly anxious: he was terrified, confounded,\r\nand so excited, that he could scarcely speak to Taddeo and Aminta as he\r\ncrossed the park with them.\r\n\r\n\"Remember,\" said Rovero to him, \"that my mother and sister will expect\r\nyou here in a few days.\"\r\n\r\n\"In a few days,\" said Aminta, giving the Marquis her sweetest smile.\r\n\r\n\"In a few days,\" replied Maulear, as he mounted his horse, and cast on\r\nthe young girl a look of doubting love. He then galloped off, and soon\r\ndisappeared in the long road to Sorrento.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to Naples, the whole city was busy with the approaching\r\ntrial of Monte-Leone, who was so beloved by one portion of the community\r\nand so unpopular with the other. The nobility of the two Sicilies\r\ndeplored the errors of the Count, and regretted that one of the most\r\nillustrious of the great names of Naples should embrace and defend so\r\nplebeian a cause; one in their eyes so utterly without interest as that\r\nof popular rights. But it was wounded at the idea that a peer should die\r\nby the hand of the executioner. The old leaven of independence, innate\r\nin all the aristocracies of Europe; the feudal aspirations which Louis\r\nXI. and Richelieu had so completely annihilated and subdued in France,\r\nyet germinated in the minds of the nobles of Naples. They loved the king\r\nbecause he maintained their privileges, and had re-established the\r\nrights of their birth. They would have revolted had he touched them.\r\nFrom pride of birth they would have applauded the execution of a\r\nplebeian conspirator, but were prepared to cry out _en masse_ against\r\nthat of Monte-Leone, because he was one of themselves.\r\n\r\nThe people looked on the illustrious prisoner as a defender of their\r\nrights, and sympathized with him. To sharpen this sympathy, the adepts\r\nof the Italian _vente_ everywhere represented their chief as a martyr to\r\nhis love of the people, and a victim of monarchy. Most injurious charges\r\nwere everywhere circulated against Fernando IV. It was said that he had\r\ninherited the hatred of Carlos III. to the Monte-Leoni, and sought to\r\nfollow out on the son the vengeance to which the father had fallen a\r\nvictim. Nothing was omitted that could stimulate the favor of the\r\nsuperstitious and impressionable people of Naples. The same executioner,\r\nblock and axe, which had been used at the father's death, by a strange\r\nfatality, would come in play again at the murder of the son. The\r\nimprisonment of the son at the Castle _Del Uovo_, where the father had\r\ndied, gave something of plausibility to this story. But what most\r\nexcited public curiosity was the strange incident which had taken place\r\nat _Torre-del-Greco_. All were impatient for its explanation. The double\r\nand impossible presence of the Count at the house of Stenio Salvatori,\r\nand within the fifty locks of the Castle _Del Uovo_, his contest with\r\nhis enemy, the wound he was accused of having given him, his ubiquity at\r\nthe same hour in different places, produced a thousand incredible\r\nversions, a thousand bets on this wonderful fact, unrivalled in the\r\njudicial annals of Naples.\r\n\r\nThe name of Monte-Leone was so closely and intimately linked with the\r\ndestiny of the Marquis de Maulear, with his friendship to Taddeo, and\r\nhis love of Aminta, that he partook of the general interest inspired by\r\nthe Count, and as a man of honor hoped for acquittal, notwithstanding\r\nthe influence it might exert on his happiness.\r\n\r\nTo lose confidence in one we love, is the greatest agony possible. The\r\nfour days, therefore, which separated him from Aminta, were four\r\ncenturies to Maulear. Like the majority of rich young men of our times,\r\nyielding at an early age to _liaisons_, he had formed an erroneous and\r\nunjust opinion of women in general. The withered myrtles he had often\r\ngathered, the passing amours in which almost all the men of his rank,\r\nfortune and appearance indulge, had distorted his mind in relation to a\r\nsex, the least respectable portion of which alone he was acquainted\r\nwith. But the young Marquis had exalted sentiments, and his high spirit\r\nturned aside from vulgar, common pleasures. His first loves, or not to\r\nprofane that word, his first indulgences, had for their object those\r\nwomen who lead astray an ardent mind or passionate natures; those women\r\nwho, betrayed into marriage, seek elsewhere a recompense for their\r\nmisfortunes or the deceptions practised upon them, and fancy they can\r\nfind it in the inexperience and youth of young men, whom chance throws\r\nin their way. The latter proudly, and at first eagerly, accepting their\r\nconquests, soon discover, that often they are not heroes. They become\r\nthemselves the accomplices of the criminal devices, the studied\r\nfalsehoods, employed by married women to abuse those on whom they\r\ndepend. In either case they see each other insensibly change, and in\r\nspite of themselves conceive an aversion to those pleasures, even in\r\nsharing which they blush. The idol becomes a mere woman, and the hero of\r\nthese adventures fancies himself right in estimating all women by a few\r\nexceptions, and becomes an atheist in love because he has sacrificed to\r\nfalse gods.\r\n\r\nThis deplorable theory had taken possession of Maulear. His naturally\r\npure sentiments, the poetry of his heart, had been dissipated in\r\nephemeral indulgences. The Countess of Grandmesnil, the guardian of the\r\nyoung man, fearing lest a serious passion should contravene his father's\r\nviews,--encouraged him in his _liaisons_, or at least she did nothing to\r\ninduce him to abandon them. Under this sad opinion, which is\r\nunfortunately too common in our days, that female virtue is but a name,\r\nand that the most prudent only need opportunity to go astray, Maulear\r\ncame to Naples, where we must say much success in gallantry fortified\r\nhis faith in these detestable principles.\r\n\r\nHis meeting with one so pure as Aminta had wrought a complete change in\r\nhis ideas. He saw woman under a new aspect, as we dream of her at\r\ntwenty, when the young soul first awakes. He suffered intensely when\r\nsuspicion gnawed at his heart. \"What,\" said he, yet under the influence\r\nof the pernicious theories of his youth, \"not one woman worthy of\r\nrespect! Even this young girl, apparently so modest and pure, unworthy\r\nthe confidence I reposed in her.\" The recollection of the chaste and\r\nmaidenly appearance of Aminta soon put such ideas to flight, and Maulear\r\nthenceforth had but one idea, but one desire. He sought to clear up the\r\nstrange mystery of his nocturnal vision, and extricate himself from his\r\ncruel perplexity.\r\n\r\nOn the day appointed for his return to Sorrento, as the clock struck\r\nten, he stopped his horse at the garden gate where four days before he\r\nhad left Aminta. The gate was open. He entered the orange grove which\r\nlay between it and the house. A secret hope told him he would find\r\nAminta there. He was not mistaken. She sat beneath a rustic porch, which\r\nserved as a portal to the prettiest cottage imaginable. This building,\r\nconstructed of the slightest material, had windows closed with\r\ngayly-covered verandahs, and served to shelter walkers from the heat of\r\nthe summer's sun. It was Aminta's favorite retreat, and thither she came\r\nin the morning to paint her sisters, the white Bengal roses, the red\r\ncactus and the graceful clematides, which surrounded her charming\r\nretreat. There in the evening, pensive and reflective, the young girl\r\nsuffered her glance to stray over the vast horizon of the sea gilded by\r\nthe sun's expiring rays. On the day we speak of, Maulear found her\r\nreading, or rather seeming to read, for her book rested on her knee, her\r\nivory brow supported by her hand. Her eyes, lifted up to heaven, seemed\r\nto ask the realization of some gentle dream inspired doubtless by the\r\nauthor. Perhaps the nature of the dream might have been devised by the\r\nbook--Tasso's Divine Poem! Maulear glided rather than walked to her, so\r\nfearful was he of destroying the beautiful tableau presented to him by\r\nchance. Then he paused some moments behind a screen of leaves, and\r\nlooked at the beautiful dreamer, in mute but passionate adoration. As he\r\nscanned her girlish form, becoming intoxicated with her modest charms,\r\nMaulear blushed at his suspicions, and resolved to abandon them. God did\r\nnot make such angels for men to distrust, and Aminta, beautiful as the\r\nheavenly beings, must be pure and spiritual as they.\r\n\r\nHe left his concealment, and approached Aminta. She moved when she saw\r\nhim, for he had surprised her in a dream. The dreams of young girls are\r\ntreasures to be concealed from the profane in the most profound\r\nsanctuary of the heart. Aminta advanced a step or two towards Maulear,\r\nthus testifying her wish to return to the villa. But the Marquis, afraid\r\nof losing this favorable opportunity to see her for a short time alone,\r\nbegged her to be seated, and took his place beside her, making, as an\r\nexcuse, an allusion to the fatigue of riding rapidly from Naples to\r\nSorrento.\r\n\r\nAminta sat down, but with an embarrassment which Maulear could not but\r\nsee. \"You have kept your promise, Signor,\" said she, seeking to disguise\r\nher trouble by speaking first.\r\n\r\n\"How could I not keep my promise?\" said Maulear. \"It was to see you\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"We know what such devotion must cost you,\" Aminta replied, speaking\r\naloud, as if her words were not intended only for Maulear. \"Both my\r\nmother and myself are very grateful to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Signorina,\" said Maulear, with an effort, for he was afraid of wasting\r\nin commonplaces moments in which every word he uttered had a priceless\r\nvalue, \"I did not think, as I wrote on the wall of Tasso's house the\r\nsimple lines you deigned to read and remember, that I thus wrote out my\r\nhoroscope, and divined the happiness fate marked out for me at\r\nSorrento.\"\r\n\r\n\"Happiness?\" said Aminta, and she trembled as she spoke. \"You must refer\r\nto the service you have rendered me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I speak,\" said Maulear, unable to restrain himself, \"of a new and\r\nstrange feeling to me, full of pleasure and pain, of hope and fear. I\r\nspeak of a love, which will be the pride and joy of my existence, if it\r\nbe shared; which will bring despair and torment, if she who inspires it\r\nrejects it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray be silent,\" said Aminta, rising and looking with fear around her.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you have understood me,\" said Maulear, attributing to his\r\nconfession Aminta'a emotion.\r\n\r\nThe young girl was silent. Her eyes turned towards the door of the hut,\r\nas if she feared some one would open it.\r\n\r\n\"What I say here, Signorina, with nought near me but the passing cloud\r\nand flying bird, I wish to repeat to those who love you--before your\r\nmother and brother, whom I would look on as my own. It is for you to\r\ntell me whether I shall speak to them or be silent.\"\r\n\r\nJust then a faint noise was heard in the summer-house.\r\n\r\nMaulear did not perceive it, for Aminta, more and more disturbed by the\r\nmysterious noise, had suffered the Marquis to take her hand, and the\r\nlatter, interpreting this favor as his heart wished, fell on his knees\r\nbefore the young girl, who, overcome with emotion, sat down.\r\n\r\n\"Aminta,\" said he, passionately, \"since the first day I saw you, my\r\nsoul, my life, have been your own. If you but will it, your life shall\r\nbe my own--my own, to make every hour of your life one of joy and\r\npleasure--mine, in adoring you as we do the saints in heaven.\"\r\n\r\nMaulear, with his eyes fixed on Aminta's, sought an echo to the\r\noutpourings of his soul. His lips were on Aminta's hand, when, between\r\nthe young girl and himself, he saw a hideous head, made yet more horrid\r\nby the agony it expressed. Aminta suddenly withdrew, and Maulear\r\nexperienced that terror of which the bravest are sensible when they\r\ntread on a reptile.\r\n\r\n\"Scorpione!\" said the Marquis.\r\n\r\nThis name, on the lips of the Marquis at such a time, made such an\r\nimpression, that a stream of blood, mingled with white froth, burst from\r\nhis lips, and fell at Aminta's feet.\r\n\r\n\"Help, Signor!\" said she to Maulear, \"help, I pray you, for this\r\nunfortunate man! This is the first time he has gone out since that cruel\r\nday. See, he dies!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the meaning of all this?\" said Maulear to himself, as he\r\nhurried towards the villa. \"Twice my being with Aminta has exercised\r\nthe same effect on this unfortunate being. Can she love him? Can he be\r\njealous?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE GRAND JUDGE.\r\n\r\nThe trial of Count Monte-Leone, which had been so anxiously looked for,\r\nand had given rise to so many disputes about the curious story which\r\noccupied both the high and low of Naples, was about to begin.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Palma had not been able to make good his promise to the\r\nprisoner, and bring him promptly before his judges. The incident at\r\n_Torre-del-Greco_ made a new inquiry necessary, and the examinations,\r\nresearches, and inquiries of every kind it led to daily, retarded the\r\ntrial, much to the regret of the king and his minister of police, who\r\nwere aware of the extent to which the public imagination was excited,\r\nand feared its consequences. Monte-Leone began to feel grave\r\napprehensions in relation to the dangerous game he had played. On the\r\nevening of his excursion, faithful to his word, the Count had presented\r\nhimself again to the keeper of the Castle del Uovo in the costume in\r\nwhich he had left it, and the pious wicket-keeper, when he saw the false\r\nassistant jailer, who had gone out on the previous evening, return with\r\na trembling and uncertain step, read a long lecture on intemperance and\r\nthe results of drunkenness, deplorable faults, especially to be\r\nregretted in one of his profession, where, added the turnkey proudly,\r\none needs morality, reason, and vigilance especially, to unravel the\r\nplots of the prisoners confided to him, and to triumph over their\r\ndetestable _mania for liberty_.\r\n\r\nWhen Pietro on that evening, palpitating as he was with fear, saw\r\nMonte-Leone, whom he waited for at the postern of the castle, return,\r\nhis joy was so great that he was ready to clasp the Count's neck. The\r\nlatter was not much flattered by his transports.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the head-jailer, \"you are a noble and true gentleman. A\r\nscoundrel in your place would have escaped, and put his keeper in\r\ntrouble. You are of a good race, of a noble and generous blood, you have\r\npaid me well, and have been unwilling to hang the father of a family.\r\nNow,\" added he, \"do not let us talk together, or even look at each\r\nother. Our looks may be watched and interpreted.\"\r\n\r\nFrom that time Pietro became more brutal, more savage and stern than\r\never. The visit of the minister of police justly enough increased the\r\nterror of the jailer. He had from public rumor heard of the terrible\r\nepisode at _Torre-del-Greco_, though he did not precisely understand the\r\nmotives of the prisoner. He was aware that he had become an accomplice\r\nof his crime, and shuddered more and more at its probable results.\r\nWhenever, therefore, the Count sought to ask him any question, Pietro\r\nexhibited such terror, and his countenance was so complete a picture of\r\nfright, that Monte-Leone at last ceased to speak to him. No news from\r\nwithout, nothing enlightened the Count in relation to the consequences\r\nof his daring conduct, and for the first time he despaired of the\r\nresult. One morning his door opened as usual at meal time; but instead\r\nof withdrawing, the keeper approached Monte-Leone kindly, his ugly face,\r\non account of the complaisance which lit it up, seeming yet more horrid.\r\nHe said:\r\n\r\n\"Excellence, the great day approaches, and we must arrange some little\r\ndetails about which the High Court will no doubt be ill-mannerly enough\r\nto question us!\"\r\n\r\n\"You can speak then,\" replied Monte-Leone, with surprise.\r\n\r\n\"To-day is not yesterday. Then and ever since your escape, my gossip,\r\nthe Headsman, who lives up there as you know, distrusts me. I learn from\r\nhis assistant, who is a friend of mine, that the story of the cell\r\nundermined by the sea has made him fancy I wish to deprive him of his\r\nperquisites. I know that while he waters his flowers on the platform he\r\nkeeps an eye and ear open for all that passes here. Besides, he would\r\nnot be at all sorry to obtain my place for his first assistant--a\r\npromising lad who becomes his son-in-law to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Monte-Leone, \"the executioner's daughter is to be married.\"\r\n\r\n\"A love match. He wished to postpone the wedding until after _your\r\naffaire_, as he calls it, for on such cases he always has large\r\nperquisites, and would be able largely to increase the bride's portion.\r\nThe young girl, however, was in love, and was unwilling to wait for you.\r\nThe worthy father then determined to make her happy, and I have just\r\nseen all the party set out for the church of Santa-Lucia. The\r\nexecutioner, his wife, the bride, and the little executioners, all in\r\ntheir best garb. The procession was so imposing, they might have been\r\ntaken for a family of turnkeys. Lest, however, the people should disturb\r\nthe ceremony by a volley of stones, they set out early, at five o'clock.\r\nAs, therefore, we have no inquisitive neighbors, I am come to have an\r\nunderstanding with your excellency, in order that I may not be\r\ncompromised in the trial.\"\r\n\r\n\"So be it!\" said the Count, \"let us have an understanding. In the first\r\nplace, have they any suspicions?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of you to be sure, for unless I have wings and flew out of the window\r\nto _Torre-del-Greco_, no one but you can have opened the prison gate to\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true, then,\" said Pietro, \"you went to _Torre-del-Greco_ to\r\nstab Stenio Salvatori. I really would not have believed it, for it seems\r\nthat twenty thousand piasters is too large a sum for the pleasure of a\r\nponiard thrust--in the arm too! After all, though, we Neapolitans regard\r\nnothing valuable compared with revenge!\"\r\n\r\n\"It matters little to you whether it was for revenge or another purpose.\r\nAll I wish is, for you alone to know that I was away for twelve hours.\r\nAs neither you or I will mention it, I am at ease.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right in the main, your Excellency. But we have placed our\r\nheads in the balance, and I am determined yours shall not outweigh mine.\r\nThe hand of justice weighs heavily, especially on the poor. It would be\r\nvery bad if now, when I am prepared to live happily and pleasantly on\r\nthe proceeds of our little operation, I were called on to dangle at the\r\nend of a rope, to the great delight of the dealers in ice-water and\r\nmacaroni, whom the people of Naples on that day would enrich. Few would\r\nmiss the entertainment which would be given at my expense.\"\r\n\r\n\"What makes you fear this?\" asked the Count.\r\n\r\n\"One idea. They might take it into their heads to examine separately all\r\nthe inhabitants of the castle. First your Excellency, as its principal\r\nguest, then your humble servant, the gate-keeper, and even my assistant\r\nCrespo. If all did not tell the same story the Grand Judge would see\r\nsome trick.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think so?\" said the Count, moodily.\r\n\r\n\"I know so,\" said Pietro. \"The Grand Judge, as the child's story-book\r\nsays of ogres, loves fresh meat, and would see a spot on the brow of an\r\nangel. Now, I am not exactly an angel--and if he saw a spot, your\r\nexcellency's head might be safe, but for want of a chicken he might\r\ntwist my neck. The jailer would be the victim, and my friend the\r\nexecutioner would have to do with me. I know him. He would be\r\nenthusiastic in the operation, to make a vacancy in my place. He is\r\nbound up in his family.\"\r\n\r\nFor an instant the Count had not heard the jailer. One single name\r\ninspired him with the greatest terror, for it recalled one of the\r\nparticipators in his escape. This man held in his own hands his own and\r\nhis accomplice's escape. Pietro had not foreseen all. This assistant,\r\nthe character and dress of whom he had assumed, this Crespo, this mole,\r\nwould be summoned before the magistrate. The keeper had seen and spoken\r\nto him, had opened the gate of the castle to suffer him to pass out, or\r\nat least fancied he had. What then would the man say? With great\r\nemotion, then, Monte-Leone said,\r\n\r\n\"The danger does not come from the place you apprehend. One witness,\r\nhowever, may ruin all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of whom do you speak?\" said Pietro, trembling.\r\n\r\n\"Of Crespo,\" said the Count.\r\n\r\n\"Ah--what have you to fear of Crespo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you gained him over?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I was spared the trouble. At this moment the poor fellow is\r\nprobably in the other world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you killed him?\" said the Count, with terror.\r\n\r\n\"For what does your excellency take me? One may yield to the prayers of\r\na prisoner, and secure a fortune by permitting him a few hours'\r\nexercise, yet be no murderer. If Crespo dies, it is in consequence of\r\nhis unfortunate passion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was he in love?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. He was fond of water-rats.\"\r\n\r\n\"Horrible appetite.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" said the jailer. \"Crespo says the animal is very savory,\r\nespecially when fat as those in the ditches of the castle are. The\r\nwaters bear hither all the offal of Naples, and the rats live like\r\ncanons.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Crespo eats them?\"\r\n\r\n\"He has a passion for game of that kind, and does nothing but hunt them.\r\nHe makes some very ingenious traps to catch them with. I do not molest\r\nhim, because the taste is so innocent, and besides, saves me the expense\r\nof several cats.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how came that passion to endanger Crespo's life?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah--one is not always lucky. Perhaps the last rats Crespo ate, had\r\nfeasted on arsenic--rats are so whimsical. The poor devil, perhaps, was\r\npoisoned in that manner. Rather an expensive taste. Unfortunately, the\r\nlesson will do him no good.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this touching funeral oration, the jailer took out a blue and torn\r\nhandkerchief, and dried his eyes. The Count shuddered at this story. He\r\nunderstood the atrocious plan adopted by Pietro to get rid of a\r\ndangerous witness, and forgetful of his own safety, said,\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps, if you hurry for a physician, the poor man may yet be saved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! do you think the Governor would let one of his officers die\r\nwithout assistance? The doctor, however, was too late; and when I came\r\nhither, Crespo was dying.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his firmness, the horror of Monte-Leone at the wretch\r\nwas so great that he hastened to terminate the conversation. The quasi\r\ncomplicity in a crime committed in cold blood, and with premeditation;\r\nwas odious to him.\r\n\r\n\"Do not fear lest my examination should compromise you. I will be\r\nprudent. Now, one word more, or if you please to consider it so, one\r\nfavor more--when will I be tried?\"\r\n\r\n\"In two days. To-night they will come to take you to _Castello Capuano_,\r\nwhere the supreme court will meet.\"\r\n\r\nPietro left, and Monte-Leone relapsed into a profound reverie. The drama\r\nwas about to begin. What the Count hitherto had done, was as it were but\r\na prelude, an exposition, or rather a skilful introduction. On the eve\r\nof the event he did not quail, but like a sagacious tactician asked\r\nhimself if he had been guilty of no neglect, if he had taken advantage\r\nof all the circumstances. One thing alone made him uneasy. When he\r\nreturned to the Etruscan villa, to assume the clothes of the\r\nassistant-jailer, he saw with terror that he had lost the great emerald,\r\nthe _chef-d'oeuvre_ of Benvenuto, the family ring, so long celebrated\r\nand so well known. He readily enough fancied that it had been lost\r\nduring his rapid flight, and did not suspect that it had fallen into the\r\nhands of his enemies. Reassured on this point, he waited patiently for\r\nthe hour when, as the jailer said, they would come to take him to\r\n_Castello Capuano_. It came at last, and Monte-Leone was glad of it, for\r\nit seemed to bring him nearer to liberty. It was about midnight when the\r\nGovernor came to the Count's cell, accompanied by the worthy jailer and\r\nseveral officers.\r\n\r\n\"Excellency,\" said he to Monte-Leone, \"I have an order from the Duke of\r\nPalma, minister of police, to take you to _Castello Capuano_, to be\r\ntried.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am ready to obey the orders of the Duke,\" said Monte-Leone, \"late as\r\nthe hour and bad as the weather are. But, Signor, the Duke treats me\r\nlike those curious monsters, who travel by night to avoid the anxious\r\neyes of the public, and to enhance the profits received from their\r\nexhibition.\"\r\n\r\n\"Signor, the Duke of Palma,\" said the Governor, piqued by this irony in\r\nrelation to his patron, \"has a more exalted object than exciting or\r\nallaying the curiosity of the people of Naples. He wishes to prevent any\r\ndemonstration of your numerous partisans in your favor. Such conduct\r\nwould certainly injure your cause.\"\r\n\r\nThe sarcasm of the Count had made the Governor say too much. He had\r\nrevealed to Monte-Leone the interest he had excited, and the efforts\r\nwhich might be made to save him. To a man like Monte-Leone nothing was\r\nlost, and like a skilful geometer, he knew how to take advantage of the\r\nerrors of his adversary.\r\n\r\n\"Let us go, Signor,\" said Monte-Leone to the Governor. \"I am impatient\r\nto make an acquaintance with the new castle which the king honors me\r\nwith. Let me change once or twice again, and I will be able to publish a\r\nstatistical account of all the dungeons in the kingdom, for the\r\ninformation of his majesty's beloved subjects.\"\r\n\r\nAn hour after this scene the Count was in a room of _Castello Capuano_,\r\nappropriated to the reception of great and distinguished criminals to be\r\ntried by the high court.\r\n\r\nOn the next day, a man of cold and ascetic air waited on Monte-Leone.\r\nThis person was Felippo San Angelo, the ogre of whom Pietro had spoken,\r\nthe terror of all criminals, the Grand Judge of Naples. If the _morale_\r\nof the Judge had been calumniated by Pietro, his physique bore a strong\r\nanalogy to that of certain beasts of prey to which carnivorous appetite\r\nis attributed. His nose was hooked like an eagle's, his brow was\r\nprominent, oblong and bald, his lips were thin and fixed as if he had\r\nnever smiled, his body was long and attenuated, and he never met the\r\nglance of those with whom he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Signor,\" said the Grand Judge, \"I am come to announce to you, as the\r\nlaw requires, that you will appear before the court on the day after\r\nto-morrow. You will be allowed to choose an advocate, and, as Grand\r\nJudge of the Kingdom, I come to invite you to do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am deeply sensible of your Excellency's consideration,\" said\r\nMonte-Leone, \"but I must say, the first act of your _justice_ is\r\n_unjust_. If my enemies have had two months to prepare their accusation,\r\nit is cruel to allow me but two days to prepare my defence.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is the provision of the laws which regulate at Naples the special\r\ncourts, like the one which is to try you, Signor Comte. I do not make\r\nthe law, but only administer it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Excellency, a man of your character should not administer an\r\nunjust law; nothing should compel him to do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Signor,\" said the Grand Judge, much annoyed at finding himself\r\nunexpectedly drawn into such a discussion, \"the legislator gives us the\r\ntext of law, we find the interpretation. Your judges, the chief of whom\r\nI am, have carefully studied them, and if we have assumed on our honor\r\nand conscience their application, it is because we think them just. We\r\ndo not permit the accused to contest their forms. When a man is\r\nunfortunately brought before a court, he must submit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do, Excellency,\" said Monte-Leone, \"I will even court their severity,\r\nand will not take advantage of the very short time allowed me to choose\r\na defender. For humanity's sake alone I address you as I do. It seems to\r\nme, however, that it is necessary that I should know, in the first\r\nplace, of what I am accused; and I wait until it please your Excellency\r\nto tell me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are charged, Signor, with two capital crimes. First, of having, on\r\nthe night of the 20th December, 1815, conspired against the security of\r\nthe state, near the ruins of Pompeii, where you presided over a secret\r\nsociety, the object of which is the overthrow of royalty. You are, in\r\nthe second place, accused of having attempted to assassinate Stenio\r\nSalvatori, of _Torre-del-Greco_, to avenge yourself on account of his\r\ntestimony.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this all?\" asked Monte-Leone.\r\n\r\n\"It is, Signor,\" said the Grand Judge; \"I think such charges are\r\nimportant enough to induce you to remember that you must now choose your\r\ncounsel.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Signor,\" said Monte-Leone. \"For such a cause a skilful\r\nadvocate is required, one who shall be able to impress your heart with\r\nthe conviction of my innocence, for on his word depends my life or\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\n\"Find such a one, then, Signor,\" said the Grand Judge. \"Believe me,\r\nhowever, the most eloquent advocate has less influence over a\r\nconscientious judge than the facts of the case, the light which\r\nillumines them, and which it is their duty to make brilliant in our\r\neyes, rather than seek an opportunity to display their fluency and their\r\npolitical opinions, or, worse yet, to produce public or private\r\nscandal--\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Signor, but the person who will speak in my behalf is\r\nneither eloquent nor skilful, yet the most famous pleas, the most\r\npowerful defences of Naples, will not produce so much effect as the\r\nwords of that man.\"\r\n\r\n\"You, Signor, alone,\" said the Grand Judge, \"can choose your defender.\r\nBut let me know his name--\"\r\n\r\n\"That can only be revealed at the trial.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you do not know, Signor, you thus deprive yourself of a precious\r\nright to all who are accused, secured them by law, the right of\r\ncommunicating with their defenders.\"\r\n\r\n\"That right I waive. The man who will defend me will know his grave\r\nmission only when called on in the face of the supreme tribunal to\r\nfulfil it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Grand Judge looked with amazement at Monte-Leone. \"Why, Signor,\r\ncannot he be informed of his grave duty?\"\r\n\r\n\"God forbid he should!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because in that case I would lose my cause.\" The Count laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Act then, Signor, as you please. Strange and whimsical as your conduct\r\nis, I have no authority to speak of its advantages and disadvantages.\"\r\n\r\nHe bowed to Monte-Leone and withdrew.\r\n\r\n\"He is mad,\" said he, as he was leaving _Castello Capuano_.\r\n\r\n\"He is a fool,\" said Monte-Leone, as the Grand Judge left. \"He did not\r\nunderstand that one defends himself from the effects of a crime\r\ncommitted, but not when no crime has been committed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--THE TRIAL.\r\n\r\nThe appointed day came at last, and all Naples assumed a strange and\r\nunusual air. One subject of interest took possession of all the city,\r\none idea occupied it, and from the Senator to the Lazzarone all had one\r\nname on their lips. Monte-Leone, Count Monte-Leone.\r\n\r\n\"Monte-Leone, the people's friend,\" said some.\r\n\r\n\"Monte-Leone, the conspirator,\" said others.\r\n\r\n\"Monte-Leone, the assassin of Stenio Salvatori,\" said the enemies of the\r\nCount.\r\n\r\n\"Monte-Leone, the victim of Fernando,\" said the enemies of the King.\r\n\r\nAs all this was going on around the prison, calm and thoughtful\r\nMonte-Leone waited for the hour of trial.\r\n\r\n_Castello Capuano_, usually called la Vicaria, had been for several\r\ncenturies the palace of the Kings and Viceroys, until Pedro de Toledo\r\nabandoned for a more splendid palace, that of the existing Kings, and\r\ndevoted la Vicaria or _Castello Capuano_ to the civil and criminal\r\ncourts of the realm. Nothing can be more sad and melancholy than the\r\nportion of the palace in which the prisons are. As if to enhance this\r\nappearance, the outside of the prison was hung with iron cages, in which\r\nwere the heads and hands of persons who had been executed. These relics\r\nof humanity, long before dried up, and the skeletons of which alone\r\nremained, rattled in the night wind horribly, and filled with\r\nsuperstitious terror the minds of belated travellers returning through\r\nthe _Porta Capuano_, from which the Castle took its name, to Naples.\r\n\r\nLa Vicaria was then from an early hour in the morning besieged by a\r\nnumerous crowd, awaiting the opening of its gates to rush into the hall\r\nof audience. The doors were opened. The hall was instantly occupied by a\r\ncrowd of curious persons, who everywhere in Europe are attracted by\r\ncriminal trials. It is a matter of surprise that in France women, and\r\nespecially those of rank, are attracted in numbers sufficient sometimes\r\nto form a majority of the audience. But the reason is, that women are\r\nnervous and impressionable, and that they constantly require excitement.\r\nThey are not often careful in the selection of these emotions, provided\r\nthere are violent shocks, revulsions of feeling, terror, hope, surprise.\r\nSuch are the fruits of criminal trials. The head of the prisoner becomes\r\na shuttlecock between the advocate and magistrate. The varied chances of\r\nsuch a scene offer great and real interest, effacing all the fictions of\r\ntragedy. There, far more than on the stage, women take delight in the\r\ndark dramas, and are the first to resent the terrible effect of the\r\ndenouements.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful women of Naples did not fail to add to the interest of the\r\nrepresentation of this drama, the hero of which possessed the admiration\r\nof all and the good graces of many. Some of the upper seats were\r\noccupied by women of high rank, who did not dare to show themselves\r\npublicly at this strange spectacle, and came, like beggars, to enjoy a\r\nscene which they would be ashamed to have acknowledged. Places, too, had\r\nbeen reserved for the patrician women, near the bench of the judges and\r\nadvocates. These cold, careless creatures, attracted by mere curiosity,\r\nwere not the most numerous of the agitated crowd. The private friends of\r\nthe Count, his partisans, the members of the society of which he was the\r\nchief, formed an imposing mass agitated by the most tumultuous\r\nsentiments. Two hearts beat violently, and, though in different places,\r\na skilful clock-maker would have declared that one was not faster than\r\nthe other by a single second. These two hearts were full of the same\r\nobject, desired the same thing, pursued the same end. One sentiment\r\nunited both, and they were equally tortured by hope and fear.\r\n\r\nOne of these was a woman dressed in black, and having a half disclosed,\r\nfresh and beautiful face. A fine and delicately gloved hand was placed\r\nupon her heart as if to restrain its pulsations. Her other hand, from\r\ntime to time, was passed beneath her veil, to bear to her lips an\r\nexquisitely embroidered and perfumed handkerchief. She sat alone on one\r\nof the remote benches. For a long time she remained motionless, but\r\nsuddenly seeming anxious to avoid observation, she approached, as\r\nnearly as possible, the front of the recess in which the bench on which\r\nshe had been sitting was placed. She then cast a quick, anxious glance\r\non the crowd which filled every portion of the court-room, returned, and\r\nbecame again motionless, and apparently calm as she had been before.\r\n\r\nThe other actor in this silent scene, was a young man with a pale and\r\nagitated countenance, which betrayed the anxiety of his mind, and the\r\ndeep interest he took in the events of the day. Yet not to the place\r\nreserved for the judges, nor the doors through which the prisoner would\r\nbe led, did he look. Suspiciously examining every bench in the hall,\r\nperceiving (so to speak) the mass of spectators, the long lines of which\r\nrose one above another, he examined the most remote, even, without\r\nperceiving what he was evidently so anxious to find. At last, by a\r\nsudden start, he attracted the attention of those near him,--a\r\nhalf-stifled cry burst from his lips; he had perceived the lonely woman\r\non the remote bench.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know that lady?\" said a young man who sat upon the advocates'\r\nbench.\r\n\r\n\"I know her?\" said he, \"not at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, you seemed surprised when you saw her.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fact was, I had not remarked those seats; they are real opera\r\nboxes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look again, Signor, the lady amuses herself strangely.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see nothing, sir,\" said the pale young man, who still kept his eyes\r\nfixed upon the lady.\r\n\r\n\"Three times,\" said the first speaker, \"she has placed her hand upon her\r\nhair, as if she would point out to somebody a diamond pin which shines\r\namid her jetty locks like a star in a stormy sky.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure of it, it is a signal--and see, she has taken her pin from\r\nher hair, and is imploring. Ah! sir, what a pretty Venus hand. One kiss\r\non her hand, and I would die content!\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure,\" said the other mechanically, and without knowing what he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"It is some intrigue,\" said the gossiper, \"the women of our country go\r\neverywhere, to the church, to the court, and to the theatre. It would be\r\nodd if it were the judge's wife. They who always condemn others,\r\nsometimes must atone for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak lower, Signor, speak lower; you may compromise her.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, true, but by St. Januarius, see what she is about now;\" he spoke\r\nlower.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" said the young man.\r\n\r\n\"She has placed her finger upon her pin, and looks this way, as if she\r\nwas interrogating you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mistaken; besides, how can you see under a veil which way she\r\nlooks?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no doubt about it, it is intended for us, and she wishes to\r\nspeak either to you or to me.\"\r\n\r\nLooking towards the person of whom they spoke, for the purpose of giving\r\nmore force to his asseveration, he was amazed to see her white hand\r\nholding the diamond pin to her lips. The scene we have been so long\r\ndescribing had taken place in a few seconds. Prompt as was the reply of\r\nthe young man to the interrogatory of the woman, his companion had\r\nperceived it. The latter being a man of good taste, and perfectly expert\r\nin the telegraphs of love, was persuaded that he had interfered in some\r\nlove affair, and hastened to say to the hero of the adventure,\r\n\r\n\"Do not be afraid, sir, I have seen nothing. Well-bred people, such as\r\nyou and I are, never speak of secrets we thus become acquainted\r\nwith--and I am ready to maintain with my lip and with my sword, that you\r\nhave not the slightest acquaintance with the lady there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said the young man; \"your conduct proves you to be a\r\ngentleman.\"\r\n\r\nJust then all the assemblage became full of eager expectation at the\r\nentrance of the High Court, preceded by the President.\r\n\r\n\"The court is opened--produce the prisoner,\" said the Grand Judge.\r\n\r\nThe agitation became stronger. Women stood up in their chairs, men\r\nclimbed up on the banisters, and others, vexed at not being able to see,\r\nprotested against the appropriation of seats by the legs and boots of\r\nthose in front of them. The disorder was quickly put an end to by the\r\nimperious voice of the Grand Judge, who threatened to have the hall\r\ncleared if order were not at once restored, and the respect due to the\r\ncourt maintained. All became immediately quiet; the audience sat down,\r\nthose in the rear ceased to complain, and many an eye was fixed on Count\r\nMonte-Leone.\r\n\r\nThe Count sat in the lofty seat reserved for him, an arm-chair replaced\r\nthe stool used by vulgar criminals. The respect due to rank and birth\r\nwas religiously observed in this aristocratic tribunal. The noble, if\r\nfound guilty, was certainly sentenced to death, as the merest\r\ncommoner--the form of trial, though, always exhibited respect for\r\nillustrious names, which was most gratifying to the people. The fact\r\nwas, at that time people believed in social superiority, had faith in\r\ntheir God, king and nobles, and though they demanded that their nobles\r\nshould be punished, did not expect them to die like common people; the\r\ndifference was the difference between the rope and the sabre. That very\r\ndifference, however, between the two deaths--the terrible theatrical\r\neffect of the latter, made a great impression on the masses.\r\n\r\nThe public accuser arose, and pronounced an eloquent harangue against\r\nMonte-Leone, as guilty of two crimes, the nature of which the Grand\r\nJudge had already described to him in prison.\r\n\r\nFirst crime: Conspiracy against the State, in having presided at the\r\nsecret _venta_ of Pompeia, as chief of a society, having for its object\r\nthe overturning of the monarchy.\r\n\r\nTO BE CONTINUED.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[25] Entered

dew distils,\r\n    Pushes back her heavy tresses,\r\n      Listening toward the northern hills.\r\n    \"I am happy, very happy,\r\n      None so much as I am blest;\r\n    None of all the many maidens\r\n      In the Valley of the West,\"\r\n    Softly to herself she whispered;\r\n      Paused she then again to hear\r\n    If the step of Allen Archer,\r\n      That she waited for, were near.\r\n    \"Ah, he knows I love him fondly!--\r\n      I have never told him so!--\r\n    Heart of mine be not so heavy,\r\n      He will come to-night, I know.\"\r\n\r\n    Brightly is the full moon filling\r\n      All the withered woods with light,\r\n    \"He has not forgotten surely--\r\n      It was later yesternight!\"\r\n    Shadows interlock with shadows--\r\n      Says the maiden, \"Woe is me!\"\r\n    In the blue the eve-star trembles\r\n      Like a lily in the sea.\r\n    Yet a good hour later sounded,--\r\n      But the northern woodlands sway!--\r\n    Quick a white hand from her casement\r\n      Thrust the heavy vines away.\r\n    Like the wings of restless swallows\r\n      That a moment brush the dew,\r\n    And again are up and upward,\r\n      Till we lose them in the blue,\r\n    Were the thoughts of Jessie Carol,--\r\n      For a moment dim with pain,\r\n    Then with pleasant waves of sunshine,\r\n      On the hills of hope again.\r\n    \"Selfish am I, weak and selfish,\"\r\n      Said she, \"thus to sit and sigh;\r\n    Other friends and other pleasures\r\n      Claim his leisure well as I.\r\n    Haply, care or bitter sorrow\r\n      'Tis that keeps him from my side,\r\n    Else he surely would have hasted\r\n      Hither at the twilight tide.\r\n    Yet, sometimes I can but marvel\r\n      That his lips have never said,\r\n    When we talked about the future,\r\n      Then, or then, we shall be wed!\r\n    Much I fear me that my nature\r\n      Cannot measure half his pride,\r\n    And perchance he would not wed me\r\n      Though I pined of love and died.\r\n    To the aims of his ambition\r\n      I would bring nor wealth nor fame.\r\n    Well, there is a quiet valley\r\n      Where we both shall sleep the same!\"\r\n    So, more eves than I can number,\r\n      Now despairing, and now blest,\r\n    Watched the gentle Jessie Carol\r\n      From the Valley of the West.\r\n\r\n\r\n              II.\r\n\r\n    Down along the dismal woodland\r\n      Blew October's yellow leaves,\r\n    And the day had waned and faded,\r\n      To the saddest of all eves.\r\n    Poison rods of scarlet berries\r\n      Still were standing here and there,\r\n    But the clover blooms were faded,\r\n      And the orchard boughs were bare.\r\n    From the stubble fields the cattle\r\n      Winding homeward, playful, slow,\r\n    With their slender horns of silver\r\n      Pushed each other to and fro.\r\n    Suddenly the hound upspringing\r\n      From his sheltering kennel, whined,\r\n    As the voice of Jessie Carol\r\n      Backward drifted on the wind,\r\n    Backward drifted from a pathway\r\n      Sloping down the upland wild,\r\n    Where she walked with Allan Archer,\r\n      Light of spirit as a child!\r\n    All her young heart wild with rapture\r\n      And the bliss that made it beat--\r\n    Not the golden wells of Hybla\r\n      Held a treasure half so sweet!\r\n    But as oft the shifting rose-cloud,\r\n      In the sunset light that lies,\r\n    Mournful makes us, feeling only\r\n      How much farther are the skies,--\r\n    So the mantling of her blushes,\r\n      And the trembling of her heart,\r\n    'Neath his steadfast eyes but made her\r\n      Feel how far they were apart.\r\n\r\n    \"Allan,\" said she, \"I will tell you\r\n      Of a vision that I had--\r\n    All the livelong night I dreamed it,\r\n      And it made me very sad.\r\n    We were walking slowly, seaward,\r\n      In the twilight--you and I--\r\n    Through a break of clearest azure\r\n      Shone the moon--as now--on high;\r\n    Though I nothing said to vex you,\r\n      O'er your forehead came a frown,\r\n    And I strove, but could not soothe you--\r\n      Something kept my full heart down;\r\n    When, before us, stood a lady\r\n      In the moonlight's pearly beam,\r\n    Very tall and proud and stately--\r\n      (Allan, this was in my dream!--)\r\n    Looking down, I thought, upon me,\r\n      Half in pity, half in scorn,\r\n    Till my soul grew sick with wishing\r\n      That I never had been born.\r\n    'Cover me from woe and madness!'\r\n      Cried I to the ocean flood,\r\n    As she locked her milk-white fingers\r\n      In between us where we stood,--\r\n    All her flood of midnight tresses\r\n      Softly gathered from their flow,\r\n    By her crown of bridal beauty,\r\n      Paler than the winter snow.\r\n    Striking then my hands together,\r\n      O'er the tumult of my breast,--\r\n    All the beauty waned and faded\r\n      From the Valley of the West!\"\r\n\r\n    In the beard of Allan Archer\r\n      Twisted then his fingers white,\r\n    As he said, \"My gentle Jessie,\r\n      You must not be sad to-night;\r\n    You must not be sad, my Jessie--\r\n      You are over kind and good,\r\n    And I fain would make you happy,\r\n      Very happy--if I could!\"\r\n    Oft he kissed her cheek and forehead,\r\n      Called her darling oft, but said,\r\n    Never, that he loved her fondly,\r\n      Or that ever they should wed;\r\n    But that he was grieved that shadows\r\n      Should have chilled so dear a heart;\r\n    That the time foretold so often\r\n      Then was come--and they must part!\r\n    Shook her bosom then with passion,\r\n      Hot her forehead burned with pain,\r\n    But her lips said only, \"Allan,\r\n      Will you ever come again?\"\r\n    And he answered, lightly dallying\r\n      With her tresses all the while,\r\n    Life had not a star to guide him\r\n      Like the beauty of her smile;\r\n    And that when the corn was ripened\r\n      And the vintage harvest prest,\r\n    She would see him home returning\r\n      To the Valley of the West.\r\n\r\n    When the moon had veiled her splendor,\r\n      And went lessening down the blue,\r\n    And along the eastern hill-tops\r\n      Burned the morning in the dew,\r\n    They had parted--each one feeling\r\n      That their lives had separate ends;\r\n    They had parted--neither happy--\r\n      Less than lovers--more than friends.\r\n    For as Jessie mused in silence,\r\n      She remembered that he said,\r\n    Never, that he loved her fondly,\r\n      Or that ever they should wed.\r\n\r\n    'Twas full many a nameless meaning\r\n      My poor words can never say,\r\n    Felt without the need of utterance,\r\n      That had won her heart away.\r\n\r\n    O the days were weary! weary!\r\n      And the eves were dull and long,\r\n    With the cricket's chirp of sorrow,\r\n      And the owlet's mournful song.\r\n    But in slumber oft she started\r\n      In the still and lonesome nights,\r\n    Hearing but the traveller's footstep\r\n      Hurrying toward the village lights.\r\n\r\n    So, moaned by the dreary winter--\r\n      All her household tasks fulfilled--\r\n    Till beneath the last year's rafters\r\n      Came the swallows back to build.\r\n    Meadow-pinks, like flakes of crimson,\r\n      Over all the valleys lay,\r\n    And again were oxen ploughing\r\n      Up and down the hills all day.\r\n    Thus the dim days dawned and faded\r\n      To the maid, forsaken, lorn,\r\n    Till the freshening breeze of summer\r\n      Shook the tassels of the corn.\r\n    Ever now within her chamber\r\n      All night long the lamp-light shines,\r\n    But no white hand from her casement\r\n      Pushes back the heavy vines.\r\n    On her cheek a fire was feeding,\r\n      And her hand transparent grew--\r\n    Ah, the faithless Allan Archer!\r\n      More than she had dreamed was true.\r\n\r\n    No complaint was ever uttered,\r\n      Only to herself she sighed,--\r\n    As she read of wretched poets\r\n      Who had pined of love and died.\r\n    Once she crushed the sudden crying\r\n      From her trembling lips away,\r\n    When they said the vintage harvest\r\n      Had been gathered in that day\r\n    Often, when they kissed her, smiled she,\r\n      Saying that it soothed her pain,\r\n    And that they must not be saddened--\r\n      She would soon be well again!\r\n    Thus nor hoping nor yet fearing,\r\n      Meekly bore she all her pain.\r\n    Till the red leaves of the autumn\r\n      Withered from the woods again;\r\n    Till the bird had hushed its singing\r\n      In the silvery sycamore,\r\n    And the nest was left unsheltered\r\n      In the lilac by the door;\r\n    Saying, still, that she was happy--\r\n      None so much as she was blest--\r\n    None, of all the many maidens\r\n      In the Valley of the West.\r\n\r\n\r\n              III.\r\n\r\n    Down the heath and o'er the moorland\r\n      Blows the wild gust high and higher,\r\n    Suddenly the maiden pauses\r\n      Spinning at the cabin fire,\r\n    And quick from her taper fingers\r\n      Falls away the flaxen thread,\r\n    As some neighbor entering, whispers,\r\n      \"Jessie Carol lieth dead.\"\r\n    Then, as pressing close her forehead\r\n      To the window-pane, she sees\r\n    Two stout men together digging\r\n      Underneath the church-yard trees.\r\n    And she asks in kindest accents,\r\n      \"Was she happy when she died?\"--\r\n    Sobbing all the while to see them\r\n      Void the heavy earth aside;\r\n    Or, upon their mattocks leaning,\r\n      Through their fingers numb to blow,\r\n    For the wintry air is chilly,\r\n      And the grave-mounds white with snow;\r\n    And the neighbor answers softly,\r\n      \"Do not, dear one, do not cry:\r\n    At the break of day she asked us\r\n      If we thought that she must die;\r\n    And when I had told her, sadly,\r\n      That I feared it would be so,\r\n    Smiled she, saying, ''Twill be weary\r\n      Digging in the churchyard snow!'\r\n    'Earth,' I said, 'was very dreary--\r\n      That its paths at best were rough;\r\n    And she whispered, she was ready,\r\n      That her life was long enough.\r\n    So she lay serene and silent,\r\n      Till the wind, that wildly drove,\r\n    Soothed her from her mortal sorrow,\r\n      Like the lullaby of love.\"\r\n    Thus they talked, while one that loved her\r\n      Smoothed her tresses dark and long,\r\n    Wrapped her white shroud down, and simply\r\n      Wove her sorrow to this song:\r\n\r\n\r\n              IV.\r\n\r\n    Sweetly sleeps she: pain and passion\r\n      Burn no longer on her brow--\r\n    Weary watchers, ye may leave her--\r\n      She will never need you now!\r\n    While the wild spring bloomed and faded,\r\n      Till the autumn came and passed,\r\n    Calmly, patiently, she waited--\r\n      Rest has come to her at last!\r\n    Never have the blessed angels,\r\n      As they walked with her apart,\r\n    Kept pale Sorrow's battling armies\r\n      Half so softly from her heart\r\n    Therefore, think not, ye that loved her,\r\n      Of the pallor hushed and dread,\r\n    Where the winds, like heavy mourners,\r\n      Cry about her lonesome bed,\r\n    But of white hands softly reaching\r\n      As the shadow o'er her fell,\r\n    Downward from the golden bastion\r\n      Of the eternal citadel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Memorial,\" just published by Putnam.]\r\n\r\nA STORY OF CALAIS.\r\n\r\nBY THE AUTHOR OF \"ST. LEGER.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSome years ago, I was detained unexpectedly in Calais for an entire\r\nweek. It was with difficulty I could occupy the time. For a while my\r\nchief resource was to inspect the different faces which daily presented\r\nthemselves at the Hotel de Meurice, where one could see every variety of\r\nfeatures belonging to every country, age, sex, and condition. I grew\r\ntired of this presently, for I had been on the continent a considerable\r\nperiod, and had seen the human species under as many different phases as\r\ncould well be imagined. Therefore, when the third day brought with it\r\none of those disagreeable storms peculiar to the coast--half drizzle,\r\nhalf sleet and rain--it found me weary of the amusement of attending on\r\nnew arrivals and departures, and of the nameless petty doings by which\r\ntime, in a bustling hotel, is attempted to be frittered away. A misty,\r\ndreary, damp, offensive day! An out-and-out tempest, a thorough\r\nright-down drenching rain, would have been in agreeable contrast with\r\nthe previous hot, dusty, sunny weather; but this--it seemed absolutely\r\nintolerable! I was, besides, in no particular condition to be pleased. I\r\nwas neither setting out upon a tour, nor returning from one, but had\r\nbeen interrupted in my progress and forced to stand still at this most\r\nuninteresting spot. I came down, and with a bad grace, to order\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\n\"Garcon, Cafe--oeufs a la coque--biftek--rotie--vite!\"\r\n\r\nI was about repeating this in a louder tone, for the waiter seemed\r\nengrossed with something more important than attending to my wants, when\r\nI heard a quiet voice behind me--\r\n\r\n\"Garcon, Cafe--oeufs a la coque--biftek--rotie--vite!\"\r\n\r\nI turned angrily upon the speaker, doubtful of the design of this\r\nrepetition of my order.\r\n\r\nThe reader will perceive that my breakfast was a substantial one;\r\nindeed, such a breakfast as an American, who had not so far lost himself\r\nin \"European society\" as to forget his appetite, would be very likely to\r\ncall for. The idea that I was watched, doubtless made me a little\r\nsuspicious, or sensitive, or irritable; at any rate, I turned, as I have\r\nsaid, angrily upon the speaker. He was a slightly made, elderly man, at\r\nleast fifty, with pleasant features, a calm appearance, and quiet\r\nmanners--a person evidently at home with the world. I recollected at the\r\nsame moment, that the stranger had been at the hotel ever since my\r\narrival there, although I had not, from his unobtrusive habit, given him\r\nmore than a passing notice. His appearance at once dispelled the frown\r\nwhich I had brought to bear upon him; but when he answered my stare with\r\na respectful yet half familiar bow, I could have sworn that it came\r\nfrom an old acquaintance. I need not say that I returned the salutation\r\ncordially. At the same time my new friend rose, came towards me, and\r\nheld out his hand.\r\n\r\n\"I am quite sure,\" he said, \"that you are an American--perhaps a New\r\nEnglander; _I_ am both; why, then, should not countrymen beguile an\r\nunpleasant day in company? Excuse me--I did hear your order just now,\r\nand as it suited my own taste, I proposed to myself that we should\r\nbreakfast together;--we may trust to Francois; he has been here, to my\r\nknowledge, more than twenty years, and pleases every body.\"\r\n\r\nI pressed the hand of my new acquaintance--acknowledged myself to be\r\nfrom New Hampshire--gave my name, and received in return--\"Philip\r\nBelcher.\"\r\n\r\nWe sat down to the same table, and very soon Francois appeared with a\r\nwell-served breakfast.\r\n\r\n\"Pray,\" said I, \"what _can_ one do to relieve the monotony of this\r\nintolerable place? If the country about were agreeable--nay, if it were\r\nbearable! but as it is, I repeat, what is to be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Done!\" said Mr. Belcher, rather sharply, \"a hundred things! Put on your\r\nMackintosh and overshoes; come with me to the Courtgain, and see the\r\nfishermen putting to sea, their boats towed out by their wives and\r\ndaughters; a sight, I will be bound, you have not beheld, although you\r\nmay have coursed Europe over, and been at Calais half a dozen times.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Belcher proceeded in this vein, detailing many things that could be\r\nseen to advantage even in Calais; but as he suggested nothing which\r\ninterested me so much as he himself did, I had the boldness to tell him\r\nso, and that my curiosity was excited to know more of him.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing in my history that can amuse a stranger; indeed, it is\r\nwithout incident or marvel. To be sure, I am alone in the world, but I\r\nhave never been afflicted, or suffered misfortune, within my\r\nrecollection. My parents died when I was very young; my father and\r\nmother were both only children; a small property which the former left\r\nwas carefully invested, and faithfully nursed during my minority, by a\r\nscrupulous and honest lawyer, in no way connected with us, but whom my\r\nfather named as executor in his will, and my guardian. Ill health\r\nprevented my getting on at school. I can't say that I was an invalid,\r\nbut my constitution was delicate and my temperament nervous. I tried to\r\nmake some progress in the study of a profession, under my excellent\r\nguardian, but was forced to give it up as too trying to my nerves. The\r\nexcitement of a court-room I could not endure for a day, much less for a\r\nlifetime. Before I was twenty-five, my income had so much increased that\r\nI could afford to travel. I have gained in this way my health, which,\r\nhowever, would become impaired should I return to a sedentary life; so,\r\nas a matter of necessity, I have wandered about the world. You see my\r\nstory is soon told.\"\r\n\r\nI found Mr. Belcher was not in the habit of talking about himself, and I\r\nliked him the better for it. Without pressing for a more particular\r\naccount, I led the conversation to treat of the different countries he\r\nhad visited, referring, by the way, to some principal objects of\r\nattraction. Here I touched an idiosyncrasy of my new friend.\r\n\r\n\"I never formed,\" he said, \"any distinct 'plan' of travel. I never 'did'\r\nParis in eight days, nor the gallery of the Louvre in half an hour, as\r\nthey have been done by an acquaintance. I never opened a guide-book in\r\nmy life; I never employed a _commissionere_, a _valet_, a _courier_, a\r\n_cicerone_, or a _dragoman_. My pleasure has been to let the\r\nremarkable--the beautiful--the interesting--burst upon me without\r\nintroduction, and I have found my account in it. I have quitted the Val\r\nd'Arno, turned off from the Lake of Como, passed to the wrong side of\r\nLake Leman and its romantic castles, pursuing my way, regardless of\r\nthese well-worn attractions, while I beheld rarer--at least familiar\r\nscenes--and enjoyed with zest what was fresh and unhackneyed. No\r\neverlasting 'route'--no mercenary and dishonest landlords--no troops of\r\ntravellers, travelling that they may become 'travelled'--but in place of\r\nall this, I saw every thing naturally--the country in its\r\nsimplicity--the inhabitants in their simplicity--while, I trust, I have\r\npreserved my own simplicity. Indeed, I rather prefer what your tourist\r\ncalls an 'uninteresting region.'\"\r\n\r\n\"For that reason,\" I remarked, pleasantly, \"you have come here to Calais\r\nto spend a few weeks; you must enjoy the barren sand-plain which extends\r\nall the way from this to St. Omer. How picturesque are those pollards\r\nscattered along the road, with here and there a superannuated windmill,\r\nlooking like an ogre with three arms and no legs: then, to relieve the\r\ndreariness of the place, you have multitudes of miserable cabins,\r\ngrouped into more miserable villages, to say nothing of the chateaux of\r\ndingy red, in which painters of the brick-dust school so much delight.\r\nReally, Mr. Belcher, you will have a capital field here!\"\r\n\r\nMy new acquaintance shook his head a little seriously, as if deprecating\r\nfurther pleasantry.\r\n\r\n\"You are like the rest of them, I fear,\" he remarked, \"a surface\r\ntraveller; at least you will force me to believe so if you go on in this\r\nway. But come,\" he continued, \"the storm threatens to last the morning;\r\nif you wish, I will help to make away with part of it, by recounting a\r\nlittle adventure which happened to me hard by those very pollards, which\r\nyou are pleased to abuse so freely.\"\r\n\r\nIt is needless to add that I joyfully assented to the proposal, and was\r\nsoon seated in Mr. Belcher's room before a cheerful fire--for he had\r\nmanaged even in Calais to procure one--when he commenced as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I think it was during the first season I was on the continent, that I\r\nvisited St. Omer. After spending a day or two in that place, I concluded\r\nto walk to Calais, and set out one morning accordingly.\r\n\r\n\"The weather was fine; but after I had been a few hours on the road, the\r\nwind began to blow directly in my face, and soon enveloped me in a cloud\r\nof sand from which there seemed no escape, and which threatened actually\r\nto suffocate me. To avoid this I left the highway, but keeping what I\r\nsupposed to be in the general direction of the road, I struck out into\r\nthe adjacent fields. There was nothing for a considerable distance to\r\nrepay me for this _detour_, except that I thus was rid of the sand. The\r\ncountry was barren and uninteresting, the cottages little better than\r\nhovels, and the whole scene uninviting. But I pushed on, not a whit\r\ndiscouraged; indeed my spirits rose as the prospect darkened, and like a\r\nvaliant general invading a country for the purpose of conquering a\r\npeace, I resolved in some way to force an adventure before I reached\r\nCalais. I trudged along for hours, stopping occasionally for a draught\r\nof sour wine and a bit of bread. I made no inquiry about the main road,\r\nfor I preferred to know nothing of it. In this way I proceeded, until it\r\nwas almost night, when I spied, some half a mile distant, a cluster of\r\ntrees surrounding a small tenement. I turned at once toward the spot,\r\nand coming up to it, found a cottage not differing in size or structure\r\nfrom those I had seen on the way, except that it appeared even more\r\nantiquated. It was, however, in perfect repair, and finely shaded by a\r\nvariety of handsome trees, and flanked on one side by a neat garden. The\r\ndoor stood open and I entered. There was no one in the room. I called,\r\nbut received no answer. I strayed out into the garden and walked through\r\nit. At the lower end was a small inclosure covered over at the top as if\r\nto protect it from the weather, and fenced on each side with open\r\nwire-work, looking through which, I beheld a small grave, overspread\r\nwith mosses, and strewed with fresh-gathered white flowers. It bore no\r\nname or inscription, except the following simple but pathetic line;\r\n\r\n    \"Enfant cherie, avec toi mes beaux jours sont passes.--1794.\"\r\n\r\nSurprised by the appearance of fresh flowers upon a tomb which had been\r\nso long closed over its occupant, I turned, hoping to find some\r\nexplanation of the mystery, in what I might see elsewhere, But there was\r\nnothing near to attract one's attention, nor was any person within\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n\"After taking a glance around, I returned to the cottage, and walking\r\nin, sat down to wait the arrival of the occupants. In a few minutes, I\r\nheard voices from the side of the house opposite the garden, and soon\r\ntwo persons, of the peasant class, evidently husband and wife, came in.\r\nThe man was strong and robust, with the erect form and martial\r\nappearance acquired only by military service, and which the weight of\r\nnearly sixty years had not seemed to impair. His countenance was frank\r\nand manly, and his step firm. The woman appeared a few years younger,\r\nwhile the air of happy contentment which beamed in her face, put the\r\nordinary encroachments of time at defiance. Altogether, I had never seen\r\na couple so fitted to challenge observation and interest. They both\r\nstopped short on seeing me.\r\n\r\n\"I hastened to explain my situation, as that of a belated traveller,\r\nattracted by the sight of the cottage; and told them I was both hungry\r\nand tired, and desirous of the hospitality of their roof. I was made\r\nwelcome at once.\r\n\r\n\"Louis Herbois, for that was his name, gave me a bluff, soldierly\r\ngreeting, while Agathe, his wife, smiled her acquiescence. Supper was\r\nsoon laid; I ate with a sharpened appetite, which evidently charmed my\r\nhost, who encouraged me at intervals, as I began to flag.\r\n\r\n\"Supper concluded, I was glad to accept the offer of a bed--for I was\r\nexhausted with fatigue.\r\n\r\n\"I had been so engrossed with the repast, that curiosity was for the\r\ntime suspended, and it was not again in action until I had said\r\ngood-night to my entertainers, and found myself in the room where I was\r\nto sleep. This was an apartment of moderate size; the furniture was old\r\nand common, but neither dilapidated nor out of order; the bed was neatly\r\ncovered; around the room were scattered several books of interest, and\r\nin one corner was a neat writing-desk, of antiquated appearance, with\r\nsilver mounting, and handsomely inlaid; while some small articles of\r\nconsiderable value placed on a table in another corner, indicated at\r\nleast occasional denizens very different from the peasant and his wife.\r\nYet this could not be a rural resort for any family belonging to the\r\ntown. There were but two other apartments in the house, and these were\r\noccupied. Nevertheless, I reasoned, these things can never have been\r\nbrought here by the worthy people I have seen; and then--the little\r\ngrave in the garden? who has watched the tomb for so many years,\r\npreserving the moss so green and the flowers so fresh--cherishing an\r\naffection which has triumphed over time? How intense, how sacred, how\r\nstrange must be such devotion! I decided that some persons besides my\r\nhost were concerned, in some way, in the history of the little dwelling,\r\nand with this conclusion I retired; and so, being fatigued by my day's\r\ntravel, I soon fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\"I awoke about sunrise. Going to the window, I put aside the curtain,\r\nand looked out into the garden. Louis Herbois and his wife were there,\r\nrenewing the garlands with fresh flowers, and watering the moss which\r\nwas spread over the grave. It must be their own child, thought I, and\r\nyet--no--I will step out and ask them, and put an end to the mystery. I\r\nmet the good people coming in: they inquired if I had rested well, and\r\nsaid that breakfast would soon be ready. 'You do not forget your little\r\none,' I said to the old fellow, at the same time pointing towards the\r\ninclosure. 'Monsieur mistakes,' replied he, crossing himself devoutly.\r\n'Some dear friend, I suppose?' He looked at me earnestly: '_On voit\r\nbien, Monsieur, que vous etes un homme comme il faut._ After you have\r\nbreakfasted, you shall hear the story. 'Ah, there is then a story,' said\r\nI to myself, as I followed Louis Herbois into the cottage, where Agathe\r\nhad preceded us, and sat down to an excellent breakfast. When it was\r\nconcluded I asked for the promised narration. 'Let me see,' said Louis,\r\n'Agathe, how long have we been married?' Agathe, matron as she was,\r\nactually blushed at the question, yet answered readily, without stopping\r\nto compute the time. 'Yes; true; very well;' resumed Louis. 'You must\r\nknow, Monsieur, that my father was a soldier, and enrolled me, at an\r\nearly age, in the same company with himself. Having been detailed, soon\r\nafter, on service to one of the provinces, I was so severely wounded\r\nthat I was thought to be permanently unfitted for duty, and was\r\nhonorably dismissed with a life pension. Owing to the care and skill of\r\na famous surgeon who attended me, and whom I was fortunate enough to\r\ninterest, I was at last cured of my wounds, and very soon after I\r\nwandered away here, for no better reason, I believe, than that Agathe\r\nwas in the neighborhood; for we had known each other from the time we\r\nwere children. Very soon she and I were married, and we took this little\r\nplace, and were as blessed as possible.\r\n\r\n\"'In the mean time, great changes were going on at Paris. The revolution\r\nhad begun, and soon swept every thing before it. But it did not matter\r\nwith us. We rose with the birds, and went to rest with the sun, and no\r\ntwo could have been happier: am I not right, Agathe?' The old lady put\r\nher hand affectionately upon the shoulder of her husband, but said\r\nnothing. 'And we have never ceased being happy: we are always happy, are\r\nwe not Agathe?' The tears stood in Agathe's eyes, and Louis Herbois went\r\non. 'Well, the revolution was nothing to me, they were mad with it, and\r\nkilled the king, and slew each other, until our dear Paris became a\r\nbedlam--still, as I said, it was nothing to me. To be sure, I went\r\noccasionally to Calais, where I heard a new language in every body's\r\nmouth, and much talk of _Les hommes suspects, Mandats d'arrets_, with\r\nshouts of _Abas les aristocrates_, and _Vive la Republique_--but I did\r\nnot trouble myself about any of it; Agathe and I worked together in the\r\nfield, and in the garden, and in the house--always together--always\r\nhappy. One morning we went out to prune our vines, the door of the house\r\nwas open, just as you found it yesterday; why should we ever shut the\r\ndoor? we were honest, and feared nobody; we stood--Agathe here on this\r\nside holding the vine; I, with my knife, on the other side, bending over\r\nto lop a sprout from it; when down came two young people--lad and\r\nlass--upon us, as fast as they could run; out of breath--agitated--and\r\nas frightened as two wood-pigeons. The young man flew to me, and\r\ncatching hold of my arm begged me, _pour l'amour de Dieu_, to secrete\r\nhis wife somewhere--anywhere--out of the reach of the _gens-d'armes_,\r\nwho were pursuing them. I felt in ill-humor, for I had cut my finger\r\njust then; besides, I did not relish the mention of the _gens-d'armes_,\r\nso I replied plainly, that I would have nothing to do with persons who\r\nwere _suspects_. Why should I thrust my own neck into the trap? they had\r\nbetter go about their business, and not trouble poor people. Bah! such a\r\nspeech was not like Louis Herbois! but out it came, Heaven knows how,\r\nand no sooner had I finished than up runs the young creature, and\r\nseizing my moustache she cries, \"My brave fellow, hie away, and crop off\r\nall this; none but _men_ have a right to it; God grant you were not born\r\nin France; no Frenchman could give such an answer to a man imploring\r\nprotection for his wife. Look at my husband--did he ask aid for himself?\r\nDo you think he would turn you off in this way, had you sought his\r\nassistance to save _her_?\" pointing to Agathe, who stood trembling all\r\nthe while like an aspen. \"Ah! you have made a mistake, I see you repent,\r\nbe quick; what will you do with us?\" And she held me tight by the\r\nmoustache until I should answer, while the husband stared upon me in a\r\nsort of breathless agony. I took another look at the little creature,\r\nwhile she kept fast hold of me, and saw that she was----_eh bien_! I see\r\nyou understand me,' said Louis, interrupting himself, as he glanced\r\ntowards his wife. 'My heart knocked loud enough, believe me, and there\r\nthe dear little thing stood, her hand, as I was telling you, clenched\r\nfast in my moustache--ha! ha! ha!--and looking so full into my eyes,\r\nwith her own clear bright blue gazers. \"_Mon Dieu--mon Dieu!_ Agathe we\r\nmust help these _pauvres enfans_.\" \"You _are_ a Frenchman--I thought\r\nso,\" cried the little one, letting go my moustache and clapping her\r\nhands. \"Oh! hasten, hasten, or we are lost!\" \"All in good time,\" said I,\r\n\"for--\" \"No no,\" interrupted she, \"they are almost upon us: in a moment\r\nwe may be captured, and then Albert, oh, Albert, what will become of\r\nyou?\" So saying, she threw her arms about her husband, and clung to him\r\nas if nothing should part them. \"_Voila bien les femmes_; to the devil\r\nwith my caution; come with me, and I will put you in a place where the\r\nwhole Directory shall not find you, unless they pull my cottage down\r\nstone by stone.\" I hurried them to the house, and hid them in a private\r\ncloset which, following out my soldier-like propensities, I had\r\nconstructed in one end of the room, in a marvellously curious way. Not a\r\nsoul but Agathe knew of it, and I disliked to give up the secret, but I\r\nhurried the young people in, and arranged the place, and went back to\r\nthe vines and cut away harder than ever. In two minutes, up rode three\r\ndragoons with drawn swords, as fine looking troopers as one would ask\r\nfor. I saw them reconnoitre the cottage, then spying me, they came\r\ntowards us at a gallop. \"What have you done with the Comte and Comtesse\r\nde Choissy?\" said the leading horseman. \"You had better hold your\r\ntongue,\" I retorted, \"than be clattering away at random. What the devil\r\ndo I know of the Comte and Comtesse de Choissy, as you call them?\"\r\n\"Look, you,\" said the dragoon, laying his hand on my shoulder; \"the\r\npersons for whom I seek, are escaped prisoners; they were seen to come\r\nin the direction of this cottage; our captain watched them with his\r\nglass, and he swears they are here.\" \"And look you, Monsieur Cavalier, I\r\nam an old soldier, as you see, if scars and hard service can prove one,\r\nand it seems to me you should take an old soldier's word. I have said\r\nall I have to say; there is my house, the doors are open--look for\r\nyourself: come Agathe, we must finish our morning's work.\" So saying, I\r\nset at the vines harder than ever. I looked neither one way nor the\r\nother, but kept clipping, clipping, thus standing between the dragoons\r\nand poor Agathe, who was frightened terribly, although she tried to seem\r\nas busy as I. The rider who was spokesman, stared for a minute without\r\nsaying a word, and then broke out into a loud laugh. \"An old soldier\r\nindeed!--a regular piece of steel! one has but to point a flint at you,\r\nand the sparks fly.\" He turned to his men: \"Our captain was mistaken,\r\nevidently; this is a _bon camarade_; we may trust to him. We will take a\r\nturn through the cottage and push forward.\" With that he bid me good\r\nmorning, and after looking around the house the party made off.\r\n\r\n\"'\"Well, Agathe, what's to be done now?\" said I, when the dragoons were\r\nfairly out of sight. \"We have made a fine business of it.\" \"Ah, Louis,\"\r\nsaid she, \"let us not think of the danger; we have saved two innocent\r\nlives, for innocent I know they are: what if we _have_ perilled our own?\r\nHeaven will reward us.\" Nothing more was said, though we both thought a\r\ngreat deal, but we kept at our work as if nothing had happened. It was a\r\nlong time before I dared let the fugitives come from their hiding-place;\r\nfor I was afraid of that cursed glass of _Monsieur le Capitaine_. When I\r\ndid open it I found my prisoners nearly dead with suspense. We held a\r\ncouncil as to the best means for their concealment--for who would have\r\nhad the heart to turn the young people adrift?--and it was finally\r\nsettled that the comte and his wife should dress as peasants, and take\r\nwhat other means were necessary to alter their appearance, that they\r\nmight pass as such without suspicion. This was no sooner resolved than\r\ncarried out. Agathe was as busy as a bee, and in a few minutes had a\r\ndress ready for Victorine--we were to call her by her first name--who\r\nwas now as lively as a creature could be, running about the room,\r\nlooking into the glass, and making fun of her husband, who had in the\r\nmean time pulled on some of my clothes. After this, the young comte\r\nexplained to me that his father had died a short time before, leaving\r\nhim his title and immense estates, which, however, should he die\r\nchildless, would pass to an uncle, a man unscrupulous and of bad\r\nreputation. This uncle was among the most conspicuous of the\r\nrevolutionists. Through his agency the Comte de Choissy and his young\r\nwife, with whom he had been but a twelvemonth united, were arrested, and\r\nshortly after sentenced to death. They escaped from prison and the\r\nguillotine by the aid of a faithful domestic, and were almost at Calais\r\nwhen they discovered that they were pursued. By leaving the road and\r\nsending the carriage forward, they managed to gain the few moments which\r\nsaved them. Their principal fear now was from the wicked designs of the\r\nuncle, for the Directory had too much on their hands to hunt out escaped\r\nprisoners who were not specially obnoxious. For some days the young\r\npeople did not stir from the house, but were ever ready to resort to\r\ntheir hiding-place on the first alarm. There were, however, no signs of\r\nthe _gens-d'armes_ in the neighborhood. I went to Calais in a little\r\nwhile, and found, after much trouble, the old servant who was in the\r\ncarriage when the comte and his wife deserted it. He had been permitted\r\nto pass on without being molested, so alert were the soldiers in pursuit\r\nof the fugitives; and he had brought the few effects which he could get\r\ntogether for his master on leaving Paris to a safe place; and to prevent\r\nsuspicion, he himself had taken service with a respectable _traiteur_.\r\nBy degrees, I managed to bring off every thing belonging to my guests,\r\nand we fitted up the little room in which you passed the night, as\r\ncomfortably as possible, without having it excite remark from any one\r\ncasually entering it. \"Albert\" was industrious, aiding me at my work, no\r\nmatter what I was doing, and \"Victorine,\" too, insisted upon helping my\r\nwife in whatever she did, here, there, and everywhere, the liveliest,\r\nthe merriest, the most innocent creature I ever set eyes upon. But for\r\nall that, one could see that time hung heavy on the comte. He became\r\nthoughtful and _triste_, and like every man out of his proper place, he\r\nwas restless and uneasy. Not so the dear wife: she declared she had\r\nnever been so happy, that she had her Albert all to herself: wanted\r\nnothing more: if she but knew how to requite _us_, she would not wish\r\nthe estates back again--she would live where she was, forever. Then her\r\nhusband would throw his arms around her, and call her by endearing\r\nnames, which would make the little thing look so serious, but at the\r\nsame time so calm and satisfied and angel-like, that it seemed as if the\r\ndivine soul of the Holy Virgin had taken possession of her, as she\r\nturned her eyes up to her husband and met his, looking lovingly\r\ndown....'\r\n\r\n\"Here Louis Herbois stopped, and felt for his handkerchief, and blew his\r\nnose until the walls resounded, and wiped his eyes as if trying to\r\nremove something that was in them, and proceeded--\r\n\r\n\"'Any one to have seen her at different times would have sworn I had two\r\nlittle women for guests instead of one: so full of fun and mischief and\r\nall sorts of pranks; so lively, running hither and yon, teasing me,\r\namusing Agathe, rallying her husband; but on the occasions I mention, so\r\nsubdued, so thoughtful so--different from her other self: _Ciel!_ she\r\nhad all our hearts.\r\n\r\n\"'Several months passed, much in the same manner. The comte by degrees\r\ngained courage, and often ventured away from the house. Twice he had\r\nbeen to the town, but his wife was in such terror during his absence,\r\nthat he promised her he would not venture again. He continued meanwhile\r\nmoody and ill at ease; it would be madness to leave his place of\r\nconcealment; this he knew well enough; still he could not bring himself\r\nto be patient. Do not think, Monsieur, that the Comte de Choissy failed\r\nto love his wife just as ever: that was not it at all. A man is a man\r\nthe world about; the comte felt as any body would feel who finds himself\r\nrusting away like an old musket, which has been tossed aside into some\r\nmiserable cock-loft. I had seen the world and knew how it was with him.\r\nBut what could be done? In Paris things were getting worse and worse. At\r\nfirst we had _le Cote Gauche; les Montagnards; les Jacobines_: then came\r\n_les Patriotes de '93_; and after that, _les Patriotes par excellence_,\r\nwho were succeeded by _les Patriotes plus patriotes que les patriotes_:\r\nand then the devil was let loose in mad earnest; for what with _les\r\nBonnets-Rouges, les Enrages, les Terroristes, les Beveurs de Sang_, and\r\n_les Chevaliers du Poignard_, Paris was converted into a more fitting\r\nabode for Satan than his old-fashioned country residence down below.\r\n_Pardon Monsieur!_ I am getting warm; but it always stirs my blood when\r\nI recall those days. I see, too, I am getting from my story. Well: I\r\ntried to comfort the comte with such scraps of philosophy as I had\r\npicked up in my campaigns--for in the army, you must know, one learns\r\nmany a good maxim--but I did little by that. The sweet young comtesse\r\nwas the only one who could make him cheerful, and smile, and laugh, and\r\nseem happy in a natural way, for he loved her as tenderly as a man ever\r\nloved; besides, the comtesse had now a stronger claim than ever upon her\r\nhusband. I fancy I can see her sitting _there_, her face bent over,\r\nemploying her needle upon certain diminutive articles, whose use it is\r\nvery easy to understand. Do you know, when she was at work on _these_,\r\nthat she was serious--never playful--_always_ serious; wearing the same\r\nexpression as when she received from her husband a tender word? No:\r\nnothing could make her merry then. I used to sit and wonder how the\r\nself-same person could become so changed all in one minute. How the\r\ncomte loved to look at her! his eyes were upon her wherever she was; not\r\na word she spoke, not a step she took, not a motion of hers escaped him.\r\nWell, the time came at last, and by the blessing of God and the Holy\r\nVirgin, as beautiful a child as the world ever welcomed, was placed by\r\nmy Agathe in the arms of the comtesse. Perhaps,' added Louis Herbois, in\r\na lower voice, while speech seemed for the instant difficult, 'perhaps I\r\nhave remembered this the better, because God willed it that we ourselves\r\nshould be childless. When Agathe took the infant and laid it in the\r\nmother's bosom, the latter regarded it for a moment with an expression\r\nof intense fondness; then, raising her eyes to her husband, who stood\r\nover her, she laughed for joy.\r\n\r\n\"'Mother and daughter prospered apace. The little girl became the pet of\r\nthe house; we all quarelled for her; but each had to submit in turn. How\r\nintelligent! what speaking eyes! what knowing looks! what innocently\r\nmischievous ways! mother and child! I wish you could have seen them. I\r\nsoon marked a striking change: the young comtesse was now never herself\r\na child. A gentle dignity distinguished her--new-born, it would\r\nseem--but natural. I am making my story a long one, but I could talk to\r\nyou the whole day in this way. So, the months passed on--and the\r\nrevolution did not abate; and the comte was sick at heart, and the\r\ncomtesse was, as ever, cheerful, content, happy, and the little one\r\ncould stand alone by a chair and call out to us all, wherever we were.\r\nThe comte, notwithstanding his promise, could not resist his desire to\r\nlearn more of what was going on than I could inform him of. I seldom\r\nwent away, for when hawks are abroad, it is well to look after the\r\nbrood: and as I had nothing to gain, and every thing to lose, by\r\nventuring out, I thought it best to stay at home. The comte, on the\r\ncontrary, was anxious to know every thing. He had made several visits to\r\nCalais, first obtaining his wife's consent, although the agony she\r\nsuffered seemed to fill his heart with remorse; this, however, was soon\r\nsmothered by his renewed and unconquerable restlessness. One morning he\r\nwas pleading with her for leave to go again, answering her expressions\r\nof fear with the fact that he had been often already without danger.\r\n\"There is always a first time,\" said my Agathe, who was in the room.\r\n\"And there is always a last time, too,\" said I, happening to enter at\r\nthat moment. I did not know what they were talking about, and the words\r\ncame out quite at random. The comtesse turned pale. \"Albert,\" she said,\r\n\"content yourself with your Victorine and our babe: go not away from\r\nus.\" The infant was standing by its mother's knee, and without\r\nunderstanding what was said, she repeated, \"Papa--not go. The comte\r\nhesitated: \"What a foreboding company--croakers every one of you--away\r\nwith such presentiments of evil. Go I will, to show you how foolish you\r\nhave all been;\" and with that he snatched a kiss from his wife and the\r\nlittle one, and started off. The former called to him twice, \"Albert,\r\nAlbert!\" and the baby in imitation, with its little voice said, \"Papa,\r\npapa!\" but the comte did not hear those precious tones of wife or child,\r\nand in a few minutes he was out of sight. I cannot say what was the\r\nmatter with me; my spirit was troubled; the comtesse looked so\r\ndesponding, and Agathe so _triste_, that I knew not what to do with\r\nmyself. I did nothing for an hour, then I spoke to Agathe: \"Wife, I am\r\ngoing across to the town.\" She said, \"Ah, Louis, I almost wish you would\r\ngo. See how the comtesse suffers. I am sure I shall feel easier myself.\"\r\nThen I told her to say nothing of where I had gone, and away I went. It\r\ndid not take me long, for it seemed as if I ought to hasten. I got into\r\nthe town, and having walked along till I came to the Rue de Paris, I was\r\nabout turning down it when I saw a small concourse of people on the\r\nopposite corner; I crossed over and beheld the Comte de Choissy in the\r\ncustody of four _gens-d'armes_, and surrounded by a number of\r\n\"citizens.\" My first impulse was to rush to his assistance, but I\r\nreflected in time, and contented myself with joining the crowd. One of\r\nthe soldiers had gone for a carriage, and the remainder were questioning\r\nhim; the comte, however, would make no reply, except, \"You have me\r\nprisoner, I have nothing to say, do what you will.\" I waited quietly for\r\nan opportunity of showing myself to him, but he did not look toward me.\r\nPresently I said to the man next me, \"Neighbor, you crowd something too\r\nhard for good fellowship.\" The comte started a very little at the sound\r\nof my voice, but he did not immediately look up. Shortly he raised his\r\nhead and fixed his eyes on me for an instant only, and then turned them\r\nupon others of the company with a look as indifferent as if he were a\r\nmere spectator. What a courageous dog! by Heaven, he never changed an\r\niota, nor showed the slightest possible mark of recognition; still, I\r\nknew well enough he did recognize me, but I got no sign of it, neither\r\ndid he look towards me again. Soon the carriage came up and he was\r\nhurried in by the _gens-d'armes_, and off they drove! I made some\r\ninquiries, and found that the comte was known, and that they were taking\r\nhim to Paris.\r\n\r\n\"'It seems that he had been observed by a spy of the uncle during one of\r\nhis visits to the town, and although he was not tracked to his home--for\r\nhe was always very cautious in his movements--yet a strict watch was\r\nkept for his next appearance. I went to see the old domestic, but he\r\nknew not so much as I. My steps were next turned homeward. What a walk\r\nthat was for me? How could I enter my house the bearer of such tidings!\r\n\"_Bon Dieu! ah, bon Dieu_,\" I exclaimed, \"_ayez pitie!_\" and I stopped\r\nunder a hedge and got down on my knees and said a prayer, and then I\r\nbegan crying like a child. I said my prayer again, and walked slowly on;\r\nthen I saw the house, and Agathe in the garden, and the comtesse with\r\nthe little one standing in the door--looking--looking. I came\r\nup--\"Albert--where is Albert? where is my husband?\" I made no answer.\r\n\"Tell me,\" she said, almost fiercely, taking hold of my arm. I opened my\r\nmouth and essayed to speak, but although my lips moved I did not get out\r\na syllable. I thought I might whisper it, so I tried to do so, but I\r\ncould not whisper! The comtesse shrieked, the child began to cry, and\r\nAgathe came running in. \"Come with me,\" said I to my wife, and I went\r\ninto our chamber and told her the whole, and bid her go to the comtesse\r\nand tell the truth, for I could not. My dear Agathe went out half dead.\r\nI sat still in my chamber; presently the door opened, and the comtesse\r\nstood on the threshold. Her eyes were lighted up with fire, her\r\ncountenance was terribly agitated, her whole frame trembled: \"And you\r\nare the wretch base enough to let him be carried off to be butchered\r\nbefore your eyes without lifting voice or hand against it, without\r\ninterposing one word--one look, one thought! Cowardly recreant!\" she\r\nscreamed, and fell back in the arms of my wife in violent convulsions;\r\nthe infant looked on with wondering eyes and followed us as we laid the\r\ncomtesse on the bed, and then put her little hand on her mother's cheek,\r\nand said softly, \"Mamma.\" In a few minutes the comtesse began to\r\nrecover. She opened her eyes with an expression of intense pain, gave a\r\nglance at Agathe and me, and then observing her child, she took it, and\r\npressed it to her breast and sobbed. Shortly she spoke to me, and oh,\r\nwith what a mournful voice and look: \"Louis, forgive me; I said I knew\r\nnot what; I was beside myself. You have never merited aught from me but\r\ngratitude; will you forgive me?\" I cried as if I were a baby. Agathe too\r\nwent on so that I feared she could never be reconciled to the dreadful\r\ncalamity--for myself, I was well nigh mad. I could but commend the\r\ncomtesse to the Great God and hasten out of her sight. Five wretched and\r\nwearisome days were spent. The character of the comtesse meantime\r\ndisplayed itself. Instead of sinking under the weight of this sorrowful\r\nevent, she summoned resolution to endure it. She was devoted to her\r\nchild; she assumed a cheerful air when caressing it; she even tried to\r\nbusy herself in her ordinary occupations; but I could not be deceived, I\r\nknew the iron had entered her soul. All these heroic signs were only\r\nevidences of what she really suffered. Did I not watch her closely? and\r\nwhen the comtesse, folding her infant to her breast, raised her eyes to\r\nheaven as if in gratitude that it was left to her, I fancied there was\r\nan expression which seemed to say, \"Why were not _all_ taken?\" The\r\nlittle one, unconscious of its loss, would talk in intervals about\r\n\"papa;\" and when the mother, pained by the innocent prattle, grew sad\r\nof countenance, the child would creep into her lap, and putting its\r\nslender fingers upon her eyes, her lips, and over her face, would say,\r\n\"Am I not good, mamma? I am not naughty; I am good, mamma.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Five days were passed in this way; on the morning of the sixth, we\r\nwere startled by the comtesse, who, in manifest terror came to us\r\nholding her child, which was screaming as if suffering acute pain: its\r\neyes were bloodshot and gleamed with an unnatural brilliancy, its pulse\r\nrapid, and head so hot that it almost burned me to feel of it. Presently\r\nit became quiet for a few minutes, but soon the screams were renewed.\r\nAlas! what could we do? Agathe and I tried every thing that occurred to\r\nus, but to no purpose: the pains in the head became so intense that the\r\npoor thing would shriek as if some one was piercing her with a knife,\r\nthen she would lay in a lethargy, and again start and scream until\r\nexhausted. Not for a moment did the comtesse allow her darling to be out\r\nof her arms. For two days and two nights she neither took rest nor food;\r\nabsorbed wholly in her child's sufferings, she would not for a moment be\r\ndiverted from them. Agathe too watched night and day. On the third night\r\nthe child appeared much easier, and the comtesse bade Agathe go and get\r\nsome rest. She came and laid down for a little time and at last fell\r\nasleep; when she awoke it was daylight; she knocked at the door of the\r\ncomtesse--all was still;--she opened it and went in. The comtesse,\r\nexhausted by long watching, had fallen asleep in her chair, with her\r\nlittle girl in her arms. The child had sunk into a dull lethargic state\r\nnever to be broken. Alas! Monsieur--alas! the little one was dead!\r\nAgathe ran and called me. I came in. What a spectacle!... Which of us\r\nshould arouse the unhappy comtesse? or should we disturb her? Were it\r\nnot better gently to withdraw the dead child and leave the mother to her\r\n_repose_? We thought so. I stepped forward, but courage failed me. I did\r\nnot dare furtively to abstract the precious burden from the jealous arms\r\nwhich even in slumber were clasped tightly around it. Oh! my God!...\r\nWhile we were standing the comtesse opened her eyes: her first motion\r\nwas to draw the child closer to her heart--then to look at us--then at\r\nthe little one. She saw the whole. She had endured so much that this\r\nlast stroke scarcely added to her wretchedness. She allowed me to take\r\nthe child, and Agathe to conduct her to the couch and assist her upon\r\nit. She had held out to the point of absolute exhaustion, and when once\r\nshe had yielded she was unable to recall her strength. She remained in\r\nher bed quite passive, while Agathe nursed her without intermission. I\r\ndug a little grave in the garden yonder, and Agathe and I laid the child\r\nin it. The mother shed no tears; when from her bed she saw us carry it\r\naway she looked mournfully on, and as we went out she whispered, \"_Mes\r\nbeaux jours sont passes_.\" Soon the grave was filled up and flowers\r\nscattered over it, and we came back to the cottage. As I drew near her\r\nroom I beheld the comtesse at the window, supporting herself by a chair,\r\nregarding the grave with an earnest longing gaze which I cannot bear to\r\nrecall. As I passed, her eye met mine,--such a look of quiet enduring\r\nanguish, which combined in one expression a world of untold agonies! Oh!\r\nI never could endure a second look like that. I rushed into the house:\r\nAgathe was already in. I called to her to come to me, for I could not\r\nenter _that_ room again. \"Wife,\" I said, \"I am going to Paris. Do not\r\nsay one word. God will protect us. Comfort the comtesse. Agathe, if I\r\n_never_ return, remember--it is on a holy errand--adieu.\" I was off\r\nbefore Agathe could reply. I ran till I came to the main road, there I\r\nwas forced to sit down and rest. At last I saw a wagoner going forward;\r\npart of the way I rode with him, and a part I found a faster conveyance.\r\nAt night I walked by myself.\r\n\r\n\"'I had a cousin in Paris, Maurice Herbois, with whom in old times I had\r\nbeen on companionable terms. He was a smith, and had done well at the\r\ntrade until the revolution broke out, since then I had heard nothing\r\nfrom him. He was a shrewd fellow, and I thought he would be likely to\r\nkeep near the top of the wheel. But I had a perilous time after getting\r\ninto Paris before I could find him. I learned as many of the _canaille_\r\nwatchwords by heart as I could. I thought they would serve me if I was\r\nquestioned; but my dangers thickened, until I was at last laid hold of,\r\nfor not giving satisfactory answers, as _un homme sans aveu_, and was on\r\nthe point of being conveyed to a _maison d'arret_, when I mentioned the\r\nname of Maurice Herbois as a person who could speak in my favor. \"What,\"\r\nsaid one, \"_le Citoyen Herbois_?\" \"The very same,\" said I, \"and little\r\nthanks will you get from him for slandering his cousin with a charge of\r\n_incivisme_.\" There was a general shout at this, and off we hurried to\r\nfind Maurice. I had answered nothing of whence I came or where I was\r\ngoing, which was the reason I had at length got into trouble. I knew\r\nMaurice to be a true fellow, revolution or no revolution, and so\r\ndetermined to hold my peace till I should meet him. I found that he had\r\nbeen rapidly advanced by the tide of affairs, which had set him forward\r\nwhether he would or no. Indeed Maurice was no insignificant fellow at\r\nany rate. The noise of the men who carried me along, soon brought him\r\nout. I spoke first: \"Maurice, my dear cousin, I am glad to find you; but\r\nbefore we can shake hands, you must first certify my--loyalty,\" I was\r\nabout to say, but bit my tongue, and got out \"_civisme_.\" \"My friends,\"\r\nsaid Maurice, \"this is my cousin Louis Herbois, once a valiant soldier,\r\nnow a brave and incorruptible _citoyen_. He is trustworthy; he comes to\r\nvisit me; I vouch for him.\" This was so satisfactory, that we were\r\ngreeted with huzzas, and then I went in with Maurice. I need not tell\r\nyou how much passed between us. In short, we talked till our tongues\r\nwere tired. I found my cousin as I expected, true as a piece of his own\r\nsteel. He had been carried along, in spite of himself, in the course of\r\nrevolution, and had become a great man as the best chance of saving his\r\nhead. I told him my whole story, and the object of my visit. \"A\r\nfruitless errand, Louis,\" said he; \"I know the case; and where personal\r\nmalice is added to the ordinary motive for prosecution, there is no\r\nescape. Poor fellow, I wish I could help him; but the uncle, he is in\r\npower: ah! there is no help for it.\" Suddenly a new thought struck him.\r\n\"Louis, did you come by the Hotel de Ville?\" \"Yes.\" \"What was going on?\"\r\n\"I looked neither right nor left; I don't know.\" \"Well, what did you\r\nhear?\" \"I heard a cry of _Vive Tallien!_ with strange noises, and\r\nshouts, and yells; and somebody said that the National Guards were\r\ndisbanding, and had forsaken Robespierre; and the people were\r\nsurrounding the Hotel de Ville.\" \"Then, _Dieu merci_, there is hope. You\r\nare in the nick of time; let us out. If Robespierre falls, you may\r\nrescue the comte. He is in the Rue St. Martin; in the same prison is\r\nMadame de Fontenay, the _friend_ of Tallien, whom Robespierre has\r\nincarcerated. The former will proceed thither as soon as Robespierre is\r\ndisposed of, to free _Madame_; there will be confusion and much tumult.\r\nI know the keeper: I must be cautious; but I will discover where the\r\ncomte and the lady are secured. Then I will leave you with the jailer;\r\nthe crisis cannot be delayed another day. Wait till you hear them\r\ncoming, then shout _Vive Tallien!_ run about, dance around like a crazy\r\nman--hasten the jailer to release _Madame_, and do _you_ manage to\r\nrescue the comte--then be off instantly; don't come here again; strike\r\ninto the country while the confusion prevails. Come; let us go this\r\nminute.\" And I did go. I found Maurice's introduction potent with the\r\nkeeper, and what was better, I found the keeper to be an old companion\r\nin arms, who had belonged to the same company with me. We embraced; we\r\nwere like two brothers; nothing could have happened better. I learned\r\nfrom him all I cared to know. I staid hour after hour; just as I was in\r\ndespair at the delay, I heard the expected advance. I found my\r\nfellow-soldier understood what it meant. I began to shout _Vive\r\nTallien!_ as loud as I could cry. In a fit of enthusiasm I snatched the\r\nkeys from the hands of the keeper, as if to liberate the lady, while my\r\ncomrade opened the doors to the company. I hied first to the comte's\r\nroom. In one instant the door was unlocked. \"Quick!\" I whispered;\r\n\"follow me--do as I do. Shout, huzza; jump this way and that--but stick\r\nclose to me.\" In another minute I had unbolted the door of Madame de\r\nFontenay, making as much noise as I could get from my lungs--the comte\r\nkeeping very good time to my music. So, while we were shouting _Vive\r\nTallien!_ at the top of our voices, Tallien himself rushed in with a\r\nlarge party. I took the opportunity to gain the street, and without so\r\nmuch as thanking my comrade for his attentions, I glided into an\r\nunfrequented lane, the comte at my heels; and I did not stop, nor look\r\naround, nor speak, till I found myself under cover of an old windmill\r\nnear St. Denis, where I used to play when I was a boy. There I came to a\r\nhalt, and seizing the comte in my arms, I embraced him a thousand times.\r\nI look some provisions from my pouch, which my cousin had provided, and\r\nbade him eat, for we should stand in need of food. We then proceeded,\r\navoiding the main road, and getting a ride whenever we could, but never\r\nwasting a moment--not a moment. I told the comte what had happened, and\r\nthat he must hasten if he would see his wife alive. At last we came near\r\nour house. The comte could scarcely contain himself; he ran before me: I\r\ncould not keep up with him. How my heart was filled with\r\nforeboding!--how I dreaded to come nearer!--but apprehension was soon at\r\nan end. There was my little cottage, and in the doorway, leaning for\r\nsupport against the side, stood the comtesse, gazing on vacancy--the\r\npicture of despair and desolation. At the sight of her husband, she\r\nthrew out her hands and tried to advance: she was too feeble, and would\r\nhave fallen had he not the same moment folded her in his arms.\r\n\r\n\"'_Bien Monsieur!_' continued Louis Herbois, after clearing his voice,\r\n'the worst of the story is told. The comtesse was gradually restored to\r\nhealth, and the comte was content to remain quietly with us till the\r\nstorm swept past; but the lady never recovered the bright spirits which\r\nshe before displayed, and the comte himself could never speak of the\r\nlittle one whom he kissed for the last time on that fatal morning,\r\nwithout the deepest emotion. It seems to have been destined that this\r\nshould be their only affliction. The uncle was beheaded in one of the\r\nsudden changes of parties the succeeding year, and in due time the comte\r\nregained his estates. Sons and daughters were born to them, and their\r\nfamily have grown up in unbroken numbers. The comte and comtesse can\r\nscarcely yet be called old, their health and vigor remain, and they\r\nenjoy still those blessings which a kind Providence is pleased to bestow\r\non the most favored. But the Comtesse de Choissy will never forget the\r\nchild which lies _there_. Twice a year, accompanied by the comte, she\r\nvisits the cottage. She lays with her own hands fresh flowers over the\r\nlittle grave, and waters the moss which overspreads it; and the tears\r\nstand in her eyes when she looks upon the spot where we buried her\r\n_first-born_. We have engaged that every morning we will renew the\r\nflowers, and preserve the mosses always green. It is a holy office,\r\nconsecrated by holy feelings. Ah! life is a strange business: we may not\r\nbe always serious, we cannot be always gay. God grant, Monsieur, that in\r\nheaven we may all be happy!'\r\n\r\n\"I have given you the whole story,\" said Mr. Belcher, after a short\r\npause; \"but look, the sun is out; let us go to the Courtgain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Fraser's Magazine.]\r\n\r\nLIFE AT A WATERING-PLACE.\r\n\r\nOLDPORT SPRINGS.\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES ASTOR BRISTED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Hold on a minute,\" said Harry, as they were about to take the stage,\r\nafter a very fair three-o'clock dinner at Constantinople (the\r\nOccidental, not the Oriental city of that name); \"there goes an\r\nacquaintance of ours whom you must know. He has arrived by the Westfield\r\ntrain, doubtless.\"\r\n\r\nAway sped Benson after the acquaintance, arm-in-arm with whom he shortly\r\nreturned, and, with all the exultation of an American who has brought\r\ntwo lions into the same cage, introduced M. le Vicomte Vincent Le Roi to\r\nthe honorable Edward Ashburner.\r\n\r\nAshburner was rather puzzled at Le Roi, whose personal appearance did\r\nnot in any way answer, either to his originally conceived idea of a\r\nFrenchman, or to the live specimens he had thus far met with. The\r\nVicomte looked more like an Englishman, or perhaps like the very best\r\nkind of Irishman. He was a middle-sized man, of thirty or thereabout,\r\nwith brown hair and a florid complexion; and very quietly dressed, his\r\nclothes being neither obtrusively new nor cut with any ultra-artistic\r\npretension. Except his wearing a moustache and (of course) not speaking\r\nEnglish, there was nothing continental about his outward man, or the\r\nfirst impression he gave of himself. Fortunately, he was also bound for\r\nthe Springs, so that Ashburner would have abundant opportunity to study\r\nhis character, if so disposed.\r\n\r\nThe stage in which our tourists were to embark was not unlike a French\r\ndiligence, except that it had but one compartment instead of three; in\r\nwhich compartment there were three seats, and on each seat more or less\r\nroom for three persons, and two more could sit with the driver. All the\r\nbaggage was carried on the top. The springs were made like\r\ncoach-springs, or C-springs, as they are always called in America (just\r\nas in England a pilot-coat is called a P-jacket), only they were upright\r\nand perpendicular to the axletree instead of curving; and the leathern\r\nbelts connected with them, on which the carriage swung, were of the\r\nthickest and toughest description. As the party, with the addition of Le\r\nRoi, amounted to eight, Benson managed, by a little extra expenditure of\r\ntin and trouble, to secure the whole of one vehicle, and for the still\r\ngreater accommodation of the ladies and child, the gentlemen were to sit\r\non the box two at a time by turns. Benson's first object was to get hold\r\nof the reins, for which end he began immediately to talk around the\r\ndriver about things in general. From the price of horses they diverged\r\nto the prospects of various kinds of business, and thence slap into the\r\npolitics of the country. The driver was a stubborn Locofoco, and Benson\r\ndid not disdain to enter into an elaborate argument with him. Ashburner,\r\nwho then occupied the other box-seat, was astonished at the man's\r\nstatistical knowledge, the variety of information he possessed upon\r\nlocal topics, and his accurate acquaintance with the government and\r\ninstitutions of his country. It occurred to him to prompt Benson,\r\nthrough the convenient medium of French, to sound him about England and\r\nEuropean politics. This Harry did, not immediately, lest he might\r\nsuspect the purport of their conversational interlude, but by a\r\ndexterous approach to the point after sufficient preliminary; and it\r\nthen appeared that he had lumped \"the despotic powers of the old world\"\r\nin a heap together, and supposed the Queen of England to be on a par\r\nwith the Czar of Russia as regarded her personal authority and\r\nprivileges. However, when Benson set him right as to the difference\r\nbetween a limited and an absolute monarchy, he took the information in\r\nvery good part, listened to it attentively, and evidently made a mental\r\nnote of it for future reference.\r\n\r\nThe four-horse team was a good strong one, but the stage with its load\r\nheavy enough, and the roads, after the recent storm, still heavier,\r\nbesides being a succession of hills. The best they could do was to make\r\nsix miles an hour, and they would not have made three but for a method\r\nof travelling down-hill, entirely foreign to European ideas on the\r\nsubject. When they arrived at the summit there was no talk of putting on\r\nthe drag, nor any drag to put on, but away the horses went, first at a\r\nrapid trot, and soon at full gallop; by which means the equipage\r\nacquired sufficient momentum to carry it part of the way up the next\r\nhill before the animals relapsed into the slow walk which the steepness\r\nof the ascent imposed upon them. Indeed this part of the route would\r\nhave been a very tedious one (for the country about was almost entirely\r\ndevoid of interest), had it not been for Le Roi, who came out in great\r\nforce. He laughed at every thing and with every body; told stories, and\r\ngood ones, continuously, and only ceased telling stories to break forth\r\ninto song. In fine, he amused the ladies so much, that when he took his\r\nturn on the box they missed him immediately, and sent Benson outside\r\nagain on the first opportunity; whereat the Vicomte, being very much\r\nflattered, waxed livelier and merrier than ever, and kept up a constant\r\nfire of jest and ditty. As to Ashburner, who had a great liking for\r\nfresh air, and an equal horror of a small child in a stage-coach, he\r\nremained outside the whole time; for which the fair passengers set him\r\ndown as an insensible youth, who did not know how to appreciate good\r\ncompany; until the evening becoming somewhat chilly by comparison with\r\nthe very hot day they had undergone, both he and Harry took refuge in\r\nthe interior, and a very jolly party they all made.\r\n\r\nWhile they were outside together, Benson had been giving Ashburner some\r\ndetails about Le Roi--in fact, a succinct biography of him; for be it\r\nnoted, that every New-Yorker is able to produce off-hand a minute\r\nhistory of every person, native or foreign, at all known in society: for\r\nwhich ability he is indebted partly to the inquisitive habits of the\r\npeople, partly to their communicative disposition, partly to their\r\nremarkable memory of small particulars, and partly to a fine imagination\r\nand power of invention, which must be experienced to be fully\r\nappreciated. Benson, we say, had been, telling his friend the story of\r\nhis other friend or acquaintance; how he was of good family and no\r\nfortune; how he had written three novels and three thousand or more\r\n_feuilletons_; how he had travelled into some out-of-the-way part of\r\nPoland, where no one had ever been before or since, and about which he\r\nwas, therefore, at liberty to say what he pleased; how, besides his\r\nliterary capabilities, such as they were, he played, and sang, and\r\ndanced, and sketched--all very well for an amateur; how he was\r\naltogether a very agreeable and entertaining man, and, as such, was\r\nsupposed to have been sent out by a sort of mutual-benefit\r\nsubscription-club, which existed at Paris for the purpose of marrying\r\nits members to heiresses in different countries. Ashburner had once\r\nheard rumors of such a club in Germany, but was never able to obtain any\r\nauthentic details concerning it, or to determine whether it was any\r\nthing more than a traveller's traditionary legend. Even Benson was at\r\nfault here, and, indeed, he seemed rather to tell the club part of the\r\nstory as a good joke, than to believe it seriously himself.\r\n\r\nAs they approached the termination of their journey, their talk\r\nnaturally turned more and more on the Springs. The Vicomte was in\r\npossession of the latest advices thence; the arrivals and expected\r\narrivals, and the price-current of stock: that is, of marriageable young\r\ngentlemen, and all other matters of gossip; how the whole family of the\r\nRobinsons was there in full force, with an unlimited amount of Parisian\r\nmillinery; how Gerard Ludlow was driving four-in-hand, and Lowenberg had\r\ngiven his wife no end of jewelry; how Mrs. Harrison, who ought not to\r\nhave been (not being of our set), nevertheless _was_ the great lioness\r\nof the season; how Miss Thompson, the belle expectant, had renounced the\r\nSprings altogether, and shut herself up at home somewhere among the\r\nmountains--all for unrequited love of Hamilton White, as was charitably\r\nreported; last, but not least, how Tom Edwards had invented six new\r\nfigures for the German cotillon. Ashburner did not at first altogether\r\nunderstand the introduction of this personage into such good company,\r\nsupposing from his familiar abbreviation and Terpsichorean attributes\r\nthat he must be the fashionable dancing-master of Oldport, or perhaps of\r\nNew-York; but he was speedily given to understand that, on the contrary,\r\nMr. Edwards was a gay bachelor of good family and large fortune, who, in\r\naddition to gambling, intriguing, and other pleasant little\r\npropensities, had an insatiable passion for the dance, and was\r\naccustomed to rotate morning, noon, and night, whenever he was not\r\ngambling, &c. as aforesaid. \"And,\" continued Benson, \"I'll lay you any\r\nbet you please, that the first thing we see on arriving at our hotel,\r\nwill be Tom Edwards dancing the polka; unless, indeed, he happen to be\r\ndancing the Redowa.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely,\" said Mrs. Benson, \"seeing we shall arrive there at ten\r\no'clock, and this is a ball-night.\"\r\n\r\nBoth Harry and his wife were right; they arrived at half-past ten, just\r\nas the ball was getting into full swing. On the large portico in front\r\nof the large hotel opened a large room, with large windows down to the\r\nfloor,--the dining-room of the establishment, now cleared for dancing\r\npurposes. All the idlers of Oldport, male and female, black and white,\r\ncongregated at these windows and thronged the portico; and almost into\r\nthe very midst of this crowd our party was shot, baggage and all. While\r\nAshburner was looking out of a confused heap of people and luggage, he\r\nheard one of the assistant loafers say to another, \"Look at Mr.\r\nEdwards!\" Profiting by the information not originally intended for him,\r\nhe followed the direction of the speaker's nose, and beheld a little\r\nshowily-dressed man flying down the room with a large showily-dressed\r\nwoman, going the _poursuite_ of the Redowa at a terrific rate. So that,\r\nliterally, the first thing he saw in Oldport was Tom Edwards dancing.\r\nBut there was no opportunity to make a further study of this, \"one of\r\nthe most remarkable men among us,\" for the party had to look up their\r\nnight quarters. Benson had dispatched in advance to Mr. Grabster,\r\nproprietor of the Bath Hotel at Oldport Springs, a very particular\r\nletter, stating the number of his party, the time he meant to be there,\r\nand the number of rooms he wanted, and had also sent his horses on\r\nahead; but though the animals had arrived safe and found stable-room,\r\nthere was no preparation for their master. Ashburner, at the request of\r\nthe ladies, followed Benson into the office (for the Bath Hotel being,\r\nnominally at least, the first house in the place, had its bar-room and\r\noffice separate), and found Harry in earnest expostulation with a\r\nmagnificently-dressed individual, whom he took for Mr. Grabster himself,\r\nbut who turned out to be only that high and mighty gentleman's head\r\nbook-keeper. The letter had been dispatched so long beforehand that,\r\neven at the rate of American country posts, it ought to have\r\narrived, but no one knew any thing about it. Both the young men\r\nsuspected--uncharitably, perhaps, but not altogether unnaturally--that\r\nMr. Grabster and his aids, finding a prospect of a full season, had not\r\nthought it worth their while to trouble themselves about the\r\napplication, or to keep any rooms. Ashburner suggested trying another\r\nhotel, but the roads were muddy, and vehicles scarce at that time of\r\nnight, so that altogether there seemed a strong probability of their\r\nbeing compelled to \"camp out\" on the portico. But it was not in Benson\r\n\"to give it up so.\" He possessed, as we have already hinted, that\r\nfaculty so alarmingly common in his country, which polite people call\r\noratory, and vulgar ones the \"gift of the gab;\" and he was not the man\r\nto throw away the opportunity of turning any of his gifts to account.\r\nWarming with his subject, he poured out upon the gorgeously-attired Mr.\r\nBlack such a flood of conciliatory and expostulatory eloquence, that\r\nthat gentleman absolutely contrived to find some accommodation for them.\r\nThe ladies, child, and servants were huddled together into one tolerably\r\nlarge room, in the third story. Benson had a sort of corner-cupboard in\r\nthe fourth, that might, perhaps, have accommodated a mouse with a small\r\nfamily; and to Ashburner and Le Roi were assigned two small chambers in\r\nthe fifth. As to the baggage, that was all piled up in the office, with\r\nthe exception of a few indispensable articles. Supper was out of the\r\nquestion, there being no room to eat it in because of the dancers. The\r\nladies did not want supper; they only regretted not being able to unpack\r\ntheir trunks, and dress for the ball then and there going on; their eyes\r\nlighted up at the sound of the music, and their little feet began to\r\nbeat the floor incontinently. The gentlemen took a drink all round by\r\nway of substitute for something more solid. Ashburner had mounted to his\r\ndormitory--no small journey--and was sitting on his bed, wishing he had\r\nsome contrivance for pulling off all his clothes at once without the\r\ntrouble of removing them piece by piece, when he heard in the passage\r\nthe voice of Le Roi, _quantum mutatus ab illo_! The Vicomte had sworn up\r\nall his own language, and was displaying a knowledge of English\r\nexpletives that quite surprised his fellow-traveller. On investigation,\r\nthe cause of his wrath proved to be this: a semi-civilized Irish waiter\r\nhad shown him to No. 296, in accordance with Mr. Black's directions. But\r\nMr. Black, in the multiplicity of his affairs, had forgotten that No.\r\n296 was already tenanted, to wit, by a Western traveller, who did,\r\nindeed, intend to quit it by an early stage next morning, but had not\r\nthe least idea of giving up his quarters before that time; and\r\naccordingly, as if from a presentiment that some attempt would be made\r\nto dislodge him, had, in addition to the ordinary not very strong\r\nfastenings of the door, so barricaded it with trunks and furniture, that\r\nit could have stood a considerable amount of siege. The waiter had gone\r\noff, leaving Le Roi to shift for himself. Bells were scarce in the upper\r\nstories of the Bath Hotel, nor was there any light throughout the long\r\ncorridor, except the one tallow candle which his useless guide had\r\ndeposited on the floor. Utterly upset at the idea of having to tramp\r\ndown four pair of stairs and back again in search of accommodation, the\r\nunlucky Gaul was seeking a momentary relief in the manner above stated,\r\nwhen Ashburner came to the rescue. His bed happened to be rather a large\r\none--so large, comparatively, that it was a mystery how it had ever\r\nfound its way into the little room, the four walls of which seemed to\r\nhave grown or been built up around it; and this bed he instantly\r\nproposed to share with Le Roi for the night. The Frenchman _mercied_,\r\nand couldn't think of such a thing for five minutes, edging into the\r\nroom and pulling off his coat and boots all the time; then he gave a\r\nglorious exemplification of _cessanta causa_, for all his rage vanished\r\nin a moment, and he was the same exuberantly good-natured and profusely\r\nloquacious man that he had been all day. On he streamed in a perpetual\r\nflow of talk long after both were in bed, until Ashburner began to feel\r\nas a man might to whom some fairy had given a magical instrument, which\r\ndiscoursed sweet music at first, but could never be made to stop\r\nplaying. And when at length the Vicomte, having lighted on the subject\r\nof women, poured out an infinity of adventures with ladies of all\r\ncountries, of all which stories Vincent Le Roi was, of course, the hero,\r\nhis fellow-traveller, unable to help being disgusted at his vanity and\r\nlevity, turned round to the wall, and without considering whether he was\r\nacting in accordance with _bienseance_, fell fast asleep in the midst of\r\none of the most thrilling narratives.\r\n\r\nWhen Ashburner awoke next morning, the first thing he was conscious of\r\nwas Le Roi talking. It required very little exercise of the imagination\r\nto suppose that he had been going on uninterruptedly all night.\r\nAfterwards he became aware of a considerable disturbance, evidently\r\noriginating in the lower story of the house, but sufficiently audible\r\nall over it, which he put down to the account of numerous new arrivals.\r\nBy the time they had completed their toilettes (which did not take very\r\nlong, for the room being just under the roof, was of a heat that made it\r\ndesirable for them to evacuate it as soon as possible), Benson made his\r\nappearance. He had obtained possession of his baggage, and arrayed\r\nhimself in the extreme of summer costume:--a white grass-cloth coat,\r\nabout the consistency of blotting-paper, so transparent that the lilac\r\npattern of his check shirt was distinctly visible through the arms of\r\nit; white duck vest, white drilled trousers, long-napped white hat, a\r\nspeckled cravat to match his shirt, and highly varnished shoes, with red\r\nand white striped silk stockings,--altogether very fresh and\r\ninnocent-looking. He came to show them the principal spring, which was\r\nnot far from the hotel--just a pleasant walk before breakfast, though\r\nit was not likely they would meet many people so early, on account of\r\nlast night's ball.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid your quarters were not very comfortable,\" said Harry, as\r\nthe three strolled arm-in-arm down a sufficiently sandy road; \"but we\r\nshall have better rooms before dinner to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"The house must be very full,\" Ashburner remarked; \"and were there not a\r\ngreat many arrivals this morning? From the noise I heard, I thought at\r\nleast fifty people had come.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I glanced at the book, and there were not a dozen names on it.\r\nHallo!\" and Benson swore roundly in Spanish, apparently forgetting that\r\nhis friend understood that language.\r\n\r\nAshburner looked up, and saw meeting them a large Frenchman and a small\r\nIrish boy. The Frenchman had an immense quantity of hair of all sorts on\r\nhis face, nearly hiding his features, which, as what was visible of them\r\nhad a particularly villainous air, was about the best thing he could\r\nhave done to them; and on his head he carried a something of felt, which\r\nindisputably proved the proposition that matter may exist without form.\r\nThe Irish youth sported a well-meant, but not very successful attempt at\r\na moustache, and a black cloth cap pitched on one side of his head. In\r\nother respects, they were attired in the usual costume of an American\r\nsnob; that is to say, a dress-coat and full suit of black at seven in\r\nthe morning. Ashburner noticed that Benson spit ostentatiously while\r\npassing them; and after passing he swore again, this time in downright\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nLe Roi had seen in his acquaintance with European watering-places, a\r\ngoodly amount of scamps and blacklegs, and Ashburner was not without\r\nsome experience of the sort, so that they were not disposed to be\r\ncurious about one blackguard more or less in a place of the kind; but\r\nthese two fellows had such a look of unmitigated rascality, that both\r\nthe foreigners glanced inquiringly at their friend, and were both on the\r\npoint of asking him some questions, when he anticipated their desire.\r\n\r\n\"God forgive me for swearing, but it is too provoking to meet these\r\nloafers in respectable quarters. The ancients used to think their\r\njourney spoiled if they met an unclean animal on starting, and I feel as\r\nif my whole stay here would go wrong after meeting these animals the\r\nfirst thing in the first morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Mais qu'est ce qu'ils sont donc, ces vaut-riens?_\" asked Le Roi.\r\n\r\n\"The Frenchman is a deported convict, who is doing us the honor to serve\r\nout his time here; the Irishman is a refugee, I believe. They have come\r\nhere to report for _The Sewer_.\"\r\n\r\nThey cooled their virtuous indignation in the spring, and were\r\nreturning.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo, Benson! Hallo! I thought that was you!\" shouted somebody, a\r\nquarter of a mile off, from the hotel steps.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said Harry, \"I understand now why you heard so much noise this\r\nmorning. Bird Simpson has arrived.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Simpson, popularly known as \"the bird\" (_why_ no one could tell\r\nexactly, but people often get such names attached to them for some\r\ninexplicable reason), came on a half-run to meet them. He was a tall,\r\nshowy, and rather handsome, though not particularly graceful man; very\r\nflashily got up in a blue cutaway with gilt buttons, wide blue stripes\r\ndown the sides of his white trousers, a check shirt of enormous crimson\r\npattern, and a red and white cravat; no waistcoat, and wide embroidered\r\nbraces, the work of some lady friend. He seemed to have dressed himself\r\non the principle of the tricolor, and to have carried it out in his\r\nface--his cheeks being very red, his eyes very blue, and his hair very\r\nwhite. After having pump-handled Benson's arm for some time, he made an\r\nattack on Le Roi, whom he just knew by name, and inquired if he had just\r\ncome _de l'autre cote_, meaning the other side of the Atlantic,\r\naccording to a common New-York idiom; but the Vicomte not unnaturally\r\ntook it to mean from the other side of the road, and gave a\r\ncorresponding answer in English as felicitous as Mr. Simpson's French.\r\nThen he digressed upon Ashburner, whom he saw to be an Englishman, in so\r\npointed a manner, that Benson was obliged to introduce them; and the\r\nintroduction was followed by an invitation on Simpson's part to the\r\ncompany to take a drink, which they did, somewhat to the consternation\r\nof the Frenchman, who knew not what to make of iced brandy and mint\r\nbefore breakfast. Then Simpson, having primed himself for the morning\r\nmeal, set about procuring it, and his departure visibly relieved Benson,\r\nwho was clearly not proud of his acquaintance. Le Roi also went after\r\nhis breakfast, taking care to get as far as possible from the corner of\r\nthe room where Simpson was.\r\n\r\n\"There,\" said Benson, \"is a very fair specimen of 'second set.' He is B,\r\nNo. 1, rather a great man in his own circle, and imports French goods.\r\nTo hear him talk about French actresses and eating-houses, you would\r\nthink him a ten-years' resident of that city, instead of having been\r\nthere perhaps four times in his life, a week each time. But you know we\r\nAmericans have a wonderful faculty of seeing a great deal in a little\r\ntime. Just so with Italy; he was there two months, and professes to know\r\nall about the country and the people. But he doesn't know the set abroad\r\nor at home. Sometimes you meet him at a ball, where he does his duty\r\nabout supper time; but you will never see him dancing with, or talking\r\nto, the ladies who are 'of us.' Nevertheless, they will avail themselves\r\nof his services sometimes, when they want to buy silks at wholesale\r\nprices, or to have something smuggled for them; for he is the\r\nbest-natured man in the world. And, after all, he is not more given to\r\nscandal than the exquisites, and is a great deal honester and truer.\r\nOnce I caught a fever out on the north-eastern boundary, and had not a\r\nfriend with me, or any means of getting help. This man nursed me like a\r\nbrother, and put himself to no end of trouble for me until we could\r\nfetch Carl on. I would certainly rather have been under such an\r\nobligation to some other men I know than to Simpson; but having\r\nincurred it, I do not think it can be justly paid off with a\r\n'glad-to-know-you-when-I'm-at-Bath-again' acquaintance; and I feel bound\r\nto be civil to him, though he does bother me immensely at times with his\r\nfree-and-easy habits,--walking into my parlor with his hat on and cigar\r\nin his mouth; chaffing me or my wife in language about as elegant as an\r\nomnibus driver's; or pawing ladies about in a way that he takes for\r\ngallantry. Talking of ladies, I wish mine would show themselves for\r\nbreakfast. Ah, here are two men you must know; they are good types of\r\ntwo classes of our beaux--the considerably French and the slightly\r\nEnglish--the former class the more numerous, you are probably aware. Mr.\r\nWhite, Mr. Ashburner--Mr. Ashburner, Mr. Sumner.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton White was a tall, handsome man, some few years on the wrong\r\nside of thirty, broader-shouldered and deeper-chested than the ordinary\r\nAmerican model, elaborately but very quietly dressed, without any\r\njewelry or showy patterns. There was something very Parisian in his\r\nget-up and manner, yet you would never take him for a Frenchman, still\r\nless for a Frenchified-Englishman. But he had the look of a man who had\r\nlived in a gay capital, and quite fast enough for his years: his fine\r\nhair was beginning to go on the top of his head, and his face wanted\r\nfreshness and color. His manner, slightly reserved at first, rapidly\r\nwarmed into animation, and his large dark eyes gave double expression to\r\nwhatever he said. His very smallest talk was immensely impressive. He\r\nwould tell a stranger that he was happy to make his acquaintance with an\r\nair that implied all the Spaniard's _mi casa a la disposicion de usted_,\r\nand meant about as much; and when you saw him from the _parquet_ of the\r\nOpera talking to some young lady in the boxes, you would have imagined\r\nthat he was making a dead set at her, when in fact he was only uttering\r\nsome ordinary meteorological observation. Apart from his knack of\r\nlooking and talking sentiment, he had no strongly-marked taste or hobby:\r\ndanced respectably, but not often; knew enough about horses to pick out\r\na good one when he wanted a mount for a riding-party; drank good wine\r\nhabitually, without being pedantic about the different brands of it; and\r\nread enough of the current literature of the day to be able to keep up a\r\nconversation if he fell among a literary circle. He was not a marrying\r\nman, partly because his income, sufficient to provide him with all\r\nbachelor luxuries, was not large enough to support a wife handsomely;\r\npartly because that a man should tie himself to one woman for life was a\r\nthing he could not conceive, much less practice: but he very much\r\naffected the society of the softer sex, and was continually amusing\r\nhimself with some young girl or young wife. He rather preferred the\r\nlatter--it was less compromising; still he had no objection to victimize\r\nan innocent _debutante_, and leave her more or less broken-hearted. (It\r\nmust be observed, however, for the credit of American young ladies, that\r\nthey are not addicted to dying of this complaint, so often fatal in\r\nnovels; many of Hamilton's victims had recovered and grown absolutely\r\nfat upon it, and married very successfully.) Wherever there was a\r\n_fiancee_, or a probable _fiancee_, or a married belle with an uxorious\r\nhusband,--in short, wherever he could make himself look dangerous and\r\nanother man jealous or foolish, he came out particularly strong; at the\r\nsame time, being adroit and not over belligerent, he always contrived to\r\nstop or get out of the way in time if the other party showed open signs\r\nof displeasure.\r\n\r\nFrank Sumner was rather shorter than White, rather younger, and rather\r\nmore dressed. He had the same broad shoulders, which in America, where\r\nmost of the beaux are either tall and thin or short and thin, find favor\r\nwith the ladies; just as blondes create a sensation in southern\r\ncountries, because they are so seldom seen. In almost all other\r\nparticulars, the two men were totally unlike, and Sumner might have\r\npassed for an English gentleman put into French clothes. He was reserved\r\nin his conversation, and marked in the expression of his likes and\r\ndislikes. With no more intention of marrying than White, he took care\r\nnever to make love to any woman, and if any woman made love to him, he\r\ngave her no encouragement. He was not richer than White, not so\r\ngood-looking, and certainly not so clever, but more respected and more\r\ninfluential; for the solid and trustworthy parts of his character,\r\nbacked by a bull-dog courage and an utter imperturbability, got the\r\nbetter in the long run of the other's more brilliant qualities.\r\n\r\nSome of these things Ashburner observed for himself, some of them Benson\r\ntold him after White and Sumner, who did _not_ ask the stranger to take\r\na drink, had passed on. He had noticed that the latter's manner, though\r\nperfectly civil, was very cold compared with the _empressement_ which\r\nthe former had exhibited.\r\n\r\n\"He doesn't like your countrymen,\" said Harry, \"and nothing can vex him\r\nmore than to be told, what is literally the truth, that he resembles an\r\nEnglishman in many respects. I believe it is about the only thing that\r\n_can_ vex him. What an immovable man it is! I have seen a woman throw a\r\nlighted cigar into his face, and another cut off one end of his\r\nmoustache (that was when we were both younger, and used to see some\r\nqueer scenes abroad), and a servant drop half a tureen of soup over him,\r\nand none of these things stirred him. Once at Naples, I recollect, he\r\nset our chimney on fire. Such a time we had of it; every one in the\r\nhouse tumbling into our room, from the _piccolo_, with no coat and half\r\na pair of pants, to the proprietor in his dressing-gown and\r\nspectacles--women calling on the Virgin, men running after water--and\r\nthere sat Frank, absolutely radiating off so much coolness, that he\r\nimparted a portion of it to me, and we sat through the scene as quietly\r\nas if they had only been laying the cloth for dinner. A rum pair they\r\nmust have thought us! The day before we had astonished the waiter by\r\nlighting brandy over a pudding. I suppose we left them under the\r\nimpression that the Anglo-Saxons had a propensity to set fire to every\r\nthing they came in contact with.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very odd that so many of your people should be afraid of\r\nresembling us, and take the French type for imitation in preference to\r\nthe English. The original feeling of gratitude to France for having\r\nassisted you in the war of independence, does not seem sufficient to\r\naccount for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not; for that feeling would naturally diminish in succeeding\r\ngenerations, whereas the Gallicism of our people is on the increase,--in\r\nfact its origin is of comparatively recent date. But we really _are_\r\nmore like the French in some senses. Politically the American is very\r\nAnglo-Saxon. So he is morally; but socially, so far as you can separate\r\nsociety from morals, he is very French. The Englishman's first idea of\r\nhis duty in society is non-interference; the Frenchman's and American's,\r\namusement. An Englishman does not think it his business to endeavor to\r\namuse the company in which he happens to be; an Englishwoman does not\r\nthink it her duty to make any attempt to entertain a man who is\r\nintroduced to her. A Frenchman will rather talk trash, _knowing that he\r\nis talking trash_, than remain silent and let others remain silent. So\r\nwill an American. But an Englishman, unless he is sure of saying\r\nsomething to the point, will hold his tongue. The imperturbable\r\nself-possession of the English gentleman is generally understood by us,\r\nany more than it is by the French. His minding his own business is\r\nattributed to selfish indifference. The picture that half our people\r\nform of an Englishman is, a heavy, awkward man, very badly dressed,\r\ncourageous, and full of learning; but devoid of all the arts and graces\r\nof life, and caring for nobody but himself. It is a great pity that\r\nthere is not a better understanding; but, unfortunately, the best\r\nEnglishmen who come here seldom stay long enough to be appreciated, and\r\nthe best Americans who go to England seldom stay there long enough to\r\nappreciate the country. Whenever an American chances to stay some years\r\namong you, he ends by liking England very much; but it is very seldom\r\nthat he has any provocation, unless compelled by business, to stay some\r\nyears, for acquaintances are harder to make in London than in any other\r\ncity, while it has less resources for a man without acquaintances than\r\nany other city--besides being so dear. But here come the ladies at last;\r\nnow for breakfast.\"\r\n\r\nBreakfast was the best managed meal at the Bath Hotel. The _table\r\nd'hote_ began at half past seven, but fresh relays of rolls and eggs,\r\nham, chops, and steaks, were always to be obtained until half-past ten\r\nor eleven by those who had interest with the waiters. After breakfast\r\nthe company went to work promenading. There was a very wide hall running\r\nthrough the hotel, and up and down this, and up and down the two\r\nbroadest sides of the portico, all the world walked--\"our set\" being\r\nconspicuous from the elegance of their morning costume. One side of the\r\nportico was devoted to the gentlemen and their cigars, and there\r\nAshburner and Benson took a turn, leaving with the ladies Le Roi and a\r\nsmall beau or two who had joined them. Suddenly Benson pressed his\r\nfriend's arm.\r\n\r\n\"Here comes _really_ 'one of the most remarkable men'--the very god of\r\nthe dance; behold Tom Edwards!\"\r\n\r\nAshburner beheld a little man, about five feet and a half high. If he\r\ncould have stood on his bushy black beard it would have lifted him full\r\nthree inches higher. Besides this beard he cherished a small moustache,\r\nvery elaborately curling-tongsed at the ends into the shape of half a\r\nlyre. Otherwise he had not much hair on his head, but what he had was\r\nvery carefully brushed. His features were delicate, and not without\r\nintelligence, but terribly worn by dissipation. To look at his figure,\r\nyou would take him for a boy of nineteen; to look at his face, for a man\r\nof thirty: he was, probably, about half way between the two ages. Every\r\nthing about him was wonderfully neat: a white coat and hat like\r\nBenson's; cream-colored waistcoat and pearl-colored trousers;\r\nmiraculously small feet in resplendent boots, looking more like a doll's\r\nextremities than a man's; a fresh kid glove on one of his little hands,\r\nand on the other a sapphire ring, so large that Ashburner wondered how\r\nthe little man could carry it, and thought that he should, like\r\nJuvenal's dandies, have kept a lighter article for summer wear. Then he\r\nhad a watch-chain of great balls of blue enamel, with about two pounds\r\nof chatelaine charms dependent therefrom; and delicate little enamelled\r\nstuds, with sleeve-buttons to match. Altogether he was a wonderful lion,\r\nconsidering his size. Even Benson had not the courage to stop and\r\nintroduce his friend until he passed the great dancer more than once, in\r\nsilent admiration, and with a respectful bow.\r\n\r\nAnd as they passed he detailed to Ashburner, with his usual biographical\r\naccuracy, the history of Tom Edwards, which he had begun in the\r\nstage-coach. Tom had been left in his infancy with a fortune and without\r\na father, to be brought up by relatives who had an unlucky preference of\r\nParisian to American life. Under their auspices and those of other\r\nMentors, whom he found in that gay capital, his progress was so rapid,\r\nthat at a very early age he was known as the banker of two or three\r\ndistinguished _lorettes_, and the pet pupil of the renowned Cellarius.\r\nIndeed, he had lived so much in the society of that gentleman and his\r\ndancing girls, that he took the latter for his standard of female\r\nsociety, and had a tendency to behave to all womankind as he behaved to\r\nthem. To married ladies he talked slightly refined _double-entendre_: to\r\nyoung ladies he found it safest to say very little, his business and\r\npleasure being to dance with them; if they did not dance, he gave them\r\nup for uncivilized beings, and troubled himself no further about them.\r\nOf old people of either sex he took no further notice than to order them\r\nout of the way when they impeded the polkers, or dance bodily over them\r\nwhen they disobeyed. Still it must be said, in justice to him, that\r\ndancing was not his sole and all-absorbing pursuit. Having an active\r\nturn of mind and body, he found leisure for many other profitable\r\namusements. He was fond of that noble animal, the horse, gambled\r\nhabitually, ate and drank luxuriously,--in short, burned his candle at a\r\ngood many ends: but the dance was, though not his sole, certainly his\r\nfavorite passion; and he was never supremely happy but when he had all\r\nthe chairs in the house arranged in a circle, and all the boys and women\r\nof \"our set\" going around them in the German cotillon, from noon to\r\nmidnight at a (so-called) _matinee_, or from midnight to daybreak at a\r\nball.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said Benson, \"I think my cousin Gerard must be up by this\r\ntime; he and Edwards are generally the last to come down to breakfast.\r\nPerhaps we shall find him at the ten-pin alley; I see the ladies are\r\nmoving that way.\"\r\n\r\nTo the ten-pin alley they went. Down stairs, men were playing, coat off\r\nand cigar in mouth; while others waited their turn, with feet\r\ndistributed in various directions. Above, all was decorum; the second\r\nstory being appropriated to the ladies and their cavaliers. And very\r\nfond of the game the ladies were, for it afforded them an opportunity of\r\nshowing off a handsome arm, and sometimes a neat ankle. Gerard was not\r\nthere; they had to wait some time for alleys: altogether Benson was a\r\nlittle bored, and whispered to his friend that he meant to console\r\nhimself by making a little sensation.\r\n\r\n\"By your play?\" asked Ashburner.\r\n\r\n\"No, but by taking off my coat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, really, considering the material of your coat, I think it might as\r\nwell be on as off. Surely you can't find it an impediment?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but I mean to take it off for fun,--just to give the people here\r\nsomething to talk about; they talk so much about so little. They will be\r\nsaying all over by to-morrow that Mr. Benson was in the ladies' room\r\nhalf undressed.\"\r\n\r\nAfter an hour's rolling they turned hotelwards again, and as they did so\r\na very spicy phaeton, with gray wheelers and black leaders, drove up to\r\nthe door. A tall, handsome man, handed out a rather pretty and very\r\nshowily-dressed little woman; and Ashburner recognized Gerard Ludlow.\r\n\r\nIt was not the first time he had seen Gerard. They had travelled half\r\nover Greece together, having accidentally fallen upon the same route. As\r\nthe Honorable Edward had all the national fear of compromising himself,\r\nand Gerard was as proud and reserved as any Englishman, they went on\r\ntogether for days without speaking, although the only Anglo-Saxons of\r\nthe party. At last, Ludlow having capsized, horse and all, on a\r\nparticularly bad road, Ashburner took the liberty of helping to pick him\r\nup, and then they became very good friends. Gerard was at that time in\r\nthe full flush of youth and beauty, and the lion of the Italian capital\r\nwhich he had made his headquarters, where it was currently reported that\r\na certain very desirable countess had made desperate love to him, and\r\nthat a rich nobleman (for there are _some_ rich noblemen still left on\r\nthe continent) had tried very hard to get the handsome foreigner for a\r\nson-in-law. Knowing this and some other similar stories about him,\r\nAshburner was a little curious to see Mrs. Ludlow, and confessed himself\r\nsomewhat disappointed in her; he found her rather pretty, and certainly\r\nnot stupid; lively and agreeable in her manners, like most of her\r\ncountrywomen; but by no means remarkably distinguished either for beauty\r\nor wit. Benson explained to him that his cousin \"had married for tin.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Ludlow always talked of his father as a rich man, and his family as\r\na small one. I should have supposed money about the last thing he would\r\nhave married for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he had prospects of the best; but he wanted ready money and a\r\nsettled income. He was on a small allowance; he knew the only way to get\r\na handsome one was to marry, and that the more money his wife brought,\r\nthe more his father would come down with. So as Miss Hammersley had\r\neight thousand a year, old Ludlow trebled it; and Gerard may build as\r\nmany phaetons as he likes. I don't mean to say that the match is an\r\nuncongenial one--they have many tastes alike; but I do mean to say that\r\nlove had nothing to do with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I used to think that in your unsophisticated Republican country,\r\npeople married out of pure love; but now it looks as if the\r\nfashionables, at least, marry for money about as often as we do.\"\r\n\r\n\"They don't marry for any thing else,\" replied Benson, using one of the\r\nslang phrases of the day.[26]\r\n\r\nWhile the two friends were gossiping, Sumner and Le Roi had carried off\r\nthe ladies; and an assemblage of juvenile beaux and young girls, and\r\nsome few of the younger married women, had extemporized a dance in the\r\nlargest of the public parlors, which they kept up till two o'clock, and\r\nthen vanished--to dress, as it appeared, for the three o'clock dinner.\r\nBenson's party had obtained their apartments at last,--a parlor and two\r\nbedrooms for the ladies on the first floor, and chambers for the three\r\nmen in the second story, of a recently built wing, popularly known as\r\n\"the Colony,\" where most of the gay bachelors, and not a few of the\r\nyoung married men, slept. At dinner the ladies presented themselves as\r\nmuch dressed as they could be without being _decolletees_; and the men\r\nhad doffed their grass-cloth or linen garments, and put on dress-coats,\r\nor, at least, black coats. Ashburner was a good-looking young man\r\nenough, and had sufficient vanity to take notice, in the course of the\r\nmorning, that he was an object of attention; at dinner many looks were\r\ndirected towards him, but with an expression of disappointment which he\r\ndid not exactly understand at the time, but afterwards learned the\r\nreason of from his friend. Though making no pretensions to the title of\r\nexquisite, he happened to have a very neat shooting-jacket,\r\nunexceptionable in material and fit; and \"our set,\" having approved of\r\nthis, were curious to see what sort of costume he would display at\r\ndinner. When, therefore, he came to table,\r\n\r\n    Avec les memes bas et la meme cravate,\r\n\r\nand the shooting-jacket unchanged, they were visibly disappointed.\r\nBenson, to keep him in countenance, had retained his white coat, on the\r\nplea of its being most wanted then, as they were in the hottest part of\r\nthe day, which excuse did not enable him to escape some hints from his\r\nsister-in-law, and a direct scolding from his wife.\r\n\r\nOur Englishman thought the dinner hardly worth so much dressing for. The\r\ndishes, so far as he had an opportunity of judging, were tolerably\r\ncooked; but their number was not at all proportionate to that of the\r\nguests; in short, it was a decided case of short commons, and the\r\nwaiters were scarce to match. There were but two parties well attended\r\nto. One was the family of an old gentleman from the South, who was part\r\nowner of the building, and who, besides this advantage, enjoyed the\r\nprivilege of letting his daughter monopolize the piano of the public\r\nparlor half the day, to sing Italian _arias_ shockingly out of tune,\r\nmuch to the disgust of the boarders generally, and especially of the\r\ndancing set, who were continually wanting the instrument themselves for\r\npolking purposes. The other was----the reporters of _The Sewer_; who had\r\na choice collection of dishes and waiters always at their command. To be\r\nsure they had their end of the table to themselves, too, for not a\r\nperson sat within three chairs of them on either side; but this they, no\r\ndoubt, accepted as a complimentary acknowledgment of their formidable\r\nreputation. Every one else was famished. The married women grumbled, and\r\nscolded their husbands--those convenient scapegoats of all\r\nresponsibility; the young ladies tried to look very sentimental, and\r\nabove all such vulgar anxiety as that of meat and drink, but only\r\nsucceeded in looking very cross; the men swore in various dialects at\r\nthe waiters whenever they could catch them flying, and the waiters being\r\nused to it didn't mind it; and Ashburner, as a recollection of a former\r\nconversation flitted across his mind, could not help letting off a _tu\r\nquoque_ at his friend.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Benson,\" quoth he, \"is this one of the hotels that are so much\r\nbetter than ours, and that our people ought to take a lesson from?\"\r\n\r\nHarry looked half-a-dozen bowie-knives at him. Besides the natural\r\nirritation produced by hunger, his wife and sister-in-law had been\r\nwhipping him over each other's shoulders for the last half-hour, and now\r\nthis last remark made him ready to boil over. For a few seconds his face\r\nwore an expression positively dangerous, but in another moment the\r\nridiculous side of the case struck him. With a good-humored laugh he\r\ncalled for some wine--the only thing one was sure to get, as it was an\r\nextra, and a pretty expensive one, too, on the hills--and they drowned\r\ntheir hunger in a bumper of tolerable champagne.\r\n\r\nThe fact was, that the Bath Hotel had been a most excellent house three\r\nor four summers previous, and the \"enterprising and gentlemanly\"\r\nlandlord (to borrow an American penny-a-liner's phrase) having made a\r\nfortune, as he deserved, had sold out his lease, with the good-will and\r\nfixtures of the establishment, to Mr. Grabster. The latter gentleman was\r\noriginally a respectable farmer and market-gardener in the vicinity of\r\nOldport; and having acquired by his business a fair sum of money, was\r\nlooking about for some speculation in which to invest it. He commenced\r\nhis new profession with tolerably good intentions, but having as much\r\nidea of keeping a hotel as he had of steering a frigate, and finding a\r\nbalance against him at the end of the first season from sheer\r\nmismanagement, he had been endeavoring ever since to make up for it by\r\nscrewing his guests in every way. People naturally began to complain.\r\nTwo courses were open to him--to improve his living, or to tip an editor\r\nto puff him. He deemed the latter course the cheaper, and bought _The\r\nSewer_, which, while uttering the most fulsome adulation of every thing\r\nconnected with the Bath Hotel, frightened the discontented into silence\r\nthrough dread of its abuse. Ludlow, and some of the other exclusives,\r\nhad, in the beginning of the present season, contrived a remedy, which,\r\nfor the time, was perfectly successful. They held a private interview\r\nwith the cook, and made up a weekly contribution for him, on condition\r\nof their having the best of every thing, and enough of it, for dinner;\r\nand the waiters were similarly retained. For a time this worked to a\r\nmarvel, and the subscribers were as well fed as they could desire. But\r\nthe other guests began to make an outcry against the aristocracy and\r\nexclusiveness of private dishes on a public table, and the servants soon\r\nhit upon a compromise of their own, which was to take the money without\r\nrendering the _quid pro quo_. This, of course, soon put an end to the\r\npayments, and things were on the old starvation footing again.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, every body who had horses rode or drove. The roads about\r\nOldport were heavy and sandy, and terrible work the dust made with the\r\nladies' fine dresses and the gentlemen's fine coats.\r\n\r\n\"Rather different from the drives about Baden-Baden,\" said Benson.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but I suppose we must console ourselves on moral grounds, and\r\nremember, that there we owe the beautiful promenades to the\r\ngambling-table, while here we are without the roads, and also without\r\nthe play.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but isn't there play here! only all _sub rosa_. Wait a while, and\r\nyou'll find out.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Ashburner did find out before many nights, when the footsteps and\r\noaths of the young gamblers returning at four in the morning to their\r\nrooms in the \"Colony,\" woke him out of his first sleep. After the drive,\r\ntea--still at the _table-d'hote_--and after tea, dressing for the ball,\r\nwhich this night was at the Bellevue House, appropriately so called from\r\ncommanding a fine view of nothing. As the Bellevue was not a fashionable\r\nhotel (although the guests were sufficiently fed there), some of the\r\nexclusive ladies had hesitated about \"assisting\" on the occasion; but\r\nthe temptation of a dance was too strong to be resisted, and they all\r\nultimately went. Le Roi accompanied the Bensons in the all-accommodating\r\nRockaway. The Bellevue had a \"colony,\" too, in the second story of which\r\nwas the ballroom. As they ascended the stairs, the lively notes of _La\r\nPolka Sempiternelle, composee par Josef Bungel, et dediee a M. T.\r\nEdwards_, reached their ears; and hardly were they over the threshold\r\nwhen Edwards himself hopped up before them, and without other preface or\r\nsalutation than a familiar nod, threw his arm round Mrs. Benson's waist,\r\nand swung her off in the dance; while Sumner, who had simultaneously\r\npresented himself to Miss Vanderlyn, took similar possession of her.\r\n\r\n\"Do you dance?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I thank you.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Benson asked the question, Le Roi dived at a girl and whirled her\r\naway: almost before Ashburner had answered it, his friend shot away from\r\nhim, making point at a young married lady in the distance; and his bow\r\nof recognition ended in the back-step of the polka, as the two went off\r\ntogether at a killing pace. In five seconds from the time of entrance,\r\nAshburner was left standing alone at one end of the room, and his\r\ncompanions were twirling at the other. For so habituated were the\r\ndancers to their fascinating exercise, that they were always ready to go\r\nat the word, like trained horses. And certainly the dancing was\r\nbeautiful. He had never seen gentlemen move so gracefully and\r\ndexterously in a crowded room as these young Americans did. Le Roi and\r\nRoewenberg, who, by virtue of their respective nationalities, were bound\r\nto be good dancers, looked positively awkward alongside of the natives.\r\nAs to the ladies, they glided, and swam, and realized all the\r\nso-often-talked-of-and-seldom-seen \"poetry of motion.\" Indeed Ashburner\r\nthought they did it too well. He thought of Catiline's friend,\r\ncommemorated by Sallust, who \"danced better than became a modest woman.\"\r\nHe thought some of their displays were a little operatic, and that he\r\nhad seen something like them at certain balls in Paris--_not_ the balls\r\nof the Faubourg St. Germain. He thought that the historian's aphorism\r\nmight be extended to the male part of the company,--and that they danced\r\nbetter than became intelligent men. He thought--but as he prudently kept\r\nthoughts to himself, and as some of his foreign prejudice may have been\r\nat the bottom of them, we will not stop to record them all. By and by\r\nthere was a quadrille for the benefit of the million, during which the\r\nexclusives rested, and Ashburner had full opportunity of observing them.\r\nThe first thing that struck him was the extreme youth of the whole set,\r\nand more especially of the masculine portion of it. Old men there were\r\nnone. The old women, that is to say, the mammas and aunts, were stuck\r\ninto corners out of the way, and no one took any notice of them.\r\nHamilton White was quite an old beau by comparison--almost\r\nsuperannuated. Sumner would have been nearly off the books but for his\r\nvery superior dancing. Even Benson seemed a middle-aged man compared\r\nwith the majority of \"our set,\" who averaged between boys of seventeen\r\nand young men of twenty-four. And the more juvenile the youth, the\r\nlarger and stiffer was his white tie. Some of these neck-fastenings were\r\nterrific to behold, standing out a foot on each side of the wearer. All\r\nthe Joinvilles that Ashburner had ever seen, on all the gents in London\r\nor elsewhere, faded into insignificance before these portentous cravats.\r\nHe could not help making some observations on this fashion to Benson, as\r\nhe encountered him promenading with a fair _polkiste_.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever notice the whiffletrees of my team-trotting wagon, how\r\nthey extend on each side beyond the hubs of the wheels? They serve for\r\nfeelers in a tight place: wherever you clear your whiffletrees, you can\r\nclear your wheels; and these cravats are built on the same\r\nprinciple--wherever you clear your tie, you can clear your partner.\"\r\n\r\nBy one in the morning the democracy of the ballroom had had enough of\r\nfour hours' dancing and looking on. \"Our set\" was left in full\r\npossession of the floor. Forthwith they seized upon all the chairs, and\r\nthe interminable German cotillon commenced. It lasted two hours--and how\r\nmuch longer Ashburner could not tell. When he went away at three, the\r\ndancers looked very deliquescent, but gave no symptoms of flagging. And\r\nso ended his first day's experience of an American watering-place.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[26] This is the strongest American (slang) way of putting an\r\naffirmation; and, probably, the strongest instance of it on record is\r\nthat of a Bowery boy, who, when asked by a clergyman, \"Wilt thou have\r\nthis woman?\" replied, \"I won't have any one else.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From the Dublin University Magazine.]\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTIC VIAL:\r\n\r\nOR,\r\n\r\nTHE LAST DEMOISELLE DE CHARREBOURG.\r\n\r\n_Continued from page 75._\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nVI.--THE MINIATURE.\r\n\r\nLucille had not, therefore, gained by her marriage the position to which\r\nher ambition aspired. She had made several ineffectual efforts to\r\ndissolve the spell of isolation which seemed to seclude the intercourse\r\nof the Chateau des Anges from all human ken and visitation as absolutely\r\nas the palace of a merman. With the exception, however, of a few visits\r\nfrom the great ladies who resided in the neighborhood, no casual beams\r\nfrom the brilliant world of rank and fashion without penetrated the\r\ndismal shadows of her gorgeous abode.\r\n\r\nShe was dissatisfied, angry, and resolved upon the earliest fitting\r\noccasion to rebel against the selfish tyranny which consigned her to\r\nsolitude and monotony.\r\n\r\nShe had hitherto gained nothing by those little expedients, hints, and\r\neven entreaties, which are sometimes found so effectual in like cases.\r\nThe old fermier-general was just as smiling and as promising as the\r\nChateau des Anges itself, but, alas! as absolutely impenetrable. An iron\r\nwill encountered and repressed all her shifts and struggles. She chafed\r\nand coaxed alike in vain. Whether the bird sang or fluttered, the bars\r\nof her cage were immovable.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, no very cordial feelings began to animate the\r\nfiery girl respecting her resolute and reserved old helpmate.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the humble cottage in the park of Charrebourg was deserted,\r\nand permitted to fall to decay, for the old visconte, and even\r\nMarguerite, had been removed to the establishment at Des Anges, and so,\r\nin process of time, the little walks were overgrown with grass, the\r\nfences spread and straggled, dark green plants clambered to the roof,\r\nand weeds showed themselves over the tiled vestibule and even ventured\r\ninto the inner chambers. Thus time and nature, in mournful alliance,\r\nbegan their obliterating work. But there were some plants and flowers\r\nwhich grew outside what had been for so long Mademoiselle Lucille de\r\nCharrebourg's window. They had been the objects of her care, and\r\nGabriel!--sweet but sorrowful remembrance!--had been, in those happy\r\ntimes, privileged to tend them for her. Poor Gabriel was now desolate\r\nindeed, but he pleased himself with dressing those flowers, and\r\nwatering, and weeding them day by day, just as if she were there; and he\r\nwould then sit on the bank that bounded the bowling-green, and watch the\r\ndesolate casement where he used so often to see that face that too\r\nprobably was never more to beam on him. And thus hours would glide away,\r\nand, young as he was, he came to live chiefly in the past.\r\n\r\nAnd generally when he rose, and with an effort, and many a backward\r\nlook, lingeringly departed, he would strengthen his sinking heart with\r\nsome such reflection as this:--\r\n\r\n\"She did not love the fermier-general--it was the visconte who made her\r\nmarry him. This Monsieur Le Prun--what was he at first but a\r\nroturier--no better than myself--and made his own money--fortune may yet\r\nbefriend me also. I have energies, and resolution, and courage, for her\r\nsake, to dare ten thousand deaths. I'll not despair. And then the old\r\nfellow can't live _very_ long--a few years--and so who knows yet what\r\nmay befall?\"\r\n\r\nThere was one beautiful rose which grew close to the window, and which\r\nLucille herself had planted, and this tree Gabriel came gradually to\r\nregard as connected by some sweet and silent sympathy with the features\r\nand feelings of its mistress. When it drooped, she, he thought, was sick\r\nor in sorrow; when, on the contrary, it was covered with blossoms and\r\nfresh leaves, she was full of smiles and health; when a rough gust tore\r\nits slender sprays, some vexation and disappointment had fretted her;\r\nand when again it put forth new buds and sprouts, these were forgotten,\r\nand time had gathered round her new hopes and delights. Thus this tree\r\nbecame to him an object of strangely tender interest, and he cherished\r\nthe fancy that, in tending and guarding it, he was protecting the\r\nfortunes and the happiness of poor Lucille.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as a sort of beginning of that great fortune that awaited\r\nhim, he obtained employment as an under-gardener at the Chateau de\r\nCharrebourg, which had just been let to a wealthy noble, whose millions\r\nhad elevated him (like Monsieur le Prun) from the bourgeoisie to his\r\npresent rank.\r\n\r\nBut we must return to the Chateau des Anges. Lucille's apartments were\r\nsituated at a side of the chateau overlooking a small court\r\ncommunicating with the greater one at the front of the building; and\r\nthis narrow area was bounded by a lofty wall, which separated the other\r\npleasure-grounds from the park.\r\n\r\nIt was night; Lucille and her gentle companion, Julie, had been chatting\r\ntogether, as young-lady friends will do, most confidentially. The little\r\nmaiden had detailed all her sadness and alarms. Her married companion\r\nhad been fluent and indignant upon her wrongs and disappointments. Each\r\nfelt a sort of relief, and drawn as it were into a securer intimacy, by\r\nthe absence of Monsieur le Prun, who was that night necessarily absent\r\nupon business.\r\n\r\nThe conversation had now shifted to Julie's engagement.\r\n\r\n\"And so, I suppose, I must marry him. Is it not a cruel tyranny to\r\ncompel one who desires nothing but to live and die among good\r\nChristians, in the quiet of a convent, to marry a person whom she does\r\nnot or cannot love?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Julie, so it seems; but you may yet be happier so married, than\r\nleading the life you long for. Remember, Julie, he is not a man who has\r\noutlived the warmth, and tenderness, and trust of youth. He is still\r\ncapable of a generous passion, and capable of inspiring one. There is no\r\ngrief like the tyranny of one whom law and not love has made your\r\nmaster.\"\r\n\r\nAs they conversed, some cases of Lucille's lay open on the table before\r\nher companion, who had been amusing herself in girlish fashion by the\r\nvaried splendor and exquisite taste of the jewelry they contained.\r\n\r\n\"This brooch,\" she said, taking up a miniature in enamel, representing\r\nsome youthful tradition of Monsieur le Prun's person, set round with\r\ndiamonds, \"is set very like mine, but I hate to look at it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It represents, then----\"\r\n\r\n\"The Marquis. Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"The world calls him handsome, I am told.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but somehow, if he be so, I can't perceive it; he does not please\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, bring me the miniature, and I will pronounce between you\r\nand the world.\"\r\n\r\nWith a melancholy smile Julie ran to her own apartment, hard by, and in\r\na few minutes returned. With curiosity all alive, Lucille took the\r\nbrooch and looked at it.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what say you?\" asked Julie, who stood behind her chair, gazing at\r\nthe trinket over her shoulder. Lucille was silent, although nearly a\r\nminute had elapsed.\r\n\r\n\"He certainly has the noble air,\" she continued; but still Lucille\r\noffered no criticism.\r\n\r\nOn a sudden she put down the miniature sharply on the table, and said,\r\nabruptly, \"It is time to go to rest; let us go to bed.\"\r\n\r\nShe rose and turned full round on Julie as she spoke. Her face was pale\r\nas death, and her eyes looked large and gleaming. Her gaze was almost\r\nwild.\r\n\r\n\"Are you ill?\" said Julie, frightened, and taking her hand, which was\r\nquite cold.\r\n\r\n\"O, no, no,\" said Lucille quickly, with a smile that made her pallor and\r\nher dilated stare more shocking. \"No, no, no--tired, vexed, heart-sick\r\nof the world and of my fate.\"\r\n\r\nJulie, though shocked and horrified, thought she had never seen Lucille\r\nlook so handsome before. She was an apparition terrible, yet beautiful\r\nas a lost angel.\r\n\r\n\"You are, after all, right,\" she said suddenly. \"I--I believe I _am_\r\nill.\"\r\n\r\nThe windows of the apartment descended to the floor, and opened upon a\r\nbalcony. She pushed the casement apart, and stood in the open air. Julie\r\nhad hurried to her assistance, fearing she knew not what, and stood\r\nclose by her. Never was scene so fitted to soothe the sick brain, and\r\ncharm the senses with its sad and sweet repose. The pure moon, high in\r\nthe deep blue of the heavens, shed over long rows of shimmering steps,\r\nand urns, and marble images--over undulating woodlands, and sheets of\r\nembowered and sleeping water, and distant hills, a mournful and airy\r\nsplendor.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as though nature were doing homage to so much beauty. The old\r\nforest wafted from his broad bosom a long hushed sigh as she came forth;\r\nthe moon looked down on her with a serene, sad smile; and the spirits of\r\nthe night-breeze sported with her tresses, and kissed her pale lips and\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\nAt least five minutes passed in silence. Lucille, on a sudden, said--\r\n\r\n\"So, at the end of a year you will be married?\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Julie that the countenance that was turned upon her gleamed\r\nwith an expression of hatred which froze her. But the moonlight is\r\nuncertain, and may play wild freaks with the character of an excited\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear Lucille; alas! yes,\" she answered, in a tone that was almost\r\ndeprecatory.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, I am better now,\" she said, after a second interval. \"My\r\nhead, Julie--my poor head!\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you a pain there, dear Lucille?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, it's all there,\" she said, abstractedly; and, returning, she\r\nkissed her gentle companion, bade her good night, and was alone.\r\n\r\nJulie was strangely perplexed by the scene which had just occurred. She\r\ncould account for it upon no theory but the supposition that some\r\nflickering vein of insanity was shooting athwart her reason, and as\r\nsuddenly disappeared. As soon as she was partially composed, she kneeled\r\ndown at the bedside, and prayed long and fervently; and for far the\r\ngreater part of the time poor Lucille was the sole theme of her\r\nsupplications. At last she lay down, and composed herself to sleep.\r\nSpite of the unpleasant images with which her mind was filled, slumber\r\nere long overpowered her. But these painful impressions made teasing and\r\nfantastic shapes to themselves. Her pillow was haunted, and strange\r\ndreams troubled her slumbering senses. From one of these visions she\r\nawoke with a start, and found herself sitting upright in her bed, with\r\nher heart beating fast with terror. A burst of passionate wailing from\r\nLucille's apartments thrilled her with a sort of terror at the same\r\nmoment. In hushed uncertainty she listened for a repetition of the\r\nsound; but in vain. She was prompted to go and try whether she needed\r\nany help or comfort; but something again withheld her; and, after\r\nanother interval of somewhat excited reflection, she once more gradually\r\nfell asleep. Again, however, hateful visions tormented her. She dreamed\r\nthat a phantom, said to have haunted the chateau for ages, and known by\r\nthe familiar title of \"La Belle Colombe,\" was pursuing her from chamber\r\nto chamber, dressed in her accustomed shroud of white; and had at last\r\nsucceeded in chasing her into a chamber from which there was no second\r\ndoor of escape--when she awoke with a start; and, behold! there was a\r\nlight in the room, and a female form, dressed in white, standing between\r\nthe bedside and the door. For some moments she fancied that she saw but\r\nthe continuation of her dream, and awaited the further movements of the\r\nfigure with the fascination of terror. But gradually her senses reported\r\nmore truly, and she perceived that the figure in white was indeed\r\nLucille--pale, haggard; while with one she held the candlestick, with\r\nthe other she motioned slowly towards the bed, which she was approaching\r\nwith breathless caution, upon tiptoe. With an effort Julie succeeded in\r\ncalling her by name, almost expecting as she did so to see the whole\r\napparition vanish into air.\r\n\r\n\"Awake, awake; how softly you breathe, Julie!\" said Lucille, drawing\r\nclose to the bedside, and drawing the curtains.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear Lucille; can I do any thing for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no--nothing but----\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you feel now?--are you better?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, better than I desire to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why are you here, dear Lucille? Has any thing--_frightened_ you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! then you heard it, did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Heard it? What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, how long have you been awake--did you--did you hear\r\nmusic--singing?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no; but in truth, dear Lucille, I thought I heard you weeping.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, nonsense; who minds a girl's weeping. But you heard nothing else?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed.\"\r\n\r\nLucille appeared greatly relieved by this assurance. She stooped over\r\nher and kissed her; and it was not until her face was thus brought near\r\nthat Julie could perceive how worn and wan with weeping it was.\r\n\r\n\"I have been dreaming, then; yes, yes, I suspected as much--_dreaming_,\"\r\nshe said; and, as she reached her own room, she muttered--\r\n\r\n\"Well, God be thanked, she did _not_ hear it. But what can it mean? What\r\nmadness and crime can have conjured up these sounds? What can it mean\r\nbut guilt, danger, and despair?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.--THE DEVIL'S COACH.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Julie that Lucille was moody and abstracted next morning.\r\nSometimes for a few moments she talked and smiled as before, but this\r\nwas fitfully, and with an effort. She appeared like one brooding over\r\nsome wrong that had taken possession of her thoughts, or some dark and\r\nangry scheme which engrossed her imagination. She soon left Julie and\r\nretired to her own apartments.\r\n\r\nWhen Monsieur Le Prun returned, some time after noon, not finding his\r\nyoung wife in her usual chamber, he went up stairs to wish her good day\r\nin her own suite of rooms.\r\n\r\nHe was surprised at the sullen and stormy countenance with which she\r\ngreeted him. She had not yet ventured to rebel against his authority,\r\nalthough she had frequently hinted her remonstrances and wrongs. But\r\nthere was now a darkness charged with thunder on her brow, and the\r\nfermier-general began seriously (in nautical phrase) to look out for\r\nsqualls.\r\n\r\n\"Good-day, my pretty wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-day, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you well to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey? that's a pity; what ails you, my charming little wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"Solitude.\"\r\n\r\n\"Solitude! pooh, pooh! why, there is Julie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Julie has her _young_ lover to think of.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when you weary of her,\" he continued, resolved not to perceive the\r\nslight but malicious emphasis, \"you have got your own sweet thoughts to\r\nretire upon.\"\r\n\r\n\"My thoughts are ill company, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, as it seems to me, the pretty child is out of temper to-day,\" he\r\nsaid, with evident chagrin.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I am--it is natural--I should be a fool were I otherwise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Par bleu! what new calamity is this?\" he asked, with a smile and a\r\nshrug.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing new, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what _old_ calamity?\"\r\n\r\nThe past night had wrought a change in Lucille; and, little as she had\r\never liked M. Le Prun, she now felt a positive hatred of him, and she\r\nanswered with a gloomy sort of recklessness--\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I am a prisoner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tut, tut! pretty rogue.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a prisoner; _your_ prisoner.\"\r\n\r\n\"A prisoner on parole, perhaps; but provided, pretty captive, you don't\r\ndesert me, you may wander where you will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw! that is nonsense,\" she said sharply.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" he repeated, testily; \"it is no such thing, madame; you have\r\nthe handsomest equipages in France. Pray, when did I refuse you\r\ncarriages, or horses, or free egress from this place? par bleu! or lock\r\nthe gates, madame? Treated as you are, how _can_ you call yourself a\r\nprisoner?\"\r\n\r\n\"What advantage in carriages, and horses, and open gates, when we are\r\nsurrounded by a desert?\"\r\n\r\n\"A desert? what do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is not a soul to speak to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a soul--why, you are jesting; pray, is the Marquise de Pompignaud\r\nnobody? is the Conte de la Perriere nobody?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Worse_ than nobody, monsieur: I should prefer a desert to a wilderness\r\nhaunted by such creatures.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Sacre!_ what does the child want?\"\r\n\r\n\"What every wife in France commands--society, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I say you have got it: independently of your immediate domestic\r\ncircle, you have a neighborhood such as ought to satisfy any reasonable\r\nperson. There are persons fully as well descended as yourself, and\r\nothers nearly as rich as I am, all within easy visiting distance.\"\r\n\r\n\"The rich are all plebeians, and the nobles are all poor; there is and\r\ncan be in a group so incongruous no cordiality, no gayety, no splendor;\r\nin a word, no such society as the last descendant of the Charrebourgs\r\nmay reasonably aspire to.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is fully as numerous and respectable, notwithstanding, as the\r\nsociety which the last descendant of the Charrebourgs enjoyed in the\r\nancestral park where first I had the honor of making her acquaintance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but not such as with my birth and beauty I might and _must_ have\r\ncommanded, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do you expect? These people won't give fetes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bring me to Paris, sir; I wish to take my place among the noble\r\nsociety, where I may meet my equals; and at court, where I may, like all\r\nmy ancestry, see my sovereign. Here, sir, my days fly by in melancholy\r\nisolation; I am kept but to amuse your leisure; this, sir, is not\r\nindulgence--it is selfish and tyrannical.\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur Le Prun looked angrier and uglier than ever she had seen him\r\nbefore. His eyes looked more black and prominent, and his face a great\r\ndeal paler. But he did not trust himself with an immediate answer; and\r\nhis features, as if in the effort to restrain the retort his anger\r\nprompted, underwent several grotesque and somewhat ghastly contortions.\r\n\r\nHis handsome wife, meanwhile, sat sullen and defiant, daring, rather\r\nthan deprecating, the menaced explosion of his wrath.\r\n\r\nTheir matrimonial bickerings, however, were not so soon to reach their\r\nclimax. Monsieur Le Prun contrived to maintain a silent\r\nself-command--thrust his hands into his pockets, walked to the window\r\nhumming an air, and after a few moments' pause, turned abruptly and left\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nNear the stair-head he met old Marguerite on her way to Lucille's\r\napartments. He signed to her to follow him, and entered a chamber there.\r\nShe perceived the unmistakable traces of angry excitement in his\r\nface--always sinister in an old man, but in one so powerful, and about\r\nwhom she had heard so many dark rumors, full of vague terrors. As soon\r\nas he had closed the door, he said to her--\r\n\r\n\"I hope they make you comfortable here, Marguerite?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, very comfortable,\" she replied, with a low courtesy, and\r\ntrembling a good deal.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Marguerite, I suppose you would wish to make a suitable return.\r\nNow, some vile miscreant meddler, who has got the ear of your young\r\nmistress, has been endeavoring to make her unhappy in her present\r\nsecluded situation--I think I could place my hand upon the culprit; but\r\nat all events, do _you_ lose no opportunity henceforward of cheering\r\nher, and reconciling your young mistress, to this most suitable\r\nresidence.\"\r\n\r\nIt was perfectly plain from his looks, that Monsieur Le Prun suspected\r\n_her_ of being the \"meddler\" in question; but before she could muster\r\npresence of mind to attempt her exculpation, he was gone. The interview\r\nwas like an ugly, flitting dream. His angry face and menacing croak had\r\nscared her senses but for a moment; the apparition had vanished, and,\r\nwith a heart still beating fast, she went stealthily on her way.\r\n\r\nNow Julie perceived that a change had taken place in Lucille--she was\r\nanxious and excited, and appeared morbidly and passionately eager to\r\nshare in those amusements which before she had desired with comparative\r\nmoderation.\r\n\r\n\"Julie, I _will_ mix in the world; I _will_ meet people and associate\r\nwith my equals--I am resolved upon it. If Monsieur Le Prun persists in\r\nrefusing my reasonable wishes, it will perchance be the worse for\r\nhimself.\"\r\n\r\nSuch sentences she used to utter amidst blushes and pallor, and with a\r\nfire and agitation that painfully perplexed her gentle, but now somewhat\r\nestranged, little companion.\r\n\r\nHer conduct, too, became eccentric and capricious; sometimes she\r\nappeared sullen and reserved--sometimes, at moments, as if animated with\r\na positive hatred of her unoffending companion. Then, again, she would\r\nrelent, and, in an agony of compunction, entreat her to be reconciled.\r\n\r\nIt happened, not unfrequently, that business compelled Monsieur Le Prun\r\nto pass the night from home. Upon one of these occasions Lucille had\r\ngone early to her bed, and old Marguerite, at her special desire, sat\r\nbeside her.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Marguerite,\" said her young mistress, \"I am going to exact the\r\nfulfilment of a promise you made me long ago, when first you came home,\r\nand before you became afraid of Monsieur Le Prun. You told me, then,\r\nthat you knew some stories of him--come, what are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey dear, bless the pretty child!--did I though?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, Marguerite; and you must tell them now--I say you _must_--I\r\n_will_ have them. Nay, don't be afraid; I'll not tell them again, and\r\nnobody can overhear us here.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my pretty pet, these stories----\"\r\n\r\n\"Then there _are_ stories--see, you can't deny it any longer; tell them,\r\ntell them to me all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, they are nothing but a pack of nonsense. You would laugh at me. It\r\nis only about monsieur's father, and the wonderful coach they say he\r\nleft to his son.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, be it what it may, let me have it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, my pretty bird, you shall have it as they told it to\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked into the next apartment, and having satisfied herself that\r\nit was vacant, and shut the door of communication, she prepared for her\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\nWe have clipped the redundancies and mended the inaccuracies of honest\r\nMarguerite's phraseology; but the substance and arrangement of the story\r\nis recorded precisely as she gave it herself.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur's father, they say, began with a very little money, madame,\r\nand he made it more by--by--in short, by _usury_; I beg pardon, but they\r\nsay so, madame; and so finding as he grew old that he had a great deal\r\nof gold, and wishing to have some one of his own flesh and blood to\r\nleave it to, when he should be dead and buried, he bethought him of\r\ngetting a wife. He must have been a shrewd man, I need not tell you, to\r\nhave made so much money, so he was determined not to make his choice\r\nwithout due consideration. Now there was a farmer near them, who had a\r\npretty and innocent daughter, and after much cautious inquiry and\r\npatient study of her character, old money-bags resolved that she was\r\nexcellently suited for his purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"She was young and pretty, and he old and ugly, but rich; well, what\r\nfollowed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, she, poor thing, did not want to marry him at all; for though he\r\nwas rich, he had a very ill name in the country, and she was afraid of\r\nhim; but her father urged her, and the old man himself spoke her fair,\r\nand between them they overpowered her fears and scruples, and so she was\r\nmarried.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor thing!\" said Lucille, unconsciously.\r\n\r\n\"Well, madame, he married, and brought her home to his desolate old\r\nhouse, and there, they say, he treated her harshly; and, indeed he might\r\nthere safely use her as he pleased, for there was not another house for\r\na great way round to be seen: and nobody but his own creatures and\r\ndependents, who, they said, were just as bad as himself, could hear her\r\ncries, or witness his barbarities.\"\r\n\r\nLucille sat up in the bed, and listened with increased interest.\r\n\r\n\"Poor thing! it was there, in the midst of sufferings and cruelties,\r\nthat she gave birth to a child, who is now Monsieur Le Prun, the great\r\nfermier-general; but her health, and indeed her heart, was broken; and,\r\nsome rumor having reached her relations, that she was sick and unhappy,\r\na cousin of hers, who, they said, was in love with her in their early\r\ndays, brought the village physician with him to see her, though it was\r\nfull three leagues and a half away.\"\r\n\r\n\"The cousin loved her; poor fellow, he was true,\" said Lucille, with a\r\nblush of interest.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, so they say; but Monsieur Le Prun, who was a jealous curmudgeon,\r\nwould not admit him; but he did allow the physician to see her (himself\r\nstanding by), because he was always glad to have the use of any body's\r\nskill for nothing--which, more than any love he bore his poor wife, was\r\nthe reason of his letting him prescribe for her. Well, of course, she\r\ncould not send any message to her friends, nor tell how she was treated,\r\nfor old Le Prun was at her bedside; but the physician saw that she was\r\nill, and he said to the old miser--'Your wife can't walk, and she must\r\nhave air; let her drive every day in your coach.' 'I have no such\r\nthing,' said old Le Prun. 'But you are rich,' said the physician, 'you\r\ncan afford to buy one; and it is your duty to do so for your wife, who\r\nwill die else.' 'Let her die, then, for me--the devil may send her a\r\ncoach to ride in, as they say he sent me my money; but I'll not waste my\r\ngold on any such follies.' So the physician went away, disappointed and\r\ndisgusted, and her poor cousin was not able to effect any good on her\r\nbehalf; but it seems the words of Monsieur Le Prun did not fall quite to\r\nthe ground--they were heard in the quarter to where they were directed.\r\nThat evening closed in clouds, and before twelve o'clock at night, they\r\nsay, there came on such another thunder-storm as never was heard in the\r\nneighborhood, before or since. Nothing but thunder, roaring and\r\ncrashing, peal upon peal, till the old house shook and trembled to its\r\nvery base; and the blue lightning glared at every window, and split\r\nalong the pavement in streams of livid fire; and all this time the rain\r\nwas beating straight down in an incessant and furious deluge.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so, I suppose, the devil came in the midst of the tempest, and took\r\nhim away bodily in a flash of lightning?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, my pretty bird, not so fast. There was an old negro servant of\r\nhis, a fellow just as wicked as himself, who was sitting in the kitchen,\r\ncursing the rain that was battering in huge drops down the chimney, and\r\nputting out the wood at which he was warming his shins, when, in the\r\nmidst of the dreadful hubbub of the tempest, what should he hear but the\r\nrush of a great equipage, and wheels and horses clattering over the\r\npavement, amidst the shouts of men and the sound of horns. Up jumped the\r\nblack, and, listening, he heard a loud voice shouting through the storm,\r\nas if to summon some one to the door. Though they say he was a\r\ncourageous old sinner, his heart failed him, for such sounds had not\r\nvisited the old house within the memory of man in the day time, much\r\nless in the dead of night; and, instead of going to the door, he hurried\r\naway to the chamber where old Le Prun was cowering, screwed up in the\r\nmiddle of a great old fauteuil, and more frightened at the tempest than\r\nhe would have cared to confess. So he told him of the sounds he had just\r\nheard, and he and his master mounted together to a small room in a gable\r\nover the hall-door, and from the casement of this they commanded a view\r\nof the paved court in front. It was so dark, however, that they could\r\nsee nothing; and the thunder still echoing in loud explosions, and the\r\nrain battering at the windows, prevented their distinctly hearing the\r\nwords which the voice was shouting outside. 'Shall we open the casement\r\nand ask him what they want?' said the old negro. 'Let it alone,' said\r\nhis old master, shoving his arm back again, with a curse. At the same\r\nmoment a vivid flash of lightning, or rather several in almost\r\ncontinuous succession, shed for some seconds a blue, pulsating\r\nillumination over the scene, and then they saw before their eyes a\r\ncoach, with a team of horses and outriders, in the style of a royal\r\nequipage, drawn up before the hall door; and all the postillions and\r\noutriders were sitting motionless, with their whips pointing to the\r\nhouse, as if they were signing to the inhabitants to come out: and some\r\none was looking from the window, and cried, in a tone like the shriek of\r\nthe wind--'The coach that Monsieur Le Prun ordered this morning.' In the\r\nquivering blue light the whole thing looked like a smoky shadow, and was\r\nswallowed in darkness in a moment. Then came the bellowing\r\nthunder-burst, and a wild scream of winds rushed whooping, and sighing,\r\nand hissing through the tree-tops, and died away in the unknown\r\ndistance. The two old sinners, master and man, crept away from the\r\nwindow, and stumbled their way back again to the chamber which Monsieur\r\nLe Prun had occupied before, and which, being in the rear of the house,\r\nand most remote from the sight that had scared them, was preferred by\r\nthem to any other. In the morning a coach, of first-rate workmanship in\r\nall respects, was standing in front of the hall door, just where they\r\nhad seen it on the night before, but no sign of horse, rider, or owner.\r\nFor several days it remained in the same position, no one caring to\r\ntouch it; but at the end of that time, having grown accustomed to its\r\npresence, and gradually less and less in awe of it, they lodged it in\r\nthe coach-house; and so, after a considerable time, the old usurer's\r\ninstincts prevailed, and he resolved to make trial of the vehicle, with\r\na view to sell it in Paris. At first the horses snorted, and reared, and\r\nshyed, when they were attempted to be harnessed to it, but in a little\r\nwhile they too became reconciled to it, and Monsieur Le Prun made an\r\nexperimental trip in it himself. Whatever passed upon that occasion, it\r\ncertainly determined him against parting with it. And, it was said,\r\nwhenever he was thenceforward in doubt about any purchase, or meditating\r\nany important financial _coup_, he invariably took a solitary drive in\r\nthis preternaturally-acquired vehicle; and, in the course of that drive,\r\nhis doubts, whatever they may have been, were invariably resolved, and\r\nsome lucky purchase or successful operation upon 'Change was sure to\r\nfollow. It was said that upon these occasions Monsieur Le Prun was\r\nalways heard to converse with some companion in the coach; and the\r\ndriver once avowed that, having been delayed by an accident on the road,\r\nas the darkness came on, he distinctly saw two shadowy outriders\r\nspurring duly in their van, and never lost sight of them until, with\r\nhair standing on end, and bathed in a cold sweat, he drew up in the\r\ncourt before his master's house.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what happened to old Le Prun?\"\r\n\r\n\"When they returned from one of their drives, taken, Heaven bless us!\r\nfor the purpose of consulting the Evil One, so to speak, face to face,\r\nthey found old Le Prun quite dead, sitting back in his wonted attitude,\r\nand with his arm slung in the embroidered strap.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what has become of the wonderful coach?\"\r\n\r\n\"That I have never heard; but they say that Monsieur Le Prun, the\r\nfermier-general, has it in one of his houses, either in the country or\r\nin Paris, and that, whenever he wants to consult the familiar demon of\r\nthe family, he takes a drive in it alone; and this, they say, has been\r\nthe cause of his great successes and his enormous fortune.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like to ride in that coach myself,\" said Lucille.\r\n\r\n\"Heaven and all the saints forbid!\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to know my destiny, Marguerite. Were I sure that all my days\r\nwere to pass as at present, I would rather die than live.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but sure my pretty bird would not ask her fortune of--of--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of any one--of any spirit, good or evil, that could tell it. I am\r\nweary of my life, Marguerite. I would rather beg or work with my\r\nliberty, and the friends I like, than see my days glide by in this dull,\r\nwealthy house, without interest, or hope, or--or _love_.\"\r\n\r\n\"But never desire, while you live, my child, the visits of the Evil One.\r\nOnce asked for, it is said he never refuses them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say you so? then I invite him with all my heart,\" she said, with a\r\nbitter pleasantry; \"he can't be a great deal worse than the society I\r\nhave sometimes had to share; and, if he discloses the futurity that\r\nawaits me, he will have been the most instructive companion that fortune\r\never lent me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Chut! madame, listen.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter, Marguerite?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did not you hear?\"\r\n\r\n\"What?--whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"There--there again; blessed Virgin shield us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Psha! Marguerite; it is nothing but the moths flying against the\r\nwindow-panes; I have heard that little tapping a hundred times.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, maybe so; but say your prayers, my dear, and ask\r\nforgiveness for your foolish words.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Marguerite; for in truth I do wish my fortune were read to me, and\r\ncare not by whom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey, what's that? Chut! in Heaven's name hold thy mad tongue,\" she\r\ncried, in the irritation of panic; \"surely _that_ is no moth. May the\r\nsaints guard your bed, my child. You heard it, did you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hum--yes--there was a sound.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think so, par bleu! something a size or two larger than a\r\nmoth, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a spray of one of the plants swung by the breeze against the\r\nwindow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ma foi! it was no such thing, my sweet pet; no, no, something with a\r\npair of wings fluttered up against it.\"\r\n\r\nHad the old woman, in her trepidation, had leisure to study the\r\ncountenance of her young mistress, she would have perceived that her\r\ncheeks were flushed with crimson. But she was too busy with her medley\r\nof prayers and protestations, and too fully preoccupied with the idea of\r\nan unearthly visitation.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, Marguerite, be it as you say; I'll not dispute the point;\r\nbut leave me now; I'm tired, and would sleep. Good night.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the old woman had withdrawn some minutes, Lucille rose from her\r\nbed. She had only been partially undressed; and throwing on her\r\ndressing-gown, and putting her little ivory feet into her slippers, she\r\nglided to her chamber-door, which she secured, and then cautiously, and\r\nalmost fearfully, stepped to the window, which she pushed open, and\r\nstood upon the balcony.\r\n\r\nWith a beating heart, and a cheek that momentarily changed color, she\r\nlooked all along the edges of the court, and over the tall plants, and\r\nunder the shadow of the lofty jessamine-covered wall. She listened with\r\nbreathless and excited suspense--she waited for some minutes; but,\r\nhaving watched and listened in vain, she pressed her hand on her heart,\r\nand, with a deep and trembling sigh, turned back again. It was at this\r\nmoment she saw something white, no bigger than a playing-card, lie at\r\nher feet. She picked it up, entered her room, and trembling violently,\r\nclosed the window again, and was alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.--THE ORDEAL.\r\n\r\nThe next morning came with sunshine, and the merry carols of all the\r\nsylvan choirs. It would have meetly ushered in a day of rejoicing; but\r\njoy seemed to have bid an eternal adieu to the luxurious solitudes of\r\nthe Chateau des Anges.\r\n\r\nJulie that morning remarked that Lucille remained unusually late in her\r\nown rooms. Fearing that she might be ill, she ventured to visit her in\r\nher apartments. It was past twelve o'clock when she knocked at her door.\r\nThere was no answer; and she knocked repeatedly, but without success. At\r\nlast she opened the door, but Lucille was not as usual in that room. She\r\nwalked through it, and the apartment beyond it, without seeing her; but\r\nin her dressing-room, which lay beyond that again, she found her.\r\n\r\nShe was sitting in a loose morning-robe; her head was supported by her\r\nhand, and the open sleeve of heavy silk had fallen back from her white\r\nround arm. An open letter lay upon the table under her gaze. She had\r\nevidently been weeping, and was so absorbed either in her own\r\nreflections or the contents of the letter, that she did not perceive the\r\nentrance of Julie.\r\n\r\nThe visitor paused; but feeling that every moment of her undiscovered\r\npresence added to the awkwardness of her situation, she called Lucille\r\nby name.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of her name she started from her seat, and stood, pale as\r\ndeath, with all her dark hair shaken wildly about her shoulders, and her\r\neyes gleaming with a malign terror upon the intruder. At the same moment\r\nshe had clutched the letter, and continued to crumple it in her hand\r\nwith a spasmodic eagerness.\r\n\r\nJulie was almost as much confounded as Lucille. Both were silent for a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, dear Lucille; I fear my unperceived intrusion\r\nstartled you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes; I suppose I am nervous. I am not well. Oh, God! you did\r\nstartle me very much.\"\r\n\r\nTo do her justice, she looked terrified; every vestige of color had fled\r\nfrom her face, even from her lips, and her eyes continued gleaming\r\nwildly and fixedly on her.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you come, then--what do you want of me?\" she said, at last,\r\nexcitedly, and even angrily.\r\n\r\n\"I came to ask how you are, Lucille--I feared you were ill.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I ill? You know I was _not_ ill,\" she said hurriedly and\r\nimpatiently, and either forgetting or despising her own excuse of but a\r\nmoment before. \"You came--you came for a _purpose_, Julie--yes, yes--do\r\nnot deny it--there is perfidy enough already.\"\r\n\r\n\"You wrong me, Lucille; I told you the simple truth--why should I\r\ndeceive you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why--why? Because the world is full of deceit, full of falsehood and\r\ntreason--they are every where, every where.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned away, and Julie perceived that she was weeping.\r\n\r\nShe was pained and puzzled--nay, she was crossed every moment by the\r\nhorrid fear that Lucille's mind was unsettled. Her strange agitation\r\nseemed otherwise unaccountable.\r\n\r\n\"Lucille--dear Lucille--surely you will not be angry with your poor\r\nlittle friend--surely you believe Julie.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at her for a moment, and said--\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Julie, I do believe you;\" and so saying, she kissed her. \"But--but\r\nI am utterly, and I fear irremediably miserable.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is the cause of your wretchedness, my dear Lucille?\"\r\n\r\n\"This place--this solitude oppresses me; I cannot endure the isolation\r\nto which I am unnaturally and tyrannically condemned. Oh, Julie! there\r\nare circumstances, secrets, miseries, I dare not tell you; fate is\r\nweaving round me a net, to all eyes but my own invisible. But why do you\r\nlook at me with those strange glances? Do not believe that I am\r\n_guilty_, because I am miserable--do not dare to touch me with such a\r\nthought.\"\r\n\r\nShe stamped her little foot furiously on the floor at these words,\r\nwhile her cheek and eye kindled with excitement. It speedily subsided,\r\nhowever, into a deep and sullen gloom, and she continued--\r\n\r\n\"I scarce know myself, Julie, what I am, or what I may be; but my heart\r\nis as full of tumult, of suffering, of hatred, as hell itself. I will at\r\nleast be free--my captivity in this magician's prison shall terminate--I\r\n_will_ not endure it. It shall end soon, one way or another--I will\r\nliberate myself.\"\r\n\r\nLucille spoke with something more than passion--it was fierceness; and\r\nher gentle companion was filled with vague alarms. She had, as feeble\r\nnatures often have, an instinctive appreciation of the superior energy\r\nand daring of her more fiery companion, and knew that she would, too\r\nprobably, take some violent and irreparable step in furtherance of her\r\nresolution. It was, therefore, with feelings of anxiety and fear that\r\nshe left her to the solitary influence of her own angry and excited\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Le Prun did not arrive till night. As he and the Count de\r\nBlassemare rolled homeward, side by side in his carriage, under the\r\nuncertain moonlight, between the lordly rows of forest-trees that, like\r\nfiles of gloomy Titans, kept perennial guard along the approaches of the\r\nchateau, or, as Lucille has not unaptly styled it, \"the magician's\r\nprison,\" they talked pretty much as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Le Prun, my good friend, you are jealous--jealous, by all the imps in\r\ntrue love's purgatory,\" said Blassemare.\r\n\r\n\"Not jealous, but cautious.\"\r\n\r\n\"A nice distinction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, when one has reached our time of life----\"\r\n\r\n\"_Ours!_ you might be my father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I can't deny it, for nobody knows _how_ old you are. But at my\r\nyears a man with a young wife must exercise precaution. _Par bleu!_ we\r\nare neither of us fools, and I need not tell you that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes, we have had our experiences--I as a spectator--you as----\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course--therefore this threatened irruption of frivolity and vice--\"\r\n\r\n\"Say of youth and beauty; the other qualities--frivolity and vice--may\r\ncoexist with age and ugliness, and, therefore, harmlessly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what you will, it does not please me. But, under existing\r\ncircumstances, with my application pending, you know it was impossible\r\nto deny the marchioness her whim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course; and so for a single night the Chateau des Anges becomes a\r\nfairy palace. Well, what harm--you can't apprehend that a single _fete_,\r\nhowever gay and spirited, will--_ruin_ you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, no; after all, it is, as you say, but a single _fete_, and then\r\nextinguish the lights, and lock the doors, and so the Chateau des Anges\r\nbecomes as sober as before.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I wager a hundred crowns you will tell Madame Le Prun that you have\r\ngiven this _fete_ entirely on _her_ account.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought of that,\" he replied, with a grin; \"but it would not be\r\nwise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it would make a precedent.\"\r\n\r\n\"And will you never again indulge her fancy for society?\"\r\n\r\n\"By ---- my good friend, _never_. She fancies she has a great deal of\r\nspirit, and will contrive to rule me; but she does not know Etienne Le\r\nPrun--she does not know him--I will treat her like what she is--a\r\nchild.\"\r\n\r\n\"And she will treat you, perhaps, like----\"\r\n\r\n\"Like what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like what you are--a bridegroom of seventy.\"\r\n\r\n\"If she dares. Ay, Blassemare, I have just as little trust as you in\r\nwhat conventionality calls the _virtue_ of the sex. I rely upon my own\r\nstrong will--the discipline I can put in force, and their salutary\r\nfears.\"\r\n\r\nThere was here a pause of more than a minute in the dialogue; each\r\nappeared to have enough to think of, and the carriage was driving nearly\r\nat a gallop under the funereal shadow of the dense and lofty trees. With\r\na fierce start, Monsieur Le Prun cried, suddenly--\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"_I?_--nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you say _that_?\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"You said--Bluebeard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay!--what the devil did you mean by that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon my soul, I said no such thing,\" said Blassemare, with a hollow,\r\nsatirical laugh.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Le Prun glanced over his shoulder once or twice, and then\r\nhummed to himself for a time.\r\n\r\n\"Seriously,\" he repeated, \"did you not call me by that name?\"\r\n\r\n\"_I!_--no; I always call things by their name, and yours is gray.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hem!--what is he driving in this shadow for? Tell him to keep in the\r\nmoonlight--one would think he wanted to break our necks.\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur Le Prun, it was evident, had become fidgety and fanciful.\r\n\r\nA few minutes' rapid driving brought the carriage to the hall-door of\r\nthe chateau, and its wealthy, but, perhaps, after all, not very much to\r\nbe envied, master conducted his familiar imp, Blassemare, into a saloon,\r\nwhere supper awaited them.\r\n\r\n\"I don't myself understand these things, Blassemare, but you will be my\r\nstage-manager, and get up the spectacle in the best style.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes. I don't see why I should not lend a hand, that is to say, if\r\nnothing happens to call me away,\" said Blassemare, who delighted in such\r\naffairs, but liked a little importance also.\r\n\r\n\"How soon is it to take place?\"\r\n\r\n\"She said in about three weeks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! very good.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the Count de Blassemare was instantaneously translated, in spirit,\r\namong feu d'artifice, water-works, arches, colored lamps, bands, and all\r\nthe other splendors and delectations of an elaborate fete.\r\n\r\n\"I remember,\" said Le Prun, abruptly dispelling these happy and gorgeous\r\nvisions with his harsh tones, \"when I was at school, reading about\r\nSocrates and those invisible demons that were always hovering at his\r\nears; it was devilish odd, Blassemare. But to be sure those were\r\ngood-natured devils; ay, that is true, and meant him no harm.\"\r\n\r\n\"By my faith, I forget all about it; but what the devil connection have\r\nthese demons, blue, black, or red, with your fete?\"\r\n\r\n\"I sometimes think, Blassemare, you are a worse fellow than I am, for\r\nyou have no qualms of conscience.\"\r\n\r\n\"No qualms of stomach, no fumes of indigestion; as for conscience, it is\r\nan infirmity of which we both stand equally acquitted.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not speak of it in a good sense,\" said Le Prun, gloomily; \"it may\r\nbe remorse or superstition, but I fancy the man who has none of it is\r\nalready dead, and under his coffin-lid, so far as his spiritual chances\r\nare concerned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Faith, it is a treat, Le Prun, to hear you talk religion. When do you\r\nmean to take orders? I should so like to see you, my buck, in a cassock\r\nand cowl begging meal, and telling your beads, and calling yourself\r\nbrother Ambrose.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not good enough in me for that,\" he replied, in a tone which\r\nmight be earnest, or might be a sneer; \"besides, I dare say that the\r\ngrand _melange_ of rapture and diablerie they call religion is\r\naltogether true; but _par bleu!_ my good fellow, there is something more\r\nthan this life--agencies, subtler and more powerful mayhap than those\r\nour senses are commonly cognizant of. I say I have had experience of\r\nthis truth, and of them. You laugh! and I suppose will laugh on, until\r\nthat irresistible old gentleman-usher, DEATH, presents you to other\r\nrealities face to face.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, so be it. If they have faces, I suppose they have mouths, and can\r\nlaugh, and chat, and so, egad I'll make the best of them; it is one\r\ncomfort, we shall all understand religion then, and need not plague our\r\nheads about it any further. But, in the mean time, suppose we have a\r\ngame of piquet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Agreed! call for cards, and, by the time you have got them, I will\r\nreturn.\"\r\n\r\nLe Prun took a candle, and opening a door which led through a passage to\r\na back stair communicating with Lucille's apartments, he directed his\r\nsteps thither for the purpose of announcing his arrival, and\r\nascertaining at the same time the state of his wife's temper.\r\n\r\nHe tapped at the door, and, having received permission to enter, did so\r\nto the manifest surprise of the occupants of the chamber, who had\r\nexpected to see one of the servants.\r\n\r\nJulie, who was in the very middle of a story about the Marquis de\r\nSecqville, her intended husband, (to which Lucille was listening, as she\r\nleaned pensively back in her rich fauteuil, with downcast eyes,)\r\nsuspended her narrative.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, madame?\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the curt and menacing greeting exchanged between the\r\nfermier-general and his wife.\r\n\r\n\"You appear dissatisfied,\" he said, after an interval, and having taken\r\na chair.\r\n\r\n\"I _am_ so.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is tiresome, _ma femme_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, insupportably; _this_, and every thing else that passes here.\"\r\n\r\n\"It appears to me, you are somewhat hard to please.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite the reverse. I ask but to mix in human society.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have society enough, madame.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have absolutely none, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't say what society you enjoyed in the Parc de Charrebourg,\r\nmadame,\" he began, in an obvious vein of sarcasm. And as he did so, he\r\nthought he observed her eyes averted, and her color brighten for a\r\nmoment. He did not suffer this observation to interrupt him, but he laid\r\nit up in the charnel of his evil remembrances, and continued: \"I don't\r\nknow, I say, what society you there enjoyed. It may have been very\r\nconsiderable, or it may have been very limited: it was possibly very\r\ndull, or possibly very delightful, madame. But if you _had_ any society\r\nthere _whatever_, it was private, secret; it was neither seen nor\r\nsuspected, madame, and, therefore, you must excuse me if I can't see\r\nwhat sacrifice, in point of society, you have made in exchanging your\r\n_cottage_ in the Parc de Charrebourg for a residence in the Chateau des\r\nAnges.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I _have_ made sacrifices--I have lost my liberty, and gained you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see, my pretty wife, it will be necessary that you and I should\r\nunderstand one another,\" he said, tranquilly, but with a gloom upon his\r\ncountenance that momentarily grew darker and darker.\r\n\r\n\"That is precisely what I desire,\" replied his undaunted helpmate.\r\n\r\n\"Leave us, Julie,\" said the fermier-general, with a forced calmness.\r\n\r\nJulie threw an imploring glance at Lucille as she left the room, for she\r\nheld her uncle in secret dread. As she glided through the door her last\r\nlook revealed them seated at the little table; he--ugly: black, and\r\nvenomous; she--beautiful, and glittering in gay colors. It was like a\r\nsummer fly basking unconsciously within the pounce of a brown and\r\nbloated spider.\r\n\r\n\"Depend upon it, madame, this will never do,\" he began.\r\n\r\n\"Never, sir,\" she repeated emphatically.\r\n\r\n\"Be silent, and listen as becomes you,\" he almost shouted, with a sudden\r\nand incontrollable explosion of rage, while the blood mounted to his\r\ndiscolored visage. \"Don't fancy, madame, that I am doting, or that you\r\ncan manage me with your saucy coquetry or sulky insolence. I have a\r\nwill of my own, madame, under which, by Heaven, I'll force yours to\r\nbend, were it fifty times as stubborn as ever woman's was yet. You shall\r\nobey--you shall submit. If you will not practise your duty cheerfully,\r\nyou shall learn it in privation and tears; but one way or another, I'll\r\nbring you to act, and to speak, and to _think_ as I please, or I'm not\r\nyour husband.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, try it: and in the mean time, I expect----\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you expect?\" he thundered.\r\n\r\n\"I expect to receive a counterpart of this,\" she said, with deliberate\r\nemphasis, holding the magic vial steadily before his eyes.\r\n\r\nFor a second or two, the talisman appeared powerless, but only for so\r\nlong. On a sudden his gaze contracted--he became fascinated,\r\npetrified--his face darkened, as if a tide of molten lead were projected\r\nthrough every vessel--and a heavy dew of agony stood in beads upon his\r\npuckered forehead. With all this horror was mingled a fury, if possible,\r\nmore frightful still; every fibre of his face was quivering; the hand\r\nthat was clenched and drawn back, as if it held a weapon to be hurled\r\ninto her heart, was quivering too; his mouth seemed gasping in vain for\r\nwords or voice; he resembled the malignant and tortured victim of a\r\nsatanic possession; and this frightful dumb apparition was imperceptibly\r\ndrawing nearer and nearer to her.\r\n\r\nA sudden revulsion broke the horrid spell of which he was the slave;\r\nlike one awaking from a nightmare, conscience-stricken, he uttered a\r\ntrembling groan of agony, and with one hand upon his breast, the other\r\nclutched upon his forehead, he hurried, speechless, like a despairing,\r\ndetected criminal, from the room.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.--THE UNTOLD SECRET.\r\n\r\nJulie, who had heard high words as she traversed the apartments which\r\nlay _en suite_, paused in the lobby at the stair-head--a sort of _oeil\r\nde boeuf_, to which several corridors converged, and with a lofty\r\nlantern-dome above, from which swung a cluster of rose-colored lamps.\r\n\r\nHere she sat down upon a sofa, ill at ease on account of the scene which\r\nwas then going on so near her; and, in the midst of her reverie, raising\r\nher eyes suddenly, she saw Monsieur Le Prun, the thick carpets rendering\r\nhis tread perfectly noiseless, gliding by her with a countenance guilty\r\nand terrible beyond any thing that fancy had ever seen.\r\n\r\nWithout appearing to see her, like a spectre from the grave he came,\r\npassed, and vanished, leaving her frozen with horror, as if she had\r\nbeheld a phantom from the dead and damned.\r\n\r\nWith steps winged with hideous alarm she sped through the intervening\r\nchambers to that in which she had left Lucille.\r\n\r\nShe was standing with an ashy smile of triumph on her face, and in her\r\nhand was still mechanically grasped the queer little vial with its four\r\nspires of gold.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Le Prun had recovered his self-possession to a certain extent\r\nby the time he reached the apartment where he had left Blassemare. But\r\nthat observant gentleman did not fail to perceive, at a glance, that\r\nsomething had occurred to agitate his patron profoundly.\r\n\r\n\"Egad,\" he thought, \"I should not be surprised if the girl were taken at\r\ndisadvantage by his abrupt visit, and that the venerable Adonis saw\r\nsomething to justify his jealousy. A husband has no right to surprise\r\nhis wife. Le Prun,\" he continued carelessly aloud, \"I wonder why Nature,\r\nwho has been so bounteous to the sex, has not furnished husbands, like\r\ncertain snakes, with rattles to their tails, to give involuntary warning\r\nof their approach.\"\r\n\r\nLe Prun poured out a glass of cold water and drank it. Blassemare\r\nobserved, as he did so, that his hand trembled violently. The\r\nfermier-general was silent, and his flippant Mercury did not care just\r\nthen to hazard any experiment upon his temper.\r\n\r\n\"Blassemare!\" he exclaimed, abruptly arresting his glass, and eyeing his\r\ncompanion with a sort of brutal rage, \"I ought to run you through the\r\nbody, sir, where you stand, for your accursed perfidy.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! _me?_--by my soul, sir, I don't understand you,\" he replied, at\r\nonce offended and amazed. \"Why the devil should you murder me?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have broken your word with me!\"\r\n\r\n\"In what respect?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly where it was most vitally needful to keep it, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Deuce take me if I know what you mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do--you _do_--a thousand curses! You _must_ know it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But hang me if I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have suffered that _calumny_ to reach her ears.\"\r\n\r\n\"What calumny?\"\r\n\r\n\"She must have seen her.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Her!_--whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"She must have spoken with her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do say, plainly, what it _is_ all about?\"\r\n\r\n\"About that--that d---- woman; there, is _that_ intelligible? She is at\r\nlarge, sir, in spite of all I've said--in spite of all you undertook,\r\nsir; and she has been filling my wife's ears with those hell-born lies\r\nthat have been whispered to _you_, sir, and which it was your business\r\nto have suppressed and extinguished. By ----, Blassemare, you deserve my\r\ncurses and my vengeance.\"\r\n\r\nAs he concluded, he struck the glass upon the table with a force that\r\nshivered it to pieces.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur le Prun,\" said Blassemare, coolly, \"I deprecate no man's\r\nvengeance, and fear no man's sword; but whatever be the ground of your\r\npresent convictions, it is utterly fallacious. The person in question\r\nhas never stirred abroad--you mean the _sister_ of course--since your\r\nmarriage, except under close and trustworthy attendance; and the\r\nother--_that_ you know is out of the question.\"\r\n\r\n\"There has been mismanagement somewhere, or else some new device of\r\ninfernal malice; I say the thing has been misconducted, with the same\r\ncursed blundering that has always attended that affair; and I would\r\nrather my wife were in her coffin than have seen what I have seen\r\nto-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! in her coffin!\" echoed Blassemare, with a sort of fiendish\r\nsatire.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, sir, in her coffin!\" said Le Prun, with a black defiance which made\r\nBlassemare shrug his shoulders and become silent.\r\n\r\nThe chill and the smell of death seemed to him to have come with these\r\nwords into the room. But he would not on any account have betrayed his\r\nsensations; on the contrary, he pointed gayly to the cards, and looked a\r\nsmiling interrogatory towards the fermier. But that excellent gentleman\r\nwas in no mood for picquet. He declined the challenge gloomily and\r\nperemptorily.\r\n\r\n\"_Ma foi!_ you suffer trifles to plague you strangely,\" said Blassemare,\r\nas they parted for the night. \"What on earth does it signify after all?\r\nThwart a woman, and she will strive to vex you--there's nothing new in\r\nthat; why should not Madame Le Prun share the pretty weaknesses of her\r\nsex? On the other hand, indulge her, and she will flatter as much as she\r\nteased before. You are too sensitive, too fond, and, therefore,\r\nexaggerate trifles. Good night.\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur Le Prun withdrew, and Blassemare muttered--\r\n\r\n\"Remorseless old criminal! I shall keep my eye close upon you, and if I\r\nsee any sign of the sort----\"\r\n\r\nHe set his teeth together, smiled resolutely and threateningly, and\r\nnodded his head twice or thrice in the direction of the door through\r\nwhich the fermier-general had just disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe violent explosion we have just described was not followed by any\r\nvery decisive results. The fermier-general and his wife had not been\r\nupon very pleasant terms for some time previous to the scene which had\r\nso fearfully agitated the millionaire; and, whatever may have been the\r\nimmediate promptings of his anger, his temper had cooled down\r\nsufficiently, before the morning, to enable him to carry the matter off,\r\nlike a man of the world, with a tolerable grace. Whatever change for the\r\nworse had taken place in his feelings towards his wife, he was able to\r\nsuppress the manifestation of it: but, as we have said, their relations\r\nhad of late been by no means cordial, and Monsieur Le Prun did not think\r\nit necessary to affect any warmer sentiment toward his wife, nor any\r\nabatement of the sinister estrangement which had been gradually growing\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the preparations for the _fete_ proceeded at the Chateau des\r\nAnges upon a scale worthy of the rarity of the occasion and the vastness\r\nof the proprietor's fortune.\r\n\r\nAll these were carried on by Blassemare, who indulged his gallantry by\r\nconsulting the beautiful young wife of the fermier-general upon every\r\ndetail of the tasteful and magnificent arrangements as they proceeded.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Le Prun had a special object in gratifying the great lady who\r\nhad insisted upon this sacrifice. Blassemare had, therefore, a _carte\r\nblanche_ in the matter. There were to be musicians from Paris, bands of\r\nwinged instruments among the trees, galleys and singers upon the waters,\r\nilluminated marquees and fanciful grottoes, feu d'artifice, and colored\r\nlamps of every dye, in unimaginable profusion, theatricals, gaming,\r\nfeasting, dancing--in a word, every imaginable species of gayety,\r\nrevelry, and splendor.\r\n\r\nAs these grand projects began to unfold themselves, Lucille's ill-temper\r\nbegan to abate. Her interest was awakened, and at last she became\r\npleased, astonished, and even delighted.\r\n\r\nNow at length she hoped that the long-cherished object of her wishes was\r\nabout to be supplied, and that she was indeed to emerge from her\r\nchrysalis state, and enjoy, among the sweets and gayeties of life, the\r\nglittering freedom for which she felt herself so fitted, and had so long\r\nsighed in vain; and which, moreover, as the reader may have suspected,\r\nshe desired also in furtherance of certain secret and cherished\r\naspirations.\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Blassemare found his aesthetic and festive confidences most\r\nencouragingly received by the handsome and imperious Madame Le Prun. The\r\nsubject of his consultations delighted her; and knowing well the close\r\nrelation in which he stood with her husband, she perhaps thought it no\r\nsuch bad policy to secure him, by a little civility, in her interest.\r\nShe little imagined, perhaps, engrossed as she was with other images, to\r\nwhat aspiring hopes she was thus unconsciously introducing the Sieur de\r\nBlassemare. That gentleman was proud of his _bonnes fortunes_; and the\r\nrapid chemistry of his vanity instantaneously transmuted the lightest\r\nshow of good-humor, in a handsome woman, into the faint but\r\nirrepressible evidences of a warmer sentiment of preference.\r\n\r\nPerfectly convinced of the reality of the _penchant_ he believed himself\r\nto have inspired, you may be sure the lively scoundrel was not a little\r\nflattered at his imaginary conquest. He debated, therefore, in his\r\nself-complacent reveries, whether he should take prompt advantage of the\r\nweakness of his victim, or pique her by the malice of suspense. He chose\r\nthe latter tactique, and, with a happy self-esteem, reserved the\r\ntransports of his confession to reward the longings and agitations of a\r\nprotracted probationary ordeal.\r\n\r\nThus Blassemare was in his glory, superintending the preparations for a\r\n_fete_, which left him nothing in prodigality and magnificence to\r\ndesire; enjoying, at the same time, the delightful consciousness of\r\nhaving placed, without an effort, the prettiest woman in France at his\r\nfeet, and the _piquant_ sense, beside, of his little treason against old\r\nLe Prun.\r\n\r\nThus matters proceeded; but, strange to say, while the evening for which\r\nall these preparations were being made was still more than a week\r\ndistant, Madame Le Prun, whose impatience of even that brief delay had\r\nbeen unspeakable, on a sudden lost all her interest in the affair. Such,\r\nalas! is the volatility, the caprice, of women. The object for sake of\r\nwhich she had led poor Le Prun a dog's life for so long, was now\r\npresented to her, and she turned from it with indifference, if not with\r\ndisgust. This would, indeed, have been very provoking to Le Prun\r\nhimself, had he been just then upon speaking terms with his wife; but\r\nnot happening to be so, and being in no mood to talk about her further\r\nto his gay familiar, Blassemare, he was wholly ignorant of those\r\nfeminine fluctuations of interest and of liking which Blassemare himself\r\ndid not fully comprehend. The change was so abrupt as to excite his\r\nsurprise. Her apathy, too, was unaccompanied by ill-temper, and was\r\nobviously so genuine, that he could hardly believe it affected merely to\r\npique him. We are disposed to think there was a powerful, but\r\nmysterious, cause at work in this change.\r\n\r\nIt was just about this time that one night, Julie, having sat up rather\r\nlater than usual, and intending to bid Lucille good night, if she were\r\nstill awake, entered her suite of apartments, and approached her\r\ndressing-room door. She heard her rush across the floor, as she did so,\r\nand, with a face of terror, she emerged from the door and stood before\r\nit, as if to bar ingress to the room.\r\n\r\nJulie was disconcerted and agitated by this apparition; and Lucille was\r\nevidently, from whatever cause, greatly terrified. The two girls\r\nconfronted one another with pale and troubled looks. Lucille was white\r\nwith fear, and, alas! as it seemed to her companion, with the agitation\r\nof guilt. Julie looked at her all aghast.\r\n\r\n\"Good night, Julie, good night,\" she whispered, hurriedly.\r\n\r\n\"Good night,\" answered she; \"I fear I have interrupted--I mean, startled\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good night, good night,\" repeated Lucille.\r\n\r\nAs Julie retreated across the lobby, she was overtaken by Lucille, who\r\nplaced her hand upon her shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Julie, will you hate me if I tell you all?\" she said, in great\r\nagitation, as she hurried with her into her apartment.\r\n\r\n\"_Hate_ you, Lucille! How could I hate my dear friend and companion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Friend, O yes, _friend_; what a friend I have proved to you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, come, you must not let yourself be excited; you know you are my\r\nfriend, my _only_ friend and confidante, and you know I love you.\"\r\n\r\nLucille covered her face with her hands and sobbed or shuddered\r\nviolently. Julie embraced and kissed her tenderly; but, in the midst of\r\nthese caresses, her unhappy friend threw her arms about her neck, and,\r\nlooking earnestly in her face for a few seconds, drew her passionately\r\nto her heart and kissed her, murmuring as she did so--\r\n\r\n\"No, no; she never could forgive me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, so saying, she mournfully betook herself away, leaving Julie a prey\r\nto all manner of vague and perplexing alarms.\r\n\r\nWhatever was the cause of Lucille's profound mental agitation, it was an\r\nimpenetrable mystery to Julie. Blassemare obviously did not know what to\r\nmake of it; and as the fete drew near without eliciting any\r\ncorresponding interest on her part, Julie, who had observed with\r\npleasure the delight with which at first she had anticipated the event,\r\nwas dismayed and astonished at the change. As often as she had\r\nendeavored to recall her to the topic so strangely approached, and\r\ninexplicably recoiled from, upon the occasion we have just described,\r\nLucille repulsed her curiosity, or at least evaded it with entire and\r\nimpenetrable secrecy. Finding, therefore, that the subject was obviously\r\ndistasteful to her, she forbore to return to it, and contented herself\r\nwith recording the broken conversation of the night in question among\r\nthe other unexplained mysteries of her life.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Lucille,\" she said to her one day, as they were walking upon the\r\nterrace together, and interrupting by the remark a long and gloomy\r\nsilence, \"you do not seem to enjoy the prospect of the gay night which\r\nmy uncle has prepared, now that it approaches, half so much as you did\r\nin the distance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enjoy it? no, no.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you longed for such an occasion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps, Julie, I had reasons; perhaps it was not all caprice.\"\r\n\r\n\"But do you not still enjoy the prospect? surely it has not lost all its\r\ncharms?\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, Julie, I had reasons--that is, perhaps I had--for wishing it. I\r\nhave none now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, but it seems to me it positively depresses you. Surely, if it\r\nwere merely indifferent, it need not distress you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Julie, Julie, we are strange creatures; we know not ourselves,\r\nneither our strength nor our weakness, our good nor our evil, until time\r\nand combinations solve the problem, and show us the sad truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me,\" said Julie, with a gentle smile, \"you take a wondrous\r\nmoral tone in treating of a ball, my pretty sage; and, notwithstanding\r\nall you say, I suspect you like a fete as well as most young women.\"\r\n\r\n\"Julie, when I tell you honestly I hate it--that I would gladly be\r\nhidden in the roof or the cellar of the loneliest tower in the chateau\r\nupon that evening, you will cease to suspect me of so poor a\r\ndissimulation. Honestly, then, and sadly, these crowded festivities, I\r\nexpected but a short time since with so much delight, are now not only\r\nindifferent to me, but repulsive. I no longer wish to meet and mix with\r\npeople; the idea, on the contrary, depresses, nay, even terrifies me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lucille, you are hiding something from me.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Hiding!_--no, nothing--that is, nothing but my own thoughts, the\r\nimages of my reflections; nothing, dear Julie, that it would not render\r\nyou unhappy to hear. Why should I throw upon your mind the gloom and\r\nshadows of my own?\"\r\n\r\n\"But perhaps your troubles are fantastic and unreal; and, were you to\r\nconfide in me, I might convince you that they are so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Julie, they are real.\"\r\n\r\n\"So thinks every body who is haunted by chimeras.\"\r\n\r\n\"These are none. Oh, Julie! would I could tell you all. The agony of the\r\nrelation would be in some sort recompensed by having one human being to\r\ntell my thoughts to. But it cannot be; it is quite, quite impossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"This impossibility is also one of the imagination.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, Julie; the effort to repose this confidence would destroy _all_\r\nconfidence between us. I have said enough--let us speak of other\r\nmatters. My innermost grief, be it what it may, I must endure alone.\r\nJulie, it is a hard condition; but I must and will--alone.\"\r\n\r\nHere they were interrupted by Blassemare, who gayly joined them, with a\r\nprayer that they would resolve a momentous difficulty, by deciding upon\r\nthe best site for one of his principal batteries of fireworks; and so,\r\nwith little good-will, they surrendered themselves for a quarter of an\r\nhour to the guidance and the light sarcastic conversation of the master\r\nof the revels, with whom for the present we shall leave them.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.--THE FETE.\r\n\r\nAt length the eventful night arrived--a beautiful, still, star-lit\r\nnight. You may fancy the splendor of the more than royal festivities.\r\nWhat a magnificent levee of gayety, rank, and beauty! What unexampled\r\nilluminations!--what fantastic and inexhaustible ingenuity of\r\npyrotechnics! How the gorgeous suites of salons laughed with the\r\nbrilliant crowd! How the terraces, arched and lined with soft-colored\r\nlamps, re-echoed with gay laughter or murmured flatteries! What an\r\natmosphere it was of rosy hues, of music, and ceaseless hum of human\r\nenjoyment! For miles around, the wandering peasants beheld the wide,\r\nmisty, prismatic circle that overarched the enchanted ground, and heard\r\nthe silver harmonies and drumming thunders of the orchestras floating\r\nover the woods, and filling the void darkness with sounds of unseen\r\nfestivities. In such a scene all are in good-humor--all wear their best\r\nlooks. Each finds his appropriate amusement. The elegant gamester\r\ndiscovers his cards and his companions; the garrulous find listeners;\r\nthe gossip retails, and imbibes, from a hundred sources, all the current\r\nscandal; vanity finds incense--beauty adoration; the young make love, or\r\ndance, or in groups give their spirits play in pleasantries, and\r\nraillery, and peals of animated laughter; their elders listen to the\r\nmusic, or watch the cards, or in a calmer fashion converse; while all,\r\neach according to his own peculiar taste, find whatever pleases their\r\npalate best. Whatever is rarest, most fantastic--things only dreamed\r\nof--the epicurean connoisseur has only to invoke, and, at a touch of the\r\nmagic wand of Mammon, it is there before him. Wines, too,--what-not,\r\nest-est, tokay, and all the rest, flowing from the inexhaustible tap of\r\nthe same Mephistopheles, with his golden gimlet. All the demons of\r\nluxury riot there, and at your nod ransack the earth for a flavor or a\r\nflask; and place it before you, almost before your wish is uttered. It\r\nis, indeed, the Mahomet's paradise of all true believers in the stomach,\r\nand worshippers of Bacchus. Thus in a realized dream all eddies on in a\r\ndelicious intoxication, and each is at once the recipient of enjoyment\r\nand the dispenser of good-humor, imbibing through every sense enchanted\r\nfare, reflecting smiles, and radiating hilarity. Each, indeed, becomes,\r\nas it were, a single glowing particle in the genial and brilliant mass,\r\nand tends to keep alive the general fire, from which he derives and to\r\nwhich returns at once light and geniality. It is admitted that he who\r\nhas discovered the grand arcanum, and has the philosopher's stone in his\r\nwaistcoat-pocket, is, so to speak, _ex officio_, a magician. But M. Le\r\nPrun had no need of any such discoveries. He had the gold itself, and\r\nwas, therefore, a ready-made magician, and as such was worshipped\r\naccordingly with an oriental fanaticism.\r\n\r\nMonsieur le Prun had, like other favorites of fortune in the latter days\r\nof the monarchy, purchased his patent of noblesse. Every body knew that\r\nhe was a _parvenu_; and rumor, as she is wont in such cases, had adorned\r\nhis early history with so many myths and portents, that Niebuhr himself\r\ncould hardly have distinguished between the fable and the truth. It was\r\nsaid and believed that he was a foundling--a Gipsy's son, a wandering\r\nbeggar, a tinker. Others had seen him in rags, selling pencils at the\r\nsteps between the Pont-Neuf and the Pont-au-Change. Others, again,\r\nmaintained that he had for years filled the canine office of guide to an\r\nold blind mendicant, whose beat was about the Rue de Bauboug; and were\r\neven furnished with a number of pleasant anecdotes about his hardships\r\nand adroitness, while in this somewhat undignified position. Indeed, the\r\nvarieties of positions though which good Mother Gossip sent him were\r\nsuch, and so interminable, that a relation of half of them would alone\r\nmake a library of fiction. But fortune had consecrated this mean and\r\nsmutty urchin. He stood now worshipped in the awful glory of his\r\nmillions, pedestalled on his money-bags, gilded from head to heel; and\r\nwhat could the proudest noblesse upon earth do but forget and forgive\r\nthe rags and hunger of his infancy, and come together, from the east and\r\nfrom the west, to drink of the cup of his enchantments, and cry, \"Long\r\nlive King Solomon in all his glory?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is beautiful as a divinity,\" exclaimed the gallant old Marquess de\r\nFauteuil, who had just completed an admiring survey of the fair Madame\r\nle Prun.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty--yes; but she has the manners of a _petite moine_,\" said the\r\nDuchess de la Cominade, an old flame of the marquis, who, in spite of\r\nher marriage and her mistakes, conceived her claims upon his devotions\r\nunabated.\r\n\r\n\"And her little gossip, too, Le Prun's niece, is a charming creature--an\r\nexquisitely contrived contrast. By my word, this place deserves its\r\nname--is it not truly the Chateau des Anges?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is that young person whom Le Prun is leading towards them? He is\r\nthe only man I have seen to-night whose dress is perfect; and he looks\r\nlike a hero of romance.\"\r\n\r\n\"That?--eh? Why that is the Marquis de Secqville.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! the horrid man who enslaves us all? I have not seen him for\r\nyears--how very handsome he is!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; and I fancy that melancholy air assists him very much in\r\nvanquishing the gentle sex. I once had a little vein of that myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you had,\" murmured the duchess, with a tender smile of memory, and a\r\nlittle sigh. \"But is it not a madness of poor Le Prun to present that\r\nterrible man to his handsome young wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is to marry the niece--the affair is concluded. Poor little thing!\r\nshe looks so frightened; see--a little fluttered pigeon of Venus--it\r\nbecomes her very much.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Le Prun and the marquis were approaching Lucille and Julie,\r\nwho were seated together close to a window which opened to the floor,\r\nand admitted the soft summer air, charged with such sounds and perfumes\r\nas might have hovered among the evergreen groves of Calypso's island.\r\n\r\n\"He is coming,\" said Julie, \"he is coming with my uncle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who?\" asked Lucille, looking coldly on the advancing figures.\r\n\r\n\"My--my fiance, the Marquis de Secqville,\" whispered Julie, in trembling\r\nhaste, blushing, and dropping her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, then, I must observe him carefully,\" said Lucille, with an arch\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"Do, and tell me honestly what you think of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! little rogue, I see you are not quite so indifferent as you\r\npretend.\"\r\n\r\n\"My _heart_ is indifferent--but--but he is very handsome--don't you\r\nthink so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush! here he is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have the happiness, madame, to present Monsieur le Marquis de\r\nSecqville, with whom, as you are aware, we are about to have the honor\r\nof being nearly allied.\"\r\n\r\nSo said Monsieur le Prun, with a smile of conjugal affection, which may,\r\nor may not, have been genuine.\r\n\r\n\"I was not until now aware of the full extent of the honor and the\r\nhappiness involved in that alliance,\" said the marquis, with a glance of\r\nrespectful admiration.\r\n\r\nMadame le Prun acknowledged this little speech with a slight bow, and a\r\ncold and haughty smile.\r\n\r\n\"You have been in the south lately?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madame, with my regiment at Avignon.\"\r\n\r\n\"So he says,\" interrupted the fermier-general, with a cunning leer; \"but\r\nhis colonel swears he never saw him there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then either you or your colonel must be wrong,\" said Madame le Prun,\r\ndrily.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, madame; but Monsieur le Prun likes a jest at my expense.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" said Le Prun, laughing; \"I protest D'Artois, his colonel,\r\nvows he has not seen him for six months at least.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are in a conspiracy to quiz me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you _were_ at Avignon?\"\r\n\r\n\"No such thing, I tell you; the fellow was about some mischief--ha! ha!\r\nha!\"\r\n\r\n\"He is resolved to laugh at me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, I say he is a mischievous fellow--the most dangerous dog in\r\nFrance; and so shy that, by my word, it requires a shrewd fellow like\r\nmyself to discover his rogueries.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so he deserves not only _all_ my sins, but a great deal more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay--here is the Visconte de Charrebourg. Visconte, this is the\r\nMarquis de Secqville, my future nephew.\"\r\n\r\nThe old visconte looked closely and dubiously for a moment in the young\r\nman's face. The marquis, on the contrary, seemed to have some little\r\ndifficulty in suppressing a smile.\r\n\r\n\"But that I know I have not had the honor of meeting you before, I\r\nshould----but no doubt it is a family likeness. I knew your father when\r\nhe was about your age, and a very handsome fellow, by my faith. Is his\r\nbrother, the Conte de Cresseron, still living?\"\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman drew the marquis away before he had had time to pay\r\nhis devoirs to Julie, who had shrunk at his approach into the\r\nbackground, and left the little group to themselves.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of him?\" whispered Julie, resuming her place by\r\nLucille.\r\n\r\n\"He is pretty well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur le Marquis is a handsome man,\" said Blassemare, who at that\r\nmoment joined them; and, addressing Lucille, \"You have seen him before?\"\r\n\r\n\"_I?_--no. He has just been presented to me for the first time.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you think him----\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather handsome--indeed, _decidedly_ handsome; but, somehow, his\r\nmelancholy spoils him. But I forgot, Julie--I ask your pardon, my\r\npretty niece, for criticising your hero. Remember, however, I admit his\r\nbeauty, though I can't admire him.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no truth of which we have been reminded with such unnecessary\r\nreiteration, as the pretty obvious fact that every human enjoyment must,\r\nsooner or later, come to an end. The _fete_ at the Chateau des Anges had\r\nno exemption from this law of nature and necessity. Musicians, cooks,\r\nartists, and artisans of all sorts, gradually disappeared. At length the\r\nlast equipage whirled down the great avenue, and a stillness and void,\r\nmore mournful from the immediate contrast, supervened.\r\n\r\nThe windows were closed--the yawning servants betook themselves to their\r\nbeds, and the angel of sleep waved his downy wings over the old chateau.\r\nThe genius of Blassemare was of that electric sort which is not easily\r\nunexcited. He could no more have slept than he could have transformed\r\nhimself into one of the stone Tritons of the fountain by which in the\r\nmoonlight he now stood alone. Blassemare had had a magnificent triumph;\r\nso well-contrived an entertainment had never, perhaps, been known\r\nbefore; and, like certain great generals, he felt desirous to visit the\r\nfield of his victory after the heat of action was over.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Le Prun was also wide awake and astir from other causes. No\r\nvein of Blassemare's excitement--not even jealousy, nor conscience, nor\r\nany mental malady--kept him waking. The cause of his vigilance was,\r\nsimply, his late supper and an indigestion.\r\n\r\nNow it happened that both these worthies were walking unconsciously\r\nalmost side by side--Le Prun along the summit, and Blassemare along the\r\nbase, of the beautiful terrace which stretched in front of the windows\r\nof the chateau.\r\n\r\nThere was a little receding court which lay in front of Madame Le Prun's\r\nwindows, which were furnished with a heavy stone balcony. On the side\r\nopposite was a high wall, which divided the pleasure-grounds from the\r\nwild, wooded park that lay immediately beyond, and in this was a door\r\nwith a private key and a spring lock.\r\n\r\nNow it happened that both Monsieur Le Prun and the Sieur de Blassemare,\r\nas they approached this point, amid the fumes of expiring lamps and the\r\nwreck of fireworks, heard certain sounds of an unexpected sort. These\r\nwere, in fact, human voices, conversing in earnest but suppressed\r\ntones--so low, indeed, that were it not for the breathless stillness of\r\nthe night they would have been unheard.\r\n\r\n\"Sacre!\" muttered Le Prun, looking up like a toothless old panther.\r\n\r\n\"Ma foi! what's this?\" whispered Blassemare, whose jealousy was also\r\nalarmed.\r\n\r\nThe sounds continued--the eavesdroppers quickened their paces. Le Prun\r\nwas, however, unfortunately a little asthmatic, as sometimes happens to\r\nbridegrooms of a certain age, and, spite of all his efforts to hold it\r\nin, he could not contain a burst of coughing.\r\n\r\nIts effect was magical. There supervened an instantaneous silence,\r\nfollowed by the dropping of a heavy body upon the ground, as it seemed,\r\nunder Madame Le Prun's windows. The descent was, however, unfortunately\r\nmade; a dog, evidently hurt, raised a frightful yelping, making the\r\nnight additionally hideous. Blassemare hurried up the steps, and at the\r\ntop encountered Le Prun, running and panting, with his sword drawn.\r\nThere was a sound, as of hastily closing the casement above the\r\nbalcony--a light gleamed from it for an instant, and was\r\nextinguished--and, at the same moment, they beheld the dim figure of a\r\nman hurrying across the court, and darting through the opposite door,\r\nwhich shut with a crash behind him.\r\n\r\n\"Thieves! robbers!\" shouted Le Prun, dashing at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Robbers! thieves!\" cried a shrill voice of alarm from Madame Le Prun's\r\ncasement.\r\n\r\n\"Horns! antlers!\" halloed Blassemare.\r\n\r\n\"Robbers! robbers!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thieves! thieves!\"\r\n\r\nThe lady screamed, Le Prun bawled, Blassemare laughed.\r\n\r\n\"He is gone, however,\" said the latter, as soon as the explosion had a\r\nlittle subsided. \"Suppose we get the key, madame. Please throw us yours\r\nfrom the window. I promise to pink the burglar through the body.\r\nQuick--quick!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay,\" thundered Le Prun, \"the key! the key!\"\r\n\r\nMadame Le Prun was too much excited to get it in an instant. She ran\r\nhere, and flew there--she screamed and rummaged. Le Prun stormed. A key\r\nwas at last thrown out, amid prayers and imprecations. How\r\nprovoking!--it was a wrong one. Another effort--a new burst of\r\nexecration from Le Prun--another fit of laughter from Blassemare--more\r\nscreaming and pressing from the window--and all accompanied by the\r\nsustained yelping of the injured lap-dog.\r\n\r\n\"Here it is--this must be it,\" and another key clangs and jingles on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, this time it is the right key.\" The door flies open--Le Prun\r\nrushes puffing among the bushes. Blassemare sees something drop\r\nglittering to the ground as the door opens--a button and a little rag of\r\nvelvet; he says nothing, but pockets it, and joins the moonlight chase.\r\n\r\nIt is all in vain. Le Prun, perspiring and purple, his passion as\r\nswollen as his veins, knowing not what to think, but fearing every\r\nthing, staggered back, silent and exhausted; Blassemare also silent--no\r\nlonger laughing--abstracted, walks with knit brows, and compressed lips,\r\nbeside him.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Blassemare, \"you have the fullest reliance upon the\r\nhonor of your wife?\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur Le Prun growled an inarticulate curse or two, and Blassemare\r\nwhistled a minuet.\r\n\r\n\"Come, my dear Le Prun,\" he resumed, \"let us be frank; you are uneasy.\"\r\n\r\n\"About what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame Le Prun.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is not injured?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but----\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, she's in league with the thieves, may be?\" said Le Prun, with an\r\nagitated sneer.\r\n\r\n\"Precisely so,\" answered Blassemare, with a cold laugh.\r\n\r\n\"I know what you think, and I know what _I_ think,\" replied Le Prun,\r\nwith suppressed fury.\r\n\r\nHis suspicions were all awake; he was bursting with rage, and looked\r\ntruly infernal.\r\n\r\n\"On the faith of a gentleman,\" said Blassemare, with a changed tone, \"I\r\ncannot be said to _think_ any thing about the affair. I have my doubts,\r\nbut that is all. We men are naturally suspicious; but, after all, there\r\nare such things as thieves and housebreakers.\"\r\n\r\nLe Prun said nothing, but looked black and icy as the north wind.\r\n\r\n\"At all events,\" said Blassemare, \"we men of the world know how to deal\r\nwith affairs of this sort; so long as any uncertainty exists, put\r\nostensibly the best possible construction upon it. Thus much is due to\r\none's dignity in the eyes of the public; and in private we may prosecute\r\ninquiries unsuspected, and with the greater likelihood of success.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know the world as well as you, Blassemare. I'm sick of your tone of\r\nsuperiority and advice. I know when to respect and when to defy the\r\nworld. A man can no more make a fortune without tact than he can lose\r\none without folly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" said Blassemare, who was used to an occasional rebuff, and\r\nregarded a gruff word from his principal no more than he did the buzz of\r\na beetle, \"I know all that very well; but you, robust fellows, with\r\nmillions at your back, are less likely to respect those subtle and\r\ndelicate influences which sometimes, notwithstanding, carry mischief\r\nwith them, than we poor, sensitive valetudinarians, without a guinea in\r\nour pockets; and if you will permit me, I will, when I return to-day,\r\nsift the matter for you. I understand woman; it is an art in itself,\r\nthough not, perhaps, a very high one. A careless conversation with\r\nMadame Le Prun will let me further into the mystery, than a year spent\r\nin accumulating circumstantial evidence. You may rely on the result.\"\r\n\r\nThe fermier-general uttered something between a growl and a grunt, which\r\nmight or might not convey assent; and, waving Blassemare towards the\r\nhouse, walked along the terrace alone; and sat himself down upon the\r\nsteps at the further end.\r\n\r\nThe mental torpor which supervenes under sudden disasters was not, in\r\nthe case of the fermier-general, without its dreamy groups of ugly\r\nimages in prospect. As the light broke, and the darkness began to melt\r\neastward into soft crimson mists and streaks of amber, Monsieur Le Prun\r\nrose stiffly from his hard, cold seat, and, with the slow step of a man\r\nirresolute and oppressed with profound wrath and mortification, began to\r\nreturn homeward.\r\n\r\n\"Robbers!--thieves!\" he muttered bitterly. \"How glibly the traitress\r\nechoed the cry! The rascal Blassemare gave the true alarm--she did not\r\necho _that_. D---- her, and d----him! Robbers, indeed! Thieves!--very\r\nlike. I know what they came a thieving for. Upon her balcony--talking in\r\nmurmurs--the candle extinguished in such a devil of a hurry--the ready\r\ncry of 'Thieves'--the spring door open for his flight--and the long\r\ndelay to find the key. Bah! what proofs are wanting?\"\r\n\r\nHe heard just at this point a cracked voice singing a gay love verse\r\nfrom an open window. He knew the voice; every association connected with\r\nthe performance and the performer jarred upon his nerves.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed the Visconte de Charrebourg, some of whose early gayety\r\nhad returned with his good fortune. He had, such was the pride of his\r\nrich son-in-law, a little household of his own, and kept his state and\r\nhis own exorbitantly early hours in a suite of rooms assigned him,\r\nthrough one of whose windows, arrayed in a velvet cap and gown of\r\nbrocade, he was rivalling the lark and greeting the rising sun, and,\r\nwhile sipping his chocolate in the intervals, moved, with the nimble\r\nirregularity of idle and active-minded age, about his apartment.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, a pleasant affair this!\" cried a harsh voice, interrupting\r\nhis cheery occupation; and on looking round he saw the purple and\r\nsinister face of the fermier-general looming through the window.\r\n\r\n\"What affair?\" asked the visconte, in unfeigned astonishment, for he had\r\nbeen quite certain that his worthy son-in-law was quietly in his bed.\r\n\r\n\"Your daughter's conduct.\"\r\n\r\n\"What of her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just this--she is a ----!\" and, with the term of outrage, Le Prun\r\nuttered a forced laugh of fury.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot have heard you aright: be kind enough to repeat that.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a certain air of pomp and menace in this little speech, which\r\ndrove Le Prun beyond all patience. He repeated the imputation in\r\nlanguage still grosser. This was an insult which the ancient blood of\r\nthe Charrebourgs could not tolerate, and the visconte taunted him with\r\nthe honor which one of his house had done him in mingling their pure\r\nblood with that of a \"roturier.\" Then came the obvious retort, \"beggar,\"\r\nand even \"trickster,\" retaliated by a torrent of scarcely articulate\r\nscorn and execration, and an appeal to the sword, which, with brutal\r\ncontempt, (while at the same time, nevertheless, he recoiled\r\ninstinctively a foot or two from the window,) the wealthy plebeian\r\nretorted by threatening to arrest him for the sums he had advanced. Le\r\nPrun had the best of it; he left the outraged visconte quivering and\r\nshrieking like an old woman in a frenzy. It was some comfort to have\r\nwrapt another in the hell-fire that tormented himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From the Examiner.]\r\n\r\nMAZZINI ON ITALY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may--we do differ from Mazzini in many of his political views, and in\r\nour estimate of what may be the wisest policy for Italian liberals in\r\nexisting circumstances. We think that he seeks to impart to politics a\r\nmathematical precision of which they are not susceptible, and does not\r\nsufficiently regard a principle the correctness of which has been\r\nadmitted by himself, that the fact of a thing being true in principle\r\ncannot give the right of suddenly enthroning it in practice. But his\r\nerrors are all on the large and generous side. He is too apt to\r\nattribute to society the precise convictions and spirit he feels within\r\nhimself, and so to expect impossibilities, by impossible means. But\r\nthere is a power of reasoning in Mazzini, an unsullied moral purity, a\r\nchivalrous veracity and frankness, an utter abnegation of self, and a\r\ncourage that has stood the severest trials, which command not only\r\nrespect but veneration. He belongs to the martyr age of Italian\r\nliberalism, and possesses himself the highest qualities of the martyr.\r\n\r\nHis declared object in publishing the small volume[27] before us is to\r\ncorrect public opinion in England as to the Italian movement in which he\r\ntook part. But it is a statement of principles rather than a narrative\r\nof details. It is always dignified in tone, often singularly eloquent,\r\nand substantially it contains little which would be likely to draw forth\r\nan expression of willing disagreement from any well-educated,\r\nhigh-minded, liberal Englishman.\r\n\r\nMr. Mazzini thus declares his reasons\r\n\r\n     WHY THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE REPUBLICAN.\r\n\r\n     The Italian tradition is eminently republican. In England, the\r\n     aristocratic element has a powerful influence, because it has a\r\n     history: well or ill, it _has_ organized society: it has\r\n     created a power, snatched from royalty, by conquering\r\n     guarantees for the rights of the subject; it has founded in\r\n     part the wealth and the influence of England abroad. The\r\n     monarchical element has still great influence over the\r\n     tendencies of France, because it also claims an important page\r\n     in the national history; it has produced a Charlemagne, a Louis\r\n     XI., a Napoleon; it has contributed to found the unity of\r\n     France; it has shared with the communes the risks and the\r\n     honors of the struggle against feudalism; it has surrounded the\r\n     national banner with a halo of military glory. What is the\r\n     history of the monarchy and of the aristocracy of Italy? What\r\n     prominent part have they played in the national development?\r\n     What vital element have they supplied to Italian strength, or\r\n     to the unification of the future existence of Italy? The\r\n     history of our royalty in fact commences with the dominion of\r\n     Charles V., with the downfall of our liberties; it is\r\n     identified with servitude and dismemberment; it is written on a\r\n     foreign page, in the cabinets of France, of Austria, and of\r\n     Spain. Nearly all of them the issue of foreign families,\r\n     viceroys of one or other of the great powers, our kings do not\r\n     offer the example of a single individual redeeming by brilliant\r\n     personal qualities the vice of subalternity, to which his\r\n     position condemned him; not a single one who has ever evinced\r\n     any grand national aspiration. Around them in the obscurity of\r\n     their courts, gather idle or retrograde courtiers, men who call\r\n     themselves _noble_, but who have never been able to constitute\r\n     an aristocracy. An aristocracy is a compact independent body,\r\n     representing in itself an idea, and from one extremity of the\r\n     country to another, governed, more or less, by one and the same\r\n     inspiration: our nobles have lived upon the crumbs of royal\r\n     favor, and if on some rare occasions they have ventured to\r\n     place themselves in opposition to the monarch, it has not been\r\n     in the cause of the nation, but of the foreigner, or of\r\n     clerical absolutism. The nobility can never be regarded as an\r\n     historical element: it has furnished some fortunate\r\n     _Condottieri_, powerful even to tyranny, in some isolated town;\r\n     it has knelt at the feet of the foreign emperors who have\r\n     passed the Alps or crossed the sea. The original stock being\r\n     nearly everywhere extinct, the races have become degenerated\r\n     amidst corruption and ignorance. The descendants of our noble\r\n     families at Genoa, at Naples, at Venice, and at Rome, are, for\r\n     the most part specimens of absolute intellectual nullity.\r\n     Almost every thing that has worked its difficult way in art, in\r\n     literature, or in political activity, is plebeian.\r\n\r\n     In Italy the initiative of progress has always belonged to the\r\n     people, to the democratic element. It is through her communes\r\n     that she has acquired all she has ever had of liberty: through\r\n     her workmen in wool or silk, through her merchants of Genoa,\r\n     Florence, Venice, and Pisa, that she has acquired her wealth;\r\n     through her artists, plebeian and republican, from Giotto to\r\n     Michael Angelo, that she has acquired her renown; through her\r\n     navigators,--plebeian,--that she has given a world to humanity;\r\n     through her Popes--sons of the people even they--that until the\r\n     twelfth century she aided in the emancipation of the weak, and\r\n     sent forth a word of unity to humanity. All her memories of\r\n     insurrection against the foreigner are memories of the people:\r\n     all that has made the greatness of our towns, dates almost\r\n     always from a republican epoch: the educational book, the only\r\n     book read by the inhabitant of the Alps or the Transteverin who\r\n     can read, is an abridgment of the history of the Ancient Roman\r\n     Republic. This is the reason why the same men who have so long\r\n     been accused of coldness, and who had in fact witnessed with\r\n     indifference the aristocratic and royal revolutions of 1820 and\r\n     1821, arose with enthusiasm and with a true power of\r\n     self-sacrifice at the cry of _St. Mark and the Republic, God\r\n     and the People_! These words contained for them a guarantee.\r\n     They awoke in them, even unconsciously to themselves, the\r\n     all-powerful echo of a living past, a confused recollection of\r\n     glory, of strength, of conscience, and of dignity.\r\n\r\n     With such elements how would it be possible to found a monarchy\r\n     surrounded with an aristocracy? How can one speak of a balance\r\n     of powers, where there are but two forces--foreign absolutism,\r\n     and the people? How could one organize a constitutional\r\n     monarchy where the aristocracy is without a past, and where\r\n     royalty inspires neither affection nor respect?\r\n\r\nIt will surprise many candid readers to find Mr. Mazzini repeatedly\r\ndeclaring in this book that the republican, or, as he calls it, the\r\nnational party, are not responsible for the disunion, which, at a time\r\nwhen the whole nation was armed against the foreigners and might have\r\ndriven them from the country, turned its forces against its own\r\ncitizens. He gives proof that his own advice was for union till the day\r\nof victory, and _not till then_ for discussion as to what party should\r\nreap its fruits. Whether to monarch, or to people, he affirms that he\r\nwas ready to submit; he asserts repeatedly that it was only after having\r\nbeen betrayed that the national party set up for themselves; and he\r\nexpresses his belief that even now, when a union of princes has been\r\nseen to be impossible, the leadership of a single prince would be\r\naccepted by all, supposing such a fitting leader could be found. He thus\r\ndescribes\r\n\r\n     THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THEIR DETRACTORS.\r\n\r\n     They have said, and they say again, without taking advantage of\r\n     the favorable position in which events have placed them:--Let\r\n     the nation arise; let her make herself mistress of her own\r\n     territory; then, the victory once gained, let her freely decide\r\n     who shall reap the fruits. Monarch or People, we will submit\r\n     ourselves to the power she herself shall organize. Is it\r\n     possible that so moderate and rational a proposition should be\r\n     the object of such false interpretations, in a country which\r\n     reveres the idea of right and of self-government? Is it\r\n     possible that its leaders should be the object of so much\r\n     calumny?\r\n\r\n     It is time that these calumnies should cease. It matters little\r\n     to us, who act as our conscience dictates, without troubling\r\n     ourselves as to the personal result; and to whom faith and\r\n     exile have given the habit of looking higher than the praise or\r\n     blame of this earth. But it should be recognized as most\r\n     important by all who believe that political questions agitated\r\n     by whole nations, are questions eminently religious. For\r\n     religion, to all those who see more in it than the mere\r\n     materialism of forms and formulae, is not only a thought of\r\n     heaven, but the impulse which seeks to apply that thought, as\r\n     far as possible to government on earth, our rule of action for\r\n     the good of all, and for the moral development of humanity.\r\n     Politics then are like religion--sacred; and all good men are\r\n     bound to see them morally respected. Every question has a right\r\n     to serious, calm, and honest discussion. Calumny should be the\r\n     weapon of those only who have to defend not ideas, but crimes.\r\n\r\n     It is immoral to say to men who have preached clemency\r\n     throughout the whole of their political career, who have\r\n     initiated their rule by the abolition of capital punishment,\r\n     who, when in power, never signed a single sentence of exile\r\n     against those who had persecuted them, nor even against the\r\n     known enemies of their principle.--\"You are the sanguinary\r\n     organizers of _terror_, men of vengeance and of cruelty.\" It is\r\n     immoral to ascribe to them views which they never had, and to\r\n     choose to forget that they have, through the medium of the\r\n     press here and elsewhere, attracted and refuted those\r\n     communistic systems and exclusive solutions which tend to\r\n     suppress rather than to transform the elements of society; and\r\n     to say to them, \"_You are communists, you desire to abolish\r\n     property_.\" It is immoral to accuse of irreligion and impiety\r\n     men who have devoted their whole lives to the endeavor to\r\n     reconcile the religious idea, betrayed and disinherited by the\r\n     very men who pretend to be its official defenders, with the\r\n     National movement. It is immoral to insinuate accusations of\r\n     personal interest and of pillage, against men who have serenely\r\n     endured the sufferings of poverty, and whose life, accessible\r\n     to all, has never betrayed either cupidity or the desire of\r\n     luxury. It is immoral continually to proclaim, as the act of a\r\n     whole party, the death of a statesman killed by an unknown\r\n     hand, under the influence of the irritation produced by his own\r\n     acts and by the attacks of another political party, many months\r\n     before the Republican party recommenced its activity.\r\n\r\nMr. Mazzini charges no direct treachery against Carlo Alberto. He\r\ndeclares him to have been himself the victim of the weakness which\r\ncaused others as well as himself so much loss and misery. For the\r\nimpossible political project of a Kingdom of the North he was content to\r\nsurrender the grand reality of a United People which fate had placed\r\nwithin his hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES ALBERT.\r\n\r\nGenius, love, and faith were wanting in Charles Albert. Of the first,\r\nwhich reveals itself by a life entirely, logically, and resolutely\r\ndevoted to a great idea, the career of Charles Albert does not offer the\r\nleast trace; the second was stifled in him by the continual mistrust of\r\nmen and things, which was awakened by the remembrance of an unhappy\r\npast; the last was denied him by his uncertain character, wavering\r\nalways between good and evil, between _to do_ and _not to do_, between\r\ndaring and not daring. In his youth, a thought, not of virtue, but of\r\nItalian ambition--the ambition however which may be profitable to\r\nnations--had passed through his soul like lightning; but he recoiled in\r\naffright, and the remembrance of this one brilliant moment of his youth\r\npresented itself hourly to him, and tortured him like the incessant\r\nthrobbing of an old wound, instead of acting upon him as an excitement\r\nto a new life. Between the risk of losing, if he failed, the crown of\r\nhis little kingdom, and the fear of the liberty which the people, after\r\nhaving fought for him, would claim for themselves, he went hesitating\r\non, with this spectre before his eyes, stumbling at every step, without\r\nenergy to confront these dangers, without the will or power to\r\ncomprehend that to become King of Italy he must first of all forget that\r\nhe was King of Piedmont. Despotic from rooted instinct, liberal from\r\nself-love, and from a presentiment of the future, he submitted\r\nalternately to the government of Jesuits, and to that of men of\r\nprogress. A fatal disunion between thought and action, between the\r\nconception and the faculty of execution, showed itself in every act.\r\nMost of those who endeavored to place him at the head of the enterprise,\r\nwere forced to agree to this view of his character. Some of those\r\nintimate with him went so far as to whisper that he was threatened with\r\nlunacy. He was the Hamlet of Monarchy.\r\n\r\nA characteristic passage of the volume has relation to\r\n\r\n\r\nLAMARTINE'S VIEWS OF ITALIAN INDEPENDENCE.\r\n\r\nThe war between the two principles was general in Europe--the enthusiasm\r\nexcited by the movements in Italy, especially the Lombard insurrection\r\nand the prodigies of the five days, was immense; and Italy could, had\r\nshe willed it and known how, have drawn thence sufficient force to\r\ncounterbalance all the strength of hostile reaction. But to do this, it\r\nwas necessary, whatever the mean policy of the _Moderates_ might fear,\r\nto give to the movement a character so audaciously national as to alarm\r\nour enemies, and to offer the most powerful element of support to our\r\nfriends. Both felt the time was ripe, and began to believe that Italy\r\nwould be but _Italy_, and not _the Kingdom of the North_. I remember the\r\nconsoling words Lamartine addressed to me, at his house, on the eve of\r\nmy departure for Italy, and in presence, amongst others, of Alfred de\r\nVigny, and of the same Forbin Janson whom I was afterwards to meet\r\npreaching the papal restoration, and getting up various petty\r\nconspiracies and ridiculous intrigues at Rome.\r\n\r\n\"The hour has struck for you,\" said the minister, \"and I am so firmly\r\nconvinced of it, that the first words with which I have charged Monsieur\r\nd'Harcourt for the Pope are these; _Holy Father, you know that you ought\r\nto be the President of the Italian Republic_.\" But Monsieur d'Harcourt\r\nhad quite other things to say to the Pope, on the part of that faction\r\nwhich involved Lamartine in its snares whilst he imagined that he could\r\ncontrol it. For myself I attached no importance, except as a symptom, to\r\nthese words of Lamartine, a man of impulse and of noble instincts, but\r\nunstable in belief, without energy for a fixed purpose, and without real\r\nknowledge of men and things. He was indeed the echo of a tendency\r\nall-powerful, in those moments of excitement, upon the French mind; and\r\nevery re-awakening nationality, every political programme, which, if not\r\nabsolutely republican, was like that, at least, of the Italian\r\nconstituent, would have compelled the support of the most hesitating\r\ngovernment in France.\r\n\r\nFrom great things great things are born. The _dwarfish_ conception of\r\nthe _Moderates_ froze up all souls, and imposed an utter change of\r\npolitics upon France. The ITALIAN PEOPLE was an ally more than\r\nsufficiently powerful to preserve the Republic from all danger of a\r\nforeign war; a _Kingdom of the North_, in the hands of princes little to\r\nbe relied upon, and hostile, by long tradition, to the Republicans of\r\nFrance, did but add a dangerous element to the league of kings. The\r\nFrench nation became silent, and left its government free to exist\r\nwithout any foreign policy, and to leave the destinies of the republic\r\nto the impenetrable future.\r\n\r\nThe incidents described in most detail are those immediately preceding\r\nand following the fatal surrender of Milan; and it is impossible not to\r\nbe struck by the contrast of the royal and the republican party,\r\nassuming the statement to be in all respects correct. But passing this\r\nignominious period, there ought to be small difference of opinion in a\r\nfree and educated country as to where the right lay in the subsequent\r\nRoman struggle. What sensible or honest Protestant would not sympathize\r\nwith the indignant eloquence of this earnest Italian protesting against\r\nthe flimsy oratory of a Jesuit Frenchman?\r\n\r\n\r\nMAZZINI TO MONTALEMBERT.\r\n\r\n\"You base your argument upon the void; you discuss that which was, not\r\nthat which is. The Papacy is dead, choked in blood and mire; dead,\r\nbecause it has betrayed its own mission of protection to the weak\r\nagainst the oppressor; dead, because for three centuries and a half it\r\nhas prostituted itself with princes; dead, because in the name of\r\negotism and before the palaces of all the corrupt, hypocritical, and\r\nskeptical governments, it has for the second time crucified Christ;\r\ndead, because it has uttered words of faith which it did not itself\r\nbelieve; dead, because it has denied human liberty and the dignity of\r\nour immortal souls; dead, because it has condemned science in Galileo,\r\nphilosophy in Giordano Bruno, religious aspiration in John Huss and\r\nJerome of Prague, political life by an anathema against the rights of\r\nthe people, civil life by Jesuitism, the terrors of the inquisition, and\r\nthe example of corruption, the life of the family by confession\r\nconverted into a system of espionage, and by division introduced between\r\nfather and son, brother and brother, husband and wife; dead, for the\r\nprinces, by the treaty of Westphalia; dead, for the peoples, with\r\nGregory XI., in 1378, and with the commencement of the schism; dead, for\r\nItaly, since 1530, when Clement VII. and Charles V., the Pope and the\r\nEmperor, signed an infamous compact, and extinguished, at Florence, the\r\ndying liberties of Italy, as to-day you have attempted to extinguish her\r\nrising liberties in Rome; dead, because the people has risen, because\r\nPius IX. has fled, because the multitude curses him, because those very\r\nmen who for fifteen years have made war upon the priests, in the name of\r\nVoltaire, now hypocritically defend them, because you and yours defend\r\nthem, with intolerance and by force of arms, and declare that the Papacy\r\nand liberty cannot live side by side? You ask Victor Hugo to point out\r\nto you an idea which has been worshipped for eighteen centuries. It is\r\nthat idea which you have declared irreconcilable with the Papacy, and\r\nwhich was breathed into humanity by God; the idea which has withdrawn\r\nfrom Catholicism the half of the Christian world, the idea which has\r\nsnatched from you Lammennais and the flower of the intellects of Europe,\r\nthe idea of Christ, that pure, holy, and sacred liberty which you\r\ninvoked for Poland some years back, which Italy invokes for herself\r\nto-day, under the form, and with the guarantee of nationality, and which\r\nyou cannot pretend to be good for one country and bad for another,\r\nunless you believe it a part of religion to create a pariah people in\r\nthe bosom of humanity.\"\r\n\r\nVery admirably, too, and nobly written, are Mr. Mazzini's later remarks\r\non the republican and anti-papal administration of Rome, and the\r\ncoldness it met with in England and elsewhere. We must admit that it is\r\nhard for a people to struggle, suffer, and bleed alone, yet hold\r\nthemselves in this temperate attitude. It is _not_ generous, as Mr.\r\nMazzini too truly complains, in a nation having the enjoyment and the\r\nconsciousness of liberty herself, to wait until the hour of victory has\r\nsounded for another nation before she stretches out a sister's hand\r\ntowards her.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT THE REPUBLICANS DID AND ENGLAND MIGHT HAVE DONE.\r\n\r\nI affirm that with the exception of Ancona, where the triumvirate were\r\nobliged energetically to repress certain criminal acts of political\r\nvengeance, the republican cause was never sullied by the slightest\r\nexcess; that no censorship was assumed over the press before the siege,\r\nand that no occasion arose for exercising it during the siege. Not a\r\nsingle condemnation to death or exile bore witness to a severity which\r\nit would have been our right to have exercised, but which the perfect\r\nunanimity which reigned amongst all the elements of the state rendered\r\nuseless. I affirm that, except in the case of three or four priests, who\r\nhad been guilty of firing upon our combatants, and who were killed by\r\nthe people during the last days of the siege, not a single act of\r\npersonal violence was committed by any fraction of the population\r\nagainst another, and that if ever there was a city presenting the\r\nspectacle of a band of brothers pursuing a common end, and bound\r\ntogether by the same faith, it was Rome under the republican rule. The\r\ncity was inhabited by foreigners from all parts of the world, by the\r\nconsular agents, by many of your countrymen; let any one of them arise\r\nand under the guarantee of his own signature deny, if he can, the truth\r\nof what I say. Terror now reigns in Rome; the prisons are choked with\r\nmen who have been arrested and detained without trial; fifty priests are\r\nconfined in the castle of St. Angelo, whose only crime consists in their\r\nhaving lent their services in our hospitals; the citizens, the best\r\nknown for their moderation, are exiled; the army is almost entirely\r\ndissolved, the city disarmed, and the \"factious\" sent away even to the\r\nlast man; and yet France dares not consult in legal manner the will of\r\nthe populations, but re-establishes the papal authority by military\r\ndecree. I do not believe that since the dismemberment of Poland there\r\nhas been committed a more atrocious injustice, a more gross violation of\r\nthe eternal right which God has implanted in the peoples, that of\r\nappreciating and defining for themselves their own life, and governing\r\nthemselves in accordance with their own appreciation of it. And I cannot\r\nbelieve that it is well for you or for Europe that such things can be\r\naccomplished in the eyes of the world, without one nation arising out of\r\nits immobility to protest in the name of universal justice. This is to\r\nenthrone brute force, where, by the power of reason, God alone should\r\nreign; it is to substitute the sword and poniard for law--to decree a\r\nferocious war without limit of time or means between oppressors rendered\r\nsuspicious by their fears, and the oppressed abandoned to the instincts\r\nof reaction and isolation. Let Europe ponder upon these things. For if\r\nthe light of human morality becomes but a little more obscured, in that\r\ndarkness there will arise a strife that will make those who come after\r\nus shudder with dread.\r\n\r\nThe balance of power in Europe is destroyed. It consisted formerly in\r\nthe support given to the smaller states by the great powers: now they\r\nare abandoned. France in Italy, Russia in Hungary, Prussia in Germany, a\r\nlittle later perhaps in Switzerland; these are now the masters of the\r\ncontinent. England is thus made a nullity; the \"celsa sedet in Eolus in\r\narce,\" which Canning delighted to quote, to express the moderating\r\nfunction which he wished to reserve for his country, is now a\r\nmeaningless phrase. Let not your preachers of the theory of material\r\ninterests, your speculators upon extended markets deceive themselves;\r\nthere is history to teach them that political influence and commercial\r\ninfluence are closely bound together. Political sympathies hold the key\r\nof the markets; the tariff of the Roman Republic will appear to you, if\r\nyou study it, to be a declaration of sympathy towards England to which\r\nyour government did not think it necessary to respond.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd yet, above the question of right, above the question of political\r\ninterest, both of which were of a nature to excite early the attention\r\nof England, there is, as I have said, another question being agitated at\r\nRome of a very different kind of importance, and which ought to have\r\naroused all those who believe in the vital principle of religious\r\nreformation--it is that of liberty of conscience. The religious question\r\nwhich broods at the root of all political questions showed itself there\r\ngreat and visible in all its European importance. The Pope at Gaeta was\r\nthe theory of absolute infallible authority exiled from Rome for ever;\r\nand exiled from Rome was to be exiled from the world. The abolition of\r\nthe temporal power evidently drew with it, in the minds of all those who\r\nunderstood the secret of the papal authority, the emancipation of men's\r\nminds from the spiritual authority. The principle of liberty and of free\r\nconsent, elevated by the Constituent Assembly into a living active\r\nright, tended rapidly to destroy the absolutist dogma which from Rome\r\naims more than ever to enchain the universe. The high aristocracy of the\r\nRoman Catholic clergy well know the impossibility of retaining the soul\r\nin darkness, in the midst of light inundating the intelligence of men;\r\nfor this reason they carried off their Pope to Gaeta; for this reason\r\nthey now refuse all compromise. They know that any compromise would be\r\nfatal to them; that they must re-enter as conquerors, or not at all. And\r\nin the same way that the aristocracy of the clergy felt this\r\ninseparability of the two powers, the French government, in its present\r\nreactionary march, has felt that the keystone of despotism is at\r\nRome--that the ruin of the spiritual authority of the middle ages would\r\nbe the ruin of its own projects--and that the only method of securing to\r\nit a few more years of existence was to rebuild for it a temporal\r\ndomination.\r\n\r\nEngland has understood nothing of this. She has not understood what\r\nthere was of sublime and prophetic in this cry of emancipation, in this\r\nprotestation in favor of human liberty, issuing from the very heart of\r\nancient Rome, in the face of the Vatican. She has not felt that the\r\nstruggle in Rome was to cut the Gordian knot of moral servitude against\r\nwhich she has long and vainly opposed her Bible Societies, her Christian\r\nand Evangelical Alliances; and that there was being opened, had she but\r\nextended a sisterly hand to the movement, a mighty pathway for the human\r\nmind. She has not understood that one bold word, \"respect for the\r\nliberty of thought,\" opposed to the hypocritical language of the French\r\ngovernment, would have been sufficient to have inaugurated the era of a\r\nnew religious policy, and to have conquered for herself a decisive\r\nascendency upon the continent.\r\n\r\nThe writer of such passages as these may nevertheless be of good heart.\r\nThough we may not think him exactly qualified to conduct to a successful\r\nissue practical political movements in the existing state of Italian\r\nsociety, we think him qualified for something far higher and nobler.\r\nLike Knox and Wicliffe, Huss and Luther, Mr. Mazzini is no maker of\r\nephemeral arrangements and compromises; but like them he is the\r\nuncompromising asserter of principles, and the creator of a national\r\nsentiment, that will in time give law to the makers of such\r\narrangements. Looking to the yet weak and timid condition of public\r\nopinion in Italy--looking to the narrow provincial views which still\r\nhamper general society--above all, looking to the limited power of its\r\nprinces and prelates, and to the imbecile and demoralized characters of\r\nits Pio Nonos and Antonellis, we must confess that we see no hope of any\r\nimmediate political settlement, the attainment of which need make it\r\nworth while for Mr. Mazzini to compromise or abandon for a moment his\r\nmost extreme political opinions. Nothing is to be accomplished at\r\npresent; and he is therefore more usefully employed in rallying his\r\nparty by fervent reiteration of his principles, and in forming a pure\r\nand elevated public sentiment alike by his precepts and his example.\r\n\r\nHow masterly is this sketch of the career of\r\n\r\n\r\nPIO NONO.\r\n\r\nA Pope arose, by his tendencies, his progressive instincts and his love\r\nof popularity, an exception to the Popes of later times: to whom\r\nProvidence, as if to teach mankind the absolute powerlessness of the\r\ninstitution, opened, in the love and in the illusions of the people, the\r\npath to a new life. So great is the fascination exercised by great\r\nmemories--so great is the power of ancient customs--so feverish, in\r\nthese multitudes who are said to be agitated by the breath of anarchy,\r\nis the desire for authority as the guide and sanction of their progress,\r\nthat a word of pardon and tolerance from the Pope's lips sufficed to\r\ngather round him, in an enthusiasm and intoxication of affection,\r\nfriends and enemies, believers and unbelievers, the ignorant and the men\r\nof thought. One long cry, the cry of millions ready to make themselves\r\nmartyrs or conquerors at his nod, saluted him as their father and\r\nbenefactor, the regenerator of the Catholic faith and of humanity. The\r\nexperience of three ages and the inexorable logic of ideas, were at once\r\nforgotten; writers, powerful by their intellect and doctrines, until\r\nthen dreaded as adversaries, employed themselves in founding around that\r\n_One_ man systems destined to prepare for him the way to a splendid\r\ninitiative. The many advocates of liberty of conscience, weary of the\r\nspectacle of anarchy revealed by the Protestant sects, remained in\r\ndoubt. The few believers in the future church remained silent and\r\nthoughtful. It might be that history had decided too rashly, it might be\r\namongst the secrets of Providence that an institution, which had for ten\r\ncenturies at least given life and movement to Europe, should rise again,\r\nreconciled with the life and movement of humanity, from its own tomb.\r\nThe minds of the whole civilized world hung, troubled and excited, upon\r\nthe _word_ which was to issue from the Vatican.\r\n\r\nAnd where now is Pius IX.?\r\n\r\nIn the camp of the enemy: irrevocably disjoined from the progressive\r\ndestinies of humanity; irrevocably adverse to the desires, to the\r\naspirations which agitate his people and the people of believers. The\r\nexperiment is complete. The abyss between Papacy and the world is\r\nhollowed out. No earthly power can fill it up.\r\n\r\nImpelled by the impulses of his heart to seek for popularity and\r\naffection, but drawn on by the all-powerful logic of the principle that\r\nhe represents, to the severity of absolute dictatorship; seduced by the\r\nuniversal movement of men's minds, by living examples in other\r\ncountries, by the spirit of the age, to feel, to understand the sacred\r\nwords of progress, of people, of free brotherhood, but incapable of\r\nmaking himself their interpreter; fearful of the consequences, and\r\ntrembling like one who feels himself insecure, lest he should see the\r\npeople, raised to a new consciousness of its own faculties and of its\r\nown rights, question the authority of the pontificate--Pius IX.\r\nvacillated contemptibly between the two paths presented to him, muttered\r\nwords of emancipation, which he neither knew how nor intended to make\r\ngood, and promises of country and independence to Italy which his\r\nfollowers betrayed by conspiring with Austria. Then, struck with sudden\r\nterror, he fled before the multitudes who cried aloud to him _courage;_\r\nhe sheltered himself under the protection of a Prince whom he\r\ndespised--the executioner of his subjects; he imbibed his tendencies,\r\nand in order to revenge himself for the quiet with which Rome, provoked\r\nin vain to a civil war, was organizing a new government, he solicited\r\nforeign aid; and he who had, from a horror of bloodshed, shortly before\r\nendeavored to withdraw Roman assistance from the Lombard struggle,\r\nagreed that French, Austrian, Neapolitan, and Spanish bayonets should\r\nrebuild his throne. He now wanders amidst the fallacies of secret\r\nprotocols, the servant of his protectors, the servant of all except of\r\nduty and of the wish of those who hoped in him, turning to the frontiers\r\nof Rome and yet not expecting to re-enter there, and as if kept back by\r\nthe phantoms of the slain. The Louis XVI. of Papacy, he has destroyed it\r\nfor ever. The cannon ball of his allies discharged against the Vatican,\r\ngave the last blow to the institution.\r\n\r\nWhilst these things were happening, a Prince was pursuing in the north\r\nof our peninsula a similar course, accompanied by the same hopes, by the\r\nsame illusions and delusions of the people. He was saluted by the title\r\nof the _Sword of Italy_. The choicest spirits from all parts pointed out\r\nto him Austria and the Alps, and suspended, in order to make the last\r\ntrial of monarchy, the propagandism of their most cherished ideas. He\r\nwas preceded by the encouragement of all Europe, and followed by a\r\nnumerous and valiant army. Where died Charles Albert?\r\n\r\nThus has Providence shown to our people, desirous of the right, but\r\nlukewarm in faith and too credulous in the illusions of the old world,\r\nthe powerlessness of monarchy to insure the safety of Italy, and the\r\nirreconcilability of papacy with the free progress of humanity. The\r\ndualism of the middle ages is henceforward a mere form without life or\r\nsoul; the Guelph and Ghibelline insignia are now those of the tomb.\r\nNeither Pope, nor King! God and the people only shall henceforth\r\ndisclose to us the regions of the future.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFuture times--nay the present will do ample justice to Mazzini, as well\r\nas to Pio Nono. In the first will be frankly recognized one of those\r\niron men who are able to beard tyranny and profligacy even while they\r\nstand alone, the apostles of reformation, the originators and heralds of\r\nafter change. In the other--but the words just quoted anticipate as it\r\nseems to us, and in no ungenerous spirit, the verdict and language of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[27] Royalty and Republicanism in Italy; or Notes and Documents relating\r\nto the Lombard Insurrection, and to the Royal War of 1848.

To say nothing of the siege of Reading, which more even\r\nthan the vandalism of the Reformation completed the destruction of that\r\nnoble abbey, the third in rank and size in England, with its magnificent\r\nchurch, its cloisters, and its halls, covering thirty acres of\r\nbuildings,--and such buildings! within the outer courts;--to say nothing\r\nof that most reckless barbarity just at our door--we in our little\r\nvillage of Aberleigh lie between Basting-House to the south, whose\r\ndesperately defended walls offer little more now than a mere site,--and\r\nDonnington to the west, where the ruined Gatehouse upon the hill alone\r\nremains of that strong fortress, which overlooked the well-contested\r\nfield of Newbury,--and Chalgrove to the north, where the reaper, as he\r\nbinds his sheaf, still pauses to tell you the very place where Hampden\r\nfell; every spot has a history! Look at a wooden spire, and your\r\ncompanion shakes his head, and says that it has been so ever since the\r\nCavaliers were blown up in the church tower! Ask the history of a\r\ncrumbling wall, and the answer is pretty sure to be, Cromwell! That his\r\nHighness the Lord Protector did leave what an accomplished friend of\r\nmine calls \"his peculiar impressions\" upon a great many places in our\r\nneighborhood is pretty certain; on so many, that there is no actual or\r\nauthentic catalogue of all; and in some cases there is nothing but\r\ngeneral tradition, and the nature of the \"impressions\" in question, to\r\nvouch for the fact of their destruction at that period.\r\n\r\nAmongst these, one of the edifices that must have been best worth\r\npreserving, and is even now most interesting to see, is the grand old\r\ncastellated mansion, which in the reign of Elizabeth belonged to one of\r\nher favorite courtiers, and was known as Master Comptroller's House, at\r\nGrays.\r\n\r\nThe very road to it is singularly interesting. Passing through the town,\r\nwhich increases in growth every day, until one wonders when and where it\r\nwill stop, and looking with ever fresh admiration at the beautiful\r\nlacework window of the old Friary, which I long to see preserved in the\r\nfitliest manner, by forming again the chief ornament of a church, and\r\nthen driving under the arch of the Great Western Railway, and feeling\r\nthe strange vibration of some monster train passing over our heads,--a\r\nproceeding which never fails to make my pony show off his choicest airs\r\nand graces, pricking up his pretty ears, tossing his slender head,\r\ndancing upon four feet, and sometimes rearing upon two,--we arrive at\r\nthe long, low, picturesque old bridge, the oldest of all the bridges\r\nthat cross the Thames, so narrow that no two vehicles can pass at once,\r\nand that over every pier triangular spaces have been devised for the\r\nsafety of foot passengers. On the centre arch is a fisherman's hut,\r\noccupying the place once filled by a friar's cell, and covering a still\r\nexisting chapel, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, now put to secular\r\nuses--a dairy or a cellar.\r\n\r\nA little way down the river is one of the beautiful islands of the\r\nThames, now a smooth and verdant meadow, edged round with old willow\r\npollards calmly reflected in the bright, clear waters, but giving back\r\nin the twelfth century a far different scene. Here was fought a wager of\r\nbattle between Robert de Montford, appellant, and Henry de Essex,\r\nhereditary Standard-bearer of the kings of England, defendant, by\r\ncommand, and in the presence of Henry the Second. The story is told very\r\nminutely and graphically by Stowe. Robert de Montford at length struck\r\ndown his adversary, \"who fell,\" says the old historian, \"after receiving\r\nmany wounds; and the King, at the request of several noblemen, his\r\nrelations, gave permission to the monks to inter the body, commanding\r\nthat no further violence should be offered to it. The monks took up the\r\nvanquished knight, and carried him into the abbey, where he revived.\r\nWhen he recovered from his wounds, he was received into the community,\r\nand assumed the habit of the order, his lands being forfeited to the\r\nKing.\" I have always thought that this story would afford excellent\r\nscope to some great novelist, who might give a fair and accurate picture\r\nof monastic life, and, indeed, of the monastic orders, as landlords,\r\nneighbors, teachers, priests, without any mixture of controversial\r\ntheology, or inventing any predecessors of Luther or Wicliffe. How we\r\nshould have liked to have heard all about \"The Monastery,\" about the\r\n\"Abbot\" and Father Eustace, untroubled by Henry Warden or John Knox!\r\nFrom the moment that they appear, our comfort in the book vanishes, just\r\nas completely as that of the good easy Abbot Boniface himself. There we\r\nare in the middle of vexed questions, with the beautiful pile of Melrose\r\nthreatening every moment to fall about our ears!\r\n\r\nOur business now, however, is to get over the bridge, which after the\r\nexcitement of one dispute with a pugnacious carrier, and another with a\r\nsaucy groom, whose caracoling horse had well nigh leaped over the\r\nparapets on either side; after some backing of other carriages, and some\r\ndanger of being forced back to our own, we at last achieve, and enter\r\nunscathed, the pleasant village of Caversham.\r\n\r\nTo the left, through a highly ornamented lodge, lies the road to the\r\nancient seat of the Blounts, another house made famous by Pope, where\r\nthe fair ladies of his love, the sisters Martha and Teresa, lived and\r\ndied. A fine old place it is; and a picturesque road leads to it,\r\nwinding through a tract called the Warren, between the high\r\nchalk-cliffs, clothed with trees of all varieties, that for so many\r\nmiles fence in the northern side of the Thames, and the lordly river\r\nitself, now concealed by tall elms, now open and shining in the full\r\nlight of the summer sun. There is not such a flower bank in Oxfordshire\r\nas Caversham Warren.\r\n\r\nOur way, however, leads straight on. A few miles further, and a turn to\r\nthe right conducts us to one of the grand old village churches, which\r\ngive so much of character to English landscape. A large and beautiful\r\npile it is. The tower half clothed with ivy, standing with its charming\r\nvicarage and its pretty vicarage-garden on a high eminence, overhanging\r\none of the finest bends of the great river. A woody lane leads from the\r\nchurch to the bottom of the chalk-cliff, one side of which stands out\r\nfrom the road below, like a promontory, surmounted by the laurel hedges\r\nand flowery arbors of the vicarage-garden, and crested by a noble cedar\r\nof Lebanon. This is Shiplake church, famed far and near for its\r\nmagnificent oak carving, and the rich painted glass of its windows,\r\ncollected, long before such adornments were fashionable, by the fine\r\ntaste of the late vicar, and therefore filled with the very choicest\r\nspecimens of mediaeval art, chiefly obtained from the remains of the\r\ncelebrated Abbey of St. Bertin, near St. Omers, sacked during the first\r\nFrench Revolution. In this church Alfred Tennyson was married. Blessings\r\nbe upon him! I never saw the great Poet in my life, but thousands who\r\nnever may have seen him either, but who owe to his poetry the purest and\r\nrichest intellectual enjoyment, will echo and re-echo the benison.\r\n\r\nA little way farther, and a turn to the left leads to another spot\r\nconsecrated by genius,--Woodcot, where Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton passed\r\nthe earlier years of his married life, and wrote several of his most\r\npowerful novels. I have always thought that the scenery of Paul Clifford\r\ncaught some of its tone from that wild and beautiful country, for wild\r\nand beautiful it is. The terrace in the grounds commands a most\r\nextensive prospect; and beneath a clump of trees on the common behind\r\nthe house, is the only spot where on a clear day Windsor may be seen on\r\none side, and Oxford on the other,--looking almost like the domes, and\r\ntowers, and pinnacles that sometimes appear in the clouds--a fairy\r\npicture that the next breeze may waft away! This beautiful residence\r\nstands so high, that one of its former possessors, Admiral Fraser\r\n(grandfather to that dear friend of mine who is the present owner),\r\ncould discover Woodcot Clump from the mast of his own ship at Spithead,\r\na distance of sixty miles.\r\n\r\nWyfold's Court, another pretty place a little farther on, which also\r\nbelonged once to a most dear friend, possesses the finest Wych-elms in\r\nEngland. Artists come from far and near to paint these stately trees,\r\nwhose down-dropping branches and magnificent height are at once so\r\ngraceful and so rich. They are said always to indicate ecclesiastical\r\npossession, but no trace of such dependency is to be found in the\r\ntitle-deeds, or in the tenure by which in feudal times the lands were\r\nheld,--that of presenting a rose to the King, should he pass by a\r\ncertain road on a May-day.\r\n\r\nAnd now we approach Rotherfield Grays,--its bowery lanes, its wild\r\nrugged commons, and its vast beech woods, from the edge of which\r\nprojects every here and there a huge cherry-tree, looking, in the\r\nblossoming springtime, as if carved in ivory, so exquisite is the\r\nwhiteness, casting upon the ferny-turf underneath showers of snowy\r\npetals that blanch the very ground, and diffusing around an almond-like\r\nodor, that mingles with the springing thyme and the flowering gorse, and\r\nloads the very air with heavy balm.\r\n\r\nExquisite is the pleasantness of these beech woods, where the light is\r\ngreen from the silky verdure of the young leaves, and where the mossy\r\nwood-paths are embroidered with thousands of flowers, from the earliest\r\nviolet and primrose, the wood-anemone, the wood-sorrel, the daffodil,\r\nand the wild hyacinth of spring, to the wood-vetch, the woodroof, the\r\ncampanulas, and the orchises of summer;--for all the English orchises\r\nare here: that which so curiously imitates the dead oak leaf, that again\r\nwhich imitates the human figure; the commonest but most pretty bee\r\norchis, and the parallel ones which are called after the spider, the\r\nfrog, and the fly. Strange freak of nature this, in a lower order of\r\ncreation, to mimic her own handyworks in a higher!--to mimic even our\r\nhuman mimicry!--for that which is called the man orchis is most like the\r\nimitation of a human figure that a child might cut from colored paper.\r\nStrange, strange mimicry! but full of variety, full of beauty, full of\r\nodor. Of all the fragrant blossoms that haunt the woods, I know none so\r\nexquisite as that night-scented orchis which is called indifferently,\r\nthe butterfly or the lily of the valley. Another glory of these woods,\r\nan autumnal glory, is the whole fungus tribe, various and innumerable as\r\nthe mosses; from the sober drab-colored fungi, spotted with white, which\r\nso much resemble a sea-egg, to those whose deep and gorgeous hues would\r\nshame the tinting of an Indian shell. Truffles, too, are found beneath\r\nthe earth; and above it are deposited huge masses of the strange\r\ncompound called in modern geological phrase Agglomerate. Flint and\r\ncoral, and gravel, and attrited pebbles enter into the combination of\r\nthis extraordinary natural conglomeration, which no steel, however\r\nhardened, can separate, and which seems to have been imitated very\r\nsuccessfully by the old builders in their cements and the substances\r\nused in the filling up of their grandest structures, as may be seen in\r\nthe layers which unite the enormous slabs of granite in the Roman walls\r\nat Silchester, as well as in the works of the old monkish architects at\r\nReading Abbey. Another beauty of this country is to be found in the\r\nfields,--now of the deep-red clover, with its shining crimson tops, now\r\nof the gay and brilliant saintfoin (the holy hay), the bright pink of\r\nwhose flowery spikes gives to the ground the look of a bed of roses.\r\n\r\nAnd now we reach the gate that admits us down a steep descent to the\r\nRectory-house, a large substantial mansion, covered with Banksia roses,\r\nand finely placed upon a natural terrace,--a fertile valley below, and\r\nits own woods and orchard-trees above.\r\n\r\nMy friend the rector, raciest of men, is an Oxford divine of the old\r\nschool; a ripe scholar; one who has travelled wide and far, and is\r\nlearned in the tongues, the manners, and the literature of many nations;\r\nbut who is himself English to the backbone in person, thought, and\r\nfeeling. Orthodox is he, no doubt. Nowhere are church and schools, and\r\nparish visitings, better cared for; but he has a knack of attending also\r\nto the creature comforts of all about him, of calling beef and blankets\r\nin aid of his precepts, which has a wonderful effect in promoting their\r\nefficacy. Mansion and man are large alike, and alike overflowing with\r\nhospitality and kindliness. His original and poignant conversation is so\r\njoyous and good-humored, the making every body happy is so evidently his\r\npredominant taste, that the pungency only adds to the flavor of his\r\ntalk, and never casts a moment's shade over its sunny heartiness.\r\n\r\nRight opposite the Rectory terrace, framed like a picture by the rarest\r\nand stateliest trees, stands the object of my pilgrimage, Grays' Court,\r\na comparatively modern house, erected amongst the remains of a vast old\r\ncastellated mansion, belonging first to the noble family of Gray, who\r\ngave their name not merely to the manor, but to the district; then to\r\nthe house of Knollys; and latterly to the Stapletons, two venerable\r\nladies of that name being its present possessors.\r\n\r\nAll my life I had heard of Grays' Court; of the rich yet wild country in\r\nwhich it is placed; of the park so finely undulated, and so profusely\r\ncovered by magnificent timber; of the huge old towers which seem to\r\nguard and sentinel the present house; of the far extended walls, whose\r\nfoundations may yet be traced, in dry seasons, among the turf of the\r\nlawn; of the traditions which assign the demolition of those ancient\r\nwalls to the wars of the Commonwealth; and of the strange absence of all\r\ndocumentary evidence upon the subject.\r\n\r\nAnother cause for my strong desire to see this interesting place, is to\r\nbe found in its association with one of those historical personages in\r\nwhom I have always taken the warmest interest. Lord Essex (whose mother\r\nwas the famous Lettice Knollys, who had had for her second husband\r\nanother of Queen Elizabeth's favorites, Robert Dudley, Earl of\r\nLeicester), when confined in London, a prey to the tyranny of Elizabeth,\r\npetitioned, in one of those eloquent letters to the Virgin Queen which\r\nwill always remain amongst the earliest and finest specimens of English\r\nprose, to be allowed to repair, for the benefit of his health, \"to\r\nMaster Comptroller's house at Grays.\" Ah! we can fancy, when looking\r\nover this lovely valley, with its woods, its verdure, its sweep of\r\nhills, its feeling of the near river, we can well fancy how the\r\npoet-heart of the great Earl must have longed to leave the trial, the\r\nturmoil, the jangling, the treachery, the weary fears, the bitter\r\nhumiliations of his London captivity, and to taste once more the sweet\r\nair, the pleasant sights, the calmness and the quiet of the country.\r\nHope and comfort must have come with the thought. One of the prettiest\r\npictures that I know, is an extract from a contemporary letter, in the\r\nfirst volume of Mr. Craik's most interesting book, the \"Romance of the\r\nPeerage,\" telling of the Earl and Countess, during one of the daily\r\nvisits that she was at one time permitted to pay him when he was a\r\nprisoner in Essex House, walking together in the garden, \"now he, now\r\nshe, reading one to the other.\" The whole taste and feeling of the man,\r\nthe daily habit of his life, is shown in this little circumstance. And\r\nthis is the brave soldier who, when examined before the Privy Council, a\r\ncouncil composed of open enemies and treacherous friends, had been kept\r\nnearly all the day kneeling at the bottom of the table. Tyranny drove\r\nhim into madness, and then exacted the full penalty of the wild acts\r\nwhich that madness prompted. But Essex was a man in advance of his age;\r\nthe companion as well as the patron of poets; the protector of papist\r\nand puritan; the fearless asserter of liberty of conscience! He deserved\r\na truer friend than Bacon, a more merciful judge than Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nTo the house of Knollys belongs another interesting association, that\r\nstrangest of genealogical romances, the great case of the Banbury\r\npeerage. The cause was decided (if decided it can be called even now) by\r\nevidence found in the parish register of Rotherfield Grays.\r\n\r\nThe place has yet another attraction in its difficulty of access; the\r\nexcellent ladies of the Court admitting few beyond their own immediate\r\nconnections and nearest friends. One class, to be sure, finds its way\r\nthere as if by instinct--the poor, who, as the birds of the air detect\r\nthe grain under the surface in the newly sown ground, are sure to find\r\nout the soil where charity lies germinating. Few excepting these\r\nconstant visitors are admitted. But, besides the powerful introduction\r\nof our mutual friend the rector, a nephew of theirs, and his most sweet\r\nand interesting wife, had for some time inhabited the house which had\r\nbeen the home of my own youth, so that my name was not strange to them;\r\nand they had the kindness to allow me to walk over their beautiful\r\ngrounds and gardens, to see their charming Swiss dairy, with its marbles\r\nand its china, and, above all, to satisfy my curiosity by looking over\r\nthe towers which still remain of the old castle,--piles whose prodigious\r\nthickness of wall and distance from each other give token of the immense\r\nextent and importance of the place. It is said to have been built round\r\ntwo courts. Alnwick and Windsor rose to my thoughts as I contemplated\r\nthese gigantic remains, and calculated the space that the original\r\nedifice must have covered. One of these towers is still occupied by the\r\nwell of the castle, a well three hundred feet deep, which supplies the\r\nfamily with water. It will give some idea of the scale of the old\r\nmansion, to say that the wheel by which the water is raised, is\r\ntwenty-five feet in diameter. Two donkeys are employed in the operation.\r\nOne donkey suffices for the parallel but much smaller well at\r\nCarisbrook, where the animal is so accustomed to be put in for the mere\r\npurpose of exhibiting the way in which the water is raised to the\r\nvisitors who go to look at the poor king's last prison, that he just\r\nmakes the one turn necessary to show the working of the machine, and\r\nthen stops of his own accord. The donkeys at Grays, kept for use and not\r\nfor show, have not had a similar opportunity of displaying their\r\nsagacity.\r\n\r\nOne cannot look at the place without a feeling of adaptedness. It is the\r\nvery spot for a stronghold of the Cavaliers: a spot where Lovelace and\r\nMontrose might each have fought and each have sung, defending it to the\r\nlast loaf of bread and the last charge of powder, and yielding at last\r\nto the irresistible force of Cromwell's cannonade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From the Keepsake for 1851.]\r\n\r\nSTANZAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Come not, when I am dead,\r\n      To drop thy foolish tears upon my grave,\r\n    To trample round my fallen head,\r\n      And vex the unhappy dust thou wouldst not save.\r\n    There let the wind sweep, and the plover cry;\r\n          But go thou by.\r\n\r\n    Child, if it were thine error or thy crime\r\n      I care no longer, being all unblest;\r\n    Wed whom thou wilt; but I am sick of time,\r\n      And I desire to rest.\r\n    Pass on, weak heart, and leave me where I lie.\r\n          Go by--go by!\r\n\r\n    ALFRED TENNYSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Blackwood's Magazine.]\r\n\r\nMY NOVEL:\r\n\r\nOR, VARIETIES IN ENGLISH LIFE.\r\n\r\nBY PISISTRATUS CAXTON.\r\n\r\n_Continued from page 120._\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.--CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all his Machiavellian wisdom, Dr. Riccabocca had been foiled\r\nin his attempt to seduce Leonard Fairfield into his service, even though\r\nhe succeeded in partially winning over the widow to his views. For to\r\nher he represented the worldly advantages of the thing. Lenny would\r\nlearn to be fit for more than a day-laborer; he would learn gardening,\r\nin all its branches--rise some day to be a head gardener. \"And,\" said\r\nRiccabocca, \"I will take care of his book learning, and teach him\r\nwhatever he has a head for.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has a head for every thing,\" said the widow.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the wise man, \"every thing shall go into it.\"\r\n\r\nThe widow was certainly dazzled; for, as we have seen, she highly prized\r\nscholarly distinction, and she knew that the parson looked upon\r\nRiccabocca as a wondrous learned man. But still, Riccabocca was said to\r\nbe a Papist, and suspected to be a conjuror. Her scruples on both these\r\npoints, the Italian, who was an adept in the art of talking over the\r\nfair sex, would no doubt have dissipated, if there had been any use in\r\nit; but Lenny put a dead stop to all negotiations. He had taken a mortal\r\ndislike to Riccabocca; he was very much frightened by him--and the\r\nspectacles, the pipe, the cloak, the long hair, and the red umbrella;\r\nand said so sturdily, in reply to every overture, \"Please, sir, I'd\r\nrather not; I'd rather stay along with mother\"--that Riccabocca was\r\nforced to suspend all further experiments in his Machiavellian\r\ndiplomacy. He was not at all cast down, however, by his first failure;\r\non the contrary, he was one of those men whom opposition stimulates. And\r\nwhat before had been but a suggestion of prudence, became an object of\r\ndesire. Plenty of other lads might no doubt be had, on as reasonable\r\nterms as Lenny Fairfield; but the moment Lenny presumed to baffle the\r\nItalian's designs upon him, the special acquisition of Lenny became of\r\nparamount importance in the eyes of Signor Riccabocca.\r\n\r\nJackeymo, however, lost all his interest in the traps, snares, and gins\r\nwhich his master proposed to lay for Leonard Fairfield, in the more\r\nimmediate surprise that awaited him on learning that Dr. Riccabocca had\r\naccepted an invitation to pass a few days at the Hall.\r\n\r\n\"There will be no one there but the family,\" said Riccabocca. \"Poor\r\nGiacomo, a little chat in the servants' hall will do you good: and the\r\nsquire's beef is more nourishing, after all, than the sticklebacks and\r\nminnows. It will lengthen your life.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Padrone jests,\" said Jackeymo, statelily, \"as if any one could\r\nstarve in his service.\"\r\n\r\n\"Um,\" said Riccabocca. \"At least, faithful friend, you have tried that\r\nexperiment as far as human nature will permit;\" and he extended his hand\r\nto his fellow-exile with that familiarity which exists between servant\r\nand master in the usages of the continent. Jackeymo bent low, and a tear\r\nfell upon the hand he kissed.\r\n\r\n\"_Cospetto!_\" said Dr. Riccabocca, \"a thousand mock pearls do not make\r\nup the cost of a single true one! The tears of women, we know their\r\nworth; but the tear of an honest man--fie, Giacomo!--at least I can\r\nnever repay you this! Go and see to our wardrobe.\"\r\n\r\nSo far as his master's wardrobe was concerned, that order was pleasing\r\nto Jackeymo; for the Doctor had in his drawers suits which Jackeymo\r\npronounced to be as good as new, though many a long year had passed\r\nsince they left the tailor's hands. But when Jackeymo came to examine\r\nthe state of his own clothing department, his face grew considerably\r\nlonger. It was not that he was without other clothes than those on his\r\nback--quantity was there, but the quality! Mournfully he gazed on two\r\nsuits, complete in the three separate members of which man's raiments\r\nare composed: the one suit extended at length upon his bed, like a\r\nveteran stretched by pious hands after death; the other brought\r\npiecemeal to the invidious light--the _torso_ placed upon a chair, the\r\nlimbs dangling down from Jackeymo's melancholy arm. No bodies long\r\nexposed at the Morgue could evince less sign of resuscitation than those\r\nrespectable defuncts. For, indeed, Jackeymo had been less thrifty of his\r\napparel--more _profusus sui_--than his master. In the earliest days of\r\ntheir exile, he preserved the decorous habit of dressing for dinner--it\r\nwas a respect due to the Padrone--and that habit had lasted till the two\r\nhabits on which it necessarily depended had evinced the first symptoms\r\nof decay; then the evening clothes had been taken into morning wear, in\r\nwhich hard service they had breathed their last.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, notwithstanding his general philosophical abstraction from\r\nsuch household details, had more than once said, rather in pity to\r\nJackeymo, than with an eye to that respectability which the costume of\r\nthe servant reflects on the dignity of the master, \"Giacomo, thou\r\nwantest clothes; fit thyself out of mine!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Jackeymo had bowed his gratitude, as if the donation had been\r\naccepted; but the fact was, that that same fitting out was easier said\r\nthan done. For though--thanks to an existence mainly upon sticklebacks\r\nand minnows--both Jackeymo and Riccabocca at that state which the\r\nlongevity of misers proves to be most healthful to the human frame,\r\nviz., skin and bone--yet, the bones contained in the skin of Riccabocca\r\nall took longitudinal directions; while those in the skin of Jackeymo\r\nspread out latitudinally. And you might as well have made the bark of a\r\nLombardy poplar serve for the trunk of some dwarfed and pollarded oak,\r\nin whose hollow the Babes of the Wood could have slept at their ease, as\r\nhave fitted out Jackeymo from the garb of Riccabocca. Moreover, if the\r\nskill of the tailor could have accomplished that undertaking, the\r\nfaithful Jackeymo would never have had the heart to avail himself of the\r\ngenerosity of his master. He had a sort of religious sentiment too,\r\nabout those vestments of the Padrone. The ancients, we know, when\r\nescaping from shipwreck, suspended in the votive temple the garments in\r\nwhich they had struggled through the wave. Jackeymo looked on those\r\nrelics of the past with a kindred superstition. \"This coat the Padrone\r\nwore on such an occasion. I remember the very evening the Padrone last\r\nput on those pantaloons!\" And coat and pantaloons were tenderly dusted,\r\nand carefully restored to their sacred rest.\r\n\r\nBut now, after all, what was to be done? Jackeymo was much too proud to\r\nexhibit his person, to the eyes of the Squire's butler, in habiliments\r\ndiscreditable to himself and the Padrone. In the midst of his perplexity\r\nthe bell rang, and he went down into the parlor.\r\n\r\nRiccabocca was standing on the hearth, under his symbolical\r\nrepresentation of the \"Patriae Exul.\"\r\n\r\n\"Giacomo,\" quoth he, \"I have been thinking that thou hast never done\r\nwhat I told thee, and fitted thyself out from my superfluities. But we\r\nare going now into the great world; visiting once begun, Heaven knows\r\nwhere it may stop! Go to the nearest town and get thyself clothes.\r\nThings are dear in England. Will this suffice?\" And Riccabocca extended\r\na L5 note.\r\n\r\nJackeymo, we have seen, was more familiar with his master than we formal\r\nEnglish permit our domestics to be with us. But in his familiarity he\r\nwas usually respectful. This time, however, respect deserted him.\r\n\r\n\"The Padrone is mad!\" he exclaimed; \"he would fling away his whole\r\nfortune if I would let him. Five pounds English, or a hundred and\r\ntwenty-six pounds Milanese![28] Santa Maria! Unnatural Father! And what\r\nis to become of the poor Signorina? Is this the way you are to marry her\r\nin the foreign land?\"\r\n\r\n\"Giacomo,\" said Riccabocca, bowing his head to the storm, \"the Signorina\r\nto-morrow; to-day, the honor of the house. Thy small-clothes, Giacomo.\r\nMiserable man, thy small-clothes!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is just,\" said Jackeymo, recovering himself, and with humility; \"and\r\nthe Padrone does right to blame me, but not in so cruel a way. It is\r\njust--the Padrone lodges and boards me, and gives me handsome wages, and\r\nhe has a right to expect that I should not go in this figure.\"\r\n\r\n\"For the board and the lodgment, good,\" said Riccabocca. \"For the\r\nhandsome wages, they are the visions of thy fancy!\"\r\n\r\n\"They are no such thing,\" said Jackeymo, \"they are only in arrear. As if\r\nthe Padrone could not pay them some day or other--as if I was demeaning\r\nmyself by serving a master who did not intend to pay his servants! And\r\ncan't I wait? Have I not my savings, too? But be cheered, be cheered;\r\nyou shall be contented with me. I have two beautiful suits still. I was\r\narranging them when you rang for me. You shall see, you shall see.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Jackeymo hurried from the room, hurried back into his own chamber,\r\nunlocked a little trunk which he kept at his bed head, tossed out a\r\nvariety of small articles, and from the deepest depth extracted a\r\nleathern purse. He emptied the contents on the bed. They were chiefly\r\nItalian coins, some five-franc pieces, a silver medallion inclosing a\r\nlittle image of his patron saint--San Giacomo--one solid English guinea,\r\nand two or three pounds' worth in English silver. Jackeymo put back the\r\nforeign coins, saying prudently, \"One will lose on them here;\" he seized\r\nthe English coins and counted them out. \"But are you enough, you\r\nrascals?\" quoth he angrily, giving them a good shake. His eye caught\r\nsight of the medallion--he paused; and after eyeing the tiny\r\nrepresentation of the saint with great deliberation, he added, in a\r\nsentence which he must have picked up from the proverbial aphorisms of\r\nhis master:\r\n\r\n\"What's the difference between the enemy who does not hurt me, and the\r\nfriend who does not serve me? _Monsignore San Giacomo_, my patron saint,\r\nyou are of very little use to me in the leathern bag. But if you help me\r\nto get into a new pair of small-clothes on this important occasion, you\r\nwill be a friend indeed. _Alla bisogna, Monsignore_.\" Then, gravely\r\nkissing the medallion, he thrust it into one pocket, the coins into the\r\nother, made up a bundle of the two defunct suits, and, muttering to\r\nhimself, \"Beast, miser that I am, to disgrace the Padrone, with all\r\nthese savings in his service!\" ran down stairs into his pantry, caught\r\nup his hat and stick, and in a few moments more was seen trudging off to\r\nthe neighboring town of L----.\r\n\r\nApparently the poor Italian succeeded, for he came back that evening in\r\ntime to prepare the thin gruel which made his master's supper, with a\r\nsuit of black--a little threadbare, but still highly respectable--two\r\nshirt fronts, and two white cravats. But, out of all this finery,\r\nJackeymo held the small-clothes in especial veneration; for as they had\r\ncost exactly what the medallion had sold for, so it seemed to him that\r\nSan Giacomo had heard his prayer in that quarter to which he had more\r\nexclusively directed the saint's attention. The other habiliments came\r\nto him in the merely human process of sale and barter; the small-clothes\r\nwere the personal gratuity of San Giacomo!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nLife has been subjected to many ingenious comparisons: and if we do not\r\nunderstand it any better, it is not for want of what is called\r\n\"reasoning by illustration.\" Amongst other resemblances, there are\r\nmoments when, to a quiet contemplator, it suggests the image of one of\r\nthose rotatory entertainments commonly seen in fairs, and known by the\r\nname of \"whirligigs or roundabouts,\" in which each participator of the\r\npastime, seated on his hobby, is always apparently in the act of\r\npursuing some one before him, while he is pursued by some one behind.\r\nMan, and woman too, are naturally animals of chase; the greatest still\r\nfinds something to follow, and there is no one too humble not to be an\r\nobject of prey to another. Thus, confining our view to the village of\r\nHazeldean, we behold in this whirligig Dr. Riccabocca spurring his hobby\r\nafter Lenny Fairfield; and Miss Jemima, on her decorous side-saddle,\r\nwhipping after Dr. Riccabocca. Why, with so long and intimate a\r\nconviction of the villany of our sex, Miss Jemima should resolve upon\r\ngiving the male animal one more chance of redeeming itself in her eyes,\r\nI leave to the explanation of those gentlemen who profess to find \"their\r\nonly books in woman's looks.\" Perhaps it might be from the\r\nover-tenderness and clemency of Miss Jemima's nature; perhaps it might\r\nbe that, as yet, she had only experienced the villany of man born and\r\nreared in those cold northern climates; and in the land of Petrarch and\r\nRomeo, of the citron and myrtle, there was reason to expect that the\r\nnative monster would be more amenable to gentle influences, less\r\nobstinately hardened in his iniquities. Without entering farther into\r\nthese hypotheses, it is sufficient to say, that on Signor Riccabocca's\r\nappearance in the drawing-room, at Hazeldean, Miss Jemima felt more than\r\never rejoiced that she had relaxed in his favor her general hostility to\r\nman. In truth, though Frank saw something quizzical in the old-fashioned\r\nand outlandish cut of the Italian's sober dress; in his long hair, and\r\nthe _chapeau bras_, over which he bowed so gracefully, and then pressed\r\nit, as if to his heart, before tucking it under his arm, after the\r\nfashion in which the gizzard reposes under the wing of a roasted pullet;\r\nyet it was impossible that even Frank could deny to Riccabocca that\r\npraise which is due to the air and manner of an unmistakable gentleman.\r\nAnd certainly as, after dinner, conversation grew more familiar, and the\r\nParson and Mrs. Dale, who had been invited to meet their friend, did\r\ntheir best to draw him out, his talk, though sometimes a little too wise\r\nfor his listeners, became eminently animated and agreeable. It was the\r\nconversation of a man who, besides the knowledge which is acquired from\r\nbooks and life, had studied the art which becomes a gentleman--that of\r\npleasing in polite society. Riccabocca, however, had more than this\r\nart--he had one which is often less innocent,--the art of penetrating\r\ninto the weak side of his associates, and of saying the exact thing\r\nwhich hits it plump in the middle, with the careless air of a random\r\nshot.\r\n\r\nThe result was, that all were charmed with him; and that even Captain\r\nBarnabas postponed the whist-table for a full hour after the usual\r\ntime. The Doctor did not play--he thus became the property of the two\r\nladies, Miss Jemima and Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\nSeated between the two, in the place rightfully appertaining to Flimsey,\r\nwho this time was fairly dislodged, to her great wonder and discontent,\r\nthe Doctor was the emblem of true Domestic Felicity, placed between\r\nFriendship and Love.\r\n\r\nFriendship, as became her, worked quietly at the embroidered\r\npocket-handkerchief, and left Love to its more animated operations. \"You\r\nmust be very lonely at the Casino,\" said Love, in a sympathizing tone.\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" replied Riccabocca, gallantly, \"I shall think so when I leave\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nFriendship cast a sly glance at Love--Love blushed or looked down on the\r\ncarpet, which comes to the same thing. \"Yet,\" began Love again--\"yet\r\nsolitude, to a feeling heart--\"\r\n\r\nRiccabocca thought of the note of invitation, and involuntarily buttoned\r\nhis coat, as if to protect the individual organ thus alarmingly referred\r\nto.\r\n\r\n\"Solitude, to a feeling heart, has its charms. It is so hard even for\r\nus, poor ignorant women, to find a congenial companion--but for _you_!\"\r\nLove stopped short, as if it had said too much, and smelt confusedly at\r\nits boquet.\r\n\r\nDr. Riccabocca cautiously lowered his spectacles, and darted one glance,\r\nwhich, with the rapidity and comprehensiveness of lightning, seemed to\r\nenvelope and take in it, as it were, the whole inventory of Miss\r\nJemima's personal attractions. Now, Miss Jemima, as I have before\r\nobserved, had a mild and pensive expression of countenance, and she\r\nwould have been positively pretty had the mildness looked a little more\r\nalert, and the pensiveness somewhat less lackadaisical. In fact, though\r\nMiss Jemima was constitutionally mild, she was not _de natura_ pensive;\r\nshe had too much of the Hazeldean blood in her veins for that sullen and\r\nviscid humor called melancholy, and therefore this assumption of\r\npensiveness really spoilt her character of features, which only wanted\r\nto be lighted up by a cheerful smile to be extremely prepossessing. The\r\nsame remark might apply to the figure, which--thanks to the same\r\npensiveness--lost all the undulating grace which movement and animation\r\nbestow on the fluent curves of the feminine form. The figure was a good\r\nfigure, examined in detail--a little thin, perhaps, but by no means\r\nemaciated--with just and elegant proportions, and naturally light and\r\nflexible. But that same unfortunate pensiveness gave the whole a\r\ncharacter of inertness and languor; and when Miss Jemima reclined on the\r\nsofa, so complete seemed the relaxation of nerve and muscle, that you\r\nwould have thought she had lost the use of her limbs. Over her face and\r\nform, thus defrauded of the charms Providence had bestowed on them, Dr.\r\nRiccabocca's eye glanced rapidly; and then moving nearer to Mrs.\r\nDale--\"Defend me\" (he stopped a moment, and added,) \"from the charge of\r\nnot being able to appreciate congenial companionship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I did not say that!\" cried Miss Jemima.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me,\" said the Italian, \"if I am so dull as to misunderstand you.\r\nOne may well lose one's head, at least, in such a neighborhood as this.\"\r\nHe rose as he spoke, and bent over Frank's shoulder to examine some\r\nViews of Italy, which Miss Jemima (with what, if wholly unselfish, would\r\nhave been an attention truly delicate) had extracted from the library in\r\norder to gratify the guest.\r\n\r\n\"Most interesting creature, indeed,\" sighed Miss Jemima, \"but too--too\r\nflattering!\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" said Mrs. Dale gravely, \"do you think, love, that you could\r\nput off the end of the world a little longer, or must we make haste in\r\norder to be in time?\"\r\n\r\n\"How wicked you are!\" said Miss Jemima, turning aside.\r\n\r\nSome few minutes afterwards, Mrs. Dale contrived it so that Dr.\r\nRiccabocca and herself were in a farther corner of the room, looking at\r\na picture said to be by Wouvermans.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Dale._--\"She is very amiable, Jemima, is she not?\"\r\n\r\n_Riccabocca._--\"Exceedingly so. Very fine battle-piece!\"\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Dale._--\"So kind-hearted.\"\r\n\r\n_Riccabocca._--\"All ladies are. How naturally that warrior makes his\r\ndesperate cut at the runaway!\"\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Dale._--\"She is not what is called regularly handsome, but she has\r\nsomething very winning.\"\r\n\r\n_Riccabocca_, with a smile.--\"So winning, that it is strange she is not\r\nwon. That gray mare in the foreground stands out very boldly!\"\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Dale_, distrusting the smile of Riccabocca, and throwing in a more\r\neffective grape charge.--\"Not won yet; and it _is_ strange!--she will\r\nhave a very pretty fortune.\"\r\n\r\n_Riccabocca._--\"Ah!\"\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Dale._--\"Six thousand pounds, I dare say--certainly four.\"\r\n\r\n_Riccabocca_, suppressing a sigh, and with his wonted address.--\"If Mrs.\r\nDale were still single, she would never need a friend to say what her\r\nportion might be; but Miss Jemima is so good that I am quite sure it is\r\nnot Miss Jemima's fault that she is still--Miss Jemima!\"\r\n\r\nThe foreigner slipped away as he spoke, and sat himself down beside the\r\nwhist-players.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale was disappointed, but certainly not offended.--\"It would be\r\nsuch a good thing for both,\" muttered she, almost inaudibly.\r\n\r\n\"Giacomo,\" said Riccabocca, as he was undressing, that night, in the\r\nlarge, comfortable, well-carpeted English bedroom, with that great\r\nEnglish four-posted bed in the recess which seems made to shame folks\r\nout of single-blessedness--\"Giacomo, I have had this evening the offer\r\nof probably six thousand pounds--certainly of four thousand.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Cosa meravigliosa!_\" exclaimed Jackeymo--\"miraculous thing!\" and he\r\ncrossed himself with great fervor. \"Six thousand pounds English! why,\r\nthat must be a hundred thousand--blockhead that I am!--more than a\r\nhundred and fifty thousand pounds Milanese!\" And Jackeymo, who was\r\nconsiderably enlivened by the Squire's ale, commenced a series of\r\ngesticulations and capers, in the midst of which he stopped and cried,\r\n\"But not for nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing! no!\"\r\n\r\n\"These mercenary English!--the Government wants to bribe you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's not it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The priests want you to turn heretic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Worse than that,\" said the philosopher.\r\n\r\n\"Worse than that! O Padrone! for shame!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be a fool, but pull off my pantaloons--they want me never to wear\r\n_these_ again!\"\r\n\r\n\"Never to wear what!\" exclaimed Jackeymo, staring outright at his\r\nmaster's long legs in their linen drawers--\"never to wear--\"\r\n\r\n\"The breeches,\" said Riccabocca, laconically.\r\n\r\n\"The barbarians!\" faltered Jackeymo.\r\n\r\n\"My nightcap!--and never to have any comfort in this,\" said Riccabocca,\r\ndrawing the cotton head-gear; \"and never to have any sound sleep in\r\nthat,\" pointing to the four-posted bed. \"And to be a bondsmen and a\r\nslave,\" continued Riccabocca, waxing wroth; \"and to be wheedled and\r\npurred at, and pawed, and clawed, and scolded, and fondled, and blinded,\r\nand deafened, and bridled, and saddled--bedevilled and--married.\"\r\n\r\n\"Married!\" said Jackeymo, more dispassionately--\"that's very bad,\r\ncertainly; but more than a hundred and fifty thousand _lire_, and\r\nperhaps a pretty young lady, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Pretty young lady!\" growled Riccabocca, jumping into bed and drawing\r\nthe clothes fiercely over him. \"Put out the candle, and get along with\r\nyou--do, you villainous old incendiary!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nIt was not many days since the resurrection of those ill-omened stocks,\r\nand it was evident already to an ordinary observer, that something wrong\r\nhad got into the village. The peasants wore a sullen expression of\r\ncountenance; when the Squire passed, they took off their hats with more\r\nthan ordinary formality, but they did not return the same broad smile to\r\nhis quick, hearty \"Good day, my man.\" The women peered at him from the\r\nthreshold or the casement, but did not, as was their wont (at least the\r\nwont of the prettiest), take occasion to come out to catch his passing\r\ncompliment on their own good looks, or their tidy cottages. And the\r\nchildren, who used to play after work on the site of the old stocks, now\r\nshunned the place, and, indeed, seemed to cease play altogether.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, no man likes to build, or rebuild, a great public\r\nwork for nothing. Now that the Squire had resuscitated the stocks, and\r\nmade them so exceedingly handsome, it was natural that he should wish to\r\nput somebody into them. Moreover, his pride and self-esteem had been\r\nwounded by the Parson's opposition; and it would be a justification to\r\nhis own forethought, and a triumph over the Parson's understanding, if\r\nhe could satisfactorily and practically establish a proof that the\r\nstocks had not been repaired before they were wanted.\r\n\r\nTherefore, unconsciously to himself, there was something about the\r\nSquire more burly, and authoritative, and menacing, than heretofore. Old\r\nGaffer Solomons observed, \"that they had better moind well what they\r\nwere about, for that the Squire had a wicked look in the tail of his\r\neye--just as the dun bull had afore it tossed neighbor Barnes's little\r\nboy.\"\r\n\r\nFor two or three days these mute signs of something brewing in the\r\natmosphere had been rather noticeable than noticed, without any positive\r\novert act of tyranny on the one hand, or rebellion on the other. But on\r\nthe very Saturday night in which Dr. Riccabocca was installed in the\r\nfour-posted bed in the chintz chamber, the threatened revolution\r\ncommenced. In the dead of that night, personal outrage was committed on\r\nthe stocks. And on the Sunday morning, Mr. Stirn, who was the earliest\r\nriser in the parish, perceived, in going to the farmyard, that the knob\r\nof the column that flanked the board had been feloniously broken off;\r\nthat the four holes were bunged up with mud; and that some jacobinical\r\nvillain had carved, on the very centre of the flourish or scroll work,\r\n\"Dam the stoks!\" Mr. Stirn was much too vigilant a right-hand man, much\r\ntoo zealous a friend of law and order, not to regard such proceedings\r\nwith horror and alarm. And when the Squire came into his dressing-room\r\nat half-past seven, his butler (who fulfilled also the duties of valet)\r\ninformed him with a mysterious air, that Mr. Stirn had something \"very\r\nparticular to communicate, about a most howdacious midnight 'spiracy and\r\n'sault.\"\r\n\r\nThe Squire stared, and bade Mr. Stirn be admitted.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" cried the Squire, suspending the operation of stropping his\r\nrazor.\r\n\r\nMr. Stirn groaned.\r\n\r\n\"Well, man, what now!\"\r\n\r\n\"I never knowed such a thing in this here parish afore,\" began Mr.\r\nStirn, \"and I can only 'count for it by s'posing that them foreign\r\nPapishers have been semminating\"--\r\n\r\n\"Been what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Semminating\"--\r\n\r\n\"Dissemminating, you blockhead--disseminating what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn the stocks,\" began Mr. Stirn, plunging right _in medias res_, and\r\nby a fine use of one of the noblest figures of rhetoric.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Stirn!\" cried the Squire, reddening, \"did you say 'Damn the\r\nstocks?'--damn my new handsome pair of stocks!\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord forbid, sir; that's what _they_ say: that's what they have digged\r\non it with knives and daggers, and they have stuffed mud in its four\r\nholes, and broken the capital of the elewation.\"\r\n\r\nThe Squire took the napkin off his shoulder, laid down strop and razor;\r\nhe seated himself in his arm-chair majestically, crossed his legs, and,\r\nin a voice that affected tranquillity, said--\r\n\r\n\"Compose yourself, Stirn; you have a deposition to make, touching an\r\nassault upon--can I trust my senses?--upon my new stocks. Compose\r\nyourself--be calm. NOW! What the devil is come to the parish?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, sir, what indeed?\" replied Mr. Stirn: and then laying the\r\nforefinger of the right hand on the palm of the left, he narrated the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n\"And whom do you suspect? Be calm now, don't speak in a passion. You are\r\na witness, sir--a dispassionate, unprejudiced witness. Zounds and fury!\r\nthis is the most insolent, unprovoked, diabolical--but whom do you\r\nsuspect, I say?\"\r\n\r\nStirn twirled his hat, elevated his eyebrows, jerked his thumb over his\r\nshoulder, and whispered--\"I hear as how two Papishers slept at your\r\nhonor's last night.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, dolt! do you suppose Dr. Rickeybockey got out of his warm bed to\r\nbung up the holes in my new stocks?\"\r\n\r\n\"Noa; he's two cunning to do it himself, but he may have been\r\nsemminating. He's mighty thick with Parson Dale, and your honor knows as\r\nhow the Parson set his face agin the stocks. Wait a bit, sir--don't fly\r\nat me yet. There be a boy in this here parish\"--\r\n\r\n\"A boy!--ah fool, now you are nearer the mark. The Parson write 'Damn\r\nthe stocks,' indeed! What boy do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"And that boy be cockered up much by Mister Dale; and the Papishers went\r\nand sat with him and his mother a whole hour t'other day; and that boy\r\nis as deep as a well; and I seed him lurking about the place, and hiding\r\nhisself under the tree the day the stocks was put up--and that ere boy\r\nis Lenny Fairfield.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whew,\" said the Squire, whistling, \"you have not your usual senses\r\nabout you to-day, man. Lenny Fairfield--pattern boy of the village. Hold\r\nyour tongue. I dare say it is not done by any one in the parish, after\r\nall; some good-for-nothing vagrant--that cursed tinker, who goes about\r\nwith a very vicious donkey--whom, by the way, I caught picking thistles\r\nout of the very eyes of the old stocks! Shows how the tinker brings up\r\nhis donkeys! Well, keep a sharp look-out. To-day is Sunday; worst day of\r\nthe week, I'm sorry and ashamed to say, for rows and depredations.\r\nBetween the services, and after evening church, there are always idle\r\nfellows from all the neighboring country about, as you know too well.\r\nDepend on it, the real culprits will be found gathering round the\r\nstocks, and will betray themselves: have your eyes, ears, and wits about\r\nyou, and I've no doubt we shall come to the rights of the matter before\r\nthe day's out. And if we do,\" added the Squire, \"we'll make an example\r\nof the ruffian!\"\r\n\r\n\"In course,\" said Stirn; \"and if we don't find him, we must make an\r\nexample all the same. That's where it is, sir. That's why the stock's\r\nben't respected: they has not had an example yet--we wants an example.\"\r\n\r\n\"On my word, I believe that's very true; and the first idle fellow you\r\ncatch in any thing wrong we'll clap in, and keep him there for two hours\r\nat least.\"\r\n\r\n\"With the biggest pleasure, your honor--that's what it is.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Stirn, having now got what he considered a complete and\r\nunconditional authority over all the legs and wrists of Hazeldean\r\nparish, _quoad_ the stocks, took his departure.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\"Randal,\" said Mrs. Leslie, on this memorable Sunday--\"Randal, do you\r\nthink of going to Mr. Hazeldean's?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" answered Randal. \"Mr. Egerton does not object to it; and\r\nas I do not return to Eaton, I may have no other opportunity of seeing\r\nFrank for some time. I ought not to fail in respect to Mr. Egerton's\r\nnatural heir!\"\r\n\r\n\"Gracious me!\" cried Mrs. Leslie, who, like many women of her cast and\r\nkind, had a sort of worldliness in her notions, which she never evinced\r\nin her conduct--\"gracious me!--natural heir to the old Leslie property!\"\r\n\r\n\"He is Mr. Egerton's nephew, and,\" added Randal, ingenuously letting out\r\nhis thoughts, \"I am no relation to Mr. Egerton at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said poor Mrs. Leslie, with tears in her eyes, \"it would be a\r\nshame in the man, after paying your schooling and sending you to Oxford,\r\nand having you to stay with him in the holidays, if he did not mean any\r\nthing by it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any thing, mother--yes--but not the thing you suppose. No matter. It is\r\nenough that he has armed me for life, and I shall use the weapons as\r\nseems to me best.\"\r\n\r\nHere the dialogue was suspended, by the entrance of the other members of\r\nthe family, dressed for church.\r\n\r\n\"It can't be time for church! No! it can't!\" exclaimed Mrs. Leslie. She\r\nwas never in time for any thing.\r\n\r\n\"Last bell ringing,\" said Mr. Leslie, who, though a slow man, was\r\nmethodical and punctual. Mrs. Leslie made a frantic rush at the door,\r\nthe Montfydget blood being now in a blaze--whirled up the stairs--gained\r\nher room, tore her best bonnet from the peg, snatched her newest shawl\r\nfrom the drawers, crushed the bonnet on her head, flung the shawl on her\r\nshoulders, thrust a desperate pin into its folds, in order to conceal a\r\nbuttonless yawn in the body of her gown, and then flew back like a\r\nwhirlwind. Meanwhile the family were already out of doors, in waiting;\r\nand just as the bell ceased, the procession moved from the shabby house\r\nto the dilapidated church.\r\n\r\nThe church was a large one, but the congregation was small, and so was\r\nthe income of the Parson. It was a lay rectory, and the great tithes had\r\nbelonged to the Leslies, but they had been long since sold. The\r\nvicarage, still in their gift, might be worth a little more than L100 a\r\nyear. The present incumbent had nothing else to live upon. He was a good\r\nman, and not originally a stupid one; but penury and the anxious cares\r\nfor wife and family, combined with what may be called _solitary\r\nconfinement_ for the cultivated mind, when, amidst the two-legged\r\ncreatures round, it sees no other cultivated mind with which it can\r\nexchange an extra-parochial thought--had lulled him into a lazy\r\nmournfulness, which at times was very like imbecility. His income\r\nallowed him to do no good to the parish, whether in work, trade, or\r\ncharity; and thus he had no moral weight with the parishioners beyond\r\nthe example of his sinless life and such negative effect as might be\r\nproduced by his slumberous exhortations. Therefore his parishioners\r\ntroubled him very little; and but for the influence which in hours of\r\nMontfydget activity, Mrs. Leslie exercised over the most tractable--that\r\nis, the children and the aged--not half-a-dozen persons would have known\r\nor cared whether he shut up his church or not.\r\n\r\nBut our family were seated in state in their old seignorial pew, and Mr.\r\nDumdrum, with a nasal twang, went lugubriously through the prayers; and\r\nthe old people who could sin no more, and the children who had not yet\r\nlearned to sin, croaked forth responses that might have come from the\r\nchoral frogs in Aristophanes. And there was a long sermon _apropos_ to\r\nnothing which could possibly interest the congregation--being, in fact,\r\nsome controversial homily, which Mr. Dumdrum had composed and preached\r\nyears before. And when this discourse was over, there was a loud\r\nuniversal grunt, as if of release and thanksgiving, and a great clatter\r\nof shoes--and the old hobbled, and the young scrambled, to the church\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nImmediately after church, the Leslie family dined; and, as soon as\r\ndinner was over, Randal set out on his foot journey to Hazeldean Hall.\r\n\r\nDelicate and even feeble though his frame, he had the energy and\r\nquickness of movement which belongs to nervous temperaments; and he\r\ntasked the slow stride of a peasant, whom he took to serve him as a\r\nguide for the first two or three miles. Though Randal had not the\r\ngracious open manner with the poor which Frank inherited from his\r\nfather, he was still (despite many a secret hypocritical vice, at war\r\nwith the character of a gentleman) gentleman enough to have no churlish\r\npride to his inferiors. He talked little, but he suffered his guide to\r\ntalk; and the boor, who was the same whom Frank had accosted, indulged\r\nin eulogistic comments on that young gentleman's pony, from which he\r\ndiverged into some compliments on the young gentleman himself. Randal\r\ndrew his hat over his brows. There is a wonderful tact and fine breeding\r\nin your agricultural peasant; and though Tom Stowell was but a brutish\r\nspecimen of the class, he suddenly perceived that he was giving pain. He\r\npaused, scratched his head, and glancing affectionately towards his\r\ncompanion, exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\"But I shall live to see you on a handsomer beastis than that little\r\npony, Master Randal; and sure I ought, for you be as good a gentleman as\r\nany in the land.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Randal. \"But I like walking better than riding--I am\r\nmore used to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, and you walk bra'ly--there ben't a better walker in the county.\r\nAnd very pleasant it is walking; and 'tis a pretty country afore you,\r\nall the way to the Hall.\"\r\n\r\nRandal strode on, as if impatient of these attempts to flatter or to\r\nsoothe; and, coming at length into a broader lane, said--\"I think I can\r\nfind my way now. Many thanks to you, Tom;\" and he forced a shilling into\r\nTom's horny palm. The man took it reluctantly, and a tear started to his\r\neye. He felt more grateful for that shilling than he had for Frank's\r\nliberal half-crown; and he thought of the poor fallen family, and forgot\r\nhis own dire wrestle with the wolf at his door.\r\n\r\nHe stayed lingering in the lane till the figure of Randal was out of\r\nsight, and then returned slowly. Young Leslie continued to walk on at a\r\nquick pace. With all his intellectual culture, and his restless\r\naspirations, his breast afforded him no thought so generous, no\r\nsentiment so poetic, as those with which the unlettered clown crept\r\nslouchingly homeward.\r\n\r\nAs Randal gained a point where several lanes met on a broad piece of\r\nwaste land, he began to feel tired, and his step slackened. Just then a\r\ngig emerged from one of these by-roads, and took the same direction as\r\nthe pedestrian. The road was rough and hilly, and the driver proceeded\r\nat a foot's-pace; so that the gig and the pedestrian went pretty well\r\nabreast.\r\n\r\n\"You seem tired, sir,\" said the driver, a stout young farmer of the\r\nhigher class of tenants, and he looked down compassionately on the boy's\r\npale countenance and weary stride. \"Perhaps we are going the same way,\r\nand I can give you a lift?\"\r\n\r\nIt was Randal's habitual policy to make use of every advantage proffered\r\nto him, and he accepted the proposal frankly enough to please the honest\r\nfarmer.\r\n\r\n\"A nice day, sir,\" said the latter, as Randal sat by his side. \"Have you\r\ncome far?\"\r\n\r\n\"From Rood Hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you be young Squire Leslie,\" said the farmer, more respectfully,\r\nand lifting his hat.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my name is Leslie. You know Rood, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was brought up on your father's land, sir. You may have heard of\r\nFarmer Bruce?\"\r\n\r\n_Randal._--\"I remember, when I was a little boy, a Mr. Bruce, who\r\nrented, I believe, the best part of our land, and who used to bring us\r\ncakes when he called to see my father. He is a relation of yours?\"\r\n\r\n_Farmer Bruce._--\"He was my uncle. He is dead now, poor man.\"\r\n\r\n_Randal._--\"Dead! I am grieved to hear it. He was very kind to us\r\nchildren. But it is long since he left my father's farm.\"\r\n\r\n_Farmer Bruce_, apologetically.--\"I am sure he was very sorry to go.\r\nBut, you see, he had an unexpected legacy----\"\r\n\r\n_Randal._--\"And retired from business?\"\r\n\r\n_Farmer Bruce._--\"No. But, having capital, he could afford to pay a good\r\nrent for a real good farm.\"\r\n\r\n_Randal_, bitterly.--\"All capital seems to fly from the lands of Rood.\r\nAnd whose farm did he take?\"\r\n\r\n_Farmer Bruce._--\"He took Hawleigh, under Squire Hazeldean. I rent it\r\nnow. We've laid out a power o' money on it. But I don't complain. It\r\npays well.\"\r\n\r\n_Randal._--\"Would the money have paid as well, sunk on my father's\r\nland?\"\r\n\r\n_Farmer Bruce._--\"Perhaps it might, in the long run. But then, sir, we\r\nwanted new premises--barns, and cattle-sheds, and a deal more--which the\r\nlandlord should do; but it is not every landlord as can afford that.\r\nSquire Hazeldean's a rich man.\"\r\n\r\n_Randal._--\"Ay!\"\r\n\r\nThe road now became pretty good, and the farmer put his horse into a\r\nbrisk trot.\r\n\r\n\"But which way be you going, sir? I don't care for a few miles more or\r\nless, if I can be of service.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going to Hazeldean,\" said Randal, rousing himself from a reverie.\r\n\"Don't let me take you out of your way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Hawleigh Farm is on the other side of the village, so it be quite\r\nmy way, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe farmer then, who was really a smart young fellow--one of that race\r\nwhich the application of capital to land has produced, and which, in\r\npoint of education and refinement, are at least on a par with the\r\nsquires of a former generation--began to talk about his handsome horse,\r\nabout horses in general, about hunting and coursing; he handled all\r\nthese subjects with spirit, yet with modesty. Randal pulled his hat\r\nstill lower down over his brows, and did not interrupt him till past the\r\nCasino, when, struck by the classic air of the place, and catching a\r\nscent from the orange-trees, the boy asked abruptly--\"Whose house is\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it belongs to Squire Hazeldean, but it is let or lent to a foreign\r\nMounseer. They say he is quite the gentleman, but uncommonly poor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor,\" said Randal, turning back to gaze on the trim garden, the neat\r\nterrace, the pretty belvidere, and (the door of the house being open)\r\ncatching a glimpse of the painted hall within--\"poor; the place seems\r\nwell kept. What do you call poor, Mr. Bruce?\"\r\n\r\nThe farmer laughed. \"Well, that's a home question, sir. But I believe\r\nthe Mounseer is as poor as a man can be who makes no debts and does not\r\nactually starve.\"\r\n\r\n\"As poor as my father?\" asked Randal, openly and abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"Lord, sir! your father be a very rich man compared to him.\"\r\n\r\nRandal continued to gaze, and his mind's eye conjured up the contrast of\r\nhis slovenly, shabby home, with all its neglected appurtenances! No trim\r\ngarden at Rood Hall, no scent from odorous orange blossoms. Here poverty\r\nat least was elegant--there, how squalid! He did not comprehend at how\r\ncheap a rate the luxury of the Beautiful can be effected. They now\r\napproached the extremity of the Squire's park pales! and Randal, seeing\r\na little gate, bade the farmer stop his gig, and descended. The boy\r\nplunged amid the thick oak groves; the farmer went his way blithely, and\r\nhis mellow merry whistle came to Randal's moody ear as he glided quick\r\nunder the shadow of the trees.\r\n\r\nHe arrived at the Hall, to find that all the family were at church; and,\r\naccording to the patriarchal custom, the church-going family embraced\r\nnearly all the servants. It was therefore an old invalid housemaid who\r\nopened the door to him. She was rather deaf, and seemed so stupid that\r\nRandal did not ask leave to enter and wait for Frank's return. He\r\ntherefore said briefly that he would just stroll on the lawn, and call\r\nagain when church was over.\r\n\r\nThe old woman stared, and strove to hear him; meanwhile Randal turned\r\nround abruptly, and sauntered towards the garden side of the handsome\r\nold house.\r\n\r\nThere was enough to attract any eye in the smooth greensward of the\r\nspacious lawn--in the numerous parterres of varying flowers--in the\r\nvenerable grandeur of the two mighty cedars, which threw their still\r\nshadows over the grass--and in the picturesque building, with its\r\nprojecting mullions and heavy gables; yet I fear that it was with no\r\npoet's nor painter's eye that this young old man gazed on the scene\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\nHe beheld the evidence of wealth--and the envy of wealth jaundiced his\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nFolding his arms on his breast, he stood a while, looking all around him\r\nwith closed lips and lowering brow; then he walked slowly on, his eyes\r\nfixed on the ground, and muttered to himself----\r\n\r\n\"The heir to this property is little better than a dunce; and they tell\r\nme I have talents and learning, and I have taken to my heart the maxim,\r\n'Knowledge is power.' And yet, with all my struggles, will knowledge\r\never place me on the same level as that on which this dunce is born? I\r\ndon't wonder that the poor should hate the rich. But of all the poor,\r\nwho should hate the rich like the pauper gentleman? I suppose Audley\r\nEgerton means me to come into Parliament, and be a Tory like himself.\r\nWhat! keep things as they are! No; for me not even Democracy, unless\r\nthere first come Revolution. I understand the cry of a Marat--'More\r\nblood!' Marat had lived as a poor man, and cultivated science--in the\r\nsight of a prince's palace.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned sharply round, and glared vindictively on the poor old hall,\r\nwhich, though a very comfortable habitation, was certainly no palace;\r\nand with his arms still folded on his breast, he walked backwards, as if\r\nnot to lose the view, nor the chain of ideas it conjured up.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" he continued to soliloquize--\"but of revolution there is no\r\nchance. Yet the same wit and will that would thrive in revolutions\r\nshould thrive in this commonplace life. Knowledge is power. Well, then,\r\nshall I have no power to oust this blockhead? Oust him--what from? His\r\nfather's halls? Well, but if he were dead, who would be the heir of\r\nHazeldean? Have I not heard my mother say that I am as near in blood to\r\nthis Squire as any one, if he had no children? Oh, but the boy's life is\r\nworth ten of mine! Oust him from what? At least from the thoughts of his\r\nuncle Egerton--an uncle who has never even seen him! That, at least, is\r\nmore feasible. 'Make my way in life,' sayest thou, Audley Egerton?\r\nAy--and to the fortune thou hast robbed from my ancestors.\r\nSimulation--simulation. Lord Bacon allows simulation. Lord Bacon\r\npractised it--and--\"\r\n\r\nHere the soliloquy came to a sudden end; for as, rapt in his thoughts,\r\nthe boy had continued to walk backwards, he had come to the verge where\r\nthe lawn slided off into the ditch of the ha-ha--and, just as he was\r\nfortifying himself by the precept and practice of my Lord Bacon, the\r\nground went from under him, and slap into the ditch went Randal Leslie!\r\n\r\nIt so happened that the Squire, whose active genius was always at some\r\nrepair or improvement, had been but a few days before widening and\r\nsloping off the ditch just in that part, so that the earth was fresh and\r\ndamp, and not yet either turfed or flattened down. Thus when Randal,\r\nrecovering his first surprise and shock, rose to his feet, he found his\r\nclothes covered with mud; while the rudeness of the fall was evinced by\r\nthe fantastic and extraordinary appearance of his hat, which, hollowed\r\nhere, bulging there, and crushed out of all recognition generally, was\r\nas little like the hat of a decorous hard-reading young\r\ngentlemen--_protege_ of the dignified Mr. Audley Egerton--as any hat\r\npicked out of a kennel after some drunken brawl possibly could be.\r\n\r\nRandal was dizzy, and stunned, and bruised, and it was some moments\r\nbefore he took heed of his raiment. When he did so, his spleen was\r\ngreatly aggravated. He was still boy enough not to like the idea of\r\npresenting himself to the unknown Squire, and the dandy Frank, in such a\r\ntrim: he resolved at once to regain the lane and return home, without\r\naccomplishing the object of his journey; and seeing the footpath right\r\nbefore him, which led to a gate that he conceived would admit him into\r\nthe highway sooner than the path by which he had come, he took it at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising how little we human creatures heed the warnings of our\r\ngood genius. I have no doubt that some benignant power had precipitated\r\nRandal Leslie into the ditch, as a significant hint of the fate of all\r\nwho choose what is, now-a-days, by no means an uncommon step in the\r\nmarch of intellect--viz., the walking backwards, in order to gratify a\r\nvindictive view of one's neighbor's property! I suspect that, before\r\nthis century is out, many a fine fellow will thus have found his ha-ha,\r\nand scrambled out of the ditch with a much shabbier coat than he had on\r\nwhen he fell into it. But Randal did not thank his good genius for\r\ngiving him a premonitory tumble;--and I never yet knew a man who did!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nThe Squire was greatly ruffled at breakfast that morning. He was too\r\nmuch of an Englishman to bear insult patiently, and he considered that\r\nhe had been personally insulted in the outrage offered to his recent\r\ndonation to the parish. His feelings, too, were hurt, as well as his\r\npride. There was something so ungrateful in the whole thing, just after\r\nhe had taken so much pains, not only in the resuscitation, but the\r\nembellishment of the stocks. It was not, however, so rare an occurrence\r\nfor the Squire to be ruffled, as to create any remark. Riccabocca,\r\nindeed, as a stranger, and Mrs. Hazeldean, as a wife, had the quick tact\r\nto perceive that the host was glum and the husband snappish; but the one\r\nwas too discreet and the other too sensible, to chafe the new sore,\r\nwhatever it might be; and shortly after breakfast the Squire retired\r\ninto his study, and absented himself from morning service.\r\n\r\nIn his delightful _Life of Oliver Goldsmith_, Mr. Foster takes care to\r\ntouch our hearts by introducing his hero's excuse for not entering the\r\npriesthood. He did not feel himself good enough. Thy Vicar of Wakefield,\r\npoor Goldsmith, was an excellent substitute for thee; and Dr. Primrose,\r\nat least, will be good enough for the world until Miss Jemima's fears\r\nare realized. Now, Squire Hazeldean had a tenderness of conscience much\r\nless reasonable than Goldsmith's. There were occasionally days in which\r\nhe did not feel good enough--I don't say for a priest, but even for one\r\nof the congregation--\"days in which (said the Squire in his own blunt\r\nway), as I have never in my life met a worse devil than a devil of a\r\ntemper, I'll not carry mine into the family pew. He shan't be growling\r\nout hypocritical responses from my poor grandmother's prayer-book.\" So\r\nthe Squire and his demon stayed at home. But the demon was generally\r\ncast out before the day was over; and, on this occasion, when the bell\r\nrang for afternoon service, it may be presumed that the Squire had\r\nreasoned or fretted himself into a proper state of mind; for he was then\r\nseen sallying forth from the porch of his hall, arm-in-arm with his\r\nwife, and at the head of his household. The second service was (as is\r\ncommonly the case, in rural districts) more numerously attended than the\r\nfirst one; and it was our Parson's wont to devote to this service his\r\nmost effective discourse.\r\n\r\nParson Dale, though a very fair scholar, had neither the deep theology\r\nnor the archaeological learning that distinguish the rising generation of\r\nthe clergy. I much doubt if he could have passed what would now be\r\ncalled a creditable examination in the Fathers; and as for all the nice\r\nformalities in the rubric, he would never have been the man to divide a\r\ncongregation or puzzle a bishop. Neither was Parson Dale very erudite in\r\necclesiastical architecture. He did not much care whether all the\r\ndetails in the church were purely gothic or not: crockets and finials,\r\nround arch and pointed arch, were matters, I fear, on which he had never\r\ntroubled his head. But one secret Parson Dale did possess, which is\r\nperhaps of equal importance with those subtler mysteries--he knew how to\r\nfill his church! Even at morning service no pews were empty, and at\r\nevening service the church overflowed.\r\n\r\nParson Dale, too, may be considered, now-a-days, to hold but a mean idea\r\nof the spiritual authority of the Church. He had never been known to\r\ndispute on its exact bearing with the State--whether it was incorporated\r\nwith the State, or above the State--whether it was antecedent to the\r\nPapacy, or formed from the Papacy, &c., &c. According to his favorite\r\nmaxim, _Quieta non movere_ (not to disturb things that are quiet), I\r\nhave no doubt that he would have thought that the less discussion is\r\nprovoked upon such matters, the better for both church and laity. Nor\r\nhad he ever been known to regret the disuse of the ancient custom of\r\nexcommunication, nor any other diminution of the powers of the\r\npriesthood, whether minatory or militant; yet for all this, Parson Dale\r\nhad a great notion of the sacred privilege of a minister of the\r\ngospel--to advise--to deter--to persuade--to reprove. And it was for the\r\nevening service that he prepared those sermons, which may be called\r\n\"sermons that preach _at_ you.\" He preferred the evening for that\r\nsalutary discipline, not only because the congregation was more\r\nnumerous, but also because, being a shrewd man in his own innocent way,\r\nhe knew that people bear better to be preached at after dinner than\r\nbefore; that you arrive more insinuatingly at the heart when the stomach\r\nis at peace. There was a genial kindness in Parson Dale's way of\r\npreaching at you. It was done in so imperceptible fatherly a manner,\r\nthat you never felt offended. He did it, too, with so much art, that\r\nnobody but your own guilty self knew that you were the sinner he was\r\nexhorting. Yet he did not spare rich nor poor: he preached at the\r\nSquire, and that great fat farmer, Mr. Bullock the church-warden, as\r\nboldly as at Hodge the ploughman, and Scrub the hedger. As for Mr.\r\nStirn, he had preached at _him_ more often than at any one in the\r\nparish; but Stirn, though he had the sense to know it, never had the\r\ngrace to reform. There was, too, in Parson Dale's sermons, something of\r\nthat boldness of illustration which would have been scholarly if he had\r\nnot made it familiar, and which is found in the discourses of our elder\r\ndivines. Like them, he did not scruple, now and then, to introduce an\r\nanecdote from history, or borrow an allusion from some non-scriptural\r\nauthor, in order to enliven the attention of his audience, or render an\r\nargument more plain. And the good man had an object in this, a little\r\ndistinct from, though wholly subordinate to the main purpose of his\r\ndiscourse. He was a friend to knowledge--but to knowledge accompanied by\r\nreligion; and sometimes his references to sources not within the\r\nordinary reading of his congregation would spirit up some farmer's son,\r\nwith an evening's leisure on his hands, to ask the Parson for farther\r\nexplanation, and so he lured on to a little solid or graceful\r\ninstruction under a safe guide.\r\n\r\nNow on the present occasion, the Parson, who had always his eye and\r\nheart on his flock, and who had seen with great grief the realization of\r\nhis fears at the revival of the stocks; seen that a spirit of discontent\r\nwas already at work amongst the peasants, and that magisterial and\r\ninquisitorial designs were darkening the natural benevolence of the\r\nSquire; seen, in short, the signs of a breach between classes, and the\r\nprecursors of the ever inflammable feud between the rich and the poor,\r\nmeditated nothing less than a great Political Sermon--a sermon that\r\nshould extract from the roots of social truths a healing virtue for the\r\nwound that lay sore, but latent, in the breast of his parish of\r\nHazeldean:\r\n\r\nAnd thus ran--\r\n\r\n_The Political Sermon of Parson Dale._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n     \"For every man shall bear his own burden.\"\r\n\r\n     _Galatians_, c. vi., v. 5.\r\n\r\n\"Brethren, every man has his burden. If God designed our lives to end at\r\nthe grave, may we not believe that he would have freed an existence so\r\nbrief from the cares and sorrows to which, since the beginning of the\r\nworld, mankind has been subjected? Suppose that I am a kind father, and\r\nhave a child whom I dearly love, but I know by a divine revelation that\r\nhe will die at the age of eight years, surely I should not vex his\r\ninfancy by needless preparations for the duties of life. If I am a rich\r\nman, I should not send him from the caresses of his mother to the stern\r\ndiscipline of school. If I am a poor man, I should not take him with me\r\nto hedge and dig, to scorch in the sun, to freeze in the winter's cold:\r\nwhy inflict hardships on his childhood, for the purpose of fitting him\r\nfor manhood, when I know that he is doomed not to grow into man? But if,\r\non the other hand, I believe my child is reserved for a more durable\r\nexistence, then should I not, out of the very love I bear to him,\r\nprepare his childhood for the struggle of life, according to that\r\nstation in which he is born, giving many a toil, many a pain to the\r\ninfant, in order to rear and strengthen him for his duties as man? So is\r\nit with our Father that is in heaven. Viewing this life as our infancy,\r\nand the next as our spiritual maturity, where, 'in the ages to come, he\r\nmay show the exceeding riches of his grace,' it is in his tenderness, as\r\nin his wisdom, to permit the toil and the pain which, in tasking the\r\npowers and developing the virtues of the soul, prepare it for the\r\nearnest of our inheritance, the 'redemption of the purchased\r\npossession.' Hence it is that every man has his burden. Brethren, if you\r\nbelieve that God is good, yea, but as tender as a human father, you will\r\nknow that your troubles in life are a proof that you are reared for an\r\neternity. But each man thinks his own burden the hardest to bear: the\r\npoor man groans under his poverty, the rich man under the cares that\r\nmultiply with wealth. For, so far from wealth freeing us from trouble,\r\nall the wise men who have written in all ages, have repeated with one\r\nvoice the words of the wisest, 'When goods increase, they are increased\r\nthat eat them; and what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the\r\nbeholding of them with their eyes?' And this is literally true, my\r\nbrethren; for, let a man be as rich as was the great King Solomon\r\nhimself, unless he lock up all his gold in a chest, it must go abroad to\r\nbe divided amongst others; yea, though, like Solomon, he make him great\r\nworks--though he build houses and plant vineyards, and make him gardens\r\nand orchards--still the gold that he spends feeds but the mouths he\r\nemploys; and Solomon himself could not eat with a better relish than the\r\npoorest mason who builded the house, or the humblest laborer who planted\r\nthe vineyard. Therefore, 'when goods increase, they are increased that\r\neat them.' And this, my brethren, may teach us toleration and compassion\r\nfor the rich. We share their riches whether they will or not; we do not\r\nshare their cares. The profane history of our own country tells us that\r\na princess, destined to be the greatest queen that ever sat on this\r\nthrone, envied the milk-maid singing; and a profane poet, whose wisdom\r\nwas only less than that of the inspired writers, represents the man who\r\nby force and wit had risen to be a king, sighing for the sleep\r\nvouchsafed to the meanest of his subjects--all bearing out the words of\r\nthe son of David--'The sleep of the laboring man is sweet, whether he\r\neat little or much; but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to\r\nsleep.'\r\n\r\n\"Amongst my brethren now present, there is doubtless some one who has\r\nbeen poor, and by honest industry has made himself comparatively rich.\r\nLet his heart answer me while I speak: are not the chief cares that now\r\ndisturb him to be found in the goods he hath acquired?--has he not both\r\nvexations to his spirit and trials to his virtue, which he knew not when\r\nhe went forth to his labor, and took no heed of the morrow? But it is\r\nright, my brethren, that to every station there should be its care--to\r\nevery man his burden; for if the poor did not sometimes so far feel\r\npoverty to be a burden as to desire to better their condition, and (to\r\nuse the language of the world) 'seek to rise in life,' their most\r\nvaluable energies would never be aroused; and we should not witness that\r\nspectacle, which is so common in the land we live in--namely, the\r\nsuccessful struggle of manly labor against adverse fortune--a struggle\r\nin which the triumph of one gives hope to thousands. It is said that\r\nnecessity is the mother of invention; and the social blessings which are\r\nnow as common to us as air and sunshine, have come from that law of our\r\nnature which makes us aspire towards indefinite improvement, enriches\r\neach successive generation by the labors of the last, and, in free\r\ncountries, often lifts the child of the laborer to a place amongst the\r\nrulers of the land. Nay, if necessity is the mother of invention,\r\npoverty is the creator of the arts. If there had been no poverty, and no\r\nsense of poverty, where would have been that which we call the wealth of\r\na country? Subtract from civilization all that has been produced by the\r\npoor, and what remains?--the state of the savage. Where you now see\r\nlaborer and prince, you would see equality indeed--the equality of wild\r\nmen. No; not even equality there; for there, brute force becomes\r\nlordship, and woe to the weak! Where you now see some in frieze, some in\r\npurple, you would see nakedness in all. Where stand the palace and the\r\ncot, you would behold but mud huts and caves. As far as the peasant\r\nexcels the king among savages, so far does the society exalted and\r\nenriched by the struggles of labor excel the state in which Poverty\r\nfeels no disparity, and Toil sighs for no ease. On the other hand, if\r\nthe rich were perfectly contented with their wealth, their hearts would\r\nbecome hardened in the sensual enjoyments it procures. It is that\r\nfeeling, by Divine Wisdom implanted in the soul, that there is vanity\r\nand vexation of spirit in the things of Mammon, which still leaves the\r\nrich man sensitive to the instincts of heaven, and teaches him to seek\r\nfor happiness in those elevated virtues to which wealth invites\r\nhim--namely, protection to the lowly and beneficence to the distressed.\r\n\r\n\"And this, my brethren, leads me to another view of the vast subject\r\nopened to us by the words of the apostle--'Every man shall bear his own\r\nburden.' The worldly conditions of life are unequal. Why are they\r\nunequal? O my brethren, do you not perceive? Think you that, if it had\r\nbeen better for our spiritual probation that there should be neither\r\ngreat nor lowly, rich nor poor, Providence would not so have ordered the\r\ndispensations of the world, and so, by its mysterious but merciful\r\nagencies, have influenced the framework and foundations of society? But\r\nif, from the remotest period of human annals, and in all the numberless\r\nexperiments of government which the wit of man has devised, still this\r\ninequality is ever found to exist, may we not suspect that there is\r\nsomething in the very principles of our nature to which that inequality\r\nis necessary and essential? Ask why this inequality! Why? as well ask\r\nwhy life is the sphere of duty and the nursery of virtues. For if all\r\nmen were equal, if there were no suffering and no ease, no poverty and\r\nno wealth, would you not sweep with one blow the half at least of human\r\nvirtues from the world? If there were no penury and no pain, what would\r\nbecome of fortitude?--what of patience?--what of resignation? If there\r\nwere no greatness and no wealth, what would become of benevolence, of\r\ncharity, of the blessed human pity, of temperance in the midst of\r\nluxury, of justice in the exercise of power? Carry the question further;\r\ngrant all conditions the same--no reverse, no rise and no fall--nothing\r\nto hope for, nothing to fear--what a moral death you would at once\r\ninflict upon all the energies of the soul, and what a link between the\r\nheart of man and the Providence of God would be snapped asunder! If we\r\ncould annihilate evil, we should annihilate hope; and hope, my brethren,\r\nis the avenue to faith. If there be 'a time to weep, and a time to\r\nlaugh,' it is that he who mourns may turn to eternity for comfort, and\r\nhe who rejoices may bless God for the happy hour. Ah! my brethren, were\r\nit possible to annihilate the inequalities of human life, it would be\r\nthe banishment of our worthiest virtues, the torpor of our spiritual\r\nnatures, the palsy of our mental faculties. The moral world, like the\r\nworld without us, derives its health and its beauty from diversity and\r\ncontrast.\r\n\r\n\"'Every man shall bear his own burden.' True; but now turn to an earlier\r\nverse in the same chapter. 'Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil\r\nthe law of Christ.' Yes; while Heaven ordains to each his peculiar\r\nsuffering, it connects the family of man into one household, by that\r\nfeeling which, more perhaps than any other, distinguishes us from the\r\nbrute creation--I mean the feeling to which we give the name of\r\n_sympathy_--the feeling for each other! The herd of deer shun the stag\r\nthat is marked by the gunner; the flock heedeth not the sheep that\r\ncreeps into the shade to die; but man has sorrow and joy not in himself\r\nalone, but in the joy and sorrow of those around him. He who feels only\r\nfor himself, abjures his very nature as man; for do we not say of one\r\nwho has no tenderness for mankind that he is _inhuman_? and do we not\r\ncall him who sorrows with the sorrowful, _humane_?\r\n\r\n\"Now, brethren, that which especially marked the divine mission of our\r\nLord, is the direct appeal to this sympathy which distinguishes us from\r\nthe brute. He seizes not upon some faculty of genius given but to few,\r\nbut upon that ready impulse of heart which is given to us all; and in\r\nsaying, 'Love one another,' 'Bear ye one another's burdens,' he elevates\r\nthe most delightful of our emotions into the most sacred of his laws.\r\nThe lawyer asks our Lord, 'who is my neighbor?' Our Lord replies by the\r\nparable of the Good Samaritan. The priest and the Levite saw the wounded\r\nman that fell among the thieves, and passed by on the other side. That\r\npriest might have been austere in his doctrine, that Levite might have\r\nbeen learned in the law; but neither to the learning of the Levite, nor\r\nto the doctrine of the priest, does our Saviour even deign to allude. He\r\ncites but the action of the Samaritan, and saith to the lawyer, 'Which\r\nnow of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbor unto him that fell among\r\nthe thieves? And he said, He that showed mercy unto him. Then said Jesus\r\nunto him, Go, and do thou likewise.'\r\n\r\n\"O shallowness of human judgments! It was enough to be born a Samaritan\r\nin order to be rejected by the priest, and despised by the Levite. Yet\r\nnow, what to us the priest and the Levite, of God's chosen race though\r\nthey were? They passed from the hearts of men when they passed the\r\nsufferer by the wayside; while this loathed Samaritan, half thrust from\r\nthe pale of the Hebrew, becomes of our family, of our kindred; a brother\r\namongst the brotherhood of Love, so long as Mercy and Affliction shall\r\nmeet in the common thoroughfare of Life!\r\n\r\n\"'Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ!' Think\r\nnot, O my brethren, that this applies only to almsgiving--to that relief\r\nof distress which is commonly called charity--to the obvious duty of\r\ndevoting, from our superfluities, something that we scarcely miss, to\r\nthe wants of a starving brother. No. I appeal to the poorest amongst ye,\r\nif the worst burdens are those of the body--if the kind word and the\r\ntender thought have not often lightened your hearts more than bread\r\nbestowed with a grudge, and charity that humbles you by a frown.\r\nSympathy is a beneficence at the command of us all,--yea, of the pauper\r\nas of the king; and sympathy is Christ's wealth. Sympathy is\r\nbrotherhood. The rich are told to have charity for the poor, and the\r\npoor are enjoined to respect their superiors. Good: I say not to the\r\ncontrary. But I say also to the poor, '_In your turn have charity for\r\nthe rich_;' and I say to the rich, '_In your turn respect the poor_.'\r\n\r\n\"'Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.' Thou,\r\nO poor man, envy not nor grudge thy brother his larger portion of\r\nworldly goods. Believe that he hath his sorrows and crosses like\r\nthyself, and perhaps, as more delicately nurtured, he feels them more;\r\nnay, hath he not temptations so great that our Lord hath exclaimed--'How\r\nhardly they that have riches enter into the kingdom of heaven?' And what\r\nare temptations but trials?--what are trials but perils and sorrows?\r\nThink not that you cannot bestow your charity on the rich man, even\r\nwhile you take your sustenance from his hands. A heathen writer, often\r\ncited by the earliest preachers of the gospel, hath truly\r\nsaid--'Wherever there is room for a man, there is place for a benefit.'\r\n\r\n\"And I ask any rich brother amongst you when he hath gone forth to\r\nsurvey his barns and his granaries, his gardens and orchards, if\r\nsuddenly, in the vain pride of his heart, he sees the scowl on the brow\r\nof the laborer--if he deems himself hated in the midst of his wealth--if\r\nhe feels that his least faults are treasured up against him with the\r\nhardness of malice, and his plainest benefits received with the\r\ningratitude of envy--I ask, I say, any rich man, whether straightway all\r\npleasure in his worldly possessions does not fade from his heart, and\r\nwhether he does not feel what a wealth of gladness it is in the power of\r\nthe poor man to bestow! For all these things of Mammon pass away; but\r\nthere is in the smile of him whom we have served, a something that we\r\nmay take with us into heaven. If, then, ye bear one another's burdens,\r\nthey who are poor will have mercy on the errors, and compassion for the\r\ngriefs of the rich. To all men it was said--yes, to the Lazarus as to\r\nthe Dives--'Judge not, that ye be not judged.' But think not, O rich\r\nman, that we preach only to the poor. If it be their duty not to grudge\r\nthee thy substance, it is thine to do all that may sweeten their labor.\r\nRemember, that when our Lord said, 'How hardly shall they that have\r\nriches enter into the kingdom of heaven,' he replied also to them who\r\nasked, 'Who then shall be saved?' 'The things which are impossible with\r\nmen are possible with God:' that is, man left to his own temptations\r\nwould fail; but strengthened by God, he shall be saved. If thy riches\r\nare the tests of thy trial, so may they also be the instruments of thy\r\nvirtues. Prove by thy riches that thou art compassionate and tender,\r\ntemperate and benign; and thy riches themselves may become the evidence\r\nat once of thy faith and of thy works.\r\n\r\n\"We have constantly on our lips the simple precept, 'Do unto others as\r\nye would be done by.' Why do we fail so often in the practice? Because\r\nwe neglect to cultivate that SYMPATHY which nature implants as an\r\ninstinct, and the Saviour exalts as a command. If thou wouldst do unto\r\nthy neighbor as thou wouldst be done by, ponder well how thy neighbor\r\nwill regard the action thou art about to do to him. Put thyself into his\r\nplace. If thou art strong, and he is weak, descend from thy strength,\r\nand enter into his weakness; lay aside thy burden for the while, and\r\nbuckle on his own; let thy sight see as through his eyes--thy heart beat\r\nas in his bosom. Do this, and thou wilt often confess that what had\r\nseemed just to thy power will seem harsh to his weakness. For 'as a\r\nzealous man hath not done his duty, when he calls his brother drunkard\r\nand beast,'[29] even so an administrator of the law mistakes his object\r\nif he writes on the grand column of society, only warnings that irritate\r\nthe bold, and terrify the timid: and a man will be no more in love with\r\nlaw than with virtue, 'if he be forced to it with rudeness and\r\nincivilities.' If, then, ye would bear the burden of the lowly, O ye\r\ngreat--feel not only _for_ them, but _with!_ Watch that your pride does\r\nnot chafe them--your power does not wantonly gall. Your worldly inferior\r\nis of the class from which the apostles were chosen--amidst which the\r\nLord of Creation descended from a throne above the seraphs.\"\r\n\r\nThe Parson here paused a moment, and his eye glanced towards the pew\r\nnear the pulpit, where sat the magnate of Hazeldean. The Squire was\r\nleaning his chin thoughtfully on his hand, his brow inclined downwards,\r\nand the natural glow of his complexion much heightened.\r\n\r\n\"But\"--resumed the Parson softly, without turning to his book, and\r\nrather as if prompted by the suggestion of the moment--\"But he who has\r\ncultivated sympathy commits not these errors, or, if committing them,\r\nhastens to retract. So natural is sympathy to the good man, that he\r\nobeys it mechanically when he suffers his heart to be the monitor of his\r\nconscience. In this sympathy behold the bond between rich and poor! By\r\nthis sympathy, whatever our varying worldly lots, they become what they\r\nwere meant to be--exercises for the virtues more peculiar to each; and\r\nthus, if in the body each man bear his own burden, yet in the fellowship\r\nof the soul all have common relief in bearing the burdens of each other.\r\nThis is the law of Christ--fulfil it, O my flock!\"\r\n\r\nHere the Parson closed his sermon, and the congregation bowed their\r\nheads.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[28] By the pounds Milanese, Giacomo means the Milanese lira.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGleanings from the Journals.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. TURNBULL says in the _Medical Gazette_, \"It has struck me that, if\r\nwe could discover any substance which could be so applied as to contract\r\nthe _iris_, one cause of the effect of shortsightedness would be\r\nremedied. The result, I am happy to say, has been most satisfactory. In\r\nthe first instance I applied the extract of ginger, which was rubbed\r\nfive or ten times over the whole forehead, with the view of acting upon\r\nthe fifth pair of nerves. Afterwards I substituted a concentrated\r\ntincture, of the strength of one part of ginger to two parts of spirits\r\nof wine, decolorated by animal charcoal. In numerous cases this\r\napplication has almost doubled the vision.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. GEORGE CRUIKSHANK has presided over a temperance meeting at Bristol.\r\nHe maintained in his address that if Shakspeare were alive now, he would\r\nbe of their society! \"In 'Othello,' there was the character of a bad\r\nman, one Iago, who, setting himself to work the ruin of another, begins\r\nby making him drunk, and when it is first offered to him the answer is,\r\n'Not to-night, good Iago. I have very poor and unhappy brains for\r\ndrinking. I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of\r\nentertainment.' They would re-echo that wish, he was sure; courtesy\r\nmight invent a better custom of entertainment than that of\r\ndrinking\"--(applause). We observe that the meeting gave three cheers for\r\n\"The Bottle.\" A stranger to modern engravings would no doubt consider\r\nthis in the last degree inconsistent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe find in the London papers accounts of a Copying Electric Telegraph,\r\ninvented by a Mr. Bakewell, who had given lectures upon it at the\r\nRussell Institution. Its object is the transmission of the _handwriting_\r\nof correspondents. Its advantages are, freedom from error, as the\r\nmessages transmitted are fac-similes of the originals: authentication of\r\nthe communications by the transmission of copies of the handwriting;\r\nincreased rapidity, to such an extent that a single wire may be as\r\neffective as ten with the needle telegraph, and consequent economy in\r\nthe construction of telegraphic lines of communication. The secrecy of\r\ncorrespondence would also be maintained in a greater degree by the\r\ncopying telegraph, as it would afford peculiar facility for transmitting\r\nmessages in cipher, and the telegraph clerks, instead of being compelled\r\nby their duties to read all the messages transmitted, might be forbidden\r\nfrom perusing any portion but the address. As an additional means of\r\nsecrecy, the messages may be transmitted invisibly, by moistening the\r\npaper with diluted muriatic acid alone, the writing being rendered\r\nlegible by a solution of prussiate of potass.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe \"original Mrs. Partington\" was a respectable old lady (says _Notes\r\nand Queries_), living at Sidmouth, in Devonshire. Her cottage was on the\r\nbeach, and during an awful storm (November, 1824, when some fifty or\r\nsixty ships were wrecked at Plymouth) the sea rose to such a height as\r\nevery now and then to invade the old lady's place of domicile; in fact,\r\nalmost every wave dashed in at the door. Mrs. Partington, with such help\r\nas she could command, with mops and brooms, as fast as the water entered\r\nthe house, mopped it out again; until at length the waves had the\r\nmastery, and the dame was compelled to retire to an upper story of the\r\nhouse. The first allusion to the circumstance was made by Lord Brougham\r\nin his celebrated speech in the House of Commons on the Reform Bill, in\r\nwhich he compared the Conservative opposition to the bill to be like the\r\nopposition of \"Dame Partington, who endeavored to mop out the waves of\r\nthe Atlantic.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is stated that the Neapolitan Government has granted a sum of twenty\r\nthousand ducats for continuing the excavations at Pompeii.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[29] JEREMY TAYLOR--_Of Christian Prudence_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLadies' Fashions for January.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe evening costumes of the present season are characterized by profuse\r\ntrimming. The skirts of the newest dresses, excepting those composed of\r\nvery rich materials, are all very fully trimmed. Corsages, whether high\r\nor low, are ornamented in some way or other. Flounces, employed to trim\r\nthe skirts of ball dresses, are made somewhat fuller than heretofore.\r\nEven lace flounces, which used to be set on plain, are now gathered up\r\nin slight fulness. To add still more to the appearance of amplitude in\r\ndresses trimmed with lace, some dressmakers edge the skirts with a\r\nfontange of ribbon. With ball dresses of transparent textures, trimmed\r\nwith flounces of the same, this fontange of ribbon is frequently placed\r\nat the edge of the slip worn under the dress. Tulle dresses are now\r\nfashionable for ball costume. Some pretty organdy muslins, intended for\r\nvery young ladies, have just been introduced. These dresses should be\r\nmade with two jupes, simply edged with a broad hem.\r\n\r\nCloth is adopted for morning walking dresses, _redingote_ form, open\r\ndown the front, and embroidered in arabesque pattern, in silk braid and\r\nother trimming; the sleeves are worked at bottom, and open, to admit\r\nunderneath cambric or muslin sleeves tight at the wrist; the body is\r\nembroidered to match the skirts. With this _redingote_ is worn a\r\n_pardessus_ of the same cloth, embroidered in front and at bottom with\r\nbraiding of from two to two and a half inches wide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe more showy dresses, and a little _decolletees_, are square in front\r\n(Louis XV. style), the body pointed, the skirt plain, and but few\r\nflounces. The colors are sombre and plain; the materials are velvet,\r\nsatin, damask, watered, _antique_, and some plaids, for the theatres and\r\nfor half dress. These dresses are always worn with open sleeves, trimmed\r\nwith _engageantes_.\r\n\r\nShort velvet cloaks, richly embroidered either in satin stitch, silk\r\nbraid, or gimp, are in vogue, the preferred colors being burnt-bread and\r\nblack. Short velvet cloaks, of the paletot shape, half tight, trimmed\r\nwith lace, embroidered entirely in satin stitch, and with narrow\r\nbraiding, are also worn.\r\n\r\nOn mantelets of silk, entirely embroidered velvet ribbon is worn; or\r\nstamped velvet flowers, upon the stuff, produce a very pleasing effect.\r\nThe braid used for the arabesque pattern is commonly plain, or has only\r\na thick cord, and is from half to three quarters of an inch wide.\r\nWalking boots, entirely of leather, are the most fashionable.\r\n\r\nIn the _Illustrations_ which we give this month:\r\n\r\nI. Is a Cap of Alencon lace, with flat bows of ribbon, and lappets of\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nII. A Bonnet of pink satin, covered with cut black velvet. A trimming of\r\nblack lace encircles the crown. The bonnet may be lined either with pink\r\nsatin or with black velvet; and the under trimming consists of small\r\npink flowers. Strings of pink satin ribbon.\r\n\r\nIII. _Engageantes_ of India muslin, with two rows of Mechlin lace, one\r\nabove the other.\r\n\r\nIV. Velvet mantelet, with arabesque in silk braiding, a quarter of an\r\ninch wide, and satin stitch, slightly fitting to the waist; wide\r\nsleeves, and entirely embroidered.\r\n\r\nV. (See the group of figures upon the following page.)\r\n\r\n(I.) _Evening Costume for a Bride, back view._--The headdress a wreath\r\nof white roses, mingled with orange-blossom. Back hair arranged in\r\ntwists, in the style called _noeud d' Apollon_. Across the forehead\r\nmay be worn a narrow bandeau of pearls or diamonds. Dress of white crape\r\nover white satin; front of the skirt with bouquets of the same flowers\r\nas those in the wreath. The corsage has a berthe of folds of white\r\ntulle. The sleeves slightly full, and ornamented on the shoulder with\r\nepaulettes of tulle. Necklace, a single row of pearls. (II.) _Costume\r\nfor an Evening Party._--Dress of brocade, the ground a dark violet\r\ncolor, with large bouquets of flowers in a variety of hues.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA _sortie de bal_ of cerulean blue satin, edged with a broad band of\r\nvelvet of the same color, on which a braid is disposed in a zigzag\r\npattern. The headdress of loops of narrow blue velvet ribbon fixed on\r\neach side of the head. (III.) _Bride's dress suited to the Nuptial\r\nCeremony._--Robe of white satin; the skirt ornamented with side\r\ntrimmings, consisting each of a row of lace, headed by a fronce of white\r\nsatin ribbon. This trimming is set on spirally up each side of the\r\nskirt, and is attached at intervals by small bows of white satin ribbon.\r\nThe corsage is half high at the back, and is sloped somewhat lower in\r\nfront. The front of the corsage is trimmed with rows of lace set on\r\nhorizontally. On the neck is worn a chemisette of lace. The sleeves are\r\nfinished at the ends with a full trimming of white satin ribbon. The\r\nunder-sleeves are loose at the ends, and are edged with two rows of\r\nlace. On each arm a bracelet of gold, one of the serpent pattern, and\r\nthe other fastened by a cameo snap. Bridal wreath of orange-blossom and\r\njasmin. A very large veil of tulle illusion is fixed under the wreath\r\ninstead of being thrown over it, as is sometimes customary.",
