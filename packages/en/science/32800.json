For species have their appointed\r\nperiods as well as individuals: viewed in the infinite mind of GOD, the\r\nCreator, from the standpoint of eternity, each form, each race, had its\r\nproper duration assigned to it--a duration which, doubtless, varied in\r\nthe different species as greatly as that assigned to the life of one\r\nindividual animal differs from that assigned to the life of another. As\r\nthe elephant or the eagle may survive for centuries, while the horse and\r\nthe dog scarcely reach to twenty years, and multitudes of insects are\r\nborn and die within a few weeks, so one species may have assigned to\r\nits life, for aught I know, a hundred thousand years as its normal\r\nperiod, and another not more than a thousand. If creation was, with\r\nrespect to the species, what I have elsewhere proved it was with respect\r\nto the individual,[1]--a violent irruption into the cycle of life--then\r\nwe may well conceive this to have taken place at very varying relative\r\nperiods in the life-history of the different species;--that is to say,\r\nthat at a given date, (viz., that of creation) one species might be just\r\ncompleting, _ideally_, its allotted course, another just commencing, and\r\na third attaining its meridian.\r\n\r\nCertain it is, that not a few species of animals have died during the\r\npresent constitution of things. Races, which we know on indubitable\r\nevidence to have existed during the dominion of man, have died out, have\r\nbecome extinct, so that not a single individual survives. The entire\r\ntotality of individuals which constituted the species, have, in these\r\ncases, ceased to be. Some of these seem to have died at a very early era\r\nof human history; but others at a comparatively recent period, and some\r\neven within our own times. Even within the last twenty years several\r\nanimals have been taken, of which it is highly probable that not a\r\nsingle representative remains on the earth; while there are others yet\r\nagain, which we know to be reduced to a paucity so extreme, that their\r\nextinction can scarcely be delayed more than a few years at most. Thus\r\nwe may consider ourselves as standing by the dying-beds of these\r\ncreatures, with the consciousness that we shall soon see them no more;\r\nthat the sentence is gone forth against them; that their sands are\r\nrunning to the last grains, and that no effort of ours can materially\r\nprolong their existence. The facts from which these conclusions are\r\ndrawn are highly curious, and I shall endeavour to lay them, with as\r\nmuch brevity as they will allow, before my readers.\r\n\r\nOn that prochronic hypothesis, by which alone, as I conceive, the facts\r\nrevealed by geological investigation can be reconciled with the unerring\r\nstatements of Scripture,--every word of which is truth, the truth of a\r\n\"God that cannot lie,\"--we may assume the actual creation of this earth\r\nto have taken place at that period which is geologically known as the\r\nlater Tertiary Era, or thereabout. When, on the third day, \"the waters\r\nunder the heaven were gathered together into one place, and the dry land\r\nappeared,\" it is not necessary to suppose that the form assumed by the\r\nemerging land was immediately that which it now has; we may, on the\r\nother hand, I think, assume as likely, that successive or continuous\r\nchanges of elevation followed, which have been protracted, perhaps\r\nconstantly decreasing in extent and force, to the present hour.[2]\r\n\r\nPerhaps between the six days' work of Creation and the Noachic Flood,\r\nEurope became much altered in outline, and in elevation. It may have\r\nbeen, at first, a great archipelago, agreeing with the epithet by which\r\nit is designated in early Scripture, \"the Isles,\"[3] and by which it\r\nwas subsequently known for ages. The Pyrenees, the Alps, and the\r\nApennines, already emerged, were slowly uniting, and the Carpathians,\r\nthe Balkan, the Taurus, and the Caucasus, were uprearing, while the vast\r\nregions to the north were still an expanse of open sea. England was\r\nprobably united with the newly-formed European continent, and embraced\r\nIreland in one great mass of unbroken land, which stretched far away\r\ninto the Atlantic. Volcanoes were active in the north of Ireland, and in\r\nthe west of Scotland, pouring forth those floods of fiery lava which\r\nhave cooled into the columnar forms seen at the Giant's Causeway and the\r\nCave of Fingal. Slowly the north of Europe emerged, and the great\r\nsouth-west expanse of Britain sank beneath the sea, leaving, it may be,\r\nthe large island of Atlantis in mid-ocean, to be submerged by a later\r\ncatastrophe.\r\n\r\nProbably changes very similar were coevally taking place in Asia and\r\nNorth America, while the vast flat alluvial regions of South America\r\nwere, perhaps, even still more recently formed, and a great Pacific\r\ncontinent was in course of subsidence, of which Australasia and\r\nPolynesia are the existing remains.\r\n\r\nSuch changes of elevation, and of the continuity of land, must effect\r\nconsiderable alterations of climate; and, therefore, it is not\r\nsurprising to know that, in earliest ages, animals and plants flourished\r\nin regions to which they would now be altogether unfitted, and that\r\nmany races existed then which have since died out; for geological and\r\nclimatal modifications are among the most easily conceivable causes of\r\nthe decease of species.\r\n\r\nIn the great swamps of emerging Germany, and in the, as yet, only\r\nhalf-drained valleys of Switzerland, lurked then the heavy Dinothere.\r\nHuger than the hugest elephant, he carried an enormous body of twenty\r\nfeet in length, vast and barrel-like, which even his columnar limbs of\r\nten feet long scarcely sufficed to raise from the ground. His uncouth\r\nhead, elephantine in shape, was furnished with a short proboscis; and\r\ntwo tusks, short and strong, projected from the lower jaw, not curving\r\nupward, as in the elephant, but downward, as in the walrus. In the\r\nteeming marshes lurked this ungainly beast, half immersed, digging out\r\nwith his mighty pickaxe-tusks the succulent roots that permeated the\r\nsoft soil, which his sensitive trunk picked up, and conveyed to his\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nOn the southern slopes of the slowly-rising Himalayas, already clothed\r\nwith forests of teak, and palm, and bamboo, revelled the Sivathere,\r\nanother heavy creature, of the bulk of a rhinoceros, and therefore not\r\nmore than half equalling the German colossus. He too was a strange\r\nsubject. With a proportionally enormous head, in form somewhat between\r\nthat of the elephant and of the rhinoceros, minute sunken piggish eyes,\r\nand a short proboscis like that of the tapir, he carried two pairs of\r\ndissimilar horns. On the forehead were placed one pair, seated upon bony\r\ncores, not unlike those of our short-horn oxen. Behind these there rose\r\nanother pair, large and massive, which were palmated and branching,\r\nlike those of the fallow-deer, but on a gigantic scale. What sort of a\r\nbody, and what kind of limbs, furnished the complement of this\r\ncuriously-compound head, we do not exactly know; but surely it must have\r\nbeen a very remarkable form, as it browsed quietly and blamelessly,\r\namong the luxuriant shrubs of those sun-facing slopes.\r\n\r\nIn the same regions a land Tortoise of enormous bulk, far vaster than\r\nthe vastest of now existing species, to which that ponderous one which\r\nwill march merrily away with a ton weight on its back, is a mere pigmy,\r\nshook the earth with its waddle, and the forests with its hoarse\r\nbellowing. Broad roads, like our highways, were beaten by it through the\r\njungle, along which it periodically travelled to the cool springs,\r\nleisurely sauntering, and tarrying to munch the fleshy gourds and\r\ncactuses that bordered its self-made track.\r\n\r\nThe plains of Siberia, stretching away towards the Arctic Ocean,\r\nsheltered countless hosts of huge pachydermatous quadrupeds. A species\r\nof Rhinoceros, not less bulky than those of the present age, roamed to\r\nthe very verge of the Icy Sea; its hide, tough and leathery, was\r\ndestitute of folds, but was clothed with tufts of rigid gray hair,--an\r\nornament which is denied to our existing degenerates. Two horns, the\r\nfront one of unusual massiveness and length, were seated, as in several\r\nof the African kinds, one behind the other, and were wielded by a head\r\nof great strength and development.\r\n\r\nMore remarkable still was that great hairy Elephant, called the\r\nMammoth, which appears to have swarmed in those cold plains by myriads.\r\nOf equal dimensions to the Indian species of the present age, this\r\ndenizen of the north had far more enormous curving tusks, and instead of\r\nthe naked hide of those we are familiar with, his body was encased in\r\nblack hair, with a thick under stratum of red curled wool, and bore a\r\nlong mane on the ridge of the neck.\r\n\r\nThere was, at the same time, a quadruped, nearly allied to the\r\nelephants, but differing from them in some technical characters. With a\r\nbody equally bulky, but considerably longer, it had shorter limbs, a\r\nbroader head, small tusks in the lower, as well as large curving ones in\r\nthe upper jaw, and probably a trunk intermediate between the elephant's\r\nand the tapir's. Truly cosmopolite as this great Mastodon was, for we\r\ndig up his bones from all parts of the world, he had his head-quarters\r\nin North America, where, from his dimensions and his numbers, he must\r\nhave formed a very characteristic feature of the primeval swamps and\r\nforests. There, with his tusks, he grubbed up the young trees, whose\r\njuicy roots he ground down with his great mammillary molar teeth, or\r\nchewed up to a pulp the sapwood of the recent branches and spicy twigs.\r\nAnd ever and anon he would resort to the broad saline marshes,--the\r\n\"Licks,\" as they are now called,--to lick up the crystallised salt on\r\ntheir margins, so grateful to all herbivorous quadrupeds. Here, in his\r\neagerness to gratify his palate with the pungent condiment, he would\r\npress farther and farther into the treacherous quagmire, till he began\r\nto sink, and then, in his terror, he would plunge and flounder, getting\r\nmore and more deeply bemired, till at length he could struggle no more,\r\nand the bog would close over him, and he would be no more seen till some\r\nspectacled geologist of this nineteenth century, note-book in hand,\r\nwould go and dig up his remains, marvelling at the freshness with which\r\nthey had been preserved in the antiseptic peat.\r\n\r\nBut let us look at South America, where, as the great back-bone chain of\r\nthe Andes is being elevated out of the sea, the torrents and cataracts\r\nare pouring down from its sides immense quantities of crumbled rock and\r\npasty mud, which, deposited upon the vast tabular field, brought by the\r\nupheaving just to the level of the sea, forms that grand alluvial plain\r\nunequalled on the face of the globe for extent, which is clothed with\r\nthe mighty forests of Guiana and Brazil, or with the tall grass and\r\nthistles of the Pampas. The torrents still fall; and, meandering through\r\nthis glorious plain, unite and form the most majestic of rivers, ever\r\ndepositing the rich alluvium, and thus sensibly augmenting, to this day,\r\nthe breadth of their noble continent, and their own length.\r\n\r\nStrange creatures riot here in these primal ages. The young land, hot\r\nand moist,--moist with the unevaporated water of the depositing rivers,\r\nand hot with the influence of the submarine volcano which is lifting it,\r\nas well as with the beams of the tropical sun,--brings forth from its\r\nsteaming bosom, the most gigantic trees in the most profuse luxuriance.\r\nAnd animal life teems too, in this riant vegetation. Millions of\r\ninsects,--ants, and termites, and beetles,--are busy at work upon the\r\ntrunks of the great trees, eating them down, and swarming in their\r\nimmense populous nests, beyond all imaginings. Surely they will soon eat\r\nup the entire forest, dense and rapid as it grows, and there will be\r\nnothing left but cities of insects. No fear! See those great waddling\r\nbeasts[4] with stout short legs, and enormous hoof-like claws so bent\r\ninward that the creatures are obliged to walk on the edge of their\r\npaws,--they are equally busy with the insects, tearing apart with their\r\npowerful claws the earthy nests as fast as they are built, and devouring\r\nthe makers themselves by wholesale. Here is a wonderful creature, a vast\r\narmadillo, with a body as big as a rhinoceros, covered with a convex\r\noval shield, formed of hexagonal plates accurately fitted to each other.\r\nSee how he approaches a fallen tree, which his unerring instinct tells\r\nhim is perforated through and through, and filled with the swarming\r\nmillions of ants; with his powerful jaws he munches up the entire mass;\r\nthe thin and papery partitions of the dusty wood are ground to powder,\r\nand the ants are licked in and chewed into a black pulp between those\r\ncurious cylinders of teeth.\r\n\r\nBut lo! here are mightier creatures yet! See the vast Mylodon, the\r\nScelidothere, and the still more colossal Megathere. Ponderous giants\r\nthese! The very forests seem to tremble under their stately stride.\r\nTheir immense bulk preponderates behind, terminating in a tail of\r\nwonderful thickness and solidity: the head is mean and awakens no\r\nterror; the eye lacks lustre and threatens no violence, though the whole\r\nform betokens vast power, and the stout limbs are terminated by the same\r\nstout, inbent, sharp hoof-claws. One of them approaches that\r\nwide-spreading locust-tree; he gazes up at the huge mud-brown structures\r\nthat resemble hogsheads affixed to the forks of the branches, and he\r\nknows that the luscious termites are filling them to overflowing. His\r\nlips water at the tempting sight; have them he must. But how? that heavy\r\nsternpost of his was never made for climbing; yet see! he rears himself\r\nup against the tree; is he about to essay the scaling? Not he: he knows\r\nhis powers better. He gives it one embrace; one strong hug; as if to\r\ntest its thickness and hold upon the earth. Now he is digging away\r\nbelow, scooping out the soft soil from between the roots,--and it is\r\nmarvellous to note how rapidly he lays them bare with those great\r\nshovel-like claws of his. Now he rears himself again; straddles wide on\r\nhis hind feet, fixing the mighty claws deep in the ground; plants\r\nhimself firmly on his huge tail, as on the third foot of a tripod, and\r\nonce more grasps the tree. The enormous hind quarters, the limbs and the\r\nloins, the broad pelvis, the thick spinal cord supplying abundant\r\nnervous energy to the swelling muscles, inserted in the ridged and\r\nkeeled bones, all come into play, as a _point d'appui_ for the Herculean\r\neffort. \"And now conceive the massive frame of the Megathere convulsed\r\nwith the mighty wrestling, every vibrating fibre reacting upon its bony\r\nattachment with the force of a hundred giants: extraordinary must be the\r\nstrength and proportions of the tree, if, when rocked to and fro, to\r\nright and left, in such an embrace, it can long withstand the efforts of\r\nits assailant.\"[5] It yields; the roots fly up; the earth is scattered\r\nwide upon the surrounding foliage; the tree comes down with a thundering\r\ncrash, cracking and snapping the great boughs like glass; the frightened\r\ninsects swarm out at every orifice; but the huge beast is in upon them;\r\nwith his sharp hoofs he tears apart the crusty walls of the earth-nests,\r\nand licks out their living contents, fat pupæ, eggs and all, rolling\r\ndown the sweet morsels, half sucking, half chewing, with a delighted\r\ngusto that repays him for all his mighty toil.\r\n\r\nWhile the heavy giant is absorbed in his juicy breakfast, see, there\r\nlounges along his neighbour, the Macrauchen. Equally massive, equally\r\nheavy, equally vast, equally peaceful, the stranger resembles a huge\r\nrhinoceros elevated on much loftier limbs; but his most remarkable\r\nfeature is an enormously long neck, like that of the camel, but carried\r\nto the altitude of that of the giraffe. Thus he thrusts his great muzzle\r\ninto the very centre of the leafy trees, and gathering with his\r\nprehensile and flexible lip the succulent twigs and foliage, he too\r\nfinds abundance of food for his immense body, in the teeming vegetation,\r\nwithout intruding upon the supply of his fellows.\r\n\r\nAnd what enormous mass is suddenly thrust up out of the quiet water of\r\nyonder igaripé? A hoarse, hollow grunt, as it comes up, tells us that\r\nit is alive, and now we discern that it is the head of an animal--the\r\nToxodon. Half hidden as it is under the shadow of the fan-palms, and the\r\nbroad, arrowy leaves of the great arums that grow out of the lake, we\r\nsee the little piggish eyes, set far up in the great head, and wide\r\napart, peeping with a curious union of stupidity and shrewdness; the\r\nimmense muzzle and lips; the broad cheeks armed with stiff projecting\r\nbristles; and, as the creature opens its cavernous mouth to seize a\r\nfloating gourd, an extraordinary array of incurving teeth, strangely\r\nbowed so as to make a series of arches of immense power. Now, with his\r\nstrong front teeth, he tears up the great fleshy arum-roots from the\r\nclay of the bank, and grinds them to pulp; and now, with another grunt,\r\nthe vast bristly head sinks beneath the water, and we see it no more.\r\nHundreds of other creatures are straying around,--sloths, bats, and\r\nmonkeys, and birds of gay plumage, on the trees; ant-eaters and cavies,\r\nlizards and snakes, on the ground; butterflies and humming-birds\r\nhovering in the air; tapirs and turtles and crocodiles in the\r\nwaters;--but these are matters of course:--we are only thinking of such\r\nas have passed away and left no descendants to perpetuate their forms to\r\nour own times.\r\n\r\nAway to the great Austral land--in our day minished to the insular\r\nAustralia and New Zealand and a few satellite isles--but then, in the\r\nmorning of creation, possibly stretching far to the north and on either\r\nhand, so as to include the scattered groups of Polynesia in one great\r\ncontinent, and even to reach so far as Madagascar on the west. This was\r\nthe region of gigantic fowls, and of marsupial quadrupeds. Kangaroos of\r\neight or nine feet in stature leaped over the primeval bush, and wombats\r\nand dasyures of elephantine bulk burrowed in the hill sides, and great\r\nlion-like beasts prowled about the plains. But surely the most\r\ncharacteristic feature of the scene was impressed by the birds! Vast\r\nstruthious birds, which would have looked down with supreme contempt on\r\nthe loftiest African ostrich, whose limb-bones greatly exceeded in bulk\r\nthose of our dray horses, whose three-toed feet made a print in the clay\r\nsome eighteen inches long, and whose proud heads commanded the horizon\r\nfrom an elevation of twelve feet above the ground,--terrible birds,\r\nwhose main development of might was in the legs and feet, being utterly\r\ndestitute of the least trace of wings--these strode swiftly about the\r\nrank ferny brakes, possessing a conscious power of defence in the back\r\nstroke of their muscular feet, and fearless of man or beast, mainly\r\nnocturnal in their activity, concealing themselves by day in the\r\nrecesses of the dense forests, where the majestic trees were interwoven\r\nwith cable-like climbers, or couching in the midst of tall reeds and\r\naroideous plants that margined the great swampy lakes of these regions.\r\n\r\nBut what of our own land? What of these distant isles of the Gentiles in\r\nthat early day, when the enterprising sons of Cain, migrating from the\r\nalready straitened land of Nod, were pushing their advancing columns,\r\nwith arts and arms, in all directions over the young earth? Did any of\r\nthem reach to the as yet insular Europe, settling themselves along the\r\nmargins of its deep gulfs and draining basins? Perhaps they did, and\r\neven explored the utmost limits of the great Atlantic island, on the\r\nremains of which we live. What did they find here? A land of mountain\r\nand valley, of plain and down, of lake and river, of bog and fell, of\r\nforest and field, in some features much as now: where the oak, and elm,\r\nand ash covered great tracts, and the birch and fir clothed the hills;\r\nbut where the yew and the laurel grew side by side with the\r\ncustard-apple and the fan-palm, and the ground was overrun with trailers\r\nof the gourd and melon kind, but where grasses were few and scarce, the\r\nexquisite order _Rosaceæ_, with its beautiful flowers and grateful\r\nfruit, was rarely seen, and the aromatic _Labiatæ_--the thyme, and mint,\r\nand sage--were as yet unknown.\r\n\r\nAnd the beasts that already tenanted this fair land were for bulk and\r\npower worthy of the domain. The Dinothere and the Mastodon wallowed and\r\nbrowsed where great London now crowds its princely palaces. Through the\r\ngreenwood shades of the forests of oak wandered hippopotamuses and\r\nrhinoceroses of several kinds, the long-tusked mammoth, and two or three\r\nspecies of horses. Two gigantic oxen--a bison and a urus--roamed over\r\nthe fir-clad hills of Scotland, and a curious flat-headed ox, of small\r\nsize and minute horns, made Ireland its peculiar home. That island, too,\r\nwas the metropolis of a colossal fallow-deer, whose remains, ticketed as\r\nthose of the Irish Elk, astonish us in our museums. It stood seven feet\r\nin height at the withers, and waved its branching antlers, eleven feet\r\nwide, twelve feet and upwards above the ground;[6] yet its magnificent\r\nstature could not preserve it from a not infrequent fate, that of\r\nbecoming intombed in the deep bogs of its native isle. Britain had,\r\nmoreover, a stag of scarcely less gigantic proportions, with the\r\nreindeer of the north, and the smaller kinds with which we are now\r\nfamiliar.\r\n\r\nAll these herbivores, and numberless smaller genera, some now extinct,\r\nsome surviving, were kept in check by powerful predatory tyrants, for\r\nwhose representatives we must now look to the jungles of India or the\r\nburning karroos of Southern Africa. The Lion and the Tiger stalked over\r\nthese isles, and a terrible tiger-like creature, the Machairode, of even\r\nsuperior size and power to the scourge of the Bengal jungle, with curved\r\nand saw-edged canine-teeth, hung upon the flanks of the cervine and\r\nbovine herds, and sprang upon the fattest of them. Then, too, there was\r\na vast Bear, huger and mightier than the fearful grizzly bear of\r\nAmerica, which haunted caves, and prowling around forced down with its\r\nhorrid paws the shaggy bull, and broke his stout neck by main force, and\r\ndragged the body home to devour at leisure. And many of these caves, the\r\nholes and chasms of the limestone districts, were inhabited by a\r\ngigantic species of Hyena, which seems to have existed in great numbers,\r\nso that the caverns are strewn all over, from end to end, with thousands\r\nof teeth and disjointed bones, both of the hyenas themselves and of the\r\nother carnivores; shewing that there they lived and died in successive\r\ngenerations; and, mainly, of other creatures, of very varied species,\r\ngreat and small, most of them cracked, and crushed, and gnawed, shewing\r\nthe plain marks of the powerful conical teeth of those obscene nocturnal\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nThus I have endeavoured to draw a picture, vague and imperfect, I know,\r\nof some of the more remarkable and prominent features of the primeval\r\nearth, limiting the sketch to those forms which we know only by their\r\nfossil remains. In endeavouring to paint their contour and general\r\nappearance, and still more their habits and instincts, conjecture must\r\nbe largely at work--a conjecture, however, which takes for its basis the\r\nanatomical exigencies of the osseous structure, and the analogy of\r\nexisting creatures the most nearly related to the fossil.\r\n\r\nThese forms, many of them so huge and uncouth, are well known as having\r\ntenanted various regions of the earth during what is known as the\r\nTertiary Era, in its later periods. They certainly do not exist in those\r\nregions now. When did their life--their species-life--terminate? I have\r\nbeen assuming that they were upon the earth, as living sentient beings,\r\nin the earliest age of what we call the historic period--that is,\r\naccording to the chronology of the Word of God, which must be true,\r\nwithin the last six thousand years. This assumption is so heterodox,\r\nthat unsupported by evidence, it would be generally rejected; let us\r\nthen inquire what evidence there is that man was an inhabitant of the\r\nglobe contemporaneously with these huge giants of the bestial creation.\r\n\r\nI do not pretend to offer positive evidence concerning the synchronism\r\nof _all_ the animals I have been describing with man; but, as there is\r\nno doubt that they were all contemporaneous, _inter se_, if we can\r\nattain to good grounds for concluding his co-existence with _some_ of\r\nthem, it may be no unfair presumption that the case was so with the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nAnd first, with respect to the _Colossochelys Atlas_, that vast fossil\r\nland tortoise of the Sewalik hills, in the north of India, whose\r\ncarapace may have covered an area of twelve or fifteen feet in diameter,\r\nand whose entire length, as in walking, when head and tail were\r\nprotruded, could not have been much less than thirty feet. The\r\ndiscoverers of this interesting relic, Dr Falconer and Major Cauntley,\r\nhave discussed the question of its probable cessation of existence with\r\nsome care; and they have come to the conclusion \"that there are fair\r\ngrounds for entertaining the belief, as probable, that the\r\n_Colossochelys Atlas_ may have lived down to an early period of the\r\nhuman epoch, and become extinct since.\" This they infer on two grounds:\r\nfirst, from the fact that, in the same strata, which are not limited to\r\nthe Sewalik hills, but extend, with the remains of this immense\r\ntortoise, all over the great Indian area, from Ava to the Gulf of\r\nCambay, other tortoises, crocodiles, &c., which were contemporary with\r\nthe _Colossochelys_, have survived to the present time; and, secondly,\r\nfrom mythologic and cosmogonic traditions of many eastern nations,\r\nhaving reference to a tortoise of such gigantic size as to be associated\r\nin the current fables with an elephant.[7]\r\n\r\nElian, the Greek naturalist, quoting Megasthenes, a still older\r\nauthority, who resided several years in India, and who collected a good\r\ndeal of interesting information concerning the country, reports that in\r\nthe sea around Ceylon there were found tortoises of such enormous\r\ndimensions that huts were made of their shells, each shell being fifteen\r\ncubits (or twenty-two feet) long; so that several people were able to\r\nfind comfortable shelter under it from the rain and sun.[8] And both\r\nStrabo and Pliny[9] assert that the Chelonophagi, who inhabited the\r\nshores of the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, converted the enormous\r\nshells of the turtles which they caught into roofs for their houses and\r\nboats for their little voyages. It has been suggested that the\r\n_Colossochelys_ may have given origin to these statements; but I rather\r\nthink the great sea-turtles of the genus _Chelone_ are referred to, the\r\nconvex shells of which are known in our own day to reach to a length of\r\neight feet or upwards.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances attending the discovery of the rhinoceros and elephant\r\nof Siberia are very curious and interesting; since of them we have not\r\nthe fossilised skeletons, but the carcases preserved in a fresh state,\r\nas if just dead, with (in one case) the flesh upon the bones in an\r\neatable state, and actually forming the food of dogs and wolves, the\r\nskin entire, and covered with fur, and even the eyes so perfectly\r\npreserved that the pupils could be distinctly seen.\r\n\r\nIn 1771, in the frozen gravelly soil of Wilhuji, in the northern part of\r\nSiberia, an animal was found partially exposed. It was twelve feet in\r\nlength; its body was enveloped in a skin which had the thickness and\r\nfirmness of sole-leather, but was destitute of folds. Short hair,\r\nstrongly planted in the pores of the skin, grew on the face in tufts; it\r\nwas rigid in texture, and of a grey hue, with here and there a black\r\nbristle, larger and stiffer than the rest. Short ash-grey hair was\r\nobserved to clothe the legs, in moderate profusion. The eyelids and\r\neyelashes were still visible; the remains of the brain were still in the\r\ncavity of the skull, and the flesh of the body, in a putrefying\r\ncondition, was still beneath the skin. On the nose there were\r\nindications of a horn having been seated, around which the integument\r\nhad formed a sort of fold.\r\n\r\nThus the creature was known to be a Rhinoceros, and the head and feet\r\nwere lifted, and conveyed to St Petersburg, where they are still\r\npreserved in the Imperial Museum. Men of science soon remarked that in\r\nvery many points this specimen differed from any species now known; and,\r\nindeed, a hairy rhinoceros was, in itself, an anomaly. Subsequent\r\ninvestigations have revealed that the same species, known as _Rhinoceros\r\ntichorhinus_, inhabited Siberia in great numbers, and is now extinct.\r\n\r\nNearly thirty years afterwards a still more interesting revelation\r\noccurred. The shores of the Icy Ocean had yielded a vast number of\r\ntusks, not distinguishable from those of the known elephants, and\r\ncapable of being worked up by ivory-manufacturers, so that they occupied\r\na well-recognised place in the commercial markets, and they constitute\r\nto this day the principal supply of the Russian ivory-turners. A\r\nfisherman living at the mouth of the Lena, being one day engaged in\r\ncollecting tusks, saw among some ice-blocks an uncouth object. The next\r\nyear he observed it still further exposed, and in the following season,\r\n1801, he saw that it was an enormous animal, having great tusks, one of\r\nwhich, with the entire side of the carcase, projected from the frozen\r\nmass. He knew it to be a _Mammoth_, for so the fossil elephants were\r\ncalled, and observed it with interest. The next season was so cold that\r\nno change took place; but in 1803, the melting of the ice proceeded so\r\nfar that the gigantic animal fell down from the cliff entire, and was\r\ndeposited on the sand beneath. The following season the fisherman,\r\nSchumachoff, cut out the tusks, which he sold for fifty rubles, and two\r\nyears after this the scene was visited by Mr Adams, in the service of\r\nthe Imperial Court, who has given an interesting account of his\r\nobservations, made, it must be remembered, in the seventh year after the\r\nfirst discovery:--\r\n\r\n\"I found the Mammoth,\" observes this gentleman, \"still in the same\r\nplace, but altogether mutilated ... the Jakutski of the neighbourhood\r\nhaving cut off the flesh, with which they fed their dogs during the\r\nscarcity. Wild beasts, such as white bears, wolves, wolverines, and\r\nfoxes, also fed upon it, and the traces of their footsteps were seen\r\naround. The skeleton, almost entirely devoid of its flesh, remained\r\nwhole, with the exception of one fore-leg. The head was covered with a\r\ndry skin; one of the ears, well preserved, was furnished with a tuft of\r\nhairs. All these parts have necessarily been injured in transporting\r\nthem a distance of 7330 miles (to St Petersburg); but the eyes have been\r\npreserved, and the pupil of one can still be distinguished.\r\n\r\n\"The Mammoth was a male, with a long mane on the neck. The tail and\r\nproboscis were not preserved. The skin, of which I possess\r\nthree-fourths, is of a dark-grey colour, covered with reddish wool and\r\nblack hairs; but the dampness of the spot, where it had lain so long,\r\nhad in some degree destroyed the hair. The entire carcase, of which I\r\ncollected the bones on the spot, was nine feet four inches high, and\r\nsixteen feet four inches long, without including the tusks, which\r\nmeasured nine feet six inches along the curve. The distance from the\r\nbase or root of the tusk to the point is three feet seven inches. The\r\ntwo tusks together weighed three hundred and sixty pounds, English\r\nweight, and the head alone four hundred and fourteen pounds.\r\n\r\n\"I next detached the skin of the side on which the animal had lain,\r\nwhich was well preserved. This skin was of such extraordinary weight\r\nthat ten persons found difficulty in transporting it to the shore. After\r\nthis I dug the ground in different places, to ascertain whether any of\r\nits bones were buried, but principally to collect all the hairs which\r\nthe white bears had trod into the ground while devouring the flesh.\r\nAlthough this was difficult from the want of instruments, I succeeded in\r\ncollecting more than a pood (thirty-six pounds) of hair. In a few days\r\nthe work was completed, and I found myself in possession of a treasure\r\nwhich amply recompensed me for the fatigues and dangers of the journey,\r\nand the considerable expenses of the enterprise.... The escarpment of\r\nice was thirty-five to forty toises high; and, according to the report\r\nof the Tungusians, the animal was, when they first saw it, seven toises\r\nbelow the surface of the ice, &c. On arriving with the Mammoth at\r\nBorchaya, our first care was to separate the remaining flesh and\r\nligaments from the bones, which were then packed up. When I arrived at\r\nthe Jakutsk, I had the good fortune to repurchase the tusks, and from\r\nthence expedited the whole to St Petersburg. The skeleton is now in the\r\nMuseum of the Academy, and the skin still remains attached to the head\r\nand feet. A part of the skin, and some of the hair of this animal were\r\nsent by Mr Adams to Sir Joseph Banks, who presented them to the Museum\r\nof the Royal College of Surgeons. The hair is entirely separated from\r\nthe skin, excepting in one very small part, where it still remains\r\nattached. It consists of two sorts, common hair and bristles, and of\r\neach there are several varieties, differing in length and thickness.\r\nThat remaining fixed on the skin is of the colour of the camel, an inch\r\nand a-half long, very thick-set, and curled in locks. It is interspersed\r\nwith a few bristles about three inches long, of a dark-reddish colour.\r\nAmong the separate parcels of hair are some rather redder than the short\r\nhair just mentioned, about four inches; and some bristles nearly black,\r\nmuch thicker than horse hair, and from twelve to eighteen inches long.\r\nThe skin, when first brought to the Museum, was offensive; it is now\r\nquite dry and hard, and where most compact, is half-an-inch thick. Its\r\ncolour is the dull black of the living elephants.\"[10]\r\n\r\nTo me this narrative possesses an intense interest, and I have gazed\r\nwith great curiosity on the bit of dried and blackened leather that is\r\npreserved in the Museum in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, knowing it to have\r\npresented the primal freshness of life within the present century. I\r\ncannot help thinking that both the rhinoceros and this elephant roamed\r\nover the plains of Siberia, not only since the creation of man, but even\r\nsince the Deluge. The freshness of their state shews that the freezing\r\nup of their carcases must have been sudden, and immediate upon death.\r\nWhat supposition so natural as that, perhaps in a blinding snowstorm,\r\nthey slipped into a crevice in the ice-cliff, were snowed up instantly,\r\nand thus preserved by the antiseptic power of frost to this age? The\r\nglaciers of the north may hold multitudes more of these and kindred\r\ncreatures, some of which may yet be disinterred, or thawed out, and may\r\nlift yet more the curtain which so tantalisingly covers the conditions\r\nof their life-history. These two huge Pachyderms are certainly extinct\r\nnow; yet their remains, scattered over so vast an area, are everywhere\r\nassociated with those of other animals which were indubitably\r\ncontemporary with them, and whose species-life is continued to our own\r\ntimes. Some of these, as the great bear and the musk-ox of the sub-polar\r\nregions, we know to be in the habit of migrating northward in spring,\r\nand southward in autumn. That no lack of suitable food would be found,\r\neven in such high latitudes, for browsing quadrupeds, appears from the\r\nfact that, even beyond the parallel of 75° north, large birch-trees are\r\nfound embedded in the cliffs, in abundance sufficient to be largely used\r\nas common fuel, and still retaining their woody fibre, their bark,\r\nbranches, and roots. The climate then was not _greatly_ different from\r\nwhat it is now, when the birch, as a tree, reaches to about 70°.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe that both this elephant and this rhinoceros\r\nwere inhabitants of England also; and that at the same period as the\r\ncavern bear, the hyena, the lion, and the machairode, the baboon, the\r\nbison, and the urus, the Irish elk, and the extinct horse; at the same\r\ntime too, as the reindeer, the stag, the black bear, the wolf and fox,\r\nthe beaver, the wild cat, the hare, and rabbit, the otter and badger,\r\nthe wild hog, the rat and mouse, all our present shrews, the mole, the\r\nstoat and polecat, the noctule and the horse-shoe bats. And curious it\r\nis to note, as we go over this list, how some of the creatures\r\nenumerated are long extinct everywhere, some have been long extinct in\r\nEngland, but are still found elsewhere, some have more recently become\r\nextinct here, but at different eras, some are nearly extinguished, and\r\nsome are yet abundant in different degrees.\r\n\r\nI do not attach much importance to the traditions of the Siberians, that\r\nthe tusks and skeletons which they find belonged to a large\r\nsubterraneous animal, which could not bear the light; nor to those of\r\nthe Chinese, respecting a similar burrowing quadruped of prodigious\r\nbulk, which they call, by a sort of irony, _tyn-schu_, or the mouse that\r\nhides himself. The fables may have easily been formed from the\r\nobservation of the fossil bones, and do not necessarily imply any memory\r\nof the living original.\r\n\r\nThe two examples of the exhumation of _Pachydermata_ in a fresh state,\r\nwhich I have given in detail, are by no means the only cases that have\r\noccurred. It is the universally-received belief throughout Siberia, that\r\nMammoths have been found with the flesh quite fresh and filled with\r\nblood; probably meaning that the animal juices flowed when thawed.\r\nIsbrand Ides mentions a head on which the flesh, in a decaying state,\r\nwas present; and a frozen leg, as large as the body of a man; and Jean\r\nBernhard Müller speaks of a tusk, the cavity of which was filled with a\r\nsubstance which resembled coagulated blood.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the voyage of Sarytschew, particulars are given of the\r\ndiscovery of a Mammoth on the banks of the Alaseia, a river which flows\r\ninto the Arctic Ocean, beyond the Indigirska. It had been dislodged by a\r\nflood, and somewhat injured; but the carcase was still almost entire,\r\nand was covered with the skin, to which in some places long hair\r\nremained attached.\r\n\r\nThese statements might reasonably have been esteemed either fables or\r\ngross exaggerations, but for the subsequent discovery of the rhinoceros\r\nand elephant whose remains have been brought to Europe. Read in the\r\nlight of these accounts, the earlier stories take the dignity of\r\nauthentic history; and it is interesting to note how well these details\r\nagree with those observed by the accurate Adams;--the long hair, for\r\nexample, with which the Alaseia carcase was clothed being the very\r\ncounterpart of that upon the Lena elephant; though _à priori_ we should\r\nhave looked for a very different condition in the integument of these\r\nhuge Pachyderms.\r\n\r\nIf we look now at the great Mastodon, that elephantine beast, which with\r\na stature equal to that of the tallest African elephant combined a much\r\ngreater length of body and bulk of limb, we shall see some reason for\r\nconcluding that the period of its decease is not indefinitely removed\r\nfrom our own era. Its remains occur in greatest abundance in North\r\nAmerica; and it is interesting to observe that among several of the\r\naboriginal tribes of Red men there were extant traditions of the\r\nMastodon as a living creature. Dim, vague, and distorted these\r\ntraditions are; but so far from our rejecting them _in toto_ on that\r\naccount, we ought rather to consider these characters as evidence of\r\ntheir antiquity. When semi-savage nations present us with\r\norally-preserved accounts of very remote objects or actions, we look, as\r\na matter of course, for a considerable element of the wild, and\r\nextravagant, and absurd in them. If we found nothing but what was\r\nreasonable, and consistent, and intelligible, we should say in a moment,\r\nthis account cannot have been transmitted very far. The question, in the\r\ncase before us, is not, we must remember, the precise habits and\r\ninstincts of the Mastodon, but whether the Indians knew anything at all\r\nof the Mastodon having ever been a living animal. Now, as I have\r\nobserved, they had. M. Fabri, a French officer who had served in Canada,\r\ninformed Buffon that the Red men spoke of the great bones which lay\r\nscattered in various parts of that region as having belonged to an\r\nanimal which, after their oriental style, they named _Le Père aux\r\nB{oe}ufs_. The Shawnee Indians believed that with these enormous animals\r\nthere existed men of proportionate development, and that the Great Being\r\ndestroyed both with thunderbolts. Those of Virginia stated that, as a\r\ntroop of these terrible quadrupeds were destroying the deer, the bisons,\r\nand the other animals created for the use of the Indians, the Great Man\r\nslew them all with His thunder, except the big bull, who, nothing\r\ndaunted, presented his enormous forehead to the bolts, and shook them\r\noff as they fell, till, being at last wounded in the side, he fled\r\ntowards the great lakes, where he is to this day.\r\n\r\nEvidence of the comparatively-recent entombment of these remains exists,\r\nhowever, of another character. They do not in general appear to have\r\nbeen rolled, but to have lived where they are now found; in some\r\ninstances, as along the Great Osage River, being imbedded in a vertical\r\nposition, as if the animals had been suddenly bogged in the swampy soil.\r\nNor is there any great accumulation of earth upon them generally. All\r\nalong the edges of that great saline morass called, from the abundance\r\nof these animal relics, Big Bone Lick, and on the borders, the skeletons\r\nare found sunk in the soft earth, many of them not more than a yard or\r\ntwo below the surface, and some even scarcely covered. With them are\r\nfound in large numbers the bones of the existing bison, the wapiti-stag,\r\nand other herbivores, which still throng to the same place, for the same\r\nreasons, and meet the same fate.\r\n\r\nComparative anatomy determines, from the structure of the bones of the\r\nhead in the Mastodon, that it must have carried a proboscis like that of\r\nthe elephant. This, though wholly fleshy, has left traces of its\r\nexistence. Barton reports that, in 1762, out of five skeletons which\r\nwere seen by the natives, one skull still possessed what they described\r\nas a \"long nose\" with the mouth under it. And Kalm, in speaking of a\r\nskeleton, discovered by the Indians in what is now the State of\r\nIllinois, says that the form of the trunk was still apparent, though\r\nhalf decomposed. The preservation of these perishable tissues in this\r\ncase must doubtless be attributed to the salt with which the bog-earth\r\nis saturated. Still more recently a skeleton was found in Virginia,\r\nwhich contained a very interesting proof of the food of the animal: a\r\nmass of twigs, grass, and leaves, in a half-bruised state, enclosed in a\r\nsort of sac, lay within the cavity of the body, doubtless the contents\r\nof the stomach. Some of the twigs could be identified as those of\r\nexisting species of trees and shrubs, among them a species of _rose_,\r\nstill common in the region.\r\n\r\nAll this is very strong evidence that the deposition of these remains\r\ncannot have taken place in a _very_ remote era,--that, in fact, it must\r\nhave been since the general deluge recorded in the Word of God.\r\n\r\nHugh Miller has an interesting observation concerning the actual date of\r\ngeologic phenomena in North America, compared with that of their\r\ncounterparts in the Old World. He says, \"The much greater remoteness of\r\nthe mastodontic period in Europe than in America is a circumstance\r\nworthy of notice, as it is one of many facts that seem to indicate a\r\ngeneral transposition of at least the later geologic ages on the\r\nopposite sides of the Atlantic. Groups of corresponding character on the\r\neastern and western shores of this great ocean were not contemporaneous\r\nin time. It has been repeatedly remarked that the existing plants and\r\ntrees of the United States, with not a few of its fishes and reptiles,\r\nbear in their forms and constructions the marks of a much greater\r\nantiquity than those of Europe. The geologist who set himself to\r\ndiscover similar types on the eastern side of the Atlantic, would have\r\nto seek for them among the deposits of the later tertiaries. North\r\nAmerica seems to be still passing through its later tertiary ages; and\r\nit appears to be a consequence of this curious transposition, that while\r\nin Europe the mastodontic period is removed by two great geologic eras,\r\nfrom the present time, it is removed from it in America by only\r\none.\"[11]\r\n\r\nProfessor Agassiz has expressed opinions of the same character, adducing\r\nthe present existence in America of several forms of animals, which are\r\nknown in this hemisphere only in a fossil state.[12]\r\n\r\nI cannot refrain from adding the following combination of fact and\r\nspeculation, from the pen of an accomplished traveller in Mexico. It\r\nopens up a new train of ideas:--\r\n\r\n\"Some time before our visit, a number of workmen were employed on the\r\nneighbouring estate of Chapingo, to excavate a canal over that part of\r\nthe plain from which the waters have gradually retired during the last\r\nthree centuries. At four feet below the surface, they reached an ancient\r\ncauseway, of the existence of which there was of course not the most\r\nremote suspicion. The cedar piles, by which the sides were supported,\r\nwere still sound at heart. Three feet below the edge of this ancient\r\nwork, in what may have been the very ditch, they struck upon the entire\r\nskeleton of a Mastodon, embedded in the blue clay. Many of the most\r\nvaluable bones were lost by the careless manner in which they were\r\nextricated; others were ground to powder on their conveyance to the\r\ncapital, but sufficient remained to prove that the animal had been of\r\ngreat size. My informant measured the diameter [_qu._ circumference?]\r\nof the tusk, and found it to be eighteen inches.\r\n\r\n\"Though I should be very glad to take shelter under the convenient\r\n_Quien sabe_? the use of which I have suggested to you, I could not\r\navoid, at the time I was in Mexico, putting my isolated facts together,\r\nand feeling inclined to believe that this country had not only been\r\ninhabited in extremely remote times, when the valley bore a very\r\ndifferent aspect from that which it now exhibits, or which tradition\r\ngives it, but that the extinct race of enormous animals, whose remains\r\nwould seem, in the instance I have cited, to be coeval with the undated\r\nworks of man, may have been subjected to his will, and made\r\ninstrumental, by the application of their gigantic force, to the\r\ntransport of those vast masses of sculptured and chiselled rock which we\r\nmarvel to see lying in positions so far removed from their natural site.\r\n\r\n\"The existence of these ancient paved causeways also, not only from\r\ntheir solid construction over the flat and low plains of the valley, but\r\nas they may be traced running for miles over the dry table-land and the\r\nmountains, appears to me to lend plausibility to the supposition; as one\r\nmight inquire, to what end the labour of such works, in a country where\r\nbeasts of burden were unknown?\r\n\r\n\"But I leave this subject to wiser heads and bolder theorists. Had the\r\nMammoth of Chapingo been discovered with a ring in his nose, or a bit in\r\nhis mouth, a yoke on his head, or a crupper under his tail, the\r\nquestion would have been set at rest. As it is, there is plenty of room\r\nfor conjecture and dispute.\"[13]\r\n\r\nWith respect to the great extinct Mammalia of South America, we find Mr\r\nDarwin, to whom we are indebted for our knowledge of so many of them,\r\ncontinually expressing his wonder at the comparatively modern era of\r\ntheir existence. After having enumerated nine vast beasts, which he\r\nfound imbedded in the beach at Bahia Blanca, within the space of 200\r\nyards square, and remarked how numerous in kinds the ancient inhabitants\r\nof the country must have been, he observes that \"this enumeration\r\nbelongs to a very late tertiary period. From the bones of the\r\n_Scelidotherium_, including even the kneecap, being entombed in their\r\nproper relative positions, and from the osseous armour of the great\r\narmadillo-like animal being so well preserved, together with the bones\r\nof one of its legs, we may feel assured that these remains were fresh\r\nand united by their ligaments when deposited in the gravel with the\r\nshells. Hence we have good evidence that the above-enumerated gigantic\r\nquadrupeds, more different from those of the present day than the oldest\r\nof the tertiary quadrupeds of Europe, lived whilst the sea was peopled\r\nwith most of its present inhabitants.\"[14]\r\n\r\nOf the remains of the Mylodon, and of that strange semi-aquatic creature\r\nthe Toxodon, he says, they appeared so fresh that it was difficult to\r\nbelieve they had lain buried for ages under ground. The bones were so\r\nfresh, that they yielded, on careful analysis, seven per cent. of\r\nanimal matter, and when heated in the flame of a spirit-lamp, they not\r\nonly exhaled a very strong animal odour, but actually burned with a\r\nsmall flame.\r\n\r\nMr Darwin's interest was excited by the evidences everywhere present of\r\nthe immensity of this extinct population. \"The number of the remains\r\nimbedded in the great estuary-deposit which forms the Pampas, and covers\r\nthe gigantic rocks of Banda Oriental, must be extraordinarily great. I\r\nbelieve a straight line drawn in any direction through the Pampas would\r\ncut through some skeleton or bones.... We may suppose that the whole\r\narea of the Pampas is one wide sepulchre of these extinct gigantic\r\nquadrupeds.\"[15]\r\n\r\nThe whole plain of South America from the Rio Plata to the Straits of\r\nMagellan has been raised from the sea within the species-life of the\r\nexisting sea-shells, the old and weathered specimens of which, left on\r\nthe surface of the plain, still partially retain their colours! Darwin\r\ninfers, as certain, from data which he has adduced, that the Macrauchen,\r\nthat strange giraffe-necked pachyderm, lived _long after_ the sea was\r\ninhabited by its present shells, and when the vegetation of the land\r\ncould not have been other than it is now. And if the Macrauchen, then\r\nthe Toxodon, the Scelidothere, the Megathere, the Mylodon, the\r\nGlyptodon, the Glossothere, and all the rest of the quaint but mighty\r\nhost of gone giants, that once thronged these austral plains.\r\n\r\nEvidence for the recent existence of the colossal ostrich-like birds of\r\nNew Zealand is stronger still. It is about twenty-one years since the\r\nfirst intimation was given to scientific Europe of the remains of such\r\nanimals, through some bones sent by the Rev. W. Williams to Dr Buckland.\r\nFrom these, and a collection soon afterwards sent home, Professor Owen\r\nestablished the genus _Dinornis_, identifying five species, the largest\r\nof which, _D. giganteus_, he concluded to have stood about ten feet in\r\nheight. The remains have since been obtained in great profusion, and the\r\nresult of further investigations by the Professor has been the\r\nestablishment of three other genera, viz., _Palapteryx_, _Nestor_, and\r\n_Notornis_,--the latter a large bird allied to the Rails and Coots.\r\n\r\nA very interesting communication from Mr Williams accompanied one of the\r\nconsignments, extracts of which I will quote. It bears date \"Poverty\r\nBay, New Zealand, 17th May 1842.\" \"It is about three years ago, on\r\npaying a visit to this coast, south of the East Cape, that the natives\r\ntold me of some extraordinary monster, which they said was in existence\r\nin an inaccessible cavern on the side of a hill near the river Wairoa;\r\nand they shewed me at the same time some fragments of bone taken out of\r\nthe beds of rivers, which they said belonged to this creature, to which\r\nthey gave the name of _Moa_. When I came to reside in this neighbourhood\r\nI heard the same story a little enlarged; for it was said that this\r\ncreature _was still existing_ at the said hill, of which the name is\r\nWakapunake, and that it is guarded by a reptile of the Lizard species,\r\nbut I could not learn that any of the present generation had seen it. I\r\nstill considered the whole as an idle fable, but offered a large reward\r\nto any who would catch me either the bird or its protector.\" These\r\noffers procured the collection of a considerable number of fossil bones,\r\non which Mr Williams makes the following observations:--\r\n\r\n\"1. None of these bones have been found on the dry land, but are all of\r\nthem from the banks and beds of fresh-water rivers, buried only a little\r\ndistance in the mud.... All the streams are in immediate connexion with\r\nhills of some altitude.\r\n\r\n\"2. This bird was in existence here at no very distant time, though not\r\nin the memory of any of the inhabitants: for the bones are found in the\r\nbeds of the present streams, and do not appear to have been brought into\r\ntheir present situation by the action of any violent rush of waters.\r\n\r\n\"3. They existed in considerable numbers,--(an observation which has\r\nsince been abundantly confirmed.)\r\n\r\n\"4. It may be inferred that this bird was long-lived, and that it was\r\nmany years before it attained its full size. (The writer grounds this\r\ninference on the disparity in dimensions of the corresponding bones,\r\nsupposing that they all belonged to one and the same species; which,\r\nhowever, was an erroneous assumption.)\r\n\r\n\"5. The greatest height of the bird was probably not less than fourteen\r\nor sixteen feet. The leg-bones now sent give the height of six feet to\r\nthe root of the tail.\r\n\r\n\"Within the last few days I have obtained a piece of information worthy\r\nof notice. Happening to speak to an American about these bones, he told\r\nme that the bird is still in existence in the neighbourhood of Cloudy\r\nBay, in Cook's Straits. He said that the natives there had mentioned to\r\nan Englishman belonging to a whaling party, that there was a bird of\r\nextraordinary size to be seen only at night, on the side of a hill near\r\nthe place, and that he, with a native and a second Englishman, went to\r\nthe spot; that, after waiting some time, they saw the creature at a\r\nlittle distance, which they describe as being about fourteen or sixteen\r\nfeet high. One of the men proposed to go nearer and shoot, but his\r\ncompanion was so exceedingly terrified, or perhaps both of them, that\r\nthey were satisfied with looking at the bird, when, after a little time,\r\nit took the alarm, and strode off up the side of the mountain.\r\n\r\n\"This incident might not have been worth mentioning, had it not been for\r\nthe extraordinary agreement in point of the size of the bird [with my\r\ndeductions from the bones]. _Here_ are the bones which will satisfy you\r\nthat such a bird _has been_ in existence; and _there_ is said to be the\r\n_living bird_, the supposed size of which, given by an independent\r\nwitness, precisely agrees.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENCOUNTER WITH A MOA.]\r\n\r\nThe story told of the whaler appears to me to bear marks of truth. The\r\nbold essay to explore, the terror inspired by the gigantic figure,\r\nespecially in the solemnity of night, the description of the manners of\r\nthe bird running and striding, so like those of the Apteryx, with which\r\nits bones shew the Moa to have been closely allied, and the inglorious\r\nreturn of the party without achieving any exploit, are all too\r\nnatural to permit the thought that no more than inventive power has been\r\nat work.\r\n\r\nAnd well may the colossus have inspired fear. The bones sent to London\r\ngreatly exceed in bulk those of the largest horse. The leg-bone of a\r\ntall man is about one foot four inches in length, and the thigh of\r\nO'Brien, the Irish giant, whose skeleton, eight feet high, is mounted in\r\nthe Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, is not quite two feet. But\r\nthe leg-bone (_tibia_) of the _Dinornis_ we know measured as much as two\r\nfeet ten inches, and we have no reason to suppose, considering the\r\ndisparity that exists in the specimens examined, that we have seen by\r\nany means the largest.\r\n\r\nAdditional reason for supposing these magnificent birds to have existed\r\nnot long ago, is found in the fact that specimens of their eggs have\r\nbeen preserved. The circumstances attendant on the discovery and\r\nidentification of these possess a remarkable interest. In the volcanic\r\nsand of New Zealand Mr Walter Mantell found a gigantic egg, which we may\r\nreasonably infer to be that of either _Dinornis_ or _Palapteryx_, of the\r\nmagnitude of which he gives us a familiar idea by saying that his hat\r\nwould have been but just large enough to have served as an egg-cup for\r\nit. This is the statement of a man of science, and therefore we may\r\nassume an approximate degree of precision in the comparison.\r\n\r\nI do not know the size of Mr Mantell's hat, but I find that the\r\ntransverse diameter of my own is six inches or a little more. If we may\r\ntake this as the shorter diameter of the ovoid, the longer would\r\nprobably be about eight and a half inches; dimensions considerably\r\ngreater than those of the Ostrich's egg (which are about six and a\r\nquarter in length), but not what we should have expected from a bird\r\nfrom twelve to fourteen feet in height. And this the rather when we\r\nconsider that the egg of the New Zealand _Apteryx_, to which these birds\r\nmanifest a very close affinity, is one of dimensions that are quite\r\nsurprising in proportion to the bulk of the bird. The Apteryx is about\r\nas big as a turkey, standing two feet in height, but its egg measures\r\nfour inches ten lines by three inches two lines in the respective\r\ndiameters. The egg of the _Dinornis giganteus_, to bear the same ratio\r\nto the bird as this, would be of the incredible length of two feet and a\r\nhalf, by a breadth of one and three quarters! Possibly this specimen,\r\nthough indubitably the egg of one of this great family of extinct birds,\r\nmay after all be that of one of the subordinate species.\r\n\r\nBut about the same time as Mr Mantell's discovery, one of equal interest\r\nwas made in Madagascar. The master of a French ship obtained, in 1850,\r\nfrom natives of the island, three eggs, of far greater size, and\r\nfragments of the leg-bones of an immense bird. These, on their arrival\r\nat Paris, formed the subjects of valuable investigations by M. Isidore\r\nGeoffroy St Hilaire[16] and Professor Owen.[17]\r\n\r\nThe native statement was, that one of the eggs had been found entire in\r\nthe bed of a torrent, among the debris of a land-slip; that a second\r\negg, with some fragments of bone, was subsequently found in a formation\r\n_which is stated to be alluvial_; a third egg, which the natives had\r\nperforated at one end, and used as a vessel, was also found. This last\r\negg was broken in the carriage, the other two arrived in Europe entire.\r\n\r\nThese two, though nearly alike in size, differed considerably in their\r\nrelative proportions and shape, the one being shorter and thicker, with\r\nmore equal ends than the other. The following table shews the dimensions\r\nof both compared with those of an ostrich's egg:--\r\n\r\n                           Ovoid egg.   Ellipsoid egg.   Ostrich egg.\r\n                          ft. in. li.    ft. in. li.      ft. in. li.\r\nLonger circumference       2  10   9      2   9   6        1   6   0\r\nShorter circumference      2   4   3      2   5   6        1   4   6\r\nExtreme length             1   0   8      1   0   5        0   6   4\r\n\r\nM. Geoffroy St Hilaire estimates the larger of the two to contain 10-1/8\r\nquarts, or the contents of nearly six eggs of the Ostrich, or sixteen of\r\nthe Cassowary, or a hundred and forty-eight of the Hen, or fifty\r\nthousand of the Humming bird.[18]\r\n\r\nThe fragments of bone indicated a bird of the same natural affinities as\r\nthe New Zealand colossi, and of dimensions not widely remote from\r\ntheirs. Professor Owen thinks that it did not exceed in height or size\r\n_Dinornis giganteus_, and that there is a probability that it was\r\nslightly smaller. The Madagascar bird has been named _Æpyornis\r\nmaximus_.\r\n\r\nThe fragments of the egg of the New Zealand bird (still uncertain as to\r\nthe species to which it is to be referred) shew that the shell was\r\nabsolutely thinner, and therefore relatively _much_ thinner than that of\r\nthe Ostrich's egg; the air-pores, too, have a different form, being\r\nlinear, instead of round, and the surface is smoother. In these\r\nqualities, the New Zealand egg resembles that of the _Apteryx_; in the\r\nthickness and roughness of the egg of _Æpyornis_ there is more\r\nsimilarity to those of the Ostrich and Cassowary. The colour of the\r\nMadagascar egg is a dull greyish yellow; but it is possible that this\r\nmay be derived from the soil in which it has long been imbedded. The\r\nfragments of the New Zealand egg are white, like the eggs of the\r\n_Apteryx_ and Ostrich: those of the Emu and Cassowary are light green.\r\n\r\nThe willing fancy suggests the possibility that, in an island of such\r\nimmensity as Madagascar, possessing lofty mountain-ranges, covered with\r\nthe most magnificent forests, where civilised man has only yet touched\r\none or two spots on the seaward borders, but where these slight\r\nexplorations have educed so many wondrous animals, so many strange forms\r\nof vegetable life, the noble _Æpyornis_ may yet be stalking with giant\r\nstride along the fern-fringed hill-sides, or through the steaming\r\nthickets; though in the more contracted area of New Zealand its equally\r\nponderous cousins, the _Dinornis_ and the _Palapteryx_, may have sunk\r\nbeneath the persevering persecutions of man.\r\n\r\nYet another item of evidence bearing on the recent if not present\r\nexistence of these great fowls has recently come to light:--the most\r\ninteresting discovery that one of the genera whose fossil remains had\r\nbeen found associated with theirs is really extant in New Zealand. I\r\nrefer to the _Notornis_.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Zoological Society of London, held on the 13th\r\nNovember 1850, Dr Mantell made the following communication relative to\r\nthis discovery:--\r\n\r\n\"It was in the course of last year, on the occasion of my son's second\r\nvisit to the south of the middle island, that he had the good fortune to\r\nsecure the recent _Notornis_, which I now submit, having previously\r\nplaced it in the hands of the eminent ornithologist Mr Gould, to figure\r\nand describe. This bird was taken by some sealers who were pursuing\r\ntheir avocations in Dusky Bay. Perceiving the trail of a large and\r\nunknown bird on the snow, with which the ground was then covered, they\r\nfollowed the footprints till they obtained a sight of the _Notornis_,\r\nwhich their dogs instantly pursued, and, after a long chase, caught\r\nalive in the gully of a sound behind Resolution Island. It ran with\r\ngreat speed, and on being captured uttered loud screams, and fought and\r\nstruggled violently. It was kept alive three or four days on board the\r\nschooner, and then killed, and the body roasted and eaten by the crew,\r\neach partaking of the dainty, which was declared to be delicious. The\r\nbeak and legs were of a bright red colour. My son secured the skin,\r\ntogether with very fine specimens of the Kapapo or ground parrot\r\n(_Strigops_), a pair of Huias (_Neomorpha_), and two species of\r\nKiwikiwi, namely _Apteryx Australis_, and _A. Oweni_. The latter very\r\nrare bird is now added to the collection of the British Museum.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr Walter Mantell states, that, according to the native traditions, a\r\nlarge Rail was contemporary with the Moa, and formed a principal article\r\nof food among their ancestors. It was known to the North Islanders by\r\nthe name 'Moho,' and to the South Islanders by that of 'Takahe;' but the\r\nbird was considered by both natives and Europeans to have been long\r\nsince exterminated by the wild cats and dogs; not an individual having\r\nbeen seen or heard of since the arrival of the English colonists. On\r\ncomparing the head of the bird with the fossil cranium, and mandibles,\r\nand the figures and descriptions in the 'Zoological Transactions' (Plate\r\nlvi.), my son was at once convinced of their identity. It may not be\r\nirrelevant to add, that in the course of Mr Walter Mantell's journey\r\nfrom Banks's Peninsula along the coast to Otago, he learned from the\r\nnatives that they believed there still existed in that country the only\r\nindigenous terrestrial quadruped, except a species of rat, which there\r\nare any reasonable grounds for concluding New Zealand ever possessed.\r\nWhile encamping at Arowenua, in the district of Timaru, the Maoris\r\nassured them that about ten miles inland there was a quadruped which\r\nthey called Káureke, and that it was formerly abundant, and often kept\r\nby their ancestors in a domestic state as a pet animal. It was described\r\nas about two feet in length, with coarse grizzly hair; and must have\r\nmore nearly resembled the otter or badger than the beaver or the\r\nOrnithorhynchus, which the first accounts seem to suggest as the\r\nprobable type. The offer of a liberal reward induced some of the Maoris\r\nto start for the interior of the country where the Káureke was supposed\r\nto be located; but they returned without having obtained the slightest\r\ntrace of the existence of such an animal. My son, however, expresses his\r\nbelief in the native accounts, and that, if the creature no longer\r\nexists, its extermination is of very recent date. In concluding this\r\nbrief narrative of the discovery of a genus of birds once contemporary\r\nwith the colossal Moa, and hitherto only known by its fossil remains, I\r\nbeg to remark that this highly interesting fact tends to confirm the\r\nconclusions expressed in my communication to the Geological Society,\r\nnamely, that the _Dinornis_, _Palapteryx_, and related forms, were\r\ncoeval with some of the existing species of birds peculiar to New\r\nZealand, and that their final extinction took place at no very distant\r\nperiod, and long after the advent of the aboriginal Maoris.\"\r\n\r\nMr Gould then read a paper pointing out the zoological characters of the\r\nbird discovered by Mr Mantell, which he had no hesitation in identifying\r\nas the species formerly characterised, from its osseous remains, by\r\nProfessor Owen, under the name of _Notornis Mantelli_. Mr Gould, in\r\nadverting to the extreme interest with which the present existence of a\r\nspecies which was certainly contemporary with the Moa must be regarded,\r\npointed out, from the preserved skin, which was on the table, how\r\naccurate a prevision of its character had been made by Professor Owen,\r\nwhen investigating the fragments from which our first knowledge of it\r\nhad been derived.[19]\r\n\r\nAt length I come home to Great Britain and Ireland--the \"nice little,\r\ntight little islands\" where so many of our sympathies properly centre,\r\nwhere natural-history facts and all other facts interest us so much more\r\nthan parallel facts elsewhere, and where, above all, there are so many\r\nmore lights streaming into the darkness, and bringing out truth. Let us\r\nagain look back to the period of the Bison, and Reindeer, and Elk, of\r\nthe Elephant, and Hippopotamus, and Rhinoceros, of the Lion and the\r\nHyena, and the great Cave Bear, and search among the vanishing traces of\r\nthe far past for glimpses of evidence when their age ceased to be.\r\n\r\nSome dim light falls on the obscurity from the discovery of the fossil\r\nremains of man himself--the human bones found by Dr Schmerling in a\r\ncavern near Liege, the remains mentioned by M. Marcel de Serres and\r\nothers in several caverns in France, associated with fossil relics of\r\nthis period. But more from the occurrence of flints, apparently\r\nfashioned by human art, in superficial deposits, together with the same\r\nextinct fossils of the tertiary. Even at the very moment that I write\r\nthis sheet, my eye falls on the report[20] of an important meeting of\r\nthe Ethnological Society, for the purpose of discussing this very\r\nsubject of \"The flint implements found associated with the bones of\r\nextinct animals in the Drift.\" Many of the leading geologists and\r\narchæologists were present, for the matter has become one of absorbing\r\ninterest, conflicting, as the facts seem to do, with some assumptions\r\nreceived as unquestioned verities in Geology.\r\n\r\nThese flints, which seem indubitably to have been chipped into the forms\r\nof arrow-heads, lance-heads, and the like, have been found in France in\r\nlarge numbers, as also in other parts of the continent, and in England.\r\nThey resemble those still used by some savage tribes. In this very\r\nneighbourhood, as in the cavern called Kent's Hole near Torquay, and in\r\none more recently examined at Brixham, they are found mixed up with the\r\nbones of the Rhinoceros, of the Cave Bear, and the Hyena, At\r\nMenchecourt, near Abbeville, they occur in a deposit of sand, sandy\r\nclay, and marl, with bones of the same animals, and others, their\r\ncontemporaries. Concerning this bed, Mr Prestwich, in a paper read\r\nbefore the Royal Society, May 26, 1859, says that it must be referred to\r\nthose usually designated as post pliocene, but that the period of its\r\ndeposit was anterior to that of the surface assuming its present\r\noutline, so far as some of its minor features are concerned. \"He does\r\nnot, however, consider that the facts of necessity carry man back in\r\npast time more than they _bring forward the great extinct mammals\r\ntowards our own time_, the evidence having reference only to relative,\r\nand not to absolute time; and he is of opinion that many of the later\r\ngeological changes may have been sudden, or of shorter duration than\r\ngenerally considered. In fact, from the evidence here exhibited, and\r\nfrom all that he knows regarding the drift phenomena generally, the\r\nauthor sees no reason against the conclusion that this period of man and\r\nthe extinct mammals--supposing their contemporaneity to be proved--was\r\nbrought to a sudden end by a temporary inundation of the land; on the\r\ncontrary, he sees much to support such a view on purely geological\r\nconsiderations.\"[21]\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the Ethnological Society just held, there seems to\r\nhave been an increasing tendency to admit the hypothesis of the\r\ncontinuance of the Mammalia of the Tertiary into the human era. Mr\r\nEvans, who exhibited specimens taken at a depth of twenty to thirty\r\nfeet, from a stratum of coarse fresh-water gravel, lying on chalk, and\r\ncontaining an entire skeleton of an extinct Rhinoceros, and overlaid by\r\nsandy marl containing existing shells, shewed that the deposit had\r\ncertainly not been disturbed till the present time, so that the gravel,\r\nthe bones, and the flints had been deposited coetaneously. He suggested\r\n\"that the animals supposed to have become extinct before man was created\r\nmight have continued to exist to more recent periods than had been\r\nadmitted.\" And this opinion found support from other leading geologists.\r\n\r\nThat this conclusion would throw the existence of man to an era far\r\nhigher than that assigned to him by the inspired Word, is, I know,\r\ngenerally held; and certain investigations, made in the alluvial deposit\r\nof the Nile,[22] are considered to prove that man has been living in a\r\nstate of comparative civilisation in the Nile Valley for the last\r\n13,500 years. But that conclusion absolutely rests on the supposition\r\nthat the rate of increase formed by the annual deposit of the Nile mud\r\nhas been always exactly the same as now,--a supposition, not only\r\nwithout the least shadow of proof, but also directly contrary to the\r\nhighest probability, nay, certainty, in the estimation of those who\r\nbelieve in the Noachian deluge. For surely the drainage of the entire\r\nplain of North Africa after that inundation must have produced an\r\nalluvium of vast thickness in a very brief time; while beneath that\r\ndeposit the works of the antediluvian world might well be buried. Yet\r\nthe possibility of there ever having been any greater rate of deposit\r\nthan within the last 3000 years, the recorder of those investigations,\r\nin his unseemly haste to prove the Bible false, strangely leaves wholly\r\nout of his consideration.\r\n\r\nSo, doubtless, concerning other deposits containing fossil remains,\r\nwhose extreme antiquity is assumed from the known rate of\r\nsurface-increase now, we ought to remember that we have not a tittle of\r\nproof that the rate of increase has not at certain remote periods been\r\nsuddenly and immensely augmented. There are many facts on record which\r\ntend to shew that the rate at which geologic changes take place in\r\ncertain localities affords no reliable data whatever to infer that at\r\nwhich phenomena apparently quite parallel have occurred in other\r\nlocalities. An upheaval or a subsidence of one part of a country may\r\nrapidly effect a great change in the amount of soil or gravel\r\nprecipitated by streams, without destroying or changing their channels,\r\nand yet the deposit may be made sufficiently gradually to allow the\r\nburial of shells or of bones of creatures which lived and died on the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nThe degradation of a cliff, either suddenly or gradually, might throw a\r\nvast quantity of fragments into a rapid stream, and cause a deposit of\r\ngravel of considerable breadth and thickness in a comparatively short\r\nperiod of time,--say a century or two.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell has adduced examples of very rapid formation of\r\ncertain stony deposits, which should make us cautious how we assert that\r\nsuch and such a thickness _must_ have required a vast number of years.\r\nIn one of them there is a thickness of 200 or 300 feet of travertine of\r\nrecent deposit, while in another, a solid mass _thirty feet thick was\r\ndeposited in about twenty years_. There are countless places in Italy\r\nwhere the formation of limestone may be seen, as also in Auvergne and\r\nother volcanic districts.[23]\r\n\r\nFrom these and similar considerations it seems to me by no means\r\nunreasonable that the four thousand years which elapsed between the\r\nCreation and the commencement of Western European history should have\r\nbeen amply sufficient for many of those geological operations whose\r\nresults are seen in what are known as the later Tertiary deposits,--the\r\ncrag, the drift, the cavern-accumulations, and the like. And, as a\r\ncorollary to this, that the great extinct Mammalia may have extended\r\ninto this period, and thus have been contemporary with man, for a\r\ngreater or less duration, according to the species; some, probably,\r\nhaving been extinguished at a very early period of the era, while others\r\nlived on to the time I have named, or even later.\r\n\r\nBut have we nothing better for this conclusion than an assumption of the\r\npossibility, and a more or less probable conjecture? Yes; we have some\r\nfacts of interest to warrant it, or I should not have ventured to\r\nintroduce the subject in this work. There are facts,--besides the\r\nadmixture of human workmanship with the animal remains in undisturbed\r\ndeposits--direct evidence, not altogether shadowy, of the co-existence\r\nof the extinct animals with living men.\r\n\r\nAnd first, I would mention some circumstances bearing analogy to the\r\nexhumation of the fresh Pachyderms of Siberia. Some years ago, a portion\r\nof the leg of an Irish Elk, so-called, (_Megaceros hibernicus_,) with a\r\npart of the tendons, skin, and hair upon it, was dug up with other\r\nremains from a deposit on the estate of H. Grogan Morgan, Esq., of\r\nJohnstown Castle, Wexford, and is now in that gentleman's possession.\r\nThis leg was exhibited, and formed the subject of a lecture at the time\r\nby Mr Peile, veterinary surgeon, Dublin.\r\n\r\nIt has been ascertained that the marrow in some of the bones blazes like\r\na candle; that the cartilage and gelatine, so far from having been\r\ndestroyed, were not apparently altered by time.[24] Archdeacon Maunsell\r\nactually made soup of the bones, and presented a portion thereof to the\r\nRoyal Dublin Society (whether they enjoyed it I have not heard; it must\r\nhave been \"a little high,\" I fear). They are frequently used by the\r\npeasantry for fuel. On the occasion of the rejoicings for the victory at\r\nWaterloo, a bonfire was made of these bones, and it was observed that\r\nthey gave out as good a blaze as those of horses, often used for similar\r\npurposes.[25]\r\n\r\nPepper, in his \"History of Ireland,\" states that the ancient Irish used\r\nto hunt a very large black deer, the milk of which they used as we do\r\nthat of the cow, and the flesh of which served them for food, and the\r\nskin for clothing. This is a very remarkable record; and is confirmed by\r\nsome bronze tablets found by Sir William Betham, the inscriptions on\r\nwhich attested that the ancient Irish fed upon the milk and flesh of a\r\ngreat black deer.\r\n\r\nAccording to the \"Annals of the Four Masters,\" Niel Sedamin, a king of\r\nIreland before the Christian era, was so called because \"the cows and\r\nthe female deer were alike milked in his reign.\" The art of taming the\r\nwild deer and converting them into domestic cattle is said to have been\r\nintroduced by Flidisia, this monarch's mother. Deer are said to have\r\nbeen used to carry stones and wood for Codocus when his monastery was\r\nbuilt, as also to carry timber to build the castle of a king of\r\nConnaught. These may have been red deer, but as there is good proof\r\nthat the giant deer was really domesticated, it seems more likely that\r\nsuch offices should have been performed by the latter than by the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\nAn interesting letter from the Countess of Moira, published in the\r\n\"Archæologia Britannica,\" gives an account of a human body found in\r\ngravel under eleven feet of peat, soaked in the bog-water; it was in\r\ngood preservation, and completely clothed in antique garments of\r\ndeer-hair, conjectured to be that of the Giant Elk.\r\n\r\nA skull of the same animal has been discovered in Germany in an ancient\r\ndrain, together with several urns and stone-hatchets. And in the museum\r\nof the Royal Dublin Society there exists a fossil rib bearing evident\r\ntoken of having been wounded by some sharp instrument which remained\r\nlong infixed in the wound, but had not penetrated so deep as to destroy\r\nthe creature's life. It was such a wound as the head of an arrow,\r\nwhether of flint or of metal, would produce.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1846, a very interesting corroboration of the opinion long\r\nheld by some that the great broad-horned Deer was domesticated by the\r\nancient Irish, was given by the discovery of a vast collection of bones\r\nat Lough Gûr, near Limerick. The word Gûr is said to mean \"an\r\nassemblage,\" so that the locality is \"the Lake of the Assemblage,\"\r\ncommemorating perhaps the gathering of an army or some other host at the\r\nspot. In the midst of the lake is an island, which is described as being\r\nso completely surrounded with bones and skulls of animals \"that one\r\nwould think the cattle of an entire nation must have been slaughtered to\r\nprocure so vast an assemblage.\"\r\n\r\nThe skulls are described as belonging to the following animals:--The\r\ngiant deer (females); a deer of inferior size; the stag; another species\r\nof stag; the fallow deer; the broad-faced ox; the hollow-faced ox; the\r\nlong-faced ox; another species of ox; the common short-horned ox; the\r\ngoat; and the hog.\r\n\r\nThe principal points of interest centred in the Giant Deer or so-called\r\nIrish Elk. The skulls of these, as of all the larger animals, \"were\r\nbroken in by some sharp and heavy instrument, and in the same manner as\r\nbutchers of the present day slaughter cattle for our markets, and in\r\nmany cases the marrow-bones were broken across, as if to get at the\r\nmarrow.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, if this was indubitable, the conclusion was inevitable, that\r\nthe Giant Deer was not only contemporary with man, but was domesticated\r\nby him with other quadrupeds, and used for food. Professor Owen,\r\nhowever, contended that the skulls of the Giant Deer were not females\r\nbut males, from which the horns had been forcibly removed, and that the\r\nholes in the foreheads were made by the violent wrenching off of the\r\nhorns tearing away a portion of the frontal bone from which they grew.\r\n\r\nIn reply to this opinion, Mr H. D. Richardson of Dublin, whose personal\r\nacquaintance with the relics of this noble species is peculiarly\r\nextensive, shewed that certain variations of proportion on which the\r\nlearned Professor relied to prove the skulls to be male, were of no\r\nsuch value, individual animals presenting great discrepancies in these\r\nrespects: that the total absence of cornuous peduncles from the sides of\r\nthe forehead, and of the elevated bony ridge, conclusively proved the\r\nsex to be female, which was permanently destitute of horns; and that in\r\nno case could it be said that the ridge was forced away, since the\r\nviolence was confined to a _small hole_ in the centre of the forehead.\r\n\r\nTo put the matter to test, Mr Richardson experimented on two perfect\r\nmale skulls. In the one instance the force was applied to the beam of\r\nthe horns, and the result was their fracture where they are united to\r\nthe peduncles. In the other case the force was applied to the peduncles\r\nthemselves, to ascertain whether it was possible to wrench them and the\r\nridge away from the face, when the consequence was, that the skull was\r\ncompletely riven asunder. Indeed to any one who looks at the position of\r\nthe horns in this animal, and their implantation, it must be\r\nself-evident that their violent removal must tear away the entire\r\nforehead, and not leave a central hole. Mr Edward Newman who\r\nsubsequently examined the specimens speaks decidedly on this point:--\"I\r\nhave not the least hesitation in expressing my firm conviction that the\r\nfractures were the result of human hands, and were the cause of the\r\ndeath of the animals. These two fractured skulls correspond too exactly\r\nwith each other, and with that of a bullock with which I compared them,\r\nto have resulted from accident: the edges of the fractures wore the\r\nappearance of having been coeval with the interment or submergence of\r\nthe skulls, and presented a very strikingly different appearance from a\r\nfracture recently made, and which I had the opportunity of examining.\r\nThere were several skulls of the male of the same species, one bearing\r\nenormous antlers, but none exhibiting the slightest trace of frontal\r\nfracture.\"[26]\r\n\r\nA circumstance of much importance is that these skulls were found in\r\ncompany with those of many well-known domestic animals, as the ox, the\r\ngoat, and the hog. _These skulls were similarly fractured._ As it is\r\nevident that _their_ demolition was produced by the butcher's pole-axe,\r\nwhy not that of the elk-skulls?\r\n\r\n\"At the first cursory glance, it may appear somewhat strange that the\r\nskulls of the males should invariably have been found entire, and that\r\neven the recent discovery at Lough Gûr should form no exception.\r\n\r\n\"I do not, however, find any difficulty here. In the first place, we may\r\nfairly suppose that males, like our bulls, were not equally prized as\r\nfood. In the second place, the size, as well as the position of the\r\nantlers, would render it next to an impossibility to give the desired\r\nblow with the pole-axe. In the third place, the greater strength and\r\nthickness of the skull would almost to a certainty render the blow\r\nunavailing; and in the fourth place, supposing the females domesticated,\r\nand the occasional tenants of sheds and other buildings, we may well\r\nimagine that the males were excluded from such buildings by the enormous\r\nsize of their antlers. Perhaps a few only of the males, as in our\r\ncattle, were suffered to become adult, one male sufficing for many\r\nfemales. Perhaps the males were allowed free range, the females only\r\nbeing permitted at stated seasons to accompany them. In fine, the more\r\nwe investigate probabilities, the more we reason from present experience\r\nand knowledge, the less difficulty shall we find in the way of believing\r\nthe gigantic deer of Ireland an animal coeval with man and subservient\r\nto his uses.\"[27]\r\n\r\nIn a communication subsequently made to the _Zoologist_ by Mr\r\nRichardson, he gives the following additional evidence:--\"In the\r\ncollection of the late Mr Johnston, of Down, which had been left by his\r\nuncle, an attorney, and in which everything was labelled with the\r\naccuracy and precision of that profession, is a small brass spear, with\r\na piece of wood still in the socket, with a label, stating it to have\r\nbeen found in a marl-pit, among the bones of a deer. An excise-officer\r\ntold me that he saw, found in a marl-pit, at Mentrim in Meath, the\r\nskeleton of a deer, and a man, and a long knife: the latter, I believe,\r\nis rather a short sword, now, I think, in the collection of Mr Petrie,\r\nof Dublin, who told me that some such tradition had accompanied it into\r\nhis possession.... Dr Martin informs me that on the banks of the river\r\nSuir, near Portland, Waterford, and on nearly every farm, are found,\r\nnear springs, spaces of frequently seventy feet in diameter, consisting\r\nof stones, broken up as if for roads, and lying together in a mass.\r\nThese stones were evidently purposely broken, and all much of one size,\r\nand are charred. These spaces are many feet in depth. The tradition\r\nrespecting them is current among the peasantry, that here in olden time,\r\na great deer was killed and baked in these stone-pits, the stones having\r\nbeen previously heated like a kiln, and they also distinguish the animal\r\nas the 'Irish Elk.' These places are called in Irish by a name\r\nsignifying the 'Buck's Den.'\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPEARING THE ANCIENT ELK.]\r\n\r\nFrom all these testimonies combined, can we hesitate a moment in\r\nbelieving that the Giant Deer was an inhabitant of Ireland since its\r\ncolonisation by man? It seems to me that its extinction cannot have\r\ntaken place more than a thousand years ago. Perhaps at the very time\r\nthat Cæsar invaded Britain the Celts in the sister isle were milking and\r\nslaughtering their female elks, domesticated in their cattlepens of\r\ngranite, and hunting the proud-antlered male with their flint arrows and\r\nlances. It would appear, that the mode of hunting him was to chase and\r\nterrify him into pools and swamps, such as the marl-pits then were;\r\nthat, having thus disabled him in the yielding bogs, and slain him, the\r\nhead was cut off, as of too little value to be worth the trouble of\r\ndragging home; that the under jaws and tongue were cut off; and that\r\nfrequently the entire carcase was disjointed on the spot, the best parts\r\nonly being removed. This would account for the so frequent occurrence of\r\nseparate portions of the skeleton, and especially of skulls, in the\r\nbog-earth. No doubt so large an animal would not long survive in a state\r\nof freedom, after an island so limited in extent as Ireland became\r\npeopled throughout; and supposing the females to have been\r\ndomesticated, it is quite conceivable that the difficulty or even danger\r\nof capturing or domesticating the males, may have caused the species\r\nsoon to become extinct in captivity, when it no longer continued to\r\nexist in a wild state. Thus we may perhaps account for the certainly\r\nremarkable fact that no native Irish name has been recognised as\r\nbelonging to it;--remarkable, because the Irish tongue is particularly\r\nrich in distinctive names for natural objects. There exists a very\r\ncurious ancient poem in that language which professes to enumerate the\r\nwhole fauna of the island. It is founded on the legend that Fian\r\nMacCumhaill was made prisoner by Cormac MacArt, king of Erinn; that the\r\nvictor promised to give him freedom on condition that, as a ransom, a\r\npair of each wild animal found in Ireland were brought before him on the\r\ngreen of Tara. Cailte MacRonain, the foster-brother of the captive\r\ngeneral undertook the task, and succeeded in bringing the collection\r\nbefore the king within a twelvemonth; and in the poem, he is supposed to\r\nnarrate to St Patrick the detail and result of his enterprise. Of this\r\npoem, which is considered to be as early as the ninth century, the\r\nreader may like to see the following translation by Mr Eugene Curry,\r\ncontaining the zoological portion:--\r\n\r\n      \"I then went forth to search the lands,\r\n        To see if I could redeem my chief,\r\n      And soon returned to noble Tara,\r\n        With the ransom that Cormac required.\r\n\r\n      \"I brought with me the fierce _Geilt_,[28]\r\n        And the tall _Grib_[29] with talons,\r\n      And the two Ravens of Fid-dá-Beann,\r\n        And the two Ducks of Loch Saileann.\r\n\r\n      \"Two Foxes from Sliabh Cuilinn,\r\n        Two Wild Oxen[30] from Burren,\r\n      Two Swans from the dark wood of Gabhran,\r\n        And two Cuckoos from the wood of Fordrum.\r\n\r\n      \"Two _Toghmalls_[31] from Fidh-Gaibhle,\r\n        Which is by the side of the two roads,\r\n      And two Otters after them,\r\n        From the brown-white rock of Dobhar.\r\n\r\n      \"Two Gulls from Tralee hither,\r\n        Two _Ruilechs_[32] from Port Lairge (Waterford),\r\n      Four _Snags_[33] from the River Brosna,\r\n        Two Plovers from the rock of Dunán.\r\n\r\n      \"Two _Echtachs_[34] from the lofty Echtghe,\r\n        Two Thrushes from Letter Longarie,\r\n      Two _Drenns_[35] from Dun Aife,\r\n        The two _Cainches_[36] of Corraivte.\r\n\r\n      \"Two Herons from the hilly Corann,\r\n        The two _Errfiachs_[37] of Magh Fobhair,\r\n      The two Eagles of Carrick-na-Cloch,\r\n        Two Hawks from the wood of Caenach.\r\n\r\n      \"Two Pheasants from Loch Meilge,\r\n        Two Water-hens from Loch Eirne,\r\n      Two Heath-hens from the Bog of Mafa,\r\n        Two Swift Divers from Dubh Loch.\r\n\r\n      \"Two _Cricharans_[38] from Cualann,\r\n        Two Titmice from Magh Tualang,\r\n      Two Choughs from Gleann Gaibhle,\r\n        Two Sparrows from the Shannon.\r\n\r\n      \"Two Cormorants from Ath Cliath,\r\n        Two _Onchus_[39] from Crotta Cliach,\r\n      Two Jackdaws from Druim Damh,\r\n        Two _Riabhogs_[40] from Leathan Mhaigh.\r\n\r\n      \"Two Rabbits from Dumho Duinn,\r\n        Two wild Hogs from circular Cnoghbha,\r\n      Two _Peatáns_[41] from Creat Roe,\r\n        Two wild Boars[42] from green-sided Tara.\r\n\r\n      \"Two Pigeons out of Ceis Corann,\r\n        Two Blackbirds out of Leitir Finnchoill,\r\n      Two black Birds (?) from the strand of Dabhan,\r\n        Two Roebucks from Luachair Deaghaidh.\r\n\r\n      \"Two _Fereidhins_[43] from Ath Loich,\r\n        Two Fawns from Moin mor,\r\n      Two Bats out of the Cave of Cnoghbha,\r\n        Two Pigs[44] from the lands of Ollarbha.\r\n\r\n      \"Two Swallows out of Sidh Buidhe,\r\n        Two _Iaronns_[45] from the wood of Luadraidh,\r\n      Two _Geisechtachs_[46] from Magh Mall,\r\n        Two charming Robins from Cnamh Choill.\r\n\r\n      \"Two Woodcocks from Coillruadh,\r\n        Two Crows from Lenn Uar,\r\n      Two _Bruacharans_[47] from Sliabh-da-Ean,\r\n        Two Barnacle-Geese from Turloch Bruigheoil.\r\n\r\n      \"Two _Naescans_[48] from Dun Daighre,\r\n        Two Yellow-ammers from the brink of Bairne,\r\n      Two _Spireogs_[49] from Sliabh Cleath,\r\n        Two Grey Mice from Limerick.\r\n\r\n      \"Two Corncrakes from the Banks of Shannon,\r\n        Two Wagtails from the brinks of Birra,\r\n      Two Curlews from the Harbour of Galway,\r\n        Two _Sgreachógs_[50] from Muirtheimhne.\r\n\r\n      \"Two _Geilt Glinnes_[51] from Glenn-a-Smoil,\r\n        Two Jackdaws from great Ath Mogha,\r\n      Two fleet _Onchus_[52] from Loch Con,\r\n        Two Cats out of the Cave of Cruachain.\r\n\r\n      \"Two Goats from Sith Gabhran,\r\n        Two Pigs[53] of the Pigs of Mac Lir,\r\n      A Ram and Ewe both round and red,\r\n        I brought with me from Aengus.\r\n\r\n      \"I brought with me a Stallion and a Mare,\r\n        From the beautiful stud of Manannan,\r\n      A Bull and a white Cow from Druim Cain,\r\n        Which were given me by Muirn Munchain.\"\r\n\r\nNo _known_ allusion occurs in this poem to the Giant Deer.[54] First,\r\nhowever, we must remember that no small number of the animals mentioned\r\nare quite unrecognisable; and that of those names to which an\r\nexplanation is given, many are probably incorrectly rendered. Secondly,\r\nif it could be absolutely shewn that no allusion exists to that fine\r\nbeast, it would not at all disprove its existence a thousand years\r\nbefore. Supposing that the _Megaceros_ became extinct soon after the\r\ncolonisation of Ireland, and that this was several centuries before the\r\nChristian era, the distinctive name by which it had been known might\r\nwell have died out and become extinct also, among a people unacquainted\r\nwith letters. Or if a dim tradition of the animal and of its name still\r\nlingered here and there, it might well be omitted from a catalogue which\r\nprofessed to give the creatures actually collected in a living state at\r\na given period. It would have been interesting to have been able to\r\nidentify the Great Elk, but its introduction would have been a glaring\r\nanachronism.\r\n\r\nThe enumeration of nearly a hundred and sixty quadrupeds and birds\r\neither indigenous to or naturalised in Ireland at so early a period,\r\npossesses, I say, a peculiar interest.\r\n\r\nIf the editor's suggestion is correct, that the _Echtach_ was a bovine\r\nanimal, then we have three distinct mentions of this family in the\r\npoem,--the Wild Oxen, the Echtachs, and the Bull and White Cow. The\r\nsecond and third of these were probably domesticated animals; the first\r\none expressly \"Wild.\" Now at least five distinct species of Oxen are\r\nknown to have inhabited Europe and the British Isles during the later\r\nperiods of the Tertiary era, which have been named respectively, _Bison\r\npriscus_, _Bos primigenius_, _frontosus_ and _longifrons_, and _Ovibos\r\nmoschatus_. Of these, skulls of _Bos frontosus_ and _B. longifrons_ have\r\nbeen dug up in some numbers in Ireland. Some of these bear, in the\r\nperforation of the forehead, evident proof of having been slaughtered\r\n_secundum artem_, and therefore of having been domesticated. But one\r\nlarge skull of the _longifrons_ type, now in the Museum of the Royal\r\nIrish Academy, has a cut in the forehead, into which can be accurately\r\nfitted several of the narrow bronze \"celts,\" or arrow-heads so\r\nfrequently dug up in Ireland; a pretty fair proof that this animal was\r\nkilled by the hunter's arrow, and was therefore wild.\r\n\r\nNo bovine animals of the true taurine race are now known to exist in an\r\naboriginally wild state; but at the epoch of our earliest historical\r\nknowledge of central and western Europe it was far otherwise. Cæsar,\r\ndescribing, under the name of _Urus_, certain wild oxen of the great\r\nHercynian forest, says, \"These Uri are little inferior to elephants in\r\nsize, but are bulls in their nature, colour, and figure. Great is their\r\nstrength, and great their swiftness, nor do they spare man or beast when\r\nonce they have caught sight of him. These, when trapped in pitfalls, the\r\nhunters unsparingly kill. The youths, exercising themselves by this sort\r\nof hunting, are hardened by the toil, and those among them who have\r\nkilled most, bringing with them the horns, as testimonials, acquire\r\ngreat praise. But these Uri cannot be habituated to man, nor made\r\ntractable, not even when taken young. The great size of the horns, as\r\nwell as the form and quality of them, differs much from those of our\r\noxen.\"\r\n\r\nIt is probable that this race extended widely over Europe, and even into\r\nAsia. Herodotus mentions Macedonian wild oxen, with exceedingly large\r\n([Greek: hypermegathia]) horns; and Philip of Macedon killed a wild bull\r\nin Mount Orbela, which had made great havoc, and produced much terror\r\namong the inhabitants; its spoils he hung up in the Temple of Hercules.\r\nThe Assyrian artists delighted to sculpture on the royal bas-reliefs of\r\nNineveh the conquest of the wild bull by the prowess of their Nimrod\r\nmonarchs, and the figures, in their minute anatomical characters, well\r\nagree with the descriptions and remains of the European _Urus_. The\r\nlarge forest that surrounded ancient London was infested with _boves\r\nsylvestres_ among other wild beasts, and it is probable that these were\r\n_Uri_. The legendary exploit of Guy, Earl of Warwick, in freeing the\r\nneighbourhood from a terrible dun cow, whether historically true or not,\r\nshews the existence of formidable wild bovines in the heart of England,\r\nand the terror they inspired among the people. The family of Turnbull,\r\nin Scotland, are traditionally said to owe their patronymic to a hero\r\nwho turned a wild bull from Robert the Bruce, when it had attacked him\r\nwhile hunting.\r\n\r\nWhat has become of the terrible Uri which lived in Europe at the\r\ncommencement of the Christian era? Advancing civilisation has rooted\r\nthem out, so that no living trace of them remains, unless the\r\ncream-white breed which is preserved in a semi-wild state in some of our\r\nnorthern parks be their representatives; or, as is not improbable, their\r\nblood may still circulate in our domestic oxen.\r\n\r\nYet there is no doubt of the identity of a species found abundantly in\r\nBritain in the Tertiary deposits, and named by Owen _Bos primigenius_,\r\nwith the Urus of Cæsar. This fossil bull was as certainly contemporary\r\nin this island with the elephant, and the hyena, and the baboon, and,\r\nstrange to say, with the reindeer, and the musk-ox, too--thus combining\r\na tropical, a temperate, and an arctic fauna in our limited island at\r\nthe same period! What a strange climate it must have been to suit them\r\nall!\r\n\r\nProfessor Nilsson, who has paid great attention to fossil oxen, mentions\r\na skull of this species which must have belonged to an animal more than\r\ntwelve feet in length from the nape to the root of the tail, and six\r\nfeet and a half in height. Again, the skull of a cow in the British\r\nMuseum, figured by Professor Owen, measures thirty inches from the crown\r\nto the tips of the jaws! What a beast must this have been! Would not the\r\nslaughter of such a \"Dun Cow\" as this in single combat have been an\r\nexploit worthy of a doughty earl?\r\n\r\nThat this ancient fossil bull was really contemporary with man in\r\nScandinavia is proved by evidence which is irrespective of the question\r\nof its identity with Cæsar's Urus. For one of Professor Nilsson's\r\nspecimens \"bears on its back a palpable mark of a wound from a javelin.\r\nSeveral celebrated anatomists and physiologists, among whom,\" he says,\r\n\"I need only mention the names of John Müller, of Berlin, and Andreas\r\nRetzius, of Stockholm, have inspected this skeleton, and are unanimous\r\nin the opinion that the hole in question upon the backbone is the\r\nconsequence of a wound, which, during the life of the animal, was made\r\nby the hand of man. The animal must have been very young, probably only\r\na calf, when it was wounded. The huntsman who cast the javelin must have\r\nstood before it. It was yet young when it died, probably not more than\r\nthree or four years old.\"\r\n\r\nWe may, then, assume as certain that the vast _Bos primigenius_ of\r\nWestern Europe lived as a wild animal contemporaneously with man; and as\r\nalmost certain (assuming its identity with the _Urus_) that it continued\r\nto be abundant as late as the Christian era.\r\n\r\nThe _Bos frontosus_ is a middling-sized bovine. \"Its remains,\" says\r\nProfessor Nilsson, \"are found in turf-bogs in Southern Scandinavia, and\r\nin such a state as plainly shews that they belonged to a more ancient\r\nperiod than that in which tame cattle existed in Sweden. This species\r\nlived in Scandinavia contemporaneously with the _Bos primigenius_, and\r\nthe _Bison Europæus_.... If ever it was tamed, and thereby in the course\r\nof time contributed to form some of the tame races of cattle, it must\r\nhave been the small-horned, often hornless, breed, which is to be found\r\nin the mountains of Norway, and which has a high protuberance between\r\nthe setting-on of the horns above the nape.\"\r\n\r\nThis species occurs in a fossil state in some numbers in Ireland; it has\r\nalso been found in England. It is by some supposed to be the origin of,\r\nor, at least, to have contributed blood to, the middling Highland races\r\nwith high occiput, and small horns.\r\n\r\nThere is more certainty of the co-existence of the small _B. longifrons_\r\nwith man. Some of the evidence I have already adduced. \"Within a few\r\nyears,\" says a trustworthy authority, \"we have read in one of the\r\nscientific periodicals,--but have just now sought in vain for the\r\nnotice,--of a quantity of bones that were dug up in some part of\r\nEngland, together with other remains of what seemed to be the relics of\r\na grand feast, held probably during the Roman domination of Britain,\r\nfor, if we mistake not, some Roman coins were found associated with\r\nthem. _There were skulls_ and other remains of _Bos longifrons_ quite\r\nundistinguishable in form from the antique fossil, whether wild or\r\ndomesticated, which, of course, remains a question.\"[55]\r\n\r\nProfessor Owen conjectures that this species may have contributed to\r\nform the present small shaggy Highland and Welsh cattle,--the kyloes and\r\nrunts; and a similar breed in the northern parts of Scania may have had\r\na similar origin.\r\n\r\nIn the _Bison priscus_, the fossil remains of which occur in many parts\r\nof Europe, and more sparsely in Great Britain,[56] we have an example of\r\na noble animal, which, contemporary with all those which have been\r\nengaging our attention, survives to the present hour, but is dying out,\r\nand would have long ago been extinguished, probably, but for the\r\nfostering influence of human conservation. For the species is considered\r\nas absolutely identical with the _Bison Europæus_ of modern zoology, the\r\nBison or Wisent of the Germans, the Aurochs of the Prussians, the Zubr\r\nof the Poles, that formidable creature, which is maintained by the Czar\r\nin an ever-diminishing herd in the vast forests of Lithuania,[57] and\r\nwhich, perhaps, still lingers in the fastnesses of the Caucasus. This,\r\nthe largest, or at least the most massive of all existing quadrupeds,\r\nafter the great Pachyderms, roamed over Germany in some numbers as late\r\nas the era of Charlemagne. Considerably later than this it is reckoned\r\namong the German beasts of chase, for in the _Niebelungen Lied_, a poem\r\nof the twelfth century, it is said,\r\n\r\n      \"Dar nach schlouch er schiere, einen wisent und einen elch,\r\n      Starcher ure viere, und einen grimmen schelch.\"\r\n\r\n      \"After this he straightway slew a bison and an elk,\r\n      Of the strong uri four, and a single fierce schelch.\"[58]\r\n\r\nIt is a formidable beast, standing six feet high at the shoulders, where\r\nit is protected by a thick and profuse mane. Specimens have been known\r\nto reach a ton in weight. It manifests an invincible repugnance to the\r\nox.\r\n\r\nThere are several other animals of note which, like the Bison, were once\r\ncommon inhabitants of these islands, but have long been extinct here,\r\nthough more genial circumstances have preserved their existence on the\r\ncontinent of Europe. Of the great Cave Bear, no evidence of its period\r\nexists, that I know of, except that which may be deduced from the\r\ncommixture of its remains with those of other animals of whose recent\r\ndate we have proof. But there is another kind of Bear, whose relics in a\r\nfossil state are not uncommon in the Tertiary deposits, viz., the common\r\nBlack Bear (_Ursus arctos_) of Europe.\r\n\r\nThis savage animal must have early succumbed to man. The \"Triads\"[59]\r\nmention bears as living here before the Kymri came. The Roman poets knew\r\nof their existence here: Martial speaks of the robber Laureolus being\r\nexposed on the cross to the fangs of the _Caledonian_ Bear; and Claudian\r\nalludes to British bears. The Emperor Claudius, on his return to Rome\r\nafter the conquest of this island, exhibited, as trophies, combats of\r\nBritish bears in the arena. In the Penitential of Archbishop Egbert,\r\nsaid to have been compiled about A.D. 750, bears are mentioned as\r\ninhabiting the English forests, but they must have gradually become\r\nrare, for the chase-laws of Canute, at the beginning of the eleventh\r\ncentury, are silent about them. In Doomsday Book, we find incidental\r\nnotice of this animal, for the city of Norwich is said to have been\r\nrequired to furnish a bear annually to Edward the Confessor, together\r\nwith \"six dogs for the bear,\"--no doubt for baiting him. This seems to\r\nhave been the latest trace on record of the bear in Britain; unless the\r\ntradition may compete with it, which states that one of the Gordon\r\nfamily was empowered by the king of Scotland to carry three bears' heads\r\non his banner, as a reward for his prowess in slaying a fierce bear.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland it seems to have become extinct even yet earlier. Bede\r\nsays the only ravenous animals in his day were the wolf and the fox;\r\nDonatus, who died in A.D. 840, distinctly says it was not a native\r\nof the island in his time; and Geraldus Cambrensis does not enumerate\r\nit as known in the twelfth century. Neither is it included in the\r\nransom-beasts of Cailte's collection. Yet a native Irish name for the\r\nbear--Mathghambain--occurs in an old glossary[60] in the Library of\r\nTrinity College, Dublin; and the late Wm. Thomson says that a tradition\r\nis current of its having once been an Irish animal; and it is associated\r\nwith the wolf as a native beast in the stories handed down from\r\ngeneration to generation to the present time.\r\n\r\nThe wolf, however, survived in both islands to a much later era. In the\r\ndays of the Heptarchy it was a terrible pest; King Edgar commuted the\r\npunishment of certain offences into a requisition for a fixed number of\r\nwolves' tongues; and he converted a heavy tax on one of the Welsh\r\nprinces into an annual tribute of three hundred wolves' heads. These\r\nlaws continued to the time of Edward I., when the increasing scarcity of\r\nthe animal doubtless caused them to fall into disuse. Mr Topham, in his\r\nNotes to Somerville's \"Chase,\" says, that it was in the wolds of\r\nYorkshire that a price was last set on a wolf's head. The last record of\r\ntheir occurring in formidable numbers in England is in 1281; but for\r\nthree centuries after this, the mountains and forests of Scotland\r\nharboured them; for Hollinshed reports that in 1577 the wolves were very\r\ntroublesome to the flocks of that country. Nor were they entirely\r\ndestroyed out of this island till about a century afterwards, when the\r\nlast wolf fell in Lochaber, by the hand of Sir Ewen Cameron of Lochiel.\r\nIn Ireland the last wolf was slain in 1710.\r\n\r\nThus here we are able to lay our finger on the exact dates when a large\r\nand rapacious species of animal actually became extinct so far as the\r\nBritish Isles are concerned. And if the species had been confined in its\r\ngeographical limits, as many other species of animals are, to one group\r\nof islands, we should know the precise date of its absolute extinction.\r\n\r\nThe Beaver was once an inhabitant of British rivers. Its remains are\r\nfound in Berkshire, Cambridgeshire, Yorkshire, and elsewhere, associated\r\nwith the other Mammalia of the fresh-water deposits and caves, but not\r\nin any abundance. No record of its actual existence, however, in these\r\ncounties exists, nor anywhere else but in Wales and Scotland, whose\r\nmountain streams and rugged ravines afforded it shelter till after the\r\nNorman Conquest. It was very rare even then, and for a hundred years\r\nbefore; for the laws of Howel Dda, the Welsh king, who died in 948, in\r\ndetermining the value of peltry, fix the price of the beaver's skin at a\r\nhundred and twenty pence, when the skins of the stag, the wolf, the fox,\r\nand the otter, were worth only eightpence each, that of the white weasel\r\nor ermine at twelvepence, and that of the marten, at twenty-four pence.\r\nThe appropriate epithet of Broad-tail (Llostllyddan) was given it by the\r\nWelsh. Giraldus Cambrensis, who travelled through Wales in 1188, gives,\r\nin his Itinerary, a short account of the beaver, but states that the\r\nriver Teivy in Cardiganshire, and one other river in Scotland, were the\r\nonly places in Great Britain, where it was then found. In all\r\nprobability it did not long survive that century, for no subsequent\r\nnotice of it as a British animal is extant. Tradition, however, still\r\npreserves the remembrance of its presence in those indelible records,\r\nnames of places. \"Two or three waters in the Principality,\" says\r\nPennant, \"still bear the name of _Llyn yr afangc_,--the Beaver Lake....\r\nI have seen two of their supposed haunts: one in the stream that runs\r\nthrough Nant Francon; the other in the river Conwy, a few miles above\r\nLlanrwst; and both places, in all probability, had formerly been crossed\r\nby beaver-dams.\"\r\n\r\nIf, as naturalists of the highest eminence believe, there is specific\r\ndifference between the beaver of Europe and that of America, then we may\r\nsay that our species is fast passing away from the earth. A few colonies\r\nyet linger along the banks of the Danube, the Weser, the Rhone and the\r\nEuphrates, but they consist of few individuals, ever growing fewer; and\r\nthe value of their fur exciting cupidity, they cannot probably resist\r\nmuch longer the exterminating violence of man.\r\n\r\nThe causes which led to the extinction of these animals in our islands\r\nare then obvious, and are thus playfully touched by the late James\r\nWilson:--\"The beaver might have carried on business well enough, in his\r\nown quiet way, although frequently incommoded by the love of peltry on\r\nthe part of a hat-wearing people; but it is clear that no man with a\r\nsmall family and a few respectable farm servants, could either permit a\r\nlarge and hungry wolf to be continually peeping at midnight through the\r\nkeyhole of the nursery, or allow a brawny bruin to snuff too frequently\r\nunder the kitchen door (after having hugged the watch-dog to death) when\r\nthe servant-maids were at supper. The extirpation then of at least two\r\nof these quondam British species became 'a work of necessity and mercy,'\r\nand might have been tolerated even on a Sunday, (between sermons,)\r\nespecially as naturalists have it still in their power to study the\r\nhabits of similar wild beasts, by no means yet extinct, in the\r\nneighbouring countries of France and Germany.\"[61]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the example of recent extinction most popularly known is that of\r\nthe Dodo, a very remarkable bird, which about two centuries ago existed\r\nin considerable abundance, in the isles of Mauritius, Bourbon, and\r\nRodriguez. It was a rather large fowl, incapable of rising from the\r\nground, by reason of the imperfect development of its wings, of massive,\r\nuncouth figure, predisposed to fatness, and noted for the sapidity of\r\nits flesh. Two skulls and two unmatched feet of this strange bird are\r\npreserved in European museums; and these shew that its nearest\r\naffinities were with the pigeon-tribe, of which we know some species of\r\nterrestrial habits, but none approaching this bird in its absolute\r\nconfinement to the earth.\r\n\r\nIn the reports of numerous voyagers who visited these islands from the\r\nend of the fifteenth century to the middle of the seventeenth, we have\r\nmany accounts of the appearance and habits of this bird, evidently\r\nsketched from the life. Some of the descriptions, as also the figures by\r\nwhich they are illustrated, are quaint enough; as, for example, that\r\ngraphic sketch hit off by old Sir Thomas Herbert, who saw the bird in\r\nhis travels in 1634:--\r\n\r\n     \"The Dodo,\" he says, \"comes first to our description. Here and in\r\n     Dygarrois (and nowhere else that I c^d ever see or heare of) is\r\n     generated the Dodo. (A Portuguize name it is, and has reference to\r\n     her simplenes) a bird which for shape and rareness might be call'd\r\n     a Ph{oe}nix (wer't in Arabia); her body is round and extreame fat,\r\n     her slow pace begets that corpulencie; few of them weigh lesse than\r\n     fifty pound: better to the eye than the stomack: greasie appetites\r\n     may perhaps commend them, but, to the indifferently curious,\r\n     nourishment, but prove offensive. Let's take her picture: her\r\n     visage darts forth melancholy, as sensible of nature's injurie in\r\n     framing so great and massive a body to be directed by such small\r\n     and complementall wings, as are unable to hoise her from the\r\n     ground, serving only to prove her a bird; which otherwise might be\r\n     doubted of: her head is variously drest, the one halfe hooded with\r\n     downy blackish feathers; the other perfectly naked; of a whitish\r\n     hue, as if a transparent lawne had covered it; her bill is very\r\n     howked and bends downwards, the thrill or breathing place is in the\r\n     midst of it; from which part to the end, the colour is a light\r\n     greene mixt with a pale yellow; her eyes be round and small, and\r\n     bright as diamonds; her cloathing is of finest downe, such as ye\r\n     see in goslins; her trayne is (like a China beard) of three or\r\n     foure short feythers; her legs thick, and black, and strong; her\r\n     tallons or pounces sharp; her stomack fiery hot, so as stones and\r\n     yron are easilie digested in it; in that and shape, not a little\r\n     resembling the Africk oestriches: but so much, as for their more\r\n     certain dyfference I dare to give thee (with two others) her\r\n     representation.\"[62]\r\n\r\nIt is pretty certain that a living specimen was about the same time\r\nexhibited in England. Sir Hamon L'Estrange tells us distinctly that he\r\n_saw_ it. His original MS. is preserved in the British Museum, and with\r\nsome blanks caused by the injury of time, of no great consequence, reads\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"About 1638, as I walked London streets, I saw the picture\r\n             of a strange fowl hong out upon a cloth.\r\n             vas and myselfe with one or two more Gen. in\r\n     company went in to see it. It was kept in a chamber, and was a\r\n     greate fowle somewhat bigger than the largest Turky Cock and so\r\n     legged and footed but stouter and thicker and of a more erect\r\n     shape, coloured before like the breast of a yong Cock Fesan and on\r\n     the back of dunn or deare coulour. The keeper called it a Dodo and\r\n     in the ende of a chimney in the chamber there lay an heap of large\r\n     pebble stones whereof hee gave it many in our sight, some as bigg\r\n     as nutmegs and the keeper told us shee eats them conducing to\r\n     digestion and though I remember not how farre the keeper was\r\n     questioned therein yet I am confident that afterwards shee cast\r\n     them all agayne.\"[63]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that this very specimen passed into the museum of\r\nTradescant, who, in the Catalogue of \"The Collection of Rarities\r\npreserved at Lambeth,\" dated 1656, mentions the following: \"Dodar from\r\nthe Island Mauritius: it is not able to flie being so bigg.\" Willoughby\r\nthe ornithologist, a most unexceptionable testimony, says that he saw\r\nthis specimen in Tradescant's museum: it is mentioned also by\r\nothers;--as by Llhwyd in 1684, and by Hyde in 1700. It passed, with the\r\nrest of the Tradescant Collection, to Oxford, and thus became part of\r\nthe Ashmolean Museum,--and being in a decayed condition, was ordered to\r\nbe destroyed by the authorities, who had no apprehension of its value,\r\nin 1755. The skull and one foot, however, were preserved, and are still\r\nin the Museum at Oxford. Remains of the Dodo have been dug up in the\r\nMauritius, and are in the Paris Museum, and in that of the Zoological\r\nSociety of London. The bird certainly does not exist there now, nor in\r\neither of the neighbouring islands.\r\n\r\nIn the British Museum there is a fine original painting, once the\r\nproperty of George Edwards, the celebrated bird painter, representing\r\nthe Dodo surrounded by other minor birds and reptiles. Edwards states\r\nthat \"it was drawn in Holland, from a living bird brought from St\r\nMaurice's Island, in the East Indies. It was the property of Sir Hans\r\nSloane at the time of his death, and afterwards becoming my property, I\r\ndeposited it in the British Museum as a great curiosity.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Owen has discovered another original figure of this\r\ninteresting form in Savary's painting of \"Orpheus and the Beasts,\" at\r\nthe Hague. The figure, though small, displays all the characteristic\r\npeculiarities, and agrees well with Edwards' painting, while evincing\r\nthat it was copied from the living bird.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that there were two species of Dodo; which would explain\r\ncertain discrepancies in the descriptions of observers. At all events we\r\nhave here one, if not more, conspicuous animal absolutely extinguished\r\nwithin the last two hundred years.\r\n\r\nJust about a century ago a great animal disappeared from the ocean,\r\nwhich, according to Owen, was contemporary with the fossil elephant and\r\nrhinoceros of Siberia and England. Steller, a Russian voyager and\r\nnaturalist, discovered the creature, afterward called _Stelleria_ by\r\nCuvier, in Behring's Straits; a huge, unwieldy whale-like animal, one of\r\nthe marine pachyderms, allied to the Manatee, but much larger, being\r\ntwenty-five feet long, and twenty in circumference. Its flesh was good\r\nfor food, and from its inertness and incapacity for defence, the race\r\nwas extirpated in a few years. Steller first discovered the species in\r\n1741, and the last known specimen was killed in 1768. It is believed to\r\nbe quite extinct, as it has never been met with since.\r\n\r\nNearly a century ago, Sonnerat found in Madagascar, a curious animal,\r\n(_Cheiromys_,) which in structure seems to connect the monkeys with the\r\nsquirrels. So rare was it there that even the natives viewed it with\r\ncuriosity as an animal altogether unknown to them; and, from their\r\nexclamations of astonishment rather than from its cry, the French\r\nnaturalist is said to have conferred upon it the name of Aye-aye, by\r\nwhich it is now known. _Not a specimen, as I believe, has been seen\r\nsince Sonnerat's day_, so that, if not actually obliterated, the species\r\nmust be on the verge of extinction.\r\n\r\nSpecies are dying out in our own day. I have already cited the\r\ninteresting case of the Moho, that fine Gallinule of New Zealand, of\r\nwhich a specimen--probably the last of its race,--was obtained by Mr\r\nWalter Mantell; and that of the Káureke, the badger-like quadruped of\r\nthe same islands, which was formerly domesticated by the Maoris, but\r\nwhich now cannot be found.\r\n\r\nThe Samoa Isles in the Pacific recently possessed a large and handsome\r\nkind of pigeon, of richly-coloured plumage, which the natives called\r\n_Manu-mea_, but to which modern naturalists have given the name of\r\n_Didunculus strigirostris_. It was, both by structure and habit,\r\nessentially a ground pigeon, but not so exclusively but that it fed, and\r\nroosted too, according to Lieut. Walpole, among the branches of tall\r\ntrees. Mr T. Peale, the naturalist of the U. S. Exploring Expedition,\r\nwho first described it, informs us that according to the tradition of\r\nthe natives, it once abounded; but some years ago these persons, like\r\nmore civilised folks, had a strong desire to make pets of cats, and\r\nfound, by means of whale-ships, opportunities of procuring a supply; but\r\nthe consequence of the introduction of \"pussy,\"--for under this familiar\r\nold-country title were the exotic tabbies introduced--was the rapid\r\ndiminution of the handsome _Manu-mea_. Pussy did not fancy yams and\r\ntaro--the vegetable diet on which the natives regaled--and took to the\r\nwoods and mountains to search for something better. There she met with\r\nthe feeble-winged _Didunculus_ scratching the soft earth for seeds, and\r\nwith a purr and a mew soon scraped acquaintance with the stranger. Pussy\r\ndeclared she loved him well, and so she did--too well, in fact; she felt\r\n\"as if she could eat him up,\"--_and did_. The news soon spread among the\r\ntabbies that there were sweet birds in the woods, and the result is the\r\nalmost total disappearance of poor _Manu-mea_. Like the Dodo, it has\r\nceased to be, but at the hand of a more ignominious foe. The Samoan may\r\ntruly say to his former pet, \"_Cecidisti, O Manu-mea, non manu meâ, sed\r\nungue felino_.\" So rare had the bird become, that during the stay of the\r\nExpedition only three specimens could be procured, and of these two were\r\nlost by shipwreck. I do not know whether another has been met with\r\nsince. Probably they are all gone; for that was twenty years ago.\r\n\r\nWhen Norfolk Island,--that tiny spot in the Southern Ocean since so\r\nstained with human crime and misery--was first discovered, its tall and\r\nteeming forests were tenanted by a remarkable Parrot with a very long\r\nand slender hooked beak, which lived upon the honey of flowers. It was\r\nnamed _Nestor productus_. When Mr Gould visited Australia in his\r\nresearches into the ornithology of those antipodeal regions, he found\r\nthe Nestor Parrot absolutely limited to Philip Island, a tiny satellite\r\nof Norfolk Island, whose whole circumference is not more than five\r\nmiles in extent. The war of extermination had been so successful in the\r\nlarger island that, with the exception of a few specimens preserved in\r\ncages, not one was believed to survive. Since then its last retreat has\r\nbeen harried, and Mr J. H. Gurney thus writes the dirge of the last of\r\nthe Nestors:--\r\n\r\n\"I have seen the man who exterminated the _Nestor productus_ from Philip\r\nIsland, he having shot the last of that species left on the island; he\r\ninforms me that they rarely made use of their wings, except when closely\r\npressed; their mode of progression was by the upper mandible; and\r\nwhenever he used to go to the island to shoot, he would invariably find\r\nthem on the ground, except one, which used to be sentry on one of the\r\nlower branches of the _Araucaria excelsa_, and the instant any person\r\nlanded, they would run to those trees and haul themselves up by the\r\nbill, and, as a matter of course, they would there remain till they were\r\nshot, or the intruder had left the island. He likewise informed me that\r\nthere was a large species of hawk that used to commit great havoc\r\namongst them, but what species it was he could not tell me.\"[64]\r\n\r\nI have before mentioned that Professor Owen had recognised the species\r\nin fossil skulls from New Zealand, associated with remains of\r\n_Dinornis_, _Palapteryx_, and _Notornis_. Thus it appears that the\r\nlong-billed Parrot is an ancient race, whose extreme decrepitude has\r\njust survived to our time;--that it first became extinct from New\r\nZealand, then from Norfolk Island, and lastly from Philip Island. Peace\r\nto its ashes!\r\n\r\nMr Yarrell, in his \"History of British Birds,\"[65] commences his account\r\nof one of them in these words:--\"The Great Auk is a very rare British\r\nBird, and but few instances are recorded of its capture. The natives in\r\nthe Orkneys informed Mr Bullock, on his tour through these islands\r\nseveral years ago, that only one male had made its appearance for a long\r\ntime, which had regularly visited Papa Westra for several seasons. The\r\nfemale, which the natives call the queen of the Auks, was killed just\r\nbefore Mr Bullock's arrival. The king or male, Mr Bullock had the\r\npleasure of chasing for several hours in a six-oared boat, but without\r\nbeing able to kill him, for though he frequently got near him, so expert\r\nwas the bird in its natural element that it appeared impossible to shoot\r\nhim. The rapidity with which he pursued his course under water was\r\nalmost incredible. About a fortnight after Mr Bullock had left Papa\r\nWestra, this male bird was obtained and sent him, and at the sale of his\r\ncollection, was purchased for the British Museum, where it is still\r\ncarefully preserved.\"\r\n\r\nThis fine bird, which was larger than a goose, is believed to be\r\nextinct. Mr Bullock's specimen was taken in 1812; another was captured\r\nat St Kilda in 1822, another was picked up dead near Lundy Island in\r\n1829, and yet another was taken in 1834, off the coast of Waterford.\r\n\r\nOn the north coast of Europe the bird is equally rare; not more than\r\ntwo or three, at the utmost, having been procured during the present\r\ncentury. During that period, however, it has haunted one or two\r\nbreeding-rocks on the south coast of Iceland, in some abundance. In the\r\nyears 1830 and 1831, as many as twenty-seven were obtained there, and\r\nfrom that time till 1840, about ten more. The last birds obtained on the\r\nIceland coast were a pair, which were shot on their nest in 1844. The\r\nlast taken in any locality, so far as is known, was one shot in 1848, by\r\na peasant, on the Island of Wardoe, within the Arctic Circle.\r\n\r\nTwo centuries ago, the Great Auk was not uncommon on the shores of New\r\nEngland; and, off the great fishing-banks of Newfoundland, it appears to\r\nhave been very abundant. \"Its appearance was always hailed by the\r\nmariner approaching that desolate coast as the first indication of his\r\nhaving reached soundings on the fishing-banks. During the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries these waters, as well as the Iceland and Faroe\r\ncoasts, were annually visited by hundreds of ships from England, France,\r\nSpain, Holland, and Portugal; and these ships actually were accustomed\r\nto provision themselves with the bodies and eggs of these birds, which\r\nthey found breeding in myriads on the low islands off the coast of\r\nNewfoundland. Besides the fresh birds consumed by the ship's crew, many\r\ntons were salted down for further use. In the space of an hour, these\r\nold voyagers tell us, they could fill thirty boats with the birds. It\r\nwas only necessary to go on shore, armed with sticks to kill as many as\r\nthey chose. The birds were so stupid that they allowed themselves to be\r\ntaken up, on their own proper element, by boats under sail; and it is\r\neven said that on putting out a plank it was possible to drive the Great\r\nAuks up and out of the sea into boats. On land the sailors formed low\r\nenclosures of stones, into which they drove the Penguins [or Auks], and,\r\nas they were unable to fly, kept them there enclosed till they were\r\nwanted for the table.\"\r\n\r\n\"In 1841, a distinguished Norwegian naturalist, (too early, alas! lost\r\nto science,) Peter Stuwitz, visited Tunk Island, or Penguin Island,\r\nlying to the east of Newfoundland. Here, on the north-west shore of the\r\nisland, he found enormous heaps of bones and skeletons of the Great Auk,\r\nlying either in exposed masses or slightly covered by the earth. On this\r\nside of the island the rocks slope gradually down to the shore; and here\r\nwere still standing the stone fences and enclosures into which the birds\r\nwere driven for slaughter.\"[66]\r\n\r\nIt is just possible that the bird may yet haunt the inaccessible coast\r\nof East Greenland, but ships sailing between that country and Iceland\r\nnever meet with it at sea. Nor did Graah observe it during his toilsome\r\nresearches east of Cape Farewell. The numerous fishing craft that every\r\nseason crowd the shores of Newfoundland and Labrador forbid the notion\r\nthat it yet lingers there; for the great market-value set upon the bird\r\nand its eggs for collections would prevent its existence there from\r\nbeing overlooked. The numerous Polar voyages of discovery, and the\r\nannual fleets of whalers, would certainly have discovered it, if it\r\nstill haunted the more northern regions. It is possible that a few\r\nisolated individuals may still survive; but it is the habit of the bird,\r\nas of most sea-fowl, to breed in society in bare seaward rocks, and the\r\ncircumstance that no breeding station is known to be now frequented by\r\nthe Great Auk renders it but too probable that it also must be classed\r\namong the species that were.\r\n\r\nThe interest attached to this now extinct bird has induced some\r\ncorrespondents of the _Zoologist_ to attempt an enumeration of the\r\nspecimens, both of the bird and of its eggs, (which from their great\r\nsize, as well as from their rarity, have always had a value with\r\ncollectors,) known to be preserved in cabinets. The result is that\r\nEnglish collections contain 14 birds and 23 eggs; those of continental\r\nEurope, 11 birds and 20 eggs; the United States, 1 bird and 2 eggs:--the\r\ntotal being 26 birds and 45 eggs.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that the rock off the south of Iceland which was the\r\nchief breeding resort of the Great Auk, and which from that circumstance\r\nbore the name or \"Geir-fulga Sker,\" sank to the level of the sea during\r\na volcanic disturbance in or about the year 1830. \"Such disappearance of\r\nthe fit and favourable breeding-places of the _Alca impennis_,\" observes\r\nProfessor Owen, \"must form an important element in its decline towards\r\nextinction.\" One might think that there would be rocks enough left for\r\nthe birds to choose a fresh station; but really we do not know what are\r\nthe elements of choice in such a case: some peculiarities exist which\r\nmake one particular rock to be selected by sea-fowl, when others\r\napparently to us as suitable are quite neglected; but we do not know\r\nwhat they are. Possibly when Geir-fulga Sker sank, there was no other\r\nislet fit to supply the blank. Possibly, too, the submersion took place\r\nduring the breeding season, drowning the eggs or young. If this was the\r\ncase, it would indeed be \"a heavy blow and great discouragement\" to the\r\ndwindling Alcine nation.\r\n\r\nMr Darwin speaks of a large wolf-like Fox (_Canis antarcticus_) which at\r\nthe time of his voyage was common to both the Falkland Islands, but\r\nabsolutely confined to them. He says, \"As far as I am aware, there is no\r\nother instance in any part of the world, of so small a mass of broken\r\nland, distant from a continent, possessing so large an aboriginal\r\nquadruped peculiar to itself. Their numbers have rapidly decreased; they\r\nare already banished from that half of the island which lies to the\r\neastward of the neck of land between St Salvador Bay and Berkeley Sound.\r\nWithin a very few years after these islands shall have become regularly\r\nsettled, in all probability this fox will be classed with the Dodo, as\r\nan animal which has perished from the face of the earth.\"[67]\r\n\r\nThe Musk Ox (_Ovibos moschatus_), a long-haired ruminant, resembling\r\nwhat you would suppose a cross between a bull and a sheep might\r\nbe,--formerly an inhabitant of Britain with the Elephant and the Hyena,\r\nbut now found only on the polar margins of North America,--is becoming\r\nvery scarce; and it is probable that before long its last representative\r\nwill leave its bones with those of the lamented Franklin and his\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nFrom the more perishable character of vegetable tissues we have far less\r\ndata for determining the extinction of plant species; but analogy\r\nrenders it highly probable that these also have died out, and are dying\r\nin a corresponding ratio with animals. I am not aware that a single\r\nexample can be adduced of a plant that has certainly ceased to exist\r\nduring the historic era. But Humboldt mentions a very remarkable tree in\r\nMexico, of which it is believed only a single specimen remains in a\r\nstate of nature. It is the Hand-tree (_Cheirostemon platanoides_), a\r\nsterculaceous plant with large plane-like leaves, and with the anthers\r\nconnected together in such a manner as to resemble a hand or claw rising\r\nfrom the beautiful purplish-red blossoms. \"There is in all the Mexican\r\nfree States only one individual remaining, one single primeval stem of\r\nthis wonderful genus. It is supposed not to be indigenous, but to have\r\nbeen planted by a king of Toluca about five hundred years ago. I found\r\nthat the spot where the Arbol de las Manitas stands is 8825 feet above\r\nthe level of the sea. Why is there only one tree of the kind? Whence did\r\nthe kings of Toluca obtain the young tree, or the seed? It is equally\r\nenigmatical that Montezuma should not have possessed one of these trees\r\nin his botanical gardens of Huaxtepec, Chapoltepec, and Iztapalapan,\r\nwhich were used as late as by Philip the Second's physician, Hernandez,\r\nand of which gardens traces still remain; and it appears no less\r\nstriking that the Hand-tree should not have found a place among the\r\ndrawings of subjects connected with Natural History, which Nezahual\r\nCoyotl, king of Tezcuco, caused to be made half a century before the\r\narrival of the Spaniards.\"\r\n\r\nThere is an example of this interesting plant growing in one of the\r\nconservatories at Kew, but I do not know whence it was obtained. It has\r\nbeen asserted that it grows wild in the forests of Guatemala.\r\n\r\nLeaving plants out of consideration from lack of adequate data, we find\r\nthat a considerable number of species of animals have certainly ceased\r\nto exist since man inhabited the globe. There have been, doubtless, many\r\nothers that have shared the same fate, which we know nothing about. It\r\nis only within the last hundred years that we have had anything\r\napproaching to an acquaintance with the living fauna of the earth; yet,\r\nduring that time some seven or eight creatures we know have been\r\nextinguished. Fully half of these,--the Auk, the Didunculus, the\r\nNotornis, and the Nestor,--within the last ten years! It would really\r\nseem as if the more complete and comprehensive an acquaintance with the\r\nanimals of the world became, the more frequently this strange phenomenon\r\nof expiring species was presented to us. Perhaps it is not extravagant\r\nto suppose that--including all the invertebrate animals, the countless\r\nhosts of insects, and all the recondite forms that dwell in the recesses\r\nof the ocean--a species fades from existence every year. All the\r\nexamples that have been given were either Mammalia or Birds, (_the\r\nColossochelys_ only excepted:) now these, though the most conspicuous\r\nand best known, are almost the least populous classes of living beings.\r\nThere is no reason whatever for concluding that the law of mortality of\r\nspecies does not extend to all the other classes, vertebrate and\r\ninvertebrate, in an equal ratio, so that my estimate will appear, I\r\nthink, a very moderate one. Yet it is a startling thought, and one which\r\nthe mind does not entertain without a measure of revulsion, that the\r\npassing of every century in the world's history has left its fauna\r\n_minus_ a hundred species of animals that were denizens of the earth\r\nwhen it began. I was going to say \"left the fauna so much _poorer_;\" but\r\nthat I am not sure of. The term would imply that the blanks are not\r\nfilled up; and that, I repeat, I am not sure of. Probability would\r\nsuggest that new forms are continually created to supply the lack of\r\ndeceased ones; and it may be that _some_, at least, of the creatures\r\never and anon described as new to science, especially in old and\r\nwell-searched regions, may be newly called into being, as well as newly\r\ndiscovered. It may be so, I say; I have no evidence that it is so,\r\nexcept the probability of analogy; we know that the rate of mortality\r\namong _individuals_ of a species, speaking generally, is equalled by the\r\nrate of birth, and we may suppose this balance of life to be paralleled\r\nwhen the unit is a species, and not an individual. If the Word of God\r\ncontained anything either in statement or principle contrary to such a\r\nsupposition, I would not entertain it for a moment, but I do not know\r\nthat it does. I do not know that it is anywhere implied that God created\r\nno more after the six days' work was done. His Sabbath-rest having been\r\nbroken by the incoming of sin, we know from John v. 17, that He\r\ncontinued to work without interruption; and we may fairly conclude that\r\nprogressive creation was included as a part of that unceasing work.\r\n\r\nI know not whether my readers will take the same concern as I do in this\r\nsubject of the dying-out of species, but to me it possesses a very\r\npeculiar interest. Death is a mysterious event, come when and how it\r\nwill; and surely the departure from existence of a species, of a type of\r\nbeing, that has subsisted in contemporary thousands of individuals, for\r\nthousands of years, is not less imposingly mysterious than that of the\r\nindividual exemplar.\r\n\r\nWe do not know with any precision what are the immediate causes of death\r\nin a species. Is there a definite limit to life imposed at first? or is\r\nthis limit left, so to speak, to be determined by accidental\r\ncircumstances? Perhaps both: but if the latter, what are those\r\ncircumstances?\r\n\r\nProfessor Owen says:--\"There are characters in land animals rendering\r\nthem more obnoxious to extirpating influences, which may explain why so\r\nmany of the larger species of particular groups have become extinct,\r\nwhilst smaller species of equal antiquity have survived. In proportion\r\nto its bulk is the difficulty of the contest which the animal has to\r\nmaintain against the surrounding agencies that are ever tending to\r\ndissolve the vital bond, and subjugate the living matter to the\r\nordinary chemical and physical forces. Any changes, therefore, in such\r\nexternal agencies as a species may have been originally adapted to exist\r\nin, will militate against that existence in a degree proportionate to\r\nthe size which may characterise the species. If a dry season be\r\ngradually prolonged, the large mammal will suffer from the drought\r\nsooner than the small one; if such alteration of climate affect the\r\nquantity of vegetable food, the bulky herbivore will first feel the\r\neffects of stinted nourishment; if new enemies be introduced, the large\r\nand conspicuous animal will fall a prey while the smaller kinds conceal\r\nthemselves and escape. Small quadrupeds, moreover, are more prolific\r\nthan large ones. Those of the bulk of the mastodons, megatheria,\r\nglyptodons, and diprotodons, are uniparous. The actual presence,\r\ntherefore, of small species of animals in countries where larger species\r\nof the same natural families formerly existed, is not the consequence of\r\ndegeneration--of any gradual diminution of the size--of such species,\r\nbut is the result of circumstances which may be illustrated by the fable\r\nof 'the Oak and the Reed;' the smaller and feebler animals have bent and\r\naccommodated themselves to changes to which the larger species have\r\nsuccumbed.\"[68]\r\n\r\n\"We do not steadily bear in mind,\" remarks Mr Darwin, \"how profoundly\r\nignorant we are of the condition of existence of every animal; nor do we\r\nalways remember that some check is constantly preventing the too rapid\r\nincrease of every organised being left in a state of nature. The supply\r\nof food, on an average, remains constant; yet the tendency in every\r\nanimal to increase by propagation is geometrical; and its surprising\r\neffects have nowhere been more astonishingly shewn, than in the case of\r\nthe European animals run wild during the last few centuries in America.\r\nEvery animal in a state of nature regularly breeds; yet in a species\r\nlong established, any _great_ increase in numbers is obviously\r\nimpossible, and must be checked by some means. We are nevertheless\r\nseldom able with certainty to tell in any given species, at what period\r\nof life, or at what period of the year, or whether only at long\r\nintervals, the check falls; or again, what is the precise nature of the\r\ncheck. Hence probably it is, that we feel so little surprise at one, of\r\ntwo species closely allied in habits, being rare and the other abundant\r\nin the same district; or again, that one should be abundant in one\r\ndistrict, and another, filling the same place in the economy of nature,\r\nshould be abundant in a neighbouring district, differing very little in\r\nits conditions. If asked how this is, one immediately replies that it is\r\ndetermined by some slight difference in climate, food, or the number of\r\nenemies: yet how rarely, if ever, we can point out the precise cause and\r\nmanner of action of the check! We are, therefore, driven to the\r\nconclusion that causes generally quite inappreciable by us, determine\r\nwhether a given species shall be abundant or scanty in numbers.\r\n\r\n\"In the cases where we can trace the extinction of a species through\r\nman, either wholly or in one limited district, we know that it becomes\r\nrarer and rarer, and is then lost; it would be difficult to point out\r\nany just distinction between a species destroyed by man or by the\r\nincrease of its natural enemies. The evidence of rarity preceding\r\nextinction, is more striking in the successive tertiary strata, as\r\nremarked by several able observers; it has often been found that a shell\r\nvery common in a tertiary stratum is now most rare, and has even long\r\nbeen thought to be extinct. If, then, as appears probable, species first\r\nbecome rare and then extinct--if the too rapid increase of every\r\nspecies, even the most favoured, is steadily checked, as we must admit,\r\nthough how and when it is hard to say--and if we see, without the\r\nsmallest surprise, though unable to assign the precise reason, one\r\nspecies abundant, and another closely-allied species rare in the same\r\ndistrict--why should we feel such great astonishment at the rarity being\r\ncarried a step further to extinction? An action going on, on every side\r\nof us, and yet barely appreciable, might surely be carried a little\r\nfurther, without exciting our observation. Who could feel any great\r\nsurprise at hearing that the Megalonyx was formerly rare compared with\r\nthe Megatherium, or that one of the fossil Monkeys was few in number\r\ncompared with one of the now living Monkeys? and yet, in this\r\ncomparative rarity, we should have the plainest evidence of less\r\nfavourable conditions for their existence. To admit that species\r\ngenerally become rare before they become extinct--to feel no surprise at\r\nthe comparative rarity of one species with another, and yet to call in\r\nsome extraordinary agent and to marvel greatly when a species ceases to\r\nexist, appears to me much the same as to admit that sickness in the\r\nindividual is the prelude of death--to feel no surprise at sickness--but\r\nwhen the sick man dies to wonder, and to believe that he died through\r\nviolence.\"[69]\r\n\r\nGeographical distribution is an important element in this question of\r\nextinction. A species that is spread over a wide region is far more\r\nlikely to survive than one which is confined to a limited district; and\r\nextraneous influences acting prejudicially will exterminate a species\r\nwhich is confined to an island much sooner than if it had a continent to\r\nretire upon. We have seen how the _Nestor_ Parrot became extinct in New\r\nZealand, while it survived in Norfolk Island, because the former was\r\ncolonised by the Maori race, while the latter remained in its virginity.\r\nBut how quickly did the poor Parrot succumb as soon as man set his foot\r\non Norfolk and Philip Islands! And how brief was the lease of life\r\naccorded to the _Didunculus_, when once the \"Pussies\" found their way to\r\nthe little Samoa isles!\r\n\r\nVery many islands have a fauna that is to a great extent peculiar to\r\nthemselves. I know that, in Jamaica, the Humming-birds, some of the\r\nParrots, some of the Cuckoos, most of the Pigeons, many of the smaller\r\nbirds, and, I think, all of the Reptiles, are found nowhere else. Nay,\r\nmore, that even the smaller islands of the Antilles have each a fauna of\r\nits own, unshared with any other land;--its own Humming-birds, its own\r\nLizards and Snakes; its own Butterflies and Beetles, its own Spiders,\r\nits own Snails, its own Worms. How likely are some of these very limited\r\nspecies to become extinguished! By the increasing aggressions of\r\nclearing and cultivating man; by slight changes of level; even by\r\nelectric and meteoric phenomena acting very locally. I find that, in\r\nJamaica, many of the animals peculiar to the island are not spread over\r\nthe whole surface, limited as that is, but are confined to a single\r\nsmall district. In some cases, the individuals are but few, even in that\r\nfavoured locality; how easily we may conceive of a season drier than\r\nordinary, or wetter than ordinary, or a flood, or a hurricane of unusual\r\nviolence, or a volcanic eruption, either killing outright these few\r\nindividuals, or destroying their means of living, and so indirectly\r\ndestroying them by starvation. And then the species has disappeared!\r\n\r\nThe common Red Grouse, so abundantly seen during the season hanging at\r\nevery poulterer's and game-dealer's shop in London, is absolutely\r\nunknown out of the British Isles. It could not live except in wide,\r\nunenclosed, uncultivated districts; so that when the period arrives that\r\nthe whole of British land is enclosed and brought under cultivation, the\r\nGrouse's lease of life will expire. We owe it to our hard-worked members\r\nof Parliament to hope that this condition of things may be distant.\r\n\r\n[1] See my _Omphalos_,--_passim_.\r\n\r\n[2] The gradual but constant elevation of the bed of the Baltic, and the\r\nsubsidence of that of the Pacific Ocean, are examples on a large scale.\r\n\r\n[3] Gen. x. 5.\r\n\r\n[4] _Chlamydotherium_, _Euryodon_, _Glossotherium_, _&c._\r\n\r\n[5] Owen _On the Mylodon_.\r\n\r\n[6] Perhaps the most complete and the most magnificent skeleton of this\r\nanimal ever discovered, was exhumed in 1849 at Killowen, in Co.

The farmer complained to Cailte that although he sowed\r\na great quantity of corn every year, it yielded him no profit, on\r\naccount of _a huge wild Deer_ which every year came across the Slaney\r\nfrom the west when the corn was ripe for cutting, and, rushing through\r\nit in all directions, trampled it down under his feet. Cailte undertook\r\nto relieve him, and he sent into Munster for his seven deer-nets, which\r\narrived in due time. He then went out and placed his men and his hounds\r\nin the paths through which the great deer was accustomed to pass, and he\r\nset his deer-nets upon the cliffs, passes, and rivers around, and when\r\nhe saw the animal coming to the Ford of the Red Deer on the river\r\nSlaney, he took his spear and cast a fortunate throw at him, driving it\r\nthe length of a man's arm out through the opposite side; and 'The Red\r\nFord of the Great Deer' is the name of that pass on the Slaney ever\r\nsince; and they brought him back to Drom Lethan, or 'The Broad Hill,'\r\nwhich is called 'The Broad Hill of the Great Wild Deer.'\"\r\n\r\n[55] The Editor of \"The Indian Field;\" in the _Zoologist_, p. 6427.\r\n\r\n[56] The Welsh \"Triads,\" supposed to have been compiled in the seventh\r\ncentury, say that \"the Kymri, a Celtic tribe, first inhabited Britain;\r\nbefore them were no men here, but only bears, wolves, beavers, and oxen\r\nwith high prominences.\" Were these Bisons?\r\n\r\n[57] See Vol. i, 203, _supra_.\r\n\r\n[58] This is the more interesting because it includes the _Urus_ as well\r\nas the \"_Schelch_,\" which latter, though the meaning of the word is not\r\ncertain, some are disposed to identify with the Giant Deer of Ireland.\r\n\r\n[59] See note [56] on p. 68.\r\n\r\n[60] M.S.

The poetical\r\nperiod of history in every country is full of prodigies; for in the dawn\r\nof civilisation the physical laws of nature are little understood, and\r\nmultitudes of natural phenomena are either referred to false causes, or,\r\nbeing unreferrible to any recognised cause, are set down as mere\r\nwonders. It is the province of science to dispel these delusions, to\r\nexpose the undiscovered, but by no means undiscoverable, origins of\r\nunusual events, and thus to be continually narrowing the limits of the\r\nunknown. These limits, however, have not even yet quite reached the\r\nminuteness of a mathematical point; and there are a few marvels left for\r\nthe indefatigable rummagings of modern science to explain.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the predominant tendency of uneducated minds in the present day\r\nis rather to attribute effects to _false_ causes, than to leave them\r\nwithout any assignable cause. It is much easier for an unreasoning\r\nperson to say that Tenterden steeple is the cause of Goodwin Sands, than\r\nto leave Goodwin Sands quite unaccounted for; or to say, the plant-lice\r\nsuddenly appear crowding the rose-twigs, \"the east wind has cast a\r\nblight,\" or \"it is something in the air,\" than \"I do not know how to\r\naccount for their appearance.\" To a reflecting person, indeed, who\r\nweighs forces, the east wind appears as incompetent to the production of\r\nliving animals as the tall tower to the origination of a sand-bank; and\r\nthis, though he might be able to suggest nothing a whit more competent.\r\nWhat should he do in such a case? Manifestly this--test the actual\r\nexistence and conditions of the phenomenon; see that it really has\r\noccurred; and, if the fact cannot be denied, admit it as a fact, and\r\nwait further light as to its causation.\r\n\r\nI do not by any means presume to declare the universal \"why and because\"\r\nof every familiar or unfamiliar occurrence: I leave that to more\r\npretentious philosophers; smiling occasionally in my sleeve at the\r\negotism which cannot see its own _non-sequiturs_. But still less can I\r\nconsent to set aside every phenomenon which I cannot explain, with the\r\ncommon resource,--\"Pooh! pooh! there must be some mistake!\" Rather would\r\nI say, \"There must still be some ignorance in me: near as I have reached\r\nto the summit of the ladder of knowledge, there must be still one or two\r\nrongs to be mounted before I can proclaim my mastery of all, absolutely\r\n_all_, the occult causes of things. Therefore, till then I must be\r\ncontent with the lowlier task of patiently accumulating evidence.\"\r\n\r\nAt various times and in various places popular superstition has been\r\nexcited by the occurrence of what have been called showers of blood. The\r\ndestruction of cities and of kingdoms has been, according to historians,\r\npreceded by this awful omen. Yet this has been explained by a very\r\nnatural and accountable phenomenon. In the year 1553, the hedges and\r\ntrees, the stones of the pathway, and the clothes of many persons, were\r\nsprinkled copiously with drops of red fluid, which was supposed to be\r\nblood, till some observant person noticed the coincident appearance of\r\nunusual swarms of butterflies, and marked that the coloured drops\r\nproceeded from them. Again, at Aix la Chapelle in 1608, the same awful\r\nappearance occurred, especially on the walls of a particular churchyard.\r\nM. Peiresc, an able naturalist, residing at Aix, traced the phenomenon\r\nhere to the same cause. Just before, he had found a large chrysalis,\r\nwhich he had enclosed in a box, in order to identify the species to\r\nwhich it belonged. A few days after, hearing a rustling, he opened the\r\nbox, and discovered a beautiful butterfly evolved from the pupa, which\r\nhad left upon the floor of its prison a large red stain. He saw that the\r\ncharacter of this deposit agreed exactly with that of the ominous drops\r\nabroad, and remarking an unusual abundance of the same kind of\r\nbutterfly, he conceived that he had revealed the cause of the terrific\r\nphenomenon. He was confirmed in this belief by the circumstance that the\r\nsupposed blood-drops were not found in the streets of the town, nor upon\r\nthe roofs of the houses, where they must have occurred had they fallen\r\nfrom the sky; and, moreover, that it was rare to see any on the exposed\r\nparts of stones, walls, &c.; but rather under the protection of angles,\r\nand in slight cavities--which agrees well with the habits of the insects\r\nin question. No doubt this was the true explanation of the phenomenon,\r\nbut it does not say much for the powers of observation which could have\r\nattributed it to blood, for the colour is by no means that of blood,\r\nespecially _dried_ blood, but much more crimson; and the earthy deposit,\r\nresembling chalk, which copiously remains after the fluid part has\r\nevaporated, would in a moment convince any one who was in the habit of\r\ncomparing things which differ, that, whatever the substance was, blood\r\nit certainly was not.\r\n\r\nI myself not long ago met with an appearance which bore a much closer\r\nresemblance to drops of blood than this, and which yet was referrible to\r\na widely different origin. In the neighbourhood of Ashburton, in Devon,\r\na quarter of a mile or so from the town, there is a shallow horse-pond,\r\nthe bottom of which consists of an impalpable whitish mud, much indented\r\nwith hoof-holes and other irregularities. In these, the water being\r\ndimly clear from settlement, I observed what looked exactly like blood,\r\nin numerous patches, the appearance being as if two or three drops of\r\nblood had fallen in one spot, half-a-dozen in another, and so on. The\r\ncolour was true, and even when I alighted, and looked carefully on the\r\nspots, they had just that curdled appearance that drops of blood assume\r\nwhen they fall into still water. But there appeared on minute\r\nexamination a constant intestine motion in each spot, which caused me to\r\nbring my eye closer, when I discovered that I had been egregiously\r\ndeceived. Each apparent drop of blood was formed of a number of slender\r\nworms, about as thick as a hog's bristle, and an inch and a half long,\r\nof a red hue, which protruded the greater part of their length from the\r\nmud, in a radiating form, each maintaining a constant undulatory\r\nmovement. There were more or fewer centres of radiation, the circles\r\nfrequently interrupted by, and merging into, others, just as drops of\r\nblood crowded together would do. On the slightest disturbance the little\r\nactors shrank out of sight into the soft mud; but by scooping up a\r\nlittle of this I contrived to get a number of them into a phial, which,\r\nas the sediment settled, were seen at the bottom playing as if in their\r\npond. On examination of the specimens with a microscope I found them to\r\nbe minute Annelids, such as I have described, apparently of the genus\r\n_Lumbriculus_ of Grube, with two rows of bristle-pencils, and two\r\nbristles in a pencil. The body was transparent and colourless, and the\r\nred hue was given by the great and conspicuous longitudinal\r\nblood-vessels, and by the lateral connecting vessels, which viewed\r\nsidewise took the form of loops. The animals soon died in captivity, but\r\nI kept some for three or four days alive.\r\n\r\nI have elsewhere referred to the curious phenomenon of crimson snow, and\r\nto the uncertainty which still hangs over its cause. I have lately met\r\nwith another explanation, which seems sufficiently guaranteed to be\r\ndepended on, though, as the red snow occurs in places where this cause\r\ncannot operate, it only shews that similar results may be produced by\r\ndiverse agencies. A certain resemblance between the facts and those\r\nadduced by M. Peiresc will warrant my quoting them. Mr Thomas Nicholson,\r\nin a visit to Sowallik Point, in Prince Regent's Inlet, thus describes\r\nwhat he saw:--\"The summit of the hill forming the point is covered with\r\nhuge masses of granite, while the side, which forms a gentle declivity\r\ntowards the bay, was covered with crimson snow. It was evident, at first\r\nview, that this colour was imparted to the snow by a substance lying on\r\nthe surface. This substance lay scattered here and there in small masses\r\nbearing some resemblance to powdered cochineal, surrounded by a lighter\r\nshade, which was produced by the colouring matter being partly dissolved\r\nand diffused by the deliquescent snow. During this examination our hats\r\nand upper garments were observed to be daubed with a substance of a\r\nsimilar red colour; and a moment's reflection convinced us that this was\r\nthe excrement of the little Auk, myriads of which bird were continually\r\nflying over our heads, having their nests among the loose masses of\r\ngranite. A ready explanation of the origin of the red snow was now\r\npresented to us, and not a doubt remained in the mind of any of us that\r\nthis was the correct one. The snow on the mountains of higher elevation\r\nthan the nests of these birds was perfectly white; and a ravine at a\r\nshort distance, which was filled with snow from top to bottom, but which\r\nafforded no hiding-place for these birds to form their nests, presented\r\nan appearance uniformly white.\"[70]\r\n\r\nAfter all, however, real _bonâ fide_ rain does sometimes descend, which,\r\nif not blood-red, is at least red. \"M. Giovanni Campani, Professor of\r\nChemistry at the University of Siena, has just published a letter,\r\naddressed to Professor Matteucci, on a most singular phenomenon which\r\noccurred at Siena in December last. On the 28th of that month, about\r\nseven A.M., the inhabitants of the northwestern part of the city\r\nwitnessed with surprise the curious phenomenon of a copious fall of rain\r\nof a reddish hue, which lasted two hours; a second shower of the same\r\ncolour occurred at eleven A.M., and a third at two P.M., but that of the\r\ndeepest red fell the first time. But what adds to the strangeness of the\r\noccurrence is that it was entirely confined to that particular quarter\r\nof the town, and so nicely was the line drawn that the cessation of the\r\nred colour was ascertained in one direction to be at about two hundred\r\nmètres from the meteorological observatory, the pluviometer of which\r\nreceived colourless rain at exactly the same time. The temperature\r\nduring the same interval varied between 8 deg. and 10 deg. Centigrade\r\n(46 and 50 Fahrenheit). The wind blew from the S.W. at the beginning of\r\nthe phenomenon, and afterwards changed to W.S.W. None of the rural\r\npopulation in the immediate vicinity of Siena remarked the occurrence,\r\nso that most probably the rain that fell round the town was colourless.\r\nThe same phenomenon, strange to say, recurred in exactly the same\r\nquarter of the town on the 31st of December, and again on the 1st of\r\nJanuary, the wind being W.N.W., and the temperature respectively 35 and\r\n39·42 deg., Fahrenheit. Each time, however, the red colour diminished\r\nin depth, its greatest strength having at no time exceeded that of weak\r\nwine and water. A similar occurrence is recorded as having taken place\r\nin 1819 at Blankenburg, when MM. Meyer and Stopp found the water to\r\ncontain a solution of chloride of cobalt. Professor Campani, who is now\r\nengaged, in conjunction with his colleague, Professor Gabrielli, in\r\nanalyzing the red water collected, has ascertained that in this instance\r\nit contains no chloride of cobalt, and, moreover, that the colour must\r\nbe owing to some solution, since the water has deposited no\r\nsediment.\"[71]\r\n\r\nThe occasional occurrence of large masses of water stained of a vivid\r\nred hue, and for the most part suddenly, and without any ostensible\r\ncause, has not unreasonably been recorded as a prodigy, rivalling one of\r\nthe plagues of Egypt--the turning of the waters into blood.\r\n\r\n\"I remember,\" says Mr Latrobe, \"the report reaching Neufchatel, through\r\nthe medium of the market-people passing from the one lake to the other,\r\n(some time during the winter,) that the waters of the lake of Morat had\r\nsuddenly become the colour of blood, though I could meet with no one\r\nwhose testimony was sufficiently clear and unequivocal to establish the\r\nfact. This, joined to my not having the leisure then to go and see for\r\nmyself, caused the matter to slip from my memory entirely, till I found\r\nmyself in the neighbourhood. Here the circumstance was fully confirmed\r\nto me in a manner not to be questioned; and having since met with a\r\npaper, written by M. de Candolle, of Geneva, on the subject, I shall\r\ntake what is there stated as my best guide in mentioning the facts as\r\nthey occurred:--\r\n\r\n\"It appears that this singular phenomenon began to excite the attention\r\nof the inhabitants of Morat as early as November last year, and that it\r\ncontinued more or less observable during the whole of the winter.\r\n\r\n\"Mr Trechsel, a gentleman resident at Morat, to whom M. de Candolle\r\napplied, on hearing the report, for information and specimens of the\r\ncolouring matter, stated--That during the early hours of the day no\r\nextraordinary appearance was observable in the lake; but that a little\r\nlater, long parallel lines of reddish matter were seen to extend along\r\nthe surface of the water, at some short distance from the banks. This,\r\nbeing blown by the wind towards the more sheltered parts of the shore,\r\ncollected itself about the reeds and rushes, covering the surface of the\r\nlake with a light foam; forming as it were different strata of various\r\ncolours, from greenish black, grey, yellow, and brown, to the most\r\ndelicious red. He adds, that this matter exhaled a pestiferous odour\r\nduring the day, but disappeared at the approach of night. It was further\r\nobserved, that during tempestuous weather it vanished altogether. Many\r\nsmall fishes were seen to become intoxicated while swimming amongst it,\r\nand after a few convulsive leaps, to lie motionless on the surface.\r\n\r\n\"The naturalists of Geneva decided, from the specimens sent, that it\r\nwas an animal substance, which, if not the _Oscillatoria subfusca_,[72]\r\nwas nearly allied to it.\r\n\r\n\"Soon after the beginning of May it disappeared entirely. It is not\r\nknown that this phenomenon has appeared before in the lake of Morat\r\nwithin the memory of man. Tradition states the same to have happened the\r\nyear preceding the great battle.\"[73]\r\n\r\nA few years ago, in one of my tanks of sea-water, there occurred a\r\nphenomenon much like this. Patches of a rich crimson-purple colour\r\nformed here and there on the surface, which rapidly grew on all sides\r\ntill they coalesced. If allowed to be a few days undisturbed, the entire\r\nsurface of the water became covered with a pellicle of the substance,\r\nwhich spread also over the stones and shells of the bottom, and the\r\nsides of the vessel. It could be lifted in impalpable laminæ on sheets\r\nof paper. I found it difficult to keep it within bounds, and impossible\r\nto get quite rid of it, till, after some months, I lost it by the\r\naccidental breaking of the vessel. Under the microscope, this proved an\r\n_Oscillatoria_, which I could not identify with any of the described\r\nspecies in Harvey's _Phytologia_: the filaments creeping and twining\r\nwith the peculiar vermicular movements of the genus.\r\n\r\nBlood-like waters are sometimes produced by a rapid evolution of\r\ninfusorial animalcules. Of these the most effective are _Astasia\r\nhæmatodes_, and _Euglena sanguinea_; both of them minute spindle-shaped\r\ncreatures of a pulpy substance, and sanguine hue. They are produced\r\noccasionally in incalculable numbers, increasing with vast rapidity by\r\nmeans of spontaneous division. Ehrenberg suggests that the miracle of\r\nblood-change performed on the Nile and on all other collections of water\r\nin Egypt by Moses (Exod. vii. 17-25) may have been effected by the\r\nagency of these animalcules. Of course it would require Divine power as\r\nmuch to educe uncounted millions of animalcules at the word of command,\r\nas to form real blood, so that no escape from the presence of Deity\r\nwould be gained by admitting the supposition; but the words of the\r\ninspired narrative seem to render it untenable.\r\n\r\nTo return to showers. \"If it should rain cats and dogs,\"--is a phrase\r\nwhich is in many mouths; but probably no one has heard it transferred\r\nfrom the subjunctive to the indicative mood. Why not, however, if it\r\nrains snails, frogs, fishes, and feathers? That these animals and animal\r\nproducts are really poured down from the atmosphere, I can adduce some\r\nevidence; the value of which my readers may weigh when they have heard\r\nthe pleadings.\r\n\r\nIn that venerable newspaper, _Felix Farley's Journal_, for July 1821,\r\nthere was \"an account of a wonderful quantity of snail-shells found in a\r\npiece of land of several acres near Bristol, that common report says\r\nfell in a shower.\" This shell-storm attracting much attention at the\r\ntime, Mr Wm. Baker, of Bridgewater, asked information from the Curator\r\nof the Bristol Institution, who thus cleared up the mystery:--\"The\r\nperiwinkles are indeed wonderful. They descended, forsooth, in a heavy\r\nrain-like shower on the field of Mr Peach, as a due punishment for his\r\ndisrespect to the virtues of our late queen. The shower was so intense,\r\nthat the umbrella of an old lady passing by was broken to pieces, and\r\nthe fragments lifted in the air by the whirlwind, which picked up all\r\nthe periwinkles on the neighbouring hills, and dropped them three inches\r\nthick on Mr Peach's field! But you know the story of 'The Three Black\r\nCrows;' and thus the whole is reduced to no periwinkle rain, no\r\nwhirlwind; but turns out to be our old friend _Helix virgata_, making\r\nits annual pilgrimage in search of a mate, and occurring one in almost\r\nevery square inch in the field in question.\"\r\n\r\nProvincial newspapers seem to have a special power of reporting such\r\nnatural history facts, which rarely survive investigation. The _Stroud\r\nFree Press_, for May 23, 1851, tells us that \"an extraordinary scene was\r\nwitnessed at Bradford, about twelve miles from Bristol, on Saturday\r\nweek, when that village was visited by a heavy shower of snails. They\r\nmight have been gathered by bushels.\" Mr J. W. Douglas, the eminent\r\nentomologist, immediately asked some pertinent questions anent the\r\nshower; but whether it was that the witnesses were grieved at his\r\nprofanely comparing such prodigies to Professors Morison and Holloway's\r\ncures, or whether they had no more definite intelligence to communicate,\r\n_certes_ echo answered not.\r\n\r\nWe fear we must give up snails. But frogs! everybody knows that toads\r\nand frogs fall from the sky. According to travellers in tropical\r\nAmerica, the inhabitants of Portobello assert that every drop of rain is\r\nchanged into a toad; the more instructed, however, believe that the\r\nspawn of these animals is raised with the vapour from the adjoining\r\nswamps, and being driven in the clouds over the city, the ova are\r\nhatched as they descend in rain. 'Tis certain that the streets after a\r\nnight of heavy rain are almost covered with the ill-favoured reptiles,\r\nand it is impossible to walk without crushing them.[74] But heretic\r\nphilosophers point to the mature growth of the vermin, many of them\r\nbeing six inches in length, and maintain that the clever hypothesis just\r\nmentioned will scarcely account for the appearance of these.\r\n\r\nIn the _Leeds Mercury_ for June 1844, there occurred the following\r\nstatement:--\"In the course of the afternoon of Monday last, during the\r\nprevalence of rather heavy rain, the good people of Selby were\r\nastonished at a remarkable phenomenon. It was rendered forcibly\r\napparent, that, with the descent of the rain, there was a shower of\r\nanother description, viz. a shower of frogs. The truth of this was\r\nrendered more manifest by the circumstance that several of the frogs\r\nwere caught in their descent by holding out hats for that purpose. They\r\nwere about the size of a horse-bean, and remarkably lively after their\r\naerial but wingless flight. The same phenomenon was observed in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood.\"\r\n\r\nThe editor of the _Zoologist_ immediately asked for confirmation of the\r\nstated facts, from resident persons of science; but notwithstanding the\r\ncircumstantiality of the account, and especially the reported actual\r\ncapture of the little sprawlers in hats, no one replied to the demand,\r\nand we are compelled to conclude that the report would not bear critical\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nYet incredulity may be pushed too far even here. For, in the continental\r\njournals many more such statements occur than in those of this country,\r\nand some of them vouched by apparently indisputable authority. If my\r\nreaders will refer to _L'Institut._ tom. ii. (1834) pp. 337, 346, 347,\r\n353, 354, 386, 409; tom. iv. (1836) pp. 221, 314, 325; tom. vi. (1838)\r\np. 212, they will find mention made of this phenomenon,--showers of\r\ntoads. In two or three of these cases, the toads were not only observed\r\nin countless numbers on the ground, during, and after, heavy storms of\r\nrain, but were seen to strike upon the roofs of houses, bounding thence\r\ninto the streets; they even fell upon the hats, umbrellas, and clothes\r\nof the observers, who were out in the storm, and, in one instance, were\r\nactually received into the outstretched hand.[75]\r\n\r\nMuch more recently, namely, early in 1859, the newspapers of South Wales\r\nrecorded a shower of fish in the Valley of Aberdare. The repeated\r\nstatements attracted more notice than usual, and the Rev. John Griffith,\r\nthe vicar of the parish, communicated the following results of his\r\ninquiries to the _Evening Mail_:--\r\n\r\n\"Many of your readers might, perhaps, like to see the facts connected\r\nwith this phenomenon. They will be better understood in the words of the\r\nprincipal witness, as taken down by me on the spot where it happened.\r\nThis man's name is John Lewis, a sawyer in Messrs Nixon and Co.'s yard.\r\nHis evidence is as follows:--'On Wednesday, February 9, I was getting\r\nout a piece of timber for the purpose of setting it for the saw, when I\r\nwas startled by something falling all over me--down my neck, on my head,\r\nand on my back. On putting my hand down my neck I was surprised to find\r\nthey were little fish. By this time I saw the whole ground covered with\r\nthem. I took off my hat, the brim of which was full of them. They were\r\njumping all about. They covered the ground in a long strip of about\r\neighty yards by twelve, as we measured afterwards. That shed (pointing\r\nto a very large workshop) was covered with them, and the shoots were\r\nquite full of them. My mates and I might have gathered bucketfuls of\r\nthem, scraping with our hands. We did gather a great many, about a\r\nbucketful, and threw them into the rain-pool, where some of them now\r\nare. There were two showers, with an interval of about ten minutes, and\r\neach shower lasted about two minutes or thereabouts. The time was eleven\r\nA.M. The morning up-train to Aberdare was just then passing. It was not\r\nblowing very hard, but uncommon wet, just about the same wind as there\r\nis to-day (blowing rather stiff), and it came from this quarter\r\n(pointing to the S. of W.). They came down with the rain in \"a body,\r\nlike.\"' Such is the evidence. I have taken it for the purpose of being\r\nlaid before Professor Owen, to whom, also, I shall send to-morrow, at\r\nthe request of a friend of his, eighteen or twenty of the little fish.\r\nThree of them are large and very stout, measuring about four inches. The\r\nrest are small. There were some--but they are since dead--fully five\r\ninches long. They are very lively.--Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                        \"JOHN GRIFFITH,\r\n                              \"Vicar of Aberdare and Rural Dean.\r\n          \"VICARAGE, ABERDARE, _March 8_.\"\r\n\r\nThe specimens which were forwarded to Professor Owen were exhibited in a\r\ntank at the Zoological Gardens in the Regent's Park: they consisted of\r\nminnows (_Leuciscus phoxinus_) and Smooth-tailed sticklebacks\r\n(_Gasterosteus leiurus_.) A _savant_ thus endeavoured to \"enlighten\" the\r\nuninitiated on the matter:--\"On reading the evidence it appears to me\r\nmost probably only a practical joke of the mates of John Lewis, who seem\r\nto have thrown a pailful of water with the fish in it over him, and he\r\nappears to have returned them to the pool from which they were\r\noriginally taken. The fish forwarded are very unlike those taken up in\r\nwhirlwinds in tropical countries, and we must make allowance for\r\nunintentional exaggerations of quantity, &c., in an account given a\r\nmonth after the event had occurred.\"\r\n\r\nThis \"appears to me\" a beautiful example of critical acumen. My readers\r\nwill do well to look at it for a moment; as they may thus learn how to\r\nsift the grain of truth out of the bushel of chaff. _Reverentèr\r\nprocedamus!_\r\n\r\nThe main (is it not the only?) objection to the honest sawyer's\r\nstatement is that \"the fish are very unlike those taken up in whirlwinds\r\nin tropical countries.\" That is, that, seeing the phenomenon occurs in\r\nGreat Britain, it is most unfortunate that the fishes are British\r\nspecies. Now, in India, when such things occur, it is always _Indian_\r\nspecies that are taken up; _ergo_, it ought to be Indian species _here_.\r\nBut these are \"very unlike\" the Indian fishes; _ergo_, it is manifestly\r\na humbug.\r\n\r\nThen, does it not strike one as palpably probable, when once one's dull\r\nintellect has been \"enlightened\" by the brilliant suggestion,--that the\r\nworthy sawyer who had a pail of water soused upon him, thought it was a\r\nheavy shower of rain? _Very_ heavy, no doubt; indeed he says it was\r\n\"uncommon wet.\" To be sure, he thought there were _two_ showers, each\r\nlasting about two minutes, with an interval of ten minutes between them;\r\nbut this little error might be easily made, for doubtless a bucket of\r\nwater poured on one's head might well be equivalent to two showers of\r\nrain, or even ten, for that matter. To be sure, moreover, there was a\r\nconsiderable quantity of fish:--\"The whole ground was covered with them:\r\nthey were jumping all about: they covered the ground in a long strip of\r\nabout eighty yards by twelve, _as we measured_ afterwards: the shed was\r\ncovered with them, and the shoots were quite full of them.... My mates\r\nand I might have gathered bucketfuls of them: we did gather about a\r\nbucketful.\" Yes, yes: but all were originally in the pail of water\r\nthrown over you, John. How stupid you were, not to perceive _that_! How\r\nthere was room for any water at all in the pail, seeing there were so\r\nmany fish, you say you don't know; but that is your stupidity, John!\r\nThere _must_ have been room for water, for it was \"uncommon wet;\" and\r\nthe water was in the pail, for the Doctor says so. Uncommon fishy, too,\r\nI should think; but let that pass. Where the mates collected the pail of\r\nlive fishes for their pleasant and profitable hoax, and how, and\r\nwhen,--the sceptic might wonderingly ask; but a hoax it was. _Ipse\r\ndixit._\r\n\r\nHowever, the verdict did not obtain universal assent; and an excellent\r\nand well-known naturalist, Mr Robert Drave, residing in the vicinity,\r\nventured modestly to indicate a dissent. \"I think actual fact will\r\nexcuse the otherwise apparently unbecoming assumption in me, of opposing\r\nsuch high authority by a contrary opinion, for from information\r\n_obtained from many sources, and very careful and minute_ inquiry, I am\r\nquite convinced that a great number of fish did actually descend with\r\nrain _over a considerable tract of country_. The specimens I obtained\r\n_from three individuals_, resident some distance from each other, were\r\nof two species, the common minnow and the three-spined stickleback; the\r\nformer most abundant, and mostly very small, though some had attained\r\ntheir full size.\"[76]\r\n\r\nIf now we look to other lands, we shall find that the descent of fishes\r\nfrom the atmosphere, under conditions little understood, is a phenomenon\r\nwhich rests on indubitable evidence. Humboldt has published interesting\r\ndetails of the ejection of fish in large quantities from volcanoes in\r\nSouth America. On the night between the 19th and 20th of June, 1698, the\r\nsummit of Carguairazo, a volcano more than 19,000 feet in height, fell\r\nin, and all the surrounding country for nearly thirty-two square miles\r\nwas covered with mud and fishes. A similar eruption of fish from the\r\nvolcano of Imbaburu was supposed to have been the cause of a putrid\r\nfever which raged in the town of Ibarra seven years before that period.\r\n\r\nThese facts are not inexplicable. Subterraneous lakes, communicating\r\nwith surface-waters, form in deep cavities in the declivities, or at the\r\nbase of a volcano. In certain active stages of ignition, these internal\r\ncavities are burst open, and their contents discharged through the\r\ncrater. Humboldt ascertained that the fishes in question belonged to a\r\ncurious and ill-favoured species of the _Siluridæ_,--the _Pimelodes\r\nCyclopum_.\r\n\r\nShowers of fishes, however, do occur, which cannot be connected with\r\nvolcanic agency. Dr Buist, in an interesting paper published in the\r\n_Bombay Times_ in 1856, has collected a number of authentic examples of\r\nthis phenomenon. The author, after enumerating the cases just cited, and\r\nothers of similar character, in which fishes were said to have been\r\nthrown out from volcanoes in South America, and precipitated from clouds\r\nin various parts of the world, adduces the following instances of\r\nsimilar occurrences in India:--\"In 1824,\" he says, \"fishes fell at\r\nMeerut, on the men of her Majesty's 14th Regiment, then out at drill,\r\nand were caught in numbers. In July 1826, live fish were seen to fall on\r\nthe grass at Moradabad during a storm. They were the common _Cyprinus_,\r\nso prevalent in our Indian waters. On the 19th of February 1830, at\r\nnoon, a heavy fall of fish occurred at the Nokulhatty factory, in the\r\nDaccah Zillah; depositions on the subject were obtained from nine\r\ndifferent parties. The fish were all dead; most of them were large; some\r\nwere fresh, others were rotten and mutilated. They were seen at first in\r\nthe sky, like a flock of birds, descending rapidly to the ground; there\r\nwas rain drizzling, but no storm. On the 16th and 17th of May, 1833, a\r\nfall of fish occurred in the Zillah of Futtehpoor, about three miles\r\nnorth of the Jumna, after a violent storm of wind and rain. The fish\r\nwere from a pound and a-half to three pounds in weight, and of the same\r\nspecies as those found in the tanks in the neighbourhood. They were all\r\ndead and dry. A fall of fish occurred at Allahabad, during a storm in\r\nMay 1835; they were of the chowla species, and were found dead and dry\r\nafter the storm had passed over the district. On the 20th of September\r\n1839 after a smart shower of rain, a quantity of live fish, about three\r\ninches in length, and all of the same kind, fell at the Sunderbunds,\r\nabout twenty miles south of Calcutta. On this occasion it was remarked\r\nthat the fish did not fall here and there irregularly over the ground,\r\nbut in a continuous straight line, not more than a span in breadth. The\r\nvast multitudes of fish, with which the low grounds round Bombay are\r\ncovered, about a week or ten days after the first burst of the monsoon,\r\nappear to be derived from the adjoining pools or rivulets, and not to\r\ndescend from the sky. They are not, as far as I know, found in the\r\nhigher parts of the island. I have never seen them, though I have\r\nwatched carefully, in casks collecting water from the roofs of\r\nbuildings, or heard of them on the decks or awnings of vessels in the\r\nharbour, where they must have appeared had they descended from the sky.\r\nOne of the most remarkable phenomena of this kind occurred during a\r\ntremendous deluge of rain at Kattywar, on the 25th of July 1850, when\r\nthe ground around Rajkote was found literally covered with fish; some of\r\nthem were found on the top of haystacks, where probably they had been\r\ndrifted by the storm. In the course of twenty-four successive hours\r\ntwenty-seven inches of rain fell, thirty-five fell in twenty-six hours,\r\nseven inches in one hour and a-half, being the heaviest fall on record.\r\nAt Poonah, on the 3d of August 1852, after a very heavy fall of rain,\r\nmultitudes of fish were caught on the ground in the cantonments, full\r\nhalf a mile from the nearest stream. If showers of fish are to be\r\nexplained on the assumption that they are carried up by squalls or\r\nviolent winds, from rivers or spaces of water not far away from, where\r\nthey fall, it would be nothing wonderful were they seen to descend from\r\nthe air during the furious squalls which occasionally occur in June.\"\r\n\r\nSir E. Tennent adds the following examples:--\"I had an opportunity, on\r\none occasion only, of witnessing the phenomenon which gives rise to this\r\npopular belief. I was driving in the cinnamon gardens near the fort of\r\nColombo, and saw a violent but partial shower descend at no great\r\ndistance before me. On coming to the spot, I found a multitude of small\r\nsilvery fish from one and a half to two inches in length, leaping on the\r\ngravel of the high road, numbers of which I collected and brought away\r\nin my palankin. The spot was about half a mile from the sea, and\r\nentirely unconnected with any watercourse or pool.\r\n\r\n\"Mr Whiting, who was many years resident at Trincomalee, writes me that\r\nhe 'had been often told by the natives on that side of the island that\r\nit sometimes rained fishes; and on one occasion (he adds) I was taken by\r\nthem, in 1849, to a field at the village of Karrancotta-tivo, near\r\nBatticaloa, which was dry when I passed over it in the morning, but had\r\nbeen covered in two hours by sudden rain to the depth of three inches,\r\nin which there was then a quantity of small fish. The water had no\r\nconnexion with any pond or stream whatsoever.' Mr Cripps, in like\r\nmanner, in speaking of Galle, says: 'I have seen in the vicinity of the\r\nfort, fish taken from rain-water that had accumulated in the hollow\r\nparts of the land that in the hot season are perfectly dry and parched.\r\nThe place is accessible to no running stream or tank; and either the\r\nfish, or the spawn from which they were produced, must of necessity have\r\nfallen with the rain.'\"[77]\r\n\r\nMr J. Prinsep, the eminent secretary to the Asiatic Society of Bengal,\r\nfound a fish in the pluviometer at Calcutta, in 1838.[78]\r\n\r\nIt is a highly curious fact that the pools, reservoirs, and tanks in\r\nIndia and Ceylon are well provided with fish of various species, though\r\nthe water twice every year becomes perfectly evaporated, and the mud of\r\nthe bottom becomes converted into dust, or takes the condition of baked\r\nclay, gaping with wide and deep clefts, in which not the slightest sign\r\nof moisture can be detected. This is the case with temporary hollows in\r\nthe soil, which have no connexion with running streams or permanent\r\nwaters, from which they might be supposed to receive a fresh stock of\r\nfish.\r\n\r\nTwo modes of accounting for this strange phenomenon have obtained\r\ncurrency. The one is that received by those Europeans who are content\r\nwith any solution of a difficulty, without too closely testing it; viz.,\r\nthat the fishes fall with the rains from the air. The actual occurrence\r\nof such showers rests, as we have just seen, on good evidence; but,\r\nadmitting the fact, it must be a rare phenomenon, whereas the presence\r\nof fish in the new-made pools is universal. Again, if the rains brought\r\nthem in such abundance as to stock all the pools, an equal number would\r\nfall on the dry ground, which is not pretended to be the case. The other\r\naccepted solution is that which has received the sanction of Mr Yarrell,\r\nwho observes--\"The impregnated ova of the fish of one rainy season are\r\nleft unhatched in the mud through the dry season, and from their low\r\nstate of organisation _as ova_, the vitality is preserved till the\r\noccurrence and contact of the rain and the oxygen of the next wet\r\nseason, when vivification takes place from their joint influence.\"[79]\r\n\r\nThis may be fully allowed, yet it does not meet the exigences of the\r\ncase. Sir E. Tennent and others have shewn that it is not young fishes\r\njust escaped from the egg which appear in the new-formed pools, but\r\nfull-grown fishes, fit for the market; a fact well known to the\r\nSingalese fishermen, who resort to the hollows as soon as the monsoon\r\nhas brought rain; and they invariably take in these pools, which a day\r\nor two before were as dry as dust, plenty of fishes fully grown, a foot\r\nor eighteen inches long, or longer.\r\n\r\nNeither of these hypotheses, then, will account for the fact: and we\r\nmust admit that the fishes of these regions have the instinct to burrow\r\ndown in the solid mud of the bottom, at the approach of the dry season,\r\nand the power of retaining life, doubtless in a torpid condition, until\r\nthe return of the periodic rains, as Theophrastus long ago observed.[80]\r\n\r\nThe _Lepidosiren_, a very remarkable genus of animals from Africa and\r\nSouth America, affords a curious illustration of this power. It is\r\naltogether a highly singular creature, and has attracted a great deal of\r\nnotice because its organisation belongs to two types: it is, so to\r\nspeak, placed midway between the great classes of Reptiles and Fishes,\r\nthe characters which identify it with either being almost equally\r\nbalanced. Professor Owen and other eminent physiologists regard it as a\r\nfish, while Professor Bischoff, with others equally learned, consider it\r\nan Amphibian reptile.\r\n\r\nIt is the habits of this strange creature, however, which induce me to\r\nnotice it here. An inhabitant of rivers and ponds, which are swollen by\r\nperiodic rains, and subject to entire or partial desiccation by long\r\ndroughts, it is liable to be left by the retreating waters, exposed to\r\nthe burning sun, under which it would presently die, but for a special\r\nprovision.\r\n\r\nThe animal has the instinct to bury itself in the mud of the bottom, on\r\nthe approach of the droughts, penetrating to a depth of several feet.\r\nThere it coils itself into a ball, with the tail folded over the nose,\r\nbut so as to leave the nasal apertures uncovered; and, probably by its\r\nwrigglings, it forms a cavity or chamber in the clay, which becomes\r\nlined with a membranous slough thrown off from its body. Meanwhile the\r\nwater evaporates, the mud dries, bakes, and cracks under the torrid heat\r\nof the dry season, thus allowing air to penetrate down to the retreat of\r\nthe torpid mud-fish, in sufficient quantity for its very sluggish\r\nrespiration. Here it lies inactive for five or six months, until the wet\r\nseason again sets in, and the returning floods cover the old beds,\r\nsoften the baked clay, revivify the imprisoned animal, and restore it to\r\nliberty and aquatic locomotion.\r\n\r\nTo meet these strange conditions of life, the _Lepidosiren_ is furnished\r\nwith a twofold apparatus for respiration; the one aquatic, consisting\r\nof gills, ordinarily contained in a branchial chamber, (but in one\r\nspecies, at least, external,) suited for the separation of oxygen from\r\nthe water, and the other aerial, consisting of true lungs, closely\r\nresembling those of serpents, though manifestly only a modification of\r\nthe well-known swim-bladder of many fishes,--by means of which the\r\nanimal breathes atmospheric air, during its periodic captivity.\r\n\r\nThe same emergency is met by other species in another way. It does not\r\nappear that the _Lepidosiren_ has the power of voluntarily forsaking the\r\nwater, or of travelling on land, notwithstanding its twofold\r\nrespiration; but some of the fishes of the tropics certainly resort to\r\nthis mode of evading the fatal contingency of being baked out by the\r\nevaporating power of the periodical dry season.\r\n\r\nTheophrastus, the contemporary of Aristotle, mentions fishes found in\r\nthe Euphrates which in the dry seasons leave the vacant channels and\r\ncrawl over the ground in search of water, moving along by fins and\r\ntail.[81] Pallegoix gives three kinds of fish in Siam, which leave the\r\ntanks and channels and travel through the grass;[82] and Sir John\r\nBowring states that in ascending the river Meinam to Bangkok, he was\r\namused with the sight of fish leaving the stream, gliding over the wet\r\nbanks, till they disappeared among the trees of the jungle.[83] The\r\n_Hydragyræ_ of Carolina in like manner leave the drying pools, and seek\r\nthe nearest water in a straight line, though at a considerable distance.\r\nAnd Sir R. Schomburgk tells us that certain species of _Dora_ in Guiana\r\nhave the same habit, and are occasionally met with in such numbers in\r\ntheir terrestrial travels that the negroes fill baskets with them.[84]\r\n\r\nThese fishes, provincially called Hassars, project themselves on their\r\nbony pectoral fins, aiding their advance by the elastic spring of the\r\ntail exerted sidewise, proceeding in this manner nearly as fast as a man\r\ncan walk. The strong scaly bands which envelop the body facilitate the\r\nmarch, in the same way as the transverse plates (_scuta_) on the belly\r\nof serpents, which take hold of the ground, as the ribs perform the\r\noffice of feet. The Indians know that these fishes have the power of\r\ncarrying a supply of water in a reservoir, for the keeping of the gills\r\nin a moist condition. If they fail in finding water, they are said to\r\nburrow in the still soft mud, and pass the dry season in torpidity like\r\nthe _Lepidosiren_.\r\n\r\nThe common eel is well known to have this habit of travelling with us; I\r\nwell remember my surprise, when a boy, at finding an eel in a grassy\r\nmeadow one dewy summer evening, at a considerable distance from water.\r\nSince then I have seen a small species of _Antennarius_, running quickly\r\nto and fro on the surface of the great beds of floating sea-weed in the\r\nGulf stream, progressing by means of its pectorals and ventrals quite\r\nout of water, with the utmost facility.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CLIMBING PERCH.]\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated example of this faculty, however, is the climbing\r\nperch (_Anabas scandens_) of India. The vagaries of this little fish\r\nhave been recorded from the earliest times, and numerous modern\r\nwitnesses have borne record to its powers. Mr E. Layard once encountered\r\nseveral travelling along a hot dusty gravel-road in the mid-day sun.[85]\r\nDaldorf, a Danish zoologist of reputation, asserts that he has seen this\r\nspecies in the act of climbing palm-trees, effecting its ascent by means\r\nof fins and tail, with the aid of its spinous gill-covers. There is,\r\nhowever, some doubt whether he was not under mistake in this, though the\r\nfact of its crawling up the banks and living out of water is abundantly\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nOn the coasts of Ceylon, according to its accomplished historian,--on\r\nthe rocks which are washed by the surf, there are multitudes of a\r\ncurious little fish, (_Salarias alticus_,) which possesses the faculty\r\nof darting along the surface of the water, and running up the wet\r\nstones, with the utmost ease and rapidity. By aid of its pectoral and\r\nventral fins and gill-cases, it moves across the damp sand, ascends the\r\nroots of the mangroves, and climbs up the smooth face of the rocks in\r\nsearch of flies; adhering so securely as not to be detached by repeated\r\nassaults of the waves. These little creatures are so nimble, that it is\r\nalmost impossible to lay hold of them, as they scramble to the edge, and\r\nplunge into the sea on the slightest attempt to molest them. They are\r\nfrom three to four inches in length, and of a dark-brown colour, almost\r\nindistinguishable from the rocks they frequent.[86]\r\n\r\nIn all these cases probably, the power of sustaining a protracted\r\nprivation of water depends on a peculiar structure of the pharynx, which\r\nis divided by membranous plates into cells which the fish can fill at\r\npleasure with water, and by ejecting small portions at a time can\r\nmoisten its gills, and thus preserve the filaments of these organs in a\r\nfit condition to maintain the circulation and oxygenation of the blood.\r\nThese labyrinthal water-chambers are particularly numerous and\r\ncomplicated in the _Anabas_ just mentioned. This, however, has no\r\nanalogy with the lung of the _Lepidosiren_.\r\n\r\n[70] _Mag. Nat.

This strange monster sojourned among\r\nthe rude people during the day, taking no food, but retiring to the sea\r\nagain at night; and continued for some time, teaching them the arts of\r\ncivilised life. Other ancient authors, as Polyhistor and Apollodorus,\r\nallude to the same tradition; and we gather that the portrait of the\r\nlearned stranger (not painted _from the life_, we may presume,\r\nconsidering the condition of the people when he appeared, unless we may\r\nsuppose it to have been the effort of one of his pupils in the pictorial\r\nart under his instruction) was preserved at Babylon to the historic\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nIn an elaborate sculpture of the later Assyrian period, discovered by M.\r\nBotta at Khorsabad, a maritime expedition is portrayed, and the sea\r\naround the ships is filled with various marine animals, and among them\r\nthe compound mythic forms of winged bulls and bull-lions, in which the\r\nAssyrians delighted, together with a figure composed of the body and\r\ntail of a fish extended horizontally, and the perpendicular trunk and\r\nforeparts of a man, crowned with the sacred cap, possibly representing\r\nthe traditional Oannes.\r\n\r\nThe god Dagon of the Philistines, and the goddess Atergatis of the\r\nSyrians were worshipped under the same combination of the human and\r\npiscine forms, and the Tritons of classical mythology perpetuated the\r\nidea.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that in almost all ages and in almost all countries there\r\nshould have prevailed a belief in the actual living existence of\r\ncreatures like this. Was the mythological symbol the origin of the\r\npersuasion? Or is there any marine animal uniting so much of the general\r\nform of the fish with that of man as to have given the conception of the\r\nidol? A naturalist of deserved eminence has maintained, on purely\r\nscientific grounds, that such an animal must exist,--that the laws of\r\nnature absolutely require such a being; and though the amount of force\r\nwhich his reasoning, possesses will be estimated differently according\r\nas we reject or accept the hypothesis of the circularity of the great\r\nplan of nature, we may as well see what he has to say for a marine\r\nprimate,--be he man or ape, mermaid or mermonkey.\r\n\r\n\"There is yet,\" says Mr Swainson, \"another primary type necessary to\r\ncomplete the circle of the quadrumanous animals, and it is that which we\r\nhave elsewhere distinguished as the natatorial; but of such an animal we\r\nhave only vague and indefinite accounts. It will be seen that,\r\nthroughout the whole class of quadrupeds, the aquatic types are\r\nremarkably few, and in general scarce; and that they contain fewer forms\r\nor examples than any other, and are often, in the smaller groups,\r\nentirely wanting. To account for this is altogether impossible; we can\r\nonly call attention to the fact, as exemplified in the aquatic order of\r\n_Cetacea_, in that of the _Feræ_, in the _Pachydermata_, in the circle\r\nof the _Glires_, and in all the remaining natatorial types of the\r\ndifferent circles of quadrupeds. We do not implicitly believe in the\r\nexistence of mermaids as described and depicted by the old writers--with\r\na comb in the one hand and a mirror in the other; but it is difficult to\r\nimagine that the numerous records of singular marine animals, unlike any\r\nof those well known, have their origin in fraud or gross ignorance. Many\r\nof these narratives are given by eye-witnesses of the facts they vouch\r\nfor--men of honesty and probity, having no object to gain by deception,\r\nand whose accounts have been confirmed by other witnesses equally\r\ntrustworthy. Can it be supposed that the unfathomable depths of ocean\r\nare without their _peculiar_ inhabitants, whose habits and economy\r\nrarely, if ever, bring them to the surface of the watery element? As\r\nreasonably might a Swiss mountaineer disbelieve in the existence of an\r\nostrich, because it cannot inhabit his Alpine precipices, as that we\r\nshould doubt that the rocks and caverns of the ocean are without animals\r\ndestined to live in such situations, and such only. The natatorial type\r\nof the _Quadrumana_, however, is most assuredly wanting. Whatever its\r\nprecise construction may or might have been, it would represent and\r\ncorrespond to the seals in the circle of the _Feræ_, or rapacious\r\nquadrupeds; while a resemblance to the _Simiadæ_, or monkeys, must be\r\nconsidered an essential character of any marine animal which is to\r\nconnect and complete the circular series of types in the _Quadrumana_.\"\r\n\r\nMr Swainson absolutely excludes Man from the zoological circle, on\r\ngrounds which few naturalists are disposed to think sufficient; else we\r\nmight suggest that man himself is the natatorial type of the _Primates_.\r\nTaking this author's own selection[87] of the characters which mark the\r\nnatatorial types of animals, for our guide, we find that the largest\r\nsize, the smallest fore-limbs, the most obtuse muzzle, the most\r\ncarnivorous appetite, and the most natatory habits (for I do not know\r\nthat the Apes, or the Sapajous, or the Lemurs, or the Bats, ever take to\r\nthe water voluntarily, whereas savage Man is always a great swimmer),\r\nbelong to Man, and so, _Swainsonio ipso judice_, constitute _him_ the\r\ntrue aquatic primate. But if so, we do not want a merman or mermonkey;\r\nnay, we should not know where to insert him in the zoological circle if\r\nwe found him; he would be awkwardly _de trop_.\r\n\r\nBut yet nature _has_ an awkward way of mocking at our impossibilities;\r\nand it _may be_ that green-haired maidens with oary tails lurk in the\r\nocean caves, and keep mirrors and combs upon their rocky shelves.\r\nCertainly the belief in them is very widely spread, and occasionally\r\ncomes to us from quarters where we should hardly have looked for it. A\r\nnegro from Dongola assured Prince Puckler Muskau that in the country of\r\nSennaar there was no doubt that Sirens (mermaids) still existed, for\r\nthat he himself had seen more than one.[88]\r\n\r\nIn my boyhood I well recollect being highly excited by the arrival in\r\nour town, at fair-time, of a \"show,\" which professed to exhibit a\r\nmermaid, whose portrait, on canvas hung outside, was radiant in feminine\r\nloveliness and piscine scaliness. I fondly expected to see the very\r\ncounterpart within, how disposed I did not venture to imagine, but alive\r\nand fascinating, of course. Had I not seen her picture? I joyfully paid\r\nmy coppers, but oh! woful disappointment! I dimly saw, within a dusty\r\nglass case, in a dark corner, a shrivelled and blackened little thing\r\nwhich might have been moulded in mud for aught I could see, but which\r\nwas labelled, \"MERMAID!\" So great was my disgust, so bitter my feelings\r\nof shame and anger at having been so grossly taken in, that I did not\r\ncare to observe what might have been noteworthy in it. I read afterwards\r\nthat it was a very ingenious cheat; the trunk and head of a monkey had\r\nbeen grafted on to the body and tail of a large salmon-like fish, and\r\nthe junction had been so cleverly effected, that only a very close\r\nexamination detected the artifice. It professed to have been brought\r\nfrom China, but possibly was an importation even thither, if Steinmetz\r\nis correct. According to this writer, \"A Japanese fisherman contrived to\r\nunite the upper half of a monkey to the lower half of a fish, so neatly\r\nas to defy ordinary inspection. He then gave out that he had caught the\r\ncreature alive in his net, but that it had died shortly after being\r\ntaken out of the water; and he derived considerable pecuniary profit\r\nfrom his cunning in more ways than one. The exhibition of the\r\nsea-monster to Japanese curiosity paid well; but yet more productive was\r\nthe assertion that the half-human fish, having spoken the few minutes it\r\nexisted out of its native element, had predicted a certain number of\r\nyears of wonderful fertility, and a fatal epidemic, the only remedy for\r\nwhich would be possession of the marine prophet's likeness. The sale of\r\nthese pictured mermaids was immense. Either this composite animal, or\r\nanother, the offspring of the success of the first, was sold at the\r\nDutch factory, and transmitted to Batavia, where it fell into the hands\r\nof a speculating American, who brought it to Europe, and here, in the\r\nyears 1822-3, exhibited his purchase as a real mermaid at every capital,\r\nto the admiration of the ignorant, the perplexity of the learned, and\r\nthe filling of his own purse. Indeed, the mermaids exhibited in Europe\r\nand America, to the great profit of the enterprising showmen, have all\r\nbeen of Japanese manufacture.\"[89]\r\n\r\nThis, however, will not account for the frequent reports of the living\r\ncreatures having been seen, and unbelievers have to form some other\r\nhypothesis. In the tropical seas the cow-whales, uncouth marine\r\n_pachydermata_, have been assumed to be the originals of these stories.\r\nMegasthenes reported that the sea which washed Taprobane, the modern\r\nCeylon, was inhabited by a creature having the appearance of a woman;\r\nand Ælian improves the account by stating that there are whales having\r\nthe form of satyrs. 'Tis true the Manatee and the Dugong are rather\r\nmer-swine than mer-maids; but there is something in the bluff round head\r\nwhich may remind a startled observer of the human form divine. Sir\r\nEmerson Tennent considers that this rude approach to the human outline,\r\nand the attitude of the mother while suckling her young, pressing it to\r\nher breast with one paw, while swimming with the other, the head of both\r\nbeing held perpendicularly above water, and then, when disturbed,\r\nsuddenly diving and displaying her broad fin-like tail,--these, together\r\nwith her habitual demonstrations of strong maternal affection, may\r\nprobably have been the original from which the pictures of the mermaid\r\nwere portrayed, and thus that earliest invention of mythical physiology\r\nmay be traced to the Arab seamen and to the Greeks, who had watched the\r\nmovements of the Dugong in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe early Portuguese settlers in India had no doubt that true mermen\r\nwere found in those seas; and the annalist of the exploits of the\r\nJesuits narrates that seven of these monsters, male and female, were\r\ncaptured at Manaar in 1560, and carried to Goa, where they were\r\ndissected by Demas Bosquez, physician to the Viceroy, and \"their\r\ninternal structure found to be in all respects conformable to the\r\nhuman.\" Making allowance for the very limited acquaintance which the\r\nworthy physician was likely to have made with human anatomy by actual\r\nautopsy, this statement goes for little:--the real resemblance, assuming\r\nthem to have been Dugongs, was about the same as that presented by the\r\nhog, whose inwards are popularly believed by our own country people to\r\nbe in very close accordance with those of \"Christians.\"\r\n\r\nSir E. Tennent has embellished his book with a very taking portrait of\r\nthe mermaid on the Dugong hypothesis; shewing two females, each holding\r\na baby [is it right to say _merbaby_?], emerging from the sea-wave; they\r\ndo look, to be sure, sufficiently human, but the well-known monogram of\r\nour clever friend Wolf in the corner of the cut suggests shrewd doubts\r\nthat the portraits were not \"_ad viv_.\"\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, among the Scandinavian races that the belief in the\r\nmerman has reached its culminating point. So many particulars are\r\ninculcated concerning the mode and conditions of life of these submarine\r\nbeings, that the most intimate relations appear to have subsisted\r\nbetween the terrestrial and the aquatic peoples. According to the creed\r\nof the Norsemen, there exists, far beneath the depths of the ocean, an\r\natmosphere adapted to the breathing organs of beings resembling in form\r\nthe human race, endowed with surpassing beauty, with limited\r\nsupernatural powers, but liable to suffering, and even to death. Their\r\ndwelling is in a vast region, situate far below the bottom of the sea,\r\nwhich forms a canopy over them, like the sky over us, and there they\r\ninhabit houses constructed of the pearly and coralline productions of\r\nthe ocean. Having lungs not adapted to a watery medium, but formed for\r\nbreathing atmospheric air, it would be impossible for them to pass\r\nthrough the volume of waters that separates our world from theirs, if it\r\nwere not that they possess the power of entering the skin of some marine\r\nanimal, whose faculties they thus temporarily acquire, or of changing\r\ntheir own form and structure so as to suit the altered condition through\r\nwhich they are to travel. The most ordinary shape they assume is, as\r\neverybody knows, that of man (that is, their own proper form) from the\r\nwaist upward, but below that of a fish. Whether they now breathe by\r\ngills or lungs, the anatomists, it seems, have not yet determined; we\r\nmust presume the former alternative, since else it is not apparent what\r\nthey have gained by their piscine metamorphosis of tail; though where\r\nthe branchiæ are situate we are a little at a loss to imagine. These,\r\nhowever, are matters which doubtless the scientific world will one day\r\ndetermine: it seems certain that they do thus acquire an amphibious\r\nnature, so as not only to exist submerged in the waters, but to land on\r\nthe shores of our sunny world, where they frequently doff their fishy\r\nhalf, resume their proper human form, and pass muster while they pursue\r\ntheir investigations here.[90]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, but one of these resources can ever be availed of by any\r\nindividual mer-man or -maid, nor can any \"son or daughter of the ocean\r\nborrow more than one sea-dress of this kind for his own particular use;\r\ntherefore if the garb should be mislaid on the shores he never can\r\nreturn to his submarine country and friends. A Shetlander, having once\r\nfound an empty seal-skin on the shore, took it home and kept it in his\r\npossession. Soon after, he met the most lovely being who ever stepped on\r\nthe earth, wringing her hands with distress, and loudly lamenting, that,\r\nhaving lost her sea-dress, she must remain for ever on the earth. The\r\nShetlander, having fallen in love at first sight, said not a syllable\r\nabout finding this precious treasure, but made his proposals, and\r\noffered to take her for better or for worse, as his future wife! The\r\nmerlady, though not, as we know, much a woman of the world, very\r\nprudently accepted the offer! I never heard what the settlements were,\r\nbut they lived very happily for some years, till one day, when the\r\ngreen-haired bride unexpectedly discovered her long-lost seal-skin, and\r\ninstantly putting it on, she took a hasty farewell of everybody, and ran\r\ntowards the shore. Her husband flew out in pursuit of her, but in vain!\r\nShe sprang from point to point, and from rock to rock, till at length,\r\nhastening into the ocean, she disappeared for ever, leaving the worthy\r\nman, her husband, perfectly planet-struck and inconsolable on the\r\nshore!\"[91]\r\n\r\nNor are there lacking in the rocky cliffs of our own northern islands\r\nfit lodgings for these sea kings and queens. The gifted pen of Sir\r\nWalter Scott has sketched one of these from his own observation:\r\n\"Imagination can hardly conceive anything more beautiful than the\r\nextraordinary grotto discovered not many years since upon the estate of\r\nAlexander MacAllister, Esq. of Strathaird [in Skye]. The first entrance\r\nto this celebrated cave is rude and unpromising: but the light of the\r\ntorches with which we were provided, was soon reflected from the roof,\r\nfloor, and walls, which seemed as if they were sheeted with marble,\r\npartly smooth, partly rough with frostwork and rustic ornaments, and\r\npartly seeming to be wrought into statuary. The floor forms a steep and\r\ndifficult ascent, and might be fancifully compared to a sheet of water,\r\nwhich, while it rushed whitening and foaming down a declivity, had been\r\nsuddenly arrested and consolidated by the spell of an enchanter. Upon\r\nattaining the summit of this ascent, the cave opens into a splendid\r\ngallery, adorned with the most dazzling crystallizations, and finally\r\ndescends with rapidity to the brink of a pool, of the most limpid water,\r\nabout four or five yards broad. There opens beyond this pool a portal\r\narch, formed by two columns of white spar, with beautiful chasing upon\r\nthe sides, which promises a continuation of the cave. One of our sailors\r\nswam across, for there is no other mode of passing, and informed us (as\r\nindeed we partly saw by the light he carried) that the enchantment of\r\nMacAllister's cave terminates with this portal, a little beyond which\r\nthere was only a rude cavern, speedily choked with stones and earth. But\r\nthe pool on the brink of which we stood, surrounded by the most fanciful\r\nmouldings, in a substance resembling white marble, and distinguished by\r\nthe depth and purity of its waters, might have been the bathing grotto\r\nof a naiad. The groups of combined figures projecting or embossed, by\r\nwhich the pool is surrounded, are exquisitely elegant and fanciful. A\r\nstatuary might catch beautiful hints from the singular and romantic\r\ndisposition of those stalactites. There is scarce a form or group on\r\nwhich active fancy may not trace figures or grotesque ornaments, which\r\nhave been gradually moulded in this cavern by the dropping of the\r\ncalcareous water hardening into petrifactions. Many of these fine groups\r\nhave been injured by the senseless rage for appropriation of recent\r\ntourists; and the grotto has lost, (I am informed,) through the smoke of\r\ntorches, something of that vivid silver tint which was originally one of\r\nits chief distinctions. But enough of beauty remains to compensate for\r\nall that may be lost.\"[92]\r\n\r\nBut these tales are the _nugæ canoræ_ of the naturalist. Once more,--Is\r\nthere any substratum of truth underlying these fancies? or must they be\r\nunhesitatingly dismissed to the region of fable? Certainly, if there\r\nwere not two or three narratives which have an air of veracity and\r\ndependableness, bearing out the belief to some slight extent, I should\r\nnot have noticed it here.\r\n\r\nHow simple and circumstantial is this story told by old Hudson, the\r\nrenowned navigator! a man whose narrative is more than usually dry and\r\ndestitute of everything like, not only imagination, but even an\r\nimaginative aspect of ordinary circumstances. On the 15th of June, when\r\nin lat. 75°, trying to force a passage to the pole near Nova Zembla, he\r\nrecords the following incident: \"This morning one of our company\r\nlooking overboard saw a mermaid; and calling up some of the company to\r\nsee her, one more came up, and by that time she was come close to the\r\nship's side, looking earnestly on the men. A little after, a sea came\r\nand overturned her. From the navel upward, her back and breasts were\r\nlike a woman's, as they say that saw her; her body as big as one of us;\r\nher skin very white; and long hair hanging down behind, of colour black.\r\nIn her going down they saw her tail, which was like the tail of a\r\nporpoise, and speckled like a mackerel. Their names that saw her were\r\nThomas Hilles and Robert Rayner.\"[93]\r\n\r\nWhatever explanation be attempted of this apparition, the ordinary\r\nresource of seal or walrus will not avail here. Seals and walruses must\r\nhave been as familiar to these Polar mariners as cows to a dairy-maid.\r\nUnless the whole story was a concerted lie between the two men,\r\nreasonless and objectless,--and the worthy old navigator doubtless knew\r\nthe character of his men,--they must have seen, in the black-haired,\r\nwhite-skinned creature, some form of being as yet unrecognised.\r\n\r\nSteller, a zoologist of some repute, who examined the natural history of\r\nthe Siberian seas, reports having seen, near Behring's Straits, a\r\nstrange animal, which he calls a Sea-ape. \"It was about five feet long,\r\nwith a head like a dog's; the ears sharp and erect, and the eyes large;\r\non both lips it had a kind of beard; the form of the body was thick and\r\nround, but tapering to the tail, which was bifurcated, with the upper\r\nlobe longest; the body was covered with thick hair, grey on the back,\r\nand red on the belly. Steller could not discover any feet or paws. It\r\nwas full of frolic, and sported in the manner of a monkey, swimming\r\nsometimes on one side of the ship and sometimes on the other, and\r\nlooking at it with seeming surprise. It would come so near the ship that\r\nit might be touched with a pole; but if any one stirred, it would\r\nimmediately retire. It often raised one third of its body above the\r\nwater, and stood upright for a considerable time; then suddenly darted\r\nunder the ship, and appeared in the same attitude on the other side;\r\nthis it would repeat for thirty times together. It would frequently\r\nbring up a sea plant, not unlike a bottle-gourd, which it would toss\r\nabout and catch again in its mouth, playing numberless fantastic tricks\r\nwith it.\"\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in this description which would exclude it from\r\nwell-recognised zoological classification. It is highly probable that it\r\nwas one of the seal tribe, but of a species, perhaps a genus, not yet\r\nidentified. All analogy would suggest that fore-paws must have been\r\npresent in an animal with a dog-like head, and clothed with hair; but\r\nthey were perhaps small,--smaller even than in other _Phocadæ_, and may\r\nhave been so concealed in the long hair, or held so closely pressed to\r\nthe body, as not to be visible. The only other difficulty is in the\r\nposterior extremity. This is described by Steller in terms that imply a\r\ntrue piscine tail, expanded in a direction vertical to the plane of the\r\nbody, and of that peculiar form called _heterocercal_, which\r\ndistinguishes the cartilaginous families of Fishes, the Sharks and Rays.\r\nBut the animal was indubitably a Mammal; and therefore we may almost\r\nwith certainty assume that, if the body terminated in a natatory\r\nexpansion, it would be, as in the whales, and manatees, a horizontal\r\nexpansion, and not a vertical one. But if the strange creature was\r\nindeed, as I conclude, of the Phocine type, we have only to suppose the\r\ntail, which is usually very small in this family, to have been so\r\ngreatly developed, as to exceed the united hind feet, which may have\r\nbeen small, and the appearance, seen momentarily, and in the wash of the\r\nwaves, might well seem that of a heterocercal tail.\r\n\r\nCaptain Weddell, well known for his geographical discoveries in the\r\nextreme south of the globe, relates the following story: \"A boat's crew\r\nwere employed on Hall's Island, when one of the crew, left to take care\r\nof some produce, saw an animal whose voice was even musical. The sailor\r\nhad lain down, and about ten o'clock he heard a noise resembling human\r\ncries; and as daylight in these latitudes never disappears at this\r\nseason, he rose and looked around; but, on seeing no person, returned to\r\nbed; presently he heard the noise again; rose a second time, but still\r\nsaw nothing. Conceiving, however, the possibility of a boat being upset,\r\nand that some of the crew might be clinging to some detached rocks, he\r\nwalked along the beach a few steps, and heard the noise more distinctly,\r\nbut in a musical strain. Upon searching round he saw an object lying on\r\na rock a dozen yards from the shore, at which he was somewhat\r\nfrightened. The face and shoulders appeared of human form, and of a\r\nreddish colour; over the shoulders hung long green hair; the tail\r\nresembled that of the seal, but the extremities of the arms he could not\r\nsee distinctly. The creature continued to make a musical noise while he\r\ngazed about two minutes, and on perceiving him it disappeared in an\r\ninstant. Immediately when the man saw his officer, he told this wild\r\ntale, and to add weight to his testimony, (being a Romanist,) he made a\r\ncross on the sand which he kissed, as making oath to the truth of his\r\nstatement. When I saw him, he told the story in so clear and positive a\r\nmanner, making oath to its truth, that I concluded he must really have\r\nseen the animal he described, or that it must have been the effects of a\r\ndisturbed imagination.\"[94]\r\n\r\nThe _green_ hair in this description is the most suspicious element; it\r\nis so exactly that attributed to the poetical mermaids, and so entirely\r\nwithout precedent in the whole range of known zoology,--that, if taken\r\nliterally, I fear it would condemn the narrative. But among the\r\nAntarctic seals, both golden yellow fur, and black fur, are found; and\r\nif hairs of these two colours were about equally intermingled, the\r\nresult would be an olive-green, as we see in some of the monkeys; and\r\nthen some allowance must doubtless be made for imagination, in one\r\nlittle accustomed to precise observation, and \"somewhat frightened\"\r\nwithal. I should say, with little hesitation, that this creature was of\r\nthe seal family, only that the seaman's daily habits brought him into\r\nthe most familiar contact with various kinds of seals; and, unless the\r\nanimal in question had differed notably from such as he was acquainted\r\nwith, he would not have been so affected by the phenomenon. In such\r\nstories, the sorts of creatures familiar to the observation of the\r\nnarrator, and the amount of surprise produced in his mind by the\r\nstranger,--must always be carefully estimated, as important elements in\r\nthe formation of our judgment.\r\n\r\nTo come nearer home, Pontoppidan records the appearance of a merman,\r\nwhich was deposed to on oath by the observers: \"About a mile from the\r\ncoast of Denmark, near Landscrona, three sailors, observing something\r\nlike a dead body floating in the water, rowed towards it. When they came\r\nwithin seven or eight fathoms, it still appeared as at first, for it had\r\nnot stirred; but at that instant it sunk, and came up almost immediately\r\nin the same place. Upon this, out of fear, they lay still, and then let\r\nthe boat float, that they might the better examine the monster, which,\r\nby the help of the current, came nearer and nearer to them. He turned\r\nhis face and stared at them, which gave them a good opportunity of\r\nexamining him narrowly. He stood in the same place for seven or eight\r\nminutes, and was seen above the water breast high. At last they grew\r\napprehensive of some danger, and began to retire; upon which the monster\r\nblew up his cheeks, and made a kind of lowing noise, and then dived from\r\ntheir view. In regard to his form, they declare in their affidavits,\r\nwhich were regularly taken and recorded, that he appeared like an old\r\nman, strong-limbed, with broad shoulders, but his arms they could not\r\nsee. His head was small in proportion to his body, and had short curled\r\nblack hair, which did not reach below his ears; his eyes lay deep in his\r\nhead, and he had a meagre face, with a black beard; about the body\r\ndownwards this merman was quite pointed like a fish.\"[95]\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable story that I know of in recent times, is that\r\nadduced by Dr Robert Hamilton, in his able History of the Whales and\r\nSeals, in the _Naturalist's Library_, he himself vouching for its\r\ngeneral truth, from personal knowledge of some of the parties: \"It was\r\nreported that a fishing-boat, off the island of Yell, one of the\r\nShetland group, had captured a mermaid by its getting entangled in the\r\nlines!! The statement is, that the animal was about three feet long, the\r\nupper part of the body resembling the human, with protuberant mammæ like\r\na woman; the face, the forehead, and neck, were short and resembling\r\nthose of a monkey; the arms, which were small, were kept folded across\r\nthe breast; the fingers were distinct, not webbed; a few stiff long\r\nbristles were on the top of the head, extending down to the shoulders,\r\nand these it could erect and depress at pleasure, something like a\r\ncrest. The inferior part of the body was like a fish. The skin was\r\nsmooth, and of a grey colour. It offered no resistance, nor attempted to\r\nbite, but uttered a low plaintive sound. The crew, six in number, took\r\nit within their boat, but superstition getting the better of curiosity,\r\nthey carefully disentangled it from the lines, and a hook which had\r\naccidentally fastened in its body, and returned it to its native\r\nelement. It instantly dived, descending in a perpendicular direction.\r\n\r\n\"After writing the above, (we are informed) the narrator had an\r\ninterview with the skipper of the boat and one of the crew, from whom he\r\nlearned the following additional particulars. They had the animal for\r\nthree hours within the boat; the body was without scales or hair; was of\r\na silvery grey colour above, and white below, like the human skin; no\r\ngills were observed; nor fins on the back or belly. The tail was like\r\nthat of the dog-fish: the mammæ were about as large as those of a woman;\r\nthe mouth and lips were very distinct, and resembled the human.\r\n\r\n\"This communication was from Mr Edmonston, a well-known and intelligent\r\nobserver, to the distinguished Professor of Natural History in the\r\nEdinburgh University, and Mr E. adds a few reflections, which are so\r\npertinent, that we shall avail ourselves of them. That a very peculiar\r\nanimal has been taken, no one can doubt. It was seen and handled by six\r\nmen, on one occasion, and for some time, not one of whom dreams of a\r\ndoubt of its being a mermaid. If it were supposed that their fears\r\nmagnified its supposed resemblance to the human form, it must at all\r\nevents be admitted that there was some ground for exciting these fears.\r\nBut no such fears were likely to be entertained; for the mermaid is not\r\nan object of terror to the fisherman; it is rather a welcome guest, and\r\ndanger is to be apprehended only from its experiencing bad treatment.\r\nThe usual resources of scepticism, that the seals and other sea-animals,\r\nappearing under certain circumstances, operating on an excited\r\nimagination, and so producing ocular illusion, cannot avail here. It is\r\nquite impossible that, under the circumstances, six Shetland fishermen\r\ncould commit such a mistake.\"[96]\r\n\r\nThere is, no doubt, much in this account which signally distinguishes it\r\nfrom all other statements with which it can be compared, except that of\r\nHudson's sailors, with which it well coincides. The protuberant mammæ,\r\nresembling those of a woman; the human, or at least simian face,\r\nforehead, and neck, and especially the mouth and lips; the distinct\r\nunwebbed fingers; the erectile crest of bristles; the nature of the\r\nsurface,--without scales or hair; the colour; and the tail,--like that\r\nof a fish;--are all very remarkable points; and unless we conclude the\r\nentire story to be a lie, a mere barefaced hoax,--must necessarily\r\nindicate a creature of which scientific zoology knows absolutely\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nIt is observable that, here again, the tail is said to have been piscine\r\nand heterocercal, \"like that of the dog-fish:\" while the naked skin, and\r\nthe colour--silvery grey above and white below,--will well agree with\r\nthe characteristics common to the smaller _Squalidæ_.\r\n\r\nIt is a pity that an account like this, avouched by six witnesses, was\r\nnot thoroughly sifted. I have no doubt that, if a person tolerably\r\nconversant with zoology, and accustomed to the habit of\r\ncross-examination, had examined these six eye-witnesses _separately_,\r\nmaking full notes of what each could remember to have observed, and had\r\nthen checked each deposition by all the others, a mass of testimony\r\nwould have been accumulated that would in an instant have convinced any\r\ncandid inquirer what measure of truth lay in the story. Points in which\r\nthe whole six, or even three or four, agreed, might unhesitatingly have\r\nbeen set down as correct: suggestive questions, (not, however,\r\nsuggesting the sort of answer,) as, \"Had the creature so and so, or so\r\nand so?\" could not have received the same reply from all the deponents,\r\nwithout being worthy of credence: even the points on which they would\r\nhave differed might themselves have been instructive to an intelligent\r\ninquirer. I do not know that any such precautionary measures were\r\nresorted to in this case, and the tale must remain as we get it; but I\r\nmake these observations for the purpose of suggesting, in the event of\r\nany similar occurrence, the advantage of _separate_ examination in\r\ngetting at the truth. On a review of the whole evidence, I do not judge\r\nthat this single story is a sufficient foundation for believing in the\r\nexistence of mermaids; but, taken into combination with other\r\nstatements, it induces a strong suspicion that the northern seas may\r\nhold forms of life as yet uncatalogued by science.\r\n\r\n[87] _Geog. and Classif. of Animals_, 249.\r\n\r\n[88] _Egypt and Mehemet Ali_, ii. p. 322.\r\n\r\n[89] _Japan and her People_, p. 193.\r\n\r\n[90] See Hibbert's _Shetland Islands_, p. 566.\r\n\r\n[91] Miss Sinclair's _Shetland_.\r\n\r\n[92] Notes to _The Lord of the Isles_.\r\n\r\n[93] _Hudson the Navigator_, by Asher, Voy. ii.\r\n\r\n[94] _Voyage towards the South Pole_, p. 143.\r\n\r\n[95] Pontoppidan's _Nat.

That insuperable difficulties stand _a priori_ in the way of our\r\nbelieving in such conditions, no one familiar with animal physiology can\r\ndeny; for, as Mr Bell observes, to believe that a Toad inclosed within a\r\nmass of clay, or other similar substance, shall exist wholly without air\r\nor food, for hundreds of years, and at length be liberated alive and\r\ncapable of crawling, on the breaking up of the matrix,--now become a\r\nsolid rock,--is certainly a demand upon our credulity which few will be\r\nready to answer.\r\n\r\nYet, after all, it is a question that must not be decided _a priori_: it\r\nmust rest upon evidence. It may be that here, too, fact is stranger than\r\nfiction; and we must not shut our eyes and ears to concurrent credible\r\ntestimony, if it happen to bear witness to facts which we cannot account\r\nfor. Truth will certainly be upon us, even though, ostrich-like, we\r\nthrust our head into a bush, and maintain that we cannot see it.\r\n\r\nThe learned historian of British Reptiles speaks with his characteristic\r\ncandour upon the point. He admits that the many concurrent assertions of\r\ncredible persons, who declare themselves to have been witnesses of the\r\nemancipation of imprisoned Toads, forbid us hastily to refuse our\r\nassent, or at least to deny the possibility of such a circumstance;\r\nwhile he demands better and more cautious evidence to authorise our\r\nimplicit faith in these asserted facts.[97]\r\n\r\nThe ordinary mode of accounting for the phenomena, supposing them to be\r\nnarrated in good faith, is that the animal \"fell into the hollow where\r\nthe men were at work, and was taken up by them in ignorance of the mode\r\nin which it had come there,\" or that \"it may have hidden in the hollow\r\nof a tree during the autumn and winter, and on the return of spring\r\nfound itself so far inclosed within its hiding-place as to be unable to\r\nescape.\" This latter suggestion would be more worthy of attention were\r\nthe winter season the period in which, in our climate, periodical\r\nadditions are made to the living wood, so as to narrow the entrance, or\r\nin which augmentations of bulk occurred to Toads, so as to prevent them\r\nfrom getting out where they got in;--but unfortunately the reverse of\r\nboth suppositions is true. As to the former suggestion, while it may\r\npossibly serve to dismiss a few of the published statements, there are\r\nothers which it would be absurd to explain thereby.\r\n\r\nTrue to its principles of never shutting the door to the investigation\r\nof any natural history subject, the _Zoologist_ has, during the eighteen\r\nyears of its existence, been a medium for collecting and preserving\r\nfacts bearing on this question. The pages of this periodical form an\r\ninvaluable storehouse to the philosophic naturalist, who wishes to\r\npursue his science undeterred by the ridicule of sciolism or the frown\r\nof authority. Let us search its treasures, then, expecting to find\r\nstories of diverse grades of credibility, of which the editor wisely\r\nleaves his readers to judge for themselves.\r\n\r\nIn May 1844, the Rev. J. Pemberton Bartlett of Kingston, in Kent, an\r\nexperienced naturalist, mentions the following fact as having just come\r\nunder his own notice:--\"Only a few weeks since, in cutting down a\r\nfir-tree here, the workman discovered, completely imbedded in the\r\ncentre, a Toad, which had doubtless been there some years, as the tree\r\nhad completely grown over it; it must have been kept alive by absorbing\r\nthe moisture of the tree. It was not in a completely torpid state, and\r\nafter being exposed to the air a few hours, it crawled in true toad-like\r\nstyle. The age of the tree in which it was found was, as far as I could\r\njudge from the number of circles, about twenty-five years.\"[98]\r\n\r\nIn reply to an inquiry whether he himself saw the Toad, and counted the\r\ntimber-rings, Mr Bartlett favours me with the following note:--\r\n\r\n                              \"EXBURY PARSONAGE, NEAR SOUTHAMPTON,\r\n                                    _February 22, 1861_.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,-- ... _I_ quite believe that Toads _do_ live in stone, but I\r\nhave found it very difficult to get the facts from eye-witnesses. The\r\nimbedded Toad in the fir-tree, mentioned by me in the _Zoologist_, I\r\nsaw, and, as stated there, I counted the rings of the tree. I believe it\r\nto have been the common Toad; but it looked rather more flabby, and not\r\nquite so round in its proportions, as toads generally do; in fact,\r\ninstead of being 'puffed up' as they commonly are, it was considerably\r\n_down in the mouth_, from its close imprisonment! The cavity in which it\r\nwas fixed appeared to have been originally a crack or fissure in the\r\nside of the tree; whether caused by decay, or made by a nuthatch or some\r\nother bird, I cannot say. The wound appeared to have healed, as the bark\r\nhad apparently closed over it. The question now arises, Was the Toad\r\n_young_ when it got into the hollow? and did it grow after it became a\r\nprisoner? Or had it come to years of discretion, when it took that\r\nunfortunate step, or rather crawl, into the cavity where it was so long\r\nto be imprisoned? And _why did_ it remain there so quietly, while the\r\nbark gradually grew over its prison-house? The answer that I should\r\ngive to the first of these questions would be, that probably it had\r\narrived at a state of _toadhood_ when it took refuge in the tree, and\r\n_did not_ grow afterwards. My theory why it remained ensconced there so\r\nquietly is this, that probably it might have been accustomed for some\r\ntime to take refuge by day in this hole, from whence it would set out on\r\nits nocturnal rambles, and probably 'not go home till morning;' that on\r\nsome occasion, 'when daylight did appear,' it returned to its accustomed\r\nhaunt, and there squatted, winking and puffing, after its night's\r\nexploits, as toads are wont to do; that, on that luckless day, some\r\nfelled tree or trees were laid up against the fir-tree that contained\r\nits abode, and that the tree or trees remained there till the bark\r\nclosed so as to prevent its escape. What makes this idea the more\r\nprobable is that the place where the fir-tree grew had, for probably\r\nyears, been used as a place to store felled timber, as it was used for\r\nthat purpose at the time I saw the Toad.\r\n\r\n\"After the discovery of this Toad in the fir-tree, I tried several\r\nexperiments on Toads, by burying them in closely-sealed flower-pots, at\r\na depth of nearly three feet. I much regret that I cannot find my notes\r\non the subject; but I remember perfectly the main facts of one. The Toad\r\nwas placed in a flower-pot, with another turned over it, and well\r\ncemented together--the two holes in both pots being also closely\r\ncemented up. It was buried between two and three feet deep in the\r\ngarden. At the end of three months I took it up, and weighed the Toad,\r\nand found it had lost a very little in weight. This I did again at the\r\nend of three months more; it was then quite lively, and had lost again\r\nbut little in weight. I replaced it as before, and on taking it up the\r\nthird time, I found the pots had, probably the cement not having been\r\ndry when buried, slipped on one side, and the moisture had got in, and\r\nconsequently the poor Toad was dead, as well as buried! Now, surely if a\r\nToad could live _six months_ hermetically _sealed_ in a flower-pot,\r\nwithout air or food--why not a much longer time?...--Believe me, yours\r\nfaithfully,\r\n\r\n                                        \"J. PEMBERTON BARTLETT.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. W. J. Bree of Allesley, also an excellent zoologist, alluding\r\nto some queries by Mr E. Newman, communicated the following facts:--\"I\r\nquite agree with you that the statements about Toads found in solid\r\nstone are mostly very unsatisfactory. One instance of the kind I have\r\nseen, as briefly stated, _Mag. Nat. Hist._, ix. 316. The Toad appeared\r\nto me neither more nor less than our common species, although I\r\ncertainly did not examine it scientifically. The stone was the new red\r\nsandstone of geologists; and was brought up, as I was told, some yards\r\nfrom below the surface. I understood the Toad, and the two portions of\r\nstone in which it was found inclosed, were deposited in some medical\r\nmuseum at Birmingham. The animal would not have been discovered but for\r\nan accident: the workmen were carting the stone away, and the block\r\ncontaining the Toad happened to be placed on the top of a great load,\r\nand accidentally fell from the cart to the ground, and, breaking by the\r\nfall, brought to light the incarcerated reptile, which, I conclude, was\r\nsomewhat injured by the fall, as there was a fresh wound on one side of\r\nthe head, and it appeared to be blind of one eye. The Toad died, I was\r\ninformed, the second day after it was discovered, partly, in all\r\nprobability, in consequence of the injury. When I say the block of stone\r\nwas _solid_, this statement requires some qualification: the two parts\r\nof the stone fitted together exactly, and quite close, except where the\r\ncavity was in which the Toad lay; but from this cavity there was\r\nevidently a flaw on one side towards the extremity, and a discolouring\r\nof the substance of the sandstone, so that although the two portions\r\nfitted together, they might not have been (on one side of the cavity)\r\nvery firmly united. This circumstance, perhaps, may detract from the\r\nvalue of the example; nevertheless, it is unaccountable how the animal\r\ncould have got into the position in which it was found: it is not\r\nconceivable, I think, that it should have been there ever since the\r\nfirst formation of the rock, and there certainly appeared to be no means\r\nby which it could have entered the rock in its present state, even\r\nadmitting (what we know to be the fact) that Toads have the power of\r\ngetting in and out of a very small orifice.\"\r\n\r\nThe author of the next account, signed \"E. Peacock,\" is unknown to me;\r\nand it does not appear whether he speaks from personal observation or\r\nnot. He says, \"A few days ago, two labourers, employed at a stone quarry\r\nat Frodingham, near Brigg, Lincolnshire, found, at a depth of five feet\r\nbelow the surface of the ground, and between two blocks of stone (lias),\r\na living Toad: the interstice between the stones was filled with yellow\r\nclay, and there did not appear the least possible aperture by which\r\nanything could have passed.\"[99]\r\n\r\nEven from remote India we have reports of the same phenomenon. A\r\ncorrespondent from Serampore sends the _Zoologist_ the following:--\"Last\r\nWednesday, Feb. 7, 1849, on severing the branch of a tree, apparently of\r\nthe tamarind species, I found a Toad in the centre of the wood, entirely\r\nexcluded from light and air. The appearance of the animal was rather\r\nextraordinary. The body seemed full of air, and the skin soft and puffy,\r\nand of a light yellowish colour, with the exception of the extremities\r\nof the feet, which were hard and dark. The creature when exposed to the\r\nair seemed rather uncomfortable, and drew in its head just like a turtle\r\nwhen alarmed. It was thrown into a tank, when the water around, to the\r\nspace of about a foot on either side, became perfectly white, like milk.\r\nIt jumped out of the water immediately, apparently not liking the\r\ncoldness. I did not have opportunity of observing it further, which I\r\nregret, as the animal got concealed in the long grass on the side of the\r\ntank, and was thus lost. The general supposition as to the mode by which\r\nanimals get inclosed within trees, is their taking shelter in the cavity\r\nof a tree when very young, and the growth of the tree filling up the\r\ncavity, and thus imprisoning the animal. But this supposition, if true\r\nin the present case, makes the circumstance now related the more\r\nextraordinary. The tree is an old one, upwards of fifty feet high, and\r\nhaving a trunk more than three feet in diameter; and the height from the\r\nground at which the Toad was found was about twelve feet. We must\r\nsuppose the Toad to have got into the tree when within a foot from the\r\nground: how many years old then must the animal be?\"\r\n\r\nThe mention of the whitening of the water in which the Toad was immersed\r\nis to my mind a strong corroboration of the veracity of the preceding\r\nnarrative. It is not a circumstance at all likely to occur to a mere\r\ninventor, as it does not in the least bear on the question of\r\nincarceration, and there is no attempt to explain it. I have\r\noccasionally seen fluids rendered partially opaque by the outflow of a\r\nmilky secretion from animals immersed in them, as in the case of the\r\ncurious _Peripatus_ of Jamaica, which, when put alive into spirits,\r\ndischarges a considerable quantity of white fluid, which diffuses in the\r\nalcohol. The Toad was probably distinct from our common English species,\r\nbut we know that the latter secretes a yellow acrid fluid in some\r\nabundance in the follicles of its skin, and this might be poured out\r\nunder the excitement of alarm or anger.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1851, the Académie des Sciences was interested\r\n(according to the public papers) with this question. In digging a well\r\nat Blois, in June of that year, \"some workmen drew up from about a yard\r\nbeneath the surface a large flint, weighing about fourteen pounds, and\r\non striking it a blow with a pickaxe, it split in two, and discovered,\r\nsnugly ensconced in the very centre, a large Toad. The Toad seemed for a\r\nmoment greatly astonished, but jumped out, and rather rapidly crawled\r\naway. He was seized and replaced in the hole, when he settled himself\r\ndown very quietly. The stone and Toad, just as they were, were sent to\r\nthe Society of Sciences at Blois, and became immediately the subject of\r\ncurious attention. First of all, the flint, fitted together, with the\r\nToad in the hole, was placed in a cellar, and imbedded in moss. There it\r\nwas left for some time. It is not known if the Toad ate, but it is\r\ncertain that he made no discharge of any kind. It was found that if the\r\ntop of the stone were cautiously removed in a dark place he did not\r\nstir, but that if the removal were effected in the light, he immediately\r\ngot out and ran away. If he were placed on the edge of the flint, he\r\nwould crawl into his hole, and fix himself comfortably in. He gathered\r\nhis legs beneath his body; and it was observed that he took especial\r\ncare of one of his feet, which had been slightly hurt in one of his\r\nremovals. The hole is not one bit larger than the body, except a little\r\nwhere the back is. There is a sort of ledge on which his mouth reposes,\r\nand the bones of the jaws are slightly indented, as if from long resting\r\non a hard substance. Not the slightest appearance of any communication\r\nwhatsoever between the centre and the outside of the stone can be\r\ndiscovered, so that there is no reason to suppose that he could have\r\ndrawn any nourishment from the outside. The committee, consisting of\r\nthree eminent naturalists, one of whom has made Toads his peculiar\r\nstudy for years, made no secret of their belief that the Toad had been\r\nin that stone for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years; but how he could\r\nhave lived without air, or food, or water, or movement, they made no\r\nattempt to explain. They accordingly contented themselves with proposing\r\nthat the present should be considered another authentic case, to be\r\nadded to the few hundreds already existing, of Toads being found alive\r\nimbedded in stone, leaving it to some future savant to explain what now\r\nappears the wonderful miracle by which Nature keeps them alive so long\r\nin such places. But the distinguished M. Majendie suggested that it was\r\njust possible that an attempt was being made to hoax the Academy, by\r\nmaking it believe that the Toad had been found in the hole, whereas it\r\nmight only have been put in by the mischievous workmen after the stone\r\nwas broken. Terrified at the idea of becoming the laughing-stock of the\r\npublic, the Academy declined to take any formal resolution about the\r\nToad, but thanked the committee for its very interesting communication;\r\nand so the subject dropped.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement does not, to be sure, bear about it that character of\r\nprecision which should mark the report of a scientific body, nor is it\r\nverified by authority; but the terror ascribed to L'Académie at the idea\r\nof being hoaxed, and the instant quashing of the inquiry, are so true to\r\nnature, so accurately characteristic of our august associations of\r\nsavans, that I cannot help believing the story.\r\n\r\nHere is another, which has the air of a _bonâ fide_ account, though I\r\nhave no knowledge of the writer, nor does he himself seem to pretend to\r\npersonal autopsy of the discovery.\r\n\r\nOn Monday last, September 20, while some workmen were engaged in getting\r\niron ore at a place called Paswick, in the north of this county,\r\n[Derby,] they came upon a solid lump of ore, which, being heavier than\r\ntwo men could lift, they set to work to break with their picks, when, to\r\ntheir surprise, in a cavity near the centre of the stone, they found a\r\nToad alive. The cavity was much larger than the Toad, being nearly six\r\ninches in diameter, and was lined with crystals of what I suppose to be\r\ncarbonate of lime. The stone was about four yards from the surface of\r\nthe ground; it is now in the possession of Mr Haywood of Derby, by whose\r\nmen it was found; but unfortunately the Toad was not preserved after its\r\ndeath, which took place almost immediately on its exposure to the\r\natmosphere.[100]\r\n\r\n_Audi alteram partem._ Mr Plant of the Salford Museum tells us, both in\r\nsorrow and in anger, a story, doubtless more amusing to us who read it\r\nthan to him, of his adventures among the toad-finders. When geologising\r\nin the neighbourhood of Chesterfield, a quarryman, whom he had invited\r\nto share a bottle of porter, informed him in confidence that Toads\r\ninclosed in stone were plentiful thereabout. \"He said he had often found\r\nthem, and that he knew a stone before it was broken that would contain a\r\nToad; giving me long and circumstantial accounts of the whole\r\nphenomenon: and, to convince me of the truth of his statement, he took\r\nme to the quarry (a carboniferous sandstone) that I might see the stones\r\nout of which he said the Toads had been released. I examined the stones\r\nand the whole quarry very attentively, and listened to the emphatic\r\ntestimony of other miners present. After complying in an agreeable\r\nmanner to their remark that the day was warm, and the water of the\r\nquarry not much in favour, I made a simple proposal of this nature:--I\r\npromised to pay to any one of them the sum of twenty shillings for the\r\nnext stone in which they found a Frog or Toad when the stone was broken\r\nin two. They should catch the Frog if he bolted out of the hole, replace\r\nhim, and fit the stones together again, afterwards despatching it to me\r\nin that condition. I further promised to pay the sum of forty shillings\r\nto any one of them who should procure me a stone, unbroken, in which he\r\nconsidered a Toad or Frog was imprisoned, if, on breaking it myself,\r\nsuch turned out to be the case. These conditions were to remain in force\r\nfor twelve months; and as the means of conveyance to my address, which I\r\ngave them, would occasion little or no trouble, the offer was readily\r\naccepted by the miners; who also, to express their confidence in soon\r\nbeing able to supply the order, proposed that it would be all safe if I\r\nadvanced a little cash on account; which however I resolutely declined\r\ndoing. And now what will the credulous believers in these 'Toads in\r\nstone' who read the _Zoologist_ say, when they learn that I visited the\r\nquarry twice during the twelve months, in order to fetch the Toads\r\nwhich never came by rail? I always found the men there blasting tons of\r\nnew rock, splitting stones for every building purpose, yet dry-throated\r\nand sullen; for, alas! most unaccountably during that long twelve months\r\nthey found plenty of holes--not Toad holes--in the sandstone, but the\r\nreptiles had been banished as effectually as ever they were from the\r\nEmerald Isle.\"[101]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOAD IN A HOLE.]\r\n\r\nThis was disheartening, certainly: and we do not wonder that Mr Plant\r\nbecame \"a total disbeliever in these 'simple tales.'\" Still, it is just\r\npossible, that immured Toads may exist, though Mikey of the Chesterfield\r\nquarry, in hope of the advance, did brag a little too confidently of the\r\ncommonness of the occurrence. That, within one twelvemonth, within the\r\nlimits of one quarry, no such Toad turned up, even under the stimulus of\r\nthe proffered forty shillings, can scarcely be admitted to be absolutely\r\nconclusive proof of the negative, at least not to us who were not placed\r\nin the painful position of _gullees_. Mr Arthur Hussey of Rottingdean\r\njustly remarks, when presenting some evidence _per contra_, that we\r\nshould not think the innocence of a culprit was established by his\r\nasserting, when sundry witnesses affirmed they saw him commit the\r\noffence he was accused of,--that he could produce ten times the number\r\nwho would swear they _did not_ see him.\r\n\r\n\"During the summer of 1846,\" writes Mr Hussey, \"in the formation of a\r\nrailroad, about half a mile from Pontefract, in Yorkshire, the works\r\nwere carried a 'depth of four feet through a rock betwixt lime and\r\nsandstone, about the junction of the two formations:' the rock being so\r\nfirm as to require blasting. 'It is entirely free from beds of any kind,\r\nor what the workmen term \"backs,\" running up it,' but therein are 'an\r\ninfinite number of small nodules of a harder quality, entirely\r\ncrystallised in the interior.' After blasting, the labourers were much\r\nsurprised to find among the fragments several of these nodules, each one\r\ncontaining a Frog, as many as seven having been counted after one\r\n'shot.'\r\n\r\n\"These were not casually seen when exposed, and then disregarded, but\r\nwere examined in their stone prisons through very minute holes, some\r\neven preserved in that state for a long period. For example, the relator\r\nstates of one specimen, 'I kept this Toad in a cellar for about five\r\nmonths, during which time it ate nothing, and was without light, the\r\nhole in the stone being covered with a piece of clay, and the whole kept\r\nmoist and cool with water.' Of another he says, 'The Frog lived only\r\nabout a week, as I kept it in a place which I think was too warm for it,\r\nand also not sufficiently dark and quiet. When the Frogs were disturbed\r\nby the shots, their first desire seemed to be to get under shelter of\r\nsome stone, or into their old holes again, shewing thereby that sight\r\nwas not wanting, and bodily activity was perfect as far as could be\r\nseen. One thing struck me as singular with regard to the Frog I\r\nkept--its fresh, plump, and healthy appearance, its skin being soft and\r\ntransparent. One day, when I was holding my finger over the hole in the\r\nstone, it pushed its head between my finger and the sides of the hole,\r\nand drew its whole body after it on to the table, where it appeared more\r\nlike a skeleton than any living animal I have ever seen, but by degrees\r\nit extended itself to its former dimensions.'\r\n\r\n\"Of the above curious occurrence my only knowledge is derived from the\r\naccount written to a distant friend, of which the substance has now been\r\nextracted. The writer is an utter stranger, but he was officially\r\nemployed in the operations which resulted in the discoveries; and my\r\ninformation leads me to believe his report deserving of confidence, for\r\nwhich reason I have not hesitated to offer this abstract for publication\r\nin the _Zoologist_.\"[102]\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Alfred Charles Smith, an excellent and genial naturalist,\r\nfavours us with another case, introducing it incidentally in\r\nillustration of the general habit he is denouncing of wantonly\r\ndestroying animal life:--\"As an instance of this thoughtless cruelty, I\r\nmust give an account that has just come to my notice. Some labourers\r\nwere pulling down an old wall, in the thickness of which they found one\r\nof those phenomena--so frequently heard of and so unsatisfactorily\r\naccounted for--a Toad completely imbedded in stone and mortar. 'There\r\nwas no doubt,' said the labourer who described it, 'that he had been\r\nthere for a great number of years, for there was no hole or chink by\r\nwhich he could have entered or left the place of his long sojourn.'\r\n'Well,' said the listener to his account, 'but are you sure that the\r\nToad was alive when you found it?' 'No doubt of that, sir,' said the\r\nman, 'for he crawled out of his round hole and was moving away, when I\r\nknocked him on the head with my pickaxe.'\r\n\r\n\"So here was this poor harmless creature, whose long incarceration in\r\nhis gloomy dungeon might have excited compassion in his favour, suddenly\r\nreleased from his prison, only to be slain by his liberator!\"[103]\r\n\r\nThe next is from the _Caledonian Mercury_. Newspaper zoology is\r\nproverbially untrustworthy, and the editor of the _Zoologist_, who\r\nreprints the paragraph, kindly adds a caveat for the benefit of his\r\nreaders,--\"_Nimium ne crede Mercurio!_\" But, nevertheless, let us look\r\nat it: alone it would stand for little, but, remember, in such questions\r\nas this the evidence is cumulative. \"There is at present to be seen at\r\nMessrs Sanderson and Sons, George Street, Edinburgh, an extraordinary\r\nspecimen of natural history--a Frog which had been discovered alive in\r\nfreestone rock. A few months ago, while some colliers in the employ of\r\nMr James Nasmyth (lessee of Dundonald Colliery, in Fife, the property of\r\nR. B. Wardlaw Ramsay, Esq. of Whitehill), were engaged in taking out the\r\npavement of the seam coal, which was freestone, they discovered a cavity\r\nin which a Frog was lying. On touching it the Frog jumped about for some\r\ntime, and a bucket of water being procured, it was put into it, and\r\ntaken to the surface. On reaching it, the animal was found to be dead.\r\nIt was at the depth of forty-five fathoms, or ninety yards from the\r\nsurface, in a perpendicular line of strata, consisting of alternate\r\nlayers of coal and freestone, with ironstone, and about four hundred\r\nyards from the outcrop surface. The Frog seems to have much of the same\r\ncharacter as the present species. It is very attenuated, which cannot be\r\nwondered at, considering its domicile for so many ages, its original\r\nexistence being of course considered contemporaneous with the formation\r\nof the freestone rock in which it was contained.\"[104]\r\n\r\nNow, again, we get the statement of a careful working naturalist, Mr\r\nThomas Clark of Halesleigh. He cannot, indeed, give personal authority\r\nfor what he records; but the confidence of such a man in his informant\r\nis an element not without its value. \"March 25, 1859. In the early part\r\nof this month, two live Toads were dug out from the bottom of a bed of\r\nstiff brick clay, in the neighbourhood of Bridgewater, at the depth of\r\nfourteen feet from the surface of the ground; a third was killed by the\r\nspade before they were observed. This bed of clay rests on peat, and the\r\nToads were found at the junction of the two beds, in a small domed\r\ncavity, about the size of the crown of a man's hat. On being exposed to\r\nthe air, they uttered a squeaking cry, resembling that of a rat, but in\r\nabout a minute they seemed reconciled to their new destiny, and moved\r\nfreely about. They were kept in a jar for a few days, and then placed at\r\nliberty in a garden, where I suppose they are still living. The living\r\nones were about two inches in length, but narrow in proportion, and of\r\na rather lighter colour than Toads usually are; the one which was killed\r\nwas very much larger. The clay under which they were buried had been\r\ngradually dug out from the surface since about the beginning of the\r\nyear, but the last five feet of depth was not dug till the day on which\r\nthey were discovered. After about two feet of the surface, the clay is\r\nvery close and adhesive, and far too moist to admit of cracks being\r\nformed in it, even in the driest summers.\"[105]\r\n\r\nTo this communication inserted in the _Zoologist_, Mr Newman added a\r\nnote asking the name of any scientific man who was present at the\r\nexhumation. Mr Clark replies:--\"I am unable to give such a name, further\r\nthan as the intelligent foreman of the brickyard, Thomas Duddridge, (who\r\nwitnessed the exhumation by one of the labourers of the yard,) may be\r\nentitled to the appellation; but no one, however high his scientific\r\nattainments, could be more careful than he was to give me correct\r\ninformation, or more exact in his statements; and if, after minute\r\ninquiry, I had not been fully satisfied of the correctness of his\r\naccount, I should not have sought to occupy the pages of the _Zoologist_\r\nwith its recital. On shewing him the notice in the _Zoologist_, he said\r\nit was impossible for anything to be more correct; and he added, that\r\nthe little cavity which the Toads occupied was quite smooth in every\r\npart, apparently by their long-continued movements,--as smooth, to use\r\nhis own illustration, as the inside of a China bowl.\"[106]\r\n\r\nNumerous experiments have been made with a view to test the possibility\r\nof these reputed facts. If Toads do so commonly become voluntarily or\r\naccidentally immured, and remain without light, food, or even air, for\r\nmany years, and yet survive, let us put some Toads into similar\r\ncircumstances, keep them shut up, and, after the lapse of a sufficient\r\ninterval, examine them, and see whether they are alive or dead.\r\n\"_Experimentum faciemus in corpore vili_,\" as the village doctor said to\r\nhis assistant over the sick traveller.\r\n\r\n_Probatum est!_ Besides the case mentioned in Mr Bartlett's letter\r\n(_ante_, p. 149), the late Dr Buckland, in November 1825, instituted a\r\nseries of careful experiments, which are thus narrated by himself:--\"In\r\none large block of coarse oolitic limestone, twelve circular cells were\r\nprepared, each about one foot deep and five inches in diameter, and\r\nhaving a groove or shoulder at its upper margin fitted to receive a\r\ncircular plate of glass, and a circular slate to protect the glass: the\r\nmargin of this double cover was closed round and rendered impenetrable\r\nto air and water by a luting of soft clay. Twelve smaller cells, each\r\nsix inches deep and five inches in diameter, were made in another block\r\nof compact siliceous sandstone, viz., the Pennant Grit of the coal\r\nformation near Bristol; these cells also were covered with similar\r\nplates of glass and slate, cemented at the edge by clay. The object of\r\nthe glass covers was to allow the animals to be inspected, without\r\ndisturbing the clay so as to admit external air or insects into the\r\ncell. The limestone is so porous that it is easily permeable by water,\r\nand probably also by air; the sandstone is very compact.\r\n\r\n\"On the 26th of November 1825, one live Toad was placed in each of the\r\nabove-mentioned twenty-four cells, and the double cover of glass and\r\nslate placed over each of them, and cemented down by the luting of clay.\r\nThe weight of each Toad in grains was ascertained and noted by Dr\r\nDaubeny and Mr Dillwyn at the time of their being placed in the cells;\r\nthat of the smallest was 115 grains, and of the largest 1185 grains. The\r\nlarge and small animals were distributed in equal proportion between the\r\nlimestone and sandstone cells.\r\n\r\n\"These blocks of stone were buried together in my garden beneath three\r\nfeet of earth, and remained unopened until the 10th of December 1826, on\r\nwhich day they were examined. Every Toad in the smaller cells of the\r\ncompact sandstone was dead, and the bodies of most of them so much\r\ndecayed that they must have been dead some months. The greater number of\r\nthose in the larger cells of porous limestone were alive. No. 1, whose\r\nweight when immured was 924 grains, now weighed only 698 grains. No. 5,\r\nwhose weight when immured was 1185 grains, now weighed 1265 grains. The\r\nglass cover over this cell was slightly cracked, so that minute insects\r\nmight have entered: none, however, were discovered in this cell; but in\r\nanother cell whose glass was broken, and the animal within it dead,\r\nthere was a large assemblage of minute insects; and a similar assemblage\r\nalso on the outside of the glass of a third cell. In cell No. 9, a Toad\r\nwhich when put in weighed 988 grains, had increased to 1116 grains, and\r\nthe glass cover over it was entire; but as the luting of the cell within\r\nwhich this Toad had increased in weight was not particularly examined,\r\nit is probable there was some aperture in it by which small insects\r\nfound admission. No. 11 had decreased from 936 grains to 652 grains.\r\n\r\n\"When they were first examined in December 1826, not only were all the\r\nsmall Toads dead, but the larger ones appeared much emaciated, with the\r\ntwo exceptions above mentioned; we have already stated that these\r\nprobably owed their increased weight to the insects which had found\r\naccess to the cells, and become their food.\r\n\r\n\"The death of every individual of every size in the smaller cells of\r\ncompact sandstone, appears to have resulted from a deficiency in the\r\nsupply of air, in consequence of the smallness of the cells, and the\r\nimpermeable nature of the stone; the larger volume of air originally\r\ninclosed in the cells of the limestone, and the porous nature of the\r\nstone itself, (permeable as it is slowly by water, and probably by air,)\r\nseem to have favoured the duration of life to the animals inclosed in\r\nthem without food.\r\n\r\n\"It should be noticed that there is a defect in these experiments,\r\narising from the treatment of the twenty-four Toads before they were\r\ninclosed in the blocks of stone. They were shut up and buried on the\r\n26th of November, but the greater number of them had been caught more\r\nthan two months before that time, and had been imprisoned all together\r\nin a cucumber frame placed on common garden earth, where the supply of\r\nfood to so many individuals was probably scanty, and their confinement\r\nunnatural, so that they were in an unhealthy and somewhat meagre state\r\nat the time of their imprisonment. We can therefore scarcely argue with\r\ncertainty from the death of all these individuals within two years, as\r\nto the duration of life which might have been maintained had they\r\nretired spontaneously, and fallen into the torpor of their natural\r\nhibernation in good bodily condition.\r\n\r\n\"The results of our experiments amount to this: all the Toads, both\r\nlarge and small, inclosed in sandstone, and the small Toads in the\r\nlimestone also, were dead at the end of thirteen months. Before the\r\nexpiration of the second year all the large ones also were dead; these\r\nwere examined several times during the second year through the glass\r\ncovers of the cells, but without removing them to admit air; they\r\nappeared always awake, with their eyes open, and never in a state of\r\ntorpor, their meagreness increasing at each interval in which they were\r\nexamined, until at length they were found dead; those two also which had\r\ngained an accession of weight at the end of the first year, and were\r\nthen carefully closed up again, were emaciated and dead before the\r\nexpiration of the second year.\r\n\r\n\"At the same time that these Toads were inclosed in stone, four other\r\nToads of middling size were inclosed in three holes, cut for this\r\npurpose on the north side of the trunk of an apple-tree; two being\r\nplaced in the largest cell, and each of the others in a single cell.\r\nThe cells were nearly circular, about five inches deep and three inches\r\nin diameter; they were carefully closed up with a plug of wood, so as to\r\nexclude access of insects, and apparently were air-tight; when examined\r\nat the end of a year, every one of the Toads was dead, and their bodies\r\nwere decayed.\r\n\r\n\"From the fatal result of the experiments made in the small cells cut in\r\nthe apple-tree and the block of compact sandstone, it seems to follow\r\nthat Toads cannot live a year excluded totally from atmospheric air;\r\nand, from the experiments in the larger cells within the block of\r\noolitic limestone, it seems also probable that they cannot survive two\r\nyears entirely excluded from food; we may therefore conclude that there\r\nis a want of sufficiently minute and accurate observation in those so\r\nfrequently recorded cases, where Toads are said to be found alive within\r\nblocks of stone and wood, in cavities that had no communication whatever\r\nwith the external air. The fact of my two Toads having increased in\r\nweight at the end of the year, notwithstanding the care that was taken\r\nto inclose them perfectly by a luting of clay, shews how very small an\r\naperture will admit of insects sufficient to maintain life. In the cell\r\nNo. 5, where the glass was slightly cracked, the communication though\r\nsmall was obvious, but in the cell No. 9, where the glass cover remained\r\nentire, and where it appears certain, from the increased weight of the\r\ninclosed animal, that insects must have found admission, we have an\r\nexample of these minute animals finding their way into a cell to which\r\ngreat care had been taken to prevent any possibility of access.\r\n\r\n\"Admitting, then, that Toads are occasionally found in cavities of wood\r\nand stone with which there is no communication sufficiently large to\r\nallow the ingress and egress of the animal inclosed in them, we may, I\r\nthink, find a solution of such phenomena in the habits of these\r\nreptiles, and of the insects which form their food. The first effort of\r\nthe young Toad, as soon as it has left its tadpole state and emerged\r\nfrom the water, is to seek shelter in holes and crevices of rocks and\r\ntrees. An individual which, when young, may have thus entered a cavity\r\nby some very narrow aperture, would find abundance of food by catching\r\ninsects, which, like itself, seek shelter within such cavities; and may\r\nsoon have increased so much in bulk as to render it impossible to get\r\nout again through the narrow aperture at which it entered. A small hole\r\nof this kind is very likely to be overlooked by common workmen, who are\r\nthe only people whose operations on stone and wood disclose cavities in\r\nthe interior of such substances.\r\n\r\n\"In the case of Toads, Snakes, and Lizards, that occasionally issue from\r\nstones that are broken in a quarry, or in sinking wells, and sometimes\r\neven from strata of coal at the bottom of a coal-mine, the evidence is\r\nnever perfect to shew that the reptiles were entirely inclosed in solid\r\nrock. No examination is ever made until the reptile is first discovered\r\nby the breaking of the mass in which it was contained, and then it is\r\ntoo late to ascertain, without carefully replacing every fragment, (and\r\nin no case that I have seen reported has this ever been done,) whether\r\nor not there was any hole or crevice by which the animal may have\r\nentered the cavity from which it was extracted. Without previous\r\nexamination it is almost impossible to prove that there was no such\r\ncommunication. In the case of rocks near the surface of the earth, and\r\nin stone quarries, reptiles find ready admission to holes and fissures.\r\nWe have a notorious example of this kind in the Lizard found in a\r\nchalk-pit, and brought alive to the late Dr Clark. In the case also of\r\nwells and coal-pits, a reptile that had fallen down the well or shaft,\r\nand survived its fall, would seek its natural retreat in the first hole\r\nor crevice it could find, and the miner dislodging it from this cavity,\r\nto which his previous attention had not been called, might in ignorance\r\nconclude that the animal was coeval with the stone from which he had\r\nextracted it.\r\n\r\n\"It remains only to consider the case (of which I know not any\r\nauthenticated example) of Toads that have been said to be found in\r\ncavities within blocks of limestone, to which, on careful examination,\r\nno access whatever could be discovered, and where the animal was\r\nabsolutely and entirely closed up with stone. Should any such case ever\r\nhave existed, it is probable that the communication between this cavity\r\nand the external surface had been closed up by stalactitic incrustation,\r\nafter the animal had become too large to make its escape. A similar\r\nexplanation may be offered of the much more probable case of a live Toad\r\nbeing entirely surrounded with solid wood. In each case, the animal\r\nwould have continued to increase in bulk so long as the smallest\r\naperture remained by which air and insects could find admission; it\r\nwould probably become torpid as soon as this aperture was entirely\r\nclosed by the accumulation of stalactite or the growth of wood. But it\r\nstill remains to be ascertained how long this state of torpor may\r\ncontinue under total exclusion from food and from external air: and,\r\nalthough the experiments above recorded shew that life did not extend\r\ntwo years in the case of any one of the individuals which formed the\r\nsubjects of them, yet, for reasons which have been specified, they are\r\nnot decisive to shew that a state of torpor, or suspended animation, may\r\nnot be endured for a much longer time by Toads that are healthy and well\r\nfed up to the moment when they are finally cut off from food, and from\r\nall direct access of atmospheric air.\r\n\r\n\"The common experiment of burying a Toad in a flower-pot covered with a\r\ntile, is of no value unless the cover be carefully luted to the pot, and\r\nthe hole at the bottom of the pot also closed, so as to exclude all\r\npossible access of air, earthworms, and insects. I have heard of two or\r\nthree experiments of this kind, in which these precautions have not been\r\ntaken, and in which at the end of a year the Toads have been found alive\r\nand well.\r\n\r\n\"Besides the Toads inclosed in wood and stone, four others were placed\r\neach in a small basin of plaster of Paris, four inches deep and five\r\ninches in diameter, having a cover of the same material carefully luted\r\nround with clay; these were buried at the same time and in the same\r\nplace with the blocks of stone, and on being examined at the same time\r\nwith them in December 1826, two of the Toads were dead, the other two\r\nalive, but much emaciated. We can only collect from this experiment,\r\nthat a thin plate of plaster of Paris is permeable to air in a\r\nsufficient degree to maintain the life of a Toad for thirteen months.\r\n\r\n\"In the 19th Vol., No. I, p. 167, of _Sillimans American Journal of\r\nScience and Arts_, David Thomas, Esq. has published some observations on\r\nFrogs and Toads in stone and solid earth, enumerating several authentic\r\nand well-attested cases. These, however, amount to no more than a\r\nrepetition of the facts so often stated and admitted to be true, viz.,\r\nthat torpid reptiles occur in cavities of stone, and at the depth of\r\nmany feet in soil and earth; but they state not anything to disprove the\r\npossibility of a small aperture, by which these cavities may have had\r\ncommunication with the external surface, and insects have been admitted.\r\n\r\n\"The attention of the discoverer is always directed more to the Toad\r\nthan to the minutiæ of the state of the cavity in which it was\r\ncontained.\"\r\n\r\nThe importance of these experiments, the care with which they were\r\ninstituted, the deserved reputation of the experimenter, and the\r\nphilosophic character of his inferences, will, I trust, apologise for\r\nthe extent of this quotation. I do not think, however, that the question\r\nis settled by them; and I will venture to make one or two comments on\r\nthe facts and on the observations.\r\n\r\nDr Buckland allows that the circumstances of the incarceration of his\r\nToads were not natural. This seems to me an element of more importance\r\nthan he attributes to it. They were shut up while in active life, after\r\nhaving been confined for two months on scanty food;--\"So that they were\r\nin an _unhealthy and somewhat meagre_ state at the time of their\r\nimprisonment.\" We do not know what conditions, what natural provisions\r\nprecede torpidity and are essential to it; but possibly there are some,\r\nwhich in these cases were compulsorily precluded by human interference.\r\nIt is stated that the animals that survived to the second year were\r\nalways found awake when examined,--\"_never in a state of torpor_.\" But\r\nToads that had hid themselves would have been torpid during the winter\r\nmonths; and thus we have a sufficient proof that a natural condition of\r\nbody had been by some means prevented. The experiment would be much more\r\nfair to the Toad, and much more conclusive to me, if the animal were\r\ninclosed during the depth of its winter-sleep, care being taken to\r\nhandle it as little as possible.\r\n\r\nAs it was, however, _most of the Toads_ inclosed in the limestone\r\n_survived upwards of thirteen months_. This surely is a very remarkable\r\nfact. Take the case of No. 9. Here was a Toad, nearly full grown, which\r\nhad been shut up in a stone cell, covered with a plate of glass\r\ncarefully luted down all round, so as to exclude air, buried under three\r\nfeet of earth, so as to exclude the smallest gleam of light; yet, at the\r\nexpiration of thirteen months, the cell being examined in winter, when\r\nnormally all Toads ought to be sound asleep, this Toad was wide awake,\r\nnot in the least emaciated, but so thriving in its strange dungeon as\r\nactually to have made 128 grains of flesh! to have actually increased in\r\nweight at the rate of 12-1/2 per cent.!\r\n\r\nDr Buckland says, \"It is probable there was some aperture in the luting\r\nby which small insects found admission.\" But this is altogether a\r\n_petitio principii_: it absolutely begs the question at issue. Are not\r\nthese insects entirely gratuitous? The luting was, of course, carefully\r\nlaid on: there could be no drying to cause contraction, buried as it was\r\nin the earth; the glass was uninjured; no orifice was detected; and yet,\r\nforsooth, it must be assumed that \"small insects found admission.\" Then,\r\ntoo, consider the problem. It is not the possibility that a\r\nmicroscopically minute insect or two may have managed in some\r\ninscrutable way to insinuate themselves, but insects sufficient to\r\nsupport this large Toad for thirteen months, and to make it at the end\r\nof that time 128 grains heavier than it was when first inclosed! There\r\nis the fact, as stated by this careful observer; and I am sure his\r\nhypothesis of intrusive insects will not account for it.\r\n\r\nI might make similar remarks on No. 5. The glass was \"_slightly_\r\ncracked.\" No insects were discovered in it; nor is any perceptible\r\norifice alluded to; yet this Toad had increased from 1185 grains to 1265\r\ngrains. The \"_slight_ crack\" in the glass makes this example less\r\nremarkable at first sight than the other; but in reality it is equally\r\ninscrutable. Insects, however minute, do not pass through glass merely\r\ncracked; but the requirement is the admission of insects enough to make\r\nan increase of flesh of 80 grains' weight, besides maintaining the waste\r\nof the Toad during thirteen months. Where, in each case, was the\r\nexcrement corresponding to such an augmentation? An insect-diet, as\r\nevery naturalist knows, leaves a very considerable residuum of\r\nindigestible, incorruptible, chitinous matter: the f{oe}cal remains of\r\nan insect-diet sufficient to keep an adult Toad in condition for\r\nthirteen months, and leave him 128 grains heavier than at first, would\r\nform no inconsiderable or inconspicuous mass. Yet the silence of the\r\nobserver on so conclusive an evidence proves that it was utterly\r\nwanting.\r\n\r\nThe Toads which survived longest were the largest specimens. Perhaps it\r\nrequires a condition of peculiar vigour to bear the incarceration. Even\r\nthese were all dead before two years had elapsed. But then it must be\r\nremembered that they had been disturbed: they had been taken out,\r\nhandled, and weighed, and replaced; and during the second year they had\r\nbeen examined \"several times.\" Air, it is true, was not admitted in\r\nthese later examinations; but _light was_; and it may be that the\r\nabsence of all external stimulus (and light is a potent one) is\r\nindispensable to the prolongation of vitality under conditions so\r\nabnormal.\r\n\r\nNo one supposes that incarceration in solid rock is an ordinary event in\r\nthe life of even a Toad. However it occur,--granting that it may\r\noccur,--it must surely be a rare accident happening to an individual\r\nhere and there, from which millions of Toads are exempt. We may\r\nreasonably suppose, too, that not one in a hundred so accidentally\r\nincarcerated would survive, the accident in the majority of cases\r\nproving fatal. If we bear in mind these not unreasonable presumptions,\r\nwe shall not hastily decide that all the recorded discoveries of Toads\r\nimmured are proved false and impossible, because we have not succeeded\r\nin finding a case of longevity out of four-and-twenty Toads, many of\r\nthem little ones, which we took and violently immured at our pleasure.\r\n\r\nTo my own mind these interesting experiments are far more corroborative\r\nthan contradictory of the popular belief. The amazing fact remains, that\r\nan adult vertebrate air-breathing animal can certainly live, and\r\nincrease in size, shut up in a stone cell, debarred from light and air\r\nand food, for a period between one and two years! What have we parallel\r\nto this in the whole range of natural history? _C'est le premier pas qui\r\ncoûte._ After the first year has passed so auspiciously, why may not a\r\nsecond? a third? and so indefinitely--under circumstances peculiarly\r\nfavouring? It is by no means certain that there are not such favouring\r\ncircumstances, because we cannot precisely predicate what they are. And\r\nif we admit the reported cases to be--only a few of them--true, we\r\ncannot evade the conclusion, that the longevity of these imprisoned\r\nToads must be immense, incalculable. For a Toad that emerges when a\r\nblock of stone is split up, from a matrix that fits (say somewhat\r\nroughly, if you please) its form and size, must have been there ever\r\nsince the stone was in a soft state, how long soever that may have\r\nbeen. Nor does it in the least affect the question, that there may have\r\nbeen some minute crack in the matrix through which insects, sufficient\r\nto support life, entered. This circumstance, I say, if satisfactorily\r\nproved, would not touch the question of time. And surely it is a marvel\r\nof colossal magnitude that a vertebrate animal should have maintained\r\nits life shut up in a mass of stone ever since the deposition of the\r\nmatter in a solid form, even though we be able to eliminate from it the\r\nelement of total abstinence during the entire period.\r\n\r\nBut facts are upon record which prove the possibility of Toads surviving\r\na protracted incarceration, effected by man, and therefore without their\r\nwill. In 1809, on opening a gap in a wall at Bamborough, in\r\nNorthumberland, for the passage of carts, a Toad, which had been\r\nincarcerated in the centre of a wall, was found alive, and set at\r\nliberty. A mason, named George Wilson, when building this wall, sixteen\r\nyears before, had wantonly immured the animal, in a close cavity formed\r\nof lime and stone, just sufficient to contain it, and which he plastered\r\nso closely as seemingly to prevent the admission of air. When\r\ndiscovered, it seemed at first, as must naturally be supposed, in a very\r\ntorpid state; but it soon recovered animation and activity, and, as if\r\nsensible of the blessings of freedom, made its way to a collection of\r\nstones, and disappeared.[107]\r\n\r\nMr F. W. L. Ross of Broadway House, near Topsham, an acute and\r\nexperienced naturalist, narrates the following circumstances:--\"In the\r\nyear 1821, I was residing in the country, and in my court-yard was a set\r\nof stone steps for mounting on horseback. These being useless to me, I\r\ndesired they might be removed. On taking them down, the lowest step, a\r\ncoarse red conglomerate, measuring about three feet in length, ten\r\ninches in depth, and about fourteen in width, was raised by a heavy bar.\r\nIt had been well bedded in mortar, in which, while soft, a Toad had been\r\nevidently placed, as there was no appearance of any way by which it\r\ncould have found ingress or egress, the mould or cast being as perfect\r\nas if taken in plaster. On the removal of the stone, the Toad remained\r\ntorpid for a few minutes, when it seemed to revive, and then crept out.\r\nFrom the owners of the property I ascertained that the steps had been\r\nplaced there forty-five years before, and, to the best of their\r\nknowledge, had never been moved.\r\n\r\n\"The second account is from a clergyman, and originated in my informing\r\nhim of the above. He caused a pit to be dug in his garden, six feet\r\ndeep; at the bottom was laid a slate, on which a full-sized Toad was\r\nplaced, with an inverted flower-pot over it. The hole and edges were\r\nwell luted with clay; the pit was then filled in, and on that day twelve\r\nmonths reopened, when the Toad was found alive, and as well as when\r\ninclosed in its living tomb. If, therefore, it could exist in such a\r\nstate for twelve months, it is not impossible that it might do so for a\r\nmuch longer period.\"[108]\r\n\r\nThese curious facts derive confirmation and augmented interest from\r\nsome apparently parallel conditions observed of other animals, widely\r\nremoved in the organic scale from the Reptilia, and that on both sides.\r\nSome glimpses of an indefinitely protracted torpidity in Wasps are given\r\nto us in a communication from an eminent entomologist, Mr G. Wailes of\r\nNewcastle, to the Entomological Society of London, and published in\r\ntheir \"Proceedings\" of March 5, 1860. These Rip Van Winkles of the\r\ninsect race choose, it seems, the tops of loftiest mountains for going\r\nto their long sleep. Who knows what might be found if a clever\r\ninsect-hunter were to go stone-turning on the peaks of Ararat? Read the\r\nfollowing, young enterprising entomologists! and set out.\r\n\r\n\"It is very evident that we have a great deal yet to learn about the\r\nSocial Wasps, and therefore the following remarks as to _Vespa vulgaris_\r\nmay be interesting. Ever since 1829 I have, at intervals, searched the\r\nsummit of Skiddaw (3022 feet) for specimens of _Leistus montanus_, and\r\non every occasion have taken out from underneath the loose fragments of\r\nthe slate perfectly torpid females of this Wasp, with the wings, legs,\r\nantennæ, &c., precisely in the state in which we find them during winter\r\nin the lower lands. Not unfrequently I have met with dead specimens\r\nwhich seemed to have perished in the same dormant state, and been there\r\nfor a year or two at least. Mr Smith, in his catalogue of the British\r\nVespadæ, under this species, states that Mr Wollaston found the female\r\nabundant under stones on the extreme summit of Gribon Oernant, near\r\nLlangollen, in September 1854, adding, 'probably hybernating for the\r\nwinter,' but had evidently forgotten my writing to him on the subject.\r\nMy visits to the mountain have extended from the latter end of June to\r\nthe latter end of August, and therefore it necessarily follows that\r\neither these specimens of the female Wasp were those of the previous\r\nyear, or that this sex appears much earlier in the season than has\r\nhitherto been supposed. But in either case the question arises, why are\r\nthey torpid during these the hottest months of the year? It is quite\r\ntrue that the temperature of the altitude is below that of the plains,\r\nespecially during the night, and I have myself been enveloped in falling\r\nsleet and snow more than once, both in June and August, though, as a\r\nrule, the Cumberland mountains seldom have a thick covering of snow, and\r\noften only a few inches once or twice in the winter. Still, the\r\ntemperature of ordinary mountains always approaches that of the plains\r\nin summer, and, one would have expected, was in Britain at least\r\nsufficiently high to rouse these Wasps in their winter quarters, when\r\nevery other insect under the same stones was active and stirring, and\r\nthe air so warm and bright that _Larentia salicata_ and _Crambus\r\nfurcatillus_ were sporting in the mid-day sun above them. Such, however,\r\nwas not the case, and when turned out of their snug, dry quarters, they\r\nallowed themselves to be handled and put into pill-boxes just as they do\r\nin winter. We may therefore ask, when are these sleepers to awake? for\r\nas the ground temperature reaches its maximum during the months in which\r\nI have met with them, and Mr Wollaston has found them in a similar\r\nstate in September, when a declining temperature has set in, we must\r\nconclude that for that year all prospect of their subsequent issue from\r\ntheir retreats through the influence of heat is barred. Can this be\r\ncalled hybernation, as it is usually understood? Or is there some other\r\ncause of torpidity besides mere cold? Or are we to conclude that when\r\nonce put to sleep in these lofty regions, they wake no more unless\r\nkindly removed into a milder clime by a stray entomologist, when, as I\r\nhave always noticed, they become as active as those of the warm\r\nlowlands?\"[109]\r\n\r\nMr Westwood, in the conversation that ensued on this communication,\r\nsuggested that these female Wasps had been the founders of colonies in\r\nthe preceding spring, and, after performing their maternal duties, had\r\nretired to die in the situations in which they were found by Mr Wailes.\r\nBut with all due deference to so great an authority, is not this another\r\nexample of those \"explanations\" which are thrown off without a due\r\nconsideration of the exigencies of the case in hand--explanations which\r\nreally explain nothing? For though this hypothesis might account for\r\nWasps found under such conditions in June, it will not do for the\r\nSeptember findings. Insects that had performed the end of their\r\nexistence and had retired to die in June, would not live through July\r\nand August, and be found alive in September. Besides, Mr Wailes\r\ndistinctly affirms, that _they always become active_ when removed to a\r\nmilder clime, which is proof positive that they had not retired to die.\r\nMr Smith's hypothesis, that they are \"probably hybernating for the\r\nwinter,\" will not account for their torpidity in June and July. Mr\r\nWestwood's hypothesis, that they are moribund individuals after their\r\nspring work, will not explain their vitality till September, and their\r\nrevivification when removed.\r\n\r\nBut these are insects; and the difference between vertebrate and\r\ninvertebrate life is so vast that, after all, the possibilities of the\r\nlatter may not have much bearing on those of the former. What, then,\r\nshall we say to an indefinite prolongation of life under like dreary\r\nconditions in--_Bats_? _Bats_, which are true vertebrata; and no\r\namphibia grovelling at the bottom of the vertebrate ladder, where the\r\ndim flame of spinal life is just glimmering in the socket, but\r\n_Mammalia_, and those of nearly the highest type;--_Bats_, which Linnæus\r\nassociated with _Homo sapiens_ himself in his first Order _Primates_!\r\nCan _these_ live for years shut up from light and food and air? these\r\ngreat-chested, well-lunged, warm-blooded, aerial quadrupeds?\r\n\"Impossible! I would not believe it, if----\" Stay! make no rash vows;\r\nbut read, weigh, and judge. Remember,--both the following statements are\r\nby clergymen, each of whom is a well-known, careful, experienced\r\nnaturalist.\r\n\r\n\"A very curious instance,\" says Mr Pemberton Bartlett, \"of the great\r\nlength of time that a Bat can remain in a state of torpidity, came under\r\nmy notice about three weeks since; and as I believe instances of the\r\nkind are but rarely observed, perhaps an account of the facts of the\r\ncase may not prove uninteresting. Upon opening a vault in Bishopsbourne\r\nchurch, the bricklayer observed a large Bat clinging to the wall.\r\nThinking it a curious thing to find a Bat in a vault which he knew had\r\nnot been opened for twenty years, in the evening he sent it to me by his\r\nboy, who, when he arrived at the door, was tempted to open the basket to\r\nlook at the inmate, when most unfortunately it made its escape, and\r\nflitted into a leaden spout which was placed against the house, from\r\nwhence I was unable to recover it. Upon learning the particulars of its\r\ndiscovery, I made a careful search about the vault, but was unable to\r\ntrace any hole or crack through which the smallest Bat could have crept.\r\nThe bricklayer also informed me that there was no place where a Bat\r\ncould have entered, in the part where he opened the vault, as the\r\nentrance was bricked up, and over the steps was a slab which fitted\r\nclose. If, indeed, it had been possible for a Bat to have got between\r\nthis, the brickwork at the entrance would most effectually have\r\nprevented it from finding an asylum in the vault. The natural inference\r\ntherefore is, that the Bat must have got into the vault when it was last\r\nopened, and consequently had been entombed since the year 1823! It was\r\nmost unfortunate that I was unable to decide what species it was; but,\r\nfrom the bricklayer's description, I think it must have been\r\n_Vespertilio Pipistrellus_. When first taken out of the vault it was in\r\na torpid state, but the effects of the air may be imagined from its\r\ntaking the first opportunity to escape in the evening; it flew,\r\nhowever, far more 'leaden winged' than ever bats are wont to fly, which\r\nwas by no means marvellous, when we consider it had been out of practice\r\nfor twenty-one years.\"[110]\r\n\r\nThe next account, by the Rev. A. C. Smith, of Yatesbury Rectory, Calne,\r\nis one of peculiar interest. The narrator actually witnessed the\r\ndiscovery. His investigation was pursued with the cautious care, and his\r\nstatement is made with the precision, which belong to science; and the\r\ndetails are so full, and his remarks so appropriate, that though the\r\nstory is somewhat long, I cannot bring myself to abridge it. It bears\r\ndate, Feb. 18, 1854. Of course, the reader will note how these two\r\nnarratives yield each other mutual corroboration.\r\n\r\n\"While effecting some repairs in the pavement of the aisle of my church,\r\na short time since, the masons found it necessary to remove some bricks\r\nfrom the solid wall of an adjacent vault, in order the better to adjust\r\nan iron bar intended to support the superincumbent flagstone. It seems\r\nthat one or two bricks being removed, and several large and handsome\r\ncoffins being exposed to view, curiosity tempted one of the workmen to\r\nreach his hand in with a lighted candle, in order to see the names and\r\ndates on the coffins; the result of which investigation shewed that the\r\nlast coffin was placed there in 1748. During this search I entered the\r\nchurch, just in time to witness the extreme surprise, and the no little\r\nconsternation, of the man, whose hand had suddenly come in contact with\r\na Bat, suspended from the roof of the vault. The Bat was soon brought\r\nto light; and, in its half-torpid state, placed in my hand. We then\r\nproceeded to make a very minute examination of this vault with a lighted\r\ncandle, in order to discover, if possible, by what means the Bat could\r\nhave penetrated to its resting-place: but, although our search was very\r\ncareful and long continued, we failed to discover the smallest crack or\r\ncrevice in which a pin could be thrust. The roof was an arch of brick,\r\nsurmounted by flagstones; the sides were solid masonry, bearing no\r\nappearance internally of decay; and the position of the vault was very\r\nnear the centre of the church: so that I was much puzzled to account for\r\nthe occurrence of the Bat in a place apparently hermetically sealed for\r\nabove a hundred years; and knew not how to combat the opinion of the\r\nworkmen, that it must have been entombed there alive since the year\r\n1748.\r\n\r\n\"I now proceeded to institute inquiries regarding the vault in which the\r\nBat was found. The marble monument above, recorded the names of an old\r\nWiltshire family long since extinct in these parts, and the dates of the\r\nthree coffins below, corroborating the statement of the brass plate,\r\nthat the individual last buried died A.D. 1748. Several old men in the\r\nparish remembered an adjacent vault being opened, when they were boys,\r\nnearly sixty years since: but all positively denied that the vault in\r\nquestion had ever been opened in their lives: and one, a very old man,\r\nformerly clerk, and whose then residence abutted on the churchyard, was\r\nvery emphatic on this point. So that I am constrained to believe that\r\nthe vault has remained untouched since it received its last occupant, a\r\nhundred and six years ago: and I am the more convinced of this from the\r\nexcessive freshness of the last coffin, the brass plate and nails of\r\nwhich are as bright, and its whole appearance as new, as if it had been\r\nplaced there but yesterday, which would not have been the case had the\r\nexternal air been admitted at any time since the vault was closed.\r\n\r\n\"During the time of the examination of the vault, the Bat was held in my\r\nhand, and above an hour must have elapsed since its capture before I was\r\nenabled to take it to the Rectory, and place it under an inverted glass:\r\nby this time the warmth of my hand had considerably revived it, and it\r\nwandered round its prison, snuffing about with its curious nose, and\r\nstanding up, and trying to hook itself on to the smooth glass, which\r\nbaffled all its attempts. As it obstinately refused to eat small pieces\r\nof chopped meat, with which I tempted it to break its fast, which may\r\nhave continued a hundred and six years, and after which I should have\r\nimagined it to be ravenous; and as it lay on its side, apparently in a\r\ndying state, humanity urged me to give it a chance of life, by restoring\r\nit to liberty, and I accordingly carried it to the garden, where I\r\nplaced it upon the turf, and watched its movements. At first it clung to\r\nthe blades of grass, and shivered a good deal; presently it fluttered\r\nalong the ground; soon it rose upon the wing, though in an awkward\r\nmanner, and although it sank several times, as if about to fall to the\r\nground, and as if it had not found the use of its wings, (which might\r\nhave been a little stiff for want of exercise, if they had been closed\r\nabove a hundred years), it passed behind a clump of trees and I saw it\r\nno more; and then I began to regret, when too late, that I had not made\r\nmore efforts to keep it alive and watch its recovery. I know little of\r\nthe different species of Bats, but, from its diminutive size, and\r\nextremely long ears, I should imagine it to be the _Vespertilio auritus_\r\nof Gilbert White.\r\n\r\n\"Now, if the hypothesis be deemed absurd that the Bat had been immured\r\nin the vault since 1748, how then are we to account for its presence\r\nthere? For although I am aware that a Bat, and especially one of the\r\nsmallest species, would creep through a very small crack or crevice, yet\r\nthe evidence of my own senses, after a very close examination, convinces\r\nme that not even the smallest crack existed between the bricks of the\r\nvault; and I think the evidence no less conclusive that the vault has\r\nremained untouched for a great number of years. Again, notwithstanding\r\nthe disbelief of some, it is very generally acknowledged that Toads do\r\noccasionally exist in blocks of stone and in timber; and the material in\r\nwhich they are inclosed having gradually formed around them, they must\r\nnecessarily have been entombed, in some well-authenticated cases, for a\r\nvery long period of time. Why then, I ask, should we deny that to be\r\npossible with the Bat, which we so readily concede to be an occurrence\r\nby no means unusual with the Toad? I own, that, taking all these things\r\ninto account, and finding no other possible solution for the mystery, I\r\ncame to the conclusion, after mature deliberation, that the Bat had\r\nbeen entombed in the vault since it last was opened in the year 1748.\r\nThat impression has increased upon longer reflection, and has been\r\nfurther strengthened almost into certainty, from the perusal of a very\r\ninteresting and very similar case, recorded by the Rev. J. P. Bartlett\r\nin an early volume of the _Zoologist_ (_Zool._, 613.)[111] That\r\ngentleman states, that on opening a vault which had been closed for\r\ntwenty-one years, a Bat was discovered in a torpid state; that he\r\nhimself made a very careful search about the vault, and was unable to\r\ndiscover any crack through which the smallest Bat could have crept; that\r\nthe vault was surrounded with brickwork; the entrance was bricked up,\r\nand over the steps was placed a close-fitting slab; and that he could\r\ncome to no other conclusion than that the Bat had been inclosed there\r\nfor twenty-one years. I confess that I quite agree in opinion with Mr\r\nBartlett, and believe that the Bat discovered in the vault in\r\nBishopsbourne church crept in on the occasion of its last opening: and\r\nso in the like manner with the one found in my own church; for although\r\nthere is unquestionably a vast difference between twenty-one and a\r\nhundred and six years, yet, if we can establish the fact of a Bat\r\nremaining torpid for the shorter period, I find no difficulty in\r\nunderstanding that a sleep which would endure so long as that did, might\r\nbe protracted to a far longer period. It is most probable that many will\r\ndiffer from me in opinion, and perhaps some will ridicule the idea: if\r\nthey can discover any other probable or even possible means of\r\naccounting for the presence of the Bat in the vault, exclusive of a\r\ncrack or chink in it, or of its having been opened within the memory of\r\nliving man, both of which views I firmly oppose, I shall feel greatly\r\nobliged by their stating their opinions in the _Zoologist_: meanwhile I\r\nhold to my belief, that the Bat had been there for not less than _one\r\nhundred and six years_!\"[112]\r\n\r\n[97] Bell's _Brit.

They migrate, you reply,\r\nto a warmer parallel. That is true, no doubt; though there have not\r\nbeen wanting naturalists of respectable name who have maintained that\r\nnone of them ever leave the country. No doubt, however, they do migrate;\r\nbut is this true of the entire body, or only of a portion? That the\r\nwhole hirundinal population--swifts, swallows, martins, and\r\nbank-martins--disappear from view, every one knows; for who ever saw any\r\nof the tribe wheeling and traversing through the sky in the frosts of\r\nJanuary or February? But so do the Bats and the Butterflies. Now, the\r\nBats hybernate with us, concealing themselves in crevices, caves, hollow\r\ntrees, unused buildings, and similar places; so do the house-flies; so\r\ndo the butterflies, some species at least, and many other insects. Do\r\nthe Swallows hybernate? That they do is a very old opinion; and those\r\nhomely but wide-spread rhymes that record so many accepted facts in\r\npopular natural history, record _this_ as a fact. Our rustic children\r\nsing--\r\n\r\n      \"The bat, the bee, the butterfly,\r\n        The cuckoo and the swallow,\r\n      The corn-crake and the wheat-ear,\r\n        They all sleep in the hollow.\"\r\n\r\nLocal variations--what we may call _lectiones variæ_--exist; for\r\nexample, in the south-east of our island, the third line runs,\r\n\r\n      \"The corn-crake and the _nightingale_.\"\r\n\r\nIn the north of Europe an opinion has long prevailed that the Swallows\r\nnot only hybernate in a state of torpidity, but, like the frogs and\r\ntoads, retire to the bottoms of pools to spend that dreary season. In\r\nBerger's \"Calendar of Flora,\" published in the _Am{oe}nitates\r\nAcademicæ_, vol. iv., he puts down as the phenomenon proper to the 22d\r\nof September, \"_Hirundo submergitur_,\" talking, as Gilbert White\r\nremarks, as familiarly of the Swallows going under water, as he would of\r\nhis poultry going to roost at sunset. Klein, and even Linnæus himself,\r\nadopted this strange opinion, which was considered to rest upon good\r\ntestimony, and that not only of the illiterate and unobservant.\r\nEtmuller, who was Professor of Anatomy and Botany at Leipsig in the\r\nmiddle of the seventeenth century, says, \"I remember to have found more\r\nthan a bushel would hold of Swallows closely clustered among the reeds\r\nof a fish-pond under the ice, all of them to appearance dead, but with\r\nthe heart still pulsating.\" And Derham, the acute author of\r\n\"Physico-theology,\" citing this statement, adds, \"We had at a meeting of\r\nthe Royal Society, February 12, 1713, a further confirmation of Swallows\r\nretiring under water in the winter from Dr Colas, a person very curious\r\nin these matters, who, speaking of their way of fishing in the northern\r\nparts by breaking holes and drawing their nets under the ice, saith,\r\nthat he saw sixteen Swallows so drawn out of the Lake of Lamrodt, and\r\nabout thirty out of the king's great pond in Rosneilen; and that at\r\nSchlehitten, near a house of the Earl of Dohna, he saw two Swallows just\r\ncome out of the waters, that could, scarcely stand, being very wet and\r\nweak, with their wings hanging on the ground; and that he observed the\r\nSwallows to be often weak for some days after their appearance.\"[113]\r\n\r\nThe Academy of Upsal received the winter submersion of the Swallows as\r\nan undoubted fact, and even Cuvier admits as \"well authenticated, that\r\nthey fall into a lethargic state during winter, and even that they pass\r\nthat season at the bottom of marshy waters.\"[114] One would think that a\r\nzoological statement which Linnæus and Cuvier accepted, must be fact;\r\nyet it remains utterly improbable. In Germany, a reward of an equal\r\nweight in silver was publicly offered to any one who should produce\r\nSwallows found under water, but we are assured that no one was found to\r\nclaim the money.\r\n\r\nWe may safely dismiss the notion of submersion till better\r\nauthenticated; but that of torpidity is still open to examination.\r\nStatements to the effect that quantities of Swallows in a death-like\r\ncondition have been found in hollow trees, holes in cliffs, banks, &c.,\r\nare even more common than those of their submersion; and they seem to\r\nobtain credence in all the temperate or cold regions where the Swallows\r\nare found. It is hard to think that a persuasion so widely diffused can\r\nbe wholly groundless.\r\n\r\nPeter Collinson, the friend and correspondent of Linnæus, communicated\r\nto the Royal Society the following statement by M. Achard:--\"In the\r\nlatter end of March I took my passage down the Rhine to Rotterdam. A\r\nlittle below Basel, the south bank of the river was very high and steep,\r\nof a sandy soil, sixty or eighty feet above the water.\r\n\r\n\"I was surprised at seeing, near the top of the cliff, some boys tied to\r\nropes, hanging down doing something. The singularity of these\r\nadventurous boys, and the business they so daringly attempted, made us\r\nstop our navigation, to inquire into the meaning of it. The waterman\r\ntold us they were reaching the holes in the cliffs for Swallows or\r\nMartins, which took refuge in them, and remained there all the winter,\r\nuntil warm weather, and then they came abroad.\r\n\r\n\"The boys being let down by their comrades to the holes, put in a long\r\nrammer, with a screw at the end, such as is used to unload guns, and,\r\ntwisting it about, drew out the birds. For a trifle I procured some of\r\nthem. When I first had them, they seemed stiff and lifeless; I put one\r\nof them in my bosom, between my skin and shirt, and laid another on a\r\nboard, the sun shining full and warm upon it; and one or two of my\r\ncompanions did the like. That in my bosom revived in about a quarter of\r\nan hour; feeling it move, I took it out to look at it; but perceiving it\r\nnot sufficiently come to itself, I put it in again; in about another\r\nquarter, feeling it flutter pretty briskly, I took it out, and admired\r\nit. Being now perfectly recovered, before I was aware, it took its\r\nflight; the covering of the boat prevented me from seeing where it went.\r\nThe bird on the board, though exposed to a full sun, yet, I presume from\r\na chilliness of the air, did not revive so as to be able to fly.\"[115]\r\n\r\nOn this account I may observe that Collinson would hardly have been the\r\nmedium of this communication, unless he had been satisfied of the\r\nprobity of his correspondent. The time was \"the latter end of March,\" a\r\nfortnight at least before the arrival of the Sand Martin--the earliest\r\nof our migrants; and the whole enterprise of the boys, and the\r\nfamiliarity of the waterman with the circumstance, as well as their\r\nassertions, shew that they, at least, had no doubt about this being a\r\ncase of hybernation. Yet the repeated exploration of the Sand Martin's\r\nburrows in this country, in winter, has produced no birds.\r\n\r\nWhite of Selborne, who was very much interested in the solution of this\r\nquestion, mentions two instances--both, however, on hearsay evidence. A\r\nclergyman assured him that, when he was a boy, some workmen, in pulling\r\ndown the battlements of a tower, early in spring, found two or three\r\nSwifts _among the rubbish_, which appeared dead, but revived in the\r\nwarmth. The other account was that of the fall of a portion of the cliff\r\nnear Brighton in winter, when many persons found Swallows among the\r\nrubbish; but here even White's informant did not see the birds, but was\r\nmerely told of them.[116]\r\n\r\nBishop Stanley, in his \"Familiar History of Birds,\" has collected some\r\nstories which appear circumstantial enough, if we could be quite sure\r\nthey were authentic; on which point the good bishop seems to give the\r\nweight of his own character, since he observes that they are \"cases\r\nwhich have come to our knowledge, on the most respectable authority.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the 16th of November 1826, a gentleman residing near Loch Awe, in\r\nScotland, having occasion to examine an out-house, used as a cart-shed,\r\nsaw an unusual appearance upon one of the rafters which crossed and\r\nsupported the thatched roof. Upon mounting a ladder, he found to his\r\nastonishment that this was a group of Chimney-swallows (_Hirundo\r\nrustica_) which had taken up their winter quarters in this exposed\r\nsituation. The group consisted of five, completely torpid: and none of\r\nthe tribe to which they belonged had been seen for five or six weeks\r\npreviously: he took them in his hand, as they lay closely and coldly\r\nhuddled together, and conveyed them to his house, in order to exhibit\r\nthem as objects of curiosity to the other members of his family. For\r\nsome time they remained to all appearance lifeless; but the temperature\r\nof the apartment into which they were carried being considerably raised\r\nby a good turf fire, they gradually evinced symptoms of reanimation; and\r\nin less than a quarter of an hour, finding that they were rather rudely\r\nhandled, all of them recovered, so as to fly impatiently round the room,\r\nin search of some opening by which they might escape. The window was\r\nthrown up, and they soon found their way into the fields, and were never\r\nseen again. A similar circumstance, though, from the place of its\r\ndiscovery it must refer probably to Sand Martins, was related by a\r\ngentleman who found two Swallows in a sand-bank at Newton, near\r\nStirling, quite dormant.\r\n\r\n\"Again, about half-a-dozen Swallows were found a few years ago, in a\r\ntorpid state, in the trunk of a hollow tree, by a countryman, who\r\nbrought them to a respectable person, by whom they were deposited in a\r\ndesk, where they remained forgotten till the following spring, when, one\r\nmorning, on hearing a noise, he opened the desk, and found one of them\r\nfluttering about: the others also began to shew signs of life, and upon\r\nbeing placed out of doors in the sun, speedily arranged their plumage,\r\ntook wing, and disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"On the 2d of November 1829, at Loch Ransa, in the island of Arran, a\r\nman, while digging in a place where a pond had been lately drained off,\r\ndiscovered two Swallows in a state of torpor; on placing them near the\r\nfire, they recovered. One unfortunately escaped, but the other was kept\r\nby the man, for the purpose of shewing it to some scientific persons.\"\r\n\r\nIn North America there is a curious species of Swift, (_Acanthylis\r\npelasgia_,) which associates in immense flocks to roost in chimneys and\r\nhollow trees. It is the popular belief that these birds spend the winter\r\nin a torpid condition in their roosting trees. Williams, in his \"History\r\nof Vermont,\" speaks of a large hollow elm which had been for many years\r\nappropriated to this purpose. A farmer resident close to the tree was\r\npersuaded that it was the winter dwelling-place of the Swifts, and\r\navoided felling it on that account. About the 1st of May, he always saw\r\nthem come out of it in large numbers, about the middle of the day, and\r\nin a short time return. Then, as the weather grew warmer, they came\r\nforth in increased multitudes in the morning, and did not return till\r\nnight. A similar account was given of another tree: the first appearance\r\nof the Swifts in spring was always their emergence from its hollow\r\ntrunk, and their last, in September, was their ingress. Yet Wilson, the\r\ngreat ornithologist of America, argues, not without some heat, yet with\r\nconsiderable force, that such a belief is erroneous. Erroneous,\r\ncertainly, the supposition that the whole body of the Chimney-swifts so\r\nhybernate; but whether a few do or do not, his arguments do not quite\r\nconclude.\r\n\r\nThe rustic quatrain, quoted in the outset of this disquisition, mentions\r\nthe Corncrake, as associated with the Swallow in this winter-sleep,--\"in\r\nthe hollow.\" It is curious that two modern instances are on record of\r\nhybernating Corncrakes, though this is certainly as migratory a species\r\nwith us as the _Hirundinidæ_. A farmer at Aikerness in Orkney, about\r\nmidwinter, in demolishing a mud-wall, found a Corncrake in the midst of\r\nit. It was apparently lifeless; but being fresh to the feel and smell,\r\nit was placed in the warmth. In a short time it began to move, and in a\r\nfew hours was able to walk about, and lived for two days in the kitchen;\r\nwhen refusing all food, or rather, none that suited it being then\r\nobtainable, it died.[117]\r\n\r\n\"The second case occurred at Monaghan, in Ireland, where a gentleman,\r\nhaving directed his labourers, in winter, to remove a large heap of\r\nmanure, that had remained undisturbed for a great length of time,\r\nperceived a hole, which was supposed to have been made by rats; it\r\npenetrated to a great depth, but at its termination, instead of rats,\r\nthree Corncrakes were discovered, as if placed there with the greatest\r\ncare, not a feather being out of its place, and apparently lifeless. The\r\nbirds on examination were, however, considered to be in a torpid state,\r\nand were placed near a fire in a warm room. In the course of a short\r\ntime a tremulous motion was observed in one of their legs, and soon\r\nafter a similar motion was noticed in the legs and wings of the whole,\r\nwhich at length extended itself to their whole bodies, and finally the\r\nbirds were enabled to run and fly about the room.\"[118]\r\n\r\nDaines Barrington, the correspondent of Gilbert White and of Pennant,\r\nwas a firm believer in the winter sleep of Swallows with us. He\r\nmentions, on the authority of Lord Belhaven, that numbers of Swallows\r\nhad been found in old dry walls and in sandhills near his lordship's\r\nseat in East-Lothian; not once only, _but from year to year_, and that\r\nwhen they were exposed to the warmth, they revived. He says, however, he\r\ncannot determine the particular species.[119]\r\n\r\nThe same naturalist mentions many other instances in which they have\r\nbeen reported to be found, but he cannot give his personal voucher for\r\nthe truth of the statements.\r\n\r\n\"As first in a decayed hollow tree, that was cut down near Dolgelly, in\r\nMerionethshire; secondly, in a cliff near Whitby, in Yorkshire, where,\r\nin digging out a fox, whole bushels of Swallows were found in a torpid\r\ncondition; thirdly, the Rev. Mr Conway, of Lychton, Flintshire, a few\r\nyears ago, between All Saints' and Christmas, on looking down an old\r\nlead mine in that county, observed numbers of Swallows clinging to the\r\ntimbers of the shaft, seemingly asleep, and on flinging some gravel on\r\nthem they just moved, but never attempted to fly or to change their\r\nplace.\"[120]\r\n\r\nIn some communications to the _Zoologist_ for 1845, by the late Mr F.\r\nHolme, of Oxford, I find the following statement:--\"On the hybernation\r\nof this species (the House-swallow) I was told many years since, by old\r\nWall, then keeper of the Kildare Street Museum, in Dublin, ... that\r\nafter a heavy snow, in the winter of 1825-26, on going into the\r\n_mansarde_ to see whether the snow had melted through, he found four\r\nChimney-swallows perched close together on a cross-beam, with their\r\nheads under their wings; but on approaching his hand to them they flew\r\noff, and escaped into the open air.\"[121]\r\n\r\nAgain, Mr J. B. Ellman of Battel, says, \"There is a farmer named Waters,\r\nresiding at Catsfield, (adjoining parish,) who informs me he has\r\nfrequently (some years ago) dug Swallows out of banks in winter, while\r\nwidening the ditches in the brooks,\" &c.[122]\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that most of these and similar discoveries were \"some\r\nyears ago;\" and that, instead of increasing in frequency with the\r\nincrease of scientific research and communication, they strangely become\r\nmore rare. The same remark applies to the following statement: it is\r\nminute enough, and circumstantially precise; but, unfortunately, it was\r\n\"fifteen years ago.\" The communicator is Edward Brown Fitton, Hastings,\r\nunder date September 8, 1849:--\r\n\r\n\"A labourer named William Joyce, who is now employed in excavating part\r\nof the East Hill for the foundation of a house, told me yesterday, that,\r\nin the month of December, about fifteen years ago, while he was working\r\nfor Mr William Ranger, who had the contract for cutting away the 'White\r\nRock,' which used to stand between this place and St Leonard's, the men\r\nfound an immense quantity of Swallows in a cleft of the rock. The birds\r\nwere clinging together in large 'clots,' and appeared to be dead, but\r\nwere not frozen together, the weather being rather warm for the season,\r\nnor were they at all putrid or decayed. The men carried out at least\r\n_three railway-barrows_ full of birds, which were buried with the mould\r\nand rubbish from the cliff as it was wheeled away. Some people from the\r\ntown carried away a few of the birds to 'make experiments with,' but\r\nJoyce never heard any more of them. He mentioned the names of four\r\npersons now in Hastings, who were then his fellow-labourers, and says,\r\nthat forty or fifty of Mr Ranger's men were on the spot when the birds\r\nwere found, and can confirm what he says, both as to the finding and the\r\nvery great quantity of the birds. There are many crevices in the seaward\r\nsurface of the cliffs about here, which apparently penetrate the cliff\r\nfor several yards. The birds were found about ten feet from the surface\r\nof the rock facing the sea, and not very high up.\"[123]\r\n\r\nThere is yet another class of facts to be adduced, which has an\r\nimportant bearing on the subject. At first sight, these facts appear\r\nless conclusive than the asserted discoveries of the birds, because less\r\ndirect; but I am inclined to attach more value to them, because they are\r\nattested by so many and so unexceptionable witnesses. I mean the sight\r\nof Swallows at large in these islands during the winter months. Let us\r\nsee some examples.\r\n\r\nWhite of Selborne records several cases: thus, in 1773, twenty or thirty\r\nHouse-martins were playing in the air all day on the 3d of\r\nNovember,[124] after having disappeared from the 22d of October. In\r\n1772, he saw three House-swallows gliding by on the sea-shore at\r\nNewhaven, on the 4th of November.[125] On another occasion, (the year\r\nnot being recorded,) he saw, on a sunny morning, a House-martin flying,\r\nat Oxford, on the 20th of November.[126] On the 26th of November 1768,\r\none of his neighbours saw a Martin hawking briskly after flies.[127] And\r\na very respectable gentleman assured him that on a remarkably hot day,\r\neither in the last week in December or the first week in January, he\r\nespied three or four Swallows in the moulding of a window of Merton\r\nCollege, Oxford.[128]\r\n\r\nColonel Montagu remarks that \"there are a variety of instances of the\r\nSwallow and Martin having been seen flying in the months of November and\r\nDecember, roused probably from a state of torpidity by an unusual warmth\r\nof the air;\"[129] and Captain H. W. Hadfield, commenting on this,\r\naffirms that he has \"more than once had ocular proof of their presence\r\nduring the winter months.\"[130] Yarrell gives examples of the late\r\nappearance of the Swift. One was seen by Mr Blackwall on the 20th of\r\nOctober 1815; a second in Perthshire on the 8th of November 1834; and a\r\nthird in Devonshire, by the Rev. Mr Cornish, on the 27th November\r\n1835.[131] In considering these cases, it is needful to bear in mind\r\nthat the Swift migrates from this country annually from the 1st to the\r\n15th of August.\r\n\r\nMr C. R. Bree mentions the following case, which I record, not because\r\nit was particularly late, but because the state of the season, and some\r\nother circumstances which he remarks on are interesting:--\"On the 25th\r\nof October 1848, some workmen being engaged on the roof of my house, I\r\nwas surprised by the appearance of three Swallows flying about the men.\r\nI had not seen one since the beginning of the month. By the side of the\r\nedge of the gable-end of the house the plaster was broken away, forming\r\na hole, which led under the roof. While watching the birds, which came\r\noccasionally quite close to my face, I saw first one, then another,\r\nalight upon the ledge of the gable-end, near the hole. Now, I thought, I\r\nam to settle the question of hybernation: but I was disappointed. Though\r\nI watched them for several hours--though I sent the workmen to another\r\npart of the house, yet, although they frequently settled about the hole,\r\nthey never entered it. They were evidently young birds, and had been\r\ndisturbed. One of them rested upon the chimney, and appeared weak and\r\ndull. I lost sight of them during the day; but the following morning,\r\nthe weather being warm, I saw several flying about high up in the air.\r\nThere is some mystery about these things. Why have these late\r\nappearances been more remarked this year than other years? How did the\r\nbirds obtain food during the three weeks of bitter cold weather when\r\nthey were not seen in October?\"[132]\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of December 1843, a specimen of the Swallow, _an adult bird,\r\nnot a young of the season_, (an important circumstance,) in full plumage\r\nand good condition, was shot at Goole, in the West Riding, and was sent\r\nto Mr R. J. Bell, of Derby, a good ornithologist,[133] who records the\r\nfact. In 1852, that excellent naturalist, Mr Hewitson, of Oatlands, saw\r\ntwo Chimney-swallows at Eshar on the 18th of November, and on the 21st\r\nhad four martins about his house.[134] In 1855, Mr E. Vernon Harcourt\r\nreports the occurrence of several Martins skimming about at Uckfield on\r\nthe 23d of November; and on the 6th of December several Chimney-swallows\r\nabout the house at Hastings.[135] In the same season flocks of Martins\r\nwere hawking vigorously, in the vicinity of Penzance, to the 28th of\r\nNovember, as witnessed by Mr E. H. Rodd.[136] Captain Hadfield again,\r\nwriting in 1856, gives extracts from his journals, whereby he records\r\nhaving seen Swallows and Martins as late as November 3, 1841, December\r\n2, 1842, November 13, 1852, November 22, 1853, November (about the\r\nmiddle) 1854, and November 24 (Swallows) and December 2 (Martins) 1855.\r\nOf the last-mentioned occurrence he gives the following interesting\r\nnote:--\"Dec. 2, 4 P.M. Observed eight Martins flying round the garden,\r\nand occasionally alighting on the perpendicular face of the wall of a\r\nhouse near my garden gate, to which they would cling for a few seconds,\r\nand then, dropping off, whirl round, returning to the same spot,\r\nseemingly quite unconscious of my presence and that of several others:\r\nthey seemed bent on effecting an entrance under the eaves of the house,\r\nby a small opening they had discovered near a water-pipe that had been\r\ncarried through the wall: they were, I believe, all young birds of the\r\nseason, as they appeared small, their tails being also shorter than in\r\nthe adults; they were weak on the wing, but that may have arisen from\r\ntheir being benumbed by the cold, the thermometer standing at 44° only\r\nat the above hour. There had been a bright sun during the greater part\r\nof the day, but I had observed a white frost in the morning. I conclude\r\nthat these late birds were merely seeking a roosting-place for the\r\nnight, and not a place of concealment for the winter, although I might\r\nhave been excused, according to Cuvier, White, &c., had I thought they\r\nwere taking up their winter quarters; but I have not sufficient faith in\r\nthe theory to induce me to unslate a part of the roof to seek for them,\r\nwhich might be done, however, at a trifling cost, provided permission\r\nwere obtained.\"[137]\r\n\r\nIt is rather a pity that the observer had not confidence enough to\r\ninduce him to make the investigation which he suggests.\r\n\r\nMr William Bree mentions as many as fifteen or twenty Martins and\r\nSwallows sporting in the air near Temple Balsall on the 18th November\r\n1846, adding that he has frequently seen individuals much later, but\r\nnever recollects to have seen so great a number together at that late\r\nperiod. And, finally, Mr J. Johnston, jun., reports that he saw, in the\r\nafternoon of 18th January 1837, three Swallows dipping and hawking as in\r\nsummer, near Wakefield.[138]\r\n\r\nThere is less evidence of the appearance of these birds before the\r\nordinary time of arrival of the migrants. But White, when a boy,\r\nobserved a Swallow for a whole day together on a sunny warm Shrove\r\nTuesday, which day could not fall out later than the middle of March,\r\nand often happened early in February.[139] And Mr Samuel Gurney, jun.,\r\ntogether with several other persons, saw either a Martin or Swallow, on\r\nthe 27th of March 1844.[140]\r\n\r\nIf this last occurrence had stood alone, it would have been of slight\r\nimportance; for Yarrell mentions a single Swallow as having been seen by\r\na fisherman near the Eddystone as early as the 4th of April; and\r\nSand-martins, even as far north as Carlisle, before the end of March. It\r\nis just possible that these may have been stragglers of the great army\r\nof migrants, arriving some ten or fifteen days before their time; but\r\nconsidering the whole great array of evidence, I rather believe that\r\nthese too were hybernants, who had been prematurely awakened from\r\ntorpidity by unusually warm days.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of _Hirundines_ having been found in a somnolent state in\r\nwinter may or may not be true; though the great number of such\r\nstatements in various and distant countries makes the indiscriminate\r\nrejection of them even more difficult than the acceptance. But still\r\nthere remains the undeniable fact that it is quite an ordinary thing for\r\nbirds of this family, including all our four common species, to be seen\r\nwith us through November and December, and occasionally in\r\nJanuary;--that is, for two or three months after the great body of\r\nmigrants have left the country. No one, I suppose, pretends that\r\nmigration of Swallows takes place in December or January; therefore it\r\nis manifest that a certain number--more or fewer--remain. What becomes\r\nof them? We certainly see them only occasionally: where are they on the\r\ndays on which they do not appear,--days extending to several consecutive\r\nweeks? If they had not been torpid during those weeks, if the more\r\nactive functions of life had not been suspended, would they not\r\ncertainly have been starved? But the specimen shot on the 10th December,\r\nand examined by Mr Bell, was in good condition, which is consistent with\r\nbut one alternative; either it had been well fed throughout the\r\npreceding six weeks, or it had been hybernating. But the former\r\nsupposition implies that it had been habitually on the wing during that\r\nperiod, as Swallows feed only on the wing; which could not have been the\r\ncase without its being noticed and recorded.\r\n\r\nIt is common to say that these occasional winter Swallows are the later\r\nbroods of young, which, being too infantile to migrate, are compelled to\r\nlinger in the country of their nativity, and becoming lethargic from the\r\nadvancing cold, at length die before the spring. But when this\r\nhypothesis is looked at, it seems hardly tenable. In many of the\r\ninstances recorded, the specimens seen even late into the winter, are\r\nrepresented as gaily and vigorously hawking for flies, or sweeping over\r\nthe water as in summer. This does not look like poor deserted orphans\r\nstarved with the cold, retiring to die; but birds in health, temporarily\r\nawakened from normal slumber by an unusual temperature, and instantly\r\nready for a full use of their faculties. However, to settle the point by\r\nfact, Mr Bell distinctly states that his specimen of December 10th was\r\n\"an adult bird, _not_ a young bird of the season.\"\r\n\r\nIf it should be asked why they do not appear in January or February, as\r\nwell as November and December, the answer is obvious. The winter's\r\nlethargy of hybernating warm-blooded vertebrates is much more readily\r\ninterrupted in the earlier part of the season than in the middle and\r\nlatter part. And this is natural; for the more intense cold of January\r\nbenumbs and suspends the vital functions far more completely, and the\r\n_coma_ so superinduced is sufficiently deep to resist the counteracting\r\ninfluence of a few warm days, even though the temperature should be as\r\nhigh as on those earlier days that awakened them, or even higher.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate evidence, then, seems to leave no room for reasonable\r\ndoubt, that a certain number of our _Hirundinidæ_,--few, indeed, as\r\ncompared with the vast migrant population, but still considerable,\r\nlooked at _per se_,--for some reason or other, evade the task of a\r\nsouthward flight, and remain, becoming torpid, occasionally betrayed\r\ninto a temporary activity, and resuming their active life, about the\r\nsame time, or occasionally a little _before_ the time, of the arrival of\r\ntheir congeners from abroad. It is, however, desirable for the absolute\r\nsettlement of the question, that specimens, actually discovered in a\r\nlethargic condition, should come under the observation of competent\r\nscientific naturalists, _open to conviction_, who would leave them _in\r\nsitu_, keeping an eye on them from time to time till the return of warm\r\nweather in spring. It is not enough to take them into a warm room, and\r\nto shew that they revive in such circumstances: we want to know\r\npositively whether they will be resuscitated normally and naturally by\r\nthe vernal warmth, and come forth spontaneously to sport, and wheel, and\r\nskim, and soar, and stoop, and hawk, and twitter,--among their travelled\r\nfellows. Who will undertake to decide the point in this manner? He will\r\nhave achieved a name in science.\r\n\r\n[113] _Phys.

It had been gathered by Albert Seba, a\r\nwealthy apothecary in the Dutch East India Company's service, who\r\nfortunately published an elaborate description of its contents. This\r\ngreat work, \"_Locupletissimi Rerum Naturalium Thesauri accurata\r\nDescriptio_,\"--in four volumes folio, published from 1734 to 1765,--is\r\neven now remarkable for the accuracy and beauty of its copious\r\nengravings, which still are referred to as authorities, though the\r\ndescriptions are devoid of scientific value. Many of these figures and\r\ndescriptions, about whose reality no shadow of doubt exists, are those\r\nof creatures which are altogether unknown to modern science, and some of\r\nthem are highly curious.\r\n\r\nSerpents seem to have been a special hobby of Seba's; and he has\r\ndelineated a vast number of species. Among them are two[141] about which\r\na singular interest hangs. They are of rather small size; the one pale\r\nyellow, marked with oval reddish spots, the other reddish, with five\r\ngreen transverse bands. The head in each case has a horny-pointed\r\nmuzzle, and the cheeks are furnished with depending wattles of a\r\ncoral-red hue.\r\n\r\nFrom the expressions of wonder with which Seba introduces his\r\ndescriptions of these animals, it is evident that they were no ordinary\r\nforms. He does not know whether to call them Eels or Serpents, the\r\ncritical characters, which in our day would instantly determine this\r\npoint, being then scarcely heeded. He calls them \"marine,\" but whether\r\non any other evidence than the pendent processes of the cheeks, which he\r\ncalls \"fins,\" does not appear. But no fish known to naturalists will\r\nanswer to these representations. The pointed head, indeed, resembles in\r\nsome respects that of _Mur{oe}na_, but this genus of fishes is altogether\r\ndestitute of pectoral fins, while the vertically-flattened tail, and the\r\nlong dorsal and anal fins confluent around the extremity of the body in\r\n_Mur{oe}na_, are totally unlike these figures. These and all similar fishes\r\nare, moreover, destitute of visible scales; but in these the scaling is\r\ndecidedly serpentine, and the second, in particular, has large\r\nsymmetrical plates across the belly, while the head in both is shielded\r\nwith broad plates like a Colubrine Snake. The tail is drawn out to a\r\nlong conical point, without the slightest appearance of compression or\r\nof bordering fins. In one figure there is seen a little projecting point\r\nat the edge of the lower belly, which at first sight suggests the idea\r\nof the anal hook of a _Boa_, but which, by comparison with other\r\nfigures, we discover to be intended to represent the projection of the\r\npre-anal scale. The very minuteness of this character makes it valuable:\r\nits value was doubtless unheeded by the artist, who merely drew what he\r\nsaw; it is, however, a very decisive mark of distinction between a\r\nserpent and a fish.\r\n\r\nSeba records that he had received these Serpents from the Island of St\r\nDomingo. This was at that time a flourishing French colony, and its\r\nnatural productions were far better known to Europe than they now are.\r\nWhen I visited the neighbouring island of Jamaica in 1845-46, I heard\r\naccounts of a wonderful animal occasionally seen in the eastern\r\ndistricts of the island, which was reported as a Snake with a cock's\r\ncomb and wattles, and which crowed like a cock. A good deal of mystery\r\nattached to this strange Serpent.\r\n\r\nIt was appropriated to a very remarkable and peculiar character of\r\nscenery:--A wild mountain-region, formed of white limestone, abounding\r\nin narrow glens, bounded by abrupt precipices, and permeated by\r\nwhispering streams that frequently pour in slender cascades over the\r\nrocks. The limestone rock rises in abrupt terraces, wall above wall, and\r\nits entire surface is most singularly honeycombed, \"as if wrought by a\r\ngraving tool into rough diamond-points,\" alternating with smooth and\r\nrounded holes of various sizes, from that of a hazel-nut upward. In many\r\nof these hollows lie the small land-shells of the country, bleached\r\nperfectly white, like the stone itself, of the genera _Helix_,\r\n_Cyclostoma_, _Helicina_, _Cylindrella_, _Achatina_, &c., many of them\r\nperfect, but many more in fragments. They exactly resemble fossil shells\r\n_in situ_, but the species are absolutely identical with those that\r\ncrawl over the shrubs and trees in the same region. In very many cases\r\nthe dead shells accurately fit the hollows in the rock, whose interior\r\nis impressed with the form and sculpturing of the shell in\r\n_intaglio_:--a most curious and interesting fact, as it points to the\r\nvery recent formation of the region, the stone bearing evident tokens of\r\nhaving been in a plastic condition when the shells were enveloped in it.\r\nOut of the hollows of the rock, their roots fast grasping the\r\nsharp-edged projections and tooth-like points of stone, and twining\r\nthrough the tortuous cavities, and insinuating their fibrils into every\r\nminute hollow where water may lodge, grow many tall trees of various\r\nkinds, interlaced with climbers, and hung with festoons of _lianes_,\r\nthat resemble long and twisted cords, thrown from one to another, or\r\ndepending from the branches towards the ground. The noble Agave, or what\r\nwe in England call the American Aloe, here throws out its broad, fleshy,\r\nspine-edged leaves, and lifts its tall flower-stalk loaded with the\r\ncandelabra-like branches of bloom; and numerous thick _Cacti_, some\r\nerect and massive, others whip-like, long and trailing, give a peculiar\r\naspect to the vegetation. Great tufts of _Orchide{oe}_,--the lovely\r\n_Broughtonia_, with its thick ovate leaves, and racemes of elegant\r\ncrimson flowers, the _Brasavola_, with long leaves resembling\r\nporcupine-quills in form, and blossoms of virgin white, the _Oncidium_,\r\nwith its yellow and red flowers, like a score of painted butterflies\r\ndancing in every breath, and many others,--crowd the forks or droop from\r\nthe twisted boughs of the trees.\r\n\r\nThis formation of honeycombed limestone is full of caverns, many of\r\nwhich lead into one another in chains, and which have invested the\r\nregion with a sort of superstitious mystery. Runaway slaves and outlaws\r\nhave availed themselves of the facilities which its ravines and\r\ninaccessible fastnesses afford, to defy capture; and during the\r\nrebellion of the Maroons, it attained a considerable notoriety. There is\r\none estate about eight miles from Kingston, in the immediate vicinity of\r\nwhich the famous hero, Three-fingered Jack, made his head-quarters. It\r\nis a district of wild torrents and waterfalls of the most romantic\r\ncharacter; \"the imagination of no painter of theatrical spectacles can\r\nsurpass the wild wonders of the mountain-hold of the _real_\r\nThree-fingered Jack. Part of the road by which you ascend the falls is a\r\nsubterranean passage; and caverns are entered by simple crevices which\r\nseem mere chinks in the irregular surface of the rock, all which natural\r\npeculiarities account for the mysterious disappearances which the\r\nmountain hero was enabled to enact from his pursuers.\"\r\n\r\nIt was at this spot I first heard reliable tidings of the strange\r\nCrested Snake. A medical gentleman of reputation informed me that he had\r\nseen, in 1829, a serpent of about four feet in length, but of unwonted\r\nthickness, dull ochry in colour with well-defined dark spots, having on\r\nits head a sort of pyramidal helmet, somewhat lobed at the summit, of a\r\npale red hue. The animal, however, was dead, and decomposition was\r\nalready setting in. He informed me that the negroes of the district were\r\nwell acquainted with it; and that they represented it as making a noise,\r\nnot unlike the crowing of a cock, and as being addicted to preying on\r\npoultry.\r\n\r\nNor is it in Jamaica alone that the Crested Snake is known. In the\r\nisland of St Domingo, whence Seba received his curious specimens, my\r\nfriend Mr Hill heard reports of it. A Spanish gentleman whom he was\r\nvisiting in Hayti, told him that he had seen it, and begged him to note\r\nit among the remarkable things of the country. It was in that far east\r\nof the island, known as the ancient Caciquedom of Higuey, where the\r\nIndians were of a more warlike disposition than their meek brethren of\r\nthe centre and west, and where the cruelties perpetrated upon them by\r\ntheir Spanish invaders reached such a superhuman pitch of diabolism,\r\nthat even Las Casas says he almost feared to repeat them. The limestone\r\nmountains are here of exactly the same description as those in Jamaica,\r\nand the scenery assumes exactly the same romantic character. My friend's\r\nSpanish informant had seen the serpent with mandibles like a bird, with\r\na cock's crest, with scarlet lobes or wattles; and he described its\r\nhabits,--perhaps rather from common fame than from personal\r\nobservation,--as a frequenter of hen-roosts, into which it would thrust\r\nits head, and deceive the young chickens by its imitative physiognomy,\r\nand by its attempts to crow, like their own Chanticleer. \"Il canta como\r\nun Gallo;\" was the report in Hayti, just as in Jamaica.\r\n\r\nI was much interested in this mysterious reptile, and mentioned in the\r\npublic papers my wish to possess a specimen. A gentleman of the\r\nvicinity, Mr Jasper Cargill, was so desirous to oblige me that he\r\noffered a sovereign for one; but though several persons were prompt to\r\npromise the capture, no example was forthcoming.\r\n\r\nAfter my return from Jamaica, the occurrence of two specimens found came\r\nunder the notice of my friend, but neither of them was preserved. Mr\r\nCargill had informed him that some years before, when visiting Skibo, in\r\nSt George's, an estate of his father's, in descending the mountain-road,\r\nhis attention was drawn to a snake of a dark hue, that erected itself\r\nfrom amid some fragments of limestone-rock that lay about. It was about\r\n_four feet long_, and unusually _thick-bodied_. His surprise was greatly\r\nincreased on perceiving that it was _crested_, and that from the side of\r\nthe cheeks depended some _red-coloured flaps_, like gills or wattles.\r\nAfter gazing at him intently some time, with its head well erect, it\r\ndrew itself in, and disappeared among the fragmentary rocks.\r\n\r\nThe son of this gentleman met with another specimen under the following\r\ncircumstances, as detailed to me by my friend:--\"It was, I think, on\r\nEaster Eve, the 30th of March last, [1850,] that some youngsters of the\r\ntown came running to tell me of a curious snake, unlike any snake they\r\nhad ever seen before, which young Cargill had shot, when out for a day's\r\nsport among the woodlands of a neighbouring penn. They described it as\r\nin all respects a serpent, but with a very curious shaped head, and with\r\nwattles on each side of its jaws. After taking it in hand and looking at\r\nit, they placed it in a hollow tree, intending to return for it when\r\nthey should be coming home, but they had strolled from the place so far\r\nthat it was inconvenient to retrace their steps when wearied with\r\nrambling; but they had lost no time in relating the adventure to me,\r\nknowing it would interest me much, particularly as young Cargill's\r\nfather had thought it a snake similar to the one he had seen at Skibo,\r\nin St George's, or to the crested serpent for a specimen of which, when\r\nin St Thomas's in the East, he had offered the sum of twenty shillings.\r\nThe youth that shot the snake fell ill on the following morning with\r\nfever, and could not go back to the woodlands to seek it, but he sent\r\nhis younger brother who had been with him; but although he thought he\r\nrediscovered the tree in which his brother had placed it, he could not\r\nfind the snake. He conjectured that the rats had devoured it in the\r\nnight. When this adventure was related to me, another youth, Ulick\r\nRamsay, a godson of mine, who came with the young Cargills to tell me of\r\ntheir discovery, informed me that not long previously, he had seen in\r\nthe hand of the barrack-master-serjeant at the barracks in Spanish Town,\r\na curious snake, which he, too, had shot among the rocks of a little\r\nline of eminences near the railway, about two miles out, called\r\nCraigallechie. It was a serpent with a curious shaped head, and\r\nprojections on each side, which he likened to the fins of an eel, but\r\nsaid they were close up to the jaws. Here are, unquestionably, two of\r\nthe same snakes with those of Seba's Thesaurus, taken near Spanish Town,\r\nand both about the honeycombed rocks that protrude through the plain of\r\nSt Catherine's in detached ridges and cones and hummocks, being points\r\nof the greater lines of limestone, which have been covered by the\r\ndetritus of the plains, leaving masses of the under-rocks here and there\r\nuncovered. These are the spots frequented, too, by the _Cyclura_; and\r\nare continuations of our Red Hills--a country that so much resembles the\r\nterraced cliffs and red-soil glens of Higuey.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that I have heard nothing more of this serpent of\r\nrenown, this true Basilisk, from that time till now; though I have no\r\ndoubt my Jamaica friends, who had become much interested in the matter,\r\nwould have communicated the specimen to me if any one had been obtained.\r\nThere is, however, sufficient evidence to assume the existence of such a\r\nform in the greater Antilles, whether Seba's figures be identical with\r\nit or not.\r\n\r\n[141] _Op. cit._; vol. ii. pl. 40.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nTHE DOUBTFUL.\r\n\r\n\r\nA very curious and unaccountable habit is attributed to some Reptiles,\r\nwhich, though asserted by many witnesses, at different times and in\r\ndistant countries, has not yet received the general assent of men of\r\nscience. White of Selborne, in one of his charming letters to Pennant,\r\nhas the following note:--\"Several intelligent folks assure me that they\r\nhave seen the Viper open her mouth and admit her helpless young down her\r\nthroat on sudden surprises, just as the female Opossum does her brood\r\ninto the pouch under her belly, upon the like emergencies. Yet the\r\nLondon viper-catchers insist on it, to Mr Barrington, that no such thing\r\never happens.\"[142]\r\n\r\nThe evidence of the London viper-catchers goes for no more than it is\r\nworth; those whom Mr Barrington applied to,--how many and of what\r\nexperience I know not,--had not met with such a case. But negative\r\nevidence is of little weight against positive. At the same time, others\r\nof the same fraternity affirm the fact. There is, as Mr Martin observes,\r\nno physiological reason against the possibility of the young maintaining\r\nlife for a brief period within the stomach of the parent. A swallowed\r\nfrog has been heard, by Mr Bell, to cry several minutes after it had\r\nbeen swallowed by a snake; and the same excellent authority has seen\r\nanother frog leap out of the mouth of a snake which had swallowed it,\r\ntaking advantage of the fact that the latter gaped, as they frequently\r\ndo, immediately after taking food.\r\n\r\nMr Martin says he has conversed with several who had been assured by\r\ngamekeepers and gardeners that the swallowing of the young by vipers had\r\nbeen witnessed by them.[143] And Mr Blyth, a zoologist of established\r\nreputation, observes,--\"I have been informed of this by so many credible\r\neye-witnesses, that I cannot hesitate in yielding implicit credence to\r\nthe fact. One man particularly, on whose word I fully rely, tells me\r\nthat he has himself seen as many as thirteen young vipers thus enter the\r\nmouth of the parent, which he afterwards killed and opened for the\r\npurpose of counting them.\"[144]\r\n\r\nMr E. Percival, writing to the _Zoologist_, under date \"64\r\nLincoln's-Inn-Fields, Oct. 17, 1848,\" narrates the following\r\nfacts:--\"When in Scotland, last autumn, I saw what at the time satisfied\r\nme that vipers really possessed this faculty, though the evidence was\r\nscarcely as conclusive as might have been wished. Walking along a sunny\r\nroad, I saw a viper lying on the parapet. She had apparently just been\r\nkilled by a blow from a stick. Five or six young ones, about four inches\r\nlong, were wriggling about their murdered parent, and one was making its\r\nway out of her mouth, at the time when I approached. Whether this was\r\nthe first time the young ones had seen the light, or whether they were\r\nonly leaving a place of temporary refuge, I leave to more experienced\r\nobservers than myself to determine.\"[145]\r\n\r\nThis communication brought out the following from the late Mr John\r\nWolley:--\"Mr Percival's interesting note (_Zool._, 2305) on this subject\r\nreminds me of a very similar anecdote, told me several years ago by a\r\ngentleman who is an accurate observer, and who has had long experience\r\nin all kinds of sports. He one day shot a viper, and almost immediately\r\nafterwards it was surrounded by young ones, in what appeared to him the\r\nmost mysterious manner. But here the grand link was wanting which Mr\r\nPercival has supplied,--the young ones were not seen to come out of\r\ntheir mother's mouth. I may be allowed to mention an anecdote, told me\r\nin 1842, by an illiterate shepherd of Hougham, near Dover: he met me\r\ncatching vipers, and, on my entering into conversation with him, he\r\nvolunteered--without any allusion of mine--to tell this curious story.\r\nOne day his father came suddenly upon a viper surrounded by her young,\r\nshe opened her mouth and they all ran down her throat; he killed her,\r\nand leaving her on the ground, propped her mouth open between two pieces\r\nof stick; presently the young ones crawled out: on the slightest alarm\r\nthey retreated back again,--and this they did repeatedly for several\r\ndays, during which time many people came to see it.[146] The young which\r\nWhite of Selborne cut out of the old female, and which immediately\r\nthrew themselves into attitudes of defiance, had probably not then seen\r\nthe daylight for the first time. Mr Bell, in a note in Bennett's edition\r\nof White's 'Selborne,' mentions the wide-spread belief in this alleged\r\nhabit of the viper; but appears to consider the fact not proved.\r\nAccounts of similar habits in foreign viviparous snakes, common report,\r\nand, above all, Mr Percival's observation, leave no doubt on my mind\r\nabout the matter.\"\r\n\r\nThe most recent case on record that I have met with, is the following,\r\ncommunicated to the _Zoologist_[147] for last December, by the Rev.\r\nHenry Bond, of South Petherton:--\r\n\r\n\"Walking in an orchard near Tyneham House, in Dorsetshire, I came upon\r\nan old adder basking in the sun, with her young around her; she was\r\nlying on some grass that had been long cut, and had become smooth and\r\nbleached by exposure to the weather. Alarmed by my approach, I\r\ndistinctly saw the young ones run down their mother's throat. At that\r\ntime I had never heard of the controversy respecting the fact, otherwise\r\nI should have been more anxious to have killed the adder, to prove the\r\ncase. As it was, she escaped while I was more interested in the\r\ncircumstance I witnessed than in her destruction.\"\r\n\r\nExactly the same thing is told of the North American Rattlesnake. Hunter\r\nsays, that when alarmed, the young ones, which are eight or ten in\r\nnumber, retreat into the mouth of the parent, and reappear on its\r\ngiving a contractile muscular token that the danger is past.[148]\r\n\r\nM. Palisot de Beauvois asserts that he saw a large rattlesnake which he\r\nhad disturbed in his walks immediately coil itself up and open its jaws,\r\nwhen in an instant five small ones that were lying by it rushed into its\r\nopen mouth. He concealed himself, and watched the snake, and in a\r\nquarter of an hour saw her discharge them. He then approached a second\r\ntime, when the young ones rushed into the parent's mouth more quickly\r\nthan before, and the animal immediately moved off, and escaped. The\r\nphenomenon is said to have been observed in regard to some of the\r\nvenomous snakes of India, but I cannot now refer to details.\r\n\r\nConfirmation of a reported fact is sometimes derived from collateral\r\nevidence, and such is not wanting in the present case. The phenomenon is\r\nnot confined to serpents; it has been observed in their near relatives,\r\nthe lizards. Mr Edward Newman, while guarding the subject with a\r\nphilosophical caveat, furnishes his readers with the following highly\r\ninteresting and germane statement:--\"1st, My late lamented friend,\r\nWilliam Christy, jun., found a fine specimen of the common scaly lizard\r\nwith two young ones. Taking an interest in everything relating to\r\nNatural History, he put them into a small pocket vasculum to bring home;\r\nbut when he next opened the vasculum the young ones had disappeared, and\r\nthe belly of the parent was greatly distended; he concluded she had\r\ndevoured her own offspring; at night the vasculum was laid on a table,\r\nand the lizard was therefore at rest: in the morning the young ones had\r\nreappeared, and the mother was as lean as at first. 2d, Mr Henry\r\nDoubleday, of Epping, supplies the following information:--A person\r\nwhose name is English, a good observer, and one, as it were, brought up\r\nin Natural History, under Mr Doubleday's tuition, once happened to set\r\nhis foot on a lizard in the forest, and while the lizard was thus held\r\ndown by his foot, he distinctly saw three young ones run out of her\r\nmouth. Struck by such a phenomenon, he killed and opened the old one,\r\nand found two other young ones in her stomach, which had been injured\r\nwhen he trod upon her. In both these instances the narrators are of that\r\nclass who do know what to observe, and how to observe it; and the facts,\r\nwhatever explanation they may admit, are not to be dismissed as the\r\nresult of imagination or mistaken observation.\"[149]\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that all the serpents to which the phenomenon is\r\nattributed are ovo-viviparous. Our common lizard, to which the facts\r\njust narrated doubtless belong (_Zootoca vivipara_), has the same\r\nproperty, which, however, appears to be by no means common among the\r\nSaurian races. This coincidence, while it would afford a handle to the\r\ndeniers of the stated facts, in the assumption that the emergence of the\r\nliving young from the abdomen, or their presence within it, has given\r\nrise to the notion--may have an essential significance and connexion\r\nwith the phenomenon itself, on the hypothesis of its truth. That\r\nendowment, whatever it be, which enables the young to live and breathe\r\nin the abdominal cavity of the mother before birth, may render it easier\r\nfor them than for others not so endowed to survive a temporary\r\nincarceration within the stomach after birth. Mr Newman does not know\r\nhow to believe that a young and tender animal can remain in the strongly\r\ndigestive stomach of a viper and receive no injury; but he has forgotten\r\nto take into the account the well-ascertained power that living tissues\r\nhave the power of resisting the action of chemical re-agents that would\r\ninstantly take effect upon them when dead. The walls of the stomach\r\nitself are not corroded by the gastric-juice which is rapidly dissolving\r\nthe piece of meat within it. If the young animals can do without air for\r\na while in their snug retreat, I do not think they would need fear the\r\ndigestive operation. Air, I should suppose, _must_ be excluded from the\r\nstomach, unless the parent have the power of swallowing air voluntarily,\r\nfor the emergency; but perhaps a cold-blooded animal like a reptile,\r\nwith a sluggish circulation and respiration, might do with very much\r\nless fresh air than a mammal under similar conditions.\r\n\r\nThe proposed _rationale_ of those who reject these statements,--that\r\nfemale vipers in the last stage of pregnancy have been opened, and have\r\ngiven freedom to living and active young, and that careless and\r\nunscientific observers have leaped to the conclusion that their young\r\nmust have entered by the mouth,--will not stand before the testimony\r\ndistinctly given by witnesses, who have actually seen the young retreat\r\ninto the mouth, and have then found them within the body. No doubt the\r\nsubject needs further investigation by careful and unprejudiced\r\nnaturalists; but the positive evidence already adduced on the testimony\r\nof so many deponents, warrants our accepting the phenomenon as a normal\r\nhabit of certain species of Saurians and Ophidians, though it may be\r\nsomewhat rarely resorted to, and that whatever physical difficulties may\r\nseem to stand in the way of its _à priori_ probability--difficulties\r\nwhich perhaps depend on our ignorance, and which will disappear before\r\nthe light of advancing knowledge.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe entomologists have fallen most ungallantly foul of Madame Merian, a\r\nlady who resided in Surinam nearly two hundred years ago, and devoted\r\nher attention to the native entomology, painting insects in a very\r\nadmirable manner. She is set down as a thorough heretic, not at all to\r\nbe believed, a manufacturer of unsound natural history, an inventor of\r\nfalse facts in science.\r\n\r\nAmong other things, she speaks of a large hemipterous fly, which has in\r\nconsequence of her reports been named _Fulgora lanternaria_. This insect\r\nhas the head produced into a large inflated proboscis more than an inch\r\nin length, which is said to carry an intense luminosity within its\r\ntransparent walls, as a candle is carried within a lantern. The fair\r\nobserver says that the first discovery which she made of this property\r\ncaused her no small alarm. The Indians had brought her several of these\r\ninsects, which by daylight exhibited no extraordinary appearance, and\r\nshe enclosed them in a box until she should have an opportunity of\r\ndrawing them, placing it upon a table in her lodging-room. In the middle\r\nof the night the confined insects made such a noise as to awake her, and\r\nshe opened the box, the inside of which, to her great astonishment,\r\nappeared all in a blaze; and in her fright letting it fall, she was not\r\nless surprised to see each of the insects apparently on fire. She soon,\r\nhowever, divined the cause of this unexpected phenomenon, and\r\nre-enclosed her brilliant guests in their place of confinement. She adds\r\nthat the light of one of these Fulgoræ is sufficiently bright to read a\r\nnewspaper by: and though the tale of her having drawn one of these\r\ninsects by its own light is without foundation, she doubtless might have\r\ndone so if she had chosen.\r\n\r\nThis circumstantial and apparently truthful statement has brought no\r\nsmall odium on the fair narrator. Other naturalists who have had\r\nopportunities of seeing the insect in its native regions strongly deny\r\nits luminosity. The inhabitants of Cayenne, according to the French\r\nDictionnaire d'Histoire Naturelle, aver that it does not shine at all;\r\nand this is confirmed by M. Richard, a naturalist, who reared the\r\nspecies. The learned and accurate Count Hoffmansegg states that his\r\ninsect collector Herr Sieber, a practised entomologist of thirty years'\r\nexperience, who during a sojourn of several years in Brazil took many\r\nspecimens of the _Fulgora lanternaria_, never saw a single one which was\r\nin the slightest degree luminous. There is a kindred species in China,\r\n_F. candelaria_, very common in those glazed boxes of insects which the\r\nChinese sell to mariners; this also has been supposed to emit light, but\r\nDr Cantor assures us that he has never observed the least luminosity in\r\nthis species.\r\n\r\nThus it would seem that the obloquy which has fallen upon the ingenious\r\nlady is not altogether undeserved, and that for the sake of a telling\r\nstory, she has been indeed \"telling a story.\" But we may imagine her\r\noffended ghost looking round and saying, \"All these gentlemen merely say\r\nthey have _not_ seen the light; now I say I have: is there no one who\r\nwill verify my statement?\"\r\n\r\nM. Lacordaire,--an authority on South American insects second to none,\r\nsays that he himself indeed never saw a luminous _Fulgora_ all the time\r\nhe was collecting in Brazil and Cayenne, and that most of the\r\ninhabitants of the latter country, when questioned on the subject,\r\ndenied the fact, yet _that others of the natives as distinctly affirmed\r\nthat it is luminous_. He asks whether it is not possible that the light\r\nmay be confined to one sex, and thus the conflicting testimony be\r\nreconciled; and gives it as his opinion that the point is rather one\r\nwhich requires more careful observation, than one which we can consider\r\nabsolutely decided.[150]\r\n\r\nAgain, the Marquis Spinola, in an elaborate paper on this tribe,\r\npublished in the Annals of the Entomological Society of France,[151]\r\nstrenuously contends that the remarkable development of the frontal\r\nportion of the head in the whole race is luminous. And finally, a friend\r\nof Mr Wesmael assured him that he had himself seen the American\r\n_Fulgora_ luminous while alive.[152]\r\n\r\nIt may help to sustain our faith in the veracity of Madame Merian, to\r\nknow that there is some reason for attributing occasional luminosity to\r\nwell-known English insects, of which hundreds, and even thousands, have\r\nbeen taken without manifesting a trace of the phenomenon. Mr Spence, in\r\nhis interesting Letter on Luminous Insects,[153] adduces the following\r\nevidence:--Insects \"may be luminous which have not hitherto been\r\nsuspected of being so. This seems proved by the following fact: A\r\nlearned friend has informed me, that when he was curate of Ickleton,\r\nCambridgeshire, in 1780, a farmer of that place, of the name of\r\nSimpringham, brought to him a mole-cricket (_Gryllotalpa vulgaris_,\r\nLatr.), and told him that one of his people seeing a _Jack-o'-lantern_,\r\npursued it, and knocked it down, when it proved to be this insect, and\r\nthe identical specimen shewn to him.\r\n\r\n\"This singular fact, while it renders it probable that some insects are\r\nluminous which no one has imagined to be so, seems to afford a clue to\r\nthe, at least, partial explanation of the very obscure subject of _ignes\r\nfatui_, and to shew that there is considerable ground for the opinion\r\nlong ago maintained by Ray and Willughby, that the majority of these\r\nsupposed meteors are no other than luminous insects. That the large\r\nvarying lambent flames mentioned by Beccaria to be very common in some\r\nparts of Italy, and the luminous globes seen by Dr Shaw cannot be thus\r\nexplained, is obvious. These were probably electrical phenomena;\r\ncertainly not explosions of phosphuretted hydrogen, as has been\r\nsuggested by some, which must necessarily have been momentary. But that\r\nthe _ignis fatuus_ mentioned by Derham as having been seen by himself,\r\nand which he describes as flitting about a thistle, was, though he seems\r\nof a different opinion, no other than some luminous insect, I have\r\nlittle doubt. Mr Sheppard informs me that, travelling one night between\r\nStamford and Grantham on the top of the stage, he observed for more than\r\nten minutes a very large _ignis fatuus_ in the low marshy grounds, which\r\nhad every appearance of being an insect. The wind was very high:\r\nconsequently, had it been a vapour it must have been carried forward in\r\na direct line; but this was not the case. It had the same motion as a\r\n_Tipula_, flying upwards and downwards, backwards and forwards,\r\nsometimes appearing as settled, and sometimes as hovering in the air.\r\nWhatever be the true nature of these meteors, of which so much is said\r\nand so little known, it is singular how few modern instances of their\r\nhaving been observed are on record. Dr Darwin declares, that though in\r\nthe course of a long life he had been out in the night, and in the\r\nplaces where they are said to appear, times without number, he had never\r\nseen anything of the kind; and from the silence of other philosophers of\r\nour own times, it should seem that their experience is similar.\"\r\n\r\nA paper by Mr R Chambers on the subject adduces the additional\r\ntestimony of facts observed by good naturalists, as Dickson and\r\nCurtis the eminent botanists, and Stothard the painter and entomologist,\r\nby his own father Mr A. Chambers, and by Joseph Simpson, a fisherman\r\nliving near Boston, all of which strongly corroborate the probability\r\nthat some, at least, of the _ignes fatui_ are produced by luminous\r\ninsects.[154] Mr Main narrates the case of a farmer who stated\r\nthat he had pursued a Will-o'-the-wisp, and coming up with it had\r\nknocked it down, when it proved to be an insect \"exactly like a\r\nMaggy-long-legs\"--that is, the common Crane-fly (_Tipula oleracea_), the\r\nvery insect with which Mr Sheppard had compared the motions of the\r\nluminous flame observed by him.[155] Mr Spence argues that while gaseous\r\nemanations may be a cause of stationary _ignes fatui_, the same cause\r\nwill not explain those which flit along from place to place; and that\r\nthese are probably luminous insects, however rarely they may have come\r\nunder the notice of entomologists. \"A very strong argument for the\r\npossibility of some flying insects being occasionally luminous (in\r\nEngland) is afforded by the facts ... of luminous caterpillars having\r\nbeen within these few years observed for the first time since entomology\r\nhas been attended to, and that by observers every way competent. If\r\ncaterpillars so very common as those of _Mamestra oleracea_ may\r\nsometimes, though so rarely, be luminous, and if, as Dr Boisduval\r\nsuggests, and is very probable, this appearance was caused by disease,\r\nit is obvious that flying insects may be also occasionally (though\r\nseldom) luminous from disease--a supposition which will at once explain\r\nthe rarity of the occurrence, and the circumstance that insects of such\r\ndifferent genera, and even orders, are said to have exhibited this\r\nphenomenon.\"[156]\r\n\r\nThese highly curious facts should make observers cautious in strongly\r\ndenying statements made by others of phenomena, when they themselves\r\nhave not been so fortunate as to witness them, even though they may\r\nthink their opportunities to have been as favourable as those of the\r\n_soi-disant_ observer.[157]\r\n\r\nBut we have not yet dismissed Madame Merian. If acquitted of falsehood\r\nhere, she stands arraigned on a second charge of similar character.\r\n\r\nIn most tropical countries there are found hideous hairy spiders of\r\nmonstrous size and most repulsive appearance; short-legged, sombre-hued,\r\nferocious marauders of the night, that by day lurk in obscure retreats\r\nunder stones, or in burrows in the earth.\r\n\r\nGuiana produces a formidable species of this sort (_Mygale avicularia_),\r\nwhich measures three inches in length, and whose feet--though the genus\r\nis, as I have said, comparatively short-limbed--cover an area some\r\neight or ten inches in diameter. Madame Merian has exquisitely figured\r\nthe tragical end of a tiny humming-bird, surprised by one of these\r\nmonsters on her eggs; the petite bird overthrown under the fangs of the\r\nsprawling spider, one of whose feet is in the nest. It was on the\r\nauthority of this lady that Linnæus gave the name of _avicularia_ to the\r\nspecies. Later naturalists have scouted the whole story. Mr MacLeay, who\r\nresided in Cuba, says that there are indeed there huge spiders, allied\r\nto our garden spider, which make a geometric net, strong enough to\r\nembarrass small birds; but that these do not attempt to catch such prey,\r\nand never molest birds at all. On the other hand, he avers that the\r\nCuban _Mygale_, an allied species to that of Guiana, makes no web, and\r\nhas no power of injuring birds. He put this to the test of experiment;\r\nfor having maimed a humming-bird, he thrust it into the _Mygale's_ hole,\r\nwhich, instead of seizing the victim, retreated as in fear out of his\r\nden. This Mr MacLeay supposes to be conclusive; but a moment's\r\nreflection will shew how equivocal is the evidence. The spider may not\r\nhave been hungry; or he may have been taken aback by the sudden\r\nintrusion; or he might not choose to take prey that he had not stolen\r\nupon and slaughtered _suo more_; or he may have muttered in the\r\nArachnidan language,--\r\n\r\n      \"Timeo Danaos, et dona ferentes.\"\r\n\r\nBecause a wolf will cower down in the corner of his lair (even a tiger\r\nhas been known to do so)--when a man suddenly enters his presence, and\r\nwill manifest the most abject fear, would it be philosophical to\r\nridicule the tales told of wolves pursuing and devouring men by night?\r\n\r\nM. Langsdorff asked the people of Brazil if the Caranquexeira, or the\r\ngreat _Mygale_ of that country, fed upon humming-birds, when they\r\nanswered him, with bursts of laughter, that it only gratified its maw\r\nwith large flies, ants, bees, wasps, beetles, &c.; an answer which the\r\ntraveller verified by his own personal experience.[158] If M. Langsdorff\r\nmeans, which of course he does, that he learned by personal observation\r\nthat the spider _ordinarily_ feeds on insects, that fact is indubitable,\r\nand never has been doubted; but if he means that he had experience that\r\nit eats _only_ such prey, which is the question at issue, it is plain\r\nthat this experience proves no more than that he never witnessed such a\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nPercival, in his account of Ceylon, observes:--\"There is an immense\r\nspider here, with legs not less than four inches long, and having the\r\nbody covered with thick black hair.\" This was doubtless the _Mygale_ of\r\nthe island. \"The webs which it makes are strong enough to entangle and\r\nhold even small birds, which form its usual prey.\" Alluding to this\r\nstatement, Sir Emerson Tennent says:--\r\n\r\n\"As to the stories told of the _Mygale_ catching and killing birds, I am\r\nsatisfied, both from inquiry and observation, that, at least in Ceylon,\r\nthey are destitute of truth, and that (unless in the possible case of\r\nacute suffering from hunger) this creature shuns all description of food\r\nexcept soft insects and annelides.\" And yet he immediately adds:--\"A\r\nlady at Marandan, near Colombo, told me that she had, on one occasion,\r\nseen a little house-lizard (_gecko_) seized and devoured by one of these\r\nugly spiders.\"[159] Does he not, then, credit his informant? Or are\r\nlizards included in the category of \"soft insects and annelides?\"\r\n\r\nAgainst this incredulity, resting on no better than negative evidence,\r\none might adduce collateral proof from analogy. There _are_ spiders\r\nwhich feed on vertebrate animals, and there _are_ spiders whose webs\r\ncatch birds. The large and beautiful _Nephila claripes_ of tropical\r\nAmerica weaves strong threads of yellow silk in the paths of the woods,\r\nconverging to a web quite strong enough to arrest a bird of weak flight.\r\nIt must have been a species allied to this, but certainly, I think, not\r\nthe same, of which Dr Walsh speaks in his \"Travels in Brazil.\" \"Among\r\nthe insects is an enormous spider, which I did not observe elsewhere. In\r\npassing through an opening between some trees, I felt my head entangled\r\nin some obstructions, and on withdrawing it, my straw hat remained\r\nbehind. When I looked up I saw it suspended in the air, entangled in the\r\nmeshes of an immense cobweb, which was drawn like a veil of thick gauze\r\nacross the opening, and was expanded from branch to branch of the\r\nopposite trees as large as a sheet ten or twelve feet in diameter. The\r\nwhole of this space was covered with spiders of the same species but\r\ndifferent sizes; some of them, when their legs were expanded, forming a\r\ncircle of six or seven inches in circumference.[160] They were\r\nparticularly distinguished by bright spots. The cords composing the web\r\nwere of a glossy yellow, like the fibres of silkworms, and equally\r\nstrong.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a creature found in the tropical parts of both hemispheres,\r\ncalled _Solpuga_, which though not exactly a spider, is yet so closely\r\nallied to that family as to be in some measure responsible for its\r\nmisdoings. It is about as large as the _Mygale_, and, with sufficient\r\ngeneral resemblance to it to warrant its being popularly considered a\r\nspider, it has much the same habits and appetites. Captain Hutton, in a\r\nmost interesting memoir, describes the details of an Indian species\r\nunder the name of _Galeodes vorax_. Among many other details, he\r\nsays--\"This species is extremely voracious, feeding at night upon\r\nbeetles, flies, and even large lizards; and sometimes gorging itself to\r\nsuch a degree as to render it almost unable to move. A lizard, three\r\ninches long, _exclusive of tail_, was entirely devoured; the spider\r\nsprung at it, and made a seizure immediately behind the shoulder, never\r\nquitting its hold until the whole was consumed. The poor lizard\r\nstruggled violently at first, rolling over and over in its agony, but\r\nthe spider kept firm hold, and gradually sawed away with its double jaws\r\ninto the very entrails of the victim. The only parts uneaten were the\r\njaws and part of the skin, although the lizard was at least five inches\r\nlong from nose to extremity of tail. After this meal, the spider\r\nremained gorged and motionless for about a fortnight, being much\r\nswollen and distended.\r\n\r\n\"A young sparrow, about half grown, was placed under a bell-glass with a\r\n_Galeodes_; the moment the luckless bird moved, the spider seized him by\r\nthe thigh, which he speedily sawed off, in spite of the sparrow's\r\nfluttering; and then as the poor bird continued to struggle in pain, the\r\nsavage seized him by the throat, and soon put an end to his sufferings\r\nby cutting off the head. It did not, however, devour the bird, nor any\r\npart of it, but seemed satisfied with having killed it.\r\n\r\n\"On another occasion, I gave it a large garden-lizard, which was\r\ninstantly seized by the middle of the body; the lizard, finding that it\r\ncould not shake off its adversary, turned its head, and bit the\r\n_Galeodes_ on the leg, which obliged it immediately to quit its hold and\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\n\"On another occasion my friend, Dr Baddeley, confined one of these\r\nspiders in a wall-shade with two young musk rats (_Sorex Indicus_), both\r\nof which were killed by it.\"[161]\r\n\r\nIn an expedition to the Kurruckpoor Hills, south of Monghyr, Captain\r\nSherwill found upon the summit of Maruk, a table-topped hill of 1100\r\nfeet elevation, several of the gigantic webs of the Epeira spider, some\r\nof which measured (including the guy-ropes) from ten to twelve feet in\r\ndiameter, the reticulated portion being about five feet, in the centre\r\nof which the spider, of a formidable size and very active, sits waiting\r\nfor prey. \"The webs,\" he says, \"from their great strength, offered a\r\nsensible resistance when forcing our way through them. In the web of\r\none of the spiders we found a bird entangled, and the young spiders,\r\nabout eight in number, feeding upon the carcase. The bird was, with the\r\nexception of its legs and beak, entirely enveloped in the web, and was\r\nmuch decomposed; the entwined web had completely pinioned the wings of\r\nthe bird, so as to render its escape impossible. The bird was about the\r\nsize of a field-lark, and was near the centre of the web; the old spider\r\nwas about a foot above the bird: we secured, measured, and bottled him.\r\nIts dimensions were six inches across the legs, and it was armed with a\r\nformidable pair of mandibles.\"[162]\r\n\r\nIt is clear, then, that there is nothing absurd or contrary to\r\nprobability in the statement that spiders attack, overcome, and devour\r\nbirds. But Madame Merian is here again favoured with direct witnesses to\r\nsustain her good faith. M. Moreau de Jonnès expressly mentions, on his\r\nown authority, that the South American Mygale climbs the branches of\r\ntrees to devour the young of humming-birds. But the most satisfactory\r\nstatement is made by Mr H. W. Bates, who has recently returned from the\r\ninterior of Brazil after many years spent in studying the entomology of\r\nthat vast region. No one will deny his competency as a witness. \"Now I\r\nwill relate to you,\" he says, \"what I saw in the month of June 1849, in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Cameta. I was attracted by a curious movement of\r\nthe large gray-brown Mygale on the trunk of a vast tree: it was close\r\nbeneath a deep crevice or chink in the tree, across which this species\r\nweaves a dense web, open for its exit and entrance at one end. In the\r\npresent instance the lower part of the web was broken, and two pretty\r\nsmall finches were entangled in its folds; the finch was about the size\r\nof the common siskin of Europe, and I judged the two to be male and\r\nfemale; one of them was quite dead, but secured in the broken web; the\r\nother was under the body of the spider, not quite dead, and was covered\r\nin parts with the filthy liquor or saliva exuded by the monster. I was\r\non my return from a day's excursion by land at the time, with my boxes\r\nfull of valuable and delicate insects, and six miles from my house, and\r\ntherefore could not have brought the specimens home, even if I had\r\nwished, which I did not, as the spider was a very common species, easily\r\nto be procured nearer home. The species I cannot name; I sent several\r\nfine specimens, stuffed, to London, in 1851; it is wholly of a\r\ngray-brown colour, and clothed with coarse pile. Doubtless you will\r\nimmediately know the exact species to which I refer.\r\n\r\n\"If the Mygales did not prey upon vertebrated animals, I do not see how\r\nthey could find sufficient subsistence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIRD-EATING SPIDER.]\r\n\r\n\"On the extensive sandy campos of Santarem, so bare in vegetation, there\r\nare hundreds of the broad slanting burrows of the large stout species,\r\n(that fine one, dark brown with paler lines down the legs, of which I\r\nsent specimens in 1851.) The campos, I know, from close research, to be\r\nalmost destitute of insects, but at the same time to swarm with small\r\nlizards, and some curious ground finches of the Emberiza group (one of\r\nwhich has a song wonderfully resembling our yellow bunting of\r\nEngland), besides which, vast numbers of the _Caprimulgidæ_ and ground\r\ndoves lay their eggs on the bare ground.\r\n\r\n\"I believe this species of Mygale feeds on these animals and their eggs\r\nat night. Just at the close of day, when I have been hurrying home, not\r\nliking to be benighted on the pathless waste, I have surprised these\r\nmonsters, who retreated within the mouths of their burrows on my\r\napproach.\"[163]\r\n\r\n[142] _Brit.

This fascinating power has been most generally\r\nattributed to serpents, and is supposed to reside in a peculiar glare\r\nand fixity of the eyes, which appear to mesmerise the victims. If the\r\ngaze be interrupted, _on either part_, though but for a moment, it is\r\nsupposed that the spell is broken. Is there any such power? or is it\r\nmerely one of the many myths with which popular natural history is still\r\nburdened, and which it is the province of real science to explode? Let\r\nus gather together a few of the facts on which the opinion rests.\r\n\r\nI am not sure whether I ought to reckon as such the following statement,\r\nfor I do not know the value of the authority on which it rests. It is,\r\nhowever, sufficiently curious.\r\n\r\nDr Bird, a somewhat appropriate authority in this case, mentions an\r\nincident which happened in America. \"Two boys lighted by chance upon a\r\nlarge black snake; upon which one of them resolved to ascertain whether\r\nthe snake, so celebrated for its powers, could fascinate him. He\r\nadvanced a few steps nearer the snake, and made a stand, steadily\r\nlooking on him. When the snake observed him in that situation, he raised\r\nhis head with a quick motion, and the lad says, that at that instant\r\nthere appeared something to flash in his eyes, which he could compare to\r\nnothing more similar than the rays of light thrown from a glass or\r\nmirror when turned in the sun-shine; he said it dazzled his eyes; at the\r\nsame time the colours appeared very beautiful ... he felt as if he was\r\nin a whirlpool, and that every turn brought him nearer to the centre.\r\nHis comrade seeing him approach nearer to the snake, immediately ran and\r\nkilled it.\"[164]\r\n\r\nThere is, however, better authority than this for the belief in\r\nserpent-mesmerism. Professor Kalm states of the Rattlesnake of North\r\nAmerica, that it will frequently lie at the bottom of a tree on which a\r\nsquirrel is seated. The snake fixes his eyes upon the little animal, and\r\nfrom that moment it cannot escape: it begins a doleful outcry, runs up\r\nthe tree a little way, comes down again, then goes up, and afterwards\r\ncomes still lower. The snake continues at the bottom of the tree, with\r\nits eyes fixed on the squirrel; and its attention is so entirely taken\r\nup, that a person accidentally approaching may make a considerable\r\nnoise, without so much as the snake's turning about. The squirrel comes\r\nlower, and at last leaps down to the snake, whose mouth is already wide\r\nopen for its reception. The little animal then, with a piteous cry, runs\r\ninto its jaws and is swallowed.\r\n\r\nCatesby, though he says he never saw the phenomenon himself, reports the\r\nsame thing on the testimony of many witnesses, who all agreed that the\r\nanimals, particularly birds and squirrels, no sooner spy the snake than\r\nthey skip from spray to spray, hovering and approaching gradually nearer\r\ntheir enemy, regardless of any other danger; but with distracted\r\ngestures and outcries descend, though from the top of the loftiest\r\ntrees, to the mouth of the snake, who, opening his jaws, takes them in\r\nand in an instant swallows them.[165]\r\n\r\nMore recently Acrell tells the same story, as unquestionable. He\r\ndeclares that as the snake, who is the most indolent of all serpents,\r\nlies under the shade of a tree, opening his jaws a little, he fixes his\r\nbrightly-glittering eyes on any bird or squirrel which is in it. The\r\nsquirrel, uttering a mournful and feeble cry, leaps from bough to bough,\r\nas if seeking to escape, but presently, as if struck with the\r\nfascination, he comes down the tree, and flings himself, with a spring,\r\ninto the very jaws of his enemy. A mouse, shut up with a rattlesnake in\r\nan iron box, at first sat in one corner, the snake opposite to it. The\r\nreptile fixed its terrible eye on the little trembler, which at length\r\nthrew itself into the mouth of the serpent.[166]\r\n\r\nLawson affirms that _he has seen_ the phenomenon actually take place\r\nwith a squirrel and a rattlesnake.[167]\r\n\r\nI said that the belief is widely spread. We have seen it in North\r\nAmerica; we will now look at it in Africa.\r\n\r\nCaptain Forbes incidentally mentions a case analogous to these. Passing\r\nthrough some high grass at Ahomey, he observed, within an inch of his\r\nleg, a small lizard, with its eyes fixed. It did not move at his\r\napproach. At the same moment a cobra darted at it, and before he could\r\nraise his stick, bore the victim away. The captain naturally enough was\r\noccupied with his own narrow escape, and simply narrates the facts\r\nwithout comment; but the fixity of the gaze, and the motionlessness of\r\nthe lizard, were not a little remarkable.[168]\r\n\r\nMr Ellis, in his charming volume on Madagascar and the Cape, makes the\r\nfollowing observations:--[169]\r\n\r\n\"In a country abounding, as Africa does, with serpents, I expected to\r\nhear many anecdotes respecting them; and, conversing on one occasion\r\nwith Mr Pullen, a farmer who has lived many years in the country, and\r\nseemed to have paid rather more than usual attention to this species of\r\nreptile, he said he once saw a mouse running in a field, and that,\r\ncoming in sight of a snake, though at a considerable distance, it\r\ninstantly stopped. The snake fixed its eye on the mouse, which then\r\ncrept slowly towards the snake, and, as it approached nearer, trembled\r\nand shrieked most piteously, but still kept approaching until quite\r\nclose, when it seemed to become prostrate, and the snake then devoured\r\nit. On another occasion he had watched a snake capture a mouse in the\r\nsame manner; but, as it was retreating, he followed, and struck it on\r\nthe back with a stick, when it opened its mouth, and the mouse escaping,\r\nran for some distance, then fell down; but after a minute recovered and\r\nran away. Another time he said he watched a snake in the water, which\r\nhad fixed its eye on a frog sitting amongst the grass on the bank. The\r\nfrog, though greatly alarmed, seemed unable to stir, until Mr Pullen\r\ngradually pushed a rush growing near so that it intervened between the\r\neye of the snake and its intended victim, when the frog, as if suddenly\r\nliberated, darted away. Mr Pullen's ideas were in accordance with the\r\npopular notion, that the snake has the power of exercising some mesmeric\r\nor other influence through the steady fixing of its eye, and that\r\nwhatever intercepts this gaze breaks, as it were, the charm, and sets\r\nthe prisoner free.\"\r\n\r\nA most important witness on this matter is Dr Andrew Smith, the learned\r\nzoologist of South Africa, who thus soberly throws the weight of his own\r\nthoroughly competent and most conclusive personal observations into the\r\naffirmative scale. In his interesting account of the Boomslange, a\r\nserpent of considerable size found in that region, he says:--\r\n\r\n\"As this snake, _Bucephalus capensis_, in our opinion, is not provided\r\nwith a poisonous fluid to instil into wounds which these fangs may\r\ninflict, they must consequently be intended for a purpose different to\r\nthose which exist in poisonous reptiles. Their use seems to be to offer\r\nobstacles to the retrogression of animals, such as birds, &c., while\r\nthey are only partially within the mouth; and, from the circumstance of\r\nthese fangs being directed backwards, and not admitting of being raised\r\nso as to form an angle with the edge of the jaw, they are well fitted to\r\nact as powerful holders when once they penetrate the skin and soft parts\r\nof the prey which their possessors may be in the act of swallowing.\r\nWithout such fangs escapes would be common; with such, they are rare.\r\n\r\n\"The natives of South Africa regard the _Bucephalus capensis_ as\r\npoisonous; but in their opinion we cannot concur, as we have not been\r\nable to discover the existence of any glands manifestly organised for\r\nthe secretion of poison. The fangs are enclosed in a soft, pulpy sheath,\r\nthe inner surface of which is commonly coated with a thin glairy\r\nsecretion. This secretion possibly may have something acrid and\r\nirritating in its qualities, which may, when it enters a wound, occasion\r\npain and even swelling, but nothing of greater importance.\r\n\r\n\"The _Bucephalus capensis_ is generally found upon trees, to which it\r\nresorts for the purpose of catching birds, upon which it delights to\r\nfeed. The presence of a specimen in a tree is generally soon discovered\r\nby the birds of the neighbourhood, who collect around it, and fly to and\r\nfro, uttering the most piercing cries, until some one, more\r\nterror-struck than the rest, actually scans its lips, and, almost\r\nwithout resistance, becomes a meal for its enemy. During such a\r\nproceeding the snake is generally observed with its head raised about\r\nten or twelve inches above the branch round which its body and tail are\r\nentwined, with its mouth open and its neck inflated, as if anxiously\r\nendeavouring to increase the terror which it would almost appear it was\r\naware would sooner or later bring within its grasp some one of the\r\nfeathered group.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever may be said in ridicule of fascination, it is nevertheless\r\ntrue that birds, and even quadrupeds, are, under such circumstances,\r\nunable to retire from the presence of certain of their enemies; and,\r\nwhat is even more extraordinary, unable to resist the propensity to\r\nadvance from a situation of actual safety into one of the most imminent\r\ndanger. This I have often seen exemplified in the case of birds and\r\nsnakes; and I have heard of instances equally curious, in which\r\nantelopes and other quadrupeds have been so bewildered by the sudden\r\nappearance of crocodiles, and by the grimaces and contortions they\r\npractised, as to be unable to fly or even to move from the spot towards\r\nwhich they were approaching to seize them.\"[170]\r\n\r\nIt may have been the Boomslange to which Le Vaillant alludes, who says\r\nthat he saw, on the branch of a tree, a species of shrike, trembling as\r\nif in convulsions; and at the distance of nearly four feet, on another\r\nbranch, he beheld a large species of snake, that was lying with\r\noutstretched neck, and fiery eyes, gazing steadily at the poor animal.\r\nThe agony of the bird was so great, that it was deprived of the power of\r\nmoving away; and when one of the party killed the snake, the shrike was\r\nfound dead upon the spot, and that entirely from fear; for on\r\nexamination it appeared not to have received the slightest wound. The\r\nsame traveller informs us, that a short time afterwards he observed a\r\nsmall mouse, in similar agonising convulsions, about two yards distant\r\nfrom a snake, whose eyes were intently fixed upon it; and on frightening\r\naway the reptile, and taking up the mouse, it expired in his hand.[171]\r\n\r\nIn a record, by Mr D. T. Evans, of some experiments with Venomous\r\nSerpents, made at the Zoological Gardens, mainly with a view to test the\r\nefficacy of a reputed remedy for their bite,--_Simaba cedron_--and which\r\nwere pursued with the utmost philosophic care, we find the following\r\ninteresting particulars:--\"The attitudes and movements of the serpent\r\nintending to bite were very striking and beautiful. In the first place,\r\nhe made, with the posterior half of his body, a bold curve, having a\r\nstrong prehensile 'purchase' on the floor of the cage, so as to secure a\r\nsteady fulcrum for the rapid dart made at the time of the bite. The\r\nupper half of the body was raised some ten inches or a foot, the neck\r\nstrongly arched, and the head, bent at nearly right angles with the\r\nneck, was poised directly opposite the prey. In such position the\r\nserpent remained a greater or lesser time (sometimes as long as twenty\r\nminutes) according to circumstances. During this interval, the slightest\r\nmotion of the animal before him was followed by an instantaneous and\r\ncorrespondent movement of the head and neck of the serpent. The purpose\r\nseemed to be that of aim-taking, for the eyes were intently fixed upon\r\nthe prey; but I am by no means sure that the snake, knowing that the\r\nlatter cannot escape him, does not derive pleasure from this prolonged\r\nand intent gaze. At all events, in one experiment, where the head of a\r\nrattlesnake so engaged was sideways to the glass of the cage, and near\r\nit, I observed, and called attention to the fact, a remarkable\r\nvermicular motion along the course of the poison-gland to the opening of\r\nthe angle of the mouth, which we thought might afford him pleasure, and\r\nthis continued until the snake struck his prey.\r\n\r\n\"So far the Serpents. I now proceed to describe the peculiarities shewn\r\nby the animals on which we experimented. Some philosophers have denied\r\ninnate ideas to man; these and some others have furthermore denied an\r\ninstinctive apprehension of danger in animals. They say that of itself,\r\nas born, the hare has no dread of the hound: that its fear is acquired\r\nof experience. I concur in neither of these opinions, and think the\r\nlatter altogether refuted by the conduct of the animals exposed to\r\nserpents in these experiments. Not one of the guinea-pigs or rabbits\r\n(which were all something under their full growth) had ever seen a\r\nserpent; yet when introduced to the cage they shewed unequivocal\r\nsymptoms of distress and fear. In some instances they actually screamed\r\nbefore they were struck. They generally shewed restlessness at first,\r\nbut when the serpent, intending to strike, poised himself in front, they\r\nbecame for a time, if not altogether, motionless. Is there such a thing\r\nas 'fascination?' If by this is meant a pleasurable paralysis of the\r\nanimal's powers, I think it more than doubtful; but a deprivation of\r\nthe power of motion from terror may, perhaps, take place. All, however,\r\nthat I speak to is a perfectly motionless condition of snake and prey,\r\nlasting several minutes.\"[172]\r\n\r\nNor are there wanting examples of the same power exercised by the common\r\nSnake of our own country. I content myself with the following two, both\r\nof very recent record:--\r\n\r\n\"Up the hill above Tyneham,\" writes the Rev. Henry Bond, last August,\r\n\"towards the sea, I was struck by the shrill cry and fluttering\r\nagitation of a common hedge-sparrow, in a whitethorn bush. Regardless of\r\nmy presence, its remarkable motions were continued, getting, at every\r\nhop from bough to bough, lower and lower down in the bush. Drawing\r\nnearer, I saw a common snake coiled up, but having its head erect,\r\nwatching the sparrow; the moment the snake saw me it glided away, and\r\nthe sparrow flew off with its usual mode of flight.\"[173]\r\n\r\nThis anecdote brings out another by Mr John Henry Belfrage, of Muswell\r\nHill:--\"When proceeding down the avenue here one morning, at a turn in\r\nthe path I saw a robin, which appeared to me spell-bound, so much so as\r\nto allow a much closer approach than is usual even with that boldest of\r\nthe feathered tribe. On going nearer I perceived what I took to be the\r\ncause, in a large common snake, which was lying coiled up on one side of\r\nthe path, with its head a little raised. My appearance broke the spell,\r\nand the robin flew away; at the same time, the snake dropped its head\r\nand assumed a perfectly inert appearance.\"[174]\r\n\r\nA writer in the _Journal of the Indian Archipelago_ thus reports the\r\nmesmeric faculty exercised upon a certainly somewhat unlikely\r\nsubject:--\"On approaching an almost dry drain, I saw a snake slowly\r\nextending his coils, raising his head, and steadfastly gazing on what I\r\nsaw to be an eel of about a foot in length. The eel was directly\r\nopposite to the snake, and glance seemed to meet glance, when the snake,\r\nhaving the requisite proximity, darted on the eel and caught it about an\r\ninch behind the head, and carried it off; but the captor was soon\r\nhimself a captive, for with a blow on his head I secured both.\"[175]\r\n\r\nThe mystery is, as usual in such cases, attempted to be explained away.\r\nMan does not like mystery; scientific man least of all: it is humbling\r\nto the pride of science to be obliged to confess that there exists\r\nanything unaccountable to the initiated. Mr W. C. L. Martin thus\r\n\"explains\" the statements of Dr A. Smith, and all such accounts:--\"There\r\nis nothing mysterious in all this; the snake does not _mesmerise_ its\r\nprey, but merely so terrifies it as to stupify it; besides, the victim\r\nmay feel an impulse similar to that which urges many nervous persons on\r\nthe edge of a precipice, or top of a lofty tower, to throw themselves\r\ndown headlong, and which we have heard such describe as resisted with\r\ndifficulty; so may the panic-struck bird feel an impulse to rush into\r\ndanger which it might escape by flight.\"[176]\r\n\r\nAnd again:--\"Fear, amounting to panic, solicitude for its young, and\r\nefforts to drive away the dreaded intruder, leading the bird to venture\r\ntoo closely to the snake for its own safety, produce the results\r\nerroneously attributed to the Reptile's fancied power of fascination by\r\nits glance, or by some mystic property.\"[177]\r\n\r\nDr Barton, of Philadelphia, who, at the close of the last century,\r\npublished a memoir on the fascinating powers attributed to certain\r\nserpents, advocated the same views. He considered that in almost every\r\ninstance the supposed power was exerted on birds at the particular\r\nseason of nidification, and that the whole hypothesis originated in the\r\n[Greek: storgê] which prompts them to protect their eggs or young. No\r\ndoubt _some_ of the instances which have been reported as examples of\r\nfascination are capable of such an explanation, but surely not all; and\r\nthe fallacy, here again, as in so many parallel cases, lies in the\r\nadvocating of some theory which will cover a certain number of the\r\nfacts, and the ignoring of all such as will not be so accounted for. Is\r\nit to be supposed that Dr A. Smith could not distinguish between the\r\ncondition of involuntary paralysis of the faculties which he says he has\r\n_often_ seen, and the insane boldness of nesting birds? Had the mice,\r\nseen by Mr Pullen, had the frog, young ones to protect? Or the squirrel\r\nmentioned by Kalm? or the mouse seen by Le Vaillant? or the eel in the\r\ndrain? But what is the value of a hypothesis,--so far as its claims to\r\nsolve this question are concerned,--which will not touch these cases?\r\nWhen Mr Martin denies that there is anything mysterious in the matter,\r\nand in the same sentence admits that \"the victim may feel an impulse to\r\nrush into the danger which it might escape,\" he just yields the whole\r\npoint. I venture to affirm that this _is_ something mysterious,\r\nsomething totally unaccountable. I ask _what_, and _whence_, and _why_,\r\nthis strange impulse that overcomes the first of all instincts, the\r\nprime law of self-preservation?\r\n\r\nIt does not explain the cause of the phenomenon, though it possibly\r\nhelps us to determine its proper seat, to learn that fascination belongs\r\nto other animals besides the serpent tribes. We shall perhaps not err if\r\nwe conclude that the peculiarity resides not in the object, but in the\r\nsubject; that it is a mental emotion capable of being excited by objects\r\nhaving little in common except the death-terror which they excite. I\r\nhave no doubt that it is a phase of extreme terror; the singularity of\r\nthe phenomenon consists in the reversal of ordinary instinctive laws\r\nwhich it induces. My readers will probably be interested in the details\r\nof some cases in which the exciters of the emotion were animals other\r\nthan serpents. Here is one, apparently related with care and\r\ntruthfulness, though anonymous, in which the fascinator was as unlikely\r\nas can be well imagined to excite, and the fascinatee to feel, the\r\nemotion:--\r\n\r\n\"One evening, being seated in a room at Garrackpore, the window of which\r\nwas open, and the ceiling on one side sloped downwards towards the\r\nwindow, my attention was attracted by a butterfly which chanced to fly\r\ninto the room. I observed its motions for a minute or two, when I\r\nthought there was something that appeared unnatural in them, and the\r\ninsect began to dart to and fro in one direction, occasionally, however,\r\nvarying its flight about the room. I looked up to see what it could\r\npossibly be at, and instantly observed an ordinary-sized lizard on the\r\ncloth of the upper ceiling. I had not even then the most distant idea of\r\nwhat was really going on; but seeing the butterfly dart every now and\r\nthen at the lizard, I supposed it in play, till its motions became less\r\nquick and animated. The lizard remained all this time immovable, but at\r\nlast suddenly shifted its ground to the sloping part of the ceiling. The\r\nmotions of the butterfly became still more languid, until at length, to\r\nmy utter surprise, I saw the lizard open its mouth, and the butterfly\r\nflew directly into it. The lizard was about half a minute swallowing it,\r\nwings and all. Until the last act of this curious scene, though I well\r\nknew the lizard's object, I supposed it would probably make a leap at\r\nthe butterfly, yet had no idea of its succeeding, and expected to see\r\nthe butterfly fly away. Had I had an idea of the cause, I should have\r\nbroken the charm.\r\n\r\n\"From that moment I never had the least doubt of the power of\r\nfascination: that power I conceive to be _terror_, which, if the object\r\nwas sufficiently terrible, I believe would act equally on man or any\r\nother creature.\"[178]\r\n\r\nStill more strange is it to hear of scorpions fascinating blue-bottle\r\nflies! \"On my arrival\" says Mr Robert Hunter, \"at Nágpur, in Central\r\nIndia, in 1847, I requested that the first scorpion found in the house\r\nmight be allowed to live for a few minutes, that I might have an\r\nopportunity of observing its form and movements. In that part of India\r\none has rarely to wait long for such a visitant, and on an early evening\r\nmy colleague, the Rev. Mr Hislop, announced that there was a scorpion on\r\nthe wall. A lamp was set down on the floor, and we took convenient\r\nstations for noting what might pass. Just then a large fly, of the genus\r\nMusca, made its appearance, and soon became aware of the presence of the\r\nscorpion. A strong fury seemed to seize it, irresistibly impelling it to\r\nan insane attack on the terrible occupant of the wall: it flew at it\r\nwith all the little force it could muster, the scorpion meanwhile\r\nstretching out its lobster-like claw to catch it as it came. At the\r\nfirst charge, the fly rebounded from the crustaceous integument of its\r\nadversary, having done no more damage than if a child were to apply its\r\nhand to the well-mailed body of a cuirassier. It seemed amazed at its\r\nown audacity; and in a state of great apparent agitation wheeled round,\r\nand taking precipitately to flight, soon put two or three yards of safe\r\nspace between itself and its formidable but wingless foe. We now\r\nforcibly hoped 'the better part of valour' might be allowed to prevail.\r\nBut no! the tiny creature stood--it ventured to look--there glared still\r\nin view the malignant form. What could the poor animal do but make a\r\nsecond brilliant onset, in which it again eluded the outstretched claw\r\nof its enemy, and, as before, was successful in effecting a retreat?\r\n'Surely,' we mused, 'no further knight-errantry will be attempted: the\r\nmost exacting would consider this enough.' But we were mistaken. Again\r\nand again did the fly return to the combat, till in an unguarded moment\r\nit flew exactly into the open claw, which closing, rendered escape\r\nimpossible. The generosity of a Mouravieff was scarcely to be looked for\r\nin the scorpion, which, as will be readily believed, lost no time in\r\ndevouring its gallant captive. Possibly the fly may have been partly\r\ndazzled by the glare of the lamp. But undoubtedly it was in the main\r\nfascination, induced by the sight of the dread figure on the wall, that\r\nimpelled it to begin the unequal contest, which could terminate only in\r\nthe loss of its life.\"[179]\r\n\r\nAfter these cases, I fear my readers would see but little of the\r\nromantic in stories of stoats mesmerising hares and rabbits, or foxes\r\nparalysing pullets. The former are common enough,--the wretched hare\r\ncreeping along with a bewildered look, as if its back were broken, or\r\nscreaming in helpless immobility. I will confine myself to a single\r\nnarrative furnished by Mr Henry Bond, to whom this chapter is already\r\nindebted for one case. As he was walking on the hillside above West\r\nCreech Farm, in Penbeck, Somerset, last August, where the down is\r\nscattered with very low furze-bushes, his attention was arrested by a\r\ncry of distress. It proceeded from a rabbit which was cantering round in\r\na ring, with a halting gait. He watched it for some minutes; but, as\r\nthe circle became smaller, and the rabbit more agitated, he perceived a\r\nstoat turning its head with the rabbit's motion, and fixing its gaze\r\nupon it. He struck a blow at the stoat, but missed it; its attention was\r\nthus withdrawn from its intended victim, which instantly ran away with\r\ngreat vigour in a straight direction.[180]\r\n\r\nThis is a remarkably good case; the circular movement of the rabbit; the\r\never-diminishing circle; the rotation of the stoat; the fixity of its\r\ngaze; the liberation of the rabbit the moment the stoat was disturbed;\r\nand the instant recovery of its faculties on the breaking of the\r\nspell;--all these are circumstances of the highest interest in a case\r\navouched by so good a naturalist as Mr Bond.\r\n\r\nMr J. H. Gurney reports the account of a respectable gamekeeper, who,\r\nbeing much annoyed by the nightly visits of a fox to the poultry, could\r\nnot imagine how Reynard managed to effect his purpose, as they roosted\r\non a large spreading oak. One morning, however, just as day was dawning,\r\nhe heard a great noise among the poultry, and, looking out of the\r\nwindow, saw a fox running round and round under the place where they\r\nsat, and soon observed that the fowls began to fall from the tree in\r\ngreat confusion. The fox immediately seized his victim, and the mystery\r\nwas so far solved. A day or two afterwards the fox, a very large male,\r\nwas killed in an adjoining paddock, and no further assaults were made\r\nupon the poultry.\r\n\r\nIn this case the result was possibly effected by vertigo; the birds,\r\nbewildered and amazed in the dim light, followed with their eyes the\r\ncourse of the sly depredator, as he ran swiftly in a circle beneath,\r\nuntil the frequent turning of their heads made them giddy and unable to\r\nkeep their balance. _But how did the fox know that such a result would\r\nfollow?_\r\n\r\nThe same gentleman gives, from his own observation, a case that is more\r\nto the point. Here a bird is the mesmeric practitioner. \"I once saw a\r\ngolden eagle which appeared entirely to fascinate a rabbit that was put\r\ninto the large cage in which the eagle was kept. As soon as the rabbit\r\nwas introduced, the eagle fixed his eye upon it, and the rabbit intently\r\nreturned the gaze, and began going round the eagle in circles,\r\napproaching nearer each time, the eagle meanwhile turning on his axis\r\n(as it were) on the block of wood upon which he was seated, and keeping\r\nhis eye fixed upon that of the rabbit.\r\n\r\n\"When the rabbit had approached very near to the bottom of the eagle's\r\nperch, it stood up on its hind legs, and looked the eagle in the face;\r\nthe eagle then made his pounce, which appeared at once to break the\r\ncharm, and the rabbit ran for its life, but it was too late for it to\r\nescape the clutch of the eagle, and the instant death which followed\r\nthat tremendous squeeze.\"[181]\r\n\r\nI am not sure how far a parallelism exists between this animal\r\nfascination by the eye, and that attraction which fire is well known to\r\npossess for many creatures. Shelley sings of\r\n\r\n      \"The desire of the moth for the star,\"\r\n\r\nas if it were a romantic passion for that which is bright and beautiful.\r\nThis is, of course, a poet's aspect; the insect-collector, who wants to\r\nfill his cabinet--\"my friend the weaver,\" who nightly pursues his\r\n\"untaxed and undisputed game\"--well knows that the glare of his\r\nbull's-eye lamp will attract the moths by thousands on a damp night in\r\nJune. The little flitting atoms pass and repass across the field of\r\nlight, suddenly flashing into full radiance, and in an instant relapsing\r\ninto the darkness, unless his gauze net is too rapid for them. I have\r\noften sat reading late at night with a candle in the window, and\r\nobserved with interest how many insects of all orders will soon\r\ncongregate on the outside; now and then some large moth coming up with a\r\ndull _thud_, or a great mailed beetle dashing against the glass with a\r\ncrash that makes one look sharply up to see whether he has not cracked\r\nthe pane. In Jamaica I have taken many valuable beetles and other\r\ninsects around the candle-shades at an open window, which were not met\r\nwith in any other way.\r\n\r\nSo in Alabama, where it is customary in balmy autumn evenings for the\r\nfamily to sit in the yard under the broad sheltering trees, by the\r\nflickering light of the yard-fire. This fire is lighted at dusk on an\r\niron tripod breast-high, and kept up till bed-time. It is the duty of a\r\nnegro urchin to keep it constantly bright with splints of pine, so as to\r\nmaintain a perpetual blaze, as the object is to illuminate the yard and\r\nits contiguous offices. The little \"nigger\" nods, of course, but the\r\nloud scolding voice of master, mistress, or overseer, or any one else,\r\nrates him, and rouses him to duty, as soon as the flame falls. It is\r\npleasant to sit and watch the effect of the light, either transmitted\r\nthrough or reflected from the quivering leaves of the surrounding trees,\r\nthe blaze now rising brightly and playing in tongue-like flickering\r\nspires, now sinking and dying to a ruddy glow, then suddenly reviving\r\nunder the frightened watchfulness of the sable minister, who plays the\r\npart of vestal virgin at this altar.\r\n\r\nLarge insects often play around this fire. Beetles \"wheel their drony\r\nflight\" in buzzing circles round for a few turns, and are gone; and\r\nmoths come fluttering about, and often scorch their plumy wings. I have\r\ntaken some very fine Sphinges and other moths thus; and the only\r\nspecimen I ever saw of that very curious insect the Mole-cricket alive\r\n(a species distinct from, but very closely allied to, our European\r\ninsect) was one that suddenly dashed into the ashes of the\r\nlight-stand--a curious and interesting circumstance, when connected with\r\nthe opinion that I have before alluded to, that the _Gryllotalpa\r\nEuropæa_ is one of the producers of the _Ignis fatuus_.\r\n\r\nBirds also are attracted by light at night. I have read of a Titmouse\r\nthat was seen fluttering around a gas-lamp in the suburbs of London, and\r\nwould not be driven away; it at length made its entrance into the lamp\r\nthrough the orifice at the bottom, and continued to flit around and\r\nacross the jet. In 1832, a Herring-gull struck one of the mullions of\r\nthe Bell Rock Light-house with such force, that two of the polished\r\nplates of glass, measuring about two feet square, and a quarter of an\r\ninch in thickness, were shivered to pieces, and scattered over the floor\r\nin a thousand atoms, to the great alarm of the keeper on watch, and the\r\nother inmates of the house, who rushed instantly to the light-room. The\r\ngull was found to measure five feet between the tips of the wings. In\r\nhis gullet was a large herring, and in his throat a piece of plate-glass\r\nof about one inch in length.\r\n\r\nDr Livingstone gives some curious examples of the attractive power of\r\nfire over various creatures in South Africa, which he attributes to a\r\nsort of fascination. \"Fire,\" he says, \"exercises a fascinating effect on\r\nsome kinds of toads. They may be seen rushing into it on the evenings\r\nwithout ever starting back on feeling pain. Contact with the hot embers\r\nrather increases the energy with which they strive to gain the hottest\r\nparts, and they never cease their struggles for the centre, even when\r\ntheir juices are coagulating and their limbs stiffening in the roasting\r\nheat. Various insects also are thus fascinated; but the scorpions may be\r\nseen coming away from the fire in fierce disgust, and they are so\r\nirritated as to inflict at that time their most painful stings.\"[182]\r\n\r\n[164] _Peter Pilgrim._\r\n\r\n[165] _Hist. of Carolina._\r\n\r\n[166] _Amænit.

And\r\ndeservedly; for a venomous serpent is a terrible enemy: the direful\r\nvenom of sin injected by \"that old serpent, the Devil,\" is well\r\nsymbolised by the most potent of all lethic agencies,--the poison of the\r\nrattlesnake or the cobra.\r\n\r\nAnd yet in all ages there have been persons in the countries where the\r\nmost venomous snakes abound, who have professed, and have been believed\r\nto enjoy, an absolute immunity from their bites, and even to exercise\r\nsome inexplicable power over them, whereby their rage is soothed, and\r\nthey are rendered for the time gentle and harmless. The Holy Scriptures\r\nrepeatedly allude to this ancient art. The Magicians of Egypt, who\r\nturned their rods into serpents, are supposed to have had recourse to a\r\nsecret known, it is said, to the modern conjurors of the same country,\r\nwho, by pressing the nape of the neck of the cobra with their fingers,\r\nthrow it into a sort of catalepsy, by which its whole body becomes rigid\r\nlike a rod, and from which it is relieved by suddenly throwing it on the\r\nground. Aaron's rod was a veritable rod before and after the\r\ntransaction, but changed into a serpent by Divine miraculous energy:\r\ntheirs were serpents made to assume the appearance of rods for the\r\nmoment by a cunning device.\r\n\r\nOther and more direct allusions, however, occur to the art of\r\nserpent-charming. Thus the obduracy of the wicked is compared to \"the\r\ndeaf adder that stoppeth her ear; which will not hearken to the voice of\r\ncharmers, charming never so wisely.\"[183] And the Aseverity of the\r\nChaldean invaders is depicted under this imagery:--\"Behold, I will send\r\nserpents, cockatrices, among you, which will not be charmed, and they\r\nshall bite you, saith the LORD.\"[184]\r\n\r\nAmong the ancient Romans the Psylli, a people of Africa, and the Marsi,\r\na German tribe who had settled in Italy, were reputed to have the power\r\nof charming serpents, and to be endowed with immunity from the results\r\nof their venom. Celsus, however, maintains that this power consisted in\r\nan acquaintance with the fact, now well known, that animal poisons are\r\nhurtful only when mingled with the blood. They may therefore be taken\r\ninto the mouth with perfect impunity. With reference to so great an\r\nauthority, however, there is more in the art and mystery of\r\nserpent-charming than this.\r\n\r\nWhen Lucian describes the Babylonian magician as walking abroad, and\r\ncalling to him all the serpents that were near, with certain ceremonies,\r\nsuch as the utterance of sacred words from an ancient book, lustrations\r\nmade with sulphur and a torch, and solemn marchings in a circle, and\r\nwhen he asserts that the venomous reptiles, _nolentes volentes_,\r\npresented themselves harmless at his feet,--he describes a scene which\r\nis sufficiently familiar to European travellers in Egypt and India. And\r\nso, when Silius Italicus speaks of Atyr, instructed how to disarm\r\nserpents of their dire venom, and to lull to sleep the terrible\r\nwater-snakes with his magic touch, he refers, whether truly or falsely,\r\nto something of a more potent character than the feat by which Queen\r\nPhilippa saved the life of her royal husband.\r\n\r\nImmunity from the poison of serpents, and serpent-charming, are two\r\nthings. The former, so far as it depends on the natural law already\r\nmentioned, scarcely comes within the province of this work. But is there\r\nnot an innate immunity residing in some persons, and even in some\r\npeoples, by which, without the operation of any recognised natural law,\r\nor even any effort, they are securely protected either against the bites\r\nof venomous serpents, or, at least, against the fatality which is the\r\nordinary result of being bitten?\r\n\r\nThe Psylli, according to Pliny, were so characteristically endowed with\r\nthis immunity, that they made it a test of the legitimacy of their\r\nchildren; for they were accustomed to expose their new-born babes (only\r\nin doubtful cases, we may suppose) to the most venomous serpents they\r\ncould find; assured that if their paternity was pure Psyllic, they would\r\nbe quite unharmed. Of this tribe was the ambassador Hexagon, who,\r\nboasting of his power before the Roman consuls, submitted to the\r\ncrucial test which they suggested, of being inclosed in a vessel\r\nswarming with poisonous reptiles, which, says the legendary story, hurt\r\nhim not.\r\n\r\nThe same historian tells us that the Psylli, who formerly inhabited the\r\nvicinity of the Greater Syrtis,--that is, the modern Tripoli and\r\nBarca,--were conquered and almost exterminated by the Nasamones, who\r\npossessed their land; but that a remnant fled to some distant region. It\r\nis not improbable that the present inhabitants of Sennaar, on the south\r\nof Egypt, may be the lineal descendants of these same Psylli; for, since\r\nEgypt was densely peopled and highly cultivated, a barbarous tribe could\r\nscarcely have made good their footing there; and as on the other side\r\nwas the Great Desert of the Sâhra, and on the north the sea, there was\r\nno resource open to them but to creep along the desert edge of Egypt\r\ntill they found a thinly-inhabited land sufficiently savage to enable\r\nthem to form a settlement. The first region of this character that they\r\ncould possibly find would be Nubia; and there it is most interesting to\r\nknow that there exists a people at the present time, pretending to the\r\nsame powers as the old Psylli. Bruce, whose testimony, at first much\r\nimpugned, has come to be received with confidence, avouches that all the\r\nblack people in the kingdom of Sennaar, whether Funge or Nuba, are\r\nperfectly armed against the bite of either scorpion or viper. They take\r\nthe _Cerastes_--a little asp with two horns, of the most deadly\r\nvenom--into their hands at all times, put them into their bosoms, and\r\nthrow them at one another as children do balls, without ever irritating\r\nthem by this usage so much as to make them bite. One day when the\r\ntraveller was sitting with the brother of the prime minister of Sennaar,\r\na slave of his brought a _Cerastes_, which he had just taken out of a\r\nhole, and was using with every sort of familiarity. Bruce expressed his\r\nsuspicion that the teeth had been drawn, but was assured that they were\r\nnot, both by the slave and by his master, who, taking the viper from\r\nhim, wound it round his arm, and at the traveller's desire, ordered the\r\nservant to accompany him with it to his residence. Here Bruce, to test\r\nthe power of the serpent, took a chicken by the neck, and made it\r\nflutter; the seeming indifference of the snake immediately gave place to\r\neagerness, and he bit the fowl with great signs of anger, which died\r\nalmost immediately. Bruce considers that the indifference was only\r\nseeming towards the man,--that it was indeed powerlessness, for he\r\nconstantly observed that, however lively the snake was before, yet upon\r\nbeing seized by any of the blacks, it seemed as if taken with sudden\r\nsickness and feebleness, frequently shut its eyes, and never turned its\r\nmouth towards the arm of the person who held it.\r\n\r\nHow exactly this account agrees with the words of Silius,\r\n\r\n      \"---- _tactuque_ graves _sopire_ chelydros.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nubian traveller informs us that the Arabs--meaning apparently the\r\nMoslem blacks--have not this secret naturally, but that from infancy\r\nthey acquire an exemption from the mortal consequences attending the\r\nbites of all venomous reptiles by chewing a certain root, and washing\r\nthemselves (it is not _anointing_) with an infusion of certain plants in\r\nwater. This is by no means improbable; and it were much to be desired\r\nthat the root and the plants were obtained and identified, that their\r\npreventive powers might be tested by competent men of science. In all\r\nprobability they would be found to belong to the Quassia tribe, the\r\nnatural order _Simarubaceæ_, plants of the tropical regions of both\r\ncontinents, whose juices are of an intense bitterness. An infusion of\r\nthe chips of _Quassia amara_ and of _Simaruba amara_ is found to be an\r\neffectual poison to flies; and the Brazilian Indians use an infusion of\r\n_Simaruba versicolor_ as a specific against the bite of serpents, and\r\nuse it with great effect in the pediculous diseases which are so common\r\namong that people.\r\n\r\nIt was a plant of this order, _Simaba cedron_, on which experiments were\r\nmade a few years ago, at the Zoological Gardens, just before the\r\nlamentable death, by the bite of the Cobra, of poor Gurling, who,\r\nindeed, assisted in them. Mr Squire, the eminent chemist, was desirous\r\nof testing the powers of this plant, which, dried and reduced to powder,\r\nis in high repute among the Indians of South America as a serpentifuge.\r\nDr Quain and Mr Evans concurred in this desire; and, with the permission\r\nof the Zoological Society of London, a series of experiments, of much\r\ninterest, if not very conclusive in their results, were performed at the\r\nGardens, on the 8th July 1852.\r\n\r\nThe trials were made only on small animals, but in each case the alleged\r\nremedy proved inefficacious. The experimenters, however, think that it\r\nwould be unsafe to reject the _Simaba cedron_ as an antidote because it\r\nhere failed, inasmuch as death followed so rapidly that there was small\r\nopportunity for its action. It is not until it shall have been tried and\r\nhave failed upon stronger animals, that, in the face of the experience\r\nof the Indians in hot climates, it should be repudiated. The remedy was\r\napplied in the form of an infusion poured down the throat of the bitten\r\nanimal as quickly as possible after the stroke, and of the moistened\r\npowder applied to the wound. It seems to me worthy of consideration\r\nwhether, in the light of what Bruce says of the Nubians, a washing of\r\nthe body with the infusion, or an imbibition of it, or both, _before_\r\nthe serpent's attack, might not be more efficacious as a preventive\r\neither of the bite or of its results, than its administration afterwards\r\nas a cure. Whatever be the substance with which the Nubians wash\r\nthemselves, it seems to communicate to the body some quality, perhaps of\r\nodour, which repels and sickens serpents. Now, this may reside in the\r\nintense bitterness of the _Simarubaceæ_; and it would be worth while to\r\ntry whether a rattlesnake or a puff-adder would strike a guinea-pig that\r\nhad just been bathed in an infusion of the _Simaba_, or to which a dose\r\nof the same had just been administered, and if so, whether the bite then\r\nwould be fatal. Even if these experiments yielded no positive result, it\r\nwould still be open to consider whether the lapse of time, or a long\r\nsea-voyage, or exposure to our moist climate, may not have deprived the\r\npowdered root of the plant of antitoxic properties which it may have\r\npossessed when freshly prepared in its native region.\r\n\r\nTschudi, whose researches into the natural history of Peru are replete\r\nwith interesting and valuable information, has some observations on the\r\nnative remedies for serpent-bites which I will cite, prefacing the\r\nextract with a graphically terrible picture from his pen of the venomous\r\nreptiles themselves:--\r\n\r\n\"The serpents are to be feared; and, on approaching them, it is not easy\r\nto decide at the first view whether they belong to a poisonous or\r\ninnoxious species. In the forests, where the fallen leaves lie in\r\nthick moist layers, the foot of the hunter sinks deep at every step.\r\nMultitudes of venomous Amphibia are hatched in the half-putrescent\r\nvegetable matter; and he who inadvertently steps on one of these\r\nanimals may consider himself uncommonly fortunate if he can effect\r\nhis retreat without being wounded. But it is not merely in these places,\r\nwhich seem assigned by nature for their abode, that loathsome reptiles\r\nare found: they creep between the roots of large trees, under the\r\nthickly-interwoven brushwood, on the open grass-plats, and in the maize\r\nand sugar-cane fields of the Indians; nay, they crawl even into their\r\nhuts, and most fortunate is it for the inhabitants of those districts\r\nthat the number of the venomous, compared with the innoxious reptiles,\r\nis comparatively small. Of the poisonous serpents, only a few kinds are\r\nknown whose bite is attended with very dangerous consequences. The\r\nminamaru or jergon (_Lachesis picta_, Tsch.) is, at most, three feet\r\nlong, with a broad, heart-shaped head, and a thick upper lip. It haunts\r\nthe higher forests, while in those lower down his place is filled by his\r\nno less fearful relative, the flammon, (_Lachesis rhombeata_, Prince\r\nMax.,) which is six or seven feet in length. These serpents are usually\r\nseen coiled almost in a circle, the head thrust forward, and the fierce,\r\ntreacherous-looking eyes glaring around, watching for prey, upon which\r\nthey pounce with the swiftness of an arrow; then, coiling themselves up\r\nagain, they look tranquilly on the death-struggle of the victim. It\r\nwould appear that these Amphibia have a perfect consciousness of the\r\ndreadful effect of their poisonous weapon, for they use it when they are\r\nneither attacked nor threatened, and they wound not merely animals fit\r\nfor their food, but all that come within their reach. More formidable\r\nthan the two snakes just described, but happily much less common, is the\r\nbrown ten-inch-long viper (_Echidna ocellata_, Tsch.). It is brown, with\r\ntwo rows of black circular spots. The effect of its bite is so rapid\r\nthat it kills a strong man in two or three minutes. So convinced are the\r\nnatives of its inevitably fatal result, that they never seek any remedy:\r\nbut immediately on receiving the wound lay themselves down to die. In\r\nthe montanas of Pangoa this viper abounds more than in any other\r\ndistrict: and never without apprehension do the cholos undertake their\r\nannual journey for the coca harvest, as they fear to fall victims to the\r\nbite of this viper. The warning sound of the rattlesnake is seldom\r\nheard in the hot montanas, and never in the higher regions.\r\n\r\n\"Nature, who in almost all things has established an equilibrium,\r\nsupplies the natives with remedies against the bite of the serpent. One\r\nof the cures most generally resorted to is the root of the amarucachu\r\n(_Polianthes tuberosa_,[185] Linn.), cut into slips and laid upon the\r\nwound. Another is the juice of the creeping plant called vijuco de huaco\r\n(_Mikania huaco_,[186] Kunth), which is already very widely celebrated.\r\n\r\n\"This latter remedy was discovered by the negroes of the equatorial\r\nprovince Choco. They remarked that a sparrow-hawk, called the _huaco_,\r\npicked up snakes for his principal food, and when bitten by one it flew\r\nto the vejuco and ate some of the leaves. At length the Indians thought\r\nof making the experiment on themselves, and when bitten by serpents they\r\ndrank the expressed juice of the leaves of the vejuco, and constantly\r\nfound that the wound was thereby rendered harmless. The use of this\r\nexcellent plant soon became general, and in some places the belief of\r\nthe preservative power of the vejuco juice was carried so far that men\r\nin good health were inoculated with it. In this process some spoonfuls\r\nof the expressed fluid are drunk, and afterwards some drops are put into\r\nincisions made in the hands, feet, and breast. The fluid is rubbed into\r\nthe wounds by fresh vejuco leaves. After this operation, according to\r\nthe testimony of persons worthy of credit, the bite of the poisonous\r\nsnake fails for a long time to have any evil effect. Beside the two\r\nplants mentioned above, many others are used with more or less\r\nfavourable results. The inhabitants of the montana also resort to other\r\nmeans, which are too absurd to be detailed here: yet these medicines are\r\noften of benefit, for their operation is violently reactive. They\r\nusually produce the effect of repeated emetics and cause great\r\nperspiration. There is much difference in the modes of external\r\ntreatment of the wound, and burning is often employed. I saw an Indian\r\napply to his wife's foot, which had been bitten, a plaster consisting of\r\nmoist gunpowder, pulverised sulphur, and finely-chopped tobacco mixed up\r\ntogether. He laid this over the wounded part, and set fire to it. This\r\napplication in connexion with one of the nausea-exciting remedies taken\r\ninwardly had a successful result.\r\n\r\nAn English officer, engaged in the wars which freed the South American\r\nrepublics from the Spanish dominion, thus speaks of a plant which is\r\nprobably the same _Mikania_. His account is curiously confirmatory of\r\nthe accuracy of Bruce:--\r\n\r\n\"Among the many medicinal and poisonous plants growing on the banks of\r\nthe Orinoco, one of the most singular is a species of _vejuco_, which,\r\nwhen properly administered, proves a powerful preservative from the\r\neffects of poisonous serpents. It even appears to deprive these reptiles\r\neither of their power or inclination to use their fangs. Some of the\r\nleaves and small branches are pounded, and applied in that state as a\r\ncataplasm to both arms; the skin having been previously scarified freely\r\nabove the elbows. This species of inoculation is repeated, at stated\r\nintervals; the juice of the bruised plant, diluted with water, being\r\nalso occasionally drunk. Several soldiers, belonging to General Tedeno's\r\ndivision, had undergone this treatment, and frequently made the\r\nadvantage they had thus acquired useful on a march. They were thereby\r\nenabled to take shelter in deserted huts, which we dared not enter on\r\naccount of the snakes always lurking in such places; although these men\r\ncould bring them out in their hands, without sustaining any injury. As\r\nthey had been for some time in our company, we could ascertain that they\r\nhad not any snakes in their possession concealed for the purpose of\r\ndeception. Besides, they could have little or no inducement to practice\r\nan imposition upon us, as they neither asked for, nor expected, any\r\nreward for exhibiting their skill in destroying these reptiles.\"[187]\r\n\r\nAccording to Captain Forbes, the negroes of Dahomey employ a grass, or\r\ngrass-like herb, with success. One of his hammock-men had been bitten by\r\nvenomous snakes repeatedly, but, his father being a doctor, he had\r\nescaped injury. Walking one day through some long grass, the captain,\r\npointing to the bare legs of his servant, asked if there was not danger.\r\n\"None,\" said he; \"my father picks some grass, and if on the same day the\r\ndecoction is applied, the wound heals at once.\"[188]\r\n\r\nSome animals, especially those which prey upon serpents, seem to be\r\nproof against their bites. The Ichneumons or Mangoustes of Africa and\r\nAsia have long been celebrated for their immunity, and veritable stories\r\nhave been narrated of their having recourse to some herb, when bitten,\r\nafter which they successfully renewed the attack. Percival, in his\r\naccount of Ceylon, relates that a Mangouste placed in a close room where\r\na venomous serpent was, instead of darting at it, as he would ordinarily\r\nhave done, ran peeping about anxiously seeking some way of escape; but\r\nfinding none it returned to its master, crept into his bosom, and could\r\nby no means be persuaded to face the snake. When, however, both were\r\nremoved out of the house into the open field, the Mangouste instantly\r\nflew at the serpent, and soon destroyed it. After the combat the little\r\nquadruped suddenly disappeared for a few minutes, and again returned.\r\nPercival concludes, not unreasonably, that during its absence, it had\r\nfound the antidotal herb, and eaten of it. The natives state that the\r\nMangouste resorts on such occasions to the _Ophiorhiza mungos_, whose\r\nroot is reputed a specific for serpents' bites. This is a Cinchonaceous\r\nplant, so intensely bitter that it is called by the Malays by a name\r\nwhich signifies earth-gall.[189]\r\n\r\nCaptain Forbes in his interesting account of Dahomey, alludes to these\r\ncombats, which he says he has witnessed in India. He says that the\r\nserpent (Cobra) has usually the advantage at first, but the Mangouste\r\nretreating, devours some wild herb, returns and presently conquers.\r\n\r\nSir Emerson Tennent inclines to refer the immunity of the Mangouste to\r\nan inherent property. He remarks that the mystery of its power has been\r\n\"referred to the supposition that there may be some peculiarity in its\r\norganisation which renders it _proof against_ the poison of the serpent.\r\nIt remains for future investigation to determine how far this conjecture\r\nis founded in truth; and whether in the blood of the Mongoos there\r\nexists any element or quality which acts as a prophylactic. Such\r\nexceptional provisions are not without precedent in the animal economy:\r\nthe hornbill feeds with impunity on the deadly fruit of the _Strychnos_;\r\nthe milky juice of some species of _Euphorbia_, which is harmless to\r\noxen, is invariably fatal to the zebra; and the tsetse fly, the pest of\r\nSouth Africa, whose bite is mortal to the ox, the dog, and the horse, is\r\nharmless to man and the untamed creatures of the forest.\"[190]\r\n\r\nOur own hedgehog possesses the privilege of being unharmed by the venom\r\nof the viper, as is manifest in its frequent contests with it. Mr Slater\r\nhas frequently seen combats between these animals, which always\r\nterminated in favour of the hedgehog. The latter seemed perfectly\r\nregardless of the many bites it received on the snout.[191]\r\n\r\nTo return to Bruce's statements. After describing the little horned\r\nviper of Egypt, the _Cerastes_, and its insidious manner of creeping\r\ntowards its victim with its head averted, till within reach, when it\r\nsuddenly springs and strikes, he goes on to say: \"I saw one of them at\r\nCairo crawl up the side of a box, in which there were many, and there\r\nlie still as if hiding himself, till one of the people who brought them\r\nto us came near him, and though in a very disadvantageous posture,\r\nsticking, as it were, perpendicularly to the side of the box, he leaped\r\nnear the distance of three feet, and fastened between the man's\r\nforefinger and thumb, so as to bring the blood. The fellow shewed no\r\nsigns of either pain or fear, and we kept him with us full four hours,\r\nwithout his applying any sort of remedy, or seeming inclined to do so.\r\n\r\n\"To make myself assured\" (adds Bruce) \"that the animal was in its\r\nperfect state, I made the man hold him by the neck, so as to force him\r\nto open his mouth and lacerate the thigh of a pelican, a bird I had\r\ntamed, as big as a swan. The bird died in about thirteen minutes, though\r\nit was apparently affected in fifty seconds; and we cannot think this\r\nwas a fair trial, because a very few minutes before it had bit the man,\r\nand so discharged part of its virus, and it was made to scratch the\r\npelican by force, without any irritation or action of its own.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SNAKE-CHARMING.]\r\n\r\n\"I will not hesitate to aver,\" he adds, \"that I have seen at Cairo (and\r\nthis may be seen daily without trouble or expense) a man, who came from\r\nabove the catacombs, where the pits of the mummy-birds are kept, who has\r\ntaken a Cerastes with his naked hand from a number of others lying at\r\nthe bottom of the tub, has put it upon his bare head, covered it with\r\nthe common red cap he wears, then taken it out, put it in his breast,\r\nand tied it about his neck like a necklace, after which it has been\r\napplied to a hen and bit it, which has died in a few minutes;. and, to\r\ncomplete the experiment, the man has taken it by the neck, and beginning\r\nat its tail, has ate it, as one would do a carrot or a stock of celery,\r\nwithout any seeming repugnance.\"[192]\r\n\r\nA few years earlier than Bruce, Hasselquist, an enthusiastic young\r\nnaturalist, and one of the pupils of Linnæus, had visited the East. He\r\npaid much attention to the subject, and records his judgment that there\r\nis no delusion in serpent-charming, but that certain persons do really,\r\nin whatever way they effect it, fascinate serpents. \"They take the most\r\npoisonous vipers with their bare hands, play with them, put them in\r\ntheir bosoms, and use a great many more tricks with them, as I have\r\noften seen. The person I saw on the above day had only a small viper,\r\nbut I have frequently seen them handle those that are three or four feet\r\nlong, and of the most horrid sort. I inquired _and examined_ whether\r\nthey cut out the viper's poisonous teeth: but _I have seen with my own\r\neyes they do not_: we may therefore conclude, that there are to this day\r\nPsylli in Egypt; but what art they use is not generally known. Some\r\npeople are very superstitious; and the generality believe this to be\r\ndone by some supernatural art, which they obtain from invisible beings;\r\nI do not know whether their power is to be ascribed to good or evil; but\r\nI am persuaded that those who undertake it use many superstitions.\"\r\n\r\nSubsequently we find some details of interest. \"Now was the time (July)\r\nto catch all sorts of snakes to be met with in Egypt, the great heats\r\nbringing forth these vermin. I therefore made preparation to get as many\r\nas I could, and at once received four different sorts, which I have\r\ndescribed and preserved in _aqua vitæ_. These were the Common Viper, the\r\nCerastes of Alpin, the Jaculus, and an Anguis Marinus. They were brought\r\nme by a Psylle, who put me, together with the French consul, Sironcourt,\r\nand all the French nation present, in consternation.\r\n\r\n\"They gathered about us to see how she handled the most poisonous and\r\ndreadful creatures alive and brisk, without their doing or offering to\r\ndo her the least harm. When she put them into the bottle where they were\r\nto be preserved, she took them with her bare hands, and handled them as\r\nour ladies do their laces. She had no difficulty with any but the\r\n_Viperæ officinales_, which were not fond of their lodging. They found\r\nmeans to creep out before the bottle could be corked. They crept over\r\nthe hands and bare arms of the woman, without occasioning the least fear\r\nin her; she with great calmness took the snakes from her body, and put\r\nthem into the place destined for their grave. She had taken these\r\nserpents in the field with the same ease she handled them before us;\r\nthis we were told by the Arab who brought her to us. Doubtless this\r\nwoman had some unknown art which enabled her to handle those creatures.\r\nIt was impossible to get any information from her, for on this subject\r\nshe would not open her lips.\"\r\n\r\nHe thus sums up the results of his investigations. \"The circumstances\r\nrelating to the fascination of serpents in Egypt stated to me, were\r\nprincipally:--\r\n\r\n\"1st.--That the art is only known to certain families, who propagate it\r\nto their offspring.\r\n\r\n\"2d.--The person who knows how to fascinate serpents, never meddles with\r\nother poisonous animals; such as scorpions, &c. There are different\r\npersons who know how to fascinate these animals; and they again never\r\nmeddle with serpents.\r\n\r\n\"3d.--Those that fascinate serpents eat them both raw and boiled, and\r\neven make broth of them, which they eat very commonly amongst them; but\r\nin particular they eat such a dish when they go out to catch them. I\r\nhave been told that serpents, fried or boiled, are frequently eaten by\r\nthe Arabians, both in Egypt and Arabia, though they know not how to\r\nfascinate them, but catch them either alive or dead.\r\n\r\n\"4th.--After they have eaten their soup, they procure a blessing from\r\ntheir scheik, who uses some superstitious ceremonies, and, amongst\r\nothers, spits on them several times with certain gestures.\"\r\n\r\nThe blessing of the priest, Hasselquist pronounces correctly enough to\r\nbe mere superstition; we may fairly conclude that the eating of the\r\nsnakes is also irrelevant,--both of these circumstances being calculated\r\nto increase popular wonder only, and to lead the observers from the true\r\nscent, which probably is the employment of preventive simples.\r\nHasselquist had been told of a plant with which the charmers anointed\r\nor rubbed themselves before they touched the serpents; but, as no such\r\nplant was produced to him, he regarded it as fabulous. We have seen\r\nreason, however, to conclude that the real key to the mystery lies\r\nthere.[193]\r\n\r\nThe ancients believed that the human spittle was so fatal to serpents\r\nthat much of the secret of charming lay in the knowledge of this fact.\r\nOf course this would make Psylli of all men; but there may be this\r\nmeasure of truth in the supposition, that the natural exudations of a\r\nhuman body which has been bathed or rubbed with a penetrating\r\nalexipharmic, may be so impregnated with the odour, as to be peculiarly\r\nrepellent of the snake. Denham describes a scene of snake-charming in\r\nwhich the spittle played an important part. A juggler brought him in a\r\nbag two venomous snakes, which he set at liberty, beginning to beat a\r\nlittle drum. They immediately reared themselves on their tails, moving\r\nin a sort of dance. The juggler played various tricks with them,\r\nsometimes wreathing them round his neck, coiling them in his bosom, or\r\nthrowing them among the people. On pointing his finger at their mouth,\r\nthey immediately raised themselves in attitude to spring forward and\r\nstrike; but after having exasperated them to the utmost, _he had only to\r\nspit in their face_, to make them retreat quite crest-fallen. From his\r\ndescription these seem to have been of the genus _Naia_, upwards of six\r\nfeet long, and very venomous. The fangs, he says, had been extracted;\r\nbut still, to guard against all possible injury, the fellow who played\r\ntricks with them had a large roll of cloth wound round the right\r\narm.[194]\r\n\r\nThe influence of music on the serpents seems to be universally assumed\r\nas a part of the professional snake-charmer's success. The ancient\r\nPsylli who were employed to prevent the Roman camp from being troubled\r\nwith venomous serpents, marched around it, chanting mystic songs.[195]\r\nJohnson describes the very clever snake-catchers of India as pretending\r\nto draw them from their holes by a song, and by playing a plaintive tune\r\non an instrument somewhat resembling an Irish bagpipe.[196] He says,\r\nindeed, that this is all delusion; but Forbes, in his \"Oriental\r\nMemoirs,\" allows its reality. A learned native of India assured Sir\r\nWilliam Jones that he had frequently seen the most venomous and\r\nmalignant snakes leave their holes upon hearing notes from a flute,\r\nwhich, as he supposed, gave them peculiar delight.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian snake-charmer assumes an air of mystery, strikes the walls\r\nwith a short palm-stick, whistles, makes a clucking noise with his\r\ntongue, and says, \"I adjure you, by God, if ye be above, or if ye be\r\nbelow, that ye come forth; I adjure you by the most great Name, if ye be\r\nobedient, come forth, and if ye be disobedient, die, die, die!\"[197] The\r\nlate Dr W. A. Bromfield, in some extracts from his letters published in\r\nthe _Zoologist_,[198] confirms this:--\"The chief actor was a\r\nfine-looking man, with a handsome and intelligent, but peculiar cast of\r\ncountenance. He carried a stick in his hand, with which, on entering\r\neach apartment, he struck the wall several times, uttering, in a low,\r\nmeasured tone, a form of exorcism in Arabic; adjuring and commanding the\r\nserpent--which he declared, immediately on the door being thrown open,\r\nwas lurking in the walls or ceiling--to come forth. Presently, the\r\nreptile would be seen emerging from some hole or corner, with which\r\nevery room, even in the better class of Egyptian houses, abounds; on\r\nwhich the enchanter would draw the unwilling serpent towards him, with\r\nthe point of the stick, and when within reach put it in the bag he\r\ncarried about with him for that purpose.\"\r\n\r\nChateaubriand has drawn a graphic picture of the power of music on the\r\nAmerican Rattlesnake. The serpent happening to enter the encampment of\r\nhis party in Canada, a Canadian who could play on the flute, advanced,\r\nby way of diversion, with his magic pipe, against it. On his approach\r\nthe haughty reptile curled itself into a spiral line, flattened its\r\nhead, inflated its cheeks, contracted its lips, displayed its envenomed\r\nfangs, and its bloody throat; its double tongue glowed like two flames\r\nof fire; its eyes were burning coals; its body, swollen with rage, rose\r\nand fell like the bellows of a forge; its dilated skin assumed a dull\r\nand scaly appearance; and its rattle, which sounded the denunciation of\r\ndeath, vibrated with extreme velocity. The Canadian now began to play\r\nupon his flute: the serpent started with surprise, and drew back its\r\nhead. In proportion as it was struck with the magic effect, its eyes\r\nlost their fierceness, the vibrations of its tail became slower, and the\r\nsound which it emitted gradually became weaker and ceased. The folds of\r\nthe fascinated Serpent became less perpendicular upon their spiral line,\r\nexpanded by degrees, and sunk one after another upon the ground, forming\r\nconcentric circles. The colours recovered their brilliancy on its\r\nquivering skin; and, slightly turning its head, it remained motionless\r\nin the attitude of attention and pleasure. At this moment, the Canadian\r\nadvanced a few steps, producing with his flute sweet and simple notes.\r\nThe Reptile inclined its variegated neck, opened a passage with its head\r\nthrough the high grass, and began to creep after the musician, stopping\r\nwhen he stopped, and following him again as soon as he moved forward. In\r\nthis manner, to the astonishment both of Europeans and natives, he was\r\nled out of the camp; and it was unanimously decreed, that the life of a\r\ncreature so sensible of the concord of sweet sounds should be\r\nspared.[199]\r\n\r\nSome allowance in the colouring of this picture, which must be allowed\r\nto be beautifully painted, may possibly be made to the poetical\r\nimagination of the narrator, for Chateaubriand could not tell a story\r\nwithout embellishing it _suo more_. We may, however, accept the main\r\nfacts, confirmed as they are by the experience of other observers in\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\nMr Gogerly, a missionary of some standing in India observes that some\r\npersons who were incredulous on the subject, after taking the most\r\ncareful precautions against any trick or artifice being played, sent a\r\ncharmer into the garden to prove his powers;--the man began to play upon\r\nhis pipe, and proceeding from one part of the garden to another, for\r\nsome minutes stopped at a part of the wall much injured by age, and\r\nintimated that a serpent was within. He then played quicker, and his\r\nnotes were louder, when almost immediately a large Cobra di Capello put\r\nforth its hooded head, and the man ran fearlessly to the spot, seized it\r\nby the throat, and drew it forth. He then shewed the poison fangs, and\r\nbeat them out; afterwards it was taken to the room where his baskets\r\nwere left, and deposited among the rest. The snake-charmer, observes the\r\nsame writer, applies his pipe to his mouth, and sends forth a few of his\r\npeculiar notes, and all the serpents stop as though enchanted; they then\r\nturn towards the musician, and approaching him within two feet raise\r\ntheir heads from the ground, and bending backwards and forwards, keep\r\ntime with the tune. When he ceases playing, they drop their heads and\r\nremain quiet on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe _Penny Magazine_ for April 1833, contains the following very precise\r\nand circumstantial narrative, communicated by a gentleman of high\r\nstation at Madras:--\"One morning, as I sat at breakfast, I heard a loud\r\nnoise and shouting among my palankeen-bearers. On inquiry, I learned\r\nthat they had seen a large hooded snake, and were trying to kill it. I\r\nimmediately went out, and saw the snake creeping up a very high green\r\nmound, whence it escaped into a hole in an old wall of ancient\r\nfortification; the men were armed with their sticks, which they always\r\ncarry in their hands, and had attempted in vain to kill the reptile,\r\nwhich had eluded their pursuit, and in his hole had coiled himself up\r\nsecure, whilst we could see his bright eyes shining. I had often desired\r\nto ascertain the truth of the report, as to the effect of music upon\r\nsnakes. I therefore inquired for a snake-catcher. I was told there was\r\nno person of the kind in the village; but after a little inquiry, I\r\nheard there was one in a village distant about three miles. I\r\naccordingly sent for him, keeping a strict watch over the snake, which\r\nnever attempted to escape, whilst we, his enemies, were in sight. About\r\nan hour elapsed, when my messenger returned bringing a snake-catcher.\r\nThis man wore no covering on his head, nor any on his person, excepting\r\na small piece of cloth round his loins; he had in his hands two baskets,\r\none containing tame snakes, the other empty: these and his musical pipe\r\nwere the only things he had with him. I made the snake-catcher leave his\r\ntwo baskets on the ground, at some distance, while he ascended the mound\r\nwith his pipe alone. He began to play: at the sound of the music the\r\nsnake came gradually and slowly out of his hole. When he was entirely\r\nwithin reach, the snake-catcher seized him dexterously by the tail and\r\nheld him thus at arm's length; whilst the snake, enraged, darted his\r\nhead in all directions, but in vain: thus suspended, he has not the\r\npower to round himself, so as to seize hold of his tormentor. He\r\nexhausted himself in vain exertions; when the snake-catcher descended\r\nthe bank, dropped him into the empty basket, and closed the lid: he then\r\nbegan to play, and after a short time, raised the lid of the basket; the\r\nsnake darted about wildly, and attempted to escape; the lid was shut\r\ndown again quickly, the music always playing. This was repeated two or\r\nthree times; and in a very short interval, the lid being raised, the\r\nsnake sat on his tail, opened his hood and danced quite as quietly as\r\nthe tame snakes in the other basket, nor did he attempt again to escape.\r\nThis, having witnessed with my own eyes, I can assert as a fact.\"\r\n\r\nExperienced and skilful as these men are, however, they do not\r\ninvariably escape with impunity. Fatal terminations to these exhibitions\r\nof the psyllic art now and then occur, for there are still to be found\r\n\"deaf adders, which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming\r\nnever so wisely.\" In Madras, a few years ago, a noted serpent-charmer\r\nchanced one morning to get hold of a Cobra of considerable size, which\r\nhe got conveyed to his home. He was occupied abroad all day, and had not\r\ntime to get the dangerous fangs extracted from the Serpent's mouth. This\r\nat least is the probable solution of the matter. In the evening he\r\nreturned to his dwelling, considerably excited with liquor, and began to\r\nexhibit tricks with his snakes to various persons who were around him at\r\nthe time. The newly-caught Cobra was brought out with the others, and\r\nthe man, spirit-valiant, commenced to handle the stranger like the rest.\r\nBut the Cobra darted at his chin, and bit it, making two marks like pin\r\npoints. The poor juggler was sobered in an instant. \"I am a dead man,\"\r\nhe exclaimed. The prospect of immediate death made the maintenance of\r\nhis professional mysticism a thing of no moment. \"Let the creature\r\nalone,\" said he to those about him, who would have killed the Cobra; \"it\r\nmay be of service to others who are of my trade. To me it can be of no\r\nmore use. Nothing can save me.\" His professional knowledge was but too\r\naccurate. In two hours he was a corpse! The narrator saw him a short\r\ntime after he died. His friends and brother jugglers had gathered around\r\nhim, and had him placed on a chair in a sitting position. Seeing the\r\ndetriment likely to result to their trade and interests from such a\r\nnotion, they vehemently asserted that it was not the envenomed bite\r\nwhich had killed him. \"No, no; he only forgot one little word--one small\r\nportion of the charm.\" In fact, they declared that he was not dead at\r\nall, but only in a sort of swoon, from which, according to the rules of\r\nthe cabalistic art, he would recover in seven days. But the officers of\r\nthe barracks, close to which the deceased had lived, interfered in the\r\nmatter. They put a guard of one or two men on the house, declaring that\r\nthey would allow the body to remain unburied for seven days, but would\r\nnot permit any trickery. Of course the poor serpent-charmer never came\r\nto life again. His death, and the manner of it, gave a severe blow, as\r\nhas been already hinted, to the art and practice of snake-charming in\r\nMadras.\r\n\r\nRoberts also mentions the instance of a man who came to a gentleman's\r\nhouse to exhibit tame snakes, and on being told that a Cobra, or Hooded\r\nSnake was in a cage in the house, was asked if he could charm it; on his\r\nreplying in the affirmative, the Serpent was released from the cage,\r\nand, no doubt, in a state of high irritation. The man began his\r\nincantations, and repeated his charms, but the Snake darted at him,\r\nfastened upon his arm, and before night he was a corpse.\r\n\r\nThese failures, rare and abnormal as they confessedly are, do not by any\r\nmeans disprove the reality of snake-charming; they certainly shew that\r\nthe men believe in their own powers. It may be, as some Europeans have\r\nmaintained, that in India, the exhibitors usually practise upon tame\r\nsnakes, from which they have already extracted the fangs, or even\r\neradicated the poison sacs,--an operation performed without difficulty\r\nby making an incision beneath and behind each eye. Or it may be that the\r\npower of music over these reptiles is ordinarily relied on, and that in\r\nrare instances this fails. I have myself taken fierce and active\r\nlizards, in Jamaica, by a noose of string, while whistling a lively\r\ntune. As soon as the whistling commenced, the lizard would become still\r\non the trunk or the branch of a tree, and so remain unmoved, with a\r\nsleepy look all the while I was searching up the string, preparing the\r\nnoose, and presenting it to him, giving just a backward glance of his\r\neye, as the noose slipped over his head, the whistling going on\r\nvigorously all the time, of course, till the cord being jerked tight, he\r\nsuddenly found himself dangling in the air at the end of a stick, and\r\nbegan to wriggle and writhe, and scratch and bite furiously.\r\n\r\nOne thing seems clear from these accidents. The Indian _samp-wallahs_ do\r\nnot use any infusion or unguent to stupefy and disarm their snakes, as\r\ndo those of Ethiopia. If these men just mentioned had been so protected\r\nthey would not have been killed, however rash or pot-valiant they might\r\nhave been. Indeed the accounts of Bruce and others of the African\r\nprofessors of the psyllic art, and the phenomena of the serpents acted\r\nupon, differ greatly from descriptions of parallel exhibitions in India,\r\nand suggest diverse modes of explanation.\r\n\r\nA dozen years ago there were a couple of oriental Psylli performing at\r\nthe Zoological Gardens. Mr Brodcrip has given a very graphic sketch of\r\ntheir performance as he saw it in the Reptile House. The two Arabs took\r\nup their position on the floor, the company standing in a semicircle at\r\na respectful distance.\r\n\r\n\"The old Arab said something to the young one, who stooped down ... and\r\ntook out a large deal-box, drew off the cover, thrust in his hand and\r\npulled out a large long _Naia haje_ (the Egyptian species of Cobra).\r\nAfter handling it and playing with it a little while, he set it down on\r\nthe floor, half squatted close to it, and fixed his eyes on the snake.\r\nThe serpent instantly raised itself, expanded its hood, and turned\r\nslowly on its own axis, following the eye of the young Arab, turning as\r\nhis head, or eye, or body turned. Sometimes it would dart at him, as if\r\nto bite. He exercised the most perfect command over the animal. All this\r\ntime the old Arab stood still, pensively regarding the operation; but\r\npresently he also squatted down, muttering some words, opposite to the\r\nsnake. He evidently affected the reptile more strongly than his more\r\nmercurial relative, though he remained motionless, doing nothing that I\r\ncould see but fixing his eyes upon the snake, with his face upon a level\r\nwith the raised head of the serpent, which now turned all its attention\r\nto him, and seemed to be in a paroxysm of rage. Suddenly it darted\r\nopen-mouthed at his face, furiously dashing its expanded whitish-edged\r\njaws into the dark hollow cheek of the charmer, who still imperturbably\r\nkept his position, only smiling bitterly at his excited antagonist. I\r\nwas very close, and watched very narrowly; but though the snake dashed\r\nat the old Arab's face and into it more than twice or thrice with its\r\nmouth wide open, I could not see the projection of any fang.\r\n\r\n\"Then the old Arab, who, it was said, had had the gift of charming\r\nserpents in his family for a long series of years, opened another box,\r\nand took out four or five great lizards, and provoked the Naia with\r\nthem, holding them by the tails in a sort of four-in-hand style. Then\r\nthe youth brought out a Cerastes, which I observed seemed overpowered,\r\nas if, as the country people say, something had come over it. He placed\r\nit on the floor; but this serpent did not raise itself like the Naia,\r\nbut, as the charmer stooped to it, moved in a very odd, agitated manner,\r\non its belly, regarding him askant. I thought the serpent was going to\r\nfly at the lad, but it did not. He took it up, played with it, blew or\r\nspit at it, and then set it down apparently sick, subdued, and limp. He\r\nthen took it again, played with it a second time, gathered it up in his\r\nhand, put it in his bosom, went to another box, drew the lid, and\r\nbrought out more snakes, one of which was another Naia, and the others\r\nof a most venomous kind.\r\n\r\n\"Now there were two Naias, with heads and bodies erect, obeying,\r\napparently, the volition of the charmers. One of the snakes bit the\r\nyouth on the naked hand, and brought blood; but he only spat on the\r\nwound and scratched it with his nail which made the blood flow more\r\nfreely. Then he brought out more lizards of a most revolting aspect. By\r\nthis time the floor of the reptile house, that formed the stage of the\r\ncharmers, began to put one in mind of the incantation-scene in _Der\r\nFreischutz_, only that the principal performers looked more like the\r\nBlack Huntsman and one of his familiars than Max and Caspar, and the\r\nenchanters' circle was surrounded with fair ladies and their\r\nwell-dressed lords, instead of the appalling shapes which thronged round\r\nthe affrighted huntsman at the casting of the charmed bullets.\r\n\r\n\"The Arabs, holding the snakes by the tails, let their bodies touch the\r\nfloor, when they came twisting and wriggling on towards the spectators,\r\nwho now backed a little upon the toes of those who pressed them from\r\nbehind. Sometimes the charmers would loose their hold, when the\r\nserpents, as if eager to escape from their tormentors, rapidly advanced\r\nupon the retreating ring; but they always caught them by the tails in\r\ntime, and then made them repeat the same advances. I kept my position in\r\nfront throughout, and had no fear, feeling certain that Mr Mitchell,\r\nand those under whose superintendence this highly amusing and\r\ninstructive establishment is so well conducted, would not have permitted\r\nthe exhibition to take place, if there had been the least danger.\r\nBesides this, I observed that the charmers only used their own serpents,\r\nwhich they had, I presume, brought with them; and I confess that the\r\nimpression upon my mind was, that they had been rendered innoxious by\r\nmechanical means.\"[200]\r\n\r\nThis last assumption the narrator subsequently found to be indubitably\r\ntrue. What is said of the _Cerastes_, however, looks more like the\r\neffect of something detrimental to the snake in the lad's odour, or in\r\nhis spittle. Of course no confidence can be placed in their statements,\r\nbut it is noteworthy that they both claimed to belong to a race over\r\nwhom snakes have no morbific power,--Psylli, in fact, of many\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nDr Davy asserts that in India, however, the poison fangs are _not_\r\nextracted. He tells us that he has himself examined the snakes exhibited\r\n(which are always Cobras) and have found the fangs uninjured. He\r\nattributes the power of the charmers to their agility and courage,\r\nfounded on an intimate acquaintance with the habits and disposition of\r\nthe reptiles. The learned Doctor acting on this persuasion, says that he\r\nhas himself repeatedly irritated these serpents with impunity. They can\r\nbe readily appeased when irritated, by the voice and by gentle movements\r\nof the hand in a circle, and by stroking them on the body.\r\n\r\nA very curious subject, closely connected with serpent-charming, is the\r\npower of extracting venom from a wound inflicted by reptiles, attributed\r\nto the \"snake-stone,\" which the Hindoos and Cingalese usually carry with\r\nthem. Captain Napier thus describes it:--\r\n\r\n\"These people generally have for sale numbers of _snake-stones_, which\r\nare said to be equally an antidote against the bite of the serpent and\r\nthe sting of the scorpion. For the former I have never seen it tried:\r\nand to prove its efficacy with the latter, the samp-wallah generally\r\ncarries about in small earthen vessels a number of these animals, one of\r\nwhich he allows to wound him with his sting. The snake-stone, which is a\r\ndark, shining, smooth pebble, about the size and shape of a French bean,\r\non being applied to the wound, instantly adheres to it, and by a power\r\nof suction appears to draw out the poison, which is supposed to be\r\ncontained in the small bubbles which, on the immersion of the stone into\r\na glass of water are seen in great numbers to rise to the surface.\r\n\r\n\"My first idea on beholding the samp-wallah allow himself to be stung by\r\nthe scorpion was that the latter had by some means been rendered\r\nharmless. However, not wishing voluntarily to put this to the test by\r\npersonal experience, I purchased some of the stones, resolved on the\r\nvery first opportunity to try their efficacy. Shortly after this,\r\nhappening to be marching up the country with a detachment, we pitched\r\nour camp on some very stony ground, in clearing which one of the English\r\nsoldiers happened to be bit [stung] in the hand by a large scorpion. As\r\nsoon as I heard of this circumstance, I sent for the sufferer, who\r\nappeared to be in great pain, which he described as a burning sensation\r\nrunning all the way up his arm to the very shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"I applied one of the snake-stones to the puncture; it adhered\r\nimmediately, and during about eight minutes that it remained on the\r\npatient, he by degrees became easier; the pain diminished, gradually\r\ncoming down from the shoulder, until it appeared entirely confined to\r\nthe immediate vicinity of the wound. I now removed the stone; on putting\r\nit into a cup of water, numbers of small air-bubbles rose to the\r\nsurface, and in a short time the man ceased to suffer any inconvenience\r\nfrom the accident.\"[201]\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely needful to say that the emission of bubbles is a most\r\nordinary phenomenon, and could have not the slightest connexion with the\r\nalexipharmic power of the stone, whether real or imaginary. Any one may\r\nsee exactly the same thing on dropping a bit of new flower-pot, or a\r\nvery dry brick into water, or any other substance heavier than the\r\nfluid, which is at the same time dry and porous. It results from the air\r\nwhich is contained in the pores of the material, which on immersion is\r\ndisplaced by the heavier water, and rises in oozing bubbles to the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nSir Emerson Tennent has some observations of much value on these\r\n\"stones,\" as well as on cognate matters, which my readers may like to\r\nsee, and with which I close this subject:--\r\n\r\n\"On one occasion, in March 1854, a friend of mine was riding, with some\r\nother civil officers of the government, along a jungle-path in the\r\nvicinity of Bintenne, when they saw one of two Tamils, who were\r\napproaching them, suddenly dart into the forest and return, holding in\r\nboth hands a _cobra di capello_ which he had seized by the head and\r\ntail. He called to his companion for assistance to place it in their\r\ncovered basket, but in doing this, he handled it so inexpertly that it\r\nseized him by the finger, and retained its hold for a few seconds, as if\r\nunable to retract its fangs. The blood flowed, and intense pain appeared\r\nto follow almost immediately; but, with all expedition, the friend of\r\nthe sufferer undid his waistcloth, and took from it two snake-stones,\r\neach of the size of a small almond, intensely black and highly polished,\r\nthough of an extremely light substance. These he applied one to each\r\nwound inflicted by the teeth of the serpent, to which the stones\r\nattached themselves closely, the blood that oozed from the bites being\r\nrapidly imbibed by the porous texture of the article applied. The stones\r\nadhered tenaciously for three or four minutes, the wounded man's\r\ncompanion in the meanwhile rubbing his arm downwards from the shoulder\r\ntowards the fingers. At length the snake-stones dropped off of their own\r\naccord; the suffering appeared to have subsided; he twisted his fingers\r\ntill the joints cracked, and went on his way without concern. Whilst\r\nthis had been going on, another Indian of the party who had come up\r\ntook from his bag a small piece of white wood, which resembled a root,\r\nand passed it gently near the head of the cobra, which the latter\r\nimmediately inclined close to the ground; he then lifted the snake\r\nwithout hesitation, and coiled it into a circle at the bottom of his\r\nbasket. The root, by which he professed to be enabled to perform this\r\noperation with safety, he called the _Naya-thalee Kalinga_ (the root of\r\nthe snake-plant,) protected by which he professed his ability to\r\napproach any reptile with impunity. In another instance, in 1853, Mr\r\nLavalliere, the District Judge of Kandy, informed me that he saw a\r\nsnake-charmer in the jungle, close by the town, search for a _cobra di\r\ncapello_, and, after disturbing it in its retreat, the man tried to\r\nsecure it, but, in the attempt, he was bitten in the thigh till blood\r\ntrickled from the wound. He instantly applied the _Pamboo-Kaloo_ (or\r\nsnake-stone), which adhered closely for about ten minutes, during which\r\ntime he passed the root which he held in his hand backwards and forwards\r\nabove the stone, till the latter dropped to the ground. He assured Mr\r\nLavalliere that all danger was then past. That gentleman obtained from\r\nhim the snake-stone he had relied on, and saw him repeatedly afterwards\r\nin perfect health. The substances which were used on both these\r\noccasions are now in my possession. The roots employed by the several\r\nparties are not identical. One appears to be a bit of the stem of an\r\n_Aristolochia_; the other is so dry as to render it difficult to\r\nidentify it, but it resembles the quadrangular stem of a jungle vine.\r\nSome species of _Aristolochia_, such as the _A. serpentaria_ of North\r\nAmerica, are supposed to act as a specific in the cure of snake-bites;\r\nand the _A. Indica_ is the plant to which the ichneumon is popularly\r\nbelieved to resort as an antidote when bitten; but it is probable that\r\nthe use of any particular plant by the snake-charmers is a pretence, or\r\nrather a delusion, the reptile being overpowered by the resolute action\r\nof the operator, and not by the influence of any secondary appliance,\r\nthe confidence inspired by the supposed talisman enabling its possessor\r\nto address himself fearlessly to his task, and thus to effect by\r\ndetermination and will, what is popularly believed to be the result of\r\ncharms and stupefaction.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer then alludes to the facts mentioned by Bruce, which I have\r\nbefore adduced; and proceeds:--\r\n\r\n\"As to the snake-stone itself, I submitted one, the application of which\r\nI have been describing, to Mr Faraday, and he has communicated to me, as\r\nthe result of his analysis, his belief that it is 'a piece of charred\r\nbone which has been filled with blood perhaps several times, and then\r\ncarefully charred again. Evidence of this is afforded, as well by the\r\napertures of cells or tubes on its surface as by the fact that it yields\r\nand breaks under pressure, and exhibits an organic structure within.\r\nWhen heated slightly, water rises from it, and also a little ammonia;\r\nand, if heated still more highly in the air, the carbon burns away, and\r\na bulky white ash is left, retaining the shape and size of the 'stone.'\r\nThis ash, as is evident from inspection, cannot have belonged to any\r\nvegetable substance, for it is almost entirely composed of phosphate of\r\nlime. Mr Faraday adds that 'if the piece of matter has ever been\r\nemployed as a spongy absorbent, it seems hardly fit for that purpose in\r\nits present state; but who can say to what treatment it has been\r\nsubjected since it was fit for use, or to what treatment the natives may\r\nsubmit it when expecting to have occasion to use it?'\"\r\n\r\nSir E. Tennent supposes that the animal charcoal may be sufficiently\r\nabsorbent to extract the venom from the recent wound together with a\r\nportion of the blood, before it has had time to be carried into the\r\nsystem. If this be so the process is analogous to that of sucking a\r\npoisoned wound, already referred to.[202]\r\n\r\nWhat the author means by a jungle vine I do not exactly know, but\r\nconjecture that it may be one of the _Bignoniaceæ_, the woody climbing\r\nspecies of which have in general their stem divided into lobes arranged\r\nin a quadrangular manner. I am not aware that any species of this order\r\nis an antidote to animal poisons, but many have powerful medicinal\r\nproperties, and abound in bitter juices. The whitewood of Jamaica\r\n(_Bignonia leucoxylon_) enjoys a reputation as a remedy for the poison\r\nof the Manchineel (_Hippomane mancinella_) which is so virulent that\r\npersons are reported to have been killed by its volatile emanations,\r\nwhen accidentally sleeping under its shade, and a drop of its juice\r\nfalling on the skin burns it like fire, and produces an ulcer difficult\r\nto heal. The value of the _Aristolochia_ has been already referred to;\r\nand on the whole I am disposed to attach more importance to the use of\r\nvegetable specifics by the Ceylonese operators than the learned author\r\nwhom I have just quoted. The subject is a highly curious one, and well\r\nworthy of minute investigation by able and unprejudiced men of science,\r\nwilling to receive unscientific information and suggestions, in various\r\nparts of the world, particularly in the intertropical regions of both\r\nhemispheres.\r\n\r\n[183] Psalm lviii. 4, 5.\r\n\r\n[184] Jer. viii. 17.\r\n\r\n[185] This is the Tuberose, a liliaceous plant, so commonly cultivated\r\nin our conservatories. It is generally stated to be a native of the East\r\nIndies, but the one spoken of by Tschudi, with a Peruvian name, must\r\ncertainly be an indigenous plant of the country.\r\n\r\n[186] The genus _Mikania_ of Willdenow is one of the tubuliflorous\r\n_Asteraceæ_. _M. guaco_ Humboldt mentions, under the name of Vijuco del\r\nGuaco, as being highly esteemed in South America as a valuable antidote\r\nagainst the bite of serpents. \"Guaco\" and \"huaco\" are the same word, the\r\nintensity of the aspirate varying among different peoples. The power of\r\nthis _Mikania_ is denied in the most positive terms by Hancock, who\r\nsuspects that the real Guaco antidote is some kind of _Aristolochia_.\r\nThe word \"Vijuco\" or \"Bejuco,\" in Tropical America, signifies any\r\nclimbing plant, and is equivalent to our florist word \"creeper.\"\r\n\r\n_Eupatorium ayapana_, belonging to the same order as _Mikania_, is a\r\nvaluable repellent of the poison of venomous snakes. For this purpose it\r\nis used in Brazil. A quantity of the bruised leaves, which are to be\r\nfrequently changed, is laid on the scarified wound, and some spoonfuls\r\nof the expressed juice are from time to time administered to the\r\npatient, till he is found to be free from the symptoms, especially the\r\ndreadful anxiety which follows the wounds of venomous reptiles. _E.\r\nperfoliatum_ has a very similar action, and _Mikania opifera_ is\r\nemployed in the same way.--(_Lindley's Veg. Kingd._, p. 707.) These\r\nfacts tend to confirm the accuracy of Tschudi and Humboldt against\r\nHancock.\r\n\r\n[187] _Campaigns and Cruises in Venezuela_, vol. i., p. 43.\r\n\r\n[188] _Dahomey and the Dahomans._\r\n\r\n[189] Several of the _Aristolochieæ_--plants generally having a very\r\nbitter taste, and a strong, pungent, disagreeable smell--are valuable\r\nalexipharmics. There is a plant very common in Jamaica, where it is\r\ncalled snake-withe, trailing over the stone fences, which I suspect to\r\nbe an _Aristolochia_, and perhaps _A. trilobata_; it is employed as a\r\nsudden and potent sudorific, and as an antidote to serpent-bites in\r\nother countries, for in Jamaica there is no venomous reptile. The _A.\r\nanguicida_ of Carthagena is described by Jacquin as fatal to serpents.\r\nHe says that the juice of the root chewed and introduced into the mouth\r\nof a serpent so stupefies it that it may be for a long time handled with\r\nimpunity: if the reptile is compelled to swallow a few drops, it\r\nperishes in convulsions. The root is also reputed to be an antidote to\r\nserpent-bites. \"It is not a little remarkable,\" observes Dr Lindley,\r\n\"that the power of stupefying snakes, ascribed in Carthagena to\r\n_Aristolochia anguicida_, should be also attributed to _A. pallida_,\r\n_longa_, _b{oe}tica_, _sempervirens_ and _rotunda_; which are said to be\r\nthe plants with which the Egyptian jugglers stupefy the snakes they play\r\nwith.\"\r\n\r\n[190] _Ceylon_, i., 147.\r\n\r\n[191] \"On the Habits of the Viper in Silesia:\" _Zoologist_, p. 829.\r\n\r\n[192] _Trav. to the Sources of the Nile, passim._\r\n\r\n[193] _Travels in the Levant, passim._\r\n\r\n[194] _Discov. in Africa_, ii., p. 292.\r\n\r\n[195] _Lucan's Pharsalia._\r\n\r\n[196] _Ind.

I do not know\r\nthat I could say with the poet,--\r\n\r\n      \"A thing of beauty is a joy _for ever_;\"\r\n\r\nbut certainly it is a joy as long as it endures; and the naturalist\r\nfinds an endless recurrence of things of beauty. Birds, insects, shells,\r\nzoophytes, flowers, sea-weeds, are all redundant of beauty; and all the\r\nclasses of natural objects, though not in an equal degree, nor\r\nmanifestly in every individual object, yet possess it as a prominent\r\nelement. Indeed, from the profusion with which loveliness is sown\r\nbroadcast over the works of God, I have often thought, though it is not\r\ndirectly revealed, that a sense of the beautiful and a complacency in\r\nit, altogether independent of fitness for certain ends, or the uses\r\nwhich may be subserved, is an attribute of the Holy One Himself, and\r\nthat our perception of it is the reflection of His--a part of that image\r\nof God in which man was created, and which sin has not wholly\r\nobliterated. I know that God may have clothed His works with beauty for\r\nother admiring eyes than man's; and that it is probable that the holy\r\nangels may be far more conversant with creation than we are with all our\r\nresearches,--that the ten thousand times ten thousand flowers which are\r\n\"born to blush unseen\" by _man_, may be seen and admired by \"ten\r\nthousand times ten thousand\" angels,[203] and thus the tribute of praise\r\nfor their perfection may be ever ascending before Him whose hands made\r\nthem for His glory. We may allow this; and yet with reverence presume\r\nthat His own pure eyes look upon the lilies' array with a delight in\r\ntheir mere loveliness, infinitely greater than that which men, or even\r\nangels, take in it, seeing it is written,--\"for thy pleasure they are,\r\nand were created.\"\r\n\r\nI remember being struck, and somewhat awed, too, with a thought of this\r\nkind, once, when, pushing my way through a very dense and tangled\r\nthicket in a lone and lofty mountain region of Jamaica, sufficiently\r\nremote from the dwellings of man to render it probable that no civilized\r\nhuman foot had penetrated thither before. I suddenly came upon a most\r\nmagnificent terrestrial orchid in full blossom. It was _Phajus\r\nTankervilliæ_,--a noble plant, which from the midst of broad leaves\r\ngrowing out of a mass of green bulbs, had thrown up its stout\r\nblossom-stems to the height of a yard or more, crowned with the\r\npyramidal spike of lily-like flowers, whose expanding petals of pure\r\nwhite on one side and golden brown on the other, and trumpet-lip of\r\ngorgeous purple seemed, to my ravished gaze, the very perfection of\r\nbeauty. For ages, I thought, that beauteous flower had been growing in\r\nthat wild and unvisited spot, every season \"filling the air around with\r\nbeauty,\" and had in all probability never met a single human gaze\r\nbefore. Had, then, all that divinely-formed loveliness been mere waste\r\nfor those generations? I asked myself; and I immediately replied, No:\r\nthe eye of God himself hath rested on it with satisfaction, and the Lord\r\nhath taken pleasure in this work of His hands.\r\n\r\nI shall not make this chapter an essay on the sublime and beautiful, nor\r\nseek to analyse the sense of beauty. It is enough that it is an appetite\r\nof our being, and that most abundantly in nature, on every side, there\r\nis the material of its gratification. So abundantly, indeed, that it\r\nwere easy to expand the few pages which I propose to devote to the\r\nsubject into a volume, or a dozen volumes, and yet leave untouched vast\r\ntreasures of the beautiful in natural history. I must content myself and\r\nmy readers with the selection of a few of the more prominent objects in\r\nwhich this sense is gratified, and with a discrimination of two or three\r\ndistinct phases or conditions of existence which contribute, each in its\r\nmeasure, to give delight to the eyes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANTELOPES.]\r\n\r\nAmong Quadrupeds, there is perhaps less of beauty, strictly considered,\r\nthan in most other classes of animals. Elegance of form, however, which\r\nis one phase of it, is seen in the lithe and active squirrel, the pretty\r\npetaurist, and many other of the smaller beasties, and is found in\r\nperfection in the deer and antelopes. Who that has seen a pet fawn\r\ncoming to be caressed by a fair girl, but must have had his sense of the\r\nbeautiful gratified? Mark the freedom and grace of every motion! See\r\nhow it stretches out its pretty meek face and taper neck towards the\r\nhand; its extreme timidity causing its whole body and every limb to\r\nstart on the slightest stir from the beholders, while on the least\r\napproach it bounds away in the exuberant playfulness of its little\r\nheart, then stops, and turns, and gazes, and stretches out its neck\r\nagain! See when it trots or walks, how high it lifts its little slender\r\nfeet, bending its agile limbs as if motion itself were a pleasure! See,\r\nas it stands, with one fore-foot bent up, the hoof nearly touching the\r\nbelly; the long graceful ears moving this way and that, now thrown\r\nforwards, now backwards, now erected, to catch the slightest\r\nsound,--what a picture of fairy grace it is! There is beauty, too, in\r\nthe soft, full liquid eye of these animals,--the \"bright, black eye\" of\r\nthe \"dear gazelle,\" which in the East is the very ideal of female\r\nloveliness. Its melting gaze seems full of tenderness, so that we cannot\r\nlook without loving it.\r\n\r\nNor is beauty of colour wholly wanting. How rich is the tawny fur of the\r\ntiger, dashed with its black streaks! And the brighter yellow of the\r\nleopard and the jaguar, studded all over with rosettes of black spots!\r\nWe forget the ferocity of the savage in its beautifully-painted coat.\r\nThe zebra, too,--with the fine contrast of those bands of richest sable\r\non the cream-coloured ground, now bold and broad, as on the rounded\r\nbody, now running in fine parallel but irregularly-waved lines, as on\r\nthe face,--is a beautiful quadruped; and a herd of them galloping\r\nwantonly over a South African plain, must be a sight worth seeing\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to Birds, however, beauty is not the exception, but the\r\nrule. The form of a bird is almost always graceful; the rounded\r\nswellings and undulations of outline, and the smoothness of the plumage\r\ngive pleasure to the eye, even when there is no attractiveness of hue.\r\nOne has almost a difficulty in naming an inelegant bird. But when, as in\r\na thousand instances, brilliancy of colouring is combined with elegance\r\nof shape and smoothness of plumage, we must be charmed. Is not our own\r\nlittle goldfinch, is not the pert chaffinch that comes up to our very\r\nfeet for a grain or a crumb, a pretty object? But the tropical\r\nbirds,--we must look at them if we wish to know what nature can do in\r\nthe way of adornment. We should go to the flats on the embouchure of the\r\nAmazon, and see the rosy spoonbills, in their delicate carnation dress,\r\nset off by the lustrous crimson of their shoulders and breast-tufts,\r\nfeeding by hundreds on the green mud, or watch the gorgeous ibises, all\r\nclad in glowing scarlet with black-tipped wings, when, in serried ranks,\r\na mile in length, like the vermillion cloud of morning, they come to\r\ntheir breeding-place,--a truly magnificent sight.[204]\r\n\r\nThe first of the Parrot tribe that I ever had an opportunity of seeing\r\nin its native freedom was the beautiful Parrakeet of the Southern\r\nStates. Eighty or a hundred birds in one compact flock passed me flying\r\nlow, and all nearly on the same plane; and, as they swept by, screaming\r\nas they went, I fancied that they looked like an immense shawl of green\r\nsatin, on which an irregular pattern was worked in scarlet and gold and\r\nazure. The sun's rays were brilliantly reflected from the gorgeous\r\nsurface, which rapidly sped past like a splendid vision.\r\n\r\nThe Cock of the Rock is a fine South American bird of the richest orange\r\ncolour, crowned with a double crest of feathers edged with purple. Mr\r\nWallace describes his search for it on the Rio Negro, and his admiration\r\nof its beauty. Some time he sought in vain, for it is a rare bird, till\r\nthe old Indian who was his guide suddenly caught him by the arm, and,\r\npointing to a dense thicket, whispered in a low tone, \"Gallo!\" Peering\r\nthrough the foliage, the naturalist caught a glimpse of the magnificent\r\nbird, sitting amidst the gloom, and shining out like a mass of brilliant\r\nflame. As it is easily alarmed and very wary, it required some following\r\nand perseverance before he shot it. One of his Indians descended into\r\nthe deep rocky glen into which it fell, and brought it to him. \"I was\r\nlost,\" he says, \"in admiration of the dazzling beauty of its soft downy\r\nfeathers; not a spot of blood was visible, not a feather was ruffled,\r\nand the soft, warm, flexible body set off the fresh swelling plumage in\r\na manner which no stuffed specimen can approach.\"[205]\r\n\r\nThere is something exquisitely pleasing to the eye in the delicate\r\npainting of the soft plumage in most of the Goatsuckers and their\r\nallies. Entirely destitute of brilliant hues as they are, the\r\ncombinations of warm browns, and cool greys, interchanged with black and\r\nwhite, and the manner in which these are softened, and blended, and\r\nminutely pencilled, produce an effect that is peculiarly charming.\r\n\r\nIn the Trogons of the tropical regions we see elegance of form combined\r\nwith the most gorgeous colouring. Green and gold, crimson, scarlet,\r\norange, and black, are the hues of these birds, which hide themselves in\r\nthe deep dark recesses of the Amazonian and Indian forests. That species\r\ncalled the Resplendent is the noblest of the race, whose magnificence\r\nwas so well appreciated by the ancient Mexican emperors, that none but\r\nmembers of the royal family were permitted to adorn themselves with its\r\nflowing plumes. The whole upper parts of this bird, its fine coronal\r\ncrest of erectile plumes, its shoulder-hackles, or long lance-shaped\r\nfeathers, that droop over the sides, and the elongated tail-coverts\r\nwhich hang down beyond the tail to a length of three feet or more,\r\ncurving elegantly under the bird, as it sits on a branch, are of the\r\nrichest golden green, shining with a satiny radiance. The under parts\r\nare of a splendid scarlet, and the tail feathers are white, with broad\r\nblack bars.\r\n\r\nMore enchanting than mere colour, however rich and glowing this may be,\r\nis the fine metallic reflection which we see on the plumage of many\r\ntropical birds. The Rifle-bird of Australia might be seen sitting on a\r\ntree, and be passed by with contempt as a mere crow, while the eye was\r\nattracted to a more gaily-hued parrot by its side. But viewed close at\r\nhand, in the full blaze of the sun, the darker-plumaged bird is seen to\r\nexceed the other by far, in gorgeous glory, and to be not unworthy of\r\nthe specific title of _Paradiseus_, by which it is known to naturalists.\r\nThe body generally is of a deep velvet black, but it reflects a purple\r\nflush on the upper parts, and the feathers of the under parts are edged\r\nwith olive-green. The crown of the head, and the whole throat, are\r\nclothed with scale-like feathers of the brightest emerald-green, which\r\nblaze with a gemmeous lustre in certain lights, and make the most vivid\r\ncontrast with the velvet of the body. The tail displays its two middle\r\nfeathers of the same lustrous green, while the bordering ones are deep\r\nblack.\r\n\r\nThe vast and little-known island of Papua contains some specimens of the\r\nfeathered race of surpassing glory. The _Epimachi_, or Plume-birds, take\r\na prominent place in this category. They are remarkable for the erectile\r\nscale-like feathers of the sides and shoulders, which form large\r\nfan-shaped tufts, standing out from the body in a very striking manner.\r\nSpeaking of the superb Epimachus, Sonnerat, its describer, thus\r\nwrites:--\"As if to add to the singularity of this bird, nature has\r\nplaced above and below its wings feathers of an extraordinary form, and\r\nsuch as one does not see in other birds; she seems, moreover, to have\r\npleased herself in painting this being, already so singular, with her\r\nmost brilliant colours. The head, the neck, and the belly are glittering\r\ngreen; the feathers which cover these parts possess the lustre and\r\nsoftness of velvet to the eye and touch; the back is changeable violet;\r\nthe wings are of the same colour, and appear, according to the lights in\r\nwhich they are held, blue, violet, or deep black; always, however,\r\nimitating velvet. The tail is composed of twelve feathers, the two\r\nmiddle feathers are the longest, and the lateral feathers gradually\r\ndiminish; it is violet, or changeable blue above, and black beneath. The\r\nfeathers which compose it are as wide in proportion as they are long,\r\nand shine above and below with the brilliancy of polished metal.\r\n\r\n\"Above the wings the scapularies are very long and singularly formed;\r\ntheir points being very short on one side, and very long on the other.\r\nThese feathers are of the colour of polished steel, changing into blue,\r\nterminated by a large spot of brilliant green, and forming a species of\r\ntuft or appendage at the margin of the wings.\r\n\r\n\"Below the wings spring long curved feathers, directed upwards; these\r\nare black on the inside, and brilliant green on the outside. The bill\r\nand feet are black.\"[206]\r\n\r\nThe same author, in referring to the brilliant metallic hues of this and\r\nother birds, takes occasion to notice the iridescent effect which is\r\nproduced by the different angle at which light falls on the feathers.\r\nThe emerald-green, for instance, will often fling out rays of its two\r\nconstituent primary colours, at one time being blue-green, at another\r\ngold-green, while in certain lights all colour vanishes, and a\r\nvelvet-black is presented to the eye. The ruby feathers of several birds\r\nbecome orange under certain lights, and darken to a crimson-black at\r\nother times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOURNING THE DEAD CUCKOO.]\r\n\r\nThis change of hue is analogous to the well-known iridescent\r\nchangeableness of the nacre which lines various shells, and is owing to\r\nthe structure of its surface reflecting the light in different rays,\r\naccording to the angle at which it falls upon the feathers.\r\n\r\nAnother species, a native of the same teeming region, the Twelve-thread\r\nEpimachus, glows, with equal lustre, in the richest violet and emerald,\r\nbut somewhat diversely arranged. The long, elegant depending tail is\r\nhere reduced to ordinary dimensions, but, as if to compensate for this\r\ninferiority, the Twelve-thread is adorned with an expanding dress of the\r\npurest snowy white, composed of long silky plumes that spring from\r\nbehind and below the wings, so soft and so loosely webbed as to wave\r\ngracefully in the slightest breeze. From these tufts project long and\r\nvery slender shafts, unwebbed, and as fine as threads, curling\r\nelegantly, six on each side.\r\n\r\nThe little Sun-birds of India and Africa, and the still tinier\r\nHumming-birds of the New World are conspicuous for the metallic radiance\r\nof their plumage. Take for an example of the former the Fire-tailed\r\nSun-bird of Nepâl. The crown and forehead are brilliant steel-blue,\r\nwhile the neck, the back, and the rump are of the richest scarlet,\r\ndiversified by a broad patch of bright yellow across the middle of the\r\nback. The central feathers of the tail are lengthened, and are bright\r\nscarlet, while the lateral feathers are edged with the same rich hue on\r\nbrown. The breast is golden yellow or orange, flushed with crimson in\r\nthe centre, and the rest of the inferior parts are olive-green. Most of\r\nthose gorgeous colours have a silky or metallic lustre, and blaze out\r\nunder the tropical sunlight with amazing brightness.\r\n\r\nExquisite ornaments are these to an Indian garden, where they delight in\r\nthe flowering plants and shrubs. They creep to and fro about the stalks\r\nand twigs, clinging by their little purple feet, and rifling the tubular\r\ncorollas of the honeyed blossoms, whence doubtless they gather many\r\nminute insects, licked up with the nectar, by the aid of their curiously\r\npencilled tongue.\r\n\r\nFor that peculiar charm which resides in flashing light combined with\r\nthe most brilliant colours, the lustre of precious stones, there are no\r\nbirds, no creatures, that can compare with the Humming-birds. Confined\r\nexclusively to America,--whence we have already gathered between three\r\nand four hundred distinct species, and more are being continually\r\ndiscovered,--these lovely little winged gems were to the Mexican and\r\nPeruvian Indians the very quintessence of beauty. By these simple people\r\nthey were called by various names signifying \"the rays of the sun,\" \"the\r\ntresses of the day-star,\" and the like. Their glittering scale-like\r\nplumage was employed to make, at the cost of immense time, patience, and\r\nlabour, the radiant mantles in which the emperors and highest nobles\r\nappeared on state occasions, as well as to form by a sort of mosaic,\r\nthose embroidered pictures which so attracted the admiration of the\r\nSpanish conquerors. The Mexican priests adopted the tiny birds into\r\ntheir mythology: they taught that the souls of those warriors who died\r\nin defence of the gods, were conducted by Toyamiqui, the wife of the\r\ngod of war, straight to the mansion of the sun, and there transformed\r\ninto humming-birds.\r\n\r\nIn the gorgeous forest glooms of the mountainous parts of Jamaica, and\r\nespecially in the sunny glades which here and there break their\r\nuniformity, where the ever-verdant foliage rises upon all sides of the\r\nopen space like a wall, covered with the most elegant and fragrant\r\nflowers, I have been charmed by the familiar fearlessness and lustrous\r\nsplendour of these little creatures. Here sitting down on a prostrate\r\nlog in the shadow, I have watched them sipping all around, flitting to\r\nand fro, coming and going, every moment disappearing in the sombre\r\nshade, or suddenly flashing out, with a whirr like that of a\r\nspinning-wheel, into the bright sunshine. Bold and unsuspecting, they\r\nmight be seen exploring bush after bush, and coming, while I remained\r\nmotionless, even within arm's length of me, busily rifling all the\r\nblossoms in rapid succession, regularly quartering the surface of some\r\nfavourite shrub, so as to lose none, and of course, in their zeal,\r\nfrequently probing the same flower again and again. Sometimes it would\r\nbe the Mango, suspending himself on whirring pinions in front of the\r\nflowers, his broadly-expanded tail-feathers of the richest violet, his\r\nbody plumage all green and gold, and his cheeks and throat blazing, in\r\nthe changing light, with the radiance now of the ruby, now of the\r\namethyst, now of the sapphire, and now becoming for an instant the most\r\nintense black. But much more commonly on these occasions was I visited\r\nby the elegant Long-tail, whose slender form, black velvet crest,\r\nemerald bosom, and long tail-plumes, distinguish it as one of the\r\n_principes_ of this patrician race. This lovely little gem would be\r\nhovering about, half-a-dozen visible at the same moment, threading the\r\nprojecting branches, now probing here, now there, one moment above a\r\nflower and bending down to it, the next hanging below it, and thrusting\r\nup its crimson beak to kiss its nectar-tube from beneath, the cloudy\r\nwings on each side vibrating with a noise like that of a factory wheel,\r\nand its entire throat, breast and belly clothed in scaly plumage of the\r\nrichest green, contrasted finely with the velvety black of all beside.\r\nThis scaly plumage would flash brilliantly back the sun's light, like a\r\nnoble emerald in the crown of a king; then, by the slightest possible\r\nturn of the bird, it would become black, all the light being absorbed;\r\nthen, on another movement, it would seem a dark rich olive, and in an\r\ninstant flame forth again with emerald effulgence, over which olive and\r\nblack clouds were momentarily passing and repassing.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of this changing lustre is worthy of more careful\r\nattention than it has received. In such Humming-birds as I have\r\nexamined,--and possibly it may be a general rule,--the iridescence of\r\nthose portions of the plumage that are changeable is splendid in the\r\nratio of the acuteness of the angle formed by the incident ray and the\r\nreflected one. Thus the scaly plumage of the neck of the Mango appears\r\nto advantage in a room with a single window, only when the beholder\r\nstands with his back to the light, and has the bird before him and\r\nfacing him. Then the perpendicular band down the throat and breast,\r\nwhich seems composed of the richest black velvet, is bounded on each\r\nside by a broad band of glowing crimson, mingled with violet. It is not\r\nthe _entire_ plumage of even a Humming-bird that displays these\r\nrefulgent gleams: some of the brilliant hues are permanent, not\r\nchangeable colours; such as the golden greens which adorn the back and\r\nwing-coverts in so many species; in which the colour is subject to\r\nlittle change, and the only effect produced by the alteration of the\r\nangle of the light is the transforming the tips of the feathers into the\r\nappearance of burnished gold.\r\n\r\nWilson[207] has remarked that the plumage of the Indigo finch\r\n(_Fringilla cyanea_) in certain lights appears of a rich sky-blue and in\r\nothers of a vivid verdigris green, so that the same bird, in passing\r\nfrom one place to another before your eyes, seems to undergo a total\r\nchange of colour. When the rays of light so fall on the plumage that the\r\nangle of the incident and reflected ray is acute, the colour is green,\r\nwhen obtuse, blue. I have myself noticed exactly the same thing in the\r\nbrilliant changeable colour of insects,--as, for instance, the\r\n_Cicindelæ_ of America, and the Emerald Virgin Dragonfly (_Agrion\r\nVirginica_.)\r\n\r\nTo return, however, to our Humming-birds, of which my readers will like\r\nto have one or two more described,--_la crême de la crême_, the very\r\n_élite_ of this lovely little fairy population. If we were to cross the\r\nAtlantic to Brazil, track up the mighty Amazon some thirty days' sail,\r\nand a distance of a thousand miles, we should come to the mouth of the\r\nRio Negro, where a remarkable change in the appearance of the water\r\nindicates a totally different region. Instead of the muddy water of the\r\nAmazon, resembling pea-soup, that of the Negro is intensely dark, but\r\nclear and limpid, every ripple sparkling like crystal. The land becomes\r\nhigh, and the river, some four miles wide, passes between lofty cliffs,\r\ncrowned with the rich green walls of the primeval forest. The country is\r\nfar more attractive than that on the Amazon; instead of a dead level,\r\nswampy and intersected by sluggish _igaripés_, or shallow ponds,\r\noverhung by impenetrably tangled thickets, and full of venomous flies,\r\nhere are gentle hills, and tiny brooks of sparkling water, and a\r\ncomparatively open forest, with bright clear glades in which the\r\ntraveller may recline without persecution from the flies,--these pests\r\nbeing unknown on the \"black waters.\" The ground is covered by evergreens\r\nof different species and exquisite forms, and many kinds of elegant\r\nferns are growing in the valleys. There are few lianes or spinous briers\r\nstretching from tree to tree, obstructing free passage, but a thousand\r\nlesser vines drape the low tree tops with myriads of flowers, new and\r\nattractive to the visitor. Everywhere the forest is intersected by\r\npaths, some made by the inhabitants in their frequent rambles, others by\r\nwild animals that come to the water to drink; and along these the eager\r\nnaturalist can readily pass to the feeding trees of many beautiful and\r\npeculiar birds.\r\n\r\nHere are wont to haunt many varieties of the richly-hued trogons,\r\nunknown to the lower regions; and at any hour their plaintive note may\r\nbe heard at intervals, as they sit moodily, singly or in pairs, on the\r\nbranches, with the long tail outspread and drooping, watching for\r\npassing insects. Cuckoos of several kinds, their plumage glancing red in\r\nthe subdued light, flit noiselessly through the woods, searching for\r\ncaterpillars. Purple jays, in large flocks, alight on some berry-bearing\r\ntree, chattering and gesticulating, but shy and alert,--ready to start\r\nat the snapping of a twig. Motmots and chatterers in gayest\r\nhues,--scarlet, violet and blue,--are abundant. Goatsuckers, in\r\nexquisitely-blended and pencilled tones of colour, start from some shady\r\nglen where they are dozing away the day hours, and, flying a short\r\ndistance on soft winnowing pinions, rest again, and seem to fall asleep\r\nin an instant. Showy manikins and tanagers of the brightest tints are\r\nflaunting in every bush: pigeons and doves of soberer hues are cooing\r\ntheir gentle complainings in the taller trees; and guans and curassows\r\nare marching with stately pace in the paths, picking here and there some\r\ndelicate morsel; or running with loud harsh cry, with outstretched neck\r\nand rapid stride, as they detect approaching danger.[208]\r\n\r\nStill, conspicuous above all are the Humming-birds, which, revelling in\r\nthis region of the sun, are buzzing around the blossoming shrubs like\r\ninsects. And pre-eminent among these is the Fiery Topaz, a name that\r\nattempts to express what neither title, nor description, nor coloured\r\nfigure can adequately express,--its gemmeous magnificence and lustre.\r\nOne of the first ornithologists of the age, the Prince of Canino, has\r\nassigned to the species the honour of being \"_inter Trochilides\r\npulcherrimus_.\" Description, however, I must give, for want of anything\r\nbetter, since, even if I possessed a living specimen, I could not\r\nexhibit its living radiance to all my readers: therefore, pray pay\r\nattention to the details, and imagine. The general hue of this imperial\r\natom is a blazing scarlet, in fine contrast with which the head and\r\nlower part of the throat are deep velvet-black. The gorget of the throat\r\nis emerald green, with a cloud of delicate crimson in the centre. The\r\nlower part of the back, the rump and the upper tail-coverts are of that\r\nbeautiful bronzed green which changes to orange gold, so frequently seen\r\nin this tribe; while the wing-quills and tail are purplish black, except\r\nthe middle pair of feathers in the latter, which are very slender,\r\nproject to a great length, and cross each other; these are green with a\r\npurple gloss.\r\n\r\nAmong the hundreds of species of this very lovely tribe that swarm in\r\nthe intertropical regions of South America, I will select one more for\r\nits surpassing beauty. It is the Bar-tailed Comet. We must look for it\r\nin the temperate and equable valley of the Desaguedero, which leads out\r\nof Lake Titiçaça, the largest sheet of water on the South American\r\ncontinent, and famous in Peruvian tradition, as the scene where Mango\r\nCapac and Mama Ocollo surprised the barbarous aborigines by their first\r\nappearance. On one of the charming islets of this quiet lake, the two\r\naugust strangers were seen, clothed in garments; and, declaring that\r\nthey were the children of the sun long prophesied of, proceeded to teach\r\ntheir simple subjects the arts of civilisation, and to establish a\r\nregular government. We must search for our tiny Comet, too, in the\r\ncultivated plains that surround the Cerro of Potosi, that singular cone\r\nsixteen thousand feet in height, which is wholly composed of silver, and\r\nwhich is estimated to have yielded, during the three hundred years that\r\nhave elapsed since the Indian exposed the solid silver, when he\r\naccidentally tore up a shrub by the roots,--the sum of two hundred\r\nmillions of pounds sterling. The districts around, and specially the\r\nenvirons of the town of Chuquisaca, are adorned with a profusion of\r\ngardens and orchards, in which many European trees and flowers grow, as\r\nwell as those of the tropics, the climate possessing the charms of many\r\nregions. In the shrubberies of the city, and in the gardens of the\r\nIndian cottages, as well as the slopes of the surrounding mountains,\r\nwhere the native groves and forests grow undisturbed, the brilliant\r\nBar-tail may be seen during the summer months; but, as soon as the\r\nchilling winds of April tell of coming winter, the charming visitor\r\nbecomes scarce, and flitting northward finds in the forests of Lower\r\nPeru the mild and balmy air which he loves. When the trees are in\r\nblossom, and particularly the apple-trees, which have been introduced\r\nfrom Europe, and are largely cultivated in orchards, the males may be\r\nseen shooting in and out among the foliage, like glowing coals of fire,\r\nchasing each other with shrill chirpings, and with surprising\r\nperseverance and acrimony. The fields of maize, and pulse, and other\r\nleguminous plants which are cultivated in the plains, receive a fair\r\nshare of his attention; and the nopâleries, or cactus-gardens, where the\r\ncochineal insect is reared for those most valuable crimson and scarlet\r\ndyes, which far outshine the vaunted productions of ancient Tyre. The\r\nblossom of the nopâl is itself one of the most splendid of flowers. It\r\nbegins to open as the sun declines, and is in full expanse throughout\r\nthe night, shedding a delicious fragrance, and offering its brimming\r\ngoblet, filled with nectareous juice, to thousands of moths, and other\r\ncrepuscular and nocturnal insects. When the moon is at the full in those\r\ncloudless nights whose loveliness is known only in the tropics, the\r\nbroad blossom is seen as a circular disk nearly a foot in diameter, very\r\nfull of petals, of which the outer series are of a yellowish hue,\r\ngradually paling to the centre, where they shine in the purest white.\r\nThe numerous recurving stamens surround the style which rises in the\r\nmidst like a polished shaft, the whole glowing in its silvery beauty\r\nunder the moonbeams, from the dark and matted foliage, and diffusing its\r\ndelicious clove-like fragrance so profusely that the air is loaded with\r\nit for furlongs round.\r\n\r\nOther species of Cactus and Cereus, some with yellow, and some with\r\npink, and some with rich crimson blossoms,--the pride of our\r\nconservatories,--sprawl profusely in these gardens; and here the\r\nBar-tail flaunts all day long sipping the nectar, and picking up myriads\r\nof minute insects which the blossoms attract, and which lodge in the\r\nhoneyed recesses.\r\n\r\nBut it is time that the reader should know what sort of a bird this\r\nBar-tailed Comet is. Attend, then, while I describe his ball-dress, more\r\nlustrous than any fair lady ever wore at Almack's. The head, neck, upper\r\npart of the back, and a considerable portion of the under surface, are\r\nlight green, with reflections of burnished gold on the cheeks and\r\nforehead. The lower back is of a deep crimson. The throat flames like an\r\nemerald. The tail is the chief feature, the feathers being broad, and\r\ngreatly lengthened, in regular graduation from the central ones to the\r\noutmost pair, which are double the length of the entire bird besides.\r\nThe form of the tail is widely forked, its outline having a double\r\ncurve, somewhat lyre-shaped. The tail-coverts are ruddy brown; and the\r\nfeathers themselves are of the richest and most glowing fire-colour,\r\nincomparably lustrous; each feather being broadly tipped with velvety\r\nblack. The graduation of the feathers throws these terminal black tips\r\nto a considerable distance from each other, and their alternation with\r\nthe intermediate spaces of the fiery glow has an inconceivably charming\r\neffect, as the bird makes its rapid evolutions through the air, and\r\nwhisks about among the flowers, with a velocity which the eye of the\r\nbeholder can scarcely follow. It is very fond of certain long\r\ntrumpet-shaped pendent blossoms, into which it penetrates so far, that\r\nnothing of it can be seen except the tips of its radiant forked tail\r\nprojecting from the tube.\r\n\r\nAnother family of birds that is conspicuous for gorgeous beauty is that\r\nof the Pheasants. Our own familiar species, which is said to have been\r\nbrought long ages ago from the banks of the Phasis in Colchis, by Jason\r\nin the Argo,--\r\n\r\n      \"Argivâ primum sum transportata carinâ,\"[209]--\r\n\r\nis a very splendid bird, and is well painted in a few lines by\r\nPope;--who speaks of his\r\n\r\n                              \"Glossy varying dyes,\r\n      His purple crest and scarlet-circled eyes;\r\n      The vivid green his shining plumes unfold,\r\n      His painted wings, and breast that flames with gold.\"[210]\r\n\r\nBut besides this, there are Indian and Chinese species which excel it in\r\nglory. There are the richly-pencilled Gold and Silver Pheasants, and the\r\nnoble Reeves' and Amherst Pheasants, with their extraordinary\r\nlong-barred tail plumes. The last named is a bird of unusual\r\nmagnificence.\r\n\r\nThen there is the splendid Fire-back of Sumatra and Java, which is\r\nadorned with a crest of slender stalked feathers, each expanding into a\r\ndisk with spreading barbs. The head, neck, breast, and belly of this\r\nrare bird are of deep steel-blue, very lustrous, the lower part of the\r\nback fiery orange-red or flame-colour, varying in intensity according to\r\nthe incidence of the light, and passing like a zone of fire round the\r\nbody, though less brilliant on the abdomen; the rump and tail-coverts\r\nbroad and truncate, bluish-green, each feather tipped by a paler bar.\r\nThe tail is erect and arched, somewhat like that of the common cock,\r\nits middle feathers are pure white, and all the rest black, with green\r\nreflections. The legs and feet, which are scarlet, and the skin of the\r\nface, purple, complete the toilet of this magnificent oriental.\r\n\r\nWhat shall we say to the Argus Pheasant, the bird of Malacca with the\r\nmagnificent pinions? How fine a sight must it be to see this noble fowl\r\ndisplaying his coxcombery in the presence of his admiring hens,\r\nstrutting to and fro with his long tail feathers spread and erected, and\r\nhis broad wings expanded and scraping the ground far on each side! The\r\ncolours, it is true, are sober browns, varied with black and white; but\r\nhow exquisitely are these arranged! Perhaps no brilliancy of tint would\r\nmore charm the eye than the row of ocellated spots,--each a dark\r\ncircular disk surrounded by concentric circles,--that runs along the\r\ncentre of each of the enormously-developed secondary wing-quills.\r\n\r\nTo come back to colour and metallic refulgence. We must not overlook the\r\nMonâl, or Scaly Impeyan of the Himalaya chain. This fowl, which is\r\nlittle less than a turkey, looks as if clothed in scale armour of\r\niridescent metal, of which the specific hues can scarcely be indicated,\r\nso changeable are they; green, steel-blue, crimson, purple, and\r\ngolden-bronze,--all of the utmost intensity of colour, and of dazzling\r\nrefulgence, adorn this bird, set off by a broad square patch of pure\r\nwhite in the middle of the back, while the crown of the head carries a\r\ndrooping crest of naked-shafted, broad-tipped, green feathers. This\r\nsplendid fowl is as hardy as the turkey or pheasant, and will probably\r\nbefore long be domesticated in British preserves, to which it would be a\r\nnoble addition, being perhaps exceeded by nothing in nature for\r\nrefulgence.\r\n\r\nIn the same regions are found the Polyplectrons, or Pheasant Peacocks,\r\nbirds of the same family. Look at one of these in detail, the Crested\r\nPolyplectron of the Sunda Isles. It much resembles a peacock in contour,\r\nthe head and neck black, with steely reflections, relieved by a long\r\nstripe of white arching over each eye, and a broad patch of the same on\r\nthe ears. The forehead and crown carry a crest of tall feathers capable\r\nof erection, and making a fine ornament. The whole under parts are\r\nvelvet black; the back and rump warm brown, with paler wavy bands and\r\nlines. The coverts and secondary feathers of the wings are of the\r\nrichest blue, each feather tipped with velvety black. But the tail is\r\nthe grand display. It is a true tail, not a train of superincumbent\r\nfeathers as in the peacock, the quill-feathers being of great length and\r\nbreadth, and the whole capable of being widely expanded into an enormous\r\nrounded fan. The individual feathers are brown, pencilled and sprinkled\r\nwith pale buff,--a pretty ground, on each of which is painted two large\r\noval eye-spots of the most brilliant metallic blue or green, according\r\nto the light, contained within encircling double rings of black and\r\nwhite. These refulgent eyes are so set that they constitute two curved\r\nbands placed at some distance apart, running across the tail, and when\r\nthis organ is expanded they impart to it a most regal appearance.\r\n\r\nLast, but not least, in this distinguished tribe, there is the familiar\r\nPeacock, a proverb of splendour in raiment from the remote antiquity of\r\nAristophanes and Aristotle to Mr Hollingshead, who lashes the sumptuary\r\ntendencies of our modern ladies under the title of \"Peacockism.\"[211]\r\nThe true Peacock, however, the genuine bird, may at least plead that no\r\nmilliners' bills of £3000 are ever proved against him in Bankruptcy\r\nCourts.\r\n\r\nI am not going to be so impertinent as to describe in detail the plumage\r\nof a bird so well known as the Peacock. Who does not know his empurpled\r\nneck so elegantly bridled, his aigrette of four-and-twenty\r\nbattledore-feathers, his pencilled body-clothing, and, above all, his\r\ngrand erectile train with its rows of eyelets? Who has not admired the\r\nlustre and beauty of those eyelets,--the kidney-like nucleus of deepest\r\npurple, the surrounding band of green, widening in front and filling the\r\nnotch of the pupil, the broad circle of brown, and the narrow black ring\r\nedged with chestnut, and then the decomposed barbs of the feather,\r\ngilded green, all presenting the effulgence of burnished metal, or\r\nrather the glitter and glow of precious gems, flashing in the varying\r\nlight? One can hardly imagine the splendour of the scene described by\r\nColonel Williamson, as seen by him in the Jungleterry District in India,\r\nwhen, being engaged shooting these beautiful fowl, he estimates that not\r\nfewer than twelve or fifteen hundred Peafowl of various sizes were\r\nwithin sight of him for nearly an hour. \"Whole woods were covered with\r\ntheir beautiful plumage, to which the rising sun imparted additional\r\nbrilliancy. Small patches of plain among the long grass, most of them\r\ncultivated, and with mustard then in bloom, which induced the birds to\r\nfeed, increased the beauty of the scene.\"\r\n\r\nIn the preceding volume I have spoken of the gorgeous beauty of the\r\nBirds of Paradise, and have quoted the description given by Lesson of\r\nhis rapt feelings when, on first seeing a specimen in the forests of\r\nPapua, he could not shoot from emotion. A chapter on animal beauty\r\ncannot pass over this magnificent family, though to my own taste there\r\nis something in the refulgent radiance of the Humming-birds and\r\nPheasants which is superior to anything seen in the Paradise-birds. The\r\nlatter, or some of them at least, give me the idea of being\r\nover-dressed, particularly that one called the Superb, whose singular\r\nforked gorget and shoulder-cape, gorgeous as these adornments are, with\r\ntheir lustrous violet and green flushes, are somewhat inelegant in form.\r\nYet some of them are softly beautiful;--\r\n\r\n      \"So richly deck'd in variegated down,\r\n      Green, sable, shining yellow, shading brown,\r\n      Tints softly with each other blended,\r\n      Hues doubtfully begun and ended;\r\n      Or intershooting, and to sight\r\n      Lost and recover'd, as the rays of light\r\n      Glance in the conscious plumes touch'd here and there.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      \"This the Sun's Bird, whom Glendoveers might own,\r\n      As no unworthy partner in their flight\r\n      Through seas of ether, where the ruffling sway\r\n      Of nether air's rude billows is unknown:\r\n      Whom sylphs, if e'er for casual pastime they\r\n      Through India's spicy regions wing their way,\r\n      Might bow to as their lord.\"[212]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PEACOCK-SHOOTING.]\r\n\r\nThe Emerald Paradise, the best known of the family, seems to have been\r\nin the poet's eye; and certainly the combination of form and colour in\r\nthis species is very charming. The rich chocolate of the upper parts,\r\nand the delicate lemon-yellow of the neck, contrast well with the\r\ngemmeous green lustre of the front, when the velvety plumage flashes and\r\ngleams in the sunlight. And the numerous soft floating plumes that arch\r\nout from the flanks to a great distance on all sides are exquisite in\r\nloveliness. \"Even in the absolute quiet of a stuffed skin under a glass\r\ncase,\" as Mr Wood remarks, \"these plumes are full of astonishing beauty,\r\ntheir translucent golden-white vanelets producing a most superb effect\r\nas they cross and recross each other, forming every imaginable shade of\r\nwhite, gold and orange, and then deepening towards their extremities\r\ninto a soft purplish red.\"\r\n\r\nMr G. Bennett, who saw a living specimen in an aviary at Macao,\r\ndescribes these long, elegant, loose-barbed plumes as occupying a good\r\ndeal of the bird's own attention and care. \"One of the best\r\nopportunities of seeing this splendid bird in all its beauty of action\r\nas well as display of plumage, is early in the morning, when he makes\r\nhis toilet: the beautiful sub-alar plumage is then thrown out and\r\ncleaned from any spot that may sully its purity, by being passed gently\r\nthrough the bill; the short chocolate wings are extended to the utmost,\r\nand he keeps them in a steady flapping motion as if in imitation of\r\ntheir use in flight, at the same time raising up the delicate long\r\nfeathers over the back, which are spread in a chaste and elegant manner,\r\nfloating like films in the ambient air. In this position the bird would\r\nremain for a short time, seemingly proud of its heavenly beauty, and in\r\nraptures of delight with its most enchanting self; it would then assume\r\nvarious attitudes, so as to regard its plumage in every direction.\"[213]\r\n\r\nPassing over all other classes of animate existence, I shall say a few\r\nwords on the surpassing loveliness which is displayed by many of the\r\nInsect tribes. The nursery prejudice, that these creatures are worthy\r\nonly to be trodden under foot, as things repulsive and disgusting, is\r\ncertainly decaying, though it retains its hold still in some minds. A\r\nglance through an entomological cabinet would prove how unjust are such\r\nnotions. If brilliant hues, polished surface, sculptured chasings,\r\ngraceful forms, and lively motions can command admiration, these are\r\ndisplayed by Insects to a degree which we should in vain look for in any\r\nother class of creatures. We need not speak of simple colours; these\r\noccur in profusion, of all hues, of all shades of intensity, and of the\r\nvery highest degrees of brightness; combined too, in the most elegant\r\nmanner, and very frequently, particularly in the _Lepidoptera_,\r\npresenting that peculiar charm which results from the association of\r\ntints that are complemental to each other.\r\n\r\nWords are always felt to be too poor to describe the refulgence of the\r\nhues of many of the feathered tribes;--the metallic gloss of the Trogons\r\nand the oriental _Gallinaceæ_, the gem-like flashings of the\r\nHumming-birds and the Birds of Paradise. Perhaps it would be deemed\r\nextravagant to assert, that these glories can be _excelled_ by the tiny\r\nraces I am now discussing; but equalled, _most fully equalled_, they\r\nassuredly are. To possess the glow of burnished metal upon the most\r\nvaried hues, is, in the order _Coleoptera_, a common thing. Most of the\r\n_Eumolpidæ_ are remarkable for this; of which I may instance _Chrysochus\r\nfulgidus_, a beetle from Bombay. The _Buprestidæ_ have long been\r\ncelebrated, for the same reason; and portions of their bodies have been\r\nused in the toilet of ladies, in association with diamonds and rubies.\r\n\r\nMany of the _Chlamydæ_ blaze with golden-crimson, purple, and the most\r\nfiery orange. The species of the small genus _Eurhinus_ seem to send\r\nforth the coloured flames of the pyrotechnic art. The _Longicornes_\r\ndisplay the same beauties, associated with gigantic size. _Cheloderus\r\nChildreni_, for example, a large beetle from Columbia, is equal to any\r\n_Buprestis_ for the radiance of the green, crimson, purple, blue,\r\nscarlet, and gold, that are all at the same time flaming from its\r\nsingularly-sculptured surface.\r\n\r\nBut there are impressions conveyed by the reflection of light from the\r\nbodies of many beetles, which far exceed the metallic fulgor of which I\r\nhave been speaking, beautiful as it is. I cannot hope to describe them\r\nintelligibly; I know of no combination of words which will give an idea\r\nof them. I mean the soft, almost velvety radiance of some of the\r\n_Goliathi_; of many of the _Cetoniæ_, as the genus _Eudicella_, for\r\ninstance; and of not a few of the _Phanæi_, in the former two, the hue\r\nis generally green; in the latter, this colour is associated with other\r\nhues, most glowing, yet of an indescribable softness. I cannot imagine\r\nanything of this sort more charming than the soft golden and orange hue\r\nupon the green of the magnificent _Phanæus imperialis_.\r\n\r\nOthers again, as _Hoplia farinosa_, a little chafer from Southern\r\nEurope, and many of the weevil tribe (_Curculionidæ_), are covered with\r\nscales of vivid splendour, but so minute, and so closely set, that the\r\nwhole surface reflects one soft but rich lustre of tints, differing\r\naccording to the species. We would instance, of these, the noble species\r\nof the genus _Cyphus_. Others of the same great family, on a dark but\r\nstill richly-coloured ground, have the minute scales clustered in spots\r\nor bands, forming regular patterns in much variety; and in these they\r\nreflect rainbow hues, as if a sunbeam decomposed through a prism had\r\nbeen solidified and pulverised; or if viewed through a lens, looking\r\nlike powdered gems, each individual scale changing its hues with the\r\nslightest motion of the eye. Among these we may mention _Hypsonotus\r\nelegans_, _Cyphus spectabilis_, _Entimus splendidus_, and _E.\r\nimperialis_, commonly known as diamond beetles; and the elegantly-shaped\r\ngenus _Pachyrhynchus_, of which the _P._ _gemmatus_, from the\r\nPhilippine Islands, is, perhaps, the most lovely of all earthly\r\ncreatures.\r\n\r\nAnd if we look at the _Lepidoptera_, the order more especially under\r\nreview, we feel that beauty belongs to them rather as an essence than as\r\nan accident. Their broad fan-like wings have an airy lightness and grace\r\nto which the painter and the poet pay homage, when they endow the sylphs\r\nand loves of their fancy with butterfly pinions.\r\n\r\nThey are clothed with minute scales, which are the vehicle of their\r\ncolours, somewhat resembling in this respect the beetles last spoken of;\r\nbut they have beauties peculiar to themselves. Fine combinations and\r\ncontrasts of colours are too much the rule in this order to need\r\nspecification; and these are often shaded and blended with a downy\r\nsoftness, as in the Sphinges and Moths. As illustrious examples, I will\r\nmention the _Gynautocera_, a group of Oriental Moths approaching in some\r\npoints the Butterflies, as exhibiting the most brilliant hues in bands\r\nand clouds, but softly blended and mingled, with exceeding chasteness\r\nand beauty.\r\n\r\nMany species of the genus _Catagramma_, a group of Butterflies marked on\r\nthe inferior surface of the fore-wings with scarlet and black, and on\r\nthat of the hind with singular concentric circles of black on a white\r\nground, have on the superior surface the metallic lustre common in the\r\nbeetles, the wings being of golden green or blue. The genus _Urania_ has\r\nthis radiance still more conspicuous; while the inferior surface of some\r\nof the _Theclæ_, as _T. imperialis_, _T. Actæon_, _T. Endymion_, &c., is\r\ncovered with the most rich and varied metallic hues, as if powdered\r\nwith gold, copper, and silver filings. Some Butterflies, as several of\r\nour native _Fritillaries_, and more vividly an American species,\r\n(_Argynnis passifloræ_,) one from New Zealand, (_Argyrophenga\r\nantipodum_,) and the beautiful _Paphia Clytemnestra_, have spots of\r\nburnished silver on their inferior surface; and several of our own\r\nmoths, as the genus _Plusia_, are so spotted on the upper surface.\r\nOthers display a lustre between that of silver and that of pearl, as\r\nseveral species of _Charaxes_ on one, and the magnificent _Morpho\r\nLaertes_ on both surfaces. But of this sort of beauty, perhaps nothing\r\ncan excel the gemmeous green, changing to azure, of _Papilio Ulysses_,\r\nor that of _Apatura (?) laurentia_; or, above all, of some of the great\r\nBrazilian _Morphos_. The blaze of silvery azure that flashes from _M.\r\nAdonis_, _M. Cytheris_, and _M. Menelaus_, is indescribable; the eyes\r\nare pained as they gaze upon it; yet there is said to be an unnamed\r\nspecies from the emerald mountains of Bogota, of which a single specimen\r\nis in a private cabinet in London, which is far more lustrous than\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nThe change from one hue to another produced by the play of light in\r\naltering the angle of its reflection, has always been much admired; and\r\nthis occurs in great perfection, and with much diversity, in the lovely\r\ninsects of the _Lepidopterous_ order.\r\n\r\nSome of the genus _Hætera_, (as _H. piera_, and _H. esmeralda_,) and\r\nmany of the _Heliconiadæ_, as _Hymenitis diaphana_, &c., have the wings\r\nnearly or quite destitute of the ordinary scaly clothing, presenting\r\nonly a transparent membrane of great delicacy; over which the light\r\nplays with a beautiful iridescence. _Papilio Arcturus_ and some allied\r\nspecies, are of a golden-green, changing to blue, or to glowing purple.\r\nVery many of the _Nymphalidæ_ are distinguished for a flush of\r\nsurpassing richness, that in one particular light gleams over the\r\nsurface. Our own _Apatura Iris_, commonly known as the purple emperor,\r\nis a native example of this beauty, and still more _A. namoura_; but\r\nespecially the species of the genus _Thaumantis_, as well as _Morpho\r\nMartia_, and _M. Automedon_. _Diadema bolina_ also displays a purple\r\nflush over and around the white spots, which is exquisitely beautiful.\r\nIn general this glow is found only in the male, but in the lovely\r\n_Epiphile chrysitis_ it is common to the female.\r\n\r\nIn _Colias Electra_ a warm purple glow plays over the surface in a\r\nstrong light, which is the more singularly beautiful, because the\r\npermanent colour which is thus suffused is a rich golden orange. There\r\nis, however, a species (_C. Lesbia_) of which only a single specimen is\r\nknown, and that is in fragments, in the Banksian Collection, which is in\r\nthis respect vastly superior to the former. In all these cases, the\r\nplaying gleam is more or less empurpled; in _Paphia Portia_, however, it\r\nmay be called crimson.\r\n\r\nBut still more exquisitely beautiful than any of these is the fine\r\nopalescence that irradiates some butterflies in the changing beam. There\r\nis a white butterfly from Senegal (_Anthocharis Ione_) allied to our\r\ncommon garden whites, marked at the tips of the wings with a spot of\r\nviolet, surrounded by black. In a certain aspect, there plays over this\r\nspot a violet opalescence of exceeding richness. And to mention no more,\r\n(for, indeed, we know not that we could mention anything to surpass\r\nthis,) the carnation spots on the black wings of _Papilio Anchises_, _P.\r\nÆneas_, _P. Tullus_, &c., are at intervals flushed with a violet\r\nopalescence, so brilliant, that we know no other object to compare with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn contemplating such objects, we cannot help concurring in the\r\nsentiments expressed by the pious Ray:--\"Quæri fortasse à nonnullis\r\npotest, quis Papilionum usus sit? Respondeo, Ad ornatum universi, et ut\r\nhominibus spectaculo sint: ad rura illustranda velut tot bracteæ\r\ninservientes. Quis enim eximiam earum pulchritudinem et varietatem\r\ncontemplans mira voluptate non afficiatur? Quis tot colorum et schematum\r\nelegantias naturæ ipsius ingenio excogitatas et artifici penicillo\r\ndepictas curiosis oculis intuens, divinæ artis vestigia eis impressa non\r\nagnoscat et miretur?\" And I may add, since such exquisite traces of\r\nloveliness remain in a world which Satan has spoiled and sin defiled,\r\nwhat must have been its glory when He who made it could take complacency\r\nin beholding it, and in the minutest details could pronounce it \"very\r\ngood!\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. James Smith of Monquhitter thus alludes to the exquisite beauty\r\nof some South American butterflies. One or two of the species I have\r\nalready alluded to, but even these can yield additional themes of\r\nadmiration. \"I hold,\" he says, \"that there are hues and shades of\r\ncolour which are positively beautiful in themselves, and independently\r\nof all associations whatever; and to look upon which merely as patches\r\nof colour, affords a gratification of no mean description. And for the\r\ntruth of such an opinion, I know not where I should obtain a stronger\r\nand a more pleasing proof, than from the _Lepidoptera_ to which I have\r\nalluded. The patch, for instance, which is on the posterior wings of the\r\n_Hætera Esmeralda_, and which may be characterised as a compound of\r\ncarmine and of the deepest blue dotted with two spots of vermilion, will\r\nin itself, and irrespectively of association, communicate a pleasure to\r\nevery eye which looks upon it. The band of silver blue on the wing of a\r\nlarge _Morpho_; the deep tone, to speak in pictorial phrase, of the\r\nblack in the _Papilio Sesostris_, finer even than the finest velvet of\r\nGenoa; the rich dark orange on _Epicilia Ancæa_; the blue, shining in\r\none unnamed species like polished steel, in another (_Thecla_) with a\r\nradiant clearness, which ultramarine itself could not surpass; the\r\nsatin-like golden green, the pearly lustrous white, and the deep shining\r\nemerald ribbons in _Urania Boisduvalii_; the crimson lines and spots\r\ndeeper and clearer than blood, in a species to which no name is\r\nattached, of _Papilio_; the small spangles of silver with which the\r\nunder surface of one of the least among them (_Cupido_) is, as it were,\r\nincrusted; the iridescent and delicate violet with which, on the same\r\nsurface, a particular species of _Hætera_ is, so to speak, washed over,\r\nin a way which calls to our remembrance the 'scumbling' given by\r\nRembrandt as the finishing touch to his finest productions; all these,\r\nand many more, possess a beauty which I contend, in opposition to the\r\ndoctrine of Alison and Jeffrey, is absolute in itself; which is\r\naltogether irrespective of association; and which the most skilful of\r\nhuman pencils would find it impossible completely and properly to\r\ncopy.\"[214]\r\n\r\nI must apologise to fair readers for alluding to Spiders--\"nasty\r\nspiders!\"--in a chapter on beauty; but prejudice must not make us shut\r\nour eyes to glories even among these. In the tropical species there is\r\noften metallic splendour and brilliance of colour. In my \"Naturalist's\r\nSojourn in Jamaica,\" my friend Mr Hill has written some very interesting\r\nobservations on the web of a certain Spider, and on the relations of its\r\nstructure with that of the Spider itself; but I allude to it now because\r\nof the elegance of the creature, the _Epeira argentata_ of Fabricius.\r\nThe upper surface of the body is of a glistening satiny or silvery\r\nwhiteness, the belly yellow, spotted with black, and the legs marked\r\nwith alternate rings of the same contrasted hues.\r\n\r\nIn the same island I was familiar with another species, (_Nephila\r\nclavipes_,) remarkable for the length and strength of its silken cords.\r\nThe body, which is lengthened, is studded with round white spots, each\r\nencircled with a black border, on a rich greenish brown ground,\r\nreminding one of the characteristic markings of the Tragopans among\r\nbirds. The cephalothorax is shining black, its lustre half concealed by\r\na clothing of short silvery down: the legs are very long, and have a\r\nremarkably elegant appearance from having a bunch of black hair set\r\naround the extremity of the first and second joints, like the bristles\r\nof a bottle-brush.\r\n\r\nI fortify my own verdict with the observations of a brother naturalist\r\non the Spiders of Borneo, presuming that those which he alludes to\r\nappear to belong to the genus _Gastracantha_, of which I have seen\r\nspecies in Jamaica.\r\n\r\n\"The spiders, so disgusting in appearance in many other countries, are\r\nhere of quite a different nature, and are the most beautiful of the\r\ninsect tribe; they have a skin of a shell-like texture, furnished with\r\ncurious processes, in some long, in others short, in some few, in others\r\nnumerous; but are found, of this description, only in thick woods and\r\nshaded places: their colours are of every hue, brilliant and metallic as\r\nthe feathers of the humming-bird, but are, unlike the bright colours of\r\nthe beetle, totally dependent on the life of the insect which they\r\nbeautify, so that it is impossible to preserve them.\"[215]\r\n\r\nIt is possible that this beauty might be less evanescent if the animals\r\nwere preserved in spirit or other antiseptic fluid. A writer in the\r\n_Zoologist_ (p. 5929) mentions the fact that the iridescence of certain\r\nbeetles (_Cassida_) which is peculiarly splendid and metallic, and which\r\ndisappears immediately on the insects' becoming dry, is perpetuated in\r\nits original loveliness when the specimens are preserved in spirit, even\r\nafter the lapse of several years.\r\n\r\nThe tropical species of this genus are far finer and richer than our\r\nlittle English kinds, though these are pretty. I was much delighted by\r\nthe brilliance of some of the Jamaican species, and Sir Emerson Tennent\r\nthus speaks of them in Ceylon:--\r\n\r\n\"There is one family of insects, the members of which cannot fail to\r\nstrike the traveller by their singular beauty, the _Cassidadæ_, or\r\ntortoise beetles, in which the outer shell overlaps the body, and the\r\nlimbs are susceptible of being drawn entirely within it. The rim is\r\nfrequently of a different tint from the centre, and one species which I\r\nhave seen is quite startling from the brilliancy of its colouring, which\r\ngives it the appearance of a ruby inclosed in a frame of pearl; but this\r\nwonderful effect disappears immediately on the death of the\r\ninsect.\"[216]\r\n\r\nIf we turn to the vegetable world, what a profusion of beauty do we\r\nfind! Exquisite are the tiny Mosses, when the fogs and rains of winter,\r\nso inimical to other vegetation, have quickened them into verdure and\r\nfruit. How they spread along the hedgerow banks in soft fleeces of vivid\r\nemerald, and shoot up their slender stalks, each crowned with its tiny\r\nurn, and wearing its fairy nightcap! Beautiful are the tiny dark-green\r\nfeather-like leaves of the Forkmoss crowded on the clayey bank;\r\nbeautiful the wild sprays of the plumy Hypnum; and beautiful the little\r\nround velvet cushions of Tortula, that grow on every old wall-top.\r\n\r\n      \"The tiny moss, whose silken verdure clothes\r\n      The time-worn rock, and whose bright capsules rise,\r\n      Like fairy urns, on stalks of golden sheen,\r\n      Demand our admiration and our praise,\r\n      As much as cedar kissing the blue sky\r\n      Or Krubul's giant-flower. God made them all,\r\n      And what _He_ deigns to make should ne'er be deem'd\r\n      Unworthy of our study.\"\r\n\r\nExquisite too are the Ferns, in their arching fronds, so richly cut in\r\nelegant tracery. See a fine crown of the Lady Fern in a shaded\r\nDevonshire lane, and confess that grace and beauty are triumphant there.\r\nAnd in the saturated atmosphere of the tropical islands, where these\r\nlovely plants form a very large proportion of the entire vegetation, and\r\nsome of them rise on slender stems thirty or forty feet in altitude,\r\nfrom the summit of which the wide-spreading fronds arch gracefully on\r\nevery side, like a vast umbrella of twinkling verdure, through whose\r\nfilagree work the sunbeams are sparkling,--what can be more charming\r\nthan Ferns?\r\n\r\nThe queenly Palms, too, are models of stately beauty. Linnæus called\r\nthem _vegetabilium principes_; and, when we see them in some noble\r\nconservatory of adequate dimensions, such as the glass palm-house at\r\nKew, crowded side by side, with their crowned heads, and lofty stature,\r\nand proud, erect bearing, we are involuntarily reminded of the monarchs\r\nof many kingdoms met in august conclave.\r\n\r\n      \"Lo! higher still the stately palm-trees rise,\r\n        Chequering the clouds with their unbending stems,\r\n      And o'er the clouds, amid the dark-blue skies,\r\n        Lifting their rich unfading diadems.\r\n          How calm and placidly they rest\r\n          Upon the heaven's indulgent breast,\r\n      As if their branches never breeze had known!\r\n          Light bathes them aye in glancing showers,\r\n          And Silence, 'mid their lofty bowers,\r\n      Sits on her moveless throne.\"\r\n\r\nAre the Grasses worthy of mention for their beauty? Surely, yes. Many of\r\nthem display a downy lightness exquisitely lovely, as the common\r\nFeather-grass. The golden panicles of the great Quake-grass, so\r\ncuriously compacted and hanging in stalks of so hair-like a tenuity as\r\nto nod and tremble with the slightest motion, how beautiful are these!\r\nAnd the satiny plumes of the Pampas-grass projecting from the clump of\r\nleaves form a fine object. But the Bamboos, those great arborescent\r\nGrasses of the tropics, form a characteristic feature of the vegetation\r\nof those regions, of almost unexampled magnificence. I have seen them in\r\ntheir glory, and can sympathise with the philosophical Humboldt in the\r\npowerful effect which the grandeur of the Bamboo produces on the poetic\r\nmind. It is an object never to be forgotten, especially when growing in\r\nthose isolated clumps, that look like tufts of ostrich-plumes magnified\r\nto colossal dimensions. A thousand of these noble reeds standing in\r\nclose array, each four or five inches in the diameter of its stem, and\r\nrising in erect dignity to the height of forty feet, and all waving\r\ntheir tufted summits in diverging curves moved by every breeze,--form,\r\nindeed, a magnificent spectacle. Growing in the most rocky situations,\r\nthe Bamboo is frequently planted in Jamaica on the very apex of those\r\nconical hills which form so remarkable a feature in the landscape of the\r\ninterior, and to which its noble tufts constitute a most becoming crown.\r\n\r\nMr Ellis thus describes the elegance of these magnificent Grasses in\r\nMadagascar:--\r\n\r\n\"The base of the hills and the valleys were covered with the Bamboo,\r\nwhich was far more abundant than during any former part of the journey.\r\nThere were at least four distinct varieties: one a large growing kind,\r\nerect nearly to the point; a second smaller, seldom rising much above\r\ntwenty feet in height, bushy at the base, and gracefully bending down\r\nits tapering point. A third kind rose in single cane, almost without a\r\nleaf, to the height of thirty feet or more; or, bending over, formed a\r\nperfectly circular arch. I also saw a Bamboo growing as a creeper, with\r\nsmall short joints, feathered with slender leafy branches at every\r\njoint, and stretching in festoons from tree to tree along the side of\r\nthe road, or hanging suspended in single lines from a projecting branch,\r\nand swinging gently with the passing breeze. The appearance of the\r\nBamboo when growing is exceedingly graceful. Sometimes the canes, as\r\nthick as a man's arm at the base, rise forty or fifty feet high, fringed\r\nat the joints, which are two or three feet apart, with short branches of\r\nlong, lance-shaped leaves. The smaller kinds, which abound most in this\r\nregion, are still more elegant; and the waving of the canes, with their\r\nattenuated but feathery-looking points, bending down like a plume, and\r\nthe tremulous quivering, even in the slightest breeze, of their long,\r\nslender leaves, present ever-varying aspects of beauty; and, combined\r\nwith the bright-green colour of the Bamboo-cane and leaf, impart an\r\nindescribable charm to the entire landscape.\"[217]\r\n\r\nGlorious in loveliness are the _Musaceæ_, the Plantains and Bananas of\r\nthe hot regions. Humboldt calls the Banana \"one of the noblest and most\r\nlovely of vegetable productions;\" and truly its enormous, flag-like\r\nleaves of the richest green, permeated by nervures running transversely\r\nin exactly parallel lines, and arching out in every direction from the\r\nsucculent, spongy, sheathed stem, command our admiration, apart from the\r\nbeauty of their flowers, or the importance of their fruit.\r\n\r\nIn a description of a mountain scene in Tahiti, drawn with graphic power\r\nby Charles Darwin, the Banana forms a prominent element:--\"I could not\r\nlook on the surrounding plants without admiration. On every side were\r\nforests of Banana; the fruit of which, though serving for food in\r\nvarious ways, lay in heaps decaying on the ground.... As the evening\r\ndrew to a close, I strolled beneath the gloomy shade of the Bananas up\r\nthe course of the stream. My walk was soon brought to a close, by coming\r\nto a waterfall between two and three hundred feet high; and again above\r\nthis there was another.... In the little recess where the water fell, it\r\ndid not appear that a breath of wind had ever blown. The thin edges of\r\nthe great leaves of the Banana, damp with spray, were unbroken, instead\r\nof being, as is so generally the case, split into a thousand shreds.\r\nFrom our position, almost suspended on the mountain-side, there were\r\nglimpses into the depths of the neighbouring valleys: and the lofty\r\npoints of the central mountains, towering up within sixty degrees of the\r\nzenith, hid half the evening sky. Thus seated, it was a sublime\r\nspectacle to watch the shades of night gradually obscuring the last and\r\nhighest pinnacles.\"[218]\r\n\r\nThis scene must have been one of surpassing sublimity and loveliness.\r\nFew doubtless have ever beheld anything that can be compared with it.\r\nBut perhaps many have felt--I have, often,--that there are occasions in\r\nwhich the sense of the beautiful in nature becomes almost painfully\r\noverpowering. I have gazed on some very lovely prospects, bathed perhaps\r\nin the last rays of the evening sun, till my soul seemed to struggle\r\nwith a very peculiar undefinable sensation, as if longing for a power to\r\nenjoy, which I was conscious I did not possess, and which found relief\r\nonly in tears. I have felt conscious that there were elements of\r\nenjoyment and admiration there, which went far beyond my capacity of\r\nenjoying and admiring; and I have delighted to believe, that, by and by,\r\nwhen, in the millennial kingdom of Jesus, and, still more, in the\r\nremoter future, in the dispensation of the fulness of times, the\r\nearth--the \"_new_ earth,\"--shall be endowed with a more than\r\nparadisaical glory, there will be given to redeemed man a greatly\r\nincreased power and capacity for drinking in, and enjoying the augmented\r\nloveliness. Doubtless the risen and glorified saints, sitting with the\r\nKing of kings upon His throne, will have the senses of their spiritual\r\nbodies expanded in capacity beyond what we can now form the slightest\r\nconception of; and as all then will be enjoyment of the most exquisite\r\nkind, and absolutely unalloyed by interruption or satiety,--the eye will\r\nat length be satisfied with seeing, and the ear be satisfied with\r\nhearing. \"_I shall be satisfied_, when I awake up with thy likeness.\"\r\n\r\nIt is in _Flowers_ that the beauty of the vegetable world chiefly\r\nresides; and I shall now therefore select a few examples from the\r\nprofusion of lovely objects which the domain proper of Flora presents to\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThat very curious tribe of plants, the _Orchideæ_, so remarkable for the\r\nmimic forms of other things, that its blossoms delight to assume, is\r\nalso pre-eminent in gorgeous beauty. Take the _Sobraliæ_,--terrestrial\r\nspecies from Central America, where they form extensive thickets,\r\ngrowing thrice the height of man, with slender nodding stems, and\r\nalternate willow-like leaves, and terminal racemes loaded with\r\nsnow-white, pink, crimson, or violet flowers.[219] Imagine the crushing\r\nthrough \"thickets\" of the lovely _S. macrantha_! The large lily-like\r\nblossoms of this species are eight inches long, and as many wide, of the\r\nrichest purple crimson, and of the most elegant shape conceivable, with\r\nthe lip so wrapped round the column as to appear funnel-shaped, bordered\r\nby an exquisitely-cut fringe.\r\n\r\nI have before alluded to _Phajus Tankervilliæ_, that rich lily-like\r\nspike of blossom which I stumbled on in the midst of a dense thicket in\r\nthe mountains of Jamaica. Another terrestrial genus of great elegance is\r\n_Cypripedium_, of which we have one native species, _C. calceolus_, the\r\nyellow lady's slipper,--one of the most charming, but the rarest and\r\nmost difficult of propagation, of British plants. But this is far\r\nexcelled in beauty by many of the exotic species; as, for example, the\r\nexquisite _C. barbatum_ from Malacca. The very foliage is princely; for\r\nthe nervures and cross-veins form a network pattern of dark green upon\r\nthe light green area of each broad leaf. The blossom rears up its noble\r\nhead erect, with its standard-petal of white, striped with green and\r\npurple, the wing-petals studded with purple tubercles along their edges,\r\nand the lip or slipper-shaped petal of a dark purple hue.\r\n\r\nMy readers may have occasionally noticed a little plant, in the most\r\nrecherchées stove-houses, of so much delicacy and preciousness that it\r\nis invariably kept under a bell-glass. I mean the _Anæctochilus\r\nsetaceus_. It belongs to this tribe, and is a terrestrial species,\r\ngrowing about the roots of the trees in the humid forests of Ceylon. Its\r\nexquisite loveliness has attracted the attention of even the apathetic\r\nCingalese, who call it by the poetical epithet of _Wanna Raja_, or king\r\nof the forest. It does not appear to possess any peculiar attractiveness\r\nin its blossoms,--indeed, I have never seen it in flower; but its\r\nleaves, which grow in opposite pairs, are elegantly heart-shaped, of a\r\ndeep rich greenish-brown hue, approaching to black, of a surface which\r\nresembles velvet, reticulated all over with pale golden veins, which,\r\nbeing numerous and minute, have a very charming appearance, somewhat\r\nlike the pale network on black patches which we see in the wings of some\r\ndragon-flies.\r\n\r\nThe epiphyte Orchids are also magnificent in beauty. One of the\r\nhandsomest genera is _Dendrobium_, containing many species, mostly\r\nnatives of Southern Asia and the great islands. Perhaps the finest of\r\nall is _D. nobile_, of which the sepals and petals are greenish-white,\r\ntipped with rich purple, and the downy tube-like lip is of the same\r\nregal hue in the interior, with a pale yellow margin.\r\n\r\nBy the side of this you may set the lovely _Huntleya violacea_, one of\r\nthe discoveries of Sir R. Schomburgk in the interior of Guiana. Its\r\nbroad wavy petals of the softest richest violet, \"vary in intensity from\r\ndeepest sapphire to the mild iridescence of opal.\" This fine flower has\r\na melancholy interest from its being associated with the death of Sir\r\nRobert's friend and fellow-servant, Mr Reiss. The gorgeous scenes of\r\ntropical vegetation in which the plant was found, and the sad accident,\r\nare thus depicted by the accomplished traveller:--\r\n\r\n\"I discovered the _Huntleya violacea_ for the first time in October\r\n1837, then on my ascent of the river Essequibo. The large cataract,\r\nCumaka Toto, or Silk Cotton Fall, obliged us to unload our corials, and\r\nto transport the luggage overland, in order to avoid the dangers which a\r\nmass of water, at once so powerful and rapid, and bounded by numerous\r\nrocks, might offer to our ascent. While the Indians were thus occupied,\r\nI rambled about one of the small islands, which the diverging arms of\r\nthe river formed in their descent, and the vegetation of which had that\r\npeculiar lively appearance which is so characteristic of the vicinity of\r\ncataracts, where a humid cloud, the effects of the spray, always hovers\r\naround them. Blocks of syenite were heaped together; and while their\r\nblack shining surface contrasted strongly with the whitish foam of the\r\ntorrent, and with the curly waves beating against the rocky barriers--as\r\nif angry at the boundary which they attempted to set to the incensed\r\nelement--their dome-shaped summits were adorned with a vegetation at\r\nonce rich and interesting. _Heliconias_, _Tillandsias_, _Bromelias_,\r\n_Ferns_, _Pothos_, _Cyrtopodiums_, _Epidendrums_, _Peperomias_, all\r\nappeared to struggle for the place which so small a surface afforded to\r\nthem. The lofty mountains, Akaywanna, Comute, or Taquia, and Tuasinki,\r\nrecede and form an amphitheatre, affording a highly interesting scene,\r\nand no doubt the most picturesque of that part of the river Essequibo.\r\n\r\n\"I was attracted by a number of _Oncidium altissimum_ which covered one\r\nof the rocky piles, and astonished me by their long stems and bright\r\ncolour of their flowers, when my attention was more powerfully attracted\r\nby a plant, the appearance of which, although different from the\r\npseudo-bulbous tribe, proclaimed, nevertheless, that it belonged to that\r\ninteresting family, the _Orchideæ_. The specimens were numerous; and\r\nclothed almost, with their vivid green, the rugged and dark trunks of\r\nthe gigantic trees, which contributed to the majestic scene around me.\r\nIt was not long before I discovered one of these plants in flower. It\r\nwas as singular as it was new to me;--the sepals and petals of a rich\r\npurple and velvet-like appearance; the helmet, to which form the column\r\nbore the nearest resemblance, of the same colour; the labellum striated\r\nwith yellow.\r\n\r\n\"In the sequel of my expeditions, I found it generally in the vicinity\r\nof cataracts, where a humid vapour is constantly suspended, and where\r\nthe rays of the sun are scarcely admitted through a thick canopy of\r\nfoliage. I traced the _Huntleya_ from the sixth parallel of latitude to\r\nthe shady mountains of the Acaria chain near the equator; but in its\r\nfullest splendour it appeared at one of the small islands among the\r\nChristmas cataracts in the river Berbice. There is a melancholy\r\ncircumstance connected with the plant, which its appearance never fails\r\nto recall to my memory. Their singular beauty at this spot induced my\r\nfriend, Mr Reiss, who accompanied me as a volunteer during the\r\nunfortunate expedition up the river Berbice, to draw and paint it on the\r\nspot. He was yet occupied with this task when the last of our canoes was\r\nto descend the dangerous cataract. He arose from his occupation,\r\ndesirous to descend with the Indians in the canoe, although against my\r\nwish, but he persisted. The canoe approached the fall; it upset; and, of\r\nthirteen persons who were in it at the time, he was the only one who\r\npaid the rash attempt with his life. He is now buried opposite that\r\nisland, the richest vegetable productions of which it was his last\r\noccupation to imitate on paper and in colours.\"[220]\r\n\r\nWe might linger long on these flowers of strange loveliness, but space\r\ncompels us to forsake them and to turn to some other examples in the\r\nwide range of Flora's domains. How glorious a sight must be the sheeted\r\nRhododendrons of the Himalaya peaks, on whose lofty elevations Dr Hooker\r\nfound these fine plants in great prominence, \"clothing the\r\nmountain-slopes with a deep-green mantle, glowing with bells of\r\nbrilliant colours; of the eight or ten species growing here, [on the\r\nZemir, in Sikkim, twelve thousand feet above the sea,] every bush was\r\nloaded with as great a profusion of blossoms as are their northern\r\ncongeners in our English gardens!\"[221]\r\n\r\nThe noblest of the genus is that which is dedicated to Lady Dalhousie.\r\nIt is an epiphyte, being always found growing, like the Orchids, among\r\nmosses and ferns, upon the trunks of large trees, especially oaks and\r\nmagnolias, at an elevation of from seven to ten thousand feet. In this\r\nparticular, in the fragrance of its noble white blossoms, in its slender\r\nhabit, in the whorled arrangement of its branches, and in the length of\r\ntime during which it continues in flower in its native regions, viz.,\r\nfrom April to July, it differs from all its fellows of the same genus\r\nthat inhabit northern India.\r\n\r\nThe flowers are four inches in length and four in diameter, with a broad\r\ntrumpet lip. Their colour is pure white, assuming a delicate rosy tinge\r\nas they become old, and sometimes becoming spotted with orange. They\r\nhave an odour which resembles that of the lemon.\r\n\r\nOf this and the following species Dr Hooker writes from Dorjiling, seven\r\nthousand feet above the sea:--\"On the branches of the immense\r\npurple-flowered magnolia, (_M. Campbellii_,) and those of oaks and\r\nlaurels, _Rhododendron Dalhousiæ_ grows epiphytally, a slender shrub\r\nbearing from three to six white lemon-scented bells, four and a half\r\ninches long and so many broad, at the end of each branch. In the same\r\nwoods the scarlet Rhododendron (_R. arboreum_) is very scarce, and is\r\noutvied by the great _R. argenteum_, which grows as a tree, forty feet\r\nhigh, with magnificent leaves twelve to fifteen inches long, deep green\r\nwrinkled above and silvery below, while the flowers are as large as\r\nthose of _R. Dalhousiæ_ and grow more in a cluster. I know nothing of\r\nthe kind that exceeds in beauty the flowering branch of _R. argenteum_,\r\nwith its wide-spreading foliage and glorious mass of flowers.\"[222]\r\n\r\nThe latter, which is nearly equal to _R. Dalhousiæ_ in the size of its\r\nblossoms, and perhaps superior to it in other respects, is another\r\nwhite-flowered species. It is, as described above, a tree with large\r\nmassive leaves of a silvery tint beneath. When young, they are\r\nexquisitely beautiful, being encased in long flesh-coloured cones of\r\nlarge scales, of very ornamental appearance. The flowers are three\r\ninches long, forming a compact globose head.\r\n\r\nThey secrete a large quantity of honey, which is said to be poisonous,\r\nas is also that of _R. Dalhousiæ_.\r\n\r\nThe grandeur and beauty of the same genus are celebrated by Mr Low, as\r\nhe saw the species growing in Borneo, where too their parasitic\r\ncharacter struck him, as it had done Dr Hooker:--\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the most gorgeous of the native plants are the various species\r\nof the genus _Rhododendron_, which here assume a peculiar form, being\r\nfound epiphytal upon the trunks of trees, as the genera of the tribe\r\n_Orchidace{oe}_. This habit, induced probably by the excessive moisture of\r\nthe climate, is not, however, confined to the Ericaceous plants, but\r\nalso prevails with the genera _Fagria_, _Combretum_, and many others,\r\nusually terrestrial; the roots of the Rhododendrons, instead of being,\r\nas with the species [which are] inhabitants of cold climates, small and\r\nfibrous, become large and fleshy, winding round the trunks of the forest\r\ntrees; the most beautiful one is that which I have named in compliment\r\nto Mr Brooke. Its large heads of flowers are produced in the greatest\r\nabundance throughout the year: they much exceed in size those of any\r\nknown species, frequently being formed of eighteen flowers, which are of\r\nall shades, from pale and rich yellow to a rich reddish salmon-colour;\r\nin the sun, the flowers sparkle with a brilliancy resembling that of\r\ngold dust.\r\n\r\n\"Four other species which I discovered are very gorgeous, but of\r\ndifferent colours, one being crimson and another red, and the third a\r\nrich tint between these two: of the fourth I have not yet seen the\r\nflowers.\"[223]\r\n\r\nTake an example from another order. The Lightning-tree of Madagascar\r\nrises before us in the graphic pages of Mr Ellis:--\r\n\r\n\"But the most magnificent objects were the fine trees of _Astrapæa\r\nWallichii_, or _viscosa_. The name of this Malagasy plant was derived\r\nfrom the word for lightning, on account of the brilliancy of its\r\nflowers; and Sir Joseph Paxton and Dr Lindley have thus spoken of _A.\r\nWallichii_:--'One of the finest plants ever introduced. And when loaded\r\nwith its magnificent flowers, we think nothing can exceed its grandeur.'\r\nI had seen a good-sized plant growing freely at Mauritius, but here it\r\nwas in its native home, luxuriating on the banks of the stream, its\r\ntrunk a foot in diameter, its broad-leaved branches stretching over the\r\nwater, and its large, pink, globular, composite[224] flowers, three or\r\nfour inches in diameter, suspended at the end of a fine down-covered\r\nstalk, nine inches or a foot in length. These, hanging by hundreds along\r\nthe course of the stream, surpassed anything of the kind I had seen, or\r\ncould possibly have imagined. I frequently met with the _Astrapæa_\r\nafterwards, but always growing near the water, and its branches\r\nfrequently stretching over a lake or river.\"[225]\r\n\r\nThe Leguminous or Papilionaceous order presents many plants of striking\r\nbeauty, both in foliage, which is often of extreme lightness and\r\nelegance, and also in blossom. They are among the gayest and most\r\ngraceful of plants in all regions. The magnificent vegetation of the\r\nMauritius contains one of notable glory, the Flamboyant, thus noticed by\r\nEllis:--\r\n\r\n\"Conspicuous beyond all the rest is the stately and gorgeous _Poinciana\r\nregia_, compact-growing and regular in form, but retaining something of\r\nthe acacia habit, rising sometimes to the height of forty or fifty feet,\r\nand, between the months of December and April, presenting, amidst its\r\ndelicate pea-green pinnated leaves, one vast pyramid of bunches of\r\nbright, dazzling scarlet flowers. Seen sometimes over the tops of the\r\nhouses, and at others in an open space, standing forth in truly regal\r\nsplendour, this is certainly one of the most magnificent of trees. Its\r\ncommon name is _mille fleurs_, or _flamboyant_.\"[226]\r\n\r\nI have had the delight of seeing the _Poinciana pulcherrima_ in Jamaica,\r\nwhere it goes by the name of Flower-feuce, or sometimes, the \"Pride of\r\nBarbadoes.\" It is, when in flower, a gorgeous mass of scarlet and\r\norange, and it seemed to me the most magnificent thing in its way, that\r\nI had ever seen. It does not, however, attain the dimensions of its\r\nantipode, rarely exceeding those of a large shrub.\r\n\r\nI know not what the Burmese tree is, which is alluded to in the\r\nfollowing extracts from letters which I have received from my esteemed\r\nfriend, Captain G. E. Bulger, of the 10th Regiment:--\r\n\r\n\"I shall be exceedingly obliged by your telling me whether you are\r\nfamiliar with the tree known in the West Indies and South America as the\r\n'Bois Immortel;' and whether you think the leaf herewith sent belongs to\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"During the cool season in Burmah, the forest presents a gorgeous sight,\r\nfrom the multitude of scarlet blossoms which a large kind of tree puts\r\nforth; and I am strongly inclined to think that this splendid ornament\r\nof the jungles is, at all events, allied to the Bois Immortel of the\r\nWestern World.\r\n\r\n\"The tree I speak of begins to flower about the middle of December, at\r\nwhich time the leaves commence to wither and drop off. By the end of\r\nJanuary, when it is in full bloom, there is hardly a leaf remaining, but\r\nit continues one mass of scarlet blossom until March. The flower is\r\nshaped like that of the pea.\r\n\r\n\"If you can enlighten me on this point I shall be indeed very much\r\nobliged.\"\r\n\r\nI was compelled to confess my ignorance even of the South American\r\nbeauty, and my friend thus replied:--\r\n\r\n\"I first read of the 'Bois Immortel' in 'Waterton's Wanderings,' and I\r\nsubsequently saw a coloured representation of the tree in Mr Gould's\r\nmagnificent work on Humming-Birds. I think the specific name was also\r\ngiven in that work, but it is some time ago, and I have almost forgotten\r\nwhat it was like. Since I saw these two works, I have heard officers\r\nspeak of the splendour of the South American forests during the season\r\nof 'Le Bois Immortel,' and have heard more than one say that they\r\nbelieved nothing on earth could be more magnificent than 'matchless\r\nTrinidad' when these trees are in full bloom. The autumnal beauty of the\r\nNorth American woods is, doubtless, familiar to you, and I question very\r\nmuch whether there is anything richer or more lovely to be found even in\r\nSouth America.\"\r\n\r\nEven the humblest orders of plants have the element of beauty bestowed\r\non them with no niggard hand. Who would have expected, among the\r\n_Chenopodeæ_, and, above all, in the lowly little Saltworts, to find\r\nsuch a glowing scene as Mr Atkinson describes?--\r\n\r\n\"We were now on a heavy sandy steppe--part of the Sackha Desert, which\r\nextends into the Gobi--and vegetation was so very scant, that even the\r\nsteppe grass had disappeared. The _Salsola_ was growing in a broad belt\r\naround the small salt lakes, its colour varying from orange to the\r\ndeepest crimson. These lakes have a most singular appearance when seen\r\nat a distance. The sparkling of the crystallised salt, which often\r\nreflected the deep crimson around, gave them the appearance of diamonds\r\nand rubies set in a gorgeous framework. I rode round several times,\r\nadmiring their beauty, and regretting that it was impossible to stay and\r\nvisit a large lake, which I observed, ten or fifteen versts distant,\r\nsurrounded with green, orange, and crimson.\"[227]\r\n\r\nThe microscope, too, will bring out beauties in flowers which the\r\nunassisted eye is incompetent fully to recognise. If we take a scarlet\r\nGeranium, or a purple Heartsease, the eye is delighted with the\r\nbrilliancy of the colouring; but on placing a petal of either on a slip\r\nof glass, under a pretty high magnifying power, and reflecting the full\r\nrays of the sun through the object, the rich gorgeousness of the hue,\r\nthe sparkling gem-like radiance of the surface, and the\r\nexquisitely-regular form of the round cells, with their clear\r\ninterstices, form a spectacle of glorious beauty that almost surpasses\r\nthe conception of one who has not seen it.\r\n\r\nI shall close this chapter, which might easily have been expanded into a\r\nvolume, with a reference to an humble and minute plant, whose fairy\r\nloveliness, combined with an almost unkillable hardiness of\r\nconstitution, has won for it a place in every garden, however\r\nunpretending, and however ungenial in its locality,--the London-pride.\r\nThis exquisite little Saxifrage, general favourite as it is, requires\r\nthe microscope to bring out its beauties to advantage, but under a good\r\ninstrument you cannot fail to be charmed with it. I have one before me\r\nat this moment, and will describe what I see.\r\n\r\nFirst, I notice, on a cursory glance, that the whole plant is clothed\r\nwith tiny hairs; I take one of the flower-stalks and examine these with\r\na power of three hundred diameters. Each now becomes a stem of\r\nglass-like clearness, tapering upwards to a point, where it bears a\r\nrichly crimson cup, and in this is seated a globule of colourless\r\nglass, just as an acorn sits in its shell. The multitude of these\r\norgans--glandular hairs, the botanist calls them--standing up side by\r\nside, rising to varying heights, and displaying various degrees of\r\ndevelopment, is a very pleasing sight.\r\n\r\nI turn to an unopened bud, putting on a lower power, and viewing it as\r\nan opaque object, with reflected light by the aid of the Lieberkuhn.\r\nHere are the parting sepals of the calyx, painted with rose-pink and\r\npea-green, and studded all over with the knobbed hairs just noticed; the\r\ncoloured surface is rough with granules, but it is the roughness of\r\nglass, for every knob gleams and sparkles with light. The corolla, a\r\nlittle white ball, displays its petals smoothly folded over each other,\r\nand their surface has the same appearance of granular glass as that of\r\nthe calyx.\r\n\r\nBut now let me examine this blossom just expanded this morning,--the\r\nvery first of the season, by the way. I must have a low power for this,\r\neighty diameters, or so. Oh, how exquisite! The little saucer of five\r\noval petals, each of snowy whiteness, bearing its bow of lovely crimson\r\nspecks, with a spot of gamboge-yellow for the chord, and the whole\r\nsparkling with glassy points as before. The pale red germen in the\r\ncentre, rising into two points of snow, their rosy tips pressed close\r\ntogether, as if the twins were kissing. The ten stamens, five short\r\nalternating with five long ones, and each bearing its pretty\r\nkidney-shaped anther of pale scarlet. No; all are not kidney-shaped; for\r\nhere is one which has burst, and the grains of red pollen are seen\r\ncovering its rough purple surface; and here is one stamen from the\r\npoint of which the anther has gone, leaving only two or three\r\npollen-grains adhering. Behind all, I see the sepals of the calyx,\r\npeeping out between the petals, and forming a fine dark background for\r\nthem, and for the longer filaments.\r\n\r\nAnd now I say to my readers, one and all,--you may not have the\r\nopportunity to examine the glorious tropical Orchids, or the gorgeous\r\nFlamboyant, but go and pluck a flower of the London-pride, and you will\r\nhave before your eyes such a production of Divine handiwork as may well\r\nexcite the admiration and adoration of an angel.\r\n\r\n[203] Rev. v. 11.\r\n\r\n[204] Edwards's _Voyage up the Amazon_, 194.\r\n\r\n[205] _Travels on the Amazon and Negro_, 222.\r\n\r\n[206] _Voy. à la Nouv.

Multitudes of animals do not walk on the ground, or swim in the\r\nwaters, or fly in the air, but find the scene of their abode on or in\r\nthe bodies of other animals. Multitudes of plants do not grow out of the\r\nsoil, but attach themselves to other plants, and draw their sustenance\r\nand support thence. Nay, there are parasites upon parasites, and this,\r\naccording to Hood, in an infinitely descending series.\r\n\r\n      \"Great fleas have little fleas\r\n        Upon their backs to bite 'em;\r\n      And little fleas have lesser fleas;\r\n        And so _ad infinitum_.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps the poet's imagination ran a little ahead of his science here;\r\nbut the idea of an _infinite_ succession of parasites, like nests of\r\npill-boxes, is surely a funny one. There is nothing funny, however, in\r\nthe thought \"that even man,\" who was made in the image of God, \"bears\r\nabout in his vital organs various forms of loathsome creatures, which\r\nriot on his fluids, and consume the very substance of his tissues while\r\nensconced where no efforts of his can dislodge them, no application\r\ndestroy them. So it is; and few physical facts are better calculated to\r\nhumble man, and stain the pride of his glory, than to feel that he may\r\nat any moment be nourishing a horrid tape-worm in his alimentary canal,\r\nor that his muscles may be filled with millions of microscopic\r\n_trichinæ_.\r\n\r\nI will not dwell on these; though, if I were writing a book of pure\r\nscience, there is a wondrous array of facts of the most striking and\r\ninteresting character, connected with the structure, the metamorphoses,\r\nand the habits, of the Entozoic Worms, which I might present to my\r\nreaders. It is more pleasant to consider other facts, perhaps not less\r\nmarvellous, which, as they do not come quite so home to our personal\r\nfeelings, will not excite horror and disgust in our minds.\r\n\r\nThe _economy_ of creation is remarkable. He who, by His divine\r\nmanipulation converted five loaves and two small fishes into a hearty\r\nmeal for five thousand men, besides women and children, and who could,\r\nwith the same ease have made them a hundred times as much, said, when\r\nthe meal was over, \"Gather up the fragments, that nothing be lost.\" And,\r\nwhen He spread the earth with life, though His resources were infinite,\r\nHe ordained that one object, itself healthfully enjoying life, and\r\nfulfilling its own proper ends of being, should be a microcosm, on which\r\nanother range of life should find its sphere, and on which it should\r\ndisport, as on an independent world. I have often admired, in the\r\ngorgeous tropical forests, what a wilderness of vegetation a single\r\ntree supports; what numbers of orchids and wild pines spring out of the\r\nforks, what creepers and lianes hang and twine about its branches, what\r\nelegant ferns cluster on the horizontal limbs, what snake-like cacti\r\ncreep from bough to bough, what mosses, and jungermanniæ crowd in every\r\ncrevice, what many-coloured lichens stud the rugged bark! And then\r\nanimal life is swarming in all this great field of parasitic vegetation.\r\nReptiles and birds, snails and slugs, insects and millepedes, and\r\nspiders and worms nestle by thousands in such prolific situations, so\r\nthat a great old tropical tree, one of the giant figs or cotton-trees,\r\nis a very museum in itself.\r\n\r\nAnd in my wanderings along the sea-edge here at home how often have I\r\nbeen amazed at the diverse population, plant and animal, which crowds a\r\nsingle oar-weed, or tangle! The stem fringed with delicate red-weeds, as\r\nthe minute _Rhodymeniæ_, and _Polysyphoniæ_, and _Callithamnia_; the\r\ntortuous roots studded with Anemones, with _Flustræ_ and _Lepraliæ_, and\r\nmultitudes of other _Polyzoa_, with tiny Polypes of many kinds, with\r\nBarnacles and Limpets, and sheltering small Crustacea, and Mites, and\r\nAnnelids by scores.\r\n\r\nMr Darwin has an interesting passage on this subject, evoked by the\r\nprofusion of parasitic life on the long sea-weed of Cape Horn\r\n(_Macrocystis_). \"The number of living creatures\" he remarks, \"whose\r\nexistence intimately depends on the Kelp is wonderful. A great volume\r\nmight be written, describing the inhabitants of one of these beds of\r\nsea-weed. Almost all the leaves, excepting those that float on the\r\nsurface, are so thickly incrusted with corallines as to be of a white\r\ncolour. We find exquisitely delicate structures, some inhabited by\r\nsimple hydra-like polypi, others by more organised kinds, and beautiful\r\ncompound Ascidiæ. On the leaves also, various patelliform shells,\r\nTrochi, uncovered molluscs, and some bivalves are attached. Innumerable\r\ncrustacea frequent every part of the plant. On shaking the great\r\nentangled roots, a pile of small fish, shells, cuttle-fish, crabs of all\r\norders, sea-eggs, star-fish, beautiful Holuthuriæ, Planariæ, and\r\ncrawling nereidous animals of a multitude of forms, all fall out\r\ntogether. Often as I recurred to a branch of the kelp, I never failed to\r\ndiscover animals of new and curious structure. In Chiloe, where the kelp\r\ndoes not thrive very well, the numerous shells, corallines, and\r\ncrustacea are absent; but there yet remain a few of the Flustraceæ, and\r\nsome compound Ascidiæ; the latter, however, are of different species\r\nfrom those in Terra del Fuego: we here see the fucus possessing a wider\r\nrange than the animals which use it as an abode. I can only compare\r\nthese great aquatic forests of the southern hemisphere, with the\r\nterrestrial ones in the intertropical regions.\r\n\r\n\"Yet if in any country a forest was destroyed, I do not believe nearly\r\nso many species of animals would perish as would here, from the\r\ndestruction of the kelp. Amidst the leaves of this plant numerous\r\nspecies of fish live, which nowhere else could find food or shelter:\r\nwith their destruction the many cormorants and other fishing birds, the\r\notters, seals, and porpoises, would soon perish also; and lastly, the\r\nFuegian savage, the miserable lord of this miserable land, would\r\nredouble his cannibal feast, decrease in numbers, and perhaps cease to\r\nexist.\"\r\n\r\nI have alluded to the epiphytic plants which are so abundant in the\r\ntropics, and which add so greatly to the gorgeousness of the forests\r\nthere. The most remarkable, or, at all events, the best known, of these\r\nare the _Orchideæ_, to which, as I have already had occasion more than\r\nonce to speak of them, I shall do little more than refer here. These\r\nestablish themselves in the forks, upon the greater limbs, and even in\r\nthe roughnesses of the bark of the trunk, adhering by their long,\r\ninterlaced roots, which look like knotted whip-cord, and forming their\r\nbunches of psuedo-bulbs, whence their succulent, thick, but elegant\r\nleaves project,--a great tuft of verdure; and their fantastic\r\nflower-scapes wave in the air or droop with their weight of gorgeous\r\nbloom. Thus they derive their nourishment from the humid atmosphere\r\nalone, being dependent on the friendly tree only for support and\r\nelevation. Humidity seems essential to the vigour of these and most\r\nother forms of parasitic vegetation. In the deep shady, gloomy forests\r\nof Java, which constitute the zone of vegetation around the base of the\r\nmountains, these plants abound, where the air is heavy and damp with the\r\nvapours that cannot ascend, and where the density of the foliage is\r\nalmost frightful; where heat, moisture, and a most extraordinarily deep\r\nand rich vegetable soil combine to produce wood of a fungus-like\r\nsoftness, and an inconceivable abundance of twining plants and\r\nepiphytes. In those forests, more especially where huge fig-trees\r\nconstitute the principal part of the timber, intermingled with the most\r\ntropical forms of vegetation, such as _Sterculiaceæ_, _Sapindaceæ_, and\r\n_Artocarpeæ_, tufts of _Orchideæ_ attain a vast size and luxuriance, in\r\ncompany with Aroideous and Zinziberaceous plants.[228] In Demerara, Mr\r\nHenchman found masses of _Oncidium altissimum_ and _Maxillaria Parkeri_\r\nof wide dimensions, and so densely growing as to defy any attempt at\r\nintrusion; and on the Spanish main he saw the _Epidendrum_ known as the\r\n\"Spread Eagle\" clasping enormous trees, and covering them from the top\r\nto the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe fig-trees, which are among the most gigantic of the tropical\r\nforest-trees, and which support an immense profusion of epiphytes, are\r\nthemselves frequently parasitic and epiphyte in their early condition.\r\nIt is not uncommon in Jamaica to see a network of roots partially\r\nembracing the trunk of some great tree, far up its column, and gradually\r\ncreeping round and downward. I have seen an old wall so covered,\r\npresenting a very curious spectacle. The roots of a wide-spreading fig\r\ngrowing out of the summit of the wall, had spread over its perpendicular\r\nsurface, down to the earth, all in the same plane, clinging to the wall;\r\nthe chief roots were as thick as a man's leg, but subordinate roots had\r\nproceeded from one to another, anastomosing in all directions (if I may\r\nuse such a term), so as to make a most elaborate network of a multitude\r\nof meshes of various angular forms and sizes. These cross-roots were _at\r\neach extremity_ united with the larger roots, and looked as if the whole\r\nnetwork had been skilfully carved out of one solid plank of wood, by\r\ncutting out the areas or meshes, and rounding the component bars; the\r\nvery bark that covered the whole was continuous, where the roots united,\r\nas if they had been always integrally one.\r\n\r\nThe only mode in which I can account for this singular phenomenon is the\r\nfollowing hypothesis:--The seed of the tree was originally deposited on\r\nthe summit of the wall, beneath the eaves. As it germinated, the roots\r\nran down towards the earth, some perpendicularly, some diagonally; but\r\nall creeping along the surface of the wall, no roots having shot out\r\nfrom its perpendicular. As these roots increased, they sent out side\r\nrootlets, which, still running on the face of the wall, by and by came\r\nin contact with another of the primary roots. Then, instead of creeping\r\n_over_ it, as the roots of other trees would have done, the soft tip of\r\nthe rootlet actually united with the substance of the root at the point\r\nof contact, the fibres of the two becoming interlaced, and their united\r\nsurfaces gradually becoming covered with a common bark. The repetition\r\nof this process had produced the very curious wooden net which I have\r\nattempted to describe.\r\n\r\nA still more remarkable example of this parasitic mode of growth I have\r\nseen in the same island. By the side of a mountain road was a large\r\nfig-tree, the base of whose trunk was about thirty feet from the\r\nground. Thence it reared itself up pillar-like towards the heavens, and\r\nspread abroad its vast horizontal array of branches across the road.\r\nFrom the same point there descended to the earth a hollow cone of roots,\r\ninterwoven and anastomosed, especially at the upper parts, in the same\r\nmanner as those of the boiling-house wall, but forming towards the\r\nbottom only three or four flattened irregular columns. Into the area\r\ninclosed by this network of roots a person might enter, for it was about\r\nsix feet wide, and, looking up, behold the base of the trunk eight or\r\nten yards above his head.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of this curious phenomenon depends upon the tendency\r\njust mentioned. On this site once stood a large tree of some other\r\nspecies, probably a cotton-tree (_Eriodendron_), or some other\r\nsoft-timbered kind. The little scarlet berry of a Fig-tree was carried\r\nby some vagrant Banana-bird or Pigeon to its boughs, and there devoured.\r\nAfter the little truant had finished his morsel, he perhaps wiped his\r\nbeak against the rough bark of the trunk, beside the branch on which he\r\nwas seated. Some of the minute seeds, enveloped in mucilage, were thus\r\nleft on the tree, which the rain presently washed down into the broad\r\nconcavity of the forks, where, among moss and rotten leaves, it soon\r\ngerminated and grew. The roots gradually crept down the trunk of the\r\nsupporting tree, closely clinging to its bark, and by their\r\ninterlacement at length formed a living case, enveloping it on every\r\nside, and penetrating the earth around its base. The growth of these,\r\nand also of the inclosed tree, daily induced a tighter and tighter\r\npressure on the latter, which at length arrived at such a degree as to\r\nstop the circulation of the sap between the bark and the wood. Death, of\r\ncourse, was the result, and speedy decay reduced the supporting tree to\r\na heap of mouldering dust: while the parasite, now able to maintain its\r\nown position by its hollow cone of roots, increased in size and\r\nstrength, and overtopped its fellows of the forest;--_a tree standing\r\nupon stilts_.\r\n\r\nA few years ago I was struck with the appearance of an East Indian\r\nspecies of the same genus in one of the conservatories at Kew. Three\r\nshoots had run up the wall, clinging so close, that the leaves looked as\r\nif they were actually glued to the bricks, one over the other, in the\r\nmost regular manner. Yet, on examination, I saw that the leaves did not\r\nadhere at all; the only support was that of the tiny rootlets which\r\nproceeded laterally from each stem, which the leaves concealed. The\r\nappearance of the whole was so curious, with the pale growing bud\r\npeeping out from beneath the topmost leaf, that I was greatly attracted\r\nby it. The base of the plant was in a pot, but the attendant informed me\r\nthat this connexion was about to be cut off, by severing each shoot at\r\nthe point where it first seized the wall. The leaves above this point,\r\nby their superior size and vigour, shewed that the plant was already\r\nindependent of its pot, and that it was capable of supporting itself,\r\nlike a proper air-plant, by imbibition from the atmosphere alone,\r\nneeding nothing more than support in its upright position, which it\r\nobtained from the wall by its clinging aerial rootlets.\r\n\r\nEvery one who has wandered in a primeval forest of the tropics, whether\r\nin the eastern or the western hemisphere, has been struck by the\r\ninconceivable profusion of the climbers and twiners with which the trees\r\nare laced together. They are found from the thickness of a warship's\r\ncable to that of pack-thread; the stronger ones often uncouthly twisted\r\ntogether, and binding tree to tree. They are of the orders\r\n_Malpighaceæ_, _Apocyaneæ_, _Asclepiadeæ_, _Bignoniaceæ_, &c., and often\r\nare adorned with the most brilliant flowers.\r\n\r\nI have before cited descriptions of these wonderful lianes, as they\r\noccur in the forests of South America; my readers may like to peruse Sir\r\nEmerson Tennent's graphic sketch of those of Ceylon:--\r\n\r\n\"It is the trees of older and loftier growth that exhibit the rank\r\nluxuriance of these wonderful epiphytes in the most striking manner.\r\nThey are tormented by climbing plants of such extraordinary dimensions\r\nthat many of them exceed in diameter the girth of a man; and these\r\ngigantic appendages are to be seen surmounting the tallest trees in the\r\nforest, grasping their stems in firm convolutions, and then flinging\r\ntheir monstrous tendrils over the larger limbs till they reach the top,\r\nwhence they descend to the ground in huge festoons, and, after including\r\nanother and another tree in their successive toils, they once more\r\nascend to the summit, and wind the whole into a maze of living network\r\nas massy as if formed by the cable of a line-of-battle ship. When, by\r\nand by, the trees on which this singular fabric has become suspended\r\ngive way under its weight, or sink by their own decay, the fallen trunk\r\nspeedily disappears, while the convolutions of climbers continue to grow\r\non, exhibiting one of the most marvellous and peculiar living mounds of\r\nconfusion that it is possible to fancy. Frequently one of these creepers\r\nmay be seen holding by one extremity the summit of a tall tree, and\r\ngrasping with the other an object at some distance near the earth,\r\nbetween which it is strained as tight and straight as if hauled over a\r\nblock. In all probability the young tendril had been originally fixed in\r\nthis position by the wind, and retained in it till it had gained its\r\nmaturity, where it has the appearance of having been artificially\r\narranged as if to support a falling tree.\"[229]\r\n\r\nLeaving the vegetable world, we may find some very curious examples of\r\nparasitism among Insects. Every one who has paid the slightest attention\r\nto this class of animals is aware that there are slender flies called\r\n_Ichneumons_, whose grubs are hatched and reared in the bodies of other\r\ninsects. Many of these have the ovipositor greatly lengthened, and\r\nprojecting like a very slender needle from the extremity of the abdomen.\r\nIn some species, this needle-like organ is three or four times the\r\nentire length of the body; and this great longitude is intended to reach\r\nthe pupæ of wasps and similar insects which inhabit deep holes. The\r\nneedle itself is well worthy of study. It is not simple, but composed\r\nof two pieces forming a sheath, which open and reveal a central finer\r\nfilament, furnished at its tip (in _Pimpla manifestator_, for example)\r\nwith saw-like teeth. With this instrument, which possesses great\r\nelasticity and flexibility, the insect works, as a carpenter with his\r\nbrad-awl, boring through the clay, with which the wasp has closed up the\r\nhole that contains her grub, until the tip of the ovipositor reaches the\r\nsoft body of the insect. Into this it pierces, and deposits an egg, and\r\nis withdrawn. The slight puncture is scarcely felt by the grub, which\r\ncontinues to eat and grow; the inserted egg, however, presently hatches,\r\nand produces the ichneumon-grub, which begins to feed on the fat of the\r\nwasp-grub, instinctively avoiding the vital parts, until the latter has\r\nattained nearly its full size, and is ready to pass into the pupa state;\r\nwhen, its vigour being gone, it fails to accomplish the metamorphosis,\r\nthe insidious intruder, now also full grown, taking its place, and by\r\nand by issuing from the hole a perfect Ichneumon.\r\n\r\nHow often has the enthusiastic young entomologist been subjected to sore\r\ndisappointment by the parasitic habits of these _Ichneumonidæ_! He has\r\nobtained some fine caterpillar, a great rarity, and by dint of much\r\nsearching of his Westwood or his Stainton, feels quite certain that it\r\nis the larva of some much-prized butterfly. He ascertains its leaf-food;\r\nwhich it eats promisingly; all goes on encouragingly. Surely it cannot\r\nbe far from the pupa state now! When some morning he is horrified to\r\nbehold, instead of the chrysalis, a host of filthy little grubs eating\r\ntheir way out of the skin of his beautiful caterpillar, or covering its\r\nremains with their tiny yellow cocoons.\r\n\r\nSome of these parasites are so minute that their young are hatched and\r\nreared in the _eggs_ of other insects. Bonnet found that the egg of a\r\nbutterfly, itself no bigger than the head of a minikin pin, was\r\ninhabited by several of the stranger grubs; for out of twenty such eggs,\r\nhe says, \"a prodigious quantity\" of the grubs were evolved.\r\n\r\nA very interesting tribe of insects, so diverse from all other known\r\nforms as to constitute an order among themselves, that of the\r\n_Strepsiptera_, passes its youth in the bodies of certain wild bees. Mr\r\nKirby's account of his first detection of one of these, though often\r\nquoted, is so interesting that I must cite it afresh. \"I had previously\r\nobserved,\" he remarks, \"upon bees something that I took to be a kind of\r\nmite (_Acarus_), which appeared to be immovably fixed just at the\r\ninosculations of the dorsal segments of the abdomen. At length, finding\r\nthree or four upon an _Andræna nigroænea_, I determined not to lose the\r\nopportunity of taking one off to examine and describe; but what was my\r\nastonishment when, upon my attempting to disengage it with a pin, I drew\r\nforth from the body of the bee a white fleshy larva, a quarter of an\r\ninch in length, the head of which I had mistaken for an acarus (_bee\r\nlouse_)! After I had examined one specimen, I attempted to extract a\r\nsecond; and the reader may imagine how greatly my astonishment was\r\nincreased, when, after I had drawn it out but a little way, I saw its\r\nskin burst, and a head as black as ink, with large staring eyes and\r\nantennæ, consisting of two branches, break forth, and move itself\r\nquickly from side to side. It looked like a little imp of darkness just\r\nemerged from the infernal regions. My eagerness to set free from its\r\nconfinement this extraordinary animal may be easily conjectured. Indeed,\r\nI was impatient to become better acquainted with so singular a creature.\r\nWhen it was completely disengaged, and I had secured it from making its\r\nescape, I set myself to examine it as accurately as possible; and I\r\nfound, after a careful inquiry, that I had got a nondescript, whose very\r\nclass seemed dubious.\"\r\n\r\nMr Newman, in an essay of much value,[230] has shewn that the larvæ of\r\nthis tribe of insects are born alive, that they attach themselves to the\r\nabdomens of wild bees, nestling among the hair, and that they are thus\r\nintroduced into the nest of the bee. Here it is somewhat uncertain how\r\nthey are sustained at first, for at this time the bee-grubs are not\r\nhatched; probably they remain without food for some days, or devour a\r\nportion of the pollen and honey stored up. As soon, however, as the\r\nbee-grub is hatched, the Stylops-larva undergoes a metamorphosis, sheds\r\nits six legs, and becomes a footless maggot; it pierces the soft skin of\r\nthe bee-grub, and feeds on its juices, till its maturity, as the\r\nIchneumon on the body of the caterpillar.\r\n\r\nWhen the perfect bee emerges in the following spring, it bears the\r\nfull-grown Stylops, protruding from the rings of its abdomen. The latter\r\nis in pupa, all the organs being distinct and separate, but wrapped\r\ntogether, and inclosed in separate pellicles; very soon, it emerges, as\r\ndescribed by Kirby, and escapes, leaving a great unsightly cavity in the\r\nbody of the bee. This is the male: the female never escapes, but lays\r\nits eggs on the bee in which it has been reared, and then dies.\r\n\r\nIn the spring we frequently see among herbage a great uncouth beetle of\r\na dark blue-black hue, with short wing-cases and long, heavy body, which\r\ndischarges drops of yellow fluid when handled, and is therefore called\r\nthe Oil-beetle (_Melöe proscarabæus_). The early stages of this beetle\r\nhave much affinity with those of the _Stylops_. The beetle lays a number\r\nof yellow eggs in a hole in the earth; these produce little active\r\nsix-footed larvæ, resembling lice, which crawl to the summit of\r\ndandelion and other flowers in the sunshine, and await the visit of a\r\nbee. On the arrival of one, the active grub immediately clings to its\r\nbody, and is carried to the nest, not, however, to introduce itself\r\nparasitically into the body of the bee-grub, but to feed on the\r\nprovision which the parent bee has stored up for its own young. Thus it\r\nbecomes very fat, and grows to a size much larger than that of the\r\nfull-grown bee-grub, having early dropped its six long clinging legs,\r\nwhich, having performed their proper function in catching hold of a bee,\r\nare no longer needed. It changes to a perfect beetle in autumn, lies in\r\nthe bee's nest all the winter, and emerges in the spring.\r\n\r\nThe large jelly-like Medusæ which in summer are seen floating around our\r\ncoasts, driving themselves along by alternate contractions and\r\nexpansions of their umbrella, are frequently infested by little\r\ncreatures of widely different organisation, Crustaceans belonging to the\r\ngenera _Hyperia and Metoecus_. On the beautiful _Chrysaora_ of the\r\nsouthern coast I have seen the _Metoecus medusarum_, a little shrimp\r\nabout half-an-inch in length, with enormous lustrous green eyes, which\r\ntakes up his residence in the cavities of the sub-umbrella,--dwelling in\r\nthem as in so many spacious and commodious apartments, of which he takes\r\npossession, evidently without asking leave of the landlord, or paying\r\nhim even the compliment of a peppercorn rent. Here he snugly ensconces\r\nhimself, and feels so much at home, that he is not afraid to leave his\r\ndwelling now and then, to take a swim in the free water, returning to\r\nhis chamber after his exercise; and here he rears his numerous family,\r\nwhich, in the form of tiny white specks, very much unlike their parents\r\nin shape, stud the membranes of the jelly-fish.\r\n\r\nBut, what is stranger still, Mr M'Cready has recently discovered in the\r\nharbour of Charleston in North America, a _Medusa_ which is parasitic\r\nupon another _Medusa_. _Cunina octonaria_ does not swim freely in the\r\nwater, but inhabits the cavity of the bell of _Turritopsis nutricula_.\r\n\"Not only does the latter furnish a shelter and dwelling-place for the\r\nlarvæ during their development; it also serves as their nurse, by\r\nallowing the parasites, whilst adhering by their tentacles, to draw\r\nnourishment out of its mouth by means of a large proboscis. In point of\r\nfact, the relation between them is of so unprecedented a nature, that\r\nthe author may well be excused for having at first taken the impudent\r\nparasite for the gemmiparous progeny of the sheltering Medusa. The\r\nyoungest state of this parasitic Medusa observed by the author formed a\r\nciliated body of clavate form, adhering to the cavity of the bell by\r\nmeans of the slender stalk in which it terminated. The first change\r\nconsists in the emission, from the thick end, of two slender flexible\r\ntentacles, and in the formation of a central cavity by liquefaction. At\r\nthis stage of development, the author frequently observed gemmation\r\ntaking place at the thicker end, sometimes frequently repeated.\r\nSubsequently the number of tentacles becomes doubled. These bend\r\ntogether over the clavate extremity, and are then employed, instead of\r\nthe thin end of the body, in adhering to the cavity of the sheltering\r\nMedusa. The thin extremity then acquires a mouth, and may be recognised\r\nas a stomachal peduncle, which is employed, as above indicated, in\r\nobtaining nourishment. The morphological nature of the proboscis becomes\r\nstill more distinct when, after the lapse of some little time, an\r\nannular fold makes its appearance immediately under the tentacles, which\r\nis recognisable from its form, and from the formation in it of (eight)\r\notolithic capsules, as the first indication of the future bell.\r\nSimultaneously with the otolithic capsules, four rudimentary tentacles\r\nmake their appearance between the four tentacles. The Medusa remains in\r\nthis stage of development for a long time. The bell gradually becomes\r\nmore freely developed, and at last, by the reduction and entire\r\ndisappearance of the stomachal peduncle, becomes the most essential part\r\nof the Medusa, after it has left its previous dwelling-place in the bell\r\nof the _Turritopsis_. The bell nevertheless retains for some time its\r\nearlier lobed form and unequal tentacles.\"[231]\r\n\r\nMore remarkable even than this association is the fact that certain true\r\nFishes habitually reside in the stomachs of star-fishes. This\r\ncircumstance, which had been observed in the Oriental Archipelago by MM.\r\nQuoy and Gaimard, and by Dr Bleeker, has recently been confirmed by Dr\r\nDoleschall, who has written a very interesting Memoir on it.\r\n\r\nThis learned naturalist states that the fact of the connexion between\r\nthe fish and the star-fish is well known to most of the fishermen in\r\nAmboyna, and that he was able to obtain a sufficiency of specimens for\r\nexamination; but as the star-fishes (and with them the fishes) speedily\r\ndied in confinement, he was unable to make continuous observations upon\r\nthem in a living state. Of the results of his observations he gives the\r\nfollowing summary:--\r\n\r\n\"The fish stands to the star-fish in a definite relation which cannot be\r\nthe object of observation. Why the little fish should always seek the\r\nstomachal cavity of one and the same species of star-fish, and not that\r\nof various species, is a mystery. It is well known that Crustaceans of\r\nthe genus _Pagurus_ inhabit the empty shells of Mollusca; but we find\r\non the shore the same species of _Pagurus_ in the shells of the most\r\nvarious genera and species.\r\n\r\n\"I have never met with _Oxybeles gracilis_, on the contrary, in any\r\nother species of star-fish than _Culcita discoidea_. The fish was\r\ndescribed by Bleeker under the above name in 'Natuurkundig Tijdschrift,'\r\nvii., p. 162. The author proceeds to state that neither he nor any one\r\nelse in Amboyna has ever captured the fish under other circumstances, or\r\nwhile swimming freely in the sea; but upon this Dr Bleeker remarks that\r\nmany of his specimens of _Fierasfer Brandesii_, and all those of\r\n_Fierasfer (Oxybeles) gracilis_ and _F. lumbricoides_, were obtained by\r\nhim along with other fishes, and were probably taken while swimming\r\nfreely in the sea.\r\n\r\n\"Upon the habits of _Oxybeles gracilis_ the author goes on to say that\r\nit is certain that this animal passes the greater part of its existence\r\nin the stomach of the star-fish, rarely shewing itself outside of this,\r\nand then probably at night. That it does come out occasionally, appears\r\nfrom the fact that in two cases the author observed the fish with a\r\nportion of its body outside the cavity of the star-fish, and in the act\r\nof creeping in.\r\n\r\n\"The same observations shewed that the fish, in returning to its\r\nconcealment, passes along the furrow of the lower surface of one of the\r\narms leading to the mouth of the star-fish, which is wide enough, when\r\nthe tentacles are retracted, to leave room for the passage of the\r\nslender body of the _Oxybeles_. This fact likewise proves that the\r\n_Oxybeles_ does not get into the stomach of the _Culcita_ by accident.\r\n\r\n\"If a living _Culcita_ be cut in two, the fish is seen moving freely in\r\nthe cavity of its body. If it be taken out, it immediately seeks the\r\nshade. If the two halves of the _Culcita_ (still alive) be placed in the\r\nwater, the fish will soon be seen to draw towards them, in order to get\r\ninto the cavity of the star-fish. When exposed to the light, it is\r\nuneasy, and its iris contracts excessively. The author never found two\r\nfishes in the same star-fish.\r\n\r\n\"In most of the fishes examined by him, the author found the stomach\r\nempty; it was full only in one. The contents of the stomach had the\r\nappearance of a lump of fat, and consisted of half-digested muscle.\r\nUnder the microscope, striated muscular fibres could be detected, and\r\nthe author thinks that they belonged to the muscles of a fish. This\r\ncircumstance proves that _Oxybeles_ does not feed upon the chyle of the\r\nstar-fish, but that its nourishment is analogous to that of other\r\nfishes. Whether it seizes upon the fishes taken by the star-fish for its\r\nown nourishment must be determined by further investigations.\r\n\r\n\"The author's observations establish--\r\n\r\n\"1. That _Oxybeles gracilis_ is not a true parasite.\r\n\r\n\"2. That it passes the greater part of its life in the stomach of\r\n_Culcita discoidea_, as is also indicated by the unusually pale colour\r\nof the fish.\r\n\r\n\"3. That, however, it can come out, either to seek nourishment, or for\r\nthe purpose of reproduction.\r\n\r\n\"4. That it returns to the mouth along the furrow on the ventral surface\r\nof the arms.\r\n\r\n\"5. That it is very sensitive to light.\r\n\r\n\"6. That it feeds upon other animals.\r\n\r\n\"In fresh water the animals live for about half-an-hour. The pigment\r\nupon the peritoneum exhibits under the microscope the most beautiful\r\nstellate forms. The fish possesses a swimming-bladder.\"[232]\r\n\r\nSome very curious instances of parasitism occur, in which one kind of\r\ncreature compels or induces another creature to labour for its special\r\nbenefit. Indeed, in all cases, the parasite is benefited by the\r\nfunctions of the supporter; but, in the cases I refer to, the slavery is\r\nmore special and more apparent.\r\n\r\nThere is a large species of Crab (_Dromia_) found in the West Indies,\r\nwhich is invariably found covered with a dense mass of sponge. The\r\nsponge is found to have grown in such a manner as to fit every\r\nprominence and cavity of the crab, exactly as if a plastic material had\r\nbeen moulded on it, yet it is not adherent to it, but is merely held in\r\nposition by the hindmost pair of feet, which in this genus of crabs, are\r\nturned upwards, and apparently serve no other purpose than that of hooks\r\nto hold on the sponge _in situ_.\r\n\r\nOn our own shores we are familiar with the Hermit crabs making use of\r\nvarious kinds of univalve shells as houses to protect their softer\r\nhindparts; but in many of these cases there is a third party in the\r\ntransaction, which is made to work for the crab's especial advantage.\r\nThe shell of the mollusk is sometimes covered with a sort of fleshy\r\npolype-mass (_Hydractinia echinata_), which is parasitic on the shell.\r\nThe shell, however, being tenanted also by the active crab, the polype,\r\nas it grows, moulds itself on the crab's body, and thus extends the\r\ndimensions of its house, so that it has no necessity either to enlarge\r\nits dwelling by the absorption of part of the interior shell-wall, or to\r\nleave this shell and search for one of ampler size, as other\r\nHermit-crabs are obliged to do who have not the advantage of so\r\naccommodating a fellow-lodger. \"One can understand,\" says Dr Gray, \"that\r\nthe Crab may have the instinct to search for shells, on which the coral\r\n[polype] has begun to grow; but this will scarcely explain why we never\r\nfind the [polype] except on shells in which Hermit-crabs have taken up\r\ntheir residence.\"[233]\r\n\r\nSmall Annelids and Crustaceans not unfrequently burrow into the stony\r\nwalls of corals; but Dr Gray records a much more uncommon case, from the\r\nGuilding collection. \"It is an expanded coral, which forms a thin\r\nsurface on the top of another coral, and is furnished with a number of\r\nsmall, depressed, horizontal cases, opening with an oblong mouth. Some\r\nof these contain within them a small, free, crustaceous animal, a\r\n_Cymothoa_, which nearly fits the case; and it is evident that, by their\r\nmoving backwards and forwards on the surface, they have caused the\r\nanimal of the coral to form one of these cases for the protection of\r\neach specimen.\"[234]\r\n\r\nThe manner in which this result is obtained is thus explained--\"The\r\nanimals which form their habitation in corals, appear to begin their\r\ndomicile in the same way as the barnacles before referred to; they take\r\nadvantage of the soft and yielding nature of the animals which form the\r\ncorals, &c., and taking up a lodgement in their body, all they have to\r\ndo is to keep a clear passage in it, either by the moving backwards and\r\nforwards, the exertion of their limbs, or the ingress or egress of water\r\nto and from their bodies, and in time, as the coral is secreted by the\r\nanimal, it will form a wall round them; but if, by any accident, the\r\nparasite animal should not keep a passage from the coral to the surface\r\nof the body of the animal clear, which it must be constantly induced to\r\ndo, since by this means it procures food, the coral animal will in a\r\nvery short time close over it and bury it alive in the mass of the\r\ncoral; and this, from the number of these animals, of all sizes and in\r\ndifferent stages of growth, which are to be found in the substance of\r\nthe large and massive corals, must often be occurring. Thus the Italian\r\nromance is often literally fulfilled in nature.\"\r\n\r\nCertain birds are parasitic, in this sense, that they compel or induce\r\nother birds to perform the labour of incubation and of rearing their\r\nyoung. The Rhea or Ostrich of South America is parasitical on its own\r\nspecies; the females laying each several eggs in the nests of several\r\nother females, and the male ostrich taking all the cares of incubation.\r\nMore familiar examples, however, occur in our own Cuckoo, and in the\r\nCowpen birds (_Molothrus_ _pecoris_ and _M. niger_) of North and South\r\nAmerica. \"These fasten themselves,\" as has been remarked by Mr Swainson,\r\n\"on another living animal, whose animal heat brings their young into\r\nlife, whose food they live upon, and whose death would cause theirs\r\nduring the period of infancy.\"\r\n\r\nThe habit, at least in the case of the European Cuckoo, is so well\r\nknown, that I need not do more than merely allude to the fact, that the\r\nfemale seeks for the nests of other insect-eating birds, always much\r\nsmaller than itself, and deposits its own eggs,--a single egg in each;\r\nthat this stranger egg is hatched by the foster-mother with all care,\r\nand the young bird is nurtured with all tenderness even at the expense\r\nof its own proper eggs and young, which in general are sacrificed in the\r\ncourse of the process. Every schoolboy knows these facts, but few\r\nperhaps have ever suspected the existence of a romantic feeling of love\r\nand fealty in the little bird towards the cuckoo herself, prompting the\r\nrendering of the service required as a coveted honour. Yet a naturalist\r\nhas communicated to Mr Yarrell some facts which certainly look this way;\r\nand because they are indubitably the very romance of natural history, I\r\ncite them, leaving my readers to judge of their value.\r\n\r\n\"As you have contributed,\" writes Mr W. C. Newby of Stockton, \"so much\r\nto the information and amusement of the numerous class of readers who\r\ntake an interest in subjects of natural history, I consider it my duty\r\nto communicate first to you, what appears to me a new fact in the\r\nhabits and character of that general favourite the cuckoo.\r\n\r\n\"An egg of this bird was brought to me on the 6th instant, which had\r\nbeen taken from the nest of the yellow bunting, at a short distance from\r\nthis town, and the boy who got the egg gave the following account,\r\nwhich, I think, may be relied on. When bird-nesting the previous\r\nSaturday, he found a nest of the gold spink (a local name for the yellow\r\nbunting) with the young birds just hatched. On visiting the nest the\r\nfollowing day, he flushed the old bird, having seen her sitting on it,\r\nbut the young birds were all excluded, and were lying dead near; and to\r\nhis surprise, a single egg--the one he brought to me--occupied the place\r\nof the callow brood. He took away the egg (which is now in my\r\npossession) so that it is impossible to corroborate the statement in any\r\ndegree. The above circumstance was first named to me by Tom Green, a\r\nwell-known character and naturalist in this town, whom I have always\r\nfound to be accurate in his observations on birds, and by him I was\r\nreferred to the boy. On my objecting to Green that the accident appeared\r\nincredible, because unnatural, and contrary to strong parental instinct,\r\nhe replied, \"Ay, sir, but little birds are mightily ta'en up with a\r\ncuckoo; they'll awmost dee out for them;\" and he related the following\r\nfact which came under his own observation. When out with his gun,\r\ncollecting birds to stuff, (animal-preserving being one of his many\r\ntrades), he shot at and wounded a cuckoo, which, after flying some\r\ndistance, fell upon a hedge with its wings outstretched: the attendant\r\nbird, which in this case was one of the pipits, continued in the flight\r\nof its patron after the shot, and when Green approached, he found it\r\nsitting on the body of the dead cuckoo.[235]\r\n\r\n\"It has been supposed by some, that small birds follow the cuckoo for\r\nthe sake of annoyance, mistaking it for a sparrow-hawk, to give public\r\nnotice of a pirate abroad, and to warn all peaceful subjects of the air\r\nagainst a common danger. But this is clearly not so, for the flight and\r\ncries clearly distinguish the feelings in the two cases. The attendance\r\non the cuckoo is at a distance, silent and respectful; but in the other\r\nwe have a sort of hue and cry raised, as it were, against a felon, and\r\nwhich is kept up from place to place, if not to the shame, at least to\r\nthe discomfiture of the culprit.\r\n\r\n\"The cuckoo is certainly a favourite with them; as Green says, 'they,\r\n(the lesser birds,) are mightily ta'en up with it;' but to what it owes\r\nits influence with its parasites I leave to you and other philosophical\r\nnaturalists to determine: I am content to relate, in simple terms, an\r\ninteresting fact.\"\r\n\r\nThere is so much analogy with these cuckoo-proceedings in the habits of\r\nAnts, that, although these cannot correctly be designated as parasites,\r\nthe details of their manners will not be wholly out of place, in winding\r\nup this chapter. I refer to the propensity manifested by certain species\r\nof ants to make slaves of the workers of another species, leading them\r\ninto captivity and compelling them to labour for the benefit of the\r\nmarauders. Strangely enough, the parallel between the human and the\r\nformican slave-trade holds to this further extent that, so far as we\r\nknow, the kidnappers are red or pale-coloured ants, and the slaves, like\r\ntrue _niggers_, are black.\r\n\r\nThe slave-hunting expeditions are planned and executed with the utmost\r\nskill and courage. \"When the red ants are about to sally forth on a\r\nmarauding expedition, they send scouts to ascertain the exact position\r\nin which a colony of negroes may be found; these scouts, having\r\ndiscovered the object of their search, return to the nest, and report\r\ntheir success. Shortly afterwards the army of red ants marches forth,\r\nheaded by a vanguard which is perpetually changing; the individuals\r\nwhich constitute it, when they have advanced a little before the main\r\nbody, halting, falling into the rear, and being replaced by others: this\r\nvanguard consists of eight or ten ants only.\r\n\r\n\"When they have arrived near the negro colony, they disperse, wandering\r\nthrough the herbage and hunting about, as if aware of the propinquity of\r\nthe object of their search, yet ignorant of its exact position. At last\r\nthey discover the settlement, and the foremost of the invaders rushing\r\nimpetuously to the attack, are met, grappled with, and frequently killed\r\nby the negroes on guard; the alarm is quickly communicated to the\r\ninterior of the nest; the negroes sally forth by thousands, and the red\r\nants rushing to the rescue, a desperate conflict ensues, which, however,\r\nalways terminates in the defeat of the negroes, who retire to the inmost\r\nrecesses of their habitation. Now follows the scene of pillage; the red\r\nants, with their powerful mandibles, tear open the sides of the negro\r\nant-hill, and rush into the heart of the citadel. In a few minutes each\r\nof the invaders emerges, carrying in its mouth the pupa of a worker\r\nnegro, which it has obtained in spite of the vigilance and valour of its\r\nnatural guardians. The red ants return in perfect order to their nest,\r\nbearing with them their living burdens. On reaching the nest the pupæ\r\nappear to be treated precisely as their own, and the workers, when they\r\nemerge, perform the various duties of the community with the greatest\r\nenergy and apparent good will; they repair the nest, excavate passages,\r\ncollect food, feed the larvæ, take the pupæ into the sun-shine, and\r\nperform every office which the welfare of the colony seems to require;\r\nin fact, they conduct themselves entirely as if fulfilling their\r\noriginal destination.\"[236]\r\n\r\n[228] Reinwardt.\r\n\r\n[229] Tennent's _Ceylon_, i. 104.\r\n\r\n[230] \"Affinities of the Stylopites,\" in _Zool._, 1792.\r\n\r\n[231] Wiegmann's _Archiv._, 1860, _Bericht_, p. 169.\r\n\r\n[232] _Ann.

The first of these is that of an officer of high literary\r\nreputation, the Consular representative of Great Britain lately residing\r\nat Boston, in the United States, who thus gives his personal testimony\r\nand that of his lady to the appearance of the monster:--\r\n\r\n\"On a Sunday afternoon in the middle of August, above a hundred persons,\r\nat that time in and about the hotel, were called on to observe an\r\nextraordinary appearance in the sea, at no great distance from the\r\nshore. Large shoals of small fish were rushing landwards in great\r\ncommotion, leaping from the water, crowding on each other, and shewing\r\nall the common symptoms of flight from the pursuit of some wicked enemy.\r\nI had already more than once remarked this appearance from the rocks,\r\nbut in a minor degree; and on these occasions I could always distinguish\r\nthe shark, whose ravages among the \"manhaidens\" was the cause of such\r\nalarm. But the particular case in question was far different from those.\r\nThe pursuer of the fugitive shoals soon became visible; and that it was\r\na huge marine monster, stretching to a length quite beyond the\r\ndimensions of an ordinary fish, was evident to all the observers. No\r\none, in short, had any doubt as to its being the sea-serpent, or one of\r\nthe species to which the animal or animals so frequently before seen\r\nbelonged. The distance at which this one was, for ten minutes or a\r\nquarter of an hour, visible, made it impossible to give a description of\r\nits apparent dimensions so accurate as to carry conviction to the\r\nsceptical. For us who witnessed it, it was enough to be convinced that\r\nthe thing was a reality. But one of the spectators, Dr Amos Binney, a\r\ngentleman of scientific attainments, drew up a minute account of it,\r\nwhich is deposited in the archives of one of the Philosophical Societies\r\nof Boston. I was and am quite satisfied that on this occasion I had a\r\npartial and indistinct but positive view of this celebrated nondescript.\r\nBut had the least doubt rested on my mind, it would have been entirely\r\nremoved by the event of the day following the one just recorded. On that\r\nday, a little before noon, my wife was sitting, as was her wont, reading\r\non the upper piazza of the hotel. She was alone. The gentlemen,\r\nincluding myself and my son, were, as usual, absent at Boston, and the\r\nladies were scattered about in various directions. She was startled by a\r\ncry from the house of \"The sea-serpent! The sea-serpent!\" But this had\r\nbeen so frequent, by the way of joke, since the event of the preceding\r\nday, and was so like \"The wolf, the wolf!\" of the fable, that it did not\r\nattract her particular attention for a moment or two, until she observed\r\ntwo women belonging to the family of the hotel-keeper running along the\r\npiazza towards the corner nearest the sea, with wonder in their eyes,\r\nand the cry of \"The serpent, the serpent! He is turning, he is turning!\"\r\nspontaneously bursting from their lips. Then my wife did fix her looks\r\nin the direction they ran; and sure enough she saw, apparently quite\r\nclose beyond the line formed by the rising ground above the rocks, a\r\nhuge serpent, gliding gracefully through the waves, having evidently\r\nperformed the action of turning round. In an instant it was in a\r\nstraight line, moving rapidly on; and after coasting for a couple of\r\nminutes the north-west front of the hotel, and (as accurately as the\r\nastonished observer could calculate) looking as it stretched at full\r\nlength in the water about the length of the piazza, that is to say,\r\nabout ninety feet; it sank quietly beneath the surface, and was seen no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\"The person who was thus so lucky as to get this unobstructed view, is\r\none so little liable to be led astray by any imaginary impulse, that I\r\nreckon on her statement with entirely as much confidence as if my own\r\neyes had demonstrated its truth.\"--_Grattan's Civilised America_, p. 39.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe second testimony is contained in the following communication with\r\nwhich I have been favoured by Mr Cave:--\r\n\r\n                              35, WILTON PLACE, _April 29, 1861_.\r\n\r\nSIR,--On reading your interesting \"Romance of Natural History\" it\r\noccurred to me that I could supply some corroborative evidence of the\r\nexistence of the sea serpent.
