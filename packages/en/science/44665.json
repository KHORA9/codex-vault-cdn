Some Simple Experiments.= Have you ever shuffled your feet along\r\nover the carpet on a winter's evening and then quickly touched your\r\nfinger to the nose of an unsuspecting friend? Did he jump when a bright\r\nspark leaped from your finger and struck him fairly on the very tip of\r\nhis sensitive nasal organ?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nDid you ever succeed in proving to the pussy-cat, Fig. 1, that\r\nsomething unusual occurs when you thoroughly rub his warm fur with your\r\nhand? Did you notice the bright sparks that passed to your hand when it\r\nwas held just above the cat's back? You should be able to see, hear,\r\nand feel these sparks, especially when the air is dry and you are in a\r\ndark room.\r\n\r\nDid you ever heat a piece of paper before the fire until it was real\r\nhot, then lay it upon the table and rub it from end to end with your\r\nhand, and finally see it cling to the wall?\r\n\r\nWere you ever in a factory where there were large belts running rapidly\r\nover pulleys or wheels, and where large sparks would jump to your hands\r\nwhen held near the belts?\r\n\r\nIf you have never performed any of the four experiments mentioned, you\r\nshould try them the first time a chance occurs. There are dozens of\r\nsimple, fascinating experiments that may be performed with this kind of\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\n=2. Name.= As this variety of electricity is made, or generated, by\r\nthe friction of substances upon each other, it is called _frictional_\r\nelectricity. It is also called _static_ electricity, because it\r\ngenerally stands still upon the surface of bodies and does not \"flow in\r\ncurrents\" as easily as some of the other varieties. Static electricity\r\nmay be produced by induction as well as by friction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\n=3. History.= It has been known for over 2,000 years that certain\r\nsubstances act queerly when rubbed. Amber was the first substance upon\r\nwhich electricity was produced by friction, and as the Greek name for\r\namber is _elektron_, bodies so affected were said to be _electrified_.\r\nWhen a body, like ebonite, is rubbed with a flannel cloth, we say that\r\nit becomes _charged with electricity_. Just what happens to the ebonite\r\nis not clearly understood. We know, however, that it will attract\r\nlight bodies, and then quickly repel them if they be conductors. Fig.\r\n2 shows a piece of tissue-paper jumping toward a sheet of ebonite that\r\nhas been electrified with a flannel cloth.\r\n\r\n=4. Conductors and Non-Conductors.= Electricity can be produced upon\r\nglass and ebonite because they do not carry or conduct it away. If a\r\npiece of iron be rubbed, the electricity passes from the iron into the\r\nearth as fast as it is generated, because the iron is a _conductor_ of\r\nelectricity. Glass is an _insulator_ or _non-conductor_. Frictional\r\nelectricity resides upon the outside, only, of conductors. A hollow\r\ntin box will hold as great a charge as a solid piece of metal having\r\nthe same outside size and shape. When frictional electricity passes\r\nfrom one place to another, sparks are produced. Lightning is caused\r\nby the passage of static electricity from a cloud to the earth, or\r\nfrom one cloud to another. In this case air forms the conductor. (For\r\nexperiments, see \"Study,\" Chapter VII.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\n=5. Electroscopes.= A piece of carbon, pith, or even a small piece of\r\ndamp tissue-paper will serve as an electroscope to test the presence of\r\nstatic electricity. The pith is usually tied to a piece of silk thread\r\nwhich is a non-conductor. Fig. 3 shows the ordinary form of _pith-ball\r\nelectroscope_.\r\n\r\nThe _leaf electroscope_ is a very delicate apparatus. Gold-leaf is\r\ngenerally used, but aluminum-leaf will stand handling and will do for\r\nall ordinary purposes. Fig. 4 shows a common form, the glass being\r\nused to keep currents of air from the leaves and at the same time to\r\ninsulate them from the earth.\r\n\r\nElectroscopes are used to show the presence, relative amount, or kind\r\nof static electricity on a body. (See \"Study,\" Chapter XI.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\n=6. Two Kinds of Electrification.= It can be shown that the\r\nelectrification produced on all bodies by friction is not the same;\r\nfor example, that generated with glass and silk is not the same as\r\nthat made with ebonite and flannel. It has been agreed to call that\r\nproduced by glass and silk _positive_, and that by ebonite and flannel\r\n_negative_. The signs + and - are used for positive and negative.\r\n\r\n=7. Laws of Electrification.= (1) Charges of the same kind repel each\r\nother; (2) charges of unlike kinds attract each other; (3) either kind\r\nof a charge attracts and is attracted by a neutral body.\r\n\r\n=8. Static Electric Machines.= In order to produce static electricity\r\nin quantities for experiments, some device is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe _electrophorus_ (e-lec-troph´-o-rus) is about the simplest form\r\nof machine. Fig. 5 shows a simple electrophorus in which are two\r\ninsulators and one conductor. The ebonite sheet E S is used with a\r\nflannel cloth to generate the electricity. The metal cover E C is\r\nlifted by the insulating handle E R. The cover E C is placed upon the\r\nthoroughly charged sheet E S, and then it is touched for an instant\r\nwith the finger, before lifting it by E R. The charge upon E C can then\r\nbe removed by bringing the hand near it. The bright spark that passes\r\nfrom E C to the hand indicates that E C has discharged itself into the\r\nearth. The action of the electrophorus depends upon induction. (For\r\nexperiments, details of action, induced electrification, etc., see \"The\r\nStudy of Elementary Electricity and Magnetism by Experiment,\" Chapters\r\nVIII. and IX.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.]\r\n\r\n_The first electric machine_ consisted of a ball of sulphur fastened to\r\na spindle which could be turned by a crank. By holding the hands or a\r\npad of silk upon the revolving ball, electricity was produced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.]\r\n\r\n=9. The Cylinder Electric Machine= consists, as shown in Fig. 6, of a\r\nglass cylinder so mounted that it can be turned by a crank. Friction\r\nis produced by a pad of leather C, which presses against the cylinder\r\nas it turns. Electric sparks can be taken from the large \"conductors\"\r\nwhich are insulated from the earth. The opposite electricities unite\r\nwith sparks across D and E. If use is to be made of the electricity,\r\neither the rubber or the prime conductor must be connected with the\r\nground. In the former case positive electricity is obtained; in the\r\nlatter, negative.\r\n\r\n=10. The Plate Electrical Machine.= Fig. 7 also shows an old form of\r\nmachine. Such machines are made of circular plates of glass or ebonite,\r\ntwo rubbing pads being usually employed, one on each side of the plate.\r\nOne operator is seen on an insulated stool (Fig. 7), the electricity\r\npassing through him before entering the earth by way of the body of the\r\nman at the right.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.]\r\n\r\n=11. The Toepler-Holtz Machine=, in one form, is shown in Fig. 8. The\r\nelectricity is produced by the principle of induction, and not by mere\r\nfriction. This machine, used in connection with condensers, produces\r\nlarge sparks.\r\n\r\n=12. The Wimshurst Machine= is of recent date, and not being easily\r\naffected by atmospheric changes, is very useful for ordinary laboratory\r\nwork. Fig. 9 shows one form of this machine.\r\n\r\n=13. Influence Machines for Medical Purposes= are made in a large\r\nvariety of forms. A Wimshurst machine is generally used as an exciter\r\nto charge the plates of the large machine when they lose their charge\r\non account of excessive moisture in the atmosphere. Fig. 10 shows a\r\nlarge machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.]\r\n\r\n=14. Uses of Electrical Machines.= Static electricity has been used for\r\nmany years in the laboratory for experimental purposes, for charging\r\ncondensers, for medical purposes, etc. It is now being used for X-ray\r\nwork, and considerable advancement has been made within a few years in\r\nthe construction and efficiency of the machines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.]\r\n\r\nWith the modern machines large sparks are produced by merely turning\r\na crank, enough electricity being produced to imitate a small\r\nthunderstorm. The sparks of home-made lightning will jump several\r\ninches.\r\n\r\nDo not think that electricity is generated in a commercial way by\r\nstatic electric machines. The practical uses of static electricity are\r\nvery few when compared with those of current electricity from batteries\r\nand dynamos.\r\n\r\n=15. Condensation of Static Electricity.= By means of apparatus called\r\n_condensers_, a terrific charge of static electricity may be stored.\r\nFig. 11 shows the most common form of condenser, known as the _Leyden\r\njar_. It consists of a glass jar with an inside and outside coating of\r\ntin-foil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.]\r\n\r\n_To charge_ the jar it is held in the hand so that the outside coating\r\nshall be connected with the earth, the sparks from an electric machine\r\nbeing passed to the knob at the top, which is connected by a chain to\r\nthe inside coating.\r\n\r\n_To discharge_ the jar, Fig. 12, a conductor with an insulating handle\r\nis placed against the outside coat; when the other end of the conductor\r\nis swung over towards the knob, a bright spark passes between them.\r\nThis device is called a discharger. Fig. 13 shows a discharge through\r\nether which the spark ignites.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.]\r\n\r\n=16. The Leyden Battery=, Fig. 14, consists of several jars connected\r\nin such a way that the area of the inner and outer coatings is greatly\r\nincreased. The battery has a larger capacity than one of its jars. (For\r\nExperiments in Condensation, see \"Study,\" Chapter X.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.]\r\n\r\n=17. Electromotive Force of Static Electricity.= Although the sparks\r\nof static electricity are large, the _quantity_ of electricity is very\r\nsmall. It would take thousands of galvanic cells to produce a spark\r\nan inch long. While the quantity of static electricity is small, its\r\npotential, or electromotive force (E. M. F.), is very high. We say that\r\nan ordinary gravity cell has an E. M. F. of a little over one volt.\r\nFive such cells joined in the proper way would have an E. M. F. of a\r\nlittle over five volts. You will understand, then, what is meant when\r\nwe say that the E. M. F. of a lightning flash is millions of volts.\r\n\r\n=18. Atmospheric Electricity.= The air is usually electrified, even\r\nin clear weather, although its cause is not thoroughly understood. In\r\n1752 it was proved by Benjamin Franklin (Fig. 15), with his famous\r\nkite experiment, that atmospheric and frictional electricities are\r\nof the same nature. By means of a kite, the string being wet by the\r\nrain, he succeeded, during a thunderstorm, in drawing sparks, charging\r\ncondensers, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.]\r\n\r\n=19. Lightning= may be produced by the passage of electricity between\r\nclouds, or between a cloud and the earth (Fig. 16), which, with the\r\nintervening air, have the effect of a condenser. When the attraction\r\nbetween the two electrifications gets great enough, a spark passes.\r\nWhen the spark has a zigzag motion it is called _chain lightning_.\r\nIn hot weather flashes are often seen which light whole clouds, no\r\nthunder being heard. This is called _heat lightning_, and is generally\r\nconsidered to be due to distant discharges, the light of which is\r\nreflected by the clouds. The lightning flash represents billions of\r\nvolts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.]\r\n\r\n=20. Thunder= is caused by the violent disturbances produced in the\r\nair by lightning. Clouds, hills, etc., produce echoes, which, with the\r\noriginal sound, make the rolling effect.\r\n\r\n=21. Lightning-Rods=, when well constructed, often prevent violent\r\ndischarges. Their pointed prongs at the top allow the negative\r\nelectricity of the earth to pass quietly into the air to neutralize\r\nthe positive in the cloud above. In case of a discharge, or stroke of\r\nlightning, the rods aid in conducting the electricity to the earth. The\r\nends of the rods are placed deep in the earth, Fig. 17.\r\n\r\n=22. St. Elmo's Fire.= Electrification from the earth is often drawn up\r\nfrom the earth through the masts of ships, Fig. 18, to neutralize that\r\nin the clouds, and, as it escapes from the points of the masts, light\r\nis produced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.]\r\n\r\n=23. Aurora Borealis=, also called Northern Lights, are luminous\r\neffects, Fig. 19, often seen in the north. They often occur at the\r\nsame time with magnetic storms, when telegraph and telephone work may\r\nbe disturbed. The exact cause of this light is not known, but it is\r\nthought by many to be due to disturbances in the earth's magnetism\r\ncaused by the action of the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT MAGNETS AND MAGNETISM.\r\n\r\n=24. Natural Magnets.= Hundreds of years ago it was discovered that\r\na certain ore of iron, called lodestone, had the power of picking up\r\nsmall pieces of iron. It was used to indicate the north and south\r\nline, and it was discovered later that small pieces of steel could be\r\npermanently magnetized by rubbing them upon the lodestone.\r\n\r\n=25. Artificial Magnets.= Pieces of steel, when magnetized, are called\r\nartificial magnets. They are made in many forms. The electromagnet is\r\nalso an artificial magnet; this will be treated separately.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20]\r\n\r\n=26. The Horseshoe Magnet=, Fig. 20, is, however, the one with which we\r\nare the most familiar. They are always painted red, but the red paint\r\nhas nothing to do with the magnetism.\r\n\r\nThe little end-piece is called the keeper, or armature; it should\r\nalways be kept in place when the magnet is not in use. The magnet\r\nitself is made of steel, while the armature is made of soft iron. Steel\r\nretains magnetism for a long time, while soft iron loses it almost\r\ninstantly. The ends of the magnet are called its _poles_, and nearly\r\nall the strength of the magnet seems to reside at the poles, the curved\r\npart having no attraction for outside bodies. One of the poles of the\r\nmagnet is marked with a line, or with the letter N. This is called the\r\nnorth pole of the magnet, the other being its south pole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.]\r\n\r\n=27. Bar Magnets= are straight magnets. Fig. 21 shows a round bar\r\nmagnet. The screw in the end is for use in the telephone, described\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n=28. Compound Magnets.= When several thin steel magnets are riveted\r\ntogether, a compound magnet is formed. These can be made with\r\nconsiderable strength. Fig. 22 shows a compound horseshoe magnet. Fig.\r\n23 shows a form of compound bar magnet used in telephones. The use of\r\nthe coil of wire will be explained later. A thick piece of steel can\r\nnot be magnetized through and through. In the compound magnet we have\r\nthe effect of a thick magnet practically magnetized through and through.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.]\r\n\r\n=29. Magnetic and Diamagnetic Bodies.= Iron, and substances containing\r\niron, are the ones most readily attracted by a magnet. Iron is said to\r\nbe _magnetic_. Some substances, like nickel, for example, are visibly\r\nattracted by very strong magnets only. Strange as it may seem, some\r\nsubstances are actually repelled by strong magnets; these are called\r\n_diamagnetic_ bodies. Brass, copper, zinc, etc., are not visibly\r\naffected by a magnet. Magnetism will act through paper, glass, copper,\r\nlead, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.]\r\n\r\n=30. Making Magnets.= One of the strangest properties that a magnet\r\nhas is its power to give magnetism to another piece of steel. If\r\na sewing-needle be properly rubbed upon one of the poles of a\r\nmagnet, it will become strongly magnetized and will retain its\r\nmagnetism for years. Strong permanent magnets are made with the aid\r\nof electromagnets. Any number of little magnets may be made from a\r\nhorseshoe magnet without injuring it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.]\r\n\r\n31. Magnetic Needles and Compasses. If a bar magnet be suspended\r\nby a string, or floated upon a cork, which can easily be done with\r\nthe magnet made from a sewing-needle, Fig. 24, it will swing around\r\nuntil its poles point north and south. Such an arrangement is called\r\na _magnetic needle_. In the regular _compass_, a magnetic needle is\r\nsupported upon a pivot. Compasses have been used for many centuries\r\nby mariners and others. Fig. 25 shows an ordinary pocket compass, and\r\nFig. 26 a form of mariner's compass, in which the small bar magnets are\r\nfastened to a card which floats, the whole being so mounted that it\r\nkeeps a horizontal position, even though the vessel rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.]\r\n\r\n32. Action of Magnets Upon Each Other. By making two small\r\nsewing-needle magnets, you can easily study the laws of attraction and\r\nrepulsion. By bringing the two north poles, or the two south poles,\r\nnear each other, a repulsion will be noticed. Unlike poles attract each\r\nother. The attraction between a magnet and iron is mutual; that is,\r\neach attracts the other. Either pole of a magnet attracts soft iron.\r\n\r\nIn magnetizing a needle, either end may be made a north pole at will;\r\nin fact, the poles of a weak magnet can easily be reversed by properly\r\nrubbing it upon a stronger magnet.\r\n\r\n=33. Theory of Magnetism.= Each little particle of a piece of steel or\r\niron is supposed to be a magnet, even before it touches a magnet. When\r\nthese little magnets are thoroughly mixed up in the steel, they pull in\r\nall sorts of directions upon each other and tend to keep the steel from\r\nattracting outside bodies. When a magnet is properly rubbed upon a bar\r\nof steel, the north poles of the little molecular magnets of the steel\r\nare all made to point in the same direction. As the north poles help\r\neach other, the whole bar can attract outside bodies.\r\n\r\nBy jarring a magnet its molecules are thoroughly shaken up; in fact,\r\nmost of the magnetism can be knocked out of a weak magnet by hammering\r\nit.\r\n\r\n=34. Retentivity.= The power that a piece of steel has to hold\r\nmagnetism is called _retentivity_. Different kinds of steel have\r\ndifferent retentivities. A sewing-needle of good steel will retain\r\nmagnetism for years, and it is almost impossible to knock the magnetism\r\nout by hammering it. Soft steel has very little retentivity, because\r\nit does not contain much carbon. Soft iron, which contains less\r\ncarbon than steel, holds magnetism very poorly; so it is not used for\r\npermanent magnets. A little magnetism, however, will remain in the\r\nsoft iron after it is removed from a magnet. This is called _residual\r\nmagnetism_.\r\n\r\n=35. Heat and Magnetism.= Steel will completely lose its magnetism\r\nwhen heated to redness, and a magnet will not attract red-hot iron.\r\nThe molecules of a piece of red-hot iron are in such a state of rapid\r\nvibration that they refuse to be brought into line by the magnet.\r\n\r\n=36. Induced Magnetism.= A piece of soft iron may be induced to become\r\na magnet by holding it near a magnet, absolute contact not being\r\nnecessary. When the soft iron is removed, again, from the influence of\r\nthe magnet, its magnetism nearly all disappears. It is said to have\r\n_temporary_ magnetism; it had _induced_ magnetism. If a piece of soft\r\niron be held near the north pole of a magnet, as in Fig. 27, poles will\r\nbe produced in the soft iron, the one nearest the magnet being the\r\nsouth pole, and the other the north pole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.]\r\n\r\n=37. Magnetic Field.= If a bar magnet be laid upon the table, and a\r\ncompass be moved about it, the compass-needle will be attracted by the\r\nmagnet, and it will point in a different direction for every position\r\ngiven to the compass. This strange power, called magnetism, reaches out\r\non all sides of a magnet. The magnet may be said to act by induction\r\nupon the compass-needle. The space around the magnet, in which this\r\ninductive action takes place, is called the _magnetic field_. Fig. 28\r\nshows some of the positions taken by a compass-needle when moved about\r\non one side of a bar magnet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.]\r\n\r\n=38. Magnetic Figures= can be made by sprinkling iron filings upon a\r\nsheet of paper under which is placed a magnet. Fig. 29 shows a magnetic\r\nfigure made with an ordinary bar magnet. The magnet was placed upon the\r\ntable and over this was laid a piece of smooth paper. Fine iron filings\r\nwere sifted upon the paper, which was gently tapped so that the filings\r\ncould arrange themselves. As each particle of iron became a little\r\nmagnet, by induction, its poles were attracted and repelled by the\r\nmagnet; and when the paper was tapped they swung around to their final\r\npositions. Notice that the filings have arranged themselves in lines.\r\nThese lines show the positions of some of the _lines of magnetic force_\r\nwhich surrounded the magnet.\r\n\r\nThese lines of force pass from the north pole of a magnet through the\r\nair on all sides to its south pole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.]\r\n\r\nFig. 30 shows a magnetic figure made from two bar magnets placed side\r\nby side, their unlike poles being next to each other. Fig. 31 shows\r\nthe magnetic figure of a horseshoe magnet with round poles, the poles\r\nbeing uppermost.\r\n\r\n=39. The Use of Armatures.= A magnet attracts iron most strongly at its\r\npoles, because it is at the poles that the greatest number of lines\r\nof force pass into the air. Lines of force pass easily through soft\r\niron, which is said to be a good conductor of them. Air is not a good\r\nconductor of the lines of force; in order, then, for the lines of force\r\nto pass from the north pole of a magnet to its south pole, they must\r\novercome this resistance of the air, unless the armature is in place. A\r\nmagnet will gradually grow weaker when its armature is left off.\r\n\r\n=40. Terrestrial Magnetism.= As the compass-needle points to the north\r\nand south, the earth must act like a magnet. There is a place very far\r\nnorth, about a thousand miles from the north pole of the earth, which\r\nis called the earth's north magnetic pole. Compass-needles point to\r\nthis place, and not to the earth's real north pole. You can see, then,\r\nthat if a compass be taken north of this magnetic pole, its north pole\r\nwill point south. Lines of force pass from the earth's north magnetic\r\npole through the air on all sides of the earth and enter the earth's\r\nsouth magnetic pole. The compass-needle, in pointing toward the north\r\nmagnetic pole, merely takes the direction of the earth's lines of\r\nforce, just as the particles of iron filings arrange themselves in the\r\nmagnetic figures.\r\n\r\n=41. Declination.= As the magnetic needle does not point exactly to the\r\nnorth, an angle is formed between the true north and south line and the\r\nline of the needle. In Fig. 32 the line marked N S is the true north\r\nand south line. The _angle of variation_, or the declination, is the\r\nangle A between the line N S and the compass-needle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.]\r\n\r\n=42. Dip or Inclination.= If a piece of steel be carefully balanced\r\nupon a support, and then magnetized, it will be found that it will no\r\nlonger balance. The north pole will _dip_ or point downward. Fig. 33\r\nshows what happens to a needle when it is held in different positions\r\nover a bar magnet. It simply takes the directions of the lines of\r\nforce as they pass from the north to the south pole of the magnet.\r\nAs the earth's lines of force pass in curves from the north to the\r\nsouth magnetic pole, you can see why the magnetic needle dips, unless\r\nits south pole is made heavier than its north. Magnetic needles are\r\nbalanced after they are magnetized.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.]\r\n\r\nFig. 34 shows a simple form of dipping needle. These are often used\r\nby geologists and miners. In the hands of the prospector, the\r\nminer's compass, or dipping needle, proves a serviceable guide to the\r\ndiscovery and location of magnetic iron ore. In this instrument the\r\nmagnetic needle is carefully balanced upon a horizontal axis within a\r\ngraduated circle, and in which the needle will be found to assume a\r\nposition inclined to the horizon. This angle of deviation is called the\r\n_inclination_ or _dip_, and varies in different latitudes, and even at\r\ndifferent times in the same place.\r\n\r\n=43. The Earth's Inductive Influence.= The earth's magnetism acts\r\ninductively upon pieces of steel or iron upon its surface. If a piece\r\nof steel or iron, like a stove poker, for example, be held in a north\r\nand south line with its north end dipping considerably, it will be\r\nin the best position for the magnetism of the earth to act upon it;\r\nthat is, it will lie in the direction taken by the earth's lines of\r\nforce. If the poker be struck two or three times with a hammer to\r\nshake up its molecules, we shall find, upon testing it, that it has\r\nbecome magnetized. By this method we can pound magnetism right out of\r\nthe air with a hammer. If the magnetized poker be held level, in an\r\neast and west direction, it will no longer be acted upon to advantage\r\nby the inductive influence of the earth, and we can easily hammer the\r\nmagnetism out of it again. (For experiments on magnets and magnetism\r\nsee \"Study,\" Part I.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nHOW ELECTRICITY IS GENERATED BY THE VOLTAIC CELL.\r\n\r\n\r\n=44. Early Experiments.= In 1786 Galvani, an Italian physician, made\r\nexperiments to study the effect of static electricity upon the nervous\r\nexcitability of animals, and especially upon the frog. He found that\r\nelectric machines were not necessary to produce muscular contractions\r\nor kicks of the frog's legs, and that they could be produced when two\r\ndifferent metals, Fig. 35, like iron and copper, for example, were\r\nplaced in proper contact with a nerve and a muscle and then made to\r\ntouch each other. Galvani first thought that the frog generated the\r\nelectricity instead of the metals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.]\r\n\r\nVolta proved that the electricity was caused by the contact of the\r\nmetals. He used the condensing electroscope as one means of proving\r\nthat two dissimilar metals become charged differently when in contact.\r\nVolta also carried out his belief by constructing what is called a\r\n_Voltaic Pile_. He thought that by making several pairs of metals so\r\narranged that all the little currents would help each other, a strong\r\ncurrent could be generated. Fig. 36 shows a _pile_, it being made by\r\nplacing a pair of zinc and copper discs in contact with one another,\r\nthen laying on the copper disc a piece of flannel soaked in brine, then\r\non top of this another pair, etc., etc. By connecting the first zinc\r\nand the last copper, quite a little current was produced. This was a\r\nstart from which has been built our present knowledge of electricity.\r\nStrictly speaking, electricity is not generated by combinations of\r\nmetals or by cells; they really keep up a difference of potential, as\r\nwill be seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.]\r\n\r\n=45. The Simple Cell.= It has been stated that two different kinds of\r\nelectrifications may be produced by friction; one positive, the other\r\nnegative. Either can be produced, at will, by using proper materials.\r\nFig. 37 shows a section of a _simple cell_; Fig. 38 shows another view.\r\nCu is a piece of copper, and Zn a piece of zinc. When they are placed\r\nin dilute sulphuric acid, it can be shown by delicate apparatus that\r\nthey become charged differently, because the acid acts differently\r\nupon the plates. They become charged by chemical action, and not by\r\nfriction. The zinc is gradually dissolved, and it is this chemical\r\nburning of the zinc that furnishes energy for the electric current in\r\nthe simple cell. The electrification, or charge, on the plates tends to\r\nflow from the place of higher to the place of lower potential, just as\r\nwater tends to flow down hill. If a wire be joined to the two metals, a\r\nconstant current of electricity will flow through it, because the acid\r\ncontinues to act upon the plates. The simple cell is a _single-fluid_\r\ncell, as but one liquid is used in its construction.\r\n\r\n=45a. Plates and Poles.= The metal strips used in voltaic cells are\r\ncalled _plates_ or _elements_. The one most acted upon by the acid\r\nis called the positive (+) plate. In the simple cell the zinc is the\r\n+ plate, and the copper the negative (-) plate. The end of a wire\r\nattached to the - plate is called the + pole, or electrode. Fig. 37\r\nshows the negative (-) electrode as the end of the wire attached to the\r\n+ plate.\r\n\r\n=46. Direction of Current.= In the cell the current passes from the\r\nzinc to the copper; that is, from the positive to the negative plate,\r\nwhere bubbles of hydrogen gas are deposited. In the wire connecting the\r\nplates, the current passes from the copper to the zinc plate. In most\r\ncells, carbon takes the place of copper. (See \"Study,\" § 268.)\r\n\r\n=47. Local Currents; Amalgamation.= Ordinary zinc contains impurities\r\nsuch as carbon, iron, etc., and when the acid comes in contact with\r\nthese, they form with the zinc a small cell. This tends to eat away the\r\nzinc without producing useful currents. The little currents in the cell\r\nfrom this cause are called _local currents_. (See \"Study,\" Exp. 111, §\r\n273.) This is largely overcome by coating the zinc with mercury. This\r\nprocess is called _amalgamation_. It makes the zinc act like pure zinc,\r\nwhich is not acted upon by dilute sulphuric acid when the current does\r\nnot pass. (See \"Study,\" § 257, 274.)\r\n\r\n=48. Polarization of Cells.= Bubbles of hydrogen gas are formed when\r\nzinc is dissolved by an acid. In the ordinary simple cell these bubbles\r\ncollect on the copper plate, and not on the zinc plate, as might be\r\nexpected. The hydrogen is not a conductor of electricity, so this film\r\nof gas holds the current back. The hydrogen acts like a metal and sets\r\nup a current that opposes the zinc to the copper current. Several\r\nmethods are employed to get rid of the hydrogen. (See \"Study,\" § 278,\r\n279, 280.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nVARIOUS VOLTAIC CELLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=49. Single-Fluid and Two-Fluid Cells.= The simple cell (§ 45) is a\r\nsingle-fluid cell. The liquid is called the _electrolyte_, and this\r\nmust act upon one of the plates; that is, chemical action must take\r\nplace in order to produce a current. The simple cell polarizes rapidly,\r\nso something must be used with the dilute sulphuric acid to destroy the\r\nhydrogen bubbles. This is done in the _bichromate of potash cell_.\r\n\r\nIn order to get complete depolarization--that is, to keep the carbon\r\nplate almost perfectly free from hydrogen, it is necessary to use\r\n_two-fluid cells_, or those to which some solid depolarizer is added to\r\nthe one fluid.\r\n\r\n=50. Open and Closed Circuit Cells.= If we consider a voltaic cell, the\r\nwires attached to it, and perhaps some instrument through which the\r\ncurrent passes, we have an _electric circuit_. When the current passes,\r\nthe circuit is _closed_, but when the wire is cut, or in any way\r\ndisconnected so that the current can not pass, the circuit is _open_ or\r\n_broken_. (See \"Study,\" § 266.)\r\n\r\n_Open Circuit Cells_ are those which can give momentary currents at\r\nintervals, such as are needed for bells, telephones, etc. These must\r\nhave plenty of time to rest, as they polarize when the circuit is\r\nclosed for a long time. The _Leclanché_ and _dry_ cells are the most\r\ncommon open circuit cells.\r\n\r\n_Closed Circuit Cells._ For telegraph lines, motors, etc., where a\r\ncurrent is needed for some time, the cell must be of such a nature\r\nthat it will not polarize quickly; it must give a strong and constant\r\ncurrent. The _bichromate_ and _gravity cells_ are examples of this\r\nvariety. (See \"Study,\" § 286.)\r\n\r\n=51. Bichromate of Potash Cells= are very useful for general laboratory\r\nwork. They are especially useful for operating induction coils, small\r\nmotors, small incandescent lamps, for heating platinum wires, etc.\r\nThese cells have an E.M.F. of about 2 volts. Dilute sulphuric acid is\r\nused as the exciting fluid, and in this is dissolved the bichromate of\r\npotash which keeps the hydrogen bubbles from the carbon plate. (See\r\n\"Apparatus Book,\" § 26.) Zinc and carbon are used for the plates, the +\r\npole being the wire attached to the carbon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.]\r\n\r\nFig. 39 shows one form of bichromate cell. It furnishes a large\r\nquantity of current, and as the zinc can be raised from the fluid, it\r\nmay be kept charged ready for use for many months, and can be set in\r\naction any time when required by lowering the zinc into the liquid. Two\r\nof these cells will burn a one candle-power miniature incandescent lamp\r\nseveral hours. The carbon is indestructible.\r\n\r\n    =Note.= For various forms of home-made cells, see \"Apparatus\r\n    Book,\" Chapter I., and for battery fluids see Chapter II.\r\n\r\n=52. The Grenet Cell.= Fig. 40 is another form of bichromate cell. The\r\ncarbon plates are left in the fluid constantly. The zinc plate should\r\nbe raised when the cell is not in use, to keep it from being uselessly\r\ndissolved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.]\r\n\r\n=53. Plunge Batteries.= Two or more cells are often arranged so that\r\ntheir elements can be quickly lowered into the acid solution. Such a\r\ncombination, Fig. 41, is called a _plunge battery_. The binding-posts\r\nare so arranged that currents of different strengths can be taken from\r\nthe combination. The two binding-posts on the right of the battery\r\nwill give the current of one cell; the two binding-posts on the left\r\nof the battery will give the current of two cells, and the two end\r\nbinding-posts will give the current of all three cells. When not in\r\nuse the elements must always be hung on the hooks and kept out of the\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n=54. Large Plunge Batteries=. Fig. 42, are arranged with a winch and\r\na bar above the cells; these afford a ready and convenient means of\r\nlifting or lowering the elements and avoiding waste. In the battery\r\nshown, Fig. 42, the zincs are 4×6 inches; the carbons have the same\r\ndimensions, but there are two carbon plates to each zinc, thus giving\r\ndouble the carbon surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.]\r\n\r\n=55. The Fuller Cell=, Fig. 43, is another type of bichromate cell,\r\nused largely for long-distance telephone service, for telephone\r\nexchange and switch service, for running small motors, etc. It consists\r\nof a glass jar, a carbon plate, with proper connections, a clay porous\r\ncup, containing the zinc, which is made in the form of a cone. A little\r\nmercury is placed in the porous cup to keep the zinc well amalgamated.\r\nEither bichromate of potash or bichromate of soda can be used as a\r\ndepolarizer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.]\r\n\r\n=56. The Gravity Cell=, sometimes called the _bluestone_ or _crowfoot_\r\ncell, is used largely for telegraph, police, and fire-alarm signal\r\nservice, laboratory and experimental work, or whenever a closed circuit\r\ncell is required. The E.M.F. is about one volt. This is a modified form\r\nof the Daniell cell. Fig. 44 shows a home-made gravity cell.\r\n\r\nA copper plate is placed at the bottom of the glass jar, and upon\r\nthis rests a solution of copper sulphate (bluestone). The zinc plate\r\nis supported about four inches above the copper, and is surrounded\r\nby a solution of zinc sulphate which floats upon the top of the blue\r\nsolution. An insulated wire reaches from the copper to the top of the\r\ncell and forms the positive pole. (See \"Apparatus Book,\" § 11 to 15,\r\nfor home-made gravity cell, its regulation, etc. For experiments with\r\ntwo-fluid Daniell cell, see \"Study,\" Exp. 113, § 281 to 286.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.]\r\n\r\n=56a. Bunsen Cells,= Fig. 45, are used for motors, small incandescent\r\nlamps, etc. A carbon rod is inclosed in a porous cup, on the outside of\r\nwhich is a cylinder of zinc that stands in dilute sulphuric acid, the\r\ncarbon being in nitric acid.\r\n\r\n=57. The Leclanché Cell= is an open circuit cell. Sal ammoniac is used\r\nas the exciting fluid, carbon and zinc being used for plates. Manganese\r\ndioxide is used as the depolarizer; this surrounds the carbon plate,\r\nthe two being either packed together in a porous cup or held together\r\nin the form of cakes. The porous cup, or pressed cake, stands in the\r\nexciting fluid. The E. M. F. is about 1.5 volts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.]\r\n\r\nFig. 46 shows a form with porous cup. The binding-post at the top of\r\nthe carbon plate forms the + electrode, the current leaving the cell at\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\n_The Gonda Prism Cell_ (Fig. 47), is a form of Leclanché in which the\r\ndepolarizer is in the form of a cake.\r\n\r\n=58. Dry Cells= are open circuit cells, and can be carried about,\r\nalthough they are moist inside. The + pole is the end of the carbon\r\nplate. Zinc is used as the outside case and + plate. Fig. 48 shows the\r\nordinary forms.\r\n\r\nFig. 49 shows a number of dry cells arranged in a box with switch in\r\nfront, so that the current can be regulated at will.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.]\r\n\r\n=59. The Edison-Lelande Cells=, Fig. 50, are made in several sizes and\r\ntypes. Zinc and copper oxide, which is pressed into plates, form the\r\nelements. The exciting fluid consists of a 25 per cent. solution of\r\ncaustic potash in water. They are designed for both open and closed\r\ncircuit work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nABOUT PUSH-BUTTONS, SWITCHES AND BINDING-POSTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=60. Electrical Connections.= In experimental work, as well as in\r\nthe everyday work of the electrician, electrical connections must\r\nconstantly be made. One wire must be joined to another, just for a\r\nmoment, perhaps, or one piece of apparatus must be put in an electric\r\ncircuit with other apparatus, or the current must be turned on or off\r\nfrom motors, lamps, etc. In order to conveniently and quickly make such\r\nconnections, apparatus called push-buttons, switches and binding-posts\r\nare used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.]\r\n\r\n=61. Push-Buttons.= The simple act of pressing your finger upon a\r\nmovable button, or knob, may ring a bell a mile away, or do some other\r\nequally wonderful thing. Fig. 51 shows a simple push-button, somewhat\r\nlike a simple key in construction. If we cut a wire, through which a\r\ncurrent is passing, then join one of the free ends to the screw A and\r\nthe other end to screw C, we shall be able to let the current pass at\r\nany instant by pressing the spring B firmly upon A.\r\n\r\nPush-buttons are made in all sorts of shapes and sizes. Fig. 52 gives\r\nan idea of the general internal construction. The current enters A by\r\none wire, and leaves by another wire as soon as the button is pushed\r\nand B is forced down to A. The bottom of the little button rests upon\r\nthe top of B.\r\n\r\nFig. 53 shows a _Table Clamp-Push_ for use on dining-tables,\r\ncard-tables, chairs, desks, and other movable furniture. Fig. 54 shows\r\na combination of push-button, speaking-tube, and letter-box used in\r\ncity apartment houses. Fig. 55 shows an _Indicating Push_. The buzzer\r\nindicates, by the sound, whether the call has been heard; that is, the\r\nperson called answers back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.]\r\n\r\n_Modifications_ of ordinary push-buttons are used for floor\r\npush-buttons, on doors, windows, etc., for burglar-alarms, for turning\r\noff or on lights, etc., etc. (See \"Apparatus Book,\" Chapter III., for\r\nhome-made push-buttons.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.]\r\n\r\n=62. Switches= have a movable bar or plug of metal, moving on a pivot,\r\nto make or break a circuit, or transfer a current from one conductor to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nFig. 56 shows a _single point switch_. The current entering the pivoted\r\narm can go no farther when the switch is open, as shown. To close\r\nthe circuit, the arm is pushed over until it presses down upon the\r\ncontact-point. For neatness, both wires are joined to the under side of\r\nthe switch or to binding-posts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.]\r\n\r\nFig. 57 shows a _knife switch_. Copper blades are pressed down between\r\ncopper spring clips to close the circuit. The handle is made of\r\ninsulating material.\r\n\r\n_Pole-changing switches_, Fig. 58, are used for changing or reversing\r\nthe poles of batteries, etc.\r\n\r\nFig. 59 shows a home-made switch, useful in connection with resistance\r\ncoils. By joining the ends of the coils A, B, C, D, with the\r\ncontact-points 1, 2, 3, etc., more or less resistance can be easily\r\nthrown in by simply swinging the lever E around to the left or right.\r\nIf E be turned to 1, the current will be obliged to pass through all\r\nthe coils A, B, etc., before it can pass out at Y. If E be moved to\r\n3, coils A and B will be cut out of the circuit, thus decreasing the\r\nresistance to the current on its way from X to Y. Current regulators\r\nare made upon this principle. (See \"Apparatus Book,\" Chapter IV., for\r\nhome-made switches.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59.]\r\n\r\n_Switchboards_ are made containing from two or three to hundreds of\r\nswitches, and are used in telegraph and telephone work, in electric\r\nlight stations, etc., etc. (See Chapter on Central Stations.) Fig. 60\r\nshows a switch used for incandescent lighting currents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61.]\r\n\r\n=63. Binding-Posts= are used to make connections between two pieces of\r\napparatus, between two or more wires, between a wire and any apparatus,\r\netc., etc. They allow the wires to be quickly fastened or unfastened\r\nto the apparatus. A large part of the apparatus shown in this book has\r\nbinding-posts attached. Fig. 61 shows a few of the common forms used.\r\n(See \"Apparatus Book,\" Chapter V., for home-made binding-posts.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nUNITS AND APPARATUS FOR ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=64. Electrical Units.= In order to measure electricity for\r\nexperimental or commercial purposes, standards or units are just as\r\nnecessary as the inch or foot for measuring distances.\r\n\r\n=65. Potential; Electromotive Force.= If water in a tall tank be\r\nallowed to squirt from two holes, one near the bottom, the other near\r\nthe top, it is evident that the force of the water that comes from the\r\nhole at the bottom will be the greater. The pressure at the bottom is\r\ngreater than that near the top, because the \"head\" is greater.\r\n\r\nWhen a spark of static electricity jumps a long distance, we say that\r\nthe charge has a high _potential_; that is, it has a high electrical\r\npressure. Potential, for electricity, means the same as pressure, for\r\nwater. The greater the potential, or _electromotive force_ (E.M.F.) of\r\na cell, the greater its power to push a current through wires. (See\r\n\"Study,\" § 296 to 305, with experiments.)\r\n\r\n=66. Unit of E.M.F.; the Volt.=--In speaking of water, we say that its\r\npressure is so many pounds to the square inch, or that it has a fall,\r\nor head, of so many feet. We speak of a current as having so many\r\nvolts; for example, we say that a wire is carrying a 110-volt current.\r\nThe volt is the unit of E.M.F. An ordinary gravity cell has an E.M.F.\r\nof about one volt. This name was given in honor of Volta.\r\n\r\n=67. Measurement of Electromotive Force.= There are several ways by\r\nwhich the E.M.F. of a cell, for example, can be measured. It is usually\r\nmeasured _relatively_, by comparison with the E. M. F. of some standard\r\ncell. (See \"Study,\" Exp. 140, for measuring the E. M. F. of a cell by\r\ncomparison with the two-fluid cell.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62.]\r\n\r\n_Voltmeters_ are instruments by means of which E. M. F. can be read on\r\na printed scale. They are a variety of galvanometer, and are made with\r\ncoils of such high resistance, compared with the resistance of a cell\r\nor dynamo, that the E. M. F. can be read direct. The reason for this\r\nwill be seen by referring to Ohm's law (\"Study,\" § 356); the resistance\r\nis so great that the strength of the current depends entirely upon the\r\nE. M. F.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63.]\r\n\r\nVoltmeters measure electrical pressure just as steam gauges measure\r\nthe pressure of steam. Fig. 62 shows one form of voltmeter. Fig. 63\r\nshows a voltmeter with illuminated dial. An electrical bulb behind the\r\ninstrument furnishes light so that the readings can be easily taken.\r\n\r\n=68. Electrical Resistance.= Did you ever ride down hill on a\r\nhand-sled? How easily the sled glides over the snow! What happens,\r\nthough, when you strike a bare place, or a place where some evil-minded\r\nperson has sprinkled ashes? Does the sled pass easily over bare ground\r\nor ashes? Snow offers very little _resistance_ to the sled, while ashes\r\noffer a great resistance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64.]\r\n\r\nAll substances do not allow the electric current to pass through\r\nthem with the same ease. Even the liquid in a cell tends to hold the\r\ncurrent back and offers _internal resistance_. The various wires and\r\ninstruments connected to a cell offer _external resistance_. (See\r\n\"Study,\" Chapter XVIII., for experiments, etc.)\r\n\r\n=69. Unit of Resistance.= =The Ohm= is the name given to the unit of\r\nresistance. About 9 ft. 9 in. of No. 30 copper wire, or 39 feet 1 in.\r\nof No. 24 copper wire, will make a fairly accurate ohm.\r\n\r\n_Resistance coils_, having carefully measured resistances, are made\r\nfor standards. (See \"Apparatus Book,\" Chapter XVII., for home-made\r\nresistance coils.) Fig. 64 shows a commercial form of a standard\r\nresistance coil. The coil is inclosed in a case and has large wires\r\nleading from its ends for connections. Fig. 65 gives an idea of\r\nthe way in which coils are wound and used with plugs to build up\r\n_resistance boxes_, Fig. 66.\r\n\r\n=70. Laws of Resistance.= 1. The resistance of a wire is directly\r\nproportional to its length, provided its cross-section, material, etc.,\r\nare uniform.\r\n\r\n2. The resistance of a wire is inversely proportional to its area of\r\ncross-section; or, in other words, inversely proportional to the square\r\nof its diameter, other things being equal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65.]\r\n\r\n3. The resistance of a wire depends upon its material, as well as upon\r\nits length, size, etc.\r\n\r\n4. The resistance of a wire increases as its temperature rises. (See\r\n\"Study,\" Chapters XVIII. and XIX., for experiments on resistance, its\r\nmeasurement, etc.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66.]\r\n\r\n=71. Current Strength.= The strength of a current at the end of a\r\ncircuit depends not only upon the _electrical pressure_, or E. M. F.,\r\nwhich drives the current, but also upon the _resistance_ which has to\r\nbe overcome. The greater the resistance the weaker the current at the\r\nend of its journey.\r\n\r\n=72. Unit of Current Strength; The Ampere.= A current having an E. M.\r\nF. of _one volt_, pushing its way through a resistance of _one ohm_,\r\nwould have a unit of strength, called _one ampere_. This current, one\r\nampere strong, would deposit, under proper conditions, .0003277 gramme\r\nof copper in _one second_ from a solution of copper sulphate.\r\n\r\n=73. Measurement of Current Strength.= A magnetic needle is deflected\r\nwhen a current passes around it, as in instruments like the\r\ngalvanometer. The _galvanoscope_ merely indicates the presence of a\r\ncurrent. _Galvanometers_ measure the strength of a current, and they\r\nare made in many forms, depending upon the nature and strength of the\r\ncurrents to be measured. Galvanometers are standardized, or calibrated,\r\nby special measurements, or by comparison with some standard\r\ninstrument, so that when the deflection is a certain number of degrees,\r\nthe current passing through it is known to be of a certain strength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67.]\r\n\r\nFig. 67 shows an _astatic galvanometer_. Fig. 68 shows a _tangent\r\ngalvanometer_, in which the strength of the current is proportional\r\nto the tangent of the angle of deflection. Fig. 69 shows a _D'Arsonval\r\ngalvanometer_, in which a coil of wire is suspended between the poles\r\nof a permanent horseshoe magnet. The lines of force are concentrated\r\nby the iron core of the coil. The two thin suspending wires convey the\r\ncurrent to the coil. A ray of light is reflected from the small mirror\r\nand acts as a pointer as in other forms of reflecting galvanometers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68.]\r\n\r\n=74. The Ammeter=, Fig. 70, is a form of galvanometer in which the\r\nstrength of a current, in amperes, can be read. In these the strength\r\nof current is proportional to the angular deflections. The coils are\r\nmade with a small resistance, so that the current will not be greatly\r\nreduced in strength in passing through them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69.]\r\n\r\n=75. Voltameters= measure the strength of a current by chemical means,\r\nthe quantity of metal deposited or gas generated being proportional\r\nto the time that the current flows and to its strength. In the _water\r\nvoltameter_, Fig. 71, the hydrogen and oxygen produced in a given time\r\nare measured. (See \"Study,\" Chapter XXI.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70.]\r\n\r\nThe _copper voltameter_ measures the amount of copper deposited in a\r\ngiven time by the current. Fig. 72 shows one form. The copper cathode\r\nis weighed before and after the current flows. The weight of copper\r\ndeposited and the time taken are used to calculate the current strength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71.]\r\n\r\n=76. Unit of Quantity=; =The Coulomb= is the quantity of electricity\r\ngiven, in _one second_, by a current having a strength of one ampere.\r\nTime is an important element in considering the work a current can do.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 72.]\r\n\r\n=77. Electrical Horse-power=; =The Watt= is the unit of electrical\r\npower. A current having the strength of one ampere, and an E. M.\r\nF. of one volt has a unit of power. 746 watts make one electrical\r\nhorse-power. Watts = amperes × volts. Fig. 73 shows a direct reading\r\nwattmeter based on the international volt and ampere. They save taking\r\nsimultaneous ammeter and voltmeter readings, which are otherwise\r\nnecessary to get the product of volts and amperes, and are also used on\r\nalternating current measurements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73.]\r\n\r\nThere are also forms of wattmeters, Fig. 74, in which the watts are\r\nread from dials like those on an ordinary gas-meter, the records being\r\npermanent.\r\n\r\nFig. 75 shows a voltmeter V, and ammeter A, so placed in the circuit\r\nthat readings can be taken. D represents a dynamo. A is placed so that\r\nthe whole current passes through it, while V is placed between the main\r\nwires to measure the difference in potential. The product of the two\r\nreadings in volts and amperes gives the number of watts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74.]\r\n\r\n=78. Chemical Meters= also measure the quantity of current that is\r\nused; for example, one may be placed in the cellar to measure the\r\nquantity of current used to light the house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75.]\r\n\r\nFig. 76 shows a chemical meter, a part of the current passing through\r\na jar containing zinc plates and a solution of zinc sulphate. Metallic\r\nzinc is dissolved from one plate and deposited upon the other. The\r\nincrease in weight shows the amount of chemical action which is\r\nproportional to the ampere hours. Knowing the relation between the\r\nquantity of current that can pass through the solution to that which\r\ncan pass through the meter by another conductor, a calculation can be\r\nmade which will give the current used. A lamp is so arranged that it\r\nautomatically lights before the meter gets to the freezing-point; this\r\nwarms it up to the proper temperature, at which point the light goes\r\nout again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL EFFECTS OF THE ELECTRIC CURRENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n=79. Electrolysis.= It has been seen that in the voltaic cell\r\nelectricity is generated by chemical action. Sulphuric acid acts upon\r\nzinc and dissolves it in the cell, hydrogen is produced, etc. When\r\nthis process is reversed, that is, when the electric current is passed\r\nthrough some solutions, they are decomposed, or broken up into their\r\nconstituents. This process is called _electrolysis_, and the compound\r\ndecomposed is the _electrolyte_. (See \"Study,\" § 369, etc., with\r\nexperiments.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77.]\r\n\r\nFig. 77 shows how water can be decomposed into its two constituents,\r\nhydrogen and oxygen, there being twice as much hydrogen formed as\r\noxygen.\r\n\r\nFig. 78 shows a glass jar in which are placed two metal strips, A and\r\nC, these being connected with two cells. In this jar may be placed\r\nvarious conducting solutions to be tested. If, for example, we use\r\na solution of copper sulphate, its chemical formula being CuSO_{4},\r\nthe current will break it up into Cu (copper) and SO_{4}. The Cu will\r\nbe deposited upon C as the current passes from A to C through the\r\nsolution. A is called the _anode_, and C the _cathode_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78.]\r\n\r\nFig. 79 shows another form of jar used to study the decomposition of\r\nsolutions by the electric current.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 79.]\r\n\r\n=80. Ions.= When a solution is decomposed into parts by a current, the\r\nparts are called the _Ions_. When copper sulphate (Cu SO_{4}) is used,\r\nthe ions are Cu, which is a metal, and SO_{4}, called an acid radical.\r\nWhen silver nitrate (Ag NO_{3}) is used, Ag and NO_{3} are the ions.\r\nThe metal part of the compound goes to the cathode.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nHOW ELECTROPLATING AND ELECTROTYPING ARE DONE.\r\n\r\n\r\n=81. Electricity and Chemical Action.= We have just seen, Chapter VII.,\r\nthat the electric current has the power to decompose certain compounds\r\nwhen they are in solution. By choosing the right solutions, then, we\r\nshall be able to get copper, silver, and other metals set free by\r\nelectrolysis.\r\n\r\n=82. Electroplating= consists in coating substances with metal with\r\nthe aid of the electric current. If we wish to electroplate a piece\r\nof metal with copper, for example, we can use the arrangement shown\r\nin Fig. 78, in which C is the cathode plate to be covered, and A is\r\na copper plate. The two are in a solution of copper sulphate, and,\r\nas explained in § 79, the solution will be decomposed. Copper will\r\nbe deposited upon C, and the SO_{4} part of the solution will go to\r\nthe anode A, which it will attack and gradually dissolve. The SO_{4},\r\nacting upon the copper anode, makes CuSO_{4} again, and this keeps the\r\nsolution at a uniform strength. The amount of copper dissolved from the\r\ncopper anode equals, nearly, the amount deposited upon the cathode. The\r\nmetal is carried in the direction of the current.\r\n\r\nIf we wish to plate something with silver or gold, it will be necessary\r\nto use a solution of silver or gold for the electrolyte, a plate of\r\nmetallic silver or gold being used for the anode, as the case may be.\r\n\r\nGreat care is used in cleaning substances to be plated, all dirt and\r\ngrease being carefully removed.\r\n\r\nFig. 80 shows a plating bath in which several articles can be plated\r\nat the same time by hanging them upon a metal bar which really forms a\r\npart of the cathode. If, for example, we wish to plate knives, spoons,\r\netc., with silver, they would be hung from the bar shown, each being a\r\npart of the cathode. The vat would contain a solution of silver, and\r\nfrom the other bar would be hung a silver plate having a surface about\r\nequal to that of the combined knives, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80.]\r\n\r\nMost metals are coated with copper before they are plated with silver\r\nor gold. When plating is done on a large scale, a current from a dynamo\r\nis used. For experimental purposes a Gravity cell will do very well.\r\n(See \"Study,\" § 374 to 380 with experiments.)\r\n\r\n=83. Electrotyping.= It was observed by De La Rue in 1836 that in the\r\nDaniell cell an even coating of copper was deposited upon the copper\r\nplate. From this was developed the process of electrotyping, which\r\nconsists in making a copy in metal of a wood-cut, page of type, etc.\r\nA mould or impression of the type or coin is first made in wax, or\r\nother suitable material. These moulds are, of course, the reverse\r\nof the original, and as they do not conduct electricity, have to be\r\ncoated with graphite. This thin coating lines the mould with conducting\r\nmaterial so that the current can get to every part of the mould.\r\nThese are then hung upon the cathode in a bath of copper sulphate\r\nas described in § 82. The electric current which passes through the\r\nvat deposits a thin layer of metallic copper next to the graphite.\r\nWhen this copper gets thick enough, the wax is melted away from it,\r\nleaving a thin shell of copper, the side next to the graphite being\r\nexactly alike in shape to the type, but made of copper. These thin\r\ncopper sheets are too thin to stand the pressure necessary on printing\r\npresses, so they are strengthened by backing them with soft metal which\r\nfills every crevice, making solid plates about ¼ in. thick. These\r\nplates or _electrotypes_ are used to print from, the original type\r\nbeing used to set up another page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE STORAGE BATTERY, AND HOW IT WORKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=84. Polarization.= It has been stated that a simple cell polarizes\r\nrapidly on account of hydrogen bubbles that form upon the copper plate.\r\nThey tend to send a current in the opposite direction to that of the\r\nmain current, which is thereby weakened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 81.]\r\n\r\n=85. Electromotive Force of Polarization.= It has been shown, Fig. 71,\r\nthat water can be decomposed by the electric current. Hydrogen and\r\noxygen have a strong attraction or chemical affinity for each other, or\r\nthey would not unite to form water. This attraction has to be overcome\r\nbefore the water can be decomposed. As soon as the decomposing current\r\nceases to flow, the gases formed try to rush together again; in fact,\r\nif the water voltameter be disconnected from the cells and connected\r\nwith a galvanoscope, the presence of a current will be shown. This\r\nvoltameter will give a current with an E. M. F. of nearly 1.5 volts; so\r\nit is evident that we must have a current with a higher voltage than\r\nthis to decompose water. This E. M. F., due to polarization, is called\r\nthe E. M. F. of polarization.\r\n\r\n=86. Secondary or Storage Batteries=, also called _accumulators_, do\r\nnot really store electricity. They must be charged by a current before\r\nthey can give out any electricity. Chemical changes are produced in the\r\nstorage cells by the charging current just as they are in voltameters,\r\nelectroplating solutions, etc.; so it is potential chemical energy\r\nthat is really stored. When the new products are allowed to go back to\r\ntheir original state, by joining the electrodes of the charged cell, a\r\ncurrent is produced.\r\n\r\nFig. 81 shows two lead plates, A and B, immersed in dilute sulphuric\r\nacid, and connected with two ordinary cells. A strong current will pass\r\nthrough the liquid between A and B at first, but it will quickly become\r\nweaker, as chemical changes take place in the liquid. This may be shown\r\nby a galvanometer put in the circuit before beginning the experiment.\r\nBy disconnecting the wires from the cells and joining them to the\r\ngalvanometer, it will be shown that a current comes from the lead\r\nplates. This arrangement may be called a simple storage cell. Regular\r\nstorage cells are charged with the current from a dynamo. (See \"Study,\"\r\nExp. 151.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 82.]\r\n\r\nThe first storage cells were made of plain lead plates, rolled up in\r\nsuch a way that they were close to each other, but did not touch. These\r\nwere placed in dilute sulphuric acid. They were charged in alternate\r\ndirections several times, until the lead became properly acted upon, at\r\nwhich time the cell would furnish a current.\r\n\r\nA great improvement was made in 1881, by Faure, who coated the plates\r\nwith red lead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 83.]\r\n\r\nThe method now generally practiced is to cast a frame of lead, with\r\nraised right-angled ribs on each side, thus forming little depressed\r\nsquares, or to punch a lead plate full of holes, which squares or holes\r\nare then filled with a pasty mixture of red oxide of lead in positive\r\nplates, and with litharge in negatives. In a form called the chloride\r\nbattery, instead of cementing lead oxide paste into or against a lead\r\nframing in order to obtain the necessary active material, the latter is\r\nobtained by a strictly chemical process.\r\n\r\nFig. 82 shows a storage cell with plates, etc., contained in a glass\r\njar. Fig. 83 shows a cell of 41 plates, set up in a lead-lined wood\r\ntank. Fig. 84 shows three cells joined in series. Many storage cells\r\nare used in central electric light stations to help the dynamos during\r\nthe \"rush\" hours at night. They are charged during the day when the\r\nload on the dynamos is not heavy.\r\n\r\nFig. 85 shows another form of storage cell containing a number of\r\nplates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 84.]\r\n\r\n=87. The Uses of Storage Batteries= are almost numberless. The current\r\ncan be used for nearly everything for which a constant current is\r\nadapted, the following being some of its applications: Carriage\r\npropulsion; electric launch propulsion; train lighting; yacht lighting;\r\ncarriage lighting; bicycle lighting; miners' lamps; dental, medical,\r\nsurgical, and laboratory work; phonographs; kinetoscopes; automaton\r\npianos; sewing-machine motors; fan motors; telegraph; telephone;\r\nelectric bell; electric fire-alarm; heat regulating; railroad switch\r\nand signal apparatus.\r\n\r\nBy the installing of a storage plant many natural but small sources\r\nof power may be utilized in furnishing light and power; sources which\r\notherwise are not available, because not large enough to supply maximum\r\ndemands. The force of the tides, of small water powers from irrigating\r\nditches, and even of the wind, come under this heading.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 85.]\r\n\r\nAs a regulator of pressure, in case of fluctuations in the load, the\r\nvalue of a storage plant is inestimable. These fluctuations of load are\r\nparticularly noticeable in electric railway plants, where the demand is\r\nconstantly rising and falling, sometimes jumping from almost nothing to\r\nthe maximum, and _vice versa_, in a few seconds. If for no other reason\r\nthan the prevention of severe strain on the engines and generators,\r\ncaused by these fluctuations of demand, a storage plant will be\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nHOW ELECTRICITY IS GENERATED BY HEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\n=88. Thermoelectricity= is the name given to electricity that is\r\ngenerated by heat. If a strip of iron, I, be connected between two\r\nstrips of copper, C C, these being joined by a copper wire, C W, we\r\nshall have an arrangement that will generate a current when heated at\r\neither of the junctions between C and I. When it is heated at A the\r\ncurrent will flow as shown by arrows, from C to I. If we heat at B,\r\nthe current will flow in the opposite direction through the metals,\r\nalthough it will still go from C to I as before. Such currents are\r\ncalled _thermoelectric currents_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 86.]\r\n\r\nDifferent pairs of metals produce different results. Antimony and\r\nbismuth are generally used, because the greatest effect is produced\r\nby them. If the end of a strip of bismuth be soldered to the end of\r\na similar strip of antimony, and the free ends be connected to a\r\ngalvanometer of low resistance, the presence of a current will be shown\r\nwhen the point of contact becomes hotter than the rest of the circuit.\r\nThe current will flow from bismuth to antimony across the joint. By\r\ncooling the juncture below the temperature of the rest of the circuit,\r\na current will be produced in the opposite direction to the above. The\r\nenergy of the current is kept up by the heat absorbed, just as it is\r\nkept up by chemical action in the voltaic cell.\r\n\r\n=89. Peltier Effect.= If an electric current be passed through pairs of\r\nmetals, the parts at the junction become slightly warmer or cooler than\r\nbefore, depending upon the direction of the current. This action is\r\nreally the reverse of that in which currents are produced by heat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 87.]\r\n\r\n=90. Thermopiles.= As the E.M.F. of the current produced by a single\r\npair of metals is very small, several pairs are usually joined in\r\nseries, so that the different currents will help each other by flowing\r\nin the same direction. Such combinations are called thermoelectric\r\npiles, or simply _thermopiles_.\r\n\r\nFig. 87 shows such an arrangement, in which a large number of elements\r\nare placed in a small space. The junctures are so arranged that the\r\nalternate ones come together at one side.\r\n\r\nFig. 88 shows a thermopile connected with a galvanometer. The heat of\r\na match, or the cold of a piece of ice, will produce a current, even if\r\nheld at some distance from the thermopile. The galvanometer should be\r\na short-coil astatic one. (See \"Study,\" Chapter XXIV., for experiments\r\nand home-made thermopile.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 88.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nMAGNETIC EFFECTS OF THE ELECTRIC CURRENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n=91. Electromagnetism= is the name given to magnetism that is developed\r\nby electricity. We have seen that if a magnetic needle be placed in the\r\nfield of a magnet, its N pole will point in the direction taken by the\r\nlines of force as they pass from the N to the S pole of the magnet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 89.]\r\n\r\n=92. Lines of Force about a Wire.= When a current passes through a\r\nwire, the magnetic needle placed over or under it tends to take a\r\nposition at right angles to the wire. Fig. 89 shows such a wire and\r\nneedle, and how the needle is deflected; it twists right around from\r\nits N and S position as soon as the current begins to flow. This shows\r\nthat the lines of force pass _around_ the wire and not in the direction\r\nof its length. The needle does not swing entirely perpendicular to the\r\nwire, that is, to the E and W line, because the earth is at the same\r\ntime pulling its N pole toward the N.\r\n\r\nFig. 90 shows a bent wire through which a current passes from C to Z.\r\nIf you look along the wire from C toward the points A and B, you will\r\nsee that _under_ the wire the lines of force pass to the left. Looking\r\nalong the wire from Z toward D you will see that the lines of force\r\npass opposite to the above, as the current comes _toward_ you. This is\r\nlearned by experiment. (See \"Study,\" Exp. 152, § 385, etc.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 90.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 91.]\r\n\r\n_Rule._ Hold the right hand with the thumb extended (Fig. 89) and with\r\nthe fingers pointing in the direction of the current, the palm being\r\ntoward the needle and on the opposite side of the wire from the needle.\r\nThe north-seeking pole will then be deflected in the direction in which\r\nthe thumb points.\r\n\r\n=93. Current Detectors.= As there is a magnetic field about a wire when\r\na current passes through it, and as the magnetic needle is affected, we\r\nhave a means of detecting the presence of a current. When the current\r\nis strong it is simply necessary to let it pass once over or under a\r\nneedle; when it is weak, the wire must pass several times above and\r\nbelow the needle, Fig. 91, to give the needle motion. (See \"Apparatus\r\nBook,\" Chapter XIII., for home-made detectors.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 92.]\r\n\r\n=94. Astatic Needles and Detectors.= By arranging two magnetized\r\nneedles with their poles opposite each other, Fig. 92, an _astatic\r\nneedle_ is formed. The pointing-power is almost nothing, although\r\ntheir magnetic fields are retained. This combination is used to detect\r\nfeeble currents. In the ordinary detector, the tendency of the needle\r\nto point to the N and S has to be overcome by the magnetic field about\r\nthe coil before the needle can be moved; but in the _astatic detector_\r\nand _galvanoscope_ this pointing-power is done away with. Fig. 93 shows\r\na simple _astatic galvanoscope_. Fig. 67 shows an astatic galvanometer\r\nfor measuring weak currents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 93.]\r\n\r\n=95. Polarity of Coils.= When a current of electricity passes through\r\na coil of wire, the coil acts very much like a magnet, although no\r\niron enters into its construction. The coil becomes magnetized by the\r\nelectric current, lines of force pass from it into the air, etc. Fig.\r\n94 shows a coil connected to copper and zinc plates, so arranged with\r\ncork that the whole can float in a dish of dilute sulphuric acid. The\r\ncurrent passes as shown by the arrows, and when the N pole of a magnet\r\nis brought near the right-hand end, there is a repulsion, showing that\r\nthat end of the coil has a N pole.\r\n\r\n_Rule._ When you face the right-hand end of the coil, the current is\r\nseen to pass around it in an anti-clockwise direction; this produces a\r\nN pole. When the current passes in a clockwise direction a S pole is\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 94.]\r\n\r\n=96. Electromagnets.= A coil of wire has a stronger field than a\r\nstraight wire carrying the same current, because each turn adds its\r\nfield to the fields of the other turns. By having the central part of\r\nthe coil made of iron, or by having the coil of insulated wire wound\r\nupon an iron _core_, the strength of the magnetic field of the coil is\r\ngreatly increased.\r\n\r\nLines of force do not pass as readily through air as through iron;\r\nin fact, lines of force will go out of their way to go through iron.\r\nWith a coil of wire the lines of force pass from its N pole through\r\nthe air on all sides of the coil to its S pole; they then pass through\r\nthe inside of the coil and through the air back to the N pole. When\r\nthe resistance to their passage through the coil is decreased by the\r\ncore, the magnetic field is greatly strengthened, and we have an\r\n_electromagnet_.\r\n\r\nThe coil of wire temporarily magnetizes the iron core; it can\r\npermanently magnetize a piece of steel used as a core. (See \"Study,\"\r\nChapter XXII., for experiments.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 95.]\r\n\r\n=97. Forms of Electromagnets.= Fig. 95 shows a _straight, or\r\nbar electromagnet_. Fig. 96 shows a simple form of _horseshoe\r\nelectromagnet_. As this form is not easily wound, the coils are\r\ngenerally wound on two separate cores which are then joined by a\r\n_yoke_. The yoke merely takes the place of the curved part shown\r\nin Fig. 96. In Fig. 97 is shown the ordinary form of horseshoe\r\nelectromagnet used for all sorts of electrical instruments. (See\r\n\"Apparatus Book,\" Chapter IX., for home-made electromagnets.)\r\n\r\n=98. Yokes and Armatures.= In the horseshoe magnet there are two poles\r\nto attract and two to induce. The lines of force pass through the yoke\r\non their way from one core to the other, instead of going through\r\nthe air. This reduces the resistance to them. If we had no yoke we\r\nshould simply have two straight electromagnets, and the resistance to\r\nthe lines of force would be so great that the total strength would\r\nbe much reduced. Yokes are made of soft iron, as well as the cores\r\nand armature. The _armature_, as with permanent horseshoe magnets, is\r\nstrongly drawn toward the poles. As soon as the current ceases to flow,\r\nthe attraction also ceases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 96.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 97.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 98.]\r\n\r\nBeautiful magnetic figures can be made with horseshoe magnets. Fig. 98\r\nshows that the coils must be joined so that the current can pass around\r\nthe cores in opposite directions to make unlike poles. (See \"Study,\"\r\nExp. 164 to 173.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nHOW ELECTRICITY IS GENERATED BY INDUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n=99. Electromagnetic Induction.= We have seen that a magnet has the\r\npower to act through space and induce another piece of iron or steel\r\nto become a magnet. A charge of static electricity can induce a\r\ncharge upon another conductor. We have now to see how a _current_ of\r\nelectricity in one conductor can induce a current in another conductor,\r\nnot in any way connected with the first, and how a magnet and a coil\r\ncan generate a current.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 99.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 100.]\r\n\r\n=100. Current from Magnet and Coil.= If a bar magnet, Fig. 99, be\r\nsuddenly thrust into a hollow coil of wire, a momentary current of\r\nelectricity will be generated in the coil. No current passes when the\r\nmagnet and coil are still; at least one of them must be in motion. Such\r\na current is said to be _induced_, and is an _inverse_ one when the\r\nmagnet is inserted, and a _direct_ one when the magnet is withdrawn\r\nfrom the coil.\r\n\r\n=101. Induced Currents and Lines of Force.= Permanent magnets are\r\nconstantly sending out thousands of lines of force. Fig. 100 shows\r\na bar magnet entering a coil of wire; the number of lines of force\r\nis increasing, and the induced current passes in an anti-clockwise\r\ndirection when looking down into the coil along the lines of force.\r\nThis produces an indirect current. If an iron core be used in the coil,\r\nthe induced current will be greatly strengthened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 101.]\r\n\r\nIt takes force to move a magnet through the center of a coil, and it\r\nis this work that is the source of the induced current. We have, in\r\nthis simple experiment, the key to the action of the dynamo and other\r\nelectrical machines.\r\n\r\n=102. Current from two Coils.= Fig. 101 shows two coils of wire, the\r\nsmaller being connected to a cell, the larger to a galvanometer.\r\nBy moving the small coil up and down inside of the large one,\r\ninduced currents are generated, first in one direction and then in\r\nthe opposite. We have here two entirely separate circuits, in no\r\nway connected. The _primary_ current comes from the cell, while the\r\n_secondary_ current is an induced one. By placing a core in the small\r\ncoil of Fig. 101, the induced current will be greatly strengthened.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to have the two coils so that one or both of them\r\ncan move. They may be wound on the same core, or otherwise arranged as\r\nin the induction coil. (See \"Study,\" Chapter XXV., for experiments on\r\ninduced currents.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nHOW THE INDUCTION COIL WORKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=103. The Coils.= We saw, § 102, that an induced current was generated\r\nwhen a current-carrying coil, Fig. 101, was thrust into another coil\r\nconnected with a galvanometer. The galvanometer was used merely to show\r\nthe presence of the current. The _primary coil_ is the one connected\r\nwith the cell; the other one is called the _secondary coil_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 102.]\r\n\r\nWhen a current suddenly begins to flow through a coil, the effect upon\r\na neighboring coil is the same as that produced by suddenly bringing\r\na magnet near it; and when the current stops, the opposite effect is\r\nproduced. It is evident, then, that we can keep the small coil of\r\nFig. 101 with its core inside of the large coil, and generate induced\r\ncurrents by merely making and breaking the primary circuit.\r\n\r\nWe may consider that when the primary circuit is closed, the lines of\r\nforce shoot out through the turns of the secondary coil just as they\r\ndo when a magnet or a current-carrying coil is thrust into it. Upon\r\nopening the circuit, the lines of force cease to exist; that is, we may\r\nimagine them drawn in again.\r\n\r\n=104. Construction.= Fig. 102 shows one form of home-made induction\r\ncoil, given here merely to explain the action and connections. Nearly\r\nall induction coils have some form of automatic current interrupter,\r\nplaced in the primary circuit, to rapidly turn the current off and on.\r\n\r\n_Details of Figs. 102 and 103._ Wires 5 and 6 are the ends of the\r\nprimary coil, while wires 7 and 8 are the terminals of the secondary\r\ncoil. The primary coil is wound on a bolt which serves as the core, and\r\non this coil is wound the secondary which consists of many turns of\r\nfine wire. The wires from a battery should be joined to binding-posts W\r\nand X, and the handles, from which the shock is felt, to Y and Z. Fig.\r\n103 shows the details of the interrupter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 103.]\r\n\r\nIf the current from a cell enters at W, it will pass through the\r\nprimary coil and out at X, after going through 5, R, F, S I, B, E and\r\nC. The instant the current passes, the bolt becomes magnetized; this\r\nattracts A, which pulls B away from the end of S I, thus automatically\r\nopening the circuit. B at once springs back to its former position\r\nagainst SI, as A is no longer attracted; the circuit being closed, the\r\noperation is rapidly repeated.\r\n\r\nA _condenser_ is usually connected to commercial forms. It is placed\r\nunder the wood-work and decreases sparking at the interrupter. (See\r\n\"Apparatus Book,\" Chapter XI., for home-made induction coils.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 104.]\r\n\r\nFig. 104 shows one form of coil. The battery wires are joined to the\r\nbinding-posts at the left. The secondary coil ends in two rods, and the\r\nspark jumps from one to the other. The interrupter and a switch are\r\nshown at the left.\r\n\r\nFig. 105 shows a small coil for medical purposes. A dry cell is placed\r\nunder the coil and all is included in a neat box. The handles form the\r\nterminals of the secondary coil.\r\n\r\n=105. The Currents.= It should be noted that the current from the\r\ncell does not get into the secondary coil. The coils are thoroughly\r\ninsulated from each other. The secondary current is an induced one,\r\nits voltage depending upon the relative number of turns of wire there\r\nare in the two coils. (See Transformers.) The secondary current is\r\nan alternating one; that is, it flows in one direction for an instant\r\nand then immediately reverses its direction. The rapidity of the\r\nalternations depends upon the speed of the interrupter. Coils are made\r\nthat give a secondary current with an enormous voltage; so high, in\r\nfact, that the spark will pass many inches, and otherwise act like\r\nthose produced by static electric machines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 105.]\r\n\r\n=106. Uses of Induction Coils.= Gas-jets can be lighted at a distance\r\nwith the spark from a coil, by extending wires from the secondary\r\ncoil to the jet. Powder can be fired at a distance, and other things\r\nperformed, when a high voltage current is needed. Its use in medicine\r\nhas been noted. It is largely used in telephone work. Of late, great\r\nuse has been made of the secondary current in experiments with\r\nvacuum-tubes, X-ray work, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH, AND HOW IT SENDS MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\n=107. The Complete Telegraph Line= consists of several instruments,\r\nswitches, etc., etc., but its essential parts are: The _Line_, or wire,\r\nwhich connects the different stations; the _Transmitter_ or _Key_; the\r\n_Receiver_ or _Sounder_, and the _Battery_ or _Dynamo_.\r\n\r\n=108. The Line= is made of strong copper, iron, or soft steel wire. To\r\nkeep the current in the line it is insulated, generally upon poles, by\r\nglass insulators. For very short lines two wires can be used, the line\r\nwire and the return; but for long lines the earth is used as a return,\r\na wire from each end being joined to large metal plates sunk in the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 106.]\r\n\r\n=109. Telegraph Keys= are merely instruments by which the circuit\r\ncan be conveniently and rapidly opened or closed at the will of the\r\noperator. An ordinary push-button may be used to turn the current off\r\nand on, but it is not so convenient as a key.\r\n\r\nFig. 106 shows a side view of a simple key which can be put anywhere\r\nin the circuit, one end of the cut wire being attached to X and the\r\nother to Y. By moving the lever C up and down according to a previously\r\narranged set of signals, a current will be allowed to pass to a\r\ndistant station. As X and Y are insulated from each other, the current\r\ncan pass only when C presses against Y.\r\n\r\nFig. 107 shows a regular key, with switch, which is used to allow the\r\ncurrent to pass through the instrument when receiving a message.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 107.]\r\n\r\n=110. Telegraph Sounders= receive the current from some distant\r\nstation, and with its electromagnet produce sounds that can be\r\ntranslated into messages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 108.]\r\n\r\nFig. 108 shows simply an electromagnet H, the coil being connected in\r\nseries with a key K and a cell D C. The key and D C are shown by a top\r\nview. The lever of K does not touch the other metal strap until it is\r\npressed down. A little above the core of H is held a strip of iron, on\r\narmature I. As soon as the circuit is closed at K, the current rushes\r\nthrough the circuit, and the core attracts I making a distinct _click_.\r\nAs soon as K is raised, I springs away from the core, if it has been\r\nproperly held. In regular instruments a click is also made when the\r\narmature springs back again.\r\n\r\nThe time between the two clicks can be short or long, to represent\r\n_dots_ or _dashes_, which, together with _spaces_, represent letters.\r\n(For Telegraph Alphabet and complete directions for home-made keys,\r\nsounders, etc., see \"Apparatus Book,\" Chapter XIV.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 109.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 110.]\r\n\r\nFig. 109 shows a form of home-made sounder. Fig. 110 shows one form of\r\ntelegraph sounder. Over the poles of the horseshoe electromagnet is an\r\narmature fixed to a metal bar that can rock up and down. The instant\r\nthe current passes through the coils the armature comes down until a\r\nstop-screw strikes firmly upon the metal frame, making the down click.\r\nAs soon as the distant key is raised, the armature is firmly pulled\r\nback and another click is made. The two clicks differ in sound, and can\r\nbe readily recognized by the operator.\r\n\r\n=111. Connections for Simple Line.= Fig. 111 shows complete connections\r\nfor a home-made telegraph line. The capital letters are used for the\r\nright side, R, and small letters for the left side, L. Gravity cells,\r\nB and b, are used. The _sounders_, S and s, and the _keys_, K and k,\r\nare shown by a top view. The broad black lines of S and s represent the\r\narmatures which are directly over the electromagnets. The keys have\r\nswitches, E and e.\r\n\r\nThe two stations, R and L, may be in the same room, or in different\r\nhouses. The _return wire_, R W, passes from the copper of b to the zinc\r\nof B. This is important, as the cells must help each other; that is,\r\nthey are in series. The _line wire_, L W, passes from one station to\r\nthe other, and the return may be through the wire, R W, or through the\r\nearth; but for short lines a wire is best.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 111.]\r\n\r\n=112. Operation of Simple Line.= Suppose two boys, R (right) and L\r\n(left) have a line. Fig. 111 shows that R's switch, E, is open, while\r\ne is closed. The entire circuit, then, is broken at but one point. As\r\nsoon as R presses his key, the circuit is closed, and the current from\r\nboth cells rushes around from B, through K, S, L W, s, k, b, R W, and\r\nback to B. This makes the armatures of S and s come down with a click\r\nat the same time. As soon as the key is raised, the armatures lift and\r\nmake the up-click. As soon as R has finished, he closes his switch E.\r\nAs the armatures are then held down, L knows that R has finished, so\r\nhe opens his switch e, and answers R. Both E and e are closed when the\r\nline is not in use, so that either can open his switch at any time and\r\ncall up the other. Closed circuit cells must be used for such lines. On\r\nvery large lines dynamos are used to furnish the current.\r\n\r\n=113. The Relay.= Owing to the large resistance of long telegraph\r\nlines, the current is weak when it reaches a distant station, and not\r\nstrong enough to work an ordinary sounder. To get around this, relays\r\nare used; these are very delicate instruments that replace the sounder\r\nin the line wire circuit. Their coils are usually wound with many turns\r\nof fine wire, so that a feeble current will move its nicely adjusted\r\narmature. The relay armature merely acts as an automatic key to open\r\nand close a local circuit which includes a battery and sounder. The\r\nline current does not enter the sounder; it passes back from the relay\r\nto the sending station through the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 112.]\r\n\r\nFig. 112 gives an idea of simple relay connections. The key K, and\r\ncell D C, represent a distant sending station. E is the electromagnet\r\nof the relay, and R A is its armature. L W and R W represent the line\r\nand return wires. R A will vibrate toward E every time K is pressed,\r\nand close the local circuit, which includes a local battery, L B, and\r\na sounder. It is evident that as soon as K is pressed the sounder will\r\nwork with a good strong click, as the local battery can be made as\r\nstrong as desired.\r\n\r\nFig. 113 shows a regular instrument which opens and closes the local\r\ncircuit at the top of the armature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 113.]\r\n\r\n=114. Ink Writing Registers= are frequently used instead of sounders.\r\nFig. 114 shows a writing register that starts itself promptly at the\r\nopening of the circuit, and stops automatically as soon as the circuit\r\nreturns to its normal condition. A strip of narrow paper is slowly\r\npulled from the reel by the machine, a mark being made upon it every\r\ntime the armature of an inclosed electromagnet is attracted. When the\r\ncircuit is simply closed for an instant, a short line, representing a\r\n_dot_, is made.\r\n\r\nRegisters are built both single pen and double pen. In the latter case,\r\nas the record of one wire is made with a fine pen, and the other with\r\na coarse pen, they can always be identified. The record being blocked\r\nout upon white tape in solid black color, in a series of clean-cut dots\r\nand dashes, it can be read at a glance, and as it is indelible, it may\r\nbe read years afterward. Registers are made for local circuits, for\r\nuse in connection with relays, or for direct use on main lines, as is\r\nusually desirable in fire-alarm circuits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 114.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTRIC BELL AND SOME OF ITS USES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 115.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 116.]\r\n\r\n=115. Automatic Current Interrupters= are used on most common bells,\r\nas well as on induction coils, etc. (See § 104.) Fig. 115 shows a\r\nsimple form of interrupter. The wire 1, from a cell D C, is joined to\r\nan iron strip I a short distance from its end. The other wire from D C\r\npasses to one end of the electromagnet coil H. The remaining end of H\r\nis placed in contact with I as shown, completing the circuit. As soon\r\nas the current passes, I is pulled down and away from the upper wire\r\n2, breaking the circuit. I, being held by its left-hand end firmly in\r\nthe hand, immediately springs back to its former position, closing the\r\ncircuit again. This action is repeated, the rapidity of the vibrations\r\ndepending somewhat upon the position of the wires on I. In regular\r\ninstruments a platinum point is used where the circuit is broken; this\r\nstands the sparking when the armature vibrates.\r\n\r\n=116. Electric Bells= may be illustrated by referring to Fig. 116,\r\nwhich shows a circuit similar to that described in § 115, but which\r\nalso contains a key K, in the circuit. This allows the circuit to\r\nbe opened and closed at a distance from the vibrating armature. The\r\ncircuit must not be broken at two places at the same time, so wires\r\nshould touch at the end of I before pressing K. Upon pressing K the\r\narmature I will vibrate rapidly. By placing a small bell near the end\r\nof the vibrating armature, so that it will be struck by I at each\r\nvibration, we should have a simple electric bell. This form of electric\r\nbell is called a _trembling_ bell, on account of its vibrating armature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 117.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 118.]\r\n\r\nFig. 117 shows a form of trembling bell with cover removed. Fig. 118\r\nshows a _single-stroke_ bell, used for fire-alarms and other signal\r\nwork. In this the armature is attracted but once each time the current\r\npasses. As many taps of the bell can be given as desired by pressing\r\nthe push-button. Fig. 119 shows a gong for railway crossings, signals,\r\netc. Fig. 120 shows a circuit including cell, push-button, and bell,\r\nwith extra wire for lengthening the line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 119.]\r\n\r\n_Electro-Mechanical Gongs_ are used to give loud signals for special\r\npurposes. The mechanical device is started by the electric current when\r\nthe armature of the electromagnet is attracted. Springs, weights, etc.,\r\nare used as the power. Fig. 121 shows a small bell of this kind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 120.]\r\n\r\n=117. Magneto Testing Bells=, Fig. 122, are really small hand-power\r\ndynamos. The armature is made to revolve between the poles of strong\r\npermanent magnets, and it is so wound that it gives a current with a\r\nlarge E. M. F., so that it can ring through the large resistance of a\r\nlong line to test it.\r\n\r\n_Magneto Signal Bells_, Fig. 123, are used as generator and bell in\r\nconnection with telephones. The generator, used to ring a bell at a\r\ndistant station, stands at the bottom of the box. The bell is fastened\r\nto the lid, and receives current from a distant bell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 121.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 122.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 123.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 124.]\r\n\r\n=118. Electric Buzzers= have the same general construction as electric\r\nbells; in fact, you will have a buzzer by removing the bell from an\r\nordinary electric bell. Buzzers are used in places where the loud sound\r\nof a bell would be objectionable. Fig. 124 shows the usual form of\r\nbuzzers, the cover being removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE TELEPHONE, AND HOW IT TRANSMITS SPEECH.\r\n\r\n\r\n=119. The Telephone= is an instrument for reproducing sounds at a\r\ndistance, and electricity is the agent by which this is generally\r\naccomplished. The part spoken to is called the _transmitter_, and\r\nthe part which gives sound out again is called the _receiver_. Sound\r\nitself does not pass over the line. While the same apparatus can be\r\nused for both transmitter and receiver, they are generally different in\r\nconstruction to get the best results.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 125.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 126.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 127.]\r\n\r\n=120. The Bell or Magneto-transmitter= generates its own current, and\r\nis, strictly speaking, a dynamo that is run by the voice. It depends\r\nupon induction for its action.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 128.]\r\n\r\nFig. 125 shows a coil of wire, H, with soft iron core, the ends of the\r\nwires being connected to a delicate galvanoscope. If one pole of the\r\nmagnet H M be suddenly moved up and down near the core, an alternating\r\ncurrent will be generated in the coil, the circuit being completed\r\nthrough the galvanoscope. As H M approaches the core the current will\r\nflow in one direction, and as H M is withdrawn it will pass in the\r\nopposite direction. The combination makes a miniature alternating\r\ndynamo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 129.]\r\n\r\nIf we imagine the soft iron core of H, Fig. 125, taken out, and one\r\npole of H M, or preferably that of a bar magnet stuck through the coil,\r\na feeble current will also be produced by moving the soft iron back and\r\nforth near the magnet's pole. This is really what is done in the Bell\r\ntransmitter, soft iron in the shape of a thin disc (D, Fig. 126) being\r\nmade to vibrate by the voice immediately in front of a coil having\r\na permanent magnet for a core. The disc, or _diaphragm_, as it is\r\ncalled, is fixed near, but it does not touch, the magnet. It is under\r\na constant strain, being attracted by the magnet, so its slightest\r\nmovement changes the strength of the magnetic field, causing more or\r\nless lines of force to shoot through the turns of the coil and induce a\r\ncurrent. The coil consists of many turns of fine, insulated wire. The\r\ncurrent generated is an alternating one, and although exceedingly small\r\ncan force its way through a long length of wire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 130.]\r\n\r\nFig. 127 shows a section of a regular transmitter, and Fig. 128 a form\r\nof compound magnet frequently used in the transmitter. Fig. 129 shows a\r\ntransmitter with cords which contain flexible wires.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 131.]\r\n\r\n=121. The Receiver=, for short lines, may have the same construction as\r\nthe Bell transmitter. Fig. 130 shows a diagram of two Bell receivers,\r\neither being used as the transmitter and the other as the receiver.\r\nAs the alternating current goes to the distant receiver, it flies\r\nthrough the coil first in one direction and then in the other. This\r\nalternately strengthens and weakens the magnetic field near the\r\ndiaphragm, causing it to vibrate back and forth as the magnet pulls\r\nmore or less. The receiver diaphragm repeats the vibrations in the\r\ntransmitter. Nothing but the induced electric current passes over the\r\nwires.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 132.]\r\n\r\n=122. The Microphone.= If a current of electricity be allowed to\r\npass through a circuit like that shown in Fig. 131, which includes a\r\nbattery, a Bell receiver, and a microphone, any slight sound near the\r\nmicrophone will be greatly magnified in the receiver. The microphone\r\nconsists of pieces of carbon so fixed that they form loose contacts.\r\nAny slight movement of the carbon causes the resistance to the current\r\nto be greatly changed. The rapidly varying resistance allows more or\r\nless current to pass, the result being that this pulsating current\r\ncauses the diaphragm to vibrate. The diaphragm has a constantly varying\r\npull upon it when the carbons are in any way disturbed by the voice, or\r\nby the ticking of a watch, etc. This principle has been made use of in\r\ncarbon transmitters, which are made in a large variety of forms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 133.]\r\n\r\n=123. The Carbon Transmitter= does not, in itself, generate a\r\ncurrent like the magneto-transmitter; it merely produces changes in\r\nthe strength of a current that flows through it and that comes from\r\nsome outside source. In Fig. 132, X and Y are two carbon buttons, X\r\nbeing attached to the diaphragm D. Button Y presses gently against X,\r\nallowing a little current to pass through the circuit which includes\r\na battery, D C, and a receiver, R. When D is caused to vibrate by the\r\nvoice, X is made to press more or less against Y, and this allows more\r\nor less current to pass through the circuit. This direct undulating\r\ncurrent changes the pull upon the diaphragm of R, causing it to vibrate\r\nand reproduce the original sounds spoken into the transmitter. In\r\nregular lines, of course, a receiver and transmitter are connected at\r\neach end, together with bells, etc., for signaling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 134.]\r\n\r\n=124. Induction Coils in Telephone Work.= As the resistance of long\r\ntelephone lines is great, a high electrical pressure, or E.M.F. is\r\ndesired. While the current from one or two cells is sufficient to work\r\nthe transmitter properly, and cause undulating currents in the short\r\nline, it does not have power enough to force its way over a long line.\r\n\r\nTo get around this difficulty, an induction coil, Fig. 133, is used\r\nto transform the battery current, that flows through the carbon\r\ntransmitter and primary coil, into a current with a high E. M. F. The\r\nbattery current in the primary coil is undulating, but always passes in\r\nthe same direction, making the magnetic field around the core weaker\r\nand stronger. This causes an alternating current in the secondary coil\r\nand main line. In Fig. 133 P and S represent the primary and secondary\r\ncoils. P is joined in series with a cell and carbon transmitter; S\r\nis joined to the distant receiver. One end of S can be grounded, the\r\ncurrent completing the circuit through the earth and into the receiver\r\nthrough another wire entering the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 135.]\r\n\r\n=125. Various forms= of telephones are shown in Figs. 134, 135, 136.\r\nFig. 134 shows a form of desk telephone; Fig. 135 shows a common form\r\nof wall telephone; Fig. 136 shows head-telephones for switchboard\r\noperators.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 136.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nHOW ELECTRICITY IS GENERATED BY DYNAMOS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=126. The Dynamo=, _Dynamo-Electric Machine_ or _Generator_, is a\r\nmachine for converting mechanical energy into an electric current,\r\nthrough electromagnetic induction. The dynamo is a machine that will\r\nconvert steam power, for example, into an electric current. Strictly\r\nspeaking, a dynamo creates electrical pressure, or electromotive force,\r\nand not electricity, just as a force-pump creates water-pressure, and\r\nnot water. They are generally run by steam or water power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 137.]\r\n\r\n=127. Induced Currents.= We have already spoken about currents being\r\ninduced by moving a coil of wire in a magnetic field. We shall now\r\nsee how this principle is used in the dynamo which is a generator of\r\ninduced currents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 138.]\r\n\r\nFig. 137 shows how a current can be generated by a bar magnet and\r\na coil of wire. Fig. 138 shows how a current can be generated by a\r\nhorseshoe magnet and a coil of wire having an iron core. The ends of\r\nthe coil are to be connected to an astatic galvanoscope; this forms a\r\nclosed circuit. The coil may be moved past the magnet, or the magnet\r\npast the coil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 139.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 140.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 141.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 142.]\r\n\r\nFig. 139 shows how a current can be generated by two coils, H being\r\nconnected to an astatic galvanoscope and E to a battery. By suddenly\r\nbringing E toward H or the core of E past that of H, a current is\r\nproduced. We have in this arrangement the main features of a dynamo.\r\nWe can reverse the operation, holding E in one position and moving H\r\nrapidly toward it. In this case H would represent the armature and E\r\nthe field-magnet. When H is moved toward E, the induced current in H\r\nflows in one direction, and when H is suddenly withdrawn from E the\r\ncurrent is reversed in H. (See \"Study,\" Chapter XXV., for experiments.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 143.]\r\n\r\n=128. Induced Currents by Rotary Motion.= The motions of the coils in\r\nstraight lines are not suitable for producing currents strong enough\r\nfor commercial purposes. In order to generate currents of considerable\r\nstrength and pressure, the coils of wire have to be pushed past\r\nmagnets, or electromagnets, with great speed. In the dynamo the coils\r\nare so wound that they can be given a rapid rotary motion as they fly\r\npast strong electromagnets. In this way the coil can keep on passing\r\nthe same magnets, in the same direction, as long as force is applied to\r\nthe shaft that carries them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 144.]\r\n\r\n=129. Field-Magnets; Armature; Commutator.= What we need then, to\r\nproduce an induced current by a rotary motion, is a strong magnetic\r\nfield, a rotating coil of wire properly placed in the field, and some\r\nmeans of leading the current from the machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 145.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 146.]\r\n\r\nIf a loop of wire, Fig. 140, be so arranged on bearings at its ends\r\nthat it can be made to revolve, a current will flow through it in\r\none direction during one-half of the revolution, and in the opposite\r\ndirection during the other half, it being insulated from all external\r\nconductors. This agrees with the experiments suggested in § 127, when\r\nthe current generated in a coil passed in one direction during its\r\nmotion _toward_ the strongest part of the field, and in the opposite\r\ndirection when the coil passed _out_ of it. A coil must be cut by\r\nlines of force to generate a current. A current inside of the machine,\r\nas in Fig. 140, would be of no value; it must be led out to external\r\nconductors where it can do work. Some sort of sliding contact is\r\nnecessary to connect a revolving conductor with outside stationary\r\nones. The magnet, called the _field-magnet_, is merely to furnish lines\r\nof magnetic force. The one turn of wire represents the simplest form of\r\n_armature_.\r\n\r\nFig. 141 shows the ends of a coil joined to two rings, X, Y, insulated\r\nfrom each other, and rotating with the coil. The two stationary pieces\r\nof carbon, A, B, called _brushes_, press against the rings, and to\r\nthese are joined wires, which complete the circuit, and which lead out\r\nwhere the current can do work. The arrows show the direction of the\r\ncurrent during one-half of a revolution. The rings form a _collector_,\r\nand this arrangement gives an _alternating current_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 147.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 142 the ends of the coil are joined to the two halves of a\r\ncylinder. These halves, X and Y, are insulated from each other, and\r\nfrom the axis. The current flows from X onto the brush A, through some\r\nexternal circuit, to do the work, and thence back through brush B onto\r\nY. By the time that Y gets around to A, the direction of the current in\r\nthe loop has reversed, so that it passes toward Y, but it still enters\r\nthe outside circuit through A, because Y is then in contact with A.\r\nThis device is called a _commutator_, and it allows a constant or\r\n_direct current_ to leave the machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 148.]\r\n\r\nIn regular machines, the field-magnets are electromagnets, the whole\r\nor a part of the current from the dynamo passing around them on its\r\nway out, to excite them and make a powerful field between the poles.\r\nTo lessen the resistance to the lines of force on their way from the\r\nN to the S pole of the field-magnets, the armature coils are wound on\r\nan iron core; this greatly increases the strength of the field, as\r\nthe lines of force have to jump across but two small air-gaps. There\r\nare many loops of wire on regular armatures, and many segments to the\r\ncommutator, carefully insulated from each other, each getting its\r\ncurrent from the coil attached to it.\r\n\r\n=130. Types of Dynamos.= While there is an almost endless number of\r\ndifferent makes and shapes of dynamos, they may be divided into two\r\ngreat types; the _continuous_ or _direct current_, and the _alternating\r\ncurrent_ dynamo. Direct current machines give out a current which\r\nconstantly flows in one direction, and this is because a commutator is\r\nused. Alternating currents come from collectors or rings, as shown in\r\nFig. 141; and as an alternating current cannot be used to excite the\r\nfields, an outside current from a small direct current machine must be\r\nused. These are called exciters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 149.]\r\n\r\nIn direct current machines enough residual magnetism is left in the\r\nfield to induce a slight current in the armature when the machine is\r\nstarted. This immediately adds strength to the field-magnets, which, in\r\nturn, induce a stronger current in the armature.\r\n\r\n=131. Winding of Dynamos.= There are several ways of winding dynamos,\r\ndepending upon the special uses to be made of the current.\r\n\r\nThe _series wound_ dynamo, Fig. 143, is so arranged that the entire\r\ncurrent passes around the field-magnet cores on its way from the\r\nmachine. In the _shunt wound_ dynamo, Fig. 144, a part, only, of the\r\ncurrent from the machine is carried around the field-magnet cores\r\nthrough many turns of fine wire. The _compound wound_ dynamo is really\r\na combination of the two methods just given. In _separately-excited_\r\ndynamos, the current from a separate machine is used to excite the\r\nfield-magnets.\r\n\r\n=132. Various Machines.= Fig. 145 shows a hand power dynamo\r\nwhich produces a current for experimental work. Fig. 146 shows a\r\nmagneto-electrical generator which produces a current for medical use.\r\nFigs. 147, 148 show forms of dynamos, and Fig. 149 shows how arc lamps\r\nare connected in series to dynamos.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nHOW THE ELECTRIC CURRENT IS TRANSFORMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n=133. Electric Current and Work.= The amount of work a current can do\r\ndepends upon two factors; the strength (amperes), and the pressure,\r\nor E. M. F. (volts). A current of 10 amperes with a pressure of 1,000\r\nvolts = 10 × 1,000 = 10,000 watts. This furnishes the same amount of\r\nenergy as a current of 50 amperes at 200 volts; 50 × 200 = 10,000 watts.\r\n\r\n=134. Transmission of Currents.= It is often necessary to carry a\r\ncurrent a long distance before it is used. A current of 50 amperes\r\nwould need a copper conductor 25 times as large (sectional area) as one\r\nto carry the 10 ampere current mentioned in § 133. As copper conductors\r\nare very expensive, electric light companies, etc., generally try to\r\ncarry the current on as small a wire as possible. To do this, the\r\nvoltage is kept high, and the amperage low. Thus, as seen in § 133,\r\nthe current of 1,000 volts and 10 amperes could be carried on a much\r\nsmaller wire than the other current of equal energy. A current of\r\n1,000 volts, however, is not adapted for lights, etc., so it has to be\r\nchanged to lower voltage by some form of transformer before it can be\r\nused.\r\n\r\n=135. Transformers=, like induction coils, are instruments for changing\r\nthe E. M. F. and strength of currents. There is very little loss of\r\nenergy in well-made transformers. They consist of two coils of wire on\r\none core; in fact, an induction coil may be considered a transformer,\r\nbut in this a direct current has to be interrupted. If the secondary\r\ncoil has 100 times as many turns of wire as the primary, a current of\r\n100 volts can be taken from the secondary coil when the primary current\r\nis but 1 volt; but the _strength_ (amperes) of this new current will be\r\nbut one-hundredth that of the primary current.\r\n\r\nBy using the coil of fine wire as the primary, we can lower the voltage\r\nand increase the strength in the same proportion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 150.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 151.]\r\n\r\nFig. 150 shows about the simplest form of transformer with a solid iron\r\ncore, on which are wound two coils, the one, P, being the primary, and\r\nthe other, S, the secondary. Fig. 151 shows the general appearance of\r\none make of transformer. The operation of this apparatus, as already\r\nmentioned, is to reduce the high pressure alternating current sent out\r\nover the conductors from the dynamo, to a potential at which it can\r\nbe employed with convenience and safety, for illumination and other\r\npurposes. They consist of two or more coils of wire most carefully\r\ninsulated from one another. A core or magnetic circuit of soft iron,\r\ncomposed of very thin punchings, is then formed around these coils,\r\nthe purpose of the iron core being to reduce the magnetic resistance\r\nand increase the inductive effect. One set of these coils is connected\r\nwith the primary or high-pressure wires, while the other set, which are\r\ncalled the secondary coils, is connected to the house or low-pressure\r\nwires, or wherever the current is required for use. The rapidly\r\nalternating current impulses in the primary or high-pressure wires\r\ninduce secondary currents similar in form but opposite in direction\r\nin the secondary coils. These current impulses are of a much lower\r\npressure, depending upon the ratio of the number of turns of wire\r\nin the respective coils, it being customary to wind transformers in\r\nsuch a manner as to reduce from 1,000 or 2,000-volt primaries to 50\r\nor 100-volt secondaries, at which voltage the secondary current is\r\nperfectly harmless.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 152.]\r\n\r\n=136. Motor-Dynamos.= Fig. 152. These consist essentially of two\r\nbelt-type machines on a common base, direct coupled together, one\r\nmachine acting as a motor to receive current at a certain voltage,\r\nand the other acting as a dynamo to give out the current usually\r\nat a different voltage. As they transform current from one voltage\r\nto another, motor-dynamos are sometimes called Double Field Direct\r\nCurrent Transformers. The larger sizes have three bearings, one bearing\r\nbeing between the two machines, while the smaller sizes have but two\r\nbearings, the two armatures being fastened to a common spider.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 153.]\r\n\r\n_Applications._ The uses to which motor-dynamos are put are very\r\nvarious. They are extensively used in the larger sizes as \"Boosters,\"\r\nfor giving the necessary extra force on long electric supply circuits\r\nto carry the current to the end with the same pressure as that which\r\nreaches the ends of the shorter circuits from the station.\r\n\r\nMotor-dynamos have the advantage over dynamotors, described later, of\r\nhaving the secondary voltage easily and economically varied over wide\r\nranges by means of a regulator in the dynamo field.\r\n\r\n=137. Dynamotors.= Fig. 153. In Dynamotors the motor and dynamo\r\narmatures are combined in one, thus requiring a single field only.\r\nThe primary armature winding, which operates as a motor to drive the\r\nmachine, and the secondary or dynamo winding, which operates as a\r\ngenerator to produce a new current, are upon the same armature core,\r\nso that the armature reaction of one winding neutralizes that of the\r\nother. They therefore have no tendency to spark, and do not require\r\nshifting of the brushes with varying load. Having but one field and two\r\nbearings, they are also more efficient than motor-dynamos.\r\n\r\n_Applications._ They have largely displaced batteries for telegraph\r\nwork. The size shown, occupying a space of about 8-inch cube, and\r\nhaving an output of 40 watts, will displace about 800 gravity cells,\r\noccupying a space of about 10 feet cube. The cost of maintenance of\r\nsuch a battery per year, exclusive of rent, is about $800, whereas the\r\n1-6 dynamotor can be operated at an annual expense of $150.\r\n\r\nDynamotors are largely used by telephone companies for charging storage\r\nbatteries, and for transforming from direct to alternating current, for\r\nringing telephone bells. Electro-cautery, electroplating, and electric\r\nheating also give use to dynamotors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nHOW ELECTRIC CURRENTS ARE DISTRIBUTED FOR USE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 154.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 155.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 156.]\r\n\r\n=138. Conductors and Insulators.= To carry the powerful current from\r\nthe generating station to distant places where it is to give heat,\r\npower, or light, or even to carry the small current of a single cell\r\nfrom one room to another, _conductors_ must be used. To keep the\r\ncurrent from passing into the earth before it reaches its destination\r\n_insulators_ must be used. The form of conductors and insulators used\r\nwill depend upon the current and many other conditions. It should be\r\nremembered that the current has to be carried to the lamp or motor,\r\nthrough which it passes, and then back again to the dynamo, to form a\r\ncomplete circuit. A break anywhere in the circuit stops the current.\r\nInsulators are as important as conductors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 157.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 158.]\r\n\r\n=139. Mains, Service Wires, etc.= From the switchboard the current\r\nflows out through the streets in large conductors, or _mains_, the\r\nsupply being kept up by the dynamos, just as water-pressure is kept up\r\nby the constant working of pumps. Branches, called _service wires_, are\r\nled off from the mains to supply houses or factories, one wire leading\r\nthe current into the house from one main, and a similar one leading it\r\nout of the house again to the other main.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 159.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 160.]\r\n\r\nIn large buildings, pairs of wires, called _risers_, branch out from\r\nthe service wires and carry the current up through the building. These\r\nhave still other branches--_floor mains_, _etc._, that pass through\r\nhalls, etc., smaller branches finally reaching the lamps. The sizes of\r\nall of these wires depend upon how much current has to pass through\r\nthem. The mains in large cities are usually placed underground. In some\r\nplaces they are carried on poles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 161.]\r\n\r\n=140. Electric Conduits= are underground passages for electric wires,\r\ncables, etc. There are several ways of insulating the conductors.\r\nSometimes they are placed in earthenware or iron tubes, or in wood that\r\nhas been treated to make it water-proof. At short distances are placed\r\nman-holes, where the different lengths are joined, and where branches\r\nare attached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 162.]\r\n\r\nFig. 154 shows creosoted wooden pipes; Fig. 155 shows another form of\r\nwooden pipe. Fig. 156 shows a coupling-box used to join Edison tubes.\r\nThe three wires, used in the three-wire system, are insulated from each\r\nother, the whole being surrounded by an iron pipe of convenient length\r\nfor handling. Fig. 157 shows sections of man-holes and various devices\r\nused in conduit work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 163.]\r\n\r\n=141. Miscellaneous Appliances.= When the current enters a house for\r\nincandescent lighting purposes, for example, quite a number of things\r\nare necessary. To measure the current a meter is usually placed in the\r\ncellar. In new houses the insulated conductors are usually run through\r\nsome sort of tube which acts as a double protection, all being hidden\r\nfrom view. Fig. 158 shows a short length of iron tube with a lining of\r\ninsulating material. Wires are often run through tubes made of rubber\r\nand various other insulating materials.\r\n\r\nWhere the current is to be put into houses after the plastering has\r\nbeen done, the wires are usually run through _mouldings_ or supported\r\nby _cleats_. Fig. 159 shows a cross-section of moulding. The insulated\r\nwires are placed in the slots, which are then covered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 164.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 165.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 166.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 167.]\r\n\r\nFig. 160 shows a form of porcelain cleat. These are fastened to\r\nceilings or walls, and firmly hold the insulated wires in place. Fig.\r\n161 shows a wood cleat. Fig. 162 shows small porcelain _insulators_.\r\nThese may be screwed to walls, etc., the wire being then fastened to\r\nthem. Fig. 163 shows how telegraph wires are supported and insulated.\r\nFig. 164 shows how wires may be carried by tree and insulated from them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 168.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 169.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 170.]\r\n\r\n=142. Safety Devices.= We have seen that when too large a current\r\npasses through a wire, the wire becomes heated and may even be melted.\r\nBuildings are wired to use certain currents, and if from any cause much\r\nmore current than the regular amount should suddenly pass through the\r\nservice wires into the house, the various smaller wires would become\r\noverheated, and perhaps melt or start a fire. An accidental short\r\ncircuit, for example, would so reduce resistance that too much current\r\nwould suddenly rush through the wires. There are several devices by\r\nwhich the over-heating of wires is obviated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 171 to 175.]\r\n\r\nFig. 165 shows a _safety fuse_, or _safety cut-out_, which consists of\r\na short length of easily fusible wire, called _fuse wire_, placed in\r\nthe circuit and supported by a porcelain block. These wires are tested,\r\ndifferent sizes being used for different currents. As soon as there\r\nis any tendency toward over-heating, the fuse _blows_; that is, it\r\npromptly melts and opens the circuit before any damage can be done to\r\nthe regular conductors. Fig. 166 shows a cross-section of a _fuse plug_\r\nthat can be screwed into an ordinary socket. The fuse wire is shown\r\nblack.\r\n\r\nFig. 167 shows a _fuse link_. These are also of fusible material, and\r\nso made that they can be firmly held under screw-heads. For heavy\r\ncurrents _fuse ribbons_ are used, or several wires or links may be\r\nused side by side. Fig. 168 shows a _fusible rosette_. Fig. 169 shows\r\ntwo fuse wires fixed between screw-heads, the current passing through\r\nthem in opposite directions, both sides of the circuit being included.\r\nFig. 170 shows various forms of cut-outs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 176.]\r\n\r\n=143. Wires and Cables= are made in many sizes. Figs. 171 to 175 show\r\nvarious ways of making small conductors. They are made very flexible,\r\nfor some purposes, by twisting many small copper wires together, the\r\nwhole being then covered with insulating material.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 177.]\r\n\r\nFigs. 176, 177, show sections of submarine cables. Such cables consist\r\nof copper conductors insulated with pure gutta-percha. These are then\r\nsurrounded by hempen yarn or other elastic material, and around the\r\nwhole are placed galvanized iron armor wires for protection. Each core,\r\nor conductor, contains a conductor consisting of a single copper wire\r\nor a strand of three or more twisted copper wires.\r\n\r\n=144. Lamp Circuits.= As has been noted before, in order to have the\r\nelectric current do its work, we must have a complete circuit. The\r\ncurrent must be brought back to the dynamo, much of it, of course,\r\nhaving been used to produce light, heat, power, etc. For lighting\r\npurposes this is accomplished in two principal ways.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 178.]\r\n\r\nFig. 178 shows a number of lamps so arranged, \"in series,\" that the\r\nsame current passes through them all, one after the other. The total\r\nresistance of the circuit is large, as all of the lamp resistances are\r\nadded together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 179.]\r\n\r\nFig. 179 shows lamps arranged side by side, or \"in parallel,\" between\r\nthe two main wires. The current divides, a part going through each lamp\r\nthat operates. The total resistance of the circuit is not as large\r\nas in the series arrangement, as the current has many small paths in\r\ngoing from one main wire to the other. Fig. 179 also shows the ordinary\r\n_two-wire system_ for incandescent lighting, the two main wires having\r\nusually a difference of potential equal to 50 or 110 volts. These\r\ncomparatively small pressures require fairly large conductors.\r\n\r\n_The Three-Wire System_, Fig. 180, uses the current from two dynamos,\r\narranged with three main wires. While the total voltage is 220, one of\r\nthe wires being neutral, 110 volts can be had for ordinary lamps. This\r\nvoltage saves in the cost of conductors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 180.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 181.]\r\n\r\n_The Alternating System_, Fig. 181, uses transformers. The high\r\npotential of the current allows small main wires, from which branches\r\ncan be run to the primary coil of the transformer. The secondary coil\r\nsends out an induced current of 50 or 110 volts, while that in the\r\nprimary may be 1,000 to 10,000 volts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nHOW HEAT IS PRODUCED BY THE ELECTRIC CURRENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n=145. Resistance and Heat.= We have seen that all wires and conductors\r\noffer resistance to the electric current. The smaller the wire the\r\ngreater its resistance. Whenever resistance is offered to the current,\r\nheat is produced. By proper appliances, the heat of resistance can be\r\nused to advantage for many commercial enterprises. Dynamos are used to\r\ngenerate the current for heating and lighting purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 182.]\r\n\r\nFig. 182 shows how the current from two strong cells can be used to\r\nheat a short length of very fine platinum or German-silver wire.\r\nThe copper conductors attached to the cells do not offer very much\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the above that in all electrical work the sizes\r\nof the wires used have to be such that they do not overheat. The coils\r\nof dynamos, motors, transformers, ampere-meters, etc., etc., become\r\nsomewhat heated by the currents passing through them, great care being\r\ntaken that they are properly designed and ventilated so that they will\r\nnot burn out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 183.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 184.]\r\n\r\n=146. Electric Welding.= Fig. 183 shows one form of electric welding\r\nmachine. The principle involved in the art of electric welding is\r\nthat of causing currents of electricity to pass through the abutting\r\nends of the pieces of metal which are to be welded, thereby generating\r\nheat at the point of contact, which also becomes the point of greatest\r\nresistance, while at the same time mechanical pressure is applied\r\nto force the parts together. As the current heats the metal at the\r\njunction to the welding temperature, the pressure follows up the\r\nsoftening surface until a complete union or weld is effected; and, as\r\nthe heat is first developed in the interior of the parts to be welded,\r\nthe interior of the joint is as efficiently united as the visible\r\nexterior. With such a method and apparatus, it is found possible to\r\naccomplish not only the common kinds of welding of iron and steel, but\r\nalso of metals which have heretofore resisted attempts at welding, and\r\nhave had to be brazed or soldered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 185 to 189.]\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the electric transformer enables enormous currents\r\nto be so applied to the weld as to spend their energy just at the point\r\nwhere heating is required. They need, therefore, only to be applied\r\nfor a few seconds, and the operation is completed before the heat\r\ngenerated at the weld has had time to escape by conduction to any other\r\npart.\r\n\r\nAlthough the quantity of the current so employed in the pieces to be\r\nwelded is enormous, the potential at which it is applied is extremely\r\nlow, not much exceeding that of the batteries of cells used for ringing\r\nelectric bells in houses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 190.]\r\n\r\n=147. Miscellaneous Applications.= Magneto Blasting Machines are now\r\nin very common use for blasting rocks, etc. Fig. 184 shows one, it\r\nbeing really a small hand dynamo, occupying less than one-half a cubic\r\nfoot of space. The armature is made to revolve rapidly between the\r\npoles of the field-magnet by means of a handle that works up and down.\r\nThe current is carried by wires from the binding-posts to fuses. The\r\nheat generated by resistance in the fuse ignites the powder or other\r\nexplosive.\r\n\r\n_Electric soldering irons_, _flat-irons_, _teakettles_, _griddles_,\r\n_broilers_, _glue pots_, _chafing-dishes_, _stoves_, etc., etc., are\r\nnow made. Figs. 185 to 189 show some of these applications. The coils\r\nfor producing the resistance are inclosed in the apparatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 191.]\r\n\r\nFig. 190 shows a complete electric kitchen. Any kettle or part of the\r\noutfit can be made hot by simply turning a switch. Fig. 191 shows an\r\nelectric heater placed under a car seat. Many large industries that\r\nmake use of the heating effects of the current are now being carried\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nHOW LIGHT IS PRODUCED BY THE INCANDESCENT LAMP.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 192.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 193.]\r\n\r\n=148. Incandescence.= We have just seen that the electric current\r\nproduces heat when it flows through a conductor that offers\r\nconsiderable resistance to it. As soon as this was discovered men\r\nbegan to experiment to find whether a practical light could also be\r\nproduced. It was found that a wire could be kept hot by constantly\r\npassing a current through it, and that the light given out from it\r\nbecame whiter and whiter as the wire became hotter. The wire was said\r\nto be _incandescent_, or glowing with heat. As metal wires are good\r\nconductors of electricity, they had to be made extremely fine to offer\r\nenough resistance; too fine, in fact, to be properly handled.\r\n\r\n=149. The Incandescent Lamp.= Many substances were experimented upon\r\nto find a proper material out of which could be made a _filament_\r\nthat would give the proper resistance and at the same time be strong\r\nand lasting. It was found that hair-like pieces of carbon offered the\r\nproper resistance to the current. When heated in the air, however,\r\ncarbon burns; so it became necessary to place the carbon filaments in a\r\nglobe from which all the air had been pumped before passing the current\r\nthrough them. This proved to be a success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 194.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 195.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 196.]\r\n\r\nFig. 192 shows the ordinary form of lamp. The _carbon filament_ is\r\nattached, by carbon paste, to short platinum wires that are sealed in\r\nthe glass, their lower ends being connected to short copper wires that\r\nare joined to the terminals of the lamp. When the lamp is screwed\r\ninto its socket, the current can pass up one side of the filament\r\nand down the other. The filaments used have been made of every form\r\nof carbonized vegetable matter. Bamboo has been largely used, fine\r\nstrips being cut by dies and then heated in air-tight boxes containing\r\nfine carbon until they were thoroughly carbonized. This baking of the\r\nbamboo produces a tough fiber of carbon. Various forms of thread have\r\nbeen carbonized and used. Filaments are now made by pressing finely\r\npulverized carbon, with a binding material, through small dies. The\r\nfilaments are made of such sizes and lengths that will adapt them to\r\nthe particular current with which they are to be used. The longer the\r\nfilament, the greater its resistance, and the greater the voltage\r\nnecessary to push the current through it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 197.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 198.]\r\n\r\nAfter the filaments are properly attached, the air is pumped from the\r\nbulb or globe. This is done with some form of mercury pump, and the air\r\nis so thoroughly removed from the bulb that about one-millionth only of\r\nthe original air remains. Before sealing off the lamp, a current is\r\npassed through the filament to drive out absorbed air and gases, and\r\nthese are carried away by the pump. By proper treatment the filaments\r\nhave a uniform resistance throughout, and glow uniformly when the\r\ncurrent passes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 199.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 200.]\r\n\r\n=150. Candle-Power.= A lamp is said to have 4, 8, 16 or more\r\ncandle-power. A 16-candle-power lamp, for example, means one that will\r\ngive as much light as sixteen standard candles. A standard sperm candle\r\nburns two grains a minute. The candle-power of a lamp can be increased\r\nby forcing a strong current through it, but this shortens its life.\r\n\r\n_The Current_ used for incandescent lamps has to be strong enough to\r\nforce its way through the filament and produce a heat sufficient to\r\ngive a good light. The usual current has 50 or 110 volts, although\r\nsmall lamps are made that can be run by two or three cells. If the\r\nvoltage of the current is less than that for which the lamp was made,\r\nthe light will be dim. The filament can be instantly burned out by\r\npassing a current of too high pressure through it.\r\n\r\nEven with the proper current, lamps soon begin to deteriorate, as small\r\nparticles of carbon leave the filament and cling to the glass. This is\r\ndue to the evaporation, and it makes the filament smaller, and a higher\r\npressure is then needed to force the current through the increased\r\nresistance; besides this, the darkened bulb does not properly let the\r\nlight out. The current may be direct or alternating.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 201.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 202.]\r\n\r\n=151. The Uses= to which incandescent lamps are put are almost\r\nnumberless. Fig. 193 shows a decorative lamp. Fancy lamps are made in\r\nall colors. Fig. 194 shows a conic candle lamp, to imitate a candle.\r\nWhat corresponds to the body of the candle (see figure B to C) is a\r\ndelicately tinted opal glass tube surmounted (see figure A to B) by a\r\nfinely proportioned conic lamp with frosted globe. C to D in the figure\r\nrepresents the regular base, and thus the relative proportions of the\r\nparts are shown. Fig. 195 shows another form of candelabra lamp. Fig.\r\n196 shows small dental lamps. Fig. 197 shows a small lamp with mirror\r\nfor use in the throat. Fig. 198 shows lamp with half shade attached,\r\nused for library tables. Fig. 199 shows an electric pendant for several\r\nlamps, with shade. Fig. 200 shows a lamp guard. Fig. 201 shows a lamp\r\nsocket, into which the lamp is screwed. Fig. 202 shows incandescent\r\nbulbs joined in parallel to the + and - mains. Fig. 203 shows how the\r\nlamp cord can be adjusted to desired length. Fig. 204 shows a lamp\r\nwith reflector placed on a desk. Fig. 205 shows a form of shade and\r\nreflector.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 203.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 204.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 205.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nHOW LIGHT IS PRODUCED BY THE ARC LAMP.\r\n\r\n\r\n=152. The Electric Arc.= When a strong current passes from one carbon\r\nrod to another across an air-space, an _electric arc_ is produced.\r\nWhen the ends of two carbon rods touch, a current can pass from one to\r\nthe other, but the imperfect contact causes resistance enough to heat\r\nthe ends red-hot. If the rods be separated slightly, the current will\r\ncontinue to flow, as the intensely heated air and flying particles of\r\ncarbon reduce the resistance of the air-space.\r\n\r\nFig. 206 shows two carbon rods which are joined to the two terminals\r\nof a dynamo. The upper, or positive, carbon gradually wears away and\r\nbecomes slightly hollow. The heated _crater_, as it is called, is the\r\nhottest part. The negative carbon becomes pointed. The arc will pass in\r\na vacuum, and even under water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 206.]\r\n\r\nAs the electric arc is extremely hot, metals are easily vaporized in\r\nit; in fact, even the carbon rods themselves slowly melt and vaporize.\r\nThis extreme heat is used for many industrial purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 207.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 208.]\r\n\r\n\"The phenomenon of the electric arc was first noticed by Humphrey\r\nDavy in 1800, and its explanation appears to be the following: Before\r\ncontact the difference of potential between the points is insufficient\r\nto permit a spark to leap across even 1/10000 of an inch of air-space,\r\nbut when the carbons are made to touch, a current is established.\r\nOn separating the carbons, the momentary extra current due to\r\nself-induction of the circuit, which possesses a high electromotive\r\nforce, can leap the short distance, and in doing so volatilizes a small\r\nquantity of carbon between the points. Carbon vapor, being a partial\r\nconductor, allows the current to continue to flow across the gap,\r\nprovided it be not too wide; but as the carbon vapor has a very high\r\nresistance it becomes intensely heated by the passage of the current,\r\nand the carbon points also grow hot. Since, however, solid matter is a\r\nbetter radiator than gaseous matter, the carbon points emit far more\r\nlight than the arc itself, though they are not so hot. It is observed,\r\nalso, that particles of carbon are torn away from the + electrode,\r\nwhich becomes hollowed out to a cup-shape, and some of these are\r\ndeposited on the - electrode.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 209.]\r\n\r\n=153. Arc Lamps.= As the carbons gradually wear away, some device is\r\nnecessary to keep their ends the right distance apart. If they are too\r\nnear, the arc is very small; and if too far apart, the current can not\r\npass and the light goes out. The positive carbon gives the more intense\r\nlight and wears away about twice as fast as the - carbon, so it is\r\nplaced above the - carbon, to throw the light downwards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 210.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 211.]\r\n\r\nArc lamps contain some device by which the proper distance between\r\nthe carbons can be kept. Most of them grip the upper carbon and pull\r\nit far enough above the lower one to establish the arc. As soon as\r\nthe distance between them gets too great again, the grip on the upper\r\ncarbon is loosened, allowing the carbon to drop until it comes in\r\ncontact with the lower one, thus starting the current again. These\r\nmotions are accomplished by electromagnets. Fig. 207 shows a form of\r\narc lamp with _single carbons_ that will burn from 7 to 9 hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 212.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 213.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 214.]\r\n\r\nFig. 208 shows the mechanism by which the carbons are regulated. Fig.\r\n209 shows a form of _double carbon_, or _all-night_ lamp, one set of\r\ncarbons being first used, the other set being automatically switched in\r\nat the proper time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 215.]\r\n\r\nFigs. 210, 211 show forms of _short arc lamps_, for use under low\r\nceilings, so common in basements, etc.\r\n\r\nFig. 212 shows a _hand-feed focussing_ type of _arc lamp_. In regular\r\nstreet lamps, the upper carbon only is fed by mechanism, as it burns\r\naway about twice as fast as the lower one, thus bringing the arc lower\r\nand lower. When it is desired to keep the arc at the focus of a\r\nreflector, both carbons must be fed.\r\n\r\nFig. 213 shows a _theatre arc lamp_, used to throw a strong beam of\r\nlight from the balcony to the stage.\r\n\r\nFig. 214 shows the arc lamp used as a search-light. The reflector\r\nthrows a powerful beam of light that can be seen for miles; in\r\nfact, the light is used for signalling at night. Fig. 215 shows how\r\nsearch-lights are used at night on war-vessels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nX-RAYS, AND HOW THE BONES OF THE HUMAN BODY ARE PHOTOGRAPHED.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 216.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 217.]\r\n\r\n=154. Disruptive Discharges.= We have seen, in the study of induction\r\ncoils, that a spark can jump several inches between the terminals\r\nof the secondary coil. The attraction between the two oppositely\r\ncharged terminals gets so great that it overcomes the resistance of\r\nthe air-space between them, a brilliant spark passes, and they are\r\ndischarged. This sudden discharge is said to be _disruptive_, and it\r\nis accompanied by a flash of light and a loud report. The _path_ of\r\nthe discharge may be nearly straight, or crooked, depending upon the\r\nnature of the material in the gap between the terminals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 218.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 219.]\r\n\r\n=155. Effect of Air Pressure on Spark.= The disruptive spark takes\r\nplace in air at ordinary pressures. The nature of the spark is greatly\r\nchanged when the pressure of the air decreases. Fig. 216 shows an\r\nair-tight glass tube so arranged that the air can be slowly removed\r\nwith an air-pump. The upper rod shown can be raised or lowered to\r\nincrease the distance between it and the lower rod, these acting as the\r\nterminals of an induction coil. Before exhausting any air, the spark\r\nwill jump a small distance between the rods and act as in open air. As\r\nsoon as a small amount of air is removed, a change takes place. The\r\nspark is not so intense and has no definite path, there being a general\r\nglow throughout the tube. As the air pressure becomes still less, the\r\nglow becomes brighter, until the entire tube is full of purple light\r\nthat is able to pass the entire length of it; that is, the discharge\r\ntakes place better in rarefied air than it does in ordinary air.\r\n\r\n=156. Vacuum-Tubes.= As electricity passes through rarefied gases much\r\neasier than through ordinary air, regular tubes, called _vacuum-tubes_,\r\nare made for such study. Fig. 217 shows a plain tube of this kind,\r\nplatinum terminals being fused in the glass for connections. These\r\ntubes are often made in complicated forms, Fig. 218, with colored\r\nglass, and are called _Geissler tubes_. They are often made in such a\r\nway that the electrodes are in the shape of discs, etc., and are called\r\n_Crookes tubes_, Fig. 219. A slight amount of gas is left in the tubes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 220.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 220-A.]\r\n\r\n=157. Cathode Rays.= The _cathode_ is the electrode of a vacuum-tube\r\nby which the current leaves the tube, and it has been known for some\r\ntime that some kind of influence passes in straight lines from this\r\npoint. Shadows, Fig. 219, are cast by such rays, a screen being placed\r\nin their path.\r\n\r\n=158. X-Rays.= Professor Roentgen of Würzburg discovered that when the\r\ncathode rays are allowed to fall upon a solid body, the solid body\r\ngives out still other rays which differ somewhat from the original\r\ncathode rays. They can penetrate, more or less, through many bodies\r\nthat are usually considered opaque. The hand, for example, may be used\r\nas a negative for producing a photograph of the bones, as the rays do\r\nnot pass equally well through flesh and bone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 221.]\r\n\r\nFig. 220 shows a Crookes tube fitted with a metal plate, so that\r\nthe cathode rays coming from C will strike it. The X-rays are given\r\nout from P. These rays are invisible and are even given out where\r\nthe cathode rays strike the glass. Some chemical compounds are made\r\nluminous by these rays; so screens are made and coated with them in\r\norder that the shadows produced by the X-rays can be seen by the\r\neye. Professor Roentgen named these the X-rays. Fig. 220-A shows a\r\n_fluoroscope_ that contains a screen covered with proper chemicals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 222.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 223.]\r\n\r\n=159. X-Ray Photographs.= Bone does not allow the X-rays to pass\r\nthrough it as readily as flesh, so if the hand be placed over a\r\nsensitized photographic plate, Fig. 221, and proper connections be\r\nmade with the induction coil, etc., the hand acts as a photographic\r\nnegative. Upon developing the plate, as in ordinary photography,\r\na picture or shadow of the bones will be seen. Fig. 222 shows the\r\narrangement of battery, induction coil, focus tube, etc., for examining\r\nthe bones of the human body.\r\n\r\nFig. 223 shows the bones of a fish. Such photographs have been very\r\nvaluable in discovering the location of bullets, needles, etc., that\r\nhave become imbedded in the flesh, as well as in locating breaks in the\r\nbones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTRIC MOTOR, AND HOW IT DOES WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n=160. Currents and Motion.= We have seen, Chapter XII., that when coils\r\nof wire are rapidly moved across a strong magnetic field, a current\r\nof electricity is generated. We have now to deal with the opposite of\r\nthis; that is, we are to study how _motion_ can be produced by allowing\r\na current of electricity to pass through the armature of a machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 224.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 225.]\r\n\r\nFig. 224 shows, by diagram, a coil H, suspended so that it can move\r\neasily, its ends being joined to a current reverser, and this, in turn,\r\nto a dry cell D C. A magnet, H M, will attract the core of H when\r\nno current passes. When the current is allowed to pass first in one\r\ndirection and then in the opposite direction, by using the reverser,\r\nthe core of H will jump back and forth from one pole of H M to the\r\nother. There are many ways by which motion can be produced by the\r\ncurrent, but to have it practical, the motion must be a rotary one.\r\n(See \"Study,\" Chapter XXVI., for numerous experiments.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 226.]\r\n\r\n=161. The Electric Motor= is a machine for transforming electric\r\nenergy into mechanical power. The construction of motors is very\r\nsimilar to that of dynamos. They have field-magnets, armature coils,\r\ncommutator, etc.; in fact, the armature of an ordinary direct current\r\ndynamo will revolve if a current be passed through it, entering by one\r\nbrush and leaving by the other. There are many little differences of\r\nconstruction, for mechanical and electrical reasons, but we may say\r\nthat the general construction of dynamos and motors is the same.\r\n\r\nFig. 225 shows a coil of wire, the ends of which are connected to\r\ncopper and zinc plates. These plates are floated in dilute sulphuric\r\nacid, and form a simple cell which sends a current through the wire, as\r\nshown by the arrows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 227.]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that a current-carrying wire has a magnetic field and\r\nacts like a magnet; so it will be easily seen that if a magnet be held\r\nnear the wire it will be either attracted or repelled, the motion\r\ndepending upon the poles that come near each other. As shown in the\r\nfigure, the N pole of the magnet repels the field of the wire, causing\r\nit to revolve. We see that this action is just the reverse to that in\r\ngalvanometers, where the coil is fixed, and the magnet, or magnetic\r\nneedle, is allowed to move. As soon as the part of the wire, marked A\r\nin Fig. 225, gets a little distance from the pole, the opposite side\r\nof the wire, B, begins to be attracted by it, the attraction getting\r\nstronger and stronger, until it gets opposite the N pole. If the N pole\r\nwere still held in place, B would vibrate back and forth a few times,\r\nand finally come to rest near the pole. If, however, as soon as B gets\r\nopposite N the S pole of the magnet be quickly turned toward B, the\r\ncoil will be repelled and the rotary motion will continue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 228.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 229 to 231.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 232.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 233.]\r\n\r\nLet us now see how this helps to explain electric motors. We may\r\nconsider the wire of Fig. 225 as one coil of an armature, and the\r\nplates, C and Z, as the halves of a commutator. In this arrangement, it\r\nmust be noted, the current always flows through the armature coil in\r\nthe same direction, the rotation being kept up by reversing the poles\r\nof the field-magnet. In ordinary simple motors the current is reversed\r\nin the armature coils, the field-magnets remaining in one position\r\nwithout changing the poles. This produces the same effect as the above.\r\nThe current is reversed automatically as the brushes allow the current\r\nto enter first one commutator bar and then the opposite one as the\r\narmature revolves. The regular armatures have many coils and many\r\ncommutator bars, as will be seen by examining the illustrations shown.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary galvanometer may be considered a form of motor. By\r\nproperly opening and closing the circuit, the rotary motion of the\r\nneedle can be kept up as long as current is supplied. Even an electric\r\nbell or telegraph sounder may be considered a motor, giving motion\r\nstraight forward and back.\r\n\r\n=162. The Uses of Motors= are many. It would be impossible to mention\r\nall the things that are done with the power from motors. A few\r\nillustrations will give an idea of the way motors are attached to\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\nFig. 226 shows one form of motor, the parts being shown in Fig. 227.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 234.]\r\n\r\nFig. 228 shows a fan motor run by a battery. They are generally run\r\nby the current from the street. Figs. 229-231 show other forms of fan\r\nmotors. Fig. 232 shows an electric hat polisher. A church organ bellows\r\nis shown in Fig. 233, so arranged that it can be pumped by an electric\r\nmotor. Fig. 234 shows a motor direct connected to a drill press.\r\n\r\n=163. Starting Boxes.= If too much current were suddenly allowed to\r\npass into the armature of a motor, the coils would be over-heated,\r\nand perhaps destroyed, before it attained its full speed. A rapidly\r\nrevolving armature will take more current, without being overheated,\r\nthan one not in motion. A motor at full speed acts like a dynamo, and\r\ngenerates a current which tends to flow from the machine in a direction\r\nopposite to that which produces the motion. It is evident, then, that\r\nwhen the armature is at rest, all the current turned on passes through\r\nit without meeting with this opposing current.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 235.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 236.]\r\n\r\nFig. 235 shows a starting, stopping, and regulating box, inside of\r\nwhich are a number of German-silver resistance coils properly connected\r\nto contact-points at the top. By turning the knob, the field of the\r\nmotor is immediately charged first through resistance, then direct, and\r\nthen the current is put on the armature gradually through a series of\r\ncoils, the amount of current depending upon the distance the switch is\r\nturned. Fig. 236 shows a cross section of the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nELECTRIC CARS, BOATS, AND AUTOMOBILES.\r\n\r\n\r\n=164. Electric Cars=, as well as boats, automobiles, etc., etc., are\r\nmoved by the power that comes from electric motors, these receiving\r\ncurrent from the dynamos placed at some \"central station.\" We have\r\nalready seen how the motor can do many kinds of work. By properly\r\ngearing it to the car wheels, motion can be given to them which will\r\nmove the car.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 237.]\r\n\r\nFig. 237 shows two dynamos which will be supposed to be at a power\r\nhouse and which send out a current to propel cars. From the figure\r\nit will be seen that the wires over the cars, called trolley-wires,\r\nare connected to the positive (+) terminals of the dynamos, and that\r\nthe negative (-) terminals are connected to the tracks. In case a\r\nwire were allowed to join the trolley-wire and track, we should have\r\na short circuit, and current would not only rush back to the dynamo\r\nwithout doing useful work, but it would probably injure the machines.\r\nWhen some of the current is allowed to pass through a car, motion is\r\nproduced in the motors, as has been explained. As the number of cars\r\nincreases, more current passes back to the dynamos, which must do more\r\nwork to furnish such current.\r\n\r\n_Trolley-poles_, fastened to the top of the cars and which end in\r\ngrooved wheels, called _trolley-wheels_, are pressed by springs against\r\nthe trolley-wires. The current passes down these through switches to\r\n_controllers_ at each end of the car, one set being used at a time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 238.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 239.]\r\n\r\n=165. The Controllers=, as the name suggests, control the speed of the\r\ncar by allowing more or less current to pass through the motors. The\r\nmotors, resistance coils and controllers are so connected with each\r\nother that the amount of current used can be regulated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 240.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 241.]\r\n\r\nWhen the motorman turns the handle of the controller to the first\r\nnotch, the current passes through all of the resistance wires placed\r\nunder the car, then through one motor after the other. The motors being\r\njoined in series by the proper connections at the controller, the\r\ngreatest resistance is offered to the current and the car runs at the\r\nslowest speed at this first notch. As more resistance is cut out by\r\nturning the handle to other notches, the car increases its speed; but\r\nas the resistance wires become heated and the heat passes into the air,\r\nthere is a loss of energy. It is not economical to run a car at such a\r\nspeed that energy is wasted as heat. As soon as the resistance is all\r\ncut out, the current simply passes through the motors joined in series.\r\nThis gives a fairly slow speed and one that is economical because all\r\nthe current tends to produce motion.\r\n\r\nBy allowing the current to pass through the motors joined in parallel,\r\nthat is, by allowing each to take a part of the current, the resistance\r\nis greatly reduced, and a higher speed attained. This is not instantly\r\ndone, however, as too much strain would be put upon the motors. As soon\r\nas the next notch is reached, the motors are joined in parallel and\r\nthe resistance also thrown in again. By turning the handle still more,\r\nresistance is gradually cut out, and the highest speed produced when\r\nthe current passes only through the motors in parallel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 242.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 243.]\r\n\r\nFig. 238 represents a controller, by diagram, showing the relative\r\npositions of the controller cylinder, reversing and cut-out cylinders,\r\narrangements for blowing out the short electric arcs formed, etc. A\r\nratchet and pawl is provided, which indicates positively the running\r\nnotches, at the same time permitting the cylinder to move with ease.\r\nFig. 239 shows a top view of the controller.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 244.]\r\n\r\n=166. Overhead and Underground Systems.= When wires for furnishing\r\ncurrent are placed over the tracks, as in Fig. 237, we have the\r\noverhead system. In cities the underground system is largely used.\r\nThe location of the conducting wires beneath the surface of the\r\nstreet removes all danger to the public, and protects them from all\r\ninterference, leaving the street free from poles and wires.\r\n\r\nFig. 240 shows a cross-section of an underground conduit. The rails,\r\nR R, are supported by cast-iron yokes, A, placed five feet apart, and\r\nthoroughly imbedded in concrete. The conduit has sewer connections\r\nevery 100 feet. Conducting bars, C C, are placed on each side of\r\nthe conduit, and these are divided into sections of about 500 feet.\r\nInsulators, D D, are placed every 15 feet. They are attached to, and\r\ndirectly under, the slot-rails, the stem passing through the conductor\r\nbar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 245.]\r\n\r\nFigs. 240 and 241 show the plow E. The contact plates are carried on\r\ncoiled springs to allow a free motion. Two guide-wheels, F F, are\r\nattached to the leg of the plow. The conducting wires are carried up\r\nthrough the leg of the plow.\r\n\r\n=167. Appliances.= A large number of articles are needed in the\r\nconstruction of electric railroads. A few, only, can be shown that are\r\nused for the overhead system. Fig. 242 shows a pole insulator. Fig. 243\r\nshows a feeder-wire insulator. Fig. 244 shows a line suspension. Fig.\r\n245 shows a form of right-angle cross which allows the trolley-wheels\r\nof crossing lines to pass. Fig. 246 shows a switch. In winter a part of\r\nthe current is allowed to pass through electric heaters placed under\r\nthe seats of electric cars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 246.]\r\n\r\n=168. Electric Boats= are run by the current from storage batteries\r\nwhich are usually placed under the seats. An electric motor large\r\nenough to run a small boat takes up very little room and is generally\r\nplaced under the floor. This leaves the entire boat for the use of\r\npassengers. The motor is connected to the shaft that turns the screw.\r\nFig. 247 shows one design.\r\n\r\n=169. Electric Automobiles= represent the highest type of electrical\r\nand mechanical construction. The _running-gear_ is usually made of the\r\nbest cold-drawn seamless steel tubing, to get the greatest strength\r\nfrom a given weight of material. The wheels are made in a variety of\r\nstyles, but nearly all have ball bearings and pneumatic tires. In the\r\nlightest styles the wheels have wire spokes.\r\n\r\nThe _electric motors_, supported by the running-gear, are geared to\r\nthe rear wheels. The motors are made as nearly dust-proof as possible.\r\n\r\n_Storage batteries_ are put in a convenient place, depending upon the\r\ndesign of the carriage, and from these the motors receive the current.\r\nThese can be charged from the ordinary 110-volt lighting circuits or\r\nfrom private dynamos. The proper plugs and attachments are usually\r\nfurnished by the various makers for connecting the batteries with the\r\nstreet current, which is shut off when the batteries are full by an\r\nautomatic switch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 247.]\r\n\r\n_Controllers_ are used, as on electric cars, the lever for starting,\r\nstopping, etc., being usually placed on the left-hand side of the seat.\r\nThe _steering_ is done by a lever that moves the front wheels. Strong\r\nbrakes, and the ability to quickly reverse the motors, allow electric\r\ncarriages to be stopped suddenly in case of accidents.\r\n\r\nElectric automobiles are largely used in cities, or where the current\r\ncan be easily had. The batteries must be re-charged after they have\r\nrun the motors for a certain time which depends upon the speed and\r\nroad, as well as upon the construction. Where carriages are to be run\r\nalmost constantly, as is the case with those used for general passenger\r\nservice in cities, duplicate batteries are necessary, so that one or\r\ntwo sets can be charged while another is in use. Fig. 248 shows one\r\nform of electric vehicle, the storage batteries being placed under and\r\nback of the seat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 248.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nA WORD ABOUT CENTRAL STATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=170. Central Stations=, as the word implies, are places where, for\r\nexample, electricity is generated for the incandescent or arc lights\r\nused in a certain neighborhood; where telephone or telegraph messages\r\nare sent to be resent to some other station; where operators are kept\r\nto switch different lines together, so that those on one line can\r\ntalk to those on another, etc., etc. There are many kinds of central\r\nstations, each requiring a large amount of special apparatus to carry\r\non the work. Fig. 249 gives a hint in regard to the way car lines\r\nget their power from a central power station. As a large part of the\r\napparatus required in ordinary central stations has already been\r\ndescribed, it is not necessary to go into the details of such stations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 249.]\r\n\r\nIn lighting stations, for example, we have three principal kinds of\r\napparatus. Boilers produce the steam that runs the steam engines, and\r\nthese run the dynamos that give the current. Besides these there are\r\nmany other things needed. The electrical energy that goes over the\r\nwires to furnish light, heat, and power, really comes indirectly from\r\nthe coal that is used to boil water and convert it into steam. The\r\nvarious parts of the central station merely aid in this transformation\r\nof energy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 250.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 251.]\r\n\r\nThe dynamos are connected to the engines by belts, or they are direct\r\nconnected. Figs. 250, 251, show dynamos connected to engines without\r\nbelts.\r\n\r\nThe current from the dynamos is led to large switchboards which contain\r\nswitches, voltmeters, ammeters, lightning arresters, and various other\r\napparatus for the proper control and measurement of the current. From\r\nthe switchboard it is allowed to pass through the various street mains,\r\nfrom which it is finally led to lamps, motors, etc.\r\n\r\nWater-power is frequently used to drive the dynamos instead of steam\r\nengines. The water turns some form of water-wheel which is connected\r\nto the dynamos. At Niagara Falls, for example, immense quantities of\r\ncurrent are generated for light, heat, power, and industrial purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS USES OF ELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n=171. The Many Uses= to which the electric current is put are almost\r\nnumberless. New uses are being found for it every day. Some of the\r\ncommon applications are given below.\r\n\r\n=172. Automatic Electric Program Clocks=, Fig. 252, are largely used\r\nin all sorts of establishments, schools, etc., for ringing bells at\r\ncertain stated periods. The lower dial shown has many contact-points\r\nthat can be inserted to correspond to given times. As this revolves,\r\nthe circuits are closed, one after the other, and it may be so set that\r\nbells will be rung in different parts of the house every five minutes,\r\nif desired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 252.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 253.]\r\n\r\n=173. Call Boxes= are used to send in calls of various kinds to\r\ncentral stations. Fig. 253 shows one form. The number of different\r\ncalls provided includes messenger, carrier, coupé, express wagon,\r\ndoctor, laborer, police, fire, together with three more, which may be\r\nmade special to suit the convenience of the individual customer. The\r\ninstruments are provided with apparatus for receiving a return signal,\r\nthe object of which is to notify the subscriber that his call has been\r\nreceived and is having attention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 254.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 255.]\r\n\r\nFig. 254 shows another form of call box, the handle being moved around\r\nto the call desired. As it springs back to the original position, an\r\ninterrupted current passes through the box to the central station,\r\ncausing a bell to tap a certain number of times, giving the call and\r\nlocation of the box.\r\n\r\n=174. Electric Gas-Lighters.= Fig. 255 shows a _ratchet burner_. The\r\nfirst pull of the chain turns on the gas through a four-way gas-cock,\r\ngoverned by a ratchet-wheel and pawl. The issuing gas is lighted by a\r\nwipe-spark at the tip of the burner. Alternate pulls shut off the gas.\r\nAs the lever brings the attached wire A, in contact with the wire B,\r\na bright spark passes, which ignites the gas, the burner being joined\r\nwith a battery and induction or spark coil.\r\n\r\n_Automatic burners_ are used when it is desired to light gas at\r\na distance from the push-button. Fig. 256 shows one form. Two\r\nelectromagnets are shown, one being generally joined to a white\r\npush-button for turning on the gas and lighting it, the other being\r\njoined to a black button which turns off the gas when it is pressed.\r\nThe armatures of the magnets work the gas-valve. Sparks ignite the gas,\r\nas explained above.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 256.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 257.]\r\n\r\n=175. Door Openers.= Fig. 257 shows one form. They contain\r\nelectromagnets so arranged that when the armature is attracted by the\r\npushing of a button anywhere in the building, the door can be pushed\r\nopen.\r\n\r\n=176. Dental Outfits.= Fig. 258 shows a motor arranged to run dental\r\napparatus. The motor can be connected to an ordinary incandescent light\r\nsocket. In case the current gives out, the drills, etc., can be run by\r\nfoot power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 258.]\r\n\r\n=177. Annunciators= of various kinds are used in hotels, factories,\r\netc., to indicate a certain room when a bell rings at the office.\r\nThe bell indicates that some one has called, and the annunciator\r\nshows the location of the call by displaying the number of the room\r\nor its location. Fig. 259 shows a small annunciator. They contain\r\nelectromagnets which are connected to push-buttons located in the\r\nbuilding, and which bring the numbers into place as soon as the current\r\npasses through them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 259.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nNumbers refer to paragraphs.

It is\r\nfull of explicit details and instructions in regard to a great\r\nvariety of apparatus, and the materials required are all within the\r\ncompass of very modest pocket-money. Moreover, it is systematic and\r\nentirely without rhetorical frills, so that the student can go right\r\nalong without being diverted from good helpful work that will lead\r\nhim to build useful apparatus and make him understand what he is\r\nabout. The drawings are plain and excellent. We heartily commend the\r\nbook.\"--_Electrical Engineer._\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Those who visited the electrical exhibition last May cannot have\r\nfailed to notice on the south gallery a very interesting exhibit,\r\nconsisting, as it did, of electrical apparatus made by boys. The\r\nvarious devices there shown, comprising electro-magnets, telegraph keys\r\nand sounders, resistance coils, etc., were turned out by boys following\r\nthe instructions given in the book with the above title, which is\r\nunquestionably one of the most practical little works yet written that\r\ntreat of similar subjects, for with but a limited amount of mechanical\r\nknowledge, and by closely following the instructions given, almost any\r\nelectrical device may be made at very small expense. That such a book\r\nfills a long-felt want may be inferred from the number of inquiries\r\nwe are constantly receiving from persons desiring to make their own\r\ninduction coils and other apparatus.\"--_Electricity._\r\n\r\n\r\n\"At the electrical show in New York last May one of the most\r\ninteresting exhibits was that of simple electrical apparatus made by\r\nthe boys in one of the private schools in the city. This apparatus,\r\nmade by boys of thirteen to fifteen years of age, was from designs\r\nby the author of this clever little book, and it was remarkable to\r\nsee what an ingenious use had been made of old tin tomato-cans,\r\ncracker-boxes, bolts, screws, wire, and wood. With these simple\r\nmaterials telegraph instruments, coils, buzzers, current detectors,\r\nmotors, switches, armatures, and an almost endless variety of apparatus\r\nwere made, In this book Mr. St. John has given directions in simple\r\nlanguage for making and using these devices, and has illustrated\r\nthese directions with admirable diagrams and cuts. The little volume\r\nis unique, and will prove exceedingly helpful to those of our young\r\nreaders who are fortunate enough to possess themselves of a copy. For\r\nschools where a course of elementary science is taught, no better\r\ntext-book in the first-steps in electricity is obtainable.\"--_The Great\r\nRound World._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExhibit of Experimental Electrical Apparatus\r\n\r\nAT THE ELECTRICAL SHOW, MADISON SQUARE GARDEN, NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile only 40 pieces of simple apparatus were shown in this exhibit, it\r\ngave visitors something of an idea of what young boys can do if given\r\nproper designs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"HOW TWO BOYS MADE THEIR OWN ELECTRICAL APPARATUS\"\r\n\r\nGives Proper Designs--Designs for over 150 Things.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFun With Photography\r\n\r\nBOOK AND COMPLETE OUTFIT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n=PHOTOGRAPHY= is now an educational amusement, and to many it is the\r\nmost fascinating of all amusements.

After making and experimenting\r\nwith nearly one hundred models, many of which were good, he has at last\r\nperfected an instrument so simple, original, and effective that it is\r\nnow being made in large quantities.\r\n\r\nThe sounders are so designed that they will work properly with any dry\r\ncell of ordinary strength, and this is a great advantage for practice\r\nlines. Dry batteries are cheap and clean, and there are no dangers from\r\nacids.\r\n\r\nThe outfit consists of the following articles, placed in a neat box:\r\nOne Book of Instruction, called \"Fun With Telegraphy\"; one Telegraph\r\n\"Key\"; one Telegraph \"Sounder\"; Insulated Copper Wires for connections.\r\nThe \"key\" and \"sounder\" are mounted, with proper \"binding-posts,\" upon\r\na base of peculiar construction, which aids in giving a large volume of\r\nsound.\r\n\r\n\r\n=CONTENTS OF BOOK.=--Telegraphy.--The Outfit.--A Complete Telegraph\r\nLine.--Connections.--The Telegraph Key.--The Sounder.--The Battery.--A\r\nPractice Line.--A Two-instrument Line.--Operation of Line.--The Morse\r\nTelegraph Alphabet.--Aids to Learning Alphabet.--Cautions.--Office\r\nCalls.--Receiving Messages.--Remember.--Extra Parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n=ABOUT BATTERIES.=--For those who cannot easily secure batteries, we\r\nwill furnish small dry cells, post-paid, at 15 cents each, in order to\r\ndeliver the outfits complete to our customers. This price barely covers\r\nthe total cost to us, postage alone being 6 cents.\r\n\r\n    _=FUN WITH TELEGRAPHY, including Book, Key, Sounder,\r\n    and Wire (no battery), post-paid, 50 cents, by=_\r\n\r\n    =THOMAS M.

Various Aids to Construction.\r\n\r\nWhile planning this book, Mr. St. John definitely decided that he would\r\nnot fill it with descriptions of complicated, machine-made instruments\r\nand apparatus, under the name of \"Toy-Making,\" for it is just as\r\nimpossible for most boys to get the parts for such things as it is\r\nfor them to do the required machine work even after they have the raw\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nGreat care has been taken in designing the toys which are described\r\nin this book, in order to make them so simple that any boy of average\r\nability can construct them out of ordinary materials. The author can\r\npersonally guarantee the designs, for there is no guesswork about\r\nthem. Every toy was made, changed, and experimented with until it was\r\nas simple as possible; the drawings were then made from the perfected\r\nmodels.\r\n\r\nAs the result of the enormous amount of work and experimenting which\r\nwere required to originate and perfect so many new models, the author\r\nfeels that this book may be truly called \"Real Electric Toy-Making for\r\nBoys.\"\r\n\r\n    =Every Boy Should Make Electrical Toys.=\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Electric Shooting Game>\r\n\r\nA MOST ORIGINAL AND FASCINATING GAME PATENT APPLIED FOR AND COPYRIGHTED\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_=SHOOTING BY ELECTRICITY=_\r\n\r\n=The Electric Shooting Game= is an entirely new idea, and one that\r\nbrings into use that most mysterious something--_electricity_. The\r\ngame is so simple that small children can play it, and as there are\r\nno batteries, acids, or liquids of any kind, there is absolutely no\r\ndanger. The electricity is of such a nature that it is perfectly\r\nharmless--but very active.\r\n\r\nThe \"_game-preserve_\" is neat and attractive, being printed in colors,\r\nand the birds and animals are well worth hunting. Each has a fixed\r\nvalue--and some of them must not be shot at all--so there is ample\r\nopportunity for a display of skill in bringing down those which count\r\nmost.\r\n\r\n\"_Electric bullets_\" are actually shot from the \"_electric gun_\" by\r\nelectricity. This instructive game will furnish a vast amount of\r\namusement to all.\r\n\r\n _=The \"Game-Preserve,\"--the \"Electric Gun,\"--the\r\n    \"Shooting-Box,\"--the \"Electric Bullets,\"--in fact, the\r\n    entire electrical outfit, together with complete illustrated\r\n    directions, will be sent in a neat box, Post-Paid, upon\r\n    receipt of 50 cents, by=_\r\n\r\n    =THOMAS M.
