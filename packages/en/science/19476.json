He took them down from his eyes, rubbed the two object-glasses\r\nwith the cuff of his coat, and looked again. The sun was shining through\r\na haze which so far dimmed the solar disc that it was possible to look\r\nstraight at it without inconvenience to the eyes.\r\n\r\nThe officer took another long squint, put his glasses down, rubbed his\r\neyes and took another, and murmured, \"Well I'm damned!\"\r\n\r\nJust then the Fourth Officer came up on to the bridge to relieve his\r\nsenior while he went down for a cup of coffee and a biscuit. The Second\r\ntook him away to the other end of the bridge, out of hearing of the\r\nhelmsman and the quartermaster standing by, and said almost in a\r\nwhisper:\r\n\r\n\"Say, Norton, there's something ahead there that I can't make out. Just\r\nas the sun got clear above the horizon I saw a black spot go straight\r\nacross it, right through the upper and lower limbs. I looked again, and\r\nit was plumb in the middle of the disc. Look,\" he went on, speaking\r\nlouder in his growing excitement, \"there it is again! I can see it\r\nwithout the glasses now. See?\"\r\n\r\nThe Fourth did not reply at once. He had the glasses close to his eyes,\r\nand was moving them slowly about as though he were following some\r\nshifting object in the sky. Then he handed them back, and said:\r\n\r\n\"If I didn't believe the thing was impossible I should say that's an\r\nair-ship; but, for the present, I guess I'd rather wait till it gets a\r\nbit nearer, if it's coming. Still, there _is_ something. Seems to be\r\ngetting bigger pretty fast, too. Perhaps it would be as well to notify\r\nthe old man. What do you think?\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess we'd better,\" said the Second. \"S'pose you go down. Don't say\r\nanything except to him. We don't want any more excitement among the\r\npeople than we can help.\"\r\n\r\nThe Fourth nodded and went down the steps, and the Second began walking\r\nup and down the bridge, every now and then taking another squint ahead.\r\nAgain and again the mysterious shape crossed the disc of the sun, always\r\nvertically as though, whatever it might be, it was steering a direct\r\ncourse from the sun to the ship, its apparent rising and falling being\r\ndue really to the dipping of her bows into the swells.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Charteris, what's the trouble?\" said the Skipper as he\r\nreached the bridge. \"Nothing wrong, I hope? Have you sighted a derelict,\r\nor what? Ay, what in hell's that!\"\r\n\r\nHis hands went up to his eyes and he stared for a few moments at the\r\npale yellow oblate shape of the sun.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the _St. Louis'_ head dipped again, and the Captain saw\r\nsomething like a black line swiftly drawn across the sun from bottom to\r\ntop.\r\n\r\n\"That's what I wanted to call your attention to, sir,\" said the Second\r\nin a low tone. \"I first noticed it crossing the sun as it rose through\r\nthe mist. I thought it was a spot of dirt on my glasses, but it has\r\ncrossed the sun several times since then, and for some minutes seemed to\r\nremain dead in the middle of it. Later on it got quite a lot larger, and\r\nwhatever it is it's approaching us pretty rapidly. You see it's quite\r\nplain to the naked eye now.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time several of the crew and of the early loungers on deck had\r\nalso caught sight of the strange thing which seemed to be hanging and\r\nswinging between the sky and the sea. People dived below for their\r\nglasses, knocked at their friends' state-room doors and told them to get\r\nup because something was flying towards the ship through the air; and in\r\na very few minutes there were hundreds of passengers on deck in all\r\nvarieties of early morning costume, and scores of glasses, held to\r\nanxious eyes, were being directed ahead.\r\n\r\nThe glasses, however, soon became unnecessary, for the passengers had\r\nscarcely got up on deck before the mysterious object to the eastward at\r\nlength took definite shape, and as it did so mouths were opened as well\r\nas eyes, for the owners of the eyes and mouths beheld just then the\r\nstrangest sight that travellers by sea or land had ever seen.\r\n\r\nWithin the distance of about a mile it swung round at right angles to\r\nthe steamer's course with a rapidity which plainly showed that it was\r\nentirely obedient to the control of a guiding intelligence, and hundreds\r\nof eager eyes on board the liner saw, sweeping down from the grey-blue\r\nof the early morning sky, a vessel whose hull seemed to be constructed\r\nof some metal which shone with a pale, steely lustre.\r\n\r\nIt was pointed at both ends, the forward end being shaped something like\r\na spur or ram. At the after end were two flickering, interlacing circles\r\nof a glittering greenish-yellow colour, apparently formed by two\r\nintersecting propellers driven at an enormous velocity. Behind these was\r\na vertical fan of triangular shape. The craft appeared to be\r\nflat-bottomed, and for about a third of her length amidships the upper\r\nhalf of her hull was covered with a curving, domelike roof of glass.\r\n\r\n\"She's an air-ship of some sort, there's no doubt about that,\" said the\r\nCaptain, \"so I guess the great problem has got solved at last. And yet\r\nit ain't a balloon, because it's coming against the wind, and it's\r\nnothing of the æroplane sort neither, because it hasn't planes or kites\r\nor any fixings of that kind. Still it's made of something like metal and\r\nglass, and it must take a lot of keeping up. It's travelling at a pretty\r\nhealthy speed too. Getting on for a hundred miles an hour, I should\r\nguess. Ah! he's going to speak us! Hope he's honest.\"\r\n\r\nEverybody on board the _St. Louis_ was up on deck by this time, and the\r\nexcitement rose to fever-heat as the strange vessel swept down towards\r\nthem from the middle sky, passed them like a flash of light, swung round\r\nthe stern, and ranged up alongside to starboard some twenty feet from\r\nthe bridge rail.\r\n\r\nShe was about a hundred and twenty feet long, with some twenty feet of\r\ndepth and thirty of beam, and the Captain and many of his officers and\r\npassengers were very much relieved to find that, as far as could be\r\nseen, she carried no weapons of offence.\r\n\r\nAs she ranged up alongside, a sliding door opened in the glass-domed\r\nroof amidships, just opposite to the end of the _St. Louis'_ bridge. A\r\ntall, fair-haired, clean-featured man, of about thirty, in grey\r\nflannels, tipped up his golf cap with his thumb, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Captain! You remember me, I suppose? Had a fine passage,\r\nso far? I thought I should meet you somewhere about here.\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain of the _St. Louis_, in common with every one else on board,\r\nhad already had his credulity stretched about as far as it would go, and\r\nhe was beginning to wonder whether he was really awake; but when he\r\nheard the hail and recognised the speaker he stared at him in blank and,\r\nfor the moment, speechless bewilderment. Then he got hold of his voice\r\nagain and said, keeping as steady as he could:\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, my Lord! Guess I never expected to meet even you like\r\nthis in the middle of the Atlantic! So the newspaper men were right for\r\nonce in a way, and you _have_ got an air-ship that will fly?\"\r\n\r\n\"And a good deal more than that, Captain, if she wants to. I am just\r\ntaking a trial trip across the Atlantic before I start on a run round\r\nthe Solar System. Sounds like a lie, doesn't it? But it's coming off.\r\nOh, good morning, Miss Rennick! Captain, may I come on board?\"\r\n\r\n\"By all means, my Lord, only I'm afraid I daren't stop Uncle Sam's\r\nmails, even for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no need for that, Captain, on a smooth sea like this,\" was the\r\nreply. \"Just keep on as you are going and I'll come alongside.\"\r\n\r\nHe put his head inside the door and called something up a speaking-tube\r\nwhich led to a glass-walled chamber in the forward part of the roof,\r\nwhere a motionless figure stood before a little steering wheel.\r\n\r\nThe craft immediately began to edge nearer and nearer to the liner's\r\nrail, keeping speed so exactly with her that the threshold of the door\r\ntouched the end of the bridge without a perceptible jar. Then the\r\nflannel-clad figure jumped on to the bridge and held out his hand to the\r\nCaptain.\r\n\r\nAs they shook hands he said in a low tone, \"I want a word or two in\r\nprivate with you, as soon as possible.\"\r\n\r\nThe commander saw a very serious meaning in his eyes. Besides, even if\r\nhe had not made his appearance under such extraordinary circumstances,\r\nit was quite impossible that one of his social position and his wealth\r\nand influence could have made such a request without good reason for it,\r\nso he replied:\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, my Lord. Will you come down to my room?\"\r\n\r\nHundreds of anxious, curious eyes looked upon the tall athletic figure\r\nand the regular-featured, bronzed, honest English face as Rollo Lenox\r\nSmeaton Aubrey, Earl of Redgrave, Baron Smeaton in the Peerage of\r\nEngland, and Viscount Aubrey in the Peerage of Ireland, followed the\r\nCaptain to his room through the parting crowd of passengers. He nodded\r\nto one or two familiar faces in the crowd, for he was an old Atlantic\r\nferryman, and had crossed five times with Captain Hawkins in the _St.\r\nLouis_.\r\n\r\nThen he caught sight of a well and fondly remembered face which he had\r\nnot seen for over two years. It was a face which possessed at once the\r\nfair Anglo-Saxon skin, the firm and yet delicate Anglo-Saxon features,\r\nand the wavy wealth of the old Saxon gold-brown hair; but a pair of big,\r\nsoft, pansy eyes, fringed with long, curling, black lashes, looked out\r\nfrom under dark and perhaps just a trifle heavy eyebrows. Moreover,\r\nthere was that indescribable expression in the curve of her lips and the\r\npose of her head; to say nothing of a lissome, vivacious grace in her\r\nwhole carriage which proclaimed her a daughter of the younger branch of\r\nthe Race that Rules.\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met for an instant, and Lord Redgrave was startled and even a\r\ntrifle angered to see that she flushed up quickly, and that the\r\nmomentary smile with which she greeted him died away as she turned her\r\nhead aside. Still, he was a man accustomed to do what he wanted: and\r\nwhat he wanted to do just then was to shake hands with Lilla Zaidie\r\nRennick, and so he went straight towards her, raised his cap, and held\r\nout his hand saying, first with a glance into her eyes, and then with\r\none upward at the _Astronef_:\r\n\r\n\"Good morning again, Miss Rennick! You see it is done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Lord Redgrave!\" she replied, he thought, a little\r\nawkwardly. \"Yes, I see you have kept your promise. What a pity it is too\r\nlate! But I hope you will be able to stop long enough to tell us all\r\nabout it. This is Mrs. Van Stuyler, who has taken me under her\r\nprotection on my journey to Europe.\"\r\n\r\nHis lordship returned the bow of a tall, somewhat hard-featured matron\r\nwho looked dignified even in the somewhat nondescript costume which most\r\nof the ladies were wearing. But her eyes were kindly, and he said:\r\n\r\n\"Very pleased to meet, Mrs. Van Stuyler. I heard you were coming, and I\r\nwas in hopes of catching you on the other side before you left. And now,\r\nif you will excuse me, I must go and have a chat with the Skipper.\" He\r\nraised his cap again and presently vanished from the curious eyes of the\r\nexcited crowd, through the door of the Captain's apartment.\r\n\r\nCaptain Hawkins closed the door of his sitting-room as he entered, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Now, my Lord, I'm not going to ask you any questions to begin with,\r\nbecause if I once began I should never stop; and besides, perhaps you'd\r\nlike to have your own say right away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps that will be the shortest way,\" said his lordship. \"The fact\r\nis, we've not only the remains of this Boer business on our hands, but\r\nwe've had what is practically a declaration of war from France and\r\nRussia. Briefly it's this way. A few weeks ago, while the Allies thought\r\nthey were fighting the Boxers, it came to the knowledge of my brother,\r\nthe Foreign Secretary, that the Tsung-li-Yamen had concluded a secret\r\ntreaty with Russia which practically annulled all our rights over the\r\nYang-tse Valley, and gave Russia the right to bring her Northern Railway\r\nright down through China.\r\n\r\n\"As you know, we've stood a lot too much in that part of the world\r\nalready, but we couldn't stand this; so about ten days ago an ultimatum\r\nwas sent declaring that the British Government would consider any\r\nencroachment on the Yang-tse Valley as an unfriendly act.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile France chipped in with a notification that she was going to\r\noccupy Morocco as a compensation for Fashoda, and added a few nasty\r\nthings about Egypt and other places. Of course we couldn't stand that\r\neither, so there was another ultimatum, and the upshot of it all was\r\nthat I got a wire late last night from my brother telling me that war\r\nwould almost certainly be declared to-day, and asking me for the use of\r\nthis craft of mine as a sort of dispatch-boat if she was ready. She is\r\nintended for something very much better than fighting purposes, so he\r\ncouldn't ask me to use her as a war-ship; besides, I am under a solemn\r\nobligation to her inventor--her creator, in fact, for I've only built\r\nher--to blow her to pieces rather than allow her to be used as a\r\nfighting machine except, of course, in sheer personal self-defence.\r\n\r\n\"There is the telegram from my brother, so you can see there's no\r\nmistake, and just after it came a messenger asking me, if the machine\r\nwas a success, to bring this with me across the Atlantic as fast as I\r\ncould come. It is the duplicate of an offensive and defensive alliance\r\nbetween Great Britain and the United States, of which the details had\r\nbeen arranged just as this complication arose. Another is coming across\r\nby a fast cruiser, and, of course, the news will have got to Washington\r\nby cable by this time.\r\n\r\n\"By the time you get to the entrance of the Channel you will probably\r\nfind it swarming with French cruisers and torpedo-destroyers, so if\r\nyou'll be advised by me, you'll leave Queenstown out and get as far\r\nnorth as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord Redgrave,\" said the Captain, putting out his hand, \"I'm\r\nresponsible for a good bit right here, and I don't know how to thank you\r\nenough. I guess that treaty's been given away back to France by some of\r\nour Irish statesmen by now, and it'd be mighty unhealthy for the _St.\r\nLouis_ to fall in with a French or Russian cruiser----\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right, Captain,\" said Lord Redgrave, taking his hand. \"I\r\nshould have warned any other British or American ship. At the same time,\r\nI must confess that my motives in warning you were not entirely\r\nunselfish. The fact is, there's some one on board the _St. Louis_ whom I\r\nshould decidedly object to see taken off to France as a prisoner of\r\nwar.\"\r\n\r\n\"And may I ask who that is?\" said Captain Hawkins.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" replied his lordship. \"It's the young lady I spoke to on deck\r\njust now, Miss Rennick. Her father was the inventor of that craft of\r\nmine. No one would believe his theories. He was refused patents both in\r\nEngland and America on the ground of lack of practical utility. I met\r\nhim about two years ago, that is to say rather more than a year before\r\nhis death, when I was stopping at Banff up in the Canadian Rockies. We\r\nmade a travellers' acquaintance, and he told me about this idea of his.\r\nI was very much interested, but I'm afraid I must confess that I might\r\nnot have taken it up practically if the Professor hadn't happened to\r\npossess an exceedingly beautiful daughter. However, of course I'm pretty\r\nglad now that I did do it; though the experiments cost nearly five\r\nthousand pounds and the craft herself close on a quarter of a million.\r\nStill, she is worth every penny of it, and I was bringing her over to\r\noffer to Miss Rennick as a wedding present, that is to say if she'd have\r\nit--and me.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Hawkins looked up and said rather seriously:\r\n\r\n\"Then, my Lord, I presume you don't know----\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't know what?\"\r\n\r\n\"That Miss Rennick is crossing in the care of Mrs. Van Stuyler, to be\r\nmarried in London next month.\"\r\n\r\n\"The devil she is! And to whom, may I ask?\" exclaimed his lordship,\r\npulling himself up very straight.\r\n\r\n\"To the Marquis of Byfleet, son of the Duke of Duncaster. I wonder you\r\ndidn't hear of it. The match was arranged last fall. From what people\r\nsay she's not very desperately in love with him, but--well, I fancy it's\r\nlike rather too many of these Anglo-American matches. A couple of\r\nmillion dollars on one side, a title on the other, and mighty little\r\nreal love between them.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Redgrave between his teeth, \"I didn't understand that Miss\r\nRennick ever had a fortune; in fact I'm quite certain that if her father\r\nhad been a rich man he'd have worked out his invention himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the dollars aren't his. In fact they won't be hers till she\r\nmarries,\" replied the Captain. \"They belong to her uncle, old Russell\r\nRennick. He got in on the ground floor of the New York and Chicago ice\r\ntrusts, and made millions. He's going to spend some of them on making\r\nhis niece a Marchioness. That's about all there is to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said Redgrave, still between his teeth. \"Well, considering\r\nthat Byfleet is about as big a wastrel as ever disgraced the English\r\naristocracy, I don't think either Miss Rennick or her uncle will make a\r\nvery good bargain. However, of course that's no affair of mine now. I\r\nremember that this Russell Rennick refused to finance his brother when\r\nhe really wanted the money. He made a particularly bad bargain, too,\r\nthen, though he didn't know it; for a dozen crafts like that, properly\r\narmed, would simply smash up the navies of the world, and make sea-power\r\na private trust. After all, I'm not particularly sorry, because then it\r\nwouldn't have belonged to me. Well now, Captain, I'm going to ask you to\r\ngive me a bit of breakfast when it's ready, and then I must be off. I\r\nwant to be in Washington to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-night! What, twenty-one hundred miles!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" said Redgrave; \"I can do about a hundred and fifty an hour\r\nthrough the atmosphere, and then, you see, if that isn't fast enough I\r\ncan rise outside the earth's attraction, let it spin round, and then\r\ncome down where I want to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great Scott!\" remarked Captain Hawkins inadequately, but with emphasis.\r\n\"Well, my Lord, I guess we'll go down to breakfast.\"\r\n\r\nBut breakfast was not quite ready, and so Lord Redgrave rejoined Miss\r\nRennick and her chaperon on deck. All eyes and a good many glasses were\r\nstill turned on the _Astronef_, which had now moved a few feet away from\r\nthe liner's side, and was running along, exactly keeping pace with her.\r\n\r\n\"It's so wonderful, that even seeing doesn't seem believing,\" said the\r\ngirl, when they had renewed their acquaintance of two years before.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he replied, \"it would be very easy to convince you. She shall\r\ncome alongside again, and if you and Mrs. Van Stuyler will honour her by\r\nyour presence for half an hour while breakfast is getting ready, I think\r\nI shall be able to convince you that she is not the airy fabric of a\r\nvision, but simply the realisation in metal and glass and other things\r\nof visions which your father saw some years ago.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no resisting an invitation put in such a way. Besides, the\r\nprospect of becoming the wonder and envy of every other woman on board\r\nwas altogether too dazzling for words.\r\n\r\nMrs. Van Stuyler looked a little aghast at the idea at first, but she\r\ntoo had something of the same feeling as Zaidie, and besides, there\r\ncould hardly be any impropriety in accepting the invitation of one of\r\nthe wealthiest and most distinguished noblemen in the British Peerage.\r\nSo, after a little demur and a slight manifestation of nervousness, she\r\nconsented.\r\n\r\nRedgrave signalled to the man at the steering wheel. The _Astronef_\r\nslackened pace a little, dropped a yard or so, and slid up quite close\r\nto the bridge-rail again. Lord Redgrave got in first and ran a light\r\ngangway down on to the bridge. Zaidie and Mrs. Van Stuyler were\r\ncarefully handed up. The next moment the gangway was drawn up again, the\r\nsliding glass doors clashed to, the _Astronef_ leapt a couple of\r\nthousand feet into the air, swept round to the westward in a magnificent\r\ncurve, and vanished into the gloom of the upper mists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nThe situation was one which was absolutely without parallel in all the\r\nhistory of courtship from the days of Mother Eve to those of Miss Lilla\r\nZaidie Rennick. The nearest approach to it would have been the\r\nold-fashioned Tartar custom which made it lawful for a man to steal his\r\nbest girl, if he could get her first, fling her across his horse's\r\ncrupper and ride away with her to his tent.\r\n\r\nBut to the shocked senses of Mrs. Van Stuyler the present adventure\r\nappeared a great deal more terrible than that. Both Zaidie and herself\r\nhad sprung to their feet as soon as the upward rush of the _Astronef_\r\nhad slackened and they were released from their seats. They looked down\r\nthrough the glass walls of what may be called the hurricane deck-chamber\r\nof the _Astronef_, and saw below them a snowy sea of clouds just\r\ncrimsoned by the rising sun.\r\n\r\nIn this cloud-sea, which spread like a wide-meshed veil between them and\r\nthe earth, there were great irregular rifts which looked as big as\r\ncontinents on a map. These had a blue-grey background, or it might be\r\nmore correct to say under-ground, and in the midst of one of these they\r\nsaw a little black speck which after a moment or two took the shape of a\r\nlittle toy ship, and presently they recognised it as the\r\neleven-thousand-ton liner which a few moments ago had been their ocean\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nMrs. Van Stuyler was shaking in every muscle, afflicted by a sort of St.\r\nVitus' dance induced by physical fear and outraged propriety. Quite\r\napart from these, however, she experienced a third sensation which made\r\nfor a nameless inquietude. She was a woman of the world, well versed in\r\nmost of its ways, and she fully recognised that that single bound from\r\nthe bridge-rail of the _St. Louis_ to the other side of the clouds had\r\nalready carried her and her charge beyond the pale of human law.\r\n\r\nThe same thought, mingled with other feelings, half of wonder and half\r\nof re-awakened tenderness, was just then uppermost in Miss Zaidie's\r\nmind. It was quite obvious that the man who could create and control\r\nsuch a marvellous vehicle as this could, morally as well as physically,\r\nlift himself beyond the reach of the conventions which civilised society\r\nhad instituted for its own protection and government.\r\n\r\nHe could do with them exactly as he pleased. They were utterly at his\r\nmercy. He might carry them away to some unexplored spot on one of the\r\ncontinents, or to some unknown island in the midst of the wide Pacific.\r\nHe might even transport them into the midst of the awful solitudes which\r\nsurround the Poles. He could give them the choice between doing as he\r\nwished, submitting unconditionally to his will, or committing suicide by\r\nstarvation.\r\n\r\nThey had not even the option of jumping out, for they did not know how\r\nto open the sliding doors; and even if they had done, what feminine\r\nnerves could have faced a leap into that awful gulf which lay below\r\nthem, a two-thousand-foot dive through the clouds into the waters of the\r\nwintry Atlantic?\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other in speechless, dazed amazement. Far away below\r\nthem on the other side of the clouds the _St. Louis_ was steaming\r\neastward, and with her were going the last hopes of the coronet which\r\nwas to be the matrimonial equivalent of Miss Zaidie's beauty and Russell\r\nRennick's millions.\r\n\r\nThey were no longer of the world. Its laws could no longer protect them.\r\nAnything might happen, and that anything depended absolutely on the will\r\nof the lord and master of the extraordinary vessel which, for the\r\npresent, was their only world.\r\n\r\n\"My dearest Zaidie,\" Mrs. Van Stuyler gasped, when she at length\r\nrecovered the power of articulate speech, \"what an entirely too awful\r\nthing this is! Why, it's abduction and nothing less. Indeed it's worse,\r\nfor he's taken us clean off the earth, and there's no more chance of\r\nrescue than if he took us to one of those planets he said he could go\r\nto. If I didn't feel a great responsibility for you, dear, I believe I\r\nshould faint.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time Miss Zaidie had recovered a good deal of her usual\r\ncomposure. The excitement of the upward rush, and what was left of the\r\nmomentary physical fear, had flushed her cheeks and lighted her eyes.\r\nEven Mrs. Van Stuyler thought her looking, if possible, more beautiful\r\nthan she had done under the most favourable of terrestrial\r\ncircumstances. There was a something else too, which she didn't\r\naltogether like to see, a sort of resignation to her fate which, in a\r\nyoung lady situated as she was then, Mrs. Van Stuyler considered to be\r\ndistinctly improper.\r\n\r\n\"It is rather startling, isn't it?\" she said, with hardly a trace of\r\nemotion in her voice; \"but I have no doubt that everything will be all\r\nright in the end.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything all right, my dear Zaidie! What on earth, or I might say\r\nunder heaven, do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean,\" replied Zaidie even more composedly than before, and also with\r\na little tightening of her lips, \"that Lord Redgrave is the owner of\r\nthis vessel, and that therefore it is quite impossible that anything out\r\nof the way could happen to us--I mean anything more out of the way than\r\nthis wonderful jump from the sea to the sky has been, unless, of course,\r\nLord Redgrave is going to take us for a voyage among the stars.\"\r\n\r\n\"Zaidie Rennick!\" said Mrs. Van Stuyler, bridling up into her most\r\nfrigid dignity, \"I am more than surprised to hear you talk in such a\r\nstrain. Perfectly safe, indeed! Has it not struck you that we are\r\nabsolutely at this man's--this Lord Redgrave's, mercy, that he can take\r\nus where he likes, and treat us just as he pleases?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Mrs. Van,\" replied Zaidie, dropping back into her familiar form\r\nof address, but speaking even more frigidly than her chaperon had done,\r\n\"you seem to forget that, however extraordinary our situation may be\r\njust now, we are in the care of an English gentleman. Lord Redgrave was\r\na friend of my father's, the only man who believed in his ideals, the\r\nonly man who realised them, the only man----\"\r\n\r\n\"That you were ever in love with, eh?\" said Mrs. Van Stuyler with a snap\r\nin her voice. \"Is that so? Ah, I begin to see something now.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I think, if you possess your soul in patience, you will see\r\nsomething more before long,\" snapped Miss Zaidie in reply. Then she\r\nstopped abruptly and the flush on her cheek deepened, for at that moment\r\nLord Redgrave came up the companion way from the lower deck carrying a\r\nbig silver tray with a coffee pot, three cups and saucers, a rack of\r\ntoast, and a couple of plates of bread and butter and cake.\r\n\r\nJust then a sort of social miracle happened. The fact was that Mrs. Van\r\nStuyler had never before had her early coffee brought to her by a peer\r\nof the British Realm. She thought it a little humiliating afterwards,\r\nbut for the moment all sorts of conventional barriers seemed to melt\r\naway. After all she was a woman, and some years ago she had been a young\r\none. Lord Redgrave was an almost perfect specimen of English manhood in\r\nits early prime. He was one of the richest peers in England, and he was\r\nbringing her her coffee. As she said afterwards, she wilted, and she\r\ncouldn't help it.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I have kept you waiting a long time for your coffee,\r\nladies,\" said Redgrave, as he balanced the tray on one hand and drew a\r\nwicker table towards them with the other. \"You see there are only two of\r\nus on board this craft, and as my engineer is navigating the ship, I\r\nhave to attend to the domestic arrangements.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Van Stuyler looked at him in the silence of mental paralysis. Miss\r\nZaidie frowned, smiled, and then began to laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Well, of all the cold-blooded English ways of putting things----\" she\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon?\" said Lord Redgrave as he put the tray down on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\"What Miss Rennick means, Lord Redgrave,\" interrupted Mrs. Van Stuyler,\r\nstruggling out of her paralytic condition, \"and what I, too, should like\r\nto say, is that under the circumstances----\"\r\n\r\n\"You think that I am not as penitent as I ought to be. Is that so?\" said\r\nRedgrave, with a glance and a smile mostly directed towards Miss Zaidie.\r\n\"Well, to tell you the truth,\" he went on, \"I am not a bit penitent. On\r\nthe contrary, I am very glad to have been able to assist the Fates as\r\nfar as I have done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Assist the Fates!\" gasped Mrs. Van Stuyler, helping herself shakingly\r\nto sugar, while Miss Zaidie folded a gossamer slice of bread and butter\r\nand began to eat it; \"I think, Lord Redgrave, that if you knew _all_ the\r\ncircumstances, you would say that you were working against them.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Mrs. Van Stuyler,\" he replied, as he filled his own coffee cup,\r\n\"I quite agree with you as to certain fates, but the Fates which I mean\r\nare the ones which, with good or bad reason, I think are working on my\r\nside. Besides, I _do_ know all the circumstances, or at least the most\r\nimportant of them. That knowledge is, in fact, my principal excuse for\r\nbringing you so unceremoniously above the clouds.\"\r\n\r\nAs he said this he took a sideway glance at Miss Zaidie. She dropped her\r\neyelids and went on eating her bread and butter; but there was a little\r\ndeepening of the flush on her cheeks which was to him as the first flush\r\nof sunrise to a benighted wanderer.\r\n\r\nThere was a rather awkward silence after this. Miss Zaidie stirred the\r\ncoffee in her cup with a dainty Queen Anne spoon, and seemed to\r\nconcentrate the whole of her attention upon the operation. Then Mrs. Van\r\nStuyler took a sip out of her cup and said:\r\n\r\n\"But really, Lord Redgrave, I feel that I must ask you whether you think\r\nthat what you have done during the last few minutes (which already, I\r\nassure you, seem hours to me) is--well, quite in accordance with\r\nthe--what shall I say--ah, the rules that we have been accustomed to\r\nlive under?\"\r\n\r\nLord Redgrave looked at Miss Zaidie again. She didn't even raise her\r\neyelids, only a very slight tremor of her hand as she raised her cup to\r\nher lips told that she was even listening. He took courage from this\r\nsign, and replied:\r\n\r\n\"My dear Mrs. Van Stuyler, the only answer that I can make to that just\r\nnow is to remind you that, by the sanction of ages, everything is\r\nsupposed to be fair under two sets of circumstances, and, whatever is\r\nhappening on the earth down yonder, we, I think, are not at war.\"\r\n\r\nThe next moment Miss Zaidie's eyelids lifted a little. There was a\r\ntremor about her lips almost too faint to be perceptible, and the\r\nslightest possible tinge of colour crept upwards towards her eyes. She\r\nput her cup down and got up, walked towards the glass walls of the\r\ndeck-chamber, and looked out over the cloud-scape.\r\n\r\nThe shortness of her steamer skirt made it possible for Lord Redgrave\r\nand Mrs. Van Stuyler to see that the sole of her right boot was swinging\r\nup and down on the heel ever so slightly. They came simultaneously to\r\nthe conclusion that if she had been alone she would have stamped, and\r\nstamped pretty hard. Possibly also she would have said things to herself\r\nand the surrounding silence. This seemed probable from the almost\r\nequally imperceptible motion of her shapely shoulders.\r\n\r\nMrs. Van Stuyler recognised in a moment that her charge was getting\r\nangry. She knew by experience that Miss Zaidie possessed a very proper\r\nspirit of her own, and that it was just as well not to push matters too\r\nfar. She further recognised that the circumstances were extraordinary,\r\nnot to say equivocal, and that she herself occupied a distinctly\r\npeculiar position.\r\n\r\nShe had accepted the charge of Miss Zaidie from her Uncle Russell for a\r\nconsideration counted partly by social advantages and partly by dollars.\r\nIn the most perfect innocence she had permitted not only her charge but\r\nherself to be abducted--for, after all, that was what it came to--from\r\nthe deck of an American liner, and carried, not only beyond the clouds,\r\nbut also beyond the reach of human law, both criminal and conventional.\r\n\r\nInwardly she was simply fuming with rage. As she said afterwards, she\r\nfelt just like a bottled volcano which would like to go off and daren't.\r\n\r\nAbout two minutes of somewhat surcharged silence passed. Mrs. Van\r\nStuyler sipped her coffee in ostentatiously small sips. Lord Redgrave\r\ntook his in slower and longer ones, and helped himself to bread and\r\nbutter. Miss Zaidie appeared perfectly contented with her contemplation\r\nof the clouds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nAt length Mrs. Van Stuyler, being a woman of large experience and some\r\nsocial deftness, recognised that a change of subject was the easiest way\r\nof retreat out of a rather difficult situation. So she put her cup down,\r\nleant back in her chair, and, looking straight into Lord Redgrave's\r\neyes, she said with purely feminine irrelevance:\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you know, Lord Redgrave, that, when we left, the machine\r\nwhich we call in America Manhood Suffrage--which, of course, simply\r\nmeans the selection of a government by counting noses which may or may\r\nnot have brains above them--was what some of our orators would call in\r\nfull blast. If you are going to New York after Washington, as you said\r\non the boat, we might find it a rather inconvenient time to arrive. The\r\nwhole place will be chaos, you know; because when the citizen of the\r\nUnited States begins electioneering, New York is not a very nice place\r\nto stop in except for people who want excitement, and so if you will\r\nexcuse me putting the question so directly, I should like to know what\r\nyou just do mean to do----\"\r\n\r\nLord Redgrave saw that she was going to add \"with us,\" but before he had\r\ntime to say anything, Miss Zaidie turned round, walked deliberately\r\ntowards her chair, sat down, poured herself out a fresh cup of coffee,\r\nadded the milk and sugar with deliberation, and then after a preliminary\r\nsip said, with her cup poised half-way between her dainty lips and the\r\ntable:\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Van, I've got an idea. I suppose it's inherited, for dear old Pop\r\nhad plenty. Anyhow we may as well get back to common-sense subjects. Now\r\nlook here,\" she went on, switching an absolutely convincing glance\r\nstraight into her host's eyes, \"my father may have been a dreamer, but\r\nstill he was a Sound Money man. He believed in honest dealings. He\r\ndidn't believe in borrowing a hundred dollars gold and paying back in\r\nfifty dollars silver. What's your opinion, Lord Redgrave; you don't do\r\nthat sort of thing in England, do you? Uncle Russell is a Sound Money\r\nman too. He's got too much gold locked up to want silver for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Zaidie,\" said Mrs. Van Stuyler, \"what _have_ democratic and\r\nrepublican politics and bimetalism got to do with----\"\r\n\r\n\"With a trip in this wonderful vessel which Pop told me years ago could\r\ngo up to the stars if it ever was made? Why just this, Lord Redgrave is\r\nan Englishman and too rich to believe in anything but sound money, so is\r\nUncle Russell, and there you have it, or should have.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I see what you mean, Miss Rennick,\" said their host, leaning\r\nback in his chair and folding his hands behind his head, as steamboat\r\ntravellers are wont to do when seas are smooth and skies are blue. \"The\r\n_Astronef_ might come down like a vision from the clouds and preach the\r\nGospel of Gold in electric rays of silver through the commonplace medium\r\nof the Morse Code. How's that for poetry and practice?\"\r\n\r\n\"I quite agree with his lordship as regards the practice,\" said Mrs. Van\r\nStuyler, talking somewhat rudely across him to Zaidie. \"It would be an\r\nexcellent use to put this wonderful invention to. And then, I am sure\r\nhis lordship would land us in Central Park, so that we could go to your\r\nUncle's house right away.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, I'm afraid I must ask you to excuse me there, Mrs. Van\r\nStuyler,\" said Redgrave, with a change of tone which Miss Zaidie\r\nappreciated with a swiftly veiled glance. \"You see, I have placed myself\r\nbeyond the law. I have, as you have been good enough to intimate,\r\nabducted--to put it brutally--two ladies from the deck of an Atlantic\r\nliner. Further, in doing so I have selfishly spoiled the prospects of\r\none of the ladies. But, seriously, I really must go to Washington\r\nfirst----\"\r\n\r\n\"I think, Lord Redgrave,\" interrupted Mrs. Van Stuyler, ignoring the\r\nlast unfinished sentence and assuming her best Knickerbocker dignity,\r\n\"if you will forgive me saying so, that that is scarcely a subject for\r\ndiscussion here.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if that's so,\" interrupted Miss Zaidie, \"the less we say about it\r\nthe better. What I wanted to say was this. We all want the Republicans\r\nin, at least all of us that have much to lose. Now, if Lord Redgrave was\r\nto use this wonderful air-ship of his on the right side--why there\r\nwouldn't be any standing against it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must say that until just now I had hardly contemplated turning the\r\n_Astronef_ into an electioneering machine. Still, I admit that she might\r\nbe made use of in a good cause, only I hope----\"\r\n\r\n\"That we shan't want you to paste her over with election bills, eh?--or\r\nstart handbill-snowstorms from the deck--or kidnap Croker and Bryan just\r\nas you did us, for instance?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I could, I'm quite sure that I shouldn't have as pleasant guests as\r\nI have now on board the _Astronef_. What do you think, Mrs. Van\r\nStuyler?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Lord Redgrave,\" she replied, \"that would be quite impossible.\r\nThe idea of being shut up in a ship like this which can soar not only\r\nfrom earth, but beyond the clouds, with people who would find out your\r\nbest secrets and then perhaps shoot you so as to be the only possessors\r\nof them--well, that would be foolishness indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, certainly it would,\" said Zaidie; \"the only use you could have for\r\npeople like that would be to take them up above the clouds and drop them\r\nout. But suppose we--I mean Lord Redgrave--took the _Astronef_ down over\r\nNew York and signalled messages from the sky at night with a\r\nsearchlight----\"\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" said their host, getting up from his deck-chair and stretching\r\nhimself up straight, looking the while at Miss Zaidie's averted profile.\r\n\"That's gorgeously good! We might even turn the election. I'm for sound\r\nmoney all the time, if I may be permitted to speak American.\"\r\n\r\n\"English is quite good enough for us, Lord Redgrave,\" said Miss Zaidie a\r\nlittle stiffly. \"We may have improved on the old language a bit, still\r\nwe understand it, and--well, we can forgive its shortcomings. But that\r\nisn't quite to the point.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me,\" said Mrs. Van Stuyler, \"that we are getting nearly as\r\nfar from the original subject as we are from the _St. Louis_. May I ask,\r\nZaidie, what you really propose to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Do_ is not for us to say,\" said Miss Zaidie, looking straight up to\r\nthe glass roof of the deck-chamber. \"You see, Mrs. Van, we're not free\r\nagents. We are not even first-class passengers who have paid their fares\r\non a contract ticket which is supposed to get them there.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you'll pardon me saying so,\" said Lord Redgrave, stopping his walk\r\nup and down the deck, \"that is not quite the case. To put it in the most\r\nbrutally material form, it is quite true that I have kidnapped you two\r\nladies and taken you beyond the reach of earthly law. But there is\r\nanother law, one which would bind a gentleman even if he were beyond the\r\nlimits of the Solar System, and so if you wish to be landed either in\r\nWashington or New York it shall be done. You shall be put down within a\r\ncarriage drive of your own residence, or of Mr. Russell Rennick's. I\r\nwill myself see you to his door, and there we may say goodbye, and I\r\nwill take my trip through the Solar System alone.\"\r\n\r\nThere was another pause after this, a pause pregnant with the fate of\r\ntwo lives. They looked at each other--Mrs. Van Stuyler at Zaidie, Zaidie\r\nat Lord Redgrave, and he at Mrs. Van Stuyler again. It was a kind of\r\nthree-cornered duel of eyes, and the eyes said a good deal more than\r\ncommon human speech could have done.\r\n\r\nThen Lord Redgrave, in answer to the last glance from Zaidie's eyes,\r\nsaid slowly and deliberately:\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to take any undue advantage, but I think I am justified in\r\nmaking one condition. Of course I can take you beyond the limits of the\r\nworld that we know, and to other worlds that we know little or nothing\r\nof. At least I could do so if I were not bound by law as strong as\r\ngravitation itself; but now, as I said before, I just ask whether or not\r\nmy guests or, if you think it suits the circumstances better, my\r\nprisoners, shall be released unconditionally wherever they choose to be\r\nlanded.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused for a moment and then, looking straight into Zaidie's eyes, he\r\nadded:\r\n\r\n\"The one condition I make is that the vote shall be unanimous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Under the circumstances, Lord Redgrave,\" said Mrs. Van Stuyler, rising\r\nfrom her seat and walking towards him with all the dignity that would\r\nhave been hers in her own drawing-room, \"there can only be one answer to\r\nthat. Your guests or your prisoners, as you choose to call them, must be\r\nreleased unconditionally.\"\r\n\r\nLord Redgrave heard these words as a man might hear words in a dream.\r\nZaidie had risen too. They were looking into each other's eyes, and many\r\nunspoken words were passing between them. There was a little silence,\r\nand then, to Mrs. Van Stuyler's unutterable horror, Zaidie said, with\r\njust the suspicion of a gasp in her voice:\r\n\r\n\"There's one dissentient. We are prisoners, and I guess I'd better\r\nsurrender at discretion.\"\r\n\r\nThe next moment her captor's arm was round her waist, and Mrs. Van\r\nStuyler, with her twitching fingers linked behind her back, and her nose\r\nat an angle of sixty degrees, was staring away through the blue\r\nimmensity, dumbly wondering what on earth or under heaven was going to\r\nhappen next.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of minutes of silence which could be felt, Mrs. Van\r\nStuyler turned round and said angrily:\r\n\r\n\"Zaidie, you will excuse me, perhaps, if I say that your conduct is\r\nnot--I mean has not been what I should have expected--what I did,\r\nindeed, expect from your uncle's niece when I undertook to take you to\r\nEurope. I must say----\"\r\n\r\n\"If I were you, Mrs. Van, I don't think I'd say much more about that,\r\nbecause, you see, it's fixed and done. Of course, Lord Redgrave's only\r\nan earl, and the other is a marquis, but, you see, he's a man, and I\r\ndon't quite think the other one is--and that's about all there is to\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nTheir host had just left the deck-saloon, taking the early coffee\r\napparatus with him, and Miss Zaidie, in the first flush of her pride and\r\nre-found happiness, was taking a promenade of about twelve strides each\r\nway, while Mrs. Van Stuyler, after partially relieving her feelings as\r\nabove, had seated herself stiffly in her wicker-chair, and was following\r\nher with eyes which were critical and, if they had been twenty years\r\nyounger, might also have been envious.\r\n\r\n\"Well, at least I suppose I must congratulate you on your ability to\r\naccommodate yourself to most extraordinary circumstances. I must say\r\nthat as far as that goes I quite envy you. I feel as though I ought to\r\nchoke or take poison, or something of that sort.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sakes, Mrs. Van, please don't talk like that!\" said Zaidie, stopping in\r\nher walk just in front of her chaperon's chair. \"Can't you see that\r\nthere's nothing extraordinary about the circumstances except this\r\nwonderful ship? I have told you how Pop and I met Lord Redgrave in our\r\ntour through the Canadian Rockies two or three years ago. No, it's two\r\nyears and nine months next June; and how he took an interest in Pop's\r\ntheories and ideas about this same ship that we are on now----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\" said Mrs. Van Stuyler rather acidly, \"and not only in the\r\nabstract ideas, but apparently in a certain concrete reality.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Van,\" laughed Zaidie, with a cunning twist on her heel, \"I know\r\nyou don't mean to be rude, but--well, now did any one ever call _you_ a\r\nconcrete reality? Of course it's correct just as a scientific\r\ndefinition, perhaps--still, anyhow, I guess it's not much good going on\r\nabout that. The facts are just this way. I consented to marry that\r\nByfleet marquis just out of sheer spite and blank ignorance. Lord\r\nRedgrave never actually asked me to marry him when we were in the\r\nRockies, but he did say when he went back to England that as soon as he\r\nhad realised my father's ideal he would come over and try and realise\r\none of his own. He was looking at me when he said it, and he looked a\r\ngood deal more than he said. Then he went away, and poor Pop died. Of\r\ncourse I couldn't write and tell him, and I suppose he was too proud to\r\nwrite before he'd done what he undertook to do, and I, like most\r\ngirl-fools in the same place would have done, thought that he'd given\r\nthe whole thing up and just looked upon the trip as a sort of interlude\r\nin globe-trotting, and thought no more about Pop's ideas and inventions\r\nthan he did about his daughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very natural, of course,\" said Mrs. Van Stuyler, somewhat mollified by\r\nthe subdued passion which Zaidie had managed to put into her commonplace\r\nwords; \"and so as you thought he had forgotten you and was finding a\r\nwife in his own country, and a possible husband came over from that same\r\ncountry with a coronet----\"\r\n\r\n\"That'll do, Mrs. Van, thank you,\" interrupted Miss Zaidie, bringing her\r\ndaintily-shod foot down on the deck this time with an unmistakable\r\nstamp. \"We'll consider that incident closed if you please. It was a\r\nmiserable, mean, sordid business altogether; I am utterly, hopelessly\r\nashamed of it and myself too. Just to think that I could ever----\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Van Stuyler cut short her indignant flow of words by a sudden\r\nuplifting of her eyelids and a swift turn of her head towards the\r\ncompanion way. Zaidie stamped again, this time more softly, and walked\r\naway to have another look at the clouds.\r\n\r\n\"Why, what on earth is the matter?\" she exclaimed, shrinking back from\r\nthe glass wall. \"There's nothing--we're not anywhere!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, Miss Rennick, you are on board the _Astronef_,\" said Lord\r\nRedgrave, as he reached the top of the companion way, \"and the\r\n_Astronef_ is at present travelling at about a hundred and fifty miles\r\nan hour above the clouds towards Washington. That is why you don't see\r\nthe clouds and sea as you did after we left the _St. Louis_. At a speed\r\nlike this they simply make a sort of grey-green blur. We shall be in\r\nWashington this evening, I hope.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-night, sir--I beg your pardon, my Lord!\" gasped Mrs. Van Stuyler. \"A\r\nhundred and fifty miles an hour! Surely that's impossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Mrs. Van Stuyler,\" said Redgrave, with a side-look at Zaidie,\r\n\"nowadays 'impossible' is hardly an English or even an American word. In\r\nfact, since I have had the honour of realising some of Professor\r\nRennick's ideas it has been relegated to the domain of mathematics. Not\r\neven he could make two and two more or less than four, but--well, would\r\nyou like to come into the conning-tower and see for yourselves? I can\r\nshow you a few experiments that will, at any rate, help to pass the time\r\nbetween here and Washington.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord Redgrave,\" said Mrs. Van Stuyler, dropping gracefully back into\r\nher wicker armchair, \"if I may say so, I have seen quite enough\r\nimpossibilities, and--er, well--other things since we left the deck of\r\nthe _St. Louis_ to keep me quite satisfied until, with your lordship's\r\npermission, I set foot on solid ground again, and I should also like to\r\nremind you that we have left everything behind us on the _St. Louis_,\r\neverything except what we stand up in, and--and----\"\r\n\r\n\"And therefore it will be a point of honour with me to see that you want\r\nfor nothing while you are on board the _Astronef_, and that you shall be\r\nreleased from your durance----\"\r\n\r\n\"Now don't say vile, Lenox--I mean----\"\r\n\r\n\"It is perfectly plain what you mean, Zaidie,\" said Mrs. Van Stuyler, in\r\na tone which seemed to send a chill through the deck-chamber. \"Really,\r\nthe American girl----\"\r\n\r\n\"Just wants to tell the truth,\" laughed Zaidie, going towards Redgrave.\r\n\"Lord Redgrave, if you like it better, says he wants to marry me, and,\r\npeer or peasant, I want to marry him, and that's all there is to it. You\r\ndon't suppose I'd have----\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear girl, there's no need to go into details,\" interrupted Mrs. Van\r\nStuyler, inspired by fond memories of her own youth; \"we will take that\r\nfor granted, and as we are beyond the social region in which chaperons\r\nare supposed to be necessary, I think I will have a nap.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we'll go to the conning-tower, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Breakfast will be ready in about half an hour,\" said Redgrave, as he\r\ntook Zaidie by the arm and led her towards the forward end of the\r\ndeck-chamber. \"Meanwhile, _au revoir_! If you want anything, touch the\r\nbutton at your right hand, just as you would on board the _St. Louis_.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank your lordship,\" said Mrs. Van Stuyler, half melting and half\r\nicy still. \"I shall be quite content to wait until you come back. Really\r\nI feel quite sleepy.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the effect of the elevation on the dear old lady's nerves,\"\r\nRedgrave whispered to Zaidie as he helped her up the narrow stairway\r\nwhich led to the glass-domed conning-tower, in which in days to come she\r\nwas destined to pass some of the most delightful and the most terrible\r\nmoments of her life.\r\n\r\n\"Then why doesn't it affect me that way?\" said Zaidie, as she took her\r\nplace in the little chamber, steel-walled and glass-roofed, and half\r\nfilled with instruments of which she, Vassar girl and all as she was,\r\ncould only guess the use.\r\n\r\n\"Well, to begin with, you are younger, which is an absolutely\r\nunnecessary observation; and in the second place, perhaps you were\r\nthinking about something else.\"\r\n\r\n\"By which I suppose you mean your lordship's noble self.\"\r\n\r\nThis was said in such a tone and with such an indescribable smile that\r\nthere immediately ensued a gap in the conversation, and a silence which\r\nwas a great deal more eloquent than any words could have made it.\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Zaidie had got free again she put her hands up to her hair,\r\nand while she was patting it into something like shape again she said:\r\n\r\n\"But I thought you brought me here to show me some experiments, and not\r\nto----\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to take advantage of the first real opportunity of tasting some of\r\nthe dearest delights that mortal man ever stole from earth or sea? Do\r\nyou remember that day when we were coming down from the big\r\nglacier--when your foot slipped and I just caught you and saved a\r\nsprained ankle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you wretch, and went away next day and left something like a\r\nbroken heart behind you! Why didn't you--Oh what idiots you men can be\r\nwhen you put your minds to it!\"\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't quite that, Zaidie. You see, I'd promised your father the day\r\nbefore--of course I was only a younger son then--that I wouldn't say\r\nanything about realising _my_ ideal until I had realised his, and\r\nso----\"\r\n\r\n\"And so I might have gone to Europe with Uncle Russell's millions to buy\r\nthat man Byfleet's coronet, and pay the price----\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't, Zaidie, don't! That is quite too horrible to think of, and as\r\nfor the coronet, well, I think I can give you one about as good as his,\r\nand one that doesn't want re-gilding. Good Lord, fancy you married to a\r\nthing like that! What could have made you think of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't think,\" she said angrily; \"I didn't think and I didn't feel.\r\nOf course I thought that I'd dropped right out of your life, and after\r\nthat I didn't care. I was mad right through, and I'd made up my mind to\r\ndo what others did--take a title and a big position, and have the\r\noutside as bright as I could get it, whatever the inside might be like.\r\nI'd made up my mind to be a society queen abroad, and a miserable woman\r\nat home--and, Lenox, thank God and you, that I wasn't!\"\r\n\r\nThen there was another interlude, and at the end of it Redgrave said:\r\n\r\n\"Wait till we've finished our honeymoon in space, and come back to\r\nearth. You won't want any coronets then, although you'll have one, for\r\nall the lands of earth won't hold another woman like yourself--your own\r\nsweet self! Of course it doesn't now, but--there, you know what I mean.\r\nYou'll have been to other worlds, you'll have made the round trip of the\r\nSolar System, so to say, and----\"\r\n\r\n\"And I think, dear, that is about promise of wonders enough, and of\r\nother things too--no, you are really quite too exacting. I thought you\r\nbrought me here to show me some of the wonders that this marvellous ship\r\nof yours can work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then just one more and I'll show you. Now you stand up there on that\r\nstep so that you can see all round, and watch with all your eyes,\r\nbecause you are going to see something that no woman ever saw before.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nAbove a tiny little writing-desk fixed to the wall of the conning-tower\r\nthere was a square mahogany board with six white buttons in pairs. On\r\none side of the board hung a telephone and on the other a speaking-tube.\r\nTo the right hand opposite where Zaidie stood were two nickel-plated\r\nwheels and behind each of them a white disc, one marked off into 360\r\ndegrees, and the other into 100 with subdivisions of tens. Overhead hung\r\nan ordinary tell-tale compass, and compactly placed on other parts of\r\nthe wall were barometers, thermometers, barographs, and, in fact,\r\npractically every instrument that the most exacting of aeronauts or\r\nSpace-explorers could have asked for.\r\n\r\n\"You see, Zaidie, this is what one might call the cerebral chamber of\r\nthe _Astronef_, and, granted that my engines worked all right, I could\r\nmake her do anything I wanted without moving out of here, but as a rule,\r\nof course, Murgatroyd is in the engine-room. If he wasn't the most\r\nwhole-souled Wesleyan that Yorkshire ever produced, I believe he'd\r\nbecome an idolater and worship the _Astronef's_ engines.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who is Murgatroyd, please?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the first place he is what I might call an hereditary retainer of\r\nthe House of Redgrave. His ancestors have served mine for the last seven\r\nhundred years. When my ancestors were burglar-barons, his were\r\nmen-at-arms. When we went on the Crusades they went too; when we raised\r\na regiment for the King against the Parliament they were naturally the\r\nfirst to enlist in it; and as we gradually settled down into peaceful\r\nrespectability they did the same. Lastly, when we went into trade as\r\nironmasters and engineers they went in too. This Murgatroyd, for\r\ninstance, was master-foreman of my works at Smeaton, and he was the only\r\nman I dared trust with the secrets of the _Astronef_, and the only one I\r\nwould trust myself on board her with, and that's why we're a crew of\r\ntwo. You see the command of a vessel like this is a fairly big business,\r\nand if it got into the wrong sort of hands----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I see,\" said Zaidie with a little nod. \"It would be just too awful\r\nto think about. Why you might keep the world in terror with it; but I\r\nknow you wouldn't do that, because, for one thing, I wouldn't let you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gently, gently, Ma'm'selle; permit me most humbly to remind you that\r\nyou are still my prisoner, and that I am still Commander of the\r\n_Astronef_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, very well then,\" said Zaidie, interrupting him with a pretty little\r\ngesture of impatience, \"and now suppose you let me see what the\r\n_Astronef's_ commander can do with her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied Redgrave, \"and with the greatest pleasure--but, by\r\nthe way, that reminds me you haven't paid your footing yet.\"\r\n\r\nWhen due payment had been given and taken, or perhaps it would be more\r\ncorrect to say taken and given, Redgrave put his finger on one of the\r\nbuttons.\r\n\r\nImmediately Zaidie heard the swish of the air past the smooth wall of\r\nthe conning-tower grow fainter and fainter. Then there came a little\r\ncheck which nearly upset her balance, and presently the clouds beneath\r\nthem began to take shape and great white continents of them with grey\r\noceans in between went sweeping silently and swiftly away behind them.\r\n\r\nRedgrave turned the wheel in front of the 100-degree disc a little to\r\nthe left. The next instant the clouds rose up. For a moment Zaidie could\r\nsee nothing but white mist on all sides. Then the atmosphere cleared\r\nagain, and she saw far below her what looked like a vast expanse of\r\nocean that had been suddenly frozen solid.\r\n\r\nThere were the long Atlantic rollers tipped with snowy foam. Here and\r\nthere at wide intervals were little black dots, some of them with brown\r\ntrails behind them, others with little patches of white which showed up\r\ndistinctly against the dark grey-blue of the sea. Every moment they grew\r\nbigger. Then the white-crested waves began to move, and the big ocean\r\nsteamers and full-rigged sailing ships looked less and less like toys.\r\nJust under them there was a very big one with four funnels pouring out\r\ndense volumes of black smoke. Redgrave took up a pair of glasses, looked\r\nat her for a moment and said:\r\n\r\n\"That's the _Deutschland_, the new Hamburg-American record-breaker.\r\nSuppose we go down and have a lark with her. I wonder if she's taking\r\nnews of the war. We're in with Germany, and they may know something\r\nabout it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be just too lovely!\" said Zaidie. \"Let's go and show them\r\nhow _we_ can break records. I suppose they've seen us by this time and\r\nare just wondering with all their wits what we are. I guess they'll feel\r\npretty tired about poor Count Zeppelin's balloon when they see _us_.\"\r\n\r\nRedgrave noted the \"we\" and the \"us\" with much secret satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" he said, \"we'll go and give them a bit of a startler.\"\r\n\r\nIn front of the conning-tower there was a steel flagstaff about ten feet\r\nhigh, with halliards rove through a sheer in the top. He took a little\r\nroll of bunting out of a locker under the desk, opened a glass slide,\r\nbrought in the halliards and bent the flag on.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the long shape of the great liner was getting bigger and\r\nbigger. Her decks were black, with people staring up at this strange\r\napparition which was dropping upon them from the clouds. Another minute\r\nand the _Astronef_ had dropped to within five hundred feet of the water,\r\nand about half a mile astern of the _Deutschland_. Redgrave turned the\r\nwheel back two or three inches and touched a second button.\r\n\r\nThe _Astronef_ stopped her descent instantly, and then she shot forward.\r\nThe new greyhound was making her twenty-two and a half knots, hurling a\r\nbroad white torrent of foam away from under her counters. But in half a\r\nminute the _Astronef_ was alongside her.\r\n\r\nRedgrave ran the roll of bunting up to the top of the flagstaff, pulled\r\none of the halliards, and the White Ensign of England floated out.\r\nAlmost at the same moment the German flag went up to the staff at the\r\nstern of the _Deutschland_, and they heard a roar of cheers, mingled\r\nwith cries of wonder, come up from her swarming decks.\r\n\r\nEach flag was dipped thrice in due course. Redgrave took off his cap and\r\nbowed to the Captain on the bridge. Zaidie nodded and fluttered her\r\nhandkerchief in reply to hundreds of others that were waving on the\r\ndecks. Mrs. Van Stuyler woke up in wonder and waved hers instinctively,\r\nhalf longing to change crafts. In fact, if it hadn't been for her\r\nabsolute devotion to the proprieties she would have obeyed her first\r\nimpulse and asked Lord Redgrave to put her on board the steamer.\r\n\r\nWhile the officers and crew and passengers of the _Deutschland_ were\r\nstaring wide-eyed and open-mouthed at the graceful glittering shape of\r\nthe _Astronef_, Redgrave touched the first button in the second row\r\nonce, moved the 100-degree wheel on a few degrees, and then gave the\r\nother a quarter turn. Then he closed the window slide, and the next\r\nmoment Zaidie saw the great liner sink down beneath them in a curious\r\ntwisting sort of way. She seemed to stop still and then spin round on\r\nher centre, getting smaller and smaller every moment.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, Lenox?\" she said, with a little gasp. \"What's the\r\n_Deutschland_ doing? She seems to be spinning round on her own axis like\r\na top.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's only the point of view, dear. She's just plugging along straight\r\non her way to New York, and we've been making rings round her and going\r\nup all the time. But of course you don't notice the motion here any more\r\nthan you would if you were in a balloon.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I thought you were going to speak them. Surely you don't mean to\r\nsay that you intended that just as a little bit of showing off?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's about what it comes to, I suppose, but you must not think it was\r\naltogether vanity. You see the German Government has bought Count\r\nZeppelin's air-ship or steerable balloon, as it ought to be called,\r\nalways supposing that they can steer it in a wind, and of course their\r\nidea is to make a fighting machine of it. Now Germany is engaged to\r\nstand by us in this trouble that's coming, and by way of cementing the\r\nalliance I thought it was just as well to let the wily Teuton know that\r\nthere's something flying the British flag which could make very small\r\nmincemeat of their gas-bags.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what about Old Glory?\" said Miss Zaidie. \"The _Astronef_ was built\r\nwith English money and English skill, but----\"\r\n\r\n\"She is the creature of American genius. Of course she is. In fact she\r\nis the first concrete symbol of the Anglo-American Alliance, and when\r\nthe daughter of her creator has gone into partnership with the man who\r\nmade her we'll have two flagstaff's, and the Jack and Old Glory will\r\nfloat side by side.\"\r\n\r\n\"And meanwhile where are we going?\" asked Zaidie, after a moment's\r\ninterval. \"Ah, there we are through the clouds again. What makes us\r\nrise? Is that the force that Pop told me he discovered?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll answer the last question first,\" said Redgrave. \"That was the\r\ngreatest of your father's discoveries. He got at the secret of\r\ngravitation, and was able to analyse it into two separate forces just as\r\nVolta did with electricity--positive and negative, or, to put it better,\r\nattractive and repulsive.\r\n\r\n\"Three out of the five sets of engines in the _Astronef_ develop the R.\r\nForce, as I call it for short. This wheel with the hundred degrees\r\nmarked behind it regulates the development. The further I turn it this\r\nway to the right, the more the R. Force overcomes the attractive force\r\nof the earth or any other planet that we may visit. Turn it back, and\r\ngravitation asserts itself. If I put this arrow-head on the wheel\r\nopposite zero the weight of the _Astronef_ is about a hundred and fifty\r\ntons, and of course she would go down like a stone, and a very big one\r\nat that. At ten she weighs nothing; that is to say the R. Force exactly\r\ncounteracts gravitation. At eleven she begins to rise. At a hundred she\r\nwould be hurled away from the earth like a shell from a twelve-inch gun,\r\nor even faster. Now, watch.\"\r\n\r\nHe took up the speaking-tube. \"Is she all tight everywhere, Andrew?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my Lord,\" came gurgling through the tube.\r\n\r\nThen Redgrave slowly turned the wheel till the indicator pointed to\r\ntwenty-five. Zaidie, all eyes and wonder, saw a vast sea of glittering\r\nwhite spread out beneath them, an ocean of snow with grey-blue patches\r\nhere and there. It sank away from under them till the patches became\r\nspots and the sunlit clouds a vast, luminous blur. The air about them\r\ngrew marvellously clear and limpid. The sun blazed down on them with a\r\ntenfold intensity of light, but Zaidie was astonished to find that very\r\nlittle heat penetrated the glass walls and roof of the conning-tower.\r\n\r\n\"What an awful height!\" she exclaimed, looking round at him with\r\nsomething like fear in her eyes. \"How high are we, Lenox?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll find afterwards that the _Astronef_ doesn't take any account of\r\nhigh or low or up or down,\" he replied, looking at the dial of an\r\naneroid barometer by the side of him. \"Roughly speaking, we're rather\r\nover 60,000 feet--say ten miles--from the surface of the Atlantic.\r\nThat's why I asked Andrew whether everything was tight. You see we\r\ncouldn't breathe the air there is outside there--too thin and cold--and\r\nso the _Astronef_ makes her own atmosphere as we go along. But I won't\r\nspoil what you're going to see by any more of this. So if you please,\r\nwe'll go down now and get along to Washington. Anyhow, I hope I've\r\nconvinced you so far that I've kept my promise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear, you have, and splendidly! I've only one regret. If _he_ was\r\nonly here now, what a happy man he'd be! Still, I daresay he knows all\r\nabout it and is just as happy. In fact he must be. I feel certain he\r\nmust. The very soul of his intellect was in the dream of this ship, and\r\nnow that it's a reality he must be here still. Isn't it part of himself?\r\nIsn't it his mind that's working in these wonderful engines of yours,\r\nand isn't it his strength that lifts us up from the earth and takes us\r\ndown again just as you please to turn that wheel?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's little doubt about that, Zaidie,\" said Redgrave quietly, but\r\nearnestly. \"You know we North-country folk all have our traditions and\r\nour ghosts; and what more likely than that the spirit of a dead man or a\r\nman gone to other worlds should watch over the realisation of his\r\ngreatest work on earth? Why shouldn't we believe that, we who are going\r\naway from this world to other ones?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" interrupted Zaidie, \"why, of course we will. And now suppose\r\nwe come down in more ways than one and go and give poor Mrs. Van Stuyler\r\nsomething to eat and drink. The dear old girl must be frightened half\r\nout of her wits by this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" replied Redgrave; \"but we'll come down literally first, so\r\nthat we can get the propellers to work.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned the wheel back till the indicator pointed to five. The\r\ncloud-sea came up with a rush. They passed through it, and stopped about\r\na thousand feet above the sea. Redgrave touched the first button twice,\r\nand then the next one twice. The air began to hiss past the walls of the\r\nconning-tower. The crest-crowned waves of the Atlantic seemed to sweep\r\nin a hurrying torrent behind them, and then Redgrave, having made sure\r\nthat Murgatroyd was at the after-wheel, gave him the course for\r\nWashington, and then went down to induct his bride-elect into the art\r\nand mystery of cooking by electricity as it was done in the kitchen of\r\nthe _Astronef_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nAs this narrative is the story of the personal adventures of Lord\r\nRedgrave and his bride, and not an account of events at which all the\r\nworld has already wondered, there is no necessity to describe in any\r\ndetail the extraordinary sequence of circumstances which began when the\r\n_Astronef_ dropped without warning from the clouds in front of the White\r\nHouse at Washington, and his lordship, after paying his respects to the\r\nPresident, proceeded to the British Embassy and placed the copy of the\r\nAnglo-American agreement in Lord Pauncefote's hands.\r\n\r\nMrs. Van Stuyler's spirits had risen as the _Astronef_ descended towards\r\nthe lights of Washington, and when the President and Lord Pauncefote\r\npaid a visit to the wonderful craft, the joint product of American\r\ngenius and English capital and constructive skill, she immediately\r\nassumed, at Redgrave's request, the position of lady of the house _pro\r\ntem._, and described the \"change of plans,\" as she called it, which led\r\nto their transfer from the _St. Louis_ to the _Astronef_ with an\r\nimaginative fluency which would have done credit to the most\r\nenterprising of American interviewers.\r\n\r\n\"You see, my dear,\" she said to Zaidie afterwards, \"as everything turned\r\nout so very happily, and as Lord Redgrave behaved in such a splendid\r\nway, I thought it was my duty to make everything appear as pleasant to\r\nthe President and Lord Pauncefote as I could.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was real good of you, Mrs. Van,\" said Zaidie. \"If I hadn't been\r\nparalysed with admiration I believe I should have laughed. Now if you'll\r\njust come with us on our trip, and write a book about it afterwards just\r\nas you told--I mean as you described what happened between the _St.\r\nLouis_ and Washington, to the President and Lord Pauncefote, you'd make\r\na million dollars out of it. Say now, won't you come?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Zaidie,\" Mrs. Van Stuyler replied, \"you know that I am very\r\nfond of you. If I'd only had a daughter I should have wanted her to be\r\njust like you, and I should have wanted her to marry a man just like\r\nLord Redgrave. But there's a limit to everything. You say that you are\r\ngoing to the moon and the stars, and to see what the other planets are\r\nlike. Well, that's your affair. I hope God will forgive you for your\r\npresumption, and let you come back safe, but I----No. Ten--twenty\r\nmillions wouldn't pay me to tempt Providence like that.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Astronef_ had landed in front of the White House, as everybody\r\nknows, on the eve of the Presidential election. After dinner in the\r\ndeck-saloon, as the Space Navigator lay in the midst of a square of\r\ntroops, outside which a huge crowd surged and struggled to get a look at\r\nthe latest miracle of constructive science, the President and the\r\nBritish Ambassador said goodbye, and as soon as the gangway ladder was\r\ndrawn in the _Astronef_, moved by no visible agency, rose from the\r\nground amidst a roar of cheers coming from a hundred thousand throats.\r\nShe stopped at a height of about a thousand feet, and then her forward\r\nsearchlight flashed out, swept the horizon, and vanished. Then it\r\nflashed out again intermittently in the longs and shorts of the Morse\r\nCode, and these, when translated, read:\r\n\r\n\"Vote for sound men and sound money!\"\r\n\r\nIn five minutes the wires of the United States were alive with the\r\nterse, pregnant message, and under the ocean in the dark depths of the\r\nAtlantic ooze, vivid narratives of the coming of the miracle went\r\nflashing to a hundred newspaper offices in England and on the Continent.\r\nThe New York correspondent of the London _Daily Express_ added the\r\nfollowing paragraph to his account of the strange occurrence:\r\n\r\n\"The secret of this amazing vessel, which has proved itself capable of\r\ntraversing the Atlantic in a day, and of soaring beyond the limits of\r\nthe atmosphere at will, is possessed by one man only, and that man is an\r\nEnglish nobleman. The air is full of rumours of universal war. One\r\nvessel such as this could scatter terror over a continent in a few days,\r\ndemoralise armies and fleets, reduce Society to chaos, and establish a\r\none-man despotism on the ruins of all the Governments of the world. The\r\nman who could build one ship like this could build fifty, and, if his\r\ncountry asked him to do it, no doubt he would. Those who, as we are\r\nalmost forced to believe, are even now contemplating a serious attempt\r\nto dethrone England from her supreme place among the nations of Europe,\r\nwill do well to take this latest potential factor in the warfare of the\r\nimmediate future into their most serious consideration.\"\r\n\r\nThis paragraph was not perhaps as absolutely correct as a proposition in\r\nEuclid, but it stopped the war. The _Deutschland_ came in the next day,\r\nand again the press was flooded, this time with personal narratives, and\r\nbrilliantly imaginative descriptions of the Vision which had descended\r\nfrom the clouds, made rings round the great liner going at her best\r\nspeed, and then vanished in an instant beyond the range of field-glasses\r\nand telescopes.\r\n\r\nThus did the creature of Professor Rennick's inventive genius play its\r\nfirst part as the peacemaker of the world.\r\n\r\nWhen the _Astronef's_ message had been duly given and recorded, her\r\npropellers began to revolve, and her head swung round to the north-east.\r\nSo began, as all the world now knows, the most extraordinary\r\nelectioneering trip that ever was known. First Baltimore, then\r\nPhiladelphia, and then New York saw the flashes in the sky. There were\r\nilluminations, torchlight processions, and all the machinery of American\r\nelectioneering going at full blast. But when people saw, far away up in\r\nthe starlit night, those swiftly-changing beams glittering down, as it\r\nwere, out of infinite Space, and when the telegraph operators caught on\r\nto the fact that they were signals, a sort of awe seemed to come over\r\nboth Republicans and Democrats alike. Even Tammany's thoughts began to\r\nlift above the sordid level of boodle. It was almost like a message from\r\nanother world. There was something supernatural about it, and when it\r\nwas translated and rushed out in extra editions of the evening papers:\r\n\"Vote for sound men and sound money\" became the watchword of millions.\r\n\r\nFrom New York to Boston, Boston to Albany, and then across country to\r\nBuffalo, Cleveland, Chicago, Omaha--then westward to St. Paul and\r\nMinneapolis, and northward to Portland and Seattle, southward to San\r\nFrancisco and Monterey, then eastward again to Salt Lake City, and then,\r\nafter a leap across the Rockies which frightened Mrs. Van Stuyler almost\r\nto fainting point and made Zaidie gasp for breath, away southward to\r\nSanta Fé and New Orleans.\r\n\r\nThen northward again up the Mississippi Valley to St. Louis, and thence\r\neastward across the Alleghanies back to Washington--such was the famous\r\nnight-voyage of the _Astronef_, and so by means of that long silver\r\ntongue of light did she spread the message of common-sense and\r\ncommercial honesty throughout the length and breadth of the Great\r\nRepublic. The world knows how America received and interpreted it the\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mr. Russell Rennick had taken train to Washington, and the day\r\nafter the election he willingly took back all that he had intended with\r\nregard to the Marquis of Byfleet, accepted Lord Redgrave in his stead,\r\nand bestowed his avuncular blessing at the wedding breakfast held in the\r\ndeck-chamber of the _Astronef_ poised in mid-air, five hundred feet\r\nabove the dome of the Capitol, a week later. To this he added a cheque\r\nfor a million dollars--payable to the Countess of Redgrave on her return\r\nfrom her wedding trip.\r\n\r\nBreakfast over, the wedding party made an inspection of the wonderful\r\nvessel under the guidance of her Commander. After this, while they were\r\ndrinking their coffee and liqueurs, and the men were smoking their\r\ncigars in the deck-chamber, a score of the most distinguished men and\r\nwomen in the United States experienced the novel sensation of sitting\r\nquietly in deck-chairs while they were being hurled at the rate of a\r\nhundred and fifty miles an hour through the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThey ran up to Niagara, dropped to within a few feet of the surface of\r\nthe Falls, passed over them, fell to the Rapids, and drifted down them\r\nwithin a couple of yards of the raging waters. Then in an instant they\r\nleapt up into the clouds, dropped again, and took a slanting course for\r\nWashington at a speed incredible, but to them quite imperceptible, save\r\nfor the blurred rush of the half-visible earth behind them.\r\n\r\nThat night the _Astronef_ rested again in front of the steps of the\r\nWhite House, and Lord and Lady Redgrave were the guests at a\r\nsemi-official banquet given by the newly re-elected President. The\r\nspeech of the evening was made by the President himself in proposing the\r\nhealth of the bride and bridegroom, and this is the way he ended:\r\n\r\n\"There is something more in the ceremony which we have been privileged\r\nto witness than the union of a man and a woman in the bonds of holy\r\nmatrimony. Lord Redgrave, as you know, is the descendant of one of the\r\nnoblest and most ancient families in the Motherland of New Nations. Lady\r\nRedgrave is the daughter of the oldest and, I hope I may be allowed to\r\nsay without offence, the greatest of those nations. It is, perhaps,\r\nearly days to talk about a formal federation of the Anglo-Saxon people,\r\nbut I think I am only voicing the sentiments of every good American when\r\nI say that, if the rumours which have drifted over and under the\r\nAtlantic, rumours of a determined attempt on the part of certain\r\nEuropean powers to assault and, if possible, destroy that magnificent\r\nfortress of individual liberty and collective equity which we call the\r\nBritish Empire should unhappily prove to be true, then it may be that\r\nthe rest of the world will find that America does not speak English for\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\"But I must also remind you that a few yards from the doors of the White\r\nHouse there lies the greatest marvel, I had almost said the greatest\r\nmiracle, that has ever been accomplished by human genius and human\r\nindustry. That wonderful vessel in which some of us have been privileged\r\nto take the most marvellous journey in the history of mechanical\r\nlocomotion was thought out by an American man of science, the man whose\r\ndaughter sits on my right hand to-night. In her concrete material form\r\nthis vessel, destined to navigate the shoreless Ocean of Space, is\r\nEnglish. But she is also the result of the belief and the faith of an\r\nEnglishman in an American ideal.... So when she leaves this earth, as\r\nshe will do in an hour or so, to enter the confines of other worlds than\r\nthis--and, it may be, to make the acquaintance of peoples other than\r\nthose who inhabit the earth--she will have done infinitely more than she\r\nhas already done, incredible as that seems. She will not only have\r\nconvinced this world that the greatest triumph of human genius is of\r\nAnglo-Saxon origin, but she will carry to other worlds than this the\r\ntruth which this world will have learnt before the nineteenth century\r\nends.\r\n\r\n\"England in the person of Lord Redgrave, and America in the person of\r\nhis Countess, leave this world to-night to tell the other worlds of our\r\nsystem, if haply they may find some intelligible means of communication,\r\nwhat this world, good and bad, is like. And it is within the bounds of\r\npossibility that in doing so they may inaugurate a wider fellowship of\r\ncreated beings than the limits of this world permit; a fellowship, a\r\nfriendship, and, as the _Astronef_ entitles us to believe, even a\r\nphysical communication of world with world which, in the dawn of the\r\ntwentieth century, may transcend in sober fact the wildest dreams of all\r\nthe philanthropists and the philosophers who have sought to educate\r\nhumanity from Socrates to Herbert Spencer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the _Astronef's_ forward searchlight had flashed its farewells to\r\nthe thronging, cheering crowds of Washington, her propellers began to\r\nwhirl, and she swung round northward on her way to say goodbye to the\r\nEmpire City.\r\n\r\nA little before midnight her two lights flashed down over New York and\r\nBrooklyn, and were almost instantly answered by hundreds of electric\r\nbeams streaming up from different parts of the Twin Cities, and from\r\nseveral men-of-war lying in the bay and the river.\r\n\r\n\"Goodbye for the present! Have you any messages for Mars?\" flickered out\r\nfrom above the _Astronef's_ conning-tower.\r\n\r\nWhat Uncle Sam's message was, if he had one, was never deciphered, for\r\nfifty beams began dotting and dashing at once, and the result was that\r\nnothing but a blur of many mingled rays reached the conning-tower from\r\nwhich Lord Redgrave and his bride were taking their last look at human\r\nhabitations.\r\n\r\n\"You might have known that they would all answer at once,\" said Zaidie.\r\n\"I suppose the newspapers, of course, want interviews with the leading\r\nMartians, and the others want to know what there is to be done in the\r\nway of trade. Anyhow, it would be a feather in Uncle Sam's cap if he\r\nmade the first Reciprocity Treaty with another world.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then proceeded to corner the commerce of the Solar System,\" laughed\r\nRedgrave. \"Well, we'll see what can be done. Although I think, as an\r\nEnglishman, I ought to look after the Open Door.\"\r\n\r\n\"So that the Germans could get in before you, eh? That's just like you\r\ndear, good-natured English. But look,\" she went on, pointing downwards,\r\n\"they're signalling again, all at once this time.\"\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen beams shone out together from the principal newspaper\r\noffices of New York. Then simultaneously they began the dotting and\r\ndashing again. Redgrave took them down in pencil, and when the\r\nsignalling had stopped he read off:\r\n\r\n\"No war. Dual Alliance climbs down. Don't like idea of _Astronef_.\r\nCables just received. Goodbye, and good luck! Come back soon, and safe!\"\r\n\r\n\"What? We have stopped the war!\" exclaimed Zaidie, clasping his arm.\r\n\"Well, thank God for that. How could we begin our voyage better? You\r\nremember what we were saying the other day, Lenox. If that's only true,\r\nmy father somewhere knows now what a blessing he has given his brother\r\nmen! We've stopped a war which might have deluged the world in blood.\r\nWe've saved perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives, and kept sorrow from\r\nthousands of homes. Lenox, when we get back, you and the States and the\r\nBritish Government will have to build a fleet of these ships, and then\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon race must say to the rest of the world----\"\r\n\r\n\"The millennium has come and its presiding goddess is Zaidie Redgrave.\r\nIf you don't stop fighting, disband your armies and turn your fleets\r\ninto liners and cargo boats, she'll proceed to sink your ships and\r\ndecimate your armies until you learn sense. Is that what you mean,\r\ndear?\" laughed Redgrave, as he slipped his left hand round her waist and\r\nlaid his right on the searchlight-switch to reply to the message.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be ridiculous, Lenox. Still, I suppose that is something like it.\r\nThey wouldn't deserve anything else if they were fools enough to go on\r\nfighting after they knew we could wipe them out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. I perfectly agree with your Ladyship, but still sufficient\r\nunto the day is the Armageddon thereof. Now I suppose we'd better say\r\ngoodbye and be off.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what a goodbye,\" whispered Zaidie, with an upward glance into the\r\nstarlit ocean of Space which lay above and around them. \"Goodbye to the\r\nworld itself! Well, say it, Lenox, and let us go; I want to see what the\r\nothers are like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well then; goodbye it is,\" he said, beginning to jerk the switch\r\nbackwards and forwards with irregular motions, sending short flashes and\r\nlonger beams down towards the earth.\r\n\r\nThe Empire City read the farewell message.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God for the peace. Goodbye for the present. We shall convey the\r\njoint compliments of John Bull and Uncle Sam to the peoples of the\r\nplanets when we find them. _Au revoir!_\"\r\n\r\nThe message was answered by the blaze of the concentrated searchlights\r\nfrom land and sea all directed on the _Astronef_. For a moment her\r\nshining shape glittered like a speck of diamond in the midst of the\r\nluminous haze far up in the sky, and then it vanished for many an\r\nanxious day from mortal sight.\r\n\r\nA few moments later Zaidie pointed over the stern and said:\r\n\r\n\"Look, there's the moon! Just fancy--our first stopping place! Well, it\r\ndoesn't look so very far off at present.\"\r\n\r\nRedgrave turned and saw the pale yellow crescent of the new moon\r\nswimming high above the eastern edge of the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\n\"It almost looks as if we could steer straight to it right over the\r\nwater--only, of course, it wouldn't wait there for us,\" she went on.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it'll be there when we want it, never fear,\" he laughed, \"and,\r\nafter all, it's only a mere matter of about two hundred and forty\r\nthousand miles away, and what's that in a trip that will cover hundreds\r\nof millions? It will just be a sort of jumping-off place into Space for\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still, I shouldn't like to miss seeing it,\" she said. \"I want to see\r\nwhat there is on that other side which nobody has ever seen yet, and\r\nsettle that question about air and water. Won't it just be heavenly to\r\nbe able to come back and tell them all about it at home? But just fancy\r\nme talking stuff like this when we are going, perhaps, to solve some of\r\nthe hidden mysteries of Creation, and, may be, look upon things that\r\nhuman eyes were never meant to see,\" she went on, with a sudden change\r\nin her voice.\r\n\r\nHe felt a little shiver in the arm that was resting upon his, and his\r\nhand went down and caught hers.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we shall see a good many marvels, and, perhaps, miracles, before\r\nwe come back, but why should there be anything in Creation that the eyes\r\nof created beings should not look upon? Anyhow, there's one thing we\r\nshall do I hope, we shall solve once and for all the great problem of\r\nthe worlds.\r\n\r\n\"Look, for instance,\" he went on, turning round and pointing to the\r\nwest, \"there is Venus following the sun. In a few days I hope you and I\r\nwill be standing on her surface, perhaps trying to talk by signs with\r\nher inhabitants, and taking photographs of her scenery. There's Mars\r\ntoo, that little red one up yonder. Before we come back we shall have\r\nsettled a good many problems about him, too. We shall have navigated the\r\nrings of Saturn, and perhaps graphed them from his surface. We shall\r\nhave crossed the bands of Jupiter, and found out whether they are clouds\r\nor not; perhaps we shall have landed on one of his moons and taken a\r\nvoyage round him.\r\n\r\n\"Still, that's not the question just now, and if you are in a hurry to\r\ncircumnavigate the moon we'd better begin to get a wriggle on us as they\r\nsay down yonder; so come below and we'll shut up. A bit later I'll show\r\nyou something that no human eyes have ever seen.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" she asked as they turned away towards the companion\r\nladder.\r\n\r\n\"I won't spoil it by telling you,\" he said, stopping at the top of the\r\nstairs and taking her by the shoulders. \"By the way,\" he went on, \"I may\r\nremind your Ladyship that you are just now drawing the last breaths of\r\nearthly air which you will taste for some time, in fact until we get\r\nback. And you may as well take your last look at earth as earth, for the\r\nnext time you see it it will be a planet.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned to the open window and looked over into the enormous void\r\nbeneath, for all this time the _Astronef_ had been mounting swiftly\r\ntowards the zenith.\r\n\r\nShe could see, by the growing moonlight, vast, vague shapes of land and\r\nsea. The myriad lights of New York and Brooklyn were mingled in a tiny\r\npatch of dimly luminous haze. The air about her had suddenly grown\r\nbitterly cold, and she saw that the stars and planets were shining with\r\na brilliancy she had never seen before. Redgrave came back to her, and\r\nlaying his arm across her shoulder, said:\r\n\r\n\"Well, have you said goodbye to your native world? It is a bit solemn,\r\nisn't it, saying goodbye to a world that you have been born on; which\r\ncontains everything that has made up your life, everything that is dear\r\nto you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not quite everything,\" she said, looking up at him--\"at least I don't\r\nthink so.\"\r\n\r\nHe lost no time in making the only reply which was appropriate under the\r\ncircumstances; and then he said, drawing her close to him:\r\n\r\n\"Nor I, as _you_ know, darling. This is our world, a world travelling\r\namong worlds, and since I have been able to bring the most delightful of\r\nthe daughters of Terra with me, I, at any rate, am perfectly happy. Now,\r\nI think it's getting on to supper time, so if your Ladyship will go to\r\nyour household duties, I'll have a look at my engines and make\r\neverything snug for the voyage.\"\r\n\r\nThe first thing he did when he left the conning-tower was to\r\nhermetically close every external opening in the ship. Then he went and\r\ncarefully inspected the apparatus for purifying the air and supplying it\r\nwith fresh oxygen from the tanks in which it was stored in liquid form.\r\nLastly he descended into the lower hold and turned on the energy of\r\nrepulsion to its fullest extent, at the same time stopping the engines\r\nwhich had been working the propellers.\r\n\r\nIt was now no longer necessary or even possible to steer the _Astronef_.\r\nShe was directed solely by the repulsive force which would carry her\r\nwith ever-increasing swiftness, as the attraction of the earth\r\ndiminished, towards that neutral point at which the attraction of the\r\nearth is exactly balanced by the moon. Her momentum would carry her past\r\nthis point, and then the \"R. Force\" would be gradually brought into play\r\nin order to avert the unpleasant consequences of a fall of some forty\r\nodd thousand miles.\r\n\r\nAndrew Murgatroyd, relieved from his duties in the wheel-house, made a\r\ncareful inspection of the auxiliary machinery, which was under his\r\nspecial charge, and then retired to his quarters in the after end of the\r\nvessel to prepare his own evening meal.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, her Ladyship, with the help of the ingenious contrivances\r\nwith which the kitchen of the _Astronef_ was stocked, had prepared a\r\ndainty little _souper à deux_. Her husband opened a bottle of the finest\r\nchampagne that the cellars of Smeaton could supply, to drink to the\r\nprosperity of the voyage, and the health of his beautiful\r\nfellow-voyager. When he had filled the two tall glasses the wine began\r\nto run over the side which was toward the stern of the vessel. They took\r\nno notice of this at first, but when Zaidie put her glass down she\r\nstared at it for a moment, and said, in a half-frightened voice:\r\n\r\n\"Why, what's the matter, Lenox? look at the wine! It won't keep\r\nstraight, and yet the table's perfectly level--and see! the water in the\r\njug looks as though it were going to run up the side.\"\r\n\r\nRedgrave took up the glass and held it balanced in his hand. When he had\r\ngot the surface of the wine level the glass was no longer perpendicular\r\nto the table.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I see what it is,\" he said, taking another sip and putting the\r\nglass down. \"You notice that, although the wine isn't lying straight in\r\nthe glass, it isn't moving about. It's just as still as it would be on\r\nearth. That means that our centre of gravity is not exactly in line with\r\nthe centre of the earth. We haven't quite swung into our proper\r\nposition, and that reminds me, dear. You will have to be prepared for\r\nsome rather curious experiences in that way. For instance, just see if\r\nthat jug of water is as heavy as it ought to be.\"\r\n\r\nShe took hold of the handle, and exerting, as she thought, just enough\r\nforce to lift the jug a few inches, was astonished to find herself\r\nholding it out at arm's length with scarcely any effort. She put it down\r\nagain very carefully as though she were afraid it would go floating off\r\nthe table, and said, looking rather scared:\r\n\r\n\"That's very strange, but I suppose it's all perfectly natural?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly; it merely means that we have left Mother Earth a good long\r\nway behind us.\"\r\n\r\n\"How far?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"I can't tell you exactly,\" he replied, \"until I go to the\r\ninstrument-room and take the angles, but I should say roughly about\r\nseventy thousand miles. When we've finished we'll go and have coffee on\r\nthe upper deck, and then we shall see something of the glories of Space\r\nas no human eyes have ever seen them before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seventy thousand miles away from home already, and we only started a\r\ncouple of hours ago!\" Zaidie found the idea a trifle terrifying, and\r\nfinished her meal almost in silence. When she got up she was not a\r\nlittle disconcerted when the effort she made not only took her off her\r\nchair but off her feet as well. She rose into the air nearly to the\r\nsurface of the table.\r\n\r\n\"Sakes!\" she said, \"this is getting quite a little embarrassing; I shall\r\nbe hitting my head against the roof next.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you'll soon get used to it,\" he laughed, pulling her down on to her\r\nfeet by the skirt of her dress; \"always remember to exert very little\r\nstrength in everything you do, and don't forget to do everything very\r\nslowly.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the coffee was made he carried the apparatus up into the\r\ndeck-chamber. Then he came back and said:\r\n\r\n\"You'd better wrap yourself up warmly. It's a good deal colder up there\r\nthan it is here.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she reached the deck and took a first glance about her, Zaidie\r\nseemed suddenly to lapse into a state of somnambulism.\r\n\r\nThe whole heavens above and around were strewn with thick clusters of\r\nstars which she had never seen before. The stars she remembered seeing\r\nfrom the earth were only pin-points in the darkness compared with the\r\nmyriads of blazing orbs which were now shooting their rays across the\r\nblack void of Space.\r\n\r\nSo many millions of new ones had come into view, that she looked in vain\r\nfor the familiar constellations. She saw only vast clusters of living\r\ngems of every colour crowding the heavens on every side of her.\r\n\r\nShe walked slowly round the deck, gazing to right and left and above,\r\nincapable for the moment either of thought or speech, but only of dumb\r\nwonder, mingled with a dim sense of overwhelming awe. Presently she\r\ncraned her neck backwards and looked straight up to the zenith. A huge\r\nsilver crescent, supporting, as it were, a dim greenish-coloured body in\r\nits arms, stretched overhead across nearly a sixth of the heavens.\r\n\r\nThen Redgrave came to her side, took her in his arms, lifted her as if\r\nshe had been a little child, and laid her in a long, low deck-chair, so\r\nthat she could look at it without inconvenience.\r\n\r\nThe splendid crescent seemed to be growing visibly bigger, and as she\r\nlay there in a trance of wonder and admiration she saw point after point\r\nof dazzling white light flash out in the dark portions, and then begin\r\nto send out rays as though they were gigantic volcanoes in full\r\neruption, and were pouring torrents of living fire from their blazing\r\ncraters.\r\n\r\n\"Sunrise on the Moon!\" said Redgrave, who had stretched himself on\r\nanother chair beside her. \"A glorious sight, isn't it? But nothing to\r\nwhat we shall see to-morrow morning--only there doesn't happen to be any\r\nmorning just about here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said dreamily, \"glorious, isn't it? That and all the\r\nstars--but I can't think anything yet, Lenox, it's all too mighty and\r\ntoo marvellous. It doesn't seem as though human eyes were meant to look\r\nupon things like this. But where's the earth? We must be able to see\r\nthat still.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not from here,\" he said, \"because it's underneath us. Come below now,\r\nand you shall see what I promised you.\"\r\n\r\nThey went down into the lower part of the vessel and to the after end\r\nbehind the engine-room. Redgrave switched on a couple of electric\r\nlights, and then pulled a lever attached to one of the side-walls. A\r\npart of the flooring about six feet square slid noiselessly away; then\r\nhe pulled another lever on the opposite side and a similar piece\r\ndisappeared, leaving a large space covered only by a thick plate of\r\nabsolutely transparent glass. He switched off the lights again and led\r\nher to the edge of it, and said:\r\n\r\n\"There is your native world, dear. That is your Mother Earth.\"\r\n\r\nWonderful as the moon had seemed, the gorgeous spectacle which lay\r\nseemingly at her feet was infinitely more magnificent. A vast disc of\r\nsilver grey, streaked and dotted with lines and points of dazzling\r\nlights, and more than half covered with vast, glimmering, greyish-green\r\nexpanses, seemed to form the floor of the tremendous gulf beneath them.\r\nThey were not yet too far away to make out the general features of the\r\ncontinents and oceans, and fortunately the hemisphere presented to them\r\nhappened to be singularly free from clouds.\r\n\r\nTo the right spread out the majestic outlines of the continents of North\r\nand South America, and to the left Asia, the Malay Archipelago, and\r\nAustralia. At the top was a vast, roughly circular area of dazzling\r\nwhiteness, and Redgrave, pointing to this, said:\r\n\r\n\"There, look up a little further north than the middle of that white\r\npatch, and you'll see what no eyes but yours and mine have ever\r\nseen--the North Pole! When we come back we shall see the South Pole,\r\nbecause we shall approach the earth from the other end, as it were.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you recognise a good deal of the picture. All that bright\r\npart up to the north, with the black spots on it, is Canada. The black\r\nspots are forests. That long white line to the left is the Rockies. You\r\nsee they're all bright at the north, and as you go south you only see a\r\nfew bright dots. Those are the snow-peaks.\r\n\r\n\"Those long thin white lines in South America are the tops of the Andes,\r\nand the big, dark patches to the right of them are the forests and\r\nplains of Brazil and the Argentine. Not a bad way of studying geography,\r\nis it? If we stopped here long enough we should see the whole earth spin\r\nright round under us, but we haven't time for that. We shall be in the\r\nmoon before it's morning in New York, but we shall probably get a\r\nglimpse of Europe to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nZaidie stood gazing for nearly an hour at this marvellous vision of the\r\nhome-world which she had left so far behind her before she could tear\r\nherself away and allow her husband to shut the slides again. The greatly\r\ndiminished weight of her body destroyed the fatigue of standing almost\r\nentirely. In fact, on board the _Astronef_ just then it was almost as\r\neasy to stand as it was to lie down.\r\n\r\nThere was of course very little sleep for the travellers on this first\r\nnight of their wonderful voyage, but towards the sixth hour after\r\nleaving the earth, Zaidie, overcome as much by the emotions which had\r\nbeen awakened within her as by physical fatigue, went to bed, after\r\nmaking her husband promise that he would wake her in good time to see\r\nthe descent upon the moon. Two hours later she was awake and drinking\r\nthe coffee which he had prepared for her. Then she went on to the upper\r\ndeck.\r\n\r\nTo her astonishment she found, on one hand, day more brilliant than she\r\nhad ever seen it before, and on the other hand darkness blacker than the\r\nblackest earthly night. On the right was an intensely brilliant orb,\r\nabout half as large again as the full moon seen from the earth, shining\r\nwith inconceivable brightness out of a sky black as midnight and\r\nthronged with stars. It was the Sun; the Sun shining in the midst of\r\nairless Space.\r\n\r\nThe tiny atmosphere enclosed in the glass-domed deck-space was lighted\r\nbrilliantly, but it was not perceptibly warmer, though Redgrave warned\r\nher not to touch anything upon which the sun's rays fell directly, as\r\nshe might find it uncomfortably hot. On the other side was the same\r\nblack immensity which she had seen the night before, an ocean of\r\ndarkness clustered with islands of light. High above in the zenith\r\nfloated the great silver-grey disc of earth, a good deal smaller now.\r\nBut there was another object beneath them which was at present of far\r\nmore interest to her.\r\n\r\nLooking down to the left, she saw a vast semi-luminous area in which not\r\na star was to be seen. It was the earth-lit portion of the long familiar\r\nand yet mysterious orb which was to be their resting place for the next\r\nfew hours.\r\n\r\n\"The sun hasn't risen over there yet,\" said Redgrave, as she was peering\r\ndown into the void. \"It's earth-light still. Now look at the other\r\nside.\"\r\n\r\nShe crossed the deck, and saw the strangest scene she had yet beheld.\r\nApparently only a few miles below her was a huge crescent-shaped plain\r\narching away for hundreds of miles on either side. The outer edge had a\r\nragged look, and little excrescences, which soon took the shape of\r\nflat-topped mountains, projected from it and stood out bright and sharp\r\nagainst the black void beneath, out of which the stars shone up, as it\r\nseemed, a few feet beyond the edge of the disc.\r\n\r\nThe plain itself was a scene of awful and utter desolation. Huge\r\nmountain-walls, towering to immense heights and enclosing great circular\r\nand oval plains, one side of them blazing with intolerable light, and\r\nthe other side black with impenetrable obscurity; enormous valleys\r\nreaching down from brilliant day into rayless night--perhaps down into\r\nthe very bowels of the dead world itself; vast grey-white plains lying\r\nround the mountains, crossed by little ridges and by long black lines,\r\nwhich could only be immense fissures with perpendicular sides--but all\r\nhard, grey-white and black, all intolerable brightness or inky gloom;\r\nnot a sign of life anywhere; no shady forests, no green fields, no\r\nbroad, glittering oceans; only a ghastly wilderness of dead mountains\r\nand dead plains.\r\n\r\n\"What an awful place,\" Zaidie whispered. \"Surely we can't land there.\r\nHow far are we from it?\"\r\n\r\n\"About fifteen hundred miles,\" replied Redgrave, who was sweeping the\r\nscene below him with one of the two powerful telescopes which stood on\r\nthe deck. \"No, it doesn't look very cheerful, does it? But it's a\r\nmarvellous sight for all that, and one that a good many people on earth\r\nwould give one of their eyes to see from here. I'm letting her drop\r\npretty fast, and we shall probably land in a couple of hours or so.\r\nMeanwhile you may as well get out your moon atlas, and study your\r\nlunography. I'm going to turn the power a bit astern so that we shall go\r\ndown obliquely, and see more of the lighted disc. We started at new moon\r\nso that you should have a look at the full earth, and also so that we\r\ncould get round to the invisible side while it is lighted up.\"\r\n\r\nThey both went below, he to deflect the repulsive force so that one set\r\nof engines should give them a somewhat oblique direction, while the\r\nother, acting directly on the surface of the moon, simply retarded their\r\nfall; and she to get out her maps.\r\n\r\nWhen they got back the _Astronef_ had changed her apparent position,\r\nand, instead of falling directly on to the moon, was descending towards\r\nit in a slanting direction. The result of this was that the sunlit\r\ncrescent rapidly grew in breadth. Peak after peak and range after range\r\nrose up swiftly out of the black gulf beyond. The sun climbed quickly up\r\nthrough the star-strewn, mid-day heavens, and the full earth sank more\r\nswiftly still behind them.\r\n\r\nAnother hour of silent, entranced wonder and admiration followed, and\r\nthen Redgrave said:\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think it's about time we were beginning to think of\r\nbreakfast, dear--or do you think you can wait till we land?\"\r\n\r\n\"Breakfast on the moon!\" she exclaimed. \"That would be just too lovely\r\nfor words--of course we'll wait!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" he said; \"you see that big black ring nearly below\r\nus?--that, as I suppose you know, is the celebrated Mount Tycho. I'll\r\ntry and find a convenient spot on the top of the ring to drop on, and\r\nthen you will be able to survey the scenery from seventeen or eighteen\r\nthousand feet above the plains.\"\r\n\r\nAbout two hours later a slight, jarring tremor ran through the frame of\r\nthe vessel, and the first stage of the voyage was ended. After a passage\r\nof less than twelve hours the _Astronef_ had crossed a gulf of nearly\r\ntwo hundred and fifty thousand miles, and rested on the untrodden\r\nsurface of the lunar world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well, Madame, we've arrived. This is the moon and there is the earth.\r\nTo put it into plain figures, you are now two hundred and forty thousand\r\nodd miles away from home. I think you said you would like breakfast on\r\nthe surface of the World that Has Been, and so, as it's about eleven\r\no'clock earth-time, we'll call it a _déjeuner_, and then we'll go and\r\nsee what this poor old skeleton of a world is like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, then we shan't actually have breakfast on the moon?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear child, of course you will. Isn't the _Astronef_ resting\r\nnow--right now as they say in some parts of the States--on the top of\r\nthe crater wall of Tycho? Aren't we really and actually on the surface\r\nof the moon? Just look at this frightful black and white, god-forsaken\r\nlandscape! Isn't it like everything that you've ever learnt about the\r\nmoon? Nothing but light and shade, black and white, peaks of mountains\r\nblazing in sunlight, and valleys underneath them as black as the hinges\r\nof----\"\r\n\r\n\"Tophet,\" said Zaidie, interrupting him quickly. \"Yes, I see what you\r\nmean. So we'll have our _déjeuner_ here, breathing our own nice\r\natmosphere, and eating and drinking what was grown on the soil of dear\r\nold Mother Earth. It's a wee bit paralysing to think of, isn't it, dear?\r\nTwo hundred and forty thousand miles across the gulf of Space--and we\r\nsitting here at our breakfast table just as comfortable as though we\r\nwere in the Cecil in London, or the Waldorf-Astoria in New York!\"\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing much in that, I mean as regards distance. You see,\r\nbefore we've finished we shall probably, at least I hope we shall, be\r\neating a breakfast or a dinner together a thousand million miles or more\r\nfrom New York or London. Your Ladyship must remember that this is only\r\nthe first stage on the journey, the jumping-off place as you called it.\r\nYou see the distance from Washington to New York is--well, it isn't even\r\na hop, skip and a jump in comparison with----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, I see what you mean of course, and so I suppose I had better\r\ncut off or short-circuit such sympathies with Mother Earth as are not\r\nconnected with your noble self, and get breakfast ready. How's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Lord Redgrave, looking at her as she rose from the table,\r\n\"I think our honeymoon in Space is young enough yet to make it possible\r\nfor me to say that your Ladyship's opinion is exactly right.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a hopeless commonplace! Really, Lenox, I thought you were\r\ncapable of something better than that.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Zaidie, it has been my fate to have many friends who have had\r\nhoneymoons on earth, and some of their experience seems to be that the\r\nman who contradicts his wife during the first six weeks of matrimony\r\nsimply makes an ass of himself. He offends her and makes himself\r\nunhappy, and it sometimes takes six months or more to get back to\r\nbearings.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a lot of silly men and women you must have known, Lenox. Is that\r\nthe way Englishmen start marriage in England? If it is, I don't wonder\r\nat Englishmen coming across the Atlantic in liners and air-ships and so\r\non to get American wives. I guess you can't understand your own\r\nwomenfolk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or perhaps they don't understand us; but anyhow, I don't think I've\r\nmade any great mistake.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't think you have. Of course if I thought so I wouldn't be\r\nhere now. But this is very well for a breakfast talk; all the same, I\r\nshould like to know how we are going to take the promenade you promised\r\nme on the surface of the moon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your Ladyship has only to finish her breakfast, and then everything\r\nshall be made plain to her, even the deepest craters of the mountains of\r\nthe moon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then, I will eat swiftly and in obedience; and meanwhile, as\r\nyour Lordship seems to have finished, perhaps----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I will go and see to the mechanical necessities,\" said Redgrave,\r\nswallowing his last cup of coffee, and getting up. \"If you'll come down\r\nto the lower deck when you've finished, I'll have your breathing-suit\r\nready for you, and then we'll go into the air-chamber.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, dear, yes,\" she said, putting out her hand to him as he left\r\nthe table, \"the ante-chamber to other worlds. Isn't it just lovely?\r\nFancy me being able to leave one world and land on another, and have you\r\nto say just those few words which make it all possible. I wonder what\r\nall the girls of all the civilised countries of earth would give just to\r\nbe me right now.\"\r\n\r\n\"They could none of them give what you gave me, Zaidie, because you see\r\nfrom my point of view there's only one Zaidie in the world--or as\r\nperhaps I ought to say just now, in the Solar System.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very prettily said, sir!\" she laughed, when she had given him his due\r\nreward for his courtly speech. \"I am too dazed with all these wonders\r\nabout me to----\"\r\n\r\n\"To reply to it? You've given me the most convincing reply possible. Now\r\nfinish your breakfast, and I'll tell you when the breathing-dresses and\r\nthe air-chamber are ready. By the way, don't forget your cameras. It's\r\nquite possible we may find something worth taking pictures of, and you\r\nneedn't trouble much about the weight. You know, you and I and all that\r\nwe carry will only weigh about a sixth of what we did on the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then, I'll take the whole-plate apparatus as well as the\r\nkodak and the panorama camera. When I'm ready, Murgatroyd will tell you\r\nto come down.\"\r\n\r\n\"But isn't he coming with us too?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear girl, if I were to ask Murgatroyd to leave the _Astronef_\r\nthere'd be a mutiny on board--a mutiny of one against one. No, he's left\r\nhis native world; but he says he's done it in a ship that's made with\r\nBritish steel out of English iron mines, smelted, forged and fashioned\r\nin English works, and so to him it's a bit of England, however far away\r\nfrom Mother Earth it may be; and if you ever see Andrew Murgatroyd's big\r\nhead and good, ungainly body outside the _Astronef_ in any of the\r\nworlds, dead or alive, that we're going to visit--well, when we get back\r\nto Mother Earth you may ask me----\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I'll have to ask you for anything, Lenox. I believe if I\r\nwanted anything you'd know before I did, so go away and get those\r\nbreathing-dresses ready. I didn't come to the moon to talk commonplaces\r\nwith a husband I've been married to for nearly three days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it really as long as that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't be ridiculous, even if you are beyond the limits of earthly\r\nconventionalities. Anyhow, I've been married long enough to want my own\r\nway, and just now I want a promenade on the moon.\"\r\n\r\n\"The will of her Ladyship is a law unto her servant, and that which she\r\nhath said shall be done! If you come down on to the lower deck in ten\r\nminutes everything shall be ready.\"\r\n\r\nWith this he disappeared down the companion-way.\r\n\r\nAbout five minutes afterwards Andrew Murgatroyd showed his grizzled,\r\nlong-bearded face with its high forehead, heavy brows, and broad-set\r\neyes, long nose and shaven upper lip, just above the stairway and said,\r\nfor all the world as though he might have been giving out the number of\r\nthe hymn in his beloved Ebenezer at Smeaton:\r\n\r\n\"If it pleases yer Ladyship, his Lordship is ready, and if you'll please\r\ncome down I'll show you the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, thank you, Mr. Murgatroyd!\" said Zaidie, getting up and going\r\ntowards the companion-way; \"but I'm afraid you don't think that--I mean\r\nyou don't seem to take very much interest----\"\r\n\r\n\"If your Ladyship will pardon me,\" said the old man, standing aside to\r\nlet her go down, \"it is not my business to think on board his Lordship's\r\nvessel. I am his servant, and my fathers have been his fathers' servants\r\nfor more years than I'd like to count. If it wasn't that way I wouldn't\r\nbe here. Will your Ladyship please to come down?\"\r\n\r\nZaidie bowed her beautiful head in recognition of this ages-old\r\ndevotion, and said as she passed him, more sweetly than he had ever\r\nheard human lips speak:\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Mr. Murgatroyd. You've taught me something in those few\r\nwords that we have no knowledge of in the States. Good service is as\r\nhonourable as good mastership. Thank you.\"\r\n\r\nMurgatroyd put up his lower lip and half smiled with his upper, for he\r\nwas not yet quite sure of this radiant beauty, who, according to his\r\nideas, should have been English and wasn't. Then, with a rather clumsy\r\nand yet eloquent gesture, he showed her the way down to the air-chamber.\r\n\r\nShe nodded to him with a smile as she passed in through the air-tight\r\ndoor, and when she heard the levers swing to and the bolts shoot into\r\ntheir places she felt as though, for the time being, she had said\r\ngoodbye to a friend.\r\n\r\nHer husband was waiting for her almost fully clad in his\r\nbreathing-dress. He had hers all ready to put on, and when the necessary\r\nchanges and investments had been made, Zaidie found herself clad in a\r\ncostume which was not by any means unlike the diving-dresses of common\r\nuse, save that they were very much lighter in construction.\r\n\r\nThe helmets were smaller, and not having to withstand outside pressure\r\nthey were made of welded aluminum, lined thickly with asbestos, not to\r\nkeep the cold out, but the heat in. On the back of the dress there was a\r\nsquare case, looking like a knapsack, containing the expanding\r\napparatus, which would furnish breathable air for an almost unlimited\r\ntime as long as the liquefied air from a cylinder hung below it passed\r\nthrough the cells in which the breathed air had been deprived of its\r\ncarbonic acid gas and other noxious ingredients.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of air inside the helmet automatically regulated the\r\nsupply, which was not permitted to circulate through the other portions\r\nof the dress. The reasons for this precaution were very simple. Granted\r\nthe absence of atmosphere on the moon, any air in the dress, which was\r\nwoven of a cunning compound of silk and asbestos, would instantly expand\r\nwith irresistible force, burst the covering, and expose the limbs of the\r\nexplorers to a cold which would be infinitely more destructive than the\r\nhottest of earthly fires. It would wither them to nothing in a moment.\r\n\r\nA human hand or foot--we won't say anything about faces--exposed to the\r\nsummer or winter temperature of the moon--that is to say, to its\r\nsunlight and its darkness--would be shrivelled into dry bone in a\r\nmoment, and therefore Lord Redgrave, foreseeing this, had provided the\r\nbreathing-dresses. Lastly, the two helmets were connected, for purposes\r\nof conversation, by a light wire, the two ends of which were connected\r\nwith a little telephonic receiver and transmitter inside each of the\r\nhead-dresses.\r\n\r\n\"Well, now I think we're ready,\" said Redgrave, putting his hand on the\r\nlever which opened the outer door.\r\n\r\nHis voice sounded a little queer and squeaky over the wire, and for the\r\nmatter of that so did Zaidie's as she replied:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'm ready, I think. I hope these things will work all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may be quite sure that I shouldn't have put _you_ into one of them\r\nif I hadn't tested them pretty thoroughly,\" he replied, swinging the\r\ndoor open and throwing out a light folding iron ladder which was hinged\r\nto the floor.\r\n\r\nThey were in the shade cast by the hull of the _Astronef_. For about ten\r\nyards in front of her Zaidie saw a dense black shadow, and beyond it a\r\nstretch of grey-white sand lit up by a glare of sunlight which would\r\nhave been intolerable if it had not been for the smoke-coloured slips of\r\nglass which had been fitted behind the glass visors of the helmets.\r\n\r\nOver it were thickly scattered boulders and pieces of rock bleached and\r\ndesiccated, and each throwing a black shadow, fantastically shaped and\r\nyet clearly defined on the grey-white sand behind it. There was no soil,\r\nand all the softer kind of rock and stone had crumbled away ages ago.\r\nEvery particle of moisture had long since evaporated; even chemical\r\ncombinations had been dissolved by the alternations of heat and cold\r\nknown only on earth to the chemist in his laboratory.\r\n\r\nOnly the hardest rocks, such as granites and basalts, remained.\r\nEverything else had been reduced to the universal grey-white impalpable\r\npowder into which Zaidie's shoes sank when she, holding her husband's\r\nhand, went down the ladder and stood at the foot of it--first of the\r\nearth-dwellers to set foot on another world.\r\n\r\nRedgrave followed her with a little spring from the centre of the ladder\r\nwhich landed him with strange gentleness beside her. He took both her\r\ngloved hands and pressed them hard in his. He would have kissed his\r\nwelcome to the World that Had Been if he could, but that of course was\r\nout of the question, and so he had to be content with telling her that\r\nhe wanted to.\r\n\r\nThen, hand in hand, they crossed the little plateau towards the edge of\r\nthe tremendous gulf, fifty-four miles across and nearly twenty thousand\r\nfeet deep, which forms the crater of Tycho. In the middle of it rose a\r\nconical mountain about five thousand feet high, the summit of which was\r\njust beginning to catch the solar rays. Half of the vast plain was\r\nalready brilliantly illuminated, but round the central cone was a\r\nsemicircle of shadow of impenetrable blackness.\r\n\r\n\"Day and night in this same valley, actually side by side!\" said Zaidie.\r\nThen she stopped and pointed down into the brightly lit distance, and\r\nwent on hurriedly, \"Look, Lenox; look at the foot of the mountain there!\r\nDoesn't that seem like the ruins of a city?\"\r\n\r\n\"It does,\" he said, \"and there's no reason why it shouldn't be. I've\r\nalways thought that, as the air and water disappeared from the upper\r\nparts of the moon, the inhabitants, whoever they were, must have been\r\ndriven down into the deeper parts. Shall we go down and see?\"\r\n\r\n\"But how?\" she said.\r\n\r\nHe pointed towards the _Astronef_. She nodded her helmeted head, and\r\nthey went back towards the vessel.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later the Space-Navigator had risen from her resting-place\r\nwith an impetus which rapidly carried her over half of the vast crater,\r\nand then she began to drop slowly into the depths. She grounded gently,\r\nand presently they were standing on the ground about a mile from the\r\ncentral cone. This time, however, Redgrave had taken the precaution to\r\nbring a magazine rifle and a couple of revolvers with him in case any\r\nstrange monsters, relics of the vanished fauna of the moon, might still\r\nbe taking refuge in these mysterious depths. Zaidie, although like a\r\ngood many American girls she could shoot excellently well, carried no\r\nweapon more offensive than the photographic apparatus aforesaid.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that Redgrave did when they stepped out on to the sandy\r\nsurface of the plain was to stoop down and strike a wax match. There was\r\na tiny glimmer of light, which was immediately extinguished.\r\n\r\n\"No air here,\" he said, \"so we shall find no living beings--at any rate,\r\nnone like ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nThey found the walking exceedingly easy, although their boots were\r\npurposely weighted in order to counteract, to some extent, the great\r\ndifference in gravity. A few minutes brought them to the outskirts of\r\nthe city. It had no walls and exhibited no signs of any devices for\r\ndefence. Its streets were broad and well-paved, and the houses, built of\r\ngreat blocks of grey stone joined together with white cement, looked as\r\nfresh and unworn as though they had only been built a few months,\r\nwhereas they had probably stood for hundreds of thousands of years. They\r\nwere flat-roofed, all of one storey and practically of one type.\r\n\r\nThere were very few public buildings, and absolutely no attempt at\r\nornamentation was visible. Round some of the houses were spaces which\r\nmight once have been gardens. In the midst of the city, which appeared\r\nto cover an area of about four square miles, was an enormous square\r\npaved with flag-stones, which were covered to the depth of a couple of\r\ninches with a light grey dust, which, as they walked across it, remained\r\nperfectly still save for the disturbance caused by their footsteps.\r\nThere was no air to support it, otherwise it might have risen in clouds\r\nabout them.\r\n\r\nFrom the centre of this square rose a huge pyramid nearly a thousand\r\nfeet in height, the sole building of the great silent city which\r\nappeared to have been raised most probably as a temple by the hands of\r\nits long-dead inhabitants.\r\n\r\nWhen they got nearer they saw a white fringe round the steps by which it\r\nwas approached, and they soon found that this fringe was composed of\r\nmillions of white-bleached bones and skulls, shaped very much like those\r\nof terrestrial men, save that they were very much larger, and that the\r\nribs were out of all proportion to the rest of the skeleton.\r\n\r\nThey stopped awe-stricken before this strange spectacle. Redgrave\r\nstooped down and took hold of one of the bones, a huge femur. It broke\r\nin two as he tried to lift it, and the piece which remained in his hand\r\ncrumbled instantly to white powder.\r\n\r\n\"Whoever they were,\" he said, \"they were giants. When air and water\r\nfailed above, they came down here by some means and built this city. You\r\nsee what enormous chests they must have had. That would be Nature's last\r\nstruggle to enable them to breathe the diminishing atmosphere. These, of\r\ncourse, were the last descendants of the fittest to breathe it; this was\r\ntheir temple, I suppose, and here they came to die--I wonder how many\r\nthousand years ago--perishing of heat, and cold, and hunger, and thirst;\r\nthe last tragedy of a race, which, after all, must have been something\r\nlike ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's just too awful for words,\" said Zaidie. \"Shall we go into the\r\ntemple? That seems one of the entrances up there, only I don't like\r\nwalking over all those bones.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't suppose they'll mind if we do,\" replied Redgrave, \"only we\r\nmustn't go far in. It may be full of cross passages and mazes, and we\r\nmight never get out. Our lamps won't be much use in there, you know, for\r\nthere's no air. They'll just be points of light, and we shan't see\r\nanything but them. It's very aggravating, but I'm afraid there's no help\r\nfor it. Come along.\"\r\n\r\nThey ascended the steps, crushing the bones and skulls to powder beneath\r\ntheir feet, and entered the huge, square doorway, which looked like a\r\nrectangle of blackness against the grey-white of the wall. Even through\r\ntheir asbestos-woven clothing they felt a sudden shock of icy cold. In\r\nthose few steps they had passed from a temperature of tenfold summer\r\nheat into one below that of the coldest spots on earth. They turned on\r\nthe electric lamps which were fitted to the breastplates of their\r\ndresses, but they could see nothing save the thin thread of light\r\nstraight in front of them. It did not even spread. It was like a\r\npolished needle on a background of black velvet.\r\n\r\nAll about them was darkness impenetrable, and so they reluctantly turned\r\nback to the doorway, leaving all the mysteries which that vast temple of\r\na long-vanished people might contain to remain mysteries to the end of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThey passed down the steps again and crossed the square, and for the\r\nnext half-hour Zaidie was busy taking photographs of the pyramid with\r\nits ghastly surroundings, and a few general views of this strange City\r\nof the Dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they got back they found Murgatroyd pacing up and down the floor of\r\nthe deck-chamber, looking about him with serious eyes, but betraying no\r\nother visible sign of anxiety. The _Astronef_ was at once his home and\r\nhis idol, and, as Redgrave had said, even his own direct orders would\r\nhardly have induced him to leave her even in a world in which there was\r\nnot a living human being to dispute possession of her.\r\n\r\nWhen they had resumed their ordinary clothing the _Astronef_ rose from\r\nthe surface of the plain, crossed the encircling wall at the height of a\r\nfew hundred feet, and made her way at a speed of about fifty miles an\r\nhour towards the regions of the South Pole.\r\n\r\nBehind them to the north-west they could see from their elevation of\r\nnearly thirty thousand feet the vast expanse of the Sea of Clouds.\r\nDotted here and there were the shining points and ridges of light\r\nmarking the peaks and crater-walls which the rays of the rising sun had\r\nalready touched. Before them and to the right and left rose a vast maze\r\nof ragged, splintery peaks and huge ramparts of mountain-walls enclosing\r\nplains so far below their summits that the light of neither sun nor\r\nearth ever reached them.\r\n\r\nBy directing the force exerted by what might now be called the\r\npropelling part of the engines against the mountain masses which they\r\ncrossed to right and left and behind, Redgrave was able to take a zigzag\r\ncourse that carried them over many of the walled plains which were\r\nwholly or partially lit up by the sun, and in nearly all of the deepest\r\ntheir telescopes revealed something like what they had found within the\r\ncrater of Tycho. At length, pointing to a gigantic circle of white light\r\nfringing an abyss of utter darkness, he said:\r\n\r\n\"There is Newton, the greatest mystery of the moon. Those inner walls\r\nare twenty-four thousand feet high; that means that the bottom, which\r\nhas never been seen by human eyes, is about five thousand feet below the\r\nsurface of the moon. What do you say, dear--shall we go down and see if\r\nthe searchlight will show us anything? You know there may be something\r\nlike breathable air down there, and perhaps living creatures who can\r\nbreathe it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly!\" replied Zaidie decisively; \"haven't we come to see things\r\nthat nobody else has ever seen?\"\r\n\r\nRedgrave went down to the engine-room, and presently the _Astronef_\r\nchanged her course, and in a few minutes was hanging with her polished\r\nhull bathed in sunlight, like a star suspended over the unfathomable\r\ngulf of darkness below.\r\n\r\nAs they sank below the level of the sun-rays, Murgatroyd turned on both\r\nthe searchlights. They dropped down ever slowly and more slowly until\r\ngradually the two long, thin streams of light began to spread themselves\r\nout; the lower they went the more the beams spread out, and by the time\r\nthe _Astronef_ came gently to a rest they were swinging round her in\r\nbroad fans of diffused light over a dark, marshy surface, with scattered\r\npatches of grey moss and reeds, with dull gleams of stagnant water\r\nshowing between them.\r\n\r\n\"Air and water at last! I thought so,\" said Redgrave, as he rejoined her\r\non the upper deck; \"air and water and eternal darkness! Well, we shall\r\nfind life on the moon here if anywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose we had better put on our breathing-dresses, hadn't we?\" asked\r\nZaidie.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" he replied, \"because, although there is some sort of air,\r\nwe don't know yet whether we shall be able to breathe it. It may be half\r\ncarbon-dioxide for all we know; but a few matches will soon tell us\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\nWithin a quarter of an hour they were again standing on the surface.\r\nMurgatroyd had orders to follow them as far as possible with the head\r\nsearchlight, which, in the comparatively rarefied atmosphere, appeared\r\nto have a range of several miles. Redgrave struck a match, and held it\r\nup level with his head; it burnt with a clear, steady, yellow flame.\r\n\r\n\"Where a match will burn a man should be able to breathe,\" he said. \"I'm\r\ngoing to see what lunar air is like.\"\r\n\r\n\"For Heaven's sake be careful, dear,\" came the reply in pleading tones\r\nacross the wire.\r\n\r\n\"All right; but don't open your helmet till I tell you.\"\r\n\r\nHe then raised the hermetically closed slide of glass, which formed the\r\nfront of the helmets, half an inch or so. Instantly he felt a sensation\r\nlike the drawing of a red-hot iron across his skin. He snapped the visor\r\ndown and clasped it in its place. For a moment or two he gasped for\r\nbreath, and then he said rather faintly:\r\n\r\n\"It's no good, it's too cold. It would freeze the blood of a salamander.\r\nI think we'd better go back and explore this place under cover. We can't\r\ndo anything in the dark, and we can see just as well from the upper deck\r\nwith the searchlights. Besides, as there's air and water here, there's\r\nno telling but there may be inhabitants of sorts such as we shouldn't\r\ncare to meet.\"\r\n\r\nHe took her hand, and to Murgatroyd's great relief they went back to the\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\nRedgrave then raised the _Astronef_ a couple of hundred feet and, by\r\ndirecting the repulsive force against the mountain walls, developed just\r\nsufficient energy to keep them moving at about twelve miles an hour.\r\n\r\nThey began to cross the plain with their searchlights flashing out in\r\nall directions. They had scarcely gone a mile before the head-light fell\r\nupon a moving form half walking, half crawling among some stunted\r\nbrown-leaved bushes by the side of a broad, stagnant stream.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" said Zaidie, clasping his arm, \"is that a gorilla, or--no, it\r\n_can't_ be a man.\"\r\n\r\nThe light was turned full upon the object. If it had been covered with\r\nhair it might have passed for some strange type of the ape tribe, but\r\nits skin was smooth and of a livid grey. Its lower limbs were evidently\r\nmore powerful than its upper; its chest was enormously developed, but\r\nthe stomach was small. The head was big and round and smooth. As they\r\ncame nearer they saw that in place of fingernails it had long white\r\nfeelers which it kept extended and constantly waving about as it groped\r\nits way towards the water. As the intense light flashed full on it, it\r\nturned its head towards them. It had a nose and a mouth--the nose, long\r\nand thick, with huge mobile nostrils; the mouth forming an angle\r\nsomething like a fish's lips. Teeth there seemed none. At either side of\r\nthe upper part of the nose there were two little sunken holes--in which\r\nthis thing's ancestors of countless thousands of years ago had once had\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nAs she looked upon this awful parody of what had once perhaps been a\r\nhuman face, Zaidie covered hers with her hands and uttered a little moan\r\nof horror.\r\n\r\n\"Horrible, isn't it?\" said Redgrave. \"I suppose that's what the last\r\nremnants of the Lunarians have come to. Evidently once men and women,\r\nsomething like ourselves. I daresay the ancestors of that thing have\r\nlived here in coldness and darkness for hundreds of generations. It\r\nshows how tremendously tenacious Nature is of life.\r\n\r\n\"Ages ago, no doubt, that brute's ancestors lived up yonder when there\r\nwere seas and rivers, fields and forests, just as we have them on earth,\r\namong men and women who could see and breathe and enjoy everything in\r\nlife and had built up civilisations like ours!\r\n\r\n\"Look, it's going to fish or something. Now we shall see what it feeds\r\non. I wonder why the water isn't frozen. I suppose there must be some\r\ninternal heat left still. A few patches with lakes of lava under them.\r\nPerhaps this valley is just over one, and that's why these creatures\r\nhave managed to survive.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! there's another of them, smaller, not so strongly formed. That\r\nthing's mate, I suppose--female of the species. Ugh! I wonder how many\r\nhundred of thousands of years it will take for _our_ descendants to come\r\nto that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope our dear old earth will hit something else and be smashed to\r\natoms before that happens!\" exclaimed Zaidie, whose curiosity had now\r\npartly overcome her horror. \"Look, it's trying to catch something!\"\r\n\r\nThe larger of the two creatures had groped its way to the edge of the\r\nsluggish, oily water and dropped, or rather rolled, quietly into it. It\r\nwas evidently cold-blooded, or nearly so, for no warm-blooded animal\r\nwould have taken to such water so naturally. Presently the other dropped\r\nin too, and both disappeared for some moments. Then, in the midst of a\r\nviolent commotion in the water a few yards away, they rose to the\r\nsurface of the water, the larger with a wriggling, eel-like fish between\r\nits jaws.\r\n\r\nThey both groped their way towards the edge, and had just reached it and\r\nwere pulling themselves out when a hideous shape rose out of the water\r\nbehind them. It was like the head of an octopus joined to the body of a\r\nboa-constrictor, but head and neck were both of the same ghastly, livid\r\ngrey as the other two creatures. It was evidently blind, too, for it\r\ntook no notice of the brilliant glare of the searchlight, but it moved\r\nrapidly towards the two scrambling forms, its long white feelers\r\ntrembling out in all directions. Then one of them touched the smaller of\r\nthe two shapes. Instantly the rest shot out and closed round it, and\r\nwith scarcely a struggle it was dragged beneath the water and vanished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A hideous shape rose out of the water behind them._]\r\n\r\nZaidie uttered a little low scream and covered her face again, and\r\nRedgrave said:\r\n\r\n\"The same old brutal law you see, life preying upon life even on a dying\r\nworld, a world that is more than half dead itself. Well, I think we've\r\nseen enough of this place. I suppose those are about the only types of\r\nlife we should meet anywhere, and I don't want to know much more about\r\nthem. I vote we go and see what the invisible hemisphere is like.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have had all I want of this side,\" said Zaidie, looking away from the\r\nscene of the hideous tragedy, \"so the sooner we go, the better I shall\r\nlike it.\"\r\n\r\nA few minutes later the _Astronef_ was again rising towards the stars\r\nwith her searchlights still flashing down into the Valley of Expiring\r\nLife, which had seemed to them even worse than the Valley of Death. As\r\nhe followed the rays with a pair of powerful field glasses, Redgrave\r\nfancied that he saw huge, dim shapes moving about the stunted shrubbery\r\nand through the slimy pools of the stagnant rivers, and once or twice he\r\ngot a glimpse of what might well have been the ruins of towns and\r\ncities, but the gloom soon became too deep and dense for the\r\nsearchlights to pierce and he was glad when the _Astronef_ soared up\r\ninto the brilliant sunlight once more. Even the ghastly wilderness of\r\nthe lunar landscape was welcome after the nameless horrors of that\r\nhideous abyss.\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of hours' rapid travelling, Redgrave pointed down to a\r\ncomparatively small, deep crater, and said:\r\n\r\n\"There, that is Malapert. It is almost exactly at the south pole of the\r\nmoon, and there,\" he went on, pointing ahead, \"is the horizon of the\r\nhemisphere which no earthborn eyes have ever seen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Except ours,\" said Zaidie somewhat inconsequently, \"and I wonder what\r\n_we_ shall see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably something very like what we have seen on this side,\" replied\r\nRedgrave, and as the event proved, he was right.\r\n\r\nContrary to many ingenious speculations which have been indulged in by\r\nboth scientist and romancer, they found that the hemisphere, which for\r\ncountless ages had never been turned towards the earth, was almost an\r\nexact replica of the visible one. Fully three-fourths of it was\r\nbrilliantly illuminated by the sun, and what they saw through their\r\nglasses was practically the same as what they had beheld on the\r\nearthward side; huge groups of enormous craters and ringed mountains,\r\nlong, irregular chains crowned with sharp, splintery peaks, and between\r\nthese vast, deeply depressed areas, ranging in colour from dazzling\r\nwhite to grey-brown, marking the beds of the vanished lunar seas.\r\n\r\nAs they crossed one of these, Redgrave allowed the _Astronef_ to sink to\r\nwithin a few thousand feet of the surface, and then he and Zaidie swept\r\nit with their telescopes. Their chance search was rewarded by something\r\nthey had not seen in the sea-beds of the other hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThese depressions were far deeper than the others, evidently many\r\nthousands of feet below the average surface, but the sun's rays were\r\nblazing full into this one, and, dotted round its slopes at varying\r\nelevations, they made out little patches which seemed to differ from the\r\ngeneral surface.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if those are the remains of cities,\" said Zaidie. \"Isn't it\r\npossible that the old peoples of the moon might have built their cities\r\nalong the seas just as we do, and that their descendants may have\r\nfollowed the waters as they retreated, I mean as they either dried up or\r\ndisappeared into the centre?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very probable indeed, dearest of philosophers,\" he said, picking her up\r\nwith one arm and kissing the smiling lips which had just uttered this\r\nmost reasonable deduction. \"Now we'll go down and see.\"\r\n\r\nHe diminished the vertically repulsive force a little, and the\r\n_Astronef_ dropped slantingly towards the bed of what might once have\r\nbeen the Pacific of the Moon.\r\n\r\nWhen they were within about a couple of thousand feet of the surface it\r\nbecame perfectly plain that Zaidie was correct in her hypothesis. The\r\nvast sea floor was thickly strewn with the ruins of countless cities and\r\ntowns, which had been inhabited by an equally countless series of\r\ngenerations of men and women, who had perhaps lived and loved in the\r\ndays when our own world was a glowing mass of molten rock, surrounded by\r\nthe envelope of vapours which has since condensed to form our oceans.\r\n\r\nThey dropped still lower and ran diagonally across the ocean-bed, and as\r\nthey did so Zaidie's proposition was more and more completely confirmed,\r\nfor they saw that the towns and cities which stood highest were the most\r\ndilapidated, and that the buildings had evidently been torn and crumbled\r\naway by the action of wind and water, snow and ice.\r\n\r\nThe nearer they approached to the central and deepest depression, the\r\nbetter preserved and the simpler the buildings became, until down in the\r\nlowest depths they found a collection of low-built square edifices,\r\nscarcely better than huts, which had clustered round the little lake\r\ninto which, ages before, the ocean had dwindled. But where the lake had\r\nbeen there was now only a shallow depression covered with grey sand and\r\nbrown rock.\r\n\r\nInto this they descended and touched the lunar surface for the last\r\ntime. A couple of hours' excursion among the houses proved that they had\r\nbeen the last refuge of the last descendants of a dying race, a race\r\nwhich had socially degenerated just as the succession of cities had done\r\narchitecturally, age by age, as the long-drawn struggle for mere\r\nexistence had become keener and keener until the two last essentials,\r\nair and water, had failed--and then the end had come.\r\n\r\nThe streets, like the square of the great Temple of Tycho, were strewn\r\nwith myriads and myriads of bones, and there were myriads more scattered\r\nround what had once been the shores of the dwindling lake. Here, as\r\nelsewhere, there was not a sign or a record of any kind--carving or\r\nsculpture. If there were any such on the surface of the moon they had\r\nnot discovered them. The buildings which they had seen evidently\r\nbelonged to the decadent period during which the dwindling remnants of\r\nthe Selenites asked only to eat and drink and breathe.\r\n\r\nInside the great Pyramid of the City of Tycho they might, perhaps, have\r\nfound something--some stone or tablet which bore the mark of the\r\nartist's hand; elsewhere, perhaps, they might have found cities reared\r\nby older races, which might have rivalled the creations of Egypt and\r\nBabylon, but they had neither time nor inclination to look for these.\r\n\r\nAll that they had seen of the Dead World had only sickened and saddened\r\nthem. The untravelled regions of Space peopled by living worlds more\r\nakin to their own were before them. The red disc of Mars was glowing in\r\nthe zenith among the diamond-white clusters which gemmed the black sky\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\nMore than a hundred millions of miles had to be traversed before they\r\nwould be able to set foot on his surface, and so, after one last look\r\nround the Valley of Death about them, Redgrave turned on the full energy\r\nof the repulsive force in a vertical direction, and the _Astronef_ leapt\r\nupwards in a straight line for her new destination. The Unknown\r\nHemisphere spread out in a vast plain beneath them, the blazing sun rose\r\non their left, and the brilliant silver orb of the earth on their right,\r\nand so, full of wonder and yet without regret, they bade farewell to the\r\nWorld that Had Been.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earth and the moon had been left more than a hundred million miles\r\nbehind in the depths of Space, and the _Astronef_ had crossed this\r\nimmense gap in eleven days and a few hours; but this apparently\r\ninconceivable speed was not altogether due to the powers of the\r\nSpace-Navigator, for her commander had taken advantage of the passage of\r\nthe planet along its orbit towards that of the earth. Hence, while the\r\n_Astronef_ was approaching Mars with ever-increasing speed, Mars was\r\ntravelling towards the _Astronef_ at the rate of sixteen miles a second.\r\n\r\nThe great silver disc of the earth had diminished until it looked only a\r\nlittle larger than Venus appears to human eyes. In fact the planet Terra\r\nis to the inhabitants of Mars what Venus is to us, the Star of the\r\nMorning and the Evening.\r\n\r\nBreakfast on the morning of the twelfth day--or, since there is neither\r\nday nor night in Space, it would be more correct to say the twelfth\r\nperiod of twenty-four earth-hours as measured by the chronometers--was\r\njust over, and Redgrave was standing with Zaidie in the forward end of\r\nthe deck-chamber, looking downwards at a vast crescent of rosy light\r\nwhich stretched out over an arc of more than ninety degrees. Two tiny\r\nblack spots were travelling towards each other across it.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" she said, going towards one of the telescopes, \"there are the\r\nmoons. I was reading my Gulliver last night. I wonder what the old Dean\r\nwould have given to be here, and see how true his guess was. Are we\r\ngoing to land on them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see why we shouldn't,\" he said. \"I think we might find them\r\nconvenient stopping places; besides, you know this isn't only a\r\npleasure-trip. We have to add as much as we can to the sum of human\r\nknowledge, and so of course we shall have to find out whether the moons\r\nof Mars have atmospheres and inhabitants.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, people living on those wee things!\" she laughed. \"Why they're\r\nonly about thirty or forty miles round, aren't they?\"\r\n\r\n\"About,\" he said, \"but then that's just one of the points I want to\r\nsolve; and as for life, it doesn't always mean people, you know. We are\r\nonly a few hundred miles away from Deimos, the outer one, and he is\r\ntwelve thousand five hundred miles from Mars. I vote we drop on him\r\nfirst and let him carry us towards Phobos. And then when we've examined\r\nhim we'll pay a visit to his brother and take a trip round Mars on him.\r\nPhobos does the journey in about seven hours and a half, and as he's\r\nonly three thousand seven hundred miles above the surface, we ought to\r\nget a very good view of our next stopping-place.\"\r\n\r\n\"That ought to be quite delightful,\" said Zaidie. \"But how commonplace\r\nyou are getting, Lenox. That's so like you Englishmen. We are doing what\r\nhas only been dreamt of before, and here you are talking about moons and\r\nplanets as if they were railway stations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if your Ladyship prefers it, we will call them undiscovered\r\nislands and continents in the Ocean of Space. That does sound a little\r\nbit better, doesn't it? Now I think I had better go down and see to my\r\nengines.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone, Zaidie sat down to the telescope again and kept it\r\nfocussed on one of the little black spots travelling across the crescent\r\nof Mars. Both it and the other spot rapidly grew larger, and the\r\nfeatures of the planet itself became more distinct. Soon even with her\r\nunaided eyes she could make out the seas and continents and the\r\nmysterious canals quite plainly through the clear, rosy atmosphere, and,\r\nwith the aid of the telescope, she could even see the glimmering\r\ntwilight which the inner moon threw upon the unlighted portion of the\r\nplanet's disc.\r\n\r\nDeimos grew bigger and bigger, and in about half an hour the _Astronef_\r\ngrounded gently on what looked to Zaidie like a dimly lighted circular\r\nplain, but which, when her eyes became accustomed to the light, was more\r\nlike the summit of a conical mountain. Redgrave raised the keel a little\r\nfrom the surface again and steered towards a thin circle of light on the\r\ntiny horizon.\r\n\r\nAs they crossed into the sunlit portion it became quite plain that\r\nDeimos, at any rate, was as airless and lifeless as the moon. The\r\nsurface was composed of brown rock and red sand broken up into miniature\r\nhills and valleys. There were a few traces of bygone volcanic action,\r\nbut it was evident that the internal fires of this tiny world must have\r\nburnt themselves out very quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Not much to be seen here,\" said Redgrave, as he came up the\r\ncompanion-way, \"and I don't think it would be safe to go out. The\r\nattraction is so weak here that we might find ourselves falling off with\r\nvery little exertion. Still, you may as well take a couple of\r\nphotographs of the surface, and then we'll be off to Phobos.\"\r\n\r\nZaidie got her apparatus to work, and when she had taken her slides down\r\nto the dark-room, Redgrave turned the R. Force on very slightly and\r\nPhobos began to sink away beneath them. The attraction of Mars now began\r\nto make itself strongly felt, and the _Astronef_ dropped rapidly through\r\nthe eight thousand miles which separate the inner and outer satellites.\r\n\r\nAs they approached Phobos they saw that half the little disc was\r\nbrilliantly lighted by the same rays of the sun which were glowing on\r\nthe rapidly increasing crescent of Mars beneath them. By careful\r\nmanipulation of his engines Redgrave managed to meet the approaching\r\nsatellite with a hardly perceptible shock about the centre of its\r\nlighted portion, that is to say the side turned towards the planet.\r\n\r\nMars now appeared as a gigantic rosy moon filling the whole vault of the\r\nheavens above them. Their telescopes brought the three thousand seven\r\nhundred and fifty miles down to about ten. The rapid motion of the tiny\r\nsatellite afforded them a spectacle which might be compared to the\r\nrising of a moon glowing with rosy light and hundreds of times larger\r\nthan the earth. The speed of the vehicle of which they had taken\r\npossession, something like four thousand two hundred miles an hour,\r\ncaused the surface of the planet to apparently sweep away from below\r\nthem, just as the earth seems to glide from under the car of a balloon.\r\n\r\nNeither of them left the telescopes for more than a few minutes during\r\nthis aerial circumnavigation. Murgatroyd, outwardly impassive, but\r\ninwardly filled with solemn fears for the fate of this impiously daring\r\nvoyage, brought them wine and sandwiches, and later on tea and toast and\r\nmore sandwiches; but they took no moment's heed of these, so absorbed\r\nwere they in the wonderful spectacle which was swiftly passing under\r\ntheir eyes.\r\n\r\nThe main armament of the _Astronef_ consisted of four pneumatic guns,\r\nwhich could be mounted on swivels, two ahead and two astern, which\r\ncarried a shell containing either one of two kinds of explosives\r\ninvented by her creator.\r\n\r\nOne of these was a solid, and burst on impact with an explosive force\r\nequal to about twenty pounds of lyddite. The other consisted of two\r\nliquids separated by a partition in the shell, and these, when mixed by\r\nthe breaking of the partition, burst into a volume of flame which could\r\nnot be extinguished by any known human means. It would burn even in a\r\nvacuum, since it supplied its own elements of combustion. The guns would\r\nthrow these shells to a distance of about seven terrestrial miles. On\r\nthe upper deck there were also stands for a couple of light machine guns\r\ncapable of discharging seven hundred explosive bullets a minute.\r\n\r\nProfessor Rennick, although a man of peace, had little sympathy with the\r\nlaws of \"civilised\" warfare which permit men to be blown into rags of\r\nflesh and splinters of bone by explosive shells of a pound weight and\r\nupward, and only allow projectiles of less weight to be used against\r\n\"savages.\" There was no humbug about him. He believed that when war\r\n_was_ necessary it had to _be_ war--and the sooner it was over the\r\nbetter for everybody concerned.\r\n\r\nThe small arms consisted of a couple of heavy ten-bore elephant guns\r\ncarrying three-ounce melinite shells; a dozen rifles and fowling-pieces\r\nof different makes of which three, a single and a double-barrelled rifle\r\nand a double-barrelled shot-gun, belonged to her Ladyship, as well as a\r\ndainty brace of revolvers, one of half a dozen braces of various\r\ncalibres which completed the minor armament of the _Astronef_.\r\n\r\nThe guns were got up and mounted while the attraction of the planet was\r\ncomparatively feeble, and the weapons themselves therefore of very\r\nlittle weight. On the surface of the earth a score of men could not have\r\ndone the work, but on board the _Astronef_, suspended in Space, her crew\r\nof three found the work easy. Zaidie herself picked up a Maxim and\r\ncarried it about as though it were a toy sewing-machine.\r\n\r\n\"Now I think we can go down,\" said Redgrave, when everything had been\r\nput in position as far as possible. \"I wonder whether we shall find the\r\natmosphere of Mars suitable for terrestrial lungs. It will be rather\r\nawkward if it isn't.\"\r\n\r\nA very slight exertion of repulsive force was sufficient to detach the\r\n_Astronef_ from the body of Phobos. She dropped rapidly towards the\r\nsurface of the planet, and within three hours they saw the sunlight, for\r\nthe first time since they had left the earth, shining through an\r\nunmistakable atmosphere, an atmosphere of a pale, rosy hue, instead of\r\nthe azure of the earthly skies. An angular observation showed that they\r\nwere within fifty miles of the surface of the undiscovered world.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we shall find air here of some sort, there's no doubt. We'll drop\r\na bit further and then Andrew shall start the propellers. They'll very\r\nsoon give us an idea of the density. Do you notice the change in the\r\ntemperature? That's the diffused rays instead of the direct ones. Twenty\r\nmiles! I think that will do. I'll stop her now and we'll prospect for a\r\nlanding place.\"\r\n\r\nHe went down to apply the repulsive force directly to the surface of\r\nMars, so as to check the descent, and then he put on his\r\nbreathing-dress, went into the exit-chamber, closed one door behind him,\r\nopened the other and allowed it to fill with Martian air; then he shut\r\nit again, opened his visor and took a cautious breath.\r\n\r\nIt may, perhaps, have been the idea that he, the first of all the sons\r\nof Earth, was breathing the air of another world, or it might have been\r\nsome property peculiar to the Martian atmosphere, but he immediately\r\nexperienced a sensation such as usually follows the drinking of a glass\r\nof champagne. He took another breath, and another, then he opened the\r\ninner door and went back to the lower deck, saying to himself: \"Well,\r\nthe air's all right if it is a bit champagney; rich in oxygen, I\r\nsuppose, with perhaps a trace of nitrous-oxide in it. Still, it's\r\ncertainly breathable, and that's the principal thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all right, dear,\" he said as he reached the upper deck where\r\nZaidie was walking about round the sides of the glass dome gazing with\r\nall her eyes at the strange scene of mingled cloud and sea and land\r\nwhich spread for an immense distance on all sides of them. \"I have\r\nbreathed the air of Mars, and even at this height it is distinctly\r\nwholesome, though of course it's rather thin, and I had it mixed with\r\nsome of our own atmosphere. Still I think it will agree all right with\r\nus lower down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" said Zaidie, \"suppose we get below those clouds and see\r\nwhat there really is to be seen.\"\r\n\r\n\"As there's a fairly big problem to be solved shortly I'll see to the\r\ndescent myself,\" he replied, going towards the stairway.\r\n\r\nIn a couple of minutes she saw the cloud-belt below them rising rapidly.\r\nWhen Redgrave returned the _Astronef_ was plunging into a sea of rosy\r\nmist.\r\n\r\n\"The clouds of Mars!\" she exclaimed. \"Fancy a world with pink clouds! I\r\nwonder what there is on the other side.\"\r\n\r\nThe next moment they saw. Just below them at a distance of about five\r\nearth-miles lay an irregularly triangular island, a detached portion of\r\nthe Continent of Huygens almost equally divided by the Martian Equator,\r\nand lying with another almost similarly shaped island between the\r\nfortieth and the fiftieth meridians of west longitude. The two islands\r\nwere divided by a broad, straight stretch of water about the width of\r\nthe English Channel between Folkestone and Boulogne. Instead of the\r\nbright blue-green of terrestrial seas, this connecting link between the\r\ngreat Northern and Southern Martian oceans had an orange tinge.\r\n\r\nThe land immediately beneath them was of a gently undulating character,\r\nsomething like the Downs of South-Eastern England. No mountains were\r\nvisible in any direction. The lower portions, particularly along the\r\nborders of the canals and the sea, were thickly dotted with towns and\r\ncities, apparently of enormous extent. To the north of the Island\r\nContinent there was a peninsula, which was covered with a vast\r\ncollection of buildings, which, with the broad streets and spacious\r\nsquares which divided them, must have covered an area of something like\r\ntwo hundred square miles.\r\n\r\n\"There's the London of Mars!\" said Redgrave, pointing down towards it;\r\n\"where the London of Earth will be in a few thousand years, close to the\r\nEquator. And, you see, all those other towns and cities are crowded\r\nround the canals! I daresay when we go across the northern and southern\r\ntemperate zones we shall find them in about the state that Siberia or\r\nAntarctica are in.\"\r\n\r\n\"I daresay we shall,\" replied Zaidie; \"Martian civilisation is crowding\r\ntowards the Equator, though I should call that place down there the\r\ngreater New York of Mars, and--see--there's Brooklyn just across the\r\ncanal. I wonder what they're thinking about us down there.\"\r\n\r\nPhobos revolves from west to east almost along the plane of its\r\nprimary's equator. To left and right they saw the huge ice-caps of the\r\nSouth and North Poles gleaming through the red atmosphere with a pale\r\nsunset glimmer. Then came the great stretches of sea, often obscured by\r\nvast banks of clouds, which, as the sunlight fell upon them, looked\r\nstrangely like earth-clouds at sunset.\r\n\r\nThen, almost immediately underneath them, spread out the great land\r\nareas of the equatorial region. The four continents of Halle, Galileo,\r\nand Tycholand; then Huygens--which is to Mars what Europe, Asia, and\r\nAfrica are to the Earth, then Herschell and Copernicus. Nearly all of\r\nthese land masses were split up into semi-regular divisions by the\r\nfamous canals which have so long puzzled terrestrial observers.\r\n\r\n\"Well, there is one problem solved at any rate,\" said Redgrave, when,\r\nafter a journey of nearly four hours, they had crossed the western\r\nhemisphere. \"Mars is getting very old, her seas are diminishing, and her\r\ncontinents are increasing. Those canals are the remains of gulfs and\r\nstraits which have been widened and deepened and lengthened by human, or\r\nI should say Martian, labour, partly, I've no doubt, for purposes of\r\nnavigation and partly to keep the inhabitants of the interior of the\r\ncontinents within measurable distance of the sea. There's not the\r\nslightest doubt about that. Then, you see, there are scarcely any\r\nmountains to speak of so far, only ranges of low hills.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that means, I suppose,\" said Zaidie, \"that they've all been worn\r\ndown as the mountains of the earth are being. I was reading Flammarion's\r\n'End of the World' last night, and he, you know, describes the earth at\r\nthe last as just one big plain of land, no hills or mountains, no seas,\r\nand only sluggish rivers draining into marshes.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose that is what they're coming to down yonder. Now, I wonder\r\nwhat sort of civilisation we shall find. Perhaps we shan't find any at\r\nall. Suppose all their civilisations have worn out and they are\r\ndegenerating into the same struggle for sheer existence those poor\r\ncreatures in the moon must have had.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or suppose,\" said Redgrave rather seriously, \"we find that they have\r\npassed the zenith of civilisation, and are dropping back into savagery,\r\nbut still have the use of weapons and means of destruction which we,\r\nperhaps, have no notion of, and are inclined to use them? We'd better be\r\ncareful, dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, Lenox?\" she said. \"They wouldn't try to do us any\r\nharm, would they? Why should they?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't say they would,\" he replied; \"but still you never know. You\r\nsee, their ideas of right and wrong and hospitality and all that sort of\r\nthing may be quite different to what we have on the earth. In fact, they\r\nmay not be men at all, but just a sort of monster with perhaps a\r\nsuperhuman intellect with all sorts of extra-human ideas in it.\r\n\r\n\"Then there's another thing,\" he went on. \"Suppose they fancied a trip\r\nthrough Space, and thought that they had as good a right to the\r\n_Astronef_ as we have? I daresay they've seen us by this time if they've\r\ngot telescopes, as no doubt they have, perhaps a good deal more powerful\r\nthan ours, and they may be getting ready to receive us now. I think I'll\r\nget the guns in place before we go down, in case their moral ideas, as\r\ndear old Hans Breitmann called them, are not quite the same as ours.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth before Zaidie, who still had her\r\nglasses to her eyes, and was looking down towards the great city whose\r\nglazed roofs were flashing with a thousand tints in the pale crimson\r\nsunlight, said with a little tremor in her voice:\r\n\r\n\"Look, Lenox, down there--don't you see something coming up? That little\r\nblack thing. Just look how fast it's coming up; it's quite distinct\r\nalready. It's a sort of flying-ship, only it has wings and, I think,\r\nmasts too. Yes, I can see three masts, and there's something glittering\r\non the tops of them. I wonder if they're coming to pay us a polite\r\nmorning call, or whether they're going to treat us like trespassers in\r\ntheir atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no telling, but those things on the top of the masts look like\r\nrevolving helices,\" replied Redgrave, after a long look through his\r\ntelescope. \"He's screwing himself up into the air. That shows that they\r\nmust either have stronger and lighter machinery than we have, or, as the\r\nastronomers have thought, this atmosphere is denser than ours, and\r\ntherefore easier to fly in. Then, of course, things are only half their\r\nearthly weight here.\r\n\r\n\"Well, whether it's peace or war, I suppose we may as well let them come\r\nand reconnoitre. Then we shall see what kind of creatures they are. Ah,\r\nthere are a lot more of them, some coming from Brooklyn, too, as you\r\ncall it. Come up into the conning-tower, and I'll relieve Murgatroyd, so\r\nthat he can go and look after his engines. We shall have to give these\r\ngentlemen a lesson in flying. Meanwhile, in case of accidents, we may as\r\nwell make ourselves as invulnerable as possible.\"\r\n\r\nA few minutes later they were in the conning-tower again, watching the\r\napproach of the Martian fleet through the thick windows of toughened\r\nglass which enabled them to look in every direction except straight\r\ndown. The steel coverings had been drawn down over the glass dome of the\r\ndeck-chamber, and Murgatroyd had gone down to the engine-room. Fifty\r\nfeet ahead of them stretched out the long, shining spur, of which ten\r\nfeet were solid steel, a ram which no floating structure built by human\r\nhands could have resisted.\r\n\r\nRedgrave was standing with his hand on the steering-wheel, looking more\r\nserious than he had done so far during the voyage. Zaidie stood beside\r\nhim with a powerful binocular telescope watching, with cheeks a little\r\npaler than usual, the movements of the Martian air-ships. She counted\r\ntwenty-five vessels rising round them in a wide circle.\r\n\r\n\"I don't like the idea of a whole fleet coming up,\" said Redgrave, as he\r\nwatched them rising, and the ring narrowing round the still motionless\r\n_Astronef_. \"If they only wanted to know who and what we are, or to\r\nleave their cards on us, as it were, and bid us welcome to the world,\r\none ship could have done that just as well as a fleet. This lot coming\r\nup looks as if they wanted to get round and capture us.\"\r\n\r\n\"It does look like it,\" said Zaidie, with her glasses fixed on the\r\nnearest of the vessels; \"and now I can see they've guns too, something\r\nlike ours, and perhaps, as you said just now, they may have explosives\r\nthat we don't know anything about. Oh, Lenox, suppose they were able to\r\nsmash us up with a single shot.\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't be afraid of that, dear,\" he said, putting his arm round\r\nher shoulders. \"Of course it's perfectly natural that they should look\r\nupon us with a certain amount of suspicion, dropping like this on them\r\nfrom the stars. Can you see anything like men on board them yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, they're all closed in just as we are,\" she replied; \"but they've\r\ngot conning-towers like this, and something like windows along the\r\nsides. That's where the guns are, and the guns are moving. They're\r\npointing them at us. Lenox, I'm afraid they're going to shoot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we may as well spoil their aim,\" he said, pressing one of the\r\nbuttons on the signal-board three times, and then once more after a\r\nlittle interval.\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the signal Murgatroyd turned on the repulsive force to\r\nhalf power, and the _Astronef_ leapt up vertically a couple of thousand\r\nfeet. Then Redgrave pressed the button once and she stopped. Another\r\nsignal set the propellers in motion, and as she sprang forward across\r\nthe circle formed by the Martian air-ships, they looked down and saw\r\nthat the place which they had just left was occupied by a thick\r\ngreenish-yellow cloud.\r\n\r\n\"Look, Lenox, what on earth is that?\" exclaimed Zaidie, pointing down to\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"What on Mars would be nearer the point, dear,\" he said, with what she\r\nthought a somewhat vicious laugh. \"That, I'm afraid, means anything but\r\na friendly reception for us. That cloud is one of two things--it's the\r\nsmoke of the explosion of twenty or thirty shells, or else it's made of\r\ngases intended to either poison us or make us insensible, so that they\r\ncan take possession of the ship. In either case I should say that the\r\nMartians are not what we should call gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think not,\" she said angrily. \"They might at least have taken\r\nus for friends till they had proved us enemies, which they wouldn't have\r\ndone. Nice sort of hospitality that, considering how far we've come, and\r\nwe can't shoot back, because we haven't got the ports open.\"\r\n\r\n\"And a very good thing too!\" laughed Redgrave; \"if we had had them open,\r\nand that volley had caught us unawares, the _Astronef_ would probably\r\nhave been full of poisonous gases by this time, and your honeymoon,\r\ndear, would have come to a somewhat untimely end. Ah, they're trying to\r\nfollow us! Well, now we'll see how high they can fly.\"\r\n\r\nHe sent another signal to Murgatroyd, and the _Astronef_, still beating\r\nthe Martian air with the fans of her propellers, and travelling forward\r\nat about fifty miles an hour, rose in a slanting direction through a\r\ndense bank of rosy-tinted clouds, which hung over the bigger of the two\r\ncities--New York, as Zaidie had named it.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the golden-red sunlight above it the _Astronef_\r\nstopped her ascent, and then, with half a turn of the steering-wheel,\r\nher commander sent her sweeping round in a wide circle. A few minutes\r\nlater they saw the Martian fleet rise almost simultaneously through the\r\nclouds. They seemed to hesitate a moment, and then the prow of every\r\nvessel was directed towards the swiftly moving _Astronef_.\r\n\r\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" said Redgrave, \"you evidently don't know anything\r\nabout Professor Rennick and the R. Force; and yet you ought to know that\r\nwe couldn't have come through Space without being able to get beyond\r\nthis little atmosphere of yours. Now let us see how fast you can fly.\"\r\n\r\nAnother signal went down to Murgatroyd, the whirling propellers became\r\ntwo intersecting circles of light. The speed of the _Astronef_ increased\r\nto a hundred-and-fifty miles an hour, and the Martian fleet began to\r\ndrop behind and trail out into a triangle like a flock of huge birds.\r\n\r\n\"That's lovely; we're leaving them!\" exclaimed Zaidie, leaning forward\r\nwith the glasses to her eyes and tapping the floor of the conning-tower\r\nwith her foot as if she wanted to dance, \"and their wings are working\r\nfaster than ever. They don't seem to have any screws.\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably because they've solved the problem of bird's flight,\" said\r\nRedgrave. \"They're not gaining on us, are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, they're at about the same distance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we'll see how they can soar.\"\r\n\r\nAnother signal went down the tube. The _Astronef's_ propellers slowed\r\ndown and stopped, and the vessel began to rise swiftly towards the\r\nzenith, which the sun was now approaching. The Martian fleet continued\r\nthe impossible chase until the limits of the navigable atmosphere, about\r\neight earth-miles above the surface, was reached. Here the air was\r\nevidently too rarefied for their wings to act upon. They came to a\r\nstandstill, looking like links of a broken chain, their occupants no\r\ndoubt looking up with envious eyes upon the shining body of the\r\n_Astronef_ glittering like a tiny star in the sunlight ten thousand feet\r\nabove them.\r\n\r\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" said Redgrave, after a swift glance round, \"I think\r\nwe have shown you that we can fly faster and soar higher than you can.\r\nPerhaps you'll be a bit more civil now. If you're not we shall have to\r\nteach you manners.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you're not going to fight them all, dear, are you? Don't let us be\r\nthe first to bring war and bloodshed with us into another world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't trouble about that, little woman, it's here already,\" he replied,\r\na trifle savagely. \"People don't have air-ships and guns which fire\r\nshells or poison-bombs, or whatever they were, without knowing what war\r\nis. From what I've seen, I should say these Martians have civilised\r\nthemselves out of all emotions, and, I daresay, have fought pitilessly\r\nfor the possession of the last habitable lands of the planet.\r\n\r\n\"They've preyed upon each other till only the fittest are left, and\r\nthose, I suppose, were the ones who invented the air-ships and finally\r\ngot possession of all that was worth having. Of course that would give\r\nthem the command of the planet, land and sea. In fact, if we are able to\r\nmake the personal acquaintance of the Martians, we shall probably find\r\nthem a set of over-civilised savages.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a rather striking paradox, isn't it, dear?\" said Zaidie,\r\nslipping her hand through his arm; \"but still it's not at all bad. You\r\nmean, of course, that they may have civilised themselves out of all the\r\nemotions until they're just a set of cold, calculating, scientific\r\nanimals. After all they must be something of the sort, for I'm quite\r\nsure we should not have done anything like that on earth if we'd had a\r\nvisitor from Mars. We shouldn't have got out cannons and shot at him\r\nbefore we'd even made his acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\"Now, if he, or they, had dropped in America as we were going down\r\nthere, we should have received them with deputations, given them\r\nbanquets, which they might not have been able to eat, and speeches,\r\nwhich they would not understand, and photographed them, and filled the\r\nnewspapers with everything that we could imagine about them, and then\r\nput them in a palace car and hustled them round the country for\r\neverybody to look at.\"\r\n\r\n\"And meanwhile,\" laughed Redgrave, \"some of your smart engineers, I\r\nsuppose, would have gone over the vessel they had come in, found out how\r\nshe was worked, and taken out a dozen patents for her machinery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely,\" replied Zaidie, with a saucy little toss of her chin;\r\n\"and why not? We like to learn things down there--and anyhow that would\r\nbe much more really civilised than shooting at them.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this little conversation was going on, the _Astronef_ was dropping\r\nrapidly into the midst of the Martian fleet, which had again arranged\r\nitself in a circle. Zaidie soon made out through her glasses that the\r\nguns were pointed upwards.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's your little game, is it!\" said Redgrave, when she had told\r\nhim of this. \"Well, if you want a fight, you can have it.\"\r\n\r\nAs he said this, his jaws came together, and Zaidie saw a look in his\r\neyes that she had never seen there before. He signalled rapidly two or\r\nthree times to Murgatroyd. The propellers began to whirl at their utmost\r\nspeed, and the _Astronef_, making a spiral downward course, swooped down\r\non to the Martian fleet with terrific velocity. Her last curve coincided\r\nalmost exactly with the circle occupied by the ships. Half-a-dozen\r\nspouts of greenish flame came from the nearest vessel, and for a moment\r\nthe _Astronef_ was enveloped in a yellow mist.\r\n\r\n\"Evidently they don't know that we are air-tight, and they don't use\r\nshot or shell. They've got past that. Their projectiles kill by poison\r\nor suffocation. I daresay a volley like that would kill a regiment. Now\r\nI'll give that fellow a lesson which he won't live to remember.\"\r\n\r\nThey swept through the poison-mist. Redgrave swung the wheel round. The\r\n_Astronef_ dropped to the level of the ring of Martian vessels, which\r\nhad now got up speed again. Her steel ram was directed straight at the\r\nvessel which had fired the last shot. Propelled at a speed of nearly two\r\nhundred miles an hour, it took the strange-winged craft amidships. As\r\nthe shock came, Redgrave put his arm round Zaidie's waist and held her\r\nclose to him, otherwise she would have been flung against the forward\r\nwall of the conning-tower.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _It took the strange-winged craft amidships._]\r\n\r\nThe Martian vessel stopped and bent up. They saw human figures more than\r\nhalf as large again as men inside her staring at them through the\r\nwindows in the sides. There were others at the breaches of the guns in\r\nthe act of turning the muzzles on the _Astronef_; but this was only a\r\nmomentary glimpse, for in a second the _Astronef's_ spur had pierced\r\nher, the Martian air-ship broke in twain, and her two halves plunged\r\ndownwards through the rosy clouds.\r\n\r\n\"Keep her at full speed, Andrew,\" said Redgrave down the speaking-tube,\r\n\"and stand by to jump if we want to.\"\r\n\r\n\"All ready, my Lord!\" came back up the tube.\r\n\r\nThe old Yorkshireman during the last few minutes had undergone a\r\ntransformation which he himself hardly understood. He recognised that\r\nthere was a fight going on, that it was a case of \"burn, sink and\r\ndestroy,\" and the thousand-year-old Berserker awoke in him just, as a\r\nmatter of fact, it had done in his lordship.\r\n\r\n\"They can pick up the pieces down there, what there is left of them,\"\r\nsaid Redgrave, still holding Zaidie tight to his side with one hand and\r\nworking the wheel with the other, \"and now we'll teach them another\r\nlesson.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do, dear?\" she said, looking up at him with\r\nsomewhat frightened eyes.\r\n\r\n\"You'll see in a moment,\" he said, between his shut teeth. \"I don't care\r\nwhether these Martians are degenerate human beings or only animals; but\r\nfrom my point of view the reception they have given us justifies any\r\nkind of retaliation. If we'd had a single port-hole open during the\r\nfirst volley you and I would have been dead by this time, and I'm not\r\ngoing to stand anything like that without reprisals. They've declared\r\nwar on us, and killing in war isn't murder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, no, I suppose not,\" she said; \"but it's the first fight I've been\r\nin, and I don't like it. Still, they did receive us pretty meanly,\r\ndidn't they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Meanly? If there was anything like a code of interplanetary morals or\r\nmanners one might call it absolutely caddish. I don't believe even Stead\r\nhimself could stand that--unless, of course, he wasn't here.\"\r\n\r\nHe sent another message to Murgatroyd. The _Astronef_ sprang a thousand\r\nfeet towards the zenith; another touch on the button, and she stopped\r\nexactly over the biggest of the Martian air-ships; another, and she\r\ndropped on to it like a stone and smashed it to fragments. Then she\r\nstopped and mounted again above the broken circle of the fleet, while\r\nthe pieces of the air-ship and what was left of her crew plunged\r\ndownwards through the crimson clouds in a fall of nearly thirty thousand\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nWithin the next few moments the rest of the Martian fleet had followed\r\nit, sinking rapidly down through the clouds and scattering in all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\n\"They seem to have had enough of it,\" laughed Redgrave, as the\r\n_Astronef_, in obedience to another signal, began to drop towards the\r\nsurface of Mars. \"Now we'll go down and see if they're in a more\r\nreasonable frame of mind. At any rate we've won our first scrimmage,\r\ndear.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it was rather brutal, Lenox, wasn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"When you are dealing with brutes, little woman, it is sometimes\r\nnecessary to be brutal.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you look a wee bit brutal right now,\" she replied, looking up at\r\nhim with something like a look of fear in her eyes. \"I suppose that is\r\nbecause you have just killed somebody--or somethings--whichever they\r\nare.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do I, really?\"\r\n\r\nThe hard-set jaw relaxed and his lips melted into a smile under his\r\nmoustache, and he bent down and kissed her.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do you suppose I should have thought of them if _you_ had\r\nhad a whiff of that poison?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear,\" she whispered in between the kisses, \"I see now.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Astronef_ dropped swiftly down through the crimson-tinged clouds,\r\nand a few minutes later they saw that the rest of the fleet had\r\nscattered in units in all directions, apparently with the intention of\r\ngetting as far as possible out of reach of that terrible ram. Only one\r\nof them, the largest, which carried what looked like a flag of woven\r\ngold at the top of its centre mast, remained in sight after a few\r\nminutes. It was almost immediately below them when they had passed\r\nthrough the clouds, and they could see it sinking straight down towards\r\nthe centre of what appeared to be the principal square of the bigger of\r\nthe two cities which Zaidie had named New York and Brooklyn.\r\n\r\n\"That fellow has gone to report, evidently,\" said Redgrave. \"We'll\r\nfollow him just to see what he's up to, but I don't think we'd better\r\nopen the ports even then. There's no telling when they might give us a\r\nwhiff of that poison-mist, or whatever it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how are you going to talk to them, then, if they can talk?--I mean,\r\nif they know any language that we do?\"\r\n\r\n\"They're something like men, and so I suppose they understand the\r\nlanguage of signs, at any rate. Still, if you don't fancy it, we'll go\r\nsomewhere else.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, thanks,\" she said. \"That's not my father's daughter. I haven't come\r\na hundred million miles from home to go away before the first act's\r\nfinished. We'll go down to see if we can make them understand.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the _Astronef_ was hanging suspended over an enormous\r\nsquare about half the size of Hyde Park. It was laid out just as a\r\nterrestrial park would be, in grass land, flower-beds, and avenues, and\r\npatches of trees, only the grass was a reddish yellow, the leaves of the\r\ntrees were like those of a beech in autumn, and the flowers were nearly\r\nall a deep violet, or a bright emerald green.\r\n\r\nAs they descended they saw that the square, or Central Park, as Zaidie\r\nat once christened it, was flanked by enormous blocks of buildings,\r\npalaces built of a dazzlingly white stone, and topped by domed roofs and\r\nlofty cupolas of glass.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't that just lovely!\" she said, swinging her binoculars in every\r\ndirection. \"Talk about your Park Lane and the houses round Central Park;\r\nwhy, it's the Chicago Exposition, and the Paris one, and your Crystal\r\nPalace, multiplied by about ten thousand, and all spread out just round\r\nthis one place. If we don't find these people nice, I guess we'd better\r\ngo back and build a fleet like this, and come and take it.\"\r\n\r\n\"There spoke the new American imperialism,\" laughed Redgrave. \"Well,\r\nwe'll go and see what they're like first, shall we?\"\r\n\r\nThe _Astronef_ dropped a little more slowly than the air-ship had done,\r\nand remained suspended a hundred feet or so above her after she had\r\nreached the ground. Swarms of human figures but of more than human\r\nstature, clad in tunics and trousers or knickerbockers, came out of the\r\nglass-domed palaces from all sides into the park. They were nearly all\r\nof the same stature, and there appeared to be no difference whatever\r\nbetween the sexes. Their dress was absolutely plain; there was no\r\nattempt at ornament or decoration of any kind.\r\n\r\n\"If there are any of the Martian women among those people,\" said her\r\nladyship, \"they've taken to rationals, and they've grown about as big as\r\nthe men.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's exactly what's happening on earth, you know, dear. I don't mean\r\nabout the rationals, but the women growing up, especially in America. I\r\ncome of a pretty long family----but, look!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I only come to your ear,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"And our descendants of ten thousand years hence----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't bother about them!\" she said. \"Look; there's some one who\r\nseems to want to communicate with us. Why, they're all bald! They\r\nhaven't got a hair among them--and what a size their heads are!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's brains--too much brains, in fact. These people have lived too\r\nlong. I daresay they've ceased to be animals--civilised themselves out\r\nof everything in the way of passions and emotions, and are just purely\r\nintellectual beings, with as much human nature about them as Russian\r\ndiplomacy or those things we saw at the bottom of the Newton Crater. I\r\ndon't like the look of them.\"\r\n\r\nThe orderly swarms of figures, which were rapidly filling the park,\r\ndivided as he was speaking, making a broad lane from one of its\r\nentrances to where the _Astronef_ was hanging above the air-ship. A\r\nlight four-wheeled vehicle, whose framework and wheels glittered like\r\nburnished gold, sped towards them, driven by some invisible agency.\r\n\r\nIts only occupant was a huge man, dressed in the universal costume,\r\nsaving only a scarlet sash in place of the cord-girdle which the others\r\nwore round their waists. The vehicle stopped near the air-ship, over\r\nwhich the _Astronef_ was hanging, and, as the figure dismounted, a door\r\nopened in the side of the vessel and three other figures, similar both\r\nin stature and attire, came out and entered into conversation with him.\r\n\r\n\"The Admiral of the Fleet is evidently making his report,\" said\r\nRedgrave. \"Meanwhile, the crowd seems to be taking a considerable amount\r\nof interest in us.\"\r\n\r\n\"And very naturally, too!\" replied Zaidie. \"Don't you think we might go\r\ndown now and see if we can make ourselves understood in any way? You can\r\nhave the guns ready in case of accidents, but I don't think they'll try\r\nand hurt us now. Look, the gentleman with the red sash is making signs.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we can go down now all right,\" replied Redgrave, \"because it's\r\nquite certain they can't use the poison-guns on us without killing\r\nthemselves as well. Still, we may as well have our own ready. Andrew,\r\nget that port Maxim ready. I hope we shan't want it, but we may. I don't\r\nquite like the look of these people.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're very ugly, aren't they?\" said Zaidie; \"and really you can't\r\ntell which are men and which are women. I suppose they've civilised\r\nthemselves out of everything that's nice, and are just scientific and\r\nutilitarian and everything that's horrid.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't wonder. They look to me as if they've just got common\r\nsense, as we call it, and hadn't any other sense; but, at any rate, if\r\nthey don't behave themselves, we shall be able to teach them manners of\r\na sort, though we may possibly have done that to some extent already.\"\r\n\r\nAs he said this Redgrave went into the conning-tower, and the _Astronef_\r\nmoved from above the air-ship, and dropped gently into the crimson grass\r\nabout a hundred feet from her. Then the ports were opened, the guns,\r\nwhich Murgatroyd had loaded, were swung into position, and they armed\r\nthemselves with a brace of revolvers each, in case of accident.\r\n\r\n\"What delicious air this is!\" said her ladyship, as the ports were\r\nopened and she took her first breath of the Martian atmosphere. \"It's\r\never so much nicer than ours. Oh, Lenox, it's just like breathing\r\nchampagne.\"\r\n\r\nRedgrave looked at her with an admiration which was tempered by a sudden\r\napprehension. Even in his eyes she had never seemed so lovely before.\r\nHer cheeks were glowing and her eyes were gleaming with a brightness\r\nthat was almost feverish, and he was himself sensible of a strange\r\nfeeling of exultation, both mental and physical, as his lungs filled\r\nwith the Martian air.\r\n\r\n\"Oxygen,\" he said, shortly, \"and too much of it! Or I shouldn't wonder\r\nif it was something like nitrous-oxide--you know, laughing gas.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't!\" she laughed; \"it may be very nice to breathe, but it reminds\r\none of other things which aren't a bit nice. Still, if it is anything of\r\nthat sort it might account for these people having lived so fast. I know\r\nI feel just now as if I was living at the rate of thirty-six hours a\r\nday, and so, I suppose, the fewer hours we stop here the better.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly!\" said Redgrave, with another glance of apprehension at her.\r\n\"Now, there's his Royal Highness, or whatever he is, coming. How are we\r\ngoing to talk to him? Are you all ready, Andrew?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my Lord, all ready,\" replied the old Yorkshireman, dropping his\r\nhuge, hairy hand on the breech of the Maxim.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then, shoot the moment you see them doing anything\r\nsuspicious, and don't let any one except his Royal Highness come nearer\r\nthan a hundred yards.\"\r\n\r\nAs he said this Redgrave went to the door, from which the gangway steps\r\nhad been lowered, and, in reply to a singularly expressive gesture from\r\nthe huge Martian, who seemed to stand nearly nine feet high, he beckoned\r\nto him to come up on to the deck.\r\n\r\nAs he mounted the steps the crowd closed round the _Astronef_ and the\r\nMartian air-ship; but, as though in obedience to orders which had\r\nalready been given, they kept at a respectful distance of a little over\r\na hundred yards away from the strange vessel which had wrought such\r\nhavoc with their fleet. When the Martian reached the deck, Redgrave held\r\nout his hand and the giant recoiled, as a man on earth might have done\r\nif, instead of the open palm, he had seen a clenched hand gripping a\r\nknife.\r\n\r\n\"Take care, Lenox,\" exclaimed Zaidie, taking a couple of steps towards\r\nhim, with her right hand on the butt of one of her revolvers. The\r\nmovement brought her close to the open door, and in full view of the\r\ncrowd outside.\r\n\r\nIf a seraph had come on earth and presented itself thus before a throng\r\nof human beings, there might have happened some such miracle as was\r\nwrought when the swarm of Martians beheld the strange beauty of this\r\nradiant daughter of the earth.\r\n\r\nAs it seemed to the space-voyagers, when they discussed it afterwards,\r\nages of purely utilitarian civilisation had brought all conditions of\r\nMartian life up--or down--to the same level. There was no apparent\r\ndifference between the males and females in stature; their faces were\r\nall the same, with features of mathematical regularity, pale skin,\r\nbloodless cheeks, and an expression, if such it could be called, utterly\r\ndevoid of emotion.\r\n\r\nBut still these creatures were human, or at least their forefathers had\r\nbeen. Hearts beat in their breasts, blood of a sort still flowed through\r\ntheir veins, and so the magic of this marvellous vision instantly awoke\r\nthe long-slumbering elementary instincts of a bygone age. A low murmur\r\nran through the vast throng, a murmur half-human, half-brutish, which\r\nswiftly rose to a hoarse screaming roar.\r\n\r\n\"Look out, my Lord! Quick! Shut the door, they're coming! It's her\r\nladyship they want; she must look like an angel from Heaven to them.\r\nShall I fire?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Redgrave, gripping the lever, and bringing the door down.\r\n\"Zaidie, if this fellow moves put a bullet through him. I'm going to\r\ntalk to that air-ship before he gets his poison-guns to work.\"\r\n\r\nAs the last word left his lips Murgatroyd put his thumb on the spring on\r\nthe Maxim. A roar such as Martian ears had never heard before resounded\r\nthrough the vast square, and was flung back with a thousand echoes from\r\nthe walls of the huge palaces on every side. A stream of smoke and flame\r\npoured out of the little port-hole, and then the onward-swarming throng\r\nseemed to stop, and the front ranks of it began to sink down silently in\r\nlong rows.\r\n\r\nThen through the roaring rattle of the Maxim sounded the deep, sharp\r\nbang of Redgrave's gun, as he sent ten pounds weight of Rennickite, as\r\nhe had christened it, into the Martian air-ship. There was the roar of\r\nan explosion which shook the air for miles around. A blaze of greenish\r\nflame and a huge cloud of steamy smoke showed that the projectile had\r\ndone its work, and, when the smoke drifted away, the spot on which the\r\nair-ship had lain was only a deep, red, jagged gash in the ground. There\r\nwas not even a fragment of the ship to be seen.\r\n\r\nThis done, Redgrave went and turned the starboard Maxim on to another\r\nswarm which was approaching the _Astronef_ from that side. When he had\r\ngot the range he swung the gun slowly from side to side. The moving\r\nthrong stopped, as the other one had done, and sank down to the red\r\ngrass, now dyed with a deeper red.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Zaidie had been holding the Martian at something more than\r\narm's length with her revolver. He seemed to understand perfectly that,\r\nif she pulled the trigger, the revolver would do something like what the\r\nMaxims had done. He appeared to take no notice whatever either of the\r\ndestruction of the air-ship or of the slaughter that was going on around\r\nthe _Astronef_. His big, pale blue eyes were fixed upon her face. They\r\nseemed to be devouring a loveliness such as they had never seen before.\r\nA dim, pinky flush stole for the first time into his waxy cheeks, and\r\nsomething like a light of human passion came into his eyes.\r\n\r\nThen, to the utter astonishment of both Redgrave and Zaidie, he said\r\nslowly and deliberately, and with only just enough tinge of emotion in\r\nhis voice to make Redgrave want to shoot him:\r\n\r\n\"Beautiful. Perfect. More perfect than ours. I want it. Give Palace and\r\nGarden of Eternal Summer for it. Two thousand work-slaves and fifty----\"\r\n\r\n\"And I'll see you damned first, sir, whoever you are!\" said Redgrave,\r\nclapping his hand on to the butt of his revolver, and forgetting for the\r\nmoment that he was speaking in another world than his own. \"What the\r\ndevil do you mean, sir, by insulting my wife----?\"\r\n\r\n\"Insulting. Wife. What is that? We have no words like those.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you speak English,\" exclaimed Zaidie, going a little nearer to him,\r\nbut still keeping the muzzle of her revolver pointing up to his hairless\r\nhead. \"No, Lenox, don't be afraid about me, and don't get angry. Can't\r\nyou see that this person hasn't got any temper? I suppose it was\r\ncivilised out of his ancestors ages ago. He doesn't know what a wife or\r\nan insult is. He just looks upon me as a desirable piece of property to\r\nbe bought, and I daresay he offered you a very handsome price. Now,\r\ndon't look so savage, because you know bargains like that have been made\r\neven on our dear old virtuous Mother Earth. For instance, if you hadn't\r\nmet us in the middle of the Atlantic----\"\r\n\r\n\"That'll do, Zaidie,\" Redgrave interrupted almost roughly. \"That's not\r\nexactly the question, but I see what you mean, and it was a bit silly of\r\nme to get angry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Silly? Angry? What do those words mean?\" said the Martian in his slow,\r\npassionless, mechanical voice. \"Who are you? Whence come you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll answer the last part first,\" said Redgrave. \"We come from the\r\nearth, the planet which you see after sunset and before sunrise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the Silver Star,\" said the Martian without any note of wonder or\r\nsurprise in his voice. \"Are all the dwellers there like the gods and\r\nangels our children read about in the old legends?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gods and angels!\" laughed Zaidie. \"There, Lenox, there's a compliment\r\nfor you. I really think we ought to be as civil to his Royal Highness\r\nafter that as possible.\" Then she went on, addressing the Martian, \"No,\r\nwe are not all gods and angels on earth. There are no gods and very few\r\nangels. In fact there are none except those which exist in the fancy of\r\ncertain prejudiced persons. But that doesn't matter, at least not just\r\nnow,\" she continued with American directness. \"What we want to know just\r\nnow is, why you speak English, and what sort of a world this Mars is?\"\r\n\r\nThe Martian evidently only understood the most direct essentials of her\r\nspeech. He saw that she asked two questions, and he answered them.\r\n\r\n\"Speak English?\" he replied, with a little shake of his huge head. \"We\r\nknow not English, but there is no other speech. There is only ours.\r\nCycles ago there were other speeches here, but those who spoke them were\r\nkilled. It was inconvenient. One speech for a world is best.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see what he means,\" said Redgrave, looking towards Zaidie. \"The\r\nMartian people have developed along practically the same lines as we are\r\ndoing, but they have done it faster and got a long way ahead of us. We\r\nare finding out that the speech we call English is the shortest and most\r\nconvenient. The Martians found it out long ago and killed everybody who\r\nspoke anything else. After all, what we call speech is only the\r\ntranslation of thoughts into sounds. These people have been thinking for\r\nages with the same sort of brains as ours, and they've translated their\r\nthoughts into the same sounds. What we call English they, I daresay,\r\ncall Martian, and that's all there is in it that I can see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" laughed Zaidie. \"Wonderful until you know how, eh? Like\r\nmost things. Still I must say that our friend here speaks English\r\nsomething like a phonograph, and if he'll excuse me saying so, which of\r\ncourse he will, he doesn't seem to have much more human nature about\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not quite so sure on that point,\" said Redgrave, \"but----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, never mind about that now!\" she interrupted, and then, turning\r\ntowards the Martian, who had been listening intently as though he was\r\ntrying to make sense out of what they had been saying, she went on\r\nspeaking slowly and very plainly----\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, sir, if you please, do you know what 'angry' means? Are you\r\nnot angry with us for destroying your air-ships up there in the clouds,\r\nand the one that came down, and for shooting all those people of yours?\"\r\n\r\nThe Martian looked at her with a little light in his big blue eyes, and\r\ntwo faint little spots of red just under them, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Anger! Yes, I remember, that is what we called brain-heat. Our teachers\r\nfound it to be madness and it was abolished. It was not convenient. The\r\nair-ships were not convenient to you, so you abolished them. The folk,\r\ntoo, that you abolished with those things,\" pointing to the guns, \"they\r\nwere not convenient. If you hadn't done that they would have abolished\r\nyou. There is no more to say.\"\r\n\r\n\"What brutes,\" said Zaidie, turning away from him, her head thrown back\r\nand her lips curling in unutterable disgust. \"Well, if these people have\r\ncivilised themselves along the same lines that we are doing, thinking\r\nthe same things and speaking something like the same speech, thank God\r\nwe shall be dead before our civilisation reaches a stage like this.\r\nThat's not a man. It's only a machine of flesh and bone and nerves, and\r\nI suppose it has blood of some sort.\"\r\n\r\nA beautiful woman always looks most beautiful when she is just a little\r\nangry. Redgrave had never seen Zaidie look quite so lovely as she did\r\njust then. The Martian, whose ancestors had for generations forgotten\r\nwhat human emotion was like, only saw in her anger a miracle which made\r\nher a thousand times more beautiful than before, and as he looked upon\r\nher glowing cheeks and gleaming eyes some instinct insensibly\r\ntransmitted through many generations awoke to sudden life in some unused\r\ncorner of his brain.\r\n\r\nHis pale clear eyes lit up with something like a glow of human passion.\r\nThe pink spots under his eyes spread downwards over his cheeks. Some\r\nhalf-articulate sounds came from between his thin lips. Then they were\r\ndrawn back and showed his smooth, toothless gums. He took a couple of\r\nlong, swift strides towards her, and then bent forward, towering over\r\nher with long, outstretched arms, huge, hideous, and half-human.\r\n\r\nZaidie sprang backwards as he came towards her, her right hand went up,\r\nand, just as Redgrave levelled his revolver, and Murgatroyd, true to the\r\nold Berserk instinct, took a rifle by the barrel and swung the stock\r\nabove his head, Zaidie pulled her trigger. The bullet cut a clean hole\r\nthrough the smooth, hairless skull of the Martian. A dark, red spot came\r\njust between his eyes, his huge frame shrank together and collapsed in a\r\nheap on the deck.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I've killed him! God forgive me, killed a man!\" she whispered, as\r\nher hand fell to her side, and the revolver dropped from her fingers.\r\n\"But, Lenox, do you really think it was a man?\"\r\n\r\n\"That thing a man!\" he replied between his clenched teeth. \"He wanted\r\nyou, and spoke English of a sort, so there was something human about\r\nhim, but anyhow he's better dead. Here, Andrew, open that door again and\r\nhelp me to heave this thing overboard. Then I think we'd better be off\r\nbefore we have the rest of the fleet with their poison guns round us.\r\nZaidie, I think you'd better go to your room for the present. Take a nip\r\nof cognac and then lie down, and mind you keep the door tight shut.\r\nThere's no telling what these animals might do if they had a chance, and\r\njust now it's my business and Andrew's to see that they don't.\"\r\n\r\nThough she would much rather have remained on deck to see anything more\r\nthat might happen, she saw that he was really in earnest, and so like a\r\nwise wife who commands by obeying, she obeyed, and went below.\r\n\r\nThen the dead body of the Martian was tumbled out of the side door. The\r\nwindows through which the guns had been fired were hermetically closed,\r\nand a few minutes later the _Astronef_ vanished from the surface of\r\nMars, to remain a memory and a marvel to the dwindling generations of\r\nthe worn-out world which is as this may be in the far-off days that are\r\nto come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\n\"How very different Venus looks now to what it does from the earth,\"\r\nsaid Zaidie, a couple of mornings later, by earth-time, as she took her\r\neye away from the telescope through which she had been examining an\r\nenormous golden crescent which spanned the dark vault of Space ahead of\r\nand slightly below the _Astronef_.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Redgrave, \"she looks----\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know that she is a she?\" said Zaidie, getting up and laying\r\na hand on his shoulder as he sat at his own telescope. \"Of course I know\r\nwhat you mean, that according to our own ideas on earth, it is the\r\nplanet or the world which has been supposed for ages to, as it were,\r\nshine upon the lovers of earth with the light reflected from\r\nthe--the--well, I suppose you know what I mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seeing that you are the most perfect terrestrial incarnation of the\r\nsaid goddess that I have seen yet,\" he replied, slipping his arm round\r\nher waist and pulling her down on to his knees, \"I don't think that that\r\nis quite the view you ought to take. Surely if Venus ever had a\r\ndaughter----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nonsense! After we've travelled all these millions of miles\r\ntogether do you really expect me to believe stuff like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear girl-graduate,\" he said, tightening his grip round her waist a\r\nlittle, \"you know perfectly well that if we had travelled beyond the\r\nlimits of the Solar System, if we had outsailed old Halley's Comet\r\nitself, and dived into the uttermost depths of Space outside the Milky\r\nWay, you and I would still be a man and a woman, and, being, as may be\r\npresumed, more or less in love with each other----\"\r\n\r\n\"Less indeed!\" said Zaidie; \"you're speaking for yourself, I hope.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then when she had partially disengaged herself and sat up straight,\r\nshe said between her laughs----\r\n\r\n\"Really, Lenox, you're quite absurd for a person who has been married as\r\nlong as you have, I don't mean in time, but in Space. Was it a thousand\r\nyears or a couple of hundred million miles ago that we were married?\r\nReally I am getting my ideas of time and space quite mixed up.\r\n\r\n\"But never mind that! What I was going to say is that, according to all\r\nthe authorities which your girl-graduate has been reading since we left\r\nMars, Venus--oh, doesn't she look just gorgeous, and our old friend the\r\nSun behind there blazing out of darkness like one of the furnaces at\r\nPittsburg--I beg your pardon, Lenox, I'm afraid I'm getting quite\r\nprovincial. I suppose we're considerably more than a hundred million\r\nmiles away?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear; we're about a hundred and fifty millions, and at that\r\ndistance, if you'll excuse me saying so, even the United States would\r\nseem almost like a province, wouldn't they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes; that's just where distance doesn't lend enchantment to the\r\nview, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what was it you were going to say before that----\"\r\n\r\n\"The interlude, eh? Well, before the interlude you were accusing me of\r\nbeing a graduate as well as a girl. Of course I can't help that, but\r\nwhat I was going to say was----\"\r\n\r\n\"If you are going to talk science, dear, perhaps we'd better sit on\r\ndifferent chairs. I may have been married for a hundred and fifty\r\nmillion miles, but the honeymoon isn't half way through yet, you know.\"\r\n\r\nThen there was another interlude of a few seconds' duration. When Zaidie\r\nwas seated beside her own telescope again, she said, after another\r\nglance at the splendid crescent which, as the _Astronef_ approached at a\r\nspeed of over forty miles a second, increased in size and distinctness\r\nevery moment:\r\n\r\n\"What I mean is this. All the authorities are agreed that on Venus, her\r\naxis of revolution being so very much inclined to the plane of her\r\norbit, the seasons are so severe that half the year its temperate zone\r\nand its tropics have a summer about twice as hot as ours and the other\r\nhalf they have a winter twice as cold as our coldest. I'm afraid, after\r\nall, we shall find the Love-Star a world of salamanders and seals;\r\nthings that can live in a furnace and bask on an iceberg; and when we\r\nget back home it will be our painful duty, as the first explorers of the\r\nfields of Space, to dispel another dearly-cherished popular delusion.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not so very sure about that,\" said Lenox, glancing from the rapidly\r\ngrowing crescent, to the sweet, smiling face beside him. \"Don't you see\r\nsomething very different there to what we saw either on the Moon or\r\nMars? Now just go back to your telescope and let us take an\r\nobservation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Zaidie, rising, \"as our trip is, partly at least, in the\r\ninterests of science, I will;\" and then when she had got her own\r\ntelescope into focus again--for the distance between the _Astronef_ and\r\nthe new world they were about to visit was rapidly lessening--she took a\r\nlong look through it, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think I see what you mean. The outer edge of the crescent is\r\nbright, but it gets greyer and dimmer towards the inside of the curve.\r\nOf course Venus has an atmosphere. So had Mars; but this must be very\r\ndense. There's a sort of halo all round it. Just fancy that splendid\r\nthing being the little black spot we saw going across the face of the\r\nSun a few days ago! It makes one feel rather small, doesn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is one of the things which a woman says when she doesn't want to\r\nbe answered; but, apart from that, you were saying----\"\r\n\r\n\"What a very unpleasant person you can be when you like! I was going to\r\nsay that on the Moon we saw nothing but black and white, light and\r\ndarkness. There was no atmosphere, except in those awful places I don't\r\nwant to think about. Then, as we got near Mars, we saw a pinky\r\natmosphere, but not very dense; but this, you see, is a sort of\r\npearl-grey white shading from silver to black. You notice how much paler\r\nit grows as we get nearer. But look--what are those tiny bright spots?\r\nThere are hundreds of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you remember as we were leaving the Earth, how bright the mountain\r\nranges looked; how plainly we could see the Rockies and the Andes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, I see; they're mountains; thirty-seven miles high, some of\r\nthem, they say; and the rest of the silver-grey will be clouds, I\r\nsuppose. Fancy living under clouds like those.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only another case of the adaptation of life to natural conditions, I\r\nexpect. When we get there I daresay we shall find that these clouds are\r\njust what make it possible for the inhabitants of Venus to stand the\r\nextremes of heat and cold. Given elevations three or four times as high\r\nas the Himalayas, it would be quite possible for them to choose their\r\ntemperature by shifting their altitude.\r\n\r\n\"But I think it's about time to drop theory and see to the practice,\" he\r\ncontinued, getting up from his chair and going to the signal board in\r\nthe conning-tower. \"Whatever the planet Venus may be like, we don't want\r\nto charge it at the rate of sixty miles a second. That's about the speed\r\nnow, considering how fast she's travelling towards us.\"\r\n\r\n\"And considering that, whether it is a nice world or not it's nearly as\r\nbig as the Earth, I guess we should get rather the worst of the charge,\"\r\nlaughed Zaidie as she went back to her telescope.\r\n\r\nRedgrave sent a signal down to Murgatroyd to reverse engines, as it\r\nwere, or, in other words, to direct the \"R. Force\" against the planet,\r\nfrom which they were now only a couple of hundred thousand miles\r\ndistant. The next moment the sun and stars seemed to halt in their\r\ncourses. The great golden-grey crescent, which had been increasing in\r\nsize every moment, appeared to remain stationary, and then, when he was\r\nsatisfied that the engines were developing the Force properly, he sent\r\nanother signal down, and the _Astronef_ began to descend.\r\n\r\nThe half-disc of Venus seemed to fall below them, and in a few minutes\r\nthey could see it from the upper deck spreading out like a huge\r\nsemi-circular plain of light ahead and on both sides of them. The\r\n_Astronef_ was falling at the rate of about a thousand miles a minute\r\ntowards the centre of the half-crescent, and every moment the brilliant\r\nspots above the cloud-surface grew in size and brightness.\r\n\r\n\"I believe the theory about the enormous height of the mountains of\r\nVenus must be correct after all,\" said Redgrave, tearing himself with an\r\nevident wrench away from his telescope. \"Those white patches can't be\r\nanything else but the summits of snow-capped mountains. You know how\r\nbrilliantly white a snow-peak looks on earth against the whitest of\r\nclouds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Zaidie, \"I've often seen that in the Rockies. But it's\r\nlunch-time, and I must go down and see how my things in the kitchen are\r\ngetting on. I suppose you'll try and land somewhere where it's morning,\r\nso that we can have a good day before us. Really, it's very convenient\r\nto be able to make your own morning or night as you like, isn't it? I\r\nhope it won't make us too conceited when we get back, being able to\r\nchoose our mornings and our evenings; in fact, our sunrises and sunsets\r\non any world we like to visit in a casual way like this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" laughed Redgrave, as she moved away towards the companion\r\nstairs, \"after all, if you find the United States, or even the Planet\r\nTerra, too small for you, we've always got the fields of Space open to\r\nus. We might take a trip across the Zodiac or down the Milky Way.\"\r\n\r\n\"And meanwhile,\" she replied, stopping at the top of the stairs and\r\nlooking round, \"I'll go down and get lunch. You and I may be king and\r\nqueen of the realms of Space, and all that sort of thing, but we've got\r\nto eat and drink, after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that reminds me,\" said Redgrave, getting up and following her, \"we\r\nmust celebrate our arrival on a new world as usual. I'll go down and get\r\nout the wine. I shouldn't be surprised if we found the people of the\r\nLove-World living on nectar and ambrosia, and as fizz is our nearest\r\napproach to nectar----\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" said Zaidie, as she gathered up her skirts and stepped\r\ndaintily down the companion stairs, \"if you find anything human, or at\r\nleast human enough to eat and drink, you'll have a party and give them\r\nchampagne. I wonder what those wretches on Mars would have thought of it\r\nif we'd only made friends with them?\"\r\n\r\nLunch on board the _Astronef_ was about the pleasantest meal of the day.\r\nOf course, there was neither day nor night, in the ordinary sense of the\r\nword, except as the hours were measured off by the chronometers.\r\nWhichever side or end of the vessel received the direct rays of the sun,\r\nwas bathed in blazing heat and dazzling light. Elsewhere there was black\r\ndarkness and the more than icy cold of Space; but lunch was a convenient\r\ndivision of the waking hours, which began with a stroll on the upper\r\ndeck and a view of the ever-varying splendours about them, and ended\r\nafter dinner in the same place with coffee and cigarettes and\r\nspeculations as to the next day's happenings.\r\n\r\nThis lunch-hour passed even more pleasantly and rapidly than others had\r\ndone, for the discussion as to the possibilities of Venus was continued\r\nin a quite delightful mixture of scientific disquisition and that\r\nconverse which is common to most human beings on their honeymoon.\r\n\r\nAs there was nothing more to be done or seen for an hour or two, the\r\nafternoon was spent in a pleasant siesta in the luxurious deck-saloon;\r\nbecause evening to them would be morning on that portion of Venus to\r\nwhich they were directing their course, and, as Zaidie said, when she\r\nsubsided into her hammock:\r\n\r\nIt would be breakfast-time before they could get dinner.\r\n\r\nAs the _Astronef_ fell with ever-increasing velocity towards the\r\ncloud-covered surface of Venus, the remainder of her disc, lit up by the\r\nradiance of her sister-worlds, Mercury, Mars, and the Earth, and also by\r\nthe pale radiance of an enormous comet, which had suddenly shot into\r\nview from behind its southern limb, became more or less visible.\r\n\r\nTowards six o'clock it became necessary to exert nearly the whole\r\nstrength of her engines to check the velocity of her fall. By eight she\r\nhad entered the atmosphere of Venus, and was dropping slowly towards a\r\nvast sea of sunlit cloud, out of which, on all sides, towered thousands\r\nof snow-clad peaks, rounded summits, and widespread stretches of upland\r\nabout which the clouds swept and surged like the silent billows of some\r\nvast ocean in Ghostland.\r\n\r\n\"I thought so!\" said Redgrave, when the propellers had begun to revolve\r\nand Murgatroyd had taken his place in the conning-tower. \"A very dense\r\natmosphere loaded with clouds. There's the Sun just rising, so your\r\nladyship's wishes are duly obeyed.\"\r\n\r\n\"And doesn't it seem nice and homelike to see him rising through an\r\natmosphere above the clouds again? It doesn't look a bit like the same\r\nsort of dear old Sun just blazing like a red-hot Moon among a lot of\r\nwhite-hot stars and planets. Look, aren't those peaks lovely, and that\r\ncloud-sea?--why, for all the world we might be in a balloon above the\r\nRockies or the Alps. And see,\" she continued, pointing to one of the\r\nthermometers fixed outside the glass dome which covered the upper deck,\r\n\"it's only sixty-five even here. I wonder if we can breathe this air,\r\nand--oh--I do wonder what we shall see on the other side of those\r\nclouds.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall have both questions answered in a few minutes,\" replied\r\nRedgrave, going towards the conning-tower. \"To begin with, I think we'll\r\nland on that big snow-dome yonder, and do a little exploring. Where\r\nthere are snow and clouds there is moisture, and where there is moisture\r\na man ought to be able to breathe.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Snow peaks and cloud seas._]\r\n\r\nThe _Astronef_, still falling, but now easily under the command of the\r\nhelmsman, shot forwards and downwards towards a vast dome of snow which,\r\nrising some two thousand feet above the cloud-sea, shone with dazzling\r\nbrilliance in the light of the rising Sun. She landed just above the\r\nedge of the clouds. Meanwhile they had put on their breathing-suits, and\r\nRedgrave had seen that the air chamber through which they had to pass\r\nfrom their own little world into the new ones that they visited was in\r\nworking order. When the outer door was opened and the ladder lowered he\r\nstood aside, as he had done on the Moon, and Zaidie's was the first\r\nhuman foot which made an imprint on the virgin snows of Venus.\r\n\r\nThe first thing Redgrave did was to raise the visor of his helmet and\r\ntaste the air of the new world. It was cool, and fresh, and sweet, and\r\nthe first draught of it sent the blood tingling and dancing through his\r\nveins. Perfect as the arrangements of the _Astronef_ were in this\r\nrespect, the air of Venus tasted like clear running spring water would\r\nhave done to a man who had been drinking filtered water for several\r\ndays. He threw the visor right up and motioned to Zaidie to do the same.\r\nShe obeyed, and, after drawing a long breath, she said:\r\n\r\n\"That's glorious! It's like wine after water, and rather stagnant water\r\ntoo. But what a world, snow-peaks and cloud-seas, islands of ice and\r\nsnow in an ocean of mist! Just look at them! Did you ever see anything\r\nso lovely and unearthly in your life? I wonder how high this mountain\r\nis, and what there is on the other side of the clouds. Isn't the air\r\ndelicious! Not a bit too cold after all--but, still, I think we may as\r\nwell go back and put on something more becoming. I shouldn't quite like\r\nthe ladies of Venus to see me dressed like a diver.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come along, then,\" laughed Lenox, as he turned back towards the vessel.\r\n\"That's just like a woman. You're about a hundred and fifty million\r\nmiles away from Broadway or Regent Street. You are standing on the top\r\nof a snow mountain above the clouds of Venus, and the moment that you\r\nfind the air is fit to breathe you begin thinking about dress. How do\r\nyou know that the inhabitants of Venus, if there are any, dress at all?\"\r\n\r\n\"What nonsense! Of course they do--at least, if they are anything like\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as they got back on board the _Astronef_ and had taken their\r\nbreathing-dresses off, Redgrave and the old engineer, who appeared to\r\ntake no visible interest in their new surroundings, threw open all the\r\nsliding doors on the upper and lower decks so that the vessel might be\r\nthoroughly ventilated by the fresh sweet air. Then a gentle repulsion\r\nwas applied to the huge snow mass on which the _Astronef_ rested. She\r\nrose a couple of hundred feet, her propellers began to whirl round, and\r\nRedgrave steered her out towards the centre of the vast cloud-sea which\r\nwas almost surrounded by a thousand glittering peaks of ice and domes of\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\n\"I think we may as well put off dinner, or breakfast as it will be now,\r\nuntil we see what the world below is like,\" he said to Zaidie, who was\r\nstanding beside him on the conning-tower.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, never mind about eating just now, this is altogether too wonderful\r\nto be missed for the sake of ordinary meat and drink. Let's go down and\r\nsee what there is on the other side.\"\r\n\r\nHe sent a message down the speaking tube to Murgatroyd, who was below\r\namong his beloved engines, and the next moment sun and clouds and\r\nice-peaks had disappeared and nothing was visible save the\r\nall-enveloping silver-grey mist.\r\n\r\nFor several minutes they remained silent, watching and wondering what\r\nthey would find beneath the veil which hid the surface of Venus from\r\ntheir view. Then the mist thinned out and broke up into patches which\r\ndrifted past them as they descended on their downward slanting course.\r\n\r\nBelow them they saw vast, ghostly shapes of mountains and valleys, lakes\r\nand rivers, continents, islands, and seas. Every moment these became\r\nmore and more distinct, and soon they were in full view of the most\r\nmarvellous landscape that human eyes had ever beheld. The distances were\r\ntremendous. Mountains, compared with which the Alps or even the Andes\r\nwould have seemed mere hillocks, towered up out of the vast depths\r\nbeneath them.\r\n\r\nUp to the lower edge of the all-covering cloud-sea they were clad with a\r\ngolden-yellow vegetation, fields and forests, open, smiling valleys, and\r\ndeep, dark ravines through which a thousand torrents thundered down from\r\nthe eternal snows beyond, to spread themselves out in rivers and lakes\r\nin the valleys and plains which lay many thousands of feet below.\r\n\r\n\"What a lovely world!\" said Zaidie, as she at last found her voice after\r\nwhat was almost a stupor of speechless wonder and admiration. \"And the\r\nlight! Did you ever see anything like it? It's neither moonlight nor\r\nsunlight. See, there are no shadows down there, it's just all lovely\r\nsilvery twilight. Lenox, if Venus is as nice as she looks from here I\r\ndon't think I shall want to go back. It reminds me of Tennyson's Lotus\r\nEaters, 'the Land where it is always afternoon.'\r\n\r\n\"I think you are right after all. We are thirty million miles nearer to\r\nthe Sun than we were on the Earth, and the light and heat have to filter\r\nthrough those clouds. They are not at all like Earth clouds from this\r\nside. It's the other way about. The silver lining is on this side. Look,\r\nthere isn't a black or a brown one, or even a grey one, within sight.\r\nThey are just like a thin mist, lighted by a million of electric lamps.\r\nIt's a delicious world, and if it isn't inhabited by angels it ought to\r\nbe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Zaidie was talking the _Astronef_ was sweeping swiftly down\r\ntowards the surface of Venus, through scenery of whose almost\r\ninconceivable magnificence no human words could convey any adequate\r\nidea. Underneath the cloud-veil the air was absolutely clear and\r\ntransparent, clearer, indeed, than terrestrial air at the highest\r\nelevations reached by mountain-climbers, and, moreover, it seemed to be\r\nendowed with a strange, luminous quality, which made objects, no matter\r\nhow distant, stand out with almost startling distinctness.\r\n\r\nThe rivers and lakes and seas which spread out beneath them, seemed\r\nnever to have been ruffled by blast of storm or breath of wind, and\r\ntheir surfaces shone with a soft, silvery light, which seemed to come\r\nfrom below rather than from above.\r\n\r\n\"If this isn't heaven it must be the half-way house,\" said Redgrave,\r\nwith what was, perhaps, under the circumstances, a pardonable\r\nirreverence. \"Still, after all, we don't know what the inhabitants may\r\nbe like, so I think we'd better close the doors, and drop on the top of\r\nthat mountain-spur running out between the two rivers into the bay. Do\r\nyou notice how curious the water looks after the Earth seas; bright\r\nsilver, instead of blue and green?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's just lovely,\" said Zaidie. \"Let's go down and have a walk.\r\nThere's nothing to be afraid of. You'll never make me believe that a\r\nworld like this can be inhabited by anything dangerous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps, but we mustn't forget what happened on Mars, _Madonna mia_.\r\nStill, there's one thing, we haven't been tackled by any aerial fleets\r\nyet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think the people here want air-ships. They can fly themselves.\r\nLook! there are a lot of them coming to meet us. That was a rather\r\nwicked remark of yours, Lenox, about the half-way house to heaven; but\r\nthose certainly do look something like angels.\"\r\n\r\nAs Zaidie said this, after a somewhat lengthy pause, during which the\r\n_Astronef_ had descended to within a few hundred feet of the\r\nmountain-spur, she handed her field-glasses to her husband, and pointed\r\ndownwards towards an island which lay a couple or miles or so off the\r\nend of the spur.\r\n\r\nHe put the glasses to his eyes, and took a long look through them.\r\nMoving them slowly up and down, and from side to side, he saw hundreds\r\nof winged figures rising from the island and floating towards them.\r\n\r\n\"You were right, dear,\" he said, without taking the glass from his eyes,\r\n\"and so was I. If those aren't angels, they're certainly something like\r\nmen, and, I suppose, women too who can fly. We may as well stop here and\r\nwait for them. I wonder what sort of an animal they take the _Astronef_\r\nfor.\"\r\n\r\nHe sent a message down the tube to Murgatroyd and gave a turn and a half\r\nto the steering-wheel. The propellers slowed down and the _Astronef_\r\ndropped with a hardly-perceptible shock in the midst of a little plateau\r\ncovered with a thick, soft moss of a pale yellowish green, and fringed\r\nby a belt of trees which seemed to be over three hundred feet high, and\r\nwhose foliage was a deep golden bronze.\r\n\r\nThey had scarcely landed before the flying figures reappeared over the\r\ntree tops and swept downwards in long spiral curves towards the\r\n_Astronef_.\r\n\r\n\"If they're not angels, they're very like them,\" said Zaidie, putting\r\ndown her glasses.\r\n\r\n\"There's one thing, they fly a lot better than the old masters' angels\r\nor Doré's could have done, because they have tails--or at least\r\nsomething that seems to serve the same purpose, and yet they haven't got\r\nfeathers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they have, at least round the edges of their wings or whatever\r\nthey are, and they've got clothes, too, silk tunics or something of that\r\nsort--and there are men and women.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're quite right, those fringes down their legs are feathers, and\r\nthat's how they can fly. They seem to have four arms.\"\r\n\r\nThe flying figures which came hovering near to the _Astronef_, without\r\nevincing any apparent sign of fear, were the strangest that human eyes\r\nhad looked upon. In some respects they had a sufficient resemblance for\r\nthem to be taken for winged men and women, while in another they bore a\r\ndecided resemblance to birds. Their bodies and limbs were human in\r\nshape, but of slenderer and lighter build; and from the shoulder-blades\r\nand muscles of the back there sprang a second pair of arms arching up\r\nabove their heads. Between these and the lower arms, and continued from\r\nthem down the side to the ankles, there appeared to be a flexible\r\nmembrane covered with a light feathery down, pure white on the inside,\r\nbut on the back a brilliant golden yellow, deepening to bronze towards\r\nthe edges, round which ran a deep feathery fringe.\r\n\r\nThe body was covered in front and down the back between the wings with a\r\nsort of divided tunic of a light, silken-looking material, which must\r\nhave been clothing, since there were many different colours all more or\r\nless of different hue among them. Below this and attached to the inner\r\nsides of the leg from the knee downward, was another membrane which\r\nreached down to the heels, and it was this which Redgrave somewhat\r\nflippantly alluded to as a tail. Its obvious purpose was to maintain the\r\nlongitudinal balance when flying.\r\n\r\nIn stature the inhabitants of the Love-Star varied from about five feet\r\nsix to five feet, but both the taller and the shorter of them were all\r\nof nearly the same size, from which it was easy to conclude that this\r\ndifference in stature was on Venus as well as on the Earth, one of the\r\nbroad distinctions between the sexes.\r\n\r\nThey flew round the _Astronef_ with an exquisite ease and grace which\r\nmade Zaidie exclaim:\r\n\r\n\"Now, why weren't we made like that on Earth?\"\r\n\r\nTo which Redgrave, after a look at the barometer, replied:\r\n\r\n\"Partly, I suppose, because we weren't built that way, and partly\r\nbecause we don't live in an atmosphere about two and a half times as\r\ndense as ours.\"\r\n\r\nThen several of the winged figures alighted on the mossy covering of the\r\nplain and walked towards the vessel.\r\n\r\n\"Why, they walk just like us, only much more prettily!\" said Zaidie.\r\n\"And look what funny little faces they've got! Half bird, half human,\r\nand soft, downy feathers instead of hair. I wonder whether they talk or\r\nsing. I wish you'd open the doors again, Lenox. I'm sure they can't\r\npossibly mean us any harm; they are far too pretty for that. What lovely\r\nsoft eyes they have, and what a thousand pities it is we shan't be able\r\nto understand them.\"\r\n\r\nThey had left the conning-tower, and both his lordship and Murgatroyd\r\nwere throwing open the sliding-doors and, to Zaidie's considerable\r\ndispleasure, getting the deck Maxims ready for action in case they\r\nshould be required. As soon as the doors were open Zaidie's judgment of\r\nthe inhabitants of Venus was entirely justified.\r\n\r\nWithout the slightest sign of fear, but with very evident astonishment\r\nin their round golden-yellow eyes, they came walking close up to the\r\nsides of the _Astronef_. Some of them stroked her smooth, shining sides\r\nwith their little hands, which Zaidie now found had only three fingers\r\nand a thumb. Many ages before they might have been birds' claws, but now\r\nthey were soft and pink and plump, utterly strange to manual work as it\r\nis understood upon Earth.\r\n\r\n\"Just fancy getting Maxim guns ready to shoot those delightful things,\"\r\nsaid Zaidie, almost indignantly, as she went towards the doorway from\r\nwhich the gangway ladder ran down to the soft, mossy turf. \"Why, not one\r\nof them has got a weapon of any sort; and just listen,\" she went on,\r\nstopping in the opening of the doorway, \"have you ever heard music like\r\nthat on Earth? I haven't. I suppose it's the way they talk. I'd give a\r\ngood deal to be able to understand them. But still, it's very lovely,\r\nisn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, like the voices of syrens,\" said Murgatroyd, speaking for the first\r\ntime since the _Astronef_ had landed; for this big, grizzled, taciturn\r\nYorkshireman, who looked upon the whole cruise through Space as a mad\r\nand almost impious adventure, which nothing but his hereditary loyalty\r\nto his master's name and family could have persuaded him to share in,\r\nhad grown more and more silent as the millions of miles between the\r\n_Astronef_ and his native Yorkshire village had multiplied day by day.\r\n\r\n\"Syrens--and why not, Andrew?\" laughed Redgrave. \"At any rate, I don't\r\nthink they look likely to lure us and the _Astronef_ to destruction.\"\r\nThen he went on: \"Yes, Zaidie, I never heard anything like that before.\r\nUnearthly, of course it is, but then we're not on Earth. Now, Zaidie,\r\nthey seem to talk in song-language. You did pretty well on Mars with\r\nyour American, suppose we go out and show them that you can speak the\r\nsong-language, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" she said; \"sing them something?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he replied; \"they'll try to talk to you in song, and you won't be\r\nable to understand them; at least, not as far as words and sentences go.\r\nBut music is the universal language on Earth, and there's no reason why\r\nit shouldn't be the same through the Solar System. Come along, tune up,\r\nlittle woman!\"\r\n\r\nThey went together down the gangway stairs, he dressed in an ordinary\r\nsuit of grey, English tweed, with a golf cap on the back of his head,\r\nand she in the last and daintiest of the costumes which the art of Paris\r\nand London and New York had produced before the _Astronef_ soared up\r\nfrom far-off Washington.\r\n\r\nThe moment that she set foot on the golden-yellow sward she was\r\nsurrounded by a swarm of the winged, and yet strangely human creatures.\r\nThose nearest to her came and touched her hands and face, and stroked\r\nthe folds of her dress. Others looked into her violet-blue eyes, and\r\nothers put out their queer little hands and stroked her hair.\r\n\r\nThis and her clothing seemed to be the most wonderful experience for\r\nthem, saving always the fact that she had only two arms and no wings.\r\nRedgrave kept close beside her until he was satisfied that these\r\nexquisite inhabitants of the new-found fairyland were innocent of any\r\nintention of harm, and when he saw two of the winged daughters of the\r\nLove-Star put up their hands and touch the thick coils of her hair, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Take those pins and things out and let it down. They seem to think that\r\nyour hair's part of your head. It's the first chance you've had to work\r\na miracle, so you may as well do it. Show them the most beautiful thing\r\nthey've ever seen.\"\r\n\r\n\"What babies you men can be when you get sentimental!\" laughed Zaidie,\r\nas she put her hands up to her head. \"How do you know that this may not\r\nbe ugly in their eyes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite impossible!\" he replied. \"They're a great deal too pretty\r\nthemselves to think _you_ ugly. Let it down!\"\r\n\r\nWhile he was speaking Zaidie had taken off a Spanish mantilla which she\r\nhad thrown over her head as she came out, and which the ladies of Venus\r\nseemed to think was part of her hair. Then she took out the comb and one\r\nor two hairpins which kept the coils in position, deftly caught the\r\nends, and then, after a few rapid movements of her fingers, she shook\r\nher head, and the wondering crowd about her saw, what seemed to them a\r\nshimmering veil, half gold, half silver, in the soft reflected light\r\nfrom the cloud-veil, fall down from her head over her shoulders.\r\n\r\nThey crowded still more closely round her, but so quietly and so gently\r\nthat she felt nothing more than the touch of wondering hands on her\r\narms, and dress, and hair. As Redgrave said afterwards, he was\r\n\"absolutely out of it.\" They seemed to imagine him to be a kind of\r\nuncouth monster, possibly the slave of this radiant being which had come\r\nso strangely from somewhere beyond the cloud-veil. They looked at him\r\nwith their golden-yellow eyes wide open, and some of them came up rather\r\ntimidly and touched his clothes, which they seemed to think were his\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nThen one or two, more daring, put their little hands up to his face and\r\ntouched his moustache, and all of them, while both examinations were\r\ngoing on, kept up a running conversation of cooing and singing which\r\nevidently conveyed their ideas from one to the other on the subject of\r\nthis most marvellous visit of these two strange beings with neither\r\nwings nor feathers, but who, most undoubtedly, had other means of\r\nflying, since it was quite certain that they had come from another\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nTheir ordinary speech was a low crooning note, like the language in\r\nwhich doves converse, mingled with a twittering current of undertone.\r\nBut every moment it rose into higher notes, evidently expressing wonder\r\nor admiration, or both.\r\n\r\n\"You were right about the universal language,\" said Redgrave, when he\r\nhad submitted to the stroking process for a few moments. \"These people\r\ntalk in music, and, as far as I can see or hear, their opinion of us,\r\nor, at least, of you, is distinctly flattering. I don't know what they\r\ntake _me_ for, and I don't care, but as we'd better make friends with\r\nthem suppose you sing them 'Home, Sweet Home,' or the 'Swanee River.' I\r\nshouldn't wonder if they consider our talking voices most horrible\r\ndiscords, so you might as well give them something different.\"\r\n\r\nWhile he was speaking the sounds about them suddenly hushed, and, as\r\nRedgrave said afterwards, it was something like the silence that follows\r\na cannon shot. Then, in the midst of the hush, Zaidie put her hands\r\nbehind her, looked up towards the luminous silver surface which formed\r\nthe only visible sky of Venus, and began to sing \"The Swanee River.\"\r\n\r\nThe clear, sweet notes rang up through the midst of a sudden silence.\r\nThe sons and daughters of the Love-Star instantly ceased their own soft\r\nmusical conversation, and Zaidie sang the old plantation song through\r\nfor the first time that a human voice had sung it to ears other than\r\nhuman.\r\n\r\nAs the last note thrilled sweetly from her lips she looked round at the\r\ncrowd of queer half-human shapes about her, and something in their\r\nunlikeness to her own kind brought back to her mind the familiar scenes\r\nwhich lay so far away, so many millions of miles across the dark and\r\nsilent Ocean of Space.\r\n\r\nOther winged figures, attracted by the sound of her singing, had crossed\r\nthe trees, and these, during the silence which came after the singing of\r\nthe song, were swiftly followed by others, until there were nearly a\r\nthousand of them gathered about the side of the _Astronef_.\r\n\r\nThere was no crowding or jostling among them. Each one treated every\r\nother with the most perfect gentleness and courtesy. No such thing as\r\nenmity or ill-feeling seemed to exist among them, and, in perfect\r\nsilence, they waited for Zaidie to continue what they thought was her\r\nlong speech of greeting. The temper of the throng somehow coincided\r\nexactly with the mood which her own memories had brought to her, and the\r\nnext moment she sent the first line of \"Home, Sweet Home\" soaring up to\r\nthe cloud-veiled sky.\r\n\r\nAs the notes rang up into the still, soft air a deeper hush fell on the\r\nlistening throng. Heads were bowed with a gesture almost of adoration,\r\nand many of those standing nearest to her bent their bodies forward, and\r\nexpanded their wings, bringing them together over their breasts with a\r\nmotion which, as they afterwards learnt, was intended to convey the idea\r\nof wonder and admiration, mingled with something like a sentiment of\r\nworship.\r\n\r\nZaidie sang the sweet old song through from end to end, forgetting for\r\nthe time being everything but the home she had left behind her on the\r\nbanks of the Hudson. As the last notes left her lips, she turned round\r\nto Redgrave and looked at him with eyes dim with the first tears that\r\nhad filled them since her father's death, and said, as he caught hold of\r\nher outstretched hand:\r\n\r\n\"I believe they've understood every word of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or, at any rate, every note. You may be quite certain of that,\" he\r\nreplied. \"If you had done that on Mars it might have been even more\r\neffective than the Maxims.\"\r\n\r\n\"For goodness sake don't talk about things like that in a heaven like\r\nthis! Oh, listen! They've got the tune already!\"\r\n\r\nIt was true! The dwellers of the Love-Star, whose speech was song, had\r\ninstantly recognised the sweetness of the sweetest of all earthly songs.\r\nThey had, of course, no idea of the meaning of the words; but the music\r\nspoke to them and told them that this fair visitant from another world\r\ncould speak the same speech as theirs. Every note and cadence was\r\nrepeated with absolute fidelity, and so the speech, common to the two\r\nfar-distant worlds, became a link connecting this wandering son and\r\ndaughter of the Earth with the sons and daughters of the Love-Star.\r\n\r\nThe throng fell back a little and two figures, apparently male and\r\nfemale, came to Zaidie and held out their right hands and began\r\naddressing her in perfectly harmonised song, which, though utterly\r\nunintelligible to her in the sense of speech, expressed sentiments which\r\ncould not possibly be mistaken, as there was a faint suggestion of the\r\nold English song running through the little song-speech that they made,\r\nand both Zaidie and her husband rightly concluded that it was intended\r\nto convey a welcome to the strangers from beyond the cloud-veil.\r\n\r\nAnd then the strangest of all possible conversations began. Redgrave,\r\nwho had no more notion of music than a walrus, perforce kept silence. In\r\nfact, he noticed with a certain displeasure which vanished speedily with\r\na musical, and half-malicious little laugh from Zaidie, that when he\r\nspoke the Bird-Folk drew back a little and looked in something like\r\nastonishment at him; but Zaidie was already in touch with them, and half\r\nby song and half by signs she very soon gave them an idea of what they\r\nwere and where they had come from. Her husband afterwards told her that\r\nit was the best piece of operatic acting he had ever seen, and,\r\nconsidering all the circumstances, this was very possibly true.\r\n\r\nIn the end the two who had come to give her what seemed to be the formal\r\ngreeting, were invited into the _Astronef_. They went on board without\r\nthe slightest sign of mistrust and with only an expression of mild\r\nwonder on their beautiful and strangely childlike faces.\r\n\r\nThen, while the other doors were being closed, Zaidie stood at the open\r\none above the gangway and made signs showing that they were going up\r\nbeyond the clouds and then down into the valley, and as she made the\r\nsigns she sang through the scale, her voice rising and falling in\r\nharmony with her gestures. The Bird-Folk understood her instantly, and\r\nas the door closed and the _Astronef_ rose from the ground, a thousand\r\nwings were outspread and presently hundreds of beautiful soaring forms\r\nwere circling about the Navigator of the Stars.\r\n\r\n\"Don't they look lovely!\" said Zaidie. \"I wonder what they would think\r\nif they could see us flying above New York or London or Paris with an\r\nescort like this. I suppose they're going to show us the way. Perhaps\r\nthey have a city down there. Suppose you were to go and get a bottle of\r\nchampagne and see if Master Cupid and Miss Venus would like a drink.\r\nWe'll see then if our nectar is anything like theirs.\"\r\n\r\nRedgrave went below. Meanwhile, for lack of other possible conversation,\r\nZaidie began to sing the last verse of \"Never Again.\" The melody almost\r\nexactly described the upward motion of the _Astronef_, and she could see\r\nthat it was instantly understood, for when she had finished their two\r\nvoices joined in an almost exact imitation of it.\r\n\r\nWhen Redgrave brought up the wine and the glasses they looked at them\r\nwithout any sign of surprise. The pop of the cork did not even make them\r\nlook round.\r\n\r\n\"Evidently a semi-angelic people, living on nectar and ambrosia, with\r\nnectar very like our own,\" he said, as he filled the glasses. \"Perhaps\r\nyou'd better give it to them. They seem to understand you better than\r\nthey do me--you being, of course, a good bit nearer to the angels than I\r\nam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks!\" she said, as she took a couple of glasses up, wondering a\r\nlittle what their visitors would do with them. Somewhat to her surprise,\r\nthey took them with a little bow and a smile and sipped at the wine,\r\nfirst with a swift glint of wonder in their eyes, and then with smiles\r\nwhich are unmistakable evidence of perfect appreciation.\r\n\r\n\"I thought so,\" said Redgrave, as he raised his own glass, and bowed\r\ngravely towards them. \"This is our nearest approach to nectar, and they\r\nseem to recognise it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And don't they just look like the sort of people who live on it, and,\r\nof course, other things?\" added Zaidie, as she too lifted her glass, and\r\nlooked with laughing eyes across the brim at her two guests.\r\n\r\nBut meanwhile Murgatroyd had been applying the repulsive force a little\r\ntoo strongly. The _Astronef_ shot up with a rapidity which soon left her\r\nwinged escort far below. She entered the cloud-veil and passed beyond\r\nit. The instant that the unclouded sun-rays struck the glass-roofing of\r\nthe deck-chamber their two guests, who had been moving about examining\r\neverything with a childlike curiosity, closed their eyes and clasped\r\ntheir hands over them, uttering little cries, tuneful and musical, but\r\nstill with a note of strange discord in them.\r\n\r\n\"Lenox, we must go down again,\" exclaimed Zaidie. \"Don't you see they\r\ncan't stand the light; it hurts them. Perhaps, poor dears, it's the\r\nfirst time they've ever been hurt in their lives. I don't believe they\r\nhave any of our ideas of pain or sorrow or anything of that sort. Take\r\nus back under the clouds--quick, or we may blind them.\"\r\n\r\nBefore she had ceased speaking, Redgrave had sent a signal down to\r\nMurgatroyd, and the _Astronef_ began to drop back again towards the\r\nsurface of the cloud-sea. Zaidie had, meanwhile, gone to her lady guest\r\nand dropped the black lace mantilla over her head, and, as she did so,\r\nshe caught herself saying:\r\n\r\n\"There, dear, we shall soon be back in your own light. I hope it hasn't\r\nhurt you. It was very stupid of us to do a thing like that.\"\r\n\r\nThe answer came in a little cooing murmur, which said, \"Thank you!\"\r\nquite as effectively as any earthly words could have done, and then the\r\n_Astronef_ passed through the cloud-sea. The soaring forms of her lost\r\nescort came into view again and clustered about her; and, surrounded by\r\nthem, she dropped, in obedience to their signs, down between the\r\ntremendous mountains and towards the island, thick with golden foliage,\r\nwhich lay two or three Earth-miles out in a bay, where four converging\r\nrivers spread out through a vast estuary into the sea.\r\n\r\nAs Lady Redgrave said afterwards to Mrs. Van Stuyler, she could have\r\nfilled a whole volume with a description of the exquisitely arcadian\r\ndelights with which the hours of the next ten days and nights were\r\nfilled. Possibly if she had been able to do justice to them, even her\r\naccount might have been received with qualified credence; but still some\r\nidea of them may be gathered from this extract of a conversation which\r\ntook place in the saloon of the _Astronef_ on the eleventh evening.\r\n\r\n\"But look here, Zaidie,\" said Redgrave, \"as we've found a world which is\r\ncertainly much more delightful than our own, why shouldn't we stop here\r\na bit? The air suits us and the people are simply enchanting. I think\r\nthey like us, and I'm sure you're in love with every one of them, male\r\nand female. Of course, it's rather a pity that we can't fly unless we do\r\nit in the _Astronef_. But that's only a detail. You're enjoying yourself\r\nthoroughly, and I never saw you looking better or, if possible, more\r\nbeautiful; and why on Earth--or Venus--do you want to go?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him steadily for a few moments, and with an expression\r\nwhich he had never seen on her face or in her eyes before, and then she\r\nsaid slowly and very sweetly, although there was something like a note\r\nof solemnity running through her tone:\r\n\r\n\"I altogether agree with you, dear; but there is something which you\r\ndon't seem to have noticed. As you say, we have had a perfectly\r\ndelightful time. It's a delicious world, and just everything that one\r\nwould think it to be; but if we were to stop here we should be\r\ncommitting one of the greatest of crimes, perhaps the greatest, that\r\never was committed within the limits of the Solar System.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Zaidie, what, in the name of what we used to call morals on the\r\nEarth, _do_ you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just this,\" she replied, leaning a little towards him in her\r\ndeck-chair. \"These people, half angels, and half men and women, welcomed\r\nus after we dropped through their cloud-veil, as friends; we were a\r\nlittle strange to them, certainly, but still they welcomed us as\r\nfriends. They had no suspicions of us; they didn't try to poison us or\r\nblow us up as those wretches on Mars did. They're just like a lot of\r\ngrown-up children with wings on. In fact they're about as nearly angels\r\nas anything we can think of. They've taken us into their palaces,\r\nthey've given us, as one might say, the whole planet. Everything was\r\nours that we liked to take. You know we have two or three hundredweight\r\nof precious stones on board now, which they would make me take just\r\nbecause they saw my rings.\r\n\r\n\"We've been living with them ten days now, and neither you nor I, nor\r\neven Murgatroyd, who, like the old Puritan that he is, seems to see sin\r\nor wrong in everything that looks nice, has seen a single sign among\r\nthem that they know anything about what we call sin or wrong on Earth.\r\nThere's no jealousy, no selfishness. In short, no envy, hatred, malice,\r\nand all uncharitableness; no vice, or meanness, or cheating, or any of\r\nthe abominations of the planet Terra, and _we come from that planet_. Do\r\nyou see what I mean now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I understand what you're driving at,\" said Redgrave; \"you mean,\r\nI suppose, that this world is something like Eden before the fall, and\r\nthat you and I--oh--but that's all rubbish you know. I've got my own\r\nshare of original sin, of course, but here it doesn't seem to come in;\r\nand as for you, the very idea of _you_ imagining yourself a feminine\r\nedition of the Serpent in Eden. Nonsense!\"\r\n\r\nShe got up out of her chair and, leaning over his, put her arm round his\r\nshoulder. Then she said very softly:\r\n\r\n\"I see you understand what I mean, Lenox. That's just it--original sin.\r\nIt doesn't matter how good you think me or I think you, but we have it.\r\nYou're an Earth-born man and I'm an Earth-born woman, and, as I'm your\r\nwife, I can say it plainly. We may think a good bit of each other, but\r\nthat's no reason why we might not be a couple of plague-spots in a\r\nsinless world like this. Surely you see what I mean, I needn't put it\r\nplainer, need I?\"\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met, and he read her meaning in hers. He put his arm up over\r\nher shoulder and drew her down towards him. Their lips met, and then he\r\ngot up and went down to the engine-room.\r\n\r\nA couple of minutes later the _Astronef_ sprang upwards from the midst\r\nof the delightful valley in which she was resting. No lights were shown.\r\nIn five minutes she had passed through the cloud-veil, and the next\r\nmorning when their new friends came to visit them and found that they\r\nhad vanished back into Space, there was sorrow for the first time among\r\nthe sons and daughters of the Love-Star.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Five hundred million miles from the Earth, and forty-seven million\r\nmiles from Jupiter,\" said Redgrave as he came into breakfast on the\r\nmorning of the twenty-eighth day after leaving Venus.\r\n\r\nDuring this brief period the _Astronef_ had recrossed the orbits of the\r\nEarth and Mars and had passed through that marvellous region of the\r\nSolar System, the Belt of the Asteroides. Nearly a hundred million miles\r\nof their journey had lain through this zone in which hundreds and\r\npossibly thousands of tiny planets revolve in vast orbits round the Sun.\r\n\r\nThen had come a world less void of over three hundred million miles,\r\nthrough which they voyaged alone, surrounded by the ever-constant\r\nsplendours of the heavens, and visited only now and then by one of those\r\nSpectres of Space, which we call comets.\r\n\r\nAstern the disc of the Sun steadily diminished and ahead the grey-blue\r\nshape of Jupiter, the Giant of the Solar System, had grown larger and\r\nlarger until now they could see it as it had never been seen before--a\r\ngigantic three-quarter moon filling up the whole heavens in front of\r\nthem almost from zenith to nadir. Three of its satellites, Europa,\r\nGanymede, and Calisto, were distinctly visible even to the naked eye,\r\nand Europa and Ganymede, happened to be in such a position in regard to\r\nthe _Astronef_ that her crew could see not only the bright sides turned\r\ntowards the Sun, but also the black shadow-spots which they cast on the\r\ncloud-veiled face of the huge planet. Calisto was above the horizon\r\nhanging like a tiny flicker of yellowish-red light above the rounded\r\nedge of Jupiter, and Io was invisible behind the planet.\r\n\r\n\"Five hundred million miles!\" said Zaidie, with a little shiver; \"that\r\nseems an awful long way from home--I mean America--doesn't it? I often\r\nwonder what they are thinking about us on the dear old Earth. I don't\r\nsuppose any one ever expects to see us again. However, it's no good\r\ngetting homesick in the middle of a journey when you're outward bound.\r\nAnd now what is the programme as regards His Majesty King Jove? We shall\r\nvisit the satellites of course?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied Redgrave; \"in fact, I shouldn't be surprised if our\r\nvisit was confined to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! do you mean to say we shan't land on Jupiter after coming nearly\r\nsix hundred million miles to see him? That would be disappointing. But\r\nwhy not? don't you think he's ready to be visited yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't say that, but you must remember that no one has the remotest\r\nnotion of what there is behind the clouds or whatever they are which\r\nform those bands. All we really know about Jupiter is that he is of\r\nenormous size, for instance, he's over twelve hundred times bigger than\r\nthe Earth and that his density isn't much greater than that of\r\nwater--and my humble opinion is that if we're able to go through the\r\nclouds without getting the _Astronef_ red-hot we shall find that Jupiter\r\nis in the same state as the Earth was a good many million years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said Zaidie, \"you mean just a mass of blazing, boiling rock and\r\nmetal which will make islands and continents some day; and that what we\r\ncall the cloud-bands are the vapours which will one day make its seas.\r\nWell, if we can get through these clouds we ought to see something worth\r\nseeing. Just fancy a whole world as big as that all ablaze like molten\r\niron! Do you think we shall be able to see it, Lenox?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not so sure about that, little woman. We shall have to go to work\r\nrather cautiously. You see Jupiter is far bigger than any world we've\r\nvisited yet, and if we got too close to him the _Astronef's_ engines\r\nmight not be powerful enough to drive us away again. Then we should\r\neither stop there till the R. Force was exhausted or be drawn towards\r\nhim and perhaps drop into an ocean of molten rock and metal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks!\" said Zaidie, with a shrug of her shapely shoulders. \"That\r\n_would_ be an ignominious end to a journey like this, to say nothing of\r\nthe boiling oil part of it; so I suppose you'll make stopping-places of\r\nthe satellites and use their attraction to help you to resist His\r\nMajesty's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your Ladyship's reasoning is perfect. I propose to visit them in turn,\r\nbeginning with Calisto. I shouldn't be at all surprised if we found\r\nsomething interesting on them. You know they're quite little worlds of\r\nthemselves. They're all bigger than our moon, except Europa. Ganymede,\r\nin fact, is two-thirds bigger than Mercury, and if old Jupiter is still\r\nin a state of fiery incandescence there's no reason why we shouldn't\r\nfind on Ganymede or one of the others the same state of things that\r\nexisted on our moon when the Earth was blazing hot.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't wonder,\" said Zaidie; \"I've often heard my father say that\r\nthat was probably what happened. It's all very marvellous, isn't it?\r\ndeath in one place, life in another, all beginnings and endings, and yet\r\nno actual beginning or end of anything anywhere. That's eternity, I\r\nsuppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's just about as near as the finite intellect can get to it, I should\r\nsay,\" replied Redgrave. \"But I don't think metaphysics are much in our\r\nline. If you've finished we may as well go and have a look at the\r\nrealities.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which the metaphysicians,\" laughed Zaidie as she rose, \"would tell you\r\nare not realities at all, or only realities so far as you can think\r\nabout them. 'Thinks,' in short, instead of real things. But meanwhile\r\nI've got the breakfast _things_ to put away, so you can go up on deck\r\nand put the telescopes in order.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she joined him a few minutes later in the deck-chamber the\r\nthree-quarter disc of Jupiter was rapidly approaching the full.\r\n\r\nIts phases are invisible from the Earth owing to the enormous distance;\r\nbut from the deck of the _Astronef_ they had been plainly visible for\r\nsome days, and, since the huge planet turns on its axis in less than ten\r\nhours, or with more than twice the speed of the Earth's rotation, the\r\nphases followed each other very rapidly.\r\n\r\nThus at twelve o'clock noon by _Astronef_ time they might have seen a\r\ngigantic rim of silver-blue overarching the whole vault of heaven in\r\nfront of them. By five o'clock it would be a hemisphere, and by five\r\nminutes to ten the vast sphere would be once more shining full-orbed\r\nupon them. By eight o'clock next morning they would find Jupiter \"new\"\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThey were now falling very rapidly towards the huge planet, and, since\r\nthere is no up or down in Space, the nearer they got to it the more it\r\nappeared to sink below them and become, as it were, the floor of the\r\nCelestial Sphere. As the crescent approached the full they were able to\r\nexamine the mysterious bands as human observers had never examined them\r\nbefore. For hours they sat almost silent at their telescopes, trying to\r\nprobe the mystery which has baffled human science since the days of\r\nGalileo, and gradually it became plain that Redgrave was correct in the\r\nhypothesis which he had derived from Flammarion and one or two others of\r\nthe more advanced astronomers.\r\n\r\n\"I believe I was right, or, in other words, those that I got the idea\r\nfrom are,\" he said, as they approached the orbit of Calisto, which\r\nrevolves at a distance of about eleven hundred thousand miles from the\r\nsurface of Jupiter.\r\n\r\n\"Those belts are made of clouds or vapour in some stage or other. The\r\nhighest--the ones along the Equator and what we should call the\r\nTemperate Zones--are the highest, and therefore coolest and whitest. The\r\ndark ones are the lowest and hottest. I daresay they are more like what\r\nwe should call volcanic clouds. Do you see how they keep changing?\r\nThat's what's bothered our astronomers. Look at that big one yonder a\r\nbit to the north, going from brown to red. I suppose that's something\r\nlike the famous red spot which they have been puzzling about. What do\r\nyou make of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Zaidie, looking up from her telescope, \"it's quite certain\r\nthat the glare must come from underneath. It can't be sunlight, because\r\nthe poor old Sun doesn't seem to have strength enough to make a decent\r\nsunset or sunrise here, and look how it's running along to the westward!\r\nWhat does that mean, do you think?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say it means that some half-formed Jovian Continent has been\r\nflung sky high by a big burst-up underneath, and that's the blaze of the\r\nincandescent stuff running along. Just fancy a continent, say ten times\r\nthe size of Asia, being split up and sent flying in a few moments like\r\nthat. Look! there's another one to the north! On the whole, dear, I\r\ndon't think we should find the climate on the other side of those clouds\r\nvery salubrious. Still, as they say the atmosphere of Jupiter is about\r\nten thousand miles thick, we may be able to get near enough to see\r\nsomething of what's going on.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile, here comes Calisto. Look at his shadow flying across the\r\nclouds. And there's Ganymede coming up after him, and Europa behind him.\r\nTalk about eclipses! they must be about as common here as thunderstorms\r\nare with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't have a thunderstorm every day--at least not at home,\"\r\ncorrected Zaidie, \"but on Jupiter they must have two or three eclipses\r\nevery day. Meanwhile, there goes Jupiter himself. What a difference\r\ndistance makes! This little thing is only a trifle larger than our Moon,\r\nand it's hiding everything else.\"\r\n\r\nAs she was speaking the full-orbed disc of Calisto, measuring nearly\r\nthree thousand miles across, swept between them and the planet. It shone\r\nwith a clear, somewhat reddish light like that of Mars. The _Astronef_\r\nwas feeling his attraction strongly, and Redgrave went to the levers and\r\nturned on about a fifth of the R. Force to avoid too sudden contact with\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"Another dead world!\" said Redgrave, as the surface of Calisto revolved\r\nswiftly beneath them, \"or at any rate a dying one. There must be an\r\natmosphere of some sort, or else that snow and ice wouldn't be there,\r\nand everything would be either black or white as it was on the Moon. We\r\nmay as well land, however, and get a specimen of the rocks and soil to\r\nadd to the museum, though I don't expect there will be very much to see\r\nin the way of life.\"\r\n\r\nIn another hour or so the _Astronef_ had dropped gently on to the\r\nsurface of Calisto at the foot of a range of mountains crowded with\r\njagged and splintery peaks, and a mile or two from the edge of a sea of\r\nsnow and ice which stretched away in a vast expanse of rugged frozen\r\nbillows beyond the horizon. Redgrave, as usual, went into the\r\nair-chamber and tried the atmosphere. A second's experience of it was\r\nenough for him. It was unbreathably thin and unbearably cold, although,\r\nwhen mixed with the air of the _Astronef_, it distinctly freshened it\r\nup. This proved that its composition was, or had been, fit for human\r\nrespiration.\r\n\r\n\"There's only one fault about it,\" he said, when he rejoined Zaidie in\r\nthe sitting-room. \"You know what the schoolboy said when he started\r\nkissing his first sweetheart, 'It takes too long to get enough of it.'\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem to be very fond of referring to that particular subject,\r\nLenox.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes; to tell you the truth I am,\" and then he referred to it\r\nagain in another form.\r\n\r\nAfter this they went and put on their breathing-dresses and went for a\r\nwelcome stroll along the arid shores of the frozen sea after their\r\nlengthy confinement to the decks of the _Astronef_. The Sun was still\r\npowerful enough to keep them comfortably warm in their dresses, and\r\nthere was enough atmosphere to make this warmth diffused instead of\r\ndirect. So they were able to step out briskly, and every now and then\r\nopen their visors a little and take in a breath or two of the thin,\r\nsharp air, which they found quite exhilarating when mixed with the air\r\nsupplied by their own oxygen apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe attraction of the satellite being only a little more than that of\r\nthe Moon--or, say, about a fifth of that of the Earth--they were able to\r\nget along with a series of hops, skips, and jumps which might have\r\nlooked rather ridiculous to terrestrial eyes, but which they found a\r\nvery pleasant mode of locomotion. They were also able to climb the\r\nsteepest mountainsides with no more trouble than they would have had in\r\nwalking along a terrestrial plain.\r\n\r\nOn the heights they found no sign either of animal or vegetable\r\nlife--only rocks and gravel and sand of a brownish red, apparently\r\nuniform in composition. They took a few lumps of rock and a canvas bag\r\nfull of sand back with them from the mountain-side. In the valley\r\nsloping towards the ice-sea they found what had once been watercourses\r\nopening out into rivers towards the sea; and in the lowest parts there\r\nwas a kind of lichen-growth clinging to the rocks under the snow. On the\r\nsurface of the snow they saw traces of what might have been the tracks\r\nof animals, but, as there was no breath of wind in the attenuated\r\natmosphere, it was quite possible that these might have been frozen into\r\npermanent shape hundreds or thousands of years before. It was also\r\npossible that if they had explored long enough they might have found\r\nsome low forms of animal life, but as they had landed almost on the\r\nequator of the satellite, under the full rays of the Sun, and seen\r\nnothing, this was hardly likely.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think it is worth while stopping here any longer,\" said Zaidie,\r\nwho was getting a little bit _blasé_ with her interplanetary\r\nexperiences. \"We've got lots to see further on, so if you don't mind I\r\nthink I'll just take two or three photographs, then we can get back to\r\nthe ship and have dinner and go on and see what Ganymede is like. He's\r\nbigger than Mercury, and nearly as big as Mars, so we ought to find\r\nsomething interesting there. This is only a sort of combination of the\r\nMoon and the polar regions and I don't think very much of it. Suppose we\r\ngo back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as your Ladyship pleases,\" laughed Redgrave over the wire which\r\nconnected their helmets, as, with joined hands, they turned back and\r\ndanced along the snow-covered ocean shore towards the _Astronef_.\r\n\r\nZaidie took a couple of photographs of the mountain range and the\r\nice-sea and another one of the general landscape of Calisto as they rose\r\nfrom the surface. Then, while she went to get lunch ready, Redgrave took\r\nthe pieces of rock and the bag of dust into the laboratory which opened\r\nout of the main engine-room and analysed them. When he came out about an\r\nhour later he saw Murgatroyd going through his beloved engines with an\r\noil-can and a piece of common cotton-waste which had come from a faraway\r\nYorkshire mill.\r\n\r\n\"Andrew,\" he said, \"should you be surprised if I told you that that moon\r\nwe've just left seems to be mostly made of a spongy sort of alloy of\r\ngold and silver?\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" said the old engineer, straightening himself up and looking\r\nat him with eyes in which this announcement had not seemed to kindle a\r\nspark of interest, \"after what I have seen so far there's nothing\r\nthat'll surprise me unless it be that the grace of God allows us to get\r\nback safely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen, Andrew, that's well said,\" replied Redgrave, and then he went\r\nback to the saloon and Murgatroyd went on with his oiling.\r\n\r\nWhen he told her ladyship of his discovery she just looked up from the\r\ntable she was laying and said:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, indeed! Well, I'm very glad that it's five or six hundred million\r\nmiles from the Earth. A dead world bigger than the Moon, and made of\r\ngold and silver sponge, wouldn't be a nice thing to have too near the\r\nEarth. There's trouble enough about that sort of thing at home as it is.\r\nStill, it'll be a nice addition to the museum, and if you'll put it away\r\nand go and wash your hands lunch will be ready.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they got back to the deck-chamber Calisto was already a half moon\r\nin the upper sky nearly five hundred thousand miles away, and the full\r\norb of Ganymede, shining with a pale golden light, lay outspread beneath\r\nthem. A thin, bluish-grey arc of the giant planet overarched its western\r\nedge.\r\n\r\n\"I think we shall find something like a world here,\" said her ladyship,\r\nwhen she had taken her first look through her telescope; \"there's an\r\natmosphere and what look like thin clouds. Continents and oceans too, or\r\nsomething like them, and what is that light shining up between the\r\nbreaks? Isn't it something like our Aurora?\"\r\n\r\n\"It might be,\" replied Redgrave, turning his own telescope towards the\r\nnorthern pole of Ganymede, \"though I never heard of a satellite having\r\nan aurora. Perhaps it's the Sun shining on the ice.\"\r\n\r\nAs the _Astronef_ fell towards the surface of Ganymede she crossed his\r\nnorthern pole, and the nearer they got the plainer it became that a\r\nlight very like the terrestrial Aurora was playing about it,\r\nilluminating the thin, yellow clouds with a bluish-violet light, which\r\nmade magnificent contrasts of colouring amongst them.\r\n\r\n\"Let us go down there and see what it's like,\" said Zaidie. \"There must\r\nbe something nice under all those lovely colours.\"\r\n\r\nRedgrave checked the R. Force and the _Astronef_ fell obliquely across\r\nthe pole towards the equator. As they approached the luminous clouds\r\nRedgrave turned it on again, and they sank slowly through a glowing mist\r\nof innumerable colours, until the surface of Ganymede came into plain\r\nview about ten miles below them.\r\n\r\nWhat they saw then was the strangest sight they had beheld since they\r\nhad left the Earth. As far as their eyes could reach the surface of the\r\nGanymede was covered with vast orderly patches, mostly rectangular, of\r\nwhat they at first took for ice, but which they soon found to be a\r\nsomething that was self-illuminating.\r\n\r\n\"Glorified hot-houses, as I'm alive,\" exclaimed Redgrave. \"Whole cities\r\nunder glass, fields, too, and lit by electricity or something very like\r\nit. Zaidie, we shall find human beings down there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if we do I hope they won't be like the half-human things we found\r\non Mars! But isn't it all just lovely! Only there doesn't seem to be\r\nanything outside the cities, at least nothing but bare, flat ground with\r\na few rugged mountains here and there. See, there's a nice level plain\r\nthere near the big glass city, or whatever it is. Suppose we go down\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\nRedgrave checked the after engine which was driving them obliquely over\r\nthe surface of the satellite, and the _Astronef_ fell vertically towards\r\na bare, flat plain of what looked like deep yellow sand, which spread\r\nfor miles alongside one of the glittering cities of glass.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, look, they've seen us!\" exclaimed Zaidie. \"I do hope they're going\r\nto be as friendly as those dear people on Venus were.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so,\" replied Redgrave, \"but if they're not we've got the guns\r\nready.\"\r\n\r\nAs he said this about twenty streams of an intense bluish light suddenly\r\nshot up all round them, concentrating themselves upon the hull of the\r\n_Astronef_, which was now about a mile and a half from the surface. The\r\nlight was so intense that the rays of the Sun were lost in it. They\r\nlooked at each other, and found that their faces looked almost perfectly\r\nwhite in it. The plain and the city below had vanished.\r\n\r\nTo look downwards was like staring straight into the focus of a ten\r\nthousand candle-power electric arc lamp. It was so intolerable that\r\nRedgrave closed the lower shutters, and meanwhile he found that the\r\n_Astronef_ had ceased to descend. He shut off more of the R. Force, but\r\nit produced no effect. The _Astronef_ remained stationary. Then he\r\nordered Murgatroyd to set the propellers in motion. The engineer pulled\r\nthe starting-levers, and then came up out of the engine-room and said to\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n\"It's no good, my Lord; I don't know what devil's world we've got into\r\nnow, but they won't work. If I thought that engines could be\r\nbewitched----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nonsense, Andrew!\" said his lordship rather testily. \"It's\r\nperfectly simple: those people down there, whoever they are, have got\r\nsome way of demagnetising us, or else they've got the R. Force too, and\r\nthey're applying it against us to stop us going down. Apparently they\r\ndon't want us. No, that's just to show us that they can stop us if they\r\nwant to. The light's going down. Begin dropping a bit. Don't start the\r\npropellers, but just go and see that the guns are all right in case of\r\naccidents.\"\r\n\r\nThe old engineer nodded and went back to his engines, looking\r\nconsiderably scared. As he spoke the brilliancy of the light faded\r\nrapidly, and the _Astronef_ began to sink slowly towards the surface.\r\n\r\nAs a precaution against their being allowed to drop with force enough to\r\ncause a disaster, Redgrave turned the R. Force on again and they fell\r\nslowly towards the plain, through what seemed like a halo of perfectly\r\nwhite light. When she was within a couple of hundred yards of the ground\r\na winged car of exquisitely graceful shape rose from the roof of one of\r\nthe huge glass buildings nearest to them, flew swiftly towards them, and\r\nafter circling once round the dome of the upper deck, ran close\r\nalongside.\r\n\r\nThe car was occupied by two figures of distinctly human form but rather\r\nmore than human stature. Both were dressed in long, close-fitting\r\ngarments of what seemed like a golden brown fleece. Their heads were\r\ncovered with a close hood and their hands with gloves.\r\n\r\n\"What an exceedingly handsome man!\" said Zaidie, as one of them stood\r\nup. \"I never saw such a noble-looking face in my life; it's half\r\nphilosopher, half saint. Of course, you won't be jealous?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nonsense!\" he laughed. \"It would be quite impossible to imagine\r\n_you_ in love with either. But he is handsome, and evidently\r\nfriendly--there's no mistaking that. Answer him, Zaidie; you can do it\r\nbetter than I can.\"\r\n\r\nThe car had now come close alongside. The standing figure stretched its\r\nhands out, palms upward, smiled a smile which Zaidie thought was very\r\nsweetly solemn, next the head was bowed, and the gloved hands brought\r\nback and crossed over his breast. Zaidie imitated the movements exactly.\r\nThen, as the figure raised its head she raised hers, and she found\r\nherself looking into a pair of large, luminous eyes such as she could\r\nhave imagined under the brows of an angel. As they met hers a look of\r\nunmistakable wonder and admiration came into them. Redgrave was standing\r\njust behind her; she took him by the hand and drew him beside her,\r\nsaying, with a little laugh:\r\n\r\n\"Now, please look as pleasant as you can; I am sure they are very\r\nfriendly. A man with a face like that couldn't mean any harm.\"\r\n\r\nThe figure repeated the motions to Redgrave, who returned them, perhaps\r\na trifle awkwardly.\r\n\r\nThen the car began to descend, and the figure beckoned to them to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\n\"You'd better go and wrap up, dear. From the gentleman's dress it seems\r\npretty cold outside; though the air is evidently quite breathable,\" said\r\nRedgrave, as the _Astronef_ began to drop in company with the car. \"At\r\nany rate, I'll try it first, and if it isn't we can put on our\r\nbreathing-dresses.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Zaidie had made her winter toilet, and Redgrave had found the air\r\nto be quite respirable, but of Arctic cold, they went down the gangway\r\nladder about twenty minutes later. The figure had got out of the car,\r\nwhich was laying a few yards from them on the sandy plain, and came\r\nforward to meet them with both hands outstretched.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Came forward to meet them with both hands outstretched._]\r\n\r\nZaidie unhesitatingly held out hers, and a strange thrill ran through\r\nher as she felt them for the first time clasped gently by other than\r\nearthly hands, for the Venus folk had only been able to pat and stroke\r\nwith their gentle little paws, somewhat as a kitten might do. The figure\r\nbowed its head again and said something in a low, melodious voice, which\r\nwas, of course, quite unintelligible save for the evident friendliness\r\nof its tone. Then, releasing her hands, he took Redgrave's in the same\r\nfashion, and then led the way towards a vast, domed building of\r\nsemi-opaque glass, or rather a substance that seemed to be something\r\nlike a mixture of glass and mica, which appeared to be one of the\r\nentrance gates of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wondering visitors from far-off Terra had hardly halted before the\r\nmagnificent portal when a huge sheet of frosted glass rose silently from\r\nthe ground. They passed through and it fell behind them. They found\r\nthemselves in a great oval ante-chamber along each side of which stood\r\ntriple rows of strangely shaped trees whose leaves gave off a subtle and\r\nmost agreeable scent. The temperature here was several degrees higher,\r\nin fact about that of an English spring day, and Zaidie immediately\r\nthrew open her big fur cloak, saying:\r\n\r\n\"These good people seem to live in Winter Gardens, don't they? I don't\r\nthink I shall want these things much while we're inside. I wonder what\r\ndear old Andrew would have thought of this if we could have persuaded\r\nhim to leave the ship.\"\r\n\r\nThey followed their host through the ante-chamber towards a magnificent\r\npointed arch raised on clusters of small pillars each of a differently\r\ncoloured, highly polished stone, which shone brilliantly in a light\r\nwhich seemed to come from nowhere. Another door, this time of pale\r\ntransparent blue glass, rose as they approached; they passed under it,\r\nand as it fell behind them half a dozen figures, considerably shorter\r\nand slighter than their host, came forward to meet them. He took off his\r\ngloves and cape and thick outer covering, and they were glad to follow\r\nhis example for the atmosphere was now that of a warm June day.\r\n\r\nThe attendants, as they evidently were, took their wraps from them,\r\nlooking at the furs and stroking them with evident wonder; but with\r\nnothing like the wonder which came into their big soft grey eyes when\r\nthey looked at Zaidie, who, as usual when she arrived on a new world,\r\nwas arrayed in one of her daintiest costumes.\r\n\r\nTheir host was now dressed in a tunic of a light blue material, which\r\nglistened with a lustre greater than that of the finest silk. It reached\r\na little below his knees, and was confined at the waist by a sash of the\r\nsame colour but of somewhat deeper hue. His feet and legs were covered\r\nwith stockings of the same material and colour, and his feet, which were\r\nsmall for his stature and exquisitely shaped, were shod with thin\r\nsandals of a material which looked like soft felt, and which made no\r\nnoise as he walked over the delicately coloured mosaic pavement of the\r\nstreet--for such it actually was--which ran past the gate.\r\n\r\nWhen he removed his cape they expected to find that he was bald like the\r\nMartians, but they were mistaken. His well-shaped head was covered with\r\nlong, thick hair of a colour something between bronze and grey. A broad\r\nband of metal looking like light gold passed round the upper part of his\r\nforehead, and from under this the hair fell in gentle waves to below his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments Zaidie and Redgrave stared about them in frank and\r\nsilent wonder. They were standing in a broad street running in a\r\nstraight line to what seemed to be several miles along the edge of a\r\ncity of crystal. It was lined with double rows of trees with beds of\r\nbrilliantly coloured flowers between them. From this street others went\r\noff at right angles and at regular intervals. The roof of the city\r\nappeared to be composed of an infinity of domes of enormous extent,\r\nsupported by tall clusters of slender pillars standing at the street\r\ncorners. The general level of the roof seemed about three hundred feet\r\nabove the ground, and the summits of the domes some fifty feet higher.\r\n\r\nThe houses, which were all square, were, as a rule, about forty feet\r\nhigh. The roofs were covered with gardens and shrubberies, from which\r\ncreepers, bearing brillantly coloured leaves and flowers, hung down\r\nabout the windows in carefully arranged festoons. The walls were\r\ncomposed of the opaque mica-like glass, relieved by pillars and arched\r\ndoorways and windows. The windows, of French form, were of clear glass,\r\nand mostly stood open. A sweet, cool zephyr of hardly perceptible\r\nstrength appeared to be blowing along the street and over the house-tops\r\nand in the vast airy space above the roofs.\r\n\r\nBrightly plumaged birds were flitting about among the branches of giant\r\ntrees, and keeping up a perpetual chorus of song.\r\n\r\nPresently their host touched Redgrave on the shoulder and pointed to a\r\nfour-wheeled car of light framework and exquisite design, containing\r\nseats for four besides the driver, or guide, who sat behind. He held out\r\nhis hand to Zaidie, and handed her to one of the front seats just as an\r\nEarth-born gentleman might have done. Then he motioned to Redgrave to\r\nsit beside her, and mounted behind them.\r\n\r\nThe car immediately began to move silently, but with considerable speed,\r\nalong the left-hand side of the outer street, which, like all the\r\nothers, was divided by narrow strips of russet-coloured grass and\r\nflowering shrubs.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes it swung round to the right, crossed the road, and\r\nentered a magnificent avenue, which, after a run of some four miles,\r\nended in a vast, park-like square, measuring at least a mile each way.\r\n\r\nThe two sides of the avenue were busy with cars like their own, some\r\ncarrying six people, and others only the driver. Those on each side of\r\nthe road all went in the same direction. Those nearest to the broad\r\nside-walks between the houses and the first row of trees went at a\r\nmoderate speed of five or six miles an hour, but along the inner sides,\r\nnear the central line of trees, they seemed to be running as high as\r\nthirty miles an hour. Their occupants were nearly all dressed in clothes\r\nmade of the same glistening, silky fabric as their host wore, but the\r\ncolourings were of infinite variety.\r\n\r\nIt was quite easy to distinguish between the sexes, although in stature\r\nthey were almost equal. The men were nearly all clothed as their host\r\nwas. The colours of their garments were quieter, and there was little\r\nattempt at personal adornment, though many wore bands of an intensely\r\nbright, sky-blue metal round their arms above the elbow, and others wore\r\nbelts and necklaces of links composed of this and two other metals\r\nresembling gold and aluminum, but of an exceedingly high lustre.\r\n\r\nThe women were dressed in flowing garments something after the Greek\r\nstyle, but they were of brighter hues and much more lavishly embroidered\r\nthan the men's tunics were. They also wore much more jewellery. Indeed,\r\nsome of the younger ones glittered from head to foot with polished metal\r\nand gleaming stones. There was one more difference which they quickly\r\nnoticed. The men's hair, like their host's, was nearly always wavy, but\r\nthat of the women, especially the younger, was a mass of either natural\r\nor artificial curls, short and crisp about the head, and flowing down in\r\nglistening ringlets to their waists.\r\n\r\n\"Could any one ever have dreamt of such a lovely place?\" said Zaidie,\r\nafter their wondering eyes had become accustomed to the marvels about\r\nthem, \"and yet--oh dear, now I know what it reminds me of! Flammarion's\r\nbook, 'The End of the World,' where he describes the remnants of the\r\nhuman race dying of cold and hunger on the Equator in places something\r\nlike this. I suppose the life of poor Ganymede is giving out, and that's\r\nwhy they've got to live in magnified exposition buildings, poor things!\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor things!\" laughed Redgrave. \"I'm afraid I can't agree with you\r\nthere, dear. I never saw a jollier-looking lot of people in my life. I\r\ndaresay you're quite right, but they certainly seem to view their\r\napproaching end with considerable equanimity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be horrid, Lenox! Fancy talking in that cold-blooded way about\r\nsuch delightful-looking people as these, why, they are even nicer than\r\nour dear bird-folk on Venus, and of course they are a great deal more\r\nlike ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wherefore it stands to reason that they must be a great deal nicer!\" he\r\nreplied, with a glance which brought a brighter flush to her cheeks.\r\nThen he went on, \"Ah, now I see the difference.\"\r\n\r\n\"What difference? Between what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Between the daughter of Earth and the daughters of Ganymede,\" he\r\nreplied. \"You can blush, and I don't think they can. Haven't you noticed\r\nthat, although they have the most exquisite skins and beautiful eyes and\r\nhair and all that sort of thing, not a man or woman of them has any\r\ncolouring? I suppose that's the result of living for generations in a\r\nhothouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely,\" she said; \"but has it struck you also that all the girls\r\nand women are either beautiful or handsome, and all the men, except the\r\nones that seem to be servants or slaves, are something like Greek gods,\r\nor, at least, the sort of men you see on the Greek sculptures?\"\r\n\r\n\"Survival of the fittest, I presume. These are probably the descendants\r\nof the highest races of Ganymede; the people who conceived the idea of\r\nprolonging the life of their race and were able to carry it out. The\r\ninferior races would either perish of starvation or become their\r\nservants. That's what will happen on Earth, and there is no reason why\r\nit shouldn't have happened here.\"\r\n\r\nAs he said this the car swung out round a broad curve into the centre of\r\nthe great square, and a little cry of amazement broke from Zaidie's lips\r\nas her glance roamed over the multiplying splendours about her.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the square, in the midst of smooth lawns and\r\nflower-beds of every conceivable shape and colour, and groves of\r\nflowering trees, stood a great domed building, which they approached\r\nthrough an avenue of overarching trees interlaced with flowering\r\ncreepers.\r\n\r\nThe car stopped at the foot of a triple flight of stairs of dazzling\r\nwhiteness which led up to a broad arched doorway. Several groups of\r\npeople were sprinkled about the avenue and steps and the wide terrace\r\nwhich ran along the front of the building. They looked with keen, but\r\nperfectly well-mannered surprise at their strange visitors, and seemed\r\nto be discussing their appearance; but not a step was taken towards\r\nthem, nor was there the slightest sign of anything like vulgar\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\n\"What perfect manners these dear people have!\" said Zaidie, as they\r\ndismounted at the foot of the staircase. \"I wonder what would happen if\r\na couple of them were to be landed from a motor-car in front of the\r\nCapitol at Washington. I suppose this is their Capitol, and we've been\r\nbrought here to be put through our facings. What a pity we can't talk to\r\nthem! I wonder if they'd believe our story if we could tell it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've no doubt they know something of it already,\" replied Redgrave;\r\n\"they're evidently people of immense intelligence. Intellectually, I\r\ndaresay, we're mere children compared with them, and it's quite possible\r\nthat they have developed senses which we have no idea of.\"\r\n\r\n\"And perhaps,\" added Zaidie, \"all the time that we are talking to each\r\nother our friend here is quietly reading everything that is going on in\r\nour minds.\"\r\n\r\nWhether this was so or not their host gave no sign of comprehension. He\r\nled them up the steps and through the great doorway, where he was met by\r\nthree splendidly dressed men even taller than himself.\r\n\r\n\"I feel beastly shabby among all these gorgeously attired personages,\"\r\nsaid Redgrave, looking down at his plain tweed suit, as they were\r\nconducted with every manifestation of politeness along the magnificent\r\nvestibule into which the door opened.\r\n\r\n\"And I'm sure I am quite a dowdy in comparison with these lovely\r\ncreatures,\" added Zaidie, \"although this dress was made in Paris. Lenox,\r\nif things are for sale here you'll have to buy me one of those costumes,\r\nand we'll take it back and get one made like it. I wonder what they'd\r\nthink of me dressed in one of those costumes at a ball at the\r\nWaldorf-Astoria.\"\r\n\r\nBefore he could make a suitable reply, a door at the end of the\r\nvestibule opened and they were ushered into a large hall which was\r\nevidently a council-chamber. At the further end of it were three\r\nsemi-circular rows of seats made of a polished silvery metal, and in the\r\ncentre and raised slightly above them another under a canopy of sky-blue\r\nsilk. This seat and six others were occupied by men of most venerable\r\naspect, in spite of the fact their hair was just as long and thick and\r\nglossy as their host's or even as Zaidie's own.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of introduction was exceedingly simple. Though they could\r\nnot, of course, understand a word he said, it was evident from his\r\neloquent gestures that their host described the way in which they had\r\ncome from Space and landed on the surface of the World of the Crystal\r\nCities, as Zaidie subsequently re-christened Ganymede.\r\n\r\nThe President of the Senate or Council spoke a few sentences in a deep\r\nmusical tone. Then their host, taking their hands, led them up to his\r\nseat, and the President rose and took them by both hands in turn. Then,\r\nwith a grave smile of greeting, he bent his head and resumed his seat.\r\nThey joined hands in turn with each of the six senators present, bowed\r\ntheir farewells in silence, and then went back with their host to the\r\ncar.\r\n\r\nThey ran down the avenue, made a curving sweep round to the left--for\r\nall the paths in the great square were laid in curves, apparently to\r\nform a contrast to the straight streets--and presently stopped before\r\nthe porch of one of the hundred palaces which surrounded it. This was\r\ntheir host's house, and their home during the rest of their sojourn on\r\nGanymede.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe period of Ganymede's revolution round its gigantic primary is seven\r\ndays, three hours, and forty-three minutes, practically a terrestrial\r\nweek, and on their return to their native world both the daring\r\nnavigators of Space described this as the most interesting and\r\ndelightful week in their lives, excepting always the period which they\r\nspent in the Eden of the Morning Star. Yet in one sense, it was even\r\nmore interesting.\r\n\r\nThere the inhabitants had never learnt to sin; here they had learnt the\r\nlesson that sin is mere foolishness, and that no really sensible or\r\nproperly educated man or woman thinks crime worth committing.\r\n\r\nThe life of the Crystal Cities, of which they visited four in different\r\nparts of the satellite, using the _Astronef_ as their vehicle, was one\r\nof peaceful industry and calm, innocent enjoyment. It was quite plain\r\nthat their first impressions of this aged world were correct. Outside\r\nthe cities spread a universal desert on which life was impossible. There\r\nwas hardly any moisture in the thin atmosphere. The rivers had dwindled\r\ninto rivulets and the seas into vast, shallow marshes. The heat received\r\nfrom the Sun was only about a twenty-fifth of that which falls on the\r\nsurface of the Earth, and this was drawn to the cities and collected and\r\npreserved under their glass domes by a number of devices which displayed\r\nsuperhuman intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe dwindling supplies of water were hoarded in vast subterranean\r\nreservoirs, and, by means of a perfect system of redistillation, the\r\npriceless fluid was used over and over again both for human purposes and\r\nfor irrigating the land within the cities. Still the total quantity was\r\nsteadily diminishing, for it was not only evaporating from the surface,\r\nbut, as the orb cooled more and more rapidly towards its centre, it\r\ndescended deeper and deeper below the surface, and could now only be\r\nreached by means of marvellously constructed borings and pumping\r\nmachinery which extended several miles below the surface.\r\n\r\nThe fast-failing store of heat in the centre of the little world, which\r\nhad now cooled through more than half its bulk, was utilised for warming\r\nthe air of the cities, and to drive the machinery which propelled it\r\nthrough the streets and squares. All work was done by electric energy\r\ndeveloped directly from this source, which also actuated the repulsive\r\nengines which had prevented the _Astronef_ from descending.\r\n\r\nIn short, the inhabitants of Ganymede were engaged in a steady,\r\nceaseless struggle to utilise the expiring natural forces of their world\r\nto prolong their own lives and the exquisitely refined civilisation to\r\nwhich they had attained to the latest possible date. They were, indeed,\r\nin exactly the same position in which the distant descendants of the\r\nhuman race may one day be expected to find themselves.\r\n\r\nTheir domestic life, as Zaidie and Redgrave saw it while they were the\r\nguests of their host, was the perfection of simplicity and comfort, and\r\ntheir public life was characterised by a quiet but intense\r\nintellectuality which, as Zaidie had said, made them feel very much like\r\nchildren who had only just learnt to speak.\r\n\r\nAs they possessed magnificent telescopes, far surpassing any on Earth,\r\ntheir guests were able to survey, not only the Solar System, but the\r\nother systems far beyond its limits as no others of their kind had ever\r\nbeen able to do before. They did not look through or into the\r\ntelescopes. The lens was turned upon the object, and this was thrown,\r\nenormously magnified, upon screens of what looked something like ground\r\nglass some fifty feet square. It was thus that they saw, not only the\r\nwhole visible surface of Jupiter as he revolved above them and they\r\nabout him, but also their native Earth, sometimes a pale silver disc or\r\ncrescent close to the edge of the Sun, visible only in the morning and\r\nthe evening of Jupiter, and at other times like a little black spot\r\ncrossing the glowing surface.\r\n\r\nBut there was another development of the science of the Crystal Cities\r\nwhich interested them far more than this--for after all they could not\r\nonly see the Worlds of Space for themselves, but circumnavigate them if\r\nthey chose.\r\n\r\nDuring their stay they were shown on these same screens the pictorial\r\nhistory of the world whose guests they were. These pictures, which they\r\nrecognised as an immeasurable development of what is called the\r\ncinematograph process on Earth, extended through the whole gamut of the\r\nsatellite's life. They formed, in fact, the means by which the children\r\nof Ganymede were taught the history of their world.\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, inevitable that the _Astronef_ should prove an object\r\nof intense interest to their hosts. They had solved the problem of the\r\nResolution of Forces, as Professor Rennick had done, and, as they were\r\nshown pictorially, a vessel had been made which embodied the principles\r\nof attraction and repulsion. It had risen from the surface of Ganymede,\r\nand then, possibly because its engines could not develop sufficient\r\nrepulsive force, the tremendous pull of the giant planet had dragged it\r\naway. It had vanished through the cloud-belts towards the flaming\r\nsurface beneath--and the experiment had never been repeated.\r\n\r\nHere, however, was a vessel which had actually, as Redgrave had\r\nconvinced his hosts by means of celestial maps and drawings of his own,\r\nleft a planet close to the Sun, and safely crossed the tremendous gulf\r\nof six hundred and fifty million miles which separated Jupiter from the\r\ncentre of the system. Moreover, he had twice proved her powers by taking\r\nhis host and two of his newly-made friends, the chief astronomers of\r\nGanymede, on a short trip across Space to Calisto and Europa, the second\r\nsatellite of Jupiter, which, to their very grave interest, they found\r\nhad already passed the stage in which Ganymede was, and had lapsed into\r\nthe icy silence of death.\r\n\r\nIt was these two journeys which led to the last adventure of the\r\n_Astronef_ in the Jovian System. Both Redgrave and Zaidie had\r\ndetermined, at whatever risk, to pass through the cloud-belts of\r\nJupiter, and catch a glimpse, if only a glimpse, of a world in the\r\nmaking. Their host and the two astronomers, after a certain amount of\r\nquiet discussion, accepted their invitation to accompany them, and on\r\nthe morning of the eighth day after their landing on Ganymede, the\r\n_Astronef_ rose from the plain outside the Crystal City, and directed\r\nher course towards the centre of the vast disc of Jupiter.\r\n\r\nShe was followed by the telescopes of all the observatories until she\r\nvanished through the brilliant cloud-band, eighty-five thousand miles\r\nlong and some five thousand miles broad, which stretched from east to\r\nwest of the planet. At the same moment the voyagers lost sight of\r\nGanymede and his sister satellites.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the interior of the _Astronef_ began to rise as soon\r\nas the upper cloud-belt was passed. Under this, spread out a vast field\r\nof brown-red cloud, rent here and there into holes and gaps like those\r\nstorm-cavities in the atmosphere of the Sun, which are commonly known as\r\nsun-spots. This lower stratum of cloud appeared to be the scene of\r\nterrific storms, compared with which the fiercest earthly tempests were\r\nmere zephyrs.\r\n\r\nAfter falling some five hundred miles further they found themselves\r\nsurrounded by what seemed an ocean of fire, but still the internal\r\ntemperature had only risen from seventy to ninety-five. The engines were\r\nwell under control. Only about a fourth of the total R. Force was being\r\ndeveloped, and the _Astronef_ was dropping swiftly, but steadily.\r\n\r\nRedgrave, who was in the conning-tower controlling the engines, beckoned\r\nto Zaidie and said:\r\n\r\n\"Shall we go on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"Now we've got as far as this I want to see what\r\nJupiter is like, and where you are not afraid to go, I'll go.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I'm afraid at all it's only because you are with me, Zaidie,\" he\r\nreplied, \"but I've only got a fourth of the power turned on yet, so\r\nthere's plenty of margin.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Astronef_, therefore, continued to sink through what seemed to be a\r\nfathomless ocean of whirling, blazing clouds, and the internal\r\ntemperature went on rising slowly but steadily. Their guests, without\r\nshowing the slightest sign of any emotion, walked about the upper deck\r\nnow, singly and now together, apparently absorbed by the strange scene\r\nabout them.\r\n\r\nAt length, after they had been dropping for some five hours by\r\n_Astronef_ time, one of them, uttering a sharp exclamation, pointed to\r\nan enormous rift about fifty miles away. A dull, red glare was streaming\r\nup out of it. The next moment the brown cloud-floor beneath them seemed\r\nto split up into enormous wreaths of vapour, which whirled up on all\r\nsides of them, and a few minutes later they caught their first glimpse\r\nof the true surface of Jupiter.\r\n\r\nIt lay, as nearly as they could judge, some two thousand miles beneath\r\nthem, a distance which the telescopes reduced to less than twenty; and\r\nthey saw for a few moments the world that was in the making. Through\r\nfloating seas of misty steam they beheld what seemed to them to be vast\r\ncontinents shape themselves and melt away into oceans of flames. Whole\r\nmountain ranges of glowing lava were hurled up miles high to take shape\r\nfor an instant and then fall away again, leaving fathomless gulfs of\r\nfiery mist in their place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Whole mountain ranges of glowing lava were hurled up\r\nmiles high._]\r\n\r\n\r\nThen waves of molten matter rose up again out of the gulfs, tens of\r\nmiles high and hundreds of miles long, surged forward, and met with a\r\nconcussion like that of millions of earthly thunder-clouds. Minute after\r\nminute they remained writhing and struggling with each other, flinging\r\nup spurts of flaming matter far above their crests. Other waves followed\r\nthem, climbing up their bases as a sea-surge runs up the side of a\r\nsmooth, slanting rock. Then from the midst of them a jet of living fire\r\nleapt up hundreds of miles into the lurid atmosphere above, and then,\r\nwith a crash and a roar which shook the vast Jovian firmament, the\r\nbattling lava-waves would split apart and sink down into the\r\nall-surrounding fire-ocean, like two grappling giants who had strangled\r\neach other in their final struggle.\r\n\r\n\"It's just Hell let loose!\" said Murgatroyd to himself as he looked down\r\nupon the terrific scene through one of the port-holes of the\r\nengine-room; \"and, with all respect to my lord and her ladyship, those\r\nthat come this near almost deserve to stop in it.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Redgrave and Zaidie and their three guests were so absorbed\r\nin the tremendous spectacle, that for a few moments no one noticed that\r\nthey were dropping faster and faster towards the world which Murgatroyd,\r\naccording to his lights, had not inaptly described. As for Zaidie, all\r\nher fears were for the time being lost in wonder, until she saw her\r\nhusband take a swift glance round upwards and downwards, and then go up\r\ninto the conning-tower. She followed him quickly, and said:\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter, Lenox, are we falling too quickly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Much faster than we should,\" he replied, sending a signal to Murgatroyd\r\nto increase the force by three-tenths.\r\n\r\nThe answering signal came back, but still the _Astronef_ continued to\r\nfall with terrific rapidity, and the awful landscape beneath them--a\r\nlandscape of fire and chaos--broadened out and became more and more\r\ndistinct.\r\n\r\nHe sent two more signals down in quick succession. Three-fourths of the\r\nwhole repulsive power of the engines was now being exerted--a force\r\nwhich would have been sufficient to hurl the _Astronef_ up from the\r\nsurface of the Earth like a feather in a whirlwind. Her downward course\r\nbecame a little slower, but still she did not stop. Zaidie, white to the\r\nlips, looked down upon the hideous scene beneath and slipped her hand\r\nthrough Redgrave's arm. He looked at her for an instant and then turned\r\nhis head away with a jerk, and sent down the last signal.\r\n\r\nThe whole energy of the engines was now directing the maximum of the R.\r\nForce against the surface of Jupiter, but still, as every moment passed\r\nin a speechless agony of apprehension, it grew nearer and nearer. The\r\nfire-waves mounted higher and higher, the roar of the fiery surges grew\r\nlouder and louder. Then in a momentary lull, he put his arm round her,\r\ndrew her close up to him and kissed her and said:\r\n\r\n\"That's all we can do, dear. We've come too close and he's too strong\r\nfor us.\"\r\n\r\nShe returned his kiss and said quite steadily:\r\n\r\n\"Well, at any rate, I'm with you, and it won't last long, will it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not very long now, I'm afraid,\" he said between his clenched teeth. And\r\nthen he pulled her close to him again, and together they looked down\r\ninto the storm-tossed hell towards which they were falling at the rate\r\nof nearly a hundred miles a minute.\r\n\r\nAlmost the next moment they felt a little jerk beneath their feet--a\r\njerk upwards; and Redgrave shook himself out of the half stupor into\r\nwhich he was falling and said:\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, what's that? I believe we're stopping--yes, we are--and we're\r\nbeginning to rise, too. Look, dear, the clouds are coming down upon\r\nus--fast too! I wonder what sort of miracle that is. Ay, what's the\r\nmatter, little woman?\"\r\n\r\nZaidie's head had dropped heavily on his shoulder. A glance showed him\r\nthat she had fainted. He could do nothing more in the conning-tower, so\r\nhe picked her up and carried her towards the companion-way, past his\r\nthree guests, who were standing in the middle of the upper deck round a\r\ntable on which lay a large sheet of paper.\r\n\r\nHe took her below and laid her on her bed, and in a few minutes he had\r\nbrought her to and told her that it was all right. Then he gave her a\r\ndrink of brandy-and-water and went back to the upper deck. As he reached\r\nthe top of the stairway one of the astronomers came towards him with a\r\nsheet of paper in his hand, smiling gravely, and pointing to a sketch\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nHe took the paper under one of the electric lights and looked at it. The\r\nsketch was a plan of the Jovian System. There were some signs written\r\nalong one side, which he did not understand, but he divined that they\r\nwere calculations. Still, there was no mistaking the diagram. There was\r\na circle representing the huge bulk of Jupiter; there were four smaller\r\ncircles at varying distances in a nearly straight line from it, and\r\nbetween the nearest of these and the planet was the figure of the\r\n_Astronef_, with an arrow pointing upwards.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I see!\" he said, forgetting for a moment that the other did not\r\nunderstand him, \"that was the miracle! The four satellites came into\r\nline with us just as the pull of Jupiter was getting too much for our\r\nengines, and their combined pull just turned the scale. Well, thank God\r\nfor that, sir, for in a few minutes more we should have been cinders!\"\r\n\r\nThe astronomer smiled again as he took the paper back. Meanwhile the\r\n_Astronef_ was rushing upward like a meteor through the clouds. In ten\r\nminutes the limits of the Jovian atmosphere were passed. Stars and suns\r\nand planets blazed out of the black vault of Space, and the great disc\r\nof the World that Is to Be once more covered the floor of Space beneath\r\nthem--an ocean of cloud, covering continents of lava and seas of flame,\r\nthe scene of the natal throes of a world which some day will be.\r\n\r\nThey passed Io and Europa, which changed from new to full moons as they\r\nsped by towards the Sun, and then the golden yellow crescent of Ganymede\r\nalso began to fill out to the half and full disc, and by the tenth hour\r\nof Earth-time, after they had risen from its surface, the _Astronef_ was\r\nonce more lying beside the gate of the Crystal City.\r\n\r\nAt midnight on the second night after their return, the ringed shape of\r\nSaturn, attended by his eight satellites, hung in the zenith\r\nmagnificently inviting. The _Astronef's_ engines had been replenished\r\nafter the exhaustion of their struggle with the might of Jupiter. They\r\nsaid farewell to their friends of the dying world. The doors of the\r\nair-chamber closed. The signal tinkled in the engine-room, and a few\r\nmoments later a blurr of white lights on the brown background of the\r\nsurrounding desert was all they could see of the Crystal City under\r\nwhose domes they had seen and learnt so much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe relative position of the two giants of the Solar System at the\r\nmoment when the _Astronef_ left the surface of Ganymede, was such that\r\nshe had to make a journey of rather more than 340,000,000 miles before\r\nshe passed within the confines of the Saturnine System.\r\n\r\nAt first her speed, as shown by the observations which Redgrave took\r\nwith the instruments which Professor Rennick had designed for the\r\npurpose, was comparatively slow. This was due to the tremendous pull of\r\nJupiter and its four moons on the fabric of the vessel. The backward\r\ndrag rapidly decreased as the pull of Saturn and his system began to\r\novermaster that of Jupiter.\r\n\r\nIt so happened, too, that Uranus, the next outer planet of the Solar\r\nSystem, 1,700,000,000 miles away from the Sun, was approaching its\r\nconjunction with Saturn, and so assisted in producing a constant\r\nacceleration of speed.\r\n\r\nJupiter and his satellites dropped behind, sinking, as it seemed to the\r\nwanderers, down into the bottomless gulf of Space, but still forming by\r\nfar the most brilliant and splendid object in the skies. The far-distant\r\nSun, which, seen from the Saturnian System, has only about a nineteenth\r\nof the superficial extent which it presents to the Earth, dwindled away\r\nrapidly until it began to look like a huge planet, with the Earth,\r\nVenus, Mars, and Mercury as satellites. Beyond the orbit of Saturn,\r\nUranus, with his eight moons, was shining with the lustre of a star of\r\nthe first magnitude, and far above and beyond him again hung the pale\r\ndisc of Neptune, the Outer Guard of the Solar System, separated from the\r\nSun by a gulf of more than 2,750,000,000 miles.\r\n\r\nWhen two-thirds of the distance between Jupiter and Saturn had been\r\ntraversed, Ringed Orb lay beneath them like a vast globe surrounded by\r\nan enormous circular ocean of many-coloured fire, divided, as it were,\r\nby circular shores of shade and darkness. On the side opposite to them a\r\ngigantic conical shadow extended beyond the confines of the ocean of\r\nlight. It was the shadow of half the globe of Saturn cast by the Sun\r\nacross his rings. Three little dark spots were also travelling across\r\nthe surface of the rings. They were the shadows of Mimas, Enceladus, and\r\nTethys, the three inner satellites. Japetus, the most distant, which\r\nrevolves at a distance ten times greater than that of the Moon from the\r\nEarth, was rising to their left above the edge of the rings, a pale,\r\nyellow, little disc shining feebly against the black background of\r\nSpace. The rest of the eight satellites were hidden behind the enormous\r\nbulk of the planet and the infinitely vaster area of the rings.\r\n\r\nDay after day Zaidie and her husband had been exhausting the\r\npossibilities of the English language in attempting to describe to each\r\nother the multiplying marvels of the wondrous scene which they were\r\napproaching at a speed of more than a hundred miles a second, and at\r\nlength Zaidie, after nearly an hour's absolute silence, during which\r\nthey sat with eyes fastened to their telescopes, looked up and said:\r\n\r\n\"It's no use, Lenox, all the fine words that we've been trying to think\r\nof have just been wasted. The angels may have a language that you could\r\ndescribe that in, but we haven't. If it wouldn't be something like\r\nblasphemy I should drop down to the commonplace, and call Saturn a\r\ncelestial spinning-top, with bands of light and shadow instead of\r\ncolours all round it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all a bad simile either,\" laughed Redgrave, as he got up from\r\nhis chair with a yawn and a stretch of his long limbs, \"still, it's as\r\nwell that you said celestial, for, after all, that's about the best word\r\nwe've found yet. Certainly the Ringed World is the most nearly heavenly\r\nthing we've seen so far.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" he went on, \"I think it's about time we were stopping this\r\nheadlong fall of ours. Do you see how the landscape is spreading out\r\nround us? That means that we are dropping pretty fast. Whereabouts would\r\nyou like to land? At present we're heading straight for Saturn's north\r\npole.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I'd rather see what the rings are like first,\" said Zaidie;\r\n\"couldn't we go across them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly we can,\" he replied, \"only we'll have to be a bit careful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Careful, what of--collisions? Are you thinking of Proctor's hypothesis\r\nthat the rings are formed of multitudes of tiny satellites?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but I should go a little farther than that, I should say that his\r\nrings and his eight satellites are to Saturn what the planets generally\r\nand the ring of the Asteroides are to the Sun, and if that is the\r\ncase--I mean if we find the rings made up of myriads of tiny bodies\r\nflying round with Saturn--it might get a bit risky.\r\n\r\n\"You see the outside ring is a bit over 160,000 miles across, and it\r\nrevolves in less than eleven hours. In other words we might find the\r\nring a sort of celestial maelstrom, and if we once got into the whirl,\r\nand Saturn exerted his full pull on us, we might become a satellite,\r\ntoo, and go on swinging round with the rest for a good bit of eternity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well then,\" she said, \"of course we don't want to do anything of\r\nthat sort, but there's something else I think we could do,\" she went on,\r\ntaking up a copy of Proctor's \"Saturn and its System,\" which she had\r\nbeen reading just after breakfast. \"You see those rings are, all\r\ntogether, about 10,000 miles broad; there's a gap of about 1,700 miles\r\nbetween the big dark one and the middle bright one, and it's nearly\r\n10,000 miles from the edge of the bright ring to the surface of Saturn.\r\nNow why shouldn't we get in between the inner ring and the planet? If\r\nProctor was right and the rings are made of tiny satellites and there\r\nare myriads of them, of course they'll pull up while Saturn pulls down.\r\nIn fact Flammarion says somewhere that along Saturn's equator there is\r\nno weight at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite possible,\" replied Redgrave, \"and, if you like, we'll go and\r\nprove it. Of course, if the _Astronef_ weighs absolutely nothing between\r\nSaturn and the rings, we can easily get away. The only thing that I\r\nobject to is getting into this 170,000-mile vortex, being whizzed round\r\nwith Saturn every ten and a half hours, and sauntering round the Sun at\r\n21,000 miles an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't!\" she said. \"Really it isn't good to think about these things,\r\nsituated as we are. Fancy, in a single year of Saturn there are nearly\r\n25,000 Earth-days. Why, we should each of us be about thirty years older\r\nwhen we got round, even if we lived, which, of course, we shouldn't. By\r\nthe way, how long could we live for, if the worst came to the worst?\"\r\n\r\n\"Given water, about one Earth-year at the outside;\" \"but, of course, we\r\nshall be home long before that.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we don't become one of the satellites of Saturn,\" she replied, \"or\r\nget dragged away by something into the outer depths of Space.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the downward speed of the _Astronef_ had been considerably\r\nchecked. The vast circle of the rings seemed to suddenly expand, and\r\nsoon it covered the whole floor of the Vault of Space.\r\n\r\nAs she dropped towards what might be called the limit of the northern\r\ntropic of Saturn, the spectacle presented by the rings became every\r\nminute more and more marvellous--purple and silver, black and gold,\r\ndotted with myriads of brilliant points of many-coloured light, they\r\nstretched upwards like vast rainbows into the Saturnian sky as the\r\n_Astronef's_ position changed with regard to the horizon of the planet.\r\nThe nearer they approached the surface, the nearer the gigantic arch of\r\nthe many-coloured rings approached the zenith. Sun and stars sank down\r\nbehind it, for now they were dropping through the fifteen-year-long\r\ntwilight that reigns over that portion of the globe of Saturn which,\r\nduring half of his year of thirty terrestrial years, is turned away from\r\nthe Sun.\r\n\r\nThe further they fell towards the rings the more certain it became that\r\nthe theory of the great English astronomer was the correct one. Seen\r\nthrough the telescopes at a distance of only thirty or forty thousand\r\nmiles, it became perfectly plain that the outer or darker ring as seen\r\nfrom the Earth was composed of myriads of tiny bodies so far separated\r\nfrom each other that the rayless blackness of Space could be seen\r\nthrough them.\r\n\r\n\"It's quite evident,\" said Redgrave, after a long look through his\r\ntelescope, \"that those are rings of what we should call meteorites on\r\nEarth, atoms of matter which Saturn threw off into Space after the\r\nsatellites were formed.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I shouldn't wonder, if you will excuse my interrupting you,\" said\r\nZaidie, \"if the moons themselves have been made up of a lot of these\r\nthings going together when they were only gas, or nebula, or something\r\nof that sort. In fact, when Saturn was a good deal younger than he is\r\nnow, he may have had a lot more rings and no moons, and now these\r\naerolites, or whatever they are, can't come together and make moons,\r\nbecause they've got too solid.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the _Astronef_ was rapidly approaching that portion of\r\nSaturn's surface which was illuminated by the rays of the Sun, streaming\r\nunder the lower arch of the inner ring.\r\n\r\nAs they passed under it the whole scene suddenly changed. The rings\r\nvanished. Overhead was an arch of brilliant light a hundred miles thick,\r\nspanning the whole of the visible heavens. Below lay the sunlit surface\r\nof Saturn divided into light and dark bands of enormous breadth.\r\n\r\nThe band immediately below them was of a brilliant silver-grey, very\r\nmuch like the central zone of Jupiter. North of this on the one side\r\nstretched the long shadow of the rings, and southward other bands of\r\nalternating white and gold and deep purple succeeded each other till\r\nthey were lost in the curvature of the vast planet. The poles were of\r\ncourse invisible since the _Astronef_ was now too near the surface; but\r\non their approach they had seen unmistakable evidence of snow and ice.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were exactly under the Ring-arch, Redgrave shut off the\r\nR. Force, and, somewhat to their astonishment, the _Astronef_ began to\r\nrevolve slowly on its axis, giving them the idea that the Saturnian\r\nSystem was revolving round them. The arch seemed to sink beneath their\r\nfeet while the belts of the planet rose above them.\r\n\r\n\"What on earth is the matter?\" said Zaidie. \"Everything has gone upside\r\ndown.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which shows,\" replied Redgrave, \"that as soon as the _Astronef_ became\r\nneutral the rings pulled harder than the planet, I suppose because we're\r\nso near to them, and, instead of falling on to Saturn, we shall have to\r\npush up at him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, I see that,\" said Zaidie, \"but after all it does look a little\r\nbit bewildering, doesn't it, to be on your feet one minute and on your\r\nhead the next?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, rather; but you ought to be getting accustomed to that sort of\r\nthing now. In a few minutes neither you, nor I, nor anything else will\r\nhave any weight. We shall be just between the attraction of the rings\r\nand Saturn, so you'd better go and sit down, for if you were to give a\r\nbit of an extra spring in walking you might be knocking that pretty head\r\nof yours against the roof,\" said Redgrave, as he went to turn the R.\r\nForce on to the edge of the rings.\r\n\r\nA vast sea of silver cloud seemed now to descend upon them. Then they\r\nentered it, and for nearly half an hour the _Astronef_ was totally\r\nenveloped in a sea of pearl-grey luminous mist.\r\n\r\n\"Atmosphere!\" said Redgrave, as he went to the conning-tower and\r\nsignalled to Murgatroyd to start the propellers. They continued to rise\r\nand the mist began to drift past them in patches, showing that the\r\npropellers were driving them ahead.\r\n\r\nThey now rose swiftly towards the surface of the planet. The cloud-wrack\r\ngot thinner and thinner, and presently they found themselves floating in\r\na clear atmosphere between two seas of cloud, the one above them being\r\nmuch less dense than the one below.\r\n\r\n\"I believe we shall see Saturn on the other side of that,\" said Zaidie,\r\nlooking up at it. \"Oh dear, there we are going round again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Reaching the point of neutral attraction,\" said Redgrave; \"once more\r\nyou'd better sit down in case of accidents.\"\r\n\r\nInstead of dropping into her deck-chair as she would have done on Earth,\r\nshe took hold of the arms and pulled herself into it, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Really, it seems rather absurd to have to do this sort of thing. Fancy\r\nhaving to hold yourself into a chair. I suppose I hardly weigh anything\r\nat all now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much,\" said Redgrave, stooping down and taking hold of the end of\r\nthe chair with both hands. Without any apparent effort he raised her\r\nabout five feet from the floor, and held her there while the _Astronef_\r\nmade another revolution. For a moment he let go, and she and the chair\r\nfloated between the roof and the floor of the deck-chamber. Then he\r\npulled the chair away from under her, and as the floor of the vessel\r\nonce more turned towards Saturn, he took hold of her hands and brought\r\nher to her feet on deck again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Without any apparent effort he raised her about five\r\nfeet from the floor._]\r\n\r\n\"I ought to have had a photograph of you like that!\" he laughed. \"I\r\nwonder what they'd think of it at home?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you had taken one I should certainly have broken the negative. The\r\nvery idea--a photograph of me standing on nothing! Besides, they'd never\r\nbelieve it on Earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"We might have got old Andrew to make an affidavit as to the true\r\ncircumstances,\" he began.\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk nonsense, Lenox! Look! there's something much more\r\ninteresting. There's Saturn at last. Now I wonder if we shall find any\r\nsort of life there--and shall we be able to breathe the air?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hardly think so,\" he said, as the _Astronef_ dropped slowly through\r\nthe thin cloud-veil. \"You know spectrum analysis has proved that there\r\nis a gas in Saturn's atmosphere which we know nothing about, and,\r\nhowever good it may be for the Saturnians, it's not very likely that it\r\nwould agree with us, so I think we'd better be content with our own.\r\nBesides, the atmosphere is so enormously dense that even if we could\r\nbreathe it it might squash us up. You see we're only accustomed to\r\nfifteen pounds on the square inch, and it may be hundreds of pounds\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Zaidie, \"I haven't got any particular desire to be\r\nflattened out, or squeezed dry like an orange. It's not at all a nice\r\nidea, is it? But look, Lenox,\" she went on, pointing downwards, \"surely\r\nthis isn't air at all, or at least it's something between air and water.\r\nAren't those things swimming about in it--something like fish in the\r\nsea? They can't be clouds, and they aren't either fish or birds. They\r\ndon't fly or float. Well, this is certainly more wonderful than anything\r\nelse we've seen, though it doesn't look very pleasant. They're not\r\nnice-looking, are they? I wonder if they are at all dangerous!\"\r\n\r\nWhile she was saying this Zaidie had gone to her telescope, and was\r\nsweeping the surface of Saturn, which was now about a hundred miles\r\ndistant. Her husband was doing the same. In fact, for the time being\r\nthey were all eyes, for they were looking on a stranger sight than man\r\nor woman had ever seen before.\r\n\r\nUnderneath the inner cloud-veil the atmosphere of Saturn appeared to\r\nthem somewhat as the lower depths of the ocean would appear to a diver,\r\ngranted that he was able to see for hundreds of miles about him. Its\r\ncolour was a pale greenish yellow. The outside thermometers showed that\r\nthe temperature was a hundred and seventy-five Fahrenheit. In fact, the\r\ninterior of the _Astronef_ was getting uncomfortably like a Turkish\r\nbath, and Redgrave took the opportunity of at once freshening and\r\ncooling the air by releasing a little oxygen from the cylinders.\r\n\r\nFrom what they could see of the surface of Saturn it seemed to be a dead\r\nlevel, greyish brown in colour, and not divided into oceans and\r\ncontinents. In fact there were no signs whatever of water within range\r\nof their telescopes. There was nothing that looked like cities, or any\r\nhuman habitations, but the ground, as they got nearer to it, seemed to\r\nbe covered with a very dense vegetable growth, not unlike gigantic forms\r\nof seaweed, and of somewhat the same colour. In fact, as Zaidie\r\nremarked, the surface of Saturn was not at all unlike what the floors of\r\nthe ocean of the Earth might be if they were laid bare.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that the life of this portion of Saturn was not what, for\r\nwant of a more exact word, might be called terrestrial. Its inhabitants,\r\nhowever they were constituted, floated about in the depths of this\r\nsemi-gaseous ocean as the denizens of earthly seas did in the\r\nterrestrial oceans. Already their telescopes enabled them to make out\r\nenormous moving shapes, black and grey-brown and pale red, swimming\r\nabout, evidently by their own volition, rising and falling and often\r\nsinking down on to the gigantic vegetation which covered the surface,\r\npossibly for the purpose of feeding. But it was also evident that they\r\nresembled the inhabitants of earthly oceans in another respect, since it\r\nwas easy to see that they preyed upon each other.\r\n\r\n\"I don't like the look of those creatures at all,\" said Zaidie, when the\r\n_Astronef_ had come to a stop and was floating about ten miles above the\r\nsurface. \"They're altogether too uncanny. They look to me something like\r\njelly-fish about the size of whales, only they have eyes and mouths. Did\r\nyou ever see such awful-looking eyes, bigger than soup-plates and as\r\nbright as a cat's. I suppose that's because of the dim light. And the\r\nnasty wormy sort of way they swim, or fly, or whatever it is. Lenox, I\r\ndon't know what the rest of Saturn may be like, but I certainly don't\r\nlike this part. It's quite too creepy and unearthly for my taste. Look\r\nat the horrors fighting and eating each other. That's the only bit of\r\nearthly character they've got about them; the big ones eating the little\r\nones. I hope they won't take the _Astronef_ for something nice to eat.\"\r\n\r\n\"They'd find her a pretty tough morsel if they did,\" laughed Redgrave,\r\n\"but still we may as well get some steering way on her in case of\r\naccident.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nA few moments later he sent a signal to Murgatroyd in the engine-room.\r\nThe propellers began to revolve slowly, beating the dense air and\r\ndriving the _Astronef_ at a speed of about twenty miles an hour through\r\nthe depths of this strangely peopled ocean.\r\n\r\nThey approached nearer and nearer to the surface, and as they did so the\r\nuncanny creatures about them grew more and more numerous. They were\r\ncertainly the most extraordinary living things that human eyes had ever\r\nlooked upon. Zaidie's comparison to the whale and the jelly-fish was by\r\nno means incorrect; only when they got near enough to them they found,\r\nto their astonishment, that they were double-headed--that is to say,\r\nthey had a head with a mouth, nostrils, ear-holes, and eyes at each end\r\nof their bodies.\r\n\r\nThe larger of the creatures appeared to have a certain amount of respect\r\nfor each other. Now and then they witnessed a battle-royal between two\r\nof the monsters who were pursuing the same prey. Their method of attack\r\nwas as follows: The assailant would rise above his opponent or prey, and\r\nthen, dropping on to its back, envelop it and begin tearing at its sides\r\nand under parts with huge beak-like jaws, somewhat resembling those of\r\nthe largest kind of the earthly octopus, only infinitely more\r\nformidable. The substance composing their bodies appeared to be not\r\nunlike that of a terrestrial jelly-fish, but much denser. It seemed from\r\ntheir motions to have the tenacity of soft indiarubber save at the\r\nheaded ends, where it was much harder. The necks were protected for\r\nabout fifty feet by huge scales of a dull, greenish hue.\r\n\r\nWhen one of them had overpowered an enemy or a victim the two sank down\r\ninto the vegetation, and the victor began to eat the vanquished. Their\r\nmeans of locomotion consisted of huge fins, or rather half-fins,\r\nhalf-wings, of which they had three laterally arranged behind each head,\r\nand four much longer and narrower, above and below, which seemed to be\r\nused mainly for steering purposes.\r\n\r\nThey moved with equal ease in either direction, and they appeared to\r\nrise or fall by inflating or deflating the middle portions of their\r\nbodies, somewhat as fish do with their swimming bladders.\r\n\r\nThe light in the lower regions of this strange ocean was dimmer than\r\nearthly twilight, although the _Astronef_ was steadily making her way\r\nbeneath the arch of the rings towards the sunlit hemisphere.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what the effect of the searchlight would be on these fellows!\"\r\nsaid Redgrave. \"Those huge eyes of theirs are evidently only suited to\r\ndim light. Let's try and dazzle some of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope it won't be a case of the moths and the candle!\" said Zaidie.\r\n\"They don't seem to have taken much interest in us so far. Perhaps they\r\nhaven't been able to see properly, but suppose they were attracted by\r\nthe light and began crowding round us and fastening on to us, as the\r\nhorrible things do with each other. What should we do then? They might\r\ndrag us down and perhaps keep us there; but there's one thing, they'd\r\nnever eat us, because we could keep closed up and die respectably\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much fear of that, little woman,\" he said, \"we're too strong for\r\nthem. Hardened steel and toughened glass ought to be more than a match\r\nfor a lot of exaggerated jelly-fish like these,\" said Redgrave, as he\r\nswitched on the head searchlight. \"We've come here to see strange things\r\nand we may as well see them. Ah, would you, my friend. No, this is not\r\none of your sort, and it isn't meant to eat.\"\r\n\r\nAn enormous double-headed monster, apparently some four hundred feet\r\nlong, came floating towards them as the searchlight flashed out, and\r\nothers began instantly to crowd about them, just as Zaidie had feared.\r\n\r\n\"Lenox, for Heaven's sake be careful!\" cried Zaidie, shrinking up beside\r\nhim as the huge, hideous head, with its saucer eyes and enormous\r\nbeak-like jaws wide open, came towards them. \"And look! there are more\r\ncoming. Can't we go up and get away from them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute, little woman,\" replied Redgrave, who was beginning to\r\nfeel the passion of adventure thrilling along his nerves. \"If we fought\r\nthe Martian air fleet and licked it I think we can manage these things.\r\nLet's see how he likes the light.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he flashed the full glare of the five thousand candle-power\r\nlamp full on to the creature's great cat-like eyes. Instantly it bent\r\nitself up into an arc. The two heads, each the exact image of the other,\r\ncame together. The four eyes glared half-dazzled into the conning-tower,\r\nand the four fearful jaws snapped viciously together.\r\n\r\n\"Lenox, Lenox, for goodness' sake let us go up!\" cried Zaidie, shrinking\r\nstill closer to him. \"That thing's too horrible to look at.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a beast, isn't it?\" he said; \"but I think we can cut him in two\r\nwithout much trouble.\"\r\n\r\nHe signalled for full speed. The _Astronef_ ought to have sprung forward\r\nand driven her ram through the huge, brick-red body of the hideous\r\ncreature which was now only a couple of hundred yards from them; but\r\ninstead of that a slow, jarring, grinding thrill seemed to run through\r\nher, and she stopped. The next moment Murgatroyd put his head up through\r\nthe companion-way which led from the upper deck to the conning-tower,\r\nand said, in a tone whose calm indicated, as usual, resignation to the\r\nworst that could happen:\r\n\r\n\"My Lord, two of those beasts, fishes or live balloons, or whatever they\r\nare, have come across the propellers. They're cut up a good bit, but\r\nI've had to stop the engines, and they're clinging all round the after\r\npart. We're going down, too. Shall I disconnect the propellers and turn\r\non the repulsion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, certainly, Andrew!\" cried Zaidie, \"and all of it, too. Look,\r\nLenox, that horrible thing is coming. Suppose it broke the glass, and we\r\ncouldn't breathe this atmosphere!\"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke the enormous, double-headed body advanced until it\r\ncompletely enveloped the forward part of the _Astronef_. The two hideous\r\nheads came close to the sides of the conning-tower; the huge, palely\r\nluminous eyes looked in upon them. Zaidie, in her terror, even thought\r\nthat she saw something like human curiosity in them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The huge palely luminous eyes looked in upon them._]\r\n\r\nThen, as Murgatroyd disappeared to obey the orders which Redgrave had\r\nsanctioned with a quick nod, the heads approached still closer, and she\r\nheard the ends of the pointed jaws, which she now saw were armed with\r\nshark-like teeth, striking against the thick glass walls of the\r\nconning-tower.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be frightened, dear!\" he said, putting his arm round her, just as\r\nhe had done when they thought they were falling into the fiery seas of\r\nJupiter. \"You'll see something happen to this gentleman soon. Big and\r\nall as he is there won't be much left of him in a few minutes. They are\r\nlike those monsters they found in the lowest depths of our own seas.\r\nThey can only live under tremendous pressure. That's why we didn't find\r\nany of them up above. This chap'll burst like a bubble presently.\r\nMeanwhile, there's no use in stopping here. Suppose you go below and\r\nbrew some coffee and bring it up on deck while I go and see how things\r\nare looking aft. It doesn't do you any good, you know, to be looking at\r\nmonsters of this sort. You can see what's left of them later on. You\r\nmight bring the cognac decanter up too.\"\r\n\r\nZaidie was not at all sorry to obey him, for the horrible sight had\r\nalmost sickened her.\r\n\r\nThey were still under the arch of the rings, and so, when the full\r\nstrength of the R. Force was directed against the body of Saturn, the\r\nvessel sprang upwards like a projectile fired from a cannon.\r\n\r\nRedgrave went back into the conning-tower to see what happened to their\r\nassailant. It was already trying to detach itself and sink back into a\r\nmore congenial element. As the pressure of the atmosphere decreased its\r\nhuge body swelled up into still huger proportions. The scaly skin on the\r\ntwo heads and necks puffed up as though air was being pumped in under\r\nit. The great eyes protruded out of their sockets; the jaws opened\r\nwidely as though the creature were gasping for breath.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Murgatroyd was seeing something very similar at the after end,\r\nand wondering what was going to happen to his propellers, the blades of\r\nwhich were deeply imbedded in the jelly-like flesh of the monsters.\r\n\r\nThe _Astronef_ leaped higher and higher, and the hideous bodies which\r\nwere clinging to her swelled out huger and huger. Redgrave even fancied\r\nthat he heard something like the cries of pain from both heads on either\r\nside of the conning-tower. They passed through the inner cloud-veil, and\r\nthen the _Astronef_ began to turn on her axis, and, just as the outer\r\nenvelope came into view the enormously distended bulk of the monsters\r\ncollapsed, and their fragments, seeming now like the tatters of a burst\r\nballoon than portions of a once living creature, dropped from the body\r\nof the _Astronef_, and floated away down into what had been their native\r\nelement.\r\n\r\n\"Difference of environment means a lot, after all,\" said Redgrave to\r\nhimself. \"I should have called that either a lie or a miracle if I\r\nhadn't seen it, and I'm jolly glad I sent Zaidie down below.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here's your coffee, Lenox,\" said her voice from the upper deck the next\r\nmoment, \"only it doesn't seem to want to stop in the cups, and the cups\r\nkeep getting off the saucers. I suppose we're turning upside down\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nRedgrave stepped somewhat gingerly on to the deck, for his body had so\r\nlittle weight under the double attraction of Saturn and the Rings that a\r\nvery slight effort would have sent him flying up to the roof of the\r\ndeck-chamber.\r\n\r\n\"That's exactly as you please,\" he said, \"just hold that table steady a\r\nminute. We shall have our centre of gravity back soon. And now, as to\r\nthe main question, suppose we take a trip across the sunlit hemisphere\r\nof Saturn to, what I suppose we should call on Earth, the South Pole. We\r\ncan get resistance from the Rings, and as we are here we may as well see\r\nwhat the rest of Saturn is like. You see, if our theory is correct as to\r\nthe Rings gathering up most of the atmosphere of Saturn about its\r\nequator, we shall get to higher latitudes where the air is thinner and\r\nmore like our own, and therefore it's quite possible that we shall find\r\ndifferent forms of life in it too--or if you've had enough of Saturn and\r\nwould prefer a trip to Uranus----\"\r\n\r\n\"No, thanks,\" said Zaidie quickly. \"To tell you the truth, Lenox, I've\r\nhad almost enough star-wandering for one honeymoon, and though we've\r\nseen nice things as well as horrible things--especially those ghastly,\r\nslimy creatures down there--I'm beginning to feel a bit homesick for\r\ngood old Mother Earth. You see, we're nearly a thousand million miles\r\nfrom home, and, even with you, it makes one feel a bit lonely. I vote we\r\nexplore the rest of this hemisphere up to the pole, and then, as they\r\nsay at sea--I mean our sea--'bout ship, and try if we can find our own\r\nold world again. After all, it _is_ more homelike than any of these,\r\nisn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just take our telescope and look at it,\" said Redgrave, pointing\r\ntowards the Sun, with its little cluster of attendant planets. \"It looks\r\nsomething like one of Jupiter's little moons down there, doesn't it,\r\nonly not quite as big?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it does, but that doesn't matter. The fact is that it's there, and\r\nwe know what it's like, and it's _home_, if it _is_ a thousand million\r\nmiles away, and that's everything.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time they had passed through the outer band of clouds. The vast,\r\nsunlit arch of the Rings towered up to the zenith, apparently spanning\r\nthe whole visible heavens. Below and in front of them lay the enormous\r\nsemicircle of the hemisphere which was turned towards the Sun, shrouded\r\nby its many-coloured bands of clouds. The R. Force was directed strongly\r\nagainst the lower ring, and the _Astronef_ descended rapidly in a\r\nslanting direction through the cloud-bands towards the southern\r\ntemperate zone of the planet.\r\n\r\nThey passed through the second, or dark, cloud-band at the rate of about\r\nthree thousand miles an hour, aided by the repulsion against the Rings\r\nand the attraction of the planets, and soon after lunch, the materials\r\nof which now consented to remain on the table, they passed through the\r\nclouds and found themselves in a new world of wonders.\r\n\r\nOn a far vaster scale, it was the Earth during that period of its\r\ndevelopment which is called the Reptilian Age. The atmosphere was still\r\ndense and loaded with aqueous vapour, but the waters had already been\r\ndivided from the land.\r\n\r\nThey passed over vast, marshy continents and islands, and warm seas,\r\nabove which thin clouds of steam still hung, and as they swept southward\r\nwith the propellers working at their utmost speed they caught glimpses\r\nof giant forms rising out of the steamy waters near the land, of others\r\ncrawling slowly over it, dragging their huge bulk through a tremendous\r\nvegetation, which they crushed down as they passed, as a sheep on Earth\r\nmight push its way through a field of standing corn.\r\n\r\nOther and even stranger shapes, broad-winged and ungainly, fluttered\r\nwith a slow, bat-like motion through the lower strata of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then during the voyage across the temperate zone the\r\npropellers were slowed down to enable them to witness some Titanic\r\nconflict between the gigantic denizens of land and sea and air. But\r\nZaidie had had enough of horrors on the Saturnian equator, and so she\r\nwas content to watch this phase of evolution working itself out (as it\r\nhad done on the Earth thousands of ages ago) from a convenient distance.\r\nWherefore the _Astronef_ sped on without approaching the surface nearer\r\nthan was necessary to get a clear general view.\r\n\r\n\"It'll be all very nice to see and remember and dream about afterwards,\"\r\nshe said, \"but I don't think I can stand any more monsters just now, at\r\nleast not at close quarters, and I'm quite sure that if those things can\r\nlive there we couldn't, any more than we could have lived on Earth a\r\nmillion years or so ago. No, really I don't want to land, Lenox; let's\r\ngo on.\"\r\n\r\nThey went on at a speed of about a hundred miles an hour, and, as they\r\nprogressed southward, both the atmosphere and the landscape rapidly\r\nchanged. The air grew clearer and the clouds lighter. Land and sea were\r\nmore sharply divided, and both teeming with life. The seas still swarmed\r\nwith serpentine monsters of the saurian type, and the firmer lands were\r\npeopled by huge animals, mastodons, bears, giant tapirs, mylodons,\r\ndeinotheriums, and a score of other species too strange for them to\r\nrecognise by any Earthly likeness, which roamed in great herds through\r\nthe vast twilit forests and over boundless plains covered with grey-blue\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nHere, too, they found mountains for the first time on Saturn; mountains\r\nsteep-sided, and many Earth-miles high.\r\n\r\nAs the _Astronef_ was skirting the side of one of these ranges Redgrave\r\nallowed it to approach more closely than he had so far done to the\r\nsurface of Saturn.\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't wonder if we found some of the higher forms of life up\r\nhere,\" he said. \"If there is any kind of being that is going to develop\r\nsome day into the human race of Saturn it would naturally get up here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should hope so,\" said Zaidie, \"and just as far as possible out of the\r\nreach of those unutterable horrors on the equator. That would be one of\r\nthe first signs they would show of superior intelligence. Look! I\r\nbelieve there are some of them. Do you see those holes in the\r\nmountain-side there? And there they are, something like gorillas, only\r\ntwice as big, and up the trees, too--and what trees! They must be seven\r\nor eight hundred feet high.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tree-men and cave-dwellers, and ancestors of the future royal race of\r\nSaturn, I suppose!\" said Redgrave. \"They don't look very nice, do they?\r\nStill, there's no doubt about their being far superior in intelligence\r\nto those other brutes we saw. Evidently this atmosphere is too thin for\r\nthe two-headed jelly-fishes and the saurians to breathe. These creatures\r\nhave found that out in a few hundreds of generations, and so they have\r\ncome to live up here out of the way. Vegetarians, I suppose, or perhaps\r\nthey live on smaller monkeys and other animals, just as our ancestors\r\ndid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, Lenox,\" said Zaidie, turning round and facing him, \"I must say\r\nthat you have a most unpleasant way of alluding to one's ancestors. They\r\ncouldn't help what they were.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, dear,\" he said, going towards her, \"marvellous as the miracle\r\nseems, I'm heretic enough to believe it possible that your ancestors\r\neven, millions of years ago, perhaps, may have been something like\r\nthose; but then, of course, you know I'm a hopeless Darwinian.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, therefore, entirely horrid, as I've often said before, when you\r\nget on subjects like these. Not, of course, that I'm ashamed of my poor\r\nrelations; and then, after all, your Darwin was quite wrong when he\r\ntalked about the descent of man--and woman. We--especially the\r\nwomen--have _as_cended from that sort of thing, if there's any truth in\r\nthe story at all; though, personally, I must say I prefer dear old\r\nMother Eve.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who never had a sweeter daughter than----!\" he replied, drawing her\r\ntowards him.\r\n\r\n\"Very prettily put, my Lord,\" she laughed, releasing herself with a\r\ngentle twirl; \"and now I'll go and get dinner ready. After all, it\r\ndoesn't matter what world one's in, one gets hungry all the same.\"\r\n\r\nThe dinner, which was eaten somewhere in the middle of the\r\nfifteen-year-long day of Saturn, was a more than usually pleasant one,\r\nbecause they were now nearing the turning-point of their trip into the\r\ndepths of Space, and thoughts of home and friends were already beginning\r\nto fly back across the thousand-million-mile gulf which lay between them\r\nand the Earth which they had left only a little more than two months\r\nago.\r\n\r\nWhile they were at dinner the _Astronef_ rose above the mountains and\r\nresumed her southward course. Zaidie brought the coffee up on deck as\r\nusual after dinner, and, while Redgrave smoked his cigar and Zaidie her\r\ncigarette, they luxuriated in the magnificent spectacle of the sunlit\r\nside of the Rings towering up, rainbow built on rainbow, to the zenith\r\nof their visible heavens.\r\n\r\n\"What a pity there aren't any words to describe it!\" said Zaidie. \"I\r\nwonder if the descendants of the ancestors of the future human race on\r\nSaturn will invent anything like a suitable language. I wonder how\r\nthey'll talk about those Rings millions of years hence.\"\r\n\r\n\"By that time there may not be any Rings,\" Lenox replied, blowing one of\r\nblue smoke from his own lips. \"Look at that--made in a moment and gone\r\nin a moment--and yet on exactly the same principle, it gives one a dim\r\nidea of the difference between time and eternity. After all it's only\r\nanother example of Kelvin's theory of vortices. Nebulæ, and asteroids,\r\nand planet-rings, and smoke-rings are really all made on the same\r\nprinciple.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Lenox, if you're going to get as philosophical and as\r\ncommonplace as that, I'm going to bed. Now that I come to think of it,\r\nI've been up about fifteen Earth-hours, so it's about time I went and\r\nhad a sleep. It's your turn to make the coffee in the morning--our\r\nmorning, I mean--and you'll wake me in time to see the South Pole of\r\nSaturn, won't you? You're not coming yet, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not just yet, dear. I want to see a bit more of this, and then I must\r\ngo through the engines and see that they're all right and ready for that\r\nthousand million mile homeward voyage you're talking about. You can have\r\na good ten hours' sleep without missing much, I think, for there doesn't\r\nseem to be anything more interesting than our own Arctic life down\r\nthere. So good-night, little woman, and don't have too many nightmares.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-night!\" she said; \"if you hear me shout you'll know that you're to\r\ncome and protect me from monsters. Weren't those two-headed brutes just\r\ntoo horrid for words? Good-night, dear!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nA little before six (Earth time) on the fourth morning after they had\r\ncleared the confines of the Saturnian System, Redgrave went as usual\r\ninto the conning-tower to examine the instruments, and to see that\r\neverything was in order. To his intense surprise he found, on looking at\r\nthe gravitational compass, which was to the _Astronef_ what the ordinary\r\ncompass is to a ship at sea, that the vessel was a long way out of her\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nSuch a thing had never yet occurred. Up to now the _Astronef_ had obeyed\r\nthe laws of gravitation and repulsion with absolute exactness. He made\r\nanother examination of the instruments; but no, all were in perfect\r\norder.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what the deuce is the matter,\" he said, after he had looked\r\nfor a few moments with frowning eyes at the multitude of orbs ahead. \"By\r\nJove, we're swinging more. This is getting serious.\"\r\n\r\nHe went back to the compass. The long, slender needle was slowly\r\nswinging farther and farther out of the middle line of the vessel.\r\n\r\n\"There can only be two explanations of that,\" he went on, thrusting his\r\nhands deep into his trousers pockets; \"either the engines are not\r\nworking properly, or some enormous and invisible body is pulling us\r\ntowards it out of our course. Let's have a look at the engines first.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the engine-room he said to Murgatroyd, who was indulging\r\nin his usual pastime of cleaning and polishing his beloved charges:\r\n\r\n\"Have you noticed anything wrong during the last hour or so,\r\nMurgatroyd?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my Lord; at least not so far as concerns the engines. They're all\r\nright. Hark, now, they're not making more noise than a lady's sewing\r\nmachine,\" replied the old Yorkshireman, with a note of resentment in his\r\nvoice. The suspicion that anything could be wrong with his shining\r\ndarlings was almost a personal offence to him. \"But is anything the\r\nmatter, my Lord, if I might ask?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're a long way off our course, and for the life of me I can't\r\nunderstand it,\" replied Redgrave. \"There's nothing about here to pull us\r\nout of our line. Of course the stars--good Lord, I never thought of\r\nthat! Look here, Murgatroyd, not a word about this to her ladyship, and\r\nstand by to raise the power by degrees, as I signal to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, my lord. I hope it's nothing bad!\"\r\n\r\nRedgrave went back to the conning-tower without replying. The only\r\npossible solution of the mystery of the deviation had suddenly dawned\r\nupon him, and a very serious solution it was. He remembered there were\r\nsuch things as dead suns--the derelicts of the Ocean of Space--vast,\r\ninvisible orbs, lightless and lifeless, too distant from any living sun\r\nto be illumined by its rays, and yet exercising the only force left to\r\nthem--the force of attraction. Might not one of these have wandered near\r\nenough to the confines of the Solar System to exert this force, a force\r\nof absolutely unknown magnitude, upon the _Astronef_?\r\n\r\nHe went to the desk beside the instrument-table and plunged into a maze\r\nof mathematics, of masses and weights, angles and distances. Half an\r\nhour later he stood looking at the last symbol on the last sheet of\r\npaper with something like fear. It was the fatal _x_ which remained to\r\nsatisfy the last equation, the unknown quantity which represented the\r\nunseen force that was dragging them into the outer wilderness of\r\ninsterstellar space, into far-off regions from which, with the remaining\r\nforce at his disposal, no return would be possible.\r\n\r\nHe signalled to Murgatroyd to increase the development of the R. Force\r\nfrom a tenth to a fifth. Then he went to the lower saloon, where Zaidie\r\nwas busy with her usual morning tidy-up. Now that the mystery was\r\nexplained there was no reason to keep her in the dark. Indeed, he had\r\ngiven her his word that he would conceal from her no danger, however\r\ngreat, that might threaten them when he had once assured himself of its\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nShe listened to him in silence and without a sign of fear beyond a\r\nlittle lifting of the eyelids and a little fading of the colour in her\r\ncheeks.\r\n\r\n\"And if we can't resist this force,\" she said, when he had finished, \"it\r\nwill drag us millions--perhaps millions of millions--of miles away from\r\nour own system into outer space, and we shall either fall on the surface\r\nof this dead sun and be reduced to a puff of lighted gas in an instant,\r\nor some other body will pull us away from it, and then another away from\r\nthat, and so on, and we shall wander among the stars for ever and ever\r\nuntil the end of time!\"\r\n\r\n\"If the first happens, darling, we shall die--together--without knowing\r\nit. It's the second that I'm most afraid of. The _Astronef_ may go on\r\nwandering among the stars for ever--but we have only water enough for\r\nthree weeks more. Now come into the conning-tower and we'll see how\r\nthings are going.\"\r\n\r\nAs they bent their heads over the instrument-table Redgrave saw that the\r\nremorseless needle had moved two degrees more to the right. The keel of\r\nthe _Astronef_, under the impulse of the R. Force, was continually\r\nturning. The pull of the invisible orb was dragging her slowly but\r\nirresistibly out of her line.\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing for it but this,\" said Redgrave, putting out his hand\r\nto the signal-board, and signalling to Murgatroyd to put the engines to\r\ntheir highest capacity. \"You see, dear, our greatest danger is this: we\r\nhad to exert such a tremendous lot of power getting away from Jupiter\r\nand Saturn, that we haven't any too much to spare, and if we have to\r\nspend it in counteracting the pull of this dead sun, or whatever it is,\r\nwe may not have enough of what I call the R. fluid left to get home\r\nwith.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" she said, staring with wide-open eyes at the needle. \"You mean\r\nthat we may not have enough to keep us from falling into one of the\r\nplanets or perhaps into the Sun itself. Well, supposing the dangers are\r\nequal, this one is the nearest, and so I guess we've got to fight it\r\nfirst.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spoken like a good American!\" he said, putting his arm across her\r\nshoulders and looking at once with infinite pride and infinite regret at\r\nthe calm, proud face which the glory of resignation had adorned with a\r\nnew beauty.\r\n\r\nShe bowed her head and then looked away again so that he should not see\r\nthat there were tears in her eyes. He took his hand from her shoulder\r\nand stared in silence down at the needle. It was stationary again.\r\n\r\n\"We've stopped!\" he said, after a pause of several moments. \"Now, if the\r\nbody that's taken us out of our course is moving away from us we win, if\r\nit's coming towards us we lose. At any rate, we've done all we can. Come\r\nalong, Zaidie, let's go and have a walk on deck.\"\r\n\r\nThey had scarcely reached the upper deck when something happened which\r\ndwarfed all the other experiences of their marvellous voyage into utter\r\ninsignificance.\r\n\r\nAbove and around them the constellations blazed with a splendour\r\ninconceivable to an observer on Earth, but ahead of them gaped the vast,\r\nblack void which sailors call \"the Coal Hole,\" and in which the most\r\npowerful telescopes have only discovered a few faintly luminous bodies.\r\nSuddenly, out of the midst of this infinity of darkness, there blazed a\r\nglare of almost intolerably brilliant radiance. Instantly the forward\r\nend of the _Astronef_ was bathed in light and heat--the light and heat\r\nof a re-created sun, whose elements had been dark and cold for uncounted\r\nages.\r\n\r\nHundreds of tiny points of light, unknown worlds which had been dark for\r\nmyriads of years, twinkled out of the blackness. Then the fierce glare\r\ngrew dimmer. A vast mantle of luminous mist spread out with\r\ninconceivable rapidity, and in the midst of this blazed the central\r\nnucleus--the sun which in far-off ages to come would be the giver of\r\nlight and heat, of life and beauty to worlds unborn, to planets which\r\nwere now only little eddies of atoms whirling in that ocean of nebulous\r\nflame.\r\n\r\nFor more than an hour the two wanderers from the far-off Earth stood\r\nmotionless and silent, gazing on the indescribable splendours of the\r\nfearfully magnificent spectacle before them. Every mundane thought\r\nseemed burnt out of their souls by the glory and the wonder of it. It\r\nwas almost as though they were standing in the very presence of God.\r\nIndeed, were they not witnessing the supreme act of Omnipotence, a new\r\ncreation? Their peril, a peril such as had never threatened mortals\r\nbefore, was utterly forgotten. They had even forgotten each other's\r\npresence. For the time being they existed only to look and to wonder.\r\n\r\nThey were called at length out of their trance by the matter-of-fact\r\nvoice of Murgatroyd saying--\r\n\r\n\"My Lord, she's back to her course. Will I keep the power on full?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh! What's that?\" exclaimed Redgrave, as they both turned quickly\r\nround. \"Oh, it's you, Murgatroyd. The power? Yes, keep it on full till I\r\nhave taken the bearings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, my Lord, very good,\" replied the engineer.\r\n\r\nAs he left the deck Redgrave put his arm round Zaidie and drew her\r\ngently towards him and said, \"Zaidie, truly you are favoured among\r\nwomen! You have seen the beginning of a new creation. You will certainly\r\nbe saved somehow after that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and you too, dear,\" she murmured, as though still half-dreaming.\r\n\"It is very glorious and wonderful; but what is it all--I mean, what is\r\nthe explanation of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The merely scientific explanation, dear, is very simple. I see it all\r\nnow. The force that was dragging us out of our course was the united\r\npull of two dead stars approaching each other in the same orbit. They\r\nmay have been doing that for millions of years. The shock of their\r\nmeeting has transformed their motion into light and heat. They have\r\nunited to form a single sun and a nebula, which will some day condense\r\ninto a system of planets like ours. To-night the astronomers on Earth\r\nwill discover a new star--a variable star as they'll call it--for it\r\nwill grow dimmer as it moves away from our system. It has often happened\r\nbefore.\"\r\n\r\nThen they turned back to the conning-tower.\r\n\r\nThe needle had swung to its old position. The new star, henceforth to be\r\nknown in the annals of astronomy as Lilla-Zaidie, had already set for\r\nthem to the right of the _Astronef_ and risen on the left, and, at a\r\ndistance of more than nine hundred million miles from the Earth, the\r\ncorner was turned, and the homeward voyage began.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\nA week later they crossed the path of Jupiter, but the giant was\r\ninvisible, far away on the other side of the Sun. Redgrave laid his\r\ncourse so as to avail himself to the utmost of the \"pull\" of the planets\r\nwithout going near enough to them to be compelled to exert too much of\r\nthe priceless R. Force, which the indicators showed to be running\r\nperilously low.\r\n\r\nBetween the orbits of Jupiter and Mars they made a most valuable economy\r\nby landing on Ceres, one of the largest of the asteroids, and travelling\r\nabout fifty million miles on her towards the orbit of the Earth without\r\nany expenditure of force whatever. They found that the tiny world\r\npossessed a breathable atmosphere and a fluid resembling water, but\r\nnearly as dense as mercury. A couple of flasks of it form the greatest\r\ntreasures of the British Museum and the National Museum at Washington.\r\nThe vegetable world was represented by coarse grass, lichens, and dwarf\r\nshrubs, and the animal by different species of worms, lizards, flies,\r\nand small burrowing animals of the rodent type.\r\n\r\nAs the orbit of Ceres, like that of the other asteroids, is considerably\r\ninclined to that of the Earth, the _Astronef_ rose from its surface when\r\nthe plane of the Earth's revolution was reached, and the glittering\r\nswarm of miniature planets plunged away into space beneath them.\r\n\r\n\"Where to now?\" said Zaidie, as her husband came down on deck from the\r\nconning-tower.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to try to steer a middle course between the orbits of\r\nMercury and Venus,\" he replied. \"They just happen to be so placed now\r\nthat we ought to be able to get the advantage of the pull of both of\r\nthem as we pass, and that will save us a lot of power. The only thing\r\nI'm afraid of is the pull of the Sun, equal to goodness knows how many\r\ntimes the attraction of all the planets put together. You see, little\r\nwoman, it's like this,\" he went on, taking out a pencil and going down\r\non one knee on the deck: \"Here's the _Astronef_; there's Venus; there's\r\nMercury; there's the Sun; and there, away on the other side of him, is\r\nMother Earth. If we can turn that corner safely and without expending\r\ntoo much power we ought to be all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if we can't, what will happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be a choice between morphine and cremation in the atmosphere of\r\nthe Sun, dear, or rather gradually roasting as we fall towards it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, of course, it will be morphine,\" she said quite quietly, as she\r\nturned away from his diagram and looked at the now fast-increasing disc\r\nof the Sun. A well-balanced mind speedily becomes accustomed even to the\r\nmost terrible perils, and Zaidie had now looked this one so long and so\r\nsteadily in the face that for her it had already become merely the\r\nchoice between two forms of death with just a chance of escape hidden in\r\nthe closed hand of Fate.\r\n\r\nThirty-six Earth-hours later the glorious golden disc of Venus lay broad\r\nand bright beneath them. Above was the blazing orb of the Sun, nearly\r\nhalf as big again as it appears from the Earth, with Mercury, a round\r\nblack spot, travelling slowly across it.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Bird-Folk!\" said Zaidie, looking down at the lovely world below\r\nthem. \"If home wasn't home----\"\r\n\r\n\"We can be back among them in a few hours with absolute safety,\"\r\ninterrupted her husband, catching at the suggestion. \"I've told you the\r\ntruth about the bare possibility of getting back to the Earth. It's only\r\na chance at best, and even if we pass the Sun we may not have force\r\nenough left to prevent the _Astronef_ from being smashed to dust or\r\nburnt up in the atmosphere. After all we might do worse----\"\r\n\r\n\"What would you do if you were alone, Lenox?\" she said, interrupting him\r\nin turn.\r\n\r\n\"I should take my chance and go on. After all home's home and worth a\r\nstruggle. But you, dear----\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm you, and so I take the same chances as you do. Besides, we're not\r\nperfect enough for a world where there isn't any sin. We should probably\r\nget quite miserable there. No, home's home, as you say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then home it is, dear!\" he replied.\r\n\r\nThe resplendent hemisphere of the Love-Star sank swiftly down into the\r\nvault of Space, growing smaller and dimmer as the _Astronef_ sped\r\ntowards the little black spot on the face of the Sun, which to them was\r\nlike a buoy marking a place of utter and hopeless shipwreck in the Ocean\r\nof Immensity.\r\n\r\nThe chronometer, still set to Earth-time, had now begun to mark the last\r\nhours of the _Astronef's_ voyage. She was not only travelling at a speed\r\nof which figures could give no comprehensible idea, but the Sun,\r\nMercury, and the Earth were rushing towards her with a compound\r\nvelocity, composed of the movement of the Solar System through Space and\r\nof the movement of the two planets round the Sun.\r\n\r\nMurgatroyd was at his post in the engine-room. Redgrave and Zaidie had\r\ngone into the conning-tower, perhaps for the last time. For good fortune\r\nor evil, for life or death, they would see the end of the voyage\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\"How far yet, dear?\" she said, as Venus began to slip away behind them,\r\nrising like a splendid moon in their wake.\r\n\r\n\"Only sixty million miles or so, a matter of a few hours, more or\r\nless--it all depends,\" he replied, without taking his eyes off the\r\ncompass.\r\n\r\n\"Sixty millions! Why I feel almost at home again.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we have to turn the corner of the street yet, dear, and after that\r\nthere's a fall of more than twenty-five million miles on to the more or\r\nless kindly breast of Mother Earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"A fall! It does sound rather awful when you put it that way; but I am\r\nnot going to let you frighten me. I believe Mother Earth will receive\r\nher wandering children quite as kindly as they deserve.\"\r\n\r\nThe moon-like disc of Venus grew swiftly smaller, and the black spot on\r\nthe face of the Sun larger and larger as the _Astronef_ rushed silently\r\nand imperceptibly, and yet with almost inconceivable velocity towards\r\ndoom or fortune. Neither Zaidie nor Redgrave spoke again for nearly\r\nthree hours--hours which to them seemed to pass like so many minutes.\r\nTheir eyes were fixed on the black disc of Mercury, which, as they\r\napproached it, expanded with magical rapidity till it completely\r\neclipsed the blazing orb behind it. Their thoughts were far away on the\r\nstill invisible Earth and all the splendid possibilities that it held\r\nfor two young lives like theirs.\r\n\r\nAs the sunlight vanished they looked at each other in the golden\r\nmoonlight of Venus, and Zaidie let her head rest for a moment on her\r\nhusband's shoulder. Then a swiftly broadening gleam of light shot out\r\nfrom behind the black circle of Mercury. The first crisis had come.\r\nRedgrave put out his hand to the signal-board and rang for full power.\r\nThe planet seemed to swing round as the _Astronef_ rushed into the\r\nblaze. In a few minutes it passed through the phases from \"new\" to\r\n\"full.\" Venus became eclipsed in turn as they swung between Mercury and\r\nthe Sun, and then Redgrave, after a rapid glance to either side, said:\r\n\r\n\"If we can only keep the two pulls balanced we shall do it. That will\r\nkeep us in a straight line, and our own momentum ought to carry us into\r\nthe Earth's attraction.\"\r\n\r\nZaidie did not reply. She was shading her eyes with her hand from the\r\nalmost intolerable brilliance of the Sun's rays, and looking straight\r\nahead to catch the first glimpse of the silver-grey orb. Her husband\r\nread her thoughts and respected them. But a few minutes later he\r\nstartled her out of her dream of home by exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\"Good God, we're turning!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you say, dear? Turning what?\"\r\n\r\n\"On our own centre. Look! I'm afraid only a miracle can save us now,\r\ndarling.\"\r\n\r\nShe glanced to the left-hand side where he was pointing. The Sun, no\r\nlonger now a sun, but a vast ocean of flame filling nearly a third of\r\nthe vault of Space, was sinking beneath them. On the right Mercury was\r\nrising. Zaidie knew only too well what this meant. It meant that the\r\nkeel of the _Astronef_ was being dragged out of the straight line which\r\nwould cut the Earth's orbit some forty million miles away. It meant\r\nthat, in spite of the exertion of the full power that the engines could\r\ndevelop, they had begun to fall into the Sun.\r\n\r\nRedgrave laid his hand on hers, and their eyes met. There was no need\r\nfor words. Perhaps speech just then would have been impossible. In that\r\nmute glance each looked into the other's soul and was content. Then he\r\nleft the conning-tower, and Zaidie dropped on to her knees before the\r\ninstrument-table and laid her forehead upon her clasped hands.\r\n\r\nHer husband went to the saloon, unlocked a little cupboard in the wall\r\nand took out a blue bottle of corrugated glass labelled \"Morphine,\r\nPoison.\" He took another empty bottle of white glass and measured fifty\r\ndrops into it. Then he went to the engine-room and said abruptly:\r\n\r\n\"Murgatroyd, I'm afraid it's all up with us. We're falling into the\r\nSun, and you know what that means. In a few hours the _Astronef_ will be\r\nred-hot. So it's roasting alive--or this. I recommend this.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what might that be, my Lord?\" said the old engineer, looking at the\r\nbottle which his master held out towards him.\r\n\r\n\"That's morphine--poison. Fill that up with water, drink it, and in half\r\nan hour you'll be dead without knowing it. Of course, you won't take it\r\nuntil there's absolutely no hope; but, granted that, you'll find this a\r\nbetter death than roasting or baking alive.\" Then his voice changed\r\nsuddenly as he went on, \"Of course, I need not say now, Murgatroyd, how\r\ndeeply I regret now that I asked you to come in the _Astronef_.\"\r\n\r\n\"My Lord, my people have served yours for seven hundred years, and,\r\nwhether on Earth or among the stars, where you go it is my duty to go\r\nalso. But don't ask me to take the poison. It is not for me to say that\r\na journey like this is tempting Providence, but, by my lights, if I am\r\nto die I shall die the death that Providence in its wisdom sends.\"\r\n\r\n\"I daresay you're right in one way, Murgatroyd, but it's no time to\r\nargue about beliefs now. There's the bottle. Do as you think right. And\r\nnow, in case the miracle doesn't happen, goodbye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Goodbye, my Lord, if it is to be,\" replied the old Yorkshireman, taking\r\nthe hand which Redgrave held out to him. \"I'll keep the power on to the\r\nlast, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you may as well. If it doesn't keep us away from the Sun it won't\r\nbe much use to us in two or three hours.\"\r\n\r\nHe left the engine-room and went back to the conning-tower. Zaidie was\r\nstill on her knees. Beneath and around them the awful gulf of flame was\r\nbroadening and deepening. Mercury was rising higher and growing smaller.\r\nHe put the bottle down on the table and waited. Then Zaidie looked up.\r\nHer eyes were clear, and her face was perfectly calm. She rose and put\r\nher arm through his, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Well, is there any hope, dear? There can't be now, can there? Is that\r\nthe morphine?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he replied, slipping his arm beneath hers and round her waist.\r\n\"I'm afraid there's not much chance now, little woman. We're using up\r\nthe last of the power, and you see----\"\r\n\r\nAs he said this he looked at the thermometer. The mercury had risen from\r\n65 degrees Fahrenheit, the normal temperature of the interior of the\r\n_Astronef_, to 93 degrees, and during the half-minute that he watched it\r\nrose another degree. There was no mistaking such a warning as that. He\r\nhad brought two little liqueur glasses in his pocket from the saloon. He\r\ndivided the morphine between them, and filled them up with water.\r\n\r\n\"Not until the last moment, dear,\" said Zaidie, as he set one of them\r\nbefore her. \"We have no right to do it until then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. When the mercury reaches a hundred and fifty. After that it\r\nwill go up ten and fifteen degrees at a jump, and we----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, at a hundred and fifty,\" she replied, cutting short a speech she\r\ndared not hear the end of. \"I understand. It will be impossible to hope\r\nany more.\"\r\n\r\nNow, side by side, they stood and watched the thermometer.\r\n\r\nNinety-five--ninety-eight--a hundred and three--a hundred and\r\nten--eighteen--twenty-four--thirty-two--forty-one.\r\n\r\nThe silent minutes passed, and with each the silver thread--for them the\r\nthread of life--grew, with strange contradiction, longer and longer, and\r\nwith every minute it grew more quickly.\r\n\r\nA hundred and forty-six.\r\n\r\nWith his right arm Redgrave drew Zaidie still closer to him. He put out\r\nhis left hand and took up the little glass. She did the same.\r\n\r\n\"Goodbye, dear, till we have slept and wake again!\"\r\n\r\n\"Goodbye, darling, God grant that we may!\" But the agony of that last\r\nfarewell was more than Zaidie could bear. She looked away at the little\r\nglass in her hand, a hand which even now did not tremble. Then she\r\nraised her eyes again to take one last look at the glory of the stars,\r\nand at the Fate Incarnate in Flame which lay beneath them. Then, even as\r\nthe end of the last minute came, a cry broke through her white,\r\nhalf-parted lips:\r\n\r\n\"The Earth, the Earth--thank God, the Earth!\"\r\n\r\nWith the hand that held the draught of Lethe--which in another moment\r\nshe would have swallowed--she caught at her husband's hand, pulled the\r\nglass out of it, and then with a little sigh she dropped senseless on\r\nthe floor of the conning-tower. Redgrave looked for a moment in the\r\ndirection that her eyes had taken. A pale, silver-grey crescent, with a\r\nlittle white spot near it, was rising out of the blackness beyond the\r\nedge of the solar ocean of flame. Home was in sight at last, but would\r\nthey reach it--and how?\r\n\r\nHe picked her up and carried her to their room and laid her on the bed.\r\nThen he went to the medicine chest again, this time for a very different\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, they were on the upper deck with their telescopes turned\r\non to the rapidly growing crescent of the Home-World, which, in its\r\neternal march through Space, had come into the line of direct attraction\r\njust in time to turn the scale in which the lives of the Space-voyagers\r\nwere trembling. The higher it rose, the bigger and broader and brighter\r\nit grew, and, at last, Zaidie--forgetting in her transport of joy all\r\nthe perils that were yet to come--sprang to her feet and clapped her\r\nhands, and cried:\r\n\r\n\"There's America!\"\r\n\r\nThen she dropped back into her long deck-chair and began a good, hearty,\r\nhealthy cry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is little now to be told that all the world does not already know\r\nas well as it knows the circumstances of Lord and Lady Redgrave's\r\ndeparture from the Earth, at the beginning of that marvellous voyage,\r\nthat desperate plunge into the unknown immensities of Space which began\r\nso happily, and yet with so many grave misgivings in the hearts of their\r\nfriends, and which, after passing many perils, the adventurous voyagers\r\nfinished even more happily than they had begun.\r\n\r\nAs I said at the beginning of this narrative the sole purpose of writing\r\nit has been to place before the reading public an account of the\r\nadventures experienced by Lord Redgrave and his beautiful Countess from\r\nthe time of their departure from the Earth to the hour of their return\r\nto it. Therefore there is no need to re-tell a tale already told, and\r\none that has been read and re-read a thousand times. Every one who has\r\nread his or her newspaper from Chamskatska to Cape Horn, and from Alaska\r\nto South Australia, knows how the Commander of the _Astronef_ so nursed\r\nthe remains which were left to him of the R. Force after overcoming the\r\nattraction of the Sun, that he was able to steer an oblique course\r\nbetween the Moon and the Earth, and to counteract what Zaidie called the\r\nall too-loving attraction of the Mother Planet, and, after sixty hours\r\nof agonising suspense, at last re-entered their native atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe expenditure of the last few units of the R. Force enabled them to\r\njust clear the summits of the Bolivian Andes, to cross the foothills and\r\nwestern slopes of Peru, and finally to let the _Astronef_ drop quietly\r\non to the bosom of the broad Pacific about twenty miles westward of the\r\nPort of Mollendo.\r\n\r\nAll this time thousands of anxious eyes had been peering through\r\ntelescopes every night in quest of the wanderers who must now be\r\nreturning if ever they were to return, and a reward of ten thousand\r\ndollars, offered conjointly by the British and United States Governments\r\nfor the first authentic tidings of the _Astronef_, was won by a smart\r\nyoung Californian, who was Assistant Astronomer at the Harvard\r\nUniversity Observatory at Arequipa.\r\n\r\nOne night when he was on duty watching a lunar occultation, he saw\r\nsomething sweep across the disc of the full moon just as the captain and\r\nofficers of the _St. Louis_ had seen that same something sweep across\r\nthe disc of the rising sun. What else could it be if not the _Astronef_?\r\nHe rang for another assistant to go on with the occultation, and wired\r\ndown to the coast requesting the British Consul at Mollendo to look out\r\nfor an arrival from the skies.\r\n\r\nThree hours later the gleam of an electric searchlight flickered down\r\nover the huge black cone of the Misti, and by dawn the next morning one\r\nof Her Majesty's cruisers--most appropriately named _Astræa_--attached\r\nto the Pacific Squadron then _en route_ from Lima to Valparaiso, steamed\r\nout westward from Mollendo and found the long, shining hull of the\r\n_Astronef_ waiting quietly on the unrippled rollers of the Pacific, and\r\nLord and Lady Redgrave having breakfast in the deck-chamber.\r\n\r\nCompliments and congratulations having been duly exchanged, she was\r\ntaken in tow by the cruiser, and so reached Valparaiso. Here she lay for\r\na few days while the wires of the world were being kept hot with\r\ntelegraphic accounts of her return to Earth, and while her Commander,\r\nwith the assistance of the officers of the National Laboratory, was\r\nreplenishing his stock of the R. Fluid from the chemicals which they had\r\nplaced at his disposal.\r\n\r\nIt would, of course, have been quite possible for him and Zaidie to have\r\ntaken steamer northward to Panama, crossed the Isthmus, and returned to\r\nNew York and Washington _viâ_ Jamaica. The British Admiral even offered\r\nto place his fastest cruiser at their disposal for a run to San\r\nFrancisco, whence the Overland Limited would have landed them in New\r\nYork in four days and a half, but Zaidie vetoed this as quickly as she\r\nhad done the other proposition. If she had her way the _Astronef_ should\r\ngo back to Washington as she had left it, by means of her own motive\r\nforce, and so, of course, it came to pass.\r\n\r\nEven Murgatroyd's grim and homely features seemed irradiated by a glow\r\nof what he afterwards thought unholy pride when he once more stood by\r\nhis levers and heard the familiar signal coming from the conning-tower.\r\n\r\n\"A tenth.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then--\"Stand by steering-gear.\"\r\n\r\nThe next moment there was another tinkle in the engine-room.\r\n\r\nRedgrave, standing with Zaidie in the conning-tower, moved the\r\npower-wheel through ten degrees, and then to the amazement of tens of\r\nthousands of spectators, the hull of the _Astronef_ rose perpendicularly\r\nfrom the waters of the Bay. The British Squadron and a detachment of the\r\nChilian fleet thundered out a salute which was answered a few moments\r\nlater by the shore batteries, Redgrave went down into the deck-chamber\r\nand fired twenty-one shots from one of the Maxim-Nordenfelts--the same\r\nwith which he had mown down the crowds of Martians in the square of\r\ntheir great city a hundred and thirty million miles away, and while he\r\nwas doing this Zaidie in the conning-tower ran the White Ensign up to\r\nthe top of the flagstaff.\r\n\r\nThen the glass doors were closed again, the propellers began to revolve\r\nat their utmost speed, and the Space-Navigator with one tremendous leap\r\ncleared the double chain of the Andes and vanished to the\r\nnorth-eastward.\r\n\r\nTo describe the reception of Lord and Lady Redgrave when the _Astronef_\r\ndropped a few hours later, on to the very spot in front of the steps of\r\nthe Capitol at Washington from which she had risen just four months\r\nbefore, would only be to repeat what has already been told in the Press\r\nof the world, and especially of the United States, with a far more\r\nluxuriant wealth of detail than could possibly be emulated here. Suffice\r\nit to say that the first human form that Zaidie embraced after her long\r\nwanderings was that of Mrs. Van Stuyler, whom the President of the\r\nUnited States had escorted to the gangway.\r\n\r\nThe most marvellous of human adventures become commonplace by\r\nrepetition, and Mrs. Van Stuyler had already spent nearly a fortnight\r\ndevouring every item, whether of fact or fancy, with which the American\r\nPress had embroidered the adventures of the _Astronef_ and her crew. And\r\nso when the first embracings and emotions were over, all she could find\r\nto say was:\r\n\r\n\"Well, Zaidie dear, and how did you enjoy it, after all?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was just gorgeous, Mrs. Van, and if there was a more gorgeous word\r\nthan that in the American language I'd use it,\" replied Zaidie, with\r\nanother hug, \"Why didn't you come? You'd have been--well no, perhaps I'd\r\nbetter not say what you would have been. But just think of it, or try\r\nto--A honeymoon trip of over two thousand million miles, and\r\nback--safe--thank God!\"\r\n\r\nAs she said this, Zaidie threw her arm over Mrs. Van Stuyler's shoulder,\r\nand drew her away towards the forward end of the deck-chamber. At the\r\nsame moment the President's hand met Lord Redgrave's in a long, strong\r\ngrip. They didn't say anything just then. Men seldom do under such\r\ncircumstances.",
