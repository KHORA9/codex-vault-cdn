Encircle the globe in your library with a rubber band,\r\nso that it cuts across South America from about Porto Alegre to Lima\r\non one side, and through southern Siam and the northernmost of the\r\nPhilippine Islands on the other, and you make hemispheres, the northern\r\nof which (with London at its center) contains almost all the land of\r\nthe globe, while the southern (with New Zealand as its central point)\r\nis almost entirely water, Australia, and the narrow southern half of\r\nSouth America being the only lands of consequence in its whole area.\r\nObserving the map in this way, noticing that, besides nearly a complete\r\nhalf-world of water south of your rubber equator, much of the northern\r\nhemisphere also is afloat, you are willing to believe the assertion\r\nthat there is almost three times as much of the outside of the earth\r\nhidden under the waves as appears above them. The estimate in round\r\nnumbers is one hundred and fifty million square (statute) miles of\r\nocean surface, as compared with about fifty million square miles of\r\nland on the globe.\r\n\r\nTo the people whose speculations in geography are the oldest that have\r\ncome down to us, the earth seemed to be an island around which was\r\nperpetually flowing a river with no further shore visible. Beyond it,\r\nthey thought, lay the abodes of the dead. This river, as the source\r\nof all other rivers and waters, was deified by the early Greeks and\r\nplaced among their highest gods as Oceanus, whence our word “ocean.”\r\nAccompanying, or belonging to him, there grew up, in the fertile\r\nimagination of that poetic people, a large company of gods and\r\ngoddesses, while men hid their absence of real knowledge by peopling\r\nthe deep with quaint monsters.\r\n\r\n“The word for ‘ocean’ (_mare_) in the Latin tongue means, by\r\nderivation, a desert, and the Greeks spoke of it as ‘the barren brine.’”\r\n\r\nOver these old fables we need not linger. All the myths and guesswork\r\nthat went before history represented the sea as older than the land,\r\nand told how creation began by lifting the earth above the universal\r\nwaste of waters. The story in Genesis is only one of many such stories.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A QUIET SEA, AND THE SUN AT MIDNIGHT.\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph.]\r\n\r\nScientific men believe that when our planet first went circling swiftly\r\nin its orbit it was a glowing, globular mass of fiery vapors; but\r\nas time passed, the icy chill of space slowly cooled these vapors,\r\nand chemical changes steadily modified, sorted, and solidified the\r\nmaterials into the beginnings of the present form and character, until\r\nat last _water_ came into existence. This must have been at first in\r\nthe form of a thick envelop of heated vapors, impregnated with gases,\r\nthat inwrapped the globe in a darkness lit only by its own fires.\r\n\r\nAfter that, when further changes had come about,—let us picture\r\nit,—what deluges of rain were poured out of and down through those\r\nmurky clouds where thunders bellowed and lightnings warred! At first\r\nall the rains that fell must have been turned to steam again; but by\r\nand by the steady downpour cooled the shaping globe so that all the\r\nwater was not vaporized, but some stayed as a liquid where it fell,\r\nand this increased in amount more and more, until finally, between the\r\nhissing core of the half-hardened planet and the dense clouds which\r\nkept out all the sunlight, there rolled the heated waves of the first\r\nocean—an ocean broken only by the earliest ridges, like chains of\r\nislands, marking the skeletons of the continents that were to follow—an\r\nocean sending up ceaseless volumes of steam to form new clouds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EATING AWAY THE COAST.]\r\n\r\nYet all the while the cooling of the planet went on. Now, when any\r\nheated substance cools it contracts, and the globe as a whole is\r\nno exception to the rule; but a sphere formed of so incompressible\r\na substance as rock can shrink only by some sort of folding or\r\ndisplacement of its surface. Therefore, as the cooling of our globe\r\nproceeded, explosions and swellings constantly occurred at weak points\r\nor lines on or near the surface, where the prodigious strain forced a\r\nbreak. That these upheavals were most prominent and extended in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere is shown by the fact that the great masses and\r\nheights of land are grouped there; and the trend of mountain-ranges\r\nseems to show that the range of breakage and upheaval was in general\r\nin north-and-south lines. Elsewhere, and mainly in the southern\r\nhemisphere, broad areas of perhaps stiffer crust sank downward, making\r\nthe vast depressions into which poured the waters of the primeval sea,\r\nand where our oceans still sway and roll.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SURF AT FORT DUMPLING, R. I.]\r\n\r\nAll these changes, however, have been in the direction of insuring\r\nmore and more stability; and when the ocean water had thoroughly\r\ncooled, the very chill of its vast masses in the depths of the troughs\r\nassisted in the work, for the cold water, by more rapidly withdrawing\r\ntheir heat, caused the rocks beneath their basins to become denser,\r\nthicker, stronger, and consequently less liable to break or change,\r\nthan were those rocks forming the foundations of the continents.\r\n\r\nThe moment it had shores to beat upon, that moment the ocean began\r\nto knock them to pieces under its pounding surf, and to grind the\r\nfragments so small that they could be drifted away, reassorted, and\r\ndeposited wherever the water was sufficiently quiet to let them fall.\r\nThe original rocks—chiefly granite—held the different forms of lime,\r\nmagnesia, etc., to make the limestones; the silica to make the gritty\r\nsandstones; the alumina to make the clays; and so on. The sea not only\r\nwas the agent to eat this old, rich crust to pieces and respread it\r\ninto strata, but to sort out for us the materials to a considerable\r\nextent, laying down beds of limestone by themselves, and sandstone,\r\nshales, marl, etc., by themselves. It is probable, says Professor\r\nShaler, that layers of rock twenty miles in thickness have thus been\r\nlaid down on the gradually settling ocean floor, much of which has been\r\nraised again to form continental lands.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have spoken of the waters that surround the continents as\r\nif they formed one mass, as, practically, they do; but for convenience\r\nsake we may designate certain areas by separate names, which ought\r\nnow to be defined. Thus the larger, more open spaces are known as\r\n_oceans_, and of these five are recognized, namely, Pacific, Atlantic,\r\nIndian, Arctic, and Antarctic. Parts or branches of these, more or less\r\ninclosed by land and usually comparatively shallow, are termed _seas_.\r\n\r\n_The Pacific Ocean_ is the largest, it alone covering more space than\r\nall the continents combined, having a breadth, east and west, of ten\r\nthousand miles (about the length of the Atlantic), and an area of\r\nseventy million square miles. The equator divides it into the North\r\nand South Pacific. The former is comparatively free from islands,\r\nand is inclosed northward by the approaching extremities of Alaska\r\nand Siberia; while the latter widens at the south into the boundless\r\nAntarctic Ocean. Its basin is a vast depression of fairly uniform\r\ndepth, studded in the western part by island peaks,—the summits of\r\nsubmerged volcanic mountain-ranges. The name “Pacific,” or “Peaceful,”\r\nwas given to it by Magalhaens (Magellan), its first navigator, in 1540\r\n(see Chapter IV), in his joy at having escaped from the tempestuous\r\nexperience he had long endured in the South Atlantic. On the whole the\r\nPacific deserves its name as compared with the Atlantic—a fact chiefly\r\ndue to its great size. The term “South Sea” was formerly much used for\r\nit, but English-speaking persons now usually mean by that phrase the\r\nisland-studded district between Hawaii and Australia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PERCÉ ROCK, IN THE GULF OF ST. LAWRENCE, SHOWING\r\nDESTRUCTION OF SHORE-ROCKS BY WATER.]\r\n\r\n_The Atlantic_ commemorates in its name the myth of Atlas and his\r\nisland. Atlas seems to have been originally, among the Greeks, the\r\nname of the Peak of Tenerife, of which they had vague information from\r\nthe earlier Phenician sea-wanderers. Then this was forgotten, and in\r\nplace of the fact arose a myth of a Titan who stood upon a vast island\r\nin or beyond the “Western Sea,” called Atlantis. Legends of wars with\r\nits people form a part of the nebulous hero-story of the beginnings of\r\nAthens; and it is said to have sunk out of sight long before records\r\nbegan. There have always been those who believed this story founded\r\nupon fact, and only a few years ago a book was printed in the United\r\nStates arguing that the tale was the history of a real land; but not\r\nonly is there no literary or historical evidence that Atlantis had\r\nany firmer foundation than vague memories of the Cape Verd or Canary\r\nIslands, but every evidence of the geological condition and history\r\nof the eastern shores and bed of the middle Atlantic Ocean shows that\r\nno such convulsion as the destruction of this island calls for ever\r\ntook place there, or that there was ever such a land to be submerged.\r\nThe Atlantic occupies a long, winding, comparatively narrow trough,\r\nthat measures about ten thousand miles north and south, from the ice\r\nof the Antarctic to the ice of the Arctic ocean, and has only a few\r\nislets south of Iceland, the Faroes and the Shetlands, which rise from\r\na plateau stretching from Labrador to Great Britain, the higher points\r\nof which were probably above the water within comparatively recent\r\ngeological times, possibly since man appeared upon the globe. The\r\naverage depth of the Atlantic south of this ridge is about thirteen\r\nthousand feet, but greater depths are found along the African and\r\nAmerican coasts, on each side of a long submerged ridge from which rise\r\nthe isolated islands of Cape Verd, St. Helena, and Tristan da Cunha.\r\nThe width from Norway to Greenland is only about eight hundred miles,\r\nbut between Montevideo and Cape Town it is thirty-six hundred miles,\r\nand the average width is about three thousand miles. The shape and\r\nsituation of the Atlantic make it the most stormy of the three great\r\noceans, and it is the one where the phenomena of tides, currents, etc.,\r\nare most prominently manifested, as we shall see. It is also the most\r\nfrequented and best known, because it has been necessary to study it\r\nfor the benefit of commerce.\r\n\r\n_The Indian Ocean_ is simply the extension of the vast southern\r\nwater-zone northward of parallel 40°, south latitude, where, from the\r\nCape of Good Hope to Tasmania, it is six thousand miles in width.\r\nAt this line the depth suddenly decreases, as though the edge of a\r\nsubmerged Antarctic plateau defined the southerly rim of its basin\r\nthere. This ocean contains several large and some groups of small\r\nislands, but these are mostly near the shore, and connected with the\r\nneighboring continent by shallow waters, showing that they rise from\r\na submerged plateau. The average depth of the Indian Ocean is about\r\nfourteen thousand feet; its surface-water is warmer and salter than\r\nthat of any other; and its winds and weather are more regular and\r\npeaceful than in either the Atlantic or the North Pacific.\r\n\r\n_The Arctic Ocean_ is the well-defined body of water around and\r\nprobably over the north pole. It is connected with the Pacific only\r\nby the narrow and very shallow Bering Strait, and with the Atlantic\r\nby comparatively narrow openings. It has been fairly well explored as\r\nfar north as the parallel of 80°, and found to contain many islands;\r\nbut it appears that there is great depth of water north of Spitzbergen\r\nand northeast of Greenland, making it probable that the trough of the\r\nAtlantic reaches to or beyond the pole itself. Most of its area is\r\ncovered with drifting ice.\r\n\r\n_The Antarctic Ocean_ is regarded as the space of water within the\r\nAntarctic circle; but this is surrounded by a zone of deep ocean,\r\nunbroken almost half-way to the equator, except by the narrow southern\r\npart of South America and by New Zealand. It is an area, apparently\r\nrather shallow, of ice, fogs, and tempestuous gales, inclosing lands of\r\nunknown extent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WAVE-WORN CLIFFS AND PEBBLE-BEACH AT ETRETAT, FRANCE.\r\n\r\n(FROM A PAINTING BY WILLIAM P. W. DANA.)]\r\n\r\nBut these geographical distinctions are merely convenient methods of\r\nspeech. After all, there is only one ocean “poured round all,” and its\r\nparticles are incessantly changed in place and remingled by means of\r\na world-wide system of tides and currents, the effect of which is to\r\nkeep sea-water everywhere uniform in character and perfectly pure and\r\nhealthful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN MID-OCEAN: A GREAT WAVE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nWAVES, TIDES, AND CURRENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that we have studied the ancient ocean, it is time to study its\r\npresent characteristics and understand the great and important part it\r\nplays in the world.\r\n\r\nA very striking thing about the ocean is its flatness. Being water,\r\nit seeks always to find its level; and we commonly assume that it\r\neverywhere does so, and take the sea-level as the standard from which\r\nto calculate all heights above or depths below its surface; that is,\r\nwe assume that every part of the surface of the ocean when calm and at\r\nmean tide is exactly the same distance from the center of the globe.\r\nThis, however, is not wholly true. Careful observation has shown that\r\nthe Pacific is several feet lower on the western shore of the Isthmus\r\nof Darien than is the Atlantic on its eastern shore—a fact due, no\r\ndoubt, to the crowding of water by the Gulf Stream into the Caribbean\r\nSea. The Mediterranean is known to be somewhat higher than the\r\nAtlantic, and other differences exist in similar places elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThis introduces the subject of depth—a matter which we have learned\r\naccurately only within a very few years. In the early days ropes alone\r\nwere used for sounding, and these had to be of considerable size to\r\nbear the strain; but a mile or so of rope became too heavy to handle,\r\nand depths below that length remained unmeasured. Then a little machine\r\nwas tried consisting of a heavy weight having attached to it, by a\r\ntrigger, a wooden float. This was thrown overboard. It sank, and when\r\nit touched bottom the shock released the float. From the time that\r\nelapsed before the float reappeared the depth was estimated. This,\r\nhowever, was little better than guesswork; and accurate soundings\r\nexceeding one thousand fathoms were not obtained until an American\r\nnaval officer began to use wire instead of rope. From this hint\r\nwas developed elaborate machinery, operated by steam, using steel\r\npiano-wire, having automatic registers of the amount reeled out, and\r\ncarried down by weights that were released when the bottom was struck,\r\nmaking it easier to recover the wire. To these weights (or rather to\r\nthe wire just above them) were attached devices for clutching and\r\nbringing to the surface specimens of the bottom, self-closing jars to\r\nfetch water from the lowest layer, self-registering thermometers that\r\nrecorded the temperatures at the greatest or at various intermediate\r\ndepths, and other means of learning the character of the water,\r\nbottom-material, and animal life several miles below the surface,\r\nincluding methods of photographing by aid of a submerged electric\r\nlight. Such investigations, carried on in ships suitably equipped, have\r\nbeen prosecuted by several governments, most notably by the expedition\r\nof the _Challenger_, a British surveying-ship which circumnavigated the\r\nglobe during the years from 1872 to 1876.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEA-CAVE NEAR GIANT’S CAUSEWAY, NORTH OF IRELAND.]\r\n\r\nThis and many other expeditions have sounded in all parts of the world,\r\nand explored large tracts where the water uniformly exceeded three\r\nmiles in depth. The United States ship _Enterprise_, after passing the\r\nChatham Islands in her run from New Zealand to the Strait of Magellan,\r\nfound the water everywhere more than thirteen thousand feet deep.\r\nThroughout her run from Montevideo to New York the water varied from\r\ntwelve to eighteen thousand feet deep, and Captain Nares and Admiral\r\nBelknap found like depths over equally vast breadths elsewhere.\r\n\r\nYet even in these basins more profound pits and valleys exist. Several\r\nplaces are known near Japan and off Porto Rico exceeding five miles\r\nin depth; and an English officer sounded 29,400 feet in the southern\r\nPacific Ocean, nineteen hundred miles east of Brisbane, without finding\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nThe average depth of all the oceans is estimated at from twelve\r\nthousand to fifteen thousand feet. As, according to Humboldt, the\r\naverage height of the lands of the globe is only about one thousand\r\nfeet, it will be seen that all the land now above the water, and its\r\nfoundations, could be shoveled into the ocean troughs and still leave\r\nwater more than two miles in depth covering the whole planet.\r\n\r\nThe soundings and dredgings of which I have spoken enable us to make\r\na tolerable map of the ocean beds and to describe their features.\r\nAll the continents are bordered by a shelf reaching out under the\r\nshallow shore-water to a greater or less distance, and then dropping,\r\nusually with much abruptness, to the ocean trough. This shelf, perhaps\r\noriginally a part of the primeval continent, bears most of the great\r\nislands near continents, such as Newfoundland, the West Indies, Great\r\nBritain and Ireland, Madagascar, the Aleutian, Japanese, and Philippine\r\ngroups, the Malay Archipelago, and others. If you will look at a map\r\nthat has marked upon it the line of one thousand fathoms’ depth along\r\nthe shores of the various continents, you will find it reaching far\r\nout from the eastern shores of both Americas, the western and northern\r\nshores of Europe, the eastern shores of South Africa, prolonging India\r\nhundreds of miles, and embracing great spaces among the East Indies,\r\nwhile even the hundred-fathom line would connect many an island with\r\nthe mainland or with some other island, as they actually have been\r\nconnected in times gone by. The fact is, there is not a single proper\r\nmountain-peak rising out of deep water at any great distance from the\r\nmargins of the continents. All the numerous islands of the wide oceans\r\nare either coral reefs or the summits of volcanic cones.\r\n\r\nUpon this shelf, and for the most part within two hundred miles of the\r\ncoast, are deposited all of the materials torn from the land by the sea\r\nor brought down by rivers or glaciers, excepting the very finest, which\r\ncurrents may float somewhat farther out, and also excepting the rocks\r\nthat icebergs carry away and drop in mid-ocean; but this is not a great\r\namount, for most icebergs strand on the shallows off Newfoundland or in\r\nBering Sea.\r\n\r\nAlmost nothing from the shores, therefore, reaches the central depths\r\nof the open oceans, whose beds are in substantially the same condition\r\nthat they were in at the beginning, except for two things—volcanic\r\nupheavals in some places, and the remains of animal life everywhere.\r\nThe former exception is a very important one, since it is now known,\r\naccording to Professor Shaler, that volcanoes, by their eruptions, send\r\nmore dust and broken materials to the seas than the rivers and shores\r\ncombined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VOLCANO KRAKATOA (SUNDA STRAIT) IN ERUPTION IN 1883.]\r\n\r\n“Although the deeper sea-floors probably lack mountains,” says\r\nProfessor Shaler, “they are not without striking reliefs, which,\r\nif they could be seen, would present all the dignity which their\r\nsize gives to the Himalayas or Andes: the difference is that these\r\nelevations are not true mountains, but volcanic peaks, sometimes\r\nisolated, again accumulated in long, narrow ridges, but all made up of\r\nmatter poured out from the craters or through great fissures in the\r\ncrust. So numerous are these heaped masses of lava and other ejections\r\nfrom these vents that there is hardly any considerable area of the\r\noceans where they do not rise above the surface. There are indeed\r\nthousands of these volcanic peaks distributed from pole to pole....\r\nThus on the floor of the North Atlantic there is evidently a long,\r\nirregular chain of these elevations extending from the Icelandic group\r\nof islands southward to the Azores. If an explorer could view this part\r\nof the sea-bottom, he would probably find that the line of craters was\r\nas continuous as that exhibited by the volcanoes of the Andes.\r\n\r\n“Besides the volcanic peaks,” Professor Shaler continues, “the\r\nsea-bottom in certain parts of the tropics ... is beset with the\r\nsingular elevations formed by coral reefs.” But of these I shall have\r\nmore to say toward the end of the book, and I allude to them here only\r\nas a feature of the invisible landscape beneath the waves.\r\n\r\nOver the vast, gently undulating spaces separating these submerged\r\nlines of volcanoes and the ridges of coral, lies a mat of mud of\r\nunknown thickness, which naturalists term “ooze.” It is principally\r\ncomposed of volcanic dust and of the microscopic “tests,” or flinty\r\nlimy skeletons of minute animals, few of which are large enough to be\r\nseen by the unaided eye. “Dwelling in myriads in the superficial parts\r\nof the sea, these foraminifera, as they are termed, sink at death to\r\nthe bottom, over which they accumulate a thick coating of minutely\r\ndivided limestone powder, forming a layer of ooze as unsubstantial as\r\nthe finest snow.”\r\n\r\nIn regions like the North Atlantic this ooze consists almost wholly of\r\nsuch animal matter; but in other regions, such as the South Pacific,\r\nwhere volcanoes prevail, it is constantly and largely increased by an\r\nenormous quantity of mineral matter hurled broadcast by volcanoes,\r\nall of which are on islands or near sea-coasts. A part of this is the\r\nmerest dust, which slowly settles from the air, perhaps hundreds of\r\nmiles from where it was ejected. A larger part consists of that spongy\r\nlava called pumice, which is so full of holes filled with air and\r\ngases that it may float half way around the globe before it sinks, as\r\nhappened after the explosion of Krakatoa.\r\n\r\nInto the oceanic ooze, too, sinks so much of all dead fishes and other\r\nmid-sea animals as is not dissolved or devoured before reaching it; and\r\nit forms the grave of thousands of men. It is often said that ships\r\nand other things would not sink far, but would float, suspended by\r\ndense water or some miraculous influence, only a few hundred or a few\r\nthousand feet below the surface, for no one knows how long. But this\r\neerie notion has no foundation in fact. “No other fate,” we are assured\r\nby those who know, “awaits the drowned sailor or his ship than that\r\nwhich comes to the marine creatures who die on the bottom of the sea.\r\nIn time their dust all passes into the great storehouse of the earth,\r\neven as those who receive burial on land.” Wooden wrecks probably last\r\nmuch longer than those of iron.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned that a small part of what the sea tears away from the\r\nland, or receives from rivers, winds, and other sources, is dissolved\r\nin its waters, which now contain, no doubt, samples of every ingredient\r\nof the rocks and soils of the dry land, and very likely some elements\r\nnot yet detected. This solvent power of the sea explains its saltness,\r\nand it must go on growing more and more bitter as long as its waves\r\ngrind at the shores and the rivers run down. The salinity varies in\r\ndegree, water at great depths being salter than that near the surface,\r\nand excelling in saltness where evaporation is rapid, as under the\r\ntrade-winds, while fresher in the regions of equatorial calms, where an\r\nimmense amount of rain falls; broadly, the lightest (freshest) water\r\nis found at the equator, and the heaviest in the temperate regions.\r\nInclosed, or nearly inclosed, areas become very salt. Thus the Dead Sea\r\nis what chemists call a saturated solution, being nearly one third (28\r\nper cent.) salt, and Great Salt Lake in Utah is not far behind. The Red\r\nSea contains 4 per cent., and some parts of the Mediterranean nearly as\r\nmuch. Taking all the open oceans together, about 3½ in every 100 parts\r\n(3½ per cent.) is composed of various salts, more than three quarters\r\nof which is common salt (chloride of sodium), and the remainder mainly\r\nforms of magnesium. One of the _Challenger_ authors has estimated that\r\nthe oceans contain enough salt to make a layer 170 feet thick over\r\ntheir whole area, and another writer says that the amount, if heaped\r\nup, would be four times larger than the whole bulk of Europe above the\r\nlevel of high-water mark, mountains and all.\r\n\r\nIn early times, indeed, sea-water, which yields about a quarter of\r\na pound of crystallized salt per gallon, was almost the only source\r\nof salt for food. Even yet it is the principal source of supply for\r\nthe manufacture of commercial salt in France, Portugal, Spain, Italy,\r\nAustria, the West Indies, and Central and South America; and it is\r\nlargely used in Holland, Belgium, and Great Britain. The early process,\r\nstill extensively practised in some parts of Europe, was to admit\r\nthe sea-water to large partitioned flats floored with clay, where it\r\nevaporated rapidly. The salt-crystals remaining were then collected,\r\npurified to a greater or less degree, and sold off-hand. It was by\r\nsimilar means that our great-grandfathers in New England and along the\r\nSouthern coasts provided themselves with salt, only they used large\r\nvats arranged over fires instead of earthen basins exposed to the sun.\r\n\r\nBut analysis of sea-water discloses small quantities of many other\r\nrecognizable minerals. Silica must be there to supply the needs of many\r\nforaminifers, sponges, and other animals; lime in various forms exists,\r\nor else such sea animals as mollusks could not compose their shells,\r\nnor polyps erect their enormous reefs; bromine is present, and to the\r\niodine and other mineral dyes in the water we owe the lovely purples,\r\ncrimsons, and scarlets painting corallines, seaweeds, echinoderms, and\r\nsome molluscan shells, as that of the Sargasso-snail (Janthina).\r\n\r\nAs for gold and silver, both are present. I have seen it stated that a\r\nvoyage of a year or two is sufficient to permit the formation of a film\r\nof silver all over the copper sheathing of a ship’s bottom, so that\r\na frigate returning from a long cruise is really silver-plated; but I\r\nfancy this is more a matter of imagination than visible reality. Gold,\r\nin certain chemical combinations, certainly exists in sea-water, and\r\nmay be extracted therefrom. Up to the present, however, the cost of the\r\nextraction has been more than the precious metal obtained was worth.\r\nGold is often washed from sea-sand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FIORD, OR DEEP CREVICE WORN IN SEA-CLIFFS.]\r\n\r\nThe ceaseless restlessness of the ocean forms another of the greatest\r\ncontrasts between it and the immovable land—_terra firma_, as those\r\nlike to call it who have been tossing too long on the “rolling deep”.\r\nThis characteristic restlessness involves some of the most important\r\nand interesting facts in physical geography; for were the waters\r\nstill,—that is, were the oceans simply huge, quiet ponds,—none of that\r\naction could take place along the shores which has been so important\r\nan agent in shaping the world and making it a suitable place for human\r\nhabitation and social development.\r\n\r\nOn a planet with an atmosphere and changing seasons like ours, however,\r\na stagnant ocean is as impossible as a motionless air; indeed, it is\r\nbecause the air _is_ always in motion that large bodies of water are\r\nnever at rest, for it is the changing density and temperature and\r\nmovements (winds) of the air that produce waves and currents.\r\n\r\nWaves are caused by the pressure and friction of the wind upon the\r\nsurface of the water, as you may readily see at any pond; and the water\r\nin them simply rises and falls, driving forward a little at the very\r\nsurface so as to cause a gentle current called _wind-drift_. When the\r\nwaves approach the shallow, sloping border of the land they are checked\r\nat the bottom by the slope of the beach, while the freer upper part\r\ngoes forward, and the waves speedily lose their rounded form and become\r\nmore and more sharply ridged and steep on the front side as they sweep\r\non until at last they pitch forward in the crash and thunder of surf.\r\n\r\nIn the open ocean the waves are usually doing little work except to\r\ncause the surface to rise and fall. The harder the wind blows, the\r\nhigher the waves become, and the faster they travel. This speed has\r\nbeen calculated, and has been found to be proportionate to size.\r\n\r\n“Waves 200 feet long from hollow to hollow,” we are told, “travel about\r\n19 knots per hour; those of 400 feet in length make 27 knots; and\r\nthose of 600 feet rush forward irresistibly at 32 knots.” These, of\r\ncourse, are under the furious impulse of a gale, and it is marvelous\r\nthat ships can be made to ride over them; nor is it any wonder that\r\nexcited mariners clinging to the bulwarks of some small and heeling\r\ncraft, should call them “mountain high,” and declare in all seriousness\r\nthat they have seen their crests rising one hundred feet above their\r\nhollows. No such altitude, nor half of it, probably, is ever reached\r\nby a storm-wave in the heaviest cyclone. An excellent authority,\r\nLieutenant Qualtrough, assures us that the highest trustworthy\r\nmeasurements are from forty-four to forty-eight feet. The height of a\r\nwave depends upon what mariners call its “fetch”—that is, its distance\r\nfrom the place where the waves began to form. This has been worked\r\nout mathematically by Thomas Stevenson (father of the late Robert\r\nLouis Stevenson, the novelist), an eminent engineer and designer of\r\nlighthouses, who gives the following formula: “The height of the wave\r\nin feet is equal to 1½ multiplied by the square root of the fetch in\r\nnautical miles.” If the waves began 100 miles away from your ship, the\r\nwaves about you will be 15 feet high, because the square root of 100\r\nis 10, and one and a half times 10 is 15 (feet). The highest waves are\r\nnot formed in the greatest tempests, which beat down their crests, but\r\nwhen the gale is both very strong and long continued. The worst “seas,”\r\nas sailors call big waves, are those met with off the Cape of Good Hope\r\nand Cape Horn.\r\n\r\nThe depth to which wave disturbance extends depends on the violence of\r\nthe wind, and near shore upon the slope of the bottom. Prestwich tells\r\nus that pebbles may sometimes be moved at the depth of one hundred\r\nfeet, and sand much deeper, as is shown by the fact that the bottom is\r\ndisturbed in heavy storms on the Banks of Newfoundland.\r\n\r\nThe weight and power of such on-rushing masses of water are tremendous,\r\nas appears from the effect on coasts where they strike; but this\r\nopens up a subject which is too large for treatment here, and I must\r\nrefer readers to geological treatises, and to such special works as\r\nProfessor N. S. Shaler’s excellent “Sea and Land,” where the work of\r\nthe ocean in tearing down and building up its coasts is fully and\r\nentertainingly explained. I shall have something more to say on\r\nthis point, also, when I come to the chapter “Dangers of the Deep,”\r\nand speak of the terrible destruction caused by earthquakes, and in\r\ncertain other agitations of the sea not due to the wind, and often\r\nstyled “tidal waves.” There is only one kind of “tidal wave,” properly\r\nspeaking, however; and this is a theoretical rather than an actual one,\r\nperceptible usually only in that rising and falling of the water along\r\ncoasts twice each twenty-four hours that we call the flow and ebb of\r\nthe tides; and here we see the effect rather than the thing itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOW TIDE, ST. JOHN’S HARBOR, N. B.]\r\n\r\nThe tide has been an inevitable circumstance of the existence on the\r\nearth of the ocean, or any other great body of water, ever since its\r\norigin, yet it was not until Sir Isaac Newton made us comprehend\r\nthe law of gravitation that its mystery was explained. We now know\r\nwith certainty—if you want the mathematical formulæ and so forth,\r\nconsult some good modern encyclopædia under the word _tide_—that this\r\nperiodical rising and falling of the sea is due to the attraction of\r\nthe sun and moon,—to the last three times as much as to the first,\r\nbecause it is so much nearer. This attraction is exerted toward the\r\nglobe as a whole; and its visible effect upon the movable water is to\r\nlift it bodily on that side nearest the moon, and at the same time to\r\npull away the earth from the water on the opposite side, which amounts\r\nto the same thing; and thus high tides are simultaneously produced\r\nat these antipodes, which accounts for the two a day. At the same\r\ntime, however, the intermediate spaces have low tides caused by an\r\nattraction there toward the center of the earth. “There are thus always\r\nsimultaneously and directly under the moon two high waters opposite\r\neach other, and two low waters at equal distances between them. Owing\r\nto the rotation of the earth, this permanent system of swells and\r\ntroughs travels from east to west over every part of the ocean and of\r\nits coast, and explains the regular succession of rising and falling\r\nwaters, at equal intervals of time, which we call the tides.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EARTHQUAKE WAVE PASSING OVER THE LIGHTHOUSE ON POINT\r\nANJER.]\r\n\r\nBut the sun also exerts a similar but lesser influence, producing\r\nfour daily solar tides, which most of the time are lost to view in\r\nthe greater lunar tides. When, however, the moon gets into line with\r\nthe earth and the sun, so that both the heavenly bodies pull together\r\nlike a tandem team, as happens twice a month,—at new moon and full\r\nmoon,—their combined action causes unusually high water, which is the\r\nsum of the lunar and solar tides, and is called the spring tide. High\r\nwater is then highest, and low water lowest. On the other hand, in the\r\nmidst of these fortnightly intervals, when the moon is at its first\r\nor third quarter, the sun is a full quarter of the heavens (90°) away\r\nfrom the moon. Its influence, therefore, acts at right angles to or\r\npractically against that of the moon, and the solar tides go to swell\r\nthe low waters and diminish the high waters, forming what sailors call\r\nneap tides,—preserving an old English word meaning _low_.\r\n\r\nNow remember that the globe is not standing still, even while we make\r\nthese explanations, but is revolving at a tremendous speed, so that the\r\nwater under the moon lifted by lunar attraction is changing place every\r\ninstant at the rate of over one thousand miles an hour, and you have\r\nthe conception of a low wave on each side of the earth, reaching north\r\nand south, highest and swiftest on the equator and diminishing toward\r\nthe poles. These are the true tidal waves. Were the globe covered with\r\nan unbroken mantle of water, such waves, each about twenty inches (or\r\ntwenty-nine inches at springtide) high on the average at the equator,\r\nwould follow one another round and round the earth at the rate of one\r\ncomplete circuit in every twenty-four hours. That must have been the\r\ncase in the primeval ocean before any continents existed; and something\r\nof it still exists in the belt of unobstructed water surrounding the\r\nAntarctic continent of ice. It would then be flood tide or ebb tide\r\nat the same hour along the whole length of any one meridian. But in\r\nthe present condition of the globe, where the oceans are separated by\r\ncontinents and broken by islands, the progress of the tidal waves is\r\nobstructed, deflected, and wholly stopped in a great variety of ways\r\nand places, so that the hours, amount, and behavior of the tides are\r\nexceedingly varied in different regions, and are often very puzzling,\r\nforming one of the most difficult matters with which the practical\r\nnavigator has to deal. Interference of tidal currents forms the\r\nMaelstrom, off the coast of Norway, whose revolution is reversed twice\r\ndaily, the classic Scylla and Charybdis, in the Straits of Messina, so\r\nmuch dreaded by the navigators of old, and many other whirlpools of\r\nless celebrity. The tidal wave sweeping northward across the Atlantic\r\nhas time to round the northern end of Scotland and flood the German\r\nOcean with southward swelling currents before the rising water pouring\r\ninto the southern end of the English Channel has time to push its way\r\nthrough that narrow and shallow passage; hence the two floods meet in\r\nthe Straits of Dover, which accounts for the miserable chop-sea so\r\nsadly prevalent in that unfortunate bit of water.\r\n\r\nThe natural height of the tide seems to be from two to five feet, as\r\nshown in the midst of the broad Pacific. “But when dashing against the\r\nland, and forced into deep gulfs and estuaries,” to quote Professor\r\nSimon Newcomb, “the accumulating tide-waters sometimes reach a very\r\ngreat height. On the eastern coast of North America, which is directly\r\nin the path of the great Atlantic wave, the tide rises on an average\r\nfrom 9 to 12 feet. In the Bay of Fundy, which opens its bosom to\r\nreceive the full wave, the tide, which at the entrance is 18 feet,\r\nrushes with great fury into that long and narrow channel, and swells\r\nto the enormous height of 60 feet, and even to 70 feet in the highest\r\nspring tides. In the Bristol Channel, on the coast of England, the\r\nspring tides rise to 40 feet, and swell to 50 in the English Channel at\r\nSt. Malo on the coast of France.”\r\n\r\nTo this cause is also due in some degree those great oceanic currents\r\nwhich form another striking fact in the history of the sea; but they\r\nare mainly due to temperature, wind, and the rotation of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe drops that make up a body of water are the most restless things in\r\nthe world; they are always sliding down the least slope, sinking out\r\nof the way of lighter substances, rising to let a heavier object pass\r\nbeneath them, or moving hither and thither in an ever hopeful search of\r\nthat levelness and quiet that we call equilibrium. Furthermore, when\r\nwater is heated it becomes lighter. Should, therefore, a portion of\r\nthe sea grow warmer than the remainder, it must and will rise to the\r\nsurface; and whenever a portion becomes cooled, it must and will sink.\r\n\r\nNow, under the continuous blazing sun of the torrid zone the sea-water\r\nnear the surface gets fairly warm,—having an average temperature of\r\nabout 85° along the equator,—while in the polar regions the ocean is\r\nalways chilled by permanent or floating ice until it is nearly cold\r\nenough to freeze; but these masses of warm and cold water cannot remain\r\nseparate in the universal ocean. The hot tropical flood, continually\r\nrising, _must_ flow away somewhere to find its level; and it can flow\r\nnowhere except toward the poles, for there the ever-sinking volume of\r\nchilled and therefore heavier water sucks it in to take its place,\r\nwhile it, in turn, creeps underneath toward the equator, there to fill\r\nthe gap which the escaping warm water leaves behind. So we know there\r\nis constantly going on an interchange of water—a constant flowing\r\n_away_ from the equator northward and southward on the surface, and a\r\nflowing in _toward_ the equator along the bottom; an endless springing\r\nup in the torrid zone and a steady settling down in the polar seas. One\r\nout of many proofs of this fact is that the thalassal abysses below the\r\ndepth of a mile or so are known to be ice-cold. This could not happen\r\nunless they were constantly filled and refilled with new water from the\r\ngreat coolers at the poles; for if the water at those depths should\r\nremain unchanged, it would soon become very warm from the heat of the\r\ninterior of the earth, whence it does constantly extract some heat.\r\n\r\nBut while this invisible _vertical circulation_ is going on, another\r\nmore visible and interesting set of movements is in progress on the\r\nsurface, forming what are known as _ocean currents_. These are vast\r\nrivers in the ocean flowing across its face in certain directions and\r\nto a certain depth, as rivers make their way along the land. They\r\nbegin and are kept going mainly by a union of the two causes already\r\nexplained—heat and wind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A STEAMER BORNE ASHORE BY AN EARTHQUAKE-WAVE.]\r\n\r\nThe heat of the sun at the equator, warming, lightening, and\r\nevaporating the water, constantly tends to draw the colder water from\r\nthe poles, most copiously from the South Pole; but the Antarctic water,\r\nhastening to the equator, is soon interrupted by the extremities of\r\nAustralia, Africa, and South America, and so split into three great\r\nbranches. That which passes into the South Atlantic goes on northward\r\nalong the western coast of Africa, part of it becoming so warm under\r\nthe hot sun there that it will not sink, but constantly comes more and\r\nmore to the surface, until it strikes against the great shoulder of\r\nGuinea and is turned sharply westward. Now it is squarely under the\r\ntrade-wind and headed the same way; constantly urged forward by this\r\nmoderate but endless tugging of the wind upon its waves, the current\r\ncan never swerve, but flows along the equator, and for half a dozen\r\ndegrees each side of it, straight across the Atlantic. South America,\r\nhowever, stands in its path, and the wedge-like coast of Brazil,\r\npointed with Cape St. Roque, splits this great river. Part of it now\r\nturns southward and swings back across toward Africa, making an eddy\r\na couple of thousand miles wide in the South Atlantic, while another\r\narm runs down the Patagonian coast. But by far the largest part of the\r\ndivided current is sent northward, past the coast of upper Brazil into\r\nthe Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, where it is well heated, and\r\nthence poured into the North Atlantic, to become widely celebrated as\r\nthe _Gulf Stream_.\r\n\r\nGathered in full force, the Gulf Stream flows northward close along\r\nthe coast of our Southern States at the rate of eighty or ninety miles\r\na day until Cape Hatteras gives it a swerve away, when it strikes out\r\nto sea and pushes straight across to Spain, where a branch leaves it\r\nand runs northward between Iceland and the British Islands, while the\r\nmain body turns southward to mingle again with the equatorial current\r\nfrom Africa and repeat its journey all over again. It is in the heart\r\nof this great circle of currents in the middle of the Atlantic that\r\nnavigators find that dreaded region of heat and calms which they call\r\nthe Doldrums; and here, too, float round and round the wide, buoyant\r\nmeadows of the Sargasso Sea.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile another most important cold stream is making its way through\r\nthe Atlantic, known as the Arctic current. It comes down out of\r\nBaffin’s Bay, joins a similar flood from the outer coast of Greenland,\r\nis thrown up to the surface by the Banks of Newfoundland (where meeting\r\nwarm air, it produces those thick and prolonged fogs so common in that\r\nregion), fills the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the bight between Nova\r\nScotia and Cape Cod with chilly water, and finally dips under the Gulf\r\nStream amid that commotion of winds and waters that makes the track\r\nof the steamships between New York and Europe the most tempestuous of\r\nocean highways. It is the mingling of these warm and cold waters there\r\nwhich is chiefly responsible for the stormy condition of the North\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific has a similar arrangement of circulation north and south of\r\nthe equator. The Antarctic waters form a cold stream named the Humboldt\r\ncurrent, which pours up the western side of South America, keeping the\r\nclimate down to a far more wintry condition than it is entitled to by\r\nlatitude, until it reaches the southern trade-winds, which sweep it\r\nwestward straight across the Pacific, where much of it is lost among\r\nthe archipelagoes of Oceanica, and the southern part flows onward into\r\nthe Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\nNorth of the Pacific equator a similar westward current moves steadily\r\nover the great waste of waters past the Sandwich Islands to the coast\r\nof China. From the Philippines and Japan northward, however, there\r\nis a far stronger flow, known to the Japanese as the Black Current\r\n(Kuroshiwo), which skirts the coast of Japan and the Kurile Islands,\r\nmakes these and Kamchatka habitable, then turns sharply east along\r\nthe front of the foggy Aleutian chain of islands, and broadening and\r\ncooling as it turns, swings down the temperate coast of Alaska and\r\ngradually disappears. These two great currents and their inclosed\r\neddies are far broader and less distinct than those of the North and\r\nSouth Atlantic, but they follow the same laws.\r\n\r\nIn a similar but lesser way the Indian Ocean has a strong westerly\r\nstream flowing straight across from Australia to South Africa, which\r\nis of immense help to ships returning from the East around the Cape of\r\nGood Hope. From Mozambique the water turns northward to make the return\r\nround, but here it is complicated by the peculiar conditions made by\r\nthe inflow and outflow of the Red Sea, Arabian Gulf, and so on, and\r\nby the disturbing influences of the monsoons, until it can hardly be\r\ndefined.\r\n\r\nOf all these currents none is as well marked as the Gulf Stream. Its\r\nblue water is in such contrast to the darker, greenish hue of the\r\nremainder of the ocean that sailors can often tell when they enter the\r\nedge of the current, half their vessel being in and half out of the\r\nstream. If you approach from the west you find that the water at first\r\nshows a warmth of only fifty or sixty degrees near the surface; but as\r\nyou sail on, this increases until, opposite Sandy Hook, you may get\r\nas high a reading on the thermometer as eighty degrees, and opposite\r\nFlorida above one hundred degrees. This difference in temperature\r\nbetween the eastern and western margins of the Gulf Stream is owing to\r\nthe presence of the great river of Arctic water flowing in an opposite\r\ndirection between the Gulf Stream and the shore. Off Florida the Gulf\r\nStream is about sixty miles wide; off New York it is over one hundred\r\nmiles in width, but is less sharply defined. Its depth is hard to\r\ndetermine, but certainly amounts to several hundred feet. It is worth\r\nremembering that, although some guesses had been made at it before, Dr.\r\nBenjamin Franklin was the first man to study the Gulf Stream and to\r\ntell us anything of its origin and course.\r\n\r\nThe way in which some of these ocean currents affect the weather of\r\nthe lands upon which they border shows how great is the influence of\r\nthe sea upon land-climates; indeed, it may be truthfully said that\r\nonly the continents and such great islands as Australia or Madagascar\r\nhave any climate essentially distinct from that of the ocean in their\r\nquarter of the globe. But the equability that would reign over an ocean\r\nof quiet water, determining the amount of cold and heat by regular\r\ngradation in latitude between the equator and the poles, is completely\r\nupset by the great current-movements I have outlined. Scotland, for\r\nexample, lies as far north as Labrador, and the latitude of London is\r\nabove that of Lake Superior, yet neither have those terrible frosts and\r\nheavy snows which prevail in Canada, and make Labrador a land of ice\r\nalmost uninhabitable. This difference is due almost wholly to the fact\r\nthat the Gulf Stream pours its warm flood against the coast of Great\r\nBritain, and even tempers the Norwegian coast, keeps Barentz’s Sea\r\nlargely free from summer ice, and clothes Spitzbergen with vegetation,\r\nalthough within ten degrees of the pole. Hence in the forests of\r\nnorthern Scandinavia Laps can dwell in much comfort on a line with the\r\nfrozen barren grounds north of Hudson Bay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A ROUGH NIGHT IN THE GULF STREAM.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the unfortunate coasts of Greenland are bathed in\r\nwater chilled by months of captivity near the pole, and loaded with\r\nice that cools down all the winds that blow ashore. Greenland itself\r\nis covered with an unbroken sheet of ice, hundreds or thousands of\r\nfeet thick, yet most of it is no farther north than Sweden. The whole\r\nnortheastern coast of America, down to Labrador, is incrusted with\r\nice; and the region south of the St. Lawrence has a similar climate to\r\nFinland; while even farther south, Boston, within the protecting arm of\r\nCape Cod, is in winter a city of frost and snow and fog from November\r\ntill April, when it really is little farther north than sunny Naples,\r\nwhere one laughs at winter.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in the Pacific Ocean, the northward movement of the great\r\nJapanese current makes the coast of China habitable and pleasant clear\r\nto the Sea of Okhotsk, gives the Aleutian archipelago a pretty decent\r\nclimate, and causes the islands and coasts of Alaska and British\r\nColumbia to nourish the most magnificent forests in America, and to\r\nhave a climate resembling that of Great Britain. Glasgow and Sitka\r\nare, in fact, in the same latitude, and under very similar climatic\r\nconditions, except that in Scotland there are no such lofty and cold\r\nmountains to precipitate constant rains as is the case along the\r\nnorthwestern margin of America.\r\n\r\nSimilar examples and contrasts might be drawn in other parts of the\r\nworld. The weather in the interior of continents is pretty much\r\nalike on similar latitudes the world round, varying with height; but\r\nthe climate of all sea-coasts is good or bad as a place to live, in\r\naccordance with the temperature of the water which the currents bring\r\nto that part of the ocean.\r\n\r\nBut the currents of the ocean influence something besides the weather.\r\nUpon them depends to a considerable extent whether a certain part of\r\nthe coast shall have one or another kind of animals dwelling in the\r\nsalt water. This is not so much true of fishes as it is of the mollusks\r\nor “shell-fish,” the worms that live in the mud of the tide-flats, the\r\nanemones, sea-urchins, starfish and little clinging people of the wet\r\nrocks, and of the jellyfishes, great and small, that swim about in the\r\nopen sea.\r\n\r\nNothing would injure most of these “small fry” more than a change in\r\nthe water making it a few degrees colder or warmer than they were\r\naccustomed to. Since the constant circulation of the currents keeps\r\nthe ocean water in all its parts almost precisely of the same density,\r\nand food seems about as likely to abound in one district as another,\r\nnaturalists have concluded that it is temperature which decides the\r\nextent of coast or of sea-area where any one kind of invertebrate\r\nanimal will be found. It thus happens that the life of Cuban waters is\r\ndifferent from that of our Carolina coast; and that, again, largely\r\nseparate from what you will see off New York; while Cape Cod seems to\r\nrun out as a partition between the shore life south of it and a very\r\ndifferent set of shells, sand-worms, and so forth, characteristic of\r\nthe colder waters to the northward.\r\n\r\nOut in the ocean, however, the warm current of the Gulf Stream forms\r\na genial pathway along which southern swimming animals, like the\r\nwondrously beautiful Portuguese-man-o’-war (Physalia), may wander\r\nnorthward for hundreds of miles beyond where they are found near shore;\r\nyet if by chance they stray outside the limits of the warm Gulf Stream,\r\nthey will at once be chilled to death, as happened once to millions of\r\ntile-fish.\r\n\r\nOcean currents carry floating burdens long distances. They bring the\r\nicebergs to form those terrible fogs of Alaska and Newfoundland; and\r\nthey often bear far away the logs that float out of tropical rivers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A YOUNG SHIP-RIGGER.]\r\n\r\nThese drifting logs often have plants growing upon them or contain\r\nquantities of seeds which are not injured by their short voyages.\r\nWhen, therefore, the coral polyps build up one of their reef-islands\r\nuntil it appears above the waves, thither the currents bring roots\r\nand seeds from neighboring islands, and quickly plant them upon the\r\nnew barren shores, so that in a few seasons the little islet becomes\r\ngreen and wooded and ready to hold its own against the winds and\r\nwaves. Moreover, the same drifting stuff will carry land animals\r\nas passengers,—insects, snails of many kinds, reptiles, and even\r\nfour-footed beasts,—and so not only give the island a vegetation, but\r\npopulate it with various of the smaller animals. This seems to you,\r\nperhaps, a very accidental and haphazard way of fitting out a country\r\nso that presently it may support human beings, nor is it the only\r\nmeans by which barren islands become productive; but it is important\r\nas far as it goes, and when we study into the distribution of plants\r\nand animals in an archipelago, we are pretty sure to find those of the\r\nsame sort upon islands that lie in the same current—even to the human\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE BUILDING AND RIGGING OF SHIPS\r\n\r\n\r\nAs late as 1861 an exploring ship was visited by natives of Western\r\nAustralia, riding simple rough logs. To smooth and sharpen the log’s\r\nend and then to hollow it out has been thought to be the first step\r\ntaken by primitive man in his progress toward a boat; but I think the\r\ndugout probably came later, or at any rate no earlier, than the folding\r\nof bark into a trough and tying up the ends, as some savages are still\r\ncontent to do. In North America, where materials were favorable,\r\nthis germ developed into the very highest type of canoe—the Algonkin\r\nbirch-bark. It may have been an attempt to imitate the bark canoe in a\r\nmore durable form which led to the laborious hollowing of dugouts; but\r\nhere again, in regions where suitable trees grew, the art developed\r\nso highly as to produce the great sea-boats of the Papuans and our\r\nNorthwest Coast Indians, carved from a single log, yet able to carry\r\nsixty or more persons and their luggage. Such boats as these, when\r\nprovided with sails, are practically “ships,” and satisfy every need of\r\ntheir owners.\r\n\r\nAnother root of naval architecture lies in the raft, which long ago\r\nreached a high degree of usefulness in the sea-going balsa of western\r\nSouth America. It is probable that the South Sea catamaran is a clever\r\noutgrowth of experience with a raft. In Polynesia it took the form of\r\ntwo great canoes, exactly equal, fastened close together and covered\r\nby a single central deck; and such are the seaworthiness and speed of\r\nthese double boats, that the Polynesians voyage hundreds of miles in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSimilar in purpose—namely, to insure stability—are the various\r\noutriggers that at once characterize and distinguish among themselves\r\nthe native craft of the South Seas. This device consists of a beam of\r\nthe lightest obtainable wood, usually about half as long as the canoe,\r\nwhich rests upon the water parallel to and a few feet away from the\r\nside of the boat, and is connected with its gunwale by elastic rods or\r\nplanks. Sometimes these are covered, or partly covered, by a light\r\nplatform, and there are many variations in form; but the idea in all\r\ncases is to keep the boat from overturning.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the world logs could be obtained large enough only for\r\na narrow bottom or hollowed keel, and the remainder of the boat was\r\nbuilt up of planks and pieces ingeniously pegged and knit together with\r\ntreenails, ratan, and cords made of vegetable fibers that tightened\r\nwhen wet. The Madras surf-boats are a familiar example in civilized\r\nwaters of boats made in this way which have great elasticity, and\r\nout of them have developed, without much change, the swift proas of\r\nthe Malays, and the junks of China, Korea, and Japan. One device for\r\nstitching these boats firmly together was the leaving of ridges on the\r\ninner side of the planks or pieces, through holes in which they could\r\nbe tied to each other and to the inner framework without making a hole\r\nreaching the outside. This system seems to have been earlier than the\r\nuse of treenails.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROA, WITH OUTRIGGER.]\r\n\r\nOf similar construction, apparently, were the boats of the Egyptians\r\nand other peoples about the eastern end of the Mediterranean and the\r\nRed Sea, which, as far back as three thousand years before Christ, at\r\nleast, had reached the size and capabilities of true ships, making, as\r\nwe shall presently see, extensive sea voyages. Pictures of them remain\r\nin the very ancient tombs, and show that the planking consisted of\r\npieces about three feet square, which were laid on overlapping, like\r\nshingles on a roof, and fastened to the framework by wooden treenails.\r\nThe Phenicians, and their pupils the Greeks and Romans, improved on\r\nthese methods in various ways, at last substituting iron, copper, and\r\nbronze nails or bolts (which would not rust) for the wooden pegs of\r\ntheir ancestors.\r\n\r\nAll of these boats and those of all western Europe (of which the best\r\noutside the Mediterranean were the vikings’ ships) differed in one\r\nessential point of construction from Oriental ships: instead of making\r\nthe shell of the vessel, and fitting into it a framework of connected\r\nbraces, as the Malays and Polynesians did (and yet do), they laid a\r\nkeel, bending it up or setting into it stem- and stern-posts at the\r\nends, and inserted along its sides curving upright timbers, well styled\r\n“ribs,” which swelled out amidships, and narrowed in forward and aft,\r\nmaking a skeleton of the shape the hull was intended to be. Finally,\r\nover and upon this well-braced framework were securely fastened the\r\nplanks, which were narrow and ran lengthwise in every case except\r\nthat of the ancient Nile boats. The Scandinavian vikings developed a\r\ncraft of their own, one of the most interesting of the ancient ships;\r\nand to these northern craftsmen is traceable the principal influence\r\nthat has shaped British (and consequently American) ship-building and\r\nseamanship. This early Scandinavian boat was always made of oak, sharp\r\nat both ends, and rather shallow, the general form being much like that\r\nof a modern whaleboat, with a great rounding keel—if, indeed, this\r\nwonderful sea-craft may not be a lineal descendant of the viking ship.\r\nThe hewn planks were attached to the keel and to the ribs (usually\r\nsingle, naturally bent V-shaped prongs of oak) in a most ingenious and\r\nserviceable manner, and they were always overlapping or clinker (_i.\r\ne._, clencher) built. Several of these and other prehistoric boats have\r\nbeen found buried in peat-moss and in mounds in Germany, Denmark, and\r\nScandinavia, and have been described by various writers.\r\n\r\nThe motive power of all the early boats was found in human arms,\r\nwielding paddles or oars. It is said that the oldest forms of paddles\r\nof which we have any record among the Egyptian or Assyrian hieroglyphs\r\nshow them to have been shaped somewhat like the arm and hand, and that\r\nsimilar paddles were to be seen a few decades ago on the canals in\r\nHolland. This is natural, because undoubtedly the first paddle ever\r\nused was the naked hand. Short paddles were soon found less powerful\r\nthan long ones; but in order to work the latter it was necessary to\r\nbrace them against something in the middle. Notches were therefore cut\r\nin the edge of the boat, or thole-pins were inserted, the paddle became\r\nan oar, and by and by boatmen learned the art of feathering, and so\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nSteering could be done of old, as now, with a turn of the rearmost\r\npaddle in a canoe, and as canoes enlarged, the steering-paddle was\r\nlengthened. As the sterns of the ancient boats were usually either\r\nsharp, like the prows, or else built up into an ornamental height, the\r\nmost convenient place for the steering-oar was over the right side,\r\nwhere it was balanced in a loop of cable, or otherwise, as close to the\r\nafter end of the boat as practicable, and then a cross-piece extended\r\ninboard from the handle, enabling the steersman to move it more easily\r\nby giving him the benefit of leverage. Such was the arrangement of\r\nsteering-gear in all the ancient Mediterranean boats, and it is to a\r\nsimilar arrangement in the sea-going craft of our northern ancestors\r\nthat we owe our words _stern_ and _starboard_, which originally\r\nmeant “steering-place” and “steering-side.” The modern rudder is\r\nsubstantially the same oar, set upright, tiller and all, and hinged to\r\nthe stern-post; in fact, the word has descended from the old Teutonic\r\nname for “oar,” and all gradations between steering-oar and true rudder\r\nmay still be found.\r\n\r\nThough some romantic stories are told by the old mythologists as\r\nto its origin, the idea of rigging was as natural and practical in\r\nits development as that of hull or steering-gear. That a strong\r\nbreeze moves a canoe, and that, if a man in a canoe holds his robe\r\noutstretched or a thick bush upright, the force will send him along\r\nwithout the labor of paddling, and lengthwise rather than sidewise,\r\nbecause that is the direction of least resistance, were facts quickly\r\nand gratefully seized upon by the earliest boatmen. To have a skin\r\nready for the purpose, and to set up a pole and ropes to hold it in\r\nposition, were easy matters; yet in this simple arrangement you have\r\nthe first sail.\r\n\r\nBut skins were too heavy and valuable for such a purpose, except in\r\nsuch limited circumstances as those of the Arctic Eskimos.\r\n\r\nPersons who spent much time on the water, therefore, like the most\r\nancient Egyptians and the islanders of the Chinese and South seas, soon\r\ndevised a way of weaving rushes or splints of bamboo into broad mats,\r\nand thus were able, on account of their lightness, to carry much larger\r\nand more effective sails, which were kept outstretched by one or more\r\ncross-poles or spars, and could be taken down quickly. Many such sails\r\nare in use to this day not only among Asiatic and African boatmen, but\r\non the northwest coast of Canada. A fine example hangs above my desk as\r\nI write.\r\n\r\nWith the discovery of how to make cloth and cordage of woolen, silken,\r\nhempen, and cotton fibers (and in Egypt of papyrus), came a still\r\nbetter material for ropes and sails, since cloth was so much lighter\r\nthat a far greater extent of it could be spread than before; its\r\nflexibility enabled it to be handled, changed, and rolled up snugly,\r\nand its cheapness encouraged its use and the practice of navigation\r\ngenerally. We read of silken sails on the royal barges of medieval\r\ntimes, but they could hardly have exceeded in strength or elegance\r\nthose of the fine Phenician ships that carried the commerce of the\r\nworld twenty-five centuries ago. “Fine linen with broidered work from\r\nEgypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail,” exclaims\r\nthe sacred chronicler (Ezekiel xxvii. 7). Hempen cloth, indeed, was\r\npreferred for sails until the present century, as is expressed in our\r\nword _canvas_, which is derived from the Latin name of flax; but now\r\ncotton has mainly superseded it.\r\n\r\nAnciently the sails were often colored, purple or vermilion being the\r\nbadge of a monarch or an admiral. Black denoted mourning. “In some\r\ncases the topsail seems to have been colored, while the sail below\r\nwas plain; and frequently a patchwork of colors was produced by using\r\ndifferent stuffs.” Various inscriptions and devices were also woven or\r\npainted on the sails, sometimes in gold. The Venetians and Greeks do\r\nthe same to this day, adding a gaudy feature to the lovely Levantine\r\nsea-scenery; and the sails of the North Sea fishermen are turned to a\r\nrich red and yellow by the tanning mixture in which they soak their\r\ncanvas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REEFING A TOPSAIL IN A STORM.]\r\n\r\nAs for the shape, all rigs seem reducible to two types—the lateen and\r\nthe square. The former is characteristic of the eastern half of the\r\nworld, the latter of the western half, including primitive America,\r\nwhere, so far as I know, only plain, rectangular sails were ever made\r\nby the Indians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A HONG-KONG “PULL-AWAY” BOAT.\r\n\r\nShowing method of hoisting and reefing matting sails.]\r\n\r\nThere must be some good reason for a broad division like this, and\r\nit is found in the different conditions which eastern and western\r\nseamen had to meet. The lateen seems to have originated in the Indian\r\nOcean, is seen wherever Arabs are, and has been taken eastward by the\r\nMalays as far into the South Sea Islands as their influence extended.\r\nIt is a huge, triangular canvas extended at a steep angle by a long,\r\nflexible yard balanced across the mast to which it is loosely hung,\r\nand controlled by a sheet attached to the free corner. It is thus very\r\nlofty, and therefore suitable to a region of steady and usually light\r\nwinds. This is the characteristic rig of the Arab dhow—a model that has\r\ncome down from remote antiquity and is capable of excellent service on\r\nthe northern and eastern coasts of Africa, where it prevails. It was\r\nprobably in a small vessel of this kind that the Apostle Paul suffered\r\nshipwreck; and an outgrowth and perfection of it is the dahabiyeh\r\nof the Nile, now become famous as a tourists’ pleasure-boat, whose\r\nimmensely lofty sail is precisely adapted to catch every faint breath\r\nthat comes across the river from the deserts. Such sails are spread\r\nlike the great pointed wings of an albatross over the narrow decks\r\nof the Malayan “flying proas” and other swift South Sea craft, and\r\nurge upon their fleet errands the xebecs, saics, feluccas, and other\r\nlight craft of the Levant and Barbary coasts, identified with former\r\npiracy and modern smuggling, as well as with fishing and freighting.\r\nSome of these boats have two or three masts, the xebec and felucca\r\nbeing notable because of the curious forward rake of the foremast;\r\nand in that extremely picturesque Portuguese fishing-boat called the\r\nmuleta there are, in addition to the big lateen, a huge free second\r\nsail ballooning out to leeward from the tip of the yard, and a host of\r\nlittle flying jibs forward, which somebody has well likened to a flock\r\nof birds hovering about the prow. Good examples of lateen-rigged boats\r\nmay be seen in Louisiana, built and manned by the Greek, Maltese, and\r\nSicilian fishermen.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of handling in rough or squally weather this long yard\r\nand expansive canvas makes it unsuitable for such weather as prevails\r\nin the western Mediterranean or on the Atlantic; and to meet these\r\nstormy and frequently changing conditions, and obtain a rig with which\r\nthey could beat to windward, the earliest rough-water seamen devised\r\nsquare sails. What the rig of the ancient far-voyaging Phenician ships\r\nwas we have no means of knowing, but the indications are that they\r\ncarried lug sails, which appear to be the simplest and earliest of the\r\n“square” forms; that is, sails suspended from short cross-yards, and\r\ncontrolled by ropes (sheets) attached to their lower corners. Such at\r\nleast were the sails of the Roman and Greek merchant and war vessels of\r\nthe classical era, and they persist to-day in the local fishing-smacks\r\nof the stormy Adriatic.\r\n\r\nThe true home of the square-sailed craft, however, was northern Europe,\r\nwhere the Norwegian, Dutch, and Norman coasters and fishermen of to-day\r\nprobably represent fairly well the rigs of the bold viking boats of\r\ntwelve or fifteen centuries ago.\r\n\r\nOf the slow development of ship-building during the middle ages we have\r\nlittle information, but in the fourteenth century we begin to hear of a\r\nrevival in the art, as, indeed, was needful when the long voyages were\r\nto be undertaken which the discovery of the mariner’s compass had then\r\nrendered possible. In this revival the Venetians and Genoese took the\r\nlead, but the English were not far behind. There was a large variety\r\nof vessels in that day, rude though they were, and called by names we\r\nshould hardly recognize.\r\n\r\nThough the hulls of these vessels were large and tight, their shape\r\nwas poorly adapted for speed or for safety in bad weather. Their decks\r\nwere built up into immensely high structures at the stern and bows,\r\nafter the old galley model, and to form forts for soldiers. Our word\r\n“forecastle” reminds us of this old usage. Their masts were single\r\nsticks,—not divided into topmasts,—and hence, necessarily, were thick\r\nand heavy; and they bore upon their summits large “top-castles” where\r\nmarines stood in battle to shoot down upon the enemy’s decks. This\r\nweight above, with the height of surface exposed to the wind and the\r\nclumsy rigging, made it impossible for them to sail safely except with\r\na fair and gentle wind (they never attempted it otherwise), and they\r\nwere required to carry an enormous quantity of ballast. There was\r\nso little room for anything except armament, sleeping-berths, and a\r\ncooking-room in the war-ships that every war fleet had to take with it\r\nsmall vessels carrying provisions; and the case was little better in\r\nrespect to merchant vessels.\r\n\r\nThe ships in which Vasco da Gama, Columbus, the Cabots, and other\r\nexplorers did their marvelous work were no better than this. Strangely\r\ninefficient they seem to us, and we wonder that some of the simplest\r\ncontrivances in rigging were not adopted centuries before they came\r\ninto use until we remember that it was not for long, speedy voyages\r\nthat vessels were intended previous to the sixteenth century (with\r\ncertain exceptions in northern seas), but simply as a means of carrying\r\nslowly from one coast-port to another a great number of men or huge\r\ncargoes.\r\n\r\nHowever, as the known world widened and trade grew, inventions by\r\nprivate ship-owners continually improved the rigging, though it would\r\nbe hard to find a class of men slower to change old ways for new than\r\nthe seamen. Columbus’s “caravel” had four short masts, the forward one\r\nhaving a square lug-sail and the three after masts lateens. It was\r\nvery gradually, indeed, that lateens were given up, and most curious\r\ncombinations of sails were to be seen in this transition period of the\r\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The old-fashioned Mediterranean\r\nbarca, for example, had as foremast the forward-raking “trinchetto”\r\nof the felucca, with a huge lateen, while the mainmast bore three\r\nsquare sails and the mizzen two lugs; and in addition to this two banks\r\nof oars were provided! In fact, it was not until 1800 that English\r\nfrigates substituted a spanker for the lateen-rigged mizzen.\r\n\r\nAnother curiosity of rigging possessed by these solidly built,\r\nbeautifully carved vessels (no such exterior decoration has been seen\r\nsince as adorned the ships of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries)\r\nwas the quaint little spritsail-topmast. By this time the single\r\nheavy pole-mast had been superseded by the three built-up masts and\r\ntopmasts, braced by stays, made accessible by rope ladders (shrouds),\r\nand carrying several tiers of topsails instead of only one. A bowsprit\r\nhad been added, also, and this became almost a fourth mast, so loaded\r\nwere it and its stays with various small sails. Its outer end bore\r\nthis miniature spritsail-mast, with topmast, shrouds, and tiny sails\r\nall complete, surmounted by a pole-head, or jack-staff, upon which was\r\nhoisted the flag since known as the jack, and always now carried at the\r\nprow of any national boat or ship, even such as the shapeless monitors.\r\n\r\nBut gradually, out of the experience of long voyages, the competition\r\nof merchants, and as an effect of improved gunnery and consequent\r\nchanges in naval tactics, the lofty deck-structures, great tops,\r\nneedless outworks, and odd sails, like this spritsail, were got rid of,\r\nand vessels were trimmed down and equalized until they became, as now,\r\n“ship-shape, Bristol-fashion.”\r\n\r\nThe rigging of modern sailing-vessels is divided into “standing” and\r\n“running”; the former includes the masts, their stays, now generally\r\nmade of wire, and such other rope-work as is not adjustable.\r\n\r\nThe sails, also, may be assigned to two classes: first, those attached\r\nto a mast, with or without boom and gaff, or to a stay, which are\r\ncalled fore-and-aft sails because they may be ranged lengthwise of the\r\nship; and, second, those suspended by their upper and lower edges to or\r\nbetween spars or “yards” swung across the mast, and known as “square”\r\nsails, the lowermost of which are really lugs. All the variations\r\nof shape seen in America, except the rare and local lateens, can be\r\ncounted in one or the other of these classes.\r\n\r\nThe styles of rig visible in American waters are not many, and are\r\neasily learned. Let us begin with the simplest—that having one mast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT CARAVELS.\r\n\r\nCopied from old manuscripts and tapestries.]\r\n\r\nThe _cat-boat_ (_i. e._, cat-rigged boat) is one having a simple\r\npole-mast stepped very near the bow, and a fore-and-aft sail laced to a\r\ngaff and boom and managed by a sheet. This is the rig of the ordinary\r\nAmerican sail-boat, which is noted for its ability in pointing up into\r\nthe wind. In England it is known as a una-boat. Sometimes the peak\r\nof the sail is sustained by a little loose spar called a “sprit,”\r\ninstead of a gaff. In the chapter on Yachting will be found further\r\nillustrations of these small rigs.\r\n\r\nA _sloop_ has one mast (with topmast) set well back from the stem, and\r\na bowsprit. The sloop-rig consists of a fore-and-aft mainsail, spread\r\nby means of a boom and gaff, a gaff-topsail, a forestaysail, and one\r\nor more jibs. A _cutter_ is now substantially the same thing, though\r\nformerly somewhat distinguished. Both are derived, probably, from the\r\nnorthern lugger, and old-time pictures show queer intermediate forms,\r\noften having a square topsail instead of a gaff. Thus the earlier of\r\nthe Hudson River sloops, which were not only the freight-carriers but\r\nthe packet-boats between New York and Albany from the time the Dutch\r\nintroduced them until steamboats took their place, had the top of the\r\nmainsail supported, lug-fashion, by a short yard, and carried above\r\nthat a square topsail; but this rig was steadily modified toward the\r\nmodern type to make it faster and safer in the sudden squalls that\r\nbeset this hill-girt river.\r\n\r\nOf two-masted rigs, the oldest is the _brig_, which has square sails on\r\nboth masts, just like the main and mizzen masts of a full-rigged ship.\r\nThen there is the _brigantine_, a slight modification of the brig,\r\nand the _hermaphrodite brig_, or _brig-schooner_, with fore-and-aft\r\nsails on the after mast. This kind of vessel has been greatly modified\r\n(one of its most extraordinary forms was the _ketch_), is less common\r\nnow than formerly, and took its name, which is derived from the same\r\nsource as “brigand,” from the fact that it was the most common rig of\r\nthe pirates of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Its place was\r\nlargely taken for small vessels by a purely American invention, and\r\none of the greatest of Yankee notions—the _schooner_. The schooner\r\nwas originally small, and had two masts; but now is often built of\r\ngreat size, with as many as five or six masts, each of which has a\r\nfore-and-aft rig—that is, a sloop’s mainsail and gaff-topsail on every\r\nmast, with forestaysail and several jibs in front, and staysails\r\nbetween. Sometimes a square sail is placed on the foretopmast, which\r\nmakes the vessel a _topsail schooner_. The first one was built by a\r\nGloucester sea-captain about 1817, and proved so satisfactory that all\r\nthe fishing-fleet were soon rigged in that way, whence the idea has\r\nspread to all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nUntil recently, however, vessels large enough to have three masts were\r\nalways “square-rigged,” as _barks_, _barkentines_, or _ships_; for,\r\nalthough we have come to speak of any big vessel as a “ship,” yet in\r\nproper nautical language a ship is a vessel rigged in a particular way,\r\nand it is nothing else. In fact, in olden times they were sometimes\r\nvery small—too small to be economical, as we now know. The “Naval\r\nChronicle” for 1807 contained an account of a full-rigged ship of\r\nonly thirty-six tons’ burden, which for one hundred and thirty years\r\nprevious to that date had been cruising about the English coast, and\r\nmay be doing so yet, for aught I know.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FIJI ISLAND OUT-RIGGED CANOE, APPROACHING A\r\nFULL-RIGGED SHIP HOVE-TO.]\r\n\r\nMasts have their proper names: the tallest is in the middle of the\r\nvessel, and is called the _mainmast_; the next tallest stands in front\r\nof it, and is the _foremast_; and the third is in the stern, and is\r\nnamed _mizzenmast_, because it carries the mizzen (sail). All the\r\nrigging, except that belonging to the bowsprit, is repeated for each\r\nmast, and each piece is named with reference to the mast or part of the\r\nmast or appropriate sail to which it belongs: as, for example, main\r\nshrouds, fore shrouds, mizzen shrouds, mizzen-royal, maintopsail yard,\r\nforetopmast studdingsail downhaul, and so on. In a proper full-rigged\r\nship all the sails upon the masts, except the spanker, are square,\r\nand are named from the sections of the mast opposite which they hang.\r\nCounting from the deck to the truck, or tiptop of the mast, they are\r\nas follows: on the mainmast, mainsail or maincourse, maintopsail,\r\nmaintopgallant-sail, mainroyal, and skysail; on the foremast, foresail\r\nor forecourse, foretopsail, foretopgallant, foreroyal, and skysail;\r\non the mizzenmast, cross-jack (and behind it the spanker, mizzen, or\r\ndriver), mizzentopsail, mizzentopgallant, mizzen-royal, and skysail.\r\nThe bowsprit sails are the forestaysail, foretopmast staysail, jib,\r\nflying jib, and outer jib, or jibstaysail. Each of the stays running\r\ndiagonally from mast to mast bears a triangular sail known by the name\r\nof the particular stay on which it hangs, as maintopmast staysail, and\r\nso on—nine in all. In addition to all this, a little sail is sometimes\r\nset above the skysail, and another under the bowsprit, while out\r\nbeyond the ends of the yards are often extended light additional spars\r\ncarrying studdingsails. In favorable weather, when the captain wishes\r\nto “crowd all on,” as sometimes can be done for days and weeks together\r\nbefore the trades, almost forty sails may be spread, and the ship moves\r\ngrandly along under a swaying cloud of canvas that reaches far beyond\r\nher rails on each side, and towers more than one hundred feet into the\r\nsteady air.\r\n\r\nBut the cost of building, maintaining, and handling these grand\r\nfabrics is so great that they are steadily diminishing in numbers,\r\nand perhaps are destined before long to disappear altogether from the\r\nseas to which they have lent so much picturesqueness and romance. The\r\nsupremacy of the schooner seems likely to prove complete. Unwilling to\r\nconcede everything at once, many vessels are now rigged with square\r\nsails on the foremast and mainmast and fore-and-aft sails on the mizzen\r\n(a _bark_), or square sails on the foremast only, and the others\r\nschooner-rigged (a _barkentine_); but even these are disappearing in\r\nfavor of the three-masted or four-masted schooner. This is due to the\r\nfact that the schooner rig will sail closer to the wind and gives\r\nas much force in proportion as the ship style, while it is far less\r\nexpensive to build, and more quickly and easily managed, not requiring\r\nnearly as many men, and therefore being cheaper to run as well as\r\nto set up. It is for these reasons that I have called it one of the\r\ngreatest of Yankee notions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MULETA, OR PORTUGUESE LATEEN-RIGGED FISHING-BOAT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nEARLY VOYAGES AND EXPLORATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I—PREVIOUS TO THE DISCOVERY OF AMERICA\r\n\r\nWherever it may have been that man first appeared upon the earth, the\r\nperiod must certainly have been incalculably long ago, for he had time\r\nto spread to all parts of the habitable globe long before any sort of\r\nrecord begins. Little, if any, part of the world has yet been found\r\nwhere the evidences of man’s residence in the long-forgotten past do\r\nnot exist. So long ago that all tradition of it is forgotten, and only\r\nthe imperishable stone implements they used remain as traces of their\r\npresence, mankind had reached and settled the farthest northern and\r\neastern coasts of Europe and Asia, and the southern extremities of\r\nAfrica and India. These might have been reached by land; but similar\r\ntraces exist in many islands which, so far as we can see, could never\r\nhave been connected with each other or with any continent by lands\r\nnow submerged (as perhaps has been the case in some other islands)\r\nsince man originated. Such places, then, could have been reached and\r\ncolonized only by means of boats, and that at an exceedingly remote\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nSome hint of what these prehistoric navigators might have been able to\r\ndo may be gathered from the performances that we know of in the South\r\nSea, where almost every island and coral atoll that could support a\r\ncolony has apparently been inhabited, since long before even tradition\r\nbegins, although some of them, like the Hawaiian group, are separated\r\nfrom all others by hundreds of miles of open sea.\r\n\r\nIt is exceedingly interesting and suggestive to read in a work like\r\nProfessor Friedrich Ratzel’s “History of Mankind,” of the dispersion\r\nof population over the islands of the South Pacific Ocean, where a\r\nmixed population of black and yellow races possessed themselves of\r\nthe whole of Oceanica long before white men had even heard of that\r\npart of the world. This astounding fact gains in significance when\r\nwe remember that wide tracts of very deep ocean divide these islands,\r\nmany of which are so small that they were found by exploring navigators\r\nonly with difficulty. Cook and Beechey and other early voyagers note\r\nfinding upon certain islands people who had come thither in their own\r\nboats over distances of six or eight hundred miles; and there are many\r\ninstances of castaways surviving voyages of one thousand or fifteen\r\nhundred miles, even against the trade-winds. But these involuntary\r\nvoyages were no longer than many others undertaken for war or trade,\r\nor because of famine or a mere love of wandering. Over-population of\r\nthe limited spaces of most islands and groups led to the colonization\r\nof others; and it must often have been necessary to go far away to\r\nseek unoccupied or thinly peopled refuges. This could not have been\r\ndone had men not been good shipwrights, not only, but careful students\r\nof the heavens by whose sun and moon and stars they steered, aiding\r\nthemselves with charts made of sticks. The remotest groups, like the\r\nSandwich Islands and Easter Island, were found and settled too long\r\nago even for tradition to retain more than a fabulous story about it.\r\n“These Vikings of the Pacific,” says Ratzel, “continued to discover\r\neven small and remote islets. In the whole of the Pacific there is not\r\none island of any size of which it was left to Europeans to demonstrate\r\nthe habitability.” It has even been argued that the continent of\r\nAmerica was peopled by Pacific Islanders, who made their way to it\r\nfrom Polynesia; but of this there is no direct evidence, and it seems\r\nunlikely, because the prevailing winds and currents flow from South\r\nAmerica, rather than toward it, in this part of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nBut leaving these dim old times when barbarous men voyaged far and wide\r\nover seas, and races mingled that were born on opposite sides of wide\r\nwaters, let us note what traveling our civilized ancestors did.\r\n\r\nThe evidences of ruined walls, graves, carvings, and stone tools\r\nshow that that earliest of civilized races of which we now have any\r\nknowledge—the Hittites—were acquainted not only with the coasts of\r\nthe Mediterranean Sea, but had boldly rounded the headlands of Spain,\r\nskirted the stormy Bay of Biscay, and settled colonies in England\r\nand France. Who were these Hittites? They were an Asiatic people,\r\ndwelling in the Taurus Mountains of the eastern part of Asia Minor,\r\nwho increased into the most powerful nation of that part of the world\r\nabout two thousand years before Christ, and carried on wars with the\r\nEgyptians, among others, until at last they were overcome by the rise\r\nof the empire of Assyria, north of them, about eleven hundred years\r\nbefore Christ. Doubtless they explored the African coast somewhat south\r\nof the Red Sea, and very likely knew the Persian Gulf and the route\r\nto India. My own opinion is that we are likely to give the people of\r\nantiquity too little credit rather than too much in the direction of a\r\nknowledge of geography.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there was rising along the Mediterranean from Palestine\r\nnorthward the most able commercial race of antiquity, who styled\r\nthemselves Canaanites, as in the Bible, but whom the Greeks called\r\nPhenicians, the name by which we know them best. Their capitals were\r\nthe cities Tyre and Sidon, the ruins of which are still to be seen\r\non the Syrian coast a little way south of Beirut, and the wealth and\r\ncommercial power of which will give us some interesting paragraphs\r\nfor a future chapter. Suffice it here to say that their rulers were\r\nforemost among the loosely organized “nations” between the Nile and the\r\nEuphrates, and that they maintained their power through a long period,\r\nnot only by their wealth and enterprise as traders, but mainly through\r\ntheir skill and energy as navigators. As we shall see when we come to\r\nconsider their commerce in Chapter VII, they excelled in the building\r\nof ships, in an understanding of how to steer long courses by the\r\nheavenly bodies, and in sea knowledge generally. It is well known that\r\nthe Phenicians traded in their ships down the west coast of Africa to\r\nand beyond the Canary Islands, which they also visited; made repeated\r\nvoyages to the French coast and the British Islands; and may very\r\nlikely have gone around into the Baltic, for they knew of its amber,\r\nthough this might have been obtained by the overland trade routes. It\r\nis believed that they ascertained that Africa was, in fact, a huge\r\nisland; for it was to prove this supposition that Pharaoh Necho (or\r\nNaku or Neku) II, an enlightened Egyptian monarch who reigned in the\r\nsixth century before Christ, hired a crew of Phenician seamen to man\r\nan expedition whose purpose it was to circumnavigate Africa. These men\r\nstarted down the Red Sea in 611 B. C., and in 605 B. C. came sailing\r\nhome through the Strait of Gibraltar, to the delight of their friends\r\nand confusion of a kingdom full of I-told-you-sos.[1] Just twenty\r\ncenturies elapsed before any one else repeated that feat, so far as I\r\nknow;, and no wonder it was forgotten. This same Necho II did even more\r\nfor maritime commerce, for he attempted to complete the canal, begun\r\nlong before his time, connecting the Mediterranean with the Red Sea,\r\nand seems to have made a passage along which barges and small boats\r\nmight be towed, which remained open for many centuries, and in part\r\nfollowed the line now covered by the Suez Canal. Earlier than that\r\nDarius, the Persian conqueror of Egypt, had dug a navigable canal from\r\nthe Nile to the Red Sea; and this shows that there must have been large\r\ntraffic in both seas at that time to justify such tasks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EARLY ROMAN BIREME.]\r\n\r\nBy this time the power and prosperity of Tyre and Sidon had declined,\r\nand Carthage, originally a colonial city, had become the most important\r\ncenter of Phenician influence; and from this port there sailed a\r\ncentury later (perhaps about 500 B. C.) an exploring expedition under\r\na Carthaginian king named Hanno, intended to study and establish trade\r\nwith the West African coast. It was a large and powerful fleet, said\r\nto number sixty galleys; and that women were taken as well as men\r\nshows that it was intended to form settlements at suitable points,\r\nas, indeed, was done. The account of it has been preserved in a short\r\nwriting called the “Periplus,” by an ancient but unknown Greek; and\r\nthis inscription is regarded by most scholars as entirely authentic,\r\nsince all its details conform to modern knowledge, even though it is\r\nimpossible to identify surely the various points mentioned. It tells us\r\nthat the terminus of Hanno’s exploration was an island beyond a gulf\r\ncalled Noti Cornu, in which he found a company of hairy women, whom\r\nthe interpreters called _gorillas_. It was in memory of this that the\r\nmanlike apes which a few years ago were discovered on the west coast of\r\nAfrica received the same name; but they are not known anywhere north of\r\nthe Kamerun Mountains, while the farthest point any critic is willing\r\nto believe reached by Hanno is the Bight of Benin, some distance north\r\nof the Kameruns. It is easy to believe that the inquiring Carthaginians\r\nmight have heard of these apes,—or perhaps of chimpanzees, now found\r\nas far north as the Gambia River,—and reported actually seeing them,\r\nin order to add glory to their name. At any rate, this expedition\r\nincreased largely the ancient knowledge of the sea in that direction;\r\nand navigators now knew the shores of the Atlantic from the Gulf of\r\nGuinea to the North Sea; but there the knowledge of the world seems\r\nto have rested for more than a dozen centuries, principally, no\r\ndoubt, because there seemed nothing beyond, either north or south, to\r\ninvite the merchants who then, as ever since, have been the principal\r\npromoters of discovery. It is only within the past century that\r\nvoyages of discovery have been undertaken purely for the sake of the\r\nincrease of knowledge. Previous to that the object was always either\r\nmilitary conquest or the extension of trade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHIP OF PTOLEMY PHILOPATOR.\r\n\r\n(About 240 B. C. Banks of oars and lug-sails.)]\r\n\r\nAttention was now turned to the eastern seas, overland routes to India\r\nand even to China having become well known both to conquering armies\r\nand to mercantile caravans. The coasts of Abyssinia, of Arabia, of the\r\nPersian Gulf, and of western India were settled by a semi-civilized\r\npeople for a thousand, perhaps two thousand, years before the Christian\r\nera; but they were broken into many independent tribes; and their\r\nships, if they had any, only crept from one harbor to another near\r\nby, and neither knew nor cared what lay beyond the farther headlands.\r\nAs time went on, however, and strong kingdoms arose in Egypt, Arabia,\r\nSyria, and Persia, consolidating these scattered tribes into nations,\r\nit became necessary to learn the sea-routes between more distant ports.\r\nThus it came about that while the Pharaohs still flourished, Arabic\r\ncommerce extended regularly along the coast of Abyssinia, and doubtless\r\nas far southward as Zanzibar, while the Malays had probably already\r\nreached and colonized Madagascar. There seems no reason to doubt that\r\nthose remarkable ruins in stone which the late Mr. Thomas Bent has\r\nstudied at and near Zimbabwe, in Mashonaland, East Africa, are the work\r\nof Arabian gold-miners, made perhaps a thousand or more years ago; and\r\nit is pretty certain that Arabic seamen even at that date regularly\r\ntraded as far as the island of Madagascar.\r\n\r\nThe Persian Gulf has been another nursery of a seafaring people\r\nsince long before the record of history begins; yet so slow were\r\nthey to learn of anything outside their capes, that it was accounted\r\na wonderful thing when, in the winter of 325-4 B. C., Nearchus, the\r\nadmiral of the fleet of Alexander the Great, voyaged from the mouth of\r\nthe Indus to the head of the Persian Gulf. Soon afterward, however,\r\nunder the house of the Ptolemies, rulers of Egypt, fleets sailed\r\nregularly between Red Sea ports and India and Ceylon.\r\n\r\nBut now for many long centuries the boundaries of the known world\r\nwere not to be much enlarged (although methods of navigation were\r\nimproved and commerce continued within the limits of Roman and Arabic\r\ndominion), for we know of the discovery of no new coasts until we\r\nbegin to hear of the doings of an independent and far northern people,\r\nscarcely known to the civilized world, and certainly not regarded as a\r\npart of it.\r\n\r\nOn the bleak shores of the North Sea, where the fiords and creek-mouths\r\nof Scandinavia gave shelter not only from foreign enemies, but from\r\neach other, there had grown up a seafaring race of men, of Gothic\r\nancestry, who had settled on the coasts of what are now Norway, Sweden,\r\nand Denmark. They styled themselves Norsemen, or men of the North, and\r\ndid not object to the title Vikings, or Fiord-men; but their enemies\r\ncalled them pirates, and with much reason, for they ravaged and ruled\r\nall the coasts both north and south of the Baltic, voyaging northward\r\nto the “land of the midnight sun,” colonizing northern France in the\r\ntenth century, and taking practical possession of all they pleased of\r\nthe British Isles—Ireland and northern Scotland in particular. Here\r\nthese Norsemen met equally fierce foes, or found congenial partners,\r\nas the case might be, in the Scottish and Irish seamen of that day,\r\nwho were themselves bold freebooters and wide voyagers; and when, in\r\nthe middle of the ninth century, the Northmen had discovered, as they\r\nsupposed, the Faroe Islands and Iceland, a little exploration soon\r\nshowed them that the Irish _culdees_, or priests of the Christian\r\nchurch planted in Ireland by St. Patrick, had been there before\r\nthem—first in 725, according to the Irish chronicles of Dicuilus, who\r\nseems worthy of credence. Indeed, it is believed by some antiquarians\r\nthat these Irish sea-wanderers had colonized Iceland at the same early\r\nage; had reached Newfoundland, and regularly resorted to its banks\r\nfor fishing and whaling (five hundred years before Cabot); and were\r\neven acquainted with the coast of the North American continent, where\r\ntraditions assert that their colonies were planted on what are now the\r\nshores of Virginia and the Carolinas, which they called New Ireland.\r\n\r\nThese are entertaining old stories, and may have some truth in them,\r\nfor it seems certain that the Irish reached Iceland, at least, in the\r\neighth century. Icelandic history, however, begins with the visits\r\nof Norsemen in 850, followed by others, who, a few years later, took\r\ncolonies there and set up an island population which before a century\r\nhad elapsed numbered more than fifty thousand people. They had a\r\nrepublican form of government, and were quite independent of the King\r\nof Norway (Harold the Fair-haired, great-great-grandfather of William\r\nthe Conqueror), from whom the earlier colonists had fled because of his\r\noppression; but they kept up acquaintance with the mother-country, and\r\nmerchants and adventurers were continually voyaging between Iceland\r\nand all the islands and coasts of that region, using stanch vessels\r\nsometimes one hundred feet in length, and eminently seaworthy; yet\r\ntheir only guides were the stars and such signs as seafaring men read\r\nin the water and weather about them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A WAR EXPEDITION OF THE VIKINGS.]\r\n\r\nIt continually happened, however, that they were driven far out of\r\ntheir courses, in such a region of gales, currents, and fogs as is the\r\nNorth Atlantic. In one such adventure, in the year 876, a sea-captain\r\nnamed Gunnbjörn Ulfkragesson was driven far to the west of Iceland,\r\nand when he got back to port told his friends that he had seen land.\r\nProbably he also told them Showing build, steering-oar, and rig\r\n(colored lug-sail), of Scandinavian exploring ships in the North\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\nthat so far as he could see there was nothing but icy mountains, of\r\nwhich they already had enough, for no one seems to have investigated\r\nthe matter further until more than a century later, when a turbulent\r\nviking of the rebellious house of Erik, called Erik the Red, was\r\nbanished from Norway and fled to Iceland with his followers. He was\r\nsoon convicted there also of manslaughter in a neighborhood quarrel,\r\nand again condemned to banishment. Iceland wanted to get rid of him and\r\nhis brawlers, and Europe would not let him return. Whither should he go?\r\n\r\nThen his thoughts turned toward the strange land in the west that\r\ntradition said Gunnbjörn had sighted. It is believed by the most\r\ncareful students that Gunnbjörn’s “rocks” were volcanic islets, which\r\nhave now disappeared, and are represented only by certain shoals;\r\nbut it would not be incredible that he had caught a glimpse of the\r\nGreenland coast itself.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, Erik had little hesitation in starting out to rediscover\r\nthem. Why should he? Those rough-riders of the sea were used to voyages\r\nof equal length. It is about 200 miles from the Norwegian coast at\r\nBergen to the Shetland Islands; 200 miles from the Shetlands, or 225\r\nfrom the Hebrides, to the Faroes; and 275 miles thence to the nearest\r\ncoast of Iceland,—reckoning all in straight lines, shorter than any\r\nship could actually follow.\r\n\r\nIf his viking boat and viking crew could span those stretches of sea\r\nunguided, what hindered his crossing the little further space whose\r\ntempests had no terrors for this wild sea-king? In that unpossessed\r\nland, could he find it, he might be free to riot at his will (but one\r\ncannot help thinking there was more in the man than that!); and if he\r\ncould open to his people a new country, what wealth and power might not\r\ncome with it to him, for the humbling of his rivals at the court of\r\nNorway.\r\n\r\nSo Red Erik sailed away to the west in 984, and two years later\r\nreturned to Iceland and reported that he had met first a far-extending\r\nicy coast, along whose front he had sailed southward until he could\r\nturn to the west and then northward, thus rounding its narrow southern\r\nextremity (Cape Farewell); and there he had found a habitable region,\r\nwhich he called Greenland, in order, as he said, to attract settlers\r\nby a pleasant name. Thus this wicked old Norseman was the first of\r\nAmerican “real-estate boomers.”\r\n\r\nAttracted by his story, a band of adventurers went back with him in\r\n986, and established a settlement near the site of the present Danish\r\ntown Julianshaab, just inside the cape, on an inlet that they named\r\nEriksfiord.\r\n\r\nAmong these emigrants was one named Herjulf, whose son Bjarne[2] was a\r\nmerchant captain who owned his own ship, and was then absent in Norway.\r\nReturning to Iceland shortly after Erik’s departure, he concluded at\r\nonce to follow his father, and, with a willing crew and still loaded\r\nship, set sail for the west. But incessant bad weather drove them they\r\nknew not whither during many days. At last the wind fell, the sun shone\r\nout, and they saw land; but its appearance did not agree with the\r\ndescription of Greenland, and knowing they were too far south, Bjarne\r\nturned north, and kept on, occasionally sighting the coast, until\r\nfinally he reached Eriksfiord in safety. No one knows what headlands\r\nhe looked upon; but if the Icelandic versified chronicles called sagas\r\nmay be believed,—and the wisest students of history put faith in\r\nthem,—he was the first European to see America of whom we have definite\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nSeveral years passed by, however, before any one tried to profit by\r\nthis accident and seek the lands that had been seen southward. Then\r\nLeif, the eldest son of old Red Erik, resolved to do so. He had talked\r\nwith Bjarne and his men until he knew all the details of their story,\r\nand then he bought the same good old ship, and enlisted a crew of\r\nthirty-five men. This happened in Norway, where Leif then was, and it\r\nis said by some that the king aided and authorized the expedition. At\r\nany rate, after a public farewell they sailed away, and seem to have\r\ngone straight across the ocean; but whether they did this, or sailed\r\nby way of Iceland and Greenland, they easily found the unknown coasts\r\nBjarne had described, and landed in Helluland, Markland, and Vinland,\r\nin the last of which they built huts and spent the winter of the year\r\n1000.\r\n\r\nThe identification of these places has caused much discussion. That\r\n“Helluland” was Newfoundland and “Markland” Nova Scotia seems tolerably\r\ncertain; but historians are not agreed as to where that winter was\r\nspent in “Vinland,” so called (meaning “Wineland”) because a German\r\nmember of the crew gathered grapes there, from which wine could be\r\nmade. When, in 1602, Gosnold discovered a fruitful island south of Cape\r\nCod, he named it Martha’s Vineyard, believing that he had found the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nWhen Leif reached Greenland again, the next spring, every one was\r\nvastly interested in his discoveries, and emigrants from Greenland,\r\nIceland, and even from Europe went out to colonize the new lands; but\r\nthe attempts, though spasmodically continued for a long time, seem\r\nnever to have been really successful, so that no undisputed trace of\r\nthe presence of these sea-wanderers on the mainland of North America\r\nis known to exist. That they knew the coast fairly well from Disco\r\nIsland (70° N. lat.) southward to Virginia, is generally believed;\r\nbut where Leif Erikson spent that first winter, or where the Vinland\r\nsettlement of subsequent times was, is thus far a matter of conjecture.\r\nSome students of the sagas place it in New York harbor, others in\r\nNarragansett or Buzzard’s bay, near Boston, or in Nova Scotia. Formerly\r\nthe general belief was that Newport, R. I., or the shore above there,\r\nwas surely the site; but this was based, first, on the supposed\r\nEuropean inscriptions on a rock in the Somerset River, at Dighton,\r\njust above Fall River, which were in reality only Indian markings;\r\nand, second, upon the “old round tower” at Newport, which few persons\r\nnow believe was built prior to the coming of the English colonists\r\nwith Roger Williams. The late Professor E. H. Horsford believed that\r\nhe had found the site of the principal Norse settlement of the tenth\r\ncentury, called Norumbega, at Watertown, on the Charles River, a few\r\nmiles west of Boston; and he made an argument from old maps, etc., to\r\nsupport his assertion that the ancient river-walls, etc., there were\r\nreally the remains of a town; but historians generally do not attach\r\nany importance to Professor Horsford’s theory.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we shall never know where this “Vinland” was that Leif\r\ndiscovered, and where the queenly Gudrid dwelt and her son Schnorr—the\r\nfirst white child in America—was born; nor is it of much consequence\r\nthat we should, for the settlements were few and transitory. That they\r\nexisted, however, and that the shores of Canada and New England were\r\noccasionally visited from the tenth to the fourteenth centuries by\r\nNorsemen, cannot be gainsaid. That the Greenlanders did not all migrate\r\nto the warmer, well-timbered, and fruitful region in the south was\r\nprobably due to the fact that it was so remote from their kindred, and\r\nso open to attack by the native red men, whom they called _skrellings_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A VIKING GALLEY.]\r\n\r\nOver the long but slow history of these American settlements of\r\nthe Northmen we need not linger. Although Vinland seems to have\r\nbeen abandoned within a few decades, the Greenland settlements were\r\nmaintained. A republican government was organized; Christianity was\r\nintroduced, and remains of their stone churches and Augustinian\r\nmonasteries have been identified. By the end of the fifteenth century,\r\nhowever, these colonies had completely disappeared, worn out in\r\nthe hopeless struggle against climate and the savage Eskimos, but\r\nexterminated, at last, perhaps, by the Black Death—for the great plague\r\nwhich almost depopulated Europe in the fourteenth century seems to have\r\nreached even the desolate shores of Greenland, and to have consumed the\r\nlast of these remote people, causing them to be utterly forgotten.\r\n\r\nA more definite account of pre-Columbian North America than that of\r\nthe sagas and other traditions of the Vinlanders, and one accepted as\r\ntrue by Mr. Major of the English Hakluyt Society and other competent\r\ngeographical critics, is that of the voyages and reports of the\r\nbrothers Nicolò and Antonio Zeno. These men belonged to a family\r\ndistinguished in Venice; and toward the close of the fourteenth century\r\nthey separately or together made many voyages in the North Atlantic,\r\ngoing far beyond any previous navigators of which they knew. They wrote\r\nletters home containing an account of these, but little publication was\r\ngiven to them, and they were forgotten until the revival of interest in\r\ngeography following the early discoveries of Columbus. The documents\r\npossessed by the Zeno family were then made the basis of a pamphlet\r\nby a grand-nephew reciting what his ancestor had done, long before\r\nthe time of Columbus. The most interesting thing in it is an account\r\nof how, about 1390, Nicolò Zeno fitted out a ship at the Faroes, went\r\nover to Greenland and there learned of an island which was called\r\nEstotiland, and which we know as Newfoundland. Not very far away to the\r\nsouthwest of it, he says, was the country of Drogeo, which fishermen\r\nwhom he saw had visited. They claimed to have “discovered” none of\r\nthese places, but spoke of them as formerly well known, although then\r\nlittle frequented by Europeans.\r\n\r\nAs to Drogeo,—which he speaks of as if it were the mainland,—that\r\nwas still occasionally resorted to for fishing; and he relates the\r\nadventures of a white man who had been captured by the mainland savages\r\na few years previously, and adopted by them on account of his knowledge\r\nof how to fish with a net, and to do other useful things. Such a\r\ncourse would be very characteristic of the aborigines of eastern North\r\nAmerica, as we have since learned to know; and it is also natural that\r\nhe should have been fought for by rival chiefs, as Zeno says happened\r\nto this man, who, by capture and exchange, or of his own motion,\r\ntraveled about and saw much of the people of this “country” Drogeo. At\r\nany rate, the information given by Zeno tallies remarkably well with\r\nthe truth about primitive North America and its inhabitants. “They have\r\nno kind of metal,” reported this wandering refugee, who finally drifted\r\nback to the coast, and was able to make his escape to a fishing-boat.\r\nNow the one really remarkable and distinctive fact about the North\r\nAmericans was just this,—that with a considerable advance in other\r\ndirections, they had never learned to fuse and forge or otherwise\r\nutilize iron or other metals, save a little metallic copper and silver\r\nin the Great Lakes region. But listen to the rest of his brief report:\r\n\r\n  They live by hunting, and carry lances of wood sharpened at the\r\n  point. They have bows, the strings of which are made of beasts’\r\n  skins. They are very fierce, and have deadly fights amongst each\r\n  other, and eat one another’s flesh [as was true, to a limited\r\n  ceremonial extent, after battles]. They have chieftains and certain\r\n  laws among themselves, but differing in the different tribes. The\r\n  farther you go southwestward, however, the more refinement you meet\r\n  with, because the climate is more temperate, and, accordingly, there\r\n  [_i. e._, in Mexico] they have cities and temples dedicated to their\r\n  idols, in which they sacrifice men and afterwards eat them. In those\r\n  parts they have some knowledge of gold and silver.\r\n\r\nNow, whether all this was the observation of a single rude sailor,\r\nor, as is more likely, summarizes what Zeno was able to learn from\r\nall sources at his command regarding the new western mainland and its\r\npeople, it is correct and forcible. Had young Nicolò the editor, a\r\ncentury afterward, tried to invent something of the kind, he would\r\nsurely have made his invention marvelous, for that was an age of fable\r\nand bombast. On the contrary, this is a simple and accurate statement\r\nof what we now know were the facts. Nor did he have any means of\r\nknowing anything more of the case than his family archives revealed,\r\nsince he wrote and published this account of his uncle’s voyages only a\r\nfew years after the first return of Columbus, and before any writer had\r\nvisited the northern American coasts, or had learned the habits of the\r\nnatives. I can but believe, therefore, that the report was made in good\r\nfaith, and records simply what the Zeni did and saw and heard; and that\r\nthese bold Venetian navigators knew more about North America, at least,\r\nbefore the end of the fourteenth century than Columbus had learned by\r\nthe end of the fifteenth.\r\n\r\nI have run ahead of my story, but I wanted to show how little\r\nimpression these northern investigations and occupation of a new\r\ncontinent had made upon the Mediterranean “world,” which seems rarely\r\nto have heard of them, much less to have profited by the information,\r\nfor more than four hundred years, in spite of the fact that there was\r\nconstant communication between the Normans and British, at least, and\r\nthe Mediterranean peoples.\r\n\r\nLet us now go back to those southern countries and see what they had\r\nbeen doing toward maritime exploration during these thousand years\r\nand more when the Scandinavians were so busy in the north. It was\r\nprincipally perfecting the knowledge of the world their fathers knew.\r\nFrom the very first men had tried to make maps, and succeeded fairly\r\nwell for small spaces; but to make a map of the whole world was a task\r\nthat defied human knowledge for many centuries. After Aristotle’s time\r\nall men of education understood that the world was a sphere; and about\r\n150 B. C. Hipparchus, borrowing an idea from the Babylonians, taught\r\nthe Greeks that the way to place their towns and mountains and rivers\r\nand the outlines of the coast correctly upon a model of the world, was\r\nto determine their position by observations of the heavenly bodies.\r\nThus the ideas of latitude and longitude originated. He could not apply\r\nhis method practically very far, because there were few or no accurate\r\nastronomical observations away from a few cities in Egypt and Greece;\r\nbut two hundred and fifty years later Ptolemy, a learned mathematician\r\nof Alexandria, gathered all the facts obtainable, and made an attempt\r\nwhich bore a rude resemblance to the truth and served as the best and\r\nalmost the only account of the world for several hundred years. Ptolemy\r\nflourished about 150 A. D. His book describes Asia as far east as the\r\nMalayan peninsula, Africa south to Zanzibar and the Gulf of Guinea,\r\nand shows a knowledge of Europe as far north as the Shetland Islands\r\n(Ultima Thule) and Denmark; the original work seems to have contained\r\nno maps, but these were added to it about 500 A. D. by another\r\nmathematician named Agathodæmon. It is called the Almagest.\r\n\r\nNothing of value was added to this during the long stagnant period of\r\nthe world called the middle ages, when the love of learning declined\r\nand men fell back into the old traditions, even to the extent of being\r\ntaught by their priests that it was a sin to believe that the world\r\nwas round. In those times the Arabs of Bagdad nourished knowledge more\r\nthan any one else, but even they did little for geography. Finally the\r\npeople of Europe began to wake up and look at things for themselves,\r\ninstead of tamely accepting whatever the Pope of Rome or somebody else\r\ntold them, and going and coming as he directed, regardless of whether\r\nit was for their interest to do so or not. One of the first and one of\r\nthe most important influences of this revival in a desire for learning\r\nand the means for larger activity among men was the sudden extension of\r\nnavigation; and this could not have come about, nor amounted to much,\r\nhad the mariner’s compass not been invented.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  “Off, thou Norseland Terror, clouding\r\n      Hellas with the jealous wraith\r\n\r\n  Which, the gods of old enshrouding,\r\n      Froze their hearts, the poet saith!”\r\n]\r\n\r\nNothing is more obscure than the history of this instrument. The\r\nChinese have certainly known, from a remote antiquity, that a\r\nmagnetized needle, permitted to move freely, would turn north and\r\nsouth; but they seem to have profited as little by it as by so many\r\nother useful things that, long afterward, in the hands of the more\r\nenergetic men of the West, contributed so largely to the progress of\r\ncivilization. They were accustomed to poise a sliver of magnetized\r\nsteel upon a bit of cork and set it afloat in a bowl of water. One end\r\nwas marked, but this, with characteristic Chinese perversity, was the\r\none pointing toward the south, not toward the north, as with us. This\r\nrude and simple arrangement is still in use among the Koreans—or was\r\nuntil recently. With such a contrivance and little, it any, knowledge\r\nof the variation of the needle, the Chinese of a thousand years ago\r\nmade longer voyages than they have done in more modern times, trading\r\nnot only with India, but sailing regularly as early at least as the\r\nninth century to the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\nThere is no direct evidence, but it seems incontestable, that it was\r\nfrom these eastern mariners that the Arabs received the compass, and\r\ngradually brought it into use in their home waters, where it became\r\nwell known to the crusaders and other sea-going travelers of the middle\r\nages. Little reliance could be placed upon it, however, until the\r\nsixteenth century, when the need for something trustworthy for long\r\nvoyages made men turn their attention to the study and betterment of it.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the fourteenth century, as I have said, Europe was\r\nbeginning to recover from the terrible visitations of the plague, and\r\nto wake from its lethargy and to look abroad; and various influences\r\nwere at work to promote exploration by sea and land—and what a grand\r\nfield for study there was!\r\n\r\nAt this time nearly all the commerce of Europe, mainly in Italian\r\nhands, was with India and China. The overland route was long, perilous,\r\nand expensive, and that across the Arabian Gulf hardly less so. At\r\nbest, such traffic was slow and limited, and the first need of the\r\nreviving world was the discovery of some straighter and quicker road\r\nto the East. In this quest Portugal came forward under the brilliant\r\nleadership of Dom Henrique (Prince Henry), styled “the Navigator,” who\r\nwas the younger son of King João (or John) I, and half an Englishman,\r\nsince his mother was Philippa of Lancaster. It was Prince Henry’s\r\nambition to extend geographical discovery and improve seamanship, and\r\nhe enlisted the help of the best navigators obtainable, regardless of\r\nnationality. In order to observe the heavens to better advantage, and\r\nalso to study the tides and other nautical phenomena, he established an\r\nobservatory on the bleak headland of Cape Sagres, where he willingly\r\nspent a large portion of his time for the sake of science. Navigation\r\nwas sorely in need of such help. Except that they had rude compasses,\r\nof whose laws of variation, etc., they were ignorant, the seamen\r\nof that day were little, if any, better equipped than were those\r\nwho sailed the “ships of Tarshish” a thousand years before that.\r\nAstronomers had supplied them with rough tables of the declination of\r\nthe sun, pole-star, etc., by which, with the help of a cross-staff,—a\r\nsimple instrument for ascertaining angles,—they might make a guess at\r\nthe latitude. Longitude was found only by observations of eclipses of\r\nthe moon, and noting the difference between the time when it was due\r\nat home, according to the almanac, and the local time of its actual\r\ncoming; but at sea the “observations” were little better than guessing.\r\n\r\nChart-making was an important branch of study at Sagres. So few and\r\nrare were sea-maps then that one was never seen in England until 1489.\r\nTo the collection of information in this direction, and the improvement\r\nof nautical methods, Prince Henry and his aids applied themselves most\r\ndiligently; but he died before much had been accomplished. Nautical\r\nstudies went on, however, under the next king, John II, for whom Martin\r\nof Bohemia, the foremost astronomer of his time, devised a form of the\r\nastrolabe for use on shipboard, increasing accuracy in finding latitude.\r\n\r\nIt was with no better instruments than these (and sand-glasses in\r\nplace of chronometers) as guides over chartless and unsounded seas\r\nthat the way was found to India and to America, and the globe was\r\ncircumnavigated; and that the same thing might be done again is shown\r\nby the fact that only last year (1897) a vessel, which had barely\r\nescaped destruction in a storm and lost all her instruments in the\r\nmid-Pacific, was brought safely into San Francisco by observation of\r\nthe stars and “dead-reckoning” alone.\r\n\r\nBut Prince Henry (for I have run ahead of my story again) was not\r\ncontent to study and teach on land alone. He was fired with the ardor\r\nof discovery and conquest likely to augment Portugal’s wealth and\r\ninfluence in the East. Expedition after expedition was sent southward,\r\nand in 1435 Henry’s ships finally passed Cape Bojador. Great was the\r\nwonder and rejoicing thereat, for it had always been taught by the\r\nmonks that this cape was the end of the earth; but it was not until\r\n1462 that the Cape Verd Islands and Sierra Leone were reached. Prince\r\nHenry had been dead since 1460, but the influence of his wise and\r\nuntiring enthusiasm and work lived on, and inspired the king and people\r\nof Portugal to renewed efforts at solving that riddle of Africa that\r\nperhaps the Egyptian sphinx was meant to typify. By 1469 trade had been\r\nopened with the Gold Coast, and a few years later the mouth of the\r\nCongo was found.\r\n\r\nThese advances showed that there was nothing unnatural or fearful in\r\nthe southern latitudes, as sailors had been taught to believe from\r\ntime immemorial,—a superstitious dread which the old chart-makers long\r\nsustained by their habit of filling the empty sea-spaces on their maps\r\nwith fearsome and wondrous monsters,—and therefore, in 1486, King John\r\nII sent Bartholomew Dias in two sail-boats—pinnaces of fifty tons\r\neach—with orders to go as far as he could; and this bold captain,\r\npassing the last known headland of the Guinea coast, sailed on and on,\r\ntracing the West African coast, and landing here and there to examine\r\nthe swampy shores, to get fresh water, and to hoist the castellated\r\nbanner of Portugal in token of possession before the wondering eyes of\r\nnaked negroes. At length he was blown and buffeted for days and days in\r\nheavy storms, and at their close found himself far to the eastward of\r\nhis former longitude, whereupon he fought his way on and sighted land\r\nwhich he rightly determined must be the southern extremity of Africa.\r\nThis was in 1487. Returning to Lisbon toward Christmas of that year, he\r\nreported his experiences, and dwelling especially upon the rough time\r\nhe had had in the south, proposed to style the point of the continent\r\nCape of all the Storms; but King John, foreseeing great things to\r\nfollow for his country, said, “No; we will call it the Cape of Good\r\nHope”; and so it remains to this day—but all the storms remain about\r\nit, too!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTION OF A FIFTEENTH CENTURY SEA-CHART, BY TOSCANELLI.\r\n\r\nCopied by permission of Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co., from Justin\r\nWinsor’s “Narrative and Critical History of America.”]\r\n\r\nNow for some years previous to this time the monarchs of western\r\nEurope were much exercised over rumors of the existence somewhere\r\nin the Orient of an all-powerful and generally marvelous potentate\r\nstyled (by them) Prester John, and reputed to be a conqueror of\r\nAsiatic, or perhaps African, infidels who later had become cut off\r\nfrom Christendom. The whole affair was a myth, probably arising from\r\nan indistinct knowledge of Abyssinia, whose negus afterward borrowed\r\nthe title; but before this was realized popes and various “Catholic\r\nmajesties” had sent embassies in search of Prester John’s court, some\r\nof which incidentally gained valuable information. Among the latter\r\nwas Pedro Covilho, an emissary of Portugal, who, having failed to find\r\nPrester John in western India or Persia, made his way back to Egypt and\r\nAbyssinia, whence he sent home in 1486 or 1487 a report of progress\r\nthat told John II some surprising news of the advancement of the Arabs\r\nof that part of the world in the sciences, and especially in those\r\nbelonging to geography and navigation.\r\n\r\nCovilho’s messenger was a Portuguese Jew, Rabbi Joseph of Lamego, who\r\ncarried voluminous letters, one of which showed that Arabic mariners\r\nwere then familiar with the whole length of the east coast of Africa,\r\nincluding Madagascar, and were perfectly well aware where it terminated\r\nat the south, and that there was no obstacle to passing around to the\r\nwestern side of the continent; and just at this interesting juncture\r\nDias came sailing back in his pinnace to say that it was all true, for\r\nhe had seen it.\r\n\r\nThus the sea-road was open to India and Cathay, and Portugal was eager\r\nto take advantage of it. She was then one of the leading powers of\r\nEurope, and the foremost one in colonial and commercial enterprise,\r\nstriving to wrest from Genoa and Venice the supremacy in trade that\r\nthey had so long enjoyed. Nevertheless almost ten years elapsed\r\nbefore the next expedition was sent southward to confirm Portugal’s\r\npossessions, and establish commerce with the Orient. John II had died,\r\nand Emmanuel the Fortunate reigned in his stead—a reign that has been\r\ncalled the heroic period of the nation’s history; and it must not be\r\nforgotten that “Little Portugal” was then so mighty that a year or so\r\npreviously (May 4, 1493) the Pope (Alexander VI) had issued a bull in\r\nwhich he had divided, with intended equality, all undiscovered parts of\r\nthe earth between Spain and Portugal, the former being given everything\r\nto the west, while to Portugal were reserved all future rights east of\r\na certain north-and-south line.\r\n\r\nThe line of separation designated was the meridian of no variation of\r\nthe compass-needle. The existence of such a line had been discovered\r\nby the same Christopher Columbus who was to thrill the world a few\r\nyears later; but he did not know, what only experience developed, that\r\nthis meridian was changeable, swinging many degrees east and then\r\nreturning west in the course of two or three centuries. At that time\r\nthe line seemed fixed some three hundred miles west of the Azores, and\r\nphilosophers accounted for it later by a theory that it lay in the\r\nmiddle of the Atlantic because there it was subject to an equality\r\nof attraction toward both continents which held it steady. This was\r\nnot true, but it was better than the less learned but more popular\r\nexplanation of the magnetism of the compass—namely, that it was “an\r\neffluvium from the root of the tail of the Little Bear.” A year later,\r\nhowever (June 7, 1494), the treaty of Tordesillas, between Spain and\r\nPortugal, declared that the line of demarcation should be the meridian\r\n370 leagues west of the Cape Verd Islands, or as nearly as possible\r\nin the center of the Atlantic. The supposition that there might be\r\nvaluable lands within, that is, east of, that limit, inspired several\r\nof Portugal’s subsequent searchers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DRAWN BY HENRY B. SNELL.\r\n\r\n“THE SEA-ROAD TO INDIA AND CATHAY.”]\r\n\r\nIn 1497 King Emmanuel’s expedition was ready to sail—the largest and\r\nbest equipped, probably, that had ever been sent out by any government,\r\nand its commander was Vasco da Gama, a young naval officer of renown.\r\nHis fleet consisted of four vessels,—small caravels, of course, one\r\nof which was commanded by Dias,—and left the Tagus, after ceremonious\r\nfarewells, in July. Da Gama stopped at various places, but reached\r\nand safely rounded the stormy cape in November. He had with him the\r\ninformation (and some say an Arabic map) sent home by Covilho, but his\r\nbusiness was not to verify this, but to reach India and establish new\r\nPortuguese possessions. Why, then, did he not strike straight across\r\nfrom Cape Agulhas, as East Indiamen have done ever since? For the good\r\nreason that he had no guide, no means of finding his way across the\r\nsouthern ocean, where all the stars were strange; for sun observations\r\nfor latitude were then unknown to European navigators, and rarely used\r\non land. Instead of this, he was obliged to turn northward and skirt\r\nthe coast for a thousand miles, stopping here and there, until he had\r\npassed far enough north of the equator to bring above the horizon the\r\nfamiliar home stars, for which he had “tables.”\r\n\r\nAt last, from the Arab port of Melindi, near Mombasa, he turned east\r\nand sailed straight away to India, where he anchored before Calicut,\r\nthen the most important port of southern India, on May 20. Returning\r\nthe next year with ships richly laden, he was received with public\r\nrejoicings and given high honors; and he greatly astonished his\r\nfriends of the navy by telling them that the Arabs used the compass,\r\nsea-charts, quadrants, and “had divers maritime mysteries not short of\r\nthe Portugals.”\r\n\r\nDa Gama lived many years, and sailed often to India and China after\r\nthat; but chiefly on political expeditions, in which he disgraced his\r\notherwise great name by inexcusable rapine and cruelty.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile some exploration had been done toward the far north, as we\r\nshall see in the next chapter; and so the fifteenth century ended, with\r\nEurope understood as far as Nova Zembla, Africa circumnavigated, and\r\nthe coasts of India, Malaya, southern China, and the larger Malayan\r\nislands fairly familiar to geographers. This is much, and yet it leaves\r\nunmentioned the greatest fact of all—the work of that grand, sad\r\ncharacter, Christopher Columbus, upon whose grave near Seville has been\r\nwritten:\r\n\r\n  HE GAVE A NEW WORLD TO SPAIN.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ENGRAVED BY E. H. DEL’ORME.\r\n\r\nTHE FLYING DUTCHMAN.\r\n\r\n“There, beyond the Cape of Storms, Where the breaker’s voice of thunder\r\nRoars when ships are rent asunder, Through a fog of ghostly forms\r\n\r\n“Men catch glimpses of the sail, Ages old, and rent and hoary, Of that\r\nquaint old ship of story, And cry, ‘Vanderdecken, hail!’”]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ROCK IN THE SEA.]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] This is related by the Greek historian Herodotus, and has often\r\nbeen denied, especially by the older writers; but the “Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica” gives it credence, and tells us that the latest and best\r\ncritic of the geography of Herodotus, Major Rennel, maintains the\r\npossibility of such a voyage, and believes it was made. He argues that\r\nthe construction of their ships, with flat bottoms and low masts,\r\nenabled these hardy voyagers to keep close to the land, and to enter\r\nall the rivers and harbors for food and water. I think, therefore, that\r\nwe may believe that Herodotus recorded what really happened, even if we\r\nreject some details.\r\n\r\n[2] This is not a Norse, but an Irish name, familiar to us as _Barney_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n(_Continued_)\r\n\r\nEARLY VOYAGES AND EXPLORATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II—FROM COLUMBUS TO COOK\r\n\r\nWhy to Spain? It is an “oft-told tale,” and the merest reminder is all\r\nthat is needed here. Columbus was a young seafaring man, born at Genoa\r\nabout 1434, and ambitious to become a master of his profession, and\r\nespecially to acquire great wealth. He traveled to Venice, Barcelona,\r\nand other cities where learning was to be gained, and became thoroughly\r\nacquainted with all the astronomical and geographical science of the\r\ntime, and especially proficient in the art of cartography. Attracted by\r\nthe naval activity in Portugal under that indefatigable Prince Henry,\r\nColumbus went to Lisbon about 1454, and endeavored to find a leading\r\nplace in the sea-work that country was doing. But Portugal’s eyes were\r\nso blinded by the glamour of Africa and the East Indies that she had\r\nno time to follow the gaze of this young and ardent Genoese captain\r\nwhose eyes were turned steadily toward the west, where, more and more\r\ninsistently, he urged that a sea-track, straight as a line of latitude\r\nmarked on a globe, lay open to the Indies and the coasts of Cathay. To\r\nprove this true would be not only a glorious exploit for any man, but\r\nan achievement of untold advantage to the nation under whose flag he\r\nsailed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTRAIT-STATUE OF COLUMBUS IN MADRID.]\r\n\r\nJust how this conviction arose in the mind of Columbus we do not know.\r\nIt was probably first a purely scientific conclusion from the facts of\r\nastronomy and geography that he had learned, encouraged by romantic\r\ntraditions of western “Isles of the Blest.” A few scientific men agreed\r\nwith him, but the great influence of the Church of Rome condemned such\r\nnotions as opposed to the Bible and revealed religion; and the mass of\r\nthe people, ignorant and superstitious, looked upon them as foolish,\r\nand laughed at Columbus as a\r\n\r\n\r\ndreamer or worse. Between his danger of arrest and death as a heretic\r\non the one hand, and imprisonment as a lunatic on the other, the man\r\nof science in those days had a hard time. Columbus therefore sought\r\nfar and wide for evidence to support his theories and render them\r\nacceptable. How much he learned—what, in the way of facts, he actually\r\nknew—it is hard to say. Having fallen in love with a Portuguese lady of\r\ngood family, he married and apparently settled in Portugal as his home,\r\nbut continued his voyaging. He knew the Mediterranean from end to end.\r\nHe made several voyages to the Guinea coast, and dwelt for a time at El\r\nMina, then newly founded, satisfying himself of the foolishness of the\r\ncommon assertion that men could not live “under the equinoctial”—that\r\nis, near the equator. He went north to and beyond Iceland, and\r\nacquainted himself with those waters, and thus convinced himself that\r\nthe ocean was everywhere navigable, and subject to uniform laws of\r\ntides, weather, etc. His mind was cleared more and more of the mists of\r\nfable and superstition, and all he learned brought into clearer view\r\nthe truth of science as a guide. He devoted more and more attention to\r\nimproving the means of finding the true position of a vessel at sea,\r\nand of keeping a true course by the compass, which he continually\r\nstudied; and it was he who first discovered that some leagues west of\r\nthe Azores lay the meridian of no variation—a meridian that has now\r\nmoved eastward until it lies near London. Everywhere he interrogated\r\nexplorers, discussed navigation with experienced captains, and sought\r\nthe aid of new maps, improved instruments, and advancing knowledge; and\r\nyet mixed with all seem to have been a childlike vanity, credulity, and\r\nsuperstition, hard to reconcile with his courage and acumen.\r\n\r\nHow much actual evidence he had of the existence of lands below the\r\nAtlantic horizon unknown to his countrymen can never probably be\r\nsatisfactorily answered. The latest critical biographer of Columbus,\r\nthe great Spanish liberal statesman Emilio Castelar, considers that\r\nhe was led to his discoveries by little, if anything, outside of\r\npure reasoning upon the rotundity of the earth and other scientific\r\ndata, and dismisses as fables or things unknown to Columbus all\r\nthe Scandinavian discoveries of Greenland and the rest, and other\r\nstories of men who, it is said, had already seen the transatlantic\r\nworld he sought. We are told that he learned of woods and canes like\r\nnone that grew in Africa, of strange carvings, and even of the dead\r\nbodies of men, resembling those of the far East, being cast upon the\r\nshores of Africa and the islands near it, especially the Azores. It\r\nseems impossible that when he was in Iceland and the other northern\r\nregions, a man of his inquiring mind should not have learned something\r\nof Greenland and the continental shores beyond, especially when one\r\nremembers that for centuries previous Catholic missionaries had been\r\nreporting progress to Rome from that distant but real field of labor.\r\nIt is quite likely that some knowledge of these facts, which must\r\nhave been known to the professors of the universities of Pavia and\r\nBarcelona, where Columbus studied, and to other intelligent men of\r\nItaly and Spain with whom he came in contact, had caused Columbus to go\r\nto the north, for we know of no other errand. Perhaps he had heard of\r\nthe Zeni.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ships of columbus]\r\n\r\nEspecially to be noted is the allegation that Columbus possessed\r\ninformation as to the experience of a Frenchman named Jean Cousin,—a\r\nDieppe sea-captain, who, it is asserted, discovered South America\r\nand the Amazon River in 1488. This claim has been lately reviewed\r\n(“Fortnightly Review,” January, 1894) by Captain Gambier of the British\r\nnavy, and he decides that it is good; and that it was because Cousin’s\r\nfirst mate was one of the Pinçons that that firm was willing to assist\r\nColumbus, as a good investment.\r\n\r\nWhatever he knew or did not know, and whatever may have been the\r\ndifficulties in his way, Columbus spent many weary years in fruitless\r\nefforts to interest some government in his schemes. How finally he won\r\nSpain to his support, secured the aid of the Pinçons, merchant princes\r\nof Palos, and sailed from that port on August 3, 1492,—and it was\r\nFriday!—are details that need not be repeated. Equally well remembered\r\nare the story of his daring onward voyage, and of the glorious outcome\r\nwhen, on October 12, land was seen,—a new world found.\r\n\r\nExpedition after expedition followed one another from Spain to the\r\nnewly found possessions, some conducted by the earlier companions of\r\nColumbus, and all filled with adventurers who cared for nothing but\r\nplunder. One of these, led by an officer named Ojeda, reached the coast\r\nof Guiana in 1499, and coasted along the north shore of South America\r\nas far, probably, as Maracaibo. This was the first of the Spanish\r\nexpeditions actually to set foot upon the mainland; and it would\r\nnot have been mentioned out of its place (since Cabot, as we shall\r\npresently see, had landed on the continent nearly two years before) but\r\nfor the fact that one of its members was that Amerigo Vespucci whose\r\nfortune it was to have his name attached to the continent.\r\n\r\nAmerigo Vespucci (or Vespusze, as Columbus spells it) was a Florentine\r\nengaged in the shipping business who was attracted to Spain by the\r\nmaritime activity there, and became interested in equipping the\r\nsecond flotilla of Columbus and in other similar enterprises for the\r\ngovernment. The wealth and influence thus gained and his general\r\nabilities led him to join that expedition of Ojeda in 1499, and\r\nduring the next four years he made three other voyages to Brazil, in\r\nwhich the bay of Rio Janeiro was entered (New Year’s day, 1501), and\r\nan exploration southward extended probably as far as South Georgia\r\n(Islands). Upon his return from this last voyage, in 1505, he publicly\r\nasserted that he had visited, in 1497, the coast of what is now the\r\nsouthern United States. It has lately been shown by Spanish records,\r\nhowever, that at that date he was busy in the government dockyards\r\nin Spain; therefore his assertion was false. It served, however, to\r\ndeceive a forgetful public, and to procure for its author the coveted\r\nglory of being the first “discoverer” of the “New World,” as he first\r\ncalled it (though there is no evidence that he understood it to be a\r\ncontinent), and hence the one entitled to give it his name.\r\n\r\nThis bold claim achieved its purpose. The oldest known map of the whole\r\nworld, dated A. D. 1500, said to have been drawn by the great artist\r\nLeonardo da Vinci, from data furnished by Juan de la Cosa, and hence\r\nknown to historians as the “De la Cosa Mappimundi” (it is preserved\r\nin Madrid), bears the name “America” across the new countries for the\r\nfirst known time; but Juan de la Cosa was with Ojeda and Vespucci on\r\nthe expedition of 1499, and doubtless Vespucci managed the naming.\r\nIn 1507, only a year after the death of Columbus, there appeared in\r\nFrance the “Cosmographie Introductio” of Waldseemüller (also called\r\nHylacomylus), which was regarded as the most complete and authentic\r\ngeography of its time; and here the name of _America_ was boldly\r\nwritten across “a fourth part of the world, since Amerigo found it.”\r\nThe name (a Latin derivative) was novel, easy to pronounce, no one knew\r\nor cared as to the right of it, and so it stood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “SANTA MARIA”—THE FLAGSHIP OF COLUMBUS’ FLEET.]\r\n\r\nA few lines more as to the Spanish and Portuguese navigators in these\r\nwaters, and then we shall have done with them for the present. In\r\n1499 one of the Pinçons sailed from Spain straight to the Amazon, as\r\nhas been mentioned, avoiding the West Indies, as if he knew precisely\r\nwhither he was bound, and reached there in January of 1500. A few\r\nmonths later a large Portuguese expedition under Pedro Cabral, starting\r\nfor India around the cape, was blown so far to the west that it ran\r\nagainst Brazil. Everybody was hitting upon untrodden shores in those\r\ninspiring days, and Cabral promptly took possession for his king.\r\nAs this shore was outside (east of) the hemisphere assigned by the\r\nPope to the Spanish, the Portuguese kept it for 389 years, in spite\r\nof Pinçon’s priority. In 1508 Ojeda obtained the government of the\r\nnorthern coast of South America, and Nicuesa of the region north of the\r\nGulf of Darien; and with the arrival of these adventurers in New Spain\r\nbegan that era of rapine and horror which will forever disgrace the\r\nSpanish name. The rapacious governors and their wild crews quarreled\r\nand fought with each other as well as with the downtrodden natives,\r\nand exploration was carried on by piracy. A learned man, Martin\r\nEnciso, went out to take command in 1510, but he was deposed by his\r\nsoldiers the next year and sent back to Europe, where he made the\r\nfirst book printed in Spanish (1519) describing America. His place was\r\ntaken by Vasco Nuñez Balboa, who entered upon a career of exploration\r\nand peaceful conquest, generally conciliating the Indians, who told\r\nhim of another sea not far to the west, and on September 25, 1513,\r\nguided him to the summit of a hill near Panama, whence he, first of\r\nEuropeans, gazed upon the Pacific. Who can imagine the emotions of such\r\na sight!—for it told the Spaniards that this land was not the eastern\r\nmargin of Asia, but a new continent. Balboa made his way through the\r\nforests as rapidly as he could, and on the 29th, wading into the surf,\r\nbanner in hand, took possession of the waters in the name of the King\r\nof Castile.\r\n\r\nBalboa at once began preparations to utilize his discovery, for the\r\nIndians had also excited him and his men by tales of a country to the\r\nsouth abounding in gold. He cut and shaped timbers for small ships,\r\nand had with enormous trouble and labor transported these across the\r\nisthmus, intending there to build a fleet and sail southward, when\r\nhe was superseded in command by a new governor, Pedrarias. This man,\r\na jealous and brutal adventurer, on a false pretext of disloyalty\r\narrested and beheaded Balboa before he could get away—an act that\r\n“was one of the greatest calamities that could have happened to South\r\nAmerica at that time; for ... a humane and judicious man would have\r\nbeen the conqueror of Peru, instead of the cruel and ignorant Pizarro.”\r\nThe frightful destruction of the country of the Incas soon followed,\r\nwhile Cortés overran Mexico and De Soto invaded Florida.\r\n\r\nIt has doubtless by this time been in the mind of more than one\r\nreader to ask whether, while the men of the Mediterranean region were\r\nmaking these notable searchings for new shores, the men of northern\r\nEurope were standing idle. What were the mariners of France and the\r\nNetherlands, Scandinavia and Great Britain, doing? Well, all were doing\r\nsomething, and some of them produced results of novel seafaring that\r\nwere well worth the getting, but these were principally in far northern\r\nwaters, as we shall read in the next chapter. It was not until the\r\nopening of the sixteenth century that in England, at least, that era\r\nof far voyaging began which signalized the Elizabethan age on the sea\r\nas much as the poets and dramatists and statesmen-writers of her court\r\ndistinguished it on land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PEACEFUL DAY ON THE SPANISH MAIN.]\r\n\r\nIt was, however, earlier than that—in the reign of Henry VII—that\r\nEngland’s story of discovery begins, and the first names are those of\r\ntwo Italians known in English as John and Sebastian Cabot, father and\r\nson, who were then residents of Bristol. The Bristol folk were at that\r\ntime the foremost mariners of England, who often went to Iceland and\r\nall the nearer isles; and they firmly believed in certain traditional\r\nislands and coasts far away to the west, which seem to have been\r\ncomposed of no better material than the airy structures of the sunset\r\nclouds and the romantic tales of Phenician sailors and other travelers\r\nin the dawn of history. As long ago as when Strabo wrote, a century\r\nbefore the birth of Christ, these things were of old belief, and he\r\nrecounts the delights then told of the “Isles of the Blest,” west of\r\nthe farthest verge of Africa. When the Canary Islands became known as\r\nfacts, the myth moved farther west; and when acquaintance with the\r\nAzores proved them to be only natural earth with a fair share of its\r\nills, as well as of its good, people insisted that still other islands\r\nmust lie farther away, where the Elysian Fields basked in perpetual\r\nsummer and men were eternally happy. The old idea charms us even yet\r\nwhen we sing “Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood stand dressed in\r\nliving green.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VOYAGING TO THE ISLES OF THE BLEST.]\r\n\r\nBut no such higher rendering occurred to the men of the earlier time.\r\nThey believed firmly in the actual existence of these ever-fortunate\r\nislands under the sunset horizon of the Atlantic, and (in the north)\r\ncalled them the Isles of St. Brandon, the “green isle of Brazil”\r\n(the root of which word seems to express the idea of redness, such\r\nas appears in low sunset clouds), the Isle of the Seven Cities or\r\nAntillia, and by other names. Ferdinand Columbus, a son of Christopher,\r\nsays in his “History” that his father fully expected to meet, “before\r\nhe came to India, a very convenient island or continent from which he\r\nmight pursue with more advantage his main design.” This does not prove\r\nthat Columbus put any faith in the reality of these old notions, nor\r\ndoes he seem to be responsible for the fact that the name _Antilles_\r\nwas immediately attached to the archipelago he actually did meet\r\nwith, and The _Brazils_ to a part of the mainland next found. These\r\nnames had been appearing on conjectural maps of the Atlantic side of\r\nthe earth for many years before his time; and that they represented\r\nrealities to many hard-headed merchants and sailors of his time is\r\nshown conclusively by the fact that between 1480 and 1487 at least two\r\ncarefully planned naval expeditions had gone from Bristol, England,\r\nin search of them. How much vague memories of early Norse and Irish\r\nfindings in the west may have given weight in Bristol to these old\r\nmyths is hard to say; but at any rate it was there the search for this\r\npot of gold at the end of the rainbow bore unexpected and momentous\r\nresults, but all were surprised at the distance involved.\r\n\r\nAbout 1496 John Cabot, then a resident of Bristol, proposed to the\r\nking an expedition in search of a new route to the Indies by sailing\r\ndue west from Ireland. Henry VII was excited by the news of Columbus’\r\nsoutherly findings, and was eager to secure something of the kind for\r\nEngland. Nevertheless, although the king granted privileges that might\r\nprove profitable in case of success, he seems to have furnished no\r\nmoney. Cabot, therefore, sailed away, privately equipped, in a small\r\ncaravel named _Matthew_, carrying only eighteen persons.\r\n\r\nNever was a voyage of discovery, the consequences of which were so\r\nfar-reaching, entered upon with less pomp or flourish of trumpets. So\r\nlittle note of it was made at the time that the very name of John Cabot\r\nnarrowly escaped being lost altogether, and the record of his work came\r\nvery near being replaced by a confused account of the doings of his son\r\nSebastian; for it was not until certain letters had been found—and that\r\nwithin a very few years—in the contemporary archives of Spain and other\r\nEuropean countries, that we were able to give any sure account of the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nIt is now plain that John Cabot, in the _Matthew_, leaving Bristol\r\nearly in May, 1497, and having passed Ireland, shaped his course toward\r\nthe north, then turned to the west and proceeded for many days until he\r\ncame to land, where he disembarked on June 24, and planted an English\r\nflag.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no doubt that this was the mainland of North\r\nAmerica, and the general opinion has prevailed that his landfall was\r\nthe extremity of Cape Breton. Cabot stayed some days, but how far he\r\ntraced the coast, and whether he learned of Newfoundland or Prince\r\nEdward Island, are matters of conjecture. At any rate, he soon turned\r\nhomeward, and arrived in Bristol probably on August 6.\r\n\r\nWe can imagine with what eagerness his story was listened to, as he\r\ntold of the fair, temperate, well-wooded land, its people and animals\r\nand fruitfulness, that he had seen. But the thing that impressed the\r\nBristol men most was the report of the enormous abundance of codfish\r\nthere. This was something these canny men could see without any\r\nillusions, and possess themselves of regardless of papal bulls; and\r\nthey at once abandoned their northern fishing-grounds and began to\r\nresort to the Banks of Newfoundland, whither they were quickly followed\r\nby large annual fleets of Norman, Breton, Spanish, and Portuguese\r\nfishermen. John Cabot intended to go again the next year and make his\r\nway onward to Japan, as he believed he could do, for, like the others,\r\nhe thought what he had found was only a remote eastern part of Asia;\r\nand in 1498 he actually did sail westward from Bristol with five\r\nships, victualed for a year. None of these ships ever returned, and\r\nno evidence exists that they ever reached their goal; and with them\r\nJohn Cabot, to whom England owed her early supremacy in North America,\r\ndisappears from view.\r\n\r\nSebastian Cabot was a son of John Cabot, and a skilful map-maker.\r\nWhether he went with his father on the first voyage is disputed; there\r\nseems no direct evidence that he did so. That he did not go on the\r\nsecond voyage is plain, for he had a long subsequent career, of which\r\naccurate knowledge is a late acquisition; here it is only necessary\r\nto add that by his statements to Peter Martyr and others he allowed\r\nthe erroneous impression to pass into history, if he did not directly\r\nauthorize the lie, that it was he, and not his father, who discovered\r\nAmerica and the fishing-grounds.\r\n\r\nNow that the way across the Atlantic was learned, chivalrous sailors\r\nhurried to add what they could to the map. Corte-Real, a Portuguese\r\nof rank, struck northwest, and hit upon and named Labrador as early\r\nas 1500. The next voyage of prominence introduces the French as\r\ncompetitors, Francis I sending the Florentine Verrazano, a typical\r\nsea-rover of the period, who had already been to Brazil and the East\r\nIndies and was finally hanged as a pirate, to find out what he could\r\nabout northern America. He steered west from the Madeira Islands in\r\nJanuary, 1524, found land near Cape Fear (North Carolina), and claimed\r\nto have traced the coast as far north as Nova Scotia, besides entering\r\na large bay (either New York or Narragansett). His whole story,\r\nhowever, rests on certain letters and maps the authenticity of which\r\nhas been hotly disputed; and at any rate little, if anything, came of\r\nthis voyage.\r\n\r\nIt was far different with the next one, however,—that one sent from\r\nFrance in 1534, under the command of Jacques Cartier, who sailed from\r\nSt. Malo in two tiny vessels to Newfoundland, and learned of the mouth\r\nof the St. Lawrence River. Then, like all the other captains, none of\r\nwhom could stay over winter in America, because their vessels were too\r\nsmall to store provisions, and because they were beset by fears, not\r\nonly of visible savages, but of invisible hobgoblins, he returned to\r\nFrance. The next year found him back again, however, this time steering\r\nhis vessels up the St. Lawrence to “Hochelaga” (Montreal), and later\r\ncarrying home an account that led to so immediate a movement on the\r\npart of France that Canada was the scene of the earliest colonization\r\nof the New World, properly speaking, for the Spanish settlements\r\nin the south were thus far nothing but military stations. France,\r\nindeed, dreamed of obtaining the whole of North America for herself,\r\nand attempted soon after to colonize Florida and the Carolinas; but\r\nthese attempts failed, and she was able to hold only the valley of the\r\nSt. Lawrence and the shore of its gulf. These things happened later,\r\nhowever, and for many years the Atlantic coast of North America was\r\nleft unclaimed by any one, while the English and Dutch were busy in the\r\nfar north, the Spanish were rioting in the tropics, and the Portuguese\r\nturned their attention to the southern and eastern quarters of the\r\nglobe. It is one of the most striking curiosities of the history of\r\nthe development of civilization on the globe, following the stagnation\r\nof the middle ages and the desolation of the plague-ridden thirteenth\r\ncentury, that the most remote, unprofitable, unhealthy regions were so\r\nfiercely struggled for, while the best parts of the New World were left\r\nuntil the last.\r\n\r\nHaving found Brazil, both Spaniards and Portuguese proceeded to trace\r\nthe continent southward, hoping to find a practicable way to Peru\r\naround it. Several experienced navigators worked southward, the best\r\nknown of whom is Juan Diaz de Solis, who entered the La Plata River\r\nand was killed there by the Indians in 1516. Columbus had not been a\r\nmoment too soon to be first. Nevertheless it was left to a stranger in\r\nthose waters, the indomitable Magellan (Fernão de Magalhães), to reap\r\nthe reward of success. The Pope and all the bishops still declared\r\nthat the earth was flat; but so little was this now believed, even\r\nby themselves, that Magellan, who had just quitted the service of\r\nPortugal, dared to propose to “his most Catholic majesty” the King of\r\nSpain to sail west instead of east to the Moluccas, just as though the\r\nearth were globular and might be circumnavigated; and the king not only\r\ndared to listen, but approved of the proposition, which seemed entirely\r\npracticable _if_ South America could be passed. That was the problem\r\nMagellan set himself to solve. Should he succeed, could the Moluccas\r\nbe reached by sailing westward, then they would fall into that half of\r\nthe earth given by the Pope to Spain, and Portugal’s present claim to\r\nthem would be overthrown. Thus the experiment was well worth making in\r\nbehalf of politics as well as knowledge, and Magellan was furnished\r\nwith five ships, carrying two hundred and thirty-seven men. The\r\n_Trinidad_ was the admiral’s ship; but the _San Vittoria_ was destined\r\nfor immortality.\r\n\r\n  He struck boldly for the Southwest, not crossing the trough of the\r\n  Atlantic as Columbus had done, but passing down the length of it, his\r\n  aim being to find some cleft or passage in the American continent\r\n  through which he might sail into the Great South Sea. For seventy\r\n  days he was becalmed under the line. He then lost sight of the\r\n  North Star, but courageously held on toward the “pole antarktike.”\r\n  He nearly foundered in a storm, “which did not abate till the three\r\n  fires called St. Helen, St. Nicholas, and St. Clare appeared playing\r\n  in the rigging of the ships. In a new land, to which he gave the name\r\n  Patagoni, he found giants of “good corporature”.... His perseverance\r\n  and resolution were at last rewarded by the discovery of the Strait\r\n  named by him San Vittoria, in affectionate honor of his ship; but\r\n  which, with a worthy sentiment, other sailors soon changed to the\r\n  _Straits of Magellan_. On November 25, 1520, after a year and a\r\n  quarter of struggling, he issued forth from its western portals, and\r\n  entered the Great South Sea, shedding tears of joy, as Pigafetta, an\r\n  eye-witness, relates, when he recognized its infinite expanse....\r\n  Admiring its illimitable but placid surface, and exulting in the\r\n  meditation of its secret perils soon to be tried, he courteously\r\n  imposed upon it the name it is forever to bear—the _Pacific Ocean_....\r\n\r\n  And now the great sailor, having burst through the barrier of the\r\n  American continent, steered for the northwest, attempting to regain\r\n  the equator. For three months and twenty days he sailed on the\r\n  Pacific, and never saw inhabited land. He was compelled by famine to\r\n  strip off the pieces of skin and leather wherewith his rigging was\r\n  here and there bound, to soak them in the sea, and then soften them\r\n  with warm water, so as to make a wretched food; to eat the sweepings\r\n  of the ship and other loathsome matter; to drink water that had\r\n  become putrid by keeping; and yet he resolutely held on his course,\r\n  though his men were dying daily. As is quaintly observed, “their gums\r\n  grew over their teeth, and so they could not eat.” [This was scurvy,\r\n  the dread of all mariners in those times and long afterward.] He\r\n  estimated that he sailed over this unfathomable sea not less than\r\n  12,000 miles.\r\n\r\n  In the whole history of human undertakings [declares Dr. John W.\r\n  Draper, from whose striking sketch of this achievement in his\r\n  “Intellectual Development of Europe” I am quoting]—in the whole\r\n  history of human undertakings there is nothing that exceeds, if,\r\n  indeed, there is anything that equals, this voyage of Magellan’s.\r\n  That of Columbus dwindles away in comparison. It is a display of\r\n  superhuman courage, superhuman perseverance—a display of resolution\r\n  not to be diverted from its purpose by any motive or any suffering....\r\n\r\n  This unparalleled resolution met its reward at last. Magellan reached\r\n  a group of islands north of the equator—the Ladrones. In a few\r\n  days more he became aware that his labors had been successful. He\r\n  met with adventurers from Sumatra. But, though he had thus grandly\r\n  accomplished his object, it was not given to him to complete the\r\n  circumnavigation of the globe. At an island called Zebu, or Mutan,\r\n  he was killed, either, as has been variously related, in a mutiny of\r\n  his men, or, as they declared, in a conflict with the savages, or\r\n  insidiously by poison.... Hardly was he gone when his crew learned\r\n  that they were actually in the vicinity of the Moluccas [having\r\n  previously wandered too far north, and discovered the Philippines],\r\n  and that the object of their voyage was accomplished....\r\n\r\n  And now they prepared to bring the news of their success back to\r\n  Spain. Magellan’s lieutenant, Sebastian d’Elanco, directed his course\r\n  for the Cape of Good Hope, again encountering the most fearful\r\n  hardships. Out of his slender crew he lost 21 men. He doubled the\r\n  Cape at last; and on September 7, 1522, in the port of St. Lucar,\r\n  near Seville, under his orders, the good ship _Vittoria_ came safely\r\n  to an anchor. She had accomplished the greatest achievement in the\r\n  history of the human race. She had circumnavigated the earth.\r\n\r\nThe immediate result of this voyage was to impress Spain’s sovereignty\r\nupon the East Indies; but a vaster and more far-reaching consequence\r\nwas the influence it exerted, by its proof that the world was really\r\na globe, to free men’s minds from blind belief in and guidance by a\r\ntradition, which had taught that the earth was a flat plain surrounded\r\nby water,—an error sanctioned by St. Augustine and other influential\r\nteachers. Magellan impressed a name upon the greatest of the oceans,\r\nand has his own name gloriously emblazoned upon both the map of the\r\nearth and the map of the sky in the southern hemisphere; but his\r\ngreatest title to honor, after all, is that he struck dogma the hardest\r\nblow it ever received.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEA-SURF AT SANTO DOMINGO.]\r\n\r\nThe sixteenth century seems to have been, outside of the Arctic\r\nregions, an era of surveying rather than of exploration by sea, yet\r\nsome notable work was done in the East, where all nations now entered\r\nas competitors in the trade, seizing upon every island or mainland\r\nshore that they could, and holding their possessions as long as\r\npossible. Even the English entered heartily into this rivalry, the\r\ngreat East India Company having been founded in 1599. With its trading\r\nwe have nothing to do, but must note that it extended knowledge of\r\nOceanica considerably, and added greatly to Europe’s information as\r\nto India, the Malayan peninsula and larger islands, China, and Japan.\r\nThe Spanish and Portuguese found themselves so busy in defending that\r\nto which they already laid claim that they had little time to search\r\nfor new lands; and this sort of enterprise fell mainly to the Dutch,\r\nwho, now that the Netherlands were at last free from the long and cruel\r\ntyranny of Spain, were energetically making up for lost time. Their\r\ncaptain, Van Noort, went out by way of the Straits of Magellan to the\r\nPhilippines, and got back to Rotterdam between 1598 and 1601. Another\r\nfleet made the same voyage fifteen years later; and in 1616 Cape Horn\r\nwas rounded by Willem Cornelis Schouten, who gave the name of his home\r\nvillage, Hoorn, to that desolate terminus of South America.\r\n\r\nFor many years geographers had held belief in a vast “southern\r\ncontinent,”—_Terra Australis_,—and most of the islands found in the\r\nSouth Pacific were accidental results of some attempt to reach it. New\r\nGuinea had been sighted a century before, and perhaps Australia also,\r\nof which several navigators got glimpses here and there early in the\r\nsixteenth century, satisfying them that it also was a great island.\r\nIt was not until this century was half gone, however, that the map\r\nof that quarter of the “South Sea” was filled out with any accuracy;\r\nand this was due to the skill and labor of an eminent Dutch voyager,\r\nAbel Janszen Tasman, who was despatched southward with two ships by\r\nthe colonial government at Batavia, where the Dutch had already gained\r\npolitical ascendancy.\r\n\r\n“This voyage,” we are told, “proved to be the most important to\r\ngeography that had been undertaken since the first circumnavigation of\r\nthe globe.” Tasman sailed from Batavia in the yacht _Heemskirk_, on\r\nthe 14th of August, 1642, and from Mauritius on the 8th of October. On\r\nNovember 24 high land was sighted in 42° 30´ S., which was named Van\r\nDiemen’s Land (now Tasmania), and, after landing there, sail was again\r\nmade, and New Zealand (at first called Staatenland) was discovered on\r\nthe 13th of December. Tasman communicated with the natives and anchored\r\nin what he called Murderers’ Bay, because several men were massacred\r\nthere by the natives. Thence he took an irregular course east and\r\nnorth, until he arrived at the Friendly Isles of Cook. In April, 1643,\r\nhe was off the north coast of New Guinea, having meanwhile sailed\r\naround New Britain and New Ireland (now New Mecklenburg), and on June\r\n15 he returned to Batavia.\r\n\r\nThe contribution to sea-knowledge of the remaining voyages in this\r\ncentury were mainly in the direction of a better understanding of\r\nwinds, currents, ice movements, tides, and an improvement in the\r\nmethods of building, rigging, and navigating vessels intended for\r\nlong voyages. Map-making received a great impetus and was especially\r\ncultivated by the Dutch, among whom Mercator became famous by inventing\r\nthe useful projection that bears his name and is still most commonly\r\nused. Nevertheless, the improvement, especially in instruments of\r\nnavigation, was slow. The astrolabe generally gave place to the\r\ncross-staff; and this to a better device called the back-staff, of\r\nwhich an improved form, invented by John Davis, remained long in use.\r\nThis was called the Davis quadrant; and with it “the observer stood\r\nwith his back to the sun, and, looking through the sights, brought the\r\nshadow of a pin into coincidence with the horizon.” Many variations of\r\nthis instrument were made, until, in the middle of the next century, it\r\nwas superseded by the sextant. Thus before the close of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, astronomers and navigators had learned how to determine\r\nlatitude fairly accurately, and the sailor had prepared for him a\r\nvariety of tables of stars, almanacs, and other mathematical guides.\r\nThe determination of longitude was yet difficult, however, owing\r\nlargely to the imperfection of timepieces; and it was not until the\r\nlast year of the century, signalized by the first recorded sea-voyage\r\nmade purely for scientific purposes, that much advance was made. This\r\nvoyage, lasting two years (1699-1700), was undertaken by the eminent\r\nEnglish astronomer Edmund Halley for the express purpose of obtaining\r\ninformation necessary to the improvement of the compass and methods\r\nof ascertaining the position of a ship at sea, was productive of\r\nresults of the greatest service, and placed the science of navigation\r\nupon a sure footing. It was followed early in the next century by\r\nthe establishment in England of the Longitude Board, a scientific\r\ncommission charged with the duty of determining longitudes and studying\r\nnavigation. From this board came the “Nautical Almanac,” which first\r\nappeared in 1767, but similar almanacs are now published annually by\r\nthe governments of almost all maritime powers, and the editorship is\r\nesteemed in the United States one of the most honored positions in the\r\nnaval service. These books contain ephemerides, or tables of positions\r\nfor each day of that year of all the heavenly bodies, “predictions of\r\nastronomical phenomena, and the angular distances of the moon from the\r\nsun, planets, and fixed stars,” all referred to some stated meridian.\r\n\r\nWith such an almanac, an improved compass, and one of Newton’s new\r\nsextants as a means of quick and accurate observation of sun and moon\r\nand stars, the navigator had little need to doubt as to where he was;\r\nand maps began to show a corresponding improvement in accuracy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “BUCCANEERS AND MANY WILD SEA-ROVERS.”]\r\n\r\nThe early part of this century, as we shall see later, was the era of\r\nthe buccaneers and of many wild sea-rovers whose far-wandering barks,\r\nin search of adventure, picked up much information at the expense\r\nof human lives and hard-earned property. The foremost of these was\r\nDampier, who seems to have gone almost everywhere a ship could go,\r\nand who found out many new things, which he had the power of telling\r\nwell, as to Australasia; and the strait between New Guinea and New\r\nBritain, which he discovered, is named after him. Many a commander was\r\nnow cruising in those waters, however, under English and Dutch flags\r\nmainly, finding new lands and pillaging old ones—such as Roggewein,\r\nAnson, Byron, Wallis, Carteret, Bougainville, and others; and such\r\nimportant islands as Easter, Tahiti, Charlotte, and Gloucester groups,\r\nPitcairn, and others, were found during the first half of this century.\r\nBut now the English were to redeem their good name by sending out a\r\ngovernment expedition, or series of expeditions, whose object was\r\nscientific discovery and the humane study of the men and resources on\r\nthe other side of the world, instead of forced trade or bloody rapine.\r\nThese were the three expeditions commanded by Captain James Cook, one\r\nof the most capable officers in the British navy.\r\n\r\nThe first voyage was made in 1767 for the purpose of carrying a party\r\nof astronomers and naturalists to Tahiti to observe there a transit of\r\nVenus, after which a survey was made of the then almost unknown coasts\r\nof New Zealand and Eastern Australia. The second voyage was to explore\r\nthe Antarctic regions, whither the French had preceded him, as we shall\r\nsee in the next chapter; and we need only say here that Cook finally\r\ndisposed of the tradition of a vast _terra australis_—at any rate a\r\nhabitable one. It is to his third voyage, then, that he principally\r\nowes his fame.\r\n\r\nThis was undertaken in pursuance of the ruling idea of his day, that a\r\nsea-route might be discovered north of the American continent, which\r\nwould vastly shorten the trip from Europe to China and the Spice\r\nIslands. Others were seeking it directly by way of Baffin’s Bay, and\r\nCook was sent to attack the problem from the Pacific side. He was\r\ngiven command of his old ship _Resolution_ and a new one, _Discovery_,\r\noutfitted in the best possible manner, and especially guarded, in the\r\nmatter of provisions, against scurvy—that dread of the old-fashioned\r\nseamen, in respect to which Cook himself had introduced such new and\r\nvaluable preventives as would alone have entitled his name to grateful\r\nremembrance. He was commanded to revisit, on his way out, the South\r\nPacific Islands; and departed from England in June, 1776, steering by\r\nway of the Cape of Good Hope, and reaching the archipelagoes in the\r\nspring of 1777, where he cruised for nearly a year. In January, 1778,\r\nhe sailed north from the Friendly Islands, and a few days later hit\r\nupon a large, inhabited, unknown group of islands, whose principal one\r\nwas called Hawaii by the people, but which he named Sandwich Islands,\r\nin honor of an English earl who had taken great interest in his plans.\r\nHere he spent some delightful days, and then bore away to the west\r\ncoast of America, which the English still claimed under Drake’s name of\r\nNew Albion, and which he struck near Puget Sound. Thence he went slowly\r\nalong the coast northward until he found and penetrated the deep bay\r\nsince called Cook’s Inlet. His hope that this might prove a sort of\r\nnorthern Straits of Magellan was quickly disappointed, and he went on\r\ninto and through Bering Sea and Strait until he was stopped by the ice\r\non the north shore of Alaska, at a point still called Icy Cape. Then he\r\nturned back, surveying both shores of the strait, and again made his\r\nway to the Sandwich Islands, where, in an unfortunate quarrel with the\r\nnatives, he was killed. The Hawaiians have always said that this was\r\nthe act of a ruffian among them, and that the chiefs and the best of\r\nthe people never wished nor intended any harm to their visitors; and\r\nthis is probably true. His executive officer took the ships back to\r\nEngland in October, 1780.\r\n\r\nThe voyages of this able and intelligent commander bore fruit in\r\nmany ways. One was the colonization of Australia, Tasmania, and New\r\nZealand by the English, which began in 1788. Another was the voyage\r\nof Vancouver to the west coast of America in 1792, which intercepted\r\nthe surveys of the Spaniards there, under Quadra and others, and\r\nenforced English possession of all the country between the Californian\r\nsettlements of the Spaniards and the Russian posts in Alaska, though\r\nhe curiously failed to find either Puget Sound or the Columbia River.\r\nA third direct result, and from some points of view the most important\r\none, was the opening of a great number of the South Sea Islands to\r\nChristian missionaries.\r\n\r\nBy this time there had arisen in the New World which these voyagers had\r\nfirst stumbled upon, and then searched for, and afterward scrutinized\r\nso carefully, a new, composite nation, which somehow forgot that all\r\ntheir broad and fertile land had been given away centuries before by\r\nan old gentleman in Rome to his friends the Spaniards, and acted as\r\nthough they thought it belonged to themselves; and by and by this\r\nthriving nation hoisted a starry flag of its own, and proclaimed itself\r\nthe United States of America. Then, not to be behind European powers,\r\nwhose navigators were enriching libraries with magnificent chronicles\r\nof scientific studies in sea-science, such as those of the French\r\n“Voyage of the _Astrolabe_,” the Russian narratives of Krusenstern\r\nand Kotzebue, and the English explorations of Beechey (who was\r\naccompanied by Charles Darwin), the United States sent to the Pacific a\r\nwell-equipped expedition under Lieutenant (afterward Admiral) Charles\r\nWilkes. This was gone from 1838 to 1845, surveyed the west coast of\r\nSouth America, wandered about Oceanica, and did its best to penetrate\r\nthe icy limits of the Antarctic zone. The results were six magnificent\r\nfolio volumes, containing not only the narrative of the cruise, but\r\ncontributions to science by James D. Dana, Horatio Hale, John Cassin,\r\nand other men of the last generation great in American science.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: end of chapter decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nSECRETS WON FROM THE FROZEN NORTH\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the sea-routes between Europe and the far East were learned,\r\nand the American coasts had been mapped, the region within the Arctic\r\ncircle became the most attractive field for nautical discovery. All\r\nthis earlier Arctic exploration, however, was not, as it has lately\r\nbecome, a system of scientific research, but was simply a series of\r\nattempts to open new roads for commerce to follow. It occurred to every\r\nnavigator that as a sea-way had been gained past the southern end of\r\nAmerica, so one around its northern border might be disclosed; and\r\nperhaps, also, a ship-route along the northern coast of Siberia. Either\r\nof these would be far shorter than to go to “Cathay” around either\r\nCape Horn or Cape of Good Hope, and would enable the English and other\r\nnortherners to avoid their enemies, the Spanish and Portuguese, who\r\ncommanded the southern waters.\r\n\r\nThe first Arctic voyage of exploration, properly speaking, was that of\r\nWilloughby and Chancellor, who in 1553 penetrated the seas north of\r\nScandinavia, where they became separated. Willoughby and his men tried\r\nto winter on the coast of Russian Lapland, but all died of scurvy.\r\n\r\nChancellor, however, pushed on into the White Sea, reached a monastery\r\non the coast, and thence made his way to Moscow, where he was well\r\nreceived, and thus opened a trade route of incalculable advantage to\r\nboth England and Russia. It led at once to the organization of the\r\nMuscovy Company, and began a commerce now regularly carried on in\r\nsteam vessels to Archangel, which in 1897 was connected with Moscow by\r\nrailroad.\r\n\r\nBy 1580 several other commanders had tried to improve on this\r\nperformance, but none got past the Kara Sea, and the next important\r\neffort was headed toward that “Northwest Passage,” which for more than\r\nthree centuries was the lodestone of Arctic students and voyagers.\r\nIt was in charge of Martin Frobisher, later one of England’s most\r\nconspicuous admirals, who afterward made a larger expedition in which\r\nhe learned many facts about the Labrador coast and Hudson Strait.\r\nAnother English seaman, and a more scientific one, John Davis, made\r\nthree remarkable voyages, between 1585 and 1589, and increased the map\r\nby a careful delineation of both coasts of the strait still called\r\nafter him.\r\n\r\nShortly afterward Dutch merchants had sent three expeditions northward\r\nunder command of William Barentz to search for a _northeast_ passage,\r\nthe third and most important of which sailed in 1596 and found it\r\nimpossible to penetrate the ice east of Nova Zembla (which had been\r\nseen first by Burrough in 1556, who had been shown the way by Russian\r\nfishermen), but discovered Bear Island and Spitzbergen. The crew\r\nof Barentz’s vessel spent the winter of 1596-97 at Ice Haven, Nova\r\nZembla—the first successfully to face a winter in the Arctic zone.\r\nWhen the next spring came they made their way to Lapland and homeward\r\nin boats, but Barentz died on the road. This voyage was highly\r\nimportant in opening to the Netherlands the whale and seal fisheries\r\nof that region which has ever since been known as Barentz’s Sea, but\r\nit discouraged the hopes of a “northeast passage.” In 1871 Barentz’s\r\nwinter quarters at Ice Haven were found undisturbed, after a lapse of\r\n274 years, and in 1875 part of the journal kept by this brave mariner\r\nwas recovered. Almost every year about this time saw English, Dutch,\r\nand Danish ships going north, each adding some new fact to geography\r\nand the knowledge of polar waters and ice. One of them, in 1607, was\r\ncommanded by Henry Hudson, who searched the North Atlantic, found Jan\r\nMayen, and pointed the way to the Spitzbergen whale fisheries; yet he\r\nhad hardly more than a sail-boat, and a crew of only eleven men.\r\n\r\nThe following year this intrepid man tried to go to China north of\r\nAsia, but failed as Barentz had done, and returned “void of hope of a\r\nnortheast passage.” Nevertheless, he tried it again a year later in\r\nthe service of Amsterdam merchants, but his men were obstreperous,\r\nand, yielding to his own inclination as well as to theirs, he turned\r\nwest to find that “Northwest Passage” in which everybody then believed\r\nbecause they hoped, and because of the difficulty of getting so great\r\na fact as the real North American continent proved to be accepted by\r\nthe popular imagination, which was used to small things in geography.\r\nVery willingly, then, Hudson’s little ship, the _Half Moon_, was turned\r\ntoward the southwest; and it found something better than it sought, for\r\nthe Hudson River and the site of the future metropolis of the New World\r\nwere added to the map.\r\n\r\nHudson’s success in this voyage led to his immediate engagement by a\r\ncompany of English merchants and speculators, who were willing to risk\r\nadditional money in searching for a northwest passage if he would lead.\r\n\r\nIn 1610, therefore, Hudson took command of a new ship, the\r\n_Discoverie_, and sailing in her to Baffin’s Bay, found the great\r\nopening of Hudson Strait, and with high hope that his goal was now\r\nin view followed it westward into Hudson Bay. Here he coasted south\r\nto what we term James Bay, and, after a comfortable winter, resumed\r\nhis examination of the west coast, whereupon the majority of his men\r\nmutinied, set Hudson and several sick men adrift in a rowboat, and\r\nturned back. Most of the mutineers died, but the vessel was finally\r\ntaken back to London, where the murderers were promptly questioned and\r\nnearly as promptly hanged.\r\n\r\nThe story of another remarkable voyage closes the story of this early\r\nattempt at the problem which, two hundred and fifty years afterward,\r\nwas to be solved only by proof of its uselessness. In 1616 another\r\n_Discovery_—a caravel of only fifty-five tons—went north from England\r\nin charge of William Baffin. “On the 30th of May he had reached Davis’\r\nfarthest point, Sanderson’s Hope, in 72° 41´ N., ... and reached, 1st\r\nJuly, an open sea, the ‘North Water’ of the whalers of to-day. Passing\r\nCapes York, Atholl and Parry, he yet pushed northward, and on 5th July\r\nattained his farthest point within sight of Cape Alexander.\r\n\r\nHis latitude, about 77° 45´ N., remained unequaled in that sea for two\r\nhundred and thirty-six years.” Arctic success depends on good luck.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FANTASTIC ICEBERGS IN HUDSON STRAIT.]\r\n\r\nThe next century (1700 to 1800) was a period of active polar research\r\nin the Old World. The Russians completed their knowledge of their\r\nArctic coasts, Popoff reaching East Cape in 1711, and bringing back\r\nan account not only of various islands, but also of a continental\r\nshore eastward. It was this report that caused Peter the Great to set\r\non foot a costly scheme of research upon the northeastern coasts of\r\nSiberia, which was placed in the hands of Vitus Bering, a Dane, in his\r\nnavy, but accomplished nothing of any value; and it was not until 1740\r\nthat Bering finally crossed over in a blundering sort of way and made\r\na brief examination of the coast of Alaska, where his ship was finally\r\nwrecked, and he died of discouragement and chagrin. He saw neither the\r\nsea nor the strait that bears his name, was not the first to reach the\r\nAmerican continent, and never learned whether or not it was connected\r\nwith Siberia. Nevertheless his voyage had fruitful results, for it\r\nled to vast fisheries and fur-gatherings, and the writings of his\r\nnaturalist, Steller, had and still have great scientific importance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A WALRUS BREEDING-GROUND, BERING STRAIT.]\r\n\r\nBy this time the whaling and allied marine industries, and the work of\r\nsuch excellent explorers as the Dutchman Martens, had made mariners\r\nthoroughly acquainted with the North Atlantic from Nova Zembla to\r\nGreenland, and a vast advance had been effected in the knowledge of\r\nnavigation amid the ice, and in the building and equipment of ships\r\nand the proper methods of provisioning and clothing and treating crews\r\nin order to maintain health and comfort as well as mere safety. These\r\nwell-fitted and daringly managed whalers had at the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century begun to penetrate far into the waters west of\r\nGreenland, in spite of a very curious fact, which would make anybody\r\nbut a British whaleman pause—namely, that there were no such waters. So\r\ntheir best maps and treatises said!\r\n\r\nTwo hundred years had now passed since Baffin’s return from his\r\nwonderful voyage of 1616, and during all that time not a white man’s\r\nkeel had plowed the chilling solitudes he had left, except lately these\r\nventuresome whalers, who did not frequent libraries. Consequently\r\nBaffin’s work had first been forgotten and then disbelieved; so that\r\nat last first-class maps were published which omitted Baffin’s Bay\r\naltogether, and books were written, such as Barrows’ “Arctic Voyages”\r\n(London, 1818), that denied the authenticity of his narrative. As the\r\nnineteenth century opened, however, England began to turn her attention\r\nto the renewal of polar studies. The Hudson’s Bay Company’s men were\r\nreaching the coast of their Territories here and there; but otherwise\r\nthe whole Arctic Ocean north of British America was unknown.\r\n\r\nTo relieve herself of the shame of this Great Britain soon sent into\r\nthat field a rapid succession of explorers, many of whom soon became\r\nfamous. The very first of these, John Ross, despatched in 1818,\r\nconfirmed fully the geography laid down by Baffin as far as Cape York,\r\nin spite of the learned book-makers, and reported a great number and\r\nvariety of interesting facts; whereupon a much larger expedition was at\r\nonce arranged and placed in command of a naval officer named William\r\nEdward Parry, who went out in 1819 with orders to find the northwest\r\npassage, and who had in his staff such men as Sabine, Liddon, James\r\nRoss, Reid, Crozier, and similar material, all stimulated not only by\r\nnaval and scientific pride, but by the offer by Parliament of a reward\r\nof $100,000 to him who should first discover the desired thoroughfare.\r\n\r\nThis first voyage was a grand success. Forcing his way into Lancaster\r\nSound in midsummer, Parry found that Ross’s report that it was a\r\nlandlocked bay was erroneous. As Greely tells it:\r\n\r\n  The mirage-mountains of the previous year had vanished, and as Parry\r\n  crowded sail westward, he opened a series of magnificent waterways\r\n  hitherto unknown. The way lay through an archipelago (Parry), with\r\n  North Devon, Cornwallis, Bathurst and Melville islands to the north,\r\n  and Cockburn, Prince of Wales, and Banks islands to the south.\r\n  Lancaster Sound, broken at its western end by Prince Regent Inlet,\r\n  gave way to Barrow Strait, which broadened into Melville Sound, while\r\n  yet farther to the west the encroaching land formed Banks Strait\r\n  wherethrough these channels open into polar ocean.\r\n\r\nIf you will look at the map you will see that this list comprehends\r\npretty nearly everything south of Smith Sound. Many details of course\r\nwere lacking, and these Parry was sent a second time to work out,\r\nbut he added really little to geography by two seasons of hard work;\r\nand a third voyage, begun in May, 1824, was still more unfortunate.\r\nThese voyages, however, enabled Parry, who was one of the greatest\r\nof all Arctic students and navigators, to state that the western\r\nsides of all northerly and southerly bodies of water are always more\r\nencumbered with ice than the eastern sides; and to make many most\r\nvaluable improvements in ice navigation and equipment. His illustrated\r\nnarratives remain among the most readable books of Arctic experience,\r\nand little has been added to their accounts of eastern Eskimo life and\r\ncustoms.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile (1819) another navy officer, who was ardent in the scientific\r\nbranches of his profession, as well as distinguished in seamanship and\r\nnaval warfare, and who had acquired Arctic experience under Buchan in\r\nthe ill-starred expedition of 1818, was sent overland to coöperate with\r\nothers in defining the mainland coast of America. This was Lieutenant\r\nJohn Franklin—a name destined to become the most famous of all among\r\nthe explorers of the frozen North. For several years he and his\r\nparties lived and traveled among the Eskimos, tracing the coast-line\r\nfrom a considerable distance east of the mouth of the Coppermine\r\nRiver westward almost to Point Barrow, Alaska, where they came within\r\none hundred and forty-six miles of meeting Beechey’s coöperative\r\nexamination by sea from Bering’s Strait; and it was out of these trips\r\nthat we got the valuable treatises upon the natural history of British\r\nAmerica, published by his assistants, Hearne and Richardson. This ended\r\nin 1826.\r\n\r\nThe next prominent expedition was that of Captain John Ross and his\r\nnephew James, afterward celebrated in Antarctic exploration; and it\r\nturned out an exceedingly productive one. Meeting fortunate conditions\r\nin Lancaster Sound he easily reached where the _Fury_ had gone\r\nashore, and refilled his ship with a portion of the stores Parry had\r\nthoughtfully landed and made safe there—a provision which later kept\r\nthis expedition from destruction. Then he pressed on beyond where\r\nParry had gone, and added largely to the details of his map, but\r\ncuriously failed to recognize Bellot Strait as a thoroughfare, and so\r\nunaccountably missed the thing he was in search of. Ross discovered\r\nBoothia Felix; and during the three winters spent on its eastern shore,\r\nthe younger Ross, by sledging, discovered Franklin Passage, Victoria\r\nStrait, and King William’s Land, and largely explored their coasts;\r\nbut his most important work, “giving imperishable renown to his name,”\r\nas Greely declares, was the determination of the position of the north\r\nmagnetic pole on the west coast of Boothia Felix.\r\n\r\n“The experiences, duration, and results of this voyage,” writes General\r\nA. W. Greely, “are among the most extraordinary on record. The party\r\npassed five years in the Arctic regions without fatality, save three\r\n(two from non-Arctic causes), discovered a new land, the northern\r\nextremity of the continent of America, and made other extensive\r\ngeographical discoveries. Its observations are probably the most\r\nvaluable single set ever made within the Arctic circle.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ESKIMOS IN SUMMER TENTS.]\r\n\r\nDuring the third winter (1833) a rescuing party under Captain C. Back\r\nhad gone from England overland in search of Ross; and recruited by\r\nHudson’s Bay Company men of experience had descended Fish (or Back’s)\r\nRiver to its mouth, thus noting a new point on the map; but it failed\r\nto reach Ross. By similar overland journeys from their trading-posts\r\non Great Slave Lake and elsewhere, the Hudson’s Bay Company’s men,\r\nespecially Simpson, Dease, and Rae, connected various points of the\r\ncoast, so that before 1850 it was known with substantial accuracy from\r\nMelville Peninsula to Bering Strait. In much the same way Russian\r\nsledge-travelers had traced the northern Asiatic coast by descending\r\nto the mouths of rivers; but no ship had yet succeeded in passing Gape\r\nChelyuskin, the northernmost point of Asia or any continental land.\r\n\r\nThen came a period of the keenest rivalry and richest results in the\r\nhistory of polar conquest, but also one of the greatest catastrophes.\r\nThe expeditions of Lieutenant John Franklin in 1818 and 1819 were\r\nspoken of a moment ago. His services then and subsequently had been\r\nrecognized by the British king, who, among other honors, had made\r\nFranklin a knight, and sent him to be governor of Van Diemen’s Land\r\n(Tasmania), where he remained from 1836 to 1843, founded a prosperous\r\ncolony, and was regarded as one of the wisest, kindest, and most\r\nupright men of his day. Upon his return to England Franklin was made\r\ncommander of the most important expedition that had ever yet been\r\nfitted out to search for the Northwest Passage, and his reputation\r\nbrought the best men as volunteers to his standard. Having selected 134\r\nofficers and men, and made the best equipment possible, Captain Sir\r\nJohn Franklin sailed on May 19, 1845, in the _Erebus_ and _Terror_,\r\nParry’s old ships. On the 26th of July they were seen proceeding\r\nprosperously up Baffin’s Bay by a whaler, who reported them in due\r\ncourse, but neither ships or crews were heard of again for many years.\r\n\r\nAnxiety over the long silence at length aroused the people of England\r\nand the United States to begin a search for them which lasted through\r\nmany years. It was fruitless as to its first object,—the rescue of\r\nFranklin or any survivors,—but it gradually cleared up the sad mystery,\r\nand it was the means of learning all, and more than all, that Franklin\r\nsought to ascertain.\r\n\r\nThe search began by the despatch, early in 1848, of Sir James Ross in\r\ntwo ships, _Investigator_ and _Enterprise_, which wintered near the\r\nnortheast point of North Devon, and returned the following year with no\r\ntidings, although they afforded the second officer, Lieutenant F. R.\r\nM’Clintock, an opportunity to acquire a knowledge of sledging, which\r\nhe afterward used to advantage. This failure only aroused England to\r\nrenewed efforts.\r\n\r\nMany ships were started out at once, and also parties overland, of\r\nwhich mention will be made later. The _Herald_ and _Plover_, during\r\n1848 and 1849, scanned the whole coast from Bering Sea to the mouth of\r\nthe Mackenzie, and discovered Herald Island. Following them, in March,\r\n1850, went the _Enterprise_, under Collinson, and the _Investigator_,\r\nunder M’Clure, via Bering Strait, while the _Assistance_ and\r\n_Resolute_, with two steam tenders, under Captain Austin, went to\r\nrenew the search by Barrow Strait, and two brigs, the _Lady Franklin_\r\nand _Sophia_, under a whaling captain named Penny, followed them. The\r\neastern expeditions discovered Franklin’s winter quarters of 1845-46\r\nat Beechey Island, but no record of any kind indicating the direction\r\ntaken by his ships. Admirable arrangements were made for passing the\r\nwinter, and their combined sailing and sledging work added much to the\r\nmap of that district, and to our knowledge of life in polar latitudes,\r\nbut it learned nothing whatever of Franklin’s fate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FLOATING ICE-CASTLE OF THE FROZEN NORTH.\r\n\r\n  “Out from the dark, mysterious North,\r\n      With all its glamour, every night\r\n\r\n  Tingling with unforgotten dreams,\r\n      And every day flood-full of light.”\r\n]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the expedition via Bering Sea had become separated in the\r\nPacific, and M’Clure, in the _Investigator_, got so far ahead that he\r\nwas able to pass through Bering Strait and work his way eastward north\r\nof British America, and through the narrow Prince of Wales Strait until\r\nhe reached Princess Royal Islands, where he wintered. Here he was only\r\nthirty miles from Barrow Strait; and when he had climbed a high hill\r\nand saw its ice gleaming in the distance, he had in reality discovered\r\nthe Northwest Passage. Yet he was not the first, as we now know, for\r\nwhen the survivors of Franklin’s ships, in their attempt to escape,\r\nhad reached Cape Herschel, they, too, saw this same passage they had\r\nbeen sent to find, but then, as now, it was closed by perpetual ice,\r\nso that although we now know the way, we can no more avail ourselves\r\nof it than could they, except by going south of King William’s Land,\r\nthrough a strait of which they had not yet learned. The next summer\r\nwas spent in a fruitless struggle to get north along the western side\r\nof Banks (or Baring) Land, in which he succeeded only far enough to get\r\nfrozen in so firmly on the north shore of that great island that even\r\nthe summer warmth did not release his ship. He would have perished had\r\nit not been that musk-oxen were plentiful; and by the spring of 1853,\r\nit was plain that the _Investigator_ must be abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe _Enterprise_ meanwhile had followed M’Clure in the spring of 1851,\r\nand passed two years in searching every shore and passage she could\r\nfind, while her men made sledge-journeys far and near, as M’Clure’s men\r\nwere doing, and once came within a few miles of Point Victory, where\r\nFranklin’s remains would have been found. At last, in the spring of\r\n1854, she succeeded in making her way back along the American coast,\r\nand returned to England, completing one of the most remarkable of\r\nArctic voyages.\r\n\r\nDuring their absence the friends of Franklin had not been idle. The\r\napparent sacrifice of this fine character aroused almost or quite as\r\nmuch interest in America as in England, and Yankee shipmasters knew\r\nthe north as well as did the men of England and Scandinavia. Henry\r\nGrinnell, a prominent merchant in New York, furnished the money to fit\r\nout two ships, the _Advance_ and _Rescue_, commanded by Lieutenants De\r\nHaven and Griffiths, of the United States navy. They assisted in the\r\nsearch about Beechey Island, then struck north and discovered Grinnell\r\nLand, after which they returned before the winter had closed in. With\r\nthem was a young physician and traveler, Dr. Elisha Kent Kane, who\r\npersuaded Mr. Grinnell to send him again to the north, less to search\r\nfor Franklin, whom he had despaired of, than to prosecute explorations\r\nin higher latitudes. In 1853, in command of the little brig _Advance_,\r\nmanned principally by whaling men, he left New London, Conn., and\r\nmade his way straight up to the head of Baffin’s Bay, which narrows\r\nnorthward into Smith Sound, where, on the eastern, or Greenland, shore\r\nof its expansion, since called Kane Basin, he was stopped by ice and\r\nremained a prisoner until rescued in 1855.\r\n\r\nDr. Kane wrote the histories of these expeditions, and especially of\r\nthe latter one, in books so charmingly expressed, and abounding in such\r\nnovel information, that they were read like romances in every home in\r\nthe land, and did more to fire the ardor for Arctic discovery which has\r\never since glowed in this country, than anything else that had been\r\nsaid or done. The most immediate result was that Dr. I. I. Hayes, who\r\nhad been with Kane, took a ship to Smith Sound and spent the winter of\r\n1860-61 there, but with little result. More came from the expeditions\r\nled by an enthusiastic journalist of Cincinnati, Charles F. Hall, but\r\nbefore speaking of these, let us return to the English search for\r\nFranklin.\r\n\r\nUndeterred by the failure of Austin and Penny, or the silence of\r\nCollinson and M’Clure, the British government in 1852 despatched again\r\nthe four vessels used by Austin, and added a fifth, the _Assistance_,\r\nand a store-ship, the _North Star_, to form a depôt of supplies\r\nat Beechey Island. The old haphazard ways had given place to very\r\nsystematic methods of advance and rescue; but steam was little employed\r\nas yet, because of the trouble and cost of supplying coal, although two\r\nsmall steam vessels, as tenders, accompanied this, the largest and most\r\nbountifully equipped expedition that had yet started out. The fleet,\r\nunder command of Sir Edward Belcher, proceeded through Lancaster Sound,\r\nbeyond which they scattered somewhat, and spent the first winter in\r\nextensive sledge-journeys, during which they discovered (by a message\r\nthat M’Clure had left on Melville Island) where the _Investigator_ was\r\nimprisoned, and rescued all its people in June, 1853.\r\n\r\nThis great expedition learned nothing of Franklin, although it did\r\nlearn much of other Arctic matters, and left the map substantially\r\ncomplete south and west of Jones Sound; but its honors rested upon\r\nM’Clure, who, first of all recorded men, had really made the Northwest\r\nPassage by sailing and sledging around the northern end of America. The\r\nsettlement of this long-discussed matter had proved it of no practical\r\nvalue; but the British Parliament kept its word, and gave £10,000 (half\r\nof the promised reward) to the officers and crew of the _Investigator_,\r\nbesides raising M’Clure to knighthood. An incident of this expedition\r\nis the fact that Kellett’s abandoned ship _Resolute_ survived crushing\r\nlong enough to drift out through Barrow Strait and Lancaster Sound and\r\ndown into Davis Strait, where in September, 1855, she was found and\r\ntowed home by an American whaler. As she was little injured, she was\r\npresented to the British government with the compliments of the United\r\nStates, and a few years later, when she came to be broken up, a fine\r\ntable was made from her oaken timbers, and returned as a present to\r\nUncle Sam; and it now stands in the private office of the President of\r\nthe United States in the Executive Mansion at Washington.\r\n\r\nTwo great facts had now been ascertained. One was that none of\r\nFranklin’s men or ships survived. The other fact was, that although\r\nthere was plenty of water north of the American continent, it was so\r\nobstructed by permanent ice that probably no vessel could ever make its\r\nway through from the Atlantic to the Pacific; none has done so yet,\r\ndespite the determined effort of the steam yacht _Pandora_ in 1875,\r\nbut ships from the east have reached points also reached by ships from\r\nthe west. The everlasting ice sheet of the polar ocean, ever crowding\r\ndown upon this northern coast and into the channels between the islands\r\nnorth of it, forms a barrier that will very rarely, if ever, pause or\r\nopen long enough to let a vessel through, even south of King William\r\nand Victoria lands. The outflowing warm waters of the rivers or other\r\ninfluences may sometimes produce a narrow space comparatively free from\r\nice in summer along the shore of the continent and greater islands; but\r\neverywhere off shore, and never at a great distance, begins a thick\r\nmass of perpetual ice, which, it is believed, extends across the pole\r\nlike a cap, and reaches on the other side nearly to Petermannland. To\r\nthis has been given the name of the Paleocrystic Sea, or sea of ancient\r\nice, and nothing is known of it beyond the blue cliffs of its margin\r\nthat confronts the explorer as he gazes abroad from the hills of the\r\nParry Islands or Banks Land, or vainly seeks in some lone vessel north\r\nof Alaska or Siberia to penetrate its glassy front.\r\n\r\nSo thoroughly were the islands of this archipelago explored, and so\r\nunpromising seems further study, that Arctic voyagers have long ceased\r\nto risk their ships there, and the story of Franklin’s fate was finally\r\nlearned by land travelers. As early as 1854 Dr. Rae and a party of\r\nHudson’s Bay Company’s men had traveled over land and ice to King\r\nWilliam’s Land, proved it an island, and heard stories of the death by\r\nfamine and cold of white men who could be no other than the Franklin\r\ncrew, as was further shown by various relics which Dr. Rae obtained\r\nfrom the Eskimos. Dr. Rae claimed and received £10,000 of the reward\r\noffered by the British government. The next year another party, going\r\ndown the Great Fish River, recovered many other articles from Eskimos\r\nat the mouth of the river and on Montreal Island. It was evident even\r\nthen that every one had perished in an attempt, nearly successful, to\r\nreach the mainland at the mouth of this river. Lady Franklin, however,\r\ndespatched an expedition in the _Fox_, under the command of the\r\nexperienced M’Clintock, which at last brought back, not her husband,\r\nbut the satisfaction of knowing fully his fate.\r\n\r\nAll along the west and south coast remains of articles belonging to\r\nthe ships were found, and skeletons—two of them in a broken boat; and\r\nfinally in a stone cairn a written record that briefly told the tale of\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WORKING THROUGH AN ICE-FLOE, IN TOW OF A BERG.]\r\n\r\nIn 1845-46 Franklin quartered at Beechey Island, on the southeast coast\r\nof North Devon, after having ascended Wellington Channel to latitude\r\n77°, and returned west of Cornwallis Island, which was an exceedingly\r\nsuccessful season’s work. In the autumn of 1846 he had turned toward\r\nthe south, but had been stopped by and frozen into the masses of ice\r\nthat come ceaselessly down M’Clintock Channel and press upon King\r\nWilliam’s Land. Had he known King William’s Land to be really an island\r\nhe need not have exposed himself to this. During all the summer of 1847\r\nthe ships remained firm in their icy bonds. Sir John Franklin died,\r\nand Captain Crozier took command. The spring of 1848 brought no hope,\r\nand in April the ships were abandoned. The crews started southward\r\nalong the shore, dragging two boats (one of which was soon abandoned)\r\nand many sledges. The Eskimos said the men dropped down one at a time,\r\nfrom weakness and hunger; but it is believed that many of them were\r\nkilled by the savages for the sake of what few things they had with\r\nthem—precious articles to those natives. It appears that one of the\r\nvessels must have been crushed in the ice, and the other stranded on\r\nthe shore of King William’s Land, where it lay for years, forming a\r\nmine of wealth for the neighboring Eskimos. Some years later Lieutenant\r\nSchwatka and W. H. Gilder, traveling with Eskimo parties in the region\r\nnear the mouth of the Great Fish River, found the graves of the last\r\nremnant of the party, and recovered still other relics of this dreadful\r\ncalamity. Let me copy for you here the postscript, written by Crozier\r\nand Fitzjames, to the short record of their work. It is startlingly\r\nbrief and impressive:\r\n\r\n  April 25, 1848. H. M. ships _Terror_ and _Erebus_ were deserted on\r\n  22nd April, five leagues N. N. W. of this [Point Victory], having\r\n  been beset since 12th September, 1846. The officers and crews,\r\n  consisting of 105 souls under the command of Captain F. R. M.\r\n  Crozier, landed here in lat. 69° 37´ 42´´ N., long. 98° 41´ W. Sir\r\n  John Franklin died on the 11th June, 1847; and the total loss by\r\n  deaths in the expedition has been to this date 9 officers and 15 men.\r\n  We start on to-morrow, 26th April, 1848, for Back’s Fish River.\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious to attempt to chronicle the almost yearly\r\nexcursions into the north, but a few ought to be spoken of. One such\r\nhas been alluded to—that of Charles Hall, a Cincinnati journalist,—who\r\nenlisted the aid of the American Geographical Society, and then\r\nprepared himself by going upon a whaler and spending the winters of\r\n1860-61 and 1861-1862 among the Eskimos near Cumberland Sound, where he\r\nfound the remains of a stone house built by Frobisher in 1578. Again,\r\nfrom 1864 to 1869 he was living with the wandering Eskimo north of\r\nHudson’s Bay, preparing himself to undertake an expedition which may\r\nbe said to be the first whose avowed object was to try to reach the\r\nNorth Pole. The United States government furnished him the steamer\r\n_Polaris_, and a small but efficient body of scientific assistants,\r\none of whom was Emil Bessels. The _Polaris_ passed through Smith\r\nSound, and after completing the exploration of Kennedy Channel, and\r\ndiscovering that beyond its expansion into Hall Sound it continued\r\nstraight northeastward, forming Robeson Channel, Hall stopped his ship\r\nand by sledge-journeys reached Cape Brevoort, above 82° N., whence\r\nhe could see the open polar sea. This was not only far beyond any\r\nprevious northing, but his work added immensely to our knowledge of\r\nboth Grinnell Land and northwestern Greenland, and prepared the way for\r\nfurther successes.\r\n\r\nThis sledge-journey was, however, too great a strain, for he had hardly\r\nreturned to his ship when he sickened and died. The next season (1872)\r\nDr. Bessels and Sergeant Mayer reached on foot 82° 09´ N., a few miles\r\nfarther than Hall. This accomplished, an attempt was made to return,\r\nbut the steamer was soon inclosed in the pack, and drifted helplessly\r\nsouthward for two months, until off Northumberland Island, when a\r\nviolent gale loosened the pack and nearly destroyed her.\r\n\r\n  At length the danger became so great that on October 15th boats and\r\n  provisions were put on the ice, on which nineteen of the crew had\r\n  disembarked. Suddenly the ship broke away, and the party on the\r\n  ice drifted slowly 195 days, and were picked up off the coast of\r\n  Labrador, in 53° 35´ N., by a whaling steamer 1,300 miles from where\r\n  they had parted with the _Polaris_. The party in the ship reached\r\n  Littleton’s Island, where they passed the winter, building two boats\r\n  from the boards of the vessel, in which they set sail southwards in\r\n  June, 1873. On the 23d of that month they were picked up by a Dundee\r\n  whaler, and ultimately reached home.\r\n\r\nOnly three years before that a very similar experience had happened to\r\nthe smaller ship of a German expedition under Captain Koldewey, of\r\nwhich the larger went up the east coast of Greenland to 75½° N., where\r\na grim headland was named Cape Bismarck. It is just south of the land\r\nsighted by Lambert in 1670. The little _Hansa_, however, was crushed\r\nin the ice near Scoresby Sound. The crew escaped to the floe, where\r\nthey built a house of blocks of patent fuel, filled it with provisions,\r\nand trusted themselves to the great Arctic current which carried them\r\nsouth, at the rate of about sixty-five miles a day at first, until\r\nfinally, in June, 1870, it took them to the Moravian missions near Cape\r\nFarewell, more than twelve hundred miles from where they were wrecked.\r\n\r\nThe seas and archipelagoes north of Europe were being questioned, all\r\nthis time, as well as those north of America. The Norwegian fishermen\r\nhad been familiar with Spitzbergen waters from long ago, but it was not\r\nuntil 1863 that the group was circumnavigated. The next year Captain\r\nTobieson sailed around Northeast Land, and in 1870 Nova Zembla was\r\ncircumnavigated, and the mouth of the Obi reached.\r\n\r\nThe men who did these feats were sealers or shark-fishers in small\r\nstanch Norwegian schooners, which flocked in Barentz Sea at this\r\nperiod, and they furnished invaluable material, as did the whalers and\r\nsealers of American and Scotch ports, for the ice-pilots and crews of\r\nthe scientific expeditions which now began to go to the north: moreover\r\nmany of the commanders were trained by amateur service in such vessels.\r\nIt was thus Nordenskjöld began his experiences in 1864. Among these\r\nearlier expeditions was an Austrian naval lieutenant, Julius von Payer,\r\nwho became notable, not only because he interested a new nation in\r\nArctic research, but because of his discoveries. His first experience\r\nwas with the German expedition to Greenland in 1869, and in 1871 he\r\nand another Austrian navy officer named Weyprecht spent the summer in\r\nexamining the edge of the ice between Spitzbergen and Nova Zembla.\r\n\r\nTheir observations led them to project an expedition to try again at\r\nthat place to penetrate eastward, and effect the Northeast Passage,\r\nwhich had been regarded as hopeless for the past hundred years. The\r\nidea of making an Austro-Hungarian expedition of it aroused great\r\nenthusiasm in that empire, and Payer and Weyprecht were furnished with\r\nthe large steamer _Tegethoff_, equipped as well as possible, with\r\nWeyprecht in command, while von Payer was to lead all sledge-parties.\r\nShe reached the northern end of Nova Zembla in time to get into\r\ncomfortable winter quarters, but instead of escaping in the spring was\r\nkept imprisoned in the ice, drifting steadily northward before the\r\nprevailing wind until, in October, land was approached, near which\r\nthe ship again became a fixture for the winter of 1873-74. In March\r\nPayer began to make exploratory journeys, and found that they had\r\ndiscovered a group of mountainous islands, separated by broad and deep\r\nchannels, which he named Francis Joseph Land, in honor of the Emperor\r\nof Austria-Hungary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SUMMER SCENE OFF NOVA ZEMBLA]\r\n\r\nBy this time summer was approaching, when it was plain that the\r\n_Tegethoff_ must be abandoned, and an attempt made to get home afoot.\r\nOn the 24th of May three boats were placed on sledges, other sledges\r\nwere loaded with provisions, and the ship’s company started on another\r\none of those Arctic marches that often end at so sad a goal. Until the\r\n14th of August they were plodding over the ice before they reached the\r\nedge of the pack and launched their boats, in which they sailed for\r\nthree weeks before being picked up by a Russian vessel.\r\n\r\nThis has always been regarded as one of the greatest achievements in\r\npolar work of this century, not only because of the heroism and skill\r\nshown, and the new lands discovered, but because it promised so much\r\nfor the future—a promise that has been largely fulfilled.\r\n\r\nThe next important expedition was another attack upon the Northeast\r\nPassage, the hope of which would not “down”; and it was under the\r\nleadership of Professor Adolf Erik Nordenskjöld, a Swedish geologist\r\nand naturalist of Stockholm, although born in Finland, who had made\r\nseveral previous journeys to Greenland, Spitzbergen, etc., which\r\nwere fruitful of scientific results. Then he turned his attention to\r\nSiberia; and in 1875 and again in 1876 he sailed to the mouth of the\r\nYenisei, as also Captain Wiggins of Sunderland, England, was then\r\ndoing, in a profitable trade with the Siberians, which has been kept\r\nup more or less regularly ever since. These experiences convinced him\r\nthat it was worth while to try once more to work one’s way through the\r\nSiberian ocean to Bering Strait.\r\n\r\nHe obtained and outfitted the steamer _Vega_, and arranged that a\r\nsmaller supply-steamer, the _Lena_, should accompany him as far as the\r\nmouth of the river Lena—a bold proposition in itself, for that was\r\na thousand miles beyond the Yenisei. Nevertheless, this program was\r\ncarried out; for leaving Gothenberg on July 4, 1878, a month later they\r\nwere traversing the Kara Sea, and on August 19 passed Cape Chelyuskin,\r\nwhich, up to that time, had defied all attempts and has since closed\r\nthe gate to all but the daring Nansen. A week later the mouth of the\r\nLena was reached, and the little tender, unloading her coal and other\r\nstores into the depleted hold of the _Vega_, turned west, and actually\r\nsailed back to civilization uninjured.\r\n\r\nThe _Vega_ then hastened on eastward, and came near getting right\r\nthrough to Bering Strait in that one season; but this was more than the\r\nindulgent Arctic gods could grant, and at the end of September the men\r\nfound themselves frozen into the ice off North Cape (where Cook turned\r\nback in 1778), only one hundred and twenty miles from Bering Strait.\r\nHere they were near shore, the country was inhabited by Tchuktches—a\r\nnomadic people, with herds of reindeer, who take the place in Siberia\r\nof the Eskimos of Arctic America; and the time was well spent in\r\ngathering a knowledge of these people and their country, and in making\r\nvery valuable collections in zoology and anthropology.\r\n\r\nIt was not until July 18, 1879, however, that their prison-gates\r\nopened, and the _Vega_ steamed on. These waters were familiar enough\r\nto navigators; and Nordenskjöld proceeded straight east, passed down\r\nthrough Bering Strait on the next day but one (so near was he), and\r\nthus easily accomplished that which had baffled men since first it had\r\nbeen tried by the unfortunate Willoughby three hundred and twenty-six\r\nyears before.\r\n\r\nBut though the Northeast Passage had thus been found, it was of no more\r\npractical value to commerce than the solving of the Northwest Passage\r\nhad been, and the value received from the cruise was in the scientific\r\ninformation gained, the more accurate delineation of the coast, and the\r\nincreased knowledge of winds, currents, magnetic phenomena, and the\r\nbehavior of the floating ice-fields on that side of the polar area.\r\nWhen at last, however, the _Vega_ had circumnavigated the globe by this\r\nextraordinary course, returning home through the Suez Canal, as no\r\nArctic expedition had ever been expected to do, its commander was made\r\na baron, and all his men were loaded with praises and honors, while his\r\nbook, “The Voyage of the _Vega_,” printed in four or five languages,\r\nspread their fame throughout the world.\r\n\r\nNow while the _Vega_ was drifting slowly about northeast of Siberia\r\nduring that early summer of 1879, not only were Schwatka hunting for\r\nFranklin relics with the Eskimos of King William’s Land, the Danish\r\nCaptain Jansen tracing the northeast coast of Greenland, and Dutch and\r\nEnglish explorers investigating the neighborhood of Francis Joseph\r\nLand, but within a few leagues of Nordenskjöld and his men there\r\nwas beginning one of the most dreadful of those tragedies that have\r\nseared with suffering the track of Arctic exploration since men began\r\nto pry into the secrets of the frozen North: I mean the story of the\r\n_Jeannette_.\r\n\r\nMany readers of this book will easily remember the intense interest\r\nwhich the starting of this expedition created in the United States, for\r\nit was organized at the suggestion and expense of James Gordon Bennett,\r\nthe proprietor of the New York _Herald_. The government coöperated,\r\nhowever, lending from its navy the officers and men needful, and\r\notherwise aiding the project. The vessel itself was the steam yacht\r\n_Pandora_, which had been proved a worthy craft by Sir Allen Young in\r\nhis search for the magnetic pole in 1875, and which Mr. Bennett had\r\nbought and rechristened.\r\n\r\nSupplied with everything science and experience could suggest, the\r\n_Jeannette_ sailed from San Francisco on July 8, 1879, and missing the\r\nincoming _Vega_ among the fogs of Bering Sea, passed through into the\r\nSiberian ocean, bound poleward. The last report of her was that she had\r\nbeen seen September 3d steaming toward Wrangell Land, which had been\r\nsighted by American whalers in 1867, and was generally regarded as of\r\ncontinental extent northward. It is now known that De Long intended to\r\nreach it and winter there; but to his dismay he could not escape from\r\nthe ice-pack, and to his astonishment found himself drifting past\r\nthe northern margin of Wrangell Land, thus proving it an island about\r\nseventy miles long.\r\n\r\nWhen two years had passed and no tidings had been received, the\r\nUnited States government equipped a search expedition in the steamer\r\n_Rodgers_, commanded by Lieutenant Berry, which in 1881 reached\r\nand examined Wrangell Land, and then went north farther even than\r\nCollinson, reaching 73° 44´, the highest point yet attained immediately\r\nnorth of Bering Strait, where the paleocrystic ice spreads much farther\r\nfrom the pole than on the American side. But he found no trace of\r\nthe _Jeannette_, and himself had a hard time getting home, for the\r\n_Rodgers_ was burned in her winter quarters.\r\n\r\nWhat then had befallen the lost vessel? She had become beset in the ice\r\nand drifted with the pack around the north end of Wrangell Island, and\r\nthen west, until at the end of twenty-two months she had been crushed,\r\nand sunk on June 12, 1881, in latitude 77° 15´ N., and longitude 155\r\nE. Two small islands, named Jeannette and Henrietta, had been visited\r\nsome distance east of the scene of the catastrophe; but when the crews,\r\nsaving themselves and what little they could on the ice, started to\r\ndrag their boats and sledges homeward, they headed directly south, and\r\nsoon found a new island, named Bennett, which is the northernmost of\r\nthe New Siberia group.\r\n\r\nIt would be a sad task, were it possible, to relate here the frightful\r\nhardships of that journey through the fast-gathering Arctic night\r\ntoward the bleak coast of Siberia. Having passed the islands, open\r\nwater was found, and the starving men embarked in their three boats for\r\nthe mouth of the Lena; but soon they were separated in a storm, and\r\neach one proceeded as best he could. One boat foundered in the first\r\ngale. Another, in charge of Melville (now engineer-in-chief, U. S. N.),\r\nreached an eastern mouth of the river and ascended it to a Russian\r\nvillage. A third boat, with De Long and others, also reached the Lena\r\ndelta, but only two seamen were able to proceed afoot to Bulun, a\r\nfar-away Russian settlement. Melville heard of this, and made haste to\r\nstart out searching parties, but they were too late. De Long and his\r\ncrew had died of exhaustion, and it was not until the next season that\r\ntheir bodies and records were fully recovered.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as we are assured by experts, the results of this\r\nunfortunate expedition were important, physically and geographically.\r\n“They covered some 50,000 square miles of polar ocean, and clearly\r\nindicate the conditions of an equal area between their line of drift\r\nand the Asiatic coast.” De Long believed the Siberian ocean to be\r\na shallow sea, dotted with islands; and his conclusions have been\r\nconfirmed by the admirable scientific work since of Toll, Bunge, and\r\nother Europeans who have explored the Liachoff Islands and other places\r\nin that part of the Arctic realm.\r\n\r\nThe desire for scientific study of the polar world had now become the\r\nmotive for northern research, though men were still ambitious to reach\r\nthe pole; and when Sir George Nares returned from the great British\r\nexpedition of 1875, to tell how the men of the _Alert_ had reached a\r\nwintering-point beyond Robeson Channel, on the west coast of Greenland,\r\nin latitude 82° 27´ N., and that Markham and a sledge-party had gone\r\nabout one degree farther (to 83° 20´ 26´´ N.), greater pride was felt\r\nin this fact, perhaps, than in the careful observations and collections\r\nthat the ships had made. This remained the advance record until the\r\nmemorable feat of Lieutenant Lockwood of the American Greely expedition\r\neight years later.\r\n\r\nThis expedition was one of several acting in concert, according to\r\na scheme suggested by Weyprecht, and perfected at international\r\ncongresses of interested men meeting at Hamburg in 1879 and at St.\r\nPetersburg in 1882. This plan was for the establishment by various\r\ngovernments of a ring of stations as far within the Arctic circle as\r\npracticable, where simultaneous daily observations of the weather,\r\nmagnetic conditions, tides, currents, etc., might be made. The\r\narrangement was begun in the summer of 1883, and observing stations\r\nwere established by Austria on Jan Mayen Island; by Denmark at\r\nGodthaab, Greenland; by Germany on Cumberland Bay, west of Davis\r\nStraits; by Great Britain at Great Slave Lake, Canada; by Holland at\r\nthe mouth of the Yenisei; by Norway at Alten Fjiord, Norway; by Russia\r\nat the mouth of the Lena, and on Nova Zembla; by Sweden on Spitzbergen;\r\nand by the United States at Point Barrow, Alaska, and, farthest north\r\nof all, Lady Franklin Bay, Greenland. Nothing need be said about most\r\nof these stations—all were successful except the Dutch; but to the\r\nlast-named belongs a story that Americans will not forget.\r\n\r\nThe command of the Lady Franklin Bay Station was assigned to Lieutenant\r\nA. W. Greely—not a naval lieutenant, but, like Schwatka, a cavalry\r\nofficer, then assigned to duty in the Signal Service, to which (because\r\nit then supervised the Weather Bureau) the government had intrusted\r\nthis matter. A steamer easily conveyed Greely and his party to Lady\r\nFranklin Bay, and left them there with a good house ready to be set\r\nup, and supplies of all sorts for two years. The prescribed series of\r\nobservations with barometers and thermometers, wind-gages, tide-gages,\r\nmagnetic instruments and all the rest, were at once begun, and two\r\nwinters passed comfortably enough. Dogs and Eskimo drivers had been\r\nobtained, and several journeys were made, of which the most important\r\nwas Lockwood’s advance toward the pole, of which an account has\r\nbeen succinctly supplied by General Greely himself in his admirable\r\n“Handbook of Arctic Discoveries.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCENERY OF GRINNELL LAND AND THE ARCTIC SEA.]\r\n\r\nLieutenant J. B. Lockwood, one of the principal assistants, who had\r\nalready displayed great skill and energy in sledging, even in prolonged\r\ntemperature as low as 81° F. below freezing, undertook a long exploring\r\ntrip up the Greenland coast, to or beyond Cape Britannia. A large\r\nparty went with him at first, but gradually men were sent back, after\r\nestablishing supply-depots. “The journey onward was marked by severe\r\nstorms, rough ice, broken sledges, snow-blindness, minor injuries,\r\nand—worst of all for loaded sledges—soft, deep snow.” At last, some\r\ndistance north of Cape Bryant, all turned back except Lockwood,\r\nSergeant Brainard, and an Eskimo, Christiansen, who, with twenty-five\r\ndays’ rations, pushed on. In five and one half days they had reached\r\nCape Britannia—the farthest north of the Nares expedition—82° 20´\r\nN. Halting here only long enough to study the landscape from its\r\nsummit, and make sure of the remarkable fact that this northern end\r\nof Greenland is free from the ice-cap, whose northern limit is about\r\nlat. 82° N., they rounded a cape, and crossing channel after channel\r\nfilled with ice, which showed that all this district is an archipelago,\r\nreached on May 10th Mary Murray Island, 83° 19´ N. “A violent gale\r\ndelayed them sixty-three hours, the cold exhausting them physically\r\nand the delay mentally. If weather forbade travel, life must be\r\nsustained; but they tasted insufficient food only at intervals of\r\nfifteen, twenty-four, and nineteen hours—the last as clearing weather\r\nmade progress possible. Floes so high that the sledge was lowered by\r\ndog-traces, ice so broken that the ax cleared the way, and widening\r\nwater-cracks in increasing numbers impeded progress. But, despite all\r\nobstacles, they reached, May 13, 1882, Lockwood Island, 83° 24´ N.,\r\n42°, 45´ W., the farthest of their journey, and the highest north [by\r\nland], then or now.”\r\n\r\nThey could see land several miles northeast, which they named Cape\r\nWashington, the highest known land, and toward the north could overlook\r\na polar sea to within three hundred and fifty miles of the pole. Even\r\nhere plants were numerous, and foxes, hares, lemmings, and ptarmigans\r\nexisted. The three heroic travelers returned safely, reaching\r\nheadquarters on June 3d. Another expedition by Lockwood and his two\r\ncompanions explored and located the west coast of mountainous and\r\nglacier-girt Grinnell Land, where the musk-ox and Eskimo hunters range\r\nto the northern border.\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1883 brought no relief-ship, and the plan of escape must\r\nbe put into execution at once. A ship had, in fact, tried to reach\r\nGreely in 1882, but, failing, had left supplies of provisions at Cape\r\nSabine and elsewhere. In 1883 another relief expedition sent north was\r\ndreadfully mis-managed, and finally the ship itself was lost, and,\r\ninstead of leaving supplies, took away all that had been stored at Cape\r\nSabine—the precise point where they were to be needed.\r\n\r\nLeaving Lady Franklin Bay in August in open boats, the party managed,\r\nafter desperate exertions, to get near Cape Sabine, and safely landed\r\non Bedford Pim Island, on the northwestern shore of Smith Sound,\r\nOctober 15, 1883. Of the misery that followed, let Greely himself tell\r\nus:\r\n\r\n  Winter had begun, the polar night was imminent, clothing in rags,\r\n  fuel wanting, and forty days’ rations must tide over 250 days, till\r\n  help could come. The main party put up a hut of rocks, canvas, boat-\r\n  and snow-slabs, while selected men scoured the coasts for caches,\r\n  sought land-game, and watched seal-holes, until utter darkness drove\r\n  all to the hut. Scientific observations were unremittingly made,\r\n  amusements devised, a spring campaign planned, and the returning\r\n  sun found only one dead. Efforts to cross Smith Sound failed, and\r\n  a hunting trip to the west found a new (Schley) land, but no game.\r\n  Finally game came so inadequately that food failed, and one by one\r\n  men died—Jens seal-hunting, and Rice striving to bring in a cache.\r\n  Courage and solidarity continued; and if Greely gave to the maimed\r\n  Ellison double food while it lasted, he did not hesitate to order\r\n  in writing the execution of a man serving under an assumed name of\r\n  Henry, who repeatedly stole sealskin thongs, the only remaining\r\n  food. Flowers, plants, seaweed, and lichens eked out life for the\r\n  six, till June 22, 1884, when the relief-ships, _Thetis_ and _Bear_,\r\n  under Captain W. S. Schley and Commander W. H. Emory, rescued them.\r\n  Records, instruments, and collections were saved to tell the story\r\n  of an expedition that failed not in aught intrusted to it, and whose\r\n  members perished through others.\r\n\r\nTo another piece of brilliant work, that of Lieutenant R. E. Peary, U.\r\nS. N., I can give only a few words, because, like so much else that\r\nmight be said of Arctic researches, it was by land rather than by\r\nsea. By extraordinary courage, skill, and endurance, he twice crossed\r\nnorthern Greenland, showed that it is an island having a northern shore\r\nfree from inland ice in about 82° north latitude, and made stronger\r\nGreely’s conclusion that the lands visited and seen by Lockwood, north\r\nof Cape Britannia, are detached islands. Peary’s work may be said to\r\nhave completed the map of the continental boundary of the Arctic Ocean,\r\nbut he is still busy there.\r\n\r\nOf Nansen, on the contrary, I ought to say as much as I can, because\r\nhis extraordinary voyage in the _Fram_ was perhaps more purely\r\nan examination of the Arctic _Sea_ than any other ever made. Dr.\r\nFridtjoff Nansen was a young Norwegian who had already made his mark\r\nin Greenland, where, soon after 1880, articles began to be found that\r\nhad belonged to the _Jeannette_, and apparently must have drifted\r\nthence from where she was lost off Siberia. This was only a part of the\r\nindications that convinced Dr. Nansen that a current flowed across the\r\nunknown polar space from the neighborhood of Alaska to the northeast\r\ncoast of Greenland, and thence became the great Arctic current that we\r\nrecognize south of Iceland. He argued that if a vessel could find this\r\ncurrent north of eastern Siberia, she would be moved with it until she\r\nemerged into the Atlantic. Incidentally she might drift directly over\r\nthe pole.\r\n\r\nWith this in view, he raised funds to build and equip a small wooden\r\nvessel, furnished with both steam and sails, which was so shaped by\r\nthe roundness of her bottom, and so amazingly braced and strengthened\r\nwithin, that before any “nips” of the ice would crush her, the pressure\r\nwould lift her out of water—as, in fact, happened many times in the\r\ncourse of her wonderful excursion. Nansen chose twelve companions,[3]\r\nand though some of them were educated men of science, others skilful\r\nsea-captains, and others common sailors, all lived and worked together\r\nin one cabin as brothers—the happiest and healthiest lot of men that\r\never ventured into the hyperborean kingdom of desolation.\r\n\r\nLeaving Norway in July, 1893, he struggled through the Kara Sea,\r\nand it was not until late in September, 1894, that he found himself\r\npermanently frozen into the great polar pack, north of the New Siberian\r\nIslands; but even then he was neither so far north nor so far west as\r\nhe hoped to get, and feared that he was south of his supposed current.\r\nFor the story of the strange life led by those thirteen men on that\r\ndrifting ship, safe, abundantly provisioned, dry, warm, lighted by\r\nelectricity (power for the dynamos being gained by a windmill), I can\r\nonly refer you to Dr. Nansen’s book, “Farthest North,” one of the\r\nmost interesting Arctic volumes ever penned. Turning, zigzagging, now\r\nadvancing and again retreating as the constantly moving ice swayed here\r\nand there under the pressure of wind or the dragging of currents, they\r\nnevertheless made a gradual progress westward.\r\n\r\nBy March they had reached a point near the crossing of the 70th\r\nmeridian and 85th parallel, and were still fixed in the ice. Then\r\nNansen, taking with him Lieutenant Johansen, started north by\r\ndog-sledges, in an attempt to reach the pole. They could take very few\r\nsupplies of any sort, and how far north they would be able to travel\r\nmust depend upon their ability to return, not to the _Fram_, which\r\nwould drift on, but to the islands of Francis Joseph Land, far away\r\nsouth. The ice, bad at first, grew worse as they proceeded, being one\r\nlong stretch of hummocks and jagged ditches, with now and then a lane\r\nof open water around which they would toil in misery only to find a\r\nworse one ahead. On April 7th it became certain that they must turn\r\nback. This was “farthest north,” indeed—just above the 86th degree,\r\nhardly 275 miles from the North Pole. Then it was a race against death\r\nby cold, or drowning, or starvation. One by one the dogs were killed to\r\nfurnish food for the remainder. At last, after almost superhuman labors\r\nand thrilling escapes from freezing and drowning and the attacks of\r\nfamished bears, they reached Francis Joseph Land, and spent a winter in\r\na hut made out of stones, earth, and raw walrus hides. The next spring\r\nthey plodded on, and by good chance found the camp of the Jackson\r\nHarmsworth surveying party (which a few days later would have gone away\r\nin its steamer), by whom Nansen and Johansen were carried to Norway in\r\nAugust, 1896.\r\n\r\nA week later the _Fram_ came in, with every one well and hearty, having\r\nemerged from the ice just northwest of Spitzbergen.\r\n\r\nSince Nansen’s return another Scandinavian, S. A. Andrée, with two\r\ncompanions, has disappeared into this same desert of ice and silence,\r\nin a balloon carrying a boat, sledge, tent, and various supplies.\r\nIt was his intention to reach the pole if possible, and to do\r\nwhatever else circumstances permitted. Since his departure, on July\r\n10, 1897, from Spitzbergen, he has not been heard from, except by a\r\npigeon-message two days later.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTH POLE\r\n\r\nWe have followed up to date the history of adventurous and scientific\r\nexploration of the hardly yielding, yet steadily narrowed, circles\r\nof unknown coasts and waters about the North Pole. Let us now see\r\nwhat, thus far, has been done to wrest from the ocean and ice of its\r\nAntarctic antipodes the secrets of the South Pole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PENGUIN-ROOST ON THE BEACHES OF VICTORIA LAND.\r\n\r\nDrawn by the Antarctic explorer Borchgrevink.]\r\n\r\nAlmost three hundred years ago the existence of islands far to the\r\nsouthward of any continents became known to navigators, who were driven\r\nthither by bad weather, and little by little was added to the map of\r\nthis desolate region; but it was not until 1772 that any one went into\r\nthat terrible Antarctic sea for the express purpose of a survey. This\r\nman was the intrepid Captain Cook, and though he sailed a third of the\r\nway around the globe in his efforts to find an entrance through the icy\r\nbarrier, he could never penetrate beyond 71° south latitude, which is\r\nequal to North Cape, or the town of Upernavik, in the Arctic region.\r\nLater captains did little better, until 1841, when Sir James Ross, in\r\nhis ships _Erebus_ and _Terror_,—the same vessels which afterward met\r\ntheir destruction with the ill-fated Franklin expedition,—skirted the\r\nedge of the thick ice that everywhere clothed the land, though it was\r\nmidsummer, and finally reached the base of the southernmost land yet\r\nknown on the globe—a magnificent mountain-chain stretching away to the\r\nsouth from latitude 78° 10´.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous point of all this range of polar mountains, which\r\nrises from an unexplored continent or great island called Victoria\r\nLand, is the volcano Mt. Erebus. It was in eruption at the time of\r\nRoss’s visit, and the explorer tries to tell us of the splendor of its\r\ndisplay when the wide glistening waste of snow and the deep blue of\r\nthe ocean and the starry sky are lit up by the column of fire hurled\r\nthousands of feet heavenward from its crater: but who can picture the\r\ngrandeur of such a scene! This volcano is about 12,400 feet high, and\r\nan extinct neighbor, Mt. Terror, is still higher; while a third peak,\r\nMt. Melbourne, exceeds 15,000 feet in altitude, and like all the rest\r\nis covered with everlasting snow and glaciers from the tempestuous\r\nwater’s edge to its lonely crest.\r\n\r\nMeager as this information is, it is about all we know of the surface\r\nof the globe within the Antarctic circle; and it will be extremely\r\ndifficult to learn much more. In a latitude much farther from the\r\npole than that where in the north vegetation is abundant, and men and\r\nanimals live all the year round, the severity of the Antarctic climate\r\ncuts off all life, and constantly seals the water under a cap of ice.\r\nThe coasts and outlying islands thus far examined appear to be wholly\r\nvolcanic, often composed of nothing but alternate layers of ashes\r\nand ice; but the _Challenger_ staff dredged up from the edge of the\r\nice south of the middle of the Indian Ocean pieces of granite-like\r\nand other rocks, such as belong to land regularly formed; so that\r\nprobably the whole uplift does not consist of volcanic materials; and,\r\nfurthermore, rocks containing fossil plants have been found on some of\r\nthe southernmost islands which show that in past ages—the period of\r\nthe coal deposits—the climate of that end of the world was mild enough\r\nto support forests of trees and, doubtless, a large variety of herbage\r\nand animals. Now most of the coast is unapproachable on account of a\r\nborder of sea-ice, or else cliffs of moving land-ice (glaciers) that\r\ngive off the flat, table-topped icebergs characteristic of the south\r\npolar waters. No trace of any land animal—except visiting sea-fowl—has\r\nbeen found, and only a little of the simplest plants (lichens); nor is\r\nthis surprising when we learn that the highest noonday heat of summer\r\nis only a little above the freezing-point.\r\n\r\nWhy this intense cold and dreadful desolation exists so much farther\r\nfrom the pole in the southern than in the northern hemisphere, I need\r\nhardly explain to you; for you will recall that in the north the\r\ncontinents are so broad as to form almost an unbroken wall about the\r\nnarrow polar sea, confining its cold waters, warming the air by wide\r\nradiation, and guiding the heated flood of the Gulf Stream straight\r\ninto the northern sea. In the southern hemisphere, on the other hand,\r\nan immense breadth of ocean south of latitude 40° is broken by no\r\nland of any account, and the southward flowing warm water from the\r\nequator becomes spread out so thin upon the vast surface that it is\r\nrapidly chilled. It is now generally believed, as has been hinted,\r\nthat the south polar region is a continental mass, deeply buried in an\r\nice-sheet that is ever fed in the center as fast as it wastes away at\r\nthe circumference; for the prevailing winds there tend toward the pole\r\nfrom all sides, and carry loads of moisture to be condensed and fall in\r\nceaseless snows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ICE-CLIFFS AND TABLE-TOPPED BERGS, CHARACTERISTIC OF THE\r\nANTARCTIC REGION.]\r\n\r\nThe Antarctic seas, however, are by no means lifeless, but abound not\r\nonly in fishes,—cod are said to throng in these waters in prodigious\r\nnumbers,—but several varieties of whales, dolphins, and their kin\r\n(which will be described in one of the later chapters), and many kinds\r\nof seals, notably the huge sea-elephant, now becoming rare elsewhere.\r\nThen, too, the Antarctic islands and headlands are the resort of\r\nenormous flocks of certain sea-birds, all different from the Arctic\r\nspecies of their families, which subsist upon the fishes and less\r\ncreatures in the water, and go to the lonely shores outside the ice-cap\r\nonly for rest and to make their nests. Of all these the penguins are\r\nmost numerous and most hardy, and a whole chapter might easily be given\r\nto their quaint appearance and quainter ways. It also appears probable\r\nthat certain migratory birds—especially beach-feeding kinds—regularly\r\nvisit the Antarctic continent in summer from Patagonia, and breed there.\r\n\r\nNow what has been gained by all the expense, exertion, and hardship\r\nof polar exploration? What has been the charm that has led wise and\r\nbrave men to overcome terrific obstacles, and turn again with deeper\r\nand deeper longings toward the mystic icy regions? Lieutenant Maury has\r\ngiven one answer: “There icebergs are framed and glaciers launched.\r\nThere the tides have their cradle: the whales their nursery. There\r\nthe winds complete their circuits, and the currents of the sea their\r\nround in the wonderful system of interoceanic circulation. There the\r\nAurora Borealis is lighted up, and the trembling needle brought to\r\nrest; and there, too, in the mazes of that mystic circle, terrestrial\r\nforces of occult power and vast influence upon the well-being of man\r\nare continually at play.... Noble daring has made Arctic ice and waters\r\nclassic ground. It is no feverish excitement nor vain ambition that\r\nleads man there. It is a higher feeling, a holier motive, a desire\r\nto look into the works of creation, to comprehend the economy of our\r\nplanet, and to grow wiser and better by the knowledge.”\r\n\r\nTo polar explorers we owe not only the discovery of the waters,\r\ncoasts, and archipelagoes that now are accurately outlined upon our\r\nmaps within the Arctic and Antarctic circles, but vast and valuable\r\nproducts—whale-fisheries, seal-fisheries, cod-fisheries, and many other\r\nadditions to the wealth of the world from the sea, while the Arctic\r\nlands have yielded furs and other valuable things in great quantity.\r\nThe study of the people living under those adverse northern conditions\r\nhas been highly instructive, assisting us to reconstruct the life in\r\nthe primitive world; and what we have learned from the records of\r\nthe Arctic rocks has thrown a bright and unexpected light upon the\r\nantiquity of the globe.\r\n\r\nTo studies of the ocean and atmosphere in very high latitudes science\r\nis largely indebted for new facts in magnetism, in the movements of\r\nthe air and causes of climate, in the formation and behavior of ice\r\nand icebergs, in the action of tides and ocean-currents, and in many\r\nother departments of knowledge, all of which have been made of use\r\nespecially to the navigator. Nor has this cost over much. Attention\r\nhas been called to every casualty, and the romantic light of adventure\r\nhas brought into high relief all the hardships and sometimes horrors\r\nof Arctic experience; but the records show that the average of loss\r\nand suffering in Arctic work is not greater than that of ordinary\r\nseafaring and naval careers. Sir Leopold M’Clintock has stated publicly\r\nthat during the thirty-six years when Great Britain was most active\r\nin polar research, she lost only one expedition and 128 persons\r\nout of forty-two successive expeditions sent out, and never lost a\r\nsledge-party out of a hundred that made overland journeys.\r\n\r\nAfter all, no doubt, the best result has been the human heroism\r\ndisplayed, and the human sympathy developed. “There are,” exclaims\r\nProfessor Nourse, “and ever will be, fair fruits born out of such acts\r\nof high aspiration, energy, and fortitude, in those who have gone out,\r\nand in their liberal supporters; exemplars for the lifting up of the\r\ndiscouraged, the education of the young. Certainly volunteers for the\r\npaths of discovery will offer themselves until the fullest additions to\r\nthe domain of science have had their ingathering.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EAGER TO BE FIRST ASHORE IN A NEW LAND.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRAWN BY HOWARD PYLE. ENGRAVED BY M. HAIDER.\r\n\r\nTHE “CONSTITUTION’S” LAST FIGHT.]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[3] The success of this most hazardous venture, although its crew\r\nnumbered _thirteen_, is equal to the success of Columbus’s first\r\nvoyage, although it began on _Friday_! “Luck” has no show when it is\r\npitted against pluck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nWAR-SHIPS AND NAVAL BATTLES\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I—WOODEN WALLS, FROM SALAMIS TO TRAFALGAR\r\n\r\nNaval warfare, properly speaking, begins with the battle of Salamis,\r\n480 B. C., when the Greek fleet, under the guidance of Themistocles,\r\ndestroyed or put to flight a horde of twelve hundred Persian vessels,\r\nand saved Athens, to become the foundation of a strong nation.\r\n\r\nOf these ships at Salamis we know very little, except that they were\r\nlarge, open, or partly open, rowboats, having platforms at the stern\r\nand prow, and perhaps amidships in some cases, where soldiers might\r\nstand and discharge their arrows out of the way of the rowers beneath\r\nthem, or leap aboard the enemy’s boats whenever they could be reached.\r\nThey were, in short, early types of the galleys which subsequently\r\nbecame vessels of war as powerful and serviceable, under the conditions\r\nthey were intended to meet, as are our battle-ships to-day, and\r\nprobably safer as a fighting-place for their crews.\r\n\r\nThat from rowboats rather than from sail-boats should have been\r\ndeveloped the highest type of Mediterranean war-vessel of ancient times\r\nis not surprising when one remembers the light and variable winds of\r\nthat region, the usually smooth seas, the abundance of harbors, and,\r\nabove all, the need of having the vessels under complete control when\r\nall fighting had to be done at short range—chiefly by ramming and\r\nboarding, in fact. It must be remembered, too, that labor was cheap;\r\nand it was considered that the most proper and economical—not to say\r\nhumane—use to which prisoners of war could be put was to make them\r\nrowers in public ships, while enough remained to be sold as slaves to\r\nthe owners of private yachts and privateering galleys. One may imagine\r\na worse fate than this.\r\n\r\nThe earliest war-vessels of the eastern Mediterranean—those of Homer’s\r\ntime, for instance—seem to have been long and rather narrow rowboats,\r\nthe best of which had two tiers of oars, one above the other, the\r\nlower, shorter tier working through oval holes in the side, and the\r\nupper in notches or thole-pins on the gunwale. This left the upper\r\nrowers exposed, and hence such vessels were called _aphract_, or\r\n“unfenced”; and it was not until the Greeks began to become prominent\r\nthat the bulwarks were raised high enough to protect all the rowers,\r\nand war-vessels generally became _cataphract_, or “fenced.”\r\n\r\nIt appears that in very early times war-ships (_biremes_) with not\r\nonly two tiers or banks of oars, but even those (_triremes_) with\r\nthree banks, were used; and the trireme became the type of the most\r\nnumerous and effective vessels of the Greek and Roman navies in their\r\nprime. And as weight and power gradually increased, the crushing power\r\nof collision began to be utilized, and ramming came in as a more and\r\nmore important feature in naval tactics. As the Greeks seem to have\r\nfirst applied these new ideas, it is quite likely that their success at\r\nSalamis was due to these improvements. The arrangement was this:\r\n\r\nFrom the side of the vessel (inside) projected three rows of benches, a\r\nyard apart, horizontally supported at their inner ends by timbers that\r\nslanted toward the stern at such an angle that the top seat of each row\r\nwas exactly above the bottom seat of the row behind it. The oars of\r\nthe top tier (_thranite_) were about fourteen feet long, those of the\r\nmiddle tier (_zygite_) about ten and one half feet, and the lowermost\r\none (_thalamite_) seven and one half feet. Each oar was so nearly\r\nbalanced in its oar-port as to work in the easiest manner, tied there\r\nby a thong and surrounded by a loose sleeve of leather which kept out\r\nthe water. Each one of the lowermost oars was worked by a single man,\r\nthe middle ones by two, and those of the third tier by three or four,\r\nas they were of great length.\r\n\r\nIn later times larger vessels were invented for special\r\npurposes—four-banked (_quadriremes_), five-banked (_quinquiremes_),\r\nand so on, even up to one of forty banks; but as we are unable to\r\nunderstand how it was possible for more than five or six tiers of oars\r\nto be operated, we may leave these extraordinary galleys to special\r\nstudents.[4]\r\n\r\nThe structure of these vessels gave them the greatest strength\r\ncombined with lightness. They had very strong keels and stems, the\r\nlatter peculiarly braced; and along their sides ran waling-pieces, or\r\nfore-and-aft bracing timbers, the lowermost curving inward forward,\r\nuntil they met in front of the stem at the water-line, where they were\r\nbraced by massive timbers, and prolonged into a sharp three-toothed\r\nspur, of which the middle tooth was the longest, reaching out perhaps\r\nten feet. This was covered with metal, usually bronze, and formed the\r\n_beak_.\r\n\r\n“Above it, but projecting less beyond the stem-post, was the\r\n_procmbolion_, or second beak, in which the prolongation of the upper\r\nset of waling-pieces met. This was generally fashioned into the figure\r\nof a ram’s head, also covered with metal.... These bosses, when a\r\nvessel was rammed, completed the work of destruction begun by the sharp\r\nbeak at the water-level, giving a racking blow which caused it to heel\r\nover and so eased it off the beak, releasing the latter before the\r\nweight of the sinking vessel could come upon it.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAMILCAR’S “STAIRWAY OF THE GALLEYS,” AT CARTHAGE.]\r\n\r\nThe stem was often carried up into a curving ornament called the\r\n_acrostolion_, beneath which was a stout-walled deck-space for sailors\r\nor the fighting-men to do their work; and the stern-post similarly\r\nsupported a lofty, richly ornamented structure (_aplustron_), arching\r\nover the officers’ quarters.\r\n\r\nPlatforms extended up and down the center of the ship between the\r\nrowers; and over their heads was a deck having walls or bulwarks where\r\nthe fighting-men and their various “engines” stood. In addition to\r\nthis an external defended gallery for soldiers and boarders usually\r\nran along the outside of the bulwarks above the oars; and awnings of\r\nrawhide were stretched over all to ward off grappling-irons.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten, however, that these galleys also had three\r\npole-masts, and certain sails—probably a huge split lug, with possibly\r\na square topsail on the mainmast, while the fore- and mizzenmasts\r\ncarried lateens. At the top of each stick was a round, protected cage\r\nfilled with archers and slingers—the prototype of our “military mast.”\r\n\r\nNor are the size and force of these Greek and Roman men-of-war to be\r\ndespised. The ordinary trireme had a crew of 200 to 225 men in all, 174\r\nof whom were rowers. The space for cabins and stowage must have been\r\nlittle, but this was of small account, since the war-galleys rarely\r\nundertook long cruises, their tactics being a rush and a sharp fight,\r\nand then a quick return to harbor, where it was the practice to draw\r\nthe lighter galleys up on shore each night. The transportation of the\r\nships across the isthmus of Corinth was not, then, so astonishing a\r\nfeat as it is sometimes called.\r\n\r\nRome’s experience, however, gained in war and in suppressing the\r\nLevantine pirates, taught her to abandon the heavy, many-banked,\r\nunwieldy vessels she had at first developed from Greek and Carthaginian\r\nmodels, and to trust to a much lighter, swifter, and more manageable\r\nstyle, with far less upper structure and rigging, and having only two\r\nbanks of oars. These were called Liburnian galleys. With this change\r\ncame naturally one of tactics, capture by chase and boarding taking the\r\nplace of the earlier attempt to crush by ramming and overriding the\r\nantagonist.\r\n\r\nThe armament comprised not only as many soldiers with bows and javelins\r\nas could find room in action, but various machines of offense and\r\ndefense, such as catapults hurling huge stones or marble grape-shot,\r\nspearheaded rams or huge knives that could be run out against an\r\nenemy’s hull or rigging, arrangements for smashing the enemy’s decks,\r\ncaldrons swung at yard-arms, holding burning pitch or oil to be poured\r\nupon the foe, and often cranes (_corvi_), provided with grapples that,\r\nif one could be made fast, would lift an adversary out of water, and\r\nturn him upside down. No more vivid picture of the life in cruise and\r\nbattle of a Roman man-of-war’s man is known to me than that penned by\r\nGeneral Lew Wallace in “Ben Hur,” but I cannot, of course, transfer\r\nall of it to my pages, as I should like to do, and an extract here and\r\nthere would only spoil the pleasure in store for you in re-reading it\r\nall.\r\n\r\nOf medieval naval warfare in the Mediterranean, the struggles between\r\nthe weak “principalities and powers” that followed the decay of Rome\r\nand lasted for a dozen centuries, we know very little. There is more\r\nobscurity here than even elsewhere in the dim history of the dark\r\nages. It is evident, however, that not much change took place in naval\r\narchitecture. The Byzantine empire succeeded to Rome as mistress of the\r\nseas, and we know that in the ninth century the Byzantine emperors were\r\nstill building biremes (then called _dromones_) armed with tubes for\r\nspouting Greek fire. It should be noted that boats having only a single\r\nbank of oars came now to be called galleys; and this is the first and\r\nproper use of the word, though popularly it is now (or until recently\r\nwas) applied to any large many-oared boat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A COMBAT OF ROMAN GALLEYS (BIREMES).]\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of gunpowder and cannon into naval vessels,\r\nthe ornamental top-works—a picturesque relic of which remains in the\r\nVenetian gondola of to-day—disappeared, as we see when the clear\r\nlight of history begins to shine on the fleets of Venice and Genoa,\r\nwhen these cities were leaders of the world in navigation. Turkey—the\r\nsuccessor of the old Byzantine empire and of the Greek power—was\r\nthen, as now, the great enemy of the west, but in those days it was\r\naggressive. Its fleets were strong and well manned, and they threatened\r\nto cross the Adriatic and fasten the baneful grasp of the Moslem upon\r\nItaly in revenge for the persecution of the Moors in Spain. Perhaps\r\nthey would have done so had not John of Austria, admiral of the\r\nallied navies of Spain, Venice, and Rome, won that great victory in\r\nthe harbor of Lepanto, near the isthmus of Corinth, which destroyed\r\nnearly the whole Turkish fleet, and released fifteen thousand Christian\r\ngalley-slaves. This was in October, 1571, and it saved the West from\r\nbeing overrun by the barbarous East, as exactly fifteen and a half\r\ncenturies before it had been saved near Actium, a famous promontory on\r\nthe northwestern coast of Greece, where Octavius defeated the forces of\r\nAntony and Cleopatra.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether the ships that fought in the later battle\r\nwere much different in either build or rig from those of the earlier\r\nconflict, but their decks no more gleamed with men in armor, and in\r\nplace of catapult, crane, and caldron were cannonades and falconets,\r\narquebuses and hand-grenades. Perhaps, however, they had already taken\r\non more of that long, low shape characterizing later the French and\r\nItalian galleys, common enough in Mediterranean ports up to about one\r\nhundred years ago, which differed mainly from the ancient ones in their\r\nuse of much longer oars or sweeps, balanced upon a sort of extended\r\noutrigger or shelf projecting from the vessel’s side. The galleass of\r\nwhich we hear in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries was a large\r\nwar-ship of this style, which foreshadowed the Atlantic ships, to be\r\nspoken of presently, in having castellated structures fore and aft,\r\nin which were mounted sometimes twenty guns; besides its two or three\r\nlateen-rigged masts, it often had thirty-two sweeps on each side, each\r\nabout forty-five feet long, and handled with a long, slow stroke by\r\nfive or six men—in France mainly convicts “condemned to the galleys.”[5]\r\n\r\nSuch vessels continued to be used by the Spaniards, Maltese, Italians,\r\nand Turks long after they had been abandoned by the French navy,\r\nbut latterly, after the suppression of piracy, in which they were\r\nof especial service, for the conveyance of important personages and\r\noccasions of ceremony rather than for practical service; and in the\r\nstate barge of the Doge of Venice, brought out annually to this day\r\nat the ceremony of re-wedding Venice to the Adriatic, we have a\r\nmagnificent relic of these stately craft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TYPE OF VENETIAN GALLEY.]\r\n\r\nBut such boats were adapted only to the comparatively calm and simple\r\nnavigation of the Mediterranean; and although imitated in the similar\r\nwaters of the eastern Baltic, they never flourished north of Spain.\r\nWhen they gradually disappeared, their successor inside the gates of\r\nGibraltar was the xebec, which began to appear under Arab or Spanish\r\ncontrol in the seventeenth century; this was supposed to be able to\r\nwithstand any weather, and carried from fourteen to twenty-two guns\r\non deck, with small ports for oars between the guns. A picturesque\r\nrelative was the Portuguese muleta.\r\n\r\nThe English liked this kind of vessel on account of its strong sailing\r\nqualities, but when they took it into their own stormy waters they\r\nfound it necessary to raise its sides to fit them for breasting\r\nthe high seas that roll in the open Atlantic or are tossed by the\r\ncontending tides of the English Channel, and developed out of it a\r\nstyle of swift and handy vessel called a frigate.\r\n\r\nDuring all these “middle” ages the northern nations had been sailing\r\nand fighting on the sea as well as the southerners. Stories of sturdy\r\nbattles have come down in tradition and in such chronicles as those of\r\nFroissart; but those old conflicts seem to have produced little change\r\nin ship-building or armament until the experience and wisdom brought\r\nback by the Crusaders began to spread abroad even in the half-savage\r\nNorth, and to produce that revival of learning which by and by was to\r\nmake such striking changes in western Europe; and here the leaders are\r\nEnglishmen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORECASTLE OF THE “GREAT HARRY” (“GRÂCE DE DIEU”).]\r\n\r\nIn those days no national navies, properly speaking, existed in\r\nEngland, France, or northward. When a monarch wished to transport\r\ntroops by water to some other land, or make a naval expedition or\r\ncampaign, he fitted out the ships that belonged to the crown as the\r\nking’s personal property, and compelled his subjects to furnish the\r\nrest, just as his feudal provinces and cities and lords were expected\r\nto equip and bring to his standard any land forces required. It was to\r\nsystematize this method somewhat in England that William the Conqueror\r\n“established the Cinque Ports, and gave them certain privileges on\r\ncondition of their furnishing 52 ships, with 24 men in each, for 15\r\ndays, in cases of emergency.” Now and then, at first, Englishmen were\r\ndisposed to resist the “arrest” of ships, which might easily mean the\r\nruin of their business; and special laws had to be made to quell this\r\nreluctance. Another quaint and significant feature of that practice\r\nwas this: In every fleet one or more ships were set apart as “royal,”\r\nand either the king or his representatives occupied them with court\r\nceremony to carry out the fiction of royal dominion over the sea as\r\nwell as upon the land. It naturally followed in England that after her\r\nnavy had shown its power, and signalized it especially by a brilliant\r\nvictory over Spain in 1380, Edward III should have assumed as an\r\nadditional title “King of the Seas”—an act which had far-reaching\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nDuring the fifteenth century something like an established navy was\r\nforeshadowed; but it was not until the reign of Henry VII, when, at\r\nthe end of the fifteenth century, the whole world was exploring the\r\noceans and awakening to the importance of sea power, that the first\r\nvessel, properly called a national war-ship, was built, equipped,\r\nmanned, and sustained at government expense by England. This was the\r\n_Great Harry_—a floating fortress rather than a ship; for, with her\r\ntowering, overweighted “castles” fore and aft, she was unseaworthy, and\r\ncame near being sunk by a slight rolling which poured the water into\r\nher lower ports.\r\n\r\nBut a better known “_Great Harry_” was the _Henri Grâce de Dieu_, built\r\nby Henry VIII. This king was the real founder of the British navy,\r\nproviding for it many good ships, dock-yards, trained officers, and\r\nregularly enlisted crews. The advantage of this organization and the\r\nsuperiority of English seamanship were demonstrated in the next reign\r\nby the defeat of the Spanish Armada.\r\n\r\nEngland was then at war with Spain, and Philip II thought to end the\r\nmatter by means of the greatest expedition ever heard of. It began to\r\nbe prepared in 1587 under the title of the Most Fortunate Armada,[6]\r\nbut an English squadron under Drake attacked the rendezvous at Cadiz,\r\ndestroyed over one hundred vessels and huge quantities of stores, and\r\nthen so ravaged the neighboring coasts as to delay Spain’s project for\r\na whole season.\r\n\r\nIn midsummer of 1588, however, after an unlucky start, in which it\r\nwas driven back by storms, the dreaded Armada appeared in the English\r\nChannel, like a close flock of huge birds drifting along the British\r\ncoast. It consisted of about 130 ships, seven of which exceeded 1000\r\ntons burden, and numerous small craft, and was armed with nearly 3000\r\ncannon. Its commander was the Duke of Medina Sidonia, who was a most\r\nincompetent man for the post, and it bore, besides nearly 10,000\r\nsailors and galley-slaves, over 10,000 soldiers; but this naval force\r\nwas not intended to attack England until after it had ferried over from\r\nBelgium the Spanish army of the Duke of Parma.\r\n\r\nTo such a force as this England opposed a miserably small fleet—only\r\n34 vessels that could be called ships; but she hastily armed as many\r\nmore smaller ones as she could, amid great fright and excitement, until\r\nfinally Admiral Howard commanded 80 or 90 ships and boats. There was no\r\ndeficiency in his men, however,—the pick of English “sea-dogs” was at\r\nhis call; and among the leaders of the pack were men we have already\r\nmet elsewhere—Francis Drake, John Hawkins, Martin Frobisher, and others.\r\n\r\nWhat a sight it must have been on that August day as these ships,\r\nflying the huge banners of Castile, standing high out of the water,\r\nwith lofty “castles” forward and aft, gaudy with carving and color,\r\nthe light rippling here from silken pennants and flashing there\r\nfrom shining cannon or huge poop-lanterns, moved past the southern\r\nheadlands of England, watched by half-raging, half-fearful crowds! And\r\nhow mystified and indignant must these watching country people have\r\nbeen when Admiral Howard, their only defender, calmly let the Armada\r\nsail by Plymouth, where the English fleet lay hid in the Solent, and\r\nCaptain Drake coolly insisted upon finishing a game of bowls before he\r\nwould go down to his waiting frigate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STYLE OF SHIPS IN THE TIME OF THE ARMADA.]\r\n\r\nBut these captains knew what they were about. In those days, as now,\r\nin fighting with sailing-vessels the advantage is usually with the\r\none who attacks from the windward side; for then he can manœuver his\r\nvessel, whereas his enemy, heading toward the wind, can do so only with\r\ndifficulty if at all, and hence cannot easily take a good position or\r\nescape from a bad one. Howard, therefore, waited until the closely\r\ncrowded squadrons of Spain had passed beyond him up the Channel, when\r\nhe issued from Plymouth harbor, bore down upon their rear from the\r\nwindward, and proceeded, as one of the reports expressed it, to “pluck\r\ntheir feathers.”\r\n\r\nThen began some wonderful days of sea history and naval schooling. The\r\nSpanish vessels were floating castles armed with heavy guns and crowded\r\nwith soldiers armed with muskets and “harquebuses of crock,”—that is,\r\ngreat blunderbusses supported upon a portable rest. They kept in a\r\nclose crowd, like a phalanx of old Swiss infantry, and supposed that\r\nthe English would move against them in another dense raft, and that\r\nthey would fight from deck to deck of grappled ships as if they were on\r\nland.\r\n\r\nBut the English knew better. They had few ships as large—the _Triumph_,\r\n1100 tons, was the biggest—or guns as heavy as the Spaniards’.\r\nInstead of attacking in a solid mass, therefore, they spread out,\r\nhovered on the flanks, darted a ship here and there, fired as they\r\nsaw opportunity, and kept their own vessels out of danger as much as\r\npossible. In the light and variable winds that prevailed, the great\r\ngalleons of the Armada were almost immovable, while the English for\r\nthe most part had smaller, lighter vessels, whose nimbleness and ready\r\nobedience to the helm astonished the Spanish. Standing low in the\r\nwater, these would drive their shot right through the enemy’s hulls,\r\nand make off before the Spaniard could depress his guns enough to do\r\nany damage in return; while the army of musketeers upon whom he had\r\nrelied so strongly had little chance to do anything at all.\r\n\r\nThus for a week the English frigates and armed fishing-boats harassed\r\nthe Armada on its way up the Channel, capturing and sinking many of\r\nthe ships, while losing some of its own, of course, until at last\r\nthe worried and baffled squadron managed to gain the roadstead of\r\nCalais, where the army of the Duke of Parma lay. To carry this army\r\nacross and begin a campaign against London seemed now not only out\r\nof the question, but the safety of the fleet itself was a question;\r\nfor a few days later, when a favorable wind arose, several fire-ships\r\ncame sailing down upon them from the blockading Englishmen outside.\r\nThese fire-ships—an important part of every fleet for two or three\r\ncenturies—were old vessels intended to set fire to an enemy’s ships.\r\nTheir yard-arms were set with great iron hooks, their hulls and\r\nriggings were saturated with oil, their decks loaded with tar-barrels,\r\nand their old guns overloaded, so as to spread destruction in every\r\ndirection by bursting. Then bold crews sailed these grappling monsters\r\nas near the enemy as they dared,—and it must have been a service dear\r\nto the heart of the daring,—set fire to them, lashed their helms, and\r\ngot away in their boats as best they could.\r\n\r\nTo escape these dreadful things the Spaniards were obliged to up-anchor\r\nand put to sea, losing many ships and lives by fire or the wildly\r\nflying cannon-balls, or by going ashore in the effort; and then the\r\nEnglishmen followed them again, like wolves after a herd of buffalo\r\nin winter. The Spaniards dared not go back down the Channel, and\r\nnothing remained to them but the hazardous voyage around the north\r\nof Scotland—a venture for which the towering, unwieldy galleons were\r\nill-fitted. Storms overtook them in the North Sea and on the Atlantic,\r\nand so many were cast away on the Irish coast, where those who reached\r\nthe shore were slain, that hardly half of the proud Armada crept back\r\nto Lisbon and Cadiz.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SEA-FIGHT OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.]\r\n\r\nThis incident was one of the most notable in European history for\r\ntwo reasons: First, historically, it no doubt saved England and her\r\ncolonies from the Inquisition, and all the other depressing and\r\nhorrible burdens that long afterward weighted the papal countries\r\nof southern Europe and their American possessions; and, second, it\r\nreformed naval warfare not only by confirming the value of a regularly\r\norganized national navy, but by showing that the old-fashioned, dense\r\nfleet formation, carrying soldiers to fight as they would do on land,\r\nwas wrong and ineffective.\r\n\r\nBut though Spain had been humbled she was by no means crushed, and\r\nsea-fighting went on a long time before either she, the French, or the\r\nDutch—and the last were the hardest foes—would fully admit England’s\r\nclaim to be sovereign of all the seas around Britain, and strike their\r\nflags whenever they met one of her “king’s ships” in acknowledgment\r\nof it. England asserted that the domain of her crown covered not only\r\nthe lands of England (and much of France), but also “the narrow seas”;\r\nand she defined this domain to include all the Channel waters north\r\nof Cape Finisterre and thence in a square area westward to the middle\r\nof the Atlantic. This was not an assertion: “I can beat the world in\r\nsea-fighting,” but was a legal claim to rule—a declaration that her\r\nlaws extended over that much sea in the same manner that it is now\r\nagreed that the laws of all nations extend to a distance of three miles\r\nfrom their coasts.\r\n\r\nThe whole idea of naval warfare in those days was defense of your\r\nown commerce and attack upon your enemy’s; and at that time any one\r\nyou met under another flag was likely to be your “enemy” if either\r\nparty promised spoils worth a fight. Hence not only did privateering\r\nflourish,—often degenerating into piracy,—not only did all merchant\r\nvessels go heavily armed, but the royal ships were intended principally\r\nfor convoying or guarding merchantmen. This theory, which was only a\r\npart of the generally unsettled condition of that formative period,\r\nkept up a continual state of fighting on the sea, even between peoples\r\nnominally at peace, and of course led again and again to open wars.\r\nThese were almost always popular, especially among the bold sailors\r\nbut poor traders of England, on account of the chances for prizes and\r\nplunder that often more than repaid the expenses and losses of the\r\nconflict; thus the war with the Dutch in 1652-54, in which William Penn\r\nwas a captain, brought in more than _£_6,000,000 worth of captures—more\r\nthan the financial cost of the war.\r\n\r\nAt this time—the first half of the sixteenth century—Holland was the\r\nleading commercial nation of the world. Not only had her merchants\r\nlarge interests of their own in both the East and West Indies, very\r\nextensive fisheries in northern waters, and trading stations in the\r\nAfrican and American coasts, but a large part of the commerce of\r\nother nations was conducted in Dutch ships, including much of England\r\nitself. It was the unrighteous but determined effort to break this up\r\nby any and every means that brought on the second war with Holland,\r\none incident of which was the capture of New Amsterdam (New York); for\r\nfleets no longer stayed close at home, acting mainly as defenders\r\nof coasts, as in the previous century, but now cruised and fought on\r\nthe high seas, as the Spanish had learned in many a hard struggle to\r\nprotect their trading and treasure-ships homeward bound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ATTACKING SPANISH GALLEONS OFF THE AZORES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DRAWN BY WARREN SHEPPARD.\r\n\r\nSPANISH AND FRENCH SHIPS OF THE LINE TAKING POSITION FOR THE BATTLE OF\r\nTRAFALGAR.]\r\n\r\nThis new practice, however, had required a change in ships and their\r\nequipment. The English learned this quicker than any one else. They cut\r\ndown the lofty cabins, increased the height, while reducing the weight,\r\nof masts by inventing jointed topmasts, and replaced the unwieldy\r\nlateens by an arrangement of lofty, quickly handled square sails. By\r\nthe middle of the seventeenth century ocean-going ships had much the\r\nsame appearance as at present,—although far more elaborately ornamented\r\nand bulging aft with stern-galleries,—the massive, high-pooped Spanish\r\ngalleon surviving longest as a relic of the old type. These changes\r\nallowed the armament to be taken from the front and rear of the ship,\r\nwhere it had formerly been mainly placed, there being no room in the\r\nwaist, and allowed it to be distributed equally up and down the ship,\r\nwhich now began to deliver the “broadsides” that formed such a feature\r\nin sea-gunnery before the days of turreted ironclads, and this, with\r\nthe constant improvement in the range and power of the artillery, soon\r\nbrought about ideas of battle formation. The early plan was to provide\r\na large number of ships,—eighty or one hundred on each side in a single\r\naction were not uncommon,—because each was weak, and also because a\r\ngreat number of fighting-men was thought necessary, and then to advance\r\nfrom the windward in a compact mass, and endeavor to close with the\r\nenemy and capture or destroy him by hand-to-hand promiscuous fighting.\r\nOur word _squadron_ means a square, and, as applied to ships, is a\r\nsurvival from those antiquated methods.\r\n\r\nBut when the practice of using fire-ships became common and effective,\r\nand trimmer, more active ships superseded the cumbrous galleasses, it\r\nwas seen that this close formation only exposed a fleet to destruction,\r\nand an open order had to be adopted, with a consequent change of\r\ntactics. Another lesson was, that a sea-fight was a sailor’s battle,\r\nwhere soldiers were out of place, and that to take a great number\r\nof weak ships into action, crowded with men, was only to risk life\r\nunnecessarily. Hence, larger and more heavily armed ships, but fewer of\r\nthem, appear in later engagements; and in place of a bunch of vessels,\r\n“huddled together like a flock of sheep,” at which to shoot, the open\r\norder gave the gunners small and single targets.\r\n\r\nAll these changes combined to enforce the wisdom of meeting an enemy\r\nin a widely spaced line, where the strongest fighting-ships were put\r\nforward, and smaller vessels came up in the rear. Those ahead met the\r\nbattle-ships at the head of the enemy’s column, and the lesser ones, as\r\nthey came up, were paired off against those of their own size, so that\r\nthe battle became a series of equalized duels. Such was the theory of\r\nnaval tactics in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; and so arose\r\nthe term line-of-battle ship, descriptive of such national craft as are\r\nshown on the opposite page.\r\n\r\nThese fine old line-of-battle ships were large and powerful before\r\nthe seventeenth century ended. Thus in the British navy when 1700\r\ncame in there were eight which had from ninety-six to one hundred and\r\nten guns each—fifty-three others carrying more than seventy guns, and\r\ntwenty-three more with more than fifty guns—all at that time regarded\r\nas fit for the line of battle, though a hundred years later nothing\r\nless than a “seventy-four” was so considered. Such were the grandly\r\npicturesque old vessels that won the day at Gibraltar, Copenhagen, and\r\nTrafalgar, and at many another spot where the whole horizon echoed to\r\ntheir thunderous broadsides; but of them all there now remain only a\r\nfew honored hulks in harbors, or a few grand figureheads preserved in\r\ndocks and museums.\r\n\r\nEach navy, however, had a greater number of smaller, more active\r\nvessels, known as frigates, corvettes, sloops-of-war, gun-brigs, etc.,\r\nwhich carried from twenty to forty-four guns, and were the “eyes of the\r\nfleet,” as one old strategist styled them. They answered to what we\r\nshould now call cruisers, and often went on duty in distant parts of\r\nthe world, or in war were scouting about and supporting the main fleet.\r\nThis class was especially cultivated by the United States, as soon as\r\nit began to make a regular navy, at the close of the Revolutionary\r\nWar, and six frigates were built at our six navy-yards during the\r\nlast years of the last century, which were intended and proved to\r\nbe separately “superior to any single European frigate of the usual\r\ndimensions” in speed, manœuvering, and fighting power, in proportion to\r\ntheir weight of ordnance. Three of them (_Constellation_, _Congress_,\r\nand _Chesapeake_) mounted thirty-six guns, and three (_United\r\nStates_, _President_, and _Constitution_) forty-four guns each—mainly\r\n24-pounders; and all gave so good an account of themselves, as ships,\r\nthat the high compliment was paid us of their being carefully imitated\r\nby foreign naval constructors.\r\n\r\nThis is not a naval history, so that I am not concerned to tell of all\r\nthe glorious or inglorious work of the navies of Europe in obtaining\r\nand holding, or failing to get and keep, trade routes open and\r\nterritorial possessions intact in various parts of the world. During\r\nthe seventeenth and eighteenth and far into the nineteenth century,\r\nthere was no time when some nations were not fighting on the sea if not\r\non land; and much of the time _all_ the maritime nations were hard at\r\nit, turning their guns to-day on the allies of yesterday, and fighting\r\nshoulder to shoulder with them the next season against some friend of\r\nthe year before.\r\n\r\nA few of the most famous battles ought to be spoken of, however, as\r\nillustrating the methods and development of naval warfare, and because\r\nwe now recognize that their consequences were far-reaching.\r\n\r\nIn the wars which broke out toward the close of the eighteenth century\r\ndue to Napoleon’s ambition to rule the world, Great Britain found\r\nherself engaged in a struggle not only with France, but really with\r\nthe whole world, for the command of the seas that washed the western\r\ncoast of Europe. The only sign of friendship to England from the Baltic\r\nto Gibraltar was in the doubtful neutrality of Portugal. England had\r\nto abandon the Mediterranean, and devote herself to facing the allied\r\npowers against her outside the Gates of Hercules as best she could.\r\nIn 1797 she made a beginning by crushing a fleet of Dutch ships off\r\nCamperdown (Holland), and a Spanish fleet off Cape St. Vincent; but,\r\nthough both were great battles, neither had any lasting effect; and\r\nin spite of them Napoleon planned his celebrated invasion of England\r\nfor the following year, supposing that by his expedition to Egypt,\r\nthreatening England’s East Indian possessions, he would draw away so\r\nmuch of the British navy that he and his allies could put an army\r\nacross the English Channel unhindered. I need not say that his invasion\r\nof England never was even attempted; but for a time his fleet did hold\r\ncommand of the Mediterranean—a state of things to which an end was put\r\nby England’s most famous naval hero, Horatio Nelson.\r\n\r\nA long series of brilliant exploits had given Nelson fame, and the\r\nvigorous accounts of them he used to send home helped his great\r\npopularity. A large part of his service had been in American waters.\r\n\r\nIn 1798 Nelson was a rear-admiral, and was sent to the Mediterranean\r\nafter the French fleet, which, having convoyed Napoleon’s army to\r\nits landing at Alexandria, was ready for new operations. It is\r\ncharacteristic of the slow and almost useless methods of gaining\r\nintelligence in those days, that from early June to the end of July\r\nNelson searched for this flotilla, and was unable to get more news of\r\nit than an occasional rumor that it had been at some place or other\r\ndays or weeks before. The French knew no more as to the movements of\r\ntheir pursuers, yet the fleets were twice within a few miles of each\r\nother. This was Nelson’s first independent command, and his patience\r\nand nerves were nearly worn out by anxiety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHEN DECATUR WAS A MIDSHIPMAN.]\r\n\r\nAt last, on the first day of August, the English almost stumbled on the\r\nFrench at anchor in the Bay of Aboukir, among the mouths of the Nile,\r\nbetween Alexandria and Rosetta—a shallow roadstead full of shoals and\r\nrocks, for which Nelson had neither chart nor pilot.\r\n\r\nIn the interior of this bay lay the Napoleonic squadron, under Admiral\r\nBrueys, in such fancied security that a large part of the crews was\r\nashore, and some of the ships unprepared for a battle when the British\r\nappeared. It was anchored in line of battle, however, and consisted\r\nof thirteen ships of the line, the central one being the flagship\r\n_Orient_, having 120 guns, and probably the largest and most complete\r\nwar-ship then afloat. On each side of her were the _Franklin_ and\r\nthe _Tonnant_, of 80 guns each, and none of the others were greatly\r\ninferior.\r\n\r\nThe British had also thirteen ships, but none was the equal of the\r\nbest French, and one of them did not engage in the attack at all.\r\nKnowing nothing of the harbor, and aware that all his ships drew\r\nmuch water,—perhaps thirty feet,—Nelson had to make a long and very\r\ncautious detour, throwing the lead every moment and feeling his way\r\nin. It was then late in the afternoon, and half-past six before the\r\n_Goliath_, leading the column, got near enough to attract the French\r\nfire. Replying, but not halting, the _Goliath_, followed closely by the\r\n_Zealous_ and _Orion_, made for the head of the line, and then with\r\na daring unrivaled, for there was barely enough water to float their\r\nkeels, these ships slowly turned around the foremost French vessel and\r\ndropped their anchors in the rear of the enemy’s line. The other ships,\r\nas they came up, ranged alongside the front of the French, and the\r\ndeepening twilight resounded with such a roar of broadsides as never\r\nwill be heard again.\r\n\r\nIn the darkness and smoke an English seventy-four, the _Bellerophon_,\r\nhad engaged the monstrous _Orient_, and in a short time had been\r\ncrushed; all her masts were swept out of her, two hundred of her people\r\nwere killed and wounded, and she drifted out of action. But nearly the\r\nsame fate had by that time overtaken the French _Guerrière_, for the\r\n_Theseus_ had coolly placed herself where she could rake the anchored\r\nship and tear her to pieces. The moment the _Bellerophon_ drifted\r\noff, however, her place was taken by two newly arrived frigates, and\r\nthe _Orient_ presently found herself the target of three ships which\r\nslowly but surely were cutting her to pieces in spite of her tremendous\r\nresistance. Her admiral had been killed on her deck, where half her\r\nofficers and men lay dead or wounded, when it was suddenly seen that\r\nshe was on fire, and the whole battle was instinctively suspended to\r\nwatch the magnificent spectacle, save where some still poured in shot\r\nand shell to prevent the French crew from extinguishing the flames.\r\n\r\nPowerless either to save their ship or launch their boats, the remnant\r\nof the _Orient’s_ crew could only fling themselves into the water and\r\ntrust to the mingled boats of friends and foes to pick them up. The\r\nships nearest slipped their cables, and tried to edge away out of\r\ndanger as the flames enveloped the towering masts, burning with amazing\r\nfierceness in the tarred rigging and lighting up the desert for miles\r\ninland, while the hull became a furnace. Suddenly, at a quarter before\r\nten, a volcano-like explosion tore the glowing old battle-ship asunder,\r\na torrent of burning fragments was hurled aloft,—with how many dead\r\nheroes, no one knows,—and double darkness closed over the appalling\r\nscene. Then the black waves were lighted anew by the flash of cannon\r\nand musketry, and the battle went on until daylight before the last of\r\nthe French vessels had been conquered, while two of them had managed\r\nto steal away. Of the other eleven one had been burned and sunk, three\r\nhad gone ashore, where one burned, and the remainder had been crushed\r\ninto surrendering. The English did not lose a single vessel, for even\r\nthe dismantled _Bellerophon_ could float, and their loss in men was far\r\nless than that of the French.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DRAWN BY WARREN SHEPPARD.\r\n\r\nTHE “THESEUS” ATTACKING THE “GUERRIÈRE.”]\r\n\r\nHistorians tell us that this victory was the grandest naval success\r\non record. Nelson himself said that victory was too weak a term—it\r\nwas a catastrophe. It put an end at once to Napoleon’s campaign in\r\nEgypt, and to all his designs against India. It gave the command of the\r\nMediterranean to England, emboldened Turkey and Russia to recover the\r\nIonian Islands, gave Naples a chance to assert herself, and aroused\r\nAustria and Russia to resist by armies Napoleon’s aggressions, so\r\nthat from this battle dates his downfall. Its influence soon reached\r\nthe United States, and caused it to break through its neutrality\r\nand begin upon the sea that naval war with France of which we hear\r\nvery little nowadays, but which gave to our own naval record such\r\nglorious incidents as Truxton’s battles in the _Constellation_ with\r\n_L’Insurgente_ and _La Vengeance_, and Captain Little’s capture, in the\r\ncorvette _Boston_, of the French sloop-of-war _Le Berceau_.\r\n\r\nNelson remained in the Mediterranean for some years, by no means idle,\r\nand then did service of extraordinary value elsewhere, as at the battle\r\nof Copenhagen, which in a single remarkable conflict put an end to\r\na northern conspiracy against England, and saved her a vast deal of\r\ntrouble; but his final service was the most momentous of all, at any\r\nrate for the fortunes of Great Britain alone, and this was the winning\r\nof the battle of Trafalgar.\r\n\r\nIn 1805 Napoleon had prepared for another grand invasion of England,\r\nand with great skill had gathered a fleet of allied French and Spanish\r\nvessels, which was to protect and coöperate with the strong army he\r\nproposed to land along the Kentish shores. This fleet was commanded by\r\nAdmiral Villeneuve, and assembled at Cadiz, where, in October, 1805,\r\nit was being watched by an English fleet, commanded by Nelson and\r\nCollingwood, consisting of thirty-three ships of the line; twenty-seven\r\nof these were present when, on the morning of the 21st, the allies,\r\ntwenty-nine battle-ships strong, came sailing out, hoping to avoid\r\nbattle if possible. This, Nelson was resolved, should not happen; and\r\ndividing his forces into two columns, he made at them in such a way as\r\nto strike their line (then off Cape Trafalgar) in the middle of its\r\ncrescent. The wind was very light, and an hour or more elapsed before\r\neven the heads of the line struck the enemy, so that there was plenty\r\nof time to make every preparation, and there was constant instruction\r\nby signaling from Nelson’s flagship _Victory_. Then at the last moment,\r\nwhen the first gun was ready to be fired, there rose upon the signal\r\nhalyards of the _Victory_ the message that, received with ringing\r\ncheers, has been an inspiration to patriots the world around ever since\r\nsince—\r\n\r\n  ENGLAND EXPECTS EVERY MAN WILL DO HIS DUTY.\r\n\r\nA few moments later Collingwood in the _Royal Sovereign_, and Nelson\r\nin the _Victory_, were in the thick of the foreign fleet, which\r\nawaited them in disorderly array, but closed about these two, bent\r\nupon destroying them if possible before any others could come up. The\r\nfury of the duels that ensued, where ships were mixed in disorder, and\r\nsometimes three or four against one, passes adequate description. None,\r\nperhaps, fared worse than the _Belle Isle_, a large English two-decker\r\nthat was the first to reach the scene after the _Royal Sovereign_, and\r\nto draw off some of the fire that threatened to pulverize Collingwood’s\r\nship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  England expects every man will do his D U T Y\r\n\r\n  DRAWN FROM THE MODEL IN THE GREENWICH MUSEUM.\r\n\r\nNELSON’S SIGNAL.]\r\n\r\nThe wreckage and suffering on other ships were almost as great. The\r\nvery first broadside of the _Royal Sovereign_, taking the _Santa Ana_,\r\nstruck down 400 out of the 1000 persons aboard; and the _Sovereign_\r\nherself soon lost every mast. The _Santissima Trinidada_, a Spanish\r\nfour-decker, and the largest ship then afloat, was reduced to a wreck,\r\nand a dozen others lost a part or all of their masts. As for the\r\n_Victory_, she was always in the thick of it, receiving at one time the\r\nconcentrated fire of seven hostile battle-ships, yet was not too much\r\ndisabled to be manœuvered. Her captain’s aim was to engage directly\r\nwith the French flagship _Bucentaure_, but she was closely attended\r\nby three other large ships, and difficult to reach. Nevertheless, the\r\n_Victory_ finally got across her stern, and from a few yards distance\r\npoured in a broadside which, sweeping the whole length of her interior,\r\ndismounted twenty guns, and killed and wounded 400 men. As she passed\r\non, returning the fire of the other vessels near by, she was closely\r\nfollowed by the _Temeraire_, the second English ship, which had already\r\nbecome almost unmanageable; and a lifting of the smoke showed her\r\nsmashing a little French frigate, the _Redoubtable_, which, by and by,\r\nwas captured after almost every man had been killed, and she was in a\r\nsinking condition. The astonishing resistance of this little vessel,\r\nand the damage she did by soldiers with muskets crowded in her tops\r\nand firing down upon the decks of the English ships, form one of the\r\nmost noteworthy incidents of naval history; and it is not too much to\r\nsay that she inflicted upon Great Britain as great harm as all the\r\nrest of the allies put together, for it was a musket-ball from the\r\nmizzentop of the _Redoubtable_ that struck down, early in the action,\r\nthe great Nelson himself. He seemed to have had a feeling, even before\r\nleaving England, that he would not survive this campaign, and knew his\r\nwound was mortal the instant it was received. He was carried below,\r\nand remained alive and conscious about three hours, eagerly listening\r\nto reports of the progress of the fight, and rejoicing at last in a\r\nknowledge of victory. His last words, murmured again and again, with\r\nhis failing breath, seemed an answer to his signaled injunction, for\r\nthey were: “_Thank God I have done my duty._”\r\n\r\n  Other men [writes Captain Mahan] have died in the hour of victory,\r\n  but to no other has victory so singular and so signal stamped the\r\n  fulfilment and completion of a great life’s work. “Finis coronat\r\n  opus” has of no man been more true than of Nelson. Results momentous\r\n  and stupendous were to flow from the annihilation of all sea power\r\n  except that of Great Britain, which was Nelson’s great achievement;\r\n  but his part was done when Trafalgar was fought, and his death in the\r\n  moment of completed success has obtained for that superb victory an\r\n  immortality of fame which even its own grandeur could scarcely have\r\n  insured.\r\n\r\nNo such fleet actions as this ever occurred in North American waters\r\nin the time of the “old navy,” though there was plenty of cruising\r\nand fighting up and down the coast and in the West Indies. The United\r\nStates had made its new flag respected before the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, but it was done mainly in European waters, where that\r\nmarvelous captain, Paul Jones, had been defying enemies to the point of\r\nrashness.\r\n\r\nPaul Jones was the first man to hoist our national ensign (the\r\nrattlesnake flag) on an American ship, and again the first to hoist\r\nthe stars and stripes, and was the ranking officer of the continental\r\nnavy. He records that “in the Revolution he had twenty-three battles\r\nand solemn rencounters by sea; made seven descents in Britain and her\r\ncolonies; took of her navy two ships of equal and two of far superior\r\nforce,” and so on. It is true that he alone of his day steadfastly\r\nrefused to acknowledge England’s supremacy of the seas; that the flag\r\nof the United States alone was never struck to Great Britain except\r\nunder force of honorable combat; and that on the ships commanded by\r\nPaul Jones it was never struck at all!\r\n\r\nEvery Yankee school-boy knows of the terrible fight of the crazy old\r\nsloop-of-war _Bon Homme Richard_ against the _Serapis_, a new English\r\n50-gun frigate in the North Sea, in which a sinking and burning and\r\nshot-riddled vessel, able after the first broadside to bring only\r\nthree or four small guns into practice, conquered and captured her\r\ntwice-greater antagonist. It is not a story one can tell in a few\r\nwords, but it was a deed that is regarded in naval annals as among the\r\nmost extraordinary in the history of the world, and it won for the new\r\nrepublic a credit in Europe that was of vast benefit to it and all its\r\nwandering citizens.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain, though humiliated, had not been seriously hurt by the\r\nloss of two or three ships out of her six hundred, and she still tried\r\nto enforce against the rising naval power on the west side of the\r\nAtlantic the subservience which she received along its eastern shores.\r\nIt took the form of asserting her right to stop and board any American\r\nvessel, governmental or private, and seize and impress into her own\r\nservice any British subject found serving in the crew. This always met\r\nwith protest and resistance, and at last became so galling that in 1812\r\nthe United States declared war against Great Britain’s might rather\r\nthan continue to submit to it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Drawn from Life by S. DeKoster Decʳ.8 1800, Engraved by Jd. Stow._\r\n\r\nBARON NELSON OF THE NILE.]\r\n\r\nThis might gradually overcame us, and British fleets sailed up and down\r\nour coasts unhindered, but not until the enemy had been surprised by\r\nmany harder knocks than they anticipated, and had learned one thing for\r\ncertain,—that while man for man the Yankees were equally good seamen\r\nand fighters, they were better ship-builders, and could teach lessons\r\nin that art which their enemies were not above learning: and finally we\r\nwon by sheer force of victories at sea.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of the six frigates which were used in that war,\r\nas admittedly the best of their kind in the world. Except the unlucky\r\n_Chesapeake_, which was rashly carried unprepared into the fatal action\r\nagainst the _Shannon_, where Lawrence lost his life, but won undying\r\nfame in the memory of his countrymen by his “Don’t give up the ship,”\r\nall did glorious work. Thus, the _United States_ under Decatur reduced\r\nto a wreck off Madeira, and brought as a prize to New York, the British\r\n44-gun frigate _Macedonian_ in October, 1812, itself remaining almost\r\nuninjured,—a victory due to superior seamanship and gunnery.\r\n\r\nThe same skill, using a ship of superior sailing power, accounted\r\nlargely for the splendid victory of the United States sloop-of-war\r\n_Wasp_ (18 guns), a week earlier, near Bermuda, in an encounter with\r\nthe British sloop _Frolic_ (19 guns), where in three quarters of an\r\nhour the _Frolic_ was totally dismasted and reduced to a rolling\r\nwreck, with ninety killed or wounded out of a crew of one hundred and\r\nten, while the _Wasp’s_ loss was only ten. A British seventy-four\r\nthen came up and captured both the victor and her prize; but eighteen\r\nmonths later a second _Wasp_, by reason of her better gunnery, cut to\r\npieces at different times two other ships with comparatively small\r\ninjury to herself. Nor could the _President_ have given so good an\r\naccount of herself in her unfortunate encounter with the _Belvidera_,\r\nand again when chased and finally captured by the squadron led by the\r\n_Endymion_, had not her sailing qualities and gunnery been of so high\r\nan order—qualities which also distinguished the American fleets on Lake\r\nErie and Lake Champlain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “FROLIC” REDUCED TO A WRECK BY THE FIRST “WASP”\r\n(1812).]\r\n\r\nBut the honors of that brilliant naval war belonged chiefly, after all,\r\nto the _Constitution_—“Old Ironsides,” as the people loved to call\r\nher,—which is enshrined in the history and hearts of the United States\r\nas Nelson’s _Victory_ is in those of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe _Constitution_ was the finest, perhaps, of the United States\r\nfrigates, and a favorite ship with commanders, yet her fame began with\r\nher success in running away, Broke’s British squadron chasing her three\r\nnights and two days, only to lose her after all. The winds were so\r\nlight that she sent out her boats to help the sails urge her forward.\r\nIt was only a few days after that (August 19, 1812) that Commodore\r\nIsaac Hull, cruising in search of the British vessel _Guerrière_ (the\r\nsame that had been captured from the French in the battle of the Nile,\r\nand again dismasted at Trafalgar), overhauled her off the coast of\r\nNewfoundland. The London newspapers had not only been sneering at the\r\n_Constitution_ as “a bundle of pine boards sailing under a bit of\r\nstriped bunting,” but Captain Dacres had sent a boastful challenge\r\nto Hull to meet him and see what would happen. The vessels, though\r\nnominally of different rate, were actually in close equality, and\r\nboth crews were eager for a fair fight. It was already well along in\r\nthe afternoon, and the sea was rough, but Hull would not reply to the\r\nenemy’s fire until he was within pistol-shot, then his broadside opened.\r\n\r\n  “Fifteen minutes after the contest began,” to quote Lossing’s lively\r\n  account, “the mizzenmast of the _Guerrière_ was shot away, her\r\n  mainyard was in slings, and her hull, spars, sails, and rigging were\r\n  torn to pieces. By a skilful movement, the _Constitution_ now fell\r\n  foul of her foe, her bowsprit running into the larboard quarter of\r\n  her antagonist. The cabin of the _Constitution_ was set on fire by\r\n  the explosion of the forward guns of the _Guerrière_, but the flames\r\n  were soon extinguished. Both parties attempted to board, while the\r\n  roar of the great guns was terrific. The sea was rolling heavily,\r\n  and would not permit a safe passage from one vessel to the other.\r\n  At length the _Constitution_ became disentangled, and shot ahead of\r\n  the _Guerrière_, when the mainmast of the latter, shattered into\r\n  weakness, fell into the sea. The _Guerrière_, shivered and shorn,\r\n  rolled like a log in the trough of the billows. Hull sent his\r\n  compliments to Captain Dacres, and inquired whether he had struck\r\n  his flag. Dacres, who was a ‘jolly tar,’ looking up and down at the\r\n  stumps of his masts, coolly and dryly replied: ‘Well, I don’t know.\r\n  Our mizzenmast is gone, our mainmast is gone,—upon the whole you may\r\n  say we _have_ struck our flag.’”\r\n\r\nToo completely wrecked to be of any further use, the historic old ship\r\nwas set on fire and blown up, and so ended her pride and her story.\r\nHull lost only fourteen men killed and wounded, while the British lost\r\nseventy, dead, and all the survivors prisoners. This calamity, on the\r\nheels of similar successes elsewhere for the “bit of striped bunting,”\r\nspread consternation throughout Great Britain not only, but in the\r\nother European monarchies, for it presaged the rise of a new power to\r\nbe reckoned with, where novel and superior instruments and methods of\r\nwarfare opposed uncalculated forces to the old régime.\r\n\r\nThis conviction was enforced upon Europe anew only four months later\r\nby the _Constitution_ overtaking and crushing in West Indian waters\r\nthe 38-gun frigate _Java_, which also was burned to the water’s edge,\r\nbecause the wreck was not worth saving; and again the British loss was\r\nmany times greater than the American. Captain William Bainbridge, who\r\nhad distinguished himself in the Mediterranean, was her commander.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “CONSTITUTION” CHASED BY CAPTAIN BROKE’S SQUADRON\r\n\r\nThe ports on the upper deck aft were roughly cut to meet the emergency.\r\nThe sailors in the rigging threw water from buckets upon the sails to\r\nmake them hold better the faint breeze, and below hose pipe was used to\r\nthe same purpose. During the three days’ chase boats were sent out to\r\ntow, and kedge-anchors were used to warp the ship forward.]\r\n\r\nVarious successes marked her career for the next two years, until,\r\nunder the command of Captain Charles Stewart, she had her memorable\r\nadventure off Madeira, in which she engaged with the two British ships\r\n_Cyane_, thirty-six guns, and _Levant_, eighteen guns, and captured\r\nboth, with a loss of only three men killed and twelve wounded.\r\nStewart set sail with his prizes and prisoners for Porto Praya,\r\nwhence he purposed sending his prisoners to New York in a captured\r\nmerchantman. Reaching there on March 10th, he was next day busy at\r\nthese arrangements, when the topsails of several men-of-war were seen\r\nentering the harbor through the prevailing fog. Having no trust that,\r\nif these were British, their commanders would respect the courtesies\r\nof a weak neutral port, Stewart felt that his only chance was to try to\r\nrun away in the fog, and made immediate preparations to do so, sending\r\nword to the _Levant_ and _Cyane_ to follow. Being discovered by the\r\nstrangers—three large British frigates—at the outlet of the harbor,\r\ntheir escape immediately became a question of seamanship and sailing.\r\nHere the Americans showed their superiority, and effectually dodging\r\nboth the ships and the cannon-balls of the pursuers, the _Levant_ got\r\nback under the protection of the guns of the fort at Porto Praya, while\r\nthe _Constitution_ and _Levant_ fairly outsailed the frigates and\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\nIn 1830 brave Old Ironsides was condemned as worn out, and ordered\r\nto be sold. But, as a similar sad fate overtaking the “Fighting\r\n_Temeraire_” had been made the occasion of an immortal painting\r\nby Turner, and so, perhaps, had caused Nelson’s still more famous\r\nbattle-ship _Victory_ to be preserved in the harbor of Portsmouth\r\nas a shrine of naval inspiration, so the obloquy that menaced the\r\n_Constitution_ now fired the heart of a young poet to write a\r\npassionate appeal to patriotism. Who does not know Dr. Holmes’s ringing\r\nstanzas?—\r\n\r\n  Oh, better that her shattered hulk\r\n    Should sink beneath the wave;\r\n  Her thunders shook the mighty deep,\r\n    And there should be her grave.\r\n  Nail to the mast her holy flag,\r\n    Set every threadbare sail,\r\n  And give her to the God of Storms,\r\n    The lightning and the gale!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOMEWARD BOUND.]\r\n\r\nThe country caught the spirit, and such a cry of protest went up that\r\nthe vandalism was stayed, and Old Ironsides was again repaired—hardly\r\nanything but her ornaments was now left of the original structure—and\r\ntook several cruises, one of which was in carrying wheat to\r\nfamine-stricken Ireland. Later she was used as a school-ship, but\r\nfinally became worthless even for that, and in 1895 the question\r\narose whether she should be broken up at the Brooklyn navy-yard or\r\ntowed around to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and there laid up in a\r\nline with the _Macedonian_ and a few other ancient hulks that were\r\nrotting quietly away in honorable age, and have now wholly disappeared.\r\nSentiment dictated the latter course, and, with a crew aboard, prepared\r\nto take to their boats at a moment’s notice, the leaking and crazy old\r\nwarrior, stately even yet, and sadly saluted by every fort and vessel\r\nshe passed, crept around to her last berth at Kittery Point. She is the\r\nlast and the most glorious representative of the “old navy.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TYPES OF BATTLE-SHIPS—1890 AND 1800.]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] An example of the so-called forty-bank galley is illustrated, so\r\nfar as its forward end will show it, in the picture of the ship of\r\nPtolemy Philopator, on page 43. The forty “banks” appear to be groups\r\nof oars in a few tiers.\r\n\r\n[5] Three other terms of similar sound need explanation. The _galiot_\r\nwas a small, fast galley of the Levant. The _gallivat_ was a large,\r\nswift, two-masted, armed sail-boat used by Malay pirates. The _galleon_\r\nwas any Spanish ship sailing to and from the Spanish main; hence,\r\nespecially a treasure-ship.\r\n\r\n[6] It was known later as the Invincible Armada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n(_Continued_)\r\n\r\nWAR-SHIPS AND NAVAL BATTLES\r\n\r\nPART II—THE PRESENT ERA OF STEAM AND STEEL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe introduction of steam made little difference in naval affairs at\r\nfirst, so far as either strategy or tactics are concerned, although it\r\nchanged the conditions of naval action in two principal ways and in\r\nmany minor ones. Ships could now, like the early galleys, be placed\r\nin any position the commander pleased, and, unlike galleys, this\r\neffort could be sustained a long time, for engines do not tire out\r\nlike human arms. On the other hand, ships propelled by steam needed to\r\nreturn to port at frequent intervals to obtain coal, and naval powers\r\nfound it necessary to provide, either by possession or treaty, safe\r\ncoaling-stations in various parts of the world for the use of their\r\ncruising fleets.\r\n\r\nThe first steam war-ships were naturally fitted with side\r\npaddle-wheels; but as soon as the screw-propeller came into use the\r\nnavy was quick to adopt it. “By its use the whole motive power could\r\nbe protected by being placed below the water-line. It interfered much\r\nless than the paddle with the efficiency and handiness of the vessel\r\nunder sail alone, and it enabled ships to be kept generally under\r\nsail. Great importance was attached to this, as the handling of a ship\r\nunder sail was justly thought an invaluable means of training both\r\nofficers and men in ready resource, prompt action, and self-reliance.”\r\nFor this reason masts and sails were retained long after they were\r\nadmitted to be detrimental to the fighting qualities of battle-ships.\r\nNaval reformers had to wait until the last generation of “old salts,”\r\ntrained on “blue water,” had died off, and their scornful sneers at\r\n“tea-kettle” seamanship had been silenced in the only way possible,\r\nbefore they could persuade governments to build or men to serve in\r\nthe new style of vessels. In truth, the transition from the fighting\r\nmachinery and methods that prevailed until, say, the bombardment of\r\nAcre, in 1840, to those that decided the inferiority of China in her\r\nstruggles with Japan at the Yalu and elsewhere, was rapid enough to\r\nmake even a sea-dog dizzy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “KEARSARGE” GETTING INTO POSITION TO RAKE THE\r\n“ALABAMA” AT THE CLOSE OF THE COMBAT.]\r\n\r\nExcellent types of the war-steamers, intermediate between the old two-\r\nand three-deckers and the sailless “ironclads” that followed, were\r\nthose two actors in that most glorious sea-fight of the American Civil\r\nWar—the _Kearsarge_ and _Alabama_.\r\n\r\nIn this great fight, which took place a few miles off the harbor of\r\nCherbourg, France, one beautiful summer Sunday (June 19th) in 1864,\r\nmuch the same tactics prevailed as in any one of the earlier ocean\r\nduels. As the _Alabama_ came on she began firing the two-hundred-pound\r\npivot-rifle forward, which was her main gun, while the _Kearsarge_ was\r\nyet a mile away. The latter waited a little before replying, but only a\r\nfew moments elapsed before both were near enough and hard at it, each\r\ndoing its best to get a position ahead of its antagonist for raking,—a\r\ndisadvantage which the other steadily avoided; and this caused them\r\nto follow one another about in advancing circles, of which seven were\r\ndescribed before the end came.\r\n\r\nWe have a story of the battle as seen from the deck of the _Kearsarge_,\r\nwritten by her surgeon, who had little to do except observe the\r\nconflict.\r\n\r\n  The _Kearsarge_ gunners [he tells us] had been cautioned against\r\n  firing without direct aim, and had been advised to point the heavy\r\n  guns below rather than above the water-line, and to clear the deck\r\n  of the enemy with the lighter ones. Though subjected to an incessant\r\n  storm of shot and shell, they kept their stations and obeyed\r\n  instructions.\r\n\r\n  The effect upon the enemy was readily perceived, and nothing could\r\n  restrain the enthusiasm of our men. Cheer succeeded cheer; caps were\r\n  thrown in the air or overboard; jackets were discarded; sanguine of\r\n  victory, the men were shouting as each projectile took effect: “That\r\n  is a good one!” “Down, boys!” “Give her another like the last!” “Now\r\n  we have her!” and so on, cheering and shouting to the end.\r\n\r\n  After exposure to an uninterrupted cannonade for eighteen minutes\r\n  without casualties, a sixty-eight-pounder Blakely shell passed\r\n  through the starboard bulwarks below the main rigging, exploded\r\n  upon the quarterdeck, and wounded three of the crew of the after\r\n  pivot-gun. With these exceptions, not an officer or man received\r\n  serious injury. The three unfortunates were speedily taken below,\r\n  and so quietly was the act done, that at the termination of the\r\n  fight a large number of the men were unaware that any of their\r\n  comrades were wounded. Two shots entered the ports occupied by the\r\n  thirty-twos, where several men were stationed, one taking effect in\r\n  the hammock-netting, the other going through the opposite port, yet\r\n  none were hit. A shell exploded in the hammock-netting and set the\r\n  ship on fire; the alarm calling for fire-quarters was sounded, and\r\n  men detailed for such an emergency put out the fire, while the rest\r\n  stayed at the guns.\r\n\r\n  The _Kearsarge_ concentrated her fire and poured in the eleven-inch\r\n  shells with deadly effect. One penetrated the coal-bunker of the\r\n  _Alabama_, and a dense cloud of coal-dust arose. Others struck near\r\n  the water-line between the main and mizzen masts, exploded within\r\n  board, or passing through burst beyond. Crippled and torn, the\r\n  _Alabama_ moved less quickly and began to settle by the stern, yet\r\n  did not slacken her fire, but returned successive broadsides without\r\n  disastrous result to us.\r\n\r\n  Captain Semmes witnessed the havoc made by the shells, especially by\r\n  those of our after pivot-gun, and offered a reward for its silence.\r\n  Soon his battery was turned upon this particular offending gun\r\n  for the purpose of silencing it. It was in vain, for the work of\r\n  destruction went on. We had completed the seventh rotation on the\r\n  circular track and begun the eighth; the _Alabama_, now settling,\r\n  sought to escape by setting all available sail (fore-trysail and two\r\n  jibs), left the circle, amid a shower of shot and shell, and headed\r\n  for the French waters; but to no purpose. In winding the _Alabama_\r\n  presented the port battery with only two guns bearing, and showed\r\n  gaping sides through which the water washed. The _Kearsarge_ pursued,\r\n  keeping on a line nearer the shore, and with a few well-directed\r\n  shots hastened the sinking condition. Then the _Alabama_ was at our\r\n  mercy. Thus ended the fight after one hour and two minutes.\r\n\r\nOne incident of this battle much talked of at the time, and given as\r\nan excuse for their defeat by the Confederates (though without good\r\nreason), was the fact that the waist of the _Kearsarge_, opposite the\r\nengines, was protected by anchor-chains, hung in close festoons on the\r\noutside of the ship, and kept in place and concealed by a boxing of\r\nthin boards. This, however, was not the first attempt at protecting\r\nships by armor, which had now become necessary to meet successfully\r\nthe better guns and projectiles that year by year were increased in\r\npenetrative power. New powders and explosives were constantly being\r\ninvented also, each more effective than the preceding; and as these\r\nwere not only used in guns but applied to the filling of shells, these\r\nbursting missiles for a time almost displaced solid shot.\r\n\r\nAlong with this the discovery and perfection of the Bessemer and\r\nother processes of making steel, and methods of adapting rifling to\r\ngreat cannon, produced a rapid and varied increase in size and an\r\nimprovement in quality in the guns supplied to ships as well as in\r\nthose used upon shore.\r\n\r\nAgainst these new weapons the old “wooden walls” were of no avail. Oak\r\nand teak, however sound and thick, failed to turn aside the conical\r\nprojectiles as they had the old round shot and shell. The ponderous\r\nmissiles would crash clear through, smashing everything in their path,\r\nand sending showers of death-dealing splinters right and left. The navy\r\nhad to protect itself by a revival of the armor with which knights of\r\nthe middle ages guarded against arrows and javelins and sword-points.\r\nBy and by, when guns and bullets came, the knights thickened their\r\narmor in an attempt to resist these new missiles, until at last it\r\nreached a weight too great to be carried, and the whole cumbrous\r\npanoply had to be laid aside, and knightly tactics altogether changed.\r\nMany persons believe that this history will be repeated in the case\r\nof the sea-warriors of the world, which, within the memory of many a\r\ngrizzled admiral, have changed from buoyant and beautiful ships to grim\r\nand shapeless fortresses afloat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE UNITED STATES FRIGATE “MERRIMAC” BEFORE AND AFTER CONVERSION INTO\r\n  AN IRONCLAD.\r\n\r\nCompare with illustration on page 139.]\r\n\r\nThe Americans, fearless of sea-traditions, were the first to propose\r\narmor for ships, but the French first practically applied it, building\r\nseveral “floating batteries,” covered with iron 4¾ inches thick, in\r\n1855. The English copied them, in somewhat more ship-shape form; and\r\nthen the French began boldly to sheathe some of their frigates with\r\niron plates and call them “ironclads.” By this time iron hulls had\r\nbegun to be used commonly in the British merchant service, but of\r\ncourse the men-of-war’s men, the slowest class of persons on earth\r\nto accept any change, insisted that iron would by no means do for\r\nwar-ships. Nevertheless a few progressive spirits persuaded their\r\nhigh-mightinesses, the Lords of the Admiralty, to try an experiment\r\nin building one, and, in 1860, the first iron war-ship was launched\r\nand named _Warrior_, while all the old salts wagged their heads and\r\npredicted the end of “Britannia rules the waves,” until there wasn’t a\r\nreally _jolly_ tar to be found from Penolar Point to Pentland Firth.\r\nTo a certain extent these hardy old growlers were right, though their\r\nidea of a remedy was wrong. It proved a failure to build old-style\r\nbattle-ships of iron or even of steel, or to coat them all over with\r\narmor, even when greatly thickened. Not only were they slow and\r\nsomewhat unmanageable, but by the time one of them had been built with\r\nthicker walls than its latest rival, somebody had invented artillery\r\nwhose projectiles would penetrate it. Ships that are “ship-shape,”\r\nthat is, possess masts and sails, but are constructed wholly of iron\r\nor steel, and more or less heavily armored, have survived, and will\r\nalways be a part of the world’s navies, no doubt, but their uses will\r\nbe subsidiary to heavy fighting; and with the disappearance of the\r\nwooden sailing line-of-battle ship in the Crimean war and of the iron\r\nwar-steamer a quarter of a century later, all traditions of the “old\r\nnavy” were ended—traditions that went back to the days of Drake.\r\n\r\nBut who could have foreseen that this swift and momentous upsetting\r\nshould come about, not through the efforts of the great sea powers of\r\nEurope,—the giants who had been struggling for the control of the ocean\r\nfor three hundred years,—but from the brain and purse of landsmen in a\r\ncountry of the New World not taken into account as a naval power at all.\r\n\r\nYou need not be told that it was Ericsson’s invention and Henry\r\nGrinnell’s building and Lieutenant Worden’s courageous fighting of the\r\nlittle _Monitor_ in Hampton Roads, on that fair March Sunday in 1862,\r\nthat brought about this change. When her turret—the “cheese-box on a\r\nraft”—successfully withstood the assault of that heavily armed floating\r\nbattery, the _Merrimac_ (or _Virginia_), all the war-ships of the world\r\nfelt themselves beaten, too, and wise seamen saw that they must prepare\r\nto face a new foe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIDE ELEVATION AND DECK-PLAN OF THE “MONITOR.”]\r\n\r\nAt once all maritime governments began to build fighting-vessels which\r\nwere castles of steel afloat, and smaller ships for various services\r\nthat more resembled a Nootka war-canoe in outline than one of the\r\nfrigates that used to do their work. So shapeless were they that a\r\nnew term had to be used, and we began to call them _cruisers_. All\r\nwar-ships, in fact, are now classified by their work, not by their\r\nshape or size or rig.\r\n\r\nFirst, fewest, and heaviest are the harbor-defense vessels—monitors and\r\nmassively walled floating batteries, intended to remain in harbors, or\r\nclose to the coast, as movable forts.\r\n\r\nSecond, battle-ships—the strongest, most thickly armored, heavily armed\r\nstyle of ships that can be made, and still be able to go to sea; but\r\nthese are not expected to leave their home ports for a long time, nor\r\nto go to any great distance unless compelled to do so in actual war.\r\n\r\nThird, cruisers. These take the place of the old-fashioned lesser\r\nfighting-ships, the seventy-fours, frigates, corvettes, and sloops, and\r\nvary greatly in size, model, speed, and power of armament.\r\n\r\nFourth, small, swift, strongly armed but lightly armored, torpedo-boat\r\nchasers, small gunboats for use in rivers and shallow coastal waters,\r\ndespatch-boats, dynamite-cruisers, such as our American _Vesuvius_,\r\ntow-boats, and similar minor craft—the run-abouts of the naval service.\r\n\r\nFifth, torpedo-boats.\r\n\r\nThe material of all these is steel. Wood is no longer permitted even in\r\nthe fittings of their cabins, because wood will splinter and burn.\r\n\r\nThe great hull of a modern battle-ship, as described by Lieutenant S.\r\nA. Staunton, U. S. N., which supports and carries the vast weights of\r\nmachinery, guns, and armor, aggregating perhaps more than ten thousand\r\ntons, is built of plates of rolled steel, varying from 1⅜ inches thick\r\nat the keel to ¾ inch at the water-line. These are closely jointed and\r\nfitted, and bound together with straps, angle-irons, and brackets, so\r\nas to make a strong unyielding structure braced in all directions.\r\nThen, through the central part of the ship, at least, vertical plates\r\nare erected upon the frame and outside plating, which bear a second\r\nor inner bottom, thus forming the “double bottom” as high as the\r\nwater-line, having the space between the inner and outer sheathing\r\nseparated into a multitude of small water-tight cells, so that an\r\ninjury to the outside hull would not cause the vessel to leak unless\r\nthe inner bottom were also punctured.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole length of the vessel, reaching from side to\r\nside and from the keel to the main deck, are many steel bulkheads,\r\nsufficiently strong to resist the pressure of the water, and\r\ncommunicating only by water-tight doors, so that even were an accident,\r\nsuch as a collision or running upon a rock, or an enemy’s shell, to\r\nopen a hole through both bottoms, the ship would still float, because\r\nthe inflowing water would be confined to a single compartment, leaving\r\nthe rest of the ship dry and buoyant. Nothing less than the blow of a\r\nram, smashing through everything and throwing several compartments\r\ninto one, would be likely to sink such a ship, and this is one reason\r\nwhy ramming has again become prominent in naval tactics.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST SEA-FIGHT OF MODERN WAR-SHIPS.\r\n\r\nThe Peruvian turret-ship “Huascar” between the fire of the Chilean\r\nironclads “Almirante Cochrane” and “Blanco Encalada,” October 8, 1879.]\r\n\r\nBut while safety from sinking is thus reasonably assured, this is more\r\na precaution of seaworthiness against the accidents of storms than\r\ntoward injuries receivable in battle. Passenger and freight steamers\r\nnow have the double bottoms and water-tight compartments, and the best\r\nof these have arrangements for mounting light but powerful guns upon\r\ntheir decks, so that they may be utilized by the government in a war\r\nemergency as light cruisers, as armed transports, as swift scouts, or\r\nin other highly important ways; they will then be coated with a light\r\nprotective armor, but will not be expected to engage in a contest with\r\na real fighting-vessel.\r\n\r\nThe idea of armor-plate is, as has been said, scarcely half a\r\ncentury old, and the moment it was put on (amid the jeers of the old\r\nline-of-battle tars, who thought they had done all that the dignity\r\nof the profession permitted when they arranged their rolled-up\r\nhammocks along the bulwarks to catch musket-balls, and spread nettings\r\nto prevent somewhat the flight of splinters) ingenious men began to\r\nimprove their powder and strengthen their guns to overcome the new\r\ndefenses. To meet these improvements armor has been increased and\r\nperfected, until now war-vessels are no longer “ships” in any proper\r\nsense of the word, but floating fortresses of steel, the names of whose\r\ndefensive parts, even, have been borrowed from land fortifications,\r\nsuch as _turret_ and _barbette_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE UNITED STATES BATTLE-SHIP “MASSACHUSETTS.”]\r\n\r\nA limit to this defensive strength is marked in two directions.\r\nFirst, by the size it is possible to make a vessel, and still keep\r\nher seaworthy and manageable; and, second, by the weight of armor\r\nsuch a vessel can carry, in addition to the weight of the framework,\r\nmachinery, guns, and other things necessary. These limits seemed to be\r\nreached some time ago in some of the monstrous battle-ships built in\r\nEurope, and when it was found that even while they were in construction\r\nrifled guns had been invented that would drive their projectiles\r\nthrough the thickest wall of wrought-iron or steel that these or any\r\nother vessels could carry, naval constructors began to despair of\r\nkeeping ahead of the gun-makers, and there was even talk of abandoning\r\narmor altogether, and fighting battles out with bared breasts as we\r\nused to do.\r\n\r\n  The percentage of weight which may be allotted to armor in the design\r\n  of a ship limits the area which can be wholly protected, but often\r\n  permits the partial protection of other areas of less importance to\r\n  her vitality and destructive force. Motive power, steering-gear,\r\n  and magazines stand first upon the list of those features demanding\r\n  complete protection.... The heavy shells from an enemy’s guns may do\r\n  many other forms of injury besides sinking a vessel and disabling her\r\n  crew. They may strike and disable her engines, or pierce her boilers,\r\n  causing disastrous explosions. They may injure her steering-gear,\r\n  destroy the mechanism which controls her turrets and guns, or injure\r\n  the guns themselves and their carriages. In every feature of offense\r\n  which renders her a formidable and dangerous foe—her speed, her\r\n  mobility, the fire of her guns—a man-of-war is dangerously vulnerable\r\n  unless she be protected by armor, unless the enemy’s shot be rejected\r\n  by plates which it cannot penetrate.\r\n\r\nThen came an invention that put a new face upon the matter,—the\r\nsurface-hardening of plates, composed of a mixture of nickel with\r\nsteel,—which, from one of its perfectors, is known as “Harveyizing” it.\r\nOther processes also are known. This gave to the surface of the metal\r\nsuch a flinty hardness that the heaviest and most highly tempered steel\r\nprojectiles would almost invariably break to pieces when they struck\r\nit—the same projectiles that were able to punch a hole clear through a\r\ntarget-plate of ordinary wrought-steel twenty-two inches thick!\r\n\r\nPlates thus surface-hardened are now made in Europe, and as well, if\r\nnot better, in the United States, where we have learned and taught the\r\nrest of the world how to make them by rolling—a much better, as well as\r\ncheaper, process than the former method of hammering them into shape.\r\n\r\nIt was found that with these hard-surfaced plates much less thickness\r\nwas required to contend successfully with the great guns opposed to\r\nthem than had been the case before; and the great saving of weight\r\nenabled a much larger extent of armor to be borne upon a ship than was\r\nformerly possible, so arranged as to protect all her hull and vital\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nThus, in a typical modern battle-ship, say 360 feet long, 72\r\nfeet broad, and drawing 24 feet of water, having an armor of\r\nsurface-hardened nickel-steel, this armor is thus disposed: amidships,\r\nand a quarter of her length behind the point of the prow, is built up a\r\nsemicircular “barbette,” or wall, of the thickest armor, behind which\r\nis a “turret,” moving to the right or left through an arc equal to half\r\nthe horizon, no higher than necessary to cover and work the guns, and\r\nhaving its motor mechanism fully protected by the barbette. This is the\r\nforward turret—a swinging fort, carrying with it, as it turns, two of\r\nthe heaviest guns in the ship.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE UNITED STATES BATTLE-SHIP “INDIANA.”]\r\n\r\nHalf-way from the center to the stern stands the after turret and its\r\nbarbette, similarly built of the strongest armor,—ten to twelve inches\r\nthick,—and sweeping with its guns half the horizon.\r\n\r\nFrom a point just in front of the forward barbette two walls of the\r\nheaviest possible armor, reaching vertically from four and a half feet\r\nbelow the water-line (loaded) to three feet above it, extend diagonally\r\nbackward to the sides of the ship, then continue along its side in a\r\n“belt” to points opposite the after barbette, where they bend inward\r\nas before and meet just aft of the after barbette; but hereafter the\r\nincreased efficiency of armor, by further reducing its weight, will\r\nprobably enable the armor-belts to be carried to the extreme ends of\r\nthe ship, which otherwise can be so seriously damaged by an enemy as to\r\ninterfere with the speed and control of a ship in action, even if it\r\ndoes not disable her.\r\n\r\nBut while these upright walls will resist a direct shot, it is equally\r\nnecessary to guard against a plunging fire, and therefore the space\r\nbetween the turrets, at least, must be roofed over with a steel deck,\r\ntwo or three inches thick, to deflect shot that come just over the top\r\nof the armor-belt.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, on each side of the vessel are erected one or\r\ntwo smaller turrets, carrying somewhat smaller guns than those of\r\nthe forward and after turrets, and also protected by heavy barbettes\r\nwhich reach down to the armor-belt and thoroughly protect the turning\r\nmechanism, passage of ammunition, etc. These various upper parts are\r\nconnected by defenses which may not resist the largest shells, but are\r\nsafe against smaller shot.\r\n\r\nNow, what is the armament of this fortress which thus protects all the\r\nmotive power and interior machinery of the ship, by which she can be\r\nmade so terrible an engine of combative force? Well, it is as different\r\nfrom the bronze “long-toms” and carronades of the old three-deckers,\r\nor even from ten-inch smooth-bore “Dahlgrens” of the days of our Civil\r\nWar, as is the ship itself from old-time models. In place of broadside\r\nbatteries of forty or fifty cannon hidden in clouds of smoke, there are\r\nnow six or eight big rifles, from whose muzzles wreaths of thin gas\r\nonly drift to leeward; and, more striking still, in contrast, a ship\r\nis no longer comparatively helpless when headed or turned sternward\r\nto an enemy,—when the “raking,” formerly so justly dreaded, would be\r\nreceived,—but is rather more able to do damage in that position than by\r\na “broadside.”\r\n\r\nThe guns themselves are marvels of structure and power. All of those\r\nused in the United States navy are made by the government in the\r\ngun-shops at the Washington navy-yard, and are “built up.” The methods\r\nand tools required for this are the invention of Americans, as well as\r\nthe complicated arrangements for closing the breech, and the carriages\r\nand mechanism for overcoming the tremendous recoil and handling the\r\nponderous ammunition; the latter, often weighing hundreds of pounds,\r\nis handed up to the gunners from the magazines below by hoists worked\r\nby electricity.\r\n\r\nThe history of the development of heavy ordnance, especially that\r\napplied to naval uses, is one of the most interesting chapters in\r\nmechanics; and a surprising number of ways of making a ship’s cannon\r\nhave been tried and rejected. Out of this two things seem now to be\r\nsettled: namely, that a gun composed of steel in separate parts welded\r\ntogether is best, and that the best missile to shoot from it is a\r\nconical shell, very hard and heavy, yet containing an explosive small\r\nin quantity but exceedingly powerful.\r\n\r\nSuch guns are built up of a tube or “core” of steel of the required\r\nsize, upon which is shrunk a jacket, covering the rear, or breech half\r\nof the core, outside of which are shrunk on several broad hoops. The\r\ncutting out of the bore to exactly the proper caliber and the plowing\r\nof the spiral riflings put the gun in readiness for its breech-closing\r\nand other attachments. This process requires several months, involves\r\nlarge capital and powerful machinery, and good results imply the very\r\nhighest workmanship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE UNITED STATES CRUISER “BROOKLYN” (STERN VIEW).]\r\n\r\nSuch are the guns of modern men-of-war; and a first-class battle-ship\r\ncarries four twelve- or thirteen-inch rifles (that is, having a bore\r\ntwelve or thirteen inches in diameter), several eight- or ten-inch\r\nrifles, and many smaller guns arranged to be fired with extraordinary\r\nspeed, and hence called “rapid-fire” guns; while her upper works\r\nand “military tops” fairly bristle with fierce little six-, four-,\r\nand one-pounders,—revolving magazine rifles, capable of discharging\r\nrifle-balls as fast as a man can turn the crank.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON BOARD A BATTLE-SHIP GOING INTO ACTION. WORKING THE\r\nRAPID-FIRE GUNS.]\r\n\r\nTo give some idea of the size and power of one of the 13-inch guns,\r\nwhose long muzzles, in pairs, project so far out of the turrets that\r\nhide their mountings and firing-crew, let me tell you that it is 40\r\nfeet long, more than 4 feet in diameter, and weighs 60½ tons. “It\r\nrequires 550 pounds of powder to load it, and the projectile weighs\r\nhalf a ton. The muzzle-velocity of the projectile is 2100 feet per\r\nsecond, with the stated charge, and its energy is sufficient to send it\r\nthrough 26 inches of steel at a distance of 600 yards. At an elevation\r\nof 40 degrees the range of the gun will be not far from 15 miles.”\r\n\r\nIn such a ship, deep down within the fortress is the massive and\r\ncomplicated machinery, steam and electric, upon which the life and\r\nactivity of the whole structure depend. The power is generated in four\r\nenormous boilers, seventeen feet in diameter and twenty in length,\r\ntheir steel shells one and a half inches thick, built to carry a\r\nworking-pressure of 160 pounds to the square inch. Each pair of these\r\nboilers, placed fore and aft and side by side, is installed in a\r\nseparate compartment, with fire-rooms at the ends. Every boiler has\r\nfour furnaces in each end, which give eight to each fire-room, or a\r\ntotal of thirty-two. The two boiler compartments are separated by a\r\nwater-tight bulkhead, and by a deep, broad coal-bunker. At the sides of\r\nthe ship are also coal-bunkers, which supplement the heavy armor-belt\r\nby the protection of a mass of coal twelve feet in thickness—in itself\r\na not inconsiderable earthwork, which might arrest the fragments of a\r\nbursting shell that had succeeded in piercing the armor. No casualty of\r\nnaval combat can be worse than the penetration of high-pressure boilers\r\nby heavy shells. Their complete protection is an imperative condition,\r\nquite as important as the protection of the magazines.\r\n\r\nSuch is a modern battle-ship—a “wonderful and complex instrument of\r\nwarfare,” as Lieutenant Staunton has expressed it.\r\n\r\n  She is filled [he tells us] with powerful agencies, all obedient to\r\n  the control of man—the creatures of his brain and the servants of his\r\n  will. Steam in its simple application drives her main engines and\r\n  many auxiliaries. Steam transformed into hydraulic power moves her\r\n  steering-gear and turns her turrets. Steam converted into electrical\r\n  energy produces her incandescent and search-lights, works small\r\n  motors in remote places, and fires her guns when desired. Every\r\n  application of energy, every device of mechanism, finds its office\r\n  somewhere in that vast hull, and the source of all the varied forms\r\n  of power lies in the great boilers, far down below danger of shot\r\n  and shell, under which grimy stokers are always shoveling coal.\r\n  Decades of thought and study, experiment and failure, trial again\r\n  with partial success, and repeated trials with complete success, have\r\n  assigned to each agency its appropriate function, and perfected the\r\n  mechanism through which its work is performed.\r\n\r\nThese modern developments have added one entirely novel and tremendous\r\nadjunct to the fleet, in the torpedo-boat and its terrible weapon.\r\nThese take the place to some extent of the fire-ship of a century ago,\r\nwhich was designed to injure the enemy not by silencing his guns or\r\novercoming his gunners, but by insidiously destroying his ship itself.\r\n\r\nThe torpedo is, in its simplest form, simply some arrangement of a\r\npowerful explosive to be set off beneath or against the bottom of a\r\nship, and shatter or sink it. The idea is as old as gunpowder, but it\r\nis only in recent times that it has been made effective,—how effective\r\nwe do not yet know.\r\n\r\nTorpedoes are used in two ways: one is by fixing the torpedo beneath\r\nthe water, either to be exploded by means of a percussion-cap when the\r\nship runs against it, or from the shore by means of electricity. Such\r\narrangements as this, called submarine mines, are regarded as a most\r\nimportant means of defending harbors against hostile attack. During\r\nour Civil War they were extensively used by the Confederates, and were\r\nsometimes successful, as when one destroyed the monitor _Tecumseh_ in\r\nMobile harbor, during Farragut’s famous attack there in 1864.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MONITOR “TECUMSEH” SUNK BY A TORPEDO AT MOBILE,\r\n1864.]\r\n\r\nThe former class, for which the word _torpedoes_ is now reserved,\r\nincludes explosive agents which are to be placed or sent against a\r\nship’s bottom at sea and exploded there. Various devices of that kind,\r\nalso, have been used for a long time in naval warfare. The Confederates\r\ntried hard to destroy several Northern vessels in the blockading\r\nsquadron by devising very small, half-submerged boats, towing torpedoes\r\nastern, or else projecting on a long spar from their bows; and now and\r\nthen they succeeded, as when one of the latter kind was made to sink\r\nthe _Housatonic_ off Charleston.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SEARCH-LIGHT REVEALING THE TORPEDO-BOAT.]\r\n\r\nThen there have been invented, during the past fifty years, several\r\ncigar-shaped machines, which, by means of a chemical or compressed-air\r\nengine or clockwork, or some other application of power that might\r\nkeep motive machinery within them going long enough, could be launched\r\nfrom shore or from another vessel and sent under water against a\r\nhostile ship. At first these were made to glide along just beneath the\r\nsurface, carrying little flags that could be seen, and trailing two\r\nelectric wires, enabling a person, by means of electric currents,\r\nto direct their flight; but latterly ingenuity has devised such an\r\narrangement of rudders and self-acting balances within the torpedo’s\r\nmechanism that it will continue perfectly straight upon the course\r\nit is aimed for, swerving neither right nor left, up nor down, and\r\nwill explode the instant it touches an object hard enough to jar the\r\ndelicate cap of fulminate in its snout. This latter kind, called the\r\nautomobile (self-moving) torpedo, is now almost exclusively used, and\r\nsome modification of the Whitehead is most popular. It is cigar-shaped,\r\nand about twelve feet in length; the forward third is filled with\r\ngun-cotton—in quantity sufficiently powerful, if accurately applied, to\r\nruin almost instantly the greatest battle-ship afloat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SELF-MOVING TORPEDO ON ITS WAY TO ATTACK A MAN-OF-WAR.]\r\n\r\nAll large war-ships are now fitted with tubes, opening near the\r\nwater-line in various parts of the hull, which form gun-like exits for\r\nthese terrible weapons, which are set in motion by a puff of gunpowder;\r\nbut in addition to this every maritime government now has a number\r\n(Great Britain has more than 250) of small, swift steamers designed\r\nwholly for this purpose and called torpedo-boats. Most of them are a\r\nhundred feet or so in length, and intended to accompany the fleet\r\nwherever it goes and in all weathers; but some are so small that they\r\nmay be carried on the deck of a big cruiser.\r\n\r\nAll are made long, low, and narrow, and the speed of many of them\r\nexceeds thirty miles an hour. There is almost nothing to catch the wind\r\nor show above deck except a pair of short, flattened smoke-stacks, one\r\nbehind the other; and the steersman stands, with only his head and\r\nshoulders visible, in a little box with windows that serves the purpose\r\nof a wheel-house. A mere wire railing saves the crew from sliding off\r\nthe deck, and in action everybody stays below. No weight is carried\r\nthat can be avoided, and the engines, taking steam from two boilers,\r\nare as powerful as can be packed into the space at command. Usually\r\nonly coal enough for a few hours’ steaming is carried, and every bushel\r\nof it is carefully selected as to quality, and is so treated and\r\nintelligently fed to the furnaces as to make the hottest possible fire,\r\nalthough never a spark must escape from the smoke-stack to betray the\r\nvessel in the darkness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TORPEDO-BOAT AT FULL SPEED.]\r\n\r\nNext to speed the most important quality is ability to turn quickly,\r\nupon which might often depend the safety of the audacious little craft.\r\n\r\nTorpedo-boats, however, are designed for a wider service than simply\r\nto carry and discharge the frightful weapon from which they take their\r\nname. They are to the navy what scouts and skirmishers are to a land\r\narmy. They form the cavalry of the sea, of which the cruisers are the\r\ninfantry, and the battle-ships and monitors the artillery arm. They\r\nmust spy out the position of the enemy’s fleet, hover about his flanks\r\nor haunt his anchorage to ascertain what he is about and what he means\r\nto do next. They must act as the pickets of their own fleet, patrolling\r\nthe neighborhood, or waiting and watching, concealed among islands or\r\nin inlets and river-mouths, ready to hasten away to the admiral with\r\nwarning of any movement of the adversary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE FORM OF SUBMARINE TORPEDO-BOAT.]\r\n\r\nIt is not their business to fight (except rarely, in the one particular\r\nway), but rather to pry and sneak and run, for the benefit of the fleet\r\nthey serve.\r\n\r\nBut to insure all these fine results, both officers and men must be\r\ntaught the art. Constant instruction and drilling are necessary, and\r\nin each navy a regular school of torpedo-practice is maintained, where\r\nthe subject is studied in every way. In the United States such a school\r\nis kept at the Newport (R. I.) Torpedo Station, where the torpedoes\r\nthemselves are fitted for use and supplied to the ships (the loaded\r\nwar-heads are kept separately in the ship’s magazine), and where one or\r\nmore torpedo-boats are reserved for drilling purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  COPYRIGHT, 1897, BY C. E. BOLLES, BROOKLYN, N. Y.\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES BATTLE-SHIP “MAINE.”\r\n\r\nBlown up in the harbor of Havana, February 15, 1898.]\r\n\r\nBut a worse and more insidious foe than even these sneaking, hiding,\r\nsurface torpedo-boats threatens us in the submarine torpedo-boat, which\r\ninventors have been experimenting with since naval warfare first began.\r\nIt is said that twenty-five hundred years ago divers were lowered\r\ninto the water in a simply constructed air-box, to perforate the\r\nwooden bottom of an adversary’s war-galley and sink it. Again, in our\r\nRevolutionary War, a tiny walnut-shaped boat was made by an American,\r\nwhich was actually tried. It would hold one man, and air enough for him\r\nto breathe for half an hour. He would close the hatch, let in enough\r\nwater to sink him a little way, and then scull himself along by means\r\nof a screw-bladed stern-oar until he got underneath the keel of an\r\nanchored vessel, to which, by ingenious means, he would attach a can of\r\ngunpowder to be fired by clockwork, giving him time to get away. It was\r\nactually tried and nearly succeeded. Robert Fulton, who made the first\r\nsuccess of the steamboat, tried for years to contrive a submarine boat\r\nthat would work, and succeeded so far as to scare British blockaders in\r\n1812 very badly indeed; and the Confederates repeated the scare when\r\nthe North was blockading their ports in the Civil War.\r\n\r\nThe great advantage of a submarine boat is, of course, its\r\ninvisibility, and its safety from shot even if discovered; but the\r\ndifficulties of progress and control as to depth and direction under\r\nwater, and at the same time effective appliance of the explosive and\r\nsafe retreat, are so many that they have as yet been only partly\r\novercome. If the thing is ever accomplished, naval warfare will be\r\ndemoralized until some adequate means be found to combat this unseen,\r\ndestroying agency.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Vesuvius_ in action.]\r\n\r\nThe principal agent in submarine attacks would probably be some form\r\nof dynamite, which, inhuman as its use seems, is slowly but surely\r\ntaking its place among the weapons of war. The United States has one\r\nvessel primarily designed to employ dynamite by hurling it in the form\r\nof shells. This volcanic craft is suitably named _Vesuvius_, and is\r\na small, swift vessel having long tubes slanting upward through her\r\nforward deck, as shown in the illustration.\r\n\r\nThese tubes are the muzzles of great air-guns, through which she sends\r\ndarts loaded with dynamite to fall upon a hostile ship or fort. It\r\nwould not be safe, to say the least, to fire such bombs with gunpowder;\r\nand therefore pumps and engines in her interior compress air until it\r\nhas acquired an expansive force sufficient for the purpose. When one\r\nof the darts has been laid in the breech of the tube, down beneath the\r\ndeck, and suitably closed in, a valve is opened, the compressed air\r\nacts like burning powder, and away goes the dart, in a graceful curve\r\nto its target. In this case, of course, it is the vessel rather than\r\nthe immovable gun that is aimed, and good marksmanship depends upon\r\naccurate calculation of distance; but remarkable shooting has been\r\ndone. This system has never yet been tried in actual warfare, and may\r\nprove valuable chiefly in clearing harbors of mines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE MERCHANTS OF THE SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of shipping in an earlier chapter will also answer as a\r\nhistory of early international commerce. It began with the Egyptians\r\nand Phenicians, and was confined to their parts of the Mediterranean\r\nuntil after the middle ages, when it moved steadily to the western\r\nborders of Europe.\r\n\r\nHow great, rich, and influential were Tyre and its people we have\r\nalready seen. A thousand years before the Christian era they controlled\r\nthe commerce of the ancient world by reason of their wisdom as traders\r\nand their skill and energy as navigators and seamen. Turn to the\r\ntwenty-seventh chapter of Ezekiel, and see how the Phenician metropolis\r\nwas regarded, even in the time of that prophet, six hundred years\r\nbefore Christ. These Syrians had gradually extended their commerce\r\nuntil it took in the whole known world; and by their caravans to\r\nand from the interior of Arabia, Persia, India, and the Soudan, by\r\ntheir trains (perhaps of pack-horses) across Europe, by their marine\r\nexpeditions to the Nile,—which they forced open to trade, for ancient\r\nEgypt was much like China in its exclusiveness,—and by their ships to\r\nall the Mediterranean ports, and up and down the Atlantic coast, they\r\ngathered and exchanged in the bazaars of Tyre and Sidon the products,\r\nmanufactures, and luxuries of every country that had anything to sell.\r\nTo the Phenicians, indeed, was ascribed, by the Latin and Greek writers\r\nof a few centuries later, the invention of navigation; and even when\r\nPhenicia had become of little account as a nation, its conquerors noted\r\nwith admiration the skill of the men of that coast in seamanship.\r\n“They steered by the pole-star, which the Greeks therefore called the\r\nPhenician star; and all their vessels, from the common round _gaulos_\r\nto the great Tarshish ships,—the East-Indiamen, so to speak, of the\r\nancient world,—had a speed which the Greeks never rivaled.”\r\n\r\nLater, in the days of the Roman supremacy, the trading-ships were as\r\nimportant to the country as its soldiers, for nearly every free man was\r\nin the army, and the slaves made poor farmers. A large part of the\r\ngrain, as well as cattle, to supply the wants of the people, had to be\r\nbrought from Egypt, which was pretty sure to have “corn,” as the Bible\r\ncalls it, when the rest of the world was suffering from short crops.\r\nEgypt supplied grain to Rome during the second Punic war, thus enabling\r\nher to resist the invasion of Carthage, and it is possible that Rome’s\r\nlater political alliance with Egypt was largely due to her interest in\r\nEgyptian crops. Large fleets of grain-ships, convoyed by armed vessels,\r\nwere continually passing between the African coast and the Tiber, and\r\nso many were the risks they ran of wreck or capture, that the arrival\r\nof a flotilla with its precious freight of food was always a cause of\r\nrejoicing, at any rate, among the poor.\r\n\r\nThese merchant ships of classical times were broader and heavier\r\nthan the war-galleys, and although they carried a few oars to help\r\nthemselves in a difficulty, they ordinarily moved by means of sails,\r\nprobably lugs. One of the grain-ships plying between Egypt and Italy\r\nabout 150 A. D., according to Lucian, was one hundred and eighty feet\r\nlong, slightly more than one fourth as broad, and forty-three and a\r\nhalf feet deep inside,— more like a barge than a “ship.” The largest\r\nused in this trade would carry about two hundred and fifty tons. The\r\ntransports that accompanied one of Justinian’s fleets, A. D. 533, are\r\nstated to have carried one hundred and sixty to two hundred tons of\r\nsupplies each.\r\n\r\nThese Roman vessels were made of pine, and were coated with a\r\ncomposition of tar and wax, then painted, often with elaborate\r\ndecorations in bright colors, with pigments mixed with melted wax. Now\r\nand then one was built of truly vast proportions, as that one which\r\nbrought from Egypt to Rome the first of the stolen obelisks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CAPTAIN IN THE MERCHANT MARINE.]\r\n\r\nWith that grand awakening of interest in education, industry, and\r\ndiscovery which took place in the fourteenth century, the city of\r\nVenice gained the lead in power, and her merchants became the most\r\nenterprising and wealthy. It was the expansion of commerce that urged\r\nthe explorations that marked the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries,\r\nfor by this time Venice had her banks—the first in the world to\r\napproach the character of modern banks—and her exchange on the famous\r\nRialto bridge; Genoa was in close rivalry; Spain was gathering immense\r\nquantities of gold in South America; and England was coming to the\r\nfront as a maritime power. The trade with Cathay—as India, China, and\r\nthe Oriental islands were called collectively—was chiefly by caravans\r\nacross the Persian deserts, and Spain, England, and Holland had\r\nsmall shares in it, since the only water-route known was through the\r\nMediterranean and Red seas, where, between the perils of the ocean,\r\nthe extortionate charges and stealings of the Arabs (who carried the\r\ncargoes from vessel to vessel across the Isthmus of Suez), and the risk\r\nof capture by Algerian pirates, there was little chance left for profit\r\nto either merchants or ship-owners.\r\n\r\nTo western Europe, then, Vasco de Gama’s discovery of the route around\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope was a long advantage, and England and Holland\r\nat least were quick to seize it. The great “East India Companies” of\r\nthe Dutch and English were formed by a group of powerful merchants\r\nin London and in Amsterdam, who were given vast privileges by their\r\ngovernments in respect to trading in the East. The Dutch company was\r\nnot founded until 1602, two years after the English company, but it\r\nsoon became the more prominent of the two, and was one of the principal\r\nmeans by which the Netherlands secured the preponderance of the\r\ncarrying trade of the world, bringing to her ports, by the middle of\r\nthe seventeenth century, almost all the commerce previously enjoyed by\r\nCadiz, Lisbon, and Antwerp, and making very serious inroads upon that\r\nof London and Bristol. The Dutch East India ships, copied from the\r\nGenoese carracks, were the biggest merchant vessels then afloat, well\r\nable to cope with many of the war-ships; and two hundred of them were\r\nat this time engaged in the Asiatic trade alone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CLIPPER ESCAPING FROM THE “ALABAMA.”]\r\n\r\nIt was in aid of the English rival company not only, but as an attempt\r\nto save and revive the commercial position of England generally, that\r\nCromwell’s “navigation laws” were enacted, prohibiting the carriage\r\nof goods to or from British shores except in ships owned and manned\r\nby Englishmen,— laws that were aimed directly at the Dutch, and led\r\nto the long wars of the latter half of the seventeenth century. These\r\nwere called wars for the supremacy of the sea, but actually they were a\r\nprolonged struggle for the biggest share of the world’s trade, which is\r\nthe only real value of the “supremacy of the sea.” It is a saying that\r\n“trade follows the flag,” and so it does; but at the beginning the flag\r\ngoes were the trade is to be had.\r\n\r\nThese companies were so mixed up in the politics of their respective\r\ngovernments that it would be a long task, although entertaining, to\r\ntrace their growth, which is really that of western civilization in the\r\nEast. They equipped fleets of merchant and war vessels, established\r\nforts, carried on small wars along the Oriental coasts, and were really\r\nlittle kingdoms within kingdoms, because of their wide monopoly,\r\nenormous wealth, and the national importance of all their enterprises.\r\nThe final result was that, as Great Britain finally overcame the Dutch\r\nand French at home, so her East India Company ousted them from India;\r\nbut it was not until 1858 that old “John Company,” which had come to\r\nbe regarded by the natives of India as the government itself, was\r\ndissolved, and resigned its territories to the crown and a system of\r\ntrade open to all the world.\r\n\r\nThose were slow and costly times compared with the present, though\r\nseeming to us full of a romance impossible now. A voyage around the\r\nworld occupied three years, and to go from London to Calcutta and\r\nback took from New Year’s to Christmas under the most favorable\r\ncircumstances. Another important change, too, has gradually come about.\r\nFormerly, the vessels were owned almost entirely by the merchants\r\nthemselves, or by a company of them; they paid all a ship’s expenses,\r\nand put into her a cargo of their own wares. They would send to China,\r\nfor instance, cotton goods, household furniture, hatchets, tools,\r\ncutlery and other hardware, farming implements, and fancy goods of all\r\nsorts. In return the vessels would bring silks, tea, and porcelain,\r\nwhich would go into the owners’ warehouses and be sold in their own\r\nshops. Shipper, importer, and merchant were all one.\r\n\r\nNow this is changed. The importers and merchants of London, Hamburg,\r\nand New York are not often those who own vessels and bring their own\r\ngoods. Instead of this they have agents, who live permanently in each\r\nof the foreign ports, where they buy the merchandise they want and hire\r\na vessel, or the needed space in a vessel, belonging to somebody else\r\nto bring them home. By the old way, the nation which had anything to\r\nsell carried it to the nation that would buy it, and brought back the\r\nbest thing it could get in exchange; now the merchants go to various\r\nparts of the world, buy their cargoes, and order them sent home, in\r\nsubstantially the same way as you go a-shopping in town.\r\n\r\nThis has brought out a new department of sea-labor, unknown, as a\r\nclass, a century ago—the business of carrying goods which the owners of\r\nthe vessels have no property in. In London, New York, Hamburg, and all\r\nother seaboard cities of this and other countries, the great majority\r\nof the shipping is owned, not by the merchants of the city, but by\r\n“transportation companies,” who agree to carry cargoes at a certain\r\nrate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SALOON OF A SAILING PACKET-SHIP, ABOUT 1840.]\r\n\r\nMerchant vessels may be divided into three classes, of which the first\r\nincludes steamships and sailing-vessels planned primarily for freight\r\ntransportation, which run back and forth between certain ports, and\r\nso constitute “lines” for freight. Such lines exist along even the\r\nremotest coasts, so that goods may be shipped directly, or by a single\r\ntransfer, from any given seaport to almost any other in the world.\r\nSome of these lines, sailing between certain ports, are devoted to\r\nparticular uses, such as those of oil-steamers and cattle-steamers. The\r\noil-steamers run between America and Europe with American petroleum,\r\nand in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean with oil from Russia; the\r\nentire holds are divided into vast iron tanks for this liquid, which is\r\npoured into and pumped out of them as into and out of a great barrel.\r\nThe cattle-steamers are specially arranged for the transportation\r\nof live stock, but one line, running between America and England,\r\nalso carries passengers at a cheap rate. The second class of vessels\r\nconsists of those which make the transportation of passengers their\r\nfirst object, loading their holds with first-class freight, for which\r\nhigh rates are paid in consideration of its swift delivery. The\r\nthird class includes what are known as “tramp” steamers, which run\r\nirregularly, as the old sailing-vessels used to do, picking up cargoes\r\nwherever they find them and carrying them to any port. They are often\r\nof great size and power, but being under less close supervision are\r\noften less careful as to the safety of crews and cargoes, and are\r\nsometimes unseaworthy. They are always ready to answer any sudden\r\ndemand for ships, their owners keeping watch of the chances and\r\ntelegraphing to their captains where to go for their next cargoes.\r\nWithout the submarine telegraph these tramp steamers could scarcely\r\ncompete with the regular lines; but, besides the great transoceanic\r\ncables, all the sea-coasts are now festooned with electric cables,\r\nwhich have frequent stations and connect the important ports of America\r\nand Europe with those of Africa, Persia, India, the Spice Islands,\r\nAustralia, and New Zealand, and there is now a plan to run a cable\r\nacross the Pacific between America and New Zealand, by way of the\r\nSandwich Islands, Samoa, and Fiji.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CORNER IN THE SALOON OF A MODERN STEAMSHIP.]\r\n\r\nThe passenger-ship is a distinctly modern feature of marine carriage.\r\nIn former days the few persons who were obliged to cross the seas on\r\nbusiness errands, and the fewer who went abroad for health or pleasure\r\nor the love of travel, had to accept such rough accommodations as the\r\nordinary merchant ships afforded. But as soon as the East and West\r\nIndies were added to the map of the world, and colonies of Europeans\r\nbegan to settle on distant coasts and islands, the amount of travel\r\njustified owners of vessels in enlarging cabins and providing comforts\r\nlikely to induce patronage of their lines. Even two hundred and\r\ntwenty-five years ago the voyage between India and England around\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, though it became somewhat tedious, because it\r\nlasted six or seven months, was by no means a miserable experience in a\r\nwell-found ship. Thus Dr. John Fryer has recorded of such a sea-journey\r\nin 1682 that “it passed away merrily with good wine and no bad musick;\r\nbut the life of all good company, and an honest commander, who fed us\r\nwith fresh provisions of turkies, geese, ducks, hens, sucking-pigs,\r\nsheep, goats, etc.”\r\n\r\nA century later, when England had come firmly into possession of\r\nIndia, and thousands of her officers, troops, and traders, with their\r\nfamilies, were colonizing her ports, there were demanded the largest\r\nand finest ships that could be built, combining accommodations for\r\nmany passengers with great cargo capacity. Such were the great East\r\nIndiamen; and in those leisurely days a trip half-way round the world\r\non one of these roomy old vessels was a continuous pleasure to almost\r\nevery one that undertook it.\r\n\r\n  The ship was a bit of Old England afloat, where the passenger rented\r\n  for so many months a well-lighted, roomy, unfurnished apartment,\r\n  which, according to his taste and means, he fitted up for the voyage\r\n  with numberless comforts and sea stores that none but a yachtsman\r\n  would think of cumbering himself with at sea to-day; and, reading\r\n  narratives of the old long sea-voyages, one is constantly coming\r\n  across expressions of regret by passengers when they “took leave of\r\n  the good ship that for so many months had been their floating home.”\r\n  These fine old passenger sailing-ships were, like a man-of-war,\r\n  entirely dismantled at the end of each homeward voyage, and underwent\r\n  a complete overhaul and refit before starting out again on an outward\r\n  one. Passengers usually sold their state-room furniture by auction on\r\n  board the ship on her arrival in port.\r\n\r\nSuch a ship, the Atlantic packets, and even men-of-war bound on a long\r\nblockading cruise, did not hesitate to stow aboard all the live stock\r\nthat room could be found for, sometimes by comical devices. In that\r\nbook of charming reminiscences of ways and means afloat before the days\r\nof quick steam transit, “Old Sea Wings,” Mr. Leslie has a chapter which\r\nhe calls “The Old Ship-Farm,” where one may learn curious particulars\r\nof this matter.\r\n\r\n  The man in charge of this part of the stores was the ship’s butcher,\r\n  and he had as “mate,” or assistant, a youth of all work known to all\r\n  sailors as “Jemmy Ducks.” Their barn, or storehouse, was especially\r\n  the great long-boat, which often looked more like a model of Noah’s\r\n  ark than a craft serviceable in case of shipwreck.\r\n\r\n  Always securely stowed amidships, well lashed down and housed\r\n  over, the boat, as she lay upon the ship’s deck, was full of live\r\n  provender, being divided, as to her lower hold, into pens for sheep\r\n  and pigs, while upon the first floor, or main deck, quacked ducks\r\n  and geese, and above them (literally in the cock-loft) were coops\r\n  for another kind of poultry. This great central depôt was closely\r\n  surrounded by other small farm-buildings, the most important being\r\n  the cow-house, where, after a short run ashore on the marshes at the\r\n  end of each voyage, a well-seasoned animal of the snug Alderney breed\r\n  chewed the cud in sweet content. In fact, when, in the old days, a\r\n  passenger-ship began her voyage, the hull of her clumsy long-boat was\r\n  nearly hidden by the number of temporary pens and sheds required to\r\n  house the live stock for the supply of her cabin table; and with its\r\n  many farm-yard and homelike sounds a ship was, even then, more like a\r\n  small bit of the world afloat than it is now.\r\n\r\nThere was always regular traffic between America and Europe, especially\r\nwith Great Britain, and the rapid growth of emigration to the United\r\nStates and Canada made it profitable, early in this century, to put\r\non fast-sailing packet-ships, making voyages, at intervals of a\r\nmonth, between London and New York. By 1840 a man might find a large,\r\nwell-ordered ship departing every week or so for the transatlantic\r\npassage, which usually required less than a month going east, but might\r\nbe two weeks longer coming west. Their cabins were as comfortable and\r\nperhaps more homelike than any seen now, and quite as pretty, with\r\ntheir white and gold paint, cut-glass door and locker knobs, damask\r\nhangings, dimity bed-curtains, and other old-fashioned niceties; and\r\nthe fare was abundant and varied, as it ought to be in a neat ship with\r\na small dairy aboard, and perhaps a green-salad garden planted in the\r\njolly-boat. None of these packets were more popular than those of the\r\nwell-remembered Black Ball Line.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FAIR WEATHER ON THE DECK OF A CLIPPER-SHIP CARRYING\r\nGOLD-SEEKERS TO CALIFORNIA IN 1849.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe steerage passengers were not so well off then, though they seemed\r\nto stand the voyage quite as well as nowadays. The fare was twenty-five\r\ndollars, and the passenger found himself “in everything but fire and\r\nwater.” “Steerage passengers then had to cook their own victuals,\r\nweather permitting, at an open galley-fire on the waist-deck; ... but\r\nin anything like rough weather, all steerage passengers had either\r\nto run the chance of getting constantly wet with salt water or keep\r\nbelow.” The ’tween-decks space allotted to them was almost completely\r\nfilled by rows of bunks, built in each port by the ship’s carpenter,\r\nin three tiers, one above the other, though the ceiling was scarcely\r\nseven feet from the floor; and when in a stormy time the hatches were\r\nclosed the only way the crowd could find room was by most of it stowing\r\nitself away in the bunks, while a few tried to sit or lie on the\r\nluggage piled in the narrow aisles. The only light was that of a few\r\ncandle or whale-oil lanterns, and in a very bad storm everybody came\r\nnear smothering, for then it was impossible to ventilate the steerage\r\nproperly without flooding it. Considering that all the provisions for\r\nthe steerage people were kept in this crowded, damp, and fearfully\r\nclose room, it is marvelous that a pestilence did not break out during\r\nevery voyage, but, in fact, sickness was rare.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of steam into oceanic navigation was experimented with\r\nas soon as river steamboats were successfully built. The first vessel\r\nto go across the ocean by the aid of a steam-engine is said to have\r\nbeen the _Savannah_. This vessel, built in Savannah, Ga., and having a\r\nsteam-engine and paddle-wheels, certainly crossed to Liverpool in 1819;\r\nbut it is asserted that she sailed all the way, using her steam very\r\nlittle, if at all, although making the trip in twenty-two days. In 1825\r\nthe English steamer _Enterprise_ went from London to Calcutta; but it\r\nwas not until some years later that ocean navigation by steam became\r\nsuccessful in the beginning of operations by the Cunard Company in 1833.\r\n\r\nThese first steamers were side-wheelers, and their huge boilers and\r\nsimple engines consumed so much fuel that the space taken up by the\r\ncoal, added to that devoted to passengers, left little room for cargo.\r\nMoreover, their speed was less, often, than that of the “clippers,” so\r\nthat for some time the sailing-packets maintained their competition.\r\nThe adoption of the screw propeller, in place of the costly and\r\ncumbersome side-paddles, and the perfection of the compound marine\r\nengine, which effected a great saving in fuel, soon established the\r\nsuperiority of steam navigation for passenger service, fast freights,\r\nand service in war, yet even these improvements were not fairly brought\r\nabout until the first half of the present century had gone; and sails\r\nare not yet abandoned, not only because they steady a vessel in a gale,\r\nand may help her decidedly when the wind is fair, but may save her\r\naltogether in case of the disabling of her machinery.\r\n\r\n  Great modifications and improvements on old models have grown out of\r\n  the employment of steam and the screw, and human invention has been\r\n  taxed to the uttermost to combine economy of space and expense with\r\n  the various needs of different climes, or special cargoes, or the\r\n  demands of a traveling public that is growing more fastidious every\r\n  day. The most obvious changes in naval construction have been in the\r\n  greatly elongated hull, the enormous dimensions aimed at, and the all\r\n  but universal employment of iron. When the first steamship crossed\r\n  the ocean the proportions of ships averaged three to five beams in\r\n  length.... But it was discovered that with a given power and depth\r\n  and beam the length could be increased without materially affecting\r\n  the speed, thus adding to the carrying capacity of steam. Great\r\n  length to beam, however, does not necessarily imply great speed; the\r\n  speed of beamy vessels has too often been demonstrated. Fineness of\r\n  lines is equally essential, together with the proper distribution\r\n  of weights, and the like. The great average speed exhibited by the\r\n  modern steamship is due in large part to the momentum of such a vast\r\n  weight, which, once started, has a tremendous force.\r\n\r\nLong after the transatlantic steamships were regularly running, sixteen\r\nor seventeen days was considered a good passage between New York\r\nand Liverpool. Then the Inman and White Star lines began to see the\r\nimportance of faster speed, and their rivalry had cut this estimate\r\nin two by 1870, and ten years later the Guion Line’s _Arizona_ and\r\nother crack boats took a full day off that. Since then there has been a\r\nsteady improvement in speed, as is shown by the table below; and this\r\nseems to have followed proportionately the steady increase in length.\r\nThe ships of 1850 never reached 300 feet in length, and few were over\r\n2300 tons in burden measurement. By 1880 almost all the first-class\r\n“liners” of the world exceeded 450 feet, and some soon approached\r\n600, as the _City of Rome_ (586 feet, 8826 tons), and several of the\r\nfamous Hamburg liners, White Stars, and Cunarders nearly equaled her\r\nin dimensions (_Paris_ and _New York_, 580 feet each; _Teutonic_ and\r\n_Majestic_, 582 feet); while some of the more recent boats are even\r\nlonger, as _Campania_ and _Lucania_, 620 feet, and the gigantic _Kaiser\r\nWilhelm der Grosse_, 648 feet. Two other ships, now planned, will\r\nconsiderably exceed this length. The total number of transatlantic\r\npassenger-steamships regularly sailing from New York alone is now\r\nbetween 90 and 100, belonging to 14 different lines. The table of\r\nspeed-records between New York and Queenstown, since the time was\r\nreduced to less than six days, is as follows:\r\n\r\n                                                        Time.\r\n  Year.

The fastest day’s run\r\n  on record, however, was made by the _Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse_,\r\n  of the Nord Deutscher Lloyds Line, averaging 22.35 knots (or\r\n  nautical miles, of 6080 feet each) per hour, equal to about 25½ land\r\n  miles. From Sandy Hook to Queenstown deduct 4 hours 22 minutes for\r\n  difference in time. Queenstown to Sandy Hook add 4 hours 22 minutes\r\n  for difference in time.\r\n\r\nThis eager rivalry in respect to speed, which insures not only a larger\r\nand more influential passenger service, but increased business in fast\r\nfreight and in the carriage of mail—both highly remunerative—is only\r\none feature of the sharp competition between these ocean carriers as to\r\nwhich shall offer the greatest advantages, and this is of benefit to\r\nthe public, though it has not greatly cheapened fares.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EMIGRANT PASSENGERS EMBARKING UPON A TRANSATLANTIC\r\n“LINER.”]\r\n\r\nMen travel far more now than they were wont in the time of “good Queen\r\nBess,” or even of our own grandfathers, and the few travelers for\r\npleasure of those days would scarcely believe their eyes if they could\r\nlook into the floating palaces—almost cities—in which we brave old\r\nocean now. A ship of one of the better passenger lines is a little\r\nworld in itself, containing almost all the appliances of the best\r\nmodern hotels on shore, and reducing the inevitable inconveniences of\r\nlife on shipboard by clever devices of every sort. In the one matter of\r\nventilation the ingenuity of the builders is particularly taxed. Money\r\nis spent lavishly in the finishing and furnishing of these great ships,\r\nnot to mention the expense of running them, which sometimes amounts in\r\ncost of fuel, food, and wages to $5000 a day.\r\n\r\nThe steamship lines between New York and Great Britain do not steer\r\nstraight across the Atlantic, but on their way to this country keep\r\nwell to the northward, so as to get to the west of the Gulf Stream, and\r\ninto the favorable current flowing south from Baffin’s Bay; then they\r\nskirt Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and Cape Cod. Going east, however,\r\nthe steamers—and sailing-vessels too—keep farther south, and work\r\nalong with the Gulf Stream as far as they can. From Europe to South\r\nAmerica, or through the Straits of Magellan on their way to the South\r\nSea islands or Australia (though this route is not often taken), or to\r\nthe Pacific coast of the Americas, vessels keep close down the African\r\ncoast, and then steer straight ahead from Guinea to Brazil, and on\r\ndown the American coast. (Put a map before you and you will understand\r\nthese courses better.) Sailing-vessels to Europe or the United States\r\nfrom Cape Horn, however, would swing far out into the South Atlantic\r\nto avoid heading against the southward coast-current and to get the\r\nbenefit of the southwest trade-wind and the equatorial currents.\r\nBetween New York and the Cape of Good Hope the track is nearly straight.\r\n\r\nIn the Pacific, the steamer-route between San Francisco or Vancouver\r\nand China and Japan, instead of being as direct as a parallel of\r\nlatitude, takes a southerly course when bound west, and a northerly\r\ncourse when bound east, the exact lines varying with the seasons as the\r\nprevailing winds and currents change. What these winds and currents\r\nare is explained in another chapter; but it is interesting to note\r\nthat there is a difference of many miles in the ordinary westerly and\r\neasterly courses, the latter being much the shorter, although the\r\nvessels of the Canadian Pacific Line often sail so far north with the\r\nJapan warm current as to sight the Aleutian Islands. Sailing-vessels,\r\nmoreover, curve so much farther south than steamers in going west from\r\nSan Francisco, in order to take advantage of the equatorial current and\r\nthe trade-winds, that the space is a thousand miles north and south\r\nbetween ships outward bound and those coming home. Between California\r\nand Honolulu a steamer takes a bee-line, but sailing-vessels find it\r\nbest to make detours. In summer, when outward bound, this amounts to\r\nsteering straight northward until under latitude forty degrees, before\r\nturning westward, making an angular course that looks very unnecessary\r\nto a landsman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A “WHALEBACK” FREIGHT STEAMER, ALSO ADAPTED TO PASSENGER\r\nSERVICE.]\r\n\r\nI have said that the finding of a sea-route to the East around the Cape\r\nof Good Hope was a great boon to western Europe, and advanced commerce.\r\nIt remained so until within the last seventy-five years. Lately,\r\nthe corsairs being out of the way, and safety guaranteed in Egypt,\r\nmerchants and sailors both began to wish they had a shorter route\r\nbetween England and India. Then, with immense labor and sacrifice, the\r\ncanal was cut across the Isthmus of Suez, and commerce returned to its\r\nancient channel through the Red Sea, saving thousands of miles of weary\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nFrom the end of the Red Sea at Aden, the tracks of steamers both\r\nways are straight courses to Bombay or Ceylon, and thence right up\r\nto Calcutta, across to Singapore, or down to Australia. Except East\r\nAfrican coast lines, few steamers go around the Cape of Good Hope\r\nfrom England, excepting one line to South Australia, which steers\r\nstraight eastward all the way from Cape Town to Adelaide, 6125 miles.\r\nBut the Indian Ocean is so situated under the equator, is so filled\r\nwith prevailing winds and currents and counter currents, that\r\nsailing-vessels must take very roundabout courses there, and can by no\r\nmeans steer the same track at all seasons of the year. These voyages\r\nfrom New York and London to the East are the longest regular sea-roads.\r\nA short table of distances between well-known ports along regular\r\nsteamer-routes will be of interest; and by reversing them, or adding\r\nthem together, the sailing distance between almost any two ports on the\r\nglobe may be calculated.\r\n\r\n                                            MILES.\r\n  Acapulco to San Francisco                 1,850\r\n  Aden to Bombay                            1,635\r\n  Aden to Colombo (Ceylon)                  2,100\r\n  Aden to Zanzibar                          1,770\r\n  Auckland to Honolulu                      3,915\r\n  Auckland to Suva (Fiji)                   1,140\r\n  Cadiz to Teneriffe (Canaries)               698\r\n  Cape Horn to Rio de Janeiro               2,350\r\n  Cape Town to Plymouth (Eng.)              6,016\r\n  Cork to St. John’s (N.

Such robbers on the high seas are termed pirates, and their\r\ncrime was visited by the old laws with torturing punishments; yet they\r\nwere never more daring than when the laws against them were severest.\r\n\r\nThe word is Greek, and the first pirates who figure in history are\r\nthose of the Greek and Byzantine islands and coasts—bloody ruffians\r\nwho originated the amusing method of disposing of unransomed prisoners\r\nby making them “walk the plank,” as has been done within the present\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe intricate channels and hidden harbors of the Ægean Sea long\r\nremained a hiding-place of sea-robbers, and are still haunted by\r\nthem, though every few years, from Cæsar’s time till now, the kings\r\nof the surrounding countries have sent expeditions to break them\r\nup. In the sixteenth century piracy in that region was especially\r\nprevalent. The crews then were chiefly Turkish, but the great leaders\r\nwere two renegade Greeks, the brothers Aruck and Hayradin Barbarossa\r\n(“Redbeard”).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WALKING THE PLANK.]\r\n\r\nIt happened that Spain, having conquered the Moors of Granada in 1492\r\nand pursued her victories across the straits, had gained control of\r\nAlgeria (at that time a collection of small Mohammedan states), and\r\nheld it until the death of King Ferdinand in 1516. Then the Algerians\r\nsent an embassy to Aruck (sometimes spelled Horuk, or Ouradjh)\r\nBarbarossa, requesting him to aid them in driving out the Spaniards,\r\nand promising him a share in the spoils. He eagerly accepted this\r\nproposition, seeing a great deal more in it than the Algerians saw;\r\nand the moment the Spaniards had been beaten and expelled he murdered\r\nthe prince he had come there to help, seized upon the city and port\r\nfor himself, and made it the headquarters of that system of desperate\r\npiracy which became the dread of all Europe. These robbers of the sea\r\ncalled themselves _corsairs_, from an Italian word signifying “a race”;\r\nand they generally won, because they had the best and swiftest vessels\r\nof that time, such as feluccas, xebecs, and the like. The black flag\r\nwhich they flew was not blacker than their reputations, so that even\r\nyet to call a man as bad as a Barbary pirate is to mean that he could\r\nnot be much worse if he tried. The Spanish colonies in America, a few\r\nyears later, began sending home immense treasures dug in the silver-and\r\ngold-mines of Peru and Mexico, and extorted from the natives or stolen\r\nfrom the temples of those unhappy countries. A quantity of ingots and\r\ngold and silver ornaments equal in value to fifteen million dollars\r\nof our modern money was taken at one time by Pizarro, in Peru, as the\r\nransom of the Inca Atahualpa, and booty amounting to a similar sum\r\nwas gained in the sacking of various cities. This great inpouring of\r\nwealth caused a general giving up of manufactures and trade in Spain,\r\nand was one of the reasons of her final decline in power, and it had\r\nthe immediate bad effect of making piracy more attractive than ever.\r\nThe treasure-ships, though convoyed by war-ships, were often attacked\r\nand captured by the corsairs. Barbarossa’s fleets were more like\r\narmadas of a powerful nation than mere pirate craft; and whenever it\r\nhappened that his commanders were defeated, they would land upon the\r\nnearest unprotected coast of Spain, France, or Italy, and pillage and\r\nburn some town in revenge. How galling this was to all merchants and\r\ntravelers we can hardly understand in these days; but so strong were\r\nthe corsairs that the fleets and armies of various governments, and\r\neven of the Pope, which were sent against them, could not gain their\r\nstronghold nor suppress their cruisers, at least for more than a short\r\ntime. Charles V of Spain tried greatly to conquer them; but although\r\nhis forces, attacking Aruck Barbarossa from the province of Oran, near\r\nAlgiers, defeated and killed him, Hayradin (more properly spelled\r\nKhair-ed-din) Barbarossa succeeded his brother, and, placing himself\r\nunder the protection of Turkey, continued to build up the power of\r\nthe pirates. His first care was to fortify the city of Algiers, and\r\nhe expended a great deal of money and labor on the perfection of the\r\nharbor, compelling all his prisoners and thousands of citizens to work\r\nas slaves on the defenses. Next he conquered Tunis, and was selected by\r\nthe sultan as the only fit man to sail against Andrea Doria, the great\r\nGenoese naval commander of the Christians in their wars against the\r\nTurks early in the sixteenth century. Mediterranean commerce became so\r\nunsafe that watch-towers were built all along the coasts, and guards\r\nwere kept afoot to give alarm at the approach of the corsairs. Charles\r\nV gathered together a powerful armament, and sailed to the rescue of\r\nTunis, recapturing it for its rightful sovereign in 1535; but he was\r\nnever able to capture Hayradin Barbarossa, who lived out his life in\r\nAlgiers as “a friend to the sea and an enemy to all who sailed upon\r\nit.” After his time the power of the pirates continued under other\r\nleaders; and not Algeria alone, but Tripoli, Morocco, and even Tunis,\r\nharbored piratical vessels in every port, and the rulers shared their\r\nspoils; piracy, indeed, was the source of their national revenues, and\r\nwas encouraged by the Sultan of Turkey inasmuch as all these states\r\nwere his vassals.\r\n\r\nEvery few years some European power—Spain, France, Venice, or\r\nEngland—would lose patience, send a fleet, and open a campaign that\r\nwould be successful in destroying certain strongholds, releasing a\r\ncrowd of prisoners, and burning or sinking many ships. The city of\r\nAlgiers was bombarded almost into ruins in 1682, and the job completed\r\na year later, after the Algerians had tossed the French consul out to\r\nthe fleet, with their compliments, from the mouth of a mortar. They\r\nwere fond of such jokes. Nevertheless, the city speedily recovered, and\r\npiracy, complicated by Moslem fanaticism and Turkish politics, harassed\r\ncommerce during all the next century, partly because Europe was so busy\r\nin its own wars that it had no time for outside matters, and partly\r\nbecause it was for the advantage of certain nations (particularly\r\nof Great Britain, which, in possession of Gibraltar and Port Mahon,\r\nmight have suppressed this villainy) to let the corsairs prey upon\r\nits foes—especially France. The actual result was that most or all of\r\nthe European powers fell into the custom of paying to Algiers, Tunis,\r\nTripoli, and other rulers of the Barbary (or Berber) States large sums\r\nof money as annual tribute to restrain them from official depredations\r\nupon their coasts and commerce, besides other large payments for the\r\nransom of such Christian prisoners as each sultan’s lively subjects\r\ncontinued to take in spite of treaties.\r\n\r\nIn this shameful condition of affairs the newly independent United\r\nStates was obliged to join during the first years of its existence, to\r\nsecure immunity for our commerce in the Mediterranean, because we had\r\nnot yet had time to create a navy. By the end of the century, however,\r\nthe United States was able to defend itself at sea, and in 1801\r\nanswered the insults of Tripoli by bombarding its capital seaport until\r\nthe dey sued for mercy and promised to behave himself. Nevertheless,\r\nhe needed another lesson, and in 1803 a second American fleet was sent\r\nto the Mediterranean, commanded by Preble, in the _Constitution_,\r\nwith such subordinate officers as Bainbridge, Decatur, Somers, Hull,\r\nStewart, Lawrence, and others that later became famous. One incident\r\nof this campaign, which began by frightening the Sultan of Morocco at\r\nTangier into abject submission, but was especially directed against\r\nTripoli, is well worth remembering.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “ARGUS” CAPTURING A TRIPOLITAN PIRATE FELUCCA.]\r\n\r\nCaptain Bainbridge, going alone in the fine frigate _Philadelphia_ into\r\nthe harbor of the city of Tripoli, had unfortunately run aground, and\r\nthere, overpowered by the number of his enemies afloat and ashore,\r\nhad been compelled to give up his ship, and find himself and all his\r\ncrew taken prisoners. He managed to get word of his misfortune to\r\nCommodore Preble at Malta, and that officer at once took his fleet to\r\nTripoli—Decatur, in the _Argus_, gallantly capturing on the way one\r\nof the great lateen-sailed piratical crafts of the enemy, which later\r\nproved a useful instrument in the contest. The fleet blockaded Tripoli\r\nfor a while, and shelled the fortifications somewhat, just to give the\r\nbashaw a hint, and to encourage the poor prisoners; but none of the big\r\nvessels was able to enter the narrow, tortuous, and ill-charted harbor\r\nin the face of the many batteries, under whose guns the _Philadelphia_\r\ncould be seen at anchor with the Tripolitan flag at her main, so they\r\nsailed away to Syracuse to make preparations for reducing this nest of\r\nbarbarians. Gunboats of light draft and mortar-vessels had to be fitted\r\nout; but the first thing was to try to carry out a plan that Decatur\r\nand all his friends had been maturing ever since they had arrived—the\r\ndestruction of the _Philadelphia_, not only because she had been\r\nrefitted into a powerful weapon in the hands of the enemy, but because\r\nit was galling to national as well as naval pride to see her flying a\r\nforeign flag. The plan was this:\r\n\r\nDecatur was to take a picked crew of seventy officers and men on\r\nthe captured felucca (renamed _Intrepid_), and attempt at night to\r\npenetrate to the inner harbor of Tripoli in the disguise of a trader,\r\nsupported as well as possible by the gun-brig _Siren_, also disguised\r\nas a merchantman. As his pilot was an Italian and a competent linguist,\r\nit was hoped the ketch could get near enough to set fire to the ship,\r\nwhirl a shotted deck-gun into position to send a shell down the main\r\nhatch and through her bottom, fire it, and escape before the surprise\r\nwas over. The chances of failure were enough to daunt the bravest, yet\r\nevery man in the fleet wanted to go.\r\n\r\nOn February 15, 1804, Decatur in his felucca, and Somers commanding the\r\nbrig, found themselves, toward evening, again in sight of the town,\r\nwith its circle of forts crowned by the frowning castle. The great\r\n_Philadelphia_ stood out in bold relief, closely surrounded by two\r\nfrigates and more than twenty gunboats and galleys. From the castle and\r\nbatteries 115 guns could be trained upon an attacking force, besides\r\nthe fire of the vessels, yet the bold tars on the _Intrepid_ did not\r\nquail.\r\n\r\nThe crew having been sent below, the pilot Catalona took the wheel,\r\nwhile Decatur stood beside him, disguised as a common sailor. It\r\nwas now nine o’clock, and bright moonlight. Standing steadily in,\r\nthey rounded to close by the _Philadelphia_, and, boldly hailing her\r\ndeck-watch, asked the privilege of mooring to her chains for the night,\r\nexplaining that they had lost their anchors in the late storm, and so\r\nforth, until at last consent was given.\r\n\r\nHaving dragged themselves close to the frigate, it was the work of only\r\na moment to board her with a rush, overpower her surprised crew, and\r\nmake sure of her destruction by means of the combustibles and powder\r\nthey had brought with them. Before their task was done, however, they\r\nhad been discovered, and it is almost a miracle that they were able to\r\nreturn to their felucca, and make their way out of the harbor, through\r\na rain of harmless cannon-balls; yet they did so, and Decatur was\r\njustly honored for one of the most gallant exploits in naval annals.\r\n\r\nA few weeks later Preble’s squadron shelled the pirate city and\r\nfortresses into ruin, forced Tripoli as well as Algiers and Tunis\r\nto respect them and thenceforth the American flag, and gave these\r\narrogant rulers the new sensation of paying instead of receiving money\r\nfor bad deeds. It put an end to the corsairs.\r\n\r\nTurkish and Barbary pirates were not the only ones in the world,\r\nhowever. Although the old Norwegian vikings and rough Norman barons did\r\nnot go under that name, they were scarcely anything else, in fact, as\r\nthe neighboring peoples could testify, though this was far back before\r\nmodern history began. But when the Spaniards and the French began\r\nto colonize the West Indies, and to dig mines in South and Central\r\nAmerica, not only were the Barbary corsairs given a fresh incentive,\r\nbut a new set of pirates sprang up, the most daring that the world has\r\never seen.\r\n\r\nAs the archipelago east of Greece had sheltered the hordes of the\r\nTurkish sea-robbers, so the many islands, crooked channels, reefs\r\nunknown to all but the local pilots, small harbors, and abundant food\r\nof the Antilles, made the West Indies the safest place in the world\r\nfor pirates to pursue their work. To these new and wild regions, in\r\nthe sixteenth century, had flocked desperados and adventurers from all\r\nover the world. When the wars with their chances of plunder died out\r\nafter the campaigns led by Cortés, Pizarro, Balboa, and the rest of the\r\nSpanish _conquistadores_, many ruffians seized upon vessels by force,\r\nor stole them, and turned into robbers of the sea. At first, as a\r\nrule, they had farms and families on some island, and went freebooting\r\nonly a portion of the year. The island of Hayti, or Santo Domingo,\r\nwas then settled by farmers, hunters, and cattlemen, the last-named\r\nof whom, mainly French, passed most of their time in the interior of\r\nthe island, capturing, herding, or killing half-wild cattle and hogs.\r\nBut the monopolies which Spain imposed upon the colonists interfered\r\nwith the market for their produce and induced an illicit trade, which\r\nled to frequent encounters with the Spanish navy. As the constant wars\r\nbetween Spain and France and England increased the difficulties of\r\ntrade, large numbers of the colonists joined the freebooters, who then\r\nbecame extremely numerous and formidable, losing their old name and\r\nbecoming known by that of the cattlemen—buccaneers, from the French\r\nword _boucanier_.\r\n\r\nFirst Santo Domingo, then Tortugas, and finally Jamaica were\r\nheadquarters of the buccaneers, who were made up of men of all nations,\r\nunited by a desire to prey upon Spain as a common enemy. They were\r\nthousands in number, possessed large fleets of ships and boats, were\r\nwell armed, and finally formed a regular organization with a chief and\r\nunder-officers. The most noted of these chiefs, perhaps, was Henry\r\nMorgan, a Welshman, who was at one time captured and taken home to\r\nEngland for trial. To his own surprise, instead of being executed,\r\nhe was knighted by Charles II, who had not been at all grieved at\r\nseeing Spanish commerce harassed; and Morgan was returned to Jamaica\r\nas commissioner of admiralty, where at one time he acted as deputy\r\ngovernor, using his opportunity to make it unpleasant for those of\r\nthe buccaneers with whom he had formerly had disagreements as to the\r\ndistribution of prizes.\r\n\r\nThe earlier buccaneers found ample plunder in the Spanish fleets. They\r\npatrolled the sea in the track of vessels bound to and from Europe, and\r\nseized them, allowing or compelling the crews to become pirates, or\r\nelse to be killed or carried into slavery. This work, however, employed\r\nonly a portion of the buccaneers; and early in the seventeenth century,\r\nas the commerce of Spain declined, it became too uncertain a means of\r\nwealth to suit them. But the rich Spanish settlements still remained;\r\nand often, therefore, they equipped a great fleet, enlisted men under\r\ncertain strict rules as to sharing the spoils, and sailed away to\r\npillage some coast. There was hardly an island in the West Indies from\r\nwhich, in this way, they did not extort immense sums of money under\r\nthreat of destruction of the people. The mainland also suffered from\r\nthe marauders. Great cities, like Cartagena in Venezuela, Panama on\r\nthe Isthmus, Mérida in Yucatan, and Havana in Cuba, were attacked\r\nby armies of buccaneers numbering thousands of men. Sometimes their\r\nfortifications held good, and the enemy was beaten back; but sooner or\r\nlater all these cities, and others, smaller, were captured, robbed of\r\neverything valuable that they contained, and burned or partly burned.\r\n\r\nFor years the buccaneers were the terror of the Caribbean region, and\r\nafter the famous sacking of Panama, under Morgan, in 1671, their power\r\nspread across the Isthmus and scourged the southern seas. We have no\r\nway of knowing the amount of the treasure which they captured from the\r\nmerchant vessels and from the coast of Peru; for the moment they got\r\nhome from an expedition they wasted all their booty in wild carousing,\r\nso that the spoils earned by months of exposure, and wounds, and danger\r\nof death, would be spent in a single week.\r\n\r\nAt last even England and France, after secretly favoring the\r\nbuccaneers, became roused to the necessity of controlling them, and\r\nit was with this object in view that a certain Captain William Kidd\r\nwas fitted out at private expense toward the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, and armed with King William’s commission for seizing pirates\r\nand making reprisals, England being at war with France. Just why it\r\nwas, nobody has explained, but Captain Kidd spent his time in loitering\r\naround the coast of Africa, where no pirates were to be found, until he\r\ngrew quite disheartened, and, fearing to be dismissed by his employers\r\nand to be “mark’d out for an unlucky man,” he started a little pirate\r\nbusiness for himself, in which he gained more of a certain kind of\r\nfame than any of the rest; for popular tradition supposes him to have\r\nhoarded his booty and buried it. “Captain Kidd’s treasure” has been\r\nsought for until the whole eastern coast of the United States is\r\nhoneycombed with diggings for it; but probably he had eaten and drunk\r\nit up before 1701, when he was captured and executed in England. About\r\nthis time, however, and without his valuable aid, the combined naval\r\nforces of all the nations interested in the commerce of the New World\r\nbroke the power of the buccaneers, and their depredations ceased. Their\r\nstory is one of the wildest, most romantic, and most terrible in the\r\nhistory of the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  “In revel and carousing\r\n  We gave the New Year housing,\r\n  With wreckage for our firing,\r\n  And rum to heart’s desiring.”\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe trade of piracy was carried on during the eighteenth century in the\r\nregion of the West Indies by unorganized bands of desperados who had\r\nall the faults and none of the greatness of the men they succeeded, and\r\nwho received little attention from the world at large. At the beginning\r\nof the nineteenth century the Barataria pirates came into notice on\r\nthe coast of Louisiana, taking the place of the buccaneers, but in a\r\nmuch smaller way. Their leaders, Pierre and John Lafitte, carried on\r\nbusiness quite openly in New Orleans; and their settlements on the\r\nmarshy islands along the coast, and their “temple,” to which persons\r\ncame out from the city to buy goods, were open secrets. But in the\r\nWar of 1812, although the British tried to buy their services, they\r\nredeemed themselves by standing true to the American government, which\r\nhad just been trying to exterminate them, and so they won public pardon\r\nand an added glamour of romance.\r\n\r\nFor the same reasons as those in the case of other island systems, the\r\nEast Indies have always been infested with pirates, whose light, swift\r\nvessels run in and out of the intricate channels among the dangerous\r\ncoral reefs, where government cruisers dare not follow, while the\r\npeople on shore sympathize more with the pirates than with the police.\r\n\r\nThe East Indian sea-robbers are, as a rule, natives of that\r\nregion—Malays, Borneans, Dyaks, and Chinese, with many half-savages\r\nof the South Sea Islands. This is more like a continuance of savage\r\nresistance to civilization than real piracy, since the pirates of the\r\nAtlantic are civilized sailors in mutiny against their own people\r\nand national commerce. The result is just as bad, however; for these\r\nEast Indians are as bloodthirsty and cruel as the others, and if they\r\ndo not kill their victims, or save them for some cannibal feast (as\r\nwould probably happen in the New Hebrides and some other islands),\r\nthey condemn them to a life of misery. But in these days of improved\r\nsea-craft, piracy, even in Malayan waters, is weak. Our consuls and\r\ngovernment agents watch suspicious vessels; our telegraph warns the\r\nnaval authorities in a moment; our steam-cruisers outspeed the swiftest\r\ncraft of the black flag; our rifled guns silence their cheap artillery;\r\nand our coast surveys furnish maps so accurate that the pirate no\r\nlonger holds the secret of channels and harbors where he can safely\r\nretreat. If, therefore, the old “Redbeards” should come back to life\r\nand try to be kings of the sea, as they rejoiced to be a couple of\r\ncenturies ago, their pride would soon be humbled, and they would gladly\r\nreturn to their graves and their ancient glory.\r\n\r\nThere is a form of sea-roving which has been at times not very\r\ndifferent from piracy; it is called _privateering_, and history shows\r\na good many cases where it has degenerated into sea-robbery pure and\r\nsimple.\r\n\r\nA privateer is a ship, owned by a private citizen or citizens, to which\r\nauthority is given by a government to act as an independent war-vessel.\r\nIts commission is called a “letter of marque” (_lettre de marque_ in\r\nFrench), entitling it to “take, burn, and destroy” a certain enemy’s\r\nproperty on the sea or in its ports. It has no right, of course, to\r\nattack any one else.\r\n\r\nThe object and plea of the government issuing commissions to privateers\r\nis that thus a great many more armed vessels can be sent afloat\r\nthan the government has money to equip, and that consequently far\r\nmore damage will be done to the enemy, by crippling his trade and\r\nresources, than regular men-of-war alone can accomplish. Private\r\ncapital has been willing to take the risk because rewarded by a large\r\nshare of the prizes; and from the end of the fifteenth to the middle of\r\nthe eighteenth century this was one of the most profitable of marine\r\nindustries, for then nearly universal wars made almost any capture\r\nlegitimate. In the earlier times even the limited regulation that came\r\nlater was absent, and there was small choice between a privateer and\r\na pirate. Queen Elizabeth found the hundreds of privateers which she\r\nhad commissioned against the Spanish and Dutch preying upon her own\r\npeople, and robbing fishermen, coasters, and small shore towns, to such\r\nan extent that she had to suppress them as bandits. Those were the\r\ntimes when Hawkins could use a royal fleet to wage war upon the Spanish\r\ncolonies for private reasons; and when his ablest lieutenant, Drake,\r\ncould make his notable journey around the world a history of robbery\r\nand slaughter. On the west coast of South America he spent months in\r\ndestroying Spanish vessels and ravaging and burning settlements; yet\r\nit was thought remarkable, when he returned from his circumnavigation\r\nof the globe, that the Queen hesitated somewhat before recognizing his\r\ngreat achievements as a seaman, for fear of complications with Spain!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MALAY PIRATES ATTACKING A STEAMER.]\r\n\r\nSpain, in those days of first harvest from her American possessions\r\nand the East Indies, was the prey of everybody on the high seas able\r\nto rob her, and formalities were joyously disregarded by both sides.\r\nHer galleons carried precious cargoes of spices, silks, and East India\r\ngoods around the Cape, and brought silver ingots and gold bars from the\r\nSpanish Main. They were usually convoyed by regular war-ships, and had\r\nto run the gantlet of the enemy’s fleets whenever Spain happened to be\r\nopenly at war with somebody, as was usually the case; and otherwise\r\nmust escape buccaneers in West Indian waters, Malayan and Chinese\r\npirates in the far East, and irregular sea-rovers along the West\r\nAfrican coast, while the corsairs made the Mediterranean route doubly\r\ndangerous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAUL JONES’ FIGHT IN THE “BON HOMME RICHARD” WITH THE\r\n“SERAPIS.”]\r\n\r\nThe gradual growth of organized navies, the development of\r\ninternational law, and the increasing organization of the civilized\r\nworld generally, slowly tamed these wild practices and reduced\r\nprivateering to some sort of control. Thus Jean Bart, the popular\r\nhero of French naval history, who flourished toward the end of the\r\nseventeenth century, was recognized and supported by the French monarch\r\nas a free-lance in the Mediterranean, because his humble birth\r\nprohibited him from taking a commission in the regular navy, which\r\namounted to a sort of apology for his deeds.\r\n\r\nDuring the wars of the United States with England privateering was\r\nextensively practised on both sides, and was of especial value to the\r\nAmericans. Congress issued private commissions as early as March,\r\n1776, and the ablest statesmen upheld it as a means of employing the\r\nships, capital, and thousands of seamen that must lie idle when the\r\nenemy’s cruisers were ranging the ocean highways unless permitted to\r\narm themselves and assist the government in an irregular warfare,\r\ntrusting to the value of their captures for remuneration. That the\r\nchance of such reward was enough inducement is shown by the fact that\r\nduring the first year of the Revolution nearly three hundred and fifty\r\nBritish vessels were captured, chiefly West Indiamen, worth, with their\r\ncargoes, five million dollars. As Great Britain did not recognize\r\nthe flag of the United States, not only these, but even our regular\r\nnaval officers, were regarded by them as pirates, rather than true\r\nprivateers—Paul Jones first of all; but she never acted on this theory\r\nwith the severity that would have been visited upon true pirates.\r\n\r\nIn the naval warfare that came later between the United States and\r\nFrance, privateering again flourished, and was a source of immense\r\nprofit to the principal seaports whence these swift, effective Yankee\r\nvessels were despatched. No less than three hundred and sixty-five\r\nAmerican privateers were sent out between 1789 and 1799, and swept the\r\nseas almost clean of the French merchant flag.\r\n\r\nThen came the second war with Great Britain, which was fought over\r\na question of the sea rather than of the land,—the right of search\r\nclaimed by the British,—and once more American and British privateers\r\nswarmed upon the highways of commerce. Of our merchant ships in all\r\nparts of the world, about five hundred were lost; but this was more\r\nthan paid for, since our two hundred and fifty privateers captured or\r\ndestroyed, during the three years and nine months of the conflict, no\r\nless than sixteen hundred British merchant vessels of all classes.\r\n\r\nThis disparity of results was largely due to the greater number of\r\nEnglish merchant vessels, but is also to be credited to the superior\r\nspeed and handiness of the Yankee vessels, most of which were\r\n“Baltimore clippers,” topsail-rigged schooners with raking masts, that\r\ncould outsail and out-manœuver anything afloat. “They usually carried\r\nfrom six to ten guns, with a single long one, which was called ‘Long\r\nTom,’ mounted on a swivel in the center. They were usually manned with\r\nfifty persons besides officers, all armed with muskets, cutlasses, and\r\nboarding-pikes.”\r\n\r\nAn English writer, Mr. R. C. Leslie, is of the opinion that this type\r\nof vessel grew out of models in vogue in the West Indies, long before,\r\nfor the small piratical craft that made those waters the terror of\r\ntravelers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DRAWN BY W. TABER.        ENGRAVED BY HENRY WOLF.\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES FRIGATE “CONSTELLATION” OVERHAULING THE SLAVER “CORA.”]\r\n\r\nThese Baltimore clippers, too, enlarged and square-rigged, but still\r\nthe fastest things on the western ocean, formed the craft with which\r\nthe slave-trade was continued between Africa and America long after\r\nit had been condemned by the civilized world. For many years previous\r\nto the American Civil War, which put an end to the larger part of the\r\ntraffic by destroying its market, England and the United States kept\r\nsquadrons patrolling the African coast to arrest the slavers and free\r\ntheir “cargoes.”\r\n\r\nWhat wild, wild tales of the sea do these reminiscences of piracy,\r\nprivateering, and the slave-chase bring to mind—tales of horror, and\r\nyet full of such deeds of daring and romance and fierce delight as must\r\nstir the heart in spite of brain and conscience!\r\n\r\nPirates are things of the past—no more to be feared except in a small\r\nway in the Malayan and Chinese archipelagoes. The African slave-trade\r\nis extinct, so far as shipment across the ocean is concerned, save\r\nwhere, now and then, an Arab dhow steals with its black cargo along\r\nthe East African foreland, or flits across the Gulf of Aden or the Red\r\nSea. Privateering has been forbidden by international treaty among the\r\nlarger European powers, which now recognize that trade goods, even\r\nof belligerents, must be held safe in the ships of neutrals (except\r\narticles declared contraband of war), because the business of the\r\nworld cannot stop, or even be put in jeopardy, by a quarrel between\r\ntwo nations. Privateering, therefore, has been abandoned in Europe\r\nas a method of war since the treaty of Paris in 1856, though Prussia\r\ncame pretty near it in 1870, by organizing what she called a volunteer\r\nfleet, and Spain reserves the privilege of commissioning privateers.\r\n\r\nThe United States, however, and some other countries whose policy\r\nor ability forbid them to have a large navy, would not enter into\r\nthe European agreement above mentioned, mutually to abstain from\r\nprivateering, on the plea that to do so would be to yield the most\r\npowerful weapon of a nation weak in naval armament and sea commerce,\r\nagainst any of many possible enemies whose large sea-borne commerce\r\nwould expose it to the most serious wounds. In our Civil War the\r\nPresident issued no letters of marque, although authorized to do so.\r\nIt was customary to speak of the Confederate cruisers _Alabama_,\r\n_Shenandoah_, _Florida_, etc., as privateers, or even pirates, and\r\nthey actually played the part with a success woeful to us of the\r\nNorth, and to Great Britain, which had to pay for the damages caused\r\nby the _Alabama_; but, strictly speaking, they were neither, because\r\ncommissioned by a temporary but regular government, whose flag might\r\nhave been recognized if its arms had succeeded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cannon.]\r\n\r\nMore lately (1898) the United States has announced it as its policy to\r\nrefrain from privateering, though no formal signature has been given to\r\nany international agreement to that effect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  STEAM YACHT. “HALCYON.” SANDY HOOK LIGHT-SHIP. “VOLUNTEER.”\r\n  “MAYFLOWER.”\r\n\r\nA SPIN OUT TO SEA.—WELL-KNOWN YACHTS ROUNDING THE SANDY HOOK LIGHT-SHIP.\r\n\r\n(From the painting by J. O. Davidson, owned by F. A. Hammond, Esq.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nYACHTING AND PLEASURE-BOATING\r\n\r\n\r\nYacht is a word derived from the Dutch language, which has given to\r\nthe English so many of its sea-terms, meaning, originally, a fast\r\nboat, such as was built for chasing pirates and smugglers, and, later,\r\na pleasure-boat. The latter meaning alone is now kept in view by the\r\nword, which is properly applied to anything designed and used for\r\npleasure-sailing, whether moved by sails, steam, or electricity.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain, where yachting, as we now understand it, arose, it\r\nwas not until about 1650 that races between pleasure craft began to\r\nbe sailed on the Thames and in the quiet waters about the Isle of\r\nWight, while the first yacht-club was not formed until 1720 (at Cork,\r\nin Ireland). Even then, a century elapsed before yachting as a sport\r\nattracted much attention even among the British, famous for their love\r\nof the sea. In 1812 a “yacht-club” was founded at Cowes, in the Isle\r\nof Wight. It received a new impetus and became the “Royal Yacht-Club”\r\nin 1817, the Prince Regent having joined it, and in 1833 was again\r\nreorganized by King William III as the “Royal Yacht Squadron,” the\r\ndesignation it bears to-day. It carried on races, or regattas, as they\r\nsoon came to be called (borrowing from the Italians a term descriptive\r\nof the old Venetian gondola races), but all sorts of cruising-boats\r\nwere matched against one another, classified by a tonnage rule with no\r\nallowances for size or any of the systems by which contestants are now\r\nclassified and equalized.\r\n\r\nBy this time, however, there was peace on the North Atlantic, and many\r\na good seaman was free to turn his attention to enjoying and improving\r\nthe tools of his profession. By this time, also, the Americans had made\r\ngreat headway as ship-builders and seamen, and by rivalry with the\r\nOld World for trade, and by experience in the Newfoundland fisheries\r\nand the West Indies fruit-trade, had acquired a skill in building and\r\nrigging ships that astonished the world by their speed and weatherly\r\nqualities. It was natural that these ideas should influence pleasure\r\ncraft on this side of the water, as Great Britain’s long sea-struggles\r\nhad influenced its sailors; and when, in 1844, the New York Yacht-Club\r\nwas founded, the conditions were favorable for beginning that home\r\ndevelopment of yachting as a sport which was soon to place the\r\nAmericans and Canadians among the leading yachting peoples of the\r\nworld, and to lead to those international tests of speed that nowadays\r\nexcite so wide-spread and intense an interest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “AMERICA” (AS ORIGINALLY RIGGED) AND “MARIA.”]\r\n\r\nThe great preponderance in numbers and value of pleasure-vessels in\r\nthe United States, and in the number of clubs and club-members, is due\r\nnot only to our large population and long coast-line, but to the great\r\nextent of inland waters furnished by our rivers and interior lakes, and\r\nto the prevalence of bays or protected lagoons, such as Narragansett\r\nBay, the Great South Bay of Long Island, New York harbor, Delaware\r\nand Chesapeake bays, and the long series of “sounds” that border the\r\nsouthern Atlantic coast from Barnegat to Biscayne. The Great Lakes are\r\nbordered by yacht-clubs on both sides, and furnish space and weather\r\nfor quite as serious work as tries the skill of ocean navigators,\r\nwhile a hundred smaller lakes make fine pleasure-waters and excellent\r\ntraining-grounds for fresh-water sailors.\r\n\r\nThough the first regatta in America was sailed in 1845, little over\r\nhalf a century ago, the evolution of American yachts began with the\r\nbuilding of the sloop _Maria_ by Robert L. Stevens, one of that family\r\nof remarkable inventors, who had already devised the first practical\r\nscrew-steamer, and afterward created the _Monitor_. Her model, as we\r\nlearn from an excellent article in “The Century” for July, 1882, by S.\r\nG. W. Benjamin, was suggested by the low, broad, almost flat-bottomed\r\nsloops employed to steal over the shallows of the Hudson and the\r\nSound—vessels depending upon beam rather than on ballast for stability,\r\nand imitated by many of our coasters, which are so stiff that they\r\nsometimes make outside voyages without either cargo or ballast; but\r\nthe _Maria_ had a long, sharp, hollowed bow, whence she expanded aft,\r\nwith little taper at the stern, so that her deck-plan was that of an\r\nelongated flat-iron. The principal novelty about her, however, was the\r\nuse of two “center-boards.”\r\n\r\nA center-board is a plate of wood or metal, suspended, usually by a\r\ncorner pivot, within a sheath or box in the waist, which can be let\r\ndown through the keel into the water, so as to form an adjustable keel.\r\nIt is the most convenient form of a very old device for preventing a\r\nboat’s drift to leeward, or tendency to capsize under the pressure of\r\nthe wind. In earliest times, a mat was hung over the side. Later this\r\nwas replaced by the leeboard, apparently a Dutch invention, which may\r\nstill be seen on the canal barges in Holland, and which was a feature\r\nof the pirogues or periaugers (shallow double-ended sailing-canoes)\r\nthat in early times formed almost the only type of small sail-boat in\r\nNew York waters. Two other novel, foreshadowing features possessed by\r\nMr. Stevens’ boat, were the use of rubber compressors on the traveler\r\nof the main boom to ease the strain of the sheet (rubber is applied in\r\nmany places about modern rigging), and the bolting of lead to the keel\r\nas outside ballast.\r\n\r\nThe _Maria_ justified the expectations aroused by these and other\r\nnovelties in hull and rig by beating everything in existence, until\r\na Swedish gentleman in New York constructed a much smaller boat, the\r\n_Coquette_, on very different lines, for although only sixty-six feet\r\nlong she drew ten feet of water; and in a match on the open sea she\r\nbeat the _Maria_ easily, showing the superiority of the deep-keeled\r\nmodel for windy weather.\r\n\r\nProfiting by these experiences and widely gathered information, a new\r\ndesigner essayed the task of making a still better yacht. This was\r\nGeorge Steers, the son of a British naval captain and ship-modeler,\r\nwho had become an American naval officer and was the first man to\r\ntake charge of the Washington navy yard. He built several graceful\r\nand fleet-winged sloops, famous in their day, such as the _Julia_,\r\nDavid Carl’s _Gracie_, and many pilot-boats and ships. His most\r\ncelebrated production, however, and the one which gave our yachtsmen\r\nan international reputation and established their method of pursuing\r\nrecreation as the foremost American sport, was the _America_, from\r\nwhich the “America Cup” races take origin and name.\r\n\r\nThe origin was really accidental. When the first World’s Fair was to be\r\nheld at the Crystal Palace in London, one of the attendant festivities\r\nwas a great national gathering of British yachts in their favorite\r\nharbor, Cowes, at which, it was announced, foreign yachtsmen were to be\r\nwelcome, especially Americans. In preparation for it, John C. Stevens,\r\nof Hoboken, then Commodore of the New York Yacht-Club, and some of his\r\nfriends, ordered a new yacht from George Steers with which to cross\r\nthe Atlantic and meet the English racers. This new boat, completed in\r\nthe spring of 1851, and named _America_, was schooner-rigged, but had\r\nraking masts, no topsails except a small main gaff, and only one jib,\r\nwhose foot was laced to a boom. Such was the style of the day; but\r\nlater she was changed in rig so as to carry far more and bigger sails,\r\nmore like those of a modern schooner-yacht.\r\n\r\nThe moment she arrived in Cowes, in the early summer of 1851, her\r\nsuperiority in speed was conceded, and no British captain would consent\r\nto meet her; but finally a match was extemporized, open to all nations,\r\nfor which a prize was offered in the form of a cup presented by the\r\nRoyal Yacht Squadron—not by the Queen, as usually said. Fifteen yachts\r\nresponded, but none showed what it could do, for there was little wind,\r\nand the cup was awarded to the _America_ more in general acknowledgment\r\nof its excellence than because of any great performance there. Not\r\nmuch importance was attached to the incident, but the silver tankard\r\nwas brought home and left to ornament Commodore Stevens’ drawing-room\r\nuntil 1857, when its owners dedicated it to the purpose of a perpetual\r\nchallenge cup, in charge of the New York Yacht-Club, for international\r\nraces under specified conditions. Fifteen years elapsed, however,\r\nbefore the first contestant appeared.\r\n\r\nThe _America_ had differed prominently in shape from all her opponents\r\nat Cowes, by having fine hollowed bows and a wide stern, instead of\r\nthe bluff bows and narrowing after part—the “cod’s head and mackerel’s\r\ntail” pattern—of English craft; she also had sails that hung very flat\r\ninstead of bellying out under the wind as was the foreign style. In\r\nthese directions British yachtsmen saw good, and tried to improve; but\r\nthey would have nothing to do with center-boards, and clung to their\r\ncutter-rig. We, on the other hand, had gained ideas as to improving\r\nrig, especially in the schooners, and in the bestowal of ballast,\r\noutside and in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FROM A PHOTOGRAPH BY G. WEST & SON, SOUTHSEA, ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n“GENESTA,” “TARA,” AND “IREX”—THE BRITISH TYPE OF CUTTER OF 1884-85.\r\n\r\n“Galatea,” 1885, belonged to the same type.]\r\n\r\nAt length, in 1870, an English schooner, the _Cambria_, came over to\r\ncompete for the cup, and was pitted against a fleet of crack yachts\r\noff Sandy Hook; but again the wind was so light that the boats did\r\nlittle more than drift. The Englishman, nevertheless, was outdrifted\r\nby nine others, and the leader was the little sloop _Magic_, which\r\nbecame the custodian of the cup. The next year, however, another\r\nchallenge was received, and the British keel-yacht _Livonia_ appeared\r\nand was defeated by the American keel-schooner _Sappho_, which, under\r\na new rule, had won her right to defend the cup by first beating\r\nin preparatory ocean races all other rivals for the honor. As this\r\ncontest was between single representative yachts, tried in five races,\r\nand in all sorts of weather, it was a fair and conclusive measure of\r\ncomparative qualities. The next yacht to come after the international\r\ncup was the Canadian _Countess of Dufferin_, which was promptly\r\ndefeated by the _Magic_ in 1876. Five years later another Canadian\r\nappeared, the _Atalanta_, differing from previous contestants in being\r\na single-masted center-board yacht; but her rigging and finish were\r\nso bad that her excellent model could not save her from defeat (1881)\r\nat the hands of the elegant iron sloop _Mischief_ which had been built\r\nespecially for the race, and had won her foremost place through severe\r\ntrial races, as before.\r\n\r\nUp to this time, as Mr. W. P. Stephens tells us in “The Century”\r\nfor August, 1893, whence many of the portraits of these racers have\r\nbeen taken, no pleasure-boats had been built except after the rule\r\nof thumb—some practical sailor whittled out a model according to his\r\nideas, and the builder followed it.\r\n\r\n  Systematic designing was unknown, and ... one type of yacht was in\r\n  general use, the wide, shoal center-board craft, with high trunk\r\n  cabin, large open cockpit, ballast all inside (and of iron, or even\r\n  slag and stone), and a heavy and clumsy wooden construction. Faulty\r\n  in every way as this type has since been proved, in the absence of\r\n  any different standard it was considered perfect, and open doubts\r\n  were expressed of the patriotism if not the sanity of the few\r\n  American yachtsmen who, about 1877, called into question the merits\r\n  of the American center-board sloop, and pointed out the opposing\r\n  qualities of the British cutter—her non-capsizability, due to the\r\n  use of lead ballast outside of the hull; her speed in rough water;\r\n  and the superiority of her rig both in proportions and in mechanical\r\n  details.\r\n\r\n  A wordy warfare over these types raged for several years, gaining\r\n  strength with the building of the first true English cutter, the\r\n  _Muriel_, in New York in 1878, and bearing good fruit a year later\r\n  in the launching of the _Mischief_, an American center-board sloop,\r\n  but modified in accordance with the new theories. The plumb stem, the\r\n  straight sheer, and higher free-board, with quite a shapely though\r\n  short overhang, suggested the hull of the cutter, and though quite\r\n  wide—nearly twenty feet on sixty-one feet water-line—she drew nearly\r\n  six feet. Even with her sloop rig she was a marked departure from\r\n  the older boats of her class, especially as she was built of iron in\r\n  place of wood, and consequently carried her ballast, all lead, at a\r\n  very low point.\r\n\r\nOne of the results of this controversy was the sending to this country,\r\nfrom Scotland, of a little ten-ton racing cutter, the _Madge_, purely\r\nto show what capabilities lay in “a deep, narrow, lead-keeled craft\r\nwith the typical cutter rig.” The only American able to beat her was\r\nthe _Shadow_, a famous Herreshoff sloop of unusual depth, and she did\r\nit but once. Nevertheless, the controversy was not decided in the\r\nUnited States, and the Britishers thought it worth while to try to\r\ngive us another lesson. In 1884 they launched two big cutters, _Irex_\r\nand _Genesta_, and in 1885 a third, _Galatea_; and Sir Richard Sutton,\r\nowner of _Genesta_, and Lieutenant William Henn, R. N., owner of\r\n_Galatea_, challenged for the America Cup.\r\n\r\nThen the question arose: What should be done to meet them? The British\r\ncutters differed from those previously met, in that they were built\r\nfor racing, not for general use—were “racing machines” instead of\r\ncruising-yachts. To meet this, a scientific designer of marine vessels,\r\nMr. A. Cary Smith of New York, was called upon to produce a moderately\r\ndeep, center-board, iron sloop-yacht on the lines of the _Mischief_,\r\nbut much larger, and he produced the _Priscilla_. But while she was\r\nbuilding there was quietly begun another yacht, the _Puritan_, owned\r\nand built in Boston from designs by an almost unheard-of architect, Mr.\r\nEdward Burgess, who previously to this performance had been renowned\r\nonly as a student of insects!\r\n\r\n“The stout oak keel of the new _Puritan_ was laid upon a lead keel of\r\ntwenty-seven tons, carried down into a deep projecting keel; the plumb\r\nstem, the sheer, and the long counter suggested the British cutter\r\nrather than the American sloop; the draft of eight feet six inches was\r\ngreatly in excess of all of the old center-board boats, and the rig was\r\nessentially that of the cutter rather than of the sloop.”\r\n\r\nA struggle decided that she was better than the _Priscilla_, and in\r\nthe cup races in September she proved herself better than the famous\r\nEnglish cutter _Genesta_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CUTTER “MURIEL,” SHOWING THE ENGLISH DEEP-DRAFT TYPE\r\nOF BUILD AND RIG.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when the _Galatea_, whose challenge had been postponed\r\nuntil 1886, came out, the _Puritan_ had already been distanced by\r\nan American rival, the _Mayflower_, practically a larger copy of\r\nherself, as _Galatea_ was of _Genesta_, and, therefore, a lead-keeled\r\ncenter-board boat, having a cutter-like rig. Trial races showed that\r\nthe _Mayflower_ was able to beat all her beautiful predecessors, and\r\nagain the British contestant was obliged to take a defeat and leave the\r\nprize in New York.\r\n\r\nThe result of this last contest (1886) was to cause British yachtsmen\r\nto abandon their old tonnage rule of measurement and adopt the far\r\nbetter modern one of load-line and sail-area measurement. Another\r\nchallenge immediately came from Glasgow, supported by a boat named\r\n_Thistle_, built under the new rule; and to oppose it Mr. Burgess\r\nbuilt the _Volunteer_, which differed from its predecessors mainly in\r\nincreased draft and tendency toward the cutter model. She easily beat\r\nthe _Thistle_, and the discouraged foreigners rested for some years\r\nbefore trying again to wrest from us the coveted trophy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “PURITAN.”]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FROM PHOTOGRAPHS BY J. S. JOHNSTON AND PURVIANCE.\r\n\r\n“MAYFLOWER.”]\r\n\r\nIn 1891, however, there came to New York, from the yards of the\r\nHerreshoff Brothers, in Rhode Island, a new forty-six-foot yacht, which\r\nsoon put the fame of the _Volunteer_ and all her glorious rivals into\r\nthe background. This was the _Gloriana_, “remarkable as a daring and\r\noriginal departure from the accepted theories.” The radical novelty in\r\nher form consisted in the great cutting away of her bulk under water\r\nwhile preserving the full extent of the water-line, and the making of\r\na very deep, heavily loaded keel, trusted for stability. Her hull was\r\nalso novel, consisting of a double skin of thin wood on steel frames,\r\nwhile the upper part of the hull projected excessively at both ends.\r\nShe was everywhere a winner, and was immediately followed by a smaller\r\nboat, the _Dilemma_, whose keel was an almost rectangular plate of\r\nsteel, the ballast, which alone was trusted for stability, being in the\r\nform of a cigar-shaped cylinder of lead bolted to the lower edge of the\r\n“fin,” as this kind of keel was appropriately styled. Many boats of\r\nthis pattern were soon afloat, most of them highly successful at home\r\nand abroad, and carrying a surprising spread of canvas.\r\n\r\nThe year 1893 brought another challenge for the cup in the person\r\nof Lord Dunraven, sailing the yacht _Valkyrie_, but he was met by a\r\nnew, well-proved Herreshoff fin-keel, the _Vigilant_ (built of a new\r\nalloy—Tobin bronze), and handsomely defeated. The following season the\r\n_Vigilant_ went to England, and found herself equally overmatched by\r\nthe _Britannia_, owned by the Prince of Wales, while _Valkyrie II_ was\r\nwrecked. In 1895 Lord Dunraven sent a second challenge, backed by a new\r\n_Valkyrie (III)_; and this produced a fresh American contestant, again\r\ndesigned and built by the Herreshoffs, named _Defender_. The races came\r\noff amid intense public excitement, outside of Sandy Hook, but were\r\nmost unsatisfactory; “in the first, _Defender_ won; in the second,\r\n_Valkyrie_ was disqualified as the result of a foul, and Lord Dunraven\r\ndeclined to sail a third.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPARISON OF OLD AND NEW TYPES.\r\n\r\n  1. “America,” 1851, water-line 90 feet.—2. “Cambria,” 1868,\r\n  water-line 100 feet.—3. “Magic,” 1857-69, water-line 79 feet.—4.\r\n  “Sappho,” 1867, water-line 120 feet.—5. “Mischief,” 1879, water-line\r\n  61 feet.—6. “Puritan,” 1885, water-line 81 feet.—7. “Genesta,” 1884,\r\n  water-line 81 feet.—8. “Thistle,” 1887, water-line 86 feet.—9.\r\n  “Volunteer,” 1887, water-line 85 feet.—10. “Gloriana,” 1891,\r\n  water-line 45 feet.—11. “Wasp,” 1892, water-line 46 feet.—12. “El\r\n  Chico,” 1892, water-line 25 feet.]\r\n\r\nSuch has been the history of this long series of races for the America\r\nCup, and such the development of its defenders; but while they and\r\ntheir work have stimulated interest in yachting all over the world,\r\nthey have really not influenced it greatly, because all of the later\r\nboats competing were not practical yachts, in which one might cruise\r\nand live afloat, and enjoy life with his friends, but “machines” in\r\nwhich every quality tending to comfort and safety was sacrificed to\r\nthe requirements of speed. In fact, the owners of these “big boats”\r\nkept small, handy, comfortable yachts for their own enjoyment, and the\r\nracers were as a rule sailed by a skipper and crew of professional\r\nracing sailors.\r\n\r\nThere are said to be over two hundred yacht-clubs in the United States,\r\nenrolling about four thousand yachts, an eighth of which are steam or\r\nelectric boats, scattered wherever any water suitable for the sport\r\nexists. With the lakes and rivers we have nothing to do, except to\r\nsay that the yachtsmen of Montreal and Quebec are really salt-water\r\nsailors, for they cruise in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and elsewhere at\r\nsea as well as their fellow-sportsmen of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.\r\nAt the other extreme the Havana Yacht-Club has American members who\r\ntake their boats to the West Indies every winter. Bermuda is another\r\nfavorite resort, and the scene of lively races with a local, narrow\r\nsort of craft, called a “flyer,” which will beat almost anything if\r\nonly it can be kept right side up.\r\n\r\n  On the Pacific coast, ... wherever there is a bay that will afford\r\n  a harbor, and a town that will support people, the yacht is used as\r\n  a vehicle of pleasure.... Many of the San Francisco boats are large\r\n  schooners, a number are powerful sea-going sloops, while of smaller\r\n  craft there is an abundance of almost every type, although the New\r\n  York catboat and the flat-bottomed sharpie of Long Island Sound are\r\n  seldom met with, and seem not to be in favor.... Pacific yachters\r\n  appreciate the good points of the yawl, for the squalls which blow\r\n  over the waters of the west coast are sudden and severe, and no rig\r\n  meets these conditions of weather so well as does the yawl.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DRAWN BY W. TABER       FROM A PHOTOGRAPH BY WALTER BLACKBURN.\r\n\r\nTHE NEWPORT CATBOAT.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important and numerous yachting interest of the country,\r\nhowever, as would be expected, is along the northeastern seaboard,\r\nwhere, measured by numbers and the investment in boats, wharves,\r\nclub-houses, and equipments generally, it surpasses any other district\r\nin the world. More than one hundred clubs exist between Maine and\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\n  The earliest form of yacht [as Mr. F. W. Pangborn reminds us in “The\r\n  Century” for May, 1892] was, of course, a rowboat with a sail....\r\n  From the primitive sprit-sail pleasure-boat comes the ever-present\r\n  and universally favored center-board catboat, a type of yacht which,\r\n  for speed, handiness, and unsafeness, has never been surpassed.\r\n  Keel catboats are also built, but the typical American “cat” is\r\n  the center-board boat of light draft, big beam, and huge sail.\r\n  The two objectionable points about boats of this class are their\r\n  capsizability, and their bad habit of yawing when sailing before\r\n  the wind. Yet the cat is the handiest light-weather boat made. It\r\n  is very fast, quick in stays, and simple in rig; but it can never\r\n  become a first-class seaworthy type of yacht. It belongs among the\r\n  fair-weather pleasure-boats....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RIG OF THE YAWL.]\r\n\r\n  From the center-board catboat grew the jib-and-mainsail sloop, a type\r\n  of yacht which has always been noted for its great speed and general\r\n  unhandiness. Small yachts of this kind are always racers, and the\r\n  interest in racing is sufficient to keep them in the lists of popular\r\n  boats. In design they are like the catboats, the only difference\r\n  being in their rig. These two boats, the center-board cat and the\r\n  jib-and-mainsail sloop, are what yachters call “sandbaggers”; that is\r\n  to say, their ballast consists of bags of sand which are shifted to\r\n  windward with every tack and thus serve to keep the yachts right side\r\n  up. A boat ballasted in this manner can carry more sail than rightly\r\n  belongs on her sticks, but she cannot be very safe or comfortable.\r\n  Her place is in the regatta. It is not beyond the truth to assert\r\n  that the sandbaggers constitute probably two fifths of the total of\r\n  small yachts. They will never cease to be popular, for the reason\r\n  that speed and sport are synonymous terms with a great many yachters,\r\n  and no one can deny that these boats, like Brother Jasper’s sun, “do\r\n  move.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DRAWN BY W. TABER, FROM A PHOTOGRAPH BY WALTER BLACKBURN.\r\n  ENGRAVED BY A. NEGRI.\r\n\r\nA SANDBAGGER SLOOP.]\r\n\r\n  Passing the sandbaggers, the next popular and most universally used\r\n  yacht is the ballasted sloop. A sloop may be a center-board boat,\r\n  or a keel boat, or a combination of both. She has only one mast and\r\n  carries a topmast. Her sails are many, and, like the cutter, she is\r\n  permitted to carry clouds of canvas in a race. Technically speaking,\r\n  a cutter differs from a sloop only in one point, as the terms “sloop”\r\n  and “cutter” really apply to the rig of the yacht. The cutter has a\r\n  sail set from her stem to her masthead; the sloop has not. This sail\r\n  is called a forestay-sail, and its presence marks the cutter-rig.\r\n  The term “cutter,” however, is usually applied to the long, narrow,\r\n  deep-keeled vessel, and has in common parlance grown to mean a boat\r\n  of that type. It is in that sense that it is generally understood.\r\n  It is worthy of notice that nearly all yachters who cruise about in\r\n  summer, and especially those who are fond of speedy boats, use either\r\n  sloops or cutters; and it is remarkable to see how much comfort can\r\n  be found in boats of these types, even when quite small....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SHARPIE.]\r\n\r\n  The average yachting man, if he be of that stuff of which good seamen\r\n  are made, soon finds his chief delight in being master of his own\r\n  vessel. He likes to feel that it is his skill, his prowess, his\r\n  intellect, that rule the ship in which he sails; and finding this\r\n  complete mastery of the vessel to be impossible aboard a big boat,\r\n  he longs for one which he can handle alone. This independent and\r\n  sportsmanlike instinct of the American yachter has culminated in a\r\n  liking for certain classes of very small boats,—“single-handers” they\r\n  are called,—and this liking has given impetus to the building of some\r\n  little vessels which are really marvels in their way. Simplicity\r\n  and handiness of rig have been considered in their construction,\r\n  and this has led in many cases to the adoption of what is known as\r\n  the yawl style, a rig which for safety and convenience has never\r\n  been surpassed by any other. The yawl is really a schooner with very\r\n  small mainsail. For small cruising-yachts it is an excellent rig,\r\n  and preferable to the cat rig. Cat-yawls are also in use; they are\r\n  merely yawls without jibs. With such rigs as these a yachter can go\r\n  alone upon the water without fear of trouble and with no need of\r\n  assistance. Naturally, with men of moderate means who love the water,\r\n  these small single-handers have become very popular. Some of them are\r\n  not over sixteen feet long, yet the solitary skipper-crew-and-cook,\r\n  all in one, of such a boat finds in his yacht comfortable\r\n  sleeping-quarters, cook-stove, dinner-table, and all necessary\r\n  “fixings.” The ingenuity displayed in fitting out the cabins of these\r\n  little boats is quite remarkable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BUCKEYE.]\r\n\r\n  Of the many nondescript rigs which are applied to small yachts,\r\n  two are in common use. One of these is the sharpie, a simple\r\n  leg-o’-mutton rig used with flat-bottomed boats. Large sharpies\r\n  have been built with fine cabin accommodations, and such boats are\r\n  particularly adapted to the shoal waters of the South. They are fast\r\n  sailers, but owing to their long, narrow bodies and light draft, are\r\n  not always trustworthy. They are cheaper to build than boats of other\r\n  designs....\r\n\r\n  Buckeyes are favored only in the South. Originally the buckeye was\r\n  a log hollowed out and shaped into a boat, and was used by the\r\n  negroes. To-day, however, buckeyes are built upon carefully drawn\r\n  plans, and many of them are excellent vessels. They are common on\r\n  the coast waters south of the Delaware Bay, and are used chiefly for\r\n  hunting-boats, their cheapness, handiness, and roominess rendering\r\n  them useful to the sportsman. A true buckeye is a double-ender,\r\n  but some large ones have been built with an overhang stern, which\r\n  destroys the ideal and creates a new kind of craft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD-STYLE PIROGUE WITH LEEBOARD.]\r\n\r\n  A few years ago the sailing public was surprised by the appearance\r\n  upon the waters of a spider-like contrivance which its friends said\r\n  was a “catamaran.” This new claimant for yachting favor was like\r\n  the raft of the South Sea Islanders only in name; in fact, it was\r\n  not a catamaran at all, but a new device for racing over the water\r\n  by means of sails. Wonderful feats were predicted for the future of\r\n  the catamaran, and it certainly did accomplish something; but after\r\n  a long and fair trial (for the yachter, no matter how bigoted he\r\n  may be, will always try a new boat) it was discarded as a useless,\r\n  dangerous, and decidedly unsatisfactory kind of craft....\r\n\r\n  Leaving the discussion of the odds and ends of yacht styles, we\r\n  come, by natural progress, to a type which is destined to greater\r\n  popularity as time goes on, and yachters learn the ways of the sea\r\n  and the best methods of dealing with them. Although the schooner\r\n  is generally deemed a big yacht, it is nevertheless a fact that\r\n  small schooners are desirable boats to have, and that the number of\r\n  schooners of small tonnage is increasing. There is no denying the\r\n  advantage of the schooner’s rig over that of the sloop. A schooner\r\n  of forty feet is handier, safer, and less expensive to run than a\r\n  forty-foot sloop. The rig of the schooner is peculiarly adapted\r\n  to all weathers, and a small crew can handle such a vessel with\r\n  ease, when to manage a sloop of equal size would require the best\r\n  efforts of “all hands and the cook.” The reason for this is that the\r\n  schooner’s sails can be attended to one at a time, which is not the\r\n  case with the big-mainsail sloop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FROM A PHOTOGRAPH BY WALTER BLACKBURN.\r\n\r\nYACHTS WAITING FOR A BREEZE.]\r\n\r\n  It is the small yachter [Mr. Pangborn declares in conclusion] who\r\n  gives to the sport its wide popularity, and makes yachting so\r\n  universally loved by men who are fond of aquatic pleasuring. The\r\n  small yachter is everywhere upon the waters. From the coast of Maine,\r\n  from the shores of the harbor of the Golden Gate, from the beaches\r\n  of the Atlantic seaboard, and from the borders of the inland lakes,\r\n  he can be seen, all summer long, sailing about in his little vessel,\r\n  and enjoying in all its fullness the excitement and delight of this\r\n  most noble and health-giving sport. With a pluck and energy that\r\n  mark the true lover of the sea, and a tact and skill that bespeak\r\n  the real sailor, he handles his little craft, in fair weather and in\r\n  foul, in a manner that leaves no room for doubt as to its fitness for\r\n  the work which he is doing; for, whether he sail alone, or with the\r\n  help of his friends, or that of a hired man to run his boat, he is\r\n  always the master of his vessel,—which is seldom the case with the\r\n  proprietor of the big boat,—and is in reality a “yachtsman” under\r\n  all circumstances, at all times, and in all weathers. He must be\r\n  cool-headed and calm in times of peril, affable and courteous on all\r\n  social occasions, and generous and prompt to respond to all calls\r\n  upon his courage—in brief, a gentleman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “ADLER” PLUNGING TOWARD THE REEF AT SAMOA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nDANGERS OF THE DEEP\r\n\r\n\r\nNeither ships of the stanchest steel, nor seamen however skilful, nor\r\npilots never so knowing, can wholly avoid the dangers of a seafaring\r\nlife. Experience in reading the signs of the ocean and of the skies,\r\nsurveyors’ charts of coasts and harbors, added to the appliances of\r\npowerful modern machinery, have lessened the perils, it is true, since\r\nthe old times; yet even now ships sail proudly out of sunny havens,\r\ntheir topsails watched by loving eyes till they disappear at sunset,\r\nand are never seen again. On a calm day in 1782 the great hundred-gun\r\nline-of-battle-ship _Royal George_ sank at her anchors in the harbor\r\nof Spithead, carrying down almost a thousand souls; thirty years ago\r\nthe _Captain_, then one of the finest of England’s steam turret-ships,\r\ncapsized at sea, and not a man survived. Each of these vessels was\r\nperhaps the best of its kind in the world. No better navigators exist\r\nthan naval officers, yet they ran the historic old steam-frigate\r\n_Kearsarge_ on Roncador Reef, in the Caribbean Sea, in broad daylight,\r\nand left her there a total wreck. Not a year passes that does not\r\nrecord some dire calamity on the ocean, and many lesser accidents.\r\n\r\nThe wild oceanic storms are responsible for fewer of these than\r\nanything else—I mean the mere power of wind and waves in the open\r\nsea. When a captain has sea-room, and knows in advance, as he almost\r\nalways may, of the coming of a storm, so that he can make everything\r\nsnug, the loss of his vessel, or even serious damage to her, is not\r\ncommon. Yet the mere violence of the gale has overturned, beaten down,\r\nand extinguished the greater part of the Newfoundland fishing-fleet\r\nagain and again, and doubtless many of the ships that are recorded as\r\n“missing” have been sunk simply by overwhelming waves.\r\n\r\nCertain rare and extraordinary mishaps nevertheless may meet a vessel\r\nin the open ocean. One of these is a stroke of lightning, powerful\r\nenough to set a ship on fire in spite of her lightning-rods, and such a\r\nfire is likely never to be quenched. Another extraordinary occurrence\r\nwould be an overwhelming waterspout, such as not infrequently is seen\r\nin the tropics, especially along the Chinese coast, where it often\r\nplays havoc with fishing junks. A third unusual, yet possible, peril\r\nis the meeting with those waves of sudden and extraordinary size and\r\nvolume which sometimes engulf vessels in storms that otherwise might\r\nbe safely weathered, or are surmounted only by a miracle, as it were.\r\nThese are said to be produced in some cyclones, as one of the effects\r\nof that whirling form of storm, and are often called tidal waves, but\r\nthe tide has nothing to do with their formation or progress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE U. S. S. “ONEIDA” AFTER COLLISION WITH A STEAMSHIP.]\r\n\r\nTo say that a ship in mid-ocean might be destroyed by an earthquake\r\nseems paradoxical and absurd, yet it is true. Whenever a subterranean\r\nconvulsion occurs beneath or at the edge of the sea, the water will be\r\nagitated in proportion to its force. Strike a tub of water a gentle\r\ntap and see how its liquid contents shiver and ripple. Watch a railway\r\ntrain running at the edge of a body of water, and observe how the water\r\ntrembles under the percussion of the wheels upon the ground.\r\n\r\nEarthquake shocks give rise sometimes to great disturbances, either by\r\na direct jar to the water, or by setting in motion waves whose rolling\r\ndoes damage, especially in confined harbors. Sometimes a port will be\r\nsuddenly invaded by a wave, the cause of which was an earthquake, which\r\nrolls in upreared like a wall, and carries death and destruction in its\r\ncourse. The principal port of the island of St. Thomas, in the West\r\nIndies, was once devastated by this means. The incoming wave is said\r\nto have been over forty feet high, and broke inland, destroying much\r\nproperty and causing many deaths. “So tremendous was this breaker that\r\nit landed a large vessel on a hillside half a mile from the harbor.”\r\n\r\nSuch catastrophes are not uncommon in volcanic districts, where the\r\nocean retorts with terrible vengeance when it is struck by the land.\r\nThat appalling explosion in 1883 of Krakatoa, in the Strait of Sunda,\r\nwas followed on neighboring coasts by a series of vast billows that\r\nrolled inland, deluging a wide extent of shore, sweeping away over 150\r\nvillages, and crushing or drowning more than 30,000 persons. Within a\r\nfew years the coasts of northern Japan have been inundated repeatedly\r\nby earthquake waves with similar dire calamities, and they are likely\r\nto occur again. Now and then earthquakes are felt even in the open sea,\r\nfar from land. Thus, Captain Lecky, a scientific writer upon the sea,\r\ntells us that in one instance where he was present, the inkstand upon\r\nthe captain’s table was jerked upward against the ceiling, where it\r\nleft an unmistakable record of the occurrence; and yet this vessel was\r\nsteaming along in smooth water, many hundreds of fathoms deep. “The\r\nconcussions,” he says, “were so smart that passengers were shaken off\r\ntheir seats, and, of course, thought that the vessel had run ashore.”\r\nAll this disturbance was, nevertheless, only the result of a shock at\r\nthe bottom; and when the non-elastic nature of water is considered, the\r\nseverity of the jar is not surprising.\r\n\r\nIt would seem as though in the vast breadth of the “world of waters,”\r\nand with nothing to obstruct the view, two ships might easily give\r\none another a wide berth; yet a collision is one of the ever-present\r\ndangers of voyaging, even far from land. It is to avoid this peril that\r\nall the maritime nations have agreed upon certain signals, and “rules\r\nof the road” which are the same in all parts of the world, and without\r\nwhich it would now be almost impossible to carry on commerce or travel\r\non the water.\r\n\r\nThe rules of the road say that when two vessels are approaching one\r\nanother, head on, each shall turn off to the right far enough to avoid\r\nthe other; that when two vessels are crossing one another’s courses,\r\nthe one which has the other on her starboard (right hand) must turn to\r\nstarboard (the right), and go behind the other vessel, while the latter\r\ncontinues along her course; and that a steam vessel must always get out\r\nof the way of a sailing vessel, one at anchor or disabled, or a vessel\r\nwith another in tow.\r\n\r\nIt is presumed that every ship will keep a sharp lookout, and that in\r\nthe daytime two approaching ships will see each other in time to keep\r\nsafely apart; but in the darkness of night none could be safe unless\r\nall carried lights by which the position and character of each could be\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times this matter of lights at sea was a much more\r\ntroublesome one than now. We know that the Roman navy managed it\r\nsomehow, and had methods of signaling by lanterns and torches. In\r\nmedieval and early times, say up to a couple of centuries ago, a ship’s\r\nlights were a much more conspicuous and bothersome part of her than\r\nnow, when, indeed, electricity has simplified as well as perfected\r\nsignaling as much as it has benefited general illumination on ship’s\r\nboard. In such ships as those of the Armada, and long afterward, three\r\nhuge lanterns made of ornamental iron-work, sometimes large enough\r\nto enable a man to move about inside them, surmounted the elevated\r\nafter-quarter; and these were filled with dozens of great candles.\r\nHow important candles were in the stores of one of these old ships is\r\nshown by the fact that we still call a merchant who outfits vessels a\r\n_ship-chandler_. Regular rules were formulated for judging of a ship’s\r\nposition and movements, and how you ought to steer by the way these\r\nbeacons grouped themselves. The introduction of whale oil gradually\r\nsuperseded candles and as the sperm-lamp did not require a glass house,\r\nsmaller lanterns took the place of the big ones, until finally, by\r\naid of lenses, reflectors, and kerosene, and still more lately by the\r\nuse of electricity, ship’s lights have become the small, handy, and\r\npowerful ones they are to-day.\r\n\r\nThe present rules as to lights are these—using the language of a United\r\nStates navy officer, Lieut. John M. Ellicott, who has written many\r\ninstructive and entertaining essays on sea-affairs:\r\n\r\n  When you face toward a ship’s bow the side at your right hand is\r\n  called the starboard side, and the side at your left hand is called\r\n  the port side. On her starboard side a ship carries at night a green\r\n  light, and it is so shut in by the two sides of a box that it cannot\r\n  be seen from the port side or from behind. On her port side she\r\n  carries a red light, and it is so shut in that it cannot be seen\r\n  from the starboard side or from behind. If the ship is a steamship\r\n  she carries a big white light at her foremast-head, but if she is a\r\n  sailing vessel she does not. This white masthead light can be seen\r\n  from all around except from behind....\r\n\r\n  It is for the red and green lights, commonly known as the side\r\n  lights, that the officer of the deck most intently watches (when the\r\n  lookout warns him that lights are in sight), for by them he can tell\r\n  which way the vessel is going. If her red light shows, he knows that\r\n  her port side is toward him and she is crossing to his left; if it is\r\n  her green light, her starboard side is toward him and she is crossing\r\n  to his right; but if both the red and green are showing, she is\r\n  heading straight in his direction.... If a vessel has another vessel\r\n  in tow, she carries two masthead lights instead of one; and when a\r\n  vessel is at anchor she has no side lights or masthead light, but a\r\n  single white light made fast to a stay where it can be seen from all\r\n  around her.\r\n\r\n  In rivers and crowded harbors it is often impossible to follow the\r\n  rules of the road; and sometimes even at sea the officer of the deck\r\n  of one vessel discovers that the other is not heeding the rules. Then\r\n  the steam-whistle is used to tell the other vessel what the first\r\n  is doing. Thus, one whistle means “I am going to the right”; two\r\n  whistles mean “I am going to the left”; and three whistles mean “I am\r\n  backing”; while a series of short toots means “Look out for yourself;\r\n  get out of the way!”\r\n\r\n  There is one class of vessels which is most annoying to those who\r\n  direct the course of large steamers. These are small fishing-vessels.\r\n  On the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, on the coast of Spain, and on\r\n  the coasts of China and Japan big fleets of these little vessels\r\n  are found at all times. They show no lights at night, preferring to\r\n  save the expense of oil, and take their chances of being sent to the\r\n  bottom; but when they see a big ship rushing down upon them, they\r\n  light a torch and flare it about. Often they pay for their folly with\r\n  their lives. The torch is seen too late, or not seen at all, and the\r\n  great iron bow of the steamship crushes into the frail little craft,\r\n  perhaps cutting her clean in two; and the unhappy fishermen sink into\r\n  the foaming wake of the churning propellers, leaving not a soul to\r\n  tell their wives what became of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELECTRIC-LIGHT SIGNALS AT SEA: ARDOIS SYSTEM.]\r\n\r\nSignaling with lights is principally of use to men-of-war, where, also,\r\nlanterns hung in the rigging in a particular order have a definite\r\nsignificance. For long-distance signaling the best system is that\r\ninvented by Lieutenant Very, U. S. N. These night-signals “consist of a\r\nwhite, a red, and a green star, each fired into the air from a pistol,\r\nso that by firing one, two, or three of them in quick succession and in\r\ndifferent orders, with a pause between the groups, different letters or\r\nsignal numbers can be made until a sentence is complete.” They can be\r\neasily read from vessels twelve miles away. For nearer work the system\r\nof the Spanish navy officer, Ardois, which consists in flashing and\r\nextinguishing, by means of a switchboard on deck, a series of red and\r\nwhite electric lamps in the rigging, serves very well; and close at\r\nhand a signal-man waves an incandescent electric bulb by night as he\r\nwould a flag by day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “VERY” ROCKET-SIGNAL AT SEA.]\r\n\r\nIt is, however, when the land is approached that the sailor’s perils\r\nbecome menacing. Here Old Neptune is still a match for us when he\r\nasserts himself. Nevertheless, we must go upon the restless waters,\r\nand must risk a contest with their power along the coasts, where the\r\nocean’s _line of battle_ may be said to be. Therefore, every effort\r\nhas always been made by men on land to be of aid to their brethren at\r\nsea by erecting beacons to guide them by night as well as by day, by\r\nmarking the channels, so that hidden shoals, rocks, and obstructions\r\nmay be avoided, and by contrivances to save life and property when the\r\nfury of the gale renders seamanship futile, and the noble ship is cast\r\naway in the surf thundering on some wild shore, to break up in a few\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nWhat could be more humiliating to our pride, as well as terrifying to\r\nour hearts, than such a scene as that at Samoa, in 1889, when a whole\r\nfleet of ships, including powerful men-of-war, was wrecked while at\r\nanchor in the beautiful harbor of Apia. Of small use, then, were all\r\ntheir charts and lighthouses, buoys and breakwaters!\r\n\r\nThe disturbed state of affairs in Samoa caused the assemblage there,\r\nduring March, 1889, of three small German men-of-war, _Adler_,\r\n_Olga_, and _Eber_, the British corvette _Calliope_, and the American\r\nsteamships _Trenton_, _Vandalia_ and _Nipsic_. The _Trenton_,\r\nCaptain Farquhar, was one of our largest war-ships at that time,\r\nand the flagship of Rear-Admiral Kimberley; the _Vandalia_, Captain\r\nSchoonmaker, was somewhat smaller, and the _Nipsic_, Commander Mullan,\r\nwas still less in size. On March 15 a hurricane demolished the whole of\r\nthis fleet, except one, and ten merchant vessels besides, and caused\r\nthe loss of nearly one hundred and fifty lives. It is an extraordinary\r\nstory, which has been fully related by Mr. John P. Dunning, from whose\r\narticle in “St. Nicholas” for February, 1890, the accompanying facts\r\nand illustrations are drawn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “CALLIOPE” ESCAPING FROM APIA HARBOR.]\r\n\r\n  The harbor in which the disaster occurred is a small semicircular\r\n  bay, around the inner side of which lies the town of Apia. A coral\r\n  reef, visible at low water, extends in front of the harbor from the\r\n  eastern to the western extremity, a distance of nearly two miles.\r\n  A break in this reef, probably a quarter of a mile wide, forms a\r\n  gateway to the harbor. The space within the bay where ships can lie\r\n  at anchor is very small, as a shoal extends some distance out from\r\n  the eastern shore, and on the other side another coral reef runs well\r\n  out into the bay. The war-vessels were anchored in the deep water in\r\n  front of the American consulate. The _Eber_ and _Nipsic_ were nearest\r\n  the shore. There were ten or twelve sailing-vessels, principally\r\n  small schooners lying in the shallow water west of the men-of-war.\r\n  The storm was preceded by several weeks of bad weather, and on\r\n  Friday, March 15, the wind increased and there was every indication\r\n  of a hard blow. The war-ships made preparation for it by lowering\r\n  topmasts and making all the spars secure, and steam was also raised\r\n  to guard against the possibility of the anchors not holding.\r\n\r\n  The wind rose to a hurricane and was accompanied by heavy,\r\n  wind-driven rain, and when toward morning it became evident that\r\n  some smaller ships were already ashore, and that the war-ships were\r\n  dragging their anchors in spite of every effort, the whole town was\r\n  awake, and much of it down by the beach seeking what shelter it could\r\n  from the sleet-like blast. This night of horror gradually lightened\r\n  into dawn, when it was seen that all the war-ships had been swept\r\n  from their former moorings and were bearing down toward the inner\r\n  reef. The decks swarmed with men clinging to anything affording a\r\n  hold. The hulls of the ships were tossing about like corks, and the\r\n  decks were being deluged with water as every wave swept in from the\r\n  open ocean. Several sailing-vessels had gone ashore in the western\r\n  part of the bay. Those most plainly visible now were the _Eber_,\r\n  _Adler_, and _Nipsic_, very close together and only a few yards from\r\n  the reef.\r\n\r\n  The little gunboat _Eber_ was making a desperate struggle, but her\r\n  doom was certain. Suddenly she shot forward, the current bore her off\r\n  to the right, and her bow struck the port quarter of the _Nipsic_,\r\n  carrying away several feet of the _Nipsic’s_ rail and one boat. The\r\n  _Eber_ then fell back and fouled with the _Olga_, and after that she\r\n  swung around broadside to the wind, was lifted high on the crest of a\r\n  great wave and hurled with awful force upon the reef. In an instant\r\n  there was not a vestige of her to be seen. Every timber must have\r\n  been shattered, and half the poor creatures aboard of her crushed to\r\n  death before they felt the waters closing above their heads. Hundreds\r\n  of people were on the beach by this time, and the work of destruction\r\n  had occurred within full view of them all. They stood for a moment\r\n  appalled by the awful scene, and a cry of horror arose from the lips\r\n  of every man who had seen nearly a hundred of his fellow-creatures\r\n  perish in an instant. Then with one accord they all rushed to the\r\n  water’s edge nearest the point where the _Eber_ had foundered. The\r\n  natives ran into the surf far beyond the point where a white man\r\n  could have lived, and stood waiting to save any who might rise from\r\n  the water. There were six officers and seventy men on the _Eber_ when\r\n  she struck the reef, and of these five officers and sixty-six men\r\n  were lost. This was about six o’clock in the morning.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: “THE SAMOANS STOOD BATTLING AGAINST THE SURF, RISKING\r\n  THEIR LIVES TO SAVE THE AMERICAN SAILORS.”]\r\n\r\n  During the excitement attending that calamity the other vessels\r\n  had been for the time forgotten, but it was soon noticed that the\r\n  positions of several of them had become more alarming. The _Adler_\r\n  had been swept across the bay, close to the reef, and in half an hour\r\n  she was lifted on top of the reef and turned completely over on her\r\n  side. Nearly every man was thrown into the water, but as almost the\r\n  entire hull was exposed, all but twenty succeeded in regaining her\r\n  deck, and the remainder were rescued toward the close of the day when\r\n  almost exhausted.\r\n\r\n  Just after the _Adler_ struck, the attention of every one was\r\n  directed toward the _Nipsic_. She was standing off the reef with her\r\n  head to the wind, but the three anchors which she had out at the time\r\n  were not holding; and orders were given to attach a hawser to a heavy\r\n  eight-inch rifle on the forecastle and throw the gun overboard. As\r\n  the men were in the act of doing this, the _Olga_ bore down on the\r\n  _Nipsic_ and struck her amidships with awful force. Her bowsprit\r\n  passed over the side of the _Nipsic_, and, after carrying away one\r\n  boat and splintering the rail, came in contact with the smokestack,\r\n  which was struck fairly in the center and fell to the deck with a\r\n  crash like thunder. For a moment it was difficult to realize what had\r\n  happened, and great confusion followed. The iron smokestack rolled\r\n  from side to side with every movement of the vessel, until finally\r\n  heavy blocks were placed under it. By that time the _Nipsic_ had\r\n  swung around and was approaching the reef, and it seemed certain that\r\n  she would go down in the same way as had the _Eber_. Captain Mullan\r\n  saw that any further attempt to save the vessel would be useless,\r\n  so he gave the orders to beach her. She had a straight course of\r\n  about two hundred yards to the sandy beach in front of the American\r\n  consulate, where she stuck and stood firm.\r\n\r\n  Two attempts to lower boats were failures and every man crowded to\r\n  the forecastle. A line was thrown, double hawsers were soon made fast\r\n  from the vessel to the shore, and the natives and others gathered\r\n  around the lines, where the voices of officers shouting to the men on\r\n  deck were mingled with the loud cries and singing of the Samoans. One\r\n  by one, and in a very orderly manner, the men of the _Nipsic_ came\r\n  down the hawsers toward the shore, but many would never have reached\r\n  it, had it not been for the assistance of the Samoans, who, at the\r\n  peril of their lives, stood in the boiling torrent, grasping those\r\n  whose hold was broken from the rope.\r\n\r\n  Meanwhile, the four large men-of-war, _Trenton_, _Calliope_,\r\n  _Vandalia_, and _Olga_, were still afloat and in a comparatively\r\n  safe position; but about ten o’clock the _Trenton_ was seen to be\r\n  in a helpless condition; her rudder and propeller were both gone,\r\n  and there was nothing but her anchors to hold her up against the\r\n  unabated force of the storm. The _Vandalia_ and _Calliope_ were also\r\n  in danger, drifting back toward the reef near the point where lay the\r\n  wreck of the _Adler_; and they came closer together every minute,\r\n  until finally the English ship struck the _Vandalia_ and tore a great\r\n  hole in her bow. Then Captain Kane of the _Calliope_ determined to\r\n  try to steam out of the harbor as his only hope, and he at once cut\r\n  loose from all his anchors. The _Calliope’s_ head swung around to the\r\n  wind and her engines were worked to their utmost power. Great waves\r\n  broke over her bow and she gained headway at first only inch by inch,\r\n  but her speed gradually increased until it became evident that she\r\n  could leave the harbor. This manœuver of the British ship is regarded\r\n  as one of the most daring in naval annals—the one desperate chance\r\n  offered her commander to save his vessel and the three hundred lives\r\n  aboard.\r\n\r\n  The _Trenton’s_ fires had gone out by that time, and she lay helpless\r\n  almost in the path of the _Calliope_. The decks were swarming with\r\n  men, but, facing death as they were, they recognized the heroic\r\n  struggle of the British ship, and a great shout went up from aboard\r\n  the _Trenton_. “Three cheers for the _Calliope_!” was the sound that\r\n  reached the ears of the British tars as they passed out of the harbor\r\n  in the teeth of the storm; and the heart of every Englishman went out\r\n  to the brave American sailors who gave that parting tribute to the\r\n  Queen’s ship.\r\n\r\n  When the excitement on the _Vandalia_ which followed the collision\r\n  with the _Calliope_ had subsided, it was determined to beach the\r\n  vessel, and straining every means at hand to avoid the dreaded reef,\r\n  she moved slowly across the harbor until her bow stuck in the sand,\r\n  about two hundred yards off shore and probably eighty yards from the\r\n  stem of the _Nipsic_. Her engines were stopped and the men in the\r\n  engine-room and fire-room below were ordered on deck. The ship swung\r\n  around broadside to the shore, and it was thought at first that her\r\n  position was comparatively safe, as it was believed that the storm\r\n  would abate in a few hours, and the two hundred and forty men on\r\n  board could be rescued then; but the wind seemed to increase in fury,\r\n  and as the hull of the steamer sank lower the force of the waves grew\r\n  more violent, yet no one on shore was able to render the least aid.\r\n\r\n  These terrible scenes had detracted attention from the other two\r\n  men-of-war still afloat; but about four o’clock in the afternoon\r\n  the positions of the _Trenton_ and _Olga_ became most alarming. The\r\n  flagship had been in a helpless condition for hours, being without\r\n  rudder or propeller, while volumes of water poured in through her\r\n  hawser-pipes. Men never fought against adverse circumstances with\r\n  more desperation than the officers and men of the _Trenton_ displayed\r\n  during those hours, yet the vessel was slowly forced over toward\r\n  the eastern reef. Destruction seemed imminent, as the great vessel\r\n  was pitching heavily, and her stern was but a few feet from the\r\n  reef. This point was a quarter of a mile from shore, and if the\r\n  _Trenton_ had struck the reef there, it is probable that not a life\r\n  would have been saved. A skilful manœuver, suggested by Lieutenant\r\n  Brown, saved the ship from destruction. Every man was ordered into\r\n  the port rigging, and the compact mass of bodies was used as a sail.\r\n  The wind struck against the men in the rigging and forced the vessel\r\n  out into the bay again. She soon commenced to drift back against the\r\n  _Olga_, which was still standing off the reef and holding up against\r\n  the storm more successfully than any other vessel in the harbor\r\n  had done, and in spite of every effort on the part of both ships a\r\n  collision took place which severely damaged both. Fortunately, the\r\n  vessels drifted apart, whereupon the _Olga_ steamed ahead toward the\r\n  mud-flats in the eastern part of the bay, and was soon hard and fast\r\n  on the bottom. Not a life was lost, and several weeks later the ship\r\n  was hauled off and saved.\r\n\r\n  The _Trenton_ was now about two hundred feet from the sunken\r\n  _Vandalia_, and seemed sure to strike her and throw into the water\r\n  the men still clinging to the rigging. It was now after five o’clock,\r\n  and the daylight was beginning to fade away. In a half hour more, the\r\n  _Trenton_ had drifted to within a few yards of the _Vandalia’s_ bow,\r\n  and feelings hard to describe came to the hundreds who watched the\r\n  vessels from the shore.\r\n\r\n  Presently the last faint rays of daylight faded away, and night came\r\n  down upon the awful scene. The storm was still raging with as much\r\n  fury as at any time during the day. The poor creatures who had been\r\n  clinging for hours to the rigging of the _Vandalia_ were bruised\r\n  and bleeding; but they held on with the desperation of men who were\r\n  hanging between life and death. The ropes had cut the flesh on\r\n  their arms and legs, and their eyes were blinded by the salt spray\r\n  which swept over them. Weak and exhausted as they were, they would\r\n  be unable to stand the terrible strain much longer. The final hour\r\n  seemed to be upon them. The great, black hull of the _Trenton_ was\r\n  almost ready to crash into the stranded _Vandalia_ and grind her\r\n  to atoms. Suddenly a shout was borne across the waters. The sound\r\n  of four hundred and fifty voices was heard above the roar of the\r\n  tempest. “Three cheers for the _Vandalia_!” was the cry that warmed\r\n  the hearts of the dying men in the rigging.\r\n\r\n  The shout died away upon the storm, and there arose from the\r\n  quivering masts of the sunken ship a response so feeble it was\r\n  scarcely heard upon the shore. Every heart was melted to pity. “God\r\n  help them!” was passed from one man to another. The cheer had hardly\r\n  ceased when the sound of music came across the water. The _Trenton’s_\r\n  band was playing “The Star-Spangled Banner.” The thousand men on sea\r\n  and shore had never before heard strains of music at such a time as\r\n  that. An indescribable feeling came over the Americans on the beach\r\n  who listened to the notes of the national song mingled with the\r\n  howling of the storm.\r\n\r\n  But the collision of the _Trenton_ and _Vandalia_, instead of\r\n  crushing the latter vessel to pieces, proved to be the salvation of\r\n  the men in the rigging. When the _Trenton’s_ stern finally struck\r\n  the side of the _Vandalia_, there was no shock, and she swung around\r\n  broadside to the sunken ship. This enabled the men on the _Vandalia_\r\n  to escape to the deck of the _Trenton_, and in a short time they were\r\n  all taken off.\r\n\r\n  The storm had abated at midnight, and when day dawned there was no\r\n  further cause for alarm. The men were removed from the _Trenton_ and\r\n  provided with quarters on shore.\r\n\r\n  During the next few days the evidences of the great disaster could be\r\n  seen on every side. In the harbor were the wrecks of four men-of-war:\r\n  the _Trenton_, _Vandalia_, _Adler_, and _Eber_; and two others, the\r\n  _Nipsic_ and _Olga_, were hard and fast on the beach and were hauled\r\n  off with great difficulty. The wrecks of ten sailing-vessels also lay\r\n  upon the reefs. On shore, houses and trees were blown down, and the\r\n  beach was strewn with wreckage from one end of the town to the other.\r\n\r\nEver since men began to go to sea lights have been placed on shore to\r\nguide them to a landing-place; but in early times these were nothing\r\nmore than fires on headlands, kindled, perhaps, by the wives and\r\nchildren of the captain and his crew of neighbors, when these mariners\r\nwere expected home. These friendly services became a little more\r\nsystematic when merchants began to risk their property on the water;\r\nand on the shores of the Mediterranean, which we have found to be the\r\ncradle of civilized navigation and trade, harbor-beacons were erected\r\nin very early times as guides to a safe anchorage.\r\n\r\n  The giant statue known as the Colossus, at Rhodes, is supposed to\r\n  have been used as a beacon and lighthouse, a fire burning in the\r\n  palm of its uplifted colossal hand at night. Although the account of\r\n  the Colossus is only a matter of guesswork, it is historically true\r\n  that in those ages of ignorant heedlessness of the need of beacons,\r\n  a lighthouse was built so grand in proportions, so enduring in\r\n  character, that it became known as one of the Seven Wonders of the\r\n  World, and outlived all the others, save the Pyramids, by centuries,\r\n  and in some ways has never been excelled by any similar structure\r\n  in modern times, unless it be by our mammoth marble monument to\r\n  Washington. This was the lighthouse built on the little island of\r\n  Pharos by Ptolemy Philadelphus, king of Egypt, two hundred and eighty\r\n  years before Christ, to guide vessels into the harbor of Alexandria.\r\n  From all descriptions, it must have closely resembled our Washington\r\n  monument; for it was built of white stone, was square at the base,\r\n  and tapered toward the apex. Open windows were near its top, through\r\n  which the fire within could be seen for thirty miles by vessels at\r\n  sea.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of these beacons in the general smash and ruin that\r\nseem to have overtaken the world when the Roman empire went to pieces\r\nis only indicative of the way the darkness of barbarism returned and\r\nenveloped the minds as well as the works of men, until light broke\r\nthrough the clouds again with the rise of organized sea-powers in\r\nWestern Europe. Then beacons were gradually rebuilt, but in almost all\r\ncases by private hands—the feudal lords of coast estates, the master\r\nor authorities of sea-ports, the monks in monasteries near dangerous\r\nlandings, and now and then the king at his principal port, setting up\r\nmarks for steering by day and lighting fires on dark nights. Most of\r\nthe latter were hardly more than tar-barrels, which would burn brightly\r\nin a gale, and the better class were towers of stonework, on top of\r\nwhich a mass of coal was ignited in an iron cage, and kept stirred into\r\nbrightness by a watcher.\r\n\r\nIt was an easy matter to imitate such beacons, and wreckers would\r\noften set up false lights. Many a fearful tradition has come down of\r\nthe doings of wreckers, not only in England and Spain, but in America\r\nand in the East. One of their tricks, when they saw a ship approaching\r\nin the evening, was to hang a lantern upon a horse’s neck, and let\r\nhim graze, well-hobbled, along the beach. This would appear like the\r\nrocking of a lantern on a vessel at rest—what is called a riding or\r\nanchor light; and, deceived by this promise of a safe anchorage, the\r\nstranger would not discover that he had been cheated until his keel\r\nstruck a reef or sandbar, and the pirates had begun their villainous\r\nattack. It is said to have been a device of this kind which caused\r\nthe wreck in 1812, on the Carolina coast,—whose islands and lagoons\r\nare reputed to have been infested by such ruffians, there known as\r\n“bankers,”—of a vessel carrying the beautiful Theodosia Burr, daughter\r\nof Aaron Burr, and wife of Governor Alston of South Carolina. Her death\r\nat the hands of these men is illustrated on page 172.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Henry VIII of England, an association of mariners\r\ncalled, in short, the Guild of the Trinity was chartered and given\r\nvarious powers and privileges in connection with the newly instituted\r\nroyal navy and dockyards. It encouraged coast-lights, and in 1573 Queen\r\nElizabeth formally placed authority to erect and govern lighthouses and\r\ncoast beacons in the hands of this corporation, and there it remains\r\nto this day; for its headquarters, Trinity House, on Tower Hill, in\r\nLondon, are a recognized office of the British government, answering to\r\nour Lighthouse Board.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before it encouraged the founding of a permanent light\r\non Eddystone Shoals, a group of reefs near Plymouth, exceedingly\r\ndangerous because they lie precisely in the track of ships bound\r\nup or down the English Channel, yet almost invisible. Upon the\r\nmere standing-room afforded by the crest of this rock, Sir William\r\nWinstanley managed to erect, two hundred years ago, a tower of wood\r\nand iron trestle-work, bolted to its foundation and carrying a glass\r\nroom or lantern containing a coal-grate, eighty feet above low-water\r\nmark. This was completed in 1698. One winter’s experience convinced\r\nhim that it needed strengthening, and in 1699 a case of masonry was\r\nbuilt about the tower, and made solid to the height of twenty feet,\r\nwhile the whole structure was increased to the height of one hundred\r\nand twenty feet. Then, it is related, Winstanley boasted that the sea\r\nhad not strength enough to tear it down, and all England rejoiced in\r\nso noble a beacon; but we now know that the construction was faulty,\r\nin its large diameter, polygonal outline, excess of ornament, and\r\nlack of weight. While Sir William was within it making repairs, four\r\nyears later, the memorable hurricane of November 20, 1703, swept the\r\ncoast, and left scarcely a trace of the tower. Its value had been\r\nproved, however, and it was replaced, in 1706, by a straight-sided\r\ntower of oaken timbers, weighted in their lower courses by stone. This\r\nwas designed by an engineer named Rudyerd, and lasted until burned\r\ndown in 1755; and engineers say it was better for its place than was\r\nthe round, solid-based stone tower of Smeaton that followed it, and\r\nbecame so celebrated. This was finished in three years, and in 1760 was\r\nlighted, not by a fire, as of old, but by candles—the first use of such\r\nan illuminant. This truly illustrious lighthouse remained until a few\r\nyears ago, when it became so racked by the assaults of the sea as to\r\nbe unsafe. It was then replaced by the one that stands there to-day,\r\nrivaling its magnificent neighbor on the Biscay shore opposite, the\r\nlighthouse of Carduan, which was built to support a bonfire of oak, but\r\nhas remained to be lighted successively by oil-lamps, by gas-burners,\r\nand finally by electricity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ENGRAVED BY R. C. COLLINS.\r\n\r\nTHE WRECK OF THE FIRST MINOT’S LEDGE LIGHTHOUSE.]\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar history belongs to some of the lighthouses on this\r\nside of the Atlantic. The first one regularly set up in the United\r\nStates was that on the north side of the entrance to Boston harbor,\r\nerected in 1716; but many others go back to Colonial days—that on\r\nSandy Hook, for instance. Perhaps the most interesting history is\r\nattached to the light on Minot’s Ledge, in Boston harbor. This is a\r\ndangerous reef, concealed at high water and so exposed that the problem\r\nof lighting it was much the same as that presented at Eddystone, Bell\r\nRock, Dhu Heartach, and other well known islets on the British coast.\r\n\r\nThe first lighthouse on Minot’s Ledge was built in 1848, and was an\r\noctagonal tower resting on the tops of eight wrought-iron piles sixty\r\nfeet high, eight inches in diameter, and sunk five feet into the rock.\r\n\r\n  These piles were braced together in many ways, and, as they offered\r\n  less surface to the waves than a solid structure, the lighthouse was\r\n  considered by all authorities upon the subject to be exceptionally\r\n  strong. Its great test came in April, 1851. On the fourteenth of that\r\n  month, two keepers being in the lighthouse, an easterly gale set in,\r\n  steadily increasing in force.... On Wednesday, the sixteenth, the\r\n  gale had become a hurricane; and when at times the tower could be\r\n  seen through the mists and sea-drift, it seemed to bend to the shock\r\n  of the waves. At four o’clock that afternoon an ominous proof of the\r\n  fury of the waves on Minot’s Ledge reached the shore—a platform which\r\n  had been built between the piles only seven feet below the floor of\r\n  the keeper’s room. The raging seas, then, were leaping fifty feet in\r\n  the air. Would they reach ten feet higher?—for if so, the house and\r\n  the keepers were doomed. Nevertheless, when darkness set in the light\r\n  shone out as brilliantly as ever, but the gale seemed, if possible,\r\n  then to increase. What agony those two men must have suffered! How\r\n  that dreadful abode must have swayed in the irresistible hurricane,\r\n  and trembled at each crashing sea! The poor unfortunates must have\r\n  known that if those seas, leaping always higher and higher, ever\r\n  reached their house, it would be flung down into the ocean, and they\r\n  would be buried with it beneath the waves.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A SCREW-PILE OCEAN LIGHTHOUSE.]\r\n\r\n  To those hopeless, terrified watchers the entombing sea came at last.\r\n  At one o’clock in the morning the lighthouse bell was heard by those\r\n  on shore to give a mournful clang, and the light was extinguished. It\r\n  was the funeral knell of two patient heroes.\r\n\r\n  Next day there remained on the rock only eight jagged iron stumps.\r\n\r\nThus, everywhere, and in all latitudes, the beacons and wooden towers\r\nand huge pyramids of long ago have given place to slender spires of\r\nsolid masonry, holding powerful signals perhaps hundreds of feet above\r\nthe waves, and visible as far as the curve of the earth’s surface\r\nwill permit. Yet in place of the sturdy bonfire of oak, or the huge\r\niron cage full of coals, there is only a single lamp, whose rays are\r\ngathered by deep reflectors into a compact bundle of unwasted rays, and\r\ndoubled and redoubled by rows of magnifying lenses until they can dart\r\nto the furthest horizon in a strong beam of steady light. No longer\r\ndoes the mariner trust to his wife to kindle the tar-barrel to guide\r\nhim home. He knows that nowhere is his government more watchful of\r\nits subjects than in its lighthouse service, and that he may trust to\r\nhaving that bright signal to welcome him in the darkness, as well as he\r\ncan trust his own eyes to see it. The United States alone expends over\r\n$2,500,000 annually in looking after her lighthouses, lightships, and\r\nbuoys.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LIGHTHOUSE AT ST. AUGUSTINE, FLORIDA.]\r\n\r\nIndeed, these beacons have become so thickly planted that it has been\r\nfound necessary to distinguish between them in order to avoid mistaking\r\none for another. At first this was done by doubling, as in the case of\r\nNew York’s “Highland Lights,” or the twin lights of Thatcher’s Island\r\noff Cape Ann, or even trebling them as at Nauset, on Cape Cod, but\r\nnow the display is made to vary. Thus some of them are simply fixed\r\nwhite lights; some are white and revolve—the whole lantern on the\r\nsummit of the tower being turned on wheels by machinery, and the flame\r\ndisappears for a longer or shorter time; while others are white “flash”\r\nlights, glancing only for an instant, and then lost for a few seconds,\r\nor giving a long wink and then a short one with a space of darkness\r\nbetween. Some lighthouses show a steady red light; others, alternate\r\nred and white. By these colors and varying periods of appearance and\r\ndisappearance (noted on charts, and published by the government in a\r\ngeneral seaman’s guide called the “Coast Pilot”), navigators know which\r\nlight they are looking at when several are in sight. For daylight\r\nrecognition the towers may be painted half black and half white, or in\r\nstripes or bands or spirals, like the big barber’s pole in front of St.\r\nAugustine, Florida.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible here to describe in detail the beautiful machinery\r\nby which the rays from the large but simple argand kerosene lamp are\r\ncondensed into a single beam and projected through the Fresnel system\r\nof condensers and lenses, and by which the revolution and “flashing”\r\nare effected. Petroleum has superseded all other oils for general use,\r\nbut electricity is now being extensively employed in the illumination\r\nof coast lights, especially in France, where they are introducing new\r\nprinciples, such as producing lightning-like flashes with a certain\r\nrecognized regularity, and waving stupendous search-light beams in\r\nthe sky, so that the approach to the coast may be seen when the land\r\nand lighthouse themselves are still below the horizon. If you have an\r\nopportunity to go into the lantern of a lighthouse, by all means take\r\nadvantage of it; and if you can be there when a storm is raging, or\r\nwhen, on some misty night, the lantern is besieged by migrating birds,\r\nyou will never forget the scene.\r\n\r\nOn some especially dangerous—because hidden—shoals, reefs, or bars,\r\nlike those off Nantucket or the extreme point of Sandy Hook, it may be\r\nout of the question or bad policy to erect a lighthouse. Here its place\r\nis taken by anchoring a stout vessel, built to withstand the severest\r\nweather, and arranged to carry lanterns at its mastheads.\r\n\r\nThese are called “lightships,” and they are manned by a crew of keepers\r\nwho have a very monotonous and uncomfortable time of it; yet in some\r\ncases men have spent twenty years or more in the service.\r\n\r\nThe most desolate and dangerous lightship station is that of No. 1,\r\nNantucket. “Upon this tossing island, out of sight of land, exposed\r\nto the fury of every tempest, and without a message from home during\r\nall the stormy months of winter, and sometimes even longer, ten\r\nmen, braving the perils of wind and wave, and the worse terrors of\r\nisolation, trim the lamps whose light warns thousands of vessels from\r\ncertain destruction, and hold themselves ready to save life when the\r\nwarning is vain.”\r\n\r\nSeven years ago Mr. Gustav Kobbé, and the artist, William Taber, spent\r\nseveral days on the lightship and gave a graphic account of the life\r\nthere, which I wish I were able to quote in full.\r\n\r\nThe anchorage is twenty-four miles out at sea beyond Sankaty head,\r\nat the extremity of the shoals and rips which make all that space of\r\nwater beyond the visible coast of Nantucket fatal to ships, hundreds of\r\nwhich are known to have been beaten to pieces on its treacherous bars.\r\nShe is moored to a 6500-pound mushroom anchor by a chain two inches in\r\nthickness, yet she has been torn adrift twenty-three times, and has\r\nwandered widely before returning or being overtaken.\r\n\r\n“No. 1, Nantucket New South Shoals,” to quote Mr. Kobbé,\r\n\r\n  is a schooner of two hundred and seventy-five tons, one hundred and\r\n  three feet long, with twenty-four feet breadth of beam, and stanchly\r\n  built of white and live oak. She has two hulls, the space between\r\n  them being filled through holes at short intervals in the inner side\r\n  of the bulwarks with salt.... She has fore-and-aft lantern-masts\r\n  seventy-one feet high, including topmasts, and directly behind each\r\n  of the lantern masts a mast for sails forty-two feet high. Forty-four\r\n  feet up the lantern-masts are day-marks, reddish brown hoop-iron\r\n  gratings, which enable other vessels to sight the lightship more\r\n  readily. The lanterns are octagons of glass in copper frames five\r\n  feet in diameter, four feet nine inches high, with the masts as\r\n  centers. Each pane of glass is two feet long and two feet three\r\n  inches high. There are eight lamps, burning a fixed white light, with\r\n  parabolic reflectors in each lantern, which weighs, all told, about\r\n  a ton. Some nine hundred gallons of oil are taken aboard for service\r\n  during the year. The lanterns are lowered into houses built around\r\n  the masts. The house around the main lantern-mast stands directly\r\n  on the deck, while the foremast lantern-house is a heavily-timbered\r\n  frame three feet high. This is to prevent its being washed away by\r\n  the waves the vessel ships when she plunges into the wintry seas.\r\n  When the lamps have been lighted and the roofs of the lantern-houses\r\n  opened,—they work on hinges, and are raised by tackle,—the lanterns\r\n  are hoisted by means of winches to a point about twenty-five feet\r\n  from the deck. Were they to be hoisted higher they would make the\r\n  ship top-heavy.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LIGHTSHIP NO. 1, NANTUCKET NEW SOUTH SHOALS.]\r\n\r\n  A conspicuous object forward is the large fog-bell swung ten feet\r\n  above the deck. The prevalence of fog makes life on the South Shoal\r\n  Lightship especially dreary. During one season fifty-five days out of\r\n  seventy were thick, and for twelve consecutive days and nights the\r\n  bell was kept tolling at two-minute intervals.\r\n\r\nThe actual work to be done is small, the daily cleaning of the lamps\r\nrequiring only two or three hours, and other chores being very light,\r\nand the men nearly die of loneliness and “nothing to do.” It is\r\npathetic to read how intense and friendly an interest they take in a\r\nsingle red buoy anchored near them; and they admit that fog is dreaded\r\nmore because it hides this neighbor than for any other reason.\r\n\r\nMr. Kobbé tells us that the emotional stress under which this crew\r\nlabors can hardly be realized by any one who has not been through a\r\nsimilar experience.\r\n\r\n  The sailor on an ordinary ship has at least the inspiration of\r\n  knowing that he is bound for somewhere; that in due time his vessel\r\n  will be laid on her homeward course; that storm and fog are but\r\n  incidents of the voyage: he is on a ship that leaps forward full of\r\n  life and energy with every lash of the tempest. But no matter how\r\n  the lightship may plunge and roll, no matter how strong the favoring\r\n  gales may be, she is still anchored two miles southeast of the New\r\n  South Shoal.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: CLEANING THE LAMPS ON A LIGHTSHIP.]\r\n\r\n  Besides enduring the hardships incidental to their duties aboard the\r\n  lightship, the South Shoal crew have done noble work in saving life.\r\n  While the care of the lightship is considered of such importance to\r\n  shipping that the crew are instructed not to expose themselves to\r\n  dangers outside their special line of duty, and they would therefore\r\n  have the fullest excuse for not risking their lives in rescuing\r\n  others, they have never hesitated to do so. When, a few winters ago,\r\n  the _City of Newcastle_ went ashore on one of the shoals near the\r\n  lightship, and strained herself so badly that although she floated\r\n  off, she soon filled and went down stern foremost, all hands,\r\n  twenty-seven in number, were saved by the South Shoal crew and kept\r\n  aboard of her over two weeks, until the story of the wreck was\r\n  signaled to some passing vessel and the lighthouse tender took them\r\n  off. This is the largest number saved at one time by the South Shoal,\r\n  but the lightship crew have faced great danger on several other\r\n  occasions.\r\n\r\nThis is, perhaps, the extreme picture of lightship life, but apart\r\nfrom the prolonged isolation and continuous roughness of the water,\r\nthe experiences of the men off Sandy Hook and elsewhere are not\r\ngreatly removed from it, and no philanthropy is more worthy of support\r\nthan that which seeks to mitigate the loneliness of these exiles by\r\nproviding them with reading matter. The Lighthouse Board provides a\r\nsmall circulating library for these ships, and contributions of books\r\nand files of illustrated periodicals will be gratefully received and\r\nput to good use by the Superintendent of the Lighthouse Service in\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FOG-BELL.]\r\n\r\nBut there are times—and they occur very frequently in northern\r\nwaters—when fogs which no light can penetrate envelop sea and coast,\r\nand that is the most dangerous of all times to an approaching ship.\r\nThe only means by which a warning can be given, in such an emergency,\r\nis by sound. In many places bells are rung, but often the place to be\r\navoided is so situated that the roar of the surf would drown a bell’s\r\nnote, and then fog-horns are blown. These fog-horns are of a size so\r\nimmense, and voices so stentorian, that it requires a steam engine to\r\nblow them, and they utter a booming, hollow blast, a dismal note as we\r\nhear it when we are safe on the land, but sweet to the anxious captain\r\nwhose vessel is laboring through the gloom under close-reefed topsails,\r\nand uncertain of her exact position. One kind of these horns is very\r\ncomplicated in its structure, and screeches in a rough, broken blare,\r\na note far-reaching beyond any smooth, whistling sound that could be\r\nmade. This shriek is so hideous, so ear-splitting, when heard near at\r\nhand, that no name bad enough to express it could be found; so its\r\ninventors went to the other extreme, and called it a siren, after those\r\nmost enchanting of sweet singers who tried to entice Ulysses out of his\r\ncourse. This name is opposite in a double sense, indeed, for the sirens\r\nof old lured sailors to wreck, while our siren hoarsely bids them keep\r\noff. Finally, buoys, which at first were simply tight casks, but now\r\nare usually made of boiler-iron, are anchored on small reefs, to which\r\nare hung bells, rung constantly by the tossing of their support; and on\r\nother reefs buoys are fixed having a hollow cap so arranged that when a\r\nbig wave rushes over, it shuts in a body of air, under great and sudden\r\npressure, which can only escape through a whistle in the top of the\r\ncap, uttering a long warning wail to tell its position.\r\n\r\nIt is in such times as this that the pilot comes out strong.\r\n\r\nA pilot is a man who has made himself thoroughly acquainted with\r\ncertain waters where navigation is dangerous, and who is licensed\r\nby some proper authority, after training and examination, to direct\r\nvessels in safety in entering harbors or passing through other\r\nintricate places. A ship-captain may be an excellent navigator, but\r\nhe is not expected to know every rock and sandbar crouching under the\r\nwaves, and all the twistings and turnings of the entrance and channel\r\nof a foreign harbor, especially as these channels are subject to\r\nconstant change. In this country, indeed, although coasting-vessels may\r\nrefuse a pilot, the law will not permit captains coming from or bound\r\nto a foreign port to do so; and if any accident happens when no pilot\r\nis aboard the insurance money will not be paid, and the ship’s officers\r\nmay be punished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SIREN RIGGED UPON A MERCHANT STEAMSHIP.]\r\n\r\nPilots, then, are important men and are able to charge very high prices\r\nfor their services (generally rated according to the draft of the\r\nvessel), and their profession is so organized and guarded that not only\r\nmust a man be thoroughly competent, but he must wait for a vacancy in\r\nthe regular number before he will be admitted to their ranks.\r\n\r\nTheir method of work is very exciting. A dozen or so together will\r\nform the crew of a trim, stanch schooner, provisioned for a fortnight\r\nor more, which can outsail anything but a racing yacht, and is built\r\nto ride safely through the highest seas. A few steamers are coming\r\ninto use, but the procedure is much the same. You will now and then\r\nsee one of these beautiful little vessels sailing up the quiet harbor,\r\nthreading its way through the black steamers and sputtering tug-boats\r\nand great ships, as a shy and graceful girl walks among the guests at a\r\nlawn party, and you know from its air as well as the big number on its\r\nwhite mainsail that it is a pilot boat, even if it does not carry the\r\nregular pilot-flag, which in the United States is simply the “union” or\r\nstarry canton of the ensign.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURNING A “FLARE” ON A PILOT-BOAT.]\r\n\r\nBut these fine schooners and the brave men they carry are rarely in\r\nport. Their time is spent far in the offing of the harbor, cruising\r\nback and forth in wait for incoming ships, and the New York pilots\r\noften go two and three hundred miles out to sea, and in storms may\r\nbe blown much farther away. Other pilot-boats are waiting also, and\r\nthe lookout at the reeling mast-head must keep the very keenest watch\r\nupon the horizon. Suddenly he catches sight of a white speck which\r\nhis practised eye tells him is a ship’s top-sails, or of a blur upon\r\nthe sky that advertises a steamer’s approach. The schooner’s head is\r\ninstantly turned toward it, and all the canvas is crowded on that she\r\nwill bear, for away off at the right a second pilot-boat, well down, is\r\nalso seen to be aiming at the same point and trying hard to win.\r\n\r\nThe first pilots of New York harbor were stationed at Sandy Hook, and\r\nvisited incoming vessels in whale-boats; and many a stately British\r\nfrigate or colonial trader was forced to wait anxiously outside the\r\nbar, rolling and tossing in the sea-way, or tacking hither and yon,\r\nhoping for a glimpse of that tiny speck where flashing oars told of\r\nthe coming pilot. It is in this way, as the late Mr. J. O. Davidson,\r\nthe artist, who knew all about such things, told us in “St. Nicholas”\r\n(January, 1890), that many vessels are still met, off some of our\r\nsmaller harbors, and at the mouth of the Mississippi River. There the\r\nwaters of the great river pouring into the Gulf of Mexico through the\r\nPort Eads Jetties make a turbulent swell with foam-crested billows that\r\nroll the stoutest ship’s gunwale under, even in calm weather; yet the\r\nlittle whale-boats, swift and buoyant, dash out bravely in a race for\r\nthe sail on the distant horizon, for there are two pilot-stations at\r\nthe Jetties, and it is “first come first engaged.”\r\n\r\nSometimes, on the other hand, it is the ship that looks for the\r\npilot, cruising about with the code-letters P T flying from her\r\nsignal-halyards in token of her need. She may even run past a\r\npilot-boat in the night and get into danger without being aware of it.\r\nTo prevent this, says Mr. Davidson, the pilots burn what is known as a\r\n“flare” or torch, consisting of a bunch of cotton or lamp-wick dipped\r\nin turpentine, on the end of a short handle. It burns with a brilliant\r\nflame, lighting up the sea for a great distance and throwing the sails\r\nand number of the pilot-boat into strong relief against the darkness.\r\nOn a dark clear night, the reddish glare which the signal projects on\r\nthe clouds looks like distant heat lightning.\r\n\r\nHaving sighted his vessel, the pilot whose turn it is to go on duty\r\nhurries below and packs the valise which contains such things as he\r\nwishes to take home, for this is his method of going ashore; and when\r\nhe has departed, if he is the last one of the pilot-crew, the little\r\nvessel returns herself to port in charge of the sailing-master, cook,\r\nand “boy,” to refit and take on a new set of men.\r\n\r\nThe storm may be howling in the full force of the winter’s fury, and\r\nthe waves running “mountain-high,” but the pilot must get aboard by\r\nsome means. It is rough weather indeed when his mates cannot launch\r\ntheir yawl and row him to where he can climb up the stranger’s side\r\nwith the aid of a friendly rope’s end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PILOT BOARDING A STEAMER.]\r\n\r\nYet frequently this is out of the question. Then a “whip” is rigged\r\nbeyond the end of a lee yard-arm, carrying a rope rove through a\r\nsnatch-block, and having a noose at its end. The steamer slows her\r\nengines, or the ship heaves to, and the pilot-schooner, under perfect\r\ncontrol, runs up under the lee of the big ship, as near as she dares\r\nin the gale. Then, just at the right instant, a man on the ship’s\r\nyard hurls the rope, it is caught by the schooner, the pilot slips one\r\nleg through the bowline-noose, and a second afterward the schooner has\r\nswept on and he is being hoisted up to the yard-arm, but generally\r\nnot in time to save himself a good ducking in the coaming of some big\r\nroller. Going on shipboard in this fashion is not favorable to an\r\nimposing effect; nevertheless, the pilot is welcomed by both crew and\r\npassengers, who admire his courage and trust his skill, but smile at\r\nthe high hat beloved of all pilots.\r\n\r\nNow the pilot is master—stands ahead of the captain even—and his\r\norders are absolute law. He inspects the vessel to form his opinion\r\nof how she will behave, and then goes to the wheel or stands where\r\nbest he can give his orders to the steersman and to the men in the\r\nfore-chains heaving the sounding lead. He must never abandon his post,\r\nhe must never lose his control of the ship, or make a mistake as to\r\nits position in respect to the lee-shore, or fail to be equal to every\r\nemergency. If it is too dark and foggy and stormy to see, he must feel;\r\nand if he cannot do this he must have the faculty of going right by\r\nintuition. To fail is to lose his reputation if not his life. This is\r\nwhat is expected of pilots, and this is what they actually do in a\r\nhundred cases, the full details of any one of which would make a long\r\nand thrilling tale of adventurous fighting for life.\r\n\r\nIt is to help pilots and navigators of all sorts to avoid the perils\r\nthat beset them that governments not only spend large sums in surveying\r\ncoasts and harbors, publishing charts and descriptions, and maintaining\r\nlighthouses and lightships, but mark out bars and channels with\r\nfloating guides, and their borders with shore-beacons and “ranges,” to\r\nform so many finger-posts for the right road. Were it not for these\r\nsign-posts no ship could safely enter any commercial harbor in the\r\nworld; and it will be valuable to quote somewhat from an article, with\r\ncapital illustrations, written for “St. Nicholas” (March, 1896) by an\r\nofficer of the United States Navy, Lieut. John M. Ellicott, since it\r\ndescribes how the long, winding approaches to one of the greatest ports\r\nof the world are marked out by day and by night—I mean the harbor of\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\n  Suppose, then, that we are on a big transatlantic steamer approaching\r\n  the United States from Europe.... Having secured his pilot, it is the\r\n  captain’s next aim to make a “land-fall”—that is to say, he wishes to\r\n  come in sight of some well-known object on shore, which, being marked\r\n  down on his chart, will show him just where he is and how he must\r\n  steer to find the entrance to the harbor.\r\n\r\n  A special lighthouse is usually the object sought, and in approaching\r\n  New York harbor it is customary for steamers from Europe to first\r\n  find, or sight, Fire Island Lighthouse. This is on a sandy island\r\n  near the coast of Long Island. When, therefore, the liner steams\r\n  in sight of Fire Island Light she hoists two signals, one of which\r\n  tells her name and the other the welfare of those on board. The\r\n  operator then telegraphs to the ship’s agents in New York that she\r\n  has been sighted, and that all on board are well or otherwise. [Other\r\n  despatches go to the newspapers, who have observing stations and\r\n  telegraph arrangements here and at Sandy Hook.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DAY-MARKS IN NEW YORK HARBOR.]\r\n\r\n  The ship’s course is then laid to reach the most prominent object at\r\n  the harbor entrance, in this case Sandy Hook Lightship. She is easily\r\n  recognized. The course from this lightship to the harbor entrance\r\n  is laid down on the chart “west-northwest, one quarter west,” and,\r\n  steering this course, a group of three buoys is reached. One is\r\n  a large “nun,” or cone-shaped, buoy, painted black and white in\r\n  vertical stripes; another has a triangular framework built on it, and\r\n  in the top of this framework is a bell which tolls mournfully as the\r\n  buoy is rocked; while the third is surmounted by a big whistle....\r\n  These mark the point where ocean ends and harbor begins, and can be\r\n  found in fair weather or in fog by their color and shape, or noise.\r\n  They are the mid-channel buoys at the entrance to Gedney Channel, the\r\n  deep-water entrance to New York harbor. Here it may be noted that\r\n  mid-channel buoys in all harbors in the United States are painted\r\n  black and white in vertical stripes, and, being in mid-channel,\r\n  should be passed close to by all deep-draft vessels. At this point\r\n  the pilot takes charge.\r\n\r\n  Ahead the water seems now to be dotted in the most indiscriminate\r\n  manner with buoys and beacons, and on the shores around the harbor,\r\n  far and near, there seem to be almost a dozen lighthouses. If,\r\n  however, you watch the buoys as the pilot steers the ship between\r\n  them, you will soon see that all those passed on the right-hand side\r\n  are _red_, and all on the left are _black_. Where more than one\r\n  channel runs through the same harbor, the different channels are\r\n  marked by buoys of different shapes. Principal channels are marked by\r\n  “nun” buoys, secondary channels by “can” buoys, and minor channels by\r\n  “spar” buoys.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: NUN BUOYS.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: CAN BUOYS.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SPAR BUOYS.]\r\n\r\n  Gedney Channel is a short, dredged lane leading over the outer bar,\r\n  or barrier of sand, which lies between harbor and ocean. Its buoys\r\n  are lighted at night by electricity, through submarine cables, the\r\n  red ones with red lights, the black ones with white lights. Moreover,\r\n  a little lighthouse off to the left, known as Sandy Hook Beacon,\r\n  has in its lamp a red sector which throws a red beam just covering\r\n  Gedney Channel. Thus this channel can be passed through in safety by\r\n  night as well as by day. If it is night the pilot knows when he is\r\n  through it by the change of color in Sandy Hook Beacon light from\r\n  red to white. Then he looks away past that light to his left for\r\n  two fixed white lights on the New Jersey shore and hillside, known\r\n  as Point Comfort Beacon and Waackaack Beacon, for he knows that by\r\n  keeping them in range, that is to say, in line with one another and\r\n  himself, and by steering toward them he is in the main ship channel.\r\n  By day the main ship channel buoys would guide him, as in Gedney\r\n  Channel, but at night these buoys are not lighted.\r\n\r\n  Only a short distance is now traversed when the ship comes to a point\r\n  where two unseen channels meet. This is indicated by a buoy having\r\n  a tall spindle, or “perch,” surmounted by a latticed square. From\r\n  here, if she continues on her course, she will remain in the main\r\n  ship-channel, which, although deeper, is a more circuitous route into\r\n  port; so, if she does not draw too much water, she is turned somewhat\r\n  to the right, and, leaving the buoy with the perch and square on her\r\n  right, because it is red, she is steered between the buoys which mark\r\n  Swash Channel. If it were night this channel would be revealed by two\r\n  range-lights on the Staten Island shore and hillside, known as Elm\r\n  Tree Beacon and New Dorp Beacon, both being steady-burning, white\r\n  lights; but we are entering by daylight, and when half-way through\r\n  Swash Channel we notice a buoy painted red and black in horizontal\r\n  stripes. To this is given a wide berth by the pilot. It is an\r\n  “obstruction” buoy marking a shoal spot or a wreck.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OBSTRUCTION BUOY.]\r\n\r\nChannel buoys are all numbered in sequence from the sea inward, the\r\nred ones with even, and the black ones with odd numbers, and the\r\nlarger ones are anchored with “mushrooms” while the smaller have\r\n“sinkers” of iron or stone. They are made of iron plates in water-tight\r\ncompartments, so that if punctured by an over-running ship or some\r\nother accident, they will not be likely to sink. In harbors where ice\r\nforms in winter, large summer buoys are replaced in winter by a smaller\r\nsort less liable to be torn adrift. Buoys do go adrift, however, now\r\nand then, and sometimes take a voyage across the ocean or far down\r\nthe coast before they can be found by the tenders of the Lighthouse\r\nService, which is constantly looking after these and other marks.\r\nLieutenant Ellicott tells us that all changes in the position of buoys\r\nor lightships, or the placing of new buoys to mark a change of channel,\r\nor an obstruction, are published promptly in pamphlets called “Notices\r\nto Mariners,” which are distributed as quickly as possible through well\r\norganized means of communication. A few years ago one of the largest of\r\nour handsome new cruisers was approaching New York harbor from the West\r\nIndies in a light fog. Sandy Hook Lightship had been found, the usual\r\ncourse laid for Gedney Channel, and the ship was steaming onward at\r\nfull speed, her captain, having been inspector of that very lighthouse\r\ndistrict but a short time before, feeling that he knew his way into\r\nthat port better than the most experienced pilot. Presently, however,\r\nhe was startled by the alarming cry of _breakers ahead_! A large hotel\r\nalso loomed up, and, as the ship was backed full speed astern, all\r\nhands realized that they had barely escaped running high and dry on\r\nRockaway Beach. When the vessel got into port it was learned that Sandy\r\nHook Lightship had been moved considerably from its old position, and\r\nthat the notice of this change had failed to reach the captain of the\r\ncruiser before he sailed from the West Indies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A WHISTLING BUOY, OUT OF COMMISSION.]\r\n\r\nShipwrecks still occur, however, in spite of lighthouses and sirens\r\nand buoys and coast-surveys; therefore we add to our precautions\r\narrangements to help those cast away. Societies to save wrecked persons\r\nhave existed, it is said, for many centuries in China, but in Europe\r\nthey are hardly a hundred years old. The early humane societies, like\r\nthat of Great Britain, placed life-boats and rescuing gear in certain\r\nshore towns, and organized crews, who promised to go out to the aid of\r\nany lost ship, and to take good care of the persons rescued.\r\n\r\nIn America, however, our coasts are so extensive, and so much of the\r\ndangerous part of them is far away from villages, or even a farmhouse,\r\nthat the government has been obliged to do whatever was necessary. Thus\r\ncame about the Life Saving Service, which now has its stations close\r\ntogether along our whole sea-coast, and upon the great lakes, covering\r\nmore than ten thousand miles in all.\r\n\r\nEach of these stations is a snug house on the beach, tenanted by a\r\nkeeper and six men, all of whom are chosen for their skill in swimming,\r\nand in handling a boat in the surf—something every man who “follows the\r\nsea” cannot do successfully. Beaching a boat through surf is an art.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PATROLMEN EXCHANGING THEIR CHECKS.]\r\n\r\nDuring all the season, from October till May, two men from each station\r\nare incessantly patrolling the beach at night, each walking until he\r\nmeets the patrolman from the next station. No matter how foul the\r\nweather, these watchmen are out until daylight looking for disasters.\r\nThe moment they discover a vessel ashore, or likely to become disabled,\r\nthey summon their companions and hasten to launch their boat. These\r\nboats are of two kinds. On the lakes and on the steep Pacific coast\r\nis used the very heavy English life-boat, fitted with masts and sails\r\nif necessary, which a steam tug is required to tow to the scene of\r\nthe wreck, unless it is close in shore. But upon our flat, sandy\r\nAtlantic beaches only a lighter kind of surf-boat, made of cedar,\r\ncan be handled. This is built with air-cases at each end and under\r\nthe thwarts, so that it cannot sink. The station men drag it on its\r\nlow wagon to the scene of its use, unless horses are to be had, and\r\nwhen it is launched they sit at the six oars, each with his cork belt\r\nbuckled around him, and his eye fixed on the steersman, who stands in\r\nthe stern, ready to obey his slightest motion of command, for rowing\r\nthrough the angry waves that dash themselves on a storm-beaten beach\r\nis a matter requiring extraordinary skill and strength. Then, when the\r\nvessel is reached, comes another struggle to avoid being struck and\r\ncrushed by the plunging ship, or the broken spars and rigging pounding\r\nabout the hull. But skill and caution generally enable the crew to\r\nrescue the unfortunate castaways one by one, though frequently several\r\ntrips must be made, in each one of which every surfman risks his life,\r\nand in many a sad case loses it; yet there is no lack of men for the\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAVING A SAILOR BY MEANS OF THE BREECHES-BUOY.]\r\n\r\nIt is a common occurrence, however, that the sea will run so high that\r\nno boat could possibly be launched. Then the only possibility of rescue\r\nfor the crew is by means of a line which shall bridge the space between\r\nthe ship and the land before the hull falls to pieces. We read in old\r\ntales of wrecks of how some brave seaman would tie a light line around\r\nhis waist, and dare the dreadful waves, and the more dreadful undertow,\r\nto save his comrades. If he got safely upon the beach, he drew a hawser\r\non shore and made it fast. Now we do not ask this; but with a small\r\ncannon made for the purpose, a strong cord attached to a cannon-ball is\r\nfired over the ship, even though it be several hundred yards distant.\r\nSeizing this line as it falls across their vessel, the imperiled\r\nsailors haul to themselves a larger line, called a “whip,” which they\r\nfasten in a tackle-block in such a way that a still heavier cable can\r\nbe stretched between the wreck and the land and made fast.\r\n\r\nThen by means of a small side-line and pulleys a double canvas bag,\r\nshaped like a pair of knee-breeches, is sent back and forth between\r\nthe ship and the shore, bringing a man each time, until all are\r\nsaved. Should there be many persons on board, though, and great haste\r\nnecessary, instead of the breeches-buoy a small covered metallic boat,\r\ncalled the life-car, is sent out, into which several persons may get\r\nat once. These varied means are so skilfully employed, that now hardly\r\none in two hundred is lost of those whose lives are endangered on the\r\nAmerican coasts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SELF-RIGHTING LIFE-BOAT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nFISHING AND OTHER MARINE INDUSTRIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe grandest sea-chase is that after the whale—the most gigantic of\r\nmammals, the most extraordinary in appearance and habits, and the most\r\nvaluable to man, for the capture of one may mean ten times as much\r\nreward as the ivory of an elephant or the rarest otter-skin would\r\nafford, and perhaps a hundred times as much, if ambergris be found\r\nwithin its body.\r\n\r\nMen have had the hardihood to chase these huge and often savage\r\ncreatures in their own turbulent element, and with the most primitive\r\nweapons, ever since the art of navigation was acquired.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese and other Asiatics of the western shore of the North\r\nPacific have dared to go out in rowboats and attack the largest\r\nwhales since the origin of their traditions, and they had a method of\r\nentangling these leviathans in nets, which must have produced exciting\r\nscenes, as the monster struggled amid the bloody turmoil of waters to\r\nfree himself from the innumerable connected cords that embarrassed his\r\nmovements, rather than subdued his strength, until his life ebbed away\r\nthrough a hundred wounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN OLD WHALER.]\r\n\r\nOn the Alaskan coast, and southward as far as Oregon, the Indians, and\r\nespecially those of the Queen Charlotte Islands and the coasts of the\r\nStrait of Juan de Fuca, were accustomed, hundreds, perhaps thousands\r\nof years ago, to go far away into the ocean in their dug-out canoes,\r\nsearching for and spearing the whales with lances made of flint or\r\nbone, having detachable barbed heads. These were attached to shafts by\r\nrawhide lines, and to the shafts were attached buoys of large inflated\r\nbladders. When the animal was struck, the heavy pole would drive the\r\nlancehead through the skin and then fall off. The barbs would not only\r\nhold the instrument there, but cause it to work deeper and deeper, and\r\nthe whale, darting away or diving, would be so impeded by dragging\r\nthe poles and buoys after him, that he would soon return to receive\r\nother darts, and so, between loss of blood and exhaustion, would\r\nultimately be killed. It is extremely interesting to read the stories,\r\ngathered by early travelers from the lips of the Indians,—old Haidas\r\nor Makahs are living yet who have taken part in such nerve-testing\r\ncanoe-chases,—of their fights with this gigantic foe far from land, and\r\ntheir hair’s-breadth escapes; and it is not strange that many quaint\r\nceremonies were devised to placate the waters and the power of the\r\nwhale-god in advance, and to honor the sea-hunters when they returned.\r\n\r\nThe Greenlanders and Eastern Eskimos do not seem to have been able\r\nin their small skin boats to conquer the largest sort of whales, but\r\nthe smaller ones, such as the white whale, fell to their spears in a\r\nsimilar way; and they took great pains to secure any dead or stranded\r\ncetacean that came within their reach, the bones of which were as\r\nvaluable to them, in the absence of wood, as were the flesh, oil, and\r\nsinews.\r\n\r\nThe history of European whaling begins with the excursions of the\r\nBasques, who, as long ago at least as the tenth century, were\r\naccustomed to go out from their shore-towns in search of the southern\r\nright whale which frequents the Bay of Biscay and its offing. Doubtless\r\ntheir boats were small, half-decked, lugger-rigged “shyppes,” carrying\r\nten to fifteen men, and looking much like many of the Channel fishermen\r\nof to-day. This “fishery” supplied all Europe during the Middle Ages\r\nwith the whalebone and oil which were among the luxuries of the rich at\r\nthat time; but by the time the sixteenth century had arrived, whales\r\nhad become so scarce in the Eastern Atlantic—where now they are almost\r\nextinct—that this industry must have ceased had not the Cabots shown\r\nthe way to Newfoundland, to whose shores the Basques at once extended\r\ntheir voyages with excellent results, for in those days whales were\r\ncommonly seen all along the American shore of the North Atlantic. But\r\nthis remote fishery would have been too precarious and costly to be\r\nof great consequence had it not been for the early efforts, related\r\nin Chapter V, to find a passage to the East north of the continents.\r\nThe earliest of these failed, but they brought back reports that the\r\nedge of the frozen sea abounded in whales, and men rushed into this\r\nnewly discovered field of wealth, as, centuries later, they abandoned\r\neverything in headlong haste to go to the gold-fields of California,\r\nAustralia, South Africa or the Yukon Valley.\r\n\r\nThe English did their best to monopolize the whale fishery at once, but\r\nthe Dutch sent war-vessels, and in a fleet action almost at the edge of\r\nthe ice in 1618 the Dutch conquered and opened the seas to all comers,\r\nwhile separate districts on the coast of Spitzbergen were assigned to\r\neach nationality. The English interest in the fishery declined, but the\r\nDutch increased their attention to it, taking over one thousand whales\r\neach year. “About 1680,” we read, “they had two hundred and sixty\r\nvessels and fourteen thousand seamen employed. Their fishery continued\r\nto flourish on almost as extensive a scale until 1770, when it began\r\nto decline, and finally, owing to the war, came to an end before the\r\nend of the century.” The Germans were always associated with them, and\r\ncontinued to send a whaling fleet to Barentz Sea and the Jan Mayen\r\nwaters until 1873. Meanwhile the Greenland whaling-grounds had begun to\r\nattract British whalemen, followed by the Danes in the early part of\r\nthe last century; then this local industry fell off, but was revived\r\nabout 1800, remained prosperous for many years, and is still the\r\nsupport of Peterhead and a few other Scotch ports.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHALERS TRYING OIL OUT OF BLUBBER.]\r\n\r\nThe abundance of whales near the coast was one of the prime\r\ninducements held out to colonists by North America, where whales\r\noften appeared close to the shore, or in harbors, as occasionally they\r\ndo yet. Here, at first, whale-fishing was pursued wholly in rowboats\r\nlaunched from the beach. Many shore towns owned whaleboats and gear,\r\neach with its trained crew, and some kept a regular lookout, day by\r\nday, whose duty it was promptly to announce the appearance of any whale\r\nin the offing. Such was the case at Southampton, Long Island, for many\r\nyears, and even now, occasionally, the town-crew there rushes away\r\nthrough the breakers after some stray visitor amid the excitement of\r\nthe whole neighborhood, but this happens only at intervals of several\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the seventeenth century, however, the people of\r\nNantucket Island were wont to cruise about the neighboring ocean for\r\nright whales, their voyage lasting six weeks or so as a rule, and\r\nnow and then they would pick up a sperm whale. By the middle of the\r\neighteenth century, however, sperm whaling was no longer profitable\r\nin the Northern Atlantic, while the Greenland grounds were overrun by\r\nEuropean ships. American fishermen therefore turned their attention to\r\nthe West, and for many years confined themselves mainly to catching the\r\nsperm whale, finding at first their best “grounds” in the south-middle\r\nPacific. When the War of Independence came on, Nantucket was the\r\nleading whaling-port of the country, but all the New England towns\r\nwere more or less engaged, and no less than three hundred and sixty\r\nvessels, large and small, were out. The Revolutionary War nearly\r\ndestroyed the industry, and before it could well revive, the War of\r\n1812 again subjected the whaling-ships to capture by English privateers\r\nand men-of-war all over the world. After that, however, they spread\r\nall over the Southern seas, and between 1840 and 1850 more than seven\r\nhundred were flying the flag of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe whaling vessels were large, stanch craft, usually bark-rigged,\r\ndistinguished by their old-fashioned shape, weather-stained, smoky\r\nappearance, enormous boats swinging from end to end of the ship from\r\nlofty davits, and try-works forward. They kept longer than any one\r\nelse many relics of rigging, custom, and language, belonging to the\r\nseamanship of earlier generations; and no sea-peril could daunt either\r\nthe vessel or its crew. They would sail on voyages lasting two or\r\nthree years, and sometimes would circumnavigate the globe and return\r\nwithout having touched at a port. As a rule, however, they would gain\r\npart of a cargo, and then go to some port, ship it to London or New\r\nYork, and refit for a new voyage. The profits of a trip were thus very\r\ngreat sometimes, but other trips were attended only by expense and\r\nmisfortune.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DRAWN BY W. TABER.\r\n\r\nA RACE FOR A WHALE.]\r\n\r\nThe capture of whales in those days had more danger if not more\r\nexcitement than now, for the only method was by rowing after them,\r\nhelped by the sails, in the 28-foot, double-ended rowboats made for the\r\npurpose (of which every vessel carried six or eight), and sinking into\r\ntheir vitals darts and lances until they died. They were then towed\r\nto the vessel’s side, held by tackle from the yard-arms in a suitable\r\nposition, and cut up. The oil in early days was packed in casks, but\r\nlater has been run into iron tanks built into the hold, after having\r\nbeen tried out of the blubber in the great caldrons set in brick on the\r\nforward deck, which gave a whaler so peculiar an appearance, at all\r\ntimes, and would lead any one to suppose her on fire while the process\r\nof trying-out was going on, and the great volumes of black smoke caused\r\nby the use of whale-fat and waste as fuel were drifting to leeward.\r\n\r\nOne of the best accounts of a chase published is that by the late\r\nTemple Brown, of the United States Fish Commission, in an article in\r\n“The Century” for February, 1893, from which I am permitted to make an\r\nextract:\r\n\r\n  While cruising on the coast of New Zealand, one day about 11.30\r\n  A. M., the lookout at the main hailed the deck with: “Thar sh’\r\n  b-l-o-w-s! Thar sh’ b-l-o-w-s! Blows! B-l-o-w-s!”\r\n\r\n  “Where away?” promptly responded the officer of the deck.\r\n\r\n  “Four points off the lee bow! Blows sperm-whales! Blows! Blows!” came\r\n  from aloft.\r\n\r\n  “How far off?” shouted the captain, roused out of his cabin by the\r\n  alarm, as his head and shoulders appeared above deck. “Where are they\r\n  heading?” he continued, as he went up the rigging on all-fours.\r\n\r\n  “Blows about two miles and a half off, sir,” replied Mr. Braxton,\r\n  the mate, looking off the lee-bow with his glasses, “and coming to\r\n  windward, I believe.”\r\n\r\n  “Call all hands!” said the captain. “Haul up the mainsail, and back\r\n  your main-yards. Hurry up there! Get your boats ready, Mr. Braxton!”\r\n\r\n  At the first alarm the men came swarming up the companionway of the\r\n  forecastle, divesting themselves of superfluous articles of clothing,\r\n  and scattering them indiscriminately about the deck. Rolling up\r\n  their trousers, and girding their loins with their leather belts,\r\n  taking a double reef until supper-time, they flitted nervously\r\n  here and there in their bare legs and feet, observing every order\r\n  with the greatest alacrity, and holding themselves in readiness to\r\n  go over the side of the vessel at the word of command. There is\r\n  a certain order, systematic action, or red tape, observed on all\r\n  first-class whaling-vessels, however imperfectly disciplined some of\r\n  the boat-crews may be. The captain indicates the boats he wishes to\r\n  attack the whales; the boat-header (an officer) and the boat-steerer\r\n  (the harpooner) take their proper positions in the boat, the former\r\n  at the stern and the latter at the bow, while suspended in the\r\n  davits. At the proper moment the davit-tackles are run out by men on\r\n  deck, and the boats drop with a lively splash; the sprightly oarsmen\r\n  meantime leap the ship’s rail, and, swinging themselves down the\r\n  side of the vessel, tumble promiscuously into the boats just about\r\n  the time the latter strike the water. Although it may be said that\r\n  there is a general scramble, there is not the least confusion. Every\r\n  person and thing has the proper place assigned to it in a whaleboat;\r\n  the officer has full command, but he is subject to the orders of the\r\n  captain, who signals his instructions from the ship, usually by means\r\n  of the light sails. The manner of going on to a whale, the number of\r\n  men and their positions in the boat, and the kind of instruments and\r\n  the manner of using them, have been perpetuated in this fishery for\r\n  more than two centuries.\r\n\r\n  “Clear away the larboard and bow boats!” shouted the captain. “Get in\r\n  ahead of the whales, Mr. Braxton, if you can. Here, cook, you and\r\n  cooper lend a hand there with them davy-taycles. Are you ready? Hoist\r\n  and swing your boats.”\r\n\r\n  Down went the larboard boat and the bow boat almost simultaneously.\r\n\r\n  “Shove off! Up sail! Out oars! Pull ahead!” were the orders from\r\n  Mr. Braxton, the officer of the larboard boat, in rapid succession.\r\n  “Let’s get clear of the ship. Come, bear a hand with that sail, do,”\r\n  he added, coaxingly, with his eye on the third mate’s boat. “Don’t\r\n  let ’em get in ahead of us.”\r\n\r\n  “All right, sir; here you go, sheet,” replied Vera, the harpooner,\r\n  a well-developed and intelligent American-Portuguese, with his\r\n  accustomed good spirits.\r\n\r\n  Hastily laying aside his paddle, like a tiger couchant, with eager\r\n  eyes upon his prey, he picked up his harpoon, and stood erect, his\r\n  tall, muscular frame swaying above the head of the boat. He placed\r\n  his thigh in the clumsy-cleat,—a contrivance to steady the harpooner\r\n  against the motions of the waves,— and with his long, springy\r\n  arms turned and balanced the harpoon-pole previous to poising the\r\n  instrument in the air.... Under the motive power of sail and paddle\r\n  the space between the boat and whale was rapidly diminishing, and\r\n  apparently they would soon come into collision. The enormous head\r\n  of the cetacean, as it plowed a wide furrow in the ocean, and the\r\n  tall column of vapor rising from the blow-holes, as it spouted ten\r\n  or twelve feet in the air, were to be seen right ahead; the expired\r\n  air, as it rushed like steam from a valve, could be heard near by;\r\n  the bunch of the neck and the hump were plainly visible as they rose\r\n  and fell with the swell of the waves; and the terrible commotion of\r\n  the troubled waters, fanned by the gigantic flukes, left a swath of\r\n  foaming and dancing waves clearly outlined upon the surface of the\r\n  sea....\r\n\r\n  Mr. Braxton laid the boat off gracefully to starboard, and the\r\n  mastodonic head of a genuine spermaceti whale loomed up on our port\r\n  bow. The junk was seamed and scarred with many a wound received in\r\n  fierce and angry struggles for supremacy with individuals of its own\r\n  species, or perhaps with the kraken; the foaming waters ran up and\r\n  down the great shining black head, exposing from time to time the\r\n  long, rakish under-jaw; but what small eyes!\r\n\r\n  “Now!” shouted the officer, as if Vera was a half-mile off, instead\r\n  of about twenty-five feet. “Give him some, boy! Give him—!” But his\r\n  well-trained and faithful harpooner had already darted the harpoon\r\n  into the glistening black skin just abaft the fin; the boat was\r\n  enveloped in a foam-cloud—the “white water” of the whalemen, stirred\r\n  up by the tremendous flukes of the whale.\r\n\r\n  “Stern all!” shouted the officer; and the boat was quickly propelled\r\n  backward by the oarsmen, to clear it from the whale. “Are you fast,\r\n  boy?”\r\n\r\n  “Fust iron in, sir; can’t tell second,” replied Vera; but the\r\n  zip-zip-zip of the line as it fairly leaped from the tub and went\r\n  spinning round the loggerhead and through the chocks, sending up\r\n  a cloud of smoke produced by friction, indicated the presence of\r\n  healthy game.\r\n\r\n  “Wet line! wet line!” shouted Mr. Braxton, as he went forward to kill\r\n  the whale, and Vera came aft to steer the boat, unstepping the mast\r\n  on his way; for all whales are now struck under sail. The whale,\r\n  however, soon turned flukes, and went head first to the depths below.\r\n  Meantime, the other whales had taken the alarm, and with their noses\r\n  in the air, were showing a “clean pair of heels” to windward.\r\n\r\n  The boat lay by awaiting the “rising” of the cetacean. Twenty minutes\r\n  passed, twenty-five, stroke-oarsman began to feel hungry; thirty,\r\n  thirty-five, and still the line was either slowly running out or\r\n  taut; but soon it began to slacken. “Haul line! haul line!” said\r\n  the officer, peering into the water. “He’s stopped.” The line was\r\n  retrieved as fast as possible and carefully laid in loose coils on\r\n  the after platform. “Haul line, he’s coming! Coil line clear, Vera!”\r\n  said Mr. Braxton, shading his eyes with his hand and looking over the\r\n  gunwale at an immense opaque spot beginning to outline itself in the\r\n  depths below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DRAWN BY W. TABER.      ENGRAVED BY J. W. EVANS.\r\n\r\nFAST TO A WHALE.]\r\n\r\n  “Look out! Here he comes! Stern all! Look out for whale!”\r\n\r\n  But the mate’s injunctions were received too late. The whale, fairly\r\n  out of breath, came up with a bound and a puff, scattering the water\r\n  in all directions, and catching the keel of the boat on the bunch of\r\n  its neck. The boat bounded from this part of the whale’s anatomy to\r\n  the hump, and, careening to starboard, shot the crew first on the\r\n  whale’s side and then into the water. The stroke-oarsman now began\r\n  to feel wet. The whale, terrified beyond measure by the tickling\r\n  sensation of the little thirty-foot boat creeping down its back,\r\n  caught the frail cedar craft on one corner of its flukes, and tossed\r\n  it gracefully, but perhaps not intentionally, into the air, as one\r\n  would play with a light rubber ball. As the boat descended, with one\r\n  tremendous “side wipe” of the mighty caudal fin, and with a terrible\r\n  crash that was heard on the ship nearly two miles away, the whale\r\n  smashed it into kindling-wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A WHALE-BOAT CUT IN TWO.]\r\n\r\nThis is only one of the exciting tales Mr. Brown has to tell, and the\r\nhistory of whaling in every country could add many more. He tells us\r\nthat approaching a whale at all times is like going into battle, and\r\nsays that many of the deeds remembered by old hands were purely heroic,\r\nsince the danger might have been avoided by declining to attack the\r\nanimal under the especially hazardous conditions that often present\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe persecution suffered by whales of all kinds in all parts of the\r\nworld made the more valuable kinds so scarce by the middle of the\r\npresent century that many voyages were almost fruitless, not only by\r\nreason of small catches, but because the substitutes invented for\r\nwhalebone, and the constantly increasing use of mineral oils had\r\nlowered prices to an almost ruinous level. The American fleets suffered\r\nwith the rest, until during the Civil War they were nearly swept from\r\nthe seas by the ravages of the _Shenandoah_ and other Confederate\r\nprivateers.\r\n\r\nSince then there has been only a partial revival, accompanied by a good\r\nmany changes. A few Scotch and German whalers still go to the northern\r\nseas, working in the ice, and some American vessels from the Eastern\r\nStates, and a greater number from California search the Pacific and\r\nthe waters off Alaska. All or nearly all of these whalers are provided\r\nwith steam-propellers, having an arrangement by which they can lift the\r\nscrew out of water and use their sails for ordinary purposes. Many of\r\nthem chase with a steam-launch instead of the old-fashioned whaleboats,\r\nand save their men the back-straining labor of towing a prize perhaps\r\ntwo or three miles to the ship. In place of the hand harpoon they have\r\nseveral forms of swivel-guns and shoulder-guns discharging harpoons and\r\nexplosive darts by gunpowder, so that a large share of the danger as\r\nwell as the labor is saved to modern whalemen, who are also much better\r\nhoused and fed in their large iron steamships than those used to be who\r\nwrestled with scurvy in the grim old hulks of half a century ago.\r\n\r\nThe ships that go up through Davis Straits now frequently winter\r\nthere, in order to be on hand in May to meet the whales that appear in\r\nthe first open water, to which the men drag their boats over the ice\r\nbetween their ships and the first open channels. For the same purpose\r\nmany vessels of the American fleet are accustomed to pass the winter in\r\ncompany under the shelter of islands near the mouth of the Mackenzie\r\nRiver. Here they have a rendezvous where buildings have been erected\r\nand means for social comfort have been established, such as billiard\r\ntables, books, etc. These western vessels do not force their way into\r\nand through the ice, as do those among the eastern archipelagoes,\r\nbut operate in comparatively open water, as long as it lasts, along\r\nthe edge of the paleocrystic ice. Delaying the departure of those\r\nwho mean to return to the Pacific and home until the last moment, it\r\noccasionally happens that some are caught and frozen in. These are\r\nusually destroyed, but thus far their crews have managed to escape\r\neither to more fortunate vessels or to the shore, where, at Point\r\nBarrow, the government has built and keeps furnished a strong house,\r\nwith stores, fuel, and provisions, as a refuge for shipwrecked mariners.\r\n\r\nWalrus-hunting is not much followed nowadays by civilized seamen,\r\nthough the animal is still of great value to the Eskimo and Siberians.\r\nIt has become very scarce in easily accessible waters, but is\r\noccasionally taken by whalers, who find a market for the ivory of its\r\ntusks.\r\n\r\nSealing is an industry which still claims considerable attention from\r\nthe Scandinavians and Scotchmen who go to the coasts and waters about\r\nSpitzbergen, Jan Mayen, and Greenland, as well as to nearer resorts,\r\nin pursuit of several species yielding oil and valuable hides; and in\r\nthe North Pacific the pursuit of the fur seal still occupies many small\r\nvessels, but seems likely to come soon to an end. Antarctic seals are\r\npractically extinct.\r\n\r\nThe industry of fishing is probably one of the oldest in the world,\r\nand it remains among the most important, for the fisheries not only\r\nfurnish a vast amount of nutritious and pleasant, yet remarkably cheap,\r\nfood, but many other things useful to mankind. Hence it is not strange\r\nto find that in all the early reports of the discovery of new lands\r\nand waters that followed one another so rapidly from the fourteenth to\r\nthe eighteenth centuries, the fish and other sea-animals to be found\r\nwere always given a prominent place in the list of valuable assets\r\npertaining to each locality. Even the Spaniards and Portuguese, in\r\ntheir insane rush for gold and silver, to the neglect and ruin of\r\neverything else, had to pay some little attention to fishing and allied\r\nindustries in both the East and West Indies; while in the case of the\r\nexploitations of new regions by the calmer, more prudent people of\r\nwestern Europe—the British, French, Dutch and Scandinavians,—the value\r\nof the harvest of the sea was really more in view, at first, than that\r\nof the land, at least when they began to visit and colonize North\r\nAmerica. Take, as an example, the history of St. Pierre, Miquelon, and\r\nthe others that form a group of islets in the Gulf of Newfoundland,\r\nhalf way between Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland. Mr. S. G.\r\nW. Benjamin, in whose “Cruise of the _Alice May_” you may find many\r\ninteresting and picturesque materials for an account of them, tells\r\nus a French settlement was begun on St. Pierre as early as 1604, and\r\nthat tradition says the islands were resorted to by the Basques two\r\ncenturies before that, as is very likely true.\r\n\r\n  In 1713 the colony numbered three thousand souls, and had become a\r\n  very important fishing port. In that very year St. Pierre was ceded\r\n  to Great Britain, together with Newfoundland, the French being merely\r\n  allowed permission to dry their fish on the adjacent shores. But when\r\n  the victory of Wolfe resulted in the loss of Canada to France, she\r\n  was once more awarded this little group of isles lying off Fortune\r\n  Bay, to serve as a depot for her fishermen. The French now gave\r\n  themselves in earnest to developing the cod-fisheries, determined,\r\n  apparently, that what they had lost on land should be made up by the\r\n  sea. In twelve years the average exportation of fish amounted to six\r\n  thousand quintals, giving employment to over two hundred smacks,\r\n  sailed by eight thousand seamen. The English recaptured the isles\r\n  in 1778, destroyed all the stages and store-houses, and forced the\r\n  inhabitants to go into exile. The peace of Versailles restored St.\r\n  Pierre to France in 1783, and the fugitives returned to the island\r\n  at the royal expense. The fisheries now became more prosperous than\r\n  ever, when the war of ’93 once more brought the English fleets to\r\n  St. Pierre. Again the inhabitants were forced to fly. By the peace\r\n  of Amiens, in 1802, France regained possession of this singularly\r\n  evanescent possession, and lost it the following year, when the town\r\n  was destroyed. In 1816 St. Pierre and Miquelon were finally re-ceded\r\n  to France, in whose power they have ever since remained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CURING FISH AT ST. PIERRE.]\r\n\r\nAs these islands were of no use to any one for any other purpose, all\r\nthis struggle for their possession was in order to retain the privilege\r\nand naval control of fishing in those waters. The French government has\r\ncarefully fostered this interest ever since, and now the islands not\r\nonly have a settled population of several thousand, but at the height\r\nof the season sometimes as many as ten thousand strangers (sailors and\r\nfishermen) congregate at the principal port, St. Pierre, which is one\r\nof the most important centers in the world for the marketing, curing,\r\nand export of sea-caught fish.\r\n\r\nOf all waters those of the North Atlantic seem to excel in useful\r\nfishes; from the oil-shark hand-lining off the coast of Lapland, or the\r\nsardine-catching of Spain, to Yankee sword-fishing, this ocean is alive\r\nwith fish and fishermen, on both sides and at all seasons of the year.\r\n\r\nThe whole coast of Norway supports this industry, especially around the\r\nfar northern Lafoden Islands. The North Sea, shallow and cold, is the\r\nhome of many valuable species that are sought by extensive fleets from\r\nDenmark, Holland, and the north of France, while thousands of British\r\nsailors make a living along their own eastern coasts and among the\r\nislands north of Scotland; but the waters on all sides of the British\r\nIsles are fishing waters, especially the English and Irish channels\r\nand the western lochs of Scotland; the herring-catch alone is worth\r\neight and a half millions of dollars a year, while Great Britain’s\r\nmackerel-catch amounts to two millions, and her share of the codfishery\r\nto another two millions. Nearly half of all the products of British\r\nfisheries are obtained by the use of the beam-trawl—a huge dredge-like\r\nbag-net, handled and towed by steamers in pretty deep water, which\r\nscoops in everything near the bottom, where the most desirable\r\nsea-fishes stay. Among the prizes are the turbot and sole—toothsome and\r\nvaluable species not known along American shores.\r\n\r\nMore southerly are the profitable fisheries for pilchards, sprats, and\r\nespecially sardines—little fishes taken in vast numbers and canned or\r\npreserved in various ways. The abundance of sardines, a recent writer\r\ntells us, may be inferred from the fact that the Spanish fishermen\r\ntake annually about one hundred thousand tons of these little fishes,\r\nhaving a value of from $400,000 to $600,000. A peculiar method of\r\ncapturing the sardines at night prevails in the Adriatic. The location\r\nof the shoals of fish is literally felt out by a light sounding-line,\r\nand by means of the attraction of a fire of resinous pine the fish are\r\nslowly coaxed into some creek or estuary and surrounded with a seine.\r\nThe demand for wood for use in this and other night fisheries causes a\r\nserious drain on the neighboring pine-forests.\r\n\r\nThe _great_ fishery of the Mediterranean, however, is that for\r\ntunnies—huge fishes allied to mackerel, sometimes weighing several\r\nhundredweight, and regarded in America as poor food. They have been\r\ntaken by means of pounds and strong enclosing nets ever since classical\r\nantiquity, and preserved tunny flesh is still popular in Spain, Italy,\r\nand North Africa, while the same fish is the object of one of the\r\nprincipal sea-industries of Japan.\r\n\r\nBut important as are the catching, preserving, and utilization of\r\nthese and many other European fishes, they are far outranked by the\r\nmarine fisheries for the cod and its relatives, the halibut, haddock,\r\nhake, etc., in waters about Newfoundland, Labrador, and Iceland, where\r\nalso great quantities of mackerel, herring, and other food fishes\r\nare regularly obtained. The principal grounds are on the Banks of\r\nNewfoundland, which have been resorted to for more than three hundred\r\nyears by men from both continents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAND-LINE FISHING ON THE GRAND BANKS.]\r\n\r\nThe Banks of Newfoundland are a series of shoals—submerged islands,\r\nin fact—which lie off the northeastern coast of America from Cape Cod\r\nto the farther end of Newfoundland. The shallowness of the water over\r\nthem makes them advantageous places for fishing, because many of the\r\nspecies caught remain near the bottom, and in deep water are therefore\r\nbeyond convenient reach. It is possible, also, to anchor there—often a\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\nBut just here are presented some of the worst perils to which fishermen\r\nare exposed. Nowhere are old ocean’s storms worse than on these Banks,\r\nwhere the sand is sometimes stirred five hundred feet below the\r\nsurface. The best fishing comes in winter—the season of the heaviest\r\ngales. The vessels must anchor close together, too, for the areas of\r\ngood fishing are small, and if one breaks its hawser, or the anchor\r\ndrags, there is great danger of drifting afoul of some neighbor, which\r\nis likely to end in the destruction of both. Then there is ever present\r\nthe danger, in these latitudes of almost ceaseless fog, of being run\r\ndown by the transatlantic steamers, in whose track the fishing fleets\r\nmust anchor. The skipper keeps his bell tolling, or a great horn\r\nblowing, but if a steamer comes down the wind her lookout will hardly\r\nbe able to hear it before it is too late to stop or change the course\r\nof the monster rushing at full speed through the thickness of mist and\r\nflying spray. “Before anything can be done the relentless iron prow\r\ncuts into the schooner, which for a moment quivers and then disappears\r\ninto the depths.... One of these great iron ships might cut the bows\r\noff a fishing schooner of sixty or eighty tons and not, perhaps,\r\nexperience a sufficient shock to alarm the passengers sleeping calmly\r\nin their staterooms.”\r\n\r\nThe vessels which go upon this perilous quest are the stanchest,\r\nswiftest, and withal handsomest little vessels that sail our seas.\r\nTheir rig is adapted to this purpose, and spreads almost as much canvas\r\nas a racing-yacht, which, in fact, on this side of the Atlantic has\r\nbeen modeled from Banks fishermen. The best of them probably are those\r\nhailing from Gloucester, Mass., and these are never used for any other\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe old-fashioned hand-line fishing, such as still holds a place in the\r\nmackerel fisheries—although even there it has given way in most vessels\r\nto purse-netting,—is no longer practised in the American codfishery,\r\nwhich now uses the trawl-line altogether, by which the men have added\r\nto the hardship and danger of their adventurous life as well as to its\r\nprofits.\r\n\r\nThis trawl is not a huge dredge as is the beam-trawl of the North\r\nSea fishermen, from which it has unfortunately copied its name, but\r\nis a strong rope between three and four hundred feet long, having at\r\neach end an anchor and a flag-buoy. It is so arranged that when it is\r\nstretched out and anchored the line will be several fathoms beneath the\r\nsurface. To this line, at intervals of six feet or so, are hung short\r\nlines, each carrying a stout hook. When the fishing-ground has been\r\nreached, the captain anchors his vessel, or, if the weather permits, he\r\nsails gently to and fro. Previously, six trawls have been baited with\r\nclams brought from home, and one put in each of the six small boats\r\nwhich the vessel carries. Two men now put off in each of these boats\r\nand anchor the trawls at convenient distances from each other, in such\r\na way that the trawl-line, with its fringe of hooks, shall be stretched\r\ntaut and at the proper depth. How long they stay down depends on the\r\nweather—five or six hours, or from evening until morning, is the usual\r\nperiod. Then the men go out, and taking up the anchors at one end, haul\r\neach trawl into the boat, coiling it in the bottom and taking off the\r\nhooks each captive fish as fast as they come to it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FISHING SCHOONER “HOVE TO” IN A GALE ON THE BANKS.]\r\n\r\nSimple as this sounds, it is terribly hard work. The trawls are heavy\r\nand stiff, and armed with dangerously sharp hooks. The busiest season\r\nis midwinter, and no dread of cold or danger must stop the fisherman,\r\nwho boldly ventures in his little dory into the teeth of a howling\r\nsnow-storm and fast increasing gale, piling the water “mountain-high”\r\nabout him and encasing his body in a sheet of icy spray; this must\r\nhe do, in spite of discomfort and the imminent risk of death, if he\r\nwould save from destruction his valuable trawls and the booty they may\r\nhave hooked for him. A fine day on the Banks of Newfoundland is a rare\r\nthing; fog and snow and icy gales are the rule, and only the boldest\r\ncourage, endurance, and skill will enable a man to resist that ocean\r\nand wrest from it his self-support. A vivid picture of the hardships\r\nand dangers of fishing on the Banks is to be found in Rudyard Kipling’s\r\nstory, “Captains Courageous.”\r\n\r\nThe intrepid and skilful voyages of our whalers and fishermen, daring\r\nevery fatigue and danger in the open sea, have been schools for the\r\nbest seamen of the world. Every nation is glad to draw these sailors\r\ninto their navies, and it is they who make the bravest yet most\r\ncautious captains of our merchant marine, showing to their comrades\r\nand to landsmen splendid examples of heroism and fortitude. _This_ is\r\nthe schooling I meant when I said that in its industries we get not\r\nonly food, but formation of character, from old Ocean,—and this is the\r\nhighest result attainable from either land or sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: shipwreck]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE PLANTS OF THE SEA AND THEIR USES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ocean was the home of the first living thing, either plant or\r\nanimal, that appeared on our planet; seaweeds and salt-water animals\r\nare found in much older rocks than any that contain the fossils of land\r\nlife. Moreover, though called a “wide waste of waters,” and seeming a\r\ncomplete desert as we gaze upon its restless surface on a dull morning,\r\nthere is a greater number of animals and plants by count, and quite\r\nas large a variety, under the waves as above them, and the bottom of\r\nthe sea—at all events near its margin—is more populous than any bit of\r\nwoods you ever saw.\r\n\r\nThere exists in our ponds and ditches a race of plants so minute\r\nthat it requires a powerful microscope to examine them. Under this\r\ninstrument it is seen that they have delicate, flinty shells or armor,\r\nwhich is of a great variety of forms,—coiled, globular, boat-shaped,\r\nspindle-like, and so on,—and always beautifully sculptured. These\r\nminute and beautiful diatoms, as they are called, move about freely,\r\nand were long supposed to be animals; now they are known to be the\r\nsimplest of seaweeds, consisting of only one cell. Since life first\r\nbegan, these diatoms, and other microscopic plants much like them, have\r\nswarmed not only in the fresh waters, but in all the oceans of the\r\nglobe, furnishing food for mollusks and all the lowly animals whose\r\nfood is brought into their mouths by the currents. Innumerable, and as\r\nwide-spread as the salt water itself, every one of these myriads of\r\nminute plants has left a record; for its delicate, glass-like shell\r\nwas indestructible, and when the bit of life was lost, it sank slowly\r\ndown to the bottom. What effect toward perceptible sediment could come\r\nfrom a thing so small that it would scarcely be felt in your eye? One\r\nor two, or even a million, would go for little; but century after\r\ncentury, through ages too long for us to comprehend, a steady rain of\r\nthese exquisitely engraved particles of flint showered down upon the\r\nstill sea-floor, almost as thickly as you have seen motes in a sunbeam,\r\nuntil there was deposited a layer, many feet in thickness, of nothing\r\nbut diatom-skeletons. Though this went on to a greater or less extent\r\neverywhere in the sea, such deposits are not now to be discovered\r\neverywhere, because disturbing causes swept the shells away, or broke\r\nup the floor after it had been laid down; but in various parts of the\r\nworld to-day, you may find wide beds of rock made up wholly of such\r\nskeletons, soldered together into hard stone; while in some regions the\r\nmud of our sea-bottom appears to consist of almost nothing else. The\r\nmighty chalk cliffs of Great Britain and the French coast were built up\r\nin precisely this way at the bottom of an ancient sea, whence they have\r\nbeen lifted, but they are composed of much besides diatoms.\r\n\r\nFrom the simplicity of diatoms the vegetation of the sea can be traced\r\nupward through larger and more complicated kinds of plants until\r\nwe reach the enormous algæ that break the gloom of black headlands\r\nby their brilliant tints, and furnish a lurking-place under their\r\nwide-spreading and dense foliage for hosts of marine animals—some\r\nhiding for safety, others to watch for prey.\r\n\r\nSeaweeds grow in all latitudes, even close to the pole, but mainly\r\nalong the shore, for below the depth of about one hundred fathoms none\r\nbut microscopic forms are known. These latter float about, of course,\r\nand many of them have been thought to be animals because they seem able\r\nto move at their own will. They come to the surface as well as haunt\r\nthe depths; and the Red Sea takes its name from the fact that a minute\r\ncarmine-tinted alga occasionally rises to the surface in throngs so\r\ndense and wide as to tinge the water for miles at a stretch. The same\r\nthing occurs in the Pacific, where the sailors call it “sea-sawdust.”\r\n\r\nThe proper home of the seaweed, however, is a rocky shore between\r\ntide-marks or just below them, and it is because the eastern coast\r\nof the United States is deficient in rocks—at least south of Cape\r\nCod—that this is poor in algæ, compared with other regions. The seaweed\r\nhas no roots, and only clings to the rock for support; shifting sand\r\ntherefore would not hold it, and there are great sandy deserts under\r\nthe ocean, bare of algæ, as some land regions are sandy deserts naked\r\nof terrestrial plants.\r\n\r\nIt often happens, however, that masses of weed will be torn away from\r\ntheir moorings and set adrift. This does not necessarily kill them,\r\nfor they go on flourishing while afloat, and such is supposed to be\r\nthe origin of those great areas of “gulfweed” vegetation in mid-ocean\r\ncalled “sargasso seas.” You will remember that a branch of the Gulf\r\nStream, striking over toward the Moorish coast of Africa, is turned\r\nsouthward there, and sweeps down to the equator, then westward again,\r\ncircumscribing a broad region in the middle Atlantic whose only\r\ncurrents go round and round in a slow whirlpool; and here it is that\r\nthe gulfweed concentrates in masses sometimes dense enough to impede\r\nthe progress of a ship—Columbus reported among the wonders of his first\r\nvoyage the trouble he had in sailing through it—and covering an area\r\nbetween the Azores and the Bahamas as large as the Mississippi valley.\r\nThis is the Sargasso Sea ordinarily referred to in books, but it is not\r\nthe only one. A thousand miles west of San Francisco there is a similar\r\ncollection of floating plants, and others exist under like conditions\r\nin the southern oceans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MARBLED ANGLER ON ITS GULFWEED RAFT.]\r\n\r\nThese floating meadows, as it were, are chosen as the abode of a\r\nlong list of animals that rarely quit the safety and plenty of their\r\nprecincts. Among these are innumerable pretty jelly-fishes, sea-worms,\r\nand mollusks without shells, which cling to the buoyant plants, and\r\nperhaps feed solely upon them. Here are to be had in abundance the\r\nfairy-like, rare pteropods, the richly purple janthinas towing their\r\ncurious rafts of eggs, and no end of small crabs. Here a small fish,\r\nsomething like a perch, spends his whole time building a nest like a\r\nbird’s in the tangled weed-masses, and carefully guarding his treasures\r\nagainst the large marauding fishes that haunt the place to the dread\r\nof its peaceful inhabitants; and here those far-flying birds, the\r\nwandering albatross and the petrels, hover about in search of something\r\nto capture and eat. The Sargasso Sea is an extremely interesting part\r\nof the ocean, except to the luckless sailor becalmed and balked in its\r\nmidst, as was Sir John Hawkins when he penned the following quaint\r\nobservations, some three centuries ago:\r\n\r\n  Were it not for the Moving of the Sea, by the Force of Winds, Tides\r\n  and Currents, it would corrupt all the World. The Experience of\r\n  which I Saw _Anno_ 1590, lying with a Fleet about the Islands of\r\n  Azores, almost Six Months, the greatest Part of the time we were\r\n  becalmed, with which all the Sea became so replenished with several\r\n  sorts of Gellies and Forms of Serpents, Adders and Snakes, as seem’d\r\n  Wonderful; some green, some black, some yellow, some white, some of\r\n  divers Colours, many of them had Life, and some there were a Yard &\r\n  a half, & some two Yards long; which had I not seen, I could hardly\r\n  have believed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PIECE OF GULFWEED.\r\n\r\nIt is inhabited by two sea-slugs, protected by their resemblance to its\r\nleaflets, and by small crustaceans, hydroids, etc.]\r\n\r\nIn favorable places a surprising variety of seaweeds can be picked out,\r\nand books exist by which you may learn the method of classification\r\nand names of the different species, the chief of which, for America,\r\nis Harvey’s splendid work, published by the Smithsonian Institution.\r\nNot only in the shape and colors of the _fronds_ (as the leaf-like\r\nexpansions or branching tufts of the stem are called) do seaweeds\r\ndiffer greatly among themselves, but in size, varying from many\r\ndiminutive or even microscopic sorts to the cable-like growths of\r\nCalifornia, which would measure a quarter of a mile in length if\r\nstretched out.\r\n\r\nAlgæ, as I have said, constitute, with very few exceptions, the whole\r\nvegetation of the salt water, together with a large part of the\r\nvegetation in fresh water; and they serve the same useful purpose there\r\nthat land-plants do for the dry parts of the globe, continually making\r\nand throwing off the oxygen which is necessary to keep the water as\r\nwell as the air pure. To this end they do a very important work.\r\n\r\nThis is not the whole of their service in ocean matters, however. I\r\nthink it may be said that if it were not for seaweeds animals could not\r\nlive in the ocean, as truthfully as that if it were not for herbage no\r\nanimals would be able to exist on land. Seaweeds are fed upon directly\r\nby all sorts of salt-water life, from mollusks as big as your thumb\r\nto turtles the size of a dining-table, and they make a shelter for\r\nthousands of little fellows who never leave their shadow.\r\n\r\nBut this is a small part of the story. The diatoms, and other minute\r\nplants like them, form the main portion, if not all, of the food of\r\na large number of sponges, polyps, mollusks, and other stationary,\r\nsluggish creatures, that otherwise, so far as I see, would not be able\r\nto live at all. These, in turn, are fed upon by larger predaceous\r\nanimals. Thus, though the fishes and cetaceans may never bite a seaweed\r\nthemselves (those large marine herbivores, the manatee and dugongs,\r\nsubsist almost wholly upon it, however), they depend for food upon\r\ncreatures that do. We may say, therefore, that the algæ form the basis\r\nof all ocean life.\r\n\r\nMen have been able to make marine plants of service to them also—a\r\nresource more important formerly than now. In the last century, for\r\nexample, the kelp trade was the one great industry of the islands at\r\nthe west of Ireland and Scotland, employing thousands of persons, and\r\npaying vast revenues to the lordly owners of the shores. Kelp is the\r\nname of any large, leathery sort of seaweed, whose leaves float at or\r\nnear the surface, supported by bladder-like expansions; but in this\r\ncase the word meant the ashes of any seaweed dried in the sun and then\r\nslowly burned in kilns, clouding the air with huge volumes of strongly\r\nodorous smoke. The slow burning of the seaweed left the ashes fused\r\ninto a solid mass, which was broken up like stone before being sold. In\r\nFrance this substance was called _varec_; and in Spain, where the algæ\r\nwere mixed with beach-plants, cultivated for the purpose, and burned in\r\nshallow pits in the ground, it went to market as _barilla_.\r\n\r\nIn those days, kelp ash was the only source of the valuable alkali\r\nsoda needed in manufacturing glass and soap. Then a French chemist\r\ndiscovered how to make such soda out of common salt, and the kelp\r\novens were abandoned, except a few in Scotland, supplying the demand\r\nfor iodine and several other chemicals contained in this residuum which\r\nis so rich in iodine, used in photography and in medicine, that a ton\r\nof kelp ash will sometimes yield twenty pounds; yet only about 100,000\r\npounds are now produced in this way, while five times as much is\r\nobtained by chemical treatment of Chile saltpeter. It is a curious fact\r\nthat barbarous people have long chewed seaweeds as a remedy in diseases\r\nfor which physicians now prescribe iodine. Iodine is a violet dye,\r\nand the bluish and purple tints of many algæ, shells, and sea-animals\r\nappear to be due to the large amount of this element in sea-water.\r\n\r\nSeaweeds and other marine plants, like eel-grass, are collected in\r\ngreat quantities by farmers in all parts of the world to be used as a\r\nfertilizer. Shell-mud, dead fish, and other marine products are also\r\nof high value as manure, on account of the large proportion of lime,\r\ncarbon, and soda which they contain. Indeed, there is a kind of seaweed\r\ngrowing at great depths called the nullipore, which takes up so much\r\nlime from the water that its substance becomes almost like stone, so\r\nthat the plant retains its shape and full size when dried. Some of\r\nthese nullipores are beautifully fan-shaped, scarlet or pink, and are\r\noften seen in museums, marked _corallines_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEAWEEDS.\r\n\r\n1. _Laminaria digitata._ 2. _L. longicruris._]\r\n\r\nTo return to the gathering of seaweeds by farmers, nowhere is it more\r\ncustomary than in some parts of New England. Thus the well-known Second\r\nBeach, just east of Newport, is in the fall of the year the scene of\r\na vast activity in this direction. “It may easily happen,” we are\r\ntold, “that the pilgrim to Whitehall, topping the hill on a brilliant\r\nautumn morning, shall come upon a scene in which quiet plays no part.\r\nThe seaweed, that harvest which, ripening without labor, is neither\r\nbought nor sold, is setting inshore under the urgings of wind and\r\ntide, and scores of farmers have crowded to the spot to gather it.\r\nAn artist could hardly wish a better subject for his pencil than one\r\nof these wild harvestings—the plunging horses, forced far out into\r\nthe surf, their slow return, half swimming, half wading, dragging\r\nthe heavily loaded rakes which leave behind them a long furrow of\r\nfoam, the heaped-up kelp glistening in the sunshine, the oxen, yoked\r\nby fours, waiting for their load, the shouts of the men, the dash,\r\nthe excitement, and beyond and above all, the wonderful blues and\r\niridescent greens which are the peculiar property of Newport waters and\r\nthe Newport sky.”\r\n\r\nCattle and horses that are accustomed to rough pastures, like the\r\nScotch and Irish moors, eat seaweed and thrive on it, especially as\r\nwinter fodder, and from several species are derived dishes for our own\r\ntables. The Irish moss, or carrageen,—which is not a moss at all, but\r\na seaweed,—is the most important of these, and grows on both sides of\r\nthe northern Atlantic. In England the market supply comes chiefly from\r\nthe western coast of Ireland, while Massachusetts Bay gives America all\r\nthat is wanted, principally the red, coral-like _Chondrus crispus_. The\r\nlittle port of Scituate, Massachusetts, is the chief point of supply,\r\nwhere many thousands of pounds are gathered. In early June, two or\r\nthree hundred men and women go to the rocks at low tide and pick off\r\nthe small brown plants, each man getting about a barrel in one day’s\r\nwork. When the tide rises, the people get into small boats and pull up\r\nthe moss with rakes.\r\n\r\nThe moss gathered each day is taken to the beach, where a gravelly\r\nspace has been prepared, and is spread out to lie bleaching during all\r\nof the next day, when it is taken up, washed in tubs, and again spread\r\nout. The washing and drying in the sun continue for seven days, by\r\nwhich time it has bleached to a yellowish white. In cookery, jellies,\r\n_blanc mange_, and various methods of boiling in milk and mixing in\r\nsoups are used to make it palatable. Besides being of value for food,\r\ncarrageen serves to make sizing used by paper-makers, cloth-printers,\r\nhatters, and so on, to clarify beer in the brewery vats, as a medicine,\r\nand to make bandoline for stiffening the hair.\r\n\r\nOther species beside the Irish moss serve as food in Europe, generally\r\nin a raw state, often proving the only salty relish which the Irish\r\npeasant has to eat with his potatoes. One of these is the _dulse_\r\nof the Scotch (the _dillisk_ of Ireland), which also abounds in the\r\nMediterranean, and is there made into a soup. The natives of the South\r\nSea Islands eat algæ, which are extraordinarily abundant and varied in\r\nOriental latitudes; and the poor among the Japanese and in the interior\r\nof China, where the weed is sent dried, prize it especially, because it\r\nhas a sea flavor and saves salt, which with them is a costly luxury.\r\nThese people mix it with vegetables and other materials, to form\r\nthick, delicious soups and dressings. A peculiarly bad-smelling sauce,\r\nprepared from seaweed, is among the exports China sends to Europe as a\r\ncondiment.\r\n\r\nAlong the shores from Japan to Sumatra grows an alga which the natives\r\nof those coasts dry and keep as long as they please. When the substance\r\nis wanted they steep some of the dried pieces in hot water, where the\r\nweed dissolves, and then, having been taken off the fire, stiffens\r\ninto a glue which is said to be the strongest cement in the world.\r\n\r\nA kind of false isinglass, also, is a product of the Eastern seaweeds,\r\nand it not only enters into the pastry and confectionery of Chinese\r\nbakers, but serves to varnish and glue thin paper and to stiffen the\r\nlight transparent gauzes of fine silk used in making Oriental screens,\r\nfans, hangings, etc., so that painters can decorate them. With a poorer\r\nquality the bamboo stretchers of paper umbrellas, lanterns, and various\r\ntoys are smeared to give them hard and polished surfaces.\r\n\r\nSeaweed has also been used in the manufacture of paper, and its\r\ncomplete success in this branch of industry is as yet hindered only\r\nby the difficulty of perfect bleaching. Certain species of it are\r\nutilized in enormous quantities by upholsterers as stuffing for sofas,\r\nchairs, and mattresses; in Japan it is formed into a substitute for\r\nwindow-glass; ornaments and small articles of use, like knife-handles,\r\nare made by several nations out of large dried seaweeds; and, finally,\r\nalbums of preserved fronds are one of the prettiest things to be found\r\nin a naturalist’s cabinet.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of seaweeds grow between tide-marks, and they\r\nundoubtedly perform an important service in preventing the wear and\r\ntear of the coast in many situations. Some, however, grow in much\r\ndeeper waters, and these, also, may serve as breakwaters of no mean\r\nstrength. Such is the case, for instance, at San Pedro, near Los\r\nAngeles, California, where the abundant growth offshore forms such a\r\nbarrier to the ocean rollers as to turn the open roadstead into a calm\r\nharbor within it.\r\n\r\nThis belongs to the group of gigantic kelps of which those at the\r\nFalkland Islands and about Tierra del Fuego are other and noted\r\nspecies. Were it not for the growth of this strong, cable-like, buoyant\r\nplant, large numbers of other plants and sea-animals would find it\r\nimpossible to exist exposed to the violence of the South Pacific waves.\r\nSometimes the stems reach twelve hundred feet in length, and the\r\nbladders by which the immense fronds are buoyed up are as big as kegs.\r\n\r\nThis gigantic seaweed is plentiful all along the Pacific coast of\r\nAmerica to Alaska, and the natives of our northwest coast used to make\r\nextensive use of it in the way of ropes, etc. It was from this weed\r\nthat, by a careful preparation, they made the lines for their harpoons\r\nand deep-sea fishing; and the bladders furnished them ready-made\r\nreceptacles for eulachon oil, for water for their seatrips, and for\r\nother liquids.\r\n\r\nA California correspondent of the New York “Evening Post” gave a pretty\r\npicture, not long ago, of one of the kelp patches at St. Nicholas\r\nIsland, where the beds of this wonderful plant reach out for a mile\r\nor more, growing up from the rocks below and forming an effectual\r\nbreak; the seas losing their force in their effort to pass through the\r\nsubmarine meshwork.\r\n\r\n  The vines constitute a veritable forest, and, drifting over it in\r\n  fifty or sixty feet of water, you may see a perfect maze of stems\r\n  with broad leaves waving gracefully in the current, forming arbors,\r\n  arches, and colonnades. Here, poised idly, in rich contrast to the\r\n  olive-hued mass, may be seen fish of a bright golden color, others\r\n  in tints of blue and green. The sea swell coming in causes an\r\n  undulatory movement, and the long colonnades seem to melt one into\r\n  another, reappearing in different shapes. When the leaves reach the\r\n  surface, the shore wind, sweeping down from the hills, lifts them\r\n  from the water, and they flutter in the air like mimic sails. Each\r\n  leaf is a study. Many are encrusted with a delicate bryozoön, which\r\n  presents the effect of white lace upon the surface, while a close\r\n  inspection will reveal minute anemones, coiled tubular worms, which\r\n  throw out flower-like organs of exquisite beauty; while flat shells\r\n  lie among them, and crawling here and there are marvels of animal\r\n  life, shell-less mollusks, which so mimic the weed that it is almost\r\n  impossible to distinguish them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIATOMS, MAGNIFIED, IN A DROP OF WATER.]\r\n\r\n  This protective feature is a characteristic of life among the kelp\r\n  forests that line the entire Pacific shores of North and South\r\n  America, many animals simulating it so perfectly in color that the\r\n  best-trained eyes often fail to observe them. This is especially\r\n  true of the crabs and shell-less mollusks. The latter have not only\r\n  assumed the exact tint of the weed, but are often covered with\r\n  barbels of flesh that simulate the tangles of the substance. Upon the\r\n  backs of the crabs are singular markings in green and white, which\r\n  so resemble the minute incrustations of the kelp that the resultant\r\n  protection is complete. [Compare illustration on page 252.] Each vine\r\n  is fastened to a stone, and the clinging roots shelter hordes of\r\n  creatures of various kinds—deep-water crabs, octopods, starfishes,\r\n  and a host of others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MARINE NATURALIST.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nANIMAL LIFE IN THE SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primitive idea of the ocean was that it was a vast desert, and a\r\nstrange disbelief in its being inhabited by more than the very few\r\nforms that everybody was compelled to recognize persisted up to quite\r\nmodern times among those who should have known better. Pliny boldly\r\nasserted, for example, that nothing remained in the Mediterranean Sea\r\nunknown to him after he had made a list of 176 marine animals! But now\r\nwe know that the sea teems with living beings as densely as do the\r\nfresh waters or the air. In it began the life of the globe, for the\r\nfossil records of the rocks show that the first animals lived in the\r\nocean, and that ages passed before any of them began to people the\r\nnewly formed lands and breathe the atmosphere instead of the air in the\r\nwater; and, abundant as oceanic life now is, the paleozoic seas held\r\nimmensely greater hordes, of which many forms were giants as compared\r\nwith those of our day. Some of the old straight chambered shells were\r\ntwelve feet long; and I have seen fossil ammonites, extinct relatives\r\nof our coiled pearly nautilus, which when alive must have been too\r\nheavy for a man to lift. The fishes, too, could tell great stories of\r\nthe glory of their ancestors in size and strength and numbers. Some of\r\nthem wore solid coats of mail upon their heads, and could do battle\r\neven with the huge swimming reptiles that were the dreaded tyrants of\r\nthe Mesozoic deep.\r\n\r\nLife in the ocean in those old geologic days was a long guerrilla\r\nwarfare—every animal guarding against attack, and at the same time\r\nwatching sharply for an opportunity to seize and prey upon some weaker\r\ncompanion. As for the foraminifers and other microscopic creatures,\r\nthey were countless, and their skeletons, singly invisible, have by\r\naccumulation built up great masses of rock, like the chalk-beds of\r\nEngland and France.\r\n\r\nThough lessened in numbers and reduced in size, because the land has\r\ngradually won over to its side many sorts of animals which in former\r\nages were exclusively confined to the water, and for other reasons, the\r\nsea still holds its share of every “branch” and “class” (except birds,\r\nand it may almost claim some of them, such as the albatross, penguins,\r\nand petrels), and a majority of the “orders” of animal life. Glance at\r\nthe catalogue: Foraminifers, sponges, and polyps are chiefly confined\r\nto salt water; starfishes, urchins (or sea-eggs), and the like, wholly\r\nso: mollusks (next higher) are principally oceanic, and the majority\r\nof the crabs inhabit salt water. Among the last-named one species, the\r\ncommon horse-foot (_Limulus_) of our shores, remains as the solitary\r\nrepresentative of that immense and varied group, the trilobites, which\r\nso crowded the Paleozoic sea-bottom that some rocks—for instance, the\r\nlimestones of Iowa—are packed almost as full of their fossils as is a\r\nraisin-box of raisins.\r\n\r\nNone of the insects is truly marine, yet some of them are seafaring,\r\ntruly, for they spend their lives on drifting sea-wrack, or on beaches\r\njust out of reach of the tides; but most of the true worms are dwellers\r\nin the mud of sea-shores and sea-bottoms. No one knows of any land\r\nfishes; but I need not tell you that fishes throng in the fresh waters\r\nas well as in the salt, and that many species inhabit both at different\r\nseasons.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the reptiles, of which the ancient oceans contained\r\ngigantic and horrid types, I do not know any now that are truly oceanic\r\nexcept the turtles, if you leave out the “sea-serpent,” of which we\r\nhear so many wonderful and not quite satisfactory tales. You will hear\r\nof “sea-snakes” in the East Indies, but they are only certain kinds\r\nof serpents which swim well, and pass the most of their time in the\r\nsalt water, as several species of our own country do in the rivers and\r\nponds; all the oriental sea-snakes are venomous.\r\n\r\nIt is in this manner, too, that we may count certain birds, such as the\r\npetrels, auks, penguins, albatrosses, frigate-birds, and their kin,\r\nas belonging to the ocean. They spend all their life flying over the\r\nwaves, seeking their food there, and some of them rarely go ashore,\r\nexcept to lay their eggs and hatch their young on remote rocks, resting\r\nand sleeping on the billows, when not busy at their hunting. In the\r\nhighest rank of all, however, the mammals, several families are natives\r\nof the “great deep”—the whales, dolphins, and porpoises, the seals and\r\nwalruses, and the manatees and dugongs. But all these must come to the\r\nsurface to breathe, not having gills like fishes, but true lungs.\r\n\r\nAs it is only within the last thirty years that machinery suitable\r\nfor deep-sea dredging has been invented, so it is only lately that we\r\nhave been able to learn much as to the population of the ocean beneath\r\nthe surface layer and marginal shallows. Now by means of beam-trawls,\r\ndredges, tangle-bars, etc., worked by steam-machinery on shipboard,\r\nnaturalists may scrape up the bottom-ooze and obtain living objects\r\nor their bony relics at the depth of even 3000 to 4000 fathoms or more\r\nthan four miles, for living beings are found in these profound abysses.\r\nMany scientific expeditions, such as those of the English exploring\r\nsteamer _Challenger_, about 1874, have carried out these dredging\r\ninvestigations, and the United States Fish Commission possesses the\r\nlarge, specially built, sea-going _Albatross_, provided with all the\r\nnecessary apparatus for deep-sea exploration. By means of these and\r\nother vessels an enormous amount of study—all useful in ascertaining\r\nthe habits and methods of reproduction of food-fishes—has been carried\r\non by American marine naturalists.\r\n\r\nIt appears that as you go further and further from shore, and into\r\ndeeper and deeper water, the fewer animals and plants are obtained, and\r\nthat very few species indeed which live along shore are to be found\r\nalso at a depth greater than about 100 fathoms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LANDING THE BEAM-TRAWL ON DECK.]\r\n\r\nAlmost all animals, moreover, have a limited distribution in the\r\nsea, as is the case among those on land, though we cannot always, or\r\nperhaps often, say why the limits we find should exist; one sort of\r\ncrab, or mollusk, or polyp, appearing _here_ and another different one\r\nexclusively _there_, when the conditions seem to us very similar, and\r\nno barrier is perceptible. It is not easy to explain why a certain\r\nsort of cowry, for example, should be found only along a particular\r\nstrip of coast, when nothing that we can see prevents its extending\r\nits range much further. It is believed that the _temperature_ of the\r\nwater is the chief fact which sets these invisible boundaries to the\r\nwanderings of animals living near the surface, only a few of which are\r\nvery wide-spread in their distribution. The direction and character of\r\nthe ocean currents have much to do with the geographic distribution of\r\noceanic life, as has been mentioned in Chapter II (page 25).\r\n\r\nNow in deep-sea life the case is different. Here temperature cannot be\r\nof so much account, since only a short distance down, the water becomes\r\nalmost as cold as ice, and preserves this uniform chill all around\r\nthe globe. The life found at a great depth, too, is very wide-spread,\r\ninstead of restricted in its range, often occurring in two or more\r\nocean basins; but here the restriction is an up-and-down one, rather\r\nthan horizontal, and the secret is found in the word _pressure_. Few\r\nanimals are able to live both in the shallows and under the enormous\r\nweight of sea water three or four miles deep.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TYPICAL JELLYFISH.\r\n\r\nThis species (_Pelagia cyanella_) is a characteristic oceanic\r\ndiscophorous medusa, common along the Atlantic coast of the United\r\nStates; it is semi-transparent and lustrous pink.]\r\n\r\nThis has recently (1897) been summed up very clearly by Prof. Arthur P.\r\nCrouch, in an article in “The Nineteenth Century,” from which it will\r\nbe worth while to quote a paragraph or two:\r\n\r\n  The conditions under which they [that is, deep-sea animals] have\r\n  to live in the abysmal areas seem very unfavorable to animal\r\n  existence. The temperature at the bottom of the ocean is nearly\r\n  down to freezing-point, and sometimes actually below it. There is a\r\n  total absence of light, as far as sunlight is concerned, and there\r\n  is an enormous pressure, reckoned at about one ton to the square\r\n  inch in every 1000 fathoms, which is 160 times greater than that of\r\n  the atmosphere we live in. At 2500 fathoms the pressure is thirty\r\n  times more powerful than the steam pressure of a locomotive when\r\n  drawing a train.[7] As late as 1880 a leading zoölogist explained\r\n  the existence of deep-sea animals at such depths by assuming that\r\n  their bodies were composed of solids and liquids of great density,\r\n  and contained no air. This, however, is not the case with deep-sea\r\n  fish, which are provided with air-inflated swimming-bladders. If one\r\n  of these fish, in full chase after its prey, happens to ascend beyond\r\n  a certain level, its bladder becomes distended with the decreased\r\n  pressure, and carries it, in spite of all its efforts, still higher\r\n  in its course. In fact, members of this unfortunate class are liable\r\n  to become victims to the unusual accident of falling upwards, and no\r\n  doubt meet with a violent death soon after leaving their accustomed\r\n  level, and long before their bodies reach the surface....\r\n\r\n  The fauna of the deep sea—with a few exceptions hitherto only known\r\n  as fossils—are new and specially modified forms of families and\r\n  genera inhabiting shallow waters in modern times, and have been\r\n  driven down to the depths of the ocean by their more powerful rivals\r\n  in the battle of life, much as the ancient Britons were compelled\r\n  to withdraw to the barren and inaccessible fastnesses of Wales.\r\n  Some of their organs have undergone considerable modification in\r\n  correspondence to the changed conditions of their new habitats. Thus\r\n  down to 900 fathoms their eyes have generally become enlarged, to\r\n  make the best of the faint light which may possibly penetrate there.\r\n  After 1000 fathoms these organs are either still further enlarged or\r\n  so greatly reduced that in some species they disappear altogether\r\n  and are replaced by enormously long feelers. The only light at great\r\n  depths which would enable large eyes to be of any service is the\r\n  phosphorescence given out by deep-sea animals. We know that at the\r\n  surface this light is often very powerful, and Sir Wyville Thomson\r\n  has recorded one occasion on which the sea at night was “a perfect\r\n  blaze of phosphorescence, so strong that lights and shadows were\r\n  thrown on the sails and it was easy to read the smallest print.” It\r\n  is thought possible by several naturalists that certain portions of\r\n  the sea bottom may be as brilliantly illumined by this sort of light\r\n  as the streets of a European city after sunset.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BOTTLE-FISH AND THE PELICAN-FISH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AT THE BOTTOM OF THE TROPICAL SEA.\r\n\r\nThe large floating object is the phosphorescent, compound, oceanic\r\nhydrozoan _Agalma elegans_, a physophore related to the jellyfishes.\r\nIts tentacles trail over dead corals,—madrepore, brain-corals, etc.;\r\nwhile the living reef beyond is crowned by branching corals, corallines\r\nand seaweeds.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking examples of this vertical distribution, which\r\nforms layers of animal life, as it were, in the ocean from the abysses\r\nto the shallows, is shown by the coral-reefs. The foundations of these\r\npolyp-built barriers or islands are laid by the millions of minute\r\nindividuals of one solid, heavy kind of coral which can flourish only\r\nin pretty deep water. When these have reached their highest growth they\r\ncease to propagate there, and a second kind comes and colonizes upon\r\nthe summit of this massive foundation and carries the work a little\r\nfarther up. Then these die off, and a third kind plants itself upon\r\ntheir remains and carries the structure to the top, near the surface\r\nof the sea, where many surface-corals, corallines, and various other\r\nlimy and flinty plants and animals help to erect a dry reef, upon which\r\nland vegetation can find a root-hold, and where, after a while, men may\r\ndwell. When these coral-built islands are ring-shaped they are called\r\n_atolls_, and are believed to be living crowns about the summits of\r\nsubmerged mountains.\r\n\r\nMen make use of something in nearly every branch of ocean life, from\r\nhumblest to highest. The lowest of all, as I have already said, are the\r\nforaminifers; it is their skeletons which make up our common chalk. A\r\nclose ally of theirs is the sponge, of which a dozen or so varieties\r\nare sold in the shops. Sponges come chiefly from the Mediterranean,\r\nthe Persian and Ceylonese waters of the Indian Ocean, and from the\r\nGulf coast of Florida. In the Old World they are obtained chiefly\r\nby diving. Men who are trained from boyhood to this work go out to\r\nthe sponge-ground in boats on fine days. Fastening a netting-bag\r\nabout their waists, and taking a heavy stone in their hands, they\r\ndive head-foremost to the bottom,—often twelve or fifteen fathoms\r\nbelow,—tear the sponges from the rocks, and rise with a bagful, to\r\nbe dragged almost utterly exhausted into their boat, often fainting\r\nimmediately after. This requires them to hold their breath under\r\nthe water for two minutes or more; but none but the most expert can\r\ndo that, and a diver does not live long. In Florida, however, the\r\nsponge-gatherers do not dive, but go in ships to where the sponges\r\ngrow, and then cruise about in small boats, each of which contains\r\ntwo men: one steers, while the other leans over the side searching\r\nthe bottom. In order to see it plainly, he has what he calls a\r\n“water-glass”—a common wooden pail the bottom of which is glass.\r\nPressing this down into the water a few inches, he thrusts in his face,\r\nand can then perceive everything on the bottom with great distinctness.\r\nWhen he sees a sponge he thrusts down a long, stout pole, on the end of\r\nwhich is a double hook, like a small pitchfork, set at right angles to\r\nthe handle, and drags up the captive.\r\n\r\nThe sponges, having been obtained, must be put through long operations\r\nof rotting, beating, rinsing, drying, and bleaching before their\r\nskeletons—the serviceable part—are fit for use. Only a few, however,\r\nout of the large number of species of sponges have any commercial value.\r\n\r\nThe limy skeletons of the coral polyps form what we term “corals.” The\r\nround white ones and the variously branching ones may come from any\r\none of several parts of the equatorial half of the globe, and are of\r\nvalue chiefly as mantel ornaments. The red coral of which necklaces\r\nand other bits of jewelry are made, especially at Naples, is procured\r\nby divers about the shores of Sicily and Sardinia, and its gathering,\r\ncutting and mounting into ornaments, form a flourishing industry in\r\nsouthern Italy.\r\n\r\nRising in the zoölogical scale to starfishes and sea-urchins, I can\r\nonly say that the starfishes interest oystermen because they prey upon\r\ntheir oysters, and the former often do enormous damage to planted\r\nbeds, especially in Long Island Sound. In the old days it was thought\r\nthat medicines made out of the “stars” and the “sea-eggs” were very\r\npotent in certain diseases. The trepang—some one of several sorts\r\nof holothurian, an elongated creature related to the starfish, and\r\ncovered with a prickly, leathery hide, so that it looks like a sort\r\nof sea-cucumber—which is dried and eaten by the Chinese and Malayans,\r\nbelongs here too; considerable quantities of these queer food-creatures\r\nare gathered by the Chinese along the coasts of Mexico, Southern\r\nCalifornia and the outlying islands, and are sold in San Francisco\r\nmainly for export to Asia. The sea-urchin itself is eagerly sought as\r\nfood by the Indians of the American northwest coast.\r\n\r\nComing to crustaceans—do we not eat crabs gladly, from the “shedder”\r\nto the huge lobster? On the coast of Maine whole villages of sea-side\r\npeople get their support almost wholly by catching lobsters and canning\r\nthem to send abroad. In Virginia and North Carolina, at certain\r\nseasons, hundreds of men are engaged in catching and shipping crabs\r\nfor market, and in Louisiana large factories are devoted to canning\r\nshrimps, which are also extensively used as food in the Old World,\r\nwhere they are cooked by parching or boiling, and sold by peddlers in\r\nthe streets.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the mollusks, in our glance at the useful animals of\r\nthe ocean; and to prove _their_ importance, it is enough to remind the\r\nreader that these include the “shell-fish” of our coasts—the oyster,\r\nclam, mussel, scallop, cockle, and all the rest—not a few!\r\n\r\nI found by my long study of the subject, when, in 1879 and 1880, I\r\nwas gathering statistics of the United States shell-fisheries for the\r\nUnited States Fish Commission and the Tenth Census, that at that time\r\nthere were taken from our waters, of oysters alone, almost 23,000,000\r\nbushels each year, worth to the oystermen about $13,500,000. During the\r\ntwenty years that have elapsed since that investigation—the figures of\r\nwhich you may obtain in full in my Report to the Tenth Census upon the\r\nOyster Industries—these amounts have largely increased.\r\n\r\nThis business employs over 100,000 persons in this country alone; and\r\noysters, clams, and other shell-fish are gathered all round the globe,\r\nforming one of the most important of all natural supplies of food. In\r\nthe most thickly populated parts of the world the natural supply of\r\noysters long ago ceased to suffice for the demand, and artificial\r\npropagation and cultivation were resorted to and now prevail on both\r\nsides of the North Atlantic, and to a less degree elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STARFISHES AT HOME.\r\n\r\nThis is the common eastern American form (_Asterias vulgaris_) upper\r\nand under views.]\r\n\r\nThe Romans, away back in the days of Horace, raised oysters in ponds\r\nalong the Italian coast, and Eastern nations preserved the custom\r\nduring the middle ages, when Europe was doing little except quarreling\r\nand making pretty pictures on parchment. More recently the French of\r\nthe Channel coast took it up, and the English followed, finding that\r\ntheir natural oyster and mussel beds were becoming exhausted. The same\r\nfate has overtaken our oyster-beds everywhere north of the Chesapeake,\r\nand largely there; so that now nearly all the oysters brought to market\r\nare those which have been raised upon private planted beds, which men\r\nown or lease and attend to as they do to estates on shore; indeed, it\r\nis common to speak of such under-water estates as “farms.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEA-SHELLS IN THE SURF.]\r\n\r\nAn oyster-farm may be conducted in two ways. One is to place upon a\r\ncertain space of bottom, in some shallow bay, as many young oysters as\r\nit will conveniently hold. These young oysters, generally hardly bigger\r\nthan your thumb-nail, are dredged in summer from certain reefs in deep\r\nwater, where the oysters are never allowed to grow to full size; and\r\nto a large extent they are brought northward by the ship-load from\r\nMaryland and Virginia, which have more “seed,” as it is called, than\r\nthey need for their own planting. These young oysters, protected from\r\nharm, and having plenty of space to grow, come to a proper size for\r\nmarket in about three years, and are then gathered by their owners and\r\nsold.\r\n\r\nAnother method is to spread old shells, pebbles, etc., on the bottom,\r\nto which the floating eggs emitted by adult oysters in the neighborhood\r\nadhere. The thick “catch” of infant mollusks hatched from these captive\r\neggs is then taken up and respread in a more scattered way upon new\r\nground, and is allowed to grow to maturity. The oysters raised by\r\neither of these methods are of better appearance and taste, as a rule,\r\nthan those that grow naturally, because each has room enough to perfect\r\nits proportions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MELEAGRINA.\r\n\r\n_Meleagrina (Avicula) margaritifera._\r\n\r\n_b._ byssal foramen or notch; _g._ suspensors of the gills.]\r\n\r\nMussels, clams of many varieties, and even sponges and peak-shells, are\r\nalso cultivated to some extent, each according to the plan its natural\r\nhabits make advisable. In this way certain great areas of favorable\r\nocean-bottom have become as valuable as the neighboring shore-land, or\r\neven far more so, if you compare, acre for acre, the yield of the crops\r\nbelow with those above the water-line.\r\n\r\nBut mollusks are useful in many other ways than as human food. As they\r\nare known to be the principal food of several valuable fishes, enormous\r\nquantities are devoted to baiting hooks in both hand-lining and\r\ntrawling for cod and similar commercial species. The quaint squids are\r\nmollusks, and these are especially useful for bait in certain places\r\nand seasons, and are taken in the North Atlantic in vast numbers for\r\nthat purpose.\r\n\r\nThe shells of mollusks are applied to a surprising variety of purposes,\r\nfrom paving roads to making shirt-studs, while their natural beauty\r\nhas suggested their utilization as ornaments in a hundred ways. We\r\ncut them up by the million into buttons and various small objects,\r\nsuch as parasol handles, and polish and fashion them into all sorts\r\nof knickknacks, thus giving employment to thousands of persons. Many\r\nship-loads of shells are brought to New York from the West Indies every\r\nyear for such purposes. I need not dwell upon this, but turn to the\r\ninteresting subject of pearls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CASSIDIDÆ.\r\n\r\nHelmet-shell (_Cassis flammea_).]\r\n\r\nMother-of-pearl is the bright inside surface, or _nacre_, of the large\r\noyster that gives us pearls, which are themselves composed of the same\r\nsubstance formed in a nodule around some intruding substance, like a\r\ngrain of sand, which irritates the mollusk’s skin until it is made\r\nsmooth and comfortable by this iridescent coating.\r\n\r\nBivalves yielding this beautiful substance exist in various parts of\r\nthe world; but in America the only fishery for the pearl-oyster is in\r\nthe Gulf of California, and that is by no means as productive as it\r\nused to be. The season for pearl-fishing on the Pacific coast of Mexico\r\nis from June to December, but the diving can be done only in good\r\nweather, and for about three hours at the time of low water, since the\r\ntide there rises twenty feet, which would make a large dive of itself;\r\nand, besides, the currents are troublesome during high water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCORPION-SHELL.\r\n\r\n(_Pteroceras lambis._)]\r\n\r\nAt the right hour the Mexicans go out in their canoes, one man of\r\nthe four or five in each canoe paddling, while the rest scrutinize\r\nthe bottom. It may be rocky and weed-grown, but the water is clear,\r\nand their practised eyes detect a single round oyster where you or I\r\ncertainly would overlook a dozen of them. Then down a man goes and\r\nbrings up his prize, with perhaps some additional ones. Sixty or eighty\r\nfeet is not too deep for these adventurous divers, who will stay a\r\nwhole minute upon the bottom. No food is eaten by these men on the day\r\nthey dive until their labor has been done.\r\n\r\nWestern Australia is another fruitful field for pearl-oysters, and\r\nuntil a few years ago they were taken there by native blackfellows,\r\ndiving without weights or any other assistance in any water not more\r\nthan ten fathoms deep. The inshore shallows have now been so cleared of\r\nshells that the only profitable industry is to go down in deep water\r\nin diving-dress and make a thorough clean-up of each “patch” where the\r\nshells seem numerous.\r\n\r\nThe divers find it an interesting and curious world where they\r\nwork, but one full of fright and peril. Some men who attempt it are\r\nso unnerved that they will never make a second descent. None can\r\nendure the practice long without ill health resulting; and the native\r\nAustralians will never enter a diver’s dress, declining to go down\r\nwhere it is too deep to dive naked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MITER-SHELLS.\r\n\r\n_a._ _Mitra vulpecula._ _b._ _Mitra episcopalis._]\r\n\r\nAs for the dangers, drowning by some accident to the apparatus, or\r\nthrough the stupidity of the boatmen above, is only one of them. The\r\nwarm waters in which these men work are the home of the largest and\r\nmost deadly sharks, and of various other submarine creatures one would\r\nrather not meet in their own element. Of them all the sharks are most\r\nto be dreaded, especially by the naked men. As a rule, however, they\r\nare easily frightened away, or can be avoided by the clever swimmer,\r\nwho quickly stirs up the mud of the bottom, and rises in the fog before\r\nthe dull shark discovers that he has gone. East Indians are said to\r\nfight sharks quite fearlessly, stabbing them with a knife as they roll\r\nover preparatory to a close attack. I have read a story to the effect\r\nthat formerly the Mexican Indian divers on our western coast used\r\nto take down with them a stick of hard wood about two feet long and\r\nsharpened at both ends. When a shark was encountered from which they\r\ncould not readily escape, they would snatch this weapon from their\r\nbelts, grasp it in the middle, and thrust it dexterously crosswise\r\ninto the widely distended mouth of the monster, opened to seize them.\r\nTo shut down his jaws upon such a skewer would undoubtedly discomfit\r\na shark or anything else; but when one thinks of the time, nerve, and\r\nsure aim it would require to accomplish this feat, he begins to doubt\r\nwhether it really ever was tried. I advise you, therefore, to prove the\r\nstory better than I have been able to do, before you pin _all_ your\r\nfaith to it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VENUS’ COMB, ONE OF THE MURICES OF CHINA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MUREX (“MUREX PALMA-ROSÆ”) OF CEYLON.]\r\n\r\nAn Australian pearl-diver, writing about this matter in “The Century”\r\nmagazine a few years ago, assures us that a fifteen-foot shark,\r\nmagnified by the water, and making a bee-line for one, is sufficient to\r\nmake the stoutest heart quake, in spite of the assertion that sharks\r\nhave never been known to attack a man in a rubber diving-dress. He adds:\r\n\r\n  Neither is the sight of a large turtle comforting when one does\r\n  not know exactly what it is, and the coiling of a sea-snake around\r\n  one’s legs, although it has only one’s hands to bite at, is, to say\r\n  the least, unpleasant. A little fish called the stone-fish is one\r\n  of the enemies of the diver. It seems to make its habitation under\r\n  the pearl-shell, as it is only when picking up a shell that any one\r\n  has been known to be bitten. I remember well the first time I was\r\n  bitten by this spiteful member of the finny tribe. I dropped my bag\r\n  of shells, and hastened to the surface; but in this short space of\r\n  time my hand and arm had so swollen that it was with difficulty I\r\n  could get the dress off, and then was unable to work for three days,\r\n  suffering intense pain the while. Afterward I learned that staying\r\n  down a couple of hours after a bite will stop any further discomfort,\r\n  the pressure of water causing much bleeding at the bitten part, and\r\n  thus expelling the poison.\r\n\r\nAll the oysters when brought ashore are opened in vats of water, and\r\ncarefully examined for the pearls they may contain half embedded in\r\ntheir mantles; but very few reward the diver with gems worth selling\r\nseparately or otherwise than by weight as “seed” pearls. Many divers,\r\ntherefore, do not themselves take the trouble of opening what they\r\ncatch, but sell them unopened at a few cents a dozen, preferring the\r\nsmall and steady assured income to the chances of failure or a fortune.\r\n\r\nThe round, flat, beautiful shells are saved, and their sale\r\n(for mother-of-pearl work) brings nearly as much money into the\r\npearl-fishing communities in the course of a season as is derived from\r\nthe pearls themselves.\r\n\r\nWhat beauty, as well as usefulness, have shells! And how wide is the\r\nscience (conchology) that deals with them, and tells us not only their\r\nstructure and manner of life, but interprets the part which their\r\nextraordinary forms, ornaments, colors, and appendages play in their\r\n“struggle for existence” down in that populous green under-world of the\r\nwaters!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON THE GULF STREAM SLOPE, FROM ONE TO TWO MILES BELOW\r\nTHE SURFACE.]\r\n\r\n  I know a picturesque old house [writes a charming pen in one of\r\n  the early volumes of “Scribner’s Monthly”] that has a many-shelved\r\n  pantry devoted to the exhibition and sale of shells, collected in\r\n  many a long voyage to the remotest parts of the five oceans. Apart\r\n  from their scientific interest, their associations with alien races\r\n  and far-off countries, how beautiful these shells are in themselves!\r\n  and how readily might the prevailing vulgarities and absurdities in\r\n  the decoration of glass and porcelain be corrected by studying the\r\n  ceramics of nature! How, for instance, is our sense of cleanliness\r\n  served and our appetite wooed by the extreme smoothness, hardness\r\n  of surface, and pearly white of the oyster-shell! What decoration in\r\n  the part that receives the viand, what metallizing the surface or\r\n  changing it into artificial marble, or covering it up with pictures,\r\n  would take the place of the pure, colorless shell?\r\n\r\n  Every species of these shells has a principle of growth, or law of\r\n  form, peculiar to itself and yet based upon some more general law of\r\n  form common to other species.... In the comb of Venus, for instance,\r\n  the initial impulse of structure tends to produce a series of spines\r\n  of a peculiar curvature, and arranged after a certain order that\r\n  involves the use of similar curves. It is interesting to study the\r\n  development of this simple principle into the complex and singular\r\n  form of beauty comprised in the shell itself, the idea being carried\r\n  into the most minute particulars—even the dark markings at the mouth\r\n  being shaped like spines, and every small projection on the surface\r\n  evidently being an arrested development of spines. In the _Murex\r\n  haustellum_, on the contrary, nodules take the place of spines. In\r\n  the _M. endivia_ an entirely different idea is developed. Notice the\r\n  cross-striations. Instead of prolonging themselves into cylindrically\r\n  pointed spines, as in the case of the Venus’ comb, or bunching\r\n  themselves into knobs, as in the _M. haustellum_, they expand into\r\n  wonderful foliated projections, the edges of which are beautifully\r\n  fluted, like the leaves of the lettuce. Another fine effect is\r\n  afforded by the different texture of the inside and outside surfaces,\r\n  down to the smallest foliation, the inner parts exhibiting a polished\r\n  pearly white, and the outside a gray and wrinkled skin. Observe that,\r\n  however rough or dull of hue the outside of a shell, its lips are\r\n  always pure and often flushed with lovely color; for, as a rule (and\r\n  here is another hint to decorators), Nature distinguishes by some\r\n  adornment the most significant parts of her creatures, where life and\r\n  use are centered.... The ocean, indeed, beautifies all it touches.\r\n  Give it any rough shard, and it will so roll it about, and lick it\r\n  with its waves, and smooth it with their soft attrition, that it will\r\n  return you a polished and shapely nodule, exhibiting all the beauty\r\n  of color and surface of which the material is capable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: molluscs and plants]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[7] It does not follow that these creatures are conscious of this\r\npressure, any more than we are of the pressure upon us of the fourteen\r\npounds to the square inch of our atmosphere. The point is that they\r\n_do_ feel it when they rise upward to a point where the pressure is\r\ndistinctly less, just as we are conscious of a difference when we\r\nascend in a balloon or climb a very high mountain, and after a time\r\nwe find that we cannot go any farther. Land animals therefore have a\r\nvertical limit to their distribution as well as sea animals, and for\r\nanalogous reasons.—E.
