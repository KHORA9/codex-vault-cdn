The keynote of the course may be found in\r\nthe dominant characteristics of the different earth features and the\r\ngeological processes which have been betrayed in the shaping of them.\r\nSuch a geological examination of landscape is replete with fascinating\r\nrevelations, and it lends to the study of Nature a deep meaning which\r\ncannot but enhance the enjoyment of her varied aspects.\r\n\r\nThat there is a real place for such a cultural study of geology within\r\nthe University is believed to be shown by the increasing number of\r\nstudents who have elected the work. Even more than in former years the\r\nAmerican travels afar by car or steamship, and the earth’s surface\r\nfeatures in all their manifold diversity are thus one after the other\r\nunrolled before him. The thousands who each year cross the Atlantic\r\nto roam over European countries may by historical, literary, or\r\nartistic studies prepare themselves to derive an exquisite pleasure\r\nas they visit places identified with past achievement of one form or\r\nanother. Yet the Channel coast, the gorge of the Rhine, the glaciers of\r\nSwitzerland, and the wild scenery of Norway or Scotland have each their\r\nfascinating story to tell of a history far more remote and varied. To\r\nread this history, the runic characters in which it is written must\r\nfirst of all be mastered; for in every landscape there are strong\r\nindividual lines of character such as the pen artist would skillfully\r\nextract for an outline sketch. Such _character profiles_ are often many\r\ntimes repeated in each landscape, and in them we have a key to the\r\nhistorical record.\r\n\r\nAn object of the present readings has thus been to enable the\r\nstudent to himself pick out in each landscape these more significant\r\nlines and so read directly from Nature. In the landscapes which\r\nhave been represented, the aim has been to draw as far as possible\r\nupon localities well known to travelers and likely to be visited,\r\neither because of their historical interest or their purely scenic\r\nattractions. It should thus be possible for a tourist in America or\r\nEurope to pursue his landscape studies whenever he sets out upon his\r\ntravels. The better to aid him in this endeavor, some suggestions\r\nconcerning the itinerary of journeys have been supplied in an appendix.\r\n\r\nRegarded as a textbook of geology, the present work offers some\r\ndepartures from existing examples. Though it has been customary to\r\ncombine in a single text historical with dynamical and structural\r\ngeology, a tendency has already become apparent to treat the historical\r\ndivision apart from the others. Again, a desire to treat the science\r\nof geology comprehensively has led some authors into including so\r\nmany subjects as to render their texts unnecessarily encyclopedic\r\nand correspondingly uninteresting to the general reader. It is the\r\nauthor’s belief that there is a real need for a book which may be read\r\nintelligently by the general public, and it must be recognized that\r\nthe beginner in the subject cannot cover the entire field by a single\r\ncourse of readings. The present work has, therefore, been prepared with\r\na view to selecting for study those dominant geological processes which\r\nare best illustrated by features in northern North America and Europe.\r\nIt is this desire to illustrate the readings by travels afield, which\r\naccounts for the prominence given to the subject of glaciation; for the\r\nlarger number of colleges and universities in both America and Europe\r\nare surrounded by the heavy accumulations that have resulted from\r\nformer glaciations.\r\n\r\nEmphasis has also been placed upon the dependence of the dominant\r\ngeological processes of any region upon existing climatic conditions,\r\na fact to which too little attention has generally been given. This\r\nexplains the rather full treatment of desert regions, of which,\r\nin our own country particularly, much may be illustrated upon the\r\ntranscontinental railway journeys.\r\n\r\nMore than in most texts the attempt has here been made to teach\r\ndirectly through the eye with the efficient aid of apt illustrations\r\nintimately interwoven with the text. For such success as has been\r\nreached in this endeavor, the author is greatly indebted to two\r\nstudents of the University of Michigan,—Mr. James H. Meier, who has\r\nprepared the line drawings of landscapes, and Mr. Hugh M. Pierce, who\r\nhas draughted the diagrams. Though credit has in most cases been given\r\nwhere illustrations have been made from another’s photographs, yet\r\nespecial mention should here be made of the debt to Dr. H. W. Fairbanks\r\nof Berkeley, California, whose beautiful and instructive photographs\r\nare reproduced upon many a page.\r\n\r\nAs given at the University of Michigan, the lectures reflected in the\r\npresent volume are supplemented by excursions and by so much laboratory\r\npractice as is necessary to become familiar with the more common\r\nminerals and rocks, and to read intelligently the usual topographical\r\nand geological maps. In the appendices the means for carrying out such\r\nstudies, in part with newly devised apparatus, have been indicated.\r\n\r\nThe scope of the book precludes the possibility of furnishing the\r\nreader with the sources for the body of fact and theory which is\r\npresented, although much may be inferred from the names which appear\r\nbeneath the illustrations, and more definite knowledge will be found in\r\nthe references to literature supplied at the ends of chapters. A large\r\namount of original and unpublished material is for a similar reason\r\nunlabeled, and it has been left for the professional geologist to\r\ndetect these new strands which have been drawn into the web.\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM HERBERT HOBBS.\r\n\r\n  ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN,\r\n  October 25, 1911.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n  THE COMPILATION OF EARTH HISTORY\r\n\r\n

The pages of the record are the layers of rock which make\r\nup the outer shell of our world. Here as in old manuscripts pages are\r\nsometimes found to be missing, and on others the writing is largely\r\neffaced so as to be indistinct or even illegible. An intelligent\r\ninterpretation of this record requires a knowledge of the materials\r\nand the structure of the earth, as well as a proper conception of the\r\nagencies which have caused change and so developed the history. These\r\nagencies in operation are physical and chemical processes, and so the\r\nsciences of physics and chemistry are fundamental in any extended study\r\nof geology. Not only is geology, so to speak, founded upon chemistry\r\nand physics, but its field overlaps that of many other important\r\nsciences. The earliest earth history has to do with the form, size, and\r\nphysical condition of a minor planet in the solar system. The earliest\r\nportion of the story belongs therefore to astronomy, and no sharp line\r\ncan be drawn to separate this chapter from those later ones which are\r\nmore clearly within the domain of geology.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Subdivisions of geology.=—The terms “cosmic geology” and “astronomic\r\ngeology” have sometimes been used to cover the astronomy of the earth\r\nplanet. The later earth history develops, among other things, the\r\nvaried forms of animal and vegetable life which have had a definite\r\norder of appearance. Their study is to a large extent zoölogy and\r\nbotany, though here considered from an essentially different viewpoint.\r\nThis subdivision of our science is called paleontological geology or\r\npaleontology, which in common usage includes the plant as well as the\r\nanimal world, or what is sometimes called paleobotany. In order to fix\r\nthe order of events in geological history, these biological studies\r\nare necessary, for the pages of the record have many of them been\r\nmisplaced as a result of the vicissitudes of earth history, and the\r\nremains of life in the rock layers supply a pagination from which it is\r\npossible to correctly rearrange the misplaced pages. As compiled into a\r\nconsecutive history of the earth since life appeared upon it, we have\r\nthe division of historical geology; though this differs but little from\r\nstratigraphical geology, the emphasis in the case of the former being\r\nplaced on the history itself and in the latter upon the arrangement of\r\nevents—the pagination of the record.\r\n\r\nSo far as they are known to us, the materials of which the earth is\r\ncomposed are minerals grouped into various characteristic aggregates\r\nknown as rocks. Here the science is founded upon mineralogy as well as\r\nchemistry, and a study of the rock materials of the earth is designated\r\npetrographical geology or petrography. The various rocks which enter\r\ninto the composition of the earth’s outer shell—the only portion known\r\nto us from direct observation—are built into it in an architecture\r\nwhich, when carefully studied, discloses important events in the\r\nearth’s history. The division of the science which is concerned with\r\nearth architecture is geotectonic or structural geology.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The study of earth features and their significance.=—The features\r\nupon the surface of the earth have all their deep significance, and\r\nif properly understood, a flood of light is thrown, not only upon\r\npresent conditions, but upon many chapters of the earth’s earlier\r\nhistory. Here the relation of our study to topography and geography is\r\nvery close, so that the lines of separation are but ill defined. The\r\nterms “physiographical geology”, “physiography”, and “geomorphology”\r\nare concerned with the configuration of the earth’s surface—its\r\nphysiognomy—and with the genesis of its individual surface features.\r\nIt is this genetical side of physiography which separates it from\r\ntopography and lends it an absorbing interest, though it causes it\r\nto largely overlap the division of dynamical geology or the study of\r\ngeological processes. In fact, the difference between dynamical geology\r\nand physiography is largely one of emphasis, the stress being laid\r\nupon the processes in the former and upon the resultant features in the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nUnder dynamical geology are included important subdivisions, such\r\nas seismic geology, or the study of earthquakes, and vulcanology,\r\nor the study of volcanoes. Another large subject, glacial geology,\r\nbelongs within the broad frontier common to both dynamical geology\r\nand physiography. A relatively new subdivision of geological science\r\nis orientational geology, which is concerned with the trend of earth\r\nfeatures, and is closely related both to physiography and to dynamical\r\nand structural geology.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tabular recapitulation.=—In a slightly different arrangement from the\r\nabove order of mention, the subdivisions of geology are as follows:—\r\n\r\n_Subdivisions of Geology_\r\n\r\n  _Petrographical Geology._              Materials of the earth.\r\n  _Geotectonic Geology._                 Architecture of the earth’s\r\n                                            outer shell.\r\n  _Dynamical Geology._                   Earth processes.\r\n    Seismic Geology—earthquakes.\r\n      Vulcanology—volcanoes. Glacial\r\n      Geology—glaciers, etc.\r\n\r\n  _Physiographical Geology._             Earth physiognomy and its\r\n                                           genesis.\r\n\r\n  _Orientational Geology._               The arrangement and the trend\r\n                                           of earth features.\r\n\r\nIn one way or another all of the above subdivisions of geology are in\r\nsome way concerned in the genesis of earth physiognomy, and they must\r\ntherefore be given consideration in a work which is devoted to a study\r\nof the meaning of earth features. The compiled record of the rocks is,\r\nhowever, something quite apart and without pertinence to the present\r\nwork. As already indicated its subdivisions are:—\r\n\r\n  _Astronomic Geology._          Planetary history of the earth.\r\n  _Statigraphic Geology._        The pagination of earth records.\r\n  _Historical Geology._          The compiled record and its\r\n                                   interpretation.\r\n  _Paleontological Geology._     The evolution of life upon the earth.\r\n\r\nIn every attempt at systematic arrangement difficulties are\r\nencountered, usually because no one consideration can be used\r\nthroughout as the basis of classification. Such terms as “economic\r\ngeology” and “mining geology” have either a pedagogical or a commercial\r\nsignificance, and so would hardly fit into the system which we have\r\noutlined.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Geological processes not universal.=—It is inevitable that the\r\ngeology of regions which are easily accessible for study should\r\nhave absorbed the larger measure of attention; but it should not be\r\nforgotten that geology is concerned with the history of the entire\r\nworld, and that perspective will be lost and erroneous conclusions\r\ndrawn if local conditions are kept too often before the eyes. To\r\nillustrate by a single instance, the best studied regions of the globe\r\nare those in which fairly abundant precipitation in the form of rain\r\nhas fitted the land for easy conditions of life, and has thus permitted\r\nthe development of a high civilization. In degree, and to some extent\r\nalso in kind, geologic processes are markedly different within those\r\nwidely extended regions which, because either arid or cold, have been\r\nbut ill fitted for human habitation. Yet in the historical development\r\nof the earth, those geologic processes which obtain in desert or\r\npolar regions are none the less important because less often and less\r\ncarefully observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Change, and not stability, the order of nature.=—Man is ever prone to\r\nemphasize the importance of apparent facts to the disadvantage of those\r\nless clearly revealed though equally potent. The ancient notion of the\r\n_terra firma_, the safe and solid ground, arose because of its contrast\r\nwith the far more mobile bodies of water; but this illusion is quickly\r\ndispelled with the sudden quaking of the ground. Experience has clearly\r\nshown that, both upon and beneath the earth’s surface, chemical and\r\nphysical changes are going on, subject to but little interruption. “The\r\nhills rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun” is a poetical metaphor; for\r\nthe Himalayas, the loftiest mountains upon the globe, were, to speak\r\nin geological terms, raised from the sea but yesterday. Even to-day\r\nthey are pushing up their heads, only to be relentlessly planed down\r\nthrough the action of the atmosphere, of ice, and of running water.\r\nEven more than has generally been supposed, the earth suffers change.\r\nOften within the space of a few seconds, to the accompaniment of a\r\nheavy earthquake, many square miles of territory are bodily uplifted,\r\nwhile neighboring areas may be relatively depressed. Thus change, and\r\nnot stability, is the order of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Observational geology _versus_ speculative philosophy.=—There appears\r\nto be a more or less prevalent notion that the views which are held\r\nby scientists in one generation are abandoned by those of the next;\r\nand this is apt to lead to the belief that little is really known and\r\nthat much is largely guessed. Some ground there undoubtedly is for\r\nsuch skepticism, though much of it may be accounted for by a general\r\nfailure among scientists, as well as others, to clearly differentiate\r\nthat which is essentially speculative from what is based broadly upon\r\nobserved facts. Even with extended observation, the possibility of\r\nexplaining the facts in more than one way is not excluded; but the\r\nline is nevertheless a broad one which separates this entire field\r\nof observation from what is essentially speculative philosophy. To\r\nillustrate: the mechanics of the action which goes on within volcanic\r\ncraters is now fairly well understood as a result of many and extended\r\nobservations, and it is little likely that future generations of\r\ngeologists will discredit the main conclusions which have been reached.\r\nThe cause of the rise of the lava to the earth’s surface is, on the\r\nother hand, much less clearly demonstrated, and the views which are\r\nheld express rather the differing opinions than any clear deductions\r\nfrom observation. Again, and similarly, the physical history of the\r\ngreat continental glaciers of the so-called “ice age” is far more\r\nthoroughly known than that of any existing glacier of the same type;\r\nbut the cause of the climatic changes which brought on the glaciation\r\nis still largely a matter for speculation.\r\n\r\nIn the present work, the attempt will be, so far as possible, to give\r\nan exposition of geologic processes and the earth features which result\r\nfrom them, with hints only at those ultimate causes which lie hidden in\r\nthe background.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The scientific attitude and temper.=—The student of science should\r\nmake it his aim, not only clearly to separate in his studies the\r\nproximate from the ultimate causes of observed phenomena, but he should\r\nkeep his mind always open for reaching individual conclusions. No\r\ndoctrines should be accepted finally upon faith merely, but subject\r\nrather to his own reasoning processes. This should not be interpreted\r\nto mean that concerning matters of which he knows little or nothing\r\nhe should not pay respect to the recognized authorities; but his\r\nacceptance of any theory should be subject to review so soon as his\r\nown horizon has been sufficiently enlarged. False theories could hardly\r\nhave endured so long in the past, had not too great respect been given\r\nto authorities, and individual reasoning processes been held too long\r\nin subjection.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The value of the hypothesis.=—Because all the facts necessary for a\r\nfull interpretation of observed phenomena are not at one’s hand, this\r\nshould not be made to stand in the way of provisional explanations. If\r\nscience is to advance, the use of hypothesis is absolutely essential;\r\nbut the particular hypothesis adopted should be regarded as temporary\r\nand as indicating a line of observation or of experimentation which\r\nis to be followed in testing it. Thus regarded with an open mind,\r\ninadequate hypotheses are eventually found to be untenable, whereas\r\ncorrect explanations of the facts by the same process are confirmed.\r\nMost hypotheses of science are but partially correct, for we now “see\r\nthrough a glass darkly”; but even so, if properly tested, the false\r\nelements in the hypothesis are one after the other eliminated as the\r\nembodied truth is confirmed and enlarged. Thus “working hypothesis”\r\npasses into theory and becomes an integral part of science.\r\n\r\n\r\n READING REFERENCES FOR CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n The most comprehensive of general geological texts written in English\r\n is Chamberlin and Salisbury’s “Geology” in three volumes (Henry Holt,\r\n 1904-1906), the first volume of which is devoted exclusively to\r\n geological processes and their results.

The relatively unknown central portion,\r\nor “core”, is sometimes referred to as the centrosphere. Inclosing the\r\nlithosphere is a water envelope, the _hydrosphere_, which comprises\r\nthe oceans and inland bodies of water, and has a mass 1/4540 that of\r\nthe lithosphere. If uniformly distributed, the hydrosphere would cover\r\nthe lithosphere to the depth of about two miles, instead of being\r\ncollected in basins as it now is. Though apparently not continuous, if\r\nwe take into account the zone of underground water upon the continents,\r\nthe hydrosphere may properly be considered as a continuous film about\r\nthe lithosphere. It is a fact of much significance that all the ocean\r\nbasins are connected, so that the levels are adjusted to furnish a\r\ncommon record of deposits over the entire surface that is sea-covered.\r\n\r\nEnveloping the hydrosphere is the gaseous envelope, the _atmosphere_,\r\nwith a mass 1/1200000 that of the lithosphere. The atmosphere is a\r\nmixture of the gases oxygen and nitrogen in parts by volume of one of\r\nthe former to four of the latter, with a relatively small percentage\r\nof carbon dioxide. Locally, and at special seasons, the atmosphere\r\nmay be charged with relatively large percentages of water vapor; and\r\nwe shall see that both the carbon dioxide and the vapor contents are\r\nof the utmost importance in geological processes and in the influence\r\nupon climate. Unlike the water which composes the hydrosphere, the\r\ngases of the atmosphere are compressible. Forced down by the weight of\r\nsuperincumbent gas, the layers of the atmosphere at the level of the\r\nsea sustain a pressure of about fifteen pounds to the square inch; but\r\nthis pressure steadily decreases in ascending to higher levels. From\r\ndirect instrumental observation, the air has now been investigated to\r\na height of more than twelve miles from the earth’s surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The evolution of ideas concerning the earth’s figure.=—The ideas\r\nwhich in all ages have been promulgated concerning the figure of the\r\nearth have been many and varied. Though among them are not wanting the\r\npurely speculative and fantastic, it will be interesting to pass in\r\nreview such theories as have grown directly out of observation.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Hebrews and the Babylonians were dwellers of the desert,\r\nand in the mountains which bounded their horizon they saw the confines\r\nof the earth. Pushing at last westward beyond the mountains, they\r\nfound the Mediterranean, and thus arrived at the view that the earth\r\nwas a disk with a rim of mountains which was floated upon water. The\r\nrare but violent rainfalls to which they were accustomed—the desert\r\ncloudburst—further led them to the belief that the mountain rim was\r\ncontinued upward in a dome or firmament of transparent crystal upon\r\nwhich the heavenly bodies were hung and from which out of “windows\r\nof heaven” the water “which is above the earth” was poured out upon\r\nthe earth’s surface. Fantastic as this theory may seem to-day, it\r\nwas founded upon observation, and it well illustrates the dangers of\r\nreasoning from observation within too limited a field.\r\n\r\nAs soon as men began to sail the sea, it was noticed that the water\r\nsurface is convex, for the masts of ships were found to remain\r\nvisible long after their hulls had disappeared below the horizon. It\r\nis difficult to say how soon the idea of the earth’s rotundity was\r\nacquired, but it is certainly of great antiquity. The Dominican monk\r\nVincentius of Beauvais, in a work completed in 1244, declared that the\r\nsurfaces of the earth and the sea were both spherical. The poet Dante\r\nmade it clear that these surfaces were one, and in his famous address\r\nupon “The Water and the Land”, which was delivered in Verona on the\r\n20th of January, 1320, he added a statement that the continents rise\r\nhigher than the ocean. His explanation of this was that the continents\r\nare pulled up by the attraction of the fixed stars after the manner\r\nof attraction of magnets, thus giving an early hint of the force of\r\ngravitation.\r\n\r\nThe earth’s rotundity may be said to have been first proven when\r\nMagellan’s ships in 1521 had accomplished the circumnavigation of\r\nthe globe. Circumnavigation, soon after again carried out by Sir\r\nFrancis Drake, proved that the earth is a closed body bounded by\r\ncurving surfaces in part enveloped by the oceans and everywhere by the\r\natmosphere. The great discovery of Copernicus in 1530 that the earth,\r\nlike Venus, Mars, and the other planets, revolves about the sun as a\r\npart of a system, left little room for doubt that the figure of the\r\nearth was essentially that of a sphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The oblateness of the earth.=—Every schoolboy is to-day familiar with\r\nthe fact that the earth departs from a perfect spherical figure by\r\nbeing flattened at the ends of its axis of rotation. The polar diameter\r\nis usually given as 1/299 shorter than the equatorial one. This\r\noblateness of the spheroid was proven by geodesists when they came to\r\ncompare the lengths of measured degrees of arc upon meridians in high\r\nand in low latitudes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 1.—Diagrams to afford a correct impression of the measure of the\r\ninequalities upon the earth’s surface compared to the earth’s radius.\r\nThe shell represented in _b_ is 1/100 of the earth’s radius, and in _a_\r\nthis zone is magnified for comparison with surface inequalities.]\r\n\r\nThe oblateness of the geoid is well understood from accepted hypotheses\r\nto be the result of the once more rapid rotation of the planet when its\r\nmaterials were more plastic, and hence more responsive to deformation.\r\nAn elastic hoop rotating rapidly about an axis in its plane appears to\r\nthe eye as a solid, and becomes flattened at the ends of its axis in\r\nproportion as the velocity of rotation is increased. Like the earth,\r\nthe other planets in the solar system are similarly oblate and by\r\namounts dependent on the relative velocities of rotation.\r\n\r\nThe departure of the geoid from the spherical surface, owing to its\r\noblateness, is so small that in the figures which we shall use for\r\nillustration it would be less than the thickness of a line. Since it\r\nis well recognized and not important in our present consideration, we\r\nshall for the time being speak of the figure of the earth in terms of\r\ndepartures from a standard spherical surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The arrangement of oceans and continents.=—There are other departures\r\nfrom a spherical surface than the oblateness just referred to,\r\nand these departures, while not large, are believed to be full of\r\nsignificance. Lest the reader should gain a wrong impression of their\r\nmagnitude, it may be well to introduce a diagram drawn to scale and\r\nrepresenting prominent elevations and depressions of the earth (Fig. 1).\r\n\r\nWrong impressions concerning the figure of the lithosphere are\r\nsometimes gained because its depressions are obliterated by the oceans.\r\nThe oceans are, indeed, useful to us in showing where the depressions\r\nare located, but the figure of the earth which we are considering\r\nis the naked surface of the rock. In a broad way, the earth’s shape\r\nwill be given by the arrangement of the oceans and the continents. As\r\nsoon as we take up the study of this arrangement, we find that quite\r\nsignificant facts of distribution are disclosed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 2.—Map on Mercator’s projection to show the reciprocal relation\r\nof the land and sea areas (after Gregory and Arldt).]\r\n\r\nOne of the most significant facts involved in the distribution\r\nof land and sea, is a concentration of the land areas within the\r\nnorthern and the seas within the southern hemisphere. The noteworthy\r\nexception is the occurrence of the great and high Antarctic continent\r\ncentered near the earth’s south pole; and there are extensions of the\r\nnorthern continent as narrowing land masses to the southward of the\r\nequator. Hardly less significant than the existence of land and water\r\nhemispheres is the reciprocal or antipodal distribution of land and sea\r\n(Fig. 2). A third fact of significance is a dovetailing together of sea\r\nand land along an east-and-west direction. While the seas are generally\r\nA-shaped and narrow northward, the land masses are V-shaped and narrow\r\nsouthward, _but this occurs mainly in the southern hemisphere_. Lastly,\r\nthere is some indication of a belt of sea dividing the land masses\r\ninto northern and southern portions along the course of a great circle\r\nwhich makes a small angle with the earth’s equator. Thus the western\r\ncontinent is nearly divided by a mediterranean sea,—the Caribbean,—and\r\nthe eastern is in part so divided by the separation of Europe from\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 3.—The form toward which the figure of the earth is tending, a\r\ntetrahedron with symmetrically truncated angles.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The figure toward which the earth is tending.=—Thus far in our\r\ndiscussion of the earth’s figure we have been guided entirely by the\r\npresent distribution of land and water. There are, however, depressions\r\nupon the surface of the land, in some cases extending below the level\r\nof the sea, which are not to-day occupied by water. By far the most\r\nnotable of these is the great Caspian Depression, which with its\r\nextension divides central and eastern Asia upon the east from Africa\r\nand Europe upon the west. This depression was quite recently occupied\r\nby the sea, and when added to the present ocean basins to indicate\r\ndepressions of the lithosphere, it shows that the earth’s figure\r\ndeparts from the standard spheroid _in the direction_ of the form\r\nrepresented in Fig. 3. This form approximates to a tetrahedron, a\r\nfigure bounded by four equal triangular faces, here with symmetrically\r\ntruncated angles. Of all regular figures with plane surfaces the\r\ntetrahedron has the smallest volume for a given surface, and it\r\npresents moreover a reciprocal relation of projection to depression.\r\nEvery line passing through its center thus finds the surface nearer\r\nthan the average distance upon one side and correspondingly farther\r\nupon the other (Fig. 4).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Astronomical _versus_ geodetic observations.=—Confirmation of the\r\nconclusions arrived at from the arrangement of oceans and continents\r\nhas been secured in other fields. It was pointed out that the earth’s\r\noblateness was proven by comparison of the measured degrees of latitude\r\nupon the earth’s surface in lower and higher latitudes, the degree\r\nbeing found longer as the pole is approached. Any variation from the\r\nspherical surface must obviously increase the size of the measured\r\ndegree of latitude in proportion to the departure from the standard\r\nform, and so the tetrahedral figure with one of its angles at the\r\nsouth pole will require that the degrees of latitude be longer in the\r\nsouthern than they are in the northern hemisphere. This has been found\r\nby measurement to be the case, and the result is further confirmed\r\nby pendulum studies upon the distribution of the earth’s attraction\r\nor gravity. If less of the mass of the earth is concentrated in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, its attraction as measured in vibrations of the\r\npendulum should be correspondingly smaller.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 4.—A truncated tetrahedron, showing how the depression upon one\r\nside of the center is balanced by the opposite projection.]\r\n\r\nOther confirmations of the tetrahedral figure of the earth have been\r\nderived from a comparison of astronomical data, which assume the earth\r\nto be a perfect spheroid, with geodetic measurements, which are based\r\nupon direct measurements. Thus the arc measured in an east-and-west\r\ndirection across Europe revealed a different curvature near the angle\r\nof the tetrahedral figure from what was found farther to the eastward.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Changes of figure during contraction of a spherical body.=—If\r\nwe inquire why the earth in cooling should tend to approach the\r\ntetrahedral figure, an answer is easily found. When formed, the earth\r\nappears to have been a but slightly oblate spheroid, or practically\r\na sphere—the shape which of all incloses the most space for a given\r\nsurface. Cooled and solidified at the surface to the temperature of\r\nthe surrounding air, and the core still hot and continuing to lose\r\nheat, the core must continue to contract though the outer shell is\r\nno longer able to do so. The superficial area being thus maintained\r\nconstant while the volume continues to diminish, the figure must change\r\nfrom the initial one of greatest bulk to others of smaller volume,\r\nand ultimately, if the process should continue indefinitely, to the\r\ntetrahedron, which of all regular figures has the minimum volume for a\r\ngiven surface.\r\n\r\nThat a contracting sphere does indeed pass through such a series of\r\nchanges has been shown by the behavior of contracting soap bubbles and\r\nof rubber balloons, as well as by experiments upon the exhaustion of\r\nair contained in hollow metal spheres of only moderate strength. In\r\nall these instances, the ultimate form produced indicates an indenting\r\nof four sides of the sphere which have the positions of the faces\r\nof a tetrahedron. The late Professor Prinz of Brussels secured some\r\nextremely interesting results in which he obtained intermediate forms\r\nwith six angles, but unfortunately these studies were not prepared for\r\npublication at the time of his death.\r\n\r\nThe earth’s departure from the spheroid in the direction of the\r\nmodified tetrahedron is, as we have seen, no hypothesis, but observed\r\nfact revealed in (1) the concentration of the land about a central\r\nocean in the northern hemisphere; in (2) the antipodal relation of the\r\nland to the water areas, and in (3) the threefold subdivision of the\r\nsurface into north and south belts by the two greater oceans and the\r\nCaspian Depression.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The earlier figures of the earth.=—The manner in which continent and\r\nocean are dovetailed into each other in an east-and-west direction\r\nhas been generally adduced as additional evidence for the tetrahedral\r\nfigure as above described. Closer examination shows that instead of\r\nbeing in harmony with this figure, it indicates a departure from it,\r\nand, as we shall see, a significant departure which undoubtedly has its\r\norigin in the earlier history of the planet. The mediterranean seas of\r\nboth the eastern and the western hemispheres likewise interfere with\r\nthe perfection of the tetrahedral figure and require an explanation.\r\n\r\nLet us then examine in outline the past history of the world with\r\nreference especially to the evolution of the continents and to the\r\ntimes and the manners of surface change. It is now well known that\r\nthere have been three major periods of great deformation of the earth’s\r\nshell. The first of these of which we have record came at the end of\r\nthe first great era of geologic history, the so-called Eozoic era;\r\na second great transformation came at the close of the second or\r\nPaleozoic era; and a third began at the end of the next or Mesozoic\r\nera, an adjustment which is apparently continuing to-day. Each of\r\nthese great surface deformations was accompanied by great volcanic\r\neruptions of which we have the evidence in the lavas remaining for our\r\ninspection, and each was followed by the formation of great glaciers\r\nwhich spread over large areas of the existing continents.\r\n\r\nBefore the earliest of these great changes, the earth appears to have\r\napproximated in its figure somewhat closely to the ideal spheroid, for\r\nit was everywhere enveloped in the hydrosphere as a universal ocean.\r\nToward the close of this period came the adjustments which brought\r\nthe lithosphere to protrude through the hydrosphere in shield-like\r\ncontinents whose distribution, as shown by the rocks of this period, is\r\nof great significance. Within the northern hemisphere rose three land\r\nshields spaced at nearly equal intervals and at nearly equal distances\r\nfrom the northern pole. One of these was centered where now is Hudson\r\nBay, another about the present Baltic Sea, and the relics of the third\r\nare found in northeastern Siberia. These earliest continents have been\r\nreferred to as the Laurentian, Baltic, and Angara shields. Within\r\nthe southern hemisphere shields appear to have developed in somewhat\r\nsimilar grouping, namely, in South America, in South Africa, and in\r\nAustralia (Figs. 3 and 5).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 5.—Approximations to earlier and present figures of the earth.]\r\n\r\nThese coigns or angles of a form into which the earlier spheroid of the\r\nearth was being transformed have persisted through the greater part\r\nof subsequent geologic time, and have been enlarged by the growth of\r\nsediments about them as well as by the later elevation and wrinkling\r\nof these deposits into marginal mountain ranges.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The continents and oceans which arose at the close of the Paleozoic\r\nera.=—At the close of the second great era in the recorded history\r\nof the earth, the now somewhat enlarged continents were profoundly\r\naltered during a series of convulsive movements within the surface\r\nshell of the lithosphere. When these convulsions were over, there was\r\na new disposition of land and sea, but one quite different from the\r\npresent arrangement. Instead of being extended in north-south belts, as\r\nthey are at present, the continents stretched out in broad east-west\r\nzones, one in the northern and the other in the southern hemisphere.\r\nTo the broad southern continent of which so little now remains, the\r\nname “Gondwana Land” has been given, and to the sea which divided the\r\nnorthern from the southern continent the name “Ocean of Tethys.” The\r\nnorthern continent stretched across the site of the present Atlantic\r\nOcean as the “North Atlantis”, its northern shore to the westward\r\nbeing somewhat farther south than the present northern coast of North\r\nAmerica, since life forms migrated in the northern ocean from the site\r\nof Behring Sea to that of the present North Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement of land and water during the middle period of the\r\nearth’s recorded history, when considered with reference both to its\r\nearlier and to its later evolution, may perhaps be best accounted\r\nfor by the assumption that the lithosphere was then shaped like Fig.\r\n5 (middle). In this figure two truncated tetrahedrons are joined in\r\na common plane of contact which may be described as the twin plane.\r\nThis medial depression upon the lithosphere was occupied by the\r\nintercontinental sea, the Ocean of Tethys.\r\n\r\nNear the close of this second great era of the earth’s continental\r\nhistory, crustal convulsions, which were perhaps the most remarkable in\r\nthe entire record, resulted in the almost complete disappearance of the\r\nsouthern continent and a concentration of the land within the northern\r\nhemisphere as a somewhat interrupted belt surrounding a central polar\r\nocean (Figs. 3 and 5).\r\n\r\nUpon the assumption of twin tetrahedrons in the intermediate era of\r\ncontinental evolution, both the Ocean of Tethys of that time and its\r\npresent remnants, the Caribbean and Mediterranean seas, are accounted\r\nfor. The V-shaped continent extensions and the A-shaped oceans of the\r\nsouthern hemisphere (Fig. 2) may likewise be considered as relics of\r\nthe now largely submerged tetrahedron of the southern hemisphere, since\r\nthis had its apex to the northward (Fig. 6).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 6.—Diagrams for comparison of shore lines upon tetrahedrons which\r\nhave an angle, the first at the south and the second at the north.]\r\n\r\nThus we see that the lithosphere can scarcely be regarded as a perfect\r\nspheroid, since in the course of geologic ages it has undergone\r\nsuccessive departures from this original form. In its present state it\r\nhas been described as tetrahedral, though we must keep in mind that\r\nthe sharp angles of that figure are deeply truncated. The soundings\r\nfirst by Nansen and more recently by Peary in the Arctic basin, far to\r\nthe north of the continental border, showed that this depression is\r\ncharacterized by profound depths, and so have afforded confirmation\r\nof the tetrahedral figure. To match this depression at the northern\r\nextremity of the earth’s axis, a high continent reaching to elevations\r\nin excess of 10,000 feet has been penetrated by Sir Ernest Shackleton\r\nat the opposite extremity of this polar diameter. Considering its size\r\nand its elevation, the Antarctic continent with its glacier mantle is\r\nthe largest protuberance upon the surface of the lithosphere.\r\n\r\nIn our study of the departures of the earth from the standard\r\nspheroidal surface, we might even go a step farther and show how\r\nthe tetrahedron, which best represents the symmetry of the present\r\nfigure, is somewhat deformed by a flattening perpendicular to the\r\nPacific Ocean. To draw attention to this flattening of the earth, it\r\nhas sometimes been described as “potato-shaped”, since the outline\r\nperpendicular to this face is imperfectly heart-shaped or like a\r\nflattened “peg top.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 7.—The continents with submerged portions added (after Gilbert).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The flooded portions of the present continents.=—We are accustomed\r\nto think of the continents as ending at the shores of the oceans.\r\nIf, however, we are to regard them as platforms which rise from the\r\nocean depressions, their margins should be considerably extended, for\r\na submerged shelf now practically surrounds all the continents to a\r\nnearly uniform depth of 100 fathoms or 600 feet. The oceans thus more\r\nthan fill their basins and may be thought of as spilling over upon the\r\ncontinents. In Fig. 7, the submerged portions of the continents have\r\nbeen joined to those usually represented, thus adding about 10,000,000\r\nsquare miles to their area, and giving them one third, instead of one\r\nfourth, of the lithosphere surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 8.—Diagram to indicate the altitude of different parts of the\r\nlithosphere surface.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The floors of the hydrosphere and atmosphere.=—The highest altitudes\r\nupon the continents and the profoundest deeps of the ocean are each\r\nremoved about 30,000 feet, or nearly 6 miles, from the level of the\r\nsea. In comparison with the entire surface of the lithosphere, these\r\nextremes of elevation represent such small areas as to be almost\r\ninappreciable. Only about 1/80 of the lithosphere surface rises more\r\nthan 6000 feet above sea level, and about the same proportion lies\r\ndeeper than 18,000 feet below the same datum plane (Fig. 8). Almost\r\nthe entire area of the lithosphere is included either in the so-called\r\ncontinental plateau or platform, in the oceanic platform, or in the\r\nslope which separates the two. The continental platform includes the\r\ncontinental shelf above referred to, and represents about one third of\r\nthe entire area of the planet. This platform has a range of elevation\r\nfrom 6000 feet above to 600 feet below sea level and has an average\r\naltitude of about 2300 feet. The oceanic platform slopes more steeply,\r\nranges in depth from 12,000 to 18,000 feet below sea level, and\r\ncomprises about one half the lithosphere surface. The remaining portion\r\nof the surface, something less than one eighth of all, is included in\r\nthe steep slopes between the two platforms, between 600 and 12,000\r\nfeet below sea. The two platforms and the slope between them must\r\nnot, however, be thought of as continuous features upon the surface,\r\nbut merely as representing the average elevations of portions of the\r\nlithosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n READING REFERENCES FOR CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n On the evolution of ideas concerning the earth’s figure:—\r\n\r\n SUESS.

This notion was clearly an outgrowth of the\r\nthen generally accepted Laplacian hypothesis of the origin of the\r\nuniverse, which assumed fluid interiors for the planets, the crust\r\nbeing suggested by the winter crust of frozen water upon the surface of\r\nour inland lakes. To-day the nebular hypothesis in the Laplacian form\r\nis fast giving place to quite different conceptions, in which solid\r\nparticles, and not gaseous ones, are conceived to have built up the\r\nlithosphere. The analogy with frozen water has likewise been abandoned\r\nwith the discovery that frozen rock, instead of floating, sinks in its\r\nmolten equivalent.\r\n\r\nYet even more cogent arguments have been brought forward to show that\r\nwhatever may be the state of aggregation within the earth’s core—and\r\nit may be different from any now known to us—it nevertheless has many\r\nof the properties recognized as belonging to solid and rigid bodies.\r\nProvisionally, therefore, we may regard the earth’s core as rigid and\r\nessentially solid. It was long ago pointed out by the late Lord Kelvin\r\nthat if our lithosphere were not more rigid than a ball of glass of the\r\nsame size, it would be constantly passing through periodic six-hourly\r\ndistortions of great amplitude in response to the varying attractions\r\nof the moon. An equally striking argument emanating from the same high\r\nauthority is furnished by the well-known egg-spinning demonstration.\r\nFor illustration, Kelvin was accustomed to take two eggs, one boiled\r\nand the other raw, and attempt to spin them upon their ends. For the\r\nboiled, and essentially solid, egg this is easily accomplished, but\r\ninternal friction of the liquid contents of the raw egg quickly stops\r\nany rotary motion which is imparted to it. Upon the same grounds it\r\nis argued that had the earth’s interior possessed the properties of a\r\nliquid, rotation must long since have ceased.\r\n\r\nA stronger proof of earth rigidity than either of these has been lately\r\nfurnished by the instrumental study of earthquakes. With the delicate\r\napparatus which is now installed for the purpose, heavy earthquakes may\r\nbe sensed which have occurred anywhere upon the earth’s surface, the\r\nearth movement sending its own message by the shortest route through\r\nthe core of the earth to the observing station. A heavy shock which\r\noccurs in New Zealand is recorded in England, almost diametrically\r\nopposite, in about twenty-one minutes after its occurrence. The laws\r\nof wave propagation and their relation to the properties of the\r\ntransmitting medium are well known, and in order to explain such\r\nextraordinary velocity it is necessary to assume that for such impulses\r\nthe earth’s interior is much more rigid than the finest tool steel.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Probable composition of the earth’s core.=—In deriving views\r\nconcerning the nature of the earth’s interior we are greatly aided\r\nby astronomical studies. The common origin long ago indicated for\r\nthe planets of the solar system and the sun has been confirmed by\r\nthe analysis of light with the aid of the spectroscope. It has thus\r\nbeen found that the same chemical elements which we find in the earth\r\nare present also in the sun and in the other stellar bodies. Again,\r\nthe group of planets of the solar system which are nearest to the\r\nsun—Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and Mars—have each a high density, all\r\nexcept Mars, the most distant, having specific gravities very closely\r\n5½, that of Mars being about 4. This average specific gravity is also\r\nthat of the solid bodies, the so-called meteorites, which reach the\r\nsurface of our planet from the surrounding space. Yet though the earth\r\nas a whole is thus found to have a specific gravity five and a half\r\ntimes that of water, its surface shell has an average density of less\r\nthan half this value, or 2.7.\r\n\r\nThe study of meteorites has given us a possible clew to the nature of\r\nthe earth’s interior; for when both terrestrial and celestial rock\r\ntypes are classified and placed in orderly arrangement, it is found\r\nthat the chemical elements which compose the two groups are identical,\r\nand that these are united according to the same physical and chemical\r\nlaws. No new element has been discovered in the one group that has not\r\nbeen found in the other, and though some compounds of these elements,\r\nthe minerals, occur in the earth’s crust that have not been found in\r\nmeteorites, and though some occur in meteorites which are not known\r\nfrom the earth, yet of those which are common to both bodies there is\r\nagreement, even to the minor details (Fig. 9). It is found, however,\r\nthat the commonest of the minerals in the earth’s shell are absent from\r\nmeteorites, as the commoner constituents of meteorites are wanting in\r\nthe earth’s crust. This observation would go far to show that we may in\r\nthe two cases be examining different portions of quite similar bodies;\r\nand this view is strikingly confirmed when the rocks of the two groups\r\nare arranged in the order of their densities (Fig. 9).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 9.—Diagram to show how terrestrial rocks grade into those of the\r\nmeteorites. 1, oxygen; 2, silicon; 3, aluminium; 4, alkali metals; 5,\r\nalkaline earth metals; 6, iron, nickel, cobalt, etc.; _a_, granites and\r\nrhyolites; _b_, syenites and trachytes; _c_, diorites and andesites;\r\n_d_, gabbros and basalts; _e_, ultra-basic rocks; _f_, basic inclosures\r\nin basalt, etc.; _g_, iron basalts of west Greenland; _h_, iron masses\r\nof Ovifak, west Greenland; _a’-d’_, meteorites in order of density\r\n(after Judd).]\r\n\r\nIn a broad way, density, structure, and chemical composition are all\r\nsimilarly involved in the gradations illustrated by the diagram; and it\r\nis significant that while there are terrestrial rocks not represented\r\nby meteorites, the densest and the most unusual of the terrestrial\r\nrocks are chemically almost identical with the less dense of the\r\ncelestial bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The earth a magnet.=—The denser, and likewise the more common, of\r\nthe meteorite rocks—the so-called meteoric irons—are composed almost\r\nentirely of the elements iron, nickel, and cobalt. Such aggregates\r\nare not known as yet from terrestrial sources, although transitional\r\ntypes appear to exist upon the island of Disco off the west coast of\r\nGreenland. If it were possible to explore the earth’s interior, would\r\nsuch combinations of the iron minerals be encountered? Apart from the\r\nsurprising velocity of transmission of earthquake waves, the strongest\r\nargument for an iron core to the lithosphere is found in the magnetic\r\nproperty of the earth as a whole. The only magnetic elements known to\r\nus are those of the heavy meteorites—iron, nickel, and cobalt,—and\r\nthe earth is, as we know, a great magnet whose northern pole in British\r\nAmerica and whose southern pole in Antarctica have at last been visited\r\nby Amundsen and David, respectively. The specific gravity of iron is\r\n7.15, and those of nickel and cobalt, which in the meteorites are\r\npresent in relatively small amounts, are 7.8 and 7.5, respectively.\r\nConsidering that the surface shell of the earth has a specific gravity\r\nof 2.7, these values must be regarded as agreeing well with the\r\ndetermined density of the earth (5.6) and the other planets of its\r\ngroup (Mercury 5.7, Venus 5.4, Mars 4).\r\n\r\n\r\n=The chemical constitution of the earth’s surface shell.=—The number\r\nof the so-called chemical elements which enter into the earth’s\r\ncomposition is more than eighty, but few of these figure as important\r\nconstituents of the portion known to us. Nearly one half of the mass\r\nof this shell is oxygen, and more than a quarter is silicon. The\r\nremaining quarter is largely made up of aluminium, iron, calcium,\r\nmagnesium, and the alkalies sodium and potassium, in the order named.\r\nThese eight constituent elements are thus the only ones which play any\r\nimportant rôle in the composition of the earth’s surface shell. They\r\nare not found there in the free condition, but combined in the definite\r\nproportions characteristic of chemical compounds, and as such they are\r\nknown as _minerals_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The essential nature of crystals.=—A crystal we are accustomed to\r\nthink of as something transparent bounded by sharp edges and angles,\r\nour ideas having been obtained largely from the gem minerals. This\r\noutward symmetry of form is, however, but an expression of a power\r\nwhich resides, so to speak, in the heart or soul of the crystal\r\nindividual—it has its own structural make-up, its individuality. No\r\nmore correct estimates of the comparison of crystal individualities\r\nwould be obtained by the study of outward forms alone of two minerals\r\nthan would be gained by a judgment of persons from the cut of their\r\nclothing. Too often this outward dress tells only of the conditions by\r\nwhich both men and crystals have been surrounded, and but little of the\r\npower inherent in the individual. Many a battered mineral fragment with\r\nlittle beauty to recommend it, when placed under suitable conditions\r\nfor its development, has grown into a marvel of beauty. Few minerals\r\nare so mean that they have not within them this inherent power of\r\nindividuality which lifts them above the world of the amorphous and\r\nshapeless.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 10.—Comparison of a crystalline with an amorphous substance when\r\nexpanded by heat and when attacked by acid.]\r\n\r\nJust as the real nature of a person is first disclosed by his behavior\r\nunder trying circumstances, so of a crystal it is its conduct under\r\nstress of one sort or another which brings out its real character. By\r\nway of illustration let us prepare a sphere from the mineral quartz—it\r\nmatters not whether we destroy the beautiful outlines of the crystal or\r\nemploy a battered fragment—and then prepare a sphere of similar size\r\nand shape from a noncrystalline or amorphous substance like glass. If\r\nnow these two spheres be introduced into a bath of oil and raised to a\r\nhigher temperature, the glass globe undergoes an enlargement without\r\nchange of its form; but the crystal ball reveals its individuality\r\nby expanding into a spheroid in which each new dimension is nicely\r\nadjusted to this more complex figure (Fig. 10).\r\n\r\nWe may, instead of submitting the two balls to the “trial by fire”,\r\nallow each to be attacked by the powerful reagent, hydrofluoric acid.\r\nThe common glass under the attack of the acid remains as it was before,\r\na sphere, but with shrunken dimensions. The crystal, on the other hand,\r\nis able to control the action of the solvent, and in so doing its\r\nindividuality is again revealed in a beautifully etched figure having\r\nmany curving outlines—it is as though the crystal had possessed a soul\r\nwhich under this trial has been revealed. This glimpse into the nature\r\nof the crystal, so as to reveal its structural beauty, is still more\r\nsurprising when the crystal is taken from the acid in the early stages\r\nof the action and held close beneath the eye. Now the little etchings\r\nupon the surface display each the individuality of the substance, and\r\njoining with their neighbors they send out a beautifully symmetrical\r\nand entirely characteristic picture (Fig. 11).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 11.—“Light figure” seen upon an etched surface of a crystal of\r\ncalcite (after Goldschmidt and Wright).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The lithosphere a complex of interlocking crystals.=—To the layman\r\nthe crystal is something rare and expensive, to be obtained from\r\na jeweler or to be seen displayed in the show cases of the great\r\nmuseums. Yet the one most striking quality of the lithosphere which\r\nseparates it from the hydrosphere and the atmosphere is its crystalline\r\nstructure,—a structure belonging also to the meteorite, and with\r\nlittle doubt to all the planets of the earth group. A snowflake caught\r\nduring its fall from the sky reveals all the delicate tracery of\r\ncrystal boundary; collected from a thick layer lying upon the ground,\r\nit appears as an intricate aggregate of broken fragments more or less\r\nfirmly cemented together. And so it is of the lithosphere, for the\r\nmyriads of individuals are either the ruins of former crystals, or\r\nthey are grown together in such a manner that crystal facets had no\r\nopportunity to develop.\r\n\r\nSuch mineral individuals as once possessed the crystal form may have\r\nbeen broken and their surfaces ground away by mutual attrition under\r\nthe rhythmic beating of the waves upon a shore or in the continuous\r\nrolling of pebbles on a stream bed, until as battered relics they\r\nare piled away together in a bed of sand. Yet no amount of such rough\r\nhandling is sufficient to destroy the crystal individuality, and if\r\nthey are now surrounded with conditions which are suitable for their\r\ngrowth, their individual nature again becomes revealed in new crystal\r\noutlines. Many of our sandstones when turned in the bright sunlight\r\nsend out flashes of light to rival a bank of snow in early spring.\r\nThese bright flashes proceed from the facets of minute crystals formed\r\nabout each rounded grain of the sand, and if we examine them under a\r\nlens, we may note the beauty of line formed with such exactness that\r\nthe most delicate instruments can detect no difference between the\r\nsimilar angles of neighboring crystals (Fig. 12).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 12.—Battered sand grains which have taken on a new lease of life\r\nand have developed a crystal form. _a_, a single grain grown into an\r\nindividual crystal; _b_, a parallel growth about a single grain; _c_,\r\ngrowth of neighboring grains until they have mutually interfered and so\r\ndestroyed the crystal facets—the common condition within the mass of a\r\nrock (after Irving and Van Hise).]\r\n\r\nThis individual nature of the crystal is believed to reside in a\r\nsymmetrical grouping of the chemical molecules of the substance into\r\nlarger and so-called “crystal molecules.” The crystal quality belongs\r\nto the chemical elements and to their compounds in the solid condition,\r\nbut not to ordinary mixtures of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Some properties of natural crystals, minerals.=—No two mineral\r\nspecies appear in crystals of the same appearance, any more than two\r\nanimal species have been given the same form; and so minerals may be\r\nrecognized by the individual peculiarities of their crystals. Yet\r\nfor the reason that crystals have so generally been prevented from\r\ndeveloping or retaining their characteristic faces, in the vast number\r\nof instances it is the behavior, and not the appearance, of the mineral\r\nsubstance which is made use of for identification.\r\n\r\nWhen a mineral is broken under the blow of a hammer, instead of\r\nyielding an irregular fracture, like that of glass, it generally\r\ntends to part along one or more directions so as to leave plane\r\nsurfaces. This property of _cleavage_ is strikingly illustrated\r\nfor a single direction in the mineral mica, for two directions in\r\nfeldspar, and for three directions in calcite or Iceland spar. Other\r\nproperties of minerals, such as hardness, specific gravity, luster,\r\ncolor, fusibility, etc., are all made use of in rough determinations\r\nof the minerals. Far more delicate methods depend upon the behavior\r\nof minerals when observed in polarized light, and such behavior is\r\nthe basis of those branches of geological science known as optical\r\nmineralogy and as microscopical petrography. An outline description of\r\nsome of the common minerals and the means for identifying them will be\r\nfound in appendix A.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The alterations of minerals.=—By far the larger number of minerals\r\nhave been formed in the cooling and consequent consolidation of molten\r\nrock material such as during a volcanic eruption reaches the earth’s\r\nsurface as lava. Beginning their growth at many points within the\r\nviscous mass, the individual crystals eventually may grow together and\r\nso prevent a development of their crystal faces.\r\n\r\nAnother class of minerals are deposited from solution in water within\r\nthe cavities and fissures of the rocks; and if this process ceases\r\nbefore the cavities have been completely closed, the minerals are\r\nfound projecting from the walls in a beautiful lining of crystal—the\r\n_Krystallkeller_ or “crystal cellar.” It is from such pockets or veins\r\nwithin the rocks that the valuable ores are obtained, as are the\r\ncrystals which are displayed in our mineral cabinets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 13.—Crystal of garnet developed in a schist with grains of quartz\r\nincluded because not assimilated.]\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a third process by which minerals are formed,\r\nand minerals of this class are produced within the solid rock as a\r\nproduct of the alteration of preëxisting minerals. Under the enormous\r\npressures of the rocks deep below the earth’s surface, they are as\r\npermeable to the percolating waters as is a sponge at the surface.\r\nUnder these conditions certain minerals are dissolved and their\r\nmaterial redeposited after traveling in the solution, or solution\r\nand redeposition of mineral matter may go on together within the mass\r\nof the same rock. One new mineral may have been produced from the\r\ndissolved materials of a number of earlier species, or several new\r\nminerals may be the result of the alteration of a preëxisting mineral\r\nwith a more complex chemical structure. Where the new mineral has been\r\nformed “in place”, it has sometimes been able to utilize the materials\r\nof all the minerals which before existed there, or it may have been\r\nobliged to inclose within itself those earlier constituents which it\r\ncould not assimilate in its own structure (Fig. 13).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 14.—A crystal of augite within the mass of a rock altered in\r\npart to form a rim of the minerals hornblende and magnetite. Note the\r\noriginal outline of the augite crystal.]\r\n\r\nAt other times a crystal which is imbedded in rock has been attacked\r\nupon its surface by the percolating solutions, and the dissolved\r\nmaterials have been deposited in place as a crown of new minerals\r\nwhich steadily widens its zone until the center is reached and the\r\noriginal crystal has been entirely transformed (Fig. 14). It is\r\nsometimes possible to say that the action by which these changes have\r\nbeen brought about has involved a nice adjustment of supply of the\r\nchemical constituents necessary to the formation of the new mineral or\r\nminerals. In rocks which are aggregates of several mineral species, a\r\nnewly formed mineral may appear only at the common margin of certain of\r\nthese species, thus showing that they supply those chemical elements\r\nwhich were necessary to the formation of the new substance (Fig. 15).\r\nThus it is seen that below the earth’s surface chemical reactions are\r\nconstantly going on, and the earlier rocks are thus locally being\r\ntransformed into others of a different mineral constitution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 15.—A new mineral (hornblende) forming as an intermediate\r\n“reaction rim” between the mineral having irregular fractures (olivine)\r\nand the dusty white mineral (lime-soda feldspar).]\r\n\r\nNear the earth’s surface the carbon dioxide and the moisture which are\r\npresent in the atmosphere are constantly changing the exposed portions\r\nof the lithosphere into carbonates, hydrates, and oxides. These\r\ncompounds are more soluble than are the minerals out of which they were\r\nformed, and they are also more bulky and so tend to crack off from\r\nthe parent mass on which they were formed. As we are to see, for both\r\nof these reasons the surface rocks of the lithosphere succumb to this\r\nattack from the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn connection with those wrinklings of the surface shell of the\r\nlithosphere from which mountains result, the underlying rocks are\r\nsubjected to great strains, and even where no visible partings are\r\nproduced, the rocks are deformed so that individual minerals may be\r\nbent into crescent-shaped or S-shaped forms, or they are parted into\r\none or more fragments which remain imbedded within the rock.\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING REFERENCES FOR CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n Theories of origin of the earth:—\r\n\r\n THOMSON and TAIT.

When a portion of the molten lithosphere,\r\nso-called _magma_, cools and consolidates, the product is _igneous_\r\nrock. Either igneous or other rock may become disintegrated at the\r\nearth’s surface, and after more or less extended travel, either in the\r\nair, in water, or in ice, be laid down as a sediment. Such sediments,\r\nwhether cemented into a coherent mass or not, are described as\r\n_sedimentary_ or _clastic_ rocks. If the fluid from which they were\r\ndeposited was the atmosphere, they are known as _subaërial_ or _eolian_\r\nsediments; but if water, they are known as _subaqueous_ deposits. Still\r\nanother class are ice-deposited and are known as _glacial_ deposits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 16.—Laminated structure of sedimentary rock, Western Kansas\r\n(after a photograph by E. S. Tucker).]\r\n\r\nBut, as we have learned, rocks may undergo transformations through\r\nmineral alteration, in which case they are known as _metamorphic_\r\nrocks. When these changes consist chiefly in the production of\r\nmore soluble minerals at the surface, accompanied by thorough\r\ndisintegration, due to the direct attack of the atmosphere, the\r\nresulting rocks are called _residual_ rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The marks of origin.=—Each of the three great classes of rocks,\r\nthe igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic, is characterized by both\r\ncoarser and finer structures, in the examination of which they may be\r\nidentified. The igneous rocks having been produced from magmas, which\r\nare essentially homogeneous, are usually without definite directional\r\nstructures due to an arrangement of their constituents, and are said\r\nto have a _massive_ structure. Sedimentary rocks, upon the other hand,\r\nhave been formed by an assorting process, the larger and heavier\r\nfragments having been laid down when there was high velocity of either\r\nwind or water current, and the smaller and lighter fragments during\r\nintermediate periods. They are therefore more or less banded, and are\r\nsaid to have a _bedded_ or _laminated_ structure (Fig. 16).\r\n\r\nAgain, igneous rocks, being due to a process of crystallization, are\r\ncomposed of mineral individuals which are bounded either by crystal\r\nplanes or by irregular surfaces along which neighboring crystals have\r\ninterfered with each other; but in either case the grains possess\r\nsharply angular boundaries. Quite different has been the result of\r\nthe attrition between grains in the transportation and deposition of\r\nsediments, for it is characteristic of the sedimentary rocks that their\r\nconstituent grains are well rounded. Eolian sediments have usually more\r\nperfectly rounded grains than subaqueous deposits.\r\n\r\nGlacial deposits, if laid down directly by the ice, are unstratified,\r\nrelatively coarse, and contain pebbles which are both faceted\r\nand striated. Such deposits are described as till or tillite. If\r\nglacier-derived material is taken up by the streams of thaw water and\r\nis by them redeposited, the sediments are assorted or stratified, and\r\nthey are described as _fluvio-glacial_ deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The metamorphic rocks.=—Both the coarser structures and the finer\r\ntextures of the metamorphic rocks are intermediate between those of\r\nthe igneous and the sedimentary classes. A metamorphosed sedimentary\r\nrock, in proportion to its alteration, loses the perfect lamination\r\nand the rounded grain which were its distinguishing characters; while\r\nan igneous rock takes on in the process an imperfect banding, and\r\nthe sharp angles of its constituent grains become rounded off by a\r\nsort of peripheral crushing or granulation. Metamorphic rocks are\r\ntherefore characterized by an imperfectly banded structure described\r\nas _schistosity_ or _gneiss banding_, and the constituent grains may\r\nbe either angular or rounded. If the metamorphism has not been too\r\nintense or too long continued, it is generally possible to determine,\r\nparticularly with the aid of the polarizing microscope, whether\r\nthe original rock from which it was derived was of igneous or of\r\nsedimentary origin. There are, however, many examples which have defied\r\na reliable verdict concerning their origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Characteristic textures of the igneous rocks.=—In addition to the\r\nmassiveness of their general aspect and the angular boundaries of\r\ntheir constituents, there are many additional textures which are\r\ncharacteristic of the igneous rocks. While those that have consolidated\r\nbelow the earth’s surface, the _intrusive_ rocks, are notably compact,\r\nthe magmas which arrive at the surface of the lithosphere before their\r\nconsolidation reveal special structures dependent either upon the\r\nexpansion of steam and other gases within them, or upon the conditions\r\nof flow over the earth’s surface. Magmas which thus reach the surface\r\nof the earth are described as _lavas_, and the rocks produced by their\r\nconsolidation are _extrusive_ or _volcanic_ rocks. The steam included\r\nin the lava expands into bubbles or vesicles which may be large or\r\nsmall, few or many. According to the number and the size of these\r\ncavities, the rock is said to have a _vesicular_, _scoriaceous_, or\r\n_pumiceous_ texture.\r\n\r\nMost lavas, when they arrive at the earth’s surface, contain crystals\r\nwhich are more or less disseminated throughout the molten mass. The\r\ntourist who visits Mount Vesuvius at the time of a light eruption\r\nmay thrust his staff into the stream of lava and extract a portion\r\nof the viscous substance in which are seen beautiful white crystals\r\nof the mineral leucite, each bounded by twenty-four crystal faces.\r\nIt is clear that these crystals must have developed by a slow growth\r\nwithin the magma while it was still below the surface, and when the\r\ninclosing lava has consolidated, these earlier crystals lie scattered\r\nwithin a _groundmass_ of glassy or minutely crystalline material.\r\nThis scattering of crystals belonging to an earlier generation within\r\na groundmass due to later consolidation is thus an indication of\r\ninterruption in the process of crystallization, and the texture which\r\nresults is described as _porphyritic_ (Fig. 17 _b_). Should the lava\r\narrive at the surface before any crystals have been generated and\r\nconsolidate rapidly as a rock glass, its texture is described as\r\n_glassy_ (Fig. 17 _c_).\r\n\r\nWhen the crystals of the earlier generation are numerous and\r\nneedle-like in form, as is very often the case, they arrange themselves\r\n“end on” during the rock flow, so that when consolidation has occurred,\r\nthe rock has a kind of puckered lamination which is the characteristic\r\nof the _fluxion_ or _flow_ texture. This texture has sometimes been\r\nconfused with the lamination of the sedimentary rocks, so that wrong\r\nconclusions have been reached regarding origin. At other times the same\r\nneedle-like crystals within the lava have grouped themselves radially\r\nto form rounded nodules called spherulites. Such nodules give to the\r\nrock a _spherulitic_ texture, which is nowhere better displayed than\r\nin the beautiful glassy lavas of Obsidian Cliff in the Yellowstone\r\nNational Park.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 17.—Characteristic textures of igneous rocks. _a_, granitic\r\ntexture characteristic of the deep-seated intrusive rocks; _b_,\r\nporphyritic texture characteristic of the extrusive and of the\r\nnear-surface intrusive rocks; _c_, glassy texture of an extrusive rock.]\r\n\r\nThose intrusive rocks which consolidate deep below the earth’s surface,\r\npart with their heat but slowly, and so the process of crystallization\r\nis continued without interruption. Starting from many centers,\r\nthe crystals continue to grow until they mutually intersect in an\r\ninterlocking complex known as the _granitic_ texture (Fig. 17 _a_).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Classification of rocks.=—In tabular form rocks may thus be\r\nclassified as follows:—\r\n\r\n                             {_Intrusive._ Granitic or porphyritic\r\n                             {    texture.\r\n  _Igneous._ Massive and     {_Extrusive._ Glassy or porphyritic\r\n    with sharply angular     {   texture; often also with vesicular,\r\n    grains.                  {   scoriaceous, pumiceous, fluxion,\r\n                             {   or spherulitic textures.\r\n\r\n                             {_Subaërial._ Sands and loess.\r\n                             {_Subaqueous._ (See below.)\r\n  _Sedimentary._ Laminate    { _Glacial._ Coarse, unstratified\r\n    and with rounded         {   deposits with faceted pebbles. Till\r\n    grains.                  {   and tillite.\r\n                             {_Fluvio-glacial._ Stratified sands\r\n                             {   and gravels with “worked over”\r\n                             {   glacial characters.\r\n\r\n  _Metamorphic._ Schistose   {_Metamorphic proper._ Due to below\r\n    and with grains either   {   surface changes.\r\n    angular or rounded.      {_Residual._ Disintegrated at or near\r\n                             {   surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Subdivisions of the sedimentary rocks.=—While the eolian sediments\r\nare all the product of a purely mechanical process of lifting,\r\ntransportation, and deposition of rock particles, this is not always\r\nthe case with the subaqueous sediments, since water has the power of\r\ndissolving mineral substance, as it has also of furnishing a home\r\nfor animal and vegetable life. Deposited materials which have been\r\nin solution in water are described as _chemical_ deposits, and those\r\nwhich have played a part in the life process as _organic_ deposits. The\r\norganic deposits from vegetable sources are peat and the coals, while\r\nlimestones and marls are the chief depositories of the remains of the\r\nanimal life of the water. The tabular classification of the sediments\r\nis as follows:—\r\n\r\n_Classification of Sediments._\r\n\r\n                    { _Subaqueous_               Conglomerate, sandstone\r\n                    {   Deposited by water.        and shale.\r\n                    { _Subaërial_ or _Eolian_    Sandstone and loess.\r\n  _Mechanical_      {   Deposited by wind.\r\n                    { _Glacial_                  Till and tillite.\r\n                    {   Deposited by ice.\r\n                    { _Fluvio-glacial_           Sands and gravels.\r\n                    {   Glacier-water deposits.\r\n\r\n                    { Calcareous tufa            Deposited in springs\r\n                    {                              and rivers.\r\n  _Chemical_        { Oölitic limestone          Deposited at the\r\n                    {                              mouths of rivers\r\n                    {                              between high and\r\n                    {                              low tide.\r\n\r\n                    { Formed of plant remains.   Peats and coals.\r\n  _Organic_         { Formed of animal remains.  Limestones and\r\n                    {                            marls.\r\n\r\nWinds are under favorable conditions capable of transporting both dust\r\nand sand, but not the larger rock fragments. The dust deposits are\r\nfound accumulating outside the borders of deserts as the so-called\r\n_loess_ (Fig. 216), though the sand is never carried beyond the desert\r\nborder, near which it collects in wide belts of ridges described as\r\ndunes. When this sand has been cemented into a coherent mass, it is\r\nknown as eolian sandstone. A section of the appendix (B) is devoted to\r\nan outline description of some of the commoner rock types.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The different deposits of ocean, lake, and river.=—Of the\r\nsubaqueous sediments, there are three distinct types resulting: (1)\r\nfrom sedimentation in rivers, the _fluviatile_ deposits; (2) from\r\nsedimentation in lakes, the _lacustrine_ deposits; and (3) from\r\nsedimentation in the ocean, _marine_ deposits. Again, the widest\r\nrange of character is displayed by the deposits which are laid down\r\nin the different parts of the course of a stream. Near the source of\r\na river, coarse river gravels may be found; in the middle course the\r\nfiner silts; and in the mouth or delta region, where the deposits\r\nenter the sea or a lake, there is found an assortment of silts and\r\nclays. Except within the delta region, where the area of deposition\r\nbegins to broaden, the deposits of rivers are stretched out in long and\r\nrelatively narrow zones, and are so distinguished from the far more\r\nimportant lacustrine and marine deposits.\r\n\r\nLakes and oceans have this in common that both are bodies of standing\r\nas contrasted with flowing water; and both are subject to the\r\nperiodical rhythmic motions and alongshore currents due to the waves\r\nraised by the wind. About their margins, the deposits of lake and ocean\r\nare thus in large part wrested by the waves from the neighboring land.\r\nTheir distribution is always such that the coarsest materials are laid\r\ndown nearest to the shore, and the deposits become ever finer in the\r\ndirection of deeper water. Relatively far from shore may be found the\r\nfinest sands and muds or calcareous deposits, while near the shore are\r\nsands, and, finally, along the beach, beds of beach pebbles or shingle.\r\nWhen cemented into coherent rocks, these deposits become shales or\r\nlimestones, sandstones, and conglomerates, respectively.\r\n\r\nAs regards the limestones, their origin is involved in considerable\r\nuncertainty. Some, like the shell limestone or coquina of the Florida\r\ncoast, are an aggregation of remains of mollusks which live near\r\nthe border of the sea. Other limestones are deposited directly from\r\ncarbonate of lime in solution in the water. A deposit of this nature is\r\nforming in southern Florida, both as a flocculent calcareous mud and as\r\ncrystals of lime carbonate upon a limestone surface. Again, there is\r\nthe reef limestone which is built up of the stony parts of the coral\r\nanimal, and, lastly, the calcareous ooze of the deep-sea deposits.\r\n\r\nThe marine sediments which are derived from the continents, the\r\nso-called _terrigenous_ deposits, are found only upon the continental\r\nshelf and upon the continental slope just outside it. Of these\r\nterrigenous deposits, it is customary to distinguish: (1) _littoral_\r\nor alongshore deposits, which are laid down between high and low tide\r\nlevels; (2) _shoal water_ deposits, which are found between low-water\r\nmark and the edge of the continental shelf; and (3) aktian or offshore\r\ndeposits, which are found upon the continental slope. The littoral and\r\nshoal water deposits are mainly gravels and sands, while the offshore\r\ndeposits are principally muds or lime deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Special marks of littoral deposits.=—The marks of ripples are often\r\nleft in the sand of a beach, and may be preserved in the sandstone\r\nwhich results from the cementation of such deposits (pl. 11 A). Very\r\nsimilar markings are, however, quite characteristic of the surface\r\nof wind-blown sand. For the reason that deposits are subject to many\r\nvicissitudes in their subsequent history, so that they sometimes stand\r\nat steep angles or are even overturned, it is important to observe the\r\ncurves of sand ripples so as to distinguish the upper from the lower\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nIn the finer sands and muds of sheltered tidal flats may be preserved\r\nthe impressions from raindrops or of the feet of animals which have\r\nwandered over the flat during an ebb tide. When the tide is at flood,\r\nnew material is laid down upon the surface and the impressions are\r\nfilled, but though hardened into rock, these surfaces are those upon\r\nwhich the rock is easily parted, and so the impressions are preserved.\r\nIn the sandstones of the Connecticut valley there has been preserved\r\na quite remarkable record in the footprints of animals belonging to\r\nextinct species, which at the time these deposits were laid down must\r\nhave been abundant upon the neighboring shores.\r\n\r\nBetween the tides muds may dry out and crack in intersecting lines\r\nlike the walls of a honeycomb, and when the cracks have been filled at\r\nhigh tide, a structure is produced which may later be recognized and\r\nis usually referred to as “mud-crack” structure. This structure is of\r\nspecial service in distinguishing marine deposits from the subaërial or\r\ncontinental deposits.\r\n\r\nA variation in the direction of winds of successive storms may be\r\nresponsible for the piling up of the beach sand in a peculiar “plunge\r\nand flow” or “cross-bedded” structure, a structure which is extremely\r\ncommon in littoral deposits, though simulated in rocks of eolian origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The order of deposition during a transgression of the sea.=—Many\r\nshore lines of the continents are almost constantly migrating either\r\nlandward or seaward. When the shore line advances over the land, the\r\ncoast is sinking, and marine deposits will be formed directly above\r\nwhat was recently the “dry land.” Such an invasion of the land by\r\nthe sea, due to a subsidence of the coast, is called a transgression\r\nof the sea, or simply a _transgression_. Though at any moment the\r\nlittoral, shoal water, and offshore deposits are each being laid down\r\nin a particular zone, it is evident that each must advance in turn in\r\nthe direction of the shore and so be deposited above the zones nearer\r\nshore. Thus there comes to be a definite series of continuous beds,\r\none above the other, provided only that the process is continued (Fig.\r\n18). At the very bottom of this series there will usually be found a\r\nthin bed of pebbly beach materials, which later will harden into the\r\nso-called _basal conglomerate_. If the size of the pebbles is such as\r\nto make possible an identification, it will generally be found that\r\nthese represent the ruins of the rock over which the sea has advanced\r\nupon the land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.—Diagram to show the order of the sediments\r\nlaid down during a transgression of the sea.]\r\n\r\nNext in order above the basal conglomerate, will follow the coarser and\r\nthen the finer sands, upon which in turn will be laid down the offshore\r\nsediments—the muds and the lime deposits. Later, when cemented\r\ntogether, these become in order, coarser and finer sandstones, shales,\r\nand limestones. The order of superposition, reading from the bottom to\r\nthe top, thus gives the order of decreasing age of the formations.\r\n\r\nA subsequent uplift of the coast will be accompanied by a recession\r\nof the sea, and when later dissected by nature for our inspection,\r\nthe order of superposition and the individual character of each of\r\nthe deposits may be studied at leisure. From such studies it has been\r\nfound that along with the inorganic deposits there are often found the\r\nremains of life in the hard parts of such invertebrate animals as the\r\nmollusks and the crustacea. These so-called _fossils_ represent animals\r\nwhich were gradually developed from simpler to more and more complex\r\nforms; and they thus serve the purpose of successive page numbers in\r\narranging the order of disturbed strata, at the same time that they\r\nsupply the most secure foundation upon which rests the great doctrine\r\nof evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The basins of earlier ages.=—It was the great Viennese geologist,\r\nProfessor Suess, who first pointed out that in mountain regions there\r\nare found the thickest and the most complete series of the marine\r\ndeposits; whereas outside these provinces the formations are separated\r\nby wide gaps representing periods when no deposits were laid down\r\nbecause the sea had retired from the region. The completeness of the\r\nseries of deposits in the mountain districts can only be interpreted to\r\nmean that where these but lately formed mountains rise to-day, were for\r\nlong preceding ages the basins for deposition of terrigenous sediments.\r\nIt would seem that the lithosphere in its adjustment had selected these\r\nearlier sea basins with their heavy layers of sediment for zones of\r\nspecial uplift.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The deposits of the deep sea.=—Outside the continental slope, whose\r\nbase marks the limit of the terrigenous deposits, lies the deeper sea,\r\nfor the most part a series of broad plains, but varied by more profound\r\nsteep-walled basins, the so-called “deeps” of the ocean. As shown by\r\nthe dredgings of the _Challenger_ expedition and others of more recent\r\ndate, the deposits upon the ocean floor are of a wholly different\r\ncharacter from those which are derived from the continents. Except in\r\nthe great deeps, or between depths of five hundred and fifteen hundred\r\nfathoms, these deposits are the so-called “ooze”, composed of the\r\ncalcareous or chitinous parts of algæ and of minute animal organisms.\r\nThe pelagic or surface waters of the ocean are, as it were, a great\r\nmeadow of these plant forms, upon which the minute crustacea, such\r\nas globigerina, foraminifera, and the pteropods, feed in countless\r\nmyriads. The hard parts of both plant and animal organisms descend to\r\nthe bottom and there form the ooze in which are sometimes found the ear\r\nbones of whales and the teeth of sharks.\r\n\r\nIn the deeps of the ocean, none of these vegetable or animal deposits\r\nare being laid down, but only the so-called “red clay”, which is\r\nbelieved to represent decomposed volcanic material deposited by the\r\nwinds as fine dust on the surface of the ocean, or the product of\r\nsubmarine volcanic eruption. From the absence of the ooze in these\r\nprofound depths, the conclusion is forced upon us that the hard parts\r\nof the minute organisms are dissolved while falling through three or\r\nfour miles of the ocean water.\r\n\r\n\r\n READING REFERENCES FOR CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n J.

At the sea level the weight of air\r\nupon each square inch of surface is about fifteen pounds, whereas upon\r\nthe floor of the hydrosphere in the more profound deeps the load upon\r\nthe square inch must be measured in tons. Near the lithosphere surface\r\nthe rocks support by their strength the load of rock above them, but\r\nat greater depths they are unable to do this, for the load bears upon\r\neach portion of the rock with a pressure equivalent to the weight\r\nof a rock column which extends upward to the surface. The average\r\nspecific gravity of rock is 2.7, and it is thus easy to calculate the\r\nlength of the inch square column which has a weight equivalent to the\r\ncrushing strength of any given rock. At the depth represented by the\r\nlength of such a column, rocks cannot yield to pressure by fracture,\r\nfor the opening of a crack implies that the rock upon either side is\r\nstrong enough to prevent the walls from closing. At this depth, rock\r\nmust therefore yield to pressure not by fracture, as it would at the\r\nsurface, but by flow after the manner of a liquid; and so the zone\r\nbelow this critical level is referred to as the _zone of flow_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 19.—Two intersecting parallel series of fractures produced upon\r\neach free surface of a prismatic block of stiff molders’ wax when\r\nbroken by compression from the ends (after Daubrée and Tresca).]\r\n\r\nIn contrast, the near-surface zone is called the _zone of fracture_.\r\nBut different rocks possess different strengths, and these are subject\r\nto modifications from other conditions, such, for example, as the\r\nproximity of an uncooled magma. The zone of flow is therefore joined\r\nto the zone of fracture, not upon a definite surface, but in an\r\nintermediate zone described as the _zone of fracture and flow_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Experiments which illustrate the fracture and flow of solid\r\nbodies.=—A prismatic block prepared from stiff molders’ wax, if\r\ncrushed between the jaws of a testing machine, yields a system of\r\nintersecting fractures which are perpendicular to the free surfaces\r\nof the block and take two directions each inclined by half of a right\r\nangle to the direction of compression (Fig. 19). This experiment\r\nmay illustrate the manner in which fractures are produced by the\r\ncompression within the zone of fracture of the lithosphere, as its core\r\ncontinues to contract.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the conditions within the zone of flow, it will be\r\nnecessary to load the lateral surfaces of the block instead of leaving\r\nthem unconstrained as in the above-described experiment. The experiment\r\nis best devised as in Fig. 20. Here a series of layers having varying\r\ndegrees of rigidity is prepared from beeswax as a base, either\r\nstiffened by admixture of varying proportions of plaster of Paris, or\r\nweakened by the use of Venice turpentine. Such a series of layers may\r\nrepresent rocks of as widely different characters as limestone and\r\nshale. The load which is to represent superincumbent rock is supplied\r\nin the experiment by a deep layer of shot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.—Apparatus to illustrate the folding of strata\r\nwithin the zone of flow (after Willis).]\r\n\r\nWhen compression is applied to the layers from the ends, these normally\r\nsolid materials, instead of fracturing, are bent into a series of\r\nfolds. The stiffer, or more competent, layers are found to be less\r\ncontorted than are the weaker layers, particularly if the latter have\r\nbeen protected under an arch of the more competent layer (pl. 2 A).\r\n\r\n\r\n=The arches and troughs of the folded strata.=—Every series of folds\r\nis made up of alternating arches and troughs. The arches of the strata\r\nthe geologist calls _anticlines_ or _anticlinal folds_, and the troughs\r\nhe calls _synclines_ or _synclinal folds_ (Fig. 21). When a stratum is\r\nmerely dropped in a bend to a lower level without producing a complete\r\narch or a complete trough, this half fold is termed a _monocline_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 21.—Diagrams representing _a_, an anticline; _b_, a syncline; and\r\n_c_, a monocline.]\r\n\r\nAny flexuring of the strata implies a reduction of their surface area,\r\nor, considering a single section, a shortening. If the arches and\r\ntroughs are low and broad, the deformation of the strata is slight,\r\nthe shortening is comparatively small, and the folds are described as\r\n_open_ (Fig. 22 _b_). If they be relatively both high and narrow, the\r\ndeformation is considerable, a larger amount of crustal shortening has\r\ngone on, and the folds are described as _close_ (Fig. 22 _c_). This\r\nclosing up of the folds may continue until their sides have practically\r\nthe same slope, in which case they are said to be _isoclinal_ (Fig. 22\r\n_d_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 22.—A comparison of folds to express increasing degrees of\r\ncrustal shortening or progressive deformation within the zone of flow:\r\n_a_, stratum before folding; _b_, open folds; _c_, close folds; _d_,\r\nisoclinal folds.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The elements of folds.=—Folds must always be thought of as having\r\nextension in each of the three dimensions of space (Fig. 23), and not\r\nas properly included within a single plane like the cross sections\r\nwhich we so often use in illustration. A fold may be conceived of as\r\ndivided into equal parts by a plane which passes along the middle of\r\neither the arch or the trough, and is called the _axial plane_. The\r\nline in which this plane intersects the arch or the trough is the\r\n_axis_, which may be called the _crestline_ in an anticline, and the\r\n_troughline_ in a syncline.\r\n\r\nIn the case of many open folds the axis is practically horizontal, but\r\nin more complexly folded regions this is seldom true. The departure of\r\nthe axis from the horizontal is called the _pitch_, and folds of this\r\ntype are described as _pitching folds_ or _plunging folds_. The axis\r\nis in reality in these cases thrown into a series of undulations or\r\n“longitudinal folds”, and hence pitch will vary along the axis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.—Anticlinal and synclinal folds in strata\r\n(after Willis).]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 24.—Diagrams to illustrate the different shapes of rock folds.]\r\n\r\n=The shapes of rock folds.=—By the axial plane each fold is divided\r\ninto two parts which are called its _limbs_, which may have either the\r\nsame or different average inclinations. To describe now the shapes\r\nof rock folds and not the degree of compression of the district,\r\nsome additional terms are necessary. Anticlines or synclines whose\r\nlimbs have about the same inclinations are known as _upright_ or\r\n_symmetrical folds_. The axial plane of the symmetrical fold is\r\nvertical (Fig. 24). If this plane is inclined to the vertical, the\r\nfolds are _unsymmetrical_. So soon as the steeper of the two limbs has\r\npassed the vertical position and inclines in the same direction as the\r\nflatter limb, the fold is said to be _overturned_. The departure from\r\nsymmetry may go so far that the axial plane of the fold lies at a very\r\nflat angle, and the fold is then said to be _recumbent_. The observant\r\ntraveler by train along any of the routes which enter the Alps may from\r\nhis car window find illustrations of most of these types of rock folds,\r\nas he may also, though generally less easily, in passing through the\r\nAppalachian Mountains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.—Secondary and tertiary flexures superimposed\r\nupon the primary ones.]\r\n\r\nIn regions which have been closely folded the larger flexures of\r\nthe strata may be found with folds of a smaller order of magnitude\r\nsuperimposed upon them, and these in turn may show crumplings of still\r\nlower orders. It has been found that the folds of the smaller orders\r\nof magnitude possess the shapes of the larger flexures, and much is\r\ntherefore to be learned from their careful study (Fig. 25). It is also\r\nquite generally discovered that parallel planes of ready parting,\r\nwhich are described as _rock cleavage_, take their course parallel to\r\nthe axial plane within each minor fold. As was long ago shown by the\r\npioneer British geologists, these planes of cleavage are essentially\r\nparallel and follow the fold axes throughout large areas.\r\n\r\n┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n│ PLATE 2.                                                               │\r\n│                                                                        │\r\n│ [Illustration: _A._ Layers compressed in experiments and showing the   │\r\n│ effect of a competent layer in the process of folding (after Willis).] │\r\n│                                                                        │\r\n│ [Illustration: _B._ Experimental production of a series of parallel    │\r\n│ thrusts within closely folded strata (after Willis).]                  │\r\n│                                                                        │\r\n│ [Illustration: _C._ Apparatus to illustrate shearing action within the │\r\n│ overturned limb of a fold.]                                            │\r\n└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\r\n\r\n=The overthrust fold.=—Whenever a stratum is bent, there is a tendency\r\nfor its particles to be separated upon the convex side of the bend,\r\nat the same time that those upon the concave side are crowded closer\r\ntogether—there is tension in the former case and compression in the\r\nlatter (Fig. 26). Within an unsymmetrical or an overturned fold, the\r\npeculiar distortions in the different sections of the stratum are less\r\nsimple and are best illustrated by pl. 2 C. This apparatus shows two\r\nsimilar piles of paper sheets, upon the edges of each of which a series\r\nof circles has been drawn. When now one of the piles is bent into an\r\nunsymmetrical fold, it is seen that through an accommodation by the\r\npaper sheets sliding each over its neighbor large distortions of the\r\ncircles have occurred. In that steeper limb which with closer folding\r\nwill be overturned the circles have been drawn out into long and narrow\r\nellipses, and this indicates that those rock particles which before the\r\nbending were included in the circle have been moved past each other in\r\nthe manner of the blades of a pair of shears. Such extreme “shearing”\r\naction is thus localized in the underturned limb of the fold, and a\r\ntime must come with continuation of the compression when the fold\r\nwill rupture at this critical place along a plane parallel to the\r\nlongest axis of the ellipses or nearly parallel to the axial plane of\r\nthe anticline. Such structures probably occur in the zone of combined\r\nfracture and flow, up into which the beds are forced in cases of close\r\ncompression. Relief thus being found upon this plane of fracture,\r\nthe upper portion of the fold will now ride over the lower, and the\r\ndisplacement is described as a _thrust_ or _overthrust_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 26.—A bent stratum to illustrate tension upon the convex and\r\ncompression upon the concave side (after Van Hise).]\r\n\r\nIn the long series of experiments conducted by Mr. Bailey Willis of the\r\nUnited States Geological Survey, all the stages between the overturned\r\nfold and the overthrust fold were reproduced. Where a series of folds\r\nwas closely compressed, a parallel series of thrusts developed (pl. 2\r\nB), so that a series of slices cutting across neighboring strata was\r\nslid in succession, each over the other, like the scales upon a fish\r\nor the shingles upon a roof. Quite remarkable structures of this kind\r\nhave been discovered in rocks of such closely folded districts as the\r\nNorthwest Highlands of Scotland, where the overriding is measured in\r\nmiles. Near the thrust planes the rocks show a crushing of the grains,\r\nand the planes themselves are sometimes corrugated and polished by the\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Restoration of mutilated folds.=—Since flexuring of the rocks takes\r\nplace within the zone of flow at a distance of several miles below the\r\nearth’s surface, it is quite obvious that the results of the process\r\ncan be studied only after some thousands of feet of superincumbent\r\nstrata have been removed. We are a little later to see by what\r\nprocesses this lowering of the surface is accomplished, but for the\r\npresent it may be sufficient to accept the fact, realizing that before\r\nfoldings in the strata can reach the surface, they must have passed\r\nthrough the upper zone of fracture.\r\n\r\nIt might perhaps be supposed that the anticlines would appear as\r\nthe mountains upon the surface, and occasionally this is true; as,\r\nfor example, in the folded Jura Mountains of western Europe. More\r\ngenerally, the mountains have a synclinal structure and the valleys an\r\nanticlinal one; but as no general rule can be applied, it is necessary\r\nto make a restoration of the truncated folds in each district before\r\ntheir character can be known.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The geological map and section.=—The earth’s surface is in most\r\nregions in large part covered with soil or with other incoherent rock\r\nmaterial, so that over considerable areas the hard rocks are hidden\r\nfrom view. Each locality at which the rock is found at the earth’s\r\nsurface “in place” is described as an _outcropping_ or _exposure_. In\r\na study of the region each such exposure must be examined to determine\r\nthe nature of the rock, especially for the purpose of correlation\r\nwith neighboring exposures, and, in addition, both the probable\r\ndirection in which it is continued along the surface—the _strike_—and\r\nthe inclination of its beds—the _dip_. If the outcroppings are\r\nsufficiently numerous, and rock type, strike and dip, may all be\r\ndetermined, the folds of the district may be restored with almost as\r\nmuch accuracy as though their curves were everywhere exposed to view.\r\nA cross section through the surface which represents the observed\r\noutcrops with their inclinations and the assumed intermediate strata\r\nin their probable attitudes is described as a _geological section_\r\n(Fig. 27). A map upon which the data have been entered in their correct\r\nlocations, either with or without assumptions concerning the covered\r\nareas, is known as a _geological map_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.—A geological section based upon observations\r\nat outcrops, but with the truncated arches restored.]\r\n\r\nIf the axes of folds are absolutely horizontal, and the surface of\r\nthe earth be represented as a plain, the lines of intersection of the\r\ntruncated strata with the ground, or with any horizontal surface, will\r\ngive the directions of continuation of the individual strata. This\r\nstrike direction is usually determined at each exposure by use of a\r\ncompass provided with a spirit level. When that edge of the leveled\r\ncompass which is parallel to the north-south line upon the dial is held\r\nagainst the sloping rock stratum, the angle of strike is measured in\r\ndegrees by the compass needle. If the cardinal directions have been\r\nplaced in their correct positions upon the compass dial, the needle\r\nwill point to the northwest when the strike is northeast, and _vice\r\nversa_ (Fig. 28 _a_). Upon the geologist’s compass it is therefore\r\ncustomary to reverse the initials which represent the east and west\r\ndirections, in order that the correct strike may be read directly from\r\nthe dial (Fig. 28 _b_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 28.—Diagram to illustrate the manner of determining the strike\r\nof rock beds at an outcropping. _a_, a compass which has the cardinal\r\ndirections in their natural positions; _b_, a compass with the east\r\nand west initials reversed upon the dial; _c_, home-made clinometer in\r\nposition to determine the dip.]\r\n\r\nBy the dip is meant the inclination of the stratum at any exposure, and\r\nthis must obviously be measured in a vertical plane along the steepest\r\nline in the bedding plane. The dip angle is always referred to a\r\nhorizontal plane, and hence vertical beds have a dip of 90°. The device\r\nfor measuring this angle of dip, the _clinometer_, is merely a simple\r\npendulum which serves as an indicator and is centered at the corner of\r\na graduated quadrant. A home-made variety is easily constructed from a\r\nsquare piece of board and an attached paper quadrant (Fig. 28 _c_), but\r\nthe geologist’s compass is always provided with a clinometer attachment\r\nto the dial.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 29.—Diagram to show the use of T symbols to indicate the dip and\r\nstrike of outcroppings.]\r\n\r\nSince the strike is the intersection of the bedding plane with\r\na horizontal surface, and the dip is the intersection with that\r\nparticular vertical plane which gives the steepest inclination, the\r\nstrike and dip are perpendicular to each other. To represent them upon\r\nmaps, it is more or less customary to use the so-called T symbols, the\r\ntop of the T giving the direction of the strike and the shank that of\r\nthe dip. If meridians are drawn upon the map, the direction or attitude\r\nof the T can be found by the use of a simple protractor; and when\r\nentered upon the map, the exact angle of the strike may be supplied by\r\na figure near the top of the T, and the dip angle by a figure at the\r\nend of the shank. It is the custom, also, to make the length of the\r\nshank inversely proportional to the steepness of the dip, so that in\r\na broad way the attitudes of the strata may be taken in at a glance\r\n(Fig. 29). It is further of advantage to make the top of the T a double\r\nline, so that some symbol or color may show the correlations of the\r\ndifferent exposures. To illustrate, in Fig. 29, the symbol marked _a_\r\nrepresents an outcrop of limestone, the strike of which is 50° east\r\nof north (N. 50° E.), and the dip of which is 45° southeast. In the\r\nsame figure _b_ represents a shale outcrop in horizontal beds, which\r\nhave in consequence a universal strike and a dip of 0°. An exposure of\r\nlimestone in vertical beds which strike N. 60° E. is shown at _c_, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 30.—Diagram to show how the thickness of a formation may be\r\nobtained from the angle of the dip and the width of the exposures.]\r\n\r\n=Measurement of the thickness of formations.=—When formations still\r\nlie in horizontal beds, we may sometimes learn their thickness\r\ndirectly either from the depth of borings to the underlying rock, or\r\nby measurements upon steep cañon walls. If the beds stand vertically,\r\nthe matter is exceedingly simple, for in this case the thickness is the\r\nwidth of the outcrops of the formation between the beds which bound it\r\nupon either side. In the general case, in which the beds are neither\r\nhorizontal nor vertical, the thickness must be obtained indirectly from\r\nthe width of the exposures and the angle of the dip. The factor by\r\nwhich the exposure width must be multiplied is known as the sine of the\r\ndip angle (Fig. 30), which is given with sufficient accuracy for most\r\npurposes in the following table. It is obvious that in order to obtain\r\nthe full thickness of a formation it is necessary to measure from the\r\ncontact with the adjacent formation upon the one side to a similar\r\ncontact with the nearest formation upon the other.\r\n\r\n_Natural Sines_\r\n\r\n   0°   .00          35°   .57          70°   .94\r\n   5°   .09          40°   .64          75°   .97\r\n  10°   .17          45°   .71          80°   .98\r\n  15°   .26          50°   .77          85°  1.00\r\n  20°   .34          55°   .82          90°  1.00\r\n  25°   .42          60°   .87\r\n  30°   .50          65°   .91\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.—Combined surface and sectional views of a\r\nplunging anticline (after Willis).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.—Combined surface and sectional views of a\r\nplunging syncline (after Willis).]\r\n\r\n=The detection of plunging folds.=—When the axis of a fold is\r\nhorizontal, its outcrops upon a plain will continue to have the same\r\nstrike until the formation comes to an end. Upon a generally level\r\nsurface, therefore, any regular progressive variation in the strike\r\ndirection is an indication that the folds have a plunging or pitching\r\ncharacter. Many serious mistakes of interpretation have been made\r\nbecause of a failure to recognize this evidence of plunging folds. The\r\nway in which the strikes are progressively modified will be made clear\r\nby the diagrams of Figs. 31 and 32, the first representing a pitching\r\nanticline and the second a pitching syncline. In both these reciprocal\r\ncases the strikes of the beds undergo the same changes, and the dip\r\ndirections serve to distinguish which of the two structures is present\r\nin a given case. There is, however, one further difference in that the\r\nhard layers of the plunging anticline, where they disappear below\r\nthe surface in the axis, will present a domed surface sloping forward\r\nlike the back of a whale as it rises above the surface of the sea.\r\nPlunging folds in series will thus appear in the topography as a series\r\nof sharply zigzagging ranges at those localities where the harder\r\nlayers intersect the surface. Such features are encountered in eastern\r\nPennsylvania, where the hard formations of the Appalachian Mountain\r\nsystem plunge northeastward under the later formations. The pitch of\r\nthe larger fold is often disclosed by that of the minor puckerings\r\nsuperimposed upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 33.—Unconformity between a lower and an upper series of beds upon\r\nthe coast of California. Note how the hard layer stands in relief upon\r\nthe connecting surface (after Fairbanks).]\r\n\r\n=The meaning of an unconformity.=—The rock beds, which are deposited\r\none above the other during a transgression of the sea, are usually\r\nparallel and thus represent a continuous process of deposition. Such\r\nbeds are said to be _conformable_. Where, upon the other hand, two\r\nseries of deposits which are not parallel to each other are separated\r\nby a break, they are said to form _unconformable_ series, and the break\r\nor surface of junction is an _unconformity_ (Fig. 33).\r\n\r\nHere it is evident that the sediments which compose the lower series\r\nof beds have been folded in the zone of flow, though the upper series\r\nhas evidently escaped this vicissitude. Furthermore, the surface which\r\ndelimits the lower series from the upper is somewhat irregular and\r\nshows a hard layer standing in relief, as it would if it had opposed\r\ngreater resistance to the attacks of the atmosphere upon it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 34.—Series of diagrams to illustrate in succession the episodes\r\ninvolved in the historical development of an angular unconformity. The\r\nvertical arrows indicate direction of movement of the land, and the\r\nhorizontal arrows the direction of shore migration.]\r\n\r\nIn reality, an unconformity between formations must be interpreted to\r\nmean that the lower series is not only older than the upper, as shown\r\nby the order of superposition, but that the time of its deposition was\r\nseparated from that of the upper by a hiatus in which important changes\r\ntook place in the lower series. The stages or episodes in the history\r\nof the beds represented in Fig. 33 may be read as follows (see Fig. 34\r\n_a-e_):—\r\n\r\n(_a_) Deposition of the lower series during a transgression of the sea.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Continued subsidence and burial of the lower series beneath\r\noverlying sediments, and flexuring in the zone of flow.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Elevation of the combined deposits to and far above sea level and\r\nremoval by erosion of vast thicknesses of the upper sediments.\r\n\r\n(_d_) A new subsidence of the truncated lower series and deposition of\r\nthe upper series across its eroded surface.\r\n\r\n(_e_) A new elevation of the double series to its present position\r\nabove sea level.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 35.—Types of deceptive or erosional unconformities.]\r\n\r\nFrom this succession of episodes it is seen that a break of this\r\nkind between two series of deposits involves a double oscillation of\r\nsubsidence followed by elevation—a large depression followed by a\r\nlarge elevation, a smaller subsidence followed by elevation. The time\r\ninterval which must have been represented by these repeated operations\r\nis so vast as at first to stagger the mind in contemplating it. When,\r\nas in this instance, the dips of the lower series of beds differ from\r\nthose of the upper, we have to do with an _angular unconformity_.\r\nIt may be, however, that the lower series was not so far depressed\r\nas to enter the zone of flow, and that its beds meet those of the\r\nupper series with apparent conformity. Such an unconformity is often\r\nextremely difficult to recognize, and it is described as a _deceptive_\r\nor _erosional unconformity_.\r\n\r\nWith a deceptive unconformity the clew to its real nature is usually\r\nsome fact which indicates that the lower series of sediments had been\r\nraised above the level of the sea before the upper series was deposited\r\nupon it. This may be apparent either in the irregularity of the surface\r\non which the two series are joined, in some evidence of the action of\r\nwaves such as would be furnished by a basal conglomerate in the upper\r\nseries, or some indication of different resistance of different rocks\r\nof the lower series to attacks of the atmosphere upon them (Figs. 33\r\nand 35 _a-c_).\r\n\r\nIn most cases, at least, the lowest member of the upper series will\r\nbe a different type of rock from the uppermost member of the lower\r\nseries, hence the frequent occurrence of the discordant cross bedding\r\nin sandstone should not deceive even the novice into the assumption of\r\nan unconformity.\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING REFERENCES TO CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n The zones of fracture and flow:—\r\n\r\n C.

S. G. S.).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 37.—Diagram to show how sets of master joints differing in\r\ndirection by half a right angle may abruptly replace each other.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 38.—Diagram to show the different combinations of the series\r\ncomposing two double sets of master joints, and in _a_, _a_, _a_\r\nadditional disorderly fractures.]\r\n\r\n=The system of the fractures.=—In referring to experiments made upon\r\nthe fracture of solid blocks under compression (p. 41), it was shown\r\nthat two series of parallel fractures develop perpendicular to each\r\nfree surface of the block, and that these series are each of them\r\ninclined by half of a right angle to the direction of compression, and\r\nthus perpendicular to each other. The fragments into which a block\r\nwith one free surface would thus tend to be divided should be square\r\nprisms perpendicular to the free surface. It would be interesting, if\r\nit were practicable, to learn from experiment how these prisms would be\r\nfurther fractured by a continuation of the compression. From mechanical\r\nconsiderations involving the resolution of forces with reference to\r\nthe ready-formed fractures, it seems probable that the next series of\r\nfractures to form would bisect the angles of the first double series\r\nor set. Wherever rocks are found exposed in their original attitudes,\r\nthey are, in fact, seen to be intersected by two parallel series of\r\nfractures which are perpendicular to the earth’s surface and to each\r\nother and are described as _joints_. In many cases more than two series\r\nof such fractures are found, yet even in these cases two more perfectly\r\ndeveloped series are prominent and almost exactly perpendicular to each\r\nother as well as to the earth’s surface. This omnipresent double series\r\nor _set_ of joints is the well-known set of _master joints_, and very\r\noften it is found developed practically alone (Fig. 36). Over large\r\nareas, the direction of the set of master joints may remain practically\r\nconstant, or this set may quite suddenly give place to a similar set\r\nwhich is, however, turned through half a right angle from the first\r\n(Fig. 37). Not infrequently two such sets of master joints are found\r\ntogether bisecting each other’s angles within the same rocks, and to\r\nthem are sometimes added additional though less perfect series of\r\njoint planes.\r\n\r\nStudied throughout a considerable district, the various series which\r\nmake up these two sets of master joints may be seen locally developed\r\nin different combinations as well as in association with additional\r\nfissure planes which are not easily reduced to any simple law of\r\narrangement (Fig. 38 _a_, _a_, _a_). Only rarely are regular joint\r\nseries observed which do not stand perpendicular to the original\r\nattitude of the rock beds. In a few localities, however, rectangular\r\njoint sets have been discovered which divide the rock into prisms\r\nparallel to the earth’s surface and with the joint series inclined\r\nto it each by half a right angle. Where the rock beds have been much\r\ndisturbed, the complex of joints may be such as to defy all attempts\r\nat orderly arrangement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.—View on the shore at Holstensborg, West\r\nGreenland, to show the subequal spacing of the joints (after Kornerup).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 40.—View of an exposed hillside in Iceland upon which the snow\r\ncollected in crannies along the joints brings out to advantage both\r\nthe larger and the smaller intervals of the joint system (after\r\nThoroddsen).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The space intervals of joints.=—The same kind of subequal spacing\r\nwhich characterizes the fractures near the surface of the block in\r\nDaubrée’s experiment (Fig. 19, p. 41) is found simulated by the rock\r\njoints (Fig. 39). Such unit intervals between fractures may be grouped\r\ntogether into larger units which are separated by fractures of unusual\r\nperfection. We may think of such larger space units as having the\r\nsmaller ones superimposed upon them (Fig. 40).\r\n\r\n\r\n=The displacements upon joints—faults.=—In the vast majority of\r\ncases, the joint fractures when carefully examined betray no evidence\r\nof any appreciable movement of the two walls upon each other. Generally\r\nthe rock layers are seen to cross the joints without apparent\r\ndisplacement. Joints are therefore planes of disjunction only, and not\r\nplanes of displacement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 41.—Faulted blocks of basalt divided by joints near Woodbury,\r\nConnecticut. To show the structure of the rock, some of the foliage has\r\nbeen removed in preparing the sketch from a photograph.]\r\n\r\nWithin many districts, however, a displacement may be seen to have\r\noccurred upon certain of the joint planes, and these are then described\r\nas _faults_. Such displacements of necessity imply a differential\r\nmovement of sections or blocks of the earth’s crust, the so-called\r\n_orographic blocks_, which are bounded by the joint planes and play\r\nindividual rôles in the movement. A simple case of such displacements\r\nin rocks intersected by a single set of master joints is represented\r\nin the model of plate 4 C. The most prominent fault represented by\r\nthis model runs lengthwise through the middle, and the displacement\r\nwhich is measured upon it not only varies between wide limits, but is\r\nmarked by abrupt changes at the margins of the larger blocks. This\r\nvertical displacement upon the fault is called its _throw_. Though not\r\nillustrated by the model, horizontal displacements may likewise occur,\r\nand these will be more fully discussed when the subject of earthquakes\r\nis considered in the following chapter. An actual example of blocks\r\ndisplaced by vertical adjustment is represented in Fig. 41, a simple\r\ntype of faulting which has taken place in rocks but slightly disturbed\r\nfrom their original attitude, but intersected by a relatively simple\r\nsystem of master joints. In those regions where the beds have been\r\nfolded and perhaps overthrust before their elevation into the zone\r\nof fracture, and which are further intersected by disorderly fissure\r\nplanes, the results are far more complex. In such cases the planes of\r\nindividual displacement may not be vertical, though they are generally\r\nsteeper than 45°. For their description it is necessary to make use\r\nof additional technical terms (Fig. 42). The inclination of a sloping\r\nfault plane measured against the vertical is called the _hade_ of\r\nthe fault. The _total displacement_ is measured along the plane of\r\nthe fault from a point upon one limb to the point from which it was\r\nseparated in the other. The additional terms are made sufficiently\r\nclear by the diagram.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 42.—A fault in previously disturbed strata. _AB_, displacement;\r\n_AC_, throw; _BD_, stratigraphic throw; _BC_, heave; angle _CAB_, hade.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Methods of detecting faults.=—The first effect of a fault is\r\nusually to produce a crack at the surface of the earth; and, provided\r\nthere is a vertical displacement or throw, an escarpment which rises\r\nupon the upthrown side of the fault. In general it may be said that\r\nescarpments which appear at the earth’s surface as plane surfaces\r\nprobably represent planes of fracture, though not necessarily planes\r\nof faulting. In many cases the actual displacements lie buried under\r\nloose rock débris near to and paralleling the escarpment, and in some\r\ncases as a result of the erosional processes working upon alternately\r\nhard and soft layers of rock, the escarpment may later appear upon the\r\ndownthrown side or limb of the fault (Fig. 43). As an illustration of a\r\nfault escarpment, the façade of El Capitan and many other rock faces of\r\nthe Yosemite valley may be instanced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 43.—Diagrams to show how an escarpment originally on the upthrown\r\nside of the fault may, through erosion, appear upon the downthrown\r\nside.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 44.—A fault plane exhibiting “drag.” The opening is artificial\r\n(after Scott).]\r\n\r\nWhen we have further studied the erosional processes at the earth’s\r\nsurface, it will be appreciated that faults tend to quickly bury\r\nthemselves from sight, whereas fold structures will long remain in\r\nevidence. Many faults will thus be overlooked, and too great weight\r\nis likely to be ascribed to the folds in accounting for the existing\r\nattitudes and positions of the rock masses. Faults must therefore be\r\nsought out if mistakes of interpretation are to be avoided.\r\n\r\nThe most satisfactory evidence of a fault is the discovery of a\r\nrock bed which may be easily identified, and which is actually seen\r\ndisplaced on a plane of fracture which intersects it (Fig. 42, p. 59).\r\nWhen such an easily recognizable layer is not to be found, the plane\r\nof displacement may perhaps be discovered as a narrow zone composed of\r\nangular fragments of the rock cemented together by minerals which form\r\nout of solution in water. Such a fractured rock zone which follows a\r\nplane of faulting is a _fault breccia_. If the fault breccia, or vein\r\nrock, is much stronger than the rock on either side, it may eventually\r\nstand in relief at the surface like a dike or wall. At other times the\r\ndisplacement produces little fracture of the walls, but they slide over\r\neach other in such a manner as to yield either a smoothly corrugated or\r\nan evenly polished surface which is described as “slickensides.” It may\r\nbe, however, that during the movement either one or both of the walls\r\nhave “dragged”, and so are curled back in the immediate neighborhood of\r\nthe fault plane (Fig. 44).\r\n\r\nWhen, as is quite generally the case, the actual plane of displacement\r\nof a fault is not open to inspection, the movement may be proven by\r\nthe observation of abrupt, as contrasted with gradual, changes in the\r\nstrikes and dips of neighboring exposures (Fig. 45); or by noting\r\nthat some easily recognized formation has been sharply offset in its\r\noutcrops (Fig. 46).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 45.—Map to show how a fault may be indicated in abrupt changes of\r\nthe strike and dip of neighboring exposures.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 46.—A series of parallel faults indicated by successive offsets\r\nin the course of an easily recognizable rock formation.]\r\n\r\nThere are in addition many indications rather than proofs of the\r\npresence of faults, which must be taken account of in every general\r\nstudy of the geology of a district. Thus the outcrops of all\r\nneighboring formations may terminate abruptly upon a straight line\r\nwhich intersects all alike. Deep-seated fissure springs may be aligned\r\nin a striking manner, and so indicate the course of a prominent\r\nfracture, though not necessarily of a fault. Much the same may be said\r\nof the dikes of cooled magma which have been injected along preëxisting\r\nfractures.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The base of the geological map.=—Modern topographic maps form an\r\nimportant part of the library of the serious student of physiography;\r\nthey are the gazetteer of this branch of science. Every civilized\r\nnation has to-day either completed a topographic atlas of its\r\nterritory, or it is vigorously prosecuting a survey to furnish maps\r\nwhich represent the relief with some detail, and publishing the results\r\nin the form of an atlas of quadrangles. Thus a relief map will erelong\r\nbe obtainable of any part of the civilized world, and may be purchased\r\nin separate sections. Nowhere is this work being taken up with greater\r\nvigor than in the United States, where a vast domain representing\r\nevery type of topographic peculiarity is being attacked from many\r\ncenters. Here and elsewhere the relief of the land is being expressed\r\nby so-called contours or lines of equal altitude upon the earth’s\r\nsurface. It is as though a series of horizontal planes, separated by\r\nuniform intervals of 20 or 40 or 100 feet, had been made to intersect\r\nthe surface, and the intersection curves, after consecutive numeration,\r\nhad been dropped into a single plane for printing.\r\n\r\nWhere the slopes are steep, the contour lines in the topographic map\r\nwill appear crowded together and so produce a deep shade upon the map;\r\nwhereas with relatively flat surfaces white patches will stand out\r\nprominently upon the map. More and more the topographic map is coming\r\ninto use, and for the student of nature in particular it is important\r\nto acquire facility in interpreting the relief from the topographic\r\nmap. To further this end, a special model has been devised, and its use\r\nis described in appendix C. Usually before any satisfactory geological\r\nmap can be prepared, a contoured topographic map of the district to be\r\nstudied must be available.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The field map and the areal geological map.=—As the atlas of\r\ntopographic maps is the physiographic gazetteer, so geological maps\r\ntogether constitute the reference dictionary of descriptive geology.\r\nNot only are topographic maps of many districts now generally\r\navailable, but more and more it has become the policy of governments to\r\nsupply geological maps in the same quadrangle form which is the unit\r\nof the topographic map. The geological map is, however, a complex of\r\nso many conventional symbols, that without some practical experience\r\nin the actual preparation of one, it is exceedingly difficult for\r\nthe student to comprehend its significance. A modern geological map\r\nis usually a rectangular sheet printed in color, upon which are many\r\nirregular areas of individual hue joined to each other like the parts\r\nof a child’s picture puzzle.\r\n\r\nThe colored areas upon the geological map are each supposed to indicate\r\nwhere a certain rock type or formation lies immediately below the\r\nsurface, and this distribution represents the best judgment of the\r\ngeologist who, after a study of the district, has prepared the map.\r\nUnfortunately the conventions in use are such that his observation and\r\nhis theory have been hopelessly intermingled in the finished product.\r\nArmed with the geological map, the student who visits the district\r\nfinds spread out before him, it may be, a landscape of hill and valley,\r\nof green forest and brown farming land, which is as different as may be\r\nfrom the colored puzzle which he holds in his hand. Hidden under the\r\nfarm vegetation or masked by the woods are scattered outcroppings of\r\nrock which have been the basis of the geologist’s judgment in preparing\r\nthe map. Experience shows that in order to bridge the wide gap between\r\nthe geology in the landscape and the patches of color upon the map\r\nsomething more than mere examination of the colored sheet is necessary.\r\nWe shall therefore describe, with the aid of laboratory models, the\r\nvarious stages necessary to the preparation of a geological map, and\r\nevery student should be advised to follow this by practical study of\r\nsome small area where rocks are found in outcrop.\r\n\r\nThough the published _areal geological map_ represents both fact and\r\ntheory, the map maker retains an unpublished _field map_ or map of\r\nobservations, upon which the final map has been based. This field map\r\nshows the location of each outcrop that has been studied, with a record\r\nof the kind of rock and of such observations as strike, dip, and pitch.\r\nOur task will therefore be to prepare: (1) a field map; (2) an areal\r\ngeological map; and (3) some typical geological sections.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Laboratory models for the study of geological maps.=—In order to\r\nrepresent in the laboratory the disposition of rock outcrops in the\r\nfield, special laboratory tables are prepared with removable covers\r\nand with fixed tops, which are divided into squares numbered like the\r\ntownship sections of the national domain (Fig. 47). To represent the\r\nrock outcrops, blocks are prepared which may be fixed in any desired\r\nposition by fitting a pin into a small augur hole bored through the\r\ntable. The outcrop blocks for the sedimentary rock types are so\r\nconstructed as to show the strike and dip of the beds. (See Appendix D.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.—Field map prepared from a laboratory table.]\r\n\r\n=The method of preparing the map.=—To prepare the map, use is made of\r\na geological compass with clinometer attachment, a protractor, and a\r\nmap base divided into sections like the top of the table, and on the\r\nscale of one inch to the foot. Each exposure represented upon the table\r\nis “visited” and then located upon the base map in its proper position\r\nand attitude. The result is the field map (Fig. 47), which thus\r\nrepresents the facts only, unless there have been uncertainties in the\r\ncorrelation of exposures or in determining the position of the bedding\r\nplane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.—Areal geological map constructed from the\r\nfield map of Fig. 47, with two selected geological sections.]\r\n\r\nTo prepare the areal geological map from the field map, it is first\r\nnecessary to fix the _boundaries_ which separate formations at the\r\nsurface; and now perhaps for the first time it is realized how large\r\nan element of uncertainty may enter if the exposures were widely\r\nseparated. It is clear that no two persons will draw these lines in\r\nthe same positions throughout, though certain portions of them—where\r\nthe facts are more nearly adequate—may correspond. In Fig. 48 is\r\nrepresented the areal geological map constructed from the field map,\r\nwith the doubtful area at one side left blank.\r\n\r\nSome conclusions from this map may now be profitably considered. The\r\ncomplexly folded sandstone formation at the left of the map appears\r\nas the oldest member represented, since its area has been cut through\r\nby the intrusive granite which does not intrude other formations,\r\nand is unconformably overlaid by the limestone and its basal layer\r\nof conglomerate. The limestone in turn is unconformably overlaid by\r\nthe merely tilted sandstone beds at the right of the map. These three\r\nsedimentary formations clearly represent decreasing amounts of close\r\nfolding, from which it is clear that each earlier formation has passed\r\nthrough an episode not shared by that of next younger age. Of the\r\nother intrusive rocks, the dike of porphyry is younger than all the\r\nother formations, with the possible exception of the upper sandstone.\r\nOffsetting of the formations has disclosed the course of a fault, and\r\nfrom its relations to the dikes we may learn that of these the porphyry\r\nis younger and the basalt older than the date of the faulting.\r\n\r\nThe dashed lines upon the map (_AB_ and _CD_) have been selected as\r\nappropriate lines along which to construct geological sections (Fig.\r\n48, below map), and from these sections the _exposed_ thicknesses of\r\nthe different formations may be calculated. In one instance only,\r\nthat of the conglomerate, can we be sure that this exposed thickness\r\nmeasures the entire formation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fold _versus_ fault topography.=—The more resistant or “stronger”\r\nrock beds, as regards attacks of the atmosphere, in the course of time\r\ncome to stand in relief, separated by depressions which overlie the\r\n“weaker” formations. Simple open folds which are not plunging exercise\r\nan influence upon topography by producing generally long and straight\r\nridges. More complex flexures, since they generally plunge, make\r\nthemselves apparent by features which in the map are represented by\r\ncurves. Fracture structures, and especially block displacements, are\r\ndifferentiated from these curving features by the dominance of straight\r\nor nearly rectilinear lines upon the map. The effect of erosion is to\r\nreduce the asperity of features and to mold them with flowing curves.\r\nThe fracture structures are for this reason much more likely to be\r\noverlooked, and if they are not to elude the observer, they must be\r\nsought out with care. Fold and fracture structures may both be revealed\r\nupon the same map.\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING REFERENCES TO CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n Joint systems:—\r\n\r\n JOHN PHILLIPS.

The terror which\r\nit inspires is no doubt largely to be explained by this disillusionment\r\nfrom the most fundamental of his beliefs. Were he better advised, the\r\nlong periods of quiet which separate earthquakes, and not the lighter\r\nshocks which follow all grander disturbances, would occasion him\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.—View of a portion of the ruins of Messina\r\nafter the earthquake of December 28, 1908.]\r\n\r\nEarthquakes are the sensible manifestations of changes in level or of\r\nlateral adjustments of portions of the continents, and the seismic\r\ndisturbances upon the sea—seaquakes and seismic sea waves—relate to\r\nsimilar changes upon the floor of the ocean.\r\n\r\nDuring the grander or catastrophic earthquakes, the changes are\r\nindeed terrifying, and have usually been accompanied by losses to\r\nlife and property, which are only to be compared with those of great\r\nconflagrations or of inundations on thickly populated plains. The\r\nconflagration has all too frequently been an aftermath of the great\r\nhistoric earthquakes. The earthquake of December 28, 1908, in southern\r\nItaly, destroyed almost the entire population of a great city, and left\r\nof its massive buildings only a confused heap of rubble (Fig. 49). Two\r\nyears later a heavy earthquake resulted in great damage to cities in\r\nCosta Rica (Fig. 50), while two years earlier our own country was first\r\nreally awakened to the danger in which it stands from these convulsive\r\nearth throes; though, as we shall see, these dangers can be largely met\r\nthrough proper methods of construction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 50.—Ruins of the Carnegie Palace of Peace at Cartago, Costa Rica,\r\ndestroyed when almost completed by the great earthquake of May 4, 1910\r\n(after a photograph by Rear-Admiral Singer, U.S.N.).]\r\n\r\nEarthquakes are usually preceded for a brief instant by subterranean\r\nrumblings whose intensity appears to bear no relation to the shocks\r\nwhich follow. The ground then rocks in wavelike motions, which, if of\r\nlarge amplitude, may induce nausea, prevent animals from keeping upon\r\ntheir feet, and wreck all structures not specially adapted to withstand\r\nthem. Heavy bodies are sometimes thrown up from the ground (Fig. 51),\r\nand at other times similar heavy masses are, apparently because of\r\ntheir inertia, more deeply imbedded in the earth. Thus gravestones and\r\nheavy stone posts are often sunk more deeply in the ground and are\r\nsurrounded by a hollow and perhaps by small open cracks in the surface\r\n(Fig. 52). When bodies are thrown upward, it would imply that a quick\r\nupward movement of the ground had been suddenly arrested, while the\r\nburial of heavy bodies in the earth is probably due to a movement which\r\nbegins suddenly and is less abruptly terminated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.—Bowlders thrown into the air and overturned\r\nduring the Assam earthquake of 1897 (after R. D. Oldham).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 52.—Heavy post sunk deeper into the ground during the Charleston\r\nearthquake of August 31, 1886 (after Dutton).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Seaquakes and seismic sea waves.=—Upon the ocean the quakes which\r\nemanate from the sea floor are felt on shipboard as sudden joltings\r\nwhich produce the impression that the ship has struck upon a shoal,\r\nthough in most instances there is no visible commotion in the\r\nwater. The distribution of these shocks, as indicated either by the\r\nexperiences of neighboring ships at the time of a particular shock, or\r\nby the records of vessels which at different times have sailed over an\r\narea of frequent seismic disturbance, appears to be limited to narrow\r\nzones or lines (Fig. 53). The same tendency of under-sea disturbances\r\nto be localized upon definite straight lines has been often illustrated\r\nby the behavior of deep-sea cables which are laid in proximity to one\r\nanother and which have been known to part simultaneously at points\r\nranged upon a straight line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 53.—Map showing the localities at which shocks have been reported\r\nat sea off Cape Mendocino, California.]\r\n\r\nFar grander disturbances upon the floor of the ocean have been revealed\r\nby the great sea waves—the so-called “tidal waves”, properly referred\r\nto as _tsunamis_—which recur in those sea districts which adjoin the\r\nspecial earthquake zones upon the continents (p. 86). The forerunner of\r\nsuch a sea wave approaching the shore is usually a sudden withdrawal\r\nof the water so as to lay bare a portion of the bottom, but this is\r\nwell-recognized to be the premonition of a gigantic oncoming wave\r\nwhich sweeps all before it and is only halted when it has rolled over\r\nall the low-lying country and encountered a mountain wall. Such\r\nseismic waves have been especially common upon the Pacific shore of\r\nSouth America and upon the Japanese littoral (Fig. 54). These waves\r\nproceed from above the great deeps upon the ocean bottom, and clearly\r\nresult from the grander earth movements to which these depressions owe\r\ntheir exceptional depth. The withdrawal of the water from neighboring\r\nshores may be presumed to be connected with a descent of the floor\r\nof the depression and the consequent drawing-in of the ocean surface\r\nabove. The later high wave would thus represent the dispersion of the\r\nmountain of water which is raised by the meeting of the waters from the\r\ndifferent sides of the depression.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.—Effect of a seismic water wave at Kamaishi,\r\nJapan, in 1896 (after E. R. Scidmore).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.—A fault of vertical displacement.]\r\n\r\n=The grander and the lesser earth movements.=—Upon the land the\r\ngrander and so-called catastrophic earthquakes are usually the\r\naccompaniment of important changes in the surface of the ground that\r\nwill be discussed in later sections. Those shocks which do little\r\ndamage to structures produce no visible changes in the earth’s surface,\r\nexcept, it may be, to shake down some water-soaked masses of earth upon\r\nthe steeper slopes. Still other movements, and these too slight to be\r\nfelt even in the night when the animal world is at rest, may yet be\r\ndistinguished by their sounds, the unmistakable rumblings which are\r\ncharacteristic alike of the heaviest and the lightest of earthquake\r\nshocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 56.—Escarpment produced by an earthquake fault of vertical\r\ndisplacement which cut across the Chedrang River and thus produced a\r\nwaterfall, Assam earthquake of 1897 (after R. D. Oldham).]\r\n\r\n=Changes in the earth’s surface during earthquakes—faults and\r\nfissures.=—Each of the grander among historic earthquakes has been\r\naccompanied by noteworthy changes in the configuration of the earth’s\r\nsurface within the district where the shocks were most intense. A\r\nsection of the ground is usually found to have moved with reference\r\nto another upon the other side of a vertical plane which is usually\r\nto be seen; we have here to do with the actual making of a fault\r\nor displacement such as we find the fossil examples of within the\r\nrocks. The displacement, or throw, upon the fault plane may be either\r\nupward or downward or laterally in one direction or the other, or\r\nthese movements may be combined. A movement of adjacent sections of\r\nthe ground upward or downward with reference to each other (Fig. 55)\r\nhas been often observed, notably at Midori after the great Japanese\r\nearthquake of 1891, and in the Chedrang valley of Assam after the\r\nearthquake of 1897 (Fig. 56).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.—A fault of lateral displacement.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 58.—Fence parted and displaced fifteen feet by a transverse fault\r\nformed during the California earthquake of 1906 (after W. B. Scott).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 59.—Fault with vertical and lateral displacements combined.]\r\n\r\nA lateral throw, unaccompanied by appreciable vertical displacement\r\n(Fig. 57), is especially well illustrated by the fault in California\r\nwhich was formed during the earthquake of 1906 (Fig. 58). A combination\r\nof the two types of displacement in one (Fig. 59) is exemplified by the\r\nBaishiko fault of Formosa at the place shown in plate 3 A.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The measure of displacement.=—To afford some measure of the\r\ndisplacements which have been observed upon earthquake faults, it may\r\nbe stated that the maximum vertical throw measured upon the fault in\r\nthe Neo valley of Japan (1891) was 18 feet, in the Chedrang valley of\r\nAssam (1897) 35 feet, and of the Alaskan coast (1899) 47 feet. Large\r\nsections of land were bodily uplifted in these cases within the space\r\nof a few seconds, or at most a few minutes, by the amounts given. The\r\nlargest recorded lateral displacement measured upon an earthquake fault\r\nis about 21 feet upon the California rift after the earthquake of 1906;\r\nthough an amount only slightly less than this is indicated in the\r\nshifting of roads and arroyas dating from the earthquake of 1872 in the\r\nOwens valley, California. Fault lines once established are planes of\r\nspecial weakness and become later the seat of repeated movements of the\r\nsame kind.\r\n\r\n┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n│  PLATE 3.                                                            │\r\n│                                                                      │\r\n│ [Illustration: _A._ An earthquake fault opened in Formosa in 1906,   │\r\n│ with vertical and lateral displacements combined (after Omori).]     │\r\n│                                                                      │\r\n│ [Illustration: _B._ Earthquake faults opened in Alaska in 1889, on   │\r\n│ which vertical slices of the earth’s shell have undergone individual │\r\n│ adjustments (after Tarr and Martin).]                                │\r\n└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 60.—Diagram to show how small faults in the rock basement may be\r\nmasked at the surface through adjustments within the loose rock mantle.]\r\n\r\nThe greater number of earthquake faults are found in the loose rock\r\ncover which so generally mantles the firmer rock basement, and it is\r\nalmost certain that the throws within the solid rock are considerably\r\nlarger than those which are here measured at the surface, owing to\r\nthe adjustments which so readily take place in the looser materials.\r\nThose lighter shocks of earthquake which are accompanied by no visible\r\ndisplacements at the surface do, however, in some instances affect\r\nin a measure the flow of water upon the surface, and thus indicate\r\nthat small changes of surface level have occurred without breaks\r\nsufficiently sharp to be perceived (Fig. 60). Intermediate between the\r\nsteep escarpment and the masked displacement just described is the\r\nso-called “mole-hill” effect,—a rounded and variously cracked slope or\r\nridge above the position of a buried fault (Fig. 61).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 61.—Diagram to show the appearance of a “mole hill” above a\r\nburied earthquake fault (after Kotô).]\r\n\r\nThe escarpments due to earthquake faults in loose materials at the\r\nearth’s surface can obviously retain their steepness for a few years\r\nor decades at the most; for because of their verticality they must\r\ngradually disappear in rounded slopes under the action of the elements.\r\nSmaller displacements within a rock which rapidly disintegrates under\r\nthe action of frost and sun will likewise before long be effaced. In\r\nthose exceptional instances where a resistant rock type has had all\r\naltered upper layers planed away until a fresh and hard surface is\r\nexposed, and has further been protected from the frost and sun beneath\r\na thin layer of soil, its original surface may be retained unaltered\r\nfor many centuries. Upon such a surface the lightest of sensible\r\nshocks, or even the smaller earth movements which are not perceived\r\nat the time, may leave an almost indelible record. Such records\r\nparticularly show that the movements which they register occur upon the\r\nplanes of jointing within the rock, and that these ready formed cracks\r\nhave probably been the seats of repeated and cumulative adjustments\r\n(Fig. 62).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 62.—Post-glacial earthquake faults of small but cumulative\r\ndisplacement, eastern New York (after Woodworth).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.—Earthquake cracks in Colorado desert (after a\r\nphotograph by Sauerven).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Contraction of the earth’s surface during earthquakes.=—The wide\r\nvariations in the amount of the lateral displacement upon earthquake\r\nfaults, like those opened in California in 1906, show that at the\r\ntime of a heavy earthquake there must be large local changes in the\r\ndensity of the surface materials. Literally, thousands of fissures may\r\nappear in the lowlands, many of them no doubt a secondary effect of\r\nthe shaking, but others, like the _quebradas_ of the southern Andes or\r\nthe “earthquake cracks” in the Colorado desert (Fig. 63), may have a\r\ndeeper-seated origin. Many facts go to show, however, that though local\r\nexpansion does occur in some localities, a surface contraction is a\r\nfar more general consequence of earth movement. In civilized countries\r\nof high industrial development, where lines of metal of one kind or\r\nanother run for long distances beneath or upon the surface of the\r\nground, such general contraction of the surface may be easily proven.\r\nComparatively seldom are lines of metal pulled apart in such a way as\r\nto show an expansion of the surface; whereas bucklings and kinkings of\r\nthe lines appear in many places to prove that the area within which\r\nthey are found has, as a whole, been reduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.—Diagrams to show how railway tracks are either\r\nbroken or buckled locally within the district visited by an earthquake.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.—The Biwajima railroad bridge in Japan after\r\nthe earthquake of 1891 (after Milne and Burton).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 66.—Diagrams to show how the compression of a district and its\r\nconsequent contraction during an earthquake may close up the joint\r\nspaces within the rock basement and concentrate the contraction of the\r\noverlying mantle where this is partially cut through and so weakened in\r\nthe valley sections.]\r\n\r\nWater pipes laid in the ground at a depth of some feet may be bowed up\r\ninto an arch which appears above the surface; lines of curbing are\r\nraised into broken arches, and the tracks of railways are thrown into\r\nlocal loops and kinks which imply a very considerable local contraction\r\nof the surface (Fig. 64). With unvarying regularity railway or other\r\nbridges which cross rivers or ravines, if the structures are seriously\r\ndamaged, indicate that the river banks have drawn nearer together at\r\nthe time of the disturbance. In such cases, whenever the bridge girder\r\nhas remained in place upon its abutments, these have either been broken\r\nor back-tilted as a whole in such a manner as to indicate an approach\r\nof the foundations which was prevented at the top by the stiffness of\r\nthe girder (Fig. 65).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 67.—Map of the Chedrang fault which made its appearance during\r\nthe Assam earthquake of 1897. The figures give the amounts of the local\r\nvertical displacement measured in feet (after R. D. Oldham).]\r\n\r\nThe simplest explanation of such an approach of the banks at the\r\nsides of the valleys cut in loose surface material is to be found in\r\na general closing up of the joint spaces within the underlying rock,\r\nand an adjustment of the mantle upon the floor mainly in the valley\r\nsections (Fig. 66).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 68.—Map giving the displacements in feet measured along an\r\nearthquake fault formed in Alaska in 1899 (after Tarr and Martin).]\r\n\r\n=The plan of an earthquake fault.=—In our consideration of earthquake\r\nfaults we have thus far given our attention to the displacement as\r\nviewed at a single locality only. Such displacements are, however,\r\ncontinued for many miles, and sometimes for hundreds of miles; and when\r\nnow we examine a map or plan of such a line of faulting, new facts of\r\nlarge significance make their appearance. This may be well illustrated\r\nby a study of the plan of the Chedrang fault which appeared at the\r\ntime of the Assam earthquake of 1897 (Fig. 67). From this map it\r\nwill be noticed that the upward or downward displacement upon the\r\nperpendicular plane of the fault is not uniform, but is subject to\r\nlarge and _sudden_ changes. Thus in order the measurements in feet are\r\n32, 0, 18, 35, 0, 8, 25, 12, 8, 2, 0. The fault formed in 1899 upon\r\nthe shores of Russell Fjord in Alaska (Fig. 68) reveals similar sudden\r\nchanges of throw, only that here the direction of the movement is often\r\nreversed; or, otherwise expressed, the upthrow is suddenly transferred\r\nfrom one side of the fault to the other. Such abrupt changes in the\r\ndirection of the displacement have been observed upon many earthquake\r\nfaults, and a particularly striking one is represented in Fig. 69.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 69.—Abrupt change in the direction of throw upon an earthquake\r\nfault which was formed in the Owens valley, California, in 1872. The\r\nobserver looks directly along the course of the fault from the left\r\nforeground to the cliff beyond and to the left of the impounded water\r\n(after a photograph by W. D. Johnson).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The block movements of the disturbed district.=—The displacements\r\nupon earthquake faults are thus seen to be subdivided into sections,\r\neach of which differs from its neighbors upon either side and is\r\nsharply separated from them, at least in many instances. These points\r\nof abrupt change of displacement are, in many cases at least, the\r\nintersection points with transverse faults (Fig. 69). Such points of\r\nabrupt change in the degree or in the direction of the displacement may\r\nbe, when looked at from above, abrupt turning points in the direction\r\nof extension of the fault, whose course upon the map appears as a\r\nzigzag line made up of straight sections connected by sharp elbows\r\n(Fig. 70).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 70.—Map of the faults within an area of the Owens valley,\r\nCalifornia, formed in part during the earthquake of 1872, and in part\r\ndue to early disturbances, In the western portions the displacements\r\ncut across firm rock and alluvial deposits alike without deviation of\r\ndirection (after a map by W. D. Johnson).]\r\n\r\nSuch a grouping of surface faults as are represented upon the map is\r\nevidence that the area of the earth’s shell, which is included, has at\r\nthe time of the earthquake been subject to adjustments as a series of\r\nseparate units or blocks, certain of the boundaries of which are the\r\nfault lines represented. The changes in displacement measured upon the\r\nlarger faults make it clear that the observed faults can represent but\r\na fraction of the total number of lines of displacement, the others\r\nbeing masked by variations in the compactness of the loose mantling\r\ndeposits. Could we but have this mantle removed, we should doubtless\r\nfind a rock floor separated into parts like an ancient Pompeiian\r\npavement, the individual blocks in which have been thrown, some upward\r\nand some downward, by varying amounts. Less than a hundred miles away\r\nto the eastward from the Owens Valley, a portion of this pavement has\r\nbeen uncovered in the extensive operations of the Tonapah Mining\r\nDistrict, so that there we may study in all its detail the elaborate\r\npattern of earth marquetry (Fig. 71) which for the floor of the Owens\r\nvalley is as yet denied us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 71.—Marquetry of the rock floor of the Tonapah Mining District,\r\nNevada (after Spurr).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 72.—Map of a portion of the Alaskan coast to show the adjustments\r\nin level during the earthquake of 1899 (after Tarr and Martin).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The earth blocks adjusted during the Alaskan earthquake of 1899.=—For\r\na study of the adjustments which take place between neighboring earth\r\nblocks during a great earthquake, the recent Alaskan disturbance\r\nhas offered the advantage that the most affected district was upon\r\nthe seacoast, where changes of level could be referred to the datum\r\nof the sea’s surface. Here a great island and large sections of the\r\nneighboring shore underwent movements both as a whole in large blocks\r\nand in adjustments of their subordinate parts among themselves (Fig.\r\n72). Some sections of the coast were here elevated by as much as 47\r\nfeet, while neighboring sections were uplifted by smaller amounts (Fig.\r\n73), and certain smaller sections were even dropped below the level\r\nof the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 73.—View on Haencke Island, Disenchantment Bay, Alaska, revealing\r\nthe shore that rose seventeen feet above the sea during the earthquake\r\nof 1899, and was found with barnacles still clinging to the rock (after\r\nTarr and Martin).]\r\n\r\nThe amount of such subsidence is, however, difficult\r\nto ascertain, for the reason that the former shore features are now\r\ncovered with water and thus removed from observation. In favorable\r\nlocalities the minimum amount of submergence may sometimes be measured\r\nupon forest trees which are now flooded with sea water. In Fig. 74\r\na portion of the coast is represented where the beach sand is now\r\nextended back into the spruce forest, a distance of a hundred feet or\r\nmore, and where sedgy beach grass is growing among trees whose roots\r\nare now laved in salt water. At the front of this forest the great\r\nstorm waves overturn the trees and pile the wreckage in front of those\r\nthat still remain standing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 74.—Partially submerged forest upon the shore of Knight Island,\r\nAlaska, due to the sinking of a section of the coast during the\r\nearthquake of 1899 (after Tarr and Martin).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 75.—Settlement of a section of the shore at Port Royal, Jamaica,\r\nduring the earthquake of January 14, 1907, adjacent to a similar but\r\nlarger settlement of the near shore during the earthquake of 1692\r\n(after a photograph by Brown).]\r\n\r\nUpon the glaciated rock surfaces of the Alaskan coast, exceptionally\r\nfavorable opportunities are found for study of the intricate pattern\r\nof the earth mosaic which is under adjustment at the time of an\r\nearthquake. Upon Gannett Nunatak the surface was found divided by\r\nparallel faults into distinct slices which individually underwent small\r\nchanges of level (plate 3 B).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE INTERRUPTED CHARACTER OF EARTH MOVEMENTS: EARTHQUAKES AND SEAQUAKES\r\n(Concluded)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Experimental demonstration of earth movements.=—The study of the\r\nAlaskan earthquake of 1899 showed that during this adjustment within\r\nthe earth’s shell some of the local blocks moved upward and by larger\r\namounts than their neighbors, and that still others were actually\r\ndepressed so that the sea flowed over them. It must be evident that\r\nsuch differential vertical movements of neighboring blocks at the\r\nearth’s surface can only take place if lateral transfers of material\r\nare made beneath it. From under those strips of coast land which were\r\ndepressed, material must have been moved so as to fill the void which\r\nwould otherwise have formed beneath the sections that were uplifted.\r\nIf we take into consideration much larger fractions upon the surface\r\nof our planet, we are taught by the great seaquakes which are now\r\nregistered upon earthquake instruments at distant stations that large\r\n_downward_ movements are to-day in progress beneath the sea much more\r\nthan sufficient to compensate all extensions of the earth’s surface\r\nwithin those districts where the land is rising in mountains. From\r\nunder the offshore deeps of the ocean to beneath the growing mountains\r\nupon the shore, a transfer of earth material must be assumed to take\r\nplace when disturbances are registered.\r\n\r\nWithin the time interval that separates the sudden adjustments of\r\nthe surface which are manifested in earthquakes, the condition of\r\nstrain which brings them about is steadily accumulating, due, as we\r\ngenerally assume, to earth contraction through loss of its heat. It\r\nseems probable that the resistance to an immediate adjustment is found\r\nin the rigidity of the shell because of the compression to which it is\r\nsubjected. To illustrate: a row of blocks well fitted to each other\r\nmay be held firmly as a bridge between the jaws of a vice, because so\r\nsoon as each block starts to fall a large resistance from friction upon\r\nits surface is called into existence, a force which increases with the\r\ndegree of compression.\r\n\r\nIt is thus possible upon this assumption crudely to demonstrate the\r\nadjustment of earth blocks by the simple device represented in plate\r\n4 A. The construction of this experimental tank is so simple that\r\nlittle explanation is necessary. Wooden blocks of different heights\r\nare supported in water within a tank having a glass front, and are\r\nkept in a strained condition at other than their natural positions of\r\nflotation by the compression of a simple vice at the top. Held firmly\r\nin this position, they may thus represent the neighboring blocks within\r\nthe earth’s outer shell which are supported upon relatively yielding\r\nmaterials beneath, and prevented from at once adjusting themselves\r\nto their natural positions through the compression to which they are\r\nsubjected. Held as they now are, the water near the ends of the tank\r\nis forced up beneath the blocks to higher than its natural level, and\r\nthus tends to flow from both ends toward the center. Such a movement\r\nwould permit the end blocks to drop and force the middle ones to rise.\r\nThe end blocks are, let us say, the sections of Alaskan coast line\r\nwhich sunk during the earthquake, as the center blocks are the sections\r\nwhich rose the full measure of 47 feet. Upon a larger scale the end\r\nblocks may equally well be considered as the floor of the great deeps\r\noff the Alaskan coast, whose sinking at the time of the earthquake was\r\nthe cause of the great sea wave. Upon this assumption the center blocks\r\nwould represent the Alaskan coast regarded as a whole, which underwent\r\na general uplift.\r\n\r\nThough we may not, in our experiment, vary the tendency to adjustment\r\nby any contractional changes in either the water or the blocks, we may\r\nreduce the compression of the vice, which leads to the same general\r\nresult. As the compression of the vice is slowly relaxed, a point is\r\nat last reached at which friction upon the block surfaces is no longer\r\nsufficient to prevent an adjustment taking place, and this now suddenly\r\noccurs with the result shown in plate 4 B. In the case of the earth\r\nblocks, this sudden adjustment is accompanied by mass movements of the\r\nground separated by faults, and these movements produce successional\r\nvibrations that are particularly large near the block margins, and\r\nother frictional vibrations of such small measure as to be generally\r\nappreciated by sounds only. The jolt of the adjustments has thrown some\r\nblocks beyond their natural position of rest, and these sink and rise\r\nsubsequently in order to readjust themselves with lighter vibrations,\r\nwhich may be repeated and continued for some time. In the case of the\r\nearth these later adjustments are the so-called _aftershocks_ which\r\nusually continue throughout a considerable period following every great\r\nearthquake. Gradually they fall off in intensity and frequency until\r\nthey can no longer be felt, and are thereafter continued for a time as\r\nrumblings only.\r\n\r\n\r\n┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n│  PLATE 4.                                                             │\r\n│                                                                       │\r\n│ [Illustration:                                                        │\r\n│                                                                       │\r\n│ _A._ Experimental tank to illustrate the earth movements which are    │\r\n│ manifested in earthquakes.

At the instant when adjustment takes place in the tank,\r\nwater frequently spurts upward from the cracks between the sinking end\r\nblocks; and if in place of one of the higher center blocks we insert\r\none whose top is below the level of the water in the tank, a “lake”\r\nwill be formed above it. When the adjustment occurs, this lake is\r\nimmediately drained by outflow of the water at its bottom along one of\r\nthe cracks between the blocks (Fig. 76).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 76.—Diagrams to illustrate the draining of lakes during\r\nearthquakes.]\r\n\r\nSuch derangements of water flow as have been illustrated by the\r\nexperiment are among the commonest of the phenomena which accompany\r\nearthquakes. Lakes and swamp lands have during earthquakes been\r\nsuddenly drained, fountains of water have been seen to shoot up\r\nfrom the surface and have played for some minutes or hours before\r\ntheir sudden disappearance in a sucking down of the water with later\r\nreadjustment. During the great earthquake of the lower Mississippi\r\nvalley in 1811, known as the New Madrid earthquake, the earlier Lake\r\nEulalie was completely drained, and upon the now exposed bed there\r\nappeared parallel fissures on which were ranged funnel-like openings\r\ndown which the water had been sucked. In other sections of the affected\r\nregion the water shot up in sheets along fissures to the tops of high\r\ntrees. Areas where such spurting up of the water has been observed have\r\nin most cases been shown to correspond to areas of depression, and such\r\nareas have sometimes been left flooded with water. During the Indian\r\nearthquake of 1819 an area of some 200 square miles suddenly sank and\r\nwas transformed into a lake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 77.—Diagram to illustrate-the derangements of flow of water at\r\nthe time of an earthquake; water issuing at the surface over downthrown\r\nrocks, and being sucked down in upthrown blocks.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 78.—Mud cones aligned upon a fissure opened at Moraza, Servia,\r\nduring the earthquake of April 4, 1904 (after Michailovitch).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sand or mud cones and craterlets.=—From a very moderate depth below\r\nthe surface to that of several miles, all pore spaces and all larger\r\nopenings within the rock are completely filled with water, the “trunk\r\nlines” of whose circulation is by way of the joints or along the\r\nbedding planes of the rocks. The principal reservoirs, so to speak, of\r\nthis water inclosed within the rock are the porous sand formations.\r\nWhen, now, during an earthquake a block of the earth’s shell is\r\nsuddenly sunk and as suddenly arrested in its downward movement, the\r\neffect is to compress the porous layers and so force the contained\r\nwater upward along the joints to the surface, carrying with it large\r\nquantities of the sand (Fig. 77).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 79.—One of the many craterlets formed near Charleston, South\r\nCarolina, during the earthquake of August 31, 1886. The opening is\r\ntwenty feet across, and the leaves about it are encased in sand as were\r\nthose upon the branches of the overhanging trees to a height of some\r\ntwenty feet (after Dutton).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 80.—Cross section of a craterlet to show the trumpet-like form of\r\nthe sand column.]\r\n\r\nEjected at the surface this water appears in fountains usually arranged\r\nin line over joints, or even in continuous sheets, and the sand\r\ncollecting about the jets builds up lines of _sand_ or _mud cones_\r\nsometimes described as “mud volcanoes” (Fig. 78). The amount of sand\r\nthus poured out is sometimes so great that blankets of quicksand are\r\nspread over large sections of the country. Most frequently, however,\r\nthe sand is not built above the general level of the surface, but forms\r\na series of _craterlets_ which are largely shaped as the water is\r\nsucked down at the time of the readjustment with which the play of such\r\nearthquake fountains is terminated (Fig. 79). Subsequent excavations\r\nmade about such craterlets have shown them to have the form of a\r\ntrumpet, and that in the sand which so largely fills them there are\r\ngenerally found scales of mica and such light bodies as would be picked\r\nout from the heterogeneous materials of the sand layers and carried\r\nupward in the rush of water to the surface (Fig. 80).\r\n\r\n\r\n=The earth’s zones of heavy earthquake.=—Since earthquakes give notice\r\nof a change of level of the ground, the special danger zones from this\r\nsource are the growing mountain systems which are usually found near\r\nthe borders of the sea. Such lines of mountains are to-day rising where\r\nfor long periods in the past were the basins of deposition of former\r\nseas. They thus represent the zones upon the earth’s surface which\r\nare the most unstable—which in the recent period have undergone the\r\ngreatest changes of level.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 81.—Map of the island of Ischia to show how the shocks of recent\r\nearthquakes have been concentrated at the crossing point of two\r\nfractures (after Mercalli and Johnston-Lavis).]\r\n\r\nBy far the most unstable belt upon the earth’s surface is the rim\r\nsurrounding the Pacific Ocean, within which margin it has been\r\nestimated that about 54 per cent of the recorded shocks of earthquake\r\nhave occurred. Next in importance for seismic instability is the\r\nzone which borders both the Mediterranean Sea and the Caribbean—the\r\nAmerican Mediterranean—and is extended across central Asia through\r\nthe Himalayas into Malaysia. Both zones approximate to great circles\r\nupon the earth’s surface and intersect each other at an angle of about\r\n67°. It has been estimated that about 95 per cent of the recorded\r\ncontinental earthquakes have emanated from these belts.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 82.—A line of earth fracture indicated in the plan of the relief,\r\nwhich may at any time become the seat of movement and resultant shock.]\r\n\r\n=The special lines of heavy shock.=—Within any earthquake district\r\nthe shocks are not felt with equal severity at all places, but there\r\nare, on the contrary, definite lines which the disturbance seems to\r\nsearch out for special damage. From their relations to the relief of\r\nthe land these lines would appear to be lines of fracture upon the\r\nboundaries of those sections of the crust that play individual rôles in\r\nthe block adjustment which takes place. More or less masked as these\r\nlines are beneath the rounded curves of the landscape, they are given\r\nan altogether unenviable prominence with each succeeding earthquake. At\r\nsuch times we may think of the earth’s surface as specially sensitized\r\nfor laying bare its hidden structure, as is the sensitized plate under\r\nthe magical influence of the X rays.\r\n\r\nWhen, at the time of an earthquake, blocks are adjusted with reference\r\nto their neighbors, the movements of oscillation are greatest in\r\nthose marginal portions of direct contact. Corners of blocks—the\r\nintersecting points of the important faults—should for the same\r\nreason be shaken with a double violence, and this assumption appears\r\nto be confirmed by observation. Upon the island of Ischia, off the\r\nBay of Naples, the shocks from recent earthquakes have been strangely\r\nconcentrated near the town of Casamicciola, which was last destroyed\r\nin 1883. This unfortunate city lies at the crossing point of important\r\nfractures whose course upon the island is marked by numerous springs\r\nand _suffioni_ (Fig. 81).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Seismotectonic lines.=—The lines of important earth fractures, as\r\nwill be more clearly shown in the sequel (p. 227), are often indicated\r\nwith some clearness by straight lines in the plan of the surface\r\nrelief (Fig. 82). Lines of this nature are easily made out upon\r\nthe map of the West Indies, and if we represent upon it by circles\r\nof different diameters the combined intensities of the recorded\r\nearthquakes in the various cities, it appears that the heavily shaken\r\nlocalities are ranged upon lines stamped out in the relief, with\r\nthe most severely damaged places at their intersections (Fig. 83).\r\nThese lines of exceptional instability are known as _seismotectonic\r\nlines_—earthquake structure lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.—Seismotectonic lines of the West Indies.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The heavy shocks above loose foundations.=—It is characteristic of\r\nfaults that they soon bury themselves from sight under loose materials,\r\nand are thus made difficult of inspection. The escarpment which is the\r\ndirect consequence of a vertical displacement upon a fault tends to\r\nmigrate from the place of its formation, rounding the surface as it\r\ndoes so and burying the fault line beneath its deposits (Fig. 43, p.\r\n60).\r\n\r\nThis is not, however, the sole reason why loose foundations should be\r\nplaces of special danger at the time of earth shocks, for the reason\r\nthat earthquake waves are sent out in all directions from the surfaces\r\nof displacement through the medium of the underlying rock. These\r\nwaves travel within the firm rock for considerable distances with\r\nonly a gradual dissipation of their energy, but with their entry into\r\nthe loose surface deposits their energy is quickly used up in local\r\nvibrations of large amplitude, and hence destructive to buildings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 84.—Device to illustrate the different effects upon the\r\ntransmission and the character of shocks which are produced by firm\r\nrock and by loose materials.]\r\n\r\nThe essential difference between firm rock and such loose materials as\r\nare found upon a river bottom or in the “made land” about our cities\r\nmay be illustrated by the simple device which is represented in Fig.\r\n84. Two similar metal pans are suspended from a firm support by bands\r\nof steel and “elastic” braid of similar size and shape, and carry each\r\na small block of wood standing upon its end. Similar light blows are\r\nnow administered directly to the pans with the effect of upsetting that\r\nblock which is supported by the loose braid because of the large range\r\nor amplitude of movement that is imparted to the pan. The “elastic”\r\nbraid, because of these large vibrations of which it is susceptible,\r\nmay represent the loose materials when an earthquake wave passes into\r\nthem. In the case of the steel support, the energy of the blow, instead\r\nof being dissipated in local swingings of the pan, is to a large extent\r\ntransmitted through the elastic metal to materials beyond. The steel\r\nthus resembles in its high elasticity the firmer rock basement, which\r\nreceives and transmits the earthquake shocks, but except when ruptured\r\nin a fault is subject to vibrations of small amplitude only.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Construction in earthquake regions.=—Wherever earthquakes have\r\nbeen felt, they are certain to occur again; and wherever mountains\r\nare growing or changes of level are in progress, there no record of\r\npast earthquakes is required in order to forecast the future seismic\r\nhistory. Although the future earthquakes may be predicted, the time of\r\ntheir coming is, fortunately or unfortunately, still hidden from us. If\r\none’s lot is to be cast in an earthquake country, the only sane course\r\nto pursue is to build with due regard to future contingencies.\r\n\r\nThe danger, from destructive fires may to-day be largely met by methods\r\nof construction which levy an additional burden of cost. Though the\r\ndanger from seismic disturbances can hardly be met as fully as that\r\nfrom fire, yet it is true that buildings may be so constructed as to\r\nwithstand all save those heaviest shocks in the immediate vicinity of\r\nthe lines of large displacement. Here, also, a considerable additional\r\nexpense is involved in the method of construction, in the case of\r\nresidences particularly.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said, it is obvious that much of the danger from\r\nearthquakes can be met by a choice of site away from lines of important\r\nfracture and from areas of relatively loose foundation. The choice of\r\nbuilding materials is next of importance. Those buildings which succumb\r\nto earthquakes are in most cases racked or shaken apart, and thus they\r\nbecome a prey to their own inherent properties of inertia. Each part of\r\na structure may be regarded as a weight which is balanced upon a stiff\r\nrod and pivoted upon the ground. When shocks arrive, each part tends\r\nto be thrown into vibration after the manner of an inverted pendulum.\r\nIn proportion, therefore, as the weights are large and rest upon long\r\nsupports, the danger of overthrow and of tearing apart is increased.\r\nIn general, structures are best constructed of light materials whose\r\nweight is concentrated near the ground. Masonry structures, and\r\nespecially high ones, are, therefore, the least suited for resisting\r\nearthquakes, of which the late complete destruction of the city of\r\nMessina is a grewsome reminder. Despite repeated warnings in the past,\r\nthe buildings of that stricken city were generally constructed of heavy\r\nrubble, which in addition had been poorly cemented (Fig. 49, p. 67).\r\nSuch structures are usually first ruptured at the edges and corners,\r\nsince here the vibrations which tend to tear the building asunder are\r\nresisted by no supports and are reënforced from neighboring walls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 85.—House wrecked in San Francisco earthquake of 1906 because the\r\nfloors and partitions were not securely fastened to the walls (after R.\r\nL. Humphrey).]\r\n\r\nAn advantage of the first importance is evidently secured if the rods\r\nof the pendulum, of which the building is conceived to be composed,\r\nhave sufficient elasticity to be considerably distorted without\r\nrupture and to again recover their original position. This is the\r\nsupreme advantage of structural steel for all large buildings, which\r\nis coupled, however, with the disadvantage that the riveted fastenings\r\nare apt to be quickly sheered off under the vibrations. Large and high\r\nbuildings, when sufficiently elastic, have fortunately the property of\r\ndestroying the earth waves by interference before they have traveled\r\nabove the lower stories.\r\n\r\nFor large structures in which wood cannot be used, strongly reënforced\r\nconcrete is well adapted, for it has in general the same advantages\r\nas steel with somewhat reduced elasticity, but with a more effective\r\nbinding together of the parts. This requirement of thorough bracing\r\nand tying together of the several parts of a building causes it to\r\nvibrate, not as many pendulums, but as one body. If met, it removes\r\nlargely the danger from racking strains, and for small structures\r\nparticularly it is the requirement which is most easily complied with.\r\nFor such buildings it is therefore necessary that the framework should\r\nbe built in a close network with every joint firmly braced and with\r\nall parts securely tied together. Especial attention should be given\r\nto the fastenings of floor and partition ends. The house shown in Fig.\r\n85 could not have been subjected to heavy shocks, for though the walls\r\nare thrown down, the floors and partitions have been left near their\r\noriginal positions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 86.—Building wrecked at San Mateo, California, during the late\r\nearthquake. The heavy roof and upper floor, acting as a unit, have\r\nbattered down the upper walls (after J. C. Branner).]\r\n\r\nThis tendency of the walls, floors, partitions, and roof to act as\r\nindividual units in the vibration, is one that must be reckoned with\r\nand be met by specially effective bracing and tying at the junctions.\r\nOtherwise these larger parts of the structure may act like battering\r\nrams to throw over the walls or portions of them (Fig. 86).\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING REFERENCES FOR CHAPTERS VII AND VIII\r\n\r\n General works:—\r\n\r\n JOHN MILNE.

The best introduction\r\nto a discussion of volcanoes is, therefore, a disillusionment from\r\nthis notion. Far from being burning or smoking, there is normally\r\nno combustion whatever in connection with a volcanic eruption. The\r\nunsophisticated tourist who, looking out from Naples, sees the steam\r\ncap which overhangs the Vesuvian crater tinged with brown, easily\r\nreceives the impression that the material of the cloud is smoke. Even\r\nmore at night, when a bright glow is reflected to his eye and soon\r\nfades away, only to again glow brightly after a few moments have\r\npassed, is it difficult to remove the impression that one is watching\r\nan intermittent combustion within the crater. The cloud which floats\r\naway from the crest of the mountain is in reality composed of steam\r\nwith which is admixed a larger or smaller proportion of fine rock\r\npowder which gives to the cloud its brownish tone. The glow observed at\r\nnight is only a reflection from molten lava within the crater, and the\r\nvariation of its brightness is explained by the alternating rise and\r\nfall of the lava surface by a process presently to be explained.\r\n\r\nNot only is there no combustion in connection with volcanic eruptions,\r\nbut so far as the volcano is a mountain it is a product of its own\r\naction. The grandest of volcanic eruptions have produced no mountains\r\nwhatever, but only vast plains or plateaus of consolidated molten rock,\r\nand every volcanic mountain at some time in its history has risen out\r\nof a relatively level surface.\r\n\r\nWhen the traditional notions about volcanoes grew up, it was supposed\r\nthat the solid earth was merely a “crust” enveloping still molten\r\nmaterial. As has already been pointed out in an earlier chapter, this\r\nview is no longer tenable, for we now know that the condition of matter\r\nwithin the earth’s interior, while perhaps not directly comparable to\r\nany that is known, yet has properties most resembling known matter in\r\na solid state; it is much more rigid than the best tool steel. While\r\nthere must be reservoirs of molten rock beneath active volcanoes, it\r\nis none the less clear that they are small, local, and temporary.\r\nThis is shown by the comparative study of volcanic outlets within any\r\ncircumscribed district.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps not easy to frame a definition of a volcano, but its\r\nessential part, instead of being a mountain, is rather a vent or\r\nchannel which opens up connection between a subsurface reservoir of\r\nmolten rock and the surface of the earth. An eruption occurs whenever\r\nthere is a rise of this material, together with more or less steam and\r\nadmixed gases, to the surface. Such molten rock arriving at the surface\r\nis designated _lava_. The changes in pressure upon this material during\r\nits elevation induce secondary phenomena as the surface is approached,\r\nand these manifestations are often most awe inspiring. While often\r\nlocally destructive, the geological importance of such phenomena is by\r\nreason of their terrifying aspect likely to be greatly exaggerated.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Early views concerning volcanic mountains.=—As already pointed out,\r\na volcano at its birth is not a mountain at all, but only, so to\r\nspeak, a shaft or channel of communication between the surface and a\r\nsubterranean reservoir of molten rock. By bringing this melted rock to\r\nthe surface there is built up a local elevation which may be designated\r\na mountain, except where the volume of the material is so large and is\r\nspread to such distances as to produce a plain (see fissure eruptions\r\nbelow).\r\n\r\nIn the early history of geology it was the view of the great German\r\ngeologist von Buch and his friend and colleague von Humboldt, that a\r\nvolcanic mountain was produced in much the same manner as is a blister\r\nupon the body. The fluids which push up the cuticle in the blister were\r\nhere replaced by fluid rock which elevated the sedimentary rock layers\r\nat the surface into a dome or mound which was open at the top—the\r\nso-called _crater_. This “elevation-crater” theory of volcanoes long\r\nheld the stage in geological science, although it ignored the very\r\npatent fact that the layers on the flanks of volcanic cones are not\r\nof sedimentary rock at all, but, on the contrary, of the volcanic\r\nmaterials which are brought up to the surface during the eruption.\r\nThe observational phase of science was, however, dawning, and the\r\nEnglish geologists Scrope and Lyell were able to show by study of\r\nvolcanic mountains that the mound about the volcanic vent was due to\r\nthe accumulation of once molten rock which had been either exuded or\r\nejected. Making use of data derived from New Zealand, Scrope showed\r\nthat, instead of being elevated during the formation of a volcanic\r\nmountain, the sedimentary strata of the vicinity may be depressed near\r\nthe volcanic vent (Fig. 87).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 87.—Breached volcanic cone near Auckland, New Zealand, showing\r\nthe bending down of the sedimentary strata in the neighborhood of the\r\nvent (after Heaphy and Scrope).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The birth of volcanoes.=—To confirm the impression that the formation\r\nof the volcanic mountain is in reality a secondary phenomenon\r\nconnected with eruptions, we may cite the observed birth of a number\r\nof volcanoes. On the 20th of September, 1538, a new volcano, since\r\nknown as Monte Nuovo (new mountain), rose on the border of the ancient\r\nLake Lucrinus to the westward of Naples. This small mountain attained\r\na height of 440 feet, and is still to be seen on the shore of the bay\r\nof Naples. From Mexico have been recorded the births of several new\r\nvolcanoes: Jorullo in 1759, Pochutla in 1870, and in 1881 a new volcano\r\nin the Ajusco Mountains about midway between the Gulf of Mexico and the\r\nPacific Ocean. The latest of new volcanoes is that raised in Japan on\r\nNovember 9, 1910, in connection with the eruption of Usu-san. This “New\r\nMountain” reached an elevation of 690 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 88.—View of the new Camiguin volcano from the sea. It was formed\r\nin 1871 over a nearly level plain. The town of Catarman appears at the\r\nright near the shore (after an unpublished photograph by Professor Dean\r\nC. Worcester).]\r\n\r\nAs described by von Humboldt, Jorullo rose in the night of the 28th\r\nof September, 1759, from a fissure which opened in a broad plain at\r\na point 35 miles distant from any then existing volcano. The most\r\nremarkable of new volcanoes rose in 1871 on the island of Camiguin\r\nnorthward from Mindanao in the Philippine archipelago. This mountain\r\nwas visited by the _Challenger_ expedition in 1875, and was first\r\nascended and studied thirty years later by a party under the leadership\r\nof Professor Dean C. Worcester, the Secretary of the Interior of the\r\nPhilippine Islands, to whom the writer is indebted for this description\r\nand the accompanying illustration of this largest and most interesting\r\nof new-born volcanoes. As in the case of Jorullo, the eruption began\r\nwith the formation of a fissure in a level plain, some 400 yards\r\ndistant from the town of Catarman (Fig. 88). The eruption continued\r\nfor four years, at the end of which time the height of the summit was\r\nestimated by the _Challenger_ expedition to be 1900 feet. At the time\r\nof the first ascent in 1905, the height was determined by aneroid as\r\n1750 feet, with sharp rock pinnacles projecting some 50 or 75 feet\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Active and extinct volcanoes.=—The terms “active” and “extinct”\r\nhave come into more or less common use to describe respectively those\r\nvolcanoes which show signs of eruptive activity, and those which are\r\nnot at the time active. The term “dormant” is applied to volcanoes\r\nrecently active and supposed to be in a doubtfully extinct condition.\r\nFrom a well-known volcano in the vicinity of Naples, volcanoes which no\r\nlonger erupt lava or cinder, but show gaseous emanations (_fumeroles_)\r\nare said to be in the _solfatara_ condition, or to show _solfataric_\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nExperience shows that the term “extinct”, while useful, must always be\r\ninterpreted to mean apparently extinct. This may be illustrated by the\r\nhistory of Mount Vesuvius, which before the Christian era was forested\r\nin the crater and showed no signs of activity; and in fact it is\r\nknown that for several centuries no eruption of the volcano had taken\r\nplace. Following a premonitory earthquake felt in the year 63, the\r\nmountain burst out in grand explosive eruption in 79 A.D. This eruption\r\nprofoundly altered the aspect of the mountain and buried the cities\r\nof Pompeii, Stabeii, and Herculaneum from sight. Once more, this time\r\nduring the middle ages, for nearly five centuries (1139 to 1631) there\r\nwas complete inactivity, if we except a light ash eruption in the year\r\n1500. During this period of rest the crater was again forested, but the\r\nrepose was suddenly terminated by one of the grandest eruptions in the\r\nmountain’s history.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.—Map showing the location of the belts of\r\nactive volcanoes.]\r\n\r\n=The earth’s volcano belts.=—The distribution of volcanoes is not\r\nuniform, but, on the contrary, volcanic vents appear in definite zones\r\nor belts, either upon the margins of the continents or included within\r\nthe oceanic areas (Fig. 89). The most important of these belts girdles\r\nthe Pacific Ocean, and is represented either by chains or by more\r\nwidely spaced volcanic mountains throughout the Cordilleran Mountain\r\nsystem of South and Central America and Mexico, by the volcanoes of the\r\nCoast and Cascade ranges of North America, the festooned volcanic chain\r\nof the Aleutian Islands, and the similar island arcs off the eastern\r\ncoast of the Eurasian continent. The belt is further continued through\r\nthe islands of Malaysia to New Zealand, and on the Pacific’s southern\r\nmargin are found the volcanoes of Victoria Land, King Edward Land, and\r\nWest Antarctica.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90.—A portion of the “fire girdle” of the Pacific,\r\nshowing the relation of the chains of volcanic mountains to the deeps\r\nof the neighboring ocean floor.]\r\n\r\nThis volcano girdle is by no means a perfect one, for in addition\r\nto the principal festoons of the western border there are many\r\nsecondary ones, and still other arcs are found well toward the center\r\nof the oceanic area. Another broad belt of volcanoes borders the\r\nMediterranean Sea, and is extended westward into the Atlantic Ocean.\r\nNarrower belts are found in both the northern and southern portions\r\nof the Atlantic Ocean, on the margins of the Caribbean Sea, etc. The\r\nfact of greatest significance in the distribution seems to be that\r\nbands of active volcanoes are to be found wherever mountain ranges are\r\nparalleled by deeps on the neighboring ocean floor (Fig. 90). As has\r\nbeen already pointed out in the chapter upon earthquakes, it is just\r\nsuch places as these which are the seat of earthquakes; these are zones\r\nof the earth’s crust which are undergoing the most rapid changes of\r\nlevel at the present time. Thus the rise of the land in mountains is\r\nproceeding simultaneously with the sinking of the sea floor to form the\r\nneighboring deeps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.—Volcanic cones formed in 1783 above the\r\nSkaptár fissure in Iceland (after Helland).]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 92.—Diagrams to illustrate the location of volcanic vents upon\r\nfissure lines, _a_, openings caused by lateral movement of fissure\r\nwalls; _b_, openings formed at fissure intersections.]\r\n\r\n=Arrangement of volcanic vents along fissures and especially at their\r\nintersections.=—Within those districts in which volcanoes are widely\r\nseparated from their neighbors, the law of their arrangement is\r\ndifficult to decipher, but the view that volcanic vents are aligned\r\nover fissures is now supported by so much evidence that illustrations\r\nmay be supplied from many regions. An exceptionally perfect line of\r\nsmall cones is found along the Skaptár cleft in Iceland, upon which\r\nstands the large volcano of Laki. This fissure reopened in 1783, and\r\ngreat volumes of lava were exuded. Over the cleft there was left a long\r\nline of volcanic cones (Fig. 91). There are in Iceland two dominating\r\nseries of parallel fissures of the same character which take their\r\ndirections respectively northeast-southwest and north-south. Many such\r\nfissures are traceable at the surface as deep and nearly straight\r\nclefts or _gjás_, usually a few yards in width, but extending for many\r\nmiles. The Eldgjá has a length of more than 18 English miles and a\r\ndepth varying from 400 to 600 feet. On some of these fissures no lava\r\nhas risen to the surface, whereas others have at numerous points exuded\r\nmolten rock. Sometimes one end only of a fissure, the more widely\r\ngaping portion, has supplied the conduits for the molten lava. This\r\nis well illustrated by the cratered monticules raised by the common\r\nant over the cracks which separate the blocks of cement sidewalk, the\r\nhillocks being located where the most favorable channel was found for\r\nthe elevation of the materials.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 93.—Outline map of the eastern portion of the island of Java,\r\ndisplaying the arrangement of volcanic vents in alignment upon fissures\r\nwith the larger mountains at fissure intersections (after Verbeek).]\r\n\r\nThose places upon fissures which become lava conduits appear to be the\r\nones where the cleft gapes widest so as to furnish the widest channel.\r\nWherever a differential lateral movement of the walls has occurred,\r\nopenings will be found in the neighborhood of each minor variation from\r\na straight line (Fig. 92_a_). Wherever there are two or more series\r\nof fissures, and this would appear to be the normal condition, places\r\nfavorable for lava conduits occur at fissure intersections. Within such\r\nveritable volcano gardens as are to be found in Malaysia, the law of\r\nvolcano distribution became apparent so soon as accurate maps had been\r\nprepared. Thus the outline map of a portion of the island of Java (Fig.\r\n93) shows us that while the volcanoes of the island present at first\r\nsight a more or less irregular band or zone, there are a number of\r\nfissures intersecting in a network, and that the volcanoes are aligned\r\nupon the fissures with the larger cones located at the intersections.\r\nSo also in Iceland, the great eruption of Askja in 1875 occurred at\r\nthe intersection of two lines of fissure.\r\n\r\nOutside these closely packed volcanic regions, similar though less\r\nmarked networks are indicated; as, for example, in and near the Gulf of\r\nGuinea. If now, instead of reducing the scale of our volcano maps, we\r\nincrease it, the same law of distribution is no less clearly brought\r\nout. The monticules or small volcanic cones which form upon the flanks\r\nof larger volcanic mountains are likewise built up over fissures which\r\non numerous occasions have been observed to open and the cones to form\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 94.—Map of the Puy Pariou in the Auvergne of central France. The\r\nseat of eruption has migrated along the fissure upon which the earlier\r\ncone had been built up (after Scrope).]\r\n\r\nStill further reducing now the area of our studies and considering for\r\nthe moment the “frozen” surface of the boiling lava within the caldron\r\nof Kilauea, this when observed at night reveals in great perfection\r\nthe sudden formation of fissures in the crust with the appearance\r\nof miniature volcanoes rising successively at more or less regular\r\nintervals along them.\r\n\r\nIt not infrequently happens that after a volcanic vent has become\r\nestablished above some conduit in a fissure, the conduit migrates along\r\nthe fissure, thus establishing a new cone with more or less complete\r\ndestruction of the old one (Fig. 94).\r\n\r\n\r\n=The so-called fissure eruptions.=—The grandest of all volcanic\r\neruptions have been those in which the entire length and breadth of\r\nthe fissures have been the passageway for the upwelling lava. Such\r\ngrander eruptions have been for the most part prehistoric, and in later\r\ngeologic history have occurred chiefly in India, in Abyssinia, in\r\nnorthwestern Europe, and in the northwestern United States. In western\r\nIndia the singularly horizontal plateaus of basaltic lava, the Dekkan\r\ntraps, cover some 200,000 square miles and are more than a mile in\r\ndepth. The underlying basement where it appears about the margins of\r\nthe basalt is in many places intersected by dikes or fissure fillings\r\nof the same material. No cones or definite vents have been found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 95.—Basaltic plateau of the northwestern United States due to\r\nfissure eruptions of lava.]\r\n\r\nThe larger portion of the northwestern British Isles would appear to\r\nhave been at one time similarly blanketed by nearly horizontal beds of\r\nbasaltic lava, which beds extended northwestward across the sea through\r\nthe Orkney and Faroe islands to Iceland. Remnants of this vast plateau\r\nare to-day found in all the island groups as well as in large areas of\r\nnortheastern Ireland, and fissure fillings of the same material occur\r\nthroughout large areas of the British Isles. In many cases these dikes\r\nrepresent once molten rock which may never have communicated with the\r\nsurface at the time of the lava outpouring, yet they well illustrate\r\nwhat we might expect to find if the basalt sheets of Iceland or Ireland\r\nwere to be removed.\r\n\r\nThe floods of basaltic lava which in the northwestern United States\r\nhave yielded the barren plateau of the Cascade Mountains (Fig. 95)\r\nwould appear to offer another example of fissure eruption, though cones\r\nappear upon the surface and perhaps indicate the position of lava\r\noutlets during the later phases of the eruptive period. The barrenness\r\nand desolation of these lava plains is suggested by Fig. 96.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96.—Lava plains about the Snake River in Idaho.]\r\n\r\nThough the greater effusions of lava have occurred in prehistoric\r\ntimes, and the manner of extrusion has necessarily been largely\r\ninferred from the immense volume of the exuded materials and the\r\nexistence of basaltic dikes in neighboring regions, yet in Iceland\r\nwe are able to observe the connection between the dikes and the lava\r\noutflows. Professor Thoroddsen has stated that in the great basaltic\r\nplateau of Iceland, lava has welled out quietly from the whole length\r\nof fissures and often on both sides without giving rise to the\r\nformation of cones. At three wider portions of the great Eld cleft,\r\nlava welled out quietly without the formation of cones, though here in\r\nthe southern prolongation of the fissure, where it was narrower, a row\r\nof low slag cones appeared. Where the lava outwellings occurred, an\r\narea of 270 square miles was flooded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97.—Characteristic profiles of lava volcanoes. 1,\r\nbasaltic lava mountain; 2, mountain of siliceous lava (after Judd).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The composition and the properties of lava.=—In our study of igneous\r\nrocks (Chapter IV) it was learned that they are composed for the most\r\npart of silicate minerals, and that in their chemical composition they\r\nrepresent various proportions of silica, alumina, iron, magnesia,\r\nlime, potash, and soda. The more abundant of these constituents is\r\nsilica, which varies from 35 to 70 per cent of the whole. Whenever the\r\ncontent of silica is relatively low,—basic or basaltic lava,—the\r\ncooled rock is dark in color and relatively heavy. It melts at a\r\nrelatively low temperature, and is in consequence relatively fluid\r\nat the temperatures which lavas usually have on reaching the earth’s\r\nsurface. Furthermore, from being more fluid, the water which is nearly\r\nalways present in large quantity within the lava more readily makes its\r\nescape upon reaching the surface. Eruptions of such lava are for this\r\nreason without the violent aspects which belong to extrusions of more\r\nsiliceous (more “acidic”) lavas. For the same reason, also, basaltic\r\nlava flows more freely and can spread much farther before it has\r\ncooled sufficiently to consolidate. This is equivalent to saying that\r\nits surface will assume a flatter angle of slope, which in the case\r\nof basaltic lava seldom exceeds ten degrees and may be less than one\r\ndegree (Fig. 97).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98.—A driblet cone (after J. D. Dana).]\r\n\r\nSiliceous lavas, on the other hand, are, when consolidated,\r\nrelatively light both in color and weight and melt at relatively high\r\ntemperatures. They are, therefore, usually but partly fused and of a\r\nviscous consistency when they arrive at the earth’s surface. Because\r\nof this viscosity they offer much resistance to the liberation of the\r\ncontained water, which therefore is released only to the accompaniment\r\nof more or less violent explosions. The lava is blown into the air\r\nand usually falls as consolidated fragments of various degrees of\r\ncoarseness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 99.—View of Leffingwell crater, a cinder cone in the Owens\r\nvalley, California (after an unpublished photograph by W. D. Johnson).]\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be assumed that the temperature of lava is always\r\nthe same when it arrives at the surface, and hence it may happen that\r\na siliceous lava is exuded at so high a temperature that it behaves\r\nlike a normal basaltic lava. On the other hand, basaltic lavas may be\r\nextruded at unusually low temperatures, in which case their behavior\r\nmay resemble that of the normal siliceous lavas. If, however, as is\r\ngenerally the case, the energy of explosion of a basaltic lava is\r\nrelatively small, any ejected portions of the liquid lava travel to\r\na moderate height only in the air, so that on falling they are still\r\nsufficiently pasty to adhere to rock surfaces and thus build up the\r\nremarkably steep cones and spines known as “spatter cones” or “driblet\r\ncones” (Fig. 98). When, on the other hand, the energy of explosion is\r\ngreat, as is normally the case with siliceous lavas, the portions of\r\nejected lava have been fully consolidated before their fall to the\r\nsurface, so that they build up the same type of accumulation as would\r\nsand falling in the same manner. The structures which they form are\r\nknown as tuff, cinder, or ash cones (Fig. 99).\r\n\r\nWhenever the contained water passes off from siliceous lavas without\r\nviolent explosions, the lava may flow from the vent, but in contrast to\r\nbasaltic lavas it travels a short distance only before consolidating.\r\nThe resulting mountain is in consequence proportionately high and steep\r\n(Fig. 97). Eruptions characterized by violent explosions accompanied by\r\na fall of cinder are described as _explosive_ eruptions. Those which\r\nare relatively quiet, and in which the chief product is in the form of\r\nstreams of flowing lava, are spoken of as _convulsive_ eruptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The three main types of volcanic mountain.=—If the eruptions at a\r\nvolcanic vent are exclusively of the explosive type, the material\r\nof the mountain which results is throughout tuff or cinder, and the\r\nvolcano is described as a _cinder cone_. If, on the other hand, the\r\nvent at every eruption exudes lava, a mountain of solid rock results\r\nwhich is a _lava dome_. It is, however, the exception for a volcano\r\nwhich has a long history to manifest but a single kind of eruption. At\r\none time exuding lava comparatively quietly, at another the violence\r\nwith which the steam is liberated yields only cinder, and the mountain\r\nis a composite of the two materials and is known as a _composite\r\nvolcanic cone_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The lava dome.=—When successive lava flows come from a crater, the\r\nstructure which results has the form of a more or less perfect dome. If\r\nthe lava be of the basaltic or fluid type, the slopes are flat, seldom\r\nmaking an angle of as much as ten degrees with the horizon and flatter\r\ntoward the summit (Fig. 101, p. 106). If of siliceous or viscous lava,\r\non the other hand, the slopes are correspondingly steep and in some\r\ncases precipitous. To this latter class belong some of the _Kuppen_ of\r\nGermany, the _puys_ of central France, and the _mamelons_ of the Island\r\nof Bourbon.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 100.—Map of Hawaii and the lava volcanoes of Mokuaweoweo (Mauna\r\nLoa) and Kilauea (after the government map by Alexander).]\r\n\r\n=The basaltic lava domes of Hawaii.=—At the “crossroads of the\r\nPacific” rises a double line of lava volcanoes which reach from 20,000\r\nto 30,000 feet above the floor of the ocean, some of them among\r\nthe grandest volcanic mountains that are known. More than half the\r\nheight and a much larger proportion of the bulk of the largest of\r\nthese are hidden beneath the ocean’s surface. The two great active\r\nvents are Mokuaweoweo (on Mauna Loa) and Kilauea, distinct volcanoes\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that their lava extravasations have been\r\nmerged in a single mass. The rim of the crater of Mauna Loa is at an\r\nelevation of 13,675 feet above the sea, whereas that of Kilauea is\r\nless than 4000 feet and appears to rest upon the flank of the larger\r\nmountain (Figs. 100 and 101). Although one crater is but 20 miles\r\ndistant from the other and nearly 10,000 feet lower, their eruptions\r\nhave apparently been unsympathetic. Nowhere have still active lava\r\nmountains been subjected to such frequent observations extending\r\nthroughout a long period, and the dynamics of their eruptions are\r\nfairly well understood. To put this before the reader, it will be\r\nbest to consider both mountains, for though they have much in common,\r\nthe observations from one are strangely complementary to those of the\r\nother. The lower crater being easily accessible, Kilauea has been often\r\nvisited, and there exists a long series of more or less consecutive\r\nobservations upon it, which have been assembled and studied by Dana and\r\nHitchcock. The place of outflow of the Kilauea lavas has not generally\r\nbeen visible, whereas Mokuaweoweo has slopes rising nearly 14,000 feet\r\nabove the sea and displays the records of outflow of many eruptions,\r\nsome of which were accompanied by the grandest of volcanic phenomena.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101.—Section through Mauna Loa and Kilauea.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lava movements within the caldron of Kilauea.=—The craters of these\r\nmountains are the largest of active ones, each being in excess of\r\nseven miles in circumference. In shape they are irregularly elliptical\r\nand consist of a series of steps or terraces descending to a pit at the\r\nbottom, in which are open lakes of boiling lava. Enough is known of the\r\nhistory of Kilauea to state that the steep cliffs bounding the terraces\r\nare fault walls produced by inbreak of a frozen lava surface. The cliff\r\nbelow the so-called “black ledge” was produced by the falling in of\r\nthe frozen lava surface at the time of the outflow of 1840, the lava\r\nissuing upon the eastern flank of the mountain and pouring into the sea\r\nnear Nanawale. Since that date the floor of the pit below the level of\r\nthis ledge has been essentially a movable platform of frozen lava of\r\nunknown and doubtless variable thickness which has risen and descended\r\nlike the floor of an elevator car between its guiding ways (Fig. 102).\r\nThe floor has, however, never been complete, for one or more open lakes\r\nare always to be seen, that of Halemaumau located near the southwestern\r\nmargin having been much the most persistent. Within the open lakes the\r\nboiling lava is apparently white hot at the depth of but a few inches\r\nbelow the surface, and in the overturnings of the mass these hotter\r\nportions are brought to the surface and appear as white streaks marking\r\nthe redder surface portions. From time to time the surface freezes\r\nover, then cracks open and erupt at favored points along the fissures,\r\nsending up jets and fountains of lava, the material of which falls in\r\npasty fragments that build up driblet cones. Small fluid clots are\r\nshot out, carrying a threadlike line of lava glass behind them, the\r\nwell-known “Pelé’s hair.” Sometimes the open lakes build up congealed\r\nwalls, rising above the general level of the pit, and from their rim\r\nthe lava spills over in cascades to spread out upon the frozen floor,\r\nthus increasing its thickness from above (Fig. 103). At other times\r\na great dome of lava has been pushed up from the pit of Halemaumau\r\nunder a frozen shell, the molten lava shining red through cracks in\r\nits surface and exuding so as to heal each widely opened fissure as it\r\nforms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 102.—Schematic diagram to illustrate the moving platform of\r\nfrozen lava which rises and falls in the crater of Kilauea.]\r\n\r\nAt intervals of from a few years to nine or ten years the crater has\r\nbeen periodically drained, at which times the moving platform of\r\nfrozen lava has sunk more or less rapidly to levels far below the black\r\nledge and from 900 to 1700 feet below the crater rim. Following this\r\ndescent a slow progressive rise is inaugurated, which has sometimes\r\ngone on at a rate of more than a hundred feet per year, though it is\r\nusually much slower than this. When the platform has reached a height\r\nvarying from 700 to 350 feet below the crater rim, another sudden\r\nsettlement occurs which again carries the pit floor downward a distance\r\nof from 300 to 700 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 103.—View of the open lava lake of Halemaumau within the crater\r\nof Kilauea, the molten lava shown cascading over the raised lava walls\r\non to the floor of the pit (after Pavlow).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The draining of the lava caldrons.=—The changes which go on within\r\nthe crater of Mokuaweoweo, though less studied than those of Kilauea,\r\nappear to be in some respects different. Here every eruption seems\r\nto be preceded by a more or less rapid influx of melted lava to the\r\npit of the crater, this phenomenon being observed from a distance as\r\na brilliant light above the crater—the reflection of the glow from\r\noverhanging vapor clouds. The uprising of the lava has often been\r\naccompanied by the formation of high lava fountains upon the surface,\r\nand the molten lava sometimes appears in fissures near the crater rim\r\nat levels well above the lava surface within the pit.\r\n\r\nAlthough in many cases the lava which has thus flooded the crater has\r\nsuddenly drained away without again becoming visible, it is probable\r\nthat in such cases an outlet has been found to some submarine exit,\r\nsince under-ocean discharge effects have been observed in connection\r\nwith eruptions of each of the volcanoes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 104.—Map showing the manner of outflow of lava from Kilauea\r\nduring the eruption of 1840. The outflowing lava made its appearance\r\nsuccessively at the points _A_, _B_, _C_, _m_, _n_, and finally at a\r\npoint below _n_, from whence it issued in volume and flowed down to the\r\nsea at Nanawale (after J. D. Dana).]\r\n\r\nInasmuch as no earthquakes are felt in connection with such outflows\r\nas have been described, it is probable that the hot lava fuses a\r\npassageway for itself into some open channel underneath the flanks\r\nof the mountain. Such a course is well illustrated by the outflow\r\nof Kilauea in 1840, when, it will be remembered, occurred the great\r\ndown-plunge of the crater that yielded the pit below the black ledge.\r\nAt this time the lava first made its appearance upon the flanks of the\r\nmountain at the bottom of a small pit or inbreak crater which opened\r\nfive miles southeast of the main crater of Kilauea (Fig. 104). Within\r\nthis new crater the lava rose, and small ejections soon followed from\r\nfissures formed in its neighborhood. Some time after, the lava sank\r\nin the first new crater, only to reappear successively at other small\r\nopenings (Fig. 104, _B_, _C_, _m_, _n_) and finally to issue in volume\r\nat a point eleven miles from the shore and flow thereafter _upon\r\nthe surface_ of the mountain until it had reached the sea. Only the\r\nslightest earth tremors were felt, and as no rumblings were heard, it\r\nis evident that the lava fused its way along a buried channel largely\r\nopen at the time (see below, p. 112).\r\n\r\nIn a majority of the eruptions of Mokuaweoweo, when the outflowing\r\nlavas have become visible, the molten rock has apparently fused its way\r\nout to the surface of the mountain at points from 1000 to 3000 feet\r\nbelow the bottom of the crater, and this discharge has corresponded\r\nin time to the lowering of the lava surface within the crater. There\r\nare, however, three instances upon record in which the lava issued\r\nfrom definite rents which were formed upon the mountain flanks at\r\ncomparatively low levels. In contrast to the formation of fused\r\noutlets, these ruptures of a portion of the mountain’s flank were\r\nalways accompanied by vigorous local earthquakes of short duration. In\r\none instance (the eruption of 1851) such a rent appeared under the same\r\nconditions but at an elevation of 12,500 feet, or near the level of the\r\nlava in the crater.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The outflow of the lava floods.=—In order to properly comprehend\r\nthese and many otherwise puzzling phenomena connected with\r\nvolcanoes, it is necessary to keep ever in mind the quite remarkable\r\nheat-insulating property of congealed lava. So soon as a thin crust\r\nhas formed upon the surface of molten rock, the heat of the underlying\r\nfluid mass is given off with extreme slowness, so that lava streams no\r\nlonger connected with their internal lava reservoirs may remain molten\r\nfor decades.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 105.—Lava of Matavanu upon the Island of Savaii flowing down to\r\nthe sea during the eruption of 1906. The course may be followed by the\r\njets of steam escaping from the surface down to the great steam cloud\r\nwhich rises where the fluid lava discharges into the sea (after H. I.\r\nJensen).]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that for Mokuaweoweo and Kilauea, lava either quietly\r\nmelts its way to the surface at the time of outflow, or else produces a\r\nrent for its egress to the accompaniment of vigorous local earthquakes.\r\nIn either case if the lava issues at a point far below the crater,\r\ngigantic lava fountains arise at the point of outflow, the fluid rock\r\nshooting up to heights which range from 250 to 600 or more feet above\r\nthe surface. A certain proportion of this fluid lava is sufficiently\r\ncooled to consolidate while traveling in the air, and falling, it\r\nbuilds up a cinder cone which is left as a location monument for\r\nthe place of discharge. From this outlet the molten lava begins its\r\njourney down the slope of the mountain, and quickly freezes over to\r\nproduce a tunnel, beneath the roof of which the fluid lava flows with\r\ncomparatively slow further loss of heat. Save for occasional steam jets\r\nissuing from its surface, it may give little indication of its presence\r\nuntil it has reached the sea (Fig. 105).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106.—Lava stream discharging into the sea from\r\nbeneath the frozen roof of a lava tunnel. Eruption of Matavanu on\r\nSavaii in 1906 (after Sapper).]\r\n\r\nIf sufficient in volume and the shore be not too distant, the stream\r\nof lava arrives at the sea, where, discharging from the mouth of its\r\ntunnel, it throws up vast volumes of steam and induces ebullition of\r\nthe water over a wide area (Fig. 106). Professor Dana, who visited\r\nHawaii a few months only after the great outflow of 1840, states that\r\nthe lava, upon reaching the ocean, was shivered like melted glass and\r\nthrown up in millions of particles which darkened the sky and fell like\r\nhail over the surrounding country. The light was so bright that at a\r\ndistance of forty miles fine print could be read at midnight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 107.—Diagrammatic representation of the structure of the flanks\r\nof lava volcanoes as a result of the draining of frozen lava streams.]\r\n\r\nProtected from any extensive consolidation by its congealed cover, the\r\nlava within a stream may all drain away, leaving behind an empty lava\r\ntunnel, which in the case of the Hawaiian volcanoes sometimes has its\r\nroof hung with beautiful lava stalactites and its floor studded with\r\nthin lava spines. Later lava outflows over the same or neighboring\r\ncourses bury such tunnels beneath others of similar nature, giving\r\nto the mountain flanks an elongated cellular structure illustrated\r\nschematically in Fig. 107. These buried channels may in the future be\r\nagain utilized for outflows similar in character to that of Kilauea in\r\n1840.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 108.—Diagram to show the manner of formation of mesas or table\r\nmountains by the outflow of lava in valleys and the subsequent more\r\nrapid erosion of the intervening ridges. _R_, earlier river valley;\r\n_R’R’_, later valleys.]\r\n\r\nWhile the formation of lava stalactites of such perfection and beauty\r\nis peculiar to the Hawaiian lava tunnels, the formation of the tunnel\r\nin connection with lava outflow is the rule wherever a dissipation at\r\nthe end has permitted of drainage. A few hours only after the flow has\r\nbegun, the frozen surface has usually a thickness of a few inches, and\r\nthis cover may be walked over with the lava still molten below. At\r\nfirst in part supported by the molten lava, the tunnel roof sometimes\r\ncaves in so soon as drainage has occurred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.—Surface of lava of the Pahoehoe type.]\r\n\r\nWherever basaltic lava has spread out in valleys on the surface of\r\nmore easily eroded material, either cinder or sedimentary formations,\r\nthe softer intervening ridges are first carried away by the eroding\r\nagencies, leaving the lava as cappings upon residual elevations.\r\nThus are derived a type of table mountain or _mesa_ of the sort well\r\nillustrated upon the western slopes of the Sierra Nevadas in California\r\n(Fig. 108).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 110.—Three successive views to illustrate the growth of the\r\nIsland of Savaii from the outflow of lava at Matavanu in the year 1906.\r\n_a_, near the beginning of the outflow; _b_, some weeks later than _a_;\r\n_c_, some weeks later than _b_ (after H. I. Jensen).]\r\n\r\nThe surface which flowing lava assumes, while subject to considerable\r\nvariation, may yet be classified into two rather distinct types. On\r\nthe one hand there is the billowy surface in which ellipsoidal or\r\nkidney-shaped masses, each with dimensions of from one to several feet,\r\nlie merged in one another, not unlike an irregular collection of sofa\r\npillows. This type of lava has become known as the _Pahoehoe_, from\r\nthe Hawaiian occurrence (Fig. 109). A variation from this type is the\r\n“corded” or “ropy” lava, the surface of which much resembles rope as it\r\nis coiled along the deck of a vessel, the coils being here the lines of\r\nscum or scoriæ arranged in this manner by the currents at the surface\r\nof the stream (Fig. 123, p. 124). A quite different type is the block\r\nlava (_Aa_ type) which usually has a ragged scoriaceous surface and\r\nconsists of more or less separate fragments of cooled lava (Fig. 131,\r\np. 130).\r\n\r\nWherever lava flows into the sea in quantity, it extends the margin of\r\nthe shore, often by considerable areas. The outflow of Kilauea in 1840\r\nextended the shore of Hawaii outward for the distance of a quarter of a\r\nmile, and a more recent illustration of such extension of land masses\r\nis furnished by Fig. 110.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE RISE OF MOLTEN ROCK TO THE EARTH’S SURFACE\r\n\r\nVOLCANIC MOUNTAINS OF EJECTED MATERIALS\r\n\r\n\r\n=The mechanics of crater explosions.=—If we now turn from the lava\r\nvolcano to the active cinder cone, we encounter an entire change of\r\nscene. In place of the quiet flow and convulsive movements of the\r\nmolten lava, we here meet with repeated explosions of greater or less\r\nviolence. If we are to profitably study the manner of the explosions,\r\nconsidering the volcanic vent as a great experimental apparatus, it\r\nwould be well to select for our purpose a volcano which is in a not too\r\nviolent mood. The well-known cinder cone of Stromboli in the Eolian\r\ngroup of islands north of Sicily has, with short and unimportant\r\ninterruptions, remained in a state of light explosive activity since\r\nthe beginning of the Christian era. Rising as it does some three\r\nthousand feet directly out of the Mediterranean, and displaying by day\r\na white steam cap and an intermittent glow by night, its summit can be\r\nseen for a distance of a hundred miles at sea and it has justly been\r\ncalled the “Lighthouse of the Mediterranean.” The “flash” interval\r\nof this beacon may vary from one to twenty minutes, and it may show,\r\nfurthermore, considerable variation of intensity.\r\n\r\nFor the reason that the crater of the mountain is located at one side\r\nand at a considerable distance below the actual summit, the opportunity\r\nhere afforded of looking into the crater is most favorable whenever\r\nthe direction of the wind is such as to push aside the overhanging\r\nsteam cloud (Fig. 111). Long ago the Italian vulcanologist Spallanzani\r\nundertook to make observations from above the crater, and many others\r\nsince his day have profited by his example.\r\n\r\nWithin the crater of the volcano there is seen a lava surface lightly\r\nfrozen over and traversed by many cracks from which vapor jets\r\nare issuing. Here, as in the Kilauea crater, there are open pools\r\nof boiling lava. From some of these, lava is seen welling out to\r\noverflow the frozen surface; from others, steam is ejected in puffs\r\nas though from the stack of a locomotive. Within others lava is seen\r\nheaving up and down in violent ebullition, and at intervals a great\r\nbubble of steam is ejected with explosive violence, carrying up with\r\nit a considerable quantity of the still molten lava, together with\r\nits scumlike surface, to fall outside the crater and rattle down\r\nthe mountain’s slope into the sea. Following this explosion the\r\nlava surface in the pool is lowered and the agitation is renewed,\r\nto culminate after the further lapse of a few minutes in a second\r\nexplosion of the same nature. The rise of the lava which precedes the\r\nejection appears at night as a brighter reflection or glow from the\r\noverhanging steam cloud—the flash seen by the mariner from his vessel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 111.—The volcano of Stromboli, showing the excentric position of\r\nthe crater (after a sketch by Judd).]\r\n\r\nWhat is going on within the crater of Stromboli we may perhaps best\r\nillustrate by the boiling of a stiff porridge over a hot fire. Any one\r\nwho has made corn mush over a hot camp fire is fully aware that in\r\nproportion as the mush becomes thicker by the addition of the meal, it\r\nis necessary to stir the mass with redoubled vigor if anything is to be\r\nretained within the kettle. The thickening of the mush increases its\r\nviscosity to such an extent that the steam which is generated within it\r\nis unable to make its escape unless aided by openings continually made\r\nfor it by the stirring spoon. If the stirring motion be stopped for a\r\nmoment, the steam expands to form great bubbles which soon eject the\r\npasty mass from the kettle.\r\n\r\nFor the crater of Stromboli this process is illustrated by the series\r\nof diagrams in Fig. 112. As the lava rises toward the surface,\r\npresumably as a result of convectional currents within the chimney of\r\nthe volcano, the contained steam is relieved from pressure, so that\r\nat some depth below the surface it begins to separate out in minute\r\nvesicles or bubbles, which, expanding as they rise, acquire a rapidly\r\naccelerating velocity. Soon they flow together with a quite sudden\r\nincrease of their expansive energy, and now shooting upward with\r\nfurther accelerated velocity, a layer of liquid lava with its cover of\r\nscum is raised on the surface of a gigantic bubble and thrown high into\r\nthe air. Cooled during their flight, the quickly congealed lava masses\r\nbecome the tuff or volcanic ash which is the material of the cinder\r\ncone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112.—Diagrams to illustrate the nature of\r\neruptions within the crater of Stromboli.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Grander volcanic eruptions of cinder cones.=—Most cinder and\r\ncomposite cones, in the intervals between their grander eruptions, if\r\nnot entirely quiescent, lapse into a period, of light activity during\r\nwhich their crater eruptions appear to be in all essential respects\r\nlike the habitual explosions within the Strombolian crater. This phase\r\nof activity is, therefore, described as _Strombolian_. By contrast,\r\nthe occasional grander eruptions which have punctuated the history\r\nof all larger volcanoes are described in the language of Mercalli as\r\n_Vulcanian_ eruptions, from the best studied example.\r\n\r\nJust what it is that at intervals brings on the grander Vulcanian\r\noutburst within a volcano is not known with certainty; but it is\r\nimportant to note that there is an approach to periodicity in the\r\ngrander eruptions. It is generally possible to distinguish eruptions of\r\nat least two orders of intensity greater than the Strombolian phase;\r\na grander one, the examples of which may be separated by centuries,\r\nand one or more orders of relatively moderate intensity which recur\r\nat intervals perhaps of decades, their time intervals subdividing the\r\nlarger periods marked off by the eruptions of the first order.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 113.—Map of Volcano in the Eolian group of islands. The smaller\r\ncraters partially dissected by the waves belong to Vulcanello (after\r\nJudd).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The eruption of Volcano in 1888.=—In the Eolian Islands to the north\r\nof Sicily was located the mythical forge of Vulcan. From this locality\r\nhas come our word “volcano”, and both the island and the mountain bear\r\nno other name to-day (Fig. 113). There is in the structure of the\r\nisland the record of a somewhat complex volcanic history, but the form\r\nof the large central cinder cone was, according to Scrope, acquired\r\nduring the eruption of 1786, at which time the crater is reported to\r\nhave vomited ash for a period of fifteen days. Passing after this\r\neruption into the solfatara condition, with the exception of a light\r\neruption in 1873, the volcano remained quiet until 1886. So active\r\nhad been the fumeroles within the crater during the latter part of\r\nthis period that an extensive plant had been established there for\r\nthe collection especially of boracic acid. In 1886 occurred a slight\r\neruption, sufficient to clear out the bottom of the crater, though\r\nnot seriously to disturb the English planter whose vineyards and fig\r\norchards were in the valley or _atrio_ near the point _d_ upon the map\r\n(Fig. 113), nearly a mile from the crater rim. On the 3d of August,\r\n1888, came the opening discharge of an eruption, which, while not of\r\nthe first order of magnitude, was yet the greatest in more than a\r\ncentury of the mountain’s history, and may serve us to illustrate the\r\nVulcanian phase of activity within a cinder cone. During the day, to\r\nthe accompaniment of explosions of considerable violence, projectiles\r\nfell outside the crater rim and rolled down the steep slopes toward the\r\n_atrio_. These explosions were repeated at intervals of from twenty to\r\nthirty minutes, each beginning in a great upward rush of steam and\r\nash, accompanied by a low rumbling sound. During the following night\r\nthe eruptions increased in violence, and the anxious planter remained\r\non watch in his villa a mile from the crater. Falling asleep toward\r\nmorning, he was rudely awakened by a rain of projectiles falling upon\r\nhis roof. Hastily snatching up his two children he ran toward the door\r\njust as a red hot projectile, some two feet in diameter, descended\r\nthrough the roof, ceiling, and floor of the drawing room, setting fire\r\nto the building. A second projectile similar to the first was smashed\r\ninto fragments at his feet as he was emerging from the house, burning\r\none of the children. Making his escape to Vulcanello at the extremity\r\nof the island, the remainder of the night and the following day, until\r\nrescue came from Lipari, were spent just beyond the range of the\r\nfalling masses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 114.—“Bread-crust” lava projectile from the eruption of Volcano\r\nin 1888 (after Mercalli).]\r\n\r\nWhen the writer visited the island some months later, the eruption was\r\nstill so vigorous that the crater could not be reached. The ruined\r\nvilla, smashed and charred, stood with its walls half buried in ash and\r\nlapilli, among which were partly smashed pumiceous lava projectiles.\r\nThe entire _atrio_ about the mountain lay buried in cinder to the depth\r\nof several feet and was strewn with projectiles which varied in size\r\nfrom a man’s fist to several feet in diameter (Fig. 114). The larger of\r\nthese exhibited the peculiar “bread-crust” surface and had generally\r\nbeen smashed by the force of their fall after the manner of a pumpkin\r\nwhich has been thrown hard against the ground. One of these projectiles\r\nfully three feet in diameter was found at the distance of a mile and\r\na half from the crater. Though diminished considerably in intensity,\r\nthe rhythmic explosions within the crater still recurred at intervals\r\nvarying from four minutes to half an hour, and were accompanied\r\nby a dull roar easily heard at Lipari on a neighboring island six\r\nmiles away. Simultaneously, a dark cloud of “smoke”, the peculiar\r\n“cauliflower cloud” or _pino_ mounted for a couple of miles above the\r\ncrater (Fig. 115), and the rise was succeeded by a rain of small lava\r\nfragments or _lapilli_ outside the crater rim.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 115.—Peculiar “cauliflower cloud” or _pino_ composed of steam and\r\nash, rising above the cinder cone of Volcano during the waning phases\r\nof the explosive eruption of 1888 (after a photograph by B. Hobson).]\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no good reason to doubt that Vulcanian cinder\r\neruptions of this type differ chiefly in magnitude from the rhythmic\r\nexplosion within the crater of Stromboli, if we except the elevation of\r\na considerable quantity of accessory and older tuff which is derived\r\nfrom the inner walls of the crater and carried upward into the air\r\ntogether with the pasty cakes of fresh lava derived from the chimney.\r\nIt is this accessory material which gives to the _pino_ its dark or\r\neven black appearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 116.—Double explosive eruption of Taal volcano on the morning of\r\nJanuary 30, 1911.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The eruption of Taal volcano on January 30, 1911.=—The recent\r\neruption of the cinder cone known as Taal volcano is of interest,\r\nnot only because so fresh in mind, but because two neighboring vents\r\nerupted simultaneously with explosions of nearly equal violence (Fig.\r\n116). This Philippine volcano lies near the center of a lake some\r\nfifteen miles in diameter and about fifty miles south of the city of\r\nManila. After a period of rest extending over one hundred and fifty\r\nyears, the symptoms of the coming eruption developed rapidly, and on\r\nthe morning of January 30 grand explosions of steam and ash occurred\r\nsimultaneously in the neighboring craters, and the condensed moisture\r\nbrought down the ash in an avalanche of scalding mud which buried the\r\nentire island. Almost the entire population of the island, numbering\r\nseveral hundreds, was literally buried in the blistering mud (Fig.\r\n117); and the gases from the explosions carried to the distant shores\r\nof the lake added to this number many hundred victims.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 117.—The thick mud veneer upon the island of Taal (after a\r\nphotograph by Deniston).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118.—A pear-shaped lava projectile.]\r\n\r\nThe shocks which accompanied the explosions raised a great wave upon\r\nthe surface of the lake, which, advancing upon the shores, washed away\r\nstructures for a distance of nearly a half mile.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The materials and the structure of cinder cones.=—Obviously the\r\nmaterials which compose cinder cones are the cooled lava fragments of\r\nvarious degrees of coarseness which have been ejected from the crater.\r\nIf larger than a finger joint, such fragments are referred to as\r\n_volcanic projectiles_, or, incorrectly, as “volcanic bombs.” Of the\r\nlarger masses it is often true that the force of expulsion has not been\r\napplied opposite the center of mass of the body. Thus it follows that\r\nthey undergo complex whirling motions during their flight, and being\r\nstill semiliquid, they develop curious pear-shaped or less regular\r\nforms (Fig. 118). When crystals have already separated out in the lava\r\nbefore its rise in the chimney of the volcano, the surrounding fluid\r\nlava may be blown to finely divided volcanic dust which floats away\r\nupon the wind, thus leaving the crystals intact to descend as a crystal\r\nrain about the crater. Such a shower occurred in connection with the\r\neruption of Etna in 1669, and the black augite crystals may to-day be\r\ngathered by the handful from the slopes of the Monti Rossi (Fig. 125,\r\np. 125).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 119.—Artificial production of the structure of a cinder cone with\r\nuse of colored sands carried up in alternation by a current of air\r\n(after G. Linck).]\r\n\r\nThe term _lapilli_, or sometimes _rapilli_, is applied to the ejected\r\nlava fragments when of the average size of a finger joint. This is the\r\nmaterial which still partially covers the unexhumed portions of the\r\ncity of Pompeii. Volcanic _sand_, _ash_, and _dust_ are terms applied\r\nin order to increasingly fine particles of the ejected lava. The\r\nfinest material, the volcanic dust, is often carried for hundreds and\r\nsometimes even for thousands of miles from the crater in the high-level\r\ncurrents of the atmosphere. Inasmuch as this material is deposited far\r\nfrom the crater and in layers more or less horizontal, such material\r\nplays a small rôle in the formation of the cinder cone. The coarser\r\nsands and ash, on the other hand, are the materials from which the\r\ncinder cone is largely constructed.\r\n\r\nThe manner of formation and the structure of cinder cones may be\r\nillustrated by use of a simple laboratory apparatus (Fig. 119). Through\r\nan opening in a board, first white and then colored sand is sent up in\r\na light current of air or gas supplied from suitable apparatus. The\r\nalternating layers of the sand form in the attitudes shown; that is\r\nto say, dipping inward or toward the chimney of the volcano at all\r\npoints within the crater rim, and outward or away from it at all points\r\noutside (Fig. 119). If the experiment is carried so far that at its\r\ntermination sand slides down the crater walls into the chimney below,\r\nthe inward dipping layers will be truncated, or even removed entirely,\r\nas shown in Fig. 119 _b_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 120.—Diagram to show the contrast between a lava dome and a\r\ncinder cone. _AAA_, cinder cone; _BabC_, lava dome; _DE_, line of low\r\ncinder cones above a fissure (after Thoroddsen).]\r\n\r\n=The profile lines of cinder cones.=—The shapes of cinder cones are\r\nnotably different from those of lava mountains. While the latter are\r\ndomes, the mountains constructed of cinder are conical and have curves\r\nof profile that are concave upward instead of convex (Fig. 120). In\r\nthe earlier stages of its growth the cinder cone has a crater which in\r\nproportion to the height of the mountain is relatively broad (Fig. 99,\r\np. 104).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 121.—Mayon volcano on the island of Luzon, P.I. A remarkably\r\nperfect high cinder cone.]\r\n\r\nSpeaking broadly, the diameter of the crater is a measure of the\r\nviolence of the explosions within the chimney. A single series of short\r\nand violent explosive eruptions builds a low and broad cinder cone.\r\nA long-continued succession of moderately violent explosions, on the\r\nother hand, builds a high cone with crater diameter small if compared\r\nwith the mountain’s altitude, and the profile afforded is a remarkably\r\nbeautiful sweeping curve (Fig. 121). Toward the summit of such a cone\r\nthe loose materials of which it is composed are at as steep an angle as\r\nthey can lie, the so-called angle of repose of the material; whereas\r\nlower down the flatter slopes have been determined by the distribution\r\nof the cinder during its fall from the air. When one makes the ascent\r\nof such a mountain, he encounters continually steeper grades, with the\r\nmost difficult slope just below the crest.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 122.—A series of breached cinder cones where the place of\r\neruption has migrated along the underlying fissure. The Puys Noir,\r\nSolas, and La Vache in the Mont Dore Province of central France (after\r\nScrope).]\r\n\r\n=The composite cone.=—The life histories of volcanoes are generally\r\nso varied that lava domes and the pure types of cinder cones are less\r\ncommon than volcanoes in which paroxysmal eruptions have alternated\r\nwith explosions, and where, therefore, the structure of the mountain\r\nrepresents a composite of lava and cinder. Such composite cones possess\r\na skeleton of solid rock upon which have been built up alternate\r\nsloping layers of cinder and lava. In most respects such cones stand in\r\nan intermediate position between lava domes and cinder cones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 123.—The _bocca_ or mouth upon the inner cone of Mount Vesuvius\r\nfrom which flowed the lava stream of 1872. This lava stream appears in\r\nthe foreground with its characteristic “ropy” surface.]\r\n\r\nRegarded as a retaining wall for the lava which mounts in the chimney,\r\nthe cinder cone is obviously the weakest of all. Should lava rise in a\r\ncinder cone without an explosion occurring, the cone is at once broken\r\nthrough upon one side by the outwelling of the lava near the base. Thus\r\narises the characteristic _breached_ cone of horseshoe form (Fig. 122).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 124.—A row of parasitic cones raised above a fissure which was\r\nopened upon the flanks of Mount Etna during the eruption of 1892 (after\r\nDe Lorenzo).]\r\n\r\nQuite in contrast with the weak cinder cone is the lava dome with\r\nits rock walls and relatively flat slopes. Considered as a retaining\r\nwall for lava it is much the strongest type of volcanic mountain, and\r\nit is likely that the hydrostatic pressure of the lava within the\r\ncrater would seldom suffice to rupture the walls, were it not that\r\nthe molten rock first fuses its way into old stream tunnels buried\r\nunder the mountain slopes (see _ante_, p. 112). Composite cones have\r\na strength as retaining walls for lava which is intermediate between\r\nthat of the other types. Their Vulcanian eruptions of the convulsive\r\ntype are initiated by the formation of a rent or fissure upon the\r\nmountain flanks at elevations well above the base, the opening of the\r\nfissure being generally accompanied by a local earthquake of greater or\r\nless violence.\r\n\r\nFrom one or more such fissures the lava issues usually with sufficient\r\nviolence at the place of outflow to build up over it either an enlarged\r\ntype of driblet cone, referred to as a “mouth”, or _bocca_[1] (Fig.\r\n123), or one or more cinder cones which from their position upon the\r\nflanks of the larger volcano are referred to as _parasitic cones_ (Fig.\r\n124). The lava of Vesuvius more frequently yields _bocchi_ at the place\r\nof outflow, whereas the flanks of Etna are pimpled with great numbers\r\nof parasitic cinder cones, each the monument to some earlier eruption\r\n(Fig. 125).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 125.—View looking toward the summit of Etna from a position upon\r\nthe southern flank near the village of Nicolosi. The two breached\r\nparasitic cones seen behind this village are the Monti Rossi which were\r\nthrown up in 1669 and from which flowed the lava which overran Catania\r\n(after a photograph by Sommer).]\r\n\r\nIt is generally the case that a single eruption makes but a relatively\r\nsmall contribution to the bulk of the mountain. From each new cone or\r\n_bocca_ there proceeds a stream of lava spread in a relatively narrow\r\nstream extending down the slopes (Fig. 126).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 126.—Sketch map of Etna, showing the individual surface lava\r\nstreams (in black) and the tuff covered surface (stippled).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The caldera of composite cones.=—Because of the varied episodes\r\nin the history of composite cones, they lack the regular lines\r\ncharacteristic of the two simpler types. The larger number of the more\r\nimportant composite cones have been built up within an outer crater of\r\nrelatively large diameter, the Somma cone or _caldera_, which surrounds\r\nthem like a gigantic ruff or collar. This caldera is clearly in most\r\ncases at least the relic of an earlier explosive crater, after which\r\nsuccessive eruptions of lesser violence have built a more sharply\r\nconical structure. This can only be interpreted to mean that most\r\nlarger and long-active volcanoes have been born in the grandest throes\r\nof their life history, and that a larger or smaller lateral migration\r\nof the vent has been responsible for the partial destruction of the\r\nexplosion crater. Upon Vesuvius we find the crescent-like rim of Monte\r\nSomma; on Etna it is the Val del Bove, etc. It is this caldera of\r\ncomposite cones which gave rise to the theory of the “elevation crater”\r\nof von Buch (see _ante_, p. 95, and Fig. 127).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 127.—Panum crater, showing the caldera and the later interior\r\ncones (after Russell).]\r\n\r\n=The eruption of Vesuvius in 1906.=—The volcano Vesuvius rises on the\r\nshores of the beautiful bay of Naples only about ten miles distant\r\nfrom the city of Naples. The mountain consists of the remnant of an\r\nearlier broad-mouthed explosion crater, the Monte Somma, and an inner,\r\nmore conical elevation, the Monte Vesuvio. Before the eruption of 1906\r\nthis central cone was sharply conical and rose to a height of about\r\n4300 feet above the surface of the bay, or above the highest point of\r\nthe ancient caldera. The base of this inner cone is at an elevation of\r\nsomething less than half that of the entire mass, and is separated from\r\nthe encircling ring wall of the old crater by the _atrio_, to which\r\ncorresponds in height a perceptible shelf or _piano_ upon the slope\r\ntoward the bay of Naples (Fig. 128).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 128.—View of Mount Vesuvius as it appeared from the Bay of Naples\r\nshortly before the eruption of 1906. The horn to the left is Monte\r\nSomma.]\r\n\r\nAn active composite cone like that of Vesuvius is for the greater part\r\nof the time in the Strombolian condition; that is to say, light crater\r\nexplosions continue with varying intensity and interval, except when\r\nthe mountain has been excited to the periodic Vulcanian outbreaks with\r\nwhich its history has been punctuated. The Strombolian explosions\r\nhave sufficient violence to eject small fragments of hot lava, which,\r\nfalling about the crater, slowly built up a rather sharp cone. The\r\nperiod of Strombolian activity has, therefore, been called the\r\n_cone-producing period_. Just before each new outbreak of the Vulcanian\r\ntype, the altitude of the mountain has, therefore, reached a maximum,\r\nand since the larger explosive eruptions remove portions of this cone\r\nat the same time that they increase the dimensions of the crater,\r\nthe Vulcanian stage in contrast to the other has been called the\r\n_crater-producing period_. In this period, then, the material ejected\r\nduring the explosions does not consist solely of fresh lava cakes,\r\nbut in part of the older débris derived from the crater walls, whence\r\nit is avalanched upon the chimney after each larger explosion. The\r\noverhanging cloud, which during the Strombolian period has consisted\r\nlargely of steam and is noticeably white, now assumes a darker tone,\r\nthe “smoke” which characterizes the Vulcanian eruption.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 129.—A series of consecutive sketches of the summit of the\r\nVesuvian cone, showing the modifications in its outline (after Sir\r\nWilliam Hamilton).]\r\n\r\nOn several historical occasions the cone of Vesuvius has been lowered\r\nby several hundred feet, the greatest of relatively recent truncations\r\nhaving occurred in 1822 and in 1906. Between Vulcanian eruptions the\r\nStrombolian activity is by no means uniform, and so the upward growth\r\nof the cone is subject to lesser interruptions and truncations (Fig.\r\n129).\r\n\r\nThe Vesuvian eruption of 1906 has been selected as a type of the\r\nlarger Vulcanian eruption of composite cones, because it combined the\r\nexplosive and paroxysmal elements, and because it has been observed and\r\nstudied with greater thoroughness than any other. The latest previous\r\neruption of the Vulcanian order had occurred in 1872. Some two years\r\nlater the period of active cone building began and proceeded with\r\nsuch rapidity that by 1880 the new cone began to appear above the rim\r\nof the crater of 1872. From this time on occasional light eruptions\r\ninterrupted the upbuilding process, and as the repairs were not in\r\nall cases completed before a new interruption, a nest of cones, each\r\nsmaller than the last, arose in series like the outdrawn sections of\r\nan old-time spyglass. At one time no less than five concentric craters\r\nwere to be seen.\r\n\r\nFor a brief period in the fall of 1904 Vesuvius had been in almost\r\nabsolute repose, but soon thereafter the Strombolian crater explosions\r\nwere resumed. On May 25, 1905, a small stream of lava began to issue\r\nfrom a fissure high up upon the central cone, and from this time on\r\nthe lava continued to flow down to the valley or _atrio_, separating\r\nthe inner cone from the caldera remnant of Monte Somma. Seen in the\r\nnight, this stream of lava appeared from Naples like a red hot wire\r\nlaid against the mountain’s side (Fig. 130). With gradual augmentation\r\nof Strombolian explosions and increase in volume of the flowing lava\r\nstream, the same condition continued until the first days of April in\r\n1906. The flowing lava had then overrun the tracks of the mountain\r\nrailway and accumulated in considerable quantity within the _atrio_\r\n(Fig. 131).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 130.—Night view of Vesuvius from Naples before the outbreak of\r\n1906. A small lava stream is seen descending from a high point upon the\r\ncentral cone (after Mercalli).]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of April 4, a preliminary stage of the eruption was\r\ninaugurated by the opening of a new radial fissure about 500 feet\r\nbelow the summit of the cone (Fig. 132 _a_), and by early afternoon\r\nthe cone-destroying stage began with the rise of a dark “cauliflower\r\ncloud” or _pino_ to replace the lighter colored steam cloud. The\r\ncone was beginning to fall into the crater, and old lava débris was\r\nmingled in the ejections with the lava clots blown from the still fluid\r\nmaterial within the chimney. From now on short and snappy lightning\r\nflashes played about the black cloud, giving out a sharp staccato\r\n“tack-a-tack.” The volume and density of the cloud and the intensity\r\nof the crater explosions continued to increase until the culmination\r\non April 7. On April 5 at midnight a new lava mouth appeared upon\r\nthe same fissure which had opened near the summit, but now some 300\r\nfeet lower (Fig. 132 _b_). The lava now welled out in larger volume\r\ncorresponding to its greater head, and the stream which for ten months\r\nhad been flowing from the highest outlet upon the cone now ceased to\r\nflow. The next morning, April 6, at about 8 o’clock, lava broke out at\r\nseveral points some distance east of the opening _b_, and evidently\r\nupon another fissure transverse to the first (Fig. 132 _c_). The lava\r\nsurface within the chimney must still have remained near its old\r\nlevel,—effective draining had not yet begun,—since early upon the\r\nfollowing morning a small outflow began nearly at the top of the cone\r\nupon the opposite side and at least a thousand feet higher.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 131.—Scoriaceous lava encroaching upon the tracks\r\nof the Vesuvian railway (after a photograph by Sommer).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 132.—Map of Vesuvius, showing the position and order of formation\r\nof the lava mouths upon its flanks during the eruption of 1906 (after\r\nJohnston-Lavis).]\r\n\r\nThe culmination of the eruption came in the evening of April 7, when,\r\nto the accompaniment of light earthquakes felt as far as Naples, lava\r\nissued for the first time in great volume from a mouth more than\r\nhalfway down the mountain side (Fig. 132 _f_), and thus began the\r\ndrainage of the chimney. At about the same time with loud detonations\r\na huge black cloud rose above the crater in connection with heavy\r\nexplosions, and a rain of cinder was general in the region about the\r\nmountain but especially within the northeast quadrant. Those who were\r\nso fortunate as to be in Pompeii had a clear view of the mountain’s\r\nsummit where red hot masses of lava were thrown far into the air. The\r\ndirection of these projections was reported to have been not directly\r\nupward, but inclined toward the northeast quadrant of the mountain; but\r\nsince with a northeast surface wind the heaviest deposit of ash and\r\ndust should have been upon the southwestern quadrant of the mountain,\r\nit is evident that the material was carried upward until it reached the\r\ncontrary upper currents of the atmosphere, to be by them distributed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 133.—The ash curtain which had overhung Vesuvius\r\nlifting and disclosing the outlines of the mountain on April 10, 1911\r\n(after De Lorenzo).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 134.—The central cone of Vesuvius as it appeared after the\r\neruption of 1906, but with the earlier profile indicated. The\r\ntruncation represents a lowering of the summit by some five hundred\r\nfeet, with corresponding increase in the diameter of the crater (after\r\nJohnston-Lavis).]\r\n\r\nWhen the heavy curtain of ash, which now for a number of succeeding\r\ndays overhung all the circum-Vesuvian country, began to lift (Fig.\r\n133), it was seen that the summit of the cone had been truncated\r\nan average of some 500 feet (Fig. 134). All the slopes and much of\r\nthe surrounding country had the aspect of being buried beneath a\r\ncocoa-colored snow of a depth to the northeastward of several feet,\r\nwhere it had drifted into all the hollow ways so as almost to efface\r\nthem (Fig. 135). More than thrice as heavy as water, the weak roof\r\ntimbers of the houses at the base of the mountain gave way beneath the\r\nadded load upon them, thus making many victims. Inasmuch, however, as\r\nthe ash-fall partakes of the same general characters as in eruptions\r\nfrom cinder cones, we may here give our attention especially to the\r\nstreams of lava which issued upon the opposite flank of the mountain\r\n(Fig. 136).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 135.—A sunken road filled with indrifted cocoa-colored ash from\r\nthe Vesuvian eruption of 1906.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 136.—View of Vesuvius taken from the southwest during the waning\r\nstages of the eruption of 1906. In the middle distance may be discerned\r\nthe several lava mouths aligned upon a fissure, and the courses of the\r\nstreams which descend from them. In the foreground is the main lava\r\nstream with scoriaceous surface (after W. Prinz).]\r\n\r\nThe main lava stream descended the first steep slopes with the velocity\r\nof a mile in twenty-five minutes, about the strolling speed of a\r\npedestrian, but this rate was gradually reduced as the stream advanced\r\nfarther from the mouth. Taking advantage of each depression of the\r\nsurface, the black stream advanced slowly but relentlessly toward\r\nthe cities at the southwest base of the mountain. With a motion not\r\nunlike that of a heap of coal falling over itself down a slope, the\r\nblock lava advances without burning the objects in its path (Fig.\r\n137).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 137.—The main lava stream of 1906 advancing upon the village of\r\nBoscotrecase.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 138.—An Italian pine snapped off by the lava and carried forward\r\nupon its surface as a passenger (after Haug).]\r\n\r\nThe beautiful pines are merely charred where snapped off and are\r\ncarried forward upon the surface of the stream (Fig. 138). When a real\r\nobstruction, such as a bridge or a villa, is encountered, the stream is\r\nat first halted, but the rear crowding upon the van, unless a passage\r\nis found at the side, the lava front rises higher and higher until by\r\nits weight the obstruction is forced to give way (Figs. 139 and 140).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 139.—Lava front both pushing over and running around a wall which\r\nlies athwart its course (after Johnston-Lavis).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 140.—One of the villas in Boscotrecase which was ruined by the\r\nVesuvian lava flow of 1906. The fragments of masonry from the ruined\r\nwalls traveled upon the lava current, where they sometimes became\r\nincased in lava.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The sequence of events within the chimney.=—The thorough study of\r\nthis Vesuvian eruption has placed us in a position to infer with\r\nsome confidence in our conclusions the sequence of events within the\r\nchimney and crater of the volcano, both before and during the eruption.\r\nAnticipating some conclusions derived from the observed dissection of\r\nvolcanoes, which will be discussed below, it may be stated that what\r\nmight be termed the core of the composite cone—the chimney—is a more\r\nor less cylindrical plug of cooled lava which during the active period\r\nof the vent has an interior bore of probably variable caliber. This\r\nplug in its lower section appears in solid black in all the diagrams\r\nof Fig. 141. During the cone-building period (Fig. 141 _a_ and _b_)\r\nthe plug is obviously built upward along with the cone, for lava often\r\nflows out at a level a few hundred feet only below the crater rim. By\r\nwhat process this chimney building goes on is not well understood,\r\nthough some light is thrown upon it by the post-eruption stage of Mont\r\nPelé in 1902-1903 (see below).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 141.—Three diagrams to illustrate the sequence of events\r\nwithin the crater of a composite cone during the cone-building and\r\ncrater-producing periods. _a_ and _b_, two successive stages of the\r\ncone building or Strombolian period; _c_, enlargement of the crater,\r\ntruncation of the cone, and destruction of the upper chimney during the\r\nrelatively brief crater-producing or Vulcanian period.]\r\n\r\nBoth the older and newer sections of this plug or chimney are furnished\r\nsome support against the outward pressure of the contained lava by\r\nthe surrounding wall of tuff; and they are, therefore, in a condition\r\nnot unlike that of the inner barrel of a great gun over which sleeves\r\nof metal have been shrunk so as to give support against bursting\r\npressures. On the other hand, when not sustaining the hydrostatic\r\npressure of the liquid lava within, the chimney would tend to be\r\ncrushed in by the pressure of the surrounding tuff. Its strength to\r\nwithstand bursting pressures is dependent not alone upon the thickness\r\nof its rock walls, but also upon its internal diameter or caliber. A\r\nsteam cylinder of given thickness of wall, as is well known, can resist\r\nbursting pressures in proportion as its internal diameter is small. So\r\nin the volcanic chimney, any tendency to remelt from within the chimney\r\nwalls must weaken them in a twofold ratio.\r\n\r\nWe are yet without accurate temperature observations upon the lava in\r\nvolcanic chimneys, but it seems almost certain that these temperatures\r\nrise as the Vulcanian stage is approaching, and such elevation of\r\ntemperature must be followed by a greater or less re-fusion of the\r\nchimney walls. The sequence of events during the late Vesuvian eruption\r\nis, then, naturally explained by progressive re-fusion and consequent\r\nweakening of the chimney walls, thus permitting a radial fissure to\r\nopen near the top and gradually extend downwards. Thus at first small\r\nand high outlets were opened insufficient to drain the chimney, but\r\nlater, on April 7, after this fissure had been much extended and a new\r\nand larger one had opened at a lower level, the draining began and the\r\nsurface of lava commenced rapidly to sink.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 142.—The spine of Pelé rising above the chimney of\r\nthe volcano after the eruption of 1902 (after Hovey).]\r\n\r\nWhen the rapid sinking of the lava surface occurred, the lower lava\r\nlayers were almost immediately relieved of pressure, thus causing a\r\nsudden expansion of the contained steam and resulting in grand crater\r\nexplosions. The partially refused and fissured upper chimney, now\r\nunable to withstand the inward pressure of the surrounding tuff walls,\r\nsince outward pressures no longer existed, crushed in and contributed\r\nits materials and those of the surrounding tuff to the fragments of\r\nfresh lava rising in volume in the grand explosions (Fig. 141 _c_). In\r\noutline, then, these seem to be the conditions which are indicated by\r\nthe sequence of observed events in connection with the late Vesuvian\r\noutbreak.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 143.—Outlines of the Pelé spine upon successive dates. The full\r\nline represents its outline on December 26, 1902; the dotted-dashed\r\nline is a profile of January 3, 1902; while the dotted line is that of\r\nJanuary 9, 1903. The dark line is a fissure (after E. O. Hovey).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The spine of Pelé.=—The disastrous eruption of Mont Pelé upon\r\nMartinique in the year 1902 is of importance in connection with the\r\ninteresting problem of the upward growth of volcanic chimneys during\r\nthe cone-building period of a volcano. After the conclusion of this\r\ngreat Vulcanian eruption, a spine of lava grew upward from the\r\nchimney of the main crater until it had reached an elevation of more\r\nthen a thousand feet above its base, a figure of the same order of\r\nmagnitude as the probable height of the upper section of the Vesuvian\r\nchimney previous to the eruption of 1906. The Pelé spine (Fig. 142)\r\ndid not grow at a uniform rate, but was subject to smaller or larger\r\ntruncations, but for a period of 18 days the upward growth was at the\r\nrate of about 41 feet per day. Later, the mass split upon a vertical\r\nplane revealing a concave inner surface, and was somewhat rapidly\r\nreduced in altitude to 600 feet (Fig. 143), only to rise again to its\r\nfull height of about 1000 feet some three months later.\r\n\r\nWhile apparently unique as an observed phenomenon, and not free from\r\nuncertainty as to its interpretation, the growth of this obelisk has\r\nat least shown us that a mass of rock can push its way up above the\r\nchimney of an active volcano even when there are no walls of tuff about\r\nit to sustain its outward pressures.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 144.—Corrugated surface of the Vesuvian cone after the mud flows\r\nwhich followed the eruption in 1906 (after Johnston-Lavis).]\r\n\r\n=The aftermath of mud flows.=—When the late Vulcanian explosions of\r\nVesuvius had come to an end, all slopes of the mountain, but especially\r\nthe higher ones, were buried in thick deposits of the cocoa-colored\r\nash, included in which were larger and smaller projectiles. As this\r\nmaterial is extremely porous, it greedily sucks up the water which\r\nfalls during the first succeeding rains. When nearly saturated, it\r\nbegins to descend the slopes of the mountain and soon develops a\r\nvelocity quite in contrast with that of the slow-moving lava. The upper\r\nslopes are thus denuded, while the fields and even the houses about the\r\nbase are invaded by these torrents of mud (_lava d’acqua_). Inasmuch as\r\nthese mud flows are the inevitable aftermath of all grander explosive\r\neruptions, the Italian government has of late spent large sums of\r\nmoney in the construction of dikes intended to arrest their progress\r\nin the future. It was streams of this sort that buried the city of\r\nHerculaneum after the explosive eruption of 79 A.D.\r\n\r\nAfter the mud flows have occurred, the Vesuvian cone, like all\r\nsimilar volcanic cones under the same conditions, is found with deep\r\nradial corrugations (Fig. 144), such as were long ago described as\r\n“barrancoes” and supposed to support the “elevation crater” theory of\r\nvolcano formation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The dissection of volcanoes.=—To the uninitiated it might appear a\r\nhopeless undertaking to attempt to learn by observation the internal\r\nstructure of a volcano, and especially of a complex volcano of the\r\ncomposite type. The earliest successful attempt appears to have been\r\nmade by Count Caspar von Sternberg in order to prove the correctness\r\nof the theory of his friend, the poet Goethe. Goethe had claimed that\r\na little hill in the vicinity of Eger, on the borders of Bohemia, was\r\nan extinct volcano, though the foremost geologist of the time the\r\nfamous Werner, had promulgated the doctrine that this hill, in common\r\nwith others of similar aspect, originated in the combustion of a bed\r\nof coal. The elevation in question, which is known as the Kammerbühl,\r\nconsists mainly of cinder, and Goethe had maintained that if a tunnel\r\nwere to be driven horizontally into the mountain from one of its\r\nslopes, a core or plug of lava would be encountered beneath the summit.\r\nThe excavations, which were completed in 1837, fully verified the\r\npoet’s view, for a lava plug was found to occupy the center of the mass\r\nand to connect with a small lava stream upon the side of the hill (Fig.\r\n145).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 145.—The Kammerbühl near Eger, showing the tunnel completed in\r\n1837 which proved the volcanic nature of the mountain (after Judd).]\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, to such expensive projects that reference is here\r\nmade, but rather to processes which are continually going on in nature,\r\nand on a far grander scale. The most important dissecting agent for our\r\npurpose is running water, which is continually paring down the earth’s\r\nsurface and disclosing its buried structures. How much more convincing\r\nthan any results of artificial excavation, as evidence of the internal\r\nstructure of a volcano, is the monument represented in Fig. 146,\r\nsince here the lava plug stands in relief like a gigantic thumb still\r\nsurrounded by a remnant of cinder deposits. Such exposed chimneys of\r\nformer volcanoes are found in many regions, and have become known as\r\nvolcanic _necks_, _pipes_, or _plugs_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 146.—Volcanic plug exposed by natural dissection\r\nof a volcanic cone in Colorado (U. S. G. S.).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 147.—A dike cutting beds of tuff in a partly dissected volcano of\r\nsouthwestern Colorado (after Howe, U. S. G. S.).]\r\n\r\nNot infrequently the beds of tuff composing the flanks of the volcano,\r\nupon dissection by the same process, bring to light walls of cooled\r\nlava standing in relief (Fig. 147)—the filling of the fissure which\r\ngave outlet to the flanks of the mountain at the time of the eruption.\r\nStudy of exposed dikes formed in connection with recent eruptions of\r\nVesuvius has shown that in many instances they are still hollow, the\r\nlava having drained from them before complete consolidation.\r\n\r\nAnother agent which is effective in uncovering the buried structures\r\nof volcanoes is the action of waves on shores. Always a relatively\r\nvigorous erosive agency, the softer structures of volcanic cones are\r\nremoved with especial facility by this agent. On the shores of the\r\nisland of Volcano, the little cone of Vulcanello has been nearly half\r\ncarried away by the waves, so as to reveal with especial perfection the\r\nstructure of the cinder beds as well as the internal rock skeleton of\r\nthe mass. Here the characteristic dips of lava streams, intercalated as\r\nthey now are between tuff deposits and the lava which consolidated in\r\nfissures, are both revealed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 148.—Map and general view of St. Paul’s Rocks, a volcanic cone\r\ndissected by waves.]\r\n\r\nIn mid-Atlantic a quite perfect crater, the St. Paul’s Rocks, has been\r\ncut nearly in half so as to produce a natural harbor (Fig. 148).\r\n\r\nIn still other instances we may thank the volcano itself for opening\r\nup the interior of the mountain for our inspection. The eruption in\r\n1888 of the Japanese volcano of Bandai-san, by removing a considerable\r\npart of the ancient cone, has afforded us a section completely through\r\nthe mountain. The summit and one side of the small Bandai was carried\r\ncompletely away, and there was substituted a yawning crater eccentric\r\nto the former mountain and having its highest wall no less than 1500\r\nfeet in height (Fig. 149). In two hours from the first warning of the\r\nexplosion the catastrophe was complete and the eruption over.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 149.—Dissection by explosion of Little Bandai-san in 1888 (after\r\nSekiya).]\r\n\r\nThe eruption of Krakatoa in 1883, probably the grandest observed\r\nvolcanic explosion in historic times, left a volcanic cone divided\r\nalmost in half and open to inspection (Fig. 150). Rakata, Danan,\r\nand Perbuatan had before constituted a line of cones built up round\r\nindividual craters subsequent to the partial destruction of an\r\nearlier caldera, portions of which were still existent in the islands\r\nVerlaten and Lang. By the eruption of 1883 all the exposed parts and\r\nconsiderable submerged portions of the two smaller cones were entirely\r\ndestroyed, and the larger one, known as Rakata, was divided just\r\noutside the plug so as to leave a precipitous wall rising directly from\r\nthe sea and showing lava streams in alternation with somewhat thicker\r\ntuff layers, the whole knit together by numerous lava dikes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 150.—The half-submerged volcano of Krakatoa in the Sunda Straits\r\nbefore and after the eruption of 1883 (after Verbeek).]\r\n\r\nIn order to carry our dissecting process down to levels below the\r\nbase of the volcanic mountain, it is usually necessary to inspect the\r\nresults of erosion by running water. Here the plug or chimney, instead\r\nof being surrounded by tuff, is inclosed by the country rock of the\r\nregion, which is commonly a sedimentary formation. Such exposed lower\r\nsections of volcanic chimneys are numerous along the northwestern\r\nshores of the British Isles. Where aligned upon a dislocation or\r\nnoteworthy fissure in the rocks, the group of plugs has been referred\r\nto as a scar or _cicatrice_ (Fig. 151). Associated with the plugs of\r\nthe cicatrice are not infrequently dikes, or, it may be, sheets of lava\r\nextended between layers of sediment and known as _sills_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 151.—The cicatrice of the Banat (after Suess).]\r\n\r\nIf we are able to continue the dissection process to still greater\r\ndepths, we encounter at last igneous rock having a texture known as\r\ngranitic and indicating that the process of consolidation was not\r\nonly exceedingly slow but also uninterrupted. This rock is found in\r\nmasses of larger dimensions, and though generally of more or less\r\nirregular form, no one dimension is of a different order of magnitude\r\nfrom the others. Such masses are commonly described as _bosses_, or,\r\nif especially large, as _batholites_ (Fig. 152). Wherever the rock\r\nbeds appear as though they had been forced up by the upward pressure\r\nof the igneous mass, the latter takes the form of a mushroom and has\r\nbeen described as a _laccolite_ (Figs. 479-481, pp. 441-442). Evidence\r\nseems, however, to accumulate that in the greater number of cases the\r\nmolten rock has fused its way upward, in part assimilating and in part\r\ninclosing the rock which it encountered. This process of upward fusion\r\nhas been likened to the progress of a red hot iron burning its way\r\nthrough a board.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The formation of lava reservoirs.=—The discarding of the earlier\r\nnotion that the earth has a liquid interior makes it proper in\r\ndiscussing the subject of volcanoes to at least touch upon the origin\r\nof the molten rock material. As already pointed out, such reservoirs as\r\nexist must be local and temporary, or it would be difficult to see how\r\nthe existing condition of earth rigidity could be maintained. From the\r\nrate at which rock temperatures rise, at increasing depths below the\r\nsurface, it is clear that all rocks would be melted at very moderate\r\ndepths only, if they were not kept in a solid state by the prodigious\r\nloads which they sustain. Any relief from this load should at once\r\nresult in fusion of the rock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 152.—Diagram to illustrate a probable cause of formation of lava\r\nreservoirs, and to show the connection between such reservoirs and the\r\nvolcanoes at the surface.]\r\n\r\nNow the restriction of active volcanoes to those zones of the earth’s\r\nsurface within which mountains are rising, and where in consequence\r\nearthquakes are felt, has furnished us at least a clew to the origin\r\nof the lava. Regarded as a structure capable of sustaining a load,\r\nthe competency of an arch is something quite remarkable, so that the\r\narching up of strong rock formations into anticlines within the upper\r\nlayers of the zone of flow, or of combined fracture and flow, would\r\nbe sufficient to remove the load from relatively weak underlying beds,\r\nwhich in consequence would be fused and form local reservoirs of lava\r\n(Figs. 152 and 153).\r\n\r\nIt has been further quite generally observed that lines of volcanoes,\r\nin so far as they betray any relation in position to neighboring\r\nmountain ranges, tend to appear upon the rear or flatter limb of\r\nunsymmetrical arches, or where local tension would favor the opening of\r\nchannels toward the surface. Moreover, wherever recent block movements\r\nof surface portions of the earth’s shell have been disclosed in the\r\nneighborhood of volcanoes, the latter appear to be connected with\r\ndownthrown blocks, as though the lava had, so to speak, been squeezed\r\nout from beneath the depressed block or blocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 153.—Result of experiment with layers of composition to\r\nillustrate the effect of relief of load upon rocks by arching of\r\ncompetent formation (after Willis).]\r\n\r\nWe must not, however, forget that the igneous rocks are greatly\r\nrestricted in the range of their chemical composition. No igneous\r\nrock type is known which could be formed by the fusion of any of\r\nthe carbonate rocks such as limestone or dolomite, or of the more\r\nsiliceous rocks, such as sandstone or quartzite. There remains only\r\nthe argillaceous class of sediments, the shales and slates, and so\r\nsoon as we examine the composition of these rocks we are struck by\r\nthe remarkable resemblance to that of the class of igneous rocks. For\r\npurposes of comparison there is given below the composite or average\r\nconstitution of igneous rocks in parallel column, with the average\r\nattained by combining the analyses of 56 slates and shales, the latter\r\nrecalculated with water excluded:\r\n\r\n\r\n  ══════════════╤══════════════════════════════════╤════════════════\r\n                │     AVERAGE IGNEOUS ROCK         │\r\n                ├——————————————————┬———————————————┤  AVERAGE SHALE\r\n                │    (Clark)       │  (Washington) │\r\n  ——————————————┼——————————————————┼———————————————┼————————————————\r\n                │                  │               │\r\n  SiO_2         │    61.25         │   61.69       │   63.34\r\n  Al_{2}O_3     │    15.81         │   15.94       │   16.56\r\n  Fe_{2}O_3     │     2.70} 6.31   │    1.88} 4.53 │    4.41} 7.89\r\n  FeO           │     3.61}        │    2.65}      │    3.48}\r\n  MgO           │     4.47         │    4.90       │    3.54\r\n  CaO           │     5.03         │    5.02       │    3.33\r\n  Na_{2}O       │     3.64         │    4.09       │    1.29\r\n  K_{2}O        │     2.87         │    3.35       │    3.52\r\n  TiO_2         │      .62         │     .48       │     .53\r\n                │   ——————         │  ——————       │  ——————\r\n                │   100.00         │  100.00       │  100.00\r\n  ══════════════╧══════════════════╧═══════════════╧════════════════\r\n\r\nThis close resemblance is probably of deep significance, for the reason\r\nthat shales and slates are structurally the weakest of all rocks and\r\nfor the further reason that they rather generally directly underlie\r\nthe carbonate rocks, which are by contrast the strongest (see _ante_,\r\np. 37). For these reasons shales and slates are the only rocks which\r\nare likely to be fused by relief from load through the formation of\r\nanticlinal arches within the earth’s zone of flow. If this view is\r\nwell founded, lavas and other igneous rocks are in large part fused\r\nargillaceous sediments formed in connection with the process of\r\nfolding, or are refused rocks of igneous origin and similar composition.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Character profiles.=—The character profiles of features connected in\r\ntheir origin with volcanoes are particularly easy to recognize, and in\r\na few cases in which they might be confused with others of a different\r\norigin, an examination of the materials of the features should lead to\r\na definitive judgment.\r\n\r\nThe lava plains which result from massive outflows of basalt might\r\nperhaps strictly be regarded as lack of feature, so great may be their\r\ncontinuous extent. Wherever definite vents exist, a broad flat dome is\r\nthe usual result of the extravasation of a basaltic lava. The puys of\r\nFrance and many of the Kuppen of Germany, being formed from less fluid\r\nlava, have afforded profiles with relatively small radius of curvature.\r\n\r\nIn its youthful stage, the cinder cone usually presents a broad summit\r\nsag and relatively short side slopes, whereas the cone of later stages\r\nis apt to present long sweeping and upwardly concave curves with both\r\nthe gradient and the radius of curvature increasing rapidly toward\r\nthe summit. In contrast, too, with the earlier stage, the crest is\r\nrelatively small. A marked reduction in the high symmetry of such\r\nprofiles is noted wherever a breaching by lava outflow has occurred\r\n(Fig. 154).\r\n\r\nWith the composite cone, complexity and corresponding lack of symmetry\r\nis introduced, especially in the partially ruined caldera, and by\r\nthe more or less accidental distribution of parasitic cones, as well\r\nas by migrations of the central cone. Peculiarly similar acuminated\r\nprofiles result from spatter-cone formation, from the formation of\r\na superchimney spine, and by the uncovering of the chimney through\r\ndenudational processes—the volcanic neck.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 154.—Character profiles connected with volcanoes.]\r\n\r\nAnother important feature resulting from denudation is the Mesa or\r\ntable mountain with its protecting basalt cap above softer rocks. Its\r\nprofile most resembles that of table mountains due to differential\r\nerosion of alternately strong and weak horizontally bedded rocks, such\r\nas compose the upper portion of the section in the Grand Cañon of the\r\nColorado. Here, however, in place of a single unusually strong top\r\nlayer there are found several strong layers in alternation with weaker\r\nones so as to produce additional steps in the profile.\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING REFERENCES TO CHAPTERS IX AND X\r\n\r\n General works:—\r\n\r\n PAULETT SCROPE.

In the atmosphere are found such active chemical agents as\r\noxygen and carbon dioxide, the so-called carbonic acid gas; and these\r\nagents in the presence of water react chemically with the minerals of\r\nthe rocks and form other minerals such as the hydrates and carbonates,\r\nwhich are lighter in weight and more soluble. This _chemical_ attack\r\nupon the outer shell of the lithosphere is described as _decomposition_.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the rock may succumb to changes which are purely\r\nmechanical and are due either to the stresses set up by differences\r\nbetween surface and interior temperatures, or to the prying action\r\nof the frost in the crevices. Such purely mechanical degeneration\r\nof the rocks is in contrast with decomposition and is described as\r\n_disintegration_. The two processes of decomposition and disintegration\r\nmay, however, go on together; and the changes of volume that are caused\r\nby decomposition may result directly in considerable disintegration, as\r\nwe are to see.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The rôle of the percolating water.=—In order to effect chemical\r\nchange or reaction, it is essential that the substances which are\r\nto react must be brought into such intimate contact with each other\r\nas it is seldom possible to attain except by solution. The chemical\r\nreactions which go on between the gaseous atmosphere and the solid\r\nlithosphere are accomplished through solution of the gases in water.\r\nThis water, derived from rain or snow, percolates into the ground or\r\ndescends along the crevices in the rocks, carrying with it a certain\r\nmeasure of dissolved air. This air differs from that of the surrounding\r\natmospheric envelope by containing relatively large amounts of oxygen\r\nand of the other active element carbon dioxide. It follows from the\r\nimportant rôle thus performed by the percolating water that the process\r\nof decomposition will be relatively important in humid regions where\r\nthe atmospheric precipitation is sufficient for the purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 155.—Successive diagrams to show the effect of decomposition and\r\nresulting disintegration upon joint blocks so as to produce spheroidal\r\nbowlders by weathering.]\r\n\r\nWithin hot and dry regions there is a larger measure of rock\r\ndisintegration, and distinct chemical changes unlike those of humid\r\nregions take place in the higher temperatures and with the more\r\nconcentrated saline solutions. The discussion of such changes will be\r\ndeferred until desert conditions are treated in another chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mechanical results of decomposition—spheroidal weathering.=—From\r\nan earlier chapter it has been learned that the rocks of the earth’s\r\noutermost shell are generally intersected by a system of vertical\r\nfissures which at each locality tend to divide the rock into parallel\r\nand upright rectangular prisms. It is these joints which offer\r\nrelatively easy paths for the descent of the water into the rocks.\r\nIn rocks of sedimentary origin there are found, in addition to the\r\nvertical joints, planes of bedding originally horizontal, and in the\r\nintrusive and volcanic rocks a somewhat similar parting, likewise\r\nparallel to the surface of the ground. The combined effect of the\r\njoints and the additional parting planes is thus to separate the rock\r\nmass into more or less perfect squared blocks (Fig. 155, upper figure)\r\nwhich stand in vertical columns.\r\n\r\nThe water which percolates downward upon the joints, finds its way\r\nlaterally along the parting planes, and so subjects the entire surface\r\nof each block to simultaneous attack by its reagents. Though all\r\nparts of the surface of each block are alike subject to attack, it\r\nis the angles and the edges which are most vigorously acted upon. In\r\nthe narrow crevices the solutions move but sluggishly, and as they\r\nare soon impoverished of their reagents in the attack upon the rock,\r\nfresh solution can reach the middle of the faces from relatively few\r\ndirections. The edges are at the same time being reached from many more\r\ndirections, and the corners from a still larger number.\r\n\r\nThe minerals newly formed by these chemical processes of hydration\r\nand carbonization are notably lighter, and hence more bulky than the\r\nminerals from whose constituents they have been largely formed. Strains\r\nare thus set up which tend to separate the bulkier new material from\r\nthe core of unaltered rock below. As the process continues, distinct\r\nchannels for the moving waters are developed favorable to action at\r\nthe edges and corners of the blocks. Eventually, the squared block is\r\nby this process transformed into a spheroidal core of still unaltered\r\nrock wrapped in layers of decomposed material, like the outer wrappings\r\nof an onion. These in turn are usually imbedded in more thoroughly\r\ndisintegrated material from which the shell structure has disappeared\r\n(Fig. 156).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 156.—Spheroidal weathering of an igneous rock.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Exfoliation or scaling.=—A fact of much importance to geologists, but\r\none far too often overlooked, is that rocks are but poor conductors\r\nfor heat. It results from this that in the bright sun of a summer’s\r\nday a thin skin, as it were, upon the rock surface may be heated to\r\na relatively high temperature, although the layer immediately below\r\nit is practically unaffected. The consequent expansion of the surface\r\nlayer causes stresses that tend to scale it off from the layer below,\r\nwhich, uncovered in its turn, develops new strains of the same sort.\r\nThis process of exfoliation acquires exceptional importance in desert\r\nregions where the rock surfaces are daily elevated to excessively high\r\ntemperatures (see Chapter XV).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 157.—Dome structure in granite mass, Yosemite valley, California\r\n(after a photograph by Sinclair).]\r\n\r\n=Dome structure in granite masses.=—In large granite masses, such\r\nas are to be found in the ranges of the Sierra Nevada of California,\r\na peculiar dome structure is sometimes found developed upon a large\r\nscale, and has had an important influence upon the breaking down of the\r\nrock and upon the shaping of the mountain (Fig. 157). Such a structure,\r\nmade up as it is of prodigious layers, can have little in common with\r\nthe veneers of weathered minerals which are the result of exfoliation,\r\nand it is quite likely that the dome structure is in some way connected\r\nwith the relief of these massive rocks from their load—the rock which\r\nonce rested upon them, but has been carried away by erosion since the\r\nuplift of the range.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The prying work of frost.=—In all countries where winter temperatures\r\nrange below the freezing point of water, a most potent agent of rock\r\ndisintegration is the frost which pries at every crevice and cranny\r\nof the surface rock. Important in the temperate zones, in the polar\r\nregions it becomes almost the sole effective agent of rock weathering.\r\nThere, as elsewhere, its efficiency as a disintegrating agent is\r\ndirectly dependent upon the nature of the crevices within the rock, so\r\nthat the omnipresent joints are able to exercise a degree of control\r\nover the sculpturing of the surface features which is hardly to be\r\nlooked for elsewhere (see plate 10 A).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 158.—Talus slope beneath a cliff.]\r\n\r\n=Talus.=—Wherever the earth’s surface rises in steep cliffs, the\r\nrock fragments derived from frost action, or by other processes of\r\ndisintegration, as they become detached either fall or slide rapidly\r\ndownward until arrested upon a flatter slope. Upon the earlier\r\naccumulations of this kind, the later ones are deposited, until their\r\nsurface slopes up to the cliff face as steeply as the material will\r\nlie—the angle of repose. Such débris accumulations at the base of a\r\ncliff (Fig. 158) are known as _talus_, and the slope is described as a\r\ntalus slope, or in Scotland as a “scree.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 159.—Striped ground from soil flow of chipped rock fragments upon\r\na slope, Snow Hill Island, West Antarctica (after Otto Nordenskiöld).]\r\n\r\n=Soil flow in the continued presence of thaw water.=—So soon as the\r\nrocks are broken down by the weathering processes, they are easily\r\nmoved, usually to lower levels. In part this transportation may be\r\naccomplished by gravity slowly acting upon the disintegrated rock and\r\ncausing it to creep down the slope. Yet even in such cases water is\r\nusually present in quantity sufficient to fill the spaces between the\r\ngrains, and so act as a lubricant to facilitate the migration.\r\n\r\nUpon a large scale rocks which were either originally incoherent or\r\nhave been made so by weathering, after they have become saturated with\r\nwater, may start into sudden motion as great landslides or avalanches,\r\nwhich in the space of a few moments materially change the face of the\r\ncountry, and by burying the bottom lands leave disaster and misery in\r\ntheir wake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 160.—Pavement of horizontal surface due to soil flow, Spitzbergen\r\n(after Otto Nordenskiöld).]\r\n\r\nWithin the subpolar regions, where a large part of the surface is for\r\nmuch of the year covered with snow, the underlying rocks are for long\r\nperiods saturated with thaw water, and in alternation are repeatedly\r\nfrozen and thawed. Essentially similar conditions are met with in the\r\nhigh, snow-capped mountains of temperate or torrid regions. For the\r\nsubpolar regions particularly it is now generally recognized that\r\nsomewhat special processes of soil flow, described under the name\r\n_solifluction_, are characteristic. The exact nature of these processes\r\nis as yet imperfectly understood, but there can be little doubt\r\nconcerning the large rôle which they have played in the transportation\r\nof surface materials. Such soil flow is clearly manifested under\r\ndifferent aspects, and it is likely that by this comprehensive term\r\ndistinct processes have been brought together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 161.—Tree roots entering fissured rock and prying its sections\r\napart.]\r\n\r\nPossibly the most striking aspect of the soil flow in subpolar regions\r\nis furnished by the remarkable “stone rivers” and “rock glaciers”;\r\nthough the more generally characteristic are peculiar stripings or\r\nother markings which appear upon the surface of the ground and thus\r\nbetray the movements of the underlying materials. Upon slopes it is not\r\nuncommon for the surface to be composed of angular rock fragments riven\r\nby the frost and crossed by broad parallel furrows as though a gigantic\r\nplow had gone over it (Fig. 159). The direction of the furrows is\r\nalways up and down the slope, and the striping is marked in proportion\r\nas the slope is steep. Where the bottom is reached, the furrows are\r\nreplaced by a sort of mosaic pavement of hexagonal repeating figures,\r\neach of which may be an area of the surface six feet or more across\r\n(Fig. 160, and Fig. 390, p. 368). The depressions which separate the\r\n“blocks” of the pavement are often filled with clay, while the inclosed\r\nsurfaces are made up of coarsely chipped stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The splitting wedges of roots and trees.=—In the mechanical breakdown\r\nof the rocks within humid regions a not unimportant part is sometimes\r\ntaken by the trees, which insinuate the tenuous extremities of their\r\nrootlets into the smallest cracks and by continued growth slowly wedge\r\neven the firmer rocks apart (Fig. 161). In a similar manner the small\r\ntree trunk growing within a crevice of the rock may in time split its\r\nparts asunder (Fig. 162).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 162.—A large glacial bowlder split by a growing tree near East\r\nLansing, Michigan (after a photograph by Bertha Thompson).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The rock mantle and its shield in the mat of vegetation.=—Through\r\nthe action of weathering, the rocks, as we have seen, lose their\r\nintegrity within a surface layer, which, though it may be as much as a\r\nhundred feet or more in thickness, must still be accounted a mere film\r\nabove the underlying bed rock. The mechanical agents of the breakdown\r\noperate only within a few feet of the surface, and the agents of rock\r\ndecomposition, derived as they are from the atmosphere, become inert\r\nbefore they have descended to any considerable depth. The surface layer\r\nof incoherent rock is usually referred to as the _rock mantle_ (Fig.\r\n163). Where the rock mantle is relatively deep, as it is in the states\r\nsouth of the Ohio in the eastern United States, there is found, deep\r\nbelow the outer layer of soil, a partially decomposed and disintegrated\r\nrock, of which the unaltered minerals lie unchanged in position but\r\nseparated by the new minerals which have resulted from the breakdown\r\nof their more susceptible associates. While thus in a certain sense\r\npossessing the original structure, this altered material is essentially\r\nincoherent and easily succumbs to attack by the pick and spade, so that\r\nit is only at considerably greater depths that the unaltered rock is\r\nencountered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 163.—Rock mantle consisting of broken rock, above which is\r\nsoil and a vegetable mat. Coast of California (after a photograph by\r\nFairbanks).]\r\n\r\nBecause of the tendency of mantle rock to creep down upon slopes it is\r\ngenerally found thicker upon the crests and at the bases of hills and\r\nthinnest upon their slopes (Fig. 164).\r\n\r\nIn the transformation of the upper portion of the mantle rock into\r\nsoil, additional chemical processes to those of weathering are carried\r\nthrough by the agency of earthworms, bacteria, and other organisms, and\r\nby the action of humus and other acids derived from the decomposition\r\nof vegetation. The bacteria particularly play a part in the formation\r\nof carbonates, as they do also in changing the nitrogen of the air\r\ninto nitrates which become available as plant food. Within the humid\r\ntropical regions ants and other insects enter as a large factor in rock\r\ndecomposition, as they do also in producing not unimportant surface\r\nirregularities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 164.—Diagram to show the varying thickness of mantle rock\r\nupon the different portions of a hill surface (after Chamberlin and\r\nSalisbury).]\r\n\r\nHow important is the cover of vegetation in retaining the rock\r\nmantle and the upper soil layer in their respective positions, as\r\nrequired for agricultural purposes, may be best illustrated by the\r\ndisastrous consequences of allowing it to be destroyed. Wherever, by\r\nthe destruction of forests, by the excessive grazing of animals, or\r\nby other causes, the mat of turf has been destroyed, the surface is\r\nopened in gullies by the first hard rain, and the fertile layer of soil\r\nis carried from the slopes and distributed with the coarser mantle\r\nupon the bottom lands. Thus the face of the country is completely\r\ntransformed from fertile hills into the most desolate of deserts where\r\nno spear of grass is to be seen and no animal food to be obtained\r\n(plate 5 A). The soil once washed away is not again renewed, for the\r\ncontinuation of the gullying process now effectively prevents its\r\naccumulation.\r\n\r\n┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n│  PLATE 5.                                                      │\r\n│                                                                │\r\n│ [Illustration: _A._ Once wooded region in China now reduced to │\r\n│ desert                                                         │\r\n│ through deforestation (after Willis).]                         │\r\n│                                                                │\r\n│ [Illustration: _B._ “Bad Lands” in the Colorado Desert (after  │\r\n│ Mendenhall).]                                                  │\r\n└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\r\n\r\n\r\n READING REFERENCES TO CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n Decomposition and disintegration:—\r\n\r\n GEORGE P.

We have\r\nseen how, for short distances, gravity unaided may pile up the débris\r\nin accumulations of talus, and how, when assisted by thaw water which\r\nhas soaked into the material, it may accomplish a slow migration by a\r\npeculiar type of soil flow. Yet far more potent transporting agencies\r\nare at work, and of these the one of first importance is running\r\nwater. Only in the hearts of great deserts or in the equally remote\r\nwhite deserts of the polar regions is the sound of its murmurings\r\nnever heard. Every other part of the earth’s surface has at some time\r\nits running water coursing in valleys which it has itself etched into\r\nthe surface. It is this etching out of the continents in an intricate\r\npattern of anastomosing valleys which constitutes the chief difference\r\nbetween the land surface and the relatively even floor of the oceans.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The motive power of rivers.=—Every river is born in throes of Mother\r\nEarth by which the land is uplifted and left at a higher level than\r\nit was before. It is the difference of elevation thus brought about\r\nbetween separated portions of the land areas that makes it possible for\r\nthe water which falls upon the higher portions to descend by gravity to\r\nthe lower. This natural “head” due to differences of elevation is the\r\nmotive power of the local streams, and for each increase in elevation\r\nthere is an immediate response in renewed vigor of the streams. The\r\nelevated area off which the rivers flow is here termed an upland.\r\n\r\nThe velocity of a stream will be dependent not only upon the difference\r\nin altitude between its source and its mouth, but upon the distance\r\nwhich separates them, since this will determine the grade. The level\r\nof the mouth being the lowest which the stream can reach is termed\r\nthe _base level_, and the current is fixed by the slope or declivity.\r\nThe capacity to lift and transport rock débris is augmented at a quite\r\nsurprising rate with every increase in current velocity, the law being\r\nthat the weight of the heaviest transportable fragment varies with the\r\nsixth power of the velocity of the current. Thus if one stream flows\r\ntwice as rapidly as another, it can transport fragments which are\r\nsixty-four times as heavy.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Old land and new land.=—The uplifts of the continents may proceed\r\nwithout changes in the position of the shore lines, in which case\r\nareas, already carved by streams but no longer actively modified by\r\nthem, are worked upon by tools freshly sharpened and driven by greater\r\npower. The land thus subjected to active stream cutting is described\r\nas old land, and has already had engraved upon it the characteristic\r\npattern of river etchings, albeit the design has been in part effaced.\r\n\r\nIf, upon the other hand, the shore line migrates seaward with the\r\nuplift, a portion of the relatively even sea floor, or new land, is\r\nelevated and laid under the action of the running water. As we are to\r\nsee, stream cutting is to some extent modified when a river pattern is\r\ninherited from the uplift. The uplift, whether of old land only or of\r\nboth old land and new land, marks the starting point of a new river\r\nhistory, usually described as an _erosion cycle_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 165.—Two successive forms of gullies from the\r\nearliest stage of a river’s life (after Salisbury and Atwood).]\r\n\r\n=The earlier aspects of rivers.=—Though geologists have sometimes\r\nregarded the uplift of the continents as a sort of upwarping in a\r\ncontinuous curved surface, the discussions of river histories and\r\nthe pictorial illustrations of them have alike clearly assumed that\r\nthe uplift has been essentially in blocks and that the elevated area\r\nmeets the lower lying country or the sea in a more or less definite\r\nescarpment. The first rivers to develop after the uplift may be\r\ndescribed as gullies shaped by the sudden downrush of storm waters and\r\nspaced more or less regularly along the margin of the escarpment (Fig.\r\n165). These gullies are relatively short, straight, and steep; they\r\nhave precipitous walls and few, if any, tributaries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 166.—Partially dissected upland (after Salisbury\r\nand Atwood).]\r\n\r\nWith time the gully heads advance into the upland as they take on\r\ntributaries; and so at length they in part invest it and dissect it\r\ninto numerous irregularly bounded and flat-topped tables which are\r\nseparated by cañons (Fig. 166). At the same time the grade of the\r\nchannel is becoming flatter, and its precipitous walls are being\r\nreplaced by curving slopes, as will be more fully described in the\r\nsequel. It is because of this progressive reduction of grades with\r\nincreasing age that the early stages of a river’s life are much the\r\nmost turbulent of its history. The water then rushes down the steep\r\ngrades in rapids, and is often at times opened out in some basin to\r\nform a lake where differences of uplift have been characteristic of\r\nneighboring sections. For several reasons such basins in the course of\r\na stream are relatively short lived (Chapter XXX), and they disappear\r\nwith the earlier stages of the river history.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The meshes of the river network.=—From the continued throwing out\r\nof new tributaries by the streams, the meshes in the river network\r\ndraw more closely together as the stages of its history advance. The\r\ncloseness of texture which is at last developed upon the upland is in\r\npart determined by the quantity of rainfall, so that in New Jersey with\r\nheavy annual precipitation the meshes in the network are much smaller\r\nthan they are, for example, upon the semiarid or arid plains of the\r\nwestern United States. Its design will, however, in either case more\r\nor less clearly express the plan of rock architecture which is hidden\r\nbeneath the surface (Chapter XVII).\r\n\r\n\r\n=The upper and lower reaches of a river contrasted.=—From the fact\r\nthat the river progressively invades new portions of the upland and\r\nlays the acquired sections under more and more thorough investment, it\r\nhas near its headwaters for a long time a frontier district which may\r\nbe regarded as youthful even though the sections near its mouth have\r\nreached a somewhat advanced stage. The newly acquired sections of river\r\nvalley may thus possess the steep grade and precipitous walls which are\r\ncharacteristic of early gullies and cañons and are in contrast with the\r\nmore rounded and flat-bottomed sections below. Lateral streams, from\r\nthe fact that they are newer than the main or trunk stream to which\r\nthey are tributary, likewise descend upon somewhat steeper grades (Fig.\r\n167).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 167.—Characteristic longitudinal sections of the\r\nupper portion of a river valley and its tributaries (after scaled\r\nsections by Nussbaum).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The balance between degradation and aggradation.=—We have seen\r\nthat the power to transport rock fragments is augmented at a most\r\nsurprising rate with every increase in the current velocity. While the\r\nlighter particles of rock may be carried as high up as the surface of\r\nthe water, the heavier ones are moved forward upon the bottom with\r\na combined rolling and hopping motion aided by local eddies. Those\r\nparticles which come in contact with the bottom or sides of the\r\nchannel abrade its surface so as ever to deepen and widen the valley.\r\nThis cutting accomplished by partially suspended débris in rapidly\r\nmoving currents of water is known as _corrasion_ and the stream is said\r\nto be _incising_ its valley.\r\n\r\nAs the current is checked upon the lower and flatter grades, some of\r\nits load of sediment, and especially the coarser portion, will be\r\ndeposited and so partially fill in the channel. A nice balance is thus\r\nestablished between _degradation_ and the contrasted process known\r\nas _aggradation_. The older the river valley the flatter become the\r\ngrades at any section of its course, and thus the point which separates\r\nthe lower zone of aggradation from the upper one of degradation moves\r\nsteadily upstream with the lapse of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The accordance of tributary valleys.=—It is a consequence of the\r\ngreat sensitiveness of stream corrasion to current velocity that\r\nno side stream may enter the trunk valley at a level above that\r\nof the main stream—the tributary streams enter the trunk stream\r\n_accordantly_. Each has carved its own valley, and any abrupt increase\r\nin gradient of the side streams near where they enter the main stream\r\nwould have increased the local corrasion at an accelerated rate and so\r\nhave cut down the channel to the level of the trunk stream.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The grading of the flood plain.=—All rivers are subject to seasonal\r\nvariations in the volume of their waters. Where there are wet and\r\ndry seasons these differences are greatest, and for a large part of\r\nthe year the valleys in such regions may be empty of water, and are\r\nin fact often utilized for thoroughfares. In the temperate climates\r\nof middle latitudes rivers are generally flooded in the spring when\r\nthe winter snows are melted, though they may dwindle to comparatively\r\nsmall streams during the late summer. In the upper reaches of the\r\nriver the current velocities are such that the usual river channel may\r\ncarry all the water of flood time; but lower down and in the zone of\r\naggradation, where the current has been checked, the level of the water\r\nrises in flood above the banks of its usual channel and spreads over\r\nthe surrounding lowlands. As a deposit of sediment is spread upon the\r\nsurface, the succession of the annual deposits from this source raises\r\nthe general level as a broad floor described as the _flood plain_ of\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The cycles of stream meanders.=—The annual flooding with water\r\nand simultaneous deposition of silt is not, however, the only\r\ngrading process which is in operation upon the flood plain. It is\r\ncharacteristic of swift currents that their course is maintained\r\nin relatively straight lines because of the inertia of the rapidly\r\nmoving water. In proportion as their currents become sluggish, rivers\r\nare turned aside by the smallest of obstructions; and once diverted\r\nfrom their straight course, a law of nature becomes operative which\r\nincreases the curvature of the stream at an accelerated rate up to\r\na critical point, when by a change, sudden and catastrophic, a new\r\nand direct course is taken, to be in its turn carried through a\r\nsimilar cycle of changes. This so-called _meandering_ of a stream is\r\naccompanied by a transfer of sediment from one bend or meander of the\r\nriver to those below and from one bank to the other. Inasmuch as the\r\nlater meanders cross the earlier ones and in time occupy all portions\r\nof the plain to the same average extent, a process of rough grading is\r\naccomplished to which the annual overflow deposit is supplementary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 168.—Map and sections of a stream meander. The course of the main\r\ncurrent is indicated by the dashed line.]\r\n\r\nThe course of the current in consecutive meanders and the cross\r\nsections of the channel which result directly from the meandering\r\nprocess will be made clear from examination of Fig. 168. So soon\r\nas diverted from its direct course, the current, by its inertia of\r\nmotion, is thrown against the outer or convex side so as to scour or\r\ncorrade that bank. Upon the concave or inner side of the curve there\r\nis in consequence an area of slack water, and here the silt scoured\r\nfrom higher meanders is deposited. The scouring of the current upon\r\nthe outer bank and the filling upon the inner thus gives to the cross\r\nsection of the stream a generally unsymmetrical character (Fig. 168\r\n_ab_). Between meanders near the point of inflection of the curve, and\r\nthere only, the current is centered in the middle of the channel and\r\nthe cross section is symmetrical (Fig. 168 _cd_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 169.—Tree in part undermined upon the outer bank\r\nof a meander.]\r\n\r\nThe scour upon the convex side of a meander causes the river to swing\r\never farther in that direction, and through invasion of the silted\r\nflood plain to migrate across it. Trees which lie in its path are\r\nundermined and fall outward in the stream with tops directed with the\r\ncurrent (Fig. 169). Whenever the flood plain is forested, the fallen\r\ntrees may be so numerous as to lie in ranks along the shore, and at the\r\ntime of the next flood they are carried downstream to jam in narrow\r\nplaces along the channel and give the erroneous impression that the\r\nflood has itself uprooted a section of forest (see p. 418).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 170.—Diagrams to show the successive positions of stream meanders\r\nand the relatively stationary point near the sharpest curvature.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The cut-off of the meander.=—As the meander swings toward its\r\nextreme position it becomes more and more closely looped. Adjacent\r\nloops thus approach nearer and nearer to each other, but in the\r\nsuccessive positions a nearly stationary point is established near\r\nwhere the river makes its sharpest turn (Fig. 170, _G_, and Fig. 454,\r\np. 417). At length the neck of land which separates meanders is so\r\nnarrow that in the next freshet a temporary jamming of logs within the\r\nchannel may direct the waters across the neck, and once started in\r\nthe new direction a channel is scoured out in the soft silt. Thus by\r\na breaking through of the bank of the stream, a so-called “crevasse”,\r\nthe river suddenly straightens its course, though up to this time it\r\nhas steadily become more and more sharply serpentine. After the cut-off\r\nhas occurred, the old channel may for a time continue to be used by the\r\nstream in common with the new one, but the advantage in velocity of\r\ncurrent being with the cut-off, the old channel contains slacker water\r\nand so begins to fill with silt both at the beginning and the end of\r\nthe loop. Eventually closed up at both ends, this loop or “ox-bow”\r\nis entirely separated from the new channel, and once abandoned of the\r\nstream is transformed into an ox-bow lake (Fig. 171 and p. 415).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 171.—An ox-bow lake in the flood plain of a river.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Meander scars.=—Swinging as it occasionally does in its meanderings\r\nquite across the flood plain and against the bank of the earlier\r\ndegrading river in this section, the meander at times scours the high\r\nbank which bounds the flood plain, and undermining it in the same\r\nmanner, it excavates a recess of amphitheatral form which is known as\r\na meander _scar_ (Fig. 172). At length the entire bank is scarred in\r\nthis manner so as to present to the stream a series of concave scallops\r\nseparated by sharp intermediate salients of cuspate form.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 172.—Schematic representation of a series of river terraces. _a_,\r\n_b_, _c_, _e_, successive terraces in order of age. _d_, _d_, _d_, _d_,\r\nterrace slopes formed of meander scars.]\r\n\r\n=River terraces.=—Whenever the river’s history is interrupted by a\r\nsmall uplift, or the base level is for any reason lowered, the stream\r\nat once begins to sink its channel into the flood plain. Once more\r\nflowing upon a low grade, it again meanders, and so produces new walls\r\nat a lower level, but formed, like the first, of intersecting meander\r\nscars. Thus there is produced a new flood plain with cliff and terrace\r\nabove, which is known as a _river terrace_. A succession of uplifts or\r\nof depressions of the base level yields terraces in series, as they\r\nappear schematically represented in Fig. 172. Such terraces are to be\r\nfound well developed upon most of our larger rivers to the northward of\r\nthe Ohio and Missouri. The highest terrace is obviously the remnant of\r\nthe earliest flood plain, as the lowest represents the latest.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The delta of the river.=—As it approaches its mouth the river moves\r\nmore and more sluggishly over the flat grades, and swings in broader\r\nmeanders as it flows. Yet it still carries a quantity of silt which is\r\nonly laid down after its current has been stopped on meeting the body\r\nof standing water into which it discharges. If this be the ocean, the\r\nsalinity of the sea water greatly aids in a quick precipitation of the\r\nfinest material. This clarifying effect upon the water of the dissolved\r\nsalt may be strikingly illustrated by taking two similar jars, the\r\none filled with fresh and the other with salt water, and stirring the\r\nsame quantity of fine clay into each. The clay in the salt water is\r\ndeposited and the water cleared long before the murkiness of the other\r\nhas disappeared.\r\n\r\nBy the laying down of the residue of its burden of sediment where it\r\nmeets the sea, the river builds up vast plains of silt and clay which\r\nare known as deltas and which often form large local extensions of the\r\ncontinents into the sea. Whereas in its upper reaches the river with\r\nits tributary streams appears in the plan like a tree and its branches,\r\nin the delta region the stream, by dividing into diverging channels\r\ncalled distributaries (Fig. 458, p. 420), completes the resemblance to\r\nthe tree by adding the roots. From the divergence of the distributaries\r\nupon the delta plain the Greek capital letter Δ is suggested and has\r\nsupplied the name for these deposits. Of great fertility, the delta\r\nplains of rivers have become the densely populated regions of the\r\nglobe, among which it is necessary to mention only the delta of the\r\nNile in Egypt, those of the Ganges and Brahmaputra in India, and those\r\nof the Hoang and Yangtse rivers in China.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The levee.=—When the snows thaw upon the mountains at the headwaters\r\nof large rivers, freshets result and the delta regions are flooded. At\r\nsuch times heavily charged with sediment, a thin deposit of fertile\r\nsoil is left upon the surface of the delta plain, and in Egypt\r\nparticularly this is depended upon for the annual enrichment of the\r\ncultivated fields. Though at this time the waters spread broadly over\r\nthe plain, the current still continues to flow largely within the\r\nnormal channel, so that the slack water upon either side becomes the\r\nlocus for the main deposit of the sediment. There is thus built up on\r\neither side of the channel a ridge of silt which is known as a _levee_,\r\nand this bank is steadily increased in height from year to year (Fig.\r\n452).\r\n\r\nTo prevent the danger of floods upon the inhabited plains, artificial\r\nlevees are usually raised upon the natural ones, and in a country like\r\nHolland, such levees (dikes) involve a large expenditure of money and\r\nno small degree of engineering skill and experience to construct. So\r\nimportant to the life of the nation is the proper management of its\r\ndikes, that in the past history of China each weak administration has\r\nbeen marked by the development of graft in this important department\r\nand by floods which have destroyed the lives of hundreds of thousands\r\nof people.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 173.—“Bird-foot” delta of the Mississippi River.]\r\n\r\nWherever there has been a markedly rapid sinking upon a delta region,\r\nand depressions are common in delta territory, no doubt as a result of\r\nthe loading down of the crust, the river may present the paradoxical\r\ncondition of flowing at a higher level than the surrounding country.\r\nBetween the levees of neighboring distributaries there are peculiar\r\nsaucer-shaped depressions of the country which easily become filled\r\nwith water. At the extremity of the delta the levee may be the only\r\nland which shows above the ocean surface, and so present the peculiar\r\n“bird-foot” outline which is characteristic of the extremity of the\r\nMississippi delta, though other processes than the mere sinking of the\r\ndeposits may contribute to this result (Fig. 173).\r\n\r\n\r\n=The sections of delta deposits.=—If now we leave the plan of the\r\ndelta to consider the section of its deposits, we find them so\r\ncharacteristic as to be easily recognized. Considered broadly, the\r\ndelta advances seaward after the manner of a railroad embankment\r\nwhich is being carried across a lake. Though the greater portion of\r\nthe deposit is unloaded upon a steep slope at the front, a smaller\r\namount of material is dropped along the way, and a layer of extremely\r\nfine material settles in advance as the water clears of its finely\r\nsuspended particles (Fig. 174). Simultaneous deposits within a delta\r\nthus comprise a nearly horizontal layer of coarser materials, the\r\nso-called top-set bed; the bulk of the deposit in a forward sloping\r\nlayer, the so-called fore-set bed; and a thin film of clay which is\r\nextended far in advance, the bottom-set bed (Fig. 174, 2). If at any\r\npoint a vertical section is made through the deposits, beds deposited\r\nin different periods are encountered; the oldest at the bottom in a\r\nhorizontal position, the next younger above them and with forward\r\ndip, and the youngest and coarsest upon the top in nearly horizontal\r\nposition (Fig. 174, 3).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 174.—Diagrams to show the nature of delta deposits as exhibited\r\nin section.]\r\n\r\nIt has been estimated that the surface of the United States is now\r\nbeing pared down by erosion at the average rate of an inch in 760\r\nyears. The derived material is being deposited in the flood plain\r\nand delta regions of its principal rivers. Some 513 million tons of\r\nsuspended matter is in the United States carried to tidewater each\r\nyear, and about half as much more goes out to sea as dissolved matter.\r\nIf this material were removed from the Panama Canal cutting, an 85-foot\r\nsea-level canal would be excavated in about 73 days. The Mississippi\r\nRiver alone carries annually to the sea 340 million tons of suspended\r\nmatter, or two thirds of the entire amount removed from the area of the\r\nUnited States as a whole. It is thus little wonder that great deltas\r\nhave extended their boundaries so rapidly and that the crust is so\r\ngenerally sinking beneath the load.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nEARTH FEATURES SHAPED BY RUNNING WATER\r\n\r\n\r\n=The newly incised upland and its sharp salients.=—The successive\r\nstages of incising, sculpturing, and finally of reducing an uplifted\r\nland area, are each of them possessed of distinctive characters\r\nwhich are all to be read either from the map or in the lines of the\r\nlandscape. Upon the newly uplifted plain the incising by the young\r\nrivers is to be found chiefly in the neighborhood of the margins. In\r\nthis stage the valleys are described as V-shaped cañons, for the valley\r\nwall meets the upland surface in sharp salients (plate 12 A), and the\r\nlines of the landscape are throughout made up from straight elements.\r\nThough the landscapes of this stage present the grandest scenery that\r\nis known and may be cut out in massive proportions, often with rushing\r\nriver or placid lake to enhance the effect of crag and gorge, they lack\r\nthe softness and grace of outline which belong only to the maturer\r\nerosion stages. The grand cañon of the Colorado presents the features\r\ncharacteristic of this stage in the grandest and most sublime of all\r\nexamples, and the castled Rhine is a gorge of rugged beauty, carved out\r\nfrom the newly elevated plateau of western Prussia, through which the\r\nwater swirls in eddying rapids (Fig. 175).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 175.—Gorge of the River Rhine near St. Goars, incised within an\r\nuplifted plain which forms the hill tops.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The stage of adolescence.=—As the upland becomes more largely\r\ninvaded as a consequence of the headward advance of the cañons and\r\ntheir sending out of tributary side cañons, the sharp angles in which\r\nthe cañon walls intersect the plain become gradually replaced by\r\nwell-rounded shoulders. Thus the lines in the landscape of this stage\r\nare a combination of the straight line with a simple curve convex\r\ntoward the sky (Fig. 176). In this stage large sections of the original\r\nplateau remain, though cut into small areas by the extensions of the\r\ntributary valleys.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 176.—V-shaped valley with well-rounded shoulders characteristic of\r\nthe stage of adolescence. Allegheny plateau in West Virginia.]\r\n\r\n=The maturely dissected upland.=—Continued ramifications by the\r\nrivers eventually divide the entire upland area into separated parts,\r\nand the rounding of the shoulders of valleys proceeds simultaneously\r\nuntil of the original upland no easily recognizable compartments\r\nare to be found. Where before were flat hilltops are now ridges or\r\nwatersheds, the well-known _divides_. The upland is now said to be\r\ncompletely dissected or to have arrived at _maturity_. The streams are\r\nstill vigorous, for they make the full descent from the upland level\r\nto base level, and yet a critical turning point of their history has\r\nbeen reached, and from now on they are to show a steady falling off in\r\nefficiency as sculpturing agents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 177.—View of a maturely dissected upland from one of its\r\nhilltops, Klamath Mountains, California (after a photograph by\r\nFairbanks).]\r\n\r\nViewed from one of the hilltops, the landscape of this stage bears a\r\nmarked resemblance to a sea in which the numberless divides are the\r\ncrests of billows, and these, as distance reduces their importance in\r\nthe landscape, fade away into the even line of the horizon (Fig. 177).\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Hogarthian line of beauty.=—Since the youthful stage of the\r\nupland, when the lines of its landscape were straight, its character\r\nrugged, and its rivers wild and turbulent, there has been effected\r\na complete transformation. The only straight line to be seen is the\r\ndistant horizon, for the landscape is now molded in softened outlines,\r\namong which there is a repeated recurrence of the line of beauty made\r\nfamous by Hogarth in his “Analysis of Beauty.” As well known to all art\r\nstudents, this is a sinuous line of reversed or double curvature—a\r\ncurve which passes insensibly at a point of inflection from convex\r\nto concave (Fig. 178). The curve of beauty is now found in every\r\nsection of the hills, and it imparts to the landscape a gracefulness\r\nand a measure of restfulness as well, which are not to be found in the\r\nlandscapes of earlier stages in the erosion cycle. In the bottoms of\r\nthe valleys also the initial windings of the rivers within their narrow\r\nflood plains add silver beauty lines which stand out prominently from\r\nthe more somber background of the hills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 178.—Hogarth’s line of beauty.]\r\n\r\nConsidered from the commercial viewpoint, the mature upland is one\r\nof the least adaptable as a habitation for highly civilized man.\r\nDirect lines of communication run up hill and down dale in monotonous\r\nalternation, and almost the only way of carrying a railroad through the\r\nregion, without an expenditure for trestles which would be prohibitive,\r\nis to follow the tortuous crest of a main divide or the equally winding\r\nbed of one of the larger valleys.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 179.—View of the old land of New England, with Mount Monadnock\r\nrising in the distance.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The final product of river sculpture—the peneplain.=—When maturity\r\nhas been reached in the history of a river, its energies are devoted\r\nto a paring down of the valley slopes and crests so as to reduce the\r\ngeneral level. From this time on hill summits no longer fall into a\r\ncommon level—that of the original upland—for some mount notably\r\nhigher than others, and with increasing age such differences become\r\naccentuated. There is now also a larger aggradation of the valleys to\r\nform the level floors of flood plains, out of which at length the now\r\nslight elevations rise upon such gentle slopes that the process of\r\nland sculpture approaches its end. Gradually the vigor of the stream\r\nhas faded away, and can now only be renewed through a fresh uplift of\r\nthe land, or, what would amount to the same thing, a depression of\r\nthe base level. Upland and river have reached old age together, and\r\nthe approximation to a new plain but little elevated above base level\r\nis so marked that the name _peneplain_ is applied to it. Scattered\r\nelevations, which because of some favoring circumstance rise to\r\ngreater heights above the general level of the peneplain, are known as\r\n_monadnocks_ after the type example of Mount Monadnock in New Hampshire\r\n(Fig. 179).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 180.—Comparison of the cross sections of river\r\nvalleys for the different stages of the erosion cycle.]\r\n\r\n=The river cross sections of successive stages.=—To the successive\r\nstages of a river’s life it has been common to carry over the names\r\nfrom the well-marked periods of a human life. If neglecting for the\r\nmoment the general aspect of the upland, we fix our attention upon the\r\ncharacteristic cross sections of the river valley, we find that here\r\nalso there are clearly marked characters to distinguish each stage\r\nof the river’s life (Fig. 180). In infancy the steep, narrow, and\r\nsharp-angled cañon is a characteristic; with youth the wider V-form\r\nhas already developed; in adolescence the angles of the cañon are\r\ntransformed into well-rounded shoulders, and the valley broadens so\r\nas in the lower reaches to lay down a flood plain; in maturity the\r\ndivides and the double curves of the line of beauty appear; while in\r\nthe decline of old age the valleys are extremely broad and flat and are\r\nfloored by an extended flood plain.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The entrenchment of meanders with renewed uplift.=—Upon the reduced\r\ngrades which are characteristic of the declining stage of a river’s\r\nlife, the current has little power to modify the surface configuration.\r\nOn the old land of this stage a renewed uplift starts the streams again\r\ninto action. This infusion of driving power into moving water, regarded\r\nas a machine capable of accomplishing certain work, is like winding up\r\na clock that has run down. Once more the streams acquire a velocity\r\nsufficient to enable them to cut their valleys into the land surface,\r\nand so a new erosional cycle may be inaugurated upon the old land\r\nsurface—the peneplain. After such an uplift has been accomplished\r\nand the rivers have sunk their early valleys within the new upland, we\r\nmay look out from this now elevated surface and the eye take in but a\r\nsingle horizontal line, since we view the plain along its edge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 181.—The Beavertail Bend of the Yakima Cañon in\r\ncentral Washington (after George Otis Smith).]\r\n\r\nBy the uplift the meanders of the earlier rivers may become entrenched\r\nin the new upland, the wide lobes of the individual meanders being now\r\nseparated by mountains where before had been plains of silt only. The\r\nNew River of the Cumberland plateau and the Yakima River of central\r\nWashington (Fig. 181) furnish excellent American examples of intrenched\r\nmeanders, as the Moselle River does in Europe. Upon the course of the\r\nlatter river near the town of Zell a tunnel of the railroad a quarter\r\nof a mile in length pierces a mountain in the neck of a meander lobe\r\nin which the river itself travels a distance of more than six miles in\r\norder to make the same advance. The Kaiser Wilhelm tunnel in the same\r\ndistrict penetrates a larger mountain included in a double meander of\r\nthe river. Although intrenched, river meanders are still competent to\r\nscour and so undermine the outer bank, and with favoring conditions\r\nthey may by this process erode extended “bottoms” out of the plateau.\r\n(See Lockport quadrangle, U. S. G. S.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=The valley of the rejuvenated river.=—Whenever a new uplift occurs\r\nbefore an erosional cycle has been completed, the rivers become\r\nintrenched, not in a peneplain, but in the bottoms of broad valleys.\r\nThe sweeping curves which characterize mature landscapes may thus be\r\nbrought into striking contrast with the straight lines of youthful\r\ncañons which with V-sections descend from their lowest levels (Fig.\r\n182). The full cross section of such a valley shows a central V whose\r\nsharp shoulders are extended outward and upward in the softened curves\r\nof later erosion stages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 182.—A rejuvenated river valley (after a\r\nphotograph by Fairbanks).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The arrest of stream erosion by the more resistant rocks.=—The\r\ncapacity of a river to erode and carry away the rock material that\r\nlies along its course is dependent not only upon the velocity of the\r\ncurrent, but also upon the hardness, the firmness of texture, and the\r\nsolubility of the material. Particularly in arid and semiarid regions,\r\nwhere no mantle of vegetation is at hand to mask the surfaces of the\r\nfirmer rock masses, differences of this kind are stamped deeply upon\r\nthe landscape. The rock terraces in the Grand Cañon of the Colorado\r\ntogether represent the stronger rock formations of the region, while\r\nsloping talus accumulations bury the weaker beds from sight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 183.—Plan of a river narrows.]\r\n\r\nEach area of harder rock which rises athwart the course of a stream\r\ncauses a temporary arrest in the process of valley erosion and is\r\nresponsible for a noteworthy local contraction of the river valley.\r\nThe valley is carved less widely as well as less deeply, and since a\r\nriver can never corrade below its base, a “temporary base level” is\r\nfor a time established above the area of harder rock. Owing to the\r\ncontraction of the valley under these conditions, the locality is\r\ndescribed as a river _narrows_ (Fig. 183). The narrows upon the Hudson\r\nRiver occur in the Highlands where the river leaves a broad expanse\r\noccupied by softer sediments to traverse an island-like area of hard\r\ncrystalline rocks. Within the narrows of a river the steep walls,\r\ncharacteristic of youth and the turbulent current as well, are often\r\nretained long after other portions of the river have acquired the more\r\nrestful lines of river maturity. The picturesque crag and the generally\r\nrugged character of river narrows render them points of special\r\ninterest upon every navigable river.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 184.—Successive diagrams to illustrate repeated river piracy and\r\nthe development of “trellis drainage”, (after Russell).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The capture of one river’s territory by another.=—The effect of a\r\nhard layer of rock interposed in the course of a stream is thus always\r\nto delay the advance of the erosional process at all levels above the\r\nobstruction. When a stream in incising its valley degrades its channel\r\nthrough a veneer of softer rocks into harder materials below, it is\r\ntechnically described as having _discovered_ the harder layer. Where\r\nseveral neighboring streams flow by similar routes to their common base\r\nlevel, those which discover a harder rock will advance their headwaters\r\nless rapidly into the upland and so will be at a disadvantage in\r\nextending their drainage territory. A stream which is not thus hindered\r\nwill in the course of time rob the others of a portion of their\r\nterritory, for it is able to erode its lower reaches nearer to base\r\nlevel and thus acquire for its upper reaches, where erosion is chiefly\r\naccomplished, an advantage in declivity. The divide which separates its\r\nheadwaters from those of its less favored neighbor will in consequence\r\nmigrate steadily into the neighbor’s territory. The divide is thus a\r\nsort of boundary wall separating the drainage basins of neighboring\r\nstreams, and any migration must extend the territory of the one at\r\nthe expense of the other. As more and more territory is brought under\r\nthe dominion of the more favored stream, there will come a time when\r\nthe divide in its migration will arrive at the channel of the stream\r\nthat is being robbed, and so by a sudden act of annexation draw off\r\nall the upper waters into its own basin. By this _capture_ the stream\r\nwhose territory has been invaded is said to have been _beheaded_.\r\nBy this act of _piracy_ the stronger stream now develops exceptional\r\nactivity because of the local steep grades near the point of capture,\r\nand with this newly acquired cutting power the invader is competent to\r\nadvance still further and enter the territory of the stream that lies\r\nnext beyond. The type of drainage network which results from repeated\r\ncaptures of this kind is known as “trellis drainage” (Fig. 184), a type\r\nwell illustrated by the rivers of the southern Appalachians.\r\n\r\nIn general it may be said that, other conditions being the same, of\r\ntwo neighboring streams which have a common base level, that one which\r\ntakes the longest route will lose territory to the other, since it must\r\nhave the flatter average slope. Stream capture may thus come about\r\nwithout the discovery of hard rock layers which are more unfavorable to\r\none stream than another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 185.—Sketch maps to show the earlier and the present drainage\r\ncondition about the Blue Ridge near Harper’s Ferry.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Water and wind gaps.=—In the Allegheny plateau rivers cross, the\r\nrange of harder rocks in deep mountain narrows which upon the horizon\r\nappear as gateways through the barrier of the mountain wall. Such\r\ngateways are sometimes referred to as “water gaps”, of which the\r\nDelaware Water Gap is perhaps the best known example, though the\r\nPotomac crosses the Blue Ridge at the historic Harper’s Ferry through\r\na similar portal. The valley of the tributary Shenandoah has been the\r\nscene of an interesting episode in the struggle of rival streams which\r\nis typical of others in the same upland region. The records which may\r\nbe made out from the landscapes show clearly that in an earlier but\r\nrecent period, when the general surface stood at a higher level which\r\nhas been called the Kittatinny Plain, the younger Potomac of that time\r\nand a younger but larger ancestor of Beaverdam Creek each crossed\r\nthe Blue Ridge of the time through similar water gaps (Fig. 185, map,\r\nand Fig. 186). The Potomac of that time was, however, the more deeply\r\nintrenched, and possessing an advantage in slope it was able to advance\r\nthe divide at the head of its tributary, the Shenandoah, into the\r\nterritory of Beaverdam Creek. Thus the beheading of the Beaverdam by\r\nthe Shenandoah was accomplished (Fig. 185, second map) and its upper\r\nwaters annexed to the Potomac system. With the subsequent lowering of\r\nthe general level of the country which yielded the present Shenandoah\r\nPlain, the former water gap of Beaverdam Creek was abandoned of its\r\nstream at a high level in the range. Known as Snickers Gap, it may\r\nserve as a type of the “wind gaps” of similar origin which are not\r\naltogether uncommon in the Appalachian Mountain system (Fig. 186).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 186.—Section to illustrate the history of Snickers\r\nGap.]\r\n\r\n=Character profiles.=—For humid regions the landscapes possess\r\ncharacters which, speaking broadly, depend upon the stage of the\r\nerosion cycle. For the earliest stages the straight line enters as\r\nalmost the only element in the design; as the cycle advances to\r\nadolescence the rounded forms begin to replace the angles of the\r\nimmature stages, and with full maturity the lines of beauty alone\r\nare characteristic. As this critical stage is passed irregularity of\r\nfeature and ever more flattened curves are found to correspond to the\r\ndecline of the river’s vital energies. There are thus marks of senility\r\nin the work of rivers (Fig. 187).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 187.—Character profiles of landscapes shaped by\r\nstream erosion in humid climates.]\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING REFERENCES FOR CHAPTERS XII AND XIII\r\n\r\n General:—\r\n\r\n SIR JOHN PLAYFAIR.

Here it descends by gravity through\r\nthe pores and open spaces, and at a quite moderate depth arrives at a\r\nzone which is completely saturated with water. The depth of the upper\r\nsurface of this saturated zone varies with the humidity of the climate,\r\nwith the altitude of the earth’s surface, and with many other similarly\r\nvarying factors. Within humid regions its depth may vary from a few\r\nfeet to a few hundred feet, while in desert areas the surface may lie\r\nas low as a thousand feet or more.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the zone of the lithosphere that is saturated with water\r\nis called the _water table_, and though less accentuated it conforms in\r\ngeneral to the relief of the country (Fig. 188). Its depth at any point\r\nis found from the levels of all perennial streams and from the levels\r\nat which water stands in wells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 188.—Diagram to show the seasonal range in the\r\nposition of the water table and the cause of intermittent streams.]\r\n\r\nDuring the season of small precipitation the water table is lowered,\r\nand if at such times it falls below the bed of a valley, the surface\r\nstream within the valley dries up, to be revived when, after heavier\r\nprecipitation, the water table has in turn been raised. Such streams\r\nare said to be _intermittent_, and are especially characteristic of\r\nsemiarid regions (Fig. 188).\r\n\r\nWherever in descending from the surface an impervious layer, such as\r\nclay, is encountered, the further downward progress of the water is\r\narrested. Now conducted in a lateral direction it issues at the surface\r\nas a spring at the line of emergence of the upper surface of the\r\nimpervious layer (Fig. 189).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 189.—Diagram to show how an impervious layer\r\nconducts the descending water in a lateral direction to issue in\r\nsurface springs.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The trunk channels of descending water.=—While within the\r\nunconsolidated rock materials near the surface of the earth, it is\r\nclear that water can circulate in proportion as the materials are\r\nporous and so relatively pervious. As the pore spaces become minute and\r\ncapillary, the difficulty of permeation through the materials becomes\r\nvery great. Thus in the noncoherent rocks it is the coarse gravel and\r\nthe layers of sand which serve as the underground channels, while the\r\nfine clays have the effect of an impervious wall upon the circulating\r\nwaters. In coarse sand as much as a third of the volume of the material\r\nis pore space for the absorption and transmission of water. Even under\r\nthese favorable conditions the movement of the water is exceedingly\r\nslow and usually less than a fifth of a mile a year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 190.—Sketch map of the Oucane de Chabrières near Chorges in the\r\nHigh Alps, to illustrate the corrosion of limestone along two series of\r\nvertical joints (after Martel).]\r\n\r\nWithin the hard rocks it is the sandstones which have the largest pore\r\nspaces, but in nearly all consolidated rocks there are additional\r\nspaces along certain of the bedding planes, the joint openings (Fig.\r\n190), and the crushed zones of displacement, so that these parting\r\nplanes become the trunk channels, so to speak, of the circulating\r\nwater. It is along such crevices that in the course of time the\r\nmineral matter carried in solution by the water is deposited to produce\r\nthe ore veins and the associated crystallized minerals.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The caverns of limestones.=—Where limestone formations have a nearly\r\nflat upper surface, a large part of the surface water enters the rock\r\nby way of the joint spaces, which it soon widens by solution into\r\nbroad crevices with well-rounded shoulders. At joint intersections\r\nsolution of the limestone is so favored that the water may here descend\r\nin a sort of vertical shaft until it meets a bedding plane extending\r\nlaterally and offering more favorable conditions for corrosion. Its\r\njourney now begins in a lateral direction, and solution of the rock\r\ncontinuing, a tunnel may be etched out and extended until another\r\njoint is encountered which is favorable to its further descent into\r\nthe formation. By this process on alternating shafts and galleries\r\nthe water descends to near the surface of the water table by a series\r\nof steps, and is eventually discharged into the river system of the\r\ndistrict (Fig. 191). Within the larger caverns the water at the lowest\r\nlevel usually flows as a subterranean river to emerge later into the\r\nlight from beneath a rock arch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 191.—Diagram to show the relation of caverns in limestone to\r\nthe river system of the district and to the “swallow holes” upon the\r\nsurface.]\r\n\r\nFrom the plan of a system of connecting caverns it may often be\r\nobserved that the galleries of the several levels are alike directed\r\nalong two rectangular directions which indicate the master joint\r\ndirections within the limestone formation. This is especially clear\r\nfrom the map of the galleries in the explored portions of the Mammoth\r\nCave (Fig. 192).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Swallow holes and limestone sinks.=—Above the caverns of limestone\r\nformations there are selected points where the water has descended\r\nin the largest volume, and here funnel-shaped depressions have\r\nbeen dissolved out from the surface of the rock. In different\r\ndistricts such depressions have become known as “sinks”, “swallow\r\nholes”, _entonnoirs_, and _Orgeln_. Wherever the depressions have\r\na characteristic circular outline, there can be little doubt that\r\nthey are the product of solution by the descending water, and have\r\nrelatively small connections only with the subterranean caverns. They\r\nhave thus naturally collected upon their bottoms the insoluble clay\r\nwhich was contained in the impure limestone as well as a certain amount\r\nof slope wash from the surface. Inasmuch as the clays are impervious\r\nto water, the bottoms of these swallow holes are better supplied with\r\nmoisture than the surrounding rock surfaces, and by nourishing a more\r\nvigorous plant growth are strongly impressed upon the landscape (Fig.\r\n193).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 192.—Plan of a portion of Mammoth Cave, Kentucky\r\n(after H. C. Hovey).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 193.—Trees and shrubs growing luxuriantly upon the bottoms of\r\nsinks within a limestone country (after a photograph by H. T. A. de L.\r\nHus).]\r\n\r\nCertain of the depressions above caverns are, however, less regular in\r\noutline, and their bottoms are occupied by a mass of limestone rubble.\r\nIn some instances, at least, these depressions appear to be the result\r\nof local incaving of the cavern roofs. An incaving of this nature may\r\nclose up an earlier gallery in the cavern and divert the cave waters\r\nto a new course. The destruction of the roofs of caverns through this\r\nprocess of incaving may continue until only relatively small remnants\r\nare left. From long subterranean tunnels the caves are thus transformed\r\ninto subaërial rock bridges that have become known as “natural\r\nbridges.” The best-known American example is the Natural Bridge near\r\nLexington, Virginia. Much grander natural bridges have been formed in\r\nsandstone by a totally different process, and must not be confused with\r\nthese limestone remnants of caverns.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The sinter deposits.=—Just as water can dissolve the calcareous\r\nrocks with the formation of caverns, it can under other conditions\r\ndeposit the material which has thus been taken into solution. Its\r\npower to hold carbonate of lime in solution is dependent upon the\r\npresence of carbonic acid gas within the water. Water charged with gas\r\nand dissolved lime carbonate is said to be “hard”, and if the gas be\r\ndriven off by boiling or otherwise, the dissolved lime is thrown out of\r\nsolution and deposited in a form well known to all housekeepers.\r\n\r\nHard water flowing in a surface stream, if dashed into spray at a\r\ncascade, may deposit its lime carbonate in an ever thickening veneer\r\nwherever the spray is dashed about the falls. This material, when cut\r\nin section, has waving parallel layers and is known as _travertine_\r\nor _calcareous sinter_. Some of the most remarkable deposits of this\r\nnature may be seen at the cascade of Tivoli near Rome, and most of the\r\nRoman buildings have been constructed from travertine that has been\r\nquarried in the vicinity.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The growth of stalactites.=—Water, after percolating slowly through\r\nthe crevices of limestone, where it becomes charged with the carbonic\r\nacid gas and with dissolved carbonate of lime, may trickle from the\r\nroof of a cavern. Emerging from the narrow crevice, it may give off\r\nsome of its contained gas and is usually subject to evaporation,\r\nwith the result that the lime carbonate is left adhering to the rock\r\nsurface from which evaporation took place. If the water collects upon\r\nthe cavern roof so slowly that it can entirely evaporate before a drop\r\ncan form, the entire content of carbonate will be left adhering to the\r\nroof. Evaporation is most rapid near the margins and over the center of\r\neach drop as it develops, and the deposit which is left thus takes the\r\nform of tiny white rings at those points upon the crevice where there\r\nis the easiest passage for the trickling water. To the outer surface\r\nof these rings water will first adhere and then evaporate, as it will\r\nalso slowly ooze through the passage in the ring, but here without\r\nevaporation until it reaches the lower surface. A pendant structure\r\nwill, therefore, develop, growing outward in all directions by the\r\ndeposition of concentric layers which are thickest near the roof, and\r\ndownward into the form of a rock “icicle” through evaporation of the\r\nwater which collects near the tip. These pendant sinter formations are\r\nknown as stalactites and are thus formed of concentric layers arranged\r\nlike a series of nested cornucopias with a perforation of nearly\r\nuniform caliber along the axis of the structure (Fig. 194).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 194.—Diagrams to show the manner of formation of stalactites,\r\nstalagmites, and sinter columns beneath parallel crevices upon the\r\nroofs of caverns (in part after von Knebel).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Formation of stalagmites.=—Wherever the water percolates through\r\nthe roof of the cavern so rapidly that it cannot entirely evaporate\r\nupon the roof, a portion falls to the floor, and, spattering as it\r\nstrikes, builds up a relatively thick cone of sinter known as a\r\nstalagmite, and this is accurately centered beneath a stalactite\r\nupon the roof. In proportion as the cavern is high, the dropping\r\nwater is widely dispersed as it strikes the floor, with the formation\r\nof a correspondingly thick and blunt stalagmite. As this rises by\r\ngrowth toward the roof, it often develops upon its summit a distinct\r\ncrater-like depression (Fig. 194, lower figure). When the process is\r\nlong continued, stalactites and stalagmites may grow together to form\r\ncolumns which may be ranged with their neighbors like the pipes of an\r\norgan, and like them they give out clear tones when struck lightly with\r\na mallet. At other times the columns are joined to their neighbors to\r\nform hangings and draperies of the most fantastic and beautiful design\r\n(Fig. 195).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 195.—Sinter formations in the Luray caverns,\r\nVirginia.]\r\n\r\nIn remote antiquity limestone caverns afforded a refuge to many species\r\nof predatory birds and animals as well as to our earliest ancestors.\r\nThe bones of all these denizens of the caves lie entombed within the\r\nclays and the sinter formations upon the cavern floors, and they tell\r\nthe story of a fierce and long-continued warfare for the possession of\r\nthese natural strongholds. The evidence is clear that these cave men\r\nwith their primitive weapons were able at times to drive away the cave\r\nbears, lions, and hyenas, and to set up in the cavern their simple\r\nhearths, only in their turn to be conquered by the ferocity of their\r\nenemies. Some of the European caves have yielded many wagonloads of the\r\nskeletons of these fierce predatory animals, together with the simple\r\nweapons of the primitive man.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Karst and its features.=—Most so-called limestones have a large\r\nadmixture of argillaceous materials (clays) and of siliceous or sandy\r\nparticles. Such impurities make up the bulk of the clays and muds which\r\nare left behind when the soluble portions of the limestone have been\r\ndissolved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 196.—Map of the dolines of the Karst region near\r\nDivača.]\r\n\r\nSwallow holes we have found to be characteristic features within such\r\ndistricts. When limestones are more nearly pure, as in the Karst\r\nregion east of the Adriatic Sea, similar features are developed, but\r\nupon a grander scale, and certain additional forms are encountered. In\r\nplace of the sink or swallow hole, there appears the “karst funnel” or\r\n_doline_, a deep, bowl-shaped depression having a flat bottom. Such\r\nfunnels may be 30 to 3000 feet across and from 6 to 300 feet in depth\r\n(Fig. 196). Though in one or two instances known to be the result of\r\nthe break down of cavern roofs (Fig. 197), yet like the swallow holes\r\nof other regions these larger funnels appear generally to be the work\r\nof solution by the descending waters. Where they have been opened in\r\nartificial cuttings along railroads or in mines, the original rock is\r\nfound intact at the bottom, with small crevices only going down to\r\nlower levels. Over the bottoms of the dolines there is spread a layer\r\nof fertile red clay, the _terra rossa_, like that which is obtained\r\nas a residue when a fragment of the limestone has been dissolved in\r\nlaboratory experiments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 197.—Cross section of the doline formed by inbreak of a cavern\r\nroof. The Stara Apnenka doline in Carinthia (after Martel).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=A desert from the destruction of forests.=—Between the dolines is\r\nfound a veritable desert with jutting limestone angles and little if\r\nany vegetation. The water which falls upon the surface either runs off\r\nquickly or goes down to the subterranean caverns by which so much of\r\nthe country is undermined. Hence it is that the gardens which furnish\r\nthe sustenance for the scattered population are all included within\r\nthe narrow limits of the doline bottoms. Although to-day so largely a\r\nbarren waste, we know that the Karst upon the Adriatic was in remote\r\nantiquity a heavily forested region and that it supplied the myriads of\r\nwooden piles upon which the city of Venice is supported. The vessels\r\nwhich brought to this port upon the Adriatic its ancient prosperity\r\nwere built from wood brought from this tract of modern desert. In the\r\ndays of Venetian grandeur the fertile terra rossa formed a veneer upon\r\nthe rock surface of the Karst and so retained the surface waters for\r\nthe support of the luxuriant forest cover. After deforestation this\r\nveneer of rich soil was washed by the rains into the dolines or into\r\nthe few stream courses of the region, thus leaving a barren tract which\r\nit will be all but impossible to reclaim (plate 6 A).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 198.—Sharp _Karren_ of the Ifenplatte Allgäu\r\n(after Eckert).]\r\n\r\nUpon the steeper slopes over the purer limestones, the rain water runs\r\naway, guided by the joints within the rock. There is thus etched out a\r\nmore or less complete network of narrow channels (Fig. 190, p. 181),\r\nbetween which the remnants rise in sharp blades to produce a structure\r\noften simulated upon the fissured surface of a glacier that has been\r\nmelted in the sun’s rays (Fig. 401). These almost impassable areas of\r\nkarst country are described as _Schratten_ or _Karrenfelder_ (Fig. 198).\r\n\r\n\r\n=The ponore and the polje.=—To-day large areas of the Karst are\r\ndevoid of surface streams, nearly all the surface water finding its\r\nway down the crevices of the limestone into caverns, and there flowing\r\nin subterranean courses. The foot traveler in the Karst country is\r\nsometimes suddenly arrested to find a precipice yawning at his feet,\r\nand looking down a well-like opening to the depth of a hundred feet or\r\nmore, he may see at the bottom a large river which emerges from beneath\r\nthe one wall to disappear beneath the other. These well-like shafts are\r\nin the Austrian Karst known as _Ponores_, while to the southward in\r\nGreece they are called _Katavothren_.\r\n\r\n┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n│  PLATE 6.                                                            │\r\n│                                                                      │\r\n│ [Illustration: _A._ Barren Karst landscape near the famous Adelsberg │\r\n│ grottoes.                                                            │\r\n│ (_Photograph by I.

Such depressions of the\r\nkarst are known as _poljen_, and appear in most cases to be above the\r\ndownthrown blocks in the intricate fault mosaic of the region. Some of\r\nthese steeply walled inclosures have an area of several hundred square\r\nmiles, and especially at the time of the spring snow melting they are\r\nflooded with water and so transformed into seasonal lakes (Fig. 199\r\nand p. 422). It appears that at such times the cave galleries of the\r\nregion with their local narrows are not able to carry off all the water\r\nwhich is conducted to them; and in consequence there is a temporary\r\nimpounding of the flood waters in those portions of the river’s course\r\nwhich are open to the sky and more extended. The rush of water at\r\nsuch times may bring the red clay into the subterranean channels in\r\nsufficient quantity to clog the passages. The Zirknitz Lake usually has\r\nhigh water two or three times a year, and exceptionally the flooding\r\nhas continued for a number of years. It has thus in some districts been\r\nnecessary to afford relief to the population through the construction\r\nof expensive drainage tunnels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 199.—The Zirknitz seasonal lake within a polje of the Karst\r\n(after Berghaus).]\r\n\r\nThe conditions which are typified in the Karst area to the east of the\r\nAdriatic Sea are encountered also in many other lands; as, for example,\r\nin the Vorarlberg and Swiss Alps, in Lebanon, and in Sicily.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The return of the water to the surface.=—Water which has descended\r\nfrom the surface and been there held between impervious layers, may be\r\nunder the pressure of its own weight or “head”; and will later find its\r\nway upward, it may be to the surface or higher, where a perforation is\r\ndiscovered in its otherwise impervious cover. Such local perforations\r\nare produced naturally by lines of fracture or faulting (widened at\r\ntheir intersections), and artificially through the sinking of deep\r\nwells. The water, which at ordinary times reaches the surface upon\r\nfissures, is usually concentrated locally at the intersections of the\r\nfracture network, where it issues in lines of fissure springs (Fig.\r\n200); but at the time of earthquakes the water may rise above the\r\nsurface in lines of fountains (p. 83), or occasionally as sheets of\r\nwater which may mount some tens of feet into the air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 200.—Fissure springs arranged upon lines of rock fracture at\r\nintersections, Pomperaug valley, Connecticut.]\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the flow of surface springs, which varies with the\r\nseason through wide ranges both in its volume and in temperature of\r\nthe water, the volume of fissure springs is but slightly affected by\r\nthe seasonal precipitation, and the water temperature is maintained\r\nrelatively constant. Rock is but a poor heat conductor, and the\r\nseasonal temperature changes descend a few feet only into the ground.\r\nThus water which rises from depths of a few hundred feet only is\r\napt to be icy cold, while from greater depths the effect of the\r\nearth’s internal heat is apparent in a uniform but relatively higher\r\ntemperature of the water. Such “warm” or _thermal_ springs are apt to\r\ncontain considerable mineral matter in solution, both because the water\r\nis far traveled and because its higher temperature has considerably\r\nincreased its solvent properties.\r\n\r\nIt has long been recognized that lines of junction of different rock\r\nformations at the base of mountain ranges are localities favorable for\r\nthe occurrence of thermal springs. These junction lines are usually\r\nwithin zones where by movement upon fractures the widest openings\r\nin the rock have formed, and the catchment area of the neighboring\r\nmountain highland has supplied head for the ground water. A map of the\r\nhot springs within the Great Basin of the western United States would\r\npresent in the main a map of its principal faults.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Artesian wells.=—From the natural fissure spring an artesian\r\nwell differs in the artificial character of the perforation of the\r\nimpervious cover to the water layer. The water of artesian wells may\r\nflow out at the surface under pressure, or it may require pumping to\r\nraise it from some lower level. Ideal conditions are furnished where\r\nthe geological structure of the district is that of a broad basin\r\nor syncline. The water which falls in a neighboring upland is here\r\nimpounded between two parallel, saucer-like walls and will flow under\r\nits head if the upper wall be perforated at some low level (Fig. 201,\r\n3).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 201.—Schematic diagrams to illustrate the different types of\r\nartesian wells, (1) A non-flowing well; (2) flowing wells without basin\r\nstructure caused by clogging of the pervious formation; (3) flowing\r\nwells in an artesian basin. The dotted lines are the water levels\r\nwithin the pervious layers (after Chamberlin).]\r\n\r\nA monoclinal structure may furnish artesian conditions when the\r\ngenerally pervious layer has become clogged at a low level so as\r\nto hold back the water (Fig. 248, 2). Pumping wells may be used\r\nsuccessfully even when such clogging does not exist, for the\r\nslow-moving underground water flows readily in the direction of all\r\nfree outlets (Fig. 201, 1).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hot springs and geysers.=—Thermal springs whose temperature\r\napproaches the boiling point of water are known as _hot springs_.\r\nA _geyser_ is a hot spring which intermittently ejects a column of\r\nwater and steam. Both hot springs and geysers are to be found only in\r\nvolcanic regions, and appear to be connected with uncooled masses of\r\nsiliceous lava. In two of the three known geyser regions, Iceland and\r\nNew Zealand, the volcanoes of the neighborhood are still active, and\r\nthe lavas of the Yellowstone National Park date from the quite recent\r\ngeological period which immediately preceded the so-called “Ice Age.”\r\n\r\nWherever found, geysers are in the low levels along lines of drainage\r\nwhere the underground water would most naturally reappear at the\r\nsurface. Their water has penetrated to considerable depths below the\r\nsurface, but has been chiefly heated by ascending steam or other\r\nvapors. The water journey has been chiefly made along fissures, as is\r\nshown by the cool springs which often issue near them. Though some hot\r\nsprings and geysers may disappear from a district, others are found\r\nto be forming, and there is no good reason to think that geysers are\r\nrapidly dying out, as was at one time supposed.\r\n\r\nThe action of a geyser was first satisfactorily explained by the great\r\nGerman chemist Bunsen after he had made studies of the Icelandic\r\ngeysers, and the mechanics of the eruption was later strikingly\r\nillustrated in the laboratory by an artificial geyser constructed by\r\nthe Irish physicist Tyndall. In many respects this action is like that\r\nof the Strombolian eruption within a cinder cone, since it is connected\r\nwith the viscosity of the fluid and the resistance which this opposes\r\nto the liberation of the developing vapor. In the case of the geyser, a\r\ncolumn of heated water stands within a vertical tube and is heated near\r\nthe bottom of the column.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 202.—Cross section of Geysir, Iceland, with simultaneously\r\nobserved temperatures recorded at the left, and the boiling\r\ntemperatures for the same levels at the right (after Campbell).]\r\n\r\nThough the water may at its surface have the normal boiling temperature\r\nand be there in quiet ebullition, the boiling point for all lower\r\nlevels is raised by the weight of the column of superincumbent liquid,\r\nand so for a time the formation of steam within the mass is prevented.\r\nIn Fig. 202 is shown a cross section of the Icelandic _Geysir_ from\r\nwhich our name for such phenomena has been derived, and to this section\r\nhave been added the actual observed temperatures of the water at the\r\ndifferent levels as well as the temperatures at which boiling can take\r\nplace at these levels. From this it will be seen that at a depth of 45\r\nfeet the water is but 2° Centigrade below its boiling point. A slight\r\nincrease of temperature at this level, due to the constantly ascending\r\nsteam, will not only carry this layer above the boiling point, but the\r\nexpansion of the steam within the mass will elevate the upper layers of\r\nthe water into zones where the boiling points are lower, and thus bring\r\nabout a sudden and violent ebullition of all these upper portions. Thus\r\nis explained the almost universal observation that just before geysers\r\nerupt the hot water rises in the bowls and generally overflows them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 203.—Apparatus for simulating geyser action in the lecture room\r\n(by courtesy of Professor B. W. Snow).]\r\n\r\nThe water ejected from the geyser is considerably cooled in the air;\r\nand after its return to the tube must be again heated by the ascending\r\nvapors before another eruption can occur. The measure of the cooling,\r\nthe time necessary to fill the tube, and the supply of rising steam,\r\nall play a part in fixing the period which separates consecutive\r\neruptions. If the top of the tube be narrowed from its average\r\ncaliber, as is commonly observed to be true of the geysers within the\r\nYellowstone National Park, the escape of the steam is further hindered,\r\nand frequent geyser eruption promoted.\r\n\r\nAn artificial geyser for demonstration of the phenomenon in the lecture\r\nroom is represented in Fig. 203. The cut has been prepared from a\r\nphotograph of an apparatus designed by Professor B. W. Snow of the\r\nUniversity of Wisconsin. In this design the tube is contracted so as\r\nto have a top diameter one fourth only of what it is at the bottom,\r\nwhere heat is directly applied by multiple Bunsen lamps. The water once\r\nsufficiently heated, this artificial geyser erupts at regular intervals\r\nof time which are dependent upon the dimensions of the apparatus and\r\nthe quantity of heat applied.\r\n\r\nIn case of natural geysers a considerable quantity of heat escapes\r\nbetween eruptions in steam which issues quietly from the bowl of the\r\ngeyser. If this heat be retained by plugging the mouth of the tube with\r\na barrowful of turf, as is sometimes done with the geyser _Strokr_\r\nin Iceland, eruption is promoted and so takes place earlier. Another\r\nmethod of securing the same result is to increase the viscosity of the\r\nwater through the addition of soap, as was accidentally discovered by\r\na Chinaman who was utilizing the geyser water in the Yellowstone Park\r\nfor laundry operations. After this discovery it became a common custom\r\nto “soap” the Yellowstone geysers in order to make them play; but this\r\nmethod was prohibited under heavy penalty after the disastrous eruption\r\nof the Excelsior Geyser.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The deposition of siliceous sinter by plant growth.=—Geysers are\r\nknown only from areas of siliceous volcanic lava, and this may perhaps\r\nhave its cause in the easier solution of the geyser tube from such\r\nmaterials. The silica dissolved in the heated waters is _again_\r\ndeposited at the surface to form _siliceous sinter_ or _geyserite_.\r\nThis material forms terraces surrounding the geysers or is built up\r\ninto mounds which are often quite symmetrical, such as those of the Bee\r\nHive and Lone Star geysers of the Yellowstone Park (Fig. 204).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 204.—Cone of siliceous sinter built up about the mouth of the\r\nLone Star Geyser in the Yellowstone National Park.]\r\n\r\nThe greater part of this separation of silica from the heated geyser\r\nwaters is due to the action of plants or algæ that are able to\r\ngrow in the boiling waters and which produce the beautiful colors\r\nin the linings to the hot springs. The wonderful variety of the\r\ntints displayed is accounted for by the fact that the algæ take on\r\ndifferent colors at different temperatures. The silica is deposited\r\nfrom the water in the gelatinous hydrated form, which, however, dries\r\nin the sun to a white sand. The growth within the pools goes on in\r\na manner similar to that of a coral reef, the algæ dying below and\r\nthere becoming encased in the rock lining while still continuing to\r\ngrow upon the surface. Whereas sinter of this nature, when deposited\r\nby evaporation alone, can produce a maximum thickness of layer of a\r\ntwentieth of an inch each year, the growth from alga deposition within\r\nlimited areas may be as much as eight inches during the same period.\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING REFERENCES FOR CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n General:—\r\n\r\n F.

Those changes which, because often observed, are most\r\nfamiliar, may not be of general application, for the reason that the\r\nareas habitually occupied by highly civilized races together comprise\r\nbut a small portion of the earth’s surface. In the dank tropical\r\njungle, upon the vast arid sand plains, and in the cold white spaces\r\nnear the poles, Nature has instituted peculiar and widely different\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental condition of the desert is aridity, and this\r\nnecessitates an exclusion from it of all save the exceptional rain\r\ncloud. Thus deserts are walled in by mountain ranges which serve\r\nas barriers to intercept the moisture-bringing clouds. They are in\r\nconsequence saucer-shaped depressions, often with short mountain ranges\r\nrising out of the bottoms, and such rain as falls within the inclosure\r\nis largely upon the borders. Of this rainfall none flows out from the\r\ndesert, for the water is largely returned to the atmosphere through\r\nevaporation.\r\n\r\nThe desert history is thus begun in isolation from the sea from which\r\nthe cloud moisture is derived, a balance being struck between inflow\r\nand evaporation. Yet if deserts have no outlets, it is not true that\r\nthey have no rivers. These are occasionally permanent, often periodic,\r\nbut generally ephemeral and violent. The characteristic drainage of\r\ndeserts comes as the immediate result of sudden cloudburst. As a\r\nconsequence, the desert stream flows from the mountain wall choked\r\nwith sediment, and entering the depressed basin, is for the most part\r\neither sucked down into the floor or evaporated and returned to the\r\natmosphere. The dissolved material which was carried in the water is\r\neventually left in saline deposits, and the great burden of sediment\r\naccumulates in thick stratified masses which in magnitude outstrip the\r\nlargest deltas in the ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The self-registering gauge of past climates.=—From the initiation\r\nof the desert in its isolation from the lands tributary to the sea,\r\nits history becomes an individual and independent one. An increasing\r\nquantity of rainfall will be marked by larger inflow to the basin, and\r\nthe lakes which form in its lowest depression will, as a consequence,\r\nrise and expand over larger areas. A contrary climatic change will\r\nbring about a lowering of the lakes and leave behind the marks of\r\nformer shorelines above the water level (Fig. 205). Deserts are thus\r\nin a sense self-registering climatic gauges whose records go back far\r\nbeyond the historic past. From them it is learned that there have been\r\nalternating periods of larger and smaller precipitation, which are\r\nreferred to as _pluvial_ and _interpluvial_ periods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 205.—Former shore lines on the mountain wall\r\nsurrounding the desert of the Great Basin. View from the temple in Salt\r\nLake City (after Gilbert).]\r\n\r\nFrom such records it is learned that the Great Basin of the western\r\nUnited States was at one time occupied by two great desert lakes, the\r\none in the eastern portion being known as Lake Bonneville (Fig. 206).\r\nWith the desiccation which followed upon the series of pluvial periods,\r\nwhich in other latitudes resulted in great continental glaciers and\r\nhas become known as the Glacial Period, this former desert lake dried\r\nup to the limits of Great Salt Lake and a few smaller isolated basins.\r\nBetween 1850 and 1869 the waters of Great Salt Lake were rising, while\r\nfrom 1876 to 1890 their level was falling, though subject to periodic\r\nfluctuations, and in recent years the waters of the lake have risen so\r\nhigh as to pass all records since the occupation of the country. As\r\na consequence the so-called Salt Lake “cut-off” of the Union Pacific\r\nRailway, constructed at great expense across a shallow portion of the\r\nlake, has been overflowed by its waters. The Sawa Lake in the Persian\r\nDesert, which disappeared some five hundred years ago, again came into\r\nexistence in 1888 so as to cover the caravan route to Teheran.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 206.—Map of the former Lake Bonneville (dotted shores), and the\r\nboundaries of the Great Salt Lake of 1869 (smaller area) and that of\r\nthe present (after Berghaus).]\r\n\r\nThe record in the rocks of the distant past reveals the fact that in\r\nsome former deserts barriers were, in the course of time, broken down,\r\nwith the result that an invading sea entered through the breached\r\nwall. The result was the sudden destruction of land life, the remains\r\nof which are preserved in “bone beds”, now covered by true marine\r\ndeposits. A still later episode of the history was begun when the sea\r\nhad disappeared and land animals again roamed above the earlier desert.\r\nSuch an alternation of marine deposits with the remains of land plants\r\nand animals in the deposits of the Paris Basin, led the great Cuvier\r\nto his belief that geologic history was comprised of a succession of\r\ncataclysms in which life was alternately destroyed and re-created in\r\nnew forms—a view which later, under the powerful influence of Lyell\r\nand Darwin, gave way to that of more gradual changes and the evolution\r\nof life forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Some characteristics of the desert wastes.=—The great stretches of\r\nthe arid lands have been often compared to the ocean, and the Bedouin’s\r\ncamel is known as “the ship of the desert.” Though a deceptive\r\nresemblance for the most part, the comparison is not without its value.\r\nBoth are closed basins, and it is in this respect that the desert and\r\nthe ocean may be said to most resemble each other, for none of the\r\nwater and none of the sediment is lost to either except as boundaries\r\nare, with the progress of time, transposed or destroyed. Flatness of\r\nsurface and monotony of scenery both have in common, and the waters and\r\nthe sand are in each case salt; yet the ocean, from the tropics to the\r\npoles, has the same salts in essentially the same proportions, while in\r\nthe desert the widest variations are found both in the salts which are\r\npresent and in their relative quantities.\r\n\r\nUpon the borders of the ocean are found ridges of yellow sand heaped up\r\nby the wind, but these ramparts are small in comparison to those which\r\nin deserts are found upon the borders (plate 7 A).\r\n\r\nThe desert is a land of geographic paradoxes. As Walther has pointed\r\nout, we have rain in the desert which does not wet, springs which yield\r\nno brooks, rivers without mouths, forests preserved in stone, lakes\r\nwithout outlets, valleys without streams, lake basins without lakes,\r\ndepressions below the level of the sea yet barren of water, intense\r\nweathering with no mantle of disintegrated rock, a decomposition of the\r\nrocks from within instead of from without, and valleys which branch\r\nsometimes upstream and sometimes down.\r\n\r\nWithin the deserts curious mushroom-like remnants of erosion afford a\r\nlocal relief from the searching rays of the desert sun. Pocket-like\r\nopenings large enough for a hermit’s habitation are hollowed out by the\r\nwind from the disintegrated rock masses. Amphitheaters open out from\r\nlittle erosion valleys or wadi, and isolated outliers of the mountains\r\nstand like sentinels before their massive fronts.\r\n\r\nBecause of the general absence of clouds above a desert, no shield\r\nsuch as is common in humid regions is provided against the blinding\r\nintensity of the sun’s rays. Sun temperatures as high as 180°\r\nFahrenheit have been registered over the deserts of western Africa.\r\nEvery one is familiar with the fact that a blanket of thick clouds is a\r\nprevention of frosts at night, for, with the setting of the sun and the\r\nconsequent radiation of heat from the earth, these rays are intercepted\r\nby the clouds, returned and re-returned in many successive exchanges.\r\nOver desert regions the absence of any such blanket of moisture is\r\nresponsible for the remarkable falls of temperature at sunset. Though\r\nshortly before temperatures of 100° Fahrenheit or greater may have been\r\nmeasured, it is not uncommon for water to freeze during the following\r\nnight. Much the same conditions of sudden temperature change with\r\nnightfall are experienced in high mountains when one has ascended above\r\nthe blanketing clouds.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 207.—Borax deposits upon the floor of Death valley, California\r\n(after a photograph by Fairbanks).]\r\n\r\n=Dry weathering—the red and brown desert varnish.=—In desert lands\r\nthe fierce rays of the sun suck up all the available moisture, and\r\nthe water table may be hundreds of feet below the surface. Roots of\r\ntrees a hundred feet or more in length have been found to testify to\r\nthe fierce struggle of the desert plant with the arid conditions. In\r\nhumid regions the meteoric water dissolves the more soluble sodium\r\nsalts near the surface of the rock and carries them out to the ocean,\r\nwhere they add to the saltness of the sea. In the desert the rare\r\nprecipitations prevent an outflow, but the sun’s strong rays suck out\r\nwith the moisture the salts from within the rock, and evaporating upon\r\nthe surface, the salts are left as a coat of “alkali”, which is in part\r\ncarried away on the wind and in part washed off in one of the rare\r\ncloudbursts. In either case these constituents find their way to the\r\nlowest depressions of the basin, where they contribute to the saline\r\ndeposits of the desert lakes (Fig. 207).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 208.—Hollowed forms of weathered granite in a\r\ndesert of central Asia (after Walther).]\r\n\r\nCertain of the saline constituents of the rocks, as they are thus\r\ndrawn out by the sun’s rays, fuse with the rock at the surface to form\r\na dense brown substance with smooth surface coat, known as _desert\r\nvarnish_. Within the interior a portion of the salts crystallize within\r\nthe capillary fissures, and like water freezing within a pipe, they\r\nrend the walls apart. As a direct consequence of this disintegrating\r\nprocess the interior of rock masses may crumble into sand; and if the\r\nhard shell of varnish be broken at any point, the wind makes its\r\nentrance and removes the interior portion so as to leave a hollow\r\nshell—the characteristic “pocket rock” (Fig. 208) of the desert. The\r\nnummulitic limestone of Mokkatan and many of the great hewn blocks of\r\nEgyptian limestone sound hollow under the tap of the hammer, and when\r\nbroken, they reveal a shell a few inches only in thickness (Fig. 209).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 209.—Hollow hewn blocks in a wall in the Wadi\r\nGuerraui (after Walther).]\r\n\r\nThe brown desert varnish is one of the most characteristic marks\r\nof an arid country. It is found in all deserts under much the same\r\nconditions, and is especially apt to be present in sandstone. When\r\nscratched, the surface of the rock becomes either cherry-red,\r\nindicating anhydrous ferric oxide, or it is yellowish, due to the\r\nhydrated iron oxide which we know as iron rust. Thus it is seen that\r\nthe sands of deserts, in contrast to those yielded by other processes\r\nwithin humid regions, have a characteristic red color, and this may\r\nvary from brownish red upon the one hand to a rich carmine upon the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The mechanical breakdown of the desert rocks.=—The chemical changes\r\nof decomposition within desert rocks are, as we have seen, largely due\r\nto the action of concentrated solutions of salts at high temperatures.\r\nThat there is a certain mechanical rending of these rocks, due to the\r\n“freezing” of salts within the capillary fissures, has been already\r\nmentioned. A further strain effect arises in rocks like granite, which\r\nare a mixture of different minerals. Heated to a high temperature\r\nduring the day and cooled through a considerable range at night, the\r\ndifferent minerals alternately expand and contract at different rates\r\nand by different relative amounts, so that strains are set up, tending\r\nto tear them apart. The effect of these strains is thus a surface\r\ncrumbling of rocks.\r\n\r\nBut rock is, as already pointed out, a relatively poor conductor of\r\nheat, and hence it is a relatively thin skin only which passes through\r\nthe daily round of wide temperature range. This outer shell when heated\r\nis expanded, and so tends to peel off, or exfoliate, like the outer\r\nskin of an onion. The process is therefore described as _exfoliation_.\r\nIn all rocks of homogeneous texture the continued action of this\r\nprocess results in convexly spherical surfaces, the material scaled\r\noff in the process remaining as a slope or talus which surrounds the\r\nprojecting knob (Fig. 210). Naked, these projecting domes rise above\r\nthe rim of débris at their bases. Not a particle of dust adheres to the\r\nfresh rock surface—no dirt interferes with its glaring whiteness. Yet\r\nclose at hand lie masses of débris into which wells may be carried to\r\ndepths of more than six hundred feet without encountering either solid\r\nrock or ground water. The bare walls of granite sometimes mount upwards\r\nfor thousands of feet into the air, as steep and as inaccessible as the\r\nsquared towers of the Tyrolean Dolomites.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 210.—Smooth granite domes shaped by exfoliation\r\nand surrounded by a rim of talus. Gebel Karsala, Nubian Desert (after\r\nWalther).]\r\n\r\nRock is such a poor conductor of heat that special strains are set\r\nup at the margin of sunlight and shade. This localization of the\r\ndisintegration on the margin of the shaded portions of rock masses is\r\nknown as _shadow weathering_ (see Fig. 215, p. 206).\r\n\r\nThere is, however, still another mechanical disintegrating process\r\ncharacteristic of the desert regions, which is likewise dependent\r\nupon the sudden changes of temperature. Rains, though they may not\r\noccur for a year or more, come as sudden downpours of great volume and\r\nviolence. Rock masses, which are highly heated beneath the desert sun,\r\nif suddenly dashed with water, may be rent apart by the differential\r\nstrains set up near the surface. That rocks may be easily rent as a\r\nresult of sudden chilling is well known to our Northern farmers, who\r\nare accustomed to rid themselves of objectionable bowlders by first\r\nbuilding a fire about them and then dashing water upon their surface.\r\nThus split into fragments, even the larger bowlders may be handled and\r\nso removed from the farming land. The natural process of rock rending\r\nby the occasional cloudburst may be described as _diffission_. Blocks\r\nas much as twenty-five feet in diameter have been observed in the\r\ndesert of western Texas, soon after being broken into several fragments\r\nat the time of a downpour of rain (Fig. 211).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 211.—Granite blocks in the Sierra de los Dolores of Texas, rent\r\ninto several fragments by the dash of rain (after Walther).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The natural sand blast.=—Because of the saucer-like shape, the vast\r\nexpanse, and the absence of wind breaks, the potency of wind as a\r\ngeological agent is in desert areas not easily overestimated. While\r\nmost of its work is accomplished with the aid of tools, it has been\r\nproven that even without this help, considerable work is done through\r\nthe friction of the wind alone, particularly when moving as powerful\r\neddies in cracks and crannies. This wear of the wind, unaided by\r\ncutting tools, is known as _deflation_.\r\n\r\nThe greater work of the wind is, however, accomplished with the aid\r\nof larger or smaller rock particles, the sand and dust, with which it\r\nis so generally charged above the deserts. Unprotected by any mat of\r\nvegetation the materials of the desert surface are easily lifted and\r\nare constantly migrating with the wind. The finest dust is raised high\r\ninto the air, and is carried beyond the marginal barriers, but none of\r\nthe sand or coarser materials ever passes beyond the borders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 212.—“Mushroom rock” from a desert in Wyoming (after Fairbanks).]\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of this sand as a cutting tool when carried by the wind\r\nis directly proportioned to the size of the grain, since with larger\r\nfragments a heavier blow is struck when carried at any given velocity.\r\nThese more effective grains are, however, not lifted far above the\r\nground, but advance with a squirming or hopping motion, much as do\r\nthe larger pebbles upon the bottom of a river at the time of a spring\r\nfreshet. To quote Professor Walther: “Whoever has had the opportunity\r\nto travel over a surface of dune sand when a strong wind is blowing has\r\nfound it easy to convince himself of the grinding action of the wind.\r\nAt such times the ground becomes alive, everywhere the sand is creeping\r\nover the surface with snake-like squirmings, and the eye quickly tires\r\nof these writhing movements of the currents of sand and cannot long\r\nendure the scene.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 213.—Windkanten shaped by the desert sand blast (after Chamberlin\r\nand Salisbury).]\r\n\r\nA direct consequence of this restriction of the more effective cutting\r\ntools to the layer of air just above the ground, is the strong tendency\r\nto cut away all projecting masses near their bases. The “mushroom\r\nrocks”, which are so characteristic of desert landscapes, have been\r\nshaped in this manner (Fig. 212). Another product of the desert\r\nsand blast is the so-called _Windkante_ (wind-edge) or _Dreikante_\r\n(three-edge), a pebble which is usually shaped in the form of a pyramid\r\n(Fig. 213).\r\n\r\nWhenever a rock face, open to direct attack by the drifting sand, is\r\nconstituted of parts which have different hardness, the blast of sand\r\npecks away at the softer places and leaves the harder ones in relief.\r\nThus is produced the well-known “stone lattice” of the desert (Fig.\r\n214). Particularly upon the neck of the great Sphinx have the flying\r\nsand grains, by removing the softer layers, brought the sedimentary\r\nstructures of the sandstone into strong relief.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 214.—The “stone lattice” of the desert, the work of the natural\r\nsand blast (after Walther).]\r\n\r\nWhen guided both by planes of sedimentation and planes of jointing,\r\nforms of a very high degree of ornamentation are developed. Some of\r\nthe most remarkable forms are due to the protection afforded to the\r\nsun-exposed surfaces by the shell of desert varnish. In the shaded\r\nportions of projecting masses there is no such protection, and here the\r\nsand blast insinuates itself into every crack and cranny. In this it is\r\naided by shadow weathering due to the differential strains set up at\r\nthe border of the expanded sun-heated surface. As a result, projecting\r\nrock masses are sometimes etched away beneath and give the effect of a\r\nsquatting animal. These forms, due to shadow erosion, have also been\r\nlikened to projecting faucets. (Fig. 215).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 215.—Projecting rock carved by the drifting sand into the form of\r\na couchant animal as a result of shadow weathering and erosion. Cut in\r\ngranite on the north Indian Desert (after Walther).]\r\n\r\nWorn by its impact upon neighboring sand grains while in transport, but\r\nmuch more as it is thrown against the ground or hard rock surfaces,\r\nthe wind-driven or _eolian_ sand is at last worn into smoothly rounded\r\ngranules which approach the form of a sphere. Compared to the surface\r\nwhich sea sand acquires by attrition, this shaping process is much\r\nthe more efficient, since in the water the beach sand is buoyed up\r\nand is more effectively cushioned against its neighboring grains. The\r\ngrains of beach sand when examined under a microscope are found to be\r\nmuch more irregular in form and usually display the original fracture\r\nsurfaces only in part abraded.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 216.—Cliffs in loess 200 feet in height which exhibit the\r\ncharacteristic vertical jointing (after von Richtofen).]\r\n\r\n=The dust carried out of the desert.=—When, standing upon the mountain\r\nwall that surrounds a desert, the traveler gazes out to windward over\r\nthe great depression, his field of view is generally obscured by the\r\nyellow haze of the dust clouds moving across the margins. Upon the\r\nmountain flanks and extending far outside the borders, this cloud of\r\ndust settles as a shrouding mantle of impalpable yellow powder, which\r\nis known as _loess_. These deposits are continually deepening, and\r\nhave sometimes accumulated until they are hundreds or even thousands\r\nof feet in thickness. Before reaching its final resting place the dust\r\nof this deposit may have settled many times, and has certainly been in\r\npart redistributed by the streams near the desert margin. In it are\r\nthe ingredients which are necessary for the nourishment of plants, and\r\nit constitutes the most important of natural soils. Continually fed by\r\nnew deposits from the desert, and refertilized from below by a natural\r\nprocess so soon as the upper layers become impoverished, it requires no\r\nartificial fertilization. Without artificial aids the loess of northern\r\nChina has been tilled for thousands of years without any signs of\r\nexhaustion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 217.—A cañon in loess worn by traffic and wind. A highway in\r\nnorthern China (after von Richtofen).]\r\n\r\nThough easily pulverized between the fingers, loess is none the less\r\ncharacterized by a perfect vertical jointing and stands on vertical\r\nfaces as does the solid rock (Fig. 216), but it is absolutely devoid\r\nof layers or bedding. Its capacity of standing in vertical cliffs the\r\nloess owes to a never failing content of lime carbonate which acts as a\r\ncement, and to a peculiar porous structure caused by capillary canals\r\nthat run vertically through the mass, branching like rootlets and lined\r\nwith carbonate of lime. This texture once destroyed, loess resolves\r\nitself into a common sticky clay.\r\n\r\nBy the feet of passing animals or by wheels of vehicles, the loess is\r\ncrushed, and a portion is lifted and carried away by the wind. Thus in\r\nthe course of time roadways sink deep into the mass as steep-walled\r\ncañons (Fig. 217). A portion of the now structureless clay remaining\r\nupon the roadway is at the time of the rains transformed into a thick\r\nmud which makes traveling all but impossible, though before its\r\nstructure has been destroyed the loess is perfectly drained to the\r\nbottom of its deposits.\r\n\r\nThe particles which compose the loess are sharply angular quartz\r\nfragments, so fine that all but a few grains can be rubbed into the\r\npores of the skin. Fine scales of mica, such as are easily lifted by\r\nthe wind, are disseminated uniformly throughout the mass. The only\r\ninclosures which are arranged in layers consist of irregularly shaped\r\nconcretions of clay. These show a striking resemblance to ginger roots\r\nand are called by the Chinese “stone ginger”, though they are elsewhere\r\nmore generally known by their German name of _Loessmännchen_, or loess\r\ndolls. These concretions are so disposed in the loess that their longer\r\naxes are vertical, and they were evidently separated from the mass and\r\nnot deposited with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE FEATURES IN DESERT LANDSCAPES\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 218.—Diagrams to illustrate the effects of obstructions of\r\ndifferent types in arresting wind-driven sand. _a_, An unyielding\r\nobstruction which permits the wind to pass through it; _b_, a flexible\r\nand perforated obstruction; _c_, an unyielding closed barrier (after\r\nSchulze).]\r\n\r\n=The wandering dunes.=—Over the broad expanse of the desert, sand\r\nand dust, and occasionally gypsum from the saline deposits, are ever\r\nmigrating with the wind; on quiet days in the eddying “sand devils”,\r\nbut especially during the terrifying sand storms such as in the windy\r\nseason darken the air of northern China and southern Manchuria. This\r\ndrift of the sand is halted only when an obstruction is encountered—a\r\nprojecting rock, a bush, or a bunch of grass, or again the buildings of\r\na city or a town. The manner in which the sand is arrested by obstacles\r\nof different kinds is of great interest and importance, and is utilized\r\nin raising defenses against its encroachments. If the obstacle is\r\nunyielding but allows some of the wind to pass through it, no eddies\r\nare produced and the sand is deposited both to windward and to leeward\r\nof the obstruction to form a fairly symmetrical mound (Fig. 218 _a_).\r\nAn obstruction which yields to the wind causes the sand to deposit\r\nin a mound which is largely to leeward of the obstruction (Fig. 218\r\n_b_). A solid wall, on the other hand, by inducing eddies, is at first\r\nprotected from the sand and mounds deposit both to windward and to\r\nleeward (Fig. 218 _c_ and Fig. 219).\r\n\r\nExcept when held up by an obstruction, the drifting sand travels\r\nto leeward in slowly migrating mounds or ridges which are known as\r\n_dunes_. Their motion is due to the wind lifting the sand from the\r\nwindward side and carrying it over the crest, from where it slides down\r\nthe leeward slope and assumes a surface which is the angle of repose\r\nof the material. In contrast with this the windward slope is notably\r\ngradual, being shaped in conformity to the wind currents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 219.—Sand accumulating both to windward and to leeward of a firm\r\nand impenetrable obstruction. The wind comes from the left (after a\r\nphotograph by Bastin).]\r\n\r\nThe dunes which are raised upon seashores, like those of the desert,\r\nare constantly migrating, those upon the shores of the North Sea at the\r\naverage rate of about twenty feet per year. Relentlessly they advance,\r\nand despite all attempts to halt them, have many times overwhelmed the\r\nvillages along the coast. Upon the great barrier beach known as the\r\n_Kurische Nehrung_, on the southeastern shore of the Baltic Sea, such\r\na burial of villages has more than once occurred, but as in the course\r\nof time further migration of the dune has proceeded, the ruins of the\r\nburied villages have been exhumed by this natural excavating process\r\n(Fig. 220).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 220.—Successive diagrams to show how the town of Kunzen was\r\nburied, and subsequently exhumed in the continued migration of a great\r\ndune upon the Kurische Nehrung (after Behrendt).]\r\n\r\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n│  PLATE 7.                                                           │\r\n│                                                                     │\r\n│ [Illustration: _A._ Ranges of dunes upon the margin of the Colorado │\r\n│ Desert (after Mendenhall).]                                         │\r\n│                                                                     │\r\n│ [Illustration: _B._ Sand dunes encroaching upon the oasis of Wed    │\r\n│ Souf.

Kearney).]                               │\r\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\r\n\r\n\r\n=The forms of dunes.=—The forms assumed by dunes are dependent to\r\na very large extent upon the strength of the wind and the available\r\nsupply of sand. With small quantities of sand and with moderate winds,\r\nsickle-shaped dunes known as _barchans_ (Fig. 221) are formed, whose\r\nconvex and flatter slopes are toward the wind and whose steep concave\r\nleeward slopes are maintained at the angle of repose. The barchan is\r\nshaped by the wind going both over and around the dune, constantly\r\nremoving sand from the windward side and depositing it to leeward.\r\nWith larger supplies of sand and winds which are not too violent a\r\nseries of barchans is built up, and these are arranged transversely to\r\nthe wind direction (Fig. 222 _b_). If the winds are more violent, the\r\nminor depressions in the crests of the dunes become wind channels, and\r\nthe sand is then trailed out along them until the arrangement of the\r\nridges is parallel to the wind (Fig. 222 _c_). The surfaces of dunes\r\nare generally marked by beautiful ripples in the sand, which, seen from\r\na little distance, may give the appearance of watered silk (plate 7 A).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 221.—View of desert barchans (after Haug).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 222.—Diagrams to show the relationships in form and in\r\norientation of dunes to the supply of sand and to the strength of the\r\nwind. _a_, barchans formed by small supplies of sand and moderate\r\nwinds; _b_, transverse dune ridges, formed when supply of sand is large\r\nand winds are moderate; _c_, dune ridges formed with large sand supply\r\nand violent winds (after Walther and Cornish).]\r\n\r\nUnder normal conditions dunes are not stationary but continue to wander\r\nwith the prevailing winds until they have reached the outer edge of\r\nthe zone of vegetation near the base of the foothills at the margin of\r\nthe desert. Here the grasses and other desert plants arrest the first\r\nsand grains that reach them, and they continue to grow higher as the\r\nsands accumulate. Some of the desert plants, like the yuccas, have so\r\nadapted themselves to desert conditions that they may grow upward with\r\nthe sand for many feet and so keep their crowns above its surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The cloudburst in the desert.=—Such clouds as enter the desert\r\nthrough its mountain ramparts, and those derived from evaporation\r\nfrom the hot desert soil, usually precipitate their moisture before\r\npassing out of the basin. Above the highly heated floor the heavy\r\nrain clouds are unable to drop their burden. The rain can sometimes\r\nbe seen descending, but long before it has reached the ground it has\r\nagain passed into vapor, and through repetition of this process the\r\nclouds become so charged with moisture that when they encounter a\r\nmountain wall and are thus forced to rise, there is a sudden downpour\r\nnot equaled in the humid regions. Desert rains are rare, but violent\r\nbeyond comparison. Often for a year or more there is no rainfall upon\r\nthe loose sand or porous clay, and the few plants which survive must\r\npush their roots deep down until they have reached the zone of ground\r\nwater. When the clouds burst, each small cañon or _wed_ (pl. _wadi_)\r\nwithin the mountain wall is quickly occupied by a swollen current\r\nwhich carries a thick paste of sediment and drowns everything before\r\nit. Ere it has flowed a mile, it may be that the water has disappeared\r\nentirely, leaving a layer of mud and sand which rapidly dries out with\r\nthe reappearance of the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 223.—Ideal section across the rising mountain wall\r\nsurrounding a desert and a part of the neighboring slope (after R. W.\r\nPumpelly).]\r\n\r\nAs the mountains upon seacoasts are generally rising with reference to\r\nthe neighboring sea bottom, so the mountains which hem in the deserts\r\nare generally growing upward with reference to the inclosed desert\r\nfloor. The marginal dislocations which separate the two are often in\r\nevidence at the foot of the steep slope (Fig. 223), and these may even\r\nappear as visible earthquake faults to indicate that the uplift is\r\nmore accelerated than the deposition along the mountain front.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 224.—Dry delta or alluvial fan at the foot of a mountain range\r\nupon the borders of a desert.]\r\n\r\n=The zone of the dwindling river.=—The rapid uplift so generally\r\ncharacteristic of desert margins gives to the torrential streams which\r\ndevelop after each cloudburst such an unusual velocity that when they\r\nemerge from the mountain valleys on to the desert floor, the current\r\nis suddenly checked and the burden of sediment in large part deposited\r\nat the mouth of the valley so as to form a coarse delta deposit which\r\nis described as a _dry delta_ (Fig. 224). Dependent upon its steepness\r\nof slope, this delta is variously referred to as an _alluvial fan_\r\nor _apron_, or as an _alluvial cone_. Over the conical slopes of the\r\ndelta surface the stream is broken up into numerous distributaries\r\nwhich divide and subdivide as do the roots of a tree. In the Mohammedan\r\ncountries described as _wadi_, these distributaries upon dry deltas are\r\non the Pacific coast of the United States referred to as “washes” (Fig.\r\n225).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 225.—Map of the distributaries of neighboring\r\nstreams which emerge at the western base of the Sierra Nevadas in\r\nCalifornia (after W. D. Johnson).]\r\n\r\nFast losing their velocity after emerging from the mountains, the\r\nvarious distributaries drop first of all the heavy bowlders, then\r\nthe large pebbles and the sand, so that only the finer sand and the\r\nsilt are carried to the margin of the delta. As they enlarge their\r\nboundaries, the neighboring deltas eventually coalesce and so form an\r\n_alluvial bench_ or “gravel piedmont” at the foot of the range. Only\r\nthe larger streams are able to entirely cross this bench of parched\r\ndeposits with its coarsely porous structure, for the water is soon\r\nsucked up by the thirsty materials. Encountering in its descent more\r\nclayey layers, this water is conducted to the surface near the margin\r\nof the bench and may there appear as a line of springs. At this level\r\nthere develops, therefore, a zone of vegetation, though there is no\r\nlocal rain.\r\n\r\nThe alluvial bench grows upward by accretion of layers which are\r\nthickest at the mountain end, so that the steepness of the bench\r\nincreases with time.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Erosion in and about the desert.=—The violent cloudburst that is\r\ncharacteristic of the arid lands is a most potent agent in modeling\r\nthe surface of the ground wherever the rock materials are not too\r\nfirmly coherent. Under the dash of the rain a peculiar type of “bad\r\nland” topography is developed (plate 5 B and Fig. 226). Such a\r\nrain-cut surface is a veritable maze of alternating gully and ridge, a\r\ncountry worthless for agricultural purposes and offering the greatest\r\ndifficulty in the way of penetrating it. When composed of stiff clay\r\nwith scattered pebbles and bowlders, the effect of the “rain erosion”\r\nis to fashion steep clay pillars each capped by a pebble and described\r\nas “demoiselles” (Fig. 226).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 226.—A group of “demoiselles” in the “bad lands” (after a\r\nphotograph by Fairbanks).]\r\n\r\nBehind the mountain front the valleys out of which the torrents are\r\ndischarged are usually short with steep side walls and a relatively\r\nflat bottom, ending headward in an amphitheater with precipitous walls\r\n(Fig. 227). In the western United States such valleys are referred to\r\nas “box cañons”, but in Mohammedan countries the name “wed” applies to\r\nthe river valley within the mountains and to the distributaries as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Characteristic features of the arid lands.=—It is characteristic of\r\nerosion and deposition within humid regions that all outlines become\r\nsoftened into flowing curves, due to the protective mat of vegetation.\r\nIn arid lands those massive rocks which are without structural planes\r\nof separation, partly as a consequence of exfoliation, develop broad\r\ndomes which are projected upon the horizon as great semicircles,\r\nbroken in half it may be by displacement. The same massive rocks where\r\nintersected by vertical joint planes yield, on the contrary, sharp\r\ngranite needles like those of Harney Peak (plate 8 A). Similarly,\r\nschistose or bedded rocks, when tilted at a high angle, may yield forms\r\nwhich are almost identical. Examples of such needles are found in the\r\nGarden of the Gods in Colorado.\r\n\r\nAt lower levels, where the flying sand becomes effective as an eroding\r\nagent, flat bedded rocks become etched into shelves and cornices, and\r\nif intersected by joints, the shelves and cornices are transformed\r\ninto groups of castellated towers and pinnacles of a high degree of\r\nornamentation. These fantastic erosion remnants are usually referred to\r\nas “chimneys” and may be seen in numbers in the bad lands of Dakota, as\r\nthey may in Colorado either in Monument Park or in the new Monolithic\r\nNational Park (plate 8 B).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 227.—Amphitheater at the head of the Wed Beni Sur (after\r\nWalther).]\r\n\r\nWhere wind erosion plays a smaller rôle in the sculpture, but where\r\nafter an uplift a river has made its way, horizontally bedded rocks\r\nare apt to be carved into broad _rock terraces_, nowhere shown upon so\r\ngrand a scale as about the Grand Cañon of the Colorado. Each harder\r\nlayer has here produced a floor or terrace which ends in a vertical\r\nescarpment, and this is separated from the next lower layer of more\r\nresistant rock by a slope of talus which largely hides the softer\r\nintermediate beds. The great Desert of Sahara is shaped in a series of\r\nrock terraces or steppes which descend toward the interior of the basin.\r\n\r\nA single harder layer of resistant rock comes often to form the\r\nflat capping of a plateau, and is then known as a _mesa_, or table\r\nmountain. Along its front, detached outliers usually stand like\r\nsentinels before the larger mass, and according to their relative\r\nproportions, these are referred to either as small mesas or as the\r\nsmaller _buttes_ (Fig. 228).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 228.—Mesa and outlying butte in the Leucite Hills\r\nof Wyoming (after Whitman Cross, U. S. G. S.).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The war of dune and oasis.=—In every desert the deposits are arranged\r\nin consecutive belts or zones which are alternately the work of wind\r\nand water. Surrounding the desert and upon the flanks of the mountain\r\nwall there is found (1) the deposit of loess derived from the dust that\r\nis carried out of the desert by the wind. Immediately within the desert\r\nborder at the base of the mountains is (2) the zone of the dwindling\r\nriver with its sloping bench of coarse rubble and gravel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 229.—Flat-bottomed basin separating dunes—_bajir_\r\nor _takyr_ (after Ellsworth Huntington).]\r\n\r\nNext in order is (3) the belt of the flying sand, a zone of dune\r\nridges often separated by narrow, flat-bottomed basins (Fig. 229) into\r\nwhich the strongest streams bring the finer sands and silt from the\r\nmountains. Lastly, there is (4) the central sink or sinks, into which\r\nall water not at once absorbed within the zone of alluviation or in\r\nthe zone of dunes is finally collected. Here are the true lacustrine\r\ndeposits of clay and separated salts (Fig. 230 and Fig. 207, p. 201).\r\nThe lake deposits fill in all the original irregularities of the desert\r\nfloor, out of which the tops of isolated ranges of mountains now\r\nproject like islands out of the surface of the sea. The several zones\r\nof deposits in their order from the margin to the center of the desert\r\nare given schematically in Fig. 231.\r\n\r\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n│  PLATE 8.                                                           │\r\n│                                                                     │\r\n│ [Illustration: _A._ The granite needles of Harney Peak in the Black │\r\n│ Hills of South Dakota (after Darton).]                              │\r\n│                                                                     │\r\n│ [Illustration: _B._ Castellated erosion chimneys in El Cobra Cañon, │\r\n│ New Mexico.                                                         │\r\n│ (_Photograph by E.

Just without the line of oases is the wall of\r\ndunes held back from further advance only by the vegetation which in\r\nturn is dependent upon the rains in the neighboring mountains. With\r\nevery diminution in the water supply, the dunes advance and encroach\r\nupon the oases (plate 7 B); while with every considerable increase in\r\nthis supply of moisture the alluvial bench advances over the dunes and\r\nacquires a strip of their territory. Thus with varying fortunes a war\r\nis continually waged between the withering river and the flying sand,\r\nand the alternations of climate are later recorded in the dovetailing\r\ntogether of the eolian and alluvial deposits at their common junction\r\n(Fig. 231).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 231.—Schematic diagram to show the zones of\r\ndeposition in their order from the margin to the center of a desert.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 232.—Mounds upon the site of the buried city of Nippur (after the\r\ncast by Muret).]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the smaller periodic alternations of pluvial and\r\ninterpluvial climate—the “pulse of Asia”—the record of the Asiatic\r\ndeserts indicates a progressive desiccation of the entire region, which\r\nhas now given the victory to the dune. The ancient history of the\r\ncities of the plains supplies the records of many that have been buried\r\nin the dunes. To-day, where once were prosperous cities, nothing is to\r\nbe seen at the surface but a group of mounds (Fig. 232). Exhumed after\r\nmuch painstaking labor, the walls and palaces of these ancient cities\r\nhave once more been brought to the light of day, and much has thus been\r\nlearned of the civilization of these early times (Fig. 233). Quite\r\nrecently the mounds which cover between one and two hundred buried\r\nvillages have been found upon the borders of the Tarim basin of central\r\nAsia, where they were lost to history when they were overwhelmed in the\r\nearly centuries of the Christian Era.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 233.—Exhumed structures in the buried city of\r\nNippur (after Hilprecht).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The origin of the high plains which front the Rocky Mountains.=—To\r\nthe eastward of the great backbone of the North American continent\r\nstretches a vast plain gently inclined away from the range and\r\ngenerally known as the High Plains region (plate 9). The tourist who\r\ntravels westward by train ascends this slope so gradually that when he\r\nhas reached the mountain front it is difficult to realize that he has\r\nclimbed to an altitude of five thousand feet above the level of the\r\nsea. That he has also passed through several climatic zones—a humid, a\r\nsemiarid, and an arid—and has now entered a semiarid district, is more\r\neasily appreciated from study of the vegetation (Fig. 234). The surface\r\nof the High Plains, where not cut into by rivers, is remarkably even,\r\nso that it might be compared to the quiet surface of a great lake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 234.—Section across the High Plains, showing the\r\nposition of the terrace and the climatic zones above it (after W. D.\r\nJohnson).]\r\n\r\nThe materials which compose the surface veneer of these plains are\r\ncoarse conglomerates, gravels, and sands, and the so-called “mortar\r\nbeds”, which are nothing but sands cemented into sandstone by carbonate\r\nof lime. The pebbles in all these deposits are far-traveled and appear\r\nto have been derived from erosion of those crystalline rocks which\r\ncompose the eastern front of the Rocky Mountains. These different\r\nmaterials are not arranged in strictly parallel beds, as are the\r\ndeposits of a lake or sea; but the beds are made up of long threads of\r\nlenticular cross section which are interlaced in the most intricate\r\nfashion and which extend down the slope, or outward from the mountain\r\nfront (Fig. 235). It is thus shown that the High Plains are a bench or\r\nplain of alluviation formed at the front of the Rocky Mountains during\r\nan earlier series of pluvial periods, and that subsequent uplift has\r\nproduced the modern river valleys which are cut out of the plain. The\r\nplexus of long threads of the coarser materials are the courses of\r\ndwindling rivers which interlaced over the former plain, and which in\r\ntime were buried under other channel deposits of the same nature but in\r\ndifferent positions (Fig. 236). The pluvial periods in which this bench\r\nwas formed produced in other latitudes the great continental glaciers\r\nwhich wrought such marvelous changes in northern North America and in\r\nnorthern Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 235.—Section across the great lenticular threads\r\nof alluvial deposits which compose the veneer of the High Plains (after\r\nW. D. Johnson).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 236.—Distributaries of the foothills superimposed\r\nupon an earlier series (after W. D. Johnson).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Character profiles.=—In contrast with the profiles in the landscapes\r\nof humid regions (see Fig. 187, p. 177), those of arid lands are\r\nmarked by straighter elements (Fig. 237). Almost the only exception\r\nof importance is furnished by the domes of massive granite monoliths,\r\nwhich are sometimes broken in half by great displacements. Below\r\nthe horizon the secondary lines in the landscape betray the same\r\nstraightness of the component elements by the gabled slopes of talus\r\nwhich are many times repeated so as almost to reproduce the lines in\r\na house of cards, since the sloping lines are maintained at the angle\r\nof repose of the materials (Fig. 482, p. 443). Wherever the waves of\r\ndesert lakes have made an attack upon the rocks and have retired the\r\nprojecting spurs, other gables characterized by slightly different\r\nslopes are introduced into the landscape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 237.—Character profiles in the landscapes of arid\r\nlands.]\r\n\r\n┌─────────────────────────────────┐\r\n│   PLATE 9.                      │\r\n│                                 │\r\n│ [Illustration: THE HIGH PLAINS] │\r\n└─────────────────────────────────┘\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING REFERENCES FOR CHAPTERS XV AND XVI\r\n\r\n General:—\r\n\r\n JOHANNES WALTHER.

Throughout large areas these fractures may maintain nearly\r\nconstant directions, though either one or more of the master series\r\nmay be locally absent. This distinctive architecture of the surface\r\nshell of the lithosphere has exercised its influence upon the various\r\nweathering processes, as it has also upon the activities of running\r\nwater and of other less common transporting agencies at the surface.\r\n\r\nWithin high latitudes, where frost action is the dominant weathering\r\nprocess, the water, by insinuating itself along the joints and\r\nthrough repeated freezings, has broken down the rock in the immediate\r\nneighborhood of these fractures, and so has impressed upon the surface\r\nan image of the underlying pattern of structure lines (plate 10 A).\r\n\r\nIn much lower latitudes and in regions of insufficient rainfall, the\r\nsame structures are impressed upon the relief, but by other weathering\r\nprocesses. In the case of the less coherent deposits in these\r\nprovinces, the initial forms of their erosional surface have sometimes\r\nbeen determined by the dash of rain from the sudden cloudburst. Thus\r\nthe “bad lands” may have their initial gullies directed and spaced in\r\nconformity with the underlying joint structures (Fig. 238).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 238.—Rain sculpturing under control by joints. Coast of southern\r\nCalifornia (after a photograph by Fairbanks).]\r\n\r\nIn such portions of the temperate regions as are favored by a humid\r\nclimate, the mat of vegetation holds down a layer of soil, and mat\r\nand soil in coöperation are effective in preventing any such large\r\nmeasure of frostwork as is characteristic of the subpolar regions or\r\nof high levels in the arid lands. In humid regions the rocks become a\r\nprey especially to the processes of solution and accompanying chemical\r\ndecomposition, and these processes, although guided by the course of\r\nthe percolating ground water along the fracture planes, do not afford\r\nsuch striking examples of the control of surface relief.\r\n\r\nThose limestones which slowly pass into solution in the percolating\r\nwater do, however, quite generally indicate a localization of the\r\nsolution along the joint channels (Fig. 239 and plate 6 B). Though in\r\nother rocks not so apparent, yet solutions generally take their courses\r\nalong the same channels, and upon them is localized the development\r\nof the newly formed hydrated and carbonate minerals, as is well\r\nillustrated by the phenomenon of spheroidal weathering (Fig. 155, p.\r\n150).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 239.—Outcrop of flaggy limestone which shows the effects of\r\nsolution along neighboring joints in a sagging of the upper beds (after\r\nGilbert, U. S. G. S.).]\r\n\r\n=The fracture control of the drainage lines.=—The etching out of\r\nthe earth’s architectural plan in the surface relief, which we have\r\nseen begun in the processes of weathering, is continued after the\r\ntransporting agents have become effective. It is often easy to see\r\nthat a river has taken its course in rectangular zigzags like the\r\nelbows of a jointed stove pipe, and that its walls are formed of joint\r\nplanes from which an occasional squared buttress projects into the\r\nchannel. This structure is rendered in the plan of the Abisko Cañon of\r\nnorthern Lapland (Fig. 240). We are later to learn that another great\r\ntransporting agent, the water wave, makes a selective attack upon the\r\nlithosphere along the fractures of the joint system (Fig. 250, p. 233\r\nand Fig. 254, p. 235).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 240.—Map of the joint-controlled Abisko Cañon in northern Lapland\r\n(after Otto Sjögren).]\r\n\r\nWhere the scale of the example is large, as in the cases which have\r\nbeen above cited, the actual position and directions of the joint wall\r\nare easily compared with the near-by elements of the river’s course,\r\nso that the connection of the drainage lines with the underlying\r\nstructure is at once apparent. In many examples where the scale\r\nis small, the evidence for the controlling influence of the rock\r\nstructure in determining the courses of streams may be found in the\r\npeculiar character of the drainage plan. To illustrate: the course of\r\nthe Zambesi River, within the gorge below the famous Victoria Falls,\r\nnot only makes repeated turnings at a right angle, but its tributary\r\nstreams, instead of making the usual sharp angle where they join the\r\nmain stream, also affect the right angle in their junctions (Fig. 241).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 241.—Map of the gorge of the Zambesi River below the Victoria\r\nFalls (after Lamplugh).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The repeating pattern in drainage networks.=—It is a characteristic\r\nof the joint system that the fractures within each series are spaced\r\nwith approximation to uniformity. If the plan of a drainage system has\r\nbeen regulated in conformity with the architecture of the underlying\r\nrock basement, the same repeating rectangles of the master joints may\r\nbe expected to appear in the lines of drainage—the so-called drainage\r\nnetwork.\r\n\r\nSuch rectangular patterns do very generally appear in the drainage\r\nnetwork, though they are often masked upon modern maps by what, to\r\nthe geologist, seems impertinent intrusion of the black lines of\r\noverprinting which indicate railways, lines of highway, and other\r\nculture elements. On river maps, which are printed without culture, the\r\npattern is much more easily recognized (Figs. 242 and 243). Wherever\r\nthe relief is strong, as is the case in the Adirondack Mountain\r\nprovince of the State of New York, individual hills may stand in relief\r\nbetween the bounding streams which compose the rectangular network,\r\nlike the squared pedestals of monuments. Such a type of relief carved\r\nin repeating patterns has been described as “checkerboard topography.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 242.—Controlled drainage network of the Shepaug River in\r\nConnecticut.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 243.—A river network of repeating rectangular pattern. Near Lake\r\nTemiskaming, Ontario (from the map by the Dominion Government).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The dividing lines of the relief patterns—lineaments.=—The repeating\r\ndesign outlined in the river network of the Temiskaming district\r\n(Fig. 243) would appear in greater perfection if we could reproduce\r\nthe relief without at the same time obscuring the lines of drainage;\r\nfor where the pattern is not completely closed by the course of the\r\nstream, there is generally found either a dry valley or a ravine to\r\ncomplete the design. If these are not present, a bit of straight\r\ncoast line, a visible line of fracture, a zone of fault breccia, or\r\nthe boundary line separating different formations may one or more of\r\nthem fill in the gaps of the parallel straight drainage lines which by\r\ntheir intersection bring out the pattern. These significant lines of\r\nlandscapes which reveal the hidden architecture of the rock basement\r\nare described as _lineaments_ (Fig. 82, p. 87). They are the character\r\nlines of the earth’s physiognomy.\r\n\r\nIt is important to emphasize the essentially composite expression of\r\nthe lineament. At one locality it appears as a drainage line, a little\r\nfarther on it may be a line of coast; then, again, it is a series of\r\naligned waterfalls, a visible fault trace, or a rectilinear boundary\r\nbetween formations; but in every case it is some surface expression\r\nof a buried fracture. Hidden as they so generally are, the fracture\r\nlines must be searched out by every means at our disposal, if we are\r\nnot to be misled in accounting for the positions and the attitudes of\r\ndisturbed rock masses.\r\n\r\nAs we have learned, during earthquake shocks, as at no other time,\r\nthe surface of the earth is so sensitized as to betray the position\r\nof its buried fractures. As the boundaries of orographic blocks,\r\ncertain of the fractures are at such times the seats of especially\r\nheavy vibrations; they are the seismotectonic lines of the earthquake\r\nprovince. Many lineaments are identical with seismotectonic lines, and\r\nthey therefore afford a means of to some extent determining in advance\r\nthe lines of greatest danger from earthquake shock.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The composite repeating patterns of the higher orders.=—Not only\r\ndo the larger joint blocks become impressed upon the earth relief as\r\nrepeating diaper patterns, but larger and still larger composite units\r\nof the same type may, in favorable districts, be found to present the\r\nsame characters. Attention has already been more than once directed\r\nto the fact that the more perfect and prominent fracture planes recur\r\namong the joints of any series at more or less regular intervals (Fig.\r\n40, p. 57, and Fig. 41, p. 58). Nowhere, perhaps, is this larger order\r\nof the repeating pattern more perfectly exemplified than in some recent\r\ndeposits in the Syrian desert (plate 10 B). It is usually, however,\r\nin the older sediments that such structures may be recognized; as, for\r\nexample, in the squared towers and buttresses of the Tyrolean Dolomites\r\n(Fig. 244). Here the larger blocks appear in the thick bedded lower\r\nformation, the dolomite, divided into subordinate sections of large\r\ndimensions; but in the overlying formations in blocks of relatively\r\nsmall size, yet with similarly perfect subequal spacing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 244.—Squared mountain masses which reveal a distribution of the\r\njoints in block patterns of different orders of magnitude. The Pordoi\r\nrange of the Sella group of the Dolomites, seen from the Cima di Rossi\r\n(after Mojsisovics).]\r\n\r\nThe observing traveler who is privileged to make the journey by\r\nsteamer, threading its course in and out among the many islands and\r\nskerries of the Norwegian coast, will hardly fail to be struck by the\r\nremarkable profiles of most of the lower islands (Fig. 245). These\r\nprofiles are generally convexly scalloped with a noteworthy regularity,\r\nand not in one unit only, but in at least two with one a multiple of\r\nthe other (Fig. 246). As the steamer passes near to the islands, it is\r\ndiscovered that the smaller recognizable units in the island profiles\r\nare separated by widely gaping joints which do not, however, belong\r\nto the unit series, but to a larger composite group (Fig. 246 _b_).\r\nFrostwork, which depends for its action upon open spaces within the\r\nrocks, has here been the cause of the excessive weathering above the\r\nmore widely gaping joints.\r\n\r\n┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n│   PLATE 10.                                                          │\r\n│                                                                      │\r\n│ [Illustration: _A._ View in Spitzbergen to illustrate the            │\r\n│ disintegration of rock under the control of joints.                  │\r\n│ (_Photograph by O.

Each particle of water, through its friction upon\r\nneighboring particles, is able to transmit its motion both along the\r\nsurface and downward into the water below. The force which starts the\r\nwater in motion and develops the wave, is the friction of wind blowing\r\nover the water surface, and the size of the orbit of the water particle\r\nat any point is proportional to the wind’s force and to the stretch\r\nof water over which it has blown. The wind’s effect is, therefore,\r\ncumulative—the wave is proportional to the wind’s effect upon all\r\nwater particles in its rear, added to the local wind friction.\r\n\r\nThe size or _height_ of the wave is measured by the diameter of the\r\norbit of motion of the surface particle, and this is the difference in\r\nheight between trough and crest. The distance from crest to crest, or\r\nfrom trough to trough, is called the _wave length_. Though the wave\r\nmotion is transmitted downward into the water there is a continued\r\nloss of energy which is here not compensated by added wind friction,\r\nand so the orbital motion grows smaller and smaller, until at the\r\ndepth of about a wave length it has completely died out. This level\r\nof no motion is called the _wave base_. In quiet weather the level of\r\nno motion is practically at the water’s surface, and inasmuch as the\r\ngeological work of waves is in large part accomplished during the great\r\nstorms, the term “wave base” refers to the lowest level of wave motion\r\nat the time of the heaviest storms. Upon the ocean the highest waves\r\nthat have been measured have an amplitude of about fifty feet and a\r\nwave length of about six hundred feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Free waves and breakers.=—So long as the depth of the water is below\r\nwave base, there is obviously no possibility of interference with the\r\nwave through friction upon the bottom. Under these conditions waves are\r\ndescribed as _free waves_, and their forms are symmetrical except in so\r\nfar as their crests are pulled over and more or less dissipated in the\r\nspray of the “white caps” at the time of high winds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 248.—Diagram to illustrate the transformation of a\r\nfree wave into a breaker as it approaches the shore.]\r\n\r\nAs a wave approaches a shore, which generally has a gentle outward\r\nsloping surface, there is interposed in the way of a free forward\r\nmovement the friction upon the bottom. This friction begins when the\r\ndepth of water is less than wave base, and its effect is to hold back\r\nthe wave at the bottom. Carried slowly upward in the water by the\r\nfriction of particle upon particle, the effect of this holding back\r\nis a piling up of the water, which increases the wave height as it\r\ndiminishes the wave length, and also interferes with wave symmetry\r\n(Fig. 248). Moving forward at the top under its inertia of motion and\r\nheld back at the bottom by constantly increasing friction, a strong\r\nturning motion or couple is started about a horizontal axis, the\r\nimmediate effect of which is to steepen the forward slope of the wave,\r\nand this continues until it overhangs, and, falling, “breaks” into\r\nsurf. Such a breaking wave is called a “comber” or “breaker” (plate 11\r\nB).\r\n\r\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n│   PLATE 11.                                                     │\r\n│                                                                 │\r\n│ [Illustration: _A._ Ripple markings within an ancient sandstone │\r\n│ (courtesy of U.

Profile Rock at Farwell’s\r\nPoint near Madison, Wisconsin.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Effect of the breaking wave upon a steep rocky shore—the notched\r\ncliff.=—If the shore rises abruptly from deeper water, the top of\r\nthe breaking wave is hurled against the cliff with the force of a\r\nbattering ram. During storms the water of shore waves is charged with\r\nsand, and each sand particle is driven like a stone cutter’s tool\r\nunder the stroke of his hammer. The effect is thus both to chip and\r\nto batter away the rock of the shore to the height reached by the\r\nwave, undermining it and notching the rock at its base (Fig. 249).\r\nWhen the notch has been cut in this manner to a sufficient depth, the\r\noverhanging rock falls by its own weight in blocks which are bounded\r\nby the ever present joints, leaving the upper cliff face essentially\r\nvertical.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 250.—A wave-cut chasm under control by joints, coast of Maine\r\n(after Tarr).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Coves, sea arches, and stacks.=—It is the headland which is most\r\nexposed to the work of the waves, since with change of wind direction\r\nit is exposed upon more than a single face. The study of headlands\r\nwhich have been cut by waves shows that the joints within the rock\r\nplay a large rôle in the shaping of shore features. The attack of the\r\nwaves under the direction of these planes of ready separation opens\r\nout indentations of the shore (Fig. 250) or forms _sea caves_ which, as\r\nthey extend to the top of the cliff by the process of sapping, yield\r\nthe _coves_ which are so common a feature upon our rock-bound shores\r\n(Fig. 259, p. 238). With continuation of this process, the caves formed\r\non opposite sides of the headland may be united to form a _sea arch_\r\n(Fig. 251).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 251.—The sea arch known as the Grand Arch upon one of the\r\nApostle Islands in Lake Superior (after a photograph by the Detroit\r\nPhotographic Company).]\r\n\r\nA later stage in this selective wave carving under the control of\r\njoints is reached when the bridge above the arch has fallen in, leaving\r\na detached rock island with precipitous walls. Such an offshore island\r\nof rock with precipitous sides is known as a _stack_ (Fig. 252), or\r\nsometimes as a “chimney”, though this latter term is best restricted to\r\nother and similar forms which are the product of selective weathering\r\n(p. 300).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 252.—Stack near the shore of Lake Superior.]\r\n\r\nWhenever the rock is less firmly consolidated, and so does not stand\r\nupon such steep planes, the stack is apt to have a more conical form,\r\nand may not be preceded in its formation by the development of the\r\nsea arch (Fig. 260, p. 239). In the reverse case, or where the rock\r\npossesses an unusual tenacity, the stack may be largely undermined\r\nand stand supported like a table upon thick legs or pillars of rock\r\n(Fig. 253). In Fig. 254 is seen a group of stacks upon the coast of\r\nCalifornia, which show with clearness the control of the joints in\r\ntheir formation, but unlike the marble of the South American example\r\nthe forms are not rounded, but retain their sharp angles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 253.—The Marble Islands, stacks in Lake Buenos Aires, southern\r\nAndes (after F. P. Moreno).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The cut rock terrace.=—When waves first begin their attack upon a\r\nsteep, rocky shore, the lower limit of the action is near the wave\r\nbase. The action at this depth is, however, less efficient, and as the\r\nrecession of the cliff is one of the most rapid of erosional processes,\r\nthe rock floor outside the receding cliff comes to slope gradually\r\ndownward from the cliff to a maximum depth at the edge of the terrace,\r\napproximately equal to wave base (Fig. 255). This cut terrace is\r\nextended seaward or lakeward, as the case may be, in a _built terrace_\r\nconstructed from a portion of the rock débris acquired from the cliff.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 254.—Squared stacks which reveal the position of the joint planes\r\nwhich have controlled in the process of carving by the waves. Pt.\r\nBuchon, California (after a photograph by Fairbanks).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 255.—Ideal section of a steep rocky shore carved by waves into a\r\nnotched cliff and cut terrace, and extended by a built terrace.]\r\n\r\nThe broken wave, after rising upon the terrace under the inertia of\r\nits motion until all its energy has been dissipated, slides outward\r\nby gravity, and though checked and overridden by succeeding breakers,\r\nit continues its outward slide as the “undertow” until it reaches the\r\nend of the terrace. Here it suddenly enters deep water, and losing its\r\nvelocity, drops its burden of rock, and builds the terrace seaward\r\nafter the manner of construction of an embankment. As we are to see,\r\nthe larger portion of the wave-quarried material is diverted to a\r\ndifferent quarter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 256.—Map showing the outlines of the Island of Heligoland at\r\ndifferent stages in its recent history. The peripheries given are in\r\nmiles.]\r\n\r\nTo gain some conception of the importance of wave cutting as an eroding\r\nprocess, we may consider the late history of Heligoland, a sandstone\r\nisland off the mouth of the Elbe in the North Sea (Fig. 256). From a\r\nperiphery of 120 miles, which it possessed in the ninth century of the\r\nChristian era, the island has reduced its outline to 45 miles in the\r\nfourteenth century, 8 miles in the seventeenth, and to about 3 miles at\r\nthe beginning of the twentieth century. The German government, which\r\nrecently acquired this little remnant from England, has expended large\r\nsums of money in an effort to save this last relic.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 257.—Cut and built terrace with bowlder pavement shaped by waves\r\non a steep shore formed of loose materials.]\r\n\r\n=The cut and built terrace on a steep shore of loose materials.=—In\r\nmaterials which lack the coherence of firm rock, no vertical cliff can\r\nform; for as fast as undermined by the waves the loose materials slide\r\ndown and assume a surface of practically constant slope—the “angle of\r\nrepose” of the materials (Fig. 257). The terrace below this sloping\r\ncliff will not differ in shape from that cut upon a rocky shore; but\r\nwhenever the materials of the shore include disseminated blocks too\r\nlarge for the waves to handle, they collect upon the terrace near where\r\nthey have been exhumed, thus forming what has been called a “bowlder\r\npavement” (Fig. 258).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 258.—Sloping cliff and terrace with bowlder pavement exposed at\r\nlow tide upon the shore at Scituate, Massachusetts.]\r\n\r\nThe edge of the cut and built terrace is, as already mentioned,\r\nmaintained at the depth of wave base. If one will study the submerged\r\ncontours of any of our inland lakes, it will be found that these\r\nbasins are surrounded by a gently sloping marginal shelf,—the cut and\r\nbuilt terrace,—and that the depth of this shelf at its outer edge is\r\nproportioned to the size of the lake. Upon Lake Mendota at Madison,\r\nWisconsin, the large storm waves have a length of about twenty feet,\r\nwhich is the depth of the outer edge of the shore terraces (Fig. 267,\r\np. 242). The shelf surrounding the continents has, with few local\r\nexceptions, a uniform depth of 100 fathoms, or about the wave base of\r\nthe heaviest storm waves.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The work of the shore current.=—In describing the formation of\r\nthe built terrace, it was stated that the greater part of the rock\r\nmaterial quarried upon headlands by the waves is diverted from the\r\noffshore terrace. This diversion is the work of the shore current\r\nproduced by the wave.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 259.—Map to show the nature of the shore current\r\nand the forms which are molded by it.]\r\n\r\nAt but few places upon a shore will the storm waves beat\r\nperpendicularly, and then for but short periods only. The broken wave,\r\nas it crawls ever more slowly up the beach, carries the sand with it in\r\na sweeping curve, and by the time gravity has put a stop to its forward\r\nmovement, it is directed for a brief instant parallel to the shore.\r\nSoon, however, the pull of gravity upon it has started the backward\r\njourney in a more direct course down the slope of the terrace; and\r\nhere encountering the next succeeding breaker, a portion of the water\r\nand the coarser sand particles with it are again carried forward for a\r\nrepetition of the zigzag journey. This many times interrupted movement\r\nof the sand particles may be observed during a high wind upon any sandy\r\nlee shore. The “set” of the water along the shore as a result of its\r\nzigzag journeyings is described as the _shore current_ (Fig. 259),\r\nand the effect upon sand distribution is the same as though a steady\r\ncurrent moved parallel to the shore in the direction of the average\r\ntrend of the moving particles.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The sand beach.=—The first effect of the shore current is to deposit\r\nsome portion of the sand within the first slight recess upon the shore\r\nin the lee of the cliff. The earlier deposits near the cliff gradually\r\nforce the shore current farther from the shore and so lay down a sand\r\nselvage to the shore, which is shaped in the form of an arc or crescent\r\nand known as a _beach_ (Fig. 259 and Fig. 260).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 260.—Crescent-shaped beach formed in the lee of\r\na headland. Santa Catalina Island, California (after a photograph by\r\nFairbanks).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 261.—Cross section of a beach pebble.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The shingle beach.=—With heavy storms and an exceptional reach of the\r\nwaves, the shore currents are competent to move, not the sand alone,\r\nbut pebbles, the area of whose broader surface may be as great as the\r\npalm of one’s hand. Such rock fragments are shaped by the continued\r\nwear against their neighbors under the restless breakers, until they\r\nhave a lenticular or watch-shaped form (Fig. 261). Such beach pebbles\r\nare described as _shingle_, and they are usually built up into distinct\r\nridges upon the shore, which, under the fury of the high breakers, may\r\nbe piled several feet above the level of quiet water (Fig. 262). Such\r\nstorm beaches have a gentle forward slope graded by the shore current,\r\nbut a steep backward slope on the angle of repose. Most storm beaches\r\nhave been largely shaped by the last great storm, such as comes only at\r\nintervals of a number of years.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 262.—Storm beach of coarse shingle about four feet in height\r\nat the base of Burnt Bluff on the northeast shore of Green Bay, Lake\r\nMichigan.]\r\n\r\n=Bar, spit, and barrier.=—Wherever the shore upon which a beach is\r\nbuilding makes a sudden landward turn at the entrance to a bay, the\r\nshore currents, by virtue of their inertia of motion, are unable longer\r\nto follow the shore. The débris which they carry is thus transported\r\ninto deeper water in a direction corresponding to a continuation of\r\nthe shore just before the point of turning (see Fig. 259, p. 238).\r\nThe result is the formation of a _bar_, which rises to near the\r\nwater surface and is extended across the entrance to the bay through\r\ncontinued growth at its end, after the manner of constructing a railway\r\nembankment across a valley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 263.—Spit of shingle on Au Train Island, Lake\r\nSuperior (after Gilbert).]\r\n\r\nOver the deeper water near the bar the waves are at first not generally\r\nhalted and broken, as they are upon the shore, and so the bar does not\r\nat once build itself to the surface, but remains an invisible bar to\r\nnavigation. From its shoreward end, however, the waves of even moderate\r\nstorms are broken, and the bar is there built above the water surface,\r\nwhere it appears as a narrow cape of sand or shingle which gradually\r\nthins in approaching its apex. This feature is the well-known _spit_\r\n(Fig. 263) which, as it grows across the entrance to the bay, becomes a\r\n_barrier_ or _barrier beach_ (Fig. 264).\r\n\r\nThe continuation of the visible in the usually invisible bar, is at the\r\ntime of high winds made strikingly apparent, for the wave base is below\r\nthe crest of the bar, and at such times its crescentic course beyond\r\nthe spit can be followed by the eye in a white arc of broken water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 264.—Barrier beach in front of a lagoon on Lake Mendota at\r\nMadison, Wisconsin. The shallow lagoon behind the barrier is filling up\r\nand is largely hidden in vegetation.]\r\n\r\nThe construction of a barrier across the entrance to a bay transforms\r\nthe latter into a separate body of water, a lagoon, within which\r\nsilting up and peat formation usually lead to an early extinction\r\n(p. 429). The formation of barriers thus tends to straighten out\r\nthe irregularities of coast lines, and opens the way to a natural\r\nenlargement of the land areas. While the coasts of the United Kingdom\r\nof Great Britain have been losing some four thousand acres through wave\r\nerosion, there has been a gain by growth in quiet lagoons which amounts\r\nto nearly seven times that amount. As evidence of the straightening\r\nof the shore line which results from this process, the coast of the\r\nCarolinas or of Nantucket (Fig. 459) may serve for illustration.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The land-tied island.=—We have seen that wave erosion operates to\r\nseparate small islands from the headlands, but the shore currents\r\ncounteract this loss to the continents by throwing out barriers which\r\njoin many separated islands to the mainland. Such land-tied islands are\r\na common feature on many rocky coasts, and upon the New England coast\r\nthey usually have been given the name of “neck.” The long arc of Lynn\r\nBeach joins the former island of Nahant, through its smaller neighbor\r\nLittle Nahant, to the coast of Massachusetts. A similar land-tied\r\nisland is Marblehead Neck. The Rock of Gibraltar, formerly an island,\r\nis now joined to Spain by the low beach known as the “neutral ground.”\r\nThe Spanish name, _tombola_, has sometimes been employed to describe an\r\nisland thus connected to the shore.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 265.—Cross section of a barrier beach with lagoon\r\nin its rear.]\r\n\r\n=A barrier series.=—The cross section of a barrier beach, like that of\r\na storm beach upon the shore, slopes gently upon the forward side, and\r\nmore steeply at the angle, of repose upon the rear or landward margin\r\n(Fig. 265). The thinning wedge of shore deposits which the barrier\r\nthrows out to seaward raises the level of the lake bottom (Fig. 266),\r\nand when coast irregularities are favorable to it, new spits will\r\ndevelop upon the shore outside the earlier one, and a new bar, and in\r\nits turn a barrier, will be found outside the initial one, taking a\r\ncourse in a direction more or less parallel to it (Fig. 267).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 266.—Cross section of a series of barriers and an\r\nouter bar.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 267.—Formation of barrier series and an outer bar in University\r\nBay of Lake Mendota, at Madison, Wisconsin. The water contour interval\r\nis five feet, and the land contour interval ten feet (based on a map by\r\nthe Wisconsin Geological Survey).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 268.—Series of barriers at the western end of Lake\r\nSuperior (after Gilbert).]\r\n\r\nSo soon as the first barrier is formed, processes are set in operation\r\nwhich tend to transform the newly formed lagoon into land, and so with\r\na series of barriers, a zone of water lilies between the outer barrier\r\nand the bar, a bog, and a land platform may represent the successive\r\nstages in this acquisition of territory by the lands. A noteworthy\r\nexample of barrier series and extension of the land behind them, is\r\nafforded by the bay at the western end of Lake Superior (Fig. 268).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 269.—Character profiles resulting from wave action\r\nupon shores.]\r\n\r\n=Character profiles.=—The character profiles yielded by the work of\r\nwaves are easy of recognition (Fig. 269). The vertical cliff with notch\r\nat its base is varied by the stack of sugar-loaf form carved in softer\r\nrocks, or the steeper notched variety cut from harder masses. Sea caves\r\nand sea arches yield variations of a curve common to the undercut\r\nforms. Wherever the materials of the shore are loosely consolidated\r\nonly, the sloping cliff is formed at the angle of repose of the\r\nmaterials. The barrier beach, though projecting but a short distance\r\nabove the waves, shows an unsymmetrical curve of cross section with the\r\nsteeper slope toward the land.\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING REFERENCES FOR CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n G.

Of these the more significant are\r\nthe notched rock cliff, the cut rock terrace, the sea cave, the sea\r\narch, the stack, and the sloping cliff and terrace, among the carved\r\nfeatures; and the barrier beach and built terrace, among the molded\r\nforms. It is important to remember that the molded forms, by the very\r\nmanner of their formation, stand in a definite relationship to the\r\ncarved features; so that when either one has been in part effaced and\r\nmade difficult of determination, the discovery of the other in its\r\ncorrect natural position may remove all doubt as to the origin of the\r\nrelic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 270.—The east coast of Florida, with shore line characteristic of\r\na raised coast.]\r\n\r\nIn studies of the change of level of the land, it is customary to refer\r\nall variations to the sea level as a zero plane of reference. It is not\r\non this account necessary to assume that the changes measured from this\r\narbitrary datum plane are the absolute upward or downward oscillations\r\nwhich would be measured from the earth’s center; for the sea, like the\r\nland, has been subject to its changes of level. There need, however, be\r\nno apology for the use of the sea surface as a plane of reference; for\r\nit is all that we have available for the purpose, and the changes in\r\nlevel, even if relative only, are of the greatest significance. It is\r\nprobable that in most cases where the coast line is rising from uplift,\r\nsome portion of the sea basin not far distant is becoming deepened,\r\nso that the visible change of level is the algebraic sum of the two\r\neffects.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Even coast line the mark of uplift.=—It was early pointed out in\r\nthis volume (p. 158) that the floor of the sea in the neighborhood of\r\nthe land presents a relatively even surface. The carving by waves,\r\ncombined with the process of deposition of sediments, tends to fill up\r\nthe minor irregularities of surface and preserve only the features of\r\nlarger scale, and these in much softened outlines. Upon the continents,\r\non the contrary, the running water, taking advantage of every slight\r\ndifference in elevation and searching out the hidden structure planes\r\nwithin the rock, soon etches out a surface of the most intricate\r\ndetail. The effect of elevation of the sea floor into the light of day\r\nwill therefore be to produce an even shore line devoid of harbors (Fig.\r\n270). If the coast has risen along visible planes of faulting near the\r\nsea margin, the coast line, in addition to being even, will usually be\r\nmade up of notably straight elements joined to one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 271.—Ragged coast line of Alaska, the effect of subsidence.]\r\n\r\n=A ragged coast line the mark of subsidence.=—When in place of uplift\r\na subsidence occurs upon the coast, the intricately etched surface,\r\nresulting from erosion beneath the sky, comes to be invaded by the sea\r\nalong each trench and furrow, so that a most ragged outline is the\r\nresult (Fig. 271). Such a coast has many harbors, while the uplifted\r\ncoast is as remarkable for its lack of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Slow uplift of the coast—the coastal plain and cuesta.=—A gradual\r\nuplift of the coast is made apparent in a progressive retirement of the\r\nsea across a portion of its floor, thus exposing this even surface of\r\nrecent sediments. The former shore land will be easily recognized by\r\nit’s etched surface, which will now come into sharp contrast with the\r\nnew plain. It is therefore referred to as the _oldland_ and the newly\r\nexposed _coastal plain_ as the _newland_ (Fig. 272).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 272.—Portion of Atlantic coastal plain and neighboring oldland of\r\nthe Appalachian Mountains.]\r\n\r\nBut the near-shore deposits upon the sea floor had an initial dip\r\nor slope to seaward, and this inclination has been increased in the\r\nprocess of uplift. The streams from the oldland have trenched their way\r\nacross these deposits while the shore was rising. But the process being\r\na slow one, deposits have formed upon the seaward side of the plain\r\nafter the landward portion was above tide, and the coastal plain may\r\ncome to have a “belted” or zoned character. The streams tributary to\r\nthose larger ones which have trenched the plain may encounter in turn\r\nharder and softer layers of the plain deposits, and at each hard layer\r\nwill be deflected along its margin so as to enter the main streams\r\nmore nearly at right angles. They will also, as time goes on, migrate\r\nlaterally seaward through undermining of the harder layers, and thus\r\nwill be shaped alternating belts of lowland separated by escarpments\r\nin the harder rock from the residual higher slopes. Belts of upland of\r\nthis character upon a coastal plain are called _cuestas_ (Fig. 273).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 273.—Ideal form of cuestas and intermediate lowlands carved from\r\na coastal plain (after Davis).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The sudden uplifts of the coasts.=—Elevations of the coast which\r\nyield the coastal plain must be accounted among the slower earth\r\nmovements that result in changes of level. Such movements, instead of\r\nbeing accompanied by disastrous earthquakes, were probably marked by\r\nfrequent slight shocks only, by subterranean rumblings, or, it may be,\r\nthe land rose gradually without manifestations of a sensible character.\r\n\r\nUpon those coasts which are often in the throes of seismic disturbance,\r\na quite different effect is to be observed. Here within the rocks\r\nwe will probably find the marks of recent faulting with large\r\ndisplacements, and the movements have been upon such a scale that shore\r\nfeatures, little modified by subsequent weathering, stand well above\r\nthe present level of the seas. Above such coasts, then, we recognize\r\nthe characteristic marks of wave action, and the evidence that they\r\nhave been suddenly uplifted is beyond question.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 274.—Uplifted sea cave, ten feet above the water\r\nupon the coast of California; the monument to a former earthquake\r\n(after a photograph by Fairbanks).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 275.—Double-notched cliff near Cape Tiro, Celebes\r\n(after a photograph by Sarasin).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The upraised cliff.=—Upon the coast of southern California may be\r\nfound all the features of wave-cut shores now in perfect preservation,\r\nand in some cases as much as fifteen hundred feet above the level of\r\nthe sea. These features are monuments to the grandest of earthquake\r\ndisturbances which in recent time have visited the region (Fig.\r\n274). Quite as striking an example of similar movements is afforded\r\nby notched cliffs in hard limestone upon the shore of the Island of\r\nCelebes (Fig. 275). But the coast of California furnishes the other\r\ncharacteristic coast features in the high sea arch and the stack\r\nas additional monuments to the recent uplift. Let one but imagine\r\nthe stacks which now form the Seal Rocks off the Cliff House at San\r\nFrancisco to be suddenly raised high above the sea, and the forms which\r\nthey would then present would differ but little from those which are\r\nshown in Fig. 276.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 276.—Jasper rock stacks uplifted on the coast of\r\nCalifornia (after a photograph by Fairbanks).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The uplifted barrier beach.=—Within the reëntrants of the shore, the\r\nwave-cut cliff is, as we know, replaced by the barrier beach, which\r\ntakes its course across the entrance to a bay. After an uplift, such\r\na barrier composed of sand or shingle should be connected with the\r\nheadlands, often with a partially filled lagoon behind it. Its cross\r\nsection should be steep in the direction of the lagoon, but quite\r\ngradual in front (Fig. 277).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 277.—Uplifted shingle beach across the entrance to\r\na former bay upon the coast of southern California (after a photograph\r\nby Fairbanks).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 278.—Raised beach terraces near Elie, Fife,\r\nScotland.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Coast terraces.=—Upon those shores where to-day high mountains\r\nfront the sea, the coast may generally be seen to rise in a series of\r\nterraces (Fig. 278). This is notably true of those coasts which are\r\nto-day racked by earthquakes, such as is the eastern margin of the\r\nPacific from Alaska to Patagonia. The traveler by steamer along the\r\ncoast from San Francisco to Chili has for weeks almost constantly in\r\nsight these giant steps on which the mountains have been uplifted from\r\nthe sea. In Alaska we are fortunate in having the history of the later\r\nstages in this uplift (Fig. 279). As described in a former chapter,\r\nportions of this shore rose in the month of September of the year 1899\r\nin some places as high as forty-seven feet, to the accompaniment of\r\na terrific earthquake and sea wave. Above the terrace which marks\r\nthe beach line of 1899 there is a higher terrace of similar form now\r\novergrown with trees, but none the less clearly to be recognized as a\r\nshore line of the past century which preceded in the long sequence the\r\nuplift of 1899.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 279.—Uplifted sea cliffs and terraces on the coast\r\nof Russell Fjord, Alaska (after Tarr and Martin).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 280.—Diagrams to show how excessive sinking\r\nupon the sea floor will cause the shore to migrate landward as it is\r\nuplifted.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 281.—A drowned river mouth, or estuary upon a coastal plain.]\r\n\r\nAs was noted in our study of earthquakes, the recent instrumental\r\nrecords of distant earthquakes tell us that the movements upon the sea\r\nfloor are many times larger than those upon the continents, and that\r\nwhile the mountainous coasts are generally rising, the deeps of the sea\r\nare sinking. The effect of this over-balance of sinking, or resultant\r\nshrinking of the earth’s shell, may be to compress the mountain\r\ndistrict and so cause the shore line to move landward at the same time\r\nthat it moves upward (Fig. 280).\r\n\r\n\r\n=The sunk or embayed coast.=—When now, upon the other hand, a section\r\nof the coast line sinks with reference to the sea, the water invades\r\nall the near-shore valleys, thus “drowning” them and yielding the\r\ndrowned river mouth or _estuary_. If the relief of the shore was\r\nslight, as it generally is upon a coastal plain, slight depression only\r\nwill produce broad estuaries, such as Chesapeake Bay at the drowned\r\nmouth of the Susquehanna (Fig. 281).\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the relief of the shore is strong and the\r\nsubsidence is large, the entire coast line will be transformed into\r\nan archipelago of steep-walled rocky islets which rise abruptly from\r\nthe sea (Figs. 282 and 284). A plateau which is intersected by deep\r\nand steep-walled valleys of U-section (p. 341) under large submergence\r\nyields the _fjords_ so characteristic of Scandinavia or Alaska. A\r\nragged coast line, fringed with islands as a result of submergence, is\r\ndescribed as an _embayed coast_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 282.—Archipelago of steep rocky islets due to large submergence\r\nof a coast having strong relief. Entrance to Esquimalt Harbor,\r\nVancouver Island (after a photograph by Fairbanks).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 283.—The submerged Hudsonian channel which continues the Hudson\r\nRiver across the continental shelf.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Submerged river channels.=—The sinking of a coast of small relief be\r\nsufficient to completely submerge river valleys, whose channels then\r\nbegin to fill with sediment and whose courses can only be followed in\r\nsoundings. One of the most interesting of such channels is that which\r\ncontinues the Hudson River across the continental shelf into the deeper\r\nsea (Fig. 283).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Records of an oscillation of movement.=—Because a coast is deeply\r\nembayed is no ground for assuming that a subsidence is now in progress,\r\nor is, in fact, the latest movement recorded upon the coast. In many\r\ncases it is easy to see that such is not the case. The coast of Maine\r\nis perhaps as typical of an embayed shore line as any that might be\r\ncited, but a study of the river valleys in the neighborhood shows\r\nclearly that the present submergence of their mouths is a fraction only\r\nof an earlier one which has left a record of its existence in beds of\r\nmarine clay which outline the earlier and far deeper indentations (Fig.\r\n284).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 284.—Marine clay deposits near the mouths of the rivers of Maine\r\nwhich preserve a record of earlier subsidence (after Stone).]\r\n\r\nIf now we give a closer examination to the coast, it is found that\r\nthere are marks of recent uplift in an abandoned shore line now far\r\nabove the reach of the waves. There is here, then, the record, first of\r\nsubsidence and consequent embayment, and, later, of an uplift which has\r\nreduced the raggedness of the coast outline exposed the clay deposits,\r\nand raised the strands of the period of deep subsidence to their\r\npresent position.\r\n\r\nIn countries which possess a more ancient civilization than our\r\nown, the record of such oscillations in the level of the ground has\r\nsometimes been entered upon human monuments, so that it is possible to\r\ndate more or less definitely the periods of subsidence or elevation. At\r\nthe little town of Pozzuoli, upon the shore of the Bay of Naples, is\r\nfound one of the mos instructive of these records.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 285.—View of the three standing columns of the temple of Jupiter\r\nSerapis at Pozzuoli, showing the dark and rough band nine feet in width\r\naffected by the rock-boring mollusks which now live in the Bay of\r\nNaples.]\r\n\r\nIn the ruins of the ancient temple of Jupiter Serapis are three marble\r\nmonoliths 40 feet in height, curiously marked by a roughened surface\r\nbetween the heights of 12 and 21 feet above their pedestals (Fig. 285).\r\nCloser inspection shows that this roughened surface has been produced\r\nby a marine, rock-boring mollusk, the _lithodomus_, which lives in\r\nthe waters of the Bay of Naples, and the shells of this animal are\r\nstill to be found within the cavities upon the surface of the columns.\r\nWithout recounting details which have been many times recited since\r\nthese interesting monuments were first geologically explored by Babbage\r\nand Lyell, it may be stated that a record is here preserved, first of\r\nsubsidence amounting to some 40 feet, and of subsequent elevation, of\r\nthe low coast land on which stood the temple in the old Roman city of\r\nPuteoli (Fig. 286).\r\n\r\nAt the time of deepest submergence the top of the lithodomus zone\r\nupon the column stood at the level of the water in the Bay of Naples,\r\nthe smoother lower zone being buried at the time in the sand at the\r\nbottom, and thus made inaccessible for the lithodomi. It is to be added\r\nthat studies made in the environs of Pozzuoli have fully confirmed\r\nthe changes of level revealed by the columns, through the discovery\r\nof now elevated shore lines which are referable to the period of deep\r\nsubmergence.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Simultaneous contrary movements upon a coast.=—In our study of\r\nthe changes in the level of the ground that take place during\r\nearthquakes, it was learned that neighboring sections of the earth’s\r\ncrust may be moved at different rates or even in opposite directions,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that the general movement of the province is\r\none of uplift. Thus during the Alaskan earthquake of 1899, although\r\nportions of the coast line were elevated by as much as forty-seven\r\nfeet, neighboring sections were raised by smaller amounts, and some\r\nsmall sections were sunk and so far submerged that the salt water and\r\nthe beach sand were washed about the roots of forest trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 286.—Pozzuoli in the 3rd, 9th, and 20th\r\nCenturies.]\r\n\r\nA region racked by heavy earthquakes, where the present configuration\r\nof the ground speaks strongly for a movement of somewhat similar\r\nnature, but with average movement of elevation much greater to the\r\nnorthward than in the opposite direction, is the extended coast line\r\nof Chili. This country is characterized by a great central north and\r\nsouth valley which separates the coast range from the high chain of the\r\nCordilleras to the eastward. To the southward the floor of this valley\r\ndescends, and has its continuance in the Gulf of Corcovado behind the\r\nisland of Chiloe and the Chonos archipelago. The known recent uplift of\r\nthe coast of Chili, particularly in the northern sections and during\r\nthe earthquakes of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries,\r\nlends great interest to this topographic peculiarity. Indications are\r\nnot lacking that, during the earthquake of Concepcion in 1835, and of\r\nValparaiso in 1907, the measure of uplift was greater to the north than\r\nit was to the south.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 287.—Map of San Clemente Island, California,\r\nshowing the characteristic topography of recent uplift (after U. S.\r\nCoast and Geodetic Survey).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The contrasted islands of San Clemente and Santa Catalina.=—Perhaps\r\nthe most striking example of simultaneous opposite movements observable\r\nin neighboring portions of the earth’s crust is furnished by the coast\r\nof southern California. The coast itself at San Pedro and the island\r\nof San Clemente, some fifty miles off this point, in common with most\r\nportions of the neighboring coast land, have been rising in interrupted\r\nmovements from the sea, and offer in rare perfection the characteristic\r\ncoast terraces (Fig. 287 and Fig. 278, p. 250). Midway between these\r\ntwo rising sections of the crust, and less than twenty-five miles\r\ndistant from either, is the island of Santa Catalina, which has been\r\nsinking beneath the waves, and apparently at a similarly rapid rate\r\n(Fig. 288). The topography of the island shows the intricate detail of\r\na maturely eroded surface, while that of the neighboring San Clemente\r\nshows only the widely spaced, deep cañons of the infantile stage of\r\nerosion (Fig. 165 and pl. 12 A). While Santa Catalina has been sinking,\r\nSan Pedro Hill has risen 1240 feet, and San Clemente, 1500 feet. It\r\nis characteristic of a sinking coast line that the cliff recession is\r\nabnormally rapid, and evidence for this is furnished by the shores of\r\nSanta Catalina, upon which the waves are cutting the cliffs back into\r\nthe beds of cañons, and so causing small falls to develop at the cañon\r\nmouths.\r\n\r\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n│   PLATE 12.                                                         │\r\n│                                                                     │\r\n│ [Illustration: _A._ V-shaped cañon cut in an upland recently        │\r\n│ elevated from the sea, San Clemente Island, California (after W.

S. C. and G. S.).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Blue Grotto of Capri.=—We may now return to the Bay of Naples for\r\nadditional evidence that oscillations of level in neighboring portions\r\nof the same coast are not necessarily synchronous, and that near-lying\r\nsections may even move in opposite directions at the same time, as has\r\nalready been shown for the islands off the California coast. For the\r\nPozzuoli shore of the bay it was learned that within the Christian\r\nEra a complete cycle of downward, followed by later upward, movement\r\nhas been largely accomplished. Across the bay, and less than 20 miles\r\ndistant, is the Blue Grotto of Capri, a sea cave cut in limestone above\r\nan earlier cave of the same nature which is now deep below the water\r\nsurface. It is the refracted sunlight which enters the cave through\r\nthis lower submerged opening and has been robbed on the way of all but\r\nits blue rays which gives to the famous grotto its special charm (Fig.\r\n289).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 289.—Cross section of the Blue Grotto on the Island of Capri,\r\nshowing the submerged sea cave through which most of the light enters\r\nthe grotto, and the higher artificial window now widened by wave action\r\n(after von Knebel).]\r\n\r\nIt is known that the former, and now submerged, sea cave was in use\r\nby Roman patricians as a cool retreat from the oppressive hot wind\r\nknown as the sirocco, and that an artificial entrance or window was\r\ncut where is now the only accessible entrance to the grotto. In the\r\nancient writings, no mention is made, however, of the remarkable blue\r\nillumination for which it is now famous, and the conditions at the\r\ntime, as we may see, were not such as to make this possible. Later\r\nsubsidence of the coast has brought the ancient window to the sea\r\nlevel, where it has been considerably enlarged by the waves. The\r\nearlier grotto, abandoned as its entrance was closed, was rediscovered\r\nin 1826 by the painter and poet, August Kopisch.\r\n\r\nA grotto with green illumination (the Grotto Verde) is situated upon\r\nthe opposite side of the island, and a blue grotto, having its origin\r\nin similar conditions to those of the famous Blue Grotto, is found upon\r\nthe island of Busi off the Dalmatian coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Character profiles.=—In the landscape of a coast which has been\r\nslowly uplifted the characteristic line is the profile of the cuesta,\r\nwith short perpendicular element joined to a gently sloping and longer\r\nsection and continued in the horizontal portion corresponding to the\r\nlowland (Fig. 290). Rapidly uplifted coasts offer in contrast the\r\nlines characteristic of wave erosion and deposition, but at higher\r\nlevels and in repeated sections. Most prominent of all is the staircase\r\nconstructed of coast terraces, with either vertical or sloping risers\r\nand with outwardly inclining and gently graded treads. Near the steep\r\nriser in the staircase may sometimes be seen the sugar-loaf outline of\r\nthe stack cut in softer material, or the obelisk-like pillar undercut\r\nat its base, which is carved in firmer rock masses. With excessively\r\nrapid uplift, the double-notched cliff or the double sea arch may\r\nappear in the landscape. Upon a submerged coast the most significant\r\nlines in the view are those of the rock islet and the steep-walled\r\nfjord.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 290.—Character profiles in coast landscapes where\r\nthere has been either elevation or depression.]\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING REFERENCES FOR CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n General:—\r\n\r\n SIR CH.

Eventually so much snow will have\r\naccumulated that under its own weight and in obedience to its peculiar\r\nproperties, a movement will begin within the mass tending to spread\r\nit and so to reduce the slope of its upper surface (Frontispiece\r\nplate). The conditions favorable to glaciation are, therefore, heavy\r\nprecipitation and low annual temperature. If the precipitation is\r\nscanty, the small snowfall is soon melted; and if the temperature be\r\ntoo high, the moisture is precipitated not in the form of snow but as\r\nrain. It is important here to keep in mind that snow is a poor heat\r\nconductor and itself protects its deeper layers from melting.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The snow-line.=—Because of the low temperatures glaciers should\r\nbe most abundant or most extensive in high latitudes and in high\r\naltitudes. The largest are found in polar and subpolar regions, and\r\nthey are elsewhere encountered only at considerable elevations.\r\nThe largest glaciers are the vast sheets of ice which inwrap the\r\ncontinents of Greenland and Antarctica, but glaciers of large size\r\nare to be found upon other large land masses of the Arctic, as well\r\nas in Alaska, in the southern Andes, and in New Zealand. Much smaller\r\nglaciers are characteristic of certain highlands within temperate and\r\ntropical regions, but because of specially favorable conditions both of\r\naltitude and precipitation the Himalayas, although in relatively low\r\nlatitudes, nourish glaciers of large proportions. In general, it may\r\nbe said that the nourishing grounds of glaciers are largely restricted\r\nto those areas where snow covers the ground throughout the year. The\r\nlower margin of such areas is designated the _snow line_, and varies\r\nbut little from the line on which the average summer temperature is at\r\nthe freezing point of water—the so-called _summer isotherm of 32°\r\nFahrenheit_. Within the tropics this line may rise as high as 18,000\r\nfeet above the sea, whereas in polar latitudes it descends to sea level.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Importance of mountain barriers in initiating glaciers.=—The\r\nprecipitation within any district depends, however, not alone upon the\r\namount of moisture which is brought to it in the clouds, but upon the\r\namount which is abstracted before the clouds have passed over it. The\r\ncapacity of space to hold moisture increases with its temperature, and\r\nhence any lowering of this temperature will reduce the capacity. If\r\nlowered sufficiently, the point of complete saturation will be reached\r\nand further cooling must result in precipitation. Hence, anything which\r\nforces an air current to rise into more rarefied zones above, will\r\nlower the pressure upon it and so bring about a cooling effect in which\r\nno heat is abstracted. This so-called _adiabatic refrigeration_ of a\r\ngas may be illustrated by the cool current which issues in a jet from\r\na warm expanded rubber tire after the cock has been opened; or even\r\nbetter, by the instant solidification at extreme low temperatures of\r\nsuch normal gases as carbonic acid when they are allowed to issue under\r\nheavy pressure from a small orifice.\r\n\r\nAs applied to moisture-laden and near-surface winds, the effective\r\nagents of adiabatic cooling are the upland areas upon the continents,\r\nand especially the ranges of mountains. These barriers force the moving\r\nclouds to rise, cool, and deposit their moisture. It is, therefore, the\r\nhighland barriers which face the oncoming, moisture-laden winds that\r\nreceive the heaviest precipitation. Within temperate regions, because\r\nof the prevalence of westerly winds, those barriers which face the\r\nwestern shores receive the heaviest fall. Within the tropics, on the\r\nother hand, it is the barriers facing the eastern shores which, because\r\nof the easterly “trades”, are most favorable to precipitation.\r\n\r\nThus it is in the Sierra Nevadas of California, and not in the Rockies\r\nor the Appalachians, that the glaciers of the United States are found.\r\nThe highland of the Swiss Alps lying likewise athwart the “westerlies”\r\nof the temperate zone acquires the moisture for nourishment of its\r\nglaciers from the western ocean—here the Atlantic (Fig. 291). Within\r\nthe tropics the conditions are reversed, and it is in general the\r\nranges which lie nearer the eastern coasts that are the more favored.\r\nIf no barrier is found upon this coast, the clouds may travel over\r\nvast stretches of country before being arrested by mountains and robbed\r\nof their moisture. Thus in tropical Brazil the glaciers are found in\r\nthe Andes upon the Pacific coast though nourished by clouds from the\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 291.—Map showing the distribution of existing\r\nglaciers, and the two important wind poles of the earth.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sensitiveness of glaciers to temperature changes.=—How sensitive\r\nis the adjustment between snow precipitation and temperature may be\r\nstrikingly illustrated by the statement on excellent authority that if\r\nthe average annual temperature of the air within the Scottish Highlands\r\nshould be lowered by only three degrees Fahrenheit, small glaciers\r\nwould be the result; and a moderate temperature fall within the region\r\nsurrounding the Laurentian lakes of North America would bring on\r\nglaciation, otherwise expressed as a depression of the snow line of the\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The cycle of glaciation.=—Though to-day buried beneath its ice\r\nmantle, it is known that Greenland had more than once in earlier\r\ngeological ages a notably mild climate, and in some future age it may\r\nrevert to this condition. In other regions, also, we have evidence\r\nthat such a rotation of climatic changes has been successively\r\naccomplished, the climate having steadily increased in severity towards\r\na culminating point, and been followed by a reverse series of changes.\r\nSuch a complete period may be called a _cycle of glaciation_. While\r\nthe climate is steadily becoming more rigorous, we have to do with\r\nan _advancing hemicycle_ of glaciation, but after the culminating\r\npoint has been reached, the period of amelioration of climate is the\r\n_receding hemicycle_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The advancing hemicycle.=—There is little reason to doubt that\r\nwhatever be the cause of the climatic changes which bring on glacial\r\nconditions, these changes come on by insensible gradations. The\r\nfirst visible evidence of the increased severity of the climate is\r\nthe longer persistence of the winter snows, at first within the more\r\nelevated districts. In such positions drifts must eventually continue\r\nthroughout the warm season and so contribute to the snow accumulations\r\nof the succeeding winter. This point once reached, small glaciers are\r\ninevitable, even should the average temperature fall no further, for\r\nthe snow left over in each season must steadily increase the depth of\r\nthe deposits until the weight brings about an internal motion of the\r\nmass from higher to lower levels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 292.—An Alaskan glacier spreading out at the foot\r\nof the range which nourishes it.]\r\n\r\nThe inherited depressions of the upland—the gentle hollows at the\r\nheads of rivers—will first be filled, and so the valleys below become\r\nthe natural channels for the outflow of the early glaciers. With a\r\ncontinued lowering of the annual temperature and consequent increased\r\nsnowfall, the early glaciers become more and more amply nourished. Snow\r\nand ice will, therefore, cover larger areas of the upland, and the\r\nglaciers will push their fronts farther down the valleys before they\r\nare wasted in the warm air of the lower levels. As the valleys become\r\nthus more completely invested by the glacier they are likewise filled\r\nto greater and greater depths, and they may thus submerge portions of\r\nthe walls that separate adjacent valleys. Reaching at last the front\r\nof the upland area, the glaciers may now be so well nourished at\r\ntheir heads that they push out upon the flatter foreland and without\r\nrestraint from retaining walls spread broadly upon it (Fig. 292).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 293.—Surface of a glacier whose upper layers\r\nspread with slight restraint from retaining walls. Surface of the\r\nFolgefond, an ice cap of southern Norway.]\r\n\r\nThe culmination of the progressive climatic change may ere this have\r\nbeen reached and milder conditions have ensued. If, however, the\r\nseverity of the climate should be still further increased, the expanded\r\nfronts of neighboring glaciers will coalesce to form a common ice fan\r\nor apron along the foot of the upland (Plate 18 B). This could hardly\r\ntake place without a still further deepening of the ice within the\r\nvalleys above, and, probably, a progressive submergence of the lower\r\ncrests in the valley walls. This may even continue until all parts of\r\nthe upland area have been buried. The snow and ice now take the form\r\nof a covering cap or carapace, and the upper portions being no longer\r\nrestrained at the sides, now spread into a broad dome, as would a\r\nviscous liquid like thick molasses when poured out upon the floor (Fig.\r\n293). The lower zones of the mass and the thinner marginal portions\r\nstill have their motion to a greater or less extent controlled by the\r\nirregularity of the rock floor against which they rest.\r\n\r\nThe reverse series of changes in the glacier is inaugurated by an\r\namelioration of the climate, and here, therefore, the advancing\r\nhemicycle becomes merged in the receding hemicycle of glaciation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Continental and mountain glaciers contrasted.=—The time when the\r\nrock surface becomes submerged beneath the glacier is, as regards\r\nboth the surface forms and the erosive work, a critical point of much\r\nsignificance; for the ice cap and larger continental glacier obviously\r\nprotect the rock surface from the action of those chemical and\r\nmechanical processes in which the atmosphere enters as chief agent, and\r\nwhich are collectively known as weathering processes. Until submergence\r\nis accomplished, larger or smaller portions of the rock surface project\r\neither through or between the ice masses and are, therefore, exposed to\r\ndirect attack by the weather (see below, p. 370).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 294.—Section through a mountain glacier (in solid\r\nblack), showing how its surface is determined by the irregularities in\r\nthe rock basement (after Hess).]\r\n\r\nSnow which falls in the mountains is not allowed to remain long where\r\nit falls. By the first high wind it is swept off the more elevated and\r\nexposed surfaces and collected under eddies in any existing hollows,\r\nbut especially those upon the lee slopes of the range. We are to learn\r\nthat glaciers carve the mountains by enlarging the hollows which they\r\nfind and producing great basins for the collection of their snows; but\r\nwith the initiation of glaciation the inherited hollows are in most\r\ncases the unimportant depressions at the heads of streams. Whatever\r\nthey may be and however formed, the snow first fills those hollows\r\nwhich are sheltered from the wind, and as it accumulates and becomes\r\ndistributed as ice, assumes a surface of its own that is dependent upon\r\nthe form and the position of the basin which it occupies (see Fig. 294).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 295.—Profile across the largest of the Icelandic\r\nice caps, with the vertical scale greatly exaggerated (after Thoroddsen\r\nand Spethmann).]\r\n\r\nWhen the quantity of accumulated snow is so great that all hollows of\r\nthe rock surface are filled, its own surface is no longer controlled\r\nby retaining rock walls, and it now assumes a form largely independent\r\nof the irregularities in the upland. Experience shows that this surface\r\nis approximately that of a flat dome or shield, and as it covers all\r\nthe upland, save where the ice thins upon its margins, this type of\r\nglacier is called an _ice cap_ (Fig. 295). All types of glacier in\r\nwhich rock projects above the highest levels of the ice and snow are\r\nknown as _mountain glaciers_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 296.—Ideal section across a continental glacier,\r\nwith the vertical scale and the projecting rock masses of the marginal\r\nzone greatly magnified.]\r\n\r\nThe flat domes of ice which mantle the continents of Greenland and\r\nAntarctica, though resembling in form the smaller ice cap, are yet\r\nbecause of their vast size so distinct from them, particularly in the\r\nmanner of their nourishment, that they belong in a separate class\r\ndescribed as _inland ice_ or _continental glaciers_. Though they have\r\nsome affinities with ice caps, they are most sharply differentiated\r\nfrom all types of mountain glaciers. Of them it is true that the\r\nlithosphere projects through them only in the neighborhood of their\r\nmargins (Fig. 296), whereas in the case of mountain glaciers rock may\r\nproject at any level but _always above the highest snow surface_. Ice\r\ncaps may be regarded as intermediate between the two main classes of\r\nmountain and continental glaciers (Fig. 297). Because of the large rôle\r\nwhich continental glaciers have played in geological history, it is\r\nthought best to consider them first, leaving for later discussion the\r\nno less interesting but less important mountain glaciers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 297.—View of the Eyriks-Jökull, an ice-cap of\r\nIceland (after Grossman).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The nourishment of glaciers.=—The life of a glacier is dependent upon\r\nthe continued deposition of snow in aggregate amount in excess of that\r\nwhich is lost by melting or by other depleting processes. Whenever, on\r\nthe other hand, the waste exceeds the precipitation, the glacier is in\r\na receding condition and must eventually disappear, if such conditions\r\nare sufficiently long continued. The source of the snow is the water\r\nof the ocean evaporated into the atmosphere and transported over the\r\nland in the form of clouds. We are to learn that the changes which\r\nthis moisture undergoes before its delivery to the glacier are notably\r\ndifferent for the classes of continental and mountain glacier.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The upper and lower cloud zones of the atmosphere.=—Before we can\r\ncomprehend the nature of the processes by which glaciers are nourished,\r\nit will be necessary to review the results of recent studies made upon\r\nthe earth’s atmospheric envelope. It must be kept in mind that the\r\nsun’s rays are chiefly effective in warming the atmosphere through\r\nbeing first absorbed by some solid body such as rock or water and\r\ntheir heat then communicated by contact to the immediately adjacent\r\nair layers. The layers thus warmed being now lighter than before,\r\nthey rise and are replaced by colder air, which in its turn is warmed\r\nand likewise set in upward motion. Such currents developed in the air\r\nby contact with warmer solid bodies constitute the process known as\r\nconvection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 298.—The zones of the lower atmosphere as revealed\r\nby recent kite and balloon explorations.]\r\n\r\nTo a relatively small degree the atmosphere is heated by the direct\r\nabsorption of the sun’s rays which pass through it. Since air has\r\nweight, it compresses the lower layers near the earth, and hence as we\r\nascend from the earth’s surface the air becomes continually lighter.\r\nConvection currents must, therefore, adjust themselves by the air\r\nexpanding as it rises. But expansion of a gas always results in its\r\ncooling, as every one must have observed who has placed his finger in\r\nthe air current which escapes from the open valve of a warm rubber\r\ntire. Dry air is cooled a degree Fahrenheit for every six hundred feet\r\nof ascent in the atmosphere. At a height of about seven miles above\r\nthe earth’s surface all rising air currents have cooled to about 68°\r\nbelow the zero of the Fahrenheit scale, and exploration with balloons\r\nhas shown that the currents rise no farther. At this level they move\r\nhorizontally, just as rising vapor spreads out in a room beneath the\r\nceiling. Above this level, as far as exploration has gone, or to a\r\nheight of more than twelve miles, the temperature remains nearly\r\nconstant, and this upper zone is, therefore, called the _isothermal_\r\nor the _advective zone_—the uniform temperature zone of the lower\r\natmosphere. Beneath the convective ceiling the process of convection is\r\ncharacteristic, and this zone is therefore described as the _convective\r\nzone_ (Fig. 298).\r\n\r\nA large part of the moisture which rises from the ocean’s surface is\r\ncondensed to vapor before it has ascended three miles, and in this form\r\nit makes its transit over land as fleecy or stratiform clouds—the\r\nso-called cumulus and stratus clouds and their many intermediate\r\nvarieties (see Frontispiece). This lower layer within the convective\r\nzone is, therefore, a moist one overlaid by a relatively drier middle\r\nlayer of the convective zone. That moisture which rises above the lower\r\ncloud layer is congealed by adiabatic cooling to fine ice needles\r\nvisible as the so-called cirrus clouds which float as feathery fronds\r\nbeneath the convective ceiling (see frontispiece at right upper corner\r\nof picture). Thus we have within the convective zone an upper layer\r\nmore or less charged with water in the form of ice needles. It is the\r\nclouds of the lower zone whose moisture in the form of vapor supplies\r\nthe nourishment of mountain glaciers, and the high cirrus clouds whose\r\ncongealed moisture, after interesting transformations, is responsible\r\nfor the continued existence of continental glaciers.\r\n\r\nAs we are to see, there are other noteworthy differences between\r\ncontinental and mountain glaciers, in the manner of their sculpture\r\nof the lithosphere, so that long after they have disappeared the\r\ncharacters of each are easily identified in their handiwork. How the\r\nlower clouds are forced upward and so compelled to give up their\r\nmoisture to feed the mountain glaciers, and how the upper clouds are\r\npulled downward to nourish the glaciers of continents, can be best\r\nunderstood after the characteristics of each glacier class have been\r\nstudied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE CONTINENTAL GLACIERS OF POLAR REGIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 299.—Map of Greenland showing the area of inland-ice and the\r\nroutes of different explorers.]\r\n\r\n=The inland ice of Greenland.=—In Greenland and in Antarctica the land\r\nis almost or quite buried under a cover of snow and ice—the so-called\r\n“inland ice”—which always assumes the surface of a very flat dome or\r\nshield. In Greenland there is found a marginal ribbon of land generally\r\nfrom five to twenty-five miles in width (Fig. 299), but in Antarctica\r\nall the land, with the exception of a few mountain peaks, is inwrapped\r\nin a mantle of ice which is also extended upon the sea in a broad shelf\r\nof snow and ice. Neither of these vast glaciers has been explored\r\nexcept in its marginal portion, yet such is the symmetry of the\r\nprofiles along the routes traversed, and such the flatness and monotony\r\nof the snow surface within the margins, that there is little reason to\r\ndoubt that the profile made along Nansen’s route in southern Greenland\r\nwould, save only for magnitude, fairly represent a section across the\r\nmiddle of the continent (Fig. 300).\r\n\r\n\r\n=The mountain rampart and its portals.=—As soon as we examine the\r\ncoastal belt we observe that the “Great Ice” of Greenland is held\r\nin by a wall of mountains and so prevented from spreading out to its\r\nnatural surface in the marginal portions. Through portals of the\r\ninclosing mountain ranges—the _outlets_—it sends out _tongues_ of ice\r\nwhich in many respects resemble certain types of mountain glaciers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 300.—Profile in natural proportions across the southern end of\r\nthe continental glacier of Greenland, constructed upon an arc of the\r\nearth’s surface and based upon Nansen’s profile corrected by Hess. The\r\nmarginal portions of the profile are represented below upon a magnified\r\nscale in order to bring out the characters of the marginal slopes.]\r\n\r\nSuch measurements as have been made upon the inland ice of Greenland\r\nat points back from, but yet comparatively near to, the outlets, show\r\nthat it has here a surface rate of motion amounting to less than an\r\ninch per day, and it is highly probable that at moderate distances from\r\nthe margin this amount diminishes to zero. Upon the outlets, on the\r\ncontrary, surface rates as high as 59 feet per day have been measured,\r\nand even 100 feet per day has been reported. We are thus justified in\r\nsaying that glacier flow within the outlets is from 700 to 1000 times\r\nas great as it is upon the near-by inland ice, and that the glacier\r\nis in a measure drained through the portals of the inclosing ranges.\r\nBack from these outlet streams of ice, or tongues, the surface of the\r\ninland ice is depressed to form a dimple or “basin of exudation” as is\r\nthe surface of a reservoir above the raceway when the water is being\r\nrapidly drawn away (Fig. 301).\r\n\r\n┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n│   PLATE 13.                                                        │\r\n│                                                                    │\r\n│ [Illustration: _A._ Precipitous front of the Bryant glacier outlet │\r\n│ of the Greenland inland-ice (after Chamberlin).]                   │\r\n│                                                                    │\r\n│ [Illustration: _B._ Lateral stream beside the Benedict glacier     │\r\n│ outlet, Greenland (after R.

Umanakfjord, Greenland (after von Drygalski).]\r\n\r\nFissures in the ice, the so-called crevasses, are the recognized\r\nmarks of ice movement, and these are always concentrated at the steep\r\nslopes of the ice surface in the neighborhood of its margins. Upon the\r\nGreenland ice, crevasses are restricted in their distribution to a zone\r\nwhich extends from seven to twenty-five miles within the ice border.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The marginal rock islands.=—From its margin the ice surface rises\r\nso steeply as to be climbed only with difficulty, but this gradient\r\nsteadily diminishes until at a distance of between seventy-five and\r\na hundred miles its slope is less than two degrees. Where crossed by\r\nNansen near latitude 64° N. the broad central area of ice was so nearly\r\nlevel as to appear to be a plain.\r\n\r\nAs we pass across the irregular ice margin in the direction of the\r\ninterior, larger and larger proportions of the land’s surface are\r\nsubmerged, until only projecting peaks rise above the ice as islands\r\nwhich are described as _nunataks_ (Fig. 302).\r\n\r\nThough not a universal observation, it has been often noted that the\r\nabsorption of the sun’s rays by rock masses projecting through the snow\r\nresults in a radiation of the heat and a lowering by melting of the\r\nsurrounding snow and ice. For this reason nunataks are often surrounded\r\nby a deep trench due to a melting of the snow. Such a depression in\r\nthe ice surface about the margin of a nunatak, from its resemblance to\r\na trench about an ancient castle, has been designated a _moat_ (Fig.\r\n303). For the same reason, the outlet tongues of ice which descend in\r\ndeep fjords between walls of rock are melted away from the walls and a\r\nlateral stream of water is sometimes found to flow between ice and rock\r\n(pl. 13 B).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 302.—Edge of the Greenland inland ice, showing the nunataks\r\ndiminishing in size toward the interior. The lines upon the ice are\r\nmedial moraines starting from nunataks (after Libbey).]\r\n\r\n=Rock fragments which travel with the ice.=—Rock surfaces which are\r\nexposed to the atmosphere are in high latitudes broken down through\r\nthe freezing of water within their crevices. The fragments resulting\r\nfrom this rending process fall upon the glacier surface and are carried\r\nforward as passengers in the direction of the ice margin. They are\r\neither visible as long and narrow ridges or trains following the\r\ndirections of the steepest slope (Fig. 302), or they become buried\r\nunder fresh falls of snow and only again become visible where summer\r\nmelting has lowered the glacier surface in the vicinity of its margin.\r\nThese longitudinal trains of rock fragments upon the glacier surface\r\nalways have their starting point at the lower margin of one of the\r\nnunataks, and are known as _medial moraines_ (Fig. 301, p. 273, and\r\nFig. 302). Inside the zone of nunataks the glacier surface is, however,\r\nclear of rock débris except where dust has been blown on by the wind,\r\nand this extends for a few miles only. The material of the medial\r\nmoraines is a collection of angular blocks whose surfaces are the\r\nresult of frost rending, for in their travel above the ice they are\r\nsubjected to no abrading processes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 303.—Moat surrounding a nunatak in Victoria Land\r\n(after Scott).]\r\n\r\nA contrasted type of surface moraines upon the Greenland glacier,\r\ninstead of being parallel to the direction of ice movement, is directed\r\ntransversely or parallel to the margins. The materials of these\r\nmoraines are more rounded fragments of rock which have come up from\r\nthe bottom layers, and we shall again refer to the origin of such\r\nmoraines after the subglacial conditions have been considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The grinding mill beneath the ice.=—If, now, we examine the front of\r\na glacier tongue which goes out from the inland ice, we find that while\r\nthe upper portion is white and mainly free from rock débris (plate\r\n13 A), the lower zone is of a dark color and crowded with layers of\r\npebbles and bowlders which have been planed, polished, and scratched in\r\na quite remarkable manner. The ice front is itself subject to forward\r\nand retrograde migrations of short period, but it is easily seen that\r\nin the main its larger movement has been a retrograde one. The ground\r\nfrom which it has lately withdrawn is generally a hard rock floor\r\nunweathered, but smooth, polished, and scratched in the same manner\r\nas the bowlders which are imbedded within the ice. It is perfectly\r\napparent that the latter have been derived from some portion of the\r\nrock basement upon which the glacier still rests, and that floor and\r\nbowlders have alike been ground smooth by mutual contact under pressure.\r\n\r\nThis erosion beneath the ice is accomplished by two processes; namely,\r\n_plucking_ and _abrasion_. Wherever the rock over which the glacier\r\nmoves has stood up in projecting masses and is riven by fissure planes\r\nof any kind, the ice has found it easy to remove it in larger or\r\nsmaller fragments by a quarrying process described as plucking. The\r\nrock may be said to be torn away in blocks which are largely bounded by\r\nthe preëxisting fissure planes. Over relatively even surfaces plucking\r\nhas little importance, but where there are noteworthy inequalities\r\nof surface upon the glacier bed, those sides which are away from the\r\noncoming ice (_lee_ side) are degraded by plucking in such a manner as\r\nsometimes to leave steep and ragged fracture surfaces. The tools of\r\nthe ice thus acquired in the process of plucking are quickly frozen\r\ninto the lowest ice layers, and being now dragged along the floor\r\nthey abrade in the same manner as does a rasp or file. These tools of\r\nthe ice are themselves worn away in the process and are thus given\r\ntheir characteristic shapes. Just as the lapidary grinds the surface\r\nof a jewel into facets by imbedding the gem in a matrix, first in one\r\nand then in another position, each time wearing down the projecting\r\nirregularities through contact with the abrading surface; so in like\r\nmanner the rock fragment is held fast at the bottom of the glacier\r\nuntil “soled” or “shod”, first upon one side and then upon another.\r\nAccidental contact with some obstruction upon the floor may suffice\r\nto turn the fragment and so expose a new surface to wear upon the\r\nabrading floor. Minor obstructions coming in contact with one side of\r\nthe fragment only, may turn it in its own plane without overturning.\r\nEvidence of such interruptions can be later read in the different\r\ndirections of striæ upon the same facet (plate 17 A).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n FIG. 304.—A glacier pavement of Permo-Carboniferous age in South\r\n Africa. The striæ running in the direction of the observer are\r\n prominent and a noteworthy gouging of the surface is to be noted to\r\n the right in the middle distance (after Davis).]\r\n\r\nThe floor beneath the glacier is reduced by the abrading process to a\r\nmore or less smooth and generally flattened or rounded surface—the\r\nso-called _glacier pavement_ (Fig. 304). To accomplish this all former\r\nmantle rock due to weathering processes must first be cleared away, and\r\nthe firm unaltered rock beneath is wherever susceptible of it given a\r\nsmooth polish although locally scored and scratched by the grinding\r\nbowlders. The earlier projections of the surface of the floor, if not\r\nentirely planed away, are at least transformed into rounded shoulders\r\nof rock, which from their resemblance to closely crowded backs in a\r\nflock of sheep have been called “sheep backs” or “_roches moutonnées_.”\r\nThus the effect of the combined action of the processes of plucking and\r\nabrasion is to reduce the accent of the relief and to mold the contours\r\nof the rock in smoothly flowing curves, generally of large radius.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The lifting of the grinding tools and their incorporation within the\r\nice.=—Wherever the ice is locally held in check by the projecting\r\nnunataks, relief is found between such obstructions, and there the flow\r\nof the ice has a correspondingly increased velocity (Fig. 305 _b_).\r\nIf the obstructions are not of large dimensions, the ice which flows\r\naround the outer edges is soon joined to that which passes between the\r\nobstructions and so normal conditions of flow are restored below the\r\nnunataks. The locally rapid flow of the ice is, therefore, restricted\r\nto a relatively short distance, the passageway between the nunataks,\r\nand the conditions are thus to be likened to the fall of water at a\r\nraceway due to the sudden descent of its surface from the level of\r\nthe reservoir to the level of the stream in the outlet. As is well\r\nknown, there is under these conditions a prodigious scour upon the\r\nbottom which tends to dig a pit just above and below the dam—a _scape\r\ncolk_—and carry the materials up to the surface below the pit. Such\r\na tendency was well illustrated by the behavior of the water at the\r\nopening of the Neu Haufen dam below the city of Vienna (Fig. 305 _a_).\r\nIn the case of ice, material from the bottom may by the upward current\r\nbe brought up to the surface of the glacier at the lower edge of the\r\ncolk and thus produce a type of local surface moraine of horseshoe\r\nform with its direction generally transverse to the direction of ice\r\nmovement (Fig. 305 _b_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 305.—_a_, Map showing pit excavated by the current below the\r\nopening in a dam. _b_, Nunataks and surface moraines on the Greenland\r\nice. Dalager’s Nunataks (after Suess).]\r\n\r\nAny obstruction upon the pavement of the glacier apparently exerts a\r\nlarger or smaller tendency to elevate the bowlders and pebbles and\r\nincorporate them within the ice. Rock débris thus incorporated is\r\ndescribed as _englacial_ drift. In the case of Greenland glaciers this\r\nmaterial seems at the ice front to be largely restricted to the lower\r\n100 feet (plate 13 A).\r\n\r\nNear the front of the inland ice the increased slope of the upper\r\nsurface greatly increases the flow of the upper ice layers in\r\ncomparison with those nearer the bottom, so that the upper layers\r\noverride the lower as they would an obstruction. The englacial drift\r\nis either for this reason or because of rock obstructions brought to\r\nthe surface, where it yields parallel ridges corresponding in direction\r\nto the glacier margin. Such transverse surface moraines are thus in\r\nmany respects analogous to those which appear about the lower margins\r\nof scape colks. In contrast to the longitudinal or medial surface\r\nmoraines the materials of the transverse moraines are more faceted and\r\nrounded—they have been abraded upon the glacier pavement.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Melting upon the glacier margins in Greenland.=—During the short but\r\nwarm summer season, the margins of the Greenland ice are subject to\r\nconsiderable losses through surface melting. When the uppermost ice\r\nlayer has attained a temperature of 32° Fahrenheit, melting begins\r\nand moves rapidly inward from the glacier margin. In late spring the\r\nsurface of the outer marginal zone is saturated with water, and this\r\nzone of slush advances inward with the season, but apparently never\r\ntransgresses the inner border of what we have generally referred to as\r\nthe marginal zone of the ice characterized by relatively steep slopes,\r\ncrevasses, and nunataks. Upon the ice within this zone are found\r\nstreams large enough to be designated as rivers and these are connected\r\nwith pools, lakes, and morasses. The dirt and rock fragments imbedded\r\nin the ice are melted out in the lowering of the surface, so that late\r\nin the season the ice presents a most dirty aspect. At the front of the\r\ngreat mountain glaciers of Alaska, a more vigorous operation of the\r\nsame process has yielded a surface soil in which grow such rank forests\r\nas entirely to mask the presence of the ice beneath.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the visible streams upon the surface of the Greenland\r\nice, there are others which flow beneath and can be heard by putting\r\nthe ear to the surface. All surface streams eventually encounter the\r\nmarginal crevasses and plunge down in foaming cascades, producing the\r\nwell known “glacier wells” or “glacier mills.” The progress of the\r\nwater is now throughout in tunnels within the ice until it again makes\r\nits appearance at the glacier margin.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 306.—Marginal moraine now forming at the edge of Greenland inland\r\nice, showing a smooth rock pavement outside it. A small lake with a\r\npartial covering of lake ice occupies a hollow of this pavement (after\r\nvon Drygalski).]\r\n\r\n=The marginal moraines.=—Study of both the Greenland and Antarctic\r\nglaciers has shown that if we disregard the smaller and short-period\r\nmigrations of the ice front, the general later movement has been a\r\nretrograde one—we live in a receding hemicycle of glaciation. The\r\nearlier Greenland glacier has now receded so as to expose large areas\r\nof the former glacier pavement. In places this pavement is largely\r\nbare, indicating a relatively rapid retirement of the ice front, but\r\nat all points at which the ice margin was halted there is now found a\r\nridge of unassorted rock materials which were dropped by the ice as it\r\nmelted (Fig. 306). Such ridges, composed of the unassorted materials\r\ndescribed as _till_, come to have a festooned arrangement largely\r\nconcentric to the ice margin, and are the _marginal_ or _terminal\r\nmoraines_ (see Fig. 336, p. 312). Marginal moraines, if of large\r\ndimensions, usually have a hummocky surface, and are apt to be composed\r\nof rock fragments of a wide range of size from rock flour (clay) to\r\nlarge bowlders (plate 17 A), which may represent many types since they\r\nhave been plucked by the glacier or gathered in at its surface from\r\nmany widely separated localities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 307.—Small lake impounded between the ice front and a moraine\r\nwhich it has recently built. Greenland (after von Drygalski).]\r\n\r\nAs the glacier front retires from the moraine which it has built up,\r\nthe water which emerges from beneath the ice is impounded behind the\r\nnew dam so as to form a lake of crescentic outline (Fig. 307). Such\r\nlakes are particularly short-lived, for the reason that the water finds\r\nan outlet over the lowest point in the crest of the moraine and easily\r\ncuts a gorge through the loose materials, thus draining the lake (Fig.\r\n308). Thereafter, the escaping water flows in a braided stream across\r\nthe late lake bottom and thence at the bottom of the gorge through the\r\nmoraine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 308.—View of a drained lake bottom between the moraine-covered\r\nice front in the foreground and an abandoned marginal moraine in the\r\nmiddle distance. The water flows from the ice front in a braided stream\r\nand passes out through the moraine in a narrow gorge. Variegated\r\nglacier, Alaska (after Lawrence Martin).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The outwash plain or apron.=—The water which descends from the\r\nglacier surface in the glacier wells or mills, eventually arrives at\r\nthe bottom, where it follows a sinuous course within a tunnel melted\r\nout in the ice. Much of this water may issue at the ice front beneath\r\nthe coarse rock materials which are found there, and so be discovered\r\nwith the ear rather than by the eye. The water within the tunnels not\r\nflowing with a free surface but being confined as though it were in\r\na pipe, may, however, reach the glacier margin under a hydrostatic\r\npressure sufficient to carry it up rising grades. Inasmuch as it is\r\nheavily charged with rock débris and is suddenly checked upon arriving\r\nat the front it deposits its burden about the ice margin so as to build\r\nup plains of assorted sands and gravels, and over this surface it flows\r\nin ever shifting serpentine channels of braided type (Fig. 308). Such\r\nplains of glacier outwash are described as _outwash plains_ or _outwash\r\naprons_.\r\n\r\nRising as it does under hydrostatic pressure the water issuing at the\r\nglacier front may find its way upward in some of the crevasses and so\r\nemerge at a level considerably above the glacial floor. It may thus\r\ncome about that the outwash plain is built up about the nose of the\r\nglacier so as partially to bury it from sight. When now the ice front\r\nbegins a rapid retirement, a depression or _fosse_ (Fig. 309 and Fig.\r\n339, p. 314) is left behind the outwash plain and in front of the\r\nmoraine which is built up at the next halting place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 309.—Diagrams to show the manner of formation\r\nand the structure of an outwash plain, and the position of the fosse\r\nbetween this and the moraine.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The continental glacier of Antarctica.=—In Victoria Land, upon the\r\ncontinent of Antarctica, so far as exploration has yet gone, the\r\ncontinental glacier is held back by a rampart of mountains, as has been\r\nshown to be true of the inland ice of Greenland. The same flat dome or\r\nshield has likewise been found to characterize its upper surface (Fig.\r\n310).\r\n\r\nThe most noteworthy differences between the inland ice masses of\r\nGreenland and Antarctica are to be ascribed to the greater severity of\r\nthe Antarctic climate and to the more ample nourishment of the southern\r\nglacier measured by the land area which it has submerged. There is here\r\nno marginal land ribbon as in Greenland, but the glacier covers all\r\nthe land and is, moreover, extended upon the sea as a broad floating\r\nterrace—the shelf ice (Fig. 311). This barrier at its margin puts a\r\nbar to all further navigation, rising as it does in some cases 280 feet\r\nabove the sea and descending to even greater depths below (plate 15 B).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 310.—Map showing the inland ice of Victoria Land bordered by the\r\nshelf ice of the Great Ross Barrier. The arrows show the direction of\r\nthe prevailing winds (based on maps by Scott and Shackleton).]\r\n\r\nIn that portion of Antarctica which was explored by the German\r\nexpedition, the inland ice is not as in Victoria Land restrained\r\nwithin walls of rock, but is spread out upon the continent so as\r\nto assume its natural ice slopes, which are therefore much flatter\r\nthan those examined in Greenland and Victoria Land. Here in Kaiser\r\nWilhelm Land the ice rises at its sea margin in a cliff which is\r\nfrom 130 to 165 feet in height, then upon a fairly steeply curving\r\nslope to an elevation of perhaps a thousand feet. Here the grades\r\nhave become relatively level, and on ever flatter slopes the surface\r\nappears to continue into the distant interior (plate 14). Near the\r\nice margin numerous fissures betray a motion within the mass which\r\nexact measurements indicate to be but one foot per day, and at a\r\ndistance of a mile and a quarter from the margin even this slight\r\nvalue has diminished by fully one eighth. It can hardly be doubted\r\nthat at moderate distances only within the ice margin, the glacier is\r\npractically without motion.\r\n\r\n┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n│   PLATE 14.                                                    │\r\n│                                                                │\r\n│ [Illustration: View of the margin of the Antarctic continental │\r\n│ glacier in Kaiser Wilhelm Land (after E. v.

This is to a large extent explained by the existence upon\r\nthe northern land mass of a coastland ribbon which becomes quickly\r\nheated in the sun’s rays, and both by warming the air and by radiating\r\nheat to the ice it causes melting and produces local air temperatures\r\nwhich in summer may even be described as hot. About Independence Bay in\r\nlatitude 82° N. and near the northernmost extremity of Greenland, Peary\r\ndescended from the inland ice into a little valley within which musk\r\noxen were lazily grazing and where bees buzzed from blossom to blossom\r\nover a gorgeous carpet of flowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 311.—Sections across the inland ice of Victoria\r\nLand, Antarctica, with the shelf ice in front (after Shackleton).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Nourishment of continental glaciers.=—Explorations upon and about the\r\nglaciers of Greenland and Antarctica have shown that the circulation\r\nof air above these vast ice shields conforms to a quite simple and\r\nsymmetrical model subject to spasmodic pulsations of a very pronounced\r\ntype. Each great ice mass with its atmospheric cover constitutes a sort\r\nof refrigerating air engine and plays an important part in the wind\r\nsystem of the globe. (See Fig. 291, p. 263). Both the domed surface and\r\nthe low temperature of the glacier are essential to the continuation of\r\nthis pulsating movement within the atmosphere (Fig. 312). The air layer\r\nin contact with the ice is during a period of calm cooled, contracted,\r\nand rendered heavier, so that it begins to slide downward and outward\r\nupon the domed surface in all directions. The extreme flatness of\r\nthe greater portion of the glacier surface—a fraction only of one\r\ndegree—makes the engine extremely slow in starting, but like all\r\nbodies which slide upon inclined planes, the velocity of its movement\r\nis rapidly accelerated, until a blizzard is developed whose vigor is\r\nunsurpassed by any elsewhere experienced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 312.—Diagram to show the nature of the fixed\r\nglacial anticyclone above continental glaciers and the process by which\r\ntheir surface is shaped.]\r\n\r\nThe effect of such centrifugal air currents above the glacier is to\r\nsuck down the air of the upper currents in order to supply the void\r\nwhich soon tends to develop over the central portion of the glacier\r\ndome. This downward vortex, fed as it is by inward-blowing, high-level\r\ncurrents, and drained by outwardly directed surface currents, is what\r\nis known as an _anticyclone_, here fixed in position by the central\r\nembossment of the dome.\r\n\r\nThe air which descends in the central column is warmed by compression,\r\nor adiabatically, just as air is warmed which is forced into a rubber\r\ntire by the use of a pump. The moisture congealed in the cirrus clouds\r\nfloating in the uppermost layer of the convective zone, is carried\r\ndown in this vortex and first melted and in turn evaporated, due to\r\nthe adiabatic effect. This fusion and evaporation of the ice by its\r\ntransformation of latent, to sensible, heat, in a measure counteracts,\r\nand so retards, the adiabatic elevation of temperature within the\r\ncolumn. Eventually the warm air now charged with water vapor reaches\r\nthe ice surface, is at once chilled, and its burden of moisture\r\nprecipitated in the form of fine snow needles, the so-called “frost\r\nsnow”, which in accompaniment to the sudden elevation of temperature is\r\nprecipitated at the termination of a blizzard.\r\n\r\nThe warming of the air has, however, had the effect of damping as it\r\nwere, the engine stroke, and, as the process is continued, to start a\r\nreverse or upward current within the chimney of the anticyclone. The\r\nblizzard is thus suddenly ended in a precipitation of the snow, which\r\nby changing the latent heat of condensation to sensible heat tends to\r\nincrease this counter current.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 313.—Snow deltas about the margins of the Fan\r\nglacier outlet of Greenland (after Chamberlin).]\r\n\r\n=The glacier broom.=—During the calm which succeeds to the blizzard,\r\nheat is once more abstracted from the surface air layer, and a new\r\noutwardly directed engine stroke is begun. The tempest which later\r\ndevelops acts as a gigantic centrifugal broom which sweeps out to\r\nthe margins of the glacier all portions of the latest snowfall which\r\nhave not become firmly attached to the ice surface. The sweepings\r\npiled up about the margin of continental glaciers have been described\r\nas fringing glaciers, or the glacial fringe. The northern coast of\r\nGreenland and Grant Land are bordered by a fringe of this nature (plate\r\n14 A, and Fig. 315, p. 288). It is by the operation of the glacier\r\nbroom that the inland ice is given its characteristic shield-like shape\r\n(Fig. 312). The granular nature of the snow carried by the wind is well\r\nbrought out by the little snow deltas about the margins of Greenland\r\nice tongues (Fig. 313). Obviously because of the presence of the\r\nvigorous anticyclone, no snows such as nourish mountain glaciers can be\r\nprecipitated upon continental glaciers except within a narrow marginal\r\nzone, and, as shown by Nansen rock dust from the coastland ribbon and\r\nfrom the nunataks of Greenland, is carried by a few miles inside the\r\nwestern margin, and not at all within the eastern.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 314.—Sea ice of the Arctic region in lat. 80° 5´\r\nN. and long. 2° 52´ E. (after Duc d’Orleans).]\r\n\r\n=Field and pack ice.=—Within polar regions the surface of the sea\r\nfreezes during the long winter season, the product being known as\r\n_sea-ice_ or _field-ice_ (Fig. 314). This ice cover may reach a\r\nthickness by direct freezing of eight or more feet, and by breaking up\r\nand being crowded above and below neighboring fragments may increase to\r\na considerably greater thickness. Ice thus crowded together and more or\r\nless crushed is described as _pack ice_ or _the pack_.\r\n\r\nThe pack does not remain stationary but is continually drifting with\r\nthe wind and tide, first in one direction and then in another, but\r\nwith a general drift in the direction of the prevailing winds. Because\r\nof the vast dimensions of the pack, the winds over widely separated\r\nparts may be contrary in direction, and hence when currents blow\r\ntoward each other or when the ice is forced against a land area, it\r\nis locally crushed under mighty pressures and forced up into lines of\r\n_hummocks_—the so-called _pressure ridges_. At other times, when the\r\nwinds of widely separated areas blow away from each other, the pack is\r\nparted, with the formation of lanes or _leads_ of open water.\r\n\r\nIf seen in bird’s-eye view the lines of hummocks would according to\r\nNansen be arranged like the meshes of a net having roughly squared\r\nangles and reaching to heights of 15 to 25, rarely 30, feet above the\r\ngeneral surface of the pack. The ice within each mesh of the network\r\nis a _floe_, which at the times of pressure is ground against its\r\nneighbors and variously shifted in position. At the margin of the pack\r\nthese floes become separated and float toward lower latitudes until\r\nthey are melted.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The drift of the pack.=—The discovery of the drift in the Arctic\r\npack is a romantic chapter in the history of polar exploration, and\r\nhas furnished an example of faith in scientific reasoning and judgment\r\nwhich may well be compared with that of Columbus. The great figure in\r\nthis later discovery is the Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen, and to\r\nthe final achievement the ill-fated _Jeannette_ expedition contributed\r\nan important part.\r\n\r\nThe _Jeannette_ carrying the American exploring expedition was in 1879\r\ncaught in the pack to the northward of Wrangel Island (Fig. 315), and\r\ntwo years later was crushed by the ice and sunk to the northward of\r\nthe New Siberian Islands. In 1884 various articles, including a list\r\nof stores in the handwriting of the commander of the _Jeannette_, were\r\npicked up at Julianehaab near the southern extremity of Greenland\r\nbut upon the western side of Cape Farewell. Nansen, having carefully\r\nverified the facts, concluded that the recovered articles could have\r\nfound their way to Julianehaab only by drifting in the pack across the\r\npolar sea, and that at the longest only five years had been consumed\r\nin the transit. After being separated from the pack the articles must\r\nhave floated in the current which makes southward along the east coast\r\nof Greenland and after doubling Cape Farewell flows northward upon the\r\nwest coast. It was clear that if they had come through Smith Sound they\r\nwould inevitably have been found upon the other shore of Baffin Bay. In\r\nconfirmation of this view there was found at Godthaab, a short distance\r\nto the northward of Julianehaab (Fig. 315), an ornamented Alaskan\r\n“throwing stick” which probably came by the same route. Moreover,\r\nlarge quantities of driftwood reach the shores of Greenland which have\r\nclearly come from the Siberian coast, since the Siberian larch has\r\nfurnished the larger quantity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 315.—Map of the north polar regions, showing the\r\narea of drift ice and the tracks of the _Jeannette_ and the _Fram_\r\n(compiled from various maps).]\r\n\r\nPinning his faith to these indubitable facts, Nansen built the _Fram_\r\nin such a manner as to resist and elude the enormous pressures of\r\nthe ice pack, stocked her with provisions sufficient for five years,\r\nand by allowing the vessel to be frozen into the pack north of the\r\nNew Siberian Islands, he consigned himself and his companions to the\r\nmercy of the elements. The world knows the result as one of the most\r\nremarkable achievements in the long history of polar exploration. The\r\ntrack of the _Fram_, charted in Fig. 315, considered in connection with\r\nthat of the _Jeannette_, shows that the Arctic pack drifts from Bering\r\nSea westward until near the northeastern coast of Greenland.\r\n\r\nSpecial casks were for experimental purposes fastened in the ice to\r\nthe north of Behring Strait by Melville and Bryant, and two of these\r\nwere afterwards recovered, the one near the North Cape in northern\r\nNorway, and the other in northeastern Iceland (see map, Fig. 315).\r\nPeary’s trips northward in 1906 and 1909 from the vicinity of Smith\r\nSound have indicated that between the Pole and the shores of Greenland\r\nand Grant Land the drift is throughout to the eastward, corresponding\r\nto the westerly wind. Upon this border the great area of Arctic drift\r\nice is in contact with great continental glaciers bordered by a glacier\r\nfringe. Admiral Peary has shown that instead of consisting of frozen\r\nsea ice, the pack is here made up of great floes from 20 to 100 feet in\r\nthickness and that these have been derived from the glacier fringe.\r\n\r\nWhenever the blizzards blow off the inland ice from the south, leads\r\nare opened at the margin of the fringe and may carry strips from the\r\nlatter northward across the lead. With favorable conditions these\r\nleads may be closed by thick sea ice so that with the occurrence of\r\ncounter winds from the north they do not entirely return to their\r\noriginal position. A continuance of this process may have resulted in\r\nthe heavy floe ice to the northward of Greenland, which, acting as\r\nan obstruction, may have forced the thinner drift ice to keep on the\r\nEuropean side of the Arctic pack.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 316.—The shelf ice of Coats Land with the\r\nsurrounding pack ice showing in the foreground (after Bruce).]\r\n\r\nAbout the Antarctic continent there is a broad girdle of pack ice\r\nwhich, while more indolent in its movements than the Arctic pack, has\r\nbeen shown by the expeditions of the _Belgica_ and the _Pourquoi-Pas_\r\nto possess the same kind of shifting movements. In the southern spring\r\nthis pack floats northward and is to a large extent broken up and\r\nmelted on reaching lower latitudes.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 317.—Tidewater cliff at the front of a glacier\r\ntongue from which icebergs are born.]\r\n\r\n=The Antarctic shelf ice.=—It has been already pointed out that the\r\ninland ice of Antarctica is in part at least surrounded by a thick\r\nsnow and ice terrace floating upon the sea and rising to heights of\r\nmore than 150 feet above it (plate 15 B and Fig. 316). The visible\r\nportions of this shelf-ice are of stratified compact snow, and the\r\nareas which have thus far been studied are found in bays from which\r\ndislodgment is less easily effected. The origin of the shelf ice is\r\nbelieved to be a sea-ice which because not easily detached at the time\r\nof the spring “break-up” is thickened in succeeding seasons chiefly by\r\nthe deposition of precipitated and drifted snow upon its surface, so\r\nthat it is bowed down under the weight and sunk to greater and greater\r\ndepths in the water. To some extent, also, it is fed upon its inner\r\nmargin by overflow of glacier ice from the inland ice masses.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Icebergs and snowbergs and the manner of their birth.=—Greenland\r\nreveals in the character of its valleys the marks of a large subsidence\r\nof the continent—the serpentine inlets or fjords by which its coast is\r\nso deeply indented. Into the heads of these fjords the tongues from the\r\ninland ice descend generally to the sea level and below. The glacier\r\nice is thus directly attacked by the waves as well as melted in the\r\nwater, so that it terminates in the fjords in great cliffs of ice (Fig.\r\n317). It is also believed to extend beneath the water surface as a long\r\ntoe resting upon the bottom (Fig. 319).\r\n\r\n┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n│   PLATE 15.                                                       │\r\n│                                                                   │\r\n│ [Illustration: _A._ An Antarctic ice foot with boat party landing │\r\n│ (after R.

Such small bergs, whose birth may be often seen at the cliff\r\nfront of both the Greenland and Alaskan glaciers, have little in common\r\nwith those great floating islands of ice that are drifted by the winds\r\nuntil, wasted to a fraction only of their former proportions, they\r\nreach the lanes of transatlantic travel and become a serious menace to\r\nnavigation (Fig. 318).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 319.—Diagram showing one way in which northern\r\nicebergs may be born from the glacier tongue (after Russell).]\r\n\r\nNorthern icebergs of large dimensions are born either by the lifting of\r\na separated portion of the extended glacier toe lying upon the bottom\r\nof the fjord, or else they separate bodily from the cliff itself,\r\napparently where it reaches water sufficiently deep to float it. In\r\neither case the buoyancy of the sea water plays a large rôle in its\r\nseparation.\r\n\r\nIf derived from the submerged glacier toe (Fig. 319), a loud noise is\r\nheard before any change is visible, and an instant later the great\r\nmass of ice rises out of the water some distance away from the cliff,\r\nlifting as it does so a great volume of water which pours off on all\r\nsides in thundering cascades and exposes at last a berg of the deepest\r\nsapphire blue. The commotion produced in the fjord is prodigious, and a\r\nvessel in close proximity is placed in jeopardy.\r\n\r\nEven larger bergs are sometimes seen to separate from the ice cliff, in\r\nthis case an instant before or simultaneously, with a loud report, but\r\nsuch bergs float away with comparatively little commotion in the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 320.—A northern iceberg surrounded by sea ice.]\r\n\r\nThe icebergs of the south polar region are usually built upon a far\r\ngrander scale than those of the Arctic regions, and are, further, both\r\ndistinctly tabular in form and bounded by rectangular outlines (Fig.\r\n321). Whereas the large bergs of Greenlandic origin are of ice and blue\r\nin color, the tabular bergs of Antarctica might better be described\r\nas _snowbergs_, since they are of a blinding whiteness and their\r\nvisible portions are either compacted snow or alternating thick layers\r\nof compact snow and thin ribbons of blue ice, the latter thicker and\r\nmore abundant toward the base. All such bergs have been derived from\r\nthe shelf ice and not from the inland ice itself. Blue icebergs which\r\nhave been derived from the inland ice have been described from the\r\none Antarctic land that has been explored in which that ice descends\r\ndirectly to the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 321.—Tabular Antarctic iceberg separating from the\r\nshelf ice (after Shackleton).]\r\n\r\nIn both the northern and southern hemispheres those bergs which have\r\nfloated into lower latitudes have suffered profound transformations.\r\nTheir exposed surfaces have been melted in the sun, washed by the\r\nrain, and battered by the waves, so that they lose their relatively\r\nsimple forms but acquire rounded surfaces in place of the early angular\r\nones (Fig. 318, p. 291). Sir John Murray, who had such extended\r\nopportunities of studying the southern icebergs from the deck of the\r\n_Challenger_, has thus described their beauties:\r\n\r\n “Waves dash, against the vertical faces of the floating ice island as\r\n against a rocky shore, so that at the sea level they are first cut\r\n into ledges and gullies, and then into caves and caverns of the most\r\n heavenly blue, from out of which there comes the resounding roar of\r\n the ocean, and into which the snow-white and other petrels may be seen\r\n to wing their way through guards of soldier-like penguins stationed\r\n at the entrances. As these ice islands are slowly drifted by wind and\r\n current to the north, they tilt, turn and sometimes capsize, and then\r\n submerged prongs and spits are thrown high into the air, producing\r\n irregular pinnacled bergs higher, possibly, than the original\r\n table-shaped mass.”\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING REFERENCES FOR CHAPTERS XX AND XXI\r\n\r\n General:—\r\n\r\n I.

The latest of these\r\noccurred in the yesterday of geology and has often been referred to as\r\nthe “ice age”, because until quite recently it was supposed to be the\r\nonly one of which a record was preserved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 322.—Map of the globe showing the areas which were\r\ncovered by the continental glaciers of the so-called “ice-age” of the\r\nPleistocene period. The arrows show the directions of the centrifugal\r\nair currents in the fixed anticyclones above the glaciers.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 323.—Glaciated granite bowlder which has weathered out of a\r\nmoraine of Permo-Carboniferous age upon which it rests. South Australia\r\n(after Howchin).]\r\n\r\nThis latest ice age represents four complete cycles of glaciation, for\r\nit is believed that the continental ice developed and then completely\r\ndisappeared during a period of mild climate before the next glacier\r\nhad formed in its place, and that this alternation of climates was\r\nno less than three times repeated, making four cycles in all. At\r\nnearly or quite the same time ice masses developed in northern North\r\nAmerica and in northern Europe, the embossments of the ice domes being\r\nlocated in Canada and in Scandinavia respectively (Fig. 322). There\r\nappears to have been at this time no extensive glaciation of the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, though in the next earlier of the known great\r\nperiods of glaciation—the so-called Permo-Carboniferous—it was the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, and not the northern, that was affected (Fig.\r\n323 and Fig. 304, p. 276). From the still earlier glacial period our\r\ndata are naturally much more meager, but it seems probable that it\r\nwas characterized by glaciated areas within both the northern and the\r\nsouthern hemispheres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 324.—Map to show the glaciated and nonglaciated\r\nregions of North America (after Salisbury and Atwood).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Contrast of the glaciated and nonglaciated regions.=—Since we have\r\nnow studied in brief outline the characteristics of the existing\r\ncontinental glaciers, we are in a position to review the evidences of\r\nformer glaciers, the records of which exist in their carvings, their\r\ngravings, and their deposits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 325.—Map of the glaciated and nonglaciated areas of northern\r\nEurope. The strongly marked morainal belts respectively south and north\r\nof the Baltic depression represent halting places in the retreat of the\r\nlatest continental glacier (compiled from maps by Penck and Leverett).]\r\n\r\nAn observant person familiar with the aspects of Nature in both the\r\nnorthern and southern portions of the central and eastern United States\r\nmust have noticed that the general courses of the Ohio and Missouri\r\nrivers define a somewhat marked common border of areas which in most\r\nrespects are sharply contrasted (Fig. 324). Hardly less striking is the\r\ncontrast between the glaciated and the nonglaciated regions upon the\r\ncontinent of Europe (Fig. 325).\r\n\r\nIt is the northern of the two areas which in each case reveals\r\nthe characteristic evidences of glaciation, while there is entire\r\nabsence of such marks to the southward of the common border. Within\r\nthe American glaciated region there is, however, an area surrounded\r\nlike an island, and within this district (Fig. 324) none of the marks\r\ncharacteristic of glaciation are to be found. This area is usually\r\nreferred to as the “driftless area”, and occupies portions of the\r\nstates of Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, and Iowa. Even better than\r\nthe area to the southward of the Ohio and Missouri rivers, it permits\r\nof a comparison of the nonglaciated with the drift-covered region.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 326.—“Stand Rock” near the “Dells” of the Wisconsin river, an\r\nunstable erosion remnant characteristic of the driftless area of North\r\nAmerica (after Salisbury and Atwood).]\r\n\r\n=The “driftless area.”=—Within this district, then, we have preserved\r\nfor our study a landscape which remains largely as it was before\r\nthe several ice invasions had so profoundly transformed the general\r\nsurface of the surrounding country. Speaking broadly, we may say that\r\nit represents an uplifted and in part dissected plain, which to the\r\nsouth and east particularly reveals the character of nearly mature\r\nriver erosion (Fig. 177, p. 170). The rock surface is here everywhere\r\nmantled by decomposed and disintegrated rock residues of local origin.\r\nThe soluble constituents of the rock, such as the carbonates, have\r\nbeen removed by the process of leaching, so that the clays no longer\r\neffervesce when treated with dilute mineral acid.\r\n\r\nWherever favored by joints and by an alternation of harder and softer\r\nrock layers, picturesque unstable erosion remnants or “chimneys” may\r\nstand out in relief (Fig. 326). Furthermore, the driftless area is\r\nthroughout perfectly drained—it is without lakes or swamps—since\r\nall valleys are characterized throughout by forward grades. The side\r\nvalleys enter the main valleys as do the branches a tree trunk; in\r\nother words, the drainage is described as arborescent. In so far as any\r\nportions of a plane surface now remain in the landscape, they are found\r\nat the highest levels (plate 16 A). The topography is thus the result\r\nof a partial removal by erosion of an upland and may be described as\r\n_incised topography_. Nowhere within the area are there found rock\r\nmasses foreign to the region, but all mantle rock is the weathered\r\nproduct of the underlying ledges.\r\n\r\n┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n│  PLATE 16.                                                         │\r\n│                                                                    │\r\n│ [Illustration: _A._ Incised topography within the “driftless area” │\r\n│ (U.

The characteristic topography of the\r\n“drift” areas is by contrast _built up_; that is to say, the features\r\nof the region instead of being _carved_ out of a plain are the result\r\nof _molding_ by the process of deposition (plate 16 B). In so far as a\r\nplane is recognizable, it is to be found not at the highest, but at the\r\nlowest level—a surface represented largely by swamps and lakes—and\r\nabove this plain rise the characteristic rounded hills of various types\r\nwhich have been _built up_ through deposition. The process by which\r\nthis has been accomplished is one easy to comprehend. As it invaded the\r\nregion, the glacier planed away beneath its marginal zone all weathered\r\nmantle rock and deposited the planings within the hollows of the\r\nsurface (Fig. 327). The effect has been to flatten out the preëxisting\r\nirregularities of the surface, and to yield at first a gently\r\nundulating plain upon which are many undrained areas and a haphazard\r\nsystem of drainage (Fig. 328). All unstable erosion remnants, such as\r\nnow are to be found within the driftless area, were the first to be\r\ntoppled over by the invading glacier, and in their place there is left\r\nat best only rounded and polished “shoulders” of hard and unweathered\r\nrock—the well-known _roches moutonnées_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 327.—Diagram showing the manner in which a continental glacier\r\nobliterates existing valleys (after Tarr).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The glacier gravings.=—The tools with which the glacier works are\r\nnever quite evenly edged, and instead of an in all respects perfect\r\npolish upon the rock pavement, there are left furrowings, gougings, and\r\nscratches. Of whatever sort, these scorings indicate the lines of ice\r\nmovement and are thus indubitable records graven upon the rock floor.\r\nWhen mapped over wide areas, a most interesting picture is presented to\r\nour view, and one which supplements in an important way the studies of\r\nexisting continental glaciers (Fig. 334, p. 308, and Fig. 336, p. 312).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 328.—Lake and marsh district in northern\r\nWisconsin, the effect of glacial deposition in former valleys (after\r\nFairbanks).]\r\n\r\nIt has been customary to think of the glacier as everywhere eroding\r\nits bed, although the only warrant for assuming degradation by flow of\r\nthe ice is restricted to the marginal zone, since here only is there\r\nan appreciable surface grade likely to induce flow. Both upon the\r\nadvance and again during the retreat of a glacier, all parts of the\r\narea overridden must be subjected to this action. Heretofore pictured\r\nin the imagination as enlarged models of Alpine glaciers, the vast\r\nice mantles were conceived to have spread out over the country as the\r\nresult of a kind of viscous flow like that of molasses poured upon\r\na flat surface in cold weather. The maximum thickness of the latest\r\nAmerican glacier of the ice age has been assumed to have been perhaps\r\n10,000 feet near the summit of its dome in central Labrador. From this\r\npoint it was assumed that the ice traveled southward up the northern\r\nslope of the Laurentian divide in Canada, and thence to the Ohio river,\r\na distance of over 1300 miles. If such a mantle of ice be represented\r\nin its natural proportions in vertical section, to cover the distance\r\nfrom center to margin we may use a line six inches in length, and\r\nonly 1/100 of an inch thick. Upon a reduced scale these proportions\r\nare given in Fig. 329. Obviously the force of gravity acting within\r\na viscous mass of such proportions would be incompetent to effect a\r\ntransfer of material from the center to the periphery, even though the\r\nthickness should be doubled or trebled. Yet until the fixed glacial\r\nanticyclone above the glacier had been proven and its efficiency as a\r\nbroom recognized, no other hypothesis than that of viscous flow had\r\nbeen offered in explanation. The inherited conception of a universal\r\nplucking and abrasion on the bed of the glacier is thus made untenable\r\nand can be accepted for the marginal portion only.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 329.—Cross section in approximate natural\r\nproportions of the latest North American continental glacier of\r\nPleistocene age from its center to its margin.]\r\n\r\nNot only do the rock scorings show the lines of ice movement, but\r\nthe directions as well may often be read upon the rock. Wherever\r\nthere are pronounced irregularities of surface still existing on the\r\npavement, these are generally found to have gradual slopes upon the\r\nside from which the ice came, and relatively steep falls upon the\r\nlee or “pluck” side. If, however, we consider the irregularities of\r\nsmaller size, the unsymmetrical slopes of these protruding portions\r\nof the floor are found to be reversed—it is the steep slope which\r\nfaces the oncoming ice and the flatter slope which is upon the lee\r\nside. Such minor projections upon the floor usually have their origin\r\nin some harder nodule which deflects the abrading tools and causes\r\nthem to pass, some on the one side and some upon the other. By this\r\nprocess a staple-shaped groove comes to surround the nodule, leaving an\r\nunsymmetrical elevated ridge within, which is steep upon the stoss side\r\nand slopes gently away to leeward.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 330.—Limestone surface at Sibley, Michigan.]\r\n\r\n=Younger records over older—the glacier palimpsest.=—Many important\r\nhistorical facts have been recovered from the largely effaced writing\r\nupon ancient palimpsests, or parchments upon which an earlier record\r\nhas been intentionally erased to make room for another. In the\r\ngravings upon the glacier pavement, earlier records have been likewise\r\nin large part effaced by later, though in favorable localities the\r\ntwo may be read together. Thus, as an example, at the great limestone\r\nquarries of Sibley, in southeastern Michigan, the glaciated rock\r\nsurface wherever stripped of its drift cover is a smoothly polished and\r\nrelatively level floor with striæ which are directed west-northwest.\r\nBeneath this general surface there are, however, a number of elliptical\r\ndepressions which have their longer axes directed south-southwest, one\r\nbeing from twenty-five to thirty feet long and some ten feet in depth\r\n(Fig. 330). These boat-shaped depressions are clearly the remnants of\r\nan earlier more undulating surface which the latest glacier has in\r\nlarge part planed away, since the bottoms of the depressions are no\r\nless perfectly glaciated but have their striæ directed in general near\r\nthe longer axis of the troughs. Palimpsest-like there are here also the\r\nrecords of more than one graving.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 331.—Map to show the outcroppings of peculiar rock types in the\r\nregion of the Great Lakes, and some of the localities where “float\r\ncopper” has been collected (float copper localities after Salisbury).]\r\n\r\n=The dispersion of the drift.=—Long before the “ice age” had been\r\nconceived in the minds of Agassiz and his contemporaries, it had been\r\nremarked that scattered over the North German plain were rounded\r\nfragments of rock which could not possibly have been derived from their\r\nown neighborhood but which could be matched with the great masses of\r\nred granite in Sweden well known as the “Swedish granite.” Buckland, an\r\nEnglish geologist, had in 1815 accounted for such “erratic” blocks of\r\nhis own country, here of Scotch granite, by calling in the deluge of\r\nNoah; but in the late thirties of the nineteenth century, Sir Charles\r\nLyell, with the results of English Arctic explorers in mind, claimed\r\nthat such traveled blocks had been transported by icebergs emanating\r\nfrom the polar regions. A relic of Buckland’s earlier view we have\r\nin the word “diluvium” still occasionally used in Germany for glacier\r\ntransported materials; while the term “drift” still remains in common\r\nuse to recall Lyell’s iceberg hypothesis, even though the original\r\nmeaning of the term has been abandoned. Drift is now a generic term\r\nand refers to all deposits directly or indirectly referable to the\r\ncontinental glaciers.\r\n\r\nIn general the place of derivation of the glacial drift may be said to\r\nbe some point more distant from and within the former ice margin at the\r\ntime when it was deposited; in other words, the dispersion of the drift\r\nwas centrifugal with reference to the glacier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 332.—Map of the “bowlder train” from Iron Hill, R. I. (based upon\r\nShaler’s map, but with the directions of glacial striæ added).]\r\n\r\nWherever rocks of unusual and therefore easily recognizable character\r\ncan be shown to occur in place and with but limited areas, the\r\ndispersion of such material is easy to trace. The areas of red Swedish\r\nand Scotch granite have been used to follow out in a broad way the\r\ndispersion of drift over northern Europe. Within the region of the\r\nGreat Lakes of North America are areas of limited size which are\r\noccupied by well marked rock types, so that the journeyings of their\r\nfragments with the continental glacier can be mapped with some care.\r\nUpon the northern shore of Georgian Bay occurs the beautiful jasper\r\nconglomerate, whose bright red pebbles in their white quartz field\r\nattract such general notice. At Ishpeming in the northern peninsula of\r\nMichigan is found the equally beautiful jaspilite composed of puckered\r\nalternating layers of black hematite and red jasper. On Keweenaw\r\nPeninsula, which protrudes into Lake Superior from its southern shore,\r\nis found that remarkable occurrence of native copper within a series\r\nof igneous rocks of varied types and colors. Fragments of this copper,\r\nsome weighing several hundreds of pounds each and masked in a coat\r\nof green malachite, have under the name of “drift” or “float” copper\r\nbeen collected at many localities within a broad “fan” of dispersal\r\nextending almost to the very limits of glaciation (Fig. 331).\r\n\r\nSome miles to the north of Providence in Rhode Island there is a hill\r\nknown as Iron Hill composed in large part of black magnetite rock,\r\nthe so-called Cumberlandite. From this hill as an apex there has\r\nbeen dispersed a great quantity of the rock distributed as a well\r\nmarked “bowlder train” within which the size and the frequency of the\r\ndispersed bowlders is in inverse ratio to the distance from the parent\r\nledge (Fig. 332). Similar though less perfect trains of bowlders are\r\nfound on the lee side of most projecting masses of resistant rocks\r\nwithin the area of the drift.\r\n\r\nLarge bowlders when left upon a ledge of notably different appearance\r\neasily attract attention, and have been described as “perched\r\nbowlders.” Resting as they sometimes do upon a relatively small area,\r\nthey may be nicely balanced and thus easily given a pendular or rocking\r\nmotion. Such “rocking stones” are common enough, especially among the\r\nNew England hills (plate 17 B). Many such bowlders have made somewhat\r\nremarkable peregrinations with many interruptions, having been carried\r\nfirst in one direction by an earlier glacier to be later transported in\r\nwholly different directions at the time of new ice invasions.\r\n\r\n┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n│   PLATE 17.                                                       │\r\n│                                                                   │\r\n│ [Illustration: _A._ Soled glacial bowlders which show differently │\r\n│ directed striæ upon the same facet.]                              │\r\n│                                                                   │\r\n│ [Illustration: _B._ Perched bowlder upon a striated ledge of      │\r\n│ different rock type, Bronx Park, New York (after Lungstedt).]     │\r\n│                                                                   │\r\n│ [Illustration: _C._ Characteristic knob and basin surface of a    │\r\n│ moraine.]                                                         │\r\n└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\r\n\r\n\r\n=The diamonds of the drift.=—Of considerable popular, even if not\r\neconomic, interest are the diamonds which have been sown in the drift\r\nafter long and interrupted journeyings with the ice from some unknown\r\nhome far to the northward in the wilderness of Canada. The first stone\r\nto be discovered was taken by workmen from a well opening near the\r\nlittle town of Eagle in Wisconsin in the year 1876. Its nature not\r\nbeing known, it remained where it was found as a curiosity only, and it\r\nwas not until 1883 that it was taken to Milwaukee and sold to a jeweler\r\nequally ignorant of its value, and for the merely nominal sum of one\r\ndollar. Later recognized as a diamond of the unusual weight of sixteen\r\ncarats, it was sold to the Tiffanys and became the cause of a long\r\nlitigation which did not end until the Supreme Court of Wisconsin had\r\ndecided that the Milwaukee jeweler, and not the finder, was entitled to\r\nthe price of the stone, since he had been ignorant of its value at the\r\ntime of purchase.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 333.—Shapes and approximate natural sizes of some of the more\r\nimportant diamonds from the Great Lakes region of the United States. In\r\norder from left to right these figures represent the Eagle diamond of\r\nsixteen carats, the Saukville diamond of six and one half carats, the\r\nMilford diamond of six carats, the Oregon diamond of four carats, and\r\nthe Burlington diamond of a little over two carats.]\r\n\r\nAn even larger diamond, of twenty-one carats weight, was found at\r\nKohlsville, and smaller ones at Oregon, Saukville, Burlington, and Plum\r\nCreek in the state of Wisconsin; at Dowagiac in Michigan; at Milford in\r\nOhio, and in Morgan and Brown counties in Indiana. The appearance of\r\nsome of the larger stones in their natural size and shape may be seen\r\nin Fig. 333.\r\n\r\nWhile the number of the diamonds sown in the drift is undoubtedly\r\nlarge, their dispersion is such that it is little likely they can be\r\nprofitably recovered. The distribution of the localities at which\r\nstones have thus far been found is set forth upon Fig. 334. Obviously\r\nthose that have been found are the ones of larger size, since these\r\nonly attract attention. In 1893, when the finding of the Oregon stone\r\ndrew attention to these denizens of the drift, the writer prophesied\r\nthat other stones would occasionally be discovered under essentially\r\nthe same conditions, and such discoveries are certain to continue in\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 334.—Glacial map of a portion of the Great Lakes region,\r\nshowing the unglaciated area and the areas of older and newer drift.\r\nThe driftless area, the moraines of the later ice invasion, and the\r\ndistribution of diamond localities upon the latter are also shown.\r\nWith the aid of the directions of striæ some attempt has been made to\r\nindicate the probable tracks of more important diamonds, which tracks\r\nconverge in the direction of the Labrador peninsula.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tabulated comparison of the glaciated and nonglaciated regions.=—It\r\nwill now be profitable to sum up in parallel columns the contrasted\r\npeculiarities of the glaciated and the unglaciated regions.\r\n\r\n UNGLACIATED REGION                           GLACIATED REGION\r\n\r\n TOPOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n The topography is _destructional_; The topography is _constructional_;\r\n the remnants of a plain are found  the remnants of a plain are found\r\n at the highest levels or upon the  at the lowest levels in lakes and\r\n hill tops; hills are _carved_ out  swamps; hills are _molded_ above a\r\n of a high plain; unstable erosion  plain in characteristic forms; no\r\n remnants are characteristic.       unstable erosion remnants, but only\r\n                                    rounded shoulders of rock.\r\n\r\n DRAINAGE\r\n\r\n The area is completely drained,    The area includes undrained\r\n and the drainage network is        areas,—lakes and swamps,—and\r\n _arborescent_.                     the drainage system is _haphazard_.\r\n\r\n ROCK MANTLE\r\n\r\n The exposed rock is decomposed      No decomposed or disintegrated\r\n and disintegrated to a              rock is “in place”, but only\r\n considerable depth; it is all of    hard, fresh surface; loose rock\r\n local derivation and hence of few   material is all foreign and of many\r\n types—_homogeneous_; the fragments  sizes and types—_heterogeneous_;\r\n are angular; soils are leached and  rock bowlders and pebbles are\r\n hence do not contain carbonates.    faceted and polished as well as\r\n                                     striated, usually in several\r\n                                     directions upon each facet; soils\r\n                                     are rock flour—the grist of the\r\n                                     glacial mill.\r\n\r\n ROCK SURFACE\r\n\r\n Rock surface is rough and           Rock surface is planed or grooved,\r\n irregular.                          and polished. Shows glacial striæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Unassorted and assorted drift.=—The drift is of two distinct types;\r\nnamely, that deposited directly by the glacier, which is without\r\nstratification, or unassorted; and that deposited by water flowing\r\neither beneath or from the ice, and this like most fluid deposited\r\nmaterial is assorted or stratified. The unassorted material is\r\ndescribed as _till_, or sometimes as “bowlder clay”; the assorted\r\nis sand or gravel, sometimes with small included bowlders, and is\r\ndescribed as _kame gravel_. To recall the parts which both the glacier\r\nand the streams have played in its deposition, all water-deposited\r\nmaterials in connection with glaciers are called _fluvio-glacial_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 335.—Section in coarse till. Note the range in\r\nsize of the materials, the lack of stratification, and the “soled” form\r\nof the bowlders.]\r\n\r\nTill is, then, characterized by a noteworthy lack of homogeneity, both\r\nas regards the size and the composition of its constituent parts. As\r\nmany as twenty different rock types of varied textures and colors may\r\nsometimes be found in a single exposure of this material, and the\r\nentire gamut is run from the finest rock flour upon the one hand to\r\nbowlders whose diameter may be measured in feet (Fig. 335).\r\n\r\nIn contrast with those derived by ordinary stream action, the pebbles\r\nand bowlders of the till are faceted or “soled”, and usually show\r\nstriations upon their faces. If a number of pebbles are examined,\r\nsome at least are sure to be found with striations in more than one\r\ndirection upon a single facet. As a criterion for the discrimination\r\nof the material this may be an important mark to be made use of to\r\ndistinguish in special cases from rock fragments derived by brecciation\r\nand slickensiding and distributed by the torrents of arid and semiarid\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the capacity of ice for handling large masses is greater\r\nthan that of water, assorted drift is in general less coarse, and, as\r\nits name implies, it is also stratified. From ordinary stream gravels,\r\nthe kame gravels are distinguished by the form of their pebbles, which\r\nare generally faceted and in some cases striated. In proportion,\r\nhowever, as the materials are much worked over by the water, the\r\nangles between pebble faces become rounded and the original shapes\r\nconsiderably masked.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Features into which the drift is molded.=—Though the preëxisting\r\nvalleys were first filled in by drift materials, thus reducing the\r\naccent of the relief, a continuation of the same process resulted in\r\nthe superimposition of features of characteristic shapes upon the\r\nimperfectly evened surface of the earlier stages. These features belong\r\nto several different types, according as they were built up outside\r\nof, at and upon, or within the glacier margin. The extra-marginal\r\ndeposits are described as _outwash plains_ or _aprons_, or sometimes as\r\n_valley trains_; the marginal are either _moraines_ or _kames_; while\r\nwithin the border were formed the _till plain_ or _ground moraine_,\r\nand, locally also, the _drumlin_ and the _esker_ or _os_. These\r\ncharacteristic features are with few exceptions to be found only within\r\nthe area covered by the latest of the ice invasions. For the earlier\r\nones, so much time has now elapsed that the effect of weathering,\r\nwash, and stream erosion has been such that few of the features are\r\nrecognizable.\r\n\r\nMarginal and extra-marginal features are extended in the direction\r\nof the margin or, in other words, perpendicular to the local ice\r\nmovement; while the intra-marginal deposits are as noteworthy for being\r\nperpendicular to the margin, or in correspondence with the direction\r\nof local ice movement. Each of these features possesses characteristic\r\nmarks in its form, its size, proportions, surface molding and\r\norientation, as well as in its constituent materials. It should perhaps\r\nbe pointed out that the existing continental glaciers, being in high\r\nlatitudes, work upon rock materials which have been subjected to\r\ndifferent weathering processes from those characteristic of temperate\r\nlatitudes. Moreover, the melting of the Pleistocene glaciers having\r\ntaken place in relatively low latitudes, larger quantities of rock\r\ndébris were probably released from the ice during the time of definite\r\nclimatic changes, and hence heavier drift accumulations have for both\r\nof these reasons resulted.\r\n\r\n=Marginal or “kettle” moraines.=—Wherever for a protracted period the\r\nmargin of the glacier was halted, considerable deposits of drift were\r\nbuilt up at the ice margin. These accumulations form, however, not only\r\nabout the margin, but upon the ice surface as well; in part due to\r\nmaterials collected from melting down of the surface, and in part by\r\nthe upturning of ice layers near the margin (see _ante_, p. 277).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 336.—Sketch map of portions of Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana,\r\nshowing the festooned outlines of the moraines about the former ice\r\nlobes, and the directions of ice movement as determined by the striæ\r\nupon the rock pavement (after Leverett).]\r\n\r\nAn important rôle is played by the thaw water which emerges at the\r\nice margin, especially within the reëntrants or recesses of the\r\noutline. The materials of moraines are, therefore, till with large\r\nlocal deposits of kame gravel, and these form in a series of ridges\r\ncorresponding to the temporary positions of the ice front. Their width\r\nmay range from a few rods to a few miles, their height may reach a\r\nhundred feet or more, and they stretch across the country for distances\r\nof hundreds or even thousands of miles, looped in arcs or scallops\r\nwhich are always convex outward and which meet in sharp cusps that in\r\na general way point toward the embossment of the former glacier (Fig.\r\n334, p. 308, and Fig. 336). These festoons of the moraines outline\r\nthe ice lobes of the latest ice invasion, which in North America were\r\ncentered over the depressions now occupied by the Laurentian lakes.\r\nThere was, thus, a Lake Superior lobe, a Lake Michigan lobe, etc. With\r\nthe aid of these moraine maps we may thus in imagination picture in\r\nbroad lines the frontal contours of the earlier glaciers. At specially\r\nfavorable localities where the ice front has crossed a deep valley at\r\nthe edge of the Driftless Area, we may, even in a rough way, measure\r\nthe slope of the ice face. Thus near Devils Lake in southern Wisconsin\r\nthe terminal moraine crosses the former valley of the Wisconsin River,\r\nand in so doing has dropped a distance of about four hundred feet\r\nwithin the distance of a half mile or thereabouts (Fig. 337).\r\n\r\nThe characteristic surface of the marginal moraine is responsible for\r\nthe name “kettle” moraine so generally applied to it. The “kettles” are\r\nroughly circular, undrained basins which lie among hummocks or knobs,\r\nso that the surface has often been referred to as “knob and basin”\r\ntopography (plate 17 C).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 337.—Map of the vicinity of Devils Lake, Wisconsin, located\r\nwithin a reëntrant of the “kettle” moraine upon the margin of the\r\nDriftless Area. The lake lies within an earlier channel of the\r\nWisconsin River which has been blocked at both ends, first by the\r\nglacier and later by its moraine. The stippled area upon the heights\r\nand next the moraine represents the clay deposits of a former lake\r\n(based on map by Salisbury and Atwood).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 338.—Moraine with outwash apron in front, the\r\nlatter in part eroded by a river. Westergötland, Sweden (after H.\r\nMunthe).]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 339.—Fosse between an outwash plain (in the foreground) and the\r\nmoraine, which rises to the left in the middle distance. Ann Arbor,\r\nMichigan.]\r\n\r\n=Kames.=—Within reëntrants or recesses of the ice margin the drift\r\ndeposits were especially heavy, so that high hills of hummocky surface\r\nhave been built up, which are described as _kames_. Most of the higher\r\ndrift hills have this origin. They rarely have any principal extension\r\nalong a single direction, but are composed in large part of assorted\r\nmaterials. In contrast with other portions of the morainal ridges they\r\nlack the prominent basins known as kettles. Other _kames_ are high\r\nhills of assorted materials not in direct association with moraines and\r\nbelieved to have been built up beneath glacier wells or mills (p. 278).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Outwash plains.=—Upon the outer margin of the moraine is generally\r\nto be found a plain of glacial “outwash” composed of sand or gravel\r\ndeposited by the braided streams (Fig. 308, p. 280) flowing from the\r\nglacier margin. Such plains, while notably flat (Fig. 338), slope\r\ngently away from the moraine. Between the outwash plain and the moraine\r\nthere is sometimes found a pit, or _fosse_ (Fig. 309, p. 281), where a\r\npart of the ice front was in part buried in its own outwash (Fig. 339).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 340.—View looking along an esker in southern Maine\r\n(after Stone).]\r\n\r\n=Pitted plains and interlobate moraines.=—Where glacial outwash is\r\nconcentrated within a long and narrow reëntrant, separating glacial\r\nlobes, strips of high plain are sometimes built up which overtop the\r\nother glacial deposits of the district. The sand and gravel which\r\ncompose such plains have a surface which is pitted by numerous deep and\r\nmore or less circular lakes, so that the term “pitted plain” has been\r\napplied to them. The surface of such a plain steadily rises toward its\r\nhighest point in the angle between the ice lobes. Though consisting\r\nalmost entirely of assorted materials, and built up largely without\r\nthe ice margins, such gently sloping pitted platforms are described as\r\n_interlobate moraines_. Upon a topographic map the course of such an\r\ninterlobate moraine may often be followed by the belts of small pit\r\nlakes (see Fig. 336).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 341.—Outline map showing the eskers of Finland trending\r\nsoutheasterly toward the festooned moraines at the margin of the ice.\r\nThe characteristic lakes of a glaciated region appear behind the\r\nmoraines (after J. J. Sederholm).]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 342.—Small sketch maps showing the relationships in size,\r\nproportions, and orientation of drumlins and eskers in southern\r\nWisconsin. The eskers are in solid black (after Alden).]\r\n\r\n=Eskers.=—Intra-morainal features, or those developed beneath the\r\nglacier but relatively near its margin, include the “serpentine kame”,\r\n_esker_, or, as it is called in Scandinavia, the _os_ (plural _osar_)\r\n(Fig. 340). These diminutive ridges have a width seldom exceeding a\r\nfew rods, and a height a few tens of feet at most, but with slightly\r\nsinuous undulations they may be followed for tens or even hundreds of\r\nmiles in the general direction of the local ice movement (Fig. 341).\r\nThey are composed of poorly stratified, thick-bedded sands, gravels,\r\nand “worked over” materials, and are believed to have been formed by\r\nsubglacial rivers which flowed in tunnels beneath the ice. Inasmuch as\r\nthe deposits were piled against the ice walls, the beds were disturbed\r\nat the sides when these walls disappeared, and the stratification,\r\nwhich was somewhat arched in the beginning, has been altered by\r\nsliding at both margins. As already stated, eskers have not a general\r\ndistribution within the glaciated area, but are often found in great\r\nnumbers at specially favored localities. Formed as they are beneath\r\nthe ice, it is believed that many have their materials redistributed\r\nso soon as uncovered at the glacier margin, because of the vigorous\r\ndrainage there. They are thus to be found only at those favored\r\nlocalities where for some reason border drainage is less active, or\r\nwhere the ice ended in a body of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Drumlins.=—A peculiar type of small hill likewise found behind the\r\nmarginal moraine in certain favored districts has the form of an\r\ninverted boat or canoe, the long axis of which is parallel to the\r\ndirection of ice movement, as is that of the esker (Fig. 342). Unlike\r\nthe esker, this type of hill is composed of till, and from being\r\nfound in Ireland it is called a _drumlin_, the Irish word meaning a\r\nlittle hill (Fig. 343). Drumlins are usually found in groups more or\r\nless radial and not far behind the outermost moraine, to which their\r\nradiating axes are perpendicular. The manner of their formation is\r\ninvolved in some uncertainty, but it is clear that they have been\r\nformed beneath the margin of the glacier, and have been given their\r\nshape by the last glacier which occupied the district.\r\n\r\nThe mutual relationships of nearly all the molded features resulting\r\nfrom continental glaciation may be read from Fig. 344.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 343.—View of a drumlin, showing an opening in the\r\ntill. Near Boston, Massachusetts (after Shaler and Davis).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The shelf ice of the ice age.=—Shelf ice, such as we have become\r\nfamiliar with in Antarctica as a marginal snow-ice terrace floating\r\nupon the sea, no doubt existed during the ice age above the Gulf of\r\nMaine (see Fig. 324, p. 298), and perhaps also over the deep sea to the\r\nwestward of Scotland. Though the inland ice probably covered the North\r\nSea, and upon the American side of the Atlantic the Long Island Sound,\r\nboth these basins are so shallow that the ice must have rested upon the\r\nbottom, for neither is of sufficient depth to entirely submerge one of\r\nthe higher European cathedrals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 344.—Outline map of the front of the Green Bay lobe of the latest\r\ncontinental glacier of the United States.

The\r\nesker in its cross sections is much the same, though its serpentine\r\nextension may offer some variety of curvature when viewed from higher\r\nlevels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 345.—Character profiles referable to continental\r\nglacier.]\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING REFERENCES FOR CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n General:—\r\n\r\n JAMES GEIKIE.

Whenever the valley was entered from the direction of its\r\ndivide, the effect of the advancing ice front has generally been to\r\nswell the waters of the river into floods to which the present streams\r\nbear little resemblance (Fig. 346). Because of the excessive melting,\r\nthis has been even more true of the ice retreat, but here _when the ice\r\nfront retired up the valley_ toward the divide. A sufficiently striking\r\nexample is furnished by the Wabash, Kaskaskia, Illinois, and other\r\nstreams to the southward of the divide which surrounds the basin of the\r\nGreat Lakes (Fig. 347).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 347.—Broadly terraced valleys outside the divide of the St.\r\nLawrence basin, which remain to mark the floods that issued from the\r\nlatest continental glacier during its retreat (after Leverett).]\r\n\r\nWherever the relief was small there occurred in the immediate vicinity\r\nof the ice front a temporary diversion of the streams by the parallel\r\nmoraines, so that the currents tended to parallel the ice front. This\r\ntemporary diversion known as “border drainage” was brought to a close\r\nwhen the partially impounded waters had, by cutting their way through\r\nthe moraines, established more permanent valleys (Fig. 348).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Temporary lakes due to ice blocking.=—Whenever, on the contrary, the\r\nadvancing ice front entered a valley from the direction of its mouth,\r\nor a _retreating ice front retired down the valley_, quite different\r\nresults followed, since the waters were now impounded by the ice front\r\nserving as a dam. Though the histories of such blocking of rivers\r\nare often quite complex, the principles which underlie them are in\r\nreality simple enough. Of the lakes formed during advancing hemicycles\r\nof glaciation, and of all save the latest receding hemicycle, no\r\nsatisfactory records are preserved, for the reason that the lake\r\nbeaches and the lake deposits were later disturbed and buried by the\r\noverriding ice sheets. We have, however, every reason to suppose that\r\nthe histories of each of these hemicycles were in every way as complex\r\nand interesting as that of the one which we are permitted to study.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 348.—Border drainage about the retreating ice front south of Lake\r\nErie. The stippled areas are the morainal ridges and the hachured bands\r\nthe valleys of border drainage (after Leverett).]\r\n\r\nAs an introduction to the study of the ice-blocked lakes of North\r\nAmerica, and to set forth as clearly as may be the fundamental\r\nprinciples upon which such lakes are dependent, we shall consider\r\nin some detail the late glacial history of certain of the Scottish\r\nglens, since their area is so small and the relief so strong that\r\nrelationships are more easily seen; it is, so to speak, a pocket\r\nedition of the history of the more extended glacial lakes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 349.—The “parallel roads” of Glen Roy in the southern highlands\r\nof Scotland (after Jamieson).]\r\n\r\n=The “parallel roads” of the Scottish glens.=—In a number of\r\nneighboring glens within the southern highlands of Scotland there are\r\nfound faint terraces upon the glen walls which under the name of the\r\n“parallel roads” (Fig. 349) have offered a vexed problem to scientists.\r\nOf the many scientists who long attempted to explain them, though in\r\nvain, was Charles Darwin, the father of modern evolution. He offered it\r\nas his view that the “roads” were beaches formed at a time when the sea\r\nentered the glens and stood at these levels. When, however, Jamieson’s\r\nstudies had discovered their true history, Darwin, with a frankness\r\ncharacteristic of some of the greatest scientists, admitted how far\r\nastray he had been in his reasoning. Let us, then, first examine the\r\nfacts, and later their interpretation. The map of Fig. 350 will suffice\r\nto set forth with sufficient clearness the course of the several\r\n“roads.” These “roads” are found in a number of glens tributary to\r\nLoch Lochy, and of the three neighboring valleys, Glen Roy has three,\r\nGlen Glaster two, and Glen Spean one “road.” The facts of greatest\r\nsignificance in arriving at their interpretation relate to their\r\nelevations with reference to the passes at the valley heads, their\r\nabrupt terminations down-valleyward, and the morainic accumulations\r\nwhich are found where they terminate. The single “road” of Glen Spean\r\nis found at an elevation of 898 feet, a height which corresponds to\r\nthat of the pass or col at the head of its valley and to the lowest of\r\nthe “roads” in both Glens Glaster and Roy. Similarly the upper of the\r\ntwo “roads” in Glen Glaster is at the height of the pass at its head\r\n(1075 feet) and corresponds in elevation to the middle one of the three\r\n“roads” in Glen Roy. Lastly, the highest of the “roads” in Glen Roy is\r\nfound at an elevation of 1151 feet, the height of the col at the head\r\nof the Glen. In the neighboring Glen Gloy is a still higher “road”\r\ncorresponding likewise in elevation to that of the pass through which\r\nit connects with Glen Roy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 350.—Map of Glen Roy and neighboring valleys of the Scottish\r\nhighlands with the so-called “roads” entered in heavy lines. Glens Roy,\r\nGlaster, and Spean have three “roads”, two “roads”, and one “road”,\r\nrespectively (after Jamieson).]\r\n\r\nTo come now to the explanation of the “roads”, it may be said at\r\nthe outset that they are, as Darwin supposed, beach terraces cut by\r\nwaves, not as he believed of the ocean, but of lakes which once filled\r\nportions of the glens when glaciers proceeding from Ben Nevis to the\r\nsouthwestward were blocking their lower portions. The several episodes\r\nof this lake history will be clear from a study of the three successive\r\nidealistic diagrams in Fig. 351.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 351.—Three successive diagrams to set forth in\r\norder the late glacial lake history of the Scottish glens.]\r\n\r\nTo derive the principles underlying this history, it is at once seen\r\nthat _all changes are initiated by the retirement of the ice front to\r\nsuch a point that it unblocks for the waters of a lake an outlet that\r\nis lower than the one in service at the time_. This is the principle\r\nwhich explains nearly all episodes of glacial lake history. Thus, when\r\nthe ice front had retired so as to open direct connections between Glen\r\nRoy and Glen Glaster, the col at the head of Glen Roy was abandoned as\r\nan outlet, and the waters fell to the level fixed for Glen Glaster.\r\nA still further retirement at last opened direct connection between\r\nGlen Glaster and Glen Spean, so that the lake common to Glens Glaster\r\nand Roy fell to the level of the col which was the outlet of the Spean\r\nvalley at the time. This stage continued until the ice front had\r\nretired so far that the waters drained naturally down the river Spean\r\nto Loch Lochy and thence to the ocean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 352.—Harvesting time on the fertile floor of the\r\nglacial Lake Agassiz (after Howell).]\r\n\r\nOnly in their far grander scale and in the lesser relief of the\r\nland over which they formed, do the complex histories of the great\r\nice-blocked lakes of North America differ from these little valley\r\nlakes whose beaches may be visited and the relationships worked out,\r\nthanks to Jamieson, in a single day’s strolling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 353.—Map of Lake Agassiz (after Upham).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The glacial Lake Agassiz.=—The grandest of the temporary lakes\r\nreferable to blocking by the continental glaciers of the ice age must\r\nbe looked for in the largest valleys that lay within the territory\r\ninvaded and _which normally drain toward the retiring ice front_.\r\nIn North America these rivers are the Red River of the North in\r\nMinnesota, the Dakotas, and Manitoba; and the St. Lawrence River\r\nsystem. To the ice dam which lay across the Red River valley we owe the\r\nfertility of that vast plain of lake deposits where is to-day the most\r\nintensive wheat farming of the northwest (Fig. 352). Lakes Winnipeg,\r\nWinnipegoosis, and Manitoba, and the Lake of the Woods, are all that\r\nnow remain of this greatest of the glacial lakes, which in honor of\r\nthe distinguished founder of the glacial theory has been called Lake\r\nAgassiz (Fig. 353). With their natural outlet blocked by the ice in\r\nnorthern Manitoba and Keewatin, the waters of the Red were swollen by\r\nmelting from the retiring glacier and spread over a vast area before\r\nfinding a southern outlet along the course of the present Lake Traverse\r\nand the valley of the Minnesota River. Along this route there flowed a\r\nmighty flood which carved out a broad valley many times too large for\r\nthe Minnesota, its present occupant, and this giant prehistoric river\r\nhas been called the Warren River (Fig. 354).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 354.—Map of the southern end of the Lake Agassiz basin, showing\r\nthe position of some of the beaches and the outlet through the former\r\nWarren River (after Upham).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 355.—Narrows of the Warren River below Big Stone\r\nLake, where it passed between jaws of hard granite and gneiss (after\r\nUpham).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 356.—Map of the valley of the Warren River in the vicinity of\r\nMinneapolis, with the young valley of the Mississippi entering it at\r\nFort Snelling (after Sardeson).]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to follow this ancient waterway and to discover\r\nthat, like our normal, present-day streams, it was held up in narrows\r\nwherever outcroppings of harder rock had constricted its channel\r\n(Fig. 355). The upper end of the Warren River valley is now occupied\r\nby the long and relatively narrow Lakes Traverse and Big Stone, each\r\nthe result of blocking by delta deposits where a tributary stream\r\nhas emerged into the valley, but this gigantic channel continues\r\ndown to and beyond Minneapolis, occupied as far as Fort Snelling\r\nby the Minnesota River—a mere pygmy compared to its predecessor.\r\nTo the earnest student of glacial geology there can be few sights\r\nmore impressive than are obtained by standing at Fort Snelling, just\r\nabove the confluence of the Minnesota and the Mississippi rivers, and\r\nsurveying first the steep and narrow valley of the Mississippi above\r\nthe junction,—a stream fitted to its valley for the simple reason that\r\nit has carved it,—and then gazing up and down that broad valley in\r\nwhich the great Warren River once flowed majestically to the sea, now\r\nthe bed of the Minnesota above the Fort and of the Mississippi below it\r\n(Fig. 356).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 357.—Portion of the Herman quadrangle of Minnesota, showing the\r\nposition of the Herman beach on the shore of the former Lake Agassiz.\r\nThe lake basin is to the left, and the pitted morainal deposits appear\r\nto the right (U. S. G. S.).]\r\n\r\nJust as the “parallel roads” of Glen Roy, roads in name only, are the\r\nbeaches of earlier glacial lake stages, so in Lake Agassiz we have\r\nparallel beaches of the barrier type which are often roads in fact as\r\nwell as in name, and which mark the stages of successive lakes within\r\nthis vast basin. The Herman beach, corresponding to the highest level\r\nof the lake, is thus a sharp topographic boundary between lake deposits\r\nand morainal accumulations, and is further itself a well-marked\r\ntopographic feature composed of wave-washed and hence well-drained\r\nmaterials (Fig. 357). Farmers of the district have been quick to\r\nrealize that these level and slightly elevated ridges lack the clay\r\nwhich would render them muddy in the wet seasons, and are thus ideally\r\nadapted for roads. They have in many sections been thus used over long\r\nstretches and are known as the “ridge roads.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=Episodes of the glacial lake history within the St. Lawrence\r\nvalley.=—Within this great drainage basin it has apparently been\r\npossible to read the records of each stage in the latest lake\r\nhistory—complex as this has been. We have only to recall the lake\r\nstages cited from the Scottish glens and remember that each new stage\r\nwas begun in a retirement of the glacier front which unblocked an\r\noutlet of lower level than the last. This sequence might, however,\r\nhave been varied by a temporary readvance of the ice, as indeed once\r\noccurred in the Huron-Erie lobe of the great North American glacier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 358.—The continental glacier of North America in an early stage\r\nof its recession, when it covered the entire St. Lawrence drainage\r\nbasin. The dashed line is the approximate position of the divide (based\r\non a map by Goldthwait).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 359.—Outline map of the early Lake Maumee, with the bordering\r\nmoraine and the water-laid moraine remaining on the site of the former\r\nice cliff.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The crescentic lakes of the earlier stages.=—So long as the glacier\r\ncovered the entire drainage basin of the St. Lawrence River system, all\r\nwater was freely drained away by streams which flowed _away from_ the\r\nice front (Fig. 358). So soon, however, as at any point the front had\r\nretired behind the divide, impounding of the waters must locally have\r\noccurred. Lakes of this type are to-day to be seen in Greenland and\r\nin the southern Andes; and though upon a diminutive scale, some idea\r\nof their aspect may be obtained from the appearance of the Märjelen\r\nLake of Switzerland, here blocked by a mountain glacier (Fig. 446, p.\r\n411). Within all areas of small relief, such as the prairie country\r\nsurrounding the present Laurentian lakes, the earlier and smaller\r\nstages of such ice-blocked lakes are generally crescentic in outline.\r\nThis is because a moraine in most cases forms the land margin of the\r\nlake, and because the ice cliff upon the opposite border, although\r\nsomewhat straightened, as a consequence of wave-cutting and iceberg\r\nformation, still retains the convex outlines characteristic of ice\r\nlobes (Fig. 359).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 360.—Map to show the first stages of the\r\nice-dammed lakes within the St. Lawrence basin (after Leverett and\r\nTaylor).]\r\n\r\nWithin each of the Great Lake basins a crescentic lake early appeared\r\nat that end of the depression which was first uncovered by the\r\nglacier: Lake Duluth in the Superior basin, Lake Chicago in the\r\nMichigan basin, and Lake Maumee in the Huron-Erie basin (Fig. 360).\r\n\r\nWe may now, with profit, trace the successive episodes of the glacial\r\nlake history, considering for the earlier stages those changes which\r\noccurred within the Huron-Erie basin, since, these are in essential\r\nrespects like those of the Michigan and Superior basins, although\r\nworked out in greater detail. Lake Chicago must, however, be brought\r\ninto consideration, since in all save the earliest and the later\r\nstages, the waters from the Huron-Erie depression were discharged\r\nthrough the Grand River into this lake and thence by the so-called\r\n“Chicago outlet” into the Mississippi (plate 20 A).\r\n\r\n\r\n=The early Lake Maumee.=—The area, outline, and outlet of this lake\r\nare indicated upon Fig. 360. Its ancient beaches have been traced, as\r\nwell as the water-laid moraine beneath its former ice cliff; and no\r\nobservant traveler who should take his way down the ancient outlet\r\nfrom Fort Wayne, Indiana, past the town of Huntington, could fail to\r\nbe impressed by its size, suggesting as it does the great volume of\r\nwater which must once have flowed along it. Now a channel a mile or\r\nmore in width, its bed for the twenty-five miles between Fort Wayne\r\nand Huntington may be seen from the tracks of the Wabash Railway as a\r\nseries of swamps merely, while at Huntington the Wabash river enters by\r\na young V-shaped valley at the side, much as the Mississippi emerges\r\ninto the old channel of the Warren River at Fort Snelling, Minnesota\r\n(see p. 327).\r\n\r\nThe Huron River of southern Michigan, which now discharges into Lake\r\nErie, then found its lower course blocked by the glacier and was thus\r\ncompelled to find a southerly directed channel now easily followed to\r\nthe northern horn of the crescent of Lake Maumee.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The later Lake Maumee.=—When the ice lobe had retired its front\r\nsufficiently, an outlet lower than that at Fort Wayne was uncovered\r\npast the city of Imlay, Michigan, into the Grand River, and thence\r\nthrough Lake Chicago and its outlet into the Mississippi. This old\r\noutlet south of Chicago follows the course of the present Drainage\r\nCanal and the line of the Chicago & Alton Railway. The traveler\r\njourneying southward by train from Chicago has thus the opportunity of\r\nobserving first the beaches of the former lake, and then the several\r\nchannels which were joined in the main outlet at the station of Sag\r\n(plate 20 A).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 361.—Outline map of the later Lake Maumee and of\r\nits “Imlay outlet” to Lake Chicago (after Leverett).]\r\n\r\nIn this stage of our history Lake Maumee pushed a shrunk arm up past\r\nthe site of Ypsilanti in Michigan (Fig. 361), the well-marked beach\r\nbeing found on Summit Street opposite the State Normal College. The\r\nHuron River, which in the first lake stage had followed the valley now\r\noccupied by the Raisin River southward into Indiana, now discharged\r\ndirectly into a bay upon this arm of Lake Maumee, and so formed a delta\r\nat Ann Arbor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 362.—Outline map of Lakes Whittlesey and Saginaw\r\n(after Leverett).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 363.—Map of the glacial Lake Warren, the last of the lakes in the\r\nHuron-Erie basin, which discharged through the “Grand River outlet”\r\ninto the Mississippi (after Leverett).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lakes Arkona and Whittlesey.=—The ice front in the Huron-Erie basin\r\nnow retired so far that the impounded waters, instead of following\r\nthe more direct “Imlay outlet” to the Grand, passed at a lower level\r\ncompletely around “the thumb” of Michigan into the Saginaw basin.\r\nMeanwhile a crescent-shaped lake had developed in that basin, so that\r\nnow the waters of the Maumee basin were joined to those in the Saginaw\r\nbasin as a common lake, just as the lowering of the waters in Glen Roy\r\ncaused a union with those of Glen Glaster in the example cited for\r\nillustration. Our records of this third North American lake stage,\r\nreferred to as Lake Arkona, are however most imperfect, for the reason\r\nthat it was followed by a readvance of the ice front which closed the\r\npassage around “the thumb” and raised the level of the waters until\r\nan outlet was found past the town of Ubly at a lower level than the\r\n“Imlay outlet.” When the waters of a lake are thus rising, strong beach\r\nformations result, and those of this stage, which is known as the Lake\r\nWhittlesey stage, are much the strongest that are found within the\r\nHuron-Erie basin. Traced for some three hundred miles entirely around\r\nthe southern and western margins of Lake Erie, this beach is for much\r\nof the distance the famous “ridge road” (Fig. 362).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lake Warren.=—As the ice advance which had produced Lake Whittlesey\r\ncame to an end, the normal recession was resumed and a lake once more\r\nformed as a body common to the Saginaw and Erie basins. This lake,\r\nknown as Lake Warren, extended a shrunk arm far eastward along the ice\r\nfront into western New York, though it was still blocked from entering\r\nthe great Mohawk valley (Fig. 363).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 364.—Map of the Glacial Lake Algonquin (after\r\nLeverett).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lakes Iroquois and Algonquin.=—It must be evident that toward the\r\nclose of the Lake Warren stage a profound change was imminent—a\r\ntransfer of the glacial waters from their course to the Mississippi\r\nand the Gulf to the trench which crosses New York State and enters the\r\nAtlantic. So soon as the ice front had retired sufficiently to lay\r\nbare the bed of the Mohawk, an outlet was found by this route and its\r\ncontinuation down the Hudson valley to the sea. The Lake Ontario basin\r\nnow became occupied by a considerably larger water body known as Lake\r\nIroquois, and the three upper lakes, then joined as Lake Algonquin,\r\ndischarged their combined waters into Lake Iroquois at first through a\r\ngreat channel now strongly marked across Ontario in the course of the\r\nTrent River and Lake Simcoe, the so-called “Trent outlet.” At this time\r\na smaller Lake Erie probably occupied the basin of that lake, and later\r\nthe Trent outlet was abandoned for the Port Huron outlet (Fig. 364).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 365.—Outline map of the Nipissing Great Lakes with\r\ntheir outlet past North Bay into the Champlain Sea.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Nipissing Great Lakes.=—We have now followed the ice front\r\nstep by step in its retreat across the valley of the St. Lawrence\r\nsystem. The successive unblocking of outlets offers but one further\r\npossibility—the opening of the French River-Nipissing Lake-Ottawa\r\nRiver, or “North Bay outlet.” Though not so to-day, the bed of this\r\nancient channel was then much lower than that of the “Mohawk outlet”,\r\nand so soon as the glacier had in its retreat uncovered this northern\r\nchannel, the waters of the upper lakes discharged through it past the\r\nsite of Ottawa and into an arm of the sea which then occupied the lower\r\nSt. Lawrence valley and has been called the Champlain Gulf or Sea\r\n(Fig. 365). The level of the waters was lowered and the area of the\r\nlakes correspondingly reduced.\r\n\r\nThe reader who has had no opportunity to observe these ancient channels\r\nwhich carried the swollen waters of the former glacier lakes, will find\r\nit interesting to consider that every one of them has been fixed upon\r\nby engineers for improvement as artificial waterways. Thus we have the\r\nIllinois Drainage Canal and projected ship canal along the “Chicago\r\noutlet”, the projected Mississippi-Lake Erie Canal along the “Fort\r\nWayne outlet”, the Grand River canal project to connect Lake Michigan\r\nand Saginaw Bay along the course of the “Grand River outlet”, the\r\nTrent Canal along the “Trent outlet”, the Erie Canal along the “Mohawk\r\noutlet”, and, lastly, the proposed Georgian Bay ship canal to the ocean\r\nalong the “North Bay” or “Nipissing outlet.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=Summary of lake stages.=—We have omitted in this summary of late lake\r\nhistory in the Laurentian basin all the less important lake stages,\r\nincluding some of a transitional nature which were represented by\r\nbeaches and outlets easily traced to-day. This is because it is an\r\noutline only which it seems best to present, and the episodes of this\r\nabridged history may be tabulated as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nEPISODES OF GLACIAL LAKE HISTORY\r\n\r\n  MISSISSIPPI DRAINAGE\r\n\r\n  Lake Maumee (early), Fort Wayne outlet.\r\n  Lake Maumee (late), Imlay City outlet.\r\n  Lake Arkona, “thumb” outlet.\r\n  Lake Whittlesey (with readvance of glacier), Ubly outlet.\r\n  Lake Warren, “thumb” outlet.\r\n\r\n  ATLANTIC DRAINAGE\r\n\r\n  Lakes Iroquois and Algonquin (early), Trent and Mohawk outlets.\r\n  Lakes Iroquois and Algonquin (late), Port Huron and Mohawk outlets.\r\n  Nipissing Great Lakes, North Bay outlet.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Permanent changes of drainage affected by the glacier.=—While the\r\nlake history which we have sketched is made up of episodes which\r\nendured only while the ice front lay between certain stations upon its\r\nretreat, there were none the less brought about the profoundest of\r\npermanent modifications in the drainage of the region. It is possible\r\nto restore upon maps in part only the preglacial drainage of the north\r\ncentral states, but we know at least that it was as different as may be\r\nfrom that which we find to-day. The Missouri and the Ohio take their\r\ncourses to-day along the margin of the glaciated area as an inheritance\r\nfrom the border drainage of the ice age. Within the glaciated regions\r\nrivers have in many cases been compelled by morainal obstructions to\r\nenter upon new courses, or even to travel in the opposite direction\r\nalong their former channels. In districts of considerable relief these\r\ndiversions have sometimes caused the streams to plunge over the walls\r\nof deep valleys, and it may truthfully be said that we owe much of our\r\nmost beautiful scenery in part to the carving and molding of glaciers,\r\nbut especially to the cascades and waterfalls directly due to their\r\ninterference with drainage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 366.—Probable preglacial drainage of the upper Ohio region (after\r\nChamberlin and Leverett).]\r\n\r\nMany diversions or reversals of former drainage lines, through the\r\ninfluence of the continental glacier, are at once suggested by\r\nthe abnormal stream courses, which appear upon our maps, and the\r\ncorrectness of these suggestions may often be confirmed by very simple\r\nobservations made upon the ground. The map of Fig. 366 shows how\r\ndifferent was the preglacial drainage of the upper Ohio region from\r\nthat of to-day.\r\n\r\nAn interesting additional example is furnished by the Still River\r\nwhich in Connecticut is tributary to the Farmington, and is no less\r\nremarkable for its abnormal northerly course and sluggish current\r\nperpetuated in its name, than for the way in which it is joined to the\r\nFarmington system (Fig. 367 _A_). A careful study of the district has\r\nshown that the Still River was once a part of the Naugatuck and flowed\r\nsouthward toward Long Island Sound like other rivers of the district\r\n(Fig. 367 _B_). It possessed, however, an advantage in a narrow belt\r\nof softer rock along its course, and because of this advantage it\r\ncaptured a portion of one of the tributaries to the Farmington (Fig.\r\n367 _C_). The continental glacier later covered the region, and on its\r\nretreat laid down morainal obstructions directly across this river and\r\nalso at the head of the severed arm of the Farmington tributary (Fig.\r\n367 _D_). The now impounded waters found their lowest outlet near Sandy\r\nBrook, and in waterfalls and cascades the now reversed river falls one\r\nhundred feet to the bed of that stream. With the aid of the excellent\r\ntopographic maps which are now supplied by a generous government at a\r\nmerely nominal price, such bits of recent history may be read at many\r\nplaces within the glaciated region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 367.—Diagrams to illustrate the episodes in the recent history\r\nof the Still River tributary to the Farmington in Connecticut. _A_,\r\npresent drainage; _B_, early stage; _C_, after capture of a tributary\r\nto the Farmington; _D_, after blocking by morainal obstructions of the\r\nice age.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Glacial Lake Ojibway in the Hudson Bay drainage basin.=—When by\r\npassing over the “height of land” in northern Ontario the greatly\r\nreduced continental glacier had vacated the basin of St. Lawrence\r\ndrainage, it was in a position to impound those waters which normally\r\ndrained to Hudson Bay. The lake which then came into existence has been\r\ncalled Lake Ojibway and was the latest of the entire series. Though of\r\nbut recent discovery in a country till lately a trackless wilderness,\r\nits extension seems to have been that of the clay beds suited for\r\nfarming. The beaches and outlets remain to be mapped when the country\r\nhas been made more easily accessible.\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING REFERENCES FOR CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n Parallel roads of Glen Roy:—\r\n\r\n CHARLES DARWIN.

We know, at least, that\r\nboth in northern Europe and in North America areas which have undergone\r\ndepression during and elevation after the ice age, correspond closely\r\nto the regions which were ice covered. Wherever in these regions there\r\nwas high relief before the advent of the ice, river valleys were\r\ndrowned at the land margins and were also gouged out into troughs\r\nthrough erosion by the outlet tongues upon the margin of the ice sheet.\r\nSuch furrowed and half-submerged valleys have a characteristic U-shaped\r\nsection, so that their walls rise precipitously from the sea. From\r\ntheir typical occurrence in Scandinavian countries the name _fjord_ has\r\nbeen applied to them.\r\n\r\nIt is now no less clear that the removal of the ice blanket brought\r\nfrom the earth a relatively quick response in uplift, which began\r\nbefore the ice front had retired across the present international\r\nboundary of the United States, and that this uplift continued until the\r\nfinal disappearance of the ice. A far slower elevation of a somewhat\r\ndifferent nature has continued, even to the present day.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that at the time of their formation all shore lines\r\nreferable to the work of waves must have been horizontal, and hence\r\nany variations from a perfect level which they reveal to-day must\r\nindicate that a tilting movement of the ground has occurred since the\r\nwaters departed from their basins. We have thus provided for us in the\r\npositions of these ancient water planes, particularly because of their\r\nwide extent, a complete record the refinement of which is not easily\r\noverstated. Interpreting this record, we find that it was the uptilt\r\nof the land to the northward which brought the glacial lake history to\r\nan end and inaugurated the present system of St. Lawrence drainage. The\r\noutlet of the Nipissing Great Lakes is to-day more than a hundred feet\r\nabove the level of the outlet at Port Huron, where the upper lakes are\r\nnow discharging their waters, and this difference in level can only\r\nbe ascribed to an upward tilting of the land since the latest of the\r\nglacial lake stages.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The abandoned strands as they appear to-day.=—The traveler by steamer\r\nupon the upper lakes, as he comes within view of each rocky headland,\r\nmay note how the profile against the horizon is notched by a series of\r\nsteps or terraces (Fig. 368), and if he has followed the discussion in\r\nprevious chapters, he will suspect that these terraces mark the now\r\nabandoned shore lines which have come to their present position through\r\na series of uplifts of the ground accompanied by earthquake shocks. As\r\nhis steamer skirts the shore he may chance to note a cave within the\r\nrock cliff which represents the now elevated sea-arch of an ancient\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 368.—The notched rock headland of Boyer Bluff between Green Bay\r\nand Lake Michigan (after Goldthwait).]\r\n\r\nDisembarking from the steamer and traveling inland at any point where\r\nthe shores are high, the traveler is certain to come upon still more\r\nconvincing proofs of the ancient strands; perhaps in a storm beach of\r\nthe unmistakable “shingle”, half buried though it may be under dunes\r\nof newly drifted sand, or possibly at higher levels the highway has\r\nbeen cut through a shingle barrier as fresh and unmistakable as though\r\nformed upon the present shore. Sometimes it is the rock cliff and\r\nterrace, at other times barrier ridges of shingle, or, again, it is the\r\nsloping cliff and terrace cut in the drift deposits; but of whatever\r\nsort, if studied with proper regard to the topography of the district,\r\nthe evidence is clear and unmistakable.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The records of uplift about Mackinac Island.=—Nowhere are the records\r\nof the recent uplift of the lake region more easily read than about\r\nMackinac Island in the straits connecting Lake Michigan with Lake\r\nHuron. Approaching the island by steamer from St. Ignace, its profile\r\nupon the horizon is worthy of remark (Fig. 369). From a central crest\r\nbroken by minor irregularities and bounded on all sides by a cliff, the\r\nisland profile slopes gently away to a still lower cliff, below which\r\nis another terrace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 369.—View of Mackinac Island from the direction of St. Ignace.\r\nThe irregular central portion is the only part of the island that was\r\nnot submerged in Lake Algonquin. The terrace at its base is the old\r\nshore line of Lake Algonquin, and the lower terrace the strand of Lake\r\nNipissing (after a photograph by Taylor).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 370.—The “Sugar Loaf”, a stack near the shore of Lake Algonquin,\r\nas it is seen from the observatory upon Mackinac Island (after a\r\nphotograph by Taylor).]\r\n\r\nWhen we have reached the island and have climbed to the summit, we\r\nthere find the surface which is characteristic of erosion by running\r\nwater, whereas at lower levels are found the forms carved or molded\r\nby the action of waves. This central “island”, superimposed upon the\r\nlarger island, is all that rose above Lake Algonquin, the earliest of\r\nthe glacial lakes in this northern district; and as we look out from\r\nthe observatory upon the summit, it is easy to call up a picture of the\r\ncountry when the lake stood at the base of this highest cliff. To the\r\nnorthward one sees the “Sugar Loaf” rise out of a sea of foliage, as it\r\nformerly did from the waters of Lake Algonquin (Fig. 370). It is a huge\r\nstack near the former island shore. If we turn now to the southward and\r\ndirect our gaze toward the Fort, we encounter a veritable succession of\r\nbeach ridges formed of shingle and ranged like a series of waves within\r\nthe cleared space of the “Short Target Range” (Fig. 371). These ridges\r\nmark each a stage within a series of successive uplifts which have\r\nbrought the island to its present height.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 371.—View from the observatory upon Mackinac Island across the\r\n“Short Target Range” toward the Fort. Beach ridges appear in succession\r\nwithin the cleared space (after a photograph by Rossiter).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 372.—Notched stack of the Nipissing Great Lakes at\r\nSt. Ignace (after a photograph by Taylor).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 373.—Series of diagrams to illustrate the evolution of ideas\r\nconcerning the uplift of the lake region since the ice age. _A_,\r\nsimple northerly up-canting (Gilbert): _B_, northerly acceleration of\r\nthe up-canting (Spencer and Upham); _C_, northerly “feathering out”\r\nof beaches (Spencer and Upham); _D_, hinge, line of up-canting found\r\nwithin the lake region (Leverett); _E_, multiple and northwardly\r\nmigrating hinge lines of up-canting (Hobbs).]\r\n\r\nIf now we descend from our position and visit the “battlefield”, we\r\nfind there a great ridge of level crest, behind which the British\r\nforce was stationed in its defense of the island in 1812. Near by in\r\nthe woods is Pulpit Rock, a strikingly perfect stack of the Nipissing\r\nLake. Across the straits at St. Ignace is an even finer example of the\r\nnotched stack (Fig. 372). Other less prominent beaches, but all later\r\nthan the Nipissing Lakes, intervene between this level and the present\r\nshore to mark the stages in the continued uplift of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The present inclinations of the uplifted strands.=—It is not enough\r\nthat we should have recognized the marks of former shores now at\r\nconsiderable elevations above the existing lakes; if we are to know\r\nthe nature of the uplift, we must prepare accurate maps based upon\r\nmeasurements by precise leveling at many localities. Such methods are,\r\nhowever, of comparatively recent application in this field; and, as in\r\nthe investigation of so many other problems, the earlier observations\r\nwere largely of the nature of reconnaissances with the elevation of\r\nbeaches estimated by comparatively crude methods only. The evolution of\r\nideas concerning the uptilt has, therefore, been a gradual one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 374.—Map of the Great Lakes region to show isobases and hinge\r\nlines of uptilt. _a_, isobase of the Chicago outlet; _b_, main hinge\r\nline of the Lake Whittlesey beach (Leverett); _b^1_, hinge line of the\r\nLake Warren beach (Taylor); _c_, isobase of the Port Huron outlet; _d_,\r\nmain hinge line of highest Algonquin beach (Goldthwait); _e_, _f_,\r\n_g_, _h_, additional hinge lines of Algonquin beaches in Door County\r\npeninsula (Hobbs); _l_, isobase of the Lake Superior outlet for the\r\nAlgonquin beaches (Leverett): _m_, isobase of the same outlet for the\r\nNipissing beaches (Leverett).]\r\n\r\nIt was early observed that the beaches corresponding to a given\r\nlake stage were higher to the northward and northeastward, and the\r\nnatural conclusion from this was that the earth’s crust had here been\r\ncanted like a trap door (Fig. 373, _A_). As we are to see, this but\r\nhalf-correct assumption has led to a striking prophecy relating to\r\nfuture changes within the lake region which we now know to be without\r\nwarrant in the facts. Later it was learned that the uptilt of the lake\r\nbeaches is much accelerated to the northward (Fig. 373, _B_), and that\r\nnew beaches make their appearance from beneath others as we proceed in\r\nthis direction—there is a “feathering out” of beaches to the northward\r\n(Fig. 373, _C_).\r\n\r\n\r\n=The hinge lines of uptilt.=—Still later in the study of the region,\r\nit was learned that the axis or fulcrum about which the region has been\r\nuptilted, instead of lying to the southward of the lake district, as\r\nhad been assumed by Gilbert, lay within the region and about halfway up\r\nthe basin of Lake Michigan (Fig. 373, _D_, and Fig. 374). Similarly, in\r\nthe uptilt which followed the ice retreat in northern Europe a definite\r\nhinge line of movement has been discovered.\r\n\r\nLastly, it has been shown, as a result of the use of precise leveling\r\nmethods, that not one but several hinge lines of movement lie within\r\nthe region, and that the separate sections into which they divide the\r\narea are each in turn characterized by increased up-cant as we proceed\r\nto the northward (Fig. 373, _E_ and Fig. 374).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 375.—Series of idealistic diagrams to indicate the nature of the\r\nquick recovery of the crust by uplift in blocks unloaded of the ice in\r\nsuccession. A further and slower uptilt, added after the completion of\r\nthe first movement, is brought out in the last diagram (_b_´).]\r\n\r\nThe beaches of Lake Maumee, the earliest of the series of lakes within\r\nthe Huron-Erie lobe and within the extreme southern portion of the\r\nGreat Lakes area, show only the slightest possible northerly uptilt,\r\nand the well-marked hinge line disclosed in the Whittlesey beach is\r\nevidence that the elastic recoil, as it were, from the weight of\r\nthe mantling glacier did not begin until after the draining of Lake\r\nWhittlesey. The determination by Taylor that there is a similar initial\r\nhinge line in the Warren beach—that this strand begins its uptilt some\r\nfifteen miles farther northeast than does the Whittlesey beach—is\r\none of the greatest importance in obtaining a correct idea of the\r\nrecent uplift; for it shows that the draining of Lake Whittlesey was\r\nfollowed by a period of quick uplift and seismic activity, that the\r\nstage of Lake Warren was one of comparative stability of the land,\r\nand, lastly, that the draining of Lake Warren was followed by a second\r\nperiod of rapid uplift and earthquake disturbance. The strongly marked\r\nhinge lines, additional to the initial one indicated for the Algonquin\r\nbeaches in the profiles by Goldthwait from the west shore of Lake\r\nMichigan, when considered in the light of this northeasterly migration\r\nof the still earlier hinge line in the southern district, are best\r\nexplained through the assumption of a succession of quick recoveries of\r\nthe crust by uplift, separated by periods of relative stability, and\r\nbrought on by the removal in turn of the ice burden from successive\r\nblocks of the shell which are separated by the several hinge lines\r\n(Fig. 375).\r\n\r\nThe elaborate study of erosion in the outlet of Lake Agassiz had\r\nindicated identical interruptions in the up-canting process for that\r\nbasin.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Future consequences of the continued uptilt within the lake\r\nregion.=—One of the most distinguished of American geologists, Dr.\r\nG. K. Gilbert, in order to determine whether the uptilt revealed by\r\ncanted beach lines is still in progress, carried out an elaborate\r\nstudy upon the gauge records preserved at the various gauging stations\r\nabout the Great Lakes. Upon the basis of these studies, he concluded\r\nthat the uplift continues, that the axes of equal uplift (isobases)\r\ntake their course about fifteen degrees north of west, so that the\r\nlines of greatest uptilt should be perpendicular to this direction,\r\nor fifteen degrees east of north. He further believed that the basin\r\nwas undergoing an up-cant in the simple manner of a trap door, the\r\nhinge of which lay to the southward of Chicago, and the study of the\r\ngauge records led him to believe that “the rate of change is such\r\nthat the two ends of a line one hundred miles long and lying in a\r\nsouth-southwest direction are relatively displaced four tenths of a\r\nfoot in one hundred years.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=Gilbert’s prophecy of a future outlet of the Great Lakes to the\r\nMississippi.=—The _natural_ rock sill, over which the waters of Lake\r\nChicago once flowed to the Mississippi, is to-day but eight feet above\r\nthe common mean level of Lakes Michigan and Huron, and if the tilting\r\nof the lake region were to continue upon Gilbert’s assumption of a\r\ncanting plane with the hinge of the movement to the south of Chicago, a\r\ntime must come when the “Chicago outlet” will again come into use and\r\nthe lakes once more drain to the Mississippi and the Gulf. Upon the\r\nbasis of his measurements, Gilbert ventured the prophecy that the first\r\nhigh-water discharge into the Mississippi should occur in from five\r\nhundred to six hundred years, and for continuous discharge in fifteen\r\nhundred years. In twenty-five hundred years Niagara Falls should at low\r\nwater stages be dry from this cause, and in thirty-five hundred years\r\nit should have become extinct.\r\n\r\nThis prophecy, emanating from a high scientific authority and relating\r\nto changes of such profound economic and commercial importance,\r\nhas been often quoted and has taken a firm hold upon the popular\r\nimagination. Obviously, it depends upon the now exploded theory that\r\nthe lake basin has been canted _as a plane_ and that the axis of uptilt\r\nlies somewhere to the southward of the lake region, or, in any event,\r\nto the southward of the present Port Huron outlet. We know to-day that\r\ninstead of being uniformly distributed over the entire lake region,\r\nthe uptilting goes on at a much higher rate within the northern areas,\r\nand that since the early stage of Lake Whittlesey the hinge line of\r\nuplift has been steadily migrating northward with the retreat of the\r\nice and is now well to the northward of the present outlet. There is,\r\ntherefore, no known uptilt of the district which separates the present\r\nfrom the former Chicago outlet, and there is no apparent natural\r\ncause which should result in the reoccupation of the old outlet to\r\nthe Mississippi. The prophecy must be regarded as one that has been\r\noutgrown with the progress of science.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Geological evidences of continued uplift.=—It has recently been\r\nclaimed, on the basis of a reëxamination of Gilbert’s study of the\r\nlake gauge records, that his methods are open to serious criticism and\r\nthat in reality the figures afford no evidence of continued uplift\r\nof the region. However this may be, there are not lacking geological\r\nevidences which do not admit of doubt, and these are in a striking way\r\nconfirmatory of the latest conclusions upon the manner of the recent\r\nuplift.\r\n\r\nIf our conclusions have been correct, the several lake basins should\r\nnow be behaving in different ways as regards the changes upon\r\ntheir shores. If it is true that the lines of greatest uptilt run\r\nnorth-northeasterly, there should be, speaking broadly, a “spilling\r\nover” of waters upon the south-southwesterly shores and a laying bare\r\nof the north-northeasterly shore terraces of the basins. This should,\r\nhowever, be true only of basins whose outlets are to the northeastward\r\nof the existing main hinge line of uptilt. Lake Huron, having its\r\noutlet at the southern margin of its basin, should not have its waters\r\nencroaching upon the southern shore, for the simple reason that any\r\ncontinued uptilt of the basin can only have the effect of pouring more\r\nwater through the outlet. Lake Michigan and Saginaw Bay, which are\r\narms of the Huron basin, ought, however, to become flooded upon their\r\nsouthern shores, _were it not that the hinge line of uptilt to-day lies\r\nto the northward of the outlet at Port Huron, and, further, that the\r\ntwo connecting channels still have their beds lower than the sill of\r\nthe outlet channel_. Now the evidence goes to show that no encroachment\r\nof waters is occurring upon the Chicago shore of Lake Michigan, and\r\nalthough the shores of Saginaw Bay are so excessively flat as to reveal\r\nslight changes of level by large migrations of the strand, yet the\r\nancient meander posts fixed by the early surveys are still found near\r\nthe water’s edge.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Drowning of southwestern shores of Lakes Superior and Erie.=—Within\r\nthe basins occupied by Lakes Superior and Erie, a wholly different\r\ncondition is found. In each case the outlet is found to the\r\nnortheastward (Fig. 374, p. 345), and the northwesterly trend of the\r\nisobases from these outlets is responsible for a continued elevation\r\nfrom uptilt of the outlets with reference to the western and southern\r\nshores. In consequence, the waters are encroaching upon these shores,\r\nand rivers which there enter the lake are drowned at their mouths, with\r\nthe formation of estuaries. Upon Lake Superior these changes are very\r\nmarked near Duluth and particularly in the St. Louis River, within\r\nwhich, since the early treaty with the Indians, certain rapids have\r\ndisappeared and submerged trunks of trees are now found in the channel\r\nof the river. As far east as Ontonagon essentially the same conditions\r\nare found.\r\n\r\nUpon the shores within the Porcupine Mountain district, the waters are\r\nclearly rising. Here old cedar trees may be seen, in some cases dead\r\nbut still upright and standing in from six to eight inches of water a\r\nnumber of feet out from the present shore, while others near the shore,\r\nbut upon the land and still living, are washed by the waves, and losing\r\ntheir lower bark in consequence. An old road along the shore has had to\r\nbe abandoned because of the encroaching water.\r\n\r\nUpon the opposite or northeastern shore of the lake, on the other hand,\r\nthe land is everywhere rising out of the water, and the waves are now\r\nbuilding storm beaches well out upon the wave-cut terrace. Here the\r\nstreams, instead of forming estuaries by drowning, drop down in rapids\r\nto the level of the lake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 376.—Portion of the Inner Sandusky Bay, to afford a comparison of\r\nthe shore line of 1820 with that of to-day (after Moseley).]\r\n\r\nAt the southwestern margin of Lake Erie there is everywhere evidence of\r\na rapid encroachment by the water. In the caves of South Bass Island\r\nstalactites, which must obviously have formed above the lake level, are\r\nnow permanently submerged. It is, however, about Sandusky Bay upon the\r\nsouthwest shore that the most striking observations have been made.\r\nMoseley has collected historical records of the killing of forest\r\ntrees through a submergence which was the result of an advance of the\r\nwater upon the shores. It seems to be proven from his studies that the\r\nwater is now rising in Sandusky Bay at a rate of about 2.14 feet per\r\ncentury. In Fig. 376 there is a comparison of the shores of the inner\r\nbay separated by an interval of about ninety years.\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING REFERENCES FOR CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n Uptilt in basin of Lake Agassiz:—\r\n\r\n WARREN UPHAM.

With the aid of borings\r\nmany of the now buried channels of the region have been followed out,\r\nand in a later paragraph we shall refer to some of the stronger lines\r\nof the earlier drainage system. Before undertaking the study of Niagara\r\nhistory, it is essential that one become somewhat familiar with the\r\npresent topography in and about the Niagara gorge.\r\n\r\nBelow the present cataract the river flows through a deep gorge for\r\nabout seven miles before issuing at the Lewiston Escarpment (Fig. 381,\r\np. 355). This gorge has been cut in beds of rock sediments which dip\r\nat a gentle angle southward toward Lake Erie. The capping of the rock\r\nseries is a compact and relatively resistant limestone which is known\r\nas the Niagara limestone, beneath which there are alternating beds\r\nof shale with thinner limestone and sandstone. The plain formed by\r\nthe upper surface of the limestone capping terminates in the Lewiston\r\nEscarpment, which is transverse to the direction of the gorge and seven\r\nmiles distant below the Falls. The depth of the gorge varies markedly,\r\nthe above-water portion being represented at the upper end by the\r\nheight of the cataract, one hundred and sixty-five feet, while at its\r\nlower end near Lewiston it is twice that amount. Halfway down the gorge\r\na sharp turn is made at an angle of more than ninety degrees, and the\r\nupstream arm is extended to form a basin which contains the famous\r\nwhirlpool. This visible extension of the upper gorge is continued in a\r\nburied channel, the St. Davids Gorge, which extends to the escarpment,\r\nbroadening as it does so in the form of a trumpet. The materials which\r\nfill this earlier channel are notably coarse glacial deposits (Fig.\r\n389).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 377.—Ideal cross section of the Niagara gorge to show the\r\nmarginal terrace.]\r\n\r\nDirectly above the whirlpool the Niagara gorge is first contracted, but\r\nalmost immediately swells out into the form of a sausage, which under\r\nthe name of the Eddy Basin extends to the constricted channel occupied\r\nby the Whirlpool Rapids. This Gorge of the Whirlpool Rapids extends to\r\nand a little above the railroad bridges, where it again suddenly widens\r\nand deepens and with surprisingly uniform cross section now continues\r\nas far as the cataract. This uppermost section is known as the Upper\r\nGreat Gorge. About a mile below the whirlpool is that remarkable\r\nprojection into the gorge from the Canadian wall which is known as\r\nWintergreen Flats, below which and nearer the river are Fosters Flats.\r\nAlmost throughout its entire length the Niagara gorge is bordered on\r\neither side by a narrow and gently incurving terrace eroded below the\r\ngeneral level of the plain and meeting the gorge in a sharp angle (Fig.\r\n377).\r\n\r\nThe features immediately about the cataract show that the Falls are\r\nto-day in a condition which, so far as we know, has occurred but once\r\nbefore in their entire history—the waters of the river are divided\r\nunequally by an island, and for this reason, as we shall see, the\r\ncataract enters over the _side wall_ of the gorge instead of at its\r\n_end_ (Fig. 381), although the turning of the channel from this cause\r\nis combined with a bend of the river.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 378.—View of the bed of the Niagara River above the cataract,\r\nwhere water has been drained off in installing a power plant. Some\r\nseparated blocks of limestone are still in place (after J. W. Spencer).]\r\n\r\n=The drilling of the gorge.=—There appear to be two important\r\nprocesses which are responsible for the recession of the Falls, the\r\nrate of which is determined largely by the resistance of the limestone\r\ncapping and the tenacity of the looser shale beneath it. One of the\r\neroding processes operates from below and undermines the cap until\r\nthe unsupported cornice falls in blocks to the bottom of the gorge;\r\nthe other makes its attack directly from above, selecting for the\r\npurpose the lines of jointing of the rock which it widens by solution\r\nand corrasion until the included blocks are in so far separated that\r\nthey are torn out and go over the brink of the Falls (Fig. 378). This\r\nprocess of overhead attack in the powerful currents just above a\r\ncataract is even better illustrated by the Falls of St. Anthony near\r\nMinneapolis, which have had a similar history of recession to that of\r\nthe Niagara Falls (Fig. 379).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 379.—Falls of St. Anthony, looking westward from\r\nHennepin Island in 1851 (after N. H. Winchell, daguerreotype by Hessler\r\nof Chicago).]\r\n\r\nThe blocks of the capping limestone at Niagara Falls are to some\r\nextent fixed in size by the joint planes present in them, and as they\r\nfall to the bottom of the gorge, they promote or retard the further\r\nrecession of the Falls according as they can or cannot be moved about\r\nby the churning currents beneath the cataract. Of the retarding effect\r\nthere is an illustration in the accumulation of the blocks below the\r\nAmerican and the intermediate Luna Falls (plate 23 A), which the weaker\r\ncurrents upon the American side find too heavy to handle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 380.—Ideal section to show the nature of the drilling process\r\nbeneath the cataract.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 381.—Plan and section of the Niagara gorge, showing how in each\r\nsection the depth is proportional to the width, except in the lowest\r\nsection where subsequent river action of the normal type has modified\r\nthe bed of the channel (plan after Taylor and section after Gilbert).]\r\n\r\nThe Canadian Fall, with its much greater power, is an example of the\r\npromotion of recession through the churning about of the blocks at the\r\nbase of the cataract. We have here to do with a churn drill which bores\r\nits way into the bottom of the gorge with increasing radius of rotary\r\nmotion with each increase in volume of the falling water. Under this\r\nrotary churning the soft shales are torn out near the bottom and in\r\nsuccession the harder layers above until the capping is reached (Fig.\r\n380). The conditions appear now to be such that the effective work is\r\nlargely concentrated, as it usually has been, near the middle of the\r\nchannel; and so the gorge recedes with a margin of the earlier river\r\nbed remaining as a terrace on either side and extending to the former\r\nriver bank (Fig. 377).\r\n\r\nAs must have been noted, one peculiarity of the operation of the churn\r\ndrill beneath the cataract is that the depth of the gorge will bear\r\na direct proportion to its width, and if the volume of water has\r\nvaried during the process of recession, these changes in volume will be\r\nregistered in the width and also in the depth of that section of the\r\ngorge which was drilled at the time—the cross section of the gorge at\r\nany place is proportional to the volume of the water falling in the\r\ncataract which produced it, modified, however, by the competency to\r\nhandle the joint blocks of definite size (Fig. 381).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 382.—Comparison of a sketch of the Canadian Fall made with the\r\naid of a camera lucida in 1827 with a photograph taken from the same\r\nview point in 1895 (after Gilbert).]\r\n\r\n=The present rate of recession.=—There are various sketches, more or\r\nless accurate, made in the early part of the nineteenth century, and\r\nfrom the later period there are daguerreotypes, photographs, and maps,\r\nwhich refer especially to the Canadian Fall; and which, taken together,\r\nrender possible a comparison of the earlier with the later brinks. By\r\ncomparing the earliest with the recent, views it is seen at a glance\r\nthat the Falls are receding, and at a quite appreciable rate (Fig.\r\n382). A careful comparison of the maps made in 1842, 1875, 1886, 1890,\r\nand 1905 of the brink of the Canadian Fall (Fig. 383) indicates that\r\nfor the period covered the rate of recession has been about five feet\r\nper year, and similar studies made of the American Fall show that it\r\nhas been receding at the rate of only three inches per year, or one\r\ntwentieth the rate of the recession of the Canadian Fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 383.—Map to show the recession of the brink of the Canadian Fall,\r\nbased upon maps of different dates (after Gilbert).]\r\n\r\n=Future extinction of the American Fall.=—It is because of this many\r\ntimes more rapid recession of the Canadian Fall that the Niagara\r\ncataract, instead of lying athwart the gorge, enters it from its side.\r\nThe Canadian Fall is thus in reality swinging about the American, and\r\nthe time can already be roughly estimated when this more effective\r\ndrilling tool will have brought about a capture, so to speak, of the\r\nAmerican Fall through the cutting off of its water supply. It will then\r\nbe drained and left literally “high and dry”, an enduring witness to\r\nthe geological effect of an island in making an unequal division of the\r\nwaters for the work of two cataracts.\r\n\r\nAs already pointed out, the inefficiency of the American Fall as an\r\neroding agent is amply attested by the wall of blocks already appearing\r\nabove the water below it. The tourist who a thousand years hence pays\r\na visit to the Niagara cataract, provided the water flow is allowed to\r\nremain as it has been, will find above this rampart of blocks a bare\r\ncliff in part undermined, and surmounted by a nearly flat table surface\r\nwhich is cut off from the existing cataract by a higher section of the\r\ngorge (Fig. 384). It is quite likely that this table will furnish the\r\nmost satisfactory viewpoint of the future cataract of that date.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 384.—Comparison of the present with the future falls.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The captured Canadian Fall at Wintergreen Flats.=—What we have\r\npredicted for the future of the present American Fall will be the\r\nbetter understood from the study of a monument to earlier capture\r\nmade long before the upper section of the gorge had been cut or the\r\nwhirlpool had come into existence. The tables were then turned, for it\r\nwas a fall upon the Canadian side of the gorge that was captured by\r\none upon the American. The locality is known as Wintergreen Flats, or\r\nsometimes as Fosters Flats; though the first name properly applies to\r\na higher surface near the brink of the gorge, and Fosters Flats to a\r\nlower plain near the level of the river (see Fig. 381, p. 355). The\r\npeculiar topographic features at this locality are well brought out in\r\nGilbert’s bird’s-eye view of the locality (Fig. 385); in fact, in some\r\nrespects better than they appear to the tourist upon the ground, for\r\nthe reason that the abandoned channel and the Flats on the site of the\r\nsince undermined island are both heavily forested and so not easy to\r\ninclude in a single view. For one who has studied the existing cataract\r\nthis early monument is full of meaning. Standing, as one may, upon the\r\nvery brink of the former cataract, it is easy to call up in imagination\r\nthe grandeur of the earlier surroundings and to hear the thunder of the\r\nfalling water. A particularly vivid touch is added when, in digging\r\nover the sand about the great blocks of fallen limestone underneath\r\nthe brink, one comes upon the shells of an animal still living in the\r\nNiagara River, though only in the continual spray beneath the cataract.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 385.—Bird’s-eye view of the captured Canadian Fall at Wintergreen\r\nFlats, showing the section of the river bed above the cliff and the\r\nblocks of fallen Niagara limestone strewn over the abandoned channel\r\nbelow (after Gilbert).]\r\n\r\n=The Whirlpool Basin excavated from the St. Davids Gorge.=—It has\r\nalready been pointed out that a rock channel now filled with glacial\r\ndeposits extends from the Whirlpool Basin to the edge of the escarpment\r\nat St. Davids (Fig. 389, p. 363). In plan this buried gorge has a\r\ntrumpet form, being more than two miles wide at its mouth and narrowing\r\nto the width of the upper gorge before it has reached the Whirlpool.\r\nNear the Whirlpool it has been in part excavated by Bowman Creek,\r\nthus revealing walls that are well glaciated. Different opinions have\r\nbeen expressed concerning the origin of this channel, one being that\r\nit is the course either of a preglacial river or one incised between\r\nconsecutive glacial invasions; and another that it is a cataract gorge\r\ndrilled out between glacial invasions after the manner of the later\r\nNiagara gorge. In either case its contours have been much modified by\r\nthe later glacier or glaciers, whose work of planing, polishing, and\r\nwidening is revealed in the exposed surfaces; and it is not improbable\r\nthat a cataract has receded along the course of an earlier river valley.\r\n\r\nAs we shall see, there are facts which point rather clearly to an\r\nearlier cataract which ended its life immediately above the present\r\nWhirlpool. When the later Niagara cataract had receded to near the\r\nupper end of the Cove section, or near the present Whirlpool, the\r\nfalling water must have been separated from this older channel and its\r\nfilling of till deposits by only a thin wall of rock, and this must\r\nhave been constantly weakened as its thickness was further reduced.\r\n\r\nWhen this weakened dam at last gave way, it must have produced a\r\ndebacle grand in the extreme. It is hardly to be conceived that the\r\n“washout” of the ancient channel to form the Whirlpool Basin could\r\nhave occupied more than a small fraction of a day, though it is highly\r\nprobable that the broken rock partition below the Whirlpool was not\r\nimmediately removed entire. The mandible-like termination of the Eddy\r\nBasin immediately above the Whirlpool has led Taylor to believe that\r\nthe cataract quickly reëstablished itself at this point upon the last\r\nsite of the extinct St. Davids cataract. If reduced in power for a\r\nshort interval, as a result of the obstructions still remaining in the\r\nlately broken dam below the Whirlpool, the remarkable narrowing of the\r\ngorge at this point would be sufficiently accounted for.\r\n\r\nBeing compelled to turn through more than a right angle after it\r\nenters the Whirlpool Basin, the swift current of the Niagara River is\r\nforced to double upon itself against the opposite bank and dive below\r\nthe incoming current before emerging into the Cove section below the\r\nWhirlpool (Fig. 386).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 386.—Map of the Whirlpool Basin, showing the rock side walls\r\nlike those of the Niagara Gorge, and the drift bank which forms the\r\nnorthwest wall (after Gilbert).]\r\n\r\nIn tearing out the loose deposits which had filled this part of\r\nthe buried St. Davids Gorge, many bowlders of great size were left\r\nwhich slid down the slope and in time produced an armor about the\r\nlooser deposits beneath, so as to protect them and prevent continued\r\nexcavation. Thus it is found that the submerged northwestern wall\r\nof the basin is sheathed with bowlders large enough to retain their\r\npositions and so stop a natural process of placer outwashing upon a\r\ngigantic scale (Fig. 386).\r\n\r\n\r\n=The shaping of the Lewiston Escarpment.=—To understand the formation\r\nof the Lewiston Escarpment cut in the hard Niagara limestone, it is\r\nnecessary to consider the geology of a much larger area—that of the\r\nGreat Lakes region as a whole. To the north of the Lakes in Canada\r\nis found a most ancient continent which was in existence when all\r\nthe area to the southward lay below the waters of the ocean. In a\r\nperiod still very many times as long ago as the events we have under\r\ndiscussion, there were laid down off the shore of this oldland a series\r\nof unconsolidated deposits which, hardened in the course of time, and\r\nelevated, are now represented by the shales, sandstone, and limestone\r\nwhich we find, one above the other, in the Niagara gorge in the order\r\nin which they were laid down upon the ocean floor. The formations\r\nrepresented in the gorge are but a part of the entire series, for\r\nother higher members are represented by rocks about Lake Erie and even\r\nfarther to the southward. These strata, having been formed upon an\r\noutward sloping sea floor, had a small initial dip to the southward,\r\nand this has been probably increased by subsequent uptilt, including\r\nthe latest which we have so recently had under discussion. At the\r\npresent time the beds dip southward by an angle of less than four\r\ndegrees, or about thirty-five feet in each mile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 387.—Map to show the cuestas which have played so important\r\na part in fixing the boundaries of the Lake basins, and also the\r\nprincipal preglacial rivers by which they have been trenched (based\r\nupon a map by Grabau).]\r\n\r\nWhen the elevation of the land in the vicinity of this shore had\r\ncaused a recession of the waters, there was formed a coastal plain\r\non the borders of the oldland like that which is now found upon our\r\nAtlantic border between the Appalachians and the sea (Fig. 272, p.\r\n246). The rivers from the oldland cut their way in narrow trenches\r\nacross the newland, and because of the harder limestone formations,\r\ntheir tributaries gradually became diverted from their earlier courses\r\nuntil they entered the trunk stream nearly at right angles and produced\r\nthe type of drainage network which is called “trellis drainage.” It\r\nis characteristic of this drainage that few tributaries of the second\r\norder will flow up the natural slope of the beds, but on the contrary\r\nthese natural slopes are followed in the softer rock nearly at right\r\nangles again to the tributaries of the first order of magnitude (Fig.\r\n387). Thus are produced a series of more or less parallel escarpments\r\nformed in the harder rock and having at their base a lowland which\r\nrises gradually in the direction of the oldland until a new escarpment\r\nis reached in the next lower of the hard formations. Such flat-topped\r\nuplands in series with intermediate lowlands and separated by sharp\r\nescarpments are known as _cuestas_ (see p. 246), and the Lewiston\r\nEscarpment limits that formed in Niagara limestone (Figs. 387 and 388).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 388.—Bird’s-eye view of the cuestas south of Lakes Ontario and\r\nErie (after Gilbert).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Episodes of Niagara’s history and their correlation with those of\r\nthe Glacial Lakes.=—Of the early episodes of Niagara’s history, our\r\nknowledge is not as perfect as we could desire, but the later events\r\nare fully and trustworthily recorded. The birth of the Falls is to\r\nbe dated at the time when the ice front had here first retired into\r\nwhat is now Canadian territory, thus for the first time allowing the\r\nwaters from the Erie basin to discharge over the Lewiston Escarpment\r\ninto the basin of the newly formed Lake Iroquois (Fig. 364, p. 334).\r\nSince the level of Lake Iroquois was far above that of the present Lake\r\nOntario, the new-born cataract was not the equivalent in height of\r\nthe escarpment to-day. The Iroquois waters then bathed all the lower\r\nportion of the escarpment, so that the foot of the Fall was upon the\r\nborders of the Lake.\r\n\r\nIn order to interpret the history of the Niagara gorge, we must\r\nremember that the effective drilling of this gorge was in each stage\r\ndependent mainly upon the volume of water discharged from Lake Erie,\r\na large discharge being recorded by a channel drilled both wide\r\nand deep, while that produced by the discharge of a smaller volume\r\nwas correspondingly narrow and shallow. To-day the gorges of large\r\ncross section have, moreover, a relatively placid surface, whereas\r\nthrough the constricted sections the water of the river is unable to\r\npass without first raising its level at the upper end and under the\r\nhead thus produced rushing through under an increased velocity. The\r\nbest illustration of such a constricted section is the Gorge of the\r\nWhirlpool Rapids.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 389.—Sketch map of the greater portion of the Niagara Gorge to\r\nshow the changes in cross section in their relations to Niagara history\r\n(based upon a map by Taylor).]\r\n\r\nOur reading of the history should begin at the site of the present\r\ncataract, since the records of later events are so much the more\r\ncomplete and legible, and it should ever be our plan to proceed from\r\nthe clearly written pages to those half effaced and illegible.\r\n\r\nAs we have learned, the most abrupt change in the cross section of the\r\ngorge is found a little above the railroad bridges, where the Upper\r\nGreat Gorge is joined to the Gorge of the Whirlpool Rapids (Fig. 389).\r\nIn view of the remarkably uniform cross section of the Upper Great\r\nGorge, there is no reason to doubt that it has been drilled throughout\r\nunder essentially the same volume of water, and that its lower limit\r\nmarks the position of the former cataract when the waters from the\r\nupper lakes were transferred from the “North Bay Outlet” into the\r\npresent or “Port Huron Outlet” and Lake Erie. As the upper limit of the\r\nGorge of the Whirlpool Rapids thus corresponds to the closing of the\r\n“North Bay Outlet” and the extinction of the Nipissing Great Lakes, so\r\nits lower limit doubtless corresponds to the opening of that outlet and\r\nthe termination of the preceding Algonquin stage; for in the stage of\r\nthe Nipissing lakes the water of the upper lakes, as we have learned,\r\nreached the ocean through the northern outlet.\r\n\r\nMr. Frank Taylor, who has given much study to the problem of Niagaran\r\nhistory, believes that the Middle Great Gorge, comprising the Eddy\r\nBasin and the Cove section, represents the gorge drilling which\r\noccurred during the later stage of Lake Algonquin after the “Trent\r\nOutlet” had been closed and the waters of the upper lakes had been\r\nturned into the Erie Basin.\r\n\r\nSummarizing, then, the episodes of the lake and the gorge history are\r\nto be correlated as follows:—\r\n\r\n        GLACIAL LAKE                             NIAGARA GORGE\r\n\r\n Early Lakes Iroquois and Algonquin.

But men\r\npossess differences in strength and speed, and the same man is at some\r\ntimes more vigorous than at others, and so does not work at a uniform\r\nrate. The cataract of Niagara, charged with the pent-up energy of the\r\nwaters of all the Great Lakes, can rush its work as it is clearly\r\nunable to do at times when the greater part of this energy has been\r\ndiverted. Units of distance measured along the gorge are therefore too\r\nunreliable for our use, with the unique exception of the stretch from\r\nthe railroad bridges to the site of the present cataract, within which\r\nstretch the gorge cross sections are so nearly uniform as to indicate\r\nan approximation to continued application of uniform energy. This\r\nenergy we may actually measure in the existing cataract, and so fix\r\nupon a unit of time that can be translated into years.\r\n\r\nIn order to secure the normal rate of recession of this Upper Great\r\nGorge, we should add to the volume of water in the Canadian Fall that\r\nnow passing over the American; and for the reason that the blocks\r\nwhich fall from the cataract cornice and are the tools of the drilling\r\ninstrument approximate to a definite size fixed by their joint planes,\r\nthe effect of this added energy it is not easy to estimate. We may be\r\nsure, however, that the drilling action would be somewhat increased by\r\nthe junction of the two Falls, and thus are assured that the average\r\nrate of recession within the Upper Great Gorge has been somewhat in\r\nexcess of the five feet per year determined by Gilbert for the present\r\nCanadian Fall. The Upper Great Gorge is about two miles in length,\r\nand its beginning may thus be dated near the dawning of the Christian\r\nEra. The Whirlpool Gorge was cut when the ice vacated the North Bay\r\nOutlet in Canada, and still lay as a broad mantle over all northeastern\r\nCanada. For the earlier gorge and lake stages, the time estimates are\r\nhardly more than guesses, and we need not now concern ourselves with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The horologe of late glacial time in Scandinavia.=—A glacial\r\ntimepiece of somewhat different construction and of greater refinement\r\nhas been made use of in Scandinavia to derive the “geochronology\r\nof the last 12,000 years.” Instead of retreating over the land and\r\nimpounding the drainage as it did so, the latest continental glacier\r\nof Scandinavia ended below sea level, and as it retired, its great\r\nsubglacial river laid down a giant esker known as the Stockholm Os,\r\nwhich was bordered by a delta and fringed on either side by water-laid\r\nmoraines of the block type. These recessional moraines are upon the\r\naverage less than 1000 feet apart, and are believed to have each been\r\nformed in a single season. The delta deposits which surround the esker\r\nare of thin-banded clay, and as an additional uppermost band is found\r\noutside every moraine, these bands are also believed to represent each\r\nthe delta deposit of a single year. In studies extending over many\r\nyears, Baron de Geer, with the aid of a large body of student helpers,\r\nhas succeeded in completing a count of moraines and clay layers, and so\r\nin determining the time to be 12,000 years since the ice front of the\r\nlatest continental glacier lay across southern Sweden. The fertility\r\nof conception and the thoroughness of execution of this epoch-making\r\ninvestigation recommend its conclusion to the scientific reader.\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING REFERENCES FOR CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n G.

Sculpture by mountain glaciers,\r\ninstead of reducing surface irregularities and softening outlines,\r\nincreases the accent of the relief and produces the most sharply\r\nrugged topography that is known. In nearly all places where Alpinists\r\nresort for difficult rock climbing, mountain glaciers are to be seen,\r\nor the evidence for their former presence may be read in unmistakable\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Wind distribution of the snow which falls in mountains.=—Until quite\r\nrecently students of glaciation have concerned themselves but little\r\nwith the work of the wind in lifting and redistributing the snow after\r\nit has fallen. We have already seen that, for the continental glaciers,\r\nwind appears to be the chief transporting agent, if we except the\r\nmarginal lobes where glacier flow assumes large importance. In the case\r\nof mountain glaciers, also, we are to find that for the earlier stages\r\nparticularly wind is of the first importance as a redistributing agent.\r\nIn the higher levels snow is swept up from the ground by all high\r\nwinds, and does not find a resting place until it is dropped beneath an\r\neddy in some irregularity of the surface; and if the inherited surface\r\nbe relatively smooth, this will be found in most cases upon the lee of\r\nthe mountain crest.\r\n\r\nIn normal cases at least the inherited irregularities of the higher\r\nzones of mountain upland are the gentle depressions which develop at\r\nthe heads of streams. These become, then, the sites of snowdrifts that\r\nare augmented in size from year to year, though at first they melt away\r\nin the late summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 390.—Snowdrift hollowing its bed by nivation and\r\nbuilding a delta (at the left). Quadrant Mountain, Yellowstone National\r\nPark.]\r\n\r\n=The niches which form on snowdrift sites.=—Wherever a drift is\r\nformed, a process is set in operation, the effect of which is to hollow\r\nout and lower the ground beneath it, a process which has been called\r\n_nivation_. The drift shown in Fig. 390 was photographed in late summer\r\nat an elevation of some 9000 feet in the Yellowstone National Park.\r\nThe very gently sloping surface surrounding the drift is covered with\r\ngrass, but within a zone a few feet in width on the borders of the\r\ndrift no grass is growing, and in its place is found a fine brown soil\r\nwhich is fast becoming the prey of the moving water derived by melting\r\nof the drift. This is explained by the water permeating the crevices of\r\nthe rock and being rent by the nightly freezing. Farther from the drift\r\nthe ground is dry, and no such action is possible. With each succeeding\r\nspring the augmented drift as it melts carries all finely comminuted\r\nrock material down slopes beneath the snow to emerge at the lowest\r\nmargin and be there deposited in the form of a delta. By the operation\r\nof this process of nivation the higher parts of the drift site are\r\nlowered as deposition goes on upon the lower. The combined effect is\r\nthus to produce a _niche_ or faintly etched amphitheater upon the slope\r\nof the mountain (Fig. 391).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 391.—Amphitheater formed on a drift site in\r\nnorthern Lapland (after a photograph by G. von Zahn).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The augmented snowdrift moves down the valley—birth of the\r\nglacier.=—In still lower air temperatures the drifts enlarge with\r\neach succeeding year until they endure throughout the summer season.\r\nFrom this stage on, an increment of snow is left from each succeeding\r\nseason. No longer entirely wasted by melting, the time soon comes when\r\nthe upper snow layers will by their weight compress the lower into ice,\r\nand the mass will begin to creep down the slope along the course of the\r\ninherited valley. The enlarged snowdrift which feeds this ice stream is\r\ncalled the _névé_ or _firn_.\r\n\r\nAgainst the sloping cliff which had been shaped by nivation at the\r\nupper margin of the snowdrift, that snow which is not of sufficient\r\ndepth to begin a movement towards the valley separates from the moving\r\nportion, opening as it does so a cleft or crevasse parallel to the\r\nwall. This crack in the snow is called by its German name _Bergschrund_\r\nor _Randspalte_, and may perhaps be referred to as the marginal\r\ncrevasse (Fig. 392).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 392.—The marginal crevasse or Bergschrund on the highest margin\r\nof a glacier (after Gilbert).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The excavation of the glacial amphitheater or cirque.=—It has been\r\nfound that the marginal crevasse plays a most important rôle in the\r\nsculpture of mountains by glaciers, for the great amphitheater which\r\nis everywhere the collecting basin for the nourishment of mountain\r\nglaciers is not an inherited feature, but the handiwork of the ice\r\nitself. This was the discovery of Mr. W. D. Johnson, an American\r\ntopographer and geologist, who, in order to solve the problem of the\r\namphitheater allowed himself to be lowered into such a crevasse upon\r\nthe Mount Lyell glacier of the Sierra Nevadas in California.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 393.—Niches and cirques in the same vicinity in the Bighorn\r\nMountains of Wyoming. _A, A_, unmodified valleys; _B, B_, niches on\r\ndrift sites; _C, C_, cirques on small glacier sites (after map by F. E.\r\nMathes, U. S. G. S.).]\r\n\r\nLet down a distance of a hundred and fifty feet, he reached the bottom\r\nof the crack, and in a drizzling rain of thaw water stood upon a floor\r\ncomposed of rock masses in part dislodged from a wall which extended\r\nsome twenty feet upwards upon the cliff side of the crevasse. It was\r\nevident that the warm air of the day produced the thaw water which was\r\nconstantly dripping and which filled every crack and cranny of the rock\r\nsurface. With the sinking of the sun below the peaks the sudden chill,\r\nso characteristic of the end of the day in high mountains, causes this\r\nwater to freeze and thus rend the rock along its planes of jointing.\r\nBroad and thin plates of ice, loosened by melting at the walls, could\r\nbe extracted from the crevices of the rock as mute witnesses to the\r\npowerful stresses developed by this most vigorous of weathering\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 394.—Subordinate small cirques in the amphitheater on the west\r\nface of the Wannehorn above the Great Aletsch Glacier of Switzerland.]\r\n\r\nIn short, the rock wall above the glacier, which in its initial stage\r\nwas the upper wall of the niche hollowed beneath the snowdrift, is\r\nfirst steepened and later continually both recessed and deepened by\r\nan intensive frost rending which is in operation at the base of the\r\nmarginal crevasse. The same process does not go on as rapidly above the\r\nsurface of the névé for the reason that _the necessary wetting of the\r\nrock surface does not there so generally result from the daily summer\r\nthaw_. At the bottom of the marginal crevasse alone is this condition\r\nfully realized. Intensive frost action _where the rock is wet with thaw\r\nwater daily_ is thus a fundamental cause, both of the hollowing of\r\nthe early drift site to form the niche, and of the later enlargement\r\nof this niche into an amphitheater or cirque when the drift has been\r\ntransformed into the névé of a glacier. Inasmuch as the crevasse forms\r\nwhere the snow and ice pull away from the rock toward the middle of the\r\ndepression, the cirque wall in its early stage has the outline of a\r\nsemicircle. In the Bighorn Mountains of Wyoming, all stages, from the\r\nunmodified valley heads to the full-formed cirque, may be seen near\r\none another (Fig. 393). It will be noted that wherever a glacier has\r\nformed, as indicated by the cirque, there is a series of lakes which\r\nhave developed in the valley below (see p. 412).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 395.—“Biscuit cutting” effect of glacial sculpture\r\nin the Uinta Mountains of Wyoming (after Atwood).]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 396.—Two intersecting inverted cones representing glacial cirques\r\nof different sizes, to show that their intersection is the arc of a\r\nhyperbola, the curve to which the col approximates.]\r\n\r\n=Life history of the cirque.=—In its earliest stage the cirque is more\r\nor less uniformly supplied with snow from all sides, and so it enlarges\r\nby recession in a manner to retain its early semicircular outline. In\r\na later stage a larger proportion of the snow reaches the cirque at\r\nits sides so that its further enlargement causes it to broaden and to\r\nflatten somewhat that part of its outline which represents the head of\r\nthe valley (Fig. 389, p. 364). As the territory of the upland is still\r\nfurther invested by the cirques, their nourishment becomes still more\r\nirregular, and the circular outline gives place to a scalloped border,\r\nas the amphitheater becomes differentiated into subordinate smaller\r\ncirques, each of which corresponds to a scallop of the outline (Fig.\r\n398 and Fig. 394).\r\n\r\n=Grooved and fretted uplands.=—The partial investment by cirques of a\r\nmountain upland yields a type of topography quite unlike that produced\r\nby any other geological process. The irregularly connected remnants\r\nof the inherited upland resemble nothing so much as a layer of dough\r\nfrom which biscuits have been cut (Fig. 395). The surface as a whole,\r\nfurrowed as it is below the cirques,\r\nmay be described as a _grooved upland_ (plate 19 A). A further\r\ncontinuation of the process removes all traces of the earlier upland,\r\nfor the cirques intersect from opposite sides and thus yield palisades\r\nof sharp rock pinnacles which rise on precipitous walls from a terraced\r\nfloor. This ultimate product of cirque sculpture by glaciers is called\r\na _fretted upland_ (plate 18 A and 19 B).\r\n\r\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n│   PLATE 18.                                                         │\r\n│                                                                     │\r\n│ [Illustration: _A._ Fretted upland of the Alps seen from the summit │\r\n│ of Mount Blanc.]                                                    │\r\n│                                                                     │\r\n│ [Illustration: _B._ Model of the Malaspina Glacier and the fretted  │\r\n│ upland above it (after model by L.

Cirques which have approached each other from opposite sides\r\nof the ridge until they have become tangent at one point may, however,\r\nstill receive nourishment at the sides and so continue to cut down the\r\nintervening rock wall to form a pass or _col_. The theoretical curve\r\nwhich results from this intersection is that known as the hyperbola, of\r\nwhich an illustration is afforded by Fig. 396. An approximation to this\r\nform is clearly furnished by most of the mountain passes in glaciated\r\nmountain districts, and a particularly good illustration is furnished\r\nfrom the vicinity of Glacier on the line of the Canadian Pacific\r\nRailway (Fig. 397).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 398.—Diagrams to illustrate the progressive investment of an\r\nupland by cirques with the formation of comb ridges, cols, and horns.\r\nI, early stage, youth; II, intermediate stage; III, late stage,\r\nmaturity.]\r\n\r\nUpon either side of the col the land mass is left in high relief,\r\nrising from a more or less triangular base (Fig. 398, III) into a sharp\r\nhorn or tooth. An illustration of such a _horn_ is furnished by the\r\nMatterhorn in the Swiss Alps, or by Mount Sir Donald in the Selkirks,\r\nthough less noteworthy examples may be found in every maturely\r\nglaciated mountain district.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The features shaped beneath the glacier.=—Those features which are\r\ncarved above the glacier—the comb ridge, the col, and the horn—are\r\nall shaped as a result of intensive weathering upon the cirque wall.\r\nThe shaping at lower levels is accomplished by processes in operation\r\nbelow the glacier surface, where weathering is excluded and where\r\nplucking and abrasion work together to tear away and grind off the rock\r\nsurface. By their joint action the valley is both deepened and widened,\r\ndirectly to the height of the glacier surface, and indirectly through\r\nundermining as far up as rock extends. Thus the valley is transformed\r\ninto one of broad and flat bed and precipitous side walls—the U-shaped\r\nsection illustrated by valleys of the Swiss Alps and in fact in all\r\ndistricts which have been strongly glaciated by mountain glaciers (Fig.\r\n399).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 399.—The U-shaped Kern valley in the Sierra Nevadas of California\r\n(after W. B. Scott).]\r\n\r\nAs high up in the valley as it has been occupied by the glacier,\r\nthe bed is rounded, smoothed, and polished, and marked by the\r\ncharacteristic glacial scorings or striæ which point down the valley.\r\nAbove the level of the glacier’s upper surface, on the other hand,\r\nerosion is accomplished through undermining or sapping, a process which\r\nalways leaves precipitous slopes of ragged surface made up of the joint\r\nplanes on which the fallen blocks have separated from the cliff. Thus\r\nthere is found a sharp line which separates the smoothly rounded rock\r\nsurface below from the jagged and precipitous one above (Fig. 400).\r\nInasmuch as this boundary usually separates the scalable from the\r\ninaccessible slopes above, snow is apt to lodge at this level and make\r\nit strikingly apparent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 400.—Glaciated valley wall in the Sierra Nevadas of California,\r\nshowing the sharp line which separates the abraded from the undermined\r\nrock surface (after a photograph by Fairbanks).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 401.—View of the Vale of Chamonix from the séracs of the Glacier\r\ndes Bossons. The alb of the opposite side is well brought out.]\r\n\r\nIf uplift of the land occurs while glaciers occupy the valleys of\r\nmountains, an increased capacity for deepening the valley is imparted\r\nto these ice streams, and we find, as a result, a deep central valley\r\nof U cross section excavated within a relatively broad trough visible\r\nabove the shoulder on either side of the later furrow. Save only for\r\nits characteristic curves, such a valley bears close resemblance to\r\na mature stream valley which has been rejuvenated (see p. 173). The\r\nremnants of the earlier glacier-carved valley are, as already stated,\r\ngently curving high terraces so common in Switzerland, where they\r\nare known as _albs_ or high mountain meadows. These albs may be seen\r\nto special advantage on the sides of the Chamonix valley (Fig. 401),\r\nthe Lauterbrunnen valley, or in fact almost any of the larger Alpine\r\nvalleys.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The cascade stairway in glacier-carved valleys.=—If now, instead of\r\ngiving our attention to the cross section, we follow the course of the\r\nvalley that has been occupied by a glacier, we find that it descends\r\nby a series of steps or terraces having many backwardly directed\r\ntreads (plate 19), whereas a normal and well-established river valley\r\nhas only forward grades. Because of these backward grades the stream\r\nwaters are impounded, and so lakes are found strung along the valley\r\nin chains as the larger beads are found in a rosary, and these are the\r\ncharacteristic _rock basin lakes_ sometimes referred to as “Paternoster\r\nLakes” (see p. 412 and Fig. 402).\r\n\r\n┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n│   PLATE 20.                                                       │\r\n│                                                                   │\r\n│ [Illustration: Map of the surface modeled by mountain glaciers in │\r\n│ the Sierra Nevadas of California (after I.

In a walk from the Grimsel to Meiringen\r\nmany such bars are passed. Carrying in suspension the sharp rock sand\r\nfrom the glacier deposits along its bed, the stream which succeeds\r\nto the glacier as it vacates its valley saws its way through these\r\nobstructions with a rapidity that is amazing, thus producing narrow\r\ndefiles, of which the Gorge of the Aar near Meiringen and that of the\r\nGorner near Zermatt are such well-known examples (Fig. 403).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 402.—Map of an area near the continental divide in Colorado,\r\nshowing an unglaciated surface to the west of the divide, where the\r\nwesterly winds have cleared the ground of snow, and the glacier-carved\r\ncountry to the eastward.

S.).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 403.—Gorge of the Albula River near Berkum in the Engadine, cut\r\nthrough a rock bar by the river which has succeeded to the earlier\r\nglacier.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 404.—Idealistic sketch showing both glaciated and nonglaciated\r\nside valleys tributary to a glaciated main valley (after Davis).]\r\n\r\nIt is characteristic of rivers that the tributaries cut their valleys\r\nmore rapidly than does the main stream within the neighboring section,\r\nthough they cannot cut lower than their outlets—the side streams enter\r\n_accordantly_. This is easily explained because the grades of the\r\ntributary streams are the steeper, and, as we well know, the corrosion\r\nof a valley is augmented at a most amazing rate for each increase of\r\nits grade. No such law controls the processes of plucking and abrasion\r\nby which the glacier lowers its floor, for these processes appear to\r\ndepend for their efficiency upon the depth of the ice, and the supply\r\nof cutting tools, quite as much as upon the grade of the bed. To apply\r\na homely illustration, the hollowing of flagstones upon our walks is\r\ndependent more upon the number of persons that pass over them, and upon\r\ntheir size and the number of protruding nails in their boot heels, than\r\nupon the grades upon which they are placed. At all events we find that\r\nthe main glacier valleys are cut deeper than the side valleys, so that\r\nthe latter become _hanging valleys_—they enter the main valley, not\r\nupon its bed, but some distance above it (Fig. 404).\r\n\r\nThe U-shaped hanging valleys, like the main valley, are much too large\r\nfor the streams which now fill them, and these diminutive side streams\r\nplunge over the steep wall of the main valley in ribbon-like falls so\r\nthin that the wind turns them aside and disperses the water in the\r\nspray of a “bridal veil.” Such falls are found by the hundred in every\r\nglaciated mountain district, imparting to it one of the greatest of its\r\nscenic charms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 405.—Character profiles in landscapes sculptured\r\nby mountain glaciers.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 406.—Flat dome shaped under the margin of\r\na Norwegian ice cap with projecting rock knobs and moraines in\r\nforeground.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The character profiles which result from sculpture by mountain\r\nglaciers.=—The lines which are repeated in landscapes carved by\r\nmountain glaciers are easy to recognize (Fig. 405). The highest\r\nhorizon lines are the outlines of horns which are separated by cols.\r\nMinaret-like palisades, or “files of _gendarmes_”, often run for long\r\ndistances as the characteristic comb ridges. Lower down and lacking\r\nthe lighter background of the sky, we make out with less distinctness\r\nthe U-valley, either with or without the albs to show that the\r\nsculpturing process has been interrupted by uplift.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 407.—Two views illustrating successive stages in\r\nthe shaping of tinds or “beehive” mountains.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The sculpture accomplished by ice caps.=—In the case of ice caps,\r\nthe only rock exposed is found in the neighborhood of the margin—the\r\nprojecting islands known as nunataks. It is essential for the existence\r\nof the ice cap that the rock base should have relatively slight\r\nirregularities compared to the dimensions of the cap itself. Except\r\nin very high latitudes this base must be somewhat elevated, for like\r\nmountain glaciers ice caps are nourished by the surface air currents,\r\nand their snows are deposited above the snow line.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Norwegian tind or beehive mountain.=—Within temperate or tropical\r\nclimes the snow line lies so high that only the loftier mountains\r\nare able to support glaciers. It follows that those which are formed\r\nflow upon relatively high grades with correspondingly high rate of\r\nmovement and increased cutting power. Within high latitudes the snow\r\nis found nearer the sea level, and glaciers are for the most part\r\ncorrespondingly sluggish in their movements as well as less active\r\ndenuding agents.\r\n\r\nTo this condition characteristic of high latitude glaciers, there is\r\nadded in Norway another in the peculiar shape of the basement beneath\r\nthe recent and the still existing glaciers. The plateau of Norway is\r\nintersected by a network of deep and steep walled fjords, and the\r\nglaciers have developed as small ice caps perched upon veritable\r\npedestals of rock, over the margins of which their outlet tongues of\r\nice descend on steep slopes into the fjord. The tops of the pedestals\r\nthus come to be shaped by the plucking and abrading processes into\r\nflat domes (Fig. 406), while the knobs of rock, which as nunataks\r\nreach above the surface of the ice, divide the outflowing ice tongues\r\nat the margin of the pedestal. These tongues being much more active\r\ndenuding agents, because of their steep gradients, continually lower\r\ntheir beds, thus transforming the earlier knobs of rock into high and\r\nsteep mountains of more or less circular base. Such “beehive” mountains\r\nupon the margins of the fjords are the characteristic Norwegian _tinds_\r\n(Fig. 407).\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING REFERENCES FOR CHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n I. C. RUSSELL.

We are thus living\r\nin a receding hemicycle of glaciation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 408.—Schematic diagram to show the relationships\r\nof glacier types formed in succession during a receding hemicycle of\r\nglaciation.]\r\n\r\nMany mountain districts which now support small glaciers only, or\r\nnone at all, were once nearly or quite submerged beneath snow and\r\nice. If once covered by an ice carapace or cap, our present interest\r\nin them begins at that stage of the receding hemicycle _when the rock\r\nsurface has made its reappearance above the surface of the snow-ice\r\nmass_. At this stage intensive frostwork, the characteristic high\r\nlevel weathering, begins, and cirques develop above the scars of those\r\nearlier amphitheaters formed in the advancing hemicycle.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The piedmont glacier.=—In this early stage of transition from the\r\nice cap to the mountain glacier, the ice flows outward to the mountain\r\nfront in ill-defined streams divided by the projecting ridges, and\r\nupon reaching the mountain front these streams deploy upon it so as\r\nto coalesce in a great stagnant ice apron whose upper surface slopes\r\ngently forward at an angle of a few degrees at the most (Fig. 408,\r\nstage I). This is the _piedmont glacier_, a type found to-day in the\r\nhigh latitudes of Alaska and in the southern Andes (Fig. 409 and pl. 18\r\nB).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 409.—Map of the Malaspina glacier of Alaska, the\r\nbest known of existing piedmont glaciers (after Russell).]\r\n\r\nDuring this stage the cirques may be but poorly defined, and ice flows\r\nin both directions from rock divides so that the streams transect the\r\nrange, and later, after the glaciers have disappeared, may expose a\r\npass smoothed and polished upon its floor and with striæ directed in\r\nopposite directions from the highest point. The pass of the Grimsel\r\nin Switzerland furnishes an excellent illustration of such earlier\r\ntransection of the range.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 410.—Map of the Baltoro glacier of the Himalayas, a typical\r\nglacier of the dendritic type.]\r\n\r\n=The expanded-foot glacier.=—As air temperatures continue to become\r\nmilder, the glacier streams within the mountains are less deep and\r\nhence more clearly defined, and instead of coalescing upon the mountain\r\nforeland, they now issue from the mountains to form individual aprons\r\nand are described as _expanded-foot glaciers_ (Fig. 408, stage II, and\r\nFig. 292, p. 264).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 411.—The Triest glacier, a hanging glacieret separated from the\r\nGreat Aletsch glacier to which it was lately a tributary.]\r\n\r\n=The dendritic glacier.=—Still later in the hemicycle nourishment of\r\nthe glaciers is diminished as depletion from melting increases, so that\r\nthe glacier streams no longer reach to the mountain front. Branches\r\ncontinue to enter the main valley from the several side valleys like\r\nthe short branches of a tall tree, and because of this arrangement such\r\na glacier may be described as a _dendritic glacier_ (Fig. 408, stage\r\nIII, and Fig. 410).\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the depletion from melting increases at a rapid rate in\r\ndescending to lower levels, the tributary glacier valleys “hanging”\r\nabove the main valley in the lower stretches become separated, and may\r\ncontinue to exist as series of hanging glacierets upon either side\r\nof the main valley below the glacier front (Fig. 408, stage III, and\r\nFig. 411). It must be clear from this that any attempt to name each\r\nseparated ice stream without regard to its relationship must lead to\r\nendless confusion, for glacier size is in such sensitive adjustment\r\nto air temperature that a fall or rise of a few degrees only in the\r\naverage annual temperature of the district may prove sufficient to fuse\r\nmany glaciers into one or separate one ice mass into many smaller ones.\r\n\r\nWhen in high latitudes a dendritic glacier descends in fjords to\r\nbelow the level of the sea, it is attacked by the water in the same\r\nmanner as are the outlets of Greenland glaciers, and is then known as\r\na “tidewater glacier”, which may thus be a subtype or variety of the\r\ndendritic glacier (Fig. 412).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 412.—The Harriman fjord glacier of Alaska, a tidewater variety of\r\ndendritic glacier (after a map by Gannett).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The radiating (Alpine) glacier.=—In the progressive wastings of\r\ndendritic glaciers, there comes a time when their dendritic outlines\r\ngive place to radiating ones. Attention has already been called to the\r\ndivision of the cirque into subordinate basins separated by small rock\r\narêtes and yielding a markedly scalloped border (Fig. 394, p. 371).\r\nWhen the ice front retires from the main valley into one of these\r\nmature cirques, the now wasted ice stream is broken up into subordinate\r\nglacierets, each of which occupies one of the basins within the larger\r\ncirque, and these ice streams flow together to produce a glacier whose\r\ncomponent elements radiate like the sticks within a lady’s fan (Fig.\r\n408, stage IV, and Fig. 413).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 413.—Map of the Rotmoos glacier, a radiating glacier of\r\nSwitzerland (after Sonklar).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The horseshoe glacier.=—As the glacier draws near to its final\r\nextinction, it is crowded hard against the wall of the amphitheater in\r\nwhich it has so long been nourished. Up to this stage it has offered\r\na swelling front outwardly convex as a direct consequence of the laws\r\ncontrolling its flow. No longer amply nourished, for the first time\r\nits front is hollowed, and it awaits its final dissolution curled up\r\nagainst the cirque wall (Fig. 408, stage V, and Fig. 414). Practically\r\nall the glaciers of the United States and southern Canada are of this\r\ntype.\r\n\r\nThe above classification is one depending directly upon glacier\r\nnourishment, and hence also upon size, and upon the stage of the\r\nglacial hemicycle. In order to determine the type of any glacier it is\r\nnecessary to know the outlines of the mountain valley—its divide—and\r\nthose of the glacier or glaciers within it. It is likely that the\r\ntypes of the advancing hemicycle of glaciation would be much the same,\r\nsave only for the _new-born_ or _nivation glacier_, which would be as\r\ndifferent as possible from the horseshoe type, to which in size it\r\ncorresponds. Upon the continent of Antarctica, where the absence of any\r\ngeneral melting of the ice, even in the summer season and near the sea\r\nlevel, introduces special conditions, some additional glacier types are\r\nfound, which, however, it is not necessary that we consider here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 414.—Outline map of the Asulkan glacier in the\r\nSelkirks, a typical horseshoe glacier.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The inherited-basin glacier.=—It may be, however, that glaciers have\r\ndeveloped, not upon mountains shaped in a cycle of river erosion, nor\r\nyet in succession to an ice cap, as in the normal cases which we have\r\nconsidered. On the contrary, glaciers may develop where basins of\r\none sort or another have been inherited from the preceding period.\r\nIn such cases inherited depressions may become more important than\r\nthe auto-sculpture of the glacier. Glaciers which develop under such\r\nconditions may be described as _inherited-basin glaciers_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 415.—Outline map of the Illecillewaet glacier, an\r\ninherited-basin glacier in the Selkirks.]\r\n\r\nA partly closed basin between ridges may supply a collecting ground for\r\nsnows carried from neighboring slopes by the wind, and so may yield a\r\nbroad névé, approaching in size a small ice cap, yet without developing\r\ndefinite ice streams except upon its border. Such a glacier is the\r\nIllecillewaet glacier of the Selkirks (Fig. 415).\r\n\r\nAgain in low latitudes the high and pointed volcanic peaks may push\r\nup beyond the snow line into the upper atmosphere, and so become\r\nsnow-capped. Definite cirques do not develop well under these\r\ncircumstances, and the loose materials of which such peaks are always\r\ncomposed are attacked in somewhat irregular fashion from the different\r\nsides. This is the case of Mount Rainier and similar peaks of the\r\nCascade range of North America.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Summary of types of mountain glacier.=—In tabular form the various\r\ntypes of mountain glacier may be arranged as follows:—\r\n\r\nMOUNTAIN GLACIERS\r\n\r\n _Piedmont glacier._ Mountain valleys entirely occupied and largely\r\n submerged, with overflow upon the foreland to form a common ice apron\r\n through coalescence of neighboring streams.\r\n\r\n _Expanded-foot glacier._ Valley entirely occupied and an overflow upon\r\n the foreland sufficient to produce individual ice apron.\r\n\r\n _Dendritic glacier._ Valley not completely occupied but with tributary\r\n ice streams ranged along the sides of the main stream, and with\r\n hanging glacierets separated near the glacier foot.\r\n\r\n _Radiating glacier._ Glacier largely included in a cirque with\r\n subordinate glacierets converging below like the sticks in a lady’s\r\n fan.\r\n\r\n _Horseshoe glacier._ Small glacier remnants hugging the cirque wall\r\n and having an incurving front.\r\n\r\n _Inherited-basin glacier._ Of form dependent on a basin inherited and\r\n not shaped by the glacier itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING REFERENCE FOR CHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n WILLIAM H. HOBBS. The Cycle of Mountain Glaciation, Geogr.

Their first\r\nobservation was that the line of stakes, which had run straight across\r\nthe glacier, was distorted into a curve which was convex downstream\r\n(Fig. 416, A´), thus showing that the surface layers have more rapid\r\nmotion in proportion as they are distant from the side margins.\r\nSummarizing these and later studies, it may be stated that the glacier\r\nincreases its rate of motion from its side margin towards its center\r\nline, from its bed upwards towards its surface, and below the névé the\r\nvelocity is greatest where the fall is greatest and also wherever the\r\ncross section diminishes. In all these particulars, then, the ice of\r\nthe glacier behaves like a stream of water. The average rate of flow of\r\nAlpine glaciers varies from a few inches to a few feet per day, and is\r\ngreater during the warm summer season. The Muir glacier of Alaska has\r\nbeen shown to move at the rate of about seven feet per day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 416.—Diagram to illustrate the migrations of lines of stakes\r\ncrossing a glacier, due to its surface movement, _A_, original position\r\nof lines; _A´_, later positions; _a_ and _a´_, original and distorted\r\nforms of a square section of the glacier surface near its margin; _r_,\r\n_r´_, diagonal crevasses.]\r\n\r\nIn traveling from the névé downward to the glacier foot, the snow not\r\nonly changes into ice, but it undergoes a granulating process with\r\ncontinued increase in the size of the nodules until at the foot of\r\nthe glacier these may be picked out of the partially melted ice as\r\narticulating balls the size of the fist or larger. Glacier ice has\r\ntherefore a structure quite different from that of lake ice, since the\r\nlatter is developed in parallel needles perpendicular to the freezing\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Crevasses and séracs.=—Prominent surface indications of glacier\r\nmovement are found in the open cracks or _crevasses_, which are the\r\nmarks of its yielding to tensional stresses. Crevasses are apt to run\r\neither directly across the glacier, wherever there is a steep descent\r\nupon its bed, or diagonally, running in from the margin and directed\r\nup-glacier (_r_, _r_, _r_, of Fig. 416), though they occasionally run\r\nlongitudinally with the glacier when there is a rock terrace at the\r\nside of the valley beneath the ice. The diagonal crevasses at the\r\nglacier margin are due to the more sluggish movement where the ice is\r\nheld back by friction upon the walls of the valley, as will be clear\r\nfrom Fig. 416. The square _a_ has by this movement been distorted into\r\nthe lozenge _a´_, so that the line _xy_ has been extended into _x´y´_,\r\nwith the obvious tendency to open cracks in the direction _ss_.\r\n\r\nEvery glacier surface below its névé is marked by steps or terraces,\r\nwhich are well understood to overlie corresponding steps of the cascade\r\nstairway to be seen in all vacated glacier valleys (plate 19). The\r\nsteep risers of these steps are usually marked by parallel crevasses\r\nwhich cross the glacier. Under the rays of the sun, which strike them\r\nmore from one side than from the other, the slices into which the ice\r\nis divided are transformed into sharpened blades and needles which are\r\nknown as _séracs_ (Fig. 401, p. 376, and Fig. 417).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 417.—Transverse crevasses at the fall below a glacier step\r\ntransformed by unsymmetrical melting into séracs.]\r\n\r\nThe numerous crevasses tell us that the ice is many times wrenched\r\napart during its journey down the glacier. This has been illustrated by\r\nsomewhat grewsome incidents connected with accidents to Alpinists, but\r\nas they illustrate in some measure both the mode and the rate of motion\r\nof Swiss glaciers, they are worthy of our consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bodies given up by the Glacier _des Bossons_.=—In the year 1820,\r\nduring one of the earlier ascents of Mont Blanc, three guides were\r\nburied beneath an avalanche near the _Rochers Rouges_ in the névé\r\nof the Glacier des Bossons (Fig. 418). In 1858 Dr. Forbes, who had\r\nmeasured the rate of flow of a number of Alpine glaciers, predicted\r\nthat the bodies of the victims of this accident would be given up by\r\nthe glacier after being entombed from thirty-five to forty years. In\r\nthe year 1861, or forty-one years after the disaster, the heads of\r\nthe three guides, separated from their bodies, with some hands and\r\nfragments of clothing, appeared at the foot of the Glacier des Bossons,\r\nand in such a state of preservation that they were easily recognized\r\nby a guide who had known them in life. Inasmuch as these fragments of\r\nthe bodies had required forty-one years to travel in the ice the three\r\nthousand meters which separate the place of the accident from the foot\r\nof the glacier, the rate of movement was twenty centimeters, or eight\r\ninches, per day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 418.—View of the _Glacier des Bossons_ upon the slopes of Mont\r\nBlanc showing the position of accidents to Alpinists and the place of\r\nreappearance of their bodies.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 419.—Lines of flow upon the surface of the\r\nHintereisferner glacier in the Alps (after Hess).]\r\n\r\nVarious separated parts of the body of Captain Arkwright, who had been\r\nlost in 1866 upon the névé of the same glacier, reappeared at its foot\r\nafter entombment in the ice for a period of thirty-one years. To-day\r\nthe time of reappearance of portions of the bodies of persons lost\r\nupon Mont Blanc is rather accurately predicted, so that friends repair\r\nto Chamonix to await the giving up of its victims by the Glacier des\r\nBossons.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 420.—Lateral and medial moraines of the _Mer de glace_ and its\r\ntributary ice streams.]\r\n\r\n=The moraines.=—The horns and comb ridges which rise above the glacier\r\nsurface are continually subject to frost weathering, and from time to\r\ntime drop their separated fragments upon the glacier. Falling as these\r\ndo from considerable heights, they reach the ice under a high velocity,\r\nand rebounding, sometimes travel well out upon its surface before\r\ncoming to a temporary rest. Upon a fresh snow surface of the névé\r\ntheir tracks may sometimes be followed with the eye for considerable\r\ndistances, and their fall is a constant menace to Alpine climbers.\r\nBelow the névé the larger number of such fragments remain near the\r\ncliff, and the lines of flow of the ice within the glacier surface are\r\nsuch that blocks which reach points farther out upon the glacier are\r\nlater gathered in beneath the cliff at the side (Fig. 419). The ridge\r\nof angular rock débris which thus forms at the side of the glacier is\r\ncalled a _lateral moraine_ (see Fig. 411, p. 385, and Fig. 420).\r\n\r\nAt the junction of two glacier streams, the lateral moraines are\r\njoined, and there move out upon the ice surface of the resultant\r\nglacier as a _medial moraine_. Thus from the number of medial moraines\r\nupon a glacier surface it is possible to say that the important\r\ntributary glaciers number one more (Fig. 420).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 421.—Ideal cross-section of a mountain glacier to\r\nshow the position of moraines and other peculiarities characteristic of\r\nthe surface of the bed.]\r\n\r\nThe plucking and abrading processes in operation beneath the glacier,\r\nquarry the rock upon its bed, and after shaping and smoothing the\r\nseparated rock fragments, these are incorporated within the lower\r\nlayers of the ice as _englacial_ rock débris. In spaces favorable for\r\nits accumulation, a portion of this material, together with much finer\r\ndébris and rock flour, is left behind as a ground moraine upon the bed\r\nof the glacier (see Fig. 421).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 422.—Fragments of rock of different sizes, to\r\nbring out their different effects upon the melting of the glacier\r\nsurface.]\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the glacier the relatively angular rock débris, which\r\nhas been carried upon the surface, and the soled and polished englacial\r\nmaterial from near the bottom, are alike deposited in a common marginal\r\nridge known as the _terminal_ or _end moraine_ (plate 21 B).\r\n\r\n\r\n┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n│   PLATE 21.                                                          │\r\n│                                                                      │\r\n│ [Illustration: _A._ View of the Harvard Glacier, Alaska, showing the │\r\n│ characteristic terraces (after U.

Such fragments,\r\nhowever, promote or retard the melting process in inverse proportion to\r\ntheir size up to a certain limit, and above that size their action is\r\nalways to protect the glacier from the sun. This nice adjustment to the\r\nsize of the rock fragments will be clear from examination of Fig. 422,\r\nfor rock is a poor conductor of heat, and in even the longest summer\r\nday a thin outer layer only is appreciably warmed. Large rock blocks,\r\ngrouped in the medial and lateral moraines, hold back the process of\r\nlowering the glacier surface during the summer, so that late in the\r\nseason these moraines stand fifty feet or more above the glacier as\r\narmored ice ridges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 423.—Small glacier table upon the surface of the Great Aletsch\r\nglacier in 1908.]\r\n\r\nIsolated and large rock slabs, as the season advances, may come to form\r\nthe capping of an ice pedestal which they overhang and are known as\r\n_glacier tables_ (Fig. 423). Such tables the sun attacks more upon one\r\nside than upon the other, so that the slab inclines more and more to\r\nthe south and may eventually slip down until its edges rest against the\r\nglacier surface. Rounded bowlders, which less frequently become perched\r\nupon ice pedestals, may, from a similar process, slide down upon the\r\nsouthern side and leave a pyramid of ice furrowed upon this side and\r\nknown as an _ice pyramid_.\r\n\r\nFine dirt when scattered over the glacier surface is, on the other\r\nhand, most effective in lowering its level by melting. Use was made\r\nof this knowledge to lower the great drifts of snow which had to be\r\nremoved each season during the construction of the new Bergen railway\r\nof southern Norway. Each dirt particle, being warmed throughout by\r\nthe sun’s rays, melts its way rapidly into the glacier surface until\r\nthe _dust well_ which it has formed is so deep that the slanting\r\nrays of the sun no longer reach it. When the dirt particles are near\r\ntogether, the thin walls which separate the dust wells are attacked\r\nfrom the sides in the warm air of summer days, thus producing from a\r\npatch of dirt upon the glacier surface a _bath tub_ (Fig. 424 _d_). At\r\nnight the water which fills these basins is frozen to form a lining\r\nof ice needles projecting inward from the wall, and this, repeated in\r\nsucceeding nights, may entirely close the basin with water ice and\r\nproduce the familiar _glacier star_ (Fig. 424 _c_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 424.—Effects of differential melting and subsequent refreezing\r\nupon the glacier surface. _a_, dust wells; _b_, glacier _tub_ produced\r\nby melting about a group of scattered dust particles; _c_, glacier star\r\nproduced when the inclosed water of the glacier well has frozen in\r\nsuccessive nights; _d_, “bath tub.”]\r\n\r\nIf the dirt upon the glacier surface, instead of being scattered, is\r\nso disposed as to make a patch completely covering the ice to the\r\nthickness of an inch or more, the effect is altogether different.\r\nProtecting as it now does the ice below, a local ice hillock rises upon\r\nits site as the surrounding surface is lowered, and as this grows in\r\nheight its declivities increase and a portion of the dirt slides down\r\nthe side. The final product of this shaping is an almost perfectly\r\nconical ice hill encased in dirt and known as a _débris_, _sand_, or\r\n_dirt cone_ (Fig. 425). The novice in glacier study is apt to assume\r\nthat these black cones contain only dirt, but is rudely awakened to the\r\nreality when he attempts to kick them to pieces. Both glacier tubs and\r\ndébris cones may assume large dimensions; as, for example, in Alaska,\r\nwhere they may be properly described as lakes and hills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 425.—Dirt cone and one with its casing in part\r\nremoved. Victoria glacier (after Sherzer).]\r\n\r\nA patch of hard and dense snow which is less easily melted than that\r\nupon which it rests may lead to the formation of snow cones upon\r\nthe glacier surface similar in size and shape to the better known\r\ndébris cones. Such cones of snow have, with doubtful propriety, been\r\ndesignated “penitents”, for it is pretty clear that the interesting\r\nbowed snow figures, which really resemble penitents and which were\r\nfirst described from the southern Andes under the name of _nieves\r\npenitentes_, are of somewhat different character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 426.—Schematic diagram to show the manner of formation of glacier\r\ncornices.]\r\n\r\nOne further ice feature shaped by differential melting around rock\r\nparticles remains to be mentioned. Wherever the seasonal snowfalls\r\nof the névé are exposed in crevasses, they are generally found to be\r\nseparated by layers of dirt, and lines of pebbles similarly separate\r\nthose ice layers which are revealed at the foot of the glacier. In\r\neither case, if the sun’s rays can reach these layers in an opened\r\ncrevasse, the half-buried rock fragments are warmed by the sun upon\r\ntheir exposed surfaces and slowly melt their way down the ice surface,\r\nthus removing from it a thin layer of snow or ice and causing that part\r\nabove the pebble layer to project like a cornice. This process will go\r\non until the overhanging cornice protects the pebbles from any further\r\nwarming by the sun, but each lower pebble layer that is reached by the\r\nsun will produce an additional cornice, so that the original surface\r\nmay at the bottom have been retired by the process a number of inches.\r\nThese features are described as _glacier cornices_ (Fig. 426).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 427.—Superglacial stream upon the Great Aletsch\r\nglacier.]\r\n\r\n=Glacier drainage.=—Already in the early morning of every warm summer\r\nday, active melting has begun upon the surface of the Swiss glaciers.\r\nRills of icy water soon make their way along depressions upon the\r\nsurface, and are joined to one another so that they sometimes form\r\nbrooks of considerable size (Fig. 427). Such streams continue their\r\nserpentine courses until these are intersected by a crevasse down which\r\nthe waters plunge in a whirling vortex which soon develops a vertical\r\nshaft of circular section within the ice. Such shafts with their\r\ndescending columns of whirling water are the well-known _moulins_, or\r\n“_mills_”, which may be detected from a distance by their gurgling\r\nsounds. The first plunge of the water may not reach to the bottom of\r\nthe glacier, in which case the stream finds a passageway below the\r\nsurface but above the floor until another crevasse is encountered and\r\na new plunge made, here perhaps to the bottom. Once upon the valley\r\nfloor the stream is joined by others, and pursues its course within an\r\nice tunnel of its own making (Fig. 421, p. 394) until it issues at the\r\nglacier front.\r\n\r\nThe coarser of the rock débris which was gathered up by the stream\r\nupon the glacier surface is deposited within the tunnel in imperfect\r\nassortment (gravel and sand), while all finer material and that lifted\r\nfrom the floor (rock flour) is retained in suspension and gives to the\r\nescaping stream its opaque white appearance. This _glacier milk_ may\r\ngenerally be traced far down the valleys or out upon the foreland,\r\nand is often the traveler’s first indication that a range which he is\r\napproaching supports glaciers.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 428.—Ideal form of the surface left on the site of the apron of\r\na piedmont glacier. _M_, moraine; _T_, outwash; _C_, basin usually\r\noccupied by a lake; _D_, drumlins (after Penck).]\r\n\r\n=Deposits within the vacated valley.=—For every excavation of the\r\nhigher portions of the upland through glacial sculpture, there is a\r\ncorresponding deposit of the excavated materials in lower levels. So\r\nfar as these materials are deposited directly by the ice, they form\r\nthe lateral, medial, ground, and terminal moraines already described.\r\nA considerable proportion of them are, however, deposited by the\r\nwater outside the terminal moraine; but as with the shrinking glacier\r\nthe ice front retires in halting movements over the area earlier\r\nice-covered, the terminal moraines are ranged along the vacated valley\r\nas _recessional moraines_, each with a _valley train_ of outwash below.\r\nAbout the apron of the piedmont glacier, such deposits are particularly\r\nheavy (Fig. 428). During the “ice age” the Swiss glaciers extended down\r\nthe valleys below the existing ice remnants and spread upon the Swiss\r\nforeland as great piedmont glaciers such as may now be seen in Alaska.\r\nTo-day we find there moraines and glacial outwash, a lake in the middle\r\nof the apron site, and sometimes a group of radiating drumlins like\r\nthose found within the ice lobes of the continental glacier in southern\r\nWisconsin (Fig. 429, and Fig. 344, p. 317).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 429.—Moraines and drumlins about Lake Constance upon the site of\r\nthe earlier piedmont glacier of the Upper Rhine. The white area outside\r\nthe outermost moraine is buried in glacial outwash (after Penck and\r\nBrückner).]\r\n\r\nBehind the recessional moraines within the glaciated valley are found\r\nthe valley moraine lakes (Fig. 448, p. 413), in association with the\r\nrock basin lakes due to glacial sculpture (Fig. 447, p. 412). After\r\nthe glacier has vacated its valley, the precipitous side walls become\r\nthe prey of frostwork and are the scenes of disastrous avalanches or\r\nlandslides. Within the cirques, drifts of snow are nourished long after\r\nthe ice has disappeared, and as a consequence the amphitheater walls\r\nsuccumb to the process of solifluxion (p. 153).\r\n\r\nDiversions and reversals of drainage, which are so characteristic of\r\nthe work of continental glaciers, are hardly less common to glaciated\r\nmountain districts. Many of our most beautiful waterfalls have resulted\r\nfrom either the temporary or permanent obstruction of earlier valleys\r\nabove the falls. The famous Yosemite Falls offers an interesting\r\nillustration of the shifting of an earlier waterfall, itself no doubt\r\ndue to ice blocking in a still earlier glaciation (plate 22 B).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Marks of the earlier occupation of mountains by glaciers.=—It is\r\nwell that we should now bring together within a small compass those\r\nevidences by which the existence of earlier mountain glaciers may be\r\nproven in any district. These marks are so deeply stamped upon the\r\nlandscape that no one need err in their interpretation.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKS OF MOUNTAIN GLACIERS\r\n\r\n _High-level sculpture._ The grooved upland with its cirques, or the\r\n fretted upland with its cirques, cols, horns, and comb ridges.\r\n\r\n _Low-level sculpture._ The U-shaped main valley, the hanging side\r\n valleys with their ribbon falls, the glacier staircase with its rock\r\n bars and gorges, the rounded, polished, and striated rock floor.\r\n\r\n _Deposits._ The recessional moraines of till and the valley trains of\r\n sand and gravel, the soled erratic blocks derived always from higher\r\n levels of the valley.\r\n\r\n _Lakes._ The valley moraine lakes and the chains of rock basin lakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING REFERENCES FOR CHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n Glacier movement:—\r\n\r\n L.

If\r\nthere is a surplus beyond what is needed to meet these losses, lakes\r\nhave outlets and remain fresh; their content of mineral matter is\r\nthen too slight to be detected by the palate. If, on the other hand,\r\nsupply is insufficient for overflow, continued evaporation results in a\r\nconcentration of the mineral content of the water, subject as it is to\r\ncontinual augmentation from the inflowing streams.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, there are in areas of small rainfall special\r\nweathering processes which tend to bring out the salts from the\r\ninterior of rock masses, these concentrated salts generally first\r\nappearing as a surface efflorescence which is ultimately transferred\r\nthrough the agency of wind and cloudburst to the characteristically\r\nsaline desert lakes.\r\n\r\nLake basins may be formed in many ways. Depressions of the land surface\r\nmay result from tectonic movements of the crust; they may be formed by\r\nexcavating processes; but in by far the greater number of instances\r\nthey result from the obstruction in some manner of valleys which were\r\nbefore characterized by uniformly forward grades. In relatively few\r\ncases loose materials are heaped up in such a manner as to produce\r\nfairly symmetrical basins.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 430.—Map and diagram to bring out the characteristics of newland\r\nlakes.]\r\n\r\n=Newland lakes.=—On land recently elevated from the sea, basins of\r\nlakes may be merely the inherited slight irregularities of the earlier\r\nsea floor, in which case they may be assumed to be largely the result\r\nof an irregular distribution of deposits derived from the land. Lakes\r\nof this type are especially well exhibited in Florida, and are known as\r\nnewland lakes (Fig. 430). Such lakes are exceptionally shallow, and are\r\napt to have irregular outlines and extremely low banks. Under these\r\ncircumstances, they are soon filled with a rank growth of vegetation,\r\nso that it is sometimes difficult to properly distinguish lake and\r\nmarsh.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 431.—View of the Warner Lakes, Oregon (after\r\nRussell).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 432.—Schematic diagrams to illustrate the\r\ncharacteristics of basin-range lakes.]\r\n\r\n=Basin-range lakes.=—Newland lakes may be said to have their origin in\r\nan uplift of the land and sea floor near their common margin. A lake\r\ntype dependent upon movements of the earth’s crust but within interior\r\nareas has been described as the basin-range type and is exemplified\r\nby the Warner Lakes of Oregon. In this district great rectangular\r\nblocks of the earth’s crust, which in their upper portions at least\r\nare composed of basaltic lavas, have undergone vertical adjustments\r\nin level and have been tilted so that the corresponding corners of\r\nneighboring blocks have been given a similar degree of down-tilt (Fig.\r\n431). Lakes formed in this way are of triangular outline, are bounded\r\non the two shorter sides by cliffs, but have extremely flat shores on\r\ntheir longest side. From this shore the water increases gradually in\r\ndepth and attains a maximum depth at or near the opposite angle. Such\r\nlakes naturally betray a tendency to appear in series (Fig. 432), and\r\nare unfortunately much too often illustrated on a small scale after a\r\nshower by the tilted blocks of imperfectly made cement sidewalks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 433.—Schematic diagrams of rift-valley lakes, and the rift valley\r\nof the Jordan with the Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee as remnants of a\r\nlarger lake in which their basins were included.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Rift-valley lakes.=—Another type of lake basin which has its origin\r\nin faulted block movements is known as the rift-valley lake, and is\r\nbest exemplified by the great lakes of east Central Africa. In this\r\ntype a strip of crust, many times as long as it is wide, has been\r\nrelatively sunk between the blocks on either side so as to produce a\r\ndeep rift, or what in Germany is known as a _Graben_ (trench). Such\r\na basin when occupied by water yields a lake which is long, straight,\r\ndeep, and narrow, and is in addition bounded on the sides by steep rock\r\ncliffs. At the ends the shores are generally by contrast decidedly\r\nlow. If the hard rock at the bottom of the lake could be examined, it\r\nwould be found to be of the same type as that exposed near the top of\r\nthe side cliffs. The valley of the Jordan in Palestine is a rift of\r\nthis character and was at one time occupied by a long and narrow lake\r\nof which the Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee are the existing remnants\r\n(Fig. 433).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 434.—Map showing the rift valley lakes of east Central Africa.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking examples of a rift valley lake is Lake\r\nTanganyika, while Albert Nyanza, Nyassa, and Rudolf in the same region\r\nare similar (Fig. 434).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 435.—Earthquake lakes which were formed in the flood plain of the\r\nlower Mississippi during the earthquake of 1811 (after Humphreys).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Earthquake lakes.=—The complex adjustments in level of the surface\r\nof the ground at the time of sensible earthquakes are many of them\r\nmade apparent in no other way than by the derangements of the surface\r\nwater. This is at such times impounded either in pools or in broad\r\nlakes, which inasmuch as they date from known earthquakes have been\r\ncalled “earthquake lakes”, even though in a strict sense any lake\r\nwhich has originated in earth movements might properly be regarded as\r\nan earthquake lake. To avoid unnecessary confusion, the term must,\r\nhowever, be restricted to those lakes which are known to have been\r\nformed at the time of definite earthquakes (Fig. 435). Reelfoot Lake\r\nin Tennessee, which in late years has acquired undesirable notoriety\r\nbecause of the feuds between the fishermen of the district and the\r\nconstituted authorities, is a lake more than twenty miles across\r\nand came into existence during the great earthquake of the lower\r\nMississippi valley in 1811.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Crater lakes.=—The craters of volcanic mountains are natural basins\r\nin which surface waters are certain to be collected, provided only\r\nthe supply is sufficient and seepage into the loose materials is\r\nnot excessive. Some craters, still visibly more or less active, are\r\noccupied by lakes (Fig. 436).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 436.—View of lake in Poas Crater in Costa Rica, a volcanic crater\r\nmore than half a mile across and with walls 800 feet deep. At intervals\r\nthere is an ejection of steam mixed with mud and ash after the manner\r\nof a geyser (after H. Pittier).]\r\n\r\nIn the larger number of cases in which craters become occupied by\r\nlakes, the evidence of continued activity is lacking, and it would\r\nappear in such cases that the lava of the chimney had consolidated into\r\na volcanic plug, closing the bottom of the crater. Notable groups of\r\ncrater lakes are the _Caldera_ of the Roman Campagna (Fig. 437) and\r\nthe so-called _maare_ of the Eifel about the Lower Rhine. Crater lakes\r\nare easy to recognize by their circular plan, their steep walls of\r\nvolcanic materials, and their considerable depth with a maximum near\r\nthe center.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable of these water-filled basins is Crater Lake\r\nin Oregon, which has a diameter of about six miles and is believed to\r\nhave resulted from the incaving of a great volcanic cone in the latest\r\nstage of its activity. This remarkable feature has now been made a\r\nnational park and will soon be conveniently reached by tourists and\r\ncounted one of the greatest nature wonders of the Pacific slope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 437.—Diagrams to illustrate the characteristics of crater lakes.\r\nThe Roman Campagna is a plain formed of volcanic ash, with the crater\r\nlakes of Bracciano, Vico, and Bolseno arranged on a line traversing it.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Coulée lakes.=—Far more important as lakes are those volcanic basins\r\nwhich arise from the flow of a stream of lava across the valley of a\r\nriver so as to impound its waters (Fig. 438).\r\n\r\nAt the time of the great eruption under Skaptár Jökull in 1783 the\r\nriver Skaptár and many of its tributaries were blocked by the flow of\r\nlava, which it is estimated exceeded in bulk the mass of Mont Blanc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 438.—View of Snag Lake, a _coulée_ lake with lava dam shown in\r\nmiddle distance (after Fairbanks).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Morainal lakes.=—As we have learned, the obstruction of drainage,\r\ndue to the distribution of rock débris by continental glaciers, has\r\nyielded lakes in almost countless numbers. Probably ninety per cent\r\nor more of the known lakes have had this origin, and the type is so\r\ncommon within the once glaciated regions that it forms perhaps the\r\nbest distinguishing mark of former glaciation. The hummocky surface\r\nof morainal deposits is so characteristic that the lakes of this type\r\nare never very large and are correspondingly irregular in outline.\r\nThey have often numerous islands, and their banks are formed of the\r\ncombination of rock flour and ice-worn materials known as till (Fig.\r\n439). The smallest of the morainal lakes are mere kettles on the\r\nmarginal moraine, and these rapidly become replaced by peat bogs. In\r\ncontrast with pit lakes, morainal lakes lack the steep surrounding\r\nslopes and the encircling plain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 439.—Diagrams to illustrate the characteristics\r\nof morainal lakes, and a sample map of such lakes from the glaciated\r\nregion of North America.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pit lakes.=—The so-called pit lakes have their origin in continental\r\nglaciation, and are found in groups within broad plains of glacial\r\noutwash (mainly sand and gravel), which are for this reason described\r\nas “pitted plains” (see p. 314). Those areas which lay between\r\nneighboring lobes of the ice sheet were subject to particularly heavy\r\ndeposits of outwash material, and are, in consequence, particularly\r\nlikely to be occupied by pit lakes. As has been pointed out in an\r\nearlier section, the water derived from surface melting within the\r\nmarginal portions of a continental glacier descends to the bottom\r\nin the crevasses and thereafter flows in an ice tunnel under the\r\nsame conditions as water flowing in a pipe. Having in most cases a\r\nconsiderable head at the outer margin of the ice, this water may rise\r\nand issue well above the lower ice layers and so cover a portion of the\r\nice margin beneath sand and gravel (Fig. 440). Separated blocks, often\r\nof massive proportions, are thus buried beneath nonconducting materials\r\nby which they are long protected from further melting. Eventually,\r\nhowever, with the approach of still milder climates they disappear,\r\nthus causing the overlying sand and gravel to descend and form a pit of\r\nsteep walls similar to the sawdust pits over melted ice blocks within\r\nour storehouses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 440.—Diagram to show the manner of formation of\r\npit lakes.]\r\n\r\nPit lakes are thus easily recognized by their occurrence usually in\r\ngroups within a plain of glacial outwash and by their characteristic\r\nbanks inclined at the angle of repose of such materials (Fig. 441).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 441.—Diagrams to illustrate the characteristics of\r\npit lakes and a sample map from the glaciated region of North America.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Glint or colk lakes.=—It has been found to be true of existing\r\ncontinental glaciers that where their mass has been held back by\r\na mountain wall, their current at the portals within this rampart\r\nbecomes greatly accelerated. Though the upper layers of the glacier\r\nin the vicinity may move forward with a velocity of but an inch per\r\nday, the current within the outlet may be as much as seven hundred\r\nor a thousand times as great. In many respects these conditions are\r\nsimilar to those about the raceway of a reservoir where the near-by\r\nsurface of the water is lowered by the indraught of the outlet and the\r\ncurrent in the raceway is so accelerated that, unless protected, the\r\nbottom of the race is carried away and a basin excavated which extends\r\na short distance both above and below the position of the dam. In\r\nHolland such basins hollowed out beneath breaks in the dykes are known\r\nas colks. Basins which were excavated beneath the glacier outlets by\r\na similar process would not be open to our inspection until after the\r\nice had disappeared from the region; but it is most significant that\r\nin Scandinavia, where the Pleistocene continental glacier, advancing\r\nwestward from the Baltic, was held in check by the escarpment at the\r\nNorwegian boundary (the _glint_), lake basins have been excavated\r\nin hard rock whose walls show the abrading and polishing which are\r\ncharacteristic of glacial sculpture, and whose positions are such that\r\nthey lie beneath the former outlets partly above and in part below the\r\nline of the escarpment. Their position in reference to the rampart and\r\nto the former outlets is brought out in Fig. 442. The largest of the\r\nglint lakes of this series is Torneträsk in northern Lapland (see p.\r\n277 and Fig. 443).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 442.—Diagram to show the manner of formation of glint or outlet\r\nlakes where the continental glacier of Scandinavia issued from the\r\nBaltic depression through portals in its mountain rampart.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 443.—Map showing a series of glint lakes which lie across the\r\ninternational boundary of Sweden and Norway.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ice-dam lakes.=—Whenever a continental glacier, either in advancing\r\nits front or in retiring, lies across the lines of drainage upon their\r\ndownstream side, water is impounded along the ice front so as to form\r\nice-dam lakes. Such lakes are found to-day in Greenland and in the\r\nsouthern Andes, and similar bodies of water of far greater size and\r\nimportance came into existence in Pleistocene times each time that the\r\ncontinental glaciers of northern North America and Europe advanced\r\nupon or retired from suitably directed river systems. Thus above the\r\nBaltic depression, when the ice front lay to the eastward of the main\r\nwatershed, each easterly sloping valley was obstructed by the ice and\r\noccupied by an ice-dam lake (Fig. 444), the beaches of which may all be\r\ntraced to-day (Fig. 445).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 444.—Ice-dam lakes (in black) between the front of the late\r\nPleistocene glacier of northern Europe and the divide near the\r\nNorwegian boundary (after G. de Geer).]\r\n\r\nOne side of each ice-dam lake is formed by an ice cliff at the glacier\r\nfront, and if the region is relatively flat, the remaining shores\r\nare likely to be formed by a marginal moraine which the glacier has\r\nabandoned in its retreat. In their smaller stages, therefore, ice-dam\r\nlakes on prairie country have the form of a crescent, which is the more\r\npronounced because the waves by their attack upon the ice front flatten\r\nthe curvature of its outline (see Fig. 360, p. 330).\r\n\r\nThe life of an ice-dam lake is begun and ended in important changes\r\nof glacier outline, and after the draining of lakes by this process\r\nthe land shores may be traced in beaches, and the ice margin by a\r\nwater-laid moraine of low relief (Fig. 359, p. 330).\r\n\r\nA much smaller but in many respects similar ice-dam lake is to-day to\r\nbe seen at the side of the Great Aletsch glacier, a mountain glacier of\r\nSwitzerland. The traveler who makes the easy ascent of the Eggishorn\r\nmay look directly down upon this crescent-shaped lake with its ice\r\ncliff on the glacier side (see Fig. 446).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 445.—Wave-cut terrace at an elevation of 177.5 meters above sea\r\non the southern slope of the northern Dala valley north of Baggedalen\r\nin Sweden.

D. Scott).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Glacier lobe lakes.=—Upon the sites of the former lobes of the\r\nPleistocene glacier of North America are found the basins of the\r\nLaurentian River system, the largest freshwater lakes in the world.\r\nThere has been much controversy concerning the manner of formation\r\nof these lakes, but the view which has seemed to have the largest\r\nfollowing is that they were excavated by the eroding action of the\r\ncontinental glacier over the drainage basins of former rivers. It is\r\nbut one phase of the long controversy between opposing schools, which\r\nhave advocated on the one hand the efficiency of glacier ice as an\r\neroding agent, and upon the other its supposed protection from the\r\nweathering processes. The positions and the outlines of the several\r\nlakes of the series sufficiently proclaim their connection with the\r\nformer glacial lobes, and the name which we have adopted leaves the\r\nexact manner of their formation a still open question. The recognition\r\nof the importance of the glacial anticyclone, in giving shape to the\r\nglacier surface and in effecting a transfer of snow from the central to\r\nthe marginal portions, has had the effect of emphasizing the relative\r\nimportance of erosion under the marginal and lobate portions. Thus\r\nthe importance of ice lobes has been greatly accentuated, though this\r\napplies only to the shaping of the basins and not in any important\r\nway to the impounding of the present waters. The present Laurentian\r\nLakes owe their existence to the elevation by successive uplifts of\r\nthe country to the northward and eastward, since the glacier retired\r\nfrom the lake region. When the ice front lay to the northward of the\r\nOttawa River, the discharge of the upper lakes was by a channel through\r\nNipissing River and Lake and thence down the Ottawa River to a gulf in\r\nthe lower St. Lawrence. The uplift of the land has had the effect of\r\nraising a barrier where the former outlet existed, and diverting the\r\nwaters to a roundabout channel by way of Detroit and Lake Erie (see\r\nFig. 365, p. 335).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 447.—Diagrams to illustrate the arrangement and the characters of\r\nrock-basin lakes, together with a map of such lakes from the Bighorn\r\nMountains in Wyoming.]\r\n\r\n=Rock-basin lakes.=—The reversed grades which develop in a valley\r\ndeepened by mountain glaciers—the back-tilted treads of the cascade\r\nstairway (see p. 376)—furnish a series of basins hollowed in rock which\r\nare strung along the course of the valley like pearls upon a thread,\r\nor, far better, like the larger beads in a rosary (Fig. 447). This\r\ncharacteristic arrangement accounts for the name “Paternoster Lakes”\r\nwhich has sometimes been applied to them in Europe. Their positions in\r\nseries within U-shaped mountain valleys, and their rock shores with\r\ncharacteristically smoothed and striated surfaces, make them easy of\r\ndetermination. In the higher portions of the valley, where the treads\r\nof the cascade stairway are relatively narrow, such lakes are often\r\napproximately circular in outline, but in the lower levels and upon\r\nwider treads they may be ribbon-like, though lakes of this type are to\r\na large extent replaced in the lower levels by the valley moraine type\r\nor a combination of the two.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 448.—Convict Lake, a lake behind a moraine dam\r\nwithin a glaciated valley of the Sierra Nevadas, California (after a\r\nphotograph by Fairbanks).]\r\n\r\n=Valley moraine lakes.=—The recessional moraines which mark the halting\r\nstations of mountain glaciers, while retiring up their valleys,\r\nform dams in the later river and so produce a type of lake which is\r\nin contrast with the morainal lakes which result from continental\r\nglaciation. They may, therefore, be distinguished by the name _valley\r\nmoraine lakes_. Their positions on the bed of a U-shaped mountain\r\nvalley, and the glacial materials which compose the dams, are\r\nsufficient for their identification (Fig. 448). Moraine Lake and Lake\r\nLouise in the Canadian Rockies are typical examples. Rock basin and\r\nvalley moraine lakes may occur in alternation or combined in mountain\r\nvalleys.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 449.—Lake basins produced by successive slides from the steep\r\nwalls of a glaciated mountain valley (after Russell).]\r\n\r\n=Landslide lakes.=—The sheer-walled valleys which are carved by\r\nmountain glaciers are too steep to long retain their perpendicularity\r\nwhen the support of the glacier has been removed. Aided by the ever\r\npresent joint planes, which admit water to the rock, they succumb to\r\nfrost action, and further give way in avalanches whenever the rock\r\nis of sufficiently porous material to become saturated with water.\r\nLandslides sometimes occur successively until the original valley wall\r\nhas been replaced by a terraced slope. The treads of the steps in\r\nthis terrace have generally a backward-sloping grade, so that basins\r\nare formed to be filled by relatively long and narrow lakes or by\r\nsuccessions of small pools (Fig. 449 and plate 23 B).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 450.—Lake Garda, a border lake upon the site of a piedmont apron\r\nat the margin of the Alpine highland (after Penck and Brückner).]\r\n\r\nWhen the avalanched material is so disposed as to dam the valley, much\r\nlarger lakes of this type come into existence. During an earthquake\r\nwhich occurred on January 25, 1348, there was a landslide within the\r\nvalley of the Gail, Carinthia, which destroyed seventeen villages and\r\nproduced a lake which even to-day is represented by a great marsh.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Border lakes.=—Whenever mountain glaciers push out their fronts\r\nbeyond the borders of the mountain range by which they are nourished,\r\nthey spread upon the foreland in broad aprons about which morainic\r\naccumulations are particularly heavy. This elevation of morainal\r\nwalls about the margins of the aprons yields natural basins that are\r\noccupied by lakes so soon as the glacier retires its front within the\r\nvalley. Because such lakes are found at the borders of upland districts\r\nthey have been called _border lakes_. The beautiful Lakes Constance,\r\nLucerne, Maggiore, Lugano, Como, and Garda (Fig. 450), on the borders\r\nof the Alpine highland, are all of this type.\r\n\r\n┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n│   PLATE 23.                                                       │\r\n│                                                                   │\r\n│ [Illustration: _A._ View of the American Fall at Niagara, showing │\r\n│ the accumulation of rocks beneath (after Grabau).]                │\r\n│                                                                   │\r\n│ [Illustration: _B._ Crystal Lake, a landslide lake in Colorado.   │\r\n│ (_Photograph by Howland Bancroft._)]                              │\r\n└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ox-bow lakes.=—The cutting off of a meander within the flood plain of\r\na river yields a lake which is of horseshoe (ox-bow) outline and lies\r\ngenerally with low banks within a plain composed of river silt. Before\r\nseparating from the parent stream the meander had begun to silt up,\r\nespecially at the ends. Ox-bow lakes are, however, relatively deep near\r\nthe convex shore and correspondingly shallow toward the concave margin\r\n(Fig. 451).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 451.—Diagrams to bring out the characteristics of\r\nox-bow lakes, together with a map of such lakes from the flood plain of\r\nthe Arkansas River.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 452.—Diagrammatic section to illustrate the formation of\r\nsaucer-like basins between the levees of streams flowing in a flood\r\nplain.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Saucer lakes.=—As we have learned, a river meandering in its flood\r\nplain has banks which are higher than the average level of the plain,\r\nfor the reason that at flood time the main current of the stream still\r\npersists in the channel, thus allowing the burden of sediment to be\r\ndropped in the relatively slack water upon its margin. Because of these\r\nnatural embankments or levees, tributary streams are often compelled\r\nto flow long distances in nearly parallel direction before effecting\r\na junction. Between the trunk stream and its tributaries, likewise\r\nbounded by levees, and between streams and the valley walls, there thus\r\nexist low basins which are more or less saucer-shaped (Fig. 452). At\r\nflood time, when the levees are overflowed or crevassed, water enters\r\nthese depressions, and an additional supply may be derived from the\r\nwalls of the valley. Good illustrations of such lakes are furnished\r\nby the flood plain of the former river Warren near the banks of the\r\npresent Minnesota River (Fig. 453).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 453.—Saucer lakes upon the bed of the former river\r\nWarren (from the Minneapolis sheet, U. S. G. S.).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Crescentic levee lakes.=—As we approach the delta of a river, the\r\nsize and importance of the levee increases, and here a new type of\r\nlevee lake may develop in series (Fig. 454). At flood time the levee\r\nis breached near the point of sharpest curvature on the convex side\r\n(Fig. 454 _a_). When the waters are subsiding, the current is kept\r\naway from the old channel by the rising grade of the levee as well as\r\nby the inertia of the current, and an entrance to the old channel is\r\nfirst found below the next change in curvature of the meander, since\r\nhere scour becomes effective in cutting through the levee. The new\r\nchannel is thus established in the form of a loop inclosing the old\r\none, and the process of levee building now erects a wall about the\r\nterritory newly acquired by the meander. This territory has the form\r\nof a crescent, and when occupied by water produces a crescentic levee\r\nlake often joined to its neighbors in series. The abandoned channel now\r\nclosed at both ends by levees may be occupied by water to produce a\r\nsubordinate ribbon type of curving trench (Fig. 454 _b_, _c_).\r\n\r\nThe importance of levees in obstructing drainage to form lakes is only\r\nbeginning to be appreciated. It has quite recently been shown that\r\nwhen trunk streams are greatly swollen and burdened with sediment\r\nwhile flowing from a receding continental glacier, they may build such\r\nhigh levees as to aggrade their tributary streams above the junctions,\r\neven producing reversed grades and so impounding the waters to form\r\nextensive lakes. During the “ice age” lakes of this type were formed\r\nin Illinois and Kentucky rivers just above their junctions with the\r\nOhio. The old lake floor with its eastern shore line and its protruding\r\nislands is easily made out upon the new topographic maps of Kentucky.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 454.—Levee lakes developed concentrically in series within\r\nmeanders of a stream tributary to the Mississippi and flowing upon its\r\ndelta plain. _b_ and _c_ are examples of the ribbon type of levee lake\r\ndue to occupation of the abandoned river channel. The larger number of\r\nlakes, of which Sip Lake and Texas Lake are examples, have the form of\r\ncrescents and lie between abandoned levees (from recent map of U. S. G.\r\nS.).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Raft lakes.=—Within humid regions the flood plains of our larger\r\nrivers are generally forested, and as the river swings from side to\r\nside in its perpetual meanderings, the timber which grows upon the\r\nconvex side of each meander is progressively undermined by the river\r\nand felled upon its bank. The prostrate trees remain upon the banks\r\nduring the low water of the summer season, to be gathered up at the\r\ntime of flood in the next spring season. It is log jams thus acquired\r\nwhich so generally block the main channel of a river and turn the\r\ncurrent across the neck of the meander when cut-offs occur with the\r\nformation of ox-bow lakes. When the mass of timber thus gathered up\r\nby the river is excessive, as, for example, within the flood plain of\r\nthe Red River of Arkansas and Louisiana, huge log rafts are produced\r\nwhich dam up the river so effectively as to produce temporary lakes.\r\nThe impounded waters soon find an outlet over the levee at some point\r\nhigher up the river, and the waters flowing off through the timbered\r\nbottom lands, other logs are caught by the standing timber as in a\r\nweir. A second dam is thus formed which is separated from the initial\r\none by open water, and in this way the driftwood dam acquires enormous\r\nproportions as it gradually moves up the river. After a period of\r\nperhaps a century or more, the lower sections of the jam become decayed\r\nand dislodged so as to float down the river.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 455.—Raft lakes along the banks of the Red River in Arkansas and\r\nLouisiana at their fullest recorded development (after A. C. Veatch, U.\r\nS. G. S.).]\r\n\r\nIn the lower Red River a great raft of alternating jams and open water\r\nreached a length of about one hundred and sixty miles and moved up\r\nthe river at the average rate of something less than a mile per year.\r\nWithin the limits of the dam all tributary streams were blocked, so\r\nthat secondary lakes were formed in a double fringe about the main\r\nriver (Fig. 455). The great raft which formed here in the latter part\r\nof the fifteenth century has now at the beginning of the twentieth\r\nbeen largely removed and measures have been adopted to prevent its\r\nre-formation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 456.—The Swiss lakes Thun and Brienz, formed by deltas at the\r\njunction of streams tributary to a steep-walled valley.]\r\n\r\n=Side-delta lakes.=—It is characteristic of river drainage that the\r\ntributary streams enter the main valley on steeper gradients than the\r\ntrunk stream at the point of junction. Wherever the difference in\r\nvelocity of the two streams at the junction is large, and the side\r\nstream is charged with sediment, a delta will be formed at the mouth\r\nof the tributary stream. Such deltas push out from the shore and\r\nmay eventually block the main channel so as to form a more or less\r\nsausage-shaped expansion of the river—a side-delta lake. Traverse and\r\nBig Stone Lakes in the valley of the Warren River in Minnesota have\r\nbeen formed in this way (Fig. 354, p. 326). Lakes Thun and Brienz in\r\nthe Swiss Alps are of similar origin, the beautiful city of Interlaken\r\nbeing built upon the delta plain over the valley of the earlier river\r\n(Fig. 456). The Mississippi has similarly been expanded to form Lake\r\nPepin above the delta at the mouth of the Chippewa River.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 457.—Delta lakes formed at the mouth of the Mississippi through\r\nthe junction of the levees of radiating distributaries with the shore\r\nof the estuary (after Berghaus).]\r\n\r\n=Delta lakes.=—A somewhat different type of delta lake has been\r\nformed in Louisiana, where the “father of waters” discharges into the\r\ngulf. Here the various distributaries radiate from the main channel\r\nto produce the “bird-foot” delta type and the toes in this foot by\r\ntheir junction with the banks which outline the ancient estuary, have\r\nseparated in succession a series of basins that before were in direct\r\nconnection with the sea (Fig. 457). Lake Pontchartrain is the largest\r\nof this series, while the so-called Lake Borgne is in process of\r\nseparation.\r\n\r\nWhere large deltas push out from the shore into the open sea, the\r\nlevees which border the individual distributaries are attacked by the\r\nwaves and their materials are transported by the shore currents and\r\nbuilt into barriers. These barriers cut off the re-entrants between\r\nneighboring distributaries so as to produce lagoons or lakes (Fig. 458).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 458.—A type of delta lakes formed by levees in part destroyed\r\nand built into barriers on the margin of the delta of the Nile (after\r\nSupan).]\r\n\r\nA type of delta lake, which more resembles the side-delta lake above\r\ndescribed, has formed at the mouth of the Colorado River, where it\r\nenters the Gulf of Lower California. The Imperial Valley lying to the\r\nnorth of this delta is the desiccated floor of the earlier Gulf of\r\nLower California which has been captured from the sea by the delta\r\nof the Colorado. The rampart of mountains, by which this valley is\r\nsurrounded, has cut it off from any water supply derived from clouds,\r\nand its waters being no longer renewed from the sea, the region has\r\npassed through a period of desiccation which has left the Salton\r\nSink as the only existing remnant of the earlier lagoon. It will be\r\nremembered that careless operations in diverting distributaries of the\r\nColorado recently reversed this process so that the waters rose in the\r\nvalley, and expensive emergency operations were necessary in order to\r\nagain turn the waters of the Colorado into their accustomed channels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 459.—Diagrams to illustrate the characteristics of\r\nbarrier lakes, with an example from the southern coast of the Island of\r\nNantucket.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Barrier lakes.=—The Salton Sink illustrates a type of lake which is\r\nformed at the border of the sea through the erection of some kind of\r\nbarrier which captures a small area of the ocean’s surface. Though such\r\nlakes may be properly described as strand lakes, it is usually at the\r\nmouth of a river that the process becomes effective. The common type\r\nof _barrier lakes_ is found developed on most ragged coast lines where\r\nthe shore currents have formed first bars and later barriers at the\r\nmouths of the estuaries (Fig. 459). Such embankments are usually gently\r\ncurving or crescent shaped and are composed of sand or shingle which\r\npresents a steep landward and a gradual seaward slope.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 460.—Dune lakes on the coast of France (after Berghaus).]\r\n\r\n=Dune lakes.=—Within the narrow strips of shore in which all the fine\r\nsoil that could be available for plant life has been washed away by\r\nthe waves, beach sand is exposed to the direct action of the winds. In\r\ntime of storm the sand is picked up and after drifting in the wind is\r\ncollected in long ridges parallel to the shore. Constantly traveling\r\nalong shore, these dunes block the mouths of rivers and thus produce a\r\nseries of lakes such as are indicated in Fig. 460.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sink lakes.=—Another class of lakes are due either directly or\r\nindirectly to the work of underground waters. In districts which are\r\nunderlain by limestone, the surface water descending along the joints\r\nof the limestone may widen these passageways through solution of the\r\nrock and at lower levels flow on the floors of caverns eaten out by the\r\nsame process on bedding planes of the formation. At the intersections\r\nof joints, more or less circular shafts known as “swallow-holes” go\r\ndown to the caves from the surface. Locally, also the cavern roofs\r\ngive way so as to choke the galleries with rubble and leave a basin at\r\nthe surface which has an irregular but generally a more or less oval\r\noutline. If sufficiently clogged at the bottom by finer rock débris,\r\nthese basins become occupied by small lakes which are known as sinks,\r\nand constitute one of the best surface indications of a limestone\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 461.—Sink lakes in Florida, with a schematic\r\ndiagram to illustrate the manner of their formation (map from U. S. G.\r\nS.).]\r\n\r\n=Karst lakes—poljen.=—In the limestone country to the north and\r\neast of the Adriatic Sea—the so-called Karst region—there are many\r\ninteresting features which are directly traceable to the solution\r\nof the country rock. Here all the surface water descends in certain\r\ndistricts along the widened joint planes so that the drainage is\r\nlargely subterranean. The so-called _dolines_ or sinks of very regular\r\nand symmetrical forms resembling deep bowls cover a large part of the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThe entire country is, moreover, faulted in the most intricate fashion\r\ninto many rift valleys. The drainage being so largely subterranean,\r\nthese downthrown blocks of crust, the so-called _poljen_, become\r\nflooded at certain seasons of the year when the subterranean passages\r\nbecome choked or are too small to carry away all the water. A seasonal\r\nlake of this character is the Zirknitz Lake (p. 189).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Playa lakes.=—It is the law of the desert that the arid region be\r\nwalled in by mountains. This encircling rampart forces the clouds to\r\nrise, and by robbing them of their moisture leaves the desert dry and\r\nbarren. Those waters which fall upon the inner margin of the ranges\r\ndrain toward the interior of this pan-like depression and are not\r\nreturned to the sea—the desert is without an outlet. Infrequent though\r\nthey be, the desert rains are of the cloudburst type and in the hills\r\ndevelop torrents whose waters, emerging upon the desert floor, develop\r\nlakes in the space of a few minutes or at most hours. In the hot and\r\ndry atmosphere the waters of these shallow basins may be sucked up in\r\nthe space of a few hours but reappear in the same basins at the time\r\nof the next succeeding cloudburst. Such ephemeral lakes are known as\r\nplayas.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Salines.=—Desert lakes more favored in their supply of water may be\r\nrelatively long lived and persist for periods measured in years or\r\ncenturies. Such lakes are, however, extremely sensitive to climatic\r\nchanges (see p. 198).\r\n\r\nFor the reason that they have no outlet the waters of desert lakes\r\nbecome salt through continued evaporation. They are, therefore, spoken\r\nof as _salines_. Lake Bonneville, so long as it discharged its waters\r\nover the sill of the Red Rock Pass, must have remained fresh; but when\r\nthe level of its waters had fallen below this outlet, its waters became\r\nsalt and the content increased as the volume diminished.\r\n\r\nThe shallow basins upon the floors of desert lakes may have come into\r\nexistence in various ways; but it would appear that the irregular\r\nremoval of the soil by the winds, modified as this is by differences\r\nin composition of the rock materials and by vegetable growth, and the\r\ndeposition of sand by the same agent, are by far the most important.\r\nMany of the types of tectonic and volcanic lakes which have been\r\ndescribed are characteristic of humid and arid regions alike.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Alluvial-dam lakes.=—Within the mountains upon the desert borders,\r\nthe alluvial fans which form at the mouths of valleys, because of the\r\ncharacteristic cloudburst, sometimes obstruct a main valley at the\r\njunction with its tributaries. By this process the waters of the main\r\nriver are impounded in essentially the same manner as are the rivers of\r\nhumid regions by the deltas of their tributaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Résumé.=—The types of lakes which we have now considered are arranged\r\nbelow in tabular form so as to show their relationship to important\r\ngeological processes. While not complete, the list includes the more\r\nimportant classes, as well as others which, while not of common\r\noccurrence, are yet of interest in giving further illustration to the\r\nprocesses which have been treated in earlier chapters.\r\n\r\nBy giving careful attention to criteria which have been above\r\nsuggested, it should be possible in the greater number of instances at\r\nleast to determine whether any lake which is visited has had its origin\r\nin one or another of the processes described.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF LAKES\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tectonic Lakes_                   _Volcanic Lakes_\r\n\r\n  Newland lakes                      Crater lakes\r\n  Basin-range lakes                  Coulée lakes\r\n  Rift-valley lakes\r\n  Earthquake lakes\r\n\r\n_Continental Glaciation Lakes_     _Mountain Glaciation Lakes_\r\n\r\n  Morainal lakes                     Rock-basin lakes\r\n  Pit lakes                          Valley moraine lakes\r\n  Glint or colk lakes                Landslide lakes\r\n  Ice-dam lakes                      Border lakes\r\n  Glacier-lobe lakes\r\n\r\n\r\n_River Lakes_                      _Strand Lakes_\r\n\r\n  Ox-bow lakes                       Barrier lakes\r\n  Saucer lakes                       Dune lakes\r\n  Crescentic levee lakes\r\n  Raft lakes\r\n  Side-delta lakes\r\n  Delta lakes\r\n\r\n_Ground Water Lakes_               _Desert Lakes_\r\n\r\n  Sink lakes                         Playa lakes\r\n  Karst lakes—_poljen_               Salines\r\n                                     Alluvial dam lakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING REFERENCES FOR CHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n General:—\r\n\r\n I.

The carrying of\r\nsediment in suspension depends, as we know, upon the velocity of the\r\ncurrent, and as this is checked where it reaches the lake margin, all\r\ncoarser material is at once deposited to form a delta, while the finer\r\nsediments are held longer in suspension and finally settle in thin\r\nlayers over the entire bottom of the lake. Clay deposits surrounded by\r\ncoarser sediments are thus characteristic of filled lake basins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 462.—Map of the Arve and the upper Rhone to show\r\nthe importance of Lake Geneva as a settling basin of the larger stream.]\r\n\r\nHow waters are clarified by their passage through a lake is indicated\r\nby a comparison of a river system such as the St. Lawrence, with\r\na river like the Missouri and Mississippi. Not only are the lower\r\nstretches of the St. Lawrence in striking contrast with the muddy\r\nfloods of the Missouri and Mississippi; but the delta, which is so\r\nremarkable a feature in the Mississippi, has no counterpart in the\r\nnorthern river.\r\n\r\nThe most noteworthy examples of settling are, however, furnished by\r\nthe lakes of Switzerland, for the reason that SWISS rivers are heavily\r\ncharged with rock flour produced beneath the numerous glaciers at the\r\nvalley heads, and, further, because these rivers descend with turbulent\r\ncurrents to near the borders of the larger lakes. To look out upon the\r\nmurky waters of the upper Rhone, where they enter Lake Geneva near\r\nVilleneuve, and then to watch the flood of crystal water which issues\r\nfrom the lake and passes under the bridge at Geneva, is an object\r\nlesson which no traveling student should miss (Fig. 462). Yet even more\r\ninstructive is a visit to the _Bois de la Bâtie_ at the junction of\r\nthis clear stream with the Arve, a half hour’s walk only below Geneva.\r\nThe waters of the Arve have come on a steep descent directly from the\r\nglaciers of the Mont Blanc district, and as they meet the cleared\r\nwaters of the Rhone, they flow beside them down the common valley\r\nwithout mingling. Dull and opaque, the Arve waters can be discerned for\r\na long distance as a white belt against the left bank of the river,\r\nsharply defined against the blue reflecting surface of the Rhone waters\r\n(Fig. 463). Upon the banks of the Arve, just above its junction, a\r\ncement manufactory has been established to utilize the clays which are\r\nhere deposited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 463.—View looking upstream across the opaque waters of the Arve\r\nto the clear reflecting surface of the Rhone. To the right across the\r\nArve is seen the cement works for recovering the Arve sediments.]\r\n\r\nWherever lakes are contained in long and narrow valleys, the greater\r\npart of the tributary drainage enters at the upper end, and the delta\r\nwhich there forms extends from bank to bank. As it continues to advance\r\ninto the lake, the earlier water basin is gradually transformed into a\r\nlevel plain of delta deposit, a feature so common as to be deserving\r\nof a special name. The Scottish lochs, which are lakes of this type,\r\nare each extended in a longer or shorter delta plain described as a\r\n_strath_, and this local term may well be given a general application\r\n(frontispiece). The city of Ithaca, the seat of Cornell University, is\r\nbuilt upon a strath at the head of Lake Cayuga, and numberless Scottish\r\nand Swiss hamlets have been located upon such fertile plains (Fig. 464).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 464.—The village of Poschiavo in eastern Switzerland, built upon\r\na strath at the head of Lake Poschiavo.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Drawing off of water by erosion of outlet.=—Next in importance to\r\nthe filling up of lake basins as a factor in their early extinction is\r\nthe cutting down of their channels of outflow. Whenever the walls of\r\nthe outlet are cut in rock, this draining process is apt to be slow,\r\nfor the reason that the outlet stream is of filtered water and so\r\nlacks the necessary cutting tools. By far the larger number of lakes\r\nare, however, held back by dams of loose drift deposits laid down by\r\nthe earlier continental glaciers; and so the very clarity of the water\r\npromotes the erosion of the outlet by allowing the stream’s full burden\r\nof sediment to be lifted and then removed from the channel.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The pulling in of headlands and the cutting off of bays.=—The removal\r\nof projecting headlands by wave action, though it increases the area of\r\nthe lake, yet it decreases directly the volume of lake water through\r\nformation of the built terrace, and indirectly in far larger measure\r\nthrough the transformation of bays into quiet lagoons within which the\r\nextinguishing process of peat growth is set in operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lake extinction by peat growth.=—The first condition for the growth\r\nof lake vegetation is quiet water. Within small lakes, such as the\r\nkettle basins upon moraines, aquatic vegetation develops rapidly,\r\nand bogs of peat might almost be included among the most important\r\ndistinguishing marks of a glaciated country. Within larger lakes it is\r\nonly after barrier beaches have been thrown across the mouths of the\r\nbays to form natural breakwaters for the waves that this process of\r\nlake extinction by peat growth can become effective.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 465.—View of the floating bog and surrounding zones of vegetation\r\nin a small glacial lake of the Yellowstone National Park (after a\r\nphotograph by Fairbanks).]\r\n\r\nMany erroneous notions are still held concerning the prime importance\r\nof sphagnum in peat formation, owing to the peculiar local conditions\r\nunder which the early studies were made. Within the glaciated districts\r\nof the United States, the formation of peat involves the successive\r\ngrowths of a number of zones of vegetation and the formation of a\r\nfloating bog which advances into the lake from the shores, followed\r\nin turn by belts of low shrubs, tamaracks, and lastly deciduous trees\r\n(Fig. 465).\r\n\r\nIn most cases the first plants to develop in a quiet lake are the water\r\nlilies, though these are sometimes preceded by chara and floating\r\nbladderwort. Next behind the water lilies come the sedges, which form a\r\nmat of floating bog by their grasslike stems sinking down in the water\r\nand being there interwoven with the rhizomes below. This mat of sedge\r\nis often so firm that cattle may advance upon it to the water’s edge,\r\nbut it is separated by a layer of water from the bed of growing peat\r\nat the bottom of the lake (Fig. 466). This bed of peat appears to grow\r\nupward toward the surface and become joined to the shore end of the\r\nfloating bog by decaying vegetation which is dropped from the bottom of\r\nthe mat above.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 466.—Diagram to show how small lakes are\r\ntransformed into peat bogs (after C. A. Davis).]\r\n\r\nIn order behind the floating bog come the advanced plants of the\r\nconifer group, with sphagnum and low shrub here upon a peat base\r\nextending to the lake bottom. Behind the belt of shrubs arise the\r\ntamaracks and spruces, and lastly, toward the shore, come the deciduous\r\ntrees and especially poplars, maples, and marginal willows. Upon the\r\nmargin of the basin there is usually a low trench, or “fosse”, filled\r\nwith water during wet seasons, as a result, no doubt, of seasonal\r\ninwash that does not reach the residual lake toward the center of the\r\nbasin.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Extinction of lakes in desert regions.=—In arid regions there are\r\nspecial causes of lake extinction. Thus the blowing in of sand and dust\r\ncarried for long distances in the air, a by no means negligible factor\r\neven in humid regions, here assumes large importance. The now exposed\r\nbasins of extinct desert lakes afford the evidence, however, of an even\r\ngreater factor of extinction, in climatic change. The clouds, which\r\nat one time found their way into the drainage basin of a lake, may\r\nlater through the rise of a mountain barrier be cut off, and so with\r\nreduced water supply a period of lake desiccation is begun. When, in\r\nthis process of drying up, the lake level has fallen below that of the\r\noutlet, the saline content of the waters begins to increase, and later\r\na stage is reached, as in Great Salt Lake, when the sodium salts are\r\nprecipitated. When the lake has become extinct, these deposits remain\r\nas a witness to the changed climatic condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The rôle of lakes in the economy of nature.=—It is natural, in\r\nconsidering the extinction of lakes, to give some attention to the\r\nrôle which they play in the economy of nature. That lakes filter the\r\nwater of rivers, and prevent the formation of important delta deposits,\r\nhas already been noticed. A curious exception to this general rule is\r\nfurnished by the great delta at the head of Lake St. Clair, just below\r\nthe outlet of Lake Huron. This anomaly is, however, explained by the\r\npeculiar currents of Lake Huron, which are so directed as to sweep the\r\nbeach sand into the swift current of the outlet, to be deposited in the\r\nquiet waters of Lake St. Clair (Fig. 467).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 467.—Map to show anomalous position of the delta in Lake St.\r\nClair, due to the peculiar currents in Lake Huron (after maps by Cole).]\r\n\r\nAs regulators of the flow of rivers, lakes perform an important\r\nfunction. Such disastrous floods as are characteristic of the spring\r\nseason within the basin of the lower Mississippi could not occur in the\r\nlower St. Lawrence, for the reason that the great basins of the lakes\r\nserve as distributing reservoirs. The annual floods, upon which the\r\nagriculture of Egypt depends, are explained by the flood waters from\r\nthe high mountains of Abyssinia entering the Nile _below_ the lakes of\r\nits upper basin.\r\n\r\nIn one further respect large inland bodies of water have an important\r\nfunction as regulators. It is the property of water to respond but\r\nslowly to the variations in the quantity of heat which reaches the\r\nearth’s surface from the sun. A larger quantity of heat must be\r\nadded to or abstracted from a body of water, in order to change its\r\ntemperature by one degree, than would be required for a like change in\r\nthe same bulk of earth or rock. Thus bodies of water by more slowly\r\nacquiring the summer’s heat retard the coming spring, and by storing\r\nup this energy and carrying it over into the autumn the warm season is\r\nprolonged and early frosts prevented. The fruit belts about the lower\r\nGreat Lakes are thus dependent upon this regulating property of the\r\nlake waters. The discomfort of the long spring of raw weather is thus\r\ncompensated by an unusually salubrious harvest season.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ice ramparts on lake shores.=—Small ridges known as ice ramparts are\r\nformed upon lake shores by the action of lake ice, though subject to\r\nso many qualifying conditions that the range of their occurrence is\r\nsomewhat limited. Within districts where a winter ice cover of some\r\nthickness is formed, the shores of lakes are apt to present ridges of\r\nbowlders parallel to and near the water’s edge, and such lakes have\r\nsometimes become known as “wall lakes” (Fig. 468).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 468.—A bowlder wall upon the shore of a small lake in the\r\nAdirondacks of New York.]\r\n\r\nIn many cases these small ridges have been formed at the time of the\r\nspring “break up” of the ice; for the ice cover, when once loosened,\r\nis drifted in great rafts first against one shore, and later, with a\r\nchange of wind direction, against another. Under the impact of such\r\nheavy rafts, the half-submerged bowlders near the shore are forced up\r\nthe beach until they lie in a ridge or bowlder wall.\r\n\r\nAt other times such bowlder walls, and far more interesting ridges as\r\nwell, result from a kind of ice shove independent of the wind, but\r\ncaused by expansion within the ice itself during a sudden rise of\r\ntemperature of the surrounding air. Such ice ramparts require for their\r\nexplanation a consideration of the sequence of events from the time the\r\nice cover closes the lakes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 469.—Diagrams to show the effect of ice shove in\r\nproducing ice ramparts upon the shores of lakes (after Buckley with a\r\nslight modification).]\r\n\r\nThe first lake ice of early winter forms in most cases with air\r\ntemperatures a few degrees only below the freezing point of the water.\r\nWhen later a severe “cold wave” arrives, the ice cover is contracted\r\nand becomes too small for the lake surface. To this contraction it\r\nyields and opens cracks up which the water rises, and in the prevailing\r\nlow temperature this water is quickly frozen and the lake cover again\r\nmade complete. Skaters are familiar with the opening of these cracks\r\nand the loud “roaring” which accompanies it on cold mornings, the sharp\r\nskate runners sometimes starting a crack in the strained ice, as does a\r\nlight scratch upon glass that is in a similar strained condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 470.—Various forms of ice ramparts (after\r\nBuckley).]\r\n\r\nThe original ice cover of the lake, which was formed at near-freezing\r\ntemperatures, has now received a number of inserted wedges of new ice\r\nat a time when its contracted volume has made this possible. If now\r\na “warm wave” succeeds to the “cold wave” in the air, the ice cover\r\nexpands at a rate corresponding to its rate of contraction, so that a\r\nstrong pressure is exerted against the shore (Fig. 469). Sliding up\r\nthe sloping surface of the cut and built terrace, the force of this\r\nshove may be deflected upward against the cliff, and if this is of\r\nloose materials, the effect may be to ram bowlders into the bank, to\r\npush up ramparts or ridges, to overturn trees, etc. (Fig. 470). In\r\nmarsh land the frozen surface layer may slide over its unfrozen base\r\nand be forced up into broken folds (lower diagram of Figs. 469 and 470).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 471.—Map of Lake Mendota at Madison, Wisconsin, showing the\r\nposition of the ridge which forms from ice expansion, and the ice\r\nramparts about the shores of the bays (based on Buckley’s map).]\r\n\r\nIn order that ice ramparts may be formed, it is necessary that\r\nthe winter climate of the district be severe and characterized by\r\nalternating cold and warm waves, involving considerable range of air\r\ntemperature below the freezing point. If the lake is small, the push of\r\nthe ice will be through so small a distance as not to yield appreciable\r\nramparts. If, on the other hand, the lake is too large, the ice cover\r\nis not rigid enough to transmit the push to the distant shore, but,\r\nlike a long beam employed in the same manner to transmit a compressive\r\nstress, it is bent out of a straight line and later broken. Thus in a\r\nbroad lake, with the coming of a “warm wave”, the ice cover opens in a\r\ncrack from shore to shore and finds relief from the stress by pushing\r\nup a ridge above the crack. On such lakes ice ramparts are found only\r\nabout the shores of bays whose expanse does not greatly exceed a mile\r\n(Fig. 471).\r\n\r\nWhen there is heavy snowfall, ice ramparts either do not form or are\r\nof smaller dimensions, probably in part because the ice is blanketed\r\nby the snow and so prevented from sudden elevation of temperature\r\nduring the “warm wave”, but even more because the ice cover is sensibly\r\nbowed down under its load and so rendered incompetent to transmit the\r\ndeveloped stresses to the shores.\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING REFERENCES FOR CHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n Lake extinction by peat growth:\r\n\r\n C.

Their summits need not be at great heights above the\r\nsea, but it is essential that they project above the average level\r\nof the surrounding country by at least a quarter of a mile. Lower\r\nelevations are described as hills. On the other hand, the elevation of\r\na plateau like the “High Plains” of the western United States may be as\r\nmuch as a mile, but the vast expanse of nearly level surface precludes\r\nthe use of the term “mountain.” The word is thus applied to a feature\r\nof the earth and not merely to an elevated tract.\r\n\r\nIn a collective sense, though more often in the plural form, the\r\nterm is properly applied to groups of similar features which have a\r\ncommon origin in local uplift of the land. The origin of mountains\r\nused in this sense of mountain complexes is thus connected with some\r\nessentially local uplift of the earth’s surface. This may take place\r\nby the processes of folding and superincumbent fault displacement,\r\nby volcanic extravasations or ejections, or by a deeper seated and\r\nessentially hydrostatic elevation of rock beds over molten rock\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nThe existing _forms_ of mountains, as we are to see, are largely shaped\r\nby the erosional processes which are set in operation by the uplift\r\nitself, though often completed long subsequent to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The festoons of mountain arcs.=—From our earliest studies of school\r\ngeographies, we have become familiar with the arrangement of the more\r\nimportant mountains in long chains or systems. Comparatively few\r\npersons have given any further attention to the arrangement of the\r\nchains, though over large areas of the earth’s surface the distribution\r\nof mountain ranges is deeply significant. The map of Asia in particular\r\npresents a series of great sweeping arcs or crescents which are grouped\r\nas though hung upon the map in festoons with knots or vertexes to\r\nseparate neighboring groups (Fig. 474, p. 438, and Fig. 472).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 472.—The great multiple mountain arc of Sewestan, British India\r\n(after de Saint Martin and Schrader).]\r\n\r\nThe significance of these mountain groupings in the evolution of the\r\nearth’s surface has been pointed out by the great Viennese geologist\r\nSuess, to whom we are indebted for focusing upon the plan of the\r\nearth an amount of attention which before had been largely given to\r\nthe preparation of hypothetical sections of strata which were largely\r\nburied from sight beneath the earth’s surface. Broadly speaking,\r\nthe mountain arcs may be said to be grouped about those shields of\r\nolder rock which geological studies have shown to be the oldest land\r\nmasses upon the globe. Within the northern hemisphere these original\r\ncontinents are represented by the areas of crystalline rock centered\r\nover Hudson Bay, the Baltic Sea, and an area in northeastern Siberia\r\nknown to geologists as Angara Land. In our study of the figure of\r\nthe earth (Chapter II) it was found that these shields represent the\r\ntruncated angles of the rounded tetrahedral form toward which the\r\nplanet is tending (Fig. 3, p. 12).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Theories of origin of the mountain arcs.=—The mountain arcs, when\r\nstudied in detail, are found to be composed of closely folded rock\r\nstrata, the flexures of which are generally so overturned that their\r\naxial planes dip toward the center of the arc (Fig. 473). It was the\r\nview of Suess that these arcs are to be explained by a pushing outward\r\nof the rock strata from the center of the arc toward its periphery,\r\nthus causing a wrinkling of the surface strata and an overriding of the\r\nsurrounding formations, which upon this hypothesis opposed a greater\r\nresistance to the sliding movement. The folding together of the strata\r\ndue to the sliding naturally involves a very considerable diminution\r\nof the surface area presented by the strata (Fig. 22, p. 42). In the\r\ncase of the Alpine chains it has been estimated that a flat land area,\r\nfour hundred to eight hundred miles across, has by the folding process\r\nbeen reduced to a width of only about one hundred miles, or from a\r\nfourth to an eighth of its former width.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 473.—_a_, diagram to illustrate the Suess’ theory of the origin\r\nof mountain arcs; _b_, the author’s modification of this view.]\r\n\r\nThe weakness of Professor Suess’ theory lies in the fact that such\r\ncompression as it implies is assumed to be due to an _outward_\r\nmovement of the relatively small area of the earth’s outer shell\r\nwhich is included _within_ the arc. It must be obvious that such a\r\nmovement, being from a center toward three sides at once, would for\r\nthis circumscribed area involve enormous proportionate reduction in\r\nsuperficial area of the strata and could only result in a hiatus near\r\nthe center of the arc. No such gap is to be found, and one would,\r\nmoreover, be difficult to account for upon any plausible hypothesis.\r\nOn the other hand, the general contraction of the planet as a whole,\r\ninvolving as it does reduction of surface over large areas, is a\r\nwell-recognized fact; and if it be true that the shields formed by the\r\nolder continents are less subject to contraction than the remaining\r\nportions of the surface, it is easy to understand why the earth’s outer\r\nskin should be wrinkled by _underfolding_ and thrusting about these\r\ncontinental margins. The contrast of this view with that of Professor\r\nSuess is expressed in the diagrams of Fig. 473.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 474.—Festoons of mountain arcs about the borders of the Pacific\r\nOcean—Pacific type of coast (based upon Suess).]\r\n\r\nWe may illustrate this conception by a stretched sheet of rubber cloth\r\nsuch as is in common use by dentists, upon which a thin layer of hot\r\nCanada balsam has been spread. This substance congeals upon cooling to\r\nnear-normal temperatures, and if a small local area of the balsam layer\r\nbe chilled and the tension upon the rubber then released, the viscous\r\nbalsam of the unchilled portion of the layer is thrown into wrinkles\r\nabout the cooled and more resistant areas. These more resistant\r\nportions of the stratum may thus represent the ancient continental\r\nshields of our planet.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Atlantic and Pacific coasts contrasted.=—In his studies of\r\nmountain arcs in their relation to the plan of the earth, Professor\r\nSuess has shown how the arrangements of the mountain chains about the\r\ntwo larger oceans represent two strongly contrasted types. Whereas\r\nabout the Pacific margin the mountain arcs are, as it were, strung in\r\nfestoons which trend parallel to and are convex toward the coast, or\r\nelse lie in fringing garlands of islands in the same attitude (Fig.\r\n474); the mountain chains about the Atlantic become sharply truncated\r\nas they reach the coast, and thus indicate that the basin of this ocean\r\nhas been produced by an inthrow or depression between great marginal\r\ndisplacements in some period subsequent to the formation of the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 475.—The interrupted system of the Armorican Mountains common to\r\nwestern Europe and eastern North America (after Arldt).]\r\n\r\nThus the mountain folds of the Appalachian system are in Newfoundland\r\ncut off abruptly at the coast line, and the same beds, similarly\r\ntruncated, are encountered again across the expanse of ocean in the\r\nfolds at the coast of western Europe (Fig. 475). In discontinuous\r\nremnants this ancient mountain chain may be traced in an east and\r\nwest direction across western and central Europe. We have thus here\r\nto do with a single mountain system which extends from central Europe\r\nto northern Alabama, out of which a great link has been taken by the\r\nsubsequent sinking in of the basin of the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 476.—Schematic representation of a “zone of diverse displacement”\r\nin the Great Basin of the western United States (after Powell).]\r\n\r\n=The block type of mountain.=—The inclusion of most elevations in\r\nmountain chains and arcs is one of the most obvious facts to any one\r\nwho has examined world atlases with this subject in mind. Such chains\r\nare almost invariably composed of folded rocks, thus indicating that\r\nerosion has removed great superincumbent masses of strata since the\r\ncrustal compression produced the folds at considerable depths below the\r\nthen surface.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, large elevated tracts upon the earth’s surface\r\nwhich are intersected by deep valleys, but where no arrangement of the\r\nelevated portions within chains or ranges is to be detected. In such\r\ncases the distribution of mountain and valley may bear a resemblance to\r\na mosaic of disturbed parts which stand at different levels (Fig. 476).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 477.—Section of an East African block mountain\r\n(after J. W. Gregory).]\r\n\r\nSuch block mountain districts are to be found in many parts of the\r\nearth’s surface, but notably within the Great Basin of the western\r\nUnited States, and in the land area which borders the Indian Ocean\r\nupon the west and northwest. In contrast with the mountain arcs, so\r\nstrikingly exemplified by the continent of Asia as a whole, its extreme\r\nsouthwestern portion is made up of an alternation of plateau and\r\nrift valley separated from each other by great displacements. Though\r\nmodified to some extent by erosion, the elevations seem generally to\r\nrepresent the displaced crust blocks which in mutual adjustments have\r\nbeen left at the highest levels (Fig. 477). The valley of the Jordan,\r\nwith the mountains of Lebanon rising above it, is near the northern\r\nextremity of this faulted mountain region (Fig. 434, p. 404), while\r\nthe Great Rift valley, crossing east Central Africa, and the many\r\nneighboring rifts to the east and west, are graven in lines so deep\r\nthat an observer upon a neighboring planet might perhaps detect them.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary in all cases to assume that the block mountains of\r\na faulted district represent the blocks which in the adjustments were\r\nleft the highest. Erosion in the course of time accomplishes marvels of\r\ntransformation, and it may result that heavy masses of more resistant\r\nrock eventually project the highest, even though they may represent the\r\ndownthrown blocks in the fault mosaic (Fig. 43, p. 60).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 478.—Tilted crust blocks in the Queantoweap\r\nvalley.]\r\n\r\nWhere in addition to undergoing changes of level the earth blocks\r\nhave been tilted, the features long since described from our western\r\ninterior basin as “Basin Range structure” are developed. Here the\r\nupper surface of the disturbed earth blocks betrays the evidence of a\r\ndefinite tilt in some one direction (Fig. 478, and Fig. 431, p. 402).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mountains of outflow or upheap.=—An important type of mountain,\r\ngenerally described as volcanic, may be due either to the outflow of\r\nlava at the earth’s surface, or to accumulations of separated fragments\r\nof lava, first thrown into the air, and then deposited by gravity or\r\nadmixed with water as volcanic mud. Such mountains, both before and\r\nafter modification by erosion, assume the strikingly characteristic\r\nforms which have been fully discussed in Chapters IX and X. The\r\ndominant types are the lava dome and the puy, the cinder cone, and\r\nthe more complex composite cone. Excepting only the surface produced\r\nby the few great fissure eruptions and the semivolcanic mesa type, the\r\nindividual mountains of volcanic origin develop features with notably\r\ncircular bases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 479.—Pen drawing of the laccolite of the Carriso Mountain by W.\r\nH. Holmes, which shows the jagged surface of the igneous rock core and\r\nthe sloping tables which still remain of the roof of sedimentary rocks\r\n(after Cross).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 480.—Map of laccolitic mountains. A portion of the Judith\r\nMountains, Montana. The intrusive igneous rock is shown in black (after\r\nWeed).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Domed mountains of uplift—laccolites.=—At a considerable number\r\nof widely separated localities upon the earth’s surface, mountainous\r\nregions are encountered, the central areas or cores of which are\r\ncomposed of intrusive igneous rock such as granite, and about this\r\ncore the sediments dip away in all directions as though they had once\r\nformed a continuous roof above it and had been forced into this dome by\r\nhydrostatic pressure of the once viscous material beneath (Fig. 152, p.\r\n143, and Figs. 479 and 480). Examples of such domed mountains of uplift\r\nwere first described by Gilbert from the Henry Mountains of Utah, but\r\ninstances are furnished by many elevated tracts, especially within\r\nthe western United States. Such mountains are known as _laccolites_,\r\nbut when one margin at least of the igneous core corresponds to a\r\ndisplacement, the mountain is described as a _bysmalite_ (Fig. 481).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 481.—Ideal sections of laccolite and bysmalite.]\r\n\r\nWhen subjected to long-continued erosion, the generally fissured\r\ngranitic core of the laccolite weathers in a wholly different manner\r\nfrom the bedded sediments which surround and still in part mount\r\nover it. The former usually presents a more or less jagged surface\r\nwhich contrasts sharply with the gently sloping tables of the latter\r\n(Fig. 479). About the high granite core of the mountain, the several\r\nstrata of the uptilted formations present each a steep slope toward\r\nthis higher land, and a gentler slope in the opposite direction.\r\nSuch unsymmetrical ridges which surround the mountain area are often\r\nreferred to as “hog backs” (plate 12 B). The arrangement of the\r\nstrata in the hog backs thus presents an overlapping series like the\r\nshingles upon a roof, except that the overlapping is here from the\r\nbottom instead of the top, and the exposed ends thus face toward the\r\ncrest. Unlike a shingle roof the hog backs do not shed the water which\r\ndescends to them from the higher levels, but, on the contrary, they\r\ncause it to flow in troughs parallel to the base of the slope except\r\nwhere outlets are found through them.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mountains carved from plateaus.=—In the mountain types thus far\r\ndiscussed, the local uplifting of the land has itself developed\r\nfeatures which in the aggregate may be referred to as mountains, even\r\nthough the characters of the original surface are soon destroyed by\r\nerosive processes of one sort or the other. Erosive processes are,\r\nhowever, quite competent to produce mountain forms from a featureless\r\nplateau, and particularly through the incision by streams of running\r\nwater, the best studied process of mountain sculpture (see Chapters\r\nXI-XIII). This process of throwing valleys about an elevated section\r\nof the earth’s surface, and so carving out mountains, is sometimes\r\ndescribed as _circumvallation_; and if the term “mountain” be applied\r\nin its ordinary sense to describe an individual feature, it is clear\r\nthat most mountains have been formed in this way.\r\n\r\nTo discuss the characteristic shapes of such mountains would be largely\r\nto review the contents of this book, and especially those portions\r\nwhich discuss the character profiles resulting from the action of each\r\nsculpturing or molding agent. The work of frost and other weathering\r\nagencies, of running water, of mountain and of continental glacier,\r\nwould all have to be considered in order to evolve the history of each\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\nIn addition to discovering the agents which were chiefly responsible\r\nfor the shaping of the mountain, we may, further, in many cases\r\ndetermine at what stage the work of one agent has been succeeded by\r\nthat of another, and at least at what stage of its complete cycle of\r\nactivity the latest agent is now at work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 482.—The gabled façade so largely developed in desert landscapes\r\nand sharply contrasted with the recurring curves in the landscapes of\r\nhumid districts (from a painting of the Grand Cañon of the Colorado by\r\nMoran).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The climatic conditions of the mountain sculpture.=—Since the\r\ndifferent geological agencies operate either in a different manner\r\nor with differences in vigor according to the varying climatic\r\nconditions, the mountains of arid regions may in most cases be readily\r\ndifferentiated from those of the more habitable humid sections of\r\ncountry. In broad lines these differences may be summed up in the\r\ngreater prevalence of the curving line within the landscapes of humid\r\ndistricts. This may be largely ascribed to the influence of the\r\nmat of vegetation, which protects the rock surface from more rapid\r\nmechanical degeneration, and arrests the sliding movements within\r\nthe already loosened rock débris. In place of the reversed curves\r\nof the lines of beauty, so generally observed in the landscapes of\r\nwell-watered regions, the desert lands present ever a repetition of the\r\nvertical cliff alternating with a sort of many gabled façade which is\r\noccasionally due to truncation of mountain spurs by the waves of former\r\nlakes, but far more often the outlines of débris cones built up beneath\r\neach prominent joint of the cliff walls (Fig. 482).\r\n\r\n\r\n=The effect of the resistant stratum.=—In a striking manner mountain\r\nlandscapes may disclose the influence of the diversified rock materials\r\nand of the rock structures as well. After prolonged erosion there\r\nis likely to be little correspondence between the positions of the\r\nanticlinal folds and the crests of the higher mountains. Such mountains\r\nare, in fact, much more likely to rise over synclines than upon the\r\nsite of anticlines. The traveler who enters the Alps by any of the\r\nseveral railways, or who journeys by steamer over the beautiful lake\r\nof Lucerne, has a most favorable opportunity to study the position\r\nof the rock folds in the mountain sections that are unrolled in\r\nsuccession before him. Rarely indeed will he find a definite anticline\r\nin correspondence with a mountain peak, for the layers which are most\r\nresistant have developed the peaks, and it is because the outer layers\r\nof the anticlines open by local tension (see Fig. 26, p. 45) that\r\nthey were first cut away by erosion, so that the hard layers within\r\nthe synclines are likely to constitute the peaks within the existing\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 483.—The Mythen, composed of Jurassic and Cretaceous sediments,\r\nand resting upon softer Tertiary formations. View from a balloon (after\r\na photograph by C. Schmidt).]\r\n\r\nWhen, as sometimes happens, an older and likewise more resistant bed\r\nhas been folded back upon younger and softer formations, an isolated\r\nremnant may be found “unrooted” to its base, upon which it appears as\r\nthough floating within a billowy sea of the softer formations (Fig.\r\n483).\r\n\r\n\r\n=The mark of the rift in the eroded mountains.=—Applying the term\r\n“mountain” in its collective sense for a circumscribed area of uplifted\r\ncrust, whether represented to-day by a folded or a faulted complex,\r\na lava mass, or a granite dome; the period of uplift has marked the\r\nbeginning of the activity of sculpturing agencies. By these the mass\r\nis pared down as it is shaped into a more or less intricate design of\r\ncomponent and essentially repeating units. In the vernacular the word\r\n“mountain” is applied to these units into which the larger mountain\r\nmass is subdivided.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 484.—The battlement type of erosion mountains. Die Drei Zinnen\r\n(Three Battlements) in the Dolomites (after Marr).]\r\n\r\nIt has been one of the main objects of this work to point out that the\r\npeculiar shapes of these elementary mountains are each characteristic\r\nof the erosive agents which produced them, and that each surface has\r\nmarks which may be recognized in those lines of profile which recur\r\nwithin the landscape—the character profiles. In the subdivision\r\nof the larger mass—the _genetical_ mountain—to form the numerous\r\nsmaller masses—the _erosional_ or _circumvallational_ mountains—there\r\nis disclosed a pattern of fractures which has guided the erosional\r\nagents in their incisional operations (see Chapter XVII). In high\r\naltitudes, where the action of frost is so potent in prying at the\r\nwider fractures, this subdivision of the mass may be revealed by the\r\nsculpturing of squared towers or battlements (Fig. 484).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 485.—Symmetrically formed low islands repeated in\r\nranks upon Temagami Lake, Ontario.]\r\n\r\nFor other examples in which the sculptured surface is largely the\r\nhandiwork of a single erosional agent, as over vast areas in the\r\nCanadian wilderness, the revelation of the fracture design is no less\r\napparent. Here a series of crystalline rocks underlie broad expanses\r\nof territory and are without noteworthy variations of hardness and\r\nalmost bare of surface débris. Sculptured beneath a mantling ice sheet,\r\nexcavation has naturally been concentrated above the more widely\r\ngaping fissures of the joint-fault system, doubtless already marked out\r\nin the river network which the glacier overrode. The result has been a\r\ndivision of the surface into a series of low, oval ridges or hummocks,\r\nwhich over vast areas are repeated with monotonous regularity. Wherever\r\nthe lower levels have been flooded, symmetrical low islands of nearly\r\nuniform elevation rise from the expanse of water and may be counted\r\nby thousands. Though the smaller islands have notably regular shore\r\nlines, the larger ones disclose their composition from smaller units\r\nby the breaking of their shores into similar bays spaced with regular\r\nintervals (Fig. 485, and Figs. 243 and 245, p. 229).\r\n\r\nThe ever repeating fracture design of the earth’s crust is not\r\nrestricted to the mountain masses which it has broken up, and the\r\nunity of which it has done so much to conceal. It extends far outside\r\nthe margin of these masses, and is in fact common to whole continents\r\nand perhaps even to the planet as a whole. The part played by this\r\ndesign of fractures in the control of the sculpture of landscapes it\r\nwould be hard to overestimate. Through its influence the striking\r\nfeatures molded by one agent have been merged in the contrasted shapes\r\ndeveloped by another. It is the great outline blender in the creation\r\nof nature’s masterpieces of form and color. Thus the lines of this\r\nmysterious fracture network, though stamped in indelible characters\r\nupon our landscapes, are generally lost in the ensemble effect and may\r\nlong remain undiscovered. Like a moss-grown inscription upon a slab of\r\nmarble, though veiled, it may yet be deciphered; and if the veil be\r\nwithdrawn, the runic characters are disclosed, and one of nature’s laws\r\nlies open before us.\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING REFERENCES FOR CHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n Mountain arcs or festoons:—\r\n\r\n ED.

To be a\r\ncompetent mineralogist, one must have a rather extended knowledge both\r\nof inorganic chemistry and of the science of crystallography, which,\r\nfascinating as it is to study, involves some technical knowledge of\r\nmathematics and much laboratory experience. Though necessary to any one\r\nwho contemplates making a career as a geologist, this special study is\r\nnot essential to a cultural course like the present one. The attempt\r\nwill here be made to bring together a body of fact, from the study of\r\nwhich the student may quickly learn to recognize the commonest minerals\r\nin their usual varieties. The tests he is to apply are mainly physical,\r\nand in place of an elaborate discussion of crystal symmetry, pictures\r\nonly can be supplied.\r\n\r\nTo the beginner the usual textbook of mineralogy is difficult to\r\nread intelligently, for the reason that for each mineral species it\r\nsets before him a catalogue of each physical property in its turn,\r\nwith little indication of those data which in the individual case\r\nhave special diagnostic value. None the less, however, the student\r\nis advised to consider the several properties of each mineral in a\r\ndefinite order, and the following may serve as well as any: crystal or\r\nother form, cleavage, fracture, luster, color, streak, transparency,\r\ntenacity, hardness, magnetism, and specific gravity. In endeavoring to\r\nconnect the specific values of these properties with individual mineral\r\nspecies, the chemical composition and the manner of occurrence are\r\nnot to be forgotten. It is well for the student to be supplied with a\r\nsmall pocket lens and with a pocket knife the blade of which has been\r\nmagnetized.\r\n\r\n=Crystal form.=—Some mineral species generally occur in more or less\r\ndefinite crystals—are bounded by definite plane surfaces developed\r\nwhen the mineral was formed; others in groups of interfering crystals\r\nor aggregates, in which case the mineral is said to be crystalline;\r\nwhile still others are rarely found crystallized at all. Thus in\r\na given case crystal form may, or may not, be important for the\r\ndiagnosis of the substance. If a mineral species is usually to be\r\nfound in crystals, the student should be aware of the fact, and if\r\npossible should have a mental picture of the common crystal shape or\r\nshapes. Without an extended knowledge of crystallography, this must be\r\nsupplied him by drawings. Since crystals of most species are apt to be\r\ndistorted, owing to the fact that some planes within the same group\r\nappear upon the crystal with a larger development than others, it is\r\nconvenient to remember that markings, such as lines or etchings upon\r\nthe crystal faces, are the same throughout the same group of planes,\r\nand in the text figures such groups of planes are indicated by the use\r\nof a common letter. For crystalline aggregates such terms as fibrous,\r\nradiating, massive, or granular have their usual meanings.\r\n\r\n=Cleavage.=—It is characteristic of most crystals that they break\r\nor _cleave_ along certain directions so as to leave plane or nearly\r\nplane surfaces, and the luster of the cleaved surface measures the\r\nperfection of the cleavage property. It is important always to note\r\nhow many such directions of cleavage are present, and, roughly at\r\nleast, at what angles they intersect—whether they are perpendicular\r\nto each other or inclined at some other angle. Further, it should be\r\nnoted whether a given cleavage is _perfect_, that is, easy, which will\r\nbe indicated by the thinness of the plates which can be secured. An\r\nextremely perfect cleavage is possessed by the mineral mica, whose\r\nplates are thinner than the thinnest paper. In the case of imperfect or\r\ninterrupted cleavage, the fracture surfaces are not plane throughout,\r\nbut interrupted, the surface “jumping” from one plane to a neighboring\r\nparallel one. It is especially important to note whether, in the case\r\nof several cleavages possessed by a crystal, all have the same degree\r\nof perfection, or whether they exhibit differences.\r\n\r\n=Fracture.=—In minerals with poorly developed cleavage, the fracture\r\nsurface is described as _fracture_. Fracture is thus perfect in\r\nproportion as cleavage is imperfect. The fracture is described as\r\nconchoidal when it shows waving spherical surfaces like broken glass.\r\nFor fine aggregates the fracture is described as even, uneven, earthy,\r\netc., names which are generally intelligible.\r\n\r\n=Luster.=—This term is applied especially to the manner in which light\r\nis reflected from mineral surfaces. The most important distinction is\r\nmade between those minerals which have a _metallic_ luster and those\r\nwhich have not, the former being always opaque. Other characteristic\r\nlusters are adamantine (like oiled glass), vitreous (glassy), resinous,\r\nwaxy, etc.\r\n\r\n=Color.=—For minerals which possess metallic luster the color is\r\nalways practically the same, and hence it becomes a valuable diagnostic\r\nproperty. Of minerals which have nonmetallic luster, the color may be\r\nalways the same and hence characteristic, but in the case of many\r\nminerals it ranges between wide limits and sometimes runs almost the\r\nentire gamut of hues, yet without appreciable changes in the chemical\r\ncomposition of the mineral.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Streak.=—This term is applied to the color of the mineral powder, and\r\nis usually fairly constant, even when the surface color of different\r\nspecimens may vary within wide limits. In the case of fairly soft\r\nminerals the streak is best examined by making a mark on a piece of\r\nunglazed porcelain (streak stone).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Transparency= (=diaphaneity=).—The terms “transparent”,\r\n“translucent”, “subtranslucent”, and “opaque” are used to describe\r\ndecreasing grades of permeability by light rays. Through transparent\r\nbodies print may be read, while translucent bodies allow the light to\r\nbe transmitted in considerable quantity through them, though without\r\nrendering the image of objects.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tenacity.=—This comprehensive term includes such properties as\r\nbrittleness, flexibility, elasticity, malleability, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hardness.=—Quite erroneous notions are held concerning the meaning\r\nof this very common word, which properly implies a resistance offered\r\nto abrasion. It is one of the most valuable properties for the quick\r\ndetermination of minerals, since minerals range from diamond upon the\r\none hand—the hardest of substances—to talc and graphite, which are\r\nso soft as to be deeply scratched by the thumb nail. For practical\r\npurposes it is sufficient to make use of a rough scale of hardness made\r\nup from common or well-known minerals. If we exclude the gem minerals,\r\nthis scale need include but seven numbers, which are: talc, 1; gypsum,\r\n2; calcite, 3; fluor spar, 4; apatite, 5; feldspar, 6; and quartz, 7.\r\nA given mineral is softer than a mineral in the scale when it can be\r\nvisibly scratched by a scale mineral, but will not leave a scratch when\r\nthe conditions are reversed. If each will scratch the other with equal\r\nreadiness, the two minerals have the same hardness.\r\n\r\nSince it may often be desirable to test mineral hardness when no scale\r\nis at hand, the following substitutes may be made use of: 1, greasy\r\nfeel and easily scratched by the thumb nail; 2, takes a scratch from\r\nthe thumb nail, but much less readily; 3, scratched by a copper coin\r\nand very easily by a pocket knife; 4, scratched without difficulty by\r\na knife; 5, scratched with difficulty by a knife, but easily by window\r\nglass; 6, scratched by window glass; 7, scratches window glass with\r\nreadiness, but a grain of sand may be substituted to represent quartz\r\nin the scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Magnetism.=—Though nearly all minerals which contain important\r\nquantities of the elements iron, cobalt, or nickel may be attracted to\r\na strong electromagnet, there are but two common minerals, and these\r\nof widely different appearance, whose powder is lifted by a common\r\nmagnet. Others are, however, lifted after strong heating in the air\r\n(_ignition_), and this is a valuable test.\r\n\r\n=Specific gravity.=—Rough tests of relative weight, or specific\r\ngravity, may be made by lifting fair-sized specimens in the hand.\r\nBetter determinations require the use of a spring balance.\r\n\r\n=Treatment with acid.=—The carbonate minerals react with warm and\r\ndilute mineral acid so as to give a boiling effect (effervescence),\r\nsince carbonic acid gas escapes into the air in the process.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPERTIES OF THE COMMON MINERALS\r\n\r\nThe more important common minerals fall into two classes according as\r\nthey have large economic importance as ores, or enter in an important\r\nway into the composition of rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The Minerals of Economic Importance\r\n\r\n=Hematite.=—The sesquioxide of iron, Fe_{2}O_{3}, and by far the most\r\nimportant ore of iron. Rarely in good crystals, but sometimes in thin\r\nopaque scales bearing some resemblance to mica and known as micaceous\r\nor specular iron ore. At other times in nodules built up from radial\r\nneedles (needle ore); in hard masses mixed with fine quartz grains\r\n(hard hematite); or in soft reddish brown earth (soft hematite).\r\nColor, black to cherry red. The powdered mineral always cherry red or\r\nreddish brown, and easily lifted by the magnet after ignition. Hardness\r\n5.5-6.5; specific gravity 5.\r\n\r\n=Magnetite.=—The magnetic oxide of iron, Fe_{3}O_{4}, often in\r\ncrystals like Fig. 486, ^{1-2}. Black and opaque with a metallic\r\nluster. Streak black. Lifted by a magnet and sometimes itself capable\r\nof lifting filings of soft iron (lodestone). Hardness 5.5-6.5. Specific\r\ngravity 5.\r\n\r\n=Limonite.=—The most abundant and most valuable of the hydrated iron\r\nores, 2 Fe_{2}O_{3}. 3 H_{2}O. Chemical composition the same as iron\r\nrust, with which in the earthy form it is identical. Never in crystals,\r\nbut often in mammillary or rounded pendant forms resembling icicles,\r\nor sometimes clusters of grapes. Its yellow (rust) streak is its best\r\ndiagnostic property. Ignited it gives off water and becomes magnetic.\r\nThe streak and its notably lower specific gravity distinguish it from\r\ncertain forms of hematite which it outwardly resembles. Hardness 5-5.5.\r\nSpecific gravity 3.6-4.\r\n\r\n=Pyrite, iron pyrites, or “fool’s gold.”=—The sulphide of iron,\r\nFeS_{2}. The most widely distributed sulphide mineral and now a chief\r\nsource of the great chemical reagent, sulphuric acid or vitriol.\r\nOften, but not always, in crystals (Fig. 486, ^{3-5}) which have\r\npeculiar striæ upon their faces. At other times the mineral is found\r\nmassive or in radiated needles. Bright metallic luster with the color\r\nof new brass, though often tarnished or altered upon the surface to\r\nlimonite. Hard and brittle, and so distinguished from gold, which is\r\nsoft and malleable and of the color of the paler old brass (which\r\ncontained a larger percentage of zinc). Gold is, further, about four\r\ntimes as heavy as pyrite. Hardness 6-6.5. Specific gravity 5.\r\n\r\n=Chalcopyrite, copper pyrites.=—A mixed sulphide of copper and iron.\r\nIf in crystals, like Fig. 486, ^6; otherwise massive or compact.\r\nLuster metallic. Color orange-yellow, often with local blue and green\r\niridescence like a pigeon’s throat. Distinguished from pyrite by the\r\ndeeper color and lower hardness, and from gold, particularly, by its\r\nbrittleness and lower specific gravity. Hardness 3.5-4. Specific\r\ngravity 4.\r\n\r\n=Galenite, galena.=—Sulphide of lead, PbS. The chief ore of lead, and,\r\nfrom admixture of a silver mineral, of silver as well. Usually found in\r\ncrystals (Fig. 486, ^7). Always cleaves into blocks bounded by six very\r\nperfect rectangular faces which, when freshly broken, show a bright\r\nsilvery luster and quickly tarnish to a peculiarly “leaden” surface.\r\nVery heavy. Color and streak lead-gray. Hardness 2.5. Specific gravity\r\n7.5.\r\n\r\n=Sphalerite, zinc blende.=—Sulphide of zinc, ZnS, usually with\r\nconsiderable admixture of sulphide of iron. The great ore of zinc.\r\nNot infrequently in crystals (Fig. 486, ^{8-9}), but more often in\r\ncleavable crystalline aggregates. The cleavage in fine aggregates is\r\nsometimes difficult to make out, but in coarse-grained masses it is\r\nseen to be equally and highly perfect in six different directions,\r\nso that a symmetrical twelve-faced form may sometimes be broken out\r\n(dodecahedron). Luster like that of rosin (rosin jack), though when\r\nwith large iron admixture the color may approach black (black jack).\r\nThe lighter colored varieties are translucent. Hardness 3.5-4. Specific\r\ngravity 4.\r\n\r\n=Malachite.=—Hydrated (basic) copper carbonate. The green copper ore\r\nand the common surface alteration product of other copper minerals.\r\nUsually has a microscopic structure made up of fine needle-like\r\ncrystals, but generally massive in various imitative shapes not unlike\r\nthose of the iron ores. Sometimes earthy. Its color is bright green,\r\nand it is usually found in association with other characteristic copper\r\nores, such as chalcopyrite and azurite. When relatively pure and in\r\nlarge masses, it is a beautiful ornamental stone. Effervesces with\r\nacid. Hardness 3.5-4. Specific gravity 4.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 486.—Forms of Crystals: 1-2, magnetite; 3-5,\r\npyrite; 6, chalcopyrite; 7, galenite; 8-9, sphalerite; 10-13, calcite.]\r\n\r\n=Azurite.=—Hydrated (basic) copper carbonate, less hydrated than\r\nmalachite, and known as the blue carbonate of copper. Generally in very\r\nminute and quite complex crystals, but also in imitative shapes similar\r\nto those of malachite, and at other times earthy. Slightly lighter in\r\nweight than malachite, from which it is easily distinguished, as from\r\nmost other minerals, by its bright azure blue color and its somewhat\r\nlighter blue streak. Effervesces with nitric acid. Hardness 3.5-4.\r\nSpecific gravity 3.7-3.8.\r\n\r\n=Calcite.=—Calcium carbonate, CaCO_{3}. Almost always in crystals\r\n(Fig. 486, ^{10-13}), or in confused crystal aggregates, though\r\nrarely fibrous or dull and earthy. Some of the forms of the crystals\r\nare described as “dog-tooth spar”, others as “nail-head spar”, while\r\nstill others are modified hexagonal prisms. There is a beautifully\r\nperfect cleavage of the mineral along three directions which make\r\nangles of about 105° with each other, so that under the hammer the\r\nsubstance breaks into blocks which are shaped like the crystal of Fig.\r\n486, ^{10}. Usually white or gray, but occasionally faintly tinted.\r\nStreak white. Effervesces with cold and dilute mineral acids. An\r\nassociate of many ores and the chief mineral of limestone. A similar\r\nmineral—dolomite—contains in addition magnesium carbonate, has\r\nsimpler crystals (like the drawing of Fig. 486, ^{10}, but often with\r\nrounded faces), and effervesces only when the acid is warmed. Hardness\r\n3. Specific gravity 2.7.\r\n\r\n=Gypsum.=—Hydrated calcium sulphate, CaSO_{4}.2 H_{2}O, and the\r\nsource of plaster of Paris. Often in simple crystals (Fig. 487, ^1)\r\nor else “swallow tail”, like Fig. 487, ^2; in which case the mineral\r\nis generally either transparent or translucent and is described as\r\nselenite. Such crystals show a cleavage approaching in perfection that\r\nof the micas, but, unlike the mica laminæ, those produced by cleavage\r\nin gypsum though flexible are not elastic. There are also fibrous forms\r\nof gypsum (satin spar), a fine-grained form (alabaster), and the impure\r\nearthy form (rock gypsum). Very soft, light in weight, and difficultly\r\nfusible. Color usually white, gray, or pale yellow. Hardness 2.\r\nSpecific gravity 2.3.\r\n\r\n=Copper glance.=—A sulphide of copper, Cu_{2}S. Not usually well\r\ncrystallized, but generally massive and associated or variously admixed\r\nwith other copper ores such as chalcopyrite, malachite, etc. Fracture\r\nconchoidal, luster metallic, color and streak blackish lead-gray,\r\nthough often tarnished blue or green from surface alterations to the\r\ncopper carbonates. Softer and heavier than chalcopyrite. Blowpipe or\r\nchemical tests are necessary for its identification. Hardness 2.5-3.\r\nSpecific gravity 5.5-5.8.\r\n\r\n=Cerussite.=—The white or carbonate lead ore, PbCO_{3}, and an\r\nimportant ore of silver as well. Often in crystals of considerable\r\ncomplexity, though Fig. 487, ^{3-4}, shows some common shapes. Often\r\ngranular, massive, or earthy (gray carbonate ore). Very brittle and\r\nwith conchoidal fracture. The luster is adamantine or like that of\r\noiled glass. Color generally white or gray. Very heavy, the heaviest\r\nof light colored and nonmetallic minerals. Dissolves in nitric acid\r\nwith effervescence. Hardness 3-3.5. Specific gravity 6.5.\r\n\r\n=Siderite.=—The carbonate or “spathic” ore of iron, FeCO_{3}. Either\r\nin crystals resembling in form Fig. 486, ^{10}, but with rounded faces,\r\nor cleavable massive to finely granular and earthy. The crystalline\r\nvarieties cleave easily into smaller blocks of the same form as those\r\nof calcite. Color usually gray or brown and streak white. On strongly\r\nigniting, the white powder becomes black and magnetic. Lighter in both\r\ncolor and weight than the other iron ores, and unlike them siderite\r\neffervesces with acid. Distinguished from calcite by its higher\r\nspecific gravity and its change upon being ignited. Hardness 3.5-4.\r\nSpecific gravity 3.9.\r\n\r\n=Smithsonite.=—Carbonate of zinc, ZnCO_{3}, and an important ore of\r\nthat metal. Seldom found in crystals except as a replacement of calcite\r\ncrystals, in which case it shows the forms characteristic of the latter\r\nmineral. Usually kidney-shaped, stalactitic, or else in incrustations\r\nupon other minerals. Sometimes granular or earthy. Brittle. Luster\r\nvitreous, color white or greenish gray, though often stained yellow\r\nwith iron rust. Streak white except when the mineral is stained with\r\niron. Effervesces with warm acid. Hardness 5. Specific gravity 4.4.\r\n\r\n=Pyrolusite.=—Black oxide of manganese, MnO_{2}, though generally\r\nimpure from admixture with other manganese oxides. Usually in intricate\r\naggregates which may be columnar, fibrous, mammillary, earthy, etc.\r\nOpaque, with color and streak both black. Soft and easily soils\r\nthe fingers. With hydrochloric acid gives off the choking fumes of\r\nchlorine. Hardness 2-2.5. Specific gravity 4.8.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The Minerals important as Rock Makers\r\n\r\nThese minerals are in most cases complex silicates of one or more of\r\na certain number of metals such as aluminium, calcium, magnesium,\r\niron, sodium, potassium, or hydroxyl (OH). For their identification an\r\nexamination of the physical properties is usually sufficient, whereas\r\nof the typical ore minerals already considered, additional chemical\r\ntests may be necessary.\r\n\r\n=Feldspars.=—A group of similar alumino-silicates of potassium,\r\nsodium, and calcium. The most important of all rock-making minerals.\r\nAlthough with wide variation in chemical composition, the feldspars are\r\nyet broadly divided into two classes; the one striated, and the other\r\nan unstriated potash or orthoclase variety. The pocket lens is usually\r\nnecessary in order to make out the striations upon the crystal or\r\ncleavage surfaces. When formed in veins, feldspar appears in crystals\r\n(Fig. 487, ^{5-6}), but as a rock constituent the mutual interference\r\nof crystals prevents the development of bounding faces. Two cleavage\r\ndirections, nearly or quite perpendicular to each other, are notably\r\ndifferent in their perfection. Hard enough to scratch glass, but easily\r\nscratched by sand. Color pink (usually orthoclase or microline), white\r\n(often albite) to gray. Sometimes with beautiful “pigeon’s throat”\r\neffect of iridescence (labradorite). Low specific gravity. Hardness 6.\r\nSpecific gravity 2.5-2.8.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 487.—Forms of Crystals: 1-2, gypsum; 3-4, cerussite; 5-6,\r\nfeldspar; 7, quartz; 8, pyroxene (cross section); 9, hornblende\r\n(cross section); 10, garnet; 11, nephelite; 12-14, staurolite; 15-16,\r\ntourmaline (cross sections); 17, olivine.]\r\n\r\n=Quartz.=—Oxide of silicon or silica, SiO_{2}. Both an important vein\r\nmineral associated with the ores and a rock maker. In the former case\r\nparticularly, often in crystals of notably simple forms (Fig. 487, ^7).\r\nFew minerals which are not gems are so hard. Remarkable freedom from\r\ncleavage so that the mineral breaks much like window glass—conchoidal\r\nfracture. Wide range in both transparency and color. Transparent and\r\ncolorless crystalline variety (rock crystal), brown translucent (smoky\r\nquartz), turbid white (milky quartz), and various colored varieties\r\n(carnelian, jasper, jet, etc.). Insoluble in acids and infusible.\r\nHardness 7. Specific gravity 2.6.\r\n\r\n=Micas.=—Like the feldspars a group of complex silicates, but here\r\nchiefly of potassium, magnesium, iron, and hydroxyl. Abundant as rock\r\nmakers, the micas are all characterized by the thinnest and toughest of\r\nelastic cleavage plates, such as are generally known as isinglass. When\r\na needle is driven sharply through a thin scale of mica, a six-rayed\r\npuncture star forms about the needle point. The darker common variety\r\nof mica is rich in iron and magnesium and is called biotite, and the\r\nlighter colored alkaline variety, muscovite. Hardness 2.5-3.1. Specific\r\ngravity 2.7-3.1.\r\n\r\n=Chlorite.=—Generally an intricate mixture of more or less similar\r\nmicroscopic crystals having varying and rather complex chemical\r\ncompositions and related to the micas, but all characterized by\r\na peculiar leaf green color. These minerals are a common product\r\nof hydration weathering in rocks which are rich in magnesium and\r\niron—especially those that contain biotite, pyroxene, or hornblende\r\n(see below). Hardness 1-2.5. Specific gravity 2.5-3.\r\n\r\n=Pyroxenes.=—An important group of related rock-making minerals all\r\nof which are silicates of the bases magnesium, calcium, aluminium,\r\niron, and manganese. Quite generally developed either in columnar or\r\nneedle-like crystals which are uniformly shaped in cross section like\r\nFig. 487, ^8. Two rather imperfect cleavages are directed parallel\r\nto the longer axis of the crystal and nearly at right angles to each\r\nother. The colors of all but the lime varieties are dark and generally\r\ngreen, dark brown, bronze, or black. The lime varieties are white,\r\ngray, or pale green. A dark colored and common iron variety is known as\r\naugite. Streak generally either white or lightly tinted. Hardness 5-6.\r\nSpecific gravity 3.2-3.6.\r\n\r\n=Amphiboles.=—A group of minerals of the same chemical composition\r\nas the pyroxenes, with which also in most physical properties they\r\nagree. The principal distinction is found in the shape of the cross\r\nsection and in the cleavage (Fig. 487, ^9). Whereas the cross sections\r\nof pyroxenes are generally eight sided, those of the amphiboles have\r\nsix sides, and whereas the cleavage directions of pyroxenes are nearly\r\nat right angles to each other (87°), the similar but much more perfect\r\ncleavage directions of the amphiboles are inclined at an obtuse angle\r\n(124½°). Owing to the obliquity of the amphibole cleavage, fractured\r\nsurfaces of the mineral appear splintery, which is not in the same\r\nmeasure true of the pyroxenes. A fibrous variety of amphibole, and\r\noccasionally other varieties of the mineral, is a not uncommon product\r\nof weathering of pyroxenes. Other physical properties of the amphiboles\r\nare in the main almost identical with those of the pyroxenes.\r\n\r\n=Garnet.=—Complex alumino-silicates or ferro-silicates of calcium,\r\nmagnesium, iron, or manganese, or several of these combined. Nearly\r\nalways in crystals, and usually found in mica schist (see below).\r\nThe crystals usually have twelve similar faces, each a lozenge\r\n(dodecahedron), or else twenty-four similar faces, or the two forms\r\ncombined (Fig. 487, ^{10}). Brittle. From any but the gem minerals garnet\r\nis easily distinguished by its hardness, which in different varieties\r\nranges from somewhat below to somewhat above that of quartz. The luster\r\nis vitreous, and the color runs the gamut of reds, browns, and greens,\r\nbut with the common hue dark red to black. Streak white. Hardness\r\n6.5-7.5. Specific gravity 3.1-4.3.\r\n\r\n=Nephelite= (=nephelene=).—An alumino-silicate of sodium and\r\npotassium. In certain special provinces this mineral is developed in\r\nabundance as an essential constituent of igneous rocks, but elsewhere\r\npractically unknown. The rare crystals are hexagonal prisms (Fig.\r\n487, ^{11}), but the mineral is most easily determined by its general\r\nresemblance to feldspar, but with the differences of cleavage, luster,\r\nand reaction with acid. Whereas the feldspars have two cleavages,\r\neither nearly or quite perpendicular to each other and of different\r\ndegrees of perfection, nephelite has three equal cleavages inclined\r\n60° and 120° to each other and of less perfection than either feldspar\r\ncleavage. The luster of nephelite is perhaps the best clew to its\r\nidentity, since this is greasy and simulated by but few minerals.\r\nThe fine powder of the mineral treated for some time with strong\r\nhydrochloric acid forms a perfect jelly of silicic acid, whereas\r\nthe feldspars do not. Though itself gray or white and unobtrusive,\r\nnephelite is usually associated with brightly colored minerals, which\r\nare often the first clew to its presence in a rock. Hardness 5.5-6.\r\nSpecific gravity 2.5-2.6.\r\n\r\n=Talc= (=soapstone=).—A silicate of magnesium and hydroxyl which is\r\nan important alteration product through weathering of certain pyroxene\r\nrocks especially. Usually a foliated mass, this product is occasionally\r\nfibrous or even granular. Talc is one of the softest of minerals,\r\nhaving a greasy feel and being easily scratched with the thumb nail.\r\nThe luster of the foliated varieties is apt to be pearly, and the\r\ncolor apple-green to white, though sometimes stained brown from oxide\r\nof iron. The streak of the mineral is white except when stained by\r\niron. Although the rocks which are composed mainly of talc (soapstone)\r\nare exceedingly soft, they are very tough and remarkably resistant.\r\nHardness 1-1.5. Specific gravity 2.7-2.8.\r\n\r\n=Serpentine.=—Like talc, serpentine is a silicate of magnesium and\r\nhydroxyl, and an important product of the breaking down of magnesium\r\nminerals in the process of weathering. The mineral is usually found\r\nas a fine web of microscopic needle-like fibers, and is best roughly\r\ndiagnosed by its color and its associated minerals. Like talc it is\r\nusually developed within those igneous rocks from which feldspar is\r\nlacking, but where either pyroxene or olivine is found in abundance or\r\nwas previous to alteration. The characteristic color of serpentine is\r\nleek-green. The rock largely composed of serpentine is called by the\r\nsame name, and being exceedingly tough and unchanging is, in spite of\r\nits softness, a valuable building and ornamental stone. A red magnesium\r\ngarnet is apt to be associated with such serpentine masses. Hardness\r\n2.5-4, because of impurities. Specific gravity 2.5-2.6.\r\n\r\n=Staurolite.=—A silicate of aluminium, iron, and hydroxyl. Found\r\nin metamorphic rocks usually in association with garnet. Always in\r\ncrystals bounded by simple forms generally crossed, as shown in Fig.\r\n487, ^{12-14}. The color is dark reddish brown, and the streak is\r\ncolorless to grayish. The hardness is exceptional and higher than that\r\nof quartz. Hardness 7-7.5. Specific gravity 3.6-3.7.\r\n\r\n=Tourmaline.=—An exceptionally complex silicate of boron and aluminium\r\nas well as iron, magnesium, and the alkalies. Found in metamorphic\r\nrocks and always crystallized. The crystals are columns or needles\r\nwhose cross section is the best guide to their identity, since this\r\nis a modified triangle unlike that of any other mineral (Fig. 487,\r\n^{15-16}). Additional diagnostic properties are the characteristic\r\nstriations which run lengthwise of the crystals upon prism faces, and\r\nthe lack of any cleavage (difference from hornblende). The hardness is\r\nalso a valuable property, since this is greater than that of quartz.\r\nThe mineral is brittle and the fracture subconchoidal. The range in\r\ncolor is as great as, or greater than, that of garnet, though the\r\ncommon forms are jet black. Streak uncolored. Hardness 7-7.5. Specific\r\ngravity 3-3.2.\r\n\r\n=Olivine.=—A silicate of magnesium and iron and a rock-making mineral\r\nfound only in those igneous rocks which have little or no feldspar. It\r\neasily suffers alteration by weathering and passes into serpentine,\r\nand in fact is seldom found except when at least partially altered to\r\nthe fibrous webs of that mineral. The form of the unaltered crystals\r\nwithin the rocks is shown in Fig. 487, ^{17}, and, cut in sections, the\r\nmineral appears in more or less elongated hexagons. The hardness of\r\nthe unaltered mineral is about that of quartz. It has rather imperfect\r\ncleavages in two rectangular directions, and is usually translucent,\r\nwith a vitreous luster and a color which is olive-green when not\r\nstained brown by oxide of iron. Streak uncolored. Hardness 6.5-7.\r\nSpecific gravity 3.2-3.3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B\r\n\r\nSHORT DESCRIPTIONS OF SOME COMMON ROCKS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Chapter IV the classification and the structure of rocks have been\r\nbriefly discussed. Below are added brief descriptions of the more\r\nimportant common rocks. For rocks as for minerals it is, however,\r\nessential that a collection of well-chosen specimens be studied for\r\npurposes of comparison. A small pocket lens is a valuable aid in making\r\nout the component minerals and the textures of the finer grained rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Intrusive Rocks\r\n\r\n=Granite.=—Of granitic texture, though sometimes porphyritic as well.\r\nThe most abundant mineral constituent is a pink or white feldspar,\r\nusually without visible striations, with which there is usually in\r\nsubordinate quantity a white striated feldspar. Next in importance to\r\nthe feldspar is quartz, which because of its lack of cleavage shows a\r\npeculiar gray surface resembling wet sugar. In addition to feldspar\r\nand quartz there is generally, though not universally, a dark colored\r\nmineral, either mica or hornblende. The mica is usually biotite, though\r\noften associated with muscovite.\r\n\r\n=Syenite.=—Like granite, but without quartz, with more striated\r\nfeldspar, and generally also the rock has a darker average tint.\r\nWhile biotite is the commonest dark colored constituent of granite,\r\nhornblende is more apt to take its place in syenite. Less common than\r\ngranite, to which it is closely related in origin and in composition.\r\n\r\n=Gabbro.=—A dark colored rock of granitic texture composed of striated\r\nfeldspar with broad cleavage surfaces and usually an abundance of\r\npyroxene. In contrast to the feldspars of granite, those of gabbroes\r\nare often dull and colored grayish yellow or greenish. The pyroxene\r\nis often in part changed to fibrous amphibole. Magnetite may be an\r\nabundant accessory mineral.\r\n\r\n=Diabase.=—In color dark like gabbro, and of similar constitution. In\r\ndiabase, however, the feldspar crystals, instead of being broad and of\r\nirregularly interrupted outline, are relatively long (“lath-shaped”),\r\nand the pyroxene acts as a filler of the residual space between them.\r\n\r\n=Peridotite.=—A heavy and dark colored rock of granitic texture which\r\nis nearly or quite devoid of feldspar but contains olivine. When\r\naltered, as it generally is, it is largely a mass of serpentine, talc,\r\nand chlorite, surrounding cores, it may be, of still unaltered pyroxene\r\nand olivine. Magnetite is an abundant constituent, and a red garnet is\r\napt to be present.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Extrusive Rocks\r\n\r\n=Obsidian.=—A rock glass rich in silica. It is usually black and\r\nbreaks with a perfect conchoidal fracture. It often passes over through\r\ninsensible gradations into pumice, which differs only in its vesicular\r\nstructure. As regards chemical composition, obsidian and pumice are not\r\nnotably different from rhyolite (below).\r\n\r\n=Rhyolite.=—A light colored rock of porphyritic texture, often also\r\nwith fluxion or spherulitic textures, or both combined. The porphyritic\r\nappearance is given the rock by large crystals of a glassy, unstriated\r\nfeldspar and crystals of quartz. Rhyolite is a very siliceous lava\r\ncontaining rather more silica than granite, to which of the intrusive\r\nrocks it is most closely related, and from which it differs in its\r\ntexture and in the manner of its occurrence in nature. Whereas\r\ngranite is found in great batholites, laccolites, and bysmalites,\r\nand consolidated in most cases beneath the earth’s surface, rhyolite\r\ngenerally occurs in sheets, flows, or dikes, and consolidated either\r\nabove or in fissures near to the surface.\r\n\r\n=Trachyte.=—Similar to rhyolite, but usually with a peculiar gray\r\naspect from the greater abundance of feldspar crystals. The rock\r\nis less siliceous than rhyolite, contains no quartz crystals, and\r\napproaches a feldspar in its average composition.\r\n\r\n=Andesite.=—Similar to rhyolite in appearance and in origin, but more\r\nbasic and correspondingly dark in color. The porphyritic crystals\r\nare of lath-shaped, striated feldspar, with which are associated\r\ncrystals of either biotite or hornblende or both. A fluxion texture is\r\nparticularly characteristic of this type of extrusive rock.\r\n\r\n=Basalt.=—A dark colored or black basic rock of porphyritic texture\r\nwhich differs but little from diabase. It may show under the lens fine\r\nlath-shaped crystals of striated feldspar associated with crystals\r\nof augite, but more frequently the rock is dense and without visible\r\nmineral constituents. It is particularly likely to occur divided up\r\ninto columns six inches to a foot in diameter and known as basaltic\r\ncolumns. Especially fine examples are known from the Giant’s Causeway\r\nand other localities in the western British Isles.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Sedimentary Rocks of Mechanical Origin\r\n\r\n=Conglomerate= (“=pudding stone=”).—A rock made up from pebbles which\r\nare cemented together with sand and finer materials. The pebbles are\r\nusually worn by work of the waves upon a shore, and may vary in size\r\nfrom a pea to large bowlders. They may consist of almost any hard\r\nmineral or rock, though the sand about them is largely quartz.\r\n\r\n=Sandstone.=—A rock composed of sand cemented together either by\r\ncalcareous, siliceous, or ferruginous materials. Sandstones are\r\ndescribed as friable when their surface grains are easily rubbed off,\r\nor as compact when they are more firmly cemented. Sandstones are often\r\ndistinctly banded and are sometimes variously stained with oxide of\r\niron. Those sandstones which have been formed upon a seacoast are known\r\nas marine sandstones, while those derived from accumulations collected\r\nby the wind in deserts are distinguished as continental deposits.\r\nSandstones form much thicker formations than conglomerates, the latter\r\nusually constituting a basal layer only of the sandstone formation\r\n(basal conglomerate).\r\n\r\n=Shale.=—A consolidated mud stone which is probably the most abundant\r\nrock formation. In large part clay admixed in varying proportions with\r\nextremely fine sandy grains.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Sedimentary Rocks of Chemical Precipitation\r\n\r\n=Calcareous tufa= (=travertine=).—Not to be confused with tuff,\r\nwhich is a fragmental extrusive or volcanic rock. Calcareous tufa is\r\nformed when waters which contain carbonic acid gas and lime carbonate\r\nin solution, give off the gas and with it the power to hold the lime\r\nin solution. Such a liberation of the gas may occur when the stream\r\nis dashed into spray above a cascade, and the lime is then deposited\r\nabout the site of the falls. Travertine is generally porous and formed\r\nof more or less concentric layers or incrustations. A remarkable\r\nillustration is furnished by the travertine deposits of Tivoli and\r\nother localities near Rome, since here the material supplies a valuable\r\nbuilding stone.\r\n\r\n=Oölitic limestone= (=oolite=).—This rock is made up of spherical\r\nnodules and so has the appearance of fish roe. Broken apart, each grain\r\nreveals in its center a core of siliceous sand about which carbonate\r\nof lime has been deposited in concentric layers. It is thought that\r\nwaters charged with carbonate of lime, in issuing from a river near\r\na sea beach, coat the sand grains of the latter with successive thin\r\nfilms of lime carbonate due to the rhythmic ebb and flow of the tides,\r\nevaporation of the adhering water taking place when the sands are\r\nexposed at low tide.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Sedimentary Rocks of Organic Origin\r\n\r\n=Limestone.=—A generally white or gray rock composed of carbonate of\r\nlime with varying proportions of clay, silica, and other impurities.\r\nThe lime carbonate is usually derived from the hard parts of marine\r\norganisms, and the argillaceous and siliceous impurities from the finer\r\nland-derived sediments which descend with them to the bottom.\r\n\r\n=Dolomite= (=dolomitic or magnesium limestone=).—Differs from\r\nlimestone in containing varying proportions of the mineral dolomite\r\n(_ante_, p. 455), which is made up of equal parts of calcium and\r\nmagnesium carbonates. Difficult to distinguish from limestone unless a\r\nchemical test is made for magnesium, though it may be said in general\r\nthat dolomite is less soluble in cold mineral acids.\r\n\r\n=Peat.=—An accumulation of decomposed vegetable matter within\r\nsmall lakes and in lagoons separated from larger ones (_ante_, p.\r\n429). Peat represents the first stage in the formation of coal\r\nfrom vegetable matter, and differs from the coals by its larger\r\nproportion of contained water. Because of this water its fuel value is\r\ncorrespondingly small. It is usually dark brown or black and reveals\r\nsomething of the structure of the plants out of which it was formed.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Metamorphic Rocks\r\n\r\n=Gneiss.=—A generally more or less banded (gneissic) metamorphic rock\r\nwith a mineral constitution similar to granite, and often developed\r\nby metamorphic processes from that rock. It may at other times, by\r\nprocesses not essentially different, be derived from sedimentary\r\nformations. It usually contains as important constituents unstriated\r\nfeldspar and quartz, but in addition it may include a striated\r\nfeldspar, biotite, muscovite, or hornblende, or several of these\r\ncombined. In proportion as mica or hornblende is abundant, it has a\r\nmarked banded texture, but it differs from mica schist (see below) not\r\nonly in the presence of its feldspar, but in the smaller proportion\r\nof mica. Biotite gneiss, hornblende gneiss, etc., are terms used to\r\ndesignate varieties in which one or the other of the dark colored\r\nconstituents predominate.\r\n\r\n=Mica schist.=—A metamorphic rock without feldspar and mainly composed\r\nof quartz and light colored mica (muscovite). The abundant mica lends\r\nto the rock its characteristic schistose texture, which differs from\r\nthe usual gneissic texture. In some cases the mica is wrapped about\r\nthe grains of quartz, but at other times it forms a series of almost\r\ncontinuous membranes separating layers of quartz.\r\n\r\n=Sericite schist.=—A variety of schist which is characterized by\r\nan abundance of a peculiar silvery mica rich in the element group\r\nhydroxyl. The mica scales are often microscopic and wrought into an\r\nintricate web with the quartz constituent.\r\n\r\n=Talc schist.=—A schist made up largely of talc, but with varying\r\nproportions of quartz, magnetite, etc. From the abundance of the talc\r\nit is usually pale green or white.\r\n\r\n=Chlorite schist.=—A greenish, fine-grained metamorphic rock in which\r\nchlorite is the principal mineral, but in which magnetite is a quite\r\ncharacteristic accessory constituent.\r\n\r\n=Staurolitic garnetiferous mica schist.=—A mica schist in which garnet\r\nand staurolite are so abundant as to be essential constituents.\r\n\r\n=Clay slate.=—A metamorphosed mud stone or shale. In the process of\r\nmetamorphism the rock has been hardened, given a slaty cleavage, and\r\ninnumerable minute scales of mica have developed to produce a silky\r\nluster upon the cleavage faces. The color may be gray, green, purple,\r\nor black.\r\n\r\n=Quartzite.=—A metamorphosed sandstone in which the sand grains have\r\nbecome enlarged by accretion of silica. Whereas a sandstone fractures\r\nabout its constituent grains, a break in quartzite is continued through\r\nthe grains and the cement alike. In contrast to sandstones, the\r\nquartzites derived from them are usually lighter in color and often\r\nnearly white.\r\n\r\n=Marble= (=crystalline limestone=).—The result of metamorphism upon\r\nlimestones. Usually white in color but sometimes gray, blue gray, or\r\nyellow, and sometimes variously broken or brecciated and stained with\r\niron oxide. Effervesces with cold dilute acid.\r\n\r\n=Coals.=—Under the head of peat the first stage in the formation of\r\ncoals from vegetable matter has been briefly described. Lignite, or\r\nbrown coal, represents a further stage and one in which the vegetable\r\nstructure is still recognizable. It is usually brownish black or\r\nblack in color and contains a considerable proportion of water. With\r\nincreased pressure or dynamic metamorphism, further percentages of the\r\nvolatile constituents are eliminated, and when from seventy-five to\r\nninety per cent of carbon remains, the material burns with a yellow\r\nflame and is known as bituminous coal. This is the great fuel for\r\nthe production of steam. A continuation of the metamorphic processes\r\ncarries off a further proportion of the volatile matter and leaves a\r\ndense, hard, black substance with sometimes as much as ninety-five\r\nper cent of carbon. This is the so-called “hard coal” or anthracite\r\ngenerally used for fuel in our houses, for which purpose it is so well\r\nadapted because it burns with a production of much heat and almost\r\nwithout smoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX C\r\n\r\nTHE PREPARATION OF TOPOGRAPHICAL MAPS\r\n\r\n\r\n=Topographical maps a library of physiography.=—For the satisfactory\r\nworking out in detail of the geology of any region of complex\r\nstructure, an accurate topographical map is prerequisite. This is so\r\nmuch the more true because nearly all complexly folded or faulted rock\r\nmasses are to be found in mountainous, or at least in hilly regions.\r\nThe making of the topographical map must, therefore, precede that of\r\nthe geological map, and in modern usage the latter is a topographical\r\nand a geological map combined in one.\r\n\r\nWithin certain narrow limits, predictions concerning the geological\r\nhistory of a province may often be made by an expert geologist from\r\nexamination of an accurate topographical map. Just as in forecasting\r\nthe weather upon the basis of the usual weather maps, such predictions\r\ncan sometimes be made with entire confidence in their accuracy,\r\nwhile at other times a guess only may be hazarded. The great value\r\nof the modern topographical map is becoming, however, universally\r\nacknowledged, and every highly civilized nation has either completed\r\nor has in preparation sectional topographical maps of its domain on\r\nsuch a scale as is warranted by its financial condition and its state\r\nof development. Thus there is now being accumulated a vast library of\r\ngeographical and to some extent geological information, of which the\r\nstudent of geology must be prepared to make use.\r\n\r\n=The nature of a contour map.=—More and more the contour map is\r\nreplacing the earlier and less scientific methods of representing\r\ntopography on the large scale sectional maps, and hence this type only\r\nneed here be considered. In the contour map, the relief of the land\r\nis represented by a series of curving lines, each the intersection of\r\na particular horizontal plane with the land surface, and the several\r\nplanes separated by uniform differences of elevation. This altitude\r\ninterval is known as the contour interval. Its choice is a matter\r\nof considerable importance, for though regions of relatively simple\r\ntopography may be adequately represented upon a map of large contour\r\ninterval, say one hundred feet, another district may require an\r\ninterval as short as five feet. A contour map with this interval may be\r\nconceived to have been made by flooding the region which it represents\r\nand preparing maps of the shore lines for each rise of five feet of the\r\nwater surface, and superimposing the several maps thus derived with\r\naccurate registration one above the other. Wherever the land slopes\r\nare steep, the shore lines of the several maps will be crowded closely\r\ntogether and give the effect of a relatively dark local shade; where,\r\nupon the other hand, the surface is relatively flat, the several shores\r\nwill be widely spaced and the effect will be to produce a white area\r\nupon the map. Thus in contour maps dark tones indicate steep gradients\r\nand pale tones a flatness of surface.\r\n\r\n=The selection of scale and contour interval.=—With the use of\r\nthe small scale in the contour map, the tones of the map will be\r\ncorrespondingly dark, though the relative differences in tone will\r\nremain the same. With the use of a closer contour interval the tones\r\nwill deepen throughout. The adjustment of scale and contour interval\r\nto any given region is a matter requiring experience in topographical\r\nmapping, and in addition a knowledge of the geological significance of\r\ntopographic features. Unfortunately, the element of expense and the\r\nspecial commercial objects held in view, conspire to select scales\r\nand contour intervals which are often little adapted to the districts\r\nsurveyed.\r\n\r\n=The method of preparing a topographical map.=—Having fixed upon the\r\nscale and the contour interval which is to be employed, the task of\r\nthe topographical surveyor is next to fix accurately the positions and\r\nthe elevations of a sufficient number of points to _control_ the map,\r\nand then to hang, as it were, upon these points as attachments the\r\ndesign represented by the relief. Were the surface of the ground to\r\nbe represented by a flexible fabric, the map maker might raise from a\r\nflat base a series of stout posts of the heights and in the positions\r\nwhich he has determined, and upon these supports arrange the slopes of\r\nthe fabric much as drapery is adjusted. The determination of the exact\r\npositions and the elevations of his control stations is, therefore,\r\na process coldly precise and formal; whereas in the shaping of the\r\nsurfaces his attention should be fixed more upon correctly reproducing\r\nthe shapes than upon fixing accurately the position of every point.\r\nAs a matter of fact, the position of the average point will be most\r\naccurately fixed when the shapes of the features are most clearly\r\ncomprehended. To some extent, therefore, the topographer should be\r\nfamiliar with the geological significance of the earth features which\r\nhe is representing.\r\n\r\n=Laboratory exercises in the preparation of topographical maps.=—The\r\nprinciples which underlie the surveyor’s method for preparing a\r\ntopographical map may be learned in the laboratory by the use of\r\nmodels and the simple device shown in plate 24 A and B. To represent\r\nthe section of country to be mapped a model in plaster of Paris is\r\nsubstituted, and this is placed within a rectangular tank to which\r\nlocating carriages and altitude gauges are attached that allow the\r\nstudent to fix the position and the elevation of any point upon the\r\nsurface of the model.\r\n\r\n┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n│   PLATE 24.                                                      │\r\n│                                                                  │\r\n│ [Illustration: _A._ Apparatus for exercise in the preparation of │\r\n│ topographic maps.]                                               │\r\n│                                                                  │\r\n│ [Illustration: _B._ The same apparatus in use for testing the    │\r\n│ contours of a map.]                                              │\r\n│                                                                  │\r\n│ [Illustration: _C._ Modeling apparatus in use.]                  │\r\n└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\r\n\r\nUpon each model the student “locates”, or fixes, the position of a\r\nsufficient number of points for the control of his map, entering upon\r\nan appropriate map base for each position the altitude which was read\r\nfrom the gauges. Now _with the map always before him_ he “sketches in”\r\nthe forms of the surface by means of contour lines. For this purpose\r\nit is often desirable to fix roughly the direction of the steepest\r\nslope at a number of places, and noting the differences in elevation\r\nbetween control stations, divide up the distance in accordance with the\r\ncurves of slope and start the contours at right angles to the slope.\r\nAfterwards such sections are connected by sketching in with the model\r\nalways in view for control (Fig. 488).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 488.—A student’s map prepared from a model by the\r\nuse of the contour apparatus represented in plate 24 A.]\r\n\r\n=The verification of the map.=—The map prepared, its accuracy may be\r\ntested by a simple method which is denied the topographer who has to\r\ndo with the actual surface of the ground. The locating carriages and\r\naltitude gauges are removed from the tank, which is next filled with\r\nwater and leveled by means of guide marks upon the interior. A few\r\ndrops of milk or of ordinary clothes blueing are added to the water to\r\nrender it opaque, and it is then drawn off at the faucet in successive\r\ninstallments, so that the surface drops by layers corresponding in\r\nthickness to the contour interval of the map, plate 24 B. As each layer\r\nis withdrawn, that contour of the map to which the shore line should\r\ncorrespond is carefully examined and corrected. By such corrections\r\nthe nature of the first errors made is soon appreciated, and the\r\nmethod of procedure is thus more easily acquired. At the same time the\r\nsignificance of the design of the map is more quickly learned than by a\r\nmere examination of the standard government maps.\r\n\r\nThe work above outlined calls for waterproofed models of suitable form\r\nand size, and a series, each of which sets forth some typical feature\r\nor series of features, has been designed by Mr. Irving D. Scott.[2]\r\n\r\n=The preparation of physiographic models.=—The apparatus used\r\nto prepare the topographic map is adapted also for preparing a\r\nphysiographic model from a standard topographical map. For this purpose\r\nthe method is essentially reversed, though the tank is replaced to\r\nadvantage by a light metal frame elevated upon one side so as to permit\r\na free use of the hands in modeling the clay.\r\n\r\nThe material used in preparing the model is artists’ modeling clay[3]\r\nwhich has a base of beef suet, and hence does not dry out and crack as\r\ndoes ordinary clay. Its form is, therefore, retained indefinitely, and\r\nit may be used again and again. Most maps must be enlarged in modeling,\r\nand the simplest way is often to photographically or by pantograph\r\nenlarge the map to the scale of the model. The map prepared, it is\r\ncovered by a thin celluloid plate which has cut upon it a series of\r\ncrossed lines spaced in inches and larger subdivisions to correspond to\r\nthose of the locating carriages (plate 24 C).\r\n\r\nThe enlargement of the map is not essential to experienced workers,\r\nand the standard map may be covered in similar manner by a transparent\r\nplate with “checkerboard” design, the squares of which bear some simple\r\nrelation in size to the larger divisions of the locating carriages\r\n(Plate 24 C, rear).\r\n\r\nThe method of preparing the model is comparatively simple. Beginning at\r\nany point upon the map, the intersection of a heavy contour line with\r\none of the guide lines of the celluloid “position plate” is carefully\r\nnoted. Both the position and the elevation of this point are fixed by\r\nthe point of the altitude gauge of the modeling frame, and the clay\r\nbuilt up beneath it to that height. With the fingers the clay is now\r\nroughly shaped in various directions from this point, the altitude\r\ngauge is advanced by the locating carriage so as to correspond in\r\nposition to the intersection of the next heavy contour line with the\r\nsame guide line of the position plate, and the elevation for this point\r\nsimilarly adjusted upon the model. As before, the surface of the clay\r\nis roughly shaped in advance and upon the sides so as to conform to\r\nthe indications of the map; and this process is repeated until the\r\nwork is finished. Corrections for intermediate positions may be\r\ncarried to any desired degree of refinement which the scale and the\r\naccuracy of the map permit. Models which are larger than the area of\r\nthe modeling frame are prepared by making a square foot at a time by\r\nthe above described process, and then moving the frame forward and\r\nadjusting in a new position by means of the sharp pins in the legs\r\nof the apparatus.\r\n\r\n\r\n READING REFERENCES\r\n\r\n WILLIAM H.

The drum-shaped blocks serve to represent massive rocks\r\nwhich occur in irregularly shaped masses such as batholites and flows.\r\nThe long, narrow strips are for intrusive rocks in the form of dikes,\r\nwhile the larger blocks provided with a swivel joint are used for\r\noutcrops of sedimentary rocks, and after adjustment they give the dip\r\nand strike of the exposure.

All these blocks can be made by an ordinary carpenter, and\r\nshould be available in sufficient numbers to arrange problems like\r\nthose of Figs. 47, 48, and 490. With a view to supplying suggestions\r\nfor other problems of the same general nature, the three additional\r\nfield maps of Fig. 491 have been introduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 490.—Special laboratory table set with a problem\r\nin geological mapping which is solved in Figs. 47 and 48.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 491.—Three field maps to be used as suggestions in\r\narranging laboratory tables for problems in the preparation of areal\r\ngeological maps.]\r\n\r\nThe list of questions given below is intended to indicate the nature of\r\nsome of the problems which the student should be asked to solve in the\r\npreparation of each map.

The pilgrimages whose\r\nitineraries are here suggested have been planned especially for\r\nimpressing by observation the lessons of this book. Such journeys are\r\nbest interrupted at a relatively small number of localities which,\r\nbecause already studied in some detail, are specially adapted to serve\r\nas centers for local excursions. These localities will in most cases\r\nbe the great scenic places to which tourists resort, or the seats of\r\nuniversities near which specially detailed explorations have been often\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nWithin the United States a few local geological guides have been\r\npublished, and the Geologic Folios published by the United States\r\nGeological Survey are already available for a number of such centers.\r\nFor one long geological pilgrimage we are fortunate in having a\r\ncarefully prepared guide, namely, from New York to the Yellowstone\r\nNational Park and back, with a side trip to the Grand Cañon of the\r\nColorado. Except for the side trip this route, in large measure,\r\ncorresponds with one here chosen, and for the return journey especially\r\nthe student is referred to it for information (Geological Guide Book of\r\nthe Rocky Mountain Excursion, edited by Samuel Franklin Emmons. Comte\r\nRendu de la Congrés Géologique Internationale, 5me Session, Washington,\r\n1891, 1893, pp. 253-487, map and plates 13, figs. 32).\r\n\r\nOur journey is begun at New York City, which is built about the deeply\r\nsubmerged channels of an estuary choked with glacial deposits, though\r\nthe channel may be followed as a deep cañon across the continental\r\nshelf to its margin (252,[4] pl. 17 B). New York City is also upon the\r\nmargin of the glaciated area, the outer terminal moraine of which is\r\nwell represented on Long Island (298). Across the Hudson in New Jersey\r\nis the great Coastal Plain which meets the oldland in a well-defined\r\nmargin (159, 246, 247). A local geological guide of the vicinity of the\r\nmetropolis has been written by Gratacap (Geology of the City of New\r\nYork, Greater New York. Brentanos, New York, 1904, pp. 119, pls. and\r\nmap).\r\n\r\nTraveling by the New York Central Railway, we follow up the Mohawk\r\noutlet of the glacial lakes Iroquois and Algonquin (334), first\r\nskirting upon the east the great sills of intrusive basalt known as the\r\nPalisades, with their markedly columnar jointing and intersections by\r\nnumerous faults. Above Peekskill we enter the picturesque narrows of\r\nthe river (174), cut in the hard crystalline rocks of the Highlands.\r\nEntering the Mohawk Valley, we pass Syracuse with limestone caverns\r\nand well-oriented joints widened by solution through the agency of the\r\ndescending ground water (181, pl. 6 B). A branch line to the southwest\r\nreaches the vicinity of Cayuga Lake and Ithaca, where are well-oriented\r\njoints which have controlled the drainage directions, and there is also\r\na typical strath (55, 87, 428).\r\n\r\nTo Niagara Falls at least a day should be allotted for the “gorge ride”\r\nby trolley car, thus making the complete circuit of the brink of the\r\ngorge with interruptions and local studies at all important points\r\n(352-366, pl. 23 A). From Niagara Falls over the Michigan Central\r\nRailway we reach Detroit on the present outlet of the upper Great Lakes\r\nas well as of the later Lake Algonquin (334). From this city as a\r\ncenter a trip is made by electric railway to Ypsilanti and Ann Arbor,\r\nacross the bottoms of the early glacial lakes from the first Maumee to\r\nWarren (330-333). The strong Whittlesey beach is encountered at the\r\nlittle station of Ridge Road, and one of the Maumee beaches on Summer\r\nStreet in Ypsilanti. The city of Ypsilanti is built upon a terrace\r\n(165) of the Huron River, and another terrace in the same series is\r\ncrossed by the electric line. In an excursion of a few miles down the\r\nriver, passing meanders (164-165) and ox-bow lakes (165, 415), is\r\nfound an interesting case of stream capture near the little village of\r\nRawsonville (175. See Isaiah Bowman, Jour. Geol., Vol. 12, 1904, pp.\r\n326-334).\r\n\r\nContinuing our journey from Ypsilanti over a high moraine (312), Ann\r\nArbor is reached, built upon the level plain of outwash with fosses\r\nsometimes separating it from the moraine (281, 314). Upon the campus of\r\nthe university are great bowlders of jasper conglomerate and jaspilite,\r\nwhich were transported from the north by the continental glacier (305).\r\nAcross the river from the Michigan Central station and behind the\r\nlittle church is a delta formed in one of the glacial lakes Maumee and\r\nhere opened in section (168). West of the city is a great valley which\r\nwas the former course of the Huron River when thus diverted by the\r\ncontinental glacier lying to the eastward of Ann Arbor—border drainage\r\n(see Ann Arbor folio by the U. S. G. S., and, further, R. C. Allen and\r\nI. D. Scott, An Aid to Geological Field Studies in the Vicinity of Ann\r\nArbor, George Wahr, publisher, Ann Arbor).\r\n\r\nReturning to Detroit (M. C. Ry.), the great Sibley quarries in\r\nlimestone near Trenton may be visited. They display perfect jointing,\r\nnumerous fossils, and especially well-glaciated surfaces interrupted\r\nby deep troughs and showing striæ of several glaciations (304). From\r\nDetroit the journey is continued by steamer to Mackinac Island in the\r\nstrait connecting Lakes Michigan and Huron, passing on the way through\r\nthe peculiar delta of the St. Clair River (431), and coming in view of\r\nthe notched headlands, which are a monument to the post-glacial uplift\r\nof the glaciated area (250, 341). A day is spent at Mackinac Island\r\nand St. Ignace in order to study with some care these uplifted strands\r\nof the late glacial lakes (341-344). Chicago may now be reached either\r\nby steamer or by rail, and in its vicinity we may see the elevated\r\nbeaches and the ancient outlet of Lake Chicago (331-332, 347, pl. 22\r\nA. See Chicago Folio, U. S. G. S.). By the Chicago and Northwestern\r\nRailway the area of recessional moraines and intermediate outwash\r\nplains, and later that of the drumlins, are crossed in journeying to\r\nMadison, Wisconsin. By examination of the maps on pages 308 and 317\r\nin connection with the larger scale atlas sheets of the United States\r\nGeological Survey (Janesville, Evansville, and Madison sheets), this\r\ncar journey can be made most instructive in gaining familiarity with\r\nthe characteristic glacial features, and this study is continued to\r\nspecial advantage in excursions about Madison as a center (316-317,\r\n407). This is the more true since at numerous localities in the\r\nvicinity of Madison the well-striated glacier pavement is exposed for\r\ncomparison of the striæ as regards direction with the axes of the\r\nseveral types of glacial features.\r\n\r\nAn especially instructive excursion may be made by carriage in a single\r\nday to the “driftless area” some twelve miles west of the city. Before\r\nreaching it we cross in alternation a series of recessional terminal\r\nmoraines (pl. 17 C) and outwash plains, and near Cross Plains encounter\r\nthe partially dissected upland with its arborescent drainage and\r\neven sky line (298, 300-301, 312-313, pl. 16 A and B). Typical shore\r\nformations (233, 241, 242) are studied to advantage about Lake Mendota\r\nin a walking trip to and beyond Picnic Point, where are found the best\r\nice ramparts (431-434. See Buckley, Trans. Wis. Acad. Sci., Vol. 13,\r\npp. 141-162, pls. 18).\r\n\r\nOur journey is now continued over the Chicago and Northwestern Railway\r\nto Devils Lake near Baraboo, where we cross a salient of the driftless\r\narea, within which lies Devils Lake, imprisoned in a former valley of\r\nthe Wisconsin River, since diverted to another course as a result of\r\nthe glacial invasion (312-313). The valley here is a former narrows in\r\nhard quartzite (466), which towers above the lake in unstable chimneys\r\n(300), such as the Devils Tower, but such remnants are not found on\r\nthe other side of the moraine, being there replaced by rounded rock\r\nshoulders. Just north of the lake the marginal moraine which blocks\r\nthe valley is so characteristic as to merit special study (pl. 17\r\nC). Only a few miles northward along the railway from Devils Lake is\r\nAbleman, where, exposed in a high cliff, the hard purple quartzite\r\nwith beautiful ripple marks to reveal its plane of sedimentation\r\n(pl. 11 A) dips vertically, and is overlain by horizontally bedded\r\nyellow sandstone. The marked angular unconformity which is thus\r\ndisplayed is further made evident by a basal layer of conglomerate\r\n(463) in the sandstone (51-53). Here also are deposits of loess along\r\nthe river, which display their vertical joint surfaces (207). An\r\nexcellent geological guide to this interesting district and that of\r\nthe neighboring “Dalles” of the Wisconsin River has been written by\r\nSalisbury and Atwood (The Geography of the Region about Devils Lake and\r\nthe Dalles of the Wisconsin, etc., Bull. 5, Wis. Geol. and Nat. Hist.\r\nSurv., 1900, pp. 151, pls. 38, figs. 47).\r\n\r\nIf we have taken a conveyance at Devils Lake for Ableman, we may\r\ncontinue in the same manner to Kilbourn, where begin the picturesque\r\nDalles of the Wisconsin River—here a young gorge cut in sandstone,\r\nbecause the Wisconsin was diverted from its old valley to border\r\ndrainage at the edge of the driftless area (300, 321). The side cañons\r\nof the river, through their abrupt zigzags, reveal the control of their\r\ncourses by the joint system (224). In the journey up the rapids by\r\nsteamer to inspect the Dalles, we observe many beautiful examples of\r\ncross bedding in the sandstone (37).\r\n\r\nFrom Kilbourn we continue our journey to Minneapolis over the Chicago,\r\nMilwaukee, and St. Paul Railway, and near Camp Douglas are over a\r\npeneplain, out of which rise prominent monadnocks (171). At La Crosse\r\nthe Mississippi River is reached, flowing beneath bluffs of sandstone\r\nwhich are capped by loess (207). The meanderings and the numerous\r\ncut-offs of the Mississippi may be observed to the left (415). Lake\r\nPepin is a side-delta lake blocked by the deposits of the Chippewa\r\nRiver (419).\r\n\r\nFrom Minneapolis an excursion is made to Fort Snelling to view the\r\nyoung gorge of the Mississippi, cut by the Falls of St. Anthony for a\r\ndistance of about eight miles in manner similar to that of the seven\r\nmiles of Niagara gorge (354), and to compare this narrow gorge with\r\nthe broad valley of the Warren River which drained Lake Agassiz (327).\r\nSomewhat farther up the Warren River are examples of saucer lakes (416).\r\n\r\nFrom Minneapolis the journey may be continued by the Great Northern\r\nRailway to Livingston, Montana, thus crossing between the stations of\r\nMuscoda and Buffalo the bed of Lake Agassiz and its marginal beaches\r\n(325-328. For local geology of Minnesota consult C. W. Hall, Geology of\r\nMinnesota, Vol. 1, Minneapolis, 1903).\r\n\r\nThe Yellowstone Park is entered from Livingston (Livingston Geological\r\nFolio, U. S. G. S.) and departure from it made at the relatively\r\nnew Union Pacific terminal at the southwest margin. The regular\r\ntrip through the Park includes visits to the several geyser basins\r\n(191-194), Obsidian Cliff (33, 463), the Cañon of the Yellowstone, etc.\r\nGood climbers can make a side trip from near the Mammoth Hot Springs\r\nto the top of Quadrant Mountain, the remnant of a “biscuit cut” upland\r\n(372), and there study the nivation process (368, Yellowstone National\r\nPark Folio, U. S. G. S.).\r\n\r\nThe trip from the Park to Salt Lake City, over the Union Pacific\r\nRailway, passes through the Red Rock Pass, the former outlet of Lake\r\nBonneville (423), into the desert of the Great Basin (Chaps. XV and\r\nXVI). Great Salt Lake is a saline lake or sink with an interesting\r\nrecord of climatic changes (198, 401). The front of the Wasatch Range,\r\nin view and easily reached from Salt Lake City, is deeply scored by\r\nthe horizontal shore terraces of Lake Bonneville (198, 199), and\r\nthese terraces are extended at every reëntrant by barrier beaches of\r\ngreat perfection. In the Pleistocene period mountain glaciers in part\r\noccupied the valleys of this range, though they did not always extend\r\nas far as the mountain front. Big Cottonwood Cañon, which realizes this\r\ncondition, and the neighboring Little Cottonwood Cañon, from whose\r\nfront its glacier spread into an expanded foot (264), thus show for\r\ncomparison in a single view the V and the low U sections respectively\r\n(172, 376). Here are also alluvial fans (213) and recent faults which\r\nintersect them.\r\n\r\nFrom Salt Lake City the return to New York may be made by the Denver\r\nand Rio Grande Railway across deserts and through the Royal Gorge,\r\nthe cañon of the Arkansas River. A full itinerary of the points of\r\ngeological interest along this route, and continued to Chicago,\r\nWashington, and New York, is supplied in much detail in the guide of\r\nthe geological excursion to the Rocky Mountains above cited. This\r\nthe traveling geologist should not fail to study. Some references to\r\npoints along this journey will be found on preceding pages of this\r\nbook (219-220, High Plains; 170, Allegheny Plateau in West Virginia;\r\n176, water gap of Harper’s Ferry; 176-177, 184-186, side trip up the\r\nShenandoah Valley to Luray Caverns and Snickers Gap; 251, Chesapeake\r\nBay).\r\n\r\nInstead of returning directly from Salt Lake City, the traveler,\r\nif he has sufficient time at his disposal, may extend his journey\r\nsouthwestward across the Great Basin to Los Angeles. A branch line\r\nfrom this route leaves the Vegas Valley and passes within reach of the\r\nfamous Death Valley (201) to Tonopah (79) and the Owens Valley (77-78,\r\n92), where are many surface faults dating from the earthquake of 1872\r\nand other less recent disturbances. Returning to the junction point,\r\nthe route continues across the Colorado and Mohave deserts to Los\r\nAngeles. From Los Angeles as a center the exceptionally interesting\r\nterraces, caves, and stacks of an uplifted coast are to be seen\r\nto best advantage near Pt. Harford (Chap. XIX). The islands of San\r\nClemente and Santa Catalina may also be reached from Los Angeles (239,\r\n248, 249, 250, 256, 257, pls. 5 B, 7 A, 12 A). The return to the East,\r\nif made by the Santa Fe Railway, permits of a visit to the Grand Cañon\r\n(174, 443) from the station of Williams. From that point eastward the\r\ngeology of the route is fully covered in Emmons’ Guide to the Rocky\r\nMountain Excursion already cited.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of those who are privileged to travel in Europe, and\r\nthe number increases yearly, a pilgrimage is suggested which may easily\r\nbe made to correspond with plans laid out on the basis of historical,\r\nartistic, and scenic points of interest. The only popular guide of a\r\ngeneral nature written for geologists traveling abroad appears to be\r\na brief but valuable little paper by Professor Lane (The Geological\r\nTourist in Europe, Popular Science Monthly, Vol. 33, 1888, pp.\r\n216-229). The publishing house of Gebrüder Bornträger in Berlin is\r\nnow publishing a quite valuable series of geological guides dealing\r\nwith special districts and written by well-known authorities (Sammlung\r\nGeologischer Führer). Of this series some thirteen numbers have already\r\nbeen issued. Many other valuable local guides of a geological nature\r\nare the Livrets Guides of the International Geological and Geographical\r\nCongresses, and the similar pamphlets supplied in connection with\r\nannual meetings of national or provincial geological societies.\r\n\r\nPassengers on steamships sailing from the harbor of New York pass\r\nout over a deeply submerged cañon (252) largely filled with glacial\r\ndeposits, through the Narrows (174), and in sight of Sandy Hook, a\r\nmodified spit (238, 240). To the left are seen the great morainic\r\naccumulations at the border of the glaciated area on Long Island (298).\r\nIn the course of the trans-Atlantic voyage a much-rounded iceberg may\r\nbe encountered (291), though this is much more apt to occur upon the\r\nnorthern routes from Quebec, and late in the season. Upon entering the\r\nEnglish Channel the land on both coasts rises in steep cliffs, where\r\nare found all the common shore features well developed (Chap. XVIII).\r\nThe German steamships pass in sight of Heligoland, that last remnant of\r\nwave erosion (236).\r\n\r\nWhile traveling in Europe, the student should consult a map of the\r\nglaciated area (299), and so learn to recognize its peculiarities, and\r\ncarefully mark its marginal moraine (311) and other strongly marked\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nIf the British Isles are visited and the more rugged areas are\r\nselected, one may study the cirques and other characteristic features\r\ndue to the presence of mountain glaciers about Snowdon (Chap. XXVI).\r\nMore mature stages of the same processes are to be found in the\r\nScottish Highlands and the Inner Hebrides, but especially upon the\r\nIsland of Skye (Fig. 492). A very valuable aid to excursions in\r\nthis district is Baddeley’s Scotland (part I, Dulau, London) and\r\nSir Archibald Geikie’s Explanatory Notes to accompany Bartholomew’s\r\nGeological Map of Scotland (map and notes in cover, Edinburgh, 1892,\r\npp. 23).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 492.—Sketch map of Western Scotland and the\r\nInner Hebrides to show location of some points of special geological\r\ninterest.]\r\n\r\nIt is from Oban, the “Charing Cross of the Highlands”, that one should\r\nstart out upon the summer steamers in order to reach both Skye and\r\nStaffa, the latter with fine basaltic columns (463), and Fingal’s\r\nCave. In sailing to Skye one passes upon either shore of the narrow\r\nfjords many relics left in the dissection of volcanoes (139-143 and\r\nSir A. Geikie, Ancient Volcanoes of Great Britain, Vol. II); also\r\nrocky islands and skerries marking submergence (252), and the coast\r\nterraces which register a later uplift (250). Skye is a complex of\r\nmany intrusive and volcanic rocks of such markedly different colors\r\nas to appear as tints in the landscape. In the Cuchillin Hills of dark\r\ngreen rises the massive gabbro (462) cut by cirques into the jagged\r\npinnacles of horns and comb ridges (373); while lower down and to the\r\neast are rounded domes of rhyolite (463) abraded beneath the glaciers\r\nand of a delicate salmon tint. Still lower and to the westward are\r\nflat mesas composed of horizontal layers of black basalt under a rich\r\ncarpeting of the brightest verdure. Eastward across the channel are\r\nseen the purplish walls of an ancient sandstone. The jagged gabbro\r\ncore of the island thus represents a fretted upland (372) and is now\r\nthe training ground of the Alpinist (Abraham, Rock Climbing in Skye,\r\nLongmans, London, 1908), while nestled in one of the bottoms of a\r\nU-valley is Loch Coruisk, a typical rock-basin lake (412), its shores\r\nof hard rock planed and scored.\r\n\r\nFrom Skye we may go to study the remarkable thrusts (45) on the north\r\nshore of Loch Maree, a marked lineament, and one directed at right\r\nangles to that on the course of the Caledonian Canal connecting\r\nLoch Linne with Loch Ness. This northeast wall of Loch Maree is a\r\nstrikingly rectilinear fault represented by an escarpment, up which\r\nwe climb to find at the top the crushed and fluted thrust planes of\r\nmovement dipping southeastward at a flat angle. Here also are beautiful\r\nrock-basin lakes, lying in hollows molded beneath the continental\r\nglacier. On our way from Skye we have passed up Loch Carron, a sea loch\r\nor fjord (252), and along the strath at its head known as Strathcarron\r\n(428).\r\n\r\nReturning now to Oban, it is but a short trip by steamer up Loch Linne\r\nto Fort William along the striking lineament (226) which continues to\r\nLoch Ness and beyond (Fig. 492), and thence by rail to Glen Roy and the\r\nneighboring glens of Lochaber (322-325).\r\n\r\nFrom Paris as a starting point, we may visit in a most picturesque\r\nregion the beautifully preserved craters of extinct volcanoes in the\r\nAuvergne of Central France (105, 124, 145), which district is entered\r\nfrom Clermont-Ferrand. Here are found the characteristic puys, steep\r\nlava domes of viscous lava (105), which figured largely in the early\r\ncontroversies of geologists concerning the origin of rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 493.—Outline map of a geological pilgrimage across\r\nthe continent of Europe.]\r\n\r\nThe rest of our pilgrimage will be so planned as to enter the noble\r\nriver Rhine at its mouth (Fig. 493), ascend its course to its\r\nbirthplace in the snows of Switzerland, and after further exploration\r\nof the features of this fretted upland, traverse northern and central\r\nItaly so as to make our departure for America by the southern route.\r\nEntering then upon this course in the Low Countries, we have first\r\nthe opportunity of observing the characteristics of a great delta\r\nwith natural levees artificially strengthened as dikes (165-168).\r\nHere also are found dunes of beach material which has been raised by\r\nthe wind into a great rampart near the shore (209-211). Such a wall\r\nof dune sand is well displayed at the bathing resort at Scheveningen\r\nnear the Hague (421). The flood plain of the Rhine (162-165) may be\r\nstudied in a journey up the river to the university town of Bonn, from\r\nwhence a day’s excursion should be devoted to the relics of volcanoes\r\nknown as the Seven Mountains (H. von Dechen, Geognostischer Führer in\r\ndas Siebengebirge, Bonn, 1861). As a preparation for this trip and\r\nothers in the volcanic Eifel higher up the river, a visit should be\r\nmade to the mineral and rock collections of the Poppelsdorfer Schloss\r\nat the University. In the volcanic Eifel are found some of the most\r\ninteresting of crater lakes (405), the largest being Lake Laach\r\nwith its somewhat peculiar volcanic ejectamenta and its picturesque\r\nabbey (see von Dechen, Geognostischer Führer zu der Vulkanreihe der\r\nVorder-Eifel, etc., Bonn, 1886. Consult also Lane, A Geological Tourist\r\nin Europe, _l.c._).\r\n\r\nContinuing our course up the river from Bonn, we soon enter the gorge\r\nof the Rhine cut in an uplifted peneplain (169, 171, 174). From\r\nCoblenz, where the Moselle enters the Rhine, a side trip may be made up\r\nthis tributary river past Zell with its entrenched meanders (173) to\r\nthe ancient Roman city of Treves. Above Bingen on the Rhine we leave\r\nbehind us the narrow gorge and rapid current of the river and continue\r\nover the broad floor at the bottom of a rift valley (403), lying\r\nbetween the forest of Odin and the Black Forest on the east and the\r\n“Blue Alsatian Mountains” far away to the west. At the margins of this\r\nplain are beds of loess with their characteristic joint structures and\r\ninclusions (207), and in the higher hills on either hand a wealth of\r\nintrusive igneous rocks.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance of the Neckar River to this broad plain is nestled the\r\npicturesque castle and university town of Heidelberg, a convenient\r\ncenter for excursions (Julius Ruska, Geologische Streifzüge in\r\nHeidelbergs Umgebung, etc., Nägele, Leipzig, 1908, pp. 208, map).\r\nAt Strassburg (Schwarzwaldstrasse 12) is located the German Chief\r\nStation for Earthquake Study, with a particularly large set of modern\r\nseismographs. In the university cabinet is also one of the largest and\r\nmost representative mineral collections in Europe. For excursions in\r\nthe neighborhood consult Benecke, Sammlung Geognostische Führer, Vol.\r\n5, Elsass, 1900.\r\n\r\nFrom Strassburg we may go by the Black Forest Railway to the Hegau with\r\nits volcanic plugs (140), each surmounted by a picturesque castle.\r\nWe enter next the broadly extended piedmont apron site, above which\r\nLake Constance still remains as a border lake (399). Outwash aprons\r\n(314), moraines (311), and drumlins (317) are each in turn encountered.\r\nStill continuing our course up the Rhine from Bregenz, we enter the\r\nfretted upland (372) of the Alps, mountains composed of great folds and\r\nthrusts about a core of intrusive rock (Rothpletz, Sammlung Geologische\r\nFührer, Vol. 10, 1902, Thrusts in the Alps between Lake Constance and\r\nthe Engadine). Some fourteen miles above Chur we pass the terrace\r\nproduced by successive landslides (414), known far and wide as the\r\nFlimser Bergstürz. The further assent of the cascade stairway of this\r\nglacier-carved valley brings us to the Furka Pass, from which point\r\nmagnificent views of the fretted upland are obtained. At the Känzli, a\r\nmile from the hotel, one may view the névé of the Rhone Glacier, which\r\nmay also be easily visited.\r\n\r\nWe have now followed a great river from its mouth in the sands of\r\nHolland to its source in the snows of the higher Alps. Passing over\r\nthe divide and descending to Gletsch, we may observe the lower end,\r\nor foot, of the Rhone glacier and the crevasses and séracs (391) on\r\nthe steep descent of this radiating glacier (383, 386). The response\r\nwhich glaciers make to climatic changes is here well illustrated by the\r\nrecession of the glacier front from near the hotel (its position in the\r\n’50s of the nineteenth century) to its present position about a mile\r\nfarther up the valley.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of a glaciated mountain valley may be further\r\nillustrated by climbing to the Grimsel Pass, which is scratched and\r\nstriated (377, 385), and then descending the valley of the Aar to\r\nMeyringen (377). Near the Grimsel Hospice are the characteristic rock\r\nbasin lakes (412), and upon the Aar Glacier to our left were carried\r\nout the epoch-making researches of Louis Agassiz, the founder of the\r\nglacial theory for explaining the drift. We encounter some thirteen\r\nrock bars (377). Just before reaching Meyringen we pass the last of\r\nthese, the Gorge of the Aar, cut by the stream through limestone.\r\n\r\nInterlaken (419) may be made the center for additional excursions up\r\nthe Lauterbrunnen Valley, with its prominent albs (376) and its ribbon\r\nfall of the Staubbach (378). By the Jungfrau Mountain railway we may\r\nnow ascend partly in tunnels of the rock to the Ewigeismeer, and look\r\ndown upon the névé and bergschrunds of the Great Aletsch Glacier (370,\r\nsee Baltzer, Sammlung Geologische Führer, Vol. 10, Bernese Oberland,\r\n1906). Returning to Interlaken by way of Grindelwald, one may study the\r\nfoot of a radiating glacier, the Untergrindelwald glacier, with its\r\ntunnel and its milky and braided stream.\r\n\r\nCrossing now the Alpine foreland to Villeneuve at the upper end of\r\nLake Geneva and upon a well-developed strath (426, 428), we may look\r\nout upon the turbid waters extending far from the shore of the lake.\r\nJourneying to Geneva by steamer we note the gradual clearing of the\r\nwater until at the outlet of the lake it is as clear as crystal. A\r\nwalking trip from Geneva takes us to the Bois de la Bâtie, where the\r\nArve with turbid waters meets this clear stream (427).\r\n\r\nThe railroad to Chamonix ascends another cascade stairway (376),\r\naffords views of complexly folded sedimentary rocks (43), and at\r\nChamonix itself the mer de glace supplies opportunities for the study\r\nof moraines (386, 393) and glacial movement (390-392). To experienced\r\nAlpinists the summit of Mount Blanc offers a remarkably extended\r\noutlook over the fretted upland of the Alps (pl. 18 A). From the\r\nstation of LeFayet below Chamonix, one may ascend to the Désert de la\r\nPlaté, where are Schratten in limestone due to solution (188).\r\n\r\nCrossing by one of the passes to the valley of the Rhone at Martigny\r\nwe may reach Zermatt, to-day the climbing center of the Alps. From\r\nthe subordinate cirques surrounding this village descend the Gorner,\r\nFindelen, St. Theodul, and other components of this radiating glacier.\r\nA black tooth of rock, the Matterhorn, towers above the other peaks and\r\nshows to greatest advantage this feature of glacial sculpture (374),\r\nwhile the Gorge of the Gorner is a severed rock bar like that of the\r\nAar (377). Either on foot or over the mountain railway we may ascend to\r\nthe Gorner Grat, a subordinate comb ridge (373) which affords one of\r\nthe most magnificent and instructive views of radiating glaciers.\r\n\r\nFrom Brig, farther up the Rhone Valley, an excursion is made to the\r\nEggishorn Hotel, a center for study on and about the Great Aletsch\r\nGlacier (329, 371, 385, 388, 395, 410). The easy ascent of the\r\nEggishorn is rewarded by a view almost directly downward upon the\r\nice-dammed Márjelen Lake (329, 411).\r\n\r\nFrom Brig one may make his entry into Italy, either over the\r\npicturesque Simplon route afoot or by diligence, or else beneath it\r\nthrough the railway tunnel. By an alternation of short steamboat and\r\nrail trips the journey is continued in a direction transverse to the\r\nlonger axes of the border lakes Maggiore, Lugano, and Como, and later\r\nsouthward to Milan. In leaving the village of Como we pass over heavy\r\nmorainic deposits on the apron borders of the expanded-foot glacier\r\n(383, 385) which once occupied the valley above. On the journey from\r\nMilan to Venice, over the fertile plains of Lombardy, the similar\r\naccumulations about Lake Garda (414) are first encountered at the\r\nlittle station of Lonato and left behind at Somma Campagna (Tornquist,\r\nSammlung Geologische Führer, Vol. 9, Northern Italy, 1902).\r\n\r\nThe city of Venice is built upon pile foundations in the lagoon behind\r\nthe barrier beach known as the Lido (242, 428-429). From here we may\r\nreach the Karst country by way of Trieste, some of the more interesting\r\nand typical features being found near Divača (187-189, 422, pl. 6 A).\r\nIn a different direction from Venice by way of Belluno we enter the\r\nDolomites with their patterned relief and battlemented towers (228,\r\n445).\r\n\r\nAdditional centers for geological excursions on the route to our point\r\nof departure from Italy are Rome and Naples. At the Italian capitol and\r\nin its neighborhood we may study the volcanic Campagna with its beds\r\nof tuff (105) and its crater lakes (405. See Sir A. Geikie, The Roman\r\nCampagna, Landscape in History and other Essays, Macmillan, 1905, pp.\r\n308-352; also Deecke, Sammlung Geologische Führer, Vol. 8, Campagna,\r\n1901). From Rome it is an easy journey to the cataract of Tivoli with\r\nits deposits of travertine (184). In the opposite direction from Rome\r\nacross the Campagna rise the Alban Hills, ruins of a composite cone\r\nwith several crater lakes on the sites of former vents. On the summit\r\nof the encircling crater rim, like the Monte Somma of the Vesuvian\r\nMountain now a crescent only, is located the chief Italian station for\r\nearthquake study.\r\n\r\nFrom Naples we may reach in short excursions and study with some\r\ncare still active volcanic mountains. To the east is Mount Vesuvius\r\n(94, 97, 122, 124, 127-137), which was in grand eruption in April,\r\n1906. Westward from Naples are the Campi Phlegraeii, or burning\r\nfields, with many craters. Of these Astroni offers a fine example of\r\na large-cratered cinder cone (105). In the same vicinity are Monte\r\nNuovo (96) and the Solfatara (97), the latter a type of volcano which\r\nno longer erupts lava, but in its place emits carbon dioxide and other\r\ngaseous emanations (Grotto del Cane). The starting point for excursions\r\nin the Phlegræan fields is Pozzuoli with its Temple of Jupiter Serapis\r\n(254-255), reached from Naples by an electric line which pierces the\r\nwall of an immense crater (Posilippo) composed of fine yellow volcanic\r\nash known as Pozzuolan.\r\n\r\nFrom Naples steamers make short excursions to Sorrento with its deep\r\nash deposits, and to Capri with its blue grotto (257-258). Herculaneum\r\n(139) and Pompeii (122), buried during the eruption of 79 A.D., are on\r\nthe line of the Circum-Vesuvian Railway.\r\n\r\nSteamships to New York from Naples call at Gibraltar, the land-tied\r\nisland _par excellence_ (241). Most steamships of the southern route\r\npass through or near the volcanic islands of the Azores, and certain\r\nboats touch at Algiers, from which a line of railway gives access to\r\nBiskra on the borders of the Desert of Sahara.\r\n\r\nThroughout these pilgrimages the traveler should be on the alert to\r\nnote not only the agent responsible for the features which come under\r\nhis observation, but, especially where this is the common sculpturing\r\nagent of running water, he should not fail to notice the stage of the\r\nerosion cycle which is represented (Chapter XIII).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abrasion, beneath glaciers, 275.\r\n\r\n  Abyssinia, fissure eruptions in, 101.\r\n\r\n  Accordance, of tributary valleys, 162.\r\n\r\n  Adiabatic refrigeration, in relation to glaciers, 262.\r\n\r\n  Adolescence, in cycle of erosion, 169.\r\n\r\n  Advancing hemicycle of glaciation, 263-266.\r\n\r\n  Advective zone, of atmosphere, 270.\r\n\r\n  Aftershocks, of earthquakes, 83.\r\n\r\n  Agassiz, glacial lake, 325-328.\r\n\r\n  Agassiz, Louis, cited, 339, 400.\r\n\r\n  Age, of strata, 38, 52.\r\n\r\n  Aggradation, 162.\r\n\r\n  Aktian deposits, 36.\r\n\r\n  Alaskan coast, map of, 79.\r\n\r\n  Albs, 376.\r\n\r\n  Alden, W.
